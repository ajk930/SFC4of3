cording to thefce advices General Young
was at Condon, November 2t>. having
three troup* of the Third Cavalry. Cun
ninj;ham> scouts and Major March'n bat
talion f.f the Thirty-third Infantry. The
nominal strength of his command had
been reduced one-third by sickness. The
hordes were w<>ra "tit and handicapped
by lark of shor-s. The infantry, after a
marrh of a hundred miles from San Ja-
cinto. were shoeless and all were living
on the Â«-<iuntry. The troop* had no am
munition except what they carried â :,
their belt*. General Young, huvlr.tr then
been without communication with Gen
eral Lawton for ten days and not know-
Ing the disposition of the other troops or
whether support was being sent forward,
resolved to keep moving.
Having rec< ived information that the
insurgent General Tino. with a thousand
men. uas somewhere to the north and
that Agulnaldo. with General Pilar. five
women and 400 soldiers of his faithful
Hulncan battalion, was in the mountain*
to the east. General Young derided, on
SCorember 2<i, to divide his force. He pro
ceeded hlmaelf toward Vigan. hoping to
Attack Tino with his handful of men and
to prevent his Joining Agulnaldo. Major
}.!nreh. with his battalion and Cunning
ham's scouts, started over the mountains
t"ward Cervantes "after Agulnaldo. who
vas reported to have been there on No
vember Z*. This column marched for
thirteen hours without food.
The Associated Press correspondent
fi.cn on to Fay: "The Americans found
that the Insurgents had Impressed the
Itorrotes. compelling thorn tÂ«Â» <llr trenches
and to construct pitfalls alone the trails,
â which were fearful traveling at the host.
OnÂ«> stream had to be forded twelve times
In the course of a mile. These : naive,
t-tupld creatures, usually pictured as
Mnodthirsty savages, cheerfully returned
to undo their work and actually went for
aging for <he Americans. The llocos re
pion is the richest the Americans have
Â«ncountrrÂ«d In the northern campaign.
The linens are prosperous, intelligent and
more than half civilized. They have ex
c<Jlent houses and carry on flourishing
Industries. Many of them are evidently
rich. Several towns received the troops
â with bands and the ringing of church
bells. Cattle were killed and houses were
opened to the troops.
"How much of this display was sincere
end how much due to n desire to propltl
nte the conquerors It would be hard to
ray. There were evidences that similar
hospitality had been extended to Agul
naldo. The people described him as cheer
ful, hugging the hope of salvation through
American politics anJ everywhere trying
to retain support by proclaiming with
iteming rlncerity that the United Spates
Congress would certainly recognize the
Independence of the Filipino republic in
Ijccember.
"Many of the natives exhibited note*
from Lieutenant Gilmore and other
American prisoners in which the 'recip
ients were commended to the Americans
on the pcore of klndmss shown to the
writers. There ore twenty-seven Ameri
cans with Lieutenant Gilmore. Another
party of fourteen was taken through
Ilocos a wf-ek ahead of General Young,
They were ragged and dirty, and the na
tives say some of them were urged for

DECISION INVOLVING
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
Ln Abra Claim Against the Republic
of Mexico Declared to Be
Fraudulent.
WASHINGTON. Dee. 11.â The United
States Supreme I'ourt to-<lay aflirmcd the
opinion of the Court of Claims in the case
of the claim of the I.a Abra Silver Mining
Company against the republic of Mexico,
holding: that claim to be fraudulent and
unfounfied. The claim was for about
$4.000.0(Â«.
The opinion was handed down by Jus
tice Harlnn. who w.ent fully Into the his
tory of the case. He paid that the claim
â Â«> ilrst â¢â¢' to the American-Mexi
can Commission in lWi was for J1.950.000.
but that it was afterward enlarged to
53.962.000. it Â»'Â»> bared upon the allega
tion that damage to this amount had been
done to the I.a Mini company by the.
Mexican authorities while th*- company
was operating in the Mexican State of
Durango. The commission, through its
umpire. Sir Edward Thornton, has al
lowed $653.041, and the case came before
the Supreme Court on appeal from a de
cision of the Court of Claims that fraud
had been perpetrated in presenting the
c lf\ m Ji ?" stlce Harlnn's opinion affirmed
this decision. He said that the evidence ,
kno wed that the whole story of loss on .
account of the misconduct of the Mexican *
authorities was Improbable and un
founded and that the company while
bankrupt, was not so because of 'the acts
of Mexican authorities. The effect of

GATACRE'S DEFEAT DELAYS THE
INVASION OF THE FREE STATE
CAPE TOWN, Dec. 12.â 1t is reported that heavy Sip- !
ing was heard all day yesterday in the direction of Modder â¦
River.
LONDON, Dec. 12, 4:40 a. m.
No further news has been re
ceived to remove the mystery
overhanging General Gatacre's
retreat from Stonnberg. He has
not yet forwarded the promised
additional message, and the cen
sorship has prevented the corre
spondents from explaining the
matter. Stormberg is described
as a stronger position than
Laings Xek. The only road
winds through lofty hills and
flanking is impossible. Coles
btirg is also said to be an almost
impregnable position and as no
troops are available to reinforce
the two columns acting in those
directions it becomes evident
that General Gatacre's misfortune
or error will delay the invasion of
the Free State perhaps some
weeks. It is exceedingly probable
that he will be compelled to retire
on Queenstown and to wait for
reinforcements, which can hardly
reach him until Sir Charles War
ren's division arrives at the Cape.
The first detachments will sail
Saturday next. Even if General
French is not compelled to re
treat he will be obliged to pause
in his advance.
It now seems certain that the
seventh division, which i< being
mobilized at Aldershot, will also
he sent to South Africa.
Xo news lias yet been received

capture of fifty prisoners at Mod
der River from Lord Methuen's

LONDON. Dec. 12.-What little In
formation reached London last
night from the seat of war con
tained nothing pertaining to the
advance of General Buller or Lord
Hethoen.
I v tails of General Catacr^'s d.fent
â how that his column was guided Into a
position where, they were at the mercy
of a heavy Boer Ore. Ignoranoa or treacn
ery on the part of the guides and neglect
of proper reeonnoissanoe precautions ire
responsible for this serious setback to the
British arms.
It Is not yet known at what stage the,
600 men were cut off. A? at Nicholsons
Neck, It Is assumed to be certain that
they continued to give a good acount of
themselves as long as their ammunition
held out.
The result of the reverse is that Gat
a^re's advance Is delayed, as Is also that
of General French from Naauwpoort.
Stormberg Is now known to hold a far
greater force than was supposed; en
eral Gatacre will require powerful rein
forcements before he can make another
essay. It remains to be teen whether the
Boers, emboldened by their success, will
venture south to try to cut Gatacre*s line
of communication.
Before another ten days have panned
transports bearing the fifth division,
which Is to be commanded by Sir
Charles Warren, will begin to arrive In
South African waters. It Is almost cer
tain some of the newcomers will be hur
ried up. to strengthen the hands of Gat
acre and French and protect Methucn'3
line of communication.
Experts here would not be surprised to
find that a considerable part of the Boers
who were investing Ladysmlth had been
called off and hurried down to the south
ern part of the Free State to bar the ap
proach of the British from Northern
Cape Colony. The extreme mobility of the
Boers has always been one of their chief
sources" of strength.
, â¢ General Boiler yesterday held a review
of troops at Frere Camp, probably as a
prelude to giving the order for an ad
vance. We are still without intelligence
of the fighting by Lord Methuens column
at Modder River, although it will be no
ticed, that the Boer telegram from Pre
toria states that General Cronje has sent
fifty prisoners to the Transvaal capital.

SENSATIONAL AFTERMATH
OF MERCENARY MARRIAGE
Unhappy Match of Adelbert Gale,
Brother of Mrs, Asa Fisk,
Bride and Groom of a Few Months Hurl
at Each Other Charges of Bigamy
and Blackmail.
AN order Issued yesterday by Judge
Daingcrneld granting the petition
of the defendant In the .suit of
Frankle Grant Gale against Adel
bert Orlando Gale for a change of
venue from San Francisco to Sonoma
County marks the beginning of a legal
contest which. If It reaches a final Issue,
will teem with sensational disclosures.
Frankie Gale is suing for an annulment
of her marriage to the defendant. She
alleges that her husband. Adelbert Or
lando. Is a bigamist. The husband, who
Is a brother of tho widow of the late Asa
Fisk. will contest the action on the
ground that his bride of but a few months
is an adventuress; that she married him
for the dollars Â»he thought he possessed,
and charged him with being â  bigamist to
cover up her own sins in the same line
and prevent possible prosecution In Den
ver. Colo. Incidentally there are hints of
blackmail and Insinuations that Frankle
< Irani Gale baa hopes of securing balm
for the alleged bhock to her affections
from the fortune that passed Into the
hands of her husband's ulster, Mrs. Fisk.
Through all the story of scandal and ro
mance that Is interwoven throughout the
suit of Gale vs. Gale the Kink, fortune
mmm to torn a prominent part.
The litigants had been married but
three moiling when tho wife played her
nrst card in what Is claimed to be a des
perate game of blackmaJl. The wedding,
wnlch occurred at trie Geysers, in Sonoma
County, was a pyroloehiucai affair. Scenes
were enacted mere wmch rival in baccha
nalian revelry the wildest occurrences at
the famous French ball, and in wnlch
many prominent, people drantc champagne
and kicked the globes on! the â¢tecino
lights, blue by slue with painted beauties
wnose borne addrvrfsea are in San Fran
cisco's tenderloin. Frank Jordan. County
Cierk or Alameda, was a prominent figure
In the ceremonlea. And the bride â well,
even her husband did not know v. no she
was or whence she came. lit- had known
her but time weeks. She had made vio
lent love to him. lie could not resist her
cnarms, and m the wedding iook place.
The husband llnds himself charged with
being a bigamist, and trie custodians of
the ri>k tortune are taking every pre
caution to prevent the woman they claim
to be an adventuress from getting any
part of their properly. - . *â 
loert Gale ana Oilman Gale, his
broiii. bacxed by their Bister's money,
were the lessees of the Geysers in Son
oma County. Adelbert is now running the
place all by himself as one of the results
ot the wedding, which has turned out so
disastrously, tor his brotner packed hiÂ«
vtilise- and left the day before the cere
mony and he, has never returned.
It was while the Gale brothers were en
gaged in extending the "glad hand" to
summer guests that a dashing young
woman arrived on the stage one nay In
the middle of last July ana registered as
Miss Frankle Grant of Denver, Colorado.
She was accompanied by Mrs. Argle,
Pearl Elkina and Marie Wone, three
women who subsequently played star en
gagements In Gale's matrimonial drama.
Mr. Gale's nephew, who also enjoyed the
festivities that attended the wedding,
says now that he did not know at the
time the character of the last-named trio
or he might not have allowed them to be
bridesmaid:) at ills uncle's nuptial and
might have objected to them kicking the
globes off the electric lights.
.Miss Grant of Denver cast loving
glances at Adelbert Gale the day after
she arrived at the Geysers. He was some
what shy at tho start, but within â  we*"k
she had won him and from that on until
a Methodist minister was brought up
from Cloverdale to make them man and
wife they were seldom out of each other's
company. Mrs. Argle. Pearl Klkins and
Marie W'one were close observers of the
love-making. They exchanged knowing
glances and held mysterious conversa
lions, while thÂ« rest of the guests at the
hotel looked upon the affair of Adelbert
Gale and Miss Grant of Denver as a sum
mer flirtation and nothing more, Groat
was the surprise when the loving couple
announced, after a throe weeks' flirtation,
that they were going to be married and
that they had nettled upon August 5 as
the date of the ceremony. Mrs. Asa Flsk
was at the hotel at the time and so was
her son. Arthur Flsk. They did not offer
mnln Boor position If not nt Spytfonteln. I
but at Magrrsfonteln. a point on the rail
way nearer M odder River. They ar- atâ¢ :
in force at Jacobsdaht, within the Free |
state border.
The sharp artillery duel between the
British howitzers and Boer puns on Satur
day ended in the latter being tempora
rily silenced, while the Boers did not reply
to the 4.7-inch naval gun.
For the moment the great turning of the
operations which had been going on in the
western Held stops. Lord Methuen. on
the extreme right, had been thrust for
ward to turn the Free Staters when they
would break toward Bloemfontein. As an
incident to the general plan to relieve
Klmberley, General French was creeping
up as a center line and occupied town
after town, conforming to Methuen a
movements.
At last the time came when the pivot of
the movement. General Gatacre's force,
should move forward. The strategic
necessity of seizing Btonnberg was ob
vious. It is the junction of the main line
from East London Into the Orange Free
State with the little branch line running
west, which, when the bridge recently de
stroyed and culverts have been repaired.
will give communication by rail between
Generals Gatacre and French. It was also
necessary to make a forward movement
on the center and right to keep the atten
tion of the Boer commanders, which
might otherwise fall upon Methuen's
weak line of communication.
Methuen has nearly accomplished his
share of the scheme. He has been suc
cessful at a great price In all his engage
ments. In all probability he has but one
more action at Spytfontein or Magcrsfon
tein before Klmberley will be relieved. He
Is more anxious about the long line of
communication behind him than the en
trenched position which he has sooner or
later to assault.
General French has had no great dlfn
i cultles in his way. He has advanced from
village to village v.ith the intention of
eventually occupying Colesburg and re
bounding into the Free State at Nocrahl
Point.
The first movement on General Gata
crc's part was to seize Stormberg if pos
| sible. This attempt has been defeated
and he has retired to Molteno. The effect
Of this on the future conduct of the cam
paign cannot be prophesied with any cer
tainty. General Gatacre will have to bo
I reinforced very strongly. General French
will have to pause in his advance. Lord
Methuen. once the final action for the re
lief of Klmberley is fought, â¢will have to
j turn his attention to the line of communi
| cation with De Aar.

In the disaffected portion of CapÂ« Colony,
they cannot be accused of unseemly exul

Most of the journals see In the defeat
an undoubted trap laid by Boers working
In conjunction with Dutch traitors. ThÂ«

opinion, raying that Sir Alfred Mllner has
threatened In vain to overwhelm the dis
loyal Dutch with tho thunderbolts of Brit

than loyalty. It sees In the attitude of
the Afrikanders the inevitable result of
the tactless language of the British press

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN. Dec. 11.â The Reichstag pre- |
seated a highly Impressive spectacle to
day during the debate on the estimate*
ri,' tlie formal introduction of Emperor
William's new naval programme. En the
court box sat Prince Radziwill, with In- 1
structions to make a personal report to
the Kaiser. The Bundesrath's table was
crowded. !
Count yon Bulow, when announcing
the Samoan settlement, was repeatedly
interrupted by applause His second
speech, dealing 1 with the necessity â¢ for a i
large fleet, provoked approval and dis
approval almost equally emphatic. The
disapproval came from the Radicals.
When he declared that Germany did not
desire to pursue an aggressive pyrotech
nlc/U course, but was equally determined '
not to be pushed aside politically or com
mercially by other powers and never to
allow an important international ques
tion to be settled without consulting her,
there was an outbreaK of spontaneous ap
plause.
Prince Hohenlohe, whose weak ' voice
was scarcely audible; Admiral Tirpltz and
Huron yon Thlennann were beard. The
session was brief, because the Mouse de
sired to Â«<â¢<â  the speeches In print before
considering the proposals. Admiral Tlr
pltz made a number of technical state
ments in explanation of the Govern
ment's changed opinion. The opposition,
which is apparently stronger than had
been expected, was . ifounded by tne
vigorous, joint Government onslaught. I
After the adjournment It was said In the
lobby the Emperor had given strict 'or
ders for the dissolution ot the Reichstag
should the Cabinet consider it unlikely
that the bill would pass.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press this evening obtained confirmation
of this report in high quarters. Emperor
William is confident that the proposal to
Increase the strength of the navy is popu
lar with the electorate, and he believe*
thai the new Reichstag would probably
1 (fleet this sentiment in other national
alms, more accurately.
Count yon Bulow, the Minister of For
eign Affairs, reiterated the terms of the
various agreements for partitioning
Samoa between the United States . and
drrmany, for repeating the S.imnan act.
find for submitting to arbitration the
losses resulting from unjustlnoble mili
tary action on the part of officers be
longing to either of the three state*. 1IÂ« I
said that after the assent of the United
States and the Bundesrath bills ratifying
the treaty would bo submitted. In the ,
meantime he hoped the Reichstag would
not discuss the matter. He added that no
Increase In next year's Imperial budget
would arise from the supplemental esti
mates of Samoa.
Prince Hohenlohe. the Imperial Chan
cellor, announced that the federated gov
ernments had come to the conclusion that
the present navy was insufficient for the |
country's needs, and that estimate* for
doubling the present number <â¢! warships i
would be submitted. He added that the ;
period within which the increase of the !
new navy would be affected was not fixed
by law, the number of new ships to be
provided, for. annually In the estimates
being decided In accordance with budget
ary requirements.
'In this matter." he continued.- "the
federated- governments are acting on the
supposition that In accordance with th
general principles governing the financing
of estimates the additional vessels will
be paid for by loans."
Count yon Bulow, In supporting the
proposed Increase In the navy paid:
The rr*Â«MÂ»nt of the United States In hi*

cerned *Â»â¢ are willing and ready to* live In
pÂ»Â«'-Â« anil concord with her on the basis .if
full reciprocity and reciprocal consideration.
Count yon Bulow justified the Increase
in the navy from a political point of view
and declared that the German policy had
always maintained an even course be
tween neglecting and overdoing trans
oceanic Interests. Alluding to the .war
like changes and revolutions of the past
few years he said:
I cannot yet believe a new partition of the
earth Is Imminent. We wish to Interfere with
no foreign power, but neither do. we wish to
let ourselves be piiÂ«h*d aside either politically
or economically. We cannot be but mixed up
with the future, th" prospects of which havo
been considerably modified the last few years
because we have Interest* In all part* of the .

We rniin be assured against surprise not only
on land, but at eea. We must create and pos
sess a fleet strong; enough to exclude attack
by any powerâ I emphasize attack, for In
the nhÂ«olute oeacefulnesa of our policy It ran
never be ' other than a. question of defense.
German foreign policy Is neither covetous,
restless nor fanciful. The fanclfulness of our
plan* Is thÂ« Invention of the foreljm press and
not sanctioned by the German press or oftl
clally. Like all nations with maritime Inter
ests we are compelled by necessity to have
real supplies and obtain naval bases. This
manifested Itself In the Hlspano-Amerlcan
war. -'which taught tin many striking lessÂ»riM.
While pursuing this practical policy toward
our transoceanic colonies, we must not foriet
that our center Is Europe. We do not nerlect
our duty In providing security for our posses
sions which rests on thÂ» Drelbund.
As nn Instance of the necessity of a
navy Count yon Bulow cited the present
conditions In Venezuela, where, he said,
"very considerable German Interests are
periously Jeopardized, and to which coun
try we are able to send two or three old
training ships." â¢ .
Continuing, Count yon Bulow said: In
the coming century the German people
must be either the hammer or the anvil.
In the name of the country's best inter
est I entreat your favorable reception of
the naval bill." : 11

OUTLOOK IS GLOOMY
FOR SENATOR QUAY
Apathy of His Friends Makes the
Chance That He Will Be Seated
Decidedly Uncertain.
WASHINGTON. Deo. 11â Th* apathy
among Senator Quay"? friend* Ih making
the outlook in the Senate rather omlnoim
for him. It Is noticeable that there iÂ« a
lurk of antbasUuÃÃ upon the part of those
from whom moot was expected by Mr.
Quay. Senators Chandler and Penrose
appear to be the only one* who are doing
any active canvassing in his behalf, and
they arc by no means encouraged by the
progress they are makings
The lack of Interest' was forcibly Illus
trated In the case of a Senator who was
approached to-day with the suggestion
that he make a stroni? speech in behalf of
the constitutional right of â  Governor to
appoint when the Legislature had failed
to elect. This Senator had spoken In be- ;
hall of. Senator Corbett ann wu urged !
to-nay to repeat the same arguments that
he advanced in that. gentleman's behalf.
The Senator referred to Is considered one
of the best constitutional lawyers in the.
Senate, and there is no doubt that a
speech from him in the Interest of Mr.
Quay would have considerable effect. But
he has declined the request on the ground
that when he supported Mr. Corbett both
Senators . Quay and Pen rose refused to
vote to peat him. The Senator stated
that he would vote to seat Mr. Quay, but
ho did not see how the Pennsylvania Sen
ator could consistently Insist upon his
taking charge of the case on the floor of
the Senate.
It Is becoming more manifest every day
that Mr. Quay has considerable canvass
ing to do to make his seat in the Senate
a certainty. There are too many names
on the non-committal column to make the
outcome certain for him at this time. Mr.
Quay is expected here on Wednesday,
when it may be expected that he will put
In hir "best licks 1 for himself. One of !
the plans his friends are talking about Is
to Induce a sufficient number of Mr.
nay Democratic friends to assert
themselves on the day when the final vote
Is taken, and this may insure a majority
vote in his favor. â¢

Xnen persisted In their efforts that the
1â remaining bodies might be rescued

It waÂ« expected that by noon to-day the
rolaÂ« would be cleared of gas so that the
cause of the explosion might be ascer
tained iuiii the blame. If any exist*,
placed on the right shoulders. Twloe
vo: kerÂ» got wittilu a fÂ« w feet of thÂ«
fang-way, aj.d each time they were
driven out by 'encountering unexpected
bodies ol gas. It Is believed that by mid
night the air circuit will be complete. If
this should be the case the coroner's Jury
will be given light on the subject to-mor
row.
Sheriff Mills arrived this evening from
Tacon:a. accompanied by George Mac

Scully* 3 r red Eldenmlller. A. E. Lawrence
a::d J. F. C. Johnson, who will comprise

went to Tacoma to secure the Jurors at
the request of Coroner Hoska, who be
lieves It to be impossible to secure an en
tirely Impartial jury here.
The theory is gu.lr.iiig ground to-day
that the explosion was caused by an un
duly heavy bla.-t of giant-powder used
by contract miners In toping Efforts
wÂ« re being made latÂ«\ly under orders from
6a.:: Francisco to Increase the mine's out
put. Hesldes this incentive, contract
miners are always anxious to use as
much dynamite as possible, they being
fa:d by the cubic yard. Superintendent
>avles state* that considerable dyna
mite has been u*ed lately. Follow
lr< heavy blasts it frequently hap
pens that a seam full of gas will
be opened up nr.d gas soon p^r
meate* the entire mine. This causes dust
to rise, which was especially true In mine
No. 7. the di-yest mine at Carbonado. In
that case the le-aM concussion caused by
a blast may start a general explosion. It
Is also the opinion of Lewis Davles,
brother of the superintendent, thai the
explosion was started by an unusually
larce blast of dynamite In the stopes.
Many miners are gathered In the hos
pital :o-nlÂ«rht discussing the accident and
Its results. All acree that the saddest
part of the catastrophe is the desolation
of thirty-two homes and the fact that the
dÂ«>a'i mer.'s families are very poorly pro

miners here can scarcely make both ends
meet from one month to another. The
wages paid are less than during the good
times of eight years ago. Contract prices
have also been cut until It becomes very
uncertain whether men taking contracts
and working doubly hard will earn even
fair wages. Of course there are mo
lucky ones who always do well, but moat
miner* consider themselves well off If
they receive as much as $52 per month or
the equivalent of a full month at $2 per
day. The company provides no medical
or hospital service for tiM men. but they
have themselves Incorporated the Medical
Association of Carbon Hill Colliery, which
has $!*.Â»â Â» In Its treasury. Membership Is
not compulsory, but most of the miners
pay 50 cents per month and secure Its
sick benefits. This association is caring
for the men who were Injured on Satur
day. Complaint Is also made that numer
ous Poles and Finns live In crowded bunk
houses where the air Is stifling and the
quality of food very poor.
A -relief committee was organized here

These thirty-one miners have left a score or
more of bereaved families and raddened homes.
ThÂ» comlnr Chrlstmns will be a sorrowful one
for Carbonado. The result of the nwlft catas
trophe of Paturday Is that sixteen widows,
forty-flr* children, six Â»_ce<l parents and de
pendents, making sixty-seven dependents, ars
altogether deprived of a source of support. In
one case an aeed lather and mother lose their
two sens, their only means of support. In an
other a promising young man leaves behind
a widowed mother, almost destitute, and now
rendered completely childless. One family
mourns the loÂ«s of a husband and a son. A
youtur woman In delicate condition, married
on!y a short time art>. will soon become a
mother, without a husband to provide sus

Is the distressful misfortune of another wo

rather large families of children to strurifle

â  These, are the Inevitable consequences of the
accident, the cause of which Is unknown. Fate
has blotted from the book of the living- thÂ»

question that the wages of the organized work

the hours of labor either reduced or. at least

Practically, the only advantage which has

revival has been longer hours of dally labor
with additional burdens to bear.
Reviewing the events of the past year

declared that from the bent sources avail

property of the Bunker Hill and Sullivan
mines was the act of unorganized miners.
Of the corraling of 1200 miners by the
State authorities, aided by General Mer
riam, he said:
I The whole preceding Is so outrageous as to
I bring a blurh of shame to the cheeks of every

WASHINGTON. Dec. 11. -The feature of
the opening day of the debate on the
currency bill In the House was the speech
of Dolliver of lowa. It was character
ized by all the wit and eloquence for
which the lowan Is noted, and held the
members, without regard to party, for
m >re than an hour. Dolliver declared
that the last doubt In the Republican
party as to the wisdom of enacting the
?>>ld standard Into law had been removed
by tho experience of the business world
during the part three years. He scored
Bryan and generally ridiculed the false
prophecies of the Democrats in 189*.
1 >c Armond of Missouri was the heavy
gun on the Democratic side. He warned
the Republicans from the West that they
j could not deceive their constituents in the
ccimlng; Congressional elections by claim-
ing that they had yielded to the wisdom
of their colleagues in caucus.
Over-street of Indiana opened the debate
in support of the bill and Maddox of
Georgia replied to him. McClellan of New
York was the only other speaker to-day,
lie announced his opposition to the bill on
the ground that it would contract the
currency, extinguish the bank notes and
enhance the value of coin bondÂ». He ap
pealed to those of his Democratic col
leagues from New York who It is reported
intend to vote for the bill not to do so.
Immediately after the reading of the
Journal the House, under the special or
der, went Into committee of trie whole,
Hepburn of lowa In the chair, and entered
upon the consideration of the bill. Over-
Ftreet of Indiana, who Is to be in charge
of the measure on the floor, opened the
general debate with a set speech. Said he:
If the legal standard -day Is the (old stand
ard under the act of 1873. a positive statute to
that effect can do no harm. If, on the other
hand, I turn Is, any reasonable doubt, It should
be dispelled by a statute plain and clear In Its
terms.
When certainty shall take the place of doubt
and the Integrity of our credit be as fixed as
the honor of the nation, the national debt can
be readily refunded at lower Interest rates and
future loans negotiated with ease upon better
terms than ever before.
Recent events, shaped by causes beyond our
control, bearing obligations which national
honor requires shall be courageously discharged.
open new fields for American statesmanship.
Channels of trade yet unknown to American
enterprise, and avenues of commerce yet to
welcome American products, will surely result.
Such conditions emphasize the necessity for a
standard of value which shall remain firm
throughout the vicissitudes of competitive
trade.
After an elaborate exposition of the fea
tures of the bill and the method of their
operation, which followed the line of his
report on the measure heretofore printed,
Overstreet said:
The proposition to allow national bank* to
issue circulation to the par value of the bonds
deposited for their security. is neither new nor
partisan. It has been recommended by four
Presidents and live Secretaries of the Treasury,
and bills containing such provisions have been
Introduced In Congress and supported by mem
ben of both political parties. It Is entirely con
sistent with the present banking system. '
Shafroth (811. R.) of Colorado Inter
rupted to ask If the bill would not result
in contracting the currency to the ex
tent of the J480.000.000 in silver Im
pounded.
"It would not." replied Overstree.t, "be
cause for every sliver dollar which. goes
into the treasury a gold dollar will go
out in circulation." (Republican ap
plause.)
Maddox (D.) of Georgia was the first
speaker In opposition to the bill. Re
ferring to former Speaker Rer<l> New

actment of gold standard legislation be

away from the Republican party, he
â ala:
"The faithful understand that this legis
lation must be enacted at once or not at
all."
The enactment of gold standard legisla
tion, he declared, had never been an Issue
before the people. If gold waa now the
â¢existing standard," as contended. It
wa* so ny the unlawful usurpation of
the executive officers of the Government
The treasury, under the bill, he predicted
would be raided. The bill would convert
every obligation of the treasury into a
gold obligation and would impel the Gov
ernment to sell millions of gold to the
amount of 25 per cent of all the outstand
ing notes of whatever character. He
urged that, under the bill, banks with
$1,000,000 capital, now required to deposit
bonds equal to a third of their capital In
the treasury, were required to deposit
only $60,000 In bonds, enabling them to
contract or expand the currency at will
He then assailed Republican advocates of
the gold standard for apostasy, and par
ticularly attacked Hepburn of lowa
Dlnglev of Maine and Grosvenor of
Ohio. who. he said, advocated silver coin
age by International agreement In 1597
Dolllver of. lowa read from the speech
of Governor Altgeld to the effect that
the Republican Congress would obey or
ders and enact gold legislation. ' For
himself, he said, he was proud to say that
he was obeying ordersâ the orders of the
people of his districtâ trying to put the
laws of the country Into harmony with
their opinions. The pending bill "was a
compromise, representing the united wis
dom of all: It was a- bill to sot at rest all
doubt as to the standard In this country-
It should be presented to the business
men of the country as a Christmas gift
He (Dolllver) did not want his record and
past follies to be brought up against him.
He had voted for the Sherman act In IRK)
an act which he now regarded as a piece
I of unutterable stupidity. In 1893. when tho
[ act came to be repealed. Dolliver said
he was very much perplexed. He saw
Senator Sherman one evening sitting out
side his house like Abraham outside his
tent.
"Don't trouble yourself about the fail
ure of your predictions regarding silver "
said the Senator: "every prophecy I made
about It has turned out exactly the op
posite." (Laughter.)
"Just as yours will now," Interjected
Cox of Tennessee amid renewed laughter
Continuing. Dolllver Bald that he be
lieved the result of the campaign of 1*96
pÂ»ttle.d th* silver issue. A proposition
which received a black eye In lowa and
Massachusetts at the same time. In his
opinion had no future In the Intellectual
life of the American people. In 1896 the
cry of Bryan, he Bald, was for more
money. Money was . scarce. It was
hoarded. The day after the election It
came out from Its hiding.
"Are you willing now," Interrupted
Slmms of Tennessee, "that the mints
should be opened to silver If an Interna
tional agreement, could bo obtained?"
"No. sir.'" replied Dolllver. "I have
made my last whirl with silver. I have
been humbugged for the last time."
Dolllver said that the cry had been for
more money. -In three years of Republi
can administration $400,000,000 had been
added to the volume of the currency
more money than could have been coin
ed by the mints in ten yean* if the mint*
bad been opened to silver. . . ;
"In .other words." Bald he. "we have
done for you in three yearn more, tbÂ«n
you could do: for yourselves. Why don't
you get out of the road and let the main
procession move on?" (Laughter and up.
plause.)
Dolllver recalled Bryan's prophecy that
the gold standard could not be enact
without a universal fall of prices. -
"la there a man In this chamber," ne
asked, "who will rise In his place and
cay that Mr, Bryan knew what he was
! talking about?"
Not a Democrat arose. Dolllver paused.
I reiterated his question and then resumed:
"It is then confessed that In a question i
which goes to the heart of the contro
versy Mr. Bryan lacked wisdom."
He called attention to Bryan's predlc- ,
tlon that wages would fall and men would !
be- thrown out of employment. Yet at the
end of three years of Republican adminis
tration under the gold standard there was
not an industrious man in the country
without employment. Those three years,
said he, had removed the last fears of
the Republicans as to the wisdom of
enacting gold legislation. It could not
have been done two years or one year
ago, but to-day the unanimous voice of
the Republican party was backed up by
the experience of the business world.
McClellan of New York opposed the bill.
"I do not wish it understood." said he,
"that 1 advocate the present system of
bank note currency. Tho first direct con
sequence of the enactment of this bill
will be a very groat rise in the market
price of Government bonds. Its enact
ment also would result In the extinction
of the present bank note currency."
He argued that the impounding of the
treasury notes and the I'nltea Btates
notes in the terms of the bill would result
in a contraction of the currency amount
ing to over $265,000,000 and require an issue
of bonds to that amount, at an additional
cost of 18.000.000 or a total contraction of I
the currency of nearly $510,000,000 and a
reduction or the per capita to $19 20. In
conclusion he appealed to the sound
money Democrats in the House not to
vote for the bill.
De Armond of Missouri followed in op
position to the bill. Replying to Dolliver.
he said the Democrats had not been over
borne in R% In tho conflict of reason, but
the Republican party had won by sum
moning to their aid the corrupt and tre
mendous power of money and corpora
tions. He charged the Republicans with
docelving the people in ISW. They were
bimotalli?ts then. If they were honest
then thoy must ho dishonest now: if hon- j
cst nÂ«w. dishonest then. The change of |
the bÂ«nds from coin to gold bonds, he |
said, would make a free gift of $100,000,000 i
to tho bondholders. The bill would ere- I
ato a bank trust. Ho predicted that this j
measure would overwhelmingly defeat the !
Republican party in 1900. When the peo- !
filos victory was won next fall, said he
n conclusion, it must not bÂ« necessary to
go to tho "vine-clad cottage" at Canton.
Ohio, to offer congratulations, but "be
yond tho Mississippi to that modest home
il Lincoln. Xehr.. whorÂ« resides that great
and stanch friend of the people." (Dem
ocratic applause.)
Groene of Pennsylvania then announced
tho death of his colloaguo. the late Rep- 'â 
resentatlve Errr.cntrout of Pennsylvania, i
and at 5:f6 o'clock, as a further mark of j
respect, the BOOM adjourned.

"WASHINGTON. Dec. 11.â Senator Mor
gan of Alabama has Introduced a Joint
resolution to prohibit combinations be
tween corporations to control interstate
commerce and transportation. The reso- !
lution is as follows:
That any contract, agreement or combination
between two or more corporations which has for !
Its purpose the control of thÂ« price of anything i
which Is the subject of. or enters Into, inter
state commerce, or the cost of the transpor- '
tation thereof, so as to Increase the same at
any place or locality In the United States, or
to discriminate in favor of or against any mass ,
of dealers, traders or consumers of such arti- '

Mr. 'Morgan pave notice of his Intention

SHIPMENTS IN BOND.
Bill to Extend the Privilege Regard
less of Destination.
"WASHINGTON. Dec. 11.âRepresenta
tive Payne of New York, prospective
chairman of the Ways and Means Com
mittee, to-day Introduced a bill extending
the privilege of shipping merchandise in
bond across the country without refer
ence to the destination of the goods. At
present this free bonding privilege Is re
stricted to goods going to the adjacent
territory of t'anada or Mexico.
Payne says thÂ«Â» effect of this has been
to cut off transcontinental traffic In
goods destined for remote points In Asia
and elsewhere, which traffic was taken by
the Canadian railroads. His hill seeks to
open the privileges to all MUBtrlai alike,
on the same terms that Canada and Mex
ico have enjoyed, and Payne says It Is
distinctly favorable to American trans
portation interests
The bill does not change the status
relative to the Mexican free zone, that
portion of the bill being a repetition of
the present law.
Bill Aimed at Trusts.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 11. -Senator Chll
ton to-day introduced a bill prohibiting
the sending of articles, the making of
which Is controlled by a trust, from one
State to another. Such offenses are made
punishable by Imprisonment not to exceed
three years.

TRIP TO UTAH
MUST BE MADE
Probable Action in the
Roberts Case.
Â»
BpÂ«cU! DUpatch to Tke Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. ll.âRepresenta
tive J.onlz probably will fail In his effort.-*
to have the House of Representatives di
rect the special committee Investigating
the Roberts casÂ« to inquire Into the
charges of polygamy against Postmaster
Graham at Provo and Postmaster
Smith at Logan. Members of this
committee with whom I talked take
the ground that they have enough
work before them In the Roberts In
quiry, and that. If any investigation is to
be mad* in the charges against the Post
masters It should be made by the Post
offlce Department rather than by a Con
gressional committee.
In the absence of Chairman Tayler from
Washington there was no meeting of the
Roberts Committee to-day, but members
of the committee discussed among them
selves the question whether It would be
necessary for them to go to Utah to con
duct the Investigation. The reasons for
going to the neighborhood where all the
witnesses live are so strong that It In
probable that wbon the committee meets
to-morrow morning It will be decided that
the trip to Utah must be made.
Petitions against the seating of Rob
erts and In favor of an anti-polygamy
amendment to the constitution continue
to pour Into both houses of Congress by
thousands. They come from all parts of
the country an.l they constitute a laree
part of the mall of nearly every Sena
tor and Representative. They are all pre
sented In the two houses and referred to
appropriate committees.
So many members of both houses are
becoming Interested in the proposition to
amend the constitution so an to prohibit
polygamy in the Lnited States for all
lime that there Is every reason to expect
the passage of a resolution before the
expiration of. the present session of Con-
Representative Bhowalter of Pennsyl
vania introduced In the House to-day an
anti-polygamy measure similar to so
many others that have been Introduced.
MASON APPEALS
FOR THE BOERS
Scathing Arraignment of
England.
DENOUNCED AS A BULLY
IMPASSIONED SPEECH IN THE
SENATE.
Advocating His Resolution of Sym
pathy, the Illinoisan Dubs Cham
berlain a Lilliputian
Statesman.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.-An appeal by
Mason of Illinois for the expression of
sympathy for the Transvaal republic In
Its war with Great Britain was the feat
ure of the Senate proceedings to-day. It
was the first formal address delivered In
the Senate this session and was listened
to with thoughtful attention by both the
members and by a large gallery of audi
tors. The resolution upon which Mason
based his speech was referred, at the con
clusion of the address, to the Foreign Re
lations Committee, Lodge of Massachu
setts considering it too delicate a ques
tion. In view of the position of this Gov
ernment, to pass upon without serious
consideration.
While Mason's address at times was
vehementâ almost passionateâ he confined
himself during a greater part of the time
closely to his manuscript, speaking at all
times with force and vigor. In opening
he said:
The war between monarchy and republican-
Ism began In earnest on July 4, 177*. and no
treaty of pear* haj ever been concluded, imr
ever will be, until the question Is nettled right.
The monarchlal trust company, though often
quarreling among themselves, have always
arreed on one thing; that a republic It a mls
takÂ».
After quoting extensively from Daniel
Webster's speech in support of his posi
tion. Mason continued:
But we are told that Kngland wu our friend
in the war with .Spain. How? Her people wrn
our friends because her people are a Christian
people; her government has never been our
friend except for purposes of Its own. I have
no desire to twist the lion's tall, but truth com
pels the statement. So far as our interests arÂ«
concerned, for the last half century the g.,v-'
ernment of Kngland and the people of Kngtand
have been divided. YrÂ»<i remember 1S61? The
government did all It could to divide the Union,
but the brave, starving wavers refused to re
solve a*ralnÂ«t us. saying they would starve be
fore tJiey would oay a word for slavery.
But even suppose she were to-day our best
friend, are we to be silent and uphold a wrong
In consideration of that friendship? We Re
publicans nre charged with a secret alliance
with England. It cannot bÂ« true ar.'l the vote
which this or a similar resolution receives will
answer the charge.
Mason maintained that under the Mon
roe doctrine and on precedents previously
well established, the T'nltod States had
the same ri?ht to extend it* sympathy
and hopes for success to the Boers in
their struggle for liberty as it had to in
terfere wltn Spain in its conduct of af
fairs in Cuba. Ha urged that the Interest
of this country was aroused by the fact
thnt the South African war was a strug
gle between democracy and royaltyâbe
tween the divine right of kings and the
divine right of man. He exclaimed:
If we should sp*ak. and apeak quickly. It
would sting the politicians who brought on the
war for greed of gold and cheer the poor, brave
Ihitch defender of his home.
Mason contended that the question In
volved in the controversy between Great
Britain and the Transvaal prior to.hos
tilities was simply one of supremacy In
South Africa. "And I ask." said he. "In
common Justice, what right has Great
Britain to be supreme In South Africa?
It Is a light to control South Africa, and
the only way the English could do was to
threaten, bulldoze, browbeat and Interfere
with the Dutchmen until out of sheer
humiliation and desperation he was driven
to fight.
Referring to Mr. Chamberlain, he said:
Lat the distinguished Lilliputian statesman,
rattling around In Gladstone's shoes, trying to
undo his work and break his promises, be as
sured that he Is deceiving no one except, possi
bly, himself.
He declared that no nation except a pro
fessed bully would make the demands
upon another that Great Britain made
upon the TransvaaJ Republic, and In
closing said:
I bare not sought to excite prejudice by our
past differences with Enrlond. They are for
gotten and forgiven. But when the colors of a
republic are struck and we sit silent. It would
seem that we are ashamed or tired of our In
stitutions and by our silence give consent to
the destruction of self-government In Africa.
The statue of Liberty Enlightening the World
in New Tork harbor is neither a myth, a no
tion nor a lie. We may say without boasting
that If self-government Is right we have helped
the world. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
If I am right, this resolution will help. It
will say to the world: "Washington. Monroe
and Webster are d*ad. but the American policy
still lives" It may sting the oppressor, but It
will be a message of affection and hop* to the
struggling republic.
Mason addressed the Senate for an hour
and twenty-five minutes. He was not
once Interrupted In the course of his
speech.
At Its conclusion. Lodge, after ex prais
ing the wish that Mason might have de
livered his address In the British Parlia
ment, said there was a wide gulf between
private opinion and public official expres
sion. The executive department of the
Government, he said, had assumed a neu
tral attitude toward the South African
war. The passage of this resolution by
the Senate would change immediately
that attitude.
"If we nre to depart from the position
of neutrality," paid Lodge. "It ought to
be a subject of most serious considera
tion."
He moved therefore that the resolution
be sent to the Committee on Foreign Re
lations, and It was so ordered.
At 3:06 o'clock the Senate went Into ex
ecutive session, adjourning at 3:40.

What May Happen.
Weal^ Kidneys Caused by Over-
work, by LiftiQg or a Strain.
1 illM fPBSPP !^
We do not always know the constant
danger that confronts us through all
the daily walks of life. It may be an
accident or sudden illness; or perhaps
a disease that has been stealing upon
us from day to day.
It used to be considered that only
urinary troubles were to be traced to
the kidneys, but now modern science
proves that nearly all diseases have
their beginning In the disorder of these
most important organs.
Now by this Is not meant that you
should overlook all the other organs
and merely look after the kidneys.
Your other organs may need atten-
â  tlonâ but your kidneys most, because
they do most.
If you are sick do not neglect your
kidneys, because as soon as they are
well they will help all the other organs
to health.
The kidneys may get weak or dis-
eased from a thousand and one causes;
from overwork, worry, a simple cold,
from lifting, a strain, or excess in high
living.
Others may suffer from diabetes,
dropsy, swelling of the feet and ankles,
rheumatism, bad blood, gout, gravel,
catarrh of the bladder, sleeplessness]
anaemia, nervousness, headache or
neuralgia.
All these symptoms are due to kidney
trouble, and the most prompt and ef-
fectual cure Is Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney remedy.

BOUND FOR WASHINGTON
TO LOBBY FOR HAWAII
COLONEL O. L. LITTLE OF HILO
NOW AT THE PALACE.
Chosen to Represent the Anti-Dole
Party in Their Fight for Ter
ritorial Government.
Among the distinguished passengers
who arrived yesterday from the Inlands Is
Colonel IS. 1. Little, now nt the Palaco
HoteL Colonel Little Is â â â¢â¢â¢ of Ullo
and Is on his way to Washington to look
after tin- Interests of the American party
In the Hawaiian Islands during th pas
sage through Congress of the Hawaiian
bill.
When seen last evening Colonel Little
said that m.Â« a resident of the islands he
had the Interests of the people very much
at heart, and as an attorney who under
stood the technicalities of legislation he
had been delegated by those known as the.
American party, or. In other words, tho*e
opposed to the Dole administration, to go
to Washington and do his best to rush
the passage of the bill through Congress.
The bill as It now stands Is not, so says
the colonel, entirely satisfactory to the
majority of the people In the Islands. In
consequence several amendments will be
asked for. and It Is aspect**] they will be
granted.
The principal of these pertain to cltl
senshlp and the land laws. It will be
asked that all those residing In the Ha
waiian Islands at the time, of the over
throw of the monarchy be considered cltl
rens upon taking the prescribed oath;
also those having established a residence
of one year.
The land law!Â«. It Is claimed, give too
much authority to the land agent and al
low too much latitude for discrimination.
TheÂ« Congress will be asked to eliminate
and to substitute the regular land laws of
the United States Instead.
Congress will alao be asked to Insert a
clause declaring all the commission* va
cant upon the passage of the bill and thus
give the people an opportunity to express
their wishes as to future "facials. The
only man they have seriously In mind .it
present Is Arthur M. SewaJl. whom they
wish to make Governor. There are many
other amendments looktng to the secur
ing for the people of the Hawaiian Isl
ands the same form of government en
joyed by the Territories of the United
States.
Senator Culloai will introduce the hill.
which will be referral to a committee.

DIED ON THE WAY
TO THE HOSPITAL
Miss Lizzie Granfleld Passes Away
Under Rather Peculiar
Circumstances.
T'lzzlo Oraaileld, an employe, of Green
baum Brother*, died In the ambulance
while being conveyed to the Receiving
Hospital. Tho peculiar circumstances
surrounding her death led to an Investi
gation by the polio* and the detention for
a few hours of Dr. Marion Thrasher.
Detectives Ed Gibson and Charles
Coady were immediately placed on thÂ«
case by Captain Bohen and In a short
time learned that Miss Qranflcld visited
the oflices of Dr. Thrasher in the Donohoe
building shortly after the noon hour and
complained of being 111. She was placed
on the lounge and was* administered to by
the doctor. As she. continued to grow
worse Dr. Winslow Anderson, who has ad
joining oflices. was called In and nitro
glycenn and strychnine wore adminis
tered to her hypodermlcally. Mi.Â»> Gran
rWld'a condition grew critical and Dr.
Thrasher telephoned to thÂ« Receiving
Hospital for the. ambulance and handed
his patient over to Steward Davis and the
young lady was hurried to the hospital,
but in* passed away before arriving at
her destination. . _, ,
Dr. Thrasher was escorted to the Chief
of Police's otnee last night and stated
that he had been the family's physician
for over sixteen years; that Miss Uran
lleld's death was due to heart failure and
gastritus. H. explained his action in
sending his patient away from his office
at a critical period by saying that he
thought she would be more comfortable
nt hi home, and he rang for the ambu
lance to have her conveyed to Ml Minna
street.
Miss Granfleld's body was removed to
the Morgue. Her sister stated that she
was affected with a weak heart, which Is
hereditary In her family. hÂ«r parent* hav

BONDS STOLEN FROM
FILES OF RECORDER
OTHER PAPERS REQUIRED IN
SUIT MISSING.
Protection Afforded for the Records
Concerning the Builders Is
Found to Be Entirely
Unsatisfactory.
On the Cth of October. Il**,I I **, a contract
was filed at the office of the County Re
corder In this city for the building of
flats on Olive avenue, near Van Ness ave
nue, by J. V. Hull M contractor, for Jo
seph Henry, the owner of the land. The
cost was to be $2250. The bondsmen named
In the bond, which was filed. at the same
time along with the plans and upeoitlca
tlons. wore Matthew Harris and Prank
Harris, 'who are connected with a lum
ber concern at the corner of Fifth md
Brannan streets. There were some bill*
that the contractor did not pay in fu l.
By reason of this a Market street busi
ness house, which furnished some of the
builder's hardware for the flats, recent
ly looked pbout with the Idea of bringing
suit against the bondsmen. An attorney
was sent to the Recorder's ofllce to look
up the papers on file. To his icreat sur
prise he found that all the four papers
in the caseâ the bond, plans, specifications
and contract had disappeared.
A deputy of Recorder Hcrthler looked In
all the pigeon holes where such papers
are Wed away and also in a large safe,
wherein bonds are put In case a lien Is
filed. After careful search the announce
ment was made that tho papers were all
gone and that they had been probably
stolen.
It appears that there Is very little, if
any. security for bonds under the pres
ent arrangement. Under the law builders'
contracts are not recorded. The file In
each case :s simply tucked into a pigeon
hole to remain until It Is called for. \\ htle
no person Is supposed to take a file from
any pigeon hole the papers are often left
for the parson Inspecting them to look tit,
and often he is alone. There have been
other losses of bonds In builders' contracts
reported, but this Is the first time re
cently that an entire file In any case has
disappeared.
The statement was made in the office
of the Recorder by an ofllce deputy that
the builders' contracts and papers of that
sort were not even pigeon-holed before
the present administration came Into of
fice and fiat there were huddled together
bonds and contracts separated by years
as far apart as I*so and IS9S. There are
valuable looks In the upper part of the
Recorder ofnee that are on the floor by
reason of lack of any proper place to put
them. One business house reported yes
terday that on two separate occasions the
bonds of builders, to which the proprie
tors had looked for Indemnity, were miss-
Ing from the Recorder's office and could
not be found after a long search. Pre
sumably they were stolen.

SAN JOSE. Doc. âFruit growers from
all over the State arrived In Ban Jose by
to-day's train to participate In the twen
ty-fourth annual State Fruit Grovers*
Convention, which convenes in the Uni
tarian church to-morrow morning. About
two hundred visitors are here to-night,
and matters relating to the tree and vine
industries are almost the sole topic of
conversation in the hotel corridors. The
convention will be under the auspices of
the Slate Board of Horticulture. Presi
dent Elwood Cooper will be in the chair.
The other members of the State board
who will take part in the convention are:
Frank H. Buck, vice president. Vacavllle.

A. Block. Santa Clara. Commissioner for
the San Francisco district.
Every section of California will be rep
resented. Besides those already here over
i two hundred more arc expected to-mor
, row morning, which will make a conven
tion of at least live hundred. Conditions
which have arisen during the past year
make organization among the growers Im
perative, and preat Interest has been
aroused unons the growers of declduoua
, and citrus fruits. A delegation of thirty,
headed by A. H. Naftzger. president of
the Southern California Fruit Exchange,
will represent Lot Angeles.
President Cooper's annual address to
morrow morning will include many sug
gestions as to organization. Some radical
changes are looked for.
The matter of transportation will be
, gone Into thoroughly. Los Angeles grow
ers. It is said, Â»ire going to lead the fight
against the railroad. The raising of car
load lots from 15,000 pounds to 26.000
pounds by the railroads has worked a
hardship "on the small growers. Besides,
it is h>M that the packing of fruit so
closely Is injurious in the long overland
' hauls necessary to reach the Eastern
markets. The big refrigerator cars are
built to hold 40.000 pounds, and many
growers fear the railroads will keep on
raising the size of loads until this will bo
made the limit.

handed down an opinion this afternoon
sustaining the demurrer In the InteresMrg
1 suit brought by the Wlnemakers* Corpo
â  ration against K. Schmidt. The o.,urt
! holds, among other things, that the plain
tiffs based their complaint upon the the
ory that the whole vintage was sold,
while in the court's opinion only one
tenth was disposed of. Also that while
, the plaintiffs say they were damaged by
' reason of the defendant's failure to trans
fer his wine, no evidence w.-is put In to
show that the wine could not have been
i obtained elsewhere.
DISCUSSED BIBLE
WITH THE JUDGE
Unusual Role Played by
a Murderer.
Bp^cinl Dlcpat.-h to Th* Call.
RAKERSKIELD. Dec. 11.â To-day when
Judm Malion was about to pronounce the
death sentence on Murderer ThUml Mo
lina he asked the customary question if
the prisoner had anything to say why
sentence should not be pronounced. Mo
lina's coM countenance lighted up and
with a smile he answered:
"Your Honor. I hoj>.- you will put the
date of the --xecution as far off as possi
ble."
"Why?" o/iestioned the court.
"I want time to ask for the forgiveness
of my Savior," was the prisoner's reply.
"What have you been doing foe the past
two years at Ban QuemUnT' queried the
Judge. Cot tinning he expressed a doubt
that there was any pardon in the heavenly
court for such a red-handed murderer.
"I don't bo understand by my reading of
my Bible."' politely retorted Molina a* he
drew nearer the Judge. "1 never sinned
against the Holy (Jhost. and as 1 read
that Is th.i only unpardonable sin. At any
r;it<* no one h;t.s returned from heaven or
hell to tell us different.
By this time Judge M;ihon saw that hÂ«
was becoming enabsiraaslnito tangled in
a theological discussion and ho proceeded
to pronounce the solemn sentence, at the
conclusion of which Molina with all the
grace of a Spanish gentleman said;
"Thank you."
The date of his execution was fixed at
January 12. In 1X97 Molina murdered Joso
Ramos in cnid Mood. Ever since the ease
baa bnen tied up in the Supreme Court.
At the Jail some one said to Molina:
"It's about all up with you."
"No." was his reply. "I will never de
ppnir until the rope Is round my neck and
the black cap pulled down."

MANDAMUS SUIT
AGAINST AUDITOR
San Rafael Boulevard
Is Concerned.
LABOR WARRANTS NOT PAID
COMMITTEE SEEKS TO HAVE
THE PAPERS SIGNED.
â¦
Very Important Point Affecting the
Driveway Project Is to Be
Considered by the
Court.
Special Dlfpatch to The Call.
RAN RAFAKI., Dec. U.â Suit in man
damus was filed against Auditor X J
Connell to-day by Attorney E. M.-Martln
ellt to compel him to attach his signature
!<â  warrants for the payment of v>>rk on
the Tiburon boulevard. If tbfl Auditor '
is compelled to audit the warrants the
proponent! of the great county road will
have wnn a decisive victory and the suc
cess of the undertaking may be regarded
as an assured fact.
The Tiburon boulevard was begun seven
year* ago. When completed it will con
nect this city with Tiburon and in time
branch roads will take in Sausalito and
Mill Valley. Three years ago the Legis
lature became Interested in the project i
and gave permission to the Warden of i
San Quentin prison to permit the con- I
victs to labor on the boulevard. They
iii.w h.-ive the "marsh section" nearly
completed. It is admitted by experts that !
the boulevard will f<Â«rm. when completed,
one of the handsomest driveways in the
State.
Sections 4 and 5 were contracted for at
the last Session of the Supervisors, but
previously to that trouble had arisen over
the refusal of Auditor Council to audit
warrants for the payment of the work on
sections 1, 2 and 3 because the money was
to be appropriated from the general rond
fund an<l oof the district road fund. Jesse
â¢ 'nlwell and l,unny Â£: Kedmond have as
t-lKn^l thÂ«lr claims to the Buckman Con
tracting Company, who In turn have as
signed all claims to S. H. Cheda & Co..
the local bankers, Cheda &. Co. bring the
suit.
The payment for the work has largely
been a matter of private subscription.
Among the most earnest supporters of
the project have been President A. W.
Poster of the California Northwestern
Railway Company and Prison Director
James H. Wilklns.

PANAMA RATES LOWERED.
Pacific Mail Makes a Reduction in
Its New York Fares.
Beginning with the next irip of the
San Jose <>n the IMh of this month the
Pacific Mall Company Â«'W make a reduc
tion of fares to Now York and to Pan
ama. The present fares, as they now
stand are M2"t for a main deck e.ibln pass
nj:e arid JI2C for an upper deck I nssage to
Now York These rates will bo reduced
SIS each. making the fare $105 and $110. re-
BDCCtlveiy. Th- steerage passage will be
reduced from $.">0 to $40. The far* to Pan
ama now stands at $115 cabin and $..7 GO
steerage. This will be cut down to $lIW
and $50.
The reason for this reduction, so nay
the Pacific Mall officials, is simply to in
crease the travel by water and to at
tempt to adjust the rates to the best In
terests of the company considered from
a commercial standpoint. Competition,
they say. has nothing to do with It. for the
reason that at present no competition tx-

Fhtars pulled a repeating; rifle from his
vagon, and taking careful aim. shot his
assailant through the heart, killing him
instantly.
When the father and the brothers of
the dead man arrived on the scene the
f.nmer was craxed by the sight of his
dead boy, who lay on hu back In tho
back yard of the hotel. The father rushed
at the murderer with a wa*:on neck yoke,
but was stopped by bystanders. It took
the combined foreÂ«- of three strong men
to prevent the Infuriated father from
killing the slayer of his son.
In the meantime one of the brothers of
the deceased procured a gun. and had he>
not been seen In time there certainly
would have been another killing.
The trouble Is not yet over The ver

THE ROSSER CASE.
II vindication of justice that the courts
of this city have at last succeeded in convicting a
nepro soldier of an attempt at murder. Just before
this conviction a white lieutenant had without cause
fired on a peaceable citiren, and that another murder
was not committed was not the fault of the wretch
in uniform, who was promptly discharged, though
his offense was far more heinous than that of the
CCgro. These lent*, taken in connection with the
acquittal of Rosscr, are far from placing our admin
i tn.tion of law and order in a favorable light before
the country- Rosier should have been convicted and
hanged. There was nothing in his record to show
that he was any more than i degraded pervert, on
whom education had produced no humanizing im
pression. Sympathy for his parents and family was as
much their due before his crime as after. The trial \ras
a lachrymose farce, in which a sworn jury forgot its
oath and it< duty to society, and took upon itself a
f-harc of the blood guilt of Rosscr's second crime
just committed in Kew York. The verdict of ac
quittal was as great an insult to the proper military
fpirit of the army as it was a menace to the safety of
people in civil life. It is done and cannot be re
called, but it put the mark of Cain upon the jury
system of this city and fixed upon the legal profes
sion an odium which it should be anxious to avoid.
The murder of Hildebrand was without a single
palliating circumstance. The claim of the assassin
that his liquor had been drugged waÂ«t without the
slightest proof. He had imbibed the idea from the
;i?sault made by men of his regiment upon the in
offensive and defenseless negro clam digger, which
had recently occurred, that his uniform protected
him in the commission of any outrage upon a citizen.
This i(!ea was reflected in his boast, made in the
presence of the dead body of his victim, "1 killed
Vim like a gentleman and a soldier, sir!"
The retention of his murderous instinct and it* out
break in New York should admonish our courts to
a more positive tone in the charging of juries. It is
rot yet a settled principle of law that drunkenness
is an excuse for murder and a proper reason for the
acquittal of an assassin. The Rosser jury did its
despicable worst to jo settle it, but it it were so set
tled any wretch who nurses murder in his heart has
only to gorge himself with liquor to commit that
crime with impunity.

THE RECIPROCITY TREATIES.
PROTESTS made by Californians against the
reciprocity treaties with France and with Ja
maica, now pending in the Senate for ratifica
tion, may not have the effect of defeating the treaties;
but they will have that of showing the injustice
done the State, and may thereby serve to prevent fur
ther injustice in making treaties with other countries.
In the very nature of things a reciprocity treaty
with France, or with any other country that exports
fruit*, wines and nuts, must be more or less injurious
to California, since it can hardly do otherwise than
admit the rxporters of those countries to something
like a free competition with the California producers.
That being so, the State Department should be very
careful not to carry such treaties too :Â»r or to grant
too many concessions. It is not fair that California
should be sacrificed to the advantage of the East. .It
will in the end be more bend to the Eastern peo
ple to build up the wine, oil. nut and raisin industry
here than to get an insecure market abroad by pur
chasing it at the price of ruin to California's rural in
dustries. ; '"'

FRYE ON THE PHILIPPINES.
P'NATOR FRYE has long been prominent on
the Senate Committee on Commerce and is re-
Karded as a standard American authority on
commercial questions. He has been regarded from
the beginning as a stanch imperialist, and therefore
â¢ interview on the Philippines will cati'-e
tome rarpnse
He is reported as saying that the Republican party
pcopaiCi certain policies in the Philippines, among
which are good government and decent wages, and
an effort K> arouse in the natives the ambition to be
â¢ good citizens. This latter proposition reminds
one of Rob Roy's reception of Bailie Nicol Jarvie's
c to the Highlander to give his sons an educa
tion.
Standards of life arc racial standards. Good citi
zenship may mean a far different thing to a Filipino
and a native of Maine.
The Senator adds that possibly the Filipinos may
become fit to establish â  republican, stable and strong
government, able to preserve order and peace, pro
ted life and property and observe their international
Obligation*, and that possibly, "when that time ar
rives," we, being the sole judges, might surrender to
them the sovereignty, reserving to ourselves naval
and coaling stations.
The Senator adds to this qualified promise that he
personally would never surrender the sovereignty to
any people, within the islands or without.
The first clauses of his interview hold a hope that
iÂ« snatched away by this last qualification.
Americans who believe in their institutions would
be delighted if this country should become the ac
tive agent in the founding of an Asiatic republic in
thote islands. Asian countries have long been gov
erned by absolutism and the strong hand. Their sub
jection to Occidental conquerors has not change!
their condition in that respect. This republic has
long been known to them as the world's best expo
ncnt of self-government. The name of Washington
, is known throughout the Orient and is respected M
that of the founder of self-government on this con
nt Bat the Filipinos are the first Asiatics to
enter into that enlightened condition in which they
have been fired by Washington's example. Senator
l'rye shows an uneasy conscience in the first part of
his interview and appears to feel in considerable
I strength the impulse of Republican principles. He
admit! that those people may become capable of ad
ministering independent government under repub
lican form*, but declare* that, even if they do, he
personally Â«HH oppose permitting them to enjoy
>r which they prove themselves fitted! This is
a vital inconsistency. He dues not, as a counter
proposition, express his intention to admit them as
citirens of this republic, panoplied in statehood an 1
i sharers of Â« -tir birthright of self-government, subject
to the constitution. Tin* means that when they prove
then: ; -.ble of soli-government they are not
to have it. either under a polity of their own or as
tizeni of the United States.
Any one will see at once the afflictions of such a
litkm. Tn their admission to full citizenship in
the United States our people will feel grave objec
tions. A republic to endure and fulfill its function
â¢ have racial homogeneity. No art nor education
can .iÂ»Â«i:nilate and abolish racial differences of char
acter. The strength spent in the effort is an economic
waste. Therefore it is the tact that if we do not
cherish, a- our ultimate purpose, the final indepen
; dence of the Philippines, on the line of our example
and under the shield <â¢! our friendship, we must bold
I them as a subject people, the spoil of our bow and
, spear. What the result will be can be foreseen in
( the recent r.priMnp in NVpros. The President's mes
sace dwells at length upon the happy conditions in
that iÂ«!and. Its people were represented as joyfully
accepting our "â ovcn.-itfnty and flattered by coning
! under our jurisdiction. But as soon aÂ« military rigi
j lanre over them was rehxed, and almost before the
President's words were in type, they rose and slaugh
< tered the only white man they could get at. a valuable
i and devoted army officer. There is every reason to
, believe that had a considerable number of American i
in civil life been among them they would all have
shared the fate of the luckless lieutenant who fell.
It iÂ« an expectation not based in human nature that
' we are to woo their friendship by doing for them
those things which they aspire to do for themselves.
Nebraska harbors a murderer who is perhaps the
mocf considerate on record. In deference to Thanks
giving day and in responÂ«e to an earnest pleading
he postponed a double assassination to the following
day.
BRITISH MANUFACTURING PROB
LEMS.
REPORTS for November con
l tains in a report from Rufus Fleming, United
State? Consul at Edinburgh, one of the most
interesting contributions yet made to the discussion
of manufacturing problems in Great Britain. It re
veals some of the causes of the decline in British in
dttstriei and the difficulties which stand in the way
ct improvement.
In the firi-t place British machinery is now far be
low the grade of efficiency reached by machines ttsri
in this country. As an illustration of this the case is
cited of a rope manufacturing company which re
cently made a test of an American machine in thei.
factory. The company, it is said, had four British
1 machines for preparing manila fiber for rope-making
The combined daily output of these machines did
not exceed three and a half tons, and each required
peratives. An American machine was intro
duced, costing $1000, about the price of the British
machines. It is worked by two operatives of the
same ctaÂ«>s and receiving the same pay as those work
, ing the British machines, but it turns out four tons
of the product a day, and if run at full speed could
make an output of five tons. Moreover, the product
1 of the American machine is of better quality than that
from the British. Here, then, is a gain of time, la
bor, wages and quality of product for the American
machine, and it is clear the British machinery can
not stand against such competition.
On that showing it would seem the British would
everywhere hasten to adopt the improved machinery
tad that <.ur machine-making establishments would
be rushed with British order?. It appears, however
there is a lion in the path. The British workman is
essentially conservative and he stands in antagonism
to the introduction of machinery that will result in
diminishing the number of men employed in any
particular industry. The British, it must be borne
in mind, have no wide field for the expansion of their
commerce just at this time, and any large increase in
the output of their manufactured goods would find
BO market. The extensive use of improved machin
ery would therefore mean the discharge of a con-
I.lc number of men, and should that be under
taken there would be a strike.
The Consul quotes a British engineer as saying:
"If the majority of skilled working people in the
United Kingdom do not abate their hostility to im
proved machinery and take the chances of a readjust
THE FAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1899.
ment of the mass of labor to the new mechanical
facilities by emigration or otherwise there is trouble
ahead, the consequences of which no man can meas
ure. The engineers' strike, which came toy an end in
1898, threatened the entire fabric of British industries
by shaking the confidence of the world and of our
own people in their productive power. Another
such experience would be disastrous beyond all cal
culation. Our manufacturers have to face that pos
sibility. I do not put it as a probability, because 1
am not a pessimist and prefer to look at the bright
side. It were useless, however, to blink the fact that
in the industrial revolution now going on, brought
about chiefly by American competition, there lurks
a grave peril."
It is indeed a dire dilemma that confronts the Brit
ish manufacturer and workingman. It appears
economic forces are already in operation which tend
to break down the fabric of the mighty empire which
until recently completely dominated the industrial
and commercial world. Great Britain can keep on
equal terms with all rivals in the machinery' of armies
and n.ivies, but it will not be so easy to withstand the
machines of peaceful industry that are beating her in
the markets of commerce.
Captain Carter, the convicted army officer who is re
sisting the sentence of his judges, must think that he
can be as extravagant with his own time as he was
with other people's money. He would be wise to be
gin the payment of a debt that can't be evaded.
Iâ;I â ; ROM an artistic point of view the edition of
The Call to be issued next Sunday will be by far
the most attractive and the most interesting
ever sent forth from the office of a Pacific Coast
newspaper. No expense of time, energy or money
has been spared to render the number beyond the
reach of rivalry, and its appearance will mark the
beginning of a new era in journalistic art in Cali
fornia.
The illuminated covers have been designed by
artists of the first rank and will be examples of the
best work that lithography can do in the way of
reproducing colors without exaggerating or losing
any of the most delicate tones and values of the
original. The contents of the number will be in
rnrmony with the exquisite finish of the covers.
There will be nothing freaky, gaudy or sensational,
but all will be bright, entertaining and fitted for the
holiday season in the homes of cultured families.
Mark Twain contributes to the number â  delight
fully droll account of "My First Lie, and How I Got
Out of It." Ouida, whose name and whose .vritings
have long been familiar to the lovers of romance, has
a story of "A Faithful Servant" which will add to her
reputation as a writer of short stories of dramatic
intensity. "The Record of My Wander-Year." by
Key. Peter C. Yorke, will be found instructive as
well as entertaining, while the description given of
"Christmas in California Before the Gringo Came,"
by Major Jose Ramon Pico, will have for all read
ers an historic as well as a romantic interest by rea
son of the fact that it deals with a condition of life
which has long since passed away, but the memory
of which will be perpetuated from generation to
generation in Californian song and story.
Among the other literary features are to be a par
ticularly bright array of Christmas stories and de
scriptive articles, including "Christmas of the Vete
rans," "Christmas at the Farallones," "The Fugi
tive's Christmas," "Christmas at Manila," "The Story
of a Haunted House," "The Kiss of Ninito Dios" and
"Found in the Snow," by Mary E. Wilkins.
To all who are in doubt what sort of gift to provide
for the CTiristmas season this edition of The Call will
be invaluable, for in its columns will be found ad
vertisements setting forth all manner of attractive
novelties or useful gifts and telling exactly where to
obtain them. These features of the paper will not be
the least interesting of its many attractions to the
general public. It will be, in fact, a species of guide
to the rich storehouses of Santa Claus in the city and
can be studied with advantage and profit by all.
The shocking suicide of a crazed patient at the
Receiving Hospital is another indication that death
is a welcome visitor to the institution. It is small
wonder that the doors are barred to a scrutinizing
public.
THE MUNICIPALITIES CONVENTION
OUT of the convention of Californian municipah
tw - which is to assemble in this city during
the week there ought to come something more
than discussion, though even that is likely to prove
beneficial. On this coast we have lagged far behind
the East in considering municipal problems and in
devising means of municipal progress. It is no dis
credit to us that it should be so, for improvement in
communities, like improvement in individuals, is de
pendent largely upon the existence of evils that force
the improvement to be undertaken. Most Californian
cities arc comparatively young and have not reached
the period of development which marks those of the
East that have been most enterprising in the path of
progress.
While we have not felt the necessity for muni
cipal progress that has been noted in older communi
ties, it would none the less be wise for us to profit by
their experience and adopt improved methods of
municipal administration before we feel the worse
effects of the evils from which they are now trying
to escape. For that reason everything in the form
of earnest discussion by men who have practical con
trol of municipal matters is to be commended. Much
of the talk may be idle, but where serious men meet
to consider practical problems there is very sure to
bÂ« much of mutual benefit from the exchange of
opinions.
Every municipality in the State is to some extent
seeking to improve its conditions and solve some of
the difficulties that attend the administration of citie-=.
The officials of each have therefore acquired by ex
perience something of administrative wi-dom from
which others can learn. Moreover, there is much
to be attained in the way of organizing for united
work to bring about reforms or amendments in State
laws affecting cities which have been found to be un
wisely devised. For all these reasons that portion of
the people who have a proper regard for municipal
isfties will watch with no little interest the proceed
ings of the convention. The programme of discr.s
sicn has been well arranged, and the meeting wil!
doubtle<Â£ prove profitable in many ways.
A local sneakthiel who has escaped punishment
after being arrested twenty-eight times wants to be
adjudged insane. He probably thinks that the au
thorities are as good judges of sanity as they are of
justice.
Carl Becker, the prince of forgers, hns at last found
an occupation commensurate with his ability and
perfectly safe to the community. He is writing
jouvenir programmes at San Qucntin prison.

PANIC IN THE
SAN FRAN CISCO
GAS MONOPOLY
Wages Cut and Em
ployes Discharged.
RETRENCHMENT NECESSARY
The San Francisco Gnu Light Compaq-
Is having troubles of Its own. First the
Mayor succeeded in having the rate re
duced from Jl 75 to $1 50 per thousand,
which was something of a calamity In lt
s"lf, viewed from the standpoint of the
stockholders In the concern, and then a
and powerful opposition sprung up
which will soon enter the field, heretofore
the almost exclusive property of the Gaa
Light Company, with unlimited financial
backing to push It forward and the best
business brains In the community to di
rect Its course.
The Gas Light Company might have
been able to stand the reduction on its
charges, but the competition of the Inde
pendent Electric Light and Power Com
pany promises to give the older concern
a run for its patronage which will tax
its financial strength to the upmost and
the directors of the Gas Light Company
have already decided to prepare for the
struggle. With characteristic selfishness
they nave decided to put tho tlrst burden
of retrenchment on tho shoulders least
able to bear It and have started a cut in
the salaries of the employes, which has
reduced the remuneration of those poor
unfortunates about one-half.
At the last meeting of the board of di
rectors the subject of retrenchment came
up and It was decided that, owing to the
recent reduction In the charges and the
powerful competition. the company would
soon be called upon to meet, something
should be done to reduce the running ex
penses of the corporation. 'Many plans
were discussed, but the one of reducing
the salaries of the various employes found
the most favor and was finally adopted.
Consequent upon this action of the
board the salary of the president. Joseph
B. Crockett, was sliced from $15,000 a year
to, report says, the sum of $7300, and fol
lowing him each employe of the company
was Informed that hereafter he would
be expected to do his work at about one
half the figure he had previously received.
, The men to whom this reduction applied
â were the lucky ones, who because or the
importance of their positions or for other
reasons were considered valuable enough
to retain.
The smaller fry. those who had no dig
nity of position or power of pull to plead
for them, lost their heads" entirely. They
â¢were Informed that their services. were no
longer required, and the consequence Is
that a number of men who imagined that'
they had secure places are now walking
nrountl looking for something to do.
When seen yesterday Mr. Crockett and
some of the directors admitted that a
great reduction of salaries had taken
place, but the exact sizes of the pieces that
had been sliced off they would not say
The report of 'the street, however, gives
one-half as the correct amount.
Mr. Crockett said the step had been
taken with the Idea of putting the con
cern on a paving commercial basin con
sistent with the new order of things that
had followed on the reduction by the city
of the SI 75 rate. . . â  cuy
Th* fact of the matter is that while the
new $1 50 rate has much to do with It vet
the advent of the Independent Electric
Light and Power Company ha* caused

the contest as the men. A blackboard was hung on the

OVERDUE DEEP-WATER SHIPS
SOME OF THEM ARE CAUSING
MUCH UNEASINESS.
Two mail steamers and one transport
made port yesterday. The America Maru

She made the run from Honolulu tn the

ful one. Both the City of Fara and Zea
land:.!, which arrived from Manila Sun
day, will be Tf turned to their owners as
BOOS as the damage to them has beÂ«n aa
â eaaed by a board <>t survey.
The British steamer Bloemfonteln Is
now overdue at Honolulu from Newcas
' tie. N. S. W. She is loaded with 'coal, and
was nearly seventeen days late when the
America Maru leit Honolulu. The chances
are that her machinery broke down and
that she will be picked up and towed into
1 port by Borne ocean liner.
The overdue. British ship St. Enoch, now
I out 15-1 days from Panama for Portland,
has been heard from again. Last Novem-
I ber 6 per cent reinsurance was being paid
1 on her and then she showed up on* the
Columbia River bar and took a pilot
I aboard. That was on November 17, and
about that time the southeaster came up
and ship and pilot were driven off shore.
From that time until yesterday morning
nothlnK was heard of the St. Enoch, and
the reinsurance on her had gone back to
10 per cent. Now she has appeared again
off the Columbia River and will probably
I be safe In port to-day.
Another vessel that is and has been
causing uneasiness is the French bark
Ixiuls Pasteur, now out IS3 days from
Limerick. Ireland, for Portland. Or. Bhe

degrees north, longitude 27 degrees west,

Later she was In company with the ship
; Blanca off the Horn, and as the latter was
wrecked grave fears are entertained for
the Louis Pasteur. The underwriters are
paying 20 per cent reinsurance on her. -
Gray & Mitchell's new steamer Dispatch
received a thorough baptism on her first
voyage tp Portland. She had to fight a
gale both going and coming and suffered
considerably In consequence. When off
the Columbia River bar the lightship sig
naled that she wanted to speak the Dis

Dispatch, but It was nearly a week before
the steamer could stand in over the bar.
When Astoria was reached the chief en
gineer discovered that the vessel he had
left five days previously had been driven
from her moorings and WSJ a total wreck.
On the return trip the Dispatch found
trouble again. The windows were smashed
in, ratling curried away, cabin flooded and
other minor damage done. Through it all
the steamer proved herself an admirable
seaboat.
The schooner Mlzpah and her nineteen
owners are In a peck of trouble. All of
the latter except Captain Owens are
sheep raisers and know nothing about a
sailing vessel. The captain has chartered
the vessel to carry a load of dynamite to
Amapala and the other owners refuse to
let her go. In consequence there are In
junctions and restraining orders by the
dozen, and the Mlzpah bids fair to be
eaten up in litigation before the matter Is
settled.

THE PLANS OF LIQUIDATION
MANY YEARS REQUIRED TO
WIND UP AFFAIRS.
George Crocker, second vice president of
the Southern Pacific Company, arrived in
San FiancJsco night before last and yes
terday received many callers at his office
in the yellow building. Before Mr. Crocker
left New York for the Pacific Coast ThÂ«
Call announced that he would travel via
New Orleans and tarry en route to inspect
properties of the Pacific Improvein. Nt
Company In Louisiana and Texas. He
was asked yesterday If his plans in this
â¢ had been carried out. Speaking
of the Pacific Improvement Company he
â aid:
"Many newspaper reports regarding the
affairs of the Pacific Improvement Com
pany and particularly the stories that the
company's property is to be sold outright
are incorrect. The Call's statement that
the affairs of the company will be wound
up by liquidation 1b correct. 1 left New
York with the intention of acquiring in
formation concerning the value and con
dition of the company's property and
where I did not make personal inspection
I secured data from records and agents.
"Ten or fifteen years' time may be need
ed to wind up the affairs of the company.
The amount ultimately realized will d.
pend upon conditions of prosperity and
the development of the country. 1 can
not approximate the valuÂ« of the Pacltlc
Improvement Company's property. The
holdings consist of coal mines, steam
ships, timber lands, hotels railroads,
stocks, bonds and aecurltU-s. For example
the Carbonado coal mines, where the re
cent disaster occurred, belong to the com
pany. The hotels of Castle crags and Del
Monte are owned by the concern. The
company owns a rauway and coal mines
on Vancouver Island, British Columbia
also valuable lands near Santa Barbara,
Cal. In Louisiana and Texas the company
has large Interests. "
Concerning the rumor of his resignation
from ihe office of vice president of the
Southern Pacific Company Mr. Crocker
remarked:
"I nm still second vice president of the
company. I have not resigned. I shall
probably serve until next January, when
my successor may be chos'-ii. My* present
plani are to remain in California for six
weeks. No, I cannot tell you when C. P.
Huntlngton will leave New York for Cali
fornia or how long he will remain after
his urrlvnl here."
Mr. Crocker does not care to discuss the
Senatorial situation. In fact he frankly
admits that the newspapers are mu^h bet
tor informed than he Is regarding the
plane of the candidates.

POLICE COURT SCANDAL.
A Japanese Charged $2 50 for Being
Furnished With a Warrant Out
of Judge Graham's Court.
William Ye, a Japanese student re
siding at 22 Prospect place, related a
strange -.tory of "grafting" yesterday to
Lieutenant Esola at the California street
police station. He said that he hud paid
a man named Harris, 62C-62S Kearny
street, $9 for an overcoat, and that when
he brought It to the door to examine It
In the light he found that It waa not wool,
as had been stated, and demanded that
another be given him Instead. Harris was
unable to suit him and refused to make
any further changes. Ye refused to take
any of the coats and demanded his money
back, which Harris refused.
Then Ye went to Police Judge Graham
court to get a warrant and was directed
to a room adjoining the courtroom, where
he found a clean-shaved, bareheaded m.in
seated at a desk writing. The man said
that he was Judge Graham's <-ourtr . m
clerk and that he would issue the warrant
for $5. The Jap said that he did not lave
that sum Of money with him and proposed
$2 50, which the "clerk" accepted and
made out a warrant for the arrest of
Harris. The Jap brought It to the Cali
fornia street station as requested an it
was there found that the Judge's name
was not :Â»lgncu to It. Lieutenant EsoTa re
ported the matter to the Police Depart
ment and the "grafter" will be looked
after. â¢â¢â¢ â¢ â '"

VIL SIR ANTHONY VAN DYCK.
BY ARTHUR HOEBER.
(Concluded.)
It was with religious pictures that Van ;
Dyck now occupied himself for awhile. (
His first subject was "The Adoration of
the Shepherds." for which he was to get
400 florins, or about 110), not, It will be ad
mitted, an exorbitant price; but even this \
modest sum was objected to by the con- |
fraternity of the church for which the
canvas was painted, and Van Dyck, In '
order to dispose of It to a private patron j
at this price. was obliged to throw In a ,
portrait, by way of good measure. After
this he painted a "St. Augustine In Ecs- <
tasy," and his price was advanced to 600
florins; once more his patron demurred
at the expense, and this time it was a
small head of Christ that he gave to in- i
duce him to keep his contract. Happily, ,
he had no trouble after this in finding
commissions, and for five years the work
poured In. Among his great compositions
of this period are "The Crucifixion," "The
Marriage of St. Catharine," the "Ecce
Homo." "The Raising of the Cross" and
"The Infant Christ Crowning St. Rosa-
VAN DYCK'S "BABY STUAkT."
He." In all more than thirty Important
religious compositions were executed,
while in between Van Dyck did many '
splendid portraits and made a long series
of remarkable sketches in tints, many of
which he subsequently etched, while oth
ers were engraved and published by Mar
tin Vanden Enden.
It was impossible to achieve all this suc
cess without inciting the malice and envy
of some of the lesser minds among his
contemporaries, and Van Dyck. who was
of a highly sensitive nature, was deeply
irritated by the covert attacks subse
quently made upon him. They finally be
came so annoying that he concluded to
leave the country for awhile, and In 1629,
he went to England. This visit was not
successful, however, and for some reason
or other he did not attract much atten
tion from the King and the court. He
had come upon the Invitation of his
friend and patron, the Karl of Arundel;
unhappily, at that time Arundel was not
in favor with his royal master, but three
years later, the Duke of Buckingham be
ing dead, the Earl was once more per
mitted to bask In th* sunshine of the
royal presence, and with the consent of
his august master an official Invitation
was this time Issued to the great Fleming
to repeat the visit, and so he returned un
der the best of auspices.
Coming to London In the early spring of
163* Van Dyck received a reception bent
ting his rank an a painter of the greatest
distinction. He was properly lodged and
all his expenses were borne by the crown.
A house was found for him In Blackfrlars,
probably a. large mansion belonging to the
King, and a summer resort was provid
ed down in the county of Kent. It did not
take him long to become the social lion
of the day. His manners were most at
tractive, though not less so than his per
son He possessed elegance and distinc
tion to a superlative degree, for he had
ever mingled with the best people in all
the countries wherein he had traveled, he
was sparkling In conversation and. rare
distinction for those days, he had trav
eled extensively. Besides all this his Ku
ropean reputation was known in London.
It was not, therefore, remarkable that us
studio should De tilled constantly with
the most fashionable crowds; titters came
In thronKs; the King, the Queen, all the
royal family, the great noblemen, crowd
ed one another for the honor of posing.
Not to have a portrait by Van Dyck was
to be out of the social world. He hail been
made painter In ordinary to his Majesty
almost immediately on his arrival, and.
humanity being presumably the same In
those days as it is now, there were many
heartburns among the mass of painters
whose stars were dimmed by the advent
of the new favorite.
Despite his financial success Â«nd the
bestowal upon him of a pension by the
King, Van Dyck lived at so rapid a pace
and spent his money so profusely that he
was continually In dire straits. He was
hospitable, he entertained most liberally,
and no small portion of his earnings was
contributed to the fair sex, for In an .-ge
of great gallantry there were few men In
London who exceeded him In their atten
tions to femininity. He had been knight
ed shortly after his arrival and, mlngi'ng
with the b<st people In the land, he fool
ishly tried to emulate the splendor of their
entertainments. Curiously enough, he
surrounded himself with a set of lisp
tnrs who secured large sums from him In
their alleged efforts and experimenting
to find the philosopher's stone, whir He
firmly believed to be a possibility. Brood-
Ing over his financial troubles, fatigued
with the constant work at portraiture,
and worn out by the confinement, the .x
ious gases and close air of the laboratory
wherein lie spent much time maklngchem
leal experiments In his search for tie
philosopher's stone, his condition became
such as to alarm his friends, of wnom
none were more solicitous than the King
himself. It was finally concluded, all
things considered, that he ougl.t to get
married, and through the Influence of
Charles an excellent match was arranged,
the lady in question being a member of
the Queen's household. Thus It was that
Maria Ruthven became his wife. The
King once more showed his friendliness
by providing a dowry from his privy
sources.
The marriage over. Van Dyck interested
himself In working out a scheme for the
decoration of Whitehall, his master, Ru
bens having already made some frescoes
for the banqueting room; for these lie de
manded the .somewhat substantial sum of
Â£75,000, but the royal exchequer was low
at this time, and the proposal was de
clined after he had spent rnrnldÂ°rnt.)lc
time In making sketches for the 'work
Chagrined by the refusal of a project on
which he had so set his heart, he became
wretchedly morbid, and his health al
ready none of the best, was seriously af
fected. He resolved on a Journey home
where, with his .wife, he waa received
with every demonstration of love and af
fection, fetes being Riven in his honor.
More disappointment waÂ« waiting for
him: he spent two months In l"artÂ« en
deavoring unsuccessfully to obtain a cotn
mission to decorate the great gallery of
th* Louvre: then came the rebellllon In
London and the withdrawal of the- royal
family; he was back In the English capl
tn! In thÂ« mtn.it of a terrible political ex
citement, which affected his health ad
verstly. and he never rallied, lie died
December 9, 1611. at the age of 42. and
thus unhappily passed away one of the
greatest of the world's artists.
Van Dyck wan an extraordinarily rapid
worker: his touch was marvelously sure,
for there wan no detail of his profession
of which he was not complete master.
Following the custom of the times, he, had
about him many pupils and assistants
whom he utilized to do all the more un
important parts of his canvases, such as
laying backgrounds and the putting on
the first painting of draperies and acces
sories. The drawing of the subjects and
the painting of the head and hands Van
Dyck attended to himself. It is said that
he never worked longer than one hour
at a time on any sitter: when the sixty
minutes had gone Van Dyck would bow
the patron out, another one generally be
ing in waiting to take the next turn.
Meanwhile his servants prepared fresh
I palette and brushes. The portraits hs
1 painted of Chnrles I numbered thirty-six.
: the most Important of which la the fa
mous one In the Louvre In Paris. Twenty
five portrait* of the Queen, Henrietta
Maria, are known to exist. There has
â  been catalogued a list of 971 of Van
1 nek's works, but there are of course
| many more which have escaped the cata-
I loguer.
There are several fine examples of Van
; Dyck's work In this country, no less than
four of which are owned by the Met
ropolitan Museum of Art In New York.
These include his really great work, the
portrait of James Stuart, Duke of Rich*
â¢ mond and Lennox, standing at full length
with a great greyhound beside him Van
Dyck was one of the most polUhed and
I suave painters of any epoch, and his color
| watÂ» nil that could be asked. lie drew
! with remarkable accuracy; his work was
, very personal and possessed the greatest
artistic distinction. Ills canvases appeal
ed with equal force to the connoisseur
and the layman, for they are so authori
tative that there Is no mistaking their
masterly qualities. When it Is remem
bered that he died at 42. and that there
lls scarcely a national gallery in tnÂ«
: world that does not possess one or more
Important examples. It will be seen what
a marvelously complete life he lived and
, how splendidly he fulfilled his mission,
i turning his glorious talents ever to the
best account. Well may his weaknesses
be forgiven and his foibles overlooked In
| view of the splendid use he made of the
I endowments that nature had given him.
j for he gave to the world the best that
i was in him. and dying left a name that
remains one of the moat brilliant In all
the chronicles of art.

NHW TORK. DM. II A perusal of the net
chnnrr* In prlre* of stocks as a result of the
day's trading will give but a faint conception
of the violent vicissitude" through which the
mnrTcrt^mmt*d~duili:K the five houia* iwi>s|-ir.
purlng the morning hours the drastic liquida
tion which was forced upon the market eaured
freat *aj>s '" Lne values of securities and the
tnarkrt tr<ok un an appearance of demoraliza
tion. The wide variations in prlres between
rule*, running â !â¢ high as 3 points, were evi
dence of the urgent character of the selling.
At the low point the scale of prices presented
a decidedly razeed appearance, declines In tht
Jong Hat of specialties ranging, as compared
with Saturday's clone, all the way from 1 to
21 point*, the latter In Tennessee Coal. Not- '
withstanding the day's violent fluctuations tha '

2 point*. The. liquidation t-eemed 10 have been !
; very thorough and l*Â« great Improvement In I
the tone of the market during- the latter part
of the day reflected the benefit to the health
of the speculative situation. The influences at j
work were so broad and well denned that they j
are aoon stated. One leading cause of the
weakness was the large decline made last
week, which â  Ipai out or nearly exhausted
margins on speculative account and the call- j
In* for additional margins forced large blocks !
of storks on the market. Many were forced to !
liquidate and there wop a large contingent {
whos* hope* of an upward turn In prices had â 
become exhausted and who threw over their
holding* In disgust, determined to await a
more favorable opportunity. The news of the
heavy reverie to the British anna In South ;
Africa helped to unsettle thin market. London
bought stocks â â â in the first hour, but this
wiÂ« simply to cover sales made earlier in Lon
don at a better figure. The very violence of ;
the felling movement worked Its own remedy ;
and th* day was not half over when evidences j
began to appear that urgent si-eculatlve ao-
I counts had been thoroughly shaken out and the
â¢ loan contraction eaÂ»M to a sufficient extent to |
afford material relief. The bears were steady '
buyers for the rest of the daj 1 and there \vuÂ« i
a sufficient contingent of. bargain-hunters on
hand to afford asulstance toward the recovery |
In prices. The character nf the Interests which
were most acutely <51 stressed was shown by
conspicuous weaknehs in the highly speculative
| Industrials. B-slde the decline of 81 point* in
Tennessee Cool there were losses of â . to 7
points In members of the metal group. Sugar. I
Tobacco and thÂ« New York speclnltlen. The
net loss of Tennessee Cahl and Iron for the ]
day was 14 points. In the railroads only a few â¢
ca?eÂ» occurred where declines reached over 2 j
points. New Y"rk Central. Pennsylvania, a '
numlÂ»er of the coalers. Louisville and Southern i
Pacific being conspicuous examples Kansas j
and Texas waa down near I points. The vigor- |
oub and determined aappon In Pillar waa the ;
turning point In the day's mark- Th- spec- j

; above the low point, scoring a full recovery
j not onfy of the early decline, but of the quar- I
terly dividend which was deducted from the â¢
! price to-day. There was a subscijuent decline |
of :\, i inta and the stork closed 14 higher I
than Saturday. The general list c!os<Â»d for the I
most part firm at the recovery. Except for j
the relief afforded by the day's liquidation the
signs of tightness In the money markets of
the world were unahnted.

NEW YORK, Dec. There was great de
mand for money to-day, with 15 per cent ruling
for ma early transactions. A large bank,
which has made heavy loans, marked up those
outstanding to 10 per cent and scrutinized close
ly the collateral offered (or new transactions at
higher rates. One Wall-street bank required
from 20 to 21 per cent margin, besides 10 to 16
points to spare on the stock for $100,000 loans.

bills. While â â¢â¢:â¢â  were puzzled over the
money situation here and abroad the prediction
wait made that demand bills would rule higher
throughout the week, with no prospect, how
ever, of touching the exporting point. One ot
the largest foreign exchange houHe* reported to
day's rate as fully two cents below the figure
at which gold under present conditions could be
profitably sent abroad.

BIG SCHEME
OF A LOCAL
IMPRESARIO
Patrizi Returns With
Many Surprises.
TREAT FOR MUSIC LOVERS
â¦- â
Btock Company to Support Foreign
Talent, Making Grand Opera
Possible at a Compara
tively Small Outlay.
Ettoel Patrirl. who left this city for
Italy last July with aspirations to become
an impresario, has returned with all hU
fondest hopes fulfilled and bringing a
liudpft of fcootl thing* In the musical Hue,
all booked tor Fan Francisco.' In thÂ« first
place. Mr. Patrizl haÂ» been appointed sj>e
otn! rf prp*entatlve In San Francisco of
ell the noted musical composers that aro
represented In Italy by Sonzogno. PatÂ«
riris duties as coast representative of
Mascagnl. Giordano ami Leoncavallo will
be to apprise these famous â â ;.>-. rÂ»
each time one of their compositions Is
beard on t'te const an.l in their names ccl
lert the royalties due them.
When Patrirl left here his scheme was
to bring to Morosco nil the latest musical
composition*, have them put on here, em-
X>Joyln(t for that purj >o *e only foreign piin
clpals. The orchestra and chorus were to
rave hern Morocco's own. thereby mak
ing it possible to produce grand opera In
a way to tain the approval of the most
critical sir.d at a nominal expense.
Thus fur the local impresario has ac
complished everything he undertook to do.
Artists inj composers have sicned and it
only remains for Morosco to definitely
decide to continue the Grand Opera
house atÂ« a lemrJe of music for all nego
tiations to lÂ»e completed. The only hitch
t-.x present is the possibility of the man
ager of the Mission MreÂ«>t house return
ing to his first love â melodrama. Grau Is
to rime out with Calve in February. Af
ter that it is undecided whether music
cr the plrtorlal drama will hold the Mts-
Flon etreÂ«t Matre.
MnrosoVp desertion of music, however,
<3oeÂ» not m*-an the abandonment of the
Patrizl nlsns. Other manager* are In lac
X'.Hil blowing for the local man's attrac
tions. On Patrizr* hooks are the woiks
of the comjHisers for whom he has b*tn
:â¢..,.'.- coast representative and the older
enmposors ar. well. The operas to b* pio
duced will Include "Amico Fritz." "Iris."
â¢Rantznu." "Andrea Chenier." "Fedora"
and Puccini's "La Tosca." which will re
ceive itR ui.tlnl production in Rome on the
3'th of January. ISKfI.
Tlie artists thus far engaged Include
Valllni for leader and Augustlna Mont
finarl, mezzo soprano. The choice of
lyric soprano rests between Repetto, Tor-
MUa and Tetrazzlni. Repetto was out
here with the ill-fated Lomhardis, while
the other two divas are among the lend
ing favorltÂ«s in musical Italy. Another
preat card vocure.i by â  trial Ik the book-
Ing of Sontopno. who will bring out Mas
rarnl. Giordan! and I^eoncavallo. On me
Mights the operas of these great com
posers are glv.n they will take the baton
and themschrs. respectively, lead the or
chestra. This w.moerful trio will not
mmc out before the end of next year
They will tr>ur the Inlted States previous
to coming to this city.
Patrlzl> wason will begin some time
In i-ebruar>' and continue each year for
a period of twelve weeks.
Grand Opera-House.
At the Grand they have revived "The
.â ;..t:;. sof Xormandy" Ills week. This
means, of course, crowded houses, for It
cannot be gainsaid that this opera, with
its bright sparks of good music, forms
r<al!y the very best production presented
at that place. William Wolff, with his
F-joi-.-Fsful adaptability to strong dramatic
situations, has never shown any better
rr-a.*"n for b<-Ing called an actor than by
his Impersonation of old Gaspard. nor has
Hattle BÂ«-lle Ladd ever achieved greater
njrcess than In her conception of Ger
malne. Thomas H. TerÃse's lyric tenor
lia.Â« regained Its timbre and clearness and
hlÂ» majiv admirers are not backward In
manifesting their sincere delight over
this happy circumstance. Ethel Strachan
Is once more given a chance to glimmer
.. little beside the greater stars and once
more phe does credit to her role. She de
pervrs to l>e encouraged. Naturally Edith
Mnsr>r. is right In her element when en
trusted with a pouhrette part.

WARDE IN "THE
LION'S MOUTH"
AT COLUMBIA
Popular Tragedian Is
Warmly Received.
"CHIMES OF NORMANDY"
Ferris Hartman Triumphant at the
Tivoliâ "Fatal Card" at the
Californiaâ The Alhambra
Presents Colored Fun.
There Is a chance for enlightenment In
"The Lion's Mouth." That Is no small
recommendation. Frederick WardÂ© open
ed In that plat at the Columbia last night
and was warmly greeted. There were
curtain call* and then there wan a speech
âa cut and dried speech. It Is trueâ with a
covert compliment to Ban Francisco's su
perior taste; and although the play Is old
It was not impolitic of Mr WardÂ© to
open In it. for It has merits of Its own
and affords an opportunity to show the
merits of the company. .
The production of such plays should be
encouraged, for while It Is not great nor
convincing. It Is In much better taste than
most of the dramas that aro being offered
to us of late.
Henry Guy Cnrleton Is a dramatist of
esthetic discretion and we should be
grateful Indeed for his literacy and sense
Of fitness. His sensibility to literate art.
the grace and force of his phrasing, has
an educational value and afford a pabu- ;
lum for the public that Is not to be de
fplsed. It were well for any one to Â»cc
"The Icon's Mouth." wherein one may
find a conscientious corrective for the
banalities of the common drama. The uu
thor has written with a poetic sense of
verbal fitness and does not. even In his
ultra romantic moments, become over-tur-
Md nor lose the key of dignified dialogue.
It Is sometimes a matter for wonder that
In the many good passages of the play he
does not fall from the standard of liter
ary excellence. It Is also a matter of
satisfaction.
I am not an admirer of trie conscien
tious Warde. but Ms foibles do not dis
tress onÂ»Â« In this part of Rlnaldo. True,
there Is still the Insensate emphasis, and. ,
what Is worse, the studied gestures that
flow from him as waves from the prow
of a ferry-boat. My word for it. Mr.
Ward*-, your gestures are too serpentine.
I will allow that you have trained your
self in this phase of dramatic expression
most diligently, but. in the parlance of i
the pug, you are "overtrained."
Minnie Tittle Brune, who supports, gives
a girlish impersonation of Marcella with
flashes of force. 1 think she Is an actress
to be reckoned with within the sphere of
her physical limitations. The company
Is remarkable In its avoidance of In
eptitude.- all of the poles are acceptably
assumed and some show distinct merit.
I woul<J instance particularly Frank
Hcnnig as Marco, who In the second act
Is entrusted with an opportunity to read
well his good lines, a feat which he ac
complishes with much credit to himself.
Charles Herman as Fra Angelo is a
patent apostle of W*rd*. and. within the
j lines of that actor's style, acts well. The
! atmosphere of . romance Is fairly con- 1
served without the aid of transitive emo
tion, and. from first to last, one doe* not
take the trouble to be bored.
PORTER GARXETT.
Orpbeum.
Hamilton Hill, the great Australian
barytone; Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Milton
Hoyle. Camilla TVArvllle and George Ful
ler Golden are among the stars the Orph- !
cum has to offer its patrons this week,
any one of which alone ought to more !
than carry a first-class vandevllle show. \
Hill is a newcomer, but It did not take
the audience long to discover the fact that
an artist of no mean ability was before
them. Even before he came to the refrain
of his first selection there was a com
; forting and hearty demand for more, and
the clear, true barytone notes answered
the call cheerfully and many times.
The playlet the Royles offer. "The High
ball Family," has been seen at the Orph
eum before. It Is a farce with a "truly"
plot, snugly and coherently written and â 
In the hands of its author and interpreter
can stand several repetitions.
California.
"The Nine of Spades" was the fatal
card that gives title to a melodrama of
the glaring kind, albeit not badly written,
but yellow enough to pet an old Morosco
audience on fire But It was not a Mo
rosco audience that attended the Califor
nia last night. There was some of the
Nob Hill flavor about it. and the "young
men in the gallery didn't whistle and veil
in the good old-fashioned way, but they
clapped their hands In harmony with the
loge and the dress circle at the good
points that were made.
Chutes.
Major Mite followed his imitation of
Cornllle by singing nn English effusion.
"And His Little Wife Was With Him All
the Tim*." at the Chutes Theater last
night. Fred and Amy Gottlob, Dutch
comedians: "Senator" Hamden, a colored
monologlst, and Walsh, an aerial contor
tionist, were new and all made hits. Ad
gle and her lions. Frank Hal', subduing
Wallace; Rita Winfleld. the violinist, ana
moving pictures completed an interesting
programme.
Alcazar.
The attendance at the Alcazar Theater
last night was not as large as usual, ow
ing, possibly, to the inclemency of the
. r "Mother Earth" was put on In
good style, but the curtain raiser, "t'p to
Watklns." mas somewhat of a disappoint
ment, but will probnbly run smoother
later on. The second act of "Mother
Earth" Is open to pome criticism, and
until It is retouched it will not meet with
the sure**? whlrh It deserves.

The Ebell Society's fund for the library
site grows aa the days go by. It has
reached the $18,000 mark and there ire
still sevpral day* In which to collect the
remaining nmount.
It 1b i-xpocted that the Library nigh: at
the Firm Presbyterian Church on Thurs
day evening will not only bring the fund
up to Us *ull amount, but will even leave
a surplus, which can bÂ« applied for the
furnishing of the building.
The ladies have agreed to dcuble the
', children's fund 'and give that amount
! toward the furnishing of the building, a.id
If anything is left over and above Â»he
I J20.0U0 necessary for the purchase of the
' site that will also go for that ouject.
Library right Is depended upon as a
great feature of this move. There will be
i music of the best, for there is much vol
j unteer talent to select from, and addresses
upon the object which It Is desired to
i reach. If this does not complete the fund
| and leave a surplus It will fall upon 'he
city of Oakland and not the ladies of the
Ebell society, who have given their tine
; and labor to this end.
No very large* donations wore received
to-day except from the Oakland Transit
Company, which turned over $200 to the
i ladles as the 15 per cent of the gross mi
i come of the roads upon Saturday last.
Rev. B. Fay Mills of the Unitarian
, church, not content with alone preaching
In support of the ladles, to-day sent Jlu
toward the fund.
The Carpenters' Union of the Brotlur
i hood of Carpenters has officially notified
the Ebell through Mrs. S. C. Borland that
, they would give the last $25 needed to
complete the fund.
The Teachers' Club of Oakland sent $20
to-day rind many local organizations are
doing the same.
Police Captain W. J. Peterson has un
dertaken to raise a fund among the mem
bers of the Police Department. Nearly
all of the members have donated s< ms
ranging from 50 cents to $2 if and only a
few have refused to give to the fund. he
list Is not yet quite complete, but it Is
expected that every member will finally
contribute.

THE CENTRAL IMPROVEMENT
CLUB'S DENUNCIATION.
Mayor Phelan Advocates Cultivation
of the Beautiful in San Fran
cisco.
Th* ranks of the "Western Addition Im
provement Club were recruited by repre
sentatives of thirty other city civic and
Improvement organizations, when Chair
man N. B. Greenfelder called the special
"missionary" meeting to order In Frank
lin Hail. Killmore am! Hush, last evening.
The united clubs met under the title of
the Central Club of Civic Improvement
Organizations, and the first business
transacted by It was to pass on resolu
tions opposing the method* of Imposition
and extortion practiced by the City Tele
phone Company. The main points In the
present system attacked were as follows:
Whereas. The telephone rates as charged in
the city and county of San Francisco are more
than a reasonable rental for the money In
vented or the service elven by the said tele
phone company, and the extra charge of 6
cent* for each and every switch U an out
rat* mm extortion and Imposition; and whereat.
I cents per twitch Is chanced, said sum lit
sufficient to cover expense of service without
rental fee for telephone; and whereas, the tele
ph<>ne company being a corporation and enjoy
ing a monopoly of a public convenience, the
Board of Supervisors should have the game
right to regulate the rate of charges as In the
matter of gas, water, etc., and whereas, the
telephone system being a public convenience.
Inaugurated, managed and used an such, should
belong to and be operated by the municipality,
the tame as water works, street railway*, gas
and electric light works: now. therefore, be It
Resolved, My the Western Addition Improve
ment Club, that the Board of Supervisors of
the city and county of San Francisco be and
hereby Is petitioned to take steps to reduce
the present exorbitant telephone rates, to de
vl!-e means toward municipal ownership of
this gigantic telephone monopoly, to permit not
more than one subscriber on one line, to com
pel a flat rate of rental no higher than present
rates with nlrkel-ln-Mot attachment, or allow
the nickel attachment without additional ren
tal for use of telephones.
The Central Club then nominated the
following committees to forward the elec
tion of the new bond Issue for the Park
Panhandle, sewers and schools:

Mayor Phelan delivered a brief address
on the desirability of beautifying the city.
His Honor stated that while schools and
sewers are necessary they can wait, as
they can be acquired any time, but every
day's delay In acquiring the Park exten
sion means an ultimate great expense to
the city.

of our population. Beautify the city and
you will get back our suburban residents
and gain Eastern Immigrants."

HAD HYSTERICS,
BUT DID NOT
TAKE POISON
Lizzie Kiesel Went
Into Convulsions.
NEARLY JUMPED OVERBOARD
TAKEN TO RECEIVING HOS
PITAL FOR TREATMENT.
â¦
Doctors Say That the Case Was a
Most Unusual One of Ex
treme Nervous Hys
teria.
Oakland Ofllce San Francisco Call,
â .'Â» Broadway, Dec. .11.
A lovers* quarrel sent Lizzie Ki-t*-l to
the Oakland Receiving Hospital last night
and according to the stories of Rome of
the passengers on the last boat from San
Francisco last night it came nearly send
ing her to death in the waters of San
Francisco Bay.
The story of. the strange actions of the
girl upon the boat and of her being taken
to the Oakland Receiving Hospital under
suspicion of having taken poison was
briefly told this morning, but the causes
that brought about that condition could
not be ascertained until the girl became
more composed. The physicians last
night thought that It was a I aSÂ« of poison,
self-inflicted, but after working upon her
It became evident that the girl Was suf
fering from a violent case of nervous hys
teria. She went from convulsion Into con
vulsion at the hospital, calling for her
brother and for Gilbert Bell, the man
whom she was with last night, and was
unable to tell anything coherent about
herself or others.
ThlH morning tho girl became more com
posed and toM the story of the Quarrel.
She had visited the home of Hell last
evening and there bad t n some difllculty
between the two over a man by the name
of Phillips, who seemed to creep into the
love affairs of the two. She was taken
to the last boat at lt:V by Bell, who pan
her on board. She began acting str
on the boat .md by the time ihe r
the Oakland pier sii>- waa i-i ronvu
and Policeman Agnews. who was on t lie
train, thought th;it poison h.id been titken.
This morning the Kirl snid thai abe bad
not taken powon, but ndmltted that there
had been a quarrel between herself and
Bell.
I >r. w s p rter lays that the ui n was
.1 run down In health and
that it was an extraordinary case
vous hysteria, probably supÂ» rlnduoed by
this lovers' mlaundei
Hell came to Oakland this morntne and
t".,k the girl to ht r home in Fru;
H<= refused to discuss the affair other
than to deny that the girl had
poison.
"She is only worn out from overwork.
said Bell, "and I am not going to d
the matt> r further."
Tiie quarrel must been s severe
one or it worked upon her w
badly, for several of the passengers on
the last boat, including Richard wil
\ Bernheim, ssy that sbe acted
she was Komi; to Jump overboard and she
was carefully watched for that reaSOaV

CHARGES OF PERJURY
SENSATION IN THE UKIAH
MILL DAM CASE.
Bitter Feeling Between Parties and
Lawyers and Innuendoes of Un
becoming Conduct.
Oakland Ofllce San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, l >â¢â -â . 11.
A mild sensation wife created this after
noon In the Milt of K. B. Zller against J.
W. Miller, U. m. Cameron and others,
which has been on trial before Judge Ells
worth for nearly two weeks. The action
was brought Against Miller and the sure
ties on his bond given as required by the
State as a guarantee that the contractor.
Miller, pay in full all the laborer! and
supply-men who rendered services in and
about the construction of the dam built
on MIU Creek for the Ikiah State insano
Asylum. The bond was In the sum of |lvÂ«)
and some of the laborer) and supply-men
assigned their claims to IS. B. Ziler, who
was foreman for Miller.
On the witness stand Miller had testified
that Z!ler never was employed by him
as foreman and this afternoon Attorney
Theodore J. Roche, arguing on behalf of
plaintiff severely commented on the man
ner in which the bond had bean drawn
up. pointing out many defects. He also
alluded to the fact that Attorney Fred L.
Krause had offered himself as a witness
for defendants, accusing him of conduct
at least unbecoming an attorney; and he
denounced Miller as a perjurer, stating
that even one witness for defense had
sworn positively that Miller's statement
to the effect that Zller had not been his
foreman was untrue.
Judge Ellsworth, from the bench, de
clared that he had no doubt as to /tier's
having been Miller's foreman and the
court left the inference that plaintiff
might get Judgment. The case, however,
was submitted for decision.

TAXES PAID UNDER PROTEST.
City May Use Moneys So Collected
for Municipal Purposes.
According to an opinion filed by Cltjr
Attorney l^ane with the Board of Super
visors, the moneys recently paid under
protest to the Tax Collector may be used
for municipal purposes and be apportion
ed to the various funds. The amount in
volved is over $300,000 and represents taxes
on bonds and other securities which As
sessor Dodge imposed on several corpo
rations and estates. The City Attorney
hold* that should thr money be decided
later to have been paid into the treasury
unlawfully It may be recovered by the
Judgment of the court. The pertinent
points In the opinion are as follows:
There lÂ» avtU|uÂ« la tbe law directing that
money paid under protest shall be held as
a sacred and separate fund awaiting de
termination of the validity of tne tax. â¢ On
the mntrary It seems to be the plain in
tendment OC the law thai once the money
nan paeoed Into the hands of the Tax Col
lector It â hall lost its Identity and become
ran of the general man of the public
funds.
M Â«*T paid under protest goes Into the
lueiilljf. and If later by Judgment of court
It Is determined that such money wa* paid
under an Invalid assessment the money may
be recovered by Judgment against the coun
ty Astd< tnu the Intrinsic evidence found
In the statute itself the policy of the law
requires that such construction be given to
this statute us will permit the use of all
j.atd for taxes without regard to the
manner In which they were paid. The

of any money paid under protest. All funds
coming Into his hands are alike and with

government for Its use*.
PARKS OF BOSTON.
Mayor Quincy Sends Important Data
to Mayor Phelan.
Mayor Phelan is in receipt of a letter
from Mayor Quincy of Boston relative to
park Improvements of that city. The let
ter is in reply to a telegram from Mayor
Phelan, asking for detailed information.
Mayor Quincy states that he is a strong
oelfever in the Judicious borrowing or
money for Important public Improve
ments. In conclusion he says:
Our park system represents an expenditure
of loans to the amount of nearly 113,000.000.
It Is worth much more than this, merely aÂ»
an asset to sell, and the Interest and sinking
funii requirements on park loans will not
â xcced the additional taxes already realized
through the effect of parks. I believe that
a good-slied municipal debt is necessary In
order to secure improvements of great value
|O future generations and that a city which
believes In Its own future should not hesi
tate to incur large loans for important Im
provementsâ though I am opposed to bor
rowing for anything that can be classed as
a current exjvenee.
Mayor Quincy also sent copies of the re
ports of the Boston Park Commissioners
for several years.
GOING BACK TO HER
OLD KENTUCKY HOME
MOTHER OF THE LATE CLAR
ENCE GREATHOUSE HERE.
Out of Regard for the Dead States
man the Emperor Delegates One
of His Household as Escort.
Staying at the Occidental, where she
arrived yesterday from the Orient, Is Mrs.
Elizabeth Greathou*e, mother of the late
Clarence Greathouse, at one time Consul
General of the United States at Yoko
hama and at the time of his death adviser
on foreign affairs to the Imperial court of
Korea.
Mrs Greathouse Is on her way back to
her home In Kentucky, where she expects
to pan the remainder of her life among
Meads and relative*:.
Clarence Greathouse was her only child,
and upon his death his mother, in obedi
ence to his last reouest, decldod to leave
ihe Orient w Ihtd she had passed so many
years with her child, and to k>> hack to
the land <>f her girlhood, forsaking the
Bast, where there were no longer any tics
to hold her.
When Mr. Greathouse was appointed to
the Consulship at Yokohama nis mother
accompanied him to his post and re
mained with him until he resigned and
moved to Korea to till the Important po
sition that had been offered him at court.
He made a success of his new pla
he had of the old one, and ftp Ingratiated
himself with the. Emperor that when he
died be was burled by order of the court
with full military honors, though his act
ual rank. hiK'.i in Importance as it was.
\ku.- officially only that of a civilian.
A- a.-* possible after her son s death,
which occurred Â»il>out two months ago,
Mrs. Qreathouse settled her affairs and. In
obedience to the wish of the dead states
man, start. -Â« 1 for her old home.
As a mark of courtesy to -his departed
friend and adviser, the Emperor appoint
ed B. W. Chanf, one of the gentlemen of
his household, to attend Mrs. Qreathouse
across the ocean to her Kentucky home
and offer her every courtesy on the trip.
Mr- Chang Is now with her at the Occi
dental, as is also a Korean boy, who was
by the Kmperor to act as the body
servant to the mother of his old compan
ion during her long journey to the United
States.
Mrs. Greathouse reports everything
quiet In the empire, though she says there
exists ;i Real feeling of uneasiness among
the people at the attitude of China, Japan
and Russia. It is the jealousy of those
three power!" that keeps the Emperor in
possession of his throne, though lie is so
circumscribed in his actions a* far as in
ternational policy la concerned as to be
j practically a prisoner.

DECLARE TURNER
VOWED HE WOULD
MURDER FRENNA
Witnesses Swear to
Hearing Threats.
DEFENDANT'S WIFE TESTIFIES
LAST OF THE EVIDENCE MAY
BE SUBMITTED TO-DAY.
Indications That the Weary Trial Is
Drawing to a Close â May Go
to the Jury To-Morrow
Afternoon.
The trial of J. P. Frenna. charged with
the murder of J. F. Turner, la drawing
to an end. and It is expected that the
examination of witnesses will be conclud
ed this afternoon. Another day ought to
suffice for the arguments of counsel, al
though there Is no telling when they will
Btop when they are once under way.
However, it is thought that the case will
be given to the Jury to-morrow night or
not later than Thursday, and then the
long trial, which h.us resembled anything
but a murder triul, will be over, barrlug
the verdict.
The proceedings underwent a kaleido
scopic change yesterday afternoon. The
seemingly t-ndle^s talk of deeds that were
not deeds, of whether the documents were
or were not Illuminated with red lines
drawn through the blank spaces, came
to an end at la*t, and then the defense
started in to convince the jury that Tur
ner had not only bunkoed Frenna out of
all his money and property but that he
had spent the la.Â«t year of his life- making
threats to take his life as well If Frenna
did not take his medicine philosophically
and cease to bother him.
Frenna was recalled to the stand when
court opened at iK.'W a. m., and on redirect
examination gave some further allege! ]
Information concerning his financial
transactions with the man he killed.
After the attorneys had finished with him
Frenna turned to Judge Cook ajid asked
permission to change some of his previous !
testimony. He then stated that he had I
been mistaken on Friday when he testi
fied that the bunch of twenty odd deeds
which he had transferred to Turner In |
1MÂ« had been in his possession several j
days after he had iLcknowledged his sig
nature to them. They had been acknowl
edged and taken away on the same day.
Frenna then left th<- stand.
A. H. McOallum, A. H Paul and C. K.
Gregory, Ji.lnt occupants of room 27,
Crycker building, followed each other on
the stand, but their testimony contained
nothing new and was simply corroborat
ive of certain not very material facts.
Tm examination of the tlrst named,
however, furnished an opportunity for a
little variation to the proceedings. He
had testified that when Prenna waa. being
MCOTted to his r<x.m by Mr. I'aul after I
th.- shooting he handed him (McCallum)
a letter and asked him to take care of it.
District Attorney Murphy remarked sar
eaMlcaly, in w hat was Intended to be a
whisper, to General Salomon: "I sup
pose that's evidence of Insanity."
Immediately Captain Barnen wheeled
around, and, calling the attention of the
court to the remark, demanded that the
record show that the District Attorney
had behaved improperly within the hear
ing of the Jury.
1 I heard It distinctly." he declared,
"and it was intended to reach the ears of
the Jury."
T. H. Curtis, brother-in-law of the de
fendant, was tho laM witness of the fore
noon, and he gavt- his testimony with the
air of a man who haÂ«l rapreme confidence
in th<> value of the little tale he had r>
unfold. The substance of his testimony
was to the effort that he had examined
the deeds, over which there has been the
greatest dispute, on a November after
noon In ISI'O in the dining room at Krt-n
na's house. Frenna and Mrs. Frenna
assisted In the examination, which was
made for the purpose of assuring them
selves that the documents were what they
purported to be. Curtis sw<>r<> that there
Cc no red lines on the deeds and that
â¢ did not. at that time, contain any
rence to the property in Sonoma and
sen counties.
His memory was sadly deficient on many
other subjects on which he might reaaor.
ably be supposed to be equally well In
fortned, but on everything that could be
used to strengthen the defense he was as
positive as though the events had hap
pened within the last twenty-four hours.
Mrs. Frenna. wife of the defendant, was
the first witness in the afternoon. She
was dressed all in black, and hor testi
mony was mainly in corroboratlon of that
given by her brother, although she was
equally weak in remembering anything
about the deeds aside from the absents of
red lines, and showing the state, of the
defendant's mind during the times he waa
having his trouble with Turner.
Bhe said that for months Frenna had
been unable to sleep nights and that
after the 17th of August he appeared to
be going out of his mind.
Mrs. Frenna was not subjected to a very
severe croÃs-examlniitlon. She was fol
lowed on the stand by Detective George
H. Graham, who testified that he arr*-Â«Â«t
ed Turner in July, 1595, at which time the
latter declared:
"This is persecution; If this ,
Frenna. don't stop persecuting me I'll
kill him." Graham had afterward told
Frenna of the threat and warned him to
look out for Turner.
Police Officer Chappelle testified that
Turner made a similar threat against
Frenna on October 21, 1898. when Chap
peiiÂ«- arrested h;m.
William J. Harrington, who accompa
nied Frenna to J. J. Rnuer's office on one
occasion, when several of the prosecu
tion's witnesses had testified that FrÂ»-n
na swore he would kill Turner, took the
stand and testified that Frenna had been
as mild ns a kitten on that occasion.
â¢â¢\\> went to Mr. Raver's office, and
Mr. Frenna asked a big. stout man
(Raver) if he could see those deeds. The
deeds were handed to him. We looked
them over, and Mr. Frenna called my
attention to the difference In the Ink and
the type of the two descriptions of prop
erty. He then handed the deeds back
and. thanking the stout gentleman, we
walked out."
"Did he make any threat of any kind
against Mr. Turner, asked Mr. Hosmer;
"didn't he threaten to kill Turner?"
"No, sir; there was not an ungentleman
ly word spoken while we were in tne
office " replied the witness before the
lUMrict Attorney could get In an objec-
Harrington was almost too accommo
dating or forgetful a witness to add
strength to the defense, as Frenna him
self nas admitted that h*Â» denounced
Turner on that occasion, although he has
denied making any threat to kill him. as
was but natural. The trial will go on at
9:30 o'clock this momlaff.
BULLETS RANGED DOWNWARD.
The testimony of Dr. J. L. Zabala,
which is of great Importance to the de
fense was given during the trial of
George L. Tanner for the murder of
James Brown and Fannie Barnes venter
day morning. The defense contends that
the murdered couple were shot when
Tannor was on the ground. hÂ» Id by the
throat *>> Brown, and Zabala. was ex
pected to prove this theory. Ho said that
the wounds on Brown's body were in thÂ»
region of tha nipple and coursed down
ward. It Is claimed that as Brown was
the tallest had both been standing thÂ»
bullets would have ranged upward and
this testimony the defense expects will
convince the jury that Brown was the
aggressor Louis Mllle. proprietor of the
house in which the tragedy occurred, was
Uie. next witness. His testimony simply
went to show the length of time the
couple occupied his rooms. The case goes
on to-day. _

under old Spanish grants. They knew
but little of Its possibilities and could not
foresee how their holdings must Increase
In value under the American occupation,
and I fear many of them got the short end
In the deals they made with the shrewder
Americans. I have heard that Rw-d wan
not altogether satisfied with the manner
in which he acquired some of his prop
erty. As a matter of fact. I have heard
sevt-ral people, especially since his death,
refer to the big legacy left to little De
Garcia and say that Re, d provided for
her in his will as an act of justice to the
girl and as a satisfaction to his own con
science. 1 never h*ard this from Reed
hlms-rlf. but it Ik not new to me and I am
inclined to believe it la the truth.
"I think Heed married a Spanish or a
Mexican lady, and no doubt he had much
dealing with the race, though I cannot
say that I am acquainted with the details
of any of his transactions. I do not place
any credence In the story that Rood led
a dual life and that little De Garcia is a
relative of his. What â¢â â¢ ms to substan
tiate the statement that Reed's legacy to
the girl is an act of restitution is another
fact -.'hJi-h I understand to be true that
there will be no contest to the distribu
tion of the estate, in accordance with the
terms of the will. If there were anything
doubtful about the relationship Â»>f Reed
and the '.â¢ Garcia child it is hardly likely
that the son would let her have so large
a share of the property without protest."
Mrs. de Garcia was In consultation with
her attorneys yesterday and the plan of
action waÂ» discussed. There was virtu
ally no plan decided upon, for the attor
neys for the little hf.ln-ss will make no
move until the other Fide has shown it*
hand. Any >ign of a contest must come
from the family of the testator, for the
child's attorneys are satisfied with the
will ns it is. The case will come up be
fore the Matin County court on January 2.

of D. M. Burns have not signed, but the
extra-session managers assume that their
signatures ti the caucus call at the regu
lar session last winter constitute all that
ils now required. The last information ob-
I tamable is to the effect that Judge Dibble
j holds the document signed last winter
and there Is suspicion that ho may hold It

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 12. 1899.
MRS. DE GARCIA, MOTHER OF REED'S LEGATEE.
untll he Is convinced that thirteen of
the new signers will enter the Hums
camp.
Governor Gage Is not possessed of an
overstock of political sagacity, but he
will surely insist that Burns' thirty shall
pledge themselves to adjourn when the
Governor dÂ«tÂ»lren adjournment. The cau
cus signers other than those in the Hums
camp have accepted the adjournment
condition. Such condition was not ap
pended to the caucus agreement of the
last session.
There is a lurking suspicion that the
Hums men will hedge and back out when
they apprehend that the anti-boss mem
bers 01 the Legislature are In a fair way
late personal unpleasantness, they
shed thrlr coats and Joined hands In
the greatest "brother" act ever seen
In San Francisco. They worked day
time, nighttime and overtime.
Everybody knows the result. The
public figured that the player f"lk
would add n couple of thousand dol
lars to the reception fund. The man
agers thought that by good luck they
might reach the five thousand mark.
The actuality staggered everybody and
a ebeck for more than Itt.QM was
turned in to the finance committee.
That's the Hurt of stuff the theatri
cal managers of San Francisco am
man- of. and n is also On- material of
which their player folk are Conned.
Nothing In Rnn Francisco should be
too good for such people. At any rate,
any number of people have said so.
It will soon be seen whether or not
this was mere lip servi' â¢â¢â¢
For, 10, these many years â so many
that it Is too much trouble to figure
outâ the theatrical people of San Fran-
to rally a sufficient number of votes to
control the caucus.
There would be less suspicion of Jur-
Ullng and Â»harp practice If the extra-ses
slon manipulators would come out frank
ly and declare that the caucus agreement
of last winter Phall not go for \he pro
posed extra session. The signatures of
the Burns men should not bo counted
until they Individually sign the pledge to
go Into caucus, abide by the caucus, nomi
nee and adjourn when the Governor de
cires adjournment.
The Burns men want an extra session
If they can get a majority of Republicans
pledged In advance to support Burns,
when Governor Gage holds another In
terview with Mr. Miller the suggestion
may be made to the Assemblyman that
the old caucus agreement will not be con
sidered It appears that the deal Is now
up to Dibble's thirty.

COAST JOBBERS ARE
SUPPORTED BY EAST
Talked With Merchants and Manu
facturers, Who Wished to Know
How They Could Furnish
Their Assistance.
"Wakefield Baker, president of the Pa
cific Coast Jobbers' and Manufacturers'
Association, yesterday came home from
an extended tour through the East. He
put In a good part of his time abroad in
working for the Rood of the association
and the cause that the association repre
sents. He found the people of the At
lantic coast fully aware of the situation
and of the common Interest that exists
between the Pacific and the Atlantic
coasts In the matter of graded rates. . â¢Â«
"I visited many cities In the East and
talked with a great number of merchants
and manufacturers who do business on
the Pacific Coast," said Mr. Baker, "and
without an exception I found those on
the Atlantic coast with whom I talked
In entire accord with and fully under
standing our position. They frequently
asked what they could do to help us in
the fight that we are making against the
plans of the Middle West Jobbers. I
think that the moral influence will be
felt in behalf of our contention, and they
will do all that they can. The success
of the association la a bobby with me :
and I naturally talked about our work
a great deal."
Eastern associations of business men
have already written through their rep
resentatives that they, oppose the graded
rate proposition which the St. Louis Job
bers urge.
Mr. Baker said he thought that the In
terstate Commerce Commission, after the
hearing to take place In this city soon,
would be adjourned to the national capi
tal for the taking of rebuttal testimony
and the general winding up of the hear
ing. Such has been the custom of the
commission, and there was no reason to
expect that there would be a departure
from it In the present instance. Imme-
clsoo have nsked nothing from the
people of the city. On the contrary,
they have given much. It would seem
to be pretty near time to begin even-
Ing up.
The first opportunity. Is at hand.
For the lirst time In many a long day
the mar.ai;--rs have Invited the public
to lend a hand. They have arranged
a benefit performance in aid of a fund
f>r sick and destitute actors. It will
take place at the Orpheum this com
ing Thursday afternoon, December 14.
The programme is so full that It stag

in variety even that offered at the
great volunteer benefitâ and that's
saying a good deal All you are asked
to <io |a to pay prloes ns low as the
pit to s<-e a performance that hiti the
ceiling.
The best seat In the house is a pal
try dollar. From it you can Bee the
cream of the performance of every one
of the nine playhouses of the city.
Managers Belasco and Thall of the
dlately after Mr. Baker arrived he had
a conference with Attorney l'lllsbury.
who represents the Pacific Coast Jobbers'
and Manufacturers' Association In a legal
capacity. The situation was thoroughly
discussed, and Mr. linker was Informed
what has been done since the adjourn
ment of the hearing from St. Louis to
this city. Traffic Manager Lovcland has
been almost dally In consultation with
Mr. Plllabury and the case Is being pre
pared for the meeting of the commission.
There is now some doubt when the com
mission will sit here. It may not pos
sibly be here before March, although the
general expectation is that the meeting
will open next month and continue about
ten days.
