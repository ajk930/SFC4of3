Corpse of Free Silver and Candidly
Thinks It Will keep Till the Next \

WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN*
of Nebraska has personally
delivered his message to the
people of this city. He had
his say last night at Wood
ward's Pavilion, and what he said was
against territorial expansion and the
tru?ts and in favor of free silver, the
election of United States Senators by a
direct vote of the people, axid the in
come tax. A great throng of people
listened to and applauded his words.
and another great crowd lingered out
side, unable to gain admittance into the
big building.
The late standard-bearer cf the sil
ver Democracy, who still appears to
ha%-e the call on the Democratic nomi
nation for the Presidency, arrived in
San Francisco yesterday mominz from
the Ycsemite, where he has been sisht
see'.ng with his family. Mrs. Bryan.
his son and two daughters accompanied
him. They were taken to the Califor
nia Hotel, in the parlors of which, after
luncheon, the Nebraskan and his wife
held a reception. Later in the day they
were driven to the Mechanics" Fair.
After dinner, in company with the
members of the reception committee
and escorted by marching clubs and
bands of mu?ic, they began the carriage
Journey to "Woodward's Pavilion.
The crowds were there long ahead of
them. So were the police from the
Seventeenth-street station, under com
mand of Captain Glllln. to keeo the
crowds in order, which they did so ad
mirably that the 5000 seats in the Inte
rior, except those reserved for the es
cort marching with Bryan, were filled
without discomfort to any one â if you
don't count those that couldn't get in â
in tore S o'clock.
The pavilion itself was decked out in
more artistic fashion than ever before, |
th= management evidently having
profited by the recent examale fur
nished during th a reception of the Cali
fornia volunteers. Red. white and blue
bunting was draped ail around in
srrncer'u! festoons from rafters to gal
leries, the effect being punctuated here
and there with pictures of Bryan and
silver stars. A tribune erÂ«-tM at the
south end of the platform was very
beautif':! in red plush and a stand of
colors. Above it in larce letters hung
the legend, indicative of the burden of
the speech about to be delivered â
Republic or Empire?
At S o'clock the doors were barred
and the crowd settled town to await
the coming of the speaker, being aided
thereto by the band over the speaker's
stand, which persisted in playing
"Only One!" which many thought to.be
a ?uÂ£-grsti<->n of the unit 5n the free
silver ratio. A few minutes after 8
o'clock Mrs. Phebe Hearst and the
visiting architects who are her guests
'.v-r* 1 ushered into the pavilion. They
w*r= immediately recognized and
cheered.
The progress of the Nebraskan and
his escort through the streets of the
city took longer than had been calcu
lated, and it was almost 5 o'clock when
the strains of approaching music gave
notice of their proximity to the pa
vilion. Outside bombs were, fired and j
cheers raised; inside everybody rose j
to his <">r her feet and got ready to ;
cheer. The scenes that ensued during >
the next five minutes changed too rap- >
Idly to be caught by any one eye. the ;
sounds were too many for any one ear
to distinguish.
Pellrcell through one of the big doors â 
came the white-uniformed men of the
Bryan Free Silver Flambeau Club and
their band. Everybody cheered and the ;
f.ambeau bearers made a wild scram
ble for the 3eats that had been reserved
:^r them to the right or the speaker's
stand, the crowd that followed almost
beating them to the coveted places, i
Next came the Iroquois braves, some ;
r,i them in war paint, with another j
bar.d. More cheers, another crowd,
again a rush for seats. Necks were :
Etret<~hM farther and eyes popped for l
the fir*: glimpse of Bryan. When he
did come, which was not for several |
minutes later, he was met by a shout j
that shook the building. There was i
not a doubt of it: He was in the house i
of his friends and the glad smile that
overspread his features showed that the j
Nebraskan appreciated the situation.
Mr. Bryan came in on the arm of
Democratic National Committeeman J. j
J. Dwyer. Following came Mrs. Bryan j
on the- arm <-.f i^ o Park, others in the I
party which ascended to the speaker's i
stand were Mayor Pheian, Seth Mann, i
chairman of the Democratic State Com- j
mittee: Judge W. j. Lawler, Mrs. Park,
the Misses Dwyer. W. EL Alford, W. j
W. Foote and Jasper McDonald.
As soon as the cheering ceased the j
committee in charge made up for lost |
time by getting into the* middle of J
things. Mr. Dwyer wasted few words
In Introducing as chairman of the even- !
ing Seth Mann. The chairman of the j
Democratic State Central Committee i
used only a few more in welcomine the
Nebraskan. whose name was loudly
cheered again and again. Mr. Mann
said y the late candidate of the Demo
cratic party for President of the United
State was still the logical candidate,
and would undoubtedly be elected at !
the coming election. He then Intro- j
duced "William Jennings Bryan, the i
next President of the United States." '
The San Francisco Call.
Mr. Bryan st^od up. and. of course.
there were more cheers, and prolonged
ones, during which the big: audience
had opportunity for a good look at the
champion of free silver. Since his las:
visit here the Nebraskar. has taken or.
more fiesh. The firmly defined jaw of
the once "Boy Orator of the Platte"' !
has accumulated a good full coatine of ;
flesh; the nose is not so sharply defined
as it was in ISSS, when he first came to
this coast. There is more erectness.of .
b-arir.g, however, that there was before
the war, probably due to service as coi
onel of a Nebraska regiment. There
was fire in the eye. but it was not no
ticeable until the speaker warmed up.
and, no matter how he stirred his hear- ; '
ers, Mr. Bryan kept himself always
well in hani. I
Bryan Says Imperialism Cannot Exist Without Its Twin Brother, Militarism.
Judging from his address last night,
Mr. Bryan is a finished orator. Every
word he utters is clearly articulated;
he wastf-s no energy in meaningless
gestures; he speaks in the tone of c.
man who believes what he says, and
his manner cannot fail to convince such
an audience as he had last night â polit
ical friends all. or nearly all.
He started with the statement that
he believed the nation was assailed by
creat dangers and proceeded to point
out v.hat he believed these to be. He
denounced the system of stamp taxa
tion and advocated the income tax.
When he had finished with that he in
sisted that United States Senators
should be elected by direct vote of the
people.
"You had a Senatorial contest here
recently. I believe." he said, with a
smile.
The house caught on and Mr. Bryan
did not think it necessary to continue
his argument further.
On the silver question he * said he
hated to drag in such a funereal sub
ject, but was compelled to. The Re
publicans, he continued, said it was a
dead issue and that they had buried it.
"They have buried it so often." he
said, "that they confess that they have
never done a good job. I have ex
amined the so-called corpse and my
candid opinion Is that it will last till
l&OO."
The "benevolent assimilation of the
Filipinos," as he called the territorial
expansion policy, came in for a good
many sly digs at the hands of the Ne
braskac He said coupled with It -was

At the pavilion the Nebraskan received an ovation. He outlined the issues upon which
Democracy would base its claims for success in the next Presidential election, 'denounced the pol
icy of expansion and trusts, denied ... silver was a corpse, and said he favored the income tax
and the election of United States Senators by direct vote of the people.
Colonel and Mrs. Bryan and members of their party took supper at the Palace Hotel, after
leaving ward's Pavilion, as the guests of Mrs. Phebe Hearst. Mr. and Mrs. Bryan will
leave this morning for Sacramento, where Colonel Bryan will deliver an address to-day.
The prominence, of Colonel IV. IV. Ftfote in the ... is causing some uneasiness to
local Democratic politicians. Since the advent of the Nebraskan in the State the colonel of the
Paris Commission has been constantly at his side, and the impression is gaining ground that,
should Presidential lightning ever strike William Jennings Bryan Colonel Foote will be the man in
this neck of the woods whom hais will have to come off.
the doctrine of forcible Christianity,
which would shoot the gospel Into the j
refractory with a Gatling. For a full
half-hoar he-<welt on the subject, ad
vancing many new â some of them very
humorous â ideas, why from his stand- ;
point the policy of expansion was un-
American.
The trusts came in for some bitter i
denunciation at the hands of Mr.
Bryan, who received a great ovation j
as he finished. The speech, which oc- ;
cupied full two hours in delivery, was j
as follows:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentle- |
men: While I appreciate the kindly !
words used by Mr. Mann in presenting j
me to you, I want you to believe me I
when I say that I have a higher ambi
tion than to be President of the United
States. (Cheers.) Only a few car. be
President in a generation, but in this
nation, where we are taught to love
the principles set forth by the fathers;
in this nation where every citizen is a
sovereign, and where none cares or
dares to wear a crown, to be a citizen i
is honor enough without holding any :
office. State or municipal. (Cheers.)
A higher ambition than to be Presi
dent is the ambition to make American
citizenship stand for something more â 
than citizenship in any other country
stands for. (Applause.) And I shall
have done all that I hope to do If I
can have a humble part In the work ;
of carrying this Government back and
placing it upon the old foundations, j
and make it what Jefferson intended: ;
a government that recognizes as its ,
maxim, "equal rights to all and special
privileges to none." (Applause and.
cheers.) .
My ambition will be fully satisfied '
if I can have a humble part in the
work of making this nation what Lin
coln wanted it to be a Government of
the people, by the people and for the
people. (Applause.)
I believe that the nation is assailed
by grave dangers and that it is the
duty of the citizen, the duty of every
lover of his country, to first investigate
and then cast his influence upon the
right side of every public question.
The Campaign of 1896.
The campaign of l?St> was a campaign
that stimulated thought and investiga
tion, and though the forces to which I
allied myself went down in defeat. I
believe that that campaign did good,
because it taught the people to study
public questions and the study of pub
lic questions must ultimately result Ii
the triumph of every right principle
and every *good policy. (Applause.)
There are Republicans in this audience,
I doubt notâ there are Republicans I
hope; and they no doubt rejoiced that
In the campaign of 1596 they helped to
defeat me when I was a candidate for
the Presidency. But I want to tell them
that if the triumph of the Republican
party proves to be good for this coun
try I shall rejoice as much as the most
ardent Republican in my defeat. (Great
cheering.) And if the triumph of the
Republicans proves hurtful to this
country I shall expect the Republicans
who were responsible for that triumph
to feel worse about the result of the
last election than I feel. (Applause.)
I am going to assume that I have In
this audience to-night people who pre
fer the .triumph of that which is right
to the triumph of that which they may
think to be right; the triumph of that
which is true to the triumpÃ of that
which to them may seem to be true.
&cd I want to present to you a. few of
the Issues, and give you my reasons |
for believing that the Republican party j
is wrong on every great question now
before the country. (Applause.) Wrong
because there Is "a vicious principle
that runs through every Republican
policy; and I am going to try to con
vince you not only that there is a prin- ;
ciple running through all the Repub
lican parties, but I am going to try to
convince you that it is a vicious prin- !
ciple, and I have such faith in the i
strength of the arguments that I shall j
employ that I am confident I shall be â¢
able to convince some of you of that j
fact, some of you who have not ad
mitted it before.
The Dollar Above the Man.
The Republican party is putting the
dollar above the man. (Cheers and
cries of "That is true.") The Republi
can party has enthroned money and
debased mankind, and you can see the
dollar mark stamped on every policy
of the Republican party.
Abraham Lincoln â wrote a letter in
1559 to the Republicans of Boston, who
were engaged in the celebration of Jef
ferson's birthday. Think: of it! Re
publicans celebrating Jefferson's birth
day. But they did it in 1868 To-day
they tell you that Alexander Hamilton
is the man whom Republicans worship,
but in 1559 the Republicans invoked the
name of Thomas Jefferson, not the
name of Alexander Hamilton. And
when Abraham Lincoln could not at
tend that dinner he sent a letter of re
gret and in the letter paid to Thomas
Jefferson a tribute as eulogistic as any
that I can pay. and in the course of
that letter he said that the Republi
can party believed In the man and the
dollar, but that in c%se of conflict it
believed In the man above the dollar.

The Nebrasken Declares Himself
an Out-and-Out Opponent of
the Policy of Expansion.
is Emphatic in His Assertion That the
Gospel of Benevolent Assimulation
Cannot Be Shot Into Filipinos With a
Gatling Gun.
That was the doctrine of Abraham I
Lincoln, and in the early days of h\< -,
: administration he sent to Congress a
â  message, and in that message he
\ warned his countrymen against the ap-
I proa of monarchy. What alarmed
him, he stated in the message â what it :
was that gave him alarm â was the at- :
i tempt to put capital upon an equal
; footing, if not above, labor in the
Structure of the government, and in
I that attempt he saw the danger of re-
I turning monarchy.
If I were to warn the people to-day
: against the approach of monarchy
I they would call me a demagogue â the
i Republicans wouldâ and yet Abraham .
i Lincoln warned his countrymen :
' against the approach of monarchy, and ;
\ he was frightened at the attempt, then
1 in its inception, to place capital even j
upon an equal footing with labor in
the structure of the government.
Lincoln Versus Hanna.
If Lincoln mas alarmed then, what
would be his alarm if he were here to
day and could see the difference be
tween Republicanism in the days of
Lincoln and Republicanism In the days
of Marcus A. Hanna? (Prolonged
cheers a_d applause.)
I: you Republicans want to get a
good view of the change that has
taken place in the Republican party
place the heroic fisure of your mar
tyred President at one end of the Re
publican party and the present chair
man of the Republican National Com
mittee at the other end. and look at the
toboggan slide that leads to the bot
tom. (Great applause.)
I repeat that to-day the Republican
party has reversed the doctrine of Lin
coln, and that to-day in the eyes of the
Republican leaders the dollar comes
Srst and the man afterward, if at all.
(Laughter and applause.) You ask me
how I can prove it. If I had time I
could take up one by one the issues be
fore the country and show you that in
every instance the Republican party
sides with money as against man.
(Cries of "Take them up.")
Platform of 1900.
The Democratic platform of IS3S -will
be in the campaign of 1900, every plank
of it. (Cheers and applause.) Every
plank, every line, and every syllable,
and every plank is stronger to-day
than it was when written. Do you
doubt that the demand for arbitration
of differences between labor and capi
tal is stronger to-day than it was in
ISSS? I believe it is stronger, much
stronger, now. and that the demand
for arbitration will continue to grow
MrrJ.l â â  ihi arbitration of disputes be-
PRICE Tl\'E CENTS.
I tvreen rporai capita! and employes
I of corporations will be as well system
atized and as practicable as is the
court of justice to-day for the settle-
I meet or" disputes between man and
man. Do you doubt that there is more
. opposition to-day to government by in
: junction than there was in 1536? (Ap
plause.) I have no doubt of it. and :
believe that opposition to govern
ment by injunction will continue to in
crease until the people of this nation,
; acting through the constitution and the
laws, will make it impossible for courts
[ to take away from people accused Of
â  crime the right of trial by jury to de
: tennice their guilt or innocence. (Ap
: plause.)
Income Tax a Stayer.
The income tax was in the campaign
| of ISSS, and it had a good deal of influ
ence with some people. Why, when we
had that amendment before Congress
one of the Eastern Democrats said to
: us in the committee that if we, as a
'â â  party, favored the income tax rich
: Democrats would leave the party. I
: felt it my duty tcr defend the rich Demo
crat, and I said they would not; that
no rich Democrat would leave the party
because of the party's efforts to do
justice on the subject of taxation. I
say that I said the rich Democrats
would not leave the party, but I did
not know rich Democrats then as well
as I did afterward. (Laughter and ap
plause.) But I said, "Suppose they do,
won't the poor Republicans come in
and take their places?" I thought they
would; but I did not know the poor
Republicans then as well as I did
afterward. (.Laughter and applause.)
I thought that M a rich Democrat
left the party in order to avoid doing
justice, poor Republicans would
; come into the party to secure justice. I
â  thought the poor Republicans would
j feel about the matter as the Irishman
I felt about the action of the mule. He
I was driving a mute-to a buggy and the
! male began to kick, and finally got his
; heels up over the dashboard, and the
: Irishman said to the muie: "All right,
you can get In if you want to, but
â when you get in I will get out. (Laugh
ter and applause.)
But I can forgive the poor Republi
cans who were so blinded by partisan
prejudice that they did not realize that
the Democratic party was fighting their
battles for them. I knew that a man
can be blinded by partisanship so that
he will think that everything his own
party does is ail right, and that every
thing any other party does is ail wrong.
I went once from my home in Nebras
ka to a town in Eastern lowa to hear
a great Republican make a speech. I
wanted to hear what could be said on
that side, and I wanted to hear it from
the lips of one of the great Republi
cans. ~ I remember the meeting. They
had a good many Republican farmers
there.
Cornstalk Applause.
It was in the fall of the year and
the Republican farmers had with them
---â â . canes, and they would wave
them when anything was said that
pleased them. I remember that when
the speaker pointed out that the Re
publican party had put a tariff on wool
in order to raise the price of wool, those
Republican farmers waved their corn
stalk canes and hurrahed for a tariff on
wool which raised the price of wooL
And that when the speaker went on to
say that the Republican party had put
a tariff on woolen goods in order to
lower the price of woolen goods, those
men raised their canes a?ain and
shouted. (Cheers and laughter.) â¢ I be
lieve that it did not make any differ
ence what the argument was. (Lauzh
ter.)
I say I can forgive the poor Republi
can who don't understand how unjust
is the present method of collecting
i taxes, but I want to warn the poor Re
: publicans that my forgiving power will
. not hold out much longer if they fail to
', see it. (Laughter.)
In the campaign of 1536, when I rant
ed to say anything on the income-tax
decision I always quoted from one of
1 the Judges of the Supreme Court, and
I am such a conservative man. and so
cautious, that I always preferred to
quote from a Republican Judge rather
than a Democratic Judge, because he
could" not be an anarchist. (Laush
ter and applause.) I used to quote es
pecially from Justice Brown of Mich
igan. You remember that he said in his
dissenting opinion: "I fear that in
some hour of national peril this de
cision will rise up to paralyze the arm
of the Government." The hour of Deril
came. We needed more revenue. We
could not collect that increased revenue
from incomes. Why? Because that de
cision Lid rise up to paralyze the arm
of the Government, and then we had
to resort to other methods of taxation.
We have become familiar with the
stamp tax.
Working of Stamp Tax.
Every time you send a telegram you
pay what you used to pay and in addi
tion thereto 1 cent for tie benevolent
assimilation of the Filipino. Way is it
that that tax of 1 cent on each telearram
must be paid by the sender? It is be
cause the telegraph companies have
more influence with the Republican
party than all the poor Republicans who
send telegrams and must pay that tax.
You go to a bank and give a check, and
if you are a poor man and give a small
check you pay - cents on it. If you are
rich and give a check you pay only 2
cents on it. The tax is not graded ac
cording to income or wealth of the
citizen I believe in the income tax. and
I believe that it is the fairest tax that
was ever devised. (Applause and
cheers.) I intend to continue to labor
for an income tax, and I am so san
guine that I expect to see the day when
the constitution of the United States
will specifically authorize an income
tax. so that neither one Judge nor nine
Judges can build a bulwark around the
fortunes of the great nor place a bur
den upon the backs of the struggling
poor. (Applause and cheers.)
Blood Not as Precious as Money.
The war has broueht into bold relief2
thifi fact, thai when our Government
deals with the citizen ;t.- : power is iin
limited, but when it deals with prop
erty its power is limited. Under our
present coi dltl ma i nd vi der Repub
lican rule, blood Is not as precious as
money. The Government can drafi the
citizen but cannot draft thy pocket
book.
In an hour f peril the Government
can take the son from his mother, nÂ«>
matter hÂ»>w much she needs him; in
an hour of peril the Government can
take the husband from his wife, no
matter bow much she needs him; in
an hour Â«'f peril tho Government can
take the father from the children no
matter how much they need him; In
an hour of peril the Government can
take the son, brother, father, the hus
band and stand them up In front of the
enemies' guns. Hut in fin hour of peril
this Government is powerless to lay its
finger upon accumulated wealth ami
make that wealth bear its share of the
burdens of war. (Prolonged cheers and
se.)
Why is it? It is because the Repub
lican party is putting the dollar ab ive
the man, and it is giving to aggregate
wealth an Influence over the destinies
of the nation and every policy ><i the
Government more potent than it gives
to i! oon people of this
: ry.
Corporations Make Senators.
Bui that is 6nly one question. I am
not sure but you had a Senatorial con
test In this State recently. (Laughter
and applause.) The Fifty-second Con- |
gress and the Fifty-third C
were Democratic congresses and
congresses passed through tho
lower h iuse by more than a two-thirds
vote a resolution submitting to the
an amendment to the constitu
ti n pi oviding for the election of I fnited
ators bj a din ct voi e of tho
I c, (Applause.) There have been
Repub n congress< s since and
neither of those congresses passed such
lution. Why. Because under the
present method of electing Senators
corporations can elect Senators to rep
resent corporations instead of the peo
: the State. (< 'hi crs. i And the
n party <:â >â¢ s not advance
that measure which is in the Ini
of thi : d desired by them. The
ators by the peopli Ihe
Republican party does noH advance be
lt is < . by â  'n 'rate
\\ ealth and da i fuse to do the
bidding of these great corporations. In
another instanci you see the Repub
lican party is putting the dollar al
an and insisting upon the reten
tion of a method of electing Senators
permits money t<> elect Instead of
the people. It is putting the dollar
above the man. (Applause.)
A Procession of Funerals.
There Is another question that I al
hate to mention before this on- I
thuslastlc audience for< v â 
that seems to be so good-natured. I
hate to drag in a fui tion be
: such an audience, and yet I must
speak of the silver question. (Laughter
and .!â  â  1 must speak for a lit
hile, even If it is not welcome.
(Applaus< I They say that the silver
. â¢ : >n is dead. < Laughter.) Well,
my friends, tin- fact is that the gold
has buriÂ« 1 it so often that a fun- [
has lost all its terrors, and
have come almost to exclaim, in the
language, "O death, where is thy
Is thy victorj ?
(Laughter.) 1 remember that In WJ
my opponent for Congress said v. â¢
would never hear of the silver q
tion after that election. It was
lhan-a year from that time when th<
lent called C< tigress together to
â  Mian law, and buried it
again. When the Sherman law was
Lied they s.iid that it was buried
again, but it was up In 1*1'!, and had to
be buried again, and some of you prob
ably remembei that it was up again |
in 1896. (Laughter and applause.) Bui
the Republicans said that they had
buried it again. 1 remember reading
aboul thai myself; it was in large
print. (Laughter.) Thin it was up
aguln In 1897 and had to be buried
again. It had to be buried again in j
1898, and if you will read the Repub
rs you will find that the ob
sequies are still in progress. I have
examined very carefully this corpse
and my candid opinion is that it will !
last until 1900. (Laughter ami an
plause.)
i why is it that they have '<<â¢ bury
it so often? Why don't they bury it
completely and be done with it? Be
no tomb was ever made so strong
that it could imprison a righi'
(Applause.) I am not going t .
Into a discussion of this question,
but I am going to call your attention
to a few f.-iets of history and then I
on. Why, you hear people talk us If
â  :-â¢ was something new. They
hold up their hands in horror at the
thought of trying to experiment. The
! that we had the double standard
for eifchty-one years in this country.
from 1792 to 1873, and during all thai
time no party, whatever the name, ever
declared against it. Isn't that strange?!
What a record! Now, I heai people
say that we never bad the double i
dard at all: that bimetallism was never
11 was something else. I never
quarrel with them. When a man tplls;
me that we never had the double Btan-
Ilism I simply reply to
him, "Give us what you had. and you

that strange? Tell ni" the gold standard
Is a blessing, and 1 ask you why is it liiat
that blessing was bo mysteriously con

not one of them was intimidated. (Ap
plause and cheers.) You tell me that the I
Republicans outvoted us and I tell you j
that according* to the returns they had
millions of votes, but for what did j
those seven millions vote? "Why," you 1
say, "they voted the Republican ticket." j
Bat that ticket ran upon a platform, and
what did that platform say? That plat
form pledged the Republican party to do
what it could to get rid of the gold stand
ard by International agreement, and when j
the vote was counted thirteen millions and
a half of people had voted for and pledged
themselves to a double standard as
against the gold standard, and only one i
hundred and thlrtyHwo thousajuiâ less i
than one per cent of the voters of the |
: Statesâ had supported the only i
liikit that was ever pledged to the gold
standard as a good thing in the United i
States. (Applause.)
Getting Bid of a Blessing.
Now, the first thing the Republican !
President did was to send a commission
of thne distinguished men all the way to
Europe to get rid of the gold standard.
You tell me that the gold standard is a
blessing? i cannot believe it. becausi i
have so much c mfldence in the judgment :
President McKinley that I don't think
he would send three men all tho way to j
Europe to get rid of a good thing. (Ap
plause ami laughter.) And even if I was
willing to doubt the judgment of the Pres
l am not Injudicious enough to!
bring an Indictment against the whole
Republican Congress, because a Repub
lican Congress appropriated $100,000 to pay
xpenses of the commission while it
was in Europe trying to get rid of the gold
standard; rind I know that Republican
Congressmen are so careful of the peo- i
pie's money that they would not vot
â  of it trying to get rid of a
blessing. :
The commission went to Europe and it
found France anxious to Join with us-.wa,
France sent an Bmbassador to act with
.: Commissioners and tried to prevail mi
the English Government to help us out of
the hole that the gold star.. lard had put us
into. When our Commissioners went to i
tnd they found a sentiment there.-
They found that the labor organizations
. El gland had joined in a petition to rlu>
English Government asking that Govern
ment to assist In the restoration of bi
metallism. Why did the laboring men of
England Join In that petition. Because
th( gold standard has been a curse to the)
laboring men of England. (Applause.)
And while our commission was there
an English commission appointed to in
vestigate and report on the condition of
agriculture reported by a vote of 10 to i
that the gold standard was the
isi of agricultural depression in Eng- ,
and pointed to bimetallism as the;
only hope of the English farmer. Why
do the farmers of England cry out against j
. ild standard? Because it has b^en
ree to them. But you tell me that
the English Government refuses to join ,
with us. That is true. Hut why? Be- |

the Republican party is controlling the j

Money Question Not Dead.
You tell me that the money question is
dead. I tell you that It requires more
than a handful of English bankers to kill
a question in which 70.000,000 of people are
sted. You Republicans called me j
hard names in ': : '.. You called me a dem
le and a disturber of the peace. Aye,
even an anarchist. I want to toll you
you cannot think* of a name so bard that!
by using it you prevent me doing what j

domination in Cuba .
Bimetallism Still Desirable.
But they say that things hay. happened
since the election. Well, my friends, if j
â¢ happened since the election to
the gold standard satisfactory it is
strange that the authorities at Washing-'
not found out about it. If you
will read the testimony givt n lately before
an English commission you will find in ;
that testimony, now published and open to
all, a letter written by John Hay, Secre
tary of State, on the 25th day of last .No
vember to a director of the Hank of Eng-
That letter was written by Mr. Hay
more than two years after the last Presi
: election. It was written more than
two weeks after the last Congressional
election, and yet that letter says that,
the President and the majority of his
Cabinet still believe in the great desira
bility of an international agreement for j
the restoration of silver. "Still be- (
that bimetallism Is de- j
c." Every argument in favor of In
ternational bimetallism is an argument
against the gold standard, and if the gold
ird is satisfactory, why doesn't the
: lent announce to the prop!.- of the j
< lid World that we no longer want fnter
bimetallism; that we want the
gold standard? Jnst as long as a man i
argues In favor of International bimetal- j
!is!n he confesses that it.'- gold standard
is not satisfactory. But they say that!
we have had a discovery of gold in the '
:ike. Republicans, you are awful
hard up for a vindication of your conduct |
â  to have to point to something that
happened after th>- election that you did
spect, in order to prove that you â 
were wise In what you did before that '
. happened. But did this discovery
of more gold vindicate the gold standard?
Not at all. What was the advantage of
cry of more gold? Why, you
say, it gave us more money. Ah: You
don't dare admit that, because if the dls
eovery of more gold gives us more money,
and mor< money gives us better times,
then you admit the quantitative theory of
money. That is what you denied in 1896.
*> . v said it did not make any difference
how much or how little just so it was all
quality and not the quantity.
You tell me that we had a famine in i
,and that we exported bread
al a high price, and that brought
In much money, what good did that do?
Wii. , you Bay, "It gives us morn m
and bette r times." STou dare not admit
it. bicai.se if the importation of more
mom y from Europe gives us a larger
. â â¢ion and better times you admit
thai the quantitative theory ii correct, and I
if you mi. â¢â  admit that the quantitative
theory of money is correct that more
money mr-ans b<-tt<-r times then we pro
pose that Instead of waiting for the dis
covers of un< xjiocted gold. Instead of i
waiting for a. famine abroad to gfvÂ« us I
more money, we propose that you open'
tb.e mints of the nation and allow your !
own sttver to pour- Into them and be I
money, and therefore have more money.
(Applause and cheers.)
Hut of all people the people of SÂ«n
Francisco have the least reason to deny
the quantitative Hieory of money. Your!
gold bugs, your bankers and financiers
told the people in 1596 that it did riot mat
t. r rehether yon had much money or
money, just so it was all good.
They tell us in the Mississippi Valley
that the people of San Francisco are will
ing to change their form of government
in order to have an army here and there
fore have more money spent hi San Fran
cisco (Applause.) xou cannot justify an
army camp In your rieighborhood on ttirÂ» ;'
.. that It gives you more money hero,
without admitting the quantitative theory
of money as correct. And if you believe ,
that the quantitative theory of money is
correct. Instead of running rho risk of.
militarismâ lnstead of repealing the De
: .n of Independenceâ why not resort
to a plan that gives you plenty of money, !
not only In San Francisco but throughout !
th<- State, not only In California but i
throughout the I'nited States, and have a
Tic and bimetallism instead of a gold I
standard and an empire-? (Cheers.)
Benefit of Bimetallism.
Some one asked a while ago What b^ne
fle bimetallism would have, if the quan
titative theory of money is correctâ if more ;
money moans better timesâ then we reply !
that fold and silver together will give
you more money than gold alone; and !
that when you have gold and .silver to
gether when you have enough money to!
maintain the level of pnetfnâ fhen you will
have a dollar that will be staple in its ;
purchasing power, and the man who pro
duces wealth will not lie compelled to
lo*e, and the man who owns money and
it will not gather from all tho !
houses of the people an unearned Incre
ment in the enhanced value of the. dollar
that he collects where he has loaned
money
Bimetallism restores a foundation I
bnad enough to support the commercial
transactions of the country. You tell me :
thnt one standard gives you a sound |
system. I deny it. When the gold
Standard is carried to its logical conclu
sion. ;hen only gold will be legal tender
for debt.; and with billions of dollars of i
debt, qvery man who owe* will be com- I
pcUed to go into the market and buy i
gold with which to pay his dnht. You
Increase the demand for gold and you
put it in the power of the men who hold
gold to demand an Increased price for
their money. You place all your rom
mercial transactions upon the narrow
basis furnished by goldâ a basis soÂ«nar

row that foreign financiers- can bring a
panic in this country. You tell me that
it is a safe system that places this na
tion at the mercy of foreign financiers,
and 1 tell you that I would blush to call
myself an ' American if I favored a sys
tem that was so narrow that foreign
financiers could hold bankruptcy over
this nation. (Applause.)
In Control of Banks.
But I have talked longer than I Intended
to on this phase of the BUbject, and what
1 have sain has only been introductory to
the question that I want to talk about.
Well, let me extend that introduction for
a moment longer. T want to repeat what
I said, thai on every question the Repub
lican party is putting the dollar above the
man, but "on the money question the Re
publican party is not only putting the
dollar above the man but is putting the
dollar of the foreign financiers above all
the people of this country. (Applause)
Not satisfied with a standard money ana
policy that gives you a small volume of
standard moneyâ so small that it can be
controlled by foreign financiersâ the Re
publican party is planning to retire the
greenbacks and turn over the paper
money of this country to the control of
the nationaJ hanks. A bill reported by
the Republican committee of the lower
House provides that the greenbacks shall
be redeemed in gold and that the nation
shall issue bonds at -'â¢_â¢ per cent, both in
terest and principal in gold, in ordt-r to
secure the gold to redeeem the green
backs.
Banks Eat Cake and Keep It.
Then the bill provides that the banks
may take those bonds and Issue upon them
bank notes up to par"; and the bill pro
vides further for the reduction of tin tax
on national bank circulation from one per
cent to a fraction of' one per cent. What
it mean? It moans the substitution
of bonds for greenbacks ami more tax< s
upon the people to pay the interest on the
bonds; whereas now the greenbacks draw
no interest. It means that the banks that
SCENES ATTENDING THE NEBRASKAN'S ARRIVAL.
now issue up to SO per cent can then have i
an additional privilege and issue up to
100 per cent. it means that the banks now
enjoying special privileges shall have a
reduction made in the taxation upon their
circulation, while the taxes are Increased
upon the rest of the people, why? Be
cause the national banks want it, and the
national banks have more influent yer
the policy of the Republican party than
all the poor Republicans who have voted
the Republican ticket, it takes and de
posits the bonds with the Seen tan of the
Treasury and receives In exchange na
tional bank notes up to urn per cent of the
par value of the bonds. In other words.
by depositing its bonds it receives back
in bank notes what it paid for the bonds,
so it has th>' use or the money and then
it draws Interesi upon the money besides. ;
Mother us. d to Ml me that I could either
eat my oak.- or keep it, but a national
bank "under that law can eat its cake
and keep it, too. (Applause and laughter.)
It is simply another evidence of the pol
icy of tho Republican party in putting the
dollar above tho man.
The Question of Trusts.
But there is another question. Some
people call it a now question, but it is
not it Is an old question. The trust
question Is not new. We had it in i 1896,
and although most of the ROOple did not
know which way to vote, the trusts did,
because they supported the party that Is
now in power, and they have already been
â¢lble to get much more back out of the
neople thnn they contributed to securing
the election of an administration that
would look after the trusts. I ciiarge that
the Republican party cannot destroy the
trusts and why? That party forgets the
commandment: "Remember now thy
( re; n.r in the days of thy youth. Whai
would the Republican party do without
the support of the great corporations of
/this country? And if the President had
intended to extinguish the trusts he
would hardly have gone to New Jersey
to secure an Attorney General to extin
guish them. _
You tell me thnt the Republican party
[a doing what it ought to. I deny it. The
attorney General could enforce the law I
if he wanted to, and if he would not -o ,
it the President would get one who could. |
even if be had to go out of the Republi
can party to find him. If the Attorney
General enforces the law and the Supremo
Court decides that the law is not suffi
cient the (Attorney General canrecommend
a new law that is sufficient. That is in
his power and h^ has not done nis duty
until he does that, for tho present law
la not sufficient Hut you say that may. c
the Supreme Court would hold that no law
could extinguish trusts under our pres- j
ont constitution. Then the Attorney Gen
eral should recommend an amendment to
the constitution that would give to Con
irress the power to exterminate trusts:
but instead of doing his he writes a letter
saying that if there is any relief it must
be found in the States. I deny that the
States are able tn furnish a complete re
lief I believe that the Federal Govern
ment that reaches into every nook and
corner of the land is tho only power suf
ticient to cope with the trusts. I be
lieve it is possible for the Federal Gov
ernment to extinguish the trusts.
License Corporations.
You ask me how it can be done, and I
reply that .very corporation organized in
any State shall be compelled to take out
a license from the Federal Government
before it does business in any other State
excepting the State in which it is organ
ized. (Applause.) When that license is
reoiuired it ran be granted under condi
tions that will squeeze the water out of
a stock and prevent monopoly in any
source of production. It is possible to
extinguish the trusts, and the only ques
tion is: Do we want- to extinguish them?
Why, I read the other day in a Repub
lican paper that there were good trusts
and bad trusts. That will be the argu
ment they will use; now ynu watch for
it. You will find that while Republican
conventions declare against trusts. Re
publican newspapers will explain what a
blessing a good trust really is to the
country. And here is an editorial taken
i from the Times-Herald of Chicago, an
editorial which comments upon an inter-
I View given out by John J. Mitchell, pres
-1 Ident of the Illinois Trust Rnd flavin**
Hank of Chicago. He says: "In the long
run trusts can do no harm. On tiie con- i
trary, I can see good results from well
and practically managed as well as hon
estly formed trusts."
That Is the defense based on the Inter
view of a banker. You toll me to drop the j
money question and light the trusts, and I
tell you that when you get within gunshot |
of the bulwarks of trusts you will find
behind tin- bulwarks every prominent
financier that you found fighting for the
| gold standard in IS%. ("Applause. >
Principle of Monopoly Bad.
The principle of monopoly is bad every
where, and instead of confining our fight
to a soap trust or toothpick trust we in
tend to declare war against all trust?â the '
money trust as well as the industrial !
trust. (Applause.) J believe that the prin
ciple of monopoly in private hand? Is an
Intolerable thing in a republic. AYe think i
! that a landed aristocracy Is bad, and It
would bo dangerous; but a landed aris- !
tocracy would be an innocent thing com- I
pared to an industrial aristocracy that :
has grown up under the trust system. !
When a few men control tho sources of I
production, fixing the prices of all that
pou buy, and the prices of all that you
jell, and the rate of Wfages, it will be diffi
â¢u!t to maintain In this country a gov
rnmeni of th< people, by the people and
or the people (Applause) We appeal to
he Republicans as well as the Democrats
to ask themsi ires whether it is not timo
to destroy the trusts, even if in doing so
hey have to >! sstroy the Republican party

tin- contributions which the trusts pay.
[Applause. 1
Two New Questions.
Hut there are two new questions which
have been thrust upon this country as a
result of tin- war. the question of mili
arism and the question of imperialism.
(Applause.) !iut I want to speak to you
iboui them. I came here to speak to you
because I ha c been told that you are in
favor of an Imperial policy. (Cries of "No,
no, no.") I trust that I have in the audi
eno< to-nj K ht some of those who favor
Imperialism. If it be true that there are
imperialists ir tins State and city, I want
to talk to ih-m. and I want to tell them
thai Imperialism cannot exist without its
twin brother, militarism. I want to tell
them that you cannot have an empire
puch as the nations of Europe have un
less you have a large army to keep your
subjects in constant awe. I want to" tell
you that it will be easier to increase the
â trmy lrom 100,000 to 200,000 than it was to
Increase II from 2"..00n to inn .Mo.
in 1896 25,000 soldiers were enough in tho
regular army, and yet in December 1898
1 Republican President asked for a stand
ing army of II 1.000 men. What is the dif
.erence between a republic and an empire?
1 he difference is that 20.0(hi soldiers are
nough for a republic of seventy millions
tiut it takes 100,000 soldiers for an empire
with ten millions more. (Applause.* Who
cvill pay the expense? It is estimated that
this increase Âf 75,000 soldiers, if they
terve outside of the United States will
Increase the military establishment by
norÂ« than one hundred million dollar's,
i year. Who is to pay it? The Filipinos?
>\ by, if we make them pay it we will
save to :ax them several times as much

rule; and If we did that, how will the Fii
pinos know what a saving it was to have
081 Spain and got us? (Applause and
heera). Hut If we don't make the Fili
pinos pay it, who will pay it? You say
.he Ami-rican people. Yes. the American
people, the taxpayers among the Ameri
â 'â¢'">" 1 pie. You want an English standi
ng army, but you arc not willing to have
in English income tax to pay your stand
ng army. You want an English colonial
aolicy, but you are not willing to have an
English Income tax to support it. You
vyant English ideas and you want an
English financial system. You want
in English army system and an
English colonial system, but you want to
make the poor people of this country pay
tor it. while the syndicates will reap all
Lhe benefits of the expenditures.
Birthright for Pottage.
I don't wnnt to argue this question upon
:he low conception of dollars and cents. I
want to declare as a principle that this
nation cannot afford to sell its birthright
for a mess of pott;ige, no matter' how val
uable the pottage may be. But if there.
Is a mat; in this audience who is fond of
pottage and who does not care anything
about birthrights I want him at least to
inspi c-i the pottage before he makes the
trade. Argue it upon the basis of dollars
and cents. I tell you you cannot defend!
imperialism from a money standpoint. I
have no doubt that we could whip the Fil
ipinos. 1 have never had any doubt of it.
Why? I am just American enough to
think that we can whip any nation in the
world that we ought to whip. I know
that we can whip the Filipinos because
Spain was a much smaller nation than
ours and she had almost finished the job j
and she had only been at it 300 years. And
then she got twenty millions of dollars for
the option on the flght when she went out.
(Prolonged cheering.)
Whip! Why, of course we can whip. We
can't tell how long it will take or how
much it will cost or how often we will
have to repent the whipping, but we can
do it. But shall a great nation act upon
what it can do or upon what it ought to
do? (Cheers.)
I "would not live by a man as a neigh
bor who acted on the principle that he
would do everything that he could do.
and I know of no way of measuring the
responsibility of a nation except by the
rules which we use in measuring the re
sponsibilities of a man. It is the bully
and the braggart, the man who relies on
bruto force, who goes round and tells
what he can do. It is the civilized man.
the Christian, who asks what hÂ» ought
to do, and does it regardless of conse
quences. But if yon are going to argue
it on the basis of dollars and cents, put
down on one side what It will cost to
subdue and hold in subjection 5.000.000 of
people 7000 miles away from our shores,
scattered over 1200 islands, and living in
the jungles of a tropical clime: and then
on the other side put down what we are
going to get out of the job. and then
when you have done that, find out who
is going to pay what we spend and
who is going to get what we get.
(Cheers.) I hear some people say
that if we hold the Philippine Islands
they will furnish homes for our surplus
population. Sixty people to the square
mile in the Philippine Islands and twenty
to the square mile in the United States.
Why, when we unite the Philippine Is
lands with th" United States the move
ment will be from the Philippine Islands '
t<-> the T'nited Statesâ not from the L nited
States to the Philippine Islands. If every
Filipino were to die to-morrow and leave
the islands without a hostile man. we
could not force a thousand people to Â£<<
from the United States to live and work
In the islands over there. (Cheers.) The
white race will not work In the tropics,
and if our people went there to live and
to work they would be different people
in three generations from those whom
they left at home.
No Homes There.
I repeat that that country will never
furnish homes to our people. If you want
to furnish homes to your people spread
out over ten years the money spent on
the army In one year in the Philippine Is
lands; spread that money out fur ten
years in reclaiming the arid lands of the
mountain States and you will furnish
homes for more people than will pro to the
Philippine Islands in a thousand years
(Cheers). You tell me that San Francisco
and California will profit by the policy.
Spend upon a canal across the Isthmus
the money you will spend in nne year on
the war in the. Philippines and you will
have a canal that will carry your products
by water from San Francisico. If you
want to spend money for the American
geople you can spend it in the United
ta.tes. Tell me that we have to have the
Philippine Islands to furnish an invest
ment for American capital? Why? I re
mind you that was only three years ago
when we had to have a financial system
patterned after England in order to in
vite English capital over to the United
States for investment. Three years ago
we had to adopt an English financial sys
tem to get capital in the country and now
we have to adopt an English colonial sys
tem to get our capital out of the coun
try. Every dollar that goes from the
United States to the Philippine Islands is
taken out of the United States for in
vestment. Tell me. that it will bring
money? Why? I remember that (or
twenty years the people of California were
pleading with the people of the rest of
the Union to rise up and help them close
the doors of this country aga.nst Oriental
immigration, and now you want to force
eight millions of Malays into the United
States. (Loud cheers).
History of Colonization.
But, my friends, if you think that our
people will go to the Philippine Islands
read tho history of other colonization
schemes. The Netherlands have had pos
session of Java for three hundred yean
and yet there are less than sixty "thou
sand people of European birth out of
twenty-iive millions of people in Java,
you think that our people will 50 and
settle in the Pbllipine Islands? Read the
history of English rule in India. England
has dominated India for lr>o years and
yet there are only 100,000 people of British
birth in all India out of Â»Â». 00*1 ,000 of peo
ple. England, over-crowded England,
has only been able to force a handful of
ti< r surplus population into Tndia with
its 300,000,000 souls. Do you believe that
these people in India enjoy having the
English there? If you do. I want to tell
you that it takes 70,000 British soldiers
to make life bearable for 100.000 British
citizens in India; and it takes a native
army of 140,000 to help a British army of
70.M0 to keep 100,000 people of British
birth in the saddle while they ride 300, Â»
000,000 of people in India. That is the his
tory of English rule there; and do you
think England does it for the purpose of
educating them? I want to tell youâ l
want to tell the -women that after 150
years of English rule in India less than
1 per rent of the women of India can
read and write, and less than 5 per cent
of the total population. Do you tell me
that England is doing it for the spread
of religion? I tell you that after 150 years
of English rule in India less than 1 per
cent of the people have embraced the
Christian religion. And why should they?
"Why should any man accept the Chris
tian religion at the hands of any man
man who preaches that you shall love
your neighbor as yourself and then
reaches his hand into his neighbors
pocket. (Loud cheers.)
But I am not going to discuss this ques
tion from the financial standpoint. I am
going to discuss it from other stand
points.
Gold Loving Christianity.
What other argument is made in behalf
of an imperial policy? Why, we are told
that we have to go over there and con
quer and hold in subjection the r'ilipinos
in order to extend the limits of the Chris- \
tian religion. My friends, I once thought J
that the dollar argument was the lowest
argument ever made in behalf of im
perlalisin, but I believe that the argu
ment based upon Christian hypocrisy is
a meaner argument than the dollar argu- j
ment. Go over there for the love of God!
(Laughter and cheers.) No, my friends!
There is one more Utter In the word: It
Is love of goldâ not love of God. I de
nounce forcible Christianity. When you
Bhoot the gospel out of a Gatling gun the
man who is shot does not need the
gospel any more and the man who
is missed is too busy burying the
dead to listen to your teachings. Our \
gOÃpel appeals to the hearts of the hu- !
mnn race. You can't administer it to the
body by hypodermic injections.
If you want to know what the Bible
says upon the subject of forcible Chris
tianity turn to that passage where Christ
visited the village of Samaria and where
they refused to receive him, and one of
the disciples asked if they should call
down fire from heaven to consume the
people as a punishment, and Christ re
buked them and said: "Ye know not what
manner of spirit ye are of. The Son of
man is not come to destroy men's lives
but to, same them." That is the gospel
that we have learned to love.
I wish that every citizen in the United
States, at least every Christian, could
read a sermon delivered by Rev. W. T.
Brown at Rochester. N. V.. not many
weeks ago. lie took for his text that i
verse which describes the scene before !
Pilate, -where Pilate said to Christ:
"Knowest thou not that I have power to
release thee or to put thee to death?"
and with that v> rse as his text the min
ister proceeded to contrast the doctrine
of force with the gospel of love. There
was Pilate, the representative of Caesar,
and behind Caesar the Roman Govern
ment and behind the Roman Government
the Roman legions, and before Pilate
was Christ, defenseless, preaching the
gospel of love. And the minister pointed
out how, from that day, the power of
Caesar had waned and the power of
Christ had increased. He pointed out
how the Roman Government and Its Hu
man legions had vanished away, and the
earth knew them no more, while year by
year the people in increasing numbi r'^
took upon their lips' the name of the me< k
and lowly Nazarene who stood defense- !
less in the presence of power. And then j
the minister pointed out that in this i
nation force and love stand face to face.
The United . States is Pilate's council I
chamber, and on the one side is brute
force and on the other side is love. What
shall be the verdict of this nation? Shall
we go forth with a sword in hand to
slay, to murder and to plundi r, or shall
we go forth preaching the gospel of 1 ive
and hold up the image of a republic and
invite all men to rise and demand self
government? (Ix)ud cheering.)
A Sermon in Verse.
How can a Christian, how can a min
ister, see in a war of conquest waged by
a republic against a people who want a
republicâ how can a Christian or a min
ister see in such a war the hand of God
directing and pointing out a destiny to
people? If you belleVe that this nation,
great as it is, is great enough to do wrong '
I want you to listen to a few verses writ
ten by an unknown poetâ a poet whose
name perhaps you have never heard, who ;
lived a few years ago in Lincoln. He now
lives In Denver, and I ran across his j
verses, that contain more of truth and j
more of Gospel and more of Christ's r< -
It Li i< â¢ n than you will find in any sermon
I ever delivered in defense of an imperial
policy. Let me read the wurds:
We are mad, xrown mad, in thÂ° race for gold;
We are drunk uith the wine of gain.
The truths our fathers proclaimed of old
We spurn with a high disdain.
But while the cnnquerer's race we run.
Our rulers should not forgpt
That the God who reigned uver Babylon
Is the God who is reigning yet.
"Would we tread in the paths of tyranny,
Nor reckon the tyrants cost?
Who taketli another 1 ? liberty,
His freedom is also lost.
Would we win as a ptrong man ever won,
Make ready to pay the debt.
Fur the (.;,_.,] who reigned over Babylon
Is the God who is reigning yet.
The ruins of dynasties passed away
In eloquent silence lie.
And the despots fate is the s>ame to-day
That it was in the days gone Uy.
Against all wrong and injustice done
A rigid account Is set.
For the God who reigned over Babylon
Is the God who is reigning yet.
The laws of life are eternal laws,
Thf> judgments of truth are true;
My great blind masters, I bid you pause
And lock on the work you do.
y "ii bind with shackles your fellow man,
Your hands with his blood are wetâ
And the <;<"! who reigned over Babylon
Is the God who i 9 reigning yet.
No man ever lived who was great
enough to trespass upon the right of an
other, and no man will ever live that will |
be great enough to do wrong with im
punity.
What Ought the Nation Do?
My friends, the question is not what
tills nation can do; the question is what
this nation ought to do. And if you be
lieve that we are following the principles
of Christian religion in the warfare that I
we are making to throw the net of this
Government over an unwilling- people and :
doing it as missionaries and for the love
of God, I warn you that you cannot fit
ford to plant upon the Philippine soil the
doctrine of forcible Christianity. If you
want to convert your brother go forth
: with your arguments and appeal to him. |
I If he wants to convert you let him appeal
i to you; but if you plant upon the PnrTlp
] pine islands this doctrine of forceâ if you
! attempt to .shoot your gospel into ihe
people of another raceâ l warn you that :
1 the time is not far distant when that
principle will be planted on American soil,
and we will he shooting our particular
brands of Christianity into each oftler !
! and doing it for the love of God (Cheers.) ;
War Not Made by Speeches.
But they Bay we must not make any
speeches In this country against forcible
annexation while the war lasts. My
friends, it is not the speeches made in this â 
country thai are Inciting the Filipinos to
; armed resistance. If their resistance is j
: due to speeches made in this country j
I their resistance is due to speeches made I
by the generations that are past, and if
' you want to find speeches and declara
! iions that inspire nations of this world to
resist foreign domination go back tv the !
days of Patrick Henry, when he gave to I
the world that impasssioned plea, "Give j
me liberty or give me death." He ut
tered a sentence that ran round the world
and its echo will last forever. (Cheering.)
Go hack to the days- of Washington, for
when he drew his sword against taxation
without representation he set an example
known and loved of all men. Go back to
the days of Thomas Jefferson, fur when â 
he wrote that all men are created equal, 1
that they are endowed with inalienable
rights, that Governments are instituted
to preserve these rights, and that Gov- â 
ernments derive their just powers from 1
the consent of the governedâ when Thorn- I
as Jefferson set forth those principles he :
incited the people' of all races and all 1
climes to protest against government
without the consent \of the governed.
(Cheers.) \
But if you -haven't tlrfie to go back to
the early days you can certainly go back 1
as far as the days <>f Abraham Lincoln,
for when Abraham Lincoln upon the bat
tlefield of Gettysburg defended a govern
ment of the people by the people and for
the people he did more to make people
dissatisfied with foreign domination than
any man who has spoken since the war.
Love of Liberty Our Safety.
My friends, if you want to find words
and speeches and sentiments that stir up
I pie to fi^ht for liberty, you can find
t l lf . speeches and the sentiment? among
the records of the past. But you don't
have to go to a written speech. You
don't have to go t.> a word spoken or writ
ten by any man. because the love of lib
erty was placed in the human heart by
the Almighty and no matter what a man's
color is. no matter where he lives, that
spirit exist? and we dare not quencn that
spirit, no matter where we find it. f^r
it is 'he safety of our own liberty. (Cheer
ing).
Let me read you what Abraham Lincoln
said about the spirit of Independence and
of liberty. In a speech made in IHSK lie used
these words: "What constitutes the bul
wark of our own liberty and independ
ence? It is not our frowning battlements,
(.in bristling sea-coasts, or our army and
our navy. These are not our reliance
against " tyranny. All of these may be
turned against us without making us
weaker for the struggle. Our reliance is
in the love of liberty which God has plant
ed in us. Our safety Is In the spirit which
prizes liberty as the heritage of all men,
in all lands, everywhere." Now, mark
these words: "Destroy this spint and you
have planted the seeds of despotism at
your own doors. Familiarize yourselves
with the chains of bondage and you pre
pare your limbs to wear them. Ac
customed to trample on the rights of
others you have lost the genous of your
own Independence and become the fit sub
jects of the first cunning tyrant who
rises among you."
Those are the words of Abraham Lin
coln. Destroy the spirit that prizes lib
erty as the heritage of all men. In all
lands, everywhere, Lincoln says, destroy
this spirit, and you have planted the
s"rds of despotism at your own doors.
You ask me why I protest against forci
ble annexation? You ask m<; why I pro
test against a war of conquest waged by
a republic? 1 tell you 1 do not want to
plant the seeds of despotism at our own
doors. I hate despotism and I love the
Declaration of Independence. And it is
because I hate the one and love the other
that I declare to you that this nation
cannot afford to surrender its principles
in order to enter upon a war of conquest,
no matter how profitable It may bt>. And
I ask you this question: What shall it
profit a nation if it gain the whole world
and lose the spirit of its own inde
pendence and its own liberty? "Cheers.)
Two Sources of Government.
But you ask me what can be done.
Strange question for a person to ask in a
republic. There are but two sources of gov
ernmentâforce and consent. Monarchies
n si upon force, republics upon consent.
The Declaration of Independence says that
governments derhe their just powers fr.'m
the consent of the governed, is it true or
is it false? If that doctrine is true, then
this nation cannot acquire title to people
by conquest. If that doctrine is true, then
this nation cannot acquire title by pur
chasing domination from an alien mon
arch whose rebellious subjects we our
selves armed to light against that mon
arch. CCheers.)
You ask me what we could do. I say
that the treaty that recognized the inde
pendence of Cuba should have recognized
the Independence of the Philippine Islands
at the Fame time. (Cheering.) And lr
that treaty had recognized the independ
ence of the Philippine Islands not a drop
of blood would have been shed at Manila.
But you ask me what could be done after
the treaty was made. I say that the ad
ministration could have given to the.Fili
pinos the same assurance of ultimate in
dependence that the administration gave
to the people of Cuba, and if the adminis
tration had given that assurance not a
drop of blood would have been shed at
Manila.
Well, you tell me that it would have
been too much for the President to as
sumeâtoo much responsibility. 1 tell you
that Congress was in session for nearly
three months after the treaty was signed,
and he could have laid the matter before
Congress and asked of Congress authority
to make this promise to the Fillpnios.
Even in spite of his inaction a resolution
promising independence was introduced in
the Senate â the Bacon resolutionâ and
upon final vote it stood a tie, and the vote
of the Vice President was necessary to
prevent the Filipinos from receiving the
same assurance that the people of Cuba
received of ultimate independence.
(Cheering.)
What Can Be Done Now.
You ask me what can be done now. I
say thru the President could now give
the assurance that could have been given
in the beginning. But you tell me
that it is too late â that Congress
has adjourned. I reply thai the Presi
dent ran call Congress together and ask
of Congress authority to promise inde
pendence to the Filipinos upon the same
terms granted to the Cubans.
. But you tell me it will cost money. I
tell you it won't cost as much as a war.
and anyhow, haven't we spent money
on special sessions before. Didn't one
President call Congress together to re
peal the Sherman act because the
bankers asked it? And didn't an
other President call Congress together
to raise the tariff because the manufact
urers asked it? And couldn't a President
now call Congress together to declare to
the world that the Declaration of Inde
pendence is still law in the United
States? (Cheers.)
You asked me if the army must be
withdrawn before government is estab
lished. 1 reply to you that if we will
tell the Filipinos that the gov
ernment when established shall be their
government and not ours it will not re
quire any army to restore order In the
Philippine Islands. (Cheers.) What
shall we do? If I find a pocketbook In
the road and on that pocketbook reads
the name of the owner, how long does it

How can you draw a line between the
Cubans and the Filipinos, and say that
the Cubans ought to be- free but that the
Filipinos ought to be subjects?
I say that if the declaration ls true, if
governments come up from the people,
then we ought to assure the Filipinos
Of our intention to give them their own
government; and I will go further than
thai. When people fall into the hands
of this nation this nation must deal with
those people according to American Ideas
not according to European ideas.
and when thÂ© republics of Sou:.; America
sprang into existence we announced to
the old world - . republic was
planted upon American soil the ground
upon which It loly ground and
that no king could ever set his foot upon
that soil again. And so 1 say let us ex
tend to the Philippine Islands the doctrine
that we have â¢ â - ruled to Central and
South An. Ing helped them
to achieve their Independence let us say
to th â  9 d up. be free," and to all
the world saj : "Hands off. and let that
republic live and w^rk out its destiny."
<Loud an fed cheering.)
The Doctrine of Our Fathers.
You tell me that it would be humiliating
for us to surrender the title to these isl
ands. I tell you that when our fore
fathers were only three millions In number
we were willing to declare to the
â¢world that the people were the only source
â¢of power; and shall we seventy "millions
be asham^i to admit that we believe in
the doctrine for which our fathers fought
and bled and died? Tell me that the na
tions of Europe will laugh at us. I say
let 'them laugh. Let them laugh. But
when this nation, a republic, says to the
world, "We take up arms to extend the
area of self-government, to enable the
crushed to realize their aspirations for
liberty," we'll shake every crown In
Europe. .(Prolonged cheers.)
America a World Power.
I hear them say that we must be a
â world power, and they call us diminutive
.Americans because we do not accept their
idea of a world power. Wiiy, if they only
knew it, this nation has been a world
power for a hundred years. For more than
ten decades this nation has exerted an
influence upon the politics of the human
race equal to that of ail the nations ot
the world combined; and we have exerted i
that influence without swords or Gatling
guns. For a hundred years we have
traveled that pathway that lead? from the
low domain of might to the high domain
of right, and what a glorious history we
have made! I would not trade that his
tory, that history of republic tor a
hundred years, for all the history of all
thÂ»Â» monarchies that have risen and fallen
since time fan. (Cheers.)
You tell me that we must go forward.
I teil you that imperialism takes us back
ward." It is not going upward and on
ward, it is going back to the narrow
views of kings and emperors.
Have you heard or read that poem
written by Dr. Taylor, entitled "The
Creed and the- Flap"? There is one verse
that contains so much of truth that I
shall repeat It to you even at the risk of
tiuoting something that you have already
heard.
Did our liberty bell ring In vain?
Was the Declaration a lie?
Must we turn to the Old World again
With a peaitent .-.Â«-. - cry?
Must we arm us and march in the ran
Of Europe's barbaric para
Not a Prodigal Nation.
It is all true, my friends, and I ask the
question of you: Did our liberty bell
ring in vain? History tells us that when
the Declaration was about to be signed
the people gathered in the streets and
waited for the signal, and finally when
those immortal names were affixed to the
immortal document, the old liberty bell
rang out and the people* caught up the
Kuiiad and cheered and cheered again.
And from that day to this that liberty
bell has been carried from State to State
and from city to city, and eyes have tilled
with tears as they gazed upon that sa
cred relic of Revolutionary days.
Did that liberty bt-11 ring in vain? Must
Us tones no more be heard? Was the
"Declaration a lie? Have we been false for
a hundred years in declaring that govern
ments come up from the people? Must we
go hack to European ideas and say that i
a government, instead of being mad by j
the p*"ople and fnr the people, is a thing
about thirteen inches in diameter, round
in shape and fired out of a cannon? Must
we turn to the Old "World again with a
penitent prodigal's cry? This nation is
not a prodigal son. This nation has not
wasted its substance in riotous living. |
This nation Is not ready to go back and ]
with trembling voice, ask permission to be j
2r.clu.ded among 1 - hired servants of royalty. |
This nation has not sinned against heaven
nor in the sight of man. and God grant
that the crowm-d heads of the Old world |
may never have occasion to kill the fatted |
calf to celebrate the return of this repub
lic from independence back to the creed of
King? and to the gospel of force, j
(Cheers.)
What shall we do Stand true to the !
faith of the fathers and to the principles
of their government. Because tine people
of France were friendly to us during the
devolution the people of France joined
with the United States and placed In New
York harbor a heroic statue representing
Liberty enlightening the world. What a
glorious conception of our nation - mis
s'on among the nations of the earth!
What shall we do?
Take the statue down and send It back
to France, and tell them that we;. â¢ not -
in the liberty business any more? laugh
ter > Sha'l we send over to England and
borrow a second-hand statue of William
the Conqueror and place it in New York
harbor to indicate the change that has
taken plac 3 ? We can if we will, but we
n'+^d not unless we desire to. I propose
an American plan, and that la that we
rive the Filipinos the same assurance of
independence and protection that we have
given to the Cubans, and then the chil
dren of the Filipinos will join with our
children and place â¢, Manila Bay a new
statute of liberty enlightening the Orient,
and that is an American policy. (Loud
cheering.)

Meeting of Continental League.
Continental League held its regular
monthly meeting last night at Saratoga
Hall on Geary- street. The attendance
was good. There were seven new mem
bers admitted, which brings the roll up
to 18W since the start of the league, four
years ago.
An invitation from Garfleld league to
participate in memorial service in Golden
Gate Park on the 17th met with a cold
reception. The cause of this was not be
â  â¢:, ise of any disrespect to Garileld or the
memorial service, but rather on account
of an objection to the parties whose
names are at the head of the movement.
Consequently the league declined to par
ticipate as a body at the monument in
the park.
Frank D. Worth mentioned that the
league should take some action regard
ing the registration of voters, stating
that registration will close in the City
Hall on the 21st of October, and as there
will be no precinct registration it will be
necessary for those who did not vote at
the last election or at the late primary, or
who have moved since, to get registered
now.
It was stated incidentally that the Re
publican party would not make its nom
inations for municipal officers until the
end of the month, or such time as the â 
Supreme Court decides the issue now j
before it regarding the validity of the !
new charter.

JURY FAILS TO AGREE.
Case Against Evelyn Holt Finally
Dismissed by Judge Lawler.
Evelyn Holt was placed on trial be
fore Judge Lawlor and a jury yester
day for an assault with a deadly
weapon on Carl Fecker on September 5
last. Holt has been absent from the city
for some time ar.d all efforts to locate
him have been wKhout result. FeÂ«ker
came into prominence by marrying
"Jennk- Webber," the nemesis of Col
onel William J. Sutherland. It was
this marriage that caused the alleged
attempt on Fecker's life by Miss Holt.
Several witnesses pave testimony as
to the Immediate facts surrounding the
shooting. The case oi the people rested.
Miss Holt then took the stand and told
the story of her betrayal and her futile
attempt on her betrayer's life.
Miss Holt told her story without the
least manifestation of emotion, while
even the jurors, when sho- reached por
tions of her story relating to the revolt
ing cruelties of her 1 etrayer. became
plainly uneasy. When the defendant
left the Ptami District .Attorney Mur
phy made his argument. Attorney
Terry waived his ri^ht to arcu.- the
case "on behalf p* his client. Judge Law -
lor instructed the jury and it retired to
deliberate on a verdict.
The jury was out i:ntll nearly mid
night and then the foreman announced
that they were unable to agree on a
verdict. Judge Lawlor accepted the
situation and discharged the jury, and
realizing the improbability of securing
a conviction of the prisoner ordered the
case against her dismissed.

THE ALCAZAR
DROPS EASILY
INTO COMEDY
CHRISTOPHER JR., though not a re
markable play, is a very Interesting
one, for the buoyancy and exuber
ance of that youthful scapegrace,
Christopher, flood the action with a
brightness little inferior to noonday.
One is kept busy chasing his intentions
and he always does the. unexpected. A
I wholesome neglect of thinking is his
J chief characteristic. Mr. Ormonde, the
leading man, is a grateful new element
in the Alcazar. He is the proverbial
"little leaven." He seems a quiet ap
peal for freshness, for ne^y methods, and
or.c abides hopefully the issue of this ap
peal. He has a well-modulated voice, a
good stage presence, considerable intelli
gence, much dramatic enthusiasm and
such beautiful teeth! Since the time when
a mere boy he ran away from home to
I join a "fly-by-nlght" company playing
| lurid melodrama (and was glad enough
i to be caught and curried home), he has
' kept his eye steadily fixed upon his one
ambition, and his experience covers a
period of seventeen years. Little Helen
Henry, the new ingenue, is very pretty,
very satisfactory, and, I am told, very
witty. She seems endowed with that
dram of wisdom that teaches one to avoid
the ornamental business and the greater
vice of playing to the audience. A friend
vouches for this bit of youthful repartee:
When Helen was but 6 they were one day
laboring up one of San Francisco's steep
est. "This is Russian Hill, is it not?"
said the friend. "Not going up," groaned
Helen, "but it certainly is coming down."
Miss Foster has improved with experi
ence â she is more natural and has lost
some of that staccato touch she invari
ably gave her lines. She lacks magnet
ism, but she is responsible and always
sure of her lines. 1 should place Mon
taine second in Inti rest to Mr. Ormonde
this week. He makes such a delightfully
wooden Mr. Glibb. Applause is frequent
throughout the play, but some of the best
lines fall dead. I wonder why. Of course
j there is a joy in silence, but not to the
j actor. After* a brief summer of the le-
g itimate and romantic with Mr. M" r rison
! and Miss Roberts, the I a~t stems to drop
back easily into the needs of the society
play. Not even a suggestion of small
clothes was apparent in their elocution,
and not a stride. Next week "The Wages
of Sin" will be played.

A Squeamish Proofreader.
Perhaps I may be pardoned .for a
brief reference to an odd complication
that arose while "The Luck of Roaring
Camp" was being put into type in the
printing office where The Overland
Monthly was prepared for publication.
A young lady who served as proofread
er in the establishment had been some
what shocked by the scant morals of
the mother of Luck, and when she
came to the scene where Kentuck, aft
er reverently fondling the infant, said,
"He wrastled with my finger, the dâ d
little cusp," the indignant proofreader
was ready to throw up her engagement
rather than go any further with a story
so wicked immoral. There was
consternation throughout the establish
ment, and the head of the concern went
to the office of the publisher with the
virginal proofreader's protest. Unluck
ily, Mr. Roman was absent from the,
city. Harte, when notified of the ob
stacle raised in the way of "The Luck
of Roaring Camp," manfully insisted
that the story must be printed as he
wrote it or not at all. Mr. Roman's lo
cum-tenens, in despair, brought the ob
jectionable manuscript around to my
office and asked my advice.
When I had read the sentence that
had caused all this turmoil, having first
listened to the tale of the much-both
ered temporary publishers, I surprised
him by a burst of laughter. It seemed
to me incredible that such a tempest
in a teacup could have been raised by
Harte's bit of character sketching.
But, recovering my gravity, I advised
that the whole question should be left
until Mr. Roman's return. I was sure
that he would never consent to any
"editing" of Harte's story. This was
agreed to, and when the publisher
came back a few days later the em
bargo was removed. â The Luck of
Roaring Camp" was printed as it was
written, and printing office and vestal
proofreader survived the shock. â Noah

GERMANY ATTEMPTS
TO SEIZE GEN SAN
Koreans With Russiar>s at Their
Elbow Warn Prince H^ nr y
to Y^eep Off.
!S VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 6.â Malcolm Fenwiok, a Canadian mission
ed ary. who arrived by the Glenogle from Gen San, Korea, tells a story of
>5 how Germany prepared to seize another Kiaoohau. in Korea. He says
5 Prince Henry attempted to attach Gen San for the Kaiser, but the Ko
!? reans, with the Russians at their elbow, frustrated the attempt.
â¢ Shortly before Mr. Fenwick left Gen San the German gunboat Irene
i> swung into port. The residents of Gen San were greatly excited when
5 she arrived, for in the past ten years no German ship has been seen
jj there. When the commander of the Irene went ashore he gave notice
> that the warship Peutschland, with Prince Henry of Germany on board,
would arrive in a few days, and before two days had elapsed^in came the
S big warship with the Prince. The port of Gen San is the outlet for
5 Port T.azareff, to which the Russians have set claim, and the visit of
y the throe warshipsâ for a third German cruiser arrived soon after the
3 Deutschlandâ was, Mr. Fenwick said, the first step toward the acqulsi
Â£ tion of the port by Germany, who is known to have long been looking at
y it with longing eyes. The Germans were doubtless goaded into activity
$ by the manner in which Russia Is usurping Port Lazareff. The harbor
> on which both ports stand is in the- form of a figure 8, and Gen San,
i situated at the junction of the figure, commands the entrance. Prince
> Henry remained at Gen San three weeks and entertained lavishly.
5 Sinister stories were being told by the foreign element during his
1 visit of the leasing of the port, which, as well as being of strategic ad
-2 vantage, is the outlet to the west from the German concession, some
â¢ fifty miles away. While his ships were at Gen San Prince Henry went
> to Fusan to apply for a concession to build a railway from Seoul to Gen
? San. The application was politely refused, the German Prince being
5 told that a Korean company had already been granted such a conces
> sion.
LONG REST FOR
ADMIRAL DEWEY
Will Be Given Indefinite
Leave.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CAM. HEAPQIWRTEKP. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Sept. 6.-
When Admiral Dewey is formally de
tached from sea duty immediately after
the return of the cruiser Olympia next
month he will be granted an indefinite
leave of absence and given duty again
only upon his own application.
Considerable interest was manifiested in
naval circles today by a report from
Gibraltar this morning that the Admiral
had stated that he probably would retire
under the regulations. If the Admiral
holds to this derision he will be placed on
the retired list on December 2'"> next, when
he will have reached the age of 62 years.
Under the law all naval officers, unless
[ally exempted by act of Congress, are
relegated to retirement upon reaching the
age of 62. The act reviving the grade of
Admiral for Admiral Dewey contained a
provision that he should not be retired >x
cept upon his own application. There will
be no change in the Admiral's pay upon
his retirement.
Th-re has been considerable talk In
naval circles regarding the formation of a
board to control important naval matters
and it has been reported that either Ad
mirul Dewey or Admiral Sampson should
be its chairman. Jt is true that a sug
gestion of this kind has been present^
to the department, but there is no likeli
hood that it will be adopted.
At any event an Admiral will not be the
head ot such board. It is possible that
Admiral Sampson will have- duty of an
advisory character, but he will not be as
i to command th< New Fork or any
other navy yard, so far as officials here
are aware of Secretary Long's intention.
I understand Rear Admiral Hichborn,
Chief Constructor, is preparing his views
on the Secretary'" proposition to consoli
date the bureaus of Equipment, Steam
Engineering and Construction and Re
pair, and it will be submitted immediately
upon the Secretary"s return.
Although there is a probability the
rruisor Chicago will return to New York
In time to take part in the recr-ption to
Admiral Dewey, it may be stated posi
tively that there is no Idea at the Depart
ment of permitting Rear Admiral Howi
?on to supersede Rear Admiral Sampson
In charge of the naval ceremonies. Rear
Admiral Howison if senor to Admiral
Sampson and the latter would naturally
be under his command if he were to re
main on the Chicago and take part in the
celebration. The Chicago left Rio de Ja
neiro this morning for Barbadoes, en
route to New York, and is four days
ahead of her Itinerary, which fixed Oc
tober 5 as the date of her arrival. I'nless
Admiral Howison rushes the Chicago
along, therefore, it is hardly likely that he
will arrive at New York until after the
celebration has occurred. In any event
it Is understood he will not be in command
during the reception to Admiral Dewey,
even should it be necessary for the De
partment to issue orders directing his im
mediate detachment.
WILL START A DAILY
PAPER IN SAN RAFAEL
Joseph Fauntleroy, Formerly of the
Journal, Makes the Ex
periment.
SAX RAFAEL, Sept. Joseph Faunt
leroy, a former employe of the Marln
Journal, will start a daily evening news
paper in this city, the first copy to be
issued next week. The last dally paper
published here was issued every morning
by the notorious T. H. Rush and was
named the Sun. The Sun would better
have been published in the Arctic regions,
local newspaper men assert, for it set in
six months.
A similar fate is prophesied for the
journalistic venture of Mr. Fauntleroy, as
the lesson taught by a sad experience is
that San Rafael forms too limited a field
for a daily.

PENDLETON'S DEED
PREMEDITATED
Important Evidence of
Joseph Flynn.
Special Pisratch to The Call.
KESWICK, Sept. 6.â At the Coroner's
inquest held to-day to investigate yester
day morning's tragedy in which John
Pendleton killed Jake Randall but a few
witnesses were called. The most import
ant evidence was that of Joseph Flynn,
a wood-passer who was returning home
from his work an hour before the shoot
ing. He overtook Pendleton on the road
carrying a riflo on his shoulder. He asked
Pendleton why he was carrying a gun
and Per,dleton said: "Jake Randall has
threatened to kill me and I am going to
give him a chance this morning."
No one has been found who can testify
that Randall ever made any threats of
that kind. Mrs. Ends, who is conk at the
bottling works forty yards distant from
the scene of the shooting, says she saw
the whole affair. Randall came down the
hill toward the cabin where Pendleton
stopped. She saw him hold up both hands
as if asking for mercy. Pendleton fired
and Randall fell dead in his tracks. She
was not summoned before the Coroner's
jury. The jury rendered a verdict {hiding
that Randall came to his death by a gun
shot wound Inflicted by John Pendleton
and that it was a case of unjustifiable
homicide.
Eleven of the twelve signed the verdict,
only one refusing to sign with the word
"unjustifiable" retained.

VAQUERO AND INDIAN
FIGHT ON THEIR PONIES
Novel Pugilistic Encounter in Which
the Son of the Forest Is
Worsted.
COVELO, Sept. 6. â A novel pugilistic
engagement took place here to-day. Will
lam Russell, a mountaineer and vaquero,
was "outriding" for a friend who was
breaking a bronco. The bronco got
mixed up with a lot of horses tied to a
horse rack. An Indian, somewhat Intoxi
cated, rode his horse squarely in front of
the bronco and refuspd to move out of
the way. Russell became angry and
threatened the Indian, who took up the
challenge, and the fight was on. The
horses were soon as Furious as the men
and were cavorting and plunging madly,
while the fighter .: were striking and par
rying-. The melee was finally settled
when Russell landed a powerful right
hander on the forehead of the Indian,
who caught himself on the pommel of his
saddle and saved himself from falling.
Blood gushed from his nose and mouth.
Recovering quickly, however, he turned
his horse and galloped toward the reser
vation.
â Warrants were sworn out for both
combatants to appear to-morrow morn
iiiK lÂ»-fore the Justice. The physician at
the reservation thinks the Indian too
badly used up to appear and entertains
grave fears that the encounter may cost
him his life.

Captain Elliott Brings News of a
Number of Drownings on the
Shores of Cook Inlet.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. Sept. 9.â Otto Thews of
Primrose, lowa., who has arrived here \
from Copper River, Alaska, brings news !
confirming the reported deaths of seven
members of the scientific prospecting
company of New York.
The dead are: Earhart, Miller, Aller
man, Schultz, Peter Siegel, Buttner and
Baumgartner.
George Hooker, another member of the
party, got out alive, but is badly crippled
With Bcurvy, which carried away the ma
jority of his companions. Baumgartner
went out hum ing one day and was never
scon again. The most affecting case was
that ot Buttner, who was driven insane
by his sulTeringri. His weak companions
had to strap him down, but even then
they could not restrain him. One morn
ing Thews, whose camp was near, found
Buttner sitting out in the snow with his
clothes and hat off. The thermometer was
45 degrei s below zero. JJuttner was taken
inside, but he died In a few hours. The
party was camped at Twelve Mile camp,
: just beyond Valdes glacier.
Thews also brings a grewsome story in
connection with the rinding of the re
mains of a jeweler named Smith of New (
York, who perished last winter on Valdes .
glacier. Every exposed portion of the :
body had been eaten away by ravens. The I
remains were identified as those of Smith :
by the clothing and effects found with
them. A purse containing %'lbO was among ;
the effects.
A prospector named Austed, a partner <
of Smith, said a money belt which con
tained a considerable sum of money was !
missing. Thews says he had a close call i
crossing the glacier. He fell Into a
crevasse I'M) feet deep, but the pack on
his back caught him and held him until
his companions came to his rescue.
Captain Charles P. Elliott, U. S. A., a
member of the Government exploring
party under Captain Glenn of the Twen
ty-fifth Infantry, which has been gath
ering data at Cook Ir.let, Alaska, has re

meeting a greal many prospectors, nearly
cvi ry one of whom was broke, while
many were sick with scurvy and other
disi uses. The expedition rendered these
unfortunates all tne aid possible.
â¢Cook Inlet," said the captain, "is i

SPONGLE'S CASE
IN THE COURTS
Arguments Begun atSan
Jose.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Sept. 6.â The matter of the
legality of the action of the Governor and
the board of managers of the Agnews
State Hospital for the Insane In removing
Dr. Sponogle from the superintendency of
that institution came up before Judge Hy
land to-day under the writ of review sued
out by H. V. Morehouse, the doctor's at
torney.
In opening the proceedings Attorney
General Ford read an extensive typewrit
ten answer to the petition, in which it was
denied that the meeting of expulsion at
the Palace Hotel was a special meeting,
but was an adjourned session of a regular
meeting. Other material allegations were
denied and the averments made that Dr.
Sponogle was removed In accordance with
the law for the best interests of the hos
pital.
The opening argument was made by At
torney General Ford. He hold that it
was not necessary to prefer charges and
that the board of managers had the right
to remove the superintendent summarily
at any time. It was also contended that
the court had no jurisdiction in that mat
ter and that Dr. Sponogle's remedy was in
a mandamus suit to prevent his removal
from office.
Attorney Morehouso then began his ar
gument in behalf of Dr. Sponogle. It was
directed principally to the point as to
whether the medical superintendent was
elected for a prescribed term of four
years. The law bearing upon this point
was quoted at length.
It was held that the act of the Legis
lature in forming the Lunacy Commission
did not repeal the statutes which provide
for the tenure of office of the medical su
perintendent. It was attempted to be
shown by the speaker that the former
statute, in making the term of four yean
for the officer In question, provided that
he should not be removed without written
charges being made, and had not bevn re
pealed. The matter was then submitted
for decision.

RENNES, Sept. 6.â It has been ru-
mored that as a result of this
morning's scene between Colonel
Jouast, president of the Drey-
fus court-martial, and M. La-
borl, leading counsel for the defense,
the latter wishes to retire from the
case. He is convinced that the judges
are utterly hostile to him, and it was
said he had conceived the idea of a
dramatic withdrawal at the opening of
-morrow's session.
A met ting of M. Labori's friends, It
was said, will be held at M. Laborl's
house i.. determine whether such a step
is advisable. M. Laborl's withdrawal
from the ease would be tantamount to
a public declaration of his feelings that
the judges have shown a bias against
Drey:':;- and his counsel. The opinion
of the Dreyfusards this afternoon ap-
peals to be opposed to the contem-
plated step, which they think the anti-
Dreyfusards would represent as an ad-
mission of weakness in Dreyfus' case.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press called it the house of M. Labori,
where the advocate's secretary was
questioned with reference to the report
that M. Labori intended to retire from
the defense of Dreyfus. The secretary
was able to give a positive denial to
the story that Labor! would leave his
post, now that the trial was drawing
near a close. Many inquiries on the
subject had been received during the
afternoon.
M. Labori's secretary was asked if
replies by telegraph had been received
from Emperor William or King Hum-
bert in response to the advocate's
messages asking that Colonels
Schwarzkoppen and Panizzardl be per-
mitted to come to Rennes to testily be-
fore the court. He replied that no
message whatever had been received
up to the present time. He thought it
quite possible that Schwarzkoppen and
Panizzardi would not come in person,
but that they would send depositions,
in which case the trial would doubtless
end on Mcmday or Tuesday of next
week.
The various generals and the military'
witnesses who have been In attendance
upon the court-martial are preparing to
leave Rennes, having the order tele-
graphed yesterday by the Minister of
War, General Marquis de Galllfet.
General Roget will take his departure
to-morrow, which is an indication that
the closing speeches of counsel are ex-
pected to begin on Friday.
The exciting episode of the morning's
sitting was a scene In which M. La-
bori, e^erieral Billot, Colonel Jouaust
and Captain Dreyfus participated.
Things had progressed quietly and
even monotonously up to that time.
'La Dame Blanche," with her famous
pearls in her ears and around her neck,
kept whispering to her companion.
Others, who from the first had taken
the keenest interest In every word ut-
tered in the court, seemed bored and
the Intense heal In the room sent sev
eral to sleep. Suddenly, when General
Billot, in low, even tones, again brought
out what many declared is the general's
last card, namely, the complicity of
Dreyfus and Esterhazy, there was a re
markable change of scene. M. Labori,
in terrible excitement and waving his
arms, protested in a ringing voice.
Dreyfus, who had been sitting like a
statue, also jumped to his feet despite
the restraining hand that a gendarme
placed upon his shoulder, and with his
face flaming with passion said, address
ing Colonel Jouaust: "I protest, col
onel; I protest against this odious ac
cusation."
M. I^abori, at the same time, was de
manding to be heard. Colonel Jouaust,
equally determined not to hear him,
called out: "Maitre Labori, I refuse to
allow you to speak."
When M- Labori finally gave up and
Fat down, trembling, he was deathly
pale. _

HOW GUERIN HOLDS THE FORT.
This picture from Petit Bleu shows the manner in which M. Guerin and
* his comrades sleep since their abode was besieged by the police of Paris. t
when the open session of the Dreyfus
' court-martial began at S:SO o'clock. Sena
i tor Trarieux. former Minister of Justice.
resumed his deposition, which hud been
interrupted by the adjournment of the
court yesterday. M. Trarieux took up the
testimony of Savignaud, the witness U r
the prosecution who had asserted th;it he
hud seen letters addressed M. Scheurer
i Kestner. formerly a Vice President of th->
; Senate, by Lieutenant Colonel Picquart
1 whili- Savignaud was Picquart's orderly
in Tunis. M. Trarieux declared that Sa
vigTiaud was a perjurer, and that two of
rs visited Savignaud before the court
i martial opened, M. Trarieux hinting that
the officers had drilled Savignaud on the
testimony he should give.
Savignaud replied, reiterating the truth
of his previous Testimony.
Lieutenant Colonel Picquart then arose
and repeated his denial of Savignaud's
story.
M. Trarieux delivered his testimony in
an emphatic tone. He reviewed the ques
tion of the petit bleu, which, he said, he
was convinced was authentic. He pro
ceeded to comment upon the questionable
role played by Commandant Lauth in the
affair. On the conclusion of M. Trarieux'a
deposition Commandant Lauth confronted
â¢ him. The commandant declared that he
had actetl honestly throughout and that
1 he had not the least doubt of Lieutenant
Colonel Picquart's falsification of the
petit bleu in order to incriminate
hazy.
A striking incident occurred when Com
mandant Lauth. a moment later, asserted
I that Lieutenant Colonel Picquart had al
ways shown the greatest contempt fur the
rs of his bureau, asserting that on
one occasion Picquart had brought to the
general staff In the presence of Mcc
Henry and Lauth a woman. Mme. D .
who "whs the wife of a magistrate, and
i^tuth Intimated Picquart's mistress
Lieutenant Colonel Picquart arose and,
cried. â¢'] protest absolutely."
There arose from the spectators a
chorus of indignant cries of "Canaille."
"Cochon" and "Miserable." The gen
darmes were ordered to suppress the out
bursts of Indignation wmcb had been
: evoked by the conduct of Commandant
j Lauth in publicly naming a woman in a
idaious c< mnection.
General Zuriinden. formerly Minister of
War, followed Commandant Lauth at the
! witness bar. General Zurlinden Bpoke In
iuFtincation of his action while he was
' Military Governor or" Paris and Minister
of War in the matter of the prosecution
of Lieutenant Colonel Picquart. taking
' the ground that the measure was abso
â  lutely necessary in order that the
\ should clear up the charge of forgery
' brought against Picquart. Moreover, Gen
eral Zurlinden said the Minister of Jus
: tlce had persuaded him to send Lieutenant
Colonel Picquart before a military court.
M Trarieux r*-iili>-<i to General Zurlln-
I d^n, reproaching him with Picquart's ten
months imprisonment.
M. Laborl then asked a question of Gen
eral Zurlinden regarding th<> petit bleu.
oel Jouaust, president of the court
martial, refused to put the question, on
the ground that the court wa* engaged
in the trial of Dreyfus and not of Pic
i quart. M. Labor!, however, insisted, tak
ing the ground that the petit bleu dem
onstrated the guilt of Major Esterhazy
and that consequently it was very im
portant for Dreyfus.
M. Labor! then tackled General Zurlin
â  den who admitted that the magisterial
Inquiry showed that the petit bleu was
not tampered with when it first arrived
at the intelligence department, and that
consequently Picquart could not have
I i n guilty, as alleged, of distorting the
; document.
M. Laborl asked that M. Paleologue.
the (-xpert of the Foreign office, be con-
I suited with reference to his reading before
! the court of diplomatic documents which
established Irrefutably the authenticity of
i the petit bleu.
M. Paleologue. who sit? behind the
I, came to the front <>f the stage and
said that he did not know to which docu
ments M. Labori alluded.
"The document," rt piled M. I^abori, "In
which is recounted a conversation be
twee M. Del Caase, former Prime Minis
ter, and Count yon Munster-Ledenburg,
Germany's Minister to Paris, in the course
of whicn Count yon Munster-Ledenburg
had said Colonel Sehwarzkoppen had ad
mitted Oat he sent Major Eaterhazy .1
] number uf telegraphic cards or petit
â  bleus."
M. Paleologue responded that what M.
Labori said wh' 1 quite true and that the
.document belonged to the diplomatic de
partment. As to the petit bleu in ques
-1 lion, added M. Paleologue, Colonel
: Schwarzkoppen could afTirm whether he
wrote it him*. -If or whether he had not
1 seen it; but in any case, M. Paleologue
â  said, he believed it was sent by Colonel
' Schwarzkoppen.
This declaration by the expert of the
Foreign Office created h marked sensation
In court.
M. Trarieux again entered upon a long
statement, in the course of which he said
'â¢ Major Esterhazy was acquitted, not
judged.
Colonel Jouaust stopped M. Trarieux.
saving he must not sjK-ak that way of
ludges
M. Trarlfux rented that he had not re
ferred to judges but to la chose Jugee.
Colonel Jouaust then pointed out that
M. Trarieux was taking M. Labori's place
and making a regular speech for the de
fense.
General Billot now confronted M.
Trarieux in reply to the latter' s criticism
of him. General Billot was much affected
and spoke in a husky voice. He began
by declaring that M. Trarieux had deliv
ered an eloquent oration, but that it was
a special pleading for Dreyfus and
Picquart and an arraignment of former
Ministers. General Billot praised Lieu
tenant Colonel Picquart for his services
In the army and declared that tie haoVtho
greatest confidence in him â a confidence
which, however, he had since been com
pelled to withdraw. Then, discussing
Picquart's Investigation of the suspicions
against Major Esterhazy, General Billot
said: "Even if Esterhaiy should be
proved a traitor, that would not prove
Dreyfus innocent, for in cases bf espion
age it very often occurs that there are
several accomplices."
M. Labori wished to question General
Billot, and an altercation with 'Colonel
Jouaust ensued. Finally M. Laborl cried:
"Allow me to remark. Mr. President, that
it has never been said that Dreyfus had
an accomplice In Esterhazy."
Captain Dreyfus, who heard General
Billot's statement wlih evident excite
ment, also sprang to his feet and shout
ed: "I protest against this odious ac
cusation.
M Laborl again insisted that he be al
lowed to question General Billot. Colonel
Jouaust still refused and a heated wran
gle once more ensued. M. Labori made a
passionate protest against the attitude of
THE SAr>l FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1599.
Colonel Jouaust. who then said: "I de
cline to allow you to speak."
M. Labor] retorted excitedly, "1 bow to
your ruling, but I take note that every
time I put a question that is irresistible
you refuse to allow It."
This declaration counsel for defense de
llvered In a ringing voice, punctuating
liis utterances with striking gestures.
The audience burst Into loud applause
and the greatest excitement prevailed.
Colonel Jouaust said: "If this demon
stration is renewed I will have the court
room cleared. Have you anything more
to suv. M. Labori?"
M. Labori replied: "No, because â and
I speak with the utmost respectâ l am
prevented from putting any Questions
touching the core of the affair. I re
serve the right to take such action as
regard for my responsibility compels me
to take."
This scene was th* 1 climax of the
strained relations which have prevailed
between the president of the court-mar
tial. Colonel Jouaust, and M. Laborl,
principal counsel for the accused, almost
from the very outset of the trial. M.
Labor) bus many times bitterly com
plained that Colonel Jouaust prevented
him fmm putting probing questions, and
for the moment M. Labori abstained from
asking witnesses such questions, fearing
that by so doing he might do more harm
than good to his client. In view of the
manifest irritation displayed by the presi
dent of the court whenever M. Labori
has risen to his feet. In the last few
days, however, the advocate resumed his
former aggressive cross-examination
methods, resulting in to-day's crisis.
M. Labori was extremely excited and
hardly able to contain himsHf with in
dignation, and when afterward asked If
he had any questions to put to other wlt
nesses he replied pertly: "No, nothing
at all."
The court-martial adjourned for the
day on the conclusion of the reading of
Dv P.i !v de i 'lain's .1. -position.
As the audience was leaving the cotirt
room Lieutenant Colonel Picquart's
brother-in-law, (inn. rushed at Com
mandant I-.auth and tried to strike him
for having Introduced the subject of Pic
quart'a mistress In his testimony to-day.
Gendarmes interfered and persuaded M.
Qasi to leave the precincts of the court.
CORCORAN APPEALS
FOR A NEW TRIAL
Many Startling Allegations Made
in the Bill of Excep
tions.
WALLACE, Idaho, Sept. n.-A bill of
exceptions and motion for a new tri.-tl
was Hied to-day by tho attorneys for
Paul Corcoran, who was convicted at the
spring term of court of the murder of
James Cheyne during the riots of
April 29.
The bill of exceptions makes some start
ling allegations regarding the conduct of
the trial jurors, and is supported by the
affidavits of bartenders and waiters, who
claim to have Berved the members of the
jury with drinks of whisky and beer dur
ing the trial. The principal contentions
made by the attorneys for Corcoran ar"
upon the grounds that during the trial
they were refused access to the records
of the proceedings before the Coroner's
jury. These records were wanted for the
cross-examination of three important
witnesses -as it was claimed their testi
mony differed materially from that given
at the Coroner's inquest.
This record was refused the defense by
the Judge, and it is claimed that such a
refusal Is a violation of the constitutional i
rights to a fair and impartial trial. It is !
further claimed that J. H. Forney was
not legally qualified to act as prosecuting !
attorney in the case, he being a resident I
of Latah County and not of Shoshone
County, that the Grand Jury was not
properly summoned, and that the Judge in
delivering his charge to the jury said
they must find beyond a reasonable doubt
that the victim came to his death In
Shoshone County, Idaho, while as a mat
ter of fac-t Cheyne died at the Sacred
Heart Hospital In Spokane.
STANFORD FRESHMEN
DEFEAT SOPHOMORES
Neatly Turn the Tables in a Rope
Rush on the University
Campus.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 6.
âThe liveliest time that Enolnal Hall
has had for several years occurred to
niKht, when the sophomores attempted
to have some fun with freshmen. En
cinal Hall is filled from top to bottom
with probably the largest class of "ba
bies" that has ever entered Stanford.
But the "sophs" did not take this into
consideration when they began to
amuse themselves by making the
"fn shies" dance and sing.
At the instigation of the elder
students the "babies," many of whom
are husky men, rushed for the lawn,
where they were followed by the
"sophs." The scrimmage began, and it
was surprising to see the quantity of
rope that hud been gathered in so
short a time. The freshmen were at a
disadvantage in not knowing their own
men, but, assisted by a couple of lan
terns and much Information by the up
per class men, they succeeded in tielng
up every "soph" who made his appear
ance. Rushing has been practically
prohibited by tho faculty, but to-night's
doing was a good-natured affair, and it
is hardly thought that any serious diffi
culty will arise from it.

BENTHEIM
REITERATES
HIS CHARGE
Insists American Consul
Florschuet Was a Tool
of the Germans.
GIVES FURTHER FACTS
Willing to Aid the Government to
Prove That the Official Dealt
in French Secrets.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ATLANTA, Ga., Sept. 6.â Charles E.
Bentheim to-day reiterated the declar
i ation that he told the absolute truth in
his statement Involving Vice Consul
Florschuetz in the German secret ser
vice work between Berlin and Paris.
"Of course Florschuetz will deny
i this," said Bentheim, "but it can be
I easily fastened upon him. The point in
I the investigation really is this: To ln
! quire in the right direction. The*e is
no use going to Florsehuetz about this
thing. He will naturally deny it and
the rage of the Germans will turn on
us. If Florsehuetz denies his connec
tion with this matter let the question
be put to him:
" 'For what purpose did Florsehuetz
[hand over to me (Bentheim) a money
i order calling for 1500 marks, signed by
I the Emperor? 1
"What the honorable Secretary of
! State, Mr. Hay, says about the Vice
i Consul beginning In 1888 is correct. The
I German Government wanted him made
a Consul, but this position he wa.s not
allowed to fill because he was a Ger
i man. I do not know positively that
' he was cashier of the bank at Sonne
j berg. He was a director. Franz was
! a director and his bank often ligured
in the handling of secret service funds,
as I have told you. 1 will be willing
to respectfully submit to the honorable
Secretary of State the direction in
which to look for convincing evidence
of all that 1 charge.
"1 say again: Florsehuetz was using
his official position as vice and deputy
| consul to aid the German secret ser
j vice in obtaining Information from
! France. He placed his services at the
disposal of the German Becrei service
1 and between the years 1890 and 1.594 he
was actively engaged as confidential
agent of the Becret service. Let the
Secretary of State request the Ameri
can Embassador in London to get per
mission from the Commissioner Gen
eral of Postofflces in London and go to
the village of Holmroe and examine the
1 l J i>st"tti'->' records which are not de
stroyed. Evidence there In black and
white will show the truth of every as
sertion 1 have made."
"What course d<> you suggest for the
securing of information regarding the
German branch of this service?"
"It would be manifestly impolitic to
; make that public. As 1 say, 1 am will
ing to respectfully submit any sugges
tion to an aci redited representative of
the United States Government regard
ing a way in which this matter may )y
feiyeted out. once our hand is shown
the German Government will effectual
ly destroy every bit of evidence which
will yet confirm what I say.
"While it will be difficult to prove
from physical evidence furnished by
the papers themselves that the letter
heads and envelopes were used by Flor
sehuetz, because the papers are in the
secret archives in the War Office in
Berlin, yet evidence can be .secured. If
it can be proved that between 181*0 and
1894 Florsehuetz was engaged in the
purchase of French War Office mer
chandise the presumption that he pros
tituted his office will I"- strong. Flor
sehuetz handled the German secret ser
vice money in this matter. I can give
dates and details regarding the bund
ling of the money."
Bentheim was pressed further for his
recollection of the appearance of the
documents from the French War Office
as they reached him.
"I can recall many of them," he said,
"and I think if 1 were to put myself to
it I could write you a description of the
war vessel as handled by me. You
know at the top of the sheet describ
ing a certain boat would be the word
'Rapport.' This would be underscored
and on a line by itself under this was
generally written: 'Upon the experi
ments made with the Goubet submarine
boat.' Here would follow the mode of
construction and method of maneuver
ing the boat. Over at the left-hand
side of the paper on the bordereau. Bay
two inches, was clear. This was used
for comments on the matter in the re
port. For instance, such notes as
'Could not get models,' 'minimum 1000,'
would be seen. These comments were
found in the description of the sub
marine boat Goubet.
"In cases where the information was
not complete this paper would be tak ?n
by Slgl, who would write in this b.-r
--der, '1000, 5000. 10,000.' This meant
marks and was to be used in procuring
further details. This showed what the
German Government was willing to
pay for It."

NEW YORK, Spt. 6.â A Journal
cable from London says: Ex
citement was caused at the War
Office this evening by the re
ceipt of a dispatch from Jo
hannesburg indicating that General
Joubert was laying plans to rush
troops Into Laings Neck and Newcastle
in advance of the British.
A British spy sent the information,
adding that the Boers were secretly
massing troops near the points men
tioned and other places of strategic
importance. This startling information
had the effect of quickening prepara
tions. This plan of the Boers had been
foreseen and was the subject of the
generals' counsel earlier in the day.
Generals Wolseley, Sir Evelyn Wood
and Sir Redvers Buller held a confer
ence at the War Office to-day on the
Transvaal crisis. General Wood advo
cated immediate occupation in strong
force df Newcastle and Laings Neck.
The places mentioned are of great
strategic importance, he urged, and it
would be as well to take steps to as
sure the prestige of British arms. The
other generals went into a long dis
cussion of the difficulties of transpor
tation in the problem presented. It
was evident that they were deeply im
pressed by Sir Evelyn's earnest advice.
A dispatch from Johannesburg states
that Colonel Schiel, the Boer command
ant there, has written papers advising
calmness. "The public may be sure,"
he adds, "that the Transvaal Govern
ment will take no step contrary to civil
ized international lews and customs."
U >NDON, Sept. 6. â Advices from va- ;
i ions sources to-day indicate that the '
acute tension in all parts of South:
Africa continues. But unless the Boers j
take the initiative, which at present is ]
improbable, it is pretty certain that the j
issue of peace or war lies solely In the
result of Friday's Cabinet council:
hence public attention is centered more '
on the signs of the times as exhibited
at the army stations and the dock- j
yards than in South Africa itself. ,
though news from there is eagerly |
awaited chiefly owing to the uneasy l
feeling that the Boers might end the!
diplomatic tangle by raiding Natal.
It is reported this afternoon that Mr. j
Chamberlain has sent a reply through]
Sir Alfred Milner. Governor of Cape !
Colony, and British High Commission-!
er of South Africa, to the Transvaal 1
Governments latest proposition. The
matter is generally understood to be
a withdrawal of the former concessions
and an initiative agreement for a
further conference. It seems improba
ble that Mr. Chamberlain has done this,
as he would probably have awaited the
PISTOLESI EXPLICIT.
Grand Marshal of the ileception
Parade States His Position.
Th<- following statement by L. C. Pis
tolesi, grand marshal of the recent suc
cessful parade in honor of the Califor
nians who returned "from the Philip
pines, is self-explanatory:
To whom It may concern: The attempt
of the Ev< ning Bulletin to make it appear
thai there is any unpleasantness existing
or thai any has existed between the Na
tive Sons and the citizens' executive com
mlttee may cause a misapprehension In
the minds of Home people not conversant
with the" facts. Jt is but justice to the
gentlemen of the executive committee to
say that from the beginning the Na- i
live Sens hay.- received every assistance
at their hands that has been asked. When
we ask. ii for an appropriation of $2160 for
band music we were allowed $-500, and
that we did not use the whole appropria
tion is no reflection upon the generosity
of the executive committee. We were
asked to let the committee know what we
wanted, as it would cheerfully co-operate
With us in every way in its power to make
the :i4ght parade and the entire celebra
tion a success.
.Mr. Martin and Mr. Lawrence came he
fore our committee in regard to the pa
rade and stated that it was the unanimous
sense of the committee that we should
have full control and that we should
be given all the assistance we required.
Without such assistance the parade would
have fallen short of the success it |
achieved.
It was at my request that the commit
tee rode in the procession, and the enthu
siastic reception given the committee was
:i sufficient indication of the manner in j
which the people regarded its efforts.
] desire to say here that the committee ;
notified me that the Native Sons were i
authorized to secure carriages for the
Governor and his staff, but those gentle
men chose to make their own arrange
ments. Â ,
To show that there was no feeling be
tween Mr. do Young and myself, I may
note that 1 asked the committee to pro
vide for certain expenses connected with
the turning out of discharged soldiers and
sailors The request was granted at once,
Mr de Young making the motion. Car- i
riages were also granted for those unable
to march and it was left to me to assign
them a place In the parade
I might relate further incidents were it
necessary. There has been no unkind or
carping criticism from any source except
from the evening paper mentioned. I saw
the proprietor of said paper personally
on Tuesday night and protested against
the injustice of the statement he permit
ted to be printed, yet on the following day ,
the paper willfully and maliciously re
peated the misstatements in even more
obnoxious terms.
At the meeting of the executive commit
tee this morning 1 appeared before it and
explained certain hills the Native Sons
1-id submitted which had not been item
ized My explanation was satisfactory,
and' all of the bills were ordered paid !
Without any exception. It was explained
to my perfect satisfaction that the com
mittee, being a trustee for the people,
feels the necessity of having its books
kept in such a way that every cent
huidled can be accounted for. and not a
dollar Is paid out for which there Is not
an itemized hill accompanied by a voucher ;
authorizing It.
I also wish to say emphatically that at
no time did the committee refuse to au
dit the hills of the Native Sons and Na
tive Daughters, nor was It intimated that
th.y might not be audited. The commit
tee merely requested that I or some other
authorized representative appear before it
and explain the nature of the unitemizod
bills tnat proper entries might be made
on the hooks of the committee. < ,
On behalf of the Native Sons and Native
Daughters, in recognition of the assist
ance rendered lo us. personally and finan- '
daily I wish to thank the citizens' execu
tive committee and the morning papers, i
the Chronicle, Call and examiner, for ,
their efforts, which were crowned with (
such unqualified success.^ pTSTOLEgi _ I

Dear Sir: I want to add my testimony to your collection of evidence,
pointing out the value of your Kiectric Belt, which I have had for the
past ten years. It cured me of rheumatism years .. ;o, and I have since
found it a good thing for any sort of sickness. If a man has any trouble

New York: I gladly accede to your re
quest to put the Boer side before the
American public. The present agitation
against this republic emanates partly
from a certain section of British residents
tn whom the existence of the republic,
which embraces the most flourishing- parts
of South Africa, is a standing eyesore,
and who suffer from the prevailing- Jingo
mania; partly, also, from mining capital
ists who. not content with having here the
best mining laws in the world, wish also
to have complete control of all legislation
and administration.
The franchise voting question was taken
up by England because it was thought the
republic would nut yield on that point.
Now. the altered franchise does not mate
rially differ from the American. It la
in many respects easier. The agita
tion has become much worse. The object
clearly Is the destruction of our republic
and the complete control of the richest
mines of the world. The press, entirely
controlled by capitalists, spreads unpre
cedented misrepresentation and prejudice
throughout the world against the Boer
republic. We are determined to defend
to the uttermost thru freedom and self
government for which our people have
shed blood in every part of Smith Africa.
Though we have no such powerful friend
as you proved to Venezuela and to other
republics, we have strong faith that th. j
cause of freedom and republicanism will
triumph in the end.

FOURTH-CLASS POSTMASTERS

truth '. until such evidence is sub

In ' o far as we know, there has been
little or no ' r I the free delivery of mail in
the rural districts where a trial lias been made with
the system. Some complaints have indeed been heard
by t ; â  of village stores that the delivery in
jures their tra<i<\ inasmuch as farmers who formerly
â¢ village merchants when they came to \
the postoffice for their mail now make a weekly trip |
to the neighboring town for their purchases, and the !
vill;,. 'Ie custom. E von such complaints,
however, are Few and Far between, and were moM
pronounced when the free delivery was begun than
they have been since the system has been fully tested
and " better understood.
however, there be any such plans as our Eastern
contemporaries announce and denounce, it will be
worth while to utter a note of warning to the pro
moter- of it. The free delivery of mail in thickly
d rural districts is one of the extensions of the |
â  1 service the people justly demand. The experi- |
- they have been made under anything
like favorable conditions have been uniformly suc
il, and the system has proved of great benefit

of fourth clasp postmasters, but for the con- i
I â¢cc of the public, and if any of them feel
rieved by the free delivery system it is in his !

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1899.
INTERNATIONAL LAW.
AT the meeting of the International Bar Associa
tion in Buffalo ex-Senator Manderson dcliv- j
ered an address to justify the Philippine cam
paign. The great need, among the imperialists, of
reasons and arguments in justification of an unde
clared war is shown by the eagerness with which they
seize upon Manderson's speech. His text was a de
cision of the United States Supreme Court, delivered
in 1833, in which that court recognized it as a settled
principle of the law of nations that "the inhabitants
of a conquered territory chance their allegiance, and
their relations to their former sovereigns are dis
-51 lived."
Admitting this, it has no application to the Phil
ippines. In the first place, we did not treat them
conquered territory. Neither in the protocol nor the
treaty were they considered as a conquest. When the {
Peace Commissioners met at Paris to make the treaty I
we occupied Manila and Cavite, and no more. Spanish .
jurisdiction had been ended byconquest. TheFilipii
had conquered the whole of Luzon except Cavite and
Manila, and all of Panay, Negros and Cebu, and, ac
cording to the doctrine of the court stated by
Manderson, their allegiance had passed from Spam
to such government as represented the conquerors of
those four islands. That was the government to
dfcich allegiance passed under the law of nations and
the decision of our own courts. The expulsion of
Spain and the change of allegiance to their own gov
ernment had been accomplished on August 14, 1898.
That government continued in administration of the
civil affairs of the four islands from that time, and
there were no disorders, breaches of personal or prop- j
erty rights, and the islands wove as peaceable as any
nation on the planet. This peace was not broken
until the military forces of the United States broke
it and the "pacification" became necessary.
The Filipino government -.mis as well organized
and far better equipped than was our revolution
government under the Continental Congress, and no
lawyer with a knowledge of international law can
dispute the proposition that legally and by the high
est law allegian to that government, and we
are in the islands simply upon an errand of conquesi
If Spam were in ;â < ssession of all the archipelago
until the treaty was ratified, and if the con
veyance of the Philippines were a "cession,! 1 we
were not asserting a conquest but wore making a
purchase and paying twenty millions for it. We were
buying a country of a/nation that did not own ; t. â¢
and therefore are compelled to wrest it from its right
ful owners by conquest.
It will be better for all parties when these farts r
admitted, for there will b< a general de-ire to go
ahead as rapidly as possible and complete a conquest
the value of which is now unknown and will remain
to be measured after peace comes. Senator Cai
and Colonel Denby, the Secretary of Agriculture and
many other im] ts, are better friend- of the an
nexation than the preachers who are bawling
about God on the tiring line and indulging in other
liemy of that sort. They defiantly admit that it
is a conquest for <'.ollars and cent--, and therefore I
blood spilled in it is not for the flag but for pelf.
Captain John S. Godfrey, who died the other day

JIMENES IN THE SADDLE
GENERAL JUAN ISIDOR JIMENES, with
twenty-seven trunks and a staff of fifty
armed men, ha* at last reached San Domingo
and fulfilled the promise of his manifesto, "The peu
ple want me and they shall have me." The leading
newspaper of tlr: capital has welcomed him with the
happy phrase: "The coming of General Jimenes
completes the evolution. There has been no revo
lution. It is safe to expect an immediate revival of
busiiK
All of these things are promising, but vague. It is
gratifying to know the people of San Domingo have
their Jimenes and that the long fell want is filled, not
by revolution, but by evolution; but there remains
a considerable uncertainty as to what t be next phase
of the evolution will be and what Jimenes will do for
the people and the people do for him when the shout
ing is over and business is resumed.
For the purpose of solving these doubts the New
York Post has interviewed a Mr. Grullon, the chief
agent of Jimenes in that city, and also another gent'e
man described as having been for twelve years i
partner of the general in the firm of Jimenes, Haus
tedt & Co. of Xew York. Both gentlemen are re
ported to have spoken ol the aspirations of the gen
eral* with considerable freedom, and they certainly
crave forth some interesting information. Mr. (inil
lon is quoted as saying: "The long and short of this
affair is â and it is an aspect which has not hitherto
been brought out â that this revolution is a white
man's effort to wrest from the colored element con
trol of the government Heureaux was a negro;
Figuereo is also a negro, and practically all the men
in power are negroes. In short, the negro is supreme
in the government, notwithstanding that the pure
whites of the island â that is, those descended from
Europeans and Indiansâ compose two-thirds of the
population. Rut negro rule might have been tolerable
had not the negroes virtually undertaken to drive the
whites out. By oppression,, confiscation, imprison
ment, murder, and what not, they have tried to make
the island a place a white man cou,ld not live in. The
white men. who comprise also the majority of the
educated, enlightened and liberal people, have con
cluded to take things into their own hands and insti
tute a decent government."
Upon hearing that surprising statement the re
porter naturally asked, "Then the civil war is really
on racial lines?" Whereupon we told both the
agent and the friend of Jimenes hastened to cry out:
"Oh, no, no. We cannot afford to -ay that. There
are too many negroes in the island, and some of them
are educated, good people."
We thus learn the evolution is a white man's revolt,
but not a racial revolt. Next some information was
given concerning the refations of Jimenes to the late
President Heureaux The "friend" said: "Jimenes
himself was on excellent terms with Heureaux. '1 he
latter has said to me, "I have nothing whatever
against Jimenes; I wish he would come here; I will
do everything 1 can to help him.' Hut Jimenes knew
better than to take Heureaux at his word. They were
on most excellent terms, but Jimenes was the only
Dominican whom Heureaux feared at the head of a
revolution, and so he didn't really want him around
in any active capacity."
The business dealings between the two are thus
described: "Jimcne? built a canal, diverted a river
to its old mouth at Monte Christi, reclaimed a large
logwood district from swamps, and in return received
from the government a title to all the district. Then
Jimenes exported logwood, and it was the foundation
of his fortune. By and by Jimenes wrote to Heur
caux that he could no longer make such profits on his
logwood unless the export duties were reduced.
Heureaux accordingly reduced them, and Jimenes
again exported at a great profit. It was throughout
a perfectly businesslike and legitimate transaction.
* * * By and by Jimenes found that he had given
Heureaux ?200,000, and that the latter was demanding
more. He felt that he had reached the limit of his
generosity in this direction, and he refused to give
again. Then he and Heureaux ceased to be such
cordial friends as they had been."
That much of information we obtain from the agent
and the friend of the new President. The rest is
known to fame. Jimenes having decided to give
Heureaux no more money, retired from the reach of
his persuasive friendship. The process of evolution
rked along until Heureaux was assassinated, and
the people wanted Jimenes and got him. Business
will now revive. The logwood trade will nourish
again.
Mining at Keswick appears to be an expensive
luxury. A man was shot dead the other day for filing
en a claim the value of which is considered to be ex
cessive at $i.
THE ALASKAN BOUNDARY DISPUTE.
ONCE more the Alaskan boundary arises out of
the obscuring fogs of diplomacy and shows a
clear outline. It is announced there are good
prospects that arrangements will soon be completed
for determining a temporary line between Alaska and
Canada which will put an end to the conflict of au
thority in the disputed territory until diplomacy at
j its leisure and without disturbance can settle the
whole controversy.
Secretary Hay is reported to be very much grati
fied with the terms agreed upon. It is said he has
convinced Great Britain of the impregnable charac
ter of the position he has assumed and that Great
Britain's friendliness for this country has caused her
t'> make concessions which enable an agreement to be
reached as to the location of the temporary line. The
proposed line will be located at the fork of Chilkat j
River, just above the Indian village of Kiuckwan. j
Other points where the line will be located were
ed upon some months ago and are not under
discussion at this time. The effect of the location of
the boundary line as fixed by the Secretary and prac
tically agreed to by Great Britain will be that the en
tire Lynn Canal will be under American control and
: that Canada will not. under the temporary agreement,
have a port on that waterway.
There is. however, a little fly in the ointment of
that pleasing statement. It appears all of these ex
cellent arrangements are to stand "unless Canada
interposes obstacles." Who shall guarantee that
Canada will not interpo-e obstacles? The Govern
ment of the Dominion is in the position of a small
boy who has a chance to talk big to larger boys with
out danger of getting whipped. Being fairly well
assured the United States and Great Britain will not
go to war over any disturbance Canada can make,
the politicians of the Dominion have been inclined to
profit by their security to make a grand demonstra- ;
tii m of firmness in upholding the claims of Canada
against the aggressions of the United States and the
indifference of the Salisbury Ministry.
Sooner or later, however, the Canadians must come
to their senses, and it may be they have about reached
' that point. Certainly their politicians have done
enough fur campaign purposes. They have thrown
salt "i: the eagle's tail time and again and have hurled i
defiance across the border for months with a roar like
that of Niagara. It i- now time for them to get
down to business. There are many questions of im
portance to be arranged between the two countries. â 
;:r,u nothing can be done to <ettle them until the dis- !
pined boundary be at least temporarily determined
-< that there will be no danger of conflict along the
line. That fact may have some effect in moderating
the Canadian demand for a port on Lynn Canal.
Therefore it is not wholly improbable the Dominion
statesmen may abandon their useless contention and
permit the agreement now announced to be carried
out without further trouble.
The Austrian diplomat who i~ trying to find out
| whether or not he has been insulted by General Roget
| of the French general staff would save himself a whole
lot of trouble by consulting his bank account.
KAISER WILLIAM'S AMBITION.
A WRITER who conceals his identity under the
title "Ignotus" contributes to the August num
ber of the National Review an interesting ar
ticle on the relations between France and Germany,
in which he seeks to explain the motive of the
Kaiser in trying to conciliate the French. The article
shows the author has given considerable study to the
situation, and the theory he sets up has at any rate
the 'attraction of novelty.
A sentence is quoted from the Universal History of
Count Yorck yon Wa'rtenburg, to the effect there
are only four great powers in the world â the United
States, Great Britain, Russia and "Central Europe
under the hegemony of Germany." At the present
time there is no such power as "Central Europe," but
i f is ciainied the Kaiser and the statesmen of Germany
i are trying their best to establish one.
The writer says: "In this connection the, at first
sight, almost unintelligible policy of the Kaiser
toward the United States acquires a new significance.
What, asks the puzzled bystander, had he to gain by
unnecessarily quarreling with a state of such gigan
tic strength? The answer is that he wished to as
sume the position of the champion of Europe against
the transmarine powers. To Europe the United
States before 1898 appeared like some huge and
drowsy monster, which spent all its energy in nib
bling the lion's tail during its rare moments of wake
fulness. No one objected much to this. But when
the beast shook itself and planted one paw on the
Spanish possessions in the West Indies and another
on the Philippines it became an object of real terror
to European statesmen." The Kaiser was prompt to
seize the moment of alarm to step forth as the Pro
tector of Europe â not that he intended any serious
conflict with the United States, but solely because he
wished all Europe to took to Germany for leadership.
The policy described in the article appears fantas
tic, but it is by no means an ignoble one. Europe
has nothing to fear from the United States, but it may
have something to fear from Russia, and the building
up of a great power on that continent under the
virile leadership of Germany would be a good thing
not only for Europe but for the world. It is quite
possible some such ambition may be in the brain of
the Kaiser. At any rate he is acting wisely in con
ciliating the French and making ready to meet any
emergency that may arise. A world divided between
the four powers, United States. Great Britain, Ger
many and Russia, is something quite possible in the
frture, and even at this time the subject is interesting
as a speculation.
"IS SUICIDE A SIN "-IN POLITICS?
SAYS PENSION COMMISSIONER EVANS
IS A FAITHFUL PUBLIC OFFICER
Editor of The Call: Allow me, a member of the Grand Army, through your
valuable columns to enter my protest against the effort now being made by mem
bers of the Grand Army to remove from office Pension Commissioner H. Clay
Evans. It is evident by the Commission' r's !:st report that he fearlessly and with
fidelity discharged the duties of his high office. Millions of dollars are being paid
out annually to men who have secured pensions through fraud.
Hy the system adopted by Mr. Evans the money expended in his department
during the past year was cut down ST.."-"". 1 "". and many of the pension attorneys
are disgruntled and go mourning about the streets. Many Grand Army men have
been misled by the plausible representations of the attorneys into hostility to the
Commissioner.
There are in force at the present time 001.M9 pensions, including those of the
Spanish-American war. Thirty-seven thousand and seventy-seven new pensions
during the year have been Issued. There was a ret reduction of 21^">. This is the
first decrease since the Civil War. and It is not attributable to losses by death
but to a vigorous system of examining claims.
Therefore, let the good work go on, and I believe e^ery man who is entitled to
a pension will receive it, and that the attack upon the Commissioner is a mer
o nary one. J- L. LYON,

WEAK LUNGSâ A. 8., San Rafael. Cal.
It is claimed that the climate of South
ern California is benellcial to persons af
fected with weak lungs because the at
mosphere is clear, allowing the full force
of the sun's rays, and because at the
same time the dryness has a compensat
ing effect by taking up the moisture from
the system, and the further fact that the
temperature is uniform. As to what part
of the section of the State is best for
those affected with weak lungs depends
upon conditions, some individuals re
quiring an exceedingly dry atmosphere
and others one in which there is a little
moisture. These places that are in prox
imity to the ocean are not as beneficial
to such patients as localities farther in
the interior. The sudden climatic
changes in the Philippines render them
an undesirable place for persons whose
lungs are weak. A person seeking a suit
able place to take up a residence in on
account of weakness of lungs should, be
fore deciding, consult a first-class phy
sician, who will be able to suggest which
is the most suitable locality.

needed "oil" for their political machinery,

INHERITANCE TAX LAW
IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
Decision by Judge York in the
Superior Court of Los
Angeles.
PASADENA. Sept. 6.â ln the Superior
Court of Los Angeles to-day Judge York
declared the inheritance tax law uncon
stitutional. The case was that of Miss
Fannie Bixby of this city, who sued to
have the valuation of an annuity reduced.
Mrs. Mary E. Howard, deceased, left
Miss Bixby the interest at 7 per cent on
$5000, the principal to go to gome educa
tional institution. The Insurance Com
missioner figured that Miss Bixby, now
over 60. would live long enough to make
her annuity worth $2900. The inheritance
tax is 5 per cent. Judge York ruled that
such a law is unconstitutional. Judge J.
H. Merriam of this city, attorney for Miss
Bixby, received the decision to-day.

MURDERERS OF
DAVIS CONFESS
Robbery the Motive for
the Crime.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIEI.D, Sept. 6.â Kern County
jail certainly holds the menâ Francisco
Duarte and Pedro Barraganâ who mar-
dered Barber John C. Davis on October
18, 1897. The fact developed to-day at the
preliminary hearing of Barragan.
Some time ago Duarte made a confes
sion at Hanford that Barragan told him
he killed Davis for robbery when he was
traveling and stealing with Barragan.
To-day Duarte repeated the story in
court. John E. Malcom of Ventura
County also swore that Barragan told
him he had killed Davis." The testimony
disconcerted Barragan. When the mur
dered man's widow took the stand Barra
gan broke down and shed tears. After be
ing held to answer and returned to Jail
Barragan went to pieces and on request
was returned to court and coolly told the
details of the cold-blooded killing. He
made out Duarte to be the instigator and
guilty one. He told how they arrived
rrm' Hanford on stolen horses about an
hour before the killing, and after getting
whisky started away and then returned
for ropes and money. They tied their
horses near Davis' home and started up
town after ropes. Then. Barragan claims,
Duarte said: "We will go up the street
and the first man we meet we will hold
up and rob." After going a block or so
they met Davis, got within six feet of
him and shot him. Duarte claims that
Barragan did the shooting and divided
the booty, ti
Tne Sheriff's office is satisfied that Bar
ragan is the guilty one and will yet own
it. Sheriff Borgwardt of Kern County and
Sheriff Buckner of Kings, who worked up
the case, are receiving great praise. They
have been working on. the clew since last
September.
VALLEY ROAD RAPIDLY
NEARING COMPLETION
STEEL FOR* ALL* BRIDGES NEAR
LY READY TOR DELIVERY.
Officials Make a Tour of Inspection
and Make a Report on Progress
of Construction Along
the Line.
Vice-President A. H. Payson, Director
F. W. Van Slcklen, Director W. A. Bls
sell and Chief Engineer W. B. Storey re
turned yesterday from a trip of inspec
tion' over the line of the Valley road as
far as Stockton.
They found the work progressing 1 fa
vorably all along the line, and such sat
isfactory advancement has been made
that they now consider the completion of
the road to its Point Richmond terminal
by January 1 a foregone conclusion.
While the work on the Middle River has
only advanced as far as the placing of
piles, yet the foundations for the Old
River bridge are all In place and the
work on the bridge over the San Joaquin
has advanced so far that the laborers are
now employing themselves on the super
structure, the steel for which has now
arrived from the factories of the East.
Although the factories have not as yet
delivered the orders lor the steel to be
utilized In the construction of the other
two bridges, yet the first shipment is ex
pected to arrive within the next three
weeks, and then the work can be pushed
ahead so as to allow of them being fin
ished within a short time after the struc
ture which is to span the San Joaquin.
Work on the new freight depot which
is to emerge from the reconstruction of
tho old Hathaway warehouse will
shortly be commenced, and when once
begun it will be but a matter of a few
weeks to rush It through so as to open
offices in it and have everything ready
for the first trainload of merchandise to
arrive in this city.
The only matter experiencing any great
delay is the new boat to be used
on the ferry service between this city and
Point Richmond. The contract is with
the Union Iron Works, and thus far that
institution has only succeeded in com
pleting two boiler tubes and a link of the
wheel chain. So there is now no telling
the exact date or even the year that will
witness the launching of the n#w oraft.
However, the Ocean Wave, the vessel
brought down from the Sound for that
purpose, has been put in excellent trim, '
and is all ready to take care of the pas
sengers as soon as the cars of the Val
ley road shall haul them to the Point
Richmond wharf.
Vice President Payson yesterday Issued
the following circular of elections and ap

Music for Nervousness.
Some scientists have claimed that music has i
the power to soothe the nÂ»rves. But the quick- !
est way to cure nervousness is to strengthen
the nervous system. We know of nothing j
which will accomplish this quicker than Hos- ;
tetter's Stomach Bitters. It Is the one mcdi- !
cine that is successful above all others In the
treatment of blood, stomach and liver diseases.

CARRIE SANKEY
HAS DEFEATED
HER GUARDIAN
Recovers Judgment of
All Her Property.
WAS INFLUENCED BY COGGINS
HE MUST ACCOUNT FOB. ALL
MONEYS SHE ADVANCED.
Judge Belcher Decides That Question
able Advantage Was Taken of
Plaintiff's Youth and
Simplicity.
Charles Coggins and his wife Mary
must grlve their presents back. Judge
Belcher yesterday rendered a decision
canceling deeds to nearly $40,000 worth of
property executed by Carrie E. Sankey
to her guardians, Mr. and Mrs. Cogglns.
several years ago. Miss Sankey made the
deeds, it was proved during the trial,
while under the undue influence of her
guardians.
When Miss Sankey was but 13 years of
age her uncle, Samuel Sankey, died In
Pennsylvania leaving a large estate. She
Inherited property worth about $40,00*3,
and as she was at that time employed in
the Cogglns household she became their
ward. Soon after his appointment as
guardian Cogglns. the testimony showed,
immediately began to systematically
wrest the property from her. Miss
Sankey was made to pay all the bills of
the household under the belief that she
was compelled to do so, diamonds were
bought and she footed the bills, and the
Coggins home was furnished in palatial
style. One by one her real estate hold
ings were transferred to Coggins and his
wife and a short time ago, when Carrie
blossomed into womanhouu, she awoke to
the realization that she was penniless.
She immediately brought suit to recover
all the property transferred to her guar
dian and from that time no longer lived
in the Coggins household.
Coggins and his wife contested her
action on the ground that they executed
all of the deeds in g/jod faith and "for
Berviees rendered." Nearly ten days were
consumed in the trial of the case, and
during that time it developed, in addition
to the fact given heretofore, that the so
called services which Coggins valued at
$4u,iaw were practically worth nothing. In
giving judgment Judge Belcher decided
all points of the controversy in Miss
Sankeys favor. He held that the d
were made under undue influence and
without consideration, and in addition to
ordering their cancellation the court
ordered the defendants to account to the
plaintiff for all properties which have
come into their hands through purchase
by Miss Sankey as well as moneys re
ceived from her "for her use and benefit."
Concert Season Opens To-Night.
The concert season will be inaugurated
at the Sherman and Clay Hall to-night
when Miss Meta Asher, a young San
Francisco pianist, who distinguished her
self with Moszkowski and the Royal
Academy in Berlin, and Harry Samuels,
the local violinist who achieved fame in
Brussels with Cesar Thomson, will play
for *he first time since their return to
their native city. They will be assisted
by Arthur Weiss, 'cellist, and Arthur
Fickensher, accompanist. A programme
of unusual excellence will be rendered.
The house has been sold out.

FINE PLAY OF

AT DEL MONTE
Californian Loses to DA'ight Davis

DEL MONTE. Sept. 6.â The singles
championship tournament between the
â  and Atlantic tennis magnates Is
at an end. Out of sixteen matches played
the WestwnerÃ have captured two, hoth
by the skillful playing of Sumnor Hardy,
who demonstrated his ability to-day In
no mean fashion. After a gruelling
m.a'ch played yesterday afternoon with
Whitman, the champion of the United
B, he forced Dwight Davis, who
ranks second on the list of fennis top
notehers, to extend his prowess In a five
set match. Sumner Hardy has proved
his right to be classed with tho best the
country has produced, and nothing but
praise for hi? clever racket play is heard
nr Del Monte to-night.
Davle, although topped by Whitman in
Eastern championship tournaments, is
a harder man for the Westerners In *<?n
--iils strife than Is the champion hin.self.
IliÃ Btyle of play Is different from any
thing to which they are accustomed. He
is a veritable Trojan, ever on the war
path, and always looking for subjects of
slaughter. His terrific smashing and mer
ciless drives won his matches from the
Pacific Coast men before the game had
fairly started.
But It was different In the case of Sum
ner Hardy. This was the last contest of
the day and the sole real struggle of the
tournament. Previous to thfs match
Hardy had disposed of Ward and Wright,
the two lesser lights of the Eastern ten
nis firraami'iit. It was predicted by all
that the battle would be well worth poc-
ti p and the court on w..ich It was played
i\a.-= crowded when game was called.

Gallant is one of the most promising of j
the young dogs, and is just getting his ed

The sport was of high class, the dogs

FOUR MEN MISSING.
There are a couple of mysterious dis
appearances on the water front. A pris
oner on the German warship Geier is gone,
and with him went a small boat belonging
to the Union Iron Works. Bill Spear, a
boatman, and two passengers whom he
look out on <.he bay last Monday night in
Jack Hurley's boat are also missing and
nu trace of men or boat can be found.
The German sailoi had been court-mar
tial. (1 and confined in the brig. He got out
of his prison and made his escape in the
dingy used by the workmen of the iron
works. Neither man nor boat can be
found, and the supposition is that the
eailor sunk the boat after making his es
cape. No attempt is being made to re
capture the man, but the Union people
would like to recover the boat.
Last Monday night Bill Spear, accom
panied by a soldier and a one-legged man,
but in an app< arance at the clay street
eteps. They were all under the influence
of lkiuor. and Spear asked for the loan of
Hurley's boat. He was at first refused.
He final] v secured the Whitehall and he
and his .two companions got in and rowed
away. Neither boat nor men have been
seen since. Hurley seems to think that
the three men are at Sausalito carousing,
but if they do not turn up to-day a search
party will be organized.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J.NooaaD, IW7-1023 Mission.

NILGAR FIRST
FOR THE DEWEY
SELLING STAKE
Daymont Captures the 2:17 Class
Special Trot After an Excit
ing Brush.
St.-cial Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 6.â Business is
picking up in the weather line, and before I
the week passes the mercury In the ther- i
mometer bids fa ir to bump the top of the
glass. The grand stand this afternoon at
Agricultural Park was well filled with the
fair sex, attired in stunning Bummer suit
ings, and in the rin^r the bookies experi
enced the liveliest betting session of the j
meet. There was little growling over the j
prices laid, and the books finished in the ;
"place," the crowd displaying rare form In
landing on the winner.
In the harness events John A, the brown
son of Wayland W, enjoyed a walkover, j
and Lottie captured the -:I'l class trot im
pr< ssively. Two days' work in succession, '
however, was asking too much ol Mamie
Riley, for she lost the ".special" to Day
mont. '
Diminutive Midlove, favorite for the
Dewey selling stake, tound the route too
far, the prize falling to Nilgar. Cromwell,
the sizzimg choke tor the mile-and-a-six
teenth run, was led out by New Moon,
and in the windup round Manzanilla and
Mafada were headed over the line by i'an
amint, Thorpe riding one of his best lin
tshes.
After John A had made a trip around
the elliptic for the 2:20 class pacing stake
the eight starters in the 2:'sz trot were
called. After hr-r Impressive victory at
Oakland Lottie looked to be "Hawkins'
horse," and Bold a 10 to 6 favorite over her
field. Colonel X X, over which Billy Jon
athan held the ribbons, had a respectable
following, and alth"iigh the Colonel did
not win he put his foot down In a way
that commanded respect. The necessary
three heats to draw the long end of the
purs.- were rÂ«el<-d off without effort by the
favorite, Spencer handling her to perfec
tion. Dora Doe, which annexed second
money, stepped three nice heats, and in
the tiiird. Colonel X R, finishing second,
seemed to be getting just warmed up to
his work.
The special trot for horses eligible to
the 2:17 class had bettors guessing before
it was over. For the first heat the books
marked up 4 to 5 on Mamie Riley and 6 to
."> on Daymont, this pair looking to be the
most eligible. Charley Bunch, the "Beau
Brummel of the Hike," came out wearing
a wise 4x4 smile behind Dr. Frasse, a 4 to 1
choice, and led from wire to wire in 2:18.
Daymont went high into the air at the
llrst turn, and Mamie Riley stubbed her
toe soon after passing the half, linishing
fourth.
The betting now became nervous and
fretful. Mamie Riley was held at 6 to 5,
with even money chalked against Day
mont and Dr. Frasse. In this heat Mamie
Riley was on her good behavior, and pass
ing the Doctor in the stretch she won
easily. Daymont once more made a bal
loon ascension at the turn.
The heat winner was now made an over
whelming choice. When the horses ap
peared for the second heat "HI" Hogo
boom had replaced his brother behind
Daymont, and with encouraging results.
In the drive from the head of the stretch
home Daymont outfooted both Mamie
and the Doctor, taking the heat without
effort by a couple of lengths.
The Doctor shot his bolt, and with Ma
mie Riley displaying signals of distress
Daymont looked a good thing for the
fourth heat. Closing favorite, he broke
at the turn and seemed out of it. At the
far turn, though, Mamie Riley left her
feft. allowing Daymont to get up and
eventually win In a jog. Dr. Frasse fin
ished second, securing second money.
The thoroughbreds now went to the bat.
Only three started for the Dewey selling
stake at a mile. Midlove closing favorite
ever Nilgar and Jennie Reid. The talent
figured that the first choice and Nilgar
would chase away in front, after which
the Burn entry would come on and win.
but it did not so happen. Midlove sailed
away In the lead, opening up several
lengths oT daylight, with Ward on Nilgar
taking matters easy. At the stretch the
leader was all out, and Nilgar assuming
c mmand disposed of Jennie Reid with
little to spare. The books laid up little
coin, as Joe Terry and his friends spread
their coin about on the winner.
Cromwell had been passed around all
day as the, real thing for the mile and a
sixteenth selling run, which caused him
to be set up an even-money chance. The
chestnut ran a good race after his long
rest, but was headed from start to finish
by the S to 1 shot New Moon, well rated
by young Mounce. Fortis met with his
usual streak of bad luck, making a game
effort from the far rear and finishing a
close third.
Nine platers went to the post In the final
number, a six furlong sprint, decided un
der selling conditions. Manzanilla. Ma
fada and Panamint nil came in for heavy
hacking, the first named closing a slight
favorite. After being cut off on the back
stretch Thorpe, astride Panamint, hooked
up with Mafada and Manzanilln the last
furlong, and In a very exciting drive was
first by a neck. Mafada downing the fa
vorite a short head for the place.

SHAMROCK WILL TRY
HER NEW SAILS TODAY
NEW YORK, Sept. 6.â The expected
trial of the Shamrock under bigger rig
did not take place to-day, partly owing
to the arrivnl of the new tender, the
Plymouth, and partly to a breeze which
, Sir Thomas Lipton thought was a bit too
' stiff for the test which he had in mind.
To-morrow will probably witness the
trial. Consideration for his men was an
other factor which served to delay the
| trial under racing rlf?. The crew of the
â  Shamrock had been quartered on the
Nonowantuc, a vessel which Sir Thomas
J discovered was too small for their com
! fort. He accordingly chartered the pro
i peller Plymouth, a vessel larpre enough
ito accommodate 1000 passengers. The
I'lvmouth arrived from Boston early to
day, and proceeding to the Horseshoe
tied Up to the Nonowantuc. The Sham
i rock's crew was then told to move into
' Its more commr.dious quarters, and dur
ln'ff the forenoon the sailors were kept
busy shifting belongings and establishing

STAR POINTER
DETHRONED AS
PACING KING
Game Old Joe Patchen Wins a
Magnificent Race at the Em
pire City Track.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept fi.â Fifteen thou
sand enthusiastic spectators were at the
Empire City trotting track to-day to see
the grreai race between the pacers Star
Poii â¢â¢ i. .Jim- Patchen, John R. Gentry and
Searchlight. The grandstand was crowded
to the guards, the lawn was black with
people and In the Infield there were hun
dreds <>f v. â hides. In the betting ring
there was a surging crowd only too anx
ious to bet 100 to 3Q on Star Point* r
against the field, until poolselllng was
stopped by the local authoritiesâ which,
however, did not interfere with the books
and backers were .still able to put on
their money. When McCleary appeared
behind Star Pointer he received a rous
ing cheer, !>ut when Joe Patchen, with
ills old lctmiliar white nose and face,
came up the stretch the applause was
still louder, and when the haniisoine little
bay Stallion, John K. Gentry, turned into
the stretch the whole grandstand arose
and applauded.
Searchlight, the great son of Dark
Night, who Is looked upon as the coming
champion, was brought to the Judges'
stand and it was announced that he was
not in racing condition and would not
be a starter.
Three times they came down for the
word, but each tune the starter realized
that they were not exactly on their
stride. At the fourth attempt they came
down like a triple team, and when the
word "Go" was given Pointer at once
started out to win the heat. It was soon
snt-n that Joe Patchen was in racing con
dition, und he hur.g on to the favorite's
wheel wiih the grim determination of a
veteran who never knows when to stop.
Around tlu< back stretch the conflict was
close and exciting, and the public almost
lost Bight "f John K. Gentry, as he was
several lengths behind. Around the top
turn Star Pointer appeared to gam, but
it was simply an optical delusion, and
when the mighty pair swung into the
Btretch it was apparent to everybody that
they were about to see one of the most
magnificent races of the century.
On they came, Star Pointer on his cour
agi- and Joe Patchen d'-siring to beat his
old and mighty antagonist; but try as he
would he could not <iuite get there, Star
Pointer landing a winner by a neck in
Joe Patchen and Star Pointer were both
together, with John R. Gentry about a
length back, when the word was given in
the second beat, and the positions re
mained practically unchanged to the quar
ter, where Patchen assumed the lead and
held it to the wire in spite of the deter
mined effort of McCTeary, who was driv
ing Star Pointer. Patchen won by a
length, with Gentry several lengths in
the rear. Time. 2:02? 4 . This was the fast
est mil<' paced in a race this season.
There was now a rush to cover among
the spectators, who recognized that the
old-time pacing king was to be dethroned,
and they made no mistake. As soon as
the word was given Joe Patchen started
out to complete his victory, and he did it
in a most effectual manner. Star Pointer
broke so badly that he was distanced, and
John R. Gentry was utterly unable to
compete with the horse that he beat at
Rochester and which beat him at Goshen.
The time of the last heat was 2:O4Vi- It
was announced that Star Pointer would
never race again.
The regular programme began with the
2:22 trotting class, for which there were
eight starters, and Senator L was plunged
upon as the favorite at 100 to 40 for the
field. It was simply a runaway race, as
Senator 1., won In straignt heats with four
or five lengths to spare.
In the 2:10 mile dash for trotters the
gray gelding Success was the favorite at
even money, but the bay gelding Alvos,
owned by Xathan btraibs and driven by
Thompson, took the lead at the half and
came home a very easy winner in 2:O9Mt.
The 2:14 trottlnsr class wound up the
days sport. In a field of twelve the black
mare Rubber was the favorite, and she
never gave her backers any cause to
worry, as she simply walked away from
her field, winning in 2:10)4. Results:

Thirty-first was on dress parade on
the Infantry parade ground. In the
meantime two battalions of the Ihirty

The Tone w Wall Street.
The New Tork circular of Henry Clews says: ,
"The general tone of the local market con- j
tinues good. Confidence in a broader and more
active market during the autumn ie almost uni- j
versa). This, of course, is based upon the ex- ;
traordinary wave of prosperity which extends
over the whole country, and which as yet !
Shows no signs of having spent Its force. The
Iron and kindred Industries are making a won
derful record; our whole history fails to show
a parallel. Haw materials, such a* pig iron,
copper and tin, show advances from lowest <
prices of from 50 to 100 per cent. Finished
product*, of course, show no such rise; but in
many Instances price is a secondary condition
with buyers, delivery being the main want.
So far, high prices do not seem to have check- â 
ed business, and there has been a remarkable i
absence of speculative buying. Later on these |
conditions must check purchases and defer re- â 
pairs Improvements and new enterprises until
values recede to a normal basis; but this stage
of affairs has not yet been reached. Until It :
approaches we are not likely to witness any
Important recession In the stock market.
â¢â¢Railroad earnings continue making satis- ,
factory gains, giving rise to all Borts of hopes i
regarding Increased dividend?. Some of these
are likely to meet with disappointment: for [
present conditions mean Increased costs in j
operating that will materially modify unrea
sonable expectations. A little skepticism re
garding dividend rumors will do not harm.
Some of the best railroad stocks are held at .
prices that offer slight chances for further |
profits. As already Intimated in these advices, j
however, there ar-? a number of low-priced Is- i
sues of reorganized properties which had been
more or less neglected and which must show
large appreciation as they approach from a
non-dividend to a dividend-paying basis.
"The market Is likely to have the support |
of big operators for some weeks to come; and
as these return from summer resorts dealings
will be resumed with greater activity. Com
paratively little attention is being paid to crop I
reports. It is certain, however, that we shall j
have sufficient wheat and corn for home and
foreign wants; and that our farmers will ob- i
tain reasonably good prices for their crops, j
Prosperity Is shining upon the fields of the ;
West as well as up the mills of the East."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6.â St. Paul was the cen- i
tral figure In the market to-day. The publica
tion of the annual report with Its great detail '
of facts and figures 1 , all showing extraordinary j
prosperity was the motive of the buying, which I
was very large and which carried the price 'â 
Steadily upward nearly 2 points. So wide a I
movement in a standard stock of St. Paul's i
character was looked to to arouse some sym- i
pathetic strength in the general market. The i
Kt. Paul movement in the upper stages of the ;
advance showed some signs of manipulation ]
lor the purpose of sustaining the general mar- |
ket. There was quite free selling wherever
there was a notable advance. in price, and th*
last hour was given over to an active realizing ;
movement, which clipped off >4 of St. Paul's j
gain and carried prices generally below last I
Slight's level. The dump In call money to 6
per cent induced the realizing. The exceptions
â¢were a number of usually obscure stocks,"
which were marked up In quite a sensational
manner Tennessee Coal dashed up and down
In an erratic manner all day, climbing 9VÂ» i
points In the first hour and dropping again to j
â within 3 points of last night. The feverish de- I
maud for this stock is attributed to a large i
short interest which finds itself obliged to set
tle with a practical corner In the stock, accord-
Ing to current rumor. This is Wall street's :
Â« (Tort to explain the movement, which seems I
extraordinary without it in a stock which has I
paid no dividend for twelve years, which has
a preferred stock ahead of It on which six !
years' dividends have accumulated and are
payable before a dividend i. due on the com
mon. The movement In Colorado Fuel, which
reached about 4 points, was in close sympathy
â with Tennessee Coal, as was that of 3 points
In Hocking Coal. There were rather rensa
tlonn! advances also in Pullman, the Buffalo,
Rochester and Plttsburg stocks, which gained
about- 7 points each, and Colorado Midland j
preferred. Southern Pacific and Central Pacific
recovered about" 1!4 of their recent declines, ;
and the Southwestern stock:; and coalers ad- j
vanced temporarily, but more than lost the j
pain. Sugar underwent the same experience,
rising 2 points on the declaration of the regu- !
jar dividend, and then reacting an extreme 3*4.
The New York municipal stocks all weakened !
during the day, Brooklyn Transit having de
clined 2"i after an Initial rise, and. Consoli- I
dated Gas shewing a loss of ZSi. New York ;
Airbrake dropped 3 points. Republic Steel,
after gaining 1%, dropped abruptly 3>4. and
American Smelting was conspicuously weak.
The marked activity of the trading was very
unevenly distributed, but brought forward
quite a number of usually Inactive stocks.
There was no change in the money market
to day. Call and time money rates were quite
stiffly held. There was a further deposit of
$150,000 at the sub-treasury for shipment to
New Orleans. Exchange at Interior points in- |
dicate pressure on this center for funds, and
IhfÂ» sub-treasury continues to absorb cash from,
the banks. Notwithstanding the hardness of
money here and the somewhat easier tone in
London, sterling exchange was firm In New
York and advanced a fractional % on actual
business.
The bond market was quiet, but prices were
well held. Total sales, par value, $2. 367, 000.
United States bonds were unchanged on bid
quotations. \

Chicago Wheat Market.
CHICAGO, Sept. Iâ Wheat opened , un
changed for December and a little lower lor
September, the latter on account of heavy re
ceipts in the Northwest. Little wheat was
' offered for sale, and shortly after the open-
Ing the change in the aspect of outside mar
' kets, which have been relatively weaker than
Chicago for some time past, but which to-day
i ...... comparatively stronger, Induced some
cowering by the more timid shorts, and a good
advance in prices took place. December
. â â .;â '. at 71Â® 7114 c and advanced to 71%fff71<>tiC.
while September opened 'Ac lower at sÂ»c5 Â»c and
advanced to 70**0. The advance was sufficient
I to Induce realizing, which carried prices back
fractionally, but after a long period of com
parative dullness, during which December
hung around 71U@71%c. the continued strength
of the Northwest and other outside markets
and the improvement in the export demand
increased the volume .of trade in the specu
lative market and again advanced prices. The
strength shown by September was especially
noticeable. There was a good demand for
this from elevator people and shorts, and the
spread between September and December nar
! rowed to l'.ic. The strength was in spite of
the liberal country movements and free offer
ings. Buying by shorts was quite heavy dur-
I ing the late trading, and the best prices of
'. the day were reached shortly before the close.
December advanced to 71% c and closed at 71%
; @71% c. September sold at 70%'q"70%c and
; closed at 70% c ..
Corn was steady for December and about
steady for deferred futures. Reports of seri-
I ous damage by hot dry weather were received,
! and lake rates were reduced about lie, help-
I Ing the corn shipper that much. A premium
over September was bid for cash, but it was
difficult to get. Reports of rain In Illinois and
a general desire to realize caused an easier
feeling during the li>Her â  part of the session.
December closed lie higher.
A fair general trade was done in oats.
Prices in the main were influenced by the
action ' of wheat and corn and ruled a little
higher throughout. December closed %c high
er. September closed 14@lic higher.
Provisions were fairly 'active and strong,
helped' most by an excellent cash demand,
particularly for lard. There was some realiz
ing through commission houses, but prices ad
vanced steadily under a good general demand
and closed at about the top. Cables were
higher and confidence In present market prices
was expressed. At the close October pone
â was 12& C higher, lard 5@714c higher and ribs
121-ic higher.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Sept. Â«.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
The trade as a whole reports a quiet market
during the past week, but a few houses have
consummated some good-sUed deals, and as a
result the total sales of the week aggregate a
large total, one house alone disposing of about
2,000,000 pounds of wool, comprising I. SOU, 000
I 11 is of Montana. Most houses report a
small business, but there Is no diminution In
the strength prerlously shown, ami wo .is con
tinue to be stiffly held, generally at top fl
ares. Manufacturers, It appears, have been
testing the market for all It is worth, ami are
doubtless satisfied that they have had a strong
market to butt against. AH cheap wools are
practically eliminated and old mothy woola
have been pretty well cleaned and gone Into
consumption, so that the markets present a
clean stock and a price whi. h la low to-day
compared with that of other countries, particu
larly on fine wools. There has been eonpnler
able looking around on the part of manufactur
ers and lota of sample bags have been taken,
which it is believed, will lead to a good busi
ni ss In the course Of a week or two. Manufac
turera are buying only such wools as they need.
however, and little speculative tendecy 1b
noticeable in the market to-day.
The sales of the week in Boston amounted to
6 I'M 800 pounds domestic and 4."'\000 pounds
foreign, a total of 6. 640, 'W0, against a total of
3 955 000 for the previous week and a total of

Hay and Feed stuffs.
There Is .no change In Fe.edstuffs.
. The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"Matters continue rather uninteresting, with
no improvement, of any kind, either in the de
mand or prices, for any particular grade. It
Is true that receipts of choice Wheat Hay are
somewhat light and it may be that this par
ticular grade will be In good demand and sell
ing for a somewhat better figure within a
short time. We still note a fair demand for
good quality red or black 4 cultivated Oat Hay;
other than these two particular varieties there
is no especial grade that Is sought for or that
sells for even a fair price.
"Reports from many localities are to the
effect that there Is yet a large amount of Hay
to be marketed that cannot find storage room..
This makes us look for a rather gloomy mar
ket until the Hay is all marketed or under
cover. \fter that time It is all a matter of ]
speculation. Should the foreign demand or a
demand from the southern portion of the State
increase we may possibly see a range of prices
j .*; or $3 per ton in advance of the present range.
! This cannot be determined at the present time.
j and on the whole the prospect is not at all en
couraging to holders. It is generally conceded j
that after the rains set in prices will advance
enough to cover the expense of storing, in
surance, etc."

DENY THAT A
COMBINE HAS
BEEN FORMED
Unified Six Merely De-
sire Action.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 6.
Some surprise was manifested to-day
when it became known that the City
Council had fixed the tax levy. More sur
prise was manifested at the manner in
which it was done. It If really the first
thoroughly businesslike proceeding con
nected with any big measure that the
present Council has carried out.
The animated debate of last night
shows that when occasion requires the
Council can break apart and that Fix
membersâ Messrs. Mott, Bar stow, Meese,
Schafer. Kramm and (Jirard, which is a
majority of eleven â can be depended upon
to act definitely. All of the six who voted
together last night declare that there is
no combination among them but that they
rely passed to print the tax levy ordin
ance because they were tired of talking
night after night and accomplishing noth
ing. The committee of the whole was to
have discussed the tax levy t'. -night, but
as the matter has been disposed of it is
now entirely out of thÂ« hands of the com
mittee.
All the pet schemes that have been
talked over during the past month disap
peared with th( vote. Mr. Rowe's visions
of Improvements, in independence square
faded away: Mr. lor's desire to per
manently reconstruct a >â¢ ctlon of Tele
graph avenue and call It .1 boulevard also
disappeared; Mr Gfrard's second tire en
gine for the annexed district went up In
smoke, although he was one of the six
who hurriedly closed up the tax levy
business.
That little meeting last Saturday night
presents a very strong contrast to a little
gathering held a few months ago at th
homo of Councilman Taylor. On the lat
ter occasion nearly all the Councilmeii
were unanimous on whatever was pro
posed It was the moat beautiful gather
ing oV doves on record and everybody
cooed In unison.
Last Saturday night Mr. Bowe was not
there *tr. Taylor was also absent, ami
last night they 'let it be known very clear
ly why they were not present. There was
nothing suggestive of the dove about th<=
manner in which Messrs. Mott, Rowe
Mees.=>. Taylor and Stetson expressed
themselves last night. Bach man resented
dictatorship by any other member and
Mr. Rowe turned red, while Mr. Mott
turned white. Everybody realized that it
Was the 1 cginnlng of a new era in the
Council and to-day, although the mem
bers when they meet smile at each other,
being gentlemen, it Is not the same old
emi'.e with which they saluted each other
in the days when the sole energy of th.
legislative department of the city govern
mcnt was being used to force Mayor Snow
to reappoint a police officer or a Street
Superintendent.
"It was no combination, said Mr. <â !
rard to-day: "but. great Caesar! we had
to do something. We weren't elected to

OSCAR LUNING MUST
KEEP HIS AGREEMENT
OAKLAND, Sept. 6.â Judge OKden to
day rendered judgment In favor of the
Stewart Law and Collection Company,
assign of the Tribune Publishing Com
pany, against Oscar Lunlng for the sum
of $- : 'i)o and costs of suit. Mr. Lunlng was
sued on a contract whereby he promised
to pay 1500 toward the souvenir edition of
Ai.:in'ila County, known as the "Alftmeda
County Illustrated,", and published by the
Tribune Publishing Company. Mr. Lun-
Ing contested the claim on the ground j
thai lie agent of the publishers stated
to him that other prominent men were
to subscribe a like amount <>( money. It.
was shown by Attorneys Snook and
Church for the plaintiff that .Mi. Lunlng
mad. his subscription as an enterprising
public citizen for the purpose of advertis
ing the advantages of Alameda County.
It was also agreed by the publishers that
Mr. Luning's ground! and surroundings
were to be written up in the publication.
In deciding the case Judge Off den said
Where it vas down, as it was in this
case, that th<> publishers had gone to a
great expense in getting out this work,
and thai a special consideration, agreed
upon by the parties to the suit, had been
given to Mr. Liming In writing up his
place, that there were no grounds under
the law by which Lunlng could avoid the
contract. The evidence showed that the
work performed for Liming was well
worth the amount of money charged, and
even if it bo considered a case of "vol
untary subscription," that, the work of
getting out the book having been per- 1
formed by the assignor of plaintiff, there
was sufficient consideration to support
the contract made.

BLOODSHED IMMINENT

A Consul's Son Who Is Always "At

ALAMEDA, Sept. 6.â Bloodshed seems
imminent among Alameda High School
students. National pride has reached the
boiling point and naught but a meeting
on the "field of honor" can soothe the
wounded pride of Charles Guislain, son

Young Guislain has thrown down the
gauntlet to Foster Griffiths, who he refers
to as a narrow-minded coward.
The trouble Is all over High School ath
letics. The High School failed to enter
any contestants at the last field day of the
Academic League and tor the failure to
do so and to pay the fine imposed for its
failure has since been suspended from
membership. Grlfliths wrote a letter
which was published in last month's Ala
meda Bee. stating the above facts and
in an indirect manner charged that Guis
lain had offered to enter the field day if
he should be paid $2 50 for it.
The following letter from Guislain ap

THEY NARROWLY
ESCAPED GOING
ON WHALE HEAD
Lurline and Bryant
Just Missed It.
Two vessels have had narrow escapes
from going on Whale Head, near Point
Bonita, within the last forty-eight hours,
The brig Lurline, from Kahului drifted
past the rock on Tuesday afternoon and
was so close that the sailors held their
breath, fearing she would strike. Luckily
the current carried her up toward Arch
Rock and a land breeze soon carried her
out of danger.
The bark C. D. Bryant, from Honolulu,
had her narrow escape yesterday. She
could not clear Whale Head and
Captain Colly had to run her into Paddys
Port and drop his anchor. I*ater the
breeze came along and the Bryant was
worked out of her dangerous predicament
and reached an anchorage off Vallejo
street wharf. In the case of both the
brig and the bark it was a question of the
wind falling light and the tide taking
charge. The Lurline was very light, hav
ing only enough sugar aboard to ballast
her, and had she not fortunately kept in
the current that set toward Arch Rock
she surely would have gone on Whale
Head. The Bryant was loaded, and had a
bceeze such as blew during the afternoon
come up while she was in Paddys Port
.she would have gone ashore.
The captains of the C. D. Bryant and
the German Bark H. Hackfeld had a
peculiar experience. They left Honolulu
within half an hour of each other and
reached San Francisco almost the same
length of time apart. Both vessels made
long voyages of thirty-one days and yet
neither "sighted the other until they were
off port. The schooner Mary K. Foster
made the run up in twenty-three days and
the brig Lurline in nineteen days.
The dozen sailors who deserted the ship
British Isles as soon as she dropped an
chor on Tuesday afternoon are once more
at Sea, and the boarding masters an
richer by nearly $750. When the men were
taken on the P.rltish ship they were prom
ised a good time ashore and then a nice
easy berth on a coaster. Lying In the
stream were the British ship Glenard,
ready to sail for Antwerp; the bark R. i
Rithet, ready to sail for Honolulu, and
the bark Colusa, ready to sail for Kahu
lui. All of these vessels were short of
men and had been held in the stream for
several days in consequence. <>n the
Britisher the captain was willing to pay j
"blood money" and on tiv American ves
sels the captains were willing "to do the
right thing" by the boarding masters, i ul
still men could not be procured because
there were no sailors "on the beach." '
Yesterday the Glenard, Colusa and Rithet
went to sea and not one of the men who
came ashore from the British Isles can ;
be found.
The men are being taken one by one out
of the Dv Guesehlin and Claverdon, which
arrived on Tuesday from Australia and
England, and by Saturday night they also
will be shipped again, minus the money j
they lost by deserting and a month's ad
vance paid by the ship thoy went out on. !
The steamer Del Norte arrived from the
Arctic yesterday with the most valuable ,
r;eneral cargo that has come from the
rozen north this year, it is composed of !
16,812 sealskins. S boxes of walrus ivory, j
S bales of bear skins, 4 musk ox skins. 4
bales of beef hides, 4S bundles whalebone,
and 23 bales pelts, the -whole being valued
at half a million dollars. The sealskins :
come from the Pribilof Islands and nearly >
all the other articles were secured by the
whalers. The musk ox hides are very
rare and very valuable, and come from
the. McKenzie River district. So rare are i
they that people doubt the existence of
thf. musk ox. but the four skins on the
Del N'orte will set their doubts at rest.
Captain Allen of the Del Norte reports
that he saw neither the Homer nor the
Bertha, the two steamers now duo fp.m
St. Michael. At Dutch Harbor the only ;
vessel in port was the steamer Bristol
with a cargo of coal. Four of the sealing
fleet had been driven in by stress of
weather, and reported very rough times '
on Bering Sea and very few seals. At 9t. j
Michael everything was very quiet, but
at Cape Nome things were booming, i
Captain Allen says the diggings are very <
rich and that millions will ba taken out :
of the ground next year. The revenue
cutters Bear, Corwin and Grant were all
spoken by the Del Norte. All were well
aboard.
The steamer Aloha sailed f/>r Cape
Nome yesterday with a few passengi ra i
and a big cargo of general merchandise
She will take on some lumber at Eureka
and s'imo more freight at Seattle and
Will then go to St. Michael and Cape |
Nome. John Heugster, one of the crew,
had the top Of one of his fingers taken .
off while loading the ship. He was treat
ed at ihe harbor hospital by Dr. Robin*
Son and afterward sailed on the vessel.

Andrew Thoresen, a nurse on the hospi- j
tal ship Relief, was very badly beaten on
Howard and Steuart streets early y ester- I
day morning. He had an altercation with '
three men in a restaurant, and they got
him out on the sidewalk and half killed i
him. His hands and face were lacerated !
his leg was broken in two places, and his
ribs on the right side are probably frac
tured. Thoresen was found at 3 a', m. in
an unconscious condition by Officer Clif
ford and taken to the Harbor Hospital,
where Drs. Robinson and Sherwood at
tended to him. He was then removed to !
the hospital ship, and later was sent to j
the Marine Hospital. 1
TEACHERS MAY
GET THEIR FULL
YEAR'S SALARIES
Find a Champion in
Auditor Wells.
So far as Auditor Wells is concerned,
the public school teachers of San Fran
cisco will not be compelled to teach the
young idea how to shoot gratis during any
portion of the present fiscal year, hut
whether the position assumed by the Au
ditor will stand th.' test of the law, or
rather whether the law under the au
thority ot which he is acting will stand
the test of constitutionality, yet remains
to be determined. The law <>n the sub
ject, as it stands, makes it mandatory on
the Auditor to notify the Board of Super
visors, the Board of Education and the
City and County Treasurer, at the begin
ning of each fiscal year, the amount of
money used in the payment of the salaries
of the teachers in the preceding fiscal
year, and to set aside that sum for the
payment of teachers during the passing
year. In this connection the legal
interpretation of the word "used"
will have an important bearing in decid
ing how much the teachers are actually
entitled to, should the constitutionality
of the law be upheld. According to the
Auditors figures, the amount actually
paid the teachers during the last fiscal
year was $60,463 2u. hut that sum, with
the $17:<.:: J| '. 90 withheld because of lack of
funds makes a total <>f $1,029,800 10. If the
word "used" is interpreted to mean the
=urn actually earned by the teachers last
year the amount will be ample to pay all
teachers' salaries f<>r the present fiscal
year, as the estimate of the amount re
quired for that purpose submitted by Su
perintendent Webster is but $i,"'.o.oi'H>. or
nearly $-iÂ»,<ni<i less than the sum to which
tht y Were entitled last year. On the
Other hand, if thr- word "used" is inter
preted to mean che sum actually paid out,
thÂ«> amount the Supervisors will he re
quired to appropriate Is $159,547 less than
the salary estimate. Auditor Wells, how
ever, appears to have taken the more
liberal view of the m< aning of the word,
and unless he is overruled by the law the
teachers will get what may be due them.
In compliance with the law referred to,
the Auditor, after a consultation with
General Dickinson, bis attorney, yesterday
sent the following communication to the
Supervisors and to the County Treasurer:
AUDIT! OFFICE,
PAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 6. 1899.
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors, City
and County of San Francisco:
Gentlemenâ Pursuant to the provisions of
section ISISA. Political Code, I beg leave to
inclose herewith a certified copy of a state
ment made by me showing the sum total of:
school teachers' salaries lor the last fiscal
year, and I beg leave to notify you that I
have and will set the full amount of $1,029.
--800 10 shown by said statement, aside out of
the school fund for this current fiscal year
as a special fund to pay teachers' salaries for
the current fiscal year, as required by said
section. Very truly, ASA R. WELLS.
Auditor.
The statement referred to follows:
AUDIT! OFFICE,
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 6, 1899. â¢
Statement showing amount of money used
in the payment of teachers' salaries in the
public schools of the City and County of San
Francisco for services rendered during the
fiscal year 1898-99:
Amount actually paid out for
said services $550,453 10
Amount of salaries of teachers
for November and December of
said year and remaining unpaid
by reason of litigation concern
ing' same 179,346 90
Sum total J1.029.500 10
The foregoing statement is made In pursu
ance of section ISIBA, Political Code, and is
the amount necessary to pay salaries of teach
ers for the current fiscal year, based upon the
Â»urn total of teachers' salaries for last fiscal
year. ASA R. WELLS,
Auditor City and County of San Francisco.
I hereby certify the foregoing to be a full-,
true and correct copy of the statement made
by me pursuant to the provisions of section
ISIBA, Political Code of California, for the fis
cal year commencing July 1, 1599.
In witness whereof I hereto set my hand,
the 6th day of September. R WELLS.
Auditor City and County of San Francisco.
A copy of the communication will be
sent to the Board of Education this morn
ing
The action of the Auditor practically
makes the teachers preferred creditors or
the department, and in all probability the
matter will ho carried into court on man
damus proceedings, that are almost sure
to he instituted by the merchant creditors
of the department on the ground that the
law quoted by the Auditor is unconstitu
tional in that it is special legislation. The
section of the statutes which bears on the
subjects reads: "Any city or city and
county regarded as one school district,"
and as San Francisco is the only city or
city and county in the State regarded as
"one school district," it alone benefits by
the law. :
City and County Attorney Francis K.
Lane has been requested for an opinion
â 8 to tho legality of the law. and he Is
now engaged in looking up the authori
ties.
A. Chesebrough of the firm of Williams,
Dimond & Co. appeared before the Har
bor Commissioners in regard to wharf
room. A big line of steamers and sailing
vessels is to be put on the run be
tween New York. Honolulu and San
Francisco about July. 1900. and Mr.
Chesehrough wanted to be sure that
there would be plenty of dockage fa
cilities. He was assured by the Com
missioners that ample space would be
provided for the new line. The steamer*
will be put on with the beginning of tw
sugar season next year. m
Qeoige w. Kneaas and John Twigg &
Sons are occupying space in Central Basin
without paying any rent to the commis
sion. Chief Wharfinger Henderson was
Instructed to make a demand upon the
two boat builders for rent, and if they re
fused to pay to eject them at once.
The new collier Matteawan arrived from
New York yesterday. She will have to be,
docked for repairs here, as she was
aground at Satellite Patch, in the Straits
of Magellan, and temporary repairs cost
$10,000. The Matteawan takes the MackN
naw's place, carrying coal for the South
ern Pacific, while the Mackinaw will carry
coal for P. B. Cornwall, and the Progreso
will run to Tacoma for R. D. Chandler,
carrying Roslyn coal.
The steamer Fulton, which was ashore
at Fort Point, is to go on the California
drydoek to-day.

Won't Be a Dandy Any More.
OAKLAND, S<pt. s.â Martin Wyatt is
the most philosophical patient ever treat
ed at the Receiving Hospital. He started
out yesterday to sec a friend off. but as
the "train did not stop at Fruit vale he
jumped off. He has had his right leg
and left foot amputated, and to-day he
sent his fellow-patients into convulsions
by singing "Wasn't I a dandy when 1
started out, but I won't be a dandy any
more."

Ladies in a Runaway.
OAKLAND. S^pt. 6.- Mrs. Archibald
Borland and daughter were driving this
morning, when their horses ho.ted. For
several blocks there was a wild ride, the
animal frequently kicking ovor the dash
board and placing his hoofs within a few
inches of tnÂ« ladlea' heads. Deputy (Un
stable Jack Robinson very cleverly dashed
up alongside the horse to grab the bridle
and finally stopped the animal. The buggy
was badly damaged and the ladies had a
very narrow escape.

HOWARD'S TOOL
HELD TO ANSWER
FOR HIS CRIME
Casey Yet Far From
Liberty.
HIS CONFESSION A SENSATION
POLICE CLOSE ON THE TRAIL OF
HOWARD.
Some of the Incidents That Made
the Double Life of Kelly a
Strange One in This
City.
The confession of John Casey and the
announcement of the arrest of John
Kelly, dangerous members of the How
ard concpiracy, created yesterday a
local sensation. Casey's admission that
he accepted $5000 from Howard as part
compensation to murder "vVillard P.
a showed to what desperate
lengths the gang was ready to go in
crime. Howard and his fellow thieves
would etop at nothing, and the author
ities are being congratulated that they
have destroyed a nest of thieves and
murderous minded men. There is still
a hope that Casey may be landed be
hind prison bars and that he may be
prevented from inflicting injury upon
other communities. While he is the
least clever of the band of thieves he
possesses sufficient ability to make him
dangerous.
lie was held yesterday to answer be
fore the Superior Court by Judge Mo
g.in en the charge of grand larceny by
trick and device In $2000 bonds. His
attorney, George D. Collins, took an
i xreptlon on the ground that the
Judge's decision was based on mere
ecture and asked that It be record
ed, which â was done.
The Judge, after reviewing the cvi
, said It was necessary to con
sider from the circumstances if Casey
had the felonious intent to steal by ;
trick and device, and everything point- i
â¢ 1 to that conclusion. He had ordered i
the clothes under an assumed name
and had sent a messenger for them j
under th>- false pretext that hÂ«> was
sick. He had Btated that he had never
order.-, i any clothes from any tailor in I
this city, whereas it had been shown j
that h-- had done so from Bloch, and
the label on a coat previously ordered
from Bloch and paid for was on it, but j
the labels on the suit In question had
tori . .- lied w hen he told
tives Gibson and Kills that he had
bought any clothes in this city,
uap satisfied that h>
had shown felonious Intent to obtain !
esorting to trh-k and de
vice.
The appeals for :i writ of habeas cor
pus taken by Casey before Superior
c Murasky will be determined to
day. In 'ne of the appeals the thief
M'ls that tlif court has no juris- '
n. This contention is purely a
and is frequently made
ire as a matter of
â¢ â  â  lief. Th"
second appeal insists that the case In
a criminal one and
should be decided therel ire by a < ivll
r Judge Murasky will
points to
day.
Unless there be a mosi unexpected
â¢ of justice James Kelly will re
main in a Mexican prison for some
Th.' (;. - â¢ him is cl< ar
and Chief of I*â >li< â¢â¢ Lees will send to
the Mexican polio* officials a history of
â¢ â¢ Important facts of the
criminal's life. While in this city
Kelly led a remarkable double life.
After his arrival in the city he made
â¢ effort i â¢ locate himself, wife and
child in a respectable neighborhood re
â¢ d from the centers of traffic. He

propriety In his home and the Stivers
had absolutely no reason to complain
of his demeanor. His business was
transacted elsewhere.
In the downtown district, however,
Kelly was a different character. After
some stroke of fortune, as the theft of
the sack of coin in front of the t/T
--press office, he spent his money reck- j
lessly and with the liberality born of I
drunkenness. He was a welcome guest
at evil resorts and the saloon men
looked upon him as a benefactor. Then
his extravagance would pause until an
other raid and so he continued to the
end.
It is with Howard that Chief of Po
lice Lees has yet to deal. Casey's and
Kelly's power for harm has been de
stroyed. Howard is still at liberty,
amply provided with money and able
to adapt himself to any circumstances.
The police claim that while they have
not caught up with him they have not
been very far behind him and they
have every reason to believe that they
will soon capture him. The confession
of Casey of the diabolic plot to murder
Green, in connection with other evi
dence In the possesion of the authori
ties, will make the outcome very dis
agreeable to Howard if ever he is
caught. When the capture is made the
police will reveal their discoveries.

more addresses upon American and par
ticularly Pacific Interests in the Far Kast.
Mr. Harrett is a native of Vermont, antl
while at Dartmouth College, he wrote a
number of articles which were published
In tho magazines and newspapers of
the United States. One of his choice sub
jects was "The New South."
Soon after graduating ho came to this
city and lived here and in Oakland a
while in IKM. In 1894 he was appointed
by President Cleveland as Minister to
Slam, being then the youngest Minister
of the country. While abroad the new
Minister made a number of visits to
China, Korea, Indio-China, the Straits
(Settlements, Java and the Philippines.
During that time he has made a special
Ftudy of trade and commercial condi
tions and possibilities of the countries of
the Far East. When it was known that he
was to return to the United States, the
local Chamber of Commerce made an
effort to have him come home by the way
of San Francisco, but the pressure of
Eastern, and, In fact, European, commer
cial bodies to have him address 'them
caused him to visit the Continent and his
native State before coming here. Last
June the Chamber of Commerce sent to
Mr. Barrett an invitation to visit this city
to address the commercial bodies and
the public upon his observations relating
to commercial affairs in the Orient. After
some correspondence he wrote Secretary
Scott from New York under the date of
August 27 in the following vein:
I beg to inform you, in accordance witl\ the
kind suggestions of your previous letters, that
I shall arrive in San Francisco on or about
the 19th of September, but not later, and shall
remain there for the next seven days. What
ever date in that time you may decide upon
for me to comply with your invitation to speak
â will be satisfactory to me. May I suggest that
you ask other commercial bodies, like the Mer
chants' Association and Wholesalers' Associa
tion, to Join with you on this occasion? It is
my purpose In my address at San Francisco to
treat of this question of our commercial oppor
tunities In the Pacific and Far East in the
most exact manner that I have yet taken It
up, and should I>e mucn honored to have as
large and Influential a hearing as possible â
like those kindly accorded me In the East.
You probably know that I am particularly In
terested in San Francisco's taking advantage
of the great opportunity before her, and 1
shall make special reference from that stand
point. â¢ Â« .
The officers of the chamber will at once
send to Portland. Or., where Mr. Barrett
will be between the Sth and 17th, to learn
what dates can be announced for his ad
dresses here, as they will certainly have
as large an audience to listen to the gen-
I tleman as possible. Every commercial
and industrial body and the general pub
lic will be requested to be in attendance
I to give the ex-Minister a fitting re
i ception. His addresses in the East
and London attracted widespread atten
j tion. Mr. Barrett's views upon the mi
i fluences to advance between this coast
â  and the Oriental countries are summed
up in the following language:
First â The Nicaragua canal should be built
without further delay. Second â A cable should
be laid across the Pacific, touching at Hawaii
and the Philippines, as well as having branches
In China, Japan and Australia. Thirdâ
larger and faster steamers should be, placed on
the Pacific, ami reasonable subsidies for carry-
Ing the mails should be given to the lines
making the best time and providing the best
ships. Fourthâ American banks. . or connec
tions, of great American banks, should be Im
mediately established in such representative
places as Yokohama. Shanghai. Hongkong and
Manila. Fifthâ At some central point, like
Shanghai, a permanent first-class exhibit of
American products; should be maintained.
Sixthâ Business firms in America wishing to do
business In the Far East should srnd thor
oughly competent and capable men to represent
them In the Orient, and nut trust to second
rate men and catalogues. Seventhâ Our diplo
matic and consular service, as far as possible,
should be placed under the" civil service, and
comir.ereinl attaches should be appointed to our
leading legations or consulates. Eighth â
Branch a of the American Asiatic Association,
which Is doing such good work here and In
Shanghai, should bo organized In all other
Asiatic cities. Ninthâ And: finally, our manu
facturers and exporters should find out just
what the Orient wants, and make it. and not
expect the Orient to take what we make but
what they do not want.
All of these points and suggestions and
many others will be enlarged upon by the
brilliant speaker and diplomat from the
Far East when he .sneaks here.

THE LAW CONSTITUTIONAL
OPINION BY JUDGE MORROW
SUPPORTING LABOR.
Judgment Given Against the Garneti
Gold Mining Company for the
"Wages of Its Employes
With Costs.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday morning handed down an opin
ion that will be read with interest and
received with joy by every wageworker
in this State. The opinion affirms the
constitutionality of the State statute re
quiring corporations to pay their crn
; ployes as often as once every month at
least.
The opinion is in the case of Henry
' Skinner vs. Garnett Gold Mining Com
pany, a West Virginia corporation en
gaged In mining in Sierra County. The
action was brought to recover $3981 50
With legal interest from December 14, 1897,
costs of suit and an attorney's fee of
$500, and that the whole be adjudged a
first lien upon the property of the de
fendants, said principal amount being due
to the plaintiff and his assignors as
i miners' wages.
The defendant alleges that Skinner and
his assignors were employed under an
agreement to take their pay from the
r proceeds of the defendant's mine, which
: was being worked by them; that they
wouW not expect that their wages would
be paid monthly or regularly at all, and
that they would not expect any pay for
! their work until February. 1898. The de
; fendant also contends that the statute
requiring monthly payments, etc.. is un
! constitutional (statutes of California,
page 231). The defendant contends also
that since the provisions of sections 2
and 6 are not specifically referred to in
its title these two sections are unconsti
: tutional.
i Judge Morrow's opinion holds that their
unconstltutionallty, If established, would
not invalidate the entire act, but merely
! the sections involved. Article IV, section
24. Â«pi the Constitution of California also
provides: "But if any subject shall be
i embraced In an act which shall not be
expressed in its title, such act shall be
void only as to bo much thereof as shall
not be expressed in the title." The Su
, preme Court said: "In Abeel vs. Clark,
84th California, 229, we held that it was
not necessary thai the title of the act
should embrace an abstract of its con
tents. â¢ * * The object was to prevent
deception by the inclusion of matters In
congruous with the subject specified in
the title."
Defendant contends further that the
statute discriminates unreasonably
against corporations, and destroys the
liberty and property of private contracts
in several of its provisions. This con
tention cannot be sustained, says Judge
Morrow, and there Is no discrimination
Involving the breach of any of the con-
Btitutional enactments Invoked by the
defendant The provisions that corpora
tions shall have a regular monthly pay
day and thai the employes of a corpora
tion shall In the event of a violation of
tin provisions of section l by the corpor
i ation be entitled to a lien on the n r Â°P
erty of the corporation, taking precedence
of all other liene except recorded nmrt
gagi - and deeds of trust, to a reasonable
attorney's fee If he is obliged to bring
an action at law to recover his wages,
and to an attachment against the prop
erty of the corporation, and that an un
recorded deed shall not be a defense to
such an action arc noi such as unjustly
discriminate against the defendant. * *
â¢ The promise to pay wages after an in
terval of six months cannot be called gond
consideration for the alleged agre< ment.
Judgment is given for the sum claimed
and for an attorney's fee of $300.
NATIVES AND CITIZENS'
COMMITTEE AT PEACE
BILLS FOR THE NIGHT PARADE
ARE APPROVED.
Employment Bureau Working Earn-
estly to Secure Situations for
the California Volunteers.
The citizens' executive committee and
the Native Scins have reached an under
standing an tn tlie bills incurred by the
latter in connection with the night pa
rade. Marshal Pistolesl appeared before
the committee yesterday morning and ex
plained the disputed claims to the satis
faction of every member cind all pros
pects of trouble were swept away by a
motion duly made, seconded and unani
mously carried to allow the amounts.
Many bills are yet to be passed upon
by the committee and until all claims are
adjusted, no financial statement will be
given to the public.
A band concert will be given this after
noon at Union square under the auspices
of the citizens' committee. The object la
to attract the soldiers and sailors to the
placo and acquaint them with the fact
that the tent has been provided for their
us* 1 and benefit.
Thf committee also decided to give a
theater party next Monday night to the
oflicers of the Wyoming, Idaho, North
Dakota and ( Colorado regiments.
The volunteer employment committee
held a meeting yesterday afternoon in
the tent at Union square. It was an
nounced that the committee was making
much progress. Communications from out
of town, as well as local business houses,
signify the intention of managers to give
the preference to soldiers In matters of
employment.
The following circular letter is being
sent to firms who formerly had In their
employ men who joined the California
regiment:
On looking- over the muster roll of the First
Regiment, CaJifornia Volunteers, we see the
narre of who. according to the di
re'tory of ISSS, was In your employ previous to
Koing to Manila. Will you please let us know
by return mall If Mr will be rein
stated In his old or some equally good position
as soon as his service in the army Is at an end?
These boys will be mustered out on the 21st
of this month, and It Is the earnest desire of
this committee to see that places are found for
all at the earliest date possible. Your assist
ance In placing your old employes, and as
many others as you possibly can, in permanent
profitable positions will be ffreatly appreciated,
not only by this committee but by every sol
dier's friend In the State of California.
The committee decided to forward a
letter to each of the Pacific Coast mer
chants who are now visiting in San
Francisco requesting them to do what
they can in securing employment for the
volunteers. About 2000 business men from
interior towns will receive these commu
nications and the committee expects to
.â lecompllsh some good through their
efforts.
The twenty-five scholarships for Healds'
Business College, which have been offered
to disabled volunteers, was the subject
of a lengthy discussion. It was finally
decided to -request the attendance of
Colonel Duboce at the next meeting of
the committee and secure his advice as
to their disposition. Colonel Duboce was
also voted a member of the committee.

CHINESE ACTORS ARRIVE.
Two Hundred and Fifty Mongols to
Be Landed for the Philadel
phia Exposition.
Two hundred and fifty of the eontin-
R-pnt of 450 Chinese actors, exhibitors,
acrobats and villrtpr builders have arrived
,-it this port and will be landed by Port
Collector Jackson pursuant to the pro
visions of the resolution i>nssfHl at the
last pÂ»ssion of Congress to admit them
for the purposes of the Philadelphia ex
position The certificates have arrived
from Washington and the Collector will
til! them as soon as the Chinese shall have
furnished their photographs to be pasted
upon the certificates. The owners of the
concession will furnish bonds to the Secre
tary of the Treasury puarant^eingr that
the <'liin.se will return to China within
three months after the close of the expo
sition.
The "safeguards" art* simi'mr to those
observed in the case of the Chinese who
came hither to attend the Omaha Expo
sition last year. In that ease the bond was
kMven by the Mcc l*ee Company and the
company failed, so that the bond rould
not lie collected. The Chinese scattered
themselves all over the country and
nearly all remained in this country, a
hirtre* numberâ about 2iX> womenâ being
slaves destined for a life of vice in San
Francisco and other seaport cities. It is
expected that the Philadelphia Exposi
tion will be a repetition of the Omaha
affair s<> far as tho Chinese contingent is
concerned.
