INTERNATIONAL YACHT RACE TO BE
REPORTED BY WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
NEWS WILL BE GIVEN WHILE
THE RACE IS BEING SAILED
Details of the Great Contest Will Be Flashed Through Space While the Rival English
and American Craft Are Striving for Supremacy.
NEW YORK, Aug. 2p.===Encouraged by The Call's great success in reporting the Sherman's arrival by wireless teleg.
raphy arrangements have been made by The Call and the Herald with those in charge of the ocean steamer Grande
Duchesse of the Plant line to report from its decks by wireless telegraphy the international races between the yachts
Columbia and Shamrock. Experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this work, and the facilities offered by the
commodious steamer to successfully carry it out are excellent.
This is an event which attracts wide attention, not alone because it will be the means of obtaining earliest reports
of the results of the cup races, but because it will be the first attempt to use the Marconi system in obtaining a report of
a great event. The Grande Duchesse will be present at all the international races, and, in consequence of the important
part she will take in the matter of their being quickly and accurately reported, will be conspicuous in the large accom
panying fleet.
So many successful experimeots have recently been made abroad and in this couQtry by the Marconi systerr),
which is to be used in reporting the yacl^t races, that the purpose of Tl}e Call and t\)e Herald will be appreciated
throughout the world. â  . â¢ â 
Not only will the result of th)e yacht race be transmitted from the dec^s of the Grande Duchesse, but every
ir)cider)t of t^e races will be quickly dispatched by wireless telegraph aod forwarded to The Call over a special wire.

RENO. Aug 29.â Wm. J. Bryan and
wife passed through this city on to
night's overland bound for the coast.
Quite a number of persons gathered at
the depot, and on the arrival of the
train demanded a speech.
Mr. Bryan, standing on the platform
â of his sleeper, gave a twenty-minute
speech, in which he ran through the
questions of free silver, anti-expansion,
anti-trusts, anti-McKinley and anti
pretty much the whole gamut. Mr.
Bryan's talk was frequently applauded
and the train pulled out amid rousing
cheers for "William J. Bryan, our next
President."
â¢Mr. Bryan did not speak loud enough
for many to hear, apparently saving his
voice for more important occasions.
His next steep will be in Sacramento.
where he will be met by representatives
of the Democratic State Central Com
mittee. He will probably arrive in San
Francisco to-morrow night.

WINNEMUCCA. Nev., Aug. 29.â Hon.
William Jennings Bryan passed through
Winnemucca this afternon on his way to
California, where he will visit the Yo
semite. He will remain a week in the
valley.
Mr. Bryan was met at Calconda, fifteen
miles east of here by Hon. George S.
Nixon. At Winnemucca the train stopped
to enable Mr. Bryan to deliver an address
to the large crowd that had gathered.
Mr. Bryan spoke strongly, condemning
the policy of expansion els proposed by
the present administration. In part Mr.
Bryan said: -
I believe the outlook for success in 1900 never
looked better than at present. On the old
questions of the campaign of W)6 we are
stronger than we were during thai campaign.
On the new questions we are gaining steadily.
The Chicago platform at the convention next
year will be reaffirmed entirely. In fact I
doubt whether an) opposition to the platform
will manifest itself In the convention at all.

PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 29.â The
battleship Alabama, which re-
turned this evening from her
builder's trial trip, made a record
to-day as the fastest battleship
in the American navy, having attained
a speed of 17.23 knots. She ran down
to the capes from Cramp's "ship yard
under natural draught In about seven
hours and there anchored for the night.
Early this morning she passed be
yond the capes and circled around for \
a long time while observations were be- j
ing made of the sun for the correction !
of the compass. The sky was clouded, !
but the sun appeared reasonably j
bright. At 8:45 the vessel started from |
the Overfalls Lightship to the South- !
west Lightship, off Five Fathoms Bay,
which was reached at 10:20 a. m. From j
that time until 3 o'clock runs were
made between the Southwest and
Northeast lightships. Two complete j

rounds were made. On the first 103^
revolutions per minute were attained,
when an average speed of 15.25 knots
were made. , riy
It was not time to make the runs un
der forced draught. Down in the en
gine room the oilers went over the ma
chinery by giving various parts
baths of Oil. The' stokers who
were keeping steam up during
the first run were replaced by
fresh men and while waiting for steam
to be got up to high pressure, the bat
tleship described a number of circles
and showed herself a very easy ship to
handle, her turning circle being re
markably small for a vessel of her class
and displacement.
After about half an hour of prelimin
ary jockeying around the post for all
the world reminding one of the prelim
inaries to a horse race. Chief Engineer
Tone finally sent word up that he was
ready for the trial. Pointing her big
buff nose into the teeth of the wind
again, the Alabama passed the light
with a rush, carrying a tremendous
bone in her teeth. As in the previous
course, her steadiness was remarkable
and showed beyond doubt that she af
forded a good gun platform.
On she rushed, the propellers beating
a devil's tattoo in the green waterwhlch
was hurled back at the stern as though
shot out of a gigantic gun. Her for
ward deck was continually wetted by
water which curled up over her bow,
but there was an almost total absence
of the pitch which one might have ex
pected under prevailing weather con
ditions. -2px-':x
On the second round full force
draught was Used, the revolutions
being run up to 114^. On the
fourth leg her speed was run up to 17.25
knots and an average for the round
was 16.37. knots. . On the return to the
Overfalls Lightship the revolutions
were purposely limited to 85 per min
ute. 'XZyZx
A strong northeast wind was blowing,
averaging thirty miles an hour and
when the ship was facing it waves
broke high over the boat, spray dash-
ing across the bridge forty feet above
the water. The vessel, too, was light,
not being full armored and drawing
only twenty feet of water instead of
twenty-three feet six inches. She be
haved admirably, however, and delight
ed not only Edwin S. Cramps, but the
United States naval representatives
who were on board.
Several Russian oflicers were inter
ested spectators and were much pleased
with the performance of the ship. The
boilers steamed freely and the engines
developed only a few minor faults. Mr.
Cramp says that there is no doubt the
Alabama will make 17 knots on her
official trial trip. The contract calls
for 16 knots and there is no premium
for an excess. The Alabama will prob
ably be taken to Philadelphia before
noon to-morrow. *

J. F. TURNER SHOT
DEAD BY A VICTIM
Famous Swindler Drops by the Pistol of a
Man He Dupedâ A Life Replete With
Fraudulent Practices and a Record
Unequaled as a Confidence Man.
â¢tj' F. TUHNfiM is dead; he will
swindle no more. After run-
Uning a course of forty-eight
years, twenty of which were
employed in wrecking the
happiness of others, he met his death
yesterday ' morning at the hands of
Joseph P. Frenna, a barber on Polk
street, near Sutter, who has suffered
from the evil and crafty designs of a
swindler, the subtlest and shrewdest
that ever operated nefarious business
schemes in San Francisco.
Turner was shot doWn in the Crocker
building shortly after 8:30 o'clock yes
terday morning. . An hour after the
news ran a riotous course down Mont-
gomery and up Market street and there
was not a man who knew him that had
one single word of good to say. The
"nothing but good of the dead" was
ignored in the reminiscences of a life
that disclosed a history tinctured with
fraud and redolent with shady, criminal
transactions. â 
Turner did not practice upon the
credulity of the foolhardy or the inex
perienced. ; His game was the men who
j had money, who knew of the world's
CALLS SUCCESS AROUSES
INTEREST IN THE EAST
ways and who were ready to risk a lit
tle to gain much or a great deal to gain
more. There are names on his books
that would startle the modern money
lender into a waking nightmare at the
bare thought of the possibility of a
fraud being practiced upon them. In
so much was this man great for he out
witted some of the shrewdest, keenest
and cloverest brokers that ever plied
their vocations in this city.
The man who cut short Turner's ill
savored career is now in the City
Prison, booked on a charge of murder.
He was apprehended soon after the
deed was done and was immediately
put under arrest. His flrst day in jail
was perhaps the most unique of any
prisoner charged with the most awful
of crimes. Men who had never heard
the name of Frenna, but who had met
Turner some time in their business ca
reers called and with outstretched
hands offered the barber any assistance
he might ask of them. Lawyers, mer
chants and friends alike went through
the discomfiture of a visit to the City
Prison to let Frenna know that they
sympathized with him and would do all
in their power tO alleviate his present
unfortunate position.
The murder was not seen by a single
eye-witness, although as soon as it
was consummated a group gathered
about the murderer and the dead man:
Frenna claims that he shot Turner to
death in self-defense, fearing that un
less he acted quickly his own life would
be put in jeopardy. The shooting oc
curred on the third floor of.the Crock
er building in the corridor directly in
front of the elevator. Turner had just
left the office of his attorney, George
D. Collins, and was waiting for the
down elevator. Frenna was on his
way to the office of Charles E. Greg
ory, a short distance down the corri
dor.
.According to the story of the bar
ber, as he was about to pass Turner
the latter reached for his hip pocket,
and, thinking that he intended to draw
a pistol, Frenna whipped his own gun
out of his pocket and began firing its
contents into the body of the arch
swindler. Five shots were heard in
rapid succession. In fact each report
was so hard upon its predecessor that
it sounded like the rattle of musketry
PRICE FIVE CEXTS.
fire. Four shots took effect, two of
which were lodged in the back of the .
dead man after having passed through
the heart and liver. One shot grazed
the right shoulder, and another went
through the second finger of the right
hand, boring a hole in the palm and
lodging in the wrist. Frenna's work
was certainly well done, for Turner
fell face downward, a bunch of deeds
which he held in his hand dropping be-
side him as an index of his life acts
which brought him to such an un-
timely end. The documents were in a
circular cardboard frame, and this as
well as the papers was perforated by
the bullet shot.
Almarin B. Paul, a mining engineer in
the same office with Charles E. Greg
ory, was in a room on one of the cor-
ridors leading off the main vestibular
hall-way. After the five shots were
fired he rushed out and approached
Frenna, who was standing some little
distance from the supine body of the
i murdered man. "Who did this?" asked
j Paul of Frenna, as the people from all
I directions .began tearing through the
1 hall-ways to the scene of the murder.
"I did it, but in self defense." was the
ready answer of Frenna. Paul then told
him to come into his room, which the
barber did, without resistance. The
door was locked behind them and Paul
advised the slayer of Turner to deliver
himself to the police as soon as they
arrived. Frenna agreed to do so and as
soon as Officers Tracy and Ross ap
peared they found their man awaiting
them. The body of Turner was re-
moved to the morgue, where an autopsy
was held by Drs. Zabala and Long.
! after which it was taken to the parlors

j pany, where the inquest will be held to

which he had forged the name of the
Recorder. Turner was convicted on
the charge of forgery and* sentence i to
ten years' imprisonment at Folsom. An
appeal was taken to the Supreme Court
and the cause remanded upon a tech
nicality. The word "willfully" had not
been inserted in the original complaint,
and the wise men of the law gave Tur
ner his freedom. The grand larceny
charge and trial came to naught, as the
jury disagreed, and the- case was af
terward dismissed on motion of the
District Attorney. In 1897 Turner was
again Indicted, this time on charges of
perjury alleged to have been com
mitted in the previous- trials. Nothing
tame of this, however, and he was in
dicted again with the same good for
tune in seeing the charges fall to the
ground. The third indictment brought
more than the law's delays. Turner was
convicted in Judge Carroll Cook's
court, but the Supreme Court came to
his relief and lv- was released on an-_
other technicality. This man not only
outwitted his fellow-creatures, but a
streak of luck put him above the reach
of justice. â¢
About four years ago Fr.enna and
Turner indulged in an interchange of
deeds for the settlement of some busi
ness operation. The deed which Fren
na gave to Turner was for a piece of
land in Santa Clara County. This was
not recorded at the time. Two weeks
ago Frenna engaged in a business deal
with another party for the sale of sev
eral hundred acres of fruit land in
Sonoma County. He employed C. E.
Gregory to have a transcript of the
title made, when he discovered that
the land was deeded away in the
original indenture given to Turner four
years before at the sale of the Santa
Clara property. Frenna claims that
Turner inserted the description of the
Sonoma property very recently in or
der to prevent the sale and to fraudu
lently acquire the land for himself. In
other words, Frenna charges a for
gery similar to the one for which Tur
ner was indicted in 1 *-'.'â "..
When these facts were discovered by
the barber he fairly burst with passion,
though no one has ever heard him utter
any direct threats against Turner. In
fact, according to statements of friends,
Frenna feared a quarrel with the man
he has murdered and avoided him.
A year ago Turner brought charges
gainst his murderer in the poMce
courts on the ground of threats
against life, but Frenna was dismissed
on the promise of peaceful conduct.
"Whether the murder yesterday was
provoked by the misdeeds of the dead
man or was really in imagined self
defense may never be known.
On the body- of the dead man were
found enough papers, documents and
wallets to fill a large-sized office desk:
It may truly be said of J. F. Turner
that "he carried his office in his hat."
Deeds, notes, checks, memoranda, a
plethora of names and letters were
stowed away in the capacious pockets
of his coats and always at hand for
his immediate use. Some of these docu
ments throw light on his business
methods and his fraudulent practices,
but the bulk of his past transactions
have no record left but a memory in
that "the country is within sight of
war which may shortly be as unavoid
able as, on the merits of the question,
it would be inexcusable."
To whatever d'apateh or conditions
President Kruger's defiant remark re
ferred, it has brought home sharply
the keen possibility of an impending
war against no weak-kneed adversary.
It is said that with recruits from over
the borders, the Transvaal would have
about 60,000 men at its disposal.
whereas, the most the British could
now throw on the frontier would be
30,000, though of course this number
would be materially increased within a

It seemed that the dead man was ad
dicted to the use of opium. In his
pocket was found a package of yen-she.
Frenna, who claims to know of Turner's
habit, stated last night that the latter
was an opium-smoker during all the
time he knew him. It is said that while
he was in prison on the various charges
brought against him at one time and
another he had bribed all the jailers
to smuggle in the Lethean weed.
Turner's ability first demonstrated it
self In the case of "Nobby" Clarke from
whom he received notes aggregating to
$365,000 and which he was to dispose of
for Clarke on a discount. These notes
caused much trouble, particularly of
the financial sort, when people did dis
count them. Monty A. -Rose was
caught for many thousand dollars on
the deal, as were many others. It
would be almost impossible to get a full
list of the duped, but here are some of
the supposed victims: Henry Oterson,

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 30, 1599.
Boers appear to be quietly concentrat
ing in the western part of the Trans
vaal. A Boer spy has been arrested in
Ramattabama Camp, in British Bechu
analand.
The Johannesburg correspondent of
the Morning Post says: President
Kruger, in the course of an interview
to-day (Tuesday) regarding the crisis,
said he considered the Boer position
best defined by Psalm 83.
The -Pretoria correspondent of the
Daily Chronicle, telegraphing Tues
day, says: Events have taken an
contention, always walking out of court
with a smile and without even a line.
When seen yesterday all Frenna had
to say was: "I killed the man in self
defense. I feared for my life and I
shot him for that reason." Frenna ad
| mitted that Turner had a small package
' in his hand, but be said he was afraid
| to take a chance with Turner and that
is why he fired when the latter reached
for his hip pocket.
In the afternoon Frenna, accompanied
by two officers, was allowed to visit
his wife, who is ill since Monday, when
i a little girl was born to them. The
I wife had heard of the affair and Frenna
| was permitted to visit her.
DEFENDS HER HUSBAND.
Mrs. Turner Says Frenna Was
the Tool of Conspirators.
During the long hours last night Mrs.
Turner, surrounded by her friends, sat
by the body of hec husband and between
her sobs spoke in defense of the dead.
Many who have remained loyal to her
husband through his many trials, and
who ever refused to believe that he was
other than the victim of a conspiracy
against ids honor and against his life,
were there to comfort her as best they
could and to care for her daughters, for
whom it seems the sun of happiness has
forever set.
"An assassin, the tool of shrewder con-
spirators, has forever closed my hus-
band's lips," said Mrs. Turner, "but, with
the closing of his, mine have been opened,
and before the end of it all I will tell
the world my story, and then it will be-
lieve with me that my dead husband was
not the vicious character that his ene
mies painted him. There was but one
motive for this awful crime. After years
of battle he had finally bested his- ene
mies, and the time had come for him to
turn the tide and bring them to trial for
the many crimes they committed against
him. In a few days Frenna was to have
been arrested by my husband. This he
knew and was fearful of the conse
quences. He has gone to my husband's
lawyers and to his friends and begged
them to intercede in his behalf and let
him keep his liberty. Knowing that mv
husband would never forgive them for
.the many wrongs they have done him
Frenna was so advised, and he was in
despair. Still I do not believe that in his
own mind he felt very bitter toward my
husband. It was Lawrence S. Meggin-
son, who, after he had been befriended.
turned traitor and formed the conspiracy
against -my husband that kept the feel
ing of bitterness ever burning within
Frenna, and it is indirectly, through his
influence on Frenna, who readily, sue-.
cumbed to his smooth tongue, that my
husband now lies dead, the victim ot a
murderer's bullet.
"It Is said that Frenna will try to jus
tify his act by a claim of self-defense
and will also contend that he was swin
dled out of vast sums of money. To re-
fute the former claim, he could not have
acted in self-defense, as my husband had
no weapon upon him with which to attack
his murderer, and, again, the bullets that
caused mv poor husband's death came
from behind. For "months my husband
had been In fear of his life at the hands
of Frenna. Not long ago he thought of
arming himself to guard against a possi
ble attack, but 1 coaxed him not to carry
a weapon. Then I understood that he
went to Chief Lees and had Frenna put
under bonds to keep the peace. After this
1 rested more contented, but lately again
I heard Frenna had said that 'either Mrs.
Turner or Mrs. Frenna would wear black
in the near future.' Mr. Turner was
afraid, but I told him that I did not be.
lieve that Frenna had the courage to
shoot him. He said that he did not fear
Frenna on the street, but believed that
he was an assassin and would lie in wait
for him, â¢ perhaps behind our steps, and
shoot him in the back. For this reason
for the past week some one has com*
alarming turn. Great Britain, at the
request of the Ultlanders' Council, has
enlarged the original demands of Sir
Alfred Milner, the British High Com
missioner, and is adopting the view of
Cecil Rhodes that President Kruger
will never withstand an ultimatum.
I have, however, high authority for
asserting that President Kruger, " the
Volksraad and the nation will un
itedly resist an unconditional de
mand for giving effect to the Milner
programme, but will concede reforms on
the conditions already reported.
home with my husband every night, and
Frenna, perhaps knowing this, waited un
til he caught him alone and then com
mitted the murder. As to the second
charge that my husband had swindled
him out of considerable money, it is also
false. My husband was ready to pay him
if ho owed him anything, and it was but
a short time ago when I understood that
Frenna was told to leave his account with
a well-known money-lender and It wouid
be paid If found due. He went away mut
tering, and the account never came. He
was the tool of a band of conspirators.
and just now as Mr. Turner was ready to
turn on them they did not want money
but his life, and they have taken it."
After Mrs. Turner had spoken one of
her friends spoke up and said that
Frenna's claim that ho wont into the
Crocker building on business was false.
He said that Frenna had been seen to
leave a doorway and follow Turner along
Pine and Montgomery streets after that
dead man bad left the offlces of D. E.
Beseclfer, 306 Pine, street, and continued on
his way to the Crocker building. He said
that Frenna followed Turner into tho
building and â¢followed him to the third
floor, and then, when the opportunity of
fered, shot him in the hack. D. E. Be
secker corroborates the story in a meas
ure, stating that Turner was at his* oiuce
just a short time before he met his death.
As to his being followed after leaving
there he cannot Bay. In any event Turner
was shot, the friends say. without an
opportunity for defense, and the motive
was to close his lip-***, but they say ihat
the fight against them will be taken up
where it was dropped by the dead man
and prosecuted, to the end. and they have
gained but little by adding murder to
their list of crimes.

WASHINGTON, Aug. That the

Orleans, and United States Consul j
Simpson, at Puerto Plata. On account â 
of the interruption in the cable corn

j compelled to send his message by boat j
' to Santiago de Cuba, from which iroint '
'' it was cabled to Washington. It is.
; therefore, two days old. He stated that
I the recognized government had sent
commissioners to confer with the rev-
olutionists for purposes of bringing
about peace and that the entire trouble
was due to the condition of the cur
i rency of the island. He further stated
I that a French man-of-war was lying

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 29.-Offlclals at Ag
| news Asylum deny that there was any
irregularity or neglect in the case of
Waiter Root of Woodland, who died at
i that institution on Friday. Instead they
â  readily explain matters and refer to Dr.
J. F. Dillon of San Francisco, who was
| present and saw. the remains shipped. Ha
! knew the particulars or the Injured arm.
Dr. Sponogle was in San Francisco to
i day, and in his absence First Assistant
j Physician Stocking talked readily of the
case.
Root came to the hospital on December i
i 28, 1898, suffering with general paresis,
, from which his death resulted. He was in !
I fair physical condition, but declined rap- i
â  idly. He had to be watched constantly.
i He had a propensity to pick his face and
hands and heat his bead against the â¢
1 walls. These acts had to be guarded
against all the time. Root bent his el
bows and feet against the floors and j
I walls. The injury to the elbow was in
duced by knocks till a sore and disease
jof the bone resulted. At times it was '
! greatly inflamed. '
I A few days previous to his death when :
! dressing Root threw himself forward, ;
causing the injury t.i the tissues of his '
diseased arm. The arm was carefully
dressed with proper medical applications
and splints. After his death these were !
; removed and clean bandages put around
the elbow.
Root's relatives had never been assured
that he was getting better. Up to the day
i before he died there was no indication
' that death would result Immediately, al-
I though it was expected. -He became un
'. conscious then and went into spasms, and
continued in them for many hours. This
i probably accounted for the contortion of
! the face. -
Dr. Stocking did not know anything
! about the fracture of the ribs, but said
i Root might have been so injured in
thrashing around. Root did not know he
i suffered and was unable to make com
i plaint.
Dr. Stocking said the remains were
: carefully washed and dressed for ship
-1 ment. Dr. Dillon of San Francisco a
! brother-in-law of the deceased, was pres
ent arranging for the shipment. Dillon
: was told of the fractured arm and he
; seemed satisfied. The body was dressed
lin a shroud. The mouth and eyes were
closed and everything was properly ar
ranged. The body was taken to Santa
Clara, thence to San Jose, and shipped to
Woodland. If It was not properly ar
ranged when it arrived at its destination
I it was because of the rough handling tt
| received on the way.

Special Dispatcli to The Call.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. John Lopes, a
San Clemente dairyman, was bitten by a
pet cat about two weeks ago and is now
suffering from hydrophobia in its most
virulent form. The Interest taken in the
case by the medical fraternity on ac
count of its rarity is increased by the
complications resulting from an accident.
Lopes, having symptoms of tetanus, or
lockjaw, Dr. W. J. Wickman, the attend-
ing physician, pronounces the case the
most peculiar ever drawn to his atten
'tlon. . .'.â "-,.â "â¢
Two weeks ago Lopes was bitten in the
right thumb by a cat. The next day he
ran a sliver under the thumb nail. The
thumb began to swell and Lopes went to
San Francisco for medical treatment. A
few days ago Dr. Wickman was sum-
moned to San Clemente and found Lopes
suffering from hydrophobia. He frothed
at the mouth and struggled desperately
to bite the physician, but was restrained
by two muscular attendants. He was
both feverish and delirious, and prior to
Wiekman's arrival had been, in convul
sions, in addition the patient swallowed
with difficulty and had other symptoms of
tetanus.
Dr. Wickman lanced the thumb to re
lease the pus and gave other medical
treatment. Lopes was then sent to St.
Mary's Hospital in San Francisco, where
a large number of physicians have called
to make a study of the patient's condi
tion. : :-.
"The man plainly had hydrophobia
from the cat bite,-' said Dr. Wickman.
"and vet indications of tetanus from the
sliver wound were present. Strange as
such a complication may appear, I have
just received word that the physicians at
St. Mary's have confirmed my opinion.
The case is one of the most peculiar in
the annals of medicine, and cannot fail
I to excite widespread interest."

a trifle lighter than his opponent.
Choynskl 'a superiority as a boxer was
evident from the first, though the punish

not all 'on one side, though Choynski

At the end of the tenth round Ryan's
nose was bleeding freely from the effects
of Joe's left jabs. Choynski's left seemed
to be always ready to meet Ryan's ducks.

gamely, landing repeatedly, but with little
effect In the thirteenth Choynskl brought
blood from Ryan's nose again and Con

Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENNES, Aug. 29.â Neither side
was pleased with the outcome
of to-day's proceedings before
the court-martial that is try-
ins Captain Dreyfus. The Drey
fusards expected that Colonel Cordier,
who was deputy chief of the Intelli
gence Department under the late Lieu
tenant Colonel Henry, would testify
that the bordereau was received di
rectly by the late Colonel Sandherr.
Had the expectation been realized, the
testimony would have been a strong
point In favor of the accused, because it
would have been a reply to the anti-
Dreyfusards who have all along con
tended that Henry received the border
eau and forwarded it to Sandherr, a
thing he would not have done had the
bordereau been, as the Dreyfusards
assert, written by his accomplice, Es
terhazy, for in that event Henry would
have recognized the handwriting when
he received the bordereau from the
German Embassy and would have sup
pressed it instead of forwarding it to
Sandherr.
Colonel Cordier, however, testified
to-day that he was absent from the
Intelligence Department when the bor
dereau arrived, but that he believed
that it was received by Henry. Natur
ally this statement elated the anti-
Dreyfusards, but they had no good
reason to congratulate themselves
upon the remainder of Cordier's testi
mony, as it was wholly in favor of
Dreyfus.
On the other hand, the procession of
generals and officers of the general
staff who demanded an opportunity to
confront Colonel Cordier was a good
piece of tactics from the point of view j
of the anti-Dreyfusards, because all j
points they contested were not of the
first importance, yet their very ap
pearance on the stage and the contra
dictions of some of Cordier's state
ments left a disagreeable impression.
The appearance of General Mercier
to question Colonel Cordier came as a
surprise to many in the audience, who
had supposed that after last Saturday's
scene, when Mercier was confronted
with Captain Freystmeter, he would
remain quiet. But Mercier is game to
the death. His action to-day is inter
preted as Intended to show that he is
not going to throw up the sponge. The
part he played in 1894 lays bim open to
arrest, and this is a constant topic of
discussion in the cafes and at other
meeting places in Rennes. There ap
pears, however, to be a good reason
why the Government will not take any
such serious step until tlie trial is over.
Colonel Jouaust, president of the
court-martial, could adjourn the trial
finitely if Mercier, who is an im
portant witness, were arrested. If the
trial were adjourned for more than
forty-eight hours it would lapse and
the proceedings would have to be gone
over again from the beginning.
To-day's attendance was the largest
since the opening of the trial. Every
body was on the gui vive to hear the
testimony of Charles de Freycinet, Sen
ate'!*, formerly Premier, former Minister
of Foreign Affairs and former Minister
of War. Tius adroit politician, the
"white mouse" of French politics, sat
upon the fence as well as he could. His
expression of a fear that the Dreyfus
agitation would injure the discipline of
the army greatly annoyed the Drey
fusards as calculated to influence the
Judges against the accused. But he

followed lt with a eulogy of the pioneer
of the Dreyfus campaign, M. Scheurer-
Kestner, former vice president of the
Senate, whose character, he said, he
held in the highest esteem.
M. Labori then secured another con
cession favorable to Dreyfus by getting
M. de Freycinet to admit that he could
not recall a single fact going' to prove
that money had been sent into France
from abroad to promote a campaign in
favor of Dreyfus. The general feeling,
however, was that his appearance on
the witness stand has not materially
helped the accused.
DREYFUS IS GAINING
POWERFUL FRIENDS
Colonel Cordier Gives Strong Evi-
dence in Favor of the Ac-
cused Man.
RENNES, Aug. 29.â General Mercier.
the former Minister of War, and most of
the other generals interested in the case
were present in the hall of the Lycee this
morning when the second session of tne
fourth week of the trial by court-martial
of Captain Alfred Dreyfus of the
artillery, charged with treason, was
opened.
Colonel Cordier, deputy chief of the
Intelligence Department under the late
Lieutenant Colonel Henry, and who since
his previous appearance in court, had
been released by the Minister of War,
General Marquis de Gallifet, from his
oath of professional secrecy, was the
first witness called to-day. He testified
to the effect that the iate Colonel Sand
herr and not Lieutenant Colonel Henry
received the famous bordereau.
The witness deposed strongly in favor
of Dreyfus, and he kept the court and
even the Judges in roars of laughter by
his comical manner and witticisms. 11. is
a short, stout man with a jolly face
and a'v cry red nose. The colonel declared
that his belief in the guilt of Dreyfus was
flrst shaken when the date of the bor
dereau was given as May. He was now
convinced Dreyfus was innocent.
Colonel Cordier then spoke up strongly
for Colonel Picquart as a conscientious
soldier and an honorable man and threw
light upon the situation which existed
in the offices of the Intelligence Depart
ment of the War Offlce. He explained
that Henry was jealous of Picquart be
cause tht latter was given charge of the
statistical department,' which Henry had
hoped to get for "himself. Cordier ex
pressed the belief that lt was because of
Picquart that Henry committed his
forgery.
The evidence of Colonel Cordier was
delivered in a loud voice, accompanied by
humorous asides. He several times men-
tioned the Ambassador of Germany,
which caused the president of the court.
Colonel Jouaust, to intervene and tell the i
witness that he must not intioduce the!
ambassador's name or refer to Germany. j
The hasty corrections of the witness
when he repeated the same slips of the j
tongue, as he did more than once, and
the amusing manner in which he avoided
mentioning Germany at other times,
caused the greatest merriment. During
his testimony no fewer than five wit-
nesses rose and asked to be confronted
with him. But the colonel received the
Interruptions with the utmost good
humor.
Dreyfus spoke a few words at the con-
elusion of /Colonel Cordier's statements.
He said the scene which preceded his ar-
rest was so fantastic that it completely
bewildered him, and merely left a blunted
impression on his memory.
lhe prisoner is now accustomed to his
surroundings and las apparently recov
ered his self-confidence, as he speaks
readily and clearly and follows the wit-
nesses closely, taking notes of various
points of their depositions.
Major Lauth tirst confronted Colonel
Cordier and tried to score against him by
pointing out that Cordier was incorrect
in saying there were no anti-Semites on
the general staff since Cordier himself
was one. The colonel retorted, turning
the tables on the major, as raising his
hand lie cried:
"Quite true. I was an anti-Semite, but
I never bore fal^e witness against the
Jew. I am an honest man."
The audience applauded these remarks.
Colonel Cordier then administered a
well deserved snub to Major Lauth by
remarking that he (the colonel) might be
allowed to know more than Major Lauth,
with reference to the work of the Intelli
gence Department, since he (Cordier; re
placed Colonel Sandherr as chief of the
department, whenever Sandherr was ab-
sent, while Major Lauth, th. witness con-
eluded, "was merely my assistant, my
assistant, mark you."
Major Lauth did not enjoy this little
scene at all.
General Koget next confronted .Colonel
Cordier. The general assumed the same
supercllllous air which characterized him
when he appeared at the witness bar,
strutting about the stage in disdainful
attitudes. His evidence, however, was
not very striking nor was that of Colonel
Fleur nor Archivist Gribelln, who also
contested minor points of Cordier's depo
sition.
Finally General Merrier, who evidently
appeared in order to demonstrate the
baselessness of the stories of his inten
i tions to fly and to show his determination
to fight to the last, confronted Colonel
Cordier. The general's remarks were of
small Importance, the most interesting
being his repetition of Colonel Sandherr's
opinion of Matthieu Dreyfus, when the
prisoner's brother went to see the colonel
to ask for. justice in behalf of Captain
Dreyfus. Mercier admitted Sandherr
said: .'*':â¢ ' -X-. *'*-'â - *: â â¢*-â ,â â â¢'* â -*./
"Matthieu Dreyfus impressed me as an
honest man, who was prepared to make
any sacrifice to save his brother."
. M- de Freycinet, the former Minister of
War, former Minister of Foreign Affairs
and former Premier, followed Colonel
Cordier on the witness stand. The court-
room was packed to its utmost capacity
as the distinguished French statesman be-
gan his deposition. He is a venerable
looking man with scanty snow-white hair
and mustache and was dressed in a blue
serge suit. He wore a little black bow
for a necktie and gave his testimony seat
ed and in a low voice.
The witness was expected to speak
about the 35,000.000 francs supposed to
have been contributed abroad, mainly in
England and Germany, to the Drey-
fusian war chest.l
M. de Freycinet began by expressing the
pain which he experienced at the troubles
nis country was undergoing. Later he
said he remembered a conversation with
General Jamont, at which there was a
reference to money coming from abroad
in support of the Dreyfus agitation
which, while disinterested in France,
might not be so abroad. M. de Freycinet,
however, -did not remember the details
of the conversation, nor could he say if
any specific amount was mentioned.
M. de Freyclnet then alluded to his fear
that "attacks on the chiefs of the army
THE SAN FRAN CISCO' CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 30, 1899.
might be prejudicial to discipline," add
ing:
"Might not these attacks lead to the dis
appearance of discipline, and what then
would be the result if we found ourselves
in difficulties with a foreign country?"
In short, M. de Freycinet delivered a pa
triotic speech rather thaji a deposition,
concluding with the words, "All the world
will accept your verdict, which will open
an era of reconciliation."
Following are the more important pro
ceedings in detail:
The appearance of Colonel Cordier, for
merly Deputy Chief of the Intelligence
Department at the Dreyfus court-martial,
aroused great interest. Speaking In firm,
audible tones, the colonel testified that
September 23. 1594, he left Paris on a
fortnight's leave of absence and that
nothing was then known in the statistical
department of the War Office of the dis
covery of treason.
Continuing, Colonel Cordier said that
the day after he returned to Paris Colonel
Sandherr, greatly distressed, handed him
a copy of the bordereau on foolscap
paper. Colonels Cordier and Sandherr
animatedly discussed the bordereau,
Sandherr considering it ample evidence
of treason. The bordereau was photo
graphed and tin investigation instituted.
resulting In suspicion against Dreyfus
being aroused. Prior to this there was
no presumption of Dreyfus' guilt. It was
October 8 that, the suspicions of the. pris
oner's guilt became definite. Witness said
he believed the bordereau arrived at the
War Office after September 24. He could
not say who received it. Very few officers
were then aware that treason had been
committed. Witness thought it necessary
to enter these particulars in reply to the
statements of his assistant. Major Lauth,
before the Court of Cassation.
At this point Major Lauth, rising In the
center of the court, exclaimed:
"I beg leave to speak, my colonel."
Proceeding with his testimony, Colonel
Cordier said hÂ« believed the bordereau
was handed to Colonel Sandherr by Col
onel Henry. Cordier then explained what
was "the ordinary channel" by which in
formation reached the War Offlce.
"The ordinary channel." the witness .
said, was a very clever spy attached to
the intelligence department, who had the
habit of visiting great houses but who
preferred the company of servants to the
company of their masters. *â â¢-'.'â¢;â *.
Cordier described the method of piecing
documents and showed how the bordereau
was pasted together by Henry', who was
usually Intrusted with such work. "Like
the passion of fortune-telling by cards,
men who have once pieced paper," said
the witness, amidst laughter, "will always
continue to do ho."
Referring to the spy who had been
dubbed as "the ordinary channel," Colonel
Cordier said the former did not directly
receive documents from the embassy from
AFTER THE SHOOTING OF LABORI.
While awaiting the arrival of a litter the wounded counsel for Dreyfus was
supported in the arms of his wife,â From a sketch in Petit Bleu.
which they were, abstracted. A woman,
be explained, served as an intermediary
and the ordinary channel having been
closed it was found necessary to negotiate
directly with the intermediary, otherwise
the woman with whom rendezvous were
usually made in churches. But as the
"ordinary channel's" services were still
available elsewhere his pay was con
tinued. Possibly, continued the witness,
the spy endeavored to renew his relations
with the embassy. Such was the situation
at the moment of the reception of the bor
dereau.
Dealing with the leakage discovered by
the military authorities, Colonel Cordier
said he ascertained it was occurring. at
Bourges. Witness recalled the fact that
an artificer named Thomas was sentenced
for treason in 1894. The foreign corre
spondents did not notice his arrest, and
consequently a letter addressed to him
was intercepted and a reply sent. This
letter asked for plans of a shell, The
headquarters staff obtained the plans and
sent them to Thomas' correspondents.
The latter replied, thanking Thomas and
inclosing bank notes, which were credited
to the funds of the headquarters staff.
Whatever has been said to the contrary,
witness maintained that the leakage at
Bourges could not be ascribed to Drey
fus This was also the opinion of Colonel
Sandherr, who frequently had recourse to
witness' intimate knowledge in this ques
tion, of the futile efforts to discover evi
dence against Dreyfus.
Cordier whose evidence greatly inter
ested his hearers, described the various
leakages He especially referred to a very
serious case designated as "leakage of St.
Thomas Aquinas," in which a clerk of the
Church of St. Thomas Aquinas, Paris,
was mixed up in espionage and a serious
leakage in the Ministry of Marine. The
witness recalled how. information of the
leakage of 1594 was received primarily.
The name mentioned was that of a gentle
man 45 years old and decorated, who used
to convey documents to the embassy,
which the witness described as a house
with a large garden.
Colonel Cordier emphasized the fact that
the foregoing personal description did not
bear the sligntest resemblance to Dreyfus,
but resembled much more closely another
officer whose name had been mentioned
and who could no longer be prosecuted or
â Cordier then described the events prior
to the arrest of Dreyfus, and showed that
only a single real leakage, namely, the
plans of the fortress, had occurred at the
time of his arrest. The document known
as "cette canaille de D ," he explained,
was contemporaneous with this leakage.
"It has been said," continued the wit
ness, "that I made a mistake on this
point and confounded the document with
another containing the initial alone. I
should like very much to see the docu
ment in order to assure myself that It had
not been tampered with. It is not, how
ever, of any Importance, except to show
that General Roget's evidence concerning
me is false from beginning to end." (Sen
sation.)
Reverting to the manner in which the
suspicions against Dreyfus crystallized.
the colonel described the efforts to pry ',
into the prisoner's life, and said the in- !
formation at first received was very bad
and constituted strong proof against the ]
prisoner. Later, however, it assumed
quite a different aspect. It was admitted :
that before his marriage Dreyfus was not j
"unimpeachable morally, nor was he en- 'â 
titled to wear a wreath of orange blos- j
soms." (Laughter.) "But," continued
Colonel Cordier, "after his marriage |
Dreyfus was quite different."
The witness also said that while Drey
fus boasted of his conquests, he (Cordier) j
was of the opinion that those who boasted
the most accomplished the least. (Laugh
ter.)
. Dreyfus, he continued, bragged a great
deal, and probably now repented having:
done so. Dreyfus' Inqulsitlveness, accord
ing to the witness, was probably explained
by his knowledge that he would not re- |
main long on the headquarters staff and j
he desired to obtain all information which
might be useful to him in after life.
The colonel then paid a tribute to the
memory of Colonel Sandherr, who exam
ined the Immense mass of documents re
lating to espionage and unearthed the
"Cette canaille de Dâ document, which
seemed to the witness to date back to
antiquity.
In 1894 the witness regarded as insuffi
cient the sole proof against Dreyfus. I
namely, the bordereau. He did not be- j
lieve the prisoner was guilty, but the fact I
that the judges were unanimous in con- j
victing him changed the witness' mind. j
His doubts, however, returned when he
saw that the date of the bordereau re
ceived in September had been fixed as
May. Colonel Picquart's Investigation
and the infamous campaign against Pic- ;
quart increased the suspicions of the wit
ness.
"In 1894," declared Colonel Cordier, em
phatically, "I had been reassured by the
unanimity' of the judges, and 1 was abso
lutely convinced of the guilt of Dreyfus.
Now I am absolutely convinced of his
innocence." (Great excitement.)
Next the witness discussed the attacks
on himself. He said he was astonished at
being accused of being soured because he I
was not given charge of the intelligence I
department in succession to Colonel Sand- !
herr, "as every one knew I wished to quit
the service simultaneously with my friend
Sandherr."
Replying to the president. Cordier de- â¢
clared that the approaches of the Dreyfus I
family to Colonel Sandherr were not at- i
tempts at corruption and that Dreyfus' j
brother's remark. "Our fortune is at your â 
disposal," was only the expression of the .
family's ardent desire to save an inno- j
cent member of it.
M. Labor! questioned the witness in re
gard to the letter mentioned In M. de la
Roche Yernot's evidence referring to the |
spy, "C. C. C," which was dispatched to i
the War Offlce at the time of Picquart's
arrival. Cordier explained that it was a :
letter from an Italian lady with whom the j
department was at that time in corre
spondence through an Intermediary at the '
Foreign Office.
"I greatly respect Italian ladles in gen
eral, said Colonel Cordier, "but not when !
lt Is a case of espionage, and- I advised i
Picquart not to make too much use of the I
lady's offers, saying to him, 'there must j
be no petticoats.' "
Major Lauth, being permitted to speak, i
said Colonel Cordier's leave of absence
commenced September 15, and not Septem- i
ber 23, to which Cordier replied that he
was surprised at contradiction on such an !
unimportant point, but, nevertheless, his I
original statement was true.
Continuing, the major commented upon
Colonel Cordier's testimony, especially the t
statement that there were no anti-Semites
on the headquarters staff, remarking that
there was one exception, and this was
Cordier himself, who always was express
ing antipathy toward Jews, especially
when there was a question of introducing
Dreyfus to the department.
"Yes,," exclaimed Cordier, "quite true.
I was an anti-Semite^ but my opinions
never went to the length of bringing false
evidence against the Jews. (Sensation.) i
I am an honest man and I have a con- |
science." (Renewed sensation.)
Major Lauth proceeded to discuss other !
points. He said he himself pieced the !
"cette canaille de D " and added that
as it was only received at the department j
at the end of 1893, It could not be regarded
as ancient. He explained that the tension
existing in the department was between !
the officers and Colonel Cordier. \
When the President asked Cordier if he ;
desired to say anything in rebuttal of
Major Lauth's statement, Cordier replied: !
"Nothing at all." â¢ - :.
When, however, the major asserted, in
regard to the letter "C. C. C." that Cor- I
dier had nothing to do with the Italian
affairs which Sandherr conducted, Cor
dier arose and said:
"As deputy chief I was acquainted with
all the work done, while Major Lauth was
merely my assistant." -;â¢
At this juncture Major Lauth handed In
a letter from Madame Sandherr contra
dicting Colonel Cordier's statement rela
tive to the presence of Sandherr at the |
War Offlce on a certain day.
General Koget then mounted the plat
form, where his appearance caused a gen
eral stir. He said he would not reply to
Colonel Cordier's statements concerning
himself, "but," he added, "the witness
has stated that what I said was false.
He must now say ln what I have been in
correct." ''i. V-
Colonel Cordierâ ln everything. ; -, vr.
General Rogetâ Very well. Let us be ex
act. Let us take the case of .Le Mercier-
Picard. *â¢ _
Continuing, General Roget entered into
a lengthy explanation, denouncing Le
Mercier-Picard as an imposter and swin
dler, apparently with the. object of show
ing that Cordier's allegations that Mer
cler-Plcard was employed by the general
staff was unfounded. Roget also referred
to a letter to Matthieu Dreyfus attributed
to Cordier, whereupon the latter again
arose and protested against General Ro
get's Insinuations. He declared that when
it became known that he was going to tes
tify he was covered with mud and treated
as a drunkard in order to minimize the
value of his evidence,,. He also emphatic
ally protested against a statement of the
Libre Parole that he offered his services
to Matthieu Dreyfus and said the Minister
of War had authorized him (the witness)
to prosecute the newspaper, In regard to
the forged letter to Matthieu Dreyfus,
continued Cordier, investigation has
shown that Le Mercier-Picard undoubt
edly forged it.
Colonel Fleur appeared in the witness
box to refute Colonel Cordier's testimony.
He declared that August 23, 189S, Colonel
Cordier said to him:
"Dreyfus is guilty, but there must be
two others. There are three of them."
Colonel Cordier shrugged his shoulders
and admitted that just a week before the
arrest of Henry he said forgery had been
committed at the headquarters staff, but,
the colonel added, he told the same thing
to others the day after the posting up of
the speech of M. Cavaignac, the Minister
of War, was voted by the Chamber of
Deputies. ;v V- â¢'- 2-
The name of M. de Freyclnet was called,
and amid suppressed excitement the
former Minister of Foreign Affairs and
former Premier took the witness stand.
M. Demange proceeded to question the
former Minister. Counsel recalled Gen
eral Mereier's statement that M. de Frey
cinet told M. J&mont that 25,000,000 francs
had been raised for the defense of Drey
fus. In reply M. de Freycinet described
the anguish he felt at the sight of the
trouble into which his country was
plunged, and his desire was to see peace
and calm restored. In regard to the con
versation referred to the. witness said:
"General Jamont made me a visit of
courtesy on the occasion of my quitting
oflice at the beginning of May. I re
ceived many similar visits. I do not
think I exaggerate when I say that I re
ceived a hundred such visits. I made no
note of the remarks exchanged by my
different visitors. In the case of Gen
eral Jamont we, of course, talked about
the case and the campaign speeches and
press utterances which had been pro
ceeding in different parts of the world
during the previous two years. In re
gard to the Dreyfus case I was led to
say that our agents abroad reported that
efforts had been made on the initiative of
private individuals in behalf of this
campaignâ very disinterested campaign
in France, I am sure, but less so abroad.
I reported the estimates I had heard had
been made by people who professed to
be well acquainted with the question of
advertising in regard to the probable
money value of the whole campaign
throughout the world since its inception.
That, Monsieur le PrcsiTlent. is a re
sume as complete as my recollection per
mits of the conversation with General
Jamont. What struck me most was the
identity of our anxiety in regard to the
army. We mutually expressed uneasi
ness, for it must be conceded that the
present attacks have had a profound
echo, which might eventually endanger
the cohesion of the army. You know
well, gentlemen, that there is a higher
discipline than even the military code, as
I said In the Chamber. It is that more
rigorous discipline which comes from the
confidence of .he soldier in his chiefs.
How can that confidence be maintained
if these chiefs are depicted daily in the
blackest colors? Was lt not to be feared
that at a given moment this confidence
would disappear, and what would be the

difficulties? (Sensation.)
"I adjure those of my countrymen,"
continued M. de Freycinet. earnestly.
"who participate in these attacks under
the impulse of generous passion and with
the object' of serving a noble, elevated
ideaâ l have no doubt they are led away
âto take heed in the dangers to which
they may involve the country. As Gen
efal Jamont said to me. 'It is high time, to
end it.' Let us cease throwing in one an
other's faces accusations which discredit
us iii the eyes of our rivals. Gentlemen,
let us prepareâ and I would that my fee
ble voice could be heard by allâ us
prepare to receive and accept your judg
ment with respect and silence. May the
judgment of this French court, toward
which the whole world has its eyes turned,
open up the era of reconciliation wnich is
so necessary. (Immense excitement.)
"Gentlemen, pardon me for telling you
what I wish. It springs from a heart
which has no longer much to desire here
below except to live to see the country
great and honored. I have finished. I
have given an exact account of the in
terview with the commander-in-chief of
our army in time of war. I have nothing
to add.''
M. de Freycinet had fully maintained his
title to the nickname "The Little White
Arouse," which was bestowed upon him
on account of his ability to speak length
ily without conveying much information.

COLOGNE GAZETTE ON
THE RENNES TRIAL
Says Germany Has Done as Much, as
Could Be Expected to Clear â¢
Dreyfus.
BERLIN, Aug. 29.â The Cologne Gazette
to-day, in an inspired article replying to
the foreign press, says:
"After the failure of Major Panlssr.ardi
and Colonel Schneider to convince the peo
ple, Colonel Schwarzkoppen's intervention
In behalf of ono innocently sentenced
would /be futile, especially since Germany
has already done more than could he ex
pected by Count yon Bulow's silemn dec

DISCLAIM KNOWLEDGE
OF AN EXTRA SESSION
Currier and Smith Say Burns Will
Have a Hard Fight if One
Is Called.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 29.â Senators
Currier of Spadra and C. Smith of
Bakersfleld were in Los Angeles to- j
day. Senator Currier when approached â 
on the subject of an extra session of |
the â¢ Legislature disclaimed any ex- j
elusive knowledge about the probabil- I
ity of one being called and said: "If j
such a session is- convened I shall go j
into caucus upon the Senatorship and
will abide by the action there taken. !
! That was my attitude last winter dur- ,
j ing the regular session, but I was out- j
i voted by a majority of the representa- j
tives from down this way. We should
have elected a Senator last winter and
not put the State to the expense of an j
extra session. Senator Bulla tells me
he will not go into caucus in the event
of an extra session. He seems to know !
where he stands now, which was not
the case at Sacramento the last time."
Senator Currier was a Bulla sup
porter during the regular session, later j
transferring his allegiance to U. S. i
Grant. : : '
Smith placed U. S. Grant's name be-
fore the joint session last winter and
has been looked upon as one of the
leaders of the anti-Burns element.
When asked what he knew regarding
an extra session he replied: "It is my
opinion there will be an extra session
some time about November."
"Does that mean the election of
Burns for Senator?" "Not necessarily.
At the close of the regular session and
after he had strained every nerve, Mr.
Burns had but thirty votes. Less than
half enough to elect. I am not pre-
pared to believe that he has secured
during the recess two votes to where
he then had one. I am much mistaken
if there has been any such change in
public sentiment in his favor.
"If the whole Republican vote is
present at a caucus I do not think he
can control it. But if he could get a
i caucus with about sixty-one votes j
' present he could probably get a ma- !
j jority of that number and thus bind the
! whole sixty-one. It is reported that
j sixty-one have agreed to go into cau-
I cus. I doubt that. I have not signed
I such an agreement, neither have I been
asked to. I do not know that there are
any other candidates at this time. Both
Grant and Barnes have declared them
selves out of the race. But if there is
an extra session there will be more
than one candidate in the race."

Purses.
The announcement that the 2:16 trot and
the 2:12 class for horses -of the lateral
gait, each for a $1000 purse, would both
be decidod at Oakland track yesterday
drew about the largest crowd that has yet
attended the Golden Gate Agricultural
Society's fair. As predicted by the know
ing ones? Neerata; the game little black
filly; annexed the trotting number, with
Arthur v securing the two necessary
heats to carry away first money in the
purse offeree! for pacers. In the running
events Juletto, Lost Girl and Novia were
the winners.
Judging from the odds laid against
"i* â¢'.! in the books it looked a fore
gone conclusion for the mare. Although
nine scored for the word the ring opened
her up an even money chance for. the
first heat. Our Lucky and Addison were
considered to have a great chance. Mamie
Riley drew the pole position, but. was out
footed to the turn. Our Lucky Boon
headed tlie field; showing the route home,
with Sable Frances and Neerata trailing.
Brooks behind the latter called on the
mare and in a long drive led Lucky past
the wire half a length in 2:16&. Sable
Frances was third and Ned Thorn fourth.
The heat winner alter this ruled a I to
5 chance, and landed in eighth position
et the second trial. Cut off and carried
to a break soon after the word, Brooks
made no further effort, Our Lucky taking
the heat handily from Sable Frances and
Ned Thorn. Five to two was laid against
the winner. - *
in the third and deciding heat, still a
warm favorite, Neerata came back trim
ami fresh, and passing Our Lucky before
the hall" was reached led the latter horse
out by. a length in 2:17%. Addison was
third on this occasion.
Great tilings ere expected of Beech
woo.i. Don, Deceiver and Bill Frazier. but
the quartet was apparently "not ready"â
especially the first name'!. Arthur \Y,
driven by Jobn Quinn, made it two
straight, and the race was over. In the
betting on the opening heat there was no
pronounced choice. Arthur \\\ Beechw 1
and Don all being quoted at about the
same oddsâ 2 to 1. Favored by good send
offs. Arthur VV never left the result in
doubt, winning both heats almost at
leisure in :i:lu. 2:15^. Deceiver was sec
ond in the first heat, with Bi echwood
taking that position the next time.
Then followed the runs. The first, a
five and a half furlong sprint for maid
en 2-year-olds, fell easy prey to Juletto.
The July filly went to the post favorite
over Druldess; and catching the latter
iii the sail home won hands down. Royal
Bengal was piloted into the show by
Joe Narvaez.
In th. seven-furlong run Lost Girl re
deemed herself for the defeat suffered on
the previous day. Closing second choice
in the books, the hardy marc overhauled
the lender, Widow .belies, and driving
hard earned the verdict by less' than a
length. Lovdal. the favorite, could never
pet to the front. The- winner was piloted
by Mills.
Jockey Eddie Jones on the 9 to in favor
ite- Novia made, a runaway race of the
final five and a half furlong spin, lead
ing Midlove out three lengths past the
stand. The latter acted badly at the
post, retarding her chances considerably.
Show honors went to Horatio.

the old '% and '97 teams, will at least give
a good account of itself. We realize that â 
we have to moot a veteran team from
across the bay, and are making all possi
ble, preparations for an interesting contest
Thanksgiving day.
"The material of the team is, for the
most part, untried in collegiate contests,
and complete reorganization of the team
will I"- necessary, so that to give with
accuracy a prospective line-up will be im
possible. Captain Murphy and 'Babe' Ben
nett will be hack at quarter and center,
respectively, while Parker and Rice will
be on the ends. The rest of the line-up is
rather uncertain.
"Our new coach. 'Burr' Chamberlain of
Harvard, will be here on September 1, and
as boon as he has looked over the mate

Parker of Denver.
DENVER. Aug. 29.â 8i11y Otts, the
clever lightweight from San Francisco,
again met defeat at the hands of Kid
Parker of Denver in the ninth round of
what was to have been a twenty-round
go, before the Olympic Athletic Club to
night. Otts was worn down by. the sheer
force of Parker's rushes and when, in the
ninth round, after being down three
times, taking the limit, he fell on his
knees from a stiff right hand punch in
the region of the heart, he was too weak
to come up again and. was counted out.
Otts was game to the core and several
times had the Kid badly worn from left
Jolts to the nose and chin. In the eighth
round Otts floored Parker with a stiff left
to face, The bout all through was very
fast. Bat Masterson officiated as referee.
In the preliminary Jimmy Scanlon of
Pittsburg failed to stop Billy Lewis of
Denver in ten rounds and lost the de
cision. Two thousand persons wero
present. *'; .;*;â '-, ;: '.;â¢,.::

Special Dispatch to The Call.
DUBUQUE, lowa. Aug. 29.â Tdolita,
owned by Frank Jones of Portsmouth,
N. H., pulled down the winner's share of
the rich Horse Review stake for three
year-old trotters to-day. The little bay
walked away from her field in each of the
three heats and won hands down. The
purse was worth $20,000 and was the third ;
of a series of Futurity offerings put up by |
John C. Bauer of Chicago. To-day's race !
was the fastest three-year-old Futurity j
ever trotted. The first heat was made ln j
the following time: :33, 1:06, 1:40. 2:124.
This was the fastest of the three heats
and equaled the three-year-old record in j
a class trot made at Louisville last year.
The money was divided as follows: i
Idolita. owned by Frank Jones, $9000; j
Ecstacy, owned by H. C. McDowell of
Lexington, $4500; Rita E. owned by H. W.
Brown of Salt Lake, $2250; lima Electrite, j
owned by Henry Axell, Dallas. Tex. $1250; |
My Trick, owned by Marcus Daly of Mon
tana, $500.
The balance of the purse was divided be- |
tween the nominators of the sires of the.
winner and the second horse. Of thi:/
amount the estate of Senator Stanford
secured $2000.
Idolita, the favorite in the betting, was
never in danger of losing the race. He led i
all the way in the first heat. Coming
down the stretch Ecstacy challenged the i
leader, but broke fifty feet from the wire '
and lost what looked like a chance for the
first honors of the heat. Crystalline
broke at the start and, with Longan. was
distanced.
In the second heat Ecstacy broke again,
this time at the quarter. Idolita went out \
to the front and took the ground easily.
There was a hard struggle from the half
pole to the wire between Rita E and
Daly's colt, My Trick, for second place.
The Montana colt closed up a gap of
twenty lengths and came in only a halt
length behind Rita E. This heat was
slow, in 2:14#.
Again in the third heat Idolita cut out !
the pace. Ecstacy broke at the half, but |
caught her gait and came down the |
stretch neck and neck with Rita E, and
this time beat the latter to the wire by
a nose in a furious drive. Oracle Onward
was a close fourth, with the others well ,
up. The time of this heat was :33M., 1:06%,
1:39, 2:14.
The 2:20 pace, worth $3*900, was easy
money for the favorite, Robert Fitzslm
mons. In the third heat Arbutaskan
challenged Shade On at the last turn for
second money. They closed up a gap of
twenty lengths on Fitzsimmons and
Shade On nosed out Becond prize. They â ,
forced Robert to do this heat in 2:o&}i,
which he did with great ease.
The first heat of the third race, the i
Central stake of $3000 for 2:12 class trot
ters, furnished the prettiest race of the ]
meeting. Coming into the stretch the
field was well bunched, with Copeland,
the favorite, on the pole. At the last
turn Altoka and Humboldt Maid pulled
out of the bunch, followed by Aragon K.
The three raced down the stretch side.
by side and finished noses apart. The
three remaining heats went to Sir Charles
in slow time. Copeland broke continu
ally and was unable to get inside the
money. Mr. Spellman gave the crowd a
sensation In the third heat by pulling out
of the bunch at the half and setting a
clipping pace well into the stretch, where
Sir Charles headed him and took down
the purse. , ,
To-day's weather was nearly perfect for
racing, perhaps a trifle too warm. In the
neighborhood of 15,000 people saw the con
tests. Summaries:

the title of champion pugilist of the world.

Brady. The only condition imposed upon
Corbett was that he post a forfeit of $1000
as a guarantee of good faith as soon as
all arrangements for the Sharkey-Jeffries
fight are completed. This Corbett has
agreed to do. Corbett says that the rest
he has enjoyed for several months has
done him a lot of good and his health is
better now than it has been for some time.
Sharkey will begin training to-morrow
for his contest with Jeffries. He has
chosen New Dorp, Staten Island, for his
preparatory work. Sharkey will be trained
by Herrick of Providence, R. I. Herrick
will devote part of his time to sparring
with Sharkey, with the Idea of making the
sailor pugilist fast and clever with his

Mrs. Naomi Baker, aged 21 years, died
in the City and County Hospital Sunday
afternoon from injuries received by being
brutally assaulted by three men, for
whom Captain Bohen and his men are
now searching. The assault occurred
about three weeks ago.
The unfortunate woman had been visit
ing a friend, and shortly before midnight
she started for her home, on Stevenson .
street. When within a short distance of
her house she was accosted by three men,
one of whom demanded her purse. .- Be
coming alarmed she started to scream for
the police, when the ruffians attacked her.
After knocking her down they repeatedly
kicked her and then robbed her of her
purse, containing $3.
A young man named Fred Murray hap
pened to see her lying on the sidewalk,
and at her request he took her to a lodg
ing-house at 42 Turk street. As her condi
tion became serious Murray induced her
to go with him to the City and County .
Hospital, where she was placed in the' fe
male ward. =:i "-'Â£*/'>â¢
Sunday she passed away, and as she was
without friends or money her remains
were Interred in a pauper's grave.
The day on which she died Captain Bo
hen received a letter from Thomas Baker,
who lives at Oxnard, Ventura County,
asking him to find Mrs. Naomi Baker,
who was supposed to be in the city. . Ho
described her as being an attractive look
ing woman of 21 years. The writer bald
that she left her home at Oxnard, but did
not state whether he was her husband or
some close relative. The head of the de
tective department turned the letter over
to Detective Bohen, with Instructions to
do all in his power to find the missing
woman. Last evening the police were in
formed that Mrs. Baker had died in the
City and County Hospital and that her
body had been interred in a pauper's
grave. ' i'x^. -*y yXXZZ 'ZX. ;'*':'-Â«--
As soon as it became known that the
unfortunate woman had died presumably
from the effects of the beating she had
received, Captain Bohen detailed two of
his best men to arrest her assailant.
Subsequent inquiry by them developed the
fact that three men. who were suspected
of having assaulted her, were arrested by
Police Officer Peterson, but as they satis
fied the police of their Innocence, the
were not detained. . ;,-;.*
The detectives who are working on the
case have been instructed to rearrest
the men, as it is believed that they can
throw some light on the tragedy.
Ben Bekowlch, a tailor, .who lives on
Folsom street, above Fifth, was arrested
shortly before midnight last night by
Policeman Peterson and locked up in the
tanks pending an investigation.
Bekowlch was one of the three men
who was suspected of having assaulted
Mrs. Baker. When questioned the pris
oner stated that he knew nothing of the
details of the affair and he. did not know
the names of the other two men.

LATE THOMAS CARTER

Will and Failed to Keep

ONE of the most novel suits ever
brought in California was filed witn
ONE of the most novel suits ever
brought in California was filed witn
the County Clerk to-day. On its
face it is simply the case of a
woman seeking to recover $10,000
from a dead millionaire's .estate under a
contract, but in reality It is the finale of
a breach of promise suit that at one time
promised to be very sensational. The mat-;
ter was settled at the time, but now the j
whole story is to be told in court. The
promised litigation will be over a portion
of the wealth left by Thomas Carter, the
millionaire car builder of Newark, Ala-
meda County, and the progress of the
case will develop the only love affair of a
hot-headed, passionate couple. Twice
during his lifetime was Carter sued by his
lady love for breach of promise and twice
he compromised. Now that he is dead the
lawsuit has descended to his heirs and
they have no compunction about fighting
the claim to a finish.
Thomas Carter had not a large circle of
personal friends, hut the firm name of
Carter Bros, is known from Maine to
Florida. All the cars of the Central and
Southern Pacific railroads and those used
on nearly every street car line in Califor
nia. Oregon and Washington were built
by them. John and Martin Carter at-
tended to the workshop and Thomas, as
the head of the house, attended to all the
outside business. He was interest i with
the late Senator Fair and A. E. I 'avis in
the building of the Santa Cruz narrow
gauge line and was also in a number of
ventures with the late Senator Stanford.
All his speculations turned out well and
when he died Thomas Carter's estate was
valued at "over a million.'"
Thomas Carter never cared about the !
society of women, but about fifteen years j
ago lie met Miss "Mollie" Redmond; a
handsome brunette and was at once taken
captive by her charms. They became
warm friends, and it is alleged that 1
Carter proposed - marriage. Then sud
denly the lovers made a discovery.
Each of them had a most violent
temper. After a stormy scene they
parted "never to meet again" as they ;
both said. Before a week was ..'it Carter I
was back again suing for forgiveness.
It went on In this way for years. First j
there would be an outbreak and then they j
would kiss and make it up again. On
every occasion Carter would vow that if
he couldn't marry "Mollle" Redmond he i
would never marry anybody. He kept his ]
vow and died a bachelor.
One day several years ago the lovers I

were broken and they parted bitter ene

upon Henry E. Highton %and the result
was a breach of promise suit for $150,000.
The rase never went into court, as Carter
compromised. A week after everything
was settled he was back in Miss Red

though such a thing as a breach of prom

way. Quarreling and making it up, they
saw the months slip by until there was
another violent outbreak, and another
breach of promise suit followed. On this

Highton and besought him to use his in
lluence with Miss Redmond to have the
case dismissed. Mr. Highton refused to
move in the matter, holding that after
the first settlement Carter was clear of
Miss Redmond and should have stayed
away. Instead of that, he went back,
like the moth to the dame, and had no
right to kick when he got singed again.
Carter then went to Miss Redmond, and
on his promising her, in the presence of
witnesses, that he would leave her fIO.OOO

he was dead. Miss Redmond did not hear
of his death until the last moment, and
she had barely time to reach the vi dor
taker's before the coffin lid was screwed
down.
For -.'. few weeks after his death there
was no will forthcoming and Miss Ktd

William Q. Black, a nephew of the dead
millionaire, asked to be appointed special

to the front and he filed the will for pro

of her when he wrote "after the payment

Thomas Carter disposed of his millions
in the following manner:

Casey, the Australian crook, who is
suspected of being one of the men who
robbed the specie room of the steamer
Alameda, has made a confession to Chief
Lees. Just whom he implicates the head
of the Police Department refuses to di-
vulge.
Casey's confession -was not unexpected
by the detectives who have been engaged
in unearthing evidence against him. Yes
terday he was taken before Judge Muras
ky on a writ of habeas corpus sworn out
by his friend. "Teddy'- Alexander. Casey
was represented by Attorney George Col
lins, who was prepared to make a hard
fight in behalf of his client. When the
hearing was called Collins announced that
he was ready to proceed, and addressing
the court started to argue the case. He
had scarcely uttered a dozen words when*
Chief Lees whispered something to Casey,
who immediately interrupted his attorney
in his flight of eloquence.
"I don't want to go on with the hear
ing," he quietly remarked to Collins.
"Have the case continued until Thurs
day." ....
Although surprised at the strange re
quest of his client. Collins made the- mo-
tion for a continuance, whicii was readily
granted. Casey was then led from tie-
courtroom by Detective Sullivan and
taken for a walk. 11.- was returned to
the prison two hours later and placed in
the "tanks."
Last evening Casey sent word to Chief
Lees that he was anxious to tell all he
knew. Detective Ellis was sent to the'
prison to get him. and he was promptly
escorted to the .eflice of the- head of the
department. They were closeted together
for over twee hours, after which Casey
was returned to his cell in the City
Prison.
When asked about Casey's confession.
Chief Lees vigorously denied that he had
"squealed."
"I don't intend to cripple myself by giv-
ing out any information about the case,"
he remarked. "We are getting along very
well with the matter and are confident
of eventually landing Howard, the arch-
conspirator, as well asp the men who
robbed the strongbox of the Alameda.
That is all 1 have to say."
From another source, however, it is
known that Casey could not longer stand
the "sweating" process and he decided to
make a clean breast of his connection with
the robbery. He first sent for Detective
Gibson, to whom he confided his intention
and asked him to inform Chief I, ees.
The fact that the latter whispered to
Casey just as the hearing of the writ of
habeas corpus was commenced and which
resulted in the matter being continued, is
: presumed to mean that Lees held out
some inducement to the prisoner, who
readily instructed his attorney to postpone
i the hearing. "Jack" Kelly, who is also
suspected of being one of the Alameda
j robbers, is still at large, but through the
confession of Casey the police now know
of his whereabouts. His arrest is ex
pected at any moment.
yesterday the detectives arrested a man
named Harris, who was with Casey when
he returned from his trip to New Orleans.
On being questioned he said he met Casey
on the train and did not know of any of
his crooked transactions. As he clearly
established his innocence he was shortly
afterward released.

PASSED AWAY IN THE
FLOWER OF HER YOUTH
MISS MARY CRAIG SPILLANE.
n ra ARY CRAIG SPILLANE, daughter of Police Captain John Spillane, died
l/\//\t suddenly at 1! o'clock Monday night at the family residence, 1202 Jones
II ).( Vy street, of septic blood poisoning, superinduced by an ulcerated tooth. The
ii iii\ l>young lady had suffered for a week previous, when her cheek became
"very much swollen, and three days ago was obliged to take to her bed. No imme
diate danger was anticipated, however, and her untimely taking off came as a ter
rible shock to her parents and her brother- Thomas G. Spillane, all of whom
were with her when she passed away.
Drs. Keeney, Shumate and Hynes did all In their power to save the young life,
but their efforts were unavailing. Vicar General Prendergast administered the
last holy rites of the Catholic Church to the dying woman and he had no sooner
uttered the concluding words of the sacrament when she closed her eyes as if in
sleep and the sad end came.
It is thought that the young lady's system had been absorbing the poison from
the ulcerated tooth ever since it was treated last February, but beyond a little
fever now and then and some restlessness at night her condition gave no cause
for alarm.
At the time of her death Miss Spillane was 23 years, of age. She was horn in
this city and educated in the Academy of the Madames of the Sacred Heart, at
Franklin and Ellis streets. She possessed an uncommon talent for music, in which
she had attained a remarkable degree of proficiency and had met with great sue-
cess as a teacher of the art. She had a fine soprano voice and displayed a re-
markable aptitude for singing. She had taken part in amateur concerts and was
at all times willing to assist in charitable affairs. She was deeply interested in
the approaching bazaar in aid of the Youths' Directory and had collected a
large sum of money in Its behalf. "â¢ â  â¢â â¢-

MILLIONS OF CAPITAL
FOR CHINA'S TRADE
Consul Ho Vow's Gigantic Pro-
ject Under Way.
Oriental Emperor to Give Especial Trade
Privileges to â  Americans to Prevent
Annihilation by European Powers.
One of the largest commercial and in- I
dustrial movements of the world is now
receiving the serious consideration of a
number of Chinese and American capi
talists of this city. Reference has been
made to it once or twice in the press, but
the importance of the project has never
been fully explained or generally under
stood. The proposition is the formation
of a United States and China trading com
pany, the scope of which will reach into
every branch of the industries of the
two great nations. Meetings looking to
th.- creation of such an organization are
being held here frequently, the capital
here as well as in the East and China is
becoming interested.
The flrst public notice of this movement
was issued by Ho Vow, the Consul-Gen
eral of China in this city, who sent out
a number of circulars to the commercial
bodies of this city, the East and in China.
The representative of the Flowery King
dom has always distinctly stated that his
acts in this matter were unofficial, but
for all this his broadmindedness has been
criticized by those either lenorant of his
purpose or' fearful for personal reasons.
in nis unofficial -communication Ho Vow
says:
China territorially considered, la almost a
terra incognita, vet with her comparatively un
developed resources, her 400,000,000 of popula
tion a progressive Government and a desire
to obtain all the advantages of western civili
zation, a most inviting Held is offered for
American capital, enterprise and ingenuity.
European nations have not been slow to recog
nize and take advantage of ttiese opportunities
and have Bought to obtain large territorial
concessions
The United States Government has always
maintained a passive attitude an.l has In con
sequence a material advantage that other na
tions lack. One who follows the daily trend
of events and Is conversant with the aggressive
and grasping policy of the diplomats of Eu
rope can readily realize the advantages that
may accrue to the citizens of the United
States through the liberal non-interference
policy of tins Government.
This quotation is the key to the situa
tion. a gentleman recently returned from
China states that the powers that be In
that country have recognized the neces
sity of becoming one of the recognized
civilized nations of the worldâ or be
chopped up territorially and parceled out
among the powers of Europe, which
means its annihilation as a nation. To
accomplish this by Its own power and re
sources is impossible, and a strong ally
Is necessary. America is China's only
hope, but the alliance must be commer
cial and not political. Ho Vow in his ad
dress refers to San Francisco as the nat
ural distributing center of the trade of
the Pacific Ocean, and "toward this point
must converge the greater part of the
trade that will eventually be developed
between China * * * and this country."
His proposition is to form a United
States and China trading company with
a capital of from live to fen million dol
lars, wth a general charter which will per
mit of the most extensive field of opera
tions, the scope of which will be deter
mined by the investors. Its purpose is to
deal as direct purchaser or agent in the
natural products or manufactured articles
of each country with a view of Introduc
ing American products into China; estab
lish branch houses in every treaty port
of China; arrange for and accept con
tracts for the construction of railways,
building of steamships, warships or other
vessels for th" Chinese Government or
private concerns; to form and promote
special syndicates, etc., and "In fact the
aim of the company shall be to take ad
vantage of each and every opportunity
that may appear to afford a profitable
outcome."
From reliable sources it is learned that
while the proposition of the Consul-Gen
eral is unofficial, it has the sanction of the
high powers of China. With this backing
such a company could secure and absorb
every franchise and concession within the
gift of the Chinese Government and the
granting of these concessions to such an
organization as contemplated would be
sufficient excuse for the Chinese Govern
ment refusing requests or demands for the
same from the grasping powers of Eu
rope With these interests vested in
America the United States would be
obliged to protect the rights of its citizens
and China knows this.
The general plan of organization is to
apportion shares in the company to mer
chants, capitalists and corporations at
various points. This would naturally pre
vent centralization of the company in any
section of the United States, but would j
make the whole nation a party to any In- j
fringement upon the interests and rights ;
held by its citizens in the Orient. It is ]
stated that the project is being advanced j
among other capitalists than those of i
San Francisco. That it is favorably con- I
sidered here is manifest by the meetings !
of some of the prominent business men of :
this community, who at present claim to
be "only discussing and talking over the
subject."
It is certain that Ho- Yow has excited
more than a passing interest, for when- |
ever there is a gathering of this sort men |
representing unlimited capital are to be
found present. So far no results have ob- j
tamed, as the Interested parties state. -
but It is certain that if the project had j
no extraordinary inducements the capital- i
ists would waste but little time with it. !

INSURANCE MEN
FEAR THERE IS
TROUBLE AHEAD
o
Compact Regulations
Violated.
Well defined rumors of possible trouble
in the insurance compact have been caus
ing a great deal of uneasiness among the
fire underwriters. It is all over the old
question of compensation to agents. Some
of the managers claim that the rules of
the union establishing a uniform rate of
commissions are being violated and that
as a result their business is suffering.
Agents are placing their policies where
they can make the most out of them, and
the companies who are .adhering strictly
to the compact rates are unable to hold
their business.
As has been the usual case when the
union was on the verge of disruption the
trouble has started in Oakland. It is
claimed that the offending managers have
been using the plate glass and casualty
companies, that they represent as a side j
line to their regular tire business, through j
which to work extra dollars into their i
agents' pockets for their lire insurance ;
policies.
The casualty and plate glass companies \
are not members of the compact. Agents
who are allowed IS per cent commission i
under union rules have been paid a salary i
as representatives of the casualty com-
E anies. for whom they do practically no !
business. This salary of course is in i
compensation for their five insurance
business and is charged against the cas
ualty companies merely to get around the
compact provisions.
It is claimed that this method has been
employed in Oakland and throughout
Alameda County for some time. Com
plaints have been made to the compact
managers and they have promised to stop j
the practice, but the insurance managers
claim that they either have been unable
to do so or do not desire to be too strin
gent for fear of creating another rate ,
war across the bay.
The managers who have been losing
business are becoming restless and dis- !
satisfied with the condition and are *
threatening to withdraw from the com
pact if existing evils are not remedied.
The underwriters are not discussing the
matter for publication to any great > x
tent. All are willing to admit that trouble
is likely, but assert that they will exert
every effort to prevent a collapse of the
union. Under the rules a member desir
ing to withdraw must give ten days' no
tice of his intention. Statements were
made that Rolla V. Watt. Pacific Coast ;
manager of the Queen Insurance Com
pany, Was one of the dissatisfied ones and !
had concluded to present his resignation j
to the compact. When seen yesterday
afternoon Mr. Watt would not confirm the
rumor. He said:
"There is always trouble in the insur
ance business, the same as there is in any- .
other line. 1 know things are being done
that are not according to rule and to the j
Injury of those who are living up to the
compact agreement. When things reach
the point when they can no longer be
tolerated the only thing to do will be to
step out, but as yet I have not concluded
to hand in mv resignation, and any ru- '
mor to that effect is without foundation."
At any rate insurance circles are un
easy and an outbreak is looked for at al- |
most any day.
Henry George Anniversary.
The preparations for the celebration
of the sixtieth anniversary of Henry
George's birth are nearly c implete. Judge
Crosby of New York City, the orator of
the occasion, is expected to reach this
city on the overland train on Thursday
evening. He will be met on the east side
of the bay by a large delegation of single
taxers and other admirers of the late Mr.
George and escorted to his hotel here.
On Friday evening he is to be the guest

ganization, where there will be speech
making and other interesting exercises.

presided over by Stephen Potter, presi
dent of the local single tax society, with
Mr. Crosby as the speaker of the evening.
This meeting is also to be free to every
body. On Monday evening the distin
guished New York spell-binder will give
the Oakland people a taste of his elo
quence and logic. A few days later he will
proceed south and lecture In Los Angeles.
In the Divorce Court.
Julia H. Allen has been granted a di
vorce from John Allen on the ground of
willful neglect. Decrees of divorce on the
ground of desertion have been granted
Gottleib Schmierer from Josephine
Schmierer and Catherine L. Kruse from

SCHOOL BOARD
TO DEAL WITH
A BIG DEFICIT
June Bills Cannot Be
Liquidated.
The annual report of Superintendent
Webster, which is rapidly nearing com
pletion, will present an interesting array
of School Department figures and fin
ances. It will show to a cent the deficit
left by the last board as an heritage to
the present and will lay before the mer
chant and teacher creditors 'of the depart
ment a concise balance %sheet for the
fiscal year ending June '3o, 1899.
The deficit that faced the board on that
date amounted to $215,182 39. Of this
amount $203,775 10 was handed down by
the last board. The balance, amounting
to $6407 29, represents the unpaid labor
and supply claims of June of this year.
The deficit is made up of unpaid teach
ers' salaries for November and .December
of 1898. amounting to $179,346 90; janitors*
salaries unpaid, $10,054 20; rents unpaid,
$1677; unpaid demands June 30, 1899,
$6407 29; due merchants June 30, lv-'.*.
$23,696 Total. $215,182 39. The unpaid items
for June, 1809, are barred from payment
by a constitutional inhibition which pro
vides thai the liabilities of one fiscal year
may not be paid out of the revenues of
the ensuing fiscal term.
The financial table as it will appear in
the report is as follows:

"RIGOLETTO" AT THE
TIVOLI APPLAUDED
Barron Berthald, Ella Prossnitz and
William Mertens in the Lead-
ing Boles.
"Rlgoletto" being written ln what may
be called the popular vein, attracts, of
THE EMPORIUM.
course, large houses, and the applause is
very frequent and spontaneous. There is
much room for dramatic action, and
hence the trio consisting of Barron Ber-
thald. Mary Linck and Klla Prossnitz has
ample opportunity to display its dramatic
temperament, of which it possesses a con
siderable quantity. To appreciate fully
the excellent rendition of the waltz song
in the last aCt by Mr. Berthald. it should
not be forgotten that this melody has
been played so often that, like the inter-
mezzo from "Cavalleria Rusticana," it
becomes tiresome unless delivered with a
refinement that flatters the educated mus
ical connoisseur. That Mr. Berthald sue-
ceeded in giving an ideal recital of this
dainty bit of composition was manifested
by the vigorous applause accorded him.
Another artist who fulfilled her task
nobly was Miss Ella Prossnitz, whose
resonant dramatic soprano had various
chances to show its strength and fine
training. The feature of the opera, how
ever, was the quartet in the last act. It
was sung with excellent taste, contained
all the fervor which the composer infused
in it. and the tout ensemble was without
' a flaw. The chorus was somewhat ragged
at times, but another performance will
easily remedy this defect. The orchestra
also needs a little more' polish. The
mounting was imbued with that pains-
taking regard to detail that characterizes
all of George Lask's work. Once more at-
I tention is called to the grand quartet in
l the last act, in which Ella Prossnitz,
! Mary Linck. Barron Berthald and Wil
; liam Mertens participated. This evening
i "La Glaconda" will be repeated.

THE CANAL AND THE SHIPPING BILL.
1 .! . .1
SINCE it has become virtually assured that the
Nicaragua canal bill and the bill for the pro-
motion of American shipping will be made ad-
ministration measures at the coming session of Con-
gress, the Bom opposition to them has been more
determined and more active than ever. It is recog
nized the issues can no longer be defeated by dil
atory tactics, and accordingly the opponents of the
two great movements are rallying their forces tor
1 C 1 ' -
the final contest.
The Philadelphia Record denounces both bills as
"dubious schemes for looting the treasury," and pro-
â â â â -â â â  '.* * - i i
ceeds to argue that the commerce of the country Ins
no need for either an isthmian canal or an enlarged
merchant marine. It says: "Statements have been
recently sent by telegraph from Washington setting
forth the value of the west coast trade of South
America, which we must go thousands of miles out
of our way 'around the Horn' to participate in fee-
lack of an isthmian short cut; and also setting forth
..the hundreds of millions of dollars yearly lost tee the
country in freights paid to the ships of other na-
nations which monopolize our foreign carrying
trade. It is intended by such advance statements to
create a favorable public opinion."
Having thus set up as the arguments for the canal
and the shipping bill what it doubtless regarded as a
flimsy cobweb, the Record proceeded to sweep it
airily away. There is no intervening isthmus to in-
terrupt our trade with the Gulf and the Atlantic
ports of South America, it says, and yet we do not
get the bulk of the trade of those ports. It draws
therefrom the conclusion that if our Eastern
States had, through the canal, an open waterway
to the Pacific ports of South America, they would
r.ot be more successful in obtaining trade there.
The statements are unquestionably true. An open
waterway is of no use to commerce unless there be
ships to traverse it. We lose the trade of South
America because our ship-owners cannot compete
with the subsidized ships of European nations. The
shipping bill is therefore as necessary as the canal
bill, but the. Record will not tolerate that self-evident
conclusion from its own statements. It says: "Since
our foreign carrying trade is done so cheaply by for-
eigners that American shippers cannot undertake it
without loss (necessitating the payment of subsidies),
we are benefited, not injured. Our shippers get full
value in the service rendered for all the money it
costs. Why, then, should subsidies br granted in
order to make good .losses to be unnecessarily in-
curred in unprofitable business ventures?"
The answer to that question is that foreigners do
not carry our commerce for us more cheaply than we
could carry it for ourselves, and, moreover, the for-
eign ship-owner and merchant are more intent in de-
veloping the trade of their, own country than in pro-
moting ours. The swift upbuilding of German com-
merce and of German industries by the operation of
subsidized ocean vessels is a striking proof of what
can be effected for the welfare of a nation by that
policy. Before the grant of liberal aid to German
vessels the empire had but a comparatively small for-
eign commerce and was never dreamed of as a rival
to the British. Xow Germany is not only a rival of
Great Britain in the trade of South America, but is
actually competing in the British colonies and in the
Orient, where Great Britain had once almost a
monopoly of the foreign trade.
According to Senator Frye the United States are
now paying to foreigners $100,000 a day for carrying
our commerce. It would surely be better to keep that
money at home. If the Record will study the situa
. tion it will perceive that the canal bill and the ship-
ping bill are something more than administration
measures. They are popular measures. The needs of
the country require them, and the people demand
them.
The official call for the great pow-wow on trusts,
which will soon be held in Chicago, declares the pur
pose of the convention to be "educational." It would
seem that the people of the United States were al
ready "overeducated" on the subject.
LET US HAVE FACTS.
THE Portland Oregonian is the ablest Western
advocate imperialism and militarism. It is a
paper of such ability that it can afford to argue
its case from the substantial and everlasting
basis of truth and facts. It is therefore
more noticeable than in a weaker paper when
it avoids facts and substitutes imagination or
invention. The American people are willing to make
war and continue it at the order of their Government.
They will so continue the war in the Philippines un-
til they as the masters of their own Government
choose to command it to cease the pushing of an ad-
venture after they choose to see in it neither honor
nor profit.
The Oregonian's latest statement of its case is based
on this imaginary foundation: "We did not go *.o
the Philippines for the purpose of dealing with the
insurgents or of helping them to gain their freedom.
We went there to strike at Spain, with whom we were
at war. The insurgents rendered us no real assistance
in the capture of Manila and the expulsion of Spain,
for they were then, as now, too weak and cowardly
to stand and fight. No people that possesses so little
fighting quality can establish or maintain national in-
dependence."
The North China Herald, published in Shanghai, in
its issue of January 16, 1809, prints a lecture given in
that city on January 12 by Hon. John Bar-
rett, who is one of the most active coad
jutors of the Oregonian in advocating im
perialism and the conquest of the Philippines.
In that lecture Mr. Barrett said: "For Aguinaldo and
his supporters I am free to say 1 have some re-
spect and much sympathy. Having known him and
most of his officers well, and watched him during a
li ng period that has elapsed since I saw him put
aboard of a dispatch boat in Hongkong last May, by
permission of Admiral Dewey and Consul General ;
Wildman, for the- direct purpose of going to Cavite to ,
organize an army and temporary government, and :
make war on the Spaniards in co-operation with the
American forces, it is impossible to condemn him
without reserve, as so many have done. He organized
an army out of nothing, which developed into a force
of 30,000 men. armed with modern rifles. He captured
all the Spanish garrisons on Luzon outside Manila,
so that when the Americans were ready to proceed
against that city they were not delayed and troubled
by a country campaign. Moreover, he has organized
a government which has practically administered the
affairs of that island since the American occupation
of Manila, which was certainly better than the former
administration by Spain. He has organized a Cabi-
net and Congress, 2nd has among his advisers men
of acknowledged ability as international lawyers.
while his supporters include most of the prominent
educated and wealthy natives, all of which proves pos- j
sibilities of self-government that we must consider."
An officer in Dewey's fleet writes on January 31 of
this year: "Aguinaldo landed at Cavite on May 20,
1898. He created a native army in a short time and
immediately commenced to win victories. These were
at the time to us astonishing, for he defeated detach--!
ment after detachment of the Spanish army, took fort
after fort, captured regiments with arms and ammu- i
nition, and in a little time he had captured every
Spanish soldier on the island of Luzon, or had driven
those not captured' into Manila. Time and again I
have witnessed whole battalions of Spanish soldiers
marched as prisoners into San Rogue. Before
August 13 these insurgents had actually captured the
whole of Luzon, except Manila, from the Spaniards.
After taking all of Luzon, with the exception named,
they conquered the Spanish, in the island of Negros I
and also in Cebu, and before we reached Iloilo they
had that city and the whole island of Panay, on which
it is situated. These places are, after Luzon, the most
important in the archipelago. More remarkable to
me than Aguinaldo's military actions, which every- .
where have been uniformly and tremendously success

throughout these islands, which now governs and
Miles them, except in Manila and Cavite. I have
visited his government at Malolos, and when meeting
and talking with these well-dressed, courteous people,
with their intelligent faces, the idea that they were
savages passed from my mind forever, and I have
since looked upon them as a people who should be
consulted when their fate and interests are at stake." :
Now either this officer, who wrote from Iloilo only
four days before hostilities began, tells the truth or he
lies. That he tells the truth is known by the Ore- 1
gonian and by everybody else. Why, then, base a
position on the untrue statement made by that paper? j
Why not admit the historical fact of the conquest of
the three islands by the Filipinos, with the unimpor- ;
tant exception of Manila and Cavite?
The American people are not traitors for wanting
facts and not fiction as the basis of their action, and
in the end it will go harder with policies and their
advocates who urge a certain course upon statements
that are not true.

When the Russians sought at the Peace Conference
to protect private property at sea they probably did
not anticipate that Russians would soon be caught
confiscating private property on land. The guns of
a British gunboat on Chinese waters proved eloquent
pleaders the other day for the sanctity of private
rights.
THE LAW'S DELAYS.
THE National Bar Association is in session in
Buffalo. Its president, Mr. Joseph Choate, is
absent at his duty as Embassador to the Court
of St. James.
He sent to the meeting an address, in which he said:
"The law's delays, wdiich seem constantly on the in-
crease, may well engage the earnest attention of the
association, and no opportunity should be lost to
counteract the inevitable tendency to elaborate pro
cedure and unnecessarily multiplied appeals, which
cause a large proportion of these delays."
Mr. Choate has -truck at the root of disorders which
are not only causing a less respect for the body of
the law but are rousing a feeling of discontent with
the courts. In the older States, especially in New
England, the law and the courts are held in the high-
est esteem, because the delays in administering civil
and criminal justice arc less there than in the newer
â --â '---. -. '.â â 
or less organized conditions of junior States.
The appalling increase in mob vengeance and in
horrible lynching! originates in popular impatience
with the slow progress of judicial justice. It is wrong
to attack the courts except as a part of the bar. Courts
must hear appeals. They must entertain an applica
tion for a dilatory -writ,, and. though they promptly '
deny it. an appeal lies from their judgment in denial, |
and the purpose of delay is accomplished. In cases
of homicide the enlargement of the list of pleas in
defense is responsible for the modern slowness of jus
tice, which wears out patience and replaces it with
popular and awful passion, leading to mob violence.
Beginning with the first plea made in an American
court, of temporary or emotional insanity, to escape
: punishment for homicide, which occurred in the case
of the killing of Key by Daniel E. Sickles, there has
grown up an elaborate system for the protection of
THE SAX FE Ay CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST , 30, 189 ft.
murderers, which has crowded our jails with that class
of law-breakers, who, by the mistaken mercy of the
law, survive their victims for years, and in a high per-
centage of cases escape punishment altogether. It is
possible now to get a judicial inquiry running back
to the remote ancestry of a murderer to find an
hereditary tendency to sporadic insanity. In cases, by
no means few, this search for purely imaginary taint
involves the long delay necessary to climb the family
tree in other countries, to find some gibbering and
tongue-chewing relative who is supposed to have
transmitted, from epilepsy or cretinism or atrophy cf
the thyroid gland, a homicidal tendency to a third or
fourth generation. Other means of delay are fur-
nished by the modern practices of the bar. Under
our duality of government, the radix of certain rights
being in the Federal constitution, the habit of going
to the Supreme Court of the United States upon some
constitutional question has more recently become the
means of evading justice to the slayers of men. It
may be said for the great body of the bar that these
devices are most generally resorted to by minor prac
titioners, who are apt to use a celebrated murder
case, that stays long in the newspapers, as a means of
self-advertising. To deal with such parasites of the
profession is the duty of bar associations, and the
inspiration may well come from the National Asso
ciation.
Mob violence is the odium of the United States.
In Europe its frequency and its horrible details have
given rise to a popular belief that we do not live
I under a government of law. Our large and old
! cities have not been exempt from it. A few years
. ago the jail and courthouse in Cincinnati were nearly
' wrecked by a mob which desired to clean out "mur
â  derers' row," filled with slayers who were mocking
; at the gallows. The lynching of the Italians in New
Orleans, and of a negro in Washington City, add to
the impression that there is no law. The Federal
! Government has paid a half million of dollars in the
; last ten years to other Governments as indemnity for
'â  the murder of their subjects by American mobs.
! Lynching has its origin in disrespect for the law.
Wherein those who administer the law are responsible
â â  for this disrespect there must be reform. The next
; step must be the prompt punishment of the mobs
; which break the law by substituting their acts for the
â â  action of the courts.
These are subjects that should enlist the immediate
' attention of the bar in its national, State and local
\ organizations. Members of the judiciary feel keenly
j the position in which they are placed, and will hail
: the reform which will permit a. prompt judicial final-
ity, beyond which there is no appeal nor oppor
tunity for delay in the enforcement of judgment. Of
j course the law intends that a man on trial for his life
i must have ample opportunity for defence. Anything
less than this would be inhuman. He is arraigned
â  with the legal presumption of innocence, and his
j guilt must be proved. But this need not require
i years to do. His opportunity is ample between com-
mitment and preliminary examination and the dcci-
sion of the trial jury. When the case has been re-
viewed on one appeal to the court of last resort his
1 opportunity has been ample, and the rights of so
-1 ciety are entitled to enforcement.
Washington authorities are disposed to allow trade
! concessions in the Philippines to remain as they were
during Spain's dominion. There are several other
things in connection with the islands that Uncle Sam
\ would like to see as they were before the battle of

A QUESTION OF EVIDENCE.
LORD RUSSELL, Chief Justice of Great
Britain, is quoted as having said re-
cently that while he would not under
take to pronounce judgment on the Dreyfus
case or criticize the courts of another nation, yet
so far as he had read it there had been no testimony
against Dreyfus sufficient, when judged by rules of
evidence prevailing in Great Britain, to warrant an
English magistrate in holding him for trial. In other
words, the great mass of testimony taken by the
French courts woi/d be ruled out in British courts
as utterly inadmissible, and that which remained
would be dismissed as inadequate to sustain the
charge.
It is probable a similar declaration would be made
by almost any eminent lawyer in America as well as
in Great Britain who should be asked for his opinion
on the subject. The witnesses who have been heard
during the trial at Rennes have' in almost every case
stated opinions rather than facts. Hardly a single
one of them has testified to any material point in the
case as a matter of his own knowledge. Many of
them have declared they believe Dreyfus to be guilty,
but when cross-questioned it has turned out the be
lief is a so-called "moral conviction" rather than a
conclusion drawn from facts of assured knowledge.
Nearly all the positive evidence in the case sub
mitted by the prosecution has turned out to be either
perjury or forgery. Up to this time no less than
eleven documents involved in the case have been de
nounced as forgeries, and in some instances the
forgers, like Esterhazy and Colonel Henry, have ad
mitted the forgery. In the face of such disclosures
as these it is still permitted under French law for a
man to go upon the witness-stand and swear to his
conviction that Dreyfus is guilty, and to add that the
conviction is based upon- a belief in the authenticity of
these discredited documents.
About the one and onh. argument of the prosecu
tion is that somebody sold the secrets of the French
army and that Dreyfus is the only man who could
have done it. "If Dreyfus be not guilty, then who
is?" That is the question the prosecution asks and
which its witnesses repeat. Evidence such as would
be admissible under American or British law has not
been forthcoming at any stage of the proceedings.

THE CALL'S SOUVENIR EDITION
PRAISED BY THE PRESS
â¢ Woodland .Democrat.
. For the first time on the Pacific Coast the San Francisco - Call utilized the
wireless telegraphy to announce the arival of the transport Sherman, having
on board the First California Volunteers. /The Call's test was probably the
most successful application of wireless telegraphy ever made in the United
States. Lightship No. 70 is anchored outside of the' Golden Gate. Sensitive
Instruments were put aboard of this ship. in charge of a competent electrician.
Like Instruments were put in the basement of the Cliff House. In the sending
station at the lightship was a Ruhmkorff coil, which transmitted the waves from
the electric dynamo* on the lightship. The Morse characters were made by
the opening and closing of an ordinary telegraph key. This charged an aerial
wire which was suspended eighty-two feet in a vertical direction from the top-
mast of the lightship. Electric waves were pulsated through the air and were
received through a coherer from a similar wire suspended from the top of the
Cliff House at the receiving station. This coherer -actuated the Morse relay,
which in turn worked the ink-writing register, making the characters on the
tape. The Call's achievement was a remarkable one. No doubt it cost a big
sum of money, but Mr. Spreckels see-ins determined to spare neither labor nor
expense in his efforts to put The Call in the front rank of journalism.
San Diego Union.
The arrival of the First California volunteers afforded the San Francisco Call
an opportunity to score two remarkabie journalistic triumphs. The first of
these was a souvenir edition which for elegance in design and illustration and
general excellence has never been surpassed. The second was a novelty of en
terprise, which will go on record as one of the great "scoops" of progressive
American journalism. To obtain the first tidings of the expected troopship The
Call had recourse to that latest marvel of nineteenth century invention the
wireless telegraph. The task of employing this new appliance of telegraphy, yet
in its Infancy, involved no little labor and painstaking. The result was a bril
liant success, and The Call was first to announce the coming of the vessel and
the incidents of the voyage. The feat is the more remarkable because this Is
the first time that wireless telegraphy has been employed by a journal to ob-
tain news several hours sooner than it could have been secured by any other
means.
The Call completely wiped out the Examiner by the excellence of its illus
trations of the parade in celebration of the return of California's heroes. The
Examiner attributed Its failure to the breakdown of its press. This is not so
It was the breakdown of its talent. The Call Is absorbing the best artists in
the city, and is rapidly becoming famed for the beauty and merit of its illustra
tions. Willie is beaten at his own game.
The San Francisco Call's souvenir edition in honor of the returning volun
teers was ene of the handsomest, most appropriate and entertaining newspapers
ever published by that or any other newspaper house of the Pacific Coast.

The Call certainly eclipsed all its cotemporaries in its issue of Thursday

The United States cruiser Newark ar
rived from New York yesterday
via the Straits of Magellan. She
stopped at several places for coal,
the last being Acapulco. From
Acapulco she came to port in eight days.
Th-?re has been trouble on the warship
over the coal supply almost from the time
she â¢ left New York. Captain Goodrich
liad one idea is to what the cruiser re
quired and Chief Engineer Moritz had
another. In consequence the supply gave
out while the Newark was in the Straits
of Magellan, and the man-of-war had to
come to an anchor while the steam launch
was sent back to procure a frtsh supply.
At Montevideo the chief engineer told the
captain there was not enough coal In the
bunkers to carry the cruiser through the
straits. The captain thought differently
and a heated argument followed. The
Newark sailed without any more fuel be
ing taken aboard in spite of the engineer's
protest. At Sandy Point the argument
was renewed, hut still no coal was pur
chased. When the Newark reached
Smyth Channel the supply, gave out and
the cruif-er was helpless. Barges laden
with coal from a Chilean cruiser were
towed to her and the bunkers were
partially filled. Over PM cords of wood
were cut and put aboard, after which the
Newark proceeded to Valparaiso.
The Newark was so long getting from
Montevideo to Valparaiso that fears were
entertained for her safety. The Secretary
of the Navy cabled t.e all the South
American ports, but after leaving Sandy
Point all trace of the cruiser was lost.
I'pon her arrival at Valparaiso the facts
of the case came out and the result will
be a coi:rt-martial as soon as the warship
reaches the navy-yard.

A delegation of Chinamen called upon
Coroner Hill yesterday to obtain some
information regarding the death of Chew
Shee, wife of Set Bak Sing. Shee was
found dead. last Friday night strangled
with a rope made of strips of cloth. One
end of the rope was tied around the
woman's neck and the other end to a
partition wall in the woman's room at
No. 1 Waverly place.
The visitors informed the Coroner that
they believed the woman had been the
victim of foul play. They said also that
Set Bak Sing had another wife besides
the deceased, and that he treated her
most cruelly, besides beating her. They
have engaged Attorney J. D. Sullivan to
take charge of the matter. Coroner Hill
referred them to the police.

MRS, PARRY'S
HOT OLD TIME
IN THE SOOTH

She Enjoyed Herself
Shooting Craps.

CALLED HEESELF AN UNSO-
PHISTICATED MAID.
Â»
Spicy Evidence in the Parry Case
Brought Out by the Testimony
of the Sister of the
Deceased.
â¦
Mrs. Parry probably never regretted
that when she started off tp visit at
Menlo she switched her plans and even
without her husband's knowledge went
down to Los Angeles and ultimately found
herself in Arizona.
Mrs. Parry's visit in the capital of the
turbulent Territory was, according to her
own story, one long, blissful dream. From
Tucson she forwarded to her sister-in-law
photographs of her dainty self arrayed in
the severe habiliments custom relegates
tee the sterner sex. On the back of the
pictures she scribbled, of her innocence,
of pleasures past and delights to come.
When she met her sister-in-law after her
return she enthusiastically explained the
merry time she had "shooting craps and
drinking whisky," capping the climax
with a frank, "in fact. I'm drunk now."
All these merry doings of the lady who
wears deep mourning tor the husband for
, whose death she stands charged with
manslaughter were told on the stand
â yesterday by Miss Mamie Parry, sister-
in-law of the defendant and sister of the
deceased.
Besides sending Miss Parry her choice
pictures and letting her into the secrets
of her stay in Arizona, Mrs. Parry also
invited the lady to "go to the hot place."
Mrs. Parry did not word her Invitation In
that way, but the witness took the lib-
erty to "adapt" it and presented it in that
: form to the court.
All this occurred on the day that Mrs
i Parry: returned from the eventful visit to
Tucson. "She called at our home." said
'. Miss Parry', "looking for my brother
Frank. She told me she was at the Pal-
ace Hotel with her maid, laying especial
stress on the maid, and asked me to call
and see her. 1 refused and then she said
1 might go to the hot place."
On the occasion of that visit Mrs. Par-
ry told her sister-in-law that she was In-
toxicated, and the witness believed her.
After the' shooting of her brother Miss
Parry saw the defendant, who explained
to her that the shooting was accidental.
"After the death of my brother." said
Miss Parry. "at May's request, I remained
for two nights with her. She slept sound-
lv through the nights. After the shooting
she was cool and collected, and the only
one who was not at all upset was her
mother, Mrs. Van Valkenberg." Miss Par-
ry was present on the occasion when her
brother's wife asked him to give her a
divorce, and he refused. She heard her
make the statement that she wanted it
and would get it. "She also told me,"
testified Miss Parry, "that Leo Hirsch-
man had offered her *500 if she would
elope with him."
Isaac Parry, father of the deceased,
was recalled by the prosecution and testi
fied that he knew of no disagreement be
tween his son and his wife until Mrs.
i Parry was known, to be in Arizona,
"Frank did not know she was in Tucson,"
said the witness, "until the time of the
I Baldwin lire, when he received a telegram
from her dated from Tucson and Inquir
â  ing whether Frank was hurt."
Mrs. Parry had also heard her ask the
deceased to give her a divorce, and had
beard him refuse. In conclusion Mr. Par
ry testified that he was not satisfied with
his son's deathbed statement that the
shooting was an accident.
Mr*. Parry, mother of the deceased, was
also on the stand, but her examination de
veloped no new facts. To her, as to the
other members of the family, Parry had
, said the shooting was an accident. In ad
-1 dition to this Frank had asked his mother
"to be good to May, and try to make her
! good."
The case will go on this morning at 11.
After the adjournment Mrs. Lyons, sis
ter of Mr. Parry, and Mrs. Van Valken
berg, sister of Miss Parry, had a heated
controversy, and the timely Interference
1 of friends prevented the controversy from
going beyond words.
Photography by Night.
The Wasp of this week ls out already
with twenty pages of halftones of the
volunteers* reception and night proces
-1 sion. The photographs of the night
scenes are very Interesting. This is a
new thing in instantaneous photography,
a branch of the art which apparently has
however made rapid strides. The City
! Hall with its illuminations is accurately
photographed; so also is the ferry build-
ing and Market street with its myriads
'of electric lights. Looking at the Wasp's
i splendid specimens of night photography,
i one wonders what new miracles will soon
â  be performed by the camera.
IMPORTANT DECISION
IN A MARINE CASE
LIABILITY OF OWNEES OF YES-
SELS FOE MASTEES' ACTS.
United States District Judge de Haven
rendered a decision yesterday morning in
the case of Frank Guttner and others of
the crew of the whaler Navarch against
the Pacific Steam Whaling Company. The
action was for damages for marine tres
pass. It is charged that in October, 1897,
"one Leavitt," master of the whaling bark
Newport, owned by the defendant, took
by force from the bark Navarch, then ice
bound in the Arctic Ocean, certain stores
and provisions.
The answer admits the taking of the
property, but denies that the libelants
were lawfully possessed of the property
or that it was taken by force, and for
a separate defense alleges that it was
necessary for the master of the bark
Newport to take the property for the use
of tne crew of the Newport and other
whaling vessels Icebound in the Arctic
Ocean at that time for the preservation
of human life.
Judge de Haven in his opinion says that
the property taken from the Navarch be
longed to the owners elf that vessel. The
libelants, however, were in lawful pos
session of ' the property at the time 'it
was taken and had a right to so continue
in possession as against every one except
the true owner. The possession thus had
was not that of servants merely, but was
sufficient to entitle the libelants to main
tain the action against the defendant,
who had not shown a letter title, if any. I
for the property so taken against their
will. It sufficiently appeared from the
evidence that the' libelants were not will- |
ing to allow the stores on the Navarch to |
be taken from their possession except i
upon receiving a receipt In order that !
the value of the property should be paid j
to the owner. No receipt was given, and
the property was taken without the con
sent of the- libelants.
Judgment was given in favor of the j
libelants for $4.'>o and costs, the value of
the property taken for the Newport. The
defendant was not responsible for prop
erty taken by Leavitt for the other ves
sels, or for acts In no manner connected
with the business to which his agency i
extended.
ESTATES OF THE DEAD.

WHISKY ROBBERS WANTED.
Daring Act of Two Young Men in
Broad Daylight at Greenwich
and Powell Streets.
Victor Monti, the driver of a delivery
wagon for H. Buneman, wholesale liquor
dealer on Front street, swore to a com
plaint in Judge Mogan's court yesterday
for the arrest of two men on the charge
of robbery. , - '*Â*".
He was delivering two demijohns of
whisky, valued at $23, at the saloon of
Dondc'ro & Logamarsino, Greenwich and
Powell streets, Monday afternoon about
4:30 o'clock, when a young man with a
revolver in his hand stepped up to him
and, pointing it at Jiim, ordered him to.
hand over the two demijohns. There was
another young man who appeared to be
a lookout in a wagon.
Being afraid of the revolver, Monti
dropped the two demijohns, which were
promptly picked up by the young man
with the revolver aiid placed in the
wagon. Both men drove off before Monti
could sound an alarm. He says he will
be able to identify the two men.
Another Appeal for Ota.
W. H. L. Barnes appealed to United
States District Judge de Haven yester
day for another writ of habeas corpus on
behalf of- B. Ota. the Japanese who has
been ordered deported by the Immigra
tion Commissioner on the ground that he
is affected with a contagious disease.
The grounds of the application are that
Ota is a resident citizen, that he ls not
diseased and that the action of the local
Commissioner of Immigration was not af
firmed by the Secretary of the Treasury,
the lawful authority, but by some other
person. The writ was granted and made
returnable at 11 o'clock this morning.

EXTRA SESSION
MAY BRING A
NEW CANDIDATE
Major McLaughlin to
Enter the Field.
A SIGNIFICANT DECLARATION
â  â¦ â â
"IF THEY WANT ME FOE SENA-
TOE, I AM BEADY."
An Early Beginning of the Contest
for Congressional Nomination
in the Third Dis
trict.
â¦
Advocates of the extra session seem
to be confident that the members of the
Legislature will be called together early
in November. There is talk that the
Governor will not issue the proclama
tion until Dibble presents a document
containing the pledge of sixty-one leg
islators that the Mexican will receive
their support. The members who are
clamoring to get themselves and their
friends on the State pay roll desire that
a pledge to abide by the decision of the
caucus shall be deemed sufficient for
the calling of the special session, but
right here comes the apprehension at
executive headquarters that a majority
of the caucus may vote for a candidate
other than Burns. The Governor wants
the plain declaration in black and white
that sixty-one members will vote for
the Mexican and sixty-one members
will not sign any such pledge. As far
as can be ascertained Burns has gained
only one vote since the regular session
adjourned. Huber of Pomona is so
persistently claimed as a Burns recruit
that there is a disposition to concede to
the Mexican the gain.
In the next struggle Burns may not
have the support of the chairman of
the Republican State Central Commit
tee. The other night at a table where
liquid refreshment abounded the Maior
spoke as the wine sparkled. This sig
nificant remark is attributed to him:
"If they want me now to enter the con
test for the United States' Senatorshlp.
I am ready to get in." The utterance
implied that he was once solicited to
enter the struggle, but for reasons
known only to himself and a few of his
associates, declined then to participate
in the contest as a principal. When the
remark made by the Major was re
peated to others the question was asked
if he really meant that he would en
ter the Senatorial contest as a rival
of Burns. ,The insiders aver that the
Major meant to declare himself a can
didate if the members of the Legisla
ture wanted to vote for him at the
proposed extra session. The story is
going the rounds uncontradicted that
the Major and Dan have parted com
pany in the field of politics. The cool
ness began at Sacramento when Hervey
Lindley was called in" to patch up a
badly managed Senatorial campaign.
The election for Representative in
Congress will not take place until No
vember of next year, yet the Congress
men in office are already looking after
their fences and the outside aspirants
are planning to break in. In the Third
Congressional District the fight ls al
ready on. Henry P. Dalton is prepar
ing to contest for the nomination with
Victor Metcalf and has rallied to his
support a considerable number of fol
lowers.
There are many aspirants for Con
gressional honors in the Fifth District.
All of them note that Speaker Reed,
who so often braced up Mr. Loud, has
retired from politics for the present.
and fancy that the time is near at
hand for considering the claims of Re
publicans other than the present repre
sentative of the Fifth District.
In local circles, Sheldon G. Kellogg.
chairman of the Republican nominat
ing convention, and Jasper McDonald,
the presiding officer of the Democratic
body of delegates, are engaged in the
work of selecting committees which
they were "authorized by their respect
ive conventions to appoint. The Re
publicans are not exulting over the pro
spects of finding an acceptable can
didate for Mayor and the Democrats
are not boasting of success in finding
the best of material for the Board of
Supervisors.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 29 â Prices in many prom
inent railroad stocks show losses of $1 per
share and upward as a result of the day's
trading. Thera was a disposition in the early
hours of the day to test the decline and the
effort was assisted by several strong features
in the list. But the persistent heaviness of
the railroad stocks and the manifest exhaus
tion of the buying demand discouraged the
bulls and turned the scale in ravor of the bears.
Stocks in which manipulation by pools has
been recently evident showed a conspicuous
lack of support. Conspicuous in this class was
L eulsville and Nashville, Northern Pacifle:,
Atchison preferred. Baltimore and Ohio and
Western l'nion. Several of the minor stocks
'which have been under recent manipulation
also suffered severely. Some opposition to the
early heaviness resulted from the active de
mand for the Republic Steel stocks on the
itrength of yesterday's declaration ot "a dividend
on the preferred stock and semi-official inti
mations of very large earnings available for
the common. The common advanced at one
time 2% and the preferred 4 per cent. Steel
and Wire was also marked up on predictions
that the listing committee of the Stock Ex
change was disposed to admit it to the listed
department. These two factors imparted firm
ness to the iron and steel group with the ex
ception of Tennessee Coal an.! Colorado Fuel.
In the railroad list the Chicago Great Western
stocks showed great strength, the preferred
â¢â ]â  * rising 2 points. There was a demand for
Kansas and Texas preferred and train- showed
by Wheeling and Lake Erie and Hocking Val
ley. In the local traction stocks Brooklyn
Transit was lifted quite aggressively and Met-
Trant * ;v and Met
ropolitan Street Railway and Manhattan
showed sympathy. There came a covering
movement In Tobacco after a sharp fall and
Sugar showed strength from the same cause.
But those elements of strength were quite In
sufficient to induce a renewal of buying In the
general list on nny large scale and prices con
tinued to drift away under dribbling offerings.
The declaration of a 2 per cent semi-annual
dividend on l'nion Pacific preferred stiffened
that stock and caused a momentary check to
the downward movement, but when the bears
perceived the continued heaviness they at
tacked the market In the ate dealings, making
the closing active and weak at about the low
est. The few earlier gains were mostly wiped
nut, those remaining being largely reduced.
The weakness on foreign stock markets on
account of the acuteness of the Transvaal
crisis was an Influential factor In the day's
weakness. London's sales here were estimated
at 30,0i"K) shares, covering the entire list of In
ternational stocks. The fall of a fraction In
the actual rtites for sterling exchange in face
af this liquidation from London caused renewed
uren>=lness over the local money situation, of
wliich It was a reflection. Rates for time
money were appreciably firmer and no call
jo.in^ were made low 3 per cent.
The bond market was rather quiet and price
rlnnges were Irregular. Total sales, par
value. tl. 480.000. ..;â 
United States â¢ Government bonds were un
changed in the bid prices.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Aug. 29.â Weakness was shown by j
wheat at the opening of trading. Liverpool re
ported a decline of %d, while the Northwest
advices told of perfect weather for harvesting
operations, and also said that country wheat
would move freely from now on. Lings were
the principal sellers. They were apparently
afraid of the present favorable crop conditions
and liquidation from that source forced prices
downward slightly from the opening decline.
The break In prices was taken advantage of I
by shorts, who covered quite freely, and a
slow recover^' in prices ensued, the advance
bringing both the September and December op
tions back fairly within yesterday's closing
prices. An interval of extreme dullness fol
lowed and prices for an hour or more varied
but little. The general tendency was in the
main downward, the speculative market being
Influenced to a certain degree by the early slack
cash demand. The wakness became more pro
nounced ln the afternoon, though the declines
were small on account of the lack of trading
either way. The Northwest was weaker than
th.- local market, and some selling came from
tha direction. Late in the session the market
was Influenced by the Hungarian Minister's
estimate on the world's wheat crop, which put
the amount at nearly 90.000,000 bushels under
theoretical requirements. A fair amount of
buying followed this announcement, and the
best prices of the day were reached. There
were practically no holders willing to part
with their wheat at the advance, and the close
found the market steady, but on a slight down
ward turn. Bradst reefs estimated the world's
visible decrease at 1,982,000 bushels, about what
was expected. New York put the export en
gagements at twenty-five loads. September
opened %c lower at 69%'HÂ«9%c. It declined to
69% c during the first hour, sold as high as
70% c, and closed at 70c. December opened %c
to' %c lower, at 71%fi71%c. It declined to 71% c
and reacted to 72%eg72Vic, sing at 72c.
Corn was Irregular. September was weak
early with wheat and on the more liberal
country offerings, but it rallied later and closed
about steady. The new crop futures were
steady all day. Trading was extremely slow
and price fluctuations in all speculative futures
were small. September closed %c lower; De
cember unchanged.
Oats In the main followed corn. Septembei
closed %c lower. December closed a shadt
higher.
Provisions were steady most of the day.
Weakness was shown at the opening on the
sympathy with the grain markets. Shorts were
derate buyers of the September product,
and with light offerings, the price ruling higher
until near the close, the demand slackened and
prices fell off. The close was steady. Septem
ber pork unchanged; lard and ribs. 2%c lower.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. 29.â :
In another week i.eland Stanford Jr. Uni
versity wjll open hor doors for the ninth j
year to students. Within the past year ;
the outlook for the future prosperity of
Stanford has brightened so much, through
the munificent generosity of Mrs. Stan-
ford, who has given practically all her ,
remaining property to the university, and \
through the commencement of the new |
outer Quadrangle and other buildings, that I
the coming year will be a notable one In )
many ways.
In the tirst place, the Incoming class of |
new students promises to be the largest j
ln the history of the university. The Reg- i
istrar of the university estimates that :
there will be fuay 30 per cent more new
students than there were last year,
which will make the total of new students .
over five hundred. The increase in the
number of new students will be in every I
line, post graduate, freshmen and those
with advanced standing. The number of
old students who will return will ala be !
as large as ever., so that the total regis- j
tmtion will probably be between 13)0 and I
1300. One fact that the authorities desire !
* -
to call especial attention to. however, is
that the number of women students who I
desire to enter will not exceed live bun- |
ured, so there will be no necessity to dis-
criminate this year in any case in order
* -
to bring the number within the umit re- I
cently set by Mrs. Stanford.
S
â¢The prosrramme of the opening days i
of the university ia as follows:

HEALTH BOARD ORDERS
DEPARTMENT CHANGES
The Board of Health held its regular
meeting last night and uisposed of a grisi

month. Dr. Lawlor on hog ranches and
ptomaine-stuffed shrimps and a few more
shots at the dollar limit taken by differ-

ent heads of departments were the prin
cipal features of the session.
Dr! Lawlor reported that he had in- :
Lawtor i
spected numerous hog ranches maintained
within the city limits and that in his
judgment they were all nuisances that
should be abated. He suggested that they
be moved outside the county line. The
matter was referred to George A. Knight,

Dr. Lawlor also reported that he had re-

shrimps and action was deferred until
the analysis should be completed.
Dr. Sussdorf. superintendent of the City
and County Hospital, reported that the
female nurses who contracted typhoid
fever at his institution were convalescent.
His report also stated that the hospital
was unusually crowded; there being 393
patients during the present month. The

sanitary condition remains as last re-

A communication from Chief Food In-

"The Business Men's League of St. Louis
versus the Atchison, Topeka and Santa

aver that the railroads discriminate un
justly in favor of S.in Francisco ami other

unreasonable difference between the rates
for carloads of freight and the rates for
less than carloads of freight. They want
the rates adjusted so that the retail man
can go East and buy of them instead of
the San Francisco jobber.
The articles in the complaint are
lengthy and uninteresting. The sixth ar

COLUSA'S OFFICIALS
BEFORE THE EQUALIZERS
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 29.âRepre
sentatives of Colusa County appeared
before the State Board of Equalization
this morning, in answer to a citation
asking them to explain a falling off of
over half a million dollars ln last year's
real estate values. The county was
represented by its Assessor, County
Clerk and full Board of Supervisors.
The explanation made of the decrease
in values was 'hat lands in Colusa had
Long been assessed for more than their
full value, owing to the fear of preced
ing Assessors to appear before the
State board with a reduction. It was
also contended that there had been a
succession of crop failures in Colusa
County and land values had been af
fected thereby.
The period of depression was explain
ed to have commenced in 1593 and it
was claimed that since then there had
been a steady decline of values. As
sessor Hardin contended that' Colusa
County's roll was still 11,500,000 too
high.
Assessor P. O. Eibes, of Glenn
County, who had been cited to explain
a falling off in his roll of 1436.000; stated
it was due to the fact that a large
quantity of land lying along the Butte
County line had heretofore been over
assessed and that this had been reduced
$5 an acre. There had been very little
improvement in his county during the
past year, but the outlook for improve
ments and an Increased roll next year
were good.

NOBLE YOUNG
WIFE DESERTED
BY A SCAMP
. â¦.
Played Traitor to Her!
Dying Mother.
â â
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 29. I
Mrs. Rosa Madden, 17 years old, has j
been deserted by the young husband who
owes to her his liberty. Had it not been j
for the girl's pathetic plea to Judge Smith
three weeks ago Madden would now be
in the City Prison.
Last night Police Officer Kyte met the
little woman, who was seeking her hus- I
band. She told the officer of her predica
ment, and It was discovered iter that
Madden had left Oakland, saying he was
going to Tacoma. Before leaving he had
induced his wife to give him the little
money she possessed and which Â»she had
earned as a domestic in San Francisco
while her husband was detained in
prison.
William Madden, who is a sneakthief
and a dope fiend, has carried out a cruel
deception since the day he met the girl
at her mother's deathbed. About eighteen
months ago the girl's mother, Mr*.
Lewis, died. Prior to her last sickness
Madden, who had been roaming about
the country, made his appearance at the
Lewis home and did general work for his
board and lodging. He assured the dying
woman that he was a reputable young
tradesman and that his home was in
Tacoma, and he had left there to find
work at anything that offered. Before
her death Mrs. Lewis was- so impressed
with Maddens sincerity that she was :
very gratified when the young folks pro
posed marriage. They were wedded Just
before the girl's mother's death.
Rosie Lewis was an Oakland girl, her
father being In th* livery business here
for many years before moving to Sonoma
County t where he prospered and left an
estate valued at $50,000. His death re- ;
vealed a scandal which no one had sus
pected. Many years ago Lewis married
ln the East and had not been divorced ;
when he came to Oakland and married '
Rosie's mother. After his death the
Eastern wife made her appearance, es- I
tablished her claim to the estate and was *
award the property. After this Rosie's :
mother lived in Sonoma County in very :
poor circumstances till she died.
It is Ukelv that Madden will be rear
rested and brought back to Oakland, for '
there are many alleged charges of rob
bery In which he is implicated, and as he
has so thoroughly deceived the court and
his young wife no further leniency will j
be extended to him.

CLEVELAND, Aug. 29.â Rioting and
disorder broke out to-night in con
nection with the strike on the lines
of the big Consolidated street rail
way to-night, and four cars were nearly
demolished, while the crews were com
pelled to flee for their lives. It was only
after determined efforts on the part of
thirty policemen uader Captain Bradley
that order was finally restored.
The first rioting of the evening occurred
on Central avenue, near the Cleveland
and Pittsburg railroad crossing, where an
eastbound car jumped the track, at the
derailing switch. It was about 6 o'clock
and workingmen were returning home
from the factories and mills in the vi
cinity. A mob of several hundred people
soon gathered and the lawless element be
gan to stone the-- car and crew.
Another eastbound car soon arrived at
the crossing and was brought to a stand
still. The motormen and conductors were
pulled from the car and only succeeded in
escaping after passing through a gaunt
let of rocks and stones. The crew of the
first car fared as badly and even worse.
the motorman being badly injured. A
westbound car was also stopped at the
crossing and the crew was nearly mobbed
by the now frantic crowd. The front and
rear vestibules of all the cars were ut
terly demolished, while every window was
broken. They presented a dilapidated ap
pearance when taken to the barns bynhe
wrecking crews.
Later In the evening a mob of about 3wo
gathered at the corner of Central and
Lincoln avenues, which Is a residence

was saved from serious injury by the ar
rival of a detachment of police. It is ex
pected many arrests will follow the out
rages.
ADDITIONAL ARRESTS IN
PRIZE-FIGHTING CASE

RECRUITS ARE BEING
VERY SLOWLY RECEIVED
BOSTON. Aug. 29.â At the Hanover
street recruiting station less than a dozen
men presented themselves to Major Foote
for enlistment in the Forty-sixth. The
new regiment was assigned by Secretary
Root to be recruited in New England for
service in the Philippines, and only two
men were accepted. One of them served
in the Eighth Massachusetts during the
war with Spain. For a usual day of re
cruiting at Hanover street, this is ex
ceptionally poor, and it shows that the
beginning of recruiting for the new regi
ment, though it caused a fairly busy first
day yesterday, is not bringing out any
unusual number of applicants. There will
probably not be any difficulty in filling
the Forty-sixth and the other regiments.
but it will be done at the steady rate that
recruiting has settled down to and not
with the quickness of the Twenty-sixth.
The State camp at South Framing-ham is
now ready to receive recruits, and the
first lot numbered nine men, who left Bos

ANOTHER LITTLE BODY
MANGLED BY A CAR
OAKLAND, Aug. 29.â Esther F. Wahl
stadt, the 3-year-old child of Peter P.
Wahlstadt, residing on Alcatraz avenue.
near Telegraph avenue, is the latest vie- â 
tim to swell the list of those whose lives
have been sacrificed through the stub- i
bornness of a street railway company In
refusing to equip its cars with life-saving
fenders. Shortly after 6:30 o'clock this :
afternoon the child was run over and
killed by a car of the Alcatraz-avenue
branch of the Telegraph-avenue electric
road, running to Lorln station. The
mangled little body was found between
the rails on Alcatraz avenue, near Shat
tuck, by Motorman C. J. Anderaon, who
had charge of the car, on his return trip
from Lorln. and he presumes that the
little one was struck on the previous up
trip, but he claims to be at a loss to
account for the death.
The only passengers on the car at the
time of the discovery of the body were
E. C. Kimble of Adeline station and E.
Matson of Mariposa street. The trio
gathered up the remains, and placing ;
them aboard the car conveyed them to
Cornelius Donovan's saloon, corner of
Alcatraz and Telegraph avenues. There
they were placed on a table in a rear
room, and the Coroner being notified later
he removed them to the Morgue. A hur
ried examination of the body showed that
the child's skull, legs and chest were j
crushed. The inquest will be held to
morrow evening.
Alcatraz avenue for several blocks near
the scene of the occurrence is very sparse
ly settled and how the child on the tracks
could have escaped the motorman's notice
on his up trip is beyond comprehension.
To-night Anderson surrendered himself
at the City Prison, where he was booked
for manslaughter. However, he was im
mediately released on his own recogniz
ance. To a reporter he admitted that on
the up trip or the one previous he had a
front end lady passenger, but he says he
held no conversation with her, for he did |
not know her. "The flrst I knew of the I
accident," said Motorman Anderson, "was
when I was coming from Lorln and I saw i
the dead body on the track about 300 feet j
west of Shattuck avenue. It ls all a mys- i
tery to me. I have looked at my car *
wheels and the board that is used as a
fender, but could find no blood."
It was afterward learned that a little j
brother of the deceased was riding on the !
same car at the time the body was found, j
but he did not recognize the remains as
those of his sister until they were finally j
identified by the grief-stricken father.
The motorman says he had paid the boy** j
fare out of his own pocket. He says. too. I
that near Lorin station he has had great I
difficulty, ln the absence of any conduc- j
tor. in keeping the children from jumping
on and off his car. j

M'LEAN MEN CONTROL
OHIO CONVENTION
District Meeting Breaks Up in a
Free-for-All Fight.
ZANESVILLE. Ohio. Aug. There is
an unusually lage attendance at the
Democratic State convention this year.
The 802 delegates constitute a small part
of the attendance. Clubs in attendance !
in bodies are those from Cincinnati and j
Columbus, the homes of McLean and
Kilbourne.
There is no opposition to a declaration
against Hanna and bossism or the usual
issues. The Chicago platform will be re- ;
affirmed with a strong Indorsement of
Bryan. There is an unusual fight for the
committee on permanent organization, as
the anti-McLean men objected to the Mc-
Lean slate, which Included Congressman
J. A. Norton of Tiffin for permanent
chairman and Hon. Thomas J. Cogan of
Cincinnati for secretary.
The preliminary meetings at 4 pm.
were in some cases much more spirited
than expected and a few continued till
evening. The Kilbourne men contested
every place on/the long lists. The results
show that the McLean men carried four
teen of the twenty-one Congressional dis
tricts to five for the combined opposition,
with the two Cleveland districts con
tested.
At the district meeting General Warner
spoke most bitterly against the McLean
men. After a free-for-all fight thÂ« anti-
McLean men bolted and left the room
bet re this district me 'Ing was concluded.
The McLean men control the contests, the
construction of the platform and every
thing else to-night, as they will the con
vention to-morrow, and are to-night hold
ing the most noisy jollifications.

J. HAMILTON LEWIS
FOR VICE PRESIDENT
Ex-Congressman From Washington
Seriously Considering the Ques
tion of Running.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29.â Friends and
supporters of former Representative
James Hamilton Lewis of Washington are
urging him to become a candidate for the
Vice Presidency in the Democratic con
vention next summer.
Mr. Lewis himself would not be averse
to accepting a place on the ticket, and it
is possible that he may be a candidate.
His friends profess to believe that he
would stand an excellent show of being
selected. They say that in the National
Democratic Convention In Chicago in IM*;
his name was presented by the State of
Washington for Vice President, receiving
the seventeen votes cast by Oregon,
Washington, California and Alabama. He
has become better known to the country
at large- through his eccentric manner and
conspicuous dress. Lewis, Is not regarded
seriously by anybody but himself. He is
so vain that he cannot realize he is a
laughing stock.
OPPOSITION TO PACIFIC MAIL.
PANAMA, Aug. Advices from

Kosmos line of steamers has made the
announcement here that the steamer
Tanls, leaving Hamburg on September 15,

cisco in competition with the Pacific Mall
Steamship Company. \
MINISTER ASSAULTED
BY HIS SON-IN-LAW
FRED CLEAVES' COWARDLY AT-
TACK ON REV. G. MORRIS.
TACK ON REV. G. MORRIS.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 23.â A warrant was
issued this moraine for. the arrest of I
Frederick Cleaves of Napa on a charge j
of battery. Cleaves beat his father-in
law, Rev. George Morris, last evening at !
the latter's heme, 631 Railroad avenue. \
Mr. Morris is an old man and was the
first pastor of the Congregational church j
of this city.
Cleaves, it appears, has not been sup- i
porting his family, consisting of his wife ;
and four children, for more than a year.
By an understanding between himself and
his wife. Cleaves came to Alameda yes- !
terday evening for the purpose of getting !
his .children and taking them to their |
grandfather's ranch, near Napa. He
called at the residence of Mr. Morris yes- |
terday and asked for his children. His !
request was complied with, and he then j
demanded to be allowed to see his wife, ]
but Mrs. Cleaves had expressed a desire
not to see her husband. He attempted
to force his way to her room, but her â¢
father shut the door and locked it. j
Cleaves broke the door open and in his |
â¢rage struck his aged father-in-law sev- ,
eral blows about the face, breaking his
eye glasses and blackening his eyes. Mr.
Morris' face was also badly bruised. Bert I
Morris, a son, happened to come into the
house at this time and interfered in his
father's behalf. Cleaves then left, taking '
the children with him. He seemed much .
amused over what he had done, and
laughed as he walked out of the yard.
This morning Mr. Morris appeared before
City Recorder St. Sure and swore to a
complaint charging Cleaves with battery.
A warrant was issued and given to Con
stable Wahmuth to serve. Cleaves had |
already disappeared, and it is presumed
went to Napa.
Cleaves is a prominent worker in the
Christian Endeavorers and Boys' Brigade.
He was formerly captain of one of the
Alameda Boys' Brigade companies, and
took an active part in religious work in I
Alameda, Oakland and Berkeley, and his
character was considered- beyond re
proach. Cleaves married Miss Kate Mor- '
ris ten years ago. He was a good pro- ',
vider for his family until about three
years ago. when, it Is said, the majority !
of his salary found its way into the book
makers' hands at the racetrack. Several '
months ago the Sheriff took possession of
the furniture and household goods to sat
isfy a judgment of a San Francisco furni
ture house. Mrs Cleaves was left in desti
tute circumstances and was compelled te ,
go with her children to her father, who
was then living at Santa Cataline. Lat-^r ;
on Cleaves wrote to his wife that he hud
secured a judgment against the furniture
house and had been awarded $700 dam
ages, but as he failed to send her any of
the money to return to him, or in anyway
to provide for his children, Mrs. Cleaves
wrote to her husband and told him he
would either have to provide for the chil
dren or take them and care for them '
himself. He consented to take the chil
dren, and Mrs. Cleaves came to Alameda
to turn the children over to her husband.
Rev. George Morris is over 70 years of
age. He is the father of Justice of the
Peace Henry T. Morris and of George I
Morris, the grocer. Mr. Morris is a pio- j
neer minister and is at present in charge]
of the Congregational mission at the West j
End. The residents of the West End are j
very much wrought up over Cleaves' cow
ardly attack upon the aged minister, who
Is held in high -esteem by every one of I
them. Cleaves is in Napa and has not yet j
been arrested. J

In speaking of the discoveries over at
Cape Nome. Mr. Campbell declared
them to be wonderfully rich. It is the
sea beach that is being worked, and in
some instances men make as high as
$250 a day. This, however, i.- a dread

one-third died, said Mr. Campbell, and
the survivors are being brought out

ernment's expense.

TRANSPORT GRANT BRINGS HOME
WAR-WORN HEROES OF THREE STATES
Five Deaths on the Way Over and a Smallpox Scare at Yokohama.
The Transport Brings a Clean Bill of Health.
Â£==**= transport Grant slipped ln
through the heads last night about
half-past 10 o'clock and anchored
Jl off the barge offlce to await quar
antine inspection. She has on board
30 officers and 516 men of the First North
Dakota Infantry. 23 officers and 453 men
of the First Idaho Infantry, 12 officers
and 213 men of the First Wyoming In
fantry, 2 officers and 57 men of Battery A,
Wyoming Light Artillery; 8 officers and
84 discharged soldiers. 7 naval prisoners,
2 naval hospital patients and 4 civilian
passengers. Among the passengers was
E. Elsworth Carey of the Freedom Pub
lishing Company, Manila. Mr. Carey had
a description of the voyage written for
the papers and ready to be thrown over to
th. reporters when they went out to the
transport last night.
The Grant had a pleasant run over and
the health of the men has been materially
improved by the sea voyage. The Grant
left Manila July 31; August 5 she arrived
at Nagasaki and commenced coaling im
mediately; August 8 she left Nagasaki and
on August 11 she arrived at Yokohama.
She left Yokohama August 14.
There were live deaths on board from
the time the transport left Manila.
August "- Sergeant Benjamin Moore. Com
pany H. Wyoming Infantry, died of
dysentery; he was buried at sea. On the
night of August 3, Hospital Steward Fred
erick Durham, an insane patient, eluded
his guards and jumped overboard. A boat
was lowered and a search was made for
him, but he was not seen again. Cor-
.*:-.: 7 y: Ll
poral Thomas Olson, Company F, Wyom
ing Infantry, died on board at Nagasaki.
He was buried at Nagasaki. On August
13 a fireman named Robert Satall died.
He was burled at sea. Corporal David
Harrold, Company K. North Dakota In
fantry, died while on the v/ay here from
Yokohama. His body is now on board.
So far as the voyage was concerned
there was little of incident besides a
smallpox scare, which developed just be
fore-the transport reached Yokohama. As
6oon as the vessel arrived at Yokohama
she was ordered into quarantine and all
hands were put ashore until she had been
fumigated. The ship was released next
day and returned to Yokohama. She left
for this port 'he same afternoon witH a
clean bill of health.
When opposite Kobe some of the of
ficers and the pilot wished to land and
make thir way to Yokohama overland,
but the health authorities would not al
low any one to come ashore until all
hands had been examined, and as that
would take too long the captain could
not wait.
The Grant came home by the northern
route. She encountered some â  fogs and
considerable cold weather, but none of it
was very severe, and the whole trip was
a pleasant one. At Yokohama a Mr.
Coakley, a passenger. Captain Clark of
the Wyoming Light Artillery, two en
gineers and a refrigerator engineer and
an oiler from the crew were left behind.
The transport will be examined by the
Federal quarantine officials this morning,
and by 0 o'clock, if nothing is found to
delay her, she will be ready to dock. In
that case the men will have time to leave
the ship and reach camp in plenty of time
to make themselves comfortable for the
night.
None of the delegations from the East
now here to welcome the troops went out
to the transport last right, but they will
board her as soon as she been passed by
the quarantine officers. Counting her
crew of 156, the Grant has on board 1619
people.
GREAT RECORDS OF THE
RETURNING VOLUNTEERS
The gallant men from the mountains
and plains of Idaho, North Dakota and
Wyoming, who sailed from these shores
a little over a year ago, are home again.
and like those who have preceded them
and those who are yet to follow they
come with a record of "every duty well
done and every honor well won," but not
BOYS OF THE
BOSTON TO BE
ENTERTAINED
A Theater Party in
Their Honor.
The California boys and the officers and
crew of the cruiser Boston will be enter
tained this evening at a theater party
arranged for them by the citizens' exec
utive committee. The electrical illumina
tion of Market street, tin- ferry tower and
the dome of the City Hall will be re
peated in their honor.
The plans of the committee were some
what upset by the announcement that the
Boston had been ordered to Mare Island.
Mayor Phelan kept the wires hot between
this city and the Navy Department at
Washington in an endeavor to have the
execution of the order delayed until
Thursday morning.
Captain Hughes and Lieutenant-Com
mander Allen visited the executive com
mittee yesterday morning and extended
their thanks for the invitation and ex
pressed regret that the cruiser had been
ordered to leave for Mare Island at 2
o'clock. General de Young suggested
that un hour be consumed in weighing
anchor so that the cruiser would be held
until 3 o'clock, which would enable the
committee to receive an answer to their
message to the Navy Department. Cap
tain Hughes laughingly replied that
things were not done in that way on the
Boston, and that if the orders were to
Bail at 2 o'clock the cruiser would sail
or sink in the attempt.
She got away at 2:30 o'clock and ten
minutes later the Navy Department wired
instructions to the commander to delay
departure until Thursday morning. The
Washington dispatch was delivered to
Commander Hughes immediately upon
his arrival at the navy yard and he de
cided to bring the cruiser back to San
Francisco early this morning.
The blue Jackets and marines, escort
ed by the whole or part of the First Cali
fornia Regiment, will march up Market
street, starting from the ferry at 7:30
this evening. They will be entertained at
the Grand Opera-house, the Orpheum and
without having paid the full price of
blood at which glory must be purchased.
The three organizations numbered only
some 1600 men in all, none being more
than eight companies, yet they contrib
uted their full proportion to the roll of
honored dead and to the full list of battle
scarred heroes. Forty-six of their num
ber lulled in action or dead of wounds and
disease found graves in the far-off Philip
pines. Forty-five others bear wounds
more or less severe.
Arriving at Manila too late to partici
pate in the fighting Incident and the in
vestment and capture of the city from the
Spaniards, they received their baptism of
lire in the breaking out of the Filipino
trouble February 6, and from that time
on to the end of the campaign they were
v. Tvs on duty, either fighting at the
front", guarding the all-important pump
ing station and lines about the city or
doing provost duty within its walls. In
any case alike exposed to the ball or knife
of the wily and treacherous foe, and the
Llmost equally fatal pestilential fever and
the wasting dysentry. incident to the cli
mate and surroundings in which they had
to live.
In no other organizations engaged In
the whole Luzon campaign has the pro
portion of the killed to the wounded been
so great as in these commands. In the
lighting of the sth and Gth of February
the Wyoming Battalion lost two killed
and one wounded, its total being nine
dead and but fcur wounded.
The North Dakotaa had a total of six
teen deaths, with but seven wounded, los
ing in the bloody, tight of April 12 four
killed and four wounded.
The Idaho battalions, numbering 700
men in all. have a death list -if twenty
one, with thirty-four wounded. They
were with the First California in King's
brigade when the fighting began, and on
February 5 and 6. between Paco, Santa
Ana and San Pedro Macati, they lost
seven killed and twenty-five wounded,
the Columbia. The Boston's crew and
500 of the Californians will go to the
Grand Opera-house, where boxes will be
reserved for the cruiser's officers. At the
Orpheum Colonel Duboce, the officers of
the California Regiment and the execu
tive committee will occupy boxes. Five
hundred members of the regiment will lee
cared for at this playhouse. The heavy
artillery will attend the Columbia, where
boxes will be set apart for the officers.
The executive committee expects to be
engaged for the next week auditing tie
bills of the celebration. No figures as
to the actual expenditure have yet been
compiled. Many of the sub-committees
'nave not made their final reports, and it
is impossible to do more than roughly es
timate the outlay. It is the general im
pression that the total amount expended
will not exceed $25,000. At the meeting
held yesterday morning in the office of
Mayor Phelan a vote of thanks was ex
tended to Chief Lees, the police force aid
the members of the Fire Department for
the efficiency with which they handled
the crowd on the night of the big parade
and for the able manner in which they
cleared the streets along the line of
march.
Money is still flowing into the coffers
of the finance committee. The total of the
fund has reached $62,704 71. Yesterday the
Harbor Commissioners made their ' re
turns on the bay excursion and handed
the treasurer $1800 71, representing the net
balance after deducting all expenses.
Other additions to the fund were: Claus
Spreckels. $150; United States Courts and
Marshal, $46; Abner Doble & Co.. $10; Cal
ifornia Powder Works.' s2so; Giant Pow
der Works, $100; Judson Dynamite and

Services In memory of the dead soldiers
of the California regiments will be held
next Sunday afternoon at the Alhambra
Theater, beginning at 2:30 o'clock. The
affair has been arranged by Mrs. Grace
R. Moore, who has had the assistance of
the Red Cross ladies and the support of
the citizens' executive committee.
An appropriate programme of consider
able length has been arranged. Brief re
marks will be made by Rev. George Ad

The theater will be handsomely deco
rated. Ladles who are noted for their
educational, phllanthroplcal and patriotic
work will occupy places on the platform.
It is desired by the committee of ar
rangements that the relatives of the de
ceased soldiers call at the Red Cross head

to receive the Tennessee troops upon their
arrival from the- Philippines. They have
written to George A. Newhall to have

turned their letter over to the- local Keel
Cross Society, and it referred the com
munication to the citizens' executive com
mit. â¢â . No action has been taken in the
matter, but it is likely that the Tennessee
delegation will be allowed to make them
selves at home in the Union Square tent.

WORK FOLLOWS
PLEASURE FOR
CALIFORNIS
â¢
Getting Down to Camp
Routine.
The California men have settled down to
business. The officers have had their work
outlined, and yesterday the process of
mustering out was started in earnest.
With the other commands the work took
three weeks, but they had no outside In
fluences to delay them. It is the intention,
however, not to allow social affairs to In
terfere with the California men, but even
with that good intention it is hardly prob
able the work can be carried on as rapidly
as other regiments have 'done it.
There has been no special camp routine
established so far, for Colonel Duboce has
had other troubles, but to-day a routine
will be made out and posted. So far, too,
there has not been an officers' mess. The
officers, except those on guard duty, have
been resigned to stay in camp only from
9 in the morning until 4 in the' afternoon,
and they have been getting breakfast and
dinner at home, and lunch just outside of
the reservation.- This plan may be con
tinued if it be found that the officers can
attend to their duties under it. Otherwise
a mess will be established and the oflicers
will have to live in camp.
Orders have been received from General
Shafter directing Colonel Duboce and Ma
jor Rice to hold their command in readi
ness to escort the men coming in on the
Grant from the wharf to the Presidio.
Colonel Duboce is going to request the
privilege of also escorting the Minnesota
men when they come in. The calirornia
men were treated most cordially by the
Minnesota men when they met in Manila,
and the regiment wishes to show the Min
nesota men what courtesy it can.
A communication from the Registrar nas
been posted on the regimental order
board. It reminds the men of the regi
ment that registration for the election to
be held ' November 7 is now being carried
on, and that all who were citizens when
they left here and who can register from
some place where they will be living for
