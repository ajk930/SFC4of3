â Dwlght I>. Moody. the famous
cvaiiKollst. died nt noon to-day.
It was not ex|>eeted until yester
day by the mrmtiors of Mr.
Moody's family and his Intimate
drcla of friends that death would be the :
result of his lllneÂ»s. The trouble was a
Â»â¢â¢ :,Â«-iÂ«i rr~Â«lc!nir Mwn. due to overwork.
Mr. Moody* heart had been weak for a ,
l<mg time, and exertions put forth in con
nection with meotinKS In the West last '
month brought on a collapse. fro:n which i
he failed to rally.' The .ev.-ipgelist broke
down In Knnsns City.' Mo., when* he was
holding wvIOCJ nt>out a month ago. and
the i-eriouynoss of hi* condition was so j
apparent to the physician* \ who were
called to attend him that' thfjr'iq reed him ;
in abanUua hit tour -.-- r.-t'vrn to â hla
hme with nil possible speed. After he
reached Northticld eminent physicians
were, consulted and everything; .done to
prolong life. A bulletin Issued last week
communicated the tidings to ; the public
that Mr. Moody was very til. but that a
little Impn/vemcnt was noticed. This week
the patient showed a steady gain until j
yesterday, when he displayed symptoms
of nervousness, accompanied by weak
ness: which caused the family much anxl
â  Â«â  t
Â« '.y.
This morning the weakness continued,
and at & o'clock Mr. Moody called his wife
Â«nd children, telling them that the end
wa.i not far off. The family remained '
close by the bedside all the forenoon. The i
evangelist was almost free from pain. a.nd
occasionally he talked with apparent ease.
Just before 12 o'clock the watchers saw
that tho end was approaching, and at
noon the great preacher passed away.
Ju?t before death came Mr. Moody
awoke as 11 from slumber and said with
much Joyousnest:
"I Bee earth receding: heaven Is open
ing; God Jp calllnu to me." A momrnt
lat"T he expired.
During the night Mr. Moody ad a num. '
Â»>cr of ninklng spalls. He was. however,
kindness Itself to these about him. At 2 i
c.Vlock this morning Dr. N. 1\ Wood, the j
family physician, who spent the night at |
the home* waÂ» called at the request of j
Mr. Moody. The patient was prrpplrlr.if. |
find he request eÂ«l his son-in-law, A. I*, i
Kltt. who spent the first of the night with i
him. to call the physician that he might'
note the symptoms. Dr. Wood adminis
tered a hypodermic injection of strychnia.
This caused the heart to perform its dv- j
tIM more regularly.' and Mr. Moody him
eclf requested his son-in-law. Mr. Flit,
er.d Dr. Wood to retire. Mr. Moody's eld
est son. Will U. Moody, who had been
rlceplng the first of the night, spent the
lart half with his father. .
At 7:20 this morning Dr. Wood was
called, and when he reached Mr. Moody's
room found his patient in a scml-con
pcious condition. When Mr. Moofly recov
Â«r.d consciousness he asked, with all his
old vivacity:; :
"What's the matter; % hit's going on
J. -re'.'"
Some member of the family replied:
"Father, you have not been well, so we
came to we you.'!.*
A little later he said to his boys: "I
have always !Â«en an ambitious manâ not
ambitious to lay up wealth, but to leave
you work to do."
In substance. Mr. Moody urged his two
I.ovk and his son-in-law. Mr. Fltt. to see
that the schools at East Northfleld. Nt
Mount Hernum and the Chhago Institute
Â»^iould receive th< Ir best care. This they
njÃur'd Mr. Moody that they would do.
luring the forenoon Mr*. A. P. Pitt, ms
U:iUKhter. mid to Mr. Moody:
t "Father, we cannot ypnre you."
Mr Moody'P reply was: "I am not Â«o
li-.C to throw my life away. If God has
more work for me to do I'll not die."
The, arrangements for the funeral have
not an yet been fully completed, but the

ruary 5, 15.17. He was brought up on a
farm until ho was lfi years of ape, when
he left home and went to Boston, where

a clerk in a large wholesale shoe store
1 In Chicago and soon became one of- the
I most successful salesmen In the place.
I While thus engaged be spent his evenlt'gs
in mlr-Flonary work among the lowly and
destitute of the city. This work grew to
such proportions under his earnest and
energetic management that he was in
dued ta give up his prolltable business
engagements and to devote all his time
to religious work in connection with the
local Youns Men's Christian Association,
of which he became president. He soon
became known as one of â¢ the most ac
ceptable public speakers of the â¢ '-try.
and was in constant demand at Chnst'an
conventions throughout the West and
South.
During the war ho joined the work of
the Christian Commission and spent much
of his time in looking after the sick and
wounded of both arm At tho close of
the war he returned to Chicago and re
sumed his work there, soon having- a large
and flourishing independent church as 'ho
result of his labors among the people.'
This church is now one of the largest and
most prosperous In the city, presided over
by a regular pastor and still' known to
the public as "Moody's Church." lie
never became a regularly ordained min
ister.
After the great fire of IS7I. which de

It Is considered possible that the Boers'
been compelled, to assume the o f
fensive, the commander having arranged
ror the disposition of the forces and an
ticipating difficulty in maintaining tepd
supplies In the present positions. Moreover
it Is said thai there is a growing desire
among the Free Staters to return home
which is testified to on many sides Â:,,;

Of the Boer ' "inmander. '
In spit.- of the delay of General Methuen
!n advancing, he is regarded as lurK< ly
the master of the situation, and his en
trenched position j s believed to be unas
â¢. In the event of the Boers at
tacking Klmberley, General Methuen
would be enabled to make a counter move
with his artillery nnd cavalry. Conse
quently such a move on the part of the
i. Is not contemplated. It
la apparent, therefore, that to make haste
slowly is the truest policy at present in

tum, the army should not advance faster

HOTELS, MONASTERY AND VILLAS
CARRIED INTO THE SEA.
Amalfi, the Tourist Resort on the Gulf of Salerno, the
Scene of a Fearful Disaster and Heavy
Loss of Life,
ROME, Dec. 22. â A terrible disaster took place this afternoon at Amalfi, the popular tourist
resort on the Gulf of Salerno. About 2 o'clock an enormous rock, upon which stood the
Cappuchini Hotel, slid bodily into the sea with a deafening roar and without a moment's
warning, carrying with it the hotel, the old Capuchin monastery below, the Hotel Santa Caterina
and several villas.
Many people were buried in the debris, which crushed four vessels to the bottom of the sea,
destroying their crews. The mass of earth which slipped was about 50,000 cubic yards.
The population is in a state of terror, fearing fresh calamities. Troops have arrived upon
the scene and have begun rescue work. It is believed that the loss of life is heavy, including a
number of monks and the occupants of the hotel. As yet it is impossible to ascertain the exact
number.
Amalfi is a small but lively town of 7000 inhabitants, situated at the entrance of a deep
ravine, surrounded by imposing mountains and rocks of the most picturesque forms. The Capu
chin monastery was founded in 12 12 by Cardinal Fietro Capuano for the Cistercians, but came into
possession of the Capuchins in 1583. The building, which stood in the hollow of the great rock
that rose abruptly from the sea to a height of 230 feet, contained fine cloisters.

the river in the form of a crescent. Our camp lies midway between the two horns.
The Boers have prepared against our advance in every direction. It may be
true that they numbered 20,000, or three times our strength, at Magersfon

their guns do not carry far enough to do damage. There is little fear rhat the

"The struggle between the British and

there will be t*-rlous encounters before it

"As to the tactics of the contending
armies, both KÂ«-ein to be pursuing what Is
termed 'open order' methods. It is a mis
take to compare the tactics of the Doers
to those of our Indians. Their tactics are
the white man's tactics.
"The outcome, of course, depends upon,
tbÂ« skill of the commanders, as it does

WITCHCRAFT SCHOOL IN PARIS.
A school of a very curious order Is to
be opened in Paris. Its founders offer
to Initiate whoever Is possessed of the
necessary dose of patlenco, and perhaps
of credulity. Into the mysteries of occultf
Ism into the arcana of black magic. There
are persons, thoy opine. svefl In these lat
ter and skeptical days, who would like to
follow in the footsteps of a Paracelsus or
a Trismeglstus, and for the benefit of
these Inquiring souls they have started a
complete course of sorcery and witch
craft, of astrology and the other hetnetlc
"sciences." â¢
An Inscription on the wall of the occult
ist school, 4 Hue de Savol. sets forth that
"the initiated. In virtue of the powers
transmitted them by the masters, reign In
heaven, command on earth and are. feared
In hades."
The programme of studies at the occult
ist school, which has thoughtfully been
forwarded to me. Rives full details of the
three years' course. During the ilrst year
the student Is made to acquire as much
Hebrew "as will enable him to understand
the books of the old alchemists." He be
gins, too. the study "of the constitution
of man and of his hidden forces,"
In the second year he dips Into Sanscrit,
exercises himself In hypnotism and som
nambulism, takes a close look at spirit
phenomena,' and learns, doubtless with
growing Interest and profit, "the prac
tical adaptations of the various arts of
divination."
Finally. In his third year, he studies
"the action of human thought on the In
visible," and many other obscure matters,
his comprehension of which Is aided. It
may be presumed, by his previous train
ing. These successive stages accora-
Flished. It is his own fault If he In not a

â¢ Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA. Dec. 22.â Sixty-five persons
were present at the farewell banquet ten
dered to General Brooke to-day at the
Paris restaurant. General Mario Meno
cal presided and Ernest Lee Conant acted
as toastmaater Benor Ltorente, in pro
posing the health of General Brooke, said:
"General Brooke was called upon to gov
ern Cuba under the extremely difficult !
conditions of transition from the old. nar- ',
row system to the new. liberal regime: '
and he did so without Injuring the rights â 
of any one. Cubans will always remem- i
ber him with gratitude and love."
Major General Wood, who spoke briefly
in response to words of welcome, said:
"The United States is In Cuba in the |
person of representatives who Intend to }
carry out a great work and to fulfill '
Strictly tho promises of the United Stale* j
Congress. as for myself. 1 can only do !
what the. President has sent me to do, i
but I hope to enjoy the esteem and con- ,
ndence of the Cuban people aÂ«Â» General
Brooke has enjoyed them. i
General Ludlow said: Those American I
officials who rÂ«muir. behind may count
themselves fortunate if. when the lime
comes for them to leave the Island, they i
ere followed by the sped and good j
wishes of those whom they In turn leave I
behind us General Brooke it> about to do.
Tii- Cubans have had no better friends
than the American otlicers.
General Brooke, responding said In part:
"I shall always remember the long
hours of toil In Cuba, but I shall ever
recall the kindness shown me by all Cv- j
t:>. esmeciaHy those who realize that i
the Americans are their best friends."
General Brooke will leave to-morrow for
Tampa. a rquadrcn of the Seventh Cav
alry and a battery â â¢( the Second Artillery,
with a band, will escort him from the
palace to the wharf. A major general's*
salute will lie Bred from Babanas as the *
steamer leave* the harbor at 3 o'clock. A
governor general** salute will be tired in i
honor Of General Wood.
The Patrla fays: "Cubans were former
ly accustomed to say thai the autonomists
forfeited all right to be called Cubans by
the shameless way in which they abused
their short term of ottice giving all the
good billets to their own kinsmen and
friends. But, after the shameful way In I
which the first revolutionary government
has wound up its term of office, having
made and given all the billets It could to
Its own friends. Cubans are forced to real
ize that Spanish corruption, ha* contam
inated the neart of the present generation.
We must look to the schoolmaster to build
up a generation of honest citizens."
At to-day's mooting of the Municipal
Council, a motional was made to send an
address of thanks to Presldenet McKinley
for his candid references to the Cuban
people and the future of Cuba In his re
cent message to Congress. The motion
was rejected on the groundâ as asserted
by the principal speaker in oppositionâ
that the message contained nothing new.
but merely reiterated a former promise.

Stage Heroes Are Scarce.
"The making of aetrMMg Is pa.Â«!cr than
the making of acton." writes Frankltn
FylÂ«Â»Â« of "The Theater and Its People,"
in the December Ladles' Home Journal.
"The youns: women nre by nature more
apt and pliable. Their faces it- more
mobile, their manner* more fcraceful. their
habits of speech and bearing more vari
able. When the round-up of talent comes
ami thÂ«Â» graduates are turn.-l out for pro
fessional service there are half a dozen
proficient actresses to every actor of equal
ability. This Is shown at the matlne*
trial performances. In which the female
roles are generally well played, while thÂ«
male ones are not. If promising nctresse*
are more numerous, six to one. than act
ors, the same ratio operates In favor of
the young men In getting work. A good
looking fellow finds himself In no Â»uch
glutted market as discourages hi* sl.Â«trr
aspirant. If he la clever he will rendily
got an opening, â¢â¢v.-ii though he Is ugly.
The masculine roles In plays predominate
largely. Of comely, intelligent and toler
ably facile actresses the supply la far In
excess of the demand. Heroes are scarce.

rut In the morning hours visiting various
*Â» rtl Â°V he clty and cslliac Â»pon one an
other. A large number visited Alum Rock
i ark and enjoyed the (scenery and bath
ing there.
The afternoon was devoted to broncho
rifling and sports at Agricultural Park
.m.rfâ¢ 111^ consisted of exhibitions
Â»Ith the la*so. dismounting while riding
At full speed, picking articles from the
ground while riding swiftly by. broncho
riding and the riding of bulls. Rome fif
teen or twenty vaqucros participated and
the .port was quite lively, although some
of the bronchos seemed bewildered by
their surroundings and refused to buck.
A thrilling episode occurred during the
afternoon, when Britt Grewell. a. one
.egged man. but known throughout the
State, as aji exceptionally expert rider,
was. at his own request, given a notedly
vicious horse. The animal made fifteen
or twenty terrific Jure:- and then stopped
In a fit of the sulks. Or. well swung him
â elf down to one vide and. supporting
hlmrelf by one foot in the stirrup and
his left hand on the horn of the saddle,
kicked the animal in the flank with bis
timber leg. The horse wheeled violently
and et once resumed vigorous buck .rig,
nd before the rider could resume the
saddle he was shaken off. As he lay pros
trate the horse charged on him twice,
striking at him with his fro: feet and
narrowly missed his face each time." The
animal then reared and kicked, striking
Grewell on the nose, but he had miscal
culated the distance, so that but .little
force was in the Mow and no great dam
age was done. He remounted and fully
subdued the animal. The bullock riding
was rather lame. Â«'xce]Â«t when the beasts
several times charged through the crowd
in their efforts to escape.
At the various headquarters there was
an unusually large number of callers. The
hon.dquart<TS of the Santa Clara County
l*loneÂ«TÃ waa an especially busy place. It
was a sort of last grand reunion of the
men who were Instrumental in building
up the Sxate. Several hundred came and
went during the day. A number of the
visitors went heme during the afternoon,
and theft* had called to Bay good-by and
thank the local Pioneers for their hos
pitality.
At the two courtrooms in the Court
house presided over by the ladies' recep
tion committee there was music, dancing
and light refreshment?. The polite society
of the city received the grizzled old pio
neers, and many of them were induced
to danc* with the young buds.

The little cliild is safe from ordinary
dangers in the care of the faithful dog.
Bnt neither the dog's fidelity, nor the
mother': love can guard a child from
those invisible foes that lurk in air,
xrater and foed â the germs of disease.
Children need to be specially watched
and cared for. When there is loss of
appetite, lassitude and libtlessncss in a
child, an attempt should be made to re-
vive the appetite and rally the spirits. In
Dr. Pierre's Golden Medical Discovery
parents have found an invaluable medi-
cine for children. Its purely vegetable
character and absolute freedom from
alcohol and narcotics commend it to
every thoughtful person. It is pleasant
to the taste, unlike the foul oils and
their emulsions offered for children's
use. * Golden Medical Discovery " makes
pure blood and sound flesh, and abso-
lutely eliminates from the system the
poisons which feed disease. K'^f)

AT PACIFIC GROVE
Petition for New Rules
in Circulation.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
PACIFIC GROVE. Dec. 22â Much ex
citement is being caused In th.s town
over the circulation among the property
owners of a petition the object of which
Is to remove c*rt:un restriction* that
placed upon this resort when iho commu
nity was lir^i organized, nearly twenty
years ago. The petition is addressed to
the Paclrtc Improvement Company and to
the Board of Trustees of Pacltic Grove
and prays that ail restrictions txcept lh*t
of liquor s< Ulnsj be removed. Two im
portant items are the allowing of busi
ness houses en other than the threr or
four blocks now designated without the
payment ol the present virtually prohibi
tory royalty, and the allowing of dra
matic entertainments and dances and
other forms of amusement at the betels
or elsewhere inside tho city limits.
The petition M ts forth very ilistinctly,
however, that no alleviation of the jir. â â --
ent stringent law â piÂ«^ the selling of
Intoxicating liquors is desired and on the
other hand th<> signers would Indorse
greater strictures if that were possible
Tho petition has been in circulation for
the pant week and so far has met with
only two refusals. Among its blgners are
many of the best people of the town.
While there Is great opposition to the
movement among some of the townspeo
ple It Is confidently asserted that were
the question placed before the voter* of
the town it would be carried by a large
majority. Great interest is felt by tlie
entire town as to the fate of the petition
when placed before those to whom It is
addressed.
The Pacific Grove Retreat, as this town
was originally called, was organized some
twenty years ago under the auspices of
the California Conference of the M. Ei.
Church and was designed as a meeting
place for religious conventions. It was
then little more than a camping ground
with a convention hall, and tho Pacific
Grove Retreat Association, which had
charge of its moral and prudential man
agement, deemed It advisable. In the na
ture of tho case, to place certain buslnosa
and pleasure restrictions upon the re
treat. The Pacific Improvement Com
pany Indorsed those rules and regula
tions and the camp ground has developed
into the city without their alteration, ex
cept in minor dotnils. Now ili:ft Pacific
(imve has grown to national repute nnd
visitor? from all parts of America and
olsewhere are coming to the town, thi.ro
Is an Increasing feeling of dissatisfac'.ion
over the restrictions, many persona say-
Ing th?y retp.rd tho progress of the city,
and the* formulation and circulation Â«>f
the present .petition is the culmination of
this feeliiigr. The petitioners feel very
confident of the sucress of their effort.

Chaplin's denial of the reported indebted
ness of the firm to the Globe Bank caustd
a sensation, as he stated that the firm
was reported as owing more than a mil

Chaplin explained, by charging the notes

thought to make it prudent to do so now.

EXTRA SESSION TOPICS
RECEIVE ATTENTION
GOVERNOR GAGE % REPLIES TO
MERCHANTS'
Rambling Response Leads the Sign
ers to Believe That the Chief
Executive Will Convene
the Legislature.
Governor Gage in a letter to H. P.
Sonntag has acknowledged the receipt of
an extra session petition. v The petition
was signed by merchants and brokers of
this city and forwarded to Sacramento on
December IS. Following is the- text of
the Governor's reply: Â
â  STATE CAPITOL. Dec. 21. 1599
Henry I". Sonntag. President, and Edgar-
Painter, Secretary, North Central Improve- -
ment Association, and Gentlemen of the â¢
"Committee of ' Harbor Improvements":
Tour letter at hand, together with your
petition, requesting, that lit an early date
l-convenÂ» a special .'and extraordinary ses
sion of the Legislature -of the State, for the
purpose of enacting such legislation as Is
necessary to mat the State Harbor Com
missioners Immediately to construct and to
â¢ extend Buch wharves, piers, bulkheads and
breakwaters as In their judgment are do
. manded by the changed conditions and the
rapidly Increasing necessities of the com
' mercial and shipping requirements of the
- port of San Francisco.
'A request of this character, made over
the signatures of such a splendid body of
gentlemen. distinguished, among other
things, for their wonderful business sagac
ity, an well as for their gntat wealth. in
fluence, Integrity and honor, certainly in
dicates the Importance of the question un
der consideration; and I beg leave to as
sure you that In view of its' gravity I
will give the subject further and careful
attention at my earliest opportunity.
â While I am well aware of the necessity
for amendment In our laws to Increase the
powers of the Slate Board of Harbor Com
mlÃsloners. in order that It may bo en
abled to care for and meet the constantly
Increasing demands of the shipping Inter- â 
ests affecting the great and flourishing city
of San Francisco as well as the entire
State, I am likewise deeply Impressed with
the idea that an extra session would un
avoidably entail considerable unusual ex
pense upon the State. â¢
In order to properly determine whether
the Interests of the people of the State
would be best subserved by a call for an
extra session for this purpose I will be ,
obliged to consider arguments against such .
a course as well as those advanced In favor
of It. among which latter are these fur
nished by yourselves, and also the data
furnished by the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners.
Under the policy of State economy by me
i maintained, perhaps It Is not inopportune
to - observe that In the mere mutter of
vetoes alone 1 have thus far saved the peo
ple of the State J2,67ti,131. Again, the gen
eral and special appropriation bills during
the two first years of my. able and hon
. orable predecessor's term amounted to more
than 55.04U.202. whereas these appropriations '
under the first two years of my official term
are less than J0. 907. 4 18, making a balance
so far as these items alone are concerned
in favor of this administration for its first
two years of more than $2,132,784. Adding .
to this last Hum the amount. of my vetoes
and you have a gross saving of J4.5C5.915.
Or, In other words, by vetoes and by com
parative economy I have already saved to
the taxpayers of the State during my brief
administration upward of $3200 per day,
Sundays, holidays and all Included, during
my entire official term, whether I should
or should not live out the term of office.
Or. again limiting this computation to the
first two years of my administration, It
Is equivalent to a savins of more than
$6000 per day. 'And notwithstanding this
economy, every institution. of the State has .
had liberal but not lavish allowances.
While mean saving In any of the Stat*
3 departments has not been and will not be
â  my policy, still my resolve to continue to
. economically administer the affairs of the
State leads me to give serious considera
tion to the matter of expense which would
accrue from an extra session.
At ft very early time, however. I shall
give the subject the deliberation to. which
Its Importance -is entitled, and meanwhile
I will be pleased to receive all further In
formation which you or others may deslr*
to furnish. Very respectfully your*.

ELIAS MUSCAT IS
CONVICTED OF MURDER
In Spite of His Own Testimony, a
Jury Finds Him Guilty of Kill-
ing Mrs. de Sanchez.
Ellas Muscat, charged with the murder
of Sebastlna Oritgoza de Sanchez, was
last night convicted by a Jury in Judge
Lawler'a court of murder in the second
degree. He took the stand yesterday
and Â»6aid that instead of murder
ing the woman he endeavored to prevent
her firing the shot that ended her life. He
said that he met the . woman at Vallejo
and lived with her five months there and
then came to this city. They had fre
quent quarrels, and on the night of her
death they were In the saloon at Broad
way and Kenrny street. He said that
he was standing near a window looking
out. He heard her approach from behind
and looking up saw her pointing a revol
ver at her head. He grasped the weapon,
but she pulled the trigger and fell dead
to the floor, a bullet In her brain. When
asked whether or not he admitted having
killed the woman he said that he had no
recollection of having made a confession,
his mind being a blank for several days
after the tragedy.
LEGAL RATE TOR GAS.
Justice Dunn Holds That It Is SI 50
Per Thousand Feet.
Justice Dunn has rendered his opinion
in the case of the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company against H. G. Cupples,
one of Its patrons, who was sued for
payment for gas furnished. The company
submitted a bill to Cupples for 4000 cubic
feet of gas at the rate of Si 75 a thousand,
and Cupples claimed that the legal rate la
SI 10.
Justice Dunn holds that the resolution
passed by the Board of Supervisors on
April 3, 1899. fixing the rate at Si 10 is Il
legal, because companies and corpora
tions, as distinguished from Individuals,
who furnish gas, were alone subjected to
the provisions of the resolutions.
The resolution passed by the board sub
sequent to April 3, In which the rate Is
fixed at SI 50. Is held to be valid by Jus
tice Dunn, because the word "person,"
which was missing In the first resolution,
was supplied. Therefore, the rate to be
charged and collected for gas In this city
and county from July 1, l!>:Â«0. Is $1 50 per
1000 feet.
Cupples' contention that he only burned
1571 cubic feet insted af 4000 as returned
by the gas company, was not sustained
by the court, as ho could bring no satis
factory evidence that ho had not burned
the larger amount.
KILLED BY A FALL.
Carpenter Ryan Stepped Upon a
Temporary Flooring to His
Death.
William Ryan, a carpenter, residing at
1208 Turk street, was accidentally killed
at 2 o'clociv yesterday afternoon in the
building at 321 Pine street by falling
through tlie floor of the second story, a
distance of about twenty feet.
The imildinK was being repaired and re
modekil. and Hy.in was working on th.
second floor near the elevator sh:tft. The
opening of the shaft in the floor had been
boarded up with tnrinue and grooved
boards to ..eep the dust and debris out
of the brokers" office of Stauf & Cooper,
on the first floor. Ryan, believing that
this temDorary flooring would support his
weight, stepped upon it. when the boards
gave way precipitating him to the office
below. He was unconscious when picked
up, and died In the ambulance on thÂ«
way to the Harbor Hospital.

MANILA. Doc. 22.â The newspaper
Democracla, the organ of a coterie of
Filipinos, including the Supreme Court
Judges, favoring American control In the
Philippines, to-night announces that it
has been decided to suspend publication.
The paper was started at the suggestion
and under the patronage of the Philip
pine Advisory Commission, headed by
Professor J. O. Schurman. The Demo
craela prints a single page, in big type.
In the statement accompanying the an
nouncement of Its suspension, the editor
says he has been directed by th. pro
vost, marshal to retract certain criticism
of the clerical methods adopted in regard
to the management of schools, and add 3:
Recognizing the authority of the provost mar
thai, we have no recourse except la comply
and have decided to suspend publication until
the present extraordinary conditions regard
ing press matters disappear. When we know
what laws rule us, by what mode we are Judged
and to whose Jurisdlcti<Â«Â» press matters are
amenable, the Dcmocracla will reappear.
â¢ The paper has generally been a warm
supporter of the administration. The pro
vost marshal recently threatened to sup
press it for publishing an editorial as
serting that Manila streets were in a
worse condition under the American than
they had been under the Spanish admin
istration. â¢
The Manila Times also was recently
warned, with an Intimation of Imprison
ment and confiscation, for printing an edi

An Excellent Combination.
â¢ The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well' known remedy.
Syrup, of Tigs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
bast* and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from' senna end
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. -In order to get its beneficial

Ing the mountains In the region of Liberty
ranch and the Summit House, frightening
women and children and In several In-
BtAnces striking apprehension into the
minds of ;â <!:.,,:.Â« who are not disturbed
by i rifles. The alarm occasioned by the
knowledge that a maniac Is wandering
around untrammeled wuu Increased to
day by t.is making an attack on three
:....i.; boyfe, who owe their escape from
death or injury to the fact that a horse
they were driving Utcajno untuunagablo

Harry Kolaud and Archie and Charles j
Ltwll took a hone and buggy this morn- I

and i ;. .-::.(; a heavy bludgeon as If to '
warn them bark uttered an inarticulate I
mats of words that almost frightened the j
Imjjb out of their sense*. Little Charley I
Lewis addressed the man civilly, wherei
upon ho showed his teeth und snarling I
like a wild Least l^-.ui Elowly to ad* |
vance' toward the buggy. At this June- i
ture the horse took fright at the etrange

ing his club and shouting in a frenzied
manner. 7"hr-y wore co badly frightened
that they alxindoned their intention of
gathering J> i :.* and would not return to
town until the tslage came along and acted
as escort.
The boys describe the wild man a* belr.*
about six feet tail and garbed in tattered
clothes, with a hat minus half .thy brjm.
His face was covered with a fcrajrgy
nr'iwth cf beard. This description answi-r's
that of thÂ«* man who ftveral weeks u?o

SEARCHING FOR A

Marin Residents Bought His Nos

SAN* RAFAEL. Dec. 22 -The authori
ties of half the towns In Marin County
are assiduously endeavoring to discover
the whereabouts Of a faker who gave thÂ«
name of M. W. Urnwer and represented
himself M a worm specialist. Not only
has this quack managed to clean up near
ly a thousand dollars by his dealings with
those of credulous mind, but his pathway
throughout the country is marked by a
long list of victims who have suffered se
vere physical discomfort as "the result of
partaking of his nostrums, in one Instance
a young lady who is suffering from con
sumption almost losing her life. So strong
is the feeling of indignation against
Hrewer that In case he is brought back to
the scene of his exploits it is safo to pro
phesy that he will receive. a decorative
garb not easily parted with. .

All the horses that had been pas.^.l

Consteflator at Long Odds a
Surprise at Oakland â Fer-
guson in Bad Form.
Large, unwieldy fields In racing were
always prolific of upsets and hard luck
stories, and the sport at Oakland yester
day furnished no exception. Several goo.i
things were given an airing, in two in
stances with more than moderate sÂ»ucce*>s.
The Elmwood farm's two-year-old Con
stellator, quietly backed frorrt 25 and *)
down to 12. took the mile for all ages In
clever fashion. He was ridden by Bu< n
anan. and after petting nway none too
well gradually moved to the front. beat-
Ing Bogus Bill five lengths. The favorite.
Ailenna, with Jack Martin up. finished a
close third.
Mr. Ferguson suffered from an attack of
barrier fright, some of his starts coming
In for severe criticism. In the. fourth
event the webbing was carried away, Md
most of the boys, thinking it no start, be
gan pulling up. Dlncovering their mistake,
all started for the wire with the excep
tion of Jones, on Ben Ledi. who had
taken the tllly up to a walk. In the last
r;n .â¢ ther.' wa.-Â» more complaint, i.'asddle
was sent away flying, with Silver Tone,
the plunged on favorite, and Gauntlet,
second choice, hopelessly out of It.
In all three favorites were defeated. The
track was very fast, but the caliber of
borac* starting permitted of no record
smashing.
Eighteen maiden two-year-olds lined up
in the Introductory scramble, with. Lim
erick, the Daly entry, ruling favorite. Saul
of Tarsus, against which 15 to 1 wan laid,
led until the pa<ido-k waa reached, where
Morgan on the favorite collared him. win

Track Notes.
The owner of Ben I.Mi backed his fllly
extensively and felt somewhat affronted
at the Judges for replacing Hlneon with
Jones. The colored lad had won on the
fllly at Tanforan. Still there Is no deny
ing the fact that Jones Is a far superior
rider. Looking at it the other wa>
slbly Hinpon would not have been left at
the post. If Mr. Ferguson had recalled
the field, which he should have done, and
what three-fourths of the riders thought
he would do. there would have been no
roost for argument.
While W. Ijirzelere was engaged In
backing his horse. Silver Tone, off the
boards. Jim Quinn slipped some coin
around the ring on Cundale. The latter
was away flying, while Silver Tone might
just a* well have remained In his stall.
Such Is racing luck.
Merry Hoy. played from M to o. was one
of the m" ively backed horses

MASTERS OF THE
GRIDIRON AGAINST
LOCAL CHAMPIONS
AN ERA IN COAST FOOTBALL
Athletic Event of the Year Will
Be Held on Christmas
Day.
â¢
On Christmas day the Carlisle .Indian
football â¢â¢urn will lino up against the
University of California team on the Six
teenth and Folsom streets gridiron. For
the first time In the history of the game
the West will then be face to face with
the Kast. For years events have been
drifting toward Just such a contest and
[ now that it is upon us a new era for Pa
dflc Coast football has begun. What les
sons the game will teach can only be told
: long after the score is slated in the foot-
I ball book of California.
While the Indians do not represent a big
Eastern college they stand for the acme
of up-to-date football. On Thanksgiving
day In New York City Carlisle's red men
waded right through Columbia's brawn
' to the tune of 45. I. This was their best
performance during the entire season.
Eastern critics who saw the game are of
the opinion that the strongest team In
America played that day. For straight,
hard, llerce football nothing like It has
even been seen In the Baal Marvelous
was the line bucking of Metoxen and the
kicking of Hudson; llerce were the
assaults on center and tackles.- This tame
i team that played likÂ»- a unit will. form la
phalanx next .Monday afternoon and with
tli'e'same dash and 'spirit will hurl them
selves against California's opposition.
California's Thanksgiving nay eleven, the
best the Pacific Coast has produced, will
not, be. the same thai metedÂ»oul ' Btaa
ford the St-0 defeat on November St.
As is the custom with college teams when
th.- big struÃcle of the year is past and
gone all training rules are thrown to the
winds, relaxation ami Indulgence taking
their place it was not until Wednesday
of this week that any real, active worl'
was done by thÂ«Â» blue and gold men.
The last few days have found them hard
at the grilling practice which character
ized their training for the Intercollegiate
game. The perfect machine that tussled
with the cardinal Is not in Its old-tlmo
working order, although It is by no means
deranged. At hern will not be in his posi
tion al right guard, nor will Whlpple be
In the line. Hill at end will give way to
Masters and Hopper may not be found at
quarter
With these changes made absolute by
the necessity of things California will by
no means be as strong as on Thanksgiv
ing <!.'!>. although the. substitutes, with
one exception, are all good, stalwart men.
The practice Thursday afternoon was ex
cellent and showed speed, dash and a
vigorous assault.
The condition of the men has improved
Immeasurably, but it is not the condition
fit for such a battle, as the Indians will
give a gridiron tight that has mowed
down the big. heavy, matured football
teams of the Knst. where the came Is sup
posed to reach the standard of perfec
tion.
it is likely that California win
- m--. something
which the Indians have not as |rel
perfe. â¢â¢ \ matter what mny be said
Hfornta. that eleven Is capable of
playing â  high nr-lcr of football. In the
- of the coachers who have trained
lue and gold .levin all season, "the
team is n . ]'!-iv pre*t
ball, and if the men k<> into the garm
with the proper spirit the Indians will
band "I men against them playing
i a kir..i of football that will force the \is-
Ir best in order to win."

Carlisle was out for signal practice yes
terday and those who had the opportunity
to see the red men at work were not dis
appointed. They line up and play swift.
dashing ball, . but not Immeasurably
swifter and more dashing than the fast
California eleven. The public has a line
eye for the blue and pold team and looks
upon the blue and gold eleven of 1881 as a
remarkably strong aggregation. Bets are
being made that California will score. A
prominent enthusiast and follower of the
blue and pold watered live $100 bets that
that eleven would not come out of the
game without a score. Few or no bets
are placed onthe general result, the score
being the only thing that will admit of a
difference of opinion. Yet all this is reck
oning without the host, and football
games have been synonymous with sur
prises.
The accident to Cochran on Thursday
hÂ«s taken away from the Callfornlans Its
chief coach and best helper, but such lit
tle time remains for the actual training
before the game that this Is not as se
rious a blow as It at first seems. Kelly
will be there to direct and train, and he
knows the Indians' style of play as well
as the great "Garry."
Th. greatest difficulty California will
have la In the filling of right guard, left
vacant by Athern's refusal to play. The.
latest candidate Is Luce, a new man to
th> team and without creat experience.
The teams will line up Christmas day:

A series of six games against the All-

all the holidays up to and Including New
Year's day. These note* will be the last
in which such favorites as Harvey. Doyle
and Eagan will appear in the Sacramento
uniform, as they have been signed by
Eastern teams. The dlsbandment of the
Bacraraentoi means the disintegration of
the finest ball team ever organized In this
State. it is conceded that there never
whs such an aggregation of baseball tal
ent in the California League, and Mana
ger Kripp realizes that he will have a
hard time trying to retain a sufficient
number of his players to form a nucleus
for next year's team.
The AJI-Callforntans are sore over their
defeat at the hands of the Oakland*.
They attribute it to the fact that they did
not nave their team, and that their pitch
ers were suffering from lame shoulders.
but they will present a solid front against

The men Interested In the future of

withdrawn! of the Ingleslde Coursing Club
from the California Coursing Committee
win not be carried out. Tne sport I* gain-
Ing ground dally and to take so radllcal .i
Step would mean to place It In a state of

both themselves and their greyhounds

As the differences of opinion have been

been abandoned, the dov*\ emblematic of

rival camps.
The possibility of an oversupply of
greyhounds, which seemed Imminent for a
time, has disappeared, owing to the great
mortality among the young dogs. Hun
dreds of puppies which, on blood lines,
should equal the best In the world have
died during the past year. The majority
have succumbed to distemper.

only about two survive distemper and
other ailments peculiar to young grey

The reciprocity treaties are acts of the administra

and recommended by it lor ratification by Concrete
Support of the administration, therefore, eon-idered
from the reciprocity standpoint, means support of
these treaties, which take away from the West to give
to the East. Just how the treaties ?re to be beaten by
supporting them is a problem which Kohlsaat may
give oct and the Sun may shine on. but the people
will still fail to understand.
â¢ %o Â«<-pÂ«t>l:ran is objectinÃ to the election of a
proper mnn to the Senate from this State. But when
he is elected we shall expect him to oppose and not

San Francisco.
A CHRISTMAS COURTESY
One time for making par
chases for Christmas it will be well for all who
have an opportunity to do their shopping in
the day time to bear in mind that a considerable num
ber of men and women arc employed during the day
and their only time to shop is in the evening. It will
be thcrciore no more than a due consideration for the
rights of the latter class for others to complete their
shopping before 5 P- m. and leave the stores in the
evening to those who cannot go earlier.
The pleasure of passing an evening in wandering
from store to store to look upon the bright and at
tractive articles exposed for sale and to share in the
animation of the gift-seeking throng is undoubtedly
very great to a considerable number of persons, and
there will be a Mrong enticement to them to go
"shopping" to-night even if they have no intention of
buying anything. A little reflection, however, will
show them it is not right to do so. Thousands of
hard-working men and women who have had little . -
no chance during the week to make their Christmas
purchases will have but this one evening in which to
do it They ought to have the right of way in the
stores, and should not be crowded out by mere tight
seers.
A little exercise in public of those courtesies which
make social life so charming will add to the pleasure
of the Christmas for all. If those who can shop early
will <Jo so and then get out of the way there will be
convenience all round. The matter requires no ar
gument. To the considerate it is enough to remind
them of the courtesy due to the others, and they will
leave the Saturday night for the shopping of the
workers.
BREACHES OP NEUTRALITY.
THERE is rising talk in England of a demon
stration agauw Portugal because Boer stores
are believed to be landed in Delagoa Jiay and
Boer recruits go that way to join the fighters.
There \< something ama/ing in the coolness with
which the j-ei/ure. of the port of Lourenzo Marquez 's
prop . measure to end the war in three
month* i'y shutting out Bsppliet which arc now sup
1 to reach the Boers over Portuguese territory.
Bat how about the- military luppjies which are
reaching England across United States territory?
Food for men and <1 millions of ortridges
are furnished !â  " d within our jurisdiction and
r territory to be used against the
riginating in Canada
â¢ire moved from British territory into ours, and are
prepared within our jurisdiction for shipment to the
Cape
Will any ore explain why this is not a violation of
the neutrality laws if the shipment of stores to the
- a 'Toys Portuguese territory is such viol I
The Boers cannot reach us except by a protect, to
which thiÂ« Government has paid no attention because
the two Dutch republics cannot compel our obser
vance of neutrality. But England can reach Portu
gal, a weak power, and in pursuance of her criminal
aggression in South Africa can safely bully that Gov
ernment, while a cowardly world l<">kÂ« on. indifferent
to the right or wrong of the proceeding. If Lou
renro Marquez is occupied by a Bnti-h fleet, and
Delagoa Bay is seized to shut off Boer supplies, and
the United States continue to pour war supplies into
the lap of Great Britain it will be the crime of the
ages.
Thr people of this country do not wish their Gov
ernment to be a party to such an act. The peddlers
who are celling pork and powder to (irent Britain
! have le" influence at Washington than the
'. whose republican sympathies are stronger
than their greed.
Tin lo not wish this country to hold John
Bull's coat while he whips the Boers. Already there
has been too much official sympathy shown toward
England. We have officially notified the world that
this country has never recognized the Transvaal Re
public. The people tlunk this would be a good time
rrect that omission by granting such recognition
and sending a Minister to Pretoria and requesting
President Kruger to send one here.
The recogniti i ivernment i*. under our cu~
! torn, an executive act If President MeKinley would
at once recognize the Transvaal and aÂ»k Congr
appropriate money to assume diplomatic relations
with that country he would be acting in line with
tradition and practices, and no act would

A new warning on the subject of consumption
comes in the report from Michigan that a number of
clerks encaged in examining the State records were
attacked by tin- disease. The books .vcre examined
by a bacteriologist, who found them full of tubercle
bncilli. It is thought that they became infected from
a clerk who had consumption, and who had the habit
of moistening his thumb with saliva when he turned
a page.
SOUTHERN PATRIOTISM AND BATTLE
PARKS
S( iMF sensitive patriots were once of the opinion
it would be a labc policy on the part of the
Government to provide any lasting memorial*
of the Civil War. Such people feared that all monu
ments <>r celebrations of that kind would tend to keep
alive the animosities of the South and to perpetuate
the ueling of ftntagonism to the Union. Even
; ; iarl<> Sumner shared the belief, and he once in
troduced into the Senate a resolution providing that
the names oi battles fought during the Civil War be
from the flaps of the regiment s.
All -uch fear* were ill-founded; the Southern pen
pie have returned to the Union with as keen a love
f<>r the old flag and an appropriation as the peo|
any other portion of the country. Their attitude
rd the Government and the war has been
Strikingly illustrated by the course taken by them
with respect to the establishment of national parks
on battle-fields where victories were won for the
Union. The Southerners were at one time sensitive
on the subject and shoved some dislike to the parks
established on their soil to commemorate the defeat
of their kinsmen. In a comparatively short time,
however, they began to take I different view of tht
matter. They are very sagacious fellows, these
Southerners. They soon observed that battle parks
i are attractive pleasure grounds, and they set about
encouraging the Government to provide them trher
there could be shown any slightest reason for
i them.
The city of Atlanta is the latest aspirant for a na
tional park. This city has sonic reason for rcmeni
bering the war with a shudder. It was there that
â  Sherman pave the country a demonstration of his
i favorite theory that 'war is hell." He shelled the
, city while it was filled with women and children and
burned it to the ground after he captured it. One

raged a- renu .is Sherman waged it -t
Atlanta. All that, however, counts for nothing now.
The Atlanta people perceive a chance to get a large.
well-kept park provided for them at the expense of
thr National Government, and it matters nothing to
then that it will commemorate their defeat in a war
' t years ago by men of a former generation. The
thing that interests them is that it will be a pleasure
d for the men of this and of future generations
and will cost them nothing.
In urging the enterprise upon Congress the Atlanta
Constitution says: "The movement .concerns not one
; but the brigades of both armies, and if it be success
: ful. as it should be (for it appeals to the highest sen
| timents of both sides), the national park which will
j be the result will commemorate the valor displayed

by the troops of both armies in all the great battles
i that occurred in the immediate vicinity of Atlanta.
It is fitting that the Federal Government, which now
stands for all who were engaged, should establish
the proposed national park and embellish it on t
scale commensurate with the heroism displayed in
j the struggle in which the American soldiers were
matched against themselves."
In conclusion the Constitution adds: "We cannot
conceive of an objection that can be made against
the acquirement of the battle-field of Peachtree
Creek by the Government and the establishment on
that historic ground of a national park." Certainly
The Call ha? no objection to urge. Our only regret
is that Fremont did not have a fight with somebody
on the site of Sntro's forest so that we could get the
;ial Government to buy that and give a free park
to San Francisco as well as to Atlanta.
If it be true, U reported, that Great Britain has
made large concessions to German railway interests
in Africa, we can now understand why the Kaiser was
so eager to visit his grandmother immediately after
the war with the Boers hroke out. and also why he
has no longer any sympathy with Oom Paul.
WITH a view of presenting to Congressmen a
series of terse and strong arguments in favor
of the upbuilding of the American merchant
marine engaged in foreign trade the Marine Re
view of Cleveland, Ohio, has issued an attractive and
valuable pamphlet containing articles prepared by
leading statesmen.. naval officers, ship-owners, ship
builders, manufacturers and merchants. Among the
contributor;- are such men as Admirals Dewey, Samp
and Schley, ex-Senator Edmunds. Speaker Hen
ri. E. T. Chamberlain. Commissioner Â«>l Xavi-
D, and T. C. Search, president of the American
Association of Manufacturers.
It is not surprising that men representing all the
great industries of the people should unite in support
of the movement for an adequate supply of merchant
\r-rls on the ocean, since the interests of all are con
cerned in the promotion of commerce. As Mr. K<!
mundi says: "The factory can do nothing without
the aid of the farm, the mine and the forest; the
workmen can do nothing without the mills, tools and
Other appliances of all sort-, nor without fair and
prompt pay; their employers cannot pay them un
less they can find markets for 'and sell the goods -o
madeâ therefore the more varied ami tr.ore exten
sive the market- the greater is thÂ« opportunity for .ill
iperative works t.> p() , m successfully. Thus
it is manifest thai every occupation and every accu
mulation of capital in our country have a common in
terest in promoting anÂ«l increasing our export trade."
At present nearly the whole of our foreign trade is
carried in foreign vessels, and the Marine Review es
timates they take away from this country more than
$150,000,000 annually ;is freight upon our imports and
exports That means we !oÂ«e the u>e of that vast
Mini in giving employment to our labor in ship
. building or in navigation, and we leave our foreign
commerce exposed to the vicissitudes of other na
tions.
The London Engineer is quoted as stating
in a recent number: "The gro--; capacity of
the American vessels available for ocean traffic
not exceed 300.000 tons out of an ag
ite of -MOO.OOO tons, while England pos
npon v.000.000 tons." Again it says:
"American ships are virtually unknown in the trade
between neutral countries, and out of about 24.500.00-j
tons of shipping clearing from American ports in the
course of a year not more than one-fifth flies the stars
and vtripe-; and as showing incidentally how much
of America's loss in this respect has been Great Brit
j ian's gain it may be stated that out of 18.000,000 tons
of exclusively foreign shipping cleared 12.000,000 are
English."
The wisdom of learning from an enemy in war hn<
long been known. There would be an equal wisdom
in learning from 1 competitor in commerce. The
facts compiled in this little pamphlet nre timely and
can hardly fail to have influence upon the minds of
Congressmen when they come to vote upon the ship
ping bill at this se-si.m.
General Roberts can hardly regard hi<; appointment
to command in South Africa a- an acceptable Christ
mas gift, for it may cause him the loss of the laurels
nc,ha? rather than provide him with new ones.
OKI" of the minor ill effects of the proposed re
ciprocity treaties which if carried out will ex
pose the industries of a considerable number
of our people to tin- unrestrained competition of for
eign labor has been that of reviving the aggressive
ness of the free trader- and encouraging them to re
new their attacks upon the whole protective system.
We are thus in danger of having a new agitation on
that subject and another disturbance of the conditions
upon which our prosperity is based.
An illustration of the promptness with which the
free trade organs nrc taking advantage of the opening
it afforded by the comment of the New York f'.-t
upon a bill introduced by Senator Lodge amending
the tariff <o v to put hides on the free list. It is well
known that the manufacturers of boots and shoes
have long desired free bides, and the bill is a move
ment to accomplish the fulfillment of their desire.
Referring ti> the efforts of the manufacturers to get
rid of the ditty on hides the Post says: '"They will
not get it repealed, however, or not in the direct wnv
proposed by Senator Lodge, because that would re
open the whole tnritT question. They may pet it done,
however. b> way of reciprocity There is a treaty now
pending with Argentina in which hides are admitted
at 20 per c-nt reduction of the Dingley tax. Let the
Senators from Massachusetts get this treaty amended
to admit hides from Argentina free. This can be done
in secret session, and even if it were in open session
there would be no effective qpposttton to it. Then the
same rule that we apply to Argentina would needs he
applied to other South American countries, and grad
unlly we thai] Ret back to the happy condition we
were in before Dingley t<>.,k hold of the matter, and
without danger of reopening the whole tariff ques
tion."
It is not to be denied the satire of that is clever,
nor that the argument is good. Why try to amend
the tariff when every particle of protection can be
eliminated by reciprocity treaties? If by treaties with
foreign countries the industries of California can be
deprived of the advantages of protection, why may
not other treaties leave the interests of Eastern manu
facturers equally exposed"
It is wisdom on the part of the leaders of a politi
cal party to pay attention to the attacks of opponents.
The foe is very sure to pick out the weakest point of
a particular policy and assail it. The reciprocity
provisions of the tariff law as applied by Kasson are
the weak points in the tariff policy of the administra
tion, and such attacks as are made upon it by acute
critics like the Post are bound to hurt the party if the
tactics are pursued.

The following is the origin of "Truce
cheers and a tiger " In 1522 the Boston
Light Artillery, under command of Â«'ip
tain Mackintosh and Lieutenant Robert
<". Wlnthrop, visited Salem. Mass.. and
encamped en Washington square. During
their stay there a few of their members
indulged in sports incidental to camp if.',
when some visitor exclaimed to one who
was a little rough. "Oh. you tiger." It
became a catchword and as .1 term of
playful reproach "You're a tiger" v. ,-.
adopted as one of the peculiar phrases of
the corps. On the route to Boston some
musical genius sang an impromptu in-.
"Oh. you tigers, don't you know," to the
tune of "Rob Roy McGregor. Oh:" "of
course the appellation soon indrced the
tigers by nr.me to imitate the actions of
the tigers, and the howl was introduced.
At the end of three cheers a ".'k- or
howl was Invariably called for. In ivÂ»Â»>
the infantry visited New York City, being
the first volunteer corps to make .1 trip
from Boston to another State, and while
there the tietrs at â  public festival awoke
the hoes and astonished the Gothamltea
by giving a good Imitation of the genuine
howl. It pleased the fancy of tne ho-ts
and gradually became adopted on all fes

"Three eheen and a tiger" became the in

as far as California street. There It
turned up Into Kearny. thence back again
to Market, and out that street to Van

wÂ«rÂ« held.
The men, la their new suit*, shining
â¢tars. spotless cloves and well polished
shoes, certainly made a neat and satis
factory appearance and created an Im
pression bo favorable that It was lmpos-
EJble not to take some civic pride in a
municipality that was able to produce
such a fine looking body of men.
There were two battalions in line, com
manded by Captains Wlttman and
Fpniane. each platoon of which was un
der the charge of a sergeant attired in
handsome uniform, carrying a sword and
enjoying a sense of the Importance of the
pa*rÂ«ant of which he was a part. A mount

ready to pick up any one who should fall
by the wayside or suffer sunstroke at tho

DANGEROUS DISCRIMINATION
NEW YORK THOUGHT TO BE
AFTER THE TRAFFIC.
Tea Importers at the port of San Fran
cisco are very much agitated over a re
cent order of the Secretary of the Treas
ury, requiring all samples of \ea admit
ted Into the United States to be forwarded
to tho Tea Examiner at the port of New
York In order that uniformity might be
eecured.
Prior to th Issuance of this order there
were numerous complaints that tea ex
aminer* at ports other than San Francisco
wer* admitting teas of Inferior grades to
those required at San Francisco. It was
urged that such discrimination would tend
to divert all the tea Imports from San
Francisco and Into the ports admitting the
Inferior grades. In order to obviate this
dlClculty and ensure uniformity In the
grading of teas the Secretary of the
Treasury made the recent order which has
caused co much commotion among im
porters.
It Is now claimed that Now York, by
reason of th&> ruling, will take away the
tra Importing business of San Francisco
and divert It to New York. Action .to
avert this calamity was taken yesterday
by tha leading Importers In this city, and
a resolution adopted by them at a called
mass meeting was transmitted on th<Â» way
to Artlng Secretary Spauldlng at-Wash
ington. Accompanying the resolution
was a letter from Charles B. Platt,

member of the Board of United States
Tea Kxperts. In which among other
things Mr. Platt says:
While I adroit that Mr. Hewlett made the
recommendation In rood faith and for thÂ«
purpose < ' producing uniformity in the ex
amination of teas, yet If I. as a member of â 
the Board of United States Tea Experts, had â 
been Dele â¢ before the recommendation
vrtut made. I should have deemed It my duty
to rigorously orpose lbÂ« same on the ground
that it would be absolutely un'alr to
permit the examiner at New York to assist
In reviewing the work of the examiners at
Chicago and San Francisco, unless the ex
aminers at thoxe ' t>olnts ! had equal oppor
tunity of reviewing the work of each ex
aminer. I believe this would have .an ex
cellent effect toward producing uniformity.
The following Is a copy of the resolution
forwarded to -Washington by. the import
ers:
Hon. Lyman J. Gare. Secretary of thÂ«
Treasury. Washington.. D. Câ Sir: The un
dersljrr.ed tea importers respectfully request
a modification of the order of October IS.
UN, dlrcctlne that samples of all teas
passed by the various Custom-houses out
side of New York be sent to the examiner
at New York, the object of which Is that
certain -of these samples shall be selected for
submission and Investigation by the Board
of Tea Experts at New York at their next
meeting-. As under this order no examiner
has been directed to select samples from
New York Importations (which cover sixty
per cent of the total Imports of tea) wÂ« re
quest In order that no one port shall ba
favored or exempted that the. order . be.
changed or to modified as to order the New
York examiner to send, two or four ounce
samples of all teas passed by him to each
of the examiners at Chicago and San Fran
cisco, and that said examiners be Instructs
to scrutinize the samples rent them In the .
same manner as the New York examiner
is to do with the samnlen sent him from
other ports. Very respectfully.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 23, 1899.
First the men were drawn up In one

SAILORS' HOME
LOST TO BOARD
OF SUPERVISORS
Place to Be Vested in
Board of Trustees.
WILL BE OUT OF POLITICS
FEDERAL AND CITY AUTHORI-
TIES WILL CONTROL.
The Bailors' Home Is to "be taken out
of politics. That Is. the renting of the
building. Is to be taken out of. the hands
of the Supervisors and vested In a com-
I posite board consisting of the Mayor, City
I and County Attorney, the Collector of
! Customs, the United States District Judge
J and the United States District Attorney.
For a long time the Ladies' Seamen's
I Aid Society has had control of the prem
ises at a nominal rental of a dollar a
year. In turn the ladies sublet the privi
lege to a superintendent, who runs the
place for them and makes a monthly re
turn of moneys received and expended.
Many an effort has been made to get the
building: away from the Ladies' Seamen's
Aid Society, but the late Captain Charles
Uoodall was ever the champion of the
women, and through his efforts the Super
visors were always compelled to renew
the lease of the building to the society. '
Captain Goodall and his partner. Sen
ator George C. Perkins, had many a dis
cussion over the Sailors* Home. Both
men wanted to see the institution a real
benefit to the sailor, and they both knew
that there was no chance of instituting
permanent reforms so long as there was a
chanco of some ward politician getting
hold of the place through the" Board of
Supervisors, A bill was framed, there
fore, taking the control of the building
, away from the Board of Supervisors and
vesting it in the gentlemen named above.
It has been introduced In the Senate by
Senator Perkins, and will undoubtedly be
come law. as X has the backing of the
California delegation.
The Sailors' Home building was former
:ly the United States Marine Hospital.
j When thÂ« place was abandoned as not
suitable for the purposes and the hospital
was removed to the Presidio. Uncle Sam
| presented the building and grounds to the
city and county of San Francisco to be
I used as a. Sailors' Home. Soon after the
building came under control of the Super
visors It was let to the Ladles' Seamen's
Aid Society, and that body has had con
trol of it ever since. There were some
scandals in connection with â  the place
particularly when one Swannack was su
perintendent, but since Captain Melvln
Staples has been In charge there have
been no complaints.
The placing of the home under the joint
control of the city and Federal authorities
will do away with wire-pulling and will
enable the Ladies' Seamen's Aid Society
to make many .Improvements which- the
uncertain tenure of their lease prevented
them from doing.
COASTERS MAKE PORT.
John S. Kimball's Son Home.
San Pedro Chartered for
Nome Trade.
The northeast wind brought In quite a
fleet of coasters yesterday. Six of them
got In during the morning, while at sunset
the barks Prussia and Kate Devenport
and the schooners James A. Garfield, Ben
der Brothers, Gem, Archie and Fontle,
John V. Miller and Compeer were all
passing In. Many more vessels are du<\
and there is no doubt but what every man
on the fleet Is trying to reach port before
Christmas
Nick Houston, a marine fireman, made
an attempt tp end his life yesterday.
Every time Nick gets drunk he jumps
overboard, and yesterday he took the loup
from Main street wharf. Nick took too
many â¢Tom and Jerrys" during the morn-
Ing and missed his ship. When he found
the steamer gone he pulled off his coat
and Jumped overboard. He was rescu^l
by Wharfinger McGovern and Collector
Sullivan, who locked him up until hjs
friends called for him and took him home.
Spear street wharf is crowded with Ore
gon freight, and in consequence the
<;'..rj;.- w. Elder on her arrival from
Portland will have to dock at the sea
wall.
John S. Kimball of the well-known sh'p
ping house of Kimball & Co. will arrive
from Seattle to-night, accompanied by his
wife and son. Charles E. Kimball went
to Nome in connection with the firm's
business, nnd was taken ill with typhoid
fever while on his way home on the
steamer Aloha. The vessel put Into Puget
how to hold their rifles, with the result
that some rested in place, some stood at
attention and some presented arms, thus
Sound and Mr. Klmball was landed at
Seattle. His father and mother Imme
diately went to his bedside and have been
with him t ver since. Father, mother and
son will now be home In time for the fam
ily reunion on Christmas day.
The steamer San Pedro has been char
tered from J. K. Hanlfy & Co. by Los
Angeles parties, and will run between Sun
Diego. San Francisco and Cape Nome in
the spring. About $10,000 will be expended
In turning the vessel Into a passenger
steamer, with accommodations for W
people. Th.> San Pedro Is a new vessel
and one of the smartest steam schooners
on the coast
A SAILOR ROBBED.
Henry Lacsen of the Ship Bohemia
Has an Unpleasant Experience.
Henry Lonswi of the ship Bohemia,
who live* In East Berkeley, was robbed
of a pursÂ© containing $140 In gold and
some papers late- Thursday 'night, and the
police are trying to find the robber.
Lansen was found at Second and Town
send streets shortly before midnight by
Special Officer Cunningham. He was con
siderably under the influence of liquor and
there was a contused wound over his
right eye. Cunningham turned him over
to Policeman T. R Gibbons. He told the
officers that ho had been robbed of the
purse, but by whom he did not know.
Gibbons sent Lansen to the Receiving
Ho&pital, where hia wound was dressed,
and he was booked at the City Prison on
a charge of "drunk." When searched
$2 40 was found In Ms pockets.
Gibbons learned that Lansen had been
drinking In G. Nicholas' saloon. 2Â«8 Bran
nan street, and had been beaten and
thrown out. Ho went to the saloon and
Nicholas admitted that Lansen had been
drinking there with some other sailors,
but he denied that he had been beaten
and thrown out, and there the matter
rests at present.
DEADLY GAS AGAIN.
Mrs. C. J. Smith Falls a Victim to
the Silent Destroyer.
Mrs. C. J. Smith, a domestic servant
employed in the family of B. F. Hawes.
at 321 Lyon street, was found lying dead
on the floor of her room yesterday morn-
Ing. The condition of tho body showed
that death was the result of an accident.
The woman was fully rtrowofl â¢
that her shoes were oft*. Sin- ha.l ;irl>.'ti
from her bed and attempted to reach the
door, but fell unconscious to the floor.
One of the stopcocks of the gas fixture
was partly turned on.
It Is belirvÂ«-d t ti.it the dead woman had
lain on the bed to read before retiring on
the evening previous, and that she turned
down the gas to take a nap. Air In the
pipe extinguished the low flame ami tlie
gas filled the room and killed the woman.
Mrs. Smith had gone to the Hawes fam
ily only tho day before, and they wero
very well pleased with her. She "seemed
to be In good spirit?. She was a trained
nurse, but berng unable to secure employ
ment she sought to do housework. Her
husband is a printer, at present absent
frorr the city. MrÂ«. Smith was 29 years
old and a native of California. An Inquest
will be held.

Not Fair to Blackman.
W. R. Blackman. secretary of a Los
Angeles lighting company, was convicted
of felony for getting away with about
$11,000. He appealed to the Supreme Court,
one of the grounds being that after the
court had instructed the jury anrf while
the District Attorney was addressing that
body the Judge left the bench and court
room and was absent for about ten min
uteÃ. The Supreme Court holds that
without the immediate presence of the
Judge there can be no court, and that a
defendant ronvicted without the Judge
being present all of the time has Just
cause for complaint and good grounds for
a reversal of Judgment of conviction.
The case was sent back for a new trial.
Christmas Dinner.
"Christmas comes but once a year." Cele
brate It thin year at Zlnkand's. A specially
fine dinner every holiday. â¢
Misplaced Confidence.
William Brown, a discharged soldier
from the Finn Infantry, who arrived
from Manila recently, complained to Cap
tain Spillane yesterday that his purse
containing $177 ttfi and his discharge papers
had been stolen from him. He said he
left the wharf Thursday morning and
walked along Folsom street. He went
into a saloon and asked a young man to
hold his overcoat for a few minutes
for him. In the overcoat pocket was the
purse. When he returned the young mnn
had gone and so had his purse. Police
man Moriarity was sent with him but he
was unable to point nut the saloon
A. D. T. Boys
Will deliver Christmas presents In the city
or across the bay at reasonable rates. â¢
adding: diversity to a spectacle, which,
while pleasing, might otherwise have be
come monotonous.
When this bizarre effect had been
achieved to the taste of the venerable
chief, he waved his hand and the "Sassa
fras" band struck up the rather surges
time tune, "When You Alnt Got No
Money, Well. You Needn't Come Round."
Then Aid Blrdsall compelled his steed
to do a Mobile buck and. saluting: when
he came within the sphere of guberna
torial influence, Informed the Executive
and the three Commissioners that the
time had come for them to make their
play.
The carriage with the Inspecting party
moved down the line and the band struck
up "Gates Ajar," which was soon merged
Into a medley composed of "Heart Bowed
Down With Weight of Woe," which seem-
Ed to have such a depressing effect on the
"coppers" that In very charity the musi
cians were forced to cheer them up a bit
with the prospect of future happiness that
"Then You'll Remember Me" conjured up
before their eyes, as the men having their
destinies In hand passed before them.
The carriages drove rapidly around the
line three times. Then the men counted
off and It was found that either Chief
Lees or Sergeant Conboy was It. They
drew straws and the Chief won out. This
was as It should be. All were satisfied ex
cept Tom Walsh, but as he was not seen
In the parade he did not count. The Com
missioners said It was a splendid success;
the Chief said ho had never witnessed
anything finer; Splllane rode from the be
ginning to the end and never showed more
than five Inches of sock at one time. Al
together there was nothing to criticize
and the reviewing party bowed adieu and
departed amid the clashing of cymbals,
while all the stalwart guardians of the
city's dignity cockbllled their yards and
watched them leave.
There was a rumor around the street
yesterday that the Governor had been
seen to uncover In response to a salute.
It could not be confirmed.

credit to him and an ornament to our park.
The generous and benevolent people In our
midst are not all composed of the maie sex.
The names of Mrs. Hearst and Mm. Stan

blest women In the world.
I believe that If the people of Pan Fran
cisco show a disposition to Improve and
beautify their city there may even be
within the sound of my voice generous and
public-spirited rttixens who will make gifts
to the city which will send their numea
down to posterity.
I will now present to you. as presiding
officer this evening, one of our publlc
eplrited citizens, who commenced his work
In e plug the streets of Ban Francisco,
and who will continue his labor until we

the wheel had passed over his body and the shouts of the by

Moore at once delivered himself to the police and was re

It Is- always gratifying to meet honest

a common Interest. This Is really a family
matterâ our home Is that In which we are
now vitally Interested. This matter which
we are now to iIIm'UM might ' be divided
under two heads. A perfect home must
have necessities and also luxuries. To vain

and hospitals are necessities, and we must
have them. I have heard It Bald that these
thlnps will not give us better streets, but
remember that this is all provided for In
the new charter, and as to the harhor,
which has also been brought up. there Is
no need to bond the city to Improve tha
harbor so long as It Is under State con
trol. Now, then, as regards luxuriesâ a
decent house requires a Tew picture* and
a piano. Can we have them? Can we af
ford Fnch luxuries? I say yes. and I say
that the city should be patterned after the
h"me and should also be judiciously
adorned.
With Urn new ypar we start a new dealâ

Association, a poll showed that over two-
320 Taylor street was another eye-witness, and his statement
corroborate! that of Dr. Litton. There Is no doubt In their
rnuul.- that it was a case of deliberate suicide.
The dead man had been hanging about that neighborhood
.eral days and was Intoxicated. Nothing was found
on his person that would Indicate his Identity. He was
dressÂ«ed In a new suit of dark gray clothes (store made), new
tan underclothing, dark brown socks, unlaundered white shirt
and black shoes. The complexion was dark, hair black, clipped
close to the skull, mustache small and black ami eyes gray.
Certain brown patches on the body, covered with dry fish-like
scales, led to the suspicion that he was a leper, but Dr. Zabala,
the autopsy surgeon, gave the opinion that the dlscolorutions
and the scales were the symptoms of a skin affection called
lchthyosis.
The dead man was not more than 25 or 30 years old, was
five feet five tall and weighed about 145 pounds.
thirds were tn favor of the park extension.
If It were token to-day that same vote
Â»"u!d *how many more In favor of every
projected improvement. This campaign has
brought out every possible argument, and
yr.u are all educated up to a point of th#
highest Intelligence. Nothing now remains
for you but to do your duty.
Irving M. Scott said he wanted to use
all the influr>nr<- (m pewewnd In helping
to bring down San Francisco's great park
to the cent) r f the city. Be said:
This great State opened with the gold age.
Thei. agricultural aÂ£e, the com
!!.â  p-ial a;-p, the speculative age and all the
tlrtie the city was growing great, and .now
we come to a point when we must make our
municipality attractive. Of all the
Â« faith that was taken from our marvelous
mines, but little was teft In this State. It
was mostly taken away and San Francisco
suffered. Hut that great demoralizing
stock-Jobbing period has passed away, and
we have long resumed our normal OMdtUoB.
We alj remember the franchise crate, when
nearly every privilege of value on our streets
waÂ» given away, and which led ultimately .
to thÂ» agitation ending In our new charter.
In this now law is contained every provision
that can procure for you. If you want them,
every Institution that you support with roar
money and which we require In our dally
llf.-.
N w, then, having- done this, we are free
to look around and Improve our city. The
bonds that U Is proposed t0 t fftsue try a <jj.
rect benefit, no matter from which point you
view It. This Is now the people's age. WÂ«
have passed the corporation ace and now we.
want to own our city. We have had schools
and sewer* and a hospital since we came
here, but Is It not right that we should have
better? We had streets In '41, but should
. we be content to-<lay with the streets of that
year ?
We have a park, hut It Is like our sewersâ
It has no opening Why should we not have
an lmnrovt-d park? It I-. not a speculation,
but a business project. The Issue Is In your
hands and every city In the country Is
â watching to see whether we are to progress
or to seÂ«s ourselves passed In the race toward
greatness.
Colonel M. Hecht, who promised he
would not speak more than five minutes.
wag the n.-xt speaker. He said:
The questions before us to-night were set
tled on November 7 when you elected Mr.
I fielan for Mayor. He was before you en a
platform of progress and reform, and he
Intends to carry It out If you will let him.
M.all we forever remain a market-place
anrt make money here. and. be forced to go
â w \ork or elsewhere to spend It be
cause we do not care to make our own city
beautiful enough to llv* In? The only oppo
sition I hare heard has been regarding the
cost. Vw, this objection has no merit.
One of the objectors is a multi-millionaire
whom I have known for thirty years, and
the only time I have ever Â«em his name to
a document has been when it was on a re
ceipt for money or on a protest against a
public Improvement The feeble opposition
does not amount to anything, and. had the
campaign lasted much loncer. It would
probably have Imported men from New Jer
sey to have told us our duty In the premise*.
Here Is an opportunity to pull together for
once, and. for God's sake, let us net to
gether for once. I have not any destre to
be personal, but I think our platform to
night outnumbers the members of the organ
ized opposition by at least twenty to one.
If this question only required a majority we
would not be here, because It would be safe;
but It requires a two-thin.- vote, and we
must see that it l.Â« obtained.
E. A. Denlcke said that thirty years
ago he heard the same story In regard
to Golden Gate Park that he can near
to-day In regard to the panhandleâ that
we don't need It and It costs too much.
He said:
How true Is this of Oolden Gate Park.
After thirty years the land that MS* Â»*<Â».-
Cjo can now be sold fiÂ»r JU.000.000. That
settles the matter of whether It coat too
much, and I do not think any Intelligent
person needs to be asked In JS9J whether
It was needed. Th* same is true of the
panhandle. In a few year* It will have paid
for Itself many times over. Why has Oak
land been built up? Simply because the
people who now live there have been J riven
away from San FrancUco because of Its

Grand Jury Files its
Report.
PRAISE FOR CITY OFFICIALS
BAD JAKITOR SEBVICE IN THE
CITY HAiL.
In its report filed last evening? with Pre
siding Judge Daingerfleld o f the Superior
Court the Grand Jur>\ recognizing tho
existing ..".....- of the telephone company
end the many inconveniences to which a
lor.g-suXerlng public has been compelled
to tul-mit owing to tho exasperating tac
tics of Its employes, recommended the
abolishment of thÂ« nlckel-ln-the-slot at
tachments to telephones and the â¢ st.ih
llshment of a flat rate In their stead. Tho
report of the committee on corporations,
consisting of G. T. Gray (chairman). J. P.
McMurray and J. C. Wojf. is as follows:
"Your committee In its Investigation of
the telephone system In this city was
fhown throufih tho different operating de
jtartmrnts of tho I'aciflc Telephone and
Telegraph Company, on Bu^h street. It
was pointed out to us ho\\ the Signals
were Riven to the operator St the time the
i.'ik., v. ...- deposited In the slot. This sig-
Dal being a flash of light, which is Instan
taneous, we could readily t r ee how the op
erator might have her attention attracted
in some other way and thereby miss tha
tlgnal. and undoubtedly a great deal of
Â«.:.-..::.::.<â¢ ::i.:i Is caused in this manner,
together with tho fact that the boxes will
get out of order, as^admitted by the of
:.â¢!>. In talking with the latter we could
B*t no satisfaction out of them In refer
ence to any remedy for this evil, and
your committee wuuld recommend that
the teleplionr company be required to give,
fiat rates instead of using the nlckel-m-
Ihf-cioi telephone, as there Is no doubt in
our minds that a flat rate Is the only sat
isfactory way of giving the public good
fccrvice."
The committee which investigated the
Police Department, police patrol and City
I'rifKjn Mates that Us duty, thanks to the
klndnes and rflurtwy of Chief of Police
l.< . h. was made a great pleasure. The
report says:

tor by reason of the c&pable individuals
composing li and the noble work performed
by them.
Two reports were filed on the bo called
"social evil." The majority report, signed
by Jurors Wright. Kuddlck and Jacobs,
6tates that the evil has been scattered all
over the city. in some places more public
than others, and they recommend thai It
be. collected In one locality and shut in
from view of the public. This committee
also finds that the dives and dance halls
are conducted in an orderly manner.
The minority report is signed by Jurors
Gray and Drydeml, who state that they
: in.- "opposed to any attempt at the regu
lation of the 'social evil" whereby there is
any attempt to legalize the same." He
' garding dives and dance halls, they hold
that no particular good results from thttn.
The conduct of the Mayor's office was
found to be methodical and in the interest
' of the public welfare.
The other reports are, in part, as fol
low:
The Treasurer's office Is in a most cred
itable condition, every branch being con
ducted in a business-like manner. The va
lioua funds and special deposits have been
consolidated and where It took the Com
nitEElonvra several hours to count the coin
the work can now be accomplished In a few
minutes. We are convinced that no de
partment in the city government Is being
better conducted than the Treasurer's'de
partment.
Chief b'ulllvan of the Fire Department Is
especially commended for the high class
of excellence and efficiency to . which ho
has brousht the PlrÂ« Department.
The appropriation of U.tuO.OOO for the sup
port of the public schools for the present
Qscal year is Inadequate to pay Ealarleu,
furnish necersaiy supplies and make re
pairs Imperatively demanded. The present
board has conducted Us affairs in quite a
satisfactory manner.
The books and records or the Coroner's
office are kept in order, as are also tho
books of the police court clerks and prop
erty clerk.
We find nothing to criticize in the County
Clerk's office, either in 'respect to the. man
agement of the office or the ability of the
attaches. Under the administration of Mr.
Deane "Jury stuffing" has become a thing
of the past. An Important innovation Is
the justification of sureties on different
bonds.
In reference to the water and gas com*
pani- we know that the rates of both are
considerably (her than other cities and
we recommend that when bonds are being
issued for the general Improvement of the
city that some be Isnued for these utilities.
The Tax Collector's and Licence Col
lector's offices were found to be conducted
properly. A detailed examination of the
books, however, we found to be Imprac
ticable, as It would be necessary to obtain
the services of experts, which Is not within
our province.*
Of the office of Assessor Dodge we can
only t-;*ak in commendation. In the mat
ter of the collection of poll taxes the same
customs of past years have been followed.
As the new charter specifically provides
that all commissions and fee* of salaried
officers shall be turned Into the treasury
dally all local disputes as to whom they
shall be paid will be definitely settled.
The Sheriff's books and records appear
to be In every way satisfactory. The con
dition of the jail buildings require Im
mediate mid careful overhauling. On ac
count of the abominable Janitor service In
this office and throughout the City Hall
we are constrained to ask why Is the city
;m> Ing for Janitors and receiving no work
In mum. We would suicgest that here
after each elective officer be allowed a cer
tain sum to keep his office In a tidy con
dition
We recommend the placing of Incandes
cent lights In the Recorder's office; that
books be numbered and rebound and that
necessary book racks be provided.
A great deal of praise Is due to Registrar
Ptepi>urher for the prompt discharge of his
duties during the last election and for the
splendid condition of the records in his
effle*.
Everything in and about the Almhouse
was running In systematic order when the
committee visited It.
In regard to the Supervisors we find that
the reprehensible hnbtt of selecting thÂ«
street light fund to come to the aid of the
depleted treasury Is worthy of severe cen
sure. ThÂ« city is plunged In total dark
ness for a period, exposing Its citizens to
the ravages of the criminal element on that
account. The system of political Janitors
Is foisted upon the people that party work
ers may be rewarded and It is Impossible
to get these gentry to even make an effort
to earn their salaries.
We would also recommend that the Board
of Supervisor* pay more nttcntlcn to the
recommendations of the Auditor relative to

Said to Have Violated
Election Laws.
Special Plspatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 22â William H.
Bradley, a former captain of police, but
BOW engaged in the hack business, to-day
brought a formal accusation ajtainst
Mayor-elect Clark, charging him with
I violations of the purity of elec

Among other things It Is alleged that A.
â th. Clark's business partner, while
acting for the candidate, paid the contest
ant $2o for the use of two hacks on ciÂ«o
tion day, which item does not appear m
his official statement. The contestant de
clares his belief that Clark paid out $200
in hire for hacks used on election day,
which is not set forth in the official state
ment filed by the candidate. The contest
ant further alleges that Clark. f<>r the
purpose of aiding his election as IC&jror,
MM to William M. Sim;", chairman of tha
Republican Committee, the sum of
HMD, and that for the same purpose Sims
paid to B. W. Cavannugh $300 of th# said
Fum. to Frank Dsmux |400 and to B \V
Cavanaugh. for Frank Farrar, $150. and
that none of thflM sum? appear Jn the offi
cial stntement. It is further averred, on
information and belief, that defendant
emplcyM Win. J. I>nvis to prepare for
publication the record of Clark'9 oppo
nent. R. D. Stephens, in the- Legislature,
for which Davis reoelrÂ«d $2", which dow
nit appear in thÂ« statement. It is alleged
also that defendant paid GÂ«Â»org*Â» P. Roys
ter $50 and offered him a position in the
event of his election; that Wilbur F.
Smith was also offenvi a position, con
trary to the provisions of the purity of
elections law.
Slay aski that Clark's election be set
asidf and his certificate canceled. Judge
Johnson has set the matter for January
It. ami v number of witnesses have been
snbpenned.

WANT PAY FOR OVERTIME.
Finance Committee Considers Peti-
tion of Tax Office Clerks.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors yesterday considered a peti
tion of the clerks in the bookkeeper's de
partment of the Tax Collector's office in
which thÂ«y request that their claims be
allowed f'Â»r extra services rendered both
before and after regular office hours from
October 11 to December 20 of this year.
The claims aggregate $1837 SO, and about
a dozen clerks desire the extra compen
sation in Mims ranging from $S7 50 to $125.
Bookkeeper Magulre appeared before
the committee and stated that during the
busy time in the Tax Collector's office
he and his assistants were obliged to
work from S o'clock in the morning until
12 o'clock at night in addition to Sundays
and holidays. On the day previous to the
taxes becoming delinquent several of the
force were kept at work all night lon*
checking up tne various payments ana
he thought they were entitled to the extra
pay for overtime.
The committee was of the opinion that
there were no funds that could be made
available for the purposes requested, but
a conference will be held with the Auditor
after the opinion of City Attorney Lane
had first been obtained as to the legality
of the claims.
REV. DR. CARSON'S WILL VOID.
Decedent's Widow Asks for Letters
of Administration on His Estate.
Mrs. Ida L. Carson made application
yesterday for letters of administration
upon the estate of her late- husband.
Rev. Alexander L. Carson, at one time
pastor of Trinity Presbyterian Church.
The deceased left a will, but as It is
olngraphlc and is nut written entirely in
th*Â» hr.nd of the testator, the address and
a portion of the date being printed. It is
void, and hence the eÂ«tat* must be ad
ministered as though the deceased had
died intestate. In his will the deceased
pastor says:
I have strurtled hard all my life to mak*
both hippy and comfortahle tho#e dependent
upon ma. and to do my duty as a Christian min
ister, both to God and the people he hath per
mitted mÂ« to save. I have the best and the
dearest wife that God could possibly Klve to
any man. and I love her with all the tenderness
and affection of a heart that loves even to the
death. I have a son whom I love as my own
ilfe, and who. I trust, will make a noble, useful
man; and how I wish I mirht be able ta provide
more liberally for both or them!
Deceased leaves an estate valued at
$8866, which he devises to his widow and

WOULD FORM II
TRUST IN TILES
UNO MANTELS
The Cause of an Im
portant Decision.
JUDGE MORROW INTERFERES
A MANUFACTURERS' COMBINA
TION BROKEN.
Â» â 
Considerable attention was devoted by
lawyers to the recent decision of the Su
j preme Court of the- United States aga'nst
I the Addyston Pipe Company. It wad a
decision that dealt -with the- anti-trust
law and on that account commanded no
tice, but it Is not thÂ» only decision of its
kind. On November 13 last Judge Mor
row of the United States Circuit Court
rendered a similar decision applying to a
local trust which, under the ruling of the
court, bids fair to be a thing of the past.
I The particular trust referred to in
Judge Morrow's decision is an organiza
tion of the tilt-makers In several cities of
the country making it Impossible for the
plaintiff to buy tiles without coming into
the combination and then, by the pecu
liarities of Its by-laws, making it impos
sible for Mm to come in.
The action was brought by the flnr. of
liowry m Daly against the Tile. Mantel
and Grate Association and all its mem
bers It Â«A alleged by tne plaintiff that
the defendants had banded themselves to- :
gether for the purpose of checking legit
imate competition^ for the raining of
prices and for the monopolizing of the
trade in their particular commodities.
They would not sell to the plaintiffs nor
would they buy from them and It was im
possible for them to buy tiles anywhere
but at factories controlled by the c m
bination on account of. the freight ratC3.
And all orders which the plaintiffs had
placed with the defendants just prior to
the organization of the trust were can
celed as -ioon as the organization had ot>en
completed. The combination was formed
in January of IS9S. . Up to that time the
plaintiffs nad been pursuing a lucrative
but not a large business, but as soon as
the combination was effected their busi
! ness went from them. They could not get
into the combinationâ first, because tne
by-laws required a unanimous vote, .md
the plaintiffs had enemies and business
rivals in the combination which always
prevented the necessary unanimity: and
again, because the combination took no
notice of the firms that did not carry a
stock worth at least $5000. and the plain
tiff did not carry that amount.
The object of the action was to secure
damages amounting to 130.000, three times
the amount of the actual damage the
plaintiffs claimed had been done them
This is !n accordance with the anti-trust
law. The defendants demurred to Ihe
complaint, among other things .on the
ground that it did not state facts stiitl
dent for a cause of action, thereby bring
ing the merits of the case at issue under
th.> demurrer, and this demurrer Judge
Morrow overruled.
In his decision Judge Morrow holds that
such an agreement as that which bound
the tilemakers was clearly illegal under
the anti-trust law. both from Its nature
and from the fact that It impeded traf
fic between States. He based his decision
on the decision of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Sixth District in the
case of the Addyston Pipe Company, ,the
same case afterward affirmed by the
United States Supreme Court In the last
decision published. 'Judge Morrow also
referred to his own decision In the case
against the coal dealers, In which be held
that an agreement somewhat similar was
illegal. In rendering his opinion in ;tiat
case, which at the time was freely com
mented upon by the newspapers, he out
lined what agreements were within the
artti-trust statutes. Much of his reason
ing In that case appears In the Addyston
case before the higher- courts.
It was contended by the defendant tile
makers that rome such agreement as they
had entered into was nec< ssary to seccre
to them their business, as competition
between them was destroying their trade
altogether; but Judge Morrow held that
their combination hindered much more
than It helped trade.
The defendants named as forming the
Tile. Mantel and Grate Association are
the Columbia Encaustic Tile Company of
Indiana. he United States Encaustic Tile
Works -Â»f Indiana, the Cambridge Tile
Manufacturing Company of Kentucky
the Plttdburg Tile Company of Pennsyl

fornia and Burnette & Schutte and Hea
vener A Meir, for which no locations were
given. .
The plaintiffs. I.owry & Daly, are lo
cated in this city. .
The course of the case will now be
short ' In 'he lower United â¢ States court
A short hearing as to whether or not
damage was really done the plainMlfs
will be sufllclent to sustain a Judgment
It Is certain to be carried higher, how
ever, if !t be possible, after Judge Mor
row has finished, with it.

XI. THE SCIENCE OF COOKERY.
In the strictest sense cookery Itself mny
not be a science. l>ut behind lta processes
lie the principles of many sciences. t'l.-m
istry. physics, botany and bacterlol >k>'
all play their part In the preparation of
the food we eat.
We can hardly overestimate the Impor
tance of chemistry in the Kitchen. t>ut
hitherto in the study of foods It often has
been given an undue promlr.ence while
other sciences have been neglected. Or
ganic chemistry is so complex that as
yet the best chemists are unwilling to
give us many positive statements atvit
foods and the transformation which UMJT
undergo in digestion, and whlie a single
food material may be studied with C Ns>
parative cast, complications arise from
the combination of our modern menus.
Many changes once attributed to chemi
cal action are now found to be caused by
bacteria. .
Many household processes can be used
to Illustrate science study In the schools
and the principles which are learned there
may be applied at home. Physics teaches
us the laws of fire and water upon which
changes of matter mainly deptr.d. With
out heat and moisture cookery would bÂ«
Impossible, and the laws that rule those
forces are the same In the kitchen as
elsewhere. We must leani that heated
matter expands; that substances in fine
particles or in solution change form more
rapidly than they could do otherwise;
that water is constantly changing its
place under the Influence of heat; tha* at
sea level !t boils at a fixed temperature
(212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 dagMW
centigrade) and cannot then be made not
ter under ordinary' conditions.
The upward tendency of heated air
gives the clew to the most mysterious ar
rangements of dampers and draughts in
a kitchen range. The contraction and ex
pansion of different metals and their
ways of transmitting heat have a direct
bearing upon the chemical changes which
take place in foods cooked in different
utensils.
Bright new tin reflects heat and is best
suited to baking in gas and kerosene
ovens where the heat below Is intense;
the blackened tin or sheet iron absorlxt
heat and should be used where an oven
does not bake well at the bottom. A
knowledge of the range of temperature
required for cooking common foods is
indispensable to the housekeeper who
would feed her family properly.
The mechanical effects of heat and cold
are also important. Gelatin sometimes
perplexes the cook by refusing to ha- 1- r.
properly. This may be due to som* fer
ment or harterlai action, bat is more often
the result of a too high degree of tem
perature. Once try this experiment and
the thing is plain: Strain a coffee or lem
on Jelly into several small molds, hm
one In a warm place, put another in a
pan of cold water, a third In a dish of
cracked ice and surround a fourth with
ice and oalt. The last hardens rapidly and
if left long enough will freeze, as th<*
temperature of the Ice and salt will bÂ«
considerably below the freezing point.
The others will cool more slow
the first will not begin to harden for a
long time.
The use of oil In salad dressings and of
butter and kindred fats In pastry and
cakes if> also subject to the lawn of heat
and cold. Any dough to be rolled thin,
like cookies or piecrust, should be very
o>ld. A thermometer with wide range of
temperature Is a useful kitchen appliance.
Economic botany teaches us the tlm^s
and seasons of plant fo ids. and the like
ness of members of the came families of
plants. Molds and yeasts, their IsftMtl
and effects upon food substances, must
be studied by the methods of the botanist.
Some knowledge of the new science of
bacteriology Is essential for the guardian
of cellar and refrigerator. This science
Is associated not only with the ever-pres
ent dust and all the danger arising from
it but also with the prepuratlon and pres
ervation of foods. The souring of milk,
the flavor of butter, the ripening of
cheese, fruit cakes and mince pies. thÂ«
spoiling of canned goods and the decay
of fruits, vegetables and meats are all
due primarily to the micro-organisms
known as bacteria.
bringing hit knowledge gained through
many patient experiments to the aid of
the housewife, the bacteriologist tells her
that clean foods keep better than dirty
ones; that sterilization, which consists of
subjecting any substance for a sufficient
tlm* to the temperature of boiling water,
or. better still, to a higher point by dry
heat or superheated steam, will render
suspected water or food comparatively
harmless.
Because most bacteria do their work
more easily in liquids, concentrated or
drier substances are more easily pre
served. Fruit Juices In the form of jellies
rendered solid with sugar require less
protection than fruits with liquid Juices;
the latter must not only be thoroughly
sterilized but also kept In air-tight Jars.
The consumer sometimes objects to the
change In form and color often caused by
a high degree of heat, hence the profes
sional food packers frequently use certain
chemicals to retard bacterial action. The
use of preservatives and chemical colors
and flavors Is a serious question at thÂ«
present time. Few housekeepers have the
time, knowledge or appliances for food
analysis, but all can take suspected arti
cles to the local or State Board of Health.
It takes a well trained chemist to detect
fraud, and legal authority to fight It.
Fortunately, most of the common adul
teration of, food is what Is termed sophis
tication, or the substitution of a harmless,
cheap substance for a more costly one.
Every purchaser should be sufficiently
familiar with food values to recognize
the Impossibility of selling the real arti
cle* at the prices for which they are
sometimes offered.
The. principal chemical changes which
take place In food while cooking may bo
descrioed in .1 few words, but before this
can be done the foods must be classified.
The substances . Jr. all foods may be
grouped under five divisionsâ water, min
eral matter, proteid, fat and carbohy
drates. TIM substances are combined
in varying proportions in foods or nat
ural form as well a* in the compounds of
the cook.
Charts have been published by the
United States Government which explain
this classification and shew the composi
tion of common foods.
Water is the universal carrier of solid
substances throughout the human system
as it is over tht surface of the earth.
Mineral matter Is found in all foods In
minute quantities and is essential for
bone building.
Proteid is considered necessary for mus
cle-making. It Is obtained from the mus
cle of meats, the gluten TÂ»f grains, etc.
Fat Is primarily a fuel food and Is of
both .mirr.al and vegetable origin.
Carbohydrates include starches, sugars
and various gummy substances; like fats,
they are fuel foods, but In less degree.
Chemists have #yen us formulas fo.
the right proportion of these food princi
ples for different ages and conditions of
mankind. Before these formulas can be
transformed Into satisfactory ' food, the
art of cookery must be recognized. As
Count Rumford said. "Much more de
pend* upon the art and skill of the cook
than upon the bsjsjm laid out In the mar*
Â£m Thls art ls a combination of the
skill of our grandmothers, nnd -he science
of modern chemists. As John RuskJn him
said. '-It means the knowledge of all
herbs and fruits an'! halms and spices:
and of all that l.i healing and sweet in
fields and proves and savory In meats; It
means carefulness and inventiveness and
watchfulness and readiness of appliance."
To summarize what has already been
Bald, the science of cookery means a
knowledge of the composition of foods.
and the way in which they are affected
by fire and water.
Let M take some of the carbohydrates
a? an example. Place a cupful of sugar
with an equal amount of water In a small
Iron frying-pan upon the stove and watch
its changes. The sugar dissolves, forms
â  syrup which gradually becomes thicker
by the evaporation of the water. When
the water is gone the sugar forms In
lumps, then gradually melts into a golden
syrup, which become? darker and darker
until a bubble of charcoal Is left. If we
catch It at the right stage of brownness,
and add water again, the result Is a syrup
of agreeable flavor, such as to found In
the golden-brown crust of pies, puddings
and cakes. The rich color and flavor In
the crust of bread and Its digestibility ls
due to a similar change In starch. Thus
we may see that a high temperature does
not injure this group of food substances.
The woody fiber In vegetables, which Is
closely allied to starch and sugar, needs
all the heat which can be transmitted to
them by water to make them digestible.
Even if long continued, the heat of boll-
Ing water, 212 degrees Fahrenheit, is not
sufficient to make certain vegetable sub
stances either digestible or palatable.
On the other hand, the albuminous por
tions of vegetables, the muscle of meat
and the albumen of eggs is rendered
harder and less easy of digestion by In
tense heat. Any reliable cook book will
show us how by mechanical agencies
Juices and flavors are retained, and at
the same time the bulk of the fibers of
meat are not allowed to be overheated.
The outKlde of a Joint of meat hi sprink
led with flour and put Into a hot oven,
which coagulates th* Juices on the out
side quickly, making a coating which pre
vents the escape of Juices when the tem
perature of the oven hi lowered. or when
water is the medium of cooking, after a
few moments of rapid boiling to harden
the outside, the kettle Is put where it will
keep below the boiling point, that thÂ«
meat may be tender and yet hold together
in neat slices when carved. But the
boiled meat will part with some of Its
Juices because of the wonderful power of
water to pick up and carry oft part of
everything with which It comes In con
tact. Upon this characteristic depend*
the power of cleaning and Its capacity for
making solutions and Infusions of tea.
coffee, meats and vegetables. Fat can bo
raised to a higher temperature than wa
ter, and if properly used is a suitable me
dium for cooking certain foods.
The making doughs light by the use of
acids with soda and alkaline substances
Is a distinctly chemical process. What
ever acid Is used It must be combined
with the soda in exact portions, so that
a neutral substance I* formed an. no par
ticle of either left behind. Cream of tar
tar is usually considered the best acid
substance for this purpose, because the
new material which results Is !rsÂ«Â» harm
ful than that which Is formed from thÂ»
union of some other acids with soda.

SUNDAY SCHOOL CONVENTION.
Executive Committee Meets and
Others Are Appointed to Ax
range Matters.
The executive committee of the North
California Sunday School Association held
a meeting In the Young Men's Christian
Association room's yesterday afternoon.
State President Charles M. Campbell cf
Sacramento presided. General Secretary
Earl S. Blngham of San Jose presented

ciation to impress upon the members their
obligation to their religion. Tha report
showed that twenty-nine conventions had
been visited and addressed, and 4000 miles
traveled since the last report. The work
is In a prosperous condition, the conven
tions being attended by not less than ICO
delegates each. AlameÂ«la County has hud
a house to house canvass, and Fresno,
Tulare and Sacramento will have soon.
Preparations were made for the State
convention, which is to be held In Ban
Jose in April. The committee tÂ« expert-

EASTERN MARKETS. !
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 22.-Tbe stock market had
to undergo further liquidation to-day. Prices
yielded without any very active resistance,
but there were no signs of panic a- the
liquidation was conducted In an orderly man
ner. The principal causes cf weakness were
evidently not local and seemed- to be largely
due to the condition of lairs In Boston. The
closing of the Globe National Bank there was
the cause of widespread uneasiness and
brought large offerings on the New York mar
ket of th* favorite Boston stocks. Sugar was
the most conspicuous example, as la shown by
its extreme decline of 7 points. This stock was
under very heavy pressure all day on rumors
of a continuation of the trade war as well as
on the forced selling for Boston account. Bur
lington. Federal Hlwl and Atchlson preferred
wrre also sold from Boston. London was a
large seller of stocks In this market and the
deprmsion there Â«"xerclsÂ«rd a large sentimental
Influence. The riÂ«Â» in the private discount rate
asd the fears of trouble at' the settlement are
now Imminent caum-s of apjirehenbiun. Some
of the favorite International stocks were acute
ly depressed from time to time, notably New
York Central. St. Paul. l!alttmore and Ohio
preferred. Missouri Pacific. Reading first pre
ferred and I>enver and Rto Grande preferred.
The bears were energetic . curators all day
and suj-plememeil their efforts by the circu
lation uf some Â«-xtravagar.t rumors regarding
ihe financial condition of various houses and
properties. The effect en some of the trust
companies was to indue* large calling of loans
as a nieasun* of 1 rt- rautt^n against any ex
traordlnHry demands that might be made upon
tLem. The rumor- mor.gerlng of the bears was
â¢>.- flagrant in some canes as t.. cause the dia
cuÃnion by some of those who were the great
â¢rt rufTt-rers of legal trearures directed against
the oCT.ders. During the last hour the 1-nis
Â»tÂ» very large buyers to cover shurt con
tracts and the effect on prices was m-n in
reooveries running all the way from 1 to 5
point* in the prlnc!jÂ«l railroad* and Indus
trials. As a n-^u'.t r.et losses were reduced
within a rang* o; 3 points except in ii few
tncr.nsplcuous stocks. Â«!:!â¢ i> had i..'. moved
previously during the week. A numUr of
â¦â tocks. including those which have rnJTered
most f*verely durir.g the week are tightly
above last night's level. The rata far money
flurried at one time to X p*T cent, but ruled
for the mast part at Â«or lielow. Estimate* of
to-njcrroWn liar.k ttatemrnt are all at tea
fv. !:.c to the extraordinary conditions that
have prevailed. The hanka have gained on the
regular interior movement, but the extraor
dinary demand from Boston has offset that. '

Bradstreet 's Financial Review.
NEW YORK. Dec. 22.â Bradstreefs financial
review to-morrow will say:
Wall street at the end of last week was be
ginning to think that speculative liquidation
had run its course and that unfavorable money
market condition! here and abroad had ex
hausted their effect. This optimism, however,
was quickly overturned by a series of disturb
ing events.
A severe British reverie. In South Africa,
which demoralized the London markets and
rendered large withdrawals or gold from New
York to that city more probable, was the first
of the series. This was followed by develop
ments Indicating that the financial" and busi
ness complications at Boston might have fur
ther consequences. Finally a New York in
ptitutiun-the Produce Exchange Trust Com
which had been the object of an un
tavorable rumor, was actually closed on Mon
day. In the sensitive and nervous condition
of speculation of the money market the last
development was all that was needed to start
a vary pronounced liquidation. In fact at
times, on last Monday the combination of ex
treme rates for money and of the selling
which Indicates that holders were dropping
n.K-ks and brokers selling out their cuÃtom
erÂ».' accounts, regardless of intrinsic values
produced an Impression akin to a panic It
seems that some Institutions called loans rather
Indiscriminately, and that In many cases
lenders renewed their disposition to reject la
.luftriiil collateral with iiltle regard to prices
The call loan rate, therefore, quickly rose to
50 and 100 per cent, and finally to as high as
IH6 per cent. The proposition of the Secretary
of the Treasury to give relief by lncrea*lnn
the clovernment deposits In the banks did not
at first find favor with the street, which had
been led to expect that Mr. Oage would call
for tenderi for a large amount of bonds. The
excitement, in fact, was not allayed until a
I group of leading New York banks made a
; i .ml.matlon and loaned $10. '-00,000 on call at
the stock Exchange, their action promptly re
ducing the current rate to 6 per cent.
During the last hour on Monday, when the
market had become fairly demoralized and
active, stocks had declined from 6 to IS points
and seemed likely to go still lower, confidence
was restored and prices recovered. The tran
sactions on Monday, rising to over 1 6uO 000
sl.ures. would indicate the activity and ex
citement which reigned, while the fact that
in many cases the lowest prices of the year
were touched Is significant as to the severity
of the break. Only one failure occurred on
the Stock Exchange. By Tuesday the un
lavoranle rumors which usually spring up at
such tlmeÂ« had been Mfted tlown and no Im
mediate dangers could be detected Lonlon
had also partially regained Its courage and
on this side the associated banks of the
metropolis took steps to check any neÂ«dlesi
demoralization. Their most Important steps
were to form a combination to lend $15 doo wio
on the market and to facilitate the Increase
of deposits of Internal revnu* receipts I
the national banks. It is stated that on Tues
day some $:..C'O.<vy) was turned over to the
banks In this way. while the high rateg (or
at New York apparently attracted
money from the Interior. There wai conse
qmntly a general nnd rather sharp recovery
on Tuesday, but on Wednesday an Irregular
continuance of this movement was checked by
a br.-ak of some 13 points in the price of
Brooklyn Transit and by the engagement of
$500,000 more gold for export, the market al
together neglecting such an Important devel
opment as the Increase of thÂ» New York Cen
tral dividend putting the stock on a 6 per cent
basis. <>n Tharodajr. In Â»plte of the compara
1 tive eaae of looey, the market was henvv
; and at times decl.lr.lly weak. The elements
! which on that day assumed prominence were
i the ailed"', tlanger of further eevere liquida
tion In London and the preparations which
the exchange here plainly indicated for heavy
1 gold shipments to-day. Nor did the street fall
|to remark the strength of the Continental
1 money markets or the advance In the official
! rates of the hanks of Germiny and France
; Though the Bank of England made no change
In It* figures, the London open market figures
for illsiount were up to 6% per cent, and all
the Indications were that the strain which thÂ«
January paytreatM put on the foreign financial
: center would be of a serious if not dangerous
character, which could hardly fall to have
â  Its reflection here.
Bradstreefs on Trade.
, . 1
NEW YORK. Dec Bradstreefi Â«tate
ment of trade to-morrow will say: Holiday
trade activity of course reaches tv highett de
velopment during the week now drawing to
a clone and it is significant -of the prosperous
condttlone underlying the general business
â Ituatlon that reports, almost without excep
tion, point to a volume of business having few
If any parallels In previous years. Another
significant feature developed also is that the
demand for ouch goods embraces a higher class
ana a more expensive grade of materials, a
conclusion among trade reporters being that
a larger buying capacity exists now than in
any previous year in the country's history,
inls favorable condition, too, exist* In face
i. th * fact tn Â«" weather conditions have not
altogether favored retail distribution of winter
goods, the result being less activity In purely
retail lines than had been looked for. though
comparisons with one year ago are generally
favorable.
Wholesale trade at tola season usually shows
a quieting tendency, but It Is questionable
whether this tendency Is as marked thla year
as in former periods. To the advanced stage
of the season chiefly and perhaps also to the
sentimental effect growing out of stringent
money conditions in speculative lines may be
charged some of the quietness noted. As above
Intimated, however, thii Is less marked than
in preceding years. Just how much Influence
upon current bank clearings has been exercised
by money market development and what effect
anticipations of Interest payments on January
1. estimated to aggregate $100,000,000. have had
upon bank clearings It would be hard to etate
accurately.
Prices generally have shown exceptional
strength, the great majority of staple quota
tions remaining unchanged as a result of the
weeks operations. As exceptions to this might
be Instanced flour, pork, coffee and lead, which
are higher, while copper, cotton and tin are
lower. War news and tight money combined
caused a slump early In the week In cotton,
but the close found prices of the actual staple,
spot cotton, only slightly below the opening.
The Interior movement of cotton has failed to
expand, and there are evidences that foreign
buyers covered heavily at the decline.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 2.817.714 bushels, against 3.258.
640 bushels last week. 8.615.231 bushels In the
corresponding week of li? 8. 4.577,559 bushels In
1*97; 2.111.702 bushels in 1896, and 3,457,991
bushels In 1895.
Plnce July 1. this season, the exports of
wheat aggregate 100.J78.640 bushels, against
11.'.. :?<â .. CR4 bushels last year and 123.556.756
bushels In- 1897-93.
Business failures are fewer than ordinarily
nt this season, though exceptional money con
ditions caused some few heavy embarrass
ments, and the liabilities will swell the
month's total considerably. The total num
ber of embarrassments this week is 211 as
compared with 211 last week, 212 In this week
a year ago and 280 In 1897.
Canadian failures for the week number 29,
as compared with 28 last week. 34 in this
week a year ago and SO In 1897.
Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK. Dec. 22.â R. G. Dun & Com
pany's weekly review of trade will say to
morrow: The worst day In Wall street for
many years was In part the legitimate result
of the best year In business ever known be
cause the country has prospered sj greatly
and had so expanded Its business that It could
no longer afford to have many millions locked
up In carrying stocks representing Imaginary
values. The question was not one of monetary
supply. When the country found ample use
for Its capital . In regular trade and productive
Industry a contraction of loans became neces
sary, which would only have been more pain
ful If the volume of stocks had been larger.
Reckoning from the highest general average
last spring during last year Industrial stocks
had fallen at the close on Monday 23.27 per
cent, street railroad stocks 38.90 per cent .and
other railroad and telegraph stocks only 6.70
per cent. â¢â¢ â¢
The business of 'the country close to the holi
days Is necessarily smaller than It has been
and yet : larger than at the same date In any
other .year. Exchanges through the principal
clearing-houses for the week have been 33.7
per cent larger than last year and 50.4 per
cent larger than In 1892. Including 32.1 per
cent gain In payments outside New York.
There was not even a suspicion of uneoundness
In any considerable branch of â¢ Industry or
trade, the extraordinary expansion In some
being as well warranted as the material gain
In others. - -
Cotton suffered In speculation for a day with
.stocks, but the great decrease -In receipts from
farms â¢ since September, over 1, 500.000 bales.
gives strong support to prices, as does the in
crease of 200.M0 hales In takings by spinners.
The demand for goods is quiet and the price
.holds steady. â¢ â¢ :.â¢ â¢
Wool sales have, dropped â  sharply with mone
tary pressure, but prices do not' change and
the opening In ' heavyweight goods retards at
present purchases for mills.
Yielding appears at last In hides at Chicago
in most kinds about one-quarter of a cent, with
evidence that .recent advances could not be
sustained. " Leather has been steady for hem
lock and other sole, but In satin, grain and
kid the demand has fallen off suddenly.
High prices for Iron are wonderfully sus
tained, and though many works will close for
stock taking and the holidays, while the fur
naces do not stop, pig. shows no weakness.
Prices on finished products change little,
though more concerns have reached the point
of competing for new orders and there Is
some weakness In sheets because many tin
plate mills are to be closed soon at the East
and In plates not of .the largest size compe
tition Is sharp, but In bars the demand Is
somewhat Improved and structural works have
continued their combination for another year
without change In prices.
There has been less violent fluctuation In
the London market for tin, but the closing
price here Is slightly lower at 24\c. Copper
declined little In spite of weak stocks at Bos
ton, while lead Is scarce and firmer at 4 Me.
Wheat has fallen both In foreign demand and
In prices In spite of still greater loss In West
ern receipts, for the week only 3.306.256 bushels,
Against 7.340.170 last year. Atlantic exports,
flour Included, have been In three weeks only
6.864.433 bushels, against IS.4U.Ma bushels last
year. The price rose quickly on Monday when
other things were falling, but subsequently
reacted and closed Me lower.
Corn exports are still well maintained, for thÂ»
week 3.728.179 bushels, against 3.824.^36 bushels
last year, though Western receipts have fallen
off. being only 9.404.558 bushels In three weeks,
against 13,470.567 last year.
Failures for the week have been 220 In the
United States, agnlnst C.'.<( last year, and 26 In
Canada, against 31 last year.

for that purpose; of this there Is a moderate

impossible for a year to come at least, as car

LABELS OF BOTTLES FOUND
LOSS OF MONEY AT RACES
CAUSED DOWNFALL.
Strict Silence Observed at the Crellin
Hotel and Mrs. Archer. Mys
terious Guest, Threatens
to Sue for Damages.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Dec. 22.
It developed to-day that M. X. Hart
man. whose death from the effects of
morphine poisoning occurred early this
morning at the, Crellln Hotel, of which he
â â "'â  been proprietor for the past seven
years, was no novice in the use of the
deadly drug. Another label, taken from
a bottle of morphine, was found to-day
In the waste basket In the uead man's
room, and the last bottlo from wnlcn h
death dealing potion had been taken was
found among some collars and linen of
the deceased In a bureau drawer.
Every effort was made last night to
â¢
j shroud Hnrtmans suicide with the mxÂ»
fr>undÂ«ist secrecy, and the employes of the
hotrl have been ur.dor a strict Injunction
of slk-nce. Misses Stella and Anna Hart
man declared to-day that their father
bad not taken his life Intentionally, but
that he probably often sought relief
' through morphine and that he had taken
an overdose. They cite that on his nu
; reau. near the bed, lay his loaded re
volver, and that ha he Intended to Kill
himself he would purely have chosen the
speedier courier of .1 bullet. He had
taKen the drug yesterday shortly after
breakfast, and was found during trie
1 morning hours in a stupor.
j The fact remains, however, that Hart
man during the past year had lost heav
ily on the races.
"Ar-out a year ago i woman. Mrs. a. C
I Archer, took rooms at the CrelUn." .-â¢aid
an acquaintance of the dead man to-day.
I "and she was the owner of several race
horses. She pot Hartman Interested in
the turf, and from that time dated his
financial downfall. Recently Hartman In
corporatrd the Crdlln Hotel Company, he
retaining the controlling Interest. a few
days ago he transferred his entire stock
to his daughters and J. R. Watson, â  min
ing man. who lias been stopping here for
| some time. Just as soon as the hotel
! rami' under the new control orders were
j given not to serve Mrs. Archer at the
, table any longer, nor wait on her wants
;at her room. Now. Mrs. Archer Is sick
: and suffering from nervous prostratl >n.
I She claims she has paid three months'
i rent In advance, hut I guess the book*
j will show the true status. Mrs. Archer
1 has retained an attorney and will orou
| ably sue the hotel company."
j A knock at Mrs. Archer's' rooms brought
her son. Leroy Archer, to the door. "My
, mother Is very ill and does not wish to
be disturbed." is all he would Fay. What
the inquest will bring forth to-mor:o"v

FOUND A WATCH WOUND UP AND GOING IN A TURKEY'S CROP
AI. AM EDA. Dec. 22â Alfred Scott, who. In patrician
society l.s known as "Lord Alfred Scott," and in ple
beian society as plain "Scotty," has had an ex
perianoa with a Christmas turkey the like of
which has never come under the ken of mortal
man. He bought a turkey for Christmas, Intending
tn fatten the bird himself, ami when the turkey was
executed to-day a watch, fully wound and Roing. and
within a few seconds of the right time, was found, and
Scott says that it was not â  prlz<* package bird, either.
Mr. Scott hns a theory In regard to how the watch
ntnfl to be there, and hew it i aine to be goin^. after
th<- turkey had been undergoing the home-fattening imÂ»-
MH for more than v week, and this is the explanation
he makes of that remarkable- fact:
"The turkey undoubtedly swallowed th^ watch, and
it got stuck in the birds crop. Efforts were made t<>
digest the watch aa grains of corn arc- digested, and the
muscular action upon the watch wound it up every day,
for the watch was a stem winder."
Mr. Scott always adds this statement about tho wmteh,
for he is anxious to have the public know that the bird
did not take a key every night and wind the timepiece.

ICE CREAM SODA

NOW FROM GRACE
Causes Dismissal of
Two Students.
OAKLAND. Dec. Hâ And now th.- Ice
Cream Boda Bowl has fallen from grace
into the pale <>f evil Influences and must
henceforth 1Â»> shunned as a rup of inno
cent conviviality. Exuberance not unlike
in consequence to that that lurks in the
festive punch bowl or the deceptive, "high
ball" has been discovered In the fro7.-;i r> -

r BtirrlU, Instructor of mathtmatics
at tho Oakland Hii^h School.
As a result of too freojueni pitations of
the snowy beverage two students danced
the carpel to-day before Principal Mc-
Cbesney for nearly four hours. AftÂ«r ti.o
graduating exercises at the HiKii School
last niÃlu the gravity Â«>f the occasion was
marred by a Select COterie Of students,
whose exhilaration, after they had !>o- n
parading thÂ«- halls of the school building
in lOCkstep and yelling like Carlisle In
dians, led them to adj urn to a local fash
ionable k cream r-iriur. while the stu
dents were partaking <if v. ( . soda bowl
Professor Murriii Â»t< pped In, and his ap
pearance at that moment gave rise to ;â¢"
u|ir"iirlous ovation, sudi as his dignity
had never before experienced. Moreover,
he wat compelled i" respond to a t^a^t.
The morÂ«- serious and less amusing af
termath followed to-day when Principal
McChesney called several of the offenders
up on his ofllce carpet. Tlx- conference
lasted from l till l o clock this afternoon,
and the outcome is th.it Hugh Russell,
one of the students, was finally expelled
and clarence Fredericks was dismissed
Indefinitely, with th<> injunction that hi:;

Boalt & Bishop for the purpose of en
abling Mrs. Hinckley's prosecution of ncr
memorable contest over the estate of the
lnte Thomas H. Blythe. has been com
promised. An order authorizing Mm
Steele to accept the compromise was to
day Issued by Superior Judge Hall on
motion of Attorneys Bishop a: Wheeler
for plaintiff.
The basis of the long-pending suit was
an agreement entered Into on July 15,
ISS9, between E. I* G. Bteele and Janes
Crisp Perry, guardian of the then Flor
ence Blythe. whereby Steele advanced
$10,000 to prosecute her claims us the
natural child and adopted daughter of the
late Thomas H. Blythe. who s supposed
to have died Intestate. Florence Blytiies
hetrshlp was disputed. In April, 1890. the
agreement was so amended that $15.w0
was advanced by Steele, who was to re
ceive back hi money advanced out of the
llrst moneys received by Florence Myth.
from the estate Bteele was also to re
ceive 3 per ctnt of the whole property re
covered for the risk. Some time ago Mrs.
Florence Bl>the Hlnckley won- her l.iK
suit, and Mrs. Steele, as executrix of bet

money advanced.
In January*. IM, Florence Blythe made
written admission of the advancement and
agreed that In return Steele was to get
$7500 of the amount at the rate of 10 per
cent Interest from April 2. 1890, the bal
anceâ $7:VWâ to be repaid, together with auch
other and further sums as that the en
tire amount received shall, with said $7jÂ»j<>,

DR. WOOLSEY IS
ARRESTED FOR
ABUSING HORSE
He Says the Charge
is Spite Work.
OAKXAND, Dec -Dr. E. H. Wooi
sey. one of the best-known physician? In
Alameda County, was arrested to-day on
complaint of Agent O. O. Kennedy of thÂ«
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. The complaint sworn to before
Police Judge Smith charges that the doc
tor '"failed to provide hid horse with
proper food and shelter and protection
from the weather." Dr. Woolaey has been
released on bonds. He has engaged as
counsel to defend him Attorney Etntl
Nusbaumer, who roasted him recently In
the Hodge-Nlckoll breach of promlso
trial, and ho vows that he will fight the
case to a bitter end, though It require thÂ«
expenditure of JIOOO or more. The doc
tor charges Agent Kennedy with attempt
ing to force him into membership in thÂ«
cruelty society, ami that because he
would have nothing to do with the or
ganization Kennedy had him arrested.
Agent Kennedy, on the other hand, asserts
that such prominent people as the Cha
boti called his attention t.i the fact that
Woolsey'i chestnut sorrel saddle horso
has been left In a vacant lot on East Six
teenth street and Second avenue for threa
months, during all the rain and storm,
uncared for and unfed."
"The doctor has discarded the animal."
said Agent Kennedy to-night. "It was
once a good . horse, but he has worn thÂ»
gilt edge "IT and I found the animal lean
in? up against a lone tree on the lot for
support. I have now arrested the doctor
nnd have ordered Councilman Darstow to
furnish the horse with hay at the owner's
expense."
â¢ 'I wouldn't take $200 for that horse."
said Dr. Woolsey to-night. "It's a con
founded outrage that I should be insulted
by this man Kennedy, and I propose to
fight it out oven If It costs JM<Â») and even
if I do have to engage Nusbaumer to de
fend me."

GREAT DANCERS, THE BOERS.
Their Parties Last Twenty-four
Hours, More or Less.
The Boers arc Inordinately fond of
dancing. On the smallest pretext, or nono
at all, they organize what they call a
"dance-ball-party." On the afternoon of
th. prearranged day the "melsjes." or
misses, and the young men roll up from
all the surrounding farms, from a distance
maybe of thirty mil. They come In Capo
carts. In dilapidated "spider*.' on horse
back and In ox wagons. The living room
of the host has been carefully ckared of
Its never superabundant furniture, a few
wooden forma or planks on empty Kin
cases, put around tn.- sides, and a cou
ple of reflecting; paraffin lamps hung oa
the walls.
Th. dancing begins at o In the afternoon
to the music of a concertina played by a
"Cape boy," which la to say a half-col
ored man. Every one appears In or
dinary dress, uncouth, untidy and slouch/
In the extreme. The women almost In
variably wear black, with perhaps a bit
Of colored ribbon. The men are In cor
duroys or <â¢!)<. tweeds, often wearing
their "smasher" hats and shod In heavy
"veldt* â  or boots.
No "square" dances are performed; but
one dance In like anotherâ a slow. Jumpy,
heavy, monotonous whirl, something be
tween an elephantine waltz and â  cum
bersome polka. The girls sometimes* place
their two hands on their partner's shoul
ders and the men clasp the girls' waists
with their two hands.
After â  few hours of serious Jumping
about, the room has to be cleared, for.
the floor being of earth, a terrible duat
it knocked up. and. as the doors and
windows are Invariably closed, the at
mosphere becomes thick with floating
clouds of dust. Every one goes out Into
the stoep and Is refreshed by dOB (BoÂ«r
brandy), lemonade, cookies (cakes) and
sweets.
In the meantime the room Is swept, and
sometimes a calabash of bullock's blood
Is brought In with which the. floor is
smeared by the natives.
Frvm time to timeâ say. every two or
three hoursâ this is repeated, so that In
tervals of dancing, dusty cloudiness, re
freshments on the vcrand.i and smearing
of the floor succeed one another period
ically.
This sort of thing goes on until about
8 In the morning, when every one gets
a bit sleepy. A general adjournment
takes place: the women collect In the
side room, and snatch a few hours' sleep,
and the men He down In the wagon
house, or under their carts on the veldt
to smoke and rest.
At about noon, after a hearty meal,
they b-ctn dancing again until late In
the afternoon. At last they go home af
ter about twenty-four hours of it. and
scatter over the ve'dt to their far distant
homes.â Answers of London.

THE SAN FKANCIfcCO CALL,, SATI'RDAY, DECEMBER 23, 1899,
LEADERS CLAIM
BOND FIGHT IS TO
Continued from Eighth Page.
lack of those adornments which we. demand
In the vicinity of our homes. There Is no
reason why we should not be the leading
resort of the world. What can be done In
any other climate can be done in San Fran
clkco. li v.*- did our whole duty to our-
Belves we would be known as a health re
sort second to none. A drive through the
panhandle from Van Ness avenue to the
ocean would do an Invalid as much good as
a trip to the Sandwich Islands. I cannot
see that any arguments are necessary to
convince you that It Is your duty to your
self and to your neighbor and to your pos
terity to beautify your city.
P. H. McCarthy was Introduced as a
man who irks with his hands while he
also uses his brains. H. paid:
I wish to speak about labor because bo
much has been said about labor In con
nection with this bond issue that is untrue.
We have been told that to issue bonds will
be to Invite another labor Â«'loud like that
which settled upon uÂ« during and after the
Midwinter Fair. All organized labor In
this city favors the extension of the park
system, and the labor element of this city
has done more to promote progress than all
the present opponents of progress could do
If they lived another fifty years. It is a
surprise' to me that any newspaper should
come out and dictate to labor what It
should do. Surely one evening newspaper
and the big corporation that owns It cannot
dictate to us, and 1 expect to find out next
Wednesday thai they have again been
taught the lesson they hate to learnâ that
they do not own this city and her people.
Mayor Phelan was forced to wait a few
minutes until the applause subsided.
"EaKics do not catch tiles "he said, "and
I do not wet why we should bother with
the opposition. But they have said that
we are afflicted with municipal insanity.
Well, those dear, unprogresslve people of
another day see no Joy in life, tuke no
pleasure in their city and do not want
any one else to enjoy it. They have no
ambition and have no idea of the respon
sibility of governing a great city. They
found no parks and beauty here in '49 and
they want none now. They came here in
tending to tind gold and then to fly away
on the golden wings of fortune. We are
of another generation. We have a great
and growing city. Our interests are here
and we expect to live here and to finally
repose among our beautiful hills, and
leave to our children a place better than
we found it. We are young and now is
thÂ»- time to extend and to build well for
the future. Now Is the opportunity offered
to us to do something that will have a
permanent value. Now we have â  grand
park bounded by the sea, but with no be
ginning. It certainly should begin in the
heart of our city, and no sectional ques
tion can honestly be raised. We are not
so anxious to extend the area of our
parks as we are to get the very best ad
vantage out of what we have, making It
not only more beautiful, but making all
we have more vxtluable.
"We are a rich people and have no need
to be penurious. This Is. a large corpora
tion, in which you are all partners, and
as a corporate body you can nave luxuries
that you cannot have as Individuals. San
Francisco has lost many desirable resi
dents, who rind more favorable conditions
across the bay. This Is discreditable to
us and it devolves upon us to stop it. We
must move now or we shall be credited
with going backward. By bringing the
panhandle down to Market street we shall
encourage people to use the park and thus
benefit their health The greatest advan
tage of the Midwinter Fair was to get the
people out to the park and teach them
how beautiful a place It Is. and since then
it has been used more than ever. Acquire
the land and you will find that there is
enough brain in this intelligent commu
nity to prove that we can make It beau
tiful and that we are not, as our oppo
nents say, 'insane' "

cost of the alleged luxury would fall not
upon the rich, t.ut upon the p<...r and on
then alone. The) derided the claim that
the proposed Improve ment of the Â« ity
would result in makiriK plenty of work

on the contrary the Inevitable reÂ«=ult
would l** a reduction in wages of the
workinnmrn and distress throughout rhe
city, consequent upon the great influx of
labor that would follow the publication
of the success of the panhindle move

strongest arjtument against the panhan

that before spending millions in beauti

Lumber Dealers Favor Progress.
A nu-rtlnfj of the lumber dealers was
held in Sun Francisco on- December It, at
which a lar^e reprepentatlon-was present
anil discussed the question of issuing
bonds for public improvements. After
discussing the question nt length, the- fol
lowing resolutions were unanimously
adopted:
Whereas, The proposition Is now before tne
people of this city, and soon to be voted
ui>on. looking toward the extension of
Golden Sate Park from the terminus of the
present panhandle 'to Market street and
from the northerly boundary thereof to the
Presidio Reservation; 11:1.1 whereas, the pro
posed improvements would, in the opinion
of this association, greatly enhance prop
erty values In this city and stimulate In
vestments, thus placing our municipality
In the front rank among enterprising and
prosperous cities. Now, therefore, be It
Resolved, That all Interests and all sec
tions are benefited by such measures as
will add to the attractiveness of our city
and Its eligibility as a place of residence.
Resolved. That . this - association heartily
Indorses the plan for the proposed Improve
ments and commends a favorable considera

Suo L . C Kti..r)K to EmployePH.
The executive committee of the Public
Improvement Central Club has sent out
tho following letter:
Mills Building. Dec. 22. 1599.
To the Merchants and Manufacturers of
Sun Franciscor-Gentlemen: The . It leal
Code of California requires all employers to
allow their. employes two consecutive hours
In which to vote on election day. without
any loss of employment . or wages. As a
patriotic duty we would respectfully sug
gest that you allw your employes who are
; vote.rÂ» sufficient time to vote the elec
tions on Wednesday, December 27, and Fri
day. December 29.
We recommend that merchants and manu
facturers arrange beforehand to open their
places of business a little later on the
mornings of the two elections; or, If this
Is Impracticable, to permit as many of their
employes as can be spared In the morning
to vote before they go to business,' and to
l>ermlt the. others to leave for the day in
time to reach their respective voting pre
cincts and vote before the closing of the
poll*.
As the votin* at these two elections re
quires simply the stamping of a cross (X)
'â n the ballots, very little time will be lout,
and full opiiortunlty will thus be given for
all employes to vote.
Th.- polls will open Wednesday. December
27, and Friday. December 28, at a. m., and
will close at 5 d. m. Yours truly,
ROLLA V WATT, Chairman.

Flnul Appeal to Workingmen.
Two noonday meetings In the interent

ACTIVITY IN REAL ESTATE.
REAL, estate continues active, and
all brokers report a growing in
quiry for good Investment prop
erties. While large' sales have
been comparatively few during
the past week, there are a number of big
deals on the verge of being consummated,
and the ratification of agreements for the
transfer of several large pieces of prop
erty may be announced almost any day.
One thing that has had a tendency to re
tard the closing of a number of deals is
the desire of seller or purchaser not to
dally with serious business until after the
holidays. The last two or three months
have been very prosperous for real estute
men, and have more than redeemed the
lethargy of the summer and early fall.
The largest, in fact the only large trans
action* of the week are embraced in the
purchuie on behalf of the Crocket heirs
of two valuable pieces of adjoining prop
erty located near the water front. The
purchases were made in the names of
Henry T. Scott and C. E. Green, trustees,
and include the lifty-vara Meyer lot DO
the southeast corner of First and Mission,
for which J121Â»..*)(W was paid, and the ad
joining lifty-foot lot on First stre. t. ex
tending through to Fremont street, a
depth of 27C feet H. E. Bothin was the
seller of thÂ« latter piece and the price
paid was 160,000. This is the samo pn D
erty that was last week reported to have
been purchased by Irving M. Scott. The
negotiations wre conducted by Shain

approval of the contemplated Improve

I Works. J. P. Morgan introduced P. H.
McCarthy, who addressed the worklng
â rhlfe they sat or stood around eat
ing luin h.
Mr McCarthy invited objectors to givÂ»
their opinions and was asked if the pan
handle wen not an unnecessary luxury.
"No genuine improvement is a luxury
absolutely," said the speaker. "If it be
an improvement, it Is just as purely a
-ity. f>r It Is certainly part of our
duty to" improve our city. Hut this is
f v> ntinv it . it la a plain
business proposition. Every Improvement
benefits â  verybody. You cannot define ex
1 Hctly where that benefit accrues and when
it accrues, but your neighbor cannot

perity means an enlarged purchasing and

Let that l>e your watchword."

Object to the Panhandle.
The Market-street and Eureka Valley
Improvement Club "dont want a handle"
to the park. This the club has frequently
asserted at all its meetings, and at the
one held last night it simply reaffirmed it*
former position. With the bond issue for
the other public utilities it is in favor and
will vote tor and aid in securing it for the
; â¢ Exception \\a.- taken at the ac
tion of Secretary J. P. Tuohey of the
â  leration of [mprovem< ni Clubs
in notifying associated clubs to Â»Â«.- present
at the mass in.-< ting beld on Eighteenth
street <.n tiu 1 l^th Inst, This auiliuriza-
tion, they claim, was not the action of the
ttion at its last meeting.
The club will continue to urge on the
directors of the Market-street Railroad
Company the necessity of granting trans
fer.- between the Fuimore and Castro*
tine at the rr.Â».-inK of Market and
â¦ 'hurch. To the p.opie residing in Eureka,
Valley this would be considered â  gnat
benefit and one that the company should
in all justice grant.
In order that therÂ« may be no double
banking "f votes on election day in favor
of the extended panhandle the dub de
cided to appoint 125 men to watch the
polls on the <lay of election.

Upiniont* of Opponents.
The opponents of the panhandle liave
gathered the following opinions:
HORACE DAVISâ panhandle extension is
a umlcÃÃ luxury to the mass of the people.
Only those who own teams to drive will use
it. Our Darks should not all be put Into one
section of the city, but should be scattered
so that all the people will have a chance to
enjoy them.
ANDREW S. HALLIDIEâ I do not favor the
panhandle, and do not think, from an engineer
inK or esthetic Standpoint, It has anything in
Its favor. 1 doubt if JÂ«.;.. r .u.i!oo will foot the hills
JOSEPH MUTTONâ I am opposed to buying
luxuries when we require so many necessity
at- water work* and lighting plants. Why Is the
effort made to adopt in advance that fur which
the charter provides a method of procedure?
What hidden purpose Is to be subserved by this
anticipation of the charter's provisions?
i-k i; It. TAYLOR. Dean of Law College
University of California, Charter Freeholderâ
The panhandle would be no part of the nark.
We don't need It. Why resort to old statutes,
when it could be done properly under the char
ter? To "make work" on an undertaking that
is neither useful nor ornamental la economic
nonsense.
ALFRED CRIDGEâ $4,550,000 the pan
handle Is to cost Is to be paid for real estate
How many millions it will cost to make It a.
park and to compensate property damaged its.
promoters .dare not guess.
TIKEY L. FORD. Attorney General-When
the city shall have acquired such utilities as
the may desire to porsess It will be time enough
to consider the wisdom of going Into debt for
ncn-productlve luxuries.
JAMES H. HARRY, editor Starâ Victory for
the panhandle will mean delay In public own
ership, which the charter was Intended to se
cure, and delay for parks In the more densely
populated quarters of the city.
JAMES O. MAGUIRE. ex-Congressman-
I am opposed to the panhandle because It Is
a costly luxury which will not add to the
health, comfort or happiness of the people
THOMAS MAOEB. real estate-Compare
this project with the panhandle for usefulness
and ' public' benefit: Build an electric road
round the bay to the Cliff. Make one cent
fares. Cost $1,600,000. This -v.0u1.l benefit the
poor. - - - -
K. J. LE BRETON. banker-I am opposed to
the panhandle. Those who father the scheme
have failed to present any plan for solving the
difficulties. Generalities are a dangerous quan
tity when million?, are Involved. The "fancy"
pictures circulated by Mayor Phelan are a de
lusion and a snare. .
G. L. CENTER, real estateâ The voters In
the neglected south' of market and the Mission
should vote down the panhandle. The demands
for Interest and improvements will. Absorb all
available money, , making it Impossible as It
has been In the past, to light or Improve these
sections. â¢
E. P. E. TROT, insuranceâ A city that does
occasion of the Bush-street Theater fire.
The office of the -publication was wrecked,

A. S. O'Neit will erect a large machine
shop and factory on his newly acquired

Lyon & Hoag have disposed of eight

streets, Ninth and Tenth avenues, which
was recently placed on the market by
them, to R. J. Pavert. who is erecting sev
eral modern dwellings thereon.
Hugh M. Cameron. 1038 Broadway, Oak
land, reports a lively demand for houses
to rent in all harts of that city, and dur
ing the last week has closed up several
sales, including: A corner lot on San
Pablo avenue in North Oakland for $900
to John Lacoste; also a rut on West
street, near Thirty-fourth street, to Jacob
Brunner for 1800; also a lot 40x128 feet In
the Herzdg tract for Harrison A. Jones to
B. Perez tor $250; also two lots in Hay
wards for Mrs. Sarah Terry to G. Fer

which he expects to close during the com
ing week.
It is reported that a six-story hotel or
lodging house li to be erected on the site
of the Bush-street Theater, recently de
stroyed by tire.
The local savings banks, building asso
ciations and private .capitalists have

tate security in this city during the week

resenting an aggregate expenditure of

pendent Electric Light and Power Com

to mortgage Its people for $4,f.0<i.000 to add to
a Dark where there now are 3000 acres, when
all the rest of the city does not contain twelve
acres of cultivated park. â¢"
STEWART MENZIES, shlpplnis-I am op
posed to the panhandle. It will be a burden
upon . the . people and a luxury for the few.
JOHN H. MARBLE, ex-ptMidenl Typo
graphical fnlonâ Labor will not profit from
the panhandle. Sudden booms cause the un
employed to gather and compete for employ
ment. Labor in San Francisco In to be helped
by public ownership rather than by artificially
created employment.
ED ROSENBERG, president Labor Councilâ
With telephone, gas and water companies
squeezing the life blood out of our people we
can find more pressing BMdi for our city's
money than to upend It In driveways for the
rich.

WOULD NOT WED
HICKS, FOR SHE
LOVED AKERS
Sequel to an Attempt-
Ed Suicide.
LIZZIE SULLIVAN'S BLUFF
PRIZE-FIGHTER SHANNON THE
CHIEF CONSPIRATOR.
"Billy" Hicks, the story of whose nar
row escape from a mesalliance was told
exclusively In yesterday's '"oil, appears
I to have been a shining mark for the peo
ple who were planning to get possession of
Ills purse. His friends state that matri
mony is one of his fads and that when he
returned a few weeks ago from Los Ange
les, where he had been visiting bis broth
, er, he announced that he was going to
return to the southland to wed one of the
belles of the citrus belt. For some reason
the southern match was declared off, but
"Hilly" did not become dejected over the
matter. He took a philosophical view of
! the affair, and proceeded to quench the
tire of his southern love with copious
j quaffs of tenderloin cocktails.
He succeeded In drowning the old love,
t but with the passing of the tlrst a new
affection was created and 'Hicks was un
> able to iind any one upon whom to lavish
'it This proved to be the opportunity for
"Hilly" Shannon and "Hilly" Akers. ex-
lists, and the scheme to make him a
i benedict was hatched without delay.
The woman who was selected by Shan
non and AX( to play the part of bride
was Lizzie Sullivan, whose bluff at com
mitting suicide exposed the whole con
spiracy. Lizzie loved Akers and did not
take kindly to the role that had been
selected for her. Hicks' purso faded Into
insignificance in comparison with her af
fection for Alters and when she realized
i that if the job was carried out she would
i forfeit the love of the latter she made the
pretenso of taking the dose of poison.
From all accounts she played her part
Well up to the sensational climax of the
affair. Hicks was completely charmed
and would not have hesitated to take the
vows to make her his wife.
The family of the wild young man are
much exercised over his pyrotechnioal
career and will take steps to curb him and
protect what to left of his Inheritance.
The Police Department has been appealed
to to round him up. but up to a late hour
! last night he had managed to keep out
ol sight. Detective Dinan and a score of
other hawkFhaws have been detailed on
; the case and have â  lured the tenderloin
In vain to local the gay young sport. A
special watch was placed on the Shannon
& Akers place, where It is believed Hicks
1? being secreted.
It is stated that' Hicks has dropped a
fortune in the saloon, and that
the proprietors have tried all kinds of
Fohcmcs to separate htm from his money.
l'nke prizefights were one of the pet plans
of the conspirators to get possession of
H-i-k--' wr.ilth. They wore arranged In
the saloon whenever Hicks was in the
humor to hot upon such affair*. . He was
generally given straight tips On the .win
ner and coaxed into betting heavily.
, There is no rWord that be ever won a
j cent on tho cam*.
Beautiful Christmas Presents.
The beauttftil line of medallions, water
colors In gold frames, pastels, colored

Died of Neglect.
Nora Agnes Daly, aged one and a half
months, died yesterday morning at the
i residence of her parents of neglect. The
'â  child had been sick for some time and an
abscess formed on Its head.' The father
Is laid up with rheumatism, and i.Â«< un
able to work at his trade of hod carrying
and the mother Is helpless and poverty
stricken. The child's condition grew
; worse yesterday morning, and a neighbor
I living upstairs sent for Dr. Rosenthal,
but It was too late to save the life of the
baby.

HAN FRANCISCOS. Dec 21. 1&99. .
Hon. James I). I'helan, Mayor of San Fran

provides for strict party presentation on th*
various boards and commissions which are by
the Mayor to be appointed under its provisions.
It ha3.been openly Hated to the governing '

Of course, we cannot knowâ that ! you have In
serious consideration the appointment to these
boards and commissions of certain gentlemen,
as Republicans, \*.o. In our Judgment, are not
really such.
As the charter relates exclusively to munici
pal affairs, the elector* contemplated by It to
represent the Republican party in these ap
pointments must certainly and unquestionably
be. those who have been and are Republicans In
mutters of municipal as well us of National
politics.
We therefore submit td you the eminent pro
priety, an Â«c 11 as the absolute legal necessity,
of the appointment by you as- Republican mem
ber* of said van. II lÂ«.;ir.i!Â» and commission* of
only such Republicans us supported the Repub
lican municipal ticket at the. last election.
We re-jut-st you not to appoint as representa
tive of the Republican party any citizen who.
voting at the last election, did not vote for
Horace Davis, candidate of the Republican
party Or the office of Mayor, so' that 11. â¢ Re
publican party may in fact as well as merely
In jiame be represented on these boards and
commi.sf.iona by Republicans, recognized as
mi. li by thÂ» regular organization of the Repub
lican party of this city and county, to the end
that such appointees shall not only be qualified,
I. lit iiKu willing and In a position, to represent
adequately ami fairly on said boards and com
tntHi'lons the Republican party.
Wo consider, this our duty under the law and
In discharge of the trust which has been by the
Republican party or San Francisco committed
to us. â â¢ â¢

mentfl have offered their resignations be
cause of It. A numbf-r of others, who
have been with the company for from five
to twenty years, have been discharged
without one day's warning. A quarter's
dividends baa been the result, but now
another payment la due and the company
is scheming to provide it and at the same
time bolster up its stock by making an
other general dismissal. The electric light
department Is to be utterly cleaned out.
The employes now connected with it are
to he let loose, from the chief engineer
to the most modest coal-heaver. J. a.
Davis, the assistant manager of that end
of the business, will offer .his resignation
on the Ist of th.- month, and Luke <;.
Battles, the adjuster, will follow suit. In
the loss of both men the company will
suffer. Both Battles and Davis have done
more to square the company's shortcom

other employes. Battles, in fact, was em
ployed for that purpose and has succeed

not because their salaries have been cut.
They will not stand for the :>i-Â«<nt poilcy
the company has adopted, and they have
said so. As a result they will quit their i
present employment on the Ist of the |
