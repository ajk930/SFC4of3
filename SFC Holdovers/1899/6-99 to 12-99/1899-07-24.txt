TON, July 23.â N0 ehanse in the
plans which President McKinley
himself, as commander in chief
of the army, has outlined for the cm
duct of the war ir. the Philippines is
likely to result from Mr. Root's ap
pointment as Secretary of War. The
President naturally considers that he
ha^ a better knowledge of the men to
whom he has intrusted this important
work and the details of plans outlined
for the cominsr campaign than the new
Secretary, whose work in the past has
been entirely of a legal character.
Influenced by the very optimistic dis- i
patches which he has received from
General Otis and members of the Phil
ippine Commission, the President is
h epeful, if he is not sanguine, that the
proposed operations in the autumn may
not be necessary. Yet there have been
r.o interruptions in the programme out
lined for reinforcing General Otis, and
the President has directed all prepa
rations for the coming campaign just
as if he were certain that it will be nec
essary. The new army is being organ
ized, supplies, guns and ammunition
have been ordered and the President
has engaged to provide for an army of
45,(M)f) men for the Philippine campaign.
Of course the plan of operation has not
been mapped out. That will be left to
General Otis and other military con-.
manners and will depend, of course,
upon the situation that will exist when
the rainy season is over.
Just at prese.it the question of organ
izing a squadron of cavalry is in con
templation. As stated several days ago.
eight troops of the Third Cavalry now
In th*s country are to be. sent Â»*Â» ths f
â Philippines, and O-neral Otis has in \
contemplation the mounting of one of
the three reciments which he was
authorized to enlist as a cavalry reg
iment. The Quartermaster's Depart
ment has been called upon for an
ample supply of hor-=?s and mules so
that additional regiments or mTe, if
necessary, can be mounted. A new bat
tery equippe<i with dynamite field
pieces is contemplated as one of the
new features of the coming campaign.
These are a few of the important ad
juncts of the regular line of operation
which th* administration has planned
for dealing a quick and decisive blow
to the rebels when the campaign be- <
gins at the end of the rainy season.

the new head of the War Department.
It is not improbable that the near fu
ture will see Mr. Root in the position of
Colonial Secretary and a new man at
the head of the War Department. The
entire colonial policy will doubtless be
gone over at this conference, but Cuba.
â¢ â¢ontrary to expectations, will probably
receive more attention than the war in
the Philippines. Of course. Mr. Root
will have a voice in all matters relating
to the c.'.cr.duct of the war, but the
President sires him to give particu
lar attention to the many c-ampHcated
legal questions involved in the change
from military to civil control of the
dependencies. The President will con
tinue to give close personal attenti'-n.
with the assistance of Adjutant Gener
al Corbin. to the purely military work
connected with the campaign in the
Philippines.
The question of the future of Cuba
will receive the immediate attention of
Mr. Root. The President considers
that the time has come for doing some
thing in the direction of establishing a
civil and independent government in
<"Ã¼ba. He wants to have a policy well
defined, so that he will be able to tell
Congress in his forthcoming annual re
port what the future attitude of this
country toward Cuba should be. He
had an interview yesterday with Gen
eral Charles Garcia, son of the old gen
eral, in regard to the question of hold
ing a ce:>nvention for elections in Cuba
preliminary to the establishment of an
independent form of government. Gen
eral Garcia came here to secure au
thority from the President for taking
proper steps through the medium of
suffrage for the establishment of an in
dependent form of government, and
thus prepare the way for complete po
litical control of the island.
The President believes the time has
come to give the Cubans a trial at self
government, and he wants Mr. Root to
take held oi this matter and formulate
plans whereby thr* Cubans will hai'e an
opportunity to establish some kind of
government which this country can
recognize. It is this class of work, In
volving a knowledge of constitutional
and international laws, which influ
enced the President in his determina
tion to have a lawyer, stead of a sol
dier, at the hea-i of th.? department.
Eventually it is the President's x
pectation that this will be a new de
partment of --- Government, to have
direct control of all affairs pertaining
to the colonies. Mr. Root will be ex
pected to do the work of a Colonial
Secretary rather than War Secretary,
pending the establishment by Con
gress of proposed new department.
Probably in the future he may b~
transferred to the control of the new
department, if it is authorized.
Mr Root, of course, will have much
to do with the Philippine war, but
the President will naturally depend
more upon his advice for substituting
a civil for military government in ih--
Philippines. when the time comes Â£or
such action, than he will upon his
assistance in connection with the mili
tary campaign.

July 23.â There will be neither war nor

This was the view expressed this
afternoon by an official having much to
do with the pending negotiations Re
ferring to Sir Wilfred Laurier's speech
in the Canadian House of Commons
yesterday, In which the Canadian Pre
mier declared there were only two ways
by which the difficulty could be set

said significantly: "Sir Wilfred Lau
rier is merely stating to the Canadian
Parliament the recognized methods by
which civilized nations settle contro

first, by mutual agreement: second, by
a resort tb arbitration, and third, by

outside of American control on the tsl
ard of Luzon, and is inciting the priests
to disobey the regulations of the
church and brotherhoods. The Arch
bishop of the district has issued a bull j
excommunicating Agripay. and this
action has increased the feeling be- I
tween the Filipinos md the church.
The Archbishop threatened to ex- |

It is recognized by the administration
that the boundary question is a difficult
one, as are other questions pending be

but it is not regarded as impossible of
adjustment in some way satisfactory
to American miners and the Canadian
Government as well as the United

NEW YORK. July 23.â Hundreds
of delegates representing th
trades' unions in the Greater
New York were present to-day
at the regular meeting -of the
Central Federated Union, at which the
organization of the new labor parti
came up for discussion.
Th- project was enthusiastically in

speeches being made in its advocacy.
A convention was formally called for
August 7. The place of meeting to be

will be asked to send delegates and an
organization will be effected.
At the meeting to-day Samuel Prince,
president of the Central Federated
Union, presided.
Master Workman John M. Parsons
and District Master Workman Pines
were among the speakers, and the for
mer spoke strongly in favor of the new
political movement. He said the time
for action had arrived, and that the
unions of this city must either show
their power as American people, or go
down to destruction. He asked that a
treasurer be appointed to act as cus
todian of the fund to be raised to aid
the strikers. This was done and dele
gates of various unions then pledged

officials of the administration gener
ally that, while it may take time and
the exercise of considerable patience to
work out a final solution of all pending

Newport Society Leaders Empty Their

NEWPORT. July aâ The horse has be
gun to disappear from Newport before the
rush of the automobile Into popularity.
Mr. and Mrs. John R. Drexel, who had
as fine a string of horses as were ever
brought to Newport, have disposed of
some of their line stock to make room
in their stable at Ochre Point for elec
tric carriages.
The change is admitted to be a radical
one and is the prominent topic of conver
sation at clubs and dinner parties.
The Drexels are counted as among the
i leaders at Newport^ so he fashion they
; have set in displacing their horses by au
! tomobiles is likely to be foiiowed by many
j others, and it would not be surprising if
| horses were deported in large numbers
! before the season is at an end.
The Drexel stable is being changed
; about considerably to suit the idea of its
owner as to the proper means of loco
motion about town, while the few fillies
| that remain are having a doleful i m - of

STREETCAR
WRECKED BY
EXPLOSION
Serious Encounters Be
tween Mobs and Police
at Cleveland.
CLEVELAND, July 23.â A Euclid-avenue car loaded with passengers
was wrecked by an explosion of nitro-glycerine or guncotton shortly
before 11 o'clock to-night. Th.- injured:
MRS. K. C. MARTIN. 79 Alanson street; compound fracture of the
skull, right arm broken and internal injuries -which may prove fatal.
E. C. MARTIN, right arm badly cut and bruised about legs and body.
MRS. CATHERINE HARRIS. L's Cornwall street, suffering from
I
F. A. SMITH. 69 Vienna street, injured about legs and body.
ALBERT E. FASSETT, 1- Wallace place, legs injureri.
DORA SCHESSLER. 11 Allandale street, bruised about the body.
Last night it was learned that Mrs. Martin, on - of the injured, would
probably die. She suffered a compound fracture of the skull, had one
arm broken ami was otherwise injured. 'She was with her husband,
who was also badly hurt.
The explosion tore out the front end of the car, smashed all the
windows and destroyed the brake. After considerable difficulty the car
was stopped and a call for ambulances was sent out. The motorman,
William Draggers. who came from Cincinnati, was dazed by the shock,
but Conductor Frank Schroeder of St. Louis escaped injury.
The force of the explosion was so greal that it shook all the houses
in the neighborhood and was heard for a distance of two or three miles.
There is no clew to the identity of the person who placed the explosive
on the track. Pers-^ns living in the neighborhood say they saw a man
in a buggy stop at the corner of Kensington street, where the explosion
occurred, and get out by the railroad track. He remained there a
short time and then drove rapidly away.
Within a few minutes after the explosion a crowd of a thousand
people assembled and the injured, who were suffering from shock, were
cared for until the ambulances arrived. None of them were danger
ously injured, their hurts being confined to bruises about the feet and
legs." Mrs. Martin fainted before she was taken from the car. All '-re
taken to their homes in ambulances. The motorman on the car man
aged to get out of the vestibule of the car and then fell to the street, but
he quickly recovered and helped to extricate the pasengers from the
wreck. Passengers who were on the car say the explosion seemed to lift
the whole front end of the car. and it ripped up the floor for more than
half the distance from the front end. The car was. in fact, a com
plete wreck, but strange to say it did not leave the rails and was taken
to the barn's by the next outward-bound motor.
Th- police were quickly summoned to the scene of the explosion and
a force of men was detailed to investigate with a view of running down
the person who '-â d the explosive on the track. A boy living near
th- corner saw a mysterious man in the buggy. He said he noticed the
buggy drive up there 'and stop and saw the man get out. He fumbled
about the rails for a minute or two and then jumped into the buggy
and drove away at a gallop.
There seems to be no doubt now that Mayor Farley will call out
three or four militia companies in this city available in addition to those
already under arms. The call will include the battery of artillery and
the Governor may be requested to send other troops to the city.
CLEVELAND. July 23.â The riot
ing, which continued throughout J
last night, was renewed to-day,
and there were several serious
outbreaks of violence, but no
clashes between the mobs and the
troops. Cars were started running as
usual this morning on all but one or
two lines. The mobs were astir early.
Soon after 10 o'clock a thousand or
more persons gathered on Burton
street on the South "ide and proceeded
to obstruct the track. When a car
came along with two policemen on
board, it was attacked with a shower
of stones. In spite of the policemen the
non-union motorman and conductor
were roughly handled. One of them
named McDermott, had two ribs brok- j
en and the other was badly bruised. j
One of the policemen fired at the mob.
the bullet striking a man named -Vein- |
nick. The mob assaulted the officers, j
both of whom were struck repeatedly
with stones, and but for the interven
tion of a priest of the Catholic church,
the officers mieht have been lynched.
By this time the cars had been mixed
up in the melee and a patrol wagon of
police arrived, the rioters dispersed
and the cars were taken back to the
barns.
There was a serious disturbance on |
the Broadway line at the corner of j
trie street, where a mob of 3000 as- j
sembled in the forenoon and obstructed
the track. Finally a car came along
from the Wilson avenue barns having
on board Sergeant Burrows and a pri- j
vate of militia and Detective Kelsoe.
The officer ordered the mob to disperse j
when the motorman attempted to re- j
move the obstruct: from the track.
but the rioters showed fight. Then
Sergeant Burrows and the one soldier |
with bayonets, faced the mob and at- i
tempted to clear the way. There was
a sharp fight for a few minutes luring
which i perfect shower of stones fell
about the soldier and the detective
and the car windows. No
one was seriously hurt and after ar
resting two of 'he rioters and placing
them on the car. it was returned to the
barn. The police afterward charged
the mob. making several arrests. The
military on guard at the Holmendale
avenue, barns on the South Side were
annoyed during the greater part of the \
day by a jeering mob and fifteen ar- j
rests were mad- there with the assist
arice of the police.
In the afternoon a mob of 1000 con- j
ceived the idea of blocking the track
on Orange street by placing a big j
boulder in the middle of the street and j
building a fire around it. The plan
worked successfully and cars were de- j
layed for nearly an hour, when th po
lice drove the mob away and put out j
the fire. Three men were sent to the |
hospital with wounds made by police
men's clubs at the end of this riot.
As a result of the shooting of the j
driver of a grocery wagon in South
Brooklyn yesterday afternoon by a j
non-union conductor, the Mayor of that |
villas- to-day issued an order to the
Marshal to arrest all non-union con- j
ductors who carried concealed weapons.
Every car was stopped and each con
duct ' found with a revolver was ar
rested. All were subsequently bailed
out by the company.
A small riot was started at the corner
of Pear! street and Franklin avenue j
when a young woman struck a man who
asked her not to board a non-union car.
A crowd of union sympathizers stoned {
the car and a squad of police finally j
cleared th- street.
The company to-day sent a note to
the State Board of Arbitration declining
to arbitrate the differences, in which it
says:
"This company, fully appreciating the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
sincerity of your desire to bring about
a readjustment with its former em
ployes begs to say that the men who
went out on Monday last are not in
the employ of the company and there
Is nothing to negotiate about or arbi
trate."
In the vicinity of the Holmden-ave
nue barns to-night there was continu
ous rioting for three or . four hours.
Every car that passed was attacked
with stones and several pistol shots
were fired at them. There was a lively
fusillade at one time, the non-union
crews returning the fire. The only
person hurt was a woman, who was
shot In the finger as she stood in her
doorway. The police made twenty-five
arrests in that neighborhood.
Rioting continued all along Broadway
to-night. and it took three squads of
police as many hours to escort three
cars a distance of four miles to the
barns. Fifteen or twenty of the rioters
were taken into custody.
TROLLEY CARS ARE
RUNNING IN BROOKLYN
NEW YORK. July 23.â The fact that
cars were run on all Brooklyn lines
under headway to-day shows that th
strike is practically lead. To the sea
side resorts traffic was more general
than it was last Sunday, but the public
did not take advantage of the Im
proving service, probably owing to the
fear of possible disturbances, which
have so far marked the aftermath of
- ike.
Strike leaders admit that the Brook
lyn Lapid Transit Company ran more
cars to the seaside resorts to-day than
on any day since the strike was de
clared. President Rossiter was jubilant
on Saturday before leaving for Cold
Springs, and reiterated the statement
that the strike practically was over.
He said:
"The strikers have prided themselves
on the fact hat they had been able
to tie up traffic to Coney Island, but
they cannot boast of that now. for to
morrow we will be able to carry all the
passengers who want to go to the isl
and or other resorts near the sea. I
am sorry for " men who were led
astr; >v professional agitators. I am
still willini to take back the men who
left their positions on the Brooklyn
Heights lines, but I am determined that
none Of the Nassau line men will be
reinstated as motormen or conductors."
In strike headquarters the men of
the Nassau line assembled to-day.
Master Workman Parsons did not ap
pear. District Master Workman Pines
was busy trying to encourage the strik
ers. He told them that even if th
strike should be unsuccessful they
would still have the satisfaction of
knowing that they had rebelled against
the evil system of hours and wages
introduced and maintained by Rossiter.
Mr. Pines added that if a certain sec
tion of th- press and corporations
fancied that the strike would be over
In a 'lay of two they would soon dis
cover that they were badly mistaken.
He also said that by Tuesday or
Wednesday all of the lines of the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company
would be tied up as tight as a drum.
GARMENT WORKERS

NEW YORK, July 23.â About 2500
clothing workers in three branches of
that industry struck to-day, and a

coats per day.
Eight hundred basters hold a meeting
to-day and about 300 men went out on
strike. They want shorter hours.
Twelve thousand men connected with
the United Brotherhood of Cloak
makers will hold 500 shop meetings
within the next two weeks for the pur
pose of formulating new wage lists. It
is believed that it will be necessary to
order strikes to enforce the new sched
ule.

California by a route that will not bring j
i him through Colorado. Should he come |
through this State lie will be arrested for
violation of the game law in having killed
a four-pronged buck deer out of season.
In the excitement of the chase the Illi

added the hide and head of a fine buck
to his trophies. The law is very severe
; on this infraction and the people of Colo- |
rado have spent thousands of dollars in
trying to enforce it, going so far as to
arrest army officers from Fort Duchesne
for having "killed game while rounding up.
Ctes and sending them back to their res
ervation.
The news of Governor Tanner's action
j reached Denver to-day and the game
I warden hastened to the scene to procure
j evidence to convict the entire party,
I includes several ladies. An attempt to kill
| game out of season counts the same as
iif the hunters were successful. The pen- j

Result of the Inquiry Into the Kill
ing of the Humboldt
Rancher.
DARBYVILLE, July 23â The investiga

Sheriff Brown into the death of C. H.

forms part of the fence around his house
and is about eighty feet from the porch.

hand and entered the lower part of his

on the left sub. The second bullet passed
about two inches over his head. The two
shots were heard by some of the neigh
bors, who say they were fired about 5
o'clock Friday evening.

Stegemeyer had been shot his assailants
carried him from the porch into ins own
bedroom and laid him upon -, ie floor there.

with his head resting upon a pillow. The
doors had been left unsecured, and some
hogs had gotten into the house. They had
eaten off a portion of the. dead man's nose
and one of Ids ears.

great many wine knew but little of him.

prayers over h.m were read by Samuel
Da hie, a merchant of this place.
The Inquest will be opened to-morrow
morning at 8 o'clock. So far no one has
been arrested, but the officers arc work
ing on a clew that may lead to the appre
hension of two lads who were known to be
on very unfriendly terms with the mur

PECK A STRANGER
TO TAMMANY MEN
Mystery of the Muekross
Estate Sale.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July Tammany men
have not yet recovered from the surprise
they experienced over the announcement
yesterday that A. M. Peck of Cohoes, ...
V., had bought the Muckross estate, on
which is situated the Lakes of Killarney.
None of the Tammany men who spent
Sunday in this city seemed to know Jr.
Peck, and they could not tell if he was
acting on behalf of the Tammany syndi
cate recently formed to buy the Lakes of
Killarney.
James J. Coogan. president of the bor
ough of Manhattan and one of the Tam
many men Interested in the project, was
able to throw no light on the mystery. He
said: *
"When Mr. Purke Roche first came to
see me in regard to the purchase of the
property he said that the attractiveness
of the lakes and their beautiful and
picturesque scenery was the principal
source of revenue to that portion of Ire
land, of which he was a representative in
the House of Parliament, ami that, if a
private individual should be the pur
chaser, tourists would I"- denied access to
this romantic spot, and consequently
moneys now distributed there by visitors
would be cut. off and his' constituents
would be placed in dire distress.
"Upon his statement of these facts a
meeting was held at my residence on
Fifth avenue, at which were present so.no
of the most representative citizens of New
York, who signified their willingness to
contribute sufficiently toward the pur
chase of the lakes. Thus their source of
revenue would be maintained. Two sub
sequent meetings were held, and at the
last one it was determined that this pur
chase should be made by general sub
scription, and a delegation was appointed
to call upon John F. Carroll for the pur
pose of submitting this project to him.
"As the matter was left entirely in his
hands he sent a representative of Tarn
manv Hall abroad to negotiate for the
purchase of the Lakes of Killarney. it is
possible that A. ("J. Peck may have been
the man selected, but if Mr. Carroll is
seen he can answer this question for him-
if."

taken to Saffold, where he was identified
by Mr. and Mrs. Ogletree as one of their
assailants. He said there were eight ne
groes in his gang, and that they came
from Augusta. He said two of tiw gang
were not far away.
One portion of the mob went in pursuit
of these two while the other hanged Sam
min and riddled his body wit. bullets.
The other two were overtaken, shot and
scalped, a party bringing their scalps to
Saffold this evening.
One hundred men with poinds are
after the remaining rive members of the
gang, and if caught they will be lynched.
HUNDREDS VIEW THE
BODY OF INGERSOLL
No Arrangements Have Yet Been
Made for the Disposition of
the Remains.
NEW YORK, July 23â The body of Rob
ert G. Ingersoll lay on an improvised bier
to-day in the bedroom in which he died,
at the home of Walston H. Brown, his
son-in-law, in Dobbs Ferry. Many men of
all sorts and conditions, but mostly hum
ble toilers, made the pilgrimage to Dobbs
Ferry in the hope that they might be per
mitted to gaze once more on the noted
agnostic. In no instance- was the request
refused. No arrangements whatever have
yet been made concerning the funeral.
Mrs. Ingersoll and ncr daughters, Mrs.
Brown and Miss Maude Ingersoll, are still
too much overcome with sorrow to con
sider the matter.
"They cannot tear themselves from the
beloved dead." said Mr. Farrell to-night.
"They have not left the chamber since
he passed away, except to go into an ad
joining room when visitors who wished to
'see nim called. They cannot reconcile
themselves *> the Idea that they must part
with him, and all allusions to the removal
of the body only cause a distressing out
burst of grief. It may be a few days be
fore they are calm enough to discuss the
steps that necessarily soon must be taken
for the removal of the body."
Mr. Farrell expressed the conviction
that the body will be cremated. If it is
not. it will ice buried in Sleepy Hollow
Cemetery at Tarry town, where Washing
ton Irving rests. If any funeral exercises
are held it is expected that John Clark
Ridpath will deliver the eulogy. At the
request of the family George Grey Bar
nard, the sculptor, who was a warm per
sonal friend of the colonel, will visit the
house to-morrow and make a death
mask.

Strict Regulations.
TACOMA, July 23.â As a means of stop-*
ping the smuggling of Chinese coolies
across the border from British Columbia,
Collector Huestls has been directed by the
Treasury Department to rigidly enforce
certain Chinese regulations which nave
been on the statute books for over ten
years, but never enforced. The regula
tions provide that Chinese laborers must
make their applications for certificates at
least cne month prior to their departure.
The Collector shall take a detailed de
scription of the laborer, marking it with
a number, and the certificate given the
laborer shall contain only the number and
not the description. A laborer seeking a
certificate on the ground that he has a
wife here must prove that his marriage
occurred at least one year prior, to his
application. If the certificate be claimed

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
The undersigned, a resident of the city of
Dea Moines for the past thirty-seven years, de-
sires to bear testimony to the skill of Dr.
Aborn in the treatment of pulmonary and kin-
dred complaints. About the year 1876 I was
very seriously afflicted with ' bronchial and
lunjt troubles; in fact, bad two or three cuke
severe hemorrhages, and my left lung was prac-
tically useless. Dr. Aborn treated me consti-
tutionally and by local inhalation applications,
and within two months' time I was practically
cured. I continued the treatment for some timÂ»
longer and have never suffered 1 day since from
any trouble of the kind. And my lungs and
bronchial tubes have been sound. I believe, as
any one's could be, and are at the present
time, after a lapse of twenty-three years. I
have known the doctor and of his successful
practice for the past thirty years.
During the'doctor's practice at that time I
personally know of a number of people whom
he treated with pronounced success. From my
own personal experience and observation of hi*
treatment of others, I believe the doctor to be
capable of doing a great good to persons af-
flicted with -such troubles. V*
DR. ABORN'S TREATMENT
Gives instantaneous relief, builds up

SCHEME ADOPTED
AS A WHOLE
Text of the General Agreement
as It Will Be Presented
in a Few Days*
Special Cable to The Call and tho New York
Herald Cc?pyrishted. ISS9, by James Gor
don Bennett.
THE HAGUE, July 23.â The arbitra
tion committee of the International
Peace Conference Saturday adopted the
arbitration scheme as a whole, and I
am in a position to veal the exact
terms of the project for mediation and
A- arbitration as they now stand and as
they will most certainly be finally
-greed to in the course of next week.
Article Iâ ln view of averting as much
as possible a resort to arms, the signatory
X powers agree to use all their International
cure a peaceful solution in international
differences.
.
Article 2â The signatory powers decide
that In case of grave disagreement or con
flict they will, as far as circumstances
permit before takinir arms, apply to the
good offices or mediation of one or Beverai
friendly powers.
Article 3â lndependently of this, the
powers deem it useful that one or several
disinterested powers shall, as far as cir
cumstances permit, spontaneously offer
their good offices or mediation either be
fore or during hostilities, and that such
interference shall not be considered un
friendly by the quarreling parties.
Articles ' 4 and 5 are mere developments
of preceding ones.
Articles G and " provide that the good
offices or mediation of a third power shall
cxclusi.ely have bearing on good counsel,
with- compulsory force: and unless
agreed upon specially shall not cause sus
pension of war preparations or terrup-
Article Sâ Signatory powers agree to rec
ommend the following special form of me
diation: That the quarreling States should
respectively choose two mediating pow
ers, in view of preventing a rupture of
friendiv relations during the term of me
diation, which is not t<> exceed thirty days.
Quarreling powers shall have no direct
intercourse between themselves on the
â¢subject of the quarrel, which will be left
entirely to the consideration of the mcdi
' * Articles 0. 10. I. 12 and IS provide that in
International differences caused by differ
ence of views as to facts which may be
made an object of local inquiry and do
not involve the honor or vital interests of
the powers concerned, the latter Should
have recourse to the institution of inter
national committees of inqury to impar
tially decide on the matter of fact. Pow
ers Concerned will afford such committees
all necessary facilities for their enlight
enment. Committees reports will not have
the character of arbitration award, but
will leave the powers concerned at liberty
to act as they feel best.
Article 14 is about the principle of in
ternational arbitration.
Article 15 â In ail questions of judicial
bearing, and especially as regards mean
ing or anplication of international treat
|Â»s; arbitration is acknowledged to be the
-sost efficient and most equitable mode of
ettling differences.
Articles 16 and 17â The arbitration con
ention implies an agreement to submit in
loodI ood faith to the arbitration award.
Article IS â Independently of general or
lecial arbitration treaties, signatory pow
rs reserve for themselves the right to
onclude either before or after the rati
cation of the peace conference acts new
nd general or special agreements in view
r" extending compulsory arbitration to all
ises they may deem fit.
Articles 19 and _!>â The powers agree to

y 1 Dear Mrs. Pinkham â I have many,
many thanks to give you for what your
Vegetable Compound has done for me.
After first confinement I was sick for
nine years with prolapsus of the womb,
had pain in left side, in small of back,
a great deal of headache, palpitation
of heart and lencorrhoea. I felt so
weak and tired that I could not do my
work. I became pregnant again and
took your Compound all through, and
now have a sweet baby girl. I never
before had such an easy time during
labor, and I feel it was due to Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. I
am now able to do my work and feel
better than I have for years. I cannot
thank you enough." â Mrs. Ed. Eh-
u_v6_r, Device, Tex.
Wonderfully Strengthened.
" I have been taking Lydla E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound. Blood
Purifier and Liver Pills and feel won-
derfully strengthened. Before using
your remedies I was in a terrible state;
felt like fainting every little while. I
thought I must surely die. But now,
thanks to your remedies, those feel-
ings are all gone." â Mrs. Emii.de

NEZ PERCE
INDIANS IN
UGLY MOOD
Threaten to Murder Graders
on the Northern Pacific
Railroad.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOISE, Idaho, July 23.â Word from
Lewiston over the long-distance
telephone is to the effect that,
while the Indians on the Nez
Perce reservation have out
wardly submitted to the agreement of
their chiefs to permit work on the
Northern Pacific grade through the
reservation to proceed, still the young
bucks continue to manifest an ugly
spirit, which is brutalized by liquor
furnished by white men. The bucks
will not be satisfied, It seems, until they
kill some one. They threaten to swoop
down on the graders again as they did
a few days ago, this time not to scare
them off. but to murder.
There are no soldiers there and the
United States Marshal has made no
effort to give the workingmen adequate
protection. Deputy marshals at the
scene report that trouble of a serious
nature seems unavoidable unless liquor
can be kept away from the young
bucks or a military force Is stationed
to protect the graders. Large quanti
ties of liquor has been confiscated, but
there seems to be no end to the re
sourcefulness of the thirsty savages.
The unflinching nerve of Agent Stran
ahan, who went alone among the ex
cited Indians a few days ago, alone
saved his life. In order to prevent un
necessary excitement Stranahan did not
reveal the true temper of the Indians,
but he now admits the situation at
that time was very much more strained
than he cared to disclose then. During
the excited interview with the Indian
chiefs and others a burly chief stepped
up to him, and, drawing a knife, an
nounced it to be his purpose to kill
Stranahan for his insolence. An older
chief attempted to interfere, but was
floored. A scene of indescribable con
fusion ensued, the Indians becoming
more frenzied each moment. Strana
han expected to be killed. He boldly
defied the Indians, however, telling
them the Great Father's soldiers would
avenge his death by killing every In
dian implicated. His nerve and his ut
terances absolutely cowed the Indians.
After some further parleying Strana
han withdrew. Later some of the In
dians, wild under the influence of li
quor, and still chafing under the agent's
words, started to hunt for the agent, but
he had lost no time in placing a safe
distance between himself and the reds.
The chiefs have agreed to allow the
railroad to proceed without further
molestation, but they say they cannot
control the young bucks, especially
when they have access to liquor.
Railway Employes Exonerated.

MAKING CAPITAL OF
INGERSOLL'S DEATH
Spiritualist Reports ao Alleged
Conversation With the Soul
of the Agnostic.
SPRINGFIELD. Mo., July 23.â Five thousand people attended the
Zoo Park spiritualist camp meeting to-night to hear Mrs. Cora L. V.
Richmond deliver an address under alleged control of the spirit of Rob
ert G. Ingersoll.
Mrs. Richmond began to speak in the first person, addressing the
audience as Colonel Ingersoll and de; ribing the sensation experienced in
dying.
The spirit said the other life was yet a great mystery, but that no
moment of unconsciousness intervened at death. In passing out of the
body there was no pain, but a quickening sensation as though delirium
resulted. The spirit passed into a new body.
The earth form of life lay before the risen spirit and weeping friends
of the deceased could be distinctly seen and heard standing by the side
of the lifeless body, viewing the unconscious brain and pulseless heart
and yet feeling every faculty of mind alive and active.
The message spoke of the agnostic's failure to investigate evi
dences of Immortality and candidly retracted any materialistic views
that he had ever taught.
There was no flight through space In reaching the other life. ThÂ»
two worlds seemed to intermingle.
The spirit had already discovered that each soul enters into an In
heritance of his thoughts and deeds in this life immediately at death.
There was no escaping this law of compensation and retribution. What
ever is sown In this world must be reaped in the next, is the message
which Mrs. Richmond delivered from Colonel Ingersoll.
MADISON, Wis., July 23. 1n speaking of the death of Robert G.
Ingersoll to-day, Archbishop Martinelli said: "I sincerely hope he is
saved. Death must come to all of us. Probably Mr. Ingersoll is now
able to prove to his complete satisfaction whether there is a hell and
a devil."

Henry Collins, a plumber of Sausalito,
this afternoon.
Collins started for Mill Valley on horse
back this morning. When he reached Han
sen's saloon he stopped and bad several
drinks with the proprietor. While he was
in the place he became engaged in a row
with Hansen and he was thrown out of
the saloon, Hansen following to continue
the light outside. He made a rush at Col
lins, who drew his revolver and fired.
Hansen fell to the ground and Collins
made for his horse and galloped down the
road. toward Sausalito.
It was found that Hansen was shot
in the abdomen, the bullet emerging near
the spine. Dr. Mays was sent for from
Sausallto, and he declared the wound to
be fatal.
A telegram was sent to Sausalito telling
â  of the shooting and warning the authori-
I ties to be on the watch for Collins, so
I when he arrived he found Marshal John
; Harmon waiting for him. He was taken to
â¢ San Rafael, where he was locked up to
await the outcome of Hansen's wound.
Late to-night Or. Mays did not expect
Hansen to live more than a few hours.
It is believed by some that the real
j cause of the shooting was jealousy. Col
â¢ lins was married about six months ago to
a Miss "Walker in Sausallto. She knew
Hansen, and it ls believed that Collins
objected to their acquaintance and that
in this lay the cause of the first assault.
â  Collins had been raising trouble on his
way to Mill Valley. He went Into several
of the camps en route and behaved in a
rather boisterous manner, leading many
to the suspicion that he was under the
influence of liquor.
WILL PROSECUTE THE
LOUISIANA LYNCHERS
Assurance Given the Italian Govern
ment That Amends Will Be Made
for the Lives Taken.
ROME, July 23.â The Popolo Romano,
referring to the recent lynching of Ital
ians at Tallulah, La., says the United
States has given assurances that it will
prosecute rigorously all who were con
cerned in the commission of the crime.
The Tribuna declares that the lynching
was clue to the knowledge that Italian
Immigrants to the I'njted States are not
afforded proper protection and may be at
tacked with impunity and calls the atten
tion, the Italian Government to the
matter.

MILLION-DOLLAR
BLAZE IN TOLEDO
Grain Elevator Totally
Destroyed.
â â
WATCHMAN'S NARROW ESCAPE
â â¦ â
HURLED OUT OF DANGER BY AN
EXPLOSION.
â¦
Fortunately the Fire Occurred on
Sunday, Otherwise Loss of Life
Would Have Been Heavy.
Combustion the Cause.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOLEDO, July 2.l.â The Cincinnati,
Hamilton and Dayton elevator, located In
East Toledo, was totally destroyed by
fire to-night, and the loss on building and
contents will reach nearly $1,000,000. It is
not known how much insurance is on the
grain, amounting to 900.000 bushels of
wheat, but the building carries $185, in
various companies. The elevator has been
unusually busy for the past two weeks
and was working night and day to store
the 150 cars of wheat which are received
daily at the place.
The fact that this was Sunday prevent
ed the fatalities which might have fol
lowed, for the forty men employed there
had quit work early and had been out of
the place about two hours. The watch
man had once made the round of the
building, had found everything safe and
was on his way to the top on his second
trip. He was not aware there was a fire,
but observers noticed a small blaze in the
cupola.
An alarm was immediately turned in,
but before any of the tire department
could reach the place a terrific explosion
occurred, that rocked the foundations of
surrounding buildings. A mass of flame
shot up in the air hundreds of feet.
The building was almost immediately
enveloped, and within ten minutes an
other and more terrific explosion oc
curred which tore out the entire side of
the building near the river. This explo
sion hurled the watchman W. E. Welch,
out of the flames and saved his life. He
was only slightly injured, and will re
cover.
The enormous building was a mass of
ruins half an hour after tne first blaze
was noticed. The work of the Are depart
ment was futile, and most of their ener
gies were directed toward saving adjoin
ing property.
The C. H. and D. elevator was largely
owned fay Eastern capital. President
Woodford of the Cincinnati. Hamilton and
Dayton road is president of the company.
An elevator owned by this company was
burned on the same site four years ago,
and the present building was erected to
fee the most complete and st perfect in
the country. The fire department claim
spontaneous combustion caused the blaze.

BARBECUE UNDER
THE OAK TREES AT
STANFORD FARM
Several Hundred Invited Guests
Feast, Dance and Listen
to Speeches.
PALO ALTO, July 23.â The Stanford
stock farm was the scene to-day of a
bullshead barbecue given by Superintend
ent Frank W. Covey of the stock farm.
James Murray, George Woods and J. O.
Johnson to their numerous friends and to
the employes of the farm. Three hundred
brilliant cardinal invitations were sent
out. reading: "Las Robles; third annual
reunion, July 23," and everybody, It
seemed, accepted and came in his Sunday
best to enjoy the festivities.
The literary committee was composed of
Charles M. Shortridge, Bert Herrington
and James W. Rea; the committee on
good government. John D. Mackenzie;
master of ceremonies, Henry Clay Faber
of Palo Alto.
The scene of the feast was under the |
spreading live oaks of the farm, where \
seven long tables nad been set and loaded j
with tempting viands. The trees over
head were hung with flags and lanterns.
Caterer Joe Saliceti and his white-aproned,
assistants had begun the preparation of
the feast last night, and at midnight the
eight great bullsheads nad been placed
in the warm pit and were roasting. The
bakery wagon with its 100 great round i
loaves had contributed its quota, and the I
watering-cart was on hand to succor the |
thirsty. At noon the people commenced i
to comeâ they kept on comingâ some !
on foot, some on horseback, and others
in all kinds and conditions of drags,
phaetons, 'buses.
Under the "kitchen" tree the cooks were
busy with their preparations. Besides the
bulfsheads there was a sheep and other ,
meat to be roasted, and a pit had been |
dug and filled with wood. Across the top
were long iron spits, on which the meat
was impaled and sizzled over the fire.
Then there was the corn, which had been
roasted similarly to the heads in the hot
ashes; liquid refreshments to cheer; chili
con came and chow chow added zest to
the roasts. The long tables were crowd- ,
the charity of our church. Among all the
ruins of antiquity which we see- in Rome
and elsewhere we never find evidences of
hospitals or asylums for the poor amid
the costly buildings erected for the com
fort and pleasure of the rich in those
times. It has remained for Christianity
to foster the fatherhood of God by minis
tering to the needy, as this society is do
ing now; as this asylum for orphans is
doing. I take a great interest in all this
work, and 1 hope one day to have a train
ing school connected with the asylum
which will educate the boys in trades and
enable them to fight their Way through
the world. I am doing all I can to pros
per our charities in the archdiocese. 1
have told the good Christian Brothers to
give the boys here the best food and
clothing, and not to spare money in such
purchases.'' The Archbishop heartily
complimented the society upon the good
showing made by the various conferences
for the past quarter, and praised the good
management of Brother Michael, who is
in charge of the asylum. After the en
tertainment the following delegates and
Invited guests sat down to a delightful
repast, which pleasantly concluded the
day's work:
Archbishop Riordan. Rev. Fathers Lagan.
Crowley, Byrne. Phillips. Mulligan, Verwelleg
heir. Cottle: Brothers Theodoras, ErmlnoM,

Ed with diners and the waiters were kept
busy supplying them with viands.
After dinner the crowd repaired to the
dancing platform, where the light fantas
tic was tripped during the afternoon and
evening. Good cheer and good fellowship
were the order. During the % afternoon
there was some speechmaking. Senator
Charles M. Shortridge was the first speak
er to the stand. Said he:
I do not feel called upon to do mere than to
thank the kind friends who have arranged this
feast, and to acid that I am charmed to meet
these friends under the oaksâ the oaks which
I never look at without becoming poetical. It
does me good to be surrounded by the up
turned faces of friends, gathered thus for a
good time, expecting no more than the happy-
American way of enjoyment â free an* easy.
I should add. though, in all respect, that I
believe no harm can come fror-. Innocently en
joying this music and amusement. We believe
in the Father above, who looks down and
blesses us. __"
Here's to the gl.Mous republic that blesses
you and your children, whose flag has waved
over the barefooted troops of Washington on
Boston Heights and over our gallant boys in
the hot islands across the Pacific. Here's to
the republic of Washington. Blame, Garfield
and the patriot McKinleyâ the republic that be
lieves In iaw and in extending liberty to all
over whom It waves.
Glad am I that I am one of that republic,
and glad am I to be with you to-day. Then
"on with th- danceâ let Joy be unconfined.
Master of ceremonies Faber was then
called for and spoke feelingly of the oaks
which sheltered the people this glorious
California day. He paid a glowing tribute
to the women present and to womankind
in general. IB"*.-- , _ .
Frank Covey thanked the crowd for the
reception given the endeavors of his
friends and of himself. Sheriff Robert T.
Eangford also added a word concerning
the sociability of barbecues in general and
the Stanford barbecue in particular. Mr.
Torrence gave a recitation. Then the
amusements of the lay were resumed.
The barbecue was the most successful
affair of its kind given in this region for
some time, and every one Joined in praise
of the liberal souls who had given them
so much enjoyment.

Seminary in Menlo Park is being laid out

The pining will be done from the Stan
ford residence to the county road at the
expense of the university authorities and
from that point will be carried by the
seminary. The total length of the line
will be from three to four miles. It is
the intention of the university to furnish
free 50,000 gallons of water a day to the
seminary'- This is simply the carrying out
of the plans which Governor Stanford
formed during his lifetime. Nothing was
said about it in his will, but Mrs. Stan
ford was well acquainted with his inten
tions and has only been waiting for the
time when sufficient funds could be spared
for the purpose.
CHINESE EASTERN
RAILWAY MEN HERE
TWO OFFICIALS ABE AT THE
CALIFORNIA HOTEL.
The Inspector of Ageni~.es and an
Agent of the Company Pay San
Francisco an Unofficial Visit.
Alexander Verblunski, inspecting re
viser of agencies of the Seagoing Service
of the Chinese Eastern Railway Company,
and W. Isnard. an agent of the same com
pany, are registered at the California Ho
tel. They arrived by the steamship Am
erica Marti and are spending a few days
in this city on a tour of inspection, inci
dentally viewing the harbor facilities of
this port.
According to these officials, the Chinese
Eastern Railway Company's ships will
reach San Francisco in four or five years
at the latest. This company, which is a
private corporation, with official Russian
backing, connects with the Trans-Siberian
Railway, giving the latter an outlet at
Port Arthur. Port Arthur, unlike Vlad
ivostok, the terminus of the Trans-Sibe
rian road, is open all the year.
The steamship division of the Cmnese
Eastern Railroad has now ten ships on its
two lines, and in two years it will double
the number. At present these vessels ply
simply between Port Arthur and Vladivo
stok and Shanghai.
M. Verblunski was much interested in
the harbor conditions of San Francisco,
and said that without doubt his company
â would establish a line ol steamers here
in a very few years.
The Russians leave Tuesday evening for
Chicago. They will then proceed to Chi
cago and thence to St. Petersburg, via
London.
Peculiar Chinese Celebration.
Chinatown has just passed through the
throes of a unique celebration. About
a thousand years ago To C in, the son of
wealthy and philanthropic parents, died
from grieving over their death, and every
year since that unhappy event the de
scendants of the Wong family, of which
he was a member, have observed the an
niversary* with a series of festivities cov
ering a period of three days. The anniver
sary was held in the Wong Tonj-- Joss
house, and the final act of the celebration,
which was concluded last night, consisted
of destroying an image of the lamented
To Chin and a scramble among the nu
merous Wongs for fragments of the re
mains, the possession of which is sup
posed to insure good luck for the balance
of the year. Only members of the Wong
family are allowed to participate in the
festivities, and the anniversary is a great
annual event in their lives.
Bohemian Jinks.
The members of the Bohemian Club and
a few invited guests enjoyed the club's
annual jinks on Saturday night at the
organization's grove near Guerneville. The
ceremonies were reported as having been
effectively performed, especially the
scorning of Dull Care and his final dis
comfiture. Some of the members returned
last evening and immediately retired into
seclusion.

A QUEER COMMERCIAL MIDSUMMER.
THIS is probably the best midsummer season j
ever known to American trade. The failures
are the smallest and the railroad earnings the
largest, while the clearing-house exchanges are j
48.6 per cent heavier than in July, 1898, and 62
per cent heavier than in 1892, the two best previous j
years. Boston shipments of boots and shoes for the
first half of the year exceed those for the same time ,
last year by over 3,000.000 pairs. Manufacturers of
woolen goods are free buyers of wool in the East
and their agents are purchasing heavily in the West.
Hides and leather are rising slightly under a good de
mand and limited stocks. Wild speculation in tin has
lifted the price to about the highest level ever known.
The demand for iron does not abate and many works .
are still refusing orders. All fears of deficiency in
Western crops have been dispelled by receipts of
13.561.000 bushels thus far this month, against 3,773r
000 during the same time last year. The corn crop
of the country gives splendid promise, and several
Western States, especially Kansas, will probably
break all previous records this year. The aggrega
tion of the distributive trade of the country is of un
precedented volume and the demand for fall and win
ter goods is increasing with such continuity as to ex- ;
tend the most flattering hopes for the next six or
eight months. t
Such is the commercial condition of the country
to-day, when dogs run mad. when people a-e off at ,
the seaside or in the country, when the days east of the
Rockies are hot and the nights do not give relief. If
business is unprecedented under such adverse condi- 1
tions, what will it be when the midsummer season is
over and cooler weather further stimulates trade? ;
We thought last year was a record-breaker, but 1890
bids fair to beat 1898, with distance to spare. True,
there have been clouds on the horizon of late, but
they are passing. The stringency of the London
money market has thus far produced no appreciable
effect on this country: foreign complications, which
for some weeks were a menace to international trade, j
are being harmoniously adjusted; labor strikes, which 1
have been no less a menace, are being settled, and J
the scare over large combinations of industrial capi- i
tal, which started a brief panic in Wall street last
spring, have ceased to be a bugbear to the banks, for
it is found that they are governed by the same trade
laws that regulate smaller concerns and individuals.*
In brief, the commerce of the United States seems on
such firm foundations that ordinary adversities fail to
shake it.
Like the general markets, the local situation is' in
fine shape. The crops as a rule are as large as ex
pected and, with a single exception or two. are bring
ing fine prices. Fruit keeps up to the high plane of
values established at the beginning of the season,
quotations for grain allow the farmer a satisfactory
profit, the mining interests are recovering from the
bad effects of the dry winter of 1897-98, and the export
trade of the coast is still so heavy that shippers are
bothered to find vessels enough to carry away the
merchandise ordered by foreign countries. This is
a millennial condition which certainly ought not to
be grumbled at. The State shows the effects of it m
easy credits, abundance of money at declining rates
of interest, and a pronounced scarcity of labor in
almost all sections. Everybody who wants to be is
at work at something or other, and in the country the
cry is still for men to work the harvest machines. Like
ships, railroad cars are scarce, which delays shipments
of produce to the city. The merchants are so busy
that they cannot find time to complain, for which
blessed state of affairs thanks are due to the Goddess
of Prosperity. How long this commercial millennium
will continue is a conundrum; but there are no signs
at present that it will not continue indefinitely.
The Examiner pictured itself .yesterday as the boss
of the Democratic game, holding up very conspicu-
ously Phelan and Dodge as something like trump
cards. Rainey was not displayed. He is the card
evidently that is kept up the sleeve.
The international university contest in London on
Saturday was really a match of Cambridge and Ox
ford combined against Harvard alone. Yale wasn't
in it.
THE DUTY OF BUSINESS MEN.
rROM this time on until the polls close on elec
tion day, it is the duty of the business men of
San Francisco to devote no inconsiderable por
j tion of their thoughts and their energies to politics.
' Tiieir own interests require it. The welfare of the city
| demands it.
The situation is critical The officials to be elected
this fall will organize and inaugurate the municipal
government under the new charter. That government
will be largely in the way of an experiment, for in
many respects it will differ widely from that which
now exists. New and untried powers will be placed
in the hands of the officials and those of the Mayor
will be exceptionally great. Under such circum
j stances it is imperative that the making of the experi
! ment be intrusted to conservative, honest men, who.
i in addition to their honesty, have the sagacity to
! avoid blunders and the courage and firmness to resist
1 every pressure that may be put upon them to swerve
; them from the path of duty.
By what means shall the municipality be assured of
j such officials? To that question intelligence can give
i but one answer. To accomplish the election of good
' men, good men must go to work. The business inter
ests of the municipality will never be safeguarded un
, til the business men themselves stand guard.
There is no chance for an independent movement,
even if one were desirable. The government of the
! city will be intrusted either to the Democratic party
lor to the Republican party. Which shall it be? The
! business men, the property owners, the taxpayers,
i the intelligent workingmen of the community must i
\ decide. [
j Two factions contend for control of the Democratic
j party. One is led by Rainey, the other by Buckley.
! The Examiner, which but a short time ago boasted
! of having driven Rainey not only out of politics but
! out of the country as a fugitive to Canada, which has
I caricatured his features to the most brutal, the most
beastly forms its artists could depict, has now en
â¢ tered into an alliance with him and fights on his side
! for supremacy in the party. The facts are notorious I
I and are known of all men. A Democratic victory at
j the polls will entail a municipal administration either
j under the domination of' Buckley or under that of
i Rainey and the Examiner.
I Can any business man face such a menace and re
' main indifferent? Can he ignore the fact that his j
private interests as a property owner, as well as his I
I duty as a citizen, require him to give heed to the
danger and to take steps to avert it? j
The Republican party has already given abundant
evidence of serving faithfully the public interests in
this campaign. An attempt of a few bosses to gain
advantage for themselves by providing for a blanket
ticket at the primary elections was defeated by the
protests of the Republican press and of the
rank and file of the party. A new arrange
ment has been .made by which the primaries
will be conducted in a manner that is fan
to all. Vigilance, however, will be required to
prevent illegal voting. Evidence has already been
disclosed of attempts to colonize illegal voters in the
Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Assembly districts.
The forces of corruption, it will be seen, have been
baffled but not beaten. The fight must be contin
ued until the polls close.
The issue is with the business men of the city.
If they will now organize for the contest
they can assure the election of good men
to the county convention. That in turn will
bring about the nomination of a strong ticket and
a strong county committee. The result will be vic
tory at the polls and a business administration under
the new charter. The outlook is promising, provided
the taxpayers will shake off their indifference and
attend to their political duties. Corruption and dema
gogy will not triumph if honesty and intelligence
are resolute to combat them.
REGULATIONS FOR AUTOMOBILES.
AN article in The Call on the regulation of auto
mobiles, called forth by a petition from a
dairyman asking a permit to run a motor milk
: wagon through the streets, has been misunderstood
:by the petitioner. He assumes that because we ad
i vocate some regulations for automobiles we are op
. posed to their introduction for general use, and he
I writes to protest and to declare that our "position is
I untenable."
If we had ever taken any position in opposition to
the coming vehicle, it would indeed be untenable.
We have never done so. In fact The Call has been
doing more to direct public attention to the merits
of the new vehicle and to promote its use than all
other papers on the Pacific Coast combined. At this
very time The Call in conjunction with its ally, the
: New York Herald, has an automobile making its
â  way under difficulties across the Continent for the
: purpose of testing the value of the vehicle for use on
', the average American country road. That experiment
I will be of vast importance in promoting the develop-
I ment of the use of the machine, for it will not only
' advertise it. but by the completeness and the severity
i of the test will show just what alterations and im
. provements are needed to make it generally available.
Every sort of vehicle used upon the streets of cities
jis subject to regulation. There are certain rules for
! street cars, for bicycles, for wagons and for carriages,
i and some regulation must be provided for the auto
| mobile. The Call has advocated no particular rules.
> It merely directed attention to the discussion of the
' subject now going on in Eastern cities, where automo
biles have become common. So far from seeking to
prevent the use of motor carriages on the streets,
The Call would be the first to combat any attempt to
enact ordinances that would handicap them.
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.
ACCORDING to all reports,* the athletic con
. tests between British universities represented
by Cambridge and Oxford on one side and
American universities represented by Harvard and
Yale on the other, were in every respect fairly con
tested and neither side has any complaint to make of
the other. Out of the nine events the British carried
off the honors in five and have therefore the glory of
the triumph. It is, however, a defeat in which the
Americans have nothing to mourn over except that
luck was against them. One of their crack men,
Burke of Harvard, who was counted on to win the
half-mile race, broke down from sickness, so that
race, and with it the victory of the whole, went to
the English.
As a rule international sporting events lead to so
much wrangling, no little gratification will be felt on
both sides of the ocean over the genuine good will
and good fellowship that has been shown in this con
test from first to last. Our men speak in high terms
of the way in which they hive been treated, and when
a return match is held in the .United States the cham
pions from Cambridge and Oxford will be made most
cordially welcome wherever they may go.
While the closely contested matches may be taken
as a fair enough exhibition of the comparative ath
letic excellence of the members of the competing
universities, they must not be regarded as in any
THE "SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, JULY 24, 1899.
1 right sense of the term a test of the university, ath
â  letes of the two countries. Cambridge and Oxford
may be said to represent the flower of university ath
! letics in Great Britain, but Harvard and Yale hold
jno such supremacy in this country. Pennsylvania,
j Princeton, Cornell and Columbia have frequently
I beaten them in all sorts of contests and there are
J Western universities which could doubtless do equally
j well against them, if opportunity were offered.
There has been some talk of making up a team from
j ail American colleges to contest with the British in
j the next match. It is not likely, however, that any
| such thing will be done. There is a good deal of social
caste and prestige in university life, and Harvard and
Yale are not likely to invite Western colleges to help
| them out, any more than Oxford and Cambridge are
1 likely to call upon the other universities of the United
Kingdom to furnish men for their teams.
The matches in fact are not international univer
sity contests. They are largely social functions car
ried on by the men of four great and wealthy univer
sities, where there is almost as much high life as in
tellectual life, and they are likely to remain so. If a
team were drawn from all American universities to
icpresent the best of our young athletes, it is not at
all improbable the interest in the event would be less
than what it is now. Harvard and Yale are no longer
dominant among our universities, but they have far
more prestige than any other and in our international
university contests we must stand or fall with them.
THE POLITICAL STAMPEDE.
THE extraordinary collection of associated false
hoods, which the Examiner is now daily pub
lishing, is the strongest possible evidence that
the labors of The Call and its allies for the restoration
of political decency have been fruitful, and that in
the approaching municipal canvass a stampede of
honest citizens toward the Republican organization is
inevitable.
The last freak of the Examiner is to represent itself
as a bare-legged girl with a soliciting expression,
holding in Tier right hand a picture of Mayor Phelan,
and in her left a photograph of the fusion Assessor,
who capitalized an increase of valuations of corpo
rate property but forgot that a discrimination of from
fifteen to thirty per cent against ordinary citizens was
a very poor argument in favor of a fusion assessment.
In connection with its pictorial illustration of its
own degradation, the Examiner undertakes to pre
sent a stock account of what it terms its "recent suc
cesses," among which it enumerates "defeat of the
Market Street Railway franchise grab" and also "im
portant reduction in rates for gas in San Francisco.'
It then proceeds to add to these remarkable victories
"the defeat of the Geary street franchise grab and of
the double-track job for tlte Mission, accomplished
by the Mayor, with the assistance of the sturdy mi
nority of the Board of Supervisors." and crowns its
succession of important falsehoods by observing that
"on top of all this comes the very important conces
sion of 25 cents per thousand feet reduction in gas
rates, forced from the corporations."
The Call has already done full justice to the Board
of Supervisors, which assuredly deserves credit for
the manner in which it has protected the municipal
welfare against the Examiner, the Mayor and the
Assessor. But the mendacious catalogue of
the Examiner deserves at least a slight recog
nition. When the wholesale scheme of rob
bery by the Market Street Railway Company had
been defeated, through the integrity of the
Board of Supervisors, sustained by The Call and
to some extent by other local newspapers, it was
generally conceded that proper street railway facilities
should be afforded to the northeastern part of the
peninsula. Then a final effort to steal from the
municipality and to bar out possible competition was
made by the proposed new franchise on Grant ave
nue and Bush street, and this defeated project. was.
distinctly advocated by the Examiner's candidate for
re-election to the office of Mayor, whose physiognomy
fills the right hand of the maiden whom the fusion
organ has specialized as its representative. '
The reduction of the rates for gas from Si 75 to
$1 50 per thousand feet was another serious injury
inflicted upon the community through Mayor Phelan
and the Examiner. It had been proved, over and
over again, that the rate of $1 10 per thousand feet,
incorporated into the resolutions that originated in
Mayor Phelan's office and were adopted by the Board
of Supervisors, covered an ample profit upon the
actual capitalization of the gas monopoly, and even
a very ordinary exhibition of backbone would have
secured to our taxpayers a rate of $1 35- But, in the
first place, the Mayor's resolutions were not worth
the paper upon which they were written, and in the
second place, when the negotiations for settlement
transpired, the shrewd lawyers and manipulators for
the lighting corporations handled him with an case
that must have been surprising to themselves.
Here are two facts alone, with which the people of
San Francisco are familiar, that demonstrate the
absurd recklessness of the Examiner. The practical
advance toward the overthrow of political bosses and
of corporate dominancy, of which so many proofs
have been recently furnished, has been due almost
entirely to Republican integrity and has been achieved
in the face of the fusion organ and of its candidates
for Mayor and for Assessor. *
The Call repeats that in municipal politics at least,
this is a Republican year, and that now as in 1896
and in 1808. Examiner leadership treads the easy road
to degradation and to failure.
The statement of the Canadian Premier that the
Alaskan boundary dispute must be settled by arbi
tration on the basis propjsed by Canada or there will
be a fight, may be taken as the most decided expres
sion of a willingness to see Canada annexed to the
United States that has yet come from an official rep
resentative of the Dominion.
There is not a great deal of probability that the
trust in spiritualism projected by Mrs. Mary Ellen
Lease will work. Mary Ellen can never be the only
ghost dancer in the business while Peffer can cry
out from behind his whiskers now and again that it
is all a mistake to number him among the dead.
The other day a member of Parliament attempted
to enter the Parliament house yard in .n automobile,
but was stopped by the police; and from the ruction
that followed it is evident the incident will be the only
one of the kind that will ever happen in British his

DEEP MINING STORIES.
AN EXPOSITION TRIUMPH.
A NEW MINERAL FOUND.
ON FILIPINO MINING.
PNEUMATIC PROSPECTING.
The California mining industry has
J scored an unexpected triumph in rela
i tion to the Paris Exposition as did the
â  viticultural industry. The California min
| ing display is to get one-fourth of the
entire -space allotted to the United
! States. This should stimulate enterpris
; ing co-operation with the California com
| mission in placing the finest and most
; effective exhibit possible under the rules
of the exposition.
The arrangements for State exhibits
were consigned to Victor C. Heikes by F.
i V. Skiff, director of the United States
I mining exhibit. Mr. Heikes, as special |
J commissioner, visited several Western j
mining States, finding nowhere organized
' preparations for representative State ex
hibits. He talked to men and organiza
i tions, explained the plans and conditions
; of the exhibit, told what was wanted and
! solicited,, with considerable success,
1 efforts to gather an exhibit in each State.
j But when he got to San Francisco two
; weeks ago he found an active and able
| commission at work with $130,000 at its
I back and that it had already made liberal
i plans for the largest mining exhibit pos-
s ible and put the matter in the hands of
Charles G. Yale, perhaps vie most com
petent man in the .Stale for the work.
ii" soon learned more about the greatness
of the industry in this State and about
its unapproached variety of mineral re
sources than he ever knew before. He
talked with Mr. Yale and heartily ap
- proved his selection as he did his pre
'â  liminary plans and ideas. He decided that
all he had to do here was to explain
the wants and conditions of the exhibit,
i give California room according to its
merits and enterprise and leave the rest
with -Mr. Yale.
The result of his study and his confer
ences with the commissioners, Secretary
Gaskill and Mr. Yale, was that he allot
ted practically one-fourth of the space
given the United States to California.
' Like every other feature of the exposi
tion the mining exhibit requires com
pression and the whole United States ex
-1 hibit will not cover much area, but then
it fares better than other countries and
California gets a quarter of its shareâ
, and that is not one-forty-flfth. The
United States display of mineral speci
mens will be in sixteen big cabinets, and
California may fill four all by itself. Then
it may camp on a large share of the re
maining floor area. The figures cannot
' be given now.
Til.- plans for the California display
I will be rapidly developed, and when an
nounced will be found to include some
unique features, some of which must wait
1 for approval; There will be a pyramid of
asphaltum, a great number of enlarge i
photographs, 22x2$ inches, illustrating
every phase of mining; probably a minia
ture stamp mill operating on ore, and oth
er things that will attract universal at
tention. The mineralogical display will
include every mineral occurring in the
, State. The California exhibit cannot be
comprehensively labeled as such by big
signs, as under exposition rules the whole
will be the "United States exhibit," but
j each specimen or other will be labeled
! with the names of the State and mine or
: locality from which it comes, and most of
the State exhibit will be together. Califor
nia has thus before it its greatest oppor
tunity to advertise its mineral resources
' and mining Industry and opportunities.
The new strike in the tlwin mine, Cala
' veras County, turns out to be a bigger
' thing than was reported a week or two
ago. In its significance to the mining in
dustry along the mother lode it is the
, most important development in that great
; mining region in a good while. The al
most phenomenal success attending the
reopening of this long abandoned old
mine during the past two years has of
itself been a big thing for the mother
lode.
: The great body of good milling ore
I reached at depth by a new shaft, showing
â  it to be yet one of the richest mine-- along
I the" lode and indicating that the eld work-
I ings left millions in the unworked ground,
! was another demonstration that the moth,
er lode veins "go down" and that deep
mining will pay there. Th.- comparatively
recent developments of large bodies of
good ore at great depths in such reopened
mines as tin- Gwin, Kennedy, Argonaut.
Oneida and others increase faith in the
mother lode and encourage mining capi
talists, to do likewise. The result is and
will be the investment of miliums in deep
mining propositions on the mother lode.
But another significance of the new
strike in the Qwin is that it shows the
possibility of not only following the orig
inal veins to great depths profitably, but
that new and rich veins may be discov
ered at depth. The main vein in the Gwin
; dips easterly from 70 to 80 degrees. The
new vertical shaft was located so as to
cross the vein at over 1200 feeL It was
continued vertically downward, with the
usual plan of crosscut ling to the vein at
different levels, and two weeks ago had
reached a depth of 1570 feet.
At this point a vein of ore was unex
pectedly encountered. It dipped about 77
degrees parallel to the main vein and 160
feel west of it. Three drill holes were
' at once put in and they showed thick-
I nesses of from 18 to -- inches. First sam-
I pies from the hanging wall side assayed
I 18972 and $12713. Drillings from the hole.
' went $9 71, $2129 and $17 57. It was from
I the developments at this stage that the
brief information in the press last week ;
: was based.
Later reports received by Secretary .1.
J. Crawford in San Francisco during the
past week from Assistant Superintendent
! David McClure show that at ten feet
j more of depth the vein was widening and
| its average value being sustained. In his
report of last week Mr. McClure says:
"The shaft was sunk ten feet the past
week, making the total depth 1585 feet. At
â  a depth of 1578 feet ore was encountered
in the west or foot wall side of the shaft.
It extends the whole length of the shaft,
having the same dip and parallel to the
east or main ledge, which is about 180
feet to the east. It has a good gouge on
both foot and banging walls. The foot
wall is blackish gray slate and the hang
ing wall is pudding stone rock, although
at present there is a filling of about two
â¢ feet of black slate, with quartz stringers
â  betweeen the hanging wall side of the
quartz and the pudding wall. The hang
! ing or pudding wall is very even and Is
; slickenside polished across the shaft. The
! ore is hard, compact sulphuretted ribbon
' quartz, with an average thickness of two
I feet, carrying coarse free gold, and may
be classed as high grade rock, milling say
$15 per ton. We have been making a
| number of assays of various samples
I taken and all our sample assays of the
ore have been high. We picked the ore
down an average thickness of two feet
the whole length of the shaft and took
a 100-pound sample, using care in crush
ing, handling and assaying. The assay
obtained from this sample was $27 90. It
ls my opinion that we have found a west
ledge parallel to our main east ledge."
Greatness has come to the Gwin since
Senator Voorhies, F. F. Thomas and the
j Belshaws bought the 1400-foot water hole
i from the Gwin estate at a bargain about
I three years ago. The new shaft devel
oped a strong body of good milling ore,
of which Superintendent Thomas esti
mates there is 120,000 tons, averaging from i
; $6 to $7. already in sight. A small streak
iof phenomenally rich ore was found i
nearly two years ago, and a large body I
of $15 ore was recently struck In the main
vein. Twenty stamps were recently or- j
dered added to the twenty now dropping,
; and the new mill will be ready in Octo- I
ber. Further enlargement of the plant is ]
probable. The company recently reorgan
ized as the Gwin Mine Development com
pany, with an increased capital stock of
I $1,000,000. C. S. Benedict and D. W. Hy
land added to the capital available. The
stock is held above par, and is not for
sale.
The greatest and most interesting deep
mining operation going on along the lode
is that at the Kennedy, already the deep
est gold mine in the United States (over
2400 feet). The present shaft Is on the In
cline A new triple-compartment vertical
shaft has been started 1900 feet from the
old shaft. It is calculated that if the vein ;
preserves Its present dip it will be cut at
the great depth of 8500 feet. The shaft
i may nave to go deeper to reach the vein,
and how much further it may go will de
; pend on future developments down there.
I The new shaft is being driven with en
ergy and skill, and its record will be of
' much interest to the mining world. It
i has reached about 400 feet, and it will be
! a good while before the contemplated
depths are attained.
On the 1900-foot level a crosccut will be
I run from the old shaft to the line of the
new one, and from there the new shaft
j will be driven upward as well as. down
\ ward. When the new shaft is completed
â  to the 1900-foot level the mine will be
worked through It while sinking contin- I
! ues. Other lower crosscuts will be run,
! and the dip and nature of the vein will ,
ibe kept track of by crosscuts as the ;
i shaft goes below the deepest present I
i workings. At 2400 feet the Kennedy has a j
large- and rich body of ore. and there is j
I no circumstance or reason to warrant a |
, belief that the mineâ and the whole lodeâ
j will not display as good bodies of ore at ,
' 4000 or 5000 feet as at 1000 or 2000 feet.
The profitable working of the Kennedy ;
I at 3500 or 4000 feet would be the biggest
| advertisement throughout the world that
! the mother lode has ever had. At; 3500
feet, where it Is planned to first reach the
vein, the mine will exceed the world s
present record for gold mining, that or j
3000 feet in the Ballarat mines in Aus- ,
tralia, by 500 feet, though much greater
depths have been reached In other mines.
The Kennedy enterprise is the boldest op
i eration known to California Quartz mm- !
' ing, which needs boldness, faith and
money, along with good judgment. The
Kennedy company assumes that there is
a large quantity of pay ore more than
1000 feet lower than the deepest gold-mine ;
workings in America, and hundreds lower
than the deepest in the world; and on c
that proposition it gambles an investment :
that will reach into the hundreds of
thousands. v . ;
A new mineral has been added to Call- j
i fornia's big share of this natural king
dom It is corundum. Years ago Baron
Rlchtofen thought he observed corundum
crystals in some Los Angeles Count.
'â  gravel, but no specimen was ever Identi
fied and preserved, and that doubtful re
port was the only one ever scientifically
given. 'â¢â¢'â ': , _ .
But now it has really turned up. J. A.
Edman has found a deposit in places in
Plumas County and last week Curator
j Durden of the State Mining Bureau Muse- ,
: urn received from him and displayed some
! specimens. Mr. Edman is a miner and
mineralogist who has operated a mine
lin Plumas County for some years. He
! recently discovered the crystals in white
feldspar at the edge of a porphyry' dike
near Meadow Valley, Plumas County. \
: The largest measured about three-fourths j
by two and a half Inches.
The discovery is probably of more scien- i
tific than ecomonic importance. The pres
ent commercial production of corundum
is confined to North Carolina. In 1897 the :
yield was 230 tons, but the industry is not
profitable. Corundum is used as an!
abrasive for grinding, polishing, etc., as ,
is garnet and emery, but its use is now >
greatly lessened by the superior though
more expensive artificial product called :
carborundum. Corundum sells for from
. 5 to 10 cents per pound, according to form
and quality and carborundum at from |
! S to 15 cents. A large deposit, easily :
worked and cheap transportation would
be required for profit. Corundum, like j
â  emery, sapphire and other minerals and ,
gems, is crystallized alumina.
R. H. Postlethwaite, the gold dredge |
I inventor and operator, is experimenting ,
with a novel way of inspecting bedrock
after the dredge buckets have scraped it. |
Dredge buckets cannot dig gold out of >
crevices and little holes, and in dredging
, it is well to know about the gold left on j
! the bedrock. The contrivance is a tube |
with an electric light on the inside near]
the lower end and shaded from above. J
The tube is sunk in the muddy water to j
bedrock, filled with air at sufficient pres- j
sure to keep out the water. The strongly
! illuminated bedrock can be seen by look- I
ing down th" tube, and by moving it about
the bedrock is explored. It is propose- to
suspend the tube from the front of the
dredge for frequent use.

- tent possible to him, and he writes as
follows:
"I have been able to learn practically i
1 nothing about mining except that in the !
i provinces of Camarines there exist quite
a number of large, well developed quartz
veins In gneiss that show as high as ten
to twelve feel width of clean quarts im
pregnated with auriferous pyrites of
both ci pper and Iron and that also much |
tetrahederite, some oxide and still more
carbonate Is found back of the coast in
the more remote hills, all said to be
auriferous and some argentiferous. I have I
been shown specimens of both coarse and i
steel galena found as float in large quan- j
tities, but it is said that no effort has
been made to trace up the veins. North- |
crn Luzon is rich in copper, many native I
masses of which have been shown here.
"The. military situation is such that it
is impossible to verify all these reports, !
and the Spaniard is so consistent and per
sistent a liar that you naturally conclude I
that he avoids the truth on all occasions. !
: There is much lignite coal of a very good
quality scattered all through the group,
' with some veins partly developed at Can- !
tanduanes by the Gil brothers, who sell i
1 it to trading steamers at about $13 (Mcx- j
ican) per ton. the cost of extraction to
them being about $4 (Mexican) per ton.
Mines here promise to be very wet as the
rainfall is great and the country* a huge
sponge. Some attempts at coal digging
had to be abandoned by Spaniards, who
use no pumps, on some coal prospects :
I near Albay dipping 30 degrees into the
hill.
"Miners would better stay out of this I
i country for at least a year after the na- !
! tives surrender, for bands of so-called
Tulizanes will be the result of the break- :
Ing up of the Filipino armies. They are
bands of robbers that Spain was never
able to suppress. They rob and kill im
partially, and their capture In the hills j
and jungles is rather uncertain. The peo
pie of these islands will never be ef- j
ficient workmen, for while extremely in
telligent they are lazy, proud and treach
: erous, and could give Judas cards and j
; spades. After all said and done, the tak
ing of these islands, I sincerely think, will j
be a bitter day for the United States."
The Los Angeles Times says that there I
is more prospecting being done on the j
â¢ desert now than during any year since the
discovery of the Randsburg mines. From
! Mojave on the west to the Colorado River

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Holland's naval budget for ISO. is $6,676.
--000, of which $1,775,000 is for the personnel
and $2,860,000 for new construction, ord
nance, torpedoes, etc.
The Belleville boiler is used ln 44 French
ships of war, 27 Russian. 52 British. 7
Japanese. 2 Austrian and one each in the
Spanish, Argentine, Chilean and Italian
navies.
The Argentine vessel of war lost last
month on the island of Blanca, in the
Camerone Bay, was the Villarino, an ord
nance transport of 1000 tons and alleged
to have a speed of twenty-five knots.
A British gunboat named the Gwendo
line has-been launched and commissioned
on Lake Nyanza. She is 130 feet in length,
ten feet longer than the German gunboat
Wiseman, which was hitherto the only
war vessel on this African lake.
During the approaching British naval
! maneuvers 118 war vessels and about 25.000
I men will participate. One of the principal
j objects of the maneuvers is to exhaust
] ively study the value of torpedo-boat de
â  stroyers, of which fifty-four are to be
; engaged.
The Majestic, British battleship, took
on board recently at Portsmouth dockyard
1530 tons of coal in fourteen hours. H.
previous records were 161 and 172 tons per
1 hour, but considering that this latest coal
j ing was done from one side only the per
j formance is excellent.
To guard against gas accumulating and
exploding in coal bunkers on board ship.
the British Admiralty has issued orders
to the. channel fleet that bunkers are to
be opened three hours daily for six days
after coaling. Thereafter they are to be
opened for periods twice a week.
Retirement ages of officers ln the French
navy were changed during the last days
of M. L-ockroy's administration, and are
; now as follows: Vice admirals at 65, rear
! admirals changed from 62 to 60, captains
from 60 to 65; commanders 58 to 50 and
â¢ lieutenants from 53 to 45. This law is to
be gradually carried into effect, reaching
the last two grades in 1907. A new rank,
; corresponding to that of lieutenant com
mander in our navy, has also been es
! tablished, and 150 lieutenants taken from
' the head of seniority have been selected
! to become "lieutenants de vaisseauma
i jors."
The performance of the Japanese tor
pedo-boat Akebone was six runs over
the measured mile, during which the
highest speed was 31.226 knots and the
lowest 31.08, making an average of 31.159
knots. The vessel was launched April
24 and made her trial ten days later.
One peculiarity about the construction
of the Akebone is that in the riveting of
the upper strakes the heads of the rivets
are not countersunk, but left projecting
over the plate. This supports the plate
and tends to stiffen it against any Inclina
tion to buckle, which latter is quite likely;
to happen in boats of that type where tha
thickness of plates has been reduced to
the utmost limit of safety.
Several types of water-tube boilers hava
been tested ln the German navy, notably
the Niclausse (French), the Schultz (Ger
man) and the Thornycroft (English), and
the latter has been adopted for the ships
under construction. The experience With
the new style of boilers has been costly
and caused several accidents and much
annoyance on board German naval ves
sels. The cruiser Hertha, for example,
which accompanied the yacht Hohenzol
lern up the Mediterranean when the Em
peror visited Palestine, could not keep up
with the yacht, notwithstanding tho
Hertha was rated at twenty-one knots
speed, against the Hohenzollern's eighteen
knots. One stoker died from exhaustion
and several sailors were incapacitated
during the voyage owing to lack of air
supply In the firerooms. The Hertha was
finally taken to Genoa, where, at an ex
pense of $100,000. the most glaring defects
were remedied. Another case is that of
the Gazelle, fitted with Niclausse boilers.
Her trials were unsatisfactory and tho
entire arrangement of her boilers has now
to be reorganized, which will take at least
six months and cost many thousand dol
lars. The chief complaint and defect ap
pears to be excessive heat in the firerooma
and lack of ventilation. It is presumed
that the Navy Department will have the.
latter important factor in efficiency thor
oughly studied out in the installation of
the Niclausse boiler in the battleship
Maine and likewise in the Raleigh. In tha
latter ship the heat in the fireroom ran
up to 170 degrees, making It unendurable
for the firemen and engineers.

JESUS THE JEW I GIiERQy ON l^qipSOLlj J JUBILEE OF TRINITy
JESUS WAS A JEW
AMONG THE JEWS
Celebrated Lecture of
H. Weinstock in Y.
M. C. A. Hall.
H. WEINSTOCK LECTURING ON ".JESUS THE JEW."
THE auditorium of the Young Men's
Christian Association building, on
Mason street, was filled to "stand
ing room only" with the audience
that gathered yesterday afternoon
to listen to the address of H. Weinstock,
who had come down from his home
in Sacramento for the express purpose of
delivering his celebrated lecture. "Jesus
'^c Jew."
I To the observer it was not the magnl
le of the audience, great as that was,
that struck him most forcibly. It was its j
â¢nposition. . Jewish rabbi and Christian
minister sat side by side and listened to
discourse that evoked repeated bursts
applause from appreciative Catholic, i
stestant and Hebrew. All creeds were j
iresented and every sect found some
ng in the masterly and liberal lecture
approve of and indorse.
Ir. Weinstock spoke to the followers
no particular religion; he appealed to â 
i communicants of no particular faith; I
i efforts were directed alike to Jew and
utile, and his object was to plead for
the universal brotherhood of man, with
t one God to watch over and he wor
iped by all. Mr. Weinstock spoke as
lows:
king back into my early boyhood
vs the picture Is vividly brought to my
nd of the old rabbi under whose in
action 1 received my religious training, ;
I recall upon one occasion how one of
> pupils in me way brought into the
religious school a book containing the ,
me of Jesus. I remember when this
was made known by some other lad who
had noticed it with what indignation the
rabbi spoke, and how he regard the act
as most sacrilegious and deserving of the â 
severest .sure. .
I remember how aroused and impas
sioned he became while recounting th?
frightful sufferings md calamities which
had been visited upon the Jews, for all of
which, in his opinion, Jesus was pri
marily responsible. 'How, then," he con
cluded, "could any self-respecting, loyal
Jew take into his hand . en a book con
taining the name of Jesus? How could
the name of Jesus he thought of without
connecting it in the mind of the Jew with
the centuries of human outrage and
persecution visited upon him by the fol
lowers of Jesus?"
Jesus Christ as a Jew.
For many years these utterances and
teachings clung to my mind, and doubt
less had their influence in warping my
thoughts and coloring my opinions. I
could not but sympathize with the feel- j
ings and sentiments â¢â : my people, and in l
common with my orthodox teacher feel
within mv heart and soul that the badge'
of suffering had been placed upon the
Jew by the words and acts of Jesus. All
this I felt before I had had an opportu
nity to read and to think for myself be
fore the words and the deeds and the sen
timents of the Nazarene were known to i
me. In time the life of the man from
Galilee became to me of profound Inter- |
est; I read the story of ids life as told in i
the Xew Testament; I read the conception
of Jesus as portrayed by Borne of the I
ablest modern Jewish and Christian j
scholars; I carefully studied his utter
ances as presented in the gospel - and
the picture of this great and wonderful
character grew to me to be a very dif- j
fcrent one from that painted by my ven
erable and pious but uninformed Hebrew j
teacher. I found that, according to New
Testament traditions. Jesus was born a i
Jew. lived a Jew, died a Jew. I found that
he preached nothing but Judaism in its ]
purest and simplest form. I found that |
the thought of establishing a new belief, i
or even a new sect, was farthest from his j
mind, that his aim was not to ' follow
after the heathens, but to seek out the
lost sheep of the house of Israel. I found
that his mission seemed to be to uplift
the lowly and to expose wickedness in
high places. I found that he gave his
heart, his soul, and his very being to the
poor, to the sick and to the needy. He
said: "I am not come to heal the sound;
I have been sent unto the sick." I founds,
that he was a man of unbounded sympa
thies and of great moral courage, that he
was simply striving to practice and to
preach the moral code established by
Moses and the prophets, and to literally
put into practice in his daily life the great
law-giver's precept of "love thy neighbor
as thyself." I found his teachings con
sisted chiefly In preaching:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit.
"Blessed are they that mourn.
"Blessed are the meek.
"Blessed are they that hunger and
thirst after righteousness.
"Blessed are the merciful.
"Blessed are the pure in heart.
"Blessed are the peacemakers.
"Blessed are they which are persecuted
for righteousness' sake."
I found these were .-ci 1 Jewish teachings
reduced to a clear and simple form, which
the most orthodox and pious Jew could
not but accept as a part of his own faith.
Why, then, was it that, as the outcome
of such ethical Jewish utterances, the
Jew should ha-. been so mistreated by
the followers of Jesus and Jesus so much
contemned by the Jews?
Then followed, on my part, a study of
Christianity and the causes which led to j
Jewish persecution. It took but little
reading to learn that Paul, the Grecian
Jew, and not Jesus, was the real founder
of Christianity; that Paul was the man
who conceived the Idea of spreading Juda
ism among the gentiles by preaching the
God of Israel and the man Jesus' the son
!of God. I found it was Paul's heroic
qualities which enabled him. despite the
severest persecution from Jew and gen
: tile, to surround himself with a large fol
j lowing, not of Jews alone, but of heathens
as well, who became believers in the Jew
ish. God and worshipers of the Jewish
carpenter Jesus, whom they accepted as
the son of God sent upon earth to save
the human family.
Judaism Sought Not Converts.
Judaism never went out to proselyte
among strangers: its followers had so
i much faith in the truth which it taught
! that the; patiently waited for strangers
| through their own convictions to come of
j their own accord and knock for admission
'at the doors of Judaism. Xot so with
j Paul; his Idea was to unite the whole hu
man race under one belief. He soon real
ized, however, how hopeless the task,
: should he insist upon the observance upon
the part of the heathen of the severe and
rigid ceremonialism of the Jew. To Paul
the spirit was all in all, the form noth
) ing. Not that Paul loved the letter of the
law ess but that he loved the spirit of
his religion still more. He clearly saw
: that the Apostles of Jesus, by their un
â  willingness to let one jot or tittle pass
from the law, would permit the spiritual
wave to die out which Jesus had created.
j Paul saw a magnificent opportunity to
spread among the millions of heathens the
i beautiful truths of Judaism. But he real
ized that this could be done only by ig
> noring the letter of the Jewish law and
by preaching Its spirit. Thus, from
j the very beginning do we find that
much which was done by Paul and others
; in the name of Jesus was done of their
own volition, against the manifest spirit
! and teachings of Jesus, and for which he
should not be held responsible. No one
deplores the savage and cruel persecution
carried on in the name of Jesus to which
1 for hundreds of years the Jew was sub
jected more than does the intelligent
Christian of to-day, who looks upon the
record of priestly crime and bloodshed, of
religious torture and outrage, as a blot
on the fair name of Christianity and a
stain on the memory of the gentle Xaza
zene.
The Jew of to-day resents the idea of
being held responsible for the crucifixion
of Jesus. The Jew of to-day must not,
therefore, bold the memory of Jesus re
sponsible for acts committed by h.s blind
ed followers after Ids death, and in vio
lence to his teachings of non-resistance.
Imagine, if you can, this gentle teacher
in Israel coming baCK to life and seeing
his Catholic follower burning at the stake
his Protestant follower, all in the name
of Jesus: or, imagine him returned to
earth and finding both his Catholic and
Protestant worshipers persecuting in his
'â¢ name the members of the faith in which
1 he was born and lived and diedâ persecut-
I ing his own brethren whom he loved, and
for whom he stood ready to make any
sacrifice. What, think you, would be his
feelings? Unless his spirit was very dif
ferent from the one given him by his dis
ciples such scenes would rack and ais
tract him. To feel himself the innocent
cause for the shedding of innocent blood
would make him cry' out in tne agony of
j his soul and to stretch out his hands in
I the attempt to stop the murderous work
I going on In his name. If he could come to
' life again and learn of the myriads of
! helpless men and women who, in his
j name, have been racked and tortured and
! put to horrible deaths, he would bemoan
i the hour that first gave him birth, and
i feel himself to have been a blighting curse
! where he had hoped to be a blessing.
I Christianity and Judaism are supple
; mental to each other. Had there been no
I Judaism there could have been no Chris
j tianity. Had there been no Christianity
I the message of Judaism could not have
i become so speedily universalized. There
; is ample room in this broad world for the
followers of both beliefs to accomplish.
Bide by side, a most heroic religious and
I moral work.
it is not necessary that Jew shall be
come Christian, nor that Christian shall
become Jew; each in his own way can be
true to his faith and can continue to ob
: serve the laws of God as he understands
; themâ to worship his creator in accord-
I ance with the dictates of his own con
science. Both may continue to live side
hy side in peace and in harmony, respect
j ing each other's beliefs, manifesting the
fullest tolerance for each other's religious
opinions, giving each other credit for good
intentions, loving each other for their vir
tues and casting the mantle of charity
over each other's failings. ' ' " v' â '"â¢
May Jew and christian continue to seek
out the many beliefs they have in com
mon and to join hands in working to
gether for common humanity.
A Liberal Spirit Necessary."
May the Christian continue to preach
and to practice the ethics of Judaism
as set forth in the Old as well as in the
New Testament. May he strive to elimi
â¢ nate from Christianity the elements of
! paganism grafted Into it during Its earlier
history, and may his doctrines become
â  still more purified and brought back to ;
. the pure and simple belief taught by the
| humble carpenter from Galilee.
May each of us. ln our own way, strive
I to fulfill the noble teachings of our be-
I liefs and to aim to live in accordance
i with the many lofty and beautiful truths
I imbibed at the breast of Judaism by the
I Nazarene and by Paul, which they gave
i back to the world clothed in a newer and
brighter form.
May we, as Jews, and you, as Chris
tians, in this spirit, learn to truly love
our neighbors as ourselves, and, by ex
ample as well as by precept, become na
tions of priests and a blessing to the
human family.

bers "1813" and "1899." All behind the
chancel rail was a waving mass of green
and white.
On the right pillar of the tenth transept
was placed the beautiful memoria. tablet
to the founders of the church. This tab
let, on which is inscribed In quaint Old i
English characters the names of the forty |
pioneer members, was given by the vestry
men to common-orate the founding of the
church on its fiftieth anniversary. The
tablet is curved to fit the pillar, and is
divided into two panels by Gothic tracery.
The surface is raised to form the letters of
the names, and upon it Biblical symbols
are in scrolls. The tablet is Inscribed as :
follows:

The vestry of Trinity Church consists

Boyd The stately ivy-covered house of j
worship numbers among its congregation
many of the leading people of San Fran
cisco's social life, and the brilliant throng
that attended yesterday presented a
spectacle that will not soon be forgotten.
At the morning services, after a few in
troductory remarks by Bishop Nichols,
C V S. Gibbs, the last survivor of the ,
founders of Trinity Churcn. delivered a j
most interesting address. Identified with
the church from its infancy, his remarks j
were listened to with intense Interest.
Mr Gibbs spoke of the first days of the |
church, beginning with the little building !
on Jackson street; then of the iron â¢
church on' Pine street, where the Califor- j
nia Market now stands. He passed over ;
its history at Powell and Post streets, I
and then dwelt on the recent six years in
Its present permanent home. He told of |
the pioneers, of their earnestness of pur- j
pose and their sterling character. Mr.
Gibbs strongly decried the proposition
that all the pioneers were rough and ;
brutal men.
His discourse was replete with interest
to the large audience, and it is of such
value to the church that it will be print- j
ed and bled in its archives.
At the afternoon services, which are 'â¢
now regularly held at 4 o'clock. Bishop
Nichols delivered a short sermon. He
spoke on the subject of "Some Memories
of the Founders of Trinity Church," re
ferring especially to the work and life
of Rev. Mr. Mines, the first pastor.
The music, which was rendered by the
regular choir under Professor H. J. Stew
art, was grand and inspiring. The thrill
l Ing anthems were feelingly interpreted by 1
the singers, the Communion service, by
Stainer, attracting especial attention.
DR. GIBSON SAYS
RELIGION IS EASY
Rev. J. G. Gibson of Emmanuel Baptist
Church took the text for his Sunday even
ing sermon from Matthew, xl:30: "My
yoke is easy and my burden is light." His
discourse in brief was as fallows:
In the highest sense it pays to be good. The
best life is the easiest life. I have known many
young men, but I never knew the good ones to
have so much trouble as the bad ones. Satan's
yoke is not easy. Every young man finds this
out who wears it.
A few sad-eyed people make the young peo
ple believe that the religious life is an un
happy one. Ministers may dress in black
[ clothes. That is their misfortune. My experi
ence is enough for me and my knowledge of
I those lives that have not been religious. I
I think it is easier and happier to be a follower
j of Jesus than the devil.
That popular education is appreciated
in Japan is evident from the fact that its
elementary schools are attended by 3,700,
--000 pupils.

San Francisco 11, Oakland 6.
Time was called at the end of the eighth
inning in the game between Oakland and \
San Francisco played on the Golden Gate
grounds yesterday mornirg. It was of the j
fireworks pattern, and so much time was
consumed In chasing the ball that the j
game could not be terminated. the play- '.
ers being forced to return to the city
for the afternoon match.
Stefani and Fitzpatrlck were easy marks
for the opposing teams, nine and eleven
hits being made off their respective de
liveries. Hammond had the honor of
making the first honest home run on tne
grounds. The ball did not sail over either
of the fences, but went into the angle at
far center. There was a plethora of dou
bles and singles which played hand In
hand with bunches of Oakland errors to
give Frisco eleven runs.
The seventh was the great inning, and
it brought Patsy Cahill. the umpire, Into
eternal disrepute with the Suburban
Dudes. His decision riddled holes in a
triple play and made of It a double. Sul
livan was on third, Riley on second and
Swindells on first. Pyne stepped up to the
plate and drove a hot grounder over Bee
ond, which Donovan fielded, He threw to
second and Swindells died. Riley was
caught at the plate and quick as a flash
Hammond threw to Hutchinson on first.
It was lightning work, and Pyne and the
hall had a hot race. Cahill allowed Pyne
to top the first bag.
Of course it Look. like an out to every
Oakland rooter, especially as Cahill had
' given some questionable decisions before
this play. Pyne lived to score and Oak
land's bleeding heart received another
fc Caliill had a most unpleasant time of it
ill had a most unpleasant time of it
throughout the game. The Oakland popu
lation gathered on the fence that lines
the field and what they didn't say to Ca- (
hill and every member of the home team
would not fill a primer.

SAN" JOSE, July 23. The Watsonville
babies turned the tables on the local team
in the game played here to-day and won
out by a score of 11 to 4. Both teams
produced very ragged ball, but the home
team was far the worst. Several of the
best players became rattled in the third
inning and did not steady throughout the
game. Neither Harper nor Andrews was
in stood form, and hits and bases on balls
were quite plentiful. Score:

SP O RTS OF THE DAY
ANGLERS IN QUEST OF STRIPED BASS.
Harrowing Tab
Being Tofd of Ad
ventures With
Big fish.
THE unusual run of striped bass in
the waterways around the Encinai
has been severely trying on the
veracity of the Alameda fisherman.
The fish are of good size and ex
cellent eating. From the stories
told by those who have defied the sun's
rays in open boats and undergone other
hardships! in an endeavor to hook them
they have a remarkable faculty of In
creasing in weight at an astounding rate
from the time they are hauled out of the
BETS DECLARED
OFF ON A RACE
AT UNION PARK
Koolawn Runs as if
Drugged.
The shadow of a scandal hangs over
one of the races run yesterday at Union
Coursing Park. An investigation has been i
ordered, which may result in the ruling
off the field of D. Hooper and his grey
hound Koolawn.
In the second round of the Reserve ,
stake she met V. Guerrero's Silence and
was installed a pronounced favorite in ;
the betting. When the pair of dogs left
the hands of Slipper Wren, Koolawn, who
on public form should have led up and
won, was seen to stagger" and reel about
the field. She finally went in pursuit of
the hare, and in turning stumbled and
fell. Four times in all she fell heavily
before finally killing. Judge Bull signaled
that the white flag, under which Silence
was running, had won.
In the meantime the officials of the
park, noting the condition of Koolawn.
declared all bets off. This prompt action
proved highly popular with the specta
tors, the announcement being received
with applause. The opinion was freely
expressed, however, by the coursing men
that this action was illegal, as in all
sports bets go with the decision of the
referee, in this instance Judge Bull. Many
of the bettors destroyed their red tickets
upon seeing the white flag go up. Some
of the red tickets presented for redemp
tion were torn, in some instances only a
portion of the pasteboard being retained.
It is expected this incident will result
in a definite understanding of the rules as
to when and by whom Lets may be de
clared off. __ _
D J Healey s For Glory and Grenada
divided the "Reserve stake, not being
called upon to run off. For Glory's hard
est course was in the next to the final
race, when she met Firm Friend. For
Glory led up and then the Pasha Kennels'
representative was on the hare and rap
idly ran up an imposing score to the .Ni
dent delight of those who were betting 1
to 3 he would win. For Glory finally got
in and the hare lasted just long enough
for her to win.
In the puppy stake O'Hara won from
Controller after a desperate race. The
hare proved a strong one, and it was
found necessary to release a third dog to
kill it, and thus save the lives of the dogs
racing. The hare was still strong and led I
the three dogs some distance before they
finally killed. O'Hara was then drawn,
the stake going to Daisy Clair by default.
The coursing throughout the day was
high class and the attendance largo.
Mac's Melody was favorite for the He
serve stake, but was put out by For
Glory, a 1 to 2 shot. Grenada beat O X
Capitol after a no-go. The hare favored
Grenada. The detailed results of tho
coursing follow: v-.-.v

The best catches have been made in
San Leandro Pay, between the Pay Farm
Island bridge and the narrow gauge
trestle, and in the estuary from the mouth
of the tidal canal to the Alameda Boat
Club house. Sundays the bay and estuary
are dotted with the small boats of ama
teur fishermen, while crowds of sports
men with rods and reels line the shores.
Few of them retire without a catch of
some kind. By actual figures the bass
average in weight about ten pounds, al
though none of the amateur fishers will
admit that they have caught any so light.
The twenty-five and thirty pounders are
the only kind they tell about.

claims to have caught the biggest of the
fish in the bay. Patrolman Fred Bramp
ton asserts that his ten-year-old son
caught -the only game bass of the season
off the foot of the Alameda Boating Club.
The fish, it is claimed, showed fight and
was pulling the boy Into the water when
his father rushed to his rescue and caught
him just as he went overboard.
Frank Browning had the most harrow
ing experience of any of those who find
sport in the quest of striped bass. He
went out in an open boat into San Lean
dro Bay and fell asleep waiting for a bite.
The sun scorched his face until he looked
like a cast-off russet shoe. He was forced
to take a vacation from his official duties
until nature provided him with a new
outfit of facial cuticle. Local sportsmen
who have made good catches are: Everett
Harris, Senator Taylor, Dr. Riehl, Wil
liam Steinbeht. James Colgrave, Jesse
Rogers and George Frier.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, July 23.â A1l the morning pa.
pers publish editorials expressing con
gratulations upon the immense success
of the athletic meeting at the Queen's
Club on Saturday and expressing the hope
thai it will not be the last of such con
tests. All compliment the members of
the American team upon their splendid
performances.
The Daily Graphic thinks the climate
had something to do with the result and
says: "It is easy to believe the rumor
that Illness was the cause of Harvard's
record-holder in the half-mile event run
ning far below his form."
The Standard says: "Any hostility
which may have ever existed between the
two peoples has been owing to their ig
norance of each other, and nothing is
better calculated to remove it than such
meetings as that of Saturday. Diplomacy
and commerce create jealousies quite as
often as they remove them, while noth
ing but good is likely to result from the
social approximation which is now
springing up between those in whose
hands will be the shaping of the \rarl"-
Saxon race. We trust the meetings may
take firm root as annual gathering-.
The Daily Telegraph says: "Both :oun
tries ought tec be proud of their represent
atives. Such scenes are- worth going
miles to see, not solely for their own sake,
but for all they imply .â :' keen, brothei'ly
competition between two sections of the
Anglo-Saxon race."
Dealing with the defeat of the much
dreaded Burke, the Daily Telegraph says
it is only fair to admit that he was by no
means in good trim.
The Daily Chronicle says: "If interna
tional athletic trials were common diplo
matists might be driven to move a peace
conference to lay an embargo on them.
Jaundiced observers on the Continent who
hope for a breach of the Anglo-American
understanding will not find It at the
Queen's Club. Harvard and Yale are
shorter in the wind than Cambridge, but
Thor himself might be jealous of Boal of
Harvard."
The Times says: "Englishmen would not
have grudged the Americans their tri
umph in the least degree if the fortunes
had been reversed. As it Is, they will feel
that a victory Is a very little thin?; com
pared with the pluck and sportsmanlike
spirit displayed by both sides, and with
the friendly relations between the two
branches of the Anglo-Saxon ra.ee. of
which they trust this match is a tohen."
The sporting papers are unusually en

SOCIETY JUST
DOTES ON THAT
CAKE WALKING
Enough of Abandon to
Be Acceptable.
â â
MAY BE A CHARITY WALK
â â¢ â
MR. DALTOX'S GAIT SAID TO BE
UNSTEADY.
One of His Explanations Has Failed
to Explain â Central Improvement
Club Gets Off With the
Right Foot.
â â â¦
Oak'.ar.d Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, July _}.
Oakland society is smitten with the
Cakewalk craze. This is apparent every
where â in private residences and at sum
mer resorts, is well as in camps. It has
:-. accented as the correct thing, and
iic-miire dames vie with young damsels
In performing the fantastic walk to rag-
T.ast r.ieh: at Haywards, w-here many
â ; - tble people are gathered, a cake
walk was indulged in. which has been the
cnl> topic of conversation for the week.
Banker C. E. Palmer invented a new
Etep. Many Oakland society leaders and
s:-me who are not leaders were partici
pants; ar.el some or* the elegant contor
tions, distortions and genuflections would
have made a Georgia Cakewalk party
blush with envy. Somehow or other the
cakewalk has enveloped itself in a giddi
ness and prudent abandon that has struck
a popular desire. Society was just wait
ing for a ragtime era. and the Cakewalk
has given ail the excuse necessary to
bring It about.
Even the models of propriety that arc
supposeei to grace Castle Crag have
ad utcrd the Cakewalk as a means of
breaking the monotony of social life. At
this mountain resort Horace Miller is
credited with carrying off the honors.
A party of prominent Oaklanders were
go imbued with the cakewalk craze that
they carried it to the East with them,
and" a social letter from Shelter Island
tells of an interesting ceremony in which
2. dozen couples took part. Amonj the
names of the revelers were Miss Marion
Goodfellow and H. O. Trowbridge. wh_
walked off with the prize. The informa
tion says that "the whole thing was car-
ried out in true darkey style, and wound
up with cake, lemonade and root beer."
Others who were there were Miss Jaoue
ilne Moore and several other Oaklanders.
It ls now suggested that the Associated-
Charities being in such dire need of as
sistance, it would be highly proper for
Oakland society to organize a series of
cakewalks at the Exposition building for
Its benefit. There are many clever peo
ple within the ,-iided circle who could cut
quite a caper to ragtime music in app:v>
rnate attire. In fact, some of the Oak
land girls have on more than one occa
sion proved their ability to do what would
I â -â¢ least expected of them, and after a
F^sgn of golf, yachting parties and â .ma
teur cakewalks a grand exhibition for
"=weet charity" would be just the 1 .ing.
At last steps have been tak*-**. toward
obtaining a new city charter. It ls sur
prising how Oakland has struggled with
the present cumbersome and -intricate
law for so long. It can only have been
possible because of the indifference of
her citizens and the desire of the active
politicians to have a charter that wou â
permit of all kinds of dubious acts an<i
make it impossible to fix the responslbibty
for them on any one party or official. Not
until the Board of Works was wiped out
by the Legislature four years ago as a
separate department of the city govern
ment was it seen how much stupidity and
contradiction marked the city charter. a
thousand times during the past four years
have instances arisen which have caused
much delay in needed work, simply be
cause tho cumbersome charter made such
delays necessary or possible.
It vlll not be an easy matter to frame
a new charter. There are too many peo
ple interested In preserving the present
law. but this can hardly iter the sincere
reformers from going ahead. A charter
framed as nearly as possible on the lines
of the county government act is what
Oakland needs, for it ls very plain to all
who have business with th" city or the
county that there is not tenth of the
red rape or delay to be encountered in
transacting the county's business as is to
be found in dealing with the city of Oak
land.
Five years ago Oakland was to be j
emancipated from a water monopoly. The i
history of this fiasco is very fresh in the 'â 
public mind. Yesterday a deed was re
corded by which the promoters of the
Oakland Water Company transferred all j
their plant, franchise and business to the I
old monopoly, for the consideration of I
J5.160.0e00. "Reasonable interest" on this <
amount must be wrung from the taxpay
ers of this city, In addition to what was
required of them when the opposition
started. This fact should be of interest to '
those who are advocating the acquisition
Of a municipal water supply.
In spite of al the Silurians and mega
thoriums. Oakland is developing. While
politicians are making themselves ridicu- j
lous all over the city and braying at the I
anon, outside inv_st__Â» are a._i.U_- bi_J_u.
ing up the commercial interests of the
city. During the past month two very j
important improvements have been in
augurated on the water front, which mean
the permanent employment of two or
three hundred people, and not one-hun
dredth part of the publicity has been ac- |
corded them as has been given to the dif-
Acuities surrounding the reinstatement or
dismissal of Jimmy Brannan as a special
police officer.
The largest lumber concern in town can
not supply the demand, and between Tel- ;
and San Bablo avenues there is i
hardly a block on which new buildings j
are not being erected. There Is not an i
idle artisan in Oakland, and even the j
farmers have to advertise for sufficient ;
help to do their work.
The Central Improvement Club will un
doubtedly, if organized on the lines now
projected, be of more value to Oakland
than have been many of its City Coun
cils. The conservative and solid body of
men that met at the Merchants' Exchange
a few nights ago to lay the foundation of
the club are men who know what the city
needs. They come from, all the improve
ment clubs around the city, and there
was not a politician or a place-hunter
among them. They talked business and
business principles, and showed a spirit of
enterprise and a desire to promote public
improvement that presented a strong con
trast to the petty bickerings that distin
guish most of the gatherings of promoters
in Oakland. In a general way not one of
the delegates suggested that anything be
done spt-ciaily for the benefit of any par
ticular part of town. The idea was to
take hold of some big project and stay
with it till brought to a successful con
clusion; and the whole tenor of the meet
ing was that what benefited Oakland at
large must of necessity benefit all outside
territory.
There was one feature of the meeting
which was noted and commented upon.
It was the entire absence of any repre
sentative frcm the Lakeside Improvement
Club. This club gathered within itself
property owners who proclaimed that
they represented J16,"Â»T.CÂ».0 of taxable
property. With this immense leverage
they went before the last City Council,
did as they pleased and got all they asked.
It is possible that, being satisfied, the
I.akesiders have no interest in the work
of less opulent improvement clubs, but at
the next meeting some sort of an expla
nation regarding its absence at the first
gathering is expected.
The last week has been more hys
terical in a political way than the
week preceding an election. Just why
all the bombs should have been ex
ploded at this particular time is not easy
to say. but it is probably because they
have been bottled up since last Novem
ber, and the ret excuse for letting them
off has just been discovered.
Coroner Mehrmann and h;s celebrated
10,000-word speech brought one row to a
climax. The celebrated contract regarding
the Morgue caused another explosion, tnd
in the meantime somebody jumped on As
sessor Dalton and started an eruption in
his volcano. At the end of the week
everybody realized that there had been
"glorious victories" won; but. -like that
of Blenheim, it is difficult to say who has
gained most. It is far easier to se- who
has lost most.
Assessor Dalton seems now to have
found his political level. For several
years he was carried along on a wave of
popularity born of promises and of con
tracts. He promised to ride roughshod
over the corporations, and he continually
contrasted his doings w-ith those of his
predecessor. This stock in trade could not
last forever; and neither did It; and when
everything is sized up Mr. Dalton appears
as a fairly good normal Assessor. If his
predecessor favored the railroad property
and other corporate interests it Is no
credit to Mr. Dalton that he was not
guilty of the same thing. A man is no
more honest than his neighbor is dishon
est An official is expected to do n:s
whole duty; and he has no right to call for
a halo because he does what his alleged
faulty predecessur did not do. No one
doubts that there has been too much poll
tics centering in the Assessor's office, and
this has brought about the natural result
â opposition.
It is a pity that in addition to his local
difficulties Mr. Dalton should figure as
being responsible for holding back tne
pay of hundreds of teachers in this county
because he cannot arrive at a settlement
with the State Controller. The whole
sum in dispute is about WOO, and if Mr.
Dalton be right in retaining it he should
not suffer for hanging on to what belongs
to him If he be not titled to it, he must
justly suffer the political penalty. In any
event the unseemly quarrel should be ter
minated at once, so that the teachers can
be paid. In this connection some comment
ha- been caused that the Assessor, who
formerly employed a prominent Republi
can for his auorney. should now be taking
his legal advice from a Democrat, R. M.
Fitzgerald.
There is one item in Mr. Dalton's expla
nation of hi 3 assessment that has not so
far met with favor with the taxpayers.
It is his arbitrary reduction of $65,000 on
the San Pablo road. Mr. Dalton says that
he made this reduction because on March
1 he knew that the road was soon to bÂ«
wrecked and that th- roadbed, franchise
and stock were practically worthless; con
sequently he reduced the road from $70.
--500 to $5000. The roadbed was not touched
until the latter part of May, but was in
the same condition on March 1, IS9JK as on
March 1, liCÂ«5, and should have been as
sessed at the same figure. Mr. Dalton's
opponents say that if he be at liberty to
take official notice of what is to transpire
regarding personal property nearly three
months ahead, there is no reason why
he should not look i few weeks more
ahead and have beheld ln the San Pablo
road the high-class, thoroughly equipped
electric system which ls now in vogue and
have raised the assessment to double the
amount he placed upon it as an old cable
rt#d last year. This Is undoubtedly the
w<-akeÂ«=t spot In Mr. Daiton's administra
tion. STUART W*. BOOTH.

PROFESSOR LE CONTE
ON EARTH UPHEAVALS
BERKELEY, July 23.â Earthquakes In Southern California and a big
tidal wave on Lake Superior following so quickly on the heels of the
volcanic phenomena in Hawaii have set any number of people to think
ing that there might be a connection between these disturbances of the
eaFt pro feasor' Joseph Le Conte, head of the department of geology in the
University of California, Is not one of these. He is inclined to be very con
servative with respect to any possible connection between the three disturb
ances He declares that not only can there be no casual relation between the
three 'events but that it would also be absurd to imagine any ulterior cause
responsible alike for them all. While the disturbances seem to have happened
It the same time, so that on the face of It there would be some plausibility
in the idea of their connection, he prefers to look upon the connection as
rare.* accidental and In no wise indicating any general state of disorder or
Station under the earth's crust. In an interview to-night Professor Le
C Â° --I wdlfnot deny absolutely that there is something In the fact that these
three things have occurred as they have. But I have not the least particle of
faith or the least shadow of belief that they are in .any wise related one to
rbV other Th- grounds for holding to a disconnection between them are
much stronger than any which could be assumed to establish a relation.

the" are mountains of recent origin, comparatively, there are certain to be
volcanic eruptions and disturbances from time to time. Our own coast is

there could in no way affect conditions in California, or vice versa.

HAS SEEN FIRED
Agitation for a Park
in Oakland.
â â¦ â
THE MAYOR'S WORDS HEEDED
â â¦ â
rWENTY-THIRD AVENUE DIS
TRICT LEADS OFF.
â  â¦
Circular Issued Strongly Opposing
Adams Park Proposition and Fav
oring Purchase of Simson Tract
Near Mills Seminary.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
&)S Broadway, July 23.
The first gun in the bond campaign was
fired to-day by the Twenty-third i venue
District Improvement Club.
For the past two months Mayor Snow
has been addressing the various improve
ment clubs of this city, explaining: the ad
visability of his plan for the betterment
of the municipality and the practicabliity
of a bond issue for that purpose.
Under the caption of "A Park for Oak
land" the Twenty-third avenue club has
circulated throughout the city a letter
foidtr in strong opposition to the Adams
Park proposition. The circuiar leads off:
The people of Oakland want a park. Public
health demands it. Now that the people
are becoming interested In the subject of
a place for a public park, would it not be
well to look the matter squarely in the
face and decide on what is best for the
whole city, ignoring self-interest and the
present needs only, taking care when we
buy, that it shall be something that will
benefit th'ise who are to live here for all
... come, and procure a piace of not
less than a thousand acres, where extensive
drives can be had. where picnics can be
held, where associations can go, where there
is free water In abundance, where the view
is unequaled, and all this at a price which
the people con pay wlthuut feeling it to be
a burden?
The position taken by the East Oakland
-: - on the park proposition is next set
forth in the following paragraphs:
We as an association, are in favor of the
city of Oakland purchasing: land in the
North Oakland marsh and filling the same
by dredging from the hay, also improving
the West Oakland park and other improve
ments that the Central Ciub may agree
upon. We do not ask anything for the
Seventh Ward, but we do ask the >City
Council to call a hand election to issue
bonds for the purpose c f these improve
ments, and to buy what is known a* the
Slmson tract of 10C0 acres, which can be
bought for 5160 per acre.
The whole 1000 acres is under fence, and
afTorels splendid surroundings for extensive
drives. It is undoubtedly a most magnifi
cent and natural place for a park and one
which can bÂ» improved at a minimum c_st;
indeed at the sent time, a very small
cutlav would convert 2C-0 acres into a
pretty park, and the other Improvements
could be made as funds become available
fo- that purpose _'â -,'",
There are some people who say that it is
too far away; no r.r.e ir. his right mind who
has any comprehension of the future would
argue the question for a m'Dnier.t.
Now what does the Adams tract ofter? It is
low cold, subject to fogs and entirely un
suited for paik purposes ; it contains only
Bixty-two and one-half acres of land, no
water, no buildings, and the price asked
for it would buy the Simson tract with
good barns and houses suitable for all park
employees, would buy and beautify the West
Oak'and marsh, would fill all the low fever
producing lands of North Oakland ar.d
would make other improvements, w.-h
money left to commence Improving the
park, that future generations would bless
us for procuring for them.

A PLUCKY LANDLORD SAVES
HIS GUEST FROM DEATH
DRAGS HIM FROM A BURNING
BUILDING.
Gus Carlson, Lodging-House Keeper,
Severely Injured in Rescuing
Otto Bahrs.
OAKLAND. July 21â The New York
House, a cheap ten-room, two-story lodg
ing-house at 414-41*5 Seventh street, near
Broadway, was totally destroyed by fire
to-night, and the guests, among whom
were several poor old women, narrowly
escaped with their lives.
The fire was caused by the explosion of
a lamp, and by the time the fire appar
atus arrived the entire structure was in
flames. The guests were all rescued with
great difficulty, since the only hall exit
wa? like a burning furnace. Suddenly Gus
Carlson who conducts the house, remem
bered that a roomer named Bahrs had re
tired very much the worse for liquor, and
climbing" up a ladder at the rear of the
house he smashed the window, and rush
ing into the blazing room picked up the
man who was overcome with smoke, and
rescued him. Bahrs was slightly scorched
on his back. Carlson, in breaking the
window, cut his right wrist, severing
most of the main arteries.
The building, an old, dried-out struc
ture. Is owned by Mrs. Mary Kelley. The
damaere to house and furniture is esti
mated at about $1000, fully covered by in

a boy, who was passing through a dark
corridor of the City Hall, saw a man in
the act of striking a woman. She was on
her knees, begging him to go home with
her. He continued to strike her, how
ever, ar.d the boy. fearing that the man
intended to kill her. hurried to the Cen
tral station, where he informed Sergeant
Helms of what he had seen.
The setgeant sent Officer Cullinane to
the rescue. As the iceman neared the
spot to which he had been directed he saw
the woman still on her knees, pleading to
the man before her. rust as he was about
to answer her pleadings with another
blow the policeman seized him and start
ed with him for the Central station. The
woman followed them to the station, and
after announcing that the prisoner was
her husband begged that he be released.
â¢'lt is all a mistake," she explained, t.ie
tears coursing down her cheeks. "Don't
lock him up, or I shall go mad."
The prisoner proceeded to heap billings
gate on the head of the arresting officer.
Acting under orders from the sergeant in
charge Policeman Cullinane promptly es
corted his man to the City Prison, where
he was booked on a charge of drunken
ness. The husband gave the name of R.
A. Allen, but from cards found in his
pockets it was learned that he is Raoul
Auzerais of San Jose. The wife claim*
that he sent a note to her early in the
evening to meet him on McAllister street.
Afer a short conversation he Induced her
to enter the City Hall; where he attacked
her with his lists. She refused to assign
any reason for the assault, except to say
that iter husband was under the influence
of liquor and did not know what he % as
doing.
Auzerais started almost the moment he
was put into a cell to abuse several of
his rellow prisoners, and was badly
beaten about the face.
SWEDISH CITIZENS
ENJOY AN OUTING
NEAB.LY A THOUSAND PICNIC
AT SCHUETZEN PAHK.
Nearly a thousand Swedish-Americans
attended the third annual picnic of the
Swedish Dadies' Society at Schuetzen
Park yesterday. The exodus of Scandi
navians from the city began at 9:30 a m.,
and every boat that left the Tiburon
ferry slip from that time until 3:30 in the
afternoon carried a goodly number of
picnickers bound for the pleasure resort
across the bay. The programme at the
park consisted of a series of races in the
forenoon, a dance in the "Dig- pavilion in
the afternoon, bowling and lounging about
under the cooling shade of the trees and
in the arbors.
The day's sport began with the con
tests of speed between the youngsters,
for prizes, after which the elders took a
hand in the game and proved that they
could still get over the ground at a liveiy
rate. Following is a summary of the re
sults:
Girls" race, under 10 yearsâ Olga Olsen won,
Cora Tanner second.
Girls' race, 10 to 12 Adeline Brickiey
won, Verona Grodt second.
Boys' race. 10 to 12 yearsâ Sylvester O'Brien
won. George Gibson second. Leo Brickiey third.
La;-. members - raceâ Mrs. Gus Nelson won.
Miss Anna Johnson second, Mrs. Anna San
dahl third, Mrs. Thora Olson fourth.
Ladies' race, open to ail Mrs. M. Thorsenn
won Mis* Tekla Renstrom second, Mies Cora
Krutrr.eyer third. Mrs. Gus Nelson fourth.
Gents' race, social members â Alfred Schill
won Gus Nelson second. H. P. Fosl erg third.
Gents' running race â F. Esmond won, J.
Llevfrid second, Ed Klir.e third.
Music for the dancing was furnished by
Pihlstrom's band, and the following com
mittees had charge of the affair:
Committee on arrangementsâ Mrs. Otto Sjo
--*- Mrs Charles Armstrong. Mrs. Selma
Hanson. J. Wolf. F. O. Sjogren
Reception committeeâ Mrs. G. R. Lindberg.
Fred Nelson. Mrs. J J. Anderson, Mrs. Anna
Fandahl, Victor Sjogren, Mrs. Ch. Ander
son. Mrs. Mary Anderson.
Floor managerâ F. O. - - -.-a.
Floor committeeâ Mrs. Fred Nelson, Miss
Emelie Peterson, Hiss Friia Hanson, Mrs.
Mar)' Newberg.
A smooth-tongued bunko man held forth
at the little.depot near the park all the
afternoon and worked the shell game on
dozens of picnickers as they waited for
their trains to the city. The sure-thing
man must have cleaned up fully $500, as
he did a rushing business in a few minutes
preceding the departure of each train, and
no bet wa-s accepted for less than Jo.

THREATENS TO
END HIS LIFE
BY STARVATION
Edgar Garnett Again
Captured.
â â¦ â
ESCAPED FROM THE ASYLUM
â * â
HAD A RAZOR IN HIS POCKET
FOR SELE-DESTRUCTION.
â¢
His Hallucination Is That Society La
dies Are Enamored of Him
and He Annoys
Edgar M. Gamett. who escaped from
the Stockton Insane Asylum last Friday,
where he was sent for sending annoying
letters to Mrs. Walter Hobart and her sis
ter. Miss Juliet Williams, is safely locked
up in the insane ward at the Receiving
Hospital; and will be taken back to-day
to Stockton.
After Garnett made his escape he came
to this city and went to his father's house.
35 Essex "street. Deputy Keeper Austin
came on here after him and went to the
house. Garnett had barricaded himself in
his bedroom and threatened to kill him
self with a razor rather than be taken
back to the asylum. As the lunatic
mother was in poor health the deputy de
cided not to force an entrance to the
room, but to wait developments.
The police were notified, and Saturday
night Captain Spillane detailed Policeman
P. J. Tracey to watch the house, with in
structions if Garnett came out to follow
and arrest him. Tracev kept on watch
till after midnieht and then went home. _
Yesterday morning the young mans
father called upon Captain Spillane with
the information that Edgar had expressed
the intention of going to the Mercantile
Library to procure some reading tatter,
and the captain detailed Policeman A. T.
MrQuaide to watch for his appearance
and place him under arrest after he had
gone some distance from the house. Mc-
Quaide had only been a few minutes on
the lookout when Edgar came out of the
house. McQuaide quietly followed him
till he reached Second and Mission streets,
where he entered a store to purchase a
morning paper. â _ -i
McQuaide ai.-Â»o entered the store, and in
an instant had the handcuffs over Gar
nett'" wrists. Garnett made an attempt
to r<=-ach his vest pocket, but McQuaide
was too quick for him, and pulled a razor
out of the pocket. Then Garnett became
indignant and demanded the reason of
such "outrageous treatment." The officer
told him that he was Edgar M. Garnet:,
who had escaped from the Stockton asy
lum, and Garnett replied: "You have
made a mistake, sir: my name is Sm::n.
ar.d I am a mining man from Plumas
County." .. . ,
McQuaide said he would take chance*
on being right, and rang in for the patrol
wagon Garnett was taken to the insane
ward, and he insisted that Porter Ashe
or Jack Casserly be summoned. He kept
up the role of Smith of Plumas til! Cap
tain Spillane saw him. when he admitted
his identity. He said he would starve
himself to death in the asylum, and in the
next breath asked Superintendent Nolan
to bring him a meal at once. It wa* sus
pected that he wanted a knife to cut his
throat, and when he got the meal a knife
was not supplied. _ TT _':'--'",
Garnett is a graduate of Harvard uill
verslty. and his father is a well -known
asÂ«ayer The young man's uncle was
Majo*r Robert Seldon rnett who came
here in IM9. and was the designer of the
Â«>eal of California: The young man b hal
lucination is that he is Irresistible, to
women, married or single, and he pesters
them with his attentions.

THAT LICENSE TAX.
Berkeley Town Trustees Will Con
sider It This Evening.
BERKELEY, July 23.â Some interesting
developments are expected at the regular
meeting of the Board of Trustees, to be
held In the Town Hall to-morrow even
ing at S o'clock. The much talked of li
cense tax upon merchants and express
men which has been agitating the busi
ngs section of the community for the
past two weeks, is to be brought up for
consideration.
The Merchants' Association, organized
for the express purpose of fighting tne
measure, will present a petition, signed oy
a large number of the business men of the
city asking that the tax be abolished.
Attorney M. C. Chapman of Oakland, re
tained as the legal adviser of the associa
tion, is expected to speak in behalf of his
clients.
Should the board rescind the tax the
cases of the merchants arrested last week
for refusing to comply with its require
ments will doubtless be dismissed next
Thursday, when they come up for trial
in Judge Edgar's court.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 2-3.â Secretary
Alger has always felt a pride in the
success with which the War Department
met the tremendous problem thrust upon
it by the necessity with which it was
suddenly confronted during the war with
Spain of suddenly disposing of the thou
sands of Spanish prisoners captured in
Santiago province. The history of that
time has not been fully told and it re
mained for Secretary Alger to-day to sup
ply the need by the following bit of
reminiscence: .-â '-â â â "â¢ -
"On the night of July 9. 1898, the Presi
dent asked me what in my judgment we
should do with the Spanish prisoners of
Santiago after their capture. The matter
had received very much thought from the
President and myself, but no definite con
clusion had been reached. 1 then sug
-â¢-â ; to the President that Galveston,
Texas, would be the best place in the
United States where we could send them;
that it was away from the coast line
travel; a good harbor; that there would
be plenty of room for camping them, and
that its climate would be as nearly sim
ilar to that of Santiago as we could prob
ably select. ,
"This seemed to meet his approval, as
11 was only a question of time, of course
when their capture would be effected. I
went to my home, as nearly as I can re
member, about 2 o'clock in the morning,
and being too tired to sleep I lay awake
for a while/but finally dozed off. I woke
at daybreak and my first thought was
concerning the Spanish prisoners, and the
new idea came into my head, '\\ hy not
send them back to Spain?' This thought
80 deeply Impressed me that I formulated
my plan, and on the morning of July 10,
instead of going to the department direct,
1 went to the White House and laid the
new plan before the President, saying
that It would be an unprecedented pro
cedure and a most gracious act. that to
transport the prisoners to Galveston
would be half the distance; that we should
have to clothe, shelter, guard and feed
them there, and no doubt have to ship
them bach to Spain in the end. I also
stated that I believed that it would be a
great inducement to the Spaniards to sur
render, which General Shafter afterward
assured me was the effect. The President
readily approved the plan, and on the
same day 1 cabled General Shafter as
follows:
'â¢ 'War Department. July 10. 1898.
'â¢ 'General Shafter. Playa del Este, San
tiago. Cuba: â  Should the Spaniards sur
render unconditionally and wish to return
to Spain they will be sent back direct
at the expense of the United States Gov
ernment. R. A. ALGER,
" 'Secretary of War.
"Upon receiving this on the Uth of July
General Shafter sent the following com
munication to the commander-in-chief of
the Spanish forces:
'* -Headquarters of Fifth Army Corps,
Camp near Santiago de Cuba, July 11,
1898.â Sir: With the largely increased
forces which have come to me. and the
fact that I have your line of retreat .-â â¢
curely In mv hands, the time seems litting
that I should again demand of your Ex
cellency the surrender of Santiago and of
your Excellency's army. I am authoried
to state that should your Excellency so
desire, the Government of the United
States will transport the entire command
of your Excellency to Spain.
â â¢â l have the honor to De, very respect
fully, your obedient servant,
â¢"WILLIAM R. SHAFTER.
â¢â  'Major General commanding.'
"To which the commander replied:
" 'Santiago de Cuba. July 11, 1898.â Sir:
I have the honor to advise your Excellency
that your communication of this date is
received, and in reply desire to confirm
that which I said In my former communi
cation; also to advise you that 1 have
communicated your proposition to the
general-in-chief. Reiterating my senti
ments. 1 am, your respectful servant,
JOSE LORAL,
" 'Commander-in-chief Fourth Corps and
Military Governor of Santiago.'
"Immediately upon the surrender steps
were taken to carry out the pledges of
the United States Government shipment
of Spaniards home. The Quartermaster i
Department immediately advertised for
bids to transport the prisoners to Spain,
â with the result that eight of the ocean
transportation companies submitted a
combined bid, which was for officers ?H0
and for enlisted men $33 per capita,
steamers to be dispatched from Santiago
de Cuba within forty-eight hours of their
reported arrival, or demurrage to be paid
at the rate of 60 cents per capita pel day;
same demurrage to be paid If steamers
be detained at place of debarkation by
quarantine or other cause. The Spanish
Transatlantic Company's bid was fro per
capita for officers and 120 for enlisted
men, with no demurrage. The Spanish
company's offer was accepted, the rations
for the" prisoners were inspected by a
United States Government official, and
this Government paid for the transporta
tion of all the prisoners $613,860. The same
number carried by the other companies
under their hid would have cost the Gov
ernment $1,312,915. Here was (800,000 saved
to the United States and probably as
much more in demurrage.
;*SÂ«-rre days after the contract was
awarded the President said to me as I
entered the Cabinet room: 'Mr. Secre
tary, would you like to hear something
favorable to you printed in the New York
Times?' and went on to read the editorial
comment complimentary to the man
whose mind originated the plan of trans
porting the Spaniards back to Spain."

George Piggott was taken yesterday
morning to the Harbor Receiving Hospi
tal in an unconscious condition, as the re
sult of an overdose of morphine taken
with suicidal intent. After his stomach
had been sluiced out he regained con
sciousness and made the walls vibrate
with another echo of the recent French
ball.
Piggott is the husband of that Grace
Piggott who came into prominence in
March a year ago, at which time she and
another girl. Lena Carillo, attempted to
commit suicide by jumping into the bay
from the steamer Piedmont. Both girls
were rescued. Because Grace Piggott de
serted him George Piggott took morphine.
"Gracie and I went to the French ball
together," he told Dr. Rice, "and we bad
a splendid time of it until I was over
come and lost her. I haven't seen her
since then, and heard this morning that
she had given me up for good. That was
too much for me to stand, so I got my
friend, Tom Cassidy. to get me 10 cents'
worth of morphine, and I swallowed it all.
When I began to go to sleep they ran me
down here, and that's all I know. I don't
care if Gracie never comes back."
J. McCarty of 13% Harriet street was an
other caller at the hospital. He will know
better after this than to interfere with
two drunken sailors when th- " are fight
ing. He tried to separate the men. and
got his little finger badly bitten for his
pains.
E. Salinger was another victim who had
to go yesterday to the water front for as
sistance. He lives at 7 St. Charles place.
While carrying a lamp from one room to
another he slipped and fell. The lamp ex
ploded and burned him severely about the
wrists and hands. His left wrist was
sprained in the fall. Dr. Dorr fixed up
his wounds.
The battleship lowa arrived from Puget
Sound yesterday. She has been on the
Port Orchard drydock, and looks as spick
and span as the day she was launched.
She was thrown open to the public dur
ing the afternoon, and a big crowd went
aboard in Peterson's launches. The lowa
will take her ammunition and supplies
aboard at once, and will then go for a
cruise to Central America.
The transport Tartar will not get away
until this morning. She was to have gone
Saturday night; then she was to have
sailed yesterday morning: but the troops
who are to go on her had not arrived, so
her sailing date was again postponed. As
soon as she sails the transnort Indiana,
now coaling at Howard-street wharf, will
take her place. She will be got away for
Manila as quickly as possible.
READ THE GOSPEL
IN THE HEAVENS
...
"The Gospel in the Heavens" was the
j subject of Dr. Charles Edward Locke's
| sermon last night at the Central Metho
; dist Episcopal Church. Dr. I. eke gave as
j an illustration many of the marvelous
â¢ facts known to students of astronomy. In
I referring to the sun he said that if it were
j hollow there could be tumbled into it 352,
--000 globes like our earth: that it was SOO.
--000 times denser than its system, and
j hence was the center of gravity. He re
i ferred to the eight planets of the sun,
I and said that Neptune was the farthest
1 distant, 25,000,000 of miles. The fixed stars
were also described as suns, and as being
distant from the earth not less than 100,000
times 190,000,000 of miles. He said the â 
polar star was equal to eighty-six of our j
suns; that the milky way was composed
of suns, each of which had a planetary
system like our own sun. Having called
attention to these and many other astro- j
nomical truths. Dr. Locke said:
Does some one say this is not the gospel?
Ah! tell me where are there such illustrations
of the majesty and knowledge and power and
perfection of the Great Father? Truly "Great
and marvelous are thy works. Lord God Al
mighty.'' Every glistening orb in yonder
heavens is an eloquent preacher of righteous
ness, "day unto day uttering speech and night
showing knowledge." Who can remain ir
reverent or atheistic in such a presence?
ELOQUENT SERMON
BY BISHOP GAINES
Bishop \V. J. Games, D.D., of Atlanta. ;
Ga., preached the sermon last evening at!
Bethel African M. E. Church, taking for |
his text: "There shall come a star out of !
Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Is- j
rael." He said in part:
Jesus Christ came as a star in the moral
night of this world to banish the spiritual dark
ness which enveloped the minds and souls of
men. He was a star in the night or" sin. for
the world was black with sin when Christ came
out of Jacob. If you were asked to-day which
is the greatest kingdom In the world you would
answer that of Jesus Christ, who wields a
scepter that is mightier than any ever held by
mortal man. Be faithful to your King. Be
Christian by practice; live up to the holy tenets
of the church and God will give you rest.
After his sermon Bishop Games made
an earnest appeal to the congregation, j
among* whom were many white people, for j
assistance in lifting the debt of the i
church, amounting to $6500. He remarked
that white people had given $45,000,000 to
the cause of religion and education in the
South, and he himself had raised $500,000
during his ministerial career. Bishop
Games will preach this morning at 11 i
o'clock in the Young Men's Christian As
sociation auditorium.
REV. FATHER WOODS
ON THE VIRTUE OF HOPE
Rev. Father Woods delivered the sev
enth Of his series of discourses prepara
tory to the consecration of the twentieth
century to Christ at St. Ignatius Church
last night. He took for his theme "Th*
Virtue of Hope in the Promises of God,"
and he said in part:
Men are prone to place small hope in the
promises of God. but we should rely on his |
keeping them without fall. Men and women I
of the world set very little score on what
Christ in his infinite generosity has agreed to j
do. He has premised us heaven, and If we
seek his grace we shall surely attain it. There j
is no prospect whatever for the world If we '<
renounce supernatural revelation, for It looks
as if the devil in that case would triumph and
that God is losing. It is important that we !
should avoid evil and do good, In order to
prepare ourselves to consecrate the approach- ;
ing century to the Lord Jesus Christ. Let us
by a devotion to the Sacred Heart instill in \
ourselves a spirit of hope. Let us believe in I
the supernatural virtue of hope and rest as- ;
sured that God will accomplish everything !
he has promised us for our salvation. Let
us co-operate with Christ in order, that his
glory may be proclaimed throughout the world. '
REV. WILLIAM RADER
SCORES SPIRITUALISM
Rev. William Rader discussed the sub
ject of "Spiritualism" at the Third Con
gregational Church last evening. He said
among other things:
There is a distinct revival of spiritualism at
the present time in the United States. It dates
back to IMS, when the Fox sisters discovered
a eposslble communication with the departed
through a system of "rapping*. " One who
was Identified with the Fox sisters has just
published an article In which a confession la
made of their fraudulent methods. To-day our
cities are filled with trance mediums and clair
voyants, who for a "consideration" connect
you with eternity. Hypnotism. mesmerism,
telepathy, palmistry increase the enthusiasm
in the mysteries of spirit intercourse. The
rapid spread of this cult is due to- extreme
materialism. Spiritualism has been summoned
to the bar of science and has been found want
ing. I believe that spiritualism produces an
unhealthy mental and spiritual condition, The r Â»
is no short cut to eternity and nobody has a
private telephone to the dead. Spiritualism
has brought nothing back from the other world
worth learning. Xo problem has been solved,
no sorrow assuaged. I know of no spiritualist
who Is an active Christian church worker.
A SERMON BY
AN EVANGELIST
Evangelist H. A. Ironside preached last
night in the hall on City Hall square, tak
ing his text from Jude, eleventh verse:
"Woe unto them, for they have gone in
the way of Cain, and ran greedily after
the error of Balaam for reward, and per
ished in the gainsaying of Core." He said:
said: .
There are three classes represented her- 1 In
Cain we have the man who In the matter of
salvation deliberately set aside the blood of
Christ and thinks to approach God In a way â -'
his own. relying on the works of his own
hands. Some centuries ago the church set out
to convert the world, but it ended by the world
ail but converting the church.

BRIG HARRIET G IS LOADING
FOR NEW BRITAIN.
â â
Mate of the Topgallant Minus Legs
From the Knees Down Goes
Aloft Like the Best
Sailor Afloat.
There was a remarkable coincidence
yesterday on the water front. Three ves
sels that came here from the East with
gold hunters during the rush to the Klon
dike were all heard from at once, the
i ewe from one bringing up the other two
and Incidentally the whole fleet.
The schooner Rube L. Richardson, that
arrived here from Boston August 1. 1898,
was the first to be heard from. After
Ing provisioned here she sailed for
trrrection Bay with her crew of gold
hunters, but misfortune followed both
crew and vessel. The crew found no gold
and the vessel Is buried under tons of
sand in Cooks Inlet. During the storms
of last winter she was driven on a bar,
and succeeding gales piled the sand
around and over her until now nothing
but her masts can be seen. The news that
came from Cooks Inlet yesterday Is to
the effect that she is practically burieu,
and the schooner that cost the gold hunt
ers (10,000 in Boston was sold to a Cap
tain Newport for $100.
The number 13 played a very im
portant part ln the affairs of the Rube L.
Richardson and her crew. On August 2,
1898, The Call, in Its account of the ar
rival of the schooner, said:
That unlucky number 13â it had no terrors
for the members of the Commonwealth Mining
Company of Boston. It incorporated on the
13th, bought a schooner 13 years old, started for
the Klondike on the 13th of the month. During
the voyage they killed 13 albatross, caught 13
bonita, but the thirteenth member of the party
never reached San Francisco. Nine days .cut
from BOeton he was washed overboard during
_ sale and his companions could do nothing
toward paving him. One moment they saw him
on the crest of a wave and the next he was
gone. Still they are full of hope and every
man of them expects to make a fortune in the
frozen north.
Whether the number 13 has still
no terrors for them is hard to say, as
there are none of them here to answer.
Some are dead, some are still chasing that
will o" the wisp, fortune, arid all of the
living are broke.
The brig Harriet G also came here with
gold hunters, but her passengers scat
tered soon after the vessel anchored off i
Meiggs wharf. Since then the vessel has'
been in the coasting trade. Now. how- 1
ever, she is loading at Hathaways wharf
for New Britain direct; the first vessel
that has ever cleared from San Fran
cisco for that island. Neu Pommeru. or
New Britain, is part of the German New
Guinea possessions, and is very sparsely
settled. A German trading station is to
be established there and the Harriet G is
taking down the lumber and supplies for
the place. She came here from Grays
Harbor and discharged last week 40.000
feet of lumber. A good deal of this was
taken out of the hold, and in the vacant
space .dl the merchandise will be stowed. !
Ihe hatches will then be battened down |
and a deckload of lumber taken aboard.
From New Britain the Harriet d will go !
to Australia and there load coal for Sen
Francisco.
From the Harriet <; it is only a step to
the California drydock, and there the
bark Topgallant is being sheathed and
painted, The vessel is in charge of the
mate, as Captain Hans .1. Lunwaldt Is
away on his honeymoon. Last Wednesday
Captain Hans asked for a holiday and
without saying a word to his host of
friends on the water front quietly slipped
away and got married to Miss Louise
Gelmini.
The mate of the- Topgallant is the man
that completes the trio of gold hunters,
and not Captain Lundwaldt. Mate Nich
olson came hero as chief officer of the
schooner Mildred E. She also came from
Boston and carried a party of gold hunt
ers. After arriving here on September 1,
IS9S, the party broke up and some of them
went to the Klondike via Puget Sound
and some- via St. Michael. The majority
of them are now back in Boston, poorer
than they were a year ago, but the mate
is still lure.
Nicholson Is th.- most remarkable man j
that ever went before the mast to earn
a living. Both his legs are gone from a .
little below the knees, and yet he can
climb the mast and take a reef In a sail
with the best sailor afloat. He is a first
class navigator, and a better seaman
never trod the quarter deck. He has cork
legs and feet, and. although he walks a
little stiff, no one would ever know if not
told that there was anything the matter.
When a lad of 12 Nicholson was caught !
in a disaster that resulted in the amputa
tion of both limbs below the knees. He i
had been brought up on the sea and did
not know where to earn a living if not
on shipboard. The captain of the schooner
William Park took him with him as cabin
boy, and during his spare moments taught
him navigation. As he got older the boy
went before the mast and soon could take j
his trie i: a- the wheel and go aloft with |
the best of them. When the Mildred E I
was fitted out to bring gold hunters to
California the party wanted a navigator,
and Nicholson was engaged. Some terrible
weather was encountered during the voy
age, but th.- schooner pulled through, and,
finally, after .â . passage of 175 days from
Boston, San Francisco was reached.
The Topgallant on the drydock towers
away up into the air, and it takes three
â adders spliced together to reach from the
Boor of the dock to the vessel's bulwarks.
Yet the mate with his wooden legs went
up these swaying ladders as quickly as
a man with sound limbs could walk the
same distance on lev* l ground.
GRAND OPERA SEASON.
It Begins at the Tivoli a Week From
To-Night..
A number of famous opera singers from
Europe and the East arrived in the city
last evening from New Stork; and they,
with many others, are to make their ap
pearance at the Tlvoll opera-house next
Monday evening, when the grand opera
season of the theater will begin. Among
those who arrived is Fraulein Ella Pros

part of the famous tenor, Campaninl. Miss
Mary Linck, who was heard here last sea

fork, where she ha; been singing with
the greatest success. Anna Lichter, whose
beautiful voice was tlrst heard at the
Tivoli in grand opera, has been re- i
engaged, and William Mertens. an Amer
ican barytone, who went to Germany three
years ago. is another addition to the Tlv
oli's forces. >. ;
Every one will remember the furor re
cently "created at the- California Theater
by tin- tenor. Signor Avedano, and the
barytone, Signor Salassa, when they ap
peared with an opera company from Mex
ico. These two great artists have been
under contract with the Tivoli for the
(last two months to sins during the grand

was here, has also been secured by the
Tlvoll. and the rest of the principals,
chorus and orchestra will be In keeping
with tin list of names mentioned.
The opening bill is to be "Alda," and the
management promises that the season of

him down. Smith was stunned by the
blow, and when he recovered his senses
the man had disappeared, having taken
the soapmaker's gold watch and chain
and about $'.) with him.
There was no one to be- seen on the
street, and Smith, after picking himself
up, started out to find a policeman. As
soon as he met one on Sixth street he re
ported the robbery to him and the facta
were communicated to police headquar
ters.
Smith was able to give a good descrip
tion of the robber. As the soapmaker is
a powerfully built man, surprise was ex
pressed that he was so easily made a
victim of the robber, who was a much
more slightly built man. He said he
could easily have overpowered the fel
low, but he did not get a chance, as the
blow on the Jaw knocked him out for a
few minutes.
Two detectives were detailed on the case
and after making an investigation they
discovered that the robber had visited
seme- of the saloons in the neighborhood
after the robbery and had spent a good
portion of the $9 taken from Smith. The
detectives believe that they will have no
difficulty in arresting him as soon as he
gels over the debauch with the money
stolen from Smith.
A bad crowd of hoolums hangs around
the neighborhood of Langton and Bryant
streets, and the robber Is supposed to lie
one of the gang. ; ; I
MANILA-BOUND
SOLDIERS IN A
RAILROAD WRECK
The Nineteenth United States Infantry
1 arrived yesterday from the East. The
I regiment came in in detachments and as
each marched off the ferry it was led
| down to the Government dock and was
, sent at once on board the transport Tar
tar, which will take the regiment to
| Manila.
The regiment arrived in good condition
| and, until it reached Suisun, without mis
i hap. At Teal station, however, just this
j side of Suisun, an- accident which might
j have been a most serious one delayed the
train with six or seven others for several
hours. The troops' train was ordered on
to a siding to allow one .of the regular
trains to pass. All the cars were safely
run over the switch except the last one.
The rear trucks of that jumped the
j switch and kept on down the main line,
: and the result was a smash-up that
I blocked the road and shook the soldiers
from their seats.
The accident occurred at 2 o'clock yes-
I terday morning. It was found impossible
! either to clear the main line or the
switch, so travel was blocked until the
tangle could be straightened out. The
: troops were on two trains and both of
these were held until 1 o'clock yesterday
afternoon, when the line was opened. By
! that time two or three passengers and as
many more freight trains were waiting.
The regiment, which is under command
I of Colonel Snider, was sent from Pen.n
--; SylvaniaV It was- intended to send the
transport away on the L'L'd Inst., but delay
l in getting the regiment on the road and
across the continent has held the vessel.
She will sail to-day or to-morrow.
Except for the Sunday crowds the Pre-
I sidio was a quiet place yesterday. There
! were no parades nor ceremonies in the
Oregon camp, and so the men had plenty
of time, to entertain the throngs of visit
ors that blocked the company streets from
early in the forenoon until retreat. This
evening at 5:30 a dress parade and review
will be tendered to Mayor Phelan. It will
be one similar to that tendered General
Beebe last Friday evening, only according
to General Summers' promise, it will be
better. . . . . "
To-morrow is the time set for the turn
ing in of all ordnance belonging to the !
regiment. This includes rifles and their
equipment and any ammunition the regi
ment may have on hand. There may De
some arrangement made with the Govern
ment to issue the arms again on memo
randum receipts, in order to have the reg
: iment go home under arms, but that is a
matter for future decision.
The comrades of Sergeant Allen Befort,
I Battery N. Third Artillery, becoming en
i thusiastic over tne appointment of Befort
I as a second lieutenant of volunteers, pre
sented him with a : beautiful sword last
j Saturday just after guard mount. .The
| battery Is stationed at Angel Island. The
presentation address was made by Cap
tain Hartlett. commanding Battery N. He
; spoke in- the highest terms of the lieuten
ant's fitness for his new position, and j
I expressed the esteem in which both offi- j
\ cers and men of the battery held him.
! Lieutenant Befort responded to the kind
; wishes oft* his comrades and then bade !
farewell to his old friends. He left the
: same day for his new station at Vancou- I
ver barracks.
Lieutenant Lefort was anointed a sec
j ond lieutenant of the Thirty-fifth Infantry |
in July. 1899. His career in the army com- I
'< menced in the Fourth Artillery, in which
jhe served for -.ree years. He was dis
, charged with the rank of sergeant, and !
was given an excellent character. He re- |
enlisted, this time in Battery N of the i
Third Artillery, just after the passage of
the army reorganization bill. He was
given his old rank of sergeant at. once,
and this he held until his appointment as
a lieutenant. Lefort was given his com
mission without an examination.

A BANG-UP FIGHTER.
Martin Dunphy of Kentucky Gets the
Worst of a Scrap With Three
-;\,-':/ Other Soldiers.
Martin Dunphy. a soldier, who has been
assigned to . the ' Seventeenth Infantry, is
a "bang-up fighter," according to his own
statement, and he declares that in "old
Kentucky," where he was born and
reared, he could lick any old man.
Yesterday" morning Dunphy was brought
to the Receiving Hospital in the patrol
wagon by Policeman P. Coleman from
Webster and Greenwich streets. His face
was covered with blood and his eyes were
blackened. He was so drunk that he could
not tell his name, but Steward Muller
thought it sounded like "Bill Cohen,"
and so it was registered. Dr. Stephen had
to put several stitches in a knife wound
over Dunphy's right eye and another
over his left eye.
Dunphy explained his condition by say
ing that he got Into a fight with three
other soldiers at Webster and Greenwich
streets- and they were too many for him.

BOY'S FEARFUL
FALL NEAR THE
CLIFF HORSE
Walter Herkenham Is
Dying.
â â
HE SLIPPED FROM THE ROCKS
â â¦ â
SKULL FRACTURED AND HEAD
BADLY CUT.
â¦
Was Allowed to Lie at tho Park Hos
pital for Two Hours When an
Immediate Operation Was
Imperative.
Walter Herkenham, the twelve-year-olu
son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Herkenham
of 909 Alice street, Oakland, fell yester
day afternoon a distance of thirty feet
from the rocks near the Cliff "House, re
ceiving serious but not necessarily fatal
injuries.
It is possible, however, that the delay
in dressing the boy's wounds, caused
through lack of necessary accommoda
tions at the Park Hospital, may result in
his death.
In the recklessness of youth young
Herkenham began the ascent of the rag
ged promontory that juts into the ocean
just below the Cliff House shortly after
4 o'clock in the afternoon, lie had as
cended thirty feet when his playmates,
standing below on the. beach, heard him
scream. Booking up, they were transfixed
with horror when they saw that he had
j lost his hold upon the crags and was
slipping towards the rocks below. They
shouted for help, but an instant later tne
body of the boy shot downward. He lay
| on the rocks while half a hundred people
: who witnessed his fall hurried to his aid.
His unconscious and bleeding body was
| picked up and carried to the Seal Rock
1 House, word being immediately sent to
the Park Emergency Hospital. The am
! bulance hurried out and in an hour he
| was in the hospital.
Dr. Nlemeyer made an examination of
the boy's hurts and found that he was
bleeding profusely from a ragged wound
in the head and also that he had in all
probability suffered a fracture of the oc
cipital bone on the left side. Although
it was tlie opinion of the physician tnat
an operation should be performed immedi
ately in order to save the patient's life,
a lack of facilities prevented.
For some unaccountable reason tne
Board of Health has never seen tit to put
a ward in at the headquarters of the Park
Hospital. There are only sufficient instru
ments at the institution with which to
successfully remove a splinter or dress a
bumped head. A capital operation is im
possible. For this reason no operation
i could be performed on Herkenhan at the
j Park Hospital, and after the hemorrhage
I had been controlled, a matter occupying
some lime, a bandage was placed around
! the hoy's head and he was removed to the
Receiving Hospital.
Charlie Herkenham. the injured hoy's
1 brother, and Grove and Wallace O'Connor
accompanied the ambulance to the Re-
I ceiving Hospital. As soon as they saw
; the still unconscious youth placed in bed
they hurried to Ids home and apprised his
! parents of the accident.
In the meantime preparations had been
made at the Receiving Hospital to operate
on the injured lad. The parents arrived
at the hospital before the operation com
menced, however, and had him removed
ito the Lane Hospital. There he will re
. main until such time as returning health
! will permit of his removal to his home or
until death relieves his sufferings.
MISSING GIRLS FOUND.
Beatrice and Jennie Jorgensen Have
Been Located at Stockton.
Beatrice and Jennie Jorgensen. sisters,
aged 18 and 16 years, respectively, who
disappeared from their home at 141$
O'Farrell street June 21 last, have been
located in Stockton. Chief of Police Gall
of that city found them yesterday and
reports that they are content to remain
where they are.
The girls left their home on the after
noon of June 21, telling their mother they
were going to call on a friend living on
Geary street and that they would be gone
not longer than an hour. Their mother
has not seen them since. It has been
learned since that the girls were at the
Chutes on the evening of their disappear
ance and were making merry and evident
ly having the best of good times. After
that evening nothing more was heard of
them until Chief Gall located them in
Stockton.
Mrs. Cecelia Jorgensen, the mother, has
been nearly prostrated by worry since
their disappearance.
MOTHER MACDERMOT
PASSES AWAY IN INDIA
ONCE SUPERIOR OF SACRED
HEART CONVENT.
Tidings From the Far East of the
Death of a Devoted Worker in
the Catholic Church.
Tidings of the death of Sister Mary
Ignatius MacDermot. formerly mother su
perior of the Sacred Heart Presentation
Convent, have been received from India.
Her death, which terminated a life ' of
zealous devotion to the church, occurred
June 13, after an illness of ten days.
Mother MacDermot took the veil in 1576,
entering the Sacred Heart Presentation
Convent in this city. In 1884 she was
elected mother superior. She directed tho
work of the convent for about five years,
having in -~- for Ireland.
A visit of a few months was terminated
by her acceptance of a call from India.
In company with three other sisters she
left to aid "in the missionary work at the
Convent of Veprey, near Madras. There
she remained two years, when, by her ac
tivity and devotion, she founded a con
vent at Rawul Pindee. in the Punjab, in
the extreme northwest of Hindoostan.
This zealous sister established there an
orphanage for natives and a day school
for native and white children.
CLIMBED MOUNT TAMALPAIS.
Postofflce Outing Club Enjoyed a
Novel Early Morning Picnic.
I .The members of the recently organized
| Postofflce Outing Club climbed to the
i summit of Mount Tamalpais before dawn
I yesterday morning, and were well repaid
for the exertion of the long tramp by a
glorious view of the rising sun. The mail
handlers, accompanied by their wives, sis
ters and sweethearts, left San Francisco
Saturday night on the theater boat for
Sausalito. From that place they went by
train to Ross Station, where they arrived
very early Sunday morning. Then com
menced tin- mountain climbing. There
| were a number of musicians in the party,
and under the inspiring influence of music
the summit was reached at 4 a. m., he
fore any one thought of being tired and
just as old Sol was making his appear
ance above the distant horizon. After
enjoying a light luncheon and a few
hours' rest the party descended the trail
to Mill Valley, where they boarded the
train for the city. The duty's next outing
will be held in about two "weeks, and a
cordial invitation is extended to all civil
service employes. - -' v
The officers of the club are: Captain, J.

rian and scientist, C. Wise O'Brien; scout,

Before leaving the summit Captain
Spilier released two carrier pigeons, and
the birds arrived at their cotes on Union
street just forty minutes later.

TAX LEVY WILL
BE DISCUSSED
BY SUPERVISORS
To Listen to Pleas of
City Officials.
At 4 o'clock this afternoon the heads of
departments at the City Hall will go be
fore the Board of Supervisors to clamor
for cash. The Fire Department, the
County Clerk, the Assessor and all the
rest of those who have spent the past two
weeks in pleading for a raise in their
apportionment under the tax levy, have
been notified that the board has granted
them a rehearing, and that a half-hour of
to-day's meeting has been set aside for
them.
The Finance Committee has as yet done
j nothing toward fixing the permanent tax
levy, nor will it until Mayor Phelan makes
good his promise to meet with it and
point out just how- to satisfy everybody
and keep within the "dollar limit." Be
fore leaving on his late vacation the
Mayor announced that he would meet
with the committee on one day last week,
but instead he went to Santa Cruz to at
tend the encampment of the League of he
Cross Cadets, and since his return has
been dumb on all matters pertaining to
the paramount question.
Because of the uncertainty incident to
the delay business at the hall is becoming
sadly demoralized. County Clerk Deane
does not know whether he is going to
have $6000 or $10,000 per month with which
to run his office., and has already dis
charged a number of his force because- he
is afraid he is going to be held down to
the lesser amount. Assessor Dodge is not
sure whether he will get 136,000 or $70,000.
and he has a little list of those who are
to get the ax in case he is handed the
short figure. The rest are in the same un
certain state of mind, while panic reigns
among the deputies. . -
Because of his dilatory tactics in hand
ling the matter Mayor Phelan is coming
in for considerable censure. His absence
at Santa Cruz last week prevented the
regular meeting of the Finance Commit
tee, and there will be no report from that
body to-day. That there will not be is
likely to give rise to some unpleasant
questions on the part of several members,
and the Mayor may be called upon to
say when he will have time to meet with
the committee and illuminate the path
that will prevent the board from straying
outside the "dollar limit." Not much time
is left, and absolutely nothing has been
done on the budget.

has arranged for the removal of its ashes
and garbage by means of automobiles.
