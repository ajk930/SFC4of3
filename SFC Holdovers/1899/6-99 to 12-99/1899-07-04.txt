PREPARES TO SAIL
TO COME HOME ON THE SHERMAN.
Transport Sherman Leaving Negros Island With the First California
Regiment on Board-
MANILA, July 3. â Reports have been received here of an outbreak in the island of Xegros
incident upon the departure of . the California Regiment for home. Some hostile
natives, seeing a company of soldiers at one of the small posts preparing to de
part, thought the Americans were evacuating the island and a party of 250 rebels, mostly bolo
men, attacked the troops and killed one man and wounded another belonging to Company Â£. The
} : ilipinos were easily driven off.
The transport Sherman will bring the California troops to Manila before starting for San
Francisco. The transport Grant will soon embark the Colorado Regiment.
MANILA. July General Law- J
ton, who, with Colonel Denby
and Professor Worcester of the
American Philippine Commis
sion, has been visiting Las
Plnas for the purpose of establishing
civil government as the beginning of
a similar system in all the captured
cities In Cavite Province, has returned
to Manila. He Is greatly pleased with
the success of his visit. He established |
civil government at Las Pinas, in- i
stalling: natives in various offices and
establishing censorship over the local
press. The outlook, he says, is very I
promising.
The greatest preparations have been
made for the celebration of the Fourth j
in Manila to-morrow. There will be a !
parade of the school children, headed j
by the bands of the American regi- j
ments and local bands, and speeches at |
the Soldiers* Institute, at which Colonel
Denby will preside. In the evening
there will be fireworks on the Luneta.
All the batteries will join in firing a
Ealute at noon.
Professor J. G. Schurman, president
of the Philippine Commission, who
went some time ago on the gunboat
P><=nnington to visit the outer islands,
has returned from his trip. He ex
presses himself much pleased by the
Americanization of the southern is
lands, especially Xegros, where com
plete civil government Is in operation. !
During the trip he visited British
North Borneo, where he studied the >
English system of administration.
Presin>rt Schurman spent a day at
Iloilo and made a visit at Molo. He
found everything quiet there. A thou
sand Tagals in the northern part of the
Islands comprise the only troublesome
element in Panay. From Iloilo Pro- 1
fessor Schurman -proceeded to Negron j
Island. whTP he was specially inter- ;
ested in studying the conditions be
cause the Inhabitants of that Island
have always been friendly to the
Americans. In an interview he said:
"I found the situation in Negros |
pleasing. . The people are arranging a ;
local constitution, which was submitted ,
to me. I advised some changes, princi
pally regarding the Judiciary. It had j
been proposed to elect native judges for i
three and four year terms. I suggested |
the necessity of having Americans fill
these positions on the ground that for
eign nations might otherwise demand
consular Jurisdiction. The native offi
cials agreed to my suggestion, and said
It would be a better plan to have Amer- J
ican judges, because Americans were
not likely to be prejudiced from local
causes.
"The constitution proposed a native
Governor. I suggested that this office,
too, be filled by -an American. The
Negrosites admitted in the abstract
that this would be the better plan. The :
constitution had, however, already been '
drafted and the people expected to have
a native Governor. I then suggested
that the Governor should have an
American adviser, and to this the na
tives agreed."
Professor Schurman thinks there will i
be little difficulty in the island of Cebu. |
In Bohol all that is needed is simply
force to protect the towns.
Schurman said: "Cebu and Bohol are â 
ready for American occupancy when- |
ever we choose to send forces there. i
The natives will not oppose us. Samar :
and Leyte are more infected with the
Tagal spirit of rebellion, because they
are nearer Luzon. They present slight
ly more difficult questions to settle. The
insurgent, Luchan, who is In command j
there, Ib fomenting trouble.
"The question in the Visayas Is politi- :
cal instead of military. Whenever j
Aguinaldo is crushed the Visayans will i
submit passively. They are awaiting a j
settlement of the trouble in the island !
of Luzon and are willing to abide- the
result. They have no desire to fight.
Even in Panay there will be no fight-
Ing."
From the Visayas Professor Schur
man went to Puerta Caldera and to
Zamboanga, Of his visit to Mindano j
The San Francisco Call.
Professor Pchurman said: "There are
500,000 inhabitants, one-third Christian,
one-third pagans and one-third Moros.
Here the question is diplomatic. The
Moro chief in Zamboanga province is
friendly to the Americans and has
raised the American flag. The chief of
Basilan is also friendly and is prepar
ing to follow his example. The Chris
tians dislike the Tagals, and naturally
are not amenable to their influence.
They will probably follow the Visay
ans. They await only tactful dtfpfo
macy on the part of the Americans.
The pagans were reached through
their chitfs. In dealing with them it
is again a question of diplomacy."
The next place visited was Jolo. Pro
fpcc,,r Schurman says this is a beauti
ful island with a delightful climate and
splendid resources awaiting American
development. Schurman will sail for
home on "Wednesday.

OTIS.
The department sums up the situa
tion as outlined by General Otis in the
following statement: To meet the re
quirements of the returning volunteers
the Quartermaster's Department re
ports there are now in Manila the
transports Sherman, Warren and
Grant, with a capacity of 199 officers
and 4924 enlisted men. There are now
at sea en route to Manila the Zealandia
(due July 20), Sheridan (due July 21),
Valencia (due July 26) and Pennsyl
vania (due July 29), with capacity for
161 officers and 4200 enlisted men. There
are now in San Francisco the trans
ports City of Para, which will sail July
12, and Tartar, to sail July 20, with a
capacity for fifty-five officers an' 1 â¢ 2300
enlisted men. There are now en joute
to San Francisco the following ti ana
ports, with capacity for 20!) officers ana
4664 enlisted men: Ohio, Newport, In
diana, Hancock, Senator, Morgan City
and Relief (hospital).
The department confidently, believes
the transportation has been so well ar
ranged by the Quartermaster's Depart
ment that the last of the volunteers
will leave Manila not later than the
10th of September, and it is expected
they will all be away by the Ist.
The recruits required for the regular
regiments in the Philippines are esti
mated at 6338 men.
The number of recruits now at sea
is 1507; number of recruits now at
San Francisco is 3284, a total of 4791,
leaving 1547 yet to be provided for.
The large number of vacancies . ex
isting in the Fourteenth, Eighteenth |
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, JULY 4, 1899.
and Twenty-third Infantry Is due to
the fact that these regiments went with
General Merritt's original expedition to
the Philippines and were not filled to
the maximum, also that the men in
these regiments who enlisted for the
war nre just now being discharged:
the men enlisting for the war in tho
other regiments were discharged be
fore the regiments left this country,
and the vacancies are due to the in
crease of the companies from 106 to 121?
men.
At the ratÂ» of enlistments for the last
few weeks the entire number will be
enlisted by the close of the 'present
week.
ELEVEN REGIMENTS OF
VOLUNTEERS FOH MANILA
WASHINGTON, July 3.â Official an
nouncement was made to-day of the in
tention of the President to raise
eleven regiments of volunteers,
besides filling all vacancies in
the regular regiments now at Man
ila. Two of the volunteer regiments
have been organized at Manila, and of
the remaining nine two will rendezvous
and be drilled at <'amp Meade, Pa.,
and one each at Plattsburg barracks,
N. V. ; Columbus barracks; Fort
Thomas, Kentucky; Fort Sheridan, Il
linois; Leavenworth, Kans. ; San An
tonio, Tex., and Vancouver barracks.
Regular army officers who commanded
volunteer regiments in the war with
Spain will be assigned to command the
nine new regiments, and will" proceed
immediately with their captains to
posts at which their respective regi
ments will be recruited and take meas
ures to enlist men in all parts of the
country without reference to regular
recruiting stations. By this means the
War Department expects that by Au
guest all the men needed to form the
regiments will have been obtained and
that by th<> following month they will
be In shape to sail for their destina
tion. The total number of volunteers
to be enlisted will be 13,781â11,781 for
the nine regiments to be organized In
this country, and 2000 in Manila. Each
regiment will have fifty officers, so that
the regimental strength will be 1359
men. The order for the enlistment of
volunteers will not be issued until next
week, the department having deter
mined to continue enlistments for the
regular service for another week. In
which time the entire number of 6338
men required to fill the regular regi
ments in Manila will be secured. Be-
lieving that the country does not want
politics to enter into army appoint
ments, the President proposes to select
men to be commissioned from the regu
lar service and those volunteers who
served creditably during the war with
Spain, and but one additional brigadier
general will be appointed.
PEACE TREATY RATIFIED
BY THE SPANISH SENATE
MADRID, July 3.â The Spanish Senate
resumed to-day the discussion of peace
between the kingdom of Spain and the
United States.

over Cuba in order that the island
should become independent and not an
nexed to the United States.

PECULIAR
TACTICS OF
THE CZAR
Refuses to Receive Foreign- i
ers Who Intercede in
Behalf of Finlanders.
DEPUTATMSMBBED
While Russia Fathers the Peace
Conference It Will Not Do an
Act of Justice.
Special Dispatch to Thm Call.
While the Czar is seeking at The
Hague to pose as the apostle of
peace he still stands at St. Peters
burg as the autocrat whom no power
can turn from his purpose to deprive
the Finns of their liberties. Not
even the most eminent man in Europe
will be heard when they appear to
plead the cause of these downtrodden
people, and petitions on behalf of
Finland from foreign nations are re
sented by Nicholas as impertinent.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 3.â The
presence here of a foreign deputa
tion to intercede in behalf of Fin
landers created a sensation of as-
tonishment. The deputation con- |
sists of six members. ex-Minister Tra
rieux of France, Professor Nordenskiold
of Sweden, Professor Brusa of Italy. '
Professor Van derVlugt of Holland, Dr.
Bogger of Norway and Dr. Hansen of ,
Denmark. They brought separate ad- ,
dresses from twelve European coun
tries, entreating the Ciar to heed the j
rejected petition at the Finns. Several
addresses refer to his Majestj''s aim for
universal peace and harmony. The j
Dutch address is dated "The year of the i
Peace Conference at The Hague."
The Russians profess to he highly of
fended at the attempt at foreign inter
ference, and foreign Embassadors are
hardly less indignant that the Czar was
not approached through them.
The Minister of the Imperial House
hold, after taking twenty-four hours to
recover from his surprise, referred the
delegates to the Minister' of the Inte
rior, who sent them to the Czar's adju
tant general. The .latter snit them
back ' to the Minister of the Interior,
who entertained them at ; luncheon, and
politely and delicately informed them
his Majesty did not " wish to receive
them.
All the officials seemed fearful of
wounding their susceptibility. It is be
lieved M. PobiedoneÃtzeff, Procurator
of the Holy Synod, was mainly an*
swerable for the rejection of the ad
dresses. The delegates will return via
Helsingfors, where they will deposit the
addresses in the Finnish archives.
NEW YORK, July 3.â Journal spe
cial from Berlin says: Advices received
from St. Petersburg state that Grand
j Duke Vladimir's official tour of Finland
I has not been a triumphant success.
The Grand Duke, after a six days' trip,
| reports to his nephew, the Czar, that
Governor Bohrikoff's optimistic state
| ments that the people are accepting the
i alteration of the old constitution are
I utterly incorrect. Everywhere he goes,
the Grand Duke asserts, he has been
! met with coldness, and at a banquet at
I one town only six local officials could
i be Indued to dine with him. Grand
Duke Vladimir recommends to the Czar
that the old constitution be maintained.
THE HAGUE. July The drafting
committee of the arbitration commit
tee of the peace conference passed the
second reading of Sir Julian Paunce
fote's scheme for a permanent court of
arbitration to-day, and . then took up
the Russians' scheme, which is now
entitled "The Law of Arbitration and
Disputes Thereunder."
Sir Julian Pauncefote's scheme was
amended so as to permit the powers
wishing to take advantage of it to pro- j
pose four names for judges, and also
to permit the foreign powers at The
Hague to replace the permanent coun
cil of administration suggested In the
proposal of the heads of the British
delegation.
At the suggestion of M. Leon Bour
geois, the head of the French delega
tion, the drafting committee decided
that, in the event of a dispute, it should
be the duty of neutral powers to call
the attention of the disputant nations
to the existence of the permanent court
of arbitration. â¢ 'â¢
TURBINE SYSTEM OF
ENGINES FOR THE VIPER
Innovation in the Construction of a
British Torpedo Boat
Destroyer.
NEW YORK, July 3. â A Sun cable from
London says: Keen interest is felt at the
admiralty In the development of the tor
pedo-boat destroyer Viper, which will be
launched shortly on the Tyne. The
Messrs. Parsons are fitting her with the
turbine system of engines, and they be
lieve they will enable her to make forty
five miles an hour. Experiments are be

turbine system aboard ocean steamers.
Kxpr rts are of the opinion that this sys
tem will revolutionize ocean travel and
make it possible to cross the Atlantic in
three days.
CUBED OF LEPROSY.
Wonderful Recovery of a Negro Who
Had the Disease.
NEW YORK, July 3.â The World says:
Philip Sydney, a negro, who was one of
the Jeper inhabitants of the North Broth

to-day apparently entirely cured of lep
rosy. Drs. W. S. Stone and A. H. Man
dell examined him.
To-morrow Sidney will go to Black
well's Island to carry the good news to
two of his former leper companions, a
Chinaman and a German, who are at the
Almshouse.
The descriptions Sidney gave of the
wonderful remedy that cured him are
vague. The doctors understand him to
say that it came from India. Dr. Stone
said: "There Is no doubt but that Sidney
had leprosy. His cure ia wonderful."

THREE BODIES LIE
BENEATH THE RUINS
CHICAGO, July 3.â Three persons are
believed to be dead beneath the tottering
walls of the Western Paper Stock Com
pany's plant, which was burned to-day.
The dead:
BARTHOLOMEW SPARKOETETZ, 50
years old.
MRS. JO.SIE DOYLE. 21 years old.
STEFFANIE BAGDCIES.
Th.c fire is thought to have started from
spontaneous eombustfon among some old
rat?? In the basement. The building stood
at 1452-1458 Indiana avenue and mi a
four-story brick structure. The flames
quickly spread to the upper floors by way
of the elevator shaft and stairway. The
highly Inflammable nature of the stock
caused the building to fill with dense
smoke, rendering escape difficult for em
ployes on the three higher- stories. The
occupants of the building became panic
stricken and rushed to the windows.
Those who went to the front, where
there was a fire escape, were able to
escape On the south side of the burned
structure, however, many of the frenzied
women leaped out of the third-story
windows to the roof of a shed. It was at
this point that most of those injured suf
fered. On the north side of the building
several women escaped down a ladder
raised by Mrs. George Caldwell and Mrs.
Rend, residents of the neighborhood.
Lakeport's Water System.
LAKEPORT. July 3.â The preliminary

BRYAN WANTS
THURMAN FOR
RUNNING MATE
Desires the Ohioan to Offset
the Influence of Harri
son at Chicago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, July 3.â William J. Bryan
distrusts the Chicago Democrats, for he
fears that Mayor Harrison will bob up
to bother him in the National Demo
cratic Convention in 1900. Mayor Har
rison has too many sound money
friends in the Democratic party to suit
the Nebraska leader, and in addition
the Chicago executive wants to make
trusts the leading Democratic issue in
the campaign next year instead of sil
ver.
Mr. Bryan is credited with a desire to
have Allen W. Thurman as his running
mate next year, being convinced that
the Ohio man will be a leader of the
Democratic hosts. In fact, Mr. Bryan,
at a conference yesterday in this city,
announced that Mr. Thurman was his
choice. His desire to put up Mr. Thur
man for Vice President seems to be
based on the presentations made by
himself that he could carry, Ohio for
tho Democratic ticket. He told of the
Republican dissatisfaction in that
State, which, according to his views,
gives the Democrats an - excellent
chance to elect their State ticket this
year. In the event of success next No
vember, he said the way to victory in
the national election of 1900 would be
easy. In case Mr. Thurman is made
the Vice Presidential nominee it is said
the Democratic party will make Ohio
one of its chipf battle-grounds, hoping
to defeat McKinley by the adverse vote
of his own State. In IS9S Mr. Bryan
caught the galleries at the Chicago con
vention and received the Democratic
nomination for President, but if the Na
tional Democratic Convention is held in
Chicago next year he has some fear
that he cannot do this again, because
Mayor Harrison and his friends are not
Bryan men. Mr. Harrison was not at
yesterday's conference, and Mr. Bryan
thinks the Mayor may pack the gal
leries with other than Bryan men. Mr.
Bryan does not care for an Eastern
Vice Presidential candidate next year,
as he thinks the East is against him
anyway, and still an "enemy's coun
try." That is why he has taken at once
merely to the Thurman idea.
AN INCREASE IN THE

Ninety-Four Cases and Seventeen
Deaths in the Vicinity of
Santiago de Cuba.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA. July 3.â An in
crease in the number Â«f new cases of yel
low fever and a decrease in the death rate
are the striking features of the situation.
There have been ninety-four cases up to
date, of which seventeen have proved
fatal. Eleven out of the first fifteen at
tacked succumbed to the diseasp. Near
ly all were camp followers of the drinking

has really been small.
To-day the medical corps was rein

and 'lt is impossible to overestimate the
devotion and heroism of the medical men.
There is no fever in the city.
HAVANA. July 3.â Dr. Baker sailed

FURTHER PROPOSALS
NOT TO BE CONSIDERED
If the Alaskan Boundary Question Is
Not Soon Settled the Frontier
Will Be Garrisoned.
NEW YORK, July 3.â A Journal special
from Washington pays: A high official of
the State Department said to-day con
cerning the Alaskan boundary that the

there was no intention on the part of this
Government to listen to further proposals
the essential object of which was to ob
tain unreasonable concessions of Ameri

"The only possible chance I now see for
I a settlement." said this official, "is that
England may induce Canada to see that
all "of these propositions before the Joint
High Commission will be Impossible of
consideration, if the provisional boundary
i line be not first fixed. In other words, all
! of Canada's chances for reciprocities with
the United States will be Wiled summar
ily if the Alaskan boundary business is
not settled and at once.
"In case of a final disagreement on the
provisional line, the United States will be
obliged to garrison Pyramid Harbor.
which is now without a garrison, at the
request of Great Britain, and other places
! on the frontier, in the interest of Ameri
j can citizens in the disputed territory."

PROTESTS AGAINST
PRESENT POLICY
Address Adopted by the
Social Conference.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUFFALO, N. V.. July 3-â At the meet
â¢ the Social Conference to-day an ad
dress read by Professor Herron criticixmÃ
the Philippine policy and the alleged ten
dency to autocracy waa adopted, but the
vote was subsequently reconsidered aitcr
a number of addresses denouncing sucn
action. Pandemonium ensued aa motion
after motion waa ad Ijpeaker after
Bpeaker was heard or suppressed. Finally
an address to the public was taken u\>
seriatim. From time to time, some dele
gate would arise In a spirit of desperation
trying to protest against the language of
the address.
The first paragraph denounced ' the war
,( Â, n qui 31 ctermination." Th >
word "extermination" was stricken out.
The words "lawless and Irresponsible'
were stricken from the paragraph re
ferring to military control in Idaho.
The address as adopted refers to 'â¢the
two great evils of militarism and plutoc
racy which now menace the existence of
the republic."
The former, it declares, is expressed in
our war of conquest in the. Philippines; In
our contini ' !Ã¼ba; In the
private use of the United States army for
the complete and instant overthrow of
civil government in Idaho and the â¢
lishment of military despotism in the cor
porate and private use of military force
to destroy and terrorize organized labor
and In the monstrous public corruptions
that have grown out of our Spanish and
Philippine h
â¢â¢The nation," the address contii
"that strikes at the liberties of an
nation commits national suicide. We
not too greatly emphasiz â¢ I that
the militarism that seeks c >nq
hap for Its ultimate purpose the destruc
tion of organized labor at home an i the
defense of the Government by injum ttons
of the Federal courts, which have usurped
the functions of legislation and have set
â aside the laws of the land."
An appeal Is made to the public to join
in the demand for the granting of the
liberties pledged to the Filipinos. Mili
tarism Is declared to be bui the offsjring
and Incident of the greati r menace of
plutocracy which has established monop
oly government.
"By economic force." pays the address,
"based upon special prtviliges in law and
natural resources, upon Indiscreet taxa
tion and consequent political competition,
monopoly Is centralizing the wealth of
the nation In the hands of enormous
trust?, which are becoming Irresponsible
economic despotisms; which are using
legislation, the judiciary and all the func
tions of gi ' as the mere instru
ment of private profits; which are reduc
ing the entire people to economic serf
dom or enforce d wage slavery."
"Political liberty," the address declares,
"is a mockery without economic liberty.
Even the further extension of the suf
frage, so as to grant political citizenship
to women, winch extension we urge? ana
advocate, will avail little <>r nothing with
out economic freedom to all. We there
fore make urgeni appeal I i people to co
operate with us in th" institution of such
movements and the support of Mich men
as shall propose, first, direct l'-gi
and proportionate representation; direct
taxation, public ownership of public utili
ties or monopolies growing out of nat

LESS DANGER
OF WAR IN
TRANSVAAL
It Is Thought the Britons
and Boers Will Amicably
Settle Differences.
Special Dispatch to The Catt.
PRETORIA, July 3.â The A T nlkf-rnad
by a vote of 14 to 13 has decided to give
i an additional member for Pretoria and
each district having only one member
. now.
Herr Fischer, the envoy from the
Orange Free State, had a long inter
view with President Kruger on the
! question of the franchises to-day. It
;is expected that Herr Hoftmeier, the
Afrikander leader, will join in the con
ference to-morrow.
WASHINGTON, July B.â Rear Ad
miral Howlson is of the opinion that
war between Great Britain and the
: Transvaal Republic is not as certain as
I has been supposed. This is shown by
the fact of his purpose to sail from
Delagoa Bay en the cruiser Chicago on
Wednesday for Cape Town. In a
| cablegram to the Navy Department to
; day regarding the cracking of the lin
â  ing of the low-pressure cylinder, which
will have to be repaired at Cape Town,
' Admiral Howison announced lhat he
would sail in July for that point As it
is understood he has visited Pretoria,
j where he met the American Consul and
Boer officials, jt is presumed that he is
satisfied that American interests are in
! no immediate danger.
No report has yet reached the State
: Department from the Consul at Pre*
toria Bhowing an alleged appeal to him
,by American residents of the Trans
| vaal for a guard of marines to provide
! protection for them and their property
i in the event of war, and Rear Admiral
i Howlson has not mentioned such re
i quest in his dispatches to the Navy De
partment. The authorities are there
fore forced to the conclusion that there
is no immediate danger of war, as a
result of Admiral Howison's observa
tions, and in fact the State Department
reports show that the trouble will prob
ably be amicably arranged. The fact
j that the Chicago will sail a week ahead
of the date fixed in her itinerary as that
upon which she should leave Delagoa
Bay is another indication of Admiral
Howison's confidence in the contin
uance of peace. It is said at the de
> partment that the Chicago's injury is
slight and can readily be repaired at
! Cape Town.

! resolutions State President Newby intro
duced his successor, Sam W. Brown of

IN FAVOR OF

Railroads' Decision as to
Coast Jobbers.
â *.â
STAND BY GRADED RATES
GKEAT NORTHERN AND NORTH
ERN PACIFIC CHARGES.
Refuse to Make Concessions in Regard
to Shipments Into Washing
ton, Oregon and Cali
fornia.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PAUL, Minn.. July 3.â The Great
Northern and Northern Pacific to-day
announced their decision fn favor of
j the Middle West in the controversy
I with the Pacific Coast jobbers as to
: rates to North Pacific Coast points. The
| roads refuse to grant the revision of
; the freight tariffs required by the coast
S jobbers of the Twin Cities, Duluth, Chi
| cago and St. Louis. The ro-ads abandon
the theory of "stamp" rates and declare
I their determination to stand by the sys
i tern of graded rates as regards ship
j ments into Washington, Oregon and
| California.
The decision is addressed to W. P. I
Wheeler, chairman of the Pacific Coast !
traffic committee, and is signed by D. '
Miller, vice president of the Great
Northern, and J. M. Hanaford, vice
president of the Northern Pacilic.
In stC.bÃta.nce tht- statement says:
"The principal contention you make is !
against what you term our departure
from the principle of postage or "stamp i
rate,' destroying your natural advant
age of location whirh enables vessels i
to load the manufactures of the Atlan- j
tic seaboard and land them at our dors j
at the lowest possible cost.
"This is a question where our inter
ests are so seriously affected that al
though the system of graded rates may
be dangerous to our interests, we must j
disagree with your suggestions and at- j
tempt with due deference to the com
mercial interests of the whole country
to break away from the old plan of the !
postaye stamp rate and establish a I
graded basis. If it is right to apply
postage stamp rates from all the
sources of supply in the East, it is right
to apply postage stamp rates to the
points of consumption in the West.
"Such application erf the postage
stamp principle would make the States
from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast !
the maximum for all intermediate busi- !
ness. Such an adjustment of rates is
not what either of us desire. We do
not feel that we can successfully de
fend the position advocated by your pe
tition nor that its adoption would be j
for your best interest or our own."
SUITS AGAINST UNION
BANK STOCKHOLDERS
Small Holders Defendants in an Ac
tion Brought in Justice's
Court.
SAX JOSE, July 3.â One of the suits i
brought against the stockholders of the j
defunct Union Savings Bank to recover
their pro rata liability was fairly started i
before Justice Wallace to-day. It is the I
case of C. W. Childs and others, to whom j
had been assigned the claims of 400 <le
posltors, against Elizabeth Angus and |
seventy-nine stockholders. The stock
holders sued are all small holders, and for j
this reason the suit was brought in the i
Justice Court. A demurrer and several .
answers were filed. Attorney J. R. Welch
appeared for the depositors and S. G.
Tompkins and others for the stockholders.
Attorney Welch, for the depositors, said
It would take a month to try the case if
all Issues were gone into in court. He j
suggested the feasibility of all attorneys j
interested getting together in his oiftci\ |
where the data were conveniently ar- i
ranged, and settling as many ract3 ;>.s !

admit they were barred.
His suggestion was acted upon, and the
several attorneys will meet on Wednes

perhaps, beyond the expectation or
lii- country, it i<- i:o fault of the Govern

Every battle has been a victoray. The

fnught more dauntlessly under greater
ships than the heroes who have:

There has b< en no lack of vigor
ous leadership and no lack of faithful and |
.-â  service in the ranks. The oniy
troubii â  n our numbers have nol
I enough to overwhelm the in- t
f-utgents and crush the rebellion.
Wl, â  fault, if there be? What
is the public feeling: within the past
weeks? The American people have not:
changed our spirit or purpose; they man
fully accepted the responsibilities and the
which came with the war of last
year; and they accept them now. They:
thoughi of shrinking from the
which have fallen upon them.
Instead of abandoning this work they are 'â 
the- more determined to proceed with it,
and their feeling is not one of heslta- |
tion and doubt, but rather one of impa
icomplish Immediate and con- j
elusive results. Hence comes the sug
n thai the President shall call out
the full maximum of volunteers with the.
l.upf- of crushing the revolt in a short
and decisive campaign. This is a natural
impulse and it deserves to be treated in a I
frank and candid manner.
What, then, was the situation? I am |
re to criticize. Bach branch of the
Government is responsible for its own ac- I
tion. But it is only fair and just to state
facts and tn show precisely what the 1
President h;*d to meet. Not only did the i
opposition, by delay in the ratification of;
the treaty, encourage the insurrection,
but the emasculated army bill crippled
the power of suppressing It. The Presi
dent was compelled at the same time to
face the revolt and face a practical re- !
construction of the army. T'nder the stat- \
ute, when the treaty of peace with Spain
was ratified not only was every volunteer
entitled to be discharged, but every reg
ular above 27.. r >oo was required to be mus- !
ti rod out. The President then was con
fronted, in the midst of the Insurrection
v.ith the problem of relieving a large part
of the force in the Philippines and of
being compelled to substitute new levies. !
He stood face to face with the difficulty, I
In the presence of a force already too
small, of withdrawing more than 10,000
trained and disciplined men from the!
fighting line while the campaign was at I
Its height and of filling their places with !
new forces.
Had the volunteers exercised their
rights of immediate discharge our army !
would have been seriously crippled and !
disastrous results might have followed.
But. to their undying honor be it said,
they made answer which reflects immortal
glory upon the American citizen and the

LAKE FOREST, 111., July Xâ The fifth
annual tourr.ament of the United States
i Golf Association was started to-day over
the eight-hole course of the Onwentsia
Golf Club. The weather was Ideal for
golf. The sky was overcust with clouds,
and a light, cool breeze blew over the
course, quickly drying last night's rain
from the greens. Even before Secretary
Robert Ji.'ig^Kerr started the initial pair
of contestants in the first qualifying round
the beautiful grounds and the clubhouse
were thronged with gayly dressed women
and their escorts, wl.lle all over the courÂ»e i
the red-coated golfers were scattered,
taking a lust critical look at the links
before starting in their week's struggle
for the amateur golf championships.
When, promptly at 7:30 a. m., Walter
McKittrick of the St. Louis Country Club
and Phelps B. Hoyt of the Glen View Golf j
Club opened the tournament the little
grandstand at the first teeing ground was
filled to overflowing with golf enthusiasts,
and ac Mr. Hoyt, who had the honor,
drove his ball far over the bunker down
the slope of the green beyond, thus form
ally opening the tournament, a hearty
round of applause was given. Mr. McKit
trick also cleared the first of the bunkers
beautifully, and he was also applauded.
Four minutes after they were away and
had played their second shots and passed
out of range of the next golfer's drive, the
secretary called the next pair of contest
ants, D. M. Cummings of Washington Park
Club and P. W. Harvey of the Cleveland
Golf Club, and thereafter, at intervals of
four minutes, the players who are com
peting for national championship honors,
drove and were away until the long list
had been completed. As the celebrities
appeared to start on their long journey
over the course, they were applauded lib
erally. Findlay S. Douglass made a beau
tiful drive In his opening round with W.
C. Carnegie Jr. of the Allegheny Club, the
longest up to that time, but four minutes
later James H. Tynge of the Morris Coun
ty Golf Club beat It by many yards.
Messrs. McKittrick and Hoyt finished

REDDING. July 3.â The people of Kes
wick are to hold a Fourth of July cele- :
bration to-morrow. On account of the
gaseous fumes from the Mountain Copper
Company's smelters no trees or vegeta

was raised and to-day a large force of
men was engaged in cutting trees in the
hills and hauling them to Keswick, when)
they are being erected about the streets.
The imported foliage completely trans- i
forms the appearance of the smelter town.

course, Bar. McKittrlck doing the eighteen
holes in 101, while Mr. Hoyt took 99.
It Is the general opinion of the golf ex
perts that, considering the almost perfect
condition of the course. 190 will 1..- the
highest to qualify, while the .scores will
run from that down to 170. Some of the
experts haw- been showing such good
form that scores even lower than 170 were
looked for.
By 10 o'clock the contestants began to
come in rapidly from their nrat muni over
the course. High scores were the rule,
many of the players apparently being af
flicted with nervousness. It was in tno
putting that most of the golfers fell by
the wayside, running the scores of the
first round in many instances around the
hundred mark.

best amateur light-weight on the coast.
As both men were fighting strongly at the
end of the twentieth round the fight was
declared a draw, as per agreement.

Srocial Dlspntrh to The Call.
TACOMA, July a.â News of Cape
Nome from one who has actually been
there and staked claims is contained in
a late issue of the Klondike Nugget.
Charles Walker, lirst mate of the j
I steamer Yukoner, who is vouched for i
by his captain as a man at honor and j
trustworthiness, brought the news to ,
| Dawbon. The two recently arrived in
Daw son with the steamer Oil City as
! guests of Captain Basey, and it was on ;
ihis boat that Mr. Walker was inter- ;
viewed about his winter trip over the i
snow and ice to the new gold fields. I
[ His is the first interview obtained from
a man whc- has actually been to the
Nome diggings.
"1 first heard of the discovery from
! Mr. Kjellman, superintendent of the
i reindeer station at Eden," said Walker,
' "and was shown by him some >of the
gold taken from the Snake River coun
i try. 1 was satisfied at once that it
came from the new field, as it is unlike
I any gold found elsewhere in Alaska or
i the Northwest, and 1 have seen it all.
There arc three different shades of
\ color, one very light, one quite dark |
I and a third of medium hue. Being in- j
; terested in the strike and having plenty j
oi unie 1 decided to investigate. Ac- |
cordingly on February '22 1 left the
Russian mission and started on the 400- j
I mile tramp. I first went to St. Michael,
j which 1 found much excited, news hay- i
ing reached there long before. The dis.
< ivery, 1 learned, was made last fall by
' three men, one of whom is named Eng
! blom. They were obliged to go out for
1 provisions and while at St. Michael |
they tipped their secret off to a tium- j
ber of the big companies' people and to '
Dr. A. N. Tittlesen. These tried to keep
; the Information from getting out and ;
I began to outfit men for the diggings, j
but one of the latter let the cat out ,
Of the bag while intoxicated, and then !
everybody joined the rush.
"I hired a man to accompany me and
, started. I found everything in the
neighborhood of the discovery staked,
; but was able to stake a claim on Dry
Creek and to buy another on Alpha
j ("reek. Although the discoverers had
, been able to reach bedrock at from four
to ten feet before the winter set in, the
gold they had washed was shoveled!
from the bed of streams with men in !
the water. No one was woaking while
I was there. There is no timber to :
burn in thawing the ground.
â¢"AbTiut twenty cabins had been built I
at the mouth of Snake River, and the
place named Anvil City. There were
260 people in the district. I learned j
that all the gold found up to that time i
had come In from three creeks, known
as Bowlder Creek, Dry Creek and An
vil ("reek, but it is a large district, and
I am satisfied that gold will be found
on many other creeks. A great deal of
staking was done by power of attor
i ney. I know one man who staked â 
I ninety claims. Judge Shephard. United ;
States Commissioner at St. Michael, '
j paid $1000 for a half interest in a claim -
| In discovery of Dry Creek. It was de
cided that placer claims shall be lo- j
ated 1320 by 660 feet. Claims may be
located by power of attorney, but
power of attorney must be recorded j
prior to the location of notices. All :
claims must be recorded within forty
days after the notice is posted.
Undoubtedly that country is one of the
most promising in the Yukon district.
It was determined that water used for
I mining or otherwise taken from a natu
-1 ral watercourse must be turnefl back
I into the watercourse at the lower end
of each claim. Dr. A. N. Tittlesen was
elected District Recorder for a term of
! two years, his fees to be $2 SO for re
! cording any kind of document."

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS LOSS
TWENTY-TWO COUNTIES UNDEE
WATER.
Work of Rescuing Stranded People
Prosecuted Tirelessly in the
Lowlands Along the
Brazos.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Texas, July 3.â ln some local
ities of the flooded district of Texas the
situation is improving. The rains during
the past twenty-four hours have not been
so general, but a terrific rainfall is re
ported to have occurred between Hearne
and Hempstead. The Brazos River is
falling ir> its upper course, but is still
slowly rising and inundating additional
territory near the gulf.
All hope of the flooded cotton surviving
has now passed owing- to the long period
that It has been under water. Prominent
cotton buyers who are familiar with the
yield and productiveness of the flooded
region estimate that the total number of
prospective bales of the staple lost by
the high waters is not less than 500,000.
If this statement is anywhere near cor
rect the monetary loss from this source
alone is fully $8,000,000.
Reports that are now beginning to come
in from the southern counties in the flood
ed region bear out the accuracy of the
report. There are about twenty-two coun
ties almost completely covered by water,
and the estimated loss of cotton in each
county la from 16,000 to 30,000 bales. If- the
waters subside in time there will be some
replanting done.
The railroad companies have everything
in readiness for quick work in making
repairs to roadbed, track and bridges
when the waters recede. Each of the
affected lines has dispatched -work trains
and hundreds of laborers to the water's
edge, and as fast as the flood goes down
the rebuilding will be carried on.
The report of the washing away of the
steel bridge of the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas Railroad at Little River was un
founded. The approaches to the bridge
were washed out, but the repairs to the
bridge were quickly made and traffic was
delayed for a short time.
The work of rescuing of waterbound
men, women and children in the Brazos
bottoms continues. In many instances the
rescued people are in a pitiful condition
when found. Some of them have been in
tree tops and other places of refuge for
three days in almost continuous rain and
without food. The bottoms are being
thoroughly searched and every effort is
being made to succor every stranded per
son, "negro or white. There are no further
reports of loss of life.
No news was received here to-day from
Calvert in regard to the large number of
negroes reported missing in the territory
covered by the junction of the Brazos and
Little Brazos rivers. Telephone advices
were received here to-day from Navasota
Stating that where the Brazos and Nava
sota rivers meet, below that town, the
water is about eight miles wide. Many
residences and costly plantation buildings
In "Jrimes County have been washed
away, and the backwater is reported to
have flooded some of the houses in the
town of Navasota.

DIXON PICKS UP
SOME EASY MONEY
Gets the Decision After Three Lively
Rounds With Sam Bolan at
Louisville.
LOUISVILLE (Ky.i, July 3.â George
Dixon, champion featherweight, picked up
a little easy money here to-night on his
way to Denver. He got the decision after
three lively rounds with Sam Bolan of
York, before the Nonpareil Athletic Asso
ciation. Bolan was practically out when
the 'â¢ound was concluded. The bout was
to have gone twenty-five rounds, and a
good crowd gathered at Music Hall to
witness it. Dixon went right after his
man the n,rst round, but Bolan held his
own.
The second saw some warm fighting and
the beginning of the end of the New
Yorker. Dixon whooped up in lively fash
ion and soon had Bolan going. A left
swing sent Sam to the Moor, and he stayed
down nine seconds. The rest did him lit
tle good, however, for he came up groggy
in the third and George set about to tin
ish him. After a fey moments of fiddling
to get his bearings the colored boy sent
in a hot right and left on the jaw and Bo
lan collapsed. He again took his limit to
rise. and then came up with a pronounced
stagger. Dixon was waiting and a neat
swing on the jaw with his left was all
that was necessary to put an end to the
bout. Bolan went down in a heap, but the
gong sounded before the limit was count
ed. The New Yorker was out of it, bow
ever, and the referee gave the bout to
Dixon.
COURSING MUST CEASE.
Emphatic Declaration Made by May
or Eaton at Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, July 3.â Mayor Fred
Eaton is determined that the fiasco that
yesterday attended the attempt to pie
vent coursing at Agricultural Park shal]
not be repeated to-morrow if F. D. Black
carries out his design to run hounds after
hares. At a special session of the Police
Commission this afternoon the Inability
of Chief Glass to comply with the Mayor's !
distinct orders was investigated.
"Positive instructions were given the
Chief to stop gambling and coursing to
day." said Mayor Eaton. "He failed; the j
Police Commission wants to know why. I !
wMH see whether the laws are to be over
ridden. I shall go to the Dark in person
with a detachment of police and make
arrests by the wholesale."

NEARLY A MILLION
DOLLARS IN GOLD
Treasure Cargo Brought
by the Tees.
DAWSON ALMOST DESERTED
WILD RUSH TO THE CAPE NOME
DIGGINGS.
Justice Irving Barely Escapes Being
Ridden on a Rail by Angry
Miners at Atlin
City.
Special Dl.Â«r>atch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C., July 3.â The steam
ship Tees, which returned from Skagway
early this morning with 120 Klondikers,
brought treasure to the amount of 1800,000.
The miners who arrived by the Tees came
up the river on the steamers Bonanza
King, Ora and Canadian. The men that
reached Skagway from these vessels, and
most of whom came down on the Tees,
brought out collectively the greatest
amount of wealth that has passed through
Skagway this year at any one time. Sev
eral sacks of from 100 to 400 pounds were
known to have been deposited in safe
places around the town, and, considering
the wads of bills and drafts which were
concealed, the total was estimated at not
less than $1,000,000. Probably 50 per cent
more would be nearer the amount.
Among the most conspicuous bag? of
gold on the Tees was that of V. W. Hay
ward of Vancouver. He brought out 180
pounds avoirdupois in an old grip tied with
ropes. At $16 an ounce his bag is worth
$46,000. J. F. Canyon of Baker City, Or.,
brought out 120 pounds tied up in an old
blanket. J. J. Crawford and wife of Seat
tle who have claims on El Dorado,
brought out $50,000. Archie Beaton had
$40 000, W. B. Hunt of Seattle $30,000, John
D ' McLean $50,000, Henry Wilkinson. W.
Grieve and A. Van Houten of Nanalmo
$10,000 each; W. McKay, a lawyer of Ot
tawa, $20,000. There were a number hav
ing smaller sacks, ranging from $2000 to
$6000. ,; ,
The tale of gold, however, became In
significant in the light of the stories of
what was happening on the Yukon when
the miners left. All the Klondike is in
the throes of such a mad stampede as has
never before been witnessed in the in
terior. It is little short of a complete
exodus to Cape Nome.
The stampeders raced to Nome at the
signal of the three miners who reached
Dawson from there. The trio left Cape
Nome in the spring, traveled over the Ice
from St. Michael to a point, as near as
could be learned, between Minook and
Circle City, where they boarded a steamer
and continued their journey to Dawson,
arriving about June 10. Their reports of
the new diggings set Dawson in a blaze
of excitement.
Three river steamersâ the * Columbia
Navigation Company's Sovereign, the
Mary E. Graff (formerly of the famous
Moran fleet) and the Arnoldâ all crowded
with Cape Nome stampeders, left Daw
son between June 12 and 14. They are now
well on their way to the new camp, hav
ing, no doubt, already passed St. Michael.
The river was crowded with boats and
scows, on which "thousands were drifting
down. â â
A report reached Skagway on June 2..
the day before the Tees sailed, to the
effect that Atlin's new Judge, Justice
Irving narrowly escaped a ride on a rail
a few' nights ago. The Judge was ad
dressing a large crowd of miners at an
open meeting on one of the streets, the
crowd being made up of all nationalities,
with Canadians largely predominating.
Judge Irving informed the miners that
he had come among them to straighten
out all entanglements and controversies
regarding the ownership of claims, which
announcement was cheered lustily. Fur
ther along in his remarks Judge Irving
announced that in cases where the own
ership of a claim was being contested
each claimant, no matter whether there
were two or twenty, would be required
to pay into the court, the sum of $23
before his case would be considered.
Then it was that Bedlam is said to
have broken loose. Some one shouted,
"Ride him on a rail!" This cry was taken
up by the crowd and some one went to
get a" rail. The cooler men prevented the
plan being' carried out.
A ten-ounce nugget was recently taken
from a claim on Pine Creek. A rich
strike is reported from Tanana section
and a stampede has "taken place from
Minook. Big coal veins have been found
near Rampart City.
NO IMMEDIATE STRIKE
AT THE STOCKYARDS
CHICAGO, July 3.â A1l talk of an im
mediate general strike at the stock
yards is apparently over, the leaders
having decided to spend the entire sum
mer in organizing their farces. By
September they say they will be able
to back up their demands with a good
show of strength. A committee of 100
will be appointed to add new members
to the proposed organization.
The packing-houses are running as of
yore and express much satisfaction at
the outcome of the trouble, putting lit
tle faith in the assertions that there
will be another demand made on them
in the fall. The 200 patrolmen who
have for the past week kept guard over
the yards were to-day withdrawn. Most
of the strikers have asked to be re
turned to their former positions.
SANTA MONICA ROAD RACE.
LOS ANGELES, July 3.â The Santa
Monica road race to-morrow will he a
memorable event, as HO entries have been
booked. This exceeds the number for all
similar meets ever held in Southern Cali
fornia. The race is under the auspices
of the Associated Cycling Clubs, an or
ganization representing the Wanderers,
the Oberons and the East Skiers. Roma
Dow will be the official handlcapper. As
he was chosen unanimously, all objections
on allowances have been eliminated. The
course will be the full eighteen miles over
the Ballona route, the finish being in
Ocean View avenue, in this city. The
road has been put into excellent condi
tion It is expected some local records
will 'be smashed. The contestants will \n\

Dreyfus, when able to speak, thanked
11. Demange for his dev< ted services.
M. Demange then presenf<^ M. La

had championed his cause. '
MM. Demange and Labori then gave
the prisoner a general review of all
which has happened since Dreyfus was
sent to Devils Island. Dreyfus explain

the proceedings of the Court of Cassa
tion in 1898.
MM. Demange and Labori then left.
They were both greatly impressed with
the appearance of Dreyfus. They de
clared Dreyfus was both physically
and mentally In much better health
than they anticipated.
Madame Dreyfus visited her husband
this afternoon. She has received per
mission to call upon him each day.
This evening Maitres Demange and
Labori had another conference with the
prisoner, M. Labori saying after it was
over that the time had been devoted
to continuing the review of events
since 1898. His counsel was surprised
at Captain Dreyfus' strength of mem
ory even in trifling matters and at the
lucidity of mind he displayed. After
the interview they dined with Mine.
Dreyfus.
Late this evening it was ascertained
that unless the authorities should de
clare a preliminary inquiry or the ex
amination of Captain Dreyfus, Major
Carrier? the Government commissioner
charged with the preparation of the
case against the prisoner, will merely
draw up a report, which will be pre
sented to the court-martial. Maitre
Demange returned to Paris this even

VALUABLE ADDITIONS
TO STANFORD MUSEUM
Art Collection and a Group of Fur
Seals Presented to the Uni
versity.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY", July 3.â
The museum at Leland Stanford Jr. Unl
verslty has just received the lirst install- j
inent of the valuable art collection of the ;
Stanford- home at Washington, D. C,
which is being transferred to the insti- I
tution. This collection was gathered
while the late Mr. Stanford was I'nited
Senator from California. The first
carload has heen unpacked and is now
bÂ«ing arranged under the direction of
Samuel W. Charles, who is in charge of |
the museum. The greater part of the col
lection consists or paintings, of which i
there are forty-seven. The most notable I
of these la a fine copy by Steams of the
famous Queen Ivoulse. Besides this there j
are a few historical paintings, some ;
sketches of the Italian peasantry and a '
bi ri< b of Neapolitan views with which the â 
Stanford family was so familiar. There
arc two elegant painted tapestries and a
statue of a Moorish dancer.
In addition to the paintings, there is a
large collection of vases, ancient and
modern, from various European countries
and Japan, and a few pieces of rare stat
uary, some of which date back to the j
early Egyptian dynasties.
â  Another valuable acquisition of the
museum which has just arrived is a series
of fur seals and a panther, presented by
President David Starr Jordan. During
Dr. Jordan's last visit to the Pribilof j
Islands as Seal Commissioner he collected
v number of skins of the fur peals for
natural history purposes, on his return
h<- presented these to various educational
Institutions, Stanford. Berkeley, Biftwn,
Vassal ana Minnesota universities being'"
among the lucky ones. The Stanford col
lection consists of a whole family, includ
ing a noble bull seal, a bachelor seal, a
cow and two pups, all mounted in lifelike
attitudes. The sniffing and mounting
were done hy \V. i. Nolle, the San Fran
cisco taxidermist. Dr. Jordan was pre
d with the panther skin during his
receni trip to i'reka, and he gave it to
the university museum.

where thousands of persons live. Nor is it
alone the swamp lands that breed malaria, for
right In our densely populated cities malaria
abounds.
No person is entirely exempt from malaria. It â

fatal shot.
When the jury concluded its delibera
tions, Rice was patrolling his beat on J
street. A warrant was immediately is
sued and he was taken to jail by Deputy
Sheriff Nelson. Ba:i was refused him on
the recommendation of District Attorney
Everts and he spent the night in the

Donnelly was shot while resisting ar

Chinatown quarter and drew his revolver
on a number of the residents. Among
those whose lives he threatened was
"Jack" Brooks. During his row with
Brooks. Officer Rice attempted to arrest
him. The policeman commanded Don

of doin;? so the disturber shot at the of

the offender, and when his ammunition
was exhausted told Brooks to fire. Dur

The arrest of Rice promises to stir up a ,
bitter political fight. Many of his friends,
among whom are the wealthiest citizens
! of Fresno, declare that his arrest is the
result of spite work on the part of his
political enemies. Rice is a Republican
and was appointed by the new Board of
! Trustees about two months ago. At the
j time of Rice's appointment John D. Mor
gan, the Democratic City Marshal, made i
a bitter speech against the young man. !
declaring he could not work in union with

BUFFALO, N. V.. July 3.-Frank Erne
of this city met George Lavigne of Sagi
naw, Midi., in the arena of the Haw
thorr.e Athletic Club at Cheektowaga, a
suburb of this city, to-night, and after
fighting twenty fierce and clever rounds
wrested the lightweight championship of
the world from the Western man. Over
7000 persons witnessed the contest, which
was brimful of exciting episodes and of
hard and scientific hitting. Lavigne went
down to defeat and surrendered the title
in a most creditable manner. He was
plucky and game to the core, and for the
lirst "half dozen rounds more than held
his own against his adversary. In the
seventh round Lavigne received a terrible
drubbing and was saved from a. knockout
.only by the timely interference of the
S Â°Evr.e weighed in at 133% and Lavigne at
13.'. pounds. Lavigne was the favorite,
much money being bet on him at odds of
100 to !K>. When the men stripped Lavigne
looked to be the more finely drawn. Both
were cool and confident. As the fight pro
grossed Lavigno's coolness vanished, while
Erne never lost his .-â  If-posseslon far a
moment. The Buffalo boy simply battered.
the tie out of his opponent, and, while
not escaping a good deal of punishment,
he administered a terrific drubbing to La
vigne. Toward the end of the bout La
vigne's guard was useless and nothing but
sheer gameness kept the "Saginaw Kid"
from going under. Blow after blow fell
upon his head and body with relentless
force, but he stood the gaff and fought
back pluckiiy as best he could.
Lavigne's seconds were his brother,
"Billy 1 - Lavigne; "Jimmy" Robinson oi
New Orleans, "Jack" Hanley of Phila
delphla and â â¢Billy" St. Mary of Saginaw,
Mich. Erne's seconds were Frank Blmper
and "Billy" Huber of Buffalo. The men
were announced to box twenty rounds to
a decision for the lightweight champion
ship of the world. The timekeener fur
Lavigne was "Jim" Young of San Fran
cisco. 'â â  ' â 
When "Honest John" Kelly entered the
ring he was greeted with tumultuous
cheers, and the sports around the ringside
shouted:
"You're all right. We know we will get
an honest run ior our money."
"Jim" Corbett stepped into the ring and
addressed the crowd, saying:
"Gentlemen, I am getting Into the best
of shape and will be ready again to con
test for the heavy-weight championship
with the winner of the Jeffries-Sharkey
fight."
Lavigne looked to be in excellent condi
tion. As soon as the men had donned tho
gloves "Jim" Kennedy, Erne's manager,
and "Billy" Lavigne, representing his
brother, entered the ring and had a con
sultation with Referee Kelly as to the
rules governing the contest. George Con
sidine was added to Lavigne's handlers
and gave the "Kid" some sound advice.
Then the boxers, with their handlers
joined in the parley with the referee as
to the rules, and they held the center of
the ring for fully fivs. minutes. As a re
sult of the confab it was announced that
the men had agreed to box under Mar
quis of Queensberry rules.

and face, which made the Kid groggy. In lees
than a half minute Erne landed a score of
Wows, while the Kid came back wildly, land
ing occasionally on the head, and it looked as
if the Kid would go out. His seconds called to
him: "Block, George." The bell saved I*a.-
V \ PT\ (*
Round George came Dp willingly, but Erne
was waiting for him, and it was evident that
Lavlgrne had loet much of his speed. Erne
watched his opportunity, and. instead of forcing
the fiehtintf. waited for â  -ler.f to come to
him. Erne blocked a left lead for the head and
hooked hi? left to the wind. Lavlgne then tried
several lefts for the face, but failed to land,
while Erne punished him on the body and out
foujrht him thn ughout the round.

several times, but Erne carefully avoided these
traps. Both dogged with swings and t blocked
continually all lead* Intended for the body.

lfft uppercut. Erne repeated this dose a second
later, and had all the best of the mill when

Round 10â I,a.vlf;ne's face was badly bruised
when he came up for this round and Erne
showed no irigna of punishment. Two hard
lefts from the Buffalo boy made LavlÃne rub
bis nose., which was bleed ing badly, and the
Ratrinaw man seemed unable to block Erne's
left ad*, three of which landed in quick
?ur<-e?sion on his mouth and nose. I>aviÃrnÂ»
tried a left for the face, hut received a forceful'
left uppprcut in the wind, which Erne follow

to the face, Lavijrne countering on the body.
Erne bored In at close qustrtefs..and, after tak
ing a left on the neck, Bhovtd bis right glove
over Lavigne's heart at the close of the round.
Round 11â The opening of this round was

but a second afterward sent a right smash to
the Kid's wind. Lavlgne booked hi* !'-fi twice
to the Bhort ribs and sprinted from Erne's

lieht left on the head and blocked a counter.
Lavigne forced, landing right on the body and
loft on the neck Erne countered <>n the ribs
and head. Lavigne' hooked his right to the
wind. Erne Beemed a bit tired and lacked the
aggressiveness of his opponent, who, although
having the worst of it, was ever ready with
both hands. The Kid feinted with right and
hooked hla left to the neck twice, after" which
he broke ground and saved himself. Layigne
played continually for the body, but received a
left smash on th.- nose which drew blood nnd
. ng separated them with Lavigne's stock
g a slight upward tendency.
Round 13 â Lavigne came up with a rush, but
did nothing. They exchanged lefts on the
tace .-<nd Krne pent a double let blow to tho
neck and ribs, following with a right to the
neck to which the Kid replied with left and
right' lightly on thÂ»> body. I^avlerne waited for

tho Kid and one of the Kid's seconds remon
strated, saying. "Why don't you tell them to
break. KellyT 1 The referee told the man to
shut up and there was no more Interference.
In th* meantime Erne was using both hands
with (rood effect oti the Kid's face, but La
vlgne was game.
Round 15- F.me was as cool as the prover
bial cucumber, while Lavigne was in evident
trouble when they came together. George
b >red In. but was driven back with strain-fit
lefts on the face, which were administered wTth
good Judgment. Erne essayed two lefts for
the body, which George blocked with his el
bow, but a third attempt by the Buffalo boy
was more successful, as he landed hard on the
abdomen. Two left leads from LavVgne were
â¢ d and then Erne hooked three hard
lefts to the wind and George returned to his
corner much the weaker of the two.
Round 16â While Iv&vtgne was In his corner
some of his seconds ai vised htm to take a
chance and Lavigne tried a right swing as
soon ac they shaped. Erne dodged and drove
his right hard to the body, bringing it up to
the head, at the same time blocking two lefts.
A straight left smash on the nose from Erne
forced the Kid to clinch, and after the break
Erne sent both bands to the body and a left
to the face, with scarcely a semblance of a
peturn. A left to the wind and a right to the
face were Erne's next contributions, and La
vigne's returns were simply love taps. Erne
drove right and left to the body and forced
the paco in a most one-sided style to the end
j of the round.
Round 17â They rushed to a clinch twice.
Erne l*>d his right for the body and hooked
his left to the neck, Lavigne countering on the
ribs A left lead to Lavigne's neck and a right
over the heart brought Levlgne to close quajv
ters. where Krne blocked a left hook for the
b !y. Lavigne tried a right for the chest.
Lavigne bored In with his left to the wind, but
was cent back with a cra^hlne left to the
Bt-imach. Lavigne then tried leading, but Erne
was too nimble and the round closed with the
odds very much In the local man's favor.
Round IS â Willing and game. Lavigne came
I to the scratch and. after taking Â«>evÂ»ral body
' punches threw his right over. landing under
Erne's jaw. Erne came back with a right
body punch and the Kid 'broke ground. Erne
feinted and landed a right swing on the neck.
After an exchange of body blows both clinched.
Erne, had the better of this round, but Ixi
vlgne's gamenese was more than remarkable.
Round 19 â Lavigne led twice for the jaw. but
Erne blocked him and sent two hard lefts to
the wind and pent his right to the heart. La
vigne hooked his right to the ribs, but his face
suffered from a right smash. The Kid. though
weary, tried to be aggr>-ssiv.-. with the result
that his damaged face received right and left
punches, and as he bore In on the body Erne
drove him back with a left over the heart. They
were sparring at the bell.
Round 20 â They shook hands In a gingerly
fashion and Lavigne tried a lead for the h"ad.
Erne broke ground, but came back immediately
with right and left on the face Lavigne's
countenance at this moment was anything but
prepossessing, both eyes being cir>ppd. Right
and left blows to the body brought Lavigne's
guard down, and then Erne smashed his right
to the neck and hooked his right to the face j
without a return Game to the core, Lavigne |
Withstood this punishment and went to his
opponent as If he were only beginning the bout.
Erne was relentless, however, and forced the
pace, fighting his man as if his life depended on
the result. Lavigne never weakened, but took
hts punishment like a stole, hut it was all day
with him, and. though beaten almost to a ]
standstill, he returned to his corner, having
lost the championship, but none of his many i
friends and admirers. '
GEORGE WHITNEY WINS THE
ALL=COMERS TOURNAMENT
Marvelous Tennis on
San Rafael
Courts.
THE best tennis ever played on
this coast was the verdict of the
spectators and racket wielders
who had gathered on the Hotel
Rafael courts to watch the sec
ond day's games of the Pacific
States Lawn Tennis Association. And
they were not amiss In their judgment,
for no such playing was ever seen In
the West as George Whitney and Sam
Hardy'a match of singles. The laurels
of the day went to the local man. and
his victory has set a new standard for
the game on this coast. All other
matches in which either Hardy or
Whitney figured were foregone conclu
sions and the latter is now the win
ner of the All-Comers' tournament of
1899. As euch he will meet Sumner
Hardy this afternoon for the cham
pionship of the Pacific Coast.
The tennis loving people of San Ra
fael, as well a.s the adjacent towns,
scented a battle from afar and gath
ered on the courts an hour before the
calling of the match. The western
stand was packed with women in light
summer array and men in duck cos
tumes. It was like the old days, when
tennis was the pet sport of the fash
ionable world, drawing society with a
magic wand. The principals appeared
a half hour later than the scheduled
time and the crowd settled down for
what was expected to be a two hours'
engagement.
To many the match was a surprise,
for Hardy had been picked the wln
ne- At any rate, it was thought that

every inch of ground before resultant
victory. After the struggle, when
Whitney had raptured the virtual
championship by defeating Hardy in
three straight setsâ and with compara
tive c.ise â there were many who could
not realize what had taken place.
The prettiest and fastest tennis was
that of the first set. It was a nip and
tuck affair, both men playing a care
ful and watchful grimo. First one man
would have the advantage aiid then
another. The games stood four all
and the victory at this point was
either man's. Then the local knight
of the asphalt spurted and by the
closest, hair-splitting, placing and ac
curate volleying won the next two
games ami the set.
A blistering sun had made itself felt,
and both men used the ten minutes'
rest by a plentiful external application
of water and ice. Robert N. Whitney
and Billy Plunkett acted as seconds to
the lccal athlete as he lay prone upon
the grass back of the clubhouse. Plun
kett fsnned him with a towel, while
the brother smeared cakes of ice over
his face and feet. Hardy was reretv
ing a similar treatment at the hands
of his friends.
The second set brought the brothers
of the principals to the side lines.

JEFFRIES ON RING METHODS.
Will Show His Recently Acquired
Style at Woodward's Pavilion
Thursday Night.
The Jeffries reception, which will be
given Thursday evening at Woodward's
Pavilion, will be unique in its way. Exhi
bitions as a â *-< are wearisome affair?,
an-' for that reason do not attract the
public, but the management, alive to that
fact, has arranged three ten-round con
tests between local men. They know a vic
tory will advance them some few steps in
their profession and they will be fighting
for blood. The bout between the heavy
weights. George Coster and Billy Meyers,
who styles himself champion of the
United States navy, should on that ac
count be particularly interesting. Another
feature of the exhibition will be the prac
tical demonstration by Jeffries of the re
turn to old ring methods in the way of
position, his pose in the ring now being
almost identical with that shown in the
old prints of Tom Cribb. Mendoza, tht*
Belchers and others. This must appear
in the nature of heretical doctrine to the
modern school, based on the Jem Mace
style. Jeffries has success in a champion
ship engagement as an indorsement of his
method.

In the second set Hardy won the

for a while. Whitney caught up, but

scoring in the set. Smashing, volley

accuracy. Whitney proved too much
for Sam Hardy, who soon became dis
heartened by his opponent's show of
racket cleverness. The score, 6-1, read
Hardy's utter defeat. When the two
faced each other for the third set
Hardy was totally vanquished. Still
rifts of the old-time spirit and- cour
age showed from time to time, and
Whitney had to battle for his victory.
Hardy' won but three games in the
third set. A double fault by him gave
the last point, game, set and match to
the man who won the championship
from him two years ago.
But one other match during the day
Is worthy of comment. It was the
semi-finals between Selby and Grant
Smith. The former, wearied and foot
sore, dragged himself through five
sets, after his opponent had scored two
against him.
The championship match this after
noon between George Whitney and
Sumner Hardy promises to be even
better tennis than that of yesterday.
Sumner and "Brother" Sam have been
playing an even game of late, and the
present champion will fight hard to re
tain his position on the tennis pedes
tal. In the morning there will be a
consolation doudes for all the losers.
The results of yesterday's play are:
Grant Smith beat Dr. Phillips, 3-6, 6-2,
6-2 6-4 Selby beat Roth, 6-4, 6-8, 6-3.
8-6. Whitney defeated Weihe, 7-5, 6-3,
6-3. Hardy won from Dibblee by de
fault. Selbv beat Smith. 2-6. 4-6, 6-3,
6-4. 6-1. Selby defaulted to Whitney,
who thereby won the tournament.

RAFAEL FINISHES SECOND.
Miss Edith McÃean Wins a Special
Match for a Valuable Silver
Cup Presented by J. B.
Crockett.
Miff Alice Moffltt of the Oakland Golf
Club has the honor of placing to her
credit the first win of the magnificent
challenge trophy presented to the Bur
lingame Country Club by Prince Andre
Foniatowski. All the clubs of the metro
politan district sent their best players to
thp competition at Burlingame yesterday,
making a most representative gathering.
None of the ten young women competing
played up to their usual standard, the
Dumber of spectators and the reeponsi
j bilities of the occasion weighing too heav
ily upon them.
As the Burlingame Club players have
not the opportunities of playing regularly
in open competition, thus raising the
standard of their game, a special trophy
I was offered for the member making the
i highest score in the challenge trophy
i match. The prize, a valuable silver cup,
presented by J. B. Crockett, was won by
Miss lvlith McÃean. Miss Genevieve
1 Qarolan and Miss Rowe played in the
match for the second prize, a silver-bound
leather scorebook. They played off the
tie at one hole. MiBS Rowe winning by a
score of 7 to 8.
Miss Oilman Brown and Miss McÃean
led off in the challenge match, and were
followed at short intervals by the others
until the five teams entered were on their
way around the links. By some strange
I intuition the majority of the spectators
â¢ waiter] for Miss Mortitt and Miss Rowe as
i though assured they would witness high
clafla playing. In this they were not dis
appointed. Mips Moffltt's play through
out was superb, although, according to
h>-r admirers, not up to her best form. She
is an ideal player, her every movement
being graceful. She is simple and unaf
fected in her manner, her self poise being
remarkable for a maid in her "teens."
She kept up a running fire of comment
I and small talk with the cavaliers In her
| train throughout the two rounds of the
links and at no time seemed disconcerted.
She was strong and accurate in driving
and was good on the approach. On the
first round her score was six strokes less
than the number made by her nearest
competitor. On the second round she
played too fast and fell off in her scor
ing^ She had trouble at the bunkers each
time. These hazards were deep water-
I courses, out of which it was impossible
for her to play the ball, causing her to
!be paralyzed. It took twelve strokes to
! make the sixth hole on the second round,
i where only six had been needed the first
Miss MoffHt had the services of Ralph
i Pierce, a youthful professional caddie
! from the Oakland Club at Adams Point.
I She consulted with him at times as to
I her play. Among those who followed her
! play intently throughout the match were
! Peter Martin. Baron yon Schroeder and
i Baron Alexis yon Schroeder. Mr. and
' Mrs. W. S. Hobart went over the first
I round. D. Drysdale scored for Miss Mof
| fltt and Miss Rowe. The other scorers,
one tor each pair of players, were: A.
B Ford, secretary Burlingame Country
Club; A. W. Blockie. F. S. Douty and M.
S. Wilson.
The course over which the links are
laid can be seen at different points from
I the road. Some spectators availed them
selves of this opportunity to see the play
from their fashionable equipages.

PERSONAL PROPERTY ASSESS
MENTS.
ASSESSOR DODGE has undertaken to effect
â  og like a revolution in assessing per
n :hi 5 city. From a list pub
lished - tefday showing the
made . ts of last -ear in the per
sonal pr â¢ iividuals. I
aggregate has been
5,056 for the last fiscal year to
- ,isjio for the pre;- .as adding in these
en cases a.one $.2,903,154 to the municipal
tax rolli.
It hzi long been known that throughout the
United States personal property has evaded to
a large extent the burdens of taxation. In the East
the evil has been even greater than on this coast. In
New York, Chicago and Boston the evasions long
since reached the extent of a public scandal, and va
rious legislative efforts have been made to remedy
them, but gen- .out avail. So strong, in fact,
has been the desire to escape such taxes that many
[thy men in Nt ive removed their domi
- to avoid them, and the advocates of impartial
tion have well nigh despaired of ever succeeding
rsonal property bear equally with realty
burdens of public revenue.
tat has been undertaken by Assessor Dndge may
therefore be assumed to be a step in the right direc
tion. T: â  -.".mption is confirmed by
the fact that in nearly every case the persons, firms
â  eluded in the list published in The
Cail have paid taxes upon the assessments fixed for
year, and have made no complaint of injustice.
- :: is fair to judge the whole, and it
:he increased assessments represent
accurately enough the true value of personal prop
erty as compared with that of real property.
The mc- -essments wiil of course entail no
higher or heavier burden of taxation for municipal
:â .=. they will enable the required revenues to
be raised, by a lower rate of taxation on the :
The only effect will be to place more of the burden
property and less upon real property
than in f kc!y. however, to lead to
n upon the city of a larger share than
ever of the burden of State taxation, unless the State
. liters can be relied upon to require an equal
fairness in the assessments of personal property in
nther counties The i^?t:e i? one of importance, for
ngf of personal property is rapidly be

INDEPENDENCE DÂ£3Y.
! I N yesterday's issue of one of our contemporaries, I
I after treating the usual method of celebrating the
the usual method of celebrating : c
* Fourth of July â - Asiatic, the followirig sentiments
I are expressed:
"When the celebration of the Fourth of July is so j
j raised in dignity that it may correspond to that j
! which heralds the birthday of the Queen or the name- j
i fetes of European Kings and Emperors, it will com
â  mand the good will of the people who really make j
Â» America what it is. But not till then." [
The Call has energetically opposed the imperialis
tic tendencies of the times, but never until yesterday
I has it found in an American newspaper the atrocious i
â  proposition that our national patriotism, uninspired ;
Iby the pomp of royalty, is common and unclean. It !
I denounces each syllable of the quotation as a- wanton
I insult to every American citizen in the land.
In the entire history of the world there is no paral
| lei for Independence Day. All nations have their fes
( tivals. ... centering in names, some in incidents, a j
I few in sentiments. But our national anniversary is ;
I fixed by the date of the first complete declaration of,
! human rights, of the sovereignty of man. There were i
1 great battles fought in the Revolutionary War. Bun- ]
| ker Hill, though a technical defeat, has never ceased j
[to influence the destiny of mankind. No battle, how- j
| ever, was chosen as the converging point of American :
patriotism. The end of hostilities with Great j
Britain, the treaty of peace, the articles of confedera- j
| tion, the adoption of the Federal constitution, the \
\ war of iÃi^, the war with Mexico, our Civil War. |
! have ail furnished opportunities for national -bra- â 
i tions which in Russia, in Germany, in France, even j
[ in Great Britain, in every country where the taint of j
; monarchy or imperialism remains, would have been j
: promptly appropriated.
But, in this vast continental republic, with its popu- ;
! lation of more than seventy-five millions and with its
i inimitable resources, our day of days continues to be j
! the selection of the revolutionary fathers. In each j
! year. now in the one hundred and twenty-third after j
i it was formulated, we concentrate our American sen- j
â  timer.t upon the Declaration of Independence, upon the j
; enunciation of the underlying principles upon which j
; cur national fabric has been erected The occasion j
whicti produced this eternal vindication of individual- j
1 ized manhood was merely the preamble to an act of
; the British ParliamenL But the document itself ab
: solutely struck the keynote for humanity. Emanating j
from thirteen feeble colonies, it was inspired by the j
1 hereditary and collateral strength of the human race.
It spoke for the Filipinos, then straggling with Spain, j
as it spoke for the colonists determined to thro oft I
the British yoke. It anticipated everything that was j
not a delusion or a curse in the French revolution. (
It reached human intelligence and the human con- j
science by the assertion of indestructible principles, !
applicable in all ages and to all races. It proclaimed :'
the inalienable right of every child of mortality, what- j
ever the color of his skin or the inferiority of his j
condition, to life, to liberty and to the pursuit of hap- j
piness. It acknowledged in every man the possession !
of sovereignty as an endowment derived from his ;
Creator. It Battened the ridiculous pretensions of j
blood and caste and raised the ordinary people ot the j
earth to the level of the only divine right that did not 1
originate in violence or in fraud.
In 1599, after all the experience of the past yeai inj
the midst of the shining glories of our naval and mili- ]
â tary* triumphs, notwithstanding all the perplexities 1
that the actual situation in Asia and in the Antilles I
reveal?, despite ail our far-reaching domestic contro
! versies that illustrate human imperfection, the Amer
ican people are still united in honoring*their certificate
of baptism, with all it expresses and implies. This ]
deep and pervading national sentiment, which no tern- !
porary conditions can extirpate or depress, will prove
to be the solvent of all our troubles. As an antidote j
to the inexplicable un- Americanism of the sentiments j
quoted in the first part of this article, it is refreshing
to observe that, in contradiction to all the departures |
from our national faith with which he has been falsely
charged, the Chief Magistrate of the republic retains
his patriotism in all its simplicity and in all its fervor.
In The Call of Sunday the greater part of a page was
devoted to the expressions of distinguished Ameri
cans in relation to this particular anniversary. The
words of President McKinley were memorable and
deserve to be handed down to posterity: "We have
arisen from slavery to freedom." * * * "Liberty,
labor and love have accomplished it all. * * * "All
men have equal rights." * * * "We are all Americans; i
we are all sovereigns, equal in the ballot, and that !
citizen is the best who does his best, who follows the
light as God gives him to see the light, who concedes
to all the races of -mankind what he claims for him
self."
These are the great thoughts of the man who,
through his political elevation, is now the first citizen ;
in the United States. They are cheering to the
American heart and chilling only to traitors and j
revolutionists. They will be consecrated to-day by
the festivities all over the continent, in every foreign
land and in every sea, that will mark the reign of \
manhood and prove that the American experiment of [
self-government was never further removed from the
possibility of a failure that would plunge the human '
race into black despair.
NO BLANKET TICKET.
REPORTS to the effect that the Republican
County Committee 15 considering the advisabil
â¢f preparing a blanket ticket for the entire
city at the approaching primary elections disclose the
fact that there is a possibility the committee may
commit a blunder at the outset which will seriously
compromise the campaign. It is safe to say that a
blanket ticket would be unsatisfactory to a great ma- !
jority of the party and would result in no advantage !
sufficient to counterbalance the dissatisfaction it
would give.
In arranging for the primaries every effort should
be made by the committee to get as close to the peo- â 
pie as possible. It is of course not expected that
there should be a separate ticket for each voting pre
cinct. That would entail too much expense and is not
necessary. There should be, however, a . separate
ticket for each Assembly District. Such tickets :
would not cost very much more than a blanket ticket
for the whole city, and would be in accord with the
desire of the voters.
This is a Republican year, and San Francisco is a
Republican city. Unless some blunder is made in the
management of the campaign or the nomination of
candidates the Republicans will carry the city, and the
government under the new charter will be organized
?:id inaugurated by a Republican administration.
Victory, ho-.vever. is not so well assured that the party
can afford to take riÂ«ks. Nothing must be done that
is likely to cause offense or to give dissatisfaction to
the voters, upon whom the candidates of the party
must rely for success.
The Call has already pointed out that the Demo
crats have been unusually active thus early in the year
in preparing for the contest. Phelanites, Raineyites,
Euckleyites and all the other factions have been busy
organizing clubs and rallying their followers for the
i struggle to control the party nominations. These
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JI'LY 4, 1599.
- wfl] he active workers in the campaign from
start to 61 c Republican managers must be
active sn their tt:rn and careful as well as active. Any
" 'position as that of a blanket ticket for
the city should be ;â¢ :. once. The adoption of
se h a method of voting st the primaries would be
"raw politics" of the worst kind.

AN INDORSEMENT FOR H^VEMEYER.
RARELY in the annals of American politics have
the statements of a man having any reputation
at ai! been so completely refuted, ridded an ]
ridiculed as those of Mr. Havemeyer, to the effect
that the present tariff is four-fifths extortion and the
parent of trust?. In such a situation Mr. Havemeyer
has doubtless been turning in every direction looking
for an indorsement of some kind from some quarter,
â¢-. i'.iir.g to accept it in whatever shape it should
come.
The loose-talking New Yorker may now comfort
himself a littl< for he has found a friend of just as
much loquacity and just as little sense. That con
genial indorser lives in this city and has sent the in
dorsement to the Nebraska City Conservative, in
which paper it has been duly published without com
ment. It rur.s â¢
%V-;: = . Fargo & Co., Office of President,
San Francisco. Cai., June 15. 1599.
Dear Mr. Morton: Preferring to yours of June 7.
doubtless you noticed Havemeyer's testimony be
fore the Washington commission yesterday and his
remarks upon the matter of trusts, namely, that
the protective tariff is the mother of trusts in the
United Ftates of America. I am with him every
time on that statement. I think his observations In
general were based on facts and good sense. Very
truly yours. JOHN J. VALENTINE.
A draft upon human credulity drawn by Havemeyer
and indorsed by Valentine is certainly a unique docu
ment even in the politics of a country where the
canard and the roorback are common. Fortunately
the names of the parties are so well known and the
reputation of each so well established that no one is
likely to be deceived by the document. The only ef
fect of the Valentine indorsement will be to confirm
the judgment of the public formed on the original
statement. The main interest in the matter lies in
the new evidence it gives of Valentine's craving for
notoriety. Wherever there is an opening in a news
paper, on a platform or in a pulpit, he is there to
show that he can shed language as readily as he shirks
taxes or cinches the public, and seemingly there is no
form of iniquity he is not willing to uphold either by
precept or practice.
In a recent wild debauch that lacked nothing in
spectacular effect except "knockout drops." United
States Consul J. C. McCook invited everybody to
kick him, an amusement which he thoroughly en
joyed. In exonerating him from the consequences of
his offense the national authorities appear to have
overlooked his request. A kick which would have
landed him out of office would have been well placed.
The name of Assessor Dodge will probably be
found in the profit and loss account of a good many
local merchants. Or perhaps some of them would pre
fer to consider him an unsecured liability.
â¢ â¢
The local taxpayer whose personal property assess
ment was raised from Sioo to $25,000 probably doesn't
feel as cheap as he used to be.
Latest fashion advices from Europe are to the effect
that in Belgium and Italy royal crowns are no longer
worn straight.
Mataafa is complaining that he is the victim of a
broken promise. He is lucky it wasn't his head.

yesterday. Since her arrival here on June
TO she has been thoroughly overhauled
and is now as stanch as the day she was
launched. Owing to the fact that the
company's steamer Zealandla was re
tained by the Government as a transport
there was no vessel to relieve the Aus
tralia en the Honolulu run so the repairs
had to be made in a {riven lime. In con

The steamer Gold has been taken off the
Petaluma run lor an overhauling, and the
steamer Grace Barton will take her place.
The Gold will be laid up about three
weeks, and during that time she will |
have new boilers put in and her machin
ery fixed up. When ready for business
again she will be as good as new.
J. R. Hanify & Co. have added a new
steamer to their coasting fleet. She is 160
feet long. 34 feet broad and 12 feet 6
inches deep, bne was built by J. Lind
strom of Grays Harbor and will be en
gined by the Fulton Iron Works. The
new vessel has been named the San Pedro,
and will be placed on the run between Eu
reka and southern ports when: completed.
The San Pedro was towed down part of \
the way from Grays Harbor to San Fran
cisco by the steamer -Coquille River. |
When loaded with 600,000 feet of lumber
the steamer took her out of Grays Harbor
and started down the coast with her.
Friday night a strong breeze came up and '
the OoQUille River and the San Pedro
parted company. The latter vessel is
schooner rigged, and it did not take her
crew long to get all sail on. She outran
the Coquiile Kiver, and the two did not
see each other again until Point Arena
was reached. There was then a head
breeze and the captain of the Sac Pedro
was glad to get the Coquille River's haw
ser aboard again. Hanify & Co. are now
running the steamers South Coast, Scotia
and Samoa, and by the end of the month
the San Pedro will be added to the list.
A number of changes among captains of
steamers have taken place. â¢ The Mail
Company will turn the City of Para over
to the Government in a few days, and
Chief Officer Robinson of the Rio de
Janeiro will command her. Captain Zee
der of the City of Para is going to Europe
for a vacation. Captain Bruguiere of the
wrecked steamer Starbuck, who has been
I without a command since the accident,
has been offered the position of chief offi
! cer of the Rio de Janeiro.
Captain Broomhead of the Conemaugh
went out as master of the Pennsylvania,
and Captain Roberts, who came here from
the East, is now in command of the Con
emaugh. Captain Doxrud of the Penn
sylvania Is to take command of the
steamer- Rhineland on the Atlantic.
The new four-masted schooner James
Rolph is to be launched from Bendixson's
Yards at Eureka to-morrow night. James
â Rolj'h Jr. and a party of friends went up
to Humboldt Bay on the steamer Pomona
yesterday and will witness the launching.
The vessel will be christened by Miss A.
! Reid of San Francisco and will go Into
i commission at once. She will be added
\ to the growing fleet of Hind. Rolph & Co.
The transport Tacoma arrived from Ma
i nila yesterday after a long passas<s of ,
seventy days, due to light winds and
calms. There were days when the ship
did not make a knot an hour, and others
when she actually lost ground. it is o\er
a year since the Tacoma was on the arj
dock nd that also helped to retard her.

UP BY THE ASSESSOR
Thirty=four Million Dollars Are
Added to the Roll.
If the Supervisors Keep Their Pledge the Tax Rate
May Not Exceed Ninety Cents An Enormous
Increase of Corporation Values.
IF the Supervisors honor their
pledge to tax the people of the city
$1 on every $PX>. on an assessed
raluatloo of $350,000,000 the tax
rate this year will not be greater
than P0 cents, and it may be less.
Assessor Dodge has finished his real
estate and personal property rolls
ami the total assessment is $356.051,172,
an iner ;aseof $34,267,078 over the assess
ment nf last year. This increase, on a
dollar limit basis, reduces, as a matter
of course, the rate of taxation. This
rate cannot be more than 90, cents on
this basis and for certain reasons it
be less.
Assessor Dodge has received from At- |
torney General Ford an opinion which i
Is not an opinion in reference to the le
gality of taxing quasi public and cor- ,
ration bonds. The Attorney General
says that he does not know whether or ;
not such bonds may be taxed but he
recommends all Assessors to tax them i
and have the mooted question decided j
by the courts. Assessor Dodge intends
to adopt the suggestion and in doing so
â will add $21,000,000 to the personal prop
erty roll. This will make the grand j
total $407,746,000, and will reduce the
assessment rate on a dollar limit on an
assessed valuation of $350,000,000 to 85
cents, the lowest rate ever suggested
or proposed in the history of San Fran
cisco.
If the Supervisors provide for a de
ficiency of 130,000 and appropriate $125,
--.COO for St. Mary's Park, the rate on an
assessed valuation of $356,000,000 will be
$0,973. The rate, under the same condi
tions, on an assessed valuation of $407,
--740,000 will be $0,923. The people of the
city are assured therefore in any con
tingency of a very low rate of taxation,
particularly in comparison with that of
last year, which was $1,318 on an as
sessed valuation- of $352,000,000.
Assessor Dodge has made his re- .
markable increase in the total assessed
valuation of local property without in
juring the small taxpayer. On the con
trary, he has greatly benefited the
thousands of small real estate holders
by reducing their rate of taxation over
40 cents on the $100 without raising
the assessed valuation of their prop
erty. The corporations, banks and
large individual owners of personal
property will stand the enormous in
crease in this year's levy. A comparison
of startling and Important figures will
illustrate this fact The total assess
ment for this year on real estate is
$280,465,717, against $283,088,984 for the
last fiscal year. Th" increase in real
estate values is therefore only $2,376,
--733, which, divided among thousands of
taxpayers, becomes a burden of com
paratively small Importance. The total
personal property assessment for this
year is $100,585,465, including the ?21,
--000,000 which the Assesor now intends
to add In bonds.. The total personal
property assessment of last year was
15,110, making the increase for this
year in personal property $31,890,345.
Of this enormous increase the cor
porations must bear $18,100,000, and in
dividual taxpayers and banks $18,260,
--000. The assessments of the corpora
tions have been increased from $20,390,
--000 in 1898 to $38,500,000 this year. The
assessment of the Market Street Rail
way Company has been increased over
JS, 000.000. The Spring Valley Water
Company must stand a raise of more
than $4,000,000. The San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company assessment is
advanced $1,900,000. The Pacific Gas
Improvement Company Is increased
more than $1,300,000.
The changes are startling, as will be
seen from the following comparative
table of leading taxpayers:

Most of the heavy owners of personal
property have already paid their taxes
for this year, at the rate of last year,
which was $1,318. If the rate is reduced
therefore, as it unquestionably will be,
all of these taxpayers will receive a re
bate. Just what this rebate will be is
now necessarily a matter of conjecture.
In the first place the Supervisors may
reduce the values fixed by the Assessor.
The .tax upon national bank stocks,
valued at $7,500,000, may be eliminated.
There may be a further reduction of as
sessed values of 500,000, to cover un
collected taxes, making a total loss of
$13,000,000, and a reduction of the total
assessment to $373,000,000.
Upon such an assessed valuation,
with a tax of $1 on every $100. the rate
would be 94 cents. It is difficult to de
termine, therefore, what the rebate will
be. and those property owners that
have paid their personal property tax
will have to wait for what is due them.
A fact in this connection is Interesting.
While the personal property roll has
been increased enormously, the individ
ual taxpayers will not have to pay
: ore this year than they did last year,
as th" lite of taxation has boen de
creased proportionately as much, if not
more, than the assessed valuation has
been increased. The real estate tax
payers, as already shown, will pay very
much lees, as the assessed valuation of
their property has not been Increased
materially.
There may still be further relief to
the taxpayers by assessing and taxing
.bonds. The Assessor is determined to
do this, and although he has turned his
assessment rolls over to the Supervis
ors, he will nevertheless make an addi
tion of $21,000,000 represented in the as
sessment as bonds.
Attorney General Ford'B opinion in
this niauer has thus become an issue
of grave importance. The opinion
was rendered yesterday to Hon.
All". Brown, chairman of the State
Board of Equalization. It will serve
hs a guide to every county Assessor in
the State, as well as to the equalizers
fixing the rate of taxation for the main
tenance of the State.
There Is one class of bonds, that of
railroads and other quasi puullo cor
porations, which caused some >ioubt In
the minds of Mr. Ford and Mr. Abbott.
While personally they believe that such
are subject to taxation, *!ill there are
decisions by the Supreme Court which
leave the question open to doubt. The
opinion -was given in response to the
following inquiry by Mr. Brown:
The State Beard of Equalization would
like your opinion as to what bonds are j
aÂ«s^ssahle under the provisions of section .
1. article XIII of the constitution of this
PtHt^. Specifically, the board wishes i<>
bo advised as to the assessability of bonds
of the State of California, of the counties
and municipalities thereof, of the smaller
districts, such as school districts, therein, â 
the bonds of railroad companies, such as
the Southern Pacific, the San Francisco
and San Joaquin Valley and other like
corporations, the bonds of tin- Market
Street Railway in San Francisco, the
Spring Valley Water Works Company,
gas and electric light companies and ail
other private, quasi public and public cor. ',
porations, except the bonds Issued by the!
GovÂ« rnment of the United States under an
a' t of Congress, when such bonds are held
by private persona and corporations.
To this the State's Attorneys answer: i
In reply will state that the sovereign
power of the Siaie to tax all property
within the State cannot be quest!
The constitution of this State, in arti
cle XIII, section 1. has provided thai ail
rty in this .Slate, not exempt un
der tht laws of the United States, shall
!'Â«â  taxed in proportion to it? value to
:â¢â  as â¢ rtained as provided by law, and
enumerates money, credits, bonds,
stocks, dues, franchises, etc., as within
the meaning of the word "property;"
this section also provides lor certain
t xemptions.
The exemptions noted are young
orchards and vineyards, growing crops,
free libraries, etc., and all sucks,
bonds, treasury notes and otht-r obli
gations of the Tnited States. As to the
-ability of the bonds of the State
of California, it has been held that the
same are personal property within the
meaning of the revenue laws of this
State. Bunds of counties and munici
palities also have been held to be per
sonal property and likewise are liable
to taxation as such.
The assessability of bonds of railroad
companies, etc., proved a stickler for
the attorneys. Under the State consti
tution all property in this State, not
exempt under the laws of the United
States, shall be taxed, "and the word
â property' as used in this article and
section (Art. XIII. Sec. 1) is hereby de
i clared to include moneys, credits,
j bonds, stocks, dues, franchises and all
j other matters and things, real, per
sonal and mixed, capable of private
; ownership." â¢ * â¢
Section 3617 of the Political Code
{ seems to exempt railroad bonds, for
it says:
"Whenever the terms mentioned in
this section are employed in this act
they are employed in the sense herein
! after affixed to them: First. The term
! 'property' includes moneys, credits,
bonds (except of railroad or quasi
public corporations), stocks, dues,
franchises and all other matters and
! things, real, personal and mixed, cap
| able of private, ownership."
According to article XI, section 13,
of the State Constitution of 1863 there
does not seem to be any exemption..
In dealing with the proposition of as
sessing railroad bonds it would seem,
according to the opinion, that lawyers,
Legislature and court are at sea upon
! the question. The Political Code ex
empts these securities and this was
recognized by the Supreme Court in
| the case of Maekay vs. San Francisco,
i wherein it was claimed that the taxa
j tion of the bonds of a railroad was ille
| gal for the reason that the code ex
] pressly exempted them. Upon this the
I opinion says:
The only possible objection that might
' be urged against the taxing of the bond 3
I of railroads and other quasi public cor
i porations i.= that it would be "double tax
ation," and therefore prohibited by the
( m.-titution and law of this State. â¢ â¢ â¢
Were it not for the decisions of the Su
preme Court of this State last above re
ferred to in relation to double taxation, I
should unhesitatingly say that the bonds
i of railroads and other quasi public cor
porations are subject to taxation In the
: same manner as is other personal prop
ertj in this State. The precise question,
1 however, has never been directly decided
| by the Supreme Court of this State, and,
as you can readily see, the matter is not
wholly free from doubt. I would there
fur*- advise that all bonds of this char
acter be assessed by the respective As
sessors of the several counties, and if
1 Â«uch assessment be contested the matter
can then be speedily tested in the courts
j and definitely settled. Very truly yours,
TIRKY la. FORD, Attorney General.
By WILLIAM M. ABBOTT,
Deputy Attorney General.
Bonds similar to those discussed by
i the Attorney General are assessed in
! other States, and Assessor Dodge be
lieves they should be taxed in this
! State. In speaking generally yesterday
of his assessment and its meaning he
said:
"I hope the taxpayers of this city will
see that the way to secure low taxes
and a low rate Ik honestly to return
their property to the Assessor. If this
; were done a dollar rate in a few years
would be regarded as exorbitant as a
rate of $1 31 Is now. This city, unlike
any other city in the United States of
over 100,000 population, has no bonded
â  debt to provide a sinking fund for
i through yearly taxation. Think of
; Chicago, with 66 cents in each tax levy
â¢ for sinking fund and interest on levy
i alone; Philadelphia with 71 cents, Bos-
I ton with 41 cents, Cincinnati with 51
cents, and other Eastern cities in much
the same condition.
"Why should we not have the lowest
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 4, 1599.
tax rate in our enviable position of any
city in the United States? We certainly
should. I would be willing to guaran
tee that in three years I could reduco
the tax rate of this city under the new
charter to 70 cents on the $100 and not
raise to any extent the valuation of
real estate.
"As to my assessments of the large
corporations. I am prepared to show
that while they are largely increased
they are not unjust .or burdensome, and
that in the past many of these corpora
tions have had their property outra
geously undervalued."
Since Assessor Dodge has turned over
his books to the Supervisors the board
has adopted a resolution to the effect
that having met and examined the as
sessment books of real and personal
property for the fiscal year 1899. it will
hereafter be in session until Monday,
July 17, for the purpose of hearing ap
plications for the correction of assess
ments.

TO MEET THE REGENTS
OPINIONS REGARDING HIS RE
CENT LETTER TO THE BOARD.
Belief That He Will Accept the Presi
dency of the Universityâ The
Syle Episode.
Professor Benjamin Ide Wheeler of Cor
nell, president-elect of the University of
California, has accepted the invitation of
the Bonrd of Regents to come here and
study the situation at Berkeley. He will
leave Ithaca for the West this week. Re
gents who voted for Professor Wheeler,
and they comprise a majority of the
bnar.l are of the opinion that he will ac
cept the presidency of the institution.
They ere rot pleased, however, with the
tone of his lettter demanding certain con
ditions. His reference to the promotion of
L. Dv Pont Syle from assistant to asso
ciate professor is regarded as ill-timed
and unfortunate. The regents are will
ing to confess that the judgment of the
board in this promotion was influenced, in
some d< gret=>, by importunity, but they do

(From His Latest Photo.)
n.n admit that the presldent-el*et has any
rferhr to call the board to account. He
should hold his peace, they think, until
his own recommendations are set aside.
Some of the regents admire the blunt
frankness of Mr. Wheeler in demanding |
in advance that his work of reorganizing ]
the faculty should not be impeded by the
board On the other hand, the declara
tion is freely made by several regents who
voted for him that they would not have
Â«o voted if the letter presented at the
last meeting had been before them when
the election took place.
Recent Arthur Rodgers declares that
outspoken manliness is one of the chief
attributes of the president-elect, and the
blunt frankness which surprises other "re
gents rrally gratifies the ardent supporter
of the Cornell professor.
Harper's Weekly of July 1 has the fol
lowing complimentary notice of Professor
Wheeler: __ , .
"Professor T'.enjamln Ide Wheeler of
Cornell the distinguished educator whom
bo many colleges have proposed to. has
been elected president of the University
of California, and it is taken for granted
that he will accept that office. Dr.
Vheeler went to California last winter,
looked over the university and apparently
discussed t^rms with the regents, since
with the new?, of his election there comes
word that his salary is to be $10,000 a year.
That is a more suitable remuneration than
moet of the presidents of our foremost
colleges receive, but Dr. Wheeler is pen
erally recognized as one of the most valu
able "men in his line of business. The
chemical flavor of his name alone is worth
a good deal to a college. He has an ex
perience in athletics which is also valu
able and his personal qualities as well as
his scholarly attributes seem to qualify
him in a very unusual degree to be the
head of a university. It is a good thlnÂ«
not only for him but for the whole peda
gogical "profession that such a man should
receive fairly liberal pay, for the fact that
fit pr- t;ent the financial prizes in the pro
fession of teaching are not big enough
must tend to keep out of that calling some
able men whose tastes and abilities in
cline them toward it.
"The East will be sorry to lose Dr.
Wheeler, and no doubt Cornell will mlsa
him sadly; but his settlement at the head
of a great institution will have a compos
ing effect on the minds of all trustees of
colleges who are looking about for a
leader."

SUPERVISORS BLOCK
THE FRANCHISE STEAL
Grant Avenue Loop Will Not Be
Awarded to the Railroad.
Seven Votes Save the City From the Big Raid of the
Monopoly â An Indefinite Postponement Secured
After a Stubborn Fight.
TITK Board of Supervisors will not
offer for sale franchises 'in Grant
avenue, Stockton, Battery ami
an streets. The Market j
Street Railroad Company haw
lo.ct that part of its projected steal
which was involved in the disposition
of these privileges. The Supervisors
ed yesterday by a vote of seven
â¢ â¢ to postpone indefinitely all fur
ther consideration of The franchises. ;
This fettles the matter once for all.
The board adopted finally the cork
screw franchise and thus insures to
the people of the city this important
cropstown railroad.
The other fou tions were not
without a stubborn battle,
i:: which the railroad people received
valuable but va >rt. When the j
1 of the Street Committee was
it was found that Supervisors
tinker, Attridg ; '.land had
i a recommendation of the four
franchises. Supervisors Kalben and
Collins, who arc members of the eom
refused to sic;n the report.
When the report had been read Super
visor D ai I that all reference
ses -" I out, as he w;i*
Informed that the committee had made
ition at its meeting- on â 
Thursday.
The motion was immediately sec
onded and then Supervisor Aigeltinger :
arose to make a curious explanation, j
Imitted that the Street Committee:
had taken no definite action on Thurs
day, but had met yesterday morning
and made the recommendations in
â¢ -port. "All we did this ;
for," he said, "was to get the matter
out of the way." After an uninteresting
skirmish the board suspended its rules j
to hear what representatives of the
Merchants' Association, improvement
clubs and citizens unattached had to j
say in reference to the franchises. At
the same time Supervisor AigeHinprer
presented an elaborately prepared reso
lution offering the franchises for sale
and authorizing an advertisement for
Then the old. time-worn, ha-ckneyed
discussion followed. A. S. Baldwin
consumed considerable valuable time
in repeating what he had said better
before. The only new thought that his
anything but fertile brain suggested
SEEKING TO UNDO
A " BLUNDER OF
THE LEGISLATURE
A Bill Signed That Did
Not Pass.
IMPORTANT WORK CHECKED
COMMISSION OF PUBLIC WORKS
LAPSED BY MISTAKE.
The Question of Relieving a State
Misfortune Now Placed in the
Sands of the Supreme
Tribunal.
The Supreme Court heard in bank j
yesterday afternoon the writ of man- ;
date recently granted to Ed E. Leake '
directing the State Controller to ap
pear and show cause why he should i
not pay petitioner a salary as Oommis- !
sioner of Publk- Works for the month
of March.
Juflso Beatty explained that the writ
had been granted on account of the im- \
portanee of the Interests involved and i
the urgency for a speedy determination :
of i ho issues raised, and a delay would i
seriously hamper an important Si
work and impair the efficiency of im- j
portant work already accomplished.
Attorney General Ford and Deputy
Abbot: appeared for the respondent,!
and J. < '. Brusie represented the pe
titioner.
All counsel agreed that the act of
- null and void for ilk- reason that
the Governor signed a bill that did not
pass the Legislature. A remark made
by Justice Van Dyke left the inference
that the court holds th<* same view.
Mr. Ford contended that by the pro
visions of the act of isTi* the oflice of j
Commissioner of Public Works expired
by limitation on -March 1, I>fi9. He
contended that in amending the act of
1593 and providing that the office shall
cense to exist ai ted time it is not i
necessary that the purpose of such
amendment be stated in the title. j
Mr. Ford expressed sincere rocrret |
for the blunder of the Legislature,
which he claimed has resulted in stop- i
I i work of great importance to the
State, and the beneficial effects of
â which are so apparent that nobody de- ;
ni"s thai it is a public calamity that j
the office has been allowed to lapse.
Mr. Brusie, for the petitioner, con-]
Tended that the second section of the
net of ISST if=- a rider added to the orip- ;
nal bill for the purpose (.f repealing it '
and is therefore invalid, for The reason \
that this purpose is not expressed in ;
the title. In support of this contention
he quoted many decisions rendered in !
various States by the courts of last
resort. One of these decisions was !
written by chief Justice Beatty of this
State.
Mr. Brusie also called attention to j
what is known as the Auditing- Board
act. This was passed several weeks [
after the act of 1897. It prescribes the !
duties of the members of the Audit ins:
Board, all of which are contingent upon j
the existence of the office of Commis- I
sioner of Public Works. Every line of I .
this art implies the existence of such
office, and it continues the Auditing
Board indefinitely.
The last clause provides for the re- j j
peal of all acts and parts of acts in con- i
fiict with it. Ab section 2 of the act of i
was the feeble expression of a suspicion '
that the newspapers are very wicked
affairs generaJly and should not oppose
the Grant avenue loop. Mr. Baldwin j
was followed by the Rev. Father Otis,
who wanted to see the Grant avenue .
loop franchise sold as a road upon the
thoroughfare will be a convenience to â 
the people that attend St. Mary's
Church. Edgar Painter also chirped
daintily in pdvocacy of. the proposed
raid and H. Peterson ended the sym- !
posium.
Supervisor Aigeltinger then moved
that the franchises be considered by
the board. Byington immediately :
amended to refer the franchises again
t-> the Street Committee, to remain in
the committee until the Market Street
Railroad Company agreed to abide by ;
the provisions of the charter to lay un
derground wires and to use Berlin
rails. The amendment was lost by the ;
following vote: Ayes â Byington, Col- i
11ns, Deasy, Heyer, Lackmann and Per- j
rault; noes â Aigeltinger, Attrldge, j
Black, Holland, Kalben and Phelps. A
vote was then taken on Algeltinger's
motion, which was also lost by the fol- I
lowing vote: Ayes â Aigeltinger, At
tridge. Black, Holland, Kalben and
Phelps; noesâ Byington, Collins. |
Deasy, Heyer, Lackmann and Per
rault. |
This simply meant that the board re- i
fused to consider the franchises out of j
the regular order of business.. The j
lobby disappeared and the board pro
ceeded with the routine of the day.
After all other business had been
transacted the franchise question was
forgotten. Supervisor Lackmann re
called it to the attention of his asso
ciates and Aigeltinger's resolution of
fering the four franchises for sale was
read. Supervisor Lackmann imme- !
diately moved that all further consid
eration of the matter be indefinitely
postponed. This motion, which killed
the franchises and saved the city from {
the raid of the monopoly, was adopted |
by the following vote:
Ayes â Supervisors Byington, Col
lins, Deasy, Heyer, Kalben, Lack
mann and Perrault â 7.
Noes â Supervisors Aig-eltinger, At
tridge, Black, Phelps and Holland â 5.
1R97 is clearly in conflict with the act
creating the Auditing Board, Mr. Bru
mtended that said Beetion, even if
it were valid when enacted, was re
pealed by the Auditing Board act sub
ently passed.
Upon the conclusion of the argument
Justice Benny directed counsel t.> file
a list of authorities and declared that
the court would render an early deci
sion.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., TUESDAY, JULY 4, 189:>.
PHELAN SHIES AT
THE DOLLAR LIMIT
An Innocent Resolution Causes the
Mayor Much Embarrassment.
Finance Committee Asks Him to Make Good Bis Asser
tions That Such a Tax Levy Is Sufficient
for the City's Needs.
MAYOR PHEL-AN does not seem to |
be as deeply infatuated with the. j
dollar limit as he was during the j
campaign last fall. Then, from a j
dozen platforms each night, he j
assured the voters of San Francisco that -
1 with a careful pruning of the expendi
tures, Including a thorough weeding out
i of superfluous deputies in the various de- j
'â  partmer.ts of the municipal government,
â  a dollar limit on an assessed valuation of i
$350,000,000 would provide ample revenue.
The Mayor made the dollar limit his
hobby, and rode it early and late to every
assemblage of the faithful between North
Beach and the county line. It was the
â  panacea for all municipal ills.
i Even before the campaign opened or the
municipal conventions had met, Mayor
Phelan had trumpeted the dollar limit so
loud and so persistently that friends and
opponents listened to his siren blasts with
the result that the Supervisorial nominees
of every convention were rigidly pledged
to the dollar limit.
Now, his Honor is asking himself why
he talked so much.
For the first time during his political ca
reer Mayor Phelan was brought face to
face with the dollar limit at the session of
the Board of Supervisors yesterday after
noon. Dr. Perrault performing the intro
duction ceremony, and if facial expres
sions indicate anything, the Mayor did
, not relish the meeting in the least. A
dose of the doctor's own nostrums might
be expected to produce about the same
grimace.
The trouble arose over an innocent ap
pearing little resolution recommended by
the Finance Committee, which recited
that the tax levy would not be fixed until
September, and in order that the Auditor
might have something to guide him in
passing upon the city's accounts every
public officer and department was limited
to one-sixth of the actual amount esti
mated for the maintenance of the various
offices and departments under the esti
mate of the committee fixing the tax rate
at $1,073. Accompanying the resolution
and made a part thereto was the estimate
as published exclusively in The Call last
Friday.
Mayor Pholan innocently asked if the
departments could be maintained under
that limit.
"It will make big cuts in all the depart
ments." replied Supervisor Perrault, who
as chairman of the Finance Committee ;
acted as spokesman.
"But some of the officials have told mo
they cannot keep their offices open," said
the Mayor.
"Well, 1 expect it will hurt some of
them, but we have done the best we
could. You know we are all pledged to
the dollar limit, which your Honor has
repeatedly asserted is quite sufficient to
run the government on."
"Are all the departments affected?
What is the basis for the County Clerk's
office?"
"We have held that down in accordance
with the recent decision of the Supreme
Court. Every office is cut with the excep
tion of the License office. We left the
; appropriation for the ensuing six months
the same as it was last year out of con
sideration to your Honor, as we under
: stood you had five appointees in that of
fice, and we did not are to disturb
them."
"Did Mr. Bonnet say that he could not
get along with a smaller force?"
"Yes, last January, if you remember, I
called on Mr. Bonnet and he assured me
that his office was conducted as econom
ically as it could be. 1 have also talked
with Mr. Lees, the present Collector, and
he said the same thing. If his force was i
reduced, he said, he would suffer serious j
inconvenience. When I was talking to
him I tried to get an appointment in his
office for your Honor, but he wouldn't
stand for that."
"Who asked you to get an appointment
for me?"
"Oh, it was Mr. Fay, your private sec
retary." As Mr. Fay is in the Mayor's
private oflice and Is regarded as one of
his closest political lieutenants everybody
in the chamber but the Mayor enjoyed the
sally hugely.
â  Here Supervisor Aigeltinger broke in
with the statement that the Street De
partment could not be maintained on the
limit allowed by the Finance Committee,
and asked that it be increased.
Byington sought to rescue the Mayor
by moving that the resolution lie over for
a week. â  : *
Holland opposed the motion. He said the
Auditor must have some basis to work on
and the resolution should be adopted,
even If it was found necessary to amend
it in a week or two.
Perrauli again donned the gloves, so to
speak, and asked the Mayor to suggest
such clerkH as could be lopped off with
out crippling the department to which
they were attached. "If your Honor will
remember," said the doctor, "you stated
in your annual message that a great sav
ing could be effected by dispensing with
the extra deputies. One of the newspa
pers has stated that your Honor has ex
pressed a willingness to confer with the
Finance Committee. Certainly we shall
be glad to accept your advice in this mat
ter, for while we have no desire to crip
ple any department, still we are bound to
the dollar limit, and as your Honor is a
stanch advocate of that tax rate and with
your greater experience you can without
a doubt give us the desired information a*
to keeping within the limit without work
ing a hardship on any of the departments.
As it is now, we have some prisoners in
the County Jail and some patients in the
County Hospital, as well as some Inmates
of the Almshouse, all of whom will have
to reduce their appetites to correspond
to the dollar limit; those people will prob
ably not get as much to. eat as they do
now, but this board is pledged to keep
within the dollar limit and we are deter
mined to keep within our pledge."
"Are all of those Institutions affected
by this estimate?" asked the Mayor.
"Yes, all of them. The Almshouse, for
instance, is shaved $15,000, and you know
$15,000 buys considerable food. However,
if your Honor will give the Finance Com
mittee the benefit of your experience and
judgment, perhaps we can make a more
satisfactory adjustment of this matter."
"I am entirely willing to confer with the
committee," said the Mayor.
"Meanwhile," continued Perrault. "the
Merchants' Association will probably sub
mit a tax levy in the course of a couple
of weeks, and if we delay action until
then it may give us something to work
on."
Lackmann objected to any delay. "We
must give the Auditor. some estimate to
work on." he said, "even if we upset it
next week."
Phelps said the Auditor would not pass
upon any bills contracted during- the cur
rent fiscal year for a week or two, conse
quently there would be no harm in delay,
but a majority of the members thought
differently, and the motion to postpone
was lost by a vote of 8 to 4. .
The Tf solution then came up for adop
tion and was carried by a vote of 9 to 3,
and the heads of the various departments
must conduct their offices under the dol
lar limit for the time- being at least.
Perrault again paid his respects to the
Mayor by asking when his Honor would
be willing to counsel with the Finance
Committee.
"Oh, any time will do," replied the
Mayor: /'there's no hurry about that." ,'
'"I think differently." returned Per
rault. "There seems to be need for con
siderable hurry. Of course, the commit
tee is entirely -at your service, and any
time you may select will be quite satis
factory to us." .".-'
"Well, some time within the next two
weeks will do." answered Mayor Phelan,
who seemed to find relief in calling up
the order of business.
It is understood that when Mayor Phe
lan confers with the | Finance Committee
,*!! the improvement Clubi in |hÂ§ city,
â which are greatly agitated over the ' a ""
are to make any provision for street ana j
other improvements, will demand a hear-
Ing. They will remind the Mayor of his
repeated promises to them that they
should be amply provided for in the way
of Improvements, and will demand of the
Mayor if the elimination of every projected j
Improvement in addition to crippling the
Street Department to such an extent that
not even ordinary repairs can be made is
the proper way to take care of them.
THE BLACK DEATH.
Explanation of Conditions Aboard
the Nippon Maru.
To the Editor of the San Franoisen Call: In
view of the many Inaccuracies which have ap
peared in the San Francisco daily press on the
subject of the Nippon Muru we beg to fur
nish j-ou with the simple statement of facts.
We must not dispute the statement th.it the
case of the Chinese boy who died at Nagasaki
on May 26 was one of plague, for we were not
permitted to see any of the specimens upon
which the diagnosis of plague was made by the
Japanese authorities. After his death the ship
was thoroughly disinfected by the quarantine
officials of Nagasaki and all paesengers. saloon
included, were taken to the quarantine station
and bathed and their clothes were "fumigated.
After a week's quarantine, terminating June
S, the ship sailed with a clean bill of health,
and after a thorough Investigation at Kobe
and Yokohama we cleared from Yokohama for
Honolulu and San Francisco June 8.
A I'hinese steerage passenger died on board
on Jun^ H and the bo-ly was embalmed, and
on arrival at Honolulu on June 17 the authori
ties there made a post mortem examination of
the remains. After twenty-four hours they re
ported that they had "found bacilli resembling
those of bubonic plague." The port physician
did not tell us It was plague, but said repeat
edly thut the bacilli resembled those of plague.
We were immediately put Into quarantine and
remained under strict quarantine rules for four
days.
At the request of Captain Allen, and on the
recommendation of the port physician, we
were invited to form a committee with the
ship's surgeon for the purp< se of thoroughly
fumigating the ship under the direction of the
quarantine officerâ the Board of Health sup
plied the material, namely, formaldehyde and
sulphurâ and under our personal supervision
these were applied vigorously. To insure the
proper tarrying out of our orders we four tc>"k
regular three-hour watches, day and night.
Kach steerage passenger w;is bathed in a cai
bolic aciii bath, the clothing worn disinfected
with steam under pressure anil a new. disin
fected suit given to each person on coming <>ut
of the tath. The baggage of all steera^'- pas-
M-ngers ana t!n-ir Quarters were thoroughly
fumigated with sulphur and afterward witn
formaldehyde. During these days guards were
stationed to Insure there was no communication
between steerage and saloon, and on every oc
casion after being in contact with the steerage
our elothlng was disinfected before returning
to our quarters. On June 20, having transferred
the Honolulu passengers under quarantine to
ihe steamer chartered for them by the com
pany, we sailed for San Francisco.
On Monday. June 19, a Japanese woman, 29
>.; rs of age and mother ot two children, was
sfrii-ken with paralysis.. Phe was seen by
two of us il'rs. Hall and Scott) that evening
at different times, and we concurred in the
diagnosis made. The following morning T>r.
I 'ay, the port physician of Honolulu, saw the
woman and agreed with us that It was paralv
sls. but due to apoplexy, probably of specific
origin; he said there was no evidence nf
plague and that he would 'give us a- certificate
which would be satisfactory to the authori
ties at San Francisco. He did so and we read
it and considered It quite satisfactory. It is
unnecessary to add that even a layman could
not possibly mistake apoplexy for plague. We.
along with the ship's surpeon. paid her several
visits, ar.'i on every occasion her temperature
and riils* were iv.rmal and we saw n..thttiÂ«
which made us change our opinion of her â :i<^.
The reason given us by Dr, Day for not tak
ing her off the Nippon Mnni was that the
movintc mipht cause her death: and the Attor
ney General of Hawaii said that in that case
he would be liable to be charged with man
slaughter. She lingered, as all such cases
usually do. in a more or less unconscious con
dition until June 25. when she died.
Captain Allen, feeling .secure by reason of the
certificate from Dr. Day, and the independent
opinion of the medical committee, decided to
bury at sea, this being the rule of the com
pany In ra?" of the death of a Japanese steer
age passenger. The engines were stopped and
a portion of the burial services having been
read by the Rev. C. Inwood. the body was com
mittod to the deep in the presence "of the offl
cers of the ship and several of the passengers.
It is untrue that we arrived flying the yellow
flag either here or In Honolulu. There was no
illness on board and the yellow flag was not
hoisted until it was ordered by the quarantine
officer. We dropped anchor within the pre
scribed limits to await medical Inspection,
which Is the ordinary custom adopted by
healthy ships.
Captain Allen informs us that In addition
to these three cases the only other Illness on
board since leaving Hongkong was a fireman
with bruises on shoulder, who returned to
work next day. nnd a case of bronchitis, where
the man was sick for two days. So far as any
one knows there was no Illness amone the
Japanese stowaways, as they were In the Coal
bunkers and so cut off from crew and passen
gers.
We submit this statement not as a protest
or complaint against our detention here, but
simply with the view of putting the public In
possession of the facts. We pre, sir, yours
faithfully, J. R FF.ARN. M. I>.

COMSTOCK MINES.
The official statement of the superintendent
' of the Consolidated California and Virginia
mine for the week ending June 30 reads as fol
' lows: "The Comstock Pumping Association,
i has been engaged In the following- work at the
'â  C. and C. shaft: 1400 levelâ west drift has
been extended 23 feet; total length, 660 feet;
the face being In vein porphyry and clay. 1650
i âNecessary repairs are being made on this
' level. 1750 levelâ The stores have been ex
tended south and west and we have raised one
floor. The ore in the new ground referred to
In last week's report has ranged in width from
8 to 10 feet. If has a northeast and southwest
course and dips to the southeast on the Fill
floor, where we have followed the hanging wall
portion of the ore to the east. The best and
richest portion of the ore is now in the bot
tom. In raising on the ore we found that near
the caps of the third floor set the hanging wall
clay turns over and runs west nearly flat. The
$50 ore reported last week extended but a short
distance above the point where it was then
! sampled. The ore going west in the new
ground assays from $20 to $25 per ton, gold
i value. Above the clay we found old timbers.
As near as can be determined the ore in the
j new or unworked ground goes off sharply to
the west and dips below the track floor of the
! 1158 level. In making room to work and while
'. stoplng ore we have extracted during the week
i 100 tons of ore of a gold value of $16 75 per ton.
A large part of the ore Is from new ground
'. and a little from old fillings. We also extract
ed about 15 tons of $9 ore that was separated
from the ore of higher grade. 1800 â When our
compressor on the surface was subjected to a
i working strain we found several defects that
had to be repaired before we could depend
upon it to furnish us with a steady supply of

j morrow work will begin on this level. The '
; station seems to be in good condition, hut as !
there Is a great deal of slum and broken tim- |
ber on the level It is not possible to state at ;
this writing how soon development work . can ,'
be started. The water is again down near the I
' 1950 level and we hope soon to open that level." j
The official statement from the Ophlr mine
reads as follows: "No underground work has
been done through our shaft during the week.
Central tunnelâ The north drift has been ex
tended 8 feet: total length, 376 feet.; face In
clay, quartz and porphyry. The face Is now
in Mexican ground. On the north line of Ophlr
and south line of Mexican a Joint east cross
cut was started and advanced 20 feet. When
9 feet In, a heavy hanging clay wall was cut
into with a little quartz on the east side of the
clay. The face Is In soft porphyry. This cross
cut will be extended a short distance further
as there is a known vein to the east of us. If
this vein is not found in a short distance we
will, before extending the east crosscut, run a
Joint west crosscut on the line of the two mines
so as to learn the position of the footwall of
the vein that we have been following to the
south. The Sutro tunnel direct connection was
advanced 19 feet; total length, 228 feet; face
in soft porphyry. At a point 224 feet in we
struck a vein 4 feet thick standing nearly ver
tical and dipping to the west. The vein is
largely quartz, showing some gold and silver,
but no ore of value. When the drift is ad

This is an age of specialists, and the
work of the food specialist is of great

DIVIDENDS MAY
SOON BE PAID
ON WATER STOCK
New Schedule Will Be
Profitable.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 3.
The new schedule of water rates went
! into effect yesterday, and it is now .in- ,
I nounced that the Contra Costa will soon
j commence paying dividends. This stute- ;
mentis causing much surprise, as the
new schedule is commonly supposed to
i be in the main lower than that of last â¢
; year. The rates paid until July 1 are i
: those of the "Solid Six," who were re- j
tired from public office last April, and are
so high that the companies waited six
months for popular Indignation to de- ;
I crease before they put them' ln force, In
four years no dividends have been paid, i
and the value of the stock went down till <
it was sold for 30. When full rates were i
charged the price went up to 70, and to
day it is quoted at 72%.
If the new schedule is lower than the j
I old one the prospect for dividends would j
j not seem to be very great, as none were j
paid under the old rates. The capitaliza
tion of the corporation has been in- j
! creased $3,000,0 iK) by the consolidation of â¢
the Oakland Company, and although the |
cost of one office and board of manage
! ment has been dispensed with this will
' not, according to the sworn reports on
I file, pay interest on the added millions and |
! on half of the bonds and then leave suf- i
ficient for dividends.

stock during the past two years are.

1 said that while there certainly would be {

would pay dividends again, but just when
ihe was not prepared to say. "There is i

WRONGED HUSBANDS REVENGE
OAKLAND, July 3.â William Ashley, a
grocer at Thirty-sixth and Grove streets,
wa.- nearly beaten to death to-day with
a poker by Robert Camfleld at the latter's
home, corner of Twenty-second and West
streets. Camfleld was arrested to-night
and booked at the City Prison for an
assault with a deadly weapon. Ashley
charges him with having attacked him
while he was delivering groceries at the
Camfield residence.
The prisoner's story is that of a wronged
husband. Ho frankly admits that he beat
Ashley and expresses sorrow that he did
not kill him. "This man has been exer
cising a hypnotic influence over my wife
for some time past," said Camfield to
night. "Two weeks ago he took her to
San Francisco and frequently, I am told,
he has tied his horstj in front of our house
twice and three times a day.
"I knew he would call to-day, and in
stead of going to work 1 lay in hiding
under the house from 5 o'clock this morn-
Ing until shortly after 2 o'clock this after
wh.-n 1 saw him enter the kitchen.
After some delay Ashley and my wife
waikt-td into the parlor, so I crawled un
der the parlor floor. Presently 1 could
hear th^m kissing. Then 1 heard my wife
say 'You had better look out, for he is
llab'le to come home at any moment. I
don't believe he went to work to-day.' I
wanted no better proof, so, crawling out
from under the house, I rushed into the
parlor, struck him over the head with a
poker, and, while the Wood was spirting
all over the carpet. I picked him up and
threw him out. 1 am sorry I did not
finish the job. He has wrecked my
home."
Mr. and Mrs. Camfleld have been mar
ried eleven years and have four children.
Ashley has several grown-up sons and
daughters. He has been married twice.

THE CLAN AGAIN IN ACTION
PAT TOOK A SHOTGUN TITLE TO
THE ARGUMENT.
Goaded to Despair by the Taunts of
Political Rivals, the Leader
of the Clan Retali
ates.
The disturbed political conditions in the
Thirtieth District which grew out of the
attempt on the part of the Clan Tomalty i
to assure his Honor the Mayor that the .
fight looked good in Tomalty's district, I
and incidentally to mash Policeman Mine- ;
nan's face into a jelly, reached a ripe
climax a night or so ago in the barroom
of Tomalty's Sixth-street gin dispensary- â¢
Unable to bear the taunts of "Stew j
Teidermann and Jimmie Mullin, two of j
Buck's close up representatives, the laud
ed chief of the far-famed clan pulled a ;
e=ma.ll-sized cannon on his political rivals ;
and under the threat of blowing their |
heads off forced the allies of the blind j
boss to beat a hasty retreat from the sa- '
loon. Those who were witnesses to the }
exciting affair have been doing all in
their power to keep the details from the
police and public.
Ever since the Clan Tomalty held its
disgraceful steam beer meeting at Acad- |
em? Hall-the one which resulted so dis
astrously for Minehan-the faithful many
of wh<.m thrive and grow fat on Tomal
tv's liberal dispensations of steam beer,
have he, n compelh 6 to b< ar in silence the
taunts which were showered on them
tuck's faction. All sorts of fun was
poked at the close up members of tne ,
clan, and they offered no retaliation, pos- ,
Blbly because three of their number were
lodged in n cell at the City Prison await
ing trial for their assault on Policeman
Minehan. Hut when "Stew" Teidermann
and Jimmie Mullin sought to make light
of the clan's power in its sacred rendez
vous and in the august presence of its
I leader caution was thrown to the â 
Minna-street breeze Pat rose to the dig- ;
nity of the situation.
In a moment Tomalty's hand was under
the bar and in another his artillery was
rained in the direction of Buck's satellites.
"ait!" Bhouted Tomalty, in tones as
deep as the pickle factory whistle
â¢â¢Stew" looked at Mull'n and Mullin
it "Stew."
"Guess Pat has a shotpun title to the
argument," murmured "Stew." and the
pair backed out of the saloon, leaving the j
faithful to writhe in the agonies or ex- ;
cessive Joy and toss bouquets at Tumulty
i ver his splendid victory.

Rev. W. S. Matthew Bends a Paper
Before the Methodist Ministers.
Rev. W. 8. Matthew held the attention
of the members of the Methodist Episco
pal Union yesterday morning with an in
teresting and forcible paper on "Expan
sion, Our Nfttlon'i Manifest Destiny and
the Duty of the Christian Church." The
thesis was an endeavor to maintain that
American expansion is meritable and that
as a consequence vast increasing responsi
bilities are laid upon the Christian church
in its relation to the successful evangeli
zation of the world.
The speaker paid a tribute to the Anglo-
Saxon race, saying they were the colo
nizers, the manufacturers and the com
mercial agents of the wor!<l. In touching
on the continued war in the Philippines
Dr Matthew said; "I shrink from war as

TWEEDIE DEFEATED
BY RUFE TURNER
Referee Fox of the Opinion That the
Australian Worked in a
Fake.
STOCKTON, July 3.â Rufe Turner, the
colored Stockton boy, who is seeking hon
ors in the lightweight class, knocked
Cocker Tweedie of Australia cold in the
eighth round of what was to have been a.
twenty-round fight. It was a hard fight
from the very start, with Tweedie out
pointing the colored boy in boxin* in
every round, so that there Is no doubt
that the decision would have beon his
had both stayed the limit. The knockout
blow was on the back of the left Jawbone
and almost under the ear, and waa thÂ«.Â«
fourth swing which Turner had made at
Tweedie's Jaw. three of them being suc
cessfully blocked.
Tweedie turned half around and fell
with th< 2 glove still at the point of his
chin, showing that ho had not placed it
back far enough by about five inches to
catch and block the fnrce of the blow.
The referee, James Fox of the Reliance
club of Oakland, counted Tweedie out and
declared Turner the winner.
Later in conversation with Instructor
E'k*Tt of the Stockton Athletic Club, ho
d. -dared that he thought Tweedie faked
the fall and the fight on his own part.
For a time he believed he had the right
to declare all bets off, and so it was
noised about, but as he had left the ring
when he made the second part of his de
cision bets stand. Fox declared that Tur
ner was not a party to the fake, but that
Tweedie and his friends were.
Many at the ringside agree with Fox
that there was no necessity for TwfWlie
going out, while others are as strongly of
the opinion that the knock-out was clean
and legitimate. The preliminary between
Frank Crowley of Marysville and Al
Doyle of San Francisco was decided a
draw.

ALAMEDA OFFICIALS
SPRING SENSATIONS
ALAMEDA. July 3.â City Trustee
Schulte created a sensation at the board
meeting to-night by openly charging City
Clerk Lamborn with holding money back
from the creditors of the city. Specifical
ly he charged that the money for one
claim had been drawn from the treasury
last April and the money had not been
paid over to the firm to whom it was due
until last Tuesday. Schulte declined to
make public the name uf the firm, but
after the Trustees adjourned Lamborn
.supplied the information. The Clerk claims
that the charges are an attempt to
â â knock" him because he would not stand
in on certain schemes of some of the
Trustees which he did not think to be
square. He gives an apparently perfect
explanation of the transaction upon which
the charges are made. The trouble grows
out of the purchase of supplies for the
last city election. After the routine busi
ness of" the meeting had been disposed of
Mr. Schulte dropped his bombshell.
"I wish to call the attention of the
board to the impairment of the city s
credit," said the Trustee. "The larger
houses have been having difficulty collect
ing rbeir money. The Clerk has been tell
ing them that our funds wen- depleted or
that we had not approved their bills. 1 ne
i fact is we always have had Plenty of.
money and are anxious to pay our bills.

tion of some kind. The bill was con
tracted last April and the money was
1 drawn from the treasury, but although
i repeated demands were made for it, 11
was not paid over by the clerk until last
, Tuesday. ' , â,,
"What do you mean by money drawn.
: inquired Mackie.
"I mean Just what I say," was the re
i ply. "A warrant was drawn and the
: money paid on it. but it did not reach
the firm until nearly three months later.
A Call correspondent asked behulte lor
the name of the firm, but the Trustee
declined to give any Information to any
newspaper concerning city affairs.
Clerk Lamborn was more communica
tive He stated that the name of t! â 
: who gave Bchulte the story was Charles
Hanley, a bo< kkeeper for H. S. Crocker
& Co., and that the bill of the firm for
election supplies is what the charges are
based upon. ..
â¢â¢I was authorized by a resolution of the
Trustees," said Mr. Lamborn, "to pur
the supplies for the last city
tion I drew for the purpose JlL'> 75 from
the Treasurer on my personal at unt l
purchased the precinct supplies from H.
lÂ§ Crocker A Co., compelling the tirm to
â ell each set at the rate of $4 96, when
Oakland wai paying $11 Â» for the samÂ«

balance of the money went for post Lgi

"I held Crocker's money in my safe until
' last Tuesday. The reason was that some

! the city was entitled to a rebate. Once
' Crocker telephoned and asked me If I had
I their money. 1 replied to send over the
I man who sold me the goods, that 1 had a
bone, to pick with him because of the
' shortage in the supplies charged for.
When 1 learned that there was likely to
1 be trouble over the matter i paid them
1 the money under protest.
"The whole business is a scheme to

actions in connection with city affairs."
Interesting developments are promised.
â  and it is openly asserted that serious ac-
I cusations against some of the City Trus

SWALLOWED A DOSE
OF CARBOLIC ACID
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 3.
Eecause her husband seemed determined
I to go to Stockton against her wishes, Mrs.
! George Maxfleld, residing at 535 Park ave
j nue, East Oakland, attempted to commit
i suicide this morning by swallowing car
bolic acid.
Mr. Maxfield had been ordered by his
employers in San Francisco to make a
i hurried business trip to Stockton, and
' when he advised his wife of his intention
: to comply she protested and grew hyster
! ical. She immediately secured a small
', bottle of carbolic acid, and before her
' husband could intercede she had swal
! low^d enough of the deadly poison to
make her unconscious.
Dr. Dodge was promptly summoned, and
after two hours of hard work Mrs. Max
field was resuscitated:* When she regained
consciousness and realized what she had
done she expressed her regrets and was
glad that her life had been saved.
Mrs. Maxneld was formerly Miss Stella
Boquet. Bhe is IS years of age and be
: came the wife of George Maxfleld less
than a year ago. Her married life has
been happy, but for the past two weeks
Ehe had been very ill and in an hysterical
condition frequently. Her mother is
wealthy and is the owner of the Silver
State House on Mason street, San Fran
cisco.

RAILROAD RUNS
A BOLD BLUFF
FOR BRIDGES
Tries a Trick on the
Government.
BLOCKING THE TIDAL CANAL
FINDS A FORGOTTEN TRACK
AND OPERATES IT.
â  â¦
Runs a Train Daily Over a Dangerous
Piece of Roadbed to Compel
Uncle Sam to Come to
Terms.
ALAMEDA, July 3.â The Southern Pa
cific Company is playing a bold bluff to
prevent the Government from carrying
out its plans of constructing a combined
railroad and wagon bridge over the tidal
canal where the company's tracks will
cross it when completed. The railroad
people have stood out for separate
bridges, claiming that It would work a
-peat hardship if they were forced to
fcove their tracks to the site of the pro
posed combination bridge, and besides
that, it would be dangerous to allow
horses and railroad trains to travel over
the same structure. v t Â«. ;â 
When this argument was being used trie
railroad had but one track crossing the
canal. Now it has two widely separated,
and it proposes to force the Government
to build bridges for both or leave the tidal
canal in its present unfinished condition.
The second track which has sprung into
prominence in the last few days has not
been in use for ten years. It was lost sight
of in a luxuriant growth of weeds. Bust
has left little of the rails, and the ele
ments have disposed of most of the road
bed The track runs from what used to
be Fernside station to High street, and Is
part of the original Alameda county Rail
road, built and operated by the late A. A.
Cohen, long before the Southern Pacific
was heard of. . . Â_
Mr. Huntington's company has just dis
covered the Importance of the forgo a<n
line and is now backing a train over It
every day at the risk of wrecking an en
gine and a couple of cars. No passengers
are carried. The train starts from no
where and apparently goes to the same
place. It comes over from OaKlanu t:\erj
afternoon a little past 3 o'clock, and alt. r
going through the formality of running
over the old track continues on tnrouÃii
Alameda. This has been going on for
several days, and it is stated it will con
tinue as long as Mr. iluntington has an
object In view. The track crosses the line
of the canal about 300 yards west of th.
track that has been regularly used. It is
announced that the Southern Pacific
Company will claim that the old track is
necessary in the conduct of its business
and will insist that the Government build
a bridve for- it when the canal is cut
through. As a compromise it will demand
a double track bridge where it originally
wanted a single one entirely distinct from
the wagon bridge.
i ALLEGED ATTEMPT TO ROB.
Mrs. Kate Sullivan Prefers a Serious
Charge Against Thomas Sulli
van, a Stevedore.
Thomas Sullivan, a stevedore living on
Moss street, was arrested yesterday
aftcrnon by Policemen Callahan and ;
Conlon and booked at the City Prison on
a charge of attempt to commit robbery.
i The complaining witness against him Is,
Mrs. Kate Sullivan of 831 Bryant street.
Mrs. Sullivan said she was walking |
home yesterday afternoon with $2 50 in j
her right hand, which she had got from
a lady" on Fifth street. As she passed a
corner grocery at Folsom and Sixth
streets Sullivan, who was with another
man. approached her and asked her for
10 cents. She gave him a dime and he
made a snatch at her hand to get the
! rest of the money. She was struggling
with him. when he struck her on the
i mouth, knocking her down. Her head
I struck on the hard sidewalk, cutting her
scalp. Sullivan then ran away.
Mrs Sullivan was taken to the Receiv- .
ing Hospital, where the wounds on her j
mouth and scalp were dressed, and he
was sent to the City Prison to sober up. j
Sullivan denied the woman's story and j
positively declared that he bad never seen :
ior heard of her before. He admitted he i
had been drinking and was surprised
< when Policeman Callahan called him out
i of a saloon and placed him under arrest.
He says It is a case of mistaken identity.
CHARTER SUIT READY.
E. S. Pillsbury. Plaintiff's Attorney,
Seeks to Have the Case Set.
City and County Attorney Lane is anx-
I ious to indefinitely postpone the trial of
! the suit to determine the validity of the
i charter brought by Superintendent of
Streets Fragrley for that pur
pose Yesterday morning E. S. Pills
bury, who represents Mr. Fragley, ap
peared before Judge Bahrs and asked
that the case be set for hearing on Thurs
day next. City and County Attorney
Lane opposed the motion on the ground
that he had not had sufficient notice to
; enable him to prepare for trial. On this
â¢ statement JudÂ£e Bahrs continued the case
i until Wednesday morning, at which time
! it is expected that Judge Seawell, who
will henr the case, will be on the bench
and set the case for early hearing.
Coroner's Verdict Set Aside.
Coroner Hill held an inquest yesterday
on the body of Mrs. Dollie Walsh, who
poisoned herself with carbolic acid at 88
Third street on June 30. Nothing new was
elicited but the jury returned a verdict
of suicide "while temporarily insane,"
Coroner Hill set aside the verdict because
it was not warranted by the evidence, and
made it plain suicide.

BABY ALLIGATOR'S
NARROW ESCAPE
WEYLER LOSES A GOOD MEAL
WKYI^KR, the big alligator at the Chutes, attempted to make a
nipal off the young saurian who has been sharing his tank for the
last two months, yesterday afternoon, and but for the prompt in
terference of Ed Rabe, the Chutes electrician, the youngster
would now be among the missing. As It is he bears the marks of
the unequal combat in the shape of two long deep gashes on his
lack, together with numerous smaller wounds on various parts of
his body, made by the teeth of his heavy-weight antagonist.
Weyler, like his notorious namesake, is of an evil disposition and when
the baby 'gator was dumped into the tank a couple of months ago he waa
immediately given to understand that he was not a welcome guest. However,
Weyler did not at the time give, any evidence of cannibalistic designs and
Superintendent Kemp did not anticipate any danger to his young charge.
Alligators are notorious for eating their young in moments of abstraction,
but this seldom occurs after the younger members of the family have cut
their eye teeth. The young alligator, who has not yet attained the dignity of
a name, is about five feet long and weighs in the neighborhood of twenty-five
or thirty pounds, while Weyler is double his length and weighs nearly 600
Yesterday afternoon Weyler was in a particularly ugly mood and butted
his young companion around viciously at every opportunity. Finally as the
youngster was making a short cut across the narrow tank Weyler's great
jaws suddenly opened and closed with a snap and the horrified spectators saw
that the baby was held fast in his capacious maw. Manager Meyers was
notified and he immediately sent for Ed Rabe, who has had a great deal of ex
pi rience with animals of all kinds, from lions to monkeys. Rabe promptly
grabbed Weyler by the tail and dragged him from the pool. The big brute,
angered at such unlooked-for Interference, opened his mouth to repel the
attack, and his victim, taking advantage of the opportunity, struggled from
the death trap into the water.
As soon as he saw that the youngster was free, Rabe released his grip on
r's tail, and jumping across the pool quickly dragged the baby 'gator
out of the water before his enemy could get a fresh hold. The little fellow
iken to the "Zoo" and placed among the other babies of his kind. While
|y Injured, it is not thought that his injuries will prove fatal. Possibly
:â  will be in a more amiable mood after he digests the nice live pig
â : has been selected fur his supper to-night.

to end the bickering Blankcn advised
Muscat to let the woman go away, but
Muscat would not consent. He said that

The testimony of Pierre Casaville, land- ;
â  lord of the lodging house at 1300tf Stock

-1 cused Mr. < 'asaville said that ho had
been obliged to put Muscat out of the ;
house because he was disturbing the rest
, of the lodgers by his abuse of Mrs. San- ,
i chez when he was drunk. On several :
occasions sho was obliged to go down
Btaira and hide herself until Muscat went
But the most damaging part of Land
lord Casaville's story was that Muscat
on one of those occasions told him that
he would kill Mrs. Sanchez. One day,
! when Muscat was drunk, ho asked Casa

j WACHENDORF GETS MORPHINE
Smuggled Into Him in Prison by-
Some Unknown Person.
Dr. C. C. J. "Wachendorf Is determined
that the walls of the City Prison will ng*
prevent him getting a supply of morphine
to inject into his veins. Detectives Egan
and Silvey visited him yesterday morning
and were struck by his bright appear
ance. They suspected something was
\vr. ng and searched him. They were sur
prised to find in his pockets a small bot
tle of morphine, some of which had been
used. All their questioning could not get
out of him where or how he got it.
Dr. Rice of the Receiving Hospital has
been giving him an occasional injection
and has been reducing the quantity daily.
Wachendorf wanted more, but the doctor
refused, and he took other means to get
it. The detectives were unable to find a
needle on him.
Detectives Egan and Silvey are gradu
ally completing the chain of evidence
against Dr. Wachendorf. Yesterday they
ascertained that several days before the
alleged murder Wachendurf visited a
pawnshop kept by a man named Coleman
at 1306 Market street and producing a
gold-tilled watch asked him how much It
was worth. Suspecting that he had stolen
it, the pawnbroker refused to buy the
timepiece. Waehendorf then claimed that
t)i>^ watch was his own. and instructed
<â â >!< man to repair It, as it was out of
order.
(Mi learning that "U'achendorf was ac
cused of the murder of Kehlenbeck the
pawnbroker yesterday visited police head
quarters andetmned the watch over to
Silvpy and Egan. They subsequently con
i fronted Wachendorf with the timepiece
1 and asked him if it belonged to him. After
; considerable questioning they finally
: gained from him that he had received the
; timepiece frnni a friend, whose name he
refused to divulge.
The detectives have two responsible wit
, nesses who are willing to swear that the
watch was the property of Kf.-hlenbc-i'k.
I They will be produced when the prelim
: mary examination is held In the Police
i Court. The prison officials are determined
to thwart any attempt on the part of the
i accused doctor to lommit suicide. Captain
j Seymour has placed a trusty In front of
â  his cell with instructions to keep a strict
I watch on the prisoner.

ZIV. Boom! Ah!
There's money to burn In San
Francisco. , .
The Glorious Fourth has arrived
once more and San Franciscans are
prepared to celebrate it as never before
in their lives. They are ready to give ex
pression to more pent-up patriotism than
the citizens of any other community on
1hÂ« continent. They have don. it before
and they know they can do it again. The
passing day will tell.
In times past this city has been noted
far and wide for its magnificent celebra
tions of the nation's natal day. It has
burned more powder, made more noise,
flown more flags, had bigger parades and
done more to illuminate the dusky heav
ens than any single municipality in the
T'nited State's. This year it has only to
outdo itself and the expectations of no
one will be exceeded at that.
By the calendar San Francisco has no
more hours In its Fourth of July than any
other locality. Still, somehow or other, it
manages to crowd in many an extra one.
so that it is most impossible to deter
mine either when it begins or ends. The
small boy hereabout believes that it
dawns about the Ist of June each year,
nnd he knows it never ends until he has
f.red his last cracker or received a pain
ful visit from the family physician. Many
of the small boy's elders are of the same
opinion, and lend their extra change to
the purpose of provoking: the constant
poppingâ probably out of compliment to
the blushing bridesâ the month of June.
A stranger In the city would wonder
whatVwas going to be left for the real eel-;
rbration â the brief twenty-four hours that
he imagines constitutes a San Francisco
Fourth of July. That stranger has not
long to wait to find out. If he has any
ears left after the fusillades of firecrack
ers that for days have been announcing
the. coming of the great day. he would
better plug them up before he plunges
into the patriotic din which was in full
swing before he got his second sleep. Hr
will smell more powder than he ever
smelled before in any city: he will witness
n parade, in which the regulars of XJncle
Sam, cavalry, infantry and artillery; com
panies of the National Guard and Naval
Militia: recruits for the Philippines; and
cadets full of desire to~be soldiers, will
march. In line also will be the veterans
of three wars, the aged survivors of the
Mexican and Civil wars, and their, young
er followers, the volunteers wounded in
the southern seas, not yet recovered.
To the music of scores of bands will
inarch representatives of a? fine-looking
a police force as any on earth and a divls

Disease is a great and treacherous ocean.
Man ever stands upon its shore and gazes
out over its calm surface without a thought
of danger. It licks his feet â it advances
and recedes almost playfully â all the
same it will crack his bones and eat him,
and wipe the crimson foam from its jaws
as if nothing had happend, as it has been
doing ever since the world began.
A man who carelessly saunters along the
shore of the insatiate sea of disease, will
some day encounter a great storm in the
form of some fatal malady and will be en-
gulfed. Because a man does not have to go
to bed when he suffers from a trivial indi-
gestion, because he does not have to give
up work when he gets nervous and cannot
sleep at night, because he can still force
down an unsatisfactory meal when he is
suffering: from loss of appetite, because by
strong effort he can add a column of figures
with aching head â is no reason t^iat these
disorders are trifling or to be neglected.
They are the warnings of serious sickness.
A man who promptly heeds them, and re-
sorts to the right remedy, will speedily re-
cover his usual health. The man who neg-
lects them will find that he is in the grip
of consumption, some nervous disorder, or
some other dread malady, due to improper
or insufficient nutrition. Dr. Pierces

the young men of any State. There will
be large representations of many civic
and military organizations and industrial
societies, carrying artistic floats. Drum
corps without end and flfers unnumbered
will furnish music for the marching ca
dets, end the whole will be closed up with
a turnout of well-known citizens in car
riages.
It !s estimated that no loss than ten
thousand will be In the line, which starts
from the foot of Market street. The Da
rad" will take no ;Â«rss than an hour and
a half to pass a given point, and what,
with the countermarch for review, it
will be lunch-time when the order comes
to break ranks.
For the afternoon there Is officially pro
. for the entertah.rr.r-;.t uf those w.hn
have r;ot gpne on picnics or outings Into
untry, "r to witness the many pro
grammes of holiday sports, a literary and
musical programme nt Metropolitan Ter
n: ranged with the design of plumbing
the depths of patriotic feeling in every
breast.
And in the evening the provision for a
display of fireworks in the high heavens
has been most lavish. In addition to
those that may be set off at various
places of amusement and by private par
- will be three public exhibi
tions in as many parts of th* city, one at
Sixteenth and Folsom streets, for the
nltes; one at Washington Park, for
the North Beachers, and a third at the
Chutes, for the wrstern portion of the
city. A larg* pum of money has been ex
â l for the latest ::!;.! best in fire
works for those displays, and they ought
to be the finest San Franciscans have
ever seen and a fitting end to a most glo
rious Fourth of July.

ful of the danger, took the pistol and,

another, connected with most of the fam

large ami dangerous mine fires are still
the talk of the old-timers along the street.

MISFORTUNES OF
HIS PARENTS LED
HIM TO CRIME
The Down-Hill Road
of Richard Jessup.
IS NOW IN A PRISON CELL
FATHER ONCE OWNED A COM
FOBTABLE FOBTUNE.
The Young Man Came Home to Find
Him a Bankrupt and Deserted
by His Family and
Friends.
Richard Jessup, alias Rooney, charged
with having burglar's tools In hts pus
session, appeared again yesterday before
Judge Mogan. It was explained to the
Judge that Richard, who is only a boy IS
years of age, had been engaged in carv
ing an epitaph on a tombstone in the
yard in the rear of 408 McAllister street,
and it- was the chisel used in that work
that was found on him early Thursday
mornlng by Policeman Glllen.
The Judge, knowing the boy's history,
said that he did not like to have the
stain recorded against him of having bur
glar's tools in his possession, and the boy
promised to go to Redding to his father.
The Judge told him to write to his sister
and brother-in-law in San Rafael, asking
them to come to court to-morrow morn
ing, and if they promised that he would
be sent to Redding and get work there
he would be allowed to go on thirty days'
probation, and if he behaved himself the
case would be dismissed.
In the early To's isaac Jessup owned
the larger part of that district of San
Rafael named on the official maps as
West End. He was of a sporting tendency
and had "money to burn." He married a
daughter of a Mrs. Crosby and by her
had three children. The oldest boy was
named Richard, the youngest Edward and
the girl Grace. The daughter is now the
wife of Howard Smith, a solicitor for
Bushnell, the photographer. Jessup loved
his wife, but on her part it was com
monly spoken of as a match for money.
In the latter part of the 'Su's Gresham
P. Jessup, a brother of Isaac, died and
left him vast property interests. Isaac
Jessup and the father-in-law of General
Dickinson were named in the will as ex
ecutors and the probating of the will was
left to General Dickinson. In the midst
of probate proceedings Colonel Kowalsky
and Senator, alias "Detective," Mahoney,
discovered another heir in the shape or
a putative son of deceased. The mother
was a student at Mills Seminary. Isaac
could have compromised for $2u,000. and
wanted to do so, but was advised other
wise by Dickinson, and fought the case,
with the result that he not only lost all
that was willed to him by his brother, but
was thrown in debt to the sum of $10,imXi.
Judge Coffey was twice overruled by the
Supreme Court In the bitter contest at
law which proved so disastrous to Isaac
Jessup. , â 
Following: this contest Jessup met with
financial reverses and the most of his
property was soon sold or heavily
mortgaged. His %vife was fond of lliKh
living and when she found her. husband
could no longer indulge her every whim
they disagreed. The boy Dick was sent
East andplaced in the care of Isaac's rel
atives. Three or four years ago the wife
left the husband and went to live with the
family of a prominent San Francisco
butcher named Keys, whose home is on
Van Ness avenue. The wife of Keys was
the aunt of Mrs. Jessup and when she
died Mrs. Crosby (Mrs. Jessup' a mother*,
who had secured a divorce from .'er own
husband, married Keys. This explains
why Mrs. Jseeup went there to live. In
time Mrs. Jessup secured a divorce from
Isaac, who made no contest.
Poor, aged and friendless, everybody
having deserted him In his tln-.e of need,
Isaac went to Redding, on Still water
Creek, in Shasta County and engaged In
farming and fruit raising. He took his
son Edward with him. hut the boy .lid not
live long after the separation of his pa
rents Isaac is now at Redding, contrary
to reports of his death, and is the father
and not the uncle of Dick, as recounted In
A few weeks ago the boy Pick, who
shipped on a man-. war and â Micllr.l
powder In the war with Spain; appeared
in San Rafael. His coming was not de
sign for any exhibition of warmth on the
part of those who had been th< friends of
his parents in the days of their Wealth;
and the boy came to San FrnnclSCO to *.-<'
his mother. Instead of welcoming and up
sisting him he was "given tho oold phoul
der" by the ono who should hnvo onrod
the most for him. ttt had no funds with
which to travel to his father. IMsoourapod
and angered by the treatment ho had ro
ceived. the boy drifted around the olty
and tlnnlly foil in with bad ooninaMy. th.
result being that he was found with burp
lar"s tools In hi* j>'" i 1 and landed 111
