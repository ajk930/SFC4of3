FALSE RUMORS
OF THE RELIEF
OF LADYSMITH
LONDON. Dee. IS.-Word of the small
ruceess won by General French near
Naauwpoort: the persistent though com
pletely unconfirmed rumor that Lady
smith hnd been relieved and thousands
of Boers taken prisoners: reporta from
Chlei-eley ramp, under date if Tuesday,
that General Bullcr's force was ready to
move, but that the British reconnoltortng
parties had tailed to draw the fire of the
IÂ»oers. who *eÂ«>mfil to have Instructions
to mask their positions* until our infantry
advances: and Lord MÂ«thuÂ»n"s report of
casualties*, with names of officers and the
numbers of the rank and Qle killed or
vounded in the l>attle âthese are features
of the South African news.
Most of the newspapers In commenting
upon Methuen's losses ref<-r Impressively
to the RTÂ«Â«a.t number killed and wounded
In the battles of the Crimean. American
Civil, and Turko-Russlan and Franco-
Prussian wars and the?i go on to argue
that in comparison with these fjgures fhe
percentage of loss suffered In the British
advance toward fOmberiey is much less
than might be expected when the nature
of the ground and character of the at
tack are taken into consideration. Just
the same the newspapers all urge that
the War Office bestir itself and rush
heavy reinforcements to the Cape as
quickly as possible.
In th!Â« connection it is stated that the
*.r-\"*nth division is to be mobilized im
mediately and that an eighth division will
be formed and hrld in reserve.
By Sunday four battalions of the Sixth
Division will have started, while the
troops of the Fifth Division, now at sea,
ought to have begun landing at the Cape
by this time.
As to the rumor of the relief of Lady
*mlth. it created a Bcene of tremendous
excitement on the Stock Exchange, where,
the effect of Gataere's Rnd Methuen's re
verFeÃ had been felt most severely. The
report began to be circulated on the â¢â¢x
change yesterday afternoon that Buller
find Clcery had relieved I^adysmlth and
taken lO.ono prisoners. I>ater on it was
freely stated that a private telegram re
ceived in KdlnbunTh announced that Gen
eral Buller had inflicted a decisive defeat
on the enemy.
This caused a wild outburst of enthusi
asm. Broker* yelled, flung their hats in
the air. sang and cheered. A firmer tone,
became noticeable, but It lasted only a
little while, as the news agency was
officially Informed that the War Office
had received no information respecting
the rumor. It is paid now that the re
port wan got up by a clique who were
endeavoring to stop the flump in South
African shares.
The. British losses at Magcrsfonteln are
522. of which more than 7*o were In the
Highland Brigade. Of the officers fifteen
were killed and forty-^even wounded,
while nix are missing. About SOOO British
were engaged, so that 10 per cent were
killed or wounded. The Highland Brigade,
with TOO men down out of Its strength of
sm to 3500, lost 20 per cent.

METHUEN'S DEFEAT MAKES
THE BRITISH SITUATION MOST
DIFFICULT IN SOUTH AFRICA
WASHINGTON. Dec. 14.â Major W. A. Simpson, the
War Department's expert, in summarizing the situ
ation in South Africa, says:
"The result of Methuen's right on the Modder
River makes the British situation rather difficult
Reports are very meager, but are sufficient to show that the
British attacked the Boers in strong position and were re
pulsed. Metbuen reports the Boers as 12.000 strong. It would
be interesting to know whether he had such information be
forehand, or whether he learned it by the strength of their
resistance. If he knew it beforehand he should not have at
tacked, provided in.- own force numbered, as is generally sup
posed, not more than 11.000. For one army to attack another
of equal, or superior strength, behind earthworks, and of good
fighting material, is suicidal.
"Methuen could not expect to be successful in his advance
unless he was superior In numbers, and this he does not appear
to be. if he did not know the strength of the Boers before
hand, he has given still another instance In this remarkable
campaign of the error of going into action without thorough
reconnoissance, or in other ways obtaining accurate Informa
tion as to the enemy's strength and position. It would seem
that the experience of White at Nicholson? Nek and Gatacre
near Stormberg Junction would have proved of value. Whether
he can hold his own is a question. He has a single line of
railway behind him. He is about fifty miles north of Orange
River and 130 miles from De Aar Junction.
"To be cut off from his communications would be much
more serious for him than it was for General White at Lady
Boers. The classical method of storm
ing an intrenched position is first to
bombard heavily and Just before the as
sault pour in a perfect storm of shells.
Then inmÂ»Hilat^U the Infantry go i >r

"I must say that I have never thought
that we are sending out enough men.
When once it was known that we had to
send an army corps I told Lord LanÂ«

he would not be sending enough. In ma

on the same principle.
"This war Is otic of the blggent upon

MASONS HONOR THE MEMORY OF
BROTHER GEORGE WASHINGTON
Members of tlie Craft of All Degrees Gather at
the Mount Vernon Tomb and Dulu Ob
serve the Centennial of the Death
of the Father of His Country.
RED MEN ALSO PAY HOMAGE
WASHINGTON, â  Dec 14.-Wlth
solemn pomp and circumstance,
with ceremonies beautiful. Im
pressive and appropriate, In the
presence of a distinguished as
semblage and in the full splendor of ideal
autumn weather, the centennial of the
death of George Washington was com
memorated to-day at Mount Vernon. That
Mount Vernon should have been selected
as the scene of the exercises was pecu
liarly fitting. There It was that the hap
piest Incidents of Washington's life oc
curred. In other parts he endured his
trials, on other fields 'he won his
triumphs; but there, surrounded by those
whom best he loved, were spent the rest
ful, quiet, studious hours of his life. There
It was. too, that he sickened and died,
and there all that was mortal of him
was laid to eternal rest in a mausoleum
ovarlooldn% a broad sweep of the pic
turesque Potomac.
To-day's ceremonies were elaborately
planned and successfully carried to
fruition. They were conducted by the
Masonic bodies and by the Red Men of
the United States. The movement for the
day's observance originated in 1593 with
the Grand Lodge of Masons of the State
Of Colorado, the proposition being made
by Most Worshipful William D. Wright,
grand master of Colorado, who was pres
ent to witness the carrying into effect of j
his long-cherished Idea. Charge of the
ceremonies incident to to-day's commem- â 
oration was placed in the hands of the
Masons of Virginia, it being in the Old
Dominion that Washington was obligated
as a Master Mason and there that he par
ticipated enthusiastically In Masonic
work and observances. The officers of
the Grand Lodge of Virginia and the
membership of Kredericksburg Lodge, in
which Washington was made a Mason,
and of Washington-Alexandria Lodge,
over which he presided as worshipful
master, had the chief part in the duty of
t-o'-liiK that to-day's observance* were ap
propriate.
That the duty was well performed wag
evidenced by the solemnity and beauty of
the ceremonies and by the Immense con
course of Masons present. Thousands
were In attendance from all parts of the
country and aim. every jurisdiction in
the United States and a few foreign coun
tries were represented by some of the
grand otlicers and members. The visiting
members, many accompanied by the
ladies of their families, congregated in
Washington early to-day, and escorted by
the Masonic bodies of the District of Co
lumbia, headed by the Grand Lodge of
the District, made the pilgrimage to :
Mount Vernon to-day by boat. The Vir- !
ginia Masons assembled at Alexandria j
and thence escorted by Fredeiicksburg '
Lodge and Washington-Alexandria Lodge
as bodies proceeded to Mount Vernon also
by boat. .". . â¢ t? -;â¢

ter of his State, left Washington on a |
special electric train for Mount Vernon,
arriving there at 11 o'clock. The Presi
dential party was greeted by Grand
Master Duke of Virginia, and by him as*
corted to the mansion.
It was nearly an hour and a half after
ward before all of the steamers bearing
the Masonic bodies arrived.
After the President and his Cabinet had
reviewed them from a. platform on the
east front of the mansion a procession
was formed and moved, as on the day of
General Washington's funeral, December
18, 1799, to the old vault, where the re
mains were llrst deposited. There, In the
Immediate presence of the grand officers
of the various States and the assembled
Masons, solemn funeral rites were con
ducted.

tion on the life and work of Washington,

ginia and visiting brethren standing in a
semi-circle, facing the entrance to the
tomb, with Joined hands. Prayer was of
fered by the Rev. G. H. Ray. D.D., grand

tions of the Western States and those of

cence; the grand master of Missouri de
posited the white glove as a token |of
friendship, and the grand master of Cali
fornia deposited the evergreen as an em
blem of the Masonic faith In the resur
rection of the body and the Immortality
of the soul.
At the conclusion of the ceremony the
following response! were made:
The craftâ "Amen." -
All the grand mastersâ "O death, where
Is thy sting?"
The craftâ "O grave, where Is thy vic
tory?"
Scores of beautiful wreaths and bunches
of evergreens were then deposited within
the tomb, one of the most beautiful
tokens. an. immense wreath of Ivy, im
mortelles and acacia blossoms being of
fered by President McKinley.
The procession returned to 'the cast
front of the mansion, where .President
McKinley. Introduced by Grand Master
Duke, delivered the following oration as
his tribute to Washington:
We have Just participated In a service com
memorative of the one hundredth anniversary
of the death of George Washington. At his old
home, which he loved so well* and which the
patriotic women of the country have guarded
with loving hands, exercises are conducted un
der the auspices of the great fraternity of Ma
sons, which a century axo planned and executed
the solemn ceremonial which attended th*
Father of his Country, to his tomb. The lodge
In which he was initiated, and the one over
which he afterward presided aÂ» worshipful mas
ter, accorded positions of honor at his obse
quies, are to-day represented here in token of
profound respect to the memory of their moat
Illustrious member and beloved brother.

nies as dignified and impressive as possible,
and most cordial greetings â  have, come from j
across our border* and from beyond the sea.

family acknowledges him as one of Its great
est benefactors. Public bodies, patriotic socie
ties and other organizations, our citizens every
where, have esteemed It a privilege to-day to
pay their tribute to his memory and. to the
uplendor of his achievements In the advance
ment of Justice and liberty among men. His
fair name, secure In Its Immortality, shall shine
through countless ages with undlmlnlshed lus
ter.
The struggling republic for which Washing
ton was willing to give his life, and for which
he ever freely spent his fortune, and which at
all times was the object of his most earnest
solicitude, has steadily and wonderfully devel
oped along the lines which his sagacity and
foresight carefully planned. It has stood every
trial, and at the dawn or a new century Is
stronger than ever to carry forward Its mission
of liberty. During all the Intervening years It
has been true, forever true, to the precepts of
the constitution which he and his illustrious
colleagues framed for Its guidance and govern
ment. He was the national architect, says.
Bancroft, the historian, and out for him the
nation could not have achieved Its Independ
ence could not have formed Its union, could
not have put the Federal Government Into
operation.
He had neither precedent nor predecessor.
His work was original and constructive and
lias .uecÂ«isful]y stood the severest tests.
He selected the site for the capital of the
republic he founded and gave It the name of
â¢he Federal city, but the commission substi
tuted the name of Washington as the more
nttlnÃ and to be a perpetual recognition of the
service of the commander In chief of the Conti
nental army, the president of the convention
which framed the constitution and the first
President of the republic. More than 70.000.n00
Â«f People acknowledge allegiance to the flag
which he made triumphant The nation Is his
best euloclst and his noblest monument.
I have been deeply Interested and touched by
the sentiments of his contemporaries uttered
a hundred years ago on the occasion of his
death.
The President at this point quoted eulo
gies of Washington delivered one hun
dred years ago by Rev. Walter King at
Norwich. Conn., by Rev. Nathan Strong
at Hartford. Conn., and by John Adams
In an address to the Senate, and said In
conclusion:
The nation needs at this moment the help
of his wise example. In dealing with our vast
responsibilities we turn to him. We Invoke the
counsel of his life and character and courage,

authors and orators till the stage for a period

In the admiration or affection of their own
countries. Of them all only Washington Is In
the thought and reverence of the whole world.
The resistless harvester In his annual rounds
shoulders the scythe as he passes before this
beneficent Intelligence and pure fame, salutes
and marches on. We. his countrymen, after
a century, whose searchlight has revealed the
vices and weaknesses of our heroes and made
our Ideals common clay, find no flaw In his
public or private life, no sentence In the many
volumes of his utterances which we would blot
out. The orator who stands In my place In the
coming centuries to recount the marvelous story
of the great republic, to recall Its architects
and builders, will find the wisdom and example
for Its guidance and growth In the achieve
ments, character and life of George Washing
ton.
Rev. Henry N. Couden, Chaplain of the

PLAN TO TUNNEL THE
GIBRALTAR STRAITS
Giaantic Undertaking Advanced
by a Famous French
Engineer.
0 T"-\ARIB. Dec. 15.â A gigantic undertaking: for tunneling the Straits of #
Â£ I J Gibraltar Is receiving attention now. M. Jean Berller. a famous civil â¦
* \~ engineer, who Is the author of the project, has Just published In book T
*" 1 form the result of his studies In connection with It. He considers that *
â an international tunnel, uniting Spain and Moroceo^and prolonged by â J
ta railway from Tangier* to I>alla Magllnla. would prove Invaluable for the <,
â¦ successful development of France's African colonies. J
T From soundings taken by him M. Berller has proved the existence of a < >
1 compact rock formation across the straits, which guarantees solidity and â¦
1 Impermeability. The undertaking, be says, would be no more difficult than J â¢
<*. the piercing of Mount Censls. St. Gothard. Arlberg or Slmplon. He adds J
â¦ that if diplomatic obstacles are not greater than thÂ« natural ones, success Â
*?' is certain. â¦
I M. Berller estimates that a tunnel of forty-one kilometres (twenty-five â¦
1 and one-half miles) would cost $123,000,000. and that the work would require o
i i seven years. He calculates that the connection of the lines of the Algerian I
â¦ Railway system and extension from Tanglers to Lalla Magllnla would cost Â
4> another |lÂ«.0On.0O0 or J19.000.000. so that the whole enterprise would neces- . âº

paign committees met in Joint session

burn presided and said he had been
threatened with defeat for Senator If the
Democratic State officers made a con
test, but he had ridden fourteen
miles In a buggy to tell the committee
that he favored a contest, even If It re

ing before the Legislature:

anil that the Democrats quickly demand that
these candidates, in proper legal course, contest
the election of the ReDubltcan candidates to
whom certificates have been Issued.
Hesolved. That It is the unanimous sens* of
the State Central Democratic executive and
campaign committees that William Goebel
should make a contest as authorized by law
for the of flee of Governor, and that J. W.
Hicham should make a contest for the office
of lieutenant Governor, and that we heartily
indorse the contests already commenced by the
other candidates on the Democratic State ticket.

A paper on ' N-u Fruit Creations,'! by
I.utlict Hurhank of Santa Rosa was read
l.y I'rof^.sK.r I). T. Flower. It Htated that
the fruit grower of to-day must have the
alilllty to IhPI himself to new methods,
new fruit." and new mark.-ts. By means
of told ?tornÂ»;<-> and rapid transit the
tinest fruit of every Una can be found
in the market. With the old world .is
a market tompetition Is keen and only
the bei-t fruit in the best condition wifi
pay. Fortunately it generally costs much
1Â»-sh per ton to produce larÂ«e. -â  -CUUMI
fruit than to produce th<Â» poorest and
meanest specimens that are ever offered.
Small fruit exhausts the tree more rapid
ly than lÂ«rif<- fruit, as one pound of skin.
Monen and seeds represents ten or twelve
pounds of fruit pulp. It will thus be seen
that Improved varieties which produce
unlfoimly line fruit are more economical.
The tree that needs a great deal of prun
ing to keep It in proper form and vigorous
growth should be replaced by one of bet
ter habit of Krowth. for every ton of wood
tak-'n fD'tn ihÂ»* orchard represents as
much in weight of fruit. I!- discussed tho
merits and defects of till own fruit pro
ductions and introductions. H. had been
laboring constantly for sixteen years In
produclnÃ fruits and berries. The paper
wjs applauded.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15. 1899.
B. N. Rowley of San Francisco reported
for the committee on legislation to sup
press the ale of infected fruit. The com
mittee recommended that the growers
keep their orchards clean and free from
pests and that nurseries be encouraged to
do the same thing. This would give grow
ers in California a reputation for the
eleunllness of fruit, and the cry raised
abroad that our fresh and dried fruits
are liable to spread disease and pests will
soon disappear and the market for our
products abroad will expand.
Alexander Craw. State Quarantine
Ofllcer. read a lengthy report concerning
work In his department. The subject of
his paper was "Dangerous Pests Quaran
tined by the State Hoard of Horticulture
Stopped at the Threshold." He ask.-d the
fruit-growers of various counties to petl
tion the Supervisors to give all aid pop
elble to the county horticultural commis
sioner, or see t,Jiat such commissioner was
appointed, and such diseases and pests as
they are affected with aro closely
watched.
The committee on legislation, through
Its chairman. Professor C. W. Chllds,
presented v copy of a law that the United
Statfx Congress will be asked to pass to
provide for the inspection and treatment
Â«â ! trees, plants, buds, cuttings, crafts,
Kcions, nursery stocks and fruit imported
Into the United States. It provides for a
Government Inspection at the ports of
â  entry.
The committee on resolutions reported
favorably on the following resolution pre
sented by .M. Theodore Kearney at the
morning .session:
Wherea*. Congress Is about to be railed upon
to consider and approve reciprocity and other
treaties with numerous foreign mates, which
treaties will materially reduce the tariff on
tuuny of the . ling products of this State,
, bucli an dry and ><i>aikiiin{ irlnes, ports, sher
ries, citrus, dried, preserved and fresh fruits,
raisins, nuts, olive oil and beet mcar, which
reductions, of tariff will expose th<-f>- leading
an 1 growing industries to moot unfair and
rulnoui competition; mid
Whereas. It Ik desirable to remind our law
; maker* that in < 'aiif.Tiila tli-Â» l'nlted States
jÂ»>sseÂ«sien a region unetjualed in the world in
the extent and variety of Its natural ri-wiurci-s,

Whereas. In "lew of our KeoKraphlcal posl
tlon and the gr^at jÂ«~MllÂ»illtl.-M of future trade
along the s-liores of the Pacific Ocean the rapid
development of this great wealth is of the ut
most Importance to the HtrenÃth and glory of
the i ail.i i and cannot be successfully carried
on while capital is exjxmed to loss through an
unwise clianKefulness and meddUng with our
tariff laws; and
Wl.ereas. The Republican party and the prea
Â» nt administration lias received the cordtui and
hearty xupnoit Of the iÂ»r>ple of â  allfornia, us

port wan given on our faith in the iirom'.Hes
and pledges of this great party, through it*
leaden und Its press, that all our lndubtrlei
should by tariff leclslatiun receive ample pro
tection, to iti- end that they may be ittlmulated
to their createiit development.
Now, therefore, we, the fruit growers of the
State of California, in convention assembled,
do, with all due respect but tlrmly and ear
nestly, all upon our Sv-nator and our Repre
sentatives In urce upon our honored resident
and uson Cunaiess as a matter of round pol
icy, and demand as a matter of common riitht
and Justice, that no reductions whatever be
mnde or allowed in our present tariff lawn
which will directly or Indirectly reduce the
protection under which we are now working
ami which has broueht us all prevailing and
unexampled prosperity.
Judge Aikcn spoke on the resolution,
stating that the Jamiiionn and other
treaties were a menace tc the fruit m
dustry of California, He said this was
the time for action and arced all to woik
to the end that our representative* <n
Congress t*c that our product* were pro

Similar action was taken with the fol

lily:
Whereas. A bill will be introduced in the
present Congress prohibiting the adulteration
of food product*, and it In notorious that a
very great proportion of the fruit Jellies of
fered for sale are not true to name, and In
many case* do not contain any fruit whatever;
that the adulteration of olive oil is carried on
to m> âºâ ii*nt an extent as to threaten the de-
M ruction of an Important industry of this
State, and that the so-called brick vineyards In
Kuxtern cities are marketing large quantities
of liquids labeled brandy, port, nherry, angel
ica, etc.; which dn not contain a particle of
jrrape ii. â¢â¢. but are eoncm-ted of glucose, sac

which are deleterious to health, fraudulent and

Kesolv.-d. By the fruit growers of the State
of California in convention assembled, 'that we
urgently request of our Senators and our Rep
resentatives to Â»vsiÂ»i by every means In their
power the passage of a bill that can be en
forced in every Htate In the Union which will
promptly put an end to the evils herein com
plained of, and the further evil of the sale of
any articles of food or drink under a false or
fraudulent label.
The resolutions presented at the first
day's session favoring the construction of
the Nicaragua canal, presented by . B.
Berwick, were also adopted.
'â¢Substitutes for Paris Green as In
pecttrldes" was handled by Professor C.
W. Woodworth of Berkeley. He illus
trated his remarks. He said:
Paris green Is practically the only substance
that has been widely and extensively used as
a remedy for the corllin moth. During the past |
few years there- has .been much adulteration
of parls green, and because of this there has
been some failure to obtain uood results. There
are three distinct classes of adulterated parts
greenâ bogus, adulterated and low irrade.
There is danger from arsenical adulterations,
an.i they are injurious to foliage. It has been
demonstrate! that dry parts green can be
placed upon a leaf In any quantity, and so
long as the leaf remains dry no evil results
will follow.
A number of States have laws requiring that

DAN BURNS CANNOT
USE THIS CONVENTION
DAN BT'RN'S 1 agents attempted yesterday to use the League of Pali-
Cornlan Municipalities to assist in their extra-s.-ssi-m scheme. They
tailed wofully, their efforts having Just thÂ»- opposite effect to that
for which they hoped, as the leagu- adopted resolutions against the
proposition* advanced by the touts of the man from Mexico.
The necessity for .1 new street law was urged at the morning session and
a committee was appointed to .suggest amendment* to the statutes. Chair
man Hutchlnson of that Committee was advised early that Paris Kllburn of
ird "f State Harbor Commissioners would be very much pleased if
the league would adopt resolution requesting the Oovernor to call an extra
for the purpose of amending the existing street laws. The same
sunn-.- also advised the chairman of the committee that such a COUTM
would be the must speedy way of remedying the existing defects. When the
met last evening Mr. Hutchlnson, who is evidently not easily footed,
spoke against SUCh action on the part of the organization and introduced
the following resolution, which was adopted unanimously:
"Resolved, That it Is the opinion of this league that it will require at

STREET IMPROVEMENTS
AND CITY WATER WORKS
Delegates to the Convention of Municipalities
Suggest and Discuss Important Measures
for Future Legislation.
CONDEMNATION of the Vrooman
act, suggestion and discussion of ';
measures to supersede It in the I
prosecution of street Improvement
work, ntid consideration of munici
pal ownership Of water works, took up
most of the time yesterday of the dele-
to the League of California Munici
palities In session at Pioneer Hall. Mu
nicipal licenses, public libraries and sani
tary regulations monopolized Interest In
odd Intervals.
As might have been expected from their
methods at other gathering?, the touts of
Dan Mums Intruded their presence within
the vicinity of the convention In an effort
to steal its name to furnish an excuse J
Sufficiently strong to cloak Governor
Gage's real purpose in calling an extra I
SOâ lnn of the Legislature. The admitted
necessity Of v substitute for the Vrooman |
net was their opportunity. They tried to
Influence opinion m the league to put
through a resolution requesting the Gov
ernor to embody m his call for an extra j
session a CUMUM urging its necessity for'
the repeal of the existing street laws. The
attempt was stealthy, but it failed. At
the evening session the trl< k was exposed
and. In retaliation, a resolution was
adopted calling upon the Governor to,
omit, in any call he may make, any ref- :
erence to street law legislation.
Frederick J. Teggart. librarian of the I
Mechanics' Library, briefly outlined the
history of municipal libraries and spoke
of the beneficial Influence they have on
communities where they are maintained.

clouds until it became almost too much of
a good thing. In spite of the downpour,
however, the delegates were early in
their seats In the cozy hall, few ab
sentees being noted. In the absence of
Mayor Phelan the convention was called
to order by the llrst vice president, J. \V.
Richards of Berkeley.
The first paper of the day, under the j
head of "Street Improvement Acts," was
read by W. A. Beasley, City Attorney of
San Jose. It dealt with the question of
taxation for street Improvements. He be
gan with the assumption that the Vroo
man act. condemned the day before by
Mayor Eaton of Los Angeles, was too
technical and cumbersome for practical
use. Before he got through he suggested
a methodâ that met wltn general ap
provalâby which the present obstacles

to street Improvement might be removed.
In presenting his plan Mr. Beasley said:
The most important matter to be con
fldered In th* adoption of street Improve
ment laws is how to WCUII the best result*
with the leant tax upon the property which
mum bear the burden of the Improvement*,
and the apportionment of taxation thux be

we reached our full stature in this respect?
Have we done all that we could for this prin
ciple, rendered to our country all the strength
that was due?
I shall make confession of sins of my own
rellgjous denomination, and quote testimony
from sources that cannot be> suspected of par
tiality to the Catholic church. I do so now
for the purpose of instituting a parallel be
tween other religious denomination*, simply to
â bow that wrong has been done on both sides.
We, the children of those who did -the wrong,
should endeavor by mutual consent to
blot out the memory. The confession I
ul.-li to make Is. that in that past
for Which none of us are responsible,
many In my own denomination greutly sinned
In religious intolerant*, and m used the name
of the church us to bring shame and discredit
up.in the whole body, for there is no tenet of
faith that warrants persecution for religious
opinions or of coercing conscience in religious
.belief. The witnesses called show that sins
of the same nature wen committed likewise
by others, and I quote them solely for their
historical value. I do not here subscribe to
their views other than historical. To an edi
tion of Gulzot's lectures on civilization Is ap
pended a serif* of notes by Rev C. S. Henry,
professor of history and philosophy In the Uni
versity of New York. In his notes Dr. Henry
discusses the contention of the Catholic church
for a teaching authority in matters of faith,
and that of private judgment on the p^rt of
non-Catholics as a cmclcal question between
them. Dr. Henry says:
â  It le the prevalent opinion among us Prot
cMnnts that the KomanlMs are the only ones
who put people to death on account of their
religious opinions. l*r f.Â«tantÂ«i should know
that surh 1* not 1 1.Â»- case." An.] hÂ« quotes
Calvin. Melanchthon. Cranmer and others for
hi* assertion, and gives Fuller. Heylln and Col
lier for historical wit nooses of its truth. He
concludes the note, "From thÂ» study of these
facts â¢â â¢â  readeV nay Judge for himself how fur
the principle of freedom of mind in regard to
religious fiith was recognlred or respected by
the reformers."
Much of this spirit was transplanted from the
Old World to' the new. Kven to the present
day. unless a change has come In the last
five years, no Catholic can hold an office of
honor, trust or profit In Sweden, and In free
America Catholicity alone would practically
disqualify any man for the off!..- of President.
Thnt unhappy spirit wm undoubtedly greatly
due to thÂ«Â» age. In this country certainly It
ought to die once for all In every form. Fair,
manly discussion of principles Is In keeping
with the litter and spirit at our laws. The
Idea of coercion or unfair dealing Is foreign to
our Institutions, Is unworthy of any man that
shelters beneath the flag. Religion Is the
basis of society Most men are convinced of It.
There Is not a doubt that our differences have
done more harm to true religion than any other
single cauÂ«e The only basis of union Is truth,
and truth taught by a divine authority

Proponent of the Measure Desired to

surgents.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 14.â The Senate
to-day by a decisive vote and practically
without discussion laid on the table the
Pettlgrew resolution of Inquiry as to
whether or not the United States forces
had recognized the Filipino insurgents'
flag and had turned over -Spanish Bol
dlers to the Insurgents. It agreed to the
House Christmas recess resolution and
agreed to meet to-morrow to receive re
ports on the 'composition of Its commit
tees for this Congress.
Pettigrew's resolution came up In the
regular ordÂ«-r. Chandler moved to lay the
resolution on the table and refused Pet
tigrew's request to withdraw the motion.
There was, however, no objection to an
explanation by Pettlgrew, and he spoke
briefly, saying that his only purj>ose was
to ascertain whether certain newspaper
statements concerning the recognition
given AKiilnaldo's forces by our f:
Manila Bay In the summer of IS9S wt re
true. He ."aid the statement hod been
made repeatedly that res sell bearing the
Phlhpplne flag ha<l passed in and out of
the liarl>or at that time, and that the flap
had been sainted on different occasion!
by the American forces. He had never
nan a contradiction of this report, and
i nsidered it important to know
whether it was based upon fact. He had
also seen frequent statements to the ef
fect that on one occasion our forces bad
turned over prisoners tnkÂ«Â»n in a battle
on Subig Hay to the Filipinos. If thin
wac true, he anil many others would like
to know the (acts and the circumstances
under which they occurred. He therefore
considered the resolution a proper one,
and honed Chandler's motion to ll B
the table woild not prevail.
Chandler replied thai every word of the
resolution and made upon it
would be cabled to Manila. For this rea
son he hoped that the resolution would
be promptly disposed of.
The motion to lay on the table was car

WASHINGTON. Dec. 14.â The debate on

change of views on the money question
and who It was thought might vote for

'Tis hard to begin at the beginning of

near the head of the class as any other.
Lady Londonderry Couches are nice,

Lamps and Shades; so also Is the cost
of Extension Tables and Sideboards;
And when It comes to Gilt Chairs and
things of sweet complexion for Christ-

on Sixteenth and Mission streets and
the branch store in San Jose will do
the running far in the lead of anything
in the Furniture and Carpet business

Who fears to speak of Rory O'More?
Three hundred of those inimitable

They cost nearly double to make.
Chiffoniers are nice presents. No hand-

Chamber Music Concert.
The fifth chamber music concert of the
Holmes Quartet occurred at Century Hall
Monday night. Th* programme was rath
rr a tedious one in the beginning, consist
ing of the Haydn string quartet In F. Op.
77. and the Brahms sonata in G. Op. 78. for
piano and violin. Mrs. Ernestine Goldman
played the piano part of the sonata with
delicacy of execution, and Henry HolmeÂ«
showed himprlf once more i he master of
tjic violin which he undoubtedly is. The
brilliant piece of the evening was the
Schumann Ft ring quartet in A minor No
1. Op. 41. Especially piquant was the
presto movement, which at times con
tained that quiet humor which Schumann
understands so well how tar obtain, and
again this merry "fun" gave place to sad
sentiments nnd repressed sorrow. It in an
emotional composition of the most refined
character and was worth while to stay
fon The laÂ«t concert of this series will
take place next Tuesday afternoon.

The Society for the Prevention of Cru

wild young specimen of femininity. She
was discovered by Officer McMurray run
ning at large at Ocean View and taken to
the office of the society, where Colonel
Parneii, the secretary. quizzed her as to
her mode of living and antecedents. The
girl is called I.illU- Young, but her true
name Is Wise, and her age is about 15. Her
father is dead and her mother Is believed
to hi In Eureka, i'al. For some time past
Mrs. Young of. .'.]:> Capitol avenue has had
charge of the child, who she says is by
no means bad. The child's peculiarities
are that she la particularly fond of shoot
ing ducks on Lake Merced with a bhot
gun, boxing with the men and boys at tho
â porting resorts In that section of the
city and riding horseback after the man
ner of an Indian.
Colonel Parnell found that the child is
very or!nht and able to protect ).â 
In fact, the girl boa*ts that she has fre
quently knocked down men and boys v*no

straight kk .in arrow and as muscular as
an athlete, and the colonel Is Impressed
that the only fault of the girl Is that she
is a "tomboy" and loves a wild life hn

age ufurlK seek. He will provide her
with a home and endeavor to have her
tum'-d a little.

CHURCH HOUSE WARMING.
St. Paulus Evangelical Lutheran
Congregation Celebrated Com
pletion of Pastor's Residence.
A housewarmlng took place last evening
at the newly completed pastoral residence
of the St. Paulus Evangelical Lutheran
Church, at Gough and Eddy streets. The
pastor, the Rev. J. M. Buehler. welcomed
the congregation and trustees and all
friends of the congregation, who. In large
numbers, thronged the house during the
entire evening. After the older members
had been received the young people were
given a reception. The event was really
In the nature of a celebration, but very
informal. The house is largely due to
the energy and perseverance of the La
dies' Society connected with the church.
There was a vacant lot adjoining the
church structure, which was the property
of the church. There was nothing to pre
vent the building of the pastoral residence
there excepting the lack of funds. The
Ladies' Society took the matter up and
raised enough money so that when the
building was completed It was free from
debt. Therefore, the praise of the ladies
was the theme of conversation last even
ing on the part of the guests. There was
no set programme of exercises. The
people gathered around the tables and
listened to Impromptu speeches, and mu
sic was also a part of the entertainment.
The pastoral residence is two stories high
and Is quite handsome and commodious.

FILIPINO THEATRICAL
STARS SUFFER ECLIPSE
A DREAM OF LUXURY DISSI
PATED BY LACK OF FUNDS.
Ti-oubles of Manager Stone in At-
tempting to Obtain Oratuitious
Accommodation.
Manager "Colonel" Walter Everett
Stone and his constellation of Filipino
stars are having a literal run for their
moneyâ or, rather, for their promises.
They have not yet been In the city a good
half-week and have been run out of the
Palace Hotel and Russ House, and are
now running about the streets looking for
some other place to go rest their heads.
Stone, or, as he styles himself. "Col
onel," drifted across the local ilrmament
last Sunday evening for the first time,
when he wandered Into the Palace Hotel
and casually informed the clerk that he
wanted accommodation for himself, fam
ily and some thirty Filipino friends, irre
spective of what it cost or who was hurt.
The management of the hotel was some
what dubious. Mr. Kirkpatrick did not
care what it cost, but he most certainly
did care who was hurt, and was at llrst
disinclined to take any chances of being
the injured party. Stone, however, waved
his hands two or three times in front of
Klrkpatrick's whiskers, snapped his fin
gers in his ears, told him unit he was
looking at a millionaire manager of the
only aggregation of Filipino comets that
had ever flashed across the California
horizon and that he should give the all
star troupe, who were so. soon to delight
the crowned heads of Europe at the Parts
Exposition, the best he had on the first
floor of his hostelry-
Manager Kirkpatrick went Into a trance
and obeyed. The little brown men were
quartered in the best apartments that the
house had to offer, they were given the
choicest cuts and the most expensive
dishes that the hostel's chef cquid pro
duce and Austin was told to tout them
onto a few good things at Tanforan, so
that they would not wear themselves out
carrying too large a roll around in their
clothes. â¢ â¢â â 
The Filipinos liked It. They had struck
nothing half so good In all their lives
before; not even when, as untutored chil
dren of the wilderness, they plundered
packtrains and murdered the casual Span
; ish soldier in the holy cause of liberty.
Stone swelled himself like a toad, strutted
! about telling of the wonderful things he
was going to accomplish and of the favor
he was conferring on the Palace Hotel by
his patronage, which was soon to be in
creased by a further addition of ten Fili
pinos who had not yet arrived.
This dream of Stone and his following
lasted but for a brief space. Last Thurs
day some one put a flea in the ear of Mr.
Kirkpatrick, and that gentleman at once
Informed Stone that a $1000 deposit would
I make his credit better at the caravansery.
"A thousand," said Stone; "that's easy.
You shall have it at noon. Noon came,
but no money. The Filipinos started on
their regular march for the grill, but
never got there. As soon as they ap
peared out of their rooms Manager Kirk
patrick marshaled his forces and the war
, riors from Luzon were dumped, bag and
! baggage, out on the sidewalk.
Stone got them together, and in columns
of fours they marched to the Huns House,
where the same gold brick was presented
and accepted. They were given rooms
and one meal, and then Manager Young
got wise.' He called Stone to one side and
Informed that gentleman that while he
was willing to accept the white man's
! burden he was not In the business for his
health, and that the burden must be paid
for or he would dump It. Stone promised
to get the money by the middle of the
afternoon, but, as in the former case, he
failed to keep his promise.
Colonel Young thereupon followed the
example of Mr. Klrkpatrick and placed
the Antlpodeans on the cold, cruel pave,
where they now are and where they will
probably remain unless Stone, who has
not shown up, appears and finds some
way to relieve them from their embar
rassment.

CITIZENS AFTER

Larkspur Residents on

WATER RATES TOO HIGH
MARIN SUPERVISORS ASKED TO
REGULATE PRICES.
*
A Technicality Causes the Petition
to Be Thrown Out, but An
other Will at Once Be
Prepared.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Deo. 14.â The trouble be
tween C. W Wright, president of the
American Land and Trust Company of
Larkspur, and the patrons of that corpo
ration has almost reached a climax. In
stead of adopting a less belligerent atti
tude upon finding that the courts gener
ally favored the people of the town,
Wright has pursued the even tenor of his
way with the regularity of the ticking of
an eight-day dock, and in consequence
the residents of Larkspur have appealed
to the Supervisors to fix a time for regu
lating and controlling the prices of the
water dispensed by Wright, who Is really
the "corporation. "
This petition, which is signed by thirty
two persons, recites that the American
Land and Trust Company Is a corporation
controlling the water supply of Larks
pur and has been engaged in business tor
four years; that prior to April l, I;>2*>, the
prices of the corporation were controlled
ny an agreement entered into wit 1 , its
patrons, Dut thai in March, IM*5, Wright
notified the patrons that the company
would, after April 1, demand its own
prices. The petitioners aver their belief
that such prices are extortionate and
greatly in excess of what would be al
lowed "by law, and accordingly ask that
the. Board of Supervisors regulate the
amounts to be paid by residents and
householders.
The board submitted the petition to Dis
trict Attorney Mclsaac for examination.
To-day thai ofllclal handed In an opinion
that the petition should be rejected for
the rxuKon that fewer than twenty-five
of the signers were taxpayers and their
manes were not on the assessment roll.
This defect will probably be remedied Im
mediately and a n>-w petition presented.
If the petition Is properly signed the Su
pervisors are required by law to name a
day on which the prices of water in va
rious quantities shall be fixed so as to
allow the company to make only a certain
percentage of pn.ni on Its Investment.
TO REVISE CITY ORDINANCES.
Sity Attorney Knocks Out the Aspi
ration of Three Attorneys.
The Board of Supervisors recently re
ferred to City Attorney l^ine for his ppin
lon a resolution under which It In proposed
to employ three members of the bar to
revise the ordinances of this city and
county to conform to the requirements of
the new charter. In his opinion Mr. l^ane
'The work proposed under this resolu
tion would be of muÂ«h value to the city
If it were well done. It would be useless
and worse if poorly done. Inasmuch as
the incoming Board of Supervisors Will
contain several attorneys, who will no
doubt constitute the Judiciary Committee
of fÂ»sild board, it would be in the line of
economy for * l "' n work a.s is immediately
necessary because of the new charter to
be undertaken by such committee. The
work of codillcation and general revision
could then wait until the city was better
able to pay for it than it is at present."
Tlii* knocks out the applications of
GeorK** 0. BQ.utrÂ«*j L. <J. Carpenter and
A S. Newburgh, who made application
before the Health and Police Committee
to be appointed special counsel to amend
the city ordinance.
Rev. Dr. Spalding to Retire.
The x>resent condition of Rev. Dr. Ed
ward H. Spalding. pastor of St. John's
Bjttscopal Church, on Fifteenth street. Is
such as to foreshadow his early retire
mtnt from the ministry. The church and
congregation over which Dr. Spalding
has charge is of such magnitude tnat an
active and energetic minister will be re
quired to conduct the interests and w-1
fare of both. While the many friends of
l)r Spaldlng will be pleased to learn that
he has improved' wonderfully since he
wont \>> Sun Mater County to recuperate,
yet his ape and the wonderful strain
which his mind has been subject to in hm
trying to conduct the school and the cler
ical responsibilities' of his large parish
have uiiiii rmined his general constitution
to the extent that his withdrawal from
the active duties of both is now an as
sured conclusion.
The lay officers of St. John's will In all
probability make arrangements, with the
consent of the congregation, by which 1 >r.
Spalding will be retired as an emeritus
In the near future. The question of who
will be honored with the rectorship of this
prosperous and growing parish Is not at
the present time known. It may be that
the deacons will reauest Bishop Nichols
to appoint a rector direct fr<;m the num
ber of his clergy in the diocese.

RADGESKY ACTED
AS ADVISOR FOR
D. V. B. HENARIE
The Widow Has Filed
Suit.
VALUABLE STOCK THE OBJECT
SAYS HER HUSBAND PRETEND
ED TO TRANSFER IT.
She Claims, However, That He Wai
Under the Undue Influence of
the Man She Names as
Defendant.
Mary A. Henarle. who escaped mention
In the will of her late husband. D. V. B.
Henarie, the well-known liquor dealer,
has sued Louis D. Radgesky to recover
possession of stock In the Eastern Oregon
Land Company valued at $20,000, which
she alleges belongs to decedent's estate.
In her complaint Mm. Henarle alleges
that when she married her husband on
December 24, I\'.4. he had no property or
means of any kind, but since that date
he acquired property valued at over $1,-
COO.OOO.
Mrs. Henarie alleges that on February
9 last, Henarle, without consideration. In
dorsed the shares of stock sued for and
conveyed them to Radgesky a* a pretend
ed gift, without the consent of the plaint
iff to her irreparable Injury and damage.
Hence she prays that the court restrain
the defendant from transferring the
stoc'*: that he be compelled to account
for I. if profit of the stock and reconvey it
to the plaintiff. );;'i
In an accompanying affidavit Mrs.
Henarie complains that for nix or seven
years prior to her husband's death he was
"weak and sick and entirely under the
control and dominion of Radgesky," who
"by hiH machinations and wicKed and Ille
gal and unlawful acts so unduly influ
enced and controlled the mind of the de
ceased that he had no power or will to
do anything In business, except as the de
fendant might direct him. During this
period in which Raitgesky so exercised
this control the deceased could not and
would not accept any social recognition
from his friends unless he tlrst obtained
Ha<lKi'skv's permission, and consequently
the defendant estranged and alienated all
the friends of Henarie."
Continuing Mrs. Henarie says that
"Radgesky, to further carry out the ne
farious scheme to enrich himself at the
expense of the community property of the
marriage, caused old employes of
Henarie s in the business to be discharg
ed and would not allow other employes to
talk to the deceased or be with him under
a penalty of dismissal from such employ
ment." __,
EAGLES AT THE ORPHETTM.
Emonds and Emerson Given a Sur
prise by Local Members of the
Order.
Two hundred and fifty San, Francisco
Eagles Invaded the Orpheum last even
ing and occupied the front seats, where
they waited for the cue'- to turn .them
selves loose. It was a nice little surprise
party arranged by the local member* of
the order for the benefit of two stray
eaglets from Chicago who are doing a
turn at the Orpheum, and the cue came
with the appearance of Emonds. Emer
son and Emonds In their farce, "Only a
Joke. , 'â '
Then the surprise was sprung, and the
outsiders among the spectators were Im
mediately aware that there was "some
thing doing." but Just what it was they
had no means of knowing.- However.
Emerson and Emonds were not slow to
realize that there was another "Joke" in
the house, and they put the audience next
by a cleverly worded reference to a
striking floral eagle, presented by the
local Eagles. â¢
That sealed it. The Eagles on the stage,
aided and abetted by Mrs. Emonds, put
forth their best efforts to repay the
Eagles In the audience for being present,
and the latter responded by keeping up a
whirlwind of applause, which proved In
fectious, as the entire audience was soon
applauding and laughing In the enjoy
ment of both the surprise and the per
formance. This exuberance of mirth did
not cease with the departure from the
stage of the actor Eagles, but continued
throughout the remainder of the even
ing. After the performance the two
Chicago Eagles were taken to a popular
cafe and given a real Bohemian banquet
which lasted until late hours. .
Civil War Veterans.
At a meeting of ttm Veterans of the
Civil War, held last "Wednesday night at
125 Eddy street, Martin Murray, the pre
siding officer, explained that the meet-
Ing was called for the purpose of taking
action in regard to what he declared was
discrimination by heads of departments
against veterans who had been appointed
or are eligible under the United States
civil service rules. The meeting was ad
dressed by John Wiggins on this subject,
and he made charges of discrimination
as to veterans by a foreman . named Sar
gent, employed In the department of
yards and docks at Mare Island.
Several others spoke on the subject and
resolutions were adopted requesting the
abolishment of the civil service rules as
now carried out as being detrimental to
the Interests of the veterans, or that they
be so modified as to carry out the bene
fits which Congress decided should ac
crue to those who served in the Civil
War. A copy of the resolution will be
forwarded to California's delegation in

Worrying the Fishermen.
A few weeks ago Deputy Fish Commla-
sloner John Davis and the crew of the
Commission launch made a run in the
upper waters of the bay and confiscated
several hundred dollars' worth of stur
geon gear prohibited by law. The fisher
men were not discouraged at their lost,
but at once bought another lot. Word
was received yesterday at the office of
the Commission that Davis had seised
thirty-nine sections of sturgeon lines and
eleven anchors in Suisun Bay. off Rue
Island, also thirty sections and ten an
chors near Marsh Landing. The confis
cated gear must have cost no leaa than
$700.

IMPROVING OAKLAND.
OLAND seems about to embark upon cer
-ucrpnses to make the best use
clous natural advantages oi her
ity for a large amount is always a se
er, and due care should be taken that it is
good and that any element of

:ssue should make ample provision for
which draws to the best advantage for
I
tbe < -editions there are such that a
variety and benefit may
be ea- <i.
In the first place that city needs an ample park
area, well improved, at what has aptly been called her
"front door." The West Oakland marsh land, long
an eyesore, is capable of transformation into a beauti
ful field of sward and shrubbery that will at once at
tract the eye of every incoming traveler. Its influence
upon the prosperity and growth of the city will be
Rrcatr- than almost anything else that the public can
provide. There is no other city on the coast that has
the facilities for an equally beautiful park and
pleasure-ground exhibited to the eyes of all travelers
who approach or pass it Then in Lake Mcrritt Oak
land has already a water park of singular beauty. If
surrounded by a wide boulevard and connected with
the West Oakland Park by I well ornamented street
the two would make a park system matchless in
ever}' beauty and facility which parks can supply. If
a foothiil park be added, so located as to make a
complete chain, connected by ample driveways, we
do not hesitate to say that Oakland may rest in the
conviction that she overmatches all cities on the con
tinent in her park facilities as an inducement to the
best claÂ«s of residents.
NÂ° ri to neglect improrement of all
mities to attract residents. Commercial
value, certainly, but men of commerre
trade for the profits which will procure the
domestic comforts which make life pleasant. By the
provision of such a lyrtesi of parks Oakland will

Around us in the valleys and above us in the
mountains are thousand* of men delring hard for for

of a home in some pleasant place where the families
they toil for may have even,' advantage of health,
iety. Having the means to live where
- motive, lead them, they are free seekers, and.
when they find, are valuable members of the com
munity.
With what Ac may now provide Oakland will
easily become the favorite residence city of the coast,
and with such increase in her population as will come
the may not long remain behind any other in the
volume of her commerce We know of no other di
rection in which she can make a public effort of equal
advantage to her and to the State. Fortunately its
accomplishment u4 the rucce:s wLlv.li Â»ill fallow Â«f
entirely in her own control. No rival can bar her nor
hinder the effort, and none can take away the sure
results which will follow.
Munlcrpal officials in all parts of California receive
much more abuse than praise, and yet the personnel
and the proceedings of the Municipal League con
vention in this city show that we have really a set of
municipal officials of whom any State might be proud

THE COST OF WAR.
\A ANY estimates have been made of the
/ \ economic losses of war. Nearly all the great
â¢ national debts have been created by war.* So
large have many of these debts become that the pay
ment of the principal has been abandoned and only
the interest is taken care of in the annual budget. The
debt of England is almost entirely a war debt, and
every campaign adds to it. Her present aggression
against the South African republics has cost $50,000,
000, which is added to her burdens as a permanent
charge upon her people, and it may easily cost many
times that sum before she enjoys peace with honor
in the Dark Continent. All the other European na
tions are groaning under war debts and the annual
charge of armaments, which yearly increase in their
weight and cost.
The United. States is the only country that has un
dertaken to pay off a war debt. The cost of our Civil
War left nearly two billions of debt upon us. This
had steadily declined until it fell below the billion
line and its extinction seemed to be in sight. But
now the national debt has turned and has risen above
that line, and how far it may go in the wrong direc
tion no one can foresee.
An examination of this country's balance-sheet
wi!l enlighten the taxpayer upon the cost of war. Ths
total income of the United States treasury for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1899, was $610,982,004 35.
The total outgo for the same period was $700,093,
564 02, leaving a deficit of $89,111,559 67, which of
course must be made up by taxation.
When the expenditures are dissected the war cost
. comes into startling prominence. Of the whole ex
penditure $403,075,212 81 went for war, including the
pension payment. This left only $207,018,351 81 to be
I expended for the ordinary, proper purposes of civil
' government. The total outstanding national debt
â >87.094,427 92, the. highest point reached since
1882. For twenty-one years prior to the beginning
'â  <if the Spanish war Feder.il taxation had varied from
>4 50 to $5 50 per head of population. The taxation
j per capita in 1898 was $4 56, and the expenditure
iIS 9Â«5 per capita. For the fiscnl year ending June 30,
j iftio. the taxation was $6 54 and the expenditure
$r 95 per capita.
Under the Hayes administration the per capita ex
penditure was from $4 9S to $5 46; under Arthur it
was $4 63 to $4 94; under Cleveland's first term it
was $4 22 to $4 88; under Harrison it was $5 07 Â»o
$5 73', under Cleveland's second term it began at
-. fell to $4 93 and closed at $5 01. The average
under those five Presidential terms was $4 97. This
has risen now, due to war expenditures solely; to $7 95
in the last fiscal year, with a prospect of going still
higher before our military troubles are over.
In view of its cost even- effort to hinder the out
break of war should deserve the sympathy of tax
payers in every country. The expense comes finally
out of the substance of the people and is not offset,
as a rule, by any compensating benefit.
THE MUNICIPALITIES CONVENTION
SECRETARY MASON'S report of the work
accomplished by the League of Californian
Municipalities during the past year affords
ample grounds for supporting, high expectations of
even better work in the year to come. The attend
ance upon the league convention has been excep
tionally good. The gathering is not only large, but
i is thoroughly representative of the progressive muni
; cipalities of the State, and the tone of the proceedings
shows an earnest desire to bring about among the
â  cities of the State that cordial co-operation which is
essential to the best results.
cry step in municipal progress under our sys
| tern of government has to be preceded by a campaign
i of education for the purpose of convincing the peo
! pie of the benefits to be derived from it. Not until
I a majority of the voters in any instance, and very
frequently not until two-thirds of them, have been
brought to understand the value of improvements
[ can anything of an extensive nature be undertaken.
That fact renders the educational work of municipal
politics an important feature in our government, and
tzixes a hiph value to whatever aids it. The work of
the League of Municipalities is distinctly beneficial
iin that way. The present convention, for example,
even if it do no more, will at least have the effect of
directing public attention to municipal problems and
thus prepare the way for a better understanding of
them when they arise in any issue of local develop
ment.
As was well said by Mayor Snow of Oakland in
i rpeaking of the future work of the league: "Less
knowledge of municipal affairs than we as officers
piMWM would make pessimists of us all. Public
opinion is so slow to be won. misunderstanding of
the real intent of municipal legislation is so common,
i it is of the greatest importance that the citizen be
! informed of the successful efforts of other cities be
j fore he gives up in despair for his own." That work
of instruction the league is carrying out with marked
I success. There can be no doubt that improvement in
j one city tends to encourage officials elsewhere to
| emulate the example, and when the co-operation of
j a strong body of official support is given such efforts
; have a much better chance of success than would
otherwise attend them. That support is assure i
{ through the league, and every municipality in Cali
; fornia has reason to give thanks to the enterprising
: and public-spirited officials who have promoted it
I and are making it more and more widely useful.
A NEW IDEA FROM KANSAS.
\A ANY resolutions providing for amendments
/ \ to the constitution will be submitted at this
session of Congress, but there is only one
thus far announced which has sufficient charm to
make it- thrilling to San Francisco. That happy
thought in the way of an amendment originated in
the mind of Reeder of Kansas. It provides that Con
gress shall meet alternately in the East and in the
Westâ that during one year the seat of government
shall be cast of the Mississippi and during the next
year it shall be somewhere in the West.
I >:' course if the Government is to come far enough
West to balance Washington City it must come to
Sao Francisco. It could not stoo half nÂ« Â«â¢;â¦Â»,Â«,.Â»
doing mjattke to the amendment and to the country.
The matter could be arranged so as not to conflict
with State affairs, and we could thus have the Legis
lature in session one winter and Congress in session
next winter, and everything would be harmonioui
and serene.
It has been repeatedly averted hy the press of 803
' on. New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore that Con
r.-c^s neglects the Atlantic seaboard and gives nearly
all of its attention and appropriations to the West It
is argued that this is due to the fact that Congressmen
beim: familiar with the Eastern States, hare become
indifferent to them, while the imaginations of the
statesmen are excited by thoughts of the unfamiliar
boundless West, and they vote any amount of money
to improve Western rivers and adorn Western cities
with public buildings.
That being so. it will be of great advantage to the
Atlantic coast to have Congress meet every other
THE PAN TP A3Sf CISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1899.
year in this city, from which point it can take a
birdseye view of .Bosto'i and treat that neglected
place with the consideration which has hitherto been
accorded to San Francisco.
Xor will the benefits be confined wholly to the At
lantic coast towns. Congrc?s it?clf will benefit in
the change of air and of view. Hardly anything
could give our public officials more gratification in
their work or more encourage them in thei
labors for the public than for the whole governmental
body, from the President to the clerks of committees,
to come out here and behold the stately ' Federal
building and other vast public works the Govern
nicnt has undertaken here. Mr. Reeder of Kansas v
a Sunflower statesman with a head on him, and it is
to be hoped his proposed amendment will not be lost
in a pigeon-hole.
TELEPHONE SLOT MACHINES
\A AVOR PHELAN in addressing the conven
/ \ tion of the League of Californian Municipali
ties referred to the tax problems which will
confront San Francisco under the new charter and
advocated an increase of the taxes upon licenses.
In the course of his remarks he is reported to have
said: "We have 10,000 nickel-in-the-slot telephone
machines in this city which, if properly taxed, would
yield the city a revenue of from $50,000 to $60,000
annually."
The Mayor'? estimate was given in. round numbers
and underrates the revenue that might be derived in
the way raj At a recent consideration of the
subject by the License Committee of the Board of
Supervisors the testimony given showed there arc
about 11,000 nickel-in-the-slot telephones operated
in San Francisco. If there were levied upon
these an adequate tax the income to the municipality
would go far toward making up the deficit in license
taxes which will otherwise follow from the adoption
of the new charter.
The present Board of Supervisors has already
taken steps toward the imposition of the desired tax.
A resolution to that etTect was introduced some time
ago. That resolution, as was pointed out by The Call
yesterday, has been delayed upon one pretext or
another until this time. It is now in the hands of
City Attorney Lane, to whom it was referred for a
report upon its validity. Mr. Lane cannot be ignor
ant of the fact that the telephone company is seek
ing delay, nor of the further fact that the delay has
reached a point where it has become dangerous.
The term of the present board will soon expire, and
from every point of view it is desirable that his re
port be filed in time for the Supervisors to take final
action at their meeting on Monday.
In addition to imposing the license tax the resolu
tions as introduced contained the further excellent
provision that the telephone employes should make
the switch desired before requiring the patron of the
line to drop the nickel in the slot. Und^r the present
system of doing business the company plays the
"gouge game" upon the public, for frequently after
the nicicel lias been dropped in the slot and is beyond
recovery, the patron is told the line is engaged, the
party is not in, to come back another time, or given
some other impertinence in exchange for his money.
If he persist in demanding his rights the "buzzer" is
turned upon him and he has no recourse.
The resolutions now before the board are then
doubly commendable by reason of the fact that they
provide for protecting the patron as well as for im
posing a license tax upon the company. If these reso
lutions be returned in time their passage can be relied
upon, for the present Board of Supervisors has
proven itself faithful to the interests of the people and
has made a high record for efficiency in office. Upon
Mr. Lane, therefore, rests the responsibility of the sit
uation. Secretary Eaton, to whom the company has
entrusted the management of its fight, will lay his
conduits and provide free wires to back yards in vain.
Such at any rate is the outlook, and if Mr. Lane de
lays to make his report in time for the board to act.
the people will know whom to blame.
POPULAR INTEREST AROUSED.
rOR many years students of American politics
have been agreed that much of the evil of muni
cipal administration and the comparative lack of
progress in the way of improvement have been due
to a neglect of local affairs by business men and tax
payers generally. That San Francisco has suffered
from that defect of citizenship in the past is not to
be disputed, but fortunately the outlook at present
gives promise of better things. The earnestness with
which citizens of all clas?es have entered upon the
work of the campaign for the proposed bond issujs
shows' that popular interest in these important local
measures has been aroused, and there are now sound
reasons for the sanguine hope that at each election
the necessary two-thirds vote will be cast on the side
of progress and improvement.
The objections urged against the plan of park ex
tension have been met fairly and thoroughly refuted.
It has been made clear to the taxpayers that the
amount of money required for the improvements will
be small in comparison with the benefits sure to be
derived from the completed work; that the entire
sum raised for the extension will be expended for
home labor and home material and will therefore re
turn at once to the channels of local trade; that the
additional park area to be provided will serve the
poor even more than the rich, and benefit pedestrians
as much as those who have command of horses and
carringes; and that the amount of grading to be done
will not injure the surrounding property nor entail
an unreasonable expenditure of money.
Since the campaign of education on the subject be
gan there has been shown continuously a gratifying
evidence of popular support in every district of the
city. The various improvement clubs organized for
local work have cordially combined for co-operation
in promoting the new movement that is to benefit
the whole city, and along with them has come to the
aid of the movement all that great body of progres
sive citizens who have noted the good work of the
improvement clubs in the past and are willing to
sustain them in the enterprises of the future.
There will never come to San Francisco an oppor
tunity more favorable to improvement than that
which we nowL enjoy. It is fairly certain that never
in future years would the city be able to purchase the
land required for the park extension so cheaply as at
present, and it is therefore a matter of wise economy
to make the investment now. Moreover, the city has
had a year of prosperity and looks forward to another
year of even greater business activity. It will be easy
for the taxpayers to bear the taxes required to meet
the interest on the bonds and orovide the sinking
fund, and the burden will be made the lighter by
reason of the fact that the increased work caused by
the improvements will provide wages fo/ laboring
men and help to spread the blessing of prosperity
into the homes of all.
San Frnncisro is to he "a continuing city." to use
President Jordan*! phrase, and will advance steadily
fr-rward in every branch of municipal development.
Such, at any rate, is the promise of the new era made
evident by the popular interest now taken in the
pending questions of public improvement.

How and where the strawberry derived its

believed that the plant derives its name
from the resemblance of its runners to

the culture of strawberries, which can be
obtained through any first class book

PIGEONS-R. M. 8.. Oolden Gate Pal
To raise pigeons for profit they should be
well fed and also given liberty. To can
tine them in an aviary Is not always foT
the best For the profitable ko.pin* of
pigeons It Is necessary to have a prop
erly constructed dovecote divided Into
, cells, a cell for each pair, each cell 1*
Inches broad by 12 from back to front ant
the door toward one side so that the n^i
may not be seen from without. There
must "be a slip of wood In front of each
cell for the birds to sit and coo on. The
dovecote must be frequently cleaned,
otherwise it may probably be deserted by
its occupants. It ought to be painted
white, that color being very attractive to
pigeons and lessening the difficulty of re
taining them when n new dovecote Is es
tablished. Pigeons begin to breed at the
age of nine months and breed every
month, except hi cold -weather. Any
tlrst-class bookseller can procure for you
I books on pigeons.
STAGE FEVER-L. 0.. City. You seem
t'. have the staxe fever very bad. If you
have, as you write, "strong dramatic tal
ent, but only a common school educa
tion," would suggest that you devote a
portion of your time to the study of the
English language. Then do as did a great
many actors who became prominent-
Frank Mayo, for Instance. Go behind the
scenes, assist the property man, carefully
watch the actors and actresst-s who are
learned in their art, become conversant
with all the little tricks of the profes
sion, take small parts, such as that of
lackey and repeat the lines, "My lord, the
carriage waits." but do it well, and In the
course of time you will have an opportuni
ty t" assume more difficult roles, and if
you have that dramatic talent you believe
you have It will make itself manifest.
Then you may some day shine as a great
star. You must not think that because
you can recite a soliloquy from Shake
speare you are a natural-born actor.
Learn first to be a basket boy, supe and
tant property man and If you are
destined to be an actor it will not be many
years before managers will discover that
fact.'

goods seem to be to the liking of tho
Japanese experts, for the orders continue
to come across the. ocean by every
steamer, and the quantities Font out are
larger and larger. The Held in Japan for
California malt being new. the totals of
the sales so far. represented by dollars,
would not make a very Imposing show
ing, as a matter of course, but the let
ters that are received and the news
brought home by Californlans who have
traveled recently in Japan lead the malt
makers to tUink that they have discov
ered a market of future real commercial
value. A gentleman connected with one
of the local houses furnishing brewers'
supplies related the facts yesterday as
far as he knew about them. 'Hie busi
ness, so he said, ha.- ijepun since the
Philippine war. and dates back not cry
far. why the Philippine trouble should
attract Japanese brewers to the malt
made in California he could not explain.
but he naturally entertained the view
that this Is pimply an indication of the
greater attention this port Is attracting;
all over th*Â» world, which la manifested
by the preparations making in many quar
ters to extend shipping facilities. Â».._;
The English probably have had a good
share of the Japan trade heretofore, along
with their commercial rivals, the Ger
mans. California barley that was used
In the malt firM traveled over two oceans
to Ret to England and was there pre
pared for the Oriental market. There has
been no reason for this that was evident,
except that the California product of malt
was seemingly unknown directly to the
Japanese. Since the commercial travelers
and commercial agentp of California have
Invaded Japan on their respective mis
sions, the even of the Japanese have been
opened and the manufacturers of this
State have also seen some thlnw with
which they were previously unacquainted.
The local breweries' supply houses peo
ple now think that there may also be a
chance to do some business not long
hence .in China and in Australia, and let
ters are going forward and the field is
undergoing strict scrutiny In a trade way.
No IlKurcs are obtainable as to the ex
tent that the recently acquired Oriental
trade for brewers' supplies has reached.
It Is well known, however, that there are
quite large orders going forward in the
near future. The California barley Is all
that could be desired for the making of
malt, as the large export to foreign coun
tries has demonstrated during a series of
years. The facilities arc all here for tho
building up of a larÂ«".-> industry that could
hold Its own, for here Is th- capacity for
producing all the raw material that the
larpest possible demand eouli require;
alpo all the facilities for manufacturing
and the additional and very Important
condition of sea rates for transportation
to Japan. China and Australia. A mar
ket is also expected to develop in the
Philippine Islands whenever the condi
tions become sufficiently settled to per
mit the thorough commercial exploitation
of the country.

QUESTION OF PROGRESSION,
NOT ONE OF A BOWL OF PUNCH
THK question of New Year calls and the punch-bowl that has thrown
select Oakland Into a willing fever has failed to c-ven ruffle the calm
and even tenor "f local MKtety. Once before Oakland got excited and the
result was their brill and beaux were forced to cool their parched
throats, after a dance, at the lcewater pitcher. Then. also, the swell
pot on thin side of the bay looked on. smiled and held Its own counsel.
San Kran< v continued to dance and drink Its punch.
The question of New Y.ar calls has fallen Into obscurity In our sister
city In comparison to the question of New Year punch. When the question
X the revival of the nil- New Years customs was presented to the local
matrons no thought was Riven to the punchâ all the discussion hovered
round the ancient cuptom <.f making one's friends and acquaintances welcome
on the first day of the year. Local society is above all things progressive
and the majority of opinions expressed the idea that we go forward and not
backwardâ not even In reviving social customs, no matter how delightful
they might be.
As for tne punch there was but one side to that question. In the words
ofÂ« the old vicar, all concluded that "that virtue which needs ever to be
guarded is scarcely worth the sentinel."
Mr-. Samuel O. Buckbee had not given the question of New Year calls
and the etceteras that go with It any serious thought. "I don't believe."
she said, "that we want It. though. It Is vlllagey and we are a big city. As
for the punch"â and here phe made a fetching moveâ "l trust my friends."
Mrs Wendell Kaston Is of the opinion that society can't be too up-to
date. With the la'ly it is not a question of "calls" and "punch-bowl." it Is
the question of establishing new century customs. "We want to go ahead,"
said Mrs. Easton. "We have outgrown that old custom. Don't let us go
backward."
Mrs. Southard Hoffman really didn't care one way or the other. To her It
was a matter of perfect Indifference whether the custom was revived or not.
"I will not receive on New Years." she said. "1 have not thought about the
matter at all. and I don't think it requires any thought."
Miss Carrie <Â»wln. in her big-hearted way. expressed her love for old
social customs and refused to even dwell on the punch-bowl phase, "I should
love to see tho custom revived," the lady exclaimed. "I have always lov^d
the old custom. As for the question of the punch-bowl, I think it an injustice
to my friends to give it a thought."
Mrs. Eleanor Martin was also in favor of the custom of other days. The
hospitality for which the lady is noted was made manifest In her words.
"Ye*," she said. "I should like to see the* custom revived. I believe in any
and all customs that make friends meet."
Mr?. Pelham Ames was not in favor of reviving the old hospitable New
Tear day. "We have grown out of it," she said. "To my way of thinking
the objectionable feature of the old custom Is not the punch, but the many
objectionable people who were wont to take advantage of open-house. Per
sonally. I lÂ«*an toward temperance," the lady concluded. "I should not offer
punch nor any beverage that contained whisky, but I should certainly offer
wine."
Mrs. E. W. McKinstry was also Imbued with the spirit of progression. "I
would not care to pee the custom revived," she said. "We have outgrown it.
And then, again, to-day we have more acquaintances than friends to make
the old custom practical ."
Mrs. E. B. I'ond hoped to see a custom she characterized as "delightful"
revived. "It was a dellÃhtful custom." the lady said, "and I hope to see it
revived. I am always glad to see my friends. As for refreshments, let them
take what they willâ l should leave that to their own discretion."
THE PAN FKANCTSCO CALL. FHIPAY, BECEMnF.H 15. 189!).
EASTERN STAR OFFICERS INSTALLED.
MRS. EMMA CARTER AND MRS. JOHN TONNINGSEN OF
HARMONY CHAPTER.
THE disagreeable weather last evening did not keep the many friends of
the members of Harmony Chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star
from Oolden Gate Hall, where the officers-elect were Installed In public
tor the current Eastern Star year. The large hall, which was crowded
with hundreds of prominent ladles and gentlemen, was decorated in the
east with heavy maroon draping;*, in the center of which hung the American
flag, and above that blazed In brilliant colors and electric effects the beautiful
flve-pninted star of the order. At the stations In the north, south and west
there were neat displays of flowers. A special feature was the placing at the
stations of the central star of a small table at the chair of each point. Each
chair was draped in the color of the point, and on each table was a fairy lamp
encased in fancy paper, also the color of the point. The small lights pro
duced a novel and pretty effect.
The installing officer was the retiring worthy matron. Mrs. Annl^ Marie
Johnson, who was assisted In the ceremonial by Mrs. Elizabeth Dorothea Wet
,len. past worthy matron, acting as marshal. The officers who, with the ex
ception of the conductress and chaplain, were inducted into office, were all
! anl, as they sat in the semi-circle to the west of the
iiltir. presented a very pretty picture. The officers elected for the current
term are: Emma Carter, worthy matron; John Carpenter Klmball, worthy
patron; Mrs. John Tonningsen. associate matron; Eva May Hare, secretary;
Isadora Horton, treasurer; Henrietta Albertlne McLagan. associate conduc-
Mfclten Loots*. Reid, Adah: Bertha Wagner Stack, Ruth; Llla May
Kimball, Esther; Cella Warren. Martha; Virginia Lee Lewis, electa; Annie
Johnson, marshal; Michael Joseph Savage, chaplain; Alice Severance,
organist; May Carter, warder; Walter Rawllns, sentinel.
The music for the ceremonies, solos and choruses was by the California
Commandery Quartetâ Messrs. Wendel, Smith, IfcÃain and Batkln. It was
excellent. The retiring matron won many words of praise for the faithful and
careful manner in which she delivered the charges to the new officers, and
Impressed them with the importance of the duties they were assuming. After
the ceremony Mrs. Alyce Gates rendered vocal selections. The retiring mat
ron, Mrs. Johnson, was, in an eloquent speech by the retiring patron, pre
sented with a diamond-set Jewel of her office on behalf of the chapter, and
then Dr. A. H. MUlberry. also on behalf of the chapter, presented a beautiful
jewel to Micheal J. Savage, the retiring patron. This wax followed by the pre
sentation of like Jewels to Past Patrons Dr. MUlberry and W. H. Wharff.
The congratulations, which followed, being at an end, all retired to the
dancing hall, where there was a programme of dances until midnight.

ASSESSOR DODGE
ON THE CARPET
OF GRAND JURY
Bitter Talk Over Clerk
Hire.
A MATTER OF SPITE WORK
â¢
THE DOCTOR WAS EXASPER
ATED BY QUESTIONS.
Inquisitors Think Salaries of Assist
ants Should Be Paid Out of
Per Cent Allowed on
Collections.
Assessor Dodge was a very angry ; man
when he came out of the Grand Jury
room last evening-, after having been ask
ed some pertinent questions regarding the
salaries paid to clerks employed In his
ofllco for the collection of poll taxes. He
was asked whether he did not think that
these salaries should be paid out of the
15 per cent anowed him on the collections
instead of imposing the liability upon th
city. While the statute does not exactly
provide that they should the Grand Jury
holds that It favors that construction of
the law. To all of the questions put to
him Dodge replied that he was following
the custom established in his office for
years past and that his course was cor
rect.
Dodge finally became exasperated at his
inquisition and accused the Grand Jury
of. having brought up the matter to annoy
him at the instance of an applicant for a
position whom he had turned down. The
jury disclaimed that it had acted at the
behest of any person and insisted that it
was simply pursuing its inquiries on the
matter in the line of Its duty. The In
quiry was postponed until next Tuesday
afternoon, when a special meeting will be
held.
Several reports of committees were
handed in, but as there are more to be
received the full report of the Grand Jury
will probably not be reaav until next
Thursday, when the last session will be
held and the report Issued for publica
tion.

ing. chairman; J. F. Wulsen and A. Ja
cobs, will visit the Sheriffs office this
morning at 10 o'clock to Investigate the
books of that office.
road to Hetch-Hetchy Valley and esti
mates that the road could be coimtnu-t.-d
between these point* for $52,200. The com
ml>->lon has suggested that a feasible
route exists from Hetch-HHehv Vallt y to
Carter, the i<rÂ« s.-nt terminus of the Sierra
Railway. Tno conunlMiOJl has not Invt-s
tigatrd this route, though required to do
ho by law.
The Tenaiya Canyon route, which Is a
shorter route from Lake Tenaiya to the
Y/oscmlte Valley, will cost $.v:.t<>4.
The only prnposnl new road upon which
the commission klvos accurate and defi
nite data is the Merced route. It Is main
tained that thtl road can be constructed
-.i ;ln to he easily accessible fr>>m Merced,
afarlposa and Tuolumne counties. Many
reaaona are given why this v a desirable
route. Among others It Is stated that it
would be an all-winter rond. and it is
evidently favored by the commission as
the most practicable for a free public
highway Into the valley.
The report is accompanied hy numerous
photographs and exhibits. Senator Per
kins and nt preaentatlve do Vrlet are now
preparing a resolution to be introduced
::i i "ingress asking that the report be
published and that the photographs ac
companying the same be lithographed.

CITY ATTORNEY
LANE'S GRAVE
RESPONSIBILITY
Telephone Reforms in
His Hands.
UGLY BOASTS OF PAID AGENTS
SUPERVISORS EAGER FOR AN
OPINION.
They Will Stop the Wrenched Service
of the Monopoly if Lane Assures
Them of Their
Power.
Interest In what If perhaps the most im
portant piece of proposed municipal legis
lation has center* d absolutely around City
Attorney Franklin K. 1-ine. Mr. Lane
lias now the opportunity of gratifying
what lie told thousands of people was
his deepest wish. As a pleader for votes
hÂ«- asked to be tested in any affair that
affected the well being of the city. Tht
tot has rorae. Responsibility for the suc
cess or failure of the proposed reforms in
the wretched telrphone service of this
city rests with htm and with him alone.
And It must t>e said In all fairness that
Mr. I-ane is not Inclined to accept the re
fepunsiblllty.
The authorized acents of the telephone
xr.onopoly are boasting that they will pre
vent thft proposed relorms, and by meth
ods peculiar to themselves delay action
until the present Board of Supervisors is
powerless to act- Th< se agents have suc
ceeded in placing the future course of the
contemplated legislation i" the hands of
City Attorney Lane. The Justice of the
proposed reforms Is universally conceded.
Even the paid representatives of the- mo
nopoly admit that the public has been
robbed.' It is conceded that fairness will
be insured by legislation to the multitude
of the telephone company's patrons, and
that a great and perfectly Just revenue
will accrue to the city.
The question of Supervisorial power to
make the reforms is the only one un
settled. The Supervisors declare thum-
MIVM ready to adopt the ordinances if
they are assured that they have that pow
er, and they ;Â».-k city Attorney Lane to
answer the question which It* of Mien
public moment and which means such
tnateVial public benefit.
The Supervisors want this answer In
time to act upon It a I their next meet-
Ing on Monday. They know that cor
rupt means are being used to defeat the
ordinances and they want no unneces
sary delay In their own action. But Mr.
Lane nayw he does not know that he can
(rive an opinion on or before Monday. He
Kays that the Supervt ors have not al
ways received his opinions with courtesy,
and carries with his assertion an Infer
ence that because of alleged discourtesy
he is Justified In trifling with matters that
deeply concern the public
His own words are best, and are as fol
lows:
"1 cannot Fay positively when I shall
hand in my opinion on the ordinance
which provides for the enforcement of a
collection of a Ucenw.- for the nlckel-in
the-slot telephones. 1 have been sick, and
as it Is a matter which will necessitate
much legal examination and study I do
not know whether or not 1 shall be ready
for the SujM^rviscrs when they meet on
Monday. They have not treated my
opinions with much courtesy In the past,
but 1 shall give this my fullest attention
and study Just the same."
If the apathy of the City Attorney is
not quickly dispelled the jwople of San
Francisco will lose a very material bene-
Jit. the paid agents of the telephone mon
opoly will have made pood their offensive
boast and Mr. Lane will have upon h!m-
Mtf the consequences of h!s unquestioned
responsibility.

Evenly Matched.
SAN JOSE. Dec. 14.â The football cham
pionship of Santa Clara Valley Is Still In
abeyance. The elevens representing the
State Normal School and Santa Clara
College played a tie game on Wednesday,
leaving the question of supremacy still in
doubt.
The hero of the hour Is Heston of the
State Normal School. With the score 6
to 0 In favor of Santa Clara College he
xnan:igod to pet a clear Held and with a
magnificent run of eighty yarns scored a
touchdown for his team, thus preventing
defeat. - ".'
A large crowd, composed principally of
students from both Institutions of learn
ing, was present and with college yells
and music urged on their favorites to
mighty deeds on the field. Sant.i Clara
worked the ball to the Normals" 10-yard
line and then on a fumble lost it. The
Normals forced the ball back to the cen
ter of the lleld, where they lost it. Then
Santa Clara by a succession of splendid
bucks carried the ball over the goal line
lor a touchdown. The goal m kicked
and the lii>t half ended.
The second half began with the ball In
possession of the Normals. Play had been
resumed but a few moments when Heston
made his great run. The score was tied
amid great excitement. Both sides played
their hardest, but wore unable to score
again. When the whistle blew for the
end of the game the ball was In posses
sion of Santa Clara on the Normals' 35
yard line. â¢ â

succeeded in drawing out some very spir

magnificent looking youngsters were led
into the ring.
It was the banner sale of the season in
one respectâ the high prices obtained,
Cambaceres brought $1200, the top price
of the sale. When the coal black son of

into the ring a murmur of admiration

Cavanaugh of Sacramento, after whom
the colt was named, wired that he would

these odd*. In the mutucls of the first 220 tickets written
â 116 called for Turner and 104 for Parker. Turner was in
greater, demand to v.in In from one to six or seven to
twelve round . while Parker's admirers were strongly
represented on the last line, eighteen rounds or over. On
form this shows peculiar reasoning on the part of the bet
tors. From what Is known of the men. Turner Is the more
finished boxer of the pair, while Parker Is credited with
the more aggressiveness. The preliminary bout is East
against West. Clarence Richie representing the former,
while Willie Cole is a product of the local ring. Richie
has the longer record, which Is offset In a degree by Cole's
victory over Jimmy Anthony. "Billy" Jordan will ref

GAVE AWAY
WEIGHT AND
WON EASILY
Zoroaster Appears Unbeat
able in His Class â Four
Winning Choices.
Conceding weight to all but Dunblane In
the mile handicap at Tanforan yesterday,
the stout-hearted little three-year-old
Zoroaster earned another easy victory.
Wyoming ruled e<|ual favorite In the bet
ting with the Shields entry and the handl
capper figured him to rock the thre.
old u> steep, Wyoming did <ut up capati
out in t>:.- lead f"i- nearly six furlongs.
but when Spencer called Ofl Zoroaster he
leisurely dethroned Galen Brown * aeefal
mudiarK, winning in a gallop. N;i|i;imax,
which was away badly, Bnlahed third. The
two-year-old Dunblane riMi out at tl â 
turn, practically rtilnins? his ch..rv
it was perfect weather for "mudders."
and the talent met with more than aver
age luck In picking the winners. Purees
were captured by four of the six favorites
In the betting.
The nine two-year-olds starting- In the
opening .-cnnniilc went to the post with
Burdock, the mount of Burns, ruling a
slight favorite over Norford, Slsquoc and
March Seven. Norford was apparently
the best, but was interfered with on the
bend for home, and in a drive was beaten
out a head by the first choice. Slsquoc ran
third.
A very close and exciting drive marked
the tlnish of the six-furlong run which
followed, Maud Ferguson, Grand Sachem
and Genoa striking the wire heads apart
in the order named. Genua and Amasu
made the running to the stretch, where
the latter gave It up. Genua looked to be
winning, but faltered as the wire was
neared and was beaten two heads. Thorpe
rode the winner, Maud Ferguson, which
was 7 to 1 in the ring.
Louis Baell'i mare Espionage closed a
lukewarm choice for the mile and a six
teenth run, with Jennie Reed next In de
mand. Neither finished inside the money.
After passing the stand Jones, on Im
perious, a i to 1 shot, took the lead and.
never hard pressed won handily. Driving
furiously, Ifeadowtborpe took the place
from Montanua by â  nose.
'. Such .a hot tip was prevalent on Hard
Knot to win the fourth event that the
price against Ventoro lengthened from 3
to 5 to even money. Hard Knot ran In
second place to the stretch, where he had
enough and the favorite won easing up
from . Ballsta.- Zurich and Blooming
Chance were outclassed.
\ Track Notoes.
Sixteen books cut in for the final three
days" at Tanforan. Most of them quit
loser on the days gambling operations.
Tim Murphy laid prices under name of
the Wheeler Club.
In another Jump or two (Jrand Sachem

It Is evident the Montana I. >rse is shaping

the door, but so dense a volume of steam

passage occupied 115 days, the longest on

There was absolutely no ground for all
the worry over the failure of the vessel
to make port, for she was merely delayed
by heavy weather. The fear that yellow
fever had carried off her crew was also
without foundation, for at no time was
there any sickness of an Infectious nature
aboard the ship. Ten per cent reinsurance
had been offered on her at San Francisco.

THE CITY ATTORNEY
REFUSES TO APPEAR
AI.AMKDA, Dec. 14.â City Attornt-y
Taylor hap noticed the City TTMUm that
ho will not act ax attorney for the defense
Jn the suit of A- V. Fisher against the city
of AlamÂ«Â«lit for $212 50 alleged to be due
htm a* collector of the electric light plant.
The City Attorney states an his reason
that he advised the City Trustees that the
claim of Fisher for salary. $75, as collector
was a legal claim. The resolution dis
missing him was not legal, because it only
declared the office vacant anil did not
name Fleher; further, a city employe
could not be removed after the beginning
of â¢ month except for cause, and no caute
was stated in the resolution passed July 3.
Trustee Hackle opposed allowing the
claim and stated that he contended that
the board had a right to remove an em
ploye when cause Justified It. He said
they had not stated the cause in the reso
lution to spare Fisher's feelings, but the
cause i listed He was in favor of testlmr
the mutter In the courts. Fisher replied
to Mr. Uaclcle's remarks and a squabble
was about to ensue, when Trustee Shulte
moved that the matter be laid over. The
motion prevailed and since that time the
board has taken no action other than to
(lie Fisher's claims, which he has pre
sented monthly. They have been waiting
for Fisher to bring suit to test the matter
in court.
The City Trustees have asked Mr. Tay
lor to meet with them to-morrow evening
to consider the matter.

Committee Makes Exhaustive Raport
on the Question and Gives Un
qualified Support to the
Plans.
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council held last night the following re
port was rendered:
To the Building Trades Councilâ Gentlemen:
Your committee to which was Intrusted the
furtherance of the Question of the Issuance of
bonds for municipal Improvements begs leave
to report ns follow*!
At its meeting two weeks since, the Building
Trade* Council unanimously Indorsed the pro
posed bond issues. '
During the Interim the following unions have
met and have unanimously expressed their ap
proval of the measures: Carpenters* Union No.
22; Carpenters' Unl(pn No. 95; Carpenters Lnton
No 4*3; Bricklayers" Association; Amalgamated
Woodworkers" No. 15; Varnishes' and Polish
ers" No. 1: Cement Worker*' Union; Painter?"
and Decorators' Union No. "3; Marble Finish
ers and Polishers' Union: Stalrbullders 1 Union;
Metal Roofers" Union: Tile and Mantel Setters"
Union; Cornice Workers' Union; Stonecutter*
Union, and Derrick Workers' Union.
Other unions will follow as their regular
meetings are held.
Organized labor as re-presented In the differ
ent unions Is doing Its utmost for the success
of the measure*, and It becomes the duty of
every affiliating member to constitute himself
a committee of one to assist In this movement.
Matters of such great -Importance should re
ceive the undivided attention of every laboring
man. as no Question which has ever been pre
sented to the people of San Francisco haÂ« car
ried such general and Infinite rood.
The Question <>l the extension of our park
system is one that'eoncerns every citizen, resi
dent and taxpayer In no small degree.
The construction and operation of railroads
anil other tramÂ«i>ortatlon facilities are the Im
portant factors In the increase of the population
of the city, and while It so Increases from year
to year and becomes the more congested, the
acquirement Of public space does not Increase
proportionately, and the time must come, If our
citizens are blind to the conditions, when the
absence of such pleasure grounds and places of
recreation will be of manifest necessity, which
necessity has not heretofore been keenly felt,
owing to the- ran Id growth of San Francisco and
the transformation of open and vacant lands
into residence and business centers.
These chungeÃ having occurred so gradually,
the people are hardly awake to the future re
sult, and If present advantages are not accept
ed. In future little can be done at what the
total will now cost. /
In ISSO San Francisco's population of 233,000
had one acre of park to every 216 persons; to
day, with a population of 350,000. she owns one
acr<Â» of park to every 214 personsâ a strong in
crease which forcibly foretells future necessi
ties.
Pan Francisco has before her the greatest fu
ture of any city In the United States. She Is the
' Intermediate point between our great Ka^tern
and Industrial centers and the Oriental mar
' kets. She In row and ever must be the open
door of the great traniÂ»-Paclrlc trade, and muÂ»t
necessarily attract Dion attention and be the
objective point of more travelers than any city
In our Union.
It Is for this reason that the spirit of pro-
Kr"-.slveneÂ»e should be rampant. Our citizens
should stop at no reasonable outlay to Increase
her attractiveness, as the results which natur
ally follow Improvement must Increase her land
values In a marked degree.
These are Home of the reasons why the labor
i ing people of San Francisco favor Improve
ment* which affect the welfare of every resi
dent; and organized labor, feeling that It Is
largely responsible for the new city government
and the new organic law which controls that
government. Joins with all other citizens in a
sincere and earnest desire that these proposed
Improvements be successfully accomplished.

The public life of John Jay brings into
review the epoch of American btetoty
from tii.- opt nJng of th.- Revolution to the
beginning ol Jefferson's â dsatniaUmtloa,
from 1774 to I*>l. I period of a little BMN

maker of the noted "Jay treaty" of iT'.tl.
and as Governor of M< w York fr>Â«m i"'>Â»
U> OK Throughout this great career,
whether be be NSjarded as a man, a.s a
diplomatist, as a jurist, as a statesman,
or as a publicist. Jay may confidently tie
pronounced one of the noblest and ablest
public men In the annals of America.
John Jay was of Dutch and French
Huguenot descent. He was born in New
Tort City m December 12. IM B* grad
' fnai King's College, now Colum
bia. In 1764. and four years later, after
hard study in law. he way admitted to thÂ»Â»
bar. Already the controversy r
whi< h led to the American Revolution.
Jay was of a whig family. Ills tMttUTt
had fieri from France and Holland In pro
test againbt acts of royal prerogative
and tyranny. In 1774 Jay married a Liv
ingston, a representative of another whig
family of prominence In America, and
thus we jce that Jay's antecedents, asso
ciations and Inclinations all combined to
lead him io throw himself Into the came
of American independence. Jay's con-

Mission to Spain.
By a secret article annexed to the
famous treaty of alliance between France
and the United States of 177*Â» a right Sjras*
reserved to Spain of acceding to this
treaty whenever she might think proper.
Congress was anxious to strengthen our
foreign alliances. Accordingly, on Sep
tember 17, 1773, Jay was appointed as Min
ister to Spain to negotiate a treaty of al
liance, amity and commerceâ that is, to
induce Spain to come into the same rela
tion with us as France had come.
If his Catholic Majesty (the Kins of Spain)
shall accede to the treaties and In concurrence
with France anil the United States continue
the present war with < treat Britain. If he -..hall
obtain the Florldas from Great Britain, these
United States will guarantee the same to his
Catholic Majesty; provided always that UN
United States shall enjoy the free navigation
of the Hlver Mississippi into and from the
sea. You are particularly to endeavor to ob
tain some convenient port, or ports, below
the 31st degree of north latitude on the river
Mississippi, free for all merchant . vessels,
roods, wares and merchandise belonging to
the Inhabitants of these States.
These words from the instructions of
Congress to Jay indicate particularly,
though only partially, the purpose of Con
gress in this Spanish mission. A port on
the Mississippi, or the navigation of that
river to the sea, was the subject of diplo
matic contention between us and Spiln
for more than twenty years during and
following our revolution. To the Western
settlers there was no other subject of
equal importance. But to the people down
East the great interior seemed Â»o Viist
and far away that they supposed it must
be settled only very slowly and that gen-
rations must pass before Its con.:,
would be worth considering.
Negotiations for Independence, 1782.
In the face of Spanish delays and eva
sions. Jay's mission dragged Its weary
and fruitless way along until. In 1782. ne
was transferred to Paris to aid Franklin
and Adams In negotiations for our inde
pendence. In these negotiations we find
Jay's most brilliant and diplomatic tri
umphâa triumph most worthy of himself
and his country. With Adams and Frank
lin he won the Ohio Valley and our
boundary on the Mississippi and tne
lakes. The full story of this really bril
liant diplomacy Is too long for th. â¢-â¢ col
umns, and we can but indicate the ad
verse scheme which he circumvented, and
the results which, with his colleagues, he
did so much to achieve.
Jay's experience at Madrid had revealed
to him the animus of the Spanish and
French court*. He suspected Vergennes,
the French Minister of Foreign Affairs,
of a willingness, If not of a design, M
making a treaty detrimental to the inter
ests of America. During the early nego
tiations at Paris Franklin was sick with
the gout and Adams had not yet arrived
from Holland; so Jay was alone with the
responsibility.
â When Jay learned that Vergennes had
sent Raynevalâ trusted agent of Ver
gennesâto England on a secret mission
to urge a policy against pur claims to the
fisheries and to- the valleys of the Ohio
and the Mississippi, he secretly sent
Vaughan to counteract this mission and
to urge upon Shelburne the policy .of
treating Independently with the United
States, without the knowledge and con
currence of France, and especially to re
sist a settlement which would deprive us
of the Mississippi, would strengthen
France In America, and would sow only
seeds of Irritation between us and Great
Britain for the future. Jay found Shel
burne ready to adopt a policy designed to
encourage and widen the breach between
France and her ally.. Oswald, the Brit
ish negotiator, received Instructions to
consent to the treaty which Jay desired.
France was subsequently astounded at
the liberality of the terms that we had
secured, and Franklin, who stood In bet
ter favor at the French court than Jay,
had the delicate task of making apologies
to Vergeones. The astuteness with which.

"I apprehend." said Jay. "that Conrresa
marked out that line of conduct for their own
sake and not for the sake of France. The ob-
Ject of th.lt Instruction was the supposed Inter
est of America, and not of France; and wÂ«
were directed to ask the advice at the FrÂ«n<-h
Minister because It wan thmiirht advantageous
to our country that we should receive and tvÂ»
Roverned by It. Congress only, therefore, has a
right to complain of our departure from that
Instruction."
As with all croat statesmen and diplo
matists, bo It was with Jayâ the Interests
or his country and the circumstances un
der which he found himself determined
the course which he pursued.
Secretary of Congress for Foreign
Affairs.
On May 7. 17*4. Jay was elected by Con*
Kress Secretary for Foreign Affairs, a po
sition which he held until the Inaugura
tion of the new government under thÂ«
constitution. In 17*9. In these year* ho
continued th. negotiations with Spain
touching the Mississippi and following a
temporary disposition of Congress, he re
linquished, by an agreement of 1781. cer
tain rights on that river for a period of
years. During these yearn also ho did
much to promote the adoption of the new
constitution.
Chief Justice Jay.
When Washington came to the Presi
dency he offered to Jay his choice of tho
Fedora! offices - a
mark of the highest
honor and distinc
tion. Under tho new
administration Jay
wan naturally a
Federalist, as he es
pecially wished to
TnÂ»e â thr â establish
ment of a Btronjf
and durable Nation
al Government. JIo
believed that a
strong and highly
respected Judiciary,
as Interpreter of the
constitution. could
do much toward this
end. Th- first Judi
ciary act providing
for the appointment
of a Chief Justice
und five associate
Justices win ap
proved on Septem
ber 24. 178 D, and two
days later Jay was
appointed and con
firmed as tho first
Chief .1 us 1 I cc.
"When the spotless
ermine of the Judl
clul robe," says
Daniel Wtbat er,
"fell upon John Jay,
It touched nothing
touched nothing
less spotless than It
self." He was an
upright Judge. Dur
ing his short ser
vice In this office ho
did much to estab
lish the dignity of
the court, to pre
serve Its Independ
ence from legislative
and executive en-
enmrhment, and to
pro Mote lrÂ»Â» Jurisdic
tion. If not to Â«e< ure

Jay's Treaty.
i T*?* .Peace treaty with Great Britain
in 1781 had never been executed. We com
plained that Great Britain still held our
\\ estern posts and refused compen.ia.tion
for negroes can away. Great Britain
complained that we had refused to reim
burse the loyalists, and that we had put
ImpcdlmentM In the way of the collection
of British debts In America.
After the outbreak of war between
France and England In 17*3. with our peo
pie divided as hot partisans on the Issue*
of that war. with the republican or
the I-rench party urging our Government
actively to support our former ally, thero
was Imminent danger of war with Eng
land. Washington .â ru Jay as special en
voy to negotiate for the settlement of dif
ferences. ii.- -â¢...â ...:.,! In preserving
peace with honor. }!â¢ brought home a
treaty which for a while was the most
unpopular in the history of American
diplomacy. It caused Jay to be hanged
In effigy, Hamilton to be stoned In thÂ«
streets and Washington to be called "the
stepfather of his country," and the dlgnl
tled Rutledge was guilty of the Indlscru
tlon of calling Jay a "fool and a knave,"
an utterance which cost Rutledge'n con
firmation as Chief Justice to succeed Jay.
Jay's treaty did not, Indeed, secure .ill
that a stronger nation might have se
cured, and it left our country exposed to
national and commercial wrongs which,
would be Intolerable where there was
strength to resist. Hut It Is the unmis
takable verdict of history that at the time
the treaty was better than war. that It
was probably the best that could he ob
tained, and that It postponed our second
struggle with Great Britain until we were
more able to endure It.
Jay Becomes Governor of New York.
It would cause great political surpriso
to-day if the Chief Justice of the United
States should resign his high office to be
come the candidate of his party for the
Governorship of Illinois. No State Is so
Imperial to-day as to command such def
erence, and the nation Is so much greater
In the public eye. One hundred years ago
it was not so. The States were then rela
lively higher In the affection and esteem
of the people and of public men. The of
fice of Chief Justice was then not so well
established nor so highly appreciated. Be
fore lii* return from England Jay was
nominated by the Federalists for Gover
nor of New York He accepted the nom
ination, was elected, resigning from the
bench to accept thÂ» post. During his six
years of service as an executive, from 1733
to 1801. he manifested the same high senÂ»Â«
of personal integrity and public duty.
With the Incoming of Jefferson Jay re
tired from public life. He passed thÂ« re
mainder of his days on his estate In West
chester County, New York, where he died
on May 7. 1829. In the eighty-fourth year
of his age.
The story of Jay* life as here related
reveals the character of the man. In a
country destined to republicanism. whll<Â»
he was a thorough republican he was not
a democrat. He believed that Intelligence
and property should govern. "Those who
own the country should rule it." was his
raying. But In this respect he was but In
harmony with the great majority of the
leaders and statesmen of that aristocratic
age. He was a friend to the people and
to gocd government. As a statesman he
was of strict integrity, fearless and Inde
pendent In his utterances on public hum
lions; and no situation In politics or di
plomacy was ever permitted to vitiate his
character as an honorable man. "A little
good-natured wisdom." he one* said,
"often does more in politics than much
slippery craft." He met craft and deceit
with the character and straightforward
conduct of a high-minded and honest man.
For such a man was Jay, "without fear
and without reproach."

London Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 14.â The Commercial Ad-
TertlÂ»er's London financial cablegram says:
ThU w *Â« aa emotional day on the Btock Ex
change. It began flat, on the news of the looses
sustained by Genera] Methuen and dear money,
Liquidation was stopped at noon by the rumor
that Ladysmlth had been relieved and the mar
ket hardened sll*htly. Near 4 p. m. it was
stated on the board that the War Office con
firmed the news and this created buoyancy and
a great hubbub, during which little could he
bought. The sensation continued In the. street,
but profit-taking sale* caused a relapse. In
j creased by the announcement that the War
Office had not confirmed the Ladysmlth rumor
: or th* sensational stories of heavy Boer losses.
Consols were 101Hfrl02\%.
American* opened weak, being sold for the
quarter of an hour. There was free buying of
them In the afternoon on the expectation that
New York would buy on the war rumor. New
. York, however, sold, causing a setback. Near
! the close again the market boomed, finally
easing off on the street.
Spanish 4's were 66'Â»; Tintos, 4J*Â»'j?4s; Ana
] condas. TS: Utah?. 64.
The bank bought' Â£15.000 gold In French coin
and Â£5000 in liars, the first bars taken for a
long time. Thin was regarded as a hopeful
symptom, the market price having fallen to
76a Â»4d. It Is understood that Berlin will send
here to-morrow Â£150.000 pold. A Vienna broker
received a dihpatch to the effect that the Hank
of Austria will arrnnpre to supply the Dank of
England up to Â£2.500.000 of gold, but leading
bankers discredit this. Money was In strong
demand early for exchange operations. The
bank did a Igr,od business In loans. Discount
houses raised deposit rate* 4.
Three small exchance failures were caused
by the fall In WestraUans.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Dec. 14 âWheat opened a shade
down for May at 694 c. It was believed that
j the Government report to-morrow would be
i bearish and there was come selling on this, ;
the market early turning dull and heavy with
the price under puts. Buying against privileges
I held the market steady for some time, when
I further support was received from the strength
of corn and the reduction In the Manitoba yield
| given In the official report of the province.
The Improvement In the financial condition of
Wall street was also an Influence In the
strength near the clew. May eloped 'iif '*c over
yesterday at CS^ic.
Corn was exceptionally strong, due chiefly to
I the sudden spurt In the all-rail demand which
: appears yesterday. May closed at the 'top, Vie
over yesterday.
Oats were very dull, but advanced a bit with
corn. May closed 'isj'.;c over yesterday at "'4 ! ,

cently occupied. May pork closed 7VsÂ©loc lower.

SCORED A SUCCESS
SACRIFICES HAVE BEEN MADE. |
Â£1 X adding to th. fund for the site many have sacrificed. Contributors
have Riven gladly to th<Â» cnu.Â«Â»Â« who mado real denials In doing so.
*" This has come to the knowledge of Ebell and makes each and every
member frol pratt-ful. The memlwrs thempelvcs have worked hard and
faithfully. Where they could not pledpe as much m they wished, they have
Clven thÂ«Jr time; come of them for th* entire month.
The task of securing the money, however, has been a pleasant one. The
Central Interest *hown has been exceedingly gratifying. ThoFe who could
111 afford to pive have added their contribution to those who could' give eas
ily. The library site has Indeed been a public movement.
MRS. R. P. GLEASON.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
MB Broadway. Dec. 14.
THE Society's library fund has
been completed.
After thirty days of hard work
the efforts of the ladles have l>een
crowned with success, and r.ot only
has the f:.\V* Vl necessary for the site been
raided, but there Is a decided surplus that
will go toward the building and furnishing
Of a children's room In the library.
To the ladles of the Ebcll Society the
people of Oakland owe the Jlnal securing
of a library site, when contentions, geo
graphical, political Â»nÂ«l commercial,
threatened to divert from Oakland the
gift of KO.AM) tnade by Andrew Carnegie
for an Oakland free library. To Henry A.
Chittenden. A newspaper man with a de
fire to do hlÂ» home city a service, do they
owe the donation received from Mr. Car
uegle. To-night sees the ftnafconsumma
tion of the oft -expressed wishes and hopes
< f the people of Oakland.
The site fund was completed to-night,
when Mrs. K. p. Gleason. the president of
the Kbell Society, announced at the "11
brary nlghf at the First Presbyterian
Church that she had received the final do
nation that mado the purchase of the site
l>o*.sibleâ a telegraphic donation of $3000
from C P. Huntlngton. the president of
the Southern Pacltle Company. Yesterday
the fund lacked nearly $3iXK) on Its face,
with about J14.1>00 In cash, and the possi
bility of fome of the pledges not being
fully collected. To-day many of the
tuedges wen* paid In. but even to-night,
counting cash, pledges and all assets, the
fund Jacked over 11250 of completion. The
ncact total of the fund to-night was $IS.
703 RL Then came the donation of C. P.
Hirntlngton Of $3010. which relieved the
society pf further anxiety. at)d made the
library site an absolute certainty
,, Two , lar S<* funis were paid in to-day. E.
a: Lukens paid his pledge of $MOO and Dr.
gforg* C. Pardee r , u ld his pledge of $501.
These did not add to the total of the fund,
for they were only the original list se
cured by the gentlemen when they under
took this work and failed, but the checks
were sent to-day.
It was with light heart* that the ladies
brgan their preparations for the general
meeting nt the First Presbyterian Â»'hureh
this ev-nlng. They knew that thÂ» lr fund
was completed and the fact that the
Â»<ath<r was stormy and would affect the
crowds that were Â»xi>ected did not bear
so heavily upon them as it might have
done had they depended upon the meeting
to complete thdr fund.
Mrs. It. P. cileason. the president of the
Ltxll Soviet v. opened the meeting with
:*'w wyds. She merely announced an im
jmmpru for tho piano and violin, by John
jv. Met calf and Alex T. Stewart. Then
harles S. Greene, the librarian of th
r< o Library, gave an Illustrated addres*
ipaa the libraries of the country. The
I nlver*lty of California Glee Club sang
â¢nd Miss Hope Cheney gave a piano solo,
fhen Mrs. Gk-asc.n. through whose Instru
mentality the original library donation
lad boon secured, paid a few words.
Mr. Chittenden paid the ladles of the
Shell a compliment for Vhaving tak*Â»n the
!brary site question out of the realms of
xtmrnvert-y" and spoke of the hard and
â arnest work of the ladles !n this public
matter. "And the Ebell." said he. "are
mbllc spirited, for by their fruits shall
;e know th^m. nnd those are thÂ«Â« fruits."
Mayor Snow was detained at the league
if Municipalities and Dr. George C. Par-
JeÂ«Â» was confined to his hom<* with a cold,
md then John P. Irl<h spoke upon be
half of the citizens. He said In part:
"Two things have l>eÂ«Â»n settled hero to
nlcht. and the lesser of these is the site
NO PARK TO BE SPOILED.
fk AM .r,i3 to know that the library Is not to be placed In a public park.
*M We have too few park* now and those we have were Riven with the
W idea that they were to remain parks." and not be covered with build-
In**. Already Oakland has used three of her squares up. The County
all 1s on one-, the Hall of Records on another and the Chabot Observatory
n a third. The city ha* been spared the using of a fourth.

hayÂ«Â« the library property located and
secured for the city Is. of course, a great
feat, but it is not the greater. The
greater Is the exhibition to the people of
Oakland of what can be accomplished by
unity of purpose and harmony of effort.
There have been many propositions ad
vanced in Oakland, but they have failed
because of n lack of unity. The gentle
man have tried time and again to ac
complish something, but they have never
been able to agree. Hereafter I shall
advocate putting everything in the hands
of trie laales. It is well and lining that
this should hare been accomplished by
the women of Oakland. it 1- well that
(-â¢â  me of the donations should have been
small and 1 me from the workingman
and the mechanic. Particularly .is this
latter a .good indication, for li means that
â¢ very donation given from this class rep
resents a desire on the. part of some
father to give his child better advantages
than he had himself. And nil that has
been given to this fund, from the small
est, even to the greatest, of which you
will hear later, has been given to make
the future generation better than the one
to which we inf."
Mrs. Gleason reaa the telegram from C.
P. Huntington mak a JtttVM donation.
which was received with applause. "We
are particularly grateful to the centle
man. who has lifted all anxiety from our
shoulders, and who despite the many
calls that are made upon him every day.
has found It in his heart to make SO lib
eral and generous a donation at the mo
ment when It was needed. For the Bbell
Society 1 can hardly express how grateful
we are. This donation has made It pos
sible for us to do something that we very
much wanted to do. It will give us a sur
plus over and above the amount needed
for the site, and Mr. Huntington's gen
erosity will enable us to carry out our
Idea for a children's room In the library.
We have always wanted to build a room
for the little ones. whÂ»Â»re they can have
little chairs and tables and pleasant sur
roundings. We have .1 fund of $127 41
raised by the children In dimes and <]i;ar
ters. and even In one case a penny. It rep
resents a great many little gifts. This
fund the ladle* of the Ebell will duplicate,
making it I2T>4 *2 for this room. The pro
ceeds of the baseball came on Saturday
will also go to that room, and all the sur
plus that is created by this last generous
donation will go to swell the children's
fund. And I would only like to say
for the members of the Kbell Society that
they have donated about $I*Â»' without
considering the work of the ladles them

EBELL SOCIETY MOVEMENT
WAS BGRN IN A WHISPER
Â»HE monument by the BtMsfl Society
for the library site ha.l Its birth In a
whisper. That whisper grew to a
suggestion, then to â  vigorous protest.
And the retail Is such a successful Â«fee
out of the weak beginning that it will go
down In municipal annals to future Ren
erations of troubled, citizens with Rood
fortune but little faith.
At the Ebell Club one afternoon. whÂ»n
"Fad*" was the topic under discussion,
and an expected speaker, the Rev.
Charles R. Drown' of the First Congre
gational Church, had not arrived, there
was a cap in the programme that had to
be filled for the waiting audience. Dr.
C. Annette B'.ickel. who was present,

THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, FHIDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1890-
quene# *poke to the ladles for a few
minutes. Dr. Knox having called for
opinions.
Dr. Buckel protested against the use of
a city park for the site. The parks were
too few already, she declared. When she
sat down the chairman called for a vote
that would express park or nntl-p.'irk.
Th< vote eras unanimous against the use
Of a <-tty square.
A; nii'f. with such a spontaneous dem
onstration, action of Borne sort was de
cided upon, and before Dr. Brown ap
peared to discuss "Fads," Chairman Dr.
Myra Knox had appointed a coraml'tte
to "look into the library site matter."
That committee had Mrs. Frederick B.
Ginn as its chairman. And It "looked. 1 "

That afternoon late the committee came
together, only for a few- moments, how
ever, and named an early hour next day
for a meeting and the unfolding of plans.
The following morning. November 10, the
committee met again, each having al
ready inquired as to site*, prices and the
like, and lid out mentally, Napoleon like,
the campaign."
The Aral thing to decide upon seemed
very properly the site. With none In view
the beat work could not be done. The
ladles saw this and secured an option on
the lot at Fourteenth and Grove streets
at onceâ an agreeing proposition If not In
every respect and to every one an agree
able one. By the following Monday night
the Bbell Society knew what Us commit
tee deemed best, concurred, and the fight
began. With this sketch of the beginning
must be considered the shortness of time,
to realize with what perfectness and dis
patch the matter was handled.
Then the little committee resolved itself
into a committee that included the board
and later a committee of one hundred.
This was done Monday and hastily in or
der that a request to the Council asking
that body to defer a decision as to parks
might have as much weight as need be.
Then the committee embraced the ' Knell's
four hundred members, and with a. gen
eral feeling in their favor against the
using of a park for a site the ladies ret
to work.
The option, definitely settled upon Tues
day, November 12, seemed satisfactory
and the work went on with no noticeable
or noteworthy dissension. Indeed, with
no dissension whatever within the society.
The proposition as put forward by the
committee of gentlemen who had some
time fore made a move In the direction
of a site had been of this character: The
money was to be subscribed toward a
$30,000 site (unselected). no one to make a
payment until all of the $30,000 had been
subscribed. This had not met with pop
ular favor.
The advantage of organization must
first be considered In reviewing the
Ebell's success. Then came the freedom
from political jealousies and ambitions.
Not a part of the constituency, the ladies
were able to solicit voluntary subscrip
tions where the men could not. And with
a named, located, definite lot In view do
nations began to come In steadily and en*
couragingly.
Of the original list of subscribers as se

MEN WHO SHOT
VINCENT STILL
ARE AT LARGE
Police Investigation Is
Unavailing.
Oakland Office San Pranol<Â«crÂ» Call.
90S Broadway. Dec 14.
The Bhootlnjf of Robert Vincent on Sat
urday night by footpads has caused the
upual crop of wild Ktorles about robberies,
.-ittemptod robbet lei. hold-ups, burglars
and thÂ»- llkÂ»*. Kxclt^d people imaÃine that
bohind ewry tree is a hlÃhwayman. and
the slamming of a door at night Is trans
f'>rmÂ«-<l Into a burglary.
AnWe from the nhoottng of Vincent on
Saturday night Oakland has been free
from even the average burglary for at
least thirty day*. This leads to the be
lief that either the Vincent shooting *as
the work of a local gang or It was the
work of the name gang that klllrd
Thomas, the West Oakland saloon k
and which had left Oakland until the <x
< Itement of the killing of Thomas should
Mow OVÂ«r. If it is a local gang they ar.'
very Inexperienced men, unn if it if a mr
|an| t hut is working Oakland they
;irÂ«- rH9 desperate men, who shoot upon
the leant provocation. They certainly are
not men, who go about robbing rooms in
lodging houses and burglarizing houses.
The utory of the attempted nold-up of
Manuel Courant. the employe of the Oak
land Parcel Delivery stables. Is not cred
ited by the police, and Is believed to have
been the result of an overwrought Im
agination. The reported robbery' <>f Frank
Courant 's saloon was not a robbery' a(
all, for Courant told the police himself
that it wan an "inside Job." and he
thought that he knew who took the
money and he would not prosecute.
But while these minor cases are of not
the slightest Importance, the shooting of
Vincent was a particularly dangerous af
fair, and the Police Department Is not a
little exercised over It. Nothing has been
found since the first two days of the
search. The two hats afford no trace of
the men. for there is nothing about ihe
hats to give any clew aa to the pur
chasers. There are thousands of hats of
pledge. This was the signal for many
other payments and new pledges and
gifts from 1 Id and young, until, it will be

FTE pnprrs deserve generous praise. They have irlven spar* unstlnt-
M J Ingly during this month of hard work and uncertainty. Every day th*
â¢^ financial situation has been presented with Ita brightest side out. En
couragement and glowing accounts have helped the ladles to work and
helped the public to give. The end shows what co-operation and
Ized effort can do. And Just as much gratitude Is due the men of Oak
land as the women. For what could the ladles have accomplished without
the aid of the men? DR. MTRA KNOX.

GREATER FREEDOM IN
UNIVERSITY STUDIES
Students Given an Option for Less
Mathematics and Fewer Hours of
Prescribed Work.
BERKELEY. Dec. 14.â An Important
change In the courses of study at the Uni
versity of California is being made by the
faculty at the close of the present tÂ«rm.
The change goeÂ« into effect after August
1, 1900. and its general tendency is to
lighten the academic work by doing away
with a great deal of prescribed study,
which for a long time has been the bane
of students.
The first alteration comes In the old bug
bear of mathematics. According to pres
ent regulations the academic courses
given In the colleges of letters, social
sciences and natural sciences require ten
hours of mathematics before the aca
demic degrees an be conferred. This re
quirement the faculty has slashed almost
by one-half, cutting the number of hours
down to a minimum of six. The reason
for this Is given that the standard of
mathematics In preparatory schools has
ho far improved as to warrant the deduc
tion.
A second slash has been made. In the
number of units for work' in the group
elective. Th* present requirements of
thirty hours have been cut to twenty-four
for the three colleges mentioned above.
The last change lessens the amount of
pedagogy required for State high school
teachers' certificates by four hours. Up
to this time twelve units of work have
been necessary- Now but eight will be
needed.
In adopting this new method the Uni
versity, of â¢California follows the lead of
Harvard University, which has been the
pioneer In the matter of freedom of choice
to its students. It Is thought that the In
fluence of President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler has been largely Instrumental In
inducing the faculty to take this forward
step. â¢ V" â !

i 1t , B a E ' Vo'quarlsen told a pitiful story
In Judge Ellsworth's court to-day of a
brother extreme cruelty. It was at th"
trial of th* Mult of the Stewart Collection
Agency against J. H. Rempe for the re
covery of WO on an assigned claim of
Mrs \ olquarlaen for services rendered
her brother as housekeeper at wages Â«.f
tlo per month. .
In his answer Rempe net up a counter
claim for boarding and lodging his sistera
three children, who have been stopping at
his home on Twenty-fourth street for
seven years. The testimony went tn show
that during- Â»h* first four years JtosÃM
had paid his sister 115 monthly for actlntr
as his housekeeper. Then. too. her chil
dren found employment part of the tlnvÂ»
and out of their earnings Rempo paid
himself for their board and lodging. .
Mrs. Volquarlsen went on the stand thin
afternoon and testified that three years
ago she sustain*-.! a broken leg In an ac
cident and had been unable to work for
about eleven months, but during the la.it
two years Â»he had been doing the hni,, .'
work as before, yet her brother ha* re
fused to pay her as before.
In answer to a Question . she repltn]*
"When I asked him for my wages ha
said he would yet pay me with a bullet
and then he usually beat me besides. Ifo
used to abuse me and during the last few
years has not treated me at all as i
brother should treat his sister. My chil
dren worked and they paid him for their
board and lodging and I had to work very
hard." ...
â  The entire afternoon was occupied in
taking testimony and at adjournment of
court the trial was continued.
Hemp*, the defendant. Is a painter by
occupation and Is said to be quite well-to

TIIE RAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1899.
WOULD EXTEND
CIVIL SERVICE
League Sends Letter to
the President.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS. Dec. 14.â At the spe
cial meeting of the executive committee
of the National Civil Service Reform
League to-day a communication which
was sent to President McKlnley Novem
ber 16. and not heretofore published, was
submitted. It Is in part as follows:
Sir: The undersigned member* of the execu- ,
tive committee c{ the National Civil Service
Reform League hereby respectfully Invite your
attention to the following facts:
In January. lfci 1 ?. a special committee ap
pointed by the league called upon you for the
purpose of remonstrating against your contem- ,
plated executive order for excluding certain :
places from the classified service, and to this
committee you expressed your intention of add
ing other places to the service, greater In num
ber than those excluded. After the promul
gation of your order of May 29. under date of j
September 8, this special committee, consisting â¢
of Messrs. William Dudley Foulke, Richard \
Henry Dana an.l Herbert Webb, addressed to '
you the following letter:
"To the Presidentâ Sir: The undersigned, as
members of a committee of the National Civil
Service League, which waited upon you In Jan
uary. IW9. In regard to your proposed order for '
excluding certain places from the classified ser- '
vice, teg to remind you of the fact that In our i
conversation we expressed the hope that If you
found It necessary to make those exclusions
you would at the same time Include within the ;
classified list, subject to competitive examina
tion, at least as large a number of places as
those omitted, so that It might appear that no â 
backward step had been taken. To this you
replied that It was your Intention to Include a i
great many more places than those excluded, â 
and that you hoped to make the order so com- !
prehensive that the reform of the civil service '
would then be to complete that nothing further
would need to be done In regard to It.
"Our disappointment was, therefore, great
when, upon the appearance of your order, we
found not only that the number of exclusions
was far greater than had been previously sup- ,
posed, bat that there waa none of the inclusions !
which you had* assured us It was your Intention '
to make.
"May we not hope that It Is still your purpose
to make some substantial and Important ex
tensions of the present classified system t
"We believe that the large number of exclu
sions made by your order of May 29 from the
requirement of competitive examination has
been Injurious, not to the civil service of the ,
Government only but to th* country at lance,
and we hore to satisfy you of this by the re
sults of certain Investigations which we Intend
to lay before you at an early date and ask you
for a revocation of that order.
"We beg leave to Inquire whether we may not
now look for the additions to the classified ser
vice promised In the Republican platform of ]
1F96. and which we were then assured It was
your Intention to make, and If so, whether It
will be ajrreeaUe to you to state at what time
such additions may be expected."
Thin was signed by Georce McAneny
(secretary). Carl Schurr. Richard Henry
Dana and eighteen others.
Along with the communication to the
President was submitted the following:

STREET IMPROVEMENT
and
CITY WATER WORKS
(Continued From Third Page.)
cities have not provided for street improve
ments In their charters the Legislature may
d" so. It becomes Important, then, to all
charter cltleti, a* well as other municipali
ties of this State, provided they have no
system of street improvement laws In the
charters themselves, to either amend their
charters before the meeting of the next
Legislature, so as to adopt some system
of street Improvement, or to extend all
their Influence to have fair statutes pasted
by. the Legislature upon this subject.
It Is conceded, 1 think, that no one sys
tem of apportionment Is entirely satisfac
tory in every locality, and It Is only rea
sonable to say that even In the same city
no one system Is found entirely satisfactory
for ever}' piece of street work that may be
necessary.
It seems to me that a system of street
improvements should be adopted by the
Legislature by which the governing body
of a city may adopt any one of the plans
which have been In vogue In California In
the past In street Improvement or other
plans which may be suggested by which
street Improvement may be done. The
widest liberty should be given to the cities
themselves In the matter of street Improve
ment. Giving the matter Into the hands of
the cities themselves and permitting them
to have a wide choice of methods will in
time Justify the statement that the city
can take care of Its own affairs.
The remainder of the morning session
was devoted to a discussion of this
paper. City Attorney Guy R. Kennedy
of Chlco added his testimony against the
Vrooman act, which, had proved a failure
In his town. He favored a plan that
would allow the Board of Trustees to
carry on street improvements, even
against the wishes of. property-owners.
He suggested the appointment by the
convention of a committee to draft a law
to that effect to take the place of the
Vrooman act. City Attorney Yorko of
Napa took the same general view. Street
Superintendent C. W. Finch of Riverside
hau no kind words for the Vrooman act,
which he had found to be ineffectual.
He favored the right of the property
owners to protest up to a certain limit
and a district assessment system as
means to the end of street improvement.
Mayor Eaten of I/os Angeles was not
flattering in his comments on the work
ings of the present street law In Los An
geles. One trouble he had found with It
was that it allowed men with political
pulls to take charge of work of which
they were entirely ignorant. On the right
of protest he said: "1 think property
owners ought to have the right to pro
test, because very often contractors for
their own benefit got up lobs, and If there
was no right of protest they would work
many Jobs through city councils."
In answer to a question of Joseph
Hutchlnson of Palo Alto, Mayor Eaton
said that the Vrooman act amended along
the lines of the old Los Angeles charter
should work well.
Joseph Spinney of the Fresno Board of
Trustees proposed a plan of street assess
ment which seemed to meet with ap
proval. He advised that each city should
ascertain at the beginning of each fiscal
year how much street work was contem
plated for that year, and raise the money
for It in the tax levy and create a special
fund.
Joseph Hutchlnson said that a plan
similar to that advocated by Mr. Hpinuey
had been tried successfully In battling
with the B-Â»wer problem at Palo Alto. He
said the objection to the Vronman act
lay In the fact that It appeared as If
money was being taken from their
pockets to pay for public improvements
W. A. Hale of Martinez, Bernard Bi*>n
cnfleld''of this city. W. H. Turner of Mer
ced and Trustee Sweet of Santa Rosa all
made suggestions on the general linen of
discussion. On motion of Mr. Hutchinsm
th" chair was directed to appoint a com
mittee to draft a new bill for street work
which, after ratification by the conven
tion, should be presented to the Legis
lature.
W. A. Hale Introduced the following
resolution, which was referred to the ex
ecutive committee: '
Resolved. That the legislative commit
tee be directed to prepare a Mil, the pur
pose of which will be to exempt the gen
eral business enterprises within Incorporated
cities from the payment of licenses to the
counties. . .
At the afternoon session the convention
listened to many Interesting discourses on
the experiences of cities that owned and
operated their own water works. Each
speaker was an advocate of municipal
ownership and based his approval of the
proposition on his knowledge of the bene
fits he claimed it has been to the com
munities that have adopted the pollcv
President Sweet of the Santa Rosa Trus
tees. President Druffel of the Santa Clara
Trustees. Professor Marx of . Palo Alto
and City Trustee Sore.nson of Modesto
talked on the subject. The remarks of
Mr. Sorenson were emphasized with a
natural' wit that took the wrinkles out
of the faces of the sedate gentlemen who
preside ovÂ«r the destinies of the cities of
the State.
Trustee < Sweet described in detail the
difficulties his city had gone through in
..establishing Its water plant and the clr
cumstances and conditions that led up !
to the adoption of the policy of municipal
ownership.
( "Seven or eight years ago." he said,
"our people became annoyed at .the quan
tity and quality of the water that was
being furnished by the water corporation ;
and there were rumblings that It was ,
time for the city to acquire Its own plant.
It was soon found that there waa an over
whelming Pentlment in favor of munlci
pal ownership. A bond election followed ;
and tho people voted In favor of the prop- ;
osltlon by a great majority.
"At the start we made many mistakes, \
principally for the reason that few of our ]
officials knew anything about the man- i
agement or ooeratlon of water work.Â«. !
Threatened litigation prevented us from j
floating our bonds, but we finally made a '
deal with a contractor to put in the plant 1
and take his pay In bonds. Under the J
corporation system there was a scarcity i
of water, the quality was poor and for a j
time the Irrigation of the gardens, which
are Santa Rosa's pride, was stopped.
"Wo at first sunk wells, but they were
failures. Then we sunk a shaft 45 feet !
Into the ground and from that we ran .
tunnels north and south and struck a fair
i supply of water. The present city admin
istration extended tbe tunnels and we
now have a steady flow both winter and '
summer of more than 1.000,000 gallons a I
The original cost of our plant was j
JlfiO.ooo. but the people would not sell it
now for twice that amount, and I doubt
i If an offer of $500,000 would tempt them to
part with It. We do not charge the peo-
I pie a cent for water and have not done
so for five years. The piant Is operated
by direct taxation. There Is an annual
levy of about 264 cents on the Jl<v> valua
i tlon for the purpose. Of this amount 25
i cents goes to the bond Interest and re
j demption fund and the balance Is for the
â¢ operating expenses of the works.
"It 1b my opinion that every young city
should strive for free water, and lots
of It."
An equally rosy hue was found in the
, municipal ownership system by Trustee
; Druffel of Santa Clara. His city wa-s
I bonded for 16000 for a water plant after
the service furnished b; a corporation
i proved unsatisfactory- The plant cost
$5300 and the running expenses amount to
; $300 a month. The Income Is In the neigh
; borhood of $600, leaving a surplus annual
,ly of *400 d. This pays the interest and one
! of the bonds every year and leaves a bal- i
: an< c for possible contingencies. Santa
Clara now gets all of Its water for mu
\ nlcipal purposes free, where formerly it
I paid the corporation about $2000 a year.
So i;reat has been the success with the
! water plant that the people are under
taking the issuance of $30,000 bonds for
i the erection of a municipal gas plant to
j supply private consumers.
Professor C. I. Miirx of Palo AJto said
I that Santa Uoea made Its most serious
error when It started to establish Its own
water plant without having any definite
plans for the future. He contended that
the free water plan was not a reasonable
ono, claiming that the only business
' method by which a city should handle Its
own water works was by supplying the
commodity at cost.
Mayor Sweet replied to this by saying
that one of the matters that was under
consideration by the present City Council
of Santa Rosa was the devising of a plan
to prevent the waste of water and thÂ«
â  alms* of the free privilege. The plan
apr.-.l upon was to supply all consumers
I through meter*, allowing a reasonable
' ami 'mi i of water fret; all In excess was to
be charged for.
"Why, up in my town." said Mr. Sweet.
"It would be P' lltical suicide for an offi
cial to suggest such a thing as the people
paying foi wal
A widow hud stood between Trustee
Sorenson of Modesto and municipal own
| ershlp. He admitted that he had finally
been won over, but neglected to Â»ay whet
became of tbe widow.
"In vious to lv'V he said, "a private
corporation owned Modesto'a water sup
ply. The corporation wad a widowâ a
modest girl, whom we all loved and re
spected. Our pr- utest danger was that in
the- event <>f .i big cuiflacratlon the water
works would bt turned up first. We were
without a â  ''-m. and the existing
water supply was not of sufficient capa
city to flush one I will admit thut at the
Start I was among those who did not fa
vor municipal ownership, because I could
not help standing In with the widow. I
was between two tiresâ lf I voted for mu
nicipal ownership I would make a finan
cial ruin of th.- widow, and If I did not. I
felt that I would w.tke up some mornlns;
and find that 1 had died during the night
fr.'tn malaria be< â¢â¢ Modesto had no
FyMem. Now we have everything
and the city owns the whole business and
runs the plant at a profit."
The problem was also discussed by D.
F. Hunt of Banta Hnrharn. Professor
Randall of Berkeley and Trustee Winter
of Redwood City, letters approving the
â¢. of munelpal ownership were read
From Mayor I^nrnh of Santa Cruz and
from the City Clerk of Monrovia. \
Before the afternoon session adjourned
the chairman appointed the following
committee to draft new street laws to be
Bubmltted to the next Legislature: Joseph
Hutchinson. Palo Alto; W. A. Reasley.
San Jose; E. K. Taylor. Alameda; Mayor
Fred Eaton, T>os Anerel.-*; < '. W. Finch,
Riverside; Joseph Spinney, Fresno; May
or J. S. Sweet. Santa Rosa; City Attorney
J. T. Yorke. Napa; O. R. Kennedy, Chlco.
Mayor Qwest of Santa Rosa presided
over the evening session. In hln Introduc
tory remarks he Invited the league to hold
Its next convention In the city of which
he Is mayor. Hearty applause greeted
his Invitation.
"Santa Rosa Is not*rt for Its hospital
ity." said Mayor Swrvt, "and always glad
ly welcomes anything that will Improve
it Nothing will do us m.>re e.>..d than a
convention of this organization. If you
p.. to Santa ROM next year our peopl* will

POULTRY SHOW WAS A
SUCCESS FINANCIALLY
OAKLAND, Dec 14.â President F. B.
Mason -of the Oakland Poultry Associa
tion, under whose auspices the exhibition
was given last week, Bays that the af
fair proved a great success financially.
â¢We cleared between $400 and $500." he
said to-day. "The Pacifies gave about the
same kind of an exhibition and went be
hind over $1000. The^Supervisors gave us
an appropriation of $300 to help us out on
our last undertaking, and I understand
there la a move on foot now to consoli
date the Los Angeles and other organi
zations into one and get an appropria
tion from the Legislature to help defray
the expenses of a show on a large scale.
I don't know whether the idea is a good
one or not. A large concern does not
always pay better than when the same
proposition la conducted on a smaller
scale."

TRIO OF BRUTAL
WIFE-BEATERS IN
POLICE COURTS
Pitiful Tale of Annie
Harkins.
THE WORST ON RECORD
rOKCED TO SUPPORT HER HUS-
BAND SINCE MARRIED.
John Francis Healey Nearly Killed
:e and Milo C. Damon
Made Three Unsuccessful
Attempts.
A pitiful taJe ws* related by Mrs. Annie
Ilarkins In Judge TTÂ»-adwe!]'s court yes
trrday of her treatment at the hands of
torr huÂ»t>and. Thoma* Harkins. and it
caused the Judge to remark that It was
the most atrocious rase that had comÂ©
under nls observation. Harkins was
charged vlth threatening to kill her.
She '.<â  a qulet-looklng little woman,
l>*rely rut of her teens, although she has
b<Â»en married five years. She testified
that the day after her marriage her hus
band compelled her to go to work In a
box factory, and she had been working
there ever since supporting him and her
â elf. AU the money she had go: from
h!m during these years was about S3. He
began to &biike her and she had him or
;â  -:.*j, but he was co i>enitent that he
Â»n* not punished, Then he began to
:r- ..-â¢â  her atain, and kuma months aÂ£o
h â¢â  left htm and went to !lve at 207 doo
â¢â¢. : street. She eaxne<l from 35 cents to
SI 10 per day. and out that che had kept
:.â¢ :*'.:'. ar.d t*aved money to buy a silk
Or- -h. a ;.h K. ; and othrr articles. It took
her four months to save enough to buy
thÂ«* Jacket.
I*at>t Friday Harkins went to her room
and demanded money from her. She .e
1 .-â â¢'.. and he cut Into pieces her silk
<lrÂ«i.ii. her Jacket, three capes and every
thing he could get hold of that belonged
to her and finished up by cutting the tÂ»-a
clothe* that belonged to the landlaoy.
Then he threatened to cut her heart out.
Harklns was put on the stand and de
rled his wlfe'B charge*. He tried to
b'.arkrn her character, but was promptly
stopped by the Judjze. uho said that the
young wife's appearance was sufficient to
refute Â«uch a charge. He admitted that
during the past three months phe had
given him "dough to buy cigarettes."
The Judge did not mince ni.< words in
denouncing Hnrklr.s and urdeml him tit'Â«
custody on $50*Â» bonds. The cntÂ»e was
fontlnued until to-day, and meantime thÂ«
testimony will W written up and the wit
roses were a>krtl to iitiiMi iv cuurt 10
sin it.
John Francis Healey, 141 Fourth ttrett.
was yesterday hÂ«-ld to answer before the
Superior court by Judge Graham on a
Â« barge of assault with a deadly weapon
In CJOO bonds. November TS he went
liome under the Influence of liquor and
tried to breaJc all the crockery In the
kitchen on hi* wife's head. She was
taken to the City and County Hospital,
and for a f<-w days her life was despaired
of.

IT WAS SUICIDE.
The Man Found Drowned Tied the
â¢-t to His Body and
Jumped Into the Water.
Th* piece of iron casting found tied
around the body of the unknown man
found drowned near the Folsom-strcet
flip last Wednesday morning wat identi
fied yesterday a.Â« belonging to the plle
driving outfit of the State Harbor Com
missioners, which had been in use near
the Blip at about the supposed time that
the man Jumped overboard with the
â¢weight. The fnct that the man's right
arm was free and had not been tied
points to th<Â« theory of suicide, for It was
Â«tn easy matter for the deceased to have
fastened the weight to hlmstlf In the way
It was when thÂ« body was found. The
clothing worn by the deceased consisted
of :t Ma' k diagonal sack coat, vest and
pants, black cotton shirt with white
stripe, tan lace shoes, white Canton flan
jiel drawers and whit* merino undershirt.
Deputy Coroner Gately. a water-front
man himself, gave his opinion yesterdny
that the weight must have been fastened
by the deceased. The ropÂ« used was an
ordinary clothes line.

STANDING ROOM ONLY AT THE PLAYERS' BENEFIT
IT Isn't every day that a playerâ
not oven as eminent a tragedian as
Frederick Warde. or ae> sweet a
singer as Cainllle d'Arvilleâ has the
opportunity of facing a $2500 audience.
It Is a supreme theatrical experience
to be met with only In the rosiest <^f
box-office dreams. Such a dream
came true yesterday afternoon at the
Orphcum. and actors by the ' dozen,
as they strutted to the plaudits of the
multitude, could not have been
Mat had they pinched themselves
to make sure they were not walking
in their slerp.
San Francisco was showing Itself In
response to the appeal of the Asso
ciated Theatrical Managers for help
In raising a fund to be used tn tiding
over to better times such player folk
as may be overtaken by sickness or
adverse circumstances. Outside the
steady rain of the morning had be
come a torrential downpour. It was
weather to make a manager thinK un
utterable woe. The best that any
single theater In the city could have
offered would not have drawn a cor
poral's guard under such a cloudburst.

MAN WITH THE HOE AT
THE LOAN EXHIBITION
MILLET'S FAMOUS PICTUBE
SHOWN AT INSTITUTE.
Many Celebrated and Costly Paint
ings in a Wonderful Collection
All Owned by Local Art
Lovers.
The rain helped keep many a'.vay from
the opening of the Loan Exhibition at the
Art Institute last evening. Those who
failed to attend have much cause for re
gret, for the paintings on exhibition rep
resent some of the. world's masterpieces
and many specimens from the brushes of
i famous artists.
In this wonderful collection, all the prop
erty of local art connoisseurs and art
lovers, are paintings from such celebrated
artists as Millet. Sir John Mlllais. Meyer
yon Bremen. Bouguereau. David Col,
Roybet. Vedder. Beaugnlet. Grosjean.
Jacques and Kowalsky.
The most admlrea and probably the
most famous of all the paintings on ex
hibition is Millet's "Man With the Hoe."
the property of Mrs. William Crocker. An
idea of how much the owner values the
painting may be Rained by the fact that
, an insurance of Jlitf/*") is placed upon it.
The Institute has taken especial pains to
present the picture in the best light. It
has been placed against a deep crimÃOn
background, and altogether the lights
have been co managed a? to bring out the
best points In the famous drawing. The
picture has been ing so that It will
show with equal advantage both at day
and night.
Mr*. Emille Donohoe shows two splen
did paintings that attracted marked at
tention. Yon Bremen's "Peasant Girl
Heading*" and Bouguereau's "Peasant
Child With Porringer." The Bouguereau
"Peasant Child" and Mlllais' "Duck
lings." owned by Irving Scott, are two
magnificent studies of child life from two
very different standpoints.
A dainty landscape that was the obicet
of much praise and critical observation
was Grosjean's "Bagatelle Pond." the
property of Dr. Louis Bazet. This deli
cate bit of coloring shows famous sport
In the Bolt de Boulogne, close to tin Bag
ate: Castle of Comte d'Artols.
The exhibition will continue throughout
the month.

ENDED HER LIFE
BY HER OWN ACT
Ollie Williar Turned
On the Gas.
BROKE HER WORD TO HARRY
SHE HAD PROMISED HER YOUNG
SON NOT TO DO IT.
Mrs. Ollle B. Wltllar three years ago
left her husband, and her sad story was
ended yesterday when her dead body was
laid on a slab in the Morgue.
SlrkneÂ«s and poverty had fallen to her
Jot and weary of her struggle she chose
j the fate of the suicide. She was found
yesterday morning unconscious in her
room in the Ashworth House at 320 Mason
street. Employes of the place noticed the
strung odor of Illuminating gas Issuing
from her room. They broke the transom
and passed the bellboy through, so that
he could unlock the door, the key being
on the Inside. The gas turned off and an
entrance having been effected, the unfor
tunate woman was found just as she had
retired on the preceding evening. It was
thought at first that she was dead, but a
faint fluttering at the heart and a barely
perceptible heaving of her bosom were
evidences that she wu still living and
lice wen notified by telephone. The
unconscious woman was hurried In an
ambulance to the City Receiving Hos
pital and was placed upon the operating
table for the purpose of administration of
restoratives, but before the surgeons had
time to roll up their sleeves she expired.
Shr left a note jn pencil on her table,
-ed to her ll'-year-old son Harry.
rnsdlnj as follows:
Harry. <Var love, forgive me for breaking
my word. Your MAMMA.
Uor son has boen attending school at
Hoitt's Academy In San M;ttfo <"ounty.
Last Monday she told him that she was
tired of living and intended to kill herself.
H. begged and pleaded with her not to do
ho, and the reu-ntÂ»-,i and promised that
she would not commit suicide.
Thnt is the explanation of the note,
made yesterday by the boy's father. H. R.

from "Chimes of Normandy" by the
company from the Grand Opera-house,
were beautiful features of a long aft
ernoon's entertainment that scintil

Camille d'Arville of the Orpheum
company, and with the witticisms of
Ferris Hartman of the Tlvoll, the
whirlings of the Mohring brothers of
the Olympia, the cyclonic revolutions
of Bonomour^'s Arabs. The Eccentric

down to explain the uses of the bene

The tragedian spoke feelingly of the
erduousness of the players' life and of
the hardness of the lines he some
times fell upon, good as he might be,
through the inconstancy of a public.
"Tne idol of to-day." he saiU, "may
be shattered to-morrow."
The fund, he continued, was to be
used for the benefit of such luckless
players as might through sickness or
other misfortune find themselves in
need. For that reason, he went on, he
waa glad to see such a generous re
sponse, although he had expected
nothing less.
"I say to you." he proceeded, "that
I speak sincerely when I say that in
no city of the civilized world are
actors received with more cordiality,
and. if they merit it. with more en
couragement and reward than In this
city of San Francisco. And you must
he glad to think that the laughter and
applause you have given this afternoon

some poor actor benefited by your

FISTS FLY OUT
IN A SUITER
STREET CAR
C. Walter Would Not
Be Jolted.
SAYS HIS PATIENCE "WENT"
ELBOW JABS IN THE BACK NOT
TO HIS LIKING.
Early Morning Episode Which Pro
voked the Extreme Wrath of the
Well-Known Carpet
Man.
Clarence R. "Walter of the carpet firm
of D. N. & E. Walter has for many years
been an ardent follower ct the flstle
sport, as far as a religious attendance at
prize-flghts Is concerned. Peering from
the boxes around the ring he lmblbe<] a
pugilistic wisdom that was theoretically
startling. Yesterday morning he worked
off some of this theory In a practical *ray.
and now Mr. Walter has the proud diÂ«-
Unction of bearing a title that rovers tha
territory confined to a Sutter-strcet car.
It was 8 o'clock in the morning when
Mr. Walter boarded a Butter-street car
moving eastward. Owing to the rain a
crowd of passengers packed platform and
aisles, but Mr. Walter finally secured
breathing and standing room along with
a strap supporter.. Every stop brought a
Jar, and every Jar brought the elbow of
another pastenger full in the small of Mr.
Walter's Lack. After several blocks had
been traveled Walter came to the con
clusion that this persistent Jabbing had
become a habit and should for this reason
be overlooked. While in this frame of
mind there came another elbow Jab. more
acute and forcible than its predecessors,
and Mr. Walter's patience was lost.
Slowly and surely he felt his stock of
temper vanishing. Something was said
and the stranger replied with a retort
that unloosened the fists of Mr. Walter
from the strap and they founu lodgment
on the stranger's person. By this time the
passengers began to take a hand In the
hostilities. The contestants were sep
arated and moved to opposite ends of the
aisle to protect the safety of riders and
keep the peace.
Mr. Waiter wan most anxious to ex
change cards with the stranger, but his
friends interceded. His version of the
story Is as follows:
"This man kept poking me In the back
until my patience was exhausted. I was
about to expostulate with him when he
turned around with a La Blanche swing
that Jarred. There was nothing left for
me to do but retaliate, and this I did. If
this man is looking for satisfaction let
him show himself. I tried to avoid all
unnecessary trouble, but this man de
liberately went out of his way to pro
voke a blow."
On account of the time neces
sary in the p" eparation of the
Christmas edition of THE
CALL, to be issued Sunday,
December 17, NO ADVERTISE
MENTS for that issue will be
received AFTER 9:30 P. M.
SATURDAY.
LOCAL COMPOSERS.
Gold Medal Awarded to A. F. Lejeal
of ThiÂ« City.
The Musicians' Club gave a con<--
Sherman A Clay Hal: last evening which
was of great Importance to the musical
cult of San Francisco. Inasmuch as Its
programme consisted, with the exception
of one number, of local compositions.
The purpose of the concert was to brlnu
out two string quartets which were writ
ten for a competition inaugurated by the
Musicians' Club something over a year
ago. They were sent for examination to
Arthur Foote of Boston, the eminent com
potter, who awarded the first prizeâ a gold
medalâ to Alois F. Lejeal of this cit> and
the second prixeâ a silver medalâ to
Charles E. Pemherton of Los Angeles.
The quartets were played In a maste-ly
manner by the Minettl Quartet. Mr. Le-
Jeal's composition created somewhat of a
sensation among the musicians present
and must be r f an.
Its character is of the buoyant class and
Its rhythmic quality gives it quite a cheer
ful tone. It consists of four movements,
each of which Is wor'hy of praise.
Another very Able composition was a
romanza for piano and violin by Otullo
Mlnettl. executed by Mother Wlamer an. l
Fred ItaUTCT Jr. It Is an emotlona.
and quite apropos to Its title. The criti
cal audience present was so well pleased
with this work that an encore was de
manded. Among the songs were three lit
tle gems by \V. A. Snbln \V. J. V
and Oscar WetL Th^e three com
could rot have chosen a better Interpretsr
for their works than Mrs. C. O. Richards,
whose refinement of taste enables her to
grasp brilliant Idea* quickly. Homer Hen
i ng a solo by Tl xl entitled
"Allah la I.lKht In
also a composition of much merit. It
embodies the oriental character of music
and Is made very unique by a wall, which
is characteristic of the Arabian chant.
There were two songs by Ad Loeher.
