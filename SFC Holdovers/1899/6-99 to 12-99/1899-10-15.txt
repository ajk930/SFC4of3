GREAT BRITAIN'S PLANS TO CRUSH
THE WARLIKE BOERS.
General Sir Redvers Buller Secures
Supreme Control of the English
Forces in . South Africa, and
Will Give No Quarter to the
Enemy.
LONDON, Oct. Xâ War, so often
predicted in these dispatches as be
ing the inevitable climax to hope
less things, has come at last and is
now in full swing for the subjection
of the little republic whose whole mili
tary sun rises and sots at Majuba Hill.
Great Britain has set going machinery
more powerful than that which crushed
Napoleon and twice as strong as that
â which gave her Egypt and the Soudan.
General Sir Redvers Buller has gone and
already the Boer bullets have sung a song
of desperate defiance.
That the next few weeks will be marked
by sharp fighting can almost be taken
for granted. That the result will prob
ably be for a time not too favorable to
the British is also to be admitted. The
main question Is how long are hostilities
to last. The ultimate English victory is
almost assured by virtue of overwhelm
ing strength.
A forecast of the length and nature of
the campaign should not be ventured
without knowledge of an extraordinary
circumstance communicated to the Asso
ciated Press on most reliable authority,
though hitherto not printed in England,
namely, that General Buller has gone
to take entire control of the South Afri
can situation. He will be as absolute
as was Wellington and less hampered
than was Kitchener. Therefore, not only
the conduct of the war lies in his discre
tion, but also virtually the future of, all
South Africa, and no prognostications are
of value without first taking Into con
sideration his personal character for ob-
Btinancy and frankness, traits responsible
for the supremacy he has attained.
Two months ago the Secretary of State
for War, the Marquis of Lansdowno, of
fered Buller command of the projected
army corps. Sir Reavers gave a point
blank refusal unless the War Office would
guarantee him between sixty and seventy
thousand men. He is quoted as having
said on that occasion: "I shall not be
handed down in history as another Sir
George Colley."
The reference was of course to the de
feat at Majuba Hill. He also said that if
he were to go it must be on the distinct
understanding that he could select his
mvn tta.fr and would be entirely uninter
fered with by the War Office,
His request regarding the staff. It Is
Baid, was prompted by his suspicion that
Lord Wolseiey would attempt to pay off
old scores by foisting upon him staff offi
cers antagonistic to him. Lord Lans
downe demurred, but the stronger man
prevailed, and Buller, having gained all
the points he coveted, accepted the su
preme command. Prior to Lord Lans
down-'s assent General Buller freely ex
pressed the opinion that when he had
driven the Boers into a corner his hand
mlgc: be stayed by a peace-loving public
or a well intentloned War Office â a condi
tion of things he could not tolerate, for,
as he expressed it, hie hand was "not one
of those that once put to the plow re
leases its grip."
It appears that both the Queen and the
Cabinet practically acquiesced in his de
mand, although of course retaining a
nominal control scarcely worth the name.
Buller is pretty certain to cut the wires
behind him and to be out of touch with
London at critical moments for fear the
Cabinet might change its mind.
It is this man, the: whom some of his
own officers do not hesitate to call a
brute, however much they admire his de
terminatljn, who holds the destiny of the
Transvaal and the Orange l-'ree State In
his hand. He knows the Boers and he
hates them. He has campaigned over the
whole present battle ground, a:, Is,' above
all, a soldier from head to foot. As soon
as he reaches South Africa he will inaug
urate a campaign of aggressiveness such
es the world has seldom seen, but which
he believes justifiable by virtue of his own
superior force. The sternest measures
will not be too stern for him, and until
the last vestige of Dutch power, whether
In the Transvaal, the Orange Free State
or Cape Colony, is swept out he will not
etay his hand. The idea is well Illus
trated by Sir John Tenniel's cartoon In
this week's Punch, representing John Bull
Baying: "As you will fight, you shall have
it this time. It is a lght to the finish."
General Buller's mission is nearly In
keeping with the spirit of the Colonial
Office. Rightly or wroi gly, bel.eving wat
to be the only possible method cf solv
lng the Transvaal trouble, those officials
have made no attempt to conceal their
satisfaction at receiving an ultimatum
Residence of President Kruger at Pretoria.
The San Francisco Call
from President Kruger, thus enabling
them to place the onus of the war on thÂ«
Boers. England may or may not have
nation for her contention, but the
Government organs, which must know by
personal knowledge the real feelings of
the anti-Boer party In England, have
made pitiful hypocrites of themselves In
printing Jeremiads upon Mr. Kruger's
perseverance In sending an ultimatum.
The only thing that surprises an impar
tial observer is that the Transvaal Presi
dent did not adopt this course before Eng
land's reinforcements arrived. The only
explanation of his failure to do so lies in
the report that he overestimates the
strength of the British peace party.
Once General Euller gets to work, it Is
believed here, the Boers will offer .tie
organized resistance. Something depends,
of course, upon the success they may
achieve In the interim, but the life In
surance companies are only asking an ex
tra premium of 6 pence as a war risk;
in other words placing the odds at 20 to L
This does not apply to South African Ir
regulars, fighting side by side with the
regulars, but it is said the Boers will
show them no quarter. This Is hard to
believe when It Is recalled with what un
usual humanity the Boers treated the
English prisoners during the previous
war.
Speaking of the -war of ISSI it should be
remembered that General Colley's entire
force amounted to less than 2000 men,
while the Boers had nearly 12,000. Gen
eral Sir George Stewart White, the Brit
ish commander In Natal, Is not likely to
fall Into General Colley's mistake of a
premature advance. In fact it Is rather
presumed that General White, knowing
the tremendous extent of the reinforce
ments on the way, will remain on the de
fensive, rather than risk a doubtful en
gagement.
All sorts of surmises are current re
garding the detailed strategy likely to be
employed. One authority says the hostil
ity of the Orange Free State confers an
immense advantage upon the British
forces, as it will enable Sir Redvers Dul
ler to go direct through that country
into the Transvaal.
The Naval and Military Record, in the
course of a most interesting article
written by an army officer who compares
the forces, says: "There is little doubt
that the losses on our side will be
heavy. Our troops will be compelled to
accept the role of attack upon prepared
positions, while the. Boers, at the very
outset, by means of their mobility, may
be able to make a dash into Natal, re
tiring with comparative ease if pressed.
But it is hard to believe that they have
staying power sufficient to prolong op
erations for any length of time. General
Buller will eventually be strong enough
to invest any fortified towns or positions
taken by the Boers and to sit down and
wait until exhaustion sets in among
them. Sparsely populated as is the veldt,
with a total area scarcely equal' to
France, it is questionable if 10,000 typical
yeomen, trained in the use of arms, can
be raised throughout the whole Trans
vaal. The rest are city men, with the
vices of greed and the love of ease en
gendered In centers of urban life.
"It is far from true that the Boers are
a godly, clean-living and generous race.
They have openly given out that the
British are to be uprooted, stock and
branch, and the oft-heard phrase, 'To
every man, a damsel or two,' throws a
lurid light on Mr. Kruger's pious front.
"We enjoy the sublime advantage of
eventually posing as the attacking party,
and it remains to be seen how far the
Boers are fitted for the wearisome role of
passive defense which sooner or later will
be Imposed upon them. The service re
volver they have In many cases discarded
for one of ten chambers, but I do not be
lieve there will be much hand to hand
fighting, for Sir Redvers Buller is well
aware that In a melee the advantages of
Iron discipline are to a great- extent lost.
We do not intend to allow the Boers to
close with our Infantry, although cavalry
patrol skirmishes will be unavoidable.
The- Transvaal forces prefer ambuscades,
and our difficulty will be to get Into con
tact with them. It is to be hoped that
the British-Indian troops will be de
tailed as an advance guard, for they are
well trained In ambush work."
Although Buller has gone, most of the
corps are still here. The Associated
Press learns that the Admiralty has final
ly fixed upon October 20 as the firm day
of regular embarkation, this continuing

each day thereafter from Southampton.
On October 23 and 25 there will be em
barkations of a large contingent of men
and equipment at Tilbury. These two
ports will be the only outlets of any Im
portance.
The Outlook quotes a member of the
Cabinet, whose name Is not given, but
who Is evidently Mr. Chamberlain, as
saying in private conversation: "Abso
lute equality, nothing more and nothing
less, is what we Intend to secure in South
Africa. There can be but one fate for
the Boer oligarchy and there can be left
no doubt regarding our sovereignty over
all South Africa. When these ends have
beep attained a policy of magnanimity
and consideration, such as has made the
French Canadians loyal British subjects,
will, I have no doubt, be applied with
equal success in South Africa. To de
stroy ruthlessly the best traditions and
amour propre of the Boers would be an
act of the supremest folly."
The Shippers' Gazette says that the
calling out of the reserves Is seriously
affecting the ship yards and engineering
works, especially the latter, resulting in
a slackening of the rate of ship products.
The plethora of money in England Is
evidenced by the fact that the Mansion
House fund for the Cape Town refugees
already reaches more than Â£<t),000, while
Â£3000 has Just been paid for a private

PLAN OF THE BOER
CAMPAIGN UNFOLDED
LONDON, Oct. 14.â capture of the
train on the western border of the Trans
vaal is the beginning of a few anticipated
reverses at the outset [of the campaign.
The Boer plan Is now unfolding itself. It
seems to be to* strike simultaneously at
different points, with a view of obtain
ing a strong strategic position In Natal
before the arrival of the British army
corps. At all points the British are faced
by Boer forces superior at least In num
ber.
The most dangerous positions, especially
since the loss of the armored, train, are
between Mafeklng and Vryburg. Colonel
Baden-Powell, who Is In command at Ma
feking, Is a man of the greatest courage
and energy, but he has only 2000 men,
many of them Irregulars, whose fighting
capacity is not known, although It is be
lieved to be good. The fact that he has
moved out of Mafeking Indicates some ap
prehension and In all likelihood he will
have to stand a fierce assault or a pro
longed siege. â¢}\'.ii iP^'j
General Sir George Stewart White, com
manding In Natal, Is estimated to have
about 15.000 men stretched In strongly in
trenched positions from Ladysmith to
Dundee. He is a man of great resources
and has the valuable assistance of Gen
eral Sir William Perm Symons, experi
enced in India, and of General Sir Archi
bald Hunter, experienced In- Soudan cam
paigns. -/'f?-
It Is now expected that the session of
Parliament will not exceed two weeks.
The opposition will devote Its energies to
an endeavor to extract from the Govern
ment some Information on what condi
tions peace will be concluded and as to
the future position of the Transvaal.

TO OBSERVE
THE STRICTEST
NEUTRALITY
But Germany Would Like to
Aid the Boers in the
Struggle.
Cop-frighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Oct. 14.â A high German offi
cial whose utterances may be taken as
absolutely conclusive said to-day:
"We shall observe the strictest neutral
ity, no matter what may develop In the
war between the Boer republic and Great
Britain. That is the only course left open
as conditions in South Africa are so com
plicated and our relations with both sides
are so delicate that to abandon neutrality
by bo much as a hair's breadth necessar
ily would lead to new and unforeseen
complications.
"We mean to adhere to neutrality
toward both parties. What else can we
do? Other powers spoken of as likely to
Interfere have also concluded .to keep
quiet. Such rumors as now and again
reach the pressâ Instance, the report
about the alleged attempts on the part
of the Russian Minister, Count Muravieff,
to bring about concerted intervention
are unfortunately only rumors. I say un
fortunately, the word showing how our
sympathies lie, but politics In these days
must be strictly separated from Interests
on one side and sympathies on the other.
It Is true our entire press calls upon, the
Government to interpose between the
brave little republics and big, powerful
England and again a crusade against
England is being preached to the nations
of the continent. But we would be fools
to listen to this siren song. On that oc
casion when we blew the alarm hornâ
refer to Emperor William's telegram to
President Kruger in 1896â and tried to as
semble the powers with a view of op
posing Great Britain In her selfish and
rude aggressiveness, we had a bad ex
perience. The lesson was not lost upon
us. Of course all the other powers would
like It only too well if Germany would
oppose England seriously In this matter,
but we doubtless would again be left to
our unaided selves. Therefore we are go
ing to avoid Intervention and to remain
strictly neutral in the coming struggle.
Our Intention has been communicated
fully" to the : Transvaal and to England.
England would not have gone on as she
has If she had not thoroughly understood
this. Do not understand me to mean that
Germany would not participate In some
concerted action looking toward Inter
vention, but she has no idea of again
taking the Initiative." _ .; /â __;.â ;; _
This authoritative declaration tallies
with one made by the Inspired Berliner
Post, in which the policy of neutrality is
likewise advanced. However, aside from,
the Government press every paper and
every person, high or low, condemns Eng
land. Many also seriously blame the
Government for its inactivity. The
Deutsche Tages Zeitung says: ..',.
"It Is unnecessary to say that our best
wishes accompany the Boers, for they will
fight not only In behalf of their own exist
ence but In behalf of Germany's position
in South Africa, which will be lost If the
British win. If, on the other hand, the
Boers win Great Britain will not only lose
South 'â  Africa â¢ but perhaps the whole of
her powerful position In the world."
The Kreuse Zeitung and the Hamburger,
. Nachrichten use similar ' arguments. The.
Deutsche Zeitung, referring to the ulti
matum, says; "The wrongs inflicted, by
Great Britain on the Transvaal are moun
tain high, and the impression made by the
ultimatum upon every impartial - person
is irresistible." ;; ;"- : -"-v _:'.":
The Lokal Anzelger calls England's pro
cedure "colossally brutal," and charges
Mr. Chamberlain and the war, party in
England with "dishonest financial opera
tions that render war necessary." . -.
The Frankfurter Zeitung says: "The
fact that Great Britain will not be hin
dered by other powers Is due to Ger
many's friendly neutrality, but England
will hardly be grateful for this after the
war is over." V, ~2
The Cologne Gazette says: "We hope
the Boers will not meet with the fate of
Spain and lose their own."
The Hamburger correspondent says:
"The other powers must wish to see Eng
land engaged as long as possible In a fight
with the Boers, as that will leave the way
free elsewhere for them."
The fact that President Kruger did not
receive birthday congratulations this year
from Emperor William is commented
upon regretfully by a number of papers.
There are, moreover, other evidences of
sympathy with the Boers. Subscription
lists are. being circulated on the Bourse
to raise money for the equipment of am
bulance wagons, and a Transvaal central
committee is forming to collect funds for
the same purpose.'-.!.-.*'''
GENERAL JOUBERT'S
CHARACTERISTIC LETTER
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â General P. J.
Joubert, the commander of the Boer
forces, has sent \ the following letter to
George Van Slclen under date of Septem
ber 11, ISD3:'
"Tour letter of August 6, 1599, came to
hand. I thank you for it and "for the op
portunity given me to remove and contra
dict a great misunderstanding or wrong
Impression that I am in favor In England

dent Kruger and I differ then It may be
in some of our opinions, but the mainte
nance of our self-government and the de
fense of our Independence are equally
close to the heart of each of us.
"Probably this letter will not reach you
before England has begun to fire her
cannon upon us. and then we shall have
the commencement of the fight, but our
God In heaven only knows what the end
will be.

tion, be no longer heard of." 'â¢,-;..-â ;.'
SHARP ENGAGEMENT AND
HEAVY LOSSES REPORTED
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â A World special from Cape Town says: A
sharp engagement between the Boers and the British forces
under Colonel Baden-Powell took place this morning near
Mafeking, in Bechuanaland. The losses are reported to be heavy
on both sides.
Another armored train has been captured by the Boers and
wrecked. It is now lying on its side off the rails.
GEN. DULLER
DEPARTS FOR
SOUTH AFRICA
Thousands of Britons Cry
"Good Luck" and "Re
member Majuba."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 14.â General Sir Redvers
Buller, who will have the chief command
in South Africa, left Waterloo station
this afternoon for Southampton to' go
on â¢ board the Dunottar Castle. His de
parture was the occasion of another
patriotic demonstration. General Buller
arrived at the station at 1:45 p. m. With
great difficulty his carriage forced its
way through the crowds that blocked
every approach. The people swarmed
everywhere and gave the station the ap
pearance of a veritable beehive.
- Constant and deafening cheers marked
the approach of the royal carriages con
taining the Prince of Wales and the Duke
of Cambridge, and when Sir Redvers
Buller alighted and appeared in the door
way of the station to receive the Prince
and his former commander in chief en
thusiasm knew no bounds. The immense
waiting-room was temporarily converted
Into a reception-room, where the Secre
tary of State for War, Lord Lansdowne,
Lord Wolseiey; George Wyndham, Parlia
mentary Under Secretary of State for
War; General Sir Evelyn Wood, Colonel
Lord Paul Methuf and a host of other
celebrities were gathered to bid farewell
to General Buller.
The Prince of Wales and the Duke of
Cambridge accompanied him to the tram.
Meanwhile the people filled every avail
able spot within the station, hanging
even from the rafters. Thousands of
throats took up the cries, "Good luck"
and "Remember Majuba." Everybody,
the royal personages included, uncovered
as the train finally moved out of the sta
tion.
SOUTHAMPTON, England, Oct. 14.â
The arrival and embarkation of General
Sir Redvers Buller was the occasion for
a scene of frantic enthusiasm. Thousands
of townspeople and visitors swarmed
near the quay, where the Mayor of
Southampton welcomed General Buller
amid deafening cheers and the waving
of handkerchiefs, hats and walkng
sticks. Sir Redvers smilingly acknowl-
edged the demonstration and went Imme-
diately on board the steamer, entering

HOW BOER ARTILLERY
DESTROYED THE TRAIN
LONDON, Oct. 14.â Further details are
at hand regarding the destruction of the
armored train at Kraaipan. They show
that Captain Nesbitt, who was in com
mand of the train, was warned at Mari
bogo that the Boers held the line. He re
plied that he was bound to proceed.
Nearing Kraaipan the train dashed into a
culvert that had been blown up by the
B.oers, who were lying in wait for the
train. The, Boer artillery immediately
opened fire and a desperate fight ensued,
lasting four hours, with the odds greatly
against the British.
The precise details are uncertain. It
seems, however, that a police patrol at
tracted by the firing approached within
about two thousand yards of Kraaipan,
saw the train ditched, with the Boer ar
tillery still pounding at it, but noticed no
response. The Boers seemed afraid to
approach until the wreck was complete,
and the police patrol feared, as there were
no signs of life near the train, that the en
tire force had perished in a desperate at
tempt to get the train back to Mafeking,
where they knew it was anxiously awaited
with its load of guns and ammunition. It
is reported that the Boers lost heavily,
but there is no means of verifying this.
Two miles of rails were torn up.
VRYBURG. Oct. 13, afternoon (delayed
in transmission).â According to the latest
reports matters so far as the train was
concerned were hopeless as soon as the
artillery began bombarding it. The driver
of the armored train escaped to the veldt
and has turned up at Maribogo, from
which place he telephones that all the
persons on the train except himself were
taken prisoners. An engine has been sent
to Maribogo to bring him here. Besides
emoving the rails the Boers have de
troyed several bridges.
SECOND ARMORED TRAIN
REPORTED DESTROYED
LONDON, Oct. 14.-The Exchange Tele
graph Company has received a dispatch
from Cape Town dated this morning say
ing that the Boers have blown up another
armored train carrying telegraph opera
tors from Mafeking. The Boers, it is re
ported, have destroyed the railway north
of Fourteen Streams, between Vryburg
and Kimberley. Fighting is still continu
ing in the neighborhood.
According to dispatches from the front
the Boers have made several attacks on
Mafeklng, all of which have been re
pulsed.
In connection with the rumored attack
upon Mafeklng a disquieting report comes2
STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE BRITISH
AND BOERS OF LONG DEVELOPMENT
IT was on the Cape of Good Hope
that the white man made his
first settlement in South Africa.
The Dutch, under the auspices of
the Dutch East India Company,
went there in the seventeenth cen
tury. They were followed by Huguenot
refugees In search of the religious free
dom denied them in France. These two
races lived amicably together. Intermar
riages merged them into one blood. That
the Boers, or Dutch Afrikanders, of to
day are a mixed race is evidenced by the
very names of their prominent repre
sentatives. Kruger, the President, for
example, has a name of Holland origin.
Joubert, the Vice President and the com
mandant general of the army, has a
French patronymic. The first British set
tlers arrived toward the close of the eight
eenth century. Trouble at once began to
arise. These troubles culminated in the
conquest of the territory by the British.
In 1814 Holland formally ceded it to Great
Britain. Cape Colony, as it was now
named, has ever since remained a de
pendency of the crown.
The new administration was little to the
liking of the descendants of the original
settlers. Under Holland they had enjoyed
a measure of self-government. I nder
Great Britain they felt themselves aliens.
The crisis of discontent arrived with the
emancipation of their slaves in 1834. Not
only was emancipation itself gainst their
wishes, but the nominal compensation
offered them took the form of orders on
London, which they were forced to cash
on the spot at ruinous discounts. Many of
the farmers were practically Impover
ished. In rage and disgust a large number
of the Boers began to go north and east
into the wilderness. This exodus Is known
as the "great trek" of 1836. Trek is Dutch
for track, or, rather, for the verb which
survives In our macular speech as to
make tracks. The trekkcrs founded the
two colonies of Orange and Natal, whose
northern boundaries were the Vaal River.
They were still claimed as British sub
jects by the Governor of the colony. In
1848 this claim was enforced by conquest.
Once more a large number of the Boers
jumped into their wagons and trekked
across the Vaal In search of independence.
Thus the Transvaal state was founded
and maintained a precarious existence by
whip and rifle in the teeth of constantly
encroaching hordes of hostile savage
tribes But go where they would, the
Boers found that British power and influ
ence were sure to follow. Nor were they
altogether unwelcome at first. "Without
the aid of British arms it Is more than
doubtful whether the white settlements
from Pretoria to the effect that the Rus
tenburg and Marico commandos have
crossed the border and entered the Rooi
grond territory, between Lichtenbui. and
Mafeking, blowing up the bridge over the
Maloppo River and destroying a trainload
of dynamite and the track. As Mafeking
depends upon Rooigrond for its water
supply, the significance of this move is
evident. <
A dispatch from Pretoria dated to-day
says: "General Koch wires from the Na
tal border that his commando has occu
pied Botohas Pass and also captured the
railway station."
The latest reports from Vryhurg say
that the armored train that was dest-j
at Kraaipan contained in addition to Nes
nitt's force a number of workmen and six
residents of Maerigogo, south of Mafe
king, who, on hearing of the Boer ad
vance, took refuge in the train.
Captain Nesbltt, who was killed at
Kraaipan. belonged to the Mashonal and
mounted police. lie served in the Mata
bele war, during which a daring exploit
won him the Victoria Cross. With thir
teen men he fought his way through the
Matabele, relieving a beleaguered party
and escorting them to Salisbury. Three
of the party were killed and five wounded,
all the horses being killed or wounded.
ON THE POINT OF
OFFERING A PROTECTORATE
BERLIN, Oct. 14.â The Dresdener
Nueste Nachrichten publishes a letter
from Colonel Schlel, commander of the
German corps in the Transvaal, who
Bays: "Pretoria was on the point of of
fering Germany a protectorate over the
Transvaal when Great Britain imme
diately moved heaven and earth to frus
trate the plan. War between the Trans
vaal and England then became unavoid
able."
The first Boer success is commented
upon sympathetically by the German
press. The leading military organ, the
Militaire Wochenblatt, says: "Great
Britain underestimates the strength of
the Boer forces, which are 60,000 men,
well equipped. She will need 150,000 thor
oughly equipped troops to subdue them."
ALL KINDS OF STORIES
CIRCULATED IN LONDON
LONDON, Oct. Those who have
been anxious for more stirring news from
the seat of war are getting it to the fullest
extent this morning, as according to dis
patches the shooting must have been al
most continuous along the border of the
Boer republic, while pitched battles have
occurred or are occurring at various
points in Natal and British Bechuanaland.
Most of these reports, however, remain
unconfirmed.
As Mafeklng is cut off telegraphically,
the stories from that point are generally
of Kaffir origin and must be regarded with
-suspicion.
While there is every probability that
General Cronje's big commando has be
gun the assault on Mafeklng, reliable de
tails were still awaited.
Up to this hour there is no authoritative
confirmation of the report that a battle
has been fought in Natal by Sir George
Stewart White and the Orange Free
State troops, although there is no Ques
tion that the Boers have crossed the fron
tier at several points. They are said to
have eighteen guns, but if, as reported,

CONSUL MACRUM TO
GUARD BRITISH INTERESTS
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.â Consul Mac
rum at Pretoria has cabled to the State
Department that he has carried out Its
instructions relative to his assumption
of British Interests and has notified the
Boer Government of the strict neutrality
of the United States. Mr. Macrum will
confine his representation of British in

could have maintained themselves against
the Zulus on their east, the Matabeies on
their west and the Kaffirs in their very
midst. In 1877, however. British annexa
tion proved the price of British protection.
The Boers protested in vain. It was not
until 1881 that they resorted to arms.
Their bloody victory at Majuba Hill
brought the British Government to terms.
By a convention signed at Pretoria in
i v m Mr. Gladstone's government restored
Independence to the Transvaal, now
known officially as the South African
Republic. Independence was subject,
however, to the suzerainty of Great
Britain.
There was no mistaking the meaning of
the word suzerainty as defined In this con
vention. It was expressly stipulated that
the English crown should appoint a
British Resident, with a veto power over
the internal policy of the republic toward
the Kaffirs; that it should control and
conduct its entire foreign policy and re
serve the right of moving troops over its
territory in time* of war.
This claim of suzerainty was, In fact,
only a sop thrown to the British public.
It Is not likely that Gladstone, or Lord
Derby, his Foreign Minister, contemplated
any strict enforcement of its provisions,
or. Indeed, any serious necessity for its
enforcement. The South African Republic
at that time was looked upon as only a
barren tract of land, capable of support
ing a settlement of hardy and simple
minded agriculturists and stock raisers,
but of no imminent interest to England.
To the Boers, however, the reservation
was -ill and wormwood. As they chafed
more and more under what seemed to the
Colonial Office a mere shadow of author
ity. Gladstone cheerfully proposed a re
vision of the convention.
Thus came the conference which led to
the second or London convention of 1884.
'I hough held in the metropolis of Great
Britain itself, the British public thought
little and cared less about the matter.
The Boers got pretty much what they
wanted. Out of deference to Boer sen
sitiveness, the word "suzerainty," ex

was omitted in the new one and the title
of British Resident was changed to Dip
lomatic-Agent, with a restriction of his
functions to purely consular duties. Com
plete independence was granted in do
mestic affairs. The western boundaries
of the state were mutually determined
upon. â  -â â 
Though the word suzerainty was
dropped, the thing Itself was asserted in
one clause, which ran as follows: "The
South African republic will conclude no
treaty or engagement with any state or
nation other than. the Orange Free State,
nor with any native tribe to the eastward
or westward of the republic, until the
terests to the. exercise of his friendly of
fices In case an occasion should arise
therefor with regard to British subjects
and their interests within the jurisdic
tion of the Transvaal and Orange Free
State, It is understood by' the depart
ment that Mr. Macrum is acting in this
connection with the full authority of the
Transvaal Government, whose consent
he asked In advance.
It is thought probable that some of the
mules purchased by the United States
have been sold to British agents. Quar
termaster General Ludlngton found that
he had more mules on hand than were
necessary for the American military ser
vice, and he ordered during the summer
that about 5000 be disposed of. These
have been sold in the South and South
west, where British agents have been
purchasing these animals, and It would
not be surprising If the British Govern
ment should have bought some of those
formerly owned by the United States.

PARISIANS TO SEE NO
MORE BULLFIGHTS
Prefect of Police Closes the Arena at
Enghien Despite the Mayor's
Protest.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, Oct. 15.â The only real breach
of law at the Sunday bull fight was made
by gendarmes, who killed an escaped ani
mal, for the Prefect had issued an order
that under no circumstances were bulls
to be put to death In the ring.
It is true that this particular one was
not in the ring when the gendarmes
brought it down with their army revol
vers, so that detail possibly saved the
situation. It is probable that the Prefect
minded there should be no more similar
usable breaches of the law, for when
the Mayor remained obdurate and refused
to withdraw the authorization he had
given to the organizers of the Corrida
the Prefect determinedly shut up the
arena as defective in construction. So no
more bull fights are likely, at any rate,
for the present.
In the meantime the inhabitants at
Enghien are nervous about the five bulls
that are still In their vicinity. Corraled
they are, it is true, but that is small
consolation to those who saw an animal
leap over a barrier on Sunday and who
noted anything but the solid nature of
the wooden Inclosure where the bulls are
from which it would seem easy for them
to escape. Escape for a bull is much too
easy fur '.he villagers' peace of mind.
The bull fights have been drawn upon
for the latest contribution for autumn
fashions. This is a flat, broad-brimmed
felt hat, exactly similar to one worn by
a torero when in mufti. These hats are
even call-id toreros.
Another detail of fashion Just at pres
net is that seals have become popular
again. As many as a dozen or even more
cunning little contrivances in gold or sil
ver are worn attached to a short watch
chain, as during the empire.
FOR NATIONAL IRRIGATION.
Maxwell's Plan Favorably Received
in Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 14.â "Resolved,
That we heartily indorse the movement
for a national irrigation system as ad
vocated by the National Irrigation Con
gress."
With only two dissenting votes the fore
going resolution was adopted at a meet
ing of the representative citizens of this
city who are interested In the subject of
irrigation at the Chamber of Commerce
this afternoon, and by this action the most
prominent men of the city voiced their
desire to have the Federal Government
take up the subject, which is of such
great interest and Importance to the
western half of the United States. While
the adoption of this resolution cannot be
considered as an expression of disap
proval of the scheme for State Irrigation
it almost amounts to that, for the oppor
tunity was afforded those present to give
expression to their sentiments as to the
State Irrigation matter, and It was decided
to express only the sentiment of the meet
ing with reference to the national plan
that expression being an unqualified in
dorsement.
The meeting was held under the auspices
of the three commercial bodies of the city
for the puropse of hearing a presentation
of the plan of national Irrigation by
George Maxwell, executive chairman
of the National Irrigation- Association and
chairman of the executive committee of
the National Irrigation Congress, the an
nual meeting of which was held last
month in Missoula. Mont. The resolution
(erred to was passed after Mr. Maxwell
had cone uded his remarks in support of

As the other clauses were concessions to
Boer feelings so this was a concession to
John Bull's.. Some years passed before It
was looked upon as of any vital impor
tance. The colonial office winked at some
minor violations of its spirit. Only when
the Boers showed a disposition to en
croach beyond the boundary limitations
of the convention was It aroused, and
even then to tardy action. The Transvaal
Government had its heart set upon two
great aims. One was to shut off Cape Col
ony from the north, the* .other to establish
a seaport of its own.
The conquest of Bechuanaland on the
east would accomplish the first object: the
conquest of Zululand, which stood be
tween it and the ocean In the west, would
accomplish the latter. Tentative raids to
the east and the west were suppressed by
the British authorities, but not until the
boundaries of the South African republic
had been slightly enlarged on both Bides.
In short, the British took so little Inter
est in the matter that it Is not impossible
the Boers might stealthily and gradually '
have succeeded in their double Elm, de
spite the vigilance of Cecil Rhodes and Sir
Hercules Robinson, The discovery of cold
in the "Witwatersrand range "of hills
changed everything. To be sure, the first !
mines exploited In 1886. at. Barberton. col

unique conglomerate deposits In the local
ity where the present city of Johannes- !
burg sprang up. almost In a night, gave!
assurance to the world that one of the I
greatest centers of gold mining known to
all history had been found.
The world was quick to respond. Vast
multitudes of foreigners, chiefly English,
but numbering also Americans, Germans,
French and Austrians. streamed into that
region. The Boers classed them all as
Ultlanders or foreigners. To-day Johan
nesburg, which is practically an English
city, numbers over one. hundred thousand
souls.. Pretoria, the capital of the State,
can muster barely five thousand. To-day
the Ultlander population of the South Af
rican republic is at least twice as large
as that of the Boers. The l.'itlanders not
only have a preponderance In numbers,
but they have the wealth, the Intelligence
and the energy that make numbers tell.
Meanwhile the Boers had awakened to
their imminent peril of being swamped
by this invasion of aliens. They had at
one time welcomed immigration. In 1884
President Kruger. when in London, had
even published an Invitation to English
men to settle In the country. At that
time any settler could secure the electoral
franchise after a residence of two years '

the privilege of the ballot. The proba
tionary term of qualification was raised
first to five years and then to fourteen.
During that probationary term the pros
pective citizen had to forswear allegiance
to any other state. Even at the expira
tion of that term his admission depended
upon the will of the President and of the
Volksraad, or Legislative Assembly.
Thus he might remain forever a man
without a country. His children, even If
born in the republic, were aliens, who
could only gain the rights of citizenship
by the same uncertain processes of nat
uralization. Meanwhile, to increase the
preponderance of Boer domination, the
ballot was thrown open to native chil
dren as scon as they had reached the age
of 16.
Naturally the Ultlanders protested.
They pointed out that though they con
stituted the majority of the state, own
ing half the land and at least nine-tenths
of the property, and paying more than
nine-tenths of the taxes, yet In all mat
ters affecting their lives, their liberties
and properties they had practically no
voice. In 1890 a concession was made to
them. A second Volksraad was created,
for the members of which aliens might
vote after taking the oath and residing
for two years In the country. But as all
the decrees of the second Volksraad are
subject to the approval of the first Volks
raad. this concession conceded little or
nothing.
The Uitlanders had other grievances.
They complained that the taxes were op
pressive and were squandered in the se
cret service and the fortifications at Pre
toria, while Johannesburg remained a
pesthole. They Inveighed against the mo
nopolies granted by the Government, es
pecially the dynamite monopoly, which
placed it in the power of a single Ger
man firm to charge literally a double
price for an Inferior article. They de
nounced the exorbitant freight charges
of the Netherlands Railroad Company,
which owns all the railways In the coun
try and is protected by the Government.
They pointed out that these extortions
made, a serious difference in the profits of
the best mines, threatened the existence
of the second best and had already led
to the abandonment of poorer ones, which
would pay under more liberal conditions.
This discontent reached a crisis In 1896.
The leaders among the Ultlanders had
formed a national union at Johannesburg
which threatened to fight for Its rights.
At this juncture came Dr. Jameson's raid
from British Bechuanaland and his subse
quent defeat, followed by the disarma
ment of Johannesburg. "The belief that
the British Colonial Office had .onnived
at the expedition and the certainty that
Cecil Rhodes had inspired It Increased the
Boer distrust of their hereditary foes and
their unwillingness to make any further
SANTA CRUZ
DEFEATS THE
OAKLANDERS
Visitors From the Seashore
Beat Out the Athenians in
Clever Fashion,
Santa Cruz alighted on "Smiling" Stef
fani's curves at the outset of yesterday's
game and before it closed the visitors
from the city by the sea had netted elev
en hits and ten tallies, a performance
which made the Athenians' twlrler sad
and brought little joy to the hearts of
the Oakland enthusiasts. It was a par
ticularly unhappy day for the Oakland
players. The winning gait assumed by
the "Dudes" was brought to a halt, but
instead of being disheartened the mem
bers of the club are hopeful and expect
to retrieve their defeat to-day.
Steffanl demoralized his teammates in
the first inning by making a fumble of a
bunted ball and throwing wildly to first,
allowing three beachcombers to romp
home. The Oakland pitcher evidently be
came discouraged by his mlsplay, and he
did not pitch up to his usual gait. He
seemed to lack speed and at times con
trol of the sphere. In the third Inning
the "Crabs" connected with his delivery
for five long hits and scored as many
runs, which, added to the three Steffani
presented to them, gave the Santa Cruz
nine a lead that was never overcome.
Oakland made a hearty bid for runs, but
the excellent support given Whelan nipped
their efforts In the bud. Up to the eighth
inning the "Beachcombers" played error
less ball. In that inning McCarthy earned
a black mark by allowing a swift
grounder to pass through his hands. The
runner got no further than the initial
cushion, as McCarthy was cleverly
backed by Clarke. '
The sun came out too late to properly
dry the field, and as a result the players
of both teams gave a highly interesting
gymnastic performance. Schmeer, Bab
bitt and "Handsome" Bill Devereaux did
some cavorting in their positions to bring
endless joy to the small boy, who was not
loth to express his good will when either
of the players named did high and lofty
tumbling for the ball. The game was full
of hard hitting and greatly pleased the
crowd. It took just one hour and ten
minutes to play the first four innings.
This was due to the heavy batting and
slowness of pitchers and players. Umpire
Graves appealed to the men to "smoke
up," and this caused less juggling of the
ball.
Babbitt's work at short was a marvel to
the "fans." He scooped five chances and
with tremendous speed sent the ball to
first always in time to head the runner
off. Streib seemed to be as much at home
on fyst as he is in the field or behind the
hat. Twelve put-outs came his way with
out an error. In Drennan Manager Tut
tle has a splendid fielder. He captured
six difficult flies in center. Whelan
held the Oaklands down to nine hits, but
this was due to the excellent support he
received. What often looked like a safe
hit was converted into an out by fast
fielding. To-day's contests between the
teams should prove lively. "With Borch
concessions. For the moment Jameson's
fiasco cast a damper upon the Ultlanders.
It injured the prestige of Great Britain
in the eyes of the world. It raised the
belief of the Boers In the justice of their
cause and in the continuance of its tri
umph.
That there is a measure of justice on
their side Is evident enough to any Im
partial observer. They are fighting for
self-preservation. However oppressive
their legislation against the Uitlander,
oppression seems to be inevitable if they
wish to retain what is dearest to themâ
their political independence. They have
seen Great Britain gradually hemming
them in on all sides. The annexation of
Matabeleland and of Bechuanaland cut
off their cutlet to the west. The vast ter
ritory of Rhodesia, named after Cecil
Rhodes, to whose genius and enterprise
Great Britain is indebted for its acquisi
tion, lies across their northern boundary.
Portuguese East Africa bars egress to the
northeast. The British occupation of Zt
luland, and finally of the narrow strip
of seacoast reaching from Zululand clear
up to the Portuguese frontier, effectually
dashed the Boer dream of obtaining a
seaport. rs,::-:.. . ,
This last stroke is regarded by Mr.
Bryce as "one of the most important in
recent South African history."
Thus hemmed in only two alternatives
seem open to the Boersâ either suicide by
granting the franchise to a Uitlander ele
ment composed largely of Englishmen,
which, by the sheer force of electoral
majorities roust end in transforming the
Transvaal Into a British dependency, or
death at the hands of Great Britain.
Great Britain has recovered from the
temporary setback of the Jameson raid.
Again she has turned an attentive ear to
the protests of her citizens In the Trans
vaal. Matters were precipitated by the
shooting of one of these citizens, a miner
named Edgar, while resisting the unlaw
ful entry Into his home of a Boer police
man, who, without a warrant, sought his
arrest on the charge of .assault. It was
shown that the assault had been com
mitted in self-defense upon an abusive
drunkard. Nevertheless, the policeman
was not only acquitted but praised by the
presiding judge.
It was this incident that led up to the
present agitation. The flame was fanned
when Uitlander meetings of protest were
broken up by organized bands led by
Government officials. A body known as
the Uitlander Council was formed, with
representatives from the mines and the
towns. For the first time in its history
Uitlander Johannesburg stood firm and
united. Appeals were made to Sir Alfred
Mllner, who In 1897 was appointed Gov
ernor of Cape Colony and High Commis
sioner for South Africa. In reviewing the
ers or Harper in the box, Oakland ought
to continue Its winning gait. Following

Government sustained his view.
The result was a meeting between Sir
Alfred Milner and President Kruger on
May 30, 1899, at a conference at Bloeni
fontein, the capital of the Orange Free
State, The conference left matters in
statu quo. President Kruger had been
empowered by the Volksraad to propose
conferring the franchise upon aliens five
years after eligibility to the second Raad,
thus substituting a nine years' residence
in the territory for the fourteen at
present exacted. He proposed that other
questions in dispute should be submitted
to arbitration. Sir Alfred's reply, in sub
stance, was that on any vital matter
there could be no arbitration between a
suzerain state and its dependency.
Kruger refused to consider any terms
which did not recognize the independence
of the Transvaal.
The Boer contention, in fact, is that as
the word "suzerainty" was deliberately
left out of the London convention, British
suzerainty no longer exists. The English
argument is that suzerainty exists ipso
facto in the veto power confirmed to the
Queen by the London convention in all
the Transvaal's dealings with foreign na
tions. A state which is prohibited from
managing its foreign affairs in its own
way cannot, it is argued, be- called an in
dependent state.
But the struggle, though hopeless, will
be a terrible one. The Boers in the Trans
vaal claim the ability to mobilize 20,000
men in three days. They expect that a
thousand Germans in Johannesburg will j
join them. They will be led in person by- j
General Piet Joubert, who holds the
double position of Vice President of the |
republic and commandant general of Its j
forces. The sexagenarian veteran, who |
has proved his mettle against the say- j
ages and against English troops, grimly .
announced that in the event of a declara
tion of war he would capture Natal 'n
three days. But it is not the Boers in the
Transvaal only that are to be reckoned
with. Orange Free State is more Dutch
than English. Since 1554 it has been in
dependent of England. Its President, M.
T. Steyn, is in sympathy with President
Kruger. Even in Cape Colony the Dutch
greatly outnumber all the other whites.
A civil war in the very heart of the Brit
ish dominions in Africa is not an impossi
ble event. And it must never be forgot
ten that in those dominions there is a
murmurous mats of savages, outnumber
ing the whites ten to one, who love the
English even less than they do the Boers,
and who may take advantage of an inter
necine conflict among the whites to fall
upon both parties or to cast their lot with
the lesser enemy.

THE IDOL OF THE TURF.
The Most Popular Jockey in America
and England Recommends
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
No jockey has ever appealed so strongly
to public favor as Tod Sloan.
He has achieved more than his most
noted predecessors ever attempted and
stands in a class by himself.
Not satisfied with his successes in his
native country, he went to England and
now his fame as a successful horseman is
on the tip of every tongue not only in
this country and England, but in every
section of the globe where racing has
found favor.
When Tod first went to England his
temerity was openly laughed at, but the
little American played skittles with his
English rivals and his victories made all
England gasp.
Having the stamp of royal approval,
society both at home and abroad "lion-
ize" him and he is feted and petted to an
extent that would turn an ordinary mor-
tal's head.
The great jockey was in such demand
socially and dined and wined to such an
extent that it was feared his health
would give way. Too much society and
the nervous strain of racing told on him.
A two weeks' trip to America made him
acquainted with Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets and their remarkably restorative ef-
fects on a depleted digestive apparatus
and he recommended them in unstinted
terms to a friend, saying: "Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are the best thing 1 know
of for keeping the stomach in condition
and appetite in good repair."
Thousands of former dyspeptics can
vouch for the truth of Tod Sloan's words,
as "Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets" have be-
come a household word in America, and
few families are without them. One or
two taken after meals keep the stomach
sweet by causing prompt and healthy di-
gestion of the food.
Perfectly healthy people use them after
heavy dinners to keep their good health
and to make sure that no ill effects will
follow an unusually hearty meal.
Your druggist will tell you or your doc-
tor either that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are composed only of digestive ferments
Asceptic Pepsin, Hydrastis, fruit acids'
etc., and for the strong stomach as weli
as the most delicate constitute a safe-
guard against indigestion and stomach
troubles. â

BOSTON, Oct. 14.â The residents of
Boston and vicinity, augmented by
thousands of visitors from other sections
of the commonwealth and from adjacent
States, to-day did honor to Admiral
Dewey.
The hearty greying with which Ad
miral Dewey was received when he ar
rived last night was completely over
shadowed to-day whenever the famous
Vormonter appeared In public, and par
ticularly as he i ode through the city In
the front ranks of the brilliant naval
and military pageant, which was the
chief event of the 'ay.
The demonstration was really one in
which all tho States from Eastern Can
ada to Long Island Sound united to ac
knowledge the honors due to the great
naval leader and his men for their tri
umph In the bay of Manila. Some of
ihe New England States sent their Gov
ernors and some a number of their other
prominent men. From all parts came
large delegations.
Boston to-day was decorated as the
city seldom has been. Tho route of the
parade presented a mass of color. Pic
tures of Admiral Dewey seemed to be
everywhere, and there were few private
residences throughout the city that did
not throw colors to the breeze. Tho
streets, avenues and squares through
which the parade passed were dressed
mainly under the direction of an ar
chitectural committee, and a system
i.tic plan had been followed In the ar
rangements of colors, which .-.â¢suited in
most picturesque and harmonious com
binations.
Dewey was up early and with Lieu
tenant Brumby took a short constitu
tional across Boston Common. After
breakfast the admiral received Mayor
Quincy and later he gave a few minutes'
reception to the newspaper men of the
city. The admiral was in the full dress
of his rank.
At 0 o'clock a rpecial committee depu
tized to conduct the admiral to the chil
dren's exercises on the Common arrive I
ami a few minutes later came the com
mittee on the part of the city, headed by
Mnyor Quincy. While these visitors

Office hoursâ From 9 a in. to 12m. ; from
1 to 6 p. m.; evenings, Tuesdays and Fri-
days. Sundays, from 10 a. m. to 12 m.
were In the admiral's sitting-room Cap- I
tain Dyer of the Baltimore and several
other naval officers, guests of the city
of Boston, arrived. Just as the party was
about to take carriages for Boston Com
mon members of the Boston Traveler
staff appeared and presented the ad
miral with a beautiful sword, the cost
of which was met by dime contributions
from the people of Boston. Then Mr.
Dyer and four members of his staff were
admitted. Last came Captain Lamber
ton of the Olympla.
It was just before 10 o'clock when the
admiral got away from the hotel. On the
street the ovation which followed 1..m
was most enthusiastic. The Mayor and
the admiral's aid were In the second car
riage, the first being occupied by the
school committee delegations. In other
carriages were the naval officers ana
other gentlemen who had been invited to
accompany the admiral. The party pro
ceeded to the common, where more than
25,000 of the school children*, carrying flags
and guidons, were drawn up In two col
umns about 1500 feet long and ten to
twenty deep. The children sang Amer
ica" a's soon os the carriages arrived, the
municipal band accompanying them and
the thousands of spectators joining in the
chorus. , . . ,
At the last verse the carriages started
down the aisle between the columns of
children and the singing changed to
cheers and waving of flags. The band
played "The Star-Spangled Banner, the
carriages returned through the aisles and
then passed rapidly out Into Beacon street
on the way to the City Hall, where the
presentation of the magnificently jeweled
watch on behalf of the city of Boston
and tho freedom of the city was to be
made. . .
The enthusiasm which greeted the ad
miral upon his arrival at the City Hall
equaled that which he received on the
common. His carriage drew up at the
entrance to the City Hall at 10:14 and the
admiral at once ascended the stand erect
.-.; in front of the building, which was
decorated in bunting and evergreens.
By the stand at the City Hall 280 trained
singers from the Handel and Haydn So
ciety were seated. As the admiral and his
party appeared upon the stand the society
. Eang "See, the Conquering Hero Comes, '
! to which the admiral listened, chapeau In
hand, and at the close of which he step
pod forward and acknowledged the recep
tion with repeated bows. The action
called forth a great wave of cheers, which
Mayor Quincy checked with uplifted hand.
The Mayor then delivered the address
of presentation to the distinguished guest,
who remained seated at the Mayor's sug
gestion. Mayor Quincy characterized the
battle of Manila Bay as "the greatest
since Trafalgar." He said:
The people of America are not ungrateful.
They would gladly bestow upon you any
honor, even the highest within their gift.
They give you their homage because
by one hard and daring blow, delivered
SOOO miles from an American port, you de
stroyed the foundation of the Asiatic power of
Spain, arM thus earned the right to be called
a peacemaker by greatly hastening the close
of the war.
But 1 believe that It 1* far more the quali
â¢â :â¢â¢Â« you afterward displayed In the year of
arduous and delicate service which followedâ
a service unexampled In Its character In our
own historyâ have won for you such
unique manifestations of the respect and affec
tion of 74.CC0.000 people.
Our people love you as an example of great
devotion to high duty. In our national per
plexities arising from the strange and strain
ing difficulties which confront us in the Phil
ippines, we turn to you, who know the condi
i tions so well, for counsel, for guidance, for
1 still further service.
The government of Boston now desires to pre
sent to v-ou. Admiral Dewey, a gift which you
' may take away as a slight token of our grati
; tude for your services to the country, of the
special pride which we fee! in you as a son
I of New Enclnnd and as a memento of this
memorable visit. The suggestion of a watch
i as a suitable present came from one of your
; shipmates. We offer it to you upon a silver
trnv. which will hand down to your descend
ants' in a more enduring form than parchment
the inscription engraved upon It formally ex
tending to you the freedom of the city of
Boston. May the time which this watch shall
mark deal gently with you and may you he
long spared to serve your country In whatever
station she may most need you.
Admiral Dewey appeared greatly moved
at the Mayor's remarks. The crowd re-
I newed Its cheering as the admiral arose to
receive the gift of the city. He said:
Mr. Mayor: I wish to thank you for your
kind and "complimentary remarks. I wish also
to thank, through you. the citizens of this city
for this present, for Its freedom and for this
, grand ovation, the like of which no living man
has even seen. I think. The ovation which
i was given me last night. I believe, has never
! been equalled within the life time of any of us
âat any event. I never saw the equal of it. I
thank you very much Indeed.
This ended the part of the programme
allotted to the city government with the
exception of the later entertainment pro
vided for the officers and men of the
Olympia. The admiral, was driven to
Back Bay, where the parade was in prog
ress of formation, and the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts assumed the direction
of affairs.
The militia of the State was rapidly as
sembling when the admiral arrived and
the formation was soon completed. Soon
after noon the great column of military
bodies moved. Admiral Dewey, with Lieu
tenant Governor W. Murray Crane, occu
pied a carriage near the head of the line,
preceded by Governor Roger Wolcott,
mounted, and his staff. i\^'-*-'2,
The sailors and marines of the Olympia,
next to their famous commander, held
thÂ« interest of the spectators. The vari

mobilized for this particular occasion not
only to assist In the festivities, but also
to return to the custody of the State the
colors borne by them during the Spanish
war were freely applauded. Several
companies of United States Artillery and
the veterans of the G. A. R. were also
warmly recleved. .
At the City Hall Mayor Quincy reviewed
the men. At the State House the admiral
and Governor Woleotb and staff left the
line and took up a position on the State
House steps, where they remained while
the parade passed in review on its way
to the common, where the colors
carried by those regiments which
were in the Spanish war were
formally surrendered to the State with
Impressive ceremonies. The exercises were
viewed by Admiral Dewey, who. with
Governor Wolcott and staff, was escorted
to the parade ground by the men of the
The admiral was driven to the Hotel
Touraine. As the admiral left the com
mon the color camp of each regiment ad
vanced to the front from Its position on
the line and formed behind the colors. The
battalion, with Governor Wolcott ahead,
marched to the State House, where the
colors were delivered into the custody of
the adjutant general, later to be placed
with other Massachusetts battle flags In
Doric Hall.
Meanwhile the parade at the common
had been dismissed and the Individual
commands marched to the armories or
railroad stations for embarkation to their
homes. The crew of the Olympta was
taken In charge by a committee and con
ducted to the Tremont Temple, where a
banquet was served. In the evening they
were given entertainment in various
places.
The day's events for the admiral ended
with a reception and banquet at the Al
gonquin Club, at which Governor Wolcott
proposed the toast, "Admiral Dewey and
the United States Navy." The admiral
acknowledged the toast in a few words.

Steamer Nutmeg State, Burned at Sea.
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â The Bridge
port line steamer Nutmeg State
was burned in Long Island Sound,
off Sands Point, L. 1., at sunrise
this morning and ten persons were
burned to death or drowned. The dead
are:
SAMUEL JAYNES, Bridgeport, bag
gagemaster of Nutmeg State; body at
New York Morgue.
NILS NILSON, member of the crew;
body not recovered from the wreck.
CHARLES ANDERSON, watchman on
board; body In the wreck.
PATRICK COFFEY, mate; body In the
wreck.
BERNARD HANCOCK; body in the
wreck.
THOMAS MURPHY, member of the
crew; body in the wreck.
JOHN CONNORS, member of the crew;
body in the wreck.
Unknown woman, passanger, 28 years of
age; body recovered.
Unknown man, passenger; drowned;
body not recovered.
Unknown girl, 4 years old; body re
covered.
Most of the passengers who escaped
suffered nothing more than shock from
Immersion in the chilly water, and only
four persons were sent to the hospital.
The steamer was run to the beach at
the outbreak of the flames and burned to
the water's edge.
The bodies of two victims of the disas
ter drifted ashore a mile east of the blaz
ing wreck. One was the body of a wo
man about 28 years of age, and the other
a girl of four years.
The Nutmeg State, with over 100 per
sons on board, bound from Connecticut
towns to New York, was discovered on
fire at about 5:30 o'clock, when she was
within a few miles of Sands Point, L. I.
The flames were In the bow of the boat,
between the forward cabin and the don
key engine room. The fire was on the
main deck and seemed to be a small af
fair, so Captain C. A. Brooks, not wish
ing to needlessly alarm the passengers,
ordered the crew called to work as quick
ly as possible with buckets and hose. For
about twenty minutes the flames did not
seem to be dangerous, and the men ap
peared to have them In control. Sud
denly they burst into a furious blaze
amidships.
Samuel Jaynes was detached from the
fire fighters and sent to alarm the pas
sengers and all the members of the crew

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ED PASO, Tex.. Oct. 14.â A special to
the Herald from Pima, Ariz., via Bowie,
says: Last night at midnight the colored
soldiers of Company C. Twenty-fifth
United States Infantry, now stationed at
San Carlos reservation, disguised them
selves as Indians and, slipping upon a
band of Apaches camped near the post,
attacked them with clubs and bayonets.
The Indians thus suddenly aroused
made a brave resistance, but were lit
erally beaten down with clubs until many
were seriously injured and four dead. The ;
survivors fled to the mountains. An alarm
was sounded at the post, but the majority
of the soldiers escaped back without being
found out. Efforts are being made by the
authorities to find the assailants. The
garrison la under arms.
The attack was caused by the Intimacy
of the negroes with the Indian women.
The Indians resented this and retaliated I
by mutilating a negro In atrocious Indian j
style and the attack followed. The sit
uation Is grave, as the Indians are
aroused and gathering. A general^ up
rising U threatened and the agent fears
"Tt 1 Is feared the funeral rites at the
burial of the dead will Incite the surviv
ors to attack the whites. A detachment
of the Twenty-fifth Infantry stationed
here is held ready to be sent to the aid of
the San Carlos garrison if necessary.
FRENCH PORTIA WILL
DEFEND CONSPIRATORS
Mile. Jeanne Cliauvin Engaged to
Look After the Interests of
M. Cailly.
cr^inl Cable to The Call and the New York
P Heral'l L Copyrighted, 1899. by James Gor
don Bennett. -s .<-.*.
PARIS, Oct. 14.â 1t must be admitted
that the* conspirators now awaiting trial
are anything but a melancholly band. One
of them, M. Callly, member of the Anti-
Semitic League, received a big basket of
peaches a few days ago. The fruit was
carefully packed with fig leaves. After
eating the peaches M. Callly gravely sent
the leaves, with his compliments, to M.
Berenger, who is not only president of
the high court before which M. Callly
and his fellow prisoners will be tried, but
also Is president of the League for Pro
tection of Morality, an association that
devotes its attention particularly to in
suring decency in public.
M. Berenger, or "Father Chastity," as
he Is honorably nicknamed, only laughed,
but he was rather staggered when a little
later M. Cailly Bent him word that at the
trial he would be defended, not by a
lawyer,- but by a lawyeresa, Mile. Jeanne
Chauvin, the first and so far the only
woman to be admitted to the French bar.
You will remember the stubborn fight she
made after she had won all the diplomas
to be allowed to practice her profession.
It is only a few months since the Cham
ber of Deputies, after a Demosthenean
speech by M. Rene Vivian!,- brokÂ« down
trie last barrier that prevented women
pleading in the Palace of Justice, and the
who were In the forward part of the boat.
He ran through the passageways on the
several decks, shouting to the passengers
and the sleeping crew. He remained amid
ships, crying out warnings until he was
forced by the flames to jump overboard.
The passengers. in various stages of
frenzy, rushed from the staterooms to the
upper decks. Life preservers were given
them, and many of the men assisted In
putting them on the women and children.
By this time the entire middle section
of the Nutmeg State was burning fiercely,
and the persons forward were completely
cut off from communication with those on
the after part of the boat. This left those
people on the rear decks in a perilous sit
uation, as the lifeboats on the amidship
davits were surrounded by flames and
there were few of the crew in the rear to
give aid. -
As the flames continued to spread both
forward and aft the pilot headed the
steamboat at full speed for the beach at
Sands Point
The draft swept the Are toward the
rear of the boat. The passengers in that
part of the boat went as far back on
the rear deck as possible, but were en
veloped by black smoke and the flames
were leaping toward them, threatening
In a few moments to roast them alive.
They huddled close to the rear rail in
fear", waiting for the steamer to strike
the beach. With a shock the Nutmeg
State struck the rock bottom, and hu
man bodies seemed to shoot from all
parts of her like shot from a sling. The
passengers Jumped into the water and
tried to reach the lifeboats which had
been launched from the forward part of
the vessel. All the passengers were In
the water but a few moments, but many
of the members of the crew had become
Imprisoned In the forward part of the
ship, below decks, by the flames. There
was no outlet in the thick sides of the
steamboat except the small portholes,
through which no man could squeeze.
The first person to leave the burning
steamer was Baggagemaster Jaynes, who
gave the alarm to the sleeping passen
gers. When the smoke and flames forced
him from amidships he was almost ex
hausted and made a leap for the sea.
His head struck against the guard rail
and he was stunned, falling Into thewater
helplessly. A launch from the steam
yacht Kismet picked him up and carried
him to the Kismet, where the brave fel
low died shortly after being taken aboard.
The Nutmeg State had hardly struck
the beach when several passing craft
came to her rescue, sent out lifeboats and
picked up the passengers struggling In
the water.
An unknown woman passenger, al
though provided with a life belt, was seen
council of order had to inscribe Jeanne
Chauvln's name upon the list of bar
risters.
One curious consequence of M. Callly's
appeal to tho young lawyeress Is that if
she agrees to undertake his defense it will
be the first time a woman will have
spoken in the Senate.
BIG JEFFRIES IS NOT
TRAINING FAITHFULLY
Such Is the Report That Comes From ;
the Camp of the Pugilistic
Champion.
NEW YORK, Oct. There were two
stories in circulation to-night as to the i
cause of Jeffries' injury. One was that it j
was due entirely to an accident and the
other was to the effect that It was due to
something more serious than a collision
with a medicine ball. The champion's
face Is covered by a peculiar eruption, the
report said, and in consequence he was
declared to have been neglecting his I
training. It was pointed out that on sev- j
eral occasions he has left his training !
quarters at 9 o'clock in the morning and ]
failed to return until late in the after-
There Is one conspicuous feature of Jef
fries' training, and that is lack of har
mony In camp. "Billy" Delaney has ex
pressed himself several times as being
dissatisfied with the champion's actions,
and It Is said he has threatened to cease
to assume responsibility for the Callfor
nlan's condition until Jim" changes his
ways.

The Santa Clara College team this after
noon defeated the Stanford freshmen on
the campus by a score of 12 to 0. The
college team was heavier than the fresh
men, who were further handicapped
' through the absence of three of their
best players, who were out on account of

Will Rebuild at Whittier.
PASADENA, Oct. 14.-The new building
of the Whittier Reform School will go
up despite Attorney General Ford's opin
ion that no appropriation can be had now.
Trustee James Clark of this city went to
Whittier to-day to arrange for the erec
tion of the building. He says it must be
built, because since the fire of a few
months ago the boys and girls have been
eating under a large tent which will not
do now that the wet season has begun.
The board of examiners on recommenda
tion of the trustees made an appropria
tion of $15,000 for the work. Assembly
man Melick says that In all probability
the Legislature will allow the appropria
tion, as the Legislature is always gen
erous In cases of emergency like this
Ito fall back to the blazing deck. A man
I passenger who was trying to keep him-
I self afloat on an oar became exhausted
; and was drowned.
When it became apparent that the Nut
: meg State was doomed to destruction the
I dozen or so of her freight handlers are
; said to have taken possession of the first
;of the lifeboats launched. They fought
; back any of the women or men who tried
i to get into the boat and refused to take
; the children. It was impossible for Cap
-1 tain Brooks to control the rowdy, cow
ardly freight handlers and they were ut
i terly oblivious of the perils of the pas
', sengers.
! When the passengers were forced from
! this lifeboat it doubled the demands on a
; second which was low-red, and a wild
scramble of the panic-stricken people en
; sued. This boat was overloaded and
â¢ overturned. It could not be righted In
the water and men, women and children
remained In the chilly water, clinging to
; the boat until help arrived from the pass
. ing craft.
The tugboat Reed ran under the stern
of the Nutmeg State and some of the pas
, sengers jumped from the burning boat to
the decks. Then the tug went forward
i and made an effort to save the imprisoned
men in the crew quarters. The heat was
so intense that it drove the tug away and
It again turned Its attention to picking
, the people up from the water.
: It made another attempt and some of
the tug's men chopped away some wood
work at the bow of the Nutmeg State.
Two of the firemen were saved, but the
other men of the crew, who probably
were exhausted from the smoke, were un
able to climb out of the hold before the
: Reed was again forced away from the
' ship on account of the flames.
i It Is believed that seven men of the
j Bridgeport boat were burned to death In
I their quarters below decks at the bow.
The passengers and rescued members
! from the burning ship were placed aboard
'â  the City of Lawrence, and the body of
', Baggagemaster Jaynes was conveyed to
! the Hartford liner, which proceeded on
her way to this city. Of the seventy of
the rescued aboard only four needed hos
pital treatment.
The excitement was such at the time
of the abandonment of the burning vessel
that no positive statement as to the exact
number of persons who perished ran be
obtained from the officers of the boat or
! from any of the persons rescued. No
record of those on board was kept by the
; purser, because the United States naviga
; tion laws do not require coastwise craft
making regular trips of less than a hun
| dred miles to make a list of passengers.
The Nutmeg State was a wooden propel
: ler of a little over a thousand tons, and
: for the last, seven years has carried
freight and passengers between Connecti
cut towns and this city. She carried a
! large quantity of freight, which was all
destroyed. There was a large consign
: ment of cartridges in the hold, and when
j the flames reached them they began to
I explode and continued firing for some
time. The boat was valued at $70,000.

NEW TORK, Oct. 14.â Columbia j
and Shamrock got as far as the starting !
line to-day, but did not cross it. There j
was not enough wind to blow out the sig- j
nal flags when the time came to send |
them away, and after waiting an hour in j
the hope that a breeze might spring up j
from somewhere, the committee boat
hoisted the now familiar blue flag crossed
by a white bar, denoting that the race
was off for the day. The usual fleet of
excursion boats, yachts and tugs was on
hand to witness the melancholy announce- !
ment. After the yachts had returned to
their anchorage inside the Horseshoe, and
the tail of the excursion fleet had disap
peared through â¢ the Narrows, a good,
strong breeze blew in from the sea and
held throughout the afternoon. With such
a breeze the boats could have covered the
course in four hours.
The yachts will try again on Monday,
but the old barnacles are now saying that
unless a storm comes along to stir up the
stagnant atmosphere there Is not much \
chance of a change in the weather condi- j
tions until the moon changes on Wednes- j
day.
The Shamrock, with her mainsail up.
left her moorings In tow of a tug at 8:50
a. m., the Columbia following her at 9
o'clock. Both arrived at the lightship

did about the lightship being done under

\ persons were on board the yachts as on
; the previous days.
The yachts returned to their moorings
;at 1:30 The Shamrock's crew swung the
I main boom off to starboard, and eleven
j men climbed out on its head and sat there
| to give the yacht a heel while several of
) the crew scrubbed off one of the plates
I on the port side below the water line.
i These operations were repeated, the boom
I being swung to port and the men cleaning
| the starboard side.
It was reported after the race was de
clared off that there had been talk of
docking both yachts early on Sunday
morning, but the rumor was not con
firmed. The fact that Captain Charles
Barr of the Columbia obtained leave from
Mr. Iselin to go to the city to meet his
wife, who arrived to-day from England by
the steamer St. Paul, and to remain In
town until Monday morning. Is pretty
good evidence that the Columbia will not
be docked.
Captain Robley D. Evans visited the
Erin this morning, and "Fighting Bob"
and Lord Charles Beresford shook hands.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ABERDEEN, S. D., Oct. 14.âPresi
dent McKinley's special arrived In this
city over the Milwaukee line at 8 o'clock
this morning. At the depot a large crowd
gathered to see the first President of the
j United States who had ever visited the
! Dakotas since their Statehood.
The First South Dakota Volunters, who
arrived to-day from the Philippines, fell
in line behind an escort of G. A. R. vet
erans, who followed ' immediately after
the carriage of the President and Cabi
net. Colonel Frost rode at the head of
his regiment, and as they passed down to
the reviewing stand and the Grain Palace
j the 5000 inhabitants of Aberdeen cheered
I and were reinforced by several thousand
I vistors from other parts of the State.
Addresses were made by President Mc-
Ivinley and members of the Cabinet, Gov
ernor Leo and others. The President
said:
Mr. Mayor, Members of the First Dakota Vol
! unteers and Fellow Citizens: It gives me very
great pleasure to join with your fellow citizens
1 of South Dakota, your friends, your families,
your neighbors, in this welcome to your home.
We are not a nation of hero worshipers, and !
yet we are a nation of seventy millions of
grateful people, who love valor and reward the
heroic deeds of our soldiers, and, I think. I ap
preciate quite as much if not more than most I
of my fellow citizens the value of the services
this regiment, with its associates of the Eighth ;
Corps, rendered the country In Its hour of great !
emergency. 7 '
1 am here to speak not for myself alone, but i
for the American people In expression of grat
itude and thanks for your heroic action in the
island of Luzon. I have with me this morn
ing a dispatch just received from your com
mander, the major general commanding In the
Philippines, telling me of the gallantry of
Colonel Frost and his First Regimentâ telling
me that from early In February until late in
June you stood on the firing line and no enemy
could resist your onslaughts upon them.
Nor can I forget, soldiers of the republic,
that when the treaty of peace was pending,
when negotiations were being conducted In
Paris, when the ratification of the treaty was
awaiting the action of the Senate, and, finally,
when we were awaiting the exchange of the
ratification with Spainâ l do not forget that
when that time came every one of you was
entitled to be mustered out of the service of the
United States, and I can never express the joy
you gave my heart when you sent word that
you would remain until a new army could be
formed to take your places. That, members of
the First South Dakota, was an example of
personal sacrifice and public consecration rarely
known In the annals of war, but it is Just like
the American soldier. No matter where he
comes from, he never lays down his arms in
the presence of an enemy, and he never lowers
the flag of his country until he has triumphed
over enemies who assail It.

are all licked.)

The train bearing the Presidential party
left Aberdeen at 11:30 o'clock.
REDFIELD, S. D., Oct. 14.âPresi
dent McKlnley and party reached this
city at 12:50 o'clock this afternoon, on the
Chicago and Northwestern Railway. A
speakers' stand had been erected near the
depot, and on three sides of it the streets
were jammed with people anxious to hear
the Chief Executive. The President spoke
at some length and the telling points of
his address were greeted with applause.
Several hundred school children were in
the audience. The President said in part:
We have been adding some territory U> the
United States. The little folks have to get a
new geography. We have a good deal more
territory in the United States than when we
were boys, and we have been adding some
within the last eighteen months. We have not
only been adding territory to the United States,
but we have been adding character and pres
tige to the American name. We have planted
our flag in Porto Kico, Hawaii and in the Phil
ippines. We planted it there because we had
a right to plant It there. We 'had' a war with
Spain. Every effort i was made to avert it. I
used every effort at peace before war was fin
ally declared by the Congress of the United
States, but when war was declared there was
but one thing fur the American people to do,
and that was to destroy the Spanish sea power
wherever we could find it. and so we pent
Dewey to Manila and we told him to go there,
commence operations, find the Spanish fleet
and capture or destroy It. He did it. He found
and destroyed it. and when he had done that
then we had the responsibility of the Philip
pines, which we could not evade.
And there has never been a moment of time,
my countrymen, when we could have left Ma
nila Bay or Manila harbor or the archipelago
of the Philippines without dishonor to our
name. We did not go there to conquer the
Philippines. We went there to destroy the
Spanish fleet that we might end the war, but
in the providence of God. who works in mys
terious ways, this great archipelago was put
Into our lap, and the American people never
shirk duty. And the flag now there Is not the
flag of tyranny; It Is the flag of liberty, and
wherever the flag goes character, education,
American intelligence, American civilization
and American liberty go.
The Cabinet members also spoke brief
ly. Bartlott Tripp, former Embassador
to Austria and member of the Samoan
joint commission, boarded the Presiden
tial train here and remained with the
party until Yankton was reached.
SIOUX FALLS, S. D.. Oct. 14.â The i
Presidential special arrived in this city j
i to-night shortly after 7. Elaborate prep- '
' ations had been made for the reception.
Carriages in waiting at the depot bore the
President and party to the speakers'
stand at Ninth street and Main avenue,
immediately behind the President's car
riage marched G. A. R. veterans. School
children brought up the rear. Fully 15.000
persons crowded around the speakers'
stand and cheered wildly when the Presi
dent appeared with Mayor B. H. Lien at
his side. Judge H. H. Keith introduced
the President.
President McKinley's speech was
cheered to the echo as were also the
short addresses made by members of the
Cabinet.
Companies B and D of the Second South
Dakota Volunteers, just returned from
the Philippines, participated in the pa
rade and were reviewed by the President.
At the conclusion of the speeches the
Presidential party was driven to the Great
Northern station and departed for Yank
ton. ____^^____ ___

The Prompt Way to Cure Yourself When Symptoms
Show That Your Kidneys Are Out of Order.
To Test the Wooderful Merits of the Great Modern
Discovery, Swamp-Root, Every "Call" Reader
May Have a Sample Bottle Ser)t Free by Mail.
The way to be well is to pay atten-
tion to your kidneys.
They are the most Important organs
of the body the blood filters.
All the blood in your body passes
through your kidneys once every three
minutes.
The kidneys strain or filter out the
impurities in the bloodâ is their
work.
Purifying your blood is not a question
of taking a laxative or physic.
Does your blood run through your
bowels?
What the bowel-cleaner does Is to
throw out the poisons confined in your
bowels ready for absorption into your
blood, but the poisons which are al-
ready in your blood, causing your pres-
ent sickness, it leaves there.
There is no other way of purifying
your blood except by means of your
kidneys.
That is why bowel-cleaners fail to
do their workâ they fail to help the
kidneys.
When you are sick, then, no matter
what you think the name of your dis-
ease is, the first thing you should do is
to afford aid to your kidneys by using
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great
Kidney Remedy.
In taking Swamp-Root you afford
natural help to nature, for Swamp-Root
is the most perfect healer and gentle
aid to the kidneys that is known to

EDWARD ATKINSON
DEPRECATES WAR
Sees a Way to "Eternal
Peace."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 14.â to-day's
session of the Commercial Congress Ed
ward Atkinson spoke in favor of tariff
and currency reform. Referring to Kaut's
essay, "Eternal Peace," and its predic
tion of the suppression of war by force
of mutual commercial benefits, he said:
We seem to be far away and yet we are
nearer to that conclusion than ever before;
perhaps very near. The terrible cost of prep
aration for war is becoming: an unbearable
burden to any European state. The present
forms of society cannot exist much longer
under its pressure: it Is leading, to anarchy.
When such men as Roosevelt 'set up the
"strenuous life" of the soldier as a worthy
object of attainment in and for itself rather
than -an obnoxious necessity as a matter of
national defense, I can only pity the ignorance
which leads to such a vicious conclusion.
He expressed the opinion that the
dawning century would witness the sup
pression of the hell of war by the "bene
ficent force of commerce." He concluded
by drawing a comparison 1 between the ef
fects of commerce and war. The for-
mer, he said, was governed by "probity,
Integrity, truth and a high standard of
character, mutual trust and mutual ser
vice, and while its motive is gain it is
not at the cost of others, but to mutual
benefit." â â â¢ '-.: 'â -.-,- Â»v- s.-iiv-v â - '--:â¢.'â¢â 
Admitting that the conduct of a war
had developed high and noble qualities
and in defense of liberty was justifiable
and sometimes necessary, he maintained
that its motive was "to lie, to cheat, to
ambush, to strike the enemy in the back
or on the flank, to secure the gun or
other instrument of carnage by which his
forces may be slaughtered without power
of defense on his part; often to destroy
his property, to devastate his country
and by every evil method that would be
thought dishonorable and fraudulent in
commerce to secure the ends that are
sought in warfare." >*>^ ; .'
The other speakers were Henry Miles,
representative of the Montreal Board of
Trade; J. H. Sternberg of Pennsylvania:
A. D. Tompkins of North Carolina, on

FORTUNE LEFT
IN AN ALMANAC
Contest Over Wilcox
son's Estate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 14.â Interest in
creases in the suit of Miss Amanda P.
Austin against the estate of Millionaire
Jefferson Wilcoxson, deceased, and as the
case proceeds It develops many unusual
features.
Jefferson Wilcoxson was one of the best
known capitalists in this section and there
was scarcely a bank in the interior in
which he was not a stockholder or In
some Important way interested, while his
land holdings were far scattered and
large. He was a bachelor, and about
twenty years ago, when years began to
tell on him, he sent to Missouri for his
niece, Miss Amanda P. Austin. For eight
een years she was his nurse and constant
companion. No daughter could have been
more dutiful, and fully a score of wit
nesses have testified that old man "Wll
coxson never missed an opportunity to
praise her, to speak of the gratitude he
felt for her and to declare that on his
death she would find herself amply pro
vided for.
Prior to his last illness Wileoxson deed
ed over to his sixteen nephews and nieces
something: like $-500,000. One only was ex
cepted and that one was his niece Aman
da, but many witnesses have testified tnat
ho often said that while he had not deed
ed any property to Amanda she would !
find herself at his death amply rewarded .
for her services.
Upon the death of Wileoxson a little
safe ln his office on Seventh street, this
city, was opened and $170,000 in green
backs was found sandwiched between the
leaves of an old almanac. This, it is con
tended by Miss Austin, had been placed
there by Wileoxson as her legacy, but her
claim was rejected by the other heirs.
She brought suit for the recovery of $150,
--000 and the trial has been on for several
days. Both sides are making a strong
fight and there is said to be an excellent
prospect for some sensational disclosures.
One of the most important witnesses fot
Miss Austin to-day was Leonard Estes, a
rancher of Colusa County, He referred to
his fifteen years' acquaintance with Wil- i
eoxson and to the latter visit to Colusa
shortly before his death.
Said the witness: "One day Wileoxson I
made me come to him and said he was I
feeling bad. Ho said 'I am feeling very
bad and I want to talk to you.' He said
he had given everything he owned away
except one safe. I said. 'You can't take
that up above with you." He said. '1 am
going to give that safe to Amanda." He
said there was $170,000 in the safe, and
that Amanda was to give $20,000 of it to
nome old friends at his, and that she was
to keep the (150,000. He said that' the
money was in bills and was piled in an
old almanac
"He said that there was a letter lying
on top of the money addressed to Amanda
P. Austin, and this letter told Amanda
that the $20,000 was to be given away to
those designated in the letter, and that
the $150,000 was hers.
"I told him that maybe those who
opened the safe would destroy the letter
and Amanda would not get any of the
money, as there would be no evidence.
He replied: "Then- is no danger of that;
jmv nephew George will open the safe and
as* soon as he sees the letter addressed to
Amanda he will give it to her.' "
Miss Austin is seeking to establish her
claim that there was a letter in the safo
with the money which awarded it to her, !
but It will be contended on the other side
that there was no such letter. it is along
this line that the sensational testimony
is expected to come, although Miss Aus
tin is apparently contenting herself with
showing by the testimony of witnesses
that her uncle intended to leave her the
(150,000 found in the safe, and for which
no provision had been made In the will.
One of her witnesses. Rev. T. H. B. An. '
derson, has come from Missouri to testify,
while others have journeyed from dis- |
tances almost as remote.

How to Make Nervous People.
"America has become a land of ner-

our sins against the dietetic health
laws of nature.
"Only outdoor exercise ln a cold cli-
mate would enable vigorous Individuals
of our species to digest the viands
forced upon alimentary organs en-
feebled by sedentary occupations."'
writes Dr. Felix Oswald.
Brain workers must have different
food than day laborers, because brain
work uses up parts of the brain and
nerve centers, while physical labor
uses up other parts of the body. A
food for brain workers has been pre-
pared by scientific food makers and
called Grape-Nuts. It is a pure, nat-
ural food made from selected parts of
field grains known to contain the nat-
ural phosphate of potash and other
elements used by the system in re-
building and repairing the brain and
nerve centers. This food is skillfully
cooked at the factory, and is ready to
be served instantly either cold with
cream or as a hot breakfast dish
with hot milk or cream poured over it.
All first-class grocers sell Grape-Nuts,
and the Postum Co., at Battle Creek,
Mich., manufacture the food.

GALLERY GOD
DOWNCAST AT
- THE ALCAZAR
THE gallery god has left the Alcazar
this week a bit downcast. For the
Alcazar company has played "Jim
the Penman" and they have played
it with understanding.
The gallery god munched lemon drops \
hopefully through the first act md j
looked for better times. But they were j
not forthcoming. There was only one
good sound husband-and-wife sentiment J
which wound up with the proper halt i
for applause. The play was bo still that
It puzzled him. When the curtain fell j
he did not disturb It.
Meanwhile the old. breathless story j
was being told on the little stage by peo- j
ple who fitted into it as if it were a |
glove without wrinkle or pinch from j
thumb to little finger.
The honors of the evening belong to
the company. It Is the smoothness of
the play as a whole, the cast as a whole, j
that chiefly impresses one. The nearest ;
approach to starring was by Charles
King, as Jim.
The Alcazar is always a snugly little j
place. From the minute that you drop
your ticket you feel as much at home as !
at a strawberry festival, and It is all j
so very much more entertaining than a 1
festival. So long as Dan Halifax's frolics I
set off Helen Henry's pussyness the cozy ;
feeling is bound to last-
Nance O'Neil opens her last week at i
the California to-night in "Magda" and
the bill will last until Friday. Then
comes "School for Scandal." The for
mer promises much: the latter is still a
matter of speculation.
The Columbia announces that Eddie
Foy and his friends -will put up one week
more at "Hotel Topsy Turvy." "A Milk |
"White Flag" opens the 22d.
"The Masked Ball" will be produced at i
the Alcazar. Eugene Ormonde will have |
a chance to show what he can do ln John
Drew's part. Not a bad idea, although
it is hard to Imagine Gertrude Foster as j
a second Maud Adams.
Tillie Salinger has returned to the Tiv
oli and will appear In "Fra Diavolo" on
Monday iilght. The grand opera for the
week consists of "Othello" and "Caval
leria" and "Pagllacci."
At the Grand "Nation" will be sung.
The New Comedy Theater opens with
"Hans Hukebein." The Orpheum's new
turns are a monologist, a ventriloquist

SAX JOSE, Oct. 14.â The Farmers' Club,
Grange and Board of Trade are making
extensive arrangements for the entertain
ment of delegates to the State Horticul
tural Association that will meet in this
city from December 5 to 8 inclusive. The
fruit growers and vineyaxdists are par
ticularly interested. There will be musi
cal and literary entertainments, besides
excursions to various parts of the county.
Lick Observatory will also be visited, and
Stanford University is preparing to re
ceive the visitors. An attempt will be
made to have the time of the convention
changed so as to meet during the week of
the Golden Jubilee celebration of the
fiftieth anniversary of Statehood, which
commences December 20. The following
'â¢"-nmitt&e has charge of arrangements:
Judge J. R. Lewis (chairman), A. Bar

Brainard, T. A. Graham, Mrs. H. A.
Brainard. Mrs. J. R. Lewis, E. T. Pettitt.
Professor Emory E. Smith, A. Green
inger and E. M. Erhhom.
Many interesting papers will be read at
the convention by professors from Berke

turists.
BARBED-WIRE TELEPHONE.
Sunset Company Wishes to Connect
With the System.
STOCKTON, Oct. 14.â The barbed-wire
telephone system around La Grande and
Merced has proven such a success and
-rives promise of so much -rrowth that the
builders have received an offer from the
Sunset Telephone and Telegraph Company
looking to a mutual business arrange
ment. The Sierra Company has a barbed
wire system all over Merced and Mariposa
counties, while the La Grande company
has an extensive patronage in this county.
The Sunset company cannot connect with
any line which does not use Bell boxes;
these would cost about Jl 50 each. The
barbed-wire people do not believe that it
would pay to make any changes, and pro
pose to go on their independent way, re
joicing in the convenience of the present j
arrangement.
FEAR THE COMBINE.
Cattlemen of Texas Feel Somewhat
Uneasy.
AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 14.â The news that
has just reached here from New York
City that the gigantic cattle combine is to
be incorporated in a few days under the
name of the Consolidated Cattle Company,
with a capital stock of $100,000,000, has cre
ated a stir among the cattlemen of Texas.
Many small ranchmen claim that the big
syndicate will control the cattle industry
of the State to such an extent as to seri
ously injure their interests.
The new Texas anti-trust law goes Into
effect on January 31, 1900, and should the
cattle combine seek to influence prices of
livestock It will come within the pale of j
that drastic measure and legal steps will
be taken against It by the Attorney Gen
eral.

I Scientists have decided to construct a
I stone church edifice on the lot recently
I purchased by them at the northwest cor
j ncr of Franklin and Seventeenth streets
In this city, and it will be the first church
built on the Pacific Coast by a Christian
Science congregation.
The building committee, consisting of
Mrs. A. J. Ralston. Mr. and Mrs. W. E.
Hale, Mrs. Annie Crabtree, Charles A.
Ingerson, W. G. Spence and Dr. F. J.
Fluno, the pastor, met last evening and
selected Mr. Schultz of San Francisco as
the architect for the proposed building.
The society paid $8000 for its lot and has
$4000 now in bank, and it was voted that
the members proceed immediately to
raise â  $20,000. The society here has 200
members, and the proposed new edifice
will be of a size to seat 700 to 1000 per
sons. It will be of Gothic style of ar
chitecture, and besides the main au
ditorium there will be a Sunday-school
room. The cost will reach close to
$30,000. â  7-7-*y

THE DAILY RABID
I, close imitator of that style
of newspaper called in England "The Penny
Dreadful."
We recently published the full text of an official
rej>"it made t<> the War Department on conditions
in authorized agent of this
â¢. importance of the report was its
All oi the statements of fact in
it have been in the air or months. They have been
â 1 by coi lents in this country and in
The A-soeiated Press has taken cognizance
of many of them, and many others have been given
cut in interviews. They were not new, but their offi
â ::ent and authoritative verification was
â¢'1 was news, and The Call published it. The
â¢ Mes some, of the statements in
. column with an interview which it pub
with Rev. Mr. McQueen of Boston. We
could also parallel parts of it with interviews The
Call has published with General Reeve and others
who in the Philippines were observers of the same
incidents and had knowledge of the same facts as
appear in the official narration.
The Examiner's intimate knowledge of Rev. Mr.
McQueen, a Congregational clergyman, was shown
in its representation of him robed as a Catholic
priest confessing dying soldiers of that faith on the
battle-field and administering the final consolations
of the church according to the Latin rites!
The Call has no need to fake news, for it pub
lishes all the news. The Examiner system of pub
lishing only such news as it likes compels it to so
phisticate and invent and fake to fill the place of
what it suppresses.
In these high times, when news centers are dotted
thickly over two hemispheres, a genuine newspaper
has no lack of matter which interests all classes oi
readers. The Call is such a paper and has the enter
prise and facilities to maintain that character.
A CHARGE AGAINST DAVIS.
ONE of Phelan's weekly organs attacks Hon.
Horace Davis and charges that he teaches "a
Bible class." Whether Mr. Davis chooses- to
go fishing Sundays or teach a Bible class is his per
sonal affair. The Call wishes to say, however, that
while it feels no spirit of censorship of the religious
or the non-religious, there are many worse ways in
which a gentleman may spend Sunday than in teach
ing a Bible class. The Phelan push may see something
very wrong or very* amusing in it, and the Mayor's
chances may be advanced by sneering at it, but we
have never known any harm to society to come from
the intelligent, reverent instruction of others in the
great moral and ethical precepts of the Bible. States
men, long chastened and instructed by public life
and by bearing the great burden represented by the
welfare and fate of millions of people, have uniformly
testified that civil government among men is freer
of error, 'and society is less the victim of misery,
when and where the moral guidance of the Bible is
most generally accepted. This was the view of Glad
stone, of Bismarck and Thiers, and even was the tes
timony of Bonaparte in his fatal exile on St. Helena.
In this view even agnostic philosophers concur. Yet
the Phelan push seem to think that a gentleman who
teaches a Bible class and thereby is disseminating
moralities so useful in civil government as well as in
personal conduct is thereby disqualified for the office
of Mayor of San Francisco!
To be a Christian gentleman without being a sec
tarian bigot is to have a character desirable in public
office, and the enemies of Mr. Davis admit that such
is his character, but the "push" treat it as a disquali
fication!
It is worthy of note that with the dogs of war
howling in South Africa and the Philippines and
yelping in several South American republics no one
has heard a Peruvian bark. "
If we are to have a commercial museum in San
Francisco we ought to get it started before the ex
port exposition in Philadelphia ends and all the ex
hibits there are scattered.
THE CALL'S HOME STUDY.
OUR "Home Study Circle has been generally
and widely approved by the most eminent
educators. It is legitimate newspaper enter
prise, and is for the assistance not only of those
who are able to be students in school and univer
sity but for those who are not in the enjoyment of
such advantages, and for others who have passed the
school years but feel the need of more training and
prefer to give to it their leisure hours rather than
devote them entirely to flash reading. This is an age
in which the trained mind has the advantage. That,
indeed, has always been true, but time was that the
opportunity for training was within reach of the few,
and these, therefore, had an advantage over the
many. The opportunity for training has now be
come more general and is enjoyed by a vast majority
of the people of this country, and none are barred
except by circumstances for which our educational
system is not responsible. But in the development
of that system lias arisen a condition that somewhat
limits personal attention to individual students, who
need something- more than the day's class instruc
tion-and such direction as they find in a textbook.
Where conditions of fortune permit these resort to
private tutors to fill the gaps left in instruction in
class. This is frequently impossible, however, and
therefore there remain weak places in training that
leave the mind only partially equipped for the think
ing and application of knowledge which will be re
quired in the practical contacts of active life. The
great popularity of the Chautauqua circles, of the
various summer schools and university extension
courses, arises in the need felt for the strengthening
of these weak places left by the necessities of class
instruction.
The Call's course of study, prepared by the most
eminent educators in each line to be followed, is in
the same direction. In it everybody, from the ap
prentice boy and work girl to the busy professional
and business man and lady in society, will find
means of self-culture of the highest value, and if the
course be followed with interest and industry it will
result in a fair academic training. Adult studentts
who choose to give to its pursuit a part of their
leisure will .find in it a most interesting mental equip
ment and enrichment in that material which will add
to their interest in the broader affairs of life and will
aid them in restoring the learning and graces of con
versation which has been said to be an art lost in the
concentrations of our busy modern life. Its prime
value, however, is intended to be found in the help
given to the young. Mental training is like a chain,
no stronger than its weakest link. Active men have
not failed to note the lack of success in the careers
of many graduates of our higher institutions of learn
ing. This is due to a break in the symmetry of the
training they have received. Some principle has not
been fully grasped, and its faint impression has faded
from the mind. Its faintness was perhaps recognized
by the student, who let it pass without effort to
deepen its effect. Such students will find in our
studies the equivalent of that personal attention which
was lacking from the teacher. Each of the scholars
engaged in its preparation is, in effect, a private
tutor to every one who makes use of the course.
Every family to which The Call goes, therefore, will
enjoy the happy advantage of having practically as
private tutors all of these distinguished and expe
rienced educator-.
In another view of it we get the very warm ap
proval of teachers in the public and private schools
cf all grades. These teachers have the same feeling
they would have if each one of the professors who
make up our course was with them in their class
rooms personally aiding in the instruction of their
-pupils. All of these teachers are hard worked, and
some of them are overworked in the emergency pre
sented by our crowded schools, and to them this
course of study comes as a distinct and valuable and
appreciated help with their classes. We are, then, in
a clear and distinct sense, introducing a valuable ad
dition to the teaching force of every school without
cost to the taxpayers or burden upon the school fund.
A public journal should add all that it can to the
proper enlightenment of the people and should in
crease the usefulness of the equipment the young
should have to fit them for their place in active life.
It should also aid those who have lacked by reason
of no opportunity or failure to improve advantages
that were enjoyed. In this way a newspaper is doing
its whole duty to the community which supports it,
and this is the desire and purpose of The Call.
J. T. Tomkins, a Chicago horseman, and William
Taylor, colored, got into an argument a few days
ago, during the course of which Tomkins observed,
in the words of the song, "I don't like a nigger, no
how." The colored man promptly jabbed the end
of his umbrella into the Chicagoan's eye, blinding
him. Hereafter, also in the words of a song, "All
coons will look alike" to Tomkins.
EFFECTS OF THE RAINS.
REPORTS from various parts of the State are
to the effect that the rains have been every
where regarded as a blessing and that little or
no damage has been done by them to any crop. As
a rule the early rains do more or less damage to
grapes and to hay, but this year the losses of that
kind are said to be comparatively insignificant.
The only point where there i* any grave fear of loss
is at Truckee, where the storm brought a snowfall
which continued for about three days, and as the
stock and herds are still in the mountains there is a
good deal of anxiety felt concerning them. From
localities other than those of the mountains the re
ports are nearly all reassuring. In Sacramento it is
said the damage to grapes in that section will be
slight. From Stockton it is reported that thus far
there has been no damage, though at first it was be
lieved the table grapes would suffer. Other varieties
of grapes have been gathered. The rain has not
hurt the hay, for as a rule it is either baled or under
cover or stacked and water shedded.
Much of the same kind of reports are received
from other localities where the showers have been
good. From Ehnira comes the statement: "Little
damage has been done by the storm as the dry feed
was about all gone. No green or dry fruit was in
jured to any great extent." San Bernardino reports
no loss and adds: "The orange groves will be
greatly benefited." Ventura has some fears of dam
age to beets still in the fields, but other crops arc
safe. Thus it goes throughout the State. A little
damage here and there, but nothing sufficiently
serious to counterbalance the general blessing of the
rain.
A notable feature of the storm is the amount of
snow which has fallen in the mountains along the
whole length of the State from north to south.
While Truckee reports a snowstorm almost con
tinuously for three days. Los Angeles reports the
mountains of that section to be mantled with about
six feet of snow. This gives promise for a good
rainy season all winter, for as long as the mountains
are covered with snow there will be a temperature
in the upper air sufficiently cold to precipitate what

ever moisture may blow across from the ocean and
cause it to fall in rain upon the valleys.
The prospect is in every respect gratifying. All
that we really need in this State is rain. If we get
this year a rainfall sufficient not only to make a
season's crop but to fill up the sources of supply
which were nearly exhausted by the long droughts of
the recent years, we can look forward with good as
surance of prosperity whatever may happen else
where. The big bubbles of stock speculations in
Wall street may break, but they will not injure us.

THE ODD FELLOWS' JUBILEE.
rOR fifty years the order of Odd Fellows has
been at work in California, and during the
coming week, in accordance with a custom that
has become something like an unwritten law in the
United States, it will celebrate the jubilee with a
grand conference and festival. The event will be
the chief feature of the week for San Francisco, and
possibly for California, and will serve to remind the
| community of the good work which that and other
benevolent and fraternal associations have done and
I are doing for the betterment of humanity.
The first lodge of Odd Fellows in California was
' established September 9, 1849. The jubilee was not
held on the anniversary of that date because the
I Grand Encampment of the order is to meet here next
Tuesday and it was thought best to hold the festival
at that time. The celebration, therefore, will be
marked by the ceremonies of the encampment as well
as by the special features prepared for the com
memoration of the jubilee itself.
Within the fifty years of its work in the State the
1 order has grown from small beginnings to be one of
j the most potent institutions of the commonwealth.
ilt has in its subordinate lodges upward of 33,000
j members. In the Rebekah lodges, to which ladies
as well as men are admitted, there are about 17,000
members, of whom about 8000 are ladies. The encamp
ment branch of the order numbers about 7000. It
will be seen that numerically the order is strong in
all its branches and that its growth has fully kept
pace with the increasing population of the State.
The benevolent work of the association during its
career in California shows an expenditure in the
half century of over $6,000,000. Most of it has been
done quietly within the lines of the order itself and
with the simple grace of true charity, so that it is
not fully known even to the members themselves,
I but that it has been widely helpful is not to be
I doubted. To some extent, however, the good work
j shines before men and is visible in the stately build
j ings of the Home for Aged Odd Fellows at Ther
malito and the Orphans' Home at Gilroy. It ii,
moreover, frequently manifest in the work done by
boards of relief in all the principal cities of the State
j and by the employment branch.
Fraternalism is one of the marked characteristics
lof our people. In no other State of the Union do
I the various fraternal orders flourish as in Califor-
I nia in proportion to the numbers of the population.
I Among these orders the Odd Fellows have held a
high rank. Beginning in the State in the pioneer
! days, when almost every man in the community was
a stranger to every other, it set about' the work of
binding the better elements of the population into a
true brotherhood devoted to the service of a genuine
humanity. The members of the order who have in
herited the work of their predecessors can draw from
the past splendid inspirations for the future, and the
celebration of the jubilee this week will be a
prophecy of the wider work and higher good that
are to be wrought in the future.

AN INTERNATIONAL FIASCO.
WHEN the dignitaries who represented the
various powers at the great Peace Conference
at The Hague finished their discussions and
their dining, and with mutual good wishes bade one
another farewell, they returned each to his own home
and reported progress. As the Czar had requested
the conference, his Ministers felt it incumbent upon
them to speak for the conference as a whole, and in
a notable state paper they informed his imperial
Majesty that all was well, that the discussion had ac
complished much good, and that peace, if not within
reach, was at least in sight.-
Since that time, so short a while ago, President
Kruger of the Transvaal Republic has invoked the
powers to uphold the principles of arbitration agreed
upon at The Hague and to arbitrate the dispute be
tween the republic and Great Britain. Aguinaldo,
president of the Filipinos, has also invoked arbitral
tion in the interests of peace in the Philippines. To
each of these requests the high powers who babbled
of arbitration and universal peace so eloquently at
The Hague have turned deaf ears. Arbitration is a
good thing for diplomats to discuss over the wal
nuts and the wine after sumptuous dinners, but
clearly they still hold it would be a breach of eti
quette to suggest it as a practical reform to either
one of the powers.
There is something ominous in the fact that war
in the Transvaal followed so swiftly after The Hague
conference. It is a significant reminder of the old
saying, "Men cry peace, peace, when there is no
peace." Perhaps if another conference of the kind
should be held there would be universal war, one in
which the Czar himself would take part and go to
slaughtering as gayly as any conqueror known to
history.
When the Peace Conference was called no powers
hailed it with more alacrity than the United States
and Great Britain. The affair promised a good op
portunity for them to deliver moral lectures to the
nations of Europe which are cursed with militarism.
The warlike spirit of the Kaiser- and the thirst for re
venge and military glory of the French were to be
rebuked by the peace-loving, peaceful Anglo-Saxon
race of America and England. It was a beautiful
opportunity and it was fully taken advantage of.
Many were the sermons and many were the orations
pronounced in this country and in Great Britain
against the criminal folly of the military nations.
To-day the nations of Europe are all at home with
their armies holding spectacular parades and exer
cising their soldiers in harmless maneuvers, but we
and our cousins the British are making the brown
man and the Boer understand that soldiers are not
for ornament only.* The example we set will preach
louder than the words we uttered so fluently while
the conference was in session. We have, in fact,
turned the conference into a fiasco and started wars
which, while small in themselves, may have conse
quences which will involve the world in alarms and
set every nation on the globe to fighting.' ; lJ " ~

Now that the talking between the Boer
and the Briton has ceased and shooting
has begun, the fervor of American sym
pathy with the little fellow in the fight
has reached the singing point and poetry
pours forth from every quarter of the
country exhorting the Afrikanders to be
valiant and sweep the Anglo-Saxon from
the land. All of this poetry is worse
than wasted. . The Boers have songs of
their own. For the benefit of those who
like to express their sympathy by sing
ing it may be worth while to state that
a specimen verse of the national hymn
of the Transvaal runs thus:
\Vaai l-.oog nou in ons hplder lug,
Transvaalse vrijheldsvlag,
Oris vljande Is weggevlug;
Nou bllnk'n blijer dag.
I know not the tune of it, but that
Is a minor matter. The words are the
main thing and these sound warlike
enough to carry fear to the ears and pos
sibly to the hearts of foes, no matter in
what rhythm they be chanted or what
melody sung. Doubtless they will strike
as much terror into the British as fell
upon the Filipino when for the first time
he heard an American regiment shaking
the air of the tropic evening with a
grand chorus of that chivalric battle
song, "A Hot Time in the Old Town To-

The best outcome of the racket in the
Transvaal thus far has been the reawak
ening of Algernon Swinburne from his
long intellectual slumber. It Is true the
sonnet he sent forth on. awakening is of
no value as a contribution to literature,
to history or the news of the day, for it
was hoarse and uneven as If the singer
had a frog in his throat, and wild and in
coherent as if he were singing under the
influence of a nightmare. Such defects,
however, are due probably to the fact
that the poet was not fully awake when
he uttered his song. Better things are
to be expected of him and will surely
come if the war rouse him to mental ac
tivity again. The educated world, sati
ated with Kipling's barrack room style
of rhyme, is beginning to long for some
thing of genuine literary elegance, and
Swinburne is the only man in England
who can furnish it in the form of poetry.
If Oom Paul bring him from retirement
and sets k'.m to work again the old Boer
will have conferred some benefit on liter
ature, whatever damage he may do in
other ways.

It is said there are among the Brit

At any rate there is a fellow over there
with brains enough to write and money
enough to have his book published who
has set about inciting poets of this coun
try to strike their lyres and make a
noise Incessantly. In an "Ode to Amer
ica" he declares:
Thy lyric Muse,
Haunted by songs of either Ocean's waves.
Shall dip her pinions in celestial hues.
And strike the note of a new Foesy in minstrels
yet unborn.
And sing the twilight solitude
Of many an old primeval wood,
And celebrate the dawn of Freedom's ampler
morn.
The dithyrambic eloquence of that apos
trophe sounds like praise, but was doubt
less intended to Incite domestic disturb
ance? It is hardly complimentary, for ex
ample, to say our lyric muse is to dip her
pinions in celestial hues, seeing that such
hues are generally blueâ deeply, darkly
blue. The only redeeming feature of It all
is the intimation that the muse will strike
her new poesy in minstrels who are as yet
unborn. There is something of hope in
that. Perhaps minstrels now born will
keep quiet.

It Is time the outpouring of replies,
whether in prose or in verse, to "The Man
With the Hoe" should be stopped by lynch
law if necessary, for the limit has been
reached, and sent to me, moreover, with a
request for comment. It is too long to be
quoted in full; two stanzas will suffice,
and here they are:
When thou, liege host to hungry men, thy hoe
In scorn forsake,
Of whose green corn shall Markham, pray, In
scorn partake?
Lord almoner to queen, to maid of plaided
yoke.
Sun, Rain and God thy partners grand at every
stroke,
Ist more, or less, than kin to Balaam's friend
who mocks
Of thee, "to rapture dead, a brother to the
ox?"
'. Thou heart of hard work, we bow to thy hoe.
We thousand Vales, that mother fond, the
fruiting vine.
We thousand Plains, where million reapers
garner grain.
We thousand Hills, that graze, and green 'fore
God do nod-
Protest we allâ we live not sen-ants to a clod!
Likewise, we million meadowed Homes, half
like to heav'n,
Confirm our fatherman of earth the hope, the
leav'n.
Ye scribes of embroil, beware of his hoe.

be deferentially but firmly refused. This

There exist in the East certain associa
tions known as "mothers' clubs." and they
have been writing articles of vehement
controversy on the subject of Mother
Goose. According to one of our exchanges
these clubs in no less than four leading
States have made a movement to abolish
her melodies and jingles on the ground
that they are foolish, or, as the mothers
express it, "are vulgar, senseless jangle."
One mother is particularly severe on the
rhyme that tells how the cow jumped over
the moon; and says:
. "All the child knows of animal life is
what you are teaching him, and if he gets
false ideas it Is because you have given
him a wrong perspective, which his baby
mind absorbs and which he has to un
| tangle and learn later on. Why not give
I him a rhyme that is true?"
It would be a pertinent enough answer
to such a question to say that the rhymes
I of Mother Goose are just about as true
as any other rhyme except the one begin
ning "Thirty days hath September"; but
that would raise too wide an Issue to be
1 undertaken for casual readers. I refer to
the subject only to make it serve as an oc
casion for commending the sagacity of a
wealthy and benevolent lady in this city
who, having been requested to contribute
to a sum for the Home for Feeble-Minded
Children, replied with promptness: '"I

At a church fair which was one of the
brilliant events of Haywards last week
there were five boothsâ St. Mary's booth
St. Madeline's booth, St. Anthony's booth'
All Saints' booth and Dewey booth. So
Dewey has got in among the saints.
That 13 fairly good for California; but
here Is an incident which is better and
which the Boston Pilot says occurred In
that city: A few Sundays ago an exhorter
who was addressing a crowd on the com
mon solemnly and Impressively presented
to them the alternative of "salvation or
damnationâ the : King James ; Bible or the
Douay Bible!" To the preacher's discom
flture, his hearers instantly raised a shout
of "Hooray for the Dewey Bible!"
The Bostonians are not wholly ridic
ulous because they thought a Dewey
Bible had been put on the market. Such
a vast multitude of articles bear the name
of the admiral, it would be nothing sur
prising to hear of a novelty in theology
labeled in that way. In fact, what isn't
Dewey isn't fresh. Here's a New York
story by way of illustration: During the
reception festival an enterprising Bowery
photographer hung out in front of his
"studio" this fetching legend:
;
: HAVE YOUR PICTURE TAKEN :
: SHAKING HANDS WITH AD- :
: MIR AT. DEWEYâ I2 FOR 25c. :
Those who went into the gallery found
there a man with a false mustache and a
gray wig, who was made up to imper
sonate the admiral during the photo
graphing process. The photographer made
barrels of money.

Several of the New York papers have
been calculating to what an amount that
city is glad Dewey came home by way of
that port Instead of San Francisco. The
Sun estimates the number of outsiders
who visited the city at about a million
and calculates they expended an average
of $5 each, leaving the city $5,000,000
richer for the celebration. Of course all
that was not profit. The Herald, with
out attempting to determine exactly how
much the city made out of the reception,
estimates there was a total expenditure of
$20,000,000, which it distributes in this way:
For railroad tickets to New York $5,000,000
For fares on surface and elevated rail
roads 250,000
For hotels, restaurants and boarding
houses and seats for naval and land
parades 8,000,000
For decorations 1,000,000
For baggage express 500,000
For providing accommodations and
transportation for city and State
guests and for covering special public
decorations 273,000
For merchandise, souvenirs, etc.... 5,000,000
If the estimate of the Herald be correct
there is a coincidence of figures worth
noting. We paid Spain $20,000,000 for tho
Philippines and now we expend an equal
amount to welcome Dewey home. Let us
hope the rest of our imperial career will
be cheaper. We ought to conquer Agui
naldo for half what we paid for him, and
the welcome home of Otis ought to be put
at less than half the Dewey price.
Now that the high court of interna
tional arbitration has decided the dis
pute between Great Britain and
Venezuela there should be another
court of arbitration to review the
work and inform a perplexed world which
party to the controversy got the stakes,
since it seems conceded neither of them
won the game.
According to one set of reasoners the
award is in favor of Venezuela because it
confers upon that republic the control of
the Orinoco. According to another set
the lion's share goes to the British, for
although the Venezuelans get the river
they receive with it only a tract of worth
less swamp, while the British get a vast
area of the richest and best land In South
America. Some people think the United
States is a clear winner because we forced
John Bull to arbitrate, but there are other
folks who say we are losers inasmuch as
Uncle Sam claimed under the Monroe
doctrine the right to determine all Amer
ican questions without interference on the
part of Europe, while in this case Europe
did interfere and fix boundaries without
giving us anything more than a casual
hearing before the court. 77- â

Abused Work Horses.
Officers McCurrle and Hooper of the So

Animals made a raid yesterday on the
grading camp of the City Street Improve

Thomas Blanchfleld for cruelty to ani
mals. The company Is grading streets
and lots on Nineteenth avenue and J
Etreet, south of Golden Gate Park, and
complaint was made that a large number
of the horses us-ed were unfit for names*.
When the officers appeared two of the
drivers fled over the hills and could not
be caught. An examination of th>i live
stock snowed that none were in any too
good condition and half a dozen were
covered with harness sores. One horse
was so weak that it was unable to tin any
work, and had to be dragged by the re
mainder of the team.

found in the coalbin he had chopped a
large hole in the screen on the outer door,
unlocked the catch and, smashing the
glass in the second door, made his way
in by putting his hand through the aper

the door leading to the dining-room and
other apartments securely bolted. He
confined his operations to a room off the
kitchen, which contained the entire ward

After piling all the clothes in a heap

of the milkman stopped his operations.

DRIED FRUIT CROP

ginning of the First .
Rain.
The State's dried fruit crop, worth ap.
proximately *15,000,000, has been very lit
tie damaged by the rain. Advices have :
been received by the large commission
houses in this city, doing business with
the farmers, that such is the fact. Tho
estimate of the value of the crop was I
made for The Call some days ago by D.
H. Porter of Porter Brothers. Yesterday i
Mr. Porter said that the rain had not I
given him any reason to change his esti
mate.
"The first raisin crop," he said, "has
| been nearly all housed, and the loss on
i the second crop will be small. Perhaps
j the rain will teach the raisin-growers
â¢ that they would do better to send tho sec
ond crop to the wineries hereafter."
The conditions have been particularly
favorable this season for the drvlng of
fruit. The first rain came late and the
temperature has been about right for
drying for some time previous to the rain.
Last year the rains began in the middle
'â¢â¢ September and continued throughout
October. When the recent rain began the
fruit-growers received twelve hours* no
; tice from Mr. McAdie of the Weather Bu
: reau, and so had abundant time to get
their fruit under cover. Mr. Porter says
that the market will he all cleaned up
and will be in readiness for an enormous
crop next year, and the first rain will do
i the trees much good.

NEARLY FELL A
PREY TO A BIG
MOUNTAIN LION
Hunters Just Escape
With Life.
Two well-known huntersâ Captain Phil â 
T. Browne and T. B. Parkerâ home
from a two weeks' excursion into the ;
San Benito Mountains. During their trip
Captain Browne nearly lost the number :
of his mess during an encounter with a
mountain lion, while Parker discovered j
that a wildcat is not an animal to be .
despised when one is alone and unarmed. '
Captain Browne is superintendent of I
the State Board of Harbor Commission
ers' tugs and dredgers and Parker is
also in the tame employ. For weeks they
talked about this particular hunting trip j
and their friends were led to believe that !
venison and quail would be plentiful in
the Mission if they went shooting. On the
first of the month the two hunters, ac
companied by their wives, started by rail j
for Tres Pinos. There they were met by i
a couple of teams and were taken half
a day's journey into the mountains,
where they became the guests of F. Raj
moni. The other members of the party j
were J. Perano, L. Perano, Miss G. Ra- |
moni and Miss A. Barceloni. All the la
dies are good shots with the rifle, Miss
Barceloni particularly so, as Mr. Parser
will testify.
The entire party had been out picnick
ing and after lunch Parker went away tor
a stroll. Turning a corner he came face
to face with a wildcat. The animal was
in the shade of a big rock and, arching
its back, made ready to attack. Parker ;
had no weapon with him and he at once
turned and ran and the cat pursued h'm. !
' As he came into sight the party at lunch \
I did not at first know what was "doing." ;
i Miss Barceloni was the first to realize j
1 the situation and quietly dropping her i
sandwich she picked up her rifle and the
next instant the wildcat was dead with |
a bullet between its eyes. Half a dozen
j more of the animals were killed during
the trip, but Parker could not get over
| his dislike for the species and has rot
I done so yet.
Besides the wildcats the party got three
! deer, two mountain lions and one bear.
: The bear gave up the ghost on the first
: shot, but one of the mountain lions came
1 near to being the undoing of Cap
i tain Browne and Mr. Ramoni. The ani-
I mal was found on the side of the moun-
I tain and Ramoni's shot only wounded it.
The infuriated animal sprag on him and
the two relied down the hill together,
fighting as they went. Browne lost no ,
i time in following his friend down tne |
[ hill. In his hurry he lost his footing and ;
i a few seconds after the lion and Ramoni â 
j had reached the bottom of the hill ;
Browne landed on top of them. It did j
; not take him long to get his knife out I
' and as Ramoni was already at work with j
his "stick- the lion was soon dis- 1
: patched. Ramoni got a number of ugly
scratches from the brute and Browne has i
a long scar on his thigh that will re- '
; mind him or his fight with a mountain '.
] lion as long as he lives.
The party got plenty of quail and doves,
â  but in the eyes of the men they don't
, "count" with the big game. Captain
Browne says he never had such a delight- j
; ful outing and that he enjoyed his fight
: with the mountain lion as much as he did j
I any of the fights in the days of the re- '
bellion.
Wees of Rev. Marshall Law.
OAKLAND. Oct. 14.â The troubles of!
Rev. Marshall Law have ended. He has
sent in the resignation which he so often j
asserted v. ith much vehemence would !
never be given the trustees. The resigna- '
tion is very formal and Is in accordance j
with the terms of the agreement entered
into three months ago between the Bishop
the rector and the trustees. Dr. Law is
now in New York and will not return to
Oakland. According to the agreement by
which he was given three months' pay
he should resign before October 31. He
has done so a couple of weeks ahead of
time. %

SAYS HE WAS ROBBED.
William M. Hammond, a Discharged
Soldier, Wants Three Colored
Soldiers Arrested.
William M. Hammond, a discharged sol
dier, applied to Judge Mogan yesterday
for a warrant for the arrest of three
colored soldiers at the Presidio on a
charge of robbery.
He alleged that he met the J three sol-
diers in a saloon on Kearny street Friday
night and had several drinks with them.
They took him to a vacant lot somewhere
and after knocking him down robbed him
of $50.
Policeman Peters accompanied Ham
mond, who was still under the influence
of liquor, and told the Judge that there
were witnesses to the robbery. The Judge
refused to issue the warrant on such a
serious charge on the uncorroborated
statement of a drunken man and told
Peters to bring the witnesses Monday and
if they corroborated Hammond's state
ment he would issue the warrant.
Kissing may be unhealthy, but noth
ing risked, nothing gained.

ANOTHER WAR
OF ATHLETES
THREATENED
Pacific Association May Expel
University Men for Neglect
ing; to Pay Fees.
The regular monthly meeting of the
board of managers of the Pacific Associa
tion, Amateur Athletic Union, was held on
Friday night. President J. R. Bookman
In the chair. The president made a state
ment with reference to the money realized
at a track and field day given under the
auspices of the Pacific Association in 1896,
the purpose of which was to raise a fund
to pay the expenses of sending a team of
athletes of the University of California to
compete with some of the Eastern col
leges and universities. About $600 was
realised by the field day. As the team
was not sent to the East the money was
deposited lri the hands of Colonel Ed
wards of the University or California. At
the time It was decided that if no uni
versity team were sent from California
within a period of three years the money
should be divided between the university
and the association. The three years ex
pired last May. The delegates or the uni
versity and the managers of the associa
tion will lay the matter before Colonel
Edwards and request him to disburse the
money according to the arrangement
made.
F. I* Berry, representative of Stanford
University, and I. J. Muma, delegate from
the University of California, were elected
members of the board of managers of the
Pacific Association. The amendment pro
posed of S. J. Pembroke of the Alameda
Boating Club Increasing the length and
harrowing the beam of the outrigger skiff I
and permitting it to be built with a
smooth bottom was read and referred to
the regatta committee for consideration.
An amendment to the constitution and
by-laws of the association permitting
members of rowing clubs to compete ln
track and field events and track and field
athletes to compete in rowing races,
without regard to the rule requiring three
months to have elapsed since they last
competed, was proposed and read for the
first time. A committee was appointed
to draw up rules for handball. Indoor
baseball and basket-ball, sports over
which the association claims jurisdiction.
Secretary H. A. Keeler stated that the
amounts due by the universities of Cali
fornia and Stanford for sanctions for
football games played with teams from
clubs belonging to the association still re
mained unpaid, though repeated applica
tions for payment had been made. Sec
retary Keeler, who is also treasurer, de
tires that the universities be suspended
If payment be not made at an early day.
1". L. Berry and I. J. Muma promised to
bring the matter to the notice of the
athletic boards of the two universities
and endeavor to secure the payment of
the amounts due. After considerable dis
cussion It was decided that the two uni
versities and the Olympic Club be notified
to register nil their members who play
In scheduled football games after Octo
ber 14.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
DISCARDED.
The Old Methods of Treating Piles
and Rectal Diseases Supplanted
by the Pyramid Pile Cure.
The old methods of treating piles by
ligature, by the knife or by the cruel
methods of dilatation, besides causing In-
tense pain and frequently collapse and
death, are now known to be but mere
makeshifts as far as a cure is concerned.
The liver Is responsible for nearly every
case of piles, and the mistake has been
made of treating piles as a purely local
disease. Such Is not the case, however,
and the success of the new treatment
known as the Pyramid Pile Cure has
demonstrated It.
The Pyramid Pile Cure is not a salve
or ointment, but a suppository which Is
applied at night and absorbed into the'
sensitive local membrane and acts both
as a local and a constitutional treatment,
and ln cases of many years' standing this
treatment has been effectual.
Thousands of pile sufferers bear wit-
ness to the Inestimable value of the Pyr-
amid, and even those who have undergone
surgical operations without a cure have
been happily surprised by results from
a few weeks' treatment with the Pyra-
mid.
The relief from pain Is so Immediate
that patients sometimes Imagine that the
Pyramid contains opiates or cocaine be-
cause the relief is so Instantaneous, but
the Pyramid Pile Cure Is guaranteed ab-
solutely free from any opiate or mineral
poison whatever.
The relief is the result of the astringent
properties of the remedy, which causes
the little tumors and congested blood ves-
sels to contract and a normal circulation
is established. ,
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is strictly
scientific, both in its composition and in
Its therapeutic action, and the best fea-
ture of It Is tnat it is perfectly safe and
harmless. No ill effects ever result from
Its use, but only positive benefit.
A singular fact, in view of the large
number of patent medicines before the
public, is that the Pyramid is the only
Pile cure of national reputation. It Is the
only Pile cure popular enough and merit-
orious enough to be found in every drug-
store ln the United States. It sells at DO
cents for a full-sized package.

ORNAMENT IS
A WONDER AT
UNION PARK
Wins at 20 to \ as the Climax
of a Day's Sensational
Coursing.
The opening day's sport of the "Centen
nial," or one hundreth day's meeting at
Union Coursing Park, bordered on the
sensational from first to last. The hares
proved unusually strong, repeatedly tak
ing the dogs around the field and then
making good their escape. The going was
so fast that Judge Grace rode three
horses to a standstill, where one usually
i suffices.
The first four hares released ran for
nearly one minute each. Many hares out
footed the dogs and on other occasions a
third dog was released.
Murphy & Toland's Ornament furnished
the great surprise of the day. In the last
course he met Hawker, which was In
stalled favorite at once. The pool-sellers.
ln their efforts to promote wagering,
gradually lengthened the odds, until they
were offering $20 to $1 on Hawker. Three
tickets were written at these odds. Haw
ker led by several lengths and secured
the first turn. Ornament was then placed
and finally won a long drawn out course
by a score of 17 points to 6. Hawker was
practically held out of the long odds book
as being the ultimate winner. In the run
down Ornament met Rapid Addition, and
after traveling all over the field their
course resulted in an "undecided," each
scoring 17 points. They were allowed a
rest until after luncheon, when Ornament
won, scoring 12 to 4.
Merced, a 1 to 8 shot, proved a surprise
by defeating Aeneas by a score of 30 to a.
St. Michael, 1 to 2*4, beat Wlldwood; Un
cle Fuller beat Peg the Rake at the same
odds; Black Pattl, 1 to 2, beat October
Woodcock. Frosty Morn, a promish.g
dog from Australia, beat Black Chief at 3
to 5. but was beaten by Revolver ln the
next round.
Lavender, which Is a prime favorite
: with the spectators, beat the great Belle
Clair. The latter may be still suffering
from a four-minute bye with Daisy Clair
recently.
The Centennial stake, to be run to-day,
is of the highest possible class. There
Is hardly a notable absentee, and with
strong hares the sport should be exciting.
Music will be furnished throughout the
day by Yon der Mehden's band, the pro
gramme being made up chiefly of popular

THE SAN fEANCISCO CALL, SUN DAT, OCTOBER 15, 1899.
FOOTBALL
THAT ENDS
IN A TIE
Neither Olympics Nor Cali
fornias Score in Their Sec
ond Gridiron Contest.
Olympics 0, California* O.
Another tie for the Olympics and this
time with the Blue and Gold. The score
of the football game yesterday between
the athletic clubmen and the collegians
about tells the tale, for In every detail
of the game was there an equality. Cali
fornia was poor on the defensive when
the line should have been gummed with
mucilage. So was the Olympic team.
California was weak on the offensive
when the eleven should have battered
down the opposition in front. And the
Olympics duplicated this performance
when conditions were reversed.
For the first time since the season
THE CALL'S RACING CHART.
OAKLAND BACKTRACE:, Saturday, October 14, 1899.â Nineteenth
day of the Winter Meeting of the California Jockey Club. Weather
fine. Track heavy.
opened the weather was propitious for
football. A touch of north wind crisp
ness was over the field and made the
players work to keep warm. The men
were eager to mix things and in their
anxiety to play or perhaps steal a march
on their opponents committed any num
ber of off-side plays, keeping the officials
busy marking off ten-yard penalties.
Everybody who had hall" a chance fum
bled the pigskin, sometimes with damag
ing results. Occasionally a rare misjudg
ment would bristle the minds of the side- !
line experts and all these elements put |
together made a hodge-podge which was
entertainment and amusement for the
spectators.
In the beginning of the second half the
Olympics thought they were going to
score, Down the field they came, bang
ing and smashing Into the college line,
which was very unsticky. Within five
yards of the goal the advance was j
checked and the suddenly born hopes of j
the clubmen were dashed to earth. Just |
after this In most surprising fashion the |
California team turned the tide and
treated the Olympics to the same kind
of plugging medicine. They, too, were |
out short in their goal-making career |
about five yards from the scoring point.
The Olympics had but one chance at it :
and failed; California had two and did
the same thing In both cases.
When the university's eleven lined up i
a new set of backs were tried, but in ;
the second half the old quartet was In
the game. The Olympic's backs played
good ball, especially Dinsmore, whose \
dashes through the line and long runs
netted many gains for Olympia. Felton
Taylor played with his old-time vigor and
force.
Broughton kicked off for California and
the game was on. Three times the Olym
pics failed to advance and the ball was
punted back to California. A try through
the Olympic line and then a long punt by
Broughton gave the ball to the clubmen.
But as the gains were slow kicking was
again resorted to. The first half was a
series of punts, fair defensive work on
both sides forcing the fullbacks tÂ© swing
their feet at the pigskin on many occa
sions. Now and then a dash through the
line or a run around the end by
Broughton, Dinsmore or Taylor would
warm the hearts of the spectators and
provoke the leathern-throated shouts of
college men on the benches. Neither side
was in a fair way to score during this
half. The Olympics were satisfied with
themselves because California had not
earned a touchdown and California said
to itself with unctuous self-flattery, "Just
wait until our real backs are in the game."
The second half was Interesting ball,
though full of frothy streaks. After an
exchange of punts the Olympics began
working the ball down the field from the
very middle of the gridiron. Five yards
at a stroke came the line plungers, Taylor
and Dinsmore, and California could do
nothing but recede. Within a jump of the
goal some of the old spirit came Into the
California line, and then the Olympics
stopped short in their victorious rush.
The college men took the ball and punted
it out of danger.
Once again the ball was California's in
the center of the field, after being punted
out of danger by Dinsmore, ana once
again the ball began to move down the
Olympic territory. Seven yards from the
goal line Kaarsberg tried a drop kick, but
missed the goal. Whether it was fear
that the necessary distance to victory
could not be covered or miscalculation in
time left for play induced him to try this
feat is not known. At ahy rate, a chance
was lost and the game ended in a tie.
After this nothing more was done .which
could mean a touchdown for either side.

THERE WAS
BUT ONE IN
HANDICAP
Pat Morrissey Galloped Away
From His Field â Three
Choices Downed.
The card at Oakland yesterday looked
as if it might have been buffeted by tho
recent storm, but still it attracted the
usual Saturday throng and the betting
was of the liveliest description. Owners
of the better class of horses apparently
did not care to send their racing material
out in the sticky going, and in conse
quence the fields possessed little class.
Five events were down for decision, of
which number favorites captured but two.
The handicap over one mile and a fur
long, with a gross valuation of $500, was
the feature of the afternoon, and con
cluded the sport. Pat Morrissey was
asked to pick up 112 pounds and step off
a longer distance than he had ever before
traveled, and did it like rolling bowlders
down Telegraph Hill. As good as 7 to 10
in the ring, he galloped the entire route.
Judge Wofford, ridden by Johnson and
carrying 71 pounds in the saddle, backed
from 30 to 15 to 1, came along the last
part, taking the place from New Moon.

T. Walsh, on Rapldo, picked out the deep
going next the rail, and would have been
there yet had the race been a six-day one.
Eddie Jones piloted the long shot win
ner of the afternoon on The Buffoon.
The Fordham gelding was one of six
starters in the sprint over the Futurity
course, for which Ned Dennis ruled a 4 to
5 favorite. His odds drifted from 4 to 10
to 1, and he won all the way. Ned Dennis,
the favorite, chased him for a while and
then gave It up, losing the place to Rix
ford, another outsider.
Of the starters in the opening event, a
six furlong selling sprint, Charley
i Thorpe's mount, Lou Rey, a son of El
Rio Rey, was justly installed favorite.
Billy A created the usual scare In the
wheat pit by losing his field the first part,
but In the stretch developed the custom
ary attack of leg weariness. Picking the
dry spots on the outside, Thorpe landed
the first choice winner over The Offering
by three lengths. The latter might have
won under more careful pilotage. Master
Lee ran third.
Some wise scout In the employ of a book
must have circulated the report that In
dra liked muddy going, although it is a
fact that he is one of the get of Hindoo,
that does not. Anyway, the gouty old
black horse closed equal favorite in the
betting on the second race, also a six
furlong sprint, with Castake. Tough and
tried as a ferry-boat steak, he couldn't
raise a canter. Mounce's alarm clock on
Castake was slow in going off, but he did
wake up in time to finish a distant second
to Lavator, .the third choice, which won
walking. Rozalbra ran third.
Devin's Industrious efforts on Major
Cook to discover a new northwest passage
to the pole permitted McCloskey to land
Katie Gibbons first in the six furlong
spin, fourth on the bill of fare. McClos
key Is not an artistic but a persuasive
driver. He convinced Coburn, astride
Shellac, that he was mote noisy than
bright, and while Devln, on Major Cook,
was skirting along the suburbs in quest
of sun-dried spots Katie downed the
Major a length. High Hoe, on which
there was quite a pronounced play, fin
ished in the target-bearer's place.

QUEEN OF WOMEN GOLFERS.
Mi&3 Ruth Underbill Wins the Final
Game at Philadelphia.
PHILADELPHIA. Oct. Miss Ruth
Underhill of the Nassau Golf Club of
Glencove, L. 1., Is queen of the women
golfers of the United States. This after
noon on the links of the Philadelphia
County Club at Bala she defeated Mrs.
Caleb F. Fox of the Huntingdon Valley
County Club of Rydal, Pa., by a score of
two up, with one to play, thus becoming
the national champion. That she should
win against Mrs. Fox was a, surprise to
those who had watched the playing of
both of them during the tournament this
week. Mrs. Fox's playing had been of
the steadiest kind. She had the hardest
road to traVel in the qualifying rounds,
and defeated the three-time champion,
Miss Beatrix Host, on Thursday.
The golf played by Miss Underbill and
Mrs. Fox to-day was not of tho champion
ship kind, and both have played better
during the week. The greatest falling off
was that of Mrs. Fox. She topped innu
merable drives and Miss Underbill did not
do much better. Here and there they
made good drives, but as a whole their
work in this line was only fair. That
both were nervous could easily be seen
when they were on the green.
The final round in the consolation class
for the trophy offered by the Golf Asso
ciation of Philadelphia between Eunice
Terry of-Irvington, N. V.. and Mfss Lucy
Herron of Cincinnati was won by the lat
ter by one up.
Two Snowbound Hunters.
P. H. Bushnell, the photographer, and
Bookmaker Johnnie Coleman, who left
here three weeks ago on a hunting and
fishing trip, are snowbound somewhere
in the mountains back of "Weber Lake.
The party was to have returned last Mon
day night, but before they broke camp a
heavy snowstorm Bet in. Joe Epplnger,
the wheat broker, who accompanied them,
but who returned last week, states that
Bushnell and Coleman are encamped in
an Isolated canyon, and if the snowfall
is a heavy one it may be a month before
they can make their way to Truckee. As
they were amply supplied with provisions
no apprehension is felt for their welfare.

REDS WIN
HONORS AT
FOOTBALL
Carlisle Indians Defeat the
University of Pennsylvania
Eleven.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 14. -The Univer
sity of Pennsylvania football eleven was
defeated this afternoon by the Carlisle
Indians, by a score of IC to 5, on Franklin
field, in twenty-five minute halves. The
Indians won because they played the bet
ter football. There was no fluke or chance
about It, but a clean-cut victory. Nearly
15,000 persons saw the braves scalp the
"Quakers." The big crowd, helped by the
university band, time and again cheered
the white men to do something; but it
was not in them.
The enthusiasm of the Indians ln at
last conquering one of the "Big Four"
knew no bounds, and for a time they held
a. regular war dance.
Pennsylvania's greatest weakness to
day was in the line. The red men dis
covered this early in the game and went
through like a shot countless times.
Pennsylvania's hope In the center was
Overfleld.^but as he only recently recov
ered from a severe illness and this was his
first game of the year he could not fulfill
the hope reposed in him. The Quakers
were off color in their Interference.
.There was, In fact, almost a total absence
of It. Another weak point in Pennsyl
vania's game was the regularity with
which their men missed tackles. Several
Limes three and four men missed runners,
yy which the Indians gained many yards.
l>n the other hand, the Indians' tackling
was fierce and sure, they seldom missing
their man. There was not much fum-
Dling on either side. Little Hudson tried
â wo goals from the field, and succeeded
n dropping one. Captain Hare of Penn
sylvania dropped a difficult one from the
twenty-yard line. The red men's two
ouchdowns were made on a series of line
-lunges and end runs. Pennsylvania could
>nly hold them at times.
CHICAGO, Oct. 14.â For the first time
n the history of intercollegiate football
i strong Eastern eleven was to-day de
:lslvely defeated by a Western team.
Cornell University and the University of
Chicago elevens met on Marshall field,
Chicago winning by a score of 17 to 6.
?ull halves of thirty-five minutes were
)layed. This fact was in Chicago's favor,
he maroon players being evidently ln
*etter condition than their Eastern op
ponents, who weakened perceptibly
oward the close of the second half.
The result was a surprise even to Chi
â¢ago's strongest adherents, as the West
ern team was without Captain Kennedy,
vho was laid out in the Notre Dame
fame of two weeks ago. â¢ In but one re
spect did Cornell show superiority and
hat was in tackling. The Cornell backs
md ends seldom failed to nail their man
lard and sure.
The Chicago ends were more uncertain
and high in their tackling, but their
work was effecttive enough to prevent
any material gains from end runs, and
Cornell, in consequence, was often forced
to punt. Cornell scored her only touch
down in the first half by good hard line
bucking. In the line, where the Eastern
ers were expected . to show the greatest
superiority, Chicago did the better work,
and in the second half the Cornell men
were played off their feet, Staker tearing
through time and again for more than
the distance.
It was straight, hard football through
out, and so fierce that four of Cornell's
menâ Starbuck, Walbridge, Caldwell and
Payneâ were compelled to retire in the
second half. Few trick plays were at
tempted and only two were successful,
Staker making twenty-two yards on a de
layed pass and Henry fifteen yards on a
double pass. This latter play was tried
twice afterward by Chicago, but Right
end Cross nailed his man for a loss each
time.
Chicago outclassed Cornell in the quick
ness in which the ball was put into play
and also displayed more effective interfer
ence. The interference of Cornell, when
her backs attempted to swing around the
ends, was too compact, and for this rea
son was often put out of tne play alto
gether by the maroon ends and backs,
who tore It to nieces sometimes before
the ball was f.irly started.
The punting on both sides was decidedly
off color, particularly In the first half.
First Young, who did most of the kick
ing for Cornell, kicked the ball into his
own line and this ultimately resulted in
a touchdown for Chicago.

Taken to San Jose.
"Wong Hing, a Chinese laundryman, was
taken to San Jose yesterday by Deputy
Sheriff Bache, where he will have to an
swer for a charge of asault to murder.
He was tried In Judge Lawlor's court on
a charge of assault with a deadly weapon,
but the jury disagreed and he was at once
arrested on the San Jose charge. On
June 20, during a fight in Chinatown, San
Jose, Wong Hing fired a shot at Deputy
Sheriff Bache and wounded him.

THE parasitic germ is measured under the microscope
by the twenty-five thousandth part of an inch. Its
power is measured by the cholera scourge, the plague,
consumption, and other decimating diseases. ; The germ
lies in wait for human life on every side : in earth, air,
water and food. Attention has of late been drawn to pets
as disease disseminators. -Many a boy has taken diptheria
from his pet dog; many a girl owes consumption to her
canary.
In London, England, they are legislating to compel a
monthly examination of feathered pets, by the board of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1899.
HAS COME TO ADJUST
LABOR DIFFERENCES
SAMUEL B. DONNELLY, president of the International Typographi
cal Union, arrived here yesterday morning from Los Angeles ana
Is now at the California Hotel, which will be his headquarters dur
ing the week or ten days he will remain among us.
The object of Mr. Donnelly's visit to this city is to meet the
different local unions and to look into and attempt to adjust the differences
that now exist between the printers of this city and the organized forces of
the employers of the book and Job printing concerns.
When seen, yesterday at his hotel Mr. Donnelly said that as president of
the International Union he was Instructed at the meeting of that body last
August In Detroit to visit the Pacb.c Coast and confer with the different
local organizations for the purpose of looking after the state of the printing
trade and devising the best means of promoting the general welfare of both
employers and employed. â 
Owing to the geographical situation of the Pacific. Coast and the dis
tance which Intervenes between the local organizations here and the great
mass of union labor ln the East, the lpcal men may have thought they were
more or less isolated from i ctive participation ln the more lmportatnt
movements throughout the country. This impression Mr. Donnelly will do his
best to remove by showing the printers of San Francisco and other cities
in California that they are as well taken care of by the International Union
as their brethren who are nearer to the great trade centers.
At the last meeting of the Federation of Labor in Kansas City Oriental la
bor In Its bearing on expansion was discussed. While on the coast Mr. Donnelly
will look into the race problem and endeavor to find out what influence this
Oriental influx has had on the skilled white labor and to what extent the
workingmen of the Pacific Coast have been hurt by Chinese and Japanese
comp-titicn He will present the result of his researches to the American
Federation of Labor when that body meets in Detroit next December.
Mr Donnelly is being taken care of by the following committee, who
met him when he arrived yesterday, and are looking after his welfare while
he remains in this city: Harry Glbb, president of the local Typographical
Union ] T Houston? H. Jenner, C. E^ Hawkes J. K. Phillips, H. L.
White Francis Drake, Leo Michelson and Frank *\V andress.
This afternoon Mr. Donnelly will speak at the meeting of the Allied
Trades Union at 14 Third street.
home in Boston. He comes to the coast
on one of his regular pilgrimages and will
bold several meetings before he leaves.
Mr. Mills has always been a favorite
with the general public notwithstanding
the unfavorable opinion that different
ministers have seen fit to express from
time to time and there is no doubt that
his revivals will be as well attended this

Its future power for harm depends chiefly upon the
condition of the stomach and organs . of digestion and
nutrition. When food is perfectly digested and assimi-
lated, when the- blood is pure and abundant, disease
finds no foothold. Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery
makes the body practically impregnable against disease.
It heals diseases of the stomach and other organs of
digestion and nutrition. It increases the activity of the
blood-making glands and so increases the supply of pure
blood. It carries off the waste and poisonous accumu-
lations from the system. . It makes a strong, healthy*
body, built up of sound flesh instead of flabby fat.
Even when the lungs and respiratory organs have
been attacked, and there were obstinate cough, bron-
li, weakness and emaciation, "Golden
Medical Discovery" has restored the
sufferer to perfect and permanent
health. If you are sick begin to
use "Golden Medical Discovery" and
you will begin to be well.
There is no substitute for the " Dis-
covery" and nothing "just as good."
Any attempt to sell you any other
preparation in place of Dr. Pierces
medicine has only one object, the de-
sire of the dealer to make an exces-
sive profit
There is no alcohol in "Golden
Medical Discovery," and it contains
no cocaine, opium or other narcotic.
Persons suffering from chronic
forms of disease are invited to con-
sult Dr. Pierce by letter free. All
correspondence is strictly private and
sacredly confidential, and all replies to
correspondents are mailed in plain
envelopes bearing no advertising or
printing of any kind. â¢ Address Dr.

Mrs. Ella Schall, of Moosehead, Luzerne Co., Pa., writes: Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery cured me in one month, sound and well. You
remember my case was abscess of the breast. We had spent lots of money for
doctor bills, and I had. almost given up in despair, when I told my husband I
was going to write to you. lam very glad I did so; I had used your medicines
before with the best results."
Her Doctor was Wrong.
When I commenced taking your medicines, eighteen months ago, my health
was completely broken down," writes Mrs. Cora L. Sunderland, of Chaneyville,
Calvert Co., Md. WAt times I could not even walk across the room without
pains in my chest. The doctor who attended me said I had lung trouble and
that I would never be well again. At last I concluded to try Dr. Pierces medi-
cines. I bought a bottle of ' Golden Medical Discovery,' took it, and soon com-
menced to feel a little better, then you directed me to take both the ' Golden
Medical Discovery' and the 'Favorite Prescription,' which I did. lam now
almost entirely well, and do all my work without any pain whatever, and can
run with more ease than I could formerly walk."

patches, is that there was a clause in the
old contract which prevented the Nica
ragua Government from applying the time
limit for the expiration of the agreement
if causes beyond the control of the Mari
time Company, like civil disturbances,
should prevent the continuous prosecution
of the work. As a matter of fact there
have been such disturbances, and out
breaks have taken place both in Nicara
gua and Costa Rica by which interference
has been occasioned. The Nicaraguan
Government will not dispute that there is
such a clause. At the same time it is a
fact that the contract entered into with
the Cragin-Eyre people fixed a day when
the old contract should be considered to
have terminated. That date was Tuesday
of the past week.
In the Cragin-Eyre contract are the fol
lowing words in article V: "The State of
Nicaragua shall grant in perpetuity to
the Intcroceanic Company (organized un
der the Cragin-Eyre concession) the ex
clusive right to survey, locate, excavate,
construct, enlarge, extend, use, maintain,
own and operate a maritime canal and its
accessories between the Atlantic and Pa
cific oceans through the territory of Nica
ragua. As long as this agreement is in
force the State (of Nicaragua) covenants
not to njake any other contract for the
construction of a canal between the two
oceans."
The issue of fact is made up simply.
The Nicaraguan Government contracted
with Cragin-Eyre that the old contract
should terminate October 9. 1599. The old
contract provided that the time limit
should net be applied if domestic disturb
ance interfered with the progress of the
work under the old contract. Disturb
ances did take place; nevertheless the
Nicaraguan Government has applied tbe
time limit and another company to con
struct the canal has been authorized by
that Government.
The persons interested directly as in
vestors in the old project residing
in the United States are numerous.
They are in nearly every State in the
Union. San Francisco's share in the in
vestment was comparatively small, al
though it may represent a quarter of a
million In total. New York invested much
more. As far back as 1595 the actual ex
penditures of the old company in canal
construction were between $4,000, and
"â 5,000.000. Behind President Hitchcock,
therefore, will be powerful influences to
work with the Department of State, and
the entire matter may take on an inter
esting shape.

BROOKLYN, Oct. 14.â The season ended here
in a row to-day. In the second inning Shep
ard assaulted Umpire Hunt for calling him out
on a fluke and refused to retire from the game
when ordered to do so. Hunt appealed to Cap
tain Smith and Manager McGraw without ef
fect. He then appealed to Hanlon, who occu
pies the peculiar position of president of the
Baltimores and manager of the Brooklyns.
Hanlon told him he would support the umpire
in any action he might take, whereupon the
game was forfeited to Brooklyn. The score at
the time was 1 to 0 in Baltimore's favor.
A game postponed from Baltimore was then
played to appease the crowd. Brooklyn won
by batting Howell in timely fashion. The
Orioles tried to delay the game by throwing the
ball over the lot in the fourth inning, but
were foiled. The Brooklyns won the series, 8

FAMOUS GOLF EXPERT
FOR OAKLAND CLUBMEN
! The San Francisco Golf Club opened the
winter season yesterday with an eighteen
hole handicap, medal play. The course
was taken in the . opposite way to that
' hitherto pursued, the eighth hole becom
i ing the first, the seventh becoming No. 2,
and so on, the ninth hole being on tha
home green, as usual. By adopting this
order of play a strong element of novelty,
was introduced, the drives that were for
merly downhill becoming uphill, and vice
versa. The course Is said to be improved,
by being played in this way. A dozen,
players entered the competition and hand
ed in the following returns:
As shown by the above table, S. L. Ab
bot Jr. won the first prize and Charles
Page captured the second trophy. Had
the latter's second round equaled his first
his gross score would have brought him
out first, and his net score would have
been five below Mr. Abbot's total. R. G.

Golf Club, did not do himself justice with
a gross score of IT".

RAILROAD CANDIDATE
FOR A HIGH PLACE
Gen, N. P. Chipman for Inter
state Commerce Commissioner,
Petitions in His Behalf Circulated by
Herrin of the Southern Pacific,
GENERAL N. P. CHIPMAN, the Southern Pa
cific Company's Candidate for Interstate
Commerce Commissioner.
Câ . jâ 3 HERB is a vacant place in the
Interstate Commerce Commission,
caused by the resignation of Will
j^ lam J. Calhoun of Illinois, and the
sentiment in California is pro
nounced that President McKlnley should
fill the vacancy by the appointment of a
capable, independent and broad-minded
resident of the Pacific Coast. The States
and Territories west of the Missouri River
are not represented in the commission, al
though the South, New England, New
York and the Middle West have represen
tation. As a matter of fairness, from a
geographical point of view, the demands
of the Pacific Coast cannot be set aside.
Californians do not contend that the
President should appoint a citizen of this
State, but they do advance the contenUon
that one member of the commission
-should be a resident of this coast. Among
the prominent public men of Oregon an
acceptable commissioner may be found.
Washington may present a candidate of
exceptional fitness. California could pre
sent a man fitted in every sense to serve
on the commission. The Call suggests an
independent manâ meaning in that sug
festion that the commissioner should be
pee from railroad alliance and affiliation.
It has come to the knowledge of The
Call that the Southern Pacific Company
has a candidate for Commissioner. W. F.
Ilerrin Is causing petitions to be circulat
ed for signatures requesting the President
to appoint General is. P. Chipman of Red
Bluff. General Chipman is regarded as an
estimable gentleman, but he Is the candi
date of the Southern Pacific, and there
fore his appointment would produce wide
spread discontent if not outspoken indig
nation.
One of the main purposes for the crea
tion of the commission was to. secure to
every person just and equal treatment ln
all that pertains to public transportation.

It must be obvious, therefore, that a man
] closely allied to the powers that manage
i and control railway transportation ought
not to be selected for service on the Com
mission. The great body of consumers
and producers on the Pacific Coast, whose
Interests are so vitally affected by the
cost of transportation, could not be prop
erly served by General Chipman: Ho could
not maintain an independent and fearless
I attitude in the Commission. At all times
i he would be confronted with the fact that
the Southern Pacific influence had been
i enrolled to secure his appointment. Ho
j would be impelled by a sense of common
: gratitude to protect the interests of his
I benefactors.
Californians have learned by long and
bitter experience that State Railroad
Commissioners brought forward and sup
! ported by Southern Pacific agencies have
; been unfaithful to the interests of the
j people. In a measure the Interstate Com
i merce Commission bears the same rela
tion to the States that the State Commis
; sion bears to the counties.
The Commissioner to fill the Calhoun
I vacancy should represent the producers
I and consumersâ the people who pay the
| cost of transportation. If General Chip
man had all the business qualities of a
> first-class Commissioner the fact that the
1 Southern Pacific had selected him for
: special preference should be deemed suffi
! cient to exclude him from the list of the
; desirable.
A railroad candidate ought not to be
chosen. The Southern Pacific has an un
doubted right to produce a candidate. The
same right is enjoyed by the Santa Fe
and the Union Pacific, but the Senators
nnd Representatives in Congress from the
Pacific Coast should carefully study the
wishes of the people before they recom
mend any applicant to the President.
If the President desires to gratify the
People of the Pacific Coast he will not ap
point General Chipman. If he, desires to
please the Southern Pacific and offend the
people he will appoint General Chipman.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., SUNDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1899.
CONLON BURIED BILLS
TO ESCAPE EXPOSURE
Accused of Filing Many Claims for Unde
livered Goods.
School Board Demanded His Resignation, but Crimmins Saved
Him From Degradation and Armstrong
Implicated.
*7T Is due solely to the Intercession of
Philip Crlmmins that School Direc
tors Conlon and Gedge' have not
been deprived of their profitable posi
ci tlons on the Supplies and Building
and Grounds Committee of the Board of
Education. The same influence has been
exerted these past few weeks to save
them from inevitable disgrace and to pre
serve their commercial value as School
Directors, but to that end it has not
proved potent. Director Conlon stands
not only accused but convicted of
about every time-worn, crooked graft
that ever swelled the income of an
acquisitive member of the School
Department; and the lady-like Dr.
Gedge, who has sworn loudly and long
to his honesty, and found much difficulty
in proving it, is with him. Director Arm
strong, chairman of the Buildings and
Grounds Committee, is running not over a
length behind, although the Finance
Committee of the board has not yet com
pleted its investigation of his otiicial ca
reer. . i '
It Is due to this same Investigation by
the Finance Committee, and the evident
anxiety of that body to keep the truth it
discovered from the public, that every
fact and phase of the charges which The
Call made against Conlon and Gedge have
been given to the public. For a month
past the committee has been rigidly in
specting every account of the two com
mittees, but fearing that it might suffer
by association, by a revelation of the
facts, has, from time to time reported
that all was well. Not until the last
meeting, wnen it deprived Conlon, Arm
strong and Gedge of all power in their
respective committees, was there an ink
ling to be had of the things that were
under the surface.
The first irregularity which came under
the notice of Chairman Harry Holbrook of
the Finance Committee was that Conlon
! and Armstrong had expended in a little
: over thirty days $"'3,000 without authoriza
tion by the board. The fact that that
amount had been burned up at a time
when the department was working under
a reduced appropriation and when the
schools were known to be in a well-fur
nished condition was so remarkable that
more than a casual Investigation was be
gun and the startling fact uncovered that
a generous lump of that amount was
claimed by Weber & Co., dealers in school
suppliesâ a firm of long and oftentimes
unsavory connection with the School De
partment, In fact, Weber & Co. were rep
i resented by claims aggregating $8000.
School desks made the largest Item in
j the Weber bills. Just why Chairman Con
| lon and Director Gedge, who signed most
of the claims, shouiu buy at that time
enough desks to refurnish half the schools
I in the department was not a self-evident
j fact, so Chairman Holbrook sent George
! Walker, inspector of buildings, out
through the schools to check off every
| new desk that had been put in.
Walker returned with his list and he
I and Holbrook went at once to Weber &
Co.'s, where they demanded the firm's
j books, that they might make a compari
-1 son. The Webers, however, had been
too long in the business with the schools
jto be guilty of a break like that. Instead
! they refused, and promptly informed Con
i lon that the department was onto his
! peculiar work.
Conlon then proved his gratefulness by
throwing Weber &- Co. down. Instead of
standing for an inspection of his requi
sitions, he hurried to the secretary's office
and pulled both requisitions and bills off
the file, thereby preventing Holbrook
from making any comparisons at that
| end and effectively concealing any dis
crepancies that might exist.
Notwithstanding that Conlon's act had
i prevented him from proving it, Holbrook
got up in an open meeting and accused
him of contracting bills in excess of his
allowance without the necessary authori
zation by the board. Relying upon the
fact that he had destroyed all evidence,
Conlon coolly denied that he had done any
| such thing, and there the matter re
mained.
The Finance Committee, however, was
â¢ convinced that ("onion was grafting and
: resumed Its investigation with even
greater vigor than ever. Gedge, who had
i signed with Conlon all of the Weber
requisitions, got nervous, and as chair
| man of the 'Elementary Committee called
| in the principals of the different schools
i and attempted to get them to support
! Conlon by vouching for old requisitions
j and standing for new ones. At the same
time the Finance Committee was making
1 good use of Walker. Through him it
l came into possession of many of Its most
important facts. As a Crlmmins man,
; Gedge counted him a friend and poured
i into his ear most of his intentions and
I all of his troubles. Walker played both
; ends against the middle and promptly car
' ried the result of these little heart-to
! heart talks to Holbrook.
-Crooked George," as Walker is called
! by his political associates, was, however,
i not all Holbrook's; anything he could get

HALF BLIND FROM
ECZEMA
Three Children Afflicted. Whole
Bodies and Faces Sore, Raw
and Bloody Mass.
Tried Doctor after Doctor for
20 Months Without Slightest
Relief. Crying Constantly.
Couldn't Sleep. Tried CUTICURA.
First Application Gave Relief.
Cured in Fourteen Days.
My second child got eczema when seven
months old. Three months later my first child
got it, and following him, the last one, two
years old, fell a victim. For twenty months
they suffered fearful agony. Their whole bod-
.us, especially their faces, were so sore and
raw that tlio little ones were blind half the
time. No words can describe tho suffering of
d v second child, whose whole body was one
bloody mass. He was constantly cry ing, could
get no sleep, and he actually did not look hu-
man. I tried doctor after doctor, but gone af-
forded the slightest relief. I decided to try
('â :ticcra. The first application brought re-
lief in each case, and after fourteen days'
treatment with Cctioura Soap and Cuti-
cura (ointment), the worst case was cured,
and the whole neighborhood is surprised at
the wonderful effect of Cuticura. I continue
the use of Cutiocra Soap for the children,
because it makes the little ones look splendid.

hold of concerning committee matters he
as promptly carried to Gedge, and it was
the simultaneous discovery of his du
plicity by both ends that led him to offer
his resignation two meetings ago. Both
sides of the board having tumbled to his
game, his resignation was refused and he
was then whipped into line by Crimmins
and forsook Holbrook for Conlon and
Gedge.
Upon the resumption of the investiga
tion other facts not bearing directly upon
the point at issue but tending to confirm
the general suspicion were discovered.
The committee could not quite understand
how Payot, Upham & Co. could afford to
pay Gedge $2000 to secure an $8000 paper
and ink contract, as charged ln The Call,
but a little Investigation led to the dis
covery that the Payot-Upham people were
also the actual owners of the Prang sys
tem of drawing, which Gedge worked as
siduously to have accepted, and also that
when that firm desired to accomplish any
thing in the line of a general contract it
usually pooled issues with the agent of
Gunn & Co., the American Book Company,
who has his offices over their stores.
Coupling these facts with the discovery
that Gunn & Co. had succeeded through
Gedge in keeping in use in the schools the
greater number of their books, the com
mittee quit wondering at a small thing
like a $2000 commission and got back to
the main point.
They were interrupted again by the In
formation from Freeman Lewis, who had
been getting from Armstrong all con
tracts for repairing school buildings, was
acting as agent for Conlon. who, with his
cousin Charles H. Shipman, owns a
profitable paint business at 1032 Golden
Gate avenue. It was further learned that
Shipman was the assistant storekeeper
of the School Department, and as such
exercised supervision over the supplies
bought by his partner and cousin, Con
lon. : ;:.
Weber & Co. played the next hand
when they discovered that Conlon had
surreptitiously withdrawn their bills from
the files ln order to impede the commit
tee's investigation. In doing so he had
left them without any security for over
$8000 worth of goods. They promptly pre
pared duplicates of his requisitions and
their agent handed them to Secretary
Simpson with the request that he file
them regularly.
The Finance Committee heard of the
W'ebers' action and called a meeting for
last Tuesday afternoon for the purpose
of comparing the figures gathered by Hol
brook and Walker with the bills as pre
sented. Information had been coming in
that, although the bills footed up $SOOO
and odd, goods to that amount had not
been delivered and that, with the con
nivance of Conlon, the Webers were at
tempting to get even on the $23,000 they
lost by the old Board of Education, and
the committee was determined that the
comparison should be made in order to
substantiate that belief. Conlon was
equally determined that they should not,
and when the Finance Committee met on
j Tuesday and called for them Simpson had
forgotten to file them and himself was
| nowhere to be found. He turned up a day
later and claimed to have lost them, but
Holbrook found them somewhere in the
secretary's office.
That Tuesday afternoon meeting of the
I Finance Committee was nothing if not
j stormy. There was already a plan on
! foot to force Conlon's resignation fro a
the chairmanship of the Supplies Com
' mittee, and ten votes had been secured
:to back it up. Only Gedge and Conlon
: himself were not on the list and they ha
I not been consulted.
Armstrong had been forced to stand
| with some difficulty, but the fact that tie
j was suspected of letting printing con
! tracts to his own firm, under an assumed
name, and that on this account H lbrook
had refused to audit the priming bills.
was used on him for all it was worth, ami
he finally came to time.
During the afternoon Gedge was called
in and some pointed questions put to
him. He was asked flatly for a history
of his connection with Conlon's financial
) manipulations and why he had plunged
Into Conlon's defense every time the probe
; of the committee came close to the mu
ter It was after. He was asked to ex
plain why he had called in the principals
of the school and forced them to back
up Conlon's requisitions whether they
had ever signed them or not. He was
asked also as to his $2000 connection with
the Gunr.s, Payot, Upham and the
Prang drawing books and other things.
He could not answer with any satisfac
tion to himself Conlon.
His reply was startling and convincing.
As a member of the committee said after
ward: "He immediately went into hys
terics and opened a senseless attack on
poor Holbrook."
Turning on Holbrook, his voice choked
with tears, Gedge yelled dramatically:
"I have discovered you at last! You have
deceived me. For a *#ear past you have
been taking me out to champagne sup
pers but enly to get me drunk and make
me tell what I knew."
"Quite so," coolly . retorted Mr. Hol
brook, and then Gedge was permitted to
shed his -tears and his hysterics In the
outer corridor.
It was not over an hour before Conlan
was informed of the board's intention to
force his resignation and he hastened to
Phil Crimmins with the news. Crimmins
pulled President Bergerot down and
forced him to promise that he would not
vote to take Conlon's scalp. He also
called Cole and "Billy" Kemp off. Con
lon himself took the contract to quiet
Armstrong and Ed Head.
He approached the former and asked
him If it were true that he was standing
in to give him a dose. Armstrong replied
that he had to do It, whereupon Conlon
wanted to fight and blazed out, "If you
do, Armstrong, I'll tell everything I
know and we will all go up for It. I've
got no family connections I care a dâ
for and would just as soon go across the
bay for a while as not." Armstrong was
looking for no exposures and he followed
Bergerot and the rest over to Conlon's
end of the argument. .- -\ : :/:\ â
Conlon did not see Head until the next
evening before the regular meeting. The
Finance Committee was holding a dark
lantern session in Superintendent Web
ster's office, and called Conlon in to de
mand his resignation. Conlon came, ail
right enough, and upon seeing Head got
fighting mad and called him several, to
say the least, uncomplimentary names.
He Informed him that if he voted to de
throne him he would prove him a thief of
the first water. Head pot as mad as Con
lon and handed over a few warm packages
of his own. Conlon was then asked tor
his resignation, and, knowing that not
enough votes were left to force him, he
promptly refused to write it. Bergerot
helped him to the extent of getting Head
out of the way by complaining of 'llness
and asking him to take the chair for the
night, and then the committee went down
stairs into open meeting. Head, as per
Bergerot's suggestion, was in the chair,
and all danger to Conlon was at an end.
The Finance Committee, however, in
sisted that he, Gedge and Armstrong be
put in a position to do no more grafting
and to that end adopted a resolution
which provided that all committees
should thereafter have their requisitions
Indorsed by the president of the board
and chairman of the Finance Committee.
On motion of Holbrook all of the bills
except $1600, which Conlon had contracted
with Weber & Co., were repudiated.
Gedge and Conlon claim they are being
persecuted by the "Club Five." While
loudly shouting their innocence of all the
charges proved against them they claim
the reason for it all is that the five are
attempting to force them to stand in on
a deal ~to consolidate the Polytechnic
High School with the Mission High
School, in order to throw Joseph O'Con
nor, the principal, out of his job. They
assert that the scheme is fostered by
former School Director Hyde, who de
sires O'Connor's place for his favorite
Walter Bush. The club faction laughs
, at the story and in reply simply men
tlons a few of the things it has proved
on its accusers. Meantime the investi
gation progresses and there is some good
stuff being furnished the Grand Jury, de
spite Gedge's oft-repeated boast that his
friends have already "fixed" that worthy
body.

A Dr. Jekyll and Hyde Business.
It is an old saying and a true one
that self-praise is no recommendation;
but when people think that the way to
win public favor is to deceive by pretend

has to speak out and sound a note of
warning in behalf of the public, as well
as himself.
Surely Charles Lyons must have the
public favor or new men would not open
stores near him, their only hope being
to try and do business on Lyons reputa

ENTHUSIASTIC REPUBLICANS RATIFY THE WINNING TICKET
Municipal Campaign Is Opened With
a Rousing Rally in Metropolitan
Temple, at Which Horace Davis
Makes a Strong Speech and Re=
ceives a Grand Reception.
Â£â p="}HE first gun In the municipal
! campaign has been fired and from
now on until the last ballot has
II been cast on the 7th of November
,> next the battle for the control of
the government of the city and county
will rage fiercely. Last night the Repub
licans of San Francisco swarmed into
"Metropolitan Temple to ratify the ticket
nominated by the municipal convent of
the party ten days ago in B'nal B'rlth
Hall; and the enthusiasm displayed was
ample proof, if proof were needed, that
they were ln entire accord. The recep
tions accorded the various candidates who
made brief speeches from the platform
during the evening were In every instance
spontaneous In character and full of gen
uine enthusiasm. The candidates were
surprised and delighted, for they were
hardly prepared for such a demonstration
so early In the campaign.
As for Horace Davis, to any Republican
in the city or Democrat either who enter
tained a lingering doubt of his election
previous to last night, the ovation he re
ceived was sufficient answer. From the
moment he first stepped upon the stage
until the band began to play "Rally
Round the Flag" as the audience trooped
out of the building he was cheered at
every opportunity, and when the opportu
nities did not occur often enough to suit
his admirers they made them. Every men
tion of his name brought forth volumes
of applause, and when he arose to ad
dress the gathering the building shook
with the greeting he received. Next to
Mr. Davis, the candidates who seemed to
be most In favor with the audience were
"Honest" John Lackmann. nominee for
Sheriff; Auditor A. R. Wells, and "Billy"
Deane, who is count* certain to be re
elected County Clerk. The reason prob
ably was that they were better known
than the majority of the others, many of
whom were making their first appearance
as candidates for office.
In addition to the speeches of tho can
didates Congressman Kahn and Irving M.
Scott made ringing addresses which
stirred the audience to wild enthusiasm.
The former presided and made that an
excuse for cutting his remarks short, al
though the Republicans present shouted
for him to continue. Mr. Scott also re
fused to consume much time, which he
claimed belonged of right to the nomi
nees of the party, but he spoke long
enough to tell a few politicaJ truths in a
manner that went straight to the mark
and made a deep impression.
Mr. Davis" speech was naturally the
event of the evening, and while the Re
publican nominee for Mayor makes no
pretense to oratorical ability he has a
straightforward, convincing way that
makes every word count. He told his
hearers in the plain language of a man
of business just what the coming elec
tion meant to the people of San Fran
cisco.
He called attention to the great power
conferred on the Mayor by the new char
ter and the necessity of placing that
power in careful and able hands. He re
ferred modestly but with commendable
pride to his political record. He ad
mitted that he had accumulated a compe
tence, saying all he had was acquired in
San Francisco and was all Invested here.
He declared that the Democratic claim
that the new charter was the work of
that party was absurd. He showed that
both parties had considerable to do with
lis preparation, and made a hit by citing
the fact that when the people were. called
upon to vote on its acceptance or rejec
tion the Democratic strongholds were the
only districts ln the city to vote against
it. Dozens of times during the course of
his address the audience interrupted Mr.
Davis with shouts of approval, and when
lie finally took his seat pandemonium
broke loose and cheer after cheer was
given for the "Next Mayor" of San Fran
cisco.
Cheers for Horace Davis.
The first signal for applause was when
Congressman Julius Kahn appeared on
the stage, closely followed by Horace
Davis and the vice presidents. The big
audience cheered until it was hoarse,
completely drowning the music of the
band, which struggled valiantly for a
hearing. Some one proposed three cheers
for the next Mayor and they were given
â with an enthusiasm that proved conclu
sively that the audience was with their"
standard-bearer to a man. Follow;, is

In the absence of Chairman Z. U. Dodge
of the Republican County Central Com
mittee Congressman Kahn presided and
called the meeting to order in a brief
speech. He said:
Julius Kalui Opens the Ball.
"It becomes my pleasant duty to call
this meeting to order in the absence of
the chairman of the county committee,
which Is at present engaged in perfecting
an organization. But we do not want to
keep this audience waiting and so we will
let you hear the candidates tell you what
they propose to do after you have elected
them.
"The people of San Francisco at the

city. Our fellow citizens have poured out
their wealth in a lavish manner to wel
come home the brave boys In blue who
had been fighting under the starry ban

latter have been both amazed and de
lighted with San Francisco's hospitality.
These brave soldiers have returned to
their homes inbued with a feeling of deep
friendliness for the great metropolis of
the Pacific Coast, whose citizens have
honored them with so much good feeling
and cordiality, and they are spreading
over the land the report of what San
Francisco is and what her people are.
"San Francisco has at last obtained its
opportunity. The commerce passing
through our gates to our new possessions
and to the countries of the Orient ..as
materially increased during the past year.
The entire country now recognizes as a
fact that San Francisco has grown to be
one of the great commercial centers u,f
the universe. The poet's dream is at last
about to be realized:
Dared I but say a prophecy
As sang the learned men of old.
Of rock-built cities yet to be
Along these shining shores of gold,

Ovation for Davis.
"That San Francisco has a glorious
future we all know, and we also know
that the welfare of the city will be am
ply protected by our next Mayor, Mr.
Horace Davis (prolonged cheers and
cries of "We will stand by him.") I am
sure you will. I am sure the Republi
cans of San Francisco will all stand by
Mr. Horace Davis. I take great pleasure
in introducing to you our next Mayor,
Hon. Horace Davis." (Great applause.)
Mr. Davis stepped to the front of the
stage, but it was several seconds before
he was allowed to begin his address. Ho
spoke as follows:
"Mr. Chairman, My Friends, Fellow
Citizens and Neighbors: 1 fear that it is
but cold comfort you will get from me
in comparison with the poetic spirit of
my friend Mr. Kahn, who has just ad
dressed you. I thank you for your cor
dial reception to me. I feel that this elec
tion we are coming to is one thai ha ex
cited unusual interest in the commun-
I ity. 1 see it in the excited condition of
the newspapers already at this early
stage of the proceedings connected with
the election. I see it in the very re
markable registration, equal already to
that of a Presidential year. 1 see that
the people are taking the deepest interest
in the affairs of this campaign.
"Now there are two reasons that con
duce to this. One is an honest primary
and one is the new charter. -.Applause.'
Now the honest primary is the portal
that must lead you to tne new charter.
To have the new charter without the
honest primary is of but little use to us
because It is no use to have good ma
chinery without the means of driving it,
and it is no use to have a good charter
without we have the honest primary to
lead up to It.
"I look upon this primary we have had
this year as the most hopeful sign In all
the politics we have had for twenty years.
The sober, serious citizens are taking an
interest in politics this year because tho
politics are their politics, and not the
politics of the machine; not the politics of
the bosses. This year politics Is the poll
tics of the honest voter himself. tAp
plause.)
Believes in the People.
"I have confidence enough in the good
sense and Integrity and patriotism ot the
average citizen to believe that when he
can he wants to take his share In public
affairs. 1 have no faith in those pessi
mistic statements that interest in public
affairs is dying out. I do not believe a
word of it. i believe there is just as
much interest in public affairs, just as
much patriotism, Just as much honest In
terest In government in the citizens to
day as there ever was, only they have not
had a chance to show it for the last
twenty years.
"Now, 1 have been a good deal sur
prised. I have been told that our Demo
cratic friends have claimed this primary
law as part of their property, 1 nave no
doubt that there are as many men among
the leaders of the Democratic party that
have wanted good politics as on our. side,
and when the gentlemen got together and
formulated this law they were composed
of men of both parties, but when the law
was sent up to Sacramentoâ you know the
title by which It Is known Is the Strab
ton lawâ it was introduced into tho Legis
lature by that very patriotic and excel
lent gentleman, Mr. Stratton, the Repub
lican Senator from Oakland; it was
passed by a Republican House; it was
passed by a Republican Senate and signed
by a Republican Governor and carried out
faithfully here in this city by a very pa
tient, honest, upright and fair Republican
Registrar. Now I do not see in that
wherein the Democrats have -any very se
rious claim to call the primary law a part
of their property, but, passing by that,
let us come to the charter itself. It Is the
real meat of the nut we are after to
night.
Democrats Opposed the Charter.
"I was very much astonished the other
night to sco in a paper that the Demo
cratic convention passed a resolution *Â£at
the charter was carried mainly by Dent
ocratic votes; that it was mainly the
product of Democratic intelligence. What
is the truth of that? I was a member of
the convention of 100 which formulated
the charter. Our convention was com
posed of men of all parties. There was
no' politics in the convention. We met
ilke sober business men and discussed
the provisions of ihe charter. We werj
several weeksâ some' months, in facâ
working over it. There was no partisan
ship inside of that convention. We stood
shoulder to shoulder like sensible men
working out a good form of government
for the city. We did a great deal of work
and we accomplished a great deal of re
sult.
" After the charter was out of our hands
we nominated Freeholders and they,
again, were composed equally of both
parties. When the Freeholders had put
it Into the shape It Is in to-day and passed
out of their hands It was ratified by a
meeting in this hall, and then it was sent
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1899.
to a verdict of the popular vote. And if
you will look at the vote in the city at
that time, if you will analyze It by dis
tricts, you will see that every district
that yielded a majority against the char
ter was a Democratic district. (Ap
plause.) I have not observed that any
Democratic papers have noticed that
point. (Laughter.)
"Now, after the charter passed from the
people it went to Sacramento and was
passed by a Republican Legislatureâ
both housesâ signed by a Republican
Governor. (Applause.) I don't care much
about their talk, but when they make
such claims as that for something the
right and wrong of which belongs to
HORACE DAVIS ADDRESSING THE REPUBLICANS IN METROPOLI
TAN TEMPLE.
neither party but was the joint work of
honest men on both sides desirous of good
government, I say it should be left where
it belongs as being the production of tho
honest, good-government-loving part of
the community; regardless of party. (Ap
plause.)
Worked for It and Voted for It.
"And let me say one word before I leave
it as to my own part in it, because some
thing has been said about that. I was a
member of the convention. I attended all
meetings, or nearly all, besides meetings
of the committees. 1 voted for the Free
holders, and after the Freeholders had
formulated the charter I voted for the
charter, and when it was finally ratified
by the people and went to Sacramento I
used all the lnfiuence I had with Individ
ual members of the Legislature to secure
Its ratification by the Legislature. Pardon
me for this bit of personal mention, be
cause I am proud of my part, of my con
nection with the charter, and cannot en
dure to have it questioned without mak
ing this denial.
"When the charter question came up in
the convention there were many among
us who would have liked a charter with a
large body of Supervisors and a Mayor
with very limited powers. That is what
you might call the English fashion. Then
there was another party which wanted a
charterâwhich proved to be in an over
whelming majority in the conventionâ in
favor of what I call the American plan.
That is a plan which prevails to some ex
tent in America. At all events. it provid
ed for a moderate-sized Board of Super
visors and gave the Mayor a great deal of
power and responsibility. As I said, this
so-called American plan proved to be the
one most in favor in the convention. Under
this system the Supervisors hold the same
relation to the other departments of the
government that Congress does to the
United ales Government or the Legis
lature does to the State governmentâ the
Board of Supervisors has legislative pow
er and- at the same time the power that
levies the taxes after they are levied and
appropriates them. But the power of ex
pending the money lies In the hands of
seven boards or commissions that are ap
pointed by the Mayor.
Great Power of the Mayor.
"Now let me enumerate to you these
boards to show you what great power the
Mayor has under its provisions. There Is
the Board of Public Works, which has
charge of the streets and the sewers and
the buildings belonging to the city. There
is the Board of Educationâ the Mayor has
the appointing of consisting of four.
There is the Board of Police Commission
ers, which are now appointed by the Gov
ernor, you know; it will be appointed by
the Mayor. There Is the Hoard of Fire
Commissioners. There is the Civil Serv
ice Commission, which Is to prepare and
formulate the rules for examination for
appointments to the city service. The
Board of Healthâ you all know of themâ
and the Park Commission.
"These seven very important boards are
appointed by the Mayor, and they have
practically the expending of the money
which is provided by taxation. You see at
once that it is a position of great power,
of great responsibility; that It requires a
man of cool head and clear judgment and
wide experience, of good knowledge of
men, and above all It needs a man who is
both honest and fearless. (Applause.) I
have detailed this to you that you may
understand what his responsibilities are,
what the powers of the Mayor are and
what the responsibilities are that attach
to that office; and this first year of the
new charter, you will understand, ho has
the entire fining of all these boards. After
that only one a year upon each board is
appointed by the Mayor, but the first
year the Mayor has to appoint all the
members of all these Important boards
Benefit of Public Utilities.
"Now, then, one other matter In the
charter I would like to say a word to
you about because a great deal of the
lime of the convention was devoted to It
and that Is the matter of public utilities'
Public utilities are those things that are
used by the general publicâ if the streets
have to be used, especially. These are
gas, water and street railroads. Theso
are all public utilities. Under the new
charter special provision Is made that the
city by a vote of the people can determine
upon the means of acquiring these utili
ties whenever they desire them. Now
the custom of different cities varies very
much In reference to these matters. Al
most all large American cities own their
own waterworks. Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, St. Louis, Washington, all
own their own water supply. Some cities '
| own the gas supply; others do not. Some
I even own their street railroads, or
! partly own them, but most do not. Bos
i ton, for example, has provided a tunnel,
i or subway, as she calls it, two mllc3 long
j under the center of the city for the pass-
I age of the cars. At an expense of several
million dollars they built this tunnel and
took the cars from the surfac-j nnd put
them under the highways from end to
end of the city. And litre is in example
we might hold out to our own city: that
tunnel was built for less than the esti
mated expenditure and for less than the
amount that was appropriated to build it.
Think of it; anything being done for less
than the estimated cost and less than the
money provided to do it with. Whenever,
by reason of honest primaries and the in
terest you take in the election, we reach
the point where we shall be able to build
things for less than the estimated cost, or
that we shall be able to do our work econ
omically, then whenever the people think
the moment has arrived, under this new
charter they have the power to say the
word to purchase any or all of the public
utilities of the city (Applause.) Then we
shall own municipal waterworks, and if
we see fit. to buy them, our own gasworks.
And we have it in our power under this
new charter at any time by fair and hon
orable purchase to take possession of any
ior all railways and make use of the
streets of the city. Now, there are many
other provisions in your platform on many
of the other provisions of the charter of
which I have not time to speak to-night.
I will pass on now, and with a few words
more I will close.
Friend of Working-men.
"I have been a citizen of this city since
I cast my first vote. All the property I
have accumulated was accumulated here.
And it has been invested here (applause)
mainly In Industrial enterprises, which
have contributed to the growth of the
city and which have employed a large
body of men from the time when I first
began business In ISGO* clear down to the
present time. During the earlier part of
this period my contact with labor, which
was always pleasant, brought me to see
many things that otherwise I should not
have noticed. It called my attention to
some circumstances that I deem give
grave peril to the community. I refer es
pecially to the great flood of fore'gn
labor which at that time threatened this
city. I do not think we realize ourselves
how great the danger was to this com
munity. We were then a long way from
New York and it was a very expensive
passage, while the trip from China over
here was a short one and a very cheap
one and it was very easy at that time to
have filled this coast full of Asiatics.
There was serious danger at that time
that this city might have become Asiati
clzed instead of Americanized.
"However, these things have passed off
so long ago that we do not realize it, but
it impressed me and as far back as 1553
I communicated with the leading papers
in New York and called their attention to
the singular peril of this coast being
Asiatlcizedâ of becoming not American
but Asiatic in population and tendency;
and later when the attention of the com
munity here had been called to it and
when we were all much exercised by tne
presence of bands of unemployed men
parading the streets and threatening prop
ertyâmen who claimed that they had
been thrown out of work by the presence
of these Chinamen among us, when at
last this unwelcome truth was driven
home we went to Congress to see If we
could not' get it recognized. Then it was
my good fortune to be able to do my
share in stemming the tide and in chang
ing the sympathies of the Eastern peo
ple and winning them over to our side
and help to close the doors to bar out
these unwelcome intruders. (Applause.)
. Great Growth of the City.
"Happily for us. these times passed
away and these perils passed with them
and from that time Until now there has
been no cloud that has arisen In our hori
zon that to my mind was anything like
as threatening as that. Our city has
grown with the State and with the growth
of manufactures in our midst. Our com
merce has increased during the last three
or four years especially. As stated by my
learned friend who preceded me, the
commerce of this city has grown by leaps
and bounds. Wherever the flag goes
trade goes with It, and as the stars and
stripes have been raised over terri
tory other than what they were
raised over five years ago. as they, have
been raised over new territory new trade
has come and we of this city have re
ceived the benefit of It. .
"I believe we have no conception of the
commerce that Is destined to spring up
between this coast and the teeming mil
lions of Asia and we here shall receive the
full share of It. Our country, thanks to
the wise policy of protection, has become
I an exporter of manufactured goods, and
the ships that go from this port over to
Chinaâ something like seven or eight each
monthâ are filled full with American
products bound for the millions of Asia
steel rails, cotton goods, flour, wine all
j the products of this American territory
I are exported, and we receive In return
the silks and the oil and the goods of
Asia. This trade Is destined to increase
to an amount we can have to-day no Im
agination of, and with it our city will
grow, and if we are wise and If under this
new charter we are able to provide just
and economical and wise government I
think the wildest Imagination of any
man here will fail to realize the possibili
ties of the future of San Francisco.
"Let us then be up and doing. Let us
provide wise government and sound laws.
Let us see that the city is kept in the
right and the sound course and with an
honest primary and good citizens taking
an interest In the new charter and a
sound and economical government, the
Increasing foreign trade, bringing millions
of wealth Into our coffers, 1 see In the
future San Francisco marching forward
with the front rank of modern great mu
nicipalities." (Applause.)
Great Reception to I. M. Scott.
When the. uproar of cheering had sub
sided Chairman Kahn arose and said:
"When I was In Washington last win
i ter I was surprised and delighted at the
attention which had been attracted to
California and San . Francisco since the
breaking out of the war with Spain. I
knew this was a great city and I knew
some of the reasons for its greatness I
had seen the battleships Oregon and the
Olympia; but it was not until 1 saw the
Oregon and Olympia in action that I un
derstood clearly what you Californians
mean when you exclaim 'Great Scott '
(Laughter and applause.) Gentlemen, it
gives me great pleasure to introduce to
you Irving M. Scott." (Uproarious ap
plause.) .\",
As soon as he could make himself heard
Mr. Scott said:
"I came down here' to-night to ask
every Republican and every good citizen
to vote a straight Republican ticket from
top to bottom at the next election. There
"is not a nominee on the ticket that any
one need feel ashamed for having voted
for. My Democratic friends claim the
credit for this new charter. I have been
connected with the framing of every
charter that has been presented to the
people of San Francisco until the last
one, and that Is the only one that the
citizens voted in favor of. It is a good
law and only a humbug would make the
assertion that the Republicans would not
enforce it. We showed the people what
we could do when we framed the charter
and we will show them what we intend
to do when we elect Horace Davis Mayor
"Mr. Davis, In his modesty, did not say
that he was going to administer the new
law, but I will say it for him. The city is
on the verge of liberation from the chains
that made her a captive of corruption and
political bosses. The Republican party
has always been opposed to the misap
propriation of public funds, and now Is
the time to elect men who can be trusted
and who are known to be true to every
trust that was ever Imposed upon them
Let me tell you that Horace Davis has all
ways been on the firing line in the battle
for good government.
California Always in Front.
"California has been foremost in many
of the most important events of the na
tion. In our great civil strife the stream
of gold that we poured from our mines
into the national treasury was the tie
that bound together the two extremes of
the nation. California put the first vol
unteer regiment in the field during the
Rebellion. In the late war with Spain it
was a California built ship that carried
the day off Santiago. When the Oregon
trained her guns on the Spanish vessels,
running at a speed she had never reached
before, doing frightful execution with her
batteries, her work was the triumph of
California mechanics."
Charles J. King, candidate for Super
visor, followed Mr. Scott. He said he had
been a resident of the city since 1849. and
although a native of the District of Co
lumbia had been raised In the , city by
the Golden Gate.

Congressman Julias Kahn Presides
and the Great Audience Is Kept
in a Ferment of Applause by the
Eloquence and Telling Remarks
of the Speakers.
' which the city has passed and appre- i
ciated that there was never a more im
portant time than now. It Is the first
time the people have been given an op- ;
portunity to vote for a local government
of the people, tor the people and by the ;
people.
Tne next to be introduced was Asa R.
Wells, and as the Auditor advanced to
the front of the stage he was given a
flattering welcome, ilia remarks were
brief, but every word told.
Asa B. Wells' Telling Speech.
"I think most of you have seen me be
fore; you have certainly heard of me,"
he said, whereat there was a general
laugh. "I am your Auditor and a can
didate for re-election to that office, If
you remember when I took that offico
there was trouble at the City Hall. The
funds were ln a bad state; they were all
short, and it required a great deal of fig
uring to keep out of pitfalls. I believe I
have steereu clear ot the pitfalls and I
have made no mistakes. 1 certainly have
not been accused of making any mis
takes." Referring to the new charter Mr.
Wells said he believed that one of the
great reasons why tho people voted for
that instrument was the discontent and ;
complaint against the School Depart
ment at that time. He then referred to
that provision of the charter that gives |
the Mayor authority to appoint the mem
bers oÂ£ the School Board, and said:
"If Mr. Davis is elected do you believe
that with his knowledge of school affairs
he is going to make any mistakes in j
making these appointments? I believe the
majority of the people of San Francisco
are honest and that they will vote tor an
honest man and an honest administra
tion. Is there any reason why he stiouia
not be elected? (Cries of "No, no. ) in
early days Mr. Davis was a neighbor] jt)f
mine, as he was of Irving M. Scott, Â«* I
there was not a man in Tar Plat that
ever had a word to say against him. He
was spoken of as 'one of the men tnat
God made.' (Applause.)
"Mr Davis did not have a fortune left
to him; that is the man we should have.
A man that has done something for him
self is the man that is most likely to do
something for us There are over 72,000
voters registered in this city and that is
very encouraging to the Republican
party, for it is well known that when
there is a large registration It means it
Is a Republican year." (Long continued j
applause.) . , __ â  _.
Black Nails a Lie.
Chairman Kahn then introduced A. P.
Black, candidate for District Attorney,
who was cordially received. He said.
"It has been my honor to serve the peo
ple of this city in a subordinate position ,
and my ono object was to do my wh * â¢
duty and to do it well. I ask you people
now to answer me whether I have d^.ie
so.' I ask my friends if they can find
aught against my record not to vote for
me and if I cannot win by fair means I
don't want to be elected. A man never
knows how 'Black' ; he is until he runs
for office. The Examiner says that I am
an enemy of labor and an advocate of
low wages; that the Musicians Lnlon
has boycotted me. What a preposterous
idea. lam satisfied that of 500 votes from
the Musicians' Union I will receive at
least 475
"Any man who makes a living by hard
work should be ashamed to call himself
a Democrat. High wages for a fair day s
labor has always been the policy of the
Republican party. This policy of the
party stands most resplendent in the **;s
--tory of the country, from the time Lin
coln found the ship of state scuuieu oy
the Democrats and steered it through a
bloody war till at last McKinley took the
vessel and sailed it well out into the
ocean of world powers and prosperity.
Fellow Republicans, if .the party that has
saved this nation is not to be supported
by you, you don't deserve to live under
its stars "and stripes."
Louis Feusier, candidate for Treasurer,
promised if elected to run his office in a
thoroughly businesslike way.
Samuel Foster indorsed the ticket and
said that he would support the Mayor in
his administration and try to satisfy the
people with an economical, conservative
administration and work for the orna
mentation and beautifying of San Fran
cis i
Dr. A. P. McLean, candidate for Coro
ner, indorsed the ticket and said that he
would give a good, clean administration
if elected. â â â '.' ">â <â¢â  _
L. G. Carpenter, candidate for Police
Judge, advised his hearers to work hard
for the rest of the campaign for the entire
ticket and not to be humbugged by the
talk of some Democrats that whichever
party wins the following out of the lines
of the charter would assure a good ad
ministration. That talk, he said, was like
the arrangement proposed by the rooster
to the horse not to step on each other's
toes. .7 ' .
Honest John Lackmann Cheered. -
When the chairman called on the candi
date for Sheriff, some one proposed
"Three cheers for honest John Lack
mann," and they were given with a will.
Mr. Lackmann said that there were but
few orators in the present Board of Su
pervisors, and that he was not one of
them, and confined his remarks to a
promise of an honest administration to
the people if elected. He hoped, how
ever, not to. see any of his listeners in
an official capacity after his election.
William Z. Tiffany, candidate for Re
corder, after indorsing the ticket, as
sured his hearers that his employes would
take home their entire salaries to their
families. If the Supreme Court should
decide that there shall be no election for
county officers this year Mr. Tiffany
promised to take off his coat and help to
elect Davis.
William A. Deane, the present County
Clerk, said that he had kept within his
pledge and would, if re-elected, continue
to do so.
William Watson Makes a Hit.
William Watson, candidate for Super
visor, made quite an impression on the
audience in his plain, frank manner.
"This is my first experience In politics,"
he said, "and you can tell by my looks
that I have been in no hurry. If elected
I will not be for sale. They cannot buy
me nor buy my vote. I am a mechanic
and, having by good fortune accumulated
enough to live on, I retired several years
ago. If I am' elected I will give my en
tire time to the duties of the office."
Dr. E. N. Torello, when introduced, said
that he was no orator. His business was
to heal wounds, not to inflict them. With
an undertaker on the board with him he
felt sure that if elected they would be
successful as a combination.
Joseph H. Scott, candidate for Tax Col
lector, Judge Joachimsen and James
Nagle, candidates for Police Judges, in
short speeches indorsed the ticket.
This concluded the speechmaklng, and
after three rousing cheers for the Repub
lican party and three more for Horace
Davis, the crowd filed out of the building
while the band played "Rally Round the
Flag."
COMMITTEE ORGANIZES.
Al Bouvier Elected Chairman
of the Davis Campaign.
The new Republican County Central
Committee met and organized last even
ing at the Davis headquarters, 723 Mar
ket street. The members were called to
order by Sheldon Kellogg, who presided
over the Republican municipal conven
tion. Alfred Bouvier was elected chair
man, John R. Hillman and Thomas Duff,
vice chairman, James A. Wilson secre
tary and Nathan H. Frank treasurer.
In taking the chair Mr. Bouvier said
that he did so with a full knowledge of
the work it entailed and the responsibili
ties that went with It. He expressed the
hope that at the end of the campaign the
committeemen would be satisfied that
their confidence had not been misplaced.
"We have only one object," he said, "and
that is the election of the entire Republi
can ticket from top to bottom."
There was some discussion over the ap
pointment of the executive committee,
several members arguing that it should
consist of thirty-six committeemen, while
others expressed the opinion that a com
mittee so large would be too- unwieldy to
accomplish any good. The matter was
disposed of by leaving it entirely to the
discretion of the chair.
The question of the disposition of the
caucus and convention funds and the pay
ment of the bills was referred to a com
mittee consisting of the officers of the
County Committee and Messrs. Kellogg
and Lewis.
A resolution was received, purporting to
come from the Central Republican
League, denouncing Mr. Kellogg for ap
pointing John J. Curry on the County
Committee In place of Frank P. Shlveley,
whom the delegation had recommended.
The resolution charged that Curry was a
Democrat. Curry and others from the
Forty-third District stated that the
league had held no meeting and that the
resolution was unauthorized. The com
plaint was referred to the executive com
mittee.
TWO STALWARTS
FOR SUPERVISOR.
I. J. TRUMAN.
The special committee, of which Judge
Schell is chairman, appointed by the Re
publican municipal convention to fill va
cancies on the ticket, met yesterday and
formally appointed I. J. Truman, presi
dent of the Columbia Bank, and E. P.
Barrett of the Stock and Bond Exchange
to fill the vacancies left by Messrs. Kos
ter and Britton in the list of Supervis
orial candidates. The Registrar will be
notified to make the necessary changes
on the ticket according to law.
PEOPLE'S PARTY
MAY SECURE A
BIG CHIEFTAIN
Judge Maguire forthe
Mayoralty.
Senator R. Porter Ashe, who was nomi
nated for Mayor by the People's party
convention, has declined to accept the
nomination, although his acceptance was
urged by a large body of his Democratic
fellow citizens. The argument was ad
vanced that the convention had a
stronger Democratic following than the
McNab-Phelan convention, and that ac
ceptance of the Populist leadership would
add to his prestige in the Democratic
party. Senator Ashe gave his reasons for
declining in the following letter:
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 13.
Messrs. A. B. Kinne, William Meakin and
Aaron Wasch. People's Party Committee â
Gentlemen: When the committee from the
People's party convention waited upon me at
my office Saturday morning, October 7, and
asked me to become the convention's candi
date for Mayor I declined the honor, stating
that I had submitted my name to the Demo
cratic municipal convention the night before
for the nomination for District Attorney and
that submission precluded me from accepting
a nomination at your hands, even if I felt at
liberty, as a Democrat, to accept the same
under existing conditions. Since this oral
declination your convention has placed me in
nomination for Mayor.
While I am not insensible to the honors you
have conferred, and . I use the word honor
advisedly, I am constrained to moat positively
renew the declination.
The true Democratic principles expressed in
the platform of your convention appeal to my
s'âipathies and I cannot but regret that the
Democratic municipal convention was not
equally definite and explicit in its declarations
upon national Issues. Very respectfully yours,
- R. PORTER ASHE.
It is understood that James G. Maguire
or some other well-known Democratic ad
vocate of free silver doctrine will accept
the first place on the People's party
ticket. Judge Maguire was out of town
last night and therefore was not waited
upon by the committee. -.

Simpson's Auditorium, with the largest
seating capacity of any church or theater
In the city, opened its doors on Sunday
morning, October *, to receive the con
gregation of the new independent non
sectarian religious society incorporated as
"The Independent Church of Christ."
The pastor. Rev. J. S. Thompson, was
for seven years pastor of the Church of
the Unity (Unitarian) here, and in 1897
was called to the pastorate of the Uni
tarian church on the North side in Chi
cago, where he remained until he accepted
the call to the Independent church here.
A handsome tribute was paid to Rev.
Mr. Thompson's oratorical powers, to his
scholarly ability and towering genius as
both minister and man in that on .the
occasion of his first sermon in the new
church an immense congregation of our
leading thinkers, students and best citi
zens listened most interestedly to his ser
mon on the subject, "Christ's Doctrine of
Life."
On Tuesday evening the members and
friends of the church gave a reception
in the Auditorium in honor of Rev. Mr.
Thompson and his wife. Among the re
ception committee were Judge and Mrs.
John M. Miller, Mr. and Mrs. L. W. Blinn
and Mr. and Mrs. Charles T. Parsons.

smilax, white satin ribbons and chrysan
themums erected in one of the drawing
rooms. ".'.â ' w

Redondo where Mr. Ainsworth, who is
proprietor of the Redondo Hotel, has
built a beautiful home for his bride.
Another equally notable wedding, which
also took piace on Wednesday evening,
was that of Miss Annie May Wethern to
Mr Hermann Henry Kerckhoff. The
ceremony, which was performed by Rev.
C J. K. Jones of the Cnurch of the Unity
took place at Hotel Roslyn, five of the
parlors being thrown together and beau
fully and artistically decorated with a
profusion of tulle, ribbon, smllax and
flowers. The bride, who is a niece of Mr.
and Mrs. D. G. Stephens, was given away
by her uncle and wore a gown of heavy
cream satin trimmed with lace, which her
aunt wore at her own wedding.

of the large Eastern cities and will return

ALASKA IS VERY
HARD TO GOVERN
Senator Shoup Speaks
of the Difficulties.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOTSK CITY, Idaho. Oct. 14.-Senator
Shoup has just returned from an official
trip to Alaska, taken as chairman of the
Senate Committee on Territories for the
purpose of acquainting himself with leg
islative needs there. He is radically op
posed to giving Alaska a Territorial form
of government at this time.
He .says while he found opinion on the
question divided he ascertained to his
personal satisfaction that those who
would have to bear the burden of Ter
ritorial government are opposed to it
The floating population naturally desire.*
the Alaska be forthwith granted the full
powers of a Territory, but that class
would not share in the tremendous ex
pense.
The Senator is of the firm conviction
that nothing would retard the growth of
Alaska more than a Territorial form of
government. The tost of maintaining
such a government would be enormous
and taxation would be equivalent to con
â¢iscation. The cost of holding an elec
tion there would be aimost enough to
bankrupt the average State. Senator
Shoup lavors giving Alaska a separate
Civil Code, however, and he will report
on it when Congress convenes. At pres
ent Alaska is under the civil Code of
Oregon. There is but one United States
Judge, whose jurisdiction is so large as
to appall the average visitor who takes
the trouble to look over the map. It is
2200 miles from end to end. To get wit
nesses lrom distant parts of Alaska to
this court involves a tremendous ex
pense to the Government. Senator Shoup
will recommend the appointment of two
more Judges for Alaska, with an ad
ditional United States Marshal and
United States Attorney for each court so
established.
He also recommended the appointment
of more United States Commissioners,
there being but nine at present, and of a
deputy marshal for each Commissioner
He will also recommend that the juris
diction of the Commissioners be In
creased so they can determine the civil
actions to a Limit of $1000. He also fa
vors granting lem all the powers of a
Probate Court.
The Senator announces bis strenuous
opposition to making any concession to
Canada in the matter of the boundary
that would give the Dominion a port oil
the American coast.

MAKING TROUBLE
Object to Painting a
Transport White.
The British ships under contract to the
! Government as transports are not spend-
I ing any more money here than they can
! help. All the repair v. ork, as far as pos
sible, is being done by the ships' crew,
j while the Chinese sailors are doing the
i painting. There was a email sized riot
aboard the Tartar when the coolies were
I ordered over the side to paint the vessel
| white. They do not like the color and
| made a vigorous protest, but that was
| all the good it did them. All of yesterday
; a swarm of bare-footed and bare-armed
j Mongolians hung over the side of the
j steamer and wielded the paint hrusn dili
i gently. The quartermaster, who kept
i watch on the proceedings, compelled the
I Mongols to do their duty.
On the Olympia the Chinese also did the
! painting, but on the Newport the regular
I staff of white men did the work. The
j latter vessel has to be painted both inside
I and out. '1 he officers say that the lis
| charged soldiers who came up from Ma
j niia on her ere "the filthiest set of men
who ever set foot aboard a vessel." So
foul was 'I.'- Newport that she had to be I
fumigated when three days from port, so
as to make her fit for inspection by the
Health Officer.
A great deal of unmerited blame has
I been placed on the officers of the Newport
;in connection with the last voyage. On
all chartered transports the officers of
the ship have nothing whatever to do
t with the feeding of the soldiers or passen
gers sent home by the army officials.
â¢ Uncle Sam provides his own cooks and
! food, and on the Newport the discharged
j men got all the army regulations called
j for, and more. They were given "free
I transportation," but demanded "first
| class accommodation, and because it
j was refused *h* m fouled the ship from
i end to end. Therefore, while one Set of
pointers was putting a white coat on the
outside of the Newport yesterday, an
l other gang was removing the traces left
by the discharged soldiers from the in-
I tcrior.
The ships Sintram and Two Brothers
, and the tender Kadiak. the last of the
, salmon fleet, made port yesterday. They
! left here with about forty other vessels
; last soring and have now reached port
; with the clean-up of the canneries. Bach
i vessel left a few hundred cases at the
' different stations, and these the Two
Brothers and Bintram have picked up and
brought down with them.

; Pacific Steam Whaling Company, three
;to Hume Brothers & Hume, two to the
North American Commercial Company

sels were scattered among various own
j ers. The entire fleet brought down about
I a million cases and 20,000 barrels of sal
mon, which Is an average catch. The
I largest cargo, 70,722 cases, was carried by
the W. H. Macy, while the America

George Skolfield 50,000 cases.

The Yoyo Risen Kaisha's steamer

land many of the passengers were glad
:to secure sleeping room on sofas. Among

Arguments in Mills Case*,
REDWOOD CITY, Oct. 14.â One more
day and the contest over the estate of I
Robert Mills will be in the hands of the
Jury- Attorneys Tenury, Powell and
Richards consumed all of to-day in argu
ment. Richards began shortly after noon

night's lodging the family had to pay
nothing, a charitable woman who had
known Dussen in better days taking
them Into her own crowded quarters.
It became necessary for Dussen to
obtain shelter for his family, and
through the efforts of the same bene
factressânone too rich herself he ob
tained permission from George Center,
the owner of the lot at Sixteenth
street and Potrero avenue, to pitch
thereon the tent he concluded to pur
chase. A small campers' tent, 10x10,
torn and tattered, was purchased by
Dussen for J* and placed on the lot.
In It he put the few absolutely neces
sary pieces of furniture, the bedclothes
and the oil stove he had also been
compelled to buy out of his small
store of money. It was Impossible for
the Inmates to move around In the
dilapidated tent, and again the
which the father, Rowland Chatham, was
always Its respected head, was honored
and loved by the children from their in
fancy and mourned by them when dead.
Dealing with the legal aspect of the case
the speaker dwelt on the fact that chil
dren born in wedlock are presumed to be
the offspring of their visible parents. As
there was nothing to show that Chatham
nnd wife did not live in harmony except
idle rumor the case of the plaintiffs was
not proven. George C. Ross will conclude
tor the plaintiffs Monday, after which
Judge Buck will deliver the charge and
submit the case.
AN EX-SHERIFF OF
MARIN PASSES AWAY
Prediction of John Gannon's Supersti
tious Friends That He Would Not
Pass Friday Proves a Reality.
SAX RAFAEL, Oct. 14.â John Gannon,
an old pioneer of Marin County, passed
away last evening of pneumonia at the
advanced age of 71 years. While he was
believed to be improving in health, the
prophecy of several of his superstitions
friends that he would have a "hard haul
to pass Friday, the 13th of the month. '
proved true. '7"."",'-'
, Gannon was Sheriff of Marin County ln
the early sixties and Under Sheriff under
Peter Austin. For several years he had
been one of the Constables of San Rafael
Township and was known to every person
in the county. He was born in Kings
County, New York, and passed the early
: part of his life aboard a man-of-war. He
; came to this county in 184U, living first at
Bolinas, and teamed for one of the first
Government sawmills in the State, sit
uated in Baltimore Canyon, near Lark
spur.
His wife died seven years ago and his
only surviving relative is a sister, the
wife of Hon. Thomas Estey. The remains
have been taken charge of by Undertaker
Eden and the funeral arrangements will

BONDHOLDER SUES.
Seeks to Recover From Browns Val
ley Irrigation District.
MARYSVILLE, Oct. 14.â A Deputy
United States Marshal served papers at
Browns Valley in this county to-day on
Byron Burriss, president of the Browns
Valley Irrigation District, in a suit
brought in the United States Circuit
Court by George Parker, a citizen of
Great Britain, who seeks to recover de
linquent interest amounting to $0447 on
bonds of the district held by him. The
Browns Valley Irrigation District em
braces 45,000 acres of land lying twelve
miles to the northeast of Marysville.
There has been much litigation in the
State courts over this district and its
bonds and Judge Gray. Bitting in ..he Su
perior 'Court of Yuba County some, few
months since, declared the bonds issued
by the district to be invalid. There is
$140,000 of the bonds outstanding and but
little has been paid on them in the shape
of Interest since their issuance. This is
the first action against this district which
has been brought in any court by the
bondholders. The works of the Browns
Valley district stand completed and are
In successful operation.

wretched silk-dyer was forced to pay
out more money for canvas and sec
ond-hand clothes, with which he erect
ed an addition to the tent.
Just at this time, when the head of
the family found himself entirely out
of money and was preparing to go
into the city to look for work of any
kind, the rains came on. Through the
holes in the tent the water poured on
the wretched family. The only heat
they had came from the oil stove,' the
fuel for which had to be used sparing
ly. The only food they had was a little
flour and some potatoes. Shivering
and starving, watching the sufferings
of their young, the parents stood it,
battling the rain for two days. Yes
terday they weakened and the father
appealed for assistance to the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren.
Agent McMurray called at the place
during the afternoon and found things
as wretched as Dussen had represented.
The sunshine was the only brightening
influence, and in it the little boys-
Charley, aged 3, and Harry, aged 5â
bustled about, helping their father to
straighten out rusty oil cans to make
a covering on the ground upon which
to erect a platform when he can af
ford the lumber upon which to move
his tent. The baby girl was sleeping
inside the tent, while her mother was
busily engaged in washing a few
things and watching the boiling of
some potatoes on a stove arranged on
the lot through the necessities of pov
erty. On the ground was a tire. Over
it nad been placed a cast-off wash
boiler. On top of this boiler a cast
iron wash tub was used as a pot.
Aside from Its poverty, the Dussen
family is all right. The children are ;
healthy and the parents are willing to
work, the father being anxious to turn
his hand to anything that will bring
bread and warmth to his wife and
littlo ones.
PRISON BOARD
IS NOT A UNIT
The Folsom Penitentiary
Without a Warden.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Oct. 14.â
Contrary to expectations the State Pris
on directors did not elect anybody to
succeed the deceased Warden Hale as
head of the Folsom Prison at their regu
lar monthly meeting to-day. The reason
given for this delay by four of the direc
tors was that there is no hurry as regards
succeed the deceased Warden Aull as
captain of the guard Murphy Is perfectly
competent to manage the institution ln
accordance with the most modern penolog
ical principles, but it is suspected by sev
eral who have been watching proceedings
that the real trouble is a disagreement
among the members of the board as to
whether the deceased warden shall be
succeeded b- a Democrat or a Repub
can.
Directors Devlin and Hayes are the only
Republican members of the board, and
consequently the Democrats have a ma
jority and can control the election. It Is
pretty well understood that Directors I
Fitzgerald, Wilkins and Ray are in favor
of honoring the unwritten law and plac
ing a Democrat in the position, while the'
failure to act at this time would seem to ;
indicate that their Republican confreres
would be pleased with a radical departure
from the rule and would like to see a Re
publican the head of both the State pris
ons. William Ashe, brother of Attorney
Dorter Ashe., was present as a candidate
for the position, but departed without the
satisfaction of knowing that the plum
had fallen to his lot.
Warden Agulrre reported that through
the courtesy of Adjutant General Sea- l
mans of the National Guard the prison
Lad been loaned a ("ruling gun, which
had been tested and found to be in good I
working order.
The Gegenestrom system of sajt water I
bathing is found to meet all requirements I
the total cost of its establishment helng
$1098 10. From the warden's report it is
also seen that the breaking of the main
shaft in the jute mill has occasioned lit
tle delay in the manufacture of bags, as
the convicts were set to work sewing
burlap to complete the 13,500 sacks for
which orders were on file at the time
of the accident.
James Cunningham, a convict, was ox
amined by the Lunacy Commission
found insane and sent to Agnews Asy
lum on September â "."">.
The report of Expert L. Wad ham
showed the books of the prison to be in
perfect condition, the total available
funds being $414. 90. In the vault and
in bank are amounts credited to inmates
amounting to $3716 55.
In the report of two boiler Inspectors
It is asserted that the boilers of all ..he
engines are generally in better condition
than when Inspected previously. Several
suggestions were made as regards min
imizing the corrosion due to the vegetable
acids ln water.
The following was Warden Agulrre's
grain bag and raw jute report:
Grain Carried over on orders from
last year, 838,000; sold since January 1
1599, 6,538,824; shipped since same date
7.204,824; sold, awaiting orders for ship
ment. 172,000; on hand, manufactured and
ready for shipment, 84,500; to be manufac

15, 1900; contracted for to be shipped from
Calcutta in .November or December 7000

FORMER SOLDIER
KILLED BY A TRAIN
Harry Biggins of Battery A Horri
bly Mangled at Los
Banos.
LOS BANOS. Oct. 14.â At 8 o'clock this
morning a young man was run over by a
freight train In Los Banos yards. His
right leg was cut off just above the knee
and the left leg crushed near the ankle.
He was taken to the Los Banos Hospital
and placed in charge of Dr. C. F. Wade of
Los Banos and Dr. Dowle of Newman.
He began to sink rapidly and died at 8:30
o'clock. He was unable to give partic
ulars, but on his person was found a
letter written by a young lady In San
Francisco, mailed at 6 a. m. October 11,
addressed to Harry Emmett Biggins, gen
eral delivery, Fresno, Cal., and received
at the latter place at 6:30 p. m. the same
day.
He had on soldier's clothes. On his
shirt was "1 G 5." He wore a soldier
hat, and on It in lead pencil was "H. 8.,"
which corresponds with the letter address.
His front teeth were gold-capped and he
had, the appearance of a man about 25
years of age. â¢
Biggins was formerly a member of Bat
tery A, Third Artillery. The ladies of the
Red Cross and the employment committee
speak very well of the young man.

LIKES UNCLE SAM'S SEAMEN
GENERAL HARRISON TALKS TO
THE EMPEROR.
2__-President of the United States
Warmly Received by the Mem
bers of the Royal Family
at Berlin.
Copyrighted, 1899, by thÂ« Associated Press,
BERLIN, Oct M.-The papers have
many articles regarding the Samoan ques
tion, reiterating the statement as to a
-partition. A leading Foreign Office official,
referring to the matter, said:
"All these statements are mere guess
â work and without foundation in fact. The
powers are negotiating with a view of
eliminating the difficulty and there is lit
tle likelihood of any further trouble be
tween them, as a settlement satisfactory
to all concerned probably will be reached.
Bo far as the damage question goes, an
agreement has already been reached be
tween Germany and Great Britain and the
united States la not opposed on principle
to the same idea of settlement."
On the same authority the Associated
Press learns that a strong wish is felt at
fit. Petersburg that the principal repre
sentatives of the powers participating in
tho peace conference at The Hague which
are willing to sign the agreements
reached there should proceed to the cap
ital of The Netherlands and affix their
â formal signatures in that city. Italy and
Austria have already done so, and Ger
many will soon join them after the re
moval of certain formal obstacles. United
States Embassador White says he is still
awaiting instructions from Washington
regarding the matter.
The visit of General and Mrs. Harrison
lias created an excellent impression, the
newspapers commenting pleasantly and in
a tone of hearty hospitality. The Lokal
Anzeiger says:
"General Harrison will take home a fa
vorable impression of Germany and Em
peror William. Let us hope that he will
utilize his visit for the purpose of im
proving the relations between the two
countries. With his influence and the es
teem In which he is held it ought not to
be difficult for him to destroy many er
roneous opinions held by his countrymen
regarding Germany."
To a fellow guest at the court fete on
Monday in honor of Queen Wilhelmina
of the Netherlands General Harrison
paid:
"Emperor William is most agreeable in
conversation and surprisingly well in
formed regarding men and things in the
United States. He . poke at length and
vlth the greatest interest of the United
States navy and expressed his admiration
of the patriotism and far-sightedness of
American public men and of the action
of Congress in so quickly and at such a
sacrifice creating so powerful and effi
cient a navy. The Emperor said that af
ter a thorough study of the naval oper
ations during the war between the
United States and Spain he had formed
the highest opinion of the businesslike
efficiency of the officers and men of the
American navy, remarking that It was a
splendid feature of American character
to fairly worship the nation's hero. His
Majesty spoke in English and put many
offhand Questions as to men and mat
ters."
The Empress also showed the greatest
attention to Mrs. Harrison, â¦ with whom
she conversed In English. Queen Wil
helmina spoke repeatedly during the fete
to General and Mrs. Harrison.
The visit of the Dutch monarch has
puzzled the entire press. The fact that
the German Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Count yon Bulow, hurried back from his
vacation and had several long private
conversations with her, subsequently re
ceiving one of the highest Dutch decora
tions, has given rise to the supposition
that her visit had something to do with
politics.
The socialist convention in Hanover
has resolved to move in the Reichstag
next month for the abolition of tie lese

The Socialist members of the Reichstag
have collected striking material in sup
port of the motion.

ized a lottery, which it is expected will
produce 1,500,000 marks, to be applied in
embellishing the Siebengebirge of the

to Coblenz. Three hundred thousand tick
ets will be offered, of which 15.000 will
draw prizes, the highest being 125,000
marks.

and Montanas.

â¢
x_^x AKL'AND, Oct. 14.â For once the
if prophecy Oct. the weather fore
prophecy of the weather fore
-11 JJ caster was fulfilled, and in spite
x^*/ of the rains and the dark black
clouds that hung over Oakland
till midnight all gave way to the "clear
but sharp" condition that the weather
man promised this city for to-day.
The Kansas and Montana regiments,
usually accustomed at this time of year
to blizzards and similar fearful things,
march' through the streets escorted by
California troops and veterans in as beau
tiful sunshiny weather as Kansas or Mon
tana can produce at their best. Oakland's
reception to the volunteers was a com
plete success, and as far as possible the
boys were repaid for the exertions they
made to please Oakland in a sham battle
before they went to the Philippines.
As they marched through the streets to
day they presented a different appear-
ance. The Montana boys, who were wildly
cheered in this city over a year ago,
seemed to be many years older as they
passed by this morning. Since their ab
sence from Oakland the boys have on
many occasions tasted of the bitterness
of real war, and although their colonel
apologized for the absence of many of
the regiment, who had not been able to
cross the bay, there were other gaps in
the ranks for which the colonel offered
no apology.
As the parade passed along the streets
the fact was noticed and freely com
mented on that there was not the usual
amount of cheering, yelling, horn-tooting
and flag-waving that has characterized
similai occasions here and elsewhere. The
Oakland boy forgot the final command of
Grand Marshal Mitchell and left his horn
at home. Hut what was lacking on the
street was atoned for In the big Exposi
tion building. Nobody pretended that the
debt Oakland is under to the volunteers
who went to the Philippines was wiped
out by all that was done for them to-day.
All the speakers emphasized the fact that
the part they bore in upholding national
honor can never be repaid by anything
so material as receptions, but so far aa
generosity can liquidate such an obliga
tion Oakland did it to the fullest extent.
In the Tabernacle the result of the
labors of a hundred ladies was scattered
over thousands of feet of tables, and the
regiments, with appetites sharpened by
the clear air and long march, needed no
second invitation to partake of the ban
quet. On no occasion has such a dis
tinguished military affair taken place in
this city. In the parade were General
Shaffer and his staff and General Funston
and his wife, while all the civic digni
taries were either in carriages or riding
gayly decked horses. Occasionally the
many distinguished persons along the line
of march were treated to a cheer, but
from the start it was very evident that
the guests of the day were General Fun-
Ston and the East Oakland lady he mar
ried a year ago. More than passing inter
est is felt in the general and his wife. A
few evenings ago at one of the meetings of
the reception committee ex-Mayor Thomas
stated that there were at least six en
gagements to be announced between Kan
sas officers and Oakland girls. Everybody
is wondering what surprises the engage
ments may prove.
In the intervals to-day between the ban
quet and the evening exercises the volun
teers owned the city, much to the dis
comfiture of the Oakland youth, who was
very much de trop with the fair sex.
Nothing but uniforms received the pretty
bouquets which were so freely distributed
and general as was the reception there
was a certain dudish element that un
doubtedly was glad when the soldier boys
had returned to their lonely camps at the
Presidio.
, The carriage of General Funston was
nearly filled with flowers by the school
children as he passed the thousands of
youngsters gathered at Fourteenth and
Washington streets, and while every car
riage was generously treated none re
ceived so much attention as the coupe in
which rode the Kansas general. The stal
wart body of mounted aids under the
command of John W. Mitchell was ad
mired almost as much as the volunteers.
All were on lively horses and under the
protection of the platoon of police which
marched ahead of them none of the
mounted aides-de-camp came to grief.
Between the companies of volunteers
marched a little band of veterans, which
each year grows smaller. This company
of reserves, under the command of C. K.
King, was organized in the spring of last
year and although they offered their ser
vices to the Government Mr. McKlnley
gratefully acknowledged the offer, but
was forced to disappoint their ambitions.
On arrival at the Tabernacle a full hour
old-fogvism and favoritism. Baron yon
Windheim, Chief of the Berlin police, will
soon start on a circular tour of London,
New York and Chicago to study their de
tective systems.
A case that has been pending in Bava
ria for 300 years has just been decided in
the highest court at Munich. The ques
tion under litigation was the title to a
forest claimed by Baron yon Thumfen,
from the village of Burgslnn. The village
won and the Baron must pay the costs.
A duel was fought this week at Stettin
between Lieutenant yon Forst of the
Thirty-eighth Artillery and Captain Adel
bert Montt of Chile, who had permission
from the Kaiser to study the new artil
lery tactics With the Thirty-eighth Regi
ment. Lieutenant yon Forst was mor
tally wounded ln the neck and the
Chilean officer has been expected to re
turn home.
The naval budget has been completed.
It calls for 05.500,000 marks for vessels in
process of construction. The list shows
that thirty-seven vessels are now being
built, of which eight are battleships and
eight cruisers, the others being torpedo
boats.
The Prussian Minister of the ' Interior
is now considering the question of insur
ance against storms, inundations and
other forces of nature. He has requested
the principal companies to report regard
ing the feasibility of the project.
Emperor William to-day visited the Co
lonial Museum, which is under the man
agement of German-Americans. A num
ber of American- firms are taking steps
to establish iron and steel works. One
establishment is now being erected near
Berlin by the Nilos Tool Works Company
of Hamilton, Ohio. Another company is
starting a machine shop at Dusseldorf.
Several pamphlets have appeared this
week regarding the unsatisfactory com
mercial relations between Germany and
the United States. One, by Paul Rache,
is approvingly commented upon in the
Frankfurter Zeitung. Another, by Wal
ter Borgius, much more definite in tone,
is daily quoted. Both condemn the al
leged vexatious manner in which the
tariff is being applied in the United
States to German goods. The Cologne
Gazette and other influential papers af
firm the truth of the principal statements
of the writers and urge the Government
to hasten steps to mend matters.
The Agrarian papers publish a series
of strong articles demanding that the
Government should protect and promote
the fruit interests of the empire by keep
ing out all foreign fruit, especially Amer
ican fruit. -..:..
THE SAN FB AN CISCO CALL, SUNDAY. OCTOBER 15. 1899.
MRS. FRED FUNSTON.
From Her Latest Photo.
was spent at the tables by the. guests
from Montana and Kansas, 'me ladles of
the Red Cross, with exquisite grace, com
pleted the task they had undertaken by
waiting on the boys and convincing them
that nowhere, except perhaps in their
home place, can any city extend a warmer
welcome to volunteers than Oakland.
While there was plenty left upon the
tables the two thousand appetites were
satisfied and at the call of a bugle Chair
man P. M. Fisher of the entertainment
committee and president of the day, wel
comed the guests. In a few words he
introduced Mayor Snow, who on behalf of
the city guaranteed the boys all the free
dom during their visit that the laws of
the country and the forbearance of in
dividuals would permit. In his speech the
Mayor said:
"You have advanced our flag, gallant
boys of Montana and Kansas, until the
center of the United States is no longer
your State but California. If when you
return to the East you find the old home
stead crowded come and live with us. \'ou
have made us better men by your pa
triotic example in war. You can make us
better citizens by living with us and help
ing us to solve the problems of peace."
The Mayor was succeeded by ex-Mayor
W. R. Thomas, who presided over the
pleasant ceremonies attending the last
visit of the Montana volunteers.
"On your last visit you fought for our
diversion a sham battle," said Captain
Thomas, "but the Kansas troops were
more in earnest even at that time, for
their gallant colonel came over to our city
and there was no sham battle about the
advances he made. Nor did he capitulate
until he had captured. Let me warn you
that you are a long distance from home
and as our Oakland lady scouts are on
duty more of you may be captured as
was Colonel Funston."
The little general from Kansas was re
ferred to by Chairman Fisher and in
stantly nothing could be heard from
thousands of voices but "Funston! Fun
ston! Funston!" He was introduced by
the chairman as a man brave enough to
"swim a stream, climb a mountain in the
face of a gun, and yet timid enough when
he came to Oakland to surrender to one
of her fairest citizens."
When General Funston appeared there
were cries for his wife and Miss Mollie
Connors was appointed a committee of
one to escort the lady to the platform.
The general apologized for not having
a speech ready. He would not talk on the
issues of the war, he said, but would con
fine himself to sincerely thanking the peo
ple of Oakland for the reception tendered
his old regiment, the Twentieth Kansas.
The general paid a high compliment to
the Montana regiment and told how the
Twentieth Kansas and the Third Artil
lery had fought from Manila on the 4th
of March until side by side they entered
Malolos. â â â "-. '->*'â¢
"Such men as these," said the general,
"if given an opportunity, can crush Ag
uinaldo's little rebellion, and there are
men there new who will crush It, and I
expect that about March or April there
will be a settlement of the Philippine
question.
"There ha* been a great deal of talk
about mismanagement of the campaign.
"Those who are saying most know the
least. I want to say that there never
was an army better housed, better fed,
better equipped, better disciplined than
that army which Is now fighting under
the flag in the Philippines. The hospital
service 's so good that within three
hours, especially if on the line of the rail
road, do not elapse before a wounded
man is receiving the attention of sur
geons. Out of 1500 wounded limbs there
was not one single case of primitive am
putation and there was but three cases
of secondary amputation. In the Civil
War, out of 1500 cases there were 500
who lost their limbs. *"
"The war, I think, will end about
April. The light artillery now in the field
do not have to drag their guns through
the rice fields. There Is now an ample
transport service.
"I hope nb man will allow himself to
become a professional 'old soldier. I
hope that he will not run for office, but
go to tho old business which he left
when he entered the war and thus show
that there is no truth in the saying, 'Oh,
he's been a year and a half in the army
and he's no good.' (Cheers.)
"I am proud to say that of the 1000
men of the Kansas regiment who went to
Hongkong with their pockets full of
money after a stay of seven days in a
place which was full of saloons not one
of them was seen drunk upon the
streets." (Cheers.) \ â 
After the cheering following General
Funston's remarks had suusided there
were loud demands for a speech {rom his
wife. Chairman Fisher said It was very
ungallant of thousands of soldiers to de
mand a speech from a woman, but never
theless Mrs. Funston gratified the de
mand.
"I am thankful," she said, "to the peo
ple of this city for the honor they have
conferred upon me and the kindness tney
have shown me. I would be glad to stay
here in Oakland and pass the time here
with my husband. At present that is the
only thing I sincerely wish for. But I
cannot say where my time shall oe
spent."
Chaplain Stull was charged with the
duty of representing Colonel Kessler of
the Montana regiment, who was unavoid
ably kept in San Francisco. He corrob
orated General Funston's statement that
he had never made a speech. "But," said
the I chaplain, "I once heard the general
say something* more forcible and effective
than all the speeches I ever heard in my
life. He cried 'Forward,' and for the re
sult of that one word consult the history
that shall be written in coming years of
the war ln the Philippines."
General Shafter was introduced and
asked to add to the words of welcome.
"It will be a source of gratification to
you as years roll by," said the general,
"that, although you were entitled to your
discharge by reason of your time of serv
ice having expired, you remained in the
ranks because your country needed you.
/Mameda <?o_pty fleu/5
I It Is said that republics are not grateful,
! but from the nature of the reception ten
: dered you I am sure you will be satisfied
that if republics are ungrateful, the peo
ple of this republic are not. I want to
: bid you good-by, and hope that you may
never be asked again to go to war. But
â  I know that if you are you will do your
duty bravely and fearlessly as you have

CAN EXIST
MINUS BRAIN
OAKLAND, Oct. li.-Dr. J. W. Wythe,
one of the best-known medical men
and histological professors on the
coast, has published a statement
that the brain is not such an im
portant organ as is commonly supposed.
The statement is as follows:
"In the papers of recent date was pub
lished an account of the case of Professor
Riehl, whose brain was traversed by a
pistol shot on September 9. Since that
time the surgeon attending him estimates
that 'fully one-fourth of the brain has
exuded, from the wound made In his skull.
Your correspondent indulges in consid
erable speculation respecting his future
mental condition, evidently regarding the
case as unique. The doctor declares that
he has found no mention in medical and
surgical literature of a parallel case.
"Considerable acquaintance with sur
gical literature leads me to a different
opinion. In my book entitled 'The
Physiology of the Soul' I have collected
eighty-one such casesâ seventy-two of
these are from the Pennsylvania Hospital
reportsâ in which there was extensive loss
of brain substance with little or no dis
turbance or aberration of mind. At the
â¢session of the California State Medical
Society in San Francisco, 18S7, one of the
members exhibited the skull of a man
who had been tomahawked and scalped
by the Indians In 1851. The skull had a
jagged hole in it about four by three
inches wide. Nearly the entire middle
lobe of tie cerebrum had rotted away, yet
the .man for ten years showed no bodily
or mental signs of his Injury and was re
garded as a miner of considerable intelli-
gence.
"The subject Is hardly suitable for a
newspaper article, as It would require
too much space, or a large number of
cases and facts might be gathered show
ing that the common opinion that the
brain Is the special organ of mind Is er
roneous. Its sensory-motor function is
work enough for the brain. The common
opinion is made to uphold the present
mode of philosophy called monism, while
It confirms a rational dualism of the real
existence of both body and soul.
"J. H. WYTHE. M. D."

KILLED BY A
LIVE WIRE AT
LIVERMORE
Charles Bennett the
Latest Victim.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 14.
Charles Bennett, aged about 22 years,
and for some time past in the employ of
the Livermore Water and Power Com
pany, was electrocuted on a street at
Livermore last night, another victim of
the live wire.
Bennett was making the rounds of the
electric light service with James Shan,
another employe, and they were about to
make some repairs on one of the arc
lamps. Shan had climbed the pole and
was lowering the lamp to the ground.
Bennett, in the meantime, was stationed
at the base of the pole, with one hand
on the metal reel handle, and as the
lamp descended he took hold of it with
his other hand, completing the circuit.
The electric current passed through his
body and he was instantly killed. His
body fell across the handle of the reel,
and with great difficulty and at a great
risk to himself Shan succeeded in mov
ing the body away. Shan also received a
shock, but was not seriously injured.
The deceased was a native of this State.
He was the son of George Bennett and
was held in high esteem by the entire
community.
Coroner Mehrmann was advised of the
death this morning and has ordered the
inquest to be held next Monday morn
ing. '
LAING STRIKES
BACK AT HIS WIFE
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 14.
A decidedly spicy answer and cross
complaint was filed late this afternoon in
the sensational divorce suit of Isabella
Turnbull Laing against Peter Miller
Laing, brought for the second time with
in the past three months.
Mrs. Laing's complaint is prolific in al
legations of Infidelity and general viola
tions of the marital vows, even going so
far as to implicate the name of one of her
nearest relatives, a Jemima Laing, and
naming numerous times and divers places
and escapades that will no doubht prove
decidedly interesting when the case
comes up for trial.
On the other hand, the husband's an
swer and cross-complaint contains alle
gations none the less sensational than
those made by the plaintiff wife. He not
only charges Mrs. Laing with various
acts of cruelty, but declares that she, too.
was guilty of the grossest infidelity. Tne
cross-complaint names a Robert Hill of
San Francisco as co-respondent, and re
cites an incident in which a criminal
operation is alleged to have been per
formed by Mme. Jacques, for whom the
local police authorities have been search
ing high and low for many months.
Mr. Laing asks that the court give him
a decree of divorce, that his wife take
nothing and that his real estate interests
be left undisturbed.

The secretary of the Oakland Golf Club
has received a dispatch from Willie An
derson of the Baltusrol Golf Club of New
York In which the golfer states that he
starts next Tuesday evening for Califor
nia, and will be here in ten days to take
up his duties as coach of the Oakland
Club. Willie Anderson was born in North
Berwick, Scotland, where he and David
Stephenson, the coach of the San Fran
cisco Golf Club, were boys at school to
gether. He began to play golf at a very
early age and soon displayed great skill.
When 12 years of age he left North Ber
wick and about four years later came to
the United States. On September 17, 1597,
he was second in the open championship
of the United States at Chicago, 111., with
a score of 163, the champion's score being
162. On June 17 and 18 of last year he was
third ln the open championship, played on
the links of the Myopia Hunt Club, F.
Herd winning the championship and Alex
ander Smith being second. In the United
States championship meeting of 1899, ln
which Willie Smith gained flrst place with
a score of 815 for 72 holes, three competi

score was 327. David Stephenson is of the
opinion that the North Berwick links, on
which he and his former schoolmate, who
Is now about 20 years old, learned the
royal and ancient game, are the flnest ln
Scotland and therefore In the world. The
Oaklanders are quite satis-fled that thÂ©
club ha."Â» secured the services of a flrst
class golfer and expert professional
player. ______________

The Hay Market.
â
The circular of Scott _ Mftgner Bays:
"Arrivals of Hay during this week have been
lighter than for some time, being 3583 tons.
The lessened arrivals have not changed the
torn of the market. Prices are practically un
changed. Many of the large consumers are
out of the market for the time being. Sales
on consignment have continued rather slow.
Efforts have been made to sustain prevailing
prices end hold the market steady. It Is gen
erally expected that the present rain will do
considerable damage to Hay that is still out.
What effect these offerings may have on the
market when they arrive will be determined
later.
'COMPRESSED HAYâ Arrivals have been
fairly active and the quality of the offerings
has "been mainly of good grades. Sales have
been satisfactory.
"ALFALFA HAYâ Arrivals of this Hay have
continued heavy. There is â  decidedly easier
feeling noted everywhere on Alfalfa, Con
signments have not found ready sale, and the
market generally drags. The demand appears
to be considerably less than the offerings."
Barley and Oats.
The circular of George Morrow _ Co. says:
"BARLEYâ Receipts for the week, 94,143 ctls.
The Barley market la In rather a peculiar con
dition. As a rule a good, heavy rain has an
Immediate and depressing effect upon the j
market, but to-day' b heavy rain is paid no
heed to. This would not be the case if there j
were not a quiet little Call Board deal on in i
Leivmber Barley, which, In spite of receipts
ami weather, seems fully able to hold Its own.
All offerings of bright feed Barley, which |
will pass the Inspector, are snapped up for j
piling purposes and future delivery on Decem- ]
ber tracts. This all tends to give a healthy
tone to tho local spot market, although apart
from the Call Board .and there Is not much
Inquiry for spot Barley of any kind. Shippers
will take heavy bright Barley at fair figures,
but as a rule sellers have to meet their views.
Brewers are at last in the market for de
sirable lots and will pay good prices for se
lected offerings. The local demand from the
feed mills is comparatively light, as cheap
oats are being given a slight preference.
"OATSâ Receipts for the week. 23.332 ctls.
The Oregon crop has at last commenced to
move and thiÃ week that State gives us 4000
ctls. These receipts are but a foretaste of
what we may expect In the way of off-color
oats from that section. Doubtless their home
market Is better than this, but it Is limited,
and sooner or later the bulk of their poor Oats
must come to this port- We doubt very' much
if current prices will induce holders in the
North to part with their choice, bright and
undamaged Oats.
"The present heavy and quite general rain
will unquestionably stimulate the demand for
Bed and Black Oats for seed purposes, and
we know of no reason why they should not
advance In price soon."

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 14.â The day's stock mar
ket reflected nothing more than a contest of
professional operators and those not of very
large caliber. There were small buying orders
at the opening for London account on rumors
of a reverse for the Boers at the hands of the
British ln Natal, which seemed to help prices
to move upwards. The bear campaign against
Brooklyn Transit was successfully prosecuted
end the stock was at one time forced 2% under
last night. Metropolitan and Manhattan seemed
to sympathize, but recovered their decline with
the final rally of 1% In Brooklyn Transit. Pull
man has added three more points to Its price,
end Great Northern preferred 3%. Gains were
pretty generally wiped out after the publica
tion of the bank statement, but covering by
the bears brought some prices a fraction above
last night again. The decrease ot over a mil
lion In cash reserves of the banks was a dis
appointment as experts had figured on an In
crease of about that much. Had it not been
for a larger loan contraction than had been
looked for the surplus reserves, would have
been wiped out. Extra disbursements by the
Government during the week, on account of
the deficit of the Postofflce Department and
on account of pensions, had offset tbe drain
on account of revenue payments so that
the banks have lost nothing to the
sub-treasury on routine operation. This
is not expected to continue this week and not
much confidence Is felt that the Government
Interest to be paid on Monday in anticipation
of Its maturity will avail to offset the drain
Into the sub-treasury on account of the sur
plus of revenues. Neither Is there any hope
of duplicating this week's receipts of gold,
which amounted to rather over $3,000,000, with
foreign gold, a small amount from Cuba and
from Kan Francisco. The outlook Is for fur
ther depletion of bank cash and additional
contraction of loans.
The public has kept aloof from Wall street
during the week and the professional trading
element has fretted and fumed over the dull
'jteaa of trade and their Inability to cause any
movement of prices sufficient to take profits
for a turn. It Is well recognized that specu
lative liquidation. Is all that has afforded such
relaxation in the money rate as has occurred
and a renewal of the money stringency would
be likely to quickly follow any speculative
activity. The state of war which has de
veloped between England and the South Afri
can republic was of very little effect and seems
to have been so thoroughly discounted that
the markets of the whole world have adjusted
themselves to the conditions. There was a re
covery ln prices when the announcement was
made that the Treasury Department had de
cided to pay in advance interest for the whole
fiscal year on Government bonds, but a fur
ther study of the plan brought conviction that
It offered no assurance of actual ease of money
: such as Wall street wants for a speculative
campaign. The very merit of the plan from
the standpoint of Its projector, that Is. that if
Insures a general distribution of the relief
through the money market centers -if the whole
country, militates against it from Wall street's
standpoint. .
The money markets of the rest of the coun
try have had money to lend In New York thus
Mr, when the call loan rate soared to 20 and
30 and 40 per cent. A large part of the total
customs and internal revenue payments are
made through New York banks and the direct
drain thus made upon their resources will
he only Indifferently relieved by the anticipated
interest payments at other points in the coun
try. Besides the large amounts of govern
ments held elsewhere than in New York, It
is believed that some very large hollers In
New York Itself will not be disposed to give
up the required rebate of Government Interests
and take the risk of replacing the money at
advantage. This is notably true of savings
banks, which are restricted to high grade
bonds for Investment, which offer only a low
return. The insurance companies and trust
companies are also unlikely to avail them
selves of the privilege. If the general con
dition of the money market in the country at
large were as stringent as In New York doubt
less the proffered relief would be more generally
[taken advantage of. The. Treasury Depart
ment, however, has given It to be understood
that It is not disposed to take special meas
ures for relieving the peculiar distress in stock
market circles, so long as money is to he had
for commercial purposes at 6 per cent. Bank
ers In New York view the condition with
equanimity. They are satisfied to see a good,
stiff money rate based on healthy business
activity and are not sorry to be able to dis
! criminate against the more doubtful class of
i securities and thus check unsound speculative
Inflation. Wl-h the activity and prosperity
; In all lines of business It Is not feared that real
values will suffer on account of the discrimi
nation ln extending credits.
The course of the foreign exchanges makes
ft evident that relaxation of the money rate
j here would be followed by an outgo of gold.
Credits have been over-extended In the active
industrial expansion ln Russia and Germany,
and. judging from the week's developments
iln that country. Initial. The trade i 3 active

vall it" oft the source to which London has
i looked for regular replenishment of Its gold
supply. With a universal scramble among the
great credit Institutions of the world toward
: recuperation of reserves, no point of relief from
i high money rates Is dlscernable.
The tendency of prices of bonds has been
uniformly downward. Business has been
fairly active and well distributed.

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â Financier says:
The banks of New York were able last week to
hold a small sum to surplus reserves, but this
result was made possible only through a con
traction of loans and deposits. There was a
decrease of 682,000 in loans and of $6,212,-
600 In deposits. The contraction In the
latter Item lessened reserve requirements
about $1,600,000, and this more than coun
terbalanced the loss of $1,000,000 ln cash.
thus accounting for the gain of $534,150
In surplus. The statement is considered to be
fairly satisfactory, but If Its totals are correct
the receipts of gold from Europe and the Pa
cific Coast have not been sufficient to meet
losses to the interior and to the Treasury. As
there is no diminution in the demand for money
ln the interior, the outlook for a further acces
sion of cash at this center is not as bright as
was the case during the previous week, and
the inference that the familiar expedient of
meeting the situation by liquidating loans Is
not at an end. Still it is not to be overlooked
In this connection that the anticipation of
Treasury Interest may afford some relief, but
not enough to materially alter the existing sit
uation. The loans and deposits of the banks
are now at the lowest points of the whole year.
A remarkable feature of the case Is that time
money and commecrlal loans do not reflect the
existing stringency here, rates holding only a
little above the average, but the action of In
terior banks which are steady buyers of paper
is accountable for this. The next two or three
weeks will go far toward determining the aver
age rate for money over a considerable time,
as the crop season Is ending; but the fact that
prices are universally higher and business Is
more activeâ two factors necessitating a larger
volume of currency at all pointsâ sets the usual
calculation as to the amount of possible relief
through a return flow of money at naught.
During the week domestic exchange at Impor
tant cities dropped from 10 to 25 cents, a tan
gible Illustration that the demand for funds Is
not at an end.m^a^a^a^a^a^a^a^a^a^a^Mammmm

CHICAGO, Oct. Wheat opened at a shade
of firmness following a slight advance at Liv
erpool and smaller Northwest receipts, but
after a slight flurry during the Initial trading

that the ,market threatened to get below puts,
but buying against those privileges caused a
fractional upturn during the last ten minutes.

declined slowly t0, 72c, and closed with buyers
at 72@72%c. Chicago received 760 cars, three of

If your sickness is like hers,
Mrs. Jacobs' story will interest you.
"I was very sick Indeed " writes Mrs.
Mollie Jacobs, of Felton, Kent Co., Del-
aware, ' and our family doctor said I had
consumption. I thought I must die soon
for I felt so awful bad. Had a bad cough,
i-pit blood, was very short of breath, had
pains in my chest and right lung, and also
had dyspepsia. Before I took your 'Golden
Medical Discovery ' and ' Pleasant Pellets '
I was so weak I could not sweep a room,
and now I can do a small washing, and I
feel like a new person. I believe that the
Lord and your medicine have saved my
life. I was sick over two years. I took 13
bottles of the 'Golden Medical Discovery,'
and four vial* of Dr. Pierces Pellets."

CONVENTION WELL BE HELD
NEXT WEEK
Preparations for the Defense of the
Coast Trade Will Be Com
pleted Within the Next
Two Weeks.
Sacramento will be represented by dele
gates to the meeting on the 21st Inst, in
this city, at which a permanent organiza
tion of the Pacific Coast Traffic Associa
tion will be effected. The latest advices
are that in the following cities business
houses have enrolled as indicated: Sacra
mento, 20; Los Angeles, 40; San Diego, 10;
Portland, 40; Seattle, 30; Tacoma, 20. San
Francisco will have between 200 and 250
big business houses on the roll. This is
considered very satisfactory for a start.
The concerns are all wholesalers, jobbers
or manufacturers. According to the basis
provided for representation on the execu
tive committee, that being one delegate
for every ten business houses joining the
association, the meeting in this city will
be quite large. Rating the total roll at
400 at the time for the appointment of
the delegates, although it will really be
larger, there will be forty delegates at
least. The amount of invested capital
that they will represent will be high in
the millions.
A president, secretary, treasurer and
executive committee and perhaps other
officers will be elected for the permanent
association. The executive committee of
the temporary association will submit a
report concerning what has been accom
plished up to date. The various lines of
business in Kan Francisco will probably
be represented at the St. Louis meeting
of the Interstate Commerce Commission
about as follows: Hardware and metal
trade, W. R. Wheeler of Holbrook, Mer
rill & Stetson; A. C. Rulofson of Baker
_ Hamilton; Charles F. Tay of the George
H. Tay Company; A. L. Scott of Miller,
Sloss & Scott. Probably Bruce Hayden
of the New York house of Dunham, Car
rigan & Hayden Company will also at
tend. Groceries will be represented by
H. D. Loveland, chairman of the execu
tive committee of the temporary organi
zation of the Pacific Coast Traffic Asso
ciation, and also by witnesses whom it I
may be considered advisable to summon, i
The drug trade will be represented by
either L. Guggenheim or Henry Michaels,
president of the Langley & Michaels Com.
pany; the paper trade by Arthur Towne
or L. Bonestell. The cities of Tacoma,
Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles and San
Diego may also send representatives of !
their various interests to St. Louis, so i
that the coast delegation will be of fair |
size.
NATIONAL GUARD NOTES.
Why a Member of the Governor's
Staff Did Not Appear for
Target Practice.
There is to be an election for lieutenant
colonel and three majors of the Seventh
Infantry Regiment. Captain R. V. Dodge
of Company B of San Diego is the lead
ing candidate for the lieutenant colonelcy.
Los Angeles has petitioned for a divl
eion of the Naval Militia, and It is prob
able that it will secure it.
The target practice of the field and staff
officers of the Naval Militia will shortly
be held under the supervision of Lieuten
ant W. F. Burke.
Last Tuesday night the men of the Sec
ond Division had a drill on the Marlon

tem of signaling with flags. They also
devoted time to reading the flash light
signals sent by the men on the lowa. Not
having a light the men of the militia
could not respond.

Colonel Chadbourne, paymaster on the
staff of the commander in chief, did not
take part In the recent target practice.
His friends explain his absence from the
targets on the ground that he had mis
laid his sword, and say that he intended,
in case he did not make a record with a
pistol, to punch the target full of holes
with the point of his sword. -
WANTED TO BE HANGED.
Robert L. Hunt Pleads Guilty to
Murder â Joseph Fagan
Sentenced.
Murderer Robert L. Hunt, who shot and
killed George Elliott and E. R. Knippen
berg In a saloon c-n Steuart street on
September 9 last, was before Judge Law
lor yesterday for the setting of the date
of his trial. Hunt on entering the court
advanced to the bar and said: "I'm
guilty, all right. I shot George Elliott
and I want to plead guilty and be hanged
right away. I don't want an attorney."
Judge La%vlor, appreciating the condi
tion of the murderer's mind, refused to
accept the plea of guilty. He ordered the
case continued for one week and if In the
meantime Hunt fails to secure the ser
vice of an attorney the court will ap
point counsel to represent him during the
trial. There appears to be no doubt as
to Hunt's insanity and In all probability
he will be sent to some Institution for
treatment and not to the gallows.
Joseph Pagan, who robbed J. A. Groves
of $3 last July, was sentenced to twenty
years ln San Quentln by Judge Dunne
yesterday morning. Four prior convic
tions stood against the convict, who has
grown gray behind prison walls, and un
less pardoned he will spend his last days
In the penitentiary.

gthe green banks of the river
Yaqui is a grave baked and parched
by tiie pitiless Mexican sun that
flickers mockingly over the rough
beard that marks he spot.
Crimson letters traced in warm
lifebloed Ftracrgie over this headstone.
Alfredo and Lola are the two names that
show darkly red above a month-old date.
In the town of Hermosillo they are say

He together in death. There is wailing in
the City of Mexico: there is weeping In
the Mexican colony In San Cisco. The
story of Alfredo Padllla and .'la Alvarez
is told ar.d retold, punctuated with sighs
and vain regrets.
It Is a strango tale this, a story that
begins in the foothills of the State of Bo
nora. thence to convent walls ln San
Francisco, finally to death where rolls
the Yaqul F.lvcr. T.lke a romance of long:
agr>, like a tragedy of the yesteryears. is
this story of the short life and sudden
death of Lieutenant Padilla and Lola Al-
These two, who sleep the sleep that
knows no waking, lived In neighboring
houses in the city of rmo 110 Lola
and Alfredo were sweethearts* even in
their dolly and tin soldier days. They
played juvenile imus and Thiebe over
their garden walls while their nurses
dawdled drowsily with their linen work.
One day Lola poked her head through
the garden wal! and called for "Al
fredito." His nurse gave her the first
prick of the many heart-stabs that she
was doomed to suffer. Alfredo had been
sent to military school. Alfredo 'was a
bit- boy now. 10 years old, and must learn
the, art of war; Alfredo had goneâ gone
without an "adios" or a "iii ta manana"
to Lolita".
Lolita cried the brightness out of her
eyes for a week. Then she forgot all
about Alfredo, for a little orphan cousin
of her own age came to the house of Al
varez and tilled Alfredo's place in the
heart of Lolita. Gabriella and Lola
loved each other with more than. cousinly
Ten years ago they were sent to the
convent of Notre Dame in tills city. They
were just 'â â¢, but they suffered from home
sickness that clutches alike at the art
strings of youth or age. The shy little
Mexican girl- knew not the language of
the other children, nor understood their
A year passed at Notre Dame, Lola and
Gabriella learning to chatter the language
of the "Gringitas" ar.d to still their long
ings for Mexico. Then Senor Alvarez
cam.- and took them back to Hermosillo.
Other children played in the garden where
Alfredo and Lolita had stirred their mud
pies. The Padilias had moved to the City
Gabrieila and Lola were sent back tO
the convent, where they stayed nine
years, going to Hermosillo only for their
vacations. At 17 they were both beauti
ful girls of the dusky type that blossoms
under southern skies. Gabriella was pe
tite and plump, with soft brown eyes and
creamy skin. Lola was :_ taller, built on
the nobler plan of the men of moun
tainous Sonora; she had little of the lazi
ness of her countrywomen. Northern
wind and fog had toned native indolence.
Her cheeks were like CastilUan roses and
determined flashes in her black eyes be
lled tho half-closed lids.
One Sunday morning Lola and Gabriella
went with friends to th* little Catholic
church where their countrymen worship.
A ray of sunlight fell on Lola, fervently
praying to the Holy Mother; a ray of
sunlight that caught a young man's eyeÂ«
and piloted them to the kneeling girl.
Alfredo Podilla looked long at Lola and
wondered where he had seen her. it was
not his first visit to San Francisco, and
he had met the daughters of many of
the Mexicans. But this girl seemed to
belong to an earlier period of his life, to

carry his memories back to childhood's
dim recollections.
Lola, having finisher" her prayers, rose
and threw back her head after a manner
all her own. "I. ilita," said th* watching
youth half aloud, and straightway he wu
again playing with her in the garden at
It was easy to arrange for an intro
duction after church. Lola and Alfredo
exchanged laughing memories of other
days and clasped hands with mutual
promises of future friendship. They saw
each other frequently. Mexican doors
swing wide welcome to visitors, sympa
thetic senoras, mother convent girls In a
strange land. Wherever Lola and Ga
briella visited Alfredo could find hospita
ble greeting.
Lolita and Gabriella learned everything
down In the curriculum of the convent of
Notre Pane, from embroidery to astron
omy. They also learned several things
not down In the prospectus. Chief among
which was the American manner of woo
ing, quite unlike the Mexican custom of
playing "bear" to a damsel screened by
Iron bars.
When Alfredo Padilla went back to
the City of Mexico he carried with him
a promise from Lola, from Lolita, who
never broke her word. When Alfredo Pa
dilla called upon Senor Alvarez in Her
mosillo he said "nay" politely but em
phatically. Another suitor had already
been selected for his daughter, a suitor
old but wealthy. Lola laughed the idea
to scorn when she heard It.
Another year of convent life winged by.
Twice during the twelfth month Alfredo,
came to San Francisco. Lola and Ga
briella were no longer allowed outside of
convent walls, save with a sober robed
sister. But Lola saw Alfredo, and saw
him alone. Parents and teachers are
powerless when schoolmates brimful of
white fibs range themselves on the side
of tie- transgressor.
There came' a day of discovery, a
wretched hour of confession to the calm
eyed Mother Superior. A note of Lola's
written to Alfredo carelessly dropped in
t
-^>HEr STR&T I CHED-rie'k S>UPPL\CATiriGi .ARris TO PITYING H^AVE-H.^
the hall hud given the clew. An elaborate
scheme of elopement was ruthlessly
nipped in the bud and Senor Alvarez sum
moned.
He took Lola and Gabriella back to
Hermosillo and forbade his daughter to
ever again write to Alfredo. Alfredo was
now a lieutenant on the staff of General
Hernandez. Lola managed to correspond
with him and to adroitly stave off her
> marriage to the suitor of her father's
choice.
The Yaqul uprising turned her father's
impatience at her refusal Into other chan
nels. He had property in the heart of the
Yaqul country that needed his attention.
In the little town of Ortiz lived a brother
of Senor Alvarez. Thither he went, tak
ing Lola and Gabriella with him, fearful
that in his absence Lola might escape to
her lover in the City of Mexico.
Ortiz is just west of the Yaqul Indian
country, a typical little Mexican town,
with an occasional fandango or cock fight
to vary dull monotony. Yet Lolita sang
for joy at the very thought of going
there. Was not Colonel Juan Hernandez
in the Yaqui country and was not her
Alfredo on the staff of Colonel Hernan

Senor Alvarez was called to Torres on
business, leaving the girls under the
watchful eyes of uncle and aunt. Weeks
passed, Lola suffering exquisite torture,
living in a delirium of joy and fear. Twice
Alfredo came to see her on his way to de
liver important papers and messages.
Now hope, now despair claimed her for
Its own. Thoughts of Alfredo's danger
strangled peace.
A third time Alfredo met his sweetheart.
He was on his way with a report of the
campaign to General Berrizabol, Secre
tary of War. lie had but an hour to spend
with herâ an hour of quaking fear for
Gabriella. who played Sister Anne, an
swirling nay to Lola's "Is my uncle com
ing?"
Two days after Alfredo's departure a
frightened peon mysteriously beckoned
Lola into the garden. A soldier awaited
her. The Yaquis had attacked Lieutenant
Padilla's parly. There was a rumor that
most of the little band had been killed. if
Lieutenant Alfredo was among them, had
tho senorita any commands to give him?
The senorita had but one wishâ to go at
once to Alfredo dead or alive. She did
not listen to his arguments, but flew to
the house, to make ready for the journey.
Gabriella begged and implored in vain.
Then "she. too. bundled a few necessaries
and tiptoed to the stable, saddled the
mules and In the twilight hour the three
rode off.
All the next day and the day after that
they rode, Lola refusing to rest even for
a moment. At length they reached the
spot that rumor had marked as the scene
Â©â (S^@i_g__iÃ
of the conflict. There was not a vestige
of the fray.
"Perhaps" it was a false report," sighed
Gabriella. "Dios sabe!" muttered the sol
dier. Lola, dry-eyed until now, sobbed
out her heart in prayer to "Maria San
tissima." Until sunset they jogged the
steep mountain paths, finding never a
trace of combat.
The morning of the fourth day they
came upon a band of peons. "Twenty
miles distant are 'some dead Mexicans,"
said the stolid peons. Hope still fluttered
fiercely in Lolita's heart. Gabriella, pale
and drooping from fatigue and poor nour
ishment, could scarcely cling to her mule.
Lolita, with bright red spots burnlng\ln
either cheek and wide, staring eyes,
seemed dead to every feeling but the mad
dening desire to find Alfredo. S
Before another sun had set they found
him, found his body lying stiff and cold
while the dying glory of a Mexican _*__-
set bathed the woods in opal splendor.
The Taquis from a secure position in the
mountain steeps had fired upon tbe un
suspecting band. Fearing another detach
ment was following, the Yaquis. small in
number and short of ammunition, had
fled without mutilating their victims.
While the soldier silently dug a grave
and burled his dead comrades Lola tried
to caress into life her lover. From his
appearance he had evidently lived some
time after being wounded. There were
marks down to the river where he had
crawled for water. Life and death had
evld-sntly fought a hard and long battle.
All night Lola whispered the sweet en
dearments of her language into his deaf
ears and kissed the sightless- eyes. At
the flrst streak of dawn the soldier dug
another graveâ this one for the lieutenant,
Lola was calm nowâ a strange unnatural
calmness that frightened Gabriella. "Poor
Gabriella," she said, fondling her cousin.
"Pobreclta Gabriella!" "You will always
love me, chiqulta, will you not? Mi alma,
ml dulce!" and' she kissed her again and
again.
Then she staggered back to her lover.
She stretched her supplicating arms to
pitying heaven as though beseeching for
giveness. There was a quick, sharp re
port and Lola lay dying at her dead
lover's side.
Before her tired eyes closed forever she
â rolled Into Gabriella' s horror-stricken
face. "I am going with Alfredo, mi vida,"
â he -aid brokenly. She breathed another
â oft, sweet "Adlos" to Gabriella, smiling
all the while life ebbed away. And even
in death's icy chill she looked at them
with the same frozen smile.
The soldier buried them together and
marked their names in life blood that
their parents might And the spot. Then
he carried Gabriella to the nearest ranch,
where for days she hovered in the valley
of the shadow.
And this Is why there is weeping in the
"house of Padilla and wailing in the house
of Alvarez. And this is why Gabriella is
coming to a San Francisco convent. Not
this time as a merry pupil, but to take
the veil of the novitiate.
For Gabrlella's heart lies buried by the
green banks of the river Yaqul, wherÂ«
the i blood-stained headstone marts the
grave of Lolita and Alfredo.

Some quick love making is now going
on in the Choctaw Nation, Indian Ter
ritory. It is estimated that 1000 white
men will carry off Choctaw brides be
tween now and the flrst of next month.
About 5000 white men have already won
Choctaw brides and the land and money
that accompanies them.
The cause of Hie rush Is a recent an
nouncement of the Dawes Commission
that after the first of the month all per
son not Choc-taws by blood will not be
enrolled on the citizenship list. This
means no white men who marry Choc
taw women wiil be allowed to share in
lands and moneys of the Choctaw tribe.
Hence quick love making on the part of
civilized man.
The Choctaw girls are rather pretty and
some are highly educated. Those who
are not fullbloods refuse to marry In
dians, hence there is a great demand for
whites. Choctaw girls marry at th age
of 17. Because of their 550 acres of land
(equal amount being given to their hus
bands), no trouble is experienced in find
ing a suitable companion.
The complexion of these girls is a clear
white. Their eyes and hair are black, as
a rule, although some are perfect blondes.
They are of a kind and loving disposi
tion, and are said by the white men who
have tried to make excellent wives.
To avoid tramps and degenerates mar
rying these girls, the Choctaw laws pro
vide thai all white men. before they can
be admitted to. the tribe, must produce
recommendation of good character from
the County Judge of the county where
they last resided.
1 It is said that some of the most beau
! tiful and popular girls of the Choctaw
â  tribe have received proposals of marriage
from alleged French and English men of
title, but because they refused to prove
their ancestry were rejected.
It is a queer sight to go into a Choc
taw town just now. At the hotels are
stopping at least a dozen men whose sole
business is courting Choctaw women, with
the purpose of matrimony.22

Of the San Francisco bachelors who
cleave to a home life Mayor Phelan is a
type! The old family place at Seven
teenth and Valencia streets has never
passed from Phelan hands, and the Mayor
lings to every blessed old Iron deer on

partly perhaps for the sake of her who

garden. She rests more Inside the spa
cious house, where high ceilings and
quaint decorations don't care a fig for
modern art. She and her son have al
ways been close comrades, and the place
beside the Mayor in his carriageâ the place
which certain San Francisco belles would
give their eyes to occupyâ has been seen
on many a Sunday afternoon held by Mrs.
Phelan.
When Mayor Phelan grows weary of the
care of wealth and the bickerings of a
great city, he takes refuge at Phelan
Park, his beautiful country place in the
Santa Cruz region. Here he can entertain
the favored few when the favored many
become a burden.
He is a college man and the old col
leglate spirit In any one is never quite
downed It prompted him to offer the.
prize football statue that gives a touch of
youth to the stern exterior of the Hop
kins Art Institute.
He delights in music, and that, you
know, is one of Shakespeare's tests. He
likes art of all kindsâ especially pretty
tresses
Dr. Harry Tevis is another bachelor
who makes a home with his mother. He
has kept the Taylor-street residence as
headquarters since the death of Lloyd
Tevis, his father. Just now, however, he
has left the madding crowd and retired
with all his Glbsonesque beauty to a
lonely ranch, and he won't play with San
Francisco society any more, so there
now. Rumor busies Itself over his re
tirement, and if there is a love affair
mixed up with it San Francisco will try
to find out.
Wealth has not prevented his labor in
the lino of a chosen profession. He is a
physician who does not bother to practice
overmuch, but it sounds original,
you know, to sport a "Dr." before one's
nam.-.
His great pleasure lies in art, and this
means more to him than society. He
spends much time and money in choosing
beautiful things for his homeâ pictures,
which he appreciates with the true in
stinct of the art lover, are everywhere
about him. House decoration is a fad,

errs In a color scheme, and the flowers he
chooses are always the right flowers. He
works with the genius of infinite pains,
ordering changes here and there where
his keen artistic sense notes an effect that
is not quite right. Guests at the recent
Ames wedding perhaps did not know that
Harry Tevis was the decorator.
Raphael Weill is a bachelor of another
type. He is a club manâ the real thingâ
and he makes his abode under the wings
of the Bohemian owl. He is treading
along the path that leads to middle ago
no years, and the youngest of the smart
set do not Interest at that age so much
as they did; but Mr. Weill has as genial
a soul as ever, and the little dinners
delight. His Paris trips are frequent, and
he finds the ladies of Paris quite as much
to his taste as those here. i lis roly-poly
Frenchiness naturally feels at home on
the Continent.
Fred McNcar is in busy business down
on California street, and when the day's
work Is over he crosses on the same ferry
boat that carries less fashionable hu
manity to the warmer climate over the
bay. His home is in Oakland, but San
Francisco society claims much of his
leisure time. He is very popular with the
young ladles of the smart set.
The owner of the famous Hastings
Ranch, near Sierra Madre, Is one of the
best known bachelors in the south. Mr.
Hastings is fond of country life and he
makes the ranch his headquarters, but
Los Angeles society knows him well. He
makes complete many a theater party in
the southern city, and he Is the head and
front of southern coaching. Coaching Is
his fad. He drives perfectly.
He spends much of his time ln New
York, which was once his home. It was
there that his father acquired the great
wealth that has now passed on to the
son and daughters. Mr. Hastings brings
a strong whiff of New Yorkness to Cali
fornia.
The Martin brothers^ Walter and Peter.
are sought in San Francisco society.
They add two more names to the list of
home-loving bachelors. When out of the
public eye they may be found in the big
whi*e house out on Broadway, the big
colonial house that overlooks the sea and
takes every fogs' drenching before the
most of the town has heard whispers of
it. Mrs. Martin's exquisite taste makes a
home worth coming to.
Reuben Lloyd Is one of the substantial
bachelors. He lives in the substantial
family home on Folsom street, keeps
house with his mother in a substantial
way, and attends like clockwork to a
substantial business Half-past 7 every
morning finds him in his office, and his
recreation does not come until work Is
thoroughly attended to. This recreation
i- found in his horses. His black saddle
horse was a well-known frequenter of the
park for many years, and had the reputa
tion of being the finest saddle-horse in
the State. Its best days are past now,
but Mr. Lloyd may bo seen in his phae
ton behind other well-belOved horses that
have taken Its place.
Mr. Lloyd's love affairs have been more
than Cupid could count on twice his lin
gers, and although he is past his romantic
age he has not been given up entirely by
persistent loveliness. The only young
ladles to whom he is attentive just now
are his nieces, whom he chaperones vig
ilantly.
Santa Barbara is about to acquire a
new millionaire in Mr. Bacheller of Chi
cago. Ho baa been spending a number of
past winters in California and lie has
chosen Santa Barbara's summery climate
in which to make his home. He is not a
society man In the strict sense, but he
likes a few good friends. He likes the
sight-seeing of our State and ne likes
the fish dinners of our seaside resorts.
He says that he is waiting for an ideal
hotel to be built in Santa Barbara before
ne can De perfectly happyâ he \*Hl

He is a wonderfully kind manâthought
ful of the little acts and words that it is
usually a woman's part to think of.

in town. The Mercantile Library claims
some of his time and he is a boon to
charities. The Doctor's Daughters is an
organization that can tell tales of his
good heart and open purse. A man must
have something to look after and if a
young lady finds him not wealthy enoucu
for the demands of her taste then chari
ties may benefit thereby.
William Frank Goad Jr. is the Frank

Fred Greenwood lived in the vine-cover
ed me on Pacific avenue until last
spring. Since then his mother and sister,
who were his companions, have been trav
eling, and he is living a more truly bach
elor life in Belvedere. He may be seen
much of the time on horseback, for rid
ing is one of his chief delights. He Is an
easy-going, well-liked sort of young man
whom San Francisco misses.
Tie great leader of everything that hap
pens here socially Is, of course. Eld M.
Greenway. His home is at the Bohemian
Club. He has great organizing and ex-
ecutlve powersâ powers that tell, by the
way, quite as much in the social as the
business world. He is the heart and soul
of a party.
It Is said that there is not a man In San
Francisco who knows more about eating
than Mr. Oreenway. Ho is an epicure of
the first water. The geniality that makes
him popular in the club and the ballroom
also wins him a place in the hearts of bal
let girls. for whom he has a weakness.
They have never been known to lack at
tention at any affair where he was.
. He was a Southern man once upon a
time. He comes of an aristocratic old
Maryland family. His mental question is
that of the tdelphian: Who were your
parents? Apropos- a young lady showed
great anxiety at a dinner as to who her
neighbor was to be and requested Mr.
Greenway to be careful in seating her.
"When people are so fussy about other
people I always grow suspicious," he re
lates, "and when I investigated I found

Fred Webster and Harry Holbrook are
two more society bachelors. Mr. Webster
lives at the Pacific Union Club and Mr.
Holbrook has his own home.

in traveling. He has been around the

His South American parrot never says a
cheerful word to any member of the fam

A wealthy bachelor who has always
kept apart from the maddest whirl of
society is Dennis Searles. His father ac
quired an immense fortune in the borax
mines near Mojave and Dennis' boyhood
was passed there until he was old enough
to be sent to a boys' school. He after
ward took a course in engineering at
Stanford University and made a brilliant
record. He had the reputation of. being
one of the ablest' students there. He was
probably the wealthiest. College girls and
college men both. liked him, but he chose
a few close friends rather than the many.
Since graduating he has disappeared in
the lonely mining country again, where
the greatest diversion is riding over blis
tering sand and stinging cactus to greet
the overland train as it slacks up for a
10 o'clock Mojave breakfast. Mr. Searles*

the same woman been placed in a large

Scrupulous cleanliness will accomplish
much in the way of beauty. You all know
who have tried it that there is nothing in
the way of a complexion beautifier equal
to tin daily bath. Not only will it keep
the skin .healthy and fresh, but it will
also develop the figure. The woman who
lives in the backwoods has little^time and
scarcely any opportunity for a daily
plunge. Consequently her complexion
gets sallow and the skin falls Into dis
tressing little lines long before it should.
A woman can rr_ike or mar "*"Â»r own
loveliness. She can, by an utter disregard
of the laws oi hygiene ami a neglect of
the few little arts of the toilet, lose en
tirely that charm of face and form that
nature obviously intended should be hers.
I cannot understand why any one should
look with contempt upon the desire to
appear young and pretty, or consider it
a folly to keep her complexion soft and
lovely by the use of a harmless cos
metic. â¢.'-'-,- : 7- i;
It will do no woman harm to know that
a few drops of soothing lotion will trans
form a pair of rough, red hands into soft
white ones; that systematic care of the
complexion will keep it smooth and ward
off wrinkles, and that an eagerness to
read clever books and to know things, and
a lively interest In the current events of
the day, will brighten the eyes as nothing
else can. I say It without the fear of
contradiction that the woman who pos
sesses this knowledge Is far more charm-
Ing and attractive than she in whose way
no beautifying whims have ever come.
The woman who has this knowledge and
applies it is the one who will develop into
the beautiful, white-haired, Interesting
grandmother of the next generation, as
dainty, as straight and as youthful as was
the mother of the past generation.

"Fine," Captain Whipple explained, is
a synonym for "stale," the result of over

To get your nails in good condition go to

Football atmosphere is always charged
with uncertainty. You feel it as soon as
you come within Its radius. Until the end

whether or where they will play. To
them the football game dims all else,

way to steam the face is to fill a basin
with boiling water, envelop the head in a

do not approve of vaseline for the hair.

very excellent cold cream: Spermaceti,

ounces; rosewater, three-fourths of an
ounce; benzoin, three drops. Heat the
spermaceti, white wax and almond oil in
a porcelain kettle, and when they have be

from the fire and add the rosewater very
quickly. Beat briskly with an egg-beater
until fluffy, and just as the mixture begins
to cool, add the three drops of benzoin.

THE football players are now in
training. No man could step out
of the regular routine of everyday
life and suddenly live the life of
an expert in training. The sudden
stoppage of all the luxuries which peo
ple allow themselves would be too much
for his constitution. He would be
troubled with insomnia and would
break down. The stopping of a bottle
of beer at night has been known to give
a man insomnia, and the giving up of
tobacco produces its ill effects at first.
It is absolutely necessary to give up
luxuries slowly. If you are going to
bed every night at 12 you cannot sud
denly make a habit of retiring at S.
That is the reason so many would-be
athletes break down early in their ca
reer. They leave off all the luxuries of
life and begin its severities without due
preparation.
Two very prominent football players
have placed themselves in my care for
the summer or until such time as they
are to go into training; and the work I
shall give them to do is identical with
the work that should be taken by every
very healthy man who goes on a sum
mer vacation.
The safest rule for the man who in
tends to get in training and who hopes
at least to tone up his system is to be
gin with before-breakfast exercise. Be
fore he has bathed he can exercise five
minutes with his arms, and by pump
ing. After his bath he can exercise
three minutes more. The window should
be wide open to give him plenty of good
air for his lungs during this perform
ance; and if these directions are fol
lowed he will have a fine appetite for
breakfast.
The breakfast meal can be taken with
the family, eating whatever is served.
Do not,* however, take more than one
honor of the team. Aspiring "scrub" or
substitute is genuinely grieved when a
star player who cannot be duplicated is
injured. So- they cheered for Captain
Jim's recovery.
Anti-footballites have prated about the
"brute uppermost" influence of the game.
True they have a mighty disdain for dis
figurements or injuries. Al Lean was
summoned to cripples' corner in the gym
nasium.
"Man on the stretcher waiting for a
knee bandage," said the messenger.
"Who?"
Don't know his nameâ a freshman.
"Let him wait." said Toothpick. "More
it's an honor for a frcshie to get laid out.
The longer he waits the harder he can
blow about it."
Yet for all this, that, or the other, who
says these boys are dull to kindly feel
ings is deaf and blind. There is an un
dercurrent of true sympathy that washes
away the sting of sharp jest. Football
rubs off any gossamer veneering and ex
poses the good and bad. If a football
man is dubbed a "flne fellow" by his
brother players he - deserves the title.
Coach Cochran, who ought to know, says
these boys are all "fine fellows."
A fine set of men they certainly are who
will punt and tackle for the blue and gold.
It would be difficult to give a composite
from the types that make up the team.
On the field in tangled mass all players
look alike. But here, shorn of their para
phernalia, with the dirt washed off. tney
show blonde and brunette, clean and ooy
ish faces and trimly built figures, not
overly tali.
Every man bristles with a football bang
and enthusiasm. "We're out .to win,"
they shout across the "fist-banged" table.
The Stanfordites are discussed freely, but
not maliciously. I hear on all sides
kindly words for individuals. "Ches"
Murphy, most famous of the cardinals,
is pronounced "a prince of fine fellows."
It is the opposing team In the abstract
that is battered and tattered -by wordy
missiles.
One of the two lamps in the room sudden
ly flickered and went out. Not a boy in the
room had a match with him. "No smok
ing, you know," said my neighbor, "so we
don't carry them these days."
When the boys had eaten everything
in sight save the linen and crockery. they
tilted their chairs and sang college songs
and gave their college yells as only a
college boy can.
It was 7 o'clock when they broke rank,
locked arms and strolled off for their
sleeping quarters, still singing in their
fresh, full boyish voices. Three hours'
digging for to-morrow's recitations, and
then to bed. for at 10 o'clock it's "lights
out" in football quarters.
Captain Whipple did the honors as far
as the train. "What do you do when the
boys complain to you?" I asked.
"Oh, I pass them over to Manager
Muma." -â¢'â  V
"And he?"
"Well, lie usually tells them to take
their troubles to Al Lean."
"And he?"
"Tells them to forget them."
"How will you boys feel If you win tne
game?" I asked, in parting.
"We won't be able to walk on eartb
for a week," replied the captain.
"If you lose?"
"We won't be able to eat for a week."

cup of coffee and only one lump of
sugar in the cup. Butter can be eaten,
and any other food that is liked. Only
half a glass of water must be taken,
and no water for an hour after break
fast.
All meals must .be taken with less
than a glass of fluid, and after dinner
there must be no nap.
A man can take twenty pounds off his
weight in a month by abstaining from
water and by taking no naps during the
day. After that comes exercise. Take
all you can get of it; nothing heroic
but be always on the go. Join moun
tain climbing expeditions, play tennis
and croquet. Patronize the golf links
don't sit still. Cultivate the habit of
waiting on yourself; do your own
stooping; don't ask people to pick up
things for you. By this very simple
system I reduced an English nobleman
last summer from 225 pounds to 175. He
reduced so fast it alarmed me, but he
kept his health well.
The football athletes in summer add
a few laws to these. Twice a day they
take violent exercise in a gymnasium.
They swing on the bar, leap the hurdles g
and sprint until they are in a great
glow. Then they are well rubbed down
with warm water and alcohol. This as
sists the formation of muscle. The mat
ter of going into training is not serious
after that. In training, preparatory to
a race, they are compelled to diet and
all sweets are denied them. But lat
terly the Yale athletes are eating ice
cream once a day and cake at supper.
They are also drinking ale.
The man who wants to get in good
condition must let strong stimulants
alone. He can drink a bottle of beer
with his dinner and one or two at night.
But this is about the limit. Wine will
upset him and throw him back to
where he began.

There is even now a demand, which

they lead to financial success.
It Is because of its appreciation of
these facts that the University of Cali

\f \y rooms, it wasâ In evening

of glories of the grand tier that had start

"I never see all those women in dia
monds, glittering like that, without won
dering whether all their diamonds are not
sham,'' said a man named Homan.
"Yes." said another man, "and whether
the sham ones don't make just as good
a showing as the real. In other words,
art genuine diamonds worth while?"
"They certainly are," said Dudley, "un
til you can make something that Is not
a genuine diamond and yet glitters just as
well."
"There's no doubt, I suppose," said Ho
man, "that it takes an expert to tell a
genuine etone from an Imitation. And If
that's the case all the money spent on
diamonds Is spent simply to satisfy the
experts."
"Yes," maid Dudley, "but It doesn't
take much practice to make an expert in
that lineâ much less practice than you
might think, even for diamonds. When
you come to rubles and emeralds you only
need to see two or three good specimens
to be able to tell real from imitation at a
glance, If you have any eyes."
"H'm!" said Homan. "All the same,

prove most bewildering to any one who
does not possess a key to the mystery.
Many who are really good linguists hes
itate to take up the study of Chinese,
fearing that the time spent in the ef
fort to gain even a most unsatisfactory
knowledge of its intricacies will be
simply wasted. _:-â ;
Dr. Gardner, however, has proved the
fallacy of this widely entertained be
lief, for he has demonstrated that it Is
possible, In one college year, for any
one of ordinary education and a real
desire to learn to obtain a practical
working knowledge of Cantonese the
principal and most generally under
stood dialect of the Flowery Kingdom â
together with a vocabulary extensive
enough for all ordinary conversational
and business purposes.
For years Dr. Gardner has made a
close and exhaustive study of China
and the Chinese their dialects, litera
ture and business methods. As official
interpreter of the Custom House Chin
mond that would take in even an expert."
"Yen have, eh?" said Dudley. "Then it
must have been a Carrier diamond."
"And what in thunder Is a Garrier dia
mond?" I asked Homan, knowing full
well that a story was coming.
"Simply a diamondâ an Imitation dla-
mondâ made by Adolph Garrier. Where
did you see the one you speak of, Ho
man?"
"A pawnbroker of remarkable honesty
showed it to me," said Homan. "And
when I asked him how much he. would
take foi it he laughed and said It was
not worth more than $50. I would have
thought it easily worth $500. He told me
it came from Paris, that was all, except
that lie said there were no more made
like It now. "7:-.
"That's it." said Dudley. I have no
doubt it was one of old Adolphe's pro
ductions, The old fool! He might have
made an enormous fortune if his heart
hadn't been so soft, and two enormous
fortunes if he hadn't been so superhu
manly honest."
"Where did you hear about him?" I
asked Dudley.
"1-1 ear about him? Why, I knew the
man as well as I know you, for a short
time, at least. Probably no one else in
this part of the world can tell you the

if you like. It isn't a long story.

tact with nearly all the different classes
and conditions represented by China's
wandering sons, and from his own ex
perience he has been able to evolve a
system of Instruction so simple and yet
so rich in results as to merit the high
est commendation.
Last October five interested and yet
doubtful persons gathered in the lec
ture room of the Hopkins Art Institute
one evening and listened to Dr. Gard
ner as he gave a brief outline of the
manner in which he proposed to teach
Cantonese. After that first lesson
the class increased rapidly until twen
ty-five met every other night during
the regular college terms and devoted
a short hour and a half to listening and
taking notes while their instructor pro
ceeded, by a most original but emi
nently effective method, to impress up
on their minds the evident peculiarities
and the less evident but no less real
simplicity of the language which they
were intent upon learning.
In this class there were six ladies,
any of them were of any .value. Most
of them, 1 knew, had what they call 'silk
flushes' in them.
"Well, a diamond merchant of my ac
quaintance, to whom I went -with my
sapphires, told me he wanted to Intro
duce me to a queer character, and in that
way I met old Garrier in my friend's
back office. >r. -7
"Afterward I improved the acquaint
ance when I was in Paris. It . turned
out that Carrier was a very remarkable
chemist. He would tell me a great many
things that I didn't know, saying there
were no more mysteries about science in
these days â one.
"When I asked him what that one
mystery was, he said it was the mystery
by which he could make diamonds at
little more cost than the cost of making
glass buttons.
" 'And don't you Intend to profit by it?'
I asked him.
"He chuckled and said that he intended
to make himself rich and many thousands
of rich people poor. But he wouldn't tell
me how he was going to do it. and there
was one corner of his laboratory that he
always kept screened off and wouldn't let
me enter.
"I had made up my mind that old Gar
rier was a visionary. But one day he met
me, quite by accident, as it happened, at
a cafe, and that was when he convinced
me that there was a great deal in what
he said. He pulled out of his pocket what
I took to be a superb chain of diamonds
about fifteen inches long, each . stone
about as big as the top of a pencil.
"'What Is that?' he asked me, with a
grin.
" 'A very flne diamond necklace,' I said.

THE SUNDAY CALL.
two of them medical students who see
a premising future before them as prac
titioners among the Chinese women and
children, and of the twenty-five stu
dents no less than eleven received cer
tificates of graduation at the end of
the course on the 27th of last June.
Every one of these fortunate eleven is
able to converse intelligibly with almost
any Chinese whom he or she is likely
to meet in the ordinary course of events
either here or in China. While many
other dialects beside the Cantonese are
in use within the borders of the Chinese
empire a person who understands this
one dialect well can manage to com
municate quite easily with those who
speak any of the others, and for reason
of this Volapuk-like quality the Can
tonese if, especially in favor with al!
who wish to use their acquaintance
wi'h Mongolian speech and script
purely in a business way.
Of the eleven graduates Mr. Hilliard
J. Rosencrantz stood highest, for he not
only received the regular diploma of the
University of California as a reward for
diamonds' made by art. not by natureâ
and at a cost of 200 francs and some odd
centimes.'
"I tried as hard as I could not to offend
the old man, but my astonishment nearly
got the better of me. The idea of making
those fifty stones at an average cost of 4
francsâ SO centsâ apiece! The setting must
have cost a good deal more than the
stones themselves at that rate.
"In order to convince me, which he
seemed to want to do, Garrier took me
next morning. to a jeweler in the Palais
Royal. ! He asked for the expert of the
establishment, paid a fee of 5 francs and
got the opinion of the expertâ one of the
recognized experts of Parisâ that the
stones were real.
" They are not all perfectly matched,'
the expert said. 'Some are of a bluish
tint and some are straw diamonds. But
they have a fine luster.'
"Then Garrier laughed and asked what
would be the value of the whole piece.
" "About 18,000 or 20.000 francs.'
: " 'Monsieur Garrier,' I said, 'do you
really mean that you made those stones
yourself?'
"'I mean It," he said. 'And In another
year the diamonds of the British crown,
the Russian crown and all the crowns In
the world will have fallen off in value at
least 80 per cent. Also, my friend, the
great South African mines will not be
worth the trouble to work them.' .
"As a further proof he took me with
him to a pawnbroker's and there flung
his necklace on the counter, asking what
the man would give for them if they
were sold outright. The pawnbroker
said the Government rules would not al
low him to buy diamonds outright: but
he was quite willing, after examining the
stones closely, to lend as much as 5000
francs on them.
"At that Garrier laughed aloud, very
much to the disgust of the men behind
the counter. He plainly told the men
that the stones were manufactured, and
the men as plainly refused to believe it.
"You see, If old Garrier had not been
honest, he could then and there have got
a profit of at least $900 on his diamonds.
But he would not sellâ pawnâ them
under any false pretenses. He was de
termined to do the whole business fairly.
He was so very fair and open about
the whole business that it very toon be
gan to be talked about among the jewel
ers. The thing became a nine days'
wonder in Paris. And . that was what
brought Carrier's enterprise to an end
all through his kindness of heart.
â¢ "One day a card was sent up to him
in his laboratoryâ the card of a count
ess. Garrier was not accustomed to re
â¢, c .?lY c i adles in h,s sanctum, so he was a
little flustered.
"When the countess entered she seemed
in some distress. Good old Garrier asked
her what he could do for her, and her
only reply was: 'You are ruining me
monsieur. * c>
n^ T en she told , hlm her tale of woe
and he recognized it as genuine, for the
Paris. n Card WaÂ£ very well known in
"She was a widow; a Frenchwoman
herself, but the widow of a Brazilian who
had lost all his lands by gambling of one
kind and another. When this Brazilian
count died he left his wife and her two
daughters nothing but her dowry and an
uncommonly fine collection of precious
stones, mostly diamonds. If she had
had more business sense she would have
sold the whole collection of diamonds at
the outset and Invested the money. If
she had done that the price of diamonds
need not have troubled her. But, woman
like, she must lock up her diamonds in
a bankâ except a few which see sold,
to put her daughters in a fashionable
convent schoolâ und wait until the girls
should be marriageable before she would
realize on the bulk of the jewels in order
to provide them with dowries. In the
meantime she had been living on her own
dowry. And now her banker, or some
body, had warned her of the rumor of
Carrier's discovery. She fully realized
that, if this old magician could turn out
artificial diamonds at a trifling cost, and
so good that experts, could not tell them
from the real thing, her fortune would
soon cease to be worth mentioning.
"Well, I believe the Countess wept over
old Garrier, and he, being a soft-hearted
simple old bachelor, was overcome by her
tears. He hadn't even the sense to think
of doing what I suggested to him when
he told me about Itâ promise the Countess
not to sell any artificial stones until she
had had a year to dispose of her real
ones. What he did was to solemnly prom
ise her never to sell any diamonds of his
own making. ' 'A>- : ;- -

larly, since each lesson is a rung ir
the ladder up which they are trying tc
climb, and the loss of even one makes
upward progress very much more dif
ficult, and to give their teacher their
earnest and undivided attention. Foi
himself the doctor requires only a small
blackboard and a bit of crayon, and
with the aid of these at each lesson he
manages to impart ideas and add to his
students' vocabulary in most surprising
fashion.
The Chinese language is primarily a
pictorial one, each character being a
representation, of course conventional
ized almost out of recognition â of cer
tain objects, acts or events. Dr. Gard
ner's extremely comprehensible systerh
consists for the most part of analyzing
these characters, resolving them into
their rudiments and then showing the
whys and wherefores of their many
combinations.
Ten or twelve word characters and
phrases are thus dissected and em
bedded in the minds of the pupils at
each lesson, and each being perfectly
undersood in its proper order, forms a
solid foundation for the next layer of
knowledge.' The various musical tones
which make the conversation of good
tempered and therefore mutually com
plimentary Chinese sound like a pleas
ing vocal exercise, cease to puzzle the
Caucasian brain as soon as its owner
understands that every word in the
Chinese language has four tones of
three series each upper, middle and
lower and that these are all very eas
ily learned by conversation and by con
text. 'â  -:?;-' iJ .
As is the case with all other lan
guages, mere classroom instruction in
Chinese avails little unless the would
be learner puts into daily practice
hourly practice if possible every scrap
of knowledge that is dealt out to him.
In order to learn the language of any
country quickly and well one must
mingle with the people and talk with
them familiarly on the ordinary affairs
of daily, life and business. To the fact
that Mr. Rosencrantz, as soon as he
had learned enough words and phrases
to convince a Chinese that he w-as
really struggling to learn his peculiar
tongue,., devoted all his spare time to
talking or trying to talk to every In
telligent looking Sam Yup man that
came in his way, is due his present sur
prising command of the Cantonese dia
lect and his future most excellent busi
ness prospects.
The class which has begun to study
under Dr. Gardner this year numbers
over sixty persons, who gather every
Monday, "Wednesday and Friday even
ing in the Art Institute at 7 o'clock and
devote every moment of the time as
signed them to the serious and intent
study of the queer characters which
look so fantastically meaningless to
most of us, but, like many other things,
convey so much of real value to those
who understand.
As the only class In Cantonese ln
practical operation in the United States,
this gathering of earnest and ambitious
workers possesses far more than a
merely local interest.
To tell the truth, I don't think old
Garner made such a big sacrifice as It
would have been in your case or mine.
He didn't really care for making money;
what he did care for was science and
realizing the power it gave him.
â¢Following on the Countess' visit was
a. grand distribution of artificial diamonds
by old Garrier The odd thing about it
was that he selected the Countess herself
to present that wonderful diamond neck
lace to. lie gave me two stones, one of
which I had set in a ring, the other in a
collar button. I also had the satisfaction
of seeing aim dismantle the complicated
apparatus which he called his 'diamond
mill.' "
"What did you do with the two dia
monds he gave you?" Homan asked.
"One I gave to a lady," said Dudley, "I
.might tell yen about that some other
day. The other I have her**."
He went to a drawer and', after rum
maging about for some time, produced a
leather case in which was a large dia
mond collar button.
"And you mean to say that isn't a real
diamond?" I asked him.
"It la not a natural diamond," he said.
"It is the work of old Carrier's hands
âmade In his diamond mill. If it were
not for the association of it and the scar
city of Garrier's masterpieces in these
days, I would sell you that button for $10.
But, you see. poor old Garrier died not
long after he raised that little sensation
In Paris, and the secret died with him."from Qass~Â£rum player in a Circus to theatrical Manager
The Prince of All Vaudeville Managers Who Has -Played
More Varied Parts and Had a Greater Number of
Amusing and Thrilling Experiences Than _ :
Probably Any Other Man in the
Theatrical Profession,
THE privileged person who has the
"open Became" to the rehearsals
which are held ln the Orpheum
every* Sunday morning will find that
the chief figure on these occasions
Ib always a rather thin and by no
meane tall gentleman, generally wearing
a comfortably loose gray business suit, a
high silk hat and a cigar.
This individual Is the central pup. about
which every or.c else ln his vicinity ro
tate* for the time being. He is the Alpha
and the Omega of this preparatory enter
tainment, which Is given for his special
benefit, and during Its course he plays
more parts than any of the regular actors
therein, for he officiates as audience, lit
erary, dramatic and musical critic, call
boy, prompter, stage manager and adapt
er,
As an audience he Is not exhilarating,
for he Is never enthusiastic and Is rarely
known to vouchsafe to any of the actors
and actresses who appear at these special
performances, no matter how great may
be their merit, even a modicum of the ap
plause so dear to 'he histrionic '-art.
But things have not always been thus
with John Morrlsey. To whatever position
he has attained It has been by Indefatiga-
Me efforts and a most severe practical
pchoollng. No more entertaining mo
ments can be passed than to get Morrisey
ln reminiscent mood and have him tell of
his early strurrsrle* and boyhood.
He was a mite of a freckled youngster
ln those days. He was nobody at all but
Johnny. People now call him Morris of
the Orpheum.
"Those days" were when he started in
the show business. They were a long,
long while ago? and they were not very
happy. They were full cf hard work by
day and hard .tourneys by night, and beat
ings hoth times. Heaven knows why he
kept to the life. Perhaps because there
was no pleasantor one to choose. For he
was a lonely little freckled boy. and It is
the lonely people of this world who do
most of its work.
Morrlsey made his debut In a basket.
A .1-:g_ler named Ray saw a coming man
behind the freckles and took possess! of
him for his basket trick It was Heller's
adaptation of an old East Indian bit of
magic. The youngster's part of the per
formance was to climb Into the basket,
let the audience see him curled up there,
then to be covered and pitted through
the cover by the magician. Ray drew a
blood-stained sword forth from the basket
and all the little children in the audience
said "Ah!" while their mammas said
"Ugh:" Then, before there was time to
go home and dream bloody dreams In
popped this Irrepressible Johnny at the
entrance door, and "âºown the aisle he
marched, not one whit like the dead
walking.
The basket was a naughty fibbing thing
ar.d it had a false bottom. It was the
victim's business to get through that false
bottom In quick time. But now and then
a very- little boy will make a very little
E:Â«Vf2^s__Sl^^ R^sv_rcTÃTE
blunder, even with the best Intentions in
the world. That Is why John stuck In
the basket one night when the false bot
tom failed him.
It was only a second that he stuck, but
it was a second too much. Presto, after
him came the sword.
It hurt.
He cried out lustily with all the strength
of his little boy lungs. He was such a
very young youngster, you recollect.
That Is about all of the story. Only
that there was a man who waxed angry
at an audience's laughter and a little boy
who crawled away to a late bed with a
lame body and a sore heart. But there
were so many little boys ln the world that
Just one didn't count.
In spite of all his troubles, and by them,
John Morrisey was learning the show
business. He was learning It ln the all
round wav that men did in those daysâ
the way that he claims makes the best
ehowmen "The fellow who knows only
one specialty Is lost if he turns to any
other line of work, and he can never be a
manager because he doesn't understand
all sides of the matter." Mr. Morrlsey will
tell you His curriculum was made up
of courses In Juggling, clowning, singing,
playing and doing the end man in a
traveling minstrel company.
The small Johnny was shifted from
hand to hand faster than a Juggler's ball.
After the basket trick with Ray came a
tour with Walter Wentworth, the contor
tionist. This same Wentworth has seen
three-quarters of a century now and he
Btlll lives to continue selling his double-
Jointed body to physicians. The two
traveled afoot on their route, and the
Utile back ached many a weary ache un
der the load of costumes and properties
put upon it.
There were never such hot and. dusty
days since time began as those days of
tramping. It was thirsty August weather
in the Eastern States, and when yellow
peaches hang close to a shed roof and the
shed roof slopes temptingly toward a
fence: who wouldn't?
John would.
He simply couldn't help it. The con
tortionist was sitting on the box of tights
farther down the road, and John mounted
the fence.
The shed was an easy climb. ThÂ«
peaches swung in the drowsy air and th*
shades of the windows were low against
an afternoon sun. Besides, there were so
many peaches that nobody would ever
care.
But there was one person awake. She
was small and harmless enough under
the bigness of her sunbonnet, but she
meant business.
"You're a naughty, bad boy." she
stormed as she flung away a Rolla book.
"I've got a real burglar at last," she
added to the dog. "and you must kill
him all dead or you can't have a single
bone for your supper."
She started toward the chair. John saw
at a glance that she and the dog were
confidential friends. He also saw that
the dog was a person to command re
spect. He measured distances and he
saw that there was nothing for it but
strategy.
He rose majeetic upon the shed roof.
He was very dirty, but his dignity was
a wonder.
"Walt!" he commanded ln the voice of
a prophet. "If you stir one step to re
lease that dog I will conjure up my
devil.**
His language was born of his profession.
His plan was born of his own little head.
The sunbonneted vengeance stopped,
doubtful. He followed up an advantage.
"Come hither. ___JL'' ha cried* J3fi
turned and beckoned to Wentworth, who
had started along.
"I am attacked. Come and frighten
away this wicked female," he continued.
Wentworth knew his man and he
guessed enough to come in at the cue. The
vengeance saw something in human form
alight upon the shed roof.
Then began a series of the most dia
bolical contortions that ever took place
THE SUNDAY CALL.

The hardest seven years of all Morri
sey's life were the following years spent
under the canvas. He passed from circus
to circus during that time, but It was al
ways somebody's tanbark. "Most of the
circuses that he traveled with camped for
only a night at a place, and It was up
with the stakes and away every midnight.
Twelve at night was breakfast time, and
the journey followed. The morning hours
that men call night were spent on the
road, and the usual bed was a blanket
spread on the pole wagon. A night in the
band wagon was a now-and-then luxury.
Sometimes the rain sneaked in under mis
erable covers and sometimes it didn't
trouble Itself to sneak at all. but lashed
his poor little body when there was no
wagon cover.
John TloQÃibtY
In the morning there were animals to
rare for and tents to put up. There was
usually a cross ringmaster or a cross lion
keeper or a cross elephant to please. The
life was too hard for its livers to be good
natured all the time. There were two
elephants with one of these showsâ a big
one and a little one and It took all the
tact that John was master of to get the
youngster fed. The big elephant would
reach a snaky trunk stealthily over the
little one's head and snatch away a bite
before you could twinkle.
There was up end to the demands made
upon Morrisey's versatility. Besides the
work that the "hands" about a show do
now, he was required to play in the band,
to "clown It" and to sing and dance in
the concert that followed lo cents, please;
keep your seats after the show or you'll
miss, etc. The clown work he liked well
enough, but he hated the baas drum with
PHOTO BY
COOVER.^R_^,nu_ _LN Â«
a deadly hate that he could only relieve
by pummellng It. When the show would
draw near to a large town it would halt
ln the outskirts, touch up Its furbelows
and make a grand entrace ln the fore
noon with thi band in merry accord. Mr.
Morrlsey relates that when he had begged
dozens of times to be relieved from drum
duty he gave up all hope of mercy and
determined to relieve himself. So while
the parade was entering Albany by way
of a steep hill he deliberately and with
malice aforethought fell out of the band
wagon and rolled with his drum down the
hill. It wasn't good for the drumâ lt was
so bad for it. in fact, that the drummer
was put at other work. 7:' . v .. 7
The seven years of circus life led Mor
rlsey through our own States and Canada
besides. There were all kinds of adven
tures, from breaking down on rough
roads to smuggling liquor over the United
States line. The wages paid were so poor
that it was as "much as he could do to
keep body and soul together, and in spite
of this there was an outlay for each new
turn. He took part ln what was called
"The Barber Shop Act," wherein he was
the victim of the shaving, half drowned
at each performance in the generous
sudsing of the clown' barber. The same
suit was made to bear this dally ducking
for three years. ' , â¢ ( . -< ( *
Circus â¢ life very nearly wore out the
little fellow's strength, and while still in
his teens he gave It up for work in a St,
Louis stock company. In this he played
with Fritz Emmet, who was yet unknown.
But the class of entertainment proved a
little tame for Morrlsey, and ho soon
gave over this for a minstrel show.
Whitmore and Clark took him In hand
and he toured Canada and New -land
with them. The northern nights were so
cold 'hat he can remember rubbing a
snowball on the tips of both ears where
they were frostbitten. < Business wa<* so
bid for a time that the company lodged
anywhere that a roof could be found, and
a fire was un thought of. There were
mornlnsrs when the bedclothes were found
stitched with frost work to the foot of
the bed. There were breakfasts when one
coffee was ordered for three men and the
three took turns warming their hands at
the cup. ,
Morrisey's minstrel days date back to
the time when Walter Mo**OÃcn was at the
same business and when Georee Primrose,
had his fame vet to win. Primrose was
doing a cine dance in a little Buffalo
theater when Morrlsey first knew him.
The two of them were youne then, and
they formed a strong friendship that re
sulted In a plan to combine forces. But
one of the little thlnes that co to mold
nations and theater? happened, and West
took the place that was to have belonged
to our Orpheum manager.
Another move brought his path with
that of Emmet once more. This time they
were both to piny In the band. Fritz at
tended to the snare drum and John to the
bass, and they were required to'plav be
fore every performance In a balcony
built out in front of the theater. This
was to draw the crowd, and as soon as
the crowd arrived the band retired and
the drummers disappeared to their dress
ing rooms to make ready for their parts
In the play. The balcony hung low over
the street and was within flirting distance
of the crowd. John was old enough by
this time to improve opportunities. The
result was a flirtation that lasted during
the company's engagement.
The young lady of the case knew John
only as the player of the big bass drum,
and she never guessed him throueh the
disguise of his character part. That is
how it happened that she tried thus to
console him for what he represented to
her as his Inglorious position in the, com
pany:
"Jacky. I don't think you oueht to be
ashamed of your work one bit. Why. you
are much more important than any actor
in the company, even if they won't ac
knowledge it. I've seen them, and there
isn't one who can act worth a cent."
He never was very, susceptible to stage
fright, but now and then stumbling came
from too much or too little preparation
He tells of playing in the old Bowery
with Mrs. Paul Falk and singing "Annie
Laurie" under her directionâ or trying to,
for she had made him rehearse so steadily
that when he came on the stage he could
not remember a line. But for the most
part a manager could count on his being
clever ln emergencies.
He was once with a company which
was playing the "Black Crook." It was
the scene when j Black Crook sum-
mons Zamuel. Zamuel appeared, stepped
through a trap hole in the stage and
was picked up In the lower regions un
conscious. There was no understudy for
him so he had to be revived; meanwhile
there was an interval to j fill ln and the
stage manager grabbed Morrisey, who
was loafing In the wings, placed a
gnome's mask over, his head and a cloak
on his shoulders. "Get out there and
keep the audience busy while we patch
this fellow up." he said, and then Mor
rlsey found himself In the middle of the
stage without an Idea In his mind and an
ar.gry Black Crook glaring at him. A
derisive laugh from the front of the house
aroused him. He gave a yell, rushed at
the Black Crook, forced him Into a cor
ner and then, at the top of his voice,
roared the whole length of a stump
speech he had learned when with a min
strel show. It made a hit and by the
time the audience had finished applaud
ing 'his unrehearsed innovation Zamuel
had been aroused from his trance and was
ready to go on with his part.
He had hard discipline under old Ben
Trimble of "Trimble's Varieties." "The
old fellow used to listen like a cat to thÂ«
performance." Mr. Morrlsey says, "and
his way of letting us know that some
thing was going wrong was to shake
down the ashes ln the stove with such
a rattling as might have frightened
any one. We always listened for the
shaking."
Mr. Morrlsey declares that he made
the "hit of his life" In Cincinnati, where
he played Robert Forester in "Nick of
the Woods." The part of Forester Is a
goody-goody sort of a role, with a lot of
talk and no action, and feminine guar
dian angels continually stand between
him and threatening danger. The play
had a lone run, and every night ln the
last act Tlllle, the Indian girl, stepped
in between him and the bullet that
really ought to have ended his milk
and-water career. On the very last night
of the play, however, just as Tillle self
sacrificlngly did her duty, one of the
"set" trees fell over on Morrlsey and
knocked him senseless, to the uproarious
delight of the discriminating but utterly
unsympathetic^ audience.
"I never got so much applause before
or since." says the " veteran . manager,
"and I never deserved it less, for It was
not I but poetic justice that arranged
matters that time."
"One of the funniest performances that
I ever assisted in." he states, "was a
presentation of the play popularized by
handsome Montague, in which great
Interest centered around the affec
tion existing between a big New
foundland dog and his master. The
leading man's own dog generally ap
peared In this drama, but on this occa
sion he was invalided and we had to bor
row another one that 'knew not Daniel.'
He was a thorough amateur and got stage
fright in Its worst form, but he waj too
good-natured to bite, and so all through
that long performance one or the other of
us, to the delight of the whole company,
simply dragged him about by the collar to
the places where he was supposed to
bound with much alacrity and wagging of
tall because of his love for his persecuted
owner.
"In the last scene, wherei Jack comes
Into his fortune, and in the exuberance of
his happiness orders his dog admitted to
his ancestral drawing room, the spectacle
of the leading lady pulling that reluctant
beast along by the neck while he dug his
obstinate nails into the carpet, the while
she said admiringly, 'See how he loves
his master! There must be something
very sweet In your nature, Jack, to make
a poor animal care for you like this.*
made audience and actors roar In unison
and the curtain went down untimely In
the midst of a gale of laughter."
John Morrisey does not play drums now
adays nor pitch circus tents nor ride on
pole wagons. He does business ln softly
carpeted offices above the Orpheum and
often people come there to ask his advice
about starting on the stage. Sometimes
he gives them encouragement and some
times he sends them away disappointed.
It takes him less than five minutes oJ
talk to decide.
People from 5 years old to 60 come to
him. If the applicant is a woman and Is
determined to be heard he takes her
. downstairs to the big empty theater some
morning and lets her show him what she
can do. "If the applicant Is a man he does
not grant him a trial unless he gives real
2 promise.
"You can talk to a man, but you can***,
refuse a woman," he says.
"Everything in the vaudeville business
goes by fads. If we have a child per
forming here mothers from all over town
will bring their own darlings to me to
beg for an engagement. When Mrs. Shaw
was here I had calls from more than a
hundred whistlers."
Mr. Morrisey has great faith In Cali
fornia talent, especially that of the chil
dren. Little Arnold Grazer Is his newest
discovery in this line. The youngster's
amateur work caught the manager's eye.
and Arnold is now fairly started on his
career.
To 'protect Mr. Morrlsey, let mo add
that all Infants are not Arnolds,*'.

BY the cut of their shoes ye shall
know them, Is the fashionable
watchword of the hour. Of a truth
never was there a time when so
much attention was given to foot
gear. "Any old shape" is no longer good
enough. The shape of your boot dehnes
your niche in the world of fashion, Your
shoes are the telltales that proclaim you
Just behind the times or up to date.
Trifles make perfection, but perfection Is
no trifle. If you would be la mode you must
be perfection from the crown of your
head to the soles of your feel The best
_ reS woman Is the woman who appre
ciates the Importance of the finer points.
How often do you see a beautiful gown
and a pretty hat struggling in vain to
offset the bad effect of shabby shoes and
badly fitting gloves?
When every detail dovetails there is an
unmistakable air of harmony that is felt
even by those who are so blind they will
not see. An indefinable air of complete
ness clings to the tout ensemble.
There are more crimes committed
.gainst feet than any other member of the
S>odv. Gloves receive much more consld
eratlon. And yet, if my lady Is not well
mod she cannot possibly look well. It is
roily to think that shoes count for less In
'he general appearance than hats.
A woman with a graceful, queenly bear

nore beautiful sister. She attracts atten
tion where good looks and slovenly gait

feet. A perfect foot, like
perfect woman. is an artist's
dream. So if you are wise you
will buy a shoe perfectly cut and
large enough so thai the fallings
of your feet cannot betray them-
selves by ugly hills and ridges.
It is a matur of general comment
among the dealers that lovely woman no
longer buys her shoes a size too small, in
sisting rather on having them a size too
large. "If the shoe pinches, and it's a
woman, she buys them," said the cynics
of old. But not these days; If the shot
pinches my lady orders a larger pair.
The size of the shoe is a general point
easily mastered by those desirous of
learning the art of selecting a boot. Trust
to your sens* of feeling. If your boot
presses your foot will cry for mercy. Be
wise and heed its slightest hint. You'll
have to sooner or later. And a comfort
able shoe in time save nine. / Â»;" .,'.-.
But now for the more difficult points
that must be learned. Because your shoes
are not down at the heels or out at the
toes docs not mean thai they look well.
Are they made of the right kind of leath
er? Are they the proper cut? Are they
suitable for the occasion? Ask yourself
these three questions, and when you can
answer them correctly you may go to the
head of the class on the subject.
First, as to the leather. There are three
kinds generally patent leather, vici
kid and calfskin.
Patent leather defies even the manu
facturers. It Ii Impossible to tell whether
It Is a good piece or one that will crack.
Patent leather Is never guaranteed. Who
buys it (and who does not) must take it at
her own risk.
Vlci kid is a fine soft kid, used exclu
sively for dress and deml-dress sheen. Al
most all soft shoes are sold as vlcl kid,
but it is really used only in the better
grade goods, being too expensive to use
for shoddy boots. Pay a good price for
your shoe-, get them from a reputable
dealer and you may be euro of the vici
kid. But, depend upon It, you are not get
ting It in a cheap pair.
Calfskin, or box calf. Is the leather used
for walking boots. It looks well, Is easily
taken care of and when of a good quality
outwears all other leathers. It can be put
through an especial process that makes
it absolutely rain-proof.
Of the cut of boots a special edition
could be written. The photographs tell
the story better than an* pencil possibly
could. All better grade shoes are either
medium round, full round or bulldog
shape. The bulldog shape Is as doggy as
the curve can possibly make it. For It Is
by the curve that the mannish effect is
gained.
The occasion must determine the cut
and style of your boot. Time and place
are to be considered in selecting the
proper shoe. There are as strict laws
down in the ethics of fashion as to the
"do" and "don't" of shoe wearing as
there are on any other subject in fash-^^
province. _^fl

You may think these figures aro ln^
'ended for daughters of bondholders.-
But when I put the comfortable average
â number at half a dozen I mean for the
girl of average means. Exorbitant? Not
a bit, begging your pardon. Remember
that slippers are included, for lives there
a girl who does not now and then trip
the light fantastic? If such there be
even she must have some house slippers,
and that balances the account. For the
clever girl with slender means never buys
house slippers. A coat of paint or a satin
covering, and she has doctored up worn
out dancing slippers that serve house
duty.
, A tailor-made girl rustled into a car the
other day, tripped over the door sill, lost
her balance clutching for the strap and
fell pell-mell on a poor old man powerless
to defend himself.
"Look at her shoes. No wonder she
can't keep her balance," said my,dis
gusted neighbor. The tailor-made girl* was
not the genuine article after all. She. had
on a pair of thin French heeled shoes,
with razor toes. â â â ; ';-;â , ;->â¢ Ââ¢;:â ,. i. v. v;^/-
Now your bona fide tailor girl has a
better idea 1 of the eternal fitness of things.

To talk of shoes without mentioning
stockings is out of the question. ~-A stock
ing has much to do with the fit of the
shoe, and is responsible for more corns
and bunions than shoes. . )',d .; ~7'e7
It's easier to buy stockings than shoes,
but not a whit less expensive. It's money
makes the world go round and It's money
makes the world's wife a thing of beauty.
Fine stockings are expensive, but In the
long run they are more economical than
their cheaper sisters.
I say It's easier to buy stockings than
boots, for hosiery is all cut after more or
less the same pattern, while shoes are
made on countless lasts.
, To .wear siik stockings or not to wear
them is a problem that confronts the girl
. not overly burdened with golden ducats.
Silk stockings look well, fit well, but they
cost In accordance with their merits.
And, sad to tell, they don't wear very
well. â  . . V>
The dealers will tell you the con
trary, but listen to the tales of woe
of damsels who are addicted to silk
stockings. They all declare that their
silk "tockles" behave shamefully, be
coming "holy" on the slightest provoca
tion. 'MÂ£â?)
They can be mended, of course. But It
seems almost an Insult to disfigure a
pretty silk stocking with a darn that will
show, no matter how cleverly wrought.

the wall. A silk stocking keeps its shape
as long as the thread lasts.
. It Is Impossible to lay down the law of
color. Ultra refined taste prefers black
stockings. Hygienic rules recommend
white hosiery. Some choose those daintily
variegated; the extremist buys stockings
that outglow the rainbow.
Plain black stockings of finest silk, or
black stockings with open work are unde
niably pretty. The two, and even multi
colored stockings, are, many of them,
beautiful. So who shall say which to give
the preference to? Not I.- . '
Fancy stockings are made in all manner
of designs that the fertile brain of clever
designers can conceive. They come in
plaids., checks and stripes, or they are half
plaid and half check, half plain and half
striped, and in a dozen other comblna
tlons. In some it Ib the upper part that la
plain, and in others the lower. "Clocks"
are not as popular as they were.
If silk stockings must be regretfully
ruled out of the question, then buy lisle
thread hosiery. They are by no means
cheap, but they will outwear the most ex
pensive silk stockings.
Cotton stockings should be avoided as
persistently as the plague. Their cheap
ness is a snare, for they prove a delusion

For golf and cycling hosiery black'
stockings are almost Invariably selected.
Long ones extending around the calf and
up over the knee have a broad band of
fabric stitched on to represent a "cuff."
Short stockings are planned precisely the
same as those for men. extending only to

turn-down cuffs. All cuffs, real or simu

Plain gold or silver clasps, with mono

is another favorite material. Miniatures,
college pins, soldiers' buttons, all sorts of
unique odds and ends, are pressed into

The barbaric custom of wearing anklets
, has been revived, in order to find soma
place to wear a solid round bracelet of
recent faddlsm which has outgrown its
popularity. This is next. imns w ween
ing nose rings, which seems to be the
only Jewel custom which has not been
adopted in civilized countries.
The anklet Is generally of no use except
when one is wearing an outing skirt, as,
of course, It is only worn to be seen.
Sometimes, however, more than one is
worn, and their clanking announces their
presence. Others are furnished with
bangles or with little bells, which ring
out a silvery peal at every movement of
the wearer.
Just why the summer girl has started
such a fad It is hard to understand, for
she is supposed to be the least conven
tional of all girls. Only the girls with a
small, aristocratic foot will wear them.

WRITES
OF PLAYS AND
PLAYERS
THAT ARE
MAKING A
HIT IN
NEW YORK.
THERE Is no reason whatever why
a play cannot be exhilarating, spark
ling, intensely interesting, thor
oughly laughable and comical, and a
financial success withal, and yet
possess complete freedom from vulgarity.
An impression prevails among many man
tigers that unless a play have certain Im
proprieties either actually enacted or
subtly suggested it will fall to draw large
audiences. But they make a mistake.
Humorâ that glorious gift of the gods
can be revealed in "many harmless ways J
which are nevertheless pleasing and pop- i
ular. There is no necessity to dig into
-he mild of the streets for this sparkling
jewel of humor. "Stage filth" is far too
abundant, 1 ..ere are indeed many peo
ple with unclean minds who like It, but
the number Is small. Others, Indeed, I
patronize certain objectionable plays, but
it is because these plays have something
to recommend them besides their vulgari
ties. Clever acting, the fame of certain
actors, the prestige of certain theaters,
gorgeous scenery, attractive musicâ all
these cause the large audiences.
Many of these adaptations from the
French i\...cii are produced every sea
son are not only coarse but silly. Their
dullness would insure their failure were
It not for the heroic efforts of the actors
who present them. One feels a thrill of
sympathy for actors like W. J. Ferguson,
Leo Diedrlchstein, Gertrude Whltty, Eu- j
gene Jephson, Josephine Hall, Mrs. j
Rankinâ actors with ' fine talents who j
consent to appear in farces such as "The i
Turtle," or "Mile. Fill," or. "The Girl
From Maxims." I am glad that William j
Winter has the bravery to taboo this last j
farce, which is a disgrace to our stage.
I He calls it "a screed as might have been j
| written by a stableboy for the amuse
i ment of a bootbiack." He speaks of the
i vacuous audience which witnessed and
applauded the silly incidents and frivol
! ous chatter of this latest abomination
from Paris.
With what relief and refreshment of
mind one turns from these abominable
travesties of sentiment and dignity to a
farce like "A Little Ray of Sunshine."
Here is humor, here are comical situa
tions, ludicrous scenes, abundant laugh
ter, and the large audiences which
greeted the play at Wallack's encouraged
the true lover and supporter of refined
drama. In this farce there is not a line,
a situation, a gesture, a suggestion which
could offend the most critical. More!
The dialogue and situations have not the
negative quality of freedom from evil.
but the positive merit of being irradiated |
with sparkling humor, genuine, piquant i
comedy. This farce differs from the or
dinary kind in that It is not made up of ,
clever bits, loosely strung together; but
the story has coherence and sequence.
"A Little Ray of Sunshine"* furnishes a
spirited reproof to those people who In
sist that freedom from risky scenes arid
vulgar innuendo results In Insipidity and
goody-goody tras*h. A farcical comedy
like this does much to purify the stage
from the taint of grossness and cause re
fined and healthful pleasure. - That It
will have success on its tour through
different parts of trie ! United States and
Canada is a matter of certainty.
"A Little Ray of Sunshine" Is written
by two English authors, and Is presented
! by an English company. This company i
ils excellentâ not particularly brilliantâ
! but it does uniformly good work. Wil
| liam Elton Is no stranger here, for he
j won distinction years ago. Ho Is a
! natural comedian of Irresistible drollery,
, with a sure hold upon pathos, as well as
humor. He takes the part of an eccentric
| nobleman who has been absent from
I England for a number of years, grown
| rich and has returned to his home to find
; that his relatives do not know him and
that some of them are in pecuniary dis
| tress. Many amusing complications arise
I because he Is taken for several different
; persons In 'turn. He conceals his Identity,
I and with boyish unction and spirit he In
volves his friends in great perplexity,
finds out seme very Important things and
brings happiness and Joy to all In the
end. The last act has few of the drol
! leries and laughable absurdities of the
other acts, but Mr. Elton, In his narra
tive at the end, shows in a beautiful and
tender way the close union which exists
between humor and pathos. A tear
trembles on the eyelid of every jest, says
the Spanish proverb. Mr. Elton's Jests
| have large eyelids and well-rounded i
I tears.
The honors of the representation of "A
Little Ray of Sunshine" rest of course
with Mr. Elton, but Oeore-e Riddle, who
take** the part of Old Saunde.i. the butler, I
Is especially to bo commended for his
naturalness.. Wallace Ersklne as the
young squire, and Grace Dudley, who Is
the squire's sister, do vivacious, skillful
work. In the presentation of a play like
this there Is no degradation of the actors
or of the high calling they profess. The
healthfulness of It all Is refreshing to
them as well as to the public to whose
amusement they minister.
"Miss Hobbs" is a refined as well as
clever and Interesting comedy. An ac
complished dramatic critic of the New
! York Sun said the other day: "The play
] Is charming from the first line to the last
j and deserves more success than It will
I probably attain." The public at present
Is so taken up with unclean farces utterly
' devoid of humor in most cases that It
i will overlook a piece which Is pure and
clever ln Its rush after the so-termod
sensational. This is unjust to the New
York public, and the public Is dally fur
nishing a refutation of the assertion.
Every night the cozy, homelike Lyceum
is filled by enthusiastic, appreciative audi
ences. â¢ The success of "Miss Hobbs"
seems assured and the play will be seen
at the Lyceum for some time. The play's
the thing, but the acting Is also the
thing. And much of this success must
be attributed to Miss Russell and her able
company. Bad acting has killed many a
good play, arid good acting has carried
1 many a bad play. Given a good play and
good acting together and the combina
| tion Is an artistic delight. The play at
' the Lyceum has been written by Jerome
IK. Jerome and ln his best style. The
dialogue Is witty and the story Ingenious.
; Miss Hobbs Is a new woman full of ridic
-1 ulous theories In regard to marriage. She
I has an exaggerated , Idea of man's bad
â¢ ness and an exalted idea of woman's
1 goodness. Put instead of being old and
i ; plain with cork-screw curls and wrinkles,
j an angular figure, a cracked voice and
| squinting eyes, she Is young and fair,
! graceful and gentle, endowed with social
resources, has a sweet, low voice, and
tender, gracious manners. When one says
that Annie i.UÃ_**!l is Miss Hobbs, then all.
this Is said. Miss Russell is distinguished'
â  for her brightness and archness, her ;
charming simplicity and naturalness and â¢
her power of expressing pathetic emotion.
' She Is so sweet and gentle that she could
not make Miss Hobbs terrible if she tried.
', Fortunately she does not try, and Miss
! Hobbs does net demand that she should.
; Before her i first entrance a sufficiently
i hideous Impression Is conveyed of her un
| lovely characteristics, and. one of the in-
I terests of the play Is that the men who
1 have this false Impression of the strong
minded woman are very much surprised
I when they see how charming and lovely

â¢ ter's reply was amiable in tone. "You are a damned bleating little
kid and you made a holy show of yourself before Mr. Gordner. There's
where you stand. Didn't you see that he turned us out because he didn't
know but what you were going to blubber or something? You are a
sucking pip. and If you want to know how I find out things go ask the
Delphic Oracle, you blind ass."
"You better look out or you may get a punch in the eye!"
"You take one punch in the general direction of my eye, me son," said
Peter cheerfully, "and I'll distribute your remains over this hotel In a
way that will cause your friends years of trouble to collect you. Instead
of anticipating an attack upon my eye, you had much better be engaged
in Improving 'your mind, which is at present not .-i fit machine to cope
with exciting situations. There's Coke! Hello, Coke; hear the news?
Well. Marjory Wainwright and Rufus Coleman are engaged. Straight?
Certainly! Go ask the Minister."
Coke did not take Peter's word. "Is that so?" he asked the others.
"So the Minister told us," they answered, and then these two, who
eeemed so unhapr-v. watched Coke's face to see If they could not find sur
prised misery there. But Coke coolly aid, "Well. then, I suppose it's
true."
It soon became evident that the. students did not care for each others
society. Peter Toun'.ev was probably an exception, but the others seemed
to long for quiet corners. They were distrusting each other, and in a
boyish way they were even able of malignant things. Their excuses
for separation were badly made.
"Iâ l think I"! go for a walk."
"I'm uoing m.stairs to rend."
"Well so lone;, old man." "So long." There was no heart to It.
Peter Tounlcy went to Coleman's door, where he knocked with noisy
hilarity. Tome In!' The correspondent apparently had just come from
the street, for his hat was on his head and a light top coat was on his
back. He was searching hurriedly through some papers. "Hello, you
young devil. What are you doing here?"
Peter's entrance was a somewhat elaborate comedy which Coleman
watched in icy silence. Peter, after a long and impudent pantomime,
halted abruptly and fixing Coleman with his eye demanded, "Well?"
"Wellâ what?" said Coleman bristling a trifle.
"Is It true?" ;
"Is what true?"
"Is It true?" Peter was extremely solemn.
"Say, me bucko," said Coleman suddenly, "If you've come up here to
twist the beard of the patriarch, don't you think you 'are running a

"Is what true?"
"What the whole hotel is saying."
"1 haven't heard the hotel making any remarks lately. Been talking to
the other buildings, 1 suppose."
"Well, I want to tell you that everybody knows that you and Marjory
have done gone and got yourselves engaged," said Peter bluntly.
"And well?" asked Coleman imperturbably.
"Oh, nothing." replied Peter, waving his hand. "Onlyâ thought It
might interest you."
Coleman was silent for some time. He fingered his papers. At last he
burst out joyously. "And so they know It already, do they? Wellâ damn
themâ let them know it. But you didn't tell them yourself?"
"I?" quoth Peter wrathful!}-. "No! The Minister told us."
Then Coleman was again silent for a time and Peter Tounley sat on
the bed reflectively looking at thu celling. "Funny thing. Marjory 'way
H:r here In Greece ar.d then you happening over here the way you did.
"It isn't funny at all."
"Why Isn't if.'" Â»
"Because." said Coleman impressively, "that Is why I came to Greece.
It was all planned. See?"
"Whin exclaimed Peter. "This here is magic."
"No magic at all." Coleman displayed some complacence. "No maglo
at all. Just pure, plainâ whatever you choose to call It."
"Holy smoke." said Peter, admiring the situation. "Why, this Is
plum romance. Coleman. I'm blowed if ii Isn't."
Coleman was grinning with delight. Hi took a fresh cigar and his
bright eyes looked at Peter through the smoke. "Seems like It, don't it?
Yes. Regular romance. Have a drink, my boy, just to celebrate my good
luck. And be patient If I talk a great deal of myâ myâ future. My head
-=pins with it." He arose to pace the room, Ringing out his arms in a great
gesture. -'God! When I think yesterday was not like to-day I wonder lmv
I stood It." There was a knock at the door and a waiter left a note h
Coleman's I and. *Â«_â¢__

\\ ith a radiant face Coleman gave the note a little crackling flourish
in the air. "Oh, you don't know what life is, kid."
"S-steady the Blues," said Peter Tounley seriously. "You'll lose your
head if you don't watch out."
"Not I," cried Cole-man, with irritation. "But a man must turn lose
sometimes, mustn't he?"
When the four students had separated In the corridor Coke had Dosted
at ence to Nora Black's sitting room. His entrance was somewhat precipi
tate, but he cooled down almost at once, for he reflected that he was not
bearing good news. He ended by perching in awkward fashion on the
brink of his chair and tumbling his hat uneasily. Nora floated to him In a
cloud of a white dreistng gown. She gave him a plump hand "Well
young man?" she said, with a glowing smile. She took a chair and tho
stuff of her gown fell ln curves over the arms of It.
Coke looked hot and bothered, as if he could have more than half
wanted to retract his visit. "Iâ we haven't seen much of you lately
he began, sparring. He had expected to tell his news at once.
"No," said Nora languidly. "I have been resting after that horrible
Journeyâ that horrible journey. Dear, dear! Nothing will ever Induce me
to leave London. New York and Paris. 1 am at home there. But here'
Why. it is worse than living in Brooklyn. And that Journey Into the wilds'
No, no; not for me!"
"I suppose we'll all be glad to get home." said Coke, aimlessly.
At the moment a waiter entered the room and began to lay the table
for luncheon. He kept open the door to the corridor, and he had the
luncheon at a point just outside the door. His excursions to the trays
were flying ones, so that, as far as Coke's purpose t was concerned the
waiter was always In the room. Moreover, Coke was obliged naturally to
depart at once, He had bungled everything.
As he arose he whispered hastily, "Does this waiter understand Enjr
llsh?" .';â¢ .
"Yes." answered Nora. "Why?"
"Because I have something to tell youâ lmportant."
"What is It?" whispered Nora eagerly.
He leaned toward her and replied, "Marjory Wainwright and Coleman
are engaged. ..- : .â â 
To his unfeigned astonishment Nora Black burst Into peals of silvery
laughter. "Oh, indeed? And so this Is your tragic story, poor innocent
lambkin? Amd what did you expect? That I would faint?" '"noceni
"I thoughtâ l dpn't knowâ" murmured Coke In confusion.
Nora became suddenly businesslike. "But how do you know' Are you

Oh, you must." r*
Coke dropped again Into his chair. He studied her in some wonder "I
thoui i.t you d be surprised," he said, ingenuously.
"Oh. you did, did you? Well, you see I'm not. And now tell me all
' about It."
"There's really nothing to tell but the plain fact. Some of the boys
dropped in at f the Minister's rooms a little while ago and he told them of

"Well, how did he know?"
"I am sure I can't tell you. Got It first hand, I suppose He like* rr>*Â»

At his departure Nora turned and called Into an adjoining room.

"The Prince. The Prince. Can't you understand? I mean the Prince"
" 'Marco'!" again quoted the old lady under her breath.
"Yes, 'Marco.' " cried Nora, belligerently. " 'Marco,' Do you object
to the name? What's the matter with you. anyhow?"
"Well." rejoined the other, nodding her head wisely, "he may be a
Prince, but I've always heard that these continental titles are no good in
comparison to the -dish titles."
"Yes, but who told you so. eh?" demanded Nora, noisllv. She herself
answered the quc-nicn. "The English!"
"Anyhow, that little Marquis who tagged after you In London is a
much bigger man In every way, I'll bet, than this little Prince of yours."
"Butâ good heavensâ he didn't mean it. Why, he was only one of the
regular rounders. But Marco, he is serious! He means it. He'd go
through fire and water for me and be glad of the chance."'
"Well," proclaimed the old lady, "If you are not the strangest woman
In the world, I'd like to know! Here I thoughtâ"
"What did you think?" demanded Nora, suspiciously.
"1 thought that Coleman " â¢<â  â : â¢_;.
"Bosh!" Interrupted the graceful Nora. "I tell you what, Maude;
you'd better try to think as little as possible. It will suit your style of
beauty better. And above all, don't think of my affairs. I myself am tak
ing pains not to think of them. It's easier."

Mrs. Wainwright, with no spirit of Intention whatever, had set about
readjusting her opinions. It Is certain that she was unconscious of any
evolution, If some one had said to her that she was surrendering to the
inevitable she would have been immediately on her guard and would have
opposed forever all suggestions of a match between Marjory and Cole
man. On the other hand, If some one had said to her that her daughter
was going to marry a human serpent and that there were people ln
Athens who would be glad to explain his treacherous character she would
have haughtily scorned the tale-bearing and would have gonel with more
haste Into the professor's way of thinking. In fact, she was in process of
undermining herself, and the work could have been retarded or advanced
by any Irresponsible, gossipy tongue.
The professor, from the depths of his experience with her, arranged a
course of conduct. "If I Just leave her to herself she will come around all
right, but if I go 'striking while the iron Is hot,' or any of those things,
I'll bungle it surely."
As they were making ready to go down to luncheon Mrs. Wainwright
made a speech which first indicated a changing mind. "Well, what will
be. will be." she murmured with a prolonged sigh of resignation. "What
will be, will be. Girls are very headstrong In these days, and there Is
nothing much to be done with them. They go their own roads. It wasn't
so In my girlhood. We were obliged to pay attention to our mothers'
wishes."
"I did not notice that you paid much attention to your mother's wishes
when you married me," remarked the professor. "In fact, I thoughtâ"
"That was another thing," retorted Mrs. Wainwright with severity.
"You were a steady young man who had taken the highest honors all
through your college course, and my mother's sole objection was that we
were too hasty. She thought we ought to wait until you had a penny to
bless yourself with, and I can see now where she was quite right." .â -. -..; â¢Â«;
"Well, you married me, anyhow," said the professor victoriously.
Mrs. Wainwright allowed her husband's retort to pass over her
thoughtful mood. "They say â¢ â¢ they say Rufus Coleman makes as
much as fifteen thousand dollars a year. That's more than three times
your Income. â¢ â¢ I don't know. â¢ â¢ It all depends on whether they try
to save or not. His manner of life Is, no doubt, very luxurious. I don't
suppose he knows how to economize at all. That kind of a man usually
doesn't. And then, ln the newspaper world positions are so very pre
carious. Men may have valuable positions one minute and be penniless
ln the street the next minute. It Isn't as If he had any real income, and
,of course he has no real ability. If he was suddenly thrown out of his
position, goodness knows what would become of him. Still * â¢ still â¢ â¢
fifteen thousand dollars a year is a big Income â¢ * while It lasts. I sup
pose he Is very extravagant. That kind of a man usually is. And I
wouldn't be surprised if he was heavily In debt; very heavily in debt. Still
â¢ â¢ If Marjory has set her heart there Is nothing to be done, I suppose.
It wouldn't have happened If you had been as wise as you thought you
were. â¢ * I suppose he thinks I have been very rude to him. Well, some
times I wasn't nearly so rude as I felt like being. Feeling as I did, I could
hardly be very amiable. â¢ * Of course this drive this afternoon was all
your affair and Marjory's. But of course I shall be nice to him."
"And what of all this Nora Black business?" asked the professor, with
a display of .valor, but really with much trepidation.
"She Is a hussy," responded Mrs. Wainwright with energy. "Her con
versation ln the carriage on the way down to Agrinlon sickened mo!"
"I really believe that her plan was simply to break everything off be
tween Marjory and Coleman,"- Bald the professor,. "and I don't believe she

"Of course she didn't." asserted Mrs. Wainwright "The vicious thing!"
"On the other hand," said the professor, "there might be some truth
in It.
"I don't think so," said Mrs. Wainwright seriously. "I don't believe a
word of It." . .*

"Well, money is money and poverty is poverty," interrupted his wife.
"You don't have to be very learned to know that."
"I do not say that Coleman has not a very nice thing of It, but I must
Bay it is hard to think of his getting any such sum as you'mention." '
"Isn't he known as a most brilliant Journalist In New York?" she de
manded harshly.
"Y-yes, as long as It lasts, but then one never knows when he will be
out in the|_treet penniless. Of course he has no particular ability which
would be marketable If he suddenly lost his present employment. Of
course It Is not as If he was a really talented young man. He might not
be able to make his way at all in any new direction."
"I don't know about that." said Mrs. Wainwright ln reflective protesta
tion. "I don't know about that. I think he would." .;.-.
"I thought you said a moment ago The professor spoke with an
air of puzzled hesitancy.. "I thought you* said a moment ago that he
wouldnt succeed in anything but journalism?"
Mrs. Wainwright swam over the situation with a fine tranquillity.
"Well-1-1," she answered musingly, "if I did say that, I didn't mean It
exactly."
"No, I suppose not," spoke the professor, and despite the necessity for
caution he could not keep out of his voice a faint not of annoyance.
"Of course," continued the wife, "Rufus Coleman is known everywhere
as a brilliant man, a very brilliant man, and ha even might do well lnâ
politics or something of that sort."
"I have a very poor opinion of that kind of a mind which does well in
American politics," said the professor, speaking as a collegian, "but I sup
pose there may be something ln it."
"Well, at any rate," decided Mrs. Wainwright. "At any rateâ"
â  At that moment Marjory, attired for luncheon and the drive, entered
from her room, and Mrs. Wainwright checked the expression of her im
portant conclusion. Neither father nor mother had ever seen her so glow
ing with triumphant beauty, a beauty which would carry the mind of a
spectator far above physical appreciation into that realm of poetry where
creatures of light move and are beautiful because they cannot know pain
or a burden. It carried tears to the old father's eyes. He took her hands.
'.'Don't be too happy, my child; don't be too happy." he admonished her
tremulously. "It makes me afraidâ it makes me afraid."
CHAPTER XXXI. '. ,'>
It seems strange that the one who was the most hilarious over the en
gagement of Marjory and Coleman should be Coleman's dragoman, who
was indeed in a state bordering on transport. '- It is not known how he
learned the glad tidings, but it Is certain that he learned them before
luncheon. He told all the visible employes of the hotel and allowed them
to know that the betrothal really had been his handiwork. He had ar
ranged It. He did not make quite clear how he had performed this feat
but at last he was perfectly frank ln acknowledging it.
When some of the students came down to luncheon they saw him but
could not decide what ailed him. He was in the main corridor of" the
hotel, grinning from ear to ear. and when he perceived the students he
made signs to Intimate that they possessed in common a joyous secret
"What's the matter with that Idiot?" asked Coke morosely. "Looks as If
his wheels were going around too fast,"
Peter Tounley walked close to him and scanned him imperturbablv
but with care. "What's up, Phidias?" The man made no articulate reply
He continued to grin and gesture. "Pain In 00. tummy? Mother dead'
Caught the cholera? Found out that you've swallowed a pair of ham
mered brass andirons in -your beer? Say, who are you, anyhow?" But ha
could not shake this Invincible glee, so he went away.
The dragoman's rapture reached Its zenith when Coleman lent him to
the professor and he was commissioned to bring a carriage for four neoDlo
to the door at 3 o'clock. He himself was to sit on the box and tell the
driver what was required of him. He dashed off, bis hat ln his hand his
hair flying, puffing, important beyond everything, and apparently babbling
his mission to half the people he met on the street. In most countries he
would have landed speedily in jail, but among a people who exist on a
basis of gibbering his violent gabble aroused no suspicions as to his sanity.
However, he stirred several livery stables to depths Â«*.â Â«*â Â»Â«
running here and there wildly and for the most part â¢tllely.
At fifteen minutes to 8 o'clock a carriage with Its horses on a gull op
tore around the corner and up to the front of the hoteL wherelt nsitea
with the pomp and excitement of a fire engine. The Â£â¢goman jumped
down from his seat beside the driver and scrambled hurriedly into the
hotel, ln the gloom of which he met a serene stillness which was punctu
ated only by the leisurely tinkle of silver and glass in the dining: room.
For a moment the dragoman seemed really astounded out of speech. Then
ne plunged Into the manager's room. Was It conceivable that Monsieur
â¢ Coleman was still at luncheon? Yes; in fact, It was true. But the car
riage was at the door! The manager, undisturbed, asked for what hour
Monsieur Coleman had been pleased to order a carriage. Three o'clockl
Three o'clock? The manager pointed calmly at the clock. Very well. It
â¢was now only thirteen minutes of 3 o'clock. Monsieur Coleman doubtless
would appear at 3. Until that hour the manager would not disturb Mon
sieur Coleman. The dragoman clutched both his hands in his hair and
cast a look of agony to the ceiling. Great God! Had he accomplished the
herculean task, of getting a carriage for four people to the door of the
hotel in time for a drive at 3 o'clock, only to meet with stonincss, this in
humanity? Ah, it was unendurable! He begged the manager; he Implored
him. But at every word the manager seemed to grow more indifferent, more
callous. He pointed with a wooden finger at the clock's face. In reality
It Is thus that Greek meets Greek.
Professor Wainwright and Coleman strolled together out of the dining
room. The dragoman rushed ecstatically upon the correspondent. "Oh,
Meester Coleman! The carge is ready!"
"Well, all right." said Coleman, knocking ashes from his cigar. "Don't
be In a hurry. I suppose we'll be ready presently." The man was ln de
spair.
The departure of the Walnwrights and Coleman on this ordinary drive
was of a somewhat dramatic and public nature. No one seemed to know
how to prevent its being so. in the first place, the attendants thronged
out en masse for a reason which was plain at the time only to Coleman's
dragoman. And, rather ln the background, lurked the interested students
The professor was surprised and nervous. Coleman was rigid and angry"
Marjory was flushed and somewhat hurried, and Mrs. Wainwright was as
proud as an old turkey hen.
As the carriage rolled away Peter Tounley turned to his companion*
and said: "Now, that's official! That is the official announcement! Did
you see Old Mother Wainwright? Oh, my eye. wasn't she puffed up! Say
what in h do you suppose all these jay-hawking bellboys poured out to
the kerb for? Go back to your cages, my good people â "
As soon as the carriage wheeled into another street its occupants ex
changed easier smiles, and they must have confessed in some subtle way
of glances that now at last they were upon their own mission, a mission
undefined but earnest to them all. Coleman had a glad feeling of being
let into the family, or becoming one of them. Â°
. The professor looked sideways at him and smiled gently. "You know
I thought of driving you to some ruins, but Marjory would not have It!
She flatly objected to any more ruins. So I thought we would drive down
to New Phalerum." - :,:
Coleman nodded and smiled as If he were Immensely pleased, but of
course New Phalerum was to him no more nor less than Vladivostok or
Khartoum. Neither place nor distance had Interest for him. They swept
along a shaded avenue where the dust lay thick on the leaves; they passed
cafes where crowds were angrily shouting over the news in the little pa
pers; they passed a hospital before which wounded men, white with
bandages, were taking the sun; then came soon to the arid valley flanked
by gaunt, naked mountains, which would lead them to the sea. Sometimes
to accentuate the dry nakedness of this valley there would be a patch of
grass upon which poppies burned crimson spots. The dust writhed out
from under the wheels of the carriage; in the distance the sea appeared a
blue half-disk set between shoulders of barren land. It would be common
to say that Coleman was oblivious to all about him but Marjory*. On the
contrary, the parched land, the isolated flame of popples, the cool air from
the sea, all were keenly known to him. and they had developed an extraor
dinary power of blending sympathetically into his mood. Meanwhile the
professor talked a great deal. And as a somewhat exhilarating detail
Coleman perceived that Mrs. Wainwright was beaming upon him
At New Phalerumâ a small collection of pale square villasâ they left tha
carriage and strolled by the sea. The waves were snarling together Ilka
wolves amid the honeycomb rocks and from where the blue plain spran_
level to the horizon came a strong cold breeze, the kind of a breeze which
moves an exulting man or a person to take off his hat and let his locVa
flutter and tug back from his brow. '-j<-k_
The professor and Mrs. Wainwright were left to themselves
Marjory and Coleman did not speak for a time. It might have heen
that they did not quite know where to make a beginning. At last Marlorv
asked. "What has become of your splendid horse?" J *

plainly that they had not come to this place to talk about a horsa.
Thereat he made speech of matters which at least did not afford as many
opportunities for coherency as would the horse. "Marjory, It can't be

Rules for Relishes.
Always use the best of fruit and veg
etables; pure cider vinegar and pure
spices, and every utensil used in the mak
ing should bo of granite earthenware,
stone or glass. Never under any condi
tions use tin.
Boiling vinegar too much takes away its
Etrength. Just bring the pickle to a boll,
never allowing It to boil, and if a sharp
pickle Is desired repeat until the fruit is
tender and all the water extra*
Handle all pickles as little as possible.
Glass bottles and jars are better in every
way for pickles, though some pickles keep
well in stone.
In making catsups stir only occasion
ally unti the last hour of cooking, then
stir almost constantly.
Put catsups ln common beer bottles or
pint sized fruit Jars. Preferably, beer bot
tles with rubber corks, as they are more
convenient.
After putting Jars of pickles away for
the winter look at them every now and
then in order to keep them entirely cov
ered with vinegar. Otherwise they will
spoil. Also keep them in a cool, dark
cioset.
The spices used In pickling is simply a
matter of taste. Ginger is one of the most
wholesome Ices, cloves the strongest
and next In line allspice, cinnamon and
mace.
If mustard seed is used it must be fresh,
as It becomes better with age.
Cardamom coriander and fennel seeds
each have warm, aromatic flavors and
add a great deal to some relishes. _ ' . r

STAIR CARPETSâ The carpet at the
edge of each step is the first to wear out.
If padding or cotton batting Is tacked to
tho edge fore the carpet Is laid It will
wear much longer.
CLEANING BRASS OR COPPERâ
one pint of alcohol add one ounce of ox
alic acid, a little silver polish' and th*"
shavings of one candle. Allow to stand
until dissolved and then apply with a soft
cloth, rubbing off with a soft woolen
cloth.
TO CLEAN WHITE FURâ Heat some
bran, scatter on fur and rub with a clean
woolen cloth. Be sure the bran Is heated
in a slow oven. If It is brown the fur wll!
become brown. Heated flour does almost
as well as the bran.
TO MEND ORIENTAL RUGSâ Oriental
rugs, curtains and couch covers, particu
larly the latter, soon need mending.
First study the stitch and then get yarns
of the various shades. If the place to be
mended is but slightly worn work with
the In-and-out stitch, the darning stitch,
but if there is a hole and clearly detinea
tear, baste on the under side a piece of
burlap and into it work the different
colors and If possible the designs used in
th" rug.
CHEESECLOTHâ A plentiful supply of
cheesecloth should always be kept on
hand. It is a great saver of time, as it
washes so easily. Not only for dusters
and windows should it be used, but for
the cleaning of meats and poultry. The
line quality for dusting and window
cleaning and the coarse for the kitchen.
TO FILTER DRINKING WATERâ The
objection to filters is that they must be
cleaned every few days, otherwise the
water would be passing through decaying
matter. The simplest and a better way
if to use a flannel bag on the faucet. It
acts merely as a strainer, but is quite as
desirable as the filter, neither one re
moving any impurity which has been dis
solved in the water. If this is to be done,
boil the water; it is the only sure way.
TORN LEAVES OF BOOKSâ be
repaired with the blank edges of postage
stamps. Carefully bring the edges to

SINKS AND DRAINS require special
attention. Once a week a strong solution
of caustic potash should be dissolved in
water and poured down the sink. At night
Is the best time, as it allows the pipe to
be thoroughly cleansed. Chloride of lime
Is an excellent disinfectant, but not so
good as copperas. Copperas Is deadly poi
son and should be carefully used. When
using it. pour over boiling water and then
flush. It should be used often, particu
late If there is Illness In the family.

THE SUNDAY CALL.
Qame.
Now, just listen to a bit of advice. If
on Saturday the financial side of the house
tells you In a boy-in-his-flrst-pair-of
trousers tone of voice "to never mind get
ting game for Sunday dinner, "going
shooting," and so forth and so on, don't
you pay any attention; get the game. It's
all a pipe dream. Of course, It's only nat
ural that "dear Bob" is the best shot in
the State, but ducks and other game have
such a happy faculty of moving with the
weather or to some unknown grain field,
or will insist on flying high; and then so
many arc lost or chewed up by a well
trained dog. Now, it's all very well to
talk, but eating and talking are only
slangily synonymous, "stuffing and fill
ing," and a game course with tales of
"almost got" instead of gameâ bona fide
is "stuffing" without the "filling."
Men are as yet not perfected in the art
of telling small fibs truthfully, but were
they given half a chance by longer "open
seasons" ours would be a race of accom
plished liars.

J^ "Well, really, I have lived
those exciting scenes over again
many a time. I can never sweep them
quite out of my memory."
Tell me, then," I asked, "why did you
go to Manila?"
**I went to Manila expecting to be a
nurse in the hospital. My son had gone

filling of a lifelong ambitionâ be a
'nurse .among the soldiers."
As she talked and lived over again her

pretty expressive face and wondered. I
Wondered how this dear little woman,
.whose great, big motherly heart would
make her eyes overflow as she told about
those poor, suffering fellows, stood all
the pain and misery she saw. Dainty,

With the full hospital corps. Fresh water,
a nice chair cloth, a bottle of Florida
water and some malted milk I always
carried with me. I could not do so very
muchâ just wash their faces in the sweet,
cool water; feed them and mother them
and pet them, and they did need it so
sadly. Sometimes when they felt the cool
oloth on their faces they would open their
eyes ln astonishment, knowing It was a
woman's touch, and smileâ smile up Into
my face when their suffering was so in

poor fellow I shall never forget as long
as I live. He had been shot through the
stomach and was dying; the doctors had
done their best tor him and gone. I sat
down beside him, put his head on my lap
and bathed his face. Death was very
near, so near that he could hardly speak;
but he opened his eyes, smiled and ln the
moot pathetic way said, 'Oh â oh â oh!' I
held him until he died."
Mrs. Boysen's eyes were full of tears,

"Tell me about your first experience on
the firing lineâ very first,' I said.
"I certainly have cause to remember my
first time out. It was there I had a very
narrow escape and there that General
Wheaton complimented me on my brav

and waiting for the wounded to be
brought in. We could hear the firing in
the trenches, but thought ourselves in no
danger.. I stepped away from the man I
had been talking to, and as I did so he
stepped Into my place. I was hardly two
feet away from him, when bullets came
thick and fast. He was struck and had
his leg broken in two places. For an in
stant I was terribly frightened, stunned
by the suddenness of it all, but soon re
gained my composure and never felt the
least fear after that."
"Was that the only narrow escape you
had?"
"No; one other that I know of. but then
you can hardly call it an escape, as we
never discovered whether the shot was

That We^e Realized

THERE is a class of people who be

and auguries of the future. On the
opposite side there is a class who
believe that dreams are the discon-
nected fragments of the day's
thoughts tossed brokenly and confusedly
upon the shores of sleep. Still another
class believe that dreams are often caused
by the action of one mind upon another
at a distance, or are produced by what Is
known as clairvoyance.
A most remarkable dream proving the

gentleman of standing and veracity, and
still more fortunately for the adherents
of the theory his story is corroborated
by a score of witnesses whose testimony
is conclusive and uncontradicted.
During the administration of President
Cleveland, W. R. Branch, a brother
of Clerk Branch, was acting as Ameri

day Clerk Branch received a letter from
him stating that he expected to remain
at his post for three years longer. The
letter had been several weeks on the way
when received, and on the same night
George Branch dreamed that he saw his
brother at Apia taking passage on a

"Not in the least. >r
We were all so busy I never thought of
being frightened; and, then, one can even
get used to bullets flying around, and take
so vividâ fact so much more vivid
than any he had ever before experienced,
that it made c deep impression on his
mind, and he jotted down the dream and
its date on paper. After a sufficient
length of time had elapsed for the
schooner to have arrived at Honolulu, Mr.
Branch had another realistic vision. He
saw- his brother going on board a large
steamer at Honolulu, and he saw also
that his brother was coming home to S:.n
Francisco. This dream and its date were
jotted down in black and white and re
lated by Mr. Branch to his friends. On
consulting the steamer schedule It was
found that a steamer from China to this
city was due at Honolulu at the date of
the dream, and this discovery was all
that was necessary to convince Mr.
Branch that the vision was worth heed
ing. He made all bis arrangements to
receive his brother on the arrival of the
steamer and had Ellis Holmes, Inspector
of Customs, at the gangplank to search
and pass upon his brother's baggage, so
that there might be no unnecessary de
lay in landing the expected visitor.
'Clerk Branch had a fine dinner pre

wharf as the steamer arrived. What was

"You see that cartridge belt? It was
after thai battle that I fed _ poor fellow
when among the - first persons to step
down the gangplank was the brother of
the man who dreamed. He was more as
tonished than the people who received
him, and could hardly believe that his
coming had been heralded in so remarka
ble a manner, but tin- hack and the din
ner and the throng of expectant friends
on the dock convinced him that dreams
are sometimes made of tangible stuff.
Samoa is about four thousand miles
from this citj", and there is no cable or
other communication between Samoa and
the rest of the world save steamers and

for any one in San Francisco to learn of
Vice Consul Branch's change of fortune
or of intention. At the time he wrote his

had not the remotest idea that he was
about to have Apia, and he was sched
uled to remain there at his post for three
years longer, This change of plan came
about only a short time before a schooner
was to start for Honolulu, and he there
fore did not write announcing his inten
tion of returning. He was congratulating
himself all throughout the voyage on the
fact that he would give his relatives a
genuine surprise, and the result was that
he was the most surprised person In the
lot.
The only rational explanations that have
been suggested for this strange adventure
Is that the mind of the sleeper, being
passive, received the suggestion from the
mind of his brother over 4000 miles of
water by what has been called ".telepathy'
or that the soul of the sleeper berime
clairvoyant and went forth over the waste
of waters to the tropic isle and the
brother of whom he had been thinking in
his waking hours. Either of these theo
ries would lit the conditions.
Another Incident, equally as remarkable
and equally as well authenticated, is
vouched for by Benjamin F. Small, assist
ant cashier in the Custom-house. Mr.
Small bandies all the gold received in the
Custom-house for duties paid in on hie
arrival of every steamer from the Orient,
and on every ship from the great marts
of the world. The system of bookkeep
ing is so systematic tnat a failure of the
cash to balance at the end of a day's
business is something almost unheard of.
But the impossible happened to Mr. Small
at the close of a very busy day. He found
a shortage of $40 in his cash. He worked
on the books until 1 o'clock ln the morn
Dickens Died
From Overwork
Charles Dickens, son of the great nov
elist, tells how recklessly his â â  father
killed himself by giving public readings.
"There was something of almost will
ful exaggeration," he says, "of a defiance
of any possible overfatigue, either of
mind or body, In the feverish sort of en
ergy with which these readings were en
tered upon and carried out." It would
almost seem that he might have been
living and writing novels to this day if
he had not persisted ln spite of all warn
ings In giving public readings, which ex
hausted his strength and Ultimately killed
him.
"Among other serious symptoms he no
ticed that he could read only the halves
of the letters over the shop doors on his
right. The old elasticity was impaired,
the old unflagging vigor often faltered.
One night at the St. James' Hall I re
member he found It Impossible to say
Pickwick, and called it Pickswick and
Picnic and Peckwicks and all sorts of
names except the right, with a comical
glance of surprise at the occupants of
he front seats, which always were re
served for his family and friends. In
fact, when my father described himself,
in a letter written to Mr. Dolby on the
eve of the breakdown, as being 'a little
out of sorts--/ he was, ln fact, on the
brink of an attack of paralysis of the
left side, and probably of apoplexy."
What finished him was a farewell se
ries of twelve readings at St. James' Hall.
"I have had some steps put up against
the side of the platform, Charley, said
Mr. Beard, who was constantly In at
tendance. "You must be there every
night, and If you see your father falter
in the least, you must run up and catch
him and bring him off with you, or, by
heavens, he'll die before them all."
p^p>^^* s<v '
he
_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_B was wounded in
the back and could not
move. He had had nothing to eat since
the day before. When he got well he
sent mc his belt. I have It full of bullets
ing in the endeavor to locate the leak, but
without obtaining the slightest clew to
the missing money, and he paid it into the
treasury out of his own pocket. For two
(lays afterward he spent all his spare time
in seeking the lost $40, but all his effort
was in vain. He went to sleep that night
with the conviction that the money was
lost to him forever, and he made up his
mind that he would not worry about the
affair any longer. That night he dreamed
tha:<\V. P. Grace _ Co. had the missing
money. He dreamed also that he went to
the office of that firm and that a man
came up to the desk at which he stjod
and handed him the $40.
The most realistic feature of the dream
was the strong impression made upon him
by the appearance of the office of the
Arm, the arrangement of the desks and
other fixtures, and he determined when
he awoke that he would visit the office of
the firm, and that if his dream had pic
tured truly the arrangement of the fix
tures he would ask for the money. He
had never been in the office; he was not
acquainted with any member of the firm
ana he did not know where the office was.
So that his dream could not have been a
revived* memory of a place that he had
once seen.
The next clay, after he had looked into
the city directory to ascertain the street
and number of the office of W. P. Grace
& Co.. he paid a visit to the office, and he
had no sooner stepped within the door
than he saw his dream verified in its
every detail, even to the appearance of
the clerk who stepped up to the counter
to wait upon him. Mr. Small told the
story ol the shortage, giving the date, and
asked the clerk to look in the cash book
and see whether the firm was not $40 over
cash on thai date. The clerk said that it
was not necessary to look, for he remem-
red that there was $40 too much money
In the cash on that date and that they
had been unable to place it.
The money was paid over to Mr. Small
without further question, and as he
dropped the coin into his pocket he real
ized that his dream had materialized into
reality.
On returning to the Custom-house he
found that $10 that had been paid in' by
another firm had been Inadvertently cred
ited to W. P. Grace & Co., and that when
settling up the latter firm's account that
sum had been paid to their messenger.
. Was Mr. Small's dream an instance of
telepatny or of clairvoyance?
[Just When the t
Century Ends
The nineteenth century closes with the
year 1900. Immediately after midnight,
therefore, of December 31, 1900. is when
the twentieth century begins. In other
words, it begins with ,the first second of
the first hour of the 'first day of Janu
ary, 1901.
The twentieth century will open on a
Tuesday and close on a Sunday. It will
have the greatest number of leap years
possible for a centuryâ twenty-four. The
year 1904 will be the flrst one, then every
fourth year after that to and Including
the year 2000. February will three times
have Aye Sundays; in 1920, 1948 and 1976.
The twentieth century will contain 36,525
days, which lacks 'but one day of being
exactly 5218 weeks. The middle day of the
century will be January 1, 1951.
Several announcements are made of
changes to be inaugurated with the open
ing of the new century. The flrst of im
portance Is that Russia will adopt the
Gregorian calendar. This will be done by
omitting thirteen days, the amount of er
ror that will have accumulated after the
close of February. 1900. The Russians
will then write January 1. 1901, instead of
December 19, 1900; or. rather, instead of
both, according to the dual system now
in vogue in that country and in Greece.
The other Important announcement is
that it is not at all unlikely that the as
tronomical day, which now begins at noon
of the civil day, win begin with the civil
day at midnight. The present method of
having the astronomical day begin
twelve hours after the beginning of the
civil day is apt to be confusing. On the
other hand, to have the former begin at
midnight. Just when astronomers are
often busiest, will be to them some*r***t

At the CoSminnib.a.
Eggs at $10,000. a Dozen,
| "T..at is a ridiculous price for such an
j egg as this," said a London auctioneer the
j other day, when a man bid 150 guineas for
.an egg. One of the company bid another
10 guineas, and as nobody could be per
suaded to go higher the egg was knocked
down for 160 guineas.
The egg which fetched such an extraor
dinary price was an egg of the Great Auk,
of which there are only seventy in exist
ence. The last Great Auk died half a cen
tury ago, and there are therefore no birds
left to lay any more of these precious
eggs. The one sold the' other day was
picked up ln Iceland sixty-seven years
mo, and was slightly, cracked, which de
plenty. Sometimes I just couldn't stand It
any longer; the tears would come. It was
so pitiful to see them lying there suffer
ing, and yet never forgetful of others
who might be forse.
"There were so many instances where
gritâ in every sense of the word
was shown. one fellow who had had a
hand to hand fight with two Filipinos'
came In terribly cut. Knives had been
used and a great gash was cut in his
cheek and the finger of each hand laid
open to the bone where the knife had
been jerked out of his hand. Do you
know that man stood there, puffed away
at a cigar, and never flinched once while
the doctors took seven stitches in his
cheek. He smoked continually, taking the
cigar out of his mouth with his drawn
up hand. It was only when they began
to work on his fingers, where the nerve
centers were, that he said anything, and
he jerked his hands away, saying, "Good
God, leave them alone!"
" 'But hadn't you better quit smoking?'
I asked him.
" 'No. lady; I couldn't stand the pain
if I did.'
"Another time a little Dutchman came
in holding up a bleeding, shattered hand.
" 'Hello, fellows: how you vas? Dey
got you, too?' he called out cheerily, and
he never moved nor murmured the whole
time the surgeon worked on his hand.
I gave him straight whisky. Malted milk
was too mild for such grit, and he de
clares to this day that I saved his life."
We chatted on different subjects for
a while and then gradually drifted down
to Manila again and to the soldier boys
who have found their resting places
there.
"The saddest sightâ the sight that
makes your heart ache and the hot tears
come to your eyesâ to see four or five,
sometimes six, hearses going to the cem
etery and not one mourner. I could not
bear to see those poor fellows taken out
there without, seemingly, one soul to
mourn them. Often would I follow the
hearses and think that some poor mother
at home might be grateful if she knew
a womanâ a woman who had a boy of
her ownâ nad followed hers to his grave.
Do you wonder I loved them all and
mothered and petted them? They were so
grateful, and often in their delirium would
call me 'Mother,' and want me to hold
their heads on my breast and smooth back
their hair."
Sobs were in Mrs. Boysen's voice as
she told me about them and about one
poor fellow over whom the surgeons were
working, and who caught sight of her
when one of the doctors stepped aside.
He pushed the others from him, saying:
" 'Get away; I want to see that wo
man.'
"1 went over to him and he threw his
arms around my neck, pulled my face
down to his and told me how much good
it did him to see me." ,
Guns, cartridges, bullets and Manila
souvenirs of all sorts and kinds Mrs. Boy
son showed me. "But this," handing me
a large buckle, shaped like a round sun
burst and beautifully enameled, "I prize
more than anything. Some of my boys
sent It to me before I left Manilaâ the
boys I had nursed."
"And would you really like to go back?"
I asked when leaving.
"Indeed, 1 should, and I just feel as
though 1 must."
Dear little woman, who mothered and
petted and cried over poor wounded sol
dier boys, God grant you all the happi
ness this world of ours is capable of giv
ing.

JOAQUIN MILLER'S
GREATEST POEM
OF THE DAY
copyrighted by Joaquin mrrrwr. â â  ..
The' Sword of Gideon, s word of God
Be with ye, Beers. Brave men of peace
Ye hewed the path, ye brake the sod,
Ye fed white flocks of at increase
Where Saxon foot had never trod;
Where Saxon foot unto this day
Mad measured not, had never known
id ye not bravely the way
And made such happy home your own.
I think God's house must be such home.
The priestess mother- choristers
Who spin and weave nor care to roam
Beyond this white God's house of hers,
But spinning sing and spin again.
3 think such silent shepherd men
Most like that few the prophet sings â
Host like that few stent Abram drew
Triumphant o'er the slaughtered Kings.
Defend God's use! Let fall the crook.
Draw forth the plowshare from the sod
And trust, as in the holy Book
The Sword of Gideon and of God : â
God and the right I enough to fight
A million ,regi ments of wrong.
Defend i nor count what comes of it.
God's battle bides not with the strong:
Her pride must fall. Lo, it is writ!
Her gold, her grace, how staunch she fares Iâ
Fame's wine cup pressing her proud lips â
Her checkerboard of battle squares
Rimmed round by steel built battle ships!
And vet rneanwhiles ten thousand miles
She seeks ye out. Well, welcome her !
Give her such welcome with such will
As Boston gave in battle's whir
That red, dread day at Bunker Hill.
The Heights, OcKJand, CaL. October, 1899
