was due to a cause of which no human
agency could possibly have had control.
Th> carriages that were to carry the

Ihe bead of the parade and thence to

t!*!?iPii.ious outpouring of the populace,

use the term when we met the admiral

formed in the streets adjacent to Riv
erside Park, and it came together like
j pieces of carefully adjusted mechan
ism. When it moved it passed actually
j between two solid walls of humanity.
Arrayed along the line of the parade
from One Hundred and Twenty-second
street to the arch the crowds of spec
tators on excursion boats and along the
| shores of the Hudson on Friday had as
' tonished all who saw them. The as
semblage of spectators to-day, massed
not by thousands but by hundreds of
thousands, was even more amazing.
! The beautiful weather made happy th>
speculators who had erected private
stands. The number of persons who
j saw Dewey certainly reached into the
I millions.
The admiral's progress from the
tomb of Grant to the reviewing stand '
was literally one of glorious triumph. I
He rode at the head of the procession,
with the Mayor, immediately following
Major General Roe and his staff. The
cheers with which he was greeted made
him ride bareheaded most of the way.
He was visibly affected, now and then
his lips twitched convulsively, and oc
casionally he wiped his eyes. Behind
Dewey in carriages came his fighting
captains and then his staff. After them
came Admircl Sampson and his staff,
captains of the North Atlantic squad
ron, then Rear Admiral Howison and
his staff, followed by Rear Admiral
Philip and his staff, and then a general
collection of guests, among whom were
Major General Miles and Rear Admiral
Schley.
To Admiral Sampson, who looked ill
and careworn, a warm reception was
given, but the ovation tendered to Rear
Admiral Schley was continuous, warm
and hearty. Schley, like all other
guests, was arrayed in full dress uni
form, and he presented a gallant and
dashing figure. It was evident that a
very large number of spectators re
garded Rear Admiral Schley as the real
victor of Santiago. A dash of South
ern gallantry marked Schley's progress.
At one point along the line a woman
threw toward him a silk flag- It fell
short. The admiral stopped the car
riage, sprang out, seized the flag, kissed
it, bowed to the lady, pinned it across
the breast of his uniform and was
away in the parade again, while the
spectators gave him a rousing cheer.
There were, however, other heroes in
line for whom there were evidences
that they occupy a warm place in the
hearts of the multitude. General Miles
was greeted with considerable enthusi
asm, but Governor Roosevelt, dressed
in frock coat and silk hat and mounted
on a spirited black horse, commanding
in person the 15.000 National Guardsmen
of the State, had a rousing reception.
The Governor's progress was suffi
ciently dramatic to satisfy his .most en
thusiastic admirers. He held the Na
tional Guard sufficiently in check, so
that there was always considerable
space between the regular army divi
sion that preceded him and himself.
Bowing to right and left and doffing
his hat every few feet, he presented a
very striking figure. Admiral Dewey's
recent tributes to Governor Roosevelt's
potent influence in preparing for the
victory at Manila had evidently been
taken to heart by the public. All per
sons agreed that Roosevelt's reception
was second to Dewey's, and that
Schley's was second only to that ac
corded Roosevelt.
Of the organizations in line the sail
ors from the Olympia received the most
applause. It should be borne in mind
that only about half of these men who
paraded to-day participated in the bat
tle of Manila, but the crowd didn't care
for that. It cheered them collectively,
and felt that each man was a hero. The
jackies and marines who did fight w r ore,
proudly pinned to their blue jackets, the
medal of honor voted to them by Con
gress.
But there was another organization
! that must not be forgotten. This was
I the Tenth Pennsylvania Volunteer Reg
j iment. It recently came back from
' Manila, where it had done splendid
J service. Colonel Hawkins, the regi
mental commander, died on his way
home, and Lieutenant Colonel Barnett
lis now in command. There was some
thing about this regiment that appealed
' to the multitude and reminded it of the
sad days in the fall of 1898 when the
volunteer regiments, with thinned ranks
and wasted forms, marched up Broad
way. At the front was a regimental
battle flag carried in the Philippines. It
was shot and tattered and a mute evi
dence of what the regiment had gone
through; and as the regiment went
along the flag was applauded with great
energy. There were still other organi
zations that must not be lost sight of.
In the position assigned to the Span
ish war veterans at the rear marched
the Astor Battery, which fought in the
Philippines, and there were two full
regiments of Spanish war veterans, one
raised in Brooklyn and the other in
Manhattan, that acted as rear guard.
It will give the general public a bet
ter idea of the spectacle if this sum
ming up now carries the admiral to
the reviewing stand and presents a
birdseye view of the organizations as
they passed. When the admiral rode
down Fifth avenue through the ap
proach to the arch he was overcome by
the splendor of the work of art that
spans the roadway. The sun shone
brilliantly upon the arch, and while he
continually doffed his hat to the plaud
its of the ten thousand people seated
in the amphitheater about the review
ing stand, his eyes were constantly
wandering up and down the massive
columns that bore the figures of Vic
tory and the statues of former naval
heroes. He mounted the reviewing

stand accompanied by the Mayor and
found it a flower garden. Wagon
loads of wreaths and floral horseshoes
and bouquets of flowers had been sent,
by his admirers. Quickly following
him came other naval officers, and in a
short time the reviewing stand and the
space behind it was filled with men in
all the glory of the army and navy full
J dress.
The reviewing party had scarcely got
settled in its seats when Sousa's band
came blaring down the avenue, playing
of course, "The Stars and Stripes For
ever," and leading the tars of the
Olympia. The tars went by in good or
der, every man, sailor and marine alike,
carrying a Lee rifle at present arms.
The sailors marched well, although
many of them had done no walking
ashore for months. The Olympia's bat
talion had been burned by the sun un
til they were almost the color of the
bronze medals of honor they wore so
proudly. Admiral Dewey, during the
passage of the naval division, stood
alone in the reviewing stand, erect, pre
i senting a striking and never to be for
[ gotten figure, his right hand raised in
j salute, so that the forefinger barely
! touched the peak of his chapeau.
When the division of the regular
army passed General Merritt took his
station beside the admiral and joined
him ir. review. A fine picture these
two veterans of the Manila campaign
presented, and the attention was about2

evenly divided between them anfi. the
Ewlftly moving military show.
Only one distressing incident oc
curred within his view. A wire had
been stretched across the space be
tween two of the stands In the park.
The awful press of people- broke it, and
they surged Into the avenue, those In
front powerless to resist the pressure
of the thousands In the rear. The po
lice officers on foot were helpless. Try
ey would they could not stem the
. which promised to Impede the en
parade. Suddenly a half hundred

shoved the people back. Many women
and children were caught In the crush.

a spirited air, and behind it was a bat

NIGHT OF JOY FOR THE
JACKIES OF THE OLYMPIA
NEW YORK, Sept. 30.-Flghting Jack
of the Olympia had a night of Joy to
night as a fitting end to his day of tri
umph. Its ohlef pleasures were a supper,
concert and smoker, served to him In that
order In the Waldorf-Astoria. He was
there, 250 strong, on shore leave and free
of all restraint With him were twenty
five men from each of the other ships at
anchor in the river, good fellows all, and
selected on that account. These figures
included about 10 per cent of marines,
permitted to be present on account of
past good fellowship and on Bolemn prom
lse to be good in the future.
The sailors and sea soldiers came to the
Waldorf singly and in twos, threes and
larger groups and were at once ushered to
the grand ballroom on the second floor,
which' had been carpsted for them and
set with tables and gilded chairs.
A uniform was ticket enough to secure
admission. As each man entered the ban
room ho was presented with a rubber
stemmed clay pipe bearing on Its head a
high relief of the great admiral's features,
and was also given two cigars, a two
package of plug tobacco, a book
of cigarette papers, a menu card and a
programme of the concert.
Oscar Hammers-tein was In charge of
the vaudeville programme, which con
sisted of sketches, songs, dances, etc.
Just before the curtain rose Randolph
Guggenheimer, president of the Munici
pal Council, read the following address:
"Men- of- the Olympia and American
navy: It gives me great pleasure to as
sure you that the city of New York,
which I have the honor to represent here
to-night, recognizes with pride the su
perb Bervlces rendered to the nation by
the man behind the guns. In the enthu
siastic reception we have Just given the
admiral who commanded the ships that
annihilated the Spanish fleet in Manila
Bay. we do not for one moment ignore
the fact that fearless and well disciplined
American sailors were the instruments of
Dewey'a genius. People of the United
â  are proud of the records of vic
tory, written in letters of flame and glory
on the pases of American history. We
â  detract from the fame of our great
admiral when we express our conviction
that the triumphs of the American navy

ssnesa and the American grit of
American sailors. In the name of the
viewing stand. Captain Coghlan and
Captain "Wildes joined him a moment
later, the crowd cheering like mad.
The first thing the admiral d;d was to
take off his hat in acknowledgment of
the crowd's greeting. Mayor Van
Wyck immediately took him in charge
and conducted him to a corner of the
inclosure where a chef was in waiting
with a hamper of sandwishc-s and some
bottles of wine. The admiral was great
ly pleased and said to the Mayor, "Ah,
that's good. It was a long pull, wasn't
It?" referring to the long ride. He
passed the sandwiches to his officers
and to Rear Admiral Sampson, much
as if he were out at a family picnic.
He drank one small glass of wine and
declined a second. He then walked
around, greeting his captains.
Art: ipson was cheered as he
alighted from his carriage. General
Miles was the next notable recognized.

to the crowd in acknowledgment.

MARCONI MAKING FINAL
PLANS FOR THE RACES
Further Experiments With the Wireless Telegraph
in Order That There May Be No Hitches in
Reporting the International Yacht Contests,
NEW YORK, Fept. 80.â Willie Signer Marconi Is thoroughly satisfied with the results of those tests made on
the Ponce on Friday during the naval parade, he will take the steamer down the bay for further experiments to-mor
row, in order that every posf-.ble guard may be made against accident. The station at Navesink Highlands will be
iii charge of one of Marconi's assistants, a.nd messages will be exchanged over a wireless circuit of from fifteen to
thirty miles. It is the intention of Marconi to take the Ponce to-morrow from Its station off East Twenty-seventh
street over the course tfi be sailed by the Columbia and Shamrock during the first race, which will, unless accident
prevents, be held on Tuesday next.
Marconi's object in making the trip to-morrow Is twofold: first, to accustom the operators to those atmospheric
conditions which exist in the vicinity of New Tork, and then to discover any possible defect which may exist in
the mechanism to be used in reporting the International yacht races for the Herald and The Call. Marconi busied
himself to-day In obtaining an insight into the intricacies of the American system of- custo.m3 inspection. Certain
portions of the apparatus to be used next week had, through no fault of Marconi, been delayed in reaching the Cus
tom-housa. It was absolutely necessary that a release be obtained.
What was at first considered impossible, however, was accomplished by the inventor's perseverance, and work
upon the equipment of the steamships Grand Duchesse and Mackay-Bennett were proceeded with as soon as the
officials were persuaded that they could release the apparatus.
The Grand Diichesse, Mackay-Bennett and Ponce will comprise the fleet which will be pressed Into service by
the Herald and Call in reporting the international yacht races, which will interest countless persons throughout the
world. The Mackay-Bennett will act as a receiving station, and in case anything should go radically wrong with the
n at Navesink Highlands operators who will be on the cable ship will take up the work of receiving reports of
the races sent from the Grand Duchesse and Ponce. The two ships last named will follow the two competing yachts as
closely as the regulations will allow. Messages from each will ba flashed ashore at intervals of not more than one
minute. . ' ,
Marconi to-morrow will devote himself to a series of practical tests merely for the sake of assuring himself that
everything aboard the Ponce and at the Navesink station is in the best possible order. Those who go down the bay
with the young inventor will have the advantage of being able to watch at close range the most careful series of ex
periments with wireless telegraphy ever conducted in this country.

[ who fought in their country's cause, I
! most heartily welcome you to this enter
i talnment."
The speech was frequently interrupted
| by cheers, and at the conclusion the jack
| ies gave three rousing cheers for Mr. Gug-
I genhelmer. They then gave three cheers
| for Admirals Dewey, Sampson and Howi
j son. During: tht speech Richard Croker
I entered. He received a rousing welcome.
The sailors and marines occupied nearly
: all the tables on the main floor, but in
1 the boxes were scenes of brilliant color.
] Pretty women and flashing Jewels side by
! side with officers in lace and gold formed
i a pretty picture. Among those in the
{ boxes were the Dewey family, excepting
the admiral himself, Governor Voor
bees of New JerEey, General Charles F.
Hoe. live captains of Dewey'a fleet and
Sir Thomas Lipton.
The jaokies enjoyed the programme Im
mensely. They applauded each act vig
orously. Their delight knew no bounds
when John W. Ransome appeared ia a
makeup of Admiral Dewey.
"You May Fire When You're Ready,
Griaiey," was the title of a song sung by
Mr. Ransome. In the course of his turn
Mr. Ransqxne wpoke of Admiral Schley.
Just as he did this the admiral entered
in evening dress. Every sailor and ma
rine present was on his feet in an in
stant, howling like mad, in compliment to
the hero of Santiago.
In response to the greeting Admiral
Schley arose and said:
"You may well cheer, my boys, for It
was you who did the trick. I'll give fair
warning to anybody who wants to try
conclusions with you that he wants to
know how to shoot pretty well. I am
more than nappy to participate in your
smoker, and nothing touches me so much
as the affection of those splendid men
who were my companions In the navy."
There was more cheering when the
singer mentioned the name of Admiral
Sampson.
Some one called for three cheers for the
Shamrock, and when they had been given
Sir Thomas Lipton rose in a box and said:
"1 am -glad to be herÂ© to-night with
Dewey's men, and I have some boys of
my own. that I am proud of, too. I have
come over here to get a certain American
property and I'll get it if you Americans
I won't squash me in my little naval en-
I gagement as you squashed those fellows
I in the Philippines."
â  Sir Thomas was loudly applauded. Cap

by the squadron's band, mounted. Then
came the Twenty-third Regiment of
Brooklyn and the Fourteenth Regi
ment.
While the Second Regiment was
passing Admiral Schley, accompanied
by Captain Coghlan, Levl P. Morton
and Dr. Depew, left the reviewing
stand and proceeded along the line to
j the Fifth Avenue Hotel. Admiral
Schley was watched with eager interest
by the crowd, and until he passed out
of sight he was loudly cheered. He
seemed a great favorite.
There was an elaborate display of
I kite-flying during the review. Suspend
ied immediately over the reviewing
stand and at a great height was an
immense American flag held by five
kites. Another line of kites held a
series of pennants in the national
t colors, while other lines held flags and
streamers of various sorts. The wind
was just strong enough and the sun
light sufficient to bring out a most
beautiful effect. Admiral Dewey no
ticed the flags and expressed himself as
well pleased with the display. Wrdl â¢â¢
the Sixty-fifth Regiment of Buffalo was
; passing Admiral Dewey complained of
; being chilled, and his overcoat was
j handed to him. - The Twenty-second
Regiment made a fine appearance, and
BeveraJ times the admiral removed his
: chapeau as they passed.
Everybody was speculating as to the
I reception of the Seventh Regiment at
j the reviewing stand. It was more cor
dial than was expected. There was some
ng as the regiment passed the
I stand and some derisive calls, but the
i cheering at this point was easily the
j loudest.
At Fifty-ninth street and Fifth aye
! nue the Seventh was hissed. People
: in the Netherland, Savoy and Plaza ho
i heered, but the hisses rose above
the cheering. The members of the reg
i iment looked neither to the right nor to
the left, but marched stolidly on. The
Seventy-first Regiment was cordially
welcomed. The admiral took off his hat
* to the command as it passed.
The Naval Militia of the State troops
made a magnificent display. The o'.d
guard, resplendent in white coat, blue
\ trousers and bearskin shakos closed thÂ«
Xiv: York Slate display.
The Pennsylvania troops received a
royal welcome when they reached the
and reviewing stands. Somebody
in th* 1 State stand proposed three cheers
. for Pennsylvania just after the Gov
ernor had passed. They were given
with a will. The Pennsylvantans lived
I up to their national reputation as sol
diers, so Car as tlvir appearance was
< oncerned. Two companies of colored
troops among the Quaker soldiers re
i . Ived much applause as they passed.
The .greatest applause given to any of
th" military organizations was accorded
; to the crack 'ivnth Pennsylvania Regi
i ment, which got back from the Philip
j pines a short time ago. This regiment
! marched in the regulation khaki uni-
I form which they wore during their
I service before Manila. The colors, torn

commander of the Olympla, was recog
nized, cheered and made a speech. General
Miles was next recognized, and he said to
the sailors that they had put the Ameri
can flag on a higher eminence than it had
ever attained before. Captain Jewell of
the Brooklyn was cheered, and there were
calls for Captain Coghlan to recite "Hoch
der Kaiser," but he would not do it.
Colonel Stewart then recited Joe Kerr'3
poem, "Hello, Dewey."
Hel'.o, Dewey'. Have a seat!
How" re th" boys? An' how's th' fleet?
Little weary? Never mind!
You can rest when you're Inclined â
Rest on laurels, It you please,
On a hero's couch of ease.
Not, however, tlil we've had
chance to Bhow you that we're gladâ
Glad you're not now with the dead;
Glad you had a level head;
you laid the Spaniard low;
Glad you proved a noble foe;
Glad you kept your record clean;
Glad we made you a marine;
Glad you bravely fought and won;
Glad for everything you've done!
Glad? By gad, we're glad, my lad,
That George Dewey had a dad.
Glad ha had a mother, who,
Loyal to Red. White and Blue-
Years bo. when he was young-
Taught him how toâ rung by rung-
Mount Fame's ladder â never Etop
Till, by grit, he gained the top;
Taught him, when he'd won the fight.
How to stay there, on the height.
Glad to ccc you. George; butâ say!
Dont get spoiled on Dewey day!
Don't get "rattled" at the noise
Made by millions of my boys
Most of whom would "lead the .dance"
If, like you, they had the chaace.
Words like these all men admire: â
"Grldley, when you're ready, flre!"
Keep that up! â Keep cool, my lad!
"vVe'll raise Cain because we're glad;
You just "watch our smoke," my boy.
Note our overwhelming joy;
Don't get dizzy! â Calm content â 
Sometimes makes a President. â â 
Hear that shouting, prolonged â loud I
Georgre, th' whole darned Nation's proud;
Proud of what you did that day
In Manila's beastly bay.
Pror.d of youâ proud of a fleet
That knows no fear â knows no defeat;
Of whom the wide world stands In awe.
God bless you, George! Hip, hip. hurrah!
It wa3 received with unbounded ap
plaupo and laughter. The whole audience,
standlr.tr, then joined in singing "The
Star-spangled Banner."
Admiral Dewey uncovered to the col
ors am! nodded his head sympathetic
ally. The men marched as veterans
should, and while every man In the reg
iment wanted to see Dewey, it was not
discipline, and the regiment marched
as on>? man, straight ahead, "eyes
front."
. The New Jersey troops followed those
from Pennsylvania, and were a mag
nificent body of men â as fine as any In
the column. Governor Voorhees did not
march at the head of the New Jersey
troops. With his staff he stood In front
of the State stand, opposite Admiral
Dewey, while his troops went by. New
Jersey had two Naval Reserve battal
ions ami one troop of cavalry in line.
Next to the reception to the Tenth
Pennsylvania was that to the Georgia
troops, v. ho marched by with State and
national colors flying, to the tune of
"Dixie." They were loudly cheered.
The Connecticut troops Â«were a pic
turesque lot. Several companies wore
the brilliant uniforms of colonial days.
There were also two companies
awheel.
Just after the Georgia troops began
passing the reviewing stand Admiral
Dewey Fat down for the first time and
remained seated a moment or two.
Connecticut had one of the largest
bodies of troops in line. Maryland was
well represented with Its "Dandy
Fifth," commanded by Colonel Frank
Marcoe. A splendid band at the head
awakened loud applause with "Mary
land, My Maryland," and "Dixie." This
State had also the Fourth Regiment,
Colonel Willard Howard commanding.
It was a close rival to the Fifth.
South Carolina had a large and va
ried representation. Ohio followed with
Governor Bushnell at the head. This
State had the Fourth and Fifth regi
ments and some unattached troops and
a Gatling pun battery. These troops
served in the Spanish-American war
and recently did riot work at Cleve
land.
On account of the controversy be
tween the members of the committee
and the head of the G. A. R. over the
place to be given that organization in
the column and Commander Kay's
final order to his men not to march.'
there was much speculation as to what
the unarmed section of the guard would
be like and how many would defy Kay's
mandate. Thousands who were other
wise weary and would have left the
reviewing stand and other places wait
ed to see. General O. O. Howard, griz
sled old veteran that he is, was given
n mighty cheer when he rode past the
admiral at the head of the column. He
had all told about 600 veterans of the
Civil War, and about 200 of these were
Grand Army men. Rome wore the
Grand Army uniform and caps, but the
majority were 'in plain civilian clothes.
The rest of the veterans were Loyal
Legion men, with a sprinkling of men
who. fought In the Civil War, but they
do not now belong to any organization.
The veterans went wild- when they saw
Admiral Dewey. Instead of the stiff
salute given by every other command
the. old fellow's called for three cheers
for the admiral and in other ways man
ifested their delight.
Admiral Dewey was almost as cor
dial, and his hat was off his head all
the time his old comrades in arms were
passing by. One soldier, too much used
up by disease to walk, was carried by
his comrades on a little wagon. He
was lying at full length as he passed
the reviewing stand, but he raised him
self feebly on one arm and nodded to
the admiral. It was pathetic.
There were several thousand veterans
of the Spanish war. Most of them wore
their service clothes, and although
without arms they presented a decid
edly businesslike appearance. The un
armed section passed quickly in re
view, and the parade was over. It had
taken just three hours and twenty min
utes to pass. The first body of the ad
miral's sailors passed him at 2:12 p. m.
and the last man in line went by at 5:40
p. m.
Hardly had the ambulances which
brought up the rear pulled under the
arch when Squadron A galloped into ,
place for the admiral, ready to escort
him to his hotel.
The admiral and Mayor Van Wyck
wore completely tired out after the re
view. The admiral's arm was so weary
from the almost constant salute that
in bidding good-by to his friends he
sometimes begged leave to shake hands
with his left hand. His carriage was
quickly brought, and, entering it in a
perfect hurricane of cheers, he was
driven away. A gigantic sailor who sat
on the box with the cockswain carried
the bouquet of orchids which had been
presented to the admiral during the
afternoon.
The police arrangements during the
day were almost perfect, and at no time
did the police do better work than in
getting the crowds off the reviewing
stands. The crowds overran Madison
square Park, jammed the streets all
around and made frantic efforts to get
away. Through the crosstown streets
there hurried a surging, jostling, hun
gry crowd, fighting its way for any kind
of conveyance that would take it home.
Yet the crowds did not seem to dimin
ish. Thousands came to take the places
vacated around the arch, and the work
of the police only made it possible for
one crowd to get out and another to get
in. Of course the newcomers were not
allowed In the stands, but they got just
as close to them as the police would
permit.
NEW YORK'S LOVING
CUP DULY PRESENTED
NEW YORK, Sept. 80.â The first cere
mony to-day was the presentation at the
City Hall of a gold loving cup to the
admiral by Mayor Van Wyck on behalf
of the city of New York. At 7 o'clock the
police boat Patrol, with a special recep
tion committee on board made up of St.
Clair, McKelway, William McAdoo, Levi
P. Morton, Chauncey M. Depew, Richard
Croker and Warren M. Foster, started for
the Olympia. The admiral boarded the
Patrol, which steamed to the Battery,
where the city's guest was met by the
following committee: William Berri, Gen
oral Francis V. Greene, James Stillman,
John C. Calhoun, Edward Lauterbach, J.
Q. A. Edwards, Charles Knox, John 11.
Starln, Warner Van Norden, Justice W.
W. Goodrich, Justice Charles M. Van
Brunt and O. S. Cookney.
The admiral, accompanied by the re
ception committee and escorted by Squad
ron A and a detail of mounted police, pro
ceeded up Broadway to the City Hull. All
along the street were cheering crowds,
and the City Hall Park was lilled to the
limit with people who shouted a noisy,
enthusiastic welcome as Dewey came in
sight. As Admiral Dewey sat in his car
riage at the Battery, waiting for the line
to arrive, he was asked if he had any
expressions to make concerning the cele
brations. He replied:
"No: I have nothing to say this morn
ing. I have not yet got my eyes open."
In referring to the demonstrations of yes
terday and last night he said, "It was
magnificent."
â  i rnor Rooeeve't, accompanied by his
aajutant, Avery D. Andrews, his orderly
and Seth Low, were among the first to
arrive at the City Hall for the presenta
tion ceremony. They got there a lew min
utes after 8 o'clock, and were ushered into
tin' Mayor's office. The Mayor had not
yet arrived, but he put in an appearance
a few minutes later. Then came Admiral
Philip, Colonel Treadwell, Captain Asa
Walker and Charles H. Knox. A few
minutes later Rear Admiral Schley came
in full dress, and was received by Gen
eral Howard Carroll. In a short time the
Mayor's office tilled up with military and
naval officers in full dress uniform. Ad
miral Schley was the center of attraction,
and he was kept busy shaking hands with
those who were introduced to him. Cap
tain Coghlan, formerly of the Kaleigh,
came in and was greeted with "Hoch der
Kaiser." He smilingly responded and
shook hands with all around.
It was 8:40 o'clock when the tread of
the cavalry was heard and the people in
the Mayor's office looked out to see Troop
A, followed by the carriages with the ad
miral and the committees.
"Fall in after the Mayor," shouted Sec
retary Downes, and Mayor Van Wyck and
his secretary hastened to the platform in
front of the building, where the presenta
tion was to take place. The Mayor had
just reached the platform when Admiral
I >ewey came up the staira. The admiral
walked over to the Mayor and with a
hearty good-morning shook him warmly
by the hand.
Captain Lamberton, Lieutenant Brum
by, Chauncey M. Depew, Levl P. Morton
and Richard Croker followed, and then
cume the other officers of the Olympia
and the remaining members of the com
mittee.
By this time the military and naval of
ficers in the Mayor's office and the prom
inent citizens realized that Dewey had
come, and they made a rush for the plat
form. There was danger of it being over
crowded, and Captain Copeland of the
City Hall bejuad closed the gates, shutting
out Admiral Schley, Captain Coghlan,
Captain Walker, Captain Dyer, Governor
Roosevelt and other prominent persons,
who arrived a minute late.
Rear Admiral Schley climbed over the
gate, and he was followed by the other
naval officers, but Governor Roosevelt re
mained behind. One of his staff rushed
up to Captain Copeland of the police
squad and whispered: "The Governor
feels slighted."
The gate was opened again and Coloiel
Roosevelt took' his place within, the in
closure. Admiral Dewey evinced a desire
to shake hands with' all the naval officers
and introduce them to the Mayor. He al
most hugged Admiral Schley, and he pat
ted Captain Coghlan on the back.
As Dewey greeted Schley the crowd sent
up cheer after cheer for Dewey and
Schley.
As anon as the greetings were over the
Mayor began his speech presenting the
city"a loving cup.
When the Mayor had concluded Admiral
Dewey began to reply by saying:
"It would be quite impossible for me,
Mr. Mayor, to express in words "
At this point he was interrupted with
cheers, and he began again:
"It would be quite impossible to express

After the formal ceremonies Admiral
Dewey went about shaking hands with
his friends.
"Come here, all you captains," he said,
addressing the naval captains presei.t.
Then he introduced each to the audieme.
"Captain Lamberton of the Olympic."
hf cried. "Captain Wilder of the Bostcn,
Captain Coghlan of the Raleigh, Captain.

When the captains had all assembled he
waved his hands toward them and said: ,
"These are the men who did it. Th' se
are- the rr.on who should be thank'd.
Without them I could do nothing."
The loving cup presented to the admiral
is Roman in form and is made of 18-karat
gold. The handles are formed of three
dolphins, -wrought in green and geld.
Around the nock are forty-five stars, em
blematic of the Union. The body of :he
cup Is divided by the handles into th-ee
panels, which are employed for the prir.ci
pal decorations. On 'the front panel is a
portrait in relief of Admiral Dewey, sur
rounded with a wreath of oak leaves, the
whole resting en an eagle with rut
-1 stretched wings. Underneath this panel,
upon the band arcur.d the foot, are the
letters "G. D., U. S. N." The second
panel has chased in half relief a picture
of the Olympla and beneath is a sh eld
with four stars, betokening the recipient's
grade. On the third pan^l is an escutch
eon upon which is engraved the in
scription, with the names of the mayor
and members of the municipal assembly
and of the committee of plan and scipe.
The coat of arms of the city of Xew 1 ork
appears below the inscription. About the
feet are a series of anchors,' a rope tie! in
three knots, dolphins, seaweed and c;her
nautical devices. The cup stands -hir
teen inches high, has a capacity of four
and a half quarts and cost $5000.

SMALL SICKNESSES.
Do Not Neglect Them; They Often Grow
Into Larger Ones.
Piles are painful, persistent, hard to
cure, but they can be cured. There is just
one remedy that will do it. It is a recent
discovery, but it has been on the market
long enough to have the indorsement of
leading physicians and the recommenda-
tion of thousands of cured patients.
Pyramid Pile Cure acts quickly and di-
rectly, it cures the cause of the trouble.
Cures it so that the effect is permanent.
A great many salves and ointments will
give relief for a few minutes. That is not
what is wanted. Pyramid Pile Cure will
cure any sort of pilesâ Itching or
bleeding. It will cure the lightest or the
most aggravated case. The first applica-
tion will do more good than a dozen, boxes
of any of the many so called cures
now sold. Read these letters. The/ are
from people who have tried it:
Mr. J. W. Rollins, a gentleman living at
Sweet Springs, Mo., writes briefly and to
the pent regarding his experience with
piles. He says: I consider the Pyramid
Pile Cure without an equal. It cured mo
in less than thirty days. I waited fifteen
days or more to be sure the remedy had
fully cured me before writing you. I can
now say I am cured, and I shall recom-
mend the Pyramid Pile Cure at every pos-
sible opportunity, because it deserves it.
Miss Easter Xunley , of . Tracy . City,
Term., writes: The Pyramid Pile Cure has
done my sister more good than anything
she has ever taken. I have nothing but
words" of warm commendation for it.
From J. D. Roberts, Mt. Moriah, Mo.: I
have used the Pyramid Pile Cure and re-
sults have been entirely satisfactory.
There can be no question but that it is
j certain and lasting cure for piles; at least
I it has so provei. in my case. â

Bereft Â«.-f the countless, confusing
phases, due to secrecy regarding the
Intentions of the Government involved
and the contradictory reports from the
troubled territory, the most probable
solution of the situation seems this:
The Boers, who evidently must s<=>e the
efforts of the British Government to
avert hostilities until the arrival of re
enforcements, having, weeks ago,
planned a campaign, will put it Into
operation perhaps as early as this
week. They will probably avoid en
f.:^"inents and devote their energies to
the destruction of property and the cap
ture of pris 'ners. and perhaps raid on
Delagoa Bay. It seems unlikely that
they, will attack via Laings Neck and
other passes of that country, for the
simple reason that these points are so
openly talked about as their probable
points of aggression, keenest observers
believe it to be more likely that the
Boers will pperate through Zululand,
thus Treating a diversion of the 15,000
British troop? now chiefly massed at
Lady Smith or in its neighborhood.
In the meanwhile, or perhaps pre
vious to this, a British army corps con
sisting of 20,000 men or more, will be
sent out. Parliament will be sum
moned, anil no doubt the necessary sup
plies will be-granted, though there will
be some hut debating.
Regarding the plans of campaign of
the respective armies there is no reli
able information, though it is the gen
eral assumption that the main object
of the British will be the capture of
Pretoria. The duration of the conflict
Is a matter of widest surmise, though
Continental and British papers do not
express the faintest doubt that It will
resUlt in the defeat of the Boers and
the addition of their country to Great
Britain's colonies.
"Were peace or war dependent merely
upon matters of suzerainty or the fran
rhise there might be some hope that
hostilities may be averted at the last
moment. But the Associated Press
learns that apparently there is truth In
what the peace-party papers have often
hinted at; that is to say. that the un
derlying motive actuating the British
Government throughout the negotia
tions has been the suppression of what
it has reason to believe was a fÃi
reaehing conspiracy for the establish
ment of a Dutch faction from Zambesi
Ito the Cape. The authority for this
statement Is Mr. Chamberlain himself.
In conversation, so a representative
of the Associated Press was reliably in
formed, the Secretary of State for the
Colonies said that one great feature of
the situation, which could not be
brought before the public for fear that
i the Government's object might be mis
' interpreted, was the Cabinet's well
defined understanding that for months
a carefully fostered plot had been- in
pro ress to form a Dutch federation.
l!e also referred to the action of the
Orange Free State and to that of the
Afrikander members of the Cape Legis
; lature. which Bomewhat confirm Mr.
Chamberlain's view;, for it if! impossible
to believe that such important steps
would result from mere spontaneity of
, sentiment "ri a current dispute.
It has long been suspected that the
â¢ Cabin-: wai prompted by more vital
questions than the Outlander rights,
and, if Mr. Chamberlain is quoted cor
rectly, it would appear that Great Brit
ain will not stop until reassured of the
absolute safety of her supremacy in
Smith Africa.
The Speaker, a peace advocate, ad
mits regretfully that the war party is
1 in the ascendant in Great Britain, and
evejry London daily except the Chron
icle supports Mr. Chamberlain* with
every afternoon paper, except -the
Westminster Gazette, the Star and
Echo. Among the country paper's,
i however, some of the most influential
papers oppose the war. Their feelings
are voiced by the Speaker, saying:
"We feel fated to be plunged into a
! war for which the historian will be
| unabio to find adequate justification, or
; even a plausible excuse."
The session of the British Parlia
ment is not expected to be either long
I or exciting and to be mainly, devoted to
| voting the necessary money and sup

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. OCTOBER 1. 1599.

Opinions appeared to favor the belief

The prospect of stringency in the

London and Australia. Â£3.000,000 has
been drawn, while it is impossible to

gold and the need of gold to move the
crops In Egypt and South America,
makes promise of a greater stringency
than has been expertfAced for years
' past.
DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE
STILL HOPES FOR PEACE
LONDON, Sept. 30.â The Duke of Dev
onshire, I^ord President of the Council, at
a public; luncheon at the Technical Schools
at New Milli-. Derbyshire, near Man
chester, this afternoon, replying to a toaÂ«t
to his health, referred to the Transvaal
I situation, saying:
"1 wish 1 could say anything to relieve
i the anxiety that you, 1 and the whole
country feel u_s to the prospects in South
Africa. AVhen the Cabinet separated yes
! terday it had not received an answer to
! the dispatch sent last week. If we can
give any credit to unofficial sources of ln
-1 formation, it is not likely that the tenor
j of the reply will put an end to the exist-
Ing painful tension.
"The obstacle which seems to stand in
the way ol a peaceful settlement appears
tv be the rooted conviction of the Boers
; that we cherish designs hostile to their
' independence. That such apprehensions
i are unfounded has been asserted as
strongly as possibleâ officially in our dis
patches and unofficially by members uf
I the Government.
"The unfounded suspicions of President
Kruger and hi 3 Government cannot re
! lieve us of the duty of taking measures
! for the protection of our fellow subjects
I and the interests of peace and good gov
j eminent. The stage of negotiations
reached is that we do not see any ad
-1 vantage in pressing the proposals we have
; made In regard to the iranchlse and the
! admission of the uitlanders to a voice in
â  the assembly which governs the affairs of
i the South African republic. These pro
i posals have never been an essential point
I of difference. They were made on the sug-
I gestlon of Sir Alfred Milner, British High
[ Commissioner in South Africa and Gov
ernor of Cape Colony, as a means where
iby undoubted grievances of our fellow-
I subjects might be redressed without the
necessity Of interference by the British
Government.
â¢â¢These proposals have not been received
I in a spirit which leads us to hope that
! they will lead to a solution of the ques
tion We have been driven (o the neces
! slty of formulating requirement* which
i we consider ourselves entitled to make
! not only under the conventions but by
virtue of our interest and the duty of
I every State to protect its own citizens
; and for the maintenance of peace and
i order in South Africa.
"The military preparations made by the
i Transvaal have compelled us to make
similar preparations, and as these will en
; tail considerable expenditure the Govern
ment considers that this matter ought to
receive the sanction of Parliament . hence
. Parliament will soon be summoned.
â¢â The Government will' gladly welcome
; that opportunity for Inviting judgment of
its conduct throughoul the negotiations.
"1 can only hope thai more moderate
counsels may prevail in the Transvaal
and that some means will be found to
disabuse the people there of the Ideaâab
solutely unfoundedâ that we cherish any
designs of interfering with their inde
pendence or require anything for our peo
ple but the barest fights and the barest
measure of justice. If they should so
frame their policy there Is no need that
the existence of their state shall be a
continual source of anxiety and trouble iti
that portion of Africa."
THOUGHTS OF WAR
UPPERMOST IN ENGLAND
I/DNDON, Sept. 30.- Forebodings of war
to come have almost banished from the
people's minds all thought of the murh
coveted America's cup and the fortunes
of the Shnmroek. >*
For a timf yesterday th* city was sim
ply in a state of fever heat, for it waa
tne day of the Cabinet meeting, at which,
though nothing was expected to be known
of the deliberations of the Ministers, it
w;ih thought they would push the
into a corner where they must either fight
or give in.
Jt was said recently that the Govern
ment's opinion was that if it came to war
with the Transvaal it would cost Great
Britain Â£5,000,000. The Government has
KmiH a good way toward expending that
amount already, for the transportation of
troops with accessories from England and
India to positions in Natal, according to
inf->rmation derived from an official
source, has cost so far nearly Â£1,000,000.
TRIUMPH OF GREAT
BRITAIN IS PREDICTED
ROME, Sept. 30.â The Osservatore Rn
mano, organ of the Vatican, printed an
editorial to-day vindicating the British
demands In the Transvaal and predicting
the triumph of Great Britain. This edi

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad. Sept. 30.
â It is the generally accepted belief here
that the revolution in Venezuela is
ended. General Castro, leader of the
revolution, is expected daily to an
nounce his Cabinet. As El Mocho Her
nandez, at the timo of his incarceration
by President Andrade, ordered his offi
cers to join General Castro's forces,
which they did, there is now no division
in the revolutionary party. The best
feeling exists between Hernandez and
the Castro factions. The troops of the
Venezuelan Government under General
Luciano Mendoi.a are now intrenched
at Los Colorados. with a view of mak
ing a final stand there against General
Castro.
The final battles in former revolutions
have been fought at Los Colorados. As
it is a railroad town it is easy to get
heavy ordnance forward to the
trenches. General Castro has been suc
cessful In outwitting the Government.
The advance guard of revolutionists
proceeded to Los Colorados, while the
main army under General Castro made
a circuitous route In the mountains
around Piedra Azul into El Valle, three
miles from Caracas, without any oppo
sition, leaving the Government troops
under General Mendoza in the rear.
General Castro's advance guard is now
at the gates of Caracas.

requisitioned in the street and stables and
the town was depleted.
The West Hand command of 600 men
started for the front this morning and the
Johannesburg corps of 750 men is follow

In the meantime business is stagnant
and the exodus of Outlanders continues,
200 leaving Johannesburg on one train to
day.

WILL JOIN THE ARMY
BRUSSELS. Sept. 30.â The Messager de

Other vessels are required for the service.

SACRIFICED HIMSELF
TO SAVE OTHERS
SPOKAXE. Sept. 30.â A Cascade, B. C,
siif-fial to the Spokesman-Review says:
Cascade received a terrible baptism of
fire last night. Alex Arvell was killed
while heroically trying to save others.
The property loss is about $33,000; the In

The burned district covers a solid block
in the heart of the town. Six hotels and
one cigar Btore were burned in an hour.
All the burned buildings hjd sleeping oc

night. Carriages took the party to the
famous old Empire mine, where the
beauty of Grass Valley served a royal
luncheon amid the park-line beauty that
tops the veins from which $5,000,000 have
come. At the mines and in the town the
hospitality was hearty and free, and even
the Californians v,ere surprised and de

A party of correspondents and pho

the wrecked bridge " across the river
separating the two armies, and at '.<
o'clock a group came down the track
waving handkerchiefs, on bamboo and
halted before the bridge. A bugle then
sounded the "Attention," and Major
Shields of General Wheaion's staff and
five j soldiers with raised handkerchiefs
picked their way across the bridge. The
Filipinos introduced themselves â Gen

rebellion against .Spain; Lieutenant

were carrying monkeys andotherthings
from their Filipino friends. General
[Wheeler, being anxious to see the Fili
pinos, forded the river with a corporal
mounted behind, and the staff horses
carrying double.
General Wheeler shook hands with
the Filipinos, and there was a general
exchange of greetings while the pho
tographers plied their vocation across
the track. The file of barefooted Fili
pino soldiers curiously surveyed the
line of stalwart American sentinels,
whose physique contrasted strongly
with the little brown men, who looked
too little lor. their guns. General
[Wheeler", who had no official connection
with the incident, returned to General
Arthur, and General Wheaton ap
peared at the other end of the bridge.
The Commissioners' and prisoners ford

lln M. Carter, Corps of Engineers, Unite!
States Army, and a formal order was to
day issued from the War Department
directing the execution of the sentence.

Kinerrs, T"nlted States Army, to be dismissed

Secretary of War.
Executive Mansion. Washington, D. C, Sept.
29, 1839.â Approved and confirmed.
WILLIAM McKIN'LEY.
Appended to the orders above Is the
following:
By direction of the Secretary of War, Captain
Oberlin M. Carter. Corps of Engineers, United
States Army, ceases to be an officer of the
army from this date, and the United States
penitentiary, Fort Leavenworth, Kans-., .Is
designated as the place of his confinement,
where he will be sent by the commanding gen
eral. Department- of the East, under proper
guard.
By command of Major General Miles.
H. C. CORBIN, Adjutant General.
Charges were preferred against Captain I
Carter by General John M. Wilson, chief I
of engineers, December 13, 1897. These }
charges were made after the Investigation i
by a board of engineers of the river and
harbor works at Savannah, Ga., and other
points in that district which had been
under th.> supervision of Captain Carter.
The charges mainly consisted of a decla
ration that Carter had entered into a con
spiracy with other persons to defraud the
United States. It was alleged in the I
| charges that Carter and certain parties I
had defrauded the United States out of!
from $l,6'Â»),000 to $2,000,000. The trial of
the charges by a court-martial, over i
which General Otis, now commanding in '
| the Philippines, presided, lasted several
months. The Judge advocate of the court
was Colonel Thomas F. Barr and the court
itself consisted of officers in nearly every
branch of the service and of high rank.
The trial resulted in the verdict and
sentence which were approved to-day.
The case has attained widespread noto
riety on account of the financial and
social connections of Captain Carter. No
such consideration and no such amount of
time has ever been given previously in a
court-martial.
The reference to the Attorney General
is also something unusual, but this ac
tion was taken, it is said, to give the of
ficer every opportunity to prove
his innocence. The charges which are
disproved are of minor importance, and
relate to smaller Items of river and har
bor works, in which it was alleged Cap
tain Carter had defrauded the Govern
ment. The main contentions of the pros
ecution are sustained.
The only matter pending in the War
Department in the Carter case is the

NEW YORK, Sept. 30.â Captain Oberlin
M. Carter, who has been convicted by
court-martial of defrauding the Govern
ment was arrested In the New York Ath
letic Club this morning by Assistant Ad
â  ; General Simpson, U. S. A., who
â¢ fr"Mi Washington for the purpose
under instructions of the Secretary of
War. Captain Carter is now a prisoner
in Castle William, Governor's Island.
General Merritt, commander of the Dp
partment of the Bast, received a telegram
this morning informing him that an oillcer
was in New York for the purpose of ar
resting Captain Carter. The telegram
stated that the officer had been instructed
i,. report to him. At 10 o'clock Major
Simpson reached Governor's Island with
his prisoner. General Merritt had then
left for the purpose of participating in the
military parade. Colonel Barbour, as
sistant adjutant general, received the
prisoner in behalf of General Merritt and
then turned him over to Captain B, K.
Roberts, commander of the post. Captain
Roberts said to-night:
"Captain Carter is securely locked up In
a cell alone, under guard. Every precaution
will be taken that he does not escape, but
he will be treated with all respect as a
prisoner. He was nervous and very much
affected when he arrived here and said
that his arrest had been a great surprise
to him. He will remain in Castle William
until further orders from Washington are
received and will then be taken to Fort
Leavenworth. Kas., where he will serve
his sentence."
Captain Roberts believes that Carter
will be taken West about next Wednes
day. In the meantime the only visitors
that will be permitted to see him will be
members of his family and counsel and
then only in the presence of the com
mandant of the post or his lieutenant,
who is officer of the prison.

CENTENARIAN DIES
IN MARYSVILLE
MARYSVILLE, Sept. 30.â Mrs. Percilla Nelson, a colored woman, who
claimed to be 130 years of agre, died at the home of her son, Nathaniel Nel
son, this afternoon. According to the family records. Mrs. Nelson was born
in Cocke County, Tennessee, in 1769.
She crossed the plains in 1549 and settled In San Joaquin County, where she
resiiiid twenty years before coming to Marysville. Mrs. Churchill of this
city is a daughter of the deceased and there are numerous grandchildren.
Mrs. Nelson used tobacco all her life, and up to a few years ago could
thread a needle without the aid of spectacles. "While many say that she
did not reach the ripe age she claimed, there Is every reason to believe that
she had passed the century mark by ten or a dozen years.
GEOGRAPHERS
WELL RECEIVED
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Sept. 30.â The opening of
the International Geographical Con
gress Wednesday was a brilliant affair.
: The sessions hall of the Prussian House
iof Delegates was suitably decorated
and thronged with distinguished cos
mopolitans numbering 1300, including
the Prince Regent of Brunswick, Prince
Herman of Saxe-Weimar and Princess
Therese of Bavaria, who conversed with
| Count yon Goetzen. well known in
i America, about his paper on the latest
1 discoveries regarding the headwaters of
the Nile. The representatives of the
'â  German Government included the aged
< hancellor, Prince Hohenlohe. The
United States Embassador, Andrew D.
White; Professor Davis of Harvard,
Professor Boise of New York, Professor
Brynat of Philadelphia, Mrs. Watson
of Boston and Arthur C. Jackson of
' Seattle were among the Americans
present.
Next week's papers include Poultney
Bigelow on "Colonial Administration
in Various Parts of the World"; Pro
fessor Boas on "The Jesup North Pa
cific Expedition"; Miss Luella Agnes
Owen of St. Joseph, Mo., on "Blul'fs of
I the Missouri River," and Professor Da
vis on "Land Forms Due to Glacial
Erosion." Of especial Interest will be
Professor Ratzelo's paper on "The Ori
gin and Spread of Indo and German,"
on Tuesday.
The press has cordially welcomed the
congress' members, and much social at
tention has been shown them. Besides
j Prince Hohenlohe's dinner of Thursday
j there was a special performance in
I honor of the Congress at Urania yester
' day, and the city gave a big fete at the
Zoological Garden this evening, which
place was brilliantly illuminated with
SSOO electric lights. About 1500 persons
sat down to the banquet, which was
served at sixty-four tables, each pre
sided over by a member of the Munici
pal Council. The big orchestras and ;t
military band furnished the music. To
morrow there will be two excui
and Monday and Tuesday there will be
special performances, a concert and a
ball at the Kaiserhof and a gala per
formance of "The Meisterpinger" at the
opera. Wednesday the president of the
congress, Baron yon Richthofen. wiil
give a big entertainment, and Mr.
White will give. a luncheon to a number
of the delegates. The Emperor, if he is
back p.t Potdda'm in time, intends t > re
ceive the more distinguished delegates,
but this is uncertain.
The em-respondent here of the Associ
ated Press has had an interview with
Dr. Xansen regarding the probable out
come of the present polar expedition
and those planned. He said they would
doubtless increase the sum of human
knowledge, but he did not believe the
poles would be reached in the present
state of human capacity, eauipment and
technical means, all of which are wholly
imperfect. Dr. Nansen added that the
poles 'will probably not be reached even
if international co-ope.ra.tion is practi
cally and systematic? lly carried out,
as may be one of the results of the
present congress. He was asked if he
would go on another polar enterprise,
and he threw up his hands and, laugh
ing, shouted "No." Then he added,
musingly, in his peculiar English: "Un
less special circumstances arise."
ATTORNEY BLAIR SAYS
IT IS AN OUTRAGE
CHICAGO, Sept. 30.â Attorney Frank P.
Blair, who assisted in defending Captain
Carter, was visibly affected as he read
the Washington dispatch announcing' that
President McKinley had approved the
findings of the court-martial. Hi
claimed: "It's an outrage. It is equal to
the Jjreyfus case. This is the lirst inti
mation 1 have had of the approval vi" the
President. The case is now beyond legal
intervention, as the verdict stands and
cannot be changed.
"My opinion of the matter never has
changed, and I think never will. It w.is
a conspiracy. The court-martial willfully
and flagrantly disobeyed the law. Tes
timony which should never have been ad
mitted was accepted, and that which was
clearly entitled to be brought in was a
eluded. Captain Carter was convict
: perjured testimony, as the defense clearly
I proved. Dreyfus was condemned on
say. Wherein lies the difference? The
principal witness for the prosecution was
1 easily caught in the cross-examin;
and yet he was allowed to go on, and ><n
his testimony alone Captain Carter was
! condemned. This injustice to an innocent
I man shows that the court-martial is m-
I terly unfit to grapple with the questions
j involved in a case of this kind. In my
'â¢â  estimation a majority of the members ot
I the court-martial \v< re honest in th
' lief of Carter's euilt. They were induced
to find the captain guilty in the main be
! cause of the perjured testimony of the
j Government witnesses."

and perhaps personal relations, the pres
ent representatives were getting along : :
harmoniously and there was no reason to !
anticipate any difficulty. It will be no
ticed that Â«h!s authoritative statement
flatly contradicts th*Â» entire German press.
There are rumors of a new Cabinet
crisis. The prediction that either Prince I
Hohenlohe or Dr. Miquel. or both, will j
have to go is characterized by the semi- j
official Berliner Correspondenz as based
on air.
Tlv correspondent of the Associated
Press hears authoritatively that the
Emperor earnestly desires to retain the
existing' Cabinet and to re-establish the :
old relations with the Conservatives, al
though he deems it absolutely necessary
to reorganize the corps of political and
Government officials, so far as those who
are in a position to sway and influence
opinion so that they may form a veritable
bulwark for th Government on all im
portant occasions. The correspondent
also hears from the same source that
the Emperor has not Riven up the an
of passing the canal bill, but intend to
modify it so as to render the measure
more palatable to the Agrarians of the
eastern provinces by providing- adequate
compensations in the shape of large ap
propriations for regulating- and Improv
ing the Vistula, Oder. Havel and Spree.
These appropriations figure up to some
fifty million marks. The Agrarian news
papers In the meantime declare that until
they see definite plans for really adequate
compensation for Eastern Prussia they
will remain against the canal bill.
The Associated Press correspondent
hears on good authority that a powerful
company, composed of French, German
and Russian capitalists, with a capital of
over J."O.CHH),OQO, has been formed for the
I purpose of competing with the American
pork importers in Europe, particularly in
Germany Jind Scandinavia. The plan Is
to raise hogs on a large scale in Siberia.
It is claimed that this can be â¢no cheaper
than in the Unit States. The hogs will
be shipped ally over the Siberian rail
way to the northwestern frontier of Rus
sia [ wh^rr- immense slaughter houses on |
the American plan will be established.
The pork'wlll be sent by water to English
ports and by rail to Germany and Scandi
navia.' In spite of the enormous distance,
it is asserted that such Siberian pork can
be. brought to Europe cheaper than Amer
ican pork. This, it la pointed out, is due
to the low. cost of production in Siberia
and the cheapness of transportation on
the railroads.
Professor Stiles, the scientific attache
of the' United States Embassy here, re
cently discovered evidence that several
large Antwerp rums did an immense busi
ness in. diseased beef and pork which was
put in American packages Illegally ob- j
tamed., thus giving them an Am<-rican.
brand. The professor is now traveling In j
Switzerland. Germany and Denmark in i
order to complete the chain of evidence
for the purpose of prosecuting these firms.
The long deferred trial if the Club der
Harmlosen case begins Monday and will
probably last a week If It is not adjourned.
It will cause quite a sensation, as the
witnesses and defendants nearly ali be
long to the aristocracy, there being forty
counts, barons and princes and as many
army officers among them. Three of the
principal defen&antsJare Herr Hans yon
Kroescher, nephew of â¢ he President of fht;
Diet; Herr Paul yon Bcheartmi and
Herr Kruno yon Kaiser, who is a Gov
ernment official. The worst offender, a
professional gambW named Wolff, has
disappeared.

I am convinced," said Mr. Whitney,

iraotor an experience to preside over
development. Dewey gave us the Phll

"H*> understands thesituation a. c no other

BRIEF OF STANDARD
OIL COMPANY FILED
COLUMBUS. Sept. 30.â Standard !
Oil Company to-day filed Its brief in the I
contempt case now pending In the Su
preme Court. It claims that in pursuance
of th( order of the court, entered March ]
2, 1892, it had a meeting of its stockhold- j
ers and that a large number of lrdi
vlduals surrendered their trust certificates
in exchange for Ftock In the defendant
company, those who have not done so
being excluded from the management of
thp corporation and no dividends having
been paid them. The defendant stock-
holders are not parties to any trust agree- !
ment, nor have they become such since
the decision of the court. The right of
tlse stockholders, as individuals, to hold
stock In other companies, Is insisted upon.
nn<l the Standard Company demands to
be treated In the hearing of the contempt
case as if there were no other companies
engaged in the oil business.

CONSUMPTION QUARANTINE.
" j "HE tentative action of our State Board of
I Health in regard to a quarantine of consump
* lives has had the very desirable effect of pro
ducing discussion of the subject.
The Call has reproduced the comments of four
teen newspapers, representing large centers of popu
lations, from Salt Lake to Boston. Of these eight
oppose and six favor the quarantine idea in some
form.
We have no doubt that if in the cities where oppo
sition appears it were proposed to rigidly isolate
i !-(â¢> of consumption, putting them under some form
vi police oversight to -it that the isolation is per
fect, these same newspapers would make no objec
tion, because the precaution would be for the protec
tion ot the communities in which they circulate.
The New Kngland States had a system designed to
protect municipalities against the support of indigents,
by which a man. no matter what the condition of his
fortune, was compelled to secure m some form a
municipality to which he went as a stranger against
any burden arising in his possible indigence. In
many of the most enlightened Western States there
i'sed to be .1 "black code." which denied access to
lree ne"roir-< unless they could give security, in some
cases running to their moral conduct as well as against
tHeir possible indigence.
Now. a!! of thrse regulations were, in effect, a
quarantine against certain classes fur the financial
protection of the public treasury. In their day tin-re
was a necessity for them or they would not have ex
isted. They were recognized as a legitimate use of
the police power.
It is a maxim of civil government that the public
health and welfare is the supreme law, and under our
.system ot government each State must judge lor itself
when and how to apply that maxim. There" is noth
ing in the Federal constitution which forbids a State
quarantine, and the undented power to establish it is
freely used against smallpox, cholera and yellow fever.
The power being undented, if the necessity of its
- ' blished, the tentative proposition of our
Roard of He;ilth must be discussed on the line of its
ity and its benefit.
As to the necessity, that depends upon the recog
nition by science of consumption as a disca c c so
certainly and dangerously infectious as to be pre
ventable by quarantine precautions. We are not prs

FINANCIAL LEGISLATION.
"T^HERE is a growing feeling that Congress will
be willing to go even farther in financial legis
lation than the conclusions reached last spring
by the caucus committee.
Those conclusions related to the basic conditions
of a financial system, and proposed putting under it
the sure foundation of the gold standard. Such ac
tion fixes the par redemption of all forms of currency
n; gold, and plants the public credit immovably upon
that basis. While the law now fixes gold as the unit
of value, the declaratory resolutions of Congress per
mit the redemption of the public debt in coin, either
gold or silver. This admits that such circumstances
may arise, and they would come unforeseen and sud
denly, under which payment in silver would smite the
credit of the United States in a fatally vital spot.
With such a gap between the nominal and actual
value of the standard silver dollar as has existed since
the silver tinkering began with the Bland bill, there
is left under credit a mine to be exploded by any
financial accident. Therefore the proposed legislation,
finally definitive of a financial foundation, is highly
meritorious. But everywhere this year there is an
obvious strengthening of the purpose of the Repub
lican party to stand by the sound money colors under
which it won in 1806. The persistence of the free sil
ver movement among the Bryan Democracy is
equally indicative of the determination of the oppo
sition to persist in its policy.
The Republican party may read an instructive les
son from its own experience. In iSyo and 1892 it
went down in dusty wreck with its tariff policy in
splinters. But it persisted, even in the face of defec
tion and loss. It saw the strength of the opposition
grow and gain in the Senate seat alter seat from what
had appeared to be impregnably Republican States.
But the party persisted, and in 1896 it rose, repaired,
from its wreck and refreshed by its rest from power,
and has marched forward until there is not left a
straight Democratic Senator from a Northern State,
and there are six Republican* Senators from the
South.
There is but little danger now. But the prosperity
which favors the party may change. Only 2. dog
matist will deny the fact in the history of financial
panics that they come under all revenue systems,
under tariffs for protection and tariffs for revenue, and
to the business of all countries, regardless of their
form of government. The current flush times are not
an American specialty. Our masterly gain in foreign
trade is not caused by prosperity at home alone, but
by prosperity abroad which stimulates commercial
exchange and enables the world to buy what we have
to sell. Kngland and the Continental nations are
ilourfching. The portentous advance in the metal
trades is not peculiar to us. It is general in all the
iron and steel countries. Confidence is high and
general, and speculation has caught its inspiration.
There are all the conditions which imply a reaction.
It may be long deferred, but some time it will come.
Confidence is like a man in a balloon, who looks ap
as he rises and feels no fear. But when high in the
air he looks down and trembles. So the trading and
financial world looks ahead and not back for a long
time, until it faces to the rear, trembles, stops, ami
there is a panic.
When this time comes, unless we have strength
ened our financial system, the scenes of iSg.} will be
repeated, and the Federal treasury, which is yet suf
fering an annual deficit, will be in the same condition
to which it was plunged by the last panic. Then, with
the silver movement as persistent as was protection
among the Republican-, who can say that it will not
succeed and inoculate our fiscal system with a septic
influence which will make it permanently infirm?
lt is the duty of the Republican party to make that
system immune to bubonic politics. The legislation
â¢ to that end. and if Congress shali
choose to .;:'> farther, and by simplifying our whole
body of currency and adapting a banking system to
the needs of the country, making it strong enough to
weather any storm, it i^ easy to that the conse
quences of loss of confidence will he greatly limited
and a panic may be a slight storm instead of a cy
clone like [893.
The present season seems to be pretty tough on
dentists. At this writing the Grand Jury is investi
ng Tooth-puller Gedge, the State Board of Dental
Examiners is on the trail of Dr. Tebbets, and the
powers at Union Park have told Dr. G: W. Leek to
his teeth that he has been engaged in the business â 
preparing dope for greyhounds. The profession will
do its best to bridge over the dark days.
JUSTICE TO THE SOUTH.
SOUTHERN newspapers complain with a con
siderable show of justice that while every lynch
law outrage in a Southern State is displayed is
a sensation in the news of the day and made use of
by a considerable number of Northern papers as an
occasion for denouncing the Southern people, little or
no attention is given in either the news or the edi
torial columns to the efforts made in the South to
eradicate race antagonisms, enforce law and put a
stop to lynching.
The Savannah News cites the recent Delegal inci
dent in Georgia as a case in point. When the dis
turbances at Darien took place over the attempt to
arrest Delegal and threats of lynching were made by
certain classes of the whites the affair was heralded
far and wide as a race war, but as soon as the law
was enforced the issue was dropped and no credit
given to the State authorities by the outside critics
who had been so busy in condemning what they called
the lawlessness of the South. "We have so far failed
to see." it says, "any comments in the Northern
papers upon the fact that the State of Georgia put
her-elf to thousands of dollars of expense, ordered
out the militia and convened two special terms of
court in order to secure safety and justice to a negro
charged with assault upon a white woman, and that
in the end a jury of white men found the negro not
guilty of the crime alleged and restored to him his
liberty."
The justness of a complaint of the kind is not to be
questioned. Lurid reports of Iynchings tend to pro
duce the impression that many Southern communi
ties arc relapsing into something like barbarism and
that life and property are not secure. Reports of
that nature are harmful to a community in more ways
than one. for they seriously impede its industrial and
commercial ' advancement, and the South, being in
need of an increase of population and of capital, is
the more injured by any false impression produced
among the people of the North concerning its social
conditions.
The relations between the whites and the blacks of
Southern Georgia are bad enough even upon the
showing msde by the News. A community in which
the Governor has to call out the militia, convene two
special terms of court and put the State to thousands
j of dollars of expense for the purpose of securing to
I a citizen his'right of trial by jury-, is certainly not the
most law-abiding community in the world, and is
! justly subject to a pood deal of criticism in the North
I and the West, wUcre better conditions prevail. Never
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, OCTOBER I, 1899.
theless, it is only fair to direct attention to the fact
that the law was enforced and the i.egro did receive
a fair trial and an acquittal.
The Southern, papers, however, are in error when
they assume that the loud denunciation of lynching
taken in connection with the comparative silence in
the Northern press when the law is enforced is a
proof of prejudice against the people of the South.
There is no such prejudice of sectionalism left in any
considerable portion of the Northern people. It is
well understood by all intelligent Northern men that
Southern people have" a difficult problem to deal with
in the antagonism of races, and there is a wide sym
pathy with them. Every effort made by Southern offi
cials to enforce law and keep in order the unruly ele
ments of both races is noted with more than ordinary
satisfaction. It is desirable that every portion of the
Union be prosperous and peaceful, and much has
been done in the North to direct attention to the
progress of Southern industries and the improvement
of Southern conditions. Such injustice as may have
been done in the discussion of lynching carries its
atonement with it. for it has had no other motive
than an ardent desire to have such outrages stopped
and to rouse the Southern people themselves to a
perception of the wrong done to their section by the
occurrence of such crimes.
FOR STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS.
POPULAR education in the United States has
developed a demand for a species of instruction
supplementing that given in schools and col
leges, which will enable the great mass of intelligent
men and women to pursue with success various
studies during the leisure moments- of their busy
lives. In response to that demand there have arisen
among our people all forms of literary and scientific
clubs and associations. The Chautauquan movement,
which is an outgrowth of that desire, has spread all
over the Union and become a national institution,
and now the enterprises of university extension are
giving their aid in the same direction.
All of these things attest the need of a daily help
to students and educators in the work of advancing
the general culture of the community. To supply
that help The Call has undertaken to publish a series
of courses of study every day except Sunday, and the
attention of all persons interested in general culture
is directed to the fact that the courses are not to be
"studies" in name only. Each course, as we have an
nounced, is to be under the direction of able masters
and recognized authorities on the subjects dealt with.
while the whole scries will be arranged and super
vised by Seymour Eaton, formerly of the Drexel In
stitute of Philadelphia.
The papers will be of course interesting to the
casual reader, but their main purpose is to serve the
genuine and earnest student. The teachers of our
public or private schools and colleges, the members
of literary- or scientific clubs and of the Chautauquan
and university extension societies, and all who prose
cute home studies, will be well repaid by a careful
study of the papers. It is. in fact, to that class of the
community the articles will most potently appeal. It
will not require a university education to be able to
follow them with understanding, but none the less
even the best read students will find in them much
that is instructive as well as entertaining.
Students of Shakespeare, for example, will have an
opportunity of reading in The Call on each Monday
and Thursday articles written by such men as Pro
fessors Dowden of Dublin University. Albert S. Cook
of Yale. Hiram rorson of Cornell, Isaac Demmon of
the University of Michigan. Hamilton W. Mabie of
the Outlook, and William J. Kolfe. whose edition of
Shakespeare is well known to all students. In the
department of American history there are to be
paper? every Friday by such authorities as John
Bach McMaster of the University of Pennsylvania,
Albert Bushnell Hart of Harvard, Charles H. Smith
of Vale, Bernard C. Steiner of the Pratt Library of
Baltimore, and Andrew C. McLaughlin of the Univer
sity of Michigan.
The articles on the world's great artists, which are
to be published every Tuesday, will be contributed by
John C. Van Dyke. lecturer on art at Columbia and
rd: A. L. Frothingham Jr.. professor of art .it
Princiton; Russell Sturgis and Arthur Hoeber. the
eminent art critics of New York, and Frank Fowler,
one of the leading artists of that city. The papers
on home science and household economy are to be
furnished by such noted women as Mrs. Helen Camp
bell. Margaret E. Sangster and Kate Gannett Wells,
and Misses Lucy Wheelock and Anna Bar
rows. Those papers are to be published on Saturdays,
while on each Wednesday there are to be two papers,
one dealing with desk studies for girls and the other
with shop and trade studies for boys.
The usefulness to educators and students of the
daily publication of studies on such subjects by emi
nent writers and thinkers can hardly be overrated.
They will materially advance the movement for the
general culture of the community, and to most of our
readers will be one of the most valued features of The
Call.
The destructive tendencies of certain members of
the Board of Education have reached such a stage as
to make them matters of public concern. While they
were busily engaged in shattering their own reputa
tions there was no particular reason for unrest, but
now, according to the testimony of their associates,
they are demolishing public school property and
should be hauled up with a round turn.
A San Jose litigant has developed a most peculiar
notion of the commercial value of wifely affection.
His wife deserted him after announcing, with some
emphasis, that the only thing more she wanted to
see of him. in remembrance, was his death notice.
After that he sued the other fellow for $10,000 for
robbing him of his wife's comfort and society.
Recent actions of Secretary Root knock the props
from under rumors to the effect that General Corbin
and not he is the man in the War Department. Dis
patches arc to the effect that the Secretary has iust
purchased a high-priced Kentucky thoroughbred and
will soon be â if he is not now â in the saddle.
Author Constantine Demetrak of Oakland claims
to be a Spartan, but his recent actions do not bear

The infuriated Spanish gentleman of Lemoorr who
tried to sever the matrimonial bond between himself
and his wife by carving his spouse will probably have

Two directors of the Melrose school district engaged

EDITORIAL
VARIATIONS
BY JOHN McNAUGHT.
A young woman of an intense emo
tional nature, with an ardent, ambi
tious intellect, possessing, it appears,
many finÂ« faculties but lacking the sav
ing one of common sense, in a stress of
excitement lost her reason and her
strength and was committed last week
to Agnews asylum as an insane patient,
where she died. For some time before
her insanity manifested itself she had
been a student of Christian Science and
a votary of its doctrines. On that show
ing a considerable number of the people
of the neighborhood have come to the
conclusion she was rendered insane by
the philosophy ?hÂ« was studying, and
they have found means to make some
thing staitlingly sensational of the case
and to raise a clamor against Christian
Science and all its teachers.
In that same asylum at Agrnews there
i was for many years â and may be yet,
j for all I know â a young woman of ar
| dent mind, who, while a student at the
j State Normal School at San Jose, be
| came insane from a strain upon the
j brain brought about by overstudy and
i lack of proper recreation and nourish
j ment. Now let us have another sensa
i tion and raise a cry against the Normal
i School, demanding the suppression of
the teaching of those who believe in the
education of girls.

Call a doctrine "Christianity," and
! the common world will listen to it with

more than a traditional superstition
handed down from the dark ages of the
human intellect. Call a doctrine "sci

i it with an equal toleration, though it
I teach by precept there is no soul, and \

' grown used to their rivalries and their
i fights, and it appears to most of us a
natural condition of the world that they
; should go on fighting. The thinkers
who are trying to fuse the two into a
rational system of Christian Science are
I therefore regarded as enemies of soci
! ety, hardly more respectable than the
men who try to organize fusion parties
in politics, and the average man who
i has never given a serious thought to
Christianity, science or Christian Sci

party would endanger the chances of
both the old parties, so the new philoso

the destruction of both science and

be found in the thousand vagaries '
preached and practiced in the names of
religion and of science. During the cur
rent discussion of the strife in the Phil
ippines what pranksorne preaching has
there been! Here is a case fresh from â 
the Republican convention in Nebraska. .
To that body there came the Rev. Mr.
Mailey, who made a speech, prefacing it
with the statement: "I am no politician
âsimply a preacher." His speech was
an insistent demand for the prosecution
of the war against the "enemy we are
trying to save and civilize." and in the I
course of it the usual declaration In j
favor of fighting for the flag, "right or
wrong." When that doctrine is shouted I
from the mouths of irresponsible lay- \
men it hardly means more than that
such people are careless alike of the j
principles of justice and the honor of i
the nation; but when a man speaking |
professedly as a Christian preacher
proclaims the creed it is time for the
church to get after him. If a declara
tion in favor of war. "right or wrong,"
be not heresy in the church of Christ,
then there is no heresy in that church
and very little of Christ.

I make the suggestion of heresy
charges against the war spouters of the
pulpit with no intention of taking pert
in any controversy that might arise
from the trial of such a charge. I can
well imagine what a splutter there
â¢would be if a church should assert that
obedience to Christ is more imperative

upon men than devotion to the flag,
and that when a nation goes wrong it is
the duty of the church to withstand it.
There would then be indeed that sepa
ration of church from state which we
all so loudly profess to desire, and as a
consequence there would be a ruction
of immense proportions, for it is an in
variable rule that when men are grant
ed their desires there is always a row.
If we have faith In religion we must
believe it possible to educate a Filipino
without killing all his relatives and re-
I dueing him to servitude; but if we have
charity for all men we must tolerate the
war-breathing pi-earner and concede
his right to practice Christianity by
blood and slaughter. In a recently
published letter Mrs. Elizabeth Bar
rett Browning said:
"In our age faith and charity are
foundâ but they are usually found
apart. T\'e tolerate everybody because
we doubt everything; or else we toler
atr nobody because we believe some
thing. Largeness of intellectual vision
becomes indistinctness in the apprehen
sion of outline, just as the case is in
physical near-sightedness."
Mrs. Browning is dead and her age is
dead with her, but the old problem re
mains; and what is perplexing the
brains of our debating societies is to
find out how we can have faith In "our
national mission" and still indulge
a oh: ri''bie 'respect for the religion of
our Infancy.

San Jose has undertaken to entertain
the State with a Brand Jubilee in com
memoratlon of tho fiftieth anniversary
of th organisation of the Government
of California as a State, which took
place in that city December 20, 1849; If
my memory be not in error the body
that organized iho Government we are
now so proud of. in that beautiful
pueblo on that auspicious occasion, is
known to fame as "The Legislature oÂ£
a Thousand Drinks." The moderation
of the men of that tiny is amazing. A
thousand drinks would not last ;i Legis
lature of our time even a little while.
That many would be poured out in liba
tions on the first appearance of Ma
zuma. The title, however, is full of
pleasant suggestions, and if San Jose
carry her patriotic endeavor through it
is a safe prediction that every promise
the phrase suggests will be fully real
ized to the visitor who goes there thirst
ing for joy.
In all earnestness, there is no better
place for a December festival in all the
world than that selfsame San Jose, for
if the rains come and the Coyote and
the Los Gatos overflow there can be a
Venetian fete, and if it do not rain
there can be an Elysian frolic, starting
from the city and spreading all over
the surrounding country to San Jose's
farthest suburbs, Oakland and Gllroy.
The climate of the district was ordained
of heaven for the delight of man, and
the people who live in it have expanded
in all good things until they have be
come the best hosts and finest compan
ions good fellowship can desire. It was
once the capital of the State, and ha 3
a good right to celebi.ite its past hon
ors. The festival of a thousand drinks
will be a halcyon and vociferous time
indeed, and he who wishes not to take
all hi.-s thousand in wine may drink in
patriotism and hospitality and thÂ«
beauty of fair women. It is to be hoped
the undertaking will prosper, for there
is virtue in it.

CHIEF LEES IS
PERPLEXED AT
EVERY POINT
Unable to Cope With
an Evil.
â Â» â
BOAST OF NYMPHIA SCHEMERS
â¢
DARE THE POLICE TO STOP THE
TRAFFIC.
â¦
The Chief, Placed Between Two Fires,
Is Forced Into Inactivity and
Subterfuge to Evade Re
sponsibility.
The Hotel Nympbia has become an af
frighting nightmare to Chief of Police
Lees. Whichever way the venerable head
of the Police Department turns, he must
face a complication that he cannot sim
plify. If he closes the notorious estab
lishment he will be forced to shut the
doors of every similar resort in the city,
and that Is a task that he is unwilling
and unable to undertake. If he permits
the Nymphia to continue its traffic he
brings down upon his head the condem
nation of people who cannot tolerate open
and disgusting vice without a protest.
If the perplexed Chief takes the hazard
ous, stand of claiming that social vice is
inevitable in a large city and should be
concentrated, then to be consistent he
force all of the scattered resorts to
mobilize within a certain district.
However the Chief may act, he cannot
meet the conditions which face him. If
he attempts to please the church element
and decent people he will offend the other
nt and increase the mass of diffi
culties that already surround him. The
has come to- the conclu
sion that he will let thr situation take
care of itself, and as developments come
lo >k for an opening to 'escape. He has
done nothing and intends to do nothing.
la . .:â¢ â¢ xplanatlon of his activity.
The controversy reached a climax at the
! last meeting of the Police Commission-
I he subject was discussed. Chief
Lees hart shown something of a disposi
tion to respect the wishes of the decent
le who protest against the existence
01 a moral ulcer in their midst. What
ever view may be taken of the case, these
people are righteously up fn arms against
â  the plague spot. When the members of
the Twinkling Star Companyâ those genial
j K'-ntlemen who earn their bread by a
traffic in human fleshâ heard that the
Chief was contemplating a raid upon
them they sent a letter to the Police
Commissioners.
This letter is the thorn In the Chief's
Bide. The immbers of the Twinkling Star
C"inpiny are brutally frank In an admls
of their loathsome business. They
. however, that :f the Chief of Police
the Hot Xymphla he must also
her similar resort In the
; city or submit to the natural imputation
Heed in favor of some. And
more than this, to add trouble to the dln
tress of the Chief, the Nymphia outtlt
es Itself to assist the police In every
ble was to close the other houses
drive the inmates away.
This the Chief cannot <10, even If he
ted i" do bo. The Twinkling Star
Company pretends no decency In its prop
n. 'it realizes very thoroughly that
it is in a disgusting business and has
sition to the authorities
y a;-- a club. It maintains that as
long as the traffic in which, through
ts, it has engaged is not legalized,
licensed and conditioned no discrimination
can be shown. This contention would
â  ly no merit were it n'>t for
thai the < Jhief of Police i annot
j close the other establishments which â â¢!'-
I iblic as seriously as the Hotel
. Nyrnpl
What the outcome will be Is a matter of
conjecture. The obnoxious hotel may be
. the ground that it is In a bad
. Ition, but the issue t\ 111
never be thoroughly m&t on this basis.
The Chief, with that exquisit<- tact of
risibility from hirnst>: f. la
ilth authorities full swing
â ' please, bui whatever they
(in must be by necessity only a temporary
relief. Meai c< nt residents <>t
the d n which the vile hotel is
ted are crying to the police to save
th( m and their children from daily scenes
of flagrant vice.
Health Board Refuses to Act.
Under the protecting wing of the police
j the Board of Health again inspected the
Hotel Nymphia last night. The investi
! gation was thorough and a majority of
rs believe that they have no
power to close the place because of its
tary condition. Dr. Keeney was the
only member who thought th<Â» place was
unsanitary, and his police affiliations ex
plain his position. His associates In the
I of Health believe that Chief Lees
is trying to evade his own responsibility
and make- catspaws of them, and they
will not submit to the imposition.

WESTERN TRIP OF
PRESIDENT M'KINLEY
He Will Visit the Principal Cities of
Minnesota, South Dakota
and lowa.
OMAHA. Xebr., Sept. 30.â A private
dispatch from Washington received to
day crates that President McKinley has
practically decided upon his itinerary, and
tlmt it includes Sioux Falls, in Eastern
South Dakota. Sioux City, lowa, and
Omaha Prior to the tour east through
lov. a. President McKinley proposes to
make visits to other towns in the Hawk
eye State, but he Is willing to see how
much territory he can cover in the time
set for his visit to the Northwest. In
a general sense the itinerary of his visit
to Minnesota, South Dakota and lowa is
made up, but there are so many gaps in
it which will admit of deflections from
routes now decided upon at the White
House that a run down to Omaha can
easily be made. A dispatch from Sioux
Falls says:
"It is announced here positively that the
President will visit this city."

A FRENCH CAP NESTLES
ON HER POMPADOUR ROLL
gj HERE Is consternation In the ranks of the Palace Hotel chambermaids.
0 |[-^ This morning, without regard to complexion, classical features and the 0
*â¢ other charming attributes of bed-making young- women of the huge Â»?
0 j^ caravansary, each mother's daughter that wields a feather duster must O
S* blossom out in air the glory of a French cap and huge white apron. 'ââ¢
0 The edict went forth on Thursday last. After much mature consideration 0
â¢5 and deep research the management notified the housekeeper of the swelled i?
0 kink in exclusive chambermaiddom and decided that they must. have it. The 0 i
â¢5 housekeeper notified her twenty-eight maids and they, without any consider- SS
O atlon at all, said it was "a mean, nasty shame"' and declared- that they O
â¢* wouldn't. "So there." Then the girls got together and talked "capital and â¢$
jQj labor," "chambermaid unions," said big â¢ things about "oppression" and the 0
j5 "badge of servitude" and wound up with a philosophic "bide a wee and ' Â«5
8 you will see." o'/ â â  -S-'/v:,;. â ''%
A There has been : some talk about a chambermaid strike, but nothing dis- J>
m* astrous thus far, however, .has resulted from the new rule. The girls are too Â£â¢
O. occupied as to the "proper set" of the cap and the symmetry-destroying 0
5* properties of the huge apron to do anything definite just at present. "It's a â¢*
ff badge of .servitude that is offensive to an American girl," they all unite in 0
â¢-* declaring; but whether or no it can be worn with a "pompadour roll" none j3
Â£â¢ feel in a position to declare. 8
A "Look' at me nose," said a buxom maid, who gives her attention to the a
%% rooms on the third floor. "It points to heaven. And me .hair is red, and you %%
0.. can't say without falsifying that' I haven't a bit of brogue. And a Frinch cap 0
â¢* on me. Oh, me! Oh, my! Do you blame me or wonder?" 25
0 "It isn't the cap," said a sweet-faced, dark-eyed fourth-floor chamber- 0
m* maid. "It's the apron! A regular nursegirl's apron. What's the use of hay- 'â¢*
0 ing a figure?" â¢ â¢ $
m' "Oh, those girls make me tired," volunteered the elevator boy, who stood *'
'& by and listened to the girl with the brogue and the girl with the. figure. &
â¢* "Don't we fellows wear uniforms? Ain't we as good as them girls? The 25
0. management says git brass buttons on your suits and we does. You got to 0
S* mind th-e management.'.' .â¢
0 The management of the Palace has no reason to offer for the new rule *QJ
g that has so disturbed the chambermaids. Caps and aprons prevail throughout' V
H the East and are worn by the maids in all the fashionable establishments. The < â¢
A Palace management, sees no reason why the West/should not fall in line with <$

PERU'S REBELLION ON
VERGE OF COLLAPSE
Revolutionists Are Without Object
and Are Offering to Lay Down
Their Arms.
Special Cable to The Pall and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gor
(lc.n Bennett.
LIMA, Peru, Sept. SO.â President Ro
mana has ordered that the prefect of de
partment. Juhln, who, it is alleged, has
been guilty "1 many abuses and crimes,
shall be tried. This conduct has Increased
President Romana's popularity. The gen
eral sentiment is that the revolution is
without object. The revolutionists are of
fering to lay down their arms If the Gov
ernment will give them a guarantee of
Immunity. Probably in fifteen days more
the revolution will be quashed.
National Guard Election.
STOCKTON, Sept. 30.â The headquarters
of the Sixth Regiment will probably ie

W. R. Johnson was elected colonel and
Gus G. Grant lieutenant colonel this even
ing, but not without a contest for vne
second position of field officer. The se
lection of Colonel Johnson was . made
unanimous, but it took three votes to de
cide who would wear the lieutenant
colonel's shoulder straps. The vote was
nine for Captain Jones of Fresno to
eleven for Major Grant of this city. The
officers attended the fair at the pavilion
in a body and were serenaded by the
band. I^ater Colonel Johnson banqueted
them at an uptown restaurant.
DRAGGED TO HIS
DEATH BY CAR'S
LACK OF FENDER
Man Roughly Rolled
Twenty Feet.
Electric car Ncx 578 0f .the "Ellis-H
street lino ran over and killed a man saidH
to be Patrick Magulre on Fourth streetl
at the crossing of Stevenson about 10:3(m
o'clock last night. There were about
dozen passengers on the car when theH
killing took place. Many persons wereH
passing, along Fourth street and saw tl>eH
happening. All accounts given by specta-M
tors agree that the victim was drags*
from twelve to twenty feet after the cat-H
struck him. The car had a fender, imtH
it was entirely inadequate to the scrviceH
required of it. Had it been effective there!
would not have been another name to addH
to- the long death roll of the Market-streetM
Railway Company's victims of parsimony!
this morning. The victim was crossing!
Fourth street from the east side, boing!
about on the north line of Su-vi-ii.-ri.nMJ
street. The testimony of bystanders dif-H
fers concerning his sobriety. One sayaH
that ho was drunk; another insists posi-H
tively that he was sober.
E. 1... Young of 235 Third street saw theHJ
whole occurrence. He was standing
the west Fide of Fourth street when thoH
car turned into Fourth street from
ket. According to Mr. Young's story iheHJ
car was not going very fast. The gripmun.H
T. A. Bishop, was. ringing his bell, milH
Mr. Young thought that Bishop 'lid notH
see the man in front of the car crns.stngH
the street. "1 think that the man whoH
was hit was perfectly sober," said Mr.l
Young. "He crossed the street slowly,
and perhaps he did not hear the ! >â¢'!!.â 
There was no other vehicle coming nlongH
just then, and I heard the bell very wi'll.H
1 was horrified when the accident tookH
place. The man who was struck went!
down at once. He rolled and was dragged!
about the width of Stevenson street bo-!
fore the car could be stopped. As soon - ts
the gripman felt the shock of the rolli-H
sion he put on the brakes as hard as
could. After being dragged the man wont!
under the fender and the front
one or both, went over him. He made no
noise that 1 heard after he was struck."
William Hartnutt, who lives at 118 Sixth
street, was also standing opposite the
spot where the accident took place. He
says that he first noticed the unfortunate
man coming across Fourth street He did
not come from Stevenson street. Judging
from the direction he was first taking, he
had been in a saloon, and he staggi red
The bell on the electric car was ringing.
Hie motorman put on the brakes hard
just before the car struck him. "After
he was struck he was rolled and drugged
before he went under the fender. Then
one wheel of the car went over him .mil
the weight of the car rested upon him and
the car Had to be pushed back to get him
out. He made no noise after he went
down, which makes me think that he
was stunned. He acted to me like an old
man."
T. O. Tormish of 110 Congress street
Sunnyside. Joseph Allen of 106S Howard
street. Tr.m Nolan of ili> Pore street and
A. May of the Hancock House all saw th"
accident. They agree very well on the
very essential point that the fender was
not effective.
After the accident the police took the
victim to the Receiving Hospital He was
dead when he got there and was proba
bly dead when he was taken from under
the car. His body was carried to the
Morgue.
An hour after the accident the motor
man and the conductor of the car were
arrested. Bishop, the motorman, was
charged with manslaughter. His story of
the happening is that he gave the warn
ing bell, but it was not heard. He tried
his best to stop, but could not in time
although he claims that he was running
at a low rate of speed. The fender ac
cording to his version, pushed the victim
aside, but turned him under the car step
and he was then cut by one of the wheels.
The conductor had nothing to say
The only means of identification" found
on the person of the dead man was a
key ring inscribed "Patrick Magulre, San
Francisco, Cal.," and a Grand Army but
ton. One arm was slightly crippled".
"Advice," said T'ncle Eben, "is hahd to
manage. If you gives it away you doesn'
git no benefit, an' if you sells it you's
gwin?ter spile de quality tryin' to please
customers." â Washington Star.

Special Cable to The Call and the New York
I Herald. Copyrighted, 1599. by James Gor-
I don Bennett. .
PARIS, Sept. 30.â General de Gallifet,
says the Figaro, has just obtained the
signature of the President to a decree in-
Etltuting a most important reform in the
French army. Hitherto nominations for
promotion of colonels or officers of a
higher rank in the French army, or for
promotion in the Legion of Honor, have
been made by commission. In the fu
ture the selection of officers for promo
tion will be in the hands of the Minister
of War, who is responsible to the Gov
ernment alone. In a report accompany
ing the decree which he submitted to his
colleagues at a Cabinet council held yes
terday General de Gallifet stated in his
usual plain, straightforward language his
reasons for the proposed reforms.
Nominations by commission and coun
cil, he says, practically impose upon the
Govornnu-'nt of the republic appointments
which it assumes responsibility with
|out having any choice in the matter. It
to complete the abandonment of its
|powf-rs on the part of the Government,
|which is merely executor of the will of a
|commission, composed of a few general
|oliicors who are not responsible to Par-
MJli;im>-nt. ' ' â 
In the eyes of those officers who rightly
|hope to attain the highest positions in the
â nriny the Government and the Minister of
|Wur are nothing; the Commission Su
|prcme de Classement is everything. This
contrary to all the rules of logic and
Hi'ni(if'iic>'. No parallel can be found in
|iiny other French Ministry or in any other
country. Any Minister of War who has a
proper appreciation of his duties and re-
Kponsibilities will refuse to exercise, his
functions under such conditions.
The decree, the keynote of which is
contained in the passage that the Minister
â of War alone decides the appointments
to be submitted at the council of Mln
|isters for the signature of the President
I ' l ' the republic, was signed by General
ll.h'ii.. : yesterday, and will appear in the
Journal Olliciel this morning.
In order to prove to the heads of the
Barmy that this regulation is not intended
H.:- a piece of special policy, but based on
solid reasons, General de Gallifet, says
|the Figaro, has decided not to put it into
fore- until all outstanding promotions
have been ratified.

McKenzie's Trial.
SUISUN, Sept. 30.â The prosecution
in the McKenzie murder trial has
nearly completed its case. The court
adjourned this afternoon to next Tues
day. This morning's session was spent
in an inspection of McKenzie's state
ment at the Coroner's inquest. T. L.
Hayman, foreman of the Coroner's
jury; E. N. Hotell, J. F. Wilson and P.
H. Lennon, also members of the jury,
were called to give testimony regarding
McKenzie's statement to the jury.
These witnesses were called by the
prosecution because of errors found In
the transcript of McKenzie's statement
by the defense. So far the case has de
veloped nothing new or sensational, but
the prosecution still hopes, by linking
different circumstances, to prove Mc-
Kenzie's guilt.

yachts that will, battle, for International
laurels during next- we.<=-k were visited' by

of cleaning the under; body of the yacht
and spent- the;, greater .part of. the day
jointing her- top .Fides:; ...This work was"
performed with the greatest care. After
the chlorV.was v .applied: it was rubbed
unrinth with water and th^n with pumice-
Htotie. - Afterward the men went over the
rritirefml! with cotton waste and removed
any patlcles of. pumice-stone that adhered
tn Hip metal :or paint. Piiggrers in the
meanwhile were Ht work fitting a brass
cap mi the topmast in order to facilitate

During the afternoon all the woodwork
and Interior fittings of the craft were
taken ashore and a big- iron crane lifted
the littiiiKs. pieces of. canvas and other
paraphernalia out ill a big box, which was
afterward stored In a storehouse.
Mr. Iselin was at the navy-yard during
the greater part of the day and showed

have the celebration during the week that the Grand Encampment of the State is
to hold its annual Bession. An outline of the details of the celebration has al
ready been published In The Call. It is expected Hint during that week there will
be about fifteen thousand strangers In the city, Odd Fellows and relatives.

HANK'S MEN
A Large Crowd Witnesses a
Rather Exciting
Game.
Hank's men walloped the Sand Craps I
yesterday at Recreation Park by a score j.
of 6 to 5 in the series of games now being
played by the two teams. for second place,.
The San Francises showed marked Im
provement in fielding and batting, '.and .at :
the conclusion of the game Hank threw [
Ills chest out and ventured the prediction;
that his hall â¢ iserS had a chance -to take ;
first honors from Sacramento. Up to the '
fourth inning the -blackboard showed a '
clean face. Then: Drennan, Clark and :
Streib went around: the bags, and matters J
looked blue for Frisco. In the fifth Uni- i
pire Graves had occasion to make a de- j
cisioti that comes once in ten years on j ;
a ball field. Williams slid to third so
hard that he kicked the bag from its
fastenings and it slid several feet away j
from the body. Riley beat him to it and ,
Graves ruled that : Williams had; to stay
with the bag. The decision, according to
the rules, was a just one, but th> rooters
heralded it with hoots and hisses.
The score was as follows: ;

all the ginger was eliminated. The vis

CALIFORNIA SCORES A VICTORY
AT FOOTBALL OVER THE OLYMPICS
tffy? LL. the members of the Olympic
II Yy Club eleven and the prime en
/* â A thuslast, Manager Leon S. Greene-
U \^, baum, said the team would win
the opening game of the season
with California. Now they are sorry that
they spoke so unqualifiedly. The clubmen
are In deep mourning and all Berkeley is
drinking in the deep draughts of an initial
victory. A touchdown and a goal was
California's record; the Olympics have
nothing for their efforts but mental pains
and bodily bruises.
The football season opened most auspi
ciously on the Berkeley football field yes
terday afternoon when the Olympic giants
mot the University eleven in the first
football contest of the year. A genuine
gridiron crowd had gathered. Men who
have played the game on the most famous
football field in the country were there
to shout and criticize. College students,
society women and clubmen filled the
stand orjjtheijwestern side of the field and
â¢Enthusiasm evidenced by much noise and
shouting was tfot lacking at any time dur
ing the game. Stanford was' represented
by a large contingent of football men.
Coach Chambcrlin, Captain Fisher,
Trainer Murphy and several of the team
were on the aide lines, watching with
critical eyes the weak and strong points
MAMIE G WON
THE HANDICAP
AT OAKLAND
Hohenzoilern Ran a Close
Second â Fine Day's Sport.
Owner Ruled Off.
Delightful summer weather and a rac
.ird that gave all previous onos of
â¢ â â Mng a sallow look attracted an
old fashioned Saturday crowd to Oakland
truck yesterday. Business in the betting
ring was especially lively and the talent
more than held its own with the books.
The different events were so well con
tested that the absence of the tardy ar
riving knights of the saddle and record
breaking equlnes still battling for pursee
on the other side of the hills was scarcely
cd. Three favorites met with de
teat
HThe mile and a sixteenth handicap, with
an afterpiece, captured by Caesar Young's
black mare Mamie <;. was a very excit
ing affair. Cromwell, allotted top weight,
VJi pounds, was installed favorite, with
The Fretter, Recreation, Hohenzollern
and Mamie G all receiving more or less
support. A tedious delay at the post
probably told on the favorite, for he was
never a contender. Once sent on their
journey little Walsh astride Silver Tone,
the outsider, tried pace making. His term
as a leader expired quickly, -for on the
back stretch Thorpe had Recreation in
front, with the closely bunched field at
her heels. The Burns & Waterhouse mare
was still leading as the stretch was
reached, Hohenzollern a close second.
Less than a furlong from the wire Recre
ation had "shot her bolt" and Hohenzol
lern looked all over a winner, when Co
burn slipped along next the rail -with
Mamie 'â¢â  and driving hard downed the
Boots entry less than a length. Recrea
tion bung on gamely, finishing lapped on
the leaders. The Fretter ran a disap
pointing race, "bloowing up" after show
nig a short turn of speed.
After the race F. J. O'Rourke. owner of
The Frrtter, created a scene in front of
the grand totand by assaulting Monroe
.i. son, a colored employe of the Oak
land association. Owing to the unruly
tactic h 'if two of the starters in the hand
icap, Johnson temporarily acted as as
sistant starter, and O'Rourke accused him
of holding his entry at the post, a base
less charge according to near by specta
tors. O Kourke was escorted from the
ctiurse by Morse* 'patrolman, and later
was placed under "arrest. The track of
ficials also took cognizance of his gross
breach of turf etiquette, for the obstrep
erous owner, together with his horses,
was ruled o lf the: turf.
Marplot with, his suspicious underpin
ning, emerged from seclusion and was one
of seven starters' in the first number, a
six-furlong Belling sprint. Opposed to him
were an' aff-.coiored assortment and at
odds on be won easily from Wilmeler, a
20 to 1 shot. Watossa disposed of Magnus
for the show. 'â 'â 
It begins to look as if Bogus Bill would
be town talk before the snow flies. The
good-looking Cyclone colt develops a new
kink of speed with each fresh appear
ance before the public, It would seem. In
â  the sprint for -two-year-olds over the Fu
turity course he fairly ran over the 8 to 6
choice, Ned Dennis, winning in a big gal
; lop. T. : Walsh, i\ promising youngster,
piloted him to excellent advantage. The
' late-comer, Enjoyment, was beaten only
a. scant head for the place.
. :. Jimmy |Coffey had Bernardino keyed to
lifgh'C and it was like breaking sticks
; for the -hooded- horse to defeat his com
pany .in .the seve,ri-furlong run. Ekldle
XSreanoy and : his: friends bet the hook
makers Mack In the face until the 2 to 1
; chalked up w : as swiped to 8 to 5. Jack
â¢'War.d had the leg up and flattering Chl
huahua with the front position until near-
I lh : g the bend : for home there assumea
[â the lead and -was; never"" headed. At the
: hist Morse on Donator came with a rush,
causing Ward to shake the favorite up a
trifle. Melkarth, an outsider.- ran third.
.';â¢:â¢ Popular Pat Morrlssey, a sizzling 4 to 5
:. choice, struck on a rock and foundered In
the' ckislng sprint at six furlongs. Pat

of California's play. Heftelflnger, the
towering Yale giant and the greatest
guard who ever played the game, visited
the team he' once coached and was sur
prised by a victory for the blue and gold.
Representing the Olympic Club, John
Hammersmith, Vice President Mann and
several of the directors walked up and
down the side lines, looking wise without
hazarding an opinion.
The game was exceptionally gqod for
an opener, though devoid of sensation,
dash or brilliancy. California, with lta
team of IS9S, played together and with
spirit, but no attempt was made to do
anything startling on the offensive. The
Olympic team, with Its stalwart weighty
linesmen, showed the want of game
practice and the onslaughts against the
California line rarely brought appreciable
gains. Victory for the Blue and Gold,
came by the plucking of an opportunity
which was the result of a fumble. By
excellent defensive work the Olympic Club
made a fixture of California three yards
from the goal and secured the ball. In
stead of punting it out of danger the sig
nal was given for Sheehy to take the pig
skin and break holes in the opposing line.
He found his opening and was about to
plunge down the field when the ball fell
out of his arms. "Whipple, who was com-
beating him a neck in 1:14 flat. Dr. Xem
bula was a starter in this event, but got
away from the post none too well and
was not a factor. He was heavily played
at post time.

Ing toward him In lurches. Ignored the
man for the pigskin, touched the latter
safely under the armpit and crossed the
line for the only touchdown of the game.
It was an accident, but no "fluke." If It
had not happened the gamÂ© would prob
ably have been a tie without a score on
either side.
A low kickoff by Moore started the
game a-golng. Clear to the Olympic fif
teen-yard line the pigskin went before it
waa "within reach of Olympic hands.
Back it came to California territory by
a punt of Thierkauf, which was not a
good one for distance. California then
tried Hall and made a ten-yard gain. In
the scrimmage that followed Pete Smith's
bad shoulder received a wrench that fin
ished him for the season and he was re
tired. Yard by yard California fought its
way through the Olympic line until they
were within fifteen yards of a touchdown,
but here the halt was called. Three un
successful line bucks gave the pigskin
to the club athletes and the hopes of
Cochran received a sudden blight.
But the Olympic team could do nothing
against the lighter California line, and
Thierkauf was forced to punt. Then be

attempts to shatter the opposition line

HALIFAX, N. S., Sept. 30.âMark Lynch,
the Halifax champion sculler, defeated
James A. Ten Eyck of Worcester and
James Xorris of Halifax in a three-mile
race in single skulls to-day, for a purse
of $300.
A little learning is less dangerous
than the belief that you know it all.
first half was fought for the main part
In Olympic territory. Just before the
whistle blew Sheehy broke out of the
bunch and made one of his old-time bucks
for twenty yards.
The second half gave the mighty Cad
wallader a chance to kick off. Hall
caught the ball and ran it In but a little
way and punted for thirty-five yards. An
other unsuccessful attempt of the Olym
pics to gain the necessary distance forced
them to kick. California then began a
punting game, and Moore's long drive
was fumbled by Clum, who entered the
game when Carter was packed off on ac
count of injury. Moore punted the ball
to the Olympic fifteen-yard line, and after
some successful and other unsuccessful
line bucking by the clubmen the college
team secured the ball on the Olympic
twenty-five-yard line.
Then followed the struggle for a touch
j down. "Locomoter" Smith put his driv
ers to work and went three yards closer
ito victory. Cadwallader in his anxiety to
upset the opposing formation interfered
with the passing of the ball, and five
j yards' penalty shortened the distance that
separated California's eleven from the
goal. A dash by Hall for ten yards and
another by Smith to the five-yard line
brought the scent of the line that marked

BOXER VAN BUSKIRK
WILL TRAIN HERE
The Man Who Is to Meet Heavy
weight Russell Establishes
Quarters at the Beach.
Theodore Van Buskirk, the California
heavy-weight boxer, who is to meet Rus
sell, the Oregon phenomenon, will take up
training (marten .it Seal Rock House to
morrow. He is already in good condition,
having done a lot of work, both on tho
road and in the gymnasium, at his home
in Marysville. Van Buskirk was severely
injured in a bout with Champion Jeffries
when the latter was making a start in
the pugilistic world. His wound did not
mend well, and a year ago he underwent
an operation. He has now fully recovered
the goal into the very nostrils of Califor
nia's rushers. But the score was not to
be right then. Three times was the Olym
pic line tried, and failure resulted. The
clubmen took the ball, and Greenebaum,
on the side lines, began counting his
' money.
What followed was the fortune and the
i misfortune of football. Thinking; that a
! sudden surprise would work good results.
! Code gave a signal for Sheeny, the strong
J and reliable line bucker, to forge ahead.
This he did, but dropped the ball at the
critical moment, and Whipple, Califor
nia's captain, carried it over the line.
Kaarsberg, who replaced Moore, kicked a
i goal.
After this the ball oscillated up and
down the field, with the honors breaking
even.

age, who are determined to lead
the life of a soldier and were

â¢were handed over to the custody of
the police yesterday afternoon on Fol

William Bird of Brorkport. N. V.;
William Campbell of San Jose, Harry

No story of scandal and crookedness In
volvlng State officials has created more
widespread excitement and Interest than
The Call's exclusive publication yesterday
morning of the barter and sale of notaries
public certificates. Many wi re not sur
prised at the expose. The better class or
citiiens are prepared to hear of â¢any crime
or any offense against decency in which
are associated the political criminals,
touts and beggars of the State who fol
low the Btandard of Dan M. Hums.
The Call's story yesterday was complete.
Little is to be added to the detail ot the
scandal. 11. T. Smith, one of the chief
offenders, has taken refuge in flight from
the scorn and condemnation of the peo
ple Assemblyman Dibble, who. Smith
stated, demanded JSOO to Bectire the ap
pointment of James King, and for whom
Smith Btrove to extort the money from
the notary, has mad.' but feeble denial of
the charges the ex-assistant secretary of
the Assembly has thrust upon him.
Mr. Dibble is authority for the state
ment that Smith Is still with us. He has
not seen the enterprising insurance agent,
but he has heard from him. Smith gave
Dibble a long-distance jolly over the tele
phone yesterday morning, if the Assem
blyman's assertions are correct. Dibble's
end of the line was In San Francisco, but
the location of Smith during "the effort to
Bmooth matters over with his friend and
benefactor is a profound secret.
The man who got the money out of the
King transaction and who failed to di
vide with the legislator whom he Implicat
ed in his disgraceful traffic left his lodging
place. 3256 Twenty-second street, yester
day morning before sun-up. Ho has not
been seen since, but he has telephoned.
and Mr. Dibble is satisfied. Previous to
his departure, which his landlady says
was decidedly hasty, a note was delivered
to Smith by a messenger. It might have
be< n a letter of condolence or possibly a
missive containing chunks of good advice
from Assemblyman Dibble. It might have
been a few suggestions from the same
Hource as to the proper method of hand
ling greenbacks and of the advisability of
avoiding waste baskets. No one knows
who Is willing to tell, and until Smith
comes out of the seclusion, which must
certainly afford him momentary peace,
the matter will remain a secret.
Smith Is somewhat of a will-o'-the
wisp. His landlady says he frequently
stays away from his lodpings for days at
a time and never tells where he is going
or whfn he will return.
At the office of Manhelm. Pibhern &
Co., 217 Sansonie street, where Smith has
his desk, he sustains his reputation as a
man of mystery. He has not been at the
office for several days and his return la
problematical.
It was thought that Smith might have
souprht seclusion in restful Oakland,
whence be onme to this city, but the man
ner of his leaving the Athens of the Pa
cific a few years apo precludes the possi
bility of his returning.

CROWDS AT THE CIRCUS.
Extra Attractions Are Added to the
Programme.
"Sorry, sir. that we can't accommodate
you, but there are no reserved seats left;
the last peat was sold twenty minutes
ago." Such was the. answer given to a
would-be purchaser at Main's circus last
night.
"That shows that the people of San
Francisco appreciate a good circus," said
I'ri ?s Agent Harrison. "We have prom
ised them a show where every act is a
feature, and we have kept our word, anJ
In return they have shown us that San
Francisco deserves its reputation â that of
being: one of the best show towns in the
country. Mr. Main has lived up to his
promise, and he advertises only what he
shows."
The closing 1 nights of Main's circus find
th.-> tents as crowded as on the opening
night. Interest never wanes from the
beginning of the entertainment until the
last race has been run. General Shafter
was an interested spectator last night
and warmly applauded the Rough Rid
ers. They were certainly deserving of it,
as their act is without doubt the strongest
as well as the most novel performance
of the kind seen here.
A feature that deserves more than pass
ing mention is the band. All the old-time
worn-nut circus music is cut out and it
has been the aim of the leader. Professor
John H. Gill, who, by the way, is the
youngest band leader in America, to play
nothing hut up-to-date music. Professor
Gill gives promise of becoming one of the
foremost band lenders in the country.
This afternoon there will he a matinee
and to-night a farewell performance will
be given. Heretofore it has been the cus
tom to cut the programme on closing
nights, but Mr. Main has inaugurated a
Dew departure In this, that instead of a
!-h<. rt performance several new features
will be added, making the closing night
the strongest of the season.

Chinese Prices Going Up.
The price of "chow" is going up.
"Chow" is the preserved food, ginger and
so on, that the Chinese bring here from
China for delicacies. Tea has risen in
price three and one-half cents a pound in
Chinatown. Chinaware and various otner
articles have taken on an upward
tendency. The whole line of Chinese
wares is expected to be more costly soon.
This is the information that the Chinese
give brokers who do n. custom house busi
ness for them. The reason assigned is. the
increased freight rates and the scarcity
of the goods in Chinatown, brought about
by the withdrawal of steamers from the
regular passenger lines between this port
and Hongkong to fit the demands of the
United States transport service. The
Custom-house brokers are doing a com
paratively small business among the
Chinese, because of the infrequency of
the steamer service.

not one stick of the building or fragment

placed was blown away hundreds of feet.

less to do anything but run. From the
attitude in which the bodies were found
some are of the opinion that they had a
premonition of what might be expected
and were running away when they were
killed.
When the hundreds of aroused employes
rushed to the wreck they found nearly an
acre of ground in flames. The two-story
mixing house and the large acid house
were â â "â â ''. the railroad track was blown
away and everywhere was flame ana
fume. Assistant Superintendent T. S. Cat
lett organized the men into a fire brigade
and soon had the fire subdued sufficiently
to permit of a search for the bodies. The
remains of three were soon found, but
for a long time nothing could be learned
of the fate of Mulholland. Small frag
ments were ultimately found a coupie of
hundred yards away and were Identified
as the remains of Mulholland. The body
of Foreman Morgan was found on the
side of the hill on which the building
stood. Beside him -was the carcass of a
horse that had been killed while brows
ing too near the niter house. The cloth-
Ing was torn from Morgan's body and
through his head was a large splinter,
which of itself could have caused instant
death. Morgan lived in Pinole with his
parents and was about twenty-seven
years of age. He had been employed In
the capacity of foreman of the glycerin
house tor about six months.
William Talbot. the driver of the sup
ply car, was an ex-soldier and was about
twenty-five years old. He had been with
the company nearly a year and was tem
porarily selected as supply driver in the
absence of J. A. Kelley, who only left
last night for a vacation. Talbofs body
was not badly mangled and was found
quite near where the nitroglycerin nouse
had been. :.'â 
W. R. Matthews was not over thirty
years old and was considered an able as
sistant. His aged parents live away off
In Falrland, Mich., and his friends at
once undertook the unhappy task of com
municating the sad news, for in Pinole
the sorrow of one has by usage become
the concern of all."
John Mulholland lived in San Francisco
and was but twenty-eight years old. For
nearly nine years he has been in the em
ploy of the company and was a mixer of
experience. His remains were difficult to
recover and what was found was identl- I
n>d by the clothing and boots.
Charles Dodge is the lucky man of the
fatality. H<- was In the mixing house a
couple of minutes before the exp.osion
and had just entered the cooking house,
which is about two hundred feet away,
when h" was thrown to the ground and
the building he waa in was badly wrecked.
George Appel was at work on the plat
form of the cooling house when the force
of the shock threw' him off and broke his
ankle.
"When I left the mixing house," said
Dodge, "everything was running as usual.
The four men were all working In
harmony and triers was not the slightest
indication that anything might go wrong.
All talk about their quarreling is non
sense. I had barely reached the cooling
house when I saw the flash and knew that
It was all up. So far as I could judge I
should think there would be about tiOOO
pounds of oil in the house when it went
up."
John P.ermingham Jr., superintendent of
the works, knows no reason why an
explosion should have taken place, and
lias been able to discover none.
"All the men were good workmen," he
said, "and worked together in one crew.
Every precaution possible has been taken
by us to guard against accidents and we
are always warning the men about exer
cising proper care. I cannot learn any
thing that will throw light oa this morn-

MRS. RABENECK INSANE.
Her Inordinate Craving for and Over
indulgence in Liquor Made
Her Mad.
Coroner Hill held an Inquest yesterday
upon the body of Mrs. May Rabeneck,
who committed suicide last Friday nlpht
In her room at 403 Stevenson street by
hanging herself with a sheet to the bed
post She had made two gashes in her
throat with her husband's razor before
she hanged herself.
The testimony was to the effect that
Mrs. Rabeneck was demented from ex
cessive indulgence in Intoxicating liquors.
Her husband Is a waiter at the Zinkand
and works until midnight. He testified
yesterday that he had pleaded with her
time ami again to refrain from drink, but
that all his pleadings were In vain.
"I went to the saloons and groceries in
the block." he said, "and asked the pro-
prietors, for the sake of humanity, not to
give my wife any liquor. They promised
that they would not, and when I came
home yesterday morning and found her
drunk I questioned her. and she told me
that she had got the liquor at a place on
Mission street."
The woman had been on a protracted
sprrp for several days up to the time of
her death, and imagined that people were
watching and following her with Intent to
do her harm.
The Jury returned a verdict that the
woman committed suicide while tem
porarily insane from drink.
Mrs. Townsend's Forethought.
When Mrs A. S. Townsend bought
twelve hundred copies of tho Wasp sou
venir and presented them to the returning
volunteers she evidently knew they would

the programme which was prepared at
the secret caucus went through without
a hitch, except for the mild opposition of
Mayor Phelan. who presided. The latter

PAINT A .NEW
PICTURE FOR
A GOOD FRAME
r~w FICTT'RE worthy the frameâ find
/ I the artiPt who can paint it and
f 1 Marie Antoinette shall live again
V, 1 and the old regime shall whirl and
Jl spread and take its flight in a
shriek of hate and horror. Such scenery
and costumes and properties must not be
wasted. They are beautiful, historical, |
irreproachable. I except a certain nine- ,
teenth century bed that intrudes itself \
and will be heard above things that have I
a better claimâ such is the cussedness of
the ill bred.
Why pet the prologue in 1777? Make it ;
instead ITSS, on that memorable night j
when storms were brewing and the "Bar- j
ber of Seville" was played in the theater
of the little Trianon. Let the curtain rise
upon the crowd (I said crowd) coming ,
from the- play, and let Beaumarchais him- .
self, that herald of the revolution, bo â 
there with his loud ways and his desire
for prominence. Let d'Artois enter
dressed ;i s Figaro and Marie Antoinette
as Rosina, and there you have color. Tho
military band might even be playing upon
the terrace. Let there be fops in plenty,
courtiers with their endless courtesy and |
their witty tongues. Enough has been
handed down historically to make rat
tllng good dialogueâ lies perhaps, but
clover lies, and so- who cares? Talk of i
Rohan and Cagliostro and La Motte and
the necklace might be upon the tongueâ
an occasional shadow in a corner, but let |
the keynote of the situation be d'Artois'
famous speech as Figaro:
"Upon my word, sir, since men have no i
choice between stupidity and madness, if
I can't get any profit .1 want at least |
pleasure; so hurrah for happiness!" and .
let him repeat it with a laugh to the giddy
crowd. Let reckless gayety prevail and
let the curtain fall upon a beautiful
minuet. It would not fall in silence and
the first act would be impatiently awaited.
The first act might waver between
brilliancy and doom, popularity and dis
favor with suggestions of crowded ante
chambers and the breathless haste of an
approaching crisis, that a Necker may
avertâ haste where courtiers and minis
ters are given earnest audience and no
twaddle talked.
i Now let act II rise in a mighty cres
j cendo until it reaches the mob and doom, i
(One mob Is Impressive; plurallzed It loses
its effect). Then to the Coneiergerie (why
is it necessary that Louis' last hours be
pictured?), and even here is a chance for {
color, if two scenes be givenâ one whe â¢'
the French nobility huddle and hold
and compose -and sing their- madrigals
and 'are gallant and gay and graceful.
â  Suicidej Fouquler-Tlnvljle. but a merry
'â one. "You may kill us when you p1

â  wiih' Marie Antoinette's' last -hours (no â

FIRE ESCAPES FOR SCHOOLS.
Board of Education Will Equip the
Large Buildings.
The Board of Education ha? decided to
equip all the large school buildings of thig
city with fire escapes. Plans have al
ready been made to put the safety de
vices on the Girls' High School, Mission
High and Clement Grammar schools.
Over half the schools in the department
are over three stories high and are there
fore BUbject to the law in that regard.
Fire escapes }\ive also been ordered by
the Fire Wardens on the Lincoln School
property at Market and Fifth streets, but
the lessees have refused to comply with
the order. They contend that the ciiy
should furnish the tire escapes requin d
by law. as thp property belongs to tho
School Department. Jt will probably be
necessary for the City and County At
torney to settle the contention and a law
suit may be the outcome.

ALAMEDA'S TAX RATE.
Will Be Higher Than for Several
Years Past.
AI.A.MKDA. Sept. ?.o.â lt is stated that
will be a cut made in the salaries
paid police officers In this city. In fact,
retrencbtneni In ;ill the different city de
partments i* being considered.
'Hih police officers at the present time,
with the exception of the City Marshal,
receive a salary of $S0 per month. This
amount it is proposed to cut to $70 per
month, in order to economize.
The City Trustees held a committee
meeting last evening for the purpose of
considering the tax rate to be fixed at their
meeting Monday night. They agreed upon
a rate of $1 16. and while all the items of
the tax levy have not been determined
upon definitely, â¢ that will be the figure
formally established by them.
That rate on an assessed valuation of
$11,050,922, shown by <"ity Assessor Smith's
coll totals, will produce 5125.190 In taxes.
The State. County and city rateâ sl .'A
plus $1 16 â is ?l! sti. The County Assessor's
valuation of Alameda property is $10,669,
--4r>o. Last year's rate of $105, on a valua
tion 0r.'512.:!54.597. produced a total of $]:SO.-
VS.. 96, or nearly $2000 more than the $1 1U
rate this year will produce with the de
cr< used valuation. .
in ' every department, excepting the
School Department, the amounts asked
for by the heads of the departments have
been considerably cut down. The School
Department asked for $18,415, allowed $18,
--400; High School '$10,560, allow, d $10,000;
Free Library asked for $8410, allowed STUJO;

lowed $25,0. r >U.
The bond interest fund will get $24,332.
The general fund apportionment was
placed at $47,000, cut from $51,537 86. Con
siderable more cutting will, have to be
done, as the total of these apportionments
is over $4000 in excess of the amount of
taxes that will be raised at the rate fixed.
With the exception of the year 1895, when
the rate was $120. the rate determined
on last night is the highest in the last
six years. .

THACKERAY ON A TOUR.
The Man of Letters Was No Match
for a Hackman.
Thackeray loved to relate jokes on
himself; and one he especially enjoyed
was about a Reading hackman. The
author was unacquainted with the
} town and the moment he emerged from
the railway station he told a hackney
I coachman to drive him to. the nearest
! hotel. The driver closed tlif door cere
j moniousiy. mounted his b.ox and they
i started. In half a minute : the cab was
' at a standstill, and Thackeray saw the
I cabman at the door, bowinir to him to
come out. He did se without a word
and found that he'was at the portico of
the station hotel, which he had failed
! to see was not a dozen yards off.
' But he handed the man a shilling and
was entering the hotel, rather pleased
with his own sang froid. when he was
amazed to see the cabman taking off
his coat and offering to "fight him for
the -other sixpence." It appeared that
on that day a resolution of the Reading
Town Council had come into operation
empowering hackney coachmen to
charge eighteenpence for- any distance
within the township. This was its first
fruits! It is unnecessary to add that
the cabman got his money and Thack
eray a good story to tell at the clubs.â

Mrs. Parvenuâ lt's very annoying,

spoons I gave them weren't solid. They

Mr. Parvenuâ Of course not. They're

and left those spoons.â Detroit Free

ASSAILED THE
SPEAKER WITH
ROTTEN EGGS
A Lively Meeting on
Grant Avenue.
â â¦ â
CHASE OF THE MISCREANTS
SOCIALIST ADVOCATE GIVEN A
HARD DEAX.
While Expounding His Doctrines He
Is Forced to Retire Under a
Shower of Decayed Hen
Fruit.
The harangue of a Socialist who holds
forth at Market street and Grant avenue
last night almost resulted in a riot. A
large crowd attracted to the scene by
the stentorian voice, while listening to
the address descriptive of the virtues of
socialism was suddenly assailed with de
cayed eggs that came from both sldea of
the street. Several of the sympathizers
of the speaker, incensed at the action of
the egg-throwers, started to wreak venge
ance on them.
One of them was armed with a pistor
and he loudly declared his intention
of shooting 1 the men who dis
turbed the meeting by resorting to throw
ing eggs at the speaker.
Policeman McQuade. who was present
and who had nis uniform almost ruined
by getting in the way of the socialist and
receiving several eggs that were not in
tended for him. promptly arrested
the desperate young man and ordered
the crowd to disperse.
Just then anotner volley of eggs struck
the crowd and the sympathizers of the
speaker determined to be revenged.
Suspecting that the egg-throwers wers
ensconced on the roof of the clothing
store they made a concerted effort to
reach them. The egg-throwers, evidently
becoming alarmed, abandoned their posi
tions, leaving enough eggs behind them
to supply a cheap restaurant where they
sell for the same price as doughnuts.
While they were gathering up the spoil*
of victory a young man with a decidedly
tough cast of countenance started to as
sault the speaker. He was Instantly sur
rounded by a number of the socialist's
friends, who proceeded to annihilate him.
Police Officer McQuade promptly rushed
to his rescue and aftfr considerable diffi
culty finally saved him from being rough
ly handled, to say the least.
While McQuade was engaged in protect
ing the young man from being assaulted
"Colonel Brady approached the speak
er's stand and becoming abusive he was
ordered to move on. He refused to do so
and was placed under arrest. Before the
arresting officer had a chance to ring in
for the patrol wagon Detective Whittaker
took Brady in charge and led him away
from the scene. He was afterward al
lowed to go to his home.
Finally She Let the Subject Drop.
A most embarrassing experience was
that of a certain West Philadelphia
young woman who. a few evenings ago,
j attended a reception in which a number
I of well-known club women participated.
| It so happened that among these were
; several who had found the matrimonial
! yoke an unwelcome one for various
. reasons and had obtained legal separa
tions from their husbands. To one of
these ladies, quite unwittingly, having
just been introduced, the young woman,
who js nothing if not conversational
; and vivacious, addressed the question:
; "By the way, Mrs. R , don't you
; think divorce is wrong?" The lady,
i reddening slightly, replied: "My dear,
there are two sides to that question.
| Perhaps you have not hoard my story."
The questioner, embarrassed beyond
! measure, stammered an excuse and
! walked away. To the first woman she
j met she confided her trouble, saying:
j "Oh, dear! I have just made a most
' unfortunate remark. You know Mrs.
I R ? Well, I spoke to her about di
i vorce, and she's divorced, you know."
j "So am I. my dear." was the smiling
! reply, and once again the young woman
| wished the floor would open under her.
She felt so bad that she went to one
i of the ladies in charge of the reception
! and, taking her aside, told her the
whole story, asking her advice as to
â  what she should do. "Do nothing at
| all. Miss I ," was the reply. "I really
i don't think they have any horror of
! the subject, so long as it's innocently
j called up. I know T haven't, and I. too,
jam a divorcee." Whereat the convÂ«r
--! rational miss donned her hat, and,
j fearing to say another word, went
home.â Philadelphia Record.

ROBERT MORROW
ASSAULTED BY A
BOLD PEDDLER
Had Thrown Him Off
a Streetcar.
YOUNG MAN RESENTED THE ACT
FOLLOWED THE MAGNATE AND
STRUCK HIM.
The Slogger Captured, but Was Re
leased Before Mr. Morrow Could
Surrender Him to the
Police.
Robert F. Morrow, president of the Sut
t* r Street Railway, was punched once
yesterday at the foot of Market street Just
aa he v..--< going to take a boat to cross
the bay. I 'is assailant was a young fel
low, not much more than a boy, who man
to get away without receiving any
I in return, and who, fearing
that a policeman might be coming, sped
i a corner and was lost to sight in
an instant Mr. Morrow did not know his
assailant, and made no attempt to have
a chase made to secure tho fugitive. The
whole affair occurred and was over in an
at, and the capitalist seemed to be
irprised that he did not act very
prompi y
Mr. Morrow went to the ferry on a Sut- j
ter street car that reached the ferry at
about 1 o'clock. Just before the ferry was |
reached a young man jumped on the car j
and attempted to sell a racing programme j
to the passengers. Mr. Morrow saw this i
and ordered the peddler off. As his order
was not promptly obeyed, and tho re- 1
sponse to his order was anything but i
complimentary, he put up one knee and.
pushed the objectionable passenger from I
the platform. Considerable force was ex
ercised, and tho surprised young fellow
was angry. : ;
On â¢ the â  platform. in : front of the ferry
station, at the point: where the Butter
street line terminates,: were several young]
men of about th( same age, all of whom i
were engaged In trying to. sell the same I
programme on the cars and around the j
ferry station. Hardly was the. bounced i
passenger on the ground when the others
surrounded him and told him that' he had j
: : oiipht to hit Mr. Morrow, who did not
Fc-em to be known to any of them.' ' . .
' The! next that l the capitalist knew .was
that he had | been: on his head by a;
bony but poorly steered fist. Mr. Mbr- j
row had something to do with diverting |
the- blow, which had been aimed at his!
right eye. His overcoat was over his left
arm; His right arm was free to use, and, '
' although he was surprised, he managed to
ward oft the blow to some extent and also
to destroy its 'force. Consequently the ;
; fist rattled upon his stiff derby hat and
did not leave its mark on his face. : 'â ' :
A* the. same time tho other .peddlers!
were close to him.- and were somewhat
â 'threatening, but they .saw that: the assail-;
-6ht was in -no mood to keep, on, and they
offered no fight, :in ; fact. Mr. Morrow's \
enerrty, as soon as.. he. had hit once, was i
;in the hands:'. of the. '.conductor and driver
: â of Sutter street" cur No. 31.' He was not
I held very tightly. ..As Mr. Morrow made
Ino move" to call' -a policeman the car men
. let go and 'the' pedfJl^r, suddenly, learning \
â lor the- lir&t time-,- from a -bystander, who
file was that he. hart punched, disappeared

MINIATURE HAY BARN
FOR PARIS EXPOSITION
A San Francisco Firm
Will Compete For a
World Prize.
UNIQUE EXHIBIT BY SCOTT & MAGNER.
ONE of the interesting exhibits at the Paris Kxposition will be the minia
ture hay barn which Scott & Magner are now preparing. It will be an
exact fac simile of their offices and warehouses at 6ir> Sixth street. The
barn will consist of a redwood framework about five feet high, three
feet wide and six feet long, ami the side walls of the structure will be
built of tiny hay bales, each about one cubic fool in area. These will be piled
up in tier.s comprising the different kinds of hay produced in California, namely
alfalfa, clover, wheat and the natural California oat hay. Kach kind will be
appropriately labeled, showing its specific quality. The sides of thr- barn will
be draped and festooned with red, white and blue silk ribbons surmounted with
French and American flags.
The biirn will be inclosed in a glass case ten feet long and six feft wide
and will be surrounded by samples of California cereals and mill feed of all
descriptions. There will be 1200 of the miniature bales of hay on exhibition,
and these have all been pressed into shape by means of the model of a newly
invented hay press. Steel wires are used in the packing of the bales. In dis
cussing the intention of the firm to make this exhibit A. "SV. Scott Jr., one of
is members, said:
"The Paris Commission is anxious to make a display of the grain products
of this State and we have decided to take the matter in hand. "We realize that
it is rather difficult to make a creditable showing with an article as dull and
prosaic as hay, but we believe that we have evolved something striking that
will undoubtedly interest the beholder. California is unique in its hay pro
duction. Inasmuch as here the wheat is cut brfore maturity in the making of
hay, while in the East and in Europe the wheat is first thrashed and the
residue forms hay. We consider that our hay is superior in nutritive qualities
to the other, and for that reason v.-ill engage the attention of agriculturists.
Of course we will enter into competition with similar Kuropean products and
confidently expect to win out."
IN MY LADY'S BOWER.
Shades of Green and Violet for Deco
rating a Pretty Room.
Nowhere In the house can the ex
pression of a woman's taste be su com
plete as in the furnishings of her own
room. Here she may focus unhamper
; ed ht-r ideas, practical and artistic, and
! impart a personal charm to every de
tail.
The rapid growth In late years of
i general art knowledge has made its
! inevitable impression upon interior
decoration. The results of home ef
forts in furnishing are at a higher level
I than they were ten years ago, and the
careless collecting of commonplace
articles has given way to more satis
' factory selections.
Refurnishing their chambers has for
most women an interest that is want
. ing when they have to start out to
â¢ â <;uip new apartments; there is some
thing to begin on, and the limitations
1 are almost a guarantee of success.
Harmony of color is the first most
important element for the amateur dec
orator to have in mind. The large
pieces of furniture, wall hangings and
draperies must be planned with due
reference to this fact, and experiments
made by day and artificial light to test
the combination of color.
A charming room, suggestive of out
door life and pleasant memories, can
be devised by using violet and green
for the colors, and the flowers and
leaves of the violet in the decora
tions. This scheme may be utilized
to advantage in doing over a
j chamber in which either violet or green
: lias been adopted. A plain carpet of
Wilton velvet, ingrain filling, or fab
! i ikona ran be used to cover the entire
floor, with a large rug over the center,
or smaller ones distributed before the
washstand. bureau and doorway.
The walls may be covered with an in
grain paper or a lighter shade of green
or a paper with a white ground and a
design of violets would be pretty.
The latter would be the better choice
if the woodwork is painted white; but
with oak. curly birch, maple, or pine,
the former would look prettier. A few
pieces Of furniture, with forest green
< stain applied, would add the dark green
i of the violet leaf to the delicate color
] ing.
Cretonne for a bedspread and ruffled
I pillow slips can be bought with good
: designs, and gilkoiine to match, to hang
lat the windows, may be found with
some searching.
If the silkoline, however, is not avail
able, Swiss muslin could be substituted
with a white design that could easily
be embroidered over with violet silks.
i A three-paneled screen, to draw around
' the washstand, and a window-box seat
i may also be covered with the cretonne.
Dainty articles for the dressing bu
reau may be embroidered, using the
! violet and its leaf in conventional or
â  natural patterns, and the china pieces
i â comb and brush tray, hair receiver,
powder box, etc. â receive the same
; treatment with mineral paints.
A willow hrunge muy be cushioned
v>ith dark green velour, corduroy, linen
or denim, and a heap of down pillows
| may be made to show the varying
! shades in which the violet grows. A
footstool, to be used as a slipper chair,
should not be forgotten in completing
i the arrangements for feminine comfort,
i and one of willow or in the Moorish
: pattern could be the selection.
These ai> only some of the possibili
ties for making a charming bedroom by
employing the violet's colors.
NERVELESS DRINKERS.
Bartender's Morning Job of Patching
Up Old Soaks.
"T take a drink when I feel like it."
said a Canal-street business man, "and
can't nee that it has ever done me any
harm, but I witnessed a little episode this
morning that has haunted me ever since,
and has forced me to do a whole lot of
thinking. 1 had stepped into a bar very
early to get a cocktail, and while it was
being compounded a middle-aged gentle
man came and asked one oÂ£ the attend
' ants 10 pour him out a little plain
j whisky. He was carefully dressed and
had all the marks of retinement and good
breeding, and his request was so un
usual that 1 turned involuntarily to look
| at him. Tho bartender exhibited no sur
l prise, and placed half a small glassful of
! whisky at his elbow, but the instant he
stretched out his hand T saw that the
I man was on the verge of nervous col
lapse. He shook like an aspen, and when
he finally managed to seize the tumbler
Its contents flew in every direction. 'Lot
me assist you. colonel,' said the bartender
! quietly, and, pouring out another drink,
he leaned over and held it to his lips.
The man said nothing, but gave him a
haggard look that went into my heart
like a knife. My God! what a look!
Shame, humiliation, and abject animal
terror. 7t started the sweat on me like
water. Well, he drank his whisky, stood
still for a minute as If gathering "himself
together, and sauntered out as cool as
ever.
"T asked the bartender if he had many
such customers, and he laughed. "T.ots of
'cm,' he said. 'There isn't a first-class bar
In town.' he wont on, 'that don't patch j
up a few old boya lik<> that almost every
morning. They're not drunkards, but
they've been at it so many years thai
their nerves arc gone, and, although thej
don't know it. they arc working on ab
solutely nothing but whisky. As soon as
they Ret a little fresh fuel in the morn
ing they're all rlKht. but they tome in
scared and out of their wits, thinking
they're going to drop dead every minute.
I'll net that gentleman you .saw ran sign
his name now without a quiver.' [ walked
out reflecting. It was a weird sight, !
gentlemen, and 1 don't want to witness it
;iK;iin. Suppose we go and have some
thing?"âX<jW Orleans Times-Democrat.
SMART GIRLS.
Prove to Be Expert Safe Crackers and
Escape F om Prison.
Two prisoners, mere girls, escaped from i
the State Reformatory for Women early J
Tuesday morning and w.>n honorary mem
bership in the proudest society of cracks
men. For those twoâ Margaret Marlbor- j
ough, 20 years old, and Martha Brinck
man, 21 years oldâ not only earned liberty,
however brief, hut broke open a safe arid
stole $150 and carried off $:.imj worth of the
Superintendent's fine clothes. Arrayed in;
these clothes there is nothing about the j
appearance of the pair to awake sus
picion.
Margaret and Martha were committed to
the reformatory from New York thre<
years ago for misdemeanor. Being tidy
and seemingly trustworthy, they had been
employed as maids in the apartments of
Mrs. Abbot, the Superintendent, and Mrs.
Roy, the head Supervisor. At night the
girls, like the other prison< rs, were locked
In their colls, which are small rooms with
wooden doors and big, strong locks.
Margaret and Martha must have care
fully studied the conduct of affairs in the
institution. When the three night watch
men were elsewhere in the building Mar
garet broke open the door of her cell with
a small steel bar she bad somehow pro
cured. Thru, from the outside, she broke
Martha's lock next door. Tiptoeing along
the dark corridors they went to the office
and opened a small private safe, from
which they took $150. Perhaps they kn.'w
the combinationâ there were but few
scratches on the safe door.
They shrewdly knew their prison dress j
would at once betray them. So they pro
ceeded to the Superintendent's and Super
visor's rooms, with which they were per
fectly familiar, and. carefully avoiding the
rooms whore the women slept, they ran
sacked the bureaus and wardrobes. They
took off their prison uniforms and dressed
themselves in fashionable clothes and
bundled up other clothes and jewelry
Then they pried a lock and made their
way to the ground floor; pried another
! lock and were in the yard. The tall
prison wall confronted them. How they
climbed it they only know. It looks in
surmountable to a monkey.
About 1:15 a. m. the ticket agent sold
two tickets to New York City to two
smiling and polite young women! who in a
| few minutes took a train. The "-iris"
escape was not discovered for- four hour<=
Thru the police of the neighboring cities
were notified, and earnest but fruitless
search was made.â New York World. â â â 
Did tho postman leave any letters
Mary? the mistress asked, on 'returnine
from a visit one afternoon.
"Nothing but a postcard, ma'am"
"Who is it from. Mary? 1 '
"And do you think I'd read it. ma'am"'
asked thp girl, with an Injured air
"Perhaps not. But any one who sends
mr a message on a postcard is either
stupid or impertinent."
"You'll excuse me, ma'am." returned
the girl, loftily, "hut that's a nice waun
be talking about your own mother'"

Barley and Oats.
The circular of George Morrow & Co. says:
"Barleyâ Receipts for the week. 158,404 cen
tals. The local situation Is' considerably ' bet
ter than it was nt the close, of . last week.
Shippers can sell Barley for foreign account.
but they want ships more than they do Bar-.
ley; of which they have an abundant supply;
In the sample market local mills are light buy
ers, but there has been.-- a very good demand
for No. 1 Feed Barley which would pass m
spection to pile up against December contracts
i-oH on call. This later demand has. resulted
in a good healthy advance in. the price if me
dium-weight bright Barley*. Brewers are very
qutet and seemingly have all- the Barley they
require at present. For Chevalier there â¢â  Is
practically rui demand at present. ' :
t'Oats^-Recelpts for the week. 22.735 centals.
V.V have again to record., the fuel that Cali
fornia is still supplying herself with Oats.
Ofegotl has sent a stray shipment or two. but
the markrt is still awaiting the expected in
flux of r.ff-color Oregon Oats. There has been
some activity in the market this week for the
better prade of the Oats now offering, but hold
ers cf all descriptions have been quite willing
to meet buyers half way in the question of
price. If the Barley market can be inanlpu-.
lated ana held up in price, It goes without
saying that Oats will advance in close touch
with the former." .â  . â¢ '

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, fept. Another slight rise In
wheat at . Liverpool, notwithstanding yester
d;i>? v*..rline In this market, caused wheat to
open firm and at a fractional advance. Be
pii. s the strength at Liverpool, the market
Â«3ui]JitlpÂ«d b >' tne continued light receipts at
primary points: ; ; The impression apparently
prevailed that receipts will continue to run
much lighter. l thai a -'year ago. and though
there was a moderate amount of realizing at
the opening advance, only a slight rea-Jti)n
resulted and prices quickly recovered. The
market was in the main a scalping one, and
the bear element, timid at the recent strength
of thr market under rather adverse conditions,
was Inclined to oover â ..: short contracts over
Sunday fearing war developments in the
Transvaal. Traders who sold yesterday were
prominent In the buying. The strength, how
ever, was confined to .the deferred futures.
September shorts having apparently been well
filler) \ip and â¢â ,.-- by long In
terests resulted in a sharp break in the price
of that option. It sold at one time at Hie
discount under December. Winter wheat
points reported an excellent milling demand.
Tovard the close there was Increased selling
on prospects of a large increase In the visi
ble, and the slight advance which had pre
vailed soon disiiTineared. â¢ The close was rather
heavy. December opened H@Hc higher at
''\r. It sold at TS^sc, then advanced to 73 7 jc
and declined to 73'jc, where It closed. Sep
tember declined from 72U972%C a t the open
ing to 72'i>c. and closed %@lc lower at 71 s ic.
The feature of a dull session in corn waa th*
â wt-aknesu of the September option, which' de
clined ',;c under liquidation by prominent
operators. The demand was light, shorts hav
ing apparently covered thoroughly and prices
were easily affected. A heavy Increase in local
contracts Is looked for and this affected specu
lation. Deferred futures were- rather steady
early with wheat, but later . followed Septem
ber downward, the market closing heavy. The
snipping demand was faW considering the
New i'ork holiday. DecemSer corn cloned \%c
lower at 29%e. September closed -at n%c.
Oats were <iuiet and firm. Shorts were bid
ders for September and advanced the pi Ice of
that option about a pent at onetime, but the
improvement did not hold. â¢ Deferred futures
kept within a narrow range. The market
Fhowed a. drooping tendency late in the day,
offerings being freer at the advance. Decem
ber closed unchanged at 22% c. September
closed Vie higher at 22*Â£ c.
Trading in provisions was mainly In the way
â¢I changing. The opening waa slightly lower
In sympathy with a rather weak hog market !
and kept at a slight discount most of the ses
sion. Packers were ttie chief sellers. The de
mand was not bo good. January pork closed
unchanged at $9 75: January lard a shade low

Of Hay have been filling up their lofts rapid- ;

The steam whaler Mary D. Hume ar
rived from the Arctic yesterday: Last
Kcason she sent down the product of ten
whales and this year she has taken six
tun more, so all hands and the cook will
have a good "lay" coming to them. While
the vessel was in winter quarters at St.
Michael, Thurne, the carpenter, died and
was buried on Herschel Island. The
Hume came into port very much the
wor.se for wear and leaking. She was
caught in a terrific gale 'on September 19.
Part of the forefoot was carried away,
two of the boats were smashed, the bul- j
warks were stove in and, all told, the .
crew put in a very bad night of it.
The captain of the Hume reports the
catch of the fleet as follows:
rasher, two whales; Beluga, sixty
three whales; Bowhead; i wo whales; Mary
D. Hume, nineteen! whales. ;
The United States steamer Thetis ar
rived from- the frozen north yesterday.
She also was caught In a heavy gale. It
was on September 111. and the crew had
a lively time of it while it lasted. Oil
was used to . great advantage, it pre
vented the waves from breaking aboard,
and as soon as. it; began to spread the
Thetis rode like a duck on tne water;
making splendid weather of it. The The
tis jeft here on May 27 last, and during
her absence visiied Cape Prince or' Wales;
Port Clarence, Point :. Iney, Anvil City,
Golovin Bay, : aska, St. Michael, tit.
Lawrence Island and Dutch Harbor. Dur
ing her cruising she carried -<"' reindeer
from Siberia to Cape Prince of Wales,
while the chartered steamer Albion, car
ried as many more. â ]"),.' Thetis brought
down Dr. J. S. Stone, Dr. E. W. Bidwell
nnd Paul Mitchell from Anvil City. The
two doctors spent sixteen months on the
Kowak River, but-finding no trace of gold
made their way to Nome, where they did
well. Mr. Mitchell is the Government
schoolmaster at St. George- Island.
On September 11, while the Thetis was
at L'nalaska, a terrific storm rag< l. The
vessel was moored to the wharf and sev
era! times she. came very near going
adrift. Some of the standing rigging had
to be unrove and used as mooring lines
In order to keep the vessel from going
adrift. Captain Buhner reports that there
were no poachers in Bering Sea this wa
ton. The Thetis will probably >." to Mare
Island, where she will be put out of com
mission. It is not likely that she will-go
out again on another cruise.
The ciliary cruiser Badger was in
the fairway yesterday and had to be
moved in order to allow the trans
Kheridan to get away from Folsom-street
wharf. The Badger will : â  lain in the
stream a week and will then go out of
commission at the navy-yard. Captain
Miller has formed a very high opinion of
the Naval Militia on this coast. Before
coming here he had the Eastern men out
on cruises, and he is thus able to compare
the various battalions, and the California
boys, to say the least of it. do not suffer
by the comparison. Captain Miller has
made a number of suggestions to the na
val authorities, which If carried out will
greatly improve the militia on this, coast,
lie Inks.
The Pa-clfic Mail Company's steamer
Fan Bias arrived from Panama and way
ports yesterday. She brought up eight
cabin anil ten steerage passengers, besides
live Chinese in transit. The officers of
the San Bias report that yellow jack is
prevalent a; Panama and several vessels
cannot got away because of the number
of deaths among the crews.
The British steamer Benmohr is on her
way here from Hingu. Japan, under char
ter to the United States Government. She
will be put in the transport service as
Foon as she arrives. She is l!'-".:; tons net
burden, 340 feet long. 41 feet 8 inches
broad and 24 feet deep.
The steamers chartered by the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company axe the On Sang
and Algoii. The former is a small vessel
of 2802 tons gross burden, but the Algoa
will probably be the largest steamer that
lias ever come here. She is 7."75 tons gross
burden and will carry 11,000 tons dead
weight. She is 455 feet long, 58 feet broad
and 2:' feet 4 inches deep. These vessels
will carry freight for the Hail Company
â while the City of Peking, Rio de Janeiro
mid City of Para are under charter to
the Government.
(.Jus Anderson, a stevedore, had his leg
crushed In a terrible manner on the
steamer Queen yesterday. At the Harbor
Hospital it was found necessary to am
putate the leg above the knee. Anderson
was at work near the f-levator and hi?
right leg was hanging down the hatch
way. By Borne means the elevator was
started and before the unfortunate fellow
could do anything his leg was crushed
between the deck and the elevator.
George Martin, was treated at the Har
bor Hospital by Dr. Thompson yesterday
afternoon for a gunshot wound in the
right hand. He was crossing the bay on
the ferry steamer Berkeley and went to
examine his pistol. The weapon went off
nnd blew a hole in his hand. Martin was
drunk and was on his way to the hoo
Jields. .
The boiler-makers employed on the Lee
lanaw quit work yesterday because they
were not given an eight-hour day : The
"Union Iron Works got non-union men to
fill their places. It will take a month to
repair the transport.

JACKRABBITS WILL
BE HUNTED FOR FUR
SAN FRANCISCO MAN SEES A
CHANCE FOR GAIN.
Hermann Waldeck Believes That Cal
ifornia Has Raw Material for
the Making of Millions
of Hats.
Hermann Waldeck, dealer in hides at
34 and 36 Clay street, has decided to in
augurate a new commercial enterprise, to
wit: the utilization of the skins of Cali
fornia jackrabbits. if, on investigation,
the conditions prove to be favorable. Mr.
Waldeck read In The Call some days ago
that a St. JÂ»uis fur dealer had written
to find out whether he could get all the
rabbit skins in this State that he might
want. The St. Louis man thought, from
the accounts he had read of the huge rab
bit drives in California, that the supply
of rabbits here must be unlimited and that
he could get them for a very small
price, because he knew thnt the
California farmers killed the rabbits
to get rid of them and made no use of
them, with the exception of an inconse
quential number marketed in this and
other cities as game. Mr. Waldeck has
Imported many millions of rabbit
skins from Australia during the past
six or seven years, into San Francisco.
The market for the Australian rabbit had
become firmly established in the Tnlted
States prior to the war in the Philippines.
Since the war the price of the Imported
skins has been raised. This increase in

cost, so Mr. Waldeck said yesterday, had
Ã¼btedly caused the St. Louis man to
look about fur cheaper rabbit skins in
California.
Mr. Waldeck believes that there is the
possibility in sight of making quite an in
dustry of growing rabbits for the sake
of their skins. In this State. He sees dif
ficulties In the way of utilizing the rab
bits killed in the drives. Many of the
skins are torn by dogs. The others are
more or less mutilated by the clubs used

market value because the fur is available
for the manufacture of hats. The mil
lions of skins that he has Imported have
all been sold to Eastern hat manufactur
ers. To have the fur valuable It must
be in grood condition. The rabbits must
be killed by some method less violent than
clubbing, possibly by shooting. The coat

counterbalanced by getting a much
greater percentage in good condition.

RAILROAD MEN RETURN.
New Train Schedule for the Southern
Pacific Will Soon Be Operative.
The heads of the different departments
of the Southern Pacific Company, who
have been congregated at Salt Lake City
for pome time past figuring on a new run

day afternoon. J. C. Stubbs. Fillmore,
Goodman and the "Discriminator" are
figain at their desks, but "Glad Hand"
McCormick, the rising youne political
boss, who started with them, was recalled
at Ogden and returned to the "City of
the Saints" to finish some important busi

The new schedule will be given out to
morrow. It provides for one extra train
each way, as has been already stated in
The Cali. It is probable that several
minor changes will have to be made be
fore the new train, which will be known
as the Overland Limited, begins running.

Runaway in the Park.
A horse attached to a light buggy, in
which were seated two ladies. Mrs. John
son and Miss Jones of 513 Golden Gate
avenue, became frightened at something
and ran away in Golden Gate Park yes
day afternoon. Mrs. Johnson, who was
driving, was thrown out. but retained
her grasp on the lines and was dragged
for some distance. Miss Jones climbed
over the seat and jumped out behind.
Officer Kavanaugh captured the runaway

were. his patient burros ' hungrily
browsing on the sparse mountain

frightening ay.-ay the prowling ghouls
against which he had waped Incessant
coni'ict throui^.h torturinp days and
flights, and had then given up the une
qual struggle and his life together.
Forty-seven years ago Keavls was a
propp^roua young lawyer in the city of
Boston. Of excellent family, prepos
sessing in ' appearance and manner,
finely educated, â  eloquent and already
in the enjoyment of a comfortable for
tune, it seemed at that time as if there
â¢were no position, professional, political
and Bociai, to which he might not at
tain. His marriage was a fashionable
event; his bride one of the loveliest of
the city's fair daughters; his- home a
veritable earthly aradise, Into which
alas! a serpent found his way.
Made certain by indisputable proofs
etf his . wife's dishon^- young Reavis
turned his back upon civilization for
ever, and, coming West, dwelt for
nearly three years alone in the wilder
ness by the North Fork of the Feather
River, near thÂ» base of Mount Shasta.
Ever increasing incursions of miners,
however, made that part of the coun
try distasteful to him. as he found it
Impossible to seclude him&elf from the
unwelcome visits of wandering pros
pectors, who rudely broke Into his sol
itude and distracted his mind by in
sistent talk and questioning about the I
earth's golden treasure, which had for
him no Interest or value.
His fellow being? he disliked and
mistrusted; civilization he hated;' and
he determined to find, If possible, an
abiding place where he" could be wholly
removed from the presence and the in- '
fluerice of both. The haven of rest fur 1
which he longed he discovered at last
in the Final range, In what Is now
known as Gila County, Ariz. It was a
small and sheltered glade, embracing
about twenty acres of level land, with
a clear stream of water flowing
through It. IVrpendicular cliffs him-'
dreds of feet high inclosed It on the
north, east and south and, converging
toward the west, left only a pass Into '
the valley of about twenty feet in
width. Beyond this pass old Supersti
tion Mountain, rising over 6000 feet
Into the heavens, stood sentinel over
the wilderness of lesser peaks, shut
ting out the rays of .the setting sun
and early in the afternoon throwing Its
dense shadow over ridge and vale and
canyon. The place, to all appearance
as isolated as a rock in midocean, ap
pealed particularly to Reavis' morbid
nature. Here at least he would be
secure from the Intrusion of wealth
seeking miners and the impertinent
curiosity of idle sight-seers. Pew there
were who would ever climb that rug
ged trail, since there were others far
easier and more accessible at a little
distance, and therefore would ever
think of venturing into the gloomy cul
de sac which he had selected for his
home.
He tollfully collected the pieces of
broken bowlders which lay scattered
over his small territory, and built for
himself a cavellke cabin on the banks
of the little stream near the center of
his natural stockade, and prepared to
pass the remainder of his days In the
Eolltude which he had so learned to
love.
But those were the days, however,
when the cruel and treacherous
Apaches were the roving rulers <<f the
mountains and plains .'^rid valleys of
Arizona and dealt death and devasta
tion .wherever a -white man had the
hardihood to dispute their sway. It
was not long before they learned of the
hermit's advent into their wild do
main, and as soon as they <Hd bo th*>y
determined to Immolate him upon the
altar of their savage hatred for hla
usurping race.
Being as cowardly as they are mur
derous, a band of a dozen painted war
riors stole up the precipitous trail one
night, and Just as the morning sun was
rising above- the Plnal range sounded
their hideous war whoop in the si
lence-deafened ears of the man who
had heretofore reigned supreme In hla
mountain retreat. Fortunately, the
dog that had accompanied him Into ex
ile â a progenitor of the one that,
faithful unto death, defended his dead
master In these later days â awoke
Reavis from his slumbers before his
savage foes could carry out their In
tention of surrounding and making
him prisoner.
When their blood-chilling , challenge
rang out upon the midnight air, thÂ«
beleaguered white man, entrenched be
hind the well nigh impregnable stone
walls of the place which was at once
hl3 habitation and his fortress, was
waiting in the darkness, alert and
ready for the fierce onslaught. During
the brief but bloody engagement that
followed Reavis' trusty rifle did deadly
work, and the discomfited warriors
were nt last forced to retire, carrying
with tlvm the bodies of four of their
comrades. During the ensuing year the
lone white man was attacked by the
Apaches no less than thirteen times,
and after each unequal battle he had
the grim satisfaction of cutting from
four to seven mortuary notches on his
tally â¢ stick. This, however, grew
monotonous. Reavis had settled In
these mountains for the sake of peace
and quiet and solitude, and these oon-
Btant Interruptions were distasteful,
besides being: expensive In the matter
of ammunition.
After much cogitation he evolved a
plan which ho thought, and rightly,
too, as It proved, would forever rid him
of these unpleasing distractions from
his well-settled plan of existence. The
Idea he hit upon was a novel one.
In his happy and hopeful early years
he had occupied his hours of recreat
tlon by Btudying into the mysteries
and possibilities of the electric â¢ fluid,
and had conducted in his own labora
tory a series of somewhat extensive
experiments, which gave him a clear
idea as tv the practical application of.
this irrestlble yet mysterious force.
After fully deciding upon his method
of procedure, the hermit made jour
ney t<> Tucson, a hundred miles dis
tant, I" procure th>- arficlep necessary
for the carrying out of his plan. lie
had brought with him into the wilder
ness, among his other possessions, the
battery which had so amused and in
terested him In* other days.- therefore
h^ needed only wire and powder to put
his designs into execution. These ar
ticles, after a long and dangerous trip,
during which he was obliged to travel
nights and secrete himself and his
burros during the daytime, he secured
and brought back to his cabin, and at
once upon his' arrival home' bepan his
work of preparation for the wholesale
tragedy he had planned.
With infinite toll he dug a pit eight
feet deep and four feet wide, straight
across the narrow pasa which gave en
trance to his home. Four kegs of
powder containing fifty pounds each
were then placed at equal distances
apart in the bottom of this pit, a hole
having first been made in the top of
each and wires fitted therein and care
fully secured. These kegs Reavis cov
ered with* a layer "of earth tightly
packed around them, and then filled
tha long hole solidly with more earth
and a quantity of broken rock. Dry
leaves and small stones and stii;k3
were .scattered over the surface to con
ceal evidences of a disturbance of the
ground, and then conne.ct.ing wires, in-..
Bulated by " broken" bottles, were
stretched along the line of mountain
ash trees that -bordered the stream "to
the battery concealed In the hermit's
cabin.
Everything was. now compete, and
Reavis was caper for the advent of
his untiring enemy. He had not long to
wait, for on the third night after he
had finished his preparations for their
reception, as the moon was slowly
sinking behind _o.kl Superstition, his
dog's low growl awoke him from his
light slumber.
Silencing his trusty friend by a lnw
volced word and a reassuring touch of
his hand. Reavis peered out into the
night and saw a dark figure steal from
the shadow of the bluff outside his in
closure into the shadow of a clump of
treeÃ just beyond his pit. Another and
another followed until twenty-six were
gathered there together, and as the
Bilent watcher, scarcely drawing
breath, kept his eyes fastened upon
them, they moved toward his cabin
In a boc'y, carefully keeping concealed
under the shadow of the foliage above
them. Just where the pit stretched its
hidden length from side to side of the
narrow -way, .the. line of trees-led boom
distance to the right of the cabin In
stead of directly toward It; and here,
as-Reavis had cunningly anticipated,
the warriors paused for consultation.
An Instant and a strange, low
rumbllne smote on their horrified ears;
the dark and silent cabin burst Into a
blinding glow of brilliant Illumination,
In the midst, of which their Intended
victim's figure. black against the daz
zling brightness, stood out in bold re
lief.
At the same moment, and before they
could even turn to flee from the terrors
that encompassed them, the very earth
beneath their feet trembled and rocked
and rose up into spac.e. It was. an in
fernal volcanic eruption of which they

Reavls, gun and knife in hand, ap
proached the scene of death,, one In

self, from .the confusion of horror
which surrounded him. and darted
out of the pass and around the point
of the bluff to carry to his brethren the
dreadful tale which won for Reavis

of his Apache foes. â¢ . ' *

These menus are then printed by the
ship's printer and distributed to the
chefs of thf various divisions. They es
timate it"- amount of various food ma
terials that tiny will require and sub
mit these estimates to the steward for
his approval.
The next step is to make requisition
on the storekeepers for the various
moats, vegetables and other articles
th< Bea appetites
s. The â¢ xtent of this an
; â¢ tlte may be i 1 from the fact
lhal the Oceanic ships for each trip
â¢ ten tons ..f beef, three tons of
such other meats as mutton and veal.
two tons of chickens and nearly two
lons of ducks, turkeys and such gamo
birds as may be In season.
These are merely the fresh meats
which are stored in â  ne big refrigerat
ing room down in the depths of the
ship. The vessel carries also two ions
of smoked and dried meats, 2000 do7.cn
rB. with fish, green vegetables and
fruits in proportion, of groceries and
such commodities as will keep Indefi
nitely, the provision stores are kept
filled.
In another cold storage room the ship
carries 5000 pounds of hutter, 2<">oo doien
eggs and 300 quarts of milk and cream.
Another item not to be overlooks! is
3000 quarts of Ice cream.
These figures give a. ready basis for
computing the amounts of these .vari
ous commodities used each day on
shipboard. In addition, it may be said
That fifty pounds of coffee and over
thirty pounds of tea arc required dally.
Naturally a vast number of dishes are
required. There are 1500 silver spnons.
f orks and knives, an each vari
ety of plates, cups and saucers neces
sary to meet all requirement p.
To wa?h all these dishes is no light
task. For the most part it. is done by
machinery. Big baskets of soiled
dishes are lowered Into tanks of boiling
water which cleanses them thoroughly.
Then they are dried by hand. Tho
silver and finer china is washed by
hand, and this work keeps a force of
ty men busy.
Of table and other llrren the Oceanic
requires enough to stock a shop to last
out a voyage. Ther^ are 1000 table
cloths. 15.000 napkins and the some
number of towels. Unlike most of its
(hold operations the ship's -laun
dry work is done on sh">-,. at the end
of each trip in a plant maintained by
the company for that purpose.
The cooks are am-ong the best paid
of the ship's laborers. Chief cooks re

THE sytem of art training Introduced
Into the San Francisco schools
some two years ago ha.= passed
through the elementary. Introduc
tory, somewhat uninteresting, stage, and
reached a point where production brings
an Immense satisfaction to both mistress
and pupil. The children are led to stud>
nature and life and some really creditable
results are obtained with flowers, foliage,
landscapes and even the more difficult fig
ure. Values are carefully looked to and
the weakness of too much detail avoided.
The work Is certainly educational, but it
has also Its humorous and pathetic side.

A class la Pacific Heights School having
done some particularly satisfactory leaf

to try Its talent more ambitiously. Tho

â¢workers and In twenty minutes became
a population. She is a dainty, fluffy,
beruffled, perfectly symmetrical little
maiden with her hair in two braids, and
she does not wear a silk hat! What of

An interesting papyrus recently discov
ered -shows that many of the ancient
Egyptians were quite as fond of drinking
good liquor as are any of the moderns.
In this papyrus, which is 3000 years old,
the philosopher Ani writes the following
words of warning on the subject of in
toxication to a student in Channu:
"I have been informed that you are not
only neglecting your studies, but that You
are also Indulging in the most frivolous
pleasures, and that you spend a good deal
of your time in drinking. Now, how can
it benefit you to drink so much beer every
day? Take advice and shun that insid
ious liquor."
practice frugality In Its use. The ink
training does not lead up to that virtue.
Now two colors make a fine tint. three
are less satisfactory, and four make mud!
Just here a mocker of progress, who
can't be taken seriously, called out to the
writer: "If fads must be given the glad
hand, why not make a fad of anatomy
and physiology and train up a regiment
of doctors? They are permitted to bury
their bad work, but the bad work of art
ists Is always likely to be hang-ing around
somewhere in plain view." Obviously the
fellow !s a pessimist.

and they are soon to return to the
Eastern cities. The solemnity of the
great house without gives the lie to Its
brightness within, and not the least of
this briehtness is its young visitor. The
potted palms seem a rather jollier green
when she Is there, and the marbles are
not quite so cnld. and the great mirrors
â  happier faces. Most cheerful of
all is her own cozy retreat upstairs, be
low whose window the hills drop away to
the town.
It had been planned that Mrs. Alexan
der was to introduce Miss Crocker to
!:i society this season, but the
dainty little golden-haired woman is so
ber now. for there is mourning In the
family. Mrs. Reid and Mrs. Mills will
make merry times, however, for the
young heiress. Mrs. Reid is not Aunt
Teenle in reality, being only the cousin
of Mrs. Crocker, but she is the sams as
an aunt to her cousin's child.
When New York receives Miss Crocker
it will find a tall, rather slender girl with
an expression tha{ is serious at first
glance, and animated only at closer ac
quaintance. The face is rather long, eyes
a bit dreamy. They droop at the corners
to give a sign of cleverness. Her mouth
is small and sweet. She is more striking
than beautiful. She is unusually bright
ami keen. Her disposition is sunny and
lovable, her opinions are pronounced and
her will is strong.
She dresses simply and beautifully, with
an eye of her own for color and form.
Her hair is worn in the heavy, forward
pompadour that Ethel Barrymore has
made famous.
Miss Crocker's height and dignity make
her at times appear more than her years,
but the girlish roguishness peeps out
from behind. Her personal attractions
bid fair to make her one of New York's
most famous, bo long as she shall grace
its fashions.
From other sources we learn that stu
dents in the land of the pyramids en
joyed their beer, and were quite as fond
of playing practical jokes as any of their
descendants.
From the diary of an Egyptian lieuten
ant who flourished about 2000 years ago
we obtain the interesting information
that a quart of beer cost about 5 cents,
and there are various entries in the book
which allow us to infer that tho average
Egyptian never dreamed of quenching hia
thirst with less than a quart at a time.
"Indeed," says the erudite Egyptologist
who has deciphered this diary, there ara
various facts which justify us In describ
ing the thirst of the ancient Egyptians
as pyramidal."

Â£~TvilS Man Who Dared" has been
I ', written In the shadow of the guil
â  I lotlr.o and the scenes and incidents
â¢ I . closely follow the history of the
J^ Reign cf Terror. Since its first pub
. â  libation in serial form It has been
materially altered in plot, giving It a
greater historical value, and considera
bly enlarging the text. The author, John
P. .Reiter, has handled his subject with
skill and realism and brought the horror
and despair and brutality of the period in
en echoing cry quite dawn the century.
In Us oft-repeated and stirring climaxes
the romance still bears the unmistakable
ear marks of the serial; hut, in the light
of sustained Interest,, this :s a good liter
ary pia/i, for it rushes the reader on to
the end without the dull feeling ever over
taking.him. Men's characters the author
handles with skill, but his heroine is
rather" too elaborately drawn in appear
ance and action to be quite human. She
Is more what, he would have ; .â¢â â¢r than
â what she would naturally have been. His
descriptions are realistic and convincing;
â his narrative easy and natural In style,
but his conversations are too often "by
the book. Excellent pen 'pictures are
given' of Danton, Marat, Robespierre, Si
mon. Tallien, .Carnot and others of thÂ«
Jacobin Club. The bachelor dinner of
Earrere is introduced and intimately de-
Ecribed, and other historical events are
used as background and to help the march
cf events.
Jean Louvet,. the man who dared, is the
hero ..who, when Robespierre is at, the
height of his power, pits his puny strength
as an obscure member of the convention
against the power of the chief and his
friends, that he may save Citizen Vau
ban..the father of the woman he loves,
from the executioner's ax. He appears
the quiet, stealthy instigator of the plot
for the overthrow of Robespierre, tor
qnly through his downfall can the re
lease of Vauban,,- arrested as a
suspect, be accomplished. In the
c.&urse. of the narrative father, daughter
and rescuer all are confined In tht Con
ciergerie, are even rattled in the awful
tumbrils over the avenue of blood to the
F!;n:e de la Revolution. They pass the ty
rant on the way, being taken in another
tumbril to the prison where the Paris
mob is hurling the idol of the last hour.
By a piece of strategy, the condemned
escape in their tumbril by being driven
hastily from the direction of death by a
driver who has been schooled in his part
by the friends of Louvet. The romance
cicses with the downfall and death of
Robespierre and the happy union and con
sequent thanksgiving of Jean and Louise.
The book is an easy and pleasant road
to a knowledge of the French history
of the time, and li well worth the hours
Bpent in Its company. The book is well

and steadily on the road to fortune and

roadsâ they all doâ but Alger's simplicity

tain value as amusement for the Im

The petroleum found In California Is as
variable In Its characteristics as the cli
mate of the Golden State. While all of It
Is good for fuel purposes there are marked
variations In Its specific gravity and Its
qualities not to be met with in the other
oil fields of the world. The oil found in
the Coalingra district is not alone useful
for fuel, but it Is also available for re
fining purposes and with the proper 31s
tilling device? it will yield illumiratine:
and It#>rlcating oils equal to those of
Pennsylvania. The California oil differs
from Eastern oil also lr. the fact that it
has an asphalt base, instead of a para Sine
base, and with proper handling this as
phalt base can be made to yield by
products of equaJ value v.lth paraffine.
There Is no doubt that the day will come
when a large share of the California pro
duction will be used for refining purposes,
bo that the possibility of an ov^-r-produc
tlon is a very remote and ill founded one.
There Is another use for petroleum in
Its crude state that will be found pecu
liarly acceptable to the' ranchers of Cali

roads. Crude oil applied to a dusty road

FORTUNES IN CHINA
THE Rothschilds, the Queen and
Lord Dudley own between them
most of the finest Sevres warÂ© In
EnglaiyL
The most famous of Lord Dudley's
Sevres Is a garniture de cheminee,
for which he gave $50,000; it Is said that a
housemaid broke one of the pieces the
day after Its arrival at Dudley House.
Lord Dudley a few years ago had a sale
of some of his porcelains.
The collection of Pon-padour and Du
tarry Sevres, as It Is sometimes styled.
In the possession of Queen Victoria has
been valued by experts at much over a
quarter of a million dollars. And yet
there are only a small number of pieces;
these are displayed at Windsor Castle, in
the long gallery, where her Majesty usu
ally receives her guests before dinner.
One and a half million dollars is said to bÂ«
the value of the Queen's poreclaln.
The value of old Sevres porcelain is en
hanced by the fact that ever since the
foundation>of the factory an exact regis
ter has been kept of all sales. Probably
the most extensive sale ever made was
that in 1778 to the Empress Catharine of
Russia, who paid for a service of 754 pieces
a sum of $80,000. which Is equivalent to
$200,000 at the present day. One hundred
and sixty pieces of this service were sto
len during a conflagration of the palace
and found their way to England, where
taev were purchased by the famous col*
newed once a year. It costs about $00 p>=r
mile to sprinkle a road with crude oil, and
this obviates the necessity of using water
on it. Already most of the counties in the
southern section of the State have begun
the work of making good, roads with the
use of petroleum.
To return to the matter of variations in
the character of the California oiis, it can
be stated that there are certain wells in
what is known as the Kreyc-nhagen dis
trict, which li< Â« south of Coalinga. where
a remarkably fine grade of oil. rich In lu
bricants, is produced. This oil when dis
tilled will sell from 26 cents to 85 cents
per gallon, and, of course, the crude oil.
which contains anywhere from 30 to 40
per cent of lubricants, will naturally bring
an enhanced price in the market. To-day
the crude oil for fuel purposes sells at
about $1 pÂ«r barrel at Oil City. In South
ern California the price at the wells Is
about $1 25 and higher, not because the
oil is better, but because It Is handy to
a market. When the pipeline has been
built from the new northern fields to this
city the producers will be enabled to get
a better price for their oil.
When a well has once been drilled into
the oil sand its current expenso ;s a very
small factor and Its production is largely
a matter of profit. The oil developments
down in the valley are' rapidly changing
the desert wilds to well populated cen
ters, and land that was formerly consid
ered too poor to bear even the burden of
a perfunctory homestead location in many
lector, Beckford. But with few excep
tions they were repurchased by the Em
peror Nicholas and conveyed back to
Russia just before the outbreak of the
Crimean war.
Prices that appear absolutely prepos
terous are given for Sevres china of the
"Pompadour period," which dates from
1753 to 1763; for that of the "Louis XII
period," which dates from 1763 to 1756,
and for that of "Louis XVI epoch," dat
ing from 1756 to 1790.
It Is nothingâ ssoo or $1000 apiece for a
Sevres cup and saucer, or a small pail or
a plateâ that is, nothing to a Rothschild
or a royalty.
The finest collection of Sevres in
America belonged to Governor Lyon of
Idaho; it was sold at his death, and one
vase was purchased by Mrs. Ayres of
Xcv,- York for $50(30.
A New York lady, Mrs. Arthur M.
Dodge, has some Sevres plate similar to
the famous Chanteau plates at Fontaine
bleau. She has also some delightful ex
amples of the old English ware Spode,
which was only made at first for royal
and ducal families, and was a great
luxury. Cabbage rases is a favorn.e pat
tern of the Spode ware, or some "set"
pattern of deep blue. Mrs. Dodge has a
tete-a-tete tea Fervice of Spode decorated
with the cabbage roses. She has some
Nyon cups and saucers. This ware â is
marked with a fish because the factory
Is situated on Lake Geneva. -
Mrs. Alfred Duane Pell is a collector of
fine china, and several specimor s it St.
Petersburg ware are treasured by her.
This is the only European factory which
never sells a piece of china, as everything
manufactured is reserved by the Czar and
Czarina for royal presents. It was found
ed by the Empress Catherine. Some of
Mrs. Pell's Russian porcelain is of a late
date, notably a plate made in 188 L Other
treasures arÂ» copies of the Prince of
Wales' Mintnn service, in use on his royal
yacht Osborne. They bear naval designs
and the three feathers and motto. Mrs.
Pell also has copies, in Minton, of Queen
Victoria's Buckingham Palace service.
The decorations are the rose, shamrock
and thistle; a crown and the initials
V. R. . within a wreath of roses.
Many multi-millionaires prize Minton
ware to the extent of paying $-'729 apiece
for plates. A plate of plain gold costs
lust about as much. For $136 50 one can
buy a crown derby plate which will an
swer everyday purposes.
Mrs. Bradley Martin eats her Monday
dinners from plates costing somewhere
about $173 each; of course, she has better
porcelain than this. Indeed she possesses
a large cabinet of china of great historical
value.
Mrs. Pierpont Morgan's choice is for
Chinese porcelains, which are not to be
compared with any others, so beautiful
are they, so their admirers claim. They
are as thin as paper, as brilliant as a mir
ror and as sonorous as metal. Mrs. Mor
gan has many examples of that most pop
ular of patterns â the one we can talk glib
ly aboutâ the willow pattern. This is on
what is called Turner's Caughley porce
lain. The romantic story is always a fa
vorite of the cruel father who lived in a
pagoda; the armed knight, the maiden
fair, an elopement, a stern parent in pur
suit and finally peace, plenty and happy
days under a blue tree on the other side
of the plate.
"Royal" was bestowed upon the Worces
ter porcelains when Queen Charlotte on
her visit to the factory with George 111
ordered a service; the pattern, by the
way, for this particular service was a lily.
Mrs. William Astor's favorite porcelain is

It is a story in the valley that when JoÂ«
Chanslpr and Charley t'anfield came to
tho site of what is now Oil City they had
lowered their finances to $16! Theso gen
tlemen to-day have an income of over
11000 per day each. In addition to their
splendid holdings at Oil City they have
quietly picked up thousands of acres oÂ£
land along the valley hilia, where the "oil
signs" tell plainly of the hidden treasures
below, and the day is not far distant
when thes* gentlemen will count their
wealth by millions; and all this stirring
sfory of financial enlargement is spanned
by but a few months' time. Such are tha
possibilities of oil. It Is not essential to
go to the Klondike when such opportu
nities are so near at hand.
Investigation has shown that the great
oil belts of California extend from 3aa
Diego County in the south to the Oregon

In regard to the White House china,
that ordered by Mr?. Hayes in 1579 was
the most elaborate and expensive, costing*
. which was pa;<l by the Govern
ment. A few duplicate sets were made of
this china. During Lincoln's time two
sets of china were made for thÂ« WhitÂ«
House. Sixty-one pieces of one service
now belong to Mrs. Dicklns. Pieces of
both sets have been scattered among
public and private collections throughout

Since the Spaniards relinquished their
sovereignty over Cuba, and the American
military forces assumed temporary pos
session the sanitary condition of Havana,
as well ns that of other cities of the "Gem
of the Antilles." has been raised to a high
modern standard. The work of disinfec
tion and sanitation which was effected
under General Wood has been the subject
of many articles and a tribute to the
talents of that brave a:id wise soldier
and surgeon.
As in the case of Santiago, Havana has
been thoroughly ckansed. To-day she la
one of the. tidiest cities of the Western
hemisphere, which is saying a deal for
the genius of the Yankee.
To the United States the labor of sani
tation In Cuba has been of great value,
and to the inhabitants of the isle It has
been, of course, a still greater blessing.

In which his germicide is made.
This plant was placed in operation at
the beginning of last July. It has a ca

was about $50.fW. It was erected after an
Investigation by the American military

charge of the work.
Sea water Is pumped into the vats of
the plant. It is then subjected to elec

that for his part he was in v partial
stupor, and that he did not fully realize
what was taking place. He remembers
to have wondered 1:1 a vague way why
Kervrndal acted so, and what had be
come of him after he had drowned him
self. For two days more the remaining
live members of the party clung to the
raft. :
Up to this point the story told by the
iiif-n i> connected and clear, but from the
fifth day on they give separate accounts
of what took place. The lirst of tkc&e is
to the effect that on the fifth day the
live remaining men of the party deter
mined to draw straws to see which of
them should die to supply food to the
others, while, according to the second ac
count which they give it was' not until
â¢several days lat< r that this .fateful lot
tery occurred â not until two of their
companions had died from exhaustion.
This latter story is the one which was
first told by Anderson and Thomas to the
crew of the steamer Woodruff, and It is
that which they nave most frequently re
peated since, They told me to-day that
about the. fifth or sixth day after their
shipwreck one of their comrades, Nikal
son, died from exhaustion. They said
that as they saw the end approaching
they hung over ins body, waiting for the
bnath to leave it in oruer tnat they
might eat the flesh. They protested that
the statement thai, they ha I taken this
man's life was inaccurate, but they ad
mitted that the blood {lowed from the
â body when tney cut into the tlesn and
.was -still warm. A day later a second
member of the party, Son risen, met -a
.similar fate. They drank his blood and
' ate . particiees of nis llesh, as they had
done the other man.
Andersen declares that they talked of
casting lots to determine who should die
lul a least tweiuy-iuur nours before they
finally agreed to do so. When at last
they "had made up their minds that no
other course was open to them they
picked three splinters from the pranks of
their raft and agreed tuat the one draw
ing the longest sliver should be lied by
the other two. Andersen himself held the
bits of wood, and Max Huffman, a Ger
man drew tirst.
For several minutes, according to An
dersen, they stood gazing steadfastly
each into the other's tace, and afraid to
â  open the hands In which the splinters
were tightly clasped. One bit 01 wood
.had purposely beta made much longer
than the other, so that there could i>e
no possible dispute as to the outcome of
the drawing. When at last the German
.-.,:.- known to have lost in the lottery
of life and death he made no protest, hut
accepted his fate -either with heroic for
titude or with stolid indliference.
: Tears course down Anderson's face a?
he tei the story and as he adds that In:
and. Thomas fought each other desperate
ly to determine which of the two should
drink llrst of the warm blood of their
victim. 'I hey linally settled the mattei
:by one gluing his lips to the gash ovei
the dean muli's heart and the other to 'ii'
. in his neck.
In his halting, broken way the seamar
.draws a horrible picture of the hours o!
torture that succeeded the death of hi?
comrade. He says he was too weak and ex
' hausted to fully realize what he had done
but his mind was continually racked wltf
v.ild fancies, in which the dead man con
tinued' to play his part. In his moment!
â¢ of delirium he Imagined that he was de
. fending himself from him. and he say:
that he can even now remember how hÂ»
i shouted and raved and called aloud to b<
protected from his imaginary attacks
The distress of mind displayed by th<
man as he tells these things is too cvi
â¢ dent to. leave a shadow of doubt as to the
â¢ .racy of his statements. Having
' iu.er.ehed their thirst in the German";
blood the two seamen fell upon his bods
â¢ and devoured its ilesh most ravenously
. For a few hours they were revived by this
. horrid feast; but they must quickly hayÂ«
lapsed again Into a half-crazed condition
When their raft was finally sighted bj
the Woodruff and approached by smal
boats Thomas was discovered seated 'â ;
the side of the horribly mutilated corps*
â  of the German, stripping bits of Host
from it, which he cast out to a school o:
. sharks which followed and fought abou'
the raft. Andersen sprawled upon thÂ«
planks, unable almost to move. The mer
wore 50 dazed by their sufferings ant
privations that they made no effort to at
. tract the attention of the people on thÂ«
steamship, and even when the boats cam*
; to their rescue they displayed signs 01
: neither Joy nor interest.
The men of the Woodruff declare thn.l
the spectacle presented by the raft Ktif.
its occupants was more horrible than any
thing of which they had ever dreamed
and even now the hardy seamen say the?:
- imaginations are still haunted by â ;. Tin
raft was smeared with the Mood of tlii
German and his dead comrades; :: .
â  planks were strewn with putrefying b!i^
of human flesh; the ghastly remains oÂ»
the dead seamen had Become offensive to
smell and sight, and beside 11 sat the ha 1:'
--' crazed Norwegian boy, feeding the shark'
and jabbering Incessantly to himself.
There has been n great deal of talk
here in regard to the taking of legal cog
nizance of the killing of the German, but
investigation seems to have established
the fact that there arc no grounds for
puch a procedure. It is said that the Ger
man Consul at this port was inclined to
Institute an investigation, but that h<
has subsequently abandoned the idea oi
doing, so. In the first place, the trial, it
one should ever be held, would have tc
take place in Norway at the home port n:
the bark Drot; and in. the second place
it seems to be a well-established principle
in the law of homicide that wherever
men agree together to cast lots, as dl< ;
Andersen, Thomas and the German, the
taking of a human life Is not reckoned a
murder so lons as no fraud Is practiced-

THE SUNDAY
CALL.
a t
day that
we became sc
r that w-"> tried
to put back into the shelter
of Hampton Roads. We failed. The wind
now shifted to northwest, driving us to
ward the Gulf Stream, straight off Pam
)i( i Sound. It was at this point that the
hurricane struck us.
"if I live fifty years longer I shall never
forget the Bight of that approaching fleet
of ids -messengers of destruction and
death. I shudder whenever I recall it
now, and my heart leaps as I thank God
for the terra lirma beneath my feet. I am
not a man who knows fearâ at least, I
never knew it till then. I went forward
and said to the mate: 'Rohde, I never
saw anything like this before. We are in
for it!" Rohde nodded, for he was speech
less, and his face plowed with a strange
pallor. The men were brought to decK
and the work of reefing and preparing for
the blast was begun In earnest.
"Now and then I turned a glance toward
the southeast, whence the dread black
cloud was rolling. As yet the sea was per
fectly calm, as if itself struck to stone
with amazement, turning from a green
ish purple to a dull drab. The glass went
down, down to 28. The sea and sky
Â£<eeniPd to meet, and both wore the Jooic
of the hangman. My men ran about the
deck and among the rigging like phan
toms in the half light, and afar was heard
the loar and rumble as of a hundred
earthquakes; with now and then a dart of
lightning, apparently fixing a rolling
length of yellow edged cloud to the waves.
At last came the blow, and such a blow!
It was like the hand of Omnipotence in
mighty wrath blotting us out of exist
ence. The good ship groaned and heaved

her. Day was turned into night and the
waves were new rolling mountain high over
the vessel. Crawling forward, nearly blind

I gained the stump of the mast, where,
with an ax, I cut the shrouds and the
splinters of clinging pine, and so set thÂ»Â»
useless lumber free. Instantly the ship
righted and I crept back to the wheel.
In the meantime the sailor ha ' again been

wave threw him bodily back into th<Â» ship

and our direction northwest. For twelve
hours, without food or drink, momentarily
expecting that the ship would give one
groan and topple over, we were lashed to
the quarterdeck, silent, calmly awaiting
the end. I had no more idea thai I should
ever see shore again than that the waters
would part and drop us upon dry land be
Â°"After a time I loosened myself and
crept below decks. There all was chaos.
An 800-gallon tank of fresh water was
crushed In by the flying debris, and there
in was our greatest loss. In the middle
of the wreckage, with the ship leaping
and plunging, yowling and struggling as
in the death throes I knelt alone and
prayed for the first time in forty yearsâ
for the first time since I arose from my
own good old mother's knee; and even
now, as I struggled to my feet. I thought
her there beside me again in very truth,
and a feeling of calm and assuring resig

back to the deck.
"Hour after hour we watched and won

in monosyllables. The hours went like
days, the* days like months. For four
days we drifted, now and then some one
creeping into the cabin and bringing out
a little biscuit or tobacco to stave on
hunger. Soon I was able to take
observations, and then ascer

"Next day we were sighted by the
Ames and two other vessels, whose cap

rrofesscrs la a great Eastern college, of her Intent! to mam" Colerr.ar..
and in spite of the fact that Col'rnan was at one time a favorite pupil the
match is most bitterly opposed by him. He arranges a trip to Greece, hoping to
prevent the wedding. Cclemar. calls on Marjory 'or an answer to his suit. To
try his affection she treats him co!d!y and announces her trip to Greece. He
misunderstands, and the result Is they say good-by In a most matter of fact
manner, but Marjory rushes in tears to her father, fully convinced that Cowman

man pets an aprolntrr.er.t as war correspondent of the Eclipse for the war in
Greece and sails via London. On the steamer he meets Nora Black, a celebrated
dancer ar.d an old friend, who pays him marked attention.
Co>n-ian rather slights the attentions of the fair Nora and in turn Is himself
snubbed. He leaves London without telling her good-by, although she tits r.ear
him at supper, ar.d from remarks 6he makes to her party he knows she is fond of
him. In Greece he learns that the Wainwrlght party are at Nikcpolis and In dan
ger I , ' go he sets cut for that po;nt at once.
Coleman finds the approach to Nikopolis surrounded with difficulties and r:
trace of the Walnwrl^hts. He receives a cablegram from the Eclipse to ascer
tain the whereabouts of the party at all hazards, as their position had already
created considerable comment '.:; America.
' He proceeds with a portion 01" the Greek cavalry toward Nikcpclis. The Greeks
hear cf reverses and suddenly retreat, leaving Coleman and his dragoman to get
back the best way they can. â .â â -â  and by a queer chance the Wain
â wrights overtake Co'.eniÃn on the road. They are unarmed and in a state of
trejidaticn. All are in danger of massacre by either Greek or Turkish hillsmen
ar.d the burden of taking the party to safety falls on Coleman. The party proceeds
on its way to Arta and meets the Greek outpost, but learns cf further dangers
ahead. To the surprise of all they meet Nora Black with a party on the road.
Coles ar.d party reach the Grecian settlement in safety. Nora Black 1 eg'.r.i
to make trouble. Co'-T.an dines alone with her and is afterward accused by
Coke of having made Â«j\e to her and beer, repulsed. A row ensues, which is in.
. terrupted by the interference cf the professor and the college students.
The professor and students take Colemai.'s ran. Coke sulks and will not
breakfast with the party. He meets Nora Black ar.d is asked by her to ride In
her carriage to Athens.
The party proceeds without Coke. They have a skirmish with peasants outside
of- a roadside inn. Colemcu: i? slightly wounded and in consequence he and Mar
jory again -declare their love fcr each ether. Coke and Nor> Black arrive at the
Inn and Ncra. assumes proprietorship of Coleman in such a way that he becomes
enraged, pettishly leaves the Walnwrights and proceeds on his way alone to the
railroad. At the station be !s delayed and sees the other party drive up, with his
rival, Coke, by Marjory's side.
[Continued.]
Now, since this poor girl was alone far off there in Greece, Mrs. Wain
â¢wrigfct announced that she had such full sense of her duty to her sex
thai her conscience would not allow her to scorn and desert a sister, even
If that sister was. approximately, the victim of a creature like Rufus
Cole-man. Perhaps the poor thing loved this wretched man. although it
vrai hard to imagine any woman giving her heart to such a monster.
â¢.'The professor had then asked with considerable spirit for me proofs
upon which Mrs.. YVainwright named Coieman a monster, and had made
a :wry face, over her completely conventional reply- He had told her cate
gorically his opinion of her erudition in such matters.
But Mrs. \\ ainwright was not to be deterred :rom an exciting espousal
of-'.t.he cause of her sex. On the instant that the- professor strenuously
opposed her she became an apostle, an enlightened, uplifted apostle to the
world on the wrongs- of her sex. She had come down with this thing as
if it were a disease. Nothing could stop her: Her husband, her daughter,
all influences in other directions, had been overturned with a roar, and the
lirst thing wholly clear to the proftssor's rr.ir.d had been that his wife was
riding afiably in the carriage with Nora Black.
â  Coleman aroused when he heard one of the students cry out: "Why.
there is Rufus Co'leman's dragoman. He must be here." A moment later
they -thronged, upon him. "Hi. old man. caught you again! Where did you
break to.?' Glad to catch you, old boy. How are you king it? Where's
jour horse?" -
. "Sent the horse? on to Athens,'' s;..id man. He had not yet re
covered his composure, and he was g!ad to find available this common
place return .to- their exuberant greetings and questions. "Sent em on
to Athens iwith .the groom."
In the meantime the engine of the little train was screaming to heaven
that'its jr.temion ofstarting was most serious. The diiigencia careened to
the station platform -and unburdened. Coleman had had his dragoman
place his luggage 4n a. little first-class carriage and he defiantly entered" It
end' closed' the door. He had a sudden return to the old sense of downfall,
end with ft came the original rebellious desires. However, he hoped that
. Homebody iwo.uld Intrude upon. him.
It was Peter Touriley. The student flung open the door and then yelled
to the distance: "Here's an empty one." He clattered into the compart

"Oh.:" they said v.-.hea they. saw the occupant of the carnage. "Oh:"
Cnlerrran was- furious. â¢ He could hnve distributed some cf his traps In a

r 'â¢ CHAPTER XXV.
There .was a dcrrror.stration of the. unequaled facilities of a European
railway carriage for rendering unpieasant things almost intolerable. These
people could. n:id no way to aileviatf the poignancy of their position. Cole
rr.an did not know where to look. Every personal manneris-m becomes ac
centuated m a European railway carriage. If you giance at a man. your
glance defines itself as a- stare. If you carefully look at nothing, you
create for yourself a resemblance lo all wooden-headed things. A news
paper Is. then, in' the nature of a preservative, and Cok-rr.an longed for a
newspauer. ." â  Â»
. It was this abominable railway carriage which exacted the first display
cf agitation from' Marjory. She Hushed rosily, and her eyes waved over
the compartment. Nora Black laughed in .i way that v. as a shock to th
r.erves. â¢ Coke -seemed very' angry indeed, and Pet*>r Tounley was in pitiful
distress. Everything was acutely painfully vivid, bald, painted as glar
ingly at a grocer's new wagon. It fulfilled those traditions which the
artists deplore when they use their .pet phrase on a picture. "It hurts."
The damn.i power of accentuation of the European railway carriage
seemed to Coleman's amazed mind to be redoubled and redoubled.
It was Peter -Tounley who seemed to be in the greatest agony. He
looked at the correspondent beseechingly and said: "It's a very cold
morning. Coleman." This was an actual appeal in the name of humanity.
Coleman came squarely to the front nd even grinned a little at poor
Peter Tounley s misery.' "Yes it is a cold morning, Peter. I should say it
Is one of the- coldest mornings In my recollection.
Peter Tounley had nnr intended a typical American emphasis on the
polar conditions which obtained in the apartment at this time, but Cole
man had given the word this meaning. Spontaneously everybody smiled,
and at once the tension. was relieved: -But of course the satanic powers of
the railway carriage could not be altogether set at naught. Of course it
fell to the lot of Coke to get the seat directly In front of Coleman, and
thus, face -to face. they., were doomed to stare at each other.
Peter' Tounley .was inspired to begin conventional babble, in which he
took great- care to making an appearance of talking to all in the carriage.
"Pur.ny. thing. 1 never knew these mornings i:. Greece were so cold. I
thought ' the climate hefe^was quite tropical. It must have been incon
renier.t in the ancient rimes, when,. Lara told, people didn't wear near so
manyâ clothes. Really. I don't see how .they stood It. For my part,
I : wi>uld like nothing ro'much as a buffalo robe. I suppose when these
great sculptors were -doing 'their masterpieces they had to wear gloves.
Ever think, of that? -Funny, .isn't !t? Aren't you cold. Marjory? I am.
Jingo' Imagine the Spartans In sters, going out to meet an â my in
cape-overcoats; and being desired by their mothers to return with their
ulsters or wrapped in pi.." :
It was 'rather hard work for Peter Tounley. Both Marjory and Cole
man tried to display an interest In his labors, and they laughed not at
â what he said, but because they believed it assisted him. The little train,
meanwhile, wandered up' a great green slope, and the day rapidly colored
the land.
At first Nora Black -did not display a militant mood, but as time
passed Coleman saw clearly that she was considering the advisability of
a new attack. She- had Coleman and Marjory in conjunction and where
they were unable to escape f!<".m her. The opportunities were great. To
Coleman, she ieerr-ed to be gloating over the possibilities of making more
mischief.' ; She was looking at him speculatively as if she considered the
best place- to hit him first. Presently she drawled: "Rufus. I wish you
would fix my rug about me a little better.". Coleman saw that this was
a beginning.. . ; ' â  .
Peter Tounley sprang to his feet with speed and enthusiasm. "Oh. let
me do It for you. 1 ' He had her well: muffled in the rug before she could
protest, even if a protest had been rational. The young man had no idea
of defending Coleman. â¢â¢ He had no knnwledee of the necessity for it. It
had been merely the exercise of his habit' of amiability, his chronic desire
to Eec everybody comfortable. His : passion in this direction was well
known in Washurst, where. the students had borrowed a phrase from the
photographers In order to describe him fully in nickname. They called
him "Look-pleasant Tounley." This <lid not antagonize In any way his
perfect willingness to fight on occasions with a singular desperation which
usually has a Email stool In every mind where good nature has a throne
"Oh/ thank you very much. Mr. Tounley," said Nora Black without
gratitude.-: "Rufus Is always -so- lax in these matters."
'.'1 don't know how you know it."', said Ooleman boldly, and he looked
her fearlessly in the eye. The battle -had begun.
"Oh." responded Nora airily. "I have had opportunity enough to know
it, I should think, by. this time." â 
'"No." Â«a:d Coleman, "since I have never paid you any particular and
direct attention, you cannot possibly know what I am Tax in and what
I am not lax in. I would be .-obliged to be of service at any time. Nora, but
surely you do not consider that you have a right to my services superior
to any. other right." â¢='â¢-. :
Nora Black simply went mad. but fortunately part of her madness was
in the form of speechlessness. Otherwise there might have been heard
something: approaching to billingsgate.
Marjory and Peter Tounley turned first hot and then cold and looked
an if they wanted to fly away, and even Coke, penned helplessly In with
this unpleasant incident, seemed to. have a sudden attack of distress. The
only frigid person was Coleman. He had made his declaration of Inde
pendence,, and he saw with glee that the victory was complete Nora
Black might storm arid rage, but he had announced his position in an un
conventional, blunt way. which nobody in the carriage could fail to under
stand. He felt somewhat like smiling wiih confidence and defiance in
Nora's face, but he still had thÂ» fear for -Marjory.
Unexpectedly the fight was all out of Nora Black. She had the fury
of a woman scorned,, but evidently she had perceived that all was over
end lost, . The. .remainder of her wrath dispensed itself in glares which
Coleman withstood with 'great composure. â 
â¢ A strained silence fell upon the group, which lasted until they arrived
at the little port of Mesalonghi. where they were to take ship for Patras
Coleman found himself wondering why he had not gone flatly at the great
question at a much, earlier period. Indeed at the first moment when the
great question began to make life exciting: for him. He thought that if he
had charged Nora's guns in the beginning they would have turned out to
be the same incapable artillery. Instead of that he had run away and
continued to run away .until he was actually cornered and made to fight
and his easy victory defined him as a person who had, earlier Indulged
In much stupidity and cowardice. . .
Everything had. worked out so 6imply. his terrors had been dispelled so
easily, that he probably was led to overestimate his success. And it oc
curred suddenly to him,. He foresaw a fine occasion to talk privately to
Marjory when all had boarded the steamer Tor Patras and he resolved to
make use of. it. This he believed would end the- strife and conclusively
. laurel him. â¢ '
The train finally drew uo on a little stone pier and some boatmen be
gan to scream like mills. The steamer lev at anchor In the placid blue
cove. The embarkation- was chaotio In the Oriental fashion and there
was the customary misery' which was only relieved when the travelers
had set foot on the deck of the stecmer. Coleman did not devot* any
premature attention to flndir.g Marjory, but when the steamer was fairly
out on the calm waters of the Gulf or Corinth, he saw her pacing to and
fro with Peter Tounley. At first he lurked in the distance waiting for an
opportunity, but ultimately he decided to make his own opportunity. He
approached them. "Marjory, would you let me speak to you alone for a
few n-i.'n^ms? You won't mind, will you, Peter?"
"Oh. no. certainly not," said Peter Tounley.
"< â¢: course. It is not some dreadful revelation, Is It?" said Marjory,
banterir.g him coolly.
"No," said Coleman abstractedly. He was thinking of what he waa
going to say. Peter Tounley vanished around the corner of a deckhouss
and Marjory and Coleman began to pace to and fro even as Marjory and
Peter Tounley had done. Cdeman had thought to speak his mind frankly
and once for all. and on the train he had invented many clear expressions
of his feeling. It did not appear that he had forgotten them. It seemed,
more that th"y had become entangled in his mind In such a way that he
'he end of his discourse.
In the pause, Marjory began to speak in admiration of the scenery. "I
â hat Greece was so full of mountains. One reads so much
Attic Plains, but aren't these mountains royal? They look so rugged
Id, whereas the bay is absolutely as blue as the old descriptions of
% t mmer sea."
"I wanted to speai to you about Nora Black." said Coleman.
Nora Black? Why? 11 said Marjory, lifting her eyebrows,
lou know well enough," said Coleman In a headlong fashion. "You
must know, you must have seen it. She knows I care for you and Bhe
wants to stop it. And she has no right toâ to interfere. She is a fiend, a
perfect fiend. She Is trying to rr.aJte you feel that I cars for her."
"And don't you care for her?" aeked Marjory.
"No." said Coleman vehemently. "I don't carÂ© for her at all."
very well," answered Marjory simply. "I believe you." She managed
to give the words the effect of a mere announcement that she believed
him and it was in no way plain that she waa g:ad or that she esteemed
the matter as being of consequence.
He scowled at her in dark cesentment. "You mean by that, I sup
pose, that you don't believe me?"
"Oh." answered Marjory wearily, "I believe you. I said so. Don't
talk at. out it any more."
"Then." said Coleman slowly, "you mean that you do not care whether
I'm telling the truth or not?"
"Why, of course I care." she said. "Lying Is not nice."
He did nnt know apparently exactly "how. to deal with her manner,
which was actually so pliable that it was marble. If one may speak in that
way. He looked ruefully at the sea. He had expected a far easier time.
"Wellâ" he began.
"Really," interrupted Marjory, "this is something which I do not care
to discuss. I would rather you would not speak to me at all about It.
It seems too â too â had. I can readily give you my word that I believe
you, but I would prefer you not to try to talk to me about it orâ anything
of that sort. Mother!"
Mrs. Wainwrlght was hovering anxiously In the vicinity and she now
bore down rapidly upon the pair. "You are very nearly to Patras " she
eaid reproach fully to her daughter as if the fact" had some fault of Mar
jory's concealed in it. She in no way acknowledged the presence of Cole
man.
"Oh, are we?" cried Marjory.
"Yes," said Mrs. Wainwrlght. "We are!"
She stood waiting as if she expected Marjory to instantly quit Cole
man. The girl wavered a moment and then followed her mother. "Good
by," sho said to Coleman. "I hope we may see you again In Athens." It
was a command to him to travel alone with his servant on the long rail
way journey. It was a dismissal of a casual acquaintance given so gra
ciously that It stung him to the depths of his pride. He bowed his aaieu
and his thanks. When the yelling boatmen camÂ« again he and his man
proceeded to tho' shore In an early boat without looking In any way after
the welfare of the others.
At the train the party split Into three sections. Coleman and his man
had one compartment. Nora Black and her squad had another and the
Walnwrights and students occupied two more.
The little officer was still in tow of Nora Black. He was very enthusi
astic. In French she directed him to remain silent, but he did not appear
to understand. "You tell him," she then said to her dragoman, "to sit In
a coiner and not to speak until I tell him to. or I won't have him
in here." She seemed anxious to unburden herself to the old lady compan
ion. "Do you know," she said, "that girl has a nerve like steel 9 I tried
to break it there in that inn. but I couldn't budge her. If I am going to
have her beaten I must prove myself to be a very, very artful person ' 7
"Why did you try to break her nerve?" asked the old lady, yawning
""Why do you want to have her beaten?"
"Because I do. old stupid," answered Nora. "You should have heard
the things I said to her."
"About what?"
"About Coleman. Can't yoti understand anything at all?"
"And why should you*ay anything about Coleman to her?" queried
the old lady, still hopelessly befogged.
"Because," cried Nora, darting a look of wrath at her companion. "I
want to prevent that marriage." She had been betrayed Into this avowal

"Oh ho. she Bald; as If a ray of light had been let Into her head. on,

"Yes, that's it." rejoined Nora, shortly. _Â.â-. it i..*
The old lady was amazed Into a long period of meditation. 'Those

Victim of glamour only because she wished it to be true. One theor/.
however, remained unshaken. Marjory was an artful minx, with no truth
in her.
She presently felt the necessity of replying to the question of her com
panion. "Oh," she said carelessly, "I suppose they were acquaintedâ in a
way."
The old lady was giving the best of her mind to the subject. "If that's
the caseâ " she observed, musingly, "if that's the case, you can't tell what
is between 'em."
The talk had so slackened that Nora's unfortunate Greek admirer felt
that here was a good opportunity to prefer, t himself again to the notice of
the actrt^s. The means was a smile anJ a. French sentence, but his recep
tion Wluid have frightened a man in armor. His face blanched with hor
ror at the storm he had evoked, and he dropped limply back as if some one
had shot him. "You tell this little snipe to let me alone!" cried Nora to
the dragoman. "If he dares to come around me with any more of those
Parisian dude speeches, Iâ l don't know what I'll do! I won't have it I
say." The impression upon the dragoman was hardly less In effect. Â£lÂ«
looked with bulging eyes at Nora, and then bogan to stammer at the offi
cer. The latter's voice could sometimes be heard in awed whispers for the
more elaborate explanation of some detaU of the tragedy. Afterward he
remair.od meek and silent in hip corner, barely more thai a shadow, like
the proverbial husband of imperious beauty.
"Well." said the old lady, after a long' and thoughtful pause, "I don't
know. I'm sure, but it seems to me that if Rufus Coleman really cares for
that girl there isn't much use in trying to stop him from getting her. HÂ»
isn't that kind of a man."
"For heaven's sake, will you stop assuming that he does care for her?"
demanded Nora, breathlessly.
"And I don't see," continued the old lady, "what you want to prevent
him for, anyhow."
"I feel in this radiant atmosphere that there could be no such thing as

sor's words were for the benefit of his wife and daughter. He was viewing
the sky-blue waters of the pu!f of Corinth wi'h its background of moun
tains that in the sunshine were touched here and there with a copperish
glare. The train was slowly sweeping along the southern shore. "It is
strange to think of those men fighting up there in the north. And It is
strange to think that we ourselves are but Just returned from it."
"I cannot begin to realize it yet," said Mrs. Wainwrtght in a high voice
"Quite so." responded the professor, reflectively. "I do not suppose any
of us will realize it fully for some time. It la altogether too odd too very
odd."
"To think of It!" cried Mrs. Wainwrlght. "To think of It! Supposing
those dreadful Albanians or those awful men from the Greek mountains
had caught U3? Why, years from now I'll wake up In the night and think
of It'"
The professor mused. "Strange that we cannot feÂ«l It strongly now
My logic tells me to be aghast that we ever got into such a place, but mv
nerves at present refuse to thrill. I am very much afraid that this singu
lar apathy of ours has led us to be unjust to poor Coleman."
Here Mrs. Wainwright objected. " 'Poor Coleman!' I don't see why
you call him 'poor Coleman.' " J
"Well," answered the professor Blowly, "I am In doubt about our be
havior. Itâ"
"Oh," cried the wife gleefully, "in doubt about our be-havlor! I Â»m in
doubt about his behavior." ln
"So, then, you do have a doubt of his behavior?"
"Oh, no," responded Mrs. Wainwright hastily. "Not about Its bad
nets. What I mean to say was that in the face of his outrageous conduct
with thatâ that woman. It is curious that you should worry about our be
havior. It surprises me, Harrison."
Th% prof-isor was wagging his hrad sadly. "I don't know â¢ â¢ I don't
know â¢ â¢ It seems hard to jjdge â¢ â¢ I hesitate to â "
Mrs. Wainwright treated this attitude with disdain, 'at 1b not hard to

The professor got angry. "Nonsense! Nonsense! I do not believe that
he brought her. If I ever saw a spectacle of a woman bringing hei-Belf It
was then."
"Well," retorted Mrs. Wainwright, bridling, "I suppose you lmajrina
that you understand such things. Men usually think that, but I want to
tell you that you seem to be utterly blind."
''Blind or not. do stop the everlasting reiteration of that sentence "

The professor hastily lit the gas and then father and mother
hurriedly to the bed. In the first of the Illumination they saw that tears
were flowing unchecked down Marjory's face.
The effect of this grief upon the professor was In part an effect or fear.
He seemed afraid to touch it. to go near It. He could evidently only re
main In the outskirts, a horrified spectator. The mother, however, flung:
cer arms about her daughter. "Oh, Marjory." She, too. was weeping.
The girl turned her face to the pillow and held out a hand of protest.
"Don't, mother! Don't:"
"Oh. Marjory! Oh, Marjory!" _ ti . . â
"Don't, mother. Please go away. Please go away. Don t speaK at an,

"Oh. Marjory! Oh, Marjory!
"Don't." The girl lifted a face which appalled them. It had something
entirely new in it. "Please go away, mother. I will speak to father, but I
won'tâ l can'tâ l can't be pitied."
Mrs Walnwright looked at her husband. "Yes." said the old man,
trembling "Go!" She threw up her hands in a sorrowing gesture that
wee not without its suggestion that her exclusion would be a mistake. She
The professor dropped on his knees at the bedside and took one of
Marjory's hands. His voice dropped to its tenderest note, "Well, my Mar-
Vhe had turned her face again to its pillow. At last she answered in
muffled tones. "You know." , , T1 Â
Thereafter came a long silence full of sharpened pain. It was Marjory
who spoke first. "I have saved my pride, daddy, butâ l haveâevery
thingâ Even her sudden resumption of the old epithet of her child
hood was an additional misery to the old man. He still said no word. Ho
knelt, gripping her fingers and staring at the wall.
"Yes, I have lostâ everythingâ else. '
' The father gave a low groan. He was thinking deeply, bitterly. Sine*
one was only a human being, how was one going to protect beloved hearts
assailed with sinister fury from the inexplicable zenith? In this tragedy
he felt as helpless as an old gray ape. He did not see a possible weapon
with which he could defend his child from the calamity which was upon
her There was no wall, no shield which could turn this sorrow from the
heart of the child. If one of his hand's loss could have spared her there
would have been a sacrifice of his hand, but he was potent for nothing.
He could only groan and stare at the wall.
He reviewed the past half in fear that he would suddenly come upon
Ms error which was now the cause of Marjory's tears. He dwelt long upon
the fact that in Washurst he had refused his consent to Marjory's mar
riage with Coleman, but even now he could not say that his Judgment was
not correct. It was simply that the doom of woman's woe was upon Mar
jory, this ancient woe cf the silent tongue and the governed .'.'.. and he
could only kneel at the bedside and stare at the wall.
Marjory raised her voice In a laugh. "Did I betray myself? Did I be
come the maiden all forlorn? Did I giggle to show people that I did not
care? Noâ l did notâ l did not. And it was a long time, daddy: Oh
such a long time! I thought we would never get here. I thought I would
never get wh+re I could be alone like this, where I â cryâ I wanted
to. I am not much of a crier, am I, daddy? But this timeâ this time-
She suddenly drew herself over near to her father and looked at him.
"Oh daddy, I want to tell you one thing. Just one simple little thlcg.'
She waited then, and while she waited her father's head went lower and
lower. "Of course you knowâ l told you once. I love him! I love him I
Yes probably he is a rascal, but. do you know. I don't think I would mind
If he was aâ an assassin. This morning I sent him away, but, daddy, he
didn't want to go at all. I know he didn't. This Nora Black is nothing to
him I know she is not. I am sure of It. "i â I am sure of It.
I never expected to talk this way to any living creature, butâ you are so
rood, daddy. â¢ â¢ Dear old daddyâ"
She ceased, for she saw that her father was praying.
The sight brought to her a new outburst of sobbing, for her sorrow
now had dignity and solemnity from the bowed white head of her old
father, and she felt that her heart was dying amid the pomp of the church.
It was the last rites being performed at the deathbed. Into her ears cam*
come Imagining of the low melancholy chant of monks In a gloom.
Finally her father arose. He kissed her on the brow. "Try to sleep,
dear," he said. He turned out the gas and left the room. His thought
was full of chastened emotion.
But If his thought was full of chastened emotion it received some de
gree of shock when he arrived in the presence of Mrs. Wainwright.
"Well what is all this about?" she demanded Irascibly. "Do you mean to
â ay that Marjory Is breaking her heart over that man Coleman? It is all
your faultâ" She was apparently still ruffled over her exclusion.
When the professor interrupted her he did not speak with his accus
tomed spirit, but from something novel in his manner she recognized, a
danger signal.
"Please do not burst out at It in that way."
"Then It Is true?" she asked. Her voice was a mere awed whisper.
"It is true," answered the professor.
"Well." she said, after reflection. "I knew it. I always knew it. If
you hadn't been so blind. You turned like a weather cock in your opinions
of Coleman. You never could keep your opinion about him for more than
an hour. Nobody could Imagine what you might think next. And now
you see the result of it! I warned you: I told you what this Coleman
was. find if Marjory Is suffering now, you have only yourself to blame for
It. I warned you:"
"If it Is my fault." said the professor drearily. "I hope God may for
give me. for here is a great #-ong to my daughter." '--_â¢ -
"Well, if you had done as I told youâ" she began.
Here the professor revolted. "Oh, now, do not begin on thai," he
snarled peevishly. 'Do not begin on that."
"Anyhow," said Mrs. Wainwright. "It is time-that we should be going
down to dinner. Is Marjory coming?"
"No, she is not," answered the professor, and I do not know as 1
shall go myself."
"But you must .go. Think how it would look! All the students down
there dining without us. and cutting up capers! You must come." v
"Yes" he said dubiously, "but who will look after Marjory?"
"She' wants to be left alone." announced Mrs. Wainwrieht. as if she
was the particular herald of this news. "She wants to be left alone."
.'/Well I suppose we may as well g-o down."
Before they went the professor tipfoed into his daughter's room. In
the darkness he could only see her waxen face on the pillow, and her two
eyes gazing fixedly at the ceiling. He did not speak, but immediately with
drew, closing the "door noiselessly behind him.
CHAPTER XXVII.
If the professor and Mrs. Wair.wright had descended sooner to a lower
floor of the hotel they would have found reigning there a form of anarchy.
The students were in a smoking room, which was also an entrance hall to
the dining room, and because there was in the middle of this apartment
a fountain containing gold fish they had been moved to. license and sin.
They had all been tubbed and polished and brushed and dressed until they
were exuberantly beyond themselvs. Th proprietor of the hotel Brought
In his dignity and showed it to them, but they minded it no more than if
he had been only a common man. He drew himself to his h*Â£h: arid
looked gravely at them and they jovia'.iy said. "Hello, whiskers.^ Ameri
can college students are notorious In their country for their inclination to
scoff at robed and crowned authority, and far from being awed by the
dignity of the hotelkeeper they were delighted -with it. It was something
with which to sport. With immeasurable impudence they copied his atti
tude, and standing before him made comic speeches, always alluding with
blinding vividness to his beard. His exit disappointed them. He had tot
remained long under fire. They felt that they could have interested them
selves with him an entire evening. '"Come back, whiskers! Oh, come
back!" Out in the main hal! he made a gesture of despair to some of his
gaping minions and then fled to seclusion.
A formidable majority then decided that Coke was a gold fish and tha*
therefore his proper place was in the fountain. They carried him to It
while he struggled madly. This quiet room, with its crimson ruga and
gilded mirror?, seemed suddenly to have become an important apartment
in hell. There being as yet no traffic in the dining room, the waiters were
all at liberty to come to the open doors, where they stood as men turned
to stone. To them it was no less than incendiarism. . -
Coke, standing with one foot on the floor and the other on the bottom
of the shallow fountain, blasphemed his comrades in a low tone- but with
Intention. He was certainly desirous of lifting his foot out of the water
Dut it teemed that all movement to that end would have to wait until ha
had successfully expressed his opinions. In the meantime there was heard
slow footsteps and the rustle of skirts and then some people entered thÂ»
smoking room on their way to dine. Coke took his foot hastily out of th*
fountain.
The faces of the men of the arriving party went blank, and they turned
their cold and pebbly eyes straight to the front, while the ladies after little
expressions of alarm, looked as if they wanted to run. In fact, the whola
crowd rather bolted from this extraordinary scene.
"There, now," said Coke bitterly to his companions. "Ton see? 'VTa
looked like little schoolboysâ" ?. .
"Oh, never mind, old man," said Peter Tounley. "We'll forgive you.
although you did embarrass us. But, above everything, don't drip. What
ever you do. doit*t drip." â¢ .
The students took this question of dripping and played upon It until
they would have made quite Insane anybody but another student. They
worked it into ail manner of forms and hacked and haggled at Coke until
he was driven to his room to seek other apparel. "Be sure and change,
both legs," they told him- "Remember you can't change onÂ© leg without
changing both legs."
After Coke's departure the United State* Minister entered the room'
and instantly they were, subdued. It was not his lofty station that affected"
them. There are probably few stations that would have at all affected
them- They became subdued because they unfeignedly liked the- Unitd
States Minister. They were suddenly a group of well-bred, correctly attired
young men, who had not put Coke's foot in the fountain. Nor had they
desecrated the majesty of the hotelkeeper. ; . '
"Well. I am delighted," said the Minister, laughing:, as he shook hand*
â¢with them all. "I was not sure I would ever see you again. You are not
to be trusted, and good boys as you are I'll be glad to see you once and
forever over the boundary of my Jurisdiction. Leave Greece, you vaga
bonds. However, I am truly delighted to see you all safe." â¢
"Thank you, sir," they said.
"How in the world did you get out of it? You must be remarkable
chaps. I thought you were in a hopeless position. I wired and cabip'i
everywhere I could, but I could find out nothing " Â»u--a

"Coleman?" asked the Minister quickly.
"Yes. sir. He found us and brought us out safely."
"Well, glory be to Coleman, eclaimed the Minister after a lonr -<,>,
of surprise. "Glory be to Coleman! I never thought he could do it '"
The students were alert immediately. "Why, did you know about it

Cocked hats came in vogue in New
England when they did in England. They
were richly trimmed with metal laces,
cords, caddis, ferret, buttons, ribbons,
cockades and rosettes. They were oft
times colored In several shades. Puritan
women also wore felt, beaver and castor

did the men.

About 1655 straw hats became fashion
able in England, where they were called
"Churchllls." Fine Leghorn hats cost
from 16 to 50 shillings apiece. In 1751 chip
hats were sold in the States.
In 1754, in an old copy of th? Salem
Gazette, "Air Balloon" and "Princess"
hats are advertised. These were French
fashions. A large brimmed hat was fash

CHERIEâ The best way to cover up the
bones in that neck of yours is to start in
on a fattening: diet. Then, if you will melt

would reiterate the advice of your family.
"Let your skin alone." You are too young 1
to begin dabbing things on your face, un
less your skin happens to need something
in the way of a cold cream or skin food.
In that case you can rely upon any of
the formulas given in this department.
Don't bother about the freckles, unless
they are something awful. With proper
protection of the face when exposed to
wind or sun they will soon fade out.
Above all things don't try anything and
everything you happen to hear of, or you
will soon have no complexion to experi
ment on. "Which do men admire the
more the free, Jolly girl or the modest,
sincere one?" Dear! cear:*what a ques
tion for a beauty column. Don't you
think one of the "dear creatures" would
be better qualified to answer that ques
tion than a "mere woman." Suppose we
extend an invitation to some of the "men
folks" who occasionally peep into this de
partment (oh, they needn't deny that they
do peep, for we know better), to send us
a few opinions on the subject. A few of
these addressed to Mme. Hygela, The
Sunday Call, will be gladly aired in this
department. In the meantime, let me give
you one woman's idea of the character
istics she believes to be popular with the
sterner sex. They have- been condensed
into the following recipe: "Wit, nicely
flavored with wisdom; tart Imagination
and sympathy in equal quantities; the
essence of cheerfulness u*ed freely; in
telligence according to taste; admiration
for man ad libitum; flavor sparingly v.ith
common sense; add a. dash of coquetry;
mix well with the milk of human Und
ress; mold into graceful shape and serve
with sauce piquantÂ©."
A. W, McA âThe lunar caustic can be
procured at any drug store. Pure lemon
juice applied to the skin and left to dry
on. followed by a liberal smearing with
cold cream,* will usually annihilate
freckles.
THELMA ERRINGTONâ think all
that your flair needs is vigorous 'rush
ing and perhaps a little olive oil applied
to the roots occasionally. Also see to it
that the split ends are all removed. The
hair will not grow as lonpr as the ends
are split. Keep the scalp thoroughly
clean and free from dandruff, and your
hair v.ill surely grow.
GENEVIEYE Your circulation Is
sluggish probably from lack of exercise
in the open air, which no doubt is re
sponsible in part for the condition of your
skin. The diet has much to do also with
the coming of facial blemishes. Eat all
the fruit that you possibly can. Stop eat
ing all pastries or rich sweets. Register
a boycott on pickles, broiled lobsters and
all such complexion destroyers. When
ever you are in doubt how to spend thÂ©
next "half hour take a bath or indulge
in outdoor exercise. If the pimples still
persist In coming, then invest in some
taraxacum pills. (Extract of dandelion.
1 dram; rhubarb, q. s. ; divide into three
and a half grain pills.) Take one every
night. Then, If I were you, Genevieve, I
would apply a solution of bichloride of
mercury. Remember this: Bichloride of
mercury is a deadly poison. At the same
time. In proper proportions, it is a heal
ing medicine, like many other poisons.
One part of the mercury to 200 parts of
warm water makes a splendid skip

pies. It 1c to be applied with a small, soft
sponge, and dabbed on for five minutes
at a time. Yes. rubbing th*> oil into the
hair will certainly make the hair oily
and stringy while you are using it, and'
you will probably have to shampoo it
once a week. I should continue it until
I felt that the hair had been benefited.
The little lines about the eyes can be
eradicated by massaging with the orange
flower skin food. Also be careful, tf you
sleep on a pillow, that the pillow doe 3

Let u.s take the transport service first,
rs being fax the most Important. The
big white painted steamers have been
coming: in and going out of the
Golden Gate, for so many months that
the public lias grown quite accustomed
to this constant movement of troops, and
fail to realize Its magnitude. The Grant,
the Sherman, the Sheridan and a dozen
other huge vessels Bteal silently up to
the Folsom street dock, discharge their
living â  argoes, take on board another con
signment of food for powder and are off
again to the seal of war, almost before
any one realizes what is happening. The
Folsom street wharf, now dedicated en
tirely to the Government service, has be
come a perfeel hive of orderly Industry.
In the rarly days of the war the trans
ports were scattered here, there and
everywhere along the water front. The
separation of the ships led to confusion
and delay and Involved much extra ex-
ThlH chaotic state of affairs could not
last long. As soon as it was seen that
the war in the Philippines was likely to
become a p rmanent institution, a con
stant drain upon ttie resources of this
country, the Government took steps to
secure a fixed home for Its transports.
The Folsom street dock, probably one of
the beet on the front, was handed over to
"Qod bless you. my boys,"
said Pewey.
" 'Admiral Dowey }iresents his compli
ments,' etc., paid a breathless sailor,
standing In the floor of the ward. At the
most 1 had expected an Invitation from
Dewey to assist him on the Olympia, That
he himself that very day would come to
the Relief seemed Incredible.
"I was on special duty putting hot com
presses on a soldier. 'I will he there as
.is another nurse relieves me,' was
the message I sent to Admiral Dewey. I
knew that the admiral would understand,
und hi did.
"1 lewey shook both my hands, declaring
that our mut,ual friends made us other
than strangers. Ho inquired after this
friend with that warmth and feeling that
proved to me that there is nothing half
hearted In the friendship of Admiral
Dewey. He asked after the children, call
ing them by name.
"Admiral Dowey is a man who Is exceed
ingly fond of children. His face lights up
the quartermaster, and under the man
agement of Captain Bameson, the chief
of the dock, a thoroughly efficient staff
has been organized. No matter how great
a rush there may be, affairs at the dock
move with the orderly regularity of mili
tary service. The department does all its
own stevedoring, and employs on occa
sion hundreds of longshoremen. For -he
use of this wharf alone the Harbor Com
missioners receive $187 a month. In ad
dition to this the Government pays wharf
age dues on all transports at any of the
docks. Thus the Sherman, when In port
pays the Stato of California about $n' a
day, the Grant $15, the Sheridan $15 aid
so on for smaller vessels. The pilots too
have benefited Immensely by this trans
port service. As they are paid by fees
according to the tonnage of the vessels'
they guide in and out of port, their earn
ings have been largely Increased by th<?
advent of these big Government vessels
But perhaps the best idea of the extent
of tho operations now being carried on
may be gathered from a Pimple list of
the transports which have left this harbor
for Manila. Since May, last year, no less
than eighty-five vessels have' sailed car
rying altogether the population of a de
cent sized cityâ more than fifty thousand
officers nnd men. In addition there are
the troops which have returned; but as
their arrival has been so recent I will not
concern myself with them. I have been
fortunate enough to obtain a complete
list of the departing transports, com

This makes a total, up to the last date
of eighty-five ships and 52.308 ofScers and
men. In addition to this some eighteen
transports are scheduled to sail during
the present month, and many of them
will probably have got away by the time
this article appears In print. It is no
wonder that the expenses of the depart
ment are heavy. Colonel Long Informed
me that the Government spent on the
transport service, on this coast alone
from the commencement of the war ud
to Juno 30, the end of the. fiscal year
more than 512.000.n00. Tho sum does not
include the purchase price paid for ships
bought outright by the nation. This
means an average outlay of $1,000 000 a
month, a sum which at present Is con
siderably exceeded.
If we turn to the Subsistence Depart
ment we find things being done on an
equally huge scale. The cost of feeding
soldiers comes to about $6 a month, so
that the monthly expenditure on 8000
men camped at the Presidio would run
to nearly $50,000. Then there are the
transports to be provisioned for the voy
age to Manila. At least a month's sup
ply would be needed for this trip and so
for 50,000 men we get an outlay of $300,000
for sea stores alone. After the men land
at Manila they must still be fed and the
bulk of their rations are shipped from
here. To meet this enormous demand the
Subsistence Department has dispatched,
during the past year no lees than 20,000,
--000 pounds, of freight.
It is no wonder that the provision men
are jubilant, that the wholesale dealers
of Market and . Battery and Sansome
jingle the dollars in their pockets and
watch contentedly while Uncle Sam
pours blood and treasure into a foreign
land. Every class of producer has bene
fited, tho farmers have sold their crops
of onions, and beans, and dried fruit' hay
oats, forage of all kinds has been in con
stant demand; the cracker factories have
been working day and night to meet the
need for hardtack, while the canneries
have had all they could do to supply
tinned fruits, soups and other delicacies
The clothing and shoe factories have
profited equally, In fact there Is hardly
a branch of trade which has not been di
rectly or indirectly affected.
But the best Idea of quantity required

Femininity
whon hÂ«.Â» speaks of them, and his voicÂ«Â»
always pleasant, has an almost tender
ring. For twenty minutes he plied ma
with question? about these youngsters in
far away Washington, showing an ab-
Borbing interest in the most trifling de
tails.
"Satisfied on these points, the admiral
asked me why 1 had not at once presented
my letter. Rather embarrassed. I crude
ly answered that I had been 'too busy.
Before I could sugar-coat my mistake
Dewey, with appreciative sympathy, re
plied that 'he understood.' He fett
pleased rather than otherwise, and plain
ly showed it.
"I was agreeably surprised to find the
admiral a singularly handsome man of the
eagle type. The bad points in his features
â tare Intensified by the camera, and his
most charming and characteristic expres
sion, piercing yet kind, has never -been
caught in any picture that I have seen.
"Dewey is a gentleman of the old school
âCourteous and thoughtful in the ex
treme. As we stood on deck a native
woman of low caste dropped some fruit
out of a basket which she was carry'"*-
Other officers saw it, but not until Dewey
made the first movement did they at
tempt to pick it up. The admiral was too
quick for them, and with a kindly smile
put it Into the basket for the woman. This
pleased me, and showed the fine fiber ot
Dewey's courtesy.
"The admiral asked to be shown o\er
the ship and had a kindly word for every
one. we cannot but realize- the Interest
with which his every movement is re
garded, yet not a tinge of condescension
has crept into his speech. He is the quin
tessence of modesty.
"As we passed through a ward where
were the seriously injured, a young boy
with youthful impulsiveness cried out.
'What's the matter with Dewey?
11 'He's all right!' came in weak chorus
from the lads so close to the valley or
shadows. Pallid cheeks flushed, sunken
eyes glistened; those who- could p.ainfuly
raised their, weary heads and then, -with
pitiful effort, they gave a tiger, too.
Voice after voice hushed or broke; ut
" 'God bless you, my boys,' said Dewey,
huskily, and with eyes that saw net for
tears he shook hands with each and every
one of them.
"Tea was served, Dewey chatting 7 fra
ternally with Jhft officers and nurses. He.
talks easily and well without being garru
lous on subjects of general interest. Men
tion his own deeds and he shrinks &3

"Dewey Bpoke of his friendly relation*
with several Philippine . families and
afterward took me to call on them. Tha
children greeted him with ' cries of de
light, and he returned their caresses. Our
visits were highly appreciated, they con
sidering a call from Dewey. a distinction
and honor. Both of these families UVed
In houses with plain exteriors and rur
niFhlngs gorgeous in satins and gilt. Tha
admiral evidently notices -such things, for
he remarked on our way back how much,
more homelike plain furniture made â¢

"I received, come beautiful Philippine
cloths and gauzes from these- people
which I showed to Dewey. He com

then said that he thought the Philip

much more graceful and. sensible than
ours. Admiral Dewey. while he is a big
man of big affairs, is not blind, .to the'
little things that count for much in the
sum totals. He Is an acute observer in
every sense of the word.
"After one of these visits Dewey re
marked that he did not think the friend

enough to last should he in any way In
terfere with Philippine liberty. 'What
they want is liberty, he said. "They- re
gard me as their liberator from the Span
ish, and as such appreciate me. Were
I in turn to help put new masters over
them they would surely oppose me as
bitterly.' The frank and evidently sin
cere friendliness of these people would

by the Subsistence Department Is to be â¢
gathered from Its proposal form. The
department deals with the merchants and
every month or so sends out a list of the
articles it requires. Inviting tenders for .
their supply. The list covers a huge
printed sheet the size of this newspaper
and makes mention of nearly every kind of
eatable. It is impossible tor produce the
document in its entirety, but I will go
over a few of the leading items. .
In the matter of meat, our soldiers need
10,000 pounds of salt pork and 10,000 pounds
or salt beef. Bacon Is a still more popu
lar article, for 50,000 pounds of it are re- :-'.
quired. Tinned soup Is a much more lux- :*
urious diet, and I suppose the officers get
most of It. They need 1200 quart cans of
beef soup, 1000 of chicken, 1200 of clam
chowder, 1200 of mock turtle and 1200 of
oxtail. Six thousand pounds of dried fish.' :
are asked for, and 400,000 pounds of extra
family flour. In addition, there are 10,
--000 pounds of hard bread, 6000 pounds of
cornmeal, 50,000 pounds of beans and 1200
pounds of hominy. For drinking there/ .-.-.
are 12,000 pounds roasted coffee, .1700.
pounds tea, 5000 gallons of the strongest
vinegar and 1200 gallons of syrup neu
tralize each other. For condiments there
arc 40,000 pounds of salt and 1000 pounds â 
of pepper. Fruit is in great demand.-
Nineteen thousand two hundred two and ' â .
a half pound cans of apples are asked V
for, 60,000 pounds of evaporated apples, â  â 
12,000 cans apples, 12,000 cans apricots, 12,
--000 cans peaches. 60,000 pounds 'â¢ evapor- â '
ated peaches, 12,000 cans pears, 3000 cans '
pineapple, 3000 cans damson preserve.' and â 
60,000 pounds dried prunes. These are the
chief articles on the list which may be
called necessaries, but there follows a .'â¢â 
long string of luxuries, most of them, I
suppose, intended for sale to the officers' â¢ '.-'
mess. There are 36,000 pounds of. butter, 3600'
â¢ pounds fancy chocolate, 1200 cans aspara- i
pus, 1200 cans string beans. COCO cans green' '
corn and 1200 cans peas. Smaller quanti- ':
ties are required of almost every article-"'
of table luxury, such as clam bouillon^,
succotash,, curry powder, cocoa, marma
lade, beef extract, crabs, crackers, mac-.
aroni, mushrooms, deviled ham. spices, â¢ -
oils, pickles, etc. Fancy Jams are in
great demand. 24.000 two-pound cans being
railed for, and the army must be a post*::

needs 24,000 two-pound cans. I can under--- '
stand all these things finding their place : '
on a well-appointed mess table, but what-'
in the name of goodness do soldiers want
with 500 bottles of infants' food of a much

kinds runs up to over 10.000 pounds and
thousands of pipes are needed to smoke it
It must be remembered that these: flex- ;
ures represent only the minimum amount'
of each article required. The department
has power to double the quantity if it sees
fit. And as the army In the Philippines

Station D. If we -were earlier fhan tlia
inscribed minute of each box's announce
ment we would find trouble running after
us. The responsibility weighed Topsy
down to the cobbles. It kept his mas
ter's watch in his hand when a smoke
stack or a building struck out the Bight
of some lighted city cluck.
Dewey knows his district. He pulled
up at every box and he listened patiently
to the sound of the key in the lock, the
drop of the box. the soft noise of letters.
Even the rattling of the box into place
again never tricked him â it was not his
cue. But the snap of the spring lock
then he knew. And with the bleak.
obedient endurance of his class of pÂ«o
--ple he continued.
"Get-ap," said Mr. darkey. "He needs
the whip now, you see. If you should
drive the friskiest kind of horse over this
trip for about three nights you'd have to
whin him by that time. They get broke
inside a week. Topsy was a good horse
before he went Into the business, but he's
spoiled now. He's been at it most three
years, and ho never gets a night off ex
cept when 1 get my vacationâ fifteen days
every year.* He pulls eight hours a night
over these cobblestones and over the hills,
and it's broke him. He never used to
stumble, but sometimes he : goes down
with me now. If it rains and the streets
are slippery, he has a hard time to keep
up. The rest of the boys keep two horses
and change oft; they can't get .any that'll
THE SUNDAY CALL.
" Jhere Ain't Much Mail in 3t Jo-Might"
Btttnd working every night. Hut Topsy
stands it. When I first got him 1 thought
he wouldn't last a week, but he was bet
ter'n I thought. Those roar. a seem strong
er than other horses. He's about eight
years old and he's always worked hard. I
fuess. He used to work for a butcher
ut that wasn't so bad as thisâ not so
steady. But he's been at it 'bout long
enough now. and I'm going to let him
Btop. I'm going to take him over home to
Fruitvule and let him have a good time,
and I'll get a new horse when I start
work again."
Topsy's reward is to be that of the
scarred veteran. I took the opportunity
to tell him about his prospects the. next
time I was left alone with him. but I do
not think he understood. He turned his
unchecked head slowly, rheumatically,
and looked mo full in the face, but his
look was incredulous and only said: "Who
are you, taking possession of the United
States mall cart an<l talking nonsense to
me? Do you want to If ad me into a fools
paradise? Are you sane, to be talking
about fields that wax green and fat when
the new rama come, and idleness to
munch therein? No; my paths are the
aching paths that lead over bumpy cob
bles, and my cue 1? the click of a lock."
And as I thought upon a horse's
thoughts I could see notning in all his
mental outlook which might serve in the
place of man's greatest joyâ the joy of
nope. Topsy's good time is coming, but
he is deprived of the greater good time
Of anticipation, and even in the days when
he shall roam, cropping over luscious
fields across the, bay, will there not al
ways be ono anxious ear trembling for
the click? The pathos of animals that
cannot know ana ti.e pathos of the old
who move confused through a maddening
city's streets always hurt ma with the
same hurt.
Our way was straight and plain once we
reached Market street. It waÃ 6hort to
cQllect from the boxes oa the couth side
from Second street down, and there wai
the faintest flicker of enthusiasm In the
roan's pace, tie knew that the lights of
the ferry building ahead meant a brief re
cess from mail boxes. When we drove
under the left arch we were sharp on
time.
In the short time allowed for rest before
the long- trip should begin I followed for a
little way on their .shifting Journey the let
ters we had brought in trie blue and white
Back. I have a confused reconectlon of
seeing: them faced, stamped up, by dizzy-
Ing fingers, and their edges were
shoved even In a trough, and they were
fed. scores at a time, to a greedy, gasping
little machine that reached eager claws
out to seize them the raster. When I
next.saw them they were postmarKed and
their stamps canceled.
Beyond that I understood little, al
though there were polite people every
where who explained. The sorting for
city delivery impressed me as tedious and
I wondered how many of the trifling notes
we writeâ the acceptances and regrets and
I'm-ln-townsâ are worth the trouble they
make. But I saw Bundy and I shall not
forget him. Of all the wolves In sheep's
clothing I ever came across, Bundy Is the
wolflost wolf at heart with the guise of
the sheepiest sheep. His front door was
opened for me and I saw the workings of
him. and I learned hoy.- he tells tales.
Then his front door was closed again and
once more he stared down, without a sign
of malice aforethought in his bald, hypo
critical face. All he said was, "Quarter
to 8."
Below stairs we went to the waiting
Topsy and we found him surrounded by
the four other horses who do the four
other districts. The red carts stood hud
dled In the light of the broad entrance and
their drivers stood awaiting the only girl
who ever made the night round. I was
Introduced to their cordial welcome be
ginning with Cupid and ending with
londey; and, by my faith, they are &
merry lot. They work like men, as I
learned before we came upon t..e next
day, and there's not a man in the employ
of our Govemn.ent who better earns every
red penny that It pays him.
Cupid sank a blue cap afar down his
head, and what part of him was visible
behind his mustache looked mischievous.
I heard him mutter anxiously from be
hind It, "I hope Larkey's not going to
serve you the trick he served himself
onee â tip over on the hills."
Then the breezy voice of the good-look
ing extra Joined In: "These trips are
pretty dangerous after the city gets dark.
One of the hoys drove into a pile of lum
ber One nightâ didn't see it comin'. We
often have breakdowns. The road 9 are
bad places in the night."
And I forgave them all right generously
for their sinful intentions, for they had to
bear the disappointment of my not scal
ing worth a cep*-
The three of ua started first, for our
â way was long and Topsy's speed Is not
what it might be. The boys saw us off.
"Don't you think you'll got tired?"
"Better wrap that around you tighter."
"Can you keep awake till 2:30?"
"TVell| good luck to the trip."
The wind raced down Market street
that night arid we Urove straight in its
face. Topsy bent his head lower than
ever. The street was at its gayest, but
Topsy noticed nothing. He is sadly used
to it all. The terrified shriek of a flro
whistle did not startle him, and ha
glanced soberly at the hook and ladder
as it crashed onward toward him as if it
were part of the collecting business. The
hook and ladder turned an unexpected
corner and sprang, mad, upon us, and
Topsy Jogged gently in front of it, In time,
heaven knows how, to miss it.
"You won't find any part of the trip
much colder than this," Mr. I.arkey en
couraged. "The climate Is different over'n
the Mission." The swooping wings of the
air struck us. and the dnrk we were driv
ing into made it feel colder. Thera were
six hours still ahead.
There was no stop to be made until we
reached Twenty-fourth and Church
Ktroets. There we wore due to collect
from the first box at 9 o'clock. We were
on time, and ten minutes over, during
which wo grew warm and drowsy in th'j
corner drugstore. The drugstore made
outdoors much colder than before, and the
air that crept in, even above a three-Inch
collar, mad.- me bundle myself heavily.
In that far-away part of the town red
boxes are not near together. Once in a
long while there is one altogether empty
ana the few letters found are more vari
ous than :n the commercial district. Some
are addressed in ungainly foreign char
acters and some writings quiver with old
age and some are copper-plate labors on
pink or blue squares that bespeak ruled
note paper within.
Thpn of a sudden we came upon the
hills. Uncompromising clay under foot
boded ill for winter trips.' Topsy cast a
despairing glance ahead. I blushed wlt'a
Bhame at what I had blindly undertaken;
to H<ld one hundred and nine and one-half
pounds to his hack-breaking burden. I
was gladdened for the first time to think
of the half-pound I have diminished of
Iflte days.
The carrier Jumped from the cart. I
looked for a box at first and wondered
why Topsy had not halted. But as he
swung his firms for rÂ«'iiof and started
bravely up the hill beside his weary little
companion, I understood.
"It makes it easier for him when we
come to these hills." he said. And de
prrcatingly: "I don't mind any, it's a
change from rldin.' " It was said as If to
relieve Topsy's mind. It was like your
mother when she used, to tell you to take
the only help of currant Jelly leftâ she
really didn't care for currant Jelly. In
my eight hours of comradeship with Mr.
Larkey I came to the conclusion that he
is a good man if ever there was one. He
h;is rhe oi'en blue eye that Jack says
hasn't a cross word nor a headache in it.
The lines had he.>!i dropped long since,
and Topsy was left to zigzag the hills at
liis own discretion. I watched him turn
corners when they should be turned at
the guidance of naught but his own wise
head, ami I marveled. Among the 127
boxes collected between 6:30 p. m. of
Friday and 2:30 a. m. of Saturday he
never erred but once. That was when we
returned by way of St. Luke's Hospital.
There against the white wall and below
the shiny green terrace hangs a new red
box. The whole might be a page from a
JUSTIN M'CARTHY'S OPINION OF
GEORGE ELIOT.
It was thp Autocrat of the Breakfast
Table who had laid down the principle
that men, like peaches and pears, grow
sweet a little while before they decay. At
30, he explained, eager and ambitious
men are striving to carve a name for
themselves, but twenty years later they
have either succeeded or have shut up
their claspknife. Does this explain the
thoroughly optimistic tone of the "Remin
iscences" of Justin McCarthy, a man who
certainly may consider that he has suc
ceeded? Both England and American
critics are now engaged in poking more
or less funny fun at this eminent Irish
man for his roseate view of all his friends
and acquaintancesâ even those who op
posed him in religion, In politics and in
literature. I wonder If It is right for me
to Increase their hilarity by pointing out
one little discrepancy between the Justin
McCarthy of twenty-five years ago and
the Justin McCarthy of to-day?
Just about twenty-five years ago, In an
article contributed to the Galaxy, a once
famous New York magazine, Mr. McCar
thy made this hesitant allusion to the
physical characteristics of the lady who
called herself George Eliot: "Nature in
deed seemed to have given this Â«xtraor
Kate Greenaway .picture-book. When Mr.
-arkey attempted to drive Topsy to this
i.ew box the little roan attempted mild
lj to correct. "It he was going the
r ids by to-morrow night he'a know by
I time," he said. . :
inding back through the Mission was
a reary business. Qn-ce-.we came upon
t! only surprise that the world had left
fo Topsy â a .train above his head. It
snorted as we drew n.Â«ar the bridge and
started pompously across. Topsy knows
trains when they meet him face to face
on a level, but this-^it had never chanced
so before. It must, be some sort of
black monster waiting to spring. Ha
whimpered, a tfny whimper and shied
piteously. He will never wonder again.
Further along were streets that frowned
at those who [presumed to crash through
midnight stillness^ There were no lights
left by this time, save in saloons.' There
were no pedestrians, save policemen and
watchmen. There were no wagons at all.
"Good evening," said a formidable of
ficer after he had given us a lightning,
sketch of the suicide between the click
of the key and the snap of the lock. The
next policeman we met said "Good morn
ing."
It Was six long, cold hours sine* din
ner. 1 began to think tenderly of tha
::g dish.
"What iimÂ© do you hayÂ« supper?** I
ventured.
"After 2:"0. Sometimes I stop In for a
cup of coffee on the trip, but I don't often
do it. because I have hard work to make
up time when I do."
.t hours hard Journeying without
bite or sup for man or beast! Did I not
tell you they were two of the hardest
workers In San Francisco-?
"That's about the only thing I ever
complain of." he added. "If we could
have about half an hour at midnight to
pet something to eat we could stand the
work better. And we need one night off
k. The hours are hard. O' course,
v.c sleep late in the mornin'. but the day
sleep don't seem somehow like night
sleep."
The same story of the night hand every
where. Nature, crying out against the
madness of turning her night to day.
There Is fretfulness and feverlshnesa in
the morning sleep.
We darted between the scolding engines
of Townsend street and brought hack the
straggling little letters that are now and
then dropped the other g!dr of the
tracks. Along the wat<*r front we. found
that night was not yet done. Xlght never
is done down there until daylight takes a
hand in the matter. The. hours were so
wee and small by this time that most of
you never saw them at all as they scud
ded by. They are. the hours that helong
to mail carts and milk wagons; they are
the hours that are approprf- t*A by- sights
and sounds not pretty to see nor pleasant
to hear. Along the water front m.on
staggered, alone or against some fellow
staggerer's shoulder. On Market street
cabs were driven in the definite manner ;
that indicates an occupant. â¢
So much belonged to the end of night.
It was overlapped by the beginning of
'lay. One lono man and his white d"g
kept the wharf, while the man fish-ed for
breakfast. Up Sansome street filed a
stately, rumblirg procession of fruit waer
, ÂÂ«. "Those fellows drive In from Ocean
View, and sometimes they fa!! asleep like'
w<Â» do," Mr. Larkey said. "Lots o' : tfm<-s
I go to sleep between h"xes, and T
wouldn't know onoueh to.'wtueup .if the
horse didn't stop at the right place."
We rattled dov.ii Market street In thi
wake of Cupid and the Mascot, with"
Blonde? close upofin us. Tt was a. little
short of 2:30 when we rolled in the Ferry
station.
"So you stayed with him to the end?"
they greeted me with.
"Why, of course. Didn't you know that
I intended to?" I was. still able to smile.
"Intended toâ yes -butâ"
"The boys all had it up that you'd tr^t
tired out before 12 and take a car
home," my guide explained.
The lighted carts wheeled about
and formed in line to depart. Their red
paint and the blue of the drivers shone
under the electric light, and they looked
like a line of circus charioteers.
"Glad you happened on the best
weather we've had."
"Next time you ride crac with me;
there's the most to see on my route."
"Next time you come you can rlda in
one of the new wagons."
Then it was off and away and men
slept. KATHRYN MARCH.
<Jlnary woman an the gifts a woman could

he considered a piece â â  of gossiping per
sonality if I allude to a fact which must,
some day or other, be part of literary his
tory. Mrs. Lewe.s ia not beautiful.- In her
appearance there is nothing whatever to
attract admiration. Hers, is not even a
face like that of . Charlotte Custaman,
which at least must make a deep impres
sion and seize at once the attention of the
gazer; nor does it seem like. that of Mme.
de- Btael or Elizabeth Barrett Browning,
informed and illuminated by the light of
genius. Mrs. Lewes is what we in Eng
land call decidedly plain,- what .people .in
New York call homely,- and what persons
who did not care to soften the force of an
unpleasant truth would describe probably
by a still harder and more emphatic ad
jective." "-'â â¢â -' â¢ â  ' ,: â¢
Now mark how the Justin McCarthy of
to-day speaks of the .same lady. In the
eighteenth chapter of his . "Reminis

who reads books and Is interested in great
authors is acquainted with tire features
and lineaments of George Eliotâ that' long,'
pale, colorless face, with its clearly cut
outlinesâ face not beautiful, indeed;- but
full of that intellectual . expressiveness
which appeal? toje.y.gry mind and heart."
