THREE BOER COLUMNS ARE
ADVANCING ON LADYSMITH
British Troops Under General White
F^eceiving Reinforcements for the
Coming Big Battle, Wfyd) Is Ex
pected to Begin on Sunday.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27â A special to the Journal from Cape Town says: The meeting of the British
and Boers in decisive battle will probably come Sunday. The battleground will be in British
territory, and the Boers will be the attacking force. Three columns of Boers are now advancing
upon Ladysmith. One column of the Transvaal soldiers under General Joubert is descending from
Glencoe by Waschbank* Wessels Nek and Elands Laagte, and a second column, also of the Trans
vaal troops, is moving southward from Dundee, taking the road by which General Yule escaped in
the night.
The first column is at Wessels Nek, only five miles north of Elands Laagte. The second col
umn, after taking provisions from stores at Dundee, advanced to Beith and looted the stores at
that place, but used no violence against any person. These two columns may join. They are ap
proaching Ladysmith from the northeast.
The third column, composed of Orange Free State men, is moving along the Harrismith
road, pointing at Ladysmith from the northwest. This force has passed Besters and Walkers
Hoch Station. and is within ten miles of Ladysmith.
The purpose evidently is to close in upon Ladysmith fromthe north, and, though no direct
information of any line of communication between the Transvaal columns and the Orange Free
State column is contained in messages received here from correspondents at the front, yet the
precision of the movements of the Boer forces indicates that one head is directing the advance of
the three columns.
Scouts report that General Joubert is unexpectedly strong in artillery. While the Boers are
pushing forward to attack, General White is receiving reinforcements from Durban and Pietermar
itzburg. His force at Ladysmith is now about 15,000 men, including the men of General Yule's
command that retired from Dundee.
The British wounded left at Dundee by General Yule when he withdrew in haste are reported
as receiving good care from the Boers, whose surgeons are attending them.
BOER LOSSES
AT GLENCOE UP
IN THOUSANDS
LONDON, Oct. 27.â The war situation
this morning presents no new features.
It is presumed in Natal that the Boers
are reconstructing their plans and that
the English are resting, but telegrams
from Ladysmith at express rates still oc
cupy forty-eight hours in transmission to
London, and therefore It Is not Impossible
that something. is happening.
One special dispatch asserts that Colonel
Baden-Powell, the British commander at
Mafeklng. is aware that Pretoria has
given General Cronje orders to stay his
hand, as already there is quite enough to
employ the Boers in Natal.
The Government has chartered the City
of Rome as a hospital ship.
According to the latest account of the
first battle at Glencoe. the Boer army
amounted to 7000 men and about noon an
other army, almost as large, under Com
mander General Joubert, advanced within
6000 yards of Glencoe camp and then re
tired. The Boer losses were very heavy,
fully 3000. _
BELATED STORIES
OF THE GLENCOE
AND OTHER FIGHTS
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 26.â (Delayed In
transmission. Two telegrams dated
Lourenzo Marquez, October 23, have been
received here, and In view of the fact that
all Pretoria news is now coming via I^ur
enzo Marquez, the authorities are in
clined to believe they are copies of of
ficial bulletins from Pretoria, The first
evidently refers to the Glencoe battle,
and says:
"General Erasmus, as reported, -was
compelled to retire, his men and horses
beini? exhausted. General Erasmus ap
pears to have been decoyed in the wrong
direction by the enemy and the British
Buc-eeded In repulsing the Utrecht arid
Vryheld forces. The number of killed is
unknown, but the burghers suffered heav
ily." A.,:
The second telegram bears evidence of
being a report of the same engagement
by Commandant Trichard. . It says:
"The Ermelo burghers, In charge of the
artillery, apparently fled from Dundee.
They were reinforced by Pretoria burgh
ers under General Erasmus. The English
opened a sharp fire and De Jaeger, with a
Krupp, yielfjed. Our wounded were nu
merous, Including Commandant Grebelcr.
We also lost 243 prisoners."
The story of the retreat from Glencoe
and Dundee shows the British were forced
to move their ramp twice in order to get
out of the range of the excellent Boer
practice. Just as they had decided to

evacuate the second camp a shell killed
two soldiers.
"When General Yule heard of the battle
i of Elands Laagte he sent a squad of Hus
i sars, under Colonel Knox. and a battery '
j of artillery to intercept the Boers at Big- i
j garsberg. The artillery succeeded in |
â  shelling the Boers as they were retreating '
; over the Umpati Mountains, killing and |
i wounding many, but the artillerymen 'â 
were forced to retire by the rtflÂ« firÂ« of
I the enemy.
It appears that the Boers shelled the
' camp all day long Sunday and the Brit
! !sh were kept busy skirmishing and re- J
moving their transport wagons out of {
range. During the retreat there were I
many anxious moments Monday night, |
when the British marched through van I
Lqndeer's Pass, six miles long, across to !
Biggarsben?. The troops got through I
the dangerous defile, which fifty men
could easily have held, at 3 o'clock Tues- j
day morning.
LONDON, Oct. 27.â A dispatch from
i Utrecht, Transvaal, says: "The fighting at
! Glencoe lasted nine hours. The burgh-
I ers say that they never witnessed such a
| fight. General Lucius Meyer's force of
COOO men, with eight, six-inch guns, was
several times repulsed."
Belated reports from Tuli Fort partially
elucidate the situation on the Rhodesia!!
border. It appears that Colonel Plummer
ascertained that all the Zoutpansberg !
Boers, numbering 700 men, mustered un
der Piet Joubert at the Black River and
proceeded to Limpopo River, where they
arrived October 16. accompanied by a
number of armed Shangaan and Zout
panÃberg Kaffirs, whom they had mm
i pelled to take up arms. The British
j troopers thereupon captured three Kaf
| fir chiefs, who are now held as hostages
: for the good behavior of their tribes.
On October 19, reconnoitring patrols
proceeding aJong the north bank of the
river in a westerly direction, suddenly
encountered a party of Boers in some
dense bush on the Rhodesia side of the J
Limpopo. The patrols retreated and the j
Boers fired, wounding a trooper. Bubse-
I quently Captain Glinne. with a patrol,
i left Tuli with the object of locating the
Boer force.
â  On October 21 a strong Boer patrol was ;
encountered at Rhodes Drift In thick
bush. A sharp skirmish was the result, i
.Two of the British were killed and two i
wounded. The Boers had seven men
killed and many wounded. The Boers re
tired to a strong position on a kopje, at
Ponts Drift. Major Pilsen, with an am
\ bulance, proceeded to fetch the dead and
I wounded, and while placing the bodies on
1 a cart, the Boers opened lire, killing two
horses, but In spite of the sharpshooting
the British succeeded in carrying away
their comrades.
The latest dispatch from Tuli, dated
: October 24, says: "A Boer patrol crossed
I the river ten miles above Rhodes Drift
twice recently, carrying native women i
and children. They shot and looted."

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1899.
"THIS IS NO
LITTLE WAR" SAYS
LORD ROSEBERY
LONDON. Oct. Lord Rnsebery in
a speech at a private dinner of politicians
Wednesday, referred to the war and the
heavy. -loss of lite, saying tint -: they --toed
to deplore the death of General Symona,
and before they sheathed the sword there
would be many more such losses. Mean
while,* he added, the country ought to
present a united front to the enemy." 'In
his opinion the Transvaal was not a very
complicated question, but merely the ef
fort of a community to put back the
clock. Referring to Majuba Hill Lord
Rosebery raid Mr. Gladstone's action was
determined by the belief that the power
of Great Britain was so great that she
could afford to do things other nations
could not afford to do without risk. The
Boers regarded Mr. Gladstone's magnan
imity as a proof of weakness upon which
they could encroach.
Dwelling on the unfriendliness of the
foreign press and foreign public opinion,
Lord Rosehery said:.
"This is no little "war. There are na
tions watching with eagerness every trip,
every stumble, and, much more, every
catastrophe and disaster that may over
take our arms. War waged under these
conditions, therefore, Is not a little war.
I do not know why we should attract
=uHi 111-feeling. There is one simple test
that will apply to the British empire as
compared with other empires which watch
her with so much, I won't say malevo
lence, but candid feeling. We would be
only too glad at the presfMit moment to
strike a bargain with the rest of the
world that every frontier should â¢ remain
as now. Of what other empire can that
be said? Yet we, who are not trying to
grain, but to maintain an empire; we who,
In the best and highest sense, are the
most conservative force In the world, are
the objects of the concealed dislikes of
Governments who, I think, are less single
minded than ourselves."
Lord Roscbery, in an impnssioned pero
ration calling upon the nation to main
tain a united front, after speaking of
Great Britain as "this lonely island in
these northern seas, viewed with such
Jealousy, such hostility, such jarred am
bition by the great empires of the world,
who count their armies with embattled
millions," . concluded amid stormy ap
plause with Shakespeare's words,
"Naught shall make us rue
If England to herself remain but true."
"BOER SPENDER" BEATEN.
I/iNDON, Oct. 27.â The Parliamentary
bye-election for the Bow and Bromley
division of Tower Hamlets, London, held
to-day to replace the Hon. Lionel R. Hol
land, Conservative, was fought on the
Government's Transvaal policy and re
sulted In a big Victory for the Govern
ment, the Conservative candidate. Wil
liam Guthrie, being elected. The Con
servative majority was practically twice
that Becured at the election of Mr. Hol
lajid.
Through the campaign Mr. Spender op
posed the war In South Africa and Mr.
Chamberlain's conduct of the negotiations
with the Transvaal Government. Hi* op
position was so persistent that ho was
dubbed by the Conservatives throughout
the canvass as "Boer Spender." His elec-.
tion literature denounced Tory patriotism
as "Invoking the slaughter of British
â¢workmen for the German millionaires on
the Rand." and declared that orders for
clothing and blankets were given by the
Government to German concerns and not
to British. Mr. Guthrte, moreover, was
accused by Mr. Spender of being a mem
ber of the board of directors of an insur
ance company which had raised the pre
miums on policies of officers going to thÂ°
war, while he pointed out that no Ameri
can insurance company had Increased
Dremlums durlrrg the Spanish-American
war.
The constituency, which Is mainly of
the working classes, nevertheless plumped
for "Chamberlain and war."

DETAILS OF
THE FIGHTING
AT KIMBERLEY
English Stories of the Rout of
Boers and Killing of Com
mandant Botha.
I
LONDON, Oct. 27.â During the mo
mentary lull in the fight'ng In Na
tal cornea news from the western
border which temporarily shifts
the scene of chief interest to the
beleaguered British force at Klmberley.
The sharp struggle there Tuesday appearfa
to have been the result of a sortie, with
the view of breaking the cordon surround
ing the place. The British, apparently 500
strong, met 700 Boers, and according to
the official and other accounts routed
them after severe righting, in which the
armored trains appear to have done val
uable service. The Boers were intrenched
strongly seven miles northward, and the
British brilliantly carried the enemy's
position without serious loss. It Is said
that the .Boers twice unfairly used a
white flag.
Botha, who was among the killed, was
a member of the Volksrnud and a famous
Dutch fighter. He distinguished himself
as a marksman at Brenkhoratspruit when
the Ninety-fourth British Regiment was
mowed down. He afterward defended a
farmhouse against the British. When he
surrendered the farmhouse Botha was
found, with five wounds, bathed In blood.
A special dispatch from Cape Town to
day gives details of the defeat of 700
Boers by the British at Riverton, north
of Kimberley, Wednesday, In which the
enemy was completely routed with heavy
loss, the British loss being three men
killed and twenty men, including: two of
ficers, wounded. This is probably the.
same fight, though a different date is
given, as referred to In the ('ape Town
dispatch of yesterday in which it was
said that official reports from Kimberley
Tuesday announced that Colonel Soott-
TiiVner, with 270 men, had an engagement
with the Boers, during which a detach
ment of 150 men of the Lancashire Regi
ment distinguished itself and the armored
trains did good service. The Boers were
unable to withstand the splendid charge
of the Lancashlres, who cleared the hill
occupied by the enemy at the point of
the bayonet.
The Boer losses are described as very
heavy. Colonel Scott-Turner's force con
sisted of the local volunteers, who with
the Lancashires completed the rout of the
burghers after the artillery had driven
them out of their Intrenchments. Botha

BRAVE BOERS DIED
TO SAVE COMRADES
DURBAN, Natal, Oct. 27.â fin interesting incident
in connection with the Elands Laagte fight is report
ed here. When the fire of the British guns became
too hot, eight Boers ran forward, out of cover, and,
standing together, coolly opened fire at the Imperial
Light Horse, with the evident purpose of drawing

commanded the Bashof force. The fight
lasted four hours.
Before the British sortie Kimberley was
apparently In high spirits, as a dispatch
fiom there dated October 23 says every
ore was cheerful, there at that time and
that a wedding was celebrated there that
day. The dispatch adds:
"Great enthusiasm has been aroused
here by the news of the British success
in Natal. Several farmers In the neigh
borhood of Kimberiey have been noticed
In the ranks of the Boers. A letter from
Father Rorke said 600 Boers with 100
wagons were laagered at Taungs. All the
whites have left except the women, who
sought refuge in the convent. The Boer
commandant has promised to protect
them."
The news from the northern border in
dicates that the Boers are actively .ry
ing to prevent Colonel Plummer from re
lieving Mafeking, whence the absence of
news since Pretoria announced the bom
bardment of the place is creating consid
erable alarm.
TWO CHIEFS THREATENED.
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 27 âA telegram from
Buluwayo. Rhodesia, dated Monday, says:
"A Boer force is threatening Chief
Khama and Chief Linchwei, who are loyal
to Great Britain. The two chiefs' coun
try lies at the extreme northwest of the
Transvaal and Includes Bechuanaland. It
seems a gross mistake for the Boers to
provoke war among the natives. The
probable explanation is that ths Boer
force intends to destroy the railway to
Buluwayo, which runs through Khama's
country, and thereby prevent a movement
by Colonel Plummer's Rhodeslan force to
go to the relief of Mafeking. Already
there have been stories of a Rhodeslan
armored train engaging the Boers some
distance north of Mafeking."
BERESFORD OPPOSES ROSEBERY
LONDON. Oct. 27â Rear Arlmir.il
Charles Heresford, speaking at Glasgow
to-day against Lord Rosebery's candidacy
for the rectorship of the university, said
he admired the Earl's character and bril
liancy, but opposed him as a politician.
The speaker charged Lord Rosebcry with
following instead of leading public opin
ion and asserted that he was largely re
sponsible for the Transvaal resistance and
the present war, because he had remained
silent until wax had actually begun, and
the Transvaal has interpreted his silence
as meaning that the country was divided
on the Issue.
SCHIEL HAS A RECORD.
LONDON, Oct. 27.â The Cape Town cor
respondent of the Daily Telegraph says
he learns that Colonel Schiel, the wound
ed and captured commander of the Ger
man contingent of the Boer forces, is the
same Individual who acted as Cet way's

Mails for Refugees.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 27.-The British
Government has reported to the United
States that large numbers of people from
the South African Republic and from- the
Orange Free State have flocked Into Cape
Oolony'and Natal for temporary residence
during the war and that every -effort will
be made to deliver their malls. The Brit
ish authorities suggest that if this coun
try puts into the. British mail letters and
packages addressed to persons in the
Transvaal or the Orange Republic the
Cape Colony office will try to deliver them
to such as are found there or in Natal.
It. is assumed from this that the British
have a list of refugees from the Boer
country- Mails to be delivered by this
means must be indorsed by the senders

GOVERNMENT'S
WAR POLICY
IS ATTACKED
But the British Parliament Passes
the Appropriation Bill and Re
ceives Queen's Thanks.
LONDON. Oct. 27.â The third reading
of the appropriation bill in the
House of Commons to-day gave the
opportunity for further attacks on
the Government's war policy. Gavin
Brown Clark, Radical, formerly Consul
General of the Transvaal, accused the
Secretary of State for . the Colonies. Mr.
Chamberlain, of publishing- an emascu
lated version of the Boer franchise bill
passed by the Volksraad.
Mr. Chamberlain tartly repudiated this.
He said the bill was published exactly as
received from Secretary of State Reitz.
Thomas Gibson Bowles, Conservative
member for Lynn Regis, referred to the
heavy military' task before the Govern
ment and said he feared the foreign pow
ers would take advantage of Great Brit
ain's difficulties to make an attempt upon
her possessions. . All the great powers ex
cept Austria, he asserted, hated Great
Britain.
Lloyd Georg<\ Radical member for the
Carnarvon District, declared the offers of
the Transvaal had been misrepresented,
whereupon Mr. Chamberlain jumped up
and protested, and the Speaker, William
Court Gully, intervened.
Lloyd George then withdrew his ex
pression regarding misrepresentation.
The House of Commons passed the ap
propriation bill, after which the measure
was taken to the House of Lords and'
passed through all the stagf-s.
The session was then suspended until 2

CASTRO GOVERNMENT
NOT YET RECOGNIZED
GENERAL CIPRIANO CASTRO.
/â^ ARACAS, Venezuela, Oot. 27.â The foreign Ministers met yesterday at the
American Legation and decided not to recognize the ' Castro Government
without Instructions from their respective Governments. President An
j drade has cabled from Barbadoes, where he arrived recently, to the com-
mander at Puerto Cabello, ordering him to defend the city against Castro
to the last extremity.
Coro and Maraoaibo have surrendered to General Castro. Order reigns her*.
General Clprlano Castro, the new President of Venezuela, Is only 36 years old,
but he has been in politics for a lons time. He was always one of the warmest
supporters of the Liberal party and took part in the war of defense during the
revolution that was lod by Crespo. That general d}d all he could to influence
Castro to his side, and even offered him a portfolio, but Castro could not be
persuaded to take it. The reverse, Indeed, was the fact, for Castro severely
criticised Creapo's administration. When Andrade's star began to rise Castro led
a movement ac-sunst him and CreSQO. After the failure of the "Mocho" Hernan
dez revolution the man who is now Prvfident successively defeated Morales and
Larrla and became the dominant military power in the country. With his new
success came hordes of followers, and Castro, after carrying numerous, towns, at
k the capital ltsplf. President Castro is a highly educated young man and
a "hard worker, but he is hampered by that explosiveness of character that is the
greatest handicap to the Latin race.
bo many gallant officers and soldiers have
fallen in the performance of their duty.
"Gentlemen of the House of Commons,
I acknowledge with gratitude the liberal
provisions you have made to repay the
expenses of the military operations in

CANNOT FORCE A TOWN
TO GRANT A LICENSE
Judge Buckles Benders an Important '
Decision in the Vieira License
Case.
SUISUN, Oct. 27.â Judge Buckles has j
' rendered *n important decision regarding j
ordinances governing the issuance of j
liquor licenses in municipal corporations '
of the sixth class. Joseph Vieira is a res-
Ident of Rio Vista and asked the court to
grant him a writ to command the Town
Clerk and Town Marshal to issue to him a
license to sell spirituous, malt or ferment- ;
ed liquors within said town in lesa quan- ;
titles than one pint. The officers r.efuFod ;
t" grar.t the license, as the petitioner had \
not complied with a certain town ordi
nance, which required any person desir
ous of conducting a saloon to present a
petition to the Board of Town Trustees
pig-ned by twelve resident freeholders re-
Biding upon the street on which the saloon
Is proposed to be opened.
Vieira made no effort to comply with
the ordinance. There were not twelve
resident freeholders residing upon the
Etreet. Vieira claimed this portion of the
ordinance was unreasonable and oppress
ive and void.
Judge Buckles said: "Our courts have
1 : i m effect that the sale of intoxicating
liquors is not to be classed as the sale of
Useful and beneficial commodities, but that
their sale may be prohibited. Rio Vista
could by ordinance prohibit the sale of in
toxicating liquors within the corporate
limits of the town. There is no inherent
right in any citizen to sell liquor by re
tall. The petitioner was not entitled to
the writ rued for and a demurrer against
the same is sustained."

TESTS OF MARCONI'S
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
Navy Department Officials Securing Ample
Proof of the Wonderful Work of
the System.
NEW YORK. Oct. JT.â Tho Navy Department continued its test of the Marconi system of wireless telegraphy to-day.
The demonstrations aro bein* madÂ© on the flagship New York and the battleship Massachusetts, in the North River,
off tho foot of Thirty-fourth atreat. The ships lay US yards apart and the demonstration was one of speed and ac
curacy. Code messages, uÂ«!ng both the navy and the international Morse codes, were sent, besides numbers and let
ters selected at random. The largest continuous message wan a newspaper article of 200 words. In all, there were
six demonstrations and the work continued with intervals of preparation for about two hours.
Slgnor Marconi said he paid no attention to the apeed attained, aa the Navy Department waa more particular as to
the accuracy.
The equipment overhead consisted only of wires strung from the crossbeams o,f both vessels. On the New York tho ap
paratus was In the after gun room, and here Slgnor Maroonl did his work. On the Massachusetts the receiving and sending
was donÂ© in the captain's office, where one of Marconl'B assistants was stationed. The clicking of the Instruments is vibrant
and could bÂ« heard throughout either ship.
Of the Naval Board which supervised the tests, Lieutenant Commander Newton and Lieutenant Hill watched the work
on the flagship and Lieutenant Bllsh was on the Massachusetts. When the tests were concluded they held a conference on
the New York and compared notes. They will make a final report to the Chief of the Bureau of Equipment of the Navy De
portment.
It is expected that on Monday the New York and Massachusetts will cruise off Sandy Hook In order to make a long
distance test of the system. They may be away from the anchorage for several days. At times the vessels will be forty
miles from each other and this will be the crucial demonstration. If successful, it will prove how valuable the system would
be during a naval engagement or while a fleet Is blockading an enemy's coast. During tho long-distance tests the great guns
of the warships will be discharged as a further test.
None of the members of the Naval Board would give an opinion of the work done by Signor Marconi. Admiral Farquhar
watched the demonstrations for a time and Beemed greatly interested.

SLAIN IN BATTLE
Filipinos Driven From
Trenches.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
MANILA, Oct. 23.â General Young's
column, which started yesterday morning
for Cabanatuan, seventeentmilesi north of
San Isidro, drove a force of rebels from
the trenches near Tuboatln River and
compelled them to retreat across that
stream. The fighting for a time was
brisk. The Americans lost two killed
and one wounded. Owing to the swift
current of the river, which is also very
deep, it was impossible to pursue the
enemy.
WASHINGTON", Oct. 27.â News was re
ceived at the War Department to-day of
the arrival of the hospital ship Relief at
Manila. She reported the disappearance
at sea between Guam and Manila of Lieu
tenant Robert D. Carmody, who went to
Guam with the Marine Battalion on the
Yusemlte, when Captain Leary was sent
out as Governor to take possession of the
island.
There are no details of the occurrence.
It appears that Lieutenant Carmody was
taken aboard at Guam, presumably sick,
and on orders home or else on a furlough.
It is thought possible that he may have
jumped overboard while delirious.
The War Department has received the
following from General Otis:
"The insurgent government submitted
application to send five commissioners to
Manila to arrange difficulties attending
the release of Spanish sick prisoners and
discuss peace conditions. It was declined.
No negotiations are necessary, as we
would gladly receive all Spanish prisoners
at our lines, welcome them from their
cruel captivity, and labor for their wel
fare. Correspondence by mail."
The Cabinet meeting lasted two hours
and a half, an hour longer than usual.
After the adjournment the members were
unusually reticent. -One member said the
President had cautioned them against
making any statement about the meeting
to-day. It can be stated, however, that
the discussion related to the Philippines,
and there is reason to believe that it was
in reference to military and naval plans,
which are to be placed in operation soon.
CRUISER DETROIT WILL

WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â The State De

pend a man-of-war to Colombian waters,
and the Detroit will be ordered to proceed
either to Cartagena or Colon, probably
the former, which is the sea terminus of
the railroad connecting Cartagena and
Calamar. upon the Magdalena River.
This railroad was built and is owned
and operated by Bostnn and New York
capitalists. Private letters say the prop
erty is in danger on account of the insur
rection and that it would be advisable to
order, a war vessel to Cartagena to pro
vide necessary protection.
Consul General Gudger, at Panama,, re
ports that many arrests of liberals are
being made in' that city. Unrest prevails,
he adds, but no open discord. The Mar
blehead will soon be in cable communica
tion with the department and she will be
sent to Panama to guard that terminus
of the Trans-lKthmian railroad and the
Detroit will be used to protect American
Interests at Colon, as well as the road to
Cartagena.
JUDGMENT IN FAVOR
OF J. A. ROBERTSON
The American Capitalist Wins His
Suit Against Bondholders of
a Mexican Railway.
MONTEREY. Mexico. Oct. 27.â J. A.
Robertson, an American capitalist of
Monterey, formerly receiver of the Mon
terey and Mexican Gulf Railroad Com
pany, haa received official notice that
the higher Federal Court in the City of
Mexico has affirmed the decisions of the
lower courts awarding him a Judgment
of 5450,000 in gold against the Belgian
bondholders of the road, who are now op
erating the property. This large judg
ment is for money advanced and other
services performed in behalf of the com
pany by Mr. Robertson.
Mr. Robertson was the promoter of the
Syndicate of American capitalists- which
was recently organized in the United
States with a capital of $7,000,000 for the
purpose of dealing in Mexican railways
and mining properties. This syndicate
has already purchased the Monterey Min
eral Belt Railway and the rich San Pedro
mines, the latter being located near Mon
terey.

GENERAL RIVIERA
â¢
Clash of Officials at
Havana.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Oct. 27.â General Rios Riv
iera, former Civil Governor of the prov
ince of Havana, whose withdrawal from
the Governorship was cabled last evening
as a resignation, denies that he has re
signed. He says he was dismissed and
that he does not know upon what grounds
the dismissal was ordered. He admits
that he recently remarked that he would
resign in the event that at least one out
of three nominations he had made to pub-
lie office was not approved, but he at
tributes his dismissal to the direct influ
ence of Senor Domingo Mendoz Capote,
Secretary of State In the Advisory Cab
inet of Governor General Brooke.
General Brooke, according to General
j Riviera, sent for the latter's resignation,
; which was refused.
Governor General Brooke, when ap
! proached regarding the matter to-day,
i said he preferred that any explanation
should be made by General Riviera hlm
i self. Senor Capote asserts that he re
j quested General xtiviera to resign because
: he was an obstructionist and out of har
mony with the administration, and that
General Riviera replied that he would
wait until he was dismissed, which was
decided upon immediately. There was no
objection, according to the Secretary of
State, to General Riviera holding certain
views as a private individual, but as a
i subordinate it was the duty of General
Riviera to carry out instructions and not
: to make himself an obstacle. There was
no other way to solve the problem, said
Senor Capote.
La Lucna.j. referring to the dismissal,
says: "The stole cause T*as the refusal or
General Riviera to allow cock-fighting, his
course in this respect -being contrary to a
previous order emanating from Senor Ca
i pote permitting It."
La Diseuslon says: "The occurrence
â  shows the lamentable lack of harmony
between prominent Cubans occupying
leading positions. The Government must
! have had exceptlon.il reasons for dlsmiss-
I Ing such a prominent man." .

MASON'S RESIGNATION
A POLITICAL MOVE
Many Important Changes Will Be
Made if He Carries Out
His Threat.
CHICAGO, Oct. 27.â The Herald will say
to-morrow: "Senator William E. Mason's
threat to resign unless the administra
tion's present foreign policy is changed,
according to the latest prophecy, may be
executed before Christmas. Persons who
assume to bo well informed insist that he
will step out immediately in pursuance
of an arrangement which will change the
whole face of Republican politics in Il
linois. The story, as widely circulated
yesterday, runs to this effect:
"Senator Mason will resign in a few
weeks to take a high-salaried legal posi
tionâsl2,ooo or more a yearâ with one of
the biggest corporations In the country,
having headquarters in Chicago. Governor
Tanner will then resign and Lieutenant
Governor Northcott, on succeeding to the
Governorship, will appoint Tanner to the
vacant Senatorship. With Tanner thus
eliminated from the gubernatorial situa
tion, Northcott can be made the "organi
zation" candidate for Governor next year.
The interests which are alleged to be
making Senator Mason their attorney at a
big salary, with a long term contract,
are interests which have a friendly feeling
for Governor Tanner's future."

R. J. Murphy, Acting Warden pending

not to hang Winters.

FLORENCE MARRYAT, THE
NOVELIST, PASSES AWAY
THE LATE FLORENCE MARRYAT.
LONDON, Oct. 27.â Florence Marryat (Mrs. Francis Lean), the well-known
authoress, died In London this morning.
Florence Marryat, the noted novelist, inherited her genius for literature
from her distinguished father, the late Captain Frederick Marryat of the
British navy- In her childhood Mis 9 Marryat was by no means happy, and
her unfortunate surroundings left a brand of melancholy upon her spirit which
never left her. Her father showed little affection for Florence and her sister.
It was his custom to place the two tots on the high mantel of his dining-room
while he and his friends feasted. Florence Marryat had a remarkable success as
a writer of stories, and. surpassed her father in financial returns from her
literary labors. She not only excelled as a romancer, but won high praise as a
singer and an actress. She was caught in the wave of spiritualism that over
swept London and the fruits of her thought on this subject are found in her
books "There Is No Death," "The Risen Dead" and "Spirit World." Her
stories have been rendered into half the languages of civilzation.
Miss Marryat married first Colonel Ross Church and then Colonel Francis
Lean. Among her works are: "Too Good for Him" (new edition, 1868),
"Woman Against Woman" (1865), "Confessions of Gerald Estcourt" (1865),
"Veronique" (1869), "Fighting the Air" (new edition, 1R78), "A Daughter of tha
Tropics" (1887). She also published "Life and Letters of Captain Marryat," two
volumes, in 1872.

time, It is believed, a new Warden will
have been installed at the Folsom prison.
MERELY A CONSOLIDATION.
NEW YORK, Oct. 2T.â ln view of con
flicting atatements and various conclu
sions as to the primacy of either company
in the recent Pullman-Wagner merger
the exact conditions are stated as fol
lows:
Neither the Pullman company has ab
sorbed the Wagner nor the Wagner com
pany has absorbed the Pullman. The
two companies have simply amalgamated, j
retaining the Pullman organisation, how
riably tend to produce a habit of
body requiring constantly augmented
doses.
The excellence of Syrup of Figs is due
not only to the originality and simplic-
ity of the combination, but also to the
care and skill with which It is manu-
factured by scientific processes known
only to the California Fig Syrup Co..
and therefore we wish to impress on all
the importance of accepting the true
and original remedy only. When buy-
ing note the full name of the company
âCalifornia Fig Syrup Co.â printed on
the front of every package.
In the process of manufacturing the
pleasant family laxative made by the
California Fig Syrup Co., and named
Syrup of Figs, figs are used, as they
ever, in preference to the Wagner, as the
Pullman is a stock company and tha
Wagner merely a business association
with no charter. The Wagner company
has four directors in the new Pullman
company and although the new jompany
may have the name of Pullman It will ls
equally as much Wagner as Pullman and
â will operate tin all the Vanderbilt lines.

are pleasant to the taste: but the me-
dicinal properties of the remedy are
obtained from an excellent combina-
tion of plants known to be medici-
nally laxative and to act most
beneficially.
As the true and original remedy
named Syrup of Figs is manufactured
by the California Fig Syrup Co. only, a
knowledge of that fact will assist in
avoiding the worthless imitations man-
ufactured by other parties. The high
standing of the California Fig Syrup

the satisfaction which the genuine
Syrup of Figs has given to millions of

that national questions have no place in

Metropolitan Temple to-night they will

not entertain that narrow view of the
contest. Yesterday at the Risdon Iron
Works Phelan said to the men there em
ployed: "There are no national issues in
volved in this contest. Next year you can
wave the starry flag."
The workingmen of San Francisco will
not ask Mayor Phelan's permission to
wave the starry banner in this year's j
tight for good government, clean politics
and patriotic principles. The Republi
can orators will bring out the starry flag |
to-night and the people will rally around j
Phelan -and the place-hunters under his |
banner are very much alarmed at the
suggestion that workingmen shall "wave
the starry flag" in a local contest. The j
plain fact is that the convention which
put out the ticket tnat Phelan heads was
not permitted by McNab and Phelan to
make a declaration of principles. The
game at that time was to catch Republi- â 
can votes on a non-p;iriisan basis and
fool Democrats by a general hurrah.. It
is now obvious to the Committee of One
Hundred that the Republicans cannot be j
used to advance Phelan's ambition, and
that the free silver Democrats â  are dis
gusted. Having no American principles
to advocate Phelan is forced to make a
bogging canvass and suggest that the flag
be put out of sight. Yesterday at the I
K'sdon Iron Works be also said to the j
men: "The Republican party will undo !
all our work: It is not in favor of prog- j

the Mayor will do what he has promised."

ENTHUSIASM FOR DAVIS IN
THE THIRTY-NINTH DISTRICT
Prolonged cheers and repeated applause
greeted every mention of Horace Davis'
name at the Republican rally held in
Saratoga Hall last night. The meeting
was enthusiastic from start to finish, and
the large hall was packed with voters.
The rallyâ and It was a rallyâ was held
under the auspices of the Thirty-ninth
District Republican Club, the Continental
League and the Horace Davis Club of the
Thirty-ninth District.
Frank D. Worth, president of the Con
tinental League, presided. After a few
words of welcome and a statement of the
purposes of the meeting, he introduced
L. G. Carpenter, candidate for Police
Judge. Before mentioning his own fight
Mr. Carpenter spoke of the merits of the
Republican candidate for Mayor. When
he concluded he received most hearty ap
plause. Following Carpenter came Major
Charles Boxton, Charles Bliss, Judge
Joachimsen, Asa R. Wells and Charles
Jackson, whose remark were warmly ap
plauded by the audience.
When this relay of candidates had come
and gone the Knickerbocker Quartet and
the band prepared the audience for the
next batch of speakers. Colonel T. V.
Eddy, Major Kyle. E. Myron Wolf and L.
A. Gibbons spoke of the campaign issues
and the merits of the candidates. Not a
word was lost by the absorbed audience
and frequently the speakers had to wait
for the applause to subside. â 
One gf the last speakers of the evening
was Horace Davis, and his reception was
of- the Intensely enthusiastic kind. By
many of the candidates the principles of
the charter were expounded and the posi
tion of the Republican party in relation
to It was treated at length. Altogether
the meeting was a splendid success and
the citizens of the Thirty-ninth left the
hall confident of victory for the Repub
lican ticket at the polls on November f.

ORGANIZED A STRONG DAVIS
CLUB IN THE FORTY-FIRST
One of the strongest Republican clubs
of the campaign has been organised in
the Forty-first Assembly District unuer
the name of the Young Men's Horace Da
vis Club.
The club has among its members a
large number of yountr business men of
the city who for the first time have taken
active Interest in politics. Every block
in the 'arge district has its representa
tive, who has pledged himself to make
a canvass from house to house and make :
an energetic endeavor to interview every
voter In the district in the interest of Hor
ace Davis for Mayor and the Republican ;
ticket In general.
Early in the campaign a Horace Davis
Club was organized in the district of
which the Mayoralty candidate is a resl- I
dent and Mr. Davis became an active '
member.
Some of th*> younger members took vm
brage at the oft-repeated remark of Mr.
Phelan in his numerous speeches that the
young voters of the City were almost a
unit in organizing- clubs in the interest
of Democracy under his leadership and
to show that Mayor Phelan's idea
not well founded proposed the org
tion of a young men's club in the interest
of Horace Davis and to make it a feature
of the campaign. A meeting was' called
at which a strong roll was signed and
officers elected as follows: N. H. Frank,
president; Sidney M. Ehrman. vice presi
dent; "Wallace Bradford, treasurer, and
I >. N. Hanna, secretary. An executive
committee, consisting of Messrs. Cadwal
ader, Faull. De la Matyr. Hollis. Riggs,
Frledlander. Baird, Gedney, Manuel,
Nixon, Ludwig, Dibble, Grler, Burnett and"

PHELAN'S BOASTED ECONOMY
DISPROVED BY PLAIN FIGURES
An enthusiastic meeting of the Twen
ty-eighth District Horace Davis Inde
pendent Republican Club was held last
night at 63$ Folsom street. Although pre
liminary organization of the club was
effected only last Wednesday night it al
ready has a membership of eighty-seven
voters, with the following officers: Pres
ident, J. W. Allan; vice president, T.
King; secretary. R. E. Cole; treasurer,
Charles G. Jaegar.
The first speaker last night was Major
\V. W. Allen, who proceeded In a convinc
ing: manner to show that the economy at
tributed to Mayor Phelan was not war
ranted by the facts and he quoted the fol
lowing nerures to prove the truth of his
assertions:
"The expenses of the municipality In
said Major Allen, "when Sanderson
was Mayor, were $5. 394, 155. In 18'.t3 and
1894, when Ellert was Mayor, they were
$5,177,324 48 and $4,931,068 39 respectively. In
1896 and lSf'6. when Sutro hold the office,
the expenses were $5,565.527 and 56,768,586 15
respectively, and In 1597. with Phe'.an,
they were Increased to â 56,403,575 2S, and
last year they amounted to $6,216.052 55.
The expenses of the health office Jumped
from $23,051 in 1892 'to $70,355 C 5 In 180 S.
These increased sums represent practi
cally the amounts which the political cor
moranta that surround Phelan have ab
sorbed."
The other speakers were R. B. McClel
lan. Edward Close, A. P. Black, Judge
J.'arhlnisen, J. H. Scott and others, and
the meeting concluded with three rousing
cheers for Horace Davis and the rest of
the Republican ticket.

name on the ticket was cheered as Its
owner came to the front to have his say.
Mayor Phelan was given an ovation, -and
hip speech, which had been heard pre
viously in other sections of the city, was
well received. Mr. Phelan gave nearly the
who!Â» of his time to denying that national
ipsut'S had anything whatever to do with
the present campaign. "Our Republican
friends insult your intelligence when they
say so," declared his Honor. "They try
to tell you that Mr. Hanna and Mr. Mc-

GREAT ISSUES
BEFORE POLITICS
Schurz's Stand Against
Imperialism.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI. Oct. 27.-A number of
prominent German citizens recently ad
dressed an invitation to Hon. Carl
Schurz to deliver an address in Cincin
nati. The following reply waa received
to-day:
NEW YORK, Oct. 23, 1599.
Dear Mr. Rattermann: It was a matter ot re
gret to me to be unable to accede to your re
quest to deliver a non-partiean address on Im
perialism In Cincinnati en my return trip from
Cnlcaxo. This wag partly due to my anxiety
to reach home and also because a non-partisan
discussion of this question is no longer recog
nized. I would be pleased If this question could
be taken out of party politics, because if this
Is not done the only choice that will be left
us next year will be between a party present-
Ing Imperialism and sound money and another
party which, In opposition to Imperialism, will
combine with It an unsound money issue. This
alternative can only be avoided If the Imperial
policy is removed, and the first step necessary
to that end Is not alone the cessation of hos
tilities by a victory of our arms, but the re
liiiquibliment of the Philippines. If the Fili
pinos are not granted their Independence then
lrriwrlaUGm would l^e the main Issue In the
Presldmtlal election next year, crowding all
other lesues.- Into the background. The signs
are already apparent and I see that the Cin
cinnati Vclksblatt warns us as follows;
"Practical peopls are of the opinion that Mr.
Schurz could be of greater service to the coun
try if he would come to Ohio and again fight
the silver swindle Instead of working Into the
hands of the free colnagers by placing annc-xa
tlcn into the foreground. For it is a fact that
free coinage represents a greater danger than
annexation."
I am of a different pattern. No ona can say
of me that I undervalue the danger that may
arise from free coinage. But I hold that im
perialism .13 decidedly more dangeroup, for :t
means the ruin of our free Institutions. If.
then, we could not oppose Imperialism without
working into the hands of the free coiner.-;, as
the Volksblatt says, what then? It means that
three years ago in good faith we elected a Presi
dent to solve the money question, who, in- '
stead, has burdened us with imperialism. In
this connection the warning to speak of some
thing else sounds peculiar.
Of what do the speakers who have been
called Into Ohio really ppeak? Did Governor
Roosevelt, for instance, dilate upon the silver
Question? He was principally occupied in call-
Ing us to hold up our heads in answer to antl
imperlallstic arguments. And the rest of the
orators do likewise.
If under these circumstances I would, by the
agitation of the silver question, aid the Repub
licans of Ohio to victory I would be convinced
that the administration would construe such
a victory and make unlimited capital out of It.
.Toward such a result I cannot conscientiously
contribute.
I am of the honest conviction that the great
est danger that now threatens the republic Is
Imperialism. I believe that It Is our highest
patriotic duty to set aside all party Interests
and to do our best to avert this danger. It w.is
to this end that last year I opposed the candi
dacy of Rooeevelt for Governor in thlj' State
I did this although I was a personal friend of
Roosevelt and worked with him for civil serv
ice reform. I believed then, and still believe.
that his defeat, with his Imperialistic pro
gramme, and in spite of his new-earned fame,
would have frightened the administration In
Washington from the annexation of the Phil
ippines, and in this manner the danger would
have been greatly minimized. Many of my
acquaintances here, who were then of a con
trary opinion, agree with me now that the re
sult of the sacrifice would have been well
worth the price. The situation this year ap
pears to me to be exactly the same. If the
fall elections result In a manner that the ad
ministration and Congress are encouraged to
further progress on the path of Imperialism,
then, unless unlocked for events should Inter
vene, the main question that will confront us
next year In the Presidential election will be
imperialism, and to save the republic from her
greatest danger will require unpleasant sacri
fices. Such encouragement to the administra
tion should be withheld at any cost. â¢
We are In the midst of a crisis in which every
good citizen should regard it as his highest
duty to make the least Important subservient
to the important, according to his knowledge
and conscience, and not permit himself to be
governed simply by party considerations. With
friendly greetings, yours, C. SCHURZ.

PHELAN HURLS A BOLD DEFI
AT THOSE WHO OPPOSE HIM
Mayor Phelan boldly defied the people of
this city last night in a speech before the
Montlcello Club. In words that left no
room for doubt as to their meaning he in
timated that If re-elected he would use
the charter for Phelan and for Phelan's
friends. No others need apply. The meet-
Ing, which was held In Metropolitan Hall,
was not given for the purpose of further-
Ing the interest of any particlar candi
date. â¢ The members of the Montlcello
Club take an academic interest in politics
and had Invited Mayor Phelan and Frank
lin K. Lane to address them in a general
way on municipal matters. Mr. Lane kept
within the bounds and delivered a very
Interesting and instructive address. No
one was given a hint, from anything he
said, that he was a candidate for office,
or that San Francisco wa.s going to have
a municipal election within a few days.
With the Mayor it was different. He got
started off all right, but toward the wind
up he could not resist the temptation to
talk about himself, about his charter,
about his Democratic party and about his
San Francisco. Referring to his power of
appointment he said virtually that no Re
publican who was not a Phelan Republi
can during his campaign would stand a
ghost of a show of receiving any of his
political favors.
"The charter provides," said the Mayor,
"that as many Republicans as Democrats
must be appointed on the public commis
sions; but I want to say right here that
If any Republican expects to be repre
sented on those commissions he must
come from the ranks of those who meet
us on an equality. No traitor to the char
terâno Republican who has dared to at
tempt to force national affairs into our
local campaign will be given considera
tion."
DR. VOORS ANGER ANSWERED.
Majority of His Coreligionists Will
Support Horace Davis.
Editor Call: There has lately appeared
in an evening paper an article by Rev.
Dr. Voorsang-?r favoring the cause of Mr.
Phelan. The reverend doctor would per
haps resent the charge of having dispar
aged Mr. Davis. But he has, to say the
least, "damned him with faint praise."
The reverend doctor's good taste in thus
descending from the pulpit Into the arena
of practical politics is not here the ques
tion. Upon that point perhaps Americans
are universally agreed. But the doctor,
whatever the merit of his article, the
truth of his observations or the propriety
of his action, occupies a position that
gives to his utterances an added weight
derived entirely from the persons whose
spokesman citizens at large have a right
to presume him to be. That he is author
ized to voice the political opinions of his
coreligionists it is our present purpose to
deny. He is at liberty to express what
opinions of his own he sees fit, and noth
ing' but a sense of propriety and the dic
tates of good taste can exert an Influence
to prevent him. But in his article he
should have clearly indicated that he was
voicing his individual opinion only, and
he should not have used the columns of a
seeturian religious Journal to pronounce
a panegyric upon a political canuidate.
Rev. Dr. Voorsanger's views are dia
metrically opposed to those of a large
number if not the majority of persons
whose opinions he is erroneously pre
sumed to voice. Common candor and
fairness should have prompted him to
make that plain. Those whom the doctor
presumes to represent are overwhelm
ingly Republican, and we venture to say
find- in Mr. Davis a candidate worthy of
their support. Whatever of praise for
civic virtues applies to Mr. Phelan applies
with equal if not greater force to Mr.
Davis, and such being the case it is
scarcely to be supposed that those per
sons whose natural inclinations as well
as material interests favor Republican
doctrines will swerve from their alle
giance, IRVIN J. WIEL

PHELAN WANTED TO RESIGN
FROM CHARTER ASSOCIATION
The Republicans of the Thirty-third As
sembly District held a meeting last night
at Masonic Hall, corner of Fourteenth
and Railroad avenues. South San Fran
cisco. William McHugh as chairman of
the meeting introduced Horace Davis as
the first speaker of the evening. Mr.
Davis spoke briefly and in part said:
For the first time in the history of San Fran
cisco we have had an hunest, fair primary elec
tion. The Republicans had a good convention, '
resulting In the making of the strongest and as
a whole the best ticket ever presented to the
voters of this city. In regard to myself. I say
with due modesty that what I now own I made
here and have invested It all in San Francisco,
not in land and stocks, but In a business that
has for many years given employment to fr m
75 to 100 men, whose wages were always forth
coming on Saturday nicht. I have yet failed
to find an ex-worker of mine who is not work- I
Ing for me now politically.
I feel proud to. say that while In Congress !
I worked hard and faithfully for and it was
through my efforts and those of my colleagues i
that the exclusion bill was passed. In my j
own affairs I have had to deal with some I
Important Issues, and therefore I don't lack j
experience. If elected Mayor I think that my |
connections with the State University. as j
trustee of the public library and the mechani- i
cal school in the Potrero, where 3M boys and j
girls are taught how to earn their livings,
ought to make me capable of appointing a !
good Board of Education. I promlÂ«e you that i
I will give to the people as good an adminls- |
tratlon as I have given to my own business. .-
It Is the duty of every' citizen to work hard !
for the upholding of a party which has given j
San Francisco the greatest era of prosperity ;
since her birth and vote the Republican ticket |
from top to bottom.
A. P. Van Duzer, In speaking- for the |
ticket, said that in Mr. Davis the people j
had an ideal man for Mayor. He told his
listeners that James D. Phelan had be
trayed the people In the charter fight of
1896. As soon as Mr. Phelan received the
nomination for Mayor In October. 1896,
he came before the Charter Association
and stated that he was compelled to re
sign nis chairmanship of mat association
and to witniiraw from any further active
participation In the campaign for the
charter.
"I state as a fact." said the speaker,
"that he did then and there give as a
reason that his iriends haa advised him
that it was highly improper for him to
take any further part in favor of that
instrument and that he was as silent as
a salted codfish on that subject after
ward will not be denied, by Mr. 'Jlmmie'
Phelan. If Mr. Phelan had had the
courage of his own convictions and had
refused to obey the boss on that occasion
wo would have had a charter four years
ago."
Frank McGowan, the speaker of the
evening, said that the Republican party
Is to be congratulated in not being cursed
with bosslsm, while the Democratic
party has in Mr. Phelan a leader who
owns and controls his party life, body and
soul. He does as he pleases with it, holds
it in his hands and says. "I am your
boss." The principle of the Democratic
party has been "Government by the par
ty." Mr. Phelan cuts that out and says.
"Government by Phelan." The Democrat
ic party of this city is without a platfoim
and carried on with the gold of a politi
cal calf. They claim to be the only Si
mon Pure and say without the name of
Phelan there is no Democratic party.
They claim the credit for the new charter
and the Australian ballot law, but James
D. Phelan claims the whole partyâwith
out the platform.

But Is Given a Warm
Argument.
Special t>lapnt<ih to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 27.â The Initial boxing
entertainment of the "West End Athletic
Club was hold to-night at its now quar
ters In the Coliseum.- The bright partlc-.
ular star of the night was "Kid" McCoy,
who appeared with Billy Sttft of Chicago
ue an opponent. It was figured that Mc-
Coy's form in his match to-night would
largely formulate public opinion In ref
erence to his chances with Peter Maher.
and as a consequence 7000 sport lovers
wore in attendance. McCoy had the ad
vantage of Stift In height and reach, but
In weight the latter was favored by sev
eral pounds. For the first half-dozen
rounds Stift appeared "to be in great awe
of bis famous -opponent- and remained
on the defensive. As a matter of fact
McCoy was able to draw him out only a
few times during the thirteen rounds of
lighting. Stift showed that he was a
fighter, and eoveral times had the "Kid"
in a ticklish position.
In the opening rounds McCoy avoided
Stiffs swings by sidestepping and Jabbing
him continually. In his efforts to retal
iate Stift fought like a wild man. McCoy
fell down In the second round in an at
tempt to get away from Stift, who, in a
rush, swung a heavy left on the stomach.
After the third, round Stift began fight
ing with mare confidence, irequently
rushing McCoy to the ropes.
In the twelfth round Stift landed a
heavy right on McCoy's chin, sending
him to the floor, where he stayed several
seconds. Stift followed up his advantage
by rushing McCoy around the ring, but
came to grief a moment later, as McCoy
landed hard hits on Stiffs ear and chin,
and Stift went down, only to be saved by
the gong.
In the thirteenth round both fought
hard for a finishing blow. Stift fell down
from the force of a left swing which he
failed to land, but he was up in a second
and rushed McCoy to the ropes. Follow
ing a clinch McCoy jabbed his left to the
nose, and quick as a flash swung his
right heavily to the point of Billy's chin.
SUft fell like a log and was counted out.
After he was counted out McCoy helped
carry the fallen man to his corner. Suit
did not recover for some time.
Before the middeweights appeared Cas
par Leon of New York and Steve Flanna-'
ijan of Philadelphia came on for twenty
live rounds to settle their dispute as to
who" was entitled to the title of champion
bantamweight of America, The boys put
â up a very clever article of fighting. Flan
nagan played principally - tor the body,
while Loon went to the head. Flannagan
was constantly the aggTessor and in the

on the verge of collapse, but his ring gen
eralship saved him. At the end of the

and swung a right to the ear. Steve landed
twice with his left on the chin at the bell.

gamely. Caspar was weak and groggy at

fourth rounds, but each time recovered
sufficiently to prevent a knockout.

Leon all over the ring 1 . Flannagan was
awarded the decision' on points.

SHORT ONES
IN THE RING
BOWLED OVER
Disastrous Day for Favorites
at Oakland â Ailenna First
at Long Odds.
Favorite players found it difficult to
keep on their sea legs so tempestuous was
it for the first choices at the track across
the bay yesterday. Corolla, Modwena,
Rachel C and Opponent, all pronounced
favorites at one stage of the betting, went
down with a crash. Many of the book
makers, who have been hard hit for sev
eral days past, evened up their losses
over the reverses suffered by the talent.
The track was lightning fast and fast
time was the rule. Songer and Jones di
vided the saddle honors.
â  To Master Jack Martin belonged the
honor of piloting the longest priced win
ner of the afternoon. The Ktle paper
weight rider straddled Ailenna, owned by
Carruthers and Shields, in the five-fur
long scramble for two-year-olds, and the
ring at one stage laid 25 to 1 against the
filly. She had speed to burn, and after
Martin had extricated himself from a
pocket a. furlong from home she overtook
and downed Druldess a neck on the wire.
Rachel C, the favorite, never looked dan
gerous.
Eddie Jones took the opening sprint for
maiden two-year-olds with Gundara, one
of the second choices, chiefly through
good riding. Passing the Boots entry,
lllilouette, opposite the paddock he suc
ceeded in reaching the wire first by a
head. Gold Finder, played from 15 to 3Vis,
ran a close third. Thorpe, astride Corolla,
was cut oft Just as the barrier was re
leased, never being a contender.
Another piping hot choice was beaten
in Modwena, 3 to 5 favorite for the sprint
.over the Futurity course, which followed.
Johnny Woods had the leg up and losing
much ground by a wide turn into the
stretch managed to be led over the line
by Jack McCabe, a 7 to 1 shot, superbly
riddon by Songer. Show-honors went to
The Offering, with Thorpe in the saddle.
Dr. Rowell had the chestnut gelding Dr.
Bernays tuned to concert pitch the first
time out of the box and he annexed the
mile selling run without effort from Sor
row. Eddie Jones, who rode the winner,
was pocketed until squared away for the
stand, where he found an opening and
galloped to the front. Ranch, on Castake,
made a poor guess of it, getting beaten
for the show by Charles Le Bel, an 80 to 1
shot, which led for some distance,
â¦v, a tl i c seven-furlong event Rosinante.
t t. to c lO rav orite, was given quite a
j" ub b>' ?'>'â  Thorpe on the latter mare
headed Lothian below the paddock, and
for a time it looked as if the favorite
would not get up in time. She. however,
responded gamely, as usual, to Ward's
call and finishing like a Kansas cyclone
Zâ¢f h v, a ', f a , len th in 1:2% Cromwell,

Track Notes,
The race for the Burlin K ame Club cup
the swagger society event of the season
nt Oakland, will be the foature of to-day's
card. The horses contesting will be rid
den by gentlemen riders, all prominent
members of the Burlingame Club. Lieu
tenant Haines of the army, who will pilot
0 Connor, participated in the Cuban cam
paign and was at the receiving end of a
-Mauser bullet iii the memorable charge
up San Juan Hill, whore he was ilanger
ouflly wounded. Mr. T ibta, Mr. Page Mr
Dunphy and Mr. Martin are* also finished
borsemen and society will give the cup
winner a splendid ovation.
Harry Kuhl, one of the officials of the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club, arrived from
1 liuago yesterday.
Sea Lion of the Schorr string had an
attack of lung fever soon after the stable
arrivea here, but is now on the mend
Another carload of horses from Chicago
reacwed Oakland yesterday. G w Scon
brought back San Mau-o and Garter E
TS . Fogg had Gotobed and Midian- O p'
Komigh Mocorifo and Defiance, and J W
O'Neil, Frank Bell and Gussie Fay in the
car. I- rank Bell, according to all reports
Is a very rapid mover and will earn more
than one set of brackets.
Lee Turner, an older brother of Xash
is a recent arrival from the East He
has been in good standing for some time
now and announces his intention of get
ting down to weight and having a try of
it in the saddle. He was formerly a very
polished artist.
Songer Is- riding in much better form
than when he first got here. Yesterday
he rode two winners in Jack McCabe and
Wyoming; was once second and twice
third.
Gold Finder, an Imp. Clieveden young
ster owned by Mat Storn, had his price
swiped from 15 to 3Vfe. If Johnny Woods
had takf-n advantage of an opening next
the rail, a furlong from the wire, he
would have won.
Dan Dennison concluded yesterday to
keep Morgan on the ground for a couple
of days, or until he got his hand in. Seems
as if the jockey could acquire the art
more quickly riding In races.
It would look as if Cromwell had be
come a confirmed "bleeder" and after
yesterday's race the officials In the stand
decided that in future the horse's entry
would not be received at Oakland.

JEFFRIES
NEVER IN
FINER TRIM
Champion's Condition Is De
clared to Be Better Than
Ever Before.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASBURY PARK, Oct. 27.â Jeffries has
had more trouble. This time It Is not an
Injured arm, but a stiff neck which kept
him comparatively Idle yesterday.
"Jeff" does not know how he got It, but
thinks that perhaps It was the result of
one of his rough wrestling bouts with
Ernest Robere, The big fighter's neck
was all right this morning, and he felt
much relieved as he began work as usual
with his run on the road.
The strangest thing about Jeffries Is
that for a big man he Is never tired or
winded after these road gallopsâ and most
â¢of them are fast trips. He Is now In great
shape and says he Is better than when he
fought Fltzslmmons.
Everybody, Including trainers and all
who have seen the big Los Angeles boiler
maker train, are brimful of confidence
that he will beat Sharkey next Friday
night. Jeff does not believe In throwing
bouquets at himself. He never has been
heard to remark that he will surely beat
Sharkey, but, judging by his good-natured
way of evading direct questions on the
subject, it Is evident he lacks no confi
dence In his ability to do so. He says he
Is ready to begin the fight at any moment.
The champion had a lot of company
from New York to-day. The visitors were
headed by John L. Sullivan, and included
about fifty sporting men and politicians.
The former champion and his friends
were -interested observers of the big. Call
fornian while he was training, and when
he had finished they said they felt satis
fled that Sharkey would be a toy In
Jeffries' hands next- Friday night. Sul
livan particularly was impressed with the
new champion and surveyed him carefully
[ from head to foot, asking lats of ques
tions.
NEW YORK. Oct. 27.~Gus Ruhlin, who
has fought both Jeffries and Sharkey,
said to The Call correspondent:
"It is over two and a half years since I
fought Jeffries in San Francisco. Jeffries
showed himself to be a remarkably clever
man, shifty on his feet, and, while he was
not gifted with the best ring generalship,
he nevertheless made up for this lack of
tactics by his punching powers. Jeffries
struck me as Deing a terriblo puncher,
and some of the smashes he gave me with
both hands made me see all kinds of
things.
"As to Sharkey I can't say much; but I
do know that he Is another great fighter
and also a terrific puncher. He clearly
convinced me that he was when he beat
me at Coney Island over a year ago with
a smash on the jaw. The sailor will be
at a disadvantage in this fight, however,
owing to Jaffries' height, weight and
reach; but in spite of this Sharkey has
as good a chance to win as Jeffries."
For the first time in more than a week
Sharkey was unable to take a sea bath
to-day. The mist was so heavy that the
sun's rays were lost and Tom feared the
cold water would do him more harm than
good. Others around the camp have found
a bit too much chilliness prevailing in
the bay for at least three weeks, but the
brawny Irishman thinks plowing in the
icy waves the greatest sort of sport.
Another change was made in his out
door work to-day. Instead of running
five miles as Manager O'Rourke ordered
he strolled leisurely over to the Newdorp
station, from Southfleld a mile and a half,
and then went back on the run. Sharkey
came up to expectations. Trainer Tim
McGrath drove alongside and coached
him. The big fellow cantered along in
his own gawky way and In the last quar
ter of a mile let himself out. At the fin
ish Tom *as breathing a little more than
usual, but was far from being worked
out.
The regrular gymnasium work was done
in the afternoon, but not so much of it as
on Thursday. Sharkey was only in the
building Â£n hour and a half all told.
CONNOLLY FIGHTS FAST.
Has the Better of Matty Matthews in
Their Encounter.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27.â At the Broadway-
Athletic Club to-night the star attraction
was a 25-round bout at 13S pounds between
Eddy Connolly of St. John, N. 8., and
Matty Matthews of Brooklyn. They went
the twenty-five rounds and Referee
Johnny White declared the bout a draw.
It was a hard fight all the way through
and each man was disfigured early In the
game. At close quarters Connolly sur
prised Matthews with stinging rights on
the ribs and over the kidneys.
In the seventh round Matthews' left eye
was cut and bled profusely. In the twelfth
Matty caught Connolly flush on the nose
with his left and set it bleeding.
The fifteenth round was the most sensa
tional one of the fight. The men rushed
to a clinch, both pounding hard on the
body with both hands until ordered to let
go by the referee. As Matthews stepped
back Connolly caught him with a left
swing on the head which sent him to the
floor, where he remained about five sec
onds. A few moments later Connolly
landed a similar blow In a breakaway and
Matty took eight seconds. Matthews got
to close quarters when he got up and
some bruising work over the kidneys was
performed by both men. Connolly did the
largest share of the fighting hero, and
with a smashing left reopened the cut
over Matthews' left eye. Matthews was
weak and clinched frequently until the
bell rang.
In the twenty-first round Connollv
rushed Matthews to the ropes twice and
Matty clinched each time. Connolly sent
his right hard over the kidney's and

At the close of the twenty-fifth round
Connolly had such a decided lead, that it

CHOYNSKI THE WINNER.
Experiences No Difficulty in Putting
Out Steve O'Donnell.
CHICAGO, Oct. 27.â Joe Choynski de
feated Steve O'Donnell to-night In the
fifth round of what was to have been a
six-round bout. There was nothing In It
but Choynski from the start, O'Donnell
making a very poor showing.
In the first round the Californlan landed
a straight right on the mouth that
dropped O'Donnell cleanly. The bell rang
when he had been down three seconds,
but he went to his corner very groggy.
At almost any time after that Choynski
could have won, but he went at It easily.
In the fifth he put O'Donnell down twice
and the latter was so clearly out of it
that Choynski said to him, "Stay down
stay down."
O'Donnell was unable to rise, anyhow,
and took the advice and allowed himself
to be counted out without attempting to
rise. One more punch would have finished
him if he had regained his feet. O'Don

GETTING READY FOR SEA.
Sailors Hard at Work on, the Chal
lenger Shamrock.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27.â With her stub
bowsprit in place, both her masts stepped,
topmast on end and gaff and booms slung,
the yacht Shamrock is rapidly assuming
a sea-going appearance.
Sailormen were at work setting up the
rigging to-day, while carpenters fitted
the hold for the accommodation of officers
and men. Water tanks have been put in
and iron braces bolted to the fore and alt
deck and keels on stringers. Additional
wooden knees have been fitted between
the frames forward, where the yacht is
liable to "pound" in a head wind.
Captain Hogarth says that he will take
her stores en board ship at Erin Basin in
stead of going to Tompklnsville, and that
she will turn direct to sea from the basin.
Her sails will be bent to-morrow.
"FITZ" TALKS FIGHT.

CHICAGO, Oct. 27.â 80b Fltzsimmons
reached Chicago to-day for his fight with
Jeff Thome at Tattersall's to-morrow
night. .
"I am the logical opponent of the win
ner of the Jeffries-Sharkey match," said
he. "Jeffries, I think, will be the win
ner. What is more, I hope he will. Th;.t
will give me another chance to right my
self before the public. Before many
months I intend to be not only the mid
dle-weight champion, which I am now,
but the champion of the world as well."

VANDERBILT'S
WILL IS FILED
No Reference to Trouble
With Cornelius.
Bpoclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Oct. 27.â The will of the
I late Cornelius Vanderbilt was filed for
, probate in the Surrogate's office this af
ternoon. The provisions of the will are
i substantially the same as mentioned in
the synopsis given out Thursday by C.
M. Depew. The clause relating to Cor-
I nelius Vanderbilt Jr. contains no direct
reference to the alleged troubles said to
have occurred between the young man
and his father. The facts as given out
previously by Senator Depew relating to
this olause of the will are substantiated
lln the will. Nothing is mentioned con
j cerning his name further than is neces
} sary to make the bequest of the one and
I one-half millions.
In the thirteenth clause of the will a
! bequest Is made to the mother of the de
ceased, which reads:
"To my mother, as a mark of affection,
i I beQueath one hundred thousand dol
, lars; also one hundred thousand dollars
1 to my brother, William K. Vanderbilt."
In the twelfth clause, wherein the trus-
I tees of the several funds are directed to
' invest the proceeds arising from certain
i securities, the will designates what se
. curities ana to be so managed. They con
! sist of United States and State of New
York bonds, mortgage bonds of the New
York Central and Hudson River Railroad,
the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern
Railroad, the New York and Harlem i
Railroad Company and the Chicago and
I North western Railway Company. The will
gives the added Information that the ex
ecutors are directed to pay annually to [
: the Society of St. John the sum of $2000
I so long as the officials of that society
I keep an agreement made in 1892 with the
, deceased and Mrs. Vanderbilt. When the
i agreement shall be broken the annuity
, ceases. % There were no further differ
; ences to be seen between the will and the
! synopsis given out on Thursday evening. j
The Tribune to-morrow will say:
The provisions of the will of Cornelius Van
derbilt, which were made public yesterday, ex
cited Intense Interest. From certain remarks
It appears that this settlement alone, effected
after long discussion, prevented a contest that
might have resulted in one of the greatest and
costly will litigations ever 'Known. Cornelius
Vamierbllt Jr.. when he learned the provisions
of his father's will, placed his Interests in the
hands of his counsel, Carter & Ledyard. They
conducted negotiations with Henry B. Ander
; Bon, the attorney of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt.
, While none of those interested would say what
was done, enough has been admitted to indicate
i that had Alfred not made the concession
! mentioned litigation would have followed.
Cornelius Vanderbilt was at the Grand Central ;
station yesterday. Alfred was at Newport.
When Cornelius was seen he dismissed the sub
ject by saying: "Whatever arrangements may
! have been made were through my attorneys.
Carter & Iyvlyard. I have no comment to make
i upon the settlement. It was a family arrange-
I ment and not a rift."
The World to-morrow will publish the
1 following: Cornelius Vanderbilt. at his
! homo, 60S Fifth venue, at 10:45 o'clock
last (Friday) night made this important
: statement to a World reporter:
"The agreement by which I receive $6.
--000,000 of my brother's portion of the
i estate has been made to appear as a mere
| gift. It Is no gift, but the result of a
compact entered Into before my father's ,
j death. By this compact I was to receive |
!no less than $10,000,000. The truth of the j
i matter Is that an agreement of an adjust
ment was made from the beginning. Yes,
I may say from the beginning to the. end.
There was an understanding between us
that my share should be no less than
$10,000,000."
"When was the agreement made?"
"I can only say that it was some time
1 prior to my father's death. The matter
; since then has been in the hands of my
lawyers. Carter & Ledyard. They have
absolute charge of my interests."
Mr. Vanderbilt was asked If there would
| be an amicable settlement of the estate
on the basis indicated by the transfer of
f5.000.000 to him from Alfred's portion. To
this he replied:
"You must excuse me. I will not dis
cuss thÂ« matter further. I Just wish to be
set right before the public. All my inter
ets are In my lawyer's hands."

AGNEWS NEW CHIEF
MAY BE TURNED DOWN
Crane's Opposition to Appointment by Po
litical Pull Makes Him Unpopular
Among the Trustees.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 27.â The Agnews Insane
Asylum has been rescued from the frylng
pan of scandal only to be cast into the flre
of politics. The new medical superinten
dent, Dr. J. C. Crane, it is stated, is to be
punished for his disapproval of "pull"
methods in the management of the insti
tution and for expressing himself bo freely
concerning the political policy of Governor \
Gage. If he does not lose his position he
will bo confronted with a Board of Trus- j
tees that will not uphold him in his ad- i
ministration and will make things bo un- I
comfortable for him that his retirement to I
private life will be preferable to continu
ing In office.
The last meeting of the) board, the sen- j
sational features of which were published '
exclusively in yesterday's Call, upset all ;
the plans of the reformers, while those !
who have been fattening by means of |
their political "pull" suffered from paraly
â U. Dr. J. R. Curnow â¢ almost lost his
senses when he read in Dr. Crane's report
a brief but pointed reference to a "pull."
Trustee Adolph Greenlnger was also much
shocked in the region of his political solar
plexls. These members of the board, with
Trustee O. A. Hale, compose the commit
tee on management, and It has been cus
tomary for the statements of the medical
examiner to be embodied in the commit
tee's report. Without letting Mr. Hale
into the secret, Curnow and Greeninger
sidetracked Dr. Crane's report and made
a futile effort to bury it out of sight. Its
absence at the meeting was noted, and
when it was read, in compliance with a
demand for its contents, the storm broke
forth.
All the applications for positions in the
asylum had previously been referred to
this committee and the opportunity for
the members to exercise a "pull" in re
warding their political parasites was cor
respondingly great. Trustee Isaac Upham
grasped the situation, and to improve the
atmosphere, moved that In future these
applications be referred to the medical
superintendent. Curnow and Greeninger
were horror-stricken with the idea that a
man who had boldly disapproved of "pull"
methods in making appointments should
have any voice whatever in the selection
of employes. They raised such a howl
about It that a compromise measure was
offered, but those who were partial to
"pull" politics would not stand for any
thing but the good old way of doing
things.
The misery of Curnow was complete
when Dr. Crane announced that he had
made up his mind to discharge one of the
attendants, who was then enjoying a va
cation, as soon as he returned. He stated
that the man was not only several bad
DIES PROTESTING
HIS INNOCENCE
Rev. G. E. Morrison Exe-
cuted for Murder.
Special Dispatch to The C&JI.
DALLAS. Tex.. Oct. 27.â Rev. G. E. Mor
rison was hanged at 12 o'clock noon to
day at \>rnon, Tex., for wife murder. Ha
met death resignedly. On the scaffold
he said to the select party of twenty wit
nesses permitted at the execution:
"I am innocent. Circumstances over
j which I have no control have placed me in
this position. I have taken my trouble in
private to my God. I admit that I have
acted indiscreetly. I have done no worse,
j however, than hundreds of men who
stand high in the religious, social, busi
ness and official circles of your State. I
have done nothing to confess. I am in
the hands of my Maker. He knows I am
innocent."
Morrison's neck was broken by the fall
and his death appeared to bo painless.
VERXOX, Tex., Oct. 27.â The crime for
| which Rev. G. R. Morrison paid the death
penalty was the poisoning of his wife in
October, 1897. The facts show that for
deliberate fiendishness they are almost
without a parallel In the annals of crim
inal jurisprudence. The crime was com
mitted in order to rid himself of a pretty,
amiable, loving wife. In order to marry
a woman possessed of large means, $100,000
of which was in cash.
Morrison married his deceased wife
about seventeen years ago. At one time
they lived in California, then In Oklahoma
Territory, from which place they moved
to Panhandle, Tex., where the crime waa
committed. He was born and raised In
Illinois, and went to school at Carbondale.
There he became acquainted with Miss
Anna Whittelsey, who subsequently
moved with her parents to Topeka, Kans. ;
In August, previous to the poisoning of
his wife In October, 1897, Morrison met
Miss Whlttelsey, his schoolday sweet
heart, ascertained her financial condition
and made an offer of marriage. He pre
tended that his wife had been dead eleven
years, that he had quit preaching, had
been successfully engaged In the cattle
business for eight years and owned a
ranch near Higgins, Tex. On his return
to Texas he began a correspondence with
Miss Whittelsey, urging his proposition
of marriage, stating that he had for a j
number of years Intended to come to her
when he could do so honorably, and he
believed he could now see the time. This
statement was made one month before
the death of his wife.
He procured strychnine for the osten
sible purpose of poisoning "varmints,"
which he said were catching his chick
ens. On the day previous he had procured
a box of quinine with empty capsule*. On
the Friday night before her death Mrs.
Morrison went to hear the Swiss bellring
ers, leaving Morrison at home. He said
he had to prepare his Sunday sermon.
The next morning he took the strychnine
back to the druggist, telling him he was
afraid to use it for fear he. would poison
his neighbors' chickens. The package had
been opened. >
On Sunday night he preached and allud
ed In a pathetic manner to the parting
with loved ones at death. About 10 o'clock
that night he called upon his neighbors
for assistance, announcing the serious ill
ness of his wife. She was found in
spasms. He delayed sending for a doctor,
who arrived after his wife's death.
In the meantime he kept up his corre
spondence with Miss Whlttelsey. writing
her a letter two days before the death of
his wife and one the day after her burial.
In the latter letter he announced the
death of his brother's wife and notified
her of his early visit to Topeka. .
On his return from Topeka he was ar
rested, held a few days, was released on
bonds and fled. About three months there
after lie was rearrested in San Francisco,
returned to Texas, tried, with Miss Whit
telsey as the main prosecuting witness,
and given the death penalty.
TWO HANGINGS IN TEXAS.
Walter Ford and Samuel Watrous
Pay the Penalty for Murder.
DALLAS. Tex., Oct. 27.â Walter Ford,
â¢who cruelly murdered hi? sweetheart, Ln
clnda Moore, at Waco In June, IS9S, waa
lianged in that city to-day. llÂ© died with
out faltering, saying he was going
straight to heaven.
AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 27.â Samuel Wat
rous, one of the murderers of G. W. Eng
berg and his wife, was hanged In the jail
yard here to-day. Watrous said he waa
going to heaven. James Davidson, con
victed of the same crime, will be hanged
on November 24.
Briscoe's Slayer Hang-ed.
IRWIMTON. Ga., Oct. 27â Mack Can
non, a negro, was hanged here to-day for
the murder of William Brisooe near Ivy
Station In April last.
thing's but a fool In th<Â« bargain. Pressed
for an explanation, the doctor said that
the man had been in the habit of playing
the Peeping Tom and had no better sense
than to tell about It.
Dr. Curnow turned blue when Dr. Crane
revealed the name of the man. It was
! H. N. Turner, a chum of Curnow's, who
: had been "pulled" into office by the trus
tee. This Is one of the reasons that CurÂ»
nuw and his colleague. Greeninger, voted
against allowing ihe medical superinten
dent's report to become any part of the
Trustees' records.
Now comes the part that Governor Gage
plays In the affair. When he recommend
ed the appointment of Crane, he recom
mended better than hÂ© knew. Gage and
the "pull" have stood In pretty well to
gether. Crane was the Governor's friend,
lie admits this himself. Naturally, Gage
supposed that the physician would not op-
POM his methods, but did not have cne
forethought to ask him. The Trustees did
not dream that the Governor would force
a man upon them who could not be han
dled without difficulty, and when the
truth was revealed in that "pull" para
graph of Crane's report the atmosphere
around Agnews was blue from the audible
expressions of chagrin from the Trustees
and the Governor. The Trustees have ac
cused the Governor of passing a gold
brick off on them, and Gage has been
wondering If he himself has not been bun
koed. And now he is seeking revenge.
Those of the Trustees who were congrat
ulating themselves that the Agnews Asy
lum was about to become a creditable lh~
stltutlon, free from scandal and politics,
fear that the Executive will carry out his
threats.
The terms of three of the five members
expire shortly. Greeninger of San Jose
and Edward White of Watsonville go out
of office next month. Curnow will cease
to be a Trustee In January. White in
dorses Dr. Crane's independence and
method of management and does not ex
pect to be reappolnted. Cnrnow and
Greeninger. It Is stated, have assured their
friends that they are all right. They are
against Crane. The plan of the Governor.
It is announced. Is to appoint some one in
White's place who will oppose Crane.
With a majority of the Trustees against
him it will be imposible for the Medical
Superintendent to carry out the reforms
be contemplates. But what difference
does that make so long as he Is punished
for differing from the Govern rÂ»?
"The Agnews Asylum will lead any
llar State Institution within .-.x luo.itha, â 
said Trustee Upham, "if Dr. Crane is per
mitted to carry out hts policy of reform
In its management. My only fear Is tnat
on account of the political misunderstand
ing between him and the Governor, Gage
will not appoint a board that will uphold
him."
BELIEVES ANDREE
HAS NOT PERISHED
View of a Brother of the
Explorer.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
' MOBILE, Ala., Oct. Evelyn B.
Baldwin, the Arctic explorer ; and ob
server In the United States Weather Bu
reau, who has been assigned to duty at
this station, has arrived here from Wash
ington. He has just received a letter
from Captain Ernest Andree of Sweden,
brother of the polar aeronaut, and has
given to the press the following extract,
urecislve of Andree's confidence in his
brother's safety and his conjectures as to
his whereabouts:
My opinion is that if my brother had landed
! anywhere between S6 and SS degrees north lati
: tude and TO or SO degrees west and ISO degrees
west (Greenwich meridian) we would have
I heard frcm him. But, not having heard di
i rectly from him as to his having landed, I
1 think he must have come down to the west 0"
i 180 decrees and between 83 and 87 degrees
I north. From $5 degrees north and ISO degrees
(rest It Is about 750 miles to the nearest known
I land, to New Siberia, Taymur. Franz Josef
: Land, Greenland and the Parry Islands. At
the -ame rate In tha progress made by Nansen
of three miles It would take him two years to
reach the coast of the Parry Islands, and an
other year before he could communicate with
civilization. My brother several times ex
pressed his wish to examine the ocean north of
the Parry Islands.
The last one of my brother's buoys was found
on the north coast of Iceland. Lately, how
ever, another has been found on the north
coast of King Charles Land, east of Spltzber
! gen. He had with him twelve buoys, eleven
smaller ones and a large one. the latter onÂ«
; being thrown out when the balloon was as far
! north as the expedition expected to reach.
If th expedition reached 80 or So degrees
north and 00 or 100 degrees east, and then got
[ northerly winds, it Is most likely they would
i have thrown the buoy, not exepcting to go any
! more to the north. But the wind might hayÂ»
: changed In a few hours azain to the south or
i southwest and thus have carried the balloon
1 to 84 or 66 degrees north and 90 degrees west of
! ISO degrees.
Here they may have larded in an unexplored
region, previous to reaching which they may
have sailed backward and forward several
times. Remember that the balloon sailed fif
teen or sixteen miles an hour during the first
three hours.
I do not put the least faith In any of the
many reports, with the exception, of course, of '
the pigeon message and the two buoys. I dc
not expect to hear anything more this year,
but expect to hear all the more next summer.
DEWEY TO ENTERTAIN
ON EXTENSIVE SCALE
Admiral Will Take a Prominent Part
in the Social Affairs of
Washington.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 27. â Admiral
Dewey Is expected to take a prominent
part In the social festivities of Washing
ton. The avowed purpose of the admiral
In securing such a large house a* that
selected by him waa that he might have
ample room to accommodate the guests
whom he proposed to invite to dinners and
other functions during the winter. Offi- I
cial and social residents here are making
arrangements for the entertainment of
Admiral Dewey. and it is expected Presi
dent McKinley will request his attend
ance at various state functions In the
White House.
There has been some misapprehension
as to Admiral Dewey's position when at- '
tending a function participated in by the
President and Cabinet, the diplomatic
corps and the army and navy, as will be
the case at the New Year's reception in
th .n White House. The Vice President
will follow the President and after him
the six Embassadors. Following the Em- l
bassadors. Cabinet Ministers will take I
rank and then the remaining members of
the diplomatic corps. Had the army. an '
officer with the rank of general he would
come next, as the War Department was
established before the Navy Department
but as Admiral Dewey has greater rela
tive rank than General Miles, who ranks
with a senior rear admiral he will nrÂ«
cede that officer and follow the diplomatic' S
corps.
Admiral Dewey has been obliged to can
cel his proposed trip to Chicago. He had !
accepted an Invitation to be the guest of
the city between November 15 and 30, but I
on account of the coming meeting of" thÂ» !
Philippine Commission he has written -a
letter explaining that It will be Impossi
ble for him to keep his engagement

SHAREHOLDERS
TRANSFER STOCK
Prospects Bad for Union
Bank Depositors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 27.â The directors of
the Insolvent Union Savings Bank levied
an assessment of $60 per share on the
bank stock this morning. It la made pay
able on Saturday, December 2, 1899, and
becomes delinquent on December 23. On
the capital stock of the bank this should
bring in $600,000, but not over one-half of
the stockholders are solvent, so the as
sessment cannot bo collected from them.
The full directorate was present at this
morning's meeting. President Rea and
Directors Dunlop, Simpson and Caldwell
favored the assessment. Opposing them
were Directors Calllsch, Jones and Eaton,
who claimed the assessment was exces
sive and more than was needed to pay
depositors after assets had been realized
upon.
President Rea opened the meeting by
reading a long statement of what he
termed was rottenness on the part of Di
rectors Calllsch, Jones and Eaton In the
management of the bank. It was a char
! acteristic Rea document, In which "me
I and pa" figured prominently, and he stat
|ed his reason for making it was "My
, faultless father would never be satisfied
i to have his son dishonor the name of Rea
! by placing money before duty In the per
formance of a trust imposed by law."
The statement declared Directors Cal
llsch, Eaton and Jones had tried to block
every movement he had made for the
benefit of the depositors; that they had
tried to evade the assessment already
levied and had disposed of their property
and stock In order to escape the $60 as
sessment about to be levied. According
to him they had also conspired to obtain
control of bank property Dy having the
bank buy. In delinquent stock sold for as
sessment, but the depositors had frus
trated this.
The trio of accused directors mildly ob
jected to the report being received, but It
became a matter of record. Jones stated
some of Rea's own acts had not pleased
the community and he did not believe in.
a man like him setting himself upae a
censor.
A resolution levying the $60 assessment
then carried. Some routine business was
considered, after which the session ad
journed.
A disclosure has been made that there
Is an organized attempt on the part of
the stockholders to evade all future lia
bility and thus defraud depositors out of
thousands of dollars they are rightly en
i titled to. It all came about through the
S carelessness of the stockholders' attor
i ney, whose clerk in a thoughtless moment
: this morning left a letter behind him on
â  the floor of the bank.
In the past few days nearly a ecoro of
; the heaviest stockholders have been as
signing their stock to parties who have
but little property and are not considered
reliable. .The $10 assessment per share
levied some time ago was paid in each mi
i stance and the cashier requested to trans
fer stock on the books. This was refused
in each case. In the last three days be
tween $11,000 and $12,000 has been paid in
this manner on the $10 assessment.
Shortly after the bank opened this
morning a clerk from S. G. Tompkins' of
fice, counsel for the stockholders, entered
the Institution and paid $3000 on the $10
assessment charged against C. H. Hop
kins of San Francisco. A demand was also
made that stock be transferred to D. W.
Sherman. After transacting the busi
ness the following circular was found on
the floor:
San Jose, Oct. 25, 1899.
C. H. Hopkins, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear
Sir: I wish to Inform you of the latest move
of some of the heaviest stockholders in the
Union Savings Bank, and would advise you to
do likewise. ?.-;â â¢â¢â 
The proposition on foot now Is for them to
pay the $10 per share assessment that has
been Just levied and have the suit against
them on this assessment dismissed, then assign
their stock over to some irresponsible party. Of
course the president (neither will the secre
tary) will not enter the transfer upon the
books of the bank; so we have drawn up and
eend you herewith some forms for the seller
and one for the buyer to sign, and these must
be served upon the president and the secretary.
On the !7th of this month, next Friday, there
will be an assessment of $60 per share upon
the stock of said bank, and It Is to try and
avoid cult on this that the transfers are being
made.
So now you must. If you will avail yourself
of this, find some one who will take your
stock. Then Indorse the same over to him and
tend inclosed papers after first carefully filling
In all blanks In the same. Then return papers
and stock to us, with 2 cents revenue for every
share of stock sold. This must be done and
papers returned to-morrow, as meeting takes
place Friday. We will find some one to serve
papers on thÂ« bank. Tours truly,
S. G. TOMPKINS.
There seems to be no trouble in getting
persons to assume the liability of the
stockholders, even with a $60 assessment
hanging over It, for the following persons
are among those who have recently made
transfers: Cyrus Jones. A. Eaton, F. K.
Ledyard, L. Callisch, Mrs. S. 1,. Knox-
Goodrich, Henry Sears, E. I. Kalfus, L.
F. Sanderson, I. G. Knowles, Emily C
"Woolley. Royal Cottle.- Sally T. Plummer,
A. W. Price, B. F. Richards and C. rl
Hopkins. In the list are three directors.
If these stockholders can escape paying
the assessment it will be a severe loss to
the depositors and It is doubtful If they
will ever get 25 cents on the dollar.
Attorney S. G. Tompkins returned this
evening from a two weeks' hunting trip
in Lassen County. He pronounced the
Hopkins letter a forgery. He said:
"I never sent out any such circular,
never authorized any one to send It out
for me and know nothing about It what
ever. How It came to be on one of mv
letterheads is a mystery. You will ob
serve that it is dated October 25. On
that day I was In Lassen County. I shall
make It my business to find out who has
been taking such a criminal liberty with
my name."
Fresno Man Missing.
FRESNO, Oct. 27.-Antone Houke went
to San Francisco October 16 to claim his
share In his mother's estate, promising: to
return on the 2('th. He stayed at Fahey"s
hotel and left the hotel with the money
on the evening of the 10th for homo. He
has never reached Fresno.

THE MAYOR ANALYZED.
; \ S some statements and some opinions of Mr.
/ \ Joseph Britton are constantly quoted by the
Mayor and his followers, and are suppo>ed to
be important because' lie has deserted his party ro
support Mr. Phelan, it is fair to turn to Democrats
who refuse to support Mr. Phelan and to consider
their analysis of him. These Democrats, led by their
ite for Mayor, Dr. Cleveland, are not support
ing Mr. Davis, so that their opinions are rather
stronger and trustier than the opinions of Mr.
Britton.
At the meeting held by these steadfasters and
standfasters in the Democratic party Dr. Cleveland
referred to his lifelong membership in the party, his
belief in its principles and determination that they
shall not be lost sight of at the convenience of Mr.
Phelan or anybody else. He said: "There is no issue
whatever about the charter. It was the work of the
people, not the work of Phelan. Being the work of
the people, they alone can change it." Mr. George
D. Giliespie, a Democrat of ability and good stand
ing, said: "The convention which nominated
Phelan and Dodge absolutely refused to indorse the
Chicago platform, which, though good enough for
Bryan and Maguire. was not good enough for
Phelan." Thi.s repudiation of principles, being solely
for the benefit of Mr. Phelan's ambition, in the be
lief that it will bring him Republican votes to make
him Mayor and increase his prestige, may be ex
ted to result in his saying to the Democracy later
on, "In the name of my prestige as a three-ply
Mayor I demand your nomination to a State or Fed
eral office." Having gained power to make this de
mand by repudiating the party platform and prin
ciples, he will ask in their name further promotion.
This is a sort of political shell game.
< Hllespie, completing his analysis, said: "That
tion of platform and principles is the reason
for Phelan's desire to cry out against raising na
in this campaign. They do not want
attention directed to their apostasy from the political
Jennings Bryan and the great mass
of Democratic voters."
The gentlemen who make these public statements
are well known men of high standing. Dr. Cleveland
served the public in office, faithfully and respect
. and is just as grand a grand old man as Grand
Man Britton. He sees, with rare keenness, the
â¢y of Mr. Phelan's charter issue. He sees that
Mr. Phelan's attitude at once raises the issue that the
<harter and the national Democratic platform are
tic, and that a candidate cannot stand on
both. He sees behind all this Mr. Phelan's purpose
to use the charter as a fetish to secure his present
ambition, and ultimately to use Democratic prin
ciples again when it suits his convenience and will
further promote his craving for office and power.
Therefore Dr. Cleveland bluntly declares that there
is no separate and distinct charter issue at all; that
the charter was made by the people, is the funda
mental law of the city and can only be changed by
the people. This being the case, the party conven
tions were held to nominate party candidates to the
es necessary to the administration of the char
ter. Mr. Phelan, therefore, by repudiating the prin
ciples of the party in whose name he was nominated,
has abandoned the solid ground of party principle
lias created an airy, fairy pathway to office which
lie calls "the charter issue." Here is a complete ex
pesure, from the most respectable Democratic
sources, of the straw issue set up by Mr. Phelan.
He pretends to go forth to fight "treason to the
charter." These Democrats say this is to conceal his
own treason to his party principles. They declare
treason to the charter to be non-existent, imaginary,
while Phelan's treason to his party is real and actual.
There seems to be no answer to the logic of their
1 coition and no offset to the clearness of their state
â¢ of it. As an apostate to his party, it i s their
function to administer the needed discipline to him.
As the creator of a false issue and attempting to reach
office on it, he seems to stand thoroughly exposed
by the men who have heretofore supported him, have
foregathered with him in party conventicles and
ought to know. him best. In his speech in the Thir
tieth Assembly District, the 24th inst., Mr. Phelan
snid: "I don't know what has become of your plat
form since I was here last. You then elevated your
candidates on a pedestal; now they have to stand on
the floor." It doubtless occurred to the real Demo
irats present that Mr. Phelan has also lost his plat
form since he was there last, and had no right to
rebuke them for making him stand on the floor.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 28, lS9f>.
THE IMPERILED REPUBLICS.
THE American people do not need the presenta
tion to the President of a request to offer
mediation between England and the free Boers
to whet their interest in the passing African spec
tacle. The amiable inattention to the request is not
the reflection of a similar mood of the people. A vast
empire which has belted the world with its power,
which has put the hard heel of its oppression upon
the necks of protesting people from Ireland to
Africa; which has slaughtered peasants for defend
ing their huts and blown in pieces from the mouths
of cannon men who in its service had learned to hate
it with unreasoning frenzyâ this power, equipped
with every engine of slaughter, every device for ex
termination, is moving upon two free states, two in
dependent and self-governing republics, with the
same terrifying manifestations of strength and the
same inhuman motives that actuated Persia to land
her innumerable hosts upon the plain of Marathon
to smother the Grecian commonwealth in its own
blood.
To meet this host, face it, if possible turn it, if not
to die in front of it and be trampled into the free soil
they defend, stand the embattled farmers of the two
republics, just as our forefathers stood at Lexington
and Concord and "fired the shot that was heard
around the world."
All freemen of the two states are in array. Paul
Kruger. President of the Transvaal, with his three
quarters of a century of age upon him, forgetting the
scars that embellish his giant body won in long ago
battles for the liberty which he now defends, turned
soldier again, is at the head of a division of his army.
On the other side, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain and Mr.
Cecil Rhodes, whose intrigues and ambitions have
turned the veldt into a slaughter pen and reddened
the vlcys with the blood of men, are not in front de
fending the flag they have sent on a graceless er
rand. One is in safe and distant London, calling his
countrymen traitors for protesting that murder is
not a civilizing vocation. The other is pent up in
Kimberley, trembling with a miser's fright, while he
guards a treasure of one hundred millions in dia
monds and shouts for soldiers to come and save the
glittering store from the fate the Indian treasury
suffered at the hands of Robert, Lord Give.
Official authority may speak coldly and vaguely of
our national interests, but the American people are
not indifferent to the mighty suggestions of the
spectacle.
Already the usual signs appear that tell of the need
of a manufactured appeal to American and British
sentiment to hold it together as one in support of
this destruction of republics. In London it is re
ported that the Boers misuse and disregard a flag
of truce: that they hold up their hands to surrender
and whei the British ground arms shoot them; that
the British surgeons report that the Boers are using
dumdum bullets. These are familiar devices. They
have been in use by us in the Philippines for eight
months. Our people have read all such reports and
their effect has been estimated in advance of their
publication. It is charged through censored sources
that Aguinaldo has used the same tactics, and some
among us have not been slow to seize the advantage
of making him say what they please, so as to appeal
to sentiment at home.
But let no one forget that the Boers have needed
to use no such device. They know that at the Peace
Conference at The Hague, on the soil of their an
cestors, when the Continental powers wanted to
abolish the dumdum bullet. England defeated the
proposition and the United States supported her. If
England use the dumdum the Boer makes no com
plaint. Being aware that England has them and de
feated their abolition, he has some also. Above all
things the Boer is no hypocrite and does not fight
by proclamation nor telegram. The prize for which
he fights is the same old prize of self-government for
which his ancestors fought Spain and Alva. The
jewels he guards are not diamonds. They are the
rights of man. Looking around the circle of the
nations he sees no friendly face among the strong,
and so with heart stoutened by his friendliness he
meets the invader and fights like a man, dies like a
man, and baptizes the Dark Continent with blood
that will cry accusing confusion through all time to
those who. pretending to love republican institutions,
saw him die for them with every lash dry and no
sign of sympathy.
The twelve-year-old boy of Oakland who stands
facing a four-year sentence in one of the State prisons
for an infamous offense presents a perplexing
problem to the authorities. He is too young to zo
to prison and too old in some things to be permitted
at large.
THE DEBRIS PROBLEM AGAIN.
rROM the description given of the debris dams
of the State, in a report prepared by G. F.
Allardt and issued by the Anti-Debris Associa
tion of the four counties of Sacramento Valley, it
appears the whole controversy between : the land
owners of the valley and the hydraulic miners is
likely to be reopened. Mr. Allardt says: "The sys
tem of impounding works as now carried on can
afford no protection to the valley interests; it is a
menace, a delusion and a snare. In my judgment
permanent relief and safety can be secured only by
the absolute and unconditional prohibition of hy
draulic mining."
How far the Anti-Debris Association indorses that
sweeping statement is not clear. In issuing the re
port the association, through its secretary, Robert
Cosncr, contents itself with inviting an examination
of the report, which it declares shows the insuffi
ciency of the dams constructed under the supervision
of the California Debris Commission.
According to the report the impounding works
authorized and accepted by the commission are, with
few and unimportant exceptions, dams or barriers
constructed across gorges or canyons which have
heretofore served as dumping places for hydraulic
mines. A list classified according to the material
used in the construction gives a total of 251 struc
tures, of which only 27 are constructed of durable
material â that is, stone or carth â the remainder being
constructed either in whole or in part of perishable
material, such as logs or brush, and subject to more
or less rapid decay.
It does not appear from the report that any of the
dams show signs of decay or are insufficient at pres
ent. It would seem, therefore, that the expert has
digued from his fears rather than from facts. If the
dams be oi the flimsy construction he reports they
will of course in time give way, but as they have been
approved and accepted by a commission appointed to
supervise them, the presumption is they are ade
quate to the needs now and can be repaired and
strengthened as future emergencies may require.
The controversy is one in which the whole State is
interested, and the property at stake on each side is
enormous. The solution of the problem requires the
diligent and earnest study of competent experts, but
it is not impossible of attainment. It is safe to say
the people of California will never accept the con
clusion of Mr. Allardt that hydraulic mining must be
absolutely and unconditionally prohibited. Neither
will they consent to permit the lands of the valleys
and the rivers to be ruined by the debris washed
down from hydraulic mines. It is quite possible to
construct impounding works which will protect the
lowlands and the rivers. If such works have not been
provided in the past, then better work must be done
in the future. That is all there is to the problem.
In the meantime the Debris Commission should take
note of the criticism pronounced by the engineer of
the Anti-Debris Association and see to it that such
improvements as are needed in the dams be made at
once.
From her utterances concerning Congressman
Roberts of Utah it is plain that Miss Helen Gould
does not approve of polygamy. The fact, also, that
she has no particular love for matrimony appears to
be dawning on the many ypung men who have an
eye single to her large fortune.
THE FIGHT FOR THE COMMISSION
ERSHIP.
WHILE the merchants and manufacturers of
California, Oregon and Washington were en
gaged in conference for the purpose of uniting
upon a plan for defending the trade interests of the
coast, and were seeking a candidate whom all could
agree to recommend to the President for appoint
ment to the vacancy in the Interstate Commerce
Commission, the Southern Pacific Company, indif
ferent to the desires of the business men of the
coast and careless of the welfare of their industries,
set about with swift and secret energy to forestall
them.
A petition was drawn up by Judge Carpenter, at
the instigation of W. F. Herrin, requesting the ap
pointment of N. P. Chipman to the office, and
efforts were made in various parts of the State to
obtain signatures to it. The trick was exposed by
The Call on October 15, and the railroad company at
once procured the transmission of the petition to the
President by Senator Perkins. That petition is now
at Washington, while as yet the request of the con
ference representing the business men of the three
States of the coast has not reached him.
This trick on the part of the company is but
another evidence of the contempt with which Hun
tington regards the people of the Pacific Coast and
the sneak methods which he has taught his agents
here to employ in circumventing every movement
designed for the public welfare. The Traffic Asso
ciation of this city, and the organizations of other
cities in alliance with it, designed no attack upon any
of the rightful interests of the railroad. It was
clearly pointed out that what they ask would be of
advantage to the roads, inasmuch as by protecting the
trade of the coast cities it would increase the amount
of traffic they supply to the roads. In fact, every
step taken by the merchants of the three States was
in the direction of harmony of all Pacific Coast in
terests, and it was expected that in this movement
at any rate the Huntington push would not antago
nize the wishes of the people.
It seems to be vain to expect any fair dealing or
honesty of purpose on the part of the Southern Pa
cific Company. It is now clear that as soon as it
was known a movement would be undertaken to ob
tain a Pacific Coast representative on the Interstate
Commerce Commission Huntington determined to
defeat it if he could. He adopted his old plan of
putting forward a candidate of his own. His agents
hurried the scheme through with as much secrecy a3
possible, and would have achieved a complete sur
prise had it not been for the watchfulness of The
Call.
We have in this case something of a repetition of '
the tactics of the Southern Pacific in trying to force j
upon the Legislature the acceptance of Dan Burns to '
the United States Senate. Either the railroad woulJ !
have its own candidate or it would have none. So 'â 
now the railroad agents in the State are out fighting
against the appointment of William R. Wheeler, who j
has been recommended by the business men of Cali- |
fornia, Oregon and Washington at their conference
in this city. They have set forth to beat him simply
because he is a Pacific Coast candidate. They are
acting in accordance with the settled policy of the
Southern Pacific to oppose the advancement of any
and every man on the coast who is not subservient to
the railroad itself.
Such is the situation that confronts the people.
The choice is now between supporting Mr. Wheeler !
or the railroad candidate. The issue cannot be
evaded. Every member of Congress from Californh,
from Oregon and from Washington should unite
with the Traffic Association and its allied organiza- [
tions in urging the appointment of Wheeler. The 'â¢
efforts of the railroad to defeat him should be
promptly met. The fight is on. Once more Call- I
fornia has to meet her old foe, and it behooves her j
people to act with vigor.
THE AMERICAN MERCHANT MARINE.
ONE of the clearest statements yet made of the â 
low estate to which the American merchant j
marine has fallen is that embodied in a recent I
communication to the Industrial Commission at !
Washington by Frank L. Neall of Philadelphia. It j
furnishes a convincing argument for the adoption of j
legislation to remedy the evil by the simple fact of !
making known the full extent the evil has reached.
Statistics quoted by Mr. Neall show the value of
merchandise imported and exported by the United
States for the calendar year 1898 to aggregate
$1,800,000,000. The weight of this merchandise, sent
out of the country and brought in, was over 37,000,000
tons. The transportation across the seas of this
contribution, vast in value and bulk, to the com
merce of the world is one of the chiefest prizes of in
ternational maritime competition. To do this busi
ness Mr. Neall shows that out of a total shipping
tonnage suitable for transoceanic traffic aggregating
27,600,000 tons the United Stotes have a beggarly 125
vessels, steam and sail, with a carrying capacity of
296,185 tons.
That contrast between the amount of our exports
and imports across the seas and the carrying ca
pacity of our merchant marine is sufficient to con
vince any intelligent man of the inadequacy of our
shipping. We are virtually subject to Europe in
matters of commerce. The war in the Transvaal,
which led the British to withdraw a large number of
steamers from the merchant service, has so increased
the cost of transportation on grain and other freight
that we will lose a considerable percentage of what
our profits would have been had we possessed mer
chant vessels sufficient to make us independent.
Our country fronts upon both the great oceans of
the earth and has an expanding commerce in each
direction. It is therefore folly for us to leave the
carrying trade of the seas to other nations. The re
lation which our ocean tonnage bears to that of the
world at large is so small as to be shameful. A very
different condition of affairs will prevail when once
there has been granted to our shipping industries
something of the protection which has been so advan
tageously bestowed upon our industries on land.

IDIOMS OF THE BOERS.
Terms That Will Abound in the Reports of
the Transvaal War.
News readers always suffer Inconveni
ence when the reports from abroad con
tain unfamiliar words and expressions
idiomatic to the locality from which they
may have been written. The occurrence
of such "ultlandische" terms will be fre
quent in the dispatches which will record
the strife between England and her stub
born neighbors in South Africa, for that
country has a patois all its own.
Here is a brief glossary illustrating 1 the
terms which are most likely to find their
way into the war correspondents' ink
horns from the dust of the dry African
"veldt." And this (the comprehensive
term for all open country there, and not
merely "the plains") will do to start
with. Dealing with "de Afrikaansehe
taal," and not with what the "Boers"
(meaning farmers and nothing more) call
"prout holluus" â correct European Duti/h
â we properly spell this word with a iinal
"t," because phonetically the word is in
Africa "felt, even though the books
spell it "veld."
Some people mistakenly connect with
the above word the term "velschoens,"
and spell this, which stands for the farm
er-made skin shoesâ which are only one
degree removed from our moccasinsâ with
an added "dt," under the Impression that
the word means shoes for the veldt.
"UK" is one of the most puzzling syl
lables for the Anglo-Saxon re.adtr to mas
ter; favorite pronunciation is "weet." Its
sound in a Transvaaler's mouth is ex
actly as we say "8" in English, c. g., uit
lanrters "eight-landers." Even In South
Africa itself the Saxon tongue boggles at
this "uit," and for "spruit," a brook or
streamlet, most of them say "sproot";
nevertheless, the Boers always pronounce
it "spr-8."
Some physical features of landscape
likely to De presented to their readers by
the newswriters in "taal" words are
shown In the following commentary:
"Rand," any long, rolling hill range is
a rand; more specifically the grassy ridge
itself of such a formation. Gats rand
and Witwaters rand are illustrations.
"Kopje"â pronounced koppe â designates
Isolated hills, especially such as are round
and have pointed tops. A "kop" is large;
it must be an isolated mountain peak to
attain the dignity of kop. To be a
"spitzkop" the peak must be high, sharp
and craggy. "Berg" or "bergen' signifies
extensive mountain ranges, as the Ma
haliesbergen, the Drakensberg and the
Werzamelbergen. ]

To descend to the lower features of the
landscapeâ say in an the top of Majuba
"kop"â we come down the grassy, rock
strewn "hoojfte," or braeside, and find
OUtselvea in Lraings Nek. "Nek" means
the rounded liolluw of the dip between
any two peaks of a mountain chain. But
do not make the error of confounding the
"nek" with the "pass." Laings Nek is a
pas.s, because the road goes over it; but
there are "neks" which are not passes.
If, however, we were upon a mountain
which offered us no easy "hoogte" to de
scend by we should have to scramble
down some narrow and rugged "kioof."
A kloof is precisely what in America we
call a canyon, and, as with the word can
yon, so also the word kloof may with
equal propriety be applied to a deep, nar
row cut in a plain or a level, narrow pass.
The appointments of the great South
African ox wagon are sure to be referred
to. Of those the great freighters (the
"bokwagen") run to as much as twenty
feet long by seventeen between the wheel's
and are drawn by fourteen, sixteen or
eighteen bullocks, "spanned" in pairs.
"Inspanning" and "outspanning" are
the ai-ts of hitching up and loosing these
animals from the yoke. Each ox is har
nessed thus: After the span have been
"reined" and ranged along the "touw"
the end of a yoke is laid upon the ani
mal's neck, and as there are two stout
pieces of wood thrust through holes in
the end of the yoke these clip his neck in
a fork. They are the "yokeskeys " A
short twisted coupler of rawhide (called
the '"shrop") connects up the under ends
of the "keys." and then it is a clever
beast who can wriggle out of that simple
device. The "reims* 1 with which the oxen
have been caught are around their horns
and as each pair are "yoked" the opera
tor solzrs thefr two reims and allowing a
play of about three feet to the right-hand
ox lays up the slack criss-cross around
the horns of the other; and there you
have the entire harness of the "tre'ek
oss." These "reims" are inch-wide string
of rawhide slightly softened by twisting

Th^y are very strong. w Â» lUI
The "yokes" are fastened along a care

which is called the "treck-touw"â we W
to repeat that the souriVJ of this word
warrants the "ck" instead of the con
ventional "k"â but sometimes a Furo

Congressmzn and Others
Request the President
to Consider Needs
of Commerce.
THE events of yesterday left no
chance for doubt that the choice of
the business men of the Pacific
Coast for Interstate Commerce
Commissioner Is William R. Wheeler of
this city. Dispatches were received from
the Portland Chamber of Commerce, the
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and
the Pacific Coast Retail Hardware Asso
ciation indorsing Mr. Wheeler. Assurance
of similar action to be taken by other
commercial organizations was also re
ceived, among these being the Merchants'
and Manufacturers' Association of L<os
Angeles. The commercial organizations
of San Francisco wheeled solidly Into ill c
for Wheelerâ the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce, the San Francisco Board of
Trade, the Manufacturers' and Producers' i
Association and the Merchants" Associa- I
tion. In addition to these manifestations j
there were others of no less significance. i
Prominent citizens were busied during
ilia day to make it clear that Mr.
Wheeier Is the choice of the entire coast
nnd to get that knowledge to President
McKliiley, who has the appointing: power.
One of the features of the campaign In
behalf of the business men's candidate
was a conference between representatives
of the Pacinc Coast Jobbers" and Manu
facturers' Association and leading offi
cials of the Southern Pacific Company.
The railroad company has favored the
appointment of General N. P. Chipman
to the place left vacant by the resignation
of Commissioner Caihoun. The repre
sentatives of the Jobbers' and Manufac
turers' Association did not in their in
terview ask the Southern Pacific officials
tv withdraw the name of General Chip
man. Indeed, H. E. Huntington and Mr.
Stubbs. who represented the Southern Pa

MERCHANTS TELL HUNTINGTON THEY WANT WHEELER
f\ DELEGATION from the Pacific Coast Jobbers' and Manufacturers* As
*Â» elation called yesterday at the Southern Pacific offices to confer with
representatives of the railroad concerning the securing of a coast represen
tative on the Interstate Commerce Commission.
knowledge that the company had for
warded chtpman's candidacy. What the
business men accomplished was simply to
convey to the railroad people the fact
that the business Interests of the coast
regarded the appointment of Mr. Wheeler
bs necessary. There were ro threats, no
high words, nothing sensatlonaJ.
When the conference clost^d the railroad
peoplo had two facts to think over. One
was that the merchants and manufactur
ers desired that Mr. Wheeler should be
the candidate to represent the Pacific
Coast; the other was that the request
DE VRIES FAVORS WHEELER.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 37, 1899.
To the President, Washington, D. C. :
I beg to respectftlly recommend Wil_
liamÃ. Wheeler of San Francisco, Cal., as
a member of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission and urge his appointment to fill
present vacancy. MARION DE VRIES,
M. C. Second Cal. District.
i came from representatives of the rail- |
I road Qompany's largest patronsâ practi- :
cally every large commercial and manu
facturing establishment on the Pacific !
Coast from San Diego to I'ugt-t Sound.
The merchants who attended the con
ference in the. Southern Pacific offices
positively refused to be interviewed con
cerning the happenings at what must be |
considered a Historical meeting, consid- j
ering all the circumstances. One ot the
merchants said this much:
"We simply urged upon Mr. Hunting
ton and Mr. Stubus that It was desirable
that the Pacinc Coast should be repre
sented upon the Interstate Commerce !
j Commission, and that this couid not be
i effected unless there Is a united support
of some candidate. We bad received a
sufficient number of assurances, by wire i
and by letter, to be aole to Bay tnat all
commercial centers on the coast were
united in advocacy of the appointment of
Mr. Wheeler. We did not go to the con- J
ference with any hostile feeling, and the
discussion was amicable ana friendly
throughout. There were no negotiations
for the withdrawal of the name cf Gen
eral Chipman. No promises wore asked
for. nor were any made. We had no ne
gotiations to inaugurate, for that would
nave tveen unseemiy. We expressed our
wishes and came away."
The Call sent out instructions to its |
correspondents in the interior to inter
view members of the California Congres- J
sional delegation. Congressman Barnaul
is out of tne State. Congressman Need- j
ham had already telegraphed a recom- :
mendation to President McKlnley in fa- I
vor of Mr. Wheeler. Congressman de j
Yries had also telegraphed to the Presi
dent recommending the appointment of
Wheeler. Congressman Waters said that ]
the California delegation would probably â¢
be a unit, and mat no opposition to
Wheeler was manifested, lie was not
opposed to Wheeler.
The dispatches received from the Inte- j
rior are as follows:
STOCKTON. Oct. -' -C rumssmsn Marion :
de Vries to-day added his indorsement to the ;
movement in favor of the appointment of Wil
liam R. Wheeler to the vacancy on the Inter- |
state Commerce Commission. As the sale Dem- \
ocratic Congressman from California his sup
port gives additional weight In that it chows
that Uie business interests of the Pacific Coast
are acting with unanimity In urging Mr.
Wheelf-r'u appointment at the nan*)* Â»l the
President. Mr. de VrlÂ«B sent the following tele
gram to-day to President McKlnley:
"STOCKTON, Oct. 27. 1833.
â â¢To the President. Washington, V. Câ l bey
to respectfully recommend William R. Wheeler i
of B*n Francisco. Cal., as a member of the |
Interstate Commerce Commission and urge his
appointment to till present vacancy.
â 'MARION DE VRIES,
"Member Congress, Second Cal. District."
Mr de Vriea said in a conversation on the
matter: "This '.Â» a move that the entire Pa- I
cific Coast should unite upon without local or j
party considerations. I have therefore Joined
the movement and have telegraphed ray recom
mendation of Mr. Wheeier to the President.
The appointment should come to this coast
and I am hopeful that the strong appeal In be
half of Mr. Wheeler will secure it. The grow- j
ing business of the coast entitles us to repre
sentation on the commission. I am gratified
at the unanimity in which th<Â» representative
bodies have moved in this matter. It Is the
propar way to work."
LOS ANGELES, Oct. Congressman Waters
says: "I have known Mr. Wheeler for a lons
tlma. I have no candidate and am not opposed
to Mr. Wheeler. Before fully acting 1 am j
awaltlner a letter from Senator Perkins, te
whom 1 have written regarding his wishes and
preferences. As far as 1 can Bee the California j
delegation will be a unit upon the selection
from the const and that no opposition to Mr.
Wheeler is manifested."
MODESTO, Oct. 2".â Congressman Needham â 
will support Wheeler. He has telegraphed his j
recommendation to President McKlnley.
OAKLAND, Oct. 27.â Congressman Metcalf '
was seen some time- ago by friends of General
Cbipman and sent Indorsement of Chipman to :
President McKlnley, but Is willing to stand In j
with the State delegation If Wheeler shows
more strength than Chipman.
Senator Perkins and Congressman Loud
have declared that they had no preference
and suggested that a meeting of all the
representatives from the Pacific Coast
States be held and a candidate agreed
upon. Congressman Kahn Is pledged for
General Chipman. The following inter- ,
views were had in this city yesterday:
SENATOR PERKINS â I have not
thought of the Individual whom I should
nominate for a position on the Commis
sion of Interstate Commerce. First, let us
be sure that the President will, fill the va
â  cancy by appointing a Pacific Coast man.
I telegraphed him some time ago asking for
a Western man to be placed In the vacant
position, but have not received an answer,
It Is by no means a surety that the Presi
dent will appoint a coast representative.
My opinion Is that we, the. representatives i :
of the West, meet as a delegation and select
a representative. If we are harmonized I
think the President will conform to the re
queetr, of the Western States.
JULIUS KAHNâ I sent a telegram to the
President when I learned from Mr. Scott,
president of the Chamber of Commerce, that
the West would receive the appointment to
the vacant position on the commission. I
had no choice at the time, but some few
â  day- after while in the Union League Club
I met Mr Chipman and he told me he was a j
candidate for the position. As he Is an
old friend of mine, and not knowing any
other men were in the field, I pledged him
mv influence and my support. As long as
he is out for the position I feel In honor i
bound to work for his selection.
F W DOHRMANNâ On the ground of a i
generally expressed desire that a merchant
Should represent a commercial community :
on this coast, and without prejudice to other :
candidates, who I understand are very es- ;
timable gentlemen, my preference Is W. R. ;
W heeler '
LOUIS SLOSSâ My choice for the office Is :
Mr Wheeler, because he is a man who has ;
bÂ»en rained In that business; because he Is ;
a member of one of the most prominent and ;
reputable houses in the State, and Is In ;
every way qualified for the position; be- .
cause he has had experience In that line of '
business and does not want It for political j :

preferment nor to satisfy a political ambi
tion, but who will accept It for the good he
can do for the coast.
CHARLES HOLBROOKâ Mr. Wheeler t*
my choice for the reason that ho la familiar
with the transportation question and those
underlying principles that control transpor
tation and all questions that would natur
ally come before a commission. His prac
tical experience in business and especially
In rate-making for railroads on this coast
would be of treat value to tho merchants.
He Is a man of a Judicial temperament and
legal cast of mind, and would be able to In
vestigate all these questions with care and
entire freedom from bias and Influences that
would be acalnst the public Interest. Ha Is
thoroughly familiar with the business from
San Dleco to British Columbia, and has
appeared before the railroad officials in
making up tariffs and has given time and
study to the question. We think he would
be much better than a lawyer or politician,
who would not have the necessary experi
ence In these matters. Furthermore, he Is
the choice of the entire business community
from Seattle to San Diego. The merchants
of the north Informed us that their delega
tion In Congress would support Mr. Wheeler
If he were Indorsed by us. There are many
BOARD OF TRADE IN LINE.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal. ,
October 27, 1899.
To the President, Washington, D. C.
Board of Trade of San Francisco earn
estly requests the appointment of William
R. Wheeler of San Francisco as Interstate
Commerce Commissioner. He has been in
dorsed by all commercial organizations cf
the Pacific Coast. He is eminently quali
fied and fitted by experience to discharge
the duties of the office. The merchants
and shippers appeal to you to recognize
their interests.
A. A. WATKINS, President.
K. L. SMITH, Secretary.
other reasons, but chief among them are
those I have given you. Mr. Wheeler should
be err iint>>d.
HUGO ROTHSCHILD-My choice for In
terstate Commerce Commissioner is W. R.
Wheeler. We want a man who is acquaint
ed with the wants of the Pacific Coast, who
knows the commercial conditions, and I
therefore think Mr. Wheeler Is worthy of
the trust. His good qualities and fltneos for
the position have already been expressed In
speeches at the Chamber of Commerce. .
GEORGE H. TATâ I think Mr. Wheeler
Ii the best-fitted among the merchants of
this city to nil thÂ» position of Interstate
Commerce Commissioner. Bit work In our
association has been on traffic almost, en
tirely, and In my opinion he is in every
way capable of fulfilling the arduous duties
of the ofilce and to the entire satisfaction
of the merchants of the coast.
WILLIAM HAASâ My choice, first, last
and all the time, Is W. R. Wheeler. He Is
the man of all others who can fill the bill
satisfactorily to all concerned and who will
be especially qualified to do Justice to all
Interests concerned on the Pacific Coast.
EDWARD PONDâ Mr. Wheeler Is emi
nently qualified to fill the office, and I would
rather tee him of all others chosen to the
position. He has devoted Mr attention to a
study of the traffic question and Is the only
one amon* the merchants who is familiar
with the Intricate questions that come be
fore sue!: a commission. i earnestly hope
he will receive the appointment, as he will
satisfy all merchants.
THE ELECTION OF HORACE DAVIS.
The adoption of the charter liberated San Francisco from the
domination of the State Legislature.
Stratton's primary law destroyed the supremacy of boss meth
ods and gave the people an opportunity to freely express their opin
ion at the primaries.
The election of Horace Davis will be a guarantee that the
charter will be wisely interpreted and Impartially administered,
and a wise selection of commissioners made.
Horace Davis' liberal education and wide experience as sailor,
miller, Congressman and educator have so tempered his judgment
and controlled his ambition as to utterly prevent the use of disrep
utable methods, either openly or privately, to advance himself.
The appointment of the members of the various committees
under the new charter not only requires a man such as Mr. Davis,
but also calls for a vast experience in business and everyday af
fairs to enable him to correctly appoint men suitable to fill these po
sitions, nnd that knowledge can only be obtained by long experi
ence, which Mr. Davis has had.
Mr. Davis' life long devotion to the public school system is an
unimpeachable guarantee that this commission so important and
dear to the people of San Francisco will be non-partisan and non
sectarian, and composed of the very ablest educators.
Every Republican owes it to his party, his State, his city, to
cast his vote for the Republican nominees, at this the most import
ant city election ever had in San Francisco.
E. R. LJLIEKTHALâ As I am one of the
executive committee of the Pacific Coast
Jobber?' and Manufacturers'' Association,
my choice, a* nlso that of the other members
of the committee, Is W. R. Wheeler. First,
because the merchants are entitled to a man
who understands commercial propositions,
and for the additional reason that the Re
publican party and the administration
should give California merchants their se
lection for the position, because the mer
chants of this State saved it for the party
at the last Presidential election.
Claus Spreckels yesterday sent the fol
lowing dispatch to President McKinley:
BAN FRANCISCO. Oct. tl. 18S9.
To the President, Executive Mansion, Wash
ington, D. Câ The Pacific Coast Jobbers' and
Manufacturers' Association, an organisation of
the large mercantile interests of California
Washington and Oregon, In convention In th.s
city, has unanimously Indorsed William R
Wheeler for the VHcancy In the Interstate Com
merce Commission. Petition? are being pre
pared to be forwarded to you. Please awa::
their reception before taking action. I think
the Pacific Coast entitled to this recognition.
CLAUS SPRECKELS.
The San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce sent a letter to the headquarters of
the Pacific Coast Jobbers' and Manufac
turers' Association yesterday, Blgned by
Secretary Bcott, which waa as follows;
I take great pleasure In Informing you that
we yesterday telegraphed to the President In
Washington as follows : ,
"We take great pleasure In Joining with
other commercial â â  bodies of the Pacific Coast
in respectfully requesting you to appoint Wil
liam R. Wheeler of this city to the vacancy
in the Interstate Commerce Commission, be
lieving him to be eminently qualified for the
position from his experience in traffic and
study of transportation."
We also sent the following telegram to each
member of the California delegation at their
home address:
"We have telegraphed to the President In
Washington requesting him to appoint William
R. Wheeler of this city to vacancy In Inter
state Commerce Commission, and respectfully
ask your assistance for his appointment, be
lieving him to be eminently qualified for the
position."
Also notified the Chamber of Commerce of
Portland of our action.
Other dispatches have been sent to
Washington by coast commercial organi
zations In favor of Mr. Wheeler. The
following dispatch was received yester
day telling of the action of the Portland
Chamber of Commerce:
"Our chamber yesterday wired the
President urging Wheeler's appointment
strongly and strongly Indorsing him."
This was signed by George Taylor Jr.,
vice president of the chamber.
Significant action was taken by the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion of this city. That organization some
time since petitioned the California Con
gressional delegation to recommend to
President McKinley the appointment of
General Chlpman. Yesterday the follow
ing wan sent to the California delegation,
signed by A. Sbarboro, president of the
association:
Some time a*:Â© we petitioned your delegation
to recommend to the President, William Me-
Klnley, the Appointment of N. P. Chlpman
to the vacancy In the Interstate Commerce
Commission. At that time we were not aware
that W. R. Wheeler was a candidate for this
position, and we now wish to Indorse him,
as In our Judgment Mr. Wheeler Is peculiarly
fitted to fill this office, owing to his experience
in traffic matters, and th* deep study he has
made of this subject, and that he has the
unanimous Indorsement of all the leading Job
bers and manufacturers of the entire Pacific
Coast who want a trained business man to
represent this section. We respectfully ask
thnt your delegation Indorse W. R. Wheeler
as a candidate for Interstate Commerce Cora
m'sÂ« loner.
Not less significant was a dispatch sent
to President McKinley by the San Fran
cisco Board of Trade, of which the follow
ing is a copy:
To th* President. Washington, D. Câ Board
of Trade of San Francisco earnestly requests
the appointment of William R. Wheeler of San
Francisco as Interstate Commerce Commis
sioner. He has been Indorsed by all commer
cial organizations of th* Pacific Coast. He is
eminently qualified and fitted by experience to
discharge the duties of the office.' The mer
chants and shippers appeal to you to recognize
their interests. A. A. W ATKINS, President.
H. I* SMITH, Secretary.
The Merchants' Association adopted
resolutions Indorsing Mr. Wheeler yes-
terday. This was the first Indorsement
ever given to a candidate for a political
position by the association and was called
forth only by the realization that the
coast needs a business man as Interstate
Commerce Commissioner.
The same exceptional â  occurrence
marked the action of the IjOs Angeles
Chamber of Commerce. A dispatch was
received from A. B. Cass bringing the
news that the chamber had indorsed Mr.
Wheeler.
"Allow mo to say," telegraphed Mr.
Cass, "that Mr. Wheeler has the honor
of being the first man ever Indorsed by
the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce
for any public position."
News was received also that Senator
Carter of Montana has Indorsed the busi
ness men'? candidate for Commissioner.
The sentiment of the Oregon business
men was Indicated in an article In the
Portland OreÃonian of last Wednesday, of
which the following Is an extract:
Important as the traffic Is it Is perhaps
not more so than the action taken with ref
erence to securing a Pacific Coast man on the
Interstate Commerce Commission as the suc
cessor of W. J. Calhoun, who haÂ« lately re
signed. ThÂ« name of William R. Wheeler of
Holbrook, Merrill A Stetson woa presented to
the convention and received the unanimous
support of the delegates from all parts of thÂ«
coast. Probably there Is no man on the Pacific
Cowt to-day better equipped, by reason not
â nly of a knowledge of the details of traffic
but al?o by a thorough understand
ing of Its underlying principles, than Mr.
Since the beginning of this move
ment on the part of the Jobbing centers of th<
Middle West to Invade the territory of the
i'ncific Coast Mr. Wheeler has been closely
identified with the action taken by the coast
to protect Its Interests. As chairman of the
traffic committee of the Pacific Coast Hani
ware and Metal Association he has had charge
i( the Interests of that Important line of trade

H'ircau at Monterey, Ca!., In February, I S9S ;

â vhere the Pacific Coast Jobbers appeared be
:"Â»re the traffic managers of the Northern Pa
'.?.c and the Great Northern railroads, at which
time the argument covering the contention of
:ha coast Jobbers presented by Mr. Wheeler
was one which called forth the wannest praise,
not only from the business community, but
from the traffic managers of many of the
transcontinental raliroads.
The delegates from Washington, Oregon and
California were unanimous In their
support of Mr. Wheeler, who was no more the
choice of San Francisco than of the other sec
tions of the coast. It Is absolutely necessary
to the Interests of the coast that a member of
the Interstate Commerce Commission be from
the Pacific Slope. At present the Commission
consists of one man from New York, one from
Vermont, one from Georgia, one from lowa,
with a vacancy caused by the resignation of
Mr. Calh'>un of Illinois. The member from
New York, without any special effort on hlÂ«
fart, would naturally represent the Interests
ot the New England and Middle State*. The
came Is true of the representatives of other
factions, while the Pacific Coast, which In a
large measure Is an unknown country as far
as Its Interests are concerned, to the Easter*
people. Is without a representutlve. The people
of the const do not want a politician; they
want a business man who has not only a
knowledge of the details and principles of
traffic, but Is also familiar with the necessi
ties of the coast. Their choice has fallen upon
such a man, and the unanimous Indorsement
of go representative a body of men as the
executive committee of the Pacific Coast Job
bers' and Manufacturers' Association Is cer
tainly entitled to consideration.
These are some of the indications of the
earnest work of the commercial organi
zations and of Individual business men In
the matter of having a representative on
the Interstate Commerce Commission wh>
is by training:, experience and ability
qualified for the position. At no time In
the history of the Pacific Coast has there
been such unity. The business men of
Washington and Oregon are ready to do
all they can for the California gentleman
who has been nominated for the Commis
slonershlp. and all State jealousies are set
completely aside. The interest will now
center largely upon the actions of the
California Congressional delegation.
Following: are Interviews obtained
among local business men yesterday:

Funeral of Mrs. Gately.
The funeral of Mrs. Alice Gately, wife
of Deputy Coroner John F. Gately, took
place yesterday morning from St. Francis
Church, where a solemn high requiem
mass was celebrated for the repose of her
soul. Father Caraher officiated. ThÂ» In
terment was in St. Mary's Cemetery, Oak
land. The floral offerings at the funeral
were many and handsome. One, repre
senting "Gates Ajar," was sent by the
employes of the Coroner's office; a broken
wheel was sent by Coroner Hill and mem
bers of the Fire Department sent a beau
tiful floral anchor. The pallbearers were:
P. J. McCormick, John Flanagan, John
O'Brien, James Nelson, Alfred Vlontine

Passing of the Horse.
So soon as nature sees an improvement there
is a chang*. The candle gave way to elec
tricity. The spinning wheel to machinery, the
horse to the automobile. The fact that Hostet
ter's Stomach Bitters has been sold for over
half a century proves Its value. There Is noth
ing to equal It lor stomach or liver trouble.
It Is Nature's own remedy, and the only one
to cure dyspepsia or weak stomach.

FIRST OF THE BIG FOOTBALL GAMES OF THE SEASON.
WITH weekly jumps ihe football
season is rapidly aproaching its
climax, the Thanksgiving game,
that great contest when collegians
Bight of everything else on earth.
This afternoon there will be an Intercol
legiate Struggle on the gridiron, but It
â will be confined to the freshmen classes.
The first football game between the
freshmen Of the universities wrjj played
in the <arly part of December, 1894, and
was a California victory. Since that time |
the games have gone from one side to the
other, the result being, usually. Just what
was not anticipated. The absolute uncer
tainty Of all freshmen games has been
th.jr chief feature and thHr most inter
i silng aspect. Two years ago the blue
and gold was on the books to win with
out the peradventuxe of a doubt. The re
bappened, and In such a way as to
bring untold chagrin to California and ln
effable Joy to Stanford. The cardinal
youngsters piled up a score that was sim
ply terrifying to the losers. Last year
rd was picked as the winner, but
the master hand of Cochran was back of
Hi" I'alifornia freshmen, and they played
;. game that was a surprise, not only to
their opponents but to California also.
For t hi- first time since the Inception of
freshman games on this coast team work
was displayed.
Judging "from form this year, the con
test to-day should be a cardinal victory.
Much enthusiasm has been displayed
QUAIL WILL SOON
DRAW THE GUNMEN
OUT TO THE FIELD
Country Cluh Men and Others
Prepare Against the Open-
Ing of the Season,
The gunmen will scum have their choice
of quail or duck shooting, the season for
the former game birds opening in the ma
jority of counties near here on Wednes
day next. Birds are said to be numerous
and more fully matured than at the open
ing of last season. They have been bet
ter protected. The best of the sport is
looked for in Marin County and other
places to the northwest.
The members of the Country Club have
royal sport in prospect for their nrst day
in the fieldJ Secretary Faymonville drove
over a portion of the club's preserves In
Marin County recently and Is authority
for the statement that birds will be found
there In abundance. The weather cona
tions have been favorable for the raising
of large broods of birds and they all look
fat and healthy. The club lias a number
of enthusiastic quail shots, who always
look forward in anticipation of good sport -
In the field. Among those who will prob
ably be out on Wednesday are: President
Mullins, Hermann Oelrlchs, F. w. Tallaht,
Fred Webster, Dr. Vowlnckel, Dr. del
Marvllle, F. W. Van Sicklen, J. Leroy !
Nickel, the brothers Tubbs and others.
They will leave on Tuesday evening in
their special car and will be in the tield
early on Wednesday.
The conditions remain unfavorable for
ducks and poor bags are still the rule.
When winter sets In in earnest the best
shooting enjoyed in years is expected.
There were few birds near Alvarado last
Sunday and small bags fell to the men
who tried the shooting.
The nominating committee of the Olym
pic Gun Club, elected last Wednesday
evening, is canvassing the material avail
able for the new board of officers. Ef
forts will be made to give all interests in
the club t epresentatlon. Some men like
duck shooting; others prefer deer or
quail,. while .still another branch prefers
the sport to be obtained at the traps.
The desire is to bring these together on
common ground and thus insure the con
tinued growth of the club. H. H. White,
L. D. Owens and A. A. Borllnl, who have '<
done yeoman duty for the club since its !
organization, are not candidates for re
election. They will turn control of the
club over to the new officers with every- :
thing in excellent condition. It is ex
pected the new directors will be chosen
from among the following: M. C. Allen,
George Walker, F. B. Surryhne Dr. --*..
T. Derby. W. A. Marshall, R. H. Dela- t
tleld, J. Homer Fritch, \V. D. McArthur
Dr. S. E. Knowles. A. M. Shields, A. Ai.
Cummings, F. Y. Bell and C. 1-. Miller.
The election, will be held November 8
and it Is not expected an opposition ticket
will be placed In the Held. â¢
The members of the club had fair i
sport last Sunday. Those at the Cor
delia preserve all agree, that birds were !
plentiful but hard to hit. The heavy rain
of the previous week had apparently
scattered the flocks and the birds were
Hying about high in the air. Of the I
Olympics Marshall secured 9; George
Walker and H. F. Rose 8 each; W. D. I
McArthur, 7; S. W. Costello. 5; W. F.
Foster and Titus 3. On Wednesday Al
dimming, 11. B. Hosmer, R. H. Dela
fleld and Theo Kytka were out and en
joyed good shooting.
Achille Roos was at the San Pablo
Sporting Club's preserve last Sunday,
but did not lire a shot. A $2500 levee, re- '
cently built by the members, broke !
owing to the pressure of water which
fell during the storm of the previous
week.
L, V. Merle has grown weary of pur
chasing ducks at so much per dozen and j
is preparing to shoot what he wants for j
his own use and for his friends. Under
the mentorship of "Jim" Markland he
will make his first attack on the feath
ered game next week.
Colonel R. H. Eddy of Montana Is en
joying the shooting over the Teal Club
preserve.
K. Wenzell shot at Mowrles, near Al
viso, last Sunday and secured a bag of
ten birds. "Billy" Schendel secured
twenty, while Charles Cate bagged a
tine lot of English snipe.
A. M. Shields had fair sport at the
Pringle Gun Club's preserve, near Suisun.
The Ibis and Teal Club men had no
shooting.
Frank Maskey will, open the quail sea
son in Marin County on Wednesday.
Jesse F. Ives, F. C. White, E. K. Tay

time telling of a bag of forty ''green

Banos last year without a miss.
throughout the season by the Stanford i
colts and they have worked harmoniously |
with one end in view. Long before Cham- i
berlln arrived the Stanford freshmen j
organized and were playing the represen
tative elevens of the praparatory schools.
Thpir record has been pretty much of an
unbroken neries of victories, and they feel
confident that to-day's culminating bat- j
tie will not be a disappointment.
Conditions at the University of Califor
nia have been slightly different. The ma- I
terial was none of the best and the inter- j
est none too keen. Cochran, while willing ;
| to devot* as much time as could be safely
bestowed upon the freshmen, was averse
to a sacrifice of the university eleven for !
this minor representative team. As soon i
as the freshmen came together and be- ',
gan work in earnest Cochran was there, j
and a great improvement has been
wrought in their playing. The team has
lined up every day during the week on
the campus, facing the strong representa
tive eleven of the university. Cochran
and Kelly, behind the youngsters,
."teamed and perspired as they poured
football wisdom into their willing ears.
Of course, the freshmen of California are
as confident of victory us their Stanford
rivals. At any rate the team is in fine
physical condition, and will do its best
against the cardinal, whose season record
is quite a glowing one for freshmen.
The Stanford eleven will be (he
heavier of the two. Another advantage
the cardinal team possesses is organiza
tion. The eleven has been practically
playing as a team for several weeks
while it is not certain who will make up
the California eleven. The line-up of
Stanford will be us indicated; that of Cal

SAN FRANCISCO AND
SANTA CRUZ AT PLAY
Hot Struggle for First and Third
Places hu the League
Teams.
For several weeks the San Francisco
baseball team has been threatening to
oust the Sacramentos from first place, but
while they have menaced the leaders, \
their struggles have been almost in vain. ,
They have crawled up to the heels of
Kripp's aggregation, but seem to be able
to get no farther. They had a chance to
move up a peg last week and might have ;
done so if a rainstorm had not worked |
against them, a circumstance which i
prompted Uncle Henry to remark that
even the elements seemed to be against I
him. The local team is scheduled for
five straight with Santa Cruz, and
though the Crabs have been strengthened!
by the acquisition of McCarthy and by ,
the discovery of Babbitt's ability to pitch, !
yet the Fliscos seem to feel they have a
better chance of winning a majority of
the series than the Sacramentos have of
defeating the Dudes.
An interesting feature of the series be- |
tween San Francisco and Santa Cruz at j
Recreation Park this week will be the !
reappearance of "Jack" Sheridan as the
autocrat of the diamond. He was a great
favorite in the days of the old Haight
street grounds. Sheridan Is the only man
whose decisions were always accepted
without question by the local fans. Fol

The fact that the freshmen will battle
for championship honors has not de
tracted a particle of interest in the work
of the big elevens. The week has brought
its usual quantum of improvement to the
Stanford team and not much for Cailfor
nia. Chamberlin has about settled upon
the likely candidates, though they are
not yet placed in positions. In another
week it is expected the Stanford eleven
will be organized and then the few weeks
remaining before the intercollegiate con
test will be utilized for team work. At
California Cochran and Kelly have been
engaged in hammering the big eleven
against the freshmen. So far there have
been no changes in the blue and gold
eleven, though the coaches affirm that the
team Is by no means formed and will not
be for some weeks. Whipple is recover
ing rapidly from his strained shoulder
and will be ready for active work within
a week.
The Olympic team has been resting on
its laurels of tie games, still hopeful of a
victory. On Saturday net they will meet
California, and if all the protestations in
which the Olympians indulge mean any
thing they will present a stronger front
LIGHTER AND FASTER
SKIFFS RECOMMENDED
Rowing Commissioner Hlnch
man Will Suggest Challenge
Cups for Championships.
That the recent championship regatta
at Xl Campo did not attract a larger
number of spectators is to be attributed
to the fact that it was not so extensively
advertised as former rowing events have
been and also partly to the fact that there
are now In the board of managers of the
Pacific Association several new members,
who are not yet entirely familiar with the
work of getting up regatta.s. Though the
regatta was not a financial success, the
successful contestants will receive their
prizes. j n only one event, the junior out
rigged skiff race, in which n.ere were four
contestants, will a second prize be called
for. it Is possible that at future regattas
there will 1... no Intermediate barge race.
It is an event that may well be dropped,
for it attracts few or no entries and ex
cites little interest.
At the last meeting of the Alameda
Boating Club, Al Rogers, the boat
builder, was present and considerable dis
cussion . Dsued regarding the proposed
changes in the out rigged skiff. It was de
cided that the Alameda dub would rec
ommend the standard length as I'l'^ feet
the beam being left to the discretion of
the builder. The craft is to be open and
to have at least three laps nearly equal In
width. The skiff at present in use has six
laps; the proposed boat might have a
smooth bottom if the three laps were
placed above the water-line. It was ar
gued in favor of the outrigge.d skiff that
it has been the means of bringing out
many new scullers, who would not have
ventured out in a shell, it is also said
that the shell | s not a practical boat for
ordinary oarsmen, as it is too fragile, and
clubs are chary of letting it be used by
Inexperienced men. The proposed boat
would be substantial, easily handled by
one man and suitable fur the use of be
ginners If a boat of greater length is de
sired, there is the wherry, which is 23 feet
long, while the shell i* .-50 feet in length.
Rogers believes the laps do not retard the
speed of the boat, except at the turn
and there very slightly. To some extent
they counteract rolling.
The Alameda club is strongly In favor
of having three del, gates from" each row
ng club on the regatta committee, be
lieving that the work would be better
done and the interests Âf oarsmen better
served than by one representative. W B
Hinchman, in his first report as Rowing
Commissioner, will suggest that each club
in the association should contribute some
small sum each month toward a fund for
the purchase of challenge cups, which
would be held by the clubs from which
the winning crews came.

ON STANFORD FIELD.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 27.â
The Stanford football squad has received
no special attention from the coaches dur
ing the past week, as the time of the lat
ter has been spent in putting the final
touches upon the freshman team in an
ticipation of to-morrow's game. Several
of the men have been laid off until next
week on account of overwork. One of
these is "Babe" Burnett, who has not yet
reached condition since his return from
the Philippines. Hayden at center has
also been confined to the side lines be
cause of a wrenched knee. Gilman has
returned to the field after only partially
recovering from a sprained ankle received
in one or the early practice games.
Meantime some of the second eleven
men have been given a chance on the big
team, lining up against the freshman
team In these practices Huston and

line Ihe condition back of the line has
failed of any perceptible improvement.
So far only men of mediocre ability have
been tried in these positions, and it be
comes evident day by day that the fresh
man team must come to the rescue. Jost,
who made such a close race for half on
the team two years ago, has not yet had
an opportunity to prove that he retains

Club Will Gather To-Mor-
row in Marin County,
Over at ISscalles, in the country beyond
Bausalito, the men of the Olympic Club
will gather to-morrow In one of the most
notable outings ever planned for the mem
bers. It is proposed to bring together the
members interested in the various branches
of the sport where they may meet
on common ground and become acquaint
ed one with another. There will be no
party lines of cyclers, gymnasts, golfers,
tennis-players, swimmers, but all will be
of one big family.
Captain George James, J. W. Coffroth,
John Cunningham, Fred Butz and others
have been planning features for the out
ing for weeks past. In addition to all
manner of outdoor sport the talented
members of the club will take part in a
vaudeville entertainment. The singers
who have appeared behind the footlights
in the burnt cork and other adjuncts of
the minstrel on many occasions will be
present with their sweetest songs and
with stories guaranteed free from any
llavnr of the chestnut.
There are a number of boats available
to-morrow morning by way of Sausalito
ferry for those who wish to make merry
with the sturdy Olympians on this their
first big outing.
FISHING ON EEL RIVER.
Frank Maskey and Fred Leea have re
turned from the E<>l River country afver
six weeks' iishing and shooting. Mr. Mas
key brought back nine barrels of steelheads
which were preserved for distribution
among his friends. Mrs. Maskey devel
oped unexpected skill with the rod, being
;i Knod second to her husband. She
wound up one morning's fishing by land-
Ing an 11-pound steelhead. With this rec
ord Mrs. M&skey believes she has passed
the novice Mage and the next time she
whips a stream for trout she will have
the best rod and tackle to be had. '.The tish
ing improved day by day while they re
mained at the river. The Quinnat salmon
took the fly readily and a number ol 3
pounders were caught.
A story, not told by Mr. Maskey, comes
down from the north and shows how good
a sportsman that gentleman is. On the
way to Eel River he shot a buck and
shortly afterward three more crossed nis
path. A companion pointed them out to
him, but he declined to try his skill on
them. "Too easy," he replied, and then
mlded. "We have sufficient to supply our
table; leave those for the next who comes
this way."
H. M. [.amlesnerger is credited with one
of the sensational catches of the year.
On his first morning at Eel River he laud
ed with a fly five steelheads averaging
seven pounds in weight. The smallest
weighed four and a half pounds and the
largest nine and a half.
The striped bass have found their way
up to Rodeo, a number weighing from
nine to twelve pounds being secured by
persons from this city recently.
Steelheads averaging from one to three
pounds are being caught near i'escadero

CYCLERS PREPARED
FOR THE CLASSIC
RACE OF THE YEAR
Representative Entry for the
Autumn Handicap of
the C. A. C. C,
The annual ten-mile handicap road race
of the California Associated Cycling
Clubs will be held to-morrow forenoon
over the straightaway course from High
street, Fruitvale, to Haywards. The race
was postponed once, a fortnight ago,
owing to the rain, but the road is said
to be in excellent condition.
There are fifty-six entrants this year,
over one-half of whom have never here
tofore competed in a road event, and the
official handicapper of the association has
been totally at sea as to what time allot
ment to give these men. He has had to
depend upon hearsay entirely, and if he
has been misled in this respect the win
ner may turn up in some dark horse.
Otherwise the men should finish in
bunches, and the scratch men are just as
likely to be in the lead as any of the limit
men. The race will start from Fruitvale
promptly at 11 o'clock, and the riders,
officials and spectators will go over on
the 9 o'clock boat. Club feeling runs
strongly at these association events, and
If the finish is at all spectacular there is
liable to be a good deal of enthusiasm.

COURSING MEN
ARE TO RECEIVE
TEMPTING PURSES
Three Parks Offering Valuable
Stakes for Greyhounds of
All Ages,
The three coursing parks in this dis
trict offer attractive programmes for to
day and to-morrow. At San Mateo Park
the tidbit of the card will be the meeting
of Curtis & Son's Cash and N. P. Whit-
Ing's Minneola, in the final of the inau
gural stake. This could not be decided
last week as darkness settled down upon
the field before the dogs were ready to
run. They will meet immediately after
luncheon to-morrow afternoon. A puppy
stake and an open stake complete the
card.
At ("nion Park some high class saplings
will be run as a curtain-raiser to the open.
stake. The latter has attracted some of
the best of the local dogs and promises
excellent sport.
The men of Ingleside Park have not
been saying much this week, but they
offer a great stake to their followers.
Connemara divides honors with McEn
roe's Australian dogs and those represent
ing the kenneis of T. J. Cronin, U. Shan
non, T. J. McHugh, H. A. Deckelman
and other well-known supporters of the
park.
At the conclusion of the American
Waterloo meeting at Dallas, Texas, offi
cers of the American Coursing Board were
elected for the ensuing term. L. W. Bar
tels of Denver was elected president; G.

The board delegated the control of
coursing In this State to the California
Coursing Committee. All registrations
here must be ntade through this commit
tee, subject to appeal to the American
Coursing Hoard, where any difference of
opinion exists between t.ie owner of the
dogs and the registry officials.
Erwin & Lyons May Queen, which di
vided the American Waterloo with Pasha
Kennels' Emm Pasha, was brought back
by John Halton, who arrived here Thurs
day night. She will be coursed for a time
and before being returned to Texas will
be mated with For Freedom. Silver
Wings comes under the same conditions,
but will be bred to Emm Pasha.
"Judge" P. J. Rellly's imported dog
Plow Boy, which was just rounding into
form, is on the retired list for the present.
He has an abscess on the jaw and in con
sequence will be thrown out of training.
He ran last week at San Mateo Park and
his handlers could not open nis mouth,
the cords and muscles being so badly
affected. He has shown himself to be a
great dog and his owner has the sym
pathies of his friends over this setback
at a time when he gave promise of doing
| good work.

SCHUYLER'S ACT DENOUNCED
Thirty-Eighth in From Missouri Ar
rives From Jefferson Barracks.
Lieutenant Aiken Gets
Sentence Commuted.
The first of the second call regiments
arrived In the city yesterday. The van
guard is composed of the Forty-sixth In
fantry from South Framlngham Bar
racks, near Boston, Mass., and the Thir
ty-eighth Infantry from Jefferson Bar-
Missouri.
The Forty-sixth arrived first, and with
out more ado its commanding officer,
Colonel W. S. Schuyler, proceeded to
make himself and his regiment unpopu
lar, lie put guards all over the ferry
boat Oakland, closing the bar, the res
taurant and the lavatories, which no one,
passenger or soldier, was allowed to en
ter. He also placed guards at the for
ward doors of the lower deck and no one
was allowed, to go out on. the forward
deck.
The passengers were In a fury. They
complained to the captain, who sent his
first officer to parley with the colonel,
but the lirst officer had his words for his
pains. He was told that the boat was
under the orders of the colonel of the
Forty-sixth Regiment and that was all
there was to it. The colonel was good
enough to explain, however, that he
placed the guards around the boat to pre
vent passengers from buying whisky for
his men. There was no whisky on the
iorward deck, however, nor in the restau
rant, but the colonel made no further ex-.
planation.
When the ferry reached this sido of the
hay uo one was allowed to go ashore until
the regiment had been formed and
marched off the boat. Then the citizens
were given their liberty. It was the Ilrst
experience of the kind, and it is probable
that it would have been definitely settled
by the captain refusing to leave the
wharf with another man in command of
his boat, but the ferry had started before
the trouble was brought to the captain's
notice, and there wus nothing for him to
i!o but keep on to this side. The passen
gers have suggested special boats for
reiriments with piratical colonels.
The Thirty-eighth Regiment came In
quietly, causing no inconvenience or an
noyance to any one. It Is under the com
mand of Colonel Anderson. It came out
from Missouri without mishap, but it ar
rived with three measles patients, who
were sent to the hospital as soon as the
troops arrived.
Second Lieutenant William B. Alken of
the Thirty-seventh United States Volun
teer Infantry has been ordered to Manila,
There is nothing unusual about the order
ing of an officer to Manila, particularly
when his regiment Is there already, but
the peculiar part of the order to Alken is
that the last heard of him he was under
martial for drunkenness, and the
decision of the court recommending his
dismissal from the army was on its wav
to Washington. The fact that the deci
sion was sent to Washington is proof that
It was lor dismissal, otherwise it would
have been disposed. of In this department,
and now the orders to Manila Indicate
that something has happened and that
.AikÂ«Â»n has not been dismissed. His sen
tence has been commuted to some loss of
pay and probably the forfeiture for a time

shave. If he behaves himself the second
lieutenant will probably come home a

UNCLE SAM EXCELS ALL
WITH A MODEL TRANSPORT
UNCLE SAM has juet shown to the world that he may be a little slow In the beginning of a war, but that when he
gets started he is up-to-date. In this case he Is ahead of date, and beats the world's record for equipping a
transport that will be a model for the guidance of European nations to follow. The finishing touches to the re
modeling of the transport Hancock are being given at the drydock of the Union Iron Works, and within a few weeks
the Hancock will be put into commission, the finest troopship in the world, possessing, as she will, features pos
sessed by no other transport in the world.
The Hancock arrived here ln August when a board of survey, consisting of Colonel Greenleaf, Major Gibson and Cap
tain Eelcher, V. S. A., and Captain Barneson and Captain Matthews, respectively marine superintendent and supervising
engineer of the army transport service, recommended extensive repairs which were approved by Colonel O. F. Long, the
head of the service for the Pacific Coast.
An additional deck was built the entire length of the vessel, on which has been located the pilot-house, chart rooms,
army officers' quarters and staterooms for the commanding officers and fifty cabin passengers. Between decks an Isolated
hospital with fifty beds and accommodations for nurses assures the comfort of sick and wounded so.^-iers, while a refriger
ating plant with a daily capacity of fifty tons of Ice will serve to render a tropical climate bearable. This plant, at the same
time, produces 600 gallons of water per diem and furnishes cold storage for sixty tons of fresh meat and other necessaries for
the cuisine of a" modern troopship.
An Improved ventilating system has been Installed for forcing pure air through every portion of the ship that 1800

TEE BURCH MURDER.
Manuel McÃride Held to Answer Be-
fore the' Superior Court With
out Bail.
Manuel McÃride, cook on the ferry
boat Sausalito, was yesterday held to an
swer before the Superior Court by Judge
Treadwell without bail on the charge of
murdering Vincent Burch, a waiter, on
October 18.
The witnesses examined yesterday were
Charles E. Johnson, mate on the ferry
boat; John Neild, proprietor of the res
taurant on the ferry-boat, and Policemen
J. R. Dower and H. D. Smith. Johnson
testified to having heard the dispute as j

checking Burch for his- language, Burch
then accused McÃride of being unduly fa

The policemen testified that when they
asked McÃride why he had stabbed
Burch he replied that Burch had called
him an offensive name and accused him of
being on too familiar terms with Mi.^a
Athron.
PRAISES GENERAL OTIS.
Lieutenant Vitale, Italian Military
Attache, Talks of Manila.
LJeutenaut Ferruccio Vitale, Military
Attache to the Italian Embassy at Wash
ington, is a guest at the Palace, having
arrived in San Francisco on. the City of
Sydney from Manila.
Lieutenant Vitale went to the Philip
pines last April to witness the operations
of our army against the Tagalos, and
from that time until last September, when
he left Luzon, he was almost constantly
on the firing line, being attached to the
staff of General Mac Arthur, and accom
panying Major Bell on many of the lat
tfr's dangerous scouting expeditions. He
speaks in the highest terms of the Amer
ican ss a fighter, and the volunteer in
particular seems to have won his admira
tion.
"The American is a ppl^ndid fighter,"
said the lieutenant yesterday. "He is a
magnificent soldier. None better in the
world. The volunteer is especially good.
He Is generally better educated and of a
higher order of intelligence than the aver
ag- enlisted man. These qualities allow
of his doing a little thinking for himself
and he goes ahead on his own hook with a
bravery and a judgm.-nt that is perfect.
"I have no criticism to make of General
Otis that is not favorable. He has the
situation well in hand, to use his own
words, and, in my opinion, Is doing as well
as any one could. It in easy enough to
stay at home and criticize ' him, but it
â¢i be found a vry difficult matter to
pUt up a man in his place who could per
form the duties of a commander in cmef
more satisfactorily.
"The advantages gained by the armies
of America have been substantial and
lasting ones, notwithstanding the reports
to the contrary. The only places ti.at
have not been permanently held have been
one. or two unimportant points which it
was never intended to hold.
'â¢The Tagalos are the most influential
and most intelligent of the tribes in the
islands, but were America to give them
the self-government they want it would
mean that they would have to do to tne
thousand other tribes there what America
is now trying to do to them. This would
mean almost endless war and bloodshed."
Lieutenant Vitale Is now on his way to
"Washington.

Conference With Army Authorities
in Regard to Stranded Soldiers.
A conference between representatives
of thÂ« Red Cross, citizens' executive com
mittee and the T'nited Statea army offi
cials was held yesterday afternoon in the
Phelan building. The conference was
called with, a view of securing relief for
soldiers who have been discharge*! from
army service, either iry Manila or Ban
Francisco, and who are'without means or
transportation to the places of their en
listment. There were present for the Red
Cross Society Mrs. John F. Merrill, Mrs.
F. G. Sanborn and Mrs. Arthur Cornwall;
for the citizens' executive committee,
Mayor Pheian, \V. J. Martin. A. M. Law
rence and M. H. dÂ« Young. General
Shafter and Colonel Forwood represented
the army.
General Shafter Btated that hÂ« would
recommend the discharge of all men in
San Francisco hereafter Instead of in Ma
nila. Tho.y would therefore receive their
pay here Instead of elsewhere and have a
chance to procure transportation before
their money has all been spent. Many of
the soldiers who have been discharged in
Manila have been in the habit of drop
ping whatever pay they received at way
ports before reaching this city. General
Shafter promised to refer all the matters
under discussion to the authorities at
Washington and sea what relief can. be

McKee Rankin, tragedian and theatrical
manager, was arrested yesterday after
noon at the Oakland mole by a" Deputy
United States Marshal, and brought over
to this side of the bay to have his his
trionic pride leveled in the dust, all be
cause he failed to pay the internal reve
nue license for playing Nance O'Nell and
company at a theater in San Jose.
A year ago Mr. Rankin appeared ln San
Jose with a dramatic company and failed
to pay his license. Deputy Internal Reve
nue Collector D. J. Flannery was absent
L n t an Â° ther part of the State at the time,
out there was no law to prevent tr
actor-manager from calling at the inter

uting his share of the expenses of the
war with Spain. On the second occasion
a few evenings ago, Mr. Flannery called
upon the tragedian and requested the
payment of the tax for last year, and also
lor this year, amounting to the ridicu
lously small sum of $17.50, all told The
actor sniffed the air as though the pro
pinquity of the Deputy Collector w^-re of
fensive in his nostrils. When the demand
was repeated. Mr. Rankin made a remark
not complimentary to "infernal" revenue i
people and kindly advised the young man
to go to the infernal regions and to re

JUSTICE TEMPLE ON THE
NEW CITY CHARTER CASE
JLSTTCE TEMPLE of the Supreme Court has handed down an opinion in
the charter case of Fragley vs. Phelan and the Board of Election Com
missioners, in which he concurs with his associates In their findings dif
fering from them only In the process of reasoning by which the oo'nclul
slor. was reached. He states that it was unfortunate that when secUon "
article XI, was amended its meaning should have bÂ»en left in doubt How'
ever, the construction placed on the language thereof by the Supreme Court
has never been modified or reversed, and It justly applies to the caÂ«e under
consideration. In the opinion Justice Temple <>.iys: aer
My views do not require me to discuss at len e th'many matters found important
in the other opinions. I think, however, the constitution authorize the city to fmâ¢
a charter for ita own government by causing fifteen freeholders to be elected lxÂ£ n
pro hoc vice represent the city. It Is none the less the act of the city as \nX
because a referendum !s provided to its constituent members, who, collectively in
corporated. are the municipality. "' ln "
But I think we are neither authorized nor required to determine whether the mÂ«nin
pal elect Inns were duly and regularly conducted. That was settled by the Wi-b,'
ture wh.-n It enacted the charter into a law.
To approve or disapprove a freeholders 1 charter Is especially committed to t*.
Le gl slnu.re by the constitution. Whether ft performs this duty by resolution or by
bill It Is equally a legislative act which concludes the other two departments' If thÂ»
Legislature were to refuse to act at all upon a proposed charter no power eouM
compel It to do so. simply because It Is a peculiar function of the Legislature Tt

VALLEY ROAD
PRESENTS ITS
ANNUAL REPORT
Everything Is Moving
Satisfactorily.
FREIGHT BUSINESS IS LARGE
Passsnger and Frieght Traffic Exce
ingly Heavy During the Last
Year Considering Condi
tion of the Line.
The third annual report of the Valley
road, for the year ending June 30, was filed
with the Railroad Commissioners, yester
day afternoon. It shows the road to be
progressing most favorably and its earn
ings, considering the fact that the line is
only partially completed, are satisfactory
in the extreme.
The report shows that the section of thd
road in operation includes 302.52 miles of
track stretching from Stockton to Bakers
field and' from Calway Junction to Corco
ran Junction.
The value of shares authorized by the
company amounts to $6,000,000, and of this
amount J2.465.200 has been issued. Of the
authorized Issue of $6,000,000 of 5 per cent
first mortgage bonds, to run until 1940,
$5,500,000 has been taken.
The gross earnings of the road for the
year ending June 30 amount to $408,704 61.
The operating expenses amounted to $382,
--552 57, a difference of $26,152 04. These fig
ures leave a net Income and surplus of
$11,979 28, This added to the surplus of
last year makes a total surplus of $177,
--13b 12. During thej-ear it was decided to
treat the road as one under construction
until it should have been completed, con
sequently the entire surplus has been re
turned to the road for payment of bills
for construction.
. The debt per milÂ© of the road amounts
to $27,082 52, and the total amount ex
pended for both construction and equip
ment up to June 30 llgures up to $7,163,
--560 59. This gives an average cost thus
far of $23,679 62 per mile for the construc
tion and equipment.
During the year 81,173 passengers were
carried at an average cost of .02515 per
passenger per mile, and the average dis
tance traveled per passenger was torty
live miles. The total passenger earnings
amounted to $102,316 88.
There have been 135.K60 tons of freight
carried, and the average haul has been
103.66 miles at a cost of .02151 per mile. The
entire freight earnings were $302,976 30.
The road now employs 528 officers and
employes, who have worked 117",031 days
at an average wage of $2,126 per daY
making a total of $248,762 03 that the road
has paid out in salaries during the past
year.
FERRY FACILITIES
FOR THE SANTA FE
HARBOR COMMISSIONERS HOLD
A CONFERENCE.
Plans Presented Providing for Depot
Accommodations for the Trans
continental, Tiburon ana
Sausalito Roads.
A conference was held in the Harbor
Commissioners' office yesterday afternoon
for the purpose of allotting passenger and
freight depot facilities in the ferry
building for which the Santa Fe road has
applied. There were present Harbor Com
missioners Kilburn, Herold and Harney
and the following representatives of the
three roads interested In the proposition:
John D. Spreckels, second vice president;
A. H. Payson, chief engineer, and W B
Storey of the Valley and the Santa F e
roads; J. B. Stetson, president, and \V
P. Russell, general freight agent, of the
North Pacific Coast Kallroad; A. W. Fos
ter, president, and H. C. Whiting, general
manager, cf the California and North
western Railroad and Chief Engineer
Holmes of the Harbor Commission
fn explaining the objects of the confer
ence Chairman Kilburn stated that It was
necessary to provide ferry landing privi
leges for a great transcontinental line for
which the people had been clamoring for
some time. "This road is certainly enti
titled to our every consideration," said
he, "but W6 have Just so much space and
we desire to apply it to the best advan
tage."
Chief Engineer Holmes then presented
the plans he had prepared, which call tor
the moving of the California Northwest
ern or Tiburon ferry to the slip now oc
cupied by the North Pacific Coast road
and the transfer of the latter road to
slip 1 at the extreme northern end of tne
ferry depot, which it formerly occupied
the Santa Fe road to. occupy the slip va
cated by the Tiburon ferry.. The waiting
and baggage rooms are to be so arranged
as to give each road the necessary space.
Presidents Foster and Stetson interposed
some strong objections.
Commissioner Harney suggested that
another driveway be made by taking four
teen feet from the present quarters of -the
PoPtofnce in order to relievo the conse
quent congestion of traffic. No decision
was arrived at, but the Commissioners
after hearing the arguments for and
against the proposed' change stated that
they would meet shortly to take definite
action.
Change in Time on Sunset Boute.
The Southern Pacific announces a
change in the through train service of
its Sunset Route, between San Fran
cisco and New Orleans, to go into effect
to-day (Saturday). It consists in hav
ing the through train for New Orleans
leave at 5:30 p. m. instead of 9:00 a. m.,
and this affects all points on that line
east of Redlands Junction, in Southern
California. Between this city and that
point, however, there is no change.
In the Divorce Court.
Lily J. Vahoahoff has sued Neke'ar
Vahoahoft for a divorce, alleging failure
to provide as cause of action. Josephine
E. Liggett asks for a divorce from Wil
liam F. Liggett on the ground of deser
tion. Frances Grant Gale has sued A.lel
bert O. Gale to annul their marriage on
the ground that the defendant had a
wife living and undivorced at the time of
their marriage.

Judge DaingerfleWl in the case of the
Western Fuse and Explosive Company
against Frederick Kltebauer and some
twenty claimants for damages to prevent
the prosecution of a multiplicity of suits
against the powder company to recover
for losses sustained by the explosion of
petitioner's works at Melrose about two
years ago. Klecbauer was awarded judg
ment against the corporation for the loss
he sustained by reason of the explosion
This case Is now on appeal and the ou
ject of the injunction is 10 prevent the
prosecution of other claims until the
merits of Kleebauer's action have been
finally determined.
Will Appoint a Treasurer.
Registered at the Occidental are General
Thomas Henderson of New York and S.
G. Cook of Illinois, two members of the
Board of Managers of the Home for Dis
abled Volunteer Soldiers, who have come
out to the coast to inspect the National
Soldiers' Home at Santa Monica and to
appoint a treasurer who will fill the place
left vacant by the recent death of Major
Upham, who accidentally shot himself a
short time ago.
The two gentlemen are veterans of the
Civil War and are thoroughly acquainted
with the needs of the home and the wants
of the disabled soldier.
They will leave in a few days for Santa
Monica, where they will look over the in
stitution and decide upon the proper man
to appoint as its treasurer.

11. THE HOME ENVIRONMENT.
(Concluded.)
The Possibilities of a Back Yard.
"Whether in city or country there 1s
great need among us of a better knowl
edge of general landscape gardening, not
on any large scale necessarily, hut that
we may .see the possibilities of any bit of
ground that may como under our control.
All of us may team how. fojf instance, to
plant at the north for protection against
wind and storm, or know what kind of
shrub will best bring out some special
point of beauty in the house or hide some
deficiency. The tiniost back yard then
ran have a tree or a grapevine, a few to
mato plants, even, at the side, a little
space where the children may have their
own garden and plant what they will. A
flowering shrub or two and the shade tree
of apple or cherry may all be In a yard
so small that adornment would seem im
possible. But I have seen such a yard so
planted that it was a spot of beauty, the
area for clothes-drying being limited by
the tenant to the big revolving stand of
lines or wires set in the center.
Building for Privacy.
As a rule this forms no part of the plan
of the average house-owner or rented
There Is a general conviction that such
ground as a house may own belongs to
the public quite as much as to the owner,
and in one sense this Is true. The move
ment against fences which began years
ago had many advantages, and it is only
recently that any word has been said in
their favor. Piazza life, more and more
a fashion, and an invaluable one. Is open
to all passers-by, and grounds are so
planted that the hammock must swing in
public view. Yet a slight alteration in
plan would insure a spot where genuine
privacy and some family life would at
once become possible. The method -hns
been outlined by the same original and
suggestive architect, Mr. Russell Sturgls.
He proves that the house need not neces
sarily face the street, that it can be set
much farther back, and that thp space so
gained can be planted so judiciously as
to make a green covert beautiful to the
eye, yet shutting off observation abso
lutely, unless. Indeed, the neighbors go to
the upper stories to see what is going on.
This would mean, also, a little play
ground for the children, and prevent that
inevitable gathering in the street that is
at present the despair of the mother who
does not wish her children to know all the
chance comers in a neighborhood, at least
till she has had time to discover their
quality. The environment of the child is
at present a matter of serious study, and
many mothers are realizing the danger of
the promiscuous association that has
been allowed and that results in part
from our present system of building and
laying out our grounds.
A New Phase of Factory Work and
the Home.
It is usually taken for granted that a
factory neighborhood must dispense with
beauty and know only the sternly utilita
rian. Here and there mill owners have
shown that this is not necessary, yet
they have found it difficult to secure any
co-operation from their tenants. But
there is one great manufactory in Dayton,
Ohio, where the owner has brought this
about to such an extent that the whole
body of workers have not only beautified
and improved their own conditions at
every turn, but have provided an object
lesson to all outside. Every foot of land
has been made the most of and the whole
effect is that of a delightful park, the
house gardens adding to rather than tak
ing from the general effect of harmonious
landscape. Surrounded by a poorer ele
ment of population the whole general
tone has been raised. Prizes for the best
grown plant, fruit or shrub have stirred
all to emulation, men, women and chil
dren becoming expert in dealing with the
ground they call their ownâ a proof again
of how the earth can blossom when all
are taught to deal with it. It is never
large spaces that are a necessity. The
smallest patch of land has its possibility
and the cultivation of it can be taught
to the 10-year-old child. The sordid ugli
ness that marks our suburbs as well as
our village outskirts will disappear when
such teaching becomes general. The
roughest boy, as has already been proved
in many a social settlement, is happy in
learning how to deal with flowers and
shrubs. There Is a great newsboys' home
on the East Side in New York, the- head
of which believes" floriculture to be a re
generating process, and he has proved
his theory in hundreds of cases. His
schoolroom opens into a great conserva
tory and his boys have in one year han
dled intelligently and sent out over 40,000
cuttings.
111. THE HOME DECORATION.
In spite of the fact that decoration has
now a literature of its own and. that
much really beautiful work is being done
in this Held there lingers still the habit
which came in with the first stir of
thought and interest in this previously
unknown direction, of saying "art col
ors." "art decoration," "art fabrics," etc.
If such things are in existence at all they
must of necessity be art and belong to
to it, just as chemistry, biology, etc., be
long to science. If a color does not be
long to art, then it is merely a stain or
a dye. If fabrics are imperfect and badly
colored art has nothing to do with them.
The artistic sense is in some sort a sixth
sense, bora in fullest measure in the nr
tist, but latent in all and to be cultivated,
like any other sense. For the elder gener
ation this Is often difficult or even im
.possible. For the younger the kindergar
ten gives a foundation and the art train
ing of our newest and highest thought in
education lakes the child from the kinder
garten and in a course of work extending
through several years not only trains the
eye, brain and hand together, but leaves
the_j>upil with an enlarged and perfected
sense of form, color and design. This
means presently a perfected decoration,
from the. lowliest cottage to the most
magnificent mansion or public building;
and tow.ird this we are moving, our quick
adaptlvencss as a people making the pass
age a speedy one.
This Is a complex subject, yet there are
a few simple principles that are of gen
eral application to every building. AVp
have to treat floors, walls and ceilings in
such manner that there will be a feeling
of harmony and satisfaction. The cot
tage is not to hang its drawing room, or
Its cottage equivalent. In yellow satin, nor
can the drawing room In the palace hang
Dp a chromo or cheap print on Its stately
walls. This would seem self-evident, yet
one sees Incongruities as gross In many
n house where the art sense has never en
tered. We have, then, three heads:
(a) Floors, their finish and treatment
(b> "Walls and methods to beautify them
(c) Ceilings and their handling.
It Is worth while to note at thlff point
that the slenderest purse can now com
mand In fabrics and tints for general col
oring a range unknown a few years since
Note also that in this matter of decora
tion women command the situation. They
cannot always dictate where they will
live; they cannot always determine as to
location, foundation or elevation; archi
tecture may not be ordered at will; their
eyes may have to be shut as to some of
the plumbing, but when It comes to the
color of the house, ineide or out, women
*ro supreme. And let Jt be added that
even for those grown up a few lessons in
colors will -teach once for all which are
"cold," whlrh "warm." and why. The
ffTeot on the eye of green versus red, the
meaning of ."â  (complementary colors, the
place. and us.; of harmony, with its sense,
of rest filings, and of contrast, with its
stimulus.:; any intelligent adult can soon
acquire. What art is to the household
and what the household is to art it is the
province and business of the American
woman to know, and women have already
made great advance In this branch of
knowledge. "We take first
Floors, Their Finish and Treatment.
: Let it be remembered first of all that a
floor corresponds to the earth on which
we tread, where, In spite- of 'green grass
in its time, the general tint is a neutral
one, soft browns and grays' predominat
ing. From dark to light is the ascending
scale from floor to celling.. As to floor
covering, sanitation adds' its word to the
artist's command, forbidding carpeted
floors as the . artist forbids the hideous
flowered creations on which a former gen
eration loved to tread. Hardwood has be
come the ideal of finish; tiles, which are
an even more perfect form, being as yet
possible only to the wealthy, unless, in
deed, an English form of mosaic is adopt
ed, broken bottle and china and pottery
of all orders being laid in cement with a
very good effect for hall or vestibule. But
well cared for wood has Its own lasting
beauty, and this care means really less
hard work than the constant sweeping
of carpets. If carpets are used it Is an
excellent plan, where the rooms open into
one another, to carpet in neutral shades
alike for all the rooms on a floor, thus
giving the effect desiredâ the approxima
tion to the effect of the ground itself.
If rugs can be afforded there is nothing
of carpet nature so pleasing to the eye,
while their lasting quality is another ad
vantage. In bedrooms matting can al
ways be used, and the Japanese jute rug 3
will lend the necessary touch of color.
The home of the future undoubtedly will
have tile or marble floors, to be covered
with rugs, since these floors mean all that
the hygienist demands, are beautiful to
the eye, easily cared for and as lasting as
the house Itself. The modern parquet
floor is objected to by the artist because
of its crudely contrasting woods. The
floor, it should always be remembered, .s
merely a background for what is placed
upon it, and this at once puts out of. the
question brilliant colored designs, whether
in carpet or inlaid work of wood or stone.
For cottages denim is an excellent floor
covering and can be brightened by a rug
here and there, but hardwood or Georgia
pine should be used wherever possible.
Stairs require covering for the sake of
avoiding noise, especially where there are
children, and carpets In this case should
be of strong, full colors and without pat
tern, if this be practicable. Patterns are
for horizontal surfaces, not for the Ins
and outs of a stairway.
Walls and Methods to Beautify Them.
It is taken for granted that an intelli
gent plan has arranged wall spaces with
some relation, at least, to the use of the
room. It is only recently, however, that
the thought of the best place for bureau
or bed, for the bookcases of a library,
fqr the sideboard im a dining-room, haa
been any part of the architect's considera
tion. The long narrow rooms of a city
house are a great problem in this way,
a fireplace being often in the center, with
a door directly opposite. The open fire,
which we must cling to for its cheerful
ness, has thus no privacy, and it is plain
at once that the door should be moved
farther down, and, to balance matters, a
piece of furniture nearly its height be
placed at a corresponding distance. In
any really well-designed room there
should be a dado not over two and a half
feet high, finished for all simple houses
in sunken panelings and more strongly
marked moldings. The treatment of the
dado depends upon the furniture of the
room, so that we have again reasons why
the mistress of the house should under
stand what right building means. In all
noble edifices fresco painting, paneling or
tapestry hangings are the forms required
by art. In the average house with
which we have to deal we trust to paper
for effects, and builders choose them be
cause cheap plaster is thus hidden from
view. It would be better in every way
to spend a trifle more on the best plaster
and color the room according to our de
sires. If this cannot be, the cartridge
papers In neutral tints are all desirable,
and even the common brown paper used
by butchers can be used with excellent
effect. But a well-plann-ed scheme of
paneling preserves the architectural lines
and is far better, no matter how simple.
Hangings of any- sort, from chintz up to
satin, are unhealthful dust collectors and
destroy the effect of solidity and per
manency, which is part of the quality of
a room. If possible panel with a view
to the kind of picture that is to be hung,
since the effect of pictures is often de
stroyed by massing different styles of
frames together. Where but a few
simple and fine pieces of furniture are to
be placed in a room the walls may be
decorated with a design. Where the room
is to be like most of our modern rooms,
more or loss of a museum, the walls must
be as unobtrusive as possible.
Ceilings and Their Handling.
Ceilings are of innumerable orders. We
are familiar with the flat one papered or
frescoed. But we are beginning to learn
a few simple principlesâ for example, that
a coved ceiling greatly increases the ap
parent height of a low-studded room. A
he,avy paneled ceiling must not rest on
walls without the coming between of a
strongfy profiled cornice. Wooden ceilings
are coming into favor, but are to be used
only in very high-studded rooms. Plaster
moldings wo are outgrowing, and it is set
tled that we must not treat the ceiling
with wall patterns, since the angle of
view is different. Perfect plaster, well
colored with a deeper neutral tint and a
conventional border in fretwork or sim
ple lines, is the best method for the ordi
nary house. Stenciling can be used to ad
vantage, and the patterns are so easily
done that a good many women have un
dertaken the work themselves with great
success. But simplicity is always to be
the law, no matter what the form chosen,
leaving elaborate schemes to professional
decorators.

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK Oct. 27.â stock market j
made a considerable display of strength during !
the early hours of the day. Later there were ;
occasional advances by individual stocks or
groups, some of "which saved gains on the day,
but In the majority of cases the active selling
movement of the last hour wiped out the ear
lier gains and carried prices In some cases
sharply below laet night's level. The motive
of the gelling was tile fear of an unfavorable i
bank statement to-morrow, as well as to take >
Rttractive profits on the week's advance. The i
high-priced industrial specialties and the Iron j
and steel stocks were conspicuous in the late
r<- action.
The most notable movement of the day was
the rise In some of the railroads running [
through the South and Southwest. The largo !
earnings shown by monthly returns caused the !
movement. The same motive advanced the i
price of Atchlson preferred and Northern Pa- i
cific. The speculation was mixed during the!
grf-ater part of the day, many of the leading j
Industrials drifting up and down at a level '
either side of last night's price. This was
true of Sugar, Tobacco, Manhattan and the
leather stocks. The last named were reaction- I
Cry parly in the day, but preferred stock came
Into active trading late In the day and gained
2H- Other strong spots were Rubber, General
Electrio, Laclede. Tennessee Coal. Colorado
Fuel and Chicago and Eastern Illinois pre
ferred. New York, Chicago and St. Louis pre
ferred dropped over 3 points on a single tran
saction without exciting any attention. There i
were various points of weakness in the minor
specialties. Stocks of companies having to do
with the metal industry were all Inclined to I
heaviness on account of the reactionary tend- i
ency in the price of the metals. The Iron and j
Etet'l storks were not exempt. Steel and Wire I
dropping an extreme 2%, with only a feeble
rally, Call money flurried to 10 per cent with
the late demand for loans to carry over until
Monday .md was quite firm at 6@7 per cent all !
day. According to statements by the leading
banks the net shipments of currency to the in
terior both by express and by deposits at the
sub-treasury for telegraphic transfer amount
to about 12.500. 000. Aftfr allowing for receipts
of a considerable Mini in gold 7rom the assay
office by the banks their loss to the sub-treas
ury still amounts to upward of $1,000,000. To
morrow's statement It therefore expected to
show a loss in cash of fully $3,500,000. Unless
the loan account of the banks has been'largely
diminished It is evident that the surplus re
eerve. which stood last Saturday at only $1,441,
--075, must have been wiped out and a deficit es
tablished.
The bond market eased off later in the day
In sympathy with stocks, but earlier gains
were not In all cases wiped out. Total sales,

Bradstreet's Financial Review.
NSW YORK. Oct. 27â Rradstreet'a financial
review to-morrow will say:
A fair degree of activity and an enlargement
of public interest In speculation accompanied
a further though irregular rise of prices this
week. This movement was partly based on
the rec very of the London market, which in
the eari.- days of the week discounted the pos
sibility of a speedy ending of the Transvaal
war by a sharp advance, in which American
rails shared the honors with Kaffir mines. The
somewhat easier tone of money also lnfluenc ,1
speculation, and Ci nsi.k-rable relief was shown
when it became apparent that the recent rise
In foreign exchange rates was due largely to
exceptional transactions in securities: that no
gold was likely to be shipped to Lundon, and
that the Hank of England and t!ie London
money market recognized that It would be un
wise to create any extra pressure or disturb
ance in the financial situation here. Freed
from this apprehension, and meeting for some
days nt least with decreased demands fnr the
shipments of currency to the interior, the mar
ket for call loans yielded somewhat, the rates
(juute.l on la.^t Monday being 6 per cent or less.
The Increased activity and the advances in
stock prices on the succeeding days were, how
ever, accompanied by a harder tone in the loan
market, the rntes for money promptly ris
ing to above 6 per cent, and on Friday after
noon touched 10 per cent. This was acccompa
nied. moreover, by continued evidences of dis
crimination against Industrial collateral by the
tanks, the copper stocks in some instances
having it appears, been rejected In hank loans,
which can be readily understood in view of the
weakness of that claps of securities. Yet the
stock market was to all appearances more im
pressed by the talk of a speedy return of
money from the Interior to New York, and It
might be observed that lart'e bids were re
ceived for the $2,800,000 of New York City 3V4
per cent bonds which were offered this week,
the average of the bids being over 107.
The money situation was also influenced by
the favorable_statement of the Bank of England
and further decline of discounts on London.
The interest rates, therefore, did not materially
check the bullish feeling, though the industrial
stocks were held in check by the restrictions
which the last of facilities for carrying them
Impose. At the same time Wall street fully
recognized the Importance, from an industrial
stan. '.point, of the Dladng of contracts for
1,500,000 tons of steel rails at the recent ad
vanced prices, deliverable through the year
190 ft. thus insuring the activity and profitable
character of the steel industry of the T'nlted
a for another twelve months. ThPre has
Dot a little frosh outside buying of sto.k-.
even in the better class of industrials, and
commission houses were more of a factor In
the market. At the same time the upward
movement seemed to depend for pun-haslng
â¢ on covering by the short Interest, sup
plemented by some renewed London buying and
by the bullish manipulation which pools and
large operators carried on in various parts <if
the stock list. '
Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say:
A quieting down of distributive trade, mnre
particularly at retail. Is reported In telegraphed
advices to Bradstroet's this week, growing out
of the unseasonably warm weather now be
ing experienced In most sections of the coun
try. Reflection of this is found In less urgent
orders received by jobbers and In somewhat im
paired collections at many points. As regards
prices, however, thaw is no appreciable loss
of strength, the grent majority of quotations
remaining steady, and among those making
changes advances are still numerous. That
the business condition of the country remains
at an unprecedented volume is testlflod to by
the heavy gains noted In bank clearings over
a year ago and by the Immense increases in
railway earnings over exceptionally good re
turns last October. As regards the current ac
tivity in transportation it may be said that
eastbound traffic from Chicago in the past
month has been more than double that re
ported In the same period a year ago, and
twice as large as that reported In October,
18M, a record period of good trade. The ocean
freights situation is gradually Improving part
ly because high rates are attracting all dis
engaged tonnage and partly because the rhe> k
to foreign buying, â  particularly of cereals,
caused by the advance in vessel rates, has
exercised a reflex action on the latter mar
ket. Simultaneously with the drop in freight
rates this week, has come a hardening of quo
tations for cereals, partly the result of this
improved foreign buying meeting the late de
cline and partly also because foreign and do
mestic demand for corn has not as yet brought
out the flood of offerings earlier looked for.
Wheat has been sympathetically strong, tm
have other cereals, and wheat flour has been
advanced this week. Coffee is firm, â  but not
much higher on the week, some speculative
reaction having been noted. Among the leaS
ing products decreasing in price, tin and cop
per among the metals have been most notable,
the latter claimed to be due to production ap
proaching more to a parity with demand.
Cotton is fractionally lower aa the result of
a deadlock between foreign consumers and
American producers. The situation of cotton
goods, one of aggressive strength, is unques
tionably a supporting feature of no small ac
count. The strength of wool is natural. In.
view of the large sales. In woolen goods de
mand Is favorable and further price advances
are predicted. Lumber after slight hesita
tion nt some markets, due to enlarged sup
plies, Is again very firm, as are also hides
and leather, in sympathy with recent advances
In boots and shoes.
The situation of iron and steel Is perhaps
the most notable one yet presented. The feat
ure of the market is the reported booking by
the steel rail mitts of the country of nearly 75
per cent of their capacity for next year's de
livery. In all 1.500,000 tons of rails are re
ported to have been booked for delivery next
year, and there is In addition, considerable
unfinished business' on 1899 account, which it
Is claimed will still further enlarge the volume
of business handled next year. Heavy buying
of pig Iron, to cover some of the rail sales,
is reported In the Central West at prices little
below those ruling for some time past. In all
lines of business demand Is still very heavy,
demand for steel for cars, of plates for ship
building and for wire being additional signs
of Ftrength Demand fir hcrtlware is active
at nenrly all markets. The scarcity of sup
plies noted last week is still a feature and
jobbers nre still pushÂ»,l for prompt shipments.
Br.rbed wire, nails and hand implements tend
higher at some Eastern markets. Complaint
that present high prices are injuring our ex
port trade Is also heard.
Wheat, including fi.iur shipments for the
week aggregate 6.416.1 PS bushels, against 4,160.
--618 bushels last week. 5.660,991 bushels in the
corresponding week of IS9R 5.811,391 hushels in
1897. 3.625.0C0 bushels in 1896 and 2.713,014 bush
els In 1595. Since July 1 this season, the ex
ports of wheat aggregate 69,r.42.1C0 bushels,
ngalnst 67,071.880 bushels last year and 78.283,
--654 bushels in 1897-98.
Business failures for the week are 211 as
compared with 221 last week. 2V.1 In this week
a year ago, 218 In 1897, 246 In 1856 and 299 in
1595. Canadian failures for the week number
21, as compared with 20 last week. 23 in 1838.
29 In IS?7. 87 In 1596 and 48 In 1895.
Dun's Review of Trade.
NKW .YORK, Oct. 27.â R. G. Dunn & Co.'s
weekly, review of trade to-morrow will say
Fears and not facts made a war In South
Africa seem a menace to property here and a
week of conflict has cleared away the fear.
British markets for securities have been helped
by the belief that mining shares would be
worth more with no Boer contrul In mining re
gions.
Large purchases here of ammunition and
meats have swelled the balance due this coun
try. Honey markets hay grown less embar
rassing:, . stocks have gradually advanced, in
dustries are still supported by a volume of de
mand for which no precedent can be found
and payments through the principal clearing
houses for the past week have been 36.6 per
cent larger than last year and 57.3 per cent
larger than In 1892. So great an increase shows
the net business of many potent forces making
fur public prosperity.
The heaviest transactions in steel rails ever
made so early cover 1.500,000 tons for next year's
delivery, or two-thirds of the entire capacity
of the works.
The Pennsylvania is said to have taken 105,
--000 tons at '$33, but all the leading railroads ;
made large purchases and the price was then |
advanced to $35 per ton, the same works hay- !
Ing delivered during Ihe past year at $18 to |
$19. Great contracts for material follow, one j
concern having bought 100, 000 tons Bessemer i
pig at Pittsburg for $23, while 524 50 Is paid for
early deliveries, and 50, W0 tons billets were sold 1
to one concern there and 3n,000 at Wheeling, j
$T>S 50 being quoted, with slabs at $39 50 and ;
sheet bars at $36. Such transactions only sh.w
the general belief that such prices will run far
JntO next year. For structural work many !
orders appear, Including some of consequence j
for the East and for Cuba, and In bars the car |
and implement den and makes the Chicago mar- j
ket very strong, but at Pittsburg works a:ix?aty '
for future contracts has depressed the price to
?2 15, and in plate s.-.me works have nearly
caught up with contracts and are accepting
$2 75. Shots are also weaker, $3 05 bring quoted
at Pittsburg, as the proposed combination
seems to have failed.
Markets for minor metals are reacting, tin
having fallen to $30 62, with recovery to $31 25
on Dutch sales in October, 400 tons larger than j
usual, and lake copper Is largely offered, at '
$17 37. Lead Is a shade lower at $4 67% and
spelter Is demoralized and offered at $5. Coke
holds strong, shortness of cars hindering de- i
liveries, though more ovens than ever before are \
producing.
Wheat remains practically unchanged, while i
Atlantic experts, flour included, have been 12.
-532.841 bushels In four weeks, aeainpt 13,483,056
last yf-ar, and Pacific exports 2,197.771, against '
8,124,806 last year. Western receipts fall short
and in four weeks have been only 30,022,530 ,
bushels, against 40.150.fi09 last year.
Without concert there is probably some wait-
Ing for better prices by farmers.
Pallures l.ir the week are 190 in the United
States, against 226 last year, and 23 In Canada,
against 34 last year.

Chicago Grain Market.
' HK'AGO, Oct. 27. â Wheat opened weak and
alter a feeble effort to cover showed a de
clining tendency for the remainder of the ses
sion. Nearly everything combined to create a
bearish sentiment. Argentine shipments for
the week were unusunlly large, amounting to
1.072.0W bushels. Crop conditions in that coun
try were reported promising, the scarcity of
ocean vessels alone preventing enormous ex
ports. Such evidence of the undiminlshed ship
ping capacity of the South American republic,
coupled with a steady increase in the do
mestic visible supply, â¢ disheartened holders of
long Wheat, who unloaded freely. There was
Kin oonaiderable selling for the short account,
and as the demand was sluggish the market
sagged steadily until near the ond, when cov
ering startod an upturn. The improvement
was only temporary, however, as liquidation on
a heavy scale followed and the market closed
weak within a fraction of the bottom of the
day's range. A slack cash demand and ra
porte of the excellent condition of the winter
Wheat as a result of the recent heavy rains,
stimulated the selling movement. December
opened %<SV*c lower at 70%@70%c, touched 70%
@70%e, declined to 70V.C and advanced to 70% c
and declined to 70% cat the close.
Corn was strong and active early, but event
ually weakened under liquidation, encouraged
by an estimate by an authoritative statistician
that "the total yield would amount to '2,200,000,
--000 bushels instead of 2,000,000,000 as predicted
by the Government bureau. A disappointing
poor cash demand was also against the mar
ket, but country buying owing to wet weather
and moderate receipts prevented any important
break. December closed with buyers at 31%e.

The next witness called was Hans Han
son, who discovered the body of the mur
dered child.
"I lived on Sheep Island about two
years and a half and worked for Mr.
Baggo," he testified. "I think Mrs.
liaggo killed her child and then drowned
herself."
Baggo, the father of the child, stated
that he had been married about ten
years. "I saw my wife last Saturday In
Oakland," said he. "I went to see a
lawyer to turn my property over to her,
because we could not agree and had con- I
eluded to separate. Anna Rosa Baggo, i
the child, was born in San Francisco
about nine years ago. My wife seemed
to be of sound mind, and wherever she
went she would take the child with her."
Other witnesses testified to finding the
';â¢' â¢â !â !â  of the murdered child and the search
for the mother, but none of them could
throw any light on the crime.
Tli, father of the child broke down on
the witness stand.
The jury returned a verdict that Anna
Rosa Kaggo met death at the hands of
her mother.

BABY'S HAND IN PAPA'S
SOUP CAUSED A DIVORCE
OAKLAND, Oct. 27.â The simple fact of a baby jabbing Its plump little
hand into papa's soup one supper time last January while mamma
was pouring out the broth and holding; baby at the same time was tiie
primary aad alleged overt act warranting the declaration of domestic
war between Hprman Dinslage and his pretty young wife, Mary, the
trial of whoso divorce suit, brought on the ground of cruelty, was commenced
to-day before Superior Judge Greene.
"I couldn't very well pour the soup with ihe baby in my arm," said the
young wife on the witness stand this afternoon, "and I had asked my hus
band :o take the child, but he refused. The baby didn't scald its hand and
no one was hurt until afterward my husband, RtlH angry over the affair.
grabbed me by my wrist, drawing- blood. Then he bit me and abused me.
"The next day the fuss was kept up. My husband finally told me I could
go and take all the furniture, because I had complained about his brother
boarding with us and because I would no longer do the brother's washing.
That night when my husband came home I waa prying in the kitchen and
he askrd why supper was not ready. 1 told him his brother had carried oti
the back ii"'>r key. The brother called me a liar and then they told me
that I came from a degraded family.
"Finally when I told them that I was surely as good as themselves the
brother grabbed me by the throat and threw me against a trunk. Next day
I took half the furniture, leaving what I thought my husband might need,
and went to my mother's house. That was la si January and he has never
called on me or baby since then. Frequently my husband would not speak to
me for days. He would talk German to his brother at the table and I
couldn't understand what they were saying.
"The first disagreement occurred over a game of casino at his mother s
home in Paso Robles, three days after our marriage, which game I claimed
wasn't being played according to Hoyle."
To-morrow the defense will put in its testimony.

name of Flint, Dearborn &â  Co. and would
operate their sailing ' vessels from New
York and Philadelphia to Pacific Coast
ports in connection with the four new
steamers of the ; American -Hawaiian
Steamship Company. It was suspected,
however, that a fair offer for the sailing
vessels would not be 'refused, but no one
expected to Bee all ten ships come to San

JEANETTE HOME RICH WITH
SPOILS FROM THE ARCTIC
THE steam whaler Jeanette arrived from the Arc
tic yesterday, after the most successful cruise of
the season. She left here last January, but dur
ing the interval the crew succeeded in taking
eighteen whales, or a few less than all the rest of
the fleet combined. The eighteen leviathans yielded
34,000 pounds of whalebone, valued at. in round figures,
?â â¢â¢""'â â ""
The Jeanette was docked as quickly as possible and
the cargo unloaded. The whalebone will be shipped Bast
at once, and from New York will go to France. At
Lyons and othÂ»r French manufacturing centers it will
be made Into threads and joined' with silk will be turned
Into the stiff silk dresses that come to San Francisco
and cost so much money.
Captain Newth of the Jeanette reports the Karluk
with 4, Thrasher 4, Bowhead 5, Mermaid 2, Alaska 1.
William Baylies 2, Belvedere 3 and Alexander 2 whales.
Captain Mckenna in the F.-arless did not catch a whale.
He is going to winter at Herschel Island, while the
Grampus, Balaena and Narwhal will winter at Capo
Bathurst. The Thrasher has lost a half of one of the
blades of her propeller and will be a few days late mak
ing port. The rest of the fleet is now hourly expected.
FraJik Smith, one of the crew of the Jeanette, died in
August last of consumption and was buried at sea.
CRIMSON LETTERS WOULD HAVE TOLD THE TALE
Headed by Jacob Oppenheimer, Convicts in the Incorrigible Ward at San

UKDAtTNTED by the failure of!
their conspiracy to garrote

leave the story of their escape
from San Quentln Prison written ;
| In letters of blood on the floor of the old ,
j factory building, the desperate convicts I
confined in the incorrigible cells have for j
five weeks been laying new plans to ;
' escape â plans so clever !n formation and
I detail that the prison officials are filled
; with amazement and horror; amazement â 
! at the indefatigable efforts of these dcs- ;
| perate criminals to regain their liberty In
] the face of obstacles generally regarded
!as insuperable, and horror at- the awful
â  mrnage that would have resulted had the
j plot been carried out without a hitch.
Jacob Oppenheimer, the (Tend, who
! stabbed Guard James McDonald in
the Jute mill on May 16 last and inflicted
wounds which almost resulted fatally,
was selected as the Napoleon to lead them
\ forth to freedom, and the fact that Op
' penhelmer rupented of his leadership In
a straitjacket until 6 o'clock last even
j ing was not doo to his own desire or in-
I tentlon. but to the vigilance of Guard J.
( D. Jones, who first came Into prominence
! by serving on the death watch over W.
i H., T. Durrant. For five weeks the run
ning "incnrriKibles" have been at work
perfecting their plans and procuring the
I material necessary for the expected
! break. Last night they took the Initial
: step toward carrying out their awful
: plans.
For more than a month Oppenhclmer
has been Biipplied weekly with three
copies of the Christian Advance and Vol
unteers" Gazette. Before he returned each j
: copy the convict removed the inner sheet, ;
! and In five weeks' time had accumulated
! fifteen of these inner sheets. One of these
was made Into a tube, another into a
1 smaller tub*, which would fit into the
hr^t, and so on until a paper tube eleven i
feet lone had been prepared, the points
: where the sections were joined being
made secure with thread.
About 8 o'clock Thursday evening, while
Guard Jones was in the small room at the ,
rust end of the upper floor of the factory ,
building, about thirty feet away from the
tier of Incorrigible cellsâ Barwell being;
â  absent at supper â Oppenheimer thrust <

RIGHTS OF THE WIFE.
Riverside Conspiracy Case in the Su-
preme Court.
Mrs Eleanor Hart of Riverside County
brought an action fipnlnst her husband,
Elton Hart, and Katherlne A. Church to
compel the cancellation and surrender of
a mortgaKe In the sum of $T.ipi'Â«O upon the
plaintiff's homestead. The circumstances
of the trouble are peculiar. In 1^94 Hart
took the Church woman to his home and,
according to the complaint, bestowed upon
her the attentions dne only to the wife.
Mrs. Hart charges that while she was
sorely troubled in mind and ill Hart and
the Church woman, by threats and in
timidation, compelled her to sign a note
for SSOOO and secure the payment thereof
by K'vinp a mortgage on the homestead.
In the lower court Mrs. Hart won, but in
the- higher court, to which the oa.Â«e was
appealed, the judgment was modified. The
Buperior Court sustained the part direct
ing the caii'-ellatlon of the mortgage, on
the ground that the instrument was not
executed Jointly and concurrently by the
husb.-ind and wife. The husband did
Blgn and acknowledge a statement that he
Joined with his wife in incumbering the
property, but not until five months after
she had been induced to sign the mort
gage. This made it Invalid, because it did
not comply with the code. As the com
plaint did not aek for the rescission and
cancellation of the note, which the lower
court directed, this part of the first order
was reversed.
John Satchwell's Will.
The will of John Satchwell, who died on
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1899.
Captain Newth confirms the report brought by Cap
tain Bodfish about the mortality among the natives.
When the Jeanette was at Cape Smyth there had been
thirty-eight deaths from a dise ase resembling pneumo
nia. One family, consisting of a father, mother, son,
daughter-in-law and three children, all died of the mal
ady Inside of five days. Nothing can be done to stay thÂ»
ravages of the disease, and as soon as a native Is taken
sick he simply gives up and dies in a few days.
The Ksquimaux at Cape Prince of Wales discovered
gold In large quantities in one of the creeks. They tried
to keep the secret to themselves, but it leaked out and
there was a rush of gold hunters to the place when the
Jeanette was there. Captain Newth also says that he
heard that both placer and quartz mines had been dis
covered in Kotzebue Sound. The whaling bark Ala-ska
is fitted out for carrying passengers, and Captain Cogan
intends stopping at Cape Nome on the way down to
bring down all the miners who want to come home.
The Jeanette Is now at Howard street wharf, but as
soon as she is discharged will go over to Oakland Creek
and lie up for the winter. In the spring she will go
back to the Arctic. This year Captain Newth was first
to the eastward and on the home, run was first to the
westward. To this fact he attributes his good luck, and
next year will try the same tactics.
said, the convict immediately compiled
with the order. Warden Agulrre was sent
for and asked Oppenheimer what he had
done such a thing for.
"Well," was the surly reply, "if I tell
you you will know as much about it as
I do."
The Warden sent Jones for a strait-
Jacket without any loss of time and placed
the intractable criminal in this Instru
ment of torture. At 3 o'clock yesterday
afternoon Oppenhelmer's spirit was
broken sufficiently that he sent for
Aguirre and declared that his craving for
a smoke was more than he could endure
and he had taken that means of securing
It. Ajtulrre laughed and asked Oppen
heimer If he expected to smoke the mat
treÃS. Seeing he. was cornered, the man
broke down completely and confessed to
the Warden a tale of Intended murder
and escape so terrible In circumstantial
detnll that even the head of the prison,
with all his dealings with the criminal
class, was dumfounded. After tilling
about taking the inner pages out of the
religious paper and making the tube Op
perihoimer'B tale, was as follows:
"My Intention, according to the plan,
was to set fire to my mattress and pass
the burning tube along to a few others of

A "Fake" Printer.
The police were notified yesterday by

that a man was soliciting money for the

of ape. medium height and has v black
mustache.
You never have a head In the morning from
drinking Jesae Moors' "AA" whiskey. Try It.
, fierce we were to huddle against the doors
! of our cells and yell 'flre,' to get Jones to
! come and unlock the cells In order to save
us from being cooked alive. We felt con
fident that In the flurry and excitement
attending the affair his humane feelings
would cause him to do this. Then we
would have waited till three or four of
the 'boys' were released and fallen upon
him and killed him, or rendered him in
sensible at least. Afterward he would I
have been placed in a cell, the fires ex- ;
tlnguished, tho others released with the j
keys which we knew Jones carried, and j
when Harwell returned it would have j
been an easy matter to put him out of tho
way.
"When It was very dark we would have
slipped nut quietly and waylaid Sergeant
of the Night Watch Ellis and his seven !
men separately and knocked them out
with bludgeons. Securing their clothes
nnd weapons and keys we would have re
leased a few of the most desperate prls
! oners and set flre to one of the buildings
;In the southern part of the yard. When
the flre blazed high and the guards on
; the wall ran around there we would have
instructed the mon last released to rush
; over the west wall, and while the guards
I were shooting at thÂ«m we could have
i easily escaped unnoticed over the north
wall."
Oppenholmer was asked if he did not
1 realize that some of the men going over
the west wall . would be killed. He
laughed ajid said the convicts in the in
' corrigible ward had a club of common
I commiseration and sympathy formed and
didn't care for the rabble of prisoners
anyway.
Oppenhelmer was released from his
straightjaoket last night and with tears in
his eyes said he would make no more at
tempts to escape. He said he had all he
wanted of Aguirro and should have taken
j warning from the case of "Sir" Harry
Cooper and Morroll. All the other convicts
j in the incorrigible ward denied that they
I were concerned in the plan, and as there
was no proof that they were except the
word of Opponheimer they were allowed
to go unpunished.
"Here- is a case," assertod Warden
Agulrre last evening, "where these incor
! rlgll'le follows have tried to escape within
; a fow weeks of the time when two of their
i number were punished .severely for the
j very same thing. Now 'Sir' Harry, Mor
! rell and Oppenheimer have all been quiet-
I ed and will stay that way. With these
restless spirits rendered tractable, we an
ticipate no further trouble In that quarter.
Yet there are people who rail against the
Incorrigible cell system, and would have
such convicts as those permitted to roam
about where their chances of working evil
would be Increased a hundred fold."
Captains Russell and Edgar both be
lieve there will be no more trouble In the
Incorrigible ward for some time to come.
Guard Jones, to whose vigilance Is por-
I haps dup the lives of ton mon, has been
: tlirinkod by tho Warden and by Prison Di
rector Wllkins for his devotion to duty.

DARING CHINESE
BURGLAR LOCKED
IN THE TANKS
Ex-Convict Ah Loui
Captured.
POLICE NO LONGER PUZZLED
Taken Into Custody After Making
an Unsuccessful Attempt to En-
ter a Fashionable Resi
dence.
Safely locked In the tanks at the City
Prison is Ah Loui, a desperate Chinaman
whom the police believe is .responsible for
the series of daring burglaries that have
been committed in the Western Addition
during the last few nights. The wily
Mongol was arrested last night by Special
Policeman Dailey and Policeman Whelan,
Just as he was leaving a fashionable resi
dence on California street, where he had
made an unsuccessful attempt to force
the front door open with a jimmy.
Ever since' the series of burglaries that
have puzzled the police were successfully
committed the officers in the western por
tion of the city were given orders to be
especially vigilant and arrest all suspi
cious characters seen hovering about their
beats. Shortly after 8 o'clock last even
ing Special Dailey and Officer VVhelaji no
ticed the Chinaman skulking in the dark
shadows close to the edge of the sidewalk
and they stood across the street and
watched him.
In a few moments Ah Loui disappeared
up the stairs of a residence close by and
remained at the door several minutes.
Then- he came hastily downstairs and
started to run up the street. The officers
chase and soon captured him. When
! placed under arrest the Chinaman became
j ugly and defiant and protested that his
only object In visiting the house was to
sell lottery tickets. As an evidence of
good faith the prisoner reached under his
blouse and drew forth a wad of Chinese
lottery tickets.
Policeman Whelan left Ah Loui in
charge of the special officer and went
back to the residence the Chinaman at
tempted to enter. There he ascertained
that he had not rung the bell but at
tempted to force the door v.-lth a jimmy.
The occupants of the house heard the
sounds and started toward the front door,
thus frightening him off.
The prisoner was taken to the f'ltv
Prison, where he was thoroughly searched
by his captors, assisted by several detec
tives from the upper office. On his per
i son were found a complete set of burg
! lars' tools, including a Jimmy and a skele
ton key of unusually fin^ make. The key
was concealed in the sole of his stocking.
During the searching process one of the
detectives identified Ah Loui as an ex
convict and a clever Chinese crook wno

With Mrs. Carleton Crane's
Gems.
Ah Sing, an alleged diamond thief, who
professes to be a Chinese cook, was ar
rested last night by Detectives Wren and
Dlnan and taken to the City Prison,
where he was placed in the tanks;
Carleton C. Crane, the well-known local
agent for the Vanderbllt lines, had abso
lute faith In Ah Sing's honesty and ability
and last Monday employed the. Chinaman
as a cook and sent him to his country
residence at Verona, near Nlles.
On Wednesday Ah Sing complained of
feeling 111 and he asked permission to
come to the city.
Mrs. Crane granted the desired pprmlp
slon. When dinner time arrived and Ah
Sing did not return, Mrs. Crane became
suspicious and began to search the house
to sf-e if anything was missing. She went
to her Jewel case first and found that six
elegant and costly diamond rings had been
stolen.
The matter was at once reported to
Chief T^ees and he detailed Detectives
Wren and Dlnan to apprehend Ah Sing.
The Chinaman was found hiding In a
Chinese store pn Commercial street, but
the stolen Jewelry was not found on his
person.

tions as the New York. Boston and Chi
cago athletic clubs, and from such other
clubs as may provide the material we
desire, will be represented. This will be
followed by a revival of wrestling, catch
as-catch-can style, on the same lines as
the other.
"The internal changes in the Olympic
Club will be the building of a ball court
and a rearrangement and remodeling of
the bathing facilities. What I particu
larly desire is the building up of the juve
nile and Junior classes, which, have al
ready begun to take a spurt; and the in
creasing in every direction of the personal
comfort of members. In order that every
member shall feel he is getting the full
value of his investment the present board
of directors aspire to give frequent ath
letic exhibitions.
"In regard to the tone of the club, it
has Improved very materially of late, as
the board of directors have determined to
retain in the club only those who can be
have as gentlemen. The increase in dues
caused a number of resignations, but the
gap has been more than filled by the re
turn of old and the election of new
members. Already the classes are very
much enlarged. The salaries of the teach
ers have been Increased and their hours
of labor largely extended. The club is on
the up-grade and every one interested in
the advance of athletics on this coast is
helping It on."
A great part of Mr. Harrison's time in
New York was spent on board the Erin,
as the guest of Sir Thomas Llpton. Of
Sir Thomas he said:
"He is a generous host, affable compan
ion and keen sportsman. One of his many
good qualities is that he never forgets his
friends. Almost the first words he said
when I met him were to inquire after his
old friend, Mr. Pollok of the Palace Hotel,
to whom he desired to be warmly remem
bered."
In company with some of Sir Thomas'
guests. Mr. Harrison viewed the great
naval parade in Dewey's honor. He pro
fessed himself greatly disappointed, as it
did not approach in spectacular effect the
recent one in San Francisco; neither
could the Illuminations, on the night of
the land parade, compare with those
which we provided to welcome the First
