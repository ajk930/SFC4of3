The Secretary of State for War left Mr.
Choate's residence immediately after the ban
quet to Generai Harrison and proceeded to the
War Office, where, even after midnight, there was
considerable activity, many visitors calling vo in
quire for information, among them a sister of
Sir Archibald Hunter.
Following is the dispatch from General Sir George Stewart
White to the Marquis of Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War,
which was received last evening at II o'clock and posted at the
War i )ffice soon after midnight:
"LADYSMITH, Oct 24, 9 p. m. â Information received
yesterday showed that the Boers had established themselves in
rable numbers in an exceedingly strong position west of
the main road leading from Ladysmith to Dundee. 1 also had
information that the Dundee force, formerly commanded by Gen
eral Symons, and since his wounding' commanded by General
Yule, was failing back on Ladysmith by way of the Helpmak
karr road, Beith and the valleys of the Waschbank and Sunday
rivers, and was expected to report at .Sunday River Valley to-
I therefore moved out with a strong force to cover the
movement of Yule's column. The enemy was discovered about
seven miles out of Ladysmith in a position of great natural
strength, west of the road. When he saw that preparations were
being made against him he opened fire with one gun with great
'icy.
"1 >ur artillery soon got into position and the gun was si
lenced. Our troops were ordered to occupy a strong ridge, pa

irts to occupying him and hitting him hard enough to pre
vent his taking action against Yule's column. Numbers of the en
emy fled to the west and the firing had practically ceased at 2

SITUATION IN NATAL
IS YET DISQUIETING
London Papers Criticize Wolseley's Summary
and Compare It to Statements Made by the
Spanish When Santiago Fell.
LONDON, Oct. 24.â The British
military authorities hope tohavo the
wireless telegraphy In operation In
South Africa within three weeks,
when, it is hoped, the difficulties ex
perience from the cutting of wires
will be obviated, as it will only be
â ry to establish communica
tion with a point where the ordin
ary wires are intact.
LONDON. Oct. 24.â The Parliamen
tary Secretary of the Foreign Of
fice, George Wyndham, In the
House of Commons to-day an
nounced that Field Marshal 'Lord
Wolseley, the commander In chief of the
forces, sums up the situation In Natal to
day as follows:
"General Yule has fallen back to effect
a Junction with Sir George Stewart White.
He camped yesterday evening about six
teen miles south of Dundee, without see
ing anything of the enemy during the
march, and it has since been reported
that 'aH'3 well on the Waschbank
River.'
"General White fought a successful ac
tion with the Orange Free State force to
day on the road betweeen I>adysmith and
Newcastle and should join hands with
General Yule this evening. General Yule
reports that his wounded are doing well.
The Hoer wounded on our hands are
treated just as our own and I have every
reason to believe the Boers will treat any
of our wounded in their hands In a simi
larly humane manner."
Mr. Wyndham added: "I may remind
the House that the Transvaal Is a party
to the Geneva convention."
Lord Wolseley further says:
"I have also received from General
Walker at Cape Town the following mes
sage: 'The last message from Klmberley
October 22, at 2 p. m., reports all well.' " *
Replying to a quesuon as to what ar
rangements had been made to employ
civilian doctors to assist In the care of
the wounded in South Africa, Mr. Wynd
ham said he was glad to take the oppor
tunity of announcing that Sir William

of the Royal College of Surgeons, had In
timated his readiness to accompany Gen
eral Sir Redvers Buller's force and place
his great skill and ability at the disposal
of the army medical authorities. Mr.
Wyndham said: "We have not hesitated
to accept this patriotic offer."
The War Office this morning attempted
to explain the summary of the situation
In Natal, furnished by the commander in
chief of the forces. Field Marshal Lord
Wolseley, to the House of Commons yes
terday. His statement Is now said to
have created unnecessary alarm and it is
asserted that what the official note called
General Yule's "retirement" would bo
more accurately described as a "change
of position for tactical reasons," and that
the alarm for the safety of the wounded
is not justified. It is further explained
that the wounded could not be moved,
but the fact that they had to be left to
'their fate while the British forces .made a
strategic movement to the rear shows the
suspense of the House at the absence of
subsequent news is amply justified and
that the heavy fighting on Friday and
perhaps Saturday is perhaps a prelude to
still sterner work. In some quarters the
view is taken that the second attack of
the Boers has actually occurred and was
so successful that General Yule's with
drawal was imperative and urgent to the
extent of compelling him to leave his hos
pitals in the hands of the Boers, while
the more sanguine express the opinion
that General Yule, far from retreating,
has in reality advanced to meet the at
tack threatening Glencoe, leaving Dundee
behind, safely sheltered from a Boer
assault.
In the absence o{ authentic news, there
are a number of contradictory rumors
afloat, but the most reasonable interpreta
tion of the various reports seems to indi
cate that there was some artillery prac
tice at Glencoe Saturday and Sunday, but
no fighting at close quarters.
As, however, communication between
Glencoe and Ladysmlth, which was
thought to have been restored by the Brit
ish victory at Elands Laagte, has again
been broken by the destruction of the
railway bridge at Waschbank, north of
Ladysmlth, and between Elands Laagte
and GJencoe, the difficulties of the British
commander- in Natal, General Sir George
Stewart White, in reinforcing Glencoe
have been enormously Increased, and un
THE BATTLE OF ELANDS LAAGTE.
til the British forces at Ladysmith and
Glencoe are reunited and the main body
of the Boers is brought up, the situation
must remain disquieting for the British.
The afternoon papers here sharply criti
cize Lord Wolseley's summary of the
Natal situation. They say it has a dis
tinct resemblance to the statements of the
Spanish Ministry when preparing their
countrymen for news of the disaster at
Santiago. This, however, is probably an
overstrained view. There is no denying,
however, the great suspense and anxiety
existing, which has been increased by the
report in circulation, purporting to eman
ate from official quarters, to the effect
that the Boers have secured the services
of 13,000 natives.
The vague and varied estimates of Boer
losses and the absence of any official in
formation on the subject are also arous
ing misgiving's as to whether the beaten
enemy suffered proportionately to the dis
astrous losses of the victors. One of the
most disquieting stories comes from Lady
smith. It is to the effect that an English
man, who arrived there from Dundee on
Sunday evening, after escaping through
the Boer lines on the previous night, said
the enemy was then shelling the camp
and town with heavy guns, while the
shells of the British were unable to reach
the enemy's batteries. Consequently, the
man is said to have added, the camp was
shifted a mile or so. In order to be out
of the reach of the Boers, who were firing
on the magazine in the town.
News has at length been received direct
from Colonel Baden-Powell, dated Mafe
king, October 15. It confirms the state
ment that In the armored train fight the
British had two men killed and fifteen
wounded, including- Lieutenant Lord
Charles Benedict of the Ninth Lancers,
slightly wounded. The Boer loss was es
timated at fifty-three killed and many
wounded.
The latest advices from Kimberley, un
der date of October 21, said the Boer at
tack was still pending, and that large
Boer forces in the neighborhood had de
stroyed big sections of the railroad line
north and south of the town. Many fu
gitives from neighboring villages have
been imprisoned by the Boers. Several
ladles, hearing their husbands had been
captured, visited the Boer camp and were
courteously received. Their intercession
for their husbands was successful and

LONDON, Eng., Oct. 24.â The Colonial Office has received a cable
gram stating that President Steyn of the Orange Free State has
issued a proclamation annexing that part of Cape Colony which is north
of the Vaal River. This means Griqualand West and Bechuanaland,
and is apparently in consequence of the Free State forces having
seised the railway and all stations north of Kimberley except Mafe
king, unless Mafeking has fallen since the last news from there, which
is a week old.
the reunited families have arrived at
Kimberley. The prisoners report that
they were well treated. According 1 to
runners who have arrived at Kimberley
from Kuruman, British Bechuanaland,
the resident magistrate there has recently
presided at a council of the native chiefs.
He advised them not to participate in the
war. The natives expressed satisfaction
at the magistrate's explanations and
promised to remain quiescent.
A dispatch from Pretoria, dated Octo
ber 20. indicates that the Rhodesians, un
der Colonel Hoover, at Fort Tuli, on the
Transvaal border, are taking the offen

at Rhodes Drift, but apparently not much
damage was done on either side. The
Boers say that they lost three horses.

BASUTOS RECEIVE
OVERTURES FROM BOERS
LONDON, Oct. 24.â The Colonial Office
this evening published a dispatch re
ceived from the British High Commis
sioner In South Africa, Sir Alfred Milner,
communicating a significant dispatch
from Sir Godfrey Laigden, the British
resident Commissioner In Basutoland, call-
Ing attention to the recklessness of the
Basutos, whom, he says, he has been try
ing to calm. The resident Commissioner
adds:
"Our policy, however, has been marie
difficult by the blustering of the Boers,
who have freely threatened to attack
Masuru and other stations. These threats,
combined with intriguing, have con
tributed to rouse excitement among the
natives. I wish to place it on record that
the Bqeri have unwisely attempted t i
shake the allegiance of the Basutos and
frustrate our efforts toward tranrjuility.
; The BoerS", therefore, are responsible for
any commotion and for the alarm regard
ing native Invasions which now prevail."
â¢ 'API-; TOWN, Oct 24. The following
advices have been received hore from
Masuru, Basutoland, dated October 2:-i:
"A reliable native lately visited a laager
of Orange Free State troops Just opposite
Masuru. He found it to consist of wagons,
surrounded by turf piled three feet high,
ii' :;nticed only a few Mausers. The
Boer commandant questioned him regard
ing the feeling of the different Basuto
chiefs, principally the paramount chief,
Lorothodl, and in order to draw the com
â¢ mandant, the native replied that the na
; tives sided with the Boers.
"Thereupon the commandant said the
two republics wished to kill the Britishers
and t-v take over and govern the Basutos,
restoring) to the latter that part of the
country which the Free State formerly
took from them. As to the Britishers,
those whom they failed to kill they would
drive into the s'-a.
"The commandant wished a decision on
the part of Lorothodl and the other
chiefs as soon as possibleâ whether they
would titcht the Boers or Britishâ because
his contingent was anxious to help the
Boers else where. He acknowledged that
â¢ n w^re afraid of the Basutos, bc
< a :.-â¢ their v-iv.-s and families, as well as
their cattle, were within reach of a Basuto
incursion; and he said he was prepared
to enter into an agreement with the
chief*, signing the same, to give a very
substantial recompense to the tribesmen
for assisting the Boers. Failing this, if
the BasutOS would give a written under
standing not to assist either side the cÂ»m
mandunt said his forces would withdraw
from the Basutoland border and go to the
assistance of their countrymen, where
fighting was hottest. The Boera on the
Basutoland frontier, according to the best
information obtainable at Masuru, num
ber about 2500."

tury ii]'"ti which we are just entering in
ternational arbitration will be the only
recognisi i met hud for the settlement of
international complications.
"We deeply deplore the attitude taken
by our nation with respect to the Philip
pine Islands, and sinci governments can
deriv< th Ir just powers only from the
consent ol the governed, we protest both
against the policy which would compel a
foreign people to submit to the rule of
tli' United .States and against the war
through which the administration is striv
ing to enforce iis policy.
"We protest against the manifestly
forced and unjust interpretation of the
anti-canteen law. as rendered by Attor

means tor the passage of the
Grout bill which will come before our
next Congr< >s."

ing of C<?BgreeÃmau Roberts was adopted
with Cheers. It i-ml as follows:
"We believe thai i-y allowing BrJghajn
IJ. Roberts of Utah to retain a seat 1n

blow will be struck at every home in our
land. We therefore call upon our repre

be so Impeached, and we pledge ourselves
to bring all possible force to bear to pre
\i nt so great a national disgrace as would
be Involved in allowing the congressman

ing immoral shows, offensive advertise

County are greater sufferers than those of
Calaveras, many bands owned here hav
ing been brought down last month, but
these aggregate less than five hundred
head.
It cleared up yesterday, however, and
the worst if past, for the present. The
rainfall here for the present storm was
nearly five Inches and the snowfall In the
upper ranges was from six to eight feet.
Wliile it has brought death to the cattle,
and even deer, it will prove a blessing
to a wide scope ,of country next summer.
The cold weather which was a feature of
the great storm solidified the snow, caus
ing it to pack hard, and thus insure a
general supply of water next year.
Though the sun is shining brightly to-day
the air is cold and crisp and the snow will
not melt.

The Cabinet decided to allow vessels

the laws of the United States foreign ves

embarrassment resulted. .Many of these
vessels have now passed into American
hands, and the Secretary of War will

to fly the American flag and enjoy all the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, T^EDNESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1899.
TRAIN BLOWN BY GALE
FROM A HIGH BRIDGE
Heavy Loss of Life Attends Disasters Caused
bu a Terrific Tijptioon In
Japan,
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. 24.â News was
brought by the steamer Rio Jun
Mam, which arrived this evening
from the Orient, of the ravages of
a terrific typhoon, said to have
been the worst ever experienced at
Tokio and Yokohama, which visited those
cities and the Japanese coast on Satur
day, October 7 and the day following.
One of the disastrous consequences was a
shocking railway accident, which oc
curred on the River Hokigawa, on the
Japan Railway Company's line.
Just as the storm was developing its
greatest force a train happened to be
crossing the iron bridge over the Hoki
gawa. This bridge, which is situated be
tween the stations of Yalta and Nozaki,
has a length of 1044 feet. The river,
though of small dimensions under ordi
nary circumstances, had been consider
ably swollen by the rains. The train,
from its exposed position on the bridge,
could not resist the pressure of the wind.
The locomotive, owing to its greater
weight, crossed safely, but all the car
riages were tumbled into the bed of the
stream, their coupling with the locomo
tive being severed. The loss of life is
estimated at between thirty and forty
and twenty-three persons were severely
wounded. Fourteen bodies have been
taken out of the wreckage of the train in
the river.
On the Toklado line there was a tidal
wave flooding the whole district and in
the Tago-No-Tra region a wall of water
twenty-five feet high swept up over the
land, "carrying death and destruction. It
NO STRIKE ON
VALLEY ROAD
Slight Grievances That
Will Be Settled.
Special TMspatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Oct. 24.â For some days
past rumors have been In circulation that
a strike on the Valley Railroad was im
minent. A large number of employes
were interviewed to-day and without ex
ception they declared that no such prop
osition was under consideration. The
men could not account for the rumors.
However, there la some dissatisfaction
among the men. especially in the me
cbanical department, over the fact that
the Santa Fe has failed to extend its
wage schedule to this recently acquired
division. â .
"There is no ground for a strike in
which we could secure the aid of other
trainmen," said an engineer to-day. "So
long as a road is in course of construc
tion the genÂ« rul schedule cannot be de
manded. We have been working under
what is known as the construction
schedule. When the Point Richmond
branch is opened ami put in operation 1
doubt not that the general schedule of
- inta Fe. will be extended here. 1 am
speaking now of the trainmen or actual
operatives of the rolling stock. Even if
we had a grievance there would be no
strike The days of strikes on railroads
arc over. If we treat the company fairly
we will come out all right."
The force In the machine shops has
cut down one-half and It is
understood that the muchinery is to be
removed to Albuquerque and only enough
left hefe to do emergency repairs. As
many of the men had been working for
two "years in the hope of advancement,
the decision of the company came to them
;,s Lad luck and left them in no very good
humor. As a matter of fact there are
only about twenty regular engineers, con
ductors and liremen at present in the em
ploy of the company, and should they
Wave their places could be promptly
filled. Many of the employes have every
reason to be loyal to the company and not
<4iiibble over any decision the company
may make. Several of them had be<n
out of employ since the big strike and
\v.>re takm on regardless of how they
might have been marked on the old com
pany's lists. I'ndoubtedly there is dis
satisfaction among some of the men. but
the idea of a strike Is laughed at. There
have been some agitators and one or two
men quit last payday in a huff, but even
though the situation might become
strained the men say they would send a
committee to headquarters and do not
doubt that any differences would be ad
lusted satisfactorily to all concerned.

Mayeda-Shinden, Tago, Nakamaru and
Sameshtma.
In the Moto-Toshiwara regions the dis
tricts devastated were Tanaka-Shinden,
Suzukawa and Kashiwa-Mura, and in the
Jmaido region Mayeda-Shinden (there
appear to be two districts of this name)
and Shinhama. Fifty-three persons were
killed, thirty-six severely Injured and 150
slightly injured.
The wave piled up such a quantity of
sand at the mouth of the Xuma River
that the river was dammed and over
flowed its banks, producing an inundation
of large dimensions. Numbers of houses
were swept away and all that is to be
seen of those remaining is the roofs.
In Tokio and vicinity the damage was
extensive and a number of lives were lost.
Along the coast hundreds of houses were
destroyed and many craft lost. At Oiso
and Koiso the storm was felt with ex
treme violence, the sea sweeping over the
land. At Oiso the steamer t'mezawara
Maru foundered, and all on board, four
teen, were lost.
Here, too, the villas of Viscount Oki
Moukata, Dr. Mitchell and a number of
foreign-owned residences were leveled to
the, ground. The steamers Shinagawa
Maru and Fushlki Maru, both from Kobe
to Yokohama, were damaged and the cap

feeling that stirred us when we received the
news of the battle of San Juan stirred us
three or four days ago, when we received
news of the fighting in the Transvaal.
In reply Sir Thomas said he was deeply
moved by the sincere greeting extended
him. Said he:

Now, gentlemen, I am prepared to make an
other challenge when Mr. Fife regains his

him.
ALLEGES FRAUD AND
SUES FOR PROPERTY
Cristanto Castro Charged With Hav
ing Deceived His Sister to
Gain Her Land.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 24.â A suit Involving
about $50,000 worth of property at Moun
tain View, this county, was filed in the
Superior Court here to-day by Mrs. An
gela Castro, an aged Spanish woman.
The defendants are Crlstanto Castro, the
plaintiff's brother, and A. V. Fatjo, who
holds, in escrow, deeds to the property
mado by Mrs. ("astro to her brother. The
property in question consists of 185 acres
of farming land near Mountain View,
valued at over $30,000 and nearly 100 lots
in town, worth about $12,000.
Mrs. < 'astro alleges in hor complaint
that mi November 16, lSiÂ»6, Cristanto Cas
tro Induced her to deed the property to
him as she was feeble and physically
weak, being SI years of age. She states
the deeds were merely made in trust
so that he could handle her business,

placed the deeds on record, taken pos
session of the lands, usurped the rents
and profits and threatens to soil the lands.
She seeks to have the deeds canceled
and s<-t aside.
Similar action has been begun by Maria
Jos. -fa Castro de Davidson. Vicente Soto,
Angela Castro and Mariano Soto against

SCENES OF DISORDER,
Acrimonious Debate in the Austrian
Reichsrath.
VIENNA. Oct. 24.â A scandalous scene
was witnessed in the Austrian Reichs
rath to-day, growing out of the acrimoni
ous discussion of the language question.
The Minister of Justice. Hr-rr Kindinger,
was literally bombarded with papers by
his opponents, amid shouts of "Resign!"
The uproar finally became indescribable
and the president of the chamber closed
the sitting.
Changes for Naval Officers.

Less Damage Than Expected.
WOODLAND. Oct. 24.â The clear, cold
weather and prevailing north wind are
minimizing the damage to the raisin crop
and the wheat in sacks piled along the
river and railroad tracks for shipment.
Unless there should be another storm
soon the damage will not be so heavy as
at nrst estimated.
phoon, It sustained considerable damage.
While the storm lasted the force of the
wind was terrific and the scene in the
harbor, especially outside the defense
works, was remarkable. Great seas rolled
over the breakwater. The French mail
steamer Tonkin collided with the Ham
burg-American steamer Serbia, both be
ing- damaged, and havoc was played with
the yachts anchored in the harbor. The
town was flooded, the water being in
many places kneedecp.
The storm had Its origin where many
storms have been bornâ in the Riukla
Islands. The depression declared itself
first on the 4th inst., but showed a dispo
sition to pass into the Pacific, and hopes
were entertained that Japan might thu.s
escape without any serious visitation. On
the 6th, however, the center began to
move in a northeasterly direction and it
was then evident that these islands would
be invaded. That night the center reached
Oshima, and on the seventh the storm
swept into the southeast corner of Kiu
shu. Thenceforth it coasted along the
east of Kiushu and Shikoku, the center
probably following a maritime course
and only the skirt of the storm being felt
on shore. But the curve of the main
island brought it nearer the path of the
depression's center, and when the ty
phoon, after crossing from Shikoku,
struck the shore again in the neighbor
hood of Hamada, the winds were exceed
ingly violent. All along the eastern coast
the effects must have been felt very se
verely.

BpÂ»cial Dispatch to The Call.
SAL.EM, Or., Oct. 24.-Joseph A. Wil

ADVERTISEMENTS.
HEART DISEASE.
Some Facts Regarding the Rapid In-
crease of Heart Trouble.
Heart trouble, at least among the Amer-
icans, is certainly increasing, and while
this may be largely due to the excite-
ment and worry of American business
life. It is more often the result of weak
stomachs, of poor digestion.
Real organic disease is incurable; but
not one case in a hundred of heart trou-
ble Is organic.
The close relation between heart trouble
and poor digestion is because both organs
are controlled by the same great nerves â
the. Sympathetic and Pneumogastric.
In another way^ also the heart is af-
fected by the form of pf>or digestion,
which causes gas and fermentation from
half digested food. There is a feeling of
oppression and heaviness in the chest
caused by pressure of the distended sto-
mach on the heart and lungs, interfering
with their action; hence arises palpitation
and short breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
making it thin and watery, which irri-
tates and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for heart
trouble Is to Improve the digestion and
to Insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be done by the regular use
after meals of some safe, pfeasant and
effective digestive preparation, like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which may
be found at most drug stores, and which
contain valuable, harmless digestive ele-
ments in a pleasant, com'enient form.
It is safe to say that the regular per-
sistent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
at mealtime will cure any form of sto-
mach trouble except cancer of the sto-
mach.
Full sized package of these tablets sold
by druggists at 50 cents. Little book on
stomach troubles mailed free. Address F.

PURCHASED DEATH
WITH THEIR FARES
Two Passengers on the Schooner
Hera From Cape Nome Perish
of Starvation.
SEATTLE, Oct. 24.â After a voyage of I
twenty-eight days from Cape Nome, dur
ing which time two men died of starva
tion and others were half crazed by want j
of food and water, the schooner Hera ar
rived in port this morning with nearly 200 '
passengers on board. News of the :
wretched plight of the Hera's passengers |
was brought in on Sunday night by the !
steamer Lakme. The revenue cutter
Grant and the tug Sea Lion Immediately j
started after the schooner. They suc
ceeded in finding her yesterday |
about fifty miles off Cape Flattery.
The two deaths reported were those of
J. S. Ryan, who came on board a well
man, but through bad food and lack of '
attention gradually grew worse until he :
died on October I<s. The other case is i
much the same. George Lamhy, through ;
want of nourishment and confinement in j
ill-ventilated quarters, was attacked by j
typhoid fever and died on October 21. j
While he was sick he had absolutely no j
medical attention. Both men were buried j

HORSE THIEF SHOT
BY PURSUING OFFICER
As the Criminal Falls He Attempts
to Swallow Poison From a
Bottle He Carried.
SPOKANE, Wash., Oct. 24.â Marshall
Dethridge of Oakesdale to-day shot in
the back and probably fatally wounded
a horsethief he was pursuing. As the
robber fell he grabbed a bottle 1 of poison
from an inner pocket and swallowed a
portion of the contents before he could
be restrained. The officer hurried the
man to the nearest physician. Emetics
were given and other means taken to pre
vent fatal effects from the poison. The
bullet wound, however, is expected to
prove fatal, although the robber is still
alive.
The Marshal was acting under tele
phoned instructions from Colfax that a
thief had stolen a team and buggy there.
The man was discovered at the outskirts
of town. He refused to surrender and
attempted to escape when the Marshal
nred. The bullet penetrated the back
near the t spine and low down. The wound
ed man refuses to give his name. He de
stroyed all identity, even eating the
leaves of a book in his pocket that might
identify him. In the buggy there was
found a couple of saddles and bridles, and
two sets of harness evidently stolen. The
Sheriff is expected here this evening and
if able to be moved he will take the pris
oner to Colfax.

was plenty of flour, but the water â was
short. Four days ago the last of the un
palatable salt horse was consumed. Had.
it not been for rainstorms, which fell for
a few days, they would have been with
out water also.
When the Hera anchored out In the
stream the majority of the men were so
weak that they could not carry tneir gold
dust ashore without assistance. Several
passengers were crazed from their terrible
experiences, and had to be carried ashore
and taken care of. Even taking their
terrible voyage into consideration, the
passengers unite in declaring Nome to be
the greatest camp on earth, and many of
them will return in the spring.
BREASTWORK ABOUT
THE TOWN OF NACO
] Mexican Authorities Preparing to
Resist Threatened Attack by the
Cowboys.
BISBEE, Ariz., Oct. 24.â Intense excite
ment has reigned among both American
and Mexican residents at Naco all day to-
I day. The Mexican garrison was rein
! forced late last night by detachments of
infantry and cavalry from La Marita and
i Magdalena. As soon as the additional
; forces arrived the Mexicans began pre
paring for an attack. They threw up
! breastworks around the town, extending
i to within 300 feet of the boundary line.
' Several field pieces were also rolled into
; position and the works were manned by
; a cordon of soldiers with an advance line
j of mounted pickets thrown out to patrol
i the border and keep a lookout for the in
vaders.
Babe Thompson, the recognized leader
;of the cowboys, has counseled them
, against making an assault on the Mcxl-
I can works until every means has been
: exhausted to secure the release of the
two prisoners without resort to violence.
Judge Mendoza held court last night
I and sent word across the border that he
i had decided to release Joseph Rhodes on
| a bond of $S(XiO. The bond was promptly
1 made and Rhodes was surrendered to his
j friends. George Maarts is still being held
, and the indications now are that he will
i also be released within a few hours.

RAINIER DID
NOT RECEIVE
A TASTY RIDE
Buchanan Suspended for His
Effort on the Rat-Tailed
Horse.
Thwe were not many actual surprises
at Oakland yesterday, even If two rather
pronounced choices were counted out.
Lothian and Rainier proved the disap
pointments, but this downfall was
prophesied by several of the close hanal
cappera. The track is gradually becoming
dried out. and the sport afforded nothing
bordering on the sensational.
About as rusty a rfo> as any furnished
during the afternoon was the ono put up
by Buchanan aboard Kami or In the mlle
and-a-slxteenth Belling run, captured by
FestOÃO. The latter, the entry of J.
Naglee Burke, was quite the good thing
in tho bolting, being played from 10 to i,
and the Wfidldle gluing led from start
to finish. Oraibee in a drive led Qlen
Anne out for the place. Rainier, the
favorite, seemed overflowing with speed,
but contrary to orders Buchanan made
no effort to take the lead from Festoso,
and after rating along in second place
allowed himself to be cut oft*. He eventu
ally finished fourth, and earned suspen
sion for his effort.
The big rogue Bamboulia took tho open-
Ing scramble for two-year-olds in a gallop
from The Echo. He closed favorite in the
ring, ami led tho Artillery fllly out wlth
considerable to spare. Jolly Briton ran
a fair third, coming from back in the
bunch.
In the seven furlong selling: run Kio
Chlco ran like the hursen the Watson
boys used to bet on, making an end to
iftair of :t. Slnk f s entry receded from
Ift and galloped home. Lothian, tho
â !, choice, with Johnny Ranch in
the saddle, dlv his best, beating I^'u Rey
out a head for the place. The last-named
colt la one that will improve and bears
watching.
Th< six and a half furlong number de
veloped the fact that fairly good two
year-olds ran beat a mediocre assortment
of selling platers about this period of the
year. My Gypsy picked up 75 pounds and
Johnny Ranch and ran away with the
purse. In the Btretch, Anchored tired
and Ailenna. the other two-year
â¢ Id entry, led him out for second place.
ftering also ran.

In front. Tl | rinter had his
rubbed from 9 to â¢' to even money
fay iritism, and was n< ver headed. Dona
tor, well handled by Johnny Woods,

f L.'st Girl for the place. Reolla and
Polish ran as if in need of a rest.
TRACK NOTES.
Buchanan was suspended for his effort
astride Rainier. According to the state
ment of Dr. O'Rourke, the horse's owner,
Buchanan did not ride to instructions or
make any effort to <]<> so. On the con
trary, it looked as if the boy went out of
the way to get his mount beaten.
The Western Turf Association's first
list of kes, which will be run during
November and December, will close to
day. The management of the new racing
venture announce that the track will open
on November 4.
Jim Morgan, the crack Montana jockey,
arrived yesterday and will '..â¢â¢ seen in the
saddle to-day. Morgan was the sensa
tion of the East last spring, until he got
.-: hard fall while riding Squire Abingdon,
suffering a compound fracture of the
shoulder. On more than one occasion he
nearly caused Spencer to fall, off his
mount, beating that well-known rider in
several desperate finishes. Morgan has
Cherokee blood in his veins, and it Is un
necessary to a?k if he is trying.

Golden Gate Park Driving
Association Abandons Its
Ingleside Meetng.
The members of Golden Gate P.irk
I>rivins Association met last nighi and
after extended discussion determined to
abandon their autumn race meeting for
which they had planned ambitiously. All
arrangements had been perfected to hold
ii last Saturday, but th>- heavy m.ins left
the track deep with mud. over which
hors<-s could not draw the racinu' sulkies.
Tho conditions were such it waa thought
best to declare the meeting off altogether.
The track would requin a lot <>f attention
to place it in proper condition, while some
of the owners wished to withdraw their
horses from competition. To please those
who still wished to race, It was decided
to shift the scene of operations from
Ingleslde to the I'ark speedway.
A programme of four races will be run
off there on Saturday, November 4 for
trophi>s valued at $20, t<> which wiil be
added the entranci teva of $â¢"> per b 1
Each race will be best two in thrfc beats
over a distance of three-fourths of a mile.
The length of the Bpeedway does not per
mit "f satisfactory races at one mile.
Entries will close on the 31st |nst., and
all tin- horses now in training are expect
ed to compete.
Tho race for the Frank G. O'Kane cup
will not b>- Included in the programme, as
the conditions require that it be raced
for on a circular track. Efforts will prob
ably be made to retain the double team
race, as that Is one of tho most exciting
of contests. Amateur drivers ulftrm that
more double teams have been in evidence
In the Park during the past fortnight than
in many years previously.
George W. Kingsbury was elected a
member of the association at last night's
meeting.
C. F. Kapp drove a team composed of
his black horse I. Direct and Dunlap's
King Cadenza, a mile in 2 :30, over Ingle
slde track yesterday. The going was par
ticularly heavy, which makes the per
formance a creditable one. The horses
were rated along evenly every eighth
mile, being at about the same relative
speed.

which has hung over the champion's
quarters since the accident to his arm

Jeffries took a long ride at an early
hour with Tommy Ryan, and after a fast
run over the Long Branch road played
croquet with his trainers on the lawn.
This afternoon the champion's hig^h spir

jokes. Meanwhile, Jeffries and Ryan pre
pared for t!.<' second afternoon bout,
which proved to be a wonderful exhibi

tactics brought him a blow in the jaw
that caused th,. claret to flow. Tin- boiler

never be able to land it.
The physician's services were dispensed

Tom Bharkey was feeling particularly

"Jeffries Is nil right." said he, "but he
is not meeting any such Tom Sharkey as
he had that little ring seanco with In

Showing Against Gus
Ruhlin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Oct. 24.â Jim Jeffords, the
young California pugilist, made his debut at
the new Broadway Athletic Club to-night
and was knocked out in the fifth round by
Gus Ruhlin, the Akron (Ohio) giant.
There was a lot of slugging in the first
four rounds, and if Jeffords had not mixed
things so freely he might have stalled off
Ruhltn's rushes. The latter simply bat
tered him down after Jeffords had gained
a very decided advantage. Ruhlin '.
him three times in the fourth round ami
put him out with a straight Jeft early in
the next round. Ruhlin was a big favor
ite in the betting, 2 to 1 being laid -a him.
In the preliminary bout Kid Thomas of
New York won from Jim H^yward (col
ored) of Chicago in the fourth round.
Thin was Hayward's lirst defeat since
coming East. lie was knocked down
three times in the fourth round.
Gus Rulilin was the tirst of the big
fellows to enter the ring. He looked tit.
He was accompanied by his manager and
trainer, Billy Madden, and "Cockey "
Boyle, Charley Goff and Joe Hurst, who
acter as his seconds.
Ten minutes later Jeffords appeared.
He had as his seconds "Mysterious" Billy
Smith, Billy Needham, Charley O'Brien
and Harry Luthill. Jeffords said he
weighed 192 pounds and Ruhlin owned up
to 190. They were announced I
twenty rounds, under Marquis of Queens
bery rules.
First roundâ rushed and Jeffords sent his I
'.eft to the body. They clinched. Jeffords sent i
his rlÃh to Ru'hlins car and then to the body.
Ruhlin clinched and In the breakaway sent his.
right to the body. , â
Second roundâ Jeffords rushed, trying left |
and right swings for the head, which were
blocked. Jim Jabbed left to body and face
and then shot his right to the jaw. Gus Jabbed
left to the face. Both began slugging, with j
Jeffords having the call up to the bell.
Third roundâ Jeffords rushed and Gus ewung
wildly. They exchanged leftg on the face and
then Qua whipped right and left to the head
and smashed a hard right on Jeffords" nose,
which began to bleed. Jeffords staggered from
this blow and Ruhlin slugged him. The Call
fornlan looked to be beaten, but he suddenly
braced up and sent a couple of right upper
cuts under Ruhlln's chin, which changed the !
tide in his favor. Ruhlin was very much used j
up at the close of the round.
Fourth roundâ They got to close Quarters
three times In succession. Jeffords was the ag
gressor. Hard exchanges followed, among
them being a right uppercut from Jeffords,
which sent Gus back a few feet. Ruhlin pulled
himself together quickly and sent three straight
lefts to the face and sent Jeffords to the floor
with a short right-arm Jolt on the Jaw. Jef
forda took eight seconds to get up, only to be
sent down again with a straight left. Jef- j
fords managed to get to his feet and hugged :
Ruhlin when he got up, but Gup shoved him
off and beat him down with left-hand chops.
Jeffords was floored for the third time and was
practically out when the gong sounded.
Fifth round â Ruhlin now had it all his own
way and went right nt his man. He led a left I
to the face, which staggered Jeffords to the;
ropes. Then he sent both hands swinging to
the head, and as Jeffords staggered, this
stepped hack and, putting all the force of his i
big frame into the blow, he landed a straight ,
left hand squarely on the mark and Jeffords
fell as if dead. He lay prone on the floor
until the referee counted him out Time of
round, one minute and fourteen seconds.

FUNSTON WILL
NOT ENTER INTO
A CONTROVERSY
Says Archbishop Is
Misinformed.
The answer of Archbishop Ohapellc to
ments concerning the Catholic
church in the Philippines, said to have
been made last week by Brigadier Gen
eral Funston in his address to the stu
dents at Stanford University, will prob
ably cl..se the incident. General Funston,
who had r.tired early last night. BOme
what the worse for the weather, sent
word to a <'all representative, who had
called at his home in Oakland, that he
diil not care to enter into any controversy
in the matter, and that Archbishop Oha
p. lie had undoubtedly been misinformed
concerning what he had said.
Th>- Archbishop, as will be seen by a
reference to his statement published in
yesterday's Call, takes the view that Gen
eral Funston. whom he characterizes as
a broad-minded and fair man, had not
been correctly quoted. In support of
this proposition the testimony of Pn-si-
Davld Starr Jordan is important.
Referring to Archbishop Chapelle s criti
cism of language said to have been used
by General Funston, he said last night:
"General Funston can speak for himself
as to his opinions and the basis on which
they rest. it is, however, only fair to
him to say that the language quoted is
so twisted, through condensation, that :1c
original force is lost. He said nothing to
the discredit of the Catholic church and
nothing as to 'confiscation of church
property,' save as to the possible secu
larization of lands held In trust by the
oni>T of Spanish friars. He said that
though the natives of T^uzon bitterly
hated the friars, they are nevertheless
devoted to the Catholic church."

CARTER FAILED
TO REMEMBER
HIS PROMISES
Estate Sued by Mary
E. Redmond.
By the filing nf an answer yesterday
issues have been joined in the suit insti
tuted by Mary E. Redmond against the
estate of the late Thomas Carter, in
which the plaintiff seeks to recover $10,000
damages for alleged breach of promise on
the part of the deceased capitalist. 'me
case will now go to trial, and the world
will hear the story of the amours of the
dead car-builder of N< waik.
In the complaint in this action the
plaintiff alleges that in June of 1596 she
instituted suit against Carter to recover
$50,000 damages for breach of promise.
Carter negotiated with her for a settle
ment and finally she agreed to accept $2000
and a promise that he would leave her
$10,000 by his will. Carter died, the plain
tiff was not mentioned as a devisee, and
hence she seeks to recover the sum named
from his estate.
In the answer filed yesterday Martin
Carter, executor of his brother's will,
after entering a general denial to the
various allegations of Miss Redmond, sets
forth in defense an alleged waiver of all
claims against the dead signed and issued
by the plaintiff. This document rf^ads:
Know all men by these presents: That I,
Mary E. Kedmond, for and in consideration of
the sum of $5400 and other valuable considera
tion to me in hand, paid this day by Thomas
Carter, the receipt whereof is hereby admitted
and acknowledged, have remised, released and
forever quitclaimed unto Thomas Carter from
all mimnÂ»r< ot actlona and demand? whatso
ever, lncl'iding any and all agreements and
promisen of marriage (which said agreements
and promises of marriage and to marry said
Thomas Carter hnth now and forever denied),
and any and all claims of, and for, support
aril maintenance, by prisons of uny Inter
course or association I may ever have had with
him or any other claims, and I further prom
ise and agree not to begin any suit against
Thomas Carter in any court for any matter
whatsoever, nor to consult nor engage any at
torney in that behalf.
It is said that as the date of the~in
strument precedes the date of tho filing
of the suit during Carter's life to recover
$50,000, it being dated July 10, 18M, It
will not stand as a valid defense in plain
tiff's action.
Sent Bad Meat to Town.
N. F. Witzeman, Chief Meat Inspector,
swore to a complaint in Judge Treadwell's
court yesterday for the arrest of "John
Doe" Vecchl of Vecehi Brothers, San
Rafael, on the charge of violating the
health ordinance by sending diseased
meat into the city. Policeman Butter
worth, who is attached to the Board
of Health, went to San Rafael yesterday
afternoon to make tho arrest. Simi
Brothers of this city were arrested for
having i.he meat in their possession, but
they proved to Judge Treadwell yester
day that they were innocent of its con
dition, and it was decided to arrest the
consignor.
For Suffering Cubans.
An enjoyable entertainment was given,
by the International Brotherhood League
at Academy of Science Hall last evening.

the league, and at the close of the evening
a generous contribution was made by the
audience, to be used in purchasing sup
plies for the Cubans.

KOWALSKY MISTAKEN
FOR FRENNA, THE SLAYER
Colonel Henry I. Kowalsky came within
an ace of getting "pinched" late Sunday
evening, but in justice to the colonel it
might be said that he was thoroughly in
nocent of the position he occupied.
Sunday evening the colonel dropped his
portly form into a box in the Orpheum.
There was seated in the dress circle of the
theater a young man who from his ear
liest youth has known Joseph P, Frenna,
the murderer of James F. Turner. Ko
walsky has lost about twenty-five pounds
within the last few months and Frenna
has gained a similar amount of avoirdu
pois. Both now are about the same size,
both sport a black fringe on the upper
lip and both wear clothes. During the
long play the eyes of the young man
seldom wandered to the stage, and when
tho colonel tinally left the theater he was
shadowed by his discoverer. Kowalsky
didn't know it, and advanced along the
pavement. He drew a card from his
pocket and looked around the cabs for a
familiar number. It wasn't there, so he
continued along O'Farrell street, turned
into Powell and continued his course to
Geary. Again Colonel Kowalsky started
forward, reached Post street and hesitat
ed. Now was the time or never. The
young man who had followed him so
faithfully began a search for a policeman,
but before one was found the colonel had
taken a car, which sped away in the rain
just beginning to fall. The young man
who discovered him was chagrined at los
ing him so easily, but, undaunted, carried
the matter to Sheriff Martin yesterday
morning. Sheriff Martin was preparing to
clean out the County Jail, when one of
his sleuths found that Frenna was dozing
in his cell during theater hours on Sunday
night. Colonel Kowalsky, he also dis
covered, was the cause of all the trouble.
Revenue Decisions.
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch was
notified yesterday of a decision of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue that,
owing to the absence of a special statu
tory provision exempting' them, county
fairs must pay the special tax.
The United States Board of General Ap
praisers, sitting at New York City, has

1 1 Karnes will give a history of the or
der which in the past thirty odd years
has distributed nearly eighty-nine million
dollars to widows and orphans of deceased
members of the order and a large sum to
living members in sick benefits. He will
tell now more than thirty years ago
"Father" Upchuroh. in Meadville. Pa.,
wishing to help his fellow workmen, con
ceived the Idea of having them band to
gether, and by paying a small amount
monthly create a fund to be used in as
sisting widows and orphans.
From this small organization the ; ork
men have increased to more than 360,000,
and a number of other organizations
working on the same lines have sprung
into existence. Ex-Grand Recorder David
S Hirshberg will talk on the fraternal
feature of the Order of Workmen.
ASK
QUESTIONS!
Before you invest in oil stocks,
ask questionsâ lots of them. Ask
about the title to the land, the
area, facilities for transportation
and the cost to get the product to
market. Ask, too, about the
amount of development work ac-
complished and what disinterested
bodies (if any) reported the pres-
ence of oil on the property.
Our answers and the proof to
these and other questions will war-
rant your investing in our stock
at $5 per share. Our wells In Con-
tra Costa, nine miles from Oak-
land, where we have bored 900 feet,
will be producing oil in less than
ten days. Then you won't be able
to buy stock at any price. Come
and ask questions.

IN his address in the Twenty-eighth Assembly Dis
tnct Mr. I ::eian proceeded to assume that labor
ing men would r.ot be allowed to vote. He there
upon worked himself into a hot box and excitedly
cried out: "I want you all to know that the Civu
Lode guarantees two nours xrom his jabor without i
loss of pay to every man. to vote at a general election, j
We snail insist upon this, but want no one to lose
his position by it, but the code says no one shall I
lose his position for it. I shail have it announced i;i j
the newspapers, after legal advice. I want you to
do this not for our sakes. but for yours, because we
are your friends, working for you."
By the way, Mr. Pheian of course has released
the iarge number of wage-workers employed in his j
industrial enterprises, to whom he pays wages. His ]
rent collectors, who promptly collect from his ten- I
ants, and his bank clerks, who figure interest on his '
gold-bearing mortgages, can march to the polls with |
conndence that their places will be open alter they ]
have used the red rubber stamp on the Australian
baliot. But he is afraid that the gentlemen who
merely employ thousands of common mechanics,
who by their wages support tens of thousands in i
their families, will not get a chance to vote .unless j
"I" consult a lawyer and publish it in the news-

disfranchisement, is something to make the statues
en hi lawn slap their gypsum thighs and laugh like
the front row at a ballet.
Ihe Republican candidates want even' mechanic j
and workingmen to vote. Three years ago the la- J
boring men did not need Mr. Phelan's assistance and
the advice of his lawyer on that matter. They had
plenty ot leisure. There was no need of the code
to secure their positions after r.vo hours spent at the
polls, for they had no positions to lose, no waeeÂ«
to sacrifice. They were taking their turn for a day's j
work on the Balboa boulevard and other semi- I
charitable public enterprises, devised to keep them |
away from the public souphouse or the poorhouse. I
Mr. Phelan'3 party had been running things, and
while the great Pheian industry of rent collecting and-Â»
interest computation went on just the same, the great
wage-paving industries were dead.
i hey are now resurrected. Every day the call
goe9 out for men to earn the wages that are ready
for them to win. The allegiance of the working
man is not to men, but to conditions which he in
telligently comprehends. Mr. Phelan in his speech
accepting his nomination of himself said that if ha
is elected Mayor now, and his party wins, having
been faithful over few things it will be trusted over
many in the State and in the nation. This was a
plain declaration that a vote cast for him is a vote
affecting State and national politics. The working
men had a long, hard taste of his kind of national
politics. It gave them ample leisure to study the
effect. They do not wish any more of it just now,
and are interested in the conditions which suggest
another dose. They don't wish to build another
Balboa boulevard.

A NEW PATRIOTISM
WE recently quoted certain Eastern imperialist
newspapers and the Array and Navy Journal
on the patriotic duty i ans to support
England in her policy of destroying the two Dutch
republic- I Africa, the Orange Free State
ar.ii the Transvaal. It must be confessed that at the
â¢ â :. - we felt a "" -

Concurrently with the enlargement of this news
comes an interview with Hon. Clifton R. Breckin
ridge, son of John C. Breckinridge, and recently
Minister to Russia, in which he declares that if the
powers present such identical note, or attempt to em
barrass England while she is exterminating the
South African republics, â â¢ will be the imperative
duty of the United States to take the part of Great
Britain and sustain her with our whole moral and
material force. He says that England's action in
South Africa "is in line with the duty and the de
velopment of the Anglo-Saxon race." and she de
serves the unanimous support of the American peo
pie, and "we should be enjoined by every sentiment

Surely the world has never seen such a transforma

THE FIRST DAY'S FIGHT AT GLENCOE.
i \ J HEN" the account of the first day's fighting
\ \j at Glencoe, near Dundee, given in the dis
k * patch from Pretoria published in The Call
yesterday, is compared with that given out by the
British it will be that the conflict between the
antagonists on the field was not much greater than
that between the reports of the results. The compari
son is worth noting. Owing to the isolation of the
Transvaal nearly all the news from the war must
come from British sources or be transmitted by
! British lines of communication, and is therefore
liable to the coloring of British hopes or prejudices.
The evidence given in the Pretoria dispatch of ex
aggeration in the reports of the first battle will serve
to show to what extent allowance will have to be
made for the^e inevitable misrepresentations.
The British reports of the battle were to the effect
that a severe and almost a crushing defeat had been
inflicted upon the Boers. It was said: "There was
eight hours of continuous heavy firing. * * *
The British loss was severe, Lut that of the Boers
was much heavier. * * * The Boers got a re
verse which may possibly, for a time at any rate,
check all aggressive action." After describing the
charge up the hill and the capture of the position
occupied by the artillery of the Boers, the British
rts went on to say: '"As the Boers streamed
wildly down the hills, making for the main road,
they found their retreat had been cut off, but they
| rallied for a while and there was severe firing on
both sides. Many of them surrendered. A rough
estimate places the British loss at 250 killed and
wounded, and that of the Boers at 800."
The report from Pretoria giving an account of the
battle says: "The Transvaal Government received
this morning (October 21) the following dispatch
from Commander General Piet Joubert: 'Com
mander Lucas Meier has had an engagement at
Dundee. He made a plan of campaign with Com
mandant Erasmus by messenger. Erasmus, however,
â¢ 3 appear. It is estimated that the British lost
heavily. Our forces suffered, but owing to the mist
it hss been impossible to get all the details. It is re
â¢ ten of our forces were killed and twenty
rive v
Thus in a r- nfiict which the British report ss a
severe reverse to the Boers, the Boers report but
ten killed and twenty-five wounded, instead of the 800
estimated by the British. As to which of the two
accounts is the nearer accuracy something in the way
of light may be derived from the fact that instead of
7 being prevented from undertaking aggressive action
â  time the Boer? were able to renew the at
tack next day and are at this time pressing the Brit
ish hard and close not only at that point but at all
-ng the line of defense.
It is clear from this evidence that while the Brit
ish reports may be in the mam correct, they are not
to be relied upon so far as the estimates of the re
sults of the battles are concerned. Even- success of
their arms will seem to them a crushing defeat of the
Boers, and later news will be required to tell whether
the Boers themselves fee! it in that way.
The goat has been made the subject of a joke for
times beyond number, but" when the cook of the
City and County Hospital uses the ciown of beasts
for mutton chops it seems like carrying the joke too
far.
THE CHARTER DECISION.
IN rebuking Examiner rant over the s.uit to test
the validity of the new charter we pointed out the
prime necessity of a judicial test of that instru
ment prior to its taking effect as the fundamental
of the city. Every man of common sense under
stood the need of arftrming it before it became opera
tive rat':- subjecting every municipal interest
to the suspense of waiting upon such a decision after
g ivernraent was organized according to its terras.
The decision is rendered. The charter is sustained
in all its parts and there is hereafter no temptation
to attempt to have it judicially picked to pieces by
tt law on any of its provisions or details.
It is now the fundamental law. It became so not
by the action or agency of any political party but
by the calm co-operation of all the separate depi
of authority, popular, leeislative, executive and ju
dicial, by law charged with the power to join in its
production. It is easy of enforcement and will be
enforced to the line and the letter, for the public
opinion which ran throughout its creation will stand
back of its administration.
Walter L. Farnsworth of Chicago has admit- I
to the police of that city that he is not only a man of
many aliases but is a bigamist to the extent of forty
two wives in as many parts of the world. He is a
candy man, too, sweet thing!
TRUSTS AND CURRENCY REFORM
SENATOR ALLISON in opening the Repub
lican campaign in lowa was notably strong in
his declarations concerning the action like to
be taken by the Republicans of Congress this winter
in dealing with questions of currency reform and the
regulation of trusts, those two issues having been
given considerable importance in the campaign by
the Democrats, who have charged the Republican
party with being favorable to trusts and with playing
fast and loose with the financial issue. These mat
ters are of concern to the whole nation and it is
therefore gratifying that the Senator spoke of them
rather than of some local question, for no 'Senator
can speak for Republicanism with more authority
than Allison.
"The Republican party," said he, "has not hesi
tated to deal with the question of trusts in the past
ill not shrink from dealing with it now." He
went on to point out that the issue has been raised
by the natural evolution of our economic life and
that the solution of its problems requires the highest
abilities and the best purposes of earnest student;.
At present it is not and cannot be made a party ques
tion, since all parties are agreed that trusts should
be subject to regulation for the purpose of prevent
ing such evils as may develop in them, but no party
a> yet has formulated any definite plan or policy of
regulation. Congress, said he, and the various State
legislatures will after full debate legislate in such a
way as to minimize if not wholly eradicate the per
nicious features of such combinations, and to that
end the best men of both parties should and doubt
â  ;s will work together.
The currency question is a party question and
Senator Allison confirmed the expectations of those
who look to the Republican majority in Congress
â¢.=;ure currency reform at the coming session.
Upon that point he said:
"It is the purpose of the Republican party, which
has constantly sustained our system of sound money
based upon the gold standard, to continue to main
tain it â all of it. whether silver or paper â at a parity
with and convertible directly or indirectly into gold
at the will of the holder, and it will be maintained in
the future, not by the voice of party, but by the voice
of the American people, and the laws upon our
statute books upon this subject will be invigorated
rind strengthened to maintain it and preserve it, and to
make it impossible for any Secretary of the Treasury
or any President by his own fiat and without positive
affirmative legislation of Congress to force upon the
people in some hour of temporary depression or of
national slumber the depreciated standard of silver
money, or place any of our money at a premium or
discount."
It is to be noted that Congressman Henderson,
who will be the Speaker of the House, in a recent
speech has taken exactly the ground of Senator Alli
son on both these iÂ«sues. "There should be abso
lutely no party politics," he said, "on the trust ques
tion. The party or person who attempts to make
political capital out cf it is neither wise nor fair. The
party that does it is controlled by demagogues and
the person who does it is a demagogae." Concern
ing the financial .question, he said: "I predict that a
Republican Congress will legislate at the coming
session so as to increase the confidence of the peo
ple, establish firmly the gold standard of the civil
ized world and let the people know that all their
obligations will be discharged on a safe, firm basis."
Admiral Dewey is sharing the penalties as well
as receiving the rewards of greatness. Hetty Green
now claims him as a relative. She says her grand
mother was a Storey and one of "his female ancestors
was a Storey and â but that's another story.

HOW LIPTON
GOT HIS START
IN THE WORLD
MUCH Is being published about Sir
Thomas Lipton ai this timeâ about
his origin, his birth, his rise, his
tastes, affiliations, passions and
prejudices. I have met him sev
eral times, and think I know him fairly j
well. I have not met him since he became j
Sir Thomas; he was plain Mr. Lipton '
APPRECIATED THE CALL'S MAP OF THE WAR
whe-n I last encountered him. and traveled
; in the same Pullman coach with him from
El Pa.=o, Texas, to the city of Washington.
I should think this was about five years
; ago.
It has been asserted time and again, ana
I frequently on the alleged authority of Sir
Thomas, that he was born in Glasgow,
'â â  Scotland, though of Irish parentage. Sir
Thomas told me that he was born in the
town of Dungannon, county of Tyrone.
; Ireland, and that his people lived in Ire
[ land. He was taken to Scotland by his
' parents in his infancy and they settled in
I Glasgow. He was given five years at the
! public schools, and then was apprenticed
!in a big mercantile establishment. His
1 duties here for the first few years were
j various. He was kicked and cuffed, of
course. He attended to the windows, he
â¢ up the floors, and polished up the
I handles of the big front doors.
At the end of his first year's service he '
j found himself with half a crown anead. !
; A half-crown is a British silver coin, |
sometimes called "two-and-six," and ap- j
proxirr.ates closely to our 50-cent piece, j
He was happy. The coin did not get an j
: opportunity to burn his pocketâ he salted }
'< It away. The second year he had a little
| more money; the third year more still. ;
and finally at the end of five years and his â 
' apprenticeship he was the absolute owner i
j of Â£10, rousjhiy speaking $50. But he had
accumulated a whole lot of worldly ex- ;
perlence, wisdom, and the craft of com
merce.
Let it be understood that I am reciting
this history as he told it to me himself in 1
! th* long journey between El Paso and i
I Washington. When he found himself a !
, free man with Â£10 "to boot" an irresistible <
'â  desire to visit his birthplace at Dungan- ,
! non, Ireland, possessed him. He ascer- i
.' talned that it would take nearly one-fifth !
â of his capital to make the journey. He j
â  knew right well that the cost of his sus- !
tenance while at Dungannon need not be ;
I taken into account. He left for his native i
I place, being then 17 years old. He told
! me at length the delights of his visit. \
\ How simple and industrious and prudent
: and patriotic hi? relatives and their neigh-
I bors were; about his viÃits to the old
; church in Dungannon, where the historic
! convention of the Irish volunteers of 1752
: was held that demanded and wonâ for a
timeâ the legislative Independence of Ire
i land.
But wh.it attracted the commercial side
I of him was the Irish bacon. It goes with
j out saying that a. cookc-d pig is best when
:he is Irish. This If not only a maxim in
i trade but of the palate. Making inquiries
. young Llpton discovered that the rafters
I of every Irish farmhouse for miles around
I were laden with bacon, that there was no
(market for'it, and consequently no com
'< merclal value. Lipton. who had concluded
j to splurge a few shillings of his "pile" to
i make an impression on his old neighbors,
â  changed his mind and invested every pen
! Ny he had in Irish bacon. He carried It
1 back to Glasgow with him in a good
i sized box as luggage. He knew well the
; tastes and character of the principal pa
trons of the establishment where he
; served his apprenticeship, and to these he
displayed and sold his Irish bacon. He
1 cleared Â£10 in this, his first speculation.
He lo?t no time in returning to Ireland
and securing an option on all the bacoa in
the vicinity of Dungannon. Thus he laid
the foundation of his fortune.
Sir Thomas was given the handle to his
name Fcon after the Queen's Diamond
! Jubilee. There are two kinds of sirs in
I Great Britain. One kind is of the baronet
1 class, hereditary and regarded as semi
: aristocratic. The other, called knights,
: nearly anybody can attain who does any-
I thing successful. The usual route to this
I latter honor is to make a contribution to
some charity in which royalty is inter
ested, or to the campaign chest of the
party in power.
On the occasion of the Queen's Jubilee
the Princess of Wales parented the idea
i of giving a big feed including pie and un
i usual incidentals to the poor of Lon
; <3on. She appealed for funds and the re
j sponse was not gratifying nor s^pontane
i ous. The scheme was on the verge of col
lapse when Lipton went forward with a
I contribution of $125,000. Soon afterward
I he was dubbed Sir Thomas.
He has large interests In this country.
i He owns immense cattle raising ranches
j n Texas and Montana and is largely mi
i terested in more than one of the big pack
i ing establishments of Chicago.
| Sir Thomas does not readily trtl his age,
' but I shu uld Judge that he was in the
â  neighborhood of 53 years. He is well pre
â¢ served. His mustache is of good growth,
' and he shaves himself every morning. So
I expert he !s at shaving that he did it on
1 a Baltimore and Ohio train east of Graf
i ton, where it requires a gymnast almost
Ito hold his seat. He is an all-round good
1 fellow, and would remind one of a Central
: Western American rather than of a
â  Briton. There is no txclusiveness about
: him. He is hearty in his manners, likes
i an occasional glass of whisky nr a bottle
j of ale and smokes both cigars and a pipe.
' In British politics he is a thorough
Irish Nationalist. He will probably be a
member of Parliament after the next gen
eral election. About a year ago Veaey
Knox. a Nationalist, resigned the repre
sentation of Derry in Parliament and the
Irish committee offered the seat to Sir
Thomas. He hesitated for a few days
and concluded not to enter Parliament
then, but promised to go in as a thorough
Nationalist at the next general election.

The urgency to get those dining

Of course, as is ever the case, there

the way Brass Beds are going. Can

This extraordinary run on Brass and

SCANDAL'S BLIGHT ON
THE HOTEL RAFAEL
Baron yon Schroeder Destroyed
It as a Reputable Resort
General Warfield Demands and Secures a
Release of His Obligation as Man
ager and Lessee.
General R. H. Warfield will, on Novem- I
ber 1, surrender his lease of the Hotel \
Rafael to Baron yon Schroeder, the own- !
er of the property. To the general public !
this retirement of General Warneld will
be a surprise, but to those who have had '
an opportunity of observing events at the j
San Rafael hostelry, the expected has |
happened. General Warneld found it im
possible to conduct a respectable hotel
and to permit Baron yon Schroeder to |
enter the doors. The general has decided,
therefore, to retire from the contract that
was neither pleasant nor profitable.
He could not ask patronage of reputa- j
ble men and women and at the same I
time wink at the escapades of the Baro-n. I
It was impossible to ask decent men and
women who honor their homes to reside
under the same roof where gambling and
outrageous revelry made noisy the hours
of the night and shocked the senses of
respectable people. The Baron insisted ]
upon having his way and the other guests I
of General Warfleld indulged their privi- I
lege of moving out. Scandal threw its I
shadow over the establishment, and in j
that shadow General Warfleld counted j
his losses. The Baron became altogether !
too expensive a luxury and General War
field determined if possible to dispense
with him.
He therefore asked that he be permitted
to retire from the obligation of his lease
before its legal termination.
Baron yon Schroeder granted the !
request, and it is presumed he will i
conduct the hotel on the principles that j
made it odious to the people who once
favored it with their patronage. The
Baron has full liberty now to conduct his
gambling parties as frequently as he
pieasea and with whom he pleases. Il
ls free to manage it in what- I
ever way will best suit his manners and |
morals, and perhaps may nhviate the ne
cessity of having his brother booted from j
any more local hotels. The trouble be
tween Baron yon Schroeder and General
Warfield is of long standing.
When General Wariiehl leased the Ho-
I tel Rafael it was with the understanding j
; that the establishment was to be kept
open the entire year. After one year's
experience the manager discovered his
sum of profits were eaten by his winter
I losses and he asked permission to close
! the hotel .hiring the winter and make it
1 distinctively a summer resort. To this
Baron yon Schroeder would not agre.Â».
He Insisted the place be kept open the
entire year. Warfield demurred, but un
der the conditions of his lease was
forced to submit, although he went so far
as to offer Yon Schroeder the rent of the
place for the entire year with the prlvl-

legje of keophiEf it open only during tho
summer months.
Even to this more than fair proposal
Baron yon Sclirocder would not agree.
This was the first but by no means the
most serious cause of the trouble which
led Â«P to the present retirement of War
field. When the hotel first opened every
possible effort was made to make It a
fashionable summer resort for reputable
people.
The Baron and his wealthy wife went
there and helped things along with a
monthly bill of $1100. They remained for
two years, and shortly afterward Baron
ess yon Schroeder went to Germany.
It was the general expectation that her
husband would quickly follow her, but
he found here company more congenial
and remained. Affairs In the Yon
Schroeder household had not been mov
ing as smoothly as might have been de-
Bired. The Baron was expensive. He i
spent money lavishly, and an estate \
which was estimated at over three mil
lion dollars began to dwindle until it
looked like four hundred and fifty thou
sand. A million dollars in bonds of the
Donahue railroad had gone. Gossip
tongues were wagging, and justly bo, for
the Baron took no pains to observe those
conventionalities which hide sometimes
even derelictions.
The Baroness, berore she left for Eu
rope, gave her power of attorney to At
torney Giselman, without whose signature
Baron Yon Schroeder cannot dispose of
any of his wife's property. After the de
parture of the Baroness, the Hotel Rafael
became the scene of incidents which
Conned the second ground of General
Warfield's complaint. Baron Yon richroe
der was even more reckless in his disre
gard of ordinary proprieties.
On more than one occasion he was asked
to desist and respect the feelings of men
and women who could not justly be asked
to submit without protest to insult. But
the Baron was obdurate â he owned the j
hotel. Little by little the story of scan- I
dalous scenes was spread. Rumor ex- I
ag^erated them and men who honor their |
reputation and women who respect their
skirts preferred to go elsewhere for their
summer vacation. The house became
worse than profitless.
It began to lose heavily and TVarfield !
decided if possible to retire. It was Idle
to expect that Yon Schroeder would alter
his mode of life and until he did it was
not to be expected that people worth hav
ing would give their patronage to the ho
tel. Wartlnld therefore induced Yon
Schroeder to release him from the obli
gation of his lease. The Baron did this
with the greatest unwillingness. He has
finally done so and to-day the necessary
documents of release will be signed.
hear a lecture by Rev. Joseph Sasia, S. J.,
entitled "A Wonderful Subject," under
the auspices of Columbia Council No 55
rounij Men's Institute. The programme
â¢ opened with a piano solo by A. E. Magill
â¢ Jr. D. J. Sheehan. president of the coun
cil, made a few Introductory remarks, and
John Desmond sang two tenor solos In
excellent voice.
In his lecture Father Sasia stated that
the subject as announced was but another
name for miracles, which no doubt his
auditors had already realized. He
prefaced his remarks by alluding to the
wonderful physical laws of nature which
regulated the phenomena of the vegetable
animal and human kingdoms, but which
in themselves were submissive Ito tne
hand who had created these laws
"It is the temporary suspension of these
laws, said the reverend lecturer, "by the
Creator whereby he performs miracles in
order to exhibit his divine omnipotence
and to manifest his glory to the world
God performs and has performed actions
above and beyond the ordinary course of
things, as has been attested by the in
! disputable evidence of reliable witnesses
But it is a fact that only the power whir i
has created these physical laws possesses
the wonirous power of suspending them
at will.
Father Sasia then proceeded to prove
three points which sum up the whole
proposition as follows: First, miracles
are possible and can be performed; sec
ond, miracles have absolutely and un
deniably occurred; third, miracles cannot
be accounted for by any material agent
or attributed to any created being but re
j quired for that purpose the omnipotent
i hand of God.

1. NEW WORDS AND HOW TO
USE THEM.
(Continued.)
As a rule it is unwise to use a foreign
word if an English word will express the
intended meaning. There are, however, a ;
j few foreign words which have come into
common use and for which there are no
English equivalents. Our tendency in
language as well as in business is toward
"short cuts." When a foreign word will
express what in English would require an
elaborate sentence the foreign word is to
be preferredâ that is, of course, if the lis
tener understands its meaning. Note the
following:
Esprit de corps. Pronounced "es-pre-de
core. ' Esprit means spirit. This French
phrase is cummonly used by English-speak
ing people in the sense of common uevot
edness, sympathy or support among the
members of an association or a military
company or of any body of men united
for any purpose. Thus we may say, "The
esprit de corps of the London police is
worthy of imitation."
Coup d'etat. Pronounced "coo-day-tah,"
with the last syllable accented. A Dold or
brilliant stroke of statesmanship; an un- ,
expected stroke of policy. A daring move
by which one political party outwits or
defeats another.
Finesse. Pronounced "fi-ness," with the
second syllable accented. This word in ,
French means "fineness," and is com
monly used by English-speaking people to
denote artfulness, craft or adroitness; that
quality of mind which leads to subtle
actions. Note this illustration: "Her use
of finesse in the most trivial affairs gave
one the impression of being constantly
i duped or imposed upon."
Vade mecum. Pronounced "va-de-me
kum." A. book or article which a person
carries with him as a constant companion.
It may be a Baedeker or perhaps a flask
of brandy.
Siesta. Pronounced "see-es-ta." A nap
or period of rest in the middle of the day.
! The hour of siesta is strictly observed in
j the warm countries of Southern Europe.
Bete noir. Pronounced "bate-nwor."
The literal meaning is "black beast." The
expression is commonly used to denote a
pi-t dislike, something which makes us
especially uncomfortable.
These are sufficient to illustrate the
point. Let us now look at a few English
words which we may find to our advan
tage to add to our vocabulary. There is
jno copyright on language. Words are
absolutely free. Custom simply requires
that we use them correctly:
Cynic. Pronounced as spelled. This
! word originally meant dogllke. A cynic
!is a sneering faultfinder. He shows a
disposition to disbelieve or doubt the sin
cerity of others. We say a man is cynical
or that he makes a cynical remark, or '
: has a cynical laugh, when we refer to
; some relation or expression or intimation
which questions the motives or thoughts
of others.
Optimist. Pronounced as spelled. An
' optimist Is one who believes in the ulti
! mate supremacy of good over evil. He
! always hopes for and expects the best. :
;He has a large and broad outlook. His
hopeful disposition keeps him In the best
of cheer.
Pessimist. Pronounced "pess-i-mist,'*
; with the accent upon the first syllable.
; This word means the opposite of "opti
mist." A pessimist is one who exagger
-1 ates the evils of life, or who Is disposed :
to look only on the dark side of things. ,
1 He takes a melancholy or depressing view
;of life. A pessimist In religion believes
i that this world is bad and its tendency is
1 to grow worse rather than better.
! Cant. Affectation in language. If it is i
i evident to the educated or cultured or ex- .
! perienced man that a particular writer or i
speaker does not really mean what he j
says, does not act It out in his own life;
that he is simply making a respectable
I show of words or of thought for appear- !
' ance sake; if this is clear, the speech or \
article is properly called political or re
ligious cant. The word signifies a whin
! ing pretension of goodness; an insincere -
SHOP AND TRADE STUDIES FOR BOYS.
Copyright, 1599, by Seymour Eaton.
I. ARITHMETIC OF THE WORK
SHOP.
Lesson No. 2.
In our first lesson we considered boards
one inch thick and called a square foot a
board foot. A board a foot square and an
inch thick contains 144 cubic inches, so
that if we know the number of cubic
inches in a wood solid we can find the
number of board feet by dividing by 144.
Note the following exercises:
1. How many cubic inches in a block of
wood 2 feet square and 7 inches thick?
2. How many cubic inches in a stick of
square timber 8 inches by 10 Inches and 20
feet long?
3. How many board feet in five sticks of
timber oach 16 inches by 18 Inches and 12
feet long?
4. The lumber of the floor of a piazza of
the shape shown in the diagram is 14
inrhos thick. AB Is 40 feet; CD is 25 feet;
AE Is 36 feet; CG Is 21 feet. Find the
value of the lumber at $48 a thousand
feet.
5. There are 10 supports required for a
bridge. They are all to be of the same
size and of the shape shown In the figure.
A is 18 feet long and 16 inches square; B
and C are each 15 feet long and 16 inches
square. They are billed at the rate of
$48 p p r 1000 board feet. Find the total
amount of the bill.
Noteâ To find the area of a circle mul
tiply half of the diameter (AB) by itself
and multiply the product by 3 1-7. To find
the circumference of a circle multiply the
diameter by 3 1-7.
6, Find the value of the lumber in a cir
cular platform 210 feet in diameter and
use of religious phraseology: an affecta
tion of piety; a sham interest or enthusi-
Ism; false pretenses in society customs.
Finale. Pronounced "fee-naugh-lee,"
with the accent upon the middle syllable.
The concluding section of a piece of mu
sic or of any act of a dramatic work like
an opera, especially if so managed as to
produce an effective climax. The last
piece on a programme: the last part,
piece or scene in any public performance
or exhibition. The concluding act might
properly be called a grand finale.
Travesty. A travesty Is a raricature, a
burlesque, a grotesque or deceitful imita
tion. Our minstrel shows, for instance,
find a drawing card in making a travesty
of some current event or popular drama.
In literature a travesty is a burlesque
treatment of a noble Subjectâ the opposite
of a parodyâ or serious treatment of a
trivial subject. We say that a particular
thing said or dene by another is a trav
esty upon a man's character If the man
is represented Improperly or in burlesque.
Glamour. Pronounced "glam-ur." This
word means illusion; an artificial interest
or association causing things to appear
different from what they really are. Thus
we refer to some of the beautiful stories
which we find recorded in the life of
Washington as the glamour of history.
Sinecure. Pronounced "sy-ne-kure." The
literal meaning is "without care." and
therefore the name is applied to a position
having attached large pay and requiring
little work. Political offices are too often
looked upon by their holders as sinecures.
Correct speech is learned only by care
ful study. We must watch ourselves con
stantly until good English becomes a
habit. When reading it is wise to read
aloud as much as possible. There 1b no
better way of becoming accustomed to
the sound and rhythm of words. Their
proper grammatical relation soon becomes
as familiar to the ear as correct spelling
does to the eye. The ear immediately de
tects a false construction or improperly
used word just as the eye notes a wrong
combination of letters in the spelling.
Note the following cautions:
The words each, every, either and neith
er are followed by singular verbs, as:
"Each of the boys was there." "Either
he or his brother was to be appointed."
"1 am not certain that either of us was
there." "Let every one please himself,"
not "themselves." When singular names
connected by "and" are preceded by each,
every or no the verb must be singular, as:
"Each book and slate was in position."
'"Every man and woman was drowned."
"No chair or desk is to be used in the
room."
As well as and none take singuar verbs.
It is wrong to say "Greek as well as Latin
were studied." It should be "was
studied." "None of up are going" should
be "None of us is going."
Be careful to use the possessive form hi 3
instead of him in such sentences as "I
did not think of his returning so soon."
"If I were in his place." In sentences of
this character use were and not was. It
is incorrect to say "If I was he." Say "If
I were he." "If he was in Tom's shoes
he would think differently." Say "If he
were." It may be put down as a general
rule that in .sentences denoting supposi
tion or doubt the plural form of the verb
should be used.
The words lie and lay are often incor
rectly used. To He means to place one's
self in a horizon taj position; to lay means
to put or place, to spread on the surface.
The book lies on the table, not lays on
the table. I lay down for a few minutes,
not I laid down. I have lain down, not I
have laid down. I have laid it down, not
I have lain it down.
The word either means, strictly, the one
or the other of two; both means two
taken collectively, and each means two
considered separately.
Where this and that, these and those,
the one and the other refer to things
previously mentioned, this and these refer
to the last mentioned, and that and those
to the first mentioped. the one refers to
the first mentioned and the other to the
last mentioned.
The words answer and reply should not
be used indiscriminately. An answer Is
given to a question, a reply to an asser
tion. When we are addressed we answer;
when we are accused we reply.
built of 2-inch plank at $36 per 1000 feet.
7. How many feet of lumber in 50 pack
ing boxes, each 4 feet by 2--2 feet by 2 feet
and made of inch lumber?
Noteâ Consider outside measurements,
ft. How many wood blocks, each 2 Inches
i by 3 inches by 2'i inches, can be cut out
of a stick of timber 10 inches by 12 Inches
i and 9 feet long, making no allowance for
j waste In sawing?
9. An office building of the shape shown
in the diagram has 12 floors. AB la 40
feet, AC is 60 feei. EF is 18 feet, EG is
24 feet. Find the value of the inch floor-
Ing necessary to cover the 12 floors at $60
per 1000 board feet.
10. Find the value of the 2-inch lumbef
necessary in building a 6-foot sidewalk
around a rectangle 40 rods by 20 rods (in
side measurement) at $20 per 1000 board
feet.
Hints and Answers.
(1) 4032 cubic inches. (2) 19.200 cubic
inches. (3) 1440 board feet. Divide the
number of cubic inches by 144. (4) $65 88.
Find the area of the whole rectangle by
multiplying 40 by M. then subtract from
this the area of the shaded portion. This
will leave 915 square feet. Multiply by
the thickness of the floor in inches. This
gives 1372Vz feet of lumber. (5) $491 52. Di
vide the solid contents of the timber in
inches by 144, and the result should be
10,340 board feet. (Â«) J24P4 80 The area of
the circle is 34,650 square feet. (7) 2300
board feet. (8> 864 blocks. (9) $1416 96.
Subtract the area of the smaller rectan
gle from the entire area. (10) $480 96. Do
not count the corners twice.

EASTERN MARKETS,
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 24.â The etock market was
distinctly reactionary to-day In spite of some
etrong spots. Profit taking was on a very large
rcale. Sales ' d this account were quite well
Bbporbed and created no sign of demoralisa
tion in prices. When the fact of profit taking
became obvlouÃ some, of the room traders
turned bears and fold the market moderately.
The bear faction was not aggressive, however,
and made no great inroads upon values. Neither
were the bulls inclined to resume their cam
paifrn for the advance after having taken their
1 : fits and the markets were inclined to drag
during the latter part of the day. Some at
tempt was made to Infuse strength into the
mnriiet in the last hour by bidding up Union
Pacific and Baltimore A Ohio preferred. Busi
ness induced some slight covering by shorts,
but so far as a general resumption of the ad
vance wns concerned the attempt was abortive.
Prices were very unsteady at the close and
In many cases were pursuing a downward
course. The active realizing in the first hour
was much helped by a notabis accession of
outside demand, which was attract"! by yes
terday'B sharp rise following a week of stub.
born resistance to all attempts at driving prices
downward. This demand and continued ma
nipulation by a section of the bull party served
to wipe out pretty generally the opening de
cline find bring- the market back to about last
night's level. Having reached that point the
downward course began and with the exception
of coma irregular fluctuations the market con
tinued heavy, below last night's level for the
rest of the day. Special points of weakness in
the early dealings were Sugar, American To
bacco Malting preferred. Anaconda, Pullman
and Bro6k!yn Transit. Aggressive strength
â was shown all day by united States Leather,
which was taken in enormous lots and roee at
one time to 22*Â«. The closing waa a point be
low that. New York Central, after a small
fractional advance, met very heavy offerings
on the announcement of an additional stock
If3u* of $15,000,000. The stock moved somewhat
Irregularly during the day, within a range of
o point below last night's level. The London
market reflected some depression upon this
market and the undertone there was distinctly
weak on the uneasiness regarding the position
of thÂ« British troops in Natal.- The suggestion
or the Chancellor of the Exchequer that a tax
! on South African gold mines might be looked >
j to to help defray the expenses of the war was
' apparently not relished by the speculators in
the mine market. London sales In this market
; were upward of 30,000 shares. The general |
! weakness of copper mine shares had a de- 1
pressing influence on speculation. The weak- j
â  ness of Anaconda on the exchange was supple- j
mented by a break in Amalgamated Copper In ]
the outside market and by weakness in Bos- ,
ton. The hardening tendency of money was a j
; discouraging factor for the bulls. Most of the 1
day's call loans were made above 6 per cAit I
, and the rate rose to 8 per cent In the day. !
Bankers generally asked 6 per cent for time ;
: loans and were disinclined to put out their
; funds for the longer periods. Rather less
; money was shipped to the interior to-day, but
the outgo, while diminished, still continues.
The sub-treasury Is also absorbing funds.
Realizing was In evidence In some portions
of the bond market, making the price changes
mixed. Total sales, par value, $2,400,000.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Oct. 24.â Disappointing cables \
started wheat rather easy. The market soon I
I began to harden, however, as shorts com
j menced covering from the outset, owing: to re
ports of continued drought in the Southwest,
where much of the fall-sown wheat has not i
yet germinated. Rumors of a sharp break in i
consols caused further apprehension and as i
outside orders began to flood the pit the de- â¢
mand became so urgent that a %c advance was ;
! added to the opening figures during the first
twenty minutes' trading. After that the ups !
I and downs were frequent within a rather nar- ,
row ranee until the last hour, when an in- I
i crease In the world's visible of 4.875,000 bushels, I
where only about 2,000.000 bushels had been ex-
I pected, started liquidation and the market
soon lost -Its previous buoyancy. Reports of a
break in the drought added to the selling move
ment and the early gain was lost. : The mar
ket continued weak the remainder of the ses
j sion and closed at the bottom. A report that
Argentine would have a surplus of over 80.
--000,000 bushels for export this year had a de
pressing influence during the late trading.
December opened He lower at 70%@70%0, ad
vancing to 71HS > 71Vic and declined to 70% cat
the close.
Corn ruled strong and active, but had Us ad
: vancing tendency clogged somewhat by profit
taking. December closed with buyers at 3iy

Oats ruled easy with trade limited. Decem
ber closed 22%c@22%e.
Too many hogs ana lower, prices at the yards
weakened provisions early. Part of the loss ;
was recovered later on buying by packers, but
there was very little animation to the trade.

WHEATâ The feeling was unsettled In sym
pathy with a similar condition at Chicago.
| The demand was fair.
Chicago opened easier on indifferent cables
and â¢ rain -in Southwestern Kansas. Liverpool
was %d higher and consols %d lower. Buyers
were Indifferent. The Northwestern markets
were strong at an advance of He over Monday.
St. â¢ Louis bought' freely, local support â '..' was
given to the market in the shape of . Invest
ment buying, .and a good export movement at
New York was reported.
This firmness was of short duration and
passed away under Bradstreet's figures of
4.500,000 bushels increase in the visible sup
ply, and the bears renewed their attack on

ALLIES OF WORKINGMEN
KTW CHARTER DECISION
CLEARS WAY TO VICTORY.
large and Confident Audiences
Greet Horace Davis and Other
Candidates Every
Night.
The outlook for complete Republican
success at the polls on Tuesday, Novem
ber 7, daily grows brighter. The decision
of the Supreme Court sustaining the new
charter is an inspiration to Republican
workers. Certain Phelanites who have
been trying to arouse apprehension that
the charter was in danger and in need of
the protecting care of the Committee of
One Hundred find that their chief source
of political capital has vanished,
The charter is now secure. It has been
adopted by the people, ratified by the
legislature and its validity is established
by the Supreme Court of the State. It is
now the charter of San Francisco and not
the special property of any gang of place
hunters masquerading as reformers to
catch non-partisan votes.
The Republican party has demonstrated
Its ability to manage the affairs of the
nation and the State, and Republicans
believe that the party is capable of direct
ing the municipal affairs of San Fran
cisco. From the beginning of the charter
agitation until the rinish the charter had
no abler exponents and supporters than
Horace Davis and I. J. Truman. To these
gentlemen and others on the Republican
ticket the citizens owe a debt of gratitude
for intelligent work performed in behalf
of the local constitution. : V- " .
Mayor Phelan is now hedging on the i
proposition that Republicans opposed the
charter lie asserts that he dirt not make
the charge, but with a wave of the hand
and a smile of insinuation cites Joseph
Uritton as authority for the statement. â 
Phelan did charge Republicans with dis
loyalty to the charter, and now brings
Joseph R. Brltton forward as State's evi
dence. Were not the Republicans sincere
in their devotion to the charter when they
placed on their ticket for Supervisor the ;
man salted by Phrlan as the ideal cham
pion of the charter? Did not the nomina- !
tion of Britton attest the sincerity of Re- !
publicans? On what ground, then, can j
Phelan contend- that Republicans were
disloyal?
At headquarters of the Republican
County Committee and the room of the !
Horace Davis Central Club, indications of I
Republican unity and success are ob
served. Out in the districts the party
meetings are large and enthusiastic. In i
the beginning of the campaign fear was
expressed that sufficient interest could
not be awakened in the municipal elec
tion to induce registered Republicans to
turn out ami participate in the demonstra- |
tions of the campaign. The decision of ;
the court holding that all the principal |
offices are to be tilled gives the local con
test the prestige of a general election
and insures a very large vote. In San â 
Francisco a full vote may be accepted as !
a guarantee of Republican triumph. The
fact that the approaching municipal elec- |
tion will be regarded throughout the State
of California and In the East as an en
gagement preliminary to the great battle
of 1900, will stimulate Republicans to
special effort en behalf of the ticket.
I'ndor the leadership of Horace Davis a
groat victory should be gained. He is a I
leader of national reputation, fearless,
able and honest. :
To-night Republicans of the Thirty- j
eighth District will rally at 1032 Golden â¢
Gate nvenue to hear Horace Davis, ,
Colonel T. V. Eddy and Major Kyle.
Th(-so will bo a club meeting to-night \ ,

BOASTFUL DEMOCRACY.
District Meetings Degenerate
Into Societies for Mutual
Admiration.
The Democratic district mass-meetings
have degenerated Into societies for mutual
EcSmlratlnn. The speakers are limited to
ih- candidate* and they limit themselves
r-laudation. The performance has
been repeated s=o often that It ceases to
have even the interest of novelty. In
Progress Hall on Twenty-fourth street
Jast night the usual programme was car
r!Â« 1 our. The Democrats of the Thirty
sixth District crowded the hall and dis
played marked fortitude and patience in
r Mayor Phelan, who did not
arrive until after 10 o'clock. While wait
ing for him the other speakers made their
ordinarily bad speeches worse by making
them ;
Thoso that now occupy public places
told their hearers of ali the reforms that
have been worked in municipal affairs

POSTUM CEBEAL.
"BAD AS LIQUOR HABIT," '
Druggist Says of Ooflee Drinking.
"Drinking coffee at restaurants more
or loss for several yenrs, I was finally
forced to the conclusion that it was
the cause of my dyspepsia, with the
hungry feeling I was continually an-
I with. It caused me not only
distress, but s<-rious Inconvenience. I
am satisfied that the coffee drinking
habit U v truly a pernicious habit as
the drinking of liquor. It made me ex-
ceedingly nervous and interfered with
my business, where a Bteady hand is
a necessity.
"My experience with Postum Food
Coffee teaches that it is truly a blesÃ-
lng, and to be highly recommended.
My own great improvement has given
me interest in the preparation. Mr.
Frank Terrey, a cyclist, at 6713 Vin-
cennes avenue, left off coffee and drank
only Postum during his training 1 forth*
races and was greatly benefited by the
change. C. R. Paterson, another cy-
ueed Postum in place of coffee
nnd saye it gives strength and vigoÂ»
whore coffee causes a feeling of heavi-
ness."â Edgar G. Coates, 86 Van Buren
Btruet, Chicago, IIL
structed his good people patronizingly
how to vote. Charles Wesley Reed mod
estly refrained from a long speech, as he
said he would simply say what the Mayor
would say later and he did not want to
steal any of his Honor's thunder.
Major Geary was even more fiery' than
usual. He has got out on the firing line
now and says he is going to win the bat
tle aa he won battles at Manila. As he
won none there his self-imposed task
ought to be comparatively easy from one
point of view. Dr. R. Beverly Cole re
peated the chaperone performance and
related Incidents of the childhood days
of. the other candidates. As the hour
grew late the difficulty of holding the au
dience became greater. Max Popper, the
chairman, filled in an awkward gap with
a dissertation on the charter and at last
the Mayor came.
Mayor Phelan had no new Ideas to of
fer. He Is still the apostle of progress,
the champion of the people's rights, the
defender of the municipality. Every
thing that is bad or weak In local gov
ernment is the work of his opponents.
Everything good that was ever won for
San Francisco was won by himself ami
he pledged his audience that he will
win some more if they let him. He wants
to be Mayor not for gain nor for honor,
but to serve the people. When the
Mayor had concluded the meeting ad
journed with three cheers for the ticket.
ENTHUSIASTIC RALLY.
Citizens of ths Potrero Gather
and Shout for Horace
Davis.
A rousing meeting: was held last night
by the Thirty-second Republican District
i Slab. Bonfires and music acted as har
bingers and the hall was crowded before
the hour for the candidates' speeches had
arrived. George Wimmer acted as chair
man of the evening.
When Horace Davis, the Republican
candidate for Mayor, walked into the hall
he was greeted with prolonged cheers, but
this was hut a mite compared with the
applause and welcome he received -when
introduced by Chairman Wimmer. Every
period of the Republican candidate was
the signal for cheering and hand-clapping
approbation en the part of the audience,
which was most enthusiastic.
Horace Davis toid his audience of his
position in favor of the charter, of his
career and his solicitude for the â¢working
men He also referred to his labors in
Congress and his success in securing the
passage of the exclusion bill. Taxes and
sewerage Improvement were also consid
ered, and Mr. Davis' views on the one
which advocates a reduction and not an
Increase and a much improved sanitary
st-werage for the city showed accord with
the minds 01 his audience.
Following Horace Davis, Major C. W .
Kyle took the platform, and he spoke of
what the Republican candidate had done
for the working classes and what his ca
reer as a business man had been. "Every
dollar he earned." said Major Kyle, "has
been put into productive industries which
give employment to his fellow-men."
L. Grant Carpentar, nominee for Police
Judge, took the platform. and his remarks
called for lengthy applause. Dr. T. H.
Morris, nominee for Supervisor; Dr. Mc-
Lean, nominee for Supervisor, and other
candidates spoke on campaign issues, and
the meeting adjourned amid the cheers
and expressed determination of the Po
trero Republicans to work for the ticket.
AT GARIBALDI HALL.
Garibaldl Hall, on Broadway near Mont
gomery street, was crowded last night
with enthusiastic Republicans of the
Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Assembly
Districts. George M. Perine acted as
chairman and introduced Colonel T. V.
Eddy as the first speaker. Colonel Eddy
ftaid that since the Supreme Court had de
cided in favor of the* new charter the
Republicans had shown a more deter
mined attitude and were now more con
fident of winning a fight that their oppo
-1 declared at the beginning of the
campaign was hopeless. As election day
approached this confidence asserted itself
in the ranks of the Republican party
Btronger and stronger. Horace Davis pos
sessed all the good traits of his polit
ical opponent and naught could be said
against his character. What he had done
9an Francisco and for California was
a matter of record. "Gentlemen," he
ided, "keep up this fee-ling of con
fldence; take off your c>ats and work
from now on, and on the Bth day of No
vember you will be proud to shake the
hand of our next Mayorâ Horace Davis."
The Knickerbocker quartet favored the
nee with some campaign selections,
and William A. Deane, Charles A. Low
William Watson and W. Z. Tiffany ad-
I the meeting.
Horace Davis then entered the hall and
was loudly cheered as he stepped to the
platform. Mr. Davis, In the course of
his remarks, said that it was his inten
tion, if the people saw fit to make him
Mayor of their city, to give them in re
turn a good, clean and honest adminis
tration.
"I am," he said, "in favor of a new era
for Baa Francisco. I want to see her
placed near the head of the list of fine
cities. A complete sewer system, new
â Ihouses, new hospitals and a fair
pi art toward the goal of commercial proa
pi ritj is what San Francisco is entitled
to. Mr. Davis urged his listeners to
keep up the good work and on election
day elect the Republican ticket from too
to bottom. v
THIRTIETH DISTRICT DEM
OCRATS.
The Democrats of the Thirtieth Assem
bly District met last evening in the San
P'rancisco Athletic Club rooms, at Sixth
and Shipley streets. A bonfire and a
brass band were a part of the attractions
The other attractions were the wander-

THE SA:N FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1899.
PLOT TO OPEN
THE INGLESIDE
RACE COURSE
Secret Planning of
Arch Schemers.
OUTLINE OF THE CONSPIRACY
GOLDEN PROMISES TO THE OUT
GOING SUPERVISORS.
Canvass of the Board Shows That the
Hopes of the Agitators
Are Without Foun
dation.
Ingleside's tragic record of disgrace,
defalcations and death was spread be
fore the world in The Call of Friday,
March 3, 1899. The history of the closing
of the track and the expulsion of the
horde that brought misery, degradation
and death to many households need not
be told again, but it is time to warn the
community that a conspiracy Is hatching
to provide ways and means for reopening
the course.
Of late there have been secret
' gatherings attended by men of the
j Rainey, Crimmins and Lanigan type,
who are plotting to restore the old order
lof things at insleslde. The schemers
believe that the public conscience is dulled
and public vigilance is relaxed. They
: fancy that men sitting in the Board of
i Supervisors may be persuaded or induced
] to view the suppression of racing at
Ingleside in a manner at variance with
1 former views. Corrigan, the "Master of
i Hawthorne," is here taking observations
i and giving the schemers the benefit of his
| advice. While the meetings have been
held in secret The Call has managed to
ascertain the motives and something of
the plans proposed by the conspirators.
The advocates of an open course, where
pool-selling and bookmaking shall be ulti
mately toleruted, do not propose to sweep
away all barriers at the iirst attack, but
hope to gain their ends by gradual ap
! proaches. Their present plan is to care-
I fully sound outgoing Supervisors to ascer
' tain how far they will dare go in opposi
! lion to the pronounced public sentiment
: against the old form of racing and gar
ni bllng at the track. The schemers beiieve
I that some of the Supervisors are about
I ready to weaken. Reports brought In by
: Crimmins, Rainey and Lajilgan may jua
! tify this belief in the secret circles of the
schemers.
An ordinance repealing the existing pro
hibition will not bo recommended, as the
leaders in the movement to reopen Ingle
side are convinced that such an ordinance
would he vetoed by Mayor Phelan. It has
| been suggested, therefore, that efforts be
directed to obtain support of a majority
I of the Board of Supervisors in favor of a
simple resolution allowing races to be
I conducted at the track. It is contended
that the Mayor's objection to such a
resolution would not defeat its purpose,
for tho reason that his signature would
not be r^-iuired to make the resolution ef
fective.
The Call is in possession of information
I obtained by a close canvass of the board,
; that a sufficient number of Supervisors
I cannot be tempted by the golden prom-
Isee of the conspirators and touts to
j change their views of the situation.
BURGLARS MAKE
A BOLD RAID
OF RESIDENCES
The Western Addition
Suffers.
A gang of burglars committed whole
sale burglaries in the fashionable pre
cincts of the Western Addition last night.
] Within two hours four residences were
broken into and looted, and in three cases
the thieves escaped with their booty and
I in each case they succeeded in getting
away without being seen. The police
were notified immediately by telephone to
the Central station, but before the detec
tives arrived the house-breakers were op
erating in other portions of the district.
They first broke into the residence of
: Mrs. S. 11. Proctor at 1917 Webster street.
, Mrs. Proctor was visiting friends, and the
; burglars forced the front door open with
| a "jimmy." They entered the bedrooms
; and carried off clothing, jewelry and other
valuables. The richest haul was made at
the residence of Attorney Barclay Henley,
2131 Green street.
Here they succeeded in carrying off al
most a sackful of valuable silverware
from the dining room, and jewelry, dla
! monds and other valuables from Mr.
: Henley's sleeping apartments. The burg
lars opened the front door with skeleton
; keys.
The lawyer was out at the time, and
it Is presumed that the house-breakers
had a lookout on the other side of the
street to notify them when the oppor
tunity to "touch off" the residence was
ripe. Henley returned shortly after the
burglars left and he immediately reported
the matter to police headquarters. While
the police were looking over Mr. Henley's
residence for a clew the daring thieves
were busily engaged plying their trade in
a residence at 2044 Jones street, where
they wore also successful in getting away
; with valuable jewelry.
Their last effort was at the home of E.
. A. Maxfleld, at 1314 Washington street,
I and here they met with defeat. Mrs.
; Maxfield had just retired when she was
i awakened by footstep* in the front yard.
By the time burglars opened a window
at the rear of the place she was moving
about with a light, thus frightening them
| off. The police visited Mrs. Maxfield's
house shortly after midnight hoping to
get a description of the men.
FREUD'S REGISTRATION.
J. Richard Freud called at the Regis
trar's office yesterday to Â»xplaln the rea
son he had registered from the Butter

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
AN OLD PIONEER HAS
GONE TO HIS REST
BERKELEY, Oct. 24.â One of California's oldest pioneers. James Mc-
Gee, passed away in the university town shortly before 3 o'clock
this afternoon.
Mr. McGee was 85 years of age and came to this State with the
early settlers of '49. A native of Ireland, he crossed to America
as a young man. He was early attracted to California, settling
upon his arrival in Alameda County. The old McGee homestead on Catha
rine street, between Dwlght way and Charming way, dates from the tlni3
of his first settlement here. In the early days the site upon which the
university town is now built was held by a quartet of large land owners,
of which Mr. McGee was one. The other three were F. K. Shattuck, Wil
liam Hillegasa and James Leonard. The four owned about equal tracts of
land. With the death of Mr. McGee the last of the four passes away. They
were all prominently identified with the progress and development of this
city and of this section of the county.
The estate left by the old pioneer consists chiefly of an extent of city
property known as the McGee tract. It comprises some of the most val
uable land in the city, extending over twenty-four blocks, and lying be
tween Addison street, Dwight way, California street and Grove street. A
portion of the tract was recently purchased by the Board of Trustees as
a site for the new City Hall.
Deceased leaves behind two daughters to mourn his lossâ Miss Mary Ellen
McGee and Miss Katherine McGee. The funeral will be held from the old
homestead next Friday afternoon.
DIRECTORS ARE
LOOKING FOR A
GOOD WARDEN
Robert McKillican in
View.
The State Prison Directors are carefully
looking over the field to find a Warden to
fill the vacancy tit the Folsom prison
caused by the death of Charles Aull.
Among the men considered was Thomas
Cunningham of Sail Joaquin. whose ex
tended and able services as Sheriff of that
county are recognized throughout the
State. The Directors, after mature delib
eration have reached the conclusion that
the new Warden at Folsom should be a
man in the prime of life, with an abun
dance of physical vitality and great per
sonal energy.
Recently a numbor of prominent men-
Democrats and Republicansâ held a con-
Cerence and decided to ask Robert Mc-
Killican of Alum-da County to become a
candidate. Thi: suggestion of Mr. McKll
lican's name was received with favor by
several of tho State Prison Directors, as
they recognized in him a man possessing
the qualifications that rendered the late
Ward* n Aull so efficient and acceptable.
When Mr. McKillican was sounded to as
certain if he would serve if elected ho
said to his friends that he was not a can
didate and was not seeking the office, yet
if the Prison Directors should regard him
as a man whose services were needed
and should offer him the position he
would accept the office.
It Is known that Mr. McKillican has the
support of many earnest Democrats and
Republicans. He made an excellent rec
ord as Sheriff of Alameda County, win
ning the confidence and respect of lead
ing men in Doth political parties. In the
political arena he is known as a straight
out Democrat.
The Prison Directors find it no easy task
to discover the material for a first-class
Warden. The man at the Immediate head
of prison affairs should possess a number
of Qualifications. He should be firm,
brave, vigilant, patient and just. Strength
of character should be united with vigor
of mind and body. Those about him and
around him are constantly on the alert
to detect a weak place in his make-up.
In many respects Charles Aull was the
ideal Warden. Men filling subordinate
places had respect for his judgment and
authority and convicts knew that he was
not a weakling. Mr. McKillican Is a
strong, even-tempered, well-balanced man
of sound judgment, resolute In purpose,
but withal patient and kind.
SUCCESSFUL BURGLARS.
Two daring burglars entered the resi
dence of Louis Ferrea at 163S San Jose
avenue last Sunday night, and succeeded
In making quite a rich haul of diamonds,
jewelry and cash. The thieves effected
an entrance to the Ferrea premises by
prying open a window at the rear of the
bOUBe. The doors inpide the house were
all unlocked, so the housebreakers had
free access to every room from the
kitchen to the front parlor. They rifled the
bureau drawers in Ferrea's sleeping
apartments and carried oft valuable jew
elry belonging: to his wifa. Ferrea's gold
watch and chain was taken from his vest
pocket.

CAHILLS COULD NOT
DISMISS DIVORCE SUIT
OAKLAND, Oct. 24.â After the scoring
she received at the hands of Superior
Judge Greene yesterday Mrs. Margaret
Cahill, who is being sued for divorce by
her husband. Christopher C. Cahill,
seemed more inclined to-day to settle mat
ters out of court.
When the matter of counsel fees and
costs came up again this morning It de
veloped that ihe parties had called at the
County Clerk's office, stating that they
desired the whole proceedings dismissed.
A blank had been given them, such as
is used for dismissals, and this they had
signed, but Judge Greene declined to rec
ognize the same as final, advising that
the dismissal could not very well be ac
complished without the consent of their
attorneys. The matter, therefore, was
once more continued until next Monday
to enable them to arrange matters with
their attorneys.
SHORT LIVED LOVE.
OAKLAND, Oct. 24.â Edward R. Per
rin of Alameda, who just one month ago
to-day led Mrs. Sarah Johnson to the
altar at San Leandro â¢as his bride, has
come to the s-ad realization that when age
meets age in matrimony then comes the
tug of war with more attending sorrows
than aged bachelorhood in all its loneli
ness.
When Perrin married Mrs. Johnson on
Sunday, September 24, he had just passed
his seventieth birthday anniversary, and
the ancient bride was but six years his
junior. He had previously occupied com
fortable apartments in an Alameda home,
while she owned a cozy cottage at San
Leandro, so that companionship was
rather inviting to them in their lonely
singleness, and many friends extended
congratulations upon the supposed good
fortune of the two souls meeting to enjoy
in comfort their declining years.
But when the aged groom abandoned
his bachelor quarters for the homestead
uf liis bride at San Leandro, peace and
happinrss soon flew away in opposite
directions, for with the responsibilities
that rest upon a husband's shoulders
came the necessary drag upon his purse
fof the purchase of many necessary
household articles and kitchen utensils,
and. If the st<sry now told by some of
their friends be true. Mr. Perrin found
that while he had looked upon matrimony
as an opportunity to save his dollars more
than formerly, Mrs. Perrin had looked
upon it in the same light from her side,
and further, if reports be true, he did not
ivlish the idea of spending his money and
his wife saving hers. A discussion of
finance? waxed Into a heated debate and
finally Pc-rrin tnok his clothes and left, ,
and now P^rrin resides in Oakland, while I
his bride of a month is ensconced in her
lonely cottage meditating over the next
step to take in her troubles.

MINERS BID GOOD-BY TO-DAY
California Association
Accomplishes Much
for the Industry in
Which It Is
Interested.
A New Board of Officers
Will Be Elected at
the Meeting to
Be Held This
Morning.
The California Miners' As
sociation decided yesterday
that the State should take up
thÂ« matter of water conserva
tion and not wait for national
aid.
Senator Perkins advised
the delegates that their fight
for a Secretary of Mines and
Mining was almost hopeless.
Reports of Secretary Ben
jamin and the various com
mittees showed the associa
tion to be in a most prosper
ous condition.
Last evening the delegates
from the Western States were
banqueted at the Palace.
To-day the association â will
elect a new board of officers.
In the afternoon the delegates
â¢will be the guests of the
Union Iron Works in an ex
cursion on the bay.
THE miners of California and the
visiting delegates from the States
west of the Kocky Mountains will
complete the business of their an
nual session to-day. The most im
ot matter which the convention
will dispose of will be the election of
a new board of officers, which was post
: from yesterday's session. The
reading and disposal of the'reports of the
various standing: committees occupied
much of the time of the convention's
Becond day. From the miners' point of
\ i.'\v, these reports wore of more than
Og interest, and they were instruc
tive as well to every Californian and, in
, every resident of the West.
ral able addresses were made,
among these being the remarks of Ben
ator George C. JVrkins, abounding as ]
.iid In reminiscences of the early
days of mining in the Golden State. i
The subject of the conservation of flood
: a difference of opinion ]
n the Miners' Association and the ' i
National Irrigation Congress, represented M
eorge H. Maxwell. Mr. Maxwell i
vehemently protested against the move- i
rd local action in the matter, 1
arguing that if the miners would be pa- <
tient the National Government would give I
the assistance nought, but that if the <
did not pull together the great na- s
lionai Irrigation agitation was ill danger of j
falling through. The convention was not 1
in harmony with Mr. Maxwell, and among j
the r> idopted was one in direct i
opposition t" his plea.
ined the proceedings :
of yesterday's session promptly at the
appointed hour. The first announcement j
in invitation to the delegates from'
Henry T. and Irving M. Scott to visit the I
Vnion Iron Works and enjoy an excursion I i
on the bay as their guests. The offer was
accepted with thanks by the convention.
The miners will leave Mission pier No. 2
In tugboats at - o'clock this afternoon, ! \
and after inspecting The iron works will i
cruise about the bay until about 5 o'clock. â 
Juiltrp Saarls suggested gi-ving a banquet <
at the Palace to the visiting delegates. I â 
and at his request the chairman asked â¢
nil those who would attend to arise. A i
few strae-trlers stood up. and whi>n noses |
counted it was found that there
KING GEORGE OF
FUG ISLAND
DROPS IN AGAIN
Here on the Schooner
Eliza Miller.
Goorge Grelg, King of the Fanning
group, arrived from his capital on Wash
ington Island yesterday. He came up on
the schof ncr Eliza Miller, making the
voyage in thirty-two days, and reports
that very f< w changes have taken place
In his domain since he was last in San
Francisco. Washington is now the most
productive island of the group. The cocoa
nut trees on the other islands are not
bearing as well as they did five years ago
and new groves are being planted. There
has been very little sickness in the group
and the natives are contented and happy.
King Greig's son and heir was educated
in San Francisco, but he did not come up
with his father on this occasion. Next
. however, when the copra ship
comes to San Francisco, Prince Grelg
â¢will pay the city a visit. The Eliza Mll
, ler brought up IGS tons of copra and will
take back a supply of provisions for the
â Islanders.
The little Bchooner SadiÂ« arrived from
Kodlak yesterday after a passage of
tw< nty-flve days. She Is only four tons
burden, and yet two men navigated her
that 1750 miles of stormy sea and
reached the Gold'-ii Gate without a serious
mishap. Captain Lane says he and bis
companion ltft Kodiak on September 30.
For a wtek they had good weather and
then It began to bluw. The little schooner
Btood up to it well, however, and they
came out of the 6torm without any dam
age. Off the mouth of the Columbia
Kiver it blew a hurricane and the little
boat lay to a drag anchor without a Btltch
of canvas on her for twenty-four hours.
Captain Lane considers her as stanch a
little craft as ever was built, and says ha
would not be afraid to go around thÂ«
â world in her.
The Hawaiian sugar crop is nearly all
marketed now and many of the fleet are
returning to San Francisco in ballast.
The barkentlne S. G. Wilder came up in
i) days, the best run of the season.
The bark Annie Johnson came up in thir
teen and the barkentine Omega in six
days. The British bark Auldglrth
made the run from Iquique in sixty-two
days and the British ship William Tillie
from Newcastle, Australia, in seventy
eix days. There were sixteen arrivals yes
terday and all of them had fair weather
passages. The Umatllla was a few hours
late, owing to a strong head wind that
lasted all the way from Flattery to San
Francisco.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Gaelic sailed for Hongkong
via Honolulu and Yokohama yesterday.
She took away every passenger she could
.iccommodate and every pound of freight
fihe could carry. There were 98 cabin
passengers, 666 Chinese and 28 Japanese
In the steerage and 39 Chinese who werÂ©
deported by the courts. The exodus of
<"hlnese is due to the desire of the Mon
golians to spend the new year holidays at
home. Among the cabin passengers waa
Bishop Potter of New York, who in going
to Honolulu and thence to Manila on a
vielt. Mrs. &. T. Osborne. wife of the Pa
cific Mall Company* agent at Yokohama,
were but twenty-one hungry miners in
the convention. The Judge was astounded
at the result, but he was equal to the
emergency, and in a ringing speech
turned the tide in favor of the feed, and
had nearly every delegate in the hall
shouting for the spread before he had
finished.
"Shame on California," he said, "if she
cannot keep up her reputation for liber
ality and hospitality at this time and en
tertain these guests of ours as they de
serve as the representatives of the great
est industry of our nation. Boys, get up
on your hind legs and attend this banquet
to-night!" And the "boys" stood up,
every mother's son of them.
Following this President Neff called
Senator Perkins to the platform. As the
gentleman arose from the body of the
assemblage and started for the stage he
was greeted by a mighty cheer. He said:
"I did not come here to talk but to
greet my old friends. Like most of you,
I have spent many of my days polishing a
drill or running a tunnel to a vein that
pitched the wrong way." He eulogized
the miners, stating that through their
work the credit of the country had been
placed on a footing equal to that of any
nation of the world. He congratulated
Ithe association for the good work it had
done In the past eight years In benefiting
and developing the great industry in
which its members were interested. j
Speaking of the miners' determination to
have created the Secretaryship of Mines
and Mining, he said:
"It is all right for you to fly your kites
high, but I do not think there Is any prob
ability of such a position being created
for many years to come. You may secure
a Commissioner of Mines and Mining,
which will bring about the very object in
view. I speak advisedly. The commer
cial interests of the nation have been try
ing for fifteen years to get a Secretary of
Commerce, without success. There are
already too many heads in the Cabinet. I
I hope this convention will take a prac
tical view of the situation and take what
it can get. "With you I rejoice in Califor
nia's resources. No one loves to sing her
praises better than I, and no one takes
more glory in it; but we must remember
i that there are other great States. The
coal and Iron industries demand recog
i nition, and we must work with them if
I we expect to accomplish anything in the
direction indicated. "We cannot be a com
munity within ourselves.
1 "If judge Searls and I had our way, the
miners of the State would have every
thing they asked for. They deserve noth
ing but prosperity and happiness, and I
would like to see them go down the In
cline of their lives on a pathway strewn
with roses. I never forget that I am your
servant, and all that I have or expect to
tret I owe to the good people of Cali
fornia."
Lafe Pence was given a seat in the con
was also a passenger. Mrs. Osborne is
the daughter of the late Captain Shot
well, managing director of the Merchants'
1 Exchange. As the Gaelic passed out
through the heads John Hyslop, the ex
, change reporter at Point IÂ»bos, dipped

COLLIDE IN COURT
CHARGES OF BLACKMAILING
AND COWARDICE.
Warm Morning Session With Oppos
ing Attorneys in Bellicose At
titudes Makes the Air
Smell of Powder.
Evidence in the sensational Hite divorce
case, conducted before Judge Jones of
Martinez, in the offices of Van R. Pater
son, was as nothing compared with the
bellicose demonstrations of the interested
attorneys in the trial of the case yester
day morning and afternoon. Every vari
ety of bad blood was shown and the talk
was all of blackmail, cowardice, pistols
fr>r two or three and blood-stained fields,
where honor's battles have been fought
to the mortal finish.
William S. Church, one of the attorneys
for the Indian woman, was on one side of
the lingual war and W. W. Foote, who

accomplished fact and the two sections,
proud in the protection afforded to each
by a generous government, will, aiding
each other, reach that prosperity which
their unparalleled resources unfettered
will bring te all."
J. M. Gleavea spoke on the subject of
the conservation of flood waters. He ar
gued that the State should issue bonds
for the construction of the necessary res
ervoirs. He was strongly opposed to
waiting for national aid. "The Lord helps
him who helps himself." he said, "and if
we do not do something in this important
matter there is little probability of any
thing being done."
This called forth a hot retort from
George H. Maxwell, representing the Na
tional Irrigation Congress. He advised
the convention to proreed with the great
est care and not to make any mistake in
the matter. He did not believe it was
possible for anything to be accomplished
in the line Indicated without the aid of
the National Government. "The people
who need water for Irrigation and mining
should Join hands with those who want
protection from floods," he said. "Do not
go by yourselves and throw cold water
on this great national undertaking."
An interesting paper on petroleum min
| Ing was read by A. H. Ricketts. At to
' day's meeting he will introduce a resolu-
I tion asking Congress to give the same
rights to those prospecting for petroleum
as Is now accorded lode miners in running
their tunnels.
Resolutions were adopted indorsing all
of the recommendations made by the va
rious committees: pledging unfaltering
support to the Caminettl act; approving
the plans of the Governor of Colorado for
a miners' convention to take up the mat
i ter of a Secretary of Mines and Mining;
asking Congress to open Pyramid Lake
and Walker Lake, Indian reservations,
Nevada, situated in the mineral regions;
I Indorsing a uniform system of mining
) laws rules and regulations throughout
! the United States.
The chairman appointed the following
committee to revise the association s con
stitution and by-laws, to report at the
next annual convention: B. S. Rector, S.

represents Millionaire Hite, was on the
other. Hardly had Judge Jones called the
morning session when Attorney Church
arose with his grievance engraved upon
his countenance. On Thursday last, in
the absence of Church, Attorney Foote
made charges of attempted blackmail
against Church. For three days the lat
ter has been nursing his wrath and it
burst on the courtroom yesterday morn
ing and nearly resulted in some sort of
a mixup.
Church's denunciation of Foote was
bitter, insinuating that he was born on
the "dark and bloody ground" and would
not lie dormant when his honor was as
sailed. John A. "Wall, another attorney
representing the Indian woman, had also
been singed by Foote's charges and he
entered his throaty forces in the charge
against the common enemy. From time
to time the court was called upon to force
a speedly conclusion of the war-talk, but
the tide could not be stemmed. Finally
W. W. Foote arose and half scornfully
half seriously threatened to exterminate
the entire opposition. He said he Was
ready for them all or one at a time,
whichever they preferred and whichever
way they wished to take their medicine
The strained relations continued
throughout the day. During the after
noon session, while Attorney Hanlon was
examining John R. Hite, Foote objected
to Hanlon's method of questioning the
witness. One word led to another, "Foote
concluding by softly remarking to Han
lon that there was enough bull-baiting
going on in the trial and that it had better
be discontinued for the good of all or else
something would happen. Later on Hanlon
asked a question of the witness to which
Foote objected. Hanlon then arose and
excitedly cried out that it was the most
important thing in his life â the day on
which the marriage license was obtained.
Foote replied that if the case continued
there would be some more important
things "in the life of others of us," re
ferring to himself, Hanlon and Van R.
Paterson. Again, the suggestion of
powder and guns was in the air.
Several important witnesses were put
on the stand yesterday. In the afternoon
John R. Hite was called by the plaintiff,
who attempted to show that the license
for the defendant to wed Cecilia Nouges
was taken out October 11 or 12, 1597, and
on the 13th, when the marriage was con
summated, Hite was not in a condition
to know what he was doing. Much time
was consumed in eliciting from Hite just
what times he was present at the Indian
Peak Ranch, but nothing positive was ob
tained except the acknowledgment of a
visit in 1893.
The witness who furnished the comedy
part of the melodrama was John Fergu
non, the keeper of a roadhouse near Hite's
Cove, some thirteen miles from Mariposa.
He lived in that part of the country,
knew Hite, the Indian woman and re
ferred to her as Mrs. Hite, but in cross
examination he admitted that she was
known by a number of men's names. The
attorneys for the plaintiffs tried to prove
that Ferguson knew of the relations be
tween Hite and the so-called Mrs. Hite.
Arthur Rodgers was put on the stand
and he told of a visit paid him by F. \V.
Berlin with an offer to compromise the
case. Berlin offered $13,000, but Rodgers
declared that $30,000 was the minimum fig
ure, with an acknowledgment of wifehood
for his client. He also admitted that
money had been advanced by himself
and Attorney Hanlon for the prosecution
of the case. The action will be taken up
at 10 o'clock to-day.
Bouton Must Stay in Jail.
George P. Curtis applied yesterday to
the United States District Court for a
â¢writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Victor
Bouton, the petition alleging that Bouton
is restrained of his liberty by Chief of
Police Lees, in defiance of law, under a
warrant for grand larceny issued by a
Justice of the Peace of Humboldt County,
Nevada.
Judge de Haven refused to issue the
writ because it did not appear from the
petition that the imprisonment of Bouton
was in violation of the constitution or of
any law or treaty of the United States.

MURDERER WINTERS
TEMPORARILY SAVED
WARDEN ATJXL'S DEATH SUS
PENDS THE EXECUTION.
Harry Winters, under sentence of death,
will have a few more days on earth be
fore his neck is submitted to the noose.
He was to have been executed on next
Friday at the State prison at Folsom, but
the recent death of Warden Aull has de
layed that event.
It will be remembered that on the night
of November 17, 1&97, Winters and a fel
low named C. H. Reynolds entered the
Grand Hotel at South San Francisco, San
Mateo County, and attempted to rob the
landlord and guests. There was a sharp
I fight in which a number of shots were
fired by the robbers and one bullet struck
Charles A. Andrews with fatal results.
The murderer escaped and was not cap
tured for a number of days. In time he
was sentenced to pay the death penalty
â  for hid crime and Warden Aull was the
| State official who was directed to execute
I the sentence.
Soon after Mr. Aull's death the Prison
I Directors met and failed to select a sue
| cessor to the late Warden. However, they
j appointed R. J. Murphy aa deputy
Warden with powers to attend to the
business and duties of the Warden. Mur
phy was not sure aa to whether this au
thority empowered him to execute the
sentence of death in Winters' case, and as
the time set is next Friday he requested
an opinion of the Attorney General. Mr.

matters, decided that Murphy Is not
under the law authorized to carry out the
sentence of the court in such a case.
Y\ hile in the usual run of business the
acting Warden may transact the business
of the higher officer, it would be unsafe
to do so under the circumstances
Attorney General Ford suggests two
courses that the deputy Warden may pur
sue. One is that the prisoner may be re
moved to the court and resentenced, the
execution to be held in San Quentln
Prison by the Warden of that institution.
The other is that the Governor may be
induced to reprieve the prisoner until
some certain date, and in the meantime
the Prison Directors would appoint a
regular Warden. In any event Winters
will be allowed to live a few days longer.
