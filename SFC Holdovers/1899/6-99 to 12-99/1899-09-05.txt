A dispatch to the Daily Mail from
Delagoa Bay says the refugees from
Barberton declare that they were
v arced to leave, as the Boers intended
to cordon the district. â¢
There are numerous other dispatches
giving rumors as to war - plans and
! preparations, the probable attitude of
the natives and possible developments.
Among the crowd of conflicting dis
patches from South Africa regarding
the Transvaal situation, it is still Im
possible to Fay exactly what has hap
pened. It seems evident, however, that
President Krager has withdrawn the
five-year franchise, which was depend
ent on Great Britain's acceptance of
. Impossible conditions regarding suzer
ainty and has made some sort of tem
pcrizir.g counter suggestions regarding
a conference.
The Standard and Digger News gives
v.hat purports to be a report of the se
cret session of the Volksraad on Satur
day. According to this account, the
Vo'lksraad not only determined to.re-
the five-year proposal, but also di
rectly opposed President Kruger's visit
ing Cape Town, and resolved to make
a **taud for the abrogation of England's
c'aim to suzerainty. The Boer organ
then asserts: "The Government, both
the Raads and the Burghers, fee! that
they have offered all they intend to
offer and are now resolved to stand or
fall by this decision."
Boer statements of this kind, coupled
v.ith the arrests at Johannesburg. speak
louder than the wriggling pretenses of
Pretoria about arriving at an under
standing. Certainly Mr. ;: -penny
and' other refugees will not be In a
hurry to return to Johannesburg on ac

ciple to a conference at Cape Town. M.
Pakeman, editor of the Tr.ansvaal
Leader, has been released under Â£500
bail, and the charges against him have
been reduced from treason to violation
of the" press laws.
The afternoon papers take the view
that if the foregoing dispatch is cor
rect. President Kruger's reply is
ominous, as it was palpably made to
gain time.
Sir Alfred Miner's suggestion of a
further conference at Cape Town was
instigated with the sole purpose of con
sidering details and for the enforce
ment of the concessions offered by the
Boers. If these concessions are with
drawn there can be no object, from a
British point of view, for parleying
longer. The only Inference to be drawn
is that the Boers have taken Mr. Jo
seph Chamberlain, the ' Secretary %jf
State for the Colonies, at his word in a
broader ser.se than he intended and
that they new want to begin negotia
tions' over again on an entirely new
basis.
The shrewdness of this reported
move is not likely to save it from being
interpreted, by the British Government
as a thinly veiled defiance, and unless
it is accompanied by a vague agreement
to further confer it would .generally be
taken as sufficient cause. *er immediate
hostilities.
Regarding the exact terms of the re
ply In question, reports continue mys
tifying in contradictions, but all agre*
that the excitement in Johannesburg is
unabated and that the exodus from that
city is continuing and that distress
there is Increasing. Cablegrams from
Boer and British South Africa sources
detail war preparations cm all sides.
The pessimistic view of the Trans
vaal situation indicated by the after
noon" papers is strengthened by a well
denned rumor that a Cabinet council
has been hurriedly called and an evi
dent feeling at the Colonial Office that
the crisis has become more acute.
PRETORIA, Sept. 4.â The reply of
the Transvaal Republic to the demands
of Great Britain increases the term of
years' residence necessary to obtain the
franchise.
In connection with the arrest of Mr.
Pakeman. editor of the Transvaal
Leader, and the threatened arrest of
other Outlanders, the State Attorney
denies that instructions were ever is
sued at Pretoria for these arrests or
that any political arrests were con
templated, and says warrants were is
sued at Johannesburg by a subordinate
without consultation with the State's
Attorney. This announcement tends to
quiet the public mind and to arrest the
exodus.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
PORT TOWNSEND. Wash., Sept
4.â The fate of Captain" Henry of
the American ship Cyrus Wake
field, while rounding Cape Horn,
seems to be shrouded In mystery,
according to mail advices received here
to-day from Port Stanley. â  Falkland
Island. On August 14 reports reached
this city to the effect that Captain
Henry of the Cyrus Wak- field, while
rounding Cape Horn, v.as killed by be
ing dashed against the cabin of his ves
sel by an immense sea, which swept the
deck of the ship. According ip letters
received here to-day by E. Biggs
from his brother, Alfred Biggs, who is
an undertaker at Port Stanley, it ap
pears that Captain Henry met death at
the hands of his mate, who during the
heat of passion, hit Captain Henry on
the head with a carpenter's hammer,
and after the deed was committed loot
ed the cabin of all valuables. Accord
ing to the letter. Captain Henry had
been dead three days when the vessel
put into Pert Ftanley, and the sailor
say that th-? mate wanted to run to
Montevideo, but the sailors absolutely
refused to do duty unless the first port
was made as they claimed that by run
ning to Moni^vid^o the body would
have decomposed and necessitated a
burial at sea.
Upon arrival at Port Stanley the
body was taken ashore and turned over
to the Coroner. The m&te refused to
allow the sailors to go ashore, and he
was the only one who gave' testimony
at the inquest. Just before the Wake
field arrived at Port Stanley the jnan,
at the wheel when Captain â  Her ;y\Tfrs
supposed to have been kided by the
shipping of a heavy sea was hit on the
head by, the mate and knocked sense
less, and when he came to himself the
mate threatened to kill him uhleaa he
kept quiet.
According to the letter, after the body
of Captain Henry was taken ashore at
Port Stanley and the inquest was held,
the only witness being the male, a ver
dict was rendered that the captain met
death by being thrown against the
cabin by the vessel shipping a sea.
Th? mate forsook his post of duty and
tcok the first steamer leaving port,
when he was the proper person to take
the vessel to the port of destination.
Biggs, the writer of the letter, says
the action of the mate caused a sus
picion of foul play. The mate was
smoking high-priced cigars and was
spending money elaborately until after
the inquest was held over the remains
of the captain, when he suddenly dis
appeared, leaving the ship without a
master. Captain Chipman of the
wrecked ship John R. Kelly, with th-="
crew of that vessel, took command and
sailed for San Francisco.
The crew of the Wakefield left here
say that the mate was responsible for
the death of Captain Henry.
'I took charge of the body," says
Bisrgs, '"and placed it in a lead coffin.
While handling the body I noticed a
hole in the head, which ha* the appear
ance of having been made with a blunt
Instrument, but there were' no other
bruises on the body. Upon the arrival
of the body of Captain Henry at San
Francisco the casket should be opened,
and an examination of the remains
made, and I am certain that the fact
would be revealed that Captain Henry
met death through foul pay. The cap
tain had a biz hole in the back of his
head and since the inquest, the ship
carpenter says his hammer has disap
peared.

SCHURMAN HOPES FOR AN
EARLY END OF THE WAR
WASHINGTON. Sept. 4 â The Cabinet
to-day was in session for more than two
hours, and a variety of matt- which
have accumulated during the Presidents
absence were discussed, j
It was Secretary Root's first â  attend
ance, the other membe.rs present bting
Secretary Hay. Secretaries Gage. Hitch
cock and Wilson. President Schurman
of the Philippine Commission was also
present by invitation and made a compre
hensive statement of the situation in UK
islands.
It is understood that within th- next
two or three days he will make â  a - state
ment to the press which will cover nls
observations on the islands, and later will
make a formal report to the President
covering the subject in detail.
This report, however, will not be made
until the other members of the commis
sion arrive in Washington and not until
after Admiral Dewey's return. It is un
derstood that Mr. Schurican takes a
hopeful view of the situation in the Phil
ippines and has m> doubt that with- In
creased forces comparatively" short work
will be made of Aguinaldo and the insur
gent forces. He stated tnat although
Aguinaldo is the leader of a very strong
faction of the natives, he. does not- by
any means fairly represent the entire
population, a considerable number ap
pearing to be more or less inoitferent a*
to the outcome of the insurrection. Al
though the work of the anti-Imp-.
League has had no considerable influence
among the soldiers in the army. Mr.
Schcrman said it certainly had given
great encouragement to Aguinaldo and
riis followers.
The influence of the league In this
country. Mr. Schurman thought, had
beÂ«-n ina emitted by the insurgent leaders
ar.d has 'had the effect of giving them
heart end a. ttrong hope of ultima! suc
cess.

the subject much thought. He will co
operate with the committees of Congress
when that matter comes up for settle
ment, but it is certain that he will not
formulate any hard and fast system of
government and insist upon its adoption.
The subject of relieving- General Otis
from a part of his duties as the head of
both the civil government and th& mili
tary forces was not mentioned at to-day's
meeting, although there is a growing im
pression that he may be put at the head

SAYS FILIPINOS CANNOT
GOVERN THEMSELVES
WASHINGTON, Bepi B r.ator Car
ter of Montana, in an interview with a
Post reporter to-day, said that in his
opinion the war in the Philippines -would
' nuary 1. Then, he said,
would come the question of the future
disposition of the Islands. The Repub
lican party, he believed, would settle this
question by insisting on the retention of
the Philippines as a matter of business
profit.
â¢Th:>." added the Senator, "is a prac
tical age. We are going to deal with this
â¢Inn on the basis of dollars and cents.
If the American people believe that the
Philippines are going to help us. the;
never let the islands go. If. on the other
hand, they find that the Philippines mean
a constant drain and small returns, you
will find the verdict of the psople to be
against permanent retention. Neither re
ligion n - m atiment will have mv I
Suence in determining the verdict. The
great question will be. Will it pay? If
we can show the country that >t will, as
1 think we can. the American flae will
never come down from the Philippines.
PEICE FIVE CEXTS.
"Three suggestions as to government
will undoubtedly be made. The first will
be to abandon the islands entirely to tha
natives, I do not believe this will meet
the approval of the American people. The
second will be to seize the islands In a
firm grasp, assuring the people that we
mean to give them a better government
than they could enjoy under any other
flag or could create for themselves, but
that we are the masters and propose to
remain so. Then, the third proposition
will be to throw a loose string- around the
people, holding their seaports and cus
tom-houses with our navy, but allowing
them absolute freedom in their Internal
affairs. This freedom, in my judgment,
would soon become anarchy, and we
would have to rule anyway, so I should
say that the second prop-". is the one
that ought to be adopted. The firmer
we are in our administration the more re
spect will those people have for us.
"As tc the form of government." con
tinued Senator Carter. "I should say that
a Governor ought to be appointed by the
President with a Council also selected
by him. There might be a Filipino Leg
islature composed of prominent men from
each of the islands to discuss questions
and advise" the Governor. I don't approve
of a commission. I think the authority
ought to be vested in a responsible head,
not spread through several commissions.

IS AGREED ON
Few Minor Questions to

INGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON.
Sept. 4.â Great Britain and the United
States have practically agreed upon a
temporary line denning the boundary
between Alaska and Canada. Negotia
tions now in progress relate only to
minor questions growing out of the
definition of the line.
One of the unsettled questions relates
to the status of mines owned by Ameri
cans which may lap over into territory
which lias been under control of Can
ada. Representatives of American mine
owners say that it would bo unfair to
Ajnerican miners if no provision should
be made for them in cast their proper
ty should lie half on the American and
half on the Canadian side of the line.
The prospective settlement of the
boundary question 1b due to conces
sions made not only by Great Britain
but by this Government also. Secre
tary Hay has won in the matter of ex
cluding Canada from the Lynn Canal,
but a port of entry on the canal will
be given should final settlement fail to
give Canada a permanent harbor. The
Secretary has also been successful in
keeping the British tn the north of the
village of Kluckwan, though, it is said,
he has agreed to the placing of the line
just above the village, lnsttad of four
miles beyond as originally demanded.
Secretary Hay laid the late corre
spondence In the controversy before
the Cabinet at its session to-day, and
considerable satisfaction with it was
expressed by the President and mem

The resolutions adopted, after indors
ing the Chicago platform and declaring
In favor of Bryan, are as follows:
Resolved, That the war carried on by
President McKinley in the Philippines is
a grossly immoral ass;. on the Amer
ican principles of government, and a
cruel and brutal attempt to crush a weak
people, bravely contending for the exer
cise of the natural and God-given right of
self-government. ... /
solved, That we severely condemn
the action of President McKinley in rela
tion to the Philippines in conducting the
most cowardly and unjustifiable war car
ried on in the history of the Republic
against a people who are to all intents
and purposes fighting to secure the same
blessing of freedom that the American
revolutionists fought for in 1776 â and also
as a gross perversion of power given to
him: and we hereby call upon ail lovers
of liberty to do their utmost to preserve
the spirit of freedom that inspired our
fathers, and which is being threatened by
the un-American desire for foreign con
quest, and by the destruction of civil
power at home by a spread of militarism.
We are also opposed, to entangling al
liances with foreign kingdoms and em
pires.

Grand Army of the Republic was form
ally inaugurated. Colonel Jo-hnson
was accompanied by the posts of Cin

large reception committee, headtd by
! General Louis Wagner, chairman of
[ the local executive committee, met the
I commander at the railway station and
escorted him to his headquarters. Every
incoming train is bringing its quota of
veterans and visitors and the streets
are thronged. To the visitors and
Philadelphia alike, the Avenue erf Fame
is the point of greatest interest.
Early to-day the liver front was
thronged with visitors anxious to see

SEARCH FOR THE
DUNHAM SKELETON
Sheriff Langford Work
ing Systematically.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 4.â Sheriff Langford
and Deputy Sheriff Rives left this
morning for Pacheco Pass to search for
the skeleton found in the hills there by
Ralph Keeler of Visalla, while making
a bicycle trip to San Francisco. On his
return home Keeler stopped here and
Sheriff Lanpford and others accompan
ied him to Pacheco Pass.
Keeler lost his way when coming
from Visalia and it was while wander
ing through the hills that he came upon
the skeleton. He finally found the road
near the Mountain House. When he re
turned with the officers he was unable
to locate himself. Keeler said he was
sure he could find the skeleton if he
went back near Los Banos and then
into the hills. He had to return at
once to Visalia and promised to
come up again when Sheriff Lang
ford wanted him. When Keeler reached
home he wrote to Langford that he was
sure ho could find the place where the
skeleton was located, as he had found
where he left the road on his trip
home.
The Sheriff at once wired him to come
up and Keeler arrived at Los Banos
last night. This afternoon Langford
met him near the Mountain House,
about half way between Gilroy and
Los Banos. A systematic search has
| been commenced Cor the remains. The j
Sheriff and posse have made their head
â  quarters at the San Luis ranch, from
i which place they will conduct their op
erations.
Many people believe the skeleton te
Dunham's. When the Campbell mur
! derer left the hills at Smith Creek, it
\ was always supposed he went south in
I the direction of Pacheco Pass. Four
nights after the murder a man answer
ing Dunham's description slept in a
barn at the Mountain House, and fled
Into the hills when he saw a man ap
; proaching the barn.
Deputy Sheriff Gardiner took the trail j
iat that point and followed It to a |
1 spring, within a couple of miles of
where the skeleton was found. At the
spring, where the man had drunk, was
found a couple of sacks folded as if
they had Ueen worn on the feet. When
seen at Smiths *'reek Dunham had \
sacks wrapped around his feet.
It is thought the remains, if they be
| Dunham's, can be identified by the
clothing or by the filling in his teeth.
When seen at Smiths Creek Dunham
had a soft brown hat, dark cutaway j
coat and vest and pants; white shirt I
River. Rear Admiral Sampson and
Captain Chadwick. chief of staff, were
in the first carriage.
The fourth division was composed of
the National Association of Naval Vet
erans, United Slates of America, J. R.
Foss commanding; Captain William F.
Larselerie, chief of staff.
In the fifth division were the inde
pendent organizations of naval veter
ans.
President McKinley and his party ar
rived here at 9 o'clock to-night after
a four hours' run from Washington, i
The Presidential party was met at the
railroad station by Mayor Ash bridge, ;
General Louis Wagner, chairman of the j
executive committee, and a number of I
other city officials. The station was
thronged and a cordon of policemen
was necessary to keep the crowds back
as the distinguished visitors made their
way from the train to the carriages in
waiting.
President McKinley walked with un
covered head from the train shed to
the stand and was cheered to the echo.
He acknowledged the ovation with
many smHei and bows. The party was
driven to the Hotel Walton and the
President immediately retired to his
private sitting room. At 10 o'clock
members of the United German Sing
ing Society, accompanied by a band,
arrived at the hotel and serenaded the
President. They sang three German
selections and finished with the "Star-
Spangled Banner," in which the multi
tude joined. During the rendition of
the songs, President McKinloy sat on
the window ledge, and, at the conclu
sion of each, led the applause. There.
were loud cries for a speech, but the
President merely bowed and waved his
white Fedora hat.
>: ar Admiral Sampson, who occupies
the suite of rooms directly over those
of the President, enjoyed the Berenade
equally as well as Mr. McKinley. It
was some time before the throng in the
str< â¢ t observed him, but when his pres
ence became known he was loudly
cheered.

about his feet.
GILROY, Sept. t -No npws has been
received from Sheriff Langfonl and party,
who are searching the Paeheeo Pasa
country for the bones supposed to be
those of Murderer James Dunham. The
Sheriff went by way of Los Banos, and
is prepared for several days' search. He
will go in on the old HolliÃter road and
work northward. Deputy John Reeves
did not so through Gilroy, and W. H.
Stfiyton did not accompany them on this
trip. ________Â»__ââ
NO ANXIETY OVER
THE MONONGAHELA
Overdue Training-Ship Not Believed
to Have Encountered Any
Mishap.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 4.â The Navy De
partment has not the slightest apprehen
sion as to the safety of the training ship
Monongahela, which is said to be overdue
at Annapolis. The Monongahela sailed
from Annapolis on the Ist of May on a
practice cruise across the Atlantic and
back, carrying about US) cadets from the
naval academy. She was bound for
Plymouth. England, where she arrived
July i. having taken two months in the
passage. She sailed on the homeward
trip July 8 and reported from Funchal,
Madeira, July 24. On July 27 she sailed di
rect for Annapolis, so up to this morning
she has been out thirty-eight days.
Officers of the Navigation Bureau say
this is by no means a long time to spend
in the voyage of 2SOO miles. The Naviga
tion Kureau officials argue that the Mo
nongahela must have been a thousand
miles east of the Indian hurricane which
recently prevailed.

The campaign for Commander in

fiercest contests the Grand Army of.
the Republic has been engaged in for a
| long time. To-night there are three
; candidates in the field â Acting Com
] mander in Chief W. C. Johnson of Cin
cinnati, Comrade Rassieur of St. Louis
and Colonel Albert D. Shaw of Water
town, N. T. A careful canvass among
the different departments indicates that
Colonel Shaw to-night has a little the
better of the contest. That gentleman,
in an interview to-night, said lie was
absolutely sur^ of victory, and said that
the fight was all over. Neither Colonel
Johnson nor Comrade Rassier would
speak directly about the contest, but
their lieutenants express the greatest
confidence Concerning the outcome of
the struggle. Each of the candidates
has a headquarters in full operation
and is distributing badges and hang
ing out banners.
While the delegations from Ohio. Mis

supremacy, the delegation from Illinois
is putting up a great fight for the priv

with a large yellow ribbon on which

THOUSANDS VISIT
THE STATE FAIR
Opening Night a Brilliant
Success.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PACRAMENTO, Sept. 4.â A great
crowd attended the opening of the
pavilion to-night, which Is In marked
contrast to the attendance on the open
ing night of a year ago. Over $1500 was.
taken in at the gates, against a much
lower amount in 189 S. Everything was
in readiness and all the exhibits were
in place, a circumstance unusual on
former occasions. It is predicted on all
sides that the pavilion end of the fair
will be a grand success, which is due
in a large measure to the enterprise
of the citizens of Sacramento. The
work of the Citizens' State Fair Com
mittee is apparent in all the features
connected with the annual State show,
special attractions having been pro
vided at their expense. The great ex
hibition hall was brilliantly illuminated
with thousands of incandescent lamps,
lighting up the entire interior of the
structure and the booths with pleasins
effect. The decorations were extremely
beautiful.
The fair was opened by an address
by the Governor In the pavilion, lie
was introduced to the first-nighters by
ex-Senator Frederick Cox, vice presi
dent of the State Agricultural Society,
in the absence of President Spreckels.
In his preliminary speech Senator Cox
said that the exhibits at the race track
and ihe pavilion could not be surpassed
by any other State in the Union. On
behalf of the society he thanked the
citizens of Sacramento for their work,
which will result in the complete suc
cess of the fair from every standpoint.
In his brief speech the Governor eu
logized the nation, the administration
and the State of California. The dis
play of Sacramento County, under the
control of the Grangers of the county,
was one of the finest ever placed in
the pavilion, consisting of an enormous
tomato vine equaling in size a young
tree. It is thirteen feet high and loaded
with fruit, some of which measured
five inches in diameter. Glass Jars
containing the finest specimens of fruit
and vegetables occupy prominent posi
tions in the exhibit. The wives and
daughters of the directors of the so
ciety will hold a reception to-morrow
night and visiting friends will be
served with refreshments.
On the evenings of the days set apart
for the various organizations the wives
of the members thereof will receive
their friends. The Odd Fellows will at
tend in large delegations on Thursday;
the Commercial Travelers on Friday,
and the Native Sons on Saturday.
These organizations and others which
have days set apart for them in the
second week of the fair have made
elaborate arrangements for their visits
to the pavilion.
The State Fair of 1899 will be an un
qualified success. Such is the opinion
of the most conservative of people now
in this city. .Â«;Â«_Â«.
There were sixty entries in the baby
show. The boys were designated by
blue ribbons and the girls by pink rib
bons. The following were the judges:
Miss L. Durgin, Oakland; Mrs. T. B.
Littlefield, Mrs. H. S. Farley, J. F.

DEAFNESS '
EAR DISEASES.
Frightful Afflictions Which Result From
Neglectâ All Affections of the Ear
Successfully Treated by Dr. Aborn,
554 Sutter Street, Who Has Had
Over Thirty Years' Experience as
an Eye, Ear, Head, Throat and
Lung Specialist.
â¢
Deafness la one of the most distressing
afflictions to which man is subject. The
loss of every other faculty except per-
haps that of sight may be endured with,
equanimity, but the loss of hearing is a
calamity for which there is no adequate
recompense.
The necessity for immediate treatment
of affections of the auditory tube, such
as inflammation, abscesses, ulceration,
feted discharges, polypus tumors, noises
and roarings, which result in deafness
when neglected, is perfectly apparent. To
neglect these symptoms is to invite
inevitable disaster.
These afflictions which lead to deafness
are primarily caused by the catarrhal af-
fections of the head and throat or the
breaking down of the nervous system and
when discovered should be immediately
looked after. They receive special at-
tention from Dr. A.born, 554 Sutter street,
who has. spent over thirty years in their
study and treatment. As a specialist in
the treatment of diseases of the, head,
eye, ear, nose, throat, lungs, digestive
organs and nervous system, he stands
unrivaled on the Pacific Coast.

was traveling down the mountain
toward the men faster than a horse can
trot. At first the men started down the
mountain, but the flames rushed
toward them and the smoke nearly
overcame them. They were confused
and did not know In which direction to
go. As the smoke became denser they
knew that they must lie down with
their faces close to the ground or be
stifled. There was a bare chance of the
fire burning over them without killing
them. They lay down to die, having
but little hope of escape in that awful
furnace.
Then suddenly the wind changed and
Allen looked up and saw a green spot
nearby through the lifting smoke.
"Come on b >ys, we're Isaved." he said,
and all rushed to the green spot, which
was a small creek of the Cuoamonga.
In this place the fire made but little
headway. The men had time while the
fire slackened a bit to make their way
to a rocky place, devoid of brush,
where they fell exhausted.
Their knees and shins were badly
bruised and skinned. Their coats, vests,
picks and shovels were lost. In spite
of this encounter Supervisor Border
says the men did not desert, but are
still fighting the fire. The Supervisor
will commend them highly to the Gov

OFFICIALS AT
NAPA SILENT
Will Not Explain the
Henneman Case.
Sp*claJ Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, Sept. 4.â The authorities of the
Napa Insane Asylum are either unable or
disinclined to explain the disagreeable
revelation made in the case of Mrs. Mary
Henneman, the unfortunate woman who
was found wandering aimlessly laFt Fri
day night and arrested In Oakland. The
woman is in a delica.te condition and at
tributed her misfurtune to some one con
â i in an official capacity with the
asylum. The asylum authorities Boout
the woman's charge as preposterous but
in doing co they admit that disgracefully
negligent conditions attend th* admission
of women to the asylum.
Dr. Dosier, who has charge of the fe
male ward of the insane asylum here,
says he knows nothing of the particulars
of the case of Mrs. 1-lennc-man. He can
throw no light that will prove the truth
or falsity of her accusation. It appeals
that the asylum authorities take no ade
quate precautions to learn the physical
dltion of women admitted ns patients.
The officers thus lay themselves open to
serious consequences, such as the pres
ent affair. The authorities of the asylum
also show very little care in ascertaining
the character of persons to whom dis
charged patients are given over upon
their release.
The present case is an example. On
May 13, is:*, Mrs. Mary Henneman was
received into the Nupn Insane Asylum
upon an order made by Judge Carroll
Cook of San Francisco. Tl>. complaint
was filed by the woman's husband who
Jeclared that th~ woman "began to show
signs of mental aberration about two
rears ago at the time when her younger
:hild was born; that she is dangerously
.iolent at times, threatening life mA
complaining that her husband â¢ had sold
he furniture of their home; that on sev
eral occasions she put on her husband's
clothes and wandered about the streets. "
A few weeks later her husband took an
ntirely different view of the situation
md of the condition of his wife. At his
nstance Mrs. Henneman was discharged
on June 11, 1899. The husband said he
wished to send his wife to her relatives
In the east. That the husband did not
keep his promise was demonstrated by
the arrest of his unfortunate wife in Oak
land.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 1899.
GERMANY'S BIG DEALS IN
FRENCH ARMY SECRETS
American Consul Alleged to Have Acted as
the Go-Between in the Purchase of
Information,
ATLANTA, Oa., Sept. 4.â The gen
tleman who claimed to know how
the French War Office secrets
reached Germany and the names
of those instrumental in their
transfer from France was seen to-day
by the Atlanta representative of the
Associated Press. All the matter given
in the Jewish sentiment story sent out
in these dispatches Thursday night was
gone over and substantiated as far as
possible, and much information tend
ing to amplify and elucidate state
ments made there was obtained. The
additional and highly interesting infor
mation was â¢ elicited that the letter
heads, envelopes and consular seals of
the United States Government were
used as a safeguard In transmitting the
French War Office documents from that
country to Germany, and also that one
of the chief actors in the "under
ground" system at the time the traffic
in French War Office merchandise was
going on held the position of United
States Vice Consul in a little German
city.
The informant gives his name as
Charles E. Benthelm, and his discharge
papers, which are regular and duly
signed, show that he was a private in
Company M, Two Hundred and Second
New York Volunteers, during the war
with Spain. He was, he says, not at
camp drill over ten minutes, but .was
put into the commissary department
and later transferred to the head
quarters division, where he became
brigade clerk. He accompanied the
Two Hundred and Second New York
to Cuba, and In addition to duty as
brigade clerk was called upon to per
form the duties of stenographer at the
court-martials held from time to time
at Pinar del Rio, where the New York
regiment was stationed. The paper
to the adjutant general's office in
Washington recommending his dis
charge is signed by William E. Horton,
assistant adjutant general, and came
from General William C.- Gates, bri
gade commander. The stamps of dif
ferent railway companies from which
he obtained half-rate transportation on
his discharge papers are plain. Ben
theim is an artist and this is the avoca
tion given in his discharge papers.
Since he left the service of the United
States he has been traveling over the
South and is at present on his way
from Montgomery to Washington,
where he says he will visit the sculptor
Trentanove. Bentheim. says he has no
interest In the matter and wished no
notoriety. His name was given only
at the last minute and under pressure.
His story was not told with that even
ness denoting rehearsal, and his" con
versation shows that he is fully ac
quainted with the cities of Germany
and the French capital. He says that
although he has known these things
for a long time, he has never made pub
lic the information of which he is pos
sessed. This Is the story:
I was born in Denver, Colo., and am 86
years of age. When quite young 1 was
sent to Paris to be educated. I went to
several countries on the Continent, pur
suing my studies, and finally to Germany
Here I "was employed about four years,
each day as a translator of documents
and map engraver by the Government,
and was in the headquarters of the gen
eral staff at Konipgratzerstrasse, Berlin.
During my service there I several times
translated papers bearing Information
concerning French fortifications, arsenals,
warships and land plans, and know all
those concerned in the purchase of this
information. The obtaining of intelligence
regarding the French army and navy was :
operated by the secret service department
of the Imperial Ministry of Marine. This
bureau was at one time under the control
of Prince Bismarck and Herr yon Moltke.
The Germans in Paris were always on
the alert for information. When a docu
ment was obtained from the office of the
Minister of Marine or the War Depart
ment in Paris It was taken to Prince
Helnrach Hans Pless. the German repre
sentative in Paris. Through him it went
to the house of one of his sweethearts,
where a copy was made. â¢ A few hours
later the original paper was returned to
the office whence it came.
The next move was to get these papers
to Berlin. Herr Franz, a toy manufac
turer at Sonneburg Germany, aided in
this. He would send dolls to Paris to be
dressed. In the body of these little play
things these copies of drawings and de
scriptions were securely sewed and started
on their journey to the Fatherland. From
Paris they were sent by post to Holmrook.
a village in England. Here another agent
was located, He was Herr L.indau, at
that time a partner in some mining opera
tions being carried on there. Lindau per
formed his duty by remailing the doll
messengers to Herr Franz at Sonneburg,
and once there they were safe. From
Sonneburg they were brought to the great
headquarters by Herr Franz. Once, I rec
ollect, a document of this nature was
brought In by the Burgomaster of Lelpslc.
whose name 1 cannot recall. Herr Alvin
Florschuetz, a bank director of Sonne
burg, was also in the scheme.
About this time, by thÂ«j way, Herr
Florschuetz was recommended by the
German Government as Consul for this
country at Sonneburg. He was accepted,
and. later on. being allowed for clerk
hire", put his wife, Lina, In that position,
giving her name on the reports as L.
Florschuetz. All the time that the traffic
in "War Office merchandise," as it was
known, was going on Herr Florschuetz
was Vice Consul of the United States.
"Was the doll plan the only one
adopted as a means of communication
between the two countries?" was asked.
Bentheim replied:
Oh, no. Several times I received docu
ments, of this kind in the regular United
States Consular envelopes. i remember
it distinctly. It was a large white en
velope with the usual "Official business
only and something about a penalty on
it and sealed on the back with a white
paper seal about the size of a half'dol
lar and had a serrated border on It. The
eagle was the center figure and above it
In a semicircle were the words "United
States Consulate." On the other half of
the circle and below the ea;jle was the
single word "Sonneburg." There was of
course considerable correspondence going
on between those few people regarding
the War Office traffic, and tins was
always done on the letterheads bearing
the one line inscription "United States
Consulate, Sonneburg." Nearly all the
descriptions of war vessels, new inven
tions, armor plate, underground mines,
fortifications, etc., were on letterheads
bearing the inscription "Ministre- de la
Marine. Paris," or "Ministre de la
Guerre, Paris."
Whenever Frigate Captain Sigl, who
was in charge of this work at Berlin,
went out on a scouting trip by himself
he carried a supply of United States sta
tionery, and I have seen Information of
this kind from the French War Office
come into the staff headquarters in an
envelope bearing the consular seal of the
United States Government. This, you will
know, was a safeguard, as nobody would
open a letter With this seal on it. Flor-
Echuetz, however, did more traveling
from Germany into France than either
Sigl or Franz, and he always had some
of this paper in his satchel: â¢ He would
not go into France direct, as that would
bring upon him too close scrutiny at the
frontier. He would go first to Bremen
and from there to Southampton. Here
he would board a steamer, either from
Cherbourg or Toulon, and land without
any trouble.
I will tell you how Florschuetz grot the
plans of the new submarine boat, Goubet,
while it was being. built at Toulon. This
Florschuetz told me himself at a theater
in Berlin a week or two after he returned
from the expedition, He landed at Tou-.
I lon and went to a hotel. Here he sent
a note to Mrne. Janssen, tolling her what
he wanted. lie then proceeded to Monte
Carlo for a day or two at the tables. It
I was arranged, of course, that if there
i was any trouble over the work word
; would be sent him. Mine. Janssen is the
; wife of a naval officer and had the
entree to the arsenal at Toulon. She se
cured all the information desired and it
was handed to Heir Florschuetz on his
return to Toulon in less than one week.
Information regarding the construction
of the war vessel Gymnote, at that time
building at Cherbourg, was obtained in
the same manner.
I will cite another case to show how
easily anything that Germany wanted
could be obtained. A sergeant in the
naval arsenal at Toulon, Thomas by
name, at the request of one of the five
or six women skirmishing around there
at the time, purloined a drawing which
gave clearly the inside of the fortress
with the location of the submarine mines
In the harbor. This information, I know,
went to Esterhazy, but it took a half
dozen women to get it to him. This
drawing was copied at tbÂ© home of one
of Prince Pleas' sweethearts in Paris and
the original drawing returned two days
later to Toulon. Thomas was found out
in this matter, however, and is now in
prison. The espionage system was such
that Germany was advised of the meet
ing of all boards connected with any
arsenal or fortification.
For instance, if a new gun were to be
tried, a German agent would be loitering
near the testing place ,and I remember
that on one occasion when an experiment
of this kind was concluded a rough
sketch of the result was handed the Ger
man agent before the officers left the
grounds. This was sent posthaste to
Germany. Often a report on the test of
a new invention would be in the hands
of the German Government before it
reached the Ministry of War in Paris.
This caused many laughs in the office at
staff headquarters.
During all this time I never heard of
Captain Dreyfus and did not know there
was such a* person until I heard of his
arrest.
Mr. Bentheim was asked who handled
the money for the maintenance of this
information bureau. His reply was:
Captain Sigl handled all money for this
merchandise, as they termed it, to Herr
Florschuetz. Emperor William did not,
of course, have any direct dealings with
those who did the work, but knew where
the men were sent. The money, as. 1 have
said, was paid from the secret service
fund of the Ministry of Marine, and I
can recollect now that $16,000, or Its equiv
alent in German money, passed into the
hands of Florschuetz and Frana, and
some money was paid them personally in
the War Office in Berlin. This money
wont into the hands Of the "workers"
through a postoffloe in . the American
quarter of Paris. Every six months re
mittances are made anonymously to the
Baroness de Delden through the Credit
Lyonnaise in Paris. The bank is entirely
Innocent of the purpose for which the
money is used, and the record will cor
roborate this statement. Baroness de
Delden was the sweetheart of Prince
Henry Pless, but later transferred her af
fections to Esterhazy. She is the "veiled
lady" of the Rennes court-martial.
Mr. Bentheim was, questioned as to
his reason for leaving Germany and
his reply was to the effect that a quar
rel with the Emperor over another mat
ter caused it. He was arrested and
place in the fortress at Potsdam; He
continued:
At that time I did not have my pass
ports on my person, but sent word to Mr.
Chapman Coleman, then secretary of the
Embassy at Berlin, who came quickly to
my assistance, and it being proved that
I was an American citizen, I was released
and soon after left the country. Mr. Cole
man will confirm what I have said.
Mr. Bentheim said he arrived in New
York from Berlin late in April, 1898.
There was plenty of war talk then and
he enlisted on August 5 of that year in
the Two Hundred and Second New
York Regiment. Continuing he said:
While at Camp Meade I was transferred
to the Quartermaster's Department and
later made brigade clerk. I was dis
charged at Washington Barracks January
27 of this year and received my money
the day following. I was the only man
of the Two Hundred and Second New
York discharged at Washington. At this
time the regiment was in Cuba, Brigadier
General Oates, in whose headquarters I
was clerk, recommended my muster out
at my request, and Adjutant General
Horton, who is now in the Commissary
Department of the War Office in Wash
ington, signed in Cuba the pass which
secured for me my honorable discharge.
The papers were finally signed by Colonel
F. L. Guenther, who was at that time
at Fort Myer.
â  Mr. Bentheim was told that the fact
that his story should appear at this
time with so much startling informa
tion would cause considerable doubt as
to its authenticity, and to this he re
plied:
I will go with you before a notary pub
lic and swear that everything I have told
you is the truth, or I will swear In a
similar way to any United States officer
or member of the German Embassy. The
story is absolutely true, and you are at
liberty to communicate with any of the
persons I have mentioned In an effort at
corroborating. Â»
DREYFUS DENOUNCED BY
AN AUSTRIAN REFUGEE
Fifth Week of the Court-Martlal at
Rennes Opens With, a Sen
sation.
RENNES, Sept. 4.â As the end of the
Dreyfus trial comes within sight the
French Government 1Â« beginning to display
fears that the verdict may give rise to
troubles, and orders have just been re
ceived by two regiments of Infantry and
one cavalry' regiment, already within hail
of Rennt*, to hold themselves in readiness
to march on the town at the first sign of
disorder, to occupy all strategic points
and repress all manifestations In thoir
Inception.
Local anti-Dreyfusard organizations, by
thoir anti-foreign articles, have already
singled out foreigners as enemies of the
country, and there is little doubt that
foreign journalists will be the first vic
tims of the violence of the mobâ not so
much Anglo-Saxons as Austrian, German
and Russian Jews, who form a majority
of the press representation of their re
spective countries.
To-day's session opened rathor badly for
Dreyfus, as a surprise was sprung upon
the defense in the advent of an Austrian
political refugee, Eugene- Cernuschi, who
came out with a flatfooted denunciation
of the accused, which, even though it may
eventually be proved a purÂ© fairy tale, is
bound for the moment to exercise a ma
lignant influence upon the French peoplo,
who have, not seen Cernuschi and are thus
unable to form a personal opinion of the
man who launched these direct accusa
tions against Captain Dreyfus.
Cernuschi's appearance la undeniably
against him. Tsobody even suspects that
he is what he claims to be. a scion of the
royal Servian house. On the contrary,
one would take him to be a groom dressed
in his best Sunday suit. It was remarked
that as soon as he had delivered his testi
mony and M. Labori had asked to have
him put on oath at to-morrow's session
behind closed doors, in order that he
might be punished if guilty of perjury, he
left the courtroom and was not seen
again.
Cernuschfs testimony, which was In the
form of a letter to the president of the
court-martial. Colonel Jouaust, was most
unequivocal. He claimed that on three
distinct occasions, twice in France and
once at Geneva, he was told by a high
piaced foreign officer that Dreyfus had
communicated treasonable documents to
a foreign power. In the third instance,
Cernuschi said, the officer showed him
documents emanating from Dreyfus and
that this officer left Franca hurriedly
two days prior to the arrest of Captain
Dreyfus. The allusion was evidently to
Colonel Schwarzkoppen, the military at
tache of the German embassy In Paris In
1*94 whose movements were coincident
with thofe described as the movements
uf the officer in Cernuschi's deposition.
Now. this evidence Is of transcendental
Importance to the prosecution, and it is
incredible, unless Cernuschi Is proved to
be a humbug-, that the Government com
missary, Major Carrlere, should have ad
mitted that he had received a letter from
him offering important testimony and
thrown It aside on the ground of Its com
ing from a political refugee. The depo
sition evoked expressions of incredulity.
One suspicious feature was the fact
that although the witness said he
could not speak French fluently
his letter to Colonel Jouaust asking
an opportunity to testify was drawn
up in perfect French. He explained that
he had been assisted by bia wife In writ
ing the letter.
This introduction of a foreigner as a
witness tor the prosecution gavo Mf La
bon an opportunity to submit the moat
important request, he has made through
out the trialâ a request which. If granted
by Colonel Jouaust, though this Is ex
tremely doubtful, certaimy would have
momentous consequences.
M. Labori announced his intention, in
view of the step taken by the prosecution
in calling foreign evidence, to ask that
inquiry should be made through the reg
ular diplomatic channels as t.> whether
the documents mentioned in the bordereau
wore actually communicated and, If bo,
by whom. This involves an application
to the German Government which the
court- mnrtial is scarcely likely to ap
piove. In any case the application meant*
the lengthening of the trial for several
weeks.
The introduction of Cernuschi and the
other developments of the day, it is gen
erally predicted, Imply another fortnight's
sitting at the least. Cernuschi will be
heard to-morrow behind closed doors. At
the same time there probably will be
an examination of the secret dossier, to
which Captain Cuignet referred this
morning and which M. Labori immediate
ly asked to have produced in court. This
dossier consists of twelve or thirteen doc
uments, and it is difficult to see why, if
they had any value, the etat major have
not had them produced earlier. The etat
major are not in the habit of holding
buck documents calculated to prove of
the slightest service to their cause, as
is shown in the case of the note concern
ing M. Hadamard's doubts of the inno
cence of his cousin, which was incorrect,
but was nevertheless included in .ac se
cret dossier, while the Important docu
ment stating, on the authority of the
French Minister to Rome, that an Italian
military attache paid Esterhazy 200,000
fnmes was studiously omitted from the
secret dossier. It is perfectly evident that
the Italian attache did not pay Esterhuzy
BUCh a sum on account of, as the French
say, his beautiful eyes, and the document
waa the best evidence that Esterhazy is
the traitor. Nevertheless the etat major
carefully kept this out of view.
M. Painleve, the distinguished mathe
matician, cornered General Gonse on the
hitter's falsified version of M. Hadamard's
remarks concerning Captain Dreyfus and
the manner in which Gonse squirmed and
his woe-begone appearance almost
aroused pity for him. General Roget also
appeared to begin to feel at last the
cruel strokes the etat major have been re
ceiving of late. He showed naught of his
cruel, brazi-n front to-day. On the con
trary his face was quite livid when he
left the stage after a very poor display,
and he quitted the courtroom as soon as
the proceedings were over, excusing him
self to his brother generals. Mercier and
Others of a higher grade, on the ground
of feeling ill.
The session ended with an exposure by
M. Hennion, chief of the Paris detectives,
of the disgraceful tactics of the etat ma
jor in suppressing his report in favor of
Captain Dreyfus and inserting a docu
ment more or less unfavorable to him.
Dreyfus began to-day, with the largest
attendance seen in the Lycee. The inter
est in the trial grows as the denouement
approaches. Six to ten days is given as
the. outside limit for the further duration
of the trial. There was an exceptionally
large number of ladies present to-day,
their bright costumes giving a gay look
to the courtroom.
The session opened very interestingly
with the appearance of the witness M.
Cernuschi. He was dressed in a brown
lounging suit. His features are unpre
possessing, and, in fact, his general ap
pearance did very little credit to the Ser
vian royal house, to which it is alleged
he belongs. His letter to Colonel Jouaust
offering h^s testimony stated that, hav
ing been mixed up in political troubles in
Austria-Hungary, he has been obliged to
seek refuge in France, where he had a
friend who was a high official of the For
eign Office of a central European power.
This friend, the witness said, told him
that certain foreign agents in France
might denounce him, the first name men
tioned being that of Dreyfus. Another
foreign officer, a foreign general of staff,
similarly warned him. One day the wit
ness said, when he was visiting the lat
ter, he saw him take from his pocket a
voluminous packet containing the mili
tary documents. The officer said that in
France one could buy anything, adding,
"What is the good of Jews If you don't
use them?"
Being asked If he ascertained the name
of the traitor in this case, M. Cernuschi
replied:
"No; because the officer had already
said Dreyfus was his informant."
This answer, and the tone in which it
was delivered, evoked a movement of in
credulity among the audience. Major
Carrlere, representing the Government,
asked the court to hold further examina
tion of this witness behind closed doors,
in view of the diplomatic side of his testi
mony.
M. Laborl then announced that since the
prosecution had summoned the aid of for
eign officers he intended to make applica
tion to have complete steps taken through
foreign channels to ascertain whether the
documents mentioned in the bordereau
were delivered to a foreign power, and if
so by whom. This announcement, if
Colonel Jouaust consents to the applica
tion, will have most important conse
quences. The words of M. Labori created
a deep Impression, as they made it evi
dent that counsel for the defense was on
the warpath to-day.
The second witness called to-day was
M. Andre, clerk to M. Bertullus, Judge of
the Court of Cassation, who received the
confession of the late Lieutenant Colonel
Henry. M. Andre deposed that he over
heard Lieutenant Colonel Henry exclaim:
"Don't insist, 1 beg of you. The honor
of the army must be saved before every
thing."
The next important witness was the
vÂ« U-known mathematician, M. Pamleve,
who began i>>- tearing M. Bertillon's sys
tem of argumentation to pieces. M. Pain
leve then entered upon a personal topic,
which quickly won him the close atten
tion of the audience and brought on a
dramatic scene, which kept the specta
tors in a state of excitement until he
finally left the bar. M. Painleve referred
to his evidence before the Court of Caa-
Batlon, and protested vehemently against
the version given by General Gonse of a
conversation with M. Hadamard, cousin
of Dreyfus, in which M. Ha. laniard ex
pressed" belief in the guilt of Dreyfus.
"Never," exclaimed the witness, "did
M. Hadamard doubt the innocence of nis
cousin."
General Gonse asked to be heard and
mounted the stage. After declaring that
the whole matter was insignificant. Gen
eral Gonse insinuated that the faith of
M. Hadamard and M. Painleve in the in
nocence of Dreyfus must have been
Btr< ngthened recently.
M. Painleve replied warmly, insisting
that he never had any doubt of Dreyfus'
innocence.
The two men then went at it hammer
and tongs. Painleve faced General Gonse
with his arm folded and thrust home his
questions and retorts until General Gonse
became red in the face.
Then General Roget joined in the dis
cussion.
M. Labori began a cross-examination
of General Gonse regarding a certain doc
ument in the secret dossier, to which
General Gonse had referred, but which
had not been submitted to the court.
M. Labori, not receiving satisfactory
JOHN Y. McKANE IS
REPORTED TO BE DYING
NEW YORK, Sept. 4.â John Y. McKane, formerly the political boss of
Coney Island and whose trial and conviction In 1894 for ballot box
Btuffing gave him national notoriety, Is dying at his home In Coney
Island of acute dyspepsia. Physicians who held a consultation to-day said
he would not survive the night.
At 2 o'clock this (Tuesday) morning Mr. McKane was unconscious and
sinking rapidly. It was not believed that he would live until daybreak.
I answers, and finding that Colonel Jou
| aust declined to allow him to press the
matter home in the way he wished, be
came extremely indignant and protested
with considerable warmth against Col
onel Jour-ist's veto of his questions.
This caused a little seem between Col
onel Jouaust and M. Labor!. Finally,
the latter asked why a certain dispatch
from the French Ehnbassador at Rome
relative to the payment of money to
Major Count Esterhazy by an Italian
agent had not been included in the secret
dossier presented to the court.
General Gonse replied that he had not
considered the dispatch of sufficient im
j portance to be included in the dossier.
I Colonel Jouaust here again refused to
allow some of M. Labori's questions. M.
Labori was fuming with indignation, but
| was obliged to submit.
M. Labori asked General Gonse who
compiled the secret dossier.
"I did," shouted Commandant Cuignet,
from the body of the hall.
Commandant Cuignet then came to the
bar and declared that he had omitted all
documents from abroad, "because for
eigners were interested in deceiving us."
Commandant Cuignet added that another
dispatch existed, relating to a conversa
tion between a foreign sovereign and a
French military attache, in the course
of which the sovereign said:
"What is now occurring in France is
proof of the powers of the Jews."
This dispatch, said Cuignet, although
against Dreyfus, was also omitted from
the secret dossier.
As he made this statement Command
ant Cuignet turned to a brother officer,
sitting in the place set apart for wit
nesses, and smiled with the self-satisfied
air of a man who had made a distinct
score.
MM. Demange and Labori immediately
arose and expressed surprise that fresh
evidence against Dreyfus should be in
troduced in this way. M. Labori also
i expressed curiosity respecting these doc- j
1 uments concerning espionage which were ;
being held back by the general staff and
he insisted that all these documents |
should be submitted to the court behind
closed doors. I
The question of the reports drawn up I
by Commandant Cuignet and Officer Kat- I
tines dealing exhaustively with the secret
dossier, was then introduced, and Gen- \
i era! Billot arose to explain that the state- ]
I ment was inexact that he 'took this re
port away with him.
"I gave' this report," he said, "to M. |
Cavaignac, the former Minister of War." I
"Then." said M. Labori, "let us have I
M. Cavaignac' S explanation of what be
came of the report."
Colonel Jouaust called for M. Cavaig
nac, but the former Minister of War was
not in the court-room and an officer was ]
sent to seek him.
Meanwhile the testimony of a couple ;
of minor witnesses was heard. The pro- \
ceedings described in the foregoing were :
exciting as at one time when General j
Chanoine and M. Paleologue were brought j
upon the stage to explain Commandant
Cuignet's statements there were five wit
nesses at the bar, all speaking at once,
and interrupting one another. The testi
mony throughout was interspersed with
heated scenes between M. Labori and
Colonel Jouaust.
M. Cavaignac could not be found In the
precincts of the Lycee, and it was de
cided to hear him to-morrow.
A commissary ,of the secret police
named Tomps was called by the defense.
His testimony concluded to-day's proceed
If you go to your tailor through friend-
ship, of course we can't expect to interest g
g$ you, but if you consider buying clothes a g

' ings. The commissary proved Indirectly a
strong witness for Dreyfus and a corre-
s pondingly damaging- witness for the gen
: eral staff. His evidence brought out a
glaring instance of duplicity on the part
â¢of the staff in suppressing documents
which must wi-aken its own case. Com
missary Tomps was called to the general
stuff office to investigate the espionage,
and naturally had consultations and close
relations with officers of the bureau.
Commissary Tomps began his testimony
by paying a high tribute to Lieutenant
Colonel Picquart's correct attitude and
uprightness in the Dreyfus inquiry, while
other officers sought to undermine him
by insinuations. Lieutenant Colonel
Henry, the witness asserted, tried to
induce him to attribute to Picquart the
communication of the bordereau to the
Matin, in which journal, it will be re
membered, the bordereau was first pub
lished. Then Commissary Tomps came
to the most important portion of his tes
timony, which led to a restricting of his
rev-elations. The witness was asked if
he had ever investigated the Paulmler af
fair, which was as follows:
Paulmier was the valet of Colonel
Schwarzkoppen, the German military at-
I tache at Paris, and it was alleged that
he saw on Schwarzkoppen's desk docu
ments signed by Dreyfus. The general
| staff had declared that an effort would
be made to get at the truth of this story,
but Paulmier disappeared, and therefore,
although the general staff could not prove
the story, it could not be disproved.
To the question regarding this case,
Commissary Tomps replied that he had
] not investigated the affair, whereupon M.
! Labor! suggested that M. Hennion, sub
chief of the political police, who is now
in Rennes superintending the precautions
for the safety of witnesses, may have
been intrusted with the inquiry Into this
case.
Colonel Jouaust called to Hennion, who
was present in the courtroom, "Come here
and testify."
M. Hennion ascended the platform and
took the oath. He declared that he did
investigate the case and actually found
Paulmier. who told him there was not
a word of truth in the whole story. He
had never seen any paper bearing the
name of Dreyfus.
M, Labor] at once called attention to
the fact that the general staff had sup
pressed M. Hennion's report in favor of
Dreyfus and only declared that the re
port had been received representing Paul
mier as untraceable.
Command.-int Cuignet and Captain
Junck then arose and insisted that only
the report that Paulmier could not be
traced had been received at the office of
the general staff.
M Hennion replied, reiterating that he
had forwarded a report to the general
staff, giving Paulmier s emphatic denial
of the whole story.
M Lahori asked Commandant Cuignet
and Captain Junck where the report was
that they said had been received by the
general staff stating that M. Paulmier
could not be found. The officers inter
rogated were obliged to admit that they
were unable to find the report. This prac
tically closed the matter.
The court adjourned after deciding to
sit with closed doors to-morrow to inves
tigate M. Cernuschi's testimony.

SACRAMENTO, S< pt 4.â Seldom has an
opening day at tin stale Fair Been such
a. crowd as p;iss> .1 through the turnstiles
at Agricultural Park this afternoon. It
wns not an Immense gathering:, but was

three seconds slow. Under the new mn:;-
GRAND STAND AT THE STATE FAIR TRACK.
The attendance at the opening of the Sacramento race mefttnp was the
largest of recent years. The grandstand and the inclosure fronting it were
crowded with spectat â 
sj.+ +.Â« Â» Â» Â» Â» <j> -â¦â - # â â â¦#â¢â¦â¦#â¦<
agement, the buildings and park were a
revelation to the "circuit-chaser." Every
thing wore a spick and span look and a
liberal application of the paint brush ad
ded greatly to the adornment of the
grandstand and betting ring.
In the judges' stand J. W. Wilson of
Sacramento presided, with General A. W.
Barrett and Joe Terry as associates.
Frank Covey of Palo Alto stock farm
acted as starting judge, and his splendid
send-offs were pleasant features of the
harness sport. "Dick" Havey sent the
running lields away nicely aligned, and
Galen Brown and F. Delong performed
the clocking.
The wants of the betting public were
attended to by four books,â a combination
book, an auction book and two pari
mutuel machines. The latter were in
Slight demand, the wagering being con
fined chiefly to the books. Phil Archi
bald, Paul Ridley, "Jim" Davis and Al
bert Feideler chalked up prices, which
were fairly liberal. "Pedigree" Brown
laid his Chinese hieroglyphics for the
"combo" fiends. . , -. ' , . â â â â 
The racing was clean and interesting
throughout, four favorites getting home
in front. Lena \V, Daedalion, Midlove,
Princess Zieka and Nilgar were the
money winners. â¢â â 'â -
Shortly before 2 o'clock the bell tapped
out the rive starters for the rich Occident
stake, worth $1825 to the winner, for
three-year-old trotters. Lena w, over
which William Hogoboom held the rib
bons, was the pick of the talent by ac
clamation, and the l-to-2 laid against her
before the first heat seemed a liberal
quotation. It proved "oil from the can,"
for the Lynmont won in three straight
heats without "raising a scrape," the
fastest mile being covered in 2:21^.. Of
the others. Dr. Prasse'a Sister, driven by
Charley Bunch, was. the only one en
d.'wed with any speed, falling in for sec
ond money without effort. . â  .V
Quite another tale was that of the 2:30
class pace, in which the winner was an
nounced only after a desperately con
tested six-heat struggle. On his impres
sive showing at the Santa Rosa meet,
Daedalion. with Hickey on the bike, was
Installed favorite, the books holding the
Diablo horse a I-10-2 chance. Sable Le-
Grande was quoteq at 4. Irvington Boy 4,
Cleon 6, Gaff Topsail 4, Marguerite 4 and
Alta 6.
For the first heat, Cleon drew the pole
position, losing it, however, before the
llrst turn was reached. The -first choice,
after making a scarcely perceptible
"Jimmy," led the way down the back
stretch, closely followed by Cleon and
Sable LeGrande. After passing the half,
the leader left his feet, ceasing to be a
contender. Sable LeGrande then took
command, winning the heat cleverly from
Cleon and Irvington Boy. Gaff Topsail
paced disappointingly, evidently not get
ting limbered up.
The poor showing made by the favorite
cut no figure with the pencilers, who
again marked him up a hot choice. With
a. Blight lead when the word was given in
the second heat, Gaff Topsail caught the
â¢wind first and was never headed, his fol
lowers getting 6 to 1 for their money.

-' Sable LeGrande finished second and
Irvington Boy third. Daedalion was again
very unsteady.
Still the books refused to f*iosen up
much against Daedalion. holding him at
, 6 to 5. with 8 to 5 against Topsail. When
Daedalion came out on the track it was

j replaced Hlckey on the bike. The change
worked a transformation, the ham
chestnut winning easily in 2.V.* from Sable
LeGrande. Topsail made a bad mess of
It on the backstretch, falling to the rear.
The heat following resulted in a fluel
between the favorite and Gaff Topsail, the
former getting the verdict by a half
length in a !'mish that brought the crowd
â  in the stand to its feet. Still, in the i â  >: r
trip the result was as much In doubt as
ever, Daedalion going into the air a six
th from the wire, ar.d Topsail, hard
held by Smith, jogging in.
Aff-r this all weni to the stable but the
heat winners. Topsail was a 3 to 5 chance,
evens were laid againsi Daedalion and 8
to 1 against Sab'.e LeGrande. After
rounding the tirst turn Topsail St( ppe I i n
a tack and the race was over, Daedalion
opening up a big gap and winning hands
down.
The second choice In the betting, the
strongly touted Princess Zieka, ridd< n by
i ".lack" Ward, placed th<^ Shatter s' ;; ; r:g
stake, at six furlongs, to her credit San
Tomas. with 99 pounds and Tommy Butler
1 in the saddle, was the pick of the talent,
I going to the post at 7 to 10. Sunello. the |
Slum entry, was away first and led the j
small field to the stretch, with the Prin
cess and San Tomas close up. Here the
latter had enough, and in a long, hard
drive Ward landed his mount winner by
over a length in 1:15%. Purmayah and
Mandamus were outclassed.
Midlove. ridden by Butler, made short
work of the big field in the six-furlong
scramble. An even money favorite, she
took the lead soon after the start, lead
ing out Mafada, a 20 to 1 shot . with
pounds to spare. Manzanilla ran third.
j On the strength of reported fast work-
I outs the old mare Monrovia, with Charley
Thorpe on her back, opened a 3 to 5 favor
ite for the final mile Belling run. Later a
play came in on Nilgai, sending him to
the post equal choice with Monrovia. At
the turn Thorpe on Monrovia was nearly
thrown and was never afterward danger
ous. Driving hard for over a furlong,
Ward on Nilgar reached the wire a half

2000 men have gone out.
Many meetings have been held In the

Hibbard. the club collector, placed It in |
the main hallway on a table next to the |
mailed man with the poleax. and allowed â¢
no member to vote who had not --aid up j
all his back dues. Money fairly rolled*
into the treasury. Three hundred and?
forty votes were cast during the after
noon and evening: and every mother's son j
was compel to dig down Into his cas- !
simeres before he could exercise the fran
chise.
- Even this feature of the election did not
deter voters, as during the first hour )
more than a hundred of them had paid j
down their coin and deposited their bal- !
lots. The late "boss." gam Ralney. was !
among the first, and from the familiar j
nod he pave Under Sheriff Martin It was I
surmised he bolted the regular ticket and
voted for Mallon. "Pop" Sullivan and j
Charlie Bacon dropped in, deposited their
ballots and dropped out. Colonel Brady
paÂ«sed swiftly through to the swimming
tank, gave one terrified look at more
water than he ever drank In his life and
fled back again to the street.
A few legal lights shone on the scene
about 3:30 o'clock. Henry E. Highton. j
who is an ardent Olympian, deposited his
ballot as gracefully a? the other athletes. !
Frank Kelly did likewise, lingering !
around afterward until the Under Sheriff
tried to pin a badge on his coat.

another friend of Mallon, catching Mar

I About 4 o'clock many anxious inquiries
were made concerning the whereabouts
of Jimmy Coffroth. a strong admirer 01
Mallon. He was nowhere to be seen, and
messengers were dispatched to scour
the town. At 4:30 he had not arrived, and
at 5 the Mallonites were in despair at his
absence. Suddenly through the main door
shot the figure of the missing man. The
white fleurs de Ms on the red band of his
straw hat were obscured by dust, there
was the red mud of Marln on his shoes
and the bottoms of his trousers were
rolied up for a deluge in dear old Lan
non. He was out of breath, but man
aged to explain between gasps that he
had been chasing "tibs" at Tiburon and
had missed the 1 o'clock boat by just a
minute.
He was forgiven and buckled down to
â w- rk with a will. The drooping spirits
of the Mallor.ites took new courage, and
the bat:'.-- waxed fierce and closer than
ever. Voting fell off before dinner, but
after that Important function, at which
the workers did not participate, it m
sed apace. At a few minutes to 9
o'clock, the hour set for closing the polls,
was a fair sized crowd in line for
the ballot box, the approach of others up
the street being heralded by pickets out
side. SI Green had a tough run up hill
to make it, but he did. Bert Nason tried,
but failed, the judges dropping the dis
tance flag on him just as he entered the
door.
The secrecy nf the ballot had been so
â¢ y maintained that no one made any
pretensions as the polls closed to knowl
edge of the way things had gone. All
agreed that it would be a close thing.
The inspectors soon settled the question.
At 9:3f> o'< lock they announced that 340
tfl had been cast. 19S for the regular
ticket. 131 for the members" ticket, on
which appeared the name of Mallon. and
11 not counted by reason of lack of mark
ing.
The announcement of the result was
plainly pleasing to the Hapsellites, and
â¢ ken with as good grace as possible
by the friends of Mallon. who took some
â¢ in calling attention to the vote
polled by their candidate, handicapped as
he had been.

SHAMROCK ON
A TRIAL SPIN
OFF NEW YORK
Tests Her Speed in
American Waters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 4.â The Shamrock
spread her wings for her first practice
ir. American waters to-day and every one
who saw her move said she was very fast,
It was about 11 o'clock when the trial
was started and between 3 and 4 when it
was over. Sir Thomas L,ipton, Mr. Fife,
the designer of the Shamrock, and Mr.
Ratsey were aboard the Shamrock. Cap
tain Archie Hogarth and his assistant.
Captain Bob Wringe. steered the yacht
alternately. She sailed over the regular
cup course, starting from the Scotland
lightship, making; for the Long Island
shore, then back to the New Jersey 'â¢hore
and then back to the starting point.
Aside from the Shamrock and her escorts
there were no boats down there except
the press boats.
After the trial the Shamrock with her
tender anchored in the H< raeshoe, where
they will remain until after the races are
v,r. The Erin, with Sir Thomas Lipton
aboard, will probably stay at Sandy Hook
until "W ednesday, when she will bring her
owner to Tompkinsville. There will be
another trial to-mcrrow with the Sham
rock carrying the same spars but another
Bel : sails.
The only unusual incident of the ir.p
was the passing of the Shamrock and tne
ocean liner City of Rome, which was in
coming. This occurred when the Sham
rock had started on her trial and was
about four ml'.es off Sandy Hook. The
steamship saluted the Shamrock with her
siren whistle and dipped" her colors. The
passengers were all crowded to the side
and gave the Shamrock a hearty cheer.
NEWPORT. R. 1., Sept. 4.â ln to-day's
race, the second and last of the official
trial races for the settlement of a de
fender of the America's cup. the Colum
bia again demonstrated that she is the
superior of the Defender, the I^^s cham
by defeating her ten minutes and
â  Beconda over a triangular coarse in
an eight-knot breeze and a smooth sea.
The contest was a procession throughout,
wit] â¢ â  â¢ Columbia leading at the start by
one and a half seconds and gaining on
every leg of the course.
The first leg was a reach from the start
ing line at Brentons Reef lightship, south
east one-half, east to a flag mark, a dis
tance of ten miles, and from the moment
the Columbia crossed the line she stead-
Qy sailed away from her rival, gybing
around the first mark three minutes and
thirty-six seconds ahead.
The second leg was also a reach, a lit
tle broader than the first, but even if the
Defender did not set her spinnaker a mile
from the turn she dropped two mil
and nineteen seconds more in the rur.
to the second mark.
The third leg of the triangle was almost
a dead beat to the finish, the two
making a long hitch clear up to the Nar
ragansett shore. The Columbia made
two other short tacks before she reached
the line, but the Defender, by holding
longer in-shore. managed to reach the
lightship without another tack. Still the
Columbia gained, showing that with
sheets close hauled she is the fastest
American sailing yacht afloat. On this
East leg she added four minutes and
twenty-two seconds to her lead, making
a total for the entire course of ten min
utes and seven seconds.
There will be no more official races,
that of to-day settling conclusively in the
minds of the committee which of the two
boats is better fitted to meet the Sham
rock.
The cup committee is permitted to de
fer naming the cup defender until a week
prior to the date of the first cont-st. and
therefore the decision was not made pub
lic. Of course there Is not the slightest
doubt that the Columbia will be the craft
chosen.
What all the yachtsmen would like to
see Is a contest between the boats when
they could carry only their lower sails.
On the run of the New York Yacht Club
from this point to Vineyard Haven
during the recent cruise, in a half gale
the Defender practically defeated -he Co
lumbia on time allowance, and there are
to-day many who think that the old boat
is the faster in a stiff breeze. On the
run to the Vineyard the Columbia had a
pine mast, which no doubt handicapped
her to some extent, and what remains to
be seen Is whether she Is improved in
heavy weather by the steel mast as much
as she is In moderate breezes.
The Columbia's mainsail fitted a little
better to-day than it did on Saturday, due
no doubt to the stretching it received ia
the first trial race aaid the subsequent
hauling out on the boom and gaff. Still,
there is an opportunity for much improve
ment, as there is a curl to the leach that
some of the yachtsmen do not like.
There will be a race to-morrow morning
between the Columbia and the Defender
for a cup offered by William Goddard of
Providence, Mr. Iselln's father-in-law.
The reason for holding this race is to try
a new and lighter weight mainsail on the
Columbia.
The official summary of to-day's race
follows:
Startâ Columbia. U:X4f; Defender, l: 26:22.
Finishâ Columbia. 2:43:33; Defender, 2:53:53.
Elapsed time â Columbia, 3:1T:24; Defer.der,
S:?T:31.
So the Columbia won by 10 minute* 7
seconds, actual time, in a race of close to
thirty-three miles, for about three miles
must be added for the windward work
sailed in the last leg of the course. There
fore the Columbia averaged ten mile* an
hour for the entire distance.

A CENTER OF EXPRESSION.
OAKLAND has long been Known as me
Athens of the Pacific." Its Attic reputation
was not derived from the salt work? on the
hay beach, but from the number and excellence of
its schools. The State University, though located in
Berkeley, between the bay and Grizzly Peak, has been
claimed as really a suburban institution of Oakland,
and from that down to the ward school in which Pro
ftssor Markham writes the "Man With a Hoe"' ani
is the actual man with a rawhide who inculcates in
tellectual gunnery among the young, these schools
have enjoyed a reputation which justifies the nick
name.
That their work has not been in vain, nor the
Greek reputation of the city unjustified, is being
proved daily. Oakland has become the center of ex
pression. There have been extracted possibilities not
supposed to have existed in the English language.
No reference is made to the guild of Grecian orators
who have long spangled the air with figures of speech
so decorative that birds are charmed to the glowing
scene of their performance and bees gather honey
from the atmosphere sweetened by eloquence. There
is developed in Oakland another besides this high an
which converts speech into perfumery.
The city officers, chosen by the people, who live
and move and have their being according to the
scholastic canons, who increase in a geometrical ratio
and decrease, die and pass hence after the philosophic
rules set by Socrates, in their public exits and en
trances and their official forms of speech have re
newed the best traditions of the peripatetic school
and talk not only like books but like new books, as
new as those of the Elizabethan age were in their
time.
Recently the Assessor of this center of expression
was summoned to Sacramento to justify his official
judgment of valuations. The experienced tormentors
who compose the State Board of Equalization put
him on the rack and proceeded to extract perspira
tion from him by way of answer to their quiz. Pro
ceeding from one extreme of official curiosity to
another, they finally reached the limit of Attic en
durance, and the Assessor explained that the only
answer flowed from his pores, because "no live, liv
ing man could answer that question."
Put this beside St. Paul's "most straitest sect," and
Shakespeare's "most unkindest cut of all," and "Oh.
that this too. too solid flesh would melt," and it look
level into them all. Its antithesis, "no dead, dead
man," rises in immediate strength and fully equipped
for use.
The Assessor is not the only fountain and source of
expression. The Mayor of Oakland not long since,
desiring to avoid some asperity of feeling aroused in
the Auditor's office by a criticism of its chief, wrote
and published a letter in which the criticism of the
chief was admitted, but the admission was hand in
hand with the solemn declaration that the Mayor did
not have the Auditor in mind when he criticized him!
That alone was delicious, but after all it was merely
the honeycomb which contained the mayoral sweets
of expression, for he added. "In fact. 1 believe I may
say that I have almost said, perhaps mote than once,
that you were the best equipped man ever elected
Auditor."
Surely there is an expression that may go down in
the Auditor's family as an heirloom It i- an ex
pression that can no more be painted than the lily
nor gilded than refined gold.
Oakland. Felix! Happy Athens of the Pacific,
where such expression has become as natural to the
people as their songs to birds.
The .story of Adam and Eve and the fruit was re
versed the other day at Taunton, Mass., with disas
trous results. A young woman ate an apple given her
by her sweetheart. Ten minutes later she became
speechless and has so remained. What an ideal
mother-in-law she will make some day.
Two San Quentin convicts, insane as well as crim
inal, have resorted to the Kncipp cure. There is a
water cure, sometimes administered in the dungeon,
that might prove efficacious in modifying the perver
sity of the penitentiary enthusiasts.
HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT.
THE public topic of greatest interest now is the
I ; >rm of government to be provided
for the tropical iucurabrances which have re
cently fallen into our possess]
The ( - tateraents made by all classes of lead
in Hawaii, whic 'â¢ in The Call last
..re a vhid revelal I the cond:

isidei tions the prefer

The whole law iras finally repealed and

labor under ntract The civil lien in the
as 1 ilogue of the penai clause in the
â  :an contracl h â  s th< mean? of enforcing
the contract.
A- t :hc futui rin Hawaii, the interviews
present the issue in a form that will be found oi great
-:. Inasmuch as the United State-, and es
. the Atlantic seaboard States and interior, get
their labor from Europe '' mi igi ti n, it is held
! get theirs from Asia. For its
immediate source Japan and the Philippines are pre
ferred. This ] sition has decided strength derived
n the current cult that as our Atlantic coast face?
Europe and has there its trade and thence derives it?
I labor. Â«o the Pacific Coast, facing
od expecting its trade from there, should
thence derive its labor. This view is applied to the
Pacific islands, whose people declare that they have
no other source from which to recruit the only form
of labor that can be used in their industries. It is
natural and reasonable that such, expectations shall
go with the expansion and commercial policies now
â  in the minds of men on this side of the
â 
The opinion is generally expressed on the island-.
and it is not by any contradicted, that white men can
not work in the leading industries, of Hawaii on ac
q climate. The productions of the islands
are tropical, and the labor that produces them must
â¢:'.i::ie to the climate in which they flourish.
The interviews betray a feeling of unrest at the
ious form of government now in existence.
soi . mplaints are made against the per
of that government 1 me demands are
made that r. fits members be recognize'
of the government to come.
The Call has now spread this information of the
opinions and aspirations of Hawaii before the Ameri
can public. Already it seems to have impressed the
President, who is reported to have declared for the
Territorial form t nt. Public opinion,
guided by this inform. be crystallized against
the time of action by Congi
Objections to putting the islands in line tor state
hood will arise in the fact that it will become a prece
dent for the Philippine-. Already the President
speaks of a Philippine government for "their period
of transition." While it is true that every argument
made for statehood to Hawaii will apply to the Phil
ippines, it is also true that there is widespread aver
sion to .-tatehood for the Philippines and citizenship
for the Filipino?. It will be regarded as an attempt
to put the whole expansion policy in line with our
constitul h contemplates no other extensi m
of our area except by the admission of new States
into the Union. The population of the greater part of
the Philippines, especially on Luzon. Panay, Xegros
Â«nd Cebu. is as well qualified, by civilization, citizen
ship. Christianity and education, for the duties of
statehood as that of Hawaii. This is not intended for
a certificate to the fitness of either. But the prin
ciple of civil equality throughout our jurisdiction is
believed to be the only one that can perpetuate the
republic.
The Briti c h colonial system, which has been studied
by our statesmen for application to our torrid posses
sions, is in accord with the British constitution, but
Hot with ours, and it is probable that the demand will
increase for a preference for our own institutions
rather than for those of Great Britain. In its final
analysis this will mean that we are to hold no terri
tory that cannot be adapted to our system and receive
pie that cannot, by reason of race, assimilate
with us. This is the crux of the whole issue. At the
root of it He the differences in physical conditions.
â  germinate the industrial problems which
penetrate the whole subject. If our labor laws, con
wages and regulations, extended to the
tropic-, make profitable production there impossible,
ions in the torrid zone will bring us no profit.
This. a<= we have heretofore shown, is the growing
shadow upon tropical ownership by Great Britain.
The most profitable labor system in the tropics is
slavery, the next is servile labor under penal
contracts, the last is free labor, under the eight hour
law and the American scale of wages. Great Britain
chattel slavery, but promotes servile labor un
der penal form";.
We have no doubt that if our labor laws and system
and wages are extended to Hawaii production will be
curtailed and its profits will cease, and the prosperity
of the islands will follow the same downward course
that has made of Jamaica an industrial wilderness.
There is, then, an irrepressible conflict between the
principles of our constitution and the interests of
those whose profits depend upon a labor system
suited to the torrid zone.
The revolution in San Domingo having ended in
hi*, favor, General Jimenes can leave his Cuban seclu
sion and accept the Presidency with all the satisfac
tion of a man who gets office without having had to
do any of the fighting for it.
THE CASE OF CAPTAIN CARTER
IZ^RANK P. BLAIR, attorney for Captain O. M.
Carter, convicted by court-martial of a scries of
grave offenses, among which was the robbery
of the Government of sums aggregating $1,720,000. has
made a statement to the press contradicting certain
reports concerning an affidavit filed with the Presi
dent, in the course of which he denies he ever
charged General Otis .vith subornation of perjury.
He assert! his affidavit goes no further than to show
prejudice on the part of the general. He then make?
tlii- strong statement: "I believe Captain Carter is
the victim of a conspiracy to degrade him. It is nn
An crican parallel to the Dreyfus case. The same gen
eral features are in both cases. The accusers and
l>rt secutors of Carter are of the general staff of the
army, as are those of Dreyfus. Jealousy and a de
liberate attempt to carry out the wishes of superiors,
1,0 pander to political influence, has actuated the ma-.
jority of men on the Carter court-martial."
By way of explaining why there should be a con
spiracy against Carter, Mr. Blair says: "Carter was
THE SAX FKANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, ISO 9.
Ed as a member of the Nicaragua Canal Commis
sion to investigate the exact conditions of the scheme.
He was selected because of his known engineering
ability. At the Ajrmy and Navy Club at Washington
he said he proposed to get at the bottom of the
schen c and show it up. He was then sent to Eng
land as military attache of the American Embassy.
On his return he was placed under arrest charged
with rauding the Government I believe that if he
had never announced his intention to prick the plans
promoters he would not have been accused."
The statements are sufficiently sensational to be in
teresting Of course allowance will be made for the
they are si I ts ol - : -. v lor l ' le
[ense. Nevertheless they promise to give rise to n
developments in the case. The conviction of Carter
was pronounced nearly a year and a half ago. The
court had been in session for four months and had
made investigations covering Carter's transactions in
connection with harbor improvements for nearly
rteen years, and it was after careful deliberation
upon the evidence the verdict of guilty was pro
nounced.
The public will be slow to believe there was any

the judgment of the court. For that reason there has
been a widespread belief he has a strong backing

peared to be a conspiracy on his sine, and the allega
tion of a conspiracy against him adds to the interest
of the case. Certainly there is something extraordin
ary in thp situation. If Carter be guilty, why is he
not punished. If he be not guilty, why is he not
tted? Under the circumstances a revision of the
in an open trial would not be displeasing to the
public.

EUROPEAN SUBSIDIES FOR SHIPPING. '
\A R. CHAMBERLAIN, United States Com
/ \ missioner of Navigation, direct? public at
* *â  teni â â  more to the advantage given the
commercial marine of European nations by the lib
i cral subsidies granted them, ostensibly for carrying
! mail, but really for the purpose of enabling them to
extend the trade of their various countries. The
] theme is an old one and every argument relating to
it h; - gone over time and again, but until our
Government ha- been impelled to profit by the les
son it teaches it can never be repeated too often.
According to Mr. Chamberlain the most important
nil!' postal â  â¢ at this time are those of Great
Britain. Germany. France, Italy and Austria-Hungary
for mail service to the eastern coast of Asia, China,
Japan. Cochin-China, etc. These five nations spend
annually $4,500,000 for their mail lines to the east
coast of Asia. The United States, it maj be added,
for it.- Asiatic mails in 1897 paid Sj^.ooo to American
steamships and $14,000 to I tships.
That this sum expended annually in the name of
i postal contracts is noi designed for the purpose of
advancing mail facilities so much as for that of pro
moting commerce is made clear by Mr. Chamberlain's
demonstration that if rapid mail service were desiri i
'. it could be better obtained by promoting steamship
i lines to and from Amir pori the route aci
this continent is the quickest by which mail between
Europe and China can be carried. On that point ne.
says: "The establishment of a fortnightly American
service from San Francisco to Shanghai will bi
Berlin and Paris, not to mention British pom.
within twenty-eight or twenty-nine days of Shanghai,
and under favorable but not extraordinary conditions
; within twenty-seven days, while the best Briti-h
achievement and best German promise by subsidized
routes is now thirty-two days, and the average is
thirty-three or thirty-four.''
As a matter of fact the pretense that subsidies
granted to shipping arc designed lor mail facilities is
no longer kept up by any nation except Great Brit
ainn, and even there it deceives nobody. As the Coni
: missioner says: "The Peninsular and Oriental, North
German Lloyd, Messageries Maritimes, . Societa
Navigazione Italians and Lloyd Austriaco companies
are now backed up liberally by their respective Gov
ernments as a means of promoting trade, and es
| pecially export trade, in manufactured goods of Great
! Britain, Germany. France. Italy and Austria-Hun
gary with China and Japan. There is no effort at
concealing this fact in the reports of the companies
every year, and there is nothing discreditable about
it to conceal."
The nation whose ships can most cheaply carry
abroad the goods which foreign markets demand will
obtain the trade of those markets. The industries of
that nation will consequently be profitable. and flour
ishing, while those of othe^ nations lag for lack of
ability to >ell their products. At one time Great
Britain, by having almost a monopoly of the carry
ing trade of the ocean, became something like the
industrial center of the world and did an enormous
percentage of its manufacturing. By sagacious sys
tems of protection other nations built up manufac
turing industries of their own. which in time produced
an output greater than the local demand called for.
Then the French and the Germans began by subsi
dized ships to promote their foreign trade, with the
result that Groat Britain now finds them active com
petitors in all part.- of tin- world. '
The United States have reached a point where for
eign trade is necessary for the extension of their vig
orous industries. An American merchant marine
paying the high wages of American labor in ship
yards and on shipboard cannot compete against the
subsidized ships of other nations. It is time, there
fore, for our GoverniMol to learn the lesson the ex
perience of other countries has taught. With a lib
! eral policy of governmental aid to American shipping
industries there would be no need to undertake wa - s
and conquests for the sake of commercial expansion.

THE STUDENT VOLUNTEER.
By IDarvid Starr Jordan.
A Stanford boy not long ago in Germany walked
through a Franconian forest and found by the wayside a
{ young man a soldier in his first uniform, lying with a
broken head. Hehelped carry the boy to his peasant
home, and when his mother saw him bloody and insensible,
but alive, she thanked God that he was saved from the
army.
Better a broken cripple than a soldier against his will,
and on unwilling service rests the military glory of the
great powers of Bun ;â â¢â .
In the history of man, two Ideas have always barred
his progress. These are, first, that the individual man be
longs body and soul and prop* rty to the State, and second,
' that the State is the man or men who happen to be at
the head of affairs
"The State," said Louis XIV. "the Stateâ that is I, the
King"; and at another time he wnrte: "The King does
| what he will"; and so, as the King is the State, the men
bekmgs body and soul and property to the King.
It was to protest against all this that the citizen sol
fiier arose; the soldier who wore his own clothes, not the
livery of any King.
The citizen soldier through the ages is the man who
fights wrong with eyes open. When the wrong is made
right, he goes home to his work, a soldier no longer, but
a man, and it is his greatest heroism that he comes back
a man unchanged by all that happens to him.
The citizen solder is as old as the struggle for freedom.
It is only such that have made war an instrument to
human progress. Oliver Cromwell was a citizen soldier
and Miles Standish and George Washington. The embat
tled farmers of Lexington, who "fired a shot that was
heard an-und the world," were citizen soldiers.
They stood for the right of manhood to manage its
own affairs, they turned their muskets against the i<i>-a
that the State owned them body and soul and property.
Tiny declared that George 111, his Cabinet and Parlia
ment, in whom they had no- part, nor lot, nor representa
tion, was not their State.
Cromwell's word on the statute book of Parliament
might have been their Declaration of Independence. "All
just powers, under God, are derived from the consent ot
the people."
The citizen soldier would not consent to injustice, and j
a !. fired that shot at Lexington.
It was the citizen soldier who died at Bunker Hill, who
starved and froze at Valley Furge, whose way was I
blocked at Stillwater, Long Island and the Brandywine,
but whose resolute persistence turned defeat into victory.
It was the citizen soldier who swelled the guerrilla bands I
of Marion and Sumter, who fell at Quebec and conquered
at Yorktown.
In like fashion, the citizen soldier an.-se again in 1861. '
In the South, at the call of his State, the State that be- I
longed to him; in thr. North, at the call of his Nation, the
Nation he had made. Not that Nation or State had owned
him and forced him forth from farm or shop. It was his'
State, and he swore that her soil should not be invaded.
It was his Nation, and he swore that her integrity "must
and shall be preserved." So Ninth and South alike it was
the citizen soldier, at Gettysburg and Shiloh, at Malvern I
Hill and the Wilderness, from the Potomac to the Chatta
hoochee, from the Brazos to the Cumberland.
Citizen soldiers were they all and when they came back
from Appomattox Courthouse, one and all, a'l that were
;â  â¢ them went home to the plow, to the forge, the !
teacher's desk and the counting-house, to whatever place j
was left to them.
In the fighting South it was just the same as in the
North. When the cause was lost and its banner furled the I
men came home, the gray ghosts of all that had been
fairest and strongest in the South, and each took finally j
the place the Fates held '.penâ the place of citizens of the i
United states.
And ill" losl f State's rights merged into the I
greater cause of hu i I lorn.
There were noi many i ollege students in IT7H. but those
few madt the infant republic. The constitution was the
woik of the men of Harvard and Yale, of Columbia and â 
William and Mary. Since those days we have become a
nation of Btudents. What< ver â¢ Ise America has done, she
is naming her young men and women. Her college men
aie the : :st "fall her citizens. Whatever else our uni
versities may be they are not asleep. They are keenly
awake to all thai takes place in the world around them.

Not alone from Harvard, but from every college Nort]
or South went forth the student soldier.
In every battle of the great war the college studer.
stood in the front on either side, and he fought as n
soldier ever fought before the battle of convinced right
eousness?. On the one side "a missile steeped ir. hate"; oi
the other a defender "of the poor and oppressed and wh
j are just as good as I or you and as precious in the sigh
i of God."
The college soldier is at once the best and the wnrs
| of all fighters. He is an intelligent unit of war, not .
j shooting machine. The great warriors of the past, th<
i Caesars and Napoleons, would have had no use for him
To them a man was a mere implement; no more '
of self-direction than the cartridge and of no more us
when exploded.
What, though the soldier knew
Some one had blundered;
Theirs not to reason why.
Theirs not to make reply.
This cheapening verse was n<n written of college m*n
When they know "some one has blundered" it is for thei
to help correct it. At the worst they must reason why
j have their own .'pinion r,f blunders and blunderers.
! other wurds they have heart and brains as part of th- -
i equipment If heart nnd brains are demanded. From th* r i
rank? rise war's football heroes, the Funstons and I:
'< volts, the men who can speak as well as fight and t
1 whom the people cannot choose but listen.
But folly and lncompetency, cowardice and pretend
find no rritics so severe as these same football heroes. The
wrong kind of captain dreads the college man, and th>
right kind, of course, delights in him.
The war for Cuban freedom touched the heart of th'
college man. In every company the university was repre
sented at Manila. There were perhaps lf.O from the col
leges of this coast. Sixty from Stanford, at any rate, be-
B the few who went from there to Santiago and an
other few who were stalled in thf- swamps of Tampa.

All is well with America so long as the citizen soldier
alone can fight her battles. No honest nation ever had,
none needs and none can ever rightly use a mercenary
army. When America shall make war professional her
glory has departed, for a great army and a great n
never did and never can exist together. There can be i o
"government of the people by the people and for th
pie" when "the red-coat bully in his boots" shall "hide the
march of men" from us.
But the soldier of the republic has never yet been the
"bully in his boots," of whom Thackeray wrote. Hia
movement is part of the march of men itself.
One word more. The citizen soldier costs the nation
as no other soldier does. The citizen is part of society,
with the dependence of love and helpfulness. When he
falls on the field ot battle he does not die alone. The
bullet speeds to his home, to his wife, his sweetheart, hi 9
mother, his children. The soldier of fortune has no in
cumbrances. Nobody owns him. He owns nobody. He
lives and dies for himself. The soldier of the republic d!"s
twice and more than twice â in his home, in his hopes, in
the hopes of others.
And this is not all: only the beginning. The Htiz-n
soldier is the best of citizens. It is from his loins that the
better citizenship of the future should come. When he
dies before his time the stock of manhood is lowered. It
is the fighting nation that becomes the nation of cowards
when the fighting men are dead. 'Send forth the best
ye breed." This is Kipling's cynical advice, and when
we follow It we breed second-class men only. It was gl ri
ous war that undid Greece and Rome, that has wasted
France and Spain.
For the bravest century after century have fallen and
the coward the army could not use becomes the faiK
the family. To this day we mourn the heroes of the war
of the rebellionâ North and South, East and West, in each
family is at least one vacant chair.
But the nation merits more than all thie. Not alone
the million who fell to expiate our debt, th- negro's
and rights we stole, "for every dr*>p of blood drawn by
the lash another drawn by the sword." but more than
these â the millions who should have been and ar- not ThÂ»
sons and dauehters of our fallen broth-rs mid bt- with
us to-day. The nation needs their strength, freedom needs
their voices, we need their sympathy; we stretch forth
our hands toward them and behold they are not; they
have never been and they shall never be. Of all the curses
of Mack war â and all war is black, whatever Its necessity â
this is the deepest on the nations. The h*--ro fall? and
with him the issue of the heroism. When nations throw
away men's lives for glory, for conquest or for commer
cial supremacy, these are the wounds that time fan I
heal. And so it may be the Fram-onian peasant mother
is wiser than she knows when she says "Think God. my
son is saved from the army." We may imagine that the
guardian spirit of Germania. stern Amazon that she is.

CHICAGO. Sept. 4.â ln the presence
of Chief of Police Kipley and Inspector
Shc-a and before a notary public. Her
man Hur.dhausen, who with Richard
Koenick was arrested late Saturday
night, charged with the murder of
Hichard Koeller. their former school
mate, made a full confession of the
crime to-day.
Revenue and not Jealousy of a wo
man, according to Hundhausen. was
the motive and the stabbing was done
by Hoenick with the knife found by the
police in his grip. Several years aso
a series of incendiary nres* had oc
curred in Herman, Mo., and other
neighboring towns and Hur.dh.-tusen
and Hoenick were arrested and put on
trial. Koeller, it is said, testified at the
time to the effect that the two were
implicated and largely on his testimony
convictions were secured. They swore
to have revenge on Kneller. The mur
der was planned some time ago. It
"was the idea of the two to make their
way to Baltimore via Cincinnati after
the commission of the crlmo and thence
take passage to Europe on a cattle
steamer.
Confronted by the confession given
by his companion Hoenick broke down
and admitted the truth of Hun-i
--hausen's confession under the inter

Shea, "I have for ten years intended
to avenge my brother, who was as
sassinated in Hern Mo.,"' said Hoe

After the confessions of both â Hoe
nick, who is 20. and Hundhausen. who

AT Eunset last evening "Rosh Hashonah," the Jewish New Year, was .
ushered in throughout th* 1 land with solemn prayers and beautiful
music. In this city the temples and synagogues were crowded with
devout worshipers who poured out their blessings to God for the :
kindnesses received during the past twelve months and renewed
their prayers for a continuance of hi? beneficence.
According to the Jewish calendar, it is the year 5860 of the creation, or
more properly speaking, the era of man. The services at the various |

.HOPES FOR DREYFUS
Brrj HE Jewish New Year Is generally the
I beginning of a season in which the re
l:g:ous Jew reviews his past arid en
deavors to mend his ways and hopes at
least to be able to fashion his future in
accordance with what he believes are the
high designs of morality. It is a season
in which the passions of man re for the
tirce being allayed, and in which good
will is expressed from man to man and at
least, as the prayer book has it, from na
tion to nation. It is the season that em
phasizes the government of God: the ex
istence of God's kingdom on earth, and
strongly asserts the hope that every ideal
of mankind will ultimately triumph and
that the rife and contention that keep
humanity asunder will pass away.
The trial of Captain Dreyfus is not im
portant to Israel because the defendant
is a Jew. but because fanaticism, race
hatred and political chicanery are en
deavoring to make all Jews co-defendant
with the unhappy victim of Fijench po
litim! and military injustice.

TIDE OF TROOPS
IS TURNING TO
THE WESTWARD
Volunteers Will Soon
Be Home.
The military tide is turning westward
| again, and regiments departing for the
Philippines will soon be more numerous
i than those arriving from there. Already
j two are here awaiting their chance to be
1 away, and three more will arrive before
! the month is well advanced. Recruits are
' again coming in. and officers are being as-
I signed to the commands now in the isl
| ands or going there.
Reports from Manila announce the sail
! ing of the Kansas men on Sunday morn
ing; the Minnesota. Washington and
Montana troops are now on the ocean,
and the Tennessee and lowa regiments,
the only State volunteers now in the
j Philippines, will be away for home before
' September 20. Soon after that date the
! first of the new regiments from this coun
try will have arrived, and from then on
the remainder of the ten commands will
â¢be hurried across the sea. The first to
I arrive will be three Eastern regiments
sent by way of the Suez canal and the
Indian Ocean from New York. The three
transports that will leave them at Manila,
the Thomas. Logan and Meade, will then
be put on the transport service in the Pa
: cific. which seems to indicate that the last
of the trcop= for Manila have sailed from
New York.
The Thomas. Logan and Meade are ves
sels similar to the Sherman and Grant,
ships with a capacity of from 1500 to 200
soldiers. The Hancock, Sheridan and
Warren are almost as big, and it is prob
able that these eight transports will do
the bulk of the transportation, and sev
eral of the chartered vessels will be re
turned to their owners.
The Sherman, Sheridan. Grant, Warren.
Hancock, Thomas, Logan and Meade are
all owned by the Government. The other
transports here, at Manila or going or
coming between here and there, are all
chartered vessels. Two more have been
added to the fleet, the Olympia a:.: Rio
Janeiro, to prevent delay in getting the
new regiments away, but they will not
make more than one trip. The big trans
ports from the East will not be ready for
service on the Pacific for two months or
more, and by that time all the State vol
unteers will have been carried home and
the new regiments will be in the islands,
go the eight big ships should be able to
handle the tranic. If they cannot, there
are two or three more on the Atlantic
coast that may be sent over here.
This evening the Twenty-seventh In
fantry should arrive from Fort Meade,
Pennsylvania. It is under command of
Colonel James M. Bell, with the following
fiÂ«ld officers and surgeons: Lieutenant
Colonel Albert S. Cummins, Majors
George S. Byram, Edward B. Cassatt and
Clyde D. v. Hunt; surgeons, Major Ogden
Rafferty, Captain William Bowen and
First Lieutenant Leonard K. Graves.
The Thirtieth Infantry, now being ren
dezvoused at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, will
leave there so as to reach here September
10. It is commanded by Colonel Cornelius
Gardner, with Lieutenant Colonel James
R. Campbell and Majors Leonard A. Lay
ering. Matthew F. Steele and Thomas L.
Hartlgan as field officers. The surgeons
are Major John R. McDill, Captain James
J. Erwin and First Lieutenant Albert H.

The third regiment scheduled for the
Presidio is the Thirty-second infantry,
which will leave Fort Leavenworth. Kan

El HERE re very many grave issues
| that will offer themselves for serious
consideration during the coming year.
Zionism will reach a climax, that is to
say, it will offer itself for decisive action
to the Jews of the world. That it will not
be universally accepted by them is a fore
pone conclusion, but the great danger will
be in the manner and style of its rejec
tion. I: care be not taken I fear that the
passions of the Zionists will be so aroused
that they may be tern] to do some
thing that might injure the cause of the
Jew as a retaliation upon those who could
not side with them.
I believe that the principles of justice
will receive fresh vindication at the hands
of the French people and that the dings
of the present court-martial will exoner
ate from blame the previous court-mar
tial, on the ground that from the evi
dence submitted to it it could nut have
reached any other verdict, but that in the
light of the additional evidence submitted
to the present body they find Dreyfus not
guilty of treason.

Eg HERE is no doubt that the Jewish
| New Year is of great religious, ethical
and social value to the members of
the race. Thousands of Jews who during
the year seldom if ever enter the place of
worship are instinctively drawn to the
synagogue and the early associations and
religious feelings are once m re awak
ened. While admitting that many of the
good resolutions that are made at the be
ginning of the year are broken, still
there is a tendency to make the .â â¢â¢rage
Jew better; his heart softens, his mind
withdraws itself from ordinary pursuits,
and at any rate for a tin. he feels a re
generated and elevated being.
Nor can we underrate the importance
of the new year as a mi ant of reconciling
estranged friends. Many members of
families that have rifted from one an
other are reunited, and the domestic vir
tues which have been the pride of the
Jewish people are considerably strength
ened by the reunion of different members
of the family.

jasper McDonald was asked yesterday '
if the committee of seven would present I
a large list of names from which me con- '.
venUon may se.ect eighteen acceptable
candidates for the boara.or simply submit j
eighteen names. Mr. McDonald replied i
that he understood that the committee â 
would recommend eighteen men and asK I
the convention to place them on the \
ticket as candidates for tne Board of !
Supervisors. He said the convention j
would no; be bound to nominate the men i
recommended by the committee.
It was suggested to Mr. McDonald that !
the committee of seven might be out- ;
witted by subtle scheme! o: the railroad, |
water and gas monopolies, and induced .
through misapprehension to place a few j
agtnts of the corporations on the list of J
the recommended.
Mr. McDonald said he would be in j
favor of announcing in advance the ]
names recommended by the committee, j
so that public discussion could be had j
before the delegates registered a choice j
in convention. He was not authorized to
speak for the committee, but could see j
no harm in king the list public before I
the convention passed judgment on the i
recommendations. He was sure that the j
Democratic Convention would endeavor j
to obtain the best material for the Board j
of Supervisors, as it was well known that j
the Republican Convention Intended to j
nominal the best citizens of that party
attainable for service on the boiird.
Many gates to the Democratic Con- j
vention are now convinced that mistake
was made in delegating to a committee 1
of seven the power to submit a list of
candidates for the board. Names other
than those recommended by the com- <
mittee may be placed before the con- I
vention, but those having the stamp of j
the committee's indorsement will be re- !
garded as men In whom Gavin McXab j
and Mayer Phelan repose special con- i
fidence, and therefore have great advan
tage over those having no such indorse
ment. Again it is clear to many members
that a corporation can hoodwink a com
mittee of seven much easier than it can
a convention, of three hundred and sev
enty.
The knowledge that Republicans have
resolved to bring forward citizens of high
standing for the Supervisorial ticket is
acting as a spur to Democratic activity ,
along the same tin". If the Republicans, !
through lack of vigilance or failure to ex
ercise good common sense, allow a weak
man or a corporate tool to be placed on
the ticket, the voters will scratch the j
name, -and indorse some one of the eigh
teen candidates put forward by the Demo
crats. Each one of the eighteen Super
visors is elected by a vote at large. Wards |
.fnd districts cut no figure in the contest.
From the thirty-six candidates to be
presented by the two leading conventions
the voter may select eighteen intelligent
and worthy men. to vote for.

I \ scheme, involving millions of dol- |
1^ !ars and intended to combine the \
I grape-growers and wine-makers of
* California for the purpose of main
taining prices of vineyard products,
has collapsed. The first was the effort '
of the California Wine-makers' Corpora- j
tlon to reorganize for another five years.
The present failure Is oonnected with the
offer of Henry J. Crocker to buy all the j
dry wine grapes in the State for a period '
of seven years at the rate of $12 and $14
per ton.
When Mr. Crocker made his proposal
to the vlticulturists it was enthu
siastically received throughout all the
dry-wine districts, and long resolu
tlons were adopted indorsing the offer.
The movement was regarded of so much j
Importance that the Chamber of Com- j

called a meeting of the principal growers
and wine merchants in the hope of mak
ing the enterprise a success. The meet-
Ing was highly enthusiastic and strong
resolutions were passed with the prospect
that They would have the desired effect.
It transpired that there were influential
men in the business who did not favor
Mr. Crocker's plan, und they did not hesi
tate to say so and predict that it would
be a failure, or to declare that higher
prices could be obtained for grapes during

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
A Free Trial Treatment Sent Privately by Mail to All Who
Suffer.
A Remarkable Remedy for a Terrible Affliction â The Cure Is
Permanent,
A free trial treatment Is being sent out
by the State Medical Institute in ordei
to demonstrate the fact that the most
horrible of all diseases can be cured.
There Is a good deal of controversy over
this subject among those who declare the
disease incurable, but the facts are in-
dubitable and must be acknowledged. The
uction of this new remedy is peculiar. The
lihysiciun in charge of the Institute has
had a long and varied experience treating ,
this disease of the blood, and about two j
yearn ago, after a long series of experi- |
rnents, he found the exact specific that <
offsets' the poison, renders it lifeless and |
eliminates it from the body. Having per-
sonally examined many hundreds of cases
and familiarized himself with every de- '
tail of the disease, hi* discovery came ;
naturally and has never failed him. One
of his recent cures was a most hopeless |
<nsp, the disease having caused the hair i
to faH out and the body was one mass of
putrescent sores, bolls, blotches and un-
sightly disfigurements. In ten days tho j
eutlre outer skin was healed and there I
what he calls the shortsightedness of the
grower, he realizes that he has escaped
a great deal of hard work and worry.
His circular letter to the producers ex
plaining why he has been forced to
abandon the scheme, will be Bent out
within a few days.
The Crocker offer has attracted much
attention among those whose interests
are In the industry. In discussing the
proposition yesterday Charles E. Bowen
Of the Wetmore-Bowen Company called
attention to several features of the case
that have not heretofore been brought
forward. From a legal standpoint he
thinks that even had the required per
centage of contracts been secured the
tiromoter would have met with many em
barrassing and costly complications. In
the first place, It is an unfortunate fact
that a large majority of the vineyards
of the State are mortgaged to their full
value and many are not at the preseni
time worth the face of the mortg.ig''.
Furthermore the hapless vineyardist has
been compelled to mortgage his crop for
one or more years. The chattel mortgage
takes precedence of the realty liability.
Under these conditions it Is trie conten
tion of Mr. Bowen that Mr. Crocker
would have been powerless to absolutely
control the output of the vineyards aa
was his intention and that, therefore, he
would have been unable to regulate the
prices of wine.
Notwithstanding the collapse of the
two great schemes mentioned, the vlnl
cultural outlook for this season Is bright.
In sptaking of the situation last even-
Ing. Secretary Hotchkiss of the Cali
fornia Wine-makers' Corporation said:
"There is no doubt that grapes will
bring good prices this year. In the first
place. Mr. Crocker's offer has tended to
fix values, owing to the fact that his
competitors have offered as high as $16
per ton, and it is my opinion that the
prices will range from %12 to $K> per ton
for this crop. Other features of the case
are that there will he a short vintage and
that the cellars are practically empty.
In short '99 will be a Rood year for the
grower of grapes. What the condition
may be next year in the event of a good
crop is something that no man can tell.
We have the consolation of knowing
1 wever, that there Is a well-established
and growing demand for the products of
our vineyards."

respects. A brief continuation of the rem-
edy brought about a radical cure.
The free trial treatment has saved a
great many who otherwise were doomed
to early destruction, and it was this ob-
ject which Induced the institute to make
the offer. In all cases where the sores
have become characteristic of the disease
the sufferer fully realizes the name ajid

NATIVES READY
FOR THE OUTING
OF THE BEAR
Santa Cruz Preparing
for the Ninth.
BIG NIGHT PARADE ARRANGED
JOINT COMMITTEE COMPLETES
ITS LABORS.
California to Have tbe Biggest Birth
day Party in Her History â From
San Francisco Alone Will
Go 4000 Sons.
It's all over except the fireworks and the
shouting. At Its meeting last night the j
joint ninth of September committee of i
the Native Sons of the Golden West com- '
pleted the last of the Important prelim- j
maries to the big celebration to take place i
in Santa Cruz on the 9th, and all that re- j
mains to do Is uncork the red flra and \
get aboard the special train on Friday
night.
The fact that 1900 Is to be the very big
gest year any festive Natives Son or
Daughter ever saw has not dampened
present-day enthusiasm one whit. This
year's birthday party at Santa Cruz is
to be the largest thing of Its kind that
has happened since the great event of
'91. to which all loyal natives date back. |
Santa Cruz has thrown the gates wide
open and extended Invitation to every
member of the order who can crowd in ro
come along and assist In removing the
content?. The citizens of the seaside city
have come liberally to the front with a
grist of gooii hard dollars, and every re- j
port from that direction carries a promise
of a reception and a celebration that has j
never had equal in all the town's history
of hospitality.
As a result of it all, San Francisco alone
is going to Bend forth 40mi 30ns, not count
ing families and friends and the local j
ranks will be augmented by :ho four
flourishing parlors of Marin Countyâ San
Rafael, Mount Tamalpais. Sea Point and
Nicasio. James P. Dockery, who is acting
as grand marshal and is busy with tne
details of the big night parade from N.
S. G. W. Hall to the ferry, says that the
lowest estimate of those who will go out ,
from Oakland, Marin and San Francisco j
Is 7500, but he would not undertake to
calculate the number of people who will
buy their tickets and go down simply to
see the fun.
The parades, both here and in Santa
Cruz, made the principal tonic of discus
sion at the meeting last night. Althoueh
the general plan of the procession to the
depot on Friday night had been outlined,
the details were at six.-s and Bevens, and
it took a good hour to so straighten them
out that matters could progress. The band
committee had only one band and three
or four drum corps to report, and things
were looking just a bit unhandy until ttv*
representatives of the different parlors
got to handing In their own reports. Gold
en Gate Parlor will have a band of six
teen pieces, and Hesperian will have the
game but it is piling Golden Gate one
better, with a drum major. l'"th parlors
will take their music through to Santa
Cruz, and in the parade at that end of the
line Hesperian Parlor will have Las Lo
mas Parlor of the Native Daughters as a
marching partner. Pacific Parlor will also
tak" a band of sixteen pieces, and the
Athens, Piedmont and Brooklyn parlors
Of Oakland will baVe bands of twelve
pieces. ESI Dorado, Rlncon, National,
Precita, Marshall and San Francisco jiiir
lora will carry drum corps of from three
to fourteen members.
Colonel Duboci- and the California vol
unteers arc to be invited to participate.
The railroad company has offered a spe
cial rate to the regiment of $1 50 for the
round trip, and a committee composed of
1.. F. Byington, president of the joint
committee; J. F. Dockery, Fred Lees and
Percy Long, will call upon the colonel to
morrow to extend a formal invitation.
Sheriff Milton Besse of Santa Cruz,
grand marshal of the order, was present
at the meeting ami outlined the plan of
the Santa Cruz committee. He stated that
the morning parade would form at the
depot at 11 o'clock sharp and would move
at thai hour, whether there was any one
to march or not. Objection was raised to
the early hour, and it was decided to ap
ply to the railroad to have the hour of
leaving on Saturday morning changed
from 7:45 to t>:4.",, in order that those who
do not leave on Friday might have time
to participate in the opening of the gen
eral celebration.
As the schedule now stands, a special
train over the narrow gauge is to leave
at 8:30 Friday night, and two more at 7:45
and 8:15 Saturday morning. The broad
gauge will leave at 9 o'clock Saturday
morning. Tickets, at $2 50 for the round
trip, will be good to return until the 12th.

A ROMPING PLACE
FOR CHILDREN
PUBLIC PLAYGEOUNDS SOUTH
OF MARKET STREET.
The little children south of Market
street are sogn to have a public play
ground, somewhere in the district bound
ed by Sixth, Second, Market and Harri
son streets. The Merchants' Association's
officers and the ladies of the California
: JJlub have been at work on this project
j for several weeks, and matters are be
ginning to assume shape. A year or more
j ago the ladies of the clutÂ» established a
playground for children at Hyde and
Bush streets and fitted the same with
springboards, parallel bars, seesaws,
teeters, etc., and the place has been so
well patronized that the move was start
ed to secure grounds in other parts of the
city. In the East, where the children of
the crowded centers of habitation have
no chance to romp after the manner of all
young, public grounds have proved to bo
| of an inestimable advantage. Before they
i were established the youngsters were
obliged to play on the streets or not frolic
; at all.
As might be expected, the number of
! accidents from being run down by vehi
cles and horses was large, but since the
experiment was made the list of fatali
ties has fallen off materially. That knowl
edge was what started the good ladles of
j the California Club, and the first experi
] ment here was so successful that the
i merchants' organization took up the work
of assisting the club to establish more.
Superintendent King of the association,
during his recent trip to the East, made
a study of public playgrounds, and when
he was called into this enterprise he de
cided that the children needing fresh air
the most are those in the thickly Inhabit
ed district mentioned.
Several lots are under consideration by
Mr. King and the ladies of the club, and
one will be selected very soon. It will be
flitted with all of the appliances for
amusement and exercise of the other
grounds, and it is very likely that a hand
ball court will be added. If the lot chosen
be large enough a small baseball ground
will be laid out. When the proposed
I grounds have been selected and arranged
the association and club will begin prepa
rations for another playground, beyond
Sixth street toward the Mission, where
the children are many and the chances
for innocent fun are few.
INTERSTATE
ASSEMBLY OF
EXPERT MINERS
Plans of the Coast
Association.
GENERAL ADVANCE FOR LAWS
ANNUAL STATE CONVENTION
ON OCTOBER 23.
The California Miners' Association
After Revision of Federal Min
ing Laws and a Secretary
of Mining.
The mining States and Territories of
the entire Pacific Coast region are to join
in the annual convention of the Califor
nia Miners' Association next month, ac
cording to present plans, and the conven
tion promises to be the most Important
onÂ© held since the organization of this
big association eight years ago.
President J. H. Neff, in conference with
Secretary E. H. Benjamin and other
members of the executive committee, yes
terday, decided to call the annual con
vention this year for October 23 and suc
ceeding days! There will be many mat
tors of interest and importance before
the convention this year, but the para
mount features are to be the revision and
amendment of the Federal mining laws
and the creation of a Cabinet Department
of Mines, two matters which the Califor
nia Miners' Association began to agitate
in its infancy and which it will now take
hold cf with especial energy.
As the entire mining industry is in
terested in these measures the rest of the
mining States are to be asked to help
make the convention an interstate affair.
Each Governor is to be requested to ap
point ten delegates and to name influen
tial men who will attend. With the pres
ent Mfc in the mining field there is every
prospect of a cordial response and a large
attendance from neighboring States,
while the Increased interest in the asso
ciation, with its membership of 9000 in the
mining counties, insures a big body of
regular delegates.
The committees of the association in
charge of the arrangements for the annu
al meeting of the American Institute of
Mining Engineers, beginning on the 25th
inst., met last night to consider progress.
Secretary Benjamin reported active pre
parations by Boards of Supervisors and
local committees to entertain the visitors
during their two weeks' trip about the
State and read the itinerary as published
in The Call. It was estimated that besides
the local entertainments provided by dif
ferent communities the association would
need about $6000, which would be easily
raised.
RECEPTION TO THE
CALIFORNIA REGULARS
PLAN ON FOOT TO FITTINGLY
RECEIVE THEM.
Initial Meeting of Relatives Held at
the Home of Mrs. Baird Last
Nightâ What They Pro
pose to Do.
A movement is under way to give the
' numbers of the Fourteenth, Eighteenth
and Twenty-third Infantry Rogriments,
Fourth Cavalry and Third Artillery a re
ception on their arrival In this city. This
was suggested by reason of th. fact that
in all the organizations mentioned there
; are scores of California boys who, un
willing <>r too late to join the ranks of
the Kirs; California Volunteers, yet anx
to go to the front In defense of their
I flag Â« i fisted in the regular army.
Mrs. V. C. Baird, who resides at 2513
j Pacific avenue, was the originator of the
i idea and she set the ball rolling by call
ing a meeting at her residence last night.
The notice of the proposed meeting was
published in the three dailies and as a
result Mrs. Balrd's home was crowded to
overflowing. The lady had expected but
two dozen, but she was agreeably sur
prised to discover that there are Innu
merable relatives of the men living in this
city.
The Initial meeting was for the purpose
of discussing the best means of arrang
ing a reception to the boys, not, however,
on the gigantic scale In which the gal
lant Firsi was received, but in a manner
thai wmilii fittingly express the delight
the folks at home felt In having their
loved ones once more in their midst. J.
K. Baird, who is a brother of a member
I of the First California Regiment and also
!of one In the Fourteenth Infantry,
called the relatives to order. An informal
discussion foHowed his statement of the
object of the meeting, after which a com
mittee, consisting of .Mrs. Russell Bassett,
sister of Captain and Corporal Sparrowe
of Company t; and one of the hardest
! workers in the reception to the returned
heroes; Alex Mann and J. \V. Burso i,
whose sons are in one of the organiza
tions, was appointed to arrange a meet
ing place. The commands mentioned aie
expected here on the 14th. it is highly
probable that the new body of relatives
after organizing will appeal to the ;xec
tive committee for funds to assist it in
carrying on its plan of reception. The
next meeting of the relatives will be held
the Inter part of the week. Due notice
ot same will be given in the daily papers.
BRUTALITY OF POUND MEN.
Two of Them Seize a Poodle and
Grossly Abuse Its Owner.
Although the Police Judges have im
posed severe penalties upon deputy
poundkeepers who abuse citizens while
seizing their canines, they will not take
a lesson and continue to display un
necessary brutality in the performance
of their duty.
Yesterday morning Andrew Moffat, a
man of small stature, who arrived from
the Klondike about a week ago, and is
temporarily living at 32 Natoma street,
was standing on the corner of Natoma
and Second streets. He had a small
Spanish poodle in his arms which his
wife had obtained in South America be
fore they went to the Klondike.
The pound wagon drove up and two
deputies jumped off. One of them grab
bed hold of Moffat's wrist and twisted
it around while the other kicked his legs
from under htm and he fell on the
ground. They took the poodle from him
and when he demanded an explanation
telling them that he was simply on a

struck him on the nose and told him
gruffly that he should have had. a tag
on the doer.
Moffat and his wife called at police
headquarters and made a complaint
against the deputy pound men, but they
were advised to apply for warrants for
their arrest this morning and they prom

CORRALING SALMON.
A few days ago the Fish and Game
Commissioners learned that an illegal ob
struction to the migration of fish had
been placed in the Tuolumne River, and
on Sunday Deputies C. A. Vogelsang and
Kercheval made a trip to the place men
tioned. Near Grayson they found that
parties, without the proper fear of the
law or consideration for "the fish of the
future, had placed across the river a fine
wire fence, through which salmon and
shad could not pass. A cleverly con
structed pocket had been put into the
wire, so that every fish attempting to go
up or down the river would surely be
caught. The material of the Illegal trap
must have cost considerable.
The deputies ripped out the obstruction
which was turned over to the township
Constable, and then they destroyed all
of the anchorage, etc., on the banks. So
far the parties who put in the trap have
not been discovered, but if they are they
will be prosecuted vigorously. The mini
mum fine for this offense is $100, and as
the case can be tried in the Superior
Court the offenders are likely to receive
a greater punishment. The commission
is determined to break up this gang of
law breakers.

FLAXEH-HAIRED
MERCHANT LEO
HER TO DESERT
Why Florence Merle
Left Her Husband.
Oak:.. I Office San Francisco Call.
9US Broadway, Sept. 1
A default having been entered in the
divorce suit of B. J. v. Merle against
Florence â â¢ Merle, brought recently on
the ground of desertion, the taking of
testimony will be begun before Court
Commissioner Habcock -morrow.
Since the tiling of the suit it has de
veloped that a llaxen-haired Oakland
merchant was the object for which pretty
Florence Merle deserted her husband, but
this merchant is not named nor referred
to m the husband's complaint.
The parties were married in Contra
Costa County in ISSI. Both were children
o. well-to-do ranchers there and the
match was considered a fortunate one.
About six years ago the young couple,
tinner of the quiet scenes on the old farm,
and pining for the excitement of city life,
moved to Oakland. There the husband
found employment as a motorman on the
A .an.- electric railway, and during
his busy moments, it seems, his erstwhile
sedate farm lassie learned too many of
the ways that lead to matrimonial
troubles in city life, until one day the
nustiand. to his horror, learned that his
wife's affections had been alienated by a
flaxen-haired nn reliant. Soon thereafter
the wife left the husband she had taken
for better or for worse to care for their
two little children. She has never ap
peared to answer the divorce suit.
A pitiful ease of a young girl seeking
a divorce, also on the ground of desertion.
Is recited in the complaint by Edith Horan
against Denis Horan, a section â¢ man
In the employ of the Southern Pacific
Company. li appears that a year ago
the plaintiff, then Miss Edith 'Murphy.
ag^d 1, years, met Horan at her parents'
l.oardtng-house in Redding. A friendship
sprang up between the couple which rip
ened into something more serious, for one
day when Horan left the old hov.se for
good it developed that he had promised
to lead Edith to the altar. Aft. waiting
several Wfek^ for his return the girl set
out to search for her prospective spouse.
Through the kindly offices of Colonel
Dimpfel. then secretary of the Society
for the Prevention of Vice. Horan was
located and induced through a ruse to
come to Oakland, where a Deputy Sheriff
placed him under arrest immediately. In
jail he was persuaded that ho had best
(â¢xecutehispiumiseofmarria.se. He final
ly consented, and Dr. Coyle of the First
Presbyterian Church spoke the solemn
word.- that united the couple. The marital
bliss, however, was of short duration, for \
within v few days Horan deserted the
little woman and left her to eke out an
existence as best she could. Hence the
divorce suit;

REMARKABLE FLIGHT OF
TWO COVEYS OF QUAIL
SAUSALITO, Sept. 4.â Two coveys <f
quail performed a remarkable feat this
morning. The first covey flow across the
bay from Belvedere to this place âa dis
tune- of over two and a half mil^s â and
alighted upon the cornice of the building
In which Brover & Glynn conduct their
poolroom. Fifteen mitiutes later the per
formance was repeated by a second bevy
of the strong winged birds, but these lat
ter soared Dp the hillside and disappeared
In the brush.
Incredible as Buch a fo.it may seem, in
view of the distance and the known an
tipathy of a quail to a flight across a
broud body of water, there are numerous
witnesses to the occurrence. Eugene
Dukich. a wharfinger in the employ of the
North Pacific Coast Railway Company,
stood at the ferry at C o'clock this morn
ing and saw both coveya coming across
the water. George Ryan and Fred Line
ley saw the first bevy alight upon the
poolroom building. Two quails, a male
and a hen, remained on the cornice of
the structure until late in the evening.
Tiiis la perhaps the first time a quail was
ever known to fly across San Francisco
Hay, and the strangeness of the event is
increased by the fact that the feat was
performed by two coveys.
PASADENA SUFFERS FROM
A SCARCITY OF WATER
PASADENA, Sept. 4.â The west side nf
town has been suffering from a water
famine for some weeks past. Ma:iy resi
dents of the higher sections have not
been able to gi-i water In their bathtubs.
Particularly is this true in i me â  t the
handsome residences on Orange drove
and Grand avenues, where Walter <;.
Ladd, Professor T. S. C. Lowe, Robert J.
Hurdette ;md other personages have
built mansions. Some of these house
holders threaten to refuse to pay water
rent and let the company sue them to
teFt the riclits of <-i>nsumers.
On Baturday the Inhabitants of the west
side of town were notified that th"y must
not water their lawns, because the water
was SO scarce. This edict caused such a
rommotlon that it had to be. raised to
day. For two weeks past no streets on
[be west side have been sprinkled. The
scarcity of water is probably due to the
fi rest fires which have raged during tne
;wo or three years. One of these
fires iP now burning in the Sierra Madres,

Sensational Story of
Mrs. Kinsner.
Oakland Office San Francl3co Call.
90S Broadway. Sept. 4.
Mrs. Helena E. Kinsner, residing at 1220
Seventh street, who last week filed suit
against the Oakland Transit Compare for
$50,000 damages on account of injuries al
leged to have been 'sustained by reason
of a car of defendant corporation sudden
ly starting ahead as she was about to
J alight ut Eighth and Union streets, tells
I a remarkably sensational story of being
subjected to most shocking treatment at
the hands of the corporation physicians.
A peculiar feature of Mrs. Kinsner's in
juries wus the subsequent fact alleged in
her complaint that she was about to be
come a mother and that by reason of the
accident her maternal hopes were not
realized.
Mrs. Kinsner declares that since the fil
ing of the damage suit she has been vis
ited by a representative of the corpora
tion, named Ferrin, who appeared in the
capacity of a detective or claim adjuster,
and who notified the Injured woman that
he "would not give twenty-five cents for
her Injuries," bo Mrs. Kinsner stated to
day.
'"But the most shocking and audacious
treatment I was subjected to last Satur
day " said Mrs. Kinsner, who is confined
to 'her bed, "was when two railroad phy
siciansâDrs. Frank Adams and D. D.
Crowley â entered my house and bed
chamber unceremoniously, without invi
tation or consent on my part, and de
manded the right to make certain phys
ical examinations.
"The two doctors rang our door bell
about 11 o'clock last Saturday morning.
Our houseglrl answered the tall, and
wlkh she opened the door the doctors
brushed by her without stating whom
! they desired to see or the object of their
! yjsit in the hallway Just outside my
1 chamber door one of them set his case
o f tools Then they came Into my room,
and Dr Adams started to raise the cur
< tain, announcing that he had come to
mike certain i-xaminations as to my con
dition and Injuries. The girl and I were
aloi c In the house, and 1 promptly or
dered the doci irs out of my room. I told
â  that 1 was and had been under the
care and treatment â¢>( I>r. Kergan, and
aliy! wished to know rould be
Imparted to them by my physician.
"T was horrified and greatly alarmed.
I raised myself up in bed and declared
that l would '-.til for help If they dared
to appr iach or touch me. They
there bo boldly thai 1 was awfully fright-
Had my husband been here I would
not have answered for results. Finally
4}r Crowley remarked thai he would step
outside In the hall and await Dr. Adams,
who still Insisted on his rights as a rep
resentative of the company we are suing;
but I ordered him away under threat
that I would send for my husband, and
I after further parley they departed."

NIGHTMARE OF
A MURDERER'S
GUILTY SOUL
Clay Clement Hears
the Bells.
A physiological study Is one of the most
profitable stage difficulties a man. can
handle, for since there is no parallel in
human experience, the tone of treatment
must be purely the imaginative, built
from a conception rather than a model,
and there Is always the possibility that
the intelligence of an audience is being
cajoled into believing the impersonation
far more wonderful than it Is. This is
especially true of "The Bells," for the
last act Is what lingers in the memory,
the dream of a murderer's guilty con
science; a murderer, too, who could use
an ax and then burn the body of his vic
tim in a lime kilnâ and Aiio shall say
what degree of awful agonized striving
may or may not till the sleep of such.'
Let a telling note of terror be struck and
held and an audience Is carried Inevitably
on, wide-eyed to approval and applause.
It is rather dangerous ground for the
not-too-sure footed to tread upon, but the
man who does not come to It gropingly
may win half his reputation in a single
night. This is a rather negative approach
to praise, and praise is due. Mr. Clement 3
fondness for the single figure has made a
specially wise choice in Mathias. The
habit of thought brings him to the char
acter well equipped; not that his work
in the first two acts is especially con
vincing, for in the early scenes he is the- j
atrical, and his unsympathetic voice often
makes void his designs. Not until the
dream does be bring the needed tempera
ment. Her- long familiarity with the role
seems to have made It plastic in his
hands; he might alter its details with
absolute conviction that he would not j
alter its essential characteristics, and
there is no tendency to expand the busi
ness beyond the thought it has to con
vey. Mr. Clement Is a tremendously sin
cere actor, and this has been the saving
salt of many a lesser light. With his
dream scene he makes a permanent mark
on the character. Mr. Cook's Father Wal
ter was the performance one expects from
an artist. He was from the beginning in
stinct with the mood 01 the old gossip, :
and his disguise was bo successful that
I looked on my programme to identify
him. Miss O'Malley was a good Sozel and
a picturesquely funny one. and those who
conducted the trial worked unostenta
tipusly and well. The others inclined to
the habitual in their parts as being safer,
and will add nothing to their reputations
by the result. The lights were not well
managed. They v.-ere, for the most part,
too strong, making the dying away
through shadow to darkness an impossi
bility. Irving is certainly a master of
light. The scenery, though pleasant to
trie eye, was suggestive of neither period
nor place. The second act was very pret
tily set. but Inexcusably Incorrect in de
tail. Properties, however decorative,
should not be put upon the stage to dis
cord with a knowledge of the fitness of
things. CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
Tivoli.
What the prologue i S to "I P.igliacei"
i the Toreador song is to "Carmen," there
i fore a barytone who possesses any
: musical Judgment at all and understands
how to enhance his solo with dramatic
j color never falls to create enthusiasm.
â  Wh-Ti this success may be attained by a
' \ -iji alist of fairly good reputation and a
passable voice. It may easily be under
i stood what a man like Salassa can make
i out of it with a barytone of big resonani c
: and dramatic timbre. Naturally enough
; the Toreador sons waa the great feature
of the performance of "Carmen" at the
Tlvoll last evening. And throughout the
play Mr. Salassa never for a moment lost
any of the Intensity of action and the
bravado which the part requires.
In order to essay the role of Don Jose
i creditably dramatic temperament la re-
I quired, and, while Aveda.no did not always
! prove to be possessed of that gift, he
i surprised every one by giving quite a dra.
, matic representation of that part. Both
the finale of the third and fourth acta
| were rendered with the necessary adher-
I ence to the climax. Although Avedano
was somewhat hoarse, the general excel
| lence of his work was not much marred.
Of course Michaela is there to sing the
grand aria in the third act, and if she
.succeeds in rendering this well she ha 3
done her duty. Mfss Erossnlta sang that
aria with much taste and sincerity. She
imbued it with all the romantic color that
i it requires, and proved herself once more
a thorough artist.
Many a contralto has tried her luck on
Carmen, but few have succeeded in mak
i ing a success of it. In fact, it is no mis
take to assert that there are to-day not
more than two or three really good Car
! mens on the stage. Nol because of the
vocal responsibilities, but more particu
larly because of the dramatic execution,
'â  and especially because of the personal ap
pearance of the character. Let a Carmen
â¢ look a Carmen, and you have a foundation
whereon you may easily build the dra
matic edifice, and a good contraltoâ it
need not be phenomenal -will complete
I the ideal Carmen. Miss J,iiK-k makes a
very honest effort to portray the part,
but while her elocutionary actions may
not lack vigor, neither her appearance
nor her voice comes up to the require
ments There runs throughout the:
i strains sung by Carmen an undweurrent
!Â{ passion which necessitates a solid
tower register. Miss Linck does not pos
sess thai solid lower register, and hence
Bhe falls short. To-night 'â Romeo and
Juliet." ALFRED METZGER.

OWNERSHIP OF THF
TENT IS IN DISPUTE
NEVILLE & CO. CLAIM THEY DID
NOT SELL IT.
Citizens' Committee Insists That It
Purchased It and Proposes
to Keep It.
Considerable work la still ahead of the
citizens' executive committee, and it will
likely take several days before It will be
ready to make a final report In connection
with the reception to the California vol
unteers. The committee met yesterday in
the office of Mayor Phelan. A. M. Law
rence was the only member who was not
present.
The startling information was conveyed
that the tent at Union square was not the
property of the committee, and that the
$250 charged for it by Neville & Co. was
for rental only. Secretary McPike, who
made the original bargain, Insisted that it
was his understanding that the canvas
house had been purchased for the figure
named, and that he had never heard any
thing about a renting proposition. The
representative of Neville & Co. said the
idea of selling the tent for $250 was ridic
ulous, as the material in it alone cost
more than that, leaving the labor out of
the question entirely. It was decided to
have the tent experted to arrive at its
exa'^t value. Tn the meantime Xeville's
bill wiw "hung up."
The report ot the finance committee was
read, and upon motion of YV. J. Martin
a. vote of thanks was extended to its
chairman, M. H. de Young, for the able
manner In which he- handled that end of
the celebration work. The committee's
expenses amount to about $6f>o, which is
less than one per cent of the amount col
lected from the citizens.
It was decided to entertain no further
propositions for continuing the Market
street illumination, and the electric lights
were ordered removed.
There is a little misunderstanding be
tween the committee and the Native Sons
over the bills incurred for the big night
parade. Marshal Plstolesi advised the
committee that it would be expected to
make good all shortages, and hinted, that
the amount would not b>> an inconsid
erable Bum. Mr. ne Young waxed warm
over the suggestion.
"We told them before they undertook
this thing to let us know what they want
ed," he said; "that if it was reasonable
we would allow it, but that we would
stand good for nothing that we did nut
authorize. We have done our part, and
fr> m the way in which I look at it we
are through with them."
It developed that the Natives were try
ing to get the committee to pay for their
clerk hire, printing and numerous other
things that were not on the programme.
Marshal Pistolesl was invited to meet the
committee this morning and argue the
matter.
Some of the volunteers complained that
their pay waÂ« be-in g withheld under In
structions of Colonel Duboce. who ad
vised them that they could live off
their relatives and friends until they w-re
mustered out, when they would receive
their money. The committee addressed
a letter to the colonel requesting him to
relieve the financial distress of the sol
diers.

"Tommy"' Crowley Arrested for Petty

Th<?re was r.parly a fatality In the ar
mory of the battleship lowa yesterday.
The accidental discharge of a large Colt
revolver nearly killed Chief Gunner's Mate
J. Delahide and for a time it was* looked
upon aboard the warship as an attempt
at suit ide. An investigation, however,
â bowed the affair to be purely accidental, i
It is the duty of Delahide, assisted by >
Gunners Mate N. Burke, to overhaul i
every gun in the lowa's armory every j
morning. Yesterday the work was r.early â 
completed and Burke went outside, leav- |
ing Delahide looking over a Colt revol
ver. Suddenly there was a report find the
chief gunner staggered out of the ar
mory, bleeding 1 from a wound in the neck,
ami asked to be taken to the sickbay. The
ship's surgeon was soon in attendance
and pronounced Delahide's wound as not
serious. He had been looking into the
muzzle of the revolver to see if it was
clean, when he touched the trigger and it
went off. The bullet went through the
musclr-s of his n^rk, inflicting a painful
but not serious wound.
Delahide was the highest non-commis
sioned officer in one of the 8-inch turrets
on the lowa during the destruction of Cer
vera's fleet. He had just received tele
graphic news of his promotion to the poÃi
tion of boatswain, so the wound in his
neck throws a damper on his joy.

to the list of transports. She is an old
vessel, having been launched in ISTO, but
she is still a good stout ship, and her ap- j
pearance coming into port is a credit to
Captain Dixon and his crew. The Tacoma
was here years ago as the Batavia ami
In connection with the Parthia (now the
Victoria) ran under the Canadian Pacific
flag. Captain John Bermingham, l-nlted j
States Supervising Inspector of Steam
Vessels, was down to see the Tacoma yes- i
terday. He was a passenger on her i
twenty-nine years apo, when she made
her maiden voyage. The ship has been re- |
modeled in her interior works almost out
of his recollection, but still there were
many points that were the same as when
the vessel was launched.
The Government has chartered two
more steamers to carry troops to Manila.
The Olympia, formerly the British steam
er Dunbar Castle, will come here from
Seattle and the City of Rio de Janeiro
will be turned over just as soon as she
arrives here from the Orient.
There was no work done on the trans
port Centennial yesterday. All the car
penters demanded double pay on account
of its being a legal holiday and when it
was refused them they packed up their
tools and went home. The men on the
Grant and Sherman worked all day. but
they received the regular holiday wages. ;
"Tommy" Crowley, the boatman, is in
a peck of trouble and all through no
fault of his uwn. Yesterday he was ar
rested on a warrant charging him with
petty larceny and lucked up in the Har
bor Police Station. The necessary bail :
was soon forthcoming, however, and he
was released. The trouble dates back to
the arrival of the Shrrman with the Cal
ifornia boys. On that occasion the Na
tive Sons "chartered the T. C. Walker,
but' L. C. Pistoles! and I* A Morgen
stern were not on hand at sailing time,
80 the steamer sailpd without them. They
then went to Vallejo street wharf and
chartered the gasoline launch Jennie C.
from Crowley. All went well until the
: party was in midstream, when the launch
broke down. After much hard work the
Jennie C was got back to the wharf and
' Pistolest and Morgensturn were put
ashore. The two Native Sona now as
sert that ten minutes after they wore
landed Crowley was carrying passengers
out to see the Sherman come in at nt'ty
cents a head. They demanded their $10
back and Crowley refused to give it up.
Hence the petty larceny charge.
A new coasting steamer to bo called the
Santa Ana is being built at Coos Bay for
A. W. Beadle & Co. She will be 191 feet
long, 37 feet broad and 12 feet 6 inches
deep and will be launched about Novem

all the latest improvements and is ex
pected to make about twelve knots an

INTERIOR MERCHANTS
ARE COMING TO TOWN
Recently the business men of San Fran
-1 Cisco organized the Manufacturers' and
[ Wholesalers' League for the purpose of
â  inducing merchants of this and surround
in^ States to make their purchases here
i instead of sending their orders to the
East. For years past the tide of trade has
turned to the jobbers and producers of
1 the ra.stern part of the United States, the
! Western manufacturer being entirely ig
j nored. This was not because of the goods
<>f the latter being inferior, but because
\ of certain opportunities that the Eastern
I men have which the Western men have
; not.
For exajnple. a large number of the
I towns of the West exercise a right be
stowed by the Legislature to impns.- a
special tax upon drummers. Several
: times this was attempted in the cases of
drummers from Eastern houses, but
failed because the courts held that the
Kustern drummers are protected fr.mi
such tax by the interstate commerce law.
The courts, however, afforded no protec
; tion for the representatives of business
' houses of this State. Again, the railroads
I have discriminated in favor of the East
ern houses in order to get long hauls of
' the freight ordered by the country mer
: chants.
When the league came into existence
the proposition was to have the members
' stand a considerable part of the expense
! of bringing the country merchants Into
! town and showing the goods without the
1 intervention of drummers. The main in
â¢ ducement w;ts that all who accept the
! league's offer are assured half rates on
; the railroads and reduced prices for
board and amusement while here. The
visitors are expected to purchase their
; stocks of goods here in return for the
â  concessions^
Several excursions have been arrangea
; to bring to town merchants from the
entire coast. The first of these excur
sions began to arrive yesterday and all
day the clerk at the rooms of the City
Board Oi Tfade, where the visitors are
expected to register, was kept busy. Of
the 120 buyers expected from Idaho, Mon
' tana, Utah. Nevada and Arizona about
. fifty arrived during the day. and indica
tions are that the full complement will
: take advantage of the generous offer.
Many of the merchants are accompanied
by their families. It is believed that the
purchases will amount to many thousand
dollarsâ enough to warrant the enterprise
I of the league.
The other excursions will start from El
| Paso, Tex., on the 9th; from Lompoc,
; Cal., on the 23d, and Portland, Or., on
1 the 16th.
GUN FIRED BY

Wireless System in a
New Marvel.
SUCCESS OF THE EXPERIMENT
THRONGS AT THE EXPOSITION
LAST NIGHT.
Exhibitors Have Placed Their Dis
plays â Unique Features of In
terest â Elaborate Musical
Programmes.
The second day and night of the ex
| position of the Mechanics' Institute drew
far greater and more enthusia
than was expected for so early in the life
of the fair. Exhibitors are quickly tm
pleting their displays, and last night
everything was practically in place. The
\ opinion is unanimous that this year's fair
is artistically the most beautiful ever giv
en in the history of the Institute. The ex
hibitsâindustrial, mechaniral and manu
facturingâare conceded to be the best
! shown in years, and the competition
I shown will make the task of the commit
| tee of awarda a difficult one.
In entertainment the management has
' provided an interesting feature for every
| afternoon and night. The special one
: given last nigtit oxcited an interested
j throng and gave to many a physical cx
i hibition of tne meaning uf The ('all's tri
| umph In heralding toe coming of the
! Sherman by wireless telegraphy. In the
', booth of A. Vander Naillen a gun was
! fired by wireless telegraphy. Owing to
I restrictions of space it was difttcuk fr>r
I the spectators to realize that the marve!
' which they saw performed through a few
| feet of space had been performed by The
Call under greater difficulties through a
space of several miles.
But the experiment last night was a
revelation of one of the latest of physical
miracles. It illustrated one of the new
I horrors of modern warfare, which makes
possible the explosion of missiles far from
the scene of operation. In the booth on
â  the north side of the pavilion the trans
: mitting and receiving apparatus and a
; miniature cannon, loadea with powder,
were placed.
The instruments in every respect were
' such as used by The Call. The distance
between the receiving and transmitting
Instruments was about forty feet. The
cannon Â». as connected through coils and
relays with the receiving instrument.
Shortly after 8 o'clock the announce
i ment of the experiment was made
, from the bandstand and a great crowd
rushed toward the Vander Naillen booth.
At a signal the operator at the trans
mitting apparatus began to click the ra
! strument. An answering click was heard
from the receiving instrument forty feet
away. A series of sparks shot from the
I wire suspended over the touch-hole of
! the gun. There was a flash ami an explo
sion, and the gun had been fired. L.
Vander Naillen, the experimenter, says
that he has performed a similar feat with
equal success through a distance of three
j miles.
After the feat the crowd thronged the
aisles again to listen to the music and
watch the displays. Many sought the vil
lage of the Filipinos and saw a creditable
and certainly odd gymnastic display.
The little black men might show a trine
more energy in completing their village,
but they seem not to have recovered yet
from the listlessness of their Southern
i homes.

CHURCH FOLKS HAVE
A PLEASANT OUTING
ST. PETER'S PARISHIONERS AT
SHELL MOUND.
The friends, well-wishers and parish
ioners of St. Peter's church. Twenty
fourth and Alabama streets, enjoyed a
delightful outing at Shell Mound park
yesterday, thereby beneilting the church
to the amount of $1000.
It was an ideal day and the picnickers
enjoyed themselves thorouKhly. Rev.
Fatiier Casey, pastor of the church, and
his assistant, Father Lyons, mingled
with the merry throng and were among
the leaders in all the delights of the day.
Many other well-known clergymen also
joined in the festivities, among whom
were Father McDonald of St. Charles,
RÂ«?v. Father Morrison, D. D., of Oakland,
and Father Grant.
Besides the usual picnic games a cake
walk by Fred Burgess and Fannie Rous-
Beau was much enjoyed.
Three committees had charge of the
pleasant affair and the unqualified suc
(ess of the picnic is all owing to their
efforts.
On the reception committee were: D.
F Keefe. T. Slavin, P. J. Curtis, L. Cull,
Thomas R. Curtis, J^>hn Grace, Frank Mc-
Aieer, Ttarry Pinkham.
In charge of the games were: P. J.
Tormey, George Burgees, James Burke,
Thomas Butterworth. Brother Krminold
and Brother Phelan.
The committee on prizes consisted of:
L. C. Cull. Daniel Wrenn. Salvo Brinoartt.
John Wagner, Thomas O'Rourke.
Harry Pinkham and John Welch
formed the floor committee and John
Kenny was the judg" of the jig and reel
contest, awarding the first prize to Ed
ward Barry and the second prize to John
Murphy.
A charming innovation was the introduc
tion of a Mission belle. Miss Jewel Kene
flek, wno officiated as door keeper. Many
of the parishioners esteemed it such a
pleasure to have the charming lady
gather up their pasteboards that they
passed the doors many times. As no re
turn checks were issued the constant go
ing and coming helped swell the fund
considerably.

organization and intelligent co-operation
among th^ laboring classes has accom
plished, which, ho declared, furnished the
strongest possible argument in favor of
trades unions.
A. R. Andre, a member of the Brewery
Workmen's Union 1 ad a member of the
San Francisco Labor Council, delivered
the address of the day, and ills convincing
eloquence aroused great, enthusiasm. He
said:
"Labor day Is not, as la popularly
Bupposed, merely a holiday of labor.
We do not come together to celebrate
the fact that we are worklngmen and
that labor is the end of our existence,
but rather that we are banded togeth
er to better our conditions ;m-l make it
possible for as to enjoy that leisure
which is a necessary part of the civili
zation of our d;iy.
"Labor duv is a celebration of or-
ganized laborâ its struggles, its vicis
situdes and its victories. And it is
only because we are organized for self
protection that we have a Labor day
at all. Otherwise we should be prob
ably making bricks without straw 365
days in the year, as In the time of
Moses. '
"Nor do we celebrate merely the tri
fling reduction of hours and increase
of wages which our organization has
brought to us. The labor movement
has a grander motive and a nobler
object than that. Let me illustrate by
a familiar example: You have all seen
the modern skyscraper in the process
-of construction. First, the laying of
the foundation by one set of busy
workers; then the rearing of the steel
skeleton by another, and finally the
completed >?diiice Is finished by other
hands and a beautiful building is the
result. v; : :
. "So it is with organized labor. The
necessity for self-protection is the
foundation of our movement. The
trades unions, labor councils and final
ly the vast national and international
federations of labor are the means by
which we protect ourselves from op
pression to-day and make progress
possible to-morrow.
"There are a great many people who
are continually telling you that or
ganized labor, or labor oragnlzations,
are prone to attempt to win their way
by violence. That is not bo. There
v us a time, years ago, when harsher
measures were deemed necessary ad
juncts to a strike, but that time is
past. It has been said that we are all
governed by public opinion, and that
I is true to a larger extent than is gen
' erally realized. And it is by showing:
the public the strength of our posi
tion and the. justice of our demands
that we hope to win their support in
our contests for fair treatment as
workingmen. We are not opposed to
trusts and corporations as such, wo
are not opposed to the introduction of
modern machinery in the manufac
ture of the products of the country,
but we demand a small share In thÂ«
profits resulting from your labor and
my labor, from our toil and our intel
ligence.
"And this grand co-operation of the
forces of labor is the framework of a
new social order which shall give to
the producer the Just fruits of His la
bor and make possible a grander civ
ilization than the world has yet seen.
"This is the real aim and object of
labor organizations. This Is the grand â¢
motive that inspires our brothers in - ;
this grand cause and the celebration â 
of the progress of this world-wide
movement for betterment of the work-
Ing class and thereby the elevation of
society, is the holiday that has
brought us together to-day.
'.'There is no room for pessimism in
the labor movement. Organized labor
is yet an infant in this country. But
if we learn the lessons of to-day,
profit by the experience of the past
and bring to our work that enthusasm
that the cause merits, there is no
doubt that organized laÃor will ac
complish its civilizing mission and thÂ«
â¢workingman will take that place in so
ciety which he has been struggling for
through all the centuries."
P. Wellin also made a short address in
which he reiterated the assertions and
arguments made by the previous speak
ers, urging the workingmen of the city
to stand firmly together to secure the
peaceful accomplishment of their aims
and objects. Organization; he declared,
was the only means by â which the rights
of those who labor for a livelihood could
be protected and every effort should be
made to build up, strengthen and ex
pand the unions in San Francisco and

made for the theater and restaurants,
where the Jolly picnickers appeased their
appetites and prepared themselves for the
fun of the evening. This part of the pro
gramme consisted of dancing, both for
pleasure and for prizes, just enough of
the latter to flavor and not enough to
spoil the former. A large number of
valuable gate prizes were distributed dur
ing the evening. Everybody had a good
time and returned to the city about mid
night tired out, but thoroughly satisfied
with their day's outing and wishing that
there were more "Labor days" in the

DARING THIEVES

VALUABLE BOOTY
The Forbes Residence
Ransacked.
A WOMAN IS SUSPECTED
4
NEARLY $3000 WORTH OF GEMS
AND JEWELRY TAKEN.
Entrance Effected Through the Front
Door by Means of Skeleton Keys
During the Absence of
the Family.
A bold robbery was committed on Sat
urday evening at the home of Arthur W.
Forbes, 2123 Sacramento street, and nearly
$3000 worth of plunder was secured by the
thieves. It is the belief of Mrs. Forbes
that the burglary was the work of a
womnn, although she will not admit that
she has any direct suspicions as to the
identity of the guilty parties. From the
surrounding circumstances there can be
no question that the culprit was thor
oughly familiar with the premises.
On Saturday evening Mr. and Mrs.
Forbes went to the theater, leaving Mrs.
Forbes' mother, who is an invalid, and
her two nurses in the upper part of th<.>
; house. About 9 o'clock the attention of
i the nurses was attracted by the barking
of the housedog- downstairs, but as It
was not fin unusual thing for tho animal
to create a disturbance no investigation
was made. It is presumed that the
thieves were acquainted with the dog, for
j it suddenly stopped barking and remained
â¢ on the lower floor while they were ran
sacking the place.
The robbery ' was not discovered until
midnight, when Mr. and Mrs. Forbes re
| turned home. Their suspicions were
i aroused by llndlng the front door wide
open. Mrs. Forbes made a hasty search
and was not long In discovering that
nearly everything in the lower part of
the house that was of any value had been
taken. Without disturbing the things that
they did not want, the burglars went
through the dressing cases in the lower
bedroom, where Mrs. Forbes kept her
valuable -gems and jewelry, and se
cured about $1000 worth of diamonds and
about $1500 worth of jewelry, including
twenty-one scarfpins belonging to Mr.
Forbes. They also went through a cab
inet of curios of Mr. Forbes', taking a
Grecian lamp of considerable value and
a number of impressions of Pompelian
eeals that had been sent to him by friends
at the time of the excavations.
From the bedroom the robbers wont to
the dining-room on the floor bel?>w. where
they took every article of silverware that
there was in the house. They even
stripped the table that had been set for
the morning meal. A large telescope bas
ket is missing, and it is presumed that
the thieves used it to carry off their
plunder.
Returning 1o the tipper floor, the bur
glars ransacked Mr. Forbes' desk and se
cured a little over $200 in cash.
Entrance was effected by means of a
skeleton key In the front door. None of
tho other entrances nor the fastening of
the windows were disturbed.
"I am ;Hire," said Mrs. Forbes yester
day, "that the thieves were thoroughly
familiar with the house, for the reason
that they went right to the places where
the valuables were kept without disturb
ing anything else. Many of my jewels
! were hidden in out-of-the-way closets,
i but they apparently located them without
any difficulty. 1 am convinced _that the
burglary was committed under the guid
ance of a woman, although I do not sus-
PÂ«-< t any one who has been in my em
ploy."
The matter was reported to tho police,
and Detectives Gibson and Wren were
detailed on the cas<\ Part of the stolen
property ha-Â« been recovered, but there is
no clew to the identity of tho, thio,ves.

RISKED HIS LIFE TO
STOP A RUNAWAY
JOEY RICHARDSON PROVES
HIMSELF A HERO.
He Prevents an Accident by a Cour
ageous Actionâ A Thrilling Inci
dent and Dramatic Climax.
The heroic and timely action of Joey
Richardson, a youth of 15 years, pre
vented a serious accident on Harrison
Htrect, between Fourth and Fifth, yester
day morning. A powerful horse attached
to a butcher's wagon belonging to the
I X L Market was left standing unsecured'
by its owner in front of a house on Har
rison street. The careless driver allowed
a little child to sit in the wagon while he
was engaged in delivering meat. A pass
ing car rrightened the animal and it
bolted up the street toward Fifth. No
hand was put forth to stay its course.
The father of the child, unnerved by the
imminent danger of his little one, was
unable to move. Young Richardson was
made of better stuff. He was standing on
the corner holding two greyhounds wjiich
he was taking to Union Coursing Park,
and the moment he saw the runaway he
dropped tho leash and sped after the fast
moving vehicle. Seeing that in its erratic
course the horse would collide with a|
truck standing in frcnt of McNab &
Smith's old stand, he redoubled his spurt
and with a bound that would do credit to
a trained athlete he landed in the center
of the wagon, and balancing himself in
the swaying vehicle, reached the seat,
and bending far over grabbed the reins
and nulled the horse to a standstill im
mediately in front of the immovable
truck The heroic boy turned the horse
:i round and drove back to where the
father stood, weak and trembling, and
handed over his team and child, receiving
a fervent ''thank you."
The unusual incident was witnessed
by many women and children, and when
the mothers saw the sturdy lad save the
helpless babe their fervent blessings were
showered on the head of young Richard
son. A laughable part of the runaway
and rescue was the conduct of the
hounds during the Incident The faithful
dogs bounded after the boy and led him
to his objective point. They also followed
him bark to the corner and permitted
their custodian to take charge of them
again, evidently proud of his achieve
ment, judging by the wagging of their
tails and barks of approval.
APPRECIATIVE VOLUNTEERS
Express Their Heartfelt Thanks to
Native Sons and Daughters.
The California Volunteers are appre
ciative of the entertainment extended
them by the citizens of the city. Through
Major Frank Rice they have expressed
their gratitude to the Native Sons in the
following letter:
Now that the festivities connected with the
return of the California Volunteers have con
cluded I desire on behalf of myself and the
officers and men of my command to express
to the Nutlvo Sons of the Golden West our
heartfelt thanks for the many courtesies ex
tended to us In connection with our reception.
No soldiers who returned from war ever re
ceived a more penerous welcome, and the en
ergy, ability and skill displayed by ai: con
nected with the entertainment of the retum
lnt' volunteers has beÂ»n a marvel not only to
ourselves, but to the public as well. Tho past
ten days will long remain in the memories uf
all those who were connected with the enter
tainment in any way. either directly or Indi
rectly. The reception from start to finish has
been' one of th>- grandest outbursts oÂ£ popular
enthusiasm that it has ever been my privilege ,
to witness. I desire particularly to express to
the Native Daughters of the Golden Wost our
appreciation of the courtesies extended to CS
at the banquet, for all of which please accept
our heartfelt thanks. Very respectfully.
