JOHNNY
COMES MARCHING
HOME
SAN FRANCISCO'S ROYAL RECEPTION
TO THE OREGON VOLUNTEERS
OREGONIANS HAVE LOTS OF COMPANY TO THEIR CAMP.
Photo by J. R. Hodson, 416 Geary street.
The home-come men of Summers' command find close quarters in the company streets at the Presidio.
BATTLE-SCARRED, war-worn,
with ranks decimated by dis
ease and Filipino bullets, the
boys of the Second Oregon,
forming the vanguard of the
volunteer army returning from the
tropics, disembarked yesterday morn
ing from their transports and marched
through the city on their way to the
Presidio to be honorably discharged.
All San Francisco was on the street
to receive them.
Little more than a year ago the same
regiment at full strength, the flower, of
the patriotic manhood of the northern
State, headed for the front, following
the still echoing footsteps of the First
California. The same crowds that had
chorused the city's godspeed to its de
parting best beloved gathered along the
line of outward march to give the
strangers a parting cheer and wish
them luck on their way to battle. Bands
played stirring airs, the flag of their
country Hew on every side, men yelled
themselves hoarse and women fairly
showered them with fruit and flowers
and kisses. They were as sturdy look
ing a lot as one could wish to see and
high were the hopes that they would
prove towers of strength to rernforce
the boys of California in the hour of
need.
Those hopes were justified. In many
a hard-fought field the Oregonians
showed the mettle of which they were
made. From Maraqulna to San Fer
nando, in a semicircle, they swept the
island of Luzon in Wheaton's flying
brigade.. At San Pedro Macate, at Ca
loocan, ii: the charge at Ma.labon, they
had at the enemy, marking his flight
by his dead. Through Norzagaray they
went to Maasin, following their colonel
across the river under a terrific fire,
driving the enemy but of the breast
works. Their work ended at San Fer
nando, after forty onsets in as many
days, sixteen dead on th" field and
eighty-six wounded in action.
With such a record no wonder the
returning volunteers feel proud of their
regiment and their brave leader; no
wonder, despite the holes in their ranks,
the survivors thrilled at the recollection
of their deeds and held high their heads
as they put foot once again on their
native soil to march through the liv
ing streets of San Francisco, to hear
again the cheers, to see the fluttering
flags, to be showered with flowers and
bombarded with glances by the fair.
Battle-scarred, war-worn, weary as
they must have been from long confine
ment on the transports, the Oregonians
would have been less than human had
they not stepped out proudly, the heroic
figures ln one of San Francisco's mcst

great artery, it is true, than marched
so bravely to the transport fourteen
months ago. The echo of their foot
steps was less strong than the sturdy
tramp of their departure. , Their cheeks
were sallow from tropic sun and sunken
from hardship and exposure, but they
presented yesterday a picture never to
be forgotten of military virtue reward
ed by the plaudits of a patriotic people.
The men were eager for the march.
Long before the first streak of dawn
the transports Newport and Ohio
weighed anchor and steamed in from
the stream to the Folsom-street pier,
where preparations for disembarking
were soon under full head. There were
no sluggards on either ship. All were

forms; buttons were polished and bay
onets brightened; shoes were polished
and hats were dusted, and all was
ready for the descent into God's own
country. Breakfast was served aboard,
the men were lined up, and it was not
long after the sunrise gun was fired
that the -three battalions forming the
regiment were once more together on
the pier.
Outside the gates thousands awaited
their coming, as they had day after
day for a week. East street, from Har
rison to Market, was a perfect jam of
men and gayly dressed women and chil
dren. The chill in the air and the
murky fog could not deter them from
the very first glimpse obtainable of the
heroes come home. Up Market street
as far' as the eye could reach, out
Golden Gate to Van Ness and up Van
Ness, blocks and blocks beyond the re
viewing stand, humanity was packed
as closely as possible, all along the line
of march. Not an available footing was
to be had half an hour after the march
was taken up; not a window that was
unoccupied; no perch whereon one
small could perch with saftey that
did 'not held two; roofs were crowded,
â¢cornices were pre-empted, balconies
were filled/, and still tliere were those in
the crowds unplaced. Express and de
livery wagons were drawn on side
streets to be temporary grand stands
for the curious, ladders were pressed
Into service in doorways, and, in at
least one instance, on the . sidewalk, as
perches for birds of girls. ':â 'â >. 'â 
Almost as great as the waiting
crowds was the profusion of decora
tion. Flags, flags,, flags, where,
a foggy firmament studded with in
numerable stars and stripes. From
curb to cupola .they flew jauntily
as if possessed of the spirit of
the occasion. In the double line
of the welcoming throng from the
ferries to the Presidio gate every, other
man or woman or child Held a flag or
a spotless handkerchief to . heighten
the, color effect, and, when . the. time
came, waved .a welcome .to^ the pass.r-s'
boys ;in brown. '.}, Flowers were carried
in profusion," lending their perfumes
and adding their beauty to! the grand
ensemble of the San Francisco girl.
Many were heard to. remark that
not even at the recent Fourth of
July parade had such a myriad of peo
ple gathered on the streets. It looked
that way and it was remarkable when
one considers the early hour, the pene
trating fog and the chill breeze. It
was not very remarkable, however,
when one comes ; to cr "sider the San
Francisco character. Time and time
again have the people of ..this city ,
demonstrated ' their patriotism and
shown the spontaneity . with : which. they |
honor demands upon. it. Say the word
and it's not always necessary even to
do thatâand the town is ablaze. Flags
fly at a second's notice, bunting is
draped and banners strung; bands play,
whistles'" '- scream;- i_Annoni /b00n.. -bells;
clang, fires are lighted and r. celebra
tion of immense proportions is in full
swing before one knows it. That is
San Francisco's way of doing things
and that is the way she did it yester
day for the Oregon boysâ only more so.
Early or late, rain or shine, the city is
always readyâ sometimes the proces
sions are not.
Not so yesterday. As anxious as
were the patriotic crowds to . receive
them the Oregon volunteers were eager

and .Troop F, Sixth United States

rode out from the transport dock. As
he did so a loud "Forward., march!"
was heard. The Call . cannon ; in the
tower of the Claus Spreckels building
boomed forth the signal, and the vol
unteers were, again, on American soil.
The. re-entry of Colonel , Summers
and his men was greeted with the
loudest, -strongest, longest shout that
ever went up in San Francisco. Al
most simultaneously it seemed .- to
burst from the throats of the tens and
tens of thousands waiting to do honor
to the incoming heroes. At the same
time bands . stationed all along the
street, as if imbued with the same idea,
struck up that stirring air, "When
Johnny Comes Marching Home."
Gongs sounded, fish-horns tooted, cow
bells and _ car-bells clanged, revolvers
were shot in air, bombs exploded, and
crackers were '.touched off. The. line
was formed, the artillery band started
up a lively march, and the triumphant
journey was commenced.

"Here they come!" "Here they
come!" was repeated from the ferries
in a semicircle to North Beach and the
waiting crowd, too far up the street for
a 'first glimpse of the procession,
swayed out on the pavements to get it.
The police charged them, none doing
nobler work titan Sergeant Michael
Joseph Conboj , who makes the most
threatening descents and ends up with
the gentlest laying on of hands on a
holiday crowd of "army man an th*
foorce." Again and again The Call can
non boomed out a welcome to the ad
vancing regiment, the mingled din of
bells and horns, exploding bombs and
thrilling cheers became something in
describable.
The advance had reached the junc
tion of Third, Market and Kearny
streets when the pandemonium reached
its height. One could not hear most of
the noises for some of the others. They
were not for the drum major, nor for
Chief Lees in his motorless buggy, but
for Colonel Summers and his heroic
men. The commanding figure at the
head of the regiment looked like that
of a demi-god as it sat the spirited bay
charger. A campaign hat sat jauntily
on a thatch of silver gray surmounting
a clear-cut face. The trim-fitting uni
form of kharki perfectly fitted the
figure, showed to advantage its grace.
Certainly the Oregon Regiment should
be proud of its handsome chief. He
looked the ideal soldier.
Cheered and cheered again all
along the street. Colonel Summers
was compelled many times to raise
his hat and salute the crowd. In
front of The Call office a gray
haired man rushed out and pre
sented the hero of Maasin with a beau
tiful bouquet of blood red carnations.
The colonel shook the donor's hand
arid while The Call band played a
quickstep the first battalion of the Ore
gonians passed to a position in front of
the office and halted. . -
The cannon boomed from the. cupola
at regular intervals, punctuating with
its deep- toned roar the "deafening
"Pop," "pop," "pop," of innumerable
firecrackers from the Examiner build
ing. The first lot were touched off as
the head of the regiment passed, and
the last had not stopped cracking till
the parade had gone on and was dis
appearing from view up Market street,
the crowd closing up behind.
The men of the regiment showed
plainly in their marching that they were
suffering from the long imprisonment
in the transports. The stiffness was
not yet out of their limbs, and the
slight chill in the air was cold to them
coming as they did from the burning
suns of the Philippines. Aside from a
little halt in the step of a man or two
in the line, and the sight of the ambu
lance following with the convalescing
wounded, one might not have thought
that the volunteers had been under se
vere fire. The ambulance told the tale,
however, and the rear ranks of several
companies showed where those once
belonged who rest beneath the sod.
The survivors, however, looked every

themselves, arid at â  every step on the,

put flowers in their belts and on their
guns, and yelled friendly greetings, de
spite all the policemen could do. And
the soldiers smiled and shook hands
and looked â which was all very
unsoldierlike, but very natural under
the circumstances. .
On Golden Gate and Van Ness ave
nues, away from the business portion
of town, the best of all receptions
awaited the boys, and must have given
pain to the dandy troopers arid stolid
artillerists of the escort left out of the
calculation. The girls fairly swarmed
on the sun-browned volunteers at
every stop. There were smacks that
sounded like sweet music, little giggles
and hasty scampers as the patriotic
dears some of them, it must be told,
old enough to do all their kissing at
horne â made osculatory sallies and
hasty retreats.
While these pleasant passages on the {
journey were being recorded Major j
General Shafter and his staff, who had !
ridden from Black Point, took up their ;
stand on Van Ness avenue at Bush
street. With the commanding general
of the department were Colonel W. H.
Forwood, Lieutenant Colonel J. B.
Babcock, Lieutenant Colonel J. M. Mar
shall, Lieutenant Colonel M. P. Maus,
Major R. H. Noble, Major S. W. Groes-.
beck. Major H. Gallagher, Major
George F. Downey, Major D. F. Ray,
Major H. L. Rees and Captain Frank
Green. Brigadier General Warfield. N.
G. C, in civilian clothes, was also at
the stand. .
The avenue, as it always does, pre
sented a beautiful appearance. Por
tions of all the downtown crowds had
moved up to join everybody and his or
her friends in their windows, on the
steps and sidewalks and in their trees.
The decorations were beautiful and
profuse. Pacific street was elbowing
the south of Market on the common
ground of patriotism and doing its best
to go it one better in the way of out
burst. Each rivaled the other In its
shoutings as the head of the line came
in view and they kept at it till the last
man had disappeared over the hill.
It was 10 o'clock before the strains of
"When Johnny Comes Marching
Home" floated over the housetops. Gen
eral Shafter took a tug at his belt and
straightened up after the style
in which he used to , ride the Texas
plains and prepared to cast his prac
ticed eye over the column. In a few
moments the carriages containing Gov
ernor Geer and his party drove up in
front of the commanding general, who
saluted bareheaded, the Oregon execu
tive baring his bead in return.
The carriages of the gubernatorial
party took up positions on Bush street
above the avenue just as the head of
the Oregon regiment reached the stand.
There was an added, burst of cheering
to that he and his men had been given
on the way when Colonel Summers sa
luted and rode on. ;
Company after company, with arms
at port, the men of Oregon passed the
reviewing officer, who was loudly
cheered as he saluted the colors. On
and on they passed and with them their
escort, until the last rattle of artillery
wagons was lost in the distance, the
first step in the public reception of the
Oregonians ending where the Presidio
began.

panies been assigned their quarters
when the visitors began to flock in and
pay their respects to officers and pri
vates alike. Lunch was the first vari
ation in the day's camp life and
it was eaten in the regiment's
mess quarters. The hospitable re
ception of San Francisco had put
the men in good spirits and a gen
eral freedom of action was allowed to
all. Late in the afternoon the camp
took on the appearance of the old days,
with soldiers gathered in groups on the
sands, crowds of visitors blocking the
approaches to the tents.
Much concern was felt by the officers
of the regiment on account of the
weather. A heavy, gusty wind tore
holes in the sand and made it extreme
ly disagreeable for a first day in camp.
A thick fog rolled in from the straits
at the same time and the canvas-cos
tumed soldiers just returned from the
tropics sought warmth in heavy mili
tary top-coats. The threatening ele
ments, however, could not dampen
their soldier enthusiasm over the pros
pect of a two weeks' stay in San Fran
cisco. They shivered and they shook,
but all seemed happy.
At 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon a gen
eral assembly of the regiment in the
west end of the parade grounds was or
dered by Colonel Summers for the
purpose of presenting Governor Geer to
the regiment. The men were summoned
by the blast of a trumpet, formed into
companies and marched unarmed to
the place of concentration.
Governor Geer, attended by his staff,
took his stand in the front of the regi
ment close to Colonel Summers. The
commanding officer, after a few words
of cordial thanks to the people of San
Francisco for the glowing reception ac
corded his fighters, introduced the Gov
ernor.
"On account of the extreme unpleas
antness of the weather," said the Gov
ernor, "I will not keep you here long.
All I wish to say to each and every one
of you boys of Oregon is 'God bless
you.' We have had a most royal recep
tion at the hands of California, but
there is one unpleasant feature that
mars your return. It is that you are
to be mustered out on the soil of Cali
fornia and not in Oregon.
"I and my staff came down especially
to receive you, thinking that you would
remain here but a day or two and then
; return to your native State. I was sur
prised to learn that it was the desire of
the regiment to be mustered out in San
Francisco, and I did all to secure the
fulfillment of your wishes. I thank the
people "of California ' for all they have
done for you, hut this reception would
only be a shadow compared to that
which Oregon will give you If you re
turn as a regiment. From the valleys
and the mountains the people of your
State, upon which you* have conferred
great renown, - will flock together to
welcome her warrior sons. ;, : â¢
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 15. 1899.
"Before I leave I want you to assure
the people of Oregon that you will re
turn to the State in which you enlist
ed and ' give them the coveted oppor
tunity to receive you as a body of
which they are proud."
Colonel Summers then gaVe the or
der "at rest" and the Governor asked
all those who would return to Oregon
to raise their ritrht hand. Most of the
regiment complied, but one or two in
each company had tasted the pleasures
of metropolitan life and their arms
were unraised.
The regiment was then dismissed
and the soldiers rushed pell-mell to
the cars, which carried them to a din
ner at Mechanics' Pavilion.
Free transportation to the Pavilion
for the soldiers had been furnished by
the Market-street Railway Company,
the California-street and the . Presidio
and Ferries" Companies. . Manager Yin-
ing put on ten extra cars on the Jack
son and Powell-street lines of the Mar
ket-street Railway and gave the use
of ten more free of all charge, in addi
tion to furnishing 100 free tickets for
the soldier boys. Five hundred free
tickets were supplied by the Califor

the Presidio and Ferries, making more
than enough for all needs. The com

manner in which their roads handled

SOLDIERS AT
THE PAVILION
For nearly two hours, last night Me
chanics' Pavilion resounded with ' the" al
ternating cheers ".of soldiers and ; civilians
and the crash of patriotic -music poured
forth In an almost incessant stream by a
brass band of extraordinary endurance.
.In the arrangement of the feast, the
ladles of the Red Cross did splendid work,
and throughout the evening they circu
lated among the boys, seeing to their
every want.
The tables at the head of the .Pavilion
had been reserved for the dignitaries, in
cluding Governors Gage and Geer. The
committee sent a telegram of Invitation
to Governor Gage at San Diego asking
him to be present or name a representa
tive. It received no reply, other than
that the Governor had left San Diego be
fore the message reached that place.
During the course of the evening Adju
tant General Seamans privately . an
nounced that he was there to represent
the Executive.
In the case of Governor Geer, his ab
sence, he explained later, was due to his
lack, of knowledge of the whereabouts
of the Pavilion and the fact that, if it
had been sent, he had received no invi
tation from the committee other than the
notices he had seen in the newspapers. j
Colonel Summers had about a' thousand
men at tsfble. but. with the other invited
guests, including the members of the First

Major General Shafter was there, ac

GHOST OF OVER-EDUCATION
NOW and then in these days some successful business man raises his eyes from his counter to question the
American university's right to exist. "Does higher education pay?" he asks, and from his own experience
of tireless energy and from his own contact with the thin-legged, white-faced collegians seeking a job j he
gives to this question a qualified negative. He further claims, should he care to pursue the subject at
greater length, that opportunities for higher education are too widely diffused and that the American
masses are victims of "over-education." .
If all this is true It is time to call a halt and take account of stock. We have invested too much in univer
sities, love and devotion as well as bonds and gold, for us to be indifferent to their usefulness.
It Is certain that to speak of "over-education" is a misuse of terms. If education Is rational and effective
there cannot be too much of it. It is not men trained and efficient who enter into destructive competition. It is
the ignorant and ineffective who make the struggle for existence so dire a battle. Whatever leaves men weak
and ineffective cannot justly be called education. There is nothing more useful than wisdom, nothing more ef
fective than training, nothing more practical than sunshine.
Surely no one can claim that the American people are too wise, too skillful or too enlightened for their' own
good. Yet to give wisdom, skill and enlightenment is the main function of higher education. Not all the critics
in business life taken together have done one-tenth as much to make education practical as has one of the great
university presidents of our time.â Extract from the address of David Starr Jordan in answer to the ; charge of

LOS ANGELES, July With the
closing of the doors at Hazard's
Pavilion at 10 o'clock to-night the
thirty-eighth session of the National
.Educational Association Convention passed
Into history. Dr. Irwin Shepard, secretary
of the association, to-night gave to The
Call correspondent the following official
estimate of the work accomplished during
the Los Angeles meeting:
From every point of view this has been the
record-breaking convention. The most gratify
ing feature has been the attendance. There
hava come to the Los Angeles meeting 15,000
persons. Up to noon to-day over 10,000 mem
bership certificates have been issued, and the
end is not yet, as 600 persons to-day arrived
from various sections. These are all attracted
by tbe low rates and have been belated from
many causes.
When it was decided that the convention
should come to Los Angeles the California com
mittee guaranteed the association 5000 member
ships. The committee has succeeded in pro
viding a little in excess of 3500, which is a
large increase over the California membership
secured in lass.
The income to the association from this meet
ing will exceed $25,000. This means thai we
will be able to transfer about $10,000 to the
general fund, and that sum added to the $.4,000
now on hand, will land our assets quite near
the $100,000 mark.
I am to-day preparing data for the principal
report that will record the proceedings of th__Â»
convention. This official document will be
printed by the University Press of Chicago,
issued on December 1, and will comprise about
1100 pages bound in black cloth, The reporta
of committees and officers, together with many
advance addresses, are now in type. A copy
â will be sent to every active and life member,
one to every associate member that sends 'In
his name before September 1, 1599.
These proceedings will be thoroughly indexed
and are now indispensable adjuncts of every
library that seeks to serve the interests of edu
cation or to assist the work of teachers in the
common school.
Since the Denver meeting there has been an
entire reorganization of the constitution and
policy of the National Educational Association.
This movement was inaugurated at that meet
ing, under the presidency of Dr. Nicholas Mur
ray Butler, by the establishment of two classes
of membership, viz., the active membership,
â¢which is made up of teachers in active ser
vice, and which is permanent, and the asso
ciate membership, which may be held by any
one who pays the annual membership fee. Both
classes of membership are alike entitled to a
volume of the proceedings, but the active mem
bers receive other publications and all T-ulletins :
of information issued by the association. I
The ticket agents, who have been kept !
busy stamping tickets, are enjoying a
needed rest. Up to last evening they nad j
stamped 7000 National Educational Asso
ciation tickets. Of that number TOO were
handled yesterday and 1000 the day before.
The tickets yet unstamped will come in
later, a few at a time or singly, until Sep
tember 4. The total number of tickets
that require the stamping and signing
probably will reach 7500. That represents
only the number of travelers from a dis
tance and does not include those from
Southern California points.
The executive officers of the National
Educational Association will return to
the East over the Northern Pacific
route. In the party will be Ex-
President (now First Vice President) j
E. O. Lyte, James M. Greenwood, I. C.
McNeil, Dr. Irwin Shepard, A. G. Lane,
Dr. Nicholas Murray, N. C. Dougherty,
F. Louis Soldan, Dr. A. R. Taylor and
ethers.
Among the San Franciscans who are
now here are:-R. H. Webster, the Super
intendent of Schools: Mrs. C. N. Mark,
Misses A. G. Kelly, S. N. Wilson, Emma
Onyon. Anna Onyon, Lottie Bean. E.
Carpenter, K. M. Ball, W. McDon
ald. Norah Dwyer, Judge N. Cooney,
Judge D. C. Denson; Messrs. H. V. W.
Dinkelspiel, W. W. Stone, T. McCarthy,
. W. A. Edwards, C. C. Young, J. Clark and
Dr. Frederick Burk. The San Francisco
delegation has enjoyed many outings. It
lias visited Santa Barbara, Santa Monica,
Coronado, Mount Lowe, Catalina and
other points.
Among the larger Eastern delegations
have been the Pennsylvanians, over 800
persons; the Indianans, 227 delegates; the
Coloradans, 200 strong; the Illinolsans,
750, and the Ohioans and New Yorkers, 400
each. The Hawaiian Islands sent a dele
gation of twelve teachers.
Despite the fact that this was the clos
ing day of the convention â¢ about 600 per
sons arrived on the morning trains. The
Southern Pacific brought in two sections
at 7 o'clock this morning and the Santa
Fe two sections at 8:20. Up to 11 o'clock
this morning about 350 teachers had regis
tered at the Spring-street headquarters.
Many of those that arrived to-day are not
teachers, but pleasure seekers who wish
to take advantage of the many excursions
and entertainments which follow the con
vention. Most of the arrivals to-day are
from this State and Arizona, Among the
Arizonans is Governor Murphy.
Althoug* this was the fourth day of
the distribution of tickets to the Chinese
Theater for next Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday afternoon and evening to
members of the National Educational As
sociation, the demand continues to be as
large as at the beginning. Commencing
to-morrow the hangings and decorations
to be used in the interior of the pavilion
will be placed by Chinese residents of the
city. After the concert to-morrow night
the work of placing the stage settings
will be taken up and the decorations of
the interior of the big hall will be com
pleted. Aside from the decorations, which
will be rich and of a character never be
fore attempted in this city, and the cos
tumes of the actors, the perfection of Ori
ental grandeur, other features will be the
bazaar, the tea garden and promenade.
The local Chinese regard, the National
Educational Association Convention as a
great occasion, and they have appointed
committees from their various tongs, or
societies, to meet the actors on Sunday
morning and escort them up town with
bands.
The Southern Pacific equipment is being
taxed to take the large crowds out of
Los Angeles. Sleeper reservations in the
owl; have been sold up to July 18, while
thirty-six Pullman cars are scheduled to
leave here for the north within the next
five days. Thirteen sleepers jammed full
went out to-day. All steamer accommo
dations from Los Angeles to San Fran
cisco are said to be sold to August 27.
Upward of 500 voices will be heard In
the choral concert to be given in Hazard's
Pavilion and Simpson Tabernacle to-mor
row night ln honor of the visiting Na
tional Educational Association delegates.
Santa Barbara will entertain the visit
ors on July 19 and 20â Wednesday and
Thursday. The Chamber of Commerce
has arranged two days' entertainment,
the first to be known as "Mission day.'
at which time the Friars will entertain
the visitors; the second to be known as
"Santa Barbara day." Part of the enter
tainment of this day will be "land and
channel sports," a drive about the city
and yacht races. _.'__,__
At- Santa Ana on July 17 there will be
a free drive and luncheon.- At Pomona
for July 19 the citizens have appointed a
cpecial committee to arrange for a drive,
a visit to the orange groves. and luncheon.
San Diego will entertain the delegates
on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, July 21,
22 and 23. This will Include a. trip to Tia
Juana in Lower California, to see the In
dians and witness feats of horsemanship,
to patronize the bazaar and listen to mu
sic by darkrskinned senorita?. also rides
! on the bay and excursions to Point Coro
' nado and the celebrated lemon groves.
To-morrow a special excursion to San
Fernando Mission will be run, leaving at
1 and returning at 6:30. The visitors will
be under the care of the Landmarks
j Club, that has done much to restore and
maintain the old missions in this section.
The Turn Verein Germanla gave a gym
nastic entertainment this evening at Turn
i Verein Hall on Main street, between
! Third and Fourth. An exhibition was
given of all classes in athletics.
California day at the Van Nuys was
attended by large crowds to-day, Oak
land, Stockton and San Jose teachers be
ing most in evidence of the delegates
i here from the north. San Diego was on
hand doing the honors for the country
! south of Tehachapi. The Los Angeles
I teachers assisted at the reception, but
permitted the delegates from other parts
] of the State to monopolize the attention
iof the Eastern visitors. The Stockton
committee in charge of the reception
I consisted of Susie Forrest, Lucy Harris.
I Blanche Aaron, Emily Wagner, Sella Al-
I drich, Emma Debman, Carrie Whiting.

music was a part of the programme to
night. Several thousand visitors were en
tertained.
The .kindergarten teachers were re
l ceived at the school between 4 and 'j
I o'clock this afternoon.
The Chicago Teachers' Federation still
. exhibits its hustling abilities and is mak
ing a host of friends. The Chicagoans
know their business, and in creating the
propaganda are so well schooled that they
i do not talk themselves out of court.
The committee appointed yesterday to
I discuss preliminary plans for the forma

ho to create conditions in school matters that
shall be most beneficial to school teacher* and j
! officers and its special object shall be to se-
I cure for teachers all of the rights and benefits j
jto which they are entitled. â¢
The citizens have become interested in j
the bustling bevy of schoolma'ams, whllo ,
I the local alliance, 200 strong, has planned i
I a series of i entertainment , that are ;
unique. So well pleased is the statuesque
Catherine Goggln, the president, that she
says it is not possible to state when they j
will return to the East.
CLOSING SESSION OF
THE CONVENTION
President Jordan Answers the At-
tacks Upon So-Called "Over-
Education."
LOS ANGELES. July 14.â The final gen
eral session of the National Educational
Association convention to-day was held
at Hazard's Pavilion. Every delegate
that heretofore had been derelict in at
tending the meetings seemed determined
to make up for former shortcomings. At
the hour of opening the lower floor of the
Pavilion was filled. At the close of the
first paper doors' were thrown open and
teachers swarmed in until it was nec
essary for the ushers to close them be
fore beginning of the next number. Then
many were obliged to wait on the out
side for the opportunity to enter.
The tendency of parents to shift the re
sponsibility of the child's education en
tirely upon the teacher has been depre
cated ln many thoughtful papers that
have been read since the opening of the
National Educational Association. Aaron
Gove, Superintendent of Schools at Den
ver, Colo., pointed out some of the dangers
of this tendency in a forceful and epi
grammatic manner. His delivery was very
effective.
The growth of paternalism, the speaker
urged, reached over to the schools, and
much of the training formerly i. -ne at
home was now relegated to the school.
The severe religious and effective discip
line of the early American home was dis
appearing, and the remedy advocated .was
more time with the teacher. Rather than
idleness at home, ten hours ln school in
stead of six, he urged, and he argued that
the State must assume the new duties
being indicated for self-preservation.
George P. Brown, editor of .School and
Home education, spoke on "Tne Function
of the Educational Press." He said:
The educational press must be the standard
bearer rather than the camp follower of the
educational host if it shall perform its func
tion. It must gather and circulate the material
by which public opinion shall be molded, and _
serve as the herald, at least, of the leaders of '
the educational army. It seeks to publish the
observations, experiences and tentative con
clusions of men and women who write with
varying degrees of consciousness of the transi
tion in educational philosophy and practice that
we are now entering upon. The less conscious
one Is of the philosophy of the movement, the
more valuable, sometimes, la his contribution,
provided he Is sensitive to the new atmosphere.
Those who are not Influenced by it may be good
priests and scribes for recording what is done
under the law, but they are not prophets of
the coming time.
"Are Educational Journals Education
al?" was answered by George William
Bruce, editor of the American School
Board Journal of Milwaukee, Wis. He
said:
Educational . journals are an Important fac
tor, as has been demonstrated here to-day.
They should be strong and fearless, . comba_t
that which Is superficial and misleading, cham
pion that which is worthy, noble, true. In
order to make them so' they must have ade
quate support. It lies In your power to create
a strong educational press, by recognizing only
that which Is worthy, and In permitting the
law of the survival of the fittest to j take its
natural course.
At to-night's session President David
Starr Jordan of Leland Stanford Junior
University delivered an address entitled
"An Apology for the American Universi
ties." He said in part: Â£
Now and then in these days some successful
business man raises his eyes from his counter
to question the American university's eight to
exist. "Does higher education pay?" he asks,
and from his own experience of tireless energy
and from his own contact with the thin-legged,
white-faced collegians seeking a Job, he gives
to this question a qualified negative. He fur
ther claims, shapld he care to pursue the sub
ject at greater length, that opportunities for
higher education are too widely diffused and
that the American masses are victims of over-
education.
If all this Is true. it Is time to call a halt
and take account of stock. We have Invested
too much In universities, love and devotion as
well as bonds and gold, for us to be Indifferent
to their usefulness. â â 
It Is certain that to apeak of "over-educa
tion" Is a misuse of terms. If education Is
rational and effective there cannot be too much
of It. It la not men trained and efficient who
enter Into destructive competition. It Is the
Ignorant and ineffective who make the struggle
for e___t.Qc. Â§- dire a battle. Whatever leave*
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SATITBPAY, JULY 15, 189_Â».
| men weak and Ineffective cannot Justly â¢be
called education. There is nothing more useful
than Wisdom, nothing more effective than
j training, nothing more practical than sunshine.
j Surely no one can claim that the American
people are too wise, too skillful, or too enlight
ened for their own good. " Yet to give wisdom,
skill and enlightenment Is the main function of
higher education. It cannot give brains, cour
age and virtue where these qualities were- want
ing before. It cannot make a man, but it fur-,
nishes the best known means to help a man to
make himself. The gain through self-building
often outweighs in value the original material.
It may be more important even than the fin
ished product, as effort is a greater source of
strength and happiness to a man than final
achievement. What these critics usually mean
to attack is misfit education, the training or
â  strain. ng of the memory rather than the acqui
; sition of power to think and act. They mean
that the colleges give schooling rather than
j training. They "teach young people how to
I talk rather than how to live." This- is still
j true to some extent In some places, but the
whole tendency of the university movement is
j toward reality and practicality. These critics
i have not watched this movement. They do not
\ draw their id. a of a university from the power
i ful, well organized Institutions of the day,
j which lay hold of every various power of
I humanity and seek to draw it Into effective,
; harmonious action. Rather they picture to
I themselves the starvllng colleges of their youth
I where callow boys were driven against their
'] will over racecourses of study, no part of
i which appealed to their own souls or was re
lated in any direct way to their lives. Such
colleges and such ideals of education exist in
our time in certain forgotten corners, but they
are in no sense typical of the American univer
; sity of to-day.
Not all the critics in business life, taken to
gether, have done one-tenth as much to make
education practical as has one of the great
university presidents of our time. Under the
I hands of Eliot and White and Angell and Tap
| pan and other.; like these the whole face of
| higher education in America has changed in
the last twenty years, and the change has been
' in every way toward greater usefulness and
I greater practicality.
The American college of the past was a
feeble Copy of the colleges of England. The
American university of to-day draws Its In
spiration from the deeper, stronger currents
of German scholarship.
To know nature, life, art, one must go out
-1 side the tripos of three sacred pedestals of
learning â Latin, Greek, mathematicsârecog
nized by the conventional college. To the uni
versity of Germany he may go, or to the uni
versity of America, and in these institutions of
reality every man in search of wisdom or
power will find his efforts strengthened, his
success hastened. The ideal of the American
university of to-day is expressed in the words,
constructive Individuality. It would build up
scholarship and character, but always on the
basis of the powers which nature gave the in
dividual. It Is no abstract or ideal man with
which it deals, but real men. Just a* they. are.
the Individual as created â no two alike, each
with his own divine gift of personality, which
separates the man that is from all the men
that are or were or ever will be.
The college of the past dealt chiefly with rec
ords and tradition. It sought no new truth
and coveted no action. The college life was
a period of restful growth, to be cherished for
its fragrant memories. It was not a time of
forceful struggle, for heightened power and
deeper wisdom.
The university of to-day is alert to all the
problems of social and political development.
The poorhouse, the Jail, the caucus, the Legis
lature, the army, the discordant demands of
freedom and orderâ all these call for closest
attention of the university student. ,
What the university can do Is along manly
lines. It can cure the boy of petty vices and
childish trickery by making him a man, by
giving him higher ideals, more serious views
of life. It may win by .inspiration, not by fear.
It must strengthen the student In his search
for truth. It must encourage manliness In him
through putting away of childish things. Let
the thoughts of the student be free as air. Let
him prove all things and he will hold fast to
that which Is good. Give him a message to
speak to others, awd when he leaves the uni
versity you need fear for him not the world,
nor the flesh, nor the devil.
The universities of America have grown enor- '
mously in wealth and power within the last
twenty-five years. The next twenty-five years
will tell the same story. They have the confi
dence of the people because they deserve their
confidence, and the good citizen of the republic
must give them trust and support. For It is in
the university at last the history of democracy
must be written.
Hon. Nathan C. Schaefer, State Superin
tendent of Public Instruction of Pennsyl
vania, delivered an address on "The
School in Its Relation to the Higher Life."
Albert E. Winship of Boston made a short
address on "A Professional Spirit a-. In
fluence," and then Dr. Nicholas Murray
Butler, as chairman of the committee on
resolutions, made the report.
After reaffirming the belief that educa
tional Ideals are firmly established,
school and college education more widely
diffused and the Work of teaching morÂ»
intelligent and successful, the report went
on to say that "the one dark page in the
history of the year is that which records
interference with the work of public edu
cation and attacks, successful and unsuc
cessful, made upon It by political traitors
and spoil-seekers. We appeal to the pub
lic and to the press to resist, to resent
and to punish these attacks, and we
pledge pur best efforts to the absolutely
non-political and non-sectarian conduct of
the work intrusted to us."
The report having been received and the
resolutions adopted, O. T. Corson of Co
lumbus, Ohio, was presented to the im
mense gathering, and. after he had said a
few words the audience arose and joined
in singing "America" and the convention
was at an end.
The department of normal schools had
a â  very interesting closing session this
afternoon, when several papers were read
and discussed. Perhaps the one most
provocative of thought was that read by
Miss H. Scott of Detroit on "The Quali
fications of a Critic Teacher." Miss M
Brown of New Orleans spoke on "Lesson
Plans," and Miss G. Edmund, Ph. D. of
Lowell, Mass., and Professor C. E Van
Llew of Los Angeles led in the discus
sion on the subject of "Observation as a
Factor In Training School Work."
A paper that appealed strongly to
parents as well as to teachers was read
in the elementary department by Super
intendent J. . W. Dinsmore of Beatrice,
Neb., on the subject of "Vices of Child
hood and Youth."- Only those that are
criminal or distinctly responsible for a
large percentage of crime were dealt
with, and deceit was pointed out as the
first to appear, it being practiced at less
than two years. / Illustrations were given
of the mother unknowingly instilling Into
the. childish mind a vicious habit by ef
fusively greeting a caller .whom the child
knows is unwelcome, or apologizing for a
state of things which Is quite the usual
order. Lying, stealing, gambling, vulgar
ity and impurity .were dilated upon each
in turn, and how to prevent, remedy arid
eradicate the abounding evil were spoken
of as the - problems . that - should arouse
interest in every friend of humanity.

overestimated. - â¢â¢ - - â¢
Department officials confirm the
statement obtained from another offi
cial source yesterday, that if there be
no agreement on a provisional line the
United States will be free to send
troops to garrison Pyramid harbor.
Lord Salisbury knows that if a fail
| ure to agree be brought about by Can
l ada the immediate consequence will be
\ that the United States must send a
! large force of troops to the frontier. It
! is this fact which, in the opinion of
I State Department officials, offers some
ground for the belief that England will
now endeavor to reopen the case.
The State Department expects ln a
day or two a full statement from Em
bassador Choate of the negotiations
between himself and Lord Salisbury in
relation to the Alaskan provisional
boundary line. This statement will be
followed shortly by a report from Sen
ator Fairbanks of his observations in
the disputed territory.
TRANSPORTS ARE
IN DEMAND TO
CARRY HORSES
Coll Siam Taken by
Uncle Sam.
. â Â« â
Uncle Sam Is to continue sending horses
to Manila. The ship Taeoma came off the
drydock yesterday and will sail for the
Philippines just as soon as' the supplies
and animals can be put aboard. She. will
be followed about the end of the month
by the big collier Siam, and probably the
Washtenaw or one of the other steamers
now running to British Columbia. There
are plenty of vesels now in service to car
ry the troops, but nearly 1500 horses are
wanted in Manila before the spring opens,
and the quartermaster is going to try and
get them there.
The Siam is under charter to John Ros
enfeld's Sons and will make another trip
to Nanaimo, B. C, for that firm. After
that she will be turned over to the Gov
ernment and will carry supplies and
horses for six months. She is a large ves
sel of 3160 tons gross burden and carries
4200 tons of coal. She ought therefore to
carry 3500 tons of supplies and about 200
horses on her first voyage to Manila. The
Conemaugh and Wyefield will get quick
dispatch at the other end and will come
beck here direct to take down another load
before the spring opens. These vessels,
with the Taeoma, Siam and Washtenaw,
should have no trouble in supplying Gen
eral Otis with all the horses he wants
within the time specified.
The new steam launch Magic was turned
over to the quartermaster's department by
the builders yesterday. She was built for
the San Diego service, but there is so
much work for the McDowell since the
war began that the Magic will be kept
here to assist. her. While the McDowell
is carrying soldiers and . freight between
the transports and the various army posts
the Magic will run between San Francis
co Alcatraz, Angel Island and the Pre
sidio, carrying passengers. She will also
be used by the army doctor in boarding
the transports when they come into port.
The Magic was built by the Fulton Iron
Works and is a good eleven-knot boat. She
Is sixty feet long and has good accom
modations for passengers. She Is com
manded by Captain James Turner. _
The following vessels arrived at St.
Michael prior to July 1: Sarpnne, Bertha,
Lakme, Ellhu Thomson, Portland Na
tional City, Homer, Samoa and Bruns
wick; bark Oregon, schooners .Vega, J M.
Colman and Ethel Zane; brig Courtney
Ford and the Norwegian steamer Bow
head. The latter vessel has been pur
chased by Captain Cook, late of the Bel
vedere, and is on her way to the Arctic.
The others are all members of the Klon
dike fleet . . __ .â ,_ .
The bark Roderick Dhu will sail for
Hilo to-day i with over twenty passengers
and a large cargo, Including eighty-six
mules and one horse. Among the passen
gers are E. Hitchcock, Mr. and Mrs. C.
H Brown and the Misses Eaton, who are
returning to Hllo after a vacation in Cal
ifornia and Mr. and Mrs. McCaslan, who
are going to the Islands on a pleasure
The surveyors who have examined the
wreck of the British ship City of York
advise that the hull and cargo be sold at
once She Is in shallow water, and neither
tug nor lighter can get near her. Should
another storm come up the ship will go
to pieces. The story of the wreck of the
City of York and the drowning of Captain
Jones and eleven of his crew was told

AUTOMOBILE BROKEN,
BUT COMING ALONG
A. Day of Accidents Winds Up at Poughkeepsie
With Crowds Cheering John D. Davis
and His Wife.
POUGHKEEPSIE, N. V., July 14.â
"We've had hard luck to-day,
boys," said John D. Davis, as his
automobile rolled up to' the curb
in front of the Nelson House, on
Market street, .in this city, at 7:45 this
evening. Mrs. Davis. smiled graciously
at the crowd of over 200 representative
citizens who had been waiting for hours
for the continental voyagers to arrive.
Mr. and Mrs. Davis left; Tarrytown
at ; 5 o'clock this morning, . and before
progressing . far accidents began to
overtake them. Within a few miles of
Peekskill the . rear, cylinder .broke â¢ and
just outside of the town some delay
was had in trying to fix it. . They
reached Peekskill; Station at 8:40, and
from there went up to the town proper
In order to get the cylinder repaired. It
was then discovered that. a link in. the
crank shaft had also broken, rendering
one of the clutches useless. Three hours
were spent in repairing this. A steel
wire was the only implement obtain
able in Peekskill with which the broken
cylinder, could .. ln part be : repaired and
the escape stopped. .
It was 12:20 when the carriage rolled
out of Peekskill, followed by a large
crowd of â¢ people, who were curious to
see how the carriage would fare ,on
Nelson Hill, on which hill every auto
mobilist who has yet tried it has failed
to get to the top In his carriage. The
hill has 30 per cent grade. Mr. and Mrs.
Davis took their carriage successfully
up Nelson Hill with one cylinder and
only part of the power of the other.

INGTON, July 14.â advices
reached the State Department
to-day respecting the reported
purpose of the Berlin Government to
send the German : cruiser Geler to
Guatemala. Acting under instruc
tions from Washington. Minister Hun
ter is carefully watching the situation.
Before the demonstration occurs it is
expected that the United States will be
Informed of it, and of the purpose of
Germany's and England's Govern
ments, and the extent to which the
commanding officers of - the warships
will be authorized to go. â '.. : r__....:
It Is said by high officials of the ad
ministration that the trouble is some
what different from those in which the
other Central American states are in
volved, as the investors in Guatemalan
bonds bought them at a low price with
the understanding that they would re
ceive a high rate of interest, these ad
vantages being regarded as compen
satory for the risk taken.
Provided there is no violation of the
Monroe doctrine, 1 the United States, it
is said, will not make any objection to
the proposed demonstration. It is un
derstood that as soon as the authori
ties are advised of the practical condi
tions existing in Guatemala warships

W. F. Russell of Syracuse, Nebr., started for the Grand Canyon to look at Â£
some valuable mining properties. Arriving at the canyon, at the foot of 88
what is known as the Bright Angel trail, they launched a small canvas boat 0
on Sunday afternoon, intending to cross the Colorado River in this cockle- 8?
shell. . â  O
T. A. Fleming and Russell got into the boat, pushing along the steep. Â«_?
rocky wall of the canyon. Suddenly the boat capsized, throwing both Into 8
the river. Fleming, who Is a good swimmer, succeeded after a desperate
struggle ln reaching the bank. Russell, who could not swim, clung desper- ft
ately to the boat. When last seen he was still clinging to the boat, now A
moving down through the terrible rapids in the powerful, resistless current. 88
To-day XV. XV. Bass, an experienced Grand Canyon guide on the Ash 0
Fork trail, started for the canyon In company with another man to make 88
a thorough search of the canyon on both sides of the river In the hope of find- 0
ing Russell. Bass, who knows the canyon for miles on both sides of the river, 85
has had experience with lost people of the canyon before and thinks Russell 0
may have succeeded in reaching the banks. But Russell, being unfamiliar 88
with the country, could never find his way out of those terrible walls un- 0
aided. There Is danger of him dying of starvation, but he could subsist on $8
amola fruit, prickly pear and a kind of chokeberry. which grows very 0
abundantly there. ____
Word yas telephoned to the river north of Kingman to keep a sharp 0
lookout for Russell's body. Every effort will be made to find him or his body, g
Russell has a father, mother and sister in Syracuse, Nebr. ft

PRESIDENT COATES^ON -
UNIONS AND STRIKES
Two Sides of the Smelter Strike Be
fore the Industrial
Commission. . .
DENVER, July 14.â David C. Coates,
president of the State Federation of
Labor, appeared as a witness to-day be
fore the sub-commission on mining of
the United States Industrial Commission.
He said he had known many instances
in which men had been discharged from
service because employers discovered that
they had become members of unions.
Moral suasion was the only force used to
bring recalcitrants into unions. The im
portation of laborers to take the places
of strikers had been detrimental to the
interests of the State. Mr. Coates said
good always resulted from arbitration,
but was not prepared to say whether or
not be favored compulsory arbitration.
The issuance of injunctions he regarded
as a means of depriving the laboring man
of the last vestige of his liberty.
The only remedy for strikes, he be
lieved, was a complete change from the
competitive to the co-operative system.
The smelter strike, Mr. Coates declared,
was brought bout through an attempt
on the part of the American Smelting
and Refining Company to rob the labor
ing classes of the benefits of the eight
hour law. "The general public will not
be benefited by tRe operations of the
smelter trust," he said In answer to a
question.
The witness said he had very little faith
In laws for the protection of labor unless
they are backed up by organization, and
in his opinion, desired results can be ob
tained better when there is no law on the
subject.
David C. Beaman, secretary and general
attorney of the Colorado Fuel and iron
Company, was before the commission
this afternoon. Mr. Beaman expressed
himself as opposed to an eight-hour law.
He defended the scrip system of payment
of employes, and in regard to the impor
tation of negro laborers to work in the
mines and plants of the company Mr.
Seaman declared that the men were Im
ported because local labor was unobtain
ble and that the colored men had proved
more, satisfactory than whites In the class
of work In which they are engaged.
Tie said he was not In favor of labor
unions, but thought if they are permitted
to exist they should be regularly incor
porated, so as to be prevented from shirk
ing legal responsibilities.
Given away with each cash want adver.
tisement ordered in next Sunday's Call, a

A TRACEDY OF
ARCTIC WILDS
J. H. Bird Murders Two
Companions.
â â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. MICHAEL. Alaska, June 30, via
Seattle, Wash.. July 14. âJ. Homer Bird
of New Orleans Is now a prisoner In the
military barracks charged with the mur
der of J. H. Herllng and R. H. Patterson.
Charles Shetller and a woman named
Noma Strong are held under $5000 bonds
as witnesses. The entire party came from
New Orleans. The prisoner and wit
nesses will be taken to Sitka for trial.
From Wallace H. Blame, engineer of
the government launch Nordtca, who ar
rested Bird, particulars of the murder
are learned. The party of five arrived in
St. Michael last summer in the bark
Rufus Wood, which cleared from San
Francisco. They had a full outfit, in
cluding a steam launch and a barge, In
which they made the trip up the river.
The woman went as Bird's wife and
Shefller's sister. At a coal mine about
eighty-five miles this side of AnviK It
was decided to remain for the winter,
Herling and Patterson, after everything
about the place was in shape, proposed
to Bird that a division of the supplies
be made, as they wished to earn money
by cutting wood for use by the trans
portation companies. Bird strongly ob
jected and said he would "see them in
hell first."
A general quarrel ensued, in which
Shefller supported the other two. This
quarrel, aided by jealousy, came to a
climax the following morning, September
27, at breakfast time. The woman had
prepared the meal and was serving it.
Bird was sitting on a bank a short dis
tance above, overlooking the others, who
were seated at a table. The woman asked
him if he was not coming to breakfast.
He said he would in a short time, as he
was not feeling extra well. Just as the
meal began the woman heard a click,
and, looking up, saw Bird with a shotgun
in his hands. At this time Shefller looked
up and, noticing the gun up to Bird's
shoulder, exclaimed: "For God's sake,
don't shoot me." Then a report rang
out and Herllnger fell dead. An instant
later another report n .as heard, the
charge striking Patterson about the neck

Patterson jumped into the river, and
as he came up Bird fired at him again,
but missed. The wounded man managed
to crawl to the bank and a little later
was helped Into the boat by Shefller and
the woman, who had escaped Bird's
wrath. Herling was burled near by and
Patterson cared for as well as conditions
would permit until he died. Â» â¢
So terrified were __l.e_.les and the woman
at Bird that not a word was said con
cerning the shooting for several months.
Finally the coal miners and .woodcutters
began to wonder what had become of the
other two men. They began an investi
gation, which resulted in the arrest of
Bird. Bird swears there was a conspiracy
among the others to do him up, but he
fooled them and dropped them first.

Gold.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, July 14.â The steamer Al
liance arrived this morning from St.
Michael. She is the first vessel to ar
rive from the mouth of the Yukon this
season, and brings advices from the
newly discovered gold field of Cape
Nome. When the Alliance left St.
Michael the season was not far enough
advanced to determine the future of the
digging-. Prospectors were confident
that the country would prove very rich.
Colors were found almost everywhere
throughout the zone, which is t'irty
five miles square, and nearly all the
available ground had been staked. In
some instances there are four or five
claimants to one property. As soon as
warm weather sets in and material for
sluicing is at hand the true value of the
ground will be known.
The Alliance brings news of the
death of several miners near Cape
Nome. The following are the names of
five:
JOE FOUNTAIN.
MAYNARD GItOTEAU.
CAM
DOCTOR BRIGHAM.
JOHN BURKE-
All of these save Burke were from
Holvoke, Mass., and were members of
the party known as the Rich party. Dr.
I. rig ham died from natural causes.
Carr and Burke froze to death. Out
of a party of 100 miners at Cape Nome
eighteen severe cases of scurvy devel
oped during the winter. The stricken
men were loaded on sledges and hauled
over the ico to St. Michael for medical
treatment.
Jacob Made of Canton, 0., who was a
passenger on the Alliance, thinks the
predictions of the richness of Cape
Nome diggings will not be realized.
He said:
"On several of the claims I saw gold
taken out, but in very small quantities.
In no instance that I know of had bed
rock been reached. It never will be
reached until they can get wood In
there. The only wood In the district is
the drift wood, which is almost as pre
cious as gold. For six days I investi
gated the camp and then came away
thoroughly convinced that the diggings
were by no means as rich as reported.
Hundreds,- at the time I was there, were
flocking in from Dawson. Many will
come out this summer thoroughly dis
gusted."
Among the passengers of the Alliance
was a party of ten from Lowell. Mass.,
which went into the Koyukuk District
last year. L. R. Farrlngton, a member j
of the party, said:
"My candid advice is for people to i
stay away from Koyukuk. The outlook j
Is not encouraging. We took up a par- j
ty of sixteen and left six of them there :
to see what this summer's work would I
pan out. We do not come back disgust- ,
ed and 'sore' with the country, but be- j
lieve that there is not a sufficiency of j
gold to warrant a rush into the coun
try."
David F. Lane, a former real estate
dealer of San Francisco, who was a pas
senger on the Alliance, brings the lat
est news from Ophlr and Melsing
creeks, tributaries of the Neu-l'k-l.uk
River, which is reached by going from
Cape Nome to Golovin Bay and thence
up Fish River. A stampede from Cape
Nome to these creeks took place last;
November. Dane . says pay dirt was
found running from twenty-five cents
to $3 to the pan. Nobody has struck !
bedrock yet. He declares the country
is no place for a poor man to rush off
to. The -wages paid the past winter
were 16 a day and the only chance a
poor man has is to work for wages or
take a lay. Lays were eagerly taken '
on a basis of 30 per cent. Lane says a
miner cannot afford to take a lay for
less than 50 per cent.
Lane secured a number of claims on
Ophir and Melsing creeks. On one
claim ln which he is Interested fifty
men had taken lays. On another claim,
the- Dusty Diamond Company of Chi
cago has secured a lay. In two hours'
1 working the members of this company
took out $60.
In a letter written to Lane by his
partner from Council City on June 25
last, the latter said:
"Yesterday four men on Snow Gulch
cleaned up $4000."
. Dr. Klttleson took out- $42 from one
pan of dirt. Many pans running from
$10 to $25 have been washed out.
''As good a story as any is that of the
' finding of a rich claim on Dexter Creek
jby Leo . Lounenburg. He struck good
ground on Dutch Creek, in El Dorado
district. He then made a trip to Nome
and back and with an old rickety rock
er washed out $23 In two hours on his
claim on Dexter Creek. With a good
'rocker he can take out $150 a day, and
with sluices $1000 a day, and every
thing seems to pay from the grass
roots.
Very few claims up to the time Lane
left for the outside had been prospect
ed. Unprospected claims, or claims
showing pay dirt from the surface
down, were already commanding fab
ulous sums. On Glacier Creek, a tribu
tary of either Ophlr or Mesllng, offers
have been made as high as $25,000 for a
claim. On Ophlr Creek itself good
claims were reckoned as high as $150,
--000. AH the good ground has been
pretty well staked out.
Some of the passengers who came
down on the Alliance do not bring en
couraging reports from the Cape Nome
country. One of these passengers was
George Case of Ithaca, ; N. V., who does
not hesitate to brand Cape Nome as a
fake pure and simple.
"There is no gold at Cape Nome," he
said. "The entire Cape Nome excite
ment has been worked up by transpor
tation and trading companies for the
purpose of taking people up there and
getting money out of them. I have
been in several parts of Alaska, Includ
ing Dawson City and Birch Creek, and
there is plenty of gold there, but there
Is none at Cape Nome.".
J. "V. plenty another there, but there
none at Cape Nome."
.. V. Barrle, another of the Alliance
passengers, claims to have come from
Cape Nome and brings discouraging re
ports of the wealth of that- district. He
claims to have been In that country
about a year and says he saw no pay
ing claims. ,
Captain Walker, in command of the
troops at St. Michael, has sent a detail
of ten men under Lieutenant Spauldlng
to Cape Nome to preserve order.
The ' Alliance had 135 passengers, most
of whom were from Dawson City.

KELLOGG TALKS
ON KISSING BUGS
Their Pedigree Given by

â _â¢ â
ONE APPEARS AT PALO ALTO
â â¦ â
CHILD BITTEN ON THE LIP
WHILE ASLEEP.
. Â« ,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, July 14.
â The advent of the "kissing bug" has
aroused considerable interest among
the scientifically Inclined at the univer
sity, and now that a Well-authenti
cated case has been discovered in Palo
Alto the bugologistfl will keep a sharp
lookout for some specimens.'
A few days ago the little daughter of
E. J. Couch, the proprietor of the Uni
versity Laundry in Palo Alto, was
stung while asleep by some Insect.
When her parents returned It was
found that her upper lip was consider
ably swollen, with a slight cleft where
the sting had entered. The doctor who
attended to the case pronounced It as
undoubtedly the work of the ."kissing
bug." with which he was familiar. The
swelling was reduced, and now the
child Is well. No other cases have been
reported, so It Is believed that Palo
Alto will not prove a profitable sum
mer resort for the Insect.
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg, heal
of the department of entomology at
Stanford, who stands high in the coun
sels of the bugologlsts. has the follow
ing to say ln regit rd to the insect:
The particular species which has been
christened by the newspapers tin "kiss
ing bug" is the Melanolestes plcipes, a
member of the family of Reduviidae, or
assassin bug family as It is known to
entomologists. This - name assassin bug
seems now quite as appropriate as the
other, if we are to believe all the dark
deeds ascribed to the animal. All the
members of this family have strong,
piercing beaks. It does not have a sting
like a bee, but Instead Has beak, which
it thrusts into persons or other inserts
and sucks their blood. Most of them live
on other Insects, but there are some par
ticularly malevolent ones that attack peo
ple. One especially Interesting member
of the family is known as the giant bed
bug killer," because it makes a specialty
of those pests.
All these Insects belong to the larger
order of Ilemlptera, or sucking bugs,
some of which suck plants, others animal
blood. The chinch hug. which does Im
mense damage to the grain crops In the
Mississippi Valley, belongs to this order.
It sticks its beak Into the tender portions
of the plant, sucking Its sap and appar
ently poisoning It. The Reduviidae are
simply one family of this order.
I would say particularly In this connec
tion that a lot of the Injury, damage and
danger from these insects come from the
fear of the person bitten. Some persons
are, of course, more susceptible than oth
ers, but fear plays 8 large part. Col
lectors arc frequently stung, for if the
Insects get a chance they stick their beak
Into the hand, but being without particu
lar fear of them, these stings are gen
erally no more severe than those of a
bee.
One specimen of the kissing bug has
been sent to the department of ento
mology by a southern physician. The
letter accompanying lt explained that
the Insect had attacked a bald-headed
man on the top of the cranium, and
the case at the time of writing was
very serious.
The mention of chinch bugs In the
interview suggested another item of In
terest and Professor Kellpgg said
further: :-?'
Some specimens of Insects were sent me
from near the San Joaquin Valley, under
the supposition that they were the dread
ed pest of the Mississippi, the chinch bug.
The chinch bug Is rarely found here, and
Is not as destructive as further efest. The
bugs received, however, look much like
the chinch bug. and have much the same
habits, but are not nearly so destructive,
nor are they found in such largo num
bers. They are known as the "false
chinch bug to the entomologists. They
had appeared In such numbers that the
farmers had become frightened and had
sent some specimens to me for Informa
tion. I was glad to tell them that the
bugs were not the genuine article, and
that they had but little to fear. :

NSW YORK, July â¢ 14.â George M.
Valentine, cashier of the Middlesex
County Hank of Perth Amboy, N. J.,
which whs closed to-day. has surren
dered himself and now Is In Jail on ac
count Of a shortage in the bank's funds,
which has been variously estimated all
the way US to $1*55.000. The ? affair
caused consternation and dismaj
among the business men of Perth Am
boy. where the Middlesex County Bank
was considered as strong as the eternal
hills. SO stricken did the "*'
dents of Perth Amboy become when it
was learned that the Middlesex Hank
had failed to open for business as usual
this morning that crowds surrounded
the Perth Amboy Savings Institution.
What made the run on the saving-,
bank appear all the more serious was
the fact that the officer- of the Middle
sex County Bank and the officers of the
Perth Amboy institution were identi
cal, the business of both banks being
transacted over the same counter.
Though it became necessary to call
for the aid of the police for tin- purpose
of maintaining order, U. a. Watson,
the president of both banks, says the
funds of the Perth Amboy Savings In
stitution were not touched; that $500.
--000 deposited to the account of the
savings institution Is absolutely safe,
and that no matter how badly the Mid
dlesex County Hank has been wrecked
the savings bank will be able to meet
all demands made upon it by th.' de
positors.
On Monday last Cashier George M.
Valentine eviiently concluded that he
could no longer conceal the shortage of
the Middlesex County Bank. Oil thai
morning be telephoned President Wat
ton that he was detained, but said that
he would appear at noon. The bank
had then opened for business and Mr.
Watson, who was taking the absent
cashier's place, discovered thai there
Should have been Home $7900 in
bills on hand with which to com
mence operations that morning. These
he could not find in the vault. Mr.
Watson was searching for them when
Valentine called him up. lie asked
Valentine where this money was and
was told it had been placed In tin- cash
ier's private drawer. A duplicate key to
111.- drawer Indicated was obtained and
the drawer opened, but no money could
be found.
Robert N. Valentine, the cashier's
brother, was summoned and he aided iii
the search for the missing money.- It
could not be found and finally the work
of checking was begun. Then it became
evident that. during the last few-months
the accounts of the bank had been jug
gled. The other trustees were summon
ed and the banking department was
notified send an examiner. Deputy
Commissioner of Banking Johnson ap
peared in response.' ,
A detailed Investigation of matters by
President Watson and Robert N. Val
â  entine showed that the cashier's checks
i and stubs did not correspond; that the
| checks called for more money than the
stubs recorded, and that While taking
! the stubs as the basis of accounting,
the bank's finances would figure out all
right. Those checks would show that
{ the bank had been drawing heavily on
' its New York correspondent, the Park
: National.
Thursday night the determination to
1 close the bank was reached and Mr.
i Watson notified Chief of Police Burton
! and asked him to locate the missing
' cashier. Valentine, who had . been in
New York City, returned to Perth Am
boy from Woodbrldgo, accompanied by
' his counsel, Edward Savage of Rah
i way. He declined to gp Into the details
; of the shortage of the bank, except
i that he was very sorry that he got his
friends Into trouble and that he felt
very badly about his wife and children.
i President Watson is of the opinion that
I the cashier's defalcation will amount
to nt least $125,000.
"Whore the money went to Is not
known, as th. cashier is said to hive
been moderate in his tastes and habits
of life. He was for years a clerk In
the Park 'National Bank of New York.
In 1893 he was made cashier of the Mid
dlesex County Rank. Ills bond was
fixed for $50,000. His relatives are
wealthy and it Is said they will en

of childish footsteps. .?; _ _
There are tens of thousands of homes
that are childless because of the ill-health
of .the wife and would-be mother. There
are tens of thousands of other homes child-
less because the little ones have died al-
most as soon as they were born. ,In both
cases Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription is
a sovereign remedy. It acts directly on
the delicate ami important organs that
make wifehood and motherhood possible
It makes them well, strong, vigorous, virile,
and elastic. It does away with the dangers
of maternity. It banishes the usual dis-
comforts of the expectant period and
makes baby's advent easy and almost pain-
less. It insures the little new comer's
health and an ample supply of nourish-
ment The prospective mother prepares
herself for maternity by taking the 'Pa
vorite Prescription" and gives her child a
fair start in life by giving it a strong and
well developed body. Thousands of homes
that were childless, to-day echo with
babies' laughter, and bless this great medi-
cine. Thousands of women who were
weak, nervous, despondent invalids, are
to-day happy, healthy wives and mothers

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. July 14.â The Statist in its
editorial on the money outlook to-mor
row will say:
The Bank of England has raised the
bank rate from 3 to 31/3 per cent and 4%
per cent for short advances.
There was some question whether the
general rate should be advanced to 4
per cent, but it was finally decided that
an advance of one-half per cent would
be sufficient for the moment.
This step was practically forced upon
the bank by further heavy reductions
in the reserves of the New York banks
from Â£9,000,000 to Â£1,000,000 sterling.
This reduction not only makes further
gold shipments from the United States
out of the question, but brought Lon
don to face the possibility of New York
taking money from Europe as soon as
wheat begins to move freely.
The continued outflow of cash into
the south, the French competition for
gold in the London market, the inabil
ity of the Bank of England to obtain
gold abroad to a greater extent than is
necessary to meet interior requirements
and the ability of Japan to take gold
away if she requires it â these are all j
additional factors for protecting the re- j
serve. Since July 1 the reserve has de- 1
dined by about Â£900,000.
"Will the present rate have to be fur- |
ther advanced? is the question. Last
year at this date the reserve stood at j
more than Â£25,000,000. Then we were j
calling in money from Germany and the
United States was taking payment for
wheat and cotton largely in securities.
This year we have no balances in Ger
many and may lie unable to pay the
United States by selling stocks. Hence :
we must be prepared either to offer a
discount rate sufficiently high to induce
American banks to keep gold on this
side, or to send gold in payment for
produces. "We may consequently wit
ness a 5 per cent rate here and a higher
rate in Germany than last year.
The Westminster Gazette this after
noon says: A call of Â£1.250,000 will fall
due next Monday for payment on the
Japanese loan and on various other is
sues of capital.
It is understood a small financial
house here arranged to -take the bills
as they arrive from the East through
July at 1%, and, as the discount Is
34. this is a very serious matter for
the firm.
Rumors are therefore current of im
pending financial difficulties, and in the
circumstances it is not surprising that
banks and others are acting with more
than usual precaution just now in
keeping surplus balances well in hand.

Unknown Soldier Meets Death Near
Corte Madera.
SAN RAFAEL. July 14.â An unknown
soldier was struck by an engine in the i
Alto tunnel, near Corte Madera, this even-
Ing and Injured so badly that he died at !
a late hour. The man's skull was frac- :
tured and the left foot severed from the !
body. He was sent to Sausalito in a spe- \
cial car by order of Superintendent Shoe- :
maker and Drs. Mays and Crumpton
summoned, but a message to Coroner i
Eden at 11 o'clock to-night stated that I
medical skill had proved unavailing.
The soldier was about six feet tall, dark !
complexion and smooth faced. A man an- :
swering his description appeared in this j
city yesterday and was obliged to leave |
town in order to escape arrest for refusing |
to pay for his meal. The railroad officials
have so far failed to .learn the unfortu- j
nate man's name. He was evidently in- i
toxicated when he met his death.
BLOODHOUNDS ON THE TRAIL.
Murderer of Wing-field and Rodgers
Surrounded in a Brake.
JEROME, Ariz., July 14.â Sheriff Mund.-.
reached here to-day after eleven days'
chase after the murderer of Wlngfield
and Rodgers. The Sheriff left a posse of
eight men surrounding the Quaking As..
brake. in which they had their man. The
brakes are ten miles wide by twenty iong
and it is Impossible for Indians and cow
boys to follow the trail. The Sheriff
came here to secure bloodhounds to put
on the track and will leave to-morrow
with four dogs.
Lee Cuthbert and John Cameron wero
arrested and sent to Flagstaff for com
plicity in the crime. They supplied the
murderer with provisions. The theory
that Wade committed the crime, the
Sheriff says, is wrong.
CAMP FALLON IN READINESS
FOR THE CADETS.
SANTA CRUZ PREPARES A ROYAL WELCOME
SANTA CRUZ. July 14.â Camp Fallon
Is In readiness for the League of
the Cross Cadets, who are to arrive
In a body to-morrow evening. The
advance guard, under command of
Lieutenant Mahoney, worked diligently all
morning, and by noon the grounds outside
the Dolphin Baseball Park were dotted
with white tents and had taken on a
military appearance. A more pleasant
spot for an encampment could hardly
have, been chosen.
The plan of the camp as prepared by
Colonel Sullivan is an excellent one. There
are fifteen streets, with six SxlO tents to
each street, making a total of ninety
canvas homes for the cadets. The officers'
tents, thirty-two in number, are a little
larger, and face the lodges of the privates.
Five of the latter will probably be as
signed to each tent. The boys will sleep
on sweet straw, while their superiors will
occupy cots.
The advance guard arrived last night, a
dozen tents were pitched and the military
duties began. A guard was stationed
about the camp by Sergeant McDonald.
The first watch was assigned to Corporal
Burke and Privates Buckley and Bigley.
They remained on guard from 9:30 to 11:20
p. m., and were relieved by Corporal Mc-
Dermott and Private Walch and Musician
Pilleter. The latter kept watch until after
midnight and were relieved by Corporal
Beasley and Privates Brophy and Henne
bery. At 2 a. m. the first guard returned
to Its silent duty.
The boys worked with a will, only paus
RETURN OF GOOD
FEELING IN FRANCE
Result of Determined
Government.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. July 14.â A Sun cable
from Paris says: Judging France by
Paris, it appears that the result of strong
and determined government is already
felt.
The military review at Longchamps
to-day was an unqualified success. There
was not the slightest disorder, the threat
ened anti-Government manifestations be
ing conspicuously absent. The whole
world was represented at the review, the
full diplomatic corps being present, with
the exception of the representatives of
Russia, who did not attend owing to of
ficial mourning for the Czarevitch.
France, repossessed of common sense,
celebrated her national festival in a spirit
of fraternity, and good order prevailed
everywhere.
While the republic displayed her mili
tary strength by a review of a large body
of troops, admirably armed and disci
plined, this strength was subservient to
the civil authority, for to-day the Derou
ledes, Drumonts, Beaurepaires and Roche
forts were forgotten or Ignored.
Late to-night a few Insignificant arrests
of disorderly persons were reported. Re
ports from the provinces show that no
serious Incidents occurred. At Rennes
there were a few cries of "Vive Saxce,"
referring to the military commander
there, who was removed a few days ago.
The general good feeling to-day leads to
the Impression that the situation in the
republic Is not as threatening as has been
thought, thanks to strong leadership.

TRACING THE
GRAVE-DIGGERS
Mystery of the Elmwood
Stock Farm.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 14.â discovery of
a half-filled grave on the Elmwood
Stock Farm is still being earnestly dis
cussed by residents of Milpitas. Last
Wednesday afternoon two strange men
and a well-dressed woman were seen
to leave the train at Alvlso and after
inquiring for a man named Smith they
proceeded to walk along the road to
Milpitas. One of the men carried a
spade wrapped in several newspapers.
After reaching the Elmwood Stock
Farm' they halted. One of the men un
covered a spade and proceeded to dig
a grave. His companions stood close
by, the woman presumably having been
instructed to keep a strict lookout for
any resident who might happen to pass
along the road. The grave was dug
to a depth of six feet and was two feet
wide. When they had completed their
strange task they espied C. T. Boots,
manager of the farm, driving toward
them. Seeing the loose dirt piled on the
road he stopped and asked one of the
men what he intended to do. The men
gave an evasive answer, and Mr. Boots,
not thinking seriously of the occurrence
at the time, continued along the road.
About an hour later it ocurred to him
that the mysterious trio might have
committed murder and that they in
tended to bury their supposed victim
in the deep hole they had dug. Sum
moning one of his hired men. Mr. Boots
returned to the unfilled grave, only to
find that it had been covered up and
the woman and the men gone.
Suspecting that the victim of some
murderous crime was buried beneath
the pile of dirt, Mr. Boots ordered his
hired man to uncover the grave. He
found that the sand was loose for a
depth of six feet, convincing him that
the strangers had worked with remark
able alacrity in digging the grave. Mr.
Boots was satisfied in his own mind
that the trio were bent on mischief and
at once telephoned the Sheriff, Inform
ing him of his discovery. It was not
until yesterday, however, that the
Sheriff deemed the discovery of suffi
cient importance to make an investi
gation. He sent two of the deputies
to the scene and after inspecting the
grave they proceeded to examine the
residents.
Several persons were found who had
I seen two men and a woman walking
along the road. Besides a spade they
carried a telescope, basket and a sus
'. picous looking package. After leaving
the scene the trio hurried along the
! road, walking to Alviso, where they
i boarded a train for this city. The most
suspicious circumstances which many
of the residents claim lend color to the
theory that a grave was dug for the
reception of some unknown victim is
I that the trio should dig a hole so deep
and refuse to answer the questions put
to them by Mr. Boots.
The grave was dug in an open place
on a country road where it could be
plainly seen by any passer-by. The fact
that the strangers worked in broad day
; light, however, satisfied several of the
residents that they did not intend to
' use it to cover up a bloody crime. An
j other theory is that they were search
â  ing for lost treasure which they sup
posed was buried there.

Stay in the Ring Regardless.
The Buckley Democratic County Com
mittee at a meeting in the Baldwin An

contemplated permanent organization on
the plan of the Tammany society as out
lined in The Call a week ago.
The committee on permanent organiza

the presenO organization, but made blank
Its recommendations as to the number of
delegates from each district. The first
mentioned recommendation was approved
and the committee was instructed to pre

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, July 14.â A special to the
Republic from Texarkana, Texas, says:
At New Boston, Texas, the county
seat of Bowie County, there occurred
to-day one of the wildest and most des
perate street' battles that has yet been
recorded in the fighting history of that
town.
The trouble emanated from a fuss
over a barbed wire fence which sepa
rated the farms of Ira Smith and W. D.
Hays. The two men met at a prayer
meeting last Sunday, when their case
was talked over between themselves,
resulting in a fight, In which Hays was
bested. The difficulty was brought be
fore the peace officers and the men were
arrested. At their trial to-day, while
a recess was on, the difficulty was re
opened. Smith went into a saloon. W.
D. Hays and his brothers. Hall and S.
J. Hays, followed him. Shooting began
at once.
Smith, who is said to have been un
armed, was killed outright. His friends
i came upon the scene and took a part
lin the conflict. They were Jack Frix
i John Frix and Bill Frix. A general
: battle then ensued. When their, re
i volvers were emptied the participants
used the butt end of their weapons with
deadly effect. W. D. Hays was mor
! tally wounded; S. J. Hays received a
crushed skull and will die. Hall Hays
' was shot in the arm. W. B. Manning,
i ex-County Attorney and not a partici
' pant, was shot twice, one ball crashing
j through his body. Two other bystand
ers were also wounded, one, a merchant
| named W. H. Hart, having his arm
shot off. .'
Hall Hays, the least wounded of any
lof the participants, was arrested and
I placed in jail and other arrests will
follow. None of the Frix brothers were
hurt. Ira Smith and the Hays boys
| were cousins.
e+o+o+o+o+o+o â¦Â©â¦Â©â¦o+o>Â©+#
presidents; A. Currle. secretary, and
I S. Swartz, treasurer. A musical pro
gramme added much to the evening's en
tertainment. _ ;
AMENDED PETITION.
Plan of Apportionment Will Be Filed
To-Day by the Republican
County Committee.
The amended petition of the Republican
County Committee will be filed in the
office of the Board of Election Commis
sioners to-day. The plan of apportion
ment will provide for direct Assembly
district representation on the basis of
the Republican vote cast in each district
at the last general election. The number
of delegates to which each district Is en
titled was published In The Call last
Thursday. The County Committee is now
engaging halls or meeting places for the
organization of clubs under the auspices
of the party. Next Friday night there
will be a meeting In each Assembly dis
trict to form a club. If the representa
tives of the committee, do not attempt
sharp practice in the interest of bosses,
many independent Republicans will ask
for enrollment.
Democrats at Teutonia Hall.
A meeting of the .Democrats of the
Thirty-first District was held at Teutonia
Hall. Howard street, last night. P. M.
Hare occupied the chair. The meeting
was addressed by A. B. Morgan. C. D.

TuE CO/YUNG AUTOMOBILE.
WITH the starting of The Call-Herald automo
bile on its trip across the continent there be
gins a system of overland travel destined to de
velop into enormous proportions. No intelligent
man will venture to fix the limits of speed, of
strength and of convenience the. new vehicle may yet
attain before some better system of locomotion is de
vised by increasing ingenuity to supersede it.
At the present time it is a disputed point whether
the power for propelling the vehicles can be best ap
plied by gasoline, by electricity or by compressed
air. Each has its defects and its advantages. For
long distance journeyings gasoline is preferred, and
will be used for the automobile now speeding across
the continent to The Call office. Recent experiments
in France, however, show that on good roads stor-
age batteries are capable of propelling the vehicles for
considerable distances at high rates of speed with-
out being recharged. A journey was made by such a
car a short time ago from Paris to Rouen, a distance
of sixty- five miles, within a Tittle over seven hours.
What may yet be accomplished by compressed air
is hard to foretell. So wonderful are its possibilities
that not a few sanguine experimenters maintain it
will be eventually the sole motive power in use by
civilized nations where anything more is needed than
a windmill or a water-wheel. At present, however,
the force of compressed air has not been extensively
applied, although notable successes have been at
tained with it in many directions in an experimental
way and for street railways in some Eastern cities. It
is to electric storage batteries, therefore, we must
look for the development of the use of automobiles
in the immediate future, at least in districts where
electricity can be readily obtained.
It is announced that the Standard Electric Com
pany is considering plans for supplying electricity for
use by automobiles along both sides of San Fran
cisco Bay as far south as San Jose. The electricity
is to be generated by power from the Blue Lakes, in
the Sierras, and frequent stations will be provided in
the route around the bay at which the storage bat
teries can be recharged. " The plan appears feasible,
and if carried out will doubtless prove profitable.
With the coming of the automobile many issues
that have long complicated local transportation
problems will vanish of themselves. The good roads
men will not have to enter upon a campaign of edu
cation on the advantages of wide tires, for the new
vehicle will necessarily have a wide tire, and will en
force the construction of better roads. We shall also
avoid the evils arising from slippery pavements and
the difficulties which horses have in maintaining a
foothold upon them. The automobile will not slip
nor fall.
So the new era in transportation comes with the
coming of the automobile across the continent from
the Herald office. Even as it progresses on its long
way new progress is being made by inventors and
mechanics in perfecting it. When it arrives here and
is exhibited at the ..Lechanics' Institute it will repre
sent the best mechanism and the most wonderful ac
complishment of automobiles up to date, but it will
not hold the record long. In the new machine the
history of the locomotive is to be repeated, and for
years to come it will be improved continuously, until
in the end it becomes something more wonderful than
is dreamed of at this time. â¢ 'â  Â-.â¢_

FORCING CIVILIZATION.
THE address delivered to the teachers at Los
Angeles by Dr. W. T. Harris, United States
Commissioner of Education, was a very interest
ing and eloquent and artful presentation . of certain
views so fundamentally wrong, that it is a pity so
much excellence in composition and delivery was
wasted in an effort to make wrong seem right.
Throughout it was a persistent suggestion that we
can .do with our "subject" races and peoples just
what the Czar has done with Poland and is doing
, with Finland and the Kaiser is doing with Alsace and
; Lorraine. Mr. Harris said that in view of the fact that
j other nations are dividing up. the world, the people
I think it our duty to show what we can do in that line.
| He thought the United States can uplift whole na
tions, and that we should not build a Chinese wall
around our liberties, but should force our civiliza
tion, the civilization of the printed page, upon such
colonies as come to us, and it is absurd to say that
we will tyrannize over those incapable of self-govern-
ment.
It is difficult to keep one's patience in reading such
utterances from a professor and doctor of laws,- sup
posed, by the position he holds, to be the leader of
his guild in the Union.
There is but one line of cleavage which civilization
follows, and that is the line of physical necessity.
That necessity exists in the temperate zone, where
it has been the mother of invention, and by inven
tion civilization progresses. The civilization of the
temperate* zone cannot be domesticated in the torrid
zone. That civilization, which has so multiplied by
art the means of existence where life is a struggle
against the resistance of nature, as to make possible
the enormous modern increase in the temperate zone
nations, if transferred with all its inventions to the
tropics would be nearly as destructive of life as it is
here promotive of it.
All of the things permanent in civilization, in gov
ernment, in institutions, are due to the energy of
man and not to the bounty of nature. As we ap
proach the equator the energy of man declines, and
nature complements its lack by her spontaneous
bounty which supports existence with but little
effort.
To talk about forcing the civilization of one zone
upon the other, is the equivalent of forcing the bear to
eat straw like the ox, and the ox to eat meat like the
bear.
The tropics have their civilization, suited to the
environment, and after ages of effort no other has
been forced upon them, unless so mongrelized as to
lose its distinctive features. â '
All knowledge, all learning, all artificial application
of invention and discovery, is for one purpose and
no other. That purpose is enlargement of the provi
sions and betterment of the conditions upon which
human life depends. These conditions respond pri
marily to hunger, thirst and nakedness. Food,
drink and shelter must be had and the supply must
be instant and constant. All human devices are
planted in these primal necessities and their blooming
into art and science has never been and will never be,
except their root is planted in these first necessities of
existence.
Enough has been said to show that civilization is
a natural evolution; that its form and measure are
determined by environment which fixes the neces
sities they must supply; that where these necessities,
arising in the resistance of nature may be overcome
by human energy civilization is the highest; where
natural resistance is insurmountable, as beyond the
Arctic Circle, civilization is the lowest; and where
nature offers the least resistance, as in the tropics, its
form is determined by environment, and differs as
widely from that of the temperate zone as do the
races of the two zones.
After all that Huxley, Darwin, Draper, Andrew D.
White, Herbert Spencer and others have written it
seems strange that all these things have to be said
over again to the National Commissioner of Educa
tion. It Would seem that he might have given his
views of the possibility of pushing education in the
tropics, without unnecessarily mixing education with
the institutions which mark our civilization. Educa
tion, general and common, exists under institutions
widely different from ours. If writing and reading its
language and having knowledge of fundamental
mathematics determine the literacy of a people, the
Chinese are our superiors, but we have no doubt that
Dr. Harris would object if they should, therefore,
claim the right to force their civilization upon us. As
Dr. Harris strayed still further from his proper
datum line, he plunged into worse errors. He scouted
the idea that our rule of subjects, whom we decide to
be incapable of self-government, will be tyrannical.
He should know that no yoke can be laid by one man
upon another without that other's consent, so softly
as not to gall. That fact has made the history of the
world. It was the dynamic force that has exploded
and scattered all empires from Babylon to Spain. It
is the terror of England, whose day will come, as
doom has come to all her predecessors in that path,
and will come to all who follow her therein.
DENUDING THE MOUNTAINS.
AN elaborate paper by Marsden Manson on the
extent to which our mountains are being
stripped of forests, published in . the Sierra
Club Bulletin for June, constitutes a valuable addi
tion to the literature of that important subject. The
problem involved in the protection of forests is one
we must soon grapple in earnest, for in California,
more, perhaps, than in any other State in the Union,
does the preservation of the forests mean a preserva
tion of the State itself as a habitable territory.
The subject is one with which the people are now
fairly familiar. It has been discussed time and again
in The Call, as well as. in other publications, and the
facts are known to all who take a sufficient interest in
the future welfare of the State to pay attention to such
matters. The salient point of Mr. Marsden's paper is
the showing made of the injury done to agricultural
lands by the denudation of the neighboring moun
tain ranges of their forests, and the argument upon it
is both clear and forcible.
The Old World furnishes warnings to the New of
the desolation which results from the denudation of
the mountains. In Asia Minor and in Southern
Europe vast regions which were once fertile and sup
ported prosperous populations, even with the primi
tive system of agriculture practiced in ancient times
and in the middle ages, are now so barren that even
scientific agriculture cannot render them available for
human habitation. Vast sums of money and great
labor have been expended in reforesting some of the
mountain slopes in Europe, but the work is slow, and
it will take centuries of time to replace the soil washed
away after the forests had been destroyed.
The work of devastation is being carried on in our
mountains with a rapidity and on a scale far in ex
cess of anything known in Europe. Our mechanical
ingenuity has provided us with means of stripping
forests from the mountains with something like
lenuity has provided us with means of stripping
.sts from the mountains with something like
magic, and, in addition to what is done in that way,
a sweeping destruction is carried on every year by
forest fires. It is, therefore, with a tremendous speed
we are bringing the rich territory of California into
THE SAIN" FRANCISCO CALL., SATURDAY, JULY 15, 1899.
something like the condition that now prevails at
the foot of the Pyrennees.
The need cf providing some remedy for the evil is
so imperative that the attention of the public cannot
be too often called to it. The Sierra Club has done
well, therefore, in publishing the paper with photo
graphs showing the condition of the denuded dis
tricts, and it is to be hoped it will have a wide cir
culation, a careful reading and an attentive considera
tion from thoughtful Californians.
INTERNAL REVENUE REVISION.
REPORTS from our special correspondent at
Washington are to the effect that it is prob
able the Internal Revenue Bureau will recom
mend to Congress the enactment of a considerable
number of changes in the war revenue law. The
prime object of the recommendations is an increase
of revenue, but in some cases changes are needed to
clear up disputed points of the law and make its bur
dens more equitable.
Among the propositions for increasing the revenue
now under discussion by the -officials are a tax on
the sale or rental of patent-protected devices, such as
telephones, and a tax upon telegraph and express
companies doing a money exchange business. The
changes suggested for the sake of greater clearness
and for equalizing the burdens of taxation are many,
and include a modification of the provisions of the
law with respect to mutual insurance companies and
a thorough revision of the list of articles taxed under
schedule B, as it is said the section defining what ar
ticles are taxed in that list has been a source of much
trouble and embarrassment to the officials. V
Whether the Internal Revenue Bureau make the
reported recommendations or not, it is fairly certain
Congress will undertake a revision of the law. The
act was drawn up and passed- to meet the emergency
of the sudden outbreak of war, and has all the defects
of hasty legislation. The people bore it willingly,
because the nation needed the revenue, and
patriotism prompted a loyal support to any act which
provided it. From the beginning, however, it was
felt that the taxes provided by it are unequally im
posed, and, moreover, the language is in many places
so vague as to lead to grave doubts as to its meaning
and intent.
One of the more serious evils resulting from it is
that under its terms telegraph and express companies
have found legal quibbles on which to base a claim
that their business is not taxed', but that the public is
taxed for patronizing them. Under these pretenses
the companies have been practicing extortion ever
since the act went into effect, and, while the courts
have repeatedly decided against them, they have been
able to defy the courts, mock at the law and sneer at
every protest of the public against the wrong.
The course of the Wells-Fargo Company in this
city illustrates the extent to which defects in the law
permit tax-shirking to be practiced. The president
of the company, J. J. Valentine, a man who poses as
a pious church-goer as well as an unctuous patriot,
set about devising a means of defrauding the Gov
ernment as soon as the act was drawn up, and he had
the impudence to ask The Call to share in the profits
of the fraud. His proposition was that The Call should
send its papers in packages to the express company
covered with one cover, and then his company would
receipt for the whole wagon-load as one patkage.
Evidence has been disclosed that similar fraudulent
proposals were made to other large shippers, and in
some cases big shippers were not required by the
company to pay the tax at all.
Such instances of extortion practiced upon the pub
lic and of fraud, designed at least, upon the Govern
ment prove the need of a revision of the law. When
amended it should provide a penalty upon tax
shirking corporations, and also a penalty upon the
corporation officials, who devise tricks and frauds for
robbing the public and cheating the Government.
ANOTHER TAMMANY MOVE.
[_____J OR all that Bryan wins out at Jackson ban
quets, Jefferson feasts and Independence day
celebrations in the very stronghold of Tammany,
the chiefs who are seeking his scalp never abandon
his trail. Their persistence inclines to the belief they
have a stratagem in their minds by which they yet
hope to defeat him when the time comes for the big
fight in the convention, and the belief is strengthened
by the beginning of a sudden agitation in New York
for doing away with the old two-thirds rule in Demo
cratic national conventions.
It is recognized by the astute chiefs of Tammany
that if the rule were set aside at the convention itself
there might result a serious disaffection in the party.
Accordingly it is recommended that the subject 'be
discussed and brought up for action at the State con
ventions, by which delegates are to be elected to the
national gathering. If a majority of the delegates
can be pledged by their constituents to adopt a rule
providing for a Presidential nomination by a majority
vote, there would then be no ground for an effective
protest, as the action would clearly represent the will
of Democracy throughout the Union.
The two-thirds rule has prevailed in Democratic
councils for so long a time that a very extensive and
very persuasive campaign of education will be re
quired to induce veteran Democrats to abandon it.
It was adopted long before the war for the purpose
of preventing the nomination of a sectional candi
date, for in those days there were many sectional is
sues in politics. It has been continued ever since,
partly by reason of the force of precedent, and partly
because it is still regarded as a means of keeping
sectionalism out of Democratic conventions.
The issue itself is one of more concern to Demo
cratic politicians than to the country at large. The
point of public interest in the discussion lies in the
fact that it should have been raised at all at this time.
Has Tammany a candidate in sight for whom it can
count something like a majority, but for whom it
cannot hope for a two-thirds vote? â¢â¢â -'â '
If there be such a candidate available against
Bryan the sooner Tammany makes the fact known
the better it will be for the campaign of education for
the abrogation of the two-thirds rule. As the case
is presented now, the discussion seems hardly more
than an academic debate upon an abstract issue of
party management, and few people will pay much at
tention to it. Let it once be made known, however,
that it signifies an organized effort ' to obtain the
Presidential nomination for some particular candi
date, and the campaign of education will go forward
with all the vim and vigor of a dogfight.
The Czar of Russia has announced officially that
somewhere in. his intellectual make-up there is an
clement of humiliation hitherto unsuspected. He says
that he bows without a murmur to the decree of
Providence.
.
The national Populists insist that their identity shall
be preserved in the next Presidential campaign.
Somebody ought to suggest to them to go somewhere
and find themselves.

"CARMEN," AN
OLD FAVORITE
AT THE GRAND
We get on firm and familiar footing
when the overture of "Carmen" strikes
up; and where Is there a more welcome
familiar? XV have so often heard the
opera beautifully done, and many a time
done to a cruel death. We like it best
when not sung In English. The nudity of
an understood language subtracts too
much from the imagination. Sung so. it
seems wilted of Its crispness and to have
had an overgrown reputation. Neverthe
less, the performance at the Grand Opera
house Is one of conspicuous merit, well
staged, well sung and well applauded. To
say that it is sparkling, bubbling, free,
fresh, Spanish, would be to beslaver with
uncritical praise. The ensemble work is
excellent, but the abandon Is not there.
They stand on tables in simulation of the
devil-may-care, but they do it because
the stage manager has put them there.
Obedience is reflected In every turn of
the heel. Miss Hattie Belle Ladd does not
look Carmen. Her make-up suggests the
masquerade rather than the real charac
ter and recalls the Celtic rather than the
Spanish.. Unless we except Olga Nether
sole there are no path-breakers in the
role. The old traditional business is safer
to follow. But Miss ...add is not wicked
enough and does not run successfully
through the phases of barbaric impetuos
ity and delicate treacherous coquetry.
She bundles the commonplace and grace
ful In her "acting until we wish she would
cast tradition to the winds; be herself
and originate. We have, however, the
compensation of her voice. Her melodi
ous rendering of the dainty numbers we
expected and were not disappointed. She
has a rich, mellow, companionable voice,
and sings with such a comfortable sense
of surety and lack of effort.
Mr. Persse sings the lover well. He has
tremendous crescendo possibilities In his
voice, but he has an unfinished way of
reaching their height.
Miss Mason sang as she always doesâ
simply, easily and effectively. The role
does not tax the dramatic powers, and
hence she makes a rather easy success.
No toreador ever sang without being en
cored. Applause follows from very tradi
tion, but Mr. Goff deserves the demand.
One hears him again with satisfaction.
The last act is by far the best. It ia
presto and does not tarry, and the curtain
rings down on a fine picture of passion
and pain. After all, dramatic instinct
knows best what to do with the Carmen 3
of the world. We should hate to contem
plate the old age of such.

cover It. It is allowed to soak during the
night and It Is then ready, or soft enough
to melt readily with moderate heat. Wa
ter is added to reduce it to the desired
consistency. It is then applied to the
wall, which must flrst have been brushed
down to remove dust and freed from any
grease spots. The same may be used to
prepare plastered walls for an application
of oil paint.

THE NEWMAN WRECK
Truth Touching the Railroad Dis=
aster May Come Out.
Fearless, Unhampered Inquiry by the Jury Should
Establish the Personal Responsibility for
the Sacrifice of Human Life.
THE duty of fixing the responsibility
for the recent railroad disaster at
Newman seems to rest with the au
thorities of Stanislaus County. If
the subject matter should be left
with the Southern Pacific managers
no doubt the unfortunate ladles who were
crushed to death in the wreck would be
blamed, but the usual railroad method of
putting the responsibility on those who
cannot speak for themselves will not be
acceptable in the approaching inquiry.
Practical railroad men assert that
Hartwell. the operator at Newman, can
not be implicated by any fair line of
reasoning. It is contended that he obeyed
rule 390 of the revised regulations, which
fits the case at Newman. While the spe
cial passenger was an Irregular train, the
orders on which it was running gave it
certain rights. Train 245, the freight, had
notice of the running of the special when
it received copies of the double order. To
make the matter clear, here Is an illus
tration of the system:
The special, which may for example be
designated No. 1. came from Sacramento
to Tracy under the supervision of a dis
patcher who has nothing whatever to do
with the line from Tracy to Mendota, that
line being under charge of dispatcher No.
2. who is advised of the time that the
special will reach Tracy from Sacra
mento. Dispatcher No. 2 arranges his
business so as not to delay the special
and put out an order in this form:
To conductor and engineer No. 245â
Tracy.
To conductor and engineer extra 1721â
Tracy.
Engine 1721, Fassett, will run extra from
Tracy to Mendota and will pass No. 245,
engine 1414, where overtaken.
This is signed by the conductor of No.
245, and he is given two copiesâ one he
keeps, the other is given to. his engineer.
The conductor of the special likewise
signs it and gets two copies for himself
and engineer. In this way train 245 is
advised to be on the lookout for the fol
lowing train and the same order is the
authority of the special to pass No. 245.
Now if this order was usedâ It Is
about 100 to 1 that it wasâ 245 should
have been prepared at any station to let
the special pass. If the order was not
given in the form as above, then the dis
patcher at the superintendent's headquar
ters is culpable. Assuming that the dou
ble order was in the hanus of both crews,
then No. 245 should have protected not
only the rear of their own train, but have
been on the alert to facilitate the move
ment of the special by having the switch
thrown so the special could pass through
the siding. The results do not show that
this was done.
The facts so far gleaned establish the
belief that Operator Hartwell at New
man properly changed his signals as the
regulations require from -white .to red.
and back to white again. His signal was
answered by Engineer Allen. The answer
to the signal shows that the engineer of
the special was not asleep. It was not
Hartwell'3 duty to go out in the yard
and ascertain if the switch was placed
to permit the special to pass, but It was
somebody's duty "to adjust the switch.
The track is straight for two miles west
of Newman. Allen, the engineer of the
special, could see the white light in the
semaphore signal. He had no notice that
the signal was to be at white. He must
see lt red and see it changed to white,
else he must stop. There is one point
raised against Allen and that Is that he
violated the rules in not having bis train
under control in approaching a station.
He had signals, however, that the track
was clear.
The inquiry by the Coroner of Stani
slaus County should bring out all the
facts regarding the display or non-display
of red tail lights on the freight train.
The testimony of the crew of the special
may be important on this point.
Freight trains usually have a caboose on
the rear. Train 245 did not, but instead
had a coach. The question may be asked,
"Where is the difference?" Here it is: A
caboose has a cupola that exhibits a
bright red light, showing both forward
and backward, at an elevation of fourteen
feet from the rails, and in addition there
are two side lights hung on either side
of the caboose. On a coach there are
usually two side lights at an elevation
of eight feet from the rails and some
times a red light placed on the platform
on a level of the car floor.
It appears that No. 245 goes to Fresno
as a fast freight and returns to Oakland
per as a passenger train on daylight
runs, where lamps and lanterns are not
needed. Â , ._. ,
Practical railroad men maintain that
the conductor of the special is not blame
less He should have known exactly
where his train was. If the speed was
too high approaching the station he
should have checked it by using the air
brake appliance just Inside the door of
the sl^^pcr*
The Coroner's jury of Stanislaus County
should see that all the facts are brought
to light, regrardless of the favor or dis
favor of the Southern Pacific. The day
has gone by in California for the rail
road company to prepare in advance de
crees for the courts to sign and verdicts
for the juries to bring in.
The jury to investigate the causes of
the loss of life at Newman should find
Where was the conductor of 245
when the accident occurredâ whether ln
the telegraph office or elsewhere?
Secondâ What part of the train was the
conductor of the special in; where were
his brakemenâ in the cars or out on plat
forms? ___''_.'._;Â»_
Thirdâ What instructions did the con
ductor of 245 give to his rear brakeman
in Sard to this special; why was It that
he did not have a red lantern to flag with
instead of a white light?
Fourthâ How far was it from the
rear of car No. 245 to the switch
leading to the side track that the special
should have been run Into? Did the brake
man pass this switch in his efforts to flag
the special? If he did, why did he not
throw the switch to side track? If Op
erator Hartwell could see or hear the
special, why could not the rear brakeman
of 245, whose duty it Is to always be a.
rear car of train, see or hear It?
If these questions cannot be . satisfac
torily answered it would be well to in
quire just how many hours elapsed from
the time the crews of the two trains ar
rived at Oakland and Sacramento before
they were called to come out onnhelr re
spective trains, for if they did not have
a sufficient time to rest then it, is easy
to see how hard it Is for men to keep
awake in the "small hours" of the night.
A question some one in authority at the
yellow building should be asked Is this:
Why are special passenger trains run
past Lathrop over, to Tracy, thence to
Fresno via Mendota, when time and mile
age can be saved on a road going direct
from Lathrop to Fresno and on a line
where a train seldom runs at night?
Possibly the reply to this question will be
satisfactory to the manipulators of the
traffic, but it may not give satisfaction to
the patrons of the road.
Perhaps the Pacific Improvement Com
pany owns the bridge across the San
Joaquin west of Lathrop; and if it does
the inside managers may get a head tax
on each passenger, the same as they do
for traffic over the bridge across the Colo
rado River at Yuma. Collis P. does not
often get left, as was shown a few years
ago, when Sir Rivers Wilson was out here
on a supposed Inquiry Into Central Pacific
affairs. Then the company had men work
ing day and night to change the Initial
on every car possible in West Oakland to
read C. P.," and for this purpose several
hundred empty flatcars were hauled in
and labeled, only to be changed back to
original designation when Sir Charles. wa?
gone. He was properly attended to by the
Piedmont president of the Central Pacific
while here.
Such is railroad life, and it is such
truckling work as that that leads up to
results like that at Newman. If the
special had run from Lathrop to Fresnc
it would have had a clear track from all
trains In either direction from before the
time it left Sacramento until 5:30 a. m.
On the Tracy-Mendota line it was due to
meet between 1 o'clock at Tracy and 5
o'clock at Fresno one regular freight, two
regular passenger and several extras, be
sides two regular freights to overtake and
pass. The wear and tear on a man's
"gray matter" is quite different on the
two routes. Possibly after the consolida
tion of the Central Pacific with the Ken
tucky corporation lines that are owned
by thÂ« Central Pacific will get their dues.
Meantime the people will wait and see
what the verdict of the Coroner's jury'
will be ln the inquest of the Newman sac
rifice.
HOSTETTER BITTERS SUIT.
Action Taken Against Merchants for
Infringing Upon the Trademark.
E. Edgar Galbreth, a prominent attor

on behalf of the Hostetter Company of
Pittsburg, Perm., against persons and
firms for substituting spurious mixtures
in place of Hostetter's bitters; for selling
the spurious mixtures in bulk and for
refilling genuine Hostetter bottles with
the mixtures named, thereby defrauding
the public. The defendants are: E. P.
Modry & Co., E. Martininl, Ahrens, Peln

KNIGHTS REFUSED TO PAY.
Question Arises on Policies Held by
Soldiers Killed in Action.
Mrs. Louisa Richter, widow of Cap
tain R. Richter of the First California
Regiment, who was killed in battle at
Manila, has sued the Knights of Pythias
to recover $3000 upon a life insurance pol
icy held in the order by her husband.
Plaintiff states that the lodge refuses to
pay on the ground that the by-laws of
the order prohibit the payment of life
insurance moneys upon a policy held by
a member who voluntarily goes to war
and is killed in action. Mrs. Richter
claims that the by-laws mentioned does
not act against the policy in her hands,
as her husband joined the order in 1891,
prior to the enactment of the by-law in
question.
BOND ASSESSMENTS
NOT STRICKEN OUT
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION DE
NIES BANK PETITIONS.
Protests of Corporations and Prop
erty Owners Considered â
Reductions to Small
Holders.
The Board of Supervisors met as a
Board of Equalization yesterday to con
sider the applications of banking and
other corporations for reductions of as
sessments arbitrarily raised by Assessor
Dodge. The banks wanted their assess
ments reduced in sums varying from tens
of thousands to millions. They based
their protests on the claim that the vari
ous bondsâ railroad, municipal and other
wiseâwere not subject to taxation,
though the Attorney General recently
rendered an opinion that these bonds can
be taxed. On this question of the as
sessment of bonds the board promptly
disposed of petitions by denying them.
The matter is now in the courts and the
board stated that it did not desire to as
sume judiciary powers.
The Contra Costa Water Company's as
sessment of $700,000 came up and Super
visor Lackmann moved that it be re
duced to $500,000. The motion was lost
and Supervisor Algeltlnger moved that
the corporation pay only on Its franchise
or on $1000. A strong effort was made by
the majority to pass Aigeltinger's mo
toin, but through the tactics of Perrault,
who moved to amend by reducing fhe
assessment to $499,000, it failed. After a
motion to indefinitely postpone, the mat
ter was laid over until 10 o clock on Mon
day, when all the corporations will be
given a hearing. â¢ .
The Stockton Gas Company requested
that Its assessment be reduced from $105.
--000 to $1000. It was proved to the satis
faction of the board that the company
pays on $163,229, and on this showing the
application was granted unanimously.
The following applications for reduc
tions in assessments were granted.
D. J. Tallant from $15,000 to $12,500: Robert
Mills, $9000 to $6000; Eugenia Cole, $10,500 to
$7000; J. A. Piel, $2250 to $2075; W. P. Kane,
$2250 to $2000; C. C. Pernau. $4640 to $3630: M. A.

Taylor. $1300 to $1200; M. Mattson, $1500 to $1000;
Hannah Ryan, $2500 to $2000; Auerbach & New

Alfred Davis. $3500 to $2500; A. E. Davis, $13,
--500 to $12,500; A. Winterberg, $1000 to $750;
Jeannette May. $1500 to $1000.
C. D. Salfield appeared before the board
and charged Deputy Assessor Miesages
with incompetence and favoritism in as
sessing certain Western Addition blocks.
The subject will be taken up this morn
ing, as will also applications of small
property owners. -. ; â¢.
The San Francisco Gas ana Electric
Company has also petitioned for a large

WM. F. WHITTIER
SERIOUSLY ILL
Fell and Ruptured a Blood
Vessel in His
Head.
WILLIAM F. WHTTTIER, the
capitalist, is lying seriously ill
at his home on the corner of
Jackson and Laguna streets.
He is suffering from a ruptured blood
vessel in the head, and the family
physician is constantly in attendance.
The Illness of Mr. Whlttler Is due
to an accident that seemed very trivial
when it happened. When the season
opened he went trout fishing on the
McCloud River, and met with splendid
success. Every day he secured a
basket of the speckled beauties, and in
consequence prolonged his stay. To
ward the end of his outing he went to
a favorite fishing ground in a wagon,
and while he whipped the stream a
driver remained in charge of the rig
and followed Mr. Whlttler in his wan
derings. Toward evening the flsher= WILLIAM F. whittier.
man returned to the wagon, which '
was on the side of a hill. In getting In, Mr. Whlttler had to climb past thÂ«
driver to reach his seat, and in doing so his feet caught In the reins and
he fell to the ground on his face. ,
Mr. Whlttler was somewhat confused by his fall, but at once got to his
feet and proceeded to stop a slight nose bleed. He felt heavy-headed all that
evening and the next day. but thought nothing of It. Not feeling like In
dulging in any more fishing, Mr. Whlttler came home and resumed his reg
ular business. A couple of days later, however, he became so 111 that he
had to take to his bed and the family physician was summoned.
It was then ascertained that the fall he had received on the banks of thÂ©
McCloud River had ruptured a blood vessel In his head and that his condi
tion was precarious. Last night he was improving, but his doctor does not
yet consider him out of danger.

THE REAL SITUATION.
â¦
Too Much Clemency Is Shown to a,
Treacherous Foe A Large Arm/
Only Can Suhdue the
Filipinos.
The whole truth regarding the situation
of affairs in the Philippines will soon be
presented to the American people. Offi
cers of sound Judgment and keen Intelli
gence are convinced that a colorless
statement of fact will convince the coun
try that the management of affairs on the
island of Luzon is not commendable from
a civil or military point of view.
Returning officers who are about to as
sume again the obligations and privileges
of citizenship are relieved of military con
straint in the expression of opinion con
cerning the management of the cam
paign. One officer who had an excellent
opportunity to form correct Judgment
wrote his sentiments yesterday. He pre
sented the situation in this style of com
"The rapid flight of events In the Phil
ippines, resulting In the Insurrection, has
called for two kinds of material that has
been very scarce ln the United States for
some years, viz., statesmanship and gen
eralship. Strange as it may seem, these
poor half savages, for whom we went to
war out of humanity, have not only
beaten us at every turn in diplomacy, but
have outgeneraled us In war. The fact
that we have defeated them is simply
due to the valor and shooting ability of
the American soldier. _______
"The writer, arriving on the islands
with the first expedition, has seen much
of the Philippines and their people, and
believes that a plain, unvarnished state
ment of the facts as they exist Is due to
the American public. Through the hun
dred years of our constitutional govern
ment we have faced some grave problems
but they have all been settled for the
best Interests of all the people and let
us hope that the Intelligence of the coun
try w-11l again assert itself, throw the
searchlight of Investigation on our co
lonial policy and provide the proper reme
dies In morals, as in medicine there Is
no antlseptlo like the sunlight of Al-
m '-What G hf 'our policy as to the' Philip
pines? The question is easily answered.
We haven't any. We have adopted
the Spanish colonial system leaving
out" its greatest essential-firmness.
Our customs are payable only in
Spanish money, which appreciates the
"doby" Mexican dollar to the discredit of
American gold. We â¢ have shown much
clemency to a treacherous foe. This pol
icy in my opinion, has been disastrous
to' 'us. General Otis Is too weak. His
method of warfare has given the enemy
courage to continue the fight. What is
needed is the strong, firm hand of a great
eeneral, along with at least a hundred
thousand well equipped men. Our present
force is entirely inadequate to our needs,
and we are not ln a position to occupy a
one-hundredth part of the islands.
"In the event of subjugation what bene
fits will the American people obtain?
What advantage can we derive from the
cheap labor of eleven million Islanders?
The American laborer cannot compete
with the native. When the natives have
been educated to the American standard
of civilization the products of the several
islands will be required to support the
population of the archipelago.

A MOTHER'S DEBAUCH.
Maggie Peterson Neglects Her Child
and Steals a Roll of Bedding.
Another case of a mother's cruelty and
depravity came to the knowledge of the
police last night and the mother in ques
tion, Maggie Peterson of 229.. Sixth street,
is now in the City Prison, charged with
petit larceny and cruelty to a child. The
infant daughter of the prisoner is being
cared for by the matron of the City
Prison and may be sent to some public
institution.
Police Officer M. T. Cooney was sum
moned by the proprietor, James Tann, to
the house In which the Peterson woman
lived, who said Mrs. Peterson had stolen
some bedding. The officer went to her
room and found Maggie in a drunken
stupor. In her arms a baby girl, hungry,
unkempt and crying at the top of its weak
voice, was found. The baby was removed
from its unpleasant position and then the
officer and proprietor of the place spent
half an hour In a fruitless effort to arouse
the woman. Failing to accomplish their
undertaking mother and child were re
moved to the prison. ,
The arresting -officer said" that Maggie
had been drinking heavily for a week and
hence no one knows what must have been
the baby's suffering during that period.

MRS. ADAMS ON THE STAND.
Prosecuting Attorney Fails to Break
Her Down on Cross-Examination.
Mrs. Minnie Adams, charged with the
murder of her Infant son, John Richard
Grey, was again on the stand in Judge
Lawlor's court yesterday. Her direct ex
amination was concluded, and Assistant
District Attorney Soloman took up the
cross-examination. He covered the testi
mony published In yesterday's Call at
length, ln fact, going Into the minutest
details of the prisoner's life the few days
before the child's death. His questions
were calculated to tax the best mmory,
but Mrs. Adams wavered but little from
her original story.
Up to the present she has defied the ef
forts of the prosecuting attorney to break
down her story.

He Tried to Please Every One in the
Liquor Order Matter, With the
Result That He Is in
Trouble.
â¦
When the Southern Pacific directors, ln
compliance with the wishes of C. P.
Huntington, passed the order prohibiting
the sale of liquor at the stations along the
lines of their road they raised a hornet's
nest about tneir ears. Through the efforts
of the Commercial Travelers' Protective
Association, every large liquor house in
the city was prevailed upon to take the
matter up and protest against the action.
These protests carried enough weight to
compel the directors to reconsider their
action. - They could not openly rescind the
order in its entirety nor could they allow
it to remain in force without bringing
upon themselves a responsibility which
they were not prepared to face. ;
They therefore passed the burden to
General Manager Kruttschnitt, placing
him between themselves and the people.
At the^same time they gave him a neat
turndown by adding a kltetall to the
order,* which provides him with full dis
cretion in the matter, that says liquor
shall not be abolished at those stations
where meals are regularly served to the
traveling public.
Had Kruttschnitt been a real wise man
he might have overcome the difficulty by
taking a firm stand either on one side
or the other, but he tried to carry water
on both shoulders and got t_M.roughly
soused for his pains. As the matter was
left to his own judgment, he began to
discriminate and his discrimination has
in every instance been founded on selfish
ness, not on justice." Those men who had
influence with the company or who, for
reasons of policy, the company did not
care to antagonize, were allowed to run
on In the old way, while others who were
doing a legitimate business based on noth
ing but their industry and integrity were
given notice to shut up.
Thus Ben Steinman, who for twenty
eight years ran the eating place at Sac
ramento, was obliged to step out to give
Lewis Hanchett an opportunity to step
in. Mr. Steinman is an ex-Mayor, Mr.
Hanchett Is a brother-in-law to one of the
directors. The traveling men had to be
placated. Mr. Kruttschnitt wrote to their
president telling him that the order had
been rescinded and, to use Kruttschnitt's
own words, that "In the future the travel
ing public will be able to enjoy the same
facility in purchasing liquor at the eat
ing stations that has been enjoyed here
tofore."
The following interview obtained from
Owen' Rooney, who conducts the eating
house at the Oakland pier, and who is
one of those without a pull, tells the story
of the double cross that Kruttschnitt has
attempted to give the Commercial Trav
elers' Protective Association: ;.
"I have received a letter from Manager
Kruttschnitt," said he. "It is an answer to
one I sent on June 25. It Informs me that the
order forbidding the sale of liquor need not be
obeyed by me until September 1. After that
date I can sell nothing but wines In bottles to
guests at tables. The first order came weeks
ago and named July 1 as the date I was to
cease selling liquor. I wrote on June 25, tell
ing the general manager ftiat It would ruin
the business, and received no reply till yester
day. On July 1 I closed down all liquor sell
ing. I then had three barrels of wine, which
I had bought from the California Wine Asso
ciation, but having no use for It I sent it
back.
"I have now received a letter from Mr.
Kruttschnitt telling me that they have recon
sidered the order and that I can keep open
till September 1, but after that date I shall
sell only wine by the bottle to guests when
they are actually seated at table. This is all
nonsense and will, of course, mean that no
business can be done at the pier. That is all
there is in the letter."
After comparing the treatment he has
received from the company with the in
dulgence it metes out to Sacramento,
Redding, Castroville, Los Angeles and
San Jose it is not strange that Mr. Rooney
should imagine he has a grievance. When
the public read this article they also can
get some idea of the Kruttschnitt idea of
justice and the faith with which he keeps
his implied promises to the merchants
who got up the petition. The manner in
which Mr. Kruttschnitt has carried out
the discretion allowed him by the direct
ors it is expected will cause those gentle
men at their next meeting to give their
shifty general manager a bigger bump
than he could get on one of his own
"teacher specials."

SURGEON OF THE PHILADEL

-- â â â
Testifies to the Charges in the Com

Will Be Read During

â .'.:_.
Domestic fury and the strife of battle
are rapidly hardening the heart of Dr.
George A. Lung, surgeon of the United
States cruiser Philadelphia. Yesterday
Dr. Lung forgot his deeds of valor In Sa
moa, took the stand in Judge Murasky's
i court and prepared to defeat his wife in
a fight for divorce. How he will succeed
is a matter of speculation and his efforts
the matter of endless gossip.
When Judge Murasky called the action
of Lung vs. Lung, all preliminaries hav
ing been heretofore disposed of, the army
surgeon was called to the stand. He be
gan his story on the lines laid down in
his complaint charging his wife Eliza
beth with habitual Intemperance. His at

MRS. LUNG, the Defendant in
the Divorce Scandal..
Perryâ in their interrogations went Into
the various details of the alleged esca
pades in which Mrs. Lung was the prin
cipal, covering the various dates named
in the complaint, the places being from
Honolulu to Port Royal on the Eastern
coast. At the time of adjournment Dr.
Lung was still on the stand. , -_â 
The fun of the trial is expected when
the various depositions secured on behalf
of the plaintiff are read. In these the
testimony of the deponents is varied and
spicy. Mrs. Lung is charged with having
been guilty of Imbibing too much at /Ho
nolulu, with having disturbed the dignity
of all on board tne Philadelphia at that
place and ending up one day by driving
to the home of Mrs. A. S. Humphries, be
fore her marriage Miss Maria Afong, and
saying, addressing Mrs. Humphries, "You
are a d d flat nosed Chinawoman, by
G d!" Then come the depositions of
Charles H. Rockwell, connected with the
United States naval station at Port
Royal; John Surman of the United States
Marine Corps, Patrick ".Vail of Yemasee,
S. C. ; W. A. Mackenzie of Scroon Lake,
N. Y. and various other friends of the
plaintiff in all the evidence in a
measure sustaining the charges con
tained in the complaint. A letter ac
companying the deposition of Charles H.
Rockwell, however, is in Mrs. Lung's de
fense, and in it are the first direct
charges of misconduct on Dr. Lung's
art . . - -,
The letter was written by one Barnes
to Rockwell. Just who Barnes is has not
yet developed, but will before the end of
the trial. In this letter Barnes, In part,
says: "Last July Mrs. Lung joined her
husband on this coast and was requested
by him to visit at Honolulu, where the
Philadelphia was stationed. Dr. Lung
was in Honolulu about two weeks, when
stories began to come to Mrs. Lung that
her husband was associating with a noto
rious woman. When questioned Dr. Lung
admitted his association with the woman,
but put Mrs. Lung off, saying: '1 willr
tell you all about that some day.' /
"Mrs. Lung has had similar experiences
during the past nine years, which, to
gether with her husband's neglect and
cruelty, caused her to threaten to divorce
her husband on her return to the United
States.
"Shortly after her arrival here in San
Francisco Dr. Lung, fearing that she
would carry out her threat and anticipat
ing the consequences, immediately had
.papers served on her for intemperance.
Such a diabolical act has no parallel In
the history of the American navy. He
knows that he cannot prove her a drunk
ard by you, but has taken advantage of
some personal dislike he thinks you have
for her to help his case. I am thoroughly
satisfied that Mrs. Lung Is the victim of a
conspiracy. He also knows of a little con
flict with Mrs. Moore which he also wants
to take advantage of, well knowing, how
ever, she Is no longer at Port Royal. Mrs.
Lung is averse to airing her domestic
troubles in court and is prostrated with
grief.
"If Mrs. Lung is compelled to vindicate
herself she can, by showing the closet
door in the little room over the kitchen,
which shows the marks of her having to
force It open after being thrown into the
closet by her husband and nearly suf
focated. '
"I have tried to induce Mrs. Lung to let
f me Inform the department and ask for a
court of inquiry; but the poor woman
hopes for a reconciliation."
Manifestly Mrs. Lung's hope was falsely
placed, but. assisted by George D. Collins,
her counsel, she will fight to the end for
a judgment vindicating her on every
< charge. . . . -'.

LARGEST COURSING STAKE IN AMERICA.
DEER fIND DOVE SEASON OPENS TO-DflY.
GUNMEN MAY
SHOOT DEER
AT ANY TIME
SEASON OPENS TO-DAY
Game Is Said to Be Quite
Plentiful on the Preserves
and Elsewhere.
The open season for deer and doves for
the majority of the counties In California
will commence this morning. Notwith
stand. the depredations of market
hunters and others who have no respect
for the laws, and shoot out of season, the
prospects are considered excellent. From
the preserves of the Country Club, Olym
pic Gun Club and other places come re
ports of many leer having been seen. As
usual, the most enthusiastic of the gun
men have had a quiet survey of the field
already and believe they know just where
they can find a splendid buck without
much difficulty.
With the army of shooters that will be
in the field to-day the utmost caution will
be required to prevent accidents. The
majority of the sportsmen will be armed
with rifles of great carrying capacity and
care must be used in the handling of
them. The careful man never pulls the
trigger on a deer unless he sees the
ground behind his game and knows there
is no one in the line of his aim. The
ser.soned shooter is not likely to make
mistakes of judgment, but the Impetu
ous novice loses his self-possession when
a deer crosses his path.
For those who prefer the shotgun to
the rifle, the dove shooting will prove at
tractive. Last year the birds were con
fined to certain localities, but this season
they are distributed all over the country
and persons desiring sport will not have
far to go.
The open season for shooting in the
counties most frequented by sportsmen
from this city is fixed by law as fol
lows:.

WILL RACE FOR
WALLACE TROPHY
Yachtsmen of the California
Club to Hold Their An
nual Regatta Tc-Day.
m*&
The yachtsmen have been taking mat
ters easily since the recent holiday
cruises. Last Saturday and Sunday were
open dates on the programmes of all the
clubs, and the San Franciscos and Corin
thians have nothing scheduled for to-day
or to-morrow. Last Sunday several of
the Tiburon and Sausallto yachts went
out for short cruises, but the wind was
so light that some of them experienced
a little difficulty in making their moor
ings. H. R. Slmpklns' new yawl Tramon
tana went out cruising, and on Monday
was drawn up on the beach at Tiburon,
Walter S. Hobart.
where some work might be done upon
her.
Last Sunday Commodore T. L. Hill of
the San Francisco Yacht Club cruised ln
his sloop Cygnus to Corte Madera Creek.
There was a fair wind on the trip up,
but on the return the breeze was light
and fluky. Sausallto, however, was made
between 6 and 7 ln the evening. A. Suth
erland's sloop Catherine, the sloop Twi
light and E. C. Bartlett's yawl Frolic
were also out sailing. Secretary and Mrs.
E. C. Bartlett have been living aboard
the Frolic in the cove at Tiburon.
A meeting of the Belvedere committee
having the production of "A Night in
Venice" in charge-- was held recently In
the Corinthian clubhouse. A subcom
mittee was appointed to interview the
authorities of the California Northwest- .
crn Railway ana learn what support the
company will elve the project.
On the 29th Inst, the California yachts- j
men will pay a return visit to the Corin
thians at Tiburon, where a Corinthian
dinner will be spread under the superin
tendence of Port Captain John H. Keefe.
An entertainment will be given after-,
ward.
To-morrow the South Bay yachtsmen
will enjoy a barbecue at the drawbridge,
and the Callfornlas will hold their annual
regatta for the Wallace trophy. The
principal contestants in Class 2 will be
Commodore Allen M. Clay's sloop Pac
tolus. E. N. Walter and Laughland
Brothers' sloop Embla, H. S. Pratt's
yawl Idler and E. F. Sagar's sloop Edna.
In Class 1 the contestants will include
Secretary R. 1.. Eames* sloop Surf, L. S.
Sherman's sloop Royal, C. A. Tarnberg's
yawl Vega, Vice Commodore A. C. Lee's
sloop Surprise, G. turn Suden's sloop Re
glna, T. Turnbull's sloop Daisy, E. C.
Gales sloop Secret and the sloop U & I.
Last year the only two entries for the
Wallace trophy were the sloops Edna and
Embla, the former of which won by
12 minutes and 25 seconds, without cal
culating a small time allowance to which
she was entitled.
The trophy was presented to the Cali
fornia Yacht Club in 1?96 as a perpetual
challenge cup by W. C. Wallace, who
was at one time secretary of the club
and a keen yachtsman. In 1896 It was
won by the late E. A. yon Schmidt's cut
ter Whirlwind. In 1897 the sloop Embla
beat the sloop Edna by. 3 minutes on act
ual sailing time, but the Edna being en
titled to a time allowance, was declared
the winner by 31 seconds. The Edna is
the present holder of the trophy, and
bids fair to retain lt for another year,
as E. F. Sagar will spare no effort to
insure victory and will have the assist
ance of an excellent crew.
A CUP FOR
THE BEST OF
THE GOLFERS
SAN RAFAEL CLUB TROPHY
To Be Competed for Twice a
Year and Must Be Won
Three Times in All.
At present the San Rafael Golf Club is
manifesting much- more activity than any
other of the local clubs. The tournament
on the Ist, 3d, 4th and Bth of this month
comprised nine-hole medal play competi
tions for caddies, children and ladies and
an eighteen-hole. medal play contest for
men. There were also driving competi
tions for all four classes, an approaching
competition for men and mixed foursomes.
The ladles' driving contest took place last
Saturday afternoon after the conclusion
of the mixed foursomes, the following
ladies taking part: Mrs. R. G. Brown,
Mrs. J. J. Crooks, Mrs. F. H. Green, Mrs.
F. S. Johnson, Mrs. W. Bush, Mrs. Denis
Donohoe, Mrs. J. F. Burke. Miss Eleanor
Morrow, Miss C. Smedberg and Miss
Therese C. Morgan. Miss Eleanor Mor
row won with a drive of 270 feet, Mrs. R.
Oilman Brown being second with a drive
of 267 feet. Earlier in the afternoon Miss
Eleanor Morrow, playing In a foursome.
drove 125 yards, or 375 feet, from the
eighth tee, carrying the ditch, a feat not
often performed by ladles.
The council of the San Rafael Golf Club
will offer a trophy to be called the coun
cil cup to be played for twice a year, and
to become the property of the player who
wins it three times. The first match will
probably take place on Admission day.
To be eligible to take part in the contest
those who enter must play eighteen holes,
medal play, on the links within two weeks
before the match. They must accom
panied by a scorer, and the eight players
making the lowest scores will compete
on the following Saturday at eighteen
holes, match play, thus cutting the field
down to four competitors. On the day of
the match the semi-Ilnal round will be
held In the morning and the winners will
compete in the final round In the after
noon. The two players who get Into the
final round will thus have thirty-six holes
to play during the day. It Is. expected
that a ladles' cup will be offered under
'similar conditions, but the details have
not yet been arranged. Mrs. J. J. Crooks
will offer a prize for a ladies' competition
to take place on July 22.
Among the flourishing clubs In Southern
California chiefly devoted to golf is the
San Diego Country Club, which was re
organized and Incorporated early In 1898.
It nan a nine-hole course in the northeast
corner of the City Park, about p three
miles from the center of the city of San
Diego. The main or living room of â¢ the
clubhouse Is 40x22 feet and there are
two other rooms and a kitchen. The club
has between seventy and eighty active
members and about twenty non-resident
members. The clubhouse is comfortably
furnished and spacious enough for â¢ the
present needs of the members. The club
house stands on ground belonging to the
i club, ; just outside the limits of the City
Park. It faces the ninth green, so that
players can be seen from the clubhouse
at starting and finishing. With the aid
of a field glass the whole course may be
watched.
The course Is roughly triangular and
has various hazards, such as bunkers,
two ravines, several groups of rocks, a
network wire fence, and protecting the
ninth hole a precipitous ravine. The
ravine, known as "canon dv dlable." Is
the bete noir of novice and expert alike.
To reach the opposite side requires a clean
carry of 126 yards. As a rule ladles play
round the head of this ravine, but men
try to drive clear over it. The putting
greens are of rolled sand and adobe,
which makes an excellent substitute for
grass In San Diego's arid climate. They
are from fifty to seventy feet in diam
eter. /â V-i'.Yv :...._â¢

KNOCKED OUT IN TWELFTH
The Winner Now in Line to

Championship.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 14.â Tim Kearns of
Boston knocked the wind out of Jack
Daly of Wilmington in less than twelve
rounds before the Broadway Athletic Club
to-night. Kearns is now entitled to meet
the lightweight champion, Frank Erne of
Buffalo.
Kearns and Daly met for a twenty-flve
round bout at 137 pounds. Johnny White
was the referee, and the boys boxed strict
ly under Marquis of Queensberry rules.
Kearns persistently played for the body,
and each time he landed Daly winced and
jumped away. Daly tried to keep his op
ponent at arm's length with his left ana
attempted to throw his right across al
most simultaneously, but Kearns got in
side the leads or went to close quarters
to avoid Daly's right.
A hard right smash -from Daly cut
Kearns' left eye In the fourth round and
in the fifth a left jab split his right eye
brow. No sooner had the blood tricklea
down Kearns' face than the Boston lad
shot his left to Daly's right optic and cut
it just as severely. Daly went for bis
man with both hands, beating him to the
Hcor. Kearns got up at close quarters
and pummeled Daly hard and [ ffaff* f weak
ening the latter so that only the bell baled
him from going under _____._. _._..,*-
In the seventh Daly landed a right
swinging smash on Kearns' jaw. whij.li
dazed the hitter, and it looked as if the
Boston boy was done for but he recuper
ated wonderfully quick and fought out the
round with good judgment.
In the next few rounds Tim forced the
pace, forcing Daly to break ground con
tinually, and frequently the Delaware, lad
had to resort to clinching. Kearns always
boring in with both hands on the body.
Daly was very weak .-.a he came up for
the eleventh, and he got all the worst of
the argument. In the twelfth Kearns
bored ln with body blows and Daly was
forced to clinch repeatedly. Daly backed
Into his own corner, where Kearns threw
his left into the stomach and quickly
brought lt up with an uppercut on the
chin, flooring Daly. __ __
Jack fell flat on his back on the floor
of the ring, where he remained. Tim.2 or

LINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON, July 14.â 1 am told that Sec
retary Alger has asked the Presi
dent to make some public state
ment with a view to setting at rest the
reports that his resignation Is desired.
Mr. Alger told a friend to-day that the
President seemed to deprecate the at
tacks upon him, but declined to make
any public statement on the ground
that it would not be dignified for the
President to give newspapers inter
views. Mr. Alger expressed his disap
pointment over the President's failure
to publicly defend him, but his refusal
to do so does not seem to have changed
the Secretary's determination to either
force a direct request for his resigna
tion or to remain in the Cabinet until
the end of the present year, when he
has indicated that he would volun
tarily resign.
Senators and members of Congress,
who have been in the city during the
last few days, are almost unanimous in
their condemnation of the existing
state of affairs in connection with the
War Department. Naturally, they do
not care to speak publicly in condem
nation of the President or the Secre
tary of War, for they are here looking
tor favors, but privately they severely
criticise the Secretary for refusing to
go when he knews that he is not want
ed, either by the President or the
country; and they criticise the Presi
dent because he is not firm enough to
come out squarely and dismiss the man
they regard as responsible for many of
the blunders of the war, and utterly
incapable of meeting present emergen
cies.
These public men are also convinced
of the urgent necessity for putting a
man at the head of the War Depart
ment like Governor Roosevelt, who
would have the force and ability to pull
that department out of the rut it is in
and to get the army in shape for a vig
orous campaign to end the Philippine
war. Governor Roosevelt is the one
man above all others, in the opinion of
a large majority of public men with
whom I have talked, to meet the extra
ordinary condition which confronts the
country-

WHEN DEWEY WILL
REACH THIS COUNTRY
Writes He Will Be in New York
Harbor About the First
of October.
NEW YORK, July 14.â Admiral Dewey has written to his brother, Charles
Dewey, that he will arrive In New York harbor not later than October
li and" that he may be here a few days earlier than that date. This In
formation was given to-day to General Daniel Butterfield, chairman of
tl>e executive committee of the Dewey celebration by Edward Wllken Dewey,
a cousin of the admiral, who stated that Charles Dewey had given it to him in
a letter, in which was quoted the statement as to the date of his arrival.
General Butterfield at once communicated the news to Mayor Van Wyck.
The Mayor said that he expected to receive within a week a reply to the ca
blegram which he sent Admiral Dewey at Gibraltar.
Secret meetings are still held by the sub-committee on reception. After yes
terday's proceedings it was reported that invitations were to be extended to
the representatives of newspapers in all parts of the country to be the city's
guests during the reception.
The village of Three Oaks, Mich., has won the cannon which Admiral
Dewey sent from Manila for the Maine monument fund. The cannon was to
be given to the city or village making the largest contribution in proportion
to Its population. Three Oaks, with a population of from 800 to 1000 people,
raised $1122, representing more than $1 per capita.

to co home some time ago, but have had no
chance yet. They have the volunteers trapped
hero, and are going to hold them until they get
good and ready to let them go, which,' from
what we hear now, will be six months or more.
But as long as I keep in good health I won't

HEARING OF CHATHAM
ESTATE PROCEEDINGS
Date Will Be Fixed by the San Mateo
County Superior Court on
August 1.
REDWOOD CITY, July 14.â The attor
neys for Robert 8. and Maria E. Chatham
entered a vigorous protest yesterday to
the court setting the time for hearing
on the petition for distribution of Mi
randa E. Mills, the administratrix of the
estate of Robert Mills, deceased. On July
7 the administratrix filed her final ac
count and petition for distribution, pray
ing in the- latter for the distribution of
the estate to the rightful heirs. The
ground of objection argued yesterday to
the setting of the petition for hearing
was that there were already pending pro
ceedings to determine heirship, Instituted
by the Chathams, and that the court had
no jurisdiction over a petition for distri
bution until these had been determined.
The court thought the administratrix
had a right to have a time set, but inti
mated that this would not preclude it
from hearing the other proceeding flrst
should it desire to do so. The objections
were then withdrawn and both matters
will come up for hearing on August 1.
On that day, it is probable a day will
be fixed upon which either one or the
other of the proceedings will be finally
determined.

Legislature.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 14.â Daniel M.
Burns and Henry T. Gage entered Los
Angeles together this afternoon, although
the Governor of California, fearful per
haps of adverse criticism, did not accom
pany his friend and political factotum all
the way to the Arcade depot. The Gov
ernor instead left the train at River sta
tion, after having requested a reporter for
a local paper not to publish the fact that
he had returned to the city at all. The
Governor went to his Red Rover mine
near Acton on Wednesday and gave It
out at that time that he did not intend
to be back in Los Angeles before to-mor
row.
Burns was greeted here by his stead
fast confidante of the Senatorial dead
lock at Sacramento last winterâ Guy B.
Barhamâ no one else being at the depot
to meet him. Southern Pacific Superin
tendent John A. Muir and the "boss"
shook hands cordially as soon as the lat
ter stepped off the train. .
Burns insists his visit here at this time
has no political significance. It Is known,
however, that the object of the trip is to
lay out a plan of campaign at Catalina
Island for the proposed extra session of
the Legislature, which is to be called
should it be proved beyond doubt after
a thorough report from confidential
sources which have been at work on the
matter for weeks that the Candelarian
has sufficient votes to absolutely control
the Republican legislative caucus.
Catalina is an ideal place for political
intriguing, being without telephones, tele
graph wires or railroad facilities. Burns
will leave for the Island to-morrow. Gov
ernor Gage will join him early next week.
The two expect to spend a fortnight at
Catalina. In an interview this afternoon
Burns said:
I know nothing of an extra session of
the Legislature, nor of mv alleged ap
pointment as United States Senator.
Those are subjects with which the Gov
ernor of California might be thoroughly
conversant. You might interview him on
these, matters."
Senator C. M. Simpson of Pasadena was
among the earliest callers on Burns. He
Is seeking to have his former law partner
appointed Superior Judge ?of this county,
vice the late William HoveV, Clark. Burns
promised to use his influence with Gov
ernor Gage to have Simpson's request
gratified. The promise Is one of the col
onel's gold bricks, however, as the posi
tion Is known to be already promised
should Private Secretary W. I. Foley fin
ally decline lt, to a prominent lawyer
who has the backing of former United
States Senator Stephen M. White.
COLONIZATION SCHEME
TO REBUILD ESPARTO
George D. Fiske, a Member of the
. Syndicate, Interviewing East
ern Capitalists.
WOODLAND, July Esparto, ln the
western part of Yolo, first came Into ex
istence whfn the Vaca Valley Railroad
was extended from Winters to Rumsey.
It was expected that lt would develop
into the most Important town in Western !
Yolo. A syndicate of Woodland capital
ists constructed a fine hotel and several
pretentious store buildings, all of brick.
The soil Is fertile, the location desirable
and the buildings are all of a substantial
character; nevertheless the town has not
prospered, and for some time many of
the buildings have been unoccupied.
These conditions are said to be due to
conflicting Interests that all efforts so far
have failed to harmonize.
A few days ago George D. Flake, a
member of the syndicate, left for Boston.
It was announced that the trip was un
dertaken purely for rest and recreation.
It is now currently rumored that before
Mr. Fiske left he induced the bank, hotel !
and railroad companies to fix a price for â 
their property and that Mr. Fiske's real >
purpose In going to Boston was to in- ',
duce some capitalists "with whom he Is ;
personally acquainted to interest them
selves in the property. Rumor also - has
lt that if his mission is successful his
further plans contemplate the coloniza
tion of Esparto and a part of the sur
rounding country with Eastern people. If
these rumors are true, the people of Yolo j
County are much Interested in the sue- I
cess of Mr. Fiske's mission.

HER MEAGER SALARY HAS NOT

To Add to the Troubles of the Man

signed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 14.â The Lambardi
Grand Italian Opera Company is in trouble,
due to financial stringency and discord
among the artists from sunny Italy. Last
night the scenery, costumes and cash box
were attached, and the company was thus
prevented taking the early train this
morning for Los Angeles, where it is to
open an engagement to-morrow night.
The cash box was subsequently released,
but Constables Haley and Marshall still
have possession of costumes and scenery.
Efforts were made to get these, but with
little success.
The attachment was levied by Miss
Anita Domanlus, who Is very anxious to
obtain $265, which she claims Is due her
from Manager Mario Lambardi for salary.
Suit for this amount was commenced in
Justice Wallace's court.
The plaintiff in the case Is one of the
I leading singers, being named in every
j publication of the cast as one of the
contralto voices. She is a very large
young woman, weighing about 200 pounds,
i and ln her native tongue she utters
I weighty protests, accompanied with lively
; gesticulations, in her version of the man
ner in which she has been treated by her
; employer, Mario Lambardi.
Miss Domanius sued to recover $265 that
i was alleged to be due her partly upon a
: promissory note and partly for salary for
â¢' recent services.' The note was issued on
' September 22 of last year for $348. pay
i able in two weeks. By a coincidence the
transaction wr.s begun during an engage
ment of the company in San Jose, Costa
I Rica, and the note was sued upon at the
namesake of that town, San Jose in Call-
fornia.
It is alleged that only on two occasions
were any payments made on the note,
once $70 and $&0 on another occasion. This
makes $228 still due, and the remainder
of the amount sued for, $37, was alleged
to be for salary for services In the com
pany from June 1 to July 13. Although
she was one of the leading singers it
seems that the European scale of wages
was still in force and Miss Domanius re
ceived only $2 a day, which was the limit
of her salary contract entered into a num
ber of months ago. V:
The note upon which the attachment
suit was brought is in the Spanish lan
guage, which Is the langauge of legal doc
uments in Costa Rica. vc â¢
A fight upon technical grounds has been
begun against the attachment suit. It was
claimed by Manager Lambardi that the
costumes did not belong to him, but that
the brilliant spangled attire in which his
singers appeared in the various operas in
their repertoire were borrowed plumes, as
it were. It was claimed that they did
not belong to the company, but were sim
i ply rented under a contract from a cos
i turner, and therefore could not be levied
1 upon for a debt contracted by Manager
; Lambardi. ."- '--'-. ; ; - .
It is reported that besides his troubles
1 with his leading contralto singer Impre
sario Lambardi is minus three other war
blersâVictoria Repetto. diva; Joseph Fer
rari, barytone, and.Baldo Travaglini. La
Repetto and Ferrari have already quit the
company, and Travaglini will leave in fif
teen days. The trouble with these singers
Is said to be not on account of a delin
quency to be not on account a delin
iey In the payment of salaries, but
an affair of honor. Lulgl Bergami, the
stage manager, it Is said, addressed
Mademoiselle Repetto in such a fashion
that the lady immediately resigned, and
the barytone threw down his music roll
nnd quit. Travaglini. . too, was enraged,
but, unfortunately, the basso had given
his word of honorto the management that,
money or no money, he would stay by
him for fifteen days more, and the singer
would not break his word.

CONCESSIONARIES
State Department Looks
Out for Americans.

TROUBLES OF AMERICAN-CHINA
COMPANY.
â¦
Representatives of the British Gov
ernment Will Not Be Con
sulted in the Mat-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW -YORK, July 14.â Herald's
Washington correspondent says: Prompt
action has been taken by the State De
partment to protect concessions granted
to the American China Development Com
pany in the Celestial empire.
As a result of representations made to
Secretary Hay to-day by W. B. Parsons,
representing the company, and discussion
of the matter by the President and the
Secretary of State, Instructions have been
given to Minister Conger at Peking to use
his good offices in behalf of the company.
He will not act with the British repre
sentative in any way.
â¢ Concerning the action taken by this
Government and its views on the subject
of an alliance with the British Govern
ment to preserve the interest of private
companies, an authoritative statement
was made to-day.
The American China Development Com
pany having represented to the Depart
ment of State that there was danger of
its Interests being damaged by interfer
ence with its vested rights in China and
by violation of its contracts entered into
with the Chinese Government, the Amer
ican Minister In Peking has been instruct
eu to use his good offices in all proper
ways in behalf of the <-mpany and to
prevent its spoliation or injury to its in
terests.
There is no foundation whatever for the
report that this action Is taken In con
currence with that of the. British Gov
ernment. There has been no communica
tion between the two governments in re
gard to the matter and no joint action has
been asked for by the company and none
has been recommended. - The traditional
policy of the State Department has been
pursued in this as in other cases, tne
American diplomatic representative being
charged to assist every American interest
in the countries to which they are ac
credited. The American China Develop
ment Company is already Indebted to the
State Department for assistance. When
Colonel Denby was Minister to China he
received Instructions from Secretary Ol
ney, which were Indorsed by the present
administration,' stating that while he must
not assume, in the name of the Govern
ment, any responsibility for or guaranty
of any American commercial or industrial
enterprise trying to establish itself in
China, he should use his personal and
official Influence and lend all proper coun
tenance to secure to reputable represen
tatives of such concerns the same facili
ties for submitting proposals, tending
bids and obtaining contracts as are en
joyed by any other foreign commercial
enterprise in the country.
. Colonel Denby thereupon made known
to. the Yamen that while he was not au
thorized to demand of the Chinese Gov
ernment contracts to build railroads or
do any other work, he felt it his duty
to see that the rights of his compatriots
should be protected.
The Minister went on to say that he
understood that the contract for building
the Hankow-Peking line had been actually
let to Americansâ preliminary contract
having been entered Into with we Ameri
can China Development Company, which
was composed of men worth several hun
dred million taelsâ but that now it had
been represented that the Chinese Gov
ernment was not disposed to â¢ treat the
company fairly. He demanded that they
contract with the company for the con
struction of the line. Secretary Sherman,
who soon afterward succeeded Olney, ap
proved Colonel Denby's action, but di
rected him to be cautious in giving what
might be understood as this Government's
indorsement of the financial standing of
persons seeking contracts with that of
China.
"In the present case," he said, "It ap
pears from your dispatch that you
told the Tsung Ll Yamen that the Ameri
can China Development Company was
composed of men who were worth sev
eral hundred million taels. The depart
ment understands* that the said company
Is a limited liability company, with a very
small capital. The individual financial
standing of the various persons compos
ing the company has consequently little
to do with the matter." -
ASKS FOR PERMISSION
TO PAY THE CLAIMS
Accounting Filed by the Administra
trix of A. Page Brown's \
Estate. "
REDWOOD CITY, July 14.â Lucy Pryon
Brown yesterday filed her account as ad
ministratrix of the estate of A. Page
Brown. The' estate consists of personal
property and cash valued at $38,790 74 and
a homestead appraised at $5000.
One Item in the account, over which
there has been considerable litigation,
was that of $25,000, a sum received by the
administratrix on a life Insurance policy
from the New York Life Insurance Com
pany. Some time ago the administratrix
petitioned the court to set apart to her
about $20,000 of this policy, claiming it as
her separate estate. This the court re
fused to do, on the ground that the prem
ium on the policy amounted to over $500.
The matter was appealed to the Supreme

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July There was a short j
period of strength in some stocks this morning, j
but it was insufficient to overcome the sagging i
tendency in the general market. The weakness ;
of Brooklyn Transit coming on the dull market j
emphasized the reactionary tendency. The i
main cause of the general weakness was the j
Increasing fear that money difficulties abroad j
would cause future trouble _for the New York
money market and would take out gold as soon !
as the local rate for money fell to a point
where the London rate would prove attractive, j
Rumors were abroad all day that a shipment ,
of gold was contemplated for to-morrow's
steamer, but up to the close none had been
announced. Money worked easier here, call loans '
ranging from 3 to 5 per cent* The call rate to
London went to 3% per cent and discount was
held at the Bank of England's minimum rate
of 3% per cent. London sold moderately in New
York, but gave good support to a few favorites
ln the American department of its own market.
There was no quotable change in sterling ex
change rates, but sight bills showed a harden
ing tendency, while the sixty days' bills were
easy. Not so much confidence Is felt ln a
favorable bank statement for to-morrow. These
considerations prompted a pause in the buy
ing movement In stocks end the early strength
In the Southwestern group. The trunk lines
and Northern Pacific gave way in the after
noon to decidedly lower prices. The talk of
crop damage in the Northwest ' affected the
grangers unfavorably in the late trading.
Losses from the top point ln many active rail
road stocks ranged from 1 to 2 points. North
ern Pacific was marked up above last night's
level in the final dealings, though it was little
affected during the day by the report of an
amicable agreement with Great Northern inter
ests. Chicago Terminal was strong on the re
ported sale to the Alton syndicate. Brooklyn
Transit was weak throughout on the prospects
of a strike and closed at the lowest, 2% below
last night. The early strength in Sugar gave
â way to weakness and Rubber dropped 2%, with
a subsequent partial recovery. Manhattan was
marked up to 120 at one time on the theory
that a surface railroad strike would add to its
business. Missouri Pacific closed a point lower
on the day. A number of specialties showed
some strength during the d_ry, among them
Cotton Oil, National Biscuit preferred, Tin
Plate, Anaconda and Steel and Wire. New
York Airbrake gained S% points.
The bond market was dull and prices yielded
with the weakness ' In stocks. Total sales, par
value, $3,510,000. United States 3s advanced %
In the bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day amounted to
241,0*5 shares. including: American Steel, 3000;

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 14.â Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here opened quiet and steady,
but were checked by dearer money and appre
hension of friction in Cape Colony over, the
â¢ Transvaal troubles. Americans were firm
throughout. There was little movement in them
except for a spurt in Northern Pacific in the
hope of a larger dividend. Anaconda, 11%.

LONDON'S FINANCIAL CONDITION.
LONDON. July 14.â Press Association to
day sent out the following statement," which
' is believed to be accurate:
"Business in financial circles is considerably
checked, owing to a certain anxiety as to the
future and the remarkable reticence maintained
in all quarters, the scarcity of money and the
recent large sales of consols. A block of Â£1,000,
--000 is reported to have been sold Wednesday. To
add to the apprehension this is the season when
the provinces require mere money than usual
In connection with the activity of trade. But,
nevertheless, bankers are keeping large sur
plus balances for emergency purposes. It is
well known that a considerable amount of Ger
man bills are held here at speculation rates
and that a large amount of credits are on a
Berlin firm which recently failed."
BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, July Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say:
A moderate volume of transactions, attended
by a certain degree of strength in quotations,
were the leading features of the speculative
situation during the present week. What is
termed midsummer dullness has its customary
effect in restricting the market, and the com
parative firmness of call loans tended to check
both manipulation on. any large scale or the
growth of public Interest. While America^
stocks have been a feature in London, the un
settled speculative position there, due to the
troubles ln South Africa and the advance of
interest rates, has not been without a certain
effect on financial sentiment here. The re
markable fall in the price of British consols,
which on Tuesday sold at 106%, a drop of 5%
points from the highest quotation of the year,
could not fall to attract notice, though lt
seemed due to local causes and failed to exer- >
else a positively disturbing effect on general
speculation. London, however, sold our se
curities to a certain extent, partly for the rea
sons detailed above and partly because of dis
appointment, in which our own market shared,
at the failure of last week's rumors of .fresh
Vanderbllt deals to materialize and of the de
nial that there was any more than friendly
negotiations on foot between the management
of the New York Central and Pennsylvania
companies. The most effective factor was the
favorable crop report published on Monday, and
which, supplemented by good accounts of
weather and other accounts in the West, by a
heavy movement of grain on the railroads and
by other indications that railroad traffic and
earnings will be well maintained, had created
a bullish feeling on the Granger and South
western stocks. . The subsidence of reports of
anticipated labor disturbances also had an In
fluence, though on Thursday Brooklyn Rapid
Transit declined on renewed rumors, of troubles
of that character. A slight effect was also pro
duced on prices by the news that one of the
largest of American life insurance corporations
had decided to dispose of Its holdings of stocks,
presumably to comply with the German law
and pave the way for a readmlsslon to that
country. . It was, .however, soon appreciated
that the action in question was to be dis
tributed over a series of years and could have
no Immediate or serious effect on the market. >
BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK. July Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say:
New features in the general trade situation
this week are of an almost uniformly favor
able character. So rare, indeed, are the dis
turbing features as to necessitate search to
locate them. Additional statistics of past trade
movements received are certainly of 'an en
couraging nature, foremost among these being
exceptionally good ' railroad earnings reported
for June and the flrst half of the year and
ascertained totals of an enormous export trade,
nearly equal to the phenomenal business of the
preceding fiscal year. The reports of railroad
receiverships for the first half of' the year
bear a striking resemblance to the list of busi
ness mortalities inasmuch as they are the
smallest in number reported since receiverships,
first became prominent. Among current news
features might be mentioned the quite favor
able crop report of the Agricultural Depart
ment, which, while confirming early advices of
a moderate yield of winter wheat and therefore
of a small aggregate crop than that gathered
last year (admitted, however, to have been
largely underestimated), points to a large acre
age ln corn and conditions, which, â if main
tained, would easily result ln a crop in excess
of 2,000,000,000 bushels. Late unfavorable re
ports from Russia point to a still greater dim
inution of crop yields ln that country this year.
The official French crop estimates have .also
been whittled down and the outlook seems to
favor the probability that Europe will buy.
nearly as much wheat ln America as it did in
the last fiscal year, when, it might be "added,
exports exceeded the totals of the boom year
1897-98. In Industrial lines, the outlook Is a
promising one. The settlement of the coal
miners' strike .In Pennsylvania, and of the
tin-plate workers' dispute, bid fair to result
in nearly 60,000 men resuming work, after the
summer shut down. A number of wage in
creases are also among the week's develop
ments. The iron-blast furnace for July 1,
points to an unprecedented current weekly pro
duction, but available stocks of pigiron arc
down to less than one week's supply. From. sev
eral centers of industrial activity come reports
of scarcity of labor, militating against even
more pronounced activity. Iron and steel
while reflecting the summer quietness to some
extent in the East, are quite active in demand
at the West and some heavy sales are | re
ported from Chicago, with further price ad
vances in structural material. . . __- . â¢ â¢
Bessemer pig Is now slightly more than dou
ble what it. was one year ago. Reports are
current that final arrangements for booking a
large quantity of foreign business have been
closed. The price situation is not a strong one,
wheat and coffee, alone of all the staples, being
lower on the week and the former only frac
tionally so, owing to large receipts at the
West and the check to export demand caused
by reaction from the price reached some time
ago. . - . :

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 15, 1899.
DUN'S REVIEW J OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, July 14.â G. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
Because every prospect pleases it Ib the right
time to watch most closely for signs of trouble.
But it is not easy to find them when the vol
ume of business is 63.7 per cent larger than last
year and 75.5 larger than in 1592, the best of
all years except the last, or when failures con
tinue the smallest ever known, or when the
exports of staples begin to improve materially,
or when railroad business is by far the best
ever known, , or .when . New York bankers ap
pear in international operations, listening to
a Russian inquiry and undertaking a Mexican
loan. Even then the industrial . disputes inci
dent to the season cause less trouble than
usual, the largest of them having been settled
Thursday by the tin plate company. The Bank
of England finds it difficult to borrow more
from this side and frankly raises its rate, while
this country begins to ship fresh crops for
which Europe will run Into debt.
iron production in the first. week of July was
263.363 tons, for the past two weeks, less, be
cause a strike on July 1 closed seven Shenango
furnaces producing 1200 tons dally, though it
is expected to end to-day, and several other
furnaces have begun producing this month.
The increase of 9301 tons weekly in June, with
a decrease of 80.400 tons in unsold stocks
not of the great steel companies, implies a pro
duction of about 1.128.690 tons in June. Con
sumption would be 1.209,090 tons, and In the
half year 6,844,215, but for the fact that steel
makers have stocked heavily against orders
running through most of the year, drawing
from outside supplies, so that consumption
proves only 6,700,000 tons, or even lass. Prices
are climbing, but only for the trifling surplus
not covered by contracts, so that quotations
represent but an insignificant part for the
actual business. It is of more importance that
new orders, though many, seem no longer equal
to the weekly output except in a few branches,
while furnaces and other works practically
I abandoned for many years are being started
again. .-.-*â -
Copper Is a shade weaker at 18% c for lake.
Government reporting the output in 1898 as
526.375,391 pounds. 'â â -'_ -
Tin Is strong, with London speculation at
J2B 25, and lead Is advanced by the smelter
company to J4 55. The largest shipments of
boots and shoes in any year for the season,
193.080 cases in two weeks, greater by 17.4 per
cent than last year, 6.6 per cent than in 1897
and 29.4 per cent than in 1892. result from very
extensive pressure to anticipate orders for Au
gust or September distribution far exceeding
expectations. Hemlock sole leather sells
largely, but some kinds slowly, with slightly
yielding prices.
Though cotton Is steady in spite of Texas
floods at 6.19 c, and the general demand for
cotton goods la full and sustains prices, a re
duction of %c in some fancy prints Is reported.
Larger distribution is expected this month and
the export demand increases.
In wool a great speculation Is ln progress,
sales in two weeks reaching 22.261.100 pounds,
against 24,672,800 in 1898. when buying was to
anticipate new duties. It Is worth noticing that
no purchases by manufacturers are mentioned,
save one foe 400 pounds, though there Is much
calculation that "the manufacturers must buy"
at any price asked. Western frenzies sometimes
make Eastern markets, but as a rule con
sumers make prices ln the end.
In sharp contrast with official and other,
wheat reports are the recorded receipts at
Western points. 8,055,116 bushels In two weeks,
against 1,471.739 last year. It Is not strange
that prices have declined l%c. and exports,
flour Included, were from Atlantic ports In July
thus far 4,1.5,914 bushels, against 4,063,312 last
year and from Pacific ports 1,110,485, against
601.100 last year, besides 505,585 this year from
other ports.
Failures for the week have been 169 In the
United States, against 215 last year, and 24 in
Canada, against 23 last year.

and the lack of cash demand. s. There was no
Paris market on account of the holiday, and
the weather in Germany and France .was . re

set buying against puts and covering by
shorts, which caused a temporary reaction in
September to 73% c, but the influence of the
heavy Baltic receipts and the absence of news
of a decided bullish character soon Imparted
heaviness. to the market, which lasted for the

and confined almost entirely to small scalpers.

WILL NOT BE
CONTROLLED BY
BURNS' COHORTS
Republicans Must Be
Reorganized.
â Â«. â
ALAMEDA COUNTY IS DIVIDED
â â
WILL NOT TOLERATE MORE
RAILROAD SCANDALS.
â¦
There Appears to Be No Disposition
on the Part of the Leaders to
Undertake the Prelim
inary Work.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. July 14.
The future of the Republican party in
this county is very much in doubt. Al
though several other counties are resur
recting their clubs and various Republi
can organizations, the party In Alameda
County is so rent asunder that no one
cares to make the flrst move.
There is the element committed to and
owned by the Burns-McLaughlin and oth
er railroad interests, and there Is the
clean non-railroad element represented
by the Republicans who are most active
in city politics In Oakland. The majority
of the county politicians as represented
at the county buildings are Burns men.
and during and since the last election
they have made no secret of their alle
giance. The Howard Wright scandal
shattered much of the prestige and all
of the remnant of respectability that
hung around the Burns element, and
those who were not elected to office have
since been rewarded by Burns through
the Governor with soft snaps. The most
prominent of these is Charley Spear, who,
being beaten for County Recorder by an
anti-Burns man, was made a port war
den. The balance of them have been
taken care of one way or another by the
Supervisors.
The anti-Burns men have full control
of the city government and recent devel
opments would make it appear that they
are still led by Dr. Pardee, who. although
appointed Regent of the State University
by the Governor, in no way does that
solitary appointment show any connec
tion with Dan Burns. Recently commu
nication was had with Los Angeles Re
publican leaders and it was learned that
they were deciding to organize for the
national campaign upon an anti-Burns-
McLaughlin basis. In Alameda County
this same programme will undoubtedly be
carried out, although it Is whispered that
the Burns men are even now trying to

the election of- United States Senator be
deferred until the next regular session of

blymen and Senators from this county

tore they are elected.
"This county is not a stamping ground
for Dan Burns and his flock." said an
Alameda Republican leader this after
noon. "The most disgraceful incident in
the history of Republicanism in Califor
nia was the petty exhibition of small poli
tics made by Chairman McLaughlin of
the State Central Committee at Sacra
mento last spring. . Who ever heard of a
mail in such an important position stulti
fying his office and the party by opening
State headquarters in the interests of any
particular candidate and especially such
a' candidate and such a party wrecker as
Uan Burns? Alameda County will get to
rether and lay the foundation of a sound
Republican movement that will overthrow
this railroad dictatorship, and the sooner
tve start the better. Otherwise this great
Republican county will make an unpleas
ant exhibition In 1900."

MUSTER IN LADIES
ORGANIZATION OF A NEW LO
CAL MILITARY SOCIETY.
The Wives and Daughters of United
States Veterans Band Together
for Friendship, Loyalty
and Charity.
Last Tuesday evening a new society was
.rganized in this city in Red Men's build
ing on Post street. It is to be known as
Aid No. 3 of the Ladles* Aid Society, an
urbanization which is quite large in the
East. The organization is the official
auxiliary of the Sons of Veterans and is
.omposed of wives and daughters of vet
erans. It Is strictly a patriotic organiza
tion, wth principles and objects similar
to those of the Sons of Veterans. The
new aid was mustered in by the officers
of Fair Oaks Camp No. 15, and Is the
third in the State of California, No. 1
Deing at Los Angeles and No. 2 at Pasa
-sena. The society in this city was Insti
tuted with thirty members, but the char
ter -was not closed, as lt Is expected that
it the next meeting twenty-five more will
be mustered in. The mustering officer
tvas Captain Frank R. Handley, detailed
for that purpose by Mrs. E. H. P. Davis
_f Washington. D.. C, the national presi
dent. He conducted the ceremony in a
most satisfactory manner, making im
pressive the lessons of friendship, loyalty
md charity.
In recognition of services rendered in the
organization of the aid, Mrs. Laura J. j
Handley was unanimously chosen past j
president. The other officers are: Miss :
Lillian M. Hembrie. president; Mrs. Julia !
Lmhem vice president; Miss Lou Watson,
lecretary ; MiSS Lulu Ellis, treasurer; Mrs.
Laura E. George, chaplain; Miss Mac
Dunn, right guide; Miss Anna Watson,
Â»ft guide; Miss Emma Boltz, sentinel;
Mrs. Lalra Handley, Mrs. Esther Dunn
md Mrs. D. B. Plymire, trustees. Mrs.
Hen-brie the president, is well qualified
for her new position, having been presi

eral literary societies. Many of the mem- i
bers for a year or more maintained an
.rganization in this city called the Ladies

HIS CAMPAIGN
SLOGAN, FOR A
PUBLIC MORGUE
Mehrmann Will Stand
by Promises.
â â¦ â
SAYS "IT'S ALL POLITICS"
â â
WILL SOON EXPRESS HIS PRI
VATE OPINION PUBLICLY.
â¦
Effect of the Resolution That Ma
terially Curtailed Emoluments
of Office May Result Dis
astrously.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 14.
"It's all politics!"
That and nothing else, declares Coroner
Mehrmann, is the pivot upon which the
agitation over establishing a public
morgue is revolving. The question is
reaching an acute stage, and on next
Monday, the Coroner threatens, he will
deliver a twenty-five-page typewritten ti
rade, expressing publicly before the Board
of Supervisors his private opinion of the
hoard's action in adopting resolutions, by
the tenor of which the emoluments of his
office are curtailed. He declares the re
duction is such that he may yet be com
pelled to take up his campaign slogan,
"For a Public Morgue"; because the
owner of the present Morgue quarters
will find it a losing proposition to ac
commodate the county at the "reduced
price list" as fixed by the Supervisors.
By resolution the board lias precluded
the Coroner from henceforth charging $5 I
each for the removal of bodies, or i
$2 each for interments, except where the
remains handled are those of an indigent.
On an average of ei__bt out of eighty-four
thus far have been indigent cases, or at I
best two out of twenty cases. Thus,
where the Coroner would receive 540 for I
twenty interments at $2 each and $100 for
removing twenty bodies, he will re- |
ceive but $4 in the first instance and $10 j
in the removal cases.
"The Supervisors cannot get even with
me on the public Morgue proposition,"
said Coroner Mehrmann to-day, "because
that is lust what I want. It is what I
promised the people of Alameda County
when conducting my campaign, and now
the action of the Supervisors is simply
assisting me in executing my promise.
"If the revenue from my office will no
longer warrant me In keeping the Morgue
at Albert Brown's place on Thirteenth
street, why, as a county onicer, 1 will
have to go before the Supervisors and
ask them to provide me with a Morgue.
When I arranged for the Morgue at
Brown's, the institution was put ln first
class shape and many improvements were
made at a considerable expense to Mr.
Brown; but If my fees are so curtailed
that Brown can no longer receive a fair
revenue on his investment and current
expenses of the Morgue, it is not likely
that he will care to have the Morgue at
his place any longer.
"Tne question then resolves Itself,
What am I to do? Why, under the opin
ion of District Attorney Allen, it devolves
upon the Supervisors to provide a suita
ble Morgue. And if this is done, why
who is the loser? Not I, for it won't cost
me a cent more; nor Brown, for it would
not pay him to keep the Morgue. But
the county would be the loser, for where:
lt now costs $43 per month it will then
cost at least $300.
"However, 1 am weary of this rumpus,
though 1 will yet have a word to say
before the board next Monday. Then I
will tell what 1 think of its action in lay
ing the matter over at the last meeting
while I was present, and afterward dis
posing of it when 1 was not present."
RISKED HIS LIFE TO
SAVE A DROWNING BOY
OAKLAND, July 14.â John Simpson, <_
lumberman whose sixty-five years of
active life have left him gray-haired and
bent, performed an act of heroism yes
terday that would do credit to one many
years his junior. Willie Miller, a 10-year
old noy residing on Fourth street, while
fishing off the city's wharf near Webster
street, lost his balance and fell into the
estuary.
His screams for help attracted Simp
son's attention, and there being no one
else in the vicinity to rescue the drowning
boy the aged lumberman leaped into the
water, reaching the boy just as he was
about tc sink for the last time. Simpson
succeeded in landing the lad safely and
was loudly cheered by the throng that
had gathered at the wharf. The lumber
man, however, had a very narrow escape
from drowning.
the order on this coast has been thus
honored.
A systematic effort is to be made to
Increase the membership of the order,
and to that end the following named have
been chosen an organization committee:
Special Aid Handley, Senior Vice Com
mander A. G. Bennett of San Jose. Junior
Vice Commander Edward M. Selby of
Ventura, Mustering Officer James H.
Cambell of Pasadena and Adjutant W.
G. Luckhardt of San Francisco. The
committee has issued from .headquarters
at 71 Stevenson street in this city a neat
six-page folder explanatory of the Sons
of Veterans and the principles and ob
jects of the organization. The members
of the Grand Army posts. Woman's Re

Circles are to be interested in this move-
ment.
Last week Captain A. F. Dill, depart

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 15, 1599.
ALAMEDA COUNTY
BRAVE LOVERS
RESPECT DUTY
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, 908 Broadway, July 14.
THERE is always romance in war. And Oakland claims its share of all
romances.
Lieutenant Arthur Ferguson, one of the heroes of Funston's' brigade,
should at this time have been leading to the altar one of the noblest
young ladies of Alameda County. Many months ago young Ferguson,
not then a lieutenant, but a plain, manly volunteer, became engaged to
Miss Annie Christenson of Alameda. At the call to arms, which was issued
on the 27th of last October, Arthur Ferguson instantly obeyed, and was a few
days later on his way to Manila. The engagement was kept a secret until
such time as he should return with honors. The time is now due, but owing
to unusual bravery young Ferguson has been promoted to be second lieuten
ant in Colonel Funston's new regiment, and may remain In the Philippines for
another year.
Lieutenant Ferguson has obtained much distinction during the war. In the
special Call-Herald dispatches from Manila last April Ferguson is mentioned
as the corporal of Company E of the Kansas Volunteers. The dispatch says:
The American and insurgent lines were separated only by the width of the river â
100 yards. There was a constant scattering fire. When night came yesterday
Colonel Funston made a daring attempt to surprise the Insurgents. Ills' plan was
to lead fifteen men across the bridge under cover of darkness nnd surprise and at
tack the lnpurjr?n_*. The bridge Is long and much exposed. Colonel Funston sent
Corporal Ferguson of Company E of the Kansas Volunteers to reconnoiter the
bridge. The corporal stripped and crawled along the girders to within twenty feet
of the opposite shore, anl an Insurgent sentry approached .within ten feet of him
without discovering his presence. .:â¢â -"
Ferguson reported that the plan was impracticable, because, the rails having
been removed, walking would be dangerous and the wounded would fall into the
river. In other respects than the loss of the rails the bridge was intact.
Colonel Funeton then decided to lead 120 men across the river a mile to the
westward and enfilade the insurgents.
For this act of bravery Corporal Ferguson was offered the lieutenancy in
Colonel Funston's regiment, with a salary of $1400 per year. The matter was
so placed before him by the colonel that he decided to accept, with the con
sent of Miss Christenson, who at once approved of her soldier-lover's ambi
tion. â¢./.'.
In his letters Ferguson, who has also been acting as correspondent for a
Chicago newspaper, tells of many narrow escapes, one of which Is tersely nar
rated as follows: "So far I have got through safely, and trust I will have the
same good luck during the remainder of the campaign. I got a scratch over
the temple in one of the fights and had a hole shot through my canteen at Ca
lumplt. An inch to the right in either case, and I should not have written this
letter."
CAPTAIN GRAHAM IS
ENTIRELY VINDICATED
HE IS ADMITTED TO BE AN
IDEAL SON-IN-LAW.
Acquitted of ths Charge. of Attempt
ing to Parboil His Aged
Mother-in-Law.
ALAMEDA, July 14.â Captain Daniel
Graham, who has been made famous from
Siskiyou to San Diego as the only man
on record who had nerve enough to defy
his mother-in-law, has been vindicated.
The charge of parboiling the old lady,
which has been hanging over the aged
captain's head for some weeks, has been
swept away and he has been purged of
any such heinous offense. This morning
Captain Graham was a martyr; this even
ing he is a hero. He is moreâ has been
elevated to the high plane of being a
perfect son-in-law.
All this decided change in the trend of
affairs was brought about by Mrs. Mar
garet Wall, the mother-in-law, who told
Judge St. Sure, when she applied for a
warrant, that she had been parboiled by
the captain and subjected to the further
indignity of being drenched by a well
directed stream from the garden hose.
The captain's trial took place this morn
ing before Recorder St. Sure and a jury.
Many celebrities occupied the Jury box.

CAKEWALK CARNIVAL.
Formal Opening This Evening nt

The reception and banquet tendered to
the Oregon soldier boys at the Mechanics'
Pavilion somewhat upset the prepara

be in readiness for to-night.
The grand entree pageant, illustrating
among the most conspicuous. Captain
William Simpson, who commanded Com
pany G while it was stationed at Van
couver Barracks, represented the defend
ant. Timothy O'Halloran and Deputy
District Attorney Samuels conducted the
prosecution.
The mother-in-law in the case was the,
only witness examined. Her daughter.
Mary Wall, a grlm-visaged spinster, tried
to do the talking for the old lady, but
Judge, St. Sure silenced her in the first
round. The aged Mrs. Wall, who Is crawl
ing close on to four score years, had her
sanity questioned the flrst thing by tne at
torney for the defense. She seemed to
be oblivious of the meaning of the legal
wrangle between the attorneys and was
finally allowed to proceed with her story
of torture. . _ . "
A half-dozen sentences, and the Judge,
jury and attorneys were satisfied that
Captain Graham was more sinned against
than sinner. Mrs. Graham frankly ad
mitted that he had never maltreated her.
and then wandered into an incoherent
statement about money that had taken
flight until the phantom-winged dollars
buzzed around her head like kissing bugs,
and the charges were dismissed without
argument.
It was the captain's money that brought
the old lady and her daughter Mary from
Ireland about eleven years ago. They
were provided for at the Graham home,
1430 Ninth street. Alameda, until Mary's
conduct became, so obnoxious to the cap
tain and his wife that they forced her to
live elsewhere. They continued to take
care of Mrs. Wall until a few weeks ago,
when she displayed an ungovernable tem
per and threatened bodily harm to Mrs.
Graham. Then she went to her daughter
Mary in San Francisco, and the pair had
Graham and his wife arrested on the
charges of cruelty which fell flat to-day.
Mrs. Wall stated on the stand that Cap

the greatest kindness and was an ideal
son-in-law.

The Mayor Has Not Yet Completed
His Investigation Into the
Conduct of Mr. Miller and
His Department.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 14.
The dove Is now sitting on the handle
of the hatchet at the City Hall, the dan
gerous part of the weapon being almost
buried.
The tremendous tempest that has
waged in a teapot for over a month has
calmed down and Dr. Pardee and Mayor
Snow are good friends. Strange to say.
they declare that they have always beer,
good friends and that the cause of all the
trouble has been certain wicked newspa
per men, who seem to have taken a de
light in goading the doctor and the Mayor
to fighting.
In view of the beautiful peace that is
now prophesied in the city government,
it is useless to speculate on the turbulent
past. Dr. Pardee says that he is positive
the Mayor promised to vote for Mr. Miller
and the Mayor does not say he did not
make such a promise, but says that if
he did he has forgotten it. It is very
natural that Mr. Snow in the heat of a
very bitter campaign may have made re
marks which he has since forgotten, but
such an incident will not be permitted to
break the harmonious relations existing
between the city government and those
ardent Republicans who worked for the
success of the ticket last March.
Mayor Snow has never said that he
will not vote for Mr. Miller and it is on
record that two weeks ago at a meeting
of the board he did say that when the
Miller resolution came up again he might
be ready to act favorably upon it. There
are many things in the Street Superin
tendent's department which can be ad
justed for their betterment, and the
Mayor, pursuing the policy he adopted
when he flrst took office, is making a
thorough investigation of the street de
partment before he decides upon any
action. Naturally he would not be
"Jammed" into voting for Mr. Miller un
til he is ready to do so, but there is no
doubt that Mr. Snow knows as much of
the conduct of the street department as
any man in the city. . '. '
HIS BROTHER'S SKIN.
Frank Borchert Saved From Dis-
figurement by Grafting.
OAKLAND, July 14.â But for a piece of
human skin taken from his brother's arm
and neatly transplanted upon his visage,
Frank Borchert would have gone through
life with ugly powder marks disfiguring
his face. The skin-grafting operation
was successfully performed by Dr. XV. S.
Porter, acting surgeon at the Receiving
Hospital (luring Dr. Stratton's absence,
and the necessary cuticle was taken from
the left arm of Harry Borchert, the hos
pital steward. The powder stains on young
Borchert's forehead were the result of a
shot with a pistol at close range, some of
the grains penetrating to the bone, and
the only means of eliminating the disfig
uring marks was by cutting them away
and transplanting thereon new and
healthy skin. Once during the operation,
while Frank Borchert was under the in
fluence of the anesthetic, the steward be
came alarmed over his brother's pulse,
fearing that heart failure was inevitable.
However, the operation proved most sat
lsfactorv, and but for a big plaster adorn
ing Frank Borchert's forehead and face,
causing some inconvenience, and a slight
headache suffered by the steward, both
men are hearty and well.

BOLD ATTEMPT TO
STRANGLE A WOMAN
PATRICK FITZGIBBONS THROT
TLES MAY BURKE.
Held by the Police for Examination
by Captain Eowen and Chief
Lees Before Being Booked.
Patrick Fitzgibbons, who gives his oc
cupation as a clerk, attempted to stran
gle May Burke, a notorious woman, in a
room at 424 Dupont street about midnight
last night. The cries of the woman at
tracted the attention of Maggie O'Brien,
another Inmate of the house, who blew
a police whistle, summoning the police
and driving Fitzgibbons from the house.
The strangler was captured after a long
chase at the corner of Pine and San
some streets. He has been placed upon
the detinue book by Lieutenant Esola
pending an examination by Captain Bow
en and Chief Lees, who are acquainted
with the. details of the recent strangling
cases in this city and who may possibly
connect the perpetrator of last night's
attempt at crime with the party respon
sible for the death of several unfortunate
women. .
According to May Burke, who is 20
years old. Fitzgibbons accompanied her
to her room late in the evening. They
Quarreled over some money matters, and
inally the man grasped her by the
throat. There was a long struggle, dur
ing which she continually called for help
while he tightened h'.s grip upon her
neck. Finally a police whistle sounded,
and Fitzgibbons, realizing his predica
ment, released his grip and dashed out
of the room. Once out of the building,
the man rushed down Pine street. Offi
cers Chappelle, Flynn and Engle. who
had heard the alarm, started in chase,

dashed on. Officer de Gulre on Montgom

heading Fitzgibbons off. captured him
after a struggle at Sansome street.
At the police station the women told
their story. The accused is .queer acting

A. A. GRANT SUCCEEDS KING
ROAD FROM SAN PABLO TO
EMERY
*â 
Another Proof That the Southern
Pacific Will Have Strong
Opposition in the Bay
Traffic-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 14.
Another significant move has taken
place proving the absolute accuracy of the
story ln yesterday's Call that the Santa
Fe railroad Intended to absorb the Cali
fornia and Nevada road and the Oakland
system of street railroads. r '\ "."'â _
Yesterday C. K. King, the receiver and
manager of the little California railroad,
resigned and was succeeded by A. A.
Grant, a Contra Costa County, capitalist
and large holder of railroad bonds. Mr.
Grant is a heavy railroad contractor and
has done much railroad building for the
Santa Fe. Mr. Grant has owned some of
the California and Nevada bonds for a
long time, and something over a year ago
he made a trip East for the purpose of
buying enough bonds to give him a con
trolling interest in the road. He suc
ceeded to such an extent as to secure
his own appointment as the receiver.
Mr. Grant has carried out some of the
largest contracts for the Valley road, and
as the California railroad is absolutely
worthless except as an extension or ter
minus by which the Valley road can come
Into Oakland from Point Richmond, tnere
is no doubt whatever that Mr. Grant has
acquired the valuable franchise in the in
terests of the Santa Fe people.
In a conversation Mr. King, the retiring
receiver, said that the Santa Fe had not
yet purchased the little California rail
road, but that in all probability it will
soon become part of some system.
For a long time the road has been in
litigation, and it is now said that Mr.
Grant will so adjust matters that he will
become the absolute owner of the road for
the purpose of transferring it to the Santa
Fe, in whose interests he has been work
ing several years.

ANITA BYRNE WAS INSANE.
Coroner's Jury Says She Was Tempo-
rarily Deranged When She
Killed Herself.
The Coroner's jury yesterday returned
a verdict to the effect that Anita Byrne
committed suicide while temporarily in
sane. Several witnesses were examined
during the day and the drift of their tes
timony was to the effect that the mental
affliction of the deceased was caused
chiefly by domestic worries, jfnd not by
the rigors of the cast-iron rules under
which she worked as an operator in the
office of the telephone company.
Frank Seavers testified that the state
ment made by Mrs. F. L. Perkins, that he
and Miss Byrne had frequently reported
for duty at the Suiter street office of the
company in an intoxicated condition was
false, and that he had procured the dis
charge of Mrs. Perkins for violating the
rules of the office. Acting Superintendent
B. F. Lehigh and State Labor Commis
sioner Fitzgerald testified as to the treat
ment of its employes by the telephone
company, and Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Byrne,
the parents of the young woman, testified
that she had worried considerably over
the Illness of her sister.

SMITH NOT SHOT
BY COMPANIONS
Mine Guard May Have
Killed Him.
â â
. Special Dispatch to The Call.
WALLACE, Idaho, July 14.â The prose
cution to-day continued the tracing of the
movements of the rioters from the vari
ous camps of the Coeur d'Alenes to the
scene of the crimes of April 29. Conduc
tor Olmstead and Engineer Hutton told
how their train had been seized by a mob
at Burke and taken to Wallace, stopping
to take on board men at every mill and
camp on the road. At the Frisco mill
Hutton was compelled to back his train
to the powder house, where about one
hundred boxes of dynamite were placed
aboard. The man who seemed to be the
leader had first made his appearance at
Gem, masked and armed.
At Wallace it was necessary to change
from the Northern Pacific to the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company trade,
and the engineer refused to go farther
without an order from the railway offi
cials. While the leader and conductor
were searching for some one in authority
the mob became Impatient and ordered
Hutton to pull out. Those left behind
then took a yard engine and followed op
to Wardner. Both Hutton and Olmstead
have been In the bull pen, but secured
their release on bonds.
Dr. I. L. Magee gave testimony tending
to show that Smith could not have been
killed by his companions. Smith was a
member of the Burke Union and was one
of a party of skirmishers who went up the
hill back of and above the mill which was
blown up. The main body went along the
flat, and seeing the hill party opened fire,
mistaking them for enemies, itfore than
five hundred shots were fired- before the
mistake was discovered, and it was about
this time that Smith fell. The ball en
tered the back and came out under the
collarbone, passing through the body at
an angle of about twenty degrees. This
wound could have been made in but two
ways, according to the physician. Either
the man must have been standing on his
head or the shot came from above him.
Smith was farther up the hill than any
of his companions, and this testimony
might be considered as supporting the as
sertion often made but denied by the of
ficials of the Bunker Hill Company that
Smith was shot by one of the company's
guards who had retreated up the hill on
the approach of the mob.
A large number of witnesses testified to
the various crimes committed by the
rioters, but nothing tending to connect
the defendant with them was brought out.
The hew Board of County Commission
ers has appointed Angus Sutherland
Sheriff. Sutherland was the Republican
candidate for the shrievalty last election,
and was beaten by Young, who is now
confined under martial law. He has been
serving under Coroner France as chief
I deputy and summoned the jury now try
i ing Corcoran.

REDWOOD CITY, July 14.â The citizens
of San Mateo who own property there
and who will be seriously affected should
the claims of James J. Dow be sustained
by the courts have retained counsel to
represent them in the litigation that has
commenced. The proceedings commenced
by Dow upon the face are not such as to
attract any particular attention, but be
neath the surface they are sufficient to
cause considerable anxiety on the part of
numerous property owners in the very
center of the city of San Mateo. Dow
has filed a petition in the Superior Court
at this place praying for letters of ad
ministration upon the estate of his de
ceased father.
Another petition has been filed by Mag
gie J. Sullivan, the surviving wife of de
ceased, in which she asks the appointment
of Public Administrator James Crowe as
administrator. The two petitions will be
heard together on August 1, when the
court will determine to whom letters shall
be granted. William Dow died in San
Mateo on May 27, ISS2, leaving as his heirs
his widow, Maggie J. Dow, now Maggie
J. Sullivan. James J. Dow and a grand
son, Alfred W. Dow. For many years
prior to his death William Dow owned
real estate which is now some of the
most valuable residence property in
San Mateo. So far as can be learned, the
claims of the petitioner, James J. Dow,
to the estate which he seeks to recover
in the present proceedings are as follows:
William Dow owned the property in
1567, in which year he filed a homestead
upon it. His first wife died in 18&1 and he
remarried. The place was again home
steaded without having abandoned the
original. In 18S2 an action was com
menced against him to recover $1200, and
was reduced to a judgment. Under an
order of court the property was sold to
satisfy the judgment, and one J. F. Flem
ing became the purchaser. The property
was afterward transferred to M. Cun
ningham, who sold it to the Rev. A. L.
Brewer. Mr. Brewer placed the land on
the market and the present owners pur
chased from him. Dow's contention is
that the sale to Fleming was null and
void on account of the homestead stand
ing upon the property. The land has
passed into the hands of numerous per
sons, who have made valuable improve
ments upon it, the tract being valued at
the presnt at more than $100,000.
Those who are affected by the proceed
ings and the value placed upon their
holdings are as follows: Estate of John
Lee, $4000; P. P. Chamberlain, $10,000; F.
Demara, $15,000; C. Dlxson, $15,000; J. F.
Rogers, $20,000; R. Wisnon, $20,000; Joseph
Paradi, $10,000; Mrs. S. C. Maybury, $3000;
XV. C. Caldwell, $3000; R. Lutton. $3500;
William Caldwell. $2500; M. Doherty, $2000:
Mrs. H. Jansen, $2000; John Sullivan, $3500.
Curious Custom.
In China it is the custom for guests at din-
ners to run around between the courses. This
la supposed to keep the diner's digestion In
good condition, but the nervous, hustling
American needs something else, and there ls
nothing better than Hostetter's Stomach Bit-
ters. If a man or woman is suffering with
constipation, Indigestion or any stomach
trouble, it's their fault If they don't get well.
Hostetter's Stomach Bitters will cure them.
See that a private Revenue Stamp covers the
neck of the bottle.

DR. ABORN
554 SUTTER STREET, above Powell.
Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat and
Lung Specialist.
One of the first physicians on the American continent, over thirty
years ago. to make diseases of the above-named organs a specialty, as
well as all affections of the digestive organs and nervous and chronic
dlS antiseptic germicial Inhalation and building up and revitalizing
treatment are the most rational and successful methods known to
modern science. "While on the Pacific Coast, from '69 to ,6, his suc-
cess was phenomenal, and many whom he cured at that time are still
living and remain permanently well, after a lapse of -5 to 30 years.
His patients almost invariably EXPERIENCE IMMEDIATE RE-
LIEF and gain in weight 10 to 30 pounds in 30 to 60 days.
A thorough course of treatment is prepared and furnished in most
cases upon the first consultation, which can be used at the patient s
home. HOME TREATMENT through correspondence for those who re-
side in remote parts of the State and adjoining States and Territories

PR. ABORN'S "Essay on the Curability of Consumption, with evi-
dences of some extraordinary cures, can be had upon application.
HIGH INDORSEMENTS.
Will* located in Washington. D. C. prior to his visit to San Francisco Cal.,
thirty years ago. Dr. Aborn treated and cured the roost noted men of the nation.
THROAT AND LUNGS.
The New Theory top Diseases of the Air Passages. A Word
From an Old School Physician as to Its Merits.
There are many systems of medicine by â which we attempt to heal the human
body and make It free of disease, ranting from the science of Allopathy down to that
of Hydropathy. How far they have succeeded time has abundantly shown by tne
number of their failures, a_ well as by the number and nature of their cures.
In the cure of pulmonary disease. Dr. Aborn has stepped out of the old beaten
track and adopted a system so simple, direct and natural as to recommend itself to
all who are suffering from catarrh and disease of the lungs, of a character defying
cure by any of the old methods of treatment.
Although from childhood I have been raised, and also went through a regular
course and graduated as an Allopathist. yet a strict love of what is right and best,
as well as PERSONAL BENEFIT RECEIVED BY THE NEW SYSTEM as practiced
by Dr. Ahorn. teaches me to bear some testimony to Its merits for the benefit of suffer-
ing humanity. A. FALCONER, M. D.. Lawrenceville, Pa-
February 5, 1567.
From Hon. John Covode, M. C, Pennsylvania.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 12, 1868.
For more than a year I suffered Inconvenience from deafness and a constant
sounding in mv ear. On the 21st of May I applied for relief to Dr. Aborn. He relieved
me at once, and from that day to this I have had no difficulty of any kind with my
hearing. Truly JOHN COVODE, M. C, Pa.

The noted celebrity which you have already achieved in your specialties must be
as peculiarly gratifying to yourself as it is to your friends.
With the sincere desire that you may continue in the future to relieve Buffering

To Whom It May Concernâ
1 can freely say of Dr. Aborn, to whom this letter is given, thai I have for him
high esteem as a gentleman and as a physician. I have been for some time ac-
quainted with him quite intimately, and have ever found him thoroughly a gentleman,
straightforward in business, and prompt in action as in promise. As a physician he
has in this city, where he sojourned during the summer, given proof of great, If not
remarkable, skill. I am acquainted with many of the persons in this State whom he
has cured of diseases that were considered Incurable, and have been at several times
__ witness to his experts-ess in difficult cases. J. S. CLARKSON, Editor Register.
His Former Visit to the Pacific Coast.
Dr. Aborn arrived in San Francisco on the 21st day of October, 3 .69. from Wash-

who have worthily filled the highest offices in the gilt of the people. Among these
was one of the Hon. James A. Johnson, then a member of Congress from California,
to his Excellency. Frank McCoppin, then Mayor of San Francisco, which ls hereto

DEAR SIR: â Tills will introduce Dr. Aborn, for whom I ask the consideration to
which he, as a man of science and skill in his profession, is entitled. I have personal
knowledge of some Wonderful cures wrought by hit. treatment. 1 can most cheerfully
recommend him to you and all my California friends. Respectfully and truly,

EVIDENCES OF DR. ABORN~S SUCCESS IN SAN FRANCISCO.
From Hon. S. 0. Houghton, California.
SAN JOSE, November 22. 1869.
I have been afflicted with severe nasal catarrh for two years, which a few months
since extended to my throat, producing a distressing cough and seriously impairing my
health generally. I have been under the treatment of Dr. Aborn for about three
weeks, and have been already greatly relieved; my cough has almost disappeared, and
my health greatly improved. By one application Dr. Aborn relieved me of a severe
neuralgic pain, and with four applications it was entirely cured.

SAN FRANCISCO. February 19, 1870.
Were it not for the good which I hope it may have done to suffering humanity by
Informing them where they could find relief, I should regret having given Dr. Aborn
my little testimonial of the 10th January, for the demands made upon my time in
answering inquiries in regard to him have been more numerous than profitable to me;
and still they come.
To save the necessity for further personal application, let me say to those who
care for my opinion that time has only strengthened my flrst favorable opinion of Dr.
Aborn, and my confidence in
THE PERMANENCE OF THE CURE . /-
Effected by him. All my difficulty arose from catarrh, which had become of a serious
character, affecting the hearing and the throat, giving me at times acute pains and at
others rumbling sounds In the ears, frequent headaches, and so seriously affecting the
bronchial tubes as to sometimes disable me from public speaking. It is all gone, and
the change was produced, not by the absurd practice of putting medicines into the
stomach, which was not affected, but by the skillful application of medicinal remedies
directly to the parts which were diseased. I have found the Doctor a gentleman in his
intercourse and business, and the judgment that I have formed of him professionally
ls, that he is a regular physician, thoroughly acquainted with the anatomy of the hu-
man body, and possessing a remarkable degree of skill in the treatment of those
diseases which he makes his specialty. CHARLES N. FOX.

SAN FRANCISCO, April (>, 1870.
Having suffered nine or ten years with a throat and bronchial affection, I applied
to Dr. Aborn, at San Francisco, who has treated me for about two months. I feel it
my duty to state, for the benefit of those afflicted ln like manner, that I found im-
mediate and, I think, permanent relief from his treatment, and that I consider his
treatment scientific, and that the Doctor is master of his profession.

DR. ABORNâ Dear Sir: I have thought that possibly you might be pleased to
know the condition of the little school girl, Mary Morris, whom you treated gome
months ago at my request, and who, you will remember, was nearly deaf and seri-
ously afflicted with some bronchial trouble when she went to you. She is now en-
tirely cured both of deafness and bronchial affection, and declares that she was
substantially cured on her first visit to you. She and her parents are very grateful
to you, and think it is wholly due to your skill that her hearing and health are re-
stored. Yours truly, R. P. CLEMENT,

DES MOINES, la.. May 29, 1899.
TO WHOM IT MAT CONCERN:
The undersigned, a resident of the city of Dcs Moines for the past thirty-seven
years, desires to bear testimony to the skill of Dr. Aborn in the treatment of pul-
monary and kindred complaints. About the year 1876 I was very seriously afflicted
with bronchial and lung troubles; in fact, had two or three quite severe hemorrhages,
and my left lung was practically -useless. Dr. Aborn treated me constitutionally and
by local Inhalation applications, and within two months' time I was practically
cured. I continued the treatment for some time longer and have never suffered a day
since from any trouble of the kind. And my lungs and bronchia! tubes have been
sound, I believe, as any one's could be, and are at the present time, after a lapse
of twenty-three years. I have known the doctor and of his successful practice for the
past thirty years.
During the doctor's practice at that time I personally knew of a number of people
whom he treated with pronounced success. From my own personal experience and
observation cf his treatment of others I believe the doctor to be capable of doing a
great good to persons afflicted with such troubles. Very respectfully,
THOS. HATTON.

TO WHOM IT MAT CONCERNâ
I hereby wish to bear testimony to the skill of Dr. Aborn in his specialties.
About thirty years ago the doctor treated my daughter for deafness and disease
of the ear and gave her Instant relief, and soon effected a permanent cure. She
remains well to-day after thirty years, the hearing being restored and the diseased
ear cured. At the same time I knew of other cases that he treated equally as suc-
cessful as that of my daughter. Very respectfully, B. F. ALLEN.
"While There Is Life There Is Hope."
Dr. Aborn is prepared to give the afflicted the most approved modern scientific
treatment for the various diseases embraced ln his specialties. With his improved
facilities and large experience ln the treatment of throat and lung- diseases, nasal
catarrh, diseases of the eye and ear, affections of the digestive organs, nervous sys-
tem, etc. Dr. Aborn is prepared to treat with almost unfailing success all such
cases as may come under his care. None should despair, no matter how severe or
aggravated their cases may be.
Dr. Aborn has given abundant and substantial evidences of his wonderful suc-
cess in restoring his patients to perfect health after all the ordinary methods have
failed. The parties from whom Dr. Aborn has received the most flattering testi-
monials are well known and Influential citizens, who have given their cards to the
public, not only because of their gratitude to Dr. Aborn, but with the sincere desire
to benefit their fellow sufferers, by assuring them that health and happiness, through
exemption from suffering, are also within their reach, by an Intelligent recognition of
the great superiority of Dr. Aborn's great modern method of treatment.

Tribute to the Sister Republics, and
All Join in the "Marseillaise"
and "Star-Spangled
Banner."
Yesterday was the one hundred and
tenth anniversary of the Fall of the
Bastlle. All loyal sons of France crowded
out at the Chutes and with a fervid
patriotism and much enthusiasm cele
brated their day of liberty. The trl-color
and the stars and stripes mingled their
folds and able orators paid tribute to
the two great republics. i 'â â¢ .â ':"â â 
Throughout the exercises arranged in
honor of the day the strong bond of sym
pathy the French citizen feels for his
adopted country -was made manifest. Ref
erences to our recent great victories were
hailed with deafening cheers, and the way
the vast foreign audience arose and as
one man took up the chorus of the "Star-
Spangled Banner" showed that America
has no more sincere admirers than the
patriotic sons of France, no truer patriots
and citizens than the sons of Frenchmen.
On the stage representatives of the two
great republics occupied the seats of
honor. General Shafter and his staff and
the Governor of Oregon and his staff sat
beside the French Consul, President Le
gallet, and the officers of the day.
Governor Geer and his staff remained
interested spectators until the time de
manded that the Governor repair to the
review of his valiant boys. As they left
the hall, stepping briskly to the inspiring
"Yankee Doodle," the Frenchmen arose
and cheered and cheered and cheered
again until the rafters re-echoed their
glad shoutings.
The programme prepared ln honor of- the
celebration was a happy mingling of
"SALUT A LA FRANCE!- VIVE LA REPUBLIQUE!"
j music and oratory. The first speaker of
the day was M. Arthur Legallet, presi
dent of the day.
Mr. Legallet began his patriotic effort
! by welcoming those who had assembled
j to do honor to the day all true French
men love. In his welcome he did not for
get the distinguished Americans present
and paid through them tribute to their
I country and the boys we proudly wel-
I corned heme yesterday. Mr. Legallet said
in part:
In making to-day the apotheosis of lib
erty in the land of this great American
people who give us such a generous and
cordial hospitality, let us 'not forget that
they preceded us in the era of emancipation,
and that the dates of the 4th of July. 1776.
and the 14th of July 1789, shine together
with the same brilliancy in the glorious an
nals of free nations.

This manifestation, dear fellow-country
men, will be a worthy apotheosis of the
nineteenth century, which has brought
forth so many marvels; worthy also of the
twentieth century which is about to open
before us, in the mysterious depths in which
thinkers dare to foresee a new dawn m
humanity; worthy, finally, of France, which
has delevoped it, and which brings forth
thus gloriously a harvest from the fields
of peace after "having brought forth those of
liberty. -'.::.
Franklin K. Lane, who was the English
speaker of the day, was listened to with
profound attention and greeted with much
applause. Mr. Lane spoke as follows:
The honest men who wrote history tell us
that the Anglo-Saxon people were rather a
sodden and dreary lot before the invasion of
the French under William the Conqueror.
The Influx of these gallant and gay knights
of France softened and made less somber
the character of the English people. So,
I have no doubt, will those who come to
write the history of this State and of this
city dwell with strong emphasis upon the
great contribution made to the character
of our Western civilization by the French
men and women who made their homes
here.
The French domain is broader than
France, broader than any territorial lines.
Wherever men have minds to appreciate
the nobler products of the Imagination,
wherever there is that blending of manner
and mind which we call culture the spirit
of France ls sovereign.
France might be wiped from the map of
Europe and her people scattered to the ends
of the earth, yet France would not die.
She cannot die. She will live forever in
the novels of Hugo, Balzac and Dumas, ln
the songs of Beranger and De Musset, In
the canvases of Millet and Corot, in the â 
plays of Mollere, Racine and Rostand, ln
the eloquence of Bossuet. Fenelon, Gam
betta, ln the deeds of Bayard, Henry of
Navarre and the first Napoleon. That
France is mine as well as yours.
An artistic people are always dramatic.
This explains much to those of us who are
not French. It explains the difference be
tween your Declaration of Independence
upon July 14, 1759, an _ our Declaration of .
Independence upon July 4, 1776. The Amer
lean delegates . sat in solemn, serious and
formal session and wrote their names to a
piece of paper In which they pledged to the
cause or liberty their lives, their fortunes
and their sacred honors. The French peo
ple, no less In earnest, broke down the gates
of the Bastlle, set free lie prisoners and
razed it to the ground.
Your way was not our way. but your
purpose was our purpose.
There have been many causes given by
the writers for the French revolution. But
there Is a simple reason for the fall of the
Bastile â the people had learned through
long centuries to know their rights; the â 
natural love of freedom had at last grown
too strong for curbing conditions; the
French people had come to see that there
was something superior in value to state,
to institutions, to laws themselves; they
had discovered man, not one man, the
King, not a few men, the nobles, but all
men, their brothers.
It was this discovery that brought the
Bastlle to the ground: It- was this spirit,
though perhaps not then so well defined,
that made France the friend of America in
our Revolutionary war. We had written
our Declaration of Independence: France
was waiting but a few days till she should
write hers. I take ingratitude to be the
meanest of vices, whether In man or nation.
And I believe that the generous people of
the United States will regard forever with
the slncerest affection that nation which
gave us her hand across the sea and so
helped us to stand upon our feet and to
grow into the strong and puissant nation we
are to-day. '.Â»â . â .'â¢â â -'' --'â _.-
America takes a deep interest in the
progress of events of France, not alone be
cause of what we have done together, but
because of what we hope to do tojrether.
After Mme. Lucie Fichter had sung with
dramatic effect "Salut a Ia France," and a
telegram of congratulation had been read
from Mayor Phelan. M. de Trobriand, the
French Consul General, was introduced.
The Consul prefaced his address with a
gracious tribute to the people who had
recently welcomed him so warmly in their
midst.. He spoke In terms of enthusiasm
about the great good accomplished by the
Frenchwomen = who so nobly give their
time and attention to charity.
"This fete," he said, "takes us momen
tarily back to our own country. We can
make here a small France without dis
tinctions of political opinion, religious
ideas or social rank.
"The history of France shows that she
is greater because of the terrible ordeals
to which she has had to submit, and that
she remains at the head of civilization."
M. de Trobriand commented enthusias
tically on the Exposition of 1900 and hoped
that crowds from all parts of the world
would be welcomed there. He concluded:
"Let us remain always faithful to the
country which has so liberally given it
self to the cause of liberty. Let us have
but one flag, with the three national col
ors and our one sole motto: 'All for our
country!'
"Long live France! Long live the re
public! Long live her President!"

His discourse was a most able one, and
the sentiments of true patriotism it ex
pressed aroused wild enthusiasm. ______
First of all M. Goustiaux touched upon
the history of the day, and then the peo
ple who made the day. After a brief out
striking historical review the orator sain
"This rapid historical review brings us
to the logical conclusion that It is our
duty to take an example from these ex
traordinary men who inspire us to sublime
virtues, disinterestedness and indifference
to death, love of liberty and country.
"With such liberty as we ha\e there is
no need of revolution. It is for the na
tion itself, which is altogether for the
power of universal suffrage, to break the
pride and ambition of those who are
against justice and truth, in throwing
on them its scorn and repudiating them.
"France has accomplished great things
and is now in the forefront of thought, the
arts, liberty and social progress. We are
proud of her, and we can be proud or
those who have occupied the Presidency
of the republic. France, for her past as
for her present, merits if not the friend
ship at least the respect of other peo
ples. One cannot insult her; her honor is
too high. Whoever injures her is im
pious.
"Vive la France!"

seillaise" was sung, the audience stand
ing joining in the chorus. _ ,-â _ â >'â â â '..

DISPLAY OF FIREWORKS.
Thousands Cheer the Olympia
as She Opened Her Guns on
the Shore Battery.
Long before the display of fireworks
commenced last night the grounds at the
Chutes were packed with people, and
around the lake, where the display was
made, there was a sea of faces, the gen
tler sex predominating.
It was about 9:30 o'clock when the first
bombs and mortars were fired off, and
they were lost to sight in the fog, much
to the disappointment of the spectators.
The set pieces were "France and the na
tional coat of arms," "A French soldier,"
"The battleship Olympia" and a shore
battery, concluding with a bouquet of
colors that charmed the beholders. When
the Olympia appeared, with the Stars and
Stripes at her stern, there were cheers
from thousands of throats, and as the
shore battery commenced firing upon her
and she replied with her guns the cheers
were renewed again and again. A clown
in variegated colors on a horizontal bar
caused considerable amusement by his
vain attempts to turn a somersault. The
display. was one of the best seen at the
Chutes, and it was unfortunate that the
fog interfered with a proper showing of
the bombs and mortars. It took over half
an hour, and after it was concluded there
was a rush for the dance hall, where the
delight of the waltz and deux-temps held
the crowd till the early morning.

WINEMAKERS`
PROSPECTS ARE
ENCOURAGING
Plan of H. J. Crocker
Progresses.
The predictions made in The Call about
three weeks ago that the majority of pro
ducers of dry wines would not sign con
tracts to deliver their products to the
California Winemakers' Corporation dur
ing the next five years was correct. It is
now conceded that the corporation will
not be able to secure the necessary 55 per
cent of the growers and the hope of those
who best understand the needs of the In
dustry is that the producers will rally to
the support of Henry J. Crocker and ac
cept his offer of $14 per ton for grapes
for the next seven years. s '
lt is understood that Mr. Crocker is
backed by the solid men in the business,
who recognize the necessity of keeping
the market steady and holding the price
of grapes (which represents the value of
wine) up to its proper figure. Unless
some such plan can be adopted and put in
successful operation there is no doubt
that the prices of wines will gradually
drop to the ruinous figures of 1596 and the
early nineties, when good, sound wine
could be bought for 4 and 5 cents per
gallon. In fact, during the battle between
the corporation and the merchants sound
wine was sold for New Orleans delivery
for 2 cents.
It is to avoid the repetition of such a
crisis that the present strenuous efforts
are being made to hold the winemakers
and grape growers together. so that they
cannot be driven Into a price-cutting situ
ation. The merchants and the best pro
ducers are agreed that without proper
co-operation prices are certain to take a
slump. The reception of Mr. Crocker's
proposition was so cool at first that the
well wishers of the scheme were rather
disheartened, but the situation is rapidly
improving and the outlook is decidedly
encouraging. Wine men who rejected the
offer on its original presentation have
signed and are now urging their neighbors
to do likewise.
"The offer of Mr. Crocker has left the
reorganization plan of the Winemakers'
Corporation in the background, and our
hopes are now confined to his plan to
.reserve the industry from the evil of
ow prices that is sure to come if both
the schemes fail." So said Secretary
Hotchkiss. of the big wine corporation yes
terday.
"The proposition," continued he, "has
aroused a great deal of interest, and the
wine men are rapidly swinging into line.
Mr. Crocker has been notified by the pro
ducers of Northern Sonoma to meet them
in a meeting on Saturday at Cloverdale,
and the Santa Clara County people will
convene for the purpose of signing the
agreement on Tuesday next. The pros
pects are cheering at the present time,
and I feel almost convinced that the suf
ficient number of producers will see .the
necessities of the situation and enter into
the contract with the gentleman. If they
do the stability of the industry for the
next five or six years will be assured.
At the same time there is no doubt that
there will be a revival of replanting, but
these vineyards would not come into bear- i
ing for five or six years, and the Increase j
in the demand for our wines by that time |
would without doubt handily take care |
of the added product. If the wine men
know when they are well off they will j
stand together at this critical time."
THE KOPP MURDER.
Judge Conlan Hears the Arguments
of- Counsel and Will Give His
Decision Monday.
The arguments of counsel in the case of
Mrs. Louisa Kopp, charged with the mur
der of her husband, were heard by Judge
Conlan yesterday morning. During the
argument of her attorney, ex-Judge Fer
ral, Mrs. Kopp seemed deeply affected,
and kept her handkerchief to her eyes
most of the time. Her daughter sat be
side her. Prosecuting Attorney Low in a
brief address referred to the evidence and
said that as. a committing magistrate the
Judge had < only r one course to pursueâ to
hold the defendant.
Ex-Judge Ferral made â¢an impassioned
address on behalf of the defendant, refer
( Hales.
ring to her husband's brutality and his
conduct with Mrs. Monti as justification
for her act. He pointed to the defend
ant's physical condition, and said that if
she were kept in close confinement for the
next three months there would be no trial,
but a funeral instead. He urged the Judge
to dismiss the case, as he felt satisfied
that no jury would convict her.
Prosecuting Attorney Low, after com
plimenting the attorney for the defend
ant on his address, remarked that the
Judge was not a jury. "I want to know."
he said, "if it Is the law of this State that
when a wife gets jealous of her husband
she can take a revolver and shoot him."
He would not assume the responslbiiity
of asking that the case be dismissed. The
Judge said he would render his decision
Monday morning.
CHARGED WITH MURDER.
Coroner's Jury Returned a Verdict in
the Case of the Death of Mrs.
Kennedy.
Coroner Hill held an inquest yesterday
morning into the death of Mrs. M. A
Kennedy, who was struck with a lighted
coal oil lamp on July 4 by Cornelius Man

Manning, mother of the prisoner, was
unable to be present. Dr. Pescia certify

prostration. Paul Kennedy, husband of
the dead woman, was the principal wit

thing new. The Jury returned a verdict
that Mrs. M. A. Kennedy "came to her
death on the 10th day of July, 1899, from

caused by a lighted oil lamp being thrown
from the hands of Cornelius Manning,
and we charge the said Cornelius Manning
with murder."

The habeas corpus case instituted by

ill repute, to regain possession of Kirn
Oy, a Chinese girl rescued by the Eu
reka Society at 14 Spofford alley, on the
12th inst., came up before Judge Lawlor
at 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
The case turned on the age of the girl,
and although she was loudly coached by
Chinese present to say she was 19 years
old, she broke down under cross-exami
nation. The court refused the writ and
continued the case to Tuesday afternoon
at 1:30 o'clock. _,
The agents of the society, of which L

from court. She was finally, by the aid
of five policemen, hurried into a hack and
driven to the Methodist Mission at 916
