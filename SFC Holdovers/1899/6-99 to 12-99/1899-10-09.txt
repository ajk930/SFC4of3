SHARP BATTLES WITH
FILIPINO INSURGENTS
Stubborn Resistance to the Advance
of General Schwan's Column.
Americans Sustain Con=
siderable Losses.
MANILA, Oct. B. Two columns of the American forces south of this city
moved to-day. One, under command of General Schwan. left Binacayan for
San Nicolas. This force consists of the Thirteenth Infantry, three com
panies of the Fourteenth and two gun.* of Reilly's Battery of the Fifth Artil
lery- The other column, which Is made up of a battalion of the Fourth In
fantry, left Imus to sweep along the Zapote River. Tills movement In two
directions will do much to clean out the Insurgent strongholds in the
south. The rebel leaders in that section are making strenuous efforts to
keep the American troops from moving northward.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. S.â lt is learned to-night that the offensive move
ments inaugurated in Luzon to-day are for the purpose of preventing the In
surgents from Intrenching themselves so as to embarrass the operations of the
American troops when operations of the dry season begin. Colonel Thomas
Ward, Acting Adjutant General, received a dispatch from General Otis an
nouncing the movement and stating that the columns would operate as de
scribed. There are several strong positions held and fortified by the insur
gent*, and General Schwan will capture them under the instructions given
him. It Is not Intended to occupy the country traversed and when the troops
have driven the Insurgents away from their positions and destroyed the
fortifications they will return to their present station.
NOVELETA, Island of Luzon, Oct. B.â
General Schwan's column, consist
ing of the Thirteenth Infantry, a
battalion of the Fourteenth, two
troops of cavalry, Captain Reilly's bat
' tery of the Fifth Artillery and Lowe's
scouts, advanced from Bacoor this morn
' ing and occupied Cavlte Viejo and Nove
let. ;. The American loss, was three, officers
and nine privates wounded, one of the
officers being mortally hurt. The loss of
â¢ the enemy is unknown, but the bodies of
three Filipinos were seen.
There ere two sharp fights near Nove
lets. Lowe's scouts first encountered the
enemy near Cavite Vlejo and soon put
them to flight, continuing their advance.
Captain Saffoid's battalion of the Thir
teen ;h Regiment, with 'â¢â¢ companies of
the Fourteenth and a number of Tagalo
scouts. Captain McGrath commanding
the troops of the Fourth Cavalry, and
Captain Leilly's battery came upon the
i nemy in a strongly Intrenched position
on the road between Cavite Viejo and
Novelet?. A tight lasting half an hour
followed, resulting in the enemy being
driven back. The American forces sus
tained considerable losses in this engage
ment, being shot from the trenches and
shacks along the ror.d.
The column then pressed on to Nove
leta, which they found deserted, and will
remain there to-night.
The marines and naval forces co-opcr
ntcd with the troops. The gunboats
Wheeling. Petrel and Called lay off the
Â«no;o near. JOm ulcta and it: row phellgi into
the town and Santa Cruz for an hour,
pi'cpailns the way for the marines to
lord. Two battalions, consisting' of 430
mattnea; under Colonel Elliott^ advanced
along th<-- peninsUli' from Cavite to' Nove
l'-ta. Ihe only way was Â»by a n?.rrov.
rend through swamps.
A mile beyond the marines' outpost the
column was suddenly received with a vol
ley from trenches across the road. A
flank movement was executed and the in
surgents were driven from the trenches,
the m&rines wading through rice fields in
turning the flank of the enemy, who re
treated to strong sand forts across the
(reek dividing the peninsula, destroying
the bridge across the stream.
The marines waded through more rice
fields, forded the river In water to their
shoulders and carried the forts, meeting
with feeble resistance, the first encounter
having disheartened the enemy. Squads
were sent to Ncveleta and burned the
town and the huts all along the roads
from which the enemy commenced firing.
There a junction was formed with the
scouts, who had â¢< en sweeping the
swamps and thickets. Thence the marines
returned to Cavite. thoroughly exhausted.
Lieutenant Wynne, with a three-pound
er, did good execution during the ad
vance. General Lawton was not in per
sonal command of to-day's movements.
Captain Cowl**' battalion of the Fourth
Infantry while reconnoitering to-day
found a body of several hundred insur
gents near San Nicolas. After a brisk
fight lasting three-quarters of an hour the
enemy was driven off. In this engagement
the American casualties were four men
slightly wounded. Six of the enemy were
killed, but the number of wounded is not
known.
The bad condition of the roads made
the progress of the artillery Blow.
VESSELS FOR THE
BLOCKADE OF LUZON
WASHINGTON, Oct. Under orders
Issued by the Navy Department the cruis
er Brooklyn will sail from Hampton
Roads on Tuesday for Manila via Suez
Canal. The Nashville will leave San Juan
this week for the same destination by the
same route. The New Orlans will require
six days in which to make slight altera
tion?, and she will then proceed to join
Rear Admiral Watson. Reports received
from the auxiliary cruiser Badger show
that she is In need of considerable repairs,
and it may be considered advisable to
transfer her officers and crew to the
Ranger, just completed, and dispatch that
vessel to join the Asiatic squadron. Orders
have been telegraphed to the Boston Navy
Yard to expedite work on the gunboat
Bancroft, and she will be placed in com
mission without loss of time and sent- to
the far east. The gunboat Annapolis is
now at the Norfolk navy yard, and her
repairs will be pushed. The protected
cruiser Albany will be completed by Jan
uary 1, and orders will shortly be issued
for the preparation of her detail of officers
and crew, and they will be sent to Eng
land to take charge of the vessel, pro
ceeding at once to Manila. The gunboat
Machlas- has been ordered to Boston to
undergo repairs, and the Marietta may
be sent to Manila without making the
survey of the mouth of the Orinoco orig
inally ordered.
It is confidently expected that such a
strict blockade of Luzon will be maintained
by Rear Admiral Watson when all the
vessels of his command have reached
their destination that the Filipinos will
not be able to renew their supplies of
munitions of war and food. The blockade
which has been Instituted since the rebell
ion began has been moderately successful.
The last mall reports from Manila an
nounce the capture of three sailing ves
sels varying from twenty-four to seventy
three tons register, designated as the
Neustra Senora de Remedio, Carman
Venus and Campana. The seizures were
made by the Princeton off the coast of
Batagas. Luzon, and the owners and offi
cers of the ships were charged with illegal
practices In effecting clearances, In fal
sifying log books and engaging in illicit
trade at island ports in possession of the
Insurgents. The last advices received are
The San Francisco Call.

SCORES THE PRESIDENT
FOR PHILIPPINE POLICY
NEW YORK, Oct. B.â Robert Treat
Payne Jr., Democratic candidate for Gov
ernor, in an Interview said:
"President M. Kit, ley has shown his
hand. Neither Christianity nor morality
nor faithful adherence to tne principles
of our constitution, which he has taken
the oath to observe, seem to be dominant
' motives in extending our sovereignty
i over the Philippine islands. In one part
I of the archipelago a treaty has been made
with the Sultan of the Moros. where po
lygamy flourishes and slavery prevails,
j and it Is agreed to protect their Institu
tions and bar out Christian missionaries
from among his Mohammedan subjects.
The boy at the Latin school would call this
a declaration contrary to or without re
â  gard to fact. The thirteenth amendment
. to the constitution aeclares that slavery
shall not exist in the United States or any
place subject to their jurisdiction. Yet
here President McKinley ha 3 raised the
star spangled banner as an emblem to the
Mohammedan for protection to the harem
and the slave pen."

BRITISH CAMP AT MAFEKING
AROUSED AND GUNS UNLIMBERED
Boers Move to the Border in Large Force and Great
Britain Is Rushing Preparations for
the Coming Hostilities. :
PRESIDENT KRUGER IN THE PULPIT AT PRETORIA.
While questions of state occupy th attention of Oom Paul during the week, on Sundays he preaches to his follow
ers in the Reformed Dutch Church at the capital of the republic. This picture is reproduced from a sketch in Black
and White.'
LONDON, Oct. The important i
news from South Africa comes .
from Mafeking, where twice on
Saturday the British camp was
aroused, the men stood to their
arms, guns were limbered and patrols j
were dispatched In the direction of the I
border. No hostilities have occurred as i
yet, but the enemy has moved practically
to the border, eight miles from Mafeking,
in force estimated at least 6000, comprising
five commandos. The garrisoning and
fortifying of the town are practically
completed. The streets are barricaded
and a perfect system of mines has been
laid. Two armored trains have arrived at
Mafeking, consisting of three bullet
proof cars, the first of which carries a
searchlight, while the rest of the cars
are loopholed. Each train Is complete in i
itself and carries its own provisions. Ex
periments with lyddite in the mines prove I
that it is an extremely powerful explo- .
sive.
Colonel Robert Stephenson Smith Ba- j
den-Powell, commanding the Fifth Dra- j
goon Guards, has issued a. notice that the ;
Boers who are massed on the Natal and
Bechuanaland frontiers have orders not
to fire until the British begin, and that
the town is well prepared for eventuali
ties, but as the Boers may shell the place
every endeavor should be made to safe
guard the women and children.
An armored train was inspected at Kirn
berly Saturday. A signal station has been
erected with a conning tower at the top
130 feet above the tracks. Communication
by telephone is had with a central office
and signals are given to the troops by
flag. By this means maneuvers were suc
cessfully, conducted Saturday. The troops
number 3000, including the bicycle corps.
A train was also successfully tested at
Mafeking. It patrolled to the north and
practiced firing at targets.
A dispatch from Kirnberly to the Cape j
Argus says that 3000 Boers are encamped j
midway between Boshof and Kirnberly. |
They are well armed and great religious
fervor is shown in the camp. The Boers,
however, are chaffing under the delay.
They patrol the border nightly and have
been ordered not to permit a British uni
form to approach the frontier.
A special order gas gazetted on Satur
day announcing what British residents
would be allowed to remain in the Trans
vaal and under what conditions.
Whatever may be the result of
Great Britain's controversy with the
South African republic. every de
partment of the Government to-day Is j
as busy as though actual hostilities had J
begun. The electric flash that announced i
the mobilization of the army reserves and j
the summoning of Parliament set every
wheel of the Government machinery in
motion. An hour after the gazette ap- I
peared executive orders were being dis
patched, from the War Office to every j
section of the kingdom, and the 10,000 bul- j
letins which appeared posted throughout |
the country to-day arc said to have been j
identical with the proclamation prepared
for use had the Fashoda incident re- 1
quired such a step.
At the same time Lord Salisbury and
Mr. Balfour were issuing thÂ© necessary
orders for the reassembling of Parlia- '
ment and the admiralty was concentrating !
its transports, twenty-four of which are I
now at Liverpool alone. So complete
were the preparations that 25,000 reserves I
have already individually received coupon
tickets, which contain instructions where
each man shall report for railway trans
portation to the place designated and a i
money order for three shillings for pro
visions en route.
At Woolwich to-day it was asserted that
95 per cent of the reserves would be fully
equipped within six days.' In the mean- j
time the members of the two. houses of ]
Parliament' are arranging to' return to
London, and a force of men is busily en- i
gaged in completing the improvements at j
Westminster.
HOSTILITIES ARE
EXPECTED THIS WEEK
LONDON, Oct. 9.â The Cape Town cor- |
respondent of the Dally Mall declares !
that the story of a Boer ultimatum de- !
manding the withdrawal of the British i
troops from the frontiers has been -pre- j
sented is without foundation, but he says :
the republics have within the past week
demanded a declaration of the British In
tentions In threatening terms. Hostilities ;
In the outlying districts, the correspond- !
ent says, are expected this week. .
Mr. Hofmeycr, the Afrikander leader in
Cape Colony, said on Friday, according'
to a correspondent of the Daily Mail, that
but for him the Boers would have been j
fighting long ago. The correspondent ]
further says: .'-The. financial position of i
the Free State. is becoming acute, and |
suspension of specie payments is ex- i
pected soon. The Free State's National
bank credit In Cape Town has been stop- |
ped. The Orange Raad, in Becret ses- I
sion,' passed a law empowering the Presi
dent to use the revenues of the State and I
to borrow money to conduct the war. |
"The Cape bank refused to honor paper i
from both republics and the Transvaal |
coinage has seriously depreciated, silver i
not being negotiable even In the Trans
vaal itself. The Pretoria mint Is. work
ing day and night minting the gold stolen
from the mall train, but Kruger gold has
been tested since the mint was opened,
and therefore the, coinage . practically
consists of expensive tokens."

STEYN HOPES FOR A
PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT
BLOEMFONTEIN, O. F. S., Oct. B.â
The correspondence between President
Steyn and, Sir Alfred Milner, British High
Commissioner in South Africa and Gover
nor of Cape Colony, has been published.
In a communication dated September 26
President Steyn pointed out that tho tone
of the British dispatches was altered and
that the Imperial Government' had de
parted from the original basis of. negotia
tions with the Transvaal. On 'his advice
the Transvaal had agreed to the holding
of an inquiry, and the Free State was
greatly disappointed that Its" efforts In
favor of a peaceful solution had not
availed. "-â  ''â â â â 
The Free State, Mr. Steyn said, was
still prepared to tender its services to pro
cure a solution of the difficulties on fair
and reasonable lines. It felt hampered,
however, by want of knowledge of the
definite object and the extent of the de
sires or demands of the Imperial Govern
ment, â¢ compliance with which the Gov
ernment considers itself entitled to Insist
upon, and the grounds upon j which such
insistence were based; and further by the
fact that notwithstanding repeated assur
ances that the Imperial Government does
not wish to interfere with the internal
affairs of the Transvaal or to disturb its
independence it has pursued a policy
justifying contrary conclusions.
The Free State, says Mr. Steyn, cannot
conceive it possible that a difference re
garding the franchise or representation
can justify the extensive- and ever-in
creasing military preparations being
made upon the borders not only of the
Transvaal but also upon those of the Free
j State, and is therefore reluctantly com
| pelled to conclude that they must be in
: tended to secure objects, a knowledge of
' which might induce the Free State to
; make representations to secure their at
! tainment.
In conclusion President Steyn says he
! trusts the Imperial Government may see
j its way clear, pending further negotia
j tions, to stop further movements for the
. increase of troops, and that he would be
glad to be favored with the views of the
, Imperial Government regarding tho pre
! else nature and scope of the concessions
or measures: which it suggests as neces
. sary or sufficient to secure satisfaction and
permanent solution of the existing differ
! ences. '. ': 'vV.;;,'.: ".
! On October 1 President Steyn informed
, Sir Alfred Mllner that he deemed It ad
j visable. in order. to allay the intense ex
citement of the burghers arising from the
continued increase and â ' movements of
troops, to summon the burghers, and he
repeats his offer of aid in securing a
friendly settlement. -
Replying on the same date, Sir . Alfred
Mllner expresses regret at the calling out
of the burghers and refers to the mobili
zation of the Transvaal forces on the i
Natal border as indicating the intention
to Immediately invade the Queen's do
minion.
President Steyn on the same date ex
pressed his conviction that the action of
the Transvaal is only the natural result
of the continued Increase of the British
force and the movement In the direction
of the Transvaal border. Sir Alfred Mil
ner replied on October A that all the move
ments of the troops were necessitated by
the natural alarm felt by the Inhabitants
of the exposed districts and declared that
these movements were not comparable in
magnitude' with the recent massing of
armed Transvaal forces on the borders of
Natal. -â¢;â¢â¢-: ; -. :,";?:' .
President Steyn, replying on October 3,
says he does not consider that there are
even fair grounds for the movement of
the British troops, and .he believes the
increasing military preparations retarded
the efforts of himself and all those who
were sincerely working to maintain peace
and effect a fair settlement. He wished
to place on record his earnest conviction
that on those In authority who introduced
the military element and who had since
continued a policy of menace and inter
vention will rest â  the responsibility
should all efforts fall to secure peace and
an honorable settlement. He further says
he cannot but recognize the fact that in
view of the action of the British authori
ties the Transvaal Government cannot be
blamed for acting as it has done, and he
is the more confirmed in this view by the|
fact that while he is still without a replyl
to his communication of September 27 thel
reasonable requests contained therein to
stay the Increase' and movement of troops
which probably would have prevented the
calling out/of the burghers in the repub
lics has not only been \ ignored but the
activity In military preparations and the

MANIFOLD USES FOR
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
Among Other Marvelous Achieve 3
ments Marconi Announces That
He Can Send Pictures by
the System.
"Could wireless telegraphy be applied to the sending of
pictures?"
"Certainly. Given time sufficient for the installation of
plants, 1 would guarantee to transmit through the air a picture,
perfect in outlines, of the finish between the Shamrock and
-oiumbia-" â Extract from an interview with Signor Marconi.
NEW YORK. Oct. R.â Wireless teleg
raphy is destined to play an im
portant part in every day life of
the future. This is the consensus
of expert opinion as gathered by
the Herald from many leading
electricians, including Thomas A. Edison
and Signor Marconi. Unable to supersede
telegraphy by wire or submarine cable,
since there can be no general guarantee
of secrecy for dispatches and operations
are at present limited to short distances,
the wireless system will yet occupy a field
which these other methods ot transmis
sion by electricity cannot fill.
For communication between ships at
sea, especially when in distress, and be
tween ship and the shore, to transmit
news or give warnings, wireless telegra
phy is likely to prove one of humanity's
greatest boons. When ordinary tele
graphic communication has been lost as
the result of storm, the wireless system
may be of important use as a temporary
substitute. Military and naval authori
ties hold that the new system will be an
important factor in future operations. In
directing the movements of a scattered
squadron, when ordinary signaling is im
practicable, to communicate between
forces in the field when miles apartâ
these are very obvious uses.
"He succeeded where I failed." This is
the tribute paid to Signor Marconi by
Thomas A. Edison. Edison was inter
viewed to-day at his home in Llewellan
Park, and he consented to talk about
wireless telegraphy. Edison said:
"There is certainly a great future ahead
of it. What that future may be no one
can say. It would seem as if we were
approaching the limit, but, then, so it was
thought a long time ago. Marconi has
proved that the electrical waves can be
jumped around the curvature of the earth
and this has heretofore been an insupera
ble obstacle. With this accomplished,
there Is apparently no end to the dis
tances that can be overcome. So far it
seems as if about 200 miles was the limit,
but yet even this distance may be as
nothing in the future."
- "Is the system a new one, or is It only
an adaptation of" old principles?"
"The idea is not new, and others have
been experimenting along the line. I had
patents out on this line long before we
heard of Marconi. I tried the experiment
at Menlo years ago and kept at it for a
long time, but I could not get over the
obstacle of the curvature of the earth.
and about two miles was the limit that
I could reach. Telegraphing from mov
ing trains was In line of my invention,
but I and all others ran up against ob
stacles that could not be overcome."
"What is your estimate of the practical
value of the invention?"
"Well, It will prove of great value in
a maritime direction, but I cannot say
that as at present developed it will be of
much value in land operations. The sys
tem can bo made of great practical use
in sea service by stationing vessels or
tugs a certain number of miles apart, but
near enough to each other to come within
the sphere of electrical Influence. In this
way lines of communication could be es
tablished for a thousand miles or more.
Islands could be connected in this way,
or perhaps groups of such Islands brought
Into close communication with each other.
It Is possible that some valuable use
might be made of the system on land, and
indeed some time ago in maneuvers of the
British army and fleet the wireless sys
tem worked well. Possibly the use of
aeroplane kites in connection with the
system may be found to have a practical
value. All this is yet to be developed."
"Are you working at all on this line?"
the Inventor was asked.
"No," he replied. "I gave the whole
thing up years ago and have dismissed it
from my mind. Perhaps one of these days
I may take It up again, but that is a con
tingency too remote to speak of."
Signor Marconi said to-day:
"Two years ago one of the most learned
electricians in all England said that be
yond a distance of half a mile wireless
signals could not be exchanged. At that
time I had been successful at a greater
distance, but I was then of the opinion
that the limit would be about ten miles.
Now we are operating between stations
one hundred and ten miles apart. In the
very near future I will have ready what
Is knewn as the deflector. It has already
been perfected, but for personal reasons
I have not yet given It to the public. By
means of the deflector ships will be able

to safety.
"In England the lighthouses are already
using wireless telegraphy. My plan is to
have all ships equipped with signaling
machines and deflectors. It will then be
possible to send signaling currents all in
one direction instead of broadcast, as is
now done. The deflectors will be revolved
about the mast, and as the currents reach
the point from which they are sent to the
receiver an indicator will ring and the
pilot> may steer his vessel along a safe
course, being guided by signals from
shore."
Signor Marconi was asked whether he
had any knowledge of the telediagraph In
vention which is being used by the Her
ald to send and receive pictures by wire.
"Oh, yes," he said, "I have given it
some study, and it is in its way a won
der. Like wireless telegraphy, it has yet
to be brought to its fullest perfection, but
even now it is capable of great practical
results."
"Could wireless telegraphy be applied
to the sending of pictures?"
"Certainly. Given time sufficient for the
installation of plants, I would guarantee
to transmit through the air a picture per
fect in outlines of the finish between the
Shamrock and Columbia."
WASHINGTON, Oct. B.â is . under
stood that the cruiser New York and bat
tleship Texas will be equipped with in
struments and a shore station will be es
tablishced at Atlantic Highlands. Ex
periments have already been made by the
life-saving service, but the result has not
been decisive. If satisfactory, life-saving
stations and lighthouses will probably be
equipped with the instruments.
The experiments to be made by the
army and navy will be exhaustive. To
quote officials, the yacht race reports have
shown that the system is practicable for
general operation at sea. It only re
mains to prove whether it will be satis
factory for naval and military purposes.
If a success it will be adopted by the
navy, and the army in the Philippines will
be equipped with instruments. The light
house and life-saving services would also
adopt it, and merchantmen will be ad
vised to equip their ships in order that
they may communicate with shore in case
of disaster.
Naval experiments will be made under
the general direction of Rear Admiral
Farquhar, who will succeed Rear Admiral
Sampson in command of the North Atlan
tic squadron. Officers now witnessing the
operations of the system in connection
with the yacht races will conduct experi
ments at sea. Speaking of the matter to
day Admiral Bradford said:
"There is no question of its prospectve
value. I am not yet prepared, however,
to say how great that value will be. Offi

have not submitted their reports."
Colonel James Allen, acting chief signal
officer of the army, states that the two
automobiles recently bought will De used
in the army experiments. Small balloons
and kites will be employed and their use
may increase the distance over which a
message can be sent. He said:
"The value of wireless telegraphy in
creases with distance. Thus, if a message
can be sent fifty miles and given a value,
for instance, of two, its dispatch over
one hundred miles would make the sys
tem worth four. Should the system op
erate satisfactorily over one hundred
miles communication by wireless teleg
raphy could be maintained between Key
West and Cuba, between the islands of
the Hawaiian group and between some
of the .islands of the Philippine archi
pelago. The best results with the system
have thus far been obtained over water.
No satisfactory results have been secured
over a wooded country. Naturally we
are hopeful that the experiments will
show that the system can be operated
on land. It will then be highly valuable
in maintaining communication between
operating columns, between such columns
and their base and between the besieged
and their friends. In case the system
proves successful Instruments and the
necesary appliances will be sent to Ma
nila."
chief Moore of the Weather Bureau is
another Government official who is watch
ing the experiments with wireless teleg
raphy with much interest. Officials of the
bureau look forward to the possible use
of the invention in gathering Information
regarding the weather and sending out
forecasts and storm warnings.

BOY WHO TRIED TO
MURDER HIS PLAYMATES
Twelve- Year-Old Louis Ragio About to Be
Tried at Salinas on Several
Serious Charges.
SALINAS, Oct. B.â There is no doubt
now but what Louis Ragio.. the. .-
ear-old son of Philip Hapio r,f Santa
Rita, a small town east of â¢ this city,
Is the worst boy In this pari of thi State.
For a long time Ragio has been called
"the terror of Santa Rita," but now the
terror of Monterey County Is by far a
more befitting title.
Rag although young In years, is old
In crime, his latest offense being horse
stealing. This crime, added to that of at
tempting to murder three little mates
and various other offenses, if all are
brought to trial, will cause the lad a long
term of punishment.
On May 2 three small boys were playing
near their homes in Santa Rita. Ragio
joined them, whereupon the bids, who
had been forbidden by their parents to
r.ssoriate with him, asked that he leave,
telling the reason. Ragio insisted, and
the boys as vehemently objected, where
upon the bad boy said, "I'll fix you." and
going to his own home he secured his
father's shotgun, loaded 11 with birdshot
and approaching within about fifty feet
of the boys fired. The shot took effect In
all three, but, fortunately, the injured
ads recovered.
Rapio was captured, taken into court
and placed under heavy bonds. Ills case
has been postponed on various occasions,
and the other day it coming to the boy's
ears thai he would soon be brought into
court he attempted to jump his bail and
escape. He stole a horse and with it
reached Aromas, where he was captured.
He Is now lodged In the County Jail and
various charges will be placed against
him. The charge of having tried to take
the life of his playmates is to come up
this week.
Eouis Ragio Is a half-breed Mexican and
Indian. His father has been In numerous
Fc:apes and lias served time in State
prison. Evidently bad blood will show
up despite all attempts to keep It hidden.
JOSEPH MARTELLA
HAS DISAPPEARED
Many Believe Rancher
Was Murdered.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
POINT REYES STATION, Oct. B.â The
name of Joseph Martella, a prominent
rancher and politician of this place, has
been added to the long list of those who
suddenly disappeared. Martella has been
missing since last Monday under peculiar
circumstances, leaving his friends in
doubt whether he has gone of ' his own
accord, committed suicide or was mur
dered.
The missing rancher owns 2000 acres of
land In this vicinity and is reputed to be
very wealthy. He has always taken a
keen Interest in politics i nd far years has
attended the Democratic county conven
tions as a delegate. It is alleged that for
some time he has had a good deal of
trouble with his wife and consequently
has been In a gloomy frame of mind.
Last Monday Martella went to San Ra
fael, taking with him considerable coin,
and consulted an attorney as regards
â winding up his financial affairs. No defin
ite agreement was reached, but from thai
day to this nothing has been seen or
heard from the rancher. The affair was
reported to the, authorities to-day, and a
deputy sheriff will arrive to-morrow to
make an Investigation.
Few Incline to the suicide theory, and
fewer to the belief that Martella has
"skipped," as no disposition has been
made of his property. The authoiities
generally are favorable to the murder
theory on account' of die money the
rancher had on his person when he dis
appeared.
TRIAL OF GAMBLERS
ON THE GEORGEANNA
Criminals Who Robbed Passengers
on the Boat During the Yacht
Race Held.
NEW YORK. Oct. B.â The thirteen men
alleged to have been participants in the
riot which occurred Saturday aboard the
Philadelphia steamer Georgeanna, were
arraigned to-day before a city magistrate.
Captain C. A. Norton of Hartford.
Conn., who organised the committee of
passengers which took possession of the
steamboat and held the gang of gamb
lers and blacklegs at bay until the boat
reached her pier, was present to prose
cute the men who had stabbed at him
and threatened to throw him overboard.
With him were several other, passengers.
The prisoners were Captain Alexander
Sterlck of the Georgeanna; his pilots
Henry B. Post and Daniel Brown, and
Charles Berry, who had chartered the
boat and the other alleged gamblers, Ed
ward P. Sherman, Prank Jones, John
Wills, George Lyons, Charles Valdwln,
William Sims. William H. Cutler, Robert
Stone and James Martin.
The evidence against Berry, described
as the ringleader of the gang, showed that
Berry was a desperate character and that
he had slashed captain Norton's coat
with a knife in an effort to stab him
Berry was held In $2000 for further exam
ination on Wednesday. Sherman, charged
with splitting open the scalp of Peter Per
due, was held In $1000 ball for examination
on the same day.
Captain Norton's testimony, which was
corroborated by the other witnesses, sat
isfied the magistrate that Captain Sterick
was aware that the boat had been chart
ered by gamblers and t...it he was under
their orders. Norton testified that the
captain told him he could go only where
the men running the far... roulette, wheels
of fortune and dice games In the different
parts of tho boat wanted him. The pris
oner, however, when questioned, denied
any knowledge of the gambling. He was
fined $10, and as the witnesses all say
that the pilots had behaved themselves
during the excitement they were dis
charged. On complaint of a 'civil and me
chanical engineer, Sterick, Brown and
Post would be arrested for taking the
ship out to sea without a license.
During the examination it was testified
that the gamblers forcibly robbed pas
sengers of their watches, Jewelry and
pocketbooks and escaped before the police

RODE THE CREST
OF A TIDAL WAVE
Trying Experience of the
General Siglin.
Fecial Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Oct.' B.â lt is not given to
many men to ride a terrific tidal wave
of an earthquake in a 100-ton schooner
and live to tell the story, much less is it
given to them to secure kodak pictures
of the resistless, on-rushing wall of water
as 11 sweeps down upon them, yet M. D.
Balsar of Tacoma has done both.
Balsar arrived yesterday. It was on his
return from Cook Inlet in September that
be encountered a tidal wave caused by
an Alaska earthquake. With thirty-six
others he took passage from Cook Inlet
on the schooner General Siglln. They were
about twenty-five miles off shore from
Cape Elizabeth at noon of September 9.
The day was beautiful and the surface of
the -â  a was smooth and unruffled, when
suddenly a gigantic wave, swelled up, ap
parently from beneath the vessel, and the
calm waters were Instantly lashed into a
yeast of foaming crests. While the start
led passengers were watching the heaving
waters one of them uttered a startled cry
and pointed eastward toward the shore.
Everybody looked and saw a tremendous
wave fully fifty feet high sweeping down
upon them with inconceivable rapidity.
Balsar seized his kodak and took a hasty
snap-shot at it, but the vessel had al
ready felt the influence of the wave and
pitched over on her side, thus In a meas
ure spoiling the picture.
The next Instant the schooner was lifted
and to the startled passengers it seemed
as though they had commenced a trip to
the sun. An instant later and they were
sinking again, down deep into the caver
nous Jaw of the waters. The rolling of
the ship was frightful and all the passen
gers were compelled to seek refuge In
their cabins, although the captain bravely
stood at the wheel. One moment the ves
sel would be lying on her beam ends, the
next the bowsprit would make a sudden
dive toward the bottom and the next the
taffrall would be taking a hath. Many
passengers thought their last hour had
come. Some prayed, other stoically await
ed their fate
The huge tidal wave was quickly fol
lowed by others from shoreward. Tho
Siglln pitched and tossed all the after
noon, but manged to ride them safely.
The churning of the water continued until
after sundown. 'When darkness came on
a storm sprang up and the barometer fell
two points. All sails were reefed and
through the night high seas kept running.
This continued until 11 o'clock the next
day. when the wind subsided and the best
kind of weather was thereafter experi
enced to Puget Sound. Though knowing
nothing of the earthquake on shore the
passengers believed the tidal wave had
been caused by seismic disturbances.
BOSTON SWELL CLUB
RAIDED BY POLICE
Millionaires of the Hub Taken to
Prison for Taking Part in a
Game of Poker.
BOSTON, Oct. The Oxford Club, j
formerly the Suffolk Club, a well-known j
social organization, wan raided at mid
night Saturday and thirty-six of Boston's
wealthiest and most prominent citizens
were arrested on the charges of gambling
and being present where gambling was In ;
progress. The majority of these men
are millionaires, and there Is the greatest
excitement to-day because of the strenu
ous efforts being made to keep the affair I
from becoming public.
A steep game of poker was In progress ;
and $4000 in chips were seized. â¢ The men j
arrested were taken to the station and
gave assumed names. They depostied '
cash ball and were all released. None of
them will appear in court to-morrow, i
their bail will be forfeited and the case j
will be hushed up completely, as there
seems no doubt that sufficient influence
can be brought to bear to prevent prose
cution by default. If this cannot be done
there will be an exodus of leading Bos
tonians for fall pleasure resorts. The cli
max to the sensation, however, is the an
nouncement that a former prominent and
wealthy citizen of Boston committed sui
cide a few days ago because he lost the
last remnant of his fortune, $7000, In this
same club only a few days ago.
Cannot Find Wright.
LARKSPUR, Oct. B.â C. W. Wright,
president of the local water company, has j
been playing at hide-and-seek with a j
Dumber of Deputy Sheriffs, and their ef
forts to hold a brief conference with him
have resulted in naught. The Intention
of the oillcers is to serve a writ of man

Wright to supply Mrs. Kate G. Record

CHICAGO, Oct. B.â The Tribune
says: Word came to local Demo
cratic circles to-day that if Chair
man Jones of the Democratic Na
tional Committee could have his
way Chicago would not be the
headquarters of that committee
pending or after th.- national con
tention. The report is that Chair
man Jones wants to take the head
quarters to Washington and the
general idea is that he will, do as
he pleases about It. The reason
given for selecting Washington for
the home of the committee is that
its work can be more easily accom
plished at the nation's capital.
NEW YORK. Oct. B.â United States
Senator James K. Jones of Arkansas,
chairman of the National Democratic
Committee, and wife were passengers on
the Cunard liner Lucania, that reached
New York City to-day. They have been
traveling in England, Ireland, Scotland,
Switzerland and Wales for several
months. Senator Jones said he had been
greatly improved by his travels, and felt
able to go into the work necessary in get
ting ready for the Pres.dentlal campaign.
Senator Jones, when asked to give his
views on the political 'situation, said that
owing to his long absence abroad he was
not as fully informed as to political con
ditions as he hoped to be in a lew weeks.
When asked his opinion as to the proba
bility of the Democratic nomination for
the Presidency going to W. J. Bryan he
said: â¢ '"â ' '- '--â -â 
"There is no doubt that Bryan will re
ceive the Democratic nomination for Pres
ident," and added, "has anybody any
doubt on that question? Bryan is sure to
j win." â â 'â¢'â â 'â  ' : ','''-''
On the attitude of Richard Croker as to
the nomination of Bryan for President,
Senator Jones had little to say, merely re
plying to a direct question: "Croker is al
ready in line."
As to the possible outcome of the na
tional campaign of 1900, Senator Jones said
he believed that the free silver idea would
have a greater following than in the cam
paign of 1896. He based this assertion on
the tact that the Democratic party would
receive support in 1900 from a new source.
"In 1896," he said, "there were many
Republicans and others who believed that
when the Republican party declared for
bimetallism the declaration was made in
all sincerity. These men now doubt the
sincerity of that plank of the Republican
platform."
When asked what effect he thought the
I apparent prosperity in the Western States
would have on Democratic Issues, Sen
ator Jones said:
"Yes, I know they say at Washington
; that the country is in a highly prosperous
\ condition, and perhaps that is correct
from certain standpoints. But I cannot
Bee that there Is any great material pros
perity among the agricultural and simi
lar classes. It does not appear to have
affected the farmer, nor has it done much
as yet for the laboring man in general.
Cotton and wheat have not made any ad
i vance to speak of in price. That argu
ment can be readily answered when the
time comes. Of course, there has been
; an increase in the output of gold, and
that Is bound to affect politics In some de
: gree, greater or less. But that is only
! a proof of the arguments advanced by us
in 1896, that what the country needed was
a greater volume of money in circulation."
When asked what effect he thought the
alleged prosperity would have on the vot
ers- in general, he said, in emphatic tones:
I "It will affect only those men who are
very narrow in their political and social
views. That voter It will influence, but
; In reality It will be an argument in favor
of our party."
He said that It was his opinion that the
opposing Presidential, candidate in 1900
would be President McKlnley. The Demo
cratic platform, he declared, would be
launched In that year on comparatively
the same basis and contain essentially the
same planks as In 1896. The party would
i declare for free silver at the same ratio,
j and he thought about the only addition
I to or change in the party platform of any
; moment would be a plank relative to antl
i Imperialism. That, he asserted, would un
i doubtedly be one of the Important issues
;In the campaign. He refused to discuss
, the matter any more than to say, with a
I wave of the hand, "Everybody knows
! what Imperialism means. The question
1 under discussion means Just the reverse."
During the afternoon and evening sev-
I eral men prominent In public life called
;on Senator Jones. Among them was
George Frederick Williams of Massachu
setts, and it Is presumed there was a con
ference over political matters and plans
! for the coming campaign.
STRUCK A YOUNG
LADY IN THE FACE
De Los Noble Roughly Handled by
an Infuriated Mob in
Sausalito.
SAUSALITO, Oct. 8.-De Los Noble, a
member of the local brass band, was
nearly beaten to death to-day by a crowd
of Infuriated citizens because of a
cowardly and brutal assault made by him
on a respectable young lady. He was
sneaked out of the crowd by several of
his friends, who succeeded In securing his
release by strategy and hurried him
away in time to save his life.
Noble had just come off the steamer
San Rafael, which had been on an ex
cursion around the bay, when he met
Miss Vlera. the sister of Fireman Manuel
Vlera, and struck her a powerful blow
In the face, knocking the girl to the
floor. Cornelius Mahar, the nearest wit
ness, promptly felled Noble, and a crowd
rushed In with shouts of "kill him,"
"lynch the coward," and buffeted Noble
around for several minutes before he was
torn away and carried off in a bloody
and semi-conscious condition by a few
of the cooler heads. Manuel Vlera tried
to brain Noble, but was restralnd.
It Is alleged by her relatives that
Noble's assault was due to the young
lady refusing to keep company with him
longer for good reasons. Noble was per
fectly sober when he committed the deed.
More trouble is expected over the affair.

settlement of 'trade disputes. The ad-'
vantages of an extension of International ;

COVERED WITH A PISTOL,
JOCKEY WINS THE RACE
Backers of a Mare Take Effective Steps
to Prevent the Boy From Throw
ing the Contest,
GRIDLEY Cal., Oct. B.â With a cocked .revolver pointed straight at his
head and following his every move. Jockey Norman Breedin literally ' rode
for his life" to-day, and on George Brown's mare Flora B passed under -the
wire a winner in one of the most sensational horse races probably ever wit
nessed on a track. : : IV a ii". Â»
The revolver which so effectually aided In the determination of the race
was held by one of the backers of the mare. Shortly before the horses went
to the post'lt was rumored that Breedin had been paid to throw the race. One
of the men who had bet on Flora B, just as the boy got into the saddle,
significantly informed him that he had better ride to win. Another man, who
also had placed his money on the mare, took his position at the turn where,
as Breedin flashed by, he displayed a gun. As the jockey came into the
stretch he was covered by a revolver, pointed by a third backer of Flora B.
Immediately the boy went to work on his mount with whip and heels with
such good effect that the mare passed under the wire well in the lead of
the two other horses that took part In the running.
About $600 changed hands on the race.

noon the mercury registered 92 degrees.
At 5 o'clock it had fallen to 82.
SAN JOSE, Oct. The hottest weather
of the season was that experienced to
day. The thermometer reached 94 and 9o i
in the sha^e. No damage will result to
the grapes unless the intense heat con
tinues for several days. The heat was
probably made more intense by the big i
forest fires in the mountains and the j
smoke.
MONTEREY. Oct. B.â To-day has been
one of the hottest ever known in this vi- I
cinity, the ,mercury registering as high
as SI degrees in the shade at noon. In
Corrale de Tarra and outlying districts
the heat was considerably greater than
here and in Pacific Grove, owing to the
forest fires in the adjacent mountains.
SONOMA, Oct. To-day has been the
hottest ever known In this valley. Ther- '
mometers in business houses and private
residences registered this afternoon be
tween 108 and 115 in the shade. The hot
wave struck the valley last night, and so
oppressive was me atmosphere that
breathing became difficult. If this heat
continues much damage will result to the
grape crop. Already many vineyards have ;
suffered from the effects of sunburn. .
STOCKTON, Oct. B.â A hot wave was
experienced here to-day. The thermom
eter registered 93. '
DAWSON DESERTED
FOR CAPE NOME
Tales of Gold Cause a Stampede
From the Klondike
Capital.
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. B.â News was
brought by the steamer Tees, which ar
rived this evening from Lynn canal with
120 passengers and $50,000 in gold, that a
stampede is now on in earnest from Daw
son to Cape Nome. When the miners who
arrived by the Tees left the Klondike cap
ital river steamers were being left with
out crews because of the stampede, the
seamen deserting to join the great crowd
hurrying down the river to the new El
Dorado. â¢ ~.
On two of the Canadian Development
Company's steamers the captains were
obliged to call on the mounted police to
hold their crews until they were ready to
sail for the White Horse. Both vessels
made a long trip up the river, one occupy
ing eleven and the other fourteen days.
As the wood piles were deserted the crews
were obliged to go ashore and cut wood
to fuel up at every landing.
What caused the rush toward Nome
was the arrival of several Dawsonians
who had gone down In the rush of last
July with considerable gold, which they
had washed from the beach at Nome.
When they exhibited the gold at Dawson
there was considerable excitement, as the
stories that had been received there from
Nome were conflicting. That night a
stampede began, and when those who ar
rived to-night left the rush was still on.
According to the miners from Dawson,
there has been a. wholesale. blanketing of
promising gold territory in' the Klondike
by the Government. Miners have been or
dered off 1060 miles of territory, and this
exclusive of the reservations of the Gov
ernment at El Dorado and Bonanza.
It seems that immediately upon the ap
plication for ground for hydraulic pur
poses the ground is closed for. entry un
der the placer regulations, and under the
guise that the land Is to be taken up by
hydraulic concerns the Government has
taken a large amount of ground from the
miners.
Navigation will close next week on tho
upper river, and the steamers will go Into
winter quarters near White Horse.
There was ojily one more vessel to come
up when the Tees left. When about eight
hours from Skaguay the Tees struck on
Eldred rock. She was floated about ten
hours later. Her hull is damaged and she
will be hauled out.*
Fears are entertained for the safety of
the steamer Princess Louise, plying be

AFTER NEXT THURSDAY
An Agreement by Which the Shamrock and, Colum
bia Are to Compete Until the Question of Inter
national Yachting Supremacy Is Decided*
NEW YORK, Oct. 6.â By a mutual
agreement between the representa
tives of the New York Yacht Club
and the Royal Ulster Yacht Club,
the Columbia and Shamrock will
sail every day after next Thursday until
the question of international yachting su
premacy is established.
The request for such an arrangement
came from Sir Thomas Lipton, owner of
the challenger. Sir Thomas wanted the
races to be sailed daily after next Tues
day, but the members of the New York
Yacht Club refused to assent to such an
arrangement.
The meeting at which the arrangement
for a change in the dates was reached
was held at the New York Yacht Club to
day. There were present R. Sharman
Crawford and H. McGlll Downey, repre
senting the Royal Yacht Club, and Lewis
Cass Ledyard, J. V. S. Oddie, F. W.
Ilurst. Edward M. Brown and H. F. Lip
pltt. representing the New York Yacht
Club. At the conclusion of the meeting
tho following agreement was drawn up
and given out for publication:
"The foregoing agreement (the challenge
agreement) is further modified by mutual
consent as follows:
"Strike out the clause beginning 'the
first ..ice shall be sailed on Tuesday,
October 3, 1599.* and substitute the follow
ing: 'The i ices shall be sailed on the fol
lowing dates until the series be com
pleted:
" 'October 10, 1599: October 12. and on
each following day except Sunday; pro
vided, however, that immediately on the
conclusion of the race on October 12, and
of each subsequent race, the regatta com
mittee shall Inquire of each contestant
whether he is willing to start the next
day, and should both contestants answer
in the negative one day shall intervene
before starting the next race. Sunday
shall not be counted as such intervening
day.' "
The agreement was signed by the mem
bers of the committees representing both
yacht clubs interested.
At the conclusion of the meeting Secre
tary Oddie said:
"In case the boats sail on the day fol
lowing a race the committee boat will dis
play the international code letter 'L.' of
blue and yeliOW squares. If there is to
be no race the letter 'M,' blue with diag
onal white stripes, will be displayed from
the committee boat. The club suggests
that each yacht and boat present take up
and display the signal given by the com
mittee boat.
"There was no friction In reach- the
agreement as to the change of dates. Sir
Thomas Lipton at first asked that the
races be started daily after Tuesday. The
club decided that this would hardly be
prudent. In the first place, it would be
entirely unfair to the public. Thousands
of persons have made arrangements to at
tend the races on a certain day. Hun
dreds of excursions have been arranged
for, and to make a change In the racing
dates on so short a notice would not be
right to the public.
"The club is deeply grateful for the
manner In which the public has been act
ire at th( races. There has been no in
terference with the boats whatever. The
club Is grateful to the public for this, and
It would not be right to make such a
sudden change In racing days. We are
endeavoring to please the public as well
as the visitors."
LIPTON'S LADS EXPECT
TO CAPTURE THE CUP
NEW YORK. Oct. B.â Shamrock stock
has ken another rise. There is a feel
ing about town to-night that the historic
cup is In greater danger than ever beore.
The more yesterday's performance Is con
sidered and discussed, the less encourag
ing it seems to the American yachtsmen.
The Shamrock is a wonder in light
weather. That is settled beyond a doubt
by the three lays of drifting. She has
surprised her own people and has given
the. other people a great shock. She
handles splendidly and has men on board
who know how to do the handling. The
feeling of the American yachtsmen that
the challenger was entering the races un
prepared and untried has disappeared.
They have seen her fit for the struggle,
and they know that she Is ready to do her
best. In response to an inquiry made this
nfternoon as to what was being done by
way of preparation, her managers said:
"Nothing. There she Is, ready for the
gun."
Each side is confident, but it must be
admitted that the backers of the green
boat are, showing the most hope. They
say they know what she can do in heavy
weather. It only required three days of
drift to convince them that she was" just
as good In light air. The whole Shamrock
contingent is happy and there is no one to
begrudge them their pleasant moments.
The Columbia people are not unhappy by ;
any means. On the contrary, they still
confidently assert that, of course, the cup
stays. But they have been shocked and ;
they have been shocked in a most de- 1
clslve manner. They know there will be i
no walkover. They know more than this, !
' l
WILL REMAIN IN
ACTIVE SERVICE
Admiral Dewey Not to
Seek Retirement.
Special Dispatch to The Call
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Oct. B.â
Admiral Dewey, has determined to remain
on the active list of the United States
navy. Reports have been current since
the admiral's return that he would apply
for retirement either on December 26 next,
when he will reach the usual retiring ago
of 62 years, or immediately thereafter.
Information recently obtained shows that
the admiral Intends to stay in active serv
ice. Were he to be retired he would suf
fer a Loss of $1500 a year, the allowance he
now receives for quarters, and the serv
ices of a naval aid and secretary. It is
the expectation of the department that
the admiral will remain on duty with the
Philippine Commission during the winter
and that Congress will call on him fre
quently to give advice concerning the
Philippines as well as other matters.
RETURNS THANKS FOR
DEWEY'S SAFE RETURN
WASHINGTON, Oct. B.â Admiral Dewey
to-day attended , divine services at St.
John's Episcopal Church, where the Epis
copal ceremony of prayer and thanksgiv
ing for the crown of victory our arms
and the safe return from sea, was con
ducted. The admiral and the church of
ficials advised giving no notice in advance
of this service in order to avoid the cu
rious crowd that would flock to the
church. The rector in his sermon made
no allusion to the admiral, but impres
sively delivered the two formal prayers
! but they are not telling what It Is. Leav
| ing entirely out of the question American
I pride in the American boat, all true
I sportsmen are rejoicing. Here is a con
; test worth having. Here Is a yacht race
i that Is worth all the money that has been
! spent, all the time and' care that have
: been given. It is a great struggle, and no
man can name the winner. This is the
feeling in New YorK to-day, and this is a
gain for the Shamrock side, for did she
j not start the week a bad second?
The betting is still slightly In the Co
-1 lumbia's favor, but this is net based on
the judgment of yachting experts. There
is more Columbia money to be had be
cause of local pride and this Is the influ
| encing factor in the matter of odds.
Both yacals are still at the Hook to
! day. It was a day of rest on the racers,
! Mr. Iselln and his friends coming to
! town, leaving Captain Charlie Barr on
! guard.
Sir Thomas Lipton and his friends are
near their boat on the Erin, and there
' they will remain until the last race Is
| over. Sir Thomas said to-day that un-
I der no conditions would he leave the
i Horseshoe until the contests were over,
j lit seemed very much worried about the
I 11,' ness of Mr. Fife, and he Insists that the
| Shamrock is under great disadvantage in
; not having him on board.
The opinion was quite general to-day
that there was something in yacht rac
ing by which a line could be drawn on
the merits of the boats. There was wind
enough for a couple of hours to furnish
! a test, the first real test of the week, and
| while it lasted the boats were under equal
j conditions and the Shamrock did the bet
ter work. That is the reason for the rise
lin the Shamrock stock to-day. She is
j good In a run dead before the wind. She
jis good in a beat to windward. What she
j will do in a reach Is undecided, but the
impressions are against her on this point
of sailing.
Inhere was another high northeaster to
day and the Sandy Hook waters were
| churned up In fine style. On Tuesday the
! struggle will be resumed.
Captain Barr spent the best part of his
day on board the Columbia. Mr. Iselin
left Saturday night with his entire party
of Corinthians, and when the captain
arose this morning it was to the task of
looking after a number of things which
Mr. Iselin himself ordinarily attends *o.
All the Columbia's sails were unbent on
j Saturday night, but at that time it was
I expected that one of the morning tasks
i would be to set them again. The Sun
! day trial has always been a feature up
ito this time. The state of weather to-day
j spoiled all hope along that line and the
I men did not seem to mind the priva-
I tion.
Stripped of her canvass the defender
: looked very bare. She was headed into
the gale, or as much of it as got Inside
the Hook, and the man forward on watch
kept under the lee as well as he could.
Captain Earr spent most of his time
below. Altogether the day was a dreary
one. There was nothing left for the men
to do but to 101 lon the tender and wish
for a breeze on Tuesday. Last Sunday
i they had plenty of visitors who cheered
; the boat. These crafts were missing to
day. The Sandy Hook boat came along-
side and those on board saluted the de
fender. The Hook was deserted to-day
except for the newspaper boats. In spite
of all the past fizzles the sailor men on
the Columbia still seem confident of suc
cess. The presence of the Shamrock near
by simply makes them more firm In their
belief of victory when a real trial comes.
The race of Saturday operated as a tonic
on them all. Up to that time they had
heard so much about their skipper being
outgeneraled that some of them may have
begun, perhaps, to fear that there might
be something In t. The Saturday race,
to their mind, however, showed them a
different phase and every one on board
felt that they would show the English
skippers yet what was possible. The men
had no other comment to make on the
race. The policy of those in charge of the
defender Is not to talk at all, and the men
follow the implied instructions to the let
ter.
The programme of Monday Is one of
rest. The men will do some little work in
the line of making surer, but It is not ex
pected that the Columbia will go out to
sea at all, and the energy will be re
served for Tuesday's race.
Sir Thomas Lipton spent the greater
part of to-day on board the old schooner
yacht America as the guest of Lieutenant
Colonel Butler Ames. He rose early not
withstanding the fatigue of yesterday's
race, and after breakfast spent a couple
of hours reading the newspapers. Then he
went on board the America in one of the

Colorado, Is Dead.
DENVER, Oct. B.â George Trltch, the
millionaire hardware dealer of this city
and owner of the largest establishment of
Its kind In Colorado, died hero this after

He leaves a widow and five children. Mr.

born In Baden, Germany, in 1829, and was
brought to this country by his parents the

and arriving in Denver in May, 1860. He
immediately opened a shop and plied his
trade as tinner, subsequently putting In a

Idly, necessitating the changing of busi

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1899.
I America, for he had heard much from his
father about the craft that came over
. from America to England forty-eight
i years ago and captured the cup that the
Shamrock has come over to "lift" this
! year. â â ;. ,: â _:
When the America was on the other side
Mr. Ratsey's father saw the craft fre
-1 quently and got his first idea about build
, ing sails that would set flatter than the
type of the English sails, which were cut
baggy at that time. The elder Ratsey
was following the same vocation that his
fathers had followed for generations be-
I fore, that of sallmaklng, ana he admitted
: the America so much that he had a model
I made which Is In the Ratsey office to this
day.
When the America came back to her
anchorage at 2 o'clock Sir Thomas sig
naled for his launch and came over to
the Associated Press yacht Wanda. After
greeting those on board, Sir Thomas' first
words were: "Isn't it singular that we
always get a strong breeze after a race
day?"
The owner of the Shamrock, when seen
later by the Associated Press representa
tive on board his steam yacht Erin, said
i he would like to have a strong breeze for
the contest on Tuesday so that the two
i boats could finish a race, for If they did
j no do so pretty soon he would have to
â  build a house on Sandy Hook. He men
j tioned a dispatch he had ercelved from St.
' Johns, N. F., begging him to come down
j there and sail the races, "where there la
I plenty of wind and lots of water."
Sir Thomas said the crew of his yacht
i were as happy as larks, and they were
i eager to have a try at the Columbia in a
i stiff breeze, for they were more confident
| than ever of winning the cup, now that
they had shown how speedy the Sham
j rock was in light air. â
A dispatch came to Sir Thomas this af
! ternoon from Weather Forecaster Will
; lams of the Weather Bureau in Washing-
I ton, announcing that a heavy northeast
! gale was moving slowly up the coast from
| off North Carolina and that it would be
| dangerous for small boats.
Lying under the lee of Sandy Hook, the
i two racing yachts were well protected
; from the heavy sea running outside, but
. still Sir Thomas deemed It advisable to
' take precautions. His first move was to
! run oveij to the Columbia and notify Cap
tain Barr of the warning that he had re
i ceived from Washington. He also placed
! a tug at Barr's disposal if he cared to
i tow up the harbor out of danger, for the
. : Irish Knight does not want anything to
happen to the cup defender any more than
ihe does to his own boat. Then he came
back to the Erin and instructed Captain
Matthews to keep steam up all night in
case of emergency. He also ordered every
; thing made snug on the Shamrock for the
night.
"I want to say," said Sir Thomas, "that
I shall not leave Sandy Hook until I either
; win or lose the cup. That is what I came
j here for, and I shall make it my only busi
ness. I hope for a good stiff breeze next
: Tuesday, so that the boats can make a
[ race of it, and may the best boat win."
The Shamrock's owner then returned to
: the America and joined Mr. Ames and his
party at lunch. , :
i Admiral Dewey will not be able to see
j Tuesday's race from the Erin. He has so
| many engagements that he finds it Impos
i sible to be present, and so telegraphed Sir
j Thomas to-day.
With the Royal Ulster Yacht Club's
j pennant flapping at her masthead and the
blue ensign of that club at her stern gaff,
i the challenger Shamrock pulled hard at
her mooring buoy in the Horseshoe this
afternoon, for a piping northeast breeze
was whistling through her rigging and
. there was promise of more wind in the
! threatening clouds. Walking the deck was
a blue-uniformed sailor, whose duty it was
i to keep watch over his precious charge.
On board the Erin Captain Matthews,
her commander, stated that the crew of
' the Shamrock, from Skippers Hogarth
i and Wringe â have proven conclusive
j ly their skill at handling the tiller and
; trimming sheetsâ down to the youngest
' sailor were in fine fettle, and more con
tin. nt than ever that the greon sloop,
: which they have all learned to love and
, admire, will win the America's cup for
Sir Thomas Lipton.
Barring accidents, absolutely no change
'. will be made In the challenger. . She Is
j now, as on Wednesday, In the pink of
| condition and stands ready to win or lose
i upon her merits. Her running gear has
been carefully overhauled, and It is said
cannot be. Improved upon, while her sails
i are simply perfection. Sails alone never
i won a race, but where the yachts are as
; evenly matched as they are In this case It
, may mean the extra feather which tips
i the scale In the Shamrock's favor. Be
this as it may, the crew of the green chal
j lenger is eagerly looking forward to the
j next race day, praying for a breeze that
j will afford a true test of the speed of the ;
â¢ yachts. If such a day Is granted and the
Shamrock fails to win, they will be the
! most surprised sailor lads that ever swung
ion a halyard or reefed a sail. In the
! meantime they are taking matters philo
sophically, are In the best of spirits, and j
| no one can say as yet that their confi- i
dence In the beautiful Irish yacht Is mis- j
placed. I
RIVER MYSTERY IN
NEW YORK CITY
Dismembered Body of a
Woman Found.
Special Dispatch to The Ca.lL
â  NEW TORK, Oct. B.â Several parts of
the dismembered body of a woman are
at the Morgue, and the police are investi
gating another river mystery.
In the North River, at the foot of West
Seventeenth street, a man fishing last
night hauled up on his hook a bundle con-
talnlng the trunk of a woman's body.
Early In the morning the left thigh of
a woman, wrapped in several newspapers,
had been found In front of 16 West Seven-
teenth street. It was found that the por
tion of the thigh fitted the dismembered
trunk. Doctors who have examined the
parts are of the opinion that they are
those of a woman probably less than mid
dle age. The newspapers in which the
thigh was wrapped included one of the
date of October 5, showing that the body
had been dismembered on that date or
subsequent to it. There were several
marks on the papers, but the nature of
these the police will not disclose. Several
cuts on the body indicate It had been
hacked. The driver of a furniture van is
suspected and the police are hunting for
him. ''r'ZL.

PRESIDENT ATTENDS
RELIGIOUS SERVICES
CHICAGO, Oct. B.â Sunday was not a
day of rest for President McKinley. The
center of a city's festivities and the one
desired object of numerous committees
and delegations, he was kept busy from
the time of the last puff from his after
breakfast cigar until the last benediction
of the religious services which filled the
day had been given. During the after
noon and evening he attended three re
ligious servicesâ two in the Auditorium
and one in Quinn Chapel, at which latter
place he spoke a few words of greeting
to the enthusiastic colored congregation
there assembled. At the exercises for
children In the Auditorium during the
afternoon the President, in response to
prolonged cheering, said:
"I do not like to interrupt the singing
of the American hymn by making a
speech. I can only express to you the
very great satisfaction It Is to me to wit
ness this magnificent demonstration of
patriotism- and love of God."
The big hall was packed with expectant
humanity and the chief executive listened
attentively to addresses made by Rev.
Samuel B. Barnetz of Dcs Moines, Iowa;
Rev. Father Maurice J. Doorney and the
Rev! J. Arondthaler. He vigorously ap
plauded a mention of Admiral Dewey
made during Father Doorney's speech.
At his apartments In the Auditorium
Annex the President was met by a dele
gation of colored men from Quinn Chapel
and accepted their Invitation to speak a
HAVOC WROUGHT
BY FOREST FIRES
Miles of Valuable Tim
ber Destroyed.
Special IMspatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Oct. B.â A forest fire that
for a week has been threatening property
1 in the Santa Cruz mountains swept over
j the country with great fury to-day as the
! result of the springing up of a high wind.
A large acreage of vineyards were swept
over and destroyed and many houses,
barns and tanks burned near Wrights
! Station. Among those who lost buildings
1 and other property were J. McCracken, E.
i A. Adams. Clyde McKinney, C. 11. Allen.
i John Carr and E. C. Yocco. The big
winery of E. Meyers was saved after hard
fighting by a number of men. It is es
, timated that property to the value of over
! $100,000 was destroyed upon which there is
considerable Insurance. The flames had
not reached Wrights when they died
down for the night, and it is believed that
the railroad and other property there is
I in no more danger.
KESWICK, Oct. B.â For four days for
-1 est fires have been running over the Clear
Creek region west of Shasta, near the
head of Little Salt Creek. They were
starting to burn westward when the wind
changed and drove the fire back toward
the pipeline and flumes of the Princess
Hydraulic Mining company. Property
representing thousands of dollars In value
\ was In danger of destruction. For two
days and nights a large crew of fire-fight
i ers strove to save the valuable property.
It was hot work, but the efforts were sue
: cessful and further danger averted. The
i fire Is well under control now.
COVELO, Oct. B.â Destructive forest
fires are raging from Covelo to Layton
viii,, and Cahto to Westport, sweeping
everything Inflammable In their path.
The damage by the fire to property
owners will exceed $35,000. The losses es
timated include construction material ot
the Pacific telephone and Telegraph
Company, Western Union Telegraph
Company Vassar Lumber Company and
numerous tie and lumber camps. Some
500 fire fighters have maintained a vig
ilant watch for the past twenty-four
hours Many persons were prostrated by
the heat The Odd Fellows' Cemetery at
Laytonville was badly damaged. The flro
Is not yet under control, and Is estimated
to cover about sixty miles.
SANTA CRUZ, Oct. Dense smoke
still obscures the mountains on account
of forest fires. Ashes and cinders fell to
day near this city. The fires near Boulder
Creek are under control and no further
danger Is feared. The fire In the neigh
borhood of Pescadero Creek and In the
direction of Alma apparently continues to
rape fiercely, judging from the immense
volume of smoke arising In that direc
tion The fire is being kept in the under
brush on a territory covering four or five
miles If it is kept there no fear Is felt
for the safety of the tall redwood trees
and cordwood west of the fire. If the
flames should manage to break through
the territory they are now confined to
they would "have plenty of dry material
to feed on and cause much loss. An army
of men is now fighting vlgorusly trying to
prevent Its spread. No reports of heavy

timber and brush fire In the mountains
near Cisco threatened the destruction of
more snowsheds, but the railroad com
pany sent out fire trains and protected

the fire trains holding the track, but the
detention was for only a few hours.
PROTECTING THE BORDER.

Sacramento Wins.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 8. -The ball game
between the Sacramento Athletic- Club
and the Oakland Acme Athletic Club
teams played here to-day was a tame
affair and resulted in a victory for the
local team by a score of 20 to 4. Flege
was touched for seventeen hits, two of
which were home runs. Batteriesâ W.
Newbert und Conway; Fiege and Peralta,
few words to the colored folk. The dimly
lighted little chapel, with its humble ap
pointments, was in strange contrast to
the magnificence of the scene with the
services earlier in the day.
The President said: "My friends, It
gives me very great pleasure to meet
with you on this memorable day. The
noblest sentiments of the human heart
after love of God is love of country, and
that includes love of home, the corner
stone of strength and safety. Your race
has demonstrated its patriotism by its
sacrificesâ lts love of the flag by dying
for It. That is the greatest test of fidel
ity and loyalty. The nation has appre
ciated the valor and patriotism of the
black men of the United States. They not
only fought In Cuba, but in the Philip
pines, and they are carrying the flag as
the symbol of liberty and hope to an op
pressed people?'
After breakfast, which the President
ate with Mrs. McKinley and Miss Bar
ber, Mr. McKinley received Informal calls
from members of the Presidential party.
When the start shortly before noon was
about to be made for the home of La
fayette McWllllams, where President and
Mrs. McKinley and Miss Barber had ar
ranged to dine, Mrs. McKinley upset the
plans of the arrangement committee. The
committee had planned that Charles
Truax. B. J. Rosenthal and E. C. Keith
should ride with the city's distinguished
guests.
At the last moment Mrs. McKinley an
nounced her own desire to have the com
pany of her husband during the ride. The
disappointed trio of committeemen ac
cepted this with good grace and climbed
into a carriage by themselves.
Whenever the President appeared in
his carriage on the street he was fol
lowed by a throng of people in all sorts
of vehicles from the bicycle to the auto
mobile. So persistent and withal so
pretty was little Harry Allen Storm, who,
mounted on his wheel, in his Lord
Fauntleroy toggery, folowed by the Presi
dent, that upon his arrival at the hotel
from the home of Captain McWllllams,
the nation's chief sent for the boy, shook
the lad's hand and covered him with
confusion by his kindly words of greet
ing.
Over 6000 persons were present at the
Auditorium to-night, attending the union
religious service. Hundreds were turned
away. The appearance of President Mc-
Kinley was the signal for wild applause.
The entire audience arose and handker
chiefs waved the Chautauqua salute.
The President stood in his box and bowed
to the audience repeatedly. Mrs. Mc-
Kinley did not attend the services.
The programme opened with Gullmonfs
"Religious March," an organ prelude by
Arthur Dunham. After the offering of
the Lord's prayer by Rev. J. D. Sever
ringhouse, a responsive Bible reading was
led by Bishop Benjamin W. Arnett of
the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
Bishop Samuel Fallows, as chairman of
the meeting, then introduced the Rev.
"William M. Lawrence, who spoke on
"The Moral Power of Chicago." "Damas
cus Triumphal March" was rendered by
the Apollo Musical Club and after an ad
dress by Rev. R. A. White, "The Star
Spangled Banner," by the Apollo Club,
was greeted with much applause.

yourself. On March 20, my dogs got stuck
In rough Ice and I got out of the sled
took off their harness and put it around
my chest and shoulders, Intending to do
my own teaming until the dogs became
more tractable. As I was walking alone
head down and hauling my sled, I put mv
foot into a crack in the Ice eighteen
inches deep and so covered with snow as
to be hidden. My right leg went down
the crevasse, scraping the shinbone and
otherwise Injuring the limb. a
"For eight consecutive days I walked
across the ice thus injured and then fell
exhausted. My companions helped me un
put me on a sledge and dragged me to
the nearest retreat, the headquarters
house at Cape Tegelhoff, where I remain
ed in bed, crippled from April 9 to July 4
In August I went to London for surgical
treatment. I live in the hope that I am
not permanently crippled."

BUSINESS GETTING AHEAD OF CASH
SOME weeks ago it was seen that the remarkable
activity in trade was drawing large sums from
the banks into general commercial circulation,
but it was thought that the condition was merely tem
porary. It is now seen, however, that it is becoming
more pronounced and that there is a growing scarcity
of the circulating medium. The stringency has been
most marked in England, and from time to time the
Bank of England has advanced its rate of discount in
order to prevent the outflow of gold to foreign coun
tries and especially America, ami last week two ad
vances were made, raising the rate from 3 / 2 to 5 per
cent, which is very high. The stringency is also
severe in Germany, as shown by the action of the
Bank of Germany in also raising its rate to 6 per
cent. These advances will probably check the exports
of gold to the United States, especially as the Bank of
France has also lost gold heavily of late and is taking
similar measures to keep the yellow coin at home.
Of course these conditions affect New York, where
money is now high, being wanted in large amounts
for speculation and legitimate trade. There is no
real stringency in New York as in the three other
centers, however, in spite of the high rates of interest,
some borrowers being compelled to pay to(Â§ 15 per
cent, while 8(o!io per cent were the easiest rates ob
tainable last week. Many operators considered these
high rates altogether unnecessary and the result of
manipulation, but it is admitted that 6 per cent will
be the minimum rate for some weeks to come, as New
York is being heavily drawn upon for funds to move
the Western crops. It is believed, however, that in
the early winter months currency will return to New
York a* it usually does when the crops begin to
move, when the money market will naturally ease off.
This, at least, is the expectation of Wall street, which
looks for a quiet stock market until that time arrives.
There is no stringency sufficiently severe, however,
to cause any apprehension. The Transvaal situation
is an important factor in the case, as it is broadly
asserted in some quarters that England needs the gold
mines there to recuperate her diminished supply of
gold, though English authorities pooh-pooh the bare
idlea of such a necessity.
The fact remains, however, that in this country the
needs of a phenomenally active commerce , both
domestic and foreign, arc exceeding the immediate
supply of currency, and Congress will probably be
called upon to reinforce it in some manner. When
business is as rushing as it has been for a year or two.
large amounts of money are required to carry it on,
hence as far as the money market is concerned a
moderate falling off in the volume of trade would not
be unwelcome at the moment. But there arc few signs
of any 'decrease at present. True, the distributive
trade is reported quieter in some sections, and some
States, notably California, Indiana, New Hampshire,
New Jersey and several of the Territories, show
slightly increased liabilities in failures, though, the
country at large shows less failures than at this time
last year, the suspensions being remarkably small, as
repeatedly remarked in this column. The great
staples, however, continue as active as ever, and the
bank clearances at New York, despite the interruptions
caused by the Dewey reception and the yacht race,
are larger than ever before. Thus, in spite of a- tight
money market at the country's financial center, the
business of the nation continues heavier than ever
before known. And the gratifying feature of it is
that it is apparently a genuine business, a legitimate
demand for all sorts of goods. It is a curious condi
tion, to say the least. Generally, when money ad
vances and becomes somewhat scarce trade falls off.
For the rest there is nothing new. Prices for all
commodities continue firm at the recent sharp ad
vances, and mills and factories are turning down
orders all over the country. , The demand for pro->
visions is so sharp in the West that the great packing
houses there are from a week to a fortnight behind
in their orders; and it has been often observed that
when provisions arc active business is brisk all over
the land.
The Mechanics' Institute of this city jis making a
record as a splendid school for librarians. Last week
two of its attaches were given positions in other li
braries. One went to take charge of the Mercantile
and the other of the public library at Alameda.
Even the worm will turn. The Citizens' Republican
party, stung by treacherous ingratitude, has' decided
trwit if Dan Burns wants any more touts he will have
to look to his stables.
THE TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION.
tZ__JOR some time past the merchants of St. Louis,
Chicago and other important points of the
Mississippi Valley have been engaged in an
effort to induce the Interstate Commerce Commission
to so change the existing freight differentials as to
' give to those cities material advantages over the cities
of the Atlantic and the Pacific .coasts. The movement
I urged under the lead of the St. Louis Association has
I now become a menace to the coast jobbers, and it is
; clear that unless something be done to counteract it
j the results may be seriously hurtful to our interests,
I not only in the city but throughout the State.
Under such circumstances it is gratifying to note
that the merchants of San Francisco have organized
to conserve the trade interests of California and the
coast. The Traffic Association which has just been
formed has been brought together and established
mainly for this contest. In fact Charles Holbrook
on taking the chair at the first meeting of the pro
moters of the movement said:
"We are called for the purpose of organizing a
traffic association to combat the proposition of the St.
; Louis Association, which has asked for lower differen
tials to intermediate coast points, and also for graded
rates from the Atlantic Coast to St. Louis and
j Chicago. Its effort is to secure a rate lower than that
enjoyed by San Francisco. If St. Louis can ship ioo
pounds to any interior point cheaper than we can
i ship a carload out here,- it is plain that the San Fran
cisco jobber will have to go out of business."
From the earnestness with which . our merchants
I have entered into the contest, it is evident the time
, when they were content to do business "indifferent to
fate" has gone' by. They are now aroused to the
I necessity of entering into an incessantly active com
| petition for trade and of being ever alert and
j vigorous. That in itself is a good sign of the new
era, and the city and thc State are to be congratulated
I on the change from the old order of things.
The San Francisco Association . will not have to
1 fight the battle alone. Our dispatches of yesterday
| announced that the large commercial houses of Bos
: ton, New York, Philadelphia and of Galveston realize
. the importance of the" issue to them and would on
their side oppose the aggressive pretensions of the St.
! Louis and Chicago boomers. It is reasonable to
assume that the merchants of the Puget Sound cities,
of Portland and of Los Angeles and San Diego will
join also in the contest, for in proportion to their
trade the issue affects them as much as San Fran
cisco.
Thequestion.it must be borne in mind, concerns not
only the jobbing centers but all the country round
j about them. San Francisco is the great market and
depot for all California products and whatever injures
the city will in the end be injurious to every interest
of the State at large. The Traffic Association, there
fore, merits the hearty co-operation of the people
generally in its contest for the commercial interests
of the coast, since it has for its object the welfare of
; all.
The wide distribution of appealing circulars
throughout . the country is authority for the belief
that Major General Miles wants to be President of the
United States. There are probably several other
things that the general wants and can't get.

THE PROBLEM OF THE SOUTH
IN a recent issue of the Atlanta Constitution two col
ums were given to a description of a reception and
a banquet tendered to an honored guest on his
return from Europe: The hall. was filled by a large
gathering, including many of the most distinguished
men and women of the city. The address of wel
come was delivered by Governor Candler, and
speeches were made by the State Commissioner of
Education and other officials. Now the man to whom
all the honor was done is a negro â Booker T. Wash
ington.
â¢ When Southern officials, dependent for office upon
the votes of white men. can take prominent part in
a reception given to a negro, it is clear the worst part
of the race problem in the South is over. There is
no longer an unreasoning antagonism to the black
man, no longer an invincible prejudice against his
work and his worth. Of course the fact that Wash
ington has carefully abstained from politics and has
advised other colored men to do likewise has much
to do with the favor shown by the politicians of the
South, but it would be unjust to attribute all to that
fact. The president of the Tuskegee Institute has
done and is doing a great work not only- for his race
but for his section, and the better class of Southern
whites have not only the intelligence to recognize it
but the honesty to admit it and the justice to com
mend it.
The warmth of the welcome given to the guest of
the evening was equal to any that could be given to
the most eminent educator of the white race. The
Governor said: "I am hereto-day to say I am glad
;to welcome him back to this country ,and to the
. South. We of the South need more such men.
Especially do we need them in Georgia." Colonel
Glenn, the State School Commissioner, said: "I look
upon this great man as the peer of any man of his
day and time. I regard him as being in front of one
of the greatest movements of decades â a movement
i that will produce like good to both races."
Professor Washington began his address by saying:
"The presence of the Governor of the State 'of
. Georgia, the State Commissioner of Education, as
well as other distinguished citizens of the white race,
I who join this large and representative negro audience
on this occasion, is added proof that the noblest mem
bers of the Anglo-Saxon race in the South have a
. deep and abiding interest in' the -progress of the
negro." He then went oh to discuss the race prob
lem, and among other sanguine and encouraging
things said:
"So long as the negro is permitted unmolested 10
secure education, property,' employment and is given
| the protection of the law,' I shall have great faith in
our being able to work out our own destiny. Over
and over again, while in : Europe, I had constantly
impressed upon me the advantage which the negro
has in the South in the opportunity to enter success
! I'll business as compared with poor people' in Europe.
If you ask me for the source and foundation for my
' encouragement over the 'prospects of the race, I
would point you to the negro who is engaged in busi
ness in the South. In all parts of the South 'I have
met the negro carpenter, j truck gardener, the con
tractor, the butcher, the merchant: they speak hope
fully and encouragingly. Everywhere they tell me
j that in business in the South there is practically no
; color line. Two races are to -live in this country to
j gether, and he is an enemy to both who tries to array
I one race against the other." ...-,.-. . . ,
An incident of this kind is more illuminating to
the race problem in the South than all the specula
tions of theorists, or policies of politicians put to
THE SAIN FRANCISCO MONDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1899.
gether. It shows that among the better and the
dominant elements of both races there is a sincere
determination to do justice to one another and to
establish a sure foundation for the welfare of their
States. Booker Washington is educating more than
the pupils who resort to his. institute. The whole
nation is learning something from him, and his
influence to-day is as helpful as that of any man of
which the white, race can boast. 'â¢'.
THE TRANSVAAL SITUATION.
NOTWITHSTANDING the alarming reports of
imminent danger of war in the Transvaal which
come from South Africa, the declarations of
British statesmen on the subject continue reassuring.
It is true that troops and munitions of war are being
rapidly forwarded to the Transvaal frontier, but the
powers on both sides which make for peace are
strong, and unless something sudden and unexpected,
like the sinking of the Maine, should occur to pre
cipitate a conflict, the crisis may yet be passed in
safety.
There is a very strong peace party in Great Britain
and it has been actively at work on a campaign of
education during the last two or three weeks. One
of the most eminent among them, Mr. John Mbrley,
who represents a Scotch constituency in Parliament,
recently addressed his constituents on the issue and
pointed out clearly the folly of the course which the
jingoes are pursuing. Quoting the saying of Dean
Swift, "I have never heard that ten men armed to. the
teeth are not a match for one man in his shirt," he
assumed that in the conflict the British would be
successful, but argued that such success would be
unprofitable at present and dangerous in the future.
Warming to his subject he said: "The British and
the Dutch have got to live together in South Africa.
Fuse them. Do not say to one race, 'You are to be at
the top, and the other shall be at the bottom.' No.
Let there be fusion, not paramountcy. Are you going
to fight them for paramountcy when you know, apart
from its guilt, it can only lead to new burdens and
new responsibilities, and new difficulties? * * *
A war of that kind will not be a war with honor; it
will be a war with deep dishonor, and what a mock
ery will such a war. make of all the professions that
have been made, emphatically and in capital letters,
within- the last few months especially, upon behalf of
peace! What a faree â what a hypocritical farce to
send your important representatives to The Hague
to try whether something cannot be done to introduce
better principles into the relations between states!
What a farce, what an example for this country,
which has hitherto vaunted and boasted â and justly
boasted that it is in the front of great moral, pacific
and progressive causes! What an example for us to
set to the armed camps and the scheming. Chancel
leries of Continental Europe! What a shadow cast
upon the reign of the Queen! Yes, empire they say â
empire. Yes. but we do not want a pirate empire."
In addition to the moral aspects of the controversy
there are material considerations which have for
some time past been strongly affecting the British
mind. It has been estimated that if peace be con
tinued the gold output of the Transvaal mines will in
the coming year amount to about $100,000,000. There
is already felt something like a gold stringency in
Europe, and with the venture of providing a gold
standard of currency for India the British financiers
are not inclined to lightly shut off the bullion they
now have a right to look for from the land of the
Boers.
In addition to the valuable gold export the Trans
vaal has an annual import trade amounting to more
than $100,000,000, and the British have had the lion's
share of it. A war would mean a loss, therefore, to
manufacturers and merchants as well as to gold miners.
All of these items are being taken into account by the
British people and by British statesmen. Joseph
Chamberlain has been posing as an imperialist of the
military type, but by birth and training he is a trades
man. He knows the value of industry and com
merce. It is not likely that he will venture to run
counter to all the interests with which he has been
so long associated. Despite the gathering of the
forces on both sides, the promise of peace is there
lore good. Great Britain would of course like to
dominate the Transvaal, but she is hardly willing to
pay the price.
REVISION OF THE WAR TAX.
LATE reports from Washington confirm those
sent out some time ago to the effect that in
** order to provide a revenue sufficient to meet
the expenses of the Government, Congress will be
urged by the administration to undertake a radical
revision of the war revenue law. It is stated by the
Philadelphia Ledger that among the probabilities of
the revision are that the rigor of the law will be
increased,' defects which have resulted in a serious loss
of revenue will be corrected and new subjects for
internal revenue taxation will be ingeniously sought.
Such a revision as will cure in the existing law the
defects which have resulted in a loss of revenue will
be cordially approved by the people, but they; will
expect something more. Under the law as it stands
there has been practiced wholesale tax shirking by
some of the large corporations of the country, the
most notorious offenders being the express com
panies. It will be expected of Congress that evils of
that kind be remedied as well as those which diminish
the revenues of the Government.
The Call recently obtained from Senator Perkins
and the members of the House of Representatives
from California statements plainly declaring their
purpose to assist in putting an end to the outrageous
extortions which the tax shirkers have so long prac
ticed. It can hardly be doubted that a majority of
the House will stand with them on the issue, for the
wrong done by the express companies has not been
practiced in this State only. From every part of the
Union complaints have been heard and in several
States besides California the people have in many
cases appealed to the courts for redress.
One of the extraordinary features of the tax shirk
ing is that while the courts have uniformly declared
the plain intent of the law to be that the express com
panies shall pay the tax, the corporations ; have gone
on with the shirking as if the decisions of the courts
were worthless. Every day of delay adds' an enor
mous sum to the amount taken from the people by
the companies,- and yet for some reason the courts
seem willing to grant them delay. - . 'â¢ "â 
It will be remembered that when 1 the corporations
wished a prompt decision on the income tax law the
courts provided a way by which- final judgment was
given before the first installment of the tax was due.
Since a similar promptness cannot be obtained in the
present instance to protect the public from- the
rapacity of the corporations. Congressional action be
comes: imperative, and it will be with no little satis
faction the people will note the undertaking of the
revision of the law. â¢â â  .-â >â¢".â¢ * '"â¢..*-â¢ â "â â â¢

exalted position.

recently docked at the Portsmouth dock
yard and is now progressing with a series
of trials, which will take about two
months.
The German cruiser Victoria Lu'.se of
5650 tons, built at Bremen, has passed
through her forced draught trial, develop
ing a speed of 19.1 knots. The contract
call< d for 20 knots.
The British battleship London, built at
the -Portsmouth dock yard, had the keel
laid December 7, IS9S, and was launched
September 21. taking less than nine
months to build and half completing a
15,000-ton ship.
Through the Introduction of modern
guns aboard ships In the German navy
there has been effected a considerable re
duction in the; personnel. The Branden
burg's complement of 575 tun been cut
down to 552; Sachsen from 410 to 375 and
Slegfreid from 255 to 225. ?.;- .
The British cruiser Powerful has left
the China station and is due at Ports
mouth, October 23. Her place . will be
taken by the sister ship Terrible. Both
vessels will pass through the Suez Canal
and their draught, which in seagoing con
dition is 27 feet, will have to be reduced
to 25 feet 7 inches. This will be effected by
taking out all the coal except the neces
sary quantity to steam through the canal.
The annual depreciation of modern war
vessels has been figured by Japanese navy
officials to range as follows on the first
cost: Armored ships, 3.9 per cent; un
armored vessels. 5.4 per cent, and 6.5 per
cent on torpedo craft. According to this
showing an armored ship completed dur
ing the present year would in ten years
hence only represent a value of 61 per cent
of her first cost, an unarmored vessel 46
per cent and a torpedo craft would be
worth only 35 per cent of the original cost.
As, however, it is reasonable --to assume
that the vessels had been kept in good I
repairs during this period at an average j
expenditure of say 2 per cent per annum; i
the alleged depression should be reduced j
correspondingly. As a matter of fact the j
hulls of the two first types are practically j
indestructible if properly cared for; the j j
motive power may also be preserved for i
a great number of years with proper j
treatment, and the only serious and un
preventable depreciation of the' vessels
enumerated is due to. the fact that they
rapidly become obsolete, and â¢ there are
scores of these in the several navies.; ...
A third-class sheathed cruiser, named
Infernet, was launched at Bordeaux Sep
tember 7. She is 2452 tons displacement,
311 feet 8 inches In length. 39 feet 4 inches
breadth and 15 feet 6 inches draught. The
engines, of 8500 horsepower, are to give a
speed of 20*4 knots. Her battery embraces
two six-Inch, four three and a half-Inch,
eight six-pounders and ten one and a half
pounders. The launching, took place with
the engines and boilers' in the ship, and
she] will be rapidly completed. 'Ââ¢''.'â ; ,
The Canopus, British battleship of 12.950
tons, recently completed, passed through
her eight-hour full-power trial on Sep
tember 12. With 289 pounds of steam the
revolutions averaged 10S5, developing 13,763
horsepower and giving a speed by log of
15.5 knots.' The coal consumption was only
1.72 pounds per horsepower per hour. The
designed horsepower was 13,500, which
was exceeded by 263. but the intended
speed of 18.75 knots, fell short by one
fourth of a knot, if the log recorded accu
rately. The ship was down to a draught
of twenty-six feet on an even keel, which
exceeds the draught legend by seven
inches, or about 350 tons extra displace-]
ment.
Great difficulty was experienced in
building the Oriental drydock at Shang
hai. The soil was muddy sand, without
cohesion, and to secure a solid foundation
3500 twelve-inch piles of twenty-four foot
length were driven over the area of the
bottom. These piles were capped longi
tudinally, upon which again transverse
stringers were laid, all of which timber
work was bedded in seven feet of con
crete and floored with three-inch plank.
The keel-blocks are spaced with four-foot
centers, with six piles under each block,
and when recently a vessel of war weigh
ing 7000 tons was docked there was no
sign of sagging or other infirmities of the
structure.
A sheathed cruiser of 6375 tons is to be
built at the new Russian Government
yard at Windau. The vessel is to be 412
feet in length, 53 feet 6 inches beam and
20 feet 8 inches draught. The engines,
with twelve Normand boilers, will devel
op 20.000 horsepower to give a speed of
23 knots. lucre will be three funnels and
two military masts and the armament
will be composed of four S-lnch and two
turrets, twelve 6-inch Canet quick-firers
of 45 calibers, of which eight in casemates
and four on upper deck; twelve 3-inch
50-callber quick-firers in battery and eight
6-pounder Hotchkiss, besides five torpedo
tubes,' of which two are under water. The'
cruiser will have the unusual high free
board of 20 feet 6 inches.

ANNUAL REPORT. ;

Subscribers Are Indignant Because
All Information Regarding the
Plans of the Society Are
Withheld.
There la music in the air. symphony
music at that, and some jarring notes.
Some of the most prominent members of
the Symphony Society are indignant, be
cause they have so far been unable to
obtain a satisfactory statement from the
secretary in regard to the funds and
plans of the society iir this season. They
claim that unless an official session Is
called before the fifteenth of this month
they will call a special meeting and de
mand information as to the standing of
the society. In fact, the date for the spe
cial meeting has been fixed for the
15th of this month and notices to this
effect will be forwarded to the members
unless an official meeting is called by the
directors before that date. ;
The members having regularly sub
scribed to the concerts believe themselves
entitled to inforr anon as to the work of
the society, usually the symphony sea
son commences September 15 or there
abouts, and now almost a month has
past since that date and nothing has been
done. It is asserted that the surplus fund
should amount to about 52.000, and that
this sum is sufficient to reorganize a new
series of concerts. â  â¢ -;
Dr. H. J. Stewart, president of the so
ciety, claims that, on account of the fact
that the musicians have raised their rates
from $5 to J*, it would be financial sui
cide to give a series of concerts this sea
son, and in this contention he seems to
have some â¢ supporters. - Other members
claim, however, that at least an effort
should be made to solicit subscribers and
notify the members to renew their sub
scriptions. Such an effort may turn out
to be so successful that a new series of
concerts would be a possibility. *
Secretary Harold Wheeler claims that
efforts had been made to call a meeting,
but they were in vain, while the members
state again that they have so far not
received any notice. Harry H. Campbell
claims that* he settled with the secretary
at the end of last season and that the
society was in nourishing circumstances.
It would seem, therefore, that the mcm
i bers are corroborated in their claim that
I something should be done to revive mat-
I ters. ' â¢<',-. . â¢â¢ .
Another obstacle that seems to be ad
i vanced by one side is the lack of a
! leader. To this the members present the
i names of three capable gentlemen, Oscar
i "Weil, who has led symphony concerts be
! fore and proved a successful conductor;
Max Hirschfeld. who has proved his effi
ciency on many occasions, and Henry
Holmes, for whom a petition is being cir
culated by many prominent members of
the society. Fpon being asked whether
Hiev were willing to accept the position,
each of these gentlemen declared in the
affirmative. â¢ â¢ "v.
Having sufficient funds and there being
no Jack. of a leader the members do not
see why there should be any more delay
i in the matter, and a number of them
! have therefore decided to take some ac
; tion and agitate a movement to reorgan
ize. Mr. Campbell states that a large
number of the, old subscribers have sent
in their applications for new cards and
are now impatiently waiting for informa
tion. Upon inquiry it was found that
a great many of the subscribers are anx-
I ious to have a new series of concerts, and
j while Fritz Scheel was the most efficient
i man they could have desired for this po
sition they do not see why another capa
; ble musician cannot give San Francisco a
I series of symphony concerts which It
needs and to discontinue which would be
j musical suicide.

Notwithstanding the edict of the

the burning of incense and the carrying

ceremonies. The edict was the subject of
a sermon delivered by Father Ratcliff re

bishop's prohibition of incense entirely
and of the use of candles In processions
would not be accepted in this country,
because they grounded their opinion on
an old act of Parliament, passed in
Queen Elizabeth's time. It is the opin

the decision does not apply to American
churches, as it concerns matters of form
and not of faith. It had not been gener

In his sermon Father Bartlett took for
his text the eleventh verse of the third
chapter of First Corinthians. "For other
foundation can 'no man lay than that is
laid, which Is Jesus Christ." Father Bart
lett proved himself an earnest, forceful
speaker and quite won the hearts of his
congregation -by his quiet buc effective
oratory. He spoke of the foundation of
the spiriitual structure, which is not ma
terial in character but is In each Individ
ual soul.
"St. Paul's great faith In Jesus Christ,"
said Father Bartlett. "prompted him to
utter the words of the text I have chosen.
Jesus Christ has laid the foundation of
his church and priests and Bishops are
merely instruments. It is not Just that
the latter should be regarded as superior
to the cnurch Itself. We often hear peo
ple say, 'I belong to Mr. So and So's
church, or I like Mr. Blank's preaching.'
My impression is that individual teach
ing jor preaching is not the standard, but
the church itself should be given the im
portance It possesses as the temple of
Jesus Christ.
"You that have been baptized should
rear a temple on that foundation of faith
that will be worthy in the sight of God.
We should feel the need of making our
selves fit to stand In his presence on the
last day."
Father Bartlett was born In Buffalo, Is
33 years of age and a graduate of the
Western Theological Seminary of Chi
cago. He resigned as rector of St. Paul,
Long Island, to accept the vacancy made
by Rev. Herbert Parrish, who is now
pastor of the Church of the Advent.
MISS LYONS WORK
AMONG THE ARABS
Miss Mary Lyons, who for eighteen
months past was one of the two workers
in the Peniel Mission at Port Said, Egypt. !
was the guest of the local mission at 49
Third street yesterday afternoon. Miss
Lyons is a Jewess, her grandfather hay- I
ing been chief rabbi of Jerusalem. They '
were both converted to the Christian re- >
ligion at Mount Zion, where the daughter
was born. i
Miss Lyons told of her conversion by
Miss Vansant, one of the Port Said work
ers, who visited Jerusalem during a se- I
vere illness, from which she afterward
died.
"I became interested in the good work,"
said Miss Lyons, "through the kindly
character of Miss Vansant. Her lovable
ways and her implicit faith in the Lord
so impressed me that I joined her at Port
Said and entered the work, to which I am
anxious to return.
"There is much to do in Egypt, especi
ally among the little girl children whom
the Moslems do not regard very highly.
We have established a school which be
gan with twenty pupils, but now numbers
thirty-five little ones, who are learning
the word of God. We go among the poor
people in their wretched mud huts and
experience no difficulty in persuading pa
rents to allow their little daughters to at
tend the school. We have become very
much encouraged in the saving of these
little souls. They are eager to be taught
the lessons in the Bible and several are
able to repeat from memory a number of
verses In the holy book."
To-morrow afternoon there will be an
other meeting and Miss Lyons will wear
the Arab costume which she uses when
working among the natives.
NO DESIRE TO ECONOMIZE.
School Directors Destroy Desks That
Could Have Been Repaired.
The latest School Board scandal prem
ises to give the Directors who are at pres
ent undergoing Grand Jury investigation
a great deal of trouble before the end is
reached. The deal In which the Supplies
Committee la now involved tends to show
that Directors Conlon and Gedge have lit
tle regard for the welfare of the School
Department in the expenditure of the
funds. Their extravagance became so no
torious seme months ago that the board
shut down on them and limited them to
an outlay of $2500 a month. Instead of
obeying instructions they ran up in three
months' time bills amounting to $30,000.
The Weber & Co. claim for $10,000 for
desks was the subject of special consid
eration Friday night by the Finance Com
mittee. Conlon told the committee before
it met that he had only contracted a bill
for $3500, and In tho face of that positive
statement the Arm produced jConlon'a re
quisitions for the amount claimed. The
bill Is for (jesks, and in this connection it
is interesting, according to Director Head
that more tiian 500 desks were destroyed
a short time ago by tho supply depart
ment, which could have been repaired at
little cost had there been the least desire
on the part of Conlon and Gedge to be
economical.
The dismissal of Grant Cole, assistant
storekeeper, followed closely upon the dis
covery of the last scandal and tho an
nouncement of the smashing of the second
band desks. Although Cole's father Is a
member of the board he could not save
hi.* son's official head. Cole says that his
dismissal was in the line of economy, but
he does not like the reference Director
Head made to the unnecessary destruc
tion of desks Just before the ax fell. The
members of the board Insist that Cole's
dismissal had nothing to do with the im
pending scandal.
The Finance Committee has decided not
to allow Weber & Co.'s claim and the firm
will have to fight it out with Conlon and
Gedge, who ordered the goods.

The Offertory Is Set Apart as the
Beginning of the Endowment
Fund. of the
Parish.
Grace Episcopal Church celebrated Its
golden anniversary yesterday with im
pressive and beautiful services. The
imposing structure of brick and stone at
the corner of California and Stockton
streets has become, in the course of
years, one of the landmarks of the city.
Founded in the historic year of 1849, it
has grown from modest beginnings and a
small congregation to its present pros
perity and strength.
Its seating capacity was tested to the
utmost yesterday morning. The congrega
tion of Grace Church has Its full share of
the social leaders and conservative
wealthy families of this city, and
the scene presented at the por
tals of the church after the ser
vices was one that will not be soon
forgotten by those who witnessed it.
Many Episcopal clergymen were present,
among them being Bishop Nichols, Arch-
Deacon Emery, Rev. M. D. Wilson sec
retary of the convention; Rev. Professor
Lincoln of the Church Divinity School;
Rev. Dr. Shaw of St. Luke's and the Rev.
Dr. McClure of Oakland.
The sermon of the Rev. R. C. Foute was
replete with Interest to the congregation,
and was given the closest attention. It
was an historical review of the church's
history, Ailed with many statistics of Its
growth. Dr. Foute closed his address
with a strong and hopeful view of the
future of the church, which has accom
plished so much In the past.
The fiftieth anniversary of the church
was especially marked by the purposes to
which the offertory taken yesterday are
to be devoted. The amount is to be set
apart, and is the beginning of the endow
ment fund of the parish. The church
workers expect to increase this fund
rapidly.
The music, under the supervision of
REV. R. C. FOUTE.
William H. Holt, the organist and di
rector, was rich in spiritual Inspiration
and impressive in its beauty. The volume
of sound in the "Hallelujah" chorus, the
opening anthem, and in the "Te Deum"
and "Jubilate," from the sixteen male
voices of the choir, swelled and vibrated
In sweetest harmony throughout tho lofty
edifice. The offertory rendered was
"Praise Jehovah," by Schubert.
In the evening the regular Sunday
services wore rendered.
THE SABBATH DAY.
Sermon by the Rev. F. B. Cherington
of Plymouth Church.
The Rev. F. B. Cherington preached last
evening at the Plymouth Congregational
Church on the text "Remember the Sab
bath Day to Keep It Holy." In part he
said:
One. of the most priceless gifts of God to men
Is the Sabbath. One day In seven set apart
by the holiest sanction to rest. Left to him
self man never would have devised It. His
own greed and that of his employers would
have prevented it. Even If once given as an
Institution it could not have been preserved
except by the most solmenly binding religious
guards and injunctions. The physical man
needs the regularly recurring rest. The in
tellectual nature needs the opportunity it
affords. The spiritual nature requires the
sacred privileges It brings. Every Interest of
the Individual Is fostered by it, the home life
is strongly strengthened by It, the social and
civil life is broadened and ennobled by it. In
all Its features and all its results It bears
evidence of being a direct gift of an all-loving
and all- wise Heavenly Father to his children.

five sacks containing about 600 pounds of
gold dust and nuggets which he values at
$150,000. Not a bad stake for a first sea
son's venture.
C. D. Lane was one of the first rich men
to reach Cape Nome and he went pre
pared to buy and also to stay. He char
tered a schooner on Puget Sound, loaded
her with lumber and coal and sent her to
Nome. He purchased the Townsend here
and built a small launch called the G<>ss
lin. The Town-end he loaded with sup
plies and the Gosslin he sent north on a
steam schooner.
Everything reached Cape Nome in safe
ty and < * D. Lane's camp near Anvil City
is the finest and best equipped in the dis
trict. His brother-in-law had been on
the ground months before Lane's advent,
and he had staked out a number of rich
claims, Mr. Lane followed suit, and
whenever he saw a valuable location he
secured 11 11 the owner would part with
it at a reasonable figure. Thus, by pur
chase, he secured many valuable claims,
and his grub-staked men secured others.
Lane will be "King of Cape Nome" next
season, as his mines are some of the best
in the district.
"When Lane goes to Cape Nome next
year it will not be in the Townsend. He
will cither purchase or build a steamer
capable of carrying 2000 tons and in it
he will travel to the new El Dorado. He
says the richness of Nome has not yet
been fully realized. Gold is everywhere
and as plentiful in the sands of the ocean
as in the creek beds. It will be a hard
winter for those who remain this year,
as the shelter Is very bad and fuel scarce.
While the Townsend was in Dutch Har
bor the old filibustering steamer Laurada
put in there in distress. She has been
having a very hard time of it, and once
struck on the rocks and came very near
to being wrecked. The crew of the Town
send say the Laurada was overloaded
when she left Puget Sound. Soon aftei
passing out through the straits of Juan
de Fuca her troubles began. Her cap
tain took the inland passage, but that did
not save the overladen vessel. In the
heavy weather she became unwieldy and
finally the captain had to put into a port
of call and discharge some of his cargo.
The stuff was put out on the beach and
a member of the crew left to keep watch
over it.
After discharging the Laurada put to
sea again, but the heavy weather contin
ued, and the captain, finding that she was
still overloaded, put Into Matlaketla.
where he discharged a lot, more of his
cargo. After that the vessel seemed to
be all right, but before she reached
Dutch Harbor she went on a ledge â¢of
rock, and for a time It looked as though
she was doomed. She, however, slid off,
and made the harbor without any more
mishaps. The captain was looking for the
steamer Cleveland, now in the neighbor
hood of Cape Nome and St. Michael, and
if he could charter her he would send her
back after the goods put ashore on the
way up. The season is now about over,
however, and the people on the Town
send do not believe the Cleveland could
get down to Matlaketla and back again
before the Ice closed In.
The old Laurada has been very unfor
tunate. A few years ago she was nearly
wrecked oft St. Michael: last year she
went ashore on the narrows while leav
ing Vancouver, and now she is in trouble
again.
Banquet to Lieutenant Dowdall
A banquet was tendered to Lieutenant
R. Dowdall of the First California last
evening at a downtown resort by the
members of Hesperian Parlor No. 137, N.
S. G. W. R. P. Doolan delivered an ad-
I dress of welcome, and called attention to
I the fact that Lieutenant Dowdall was
I among those that had received commis
! sions during the war for meritorious con
| duct. A beautiful gold badge was pre-
I sented to Lieutenant Dowdall by J. Fenn
; in a well-chosen speech. Charles Ellert
' presided, and a number of toasts were
j proposed by prominent members of the
order.

OFF JAPAN COAST.
Â«
Mail Steamer May Have B-><:n De
layed at Honolulu â Trans
ports Being Chartered. by
â¢ Uncle Sam.
The Mail steamer City of Peking and the
transport Pennsylvania are being anx
iously looked for. The Vanderbllt people
want the Peking to come in, as Alfred
G. Vanderbllt is aboard, and a special
train has been in waiting ever since last
Friday on the Oakland mole to carry
him to New York. The Pennsylvania has
the Washington volunteers aboard, and a
delegation from Seattle, Tacoma and all
the principal Puget Sound ports has been
here nearly a week awaiting a chance to
welcome home the gallant boys from the
northern State. Friday, Saturday and
Sunday nights the Vanderbllt people have
had a tug in waiting to take the young
heir off the steamer as soon as she
dropped anchor, and should she get in to
day he will be rushed over to Oakland
and will go Hying East at express speed.
The naval hospital ship Solace, which
arrived from Yokohama Saturday night,
left one day after, the Peking and two
days after the Pennsylvania. She had
some heavy weather after leaving Yoko
hama, and it may. have been responsible
i lor t:.L delay of the mail steamer and
transport. inuring the nrst we_k of the
run tne Solace nau some very heavy
weather to contend against, She sailed
on {September 20, and tne first day she
only made 131 knots against tne gaie. SnÂ« .
is a good oOu-knot ship, yet all sue could
maKe against the storm lor the succeed
ing nine days was as follows: - 212, 129, !
- -. -..'. 282, 278, 250, 153 and 256 knots.
Thereat ter she made better than 300 knots
a day until port was reached.
'the mail steamer City of Peking left
Yokomaha a day and the transport Penn
sylvaiaa two days ahead of the Solace,
it was blowing hard when the Peking
sailed, and Captain Dunlap of the hospi
tal ship decided to remain in port. The
next day the storm showed no sign of
abating, so. the Solace put to sea. The
chances are that the Peking and Pennsyl
vania both got the same kind of weather
as the Solace and were delayed thereby.
The Peking may also have beeen detained
at Honolulu. She had the America
Maru's passengers and freight to dis
charge there, as well as her own, and
that would mean another twenty-four
hours' delay. Still, she is now out nine
teen days from Yokohama and should
certainly reach port to-day.
The Pennsylvania left Yokohama on
September Id. and it was Captain' Broom
head's Intention to follow the great cir
cle. The Solace only went as far north as
latitude 46 and had fine weather. Upon
the great circle rodte. however, there has I
been some very heavy weather. It will
probably be found that the Pennsylvania
has been hove to on several occasions
during the voyage.
The transport Tartar is now out twen
ty-five days from Hongkong and the New
port thirty-two days from Manila. Both
vessels are a little behind time. The Tar- |
tar is coining here direct, and as an aver- '
age passage from Hongkong via Yoko- !
hama is only twenty-six days she should
certainly be heard from soon. The New
port V} as not been heard from since she
left Manila, and as she may have been
detained at Nagasaki there is no telling
when she will get here.
The British steamer Benmohr, which ;
arrived yesterady from Kobe, Japan, with
3 1 IK) tons of coal, will be fitted out as a >
transport as soon as her cargo is dis- I
charged. She is a fine roomy vessel, about !
the same size as the collier Robert Adam- I
son, and will probably carry about a thou- I
sand troops. Captain Wallace reports
heavy weather off the Japanese -coast and
also a heavy westerly swell a couple of
days before the Benmohr reached port.
The Russian steamer Dalny Vostock :
now on her way from Yokohama to Hon- '
olulu with a cargo of .Japanese contract !
laborers, will come on here to be used as
a transport. She is a good carrier and
should arrive about the end of the month.
The City of Peking, on her arrival, will
also be taken as a transport, and the j
Pennsylvania. Tartar and Newport will
go back as quickly as they can be got I

Schooner Bonanza Returns From a
â Prisoners on the Rev
enue Cutter Sear.
ThÂ© schooner Bonanza arrived yester
day from Point Hope with 17,000 pounds
of whalebone, ten bundles of skins, fifteen
packages of furs and two packages of
ivory. Captain Smith reports leaving
Ponit Hope two days after the whaler
Mary D. Hume. He thinks he would have
beaten the latter down had it not been
for contrary winds. The Bear had two
prisoners, a white man and an Indian, on
board when she spoke the Bonanza. Both
men are accused of murder. The Indian
killed a gold hunter on Kotzebue Sound
for his provisions and the white man an
Indian chief during a quarrel. Both men
will be tried at Sitka.
The crew of the Bonanza had consider
able news of doings in Alaska, but it has
all been exploited by earlier arrivals.
The Pacinc Mail Company's steamer
San Jose arrived from Panama and way
ports yesterday morning and was placed
In quarantine. One of the Chinese pas
sengers was sick and, as yellow jack is
epidemic at Panama, the quarantine offi
cer ordered the vessel to Angel Island.
An examination showed the Mongolian to
be suffering from some simple ailment, so
the vessel was released and went to her
dock. The following cabin passengers
came up on the steamer: Franklin E.
Moore, Dr. R. Zaldwar, Max Rhode and
son, L. Wilhelmson, Robert Porter, Pearo
Tiexido, Jose Tonalla, Bruno E. Webber
and Chris Murkleson. The passengers re
port that lazarettos are being built at
Panama to accomodate the yellow fever
patients and that a strict quarantine is
being enforced on the isthmus.
Chinese Celebration Closes.
The festival of the Ghee Kung Tong
came to Its conclusion at an early hour
this morning. The closing and most im
posing ceremony of burning the josses
that have reigned In a profusion of splen
dor In the house on Spofford alley for a
year was performed at 4 o'clock this
morning, after which the sounds of rev
elry died, away, the cymbals ceased their
clanging and the regalia was stored away
in dry goods boxes to serve in the next
annual least of the family. Thousands of
people passed through Spofford alley last
night, visiting the josshouse and listening
to the weird services. The significance of
the event is the feeding of the needy rela
tives of the Ghee family.

San Francisco 8, Sacramento 2.
Fans hereabouts baked and roasted yes
terday with the sun streaming in their
faces, but they didn't seem to caro as long
as Harvey or Doyle was hit and the boy
at the scoreboard liked up something
for San Francisco. The afternoon game
redeemed the home team for their hyper
bolically bad playing in the morning, and
the occupants of the bleachers and oven
like grand stands at Recreation Park were
satisfied.
JÂ«. â¢â 'â¢ fifth Inning it was rouna neces
sary to remove Harvey from the box and
Doyle was put in his place, it was an
unlucky change. Doyle was hit four
times In this very inning and the fire
works continued until the game was fin
ished. There were all kinds of pyrotech
nics exhibited, the locals tarnishing the
greater eiiare.
'in. first inning brought San Francisco
a ran by a single by Hildebrand; a steal
10 second anu an error by Siulu giving
him the opportunity, to score, in the third
Bruckhoft canterca to first on balls and
by some wild fielding of liildebranci*
snort bit scored. Hiluebrand scored lnVer
on Krug's hit. Pyne added a run to the
local's l:si In the tourth, and In the f'Â»l
lowing tnree others made ths score read 7
to 0. King sj.lit the hall (or a single and
Sullivan aid the same, both men being ad
vanced a step by the sacrifice of Court
ney. Then came Reiily, the swatter, and
he. just did three bags' worth, scoring
Krug and Sullivan. A hit by Muller sent
HciUy homeward.
in the fifth Sacramento worked one man
ever the rubber, Sheehar - itched the
left field with a hot grounder, stole his
second station and scored on Ford's hit.
Hero the Senators rested until the ninth,
when Â£hannhun rounded I le- hug*, earn
ing all the bases. i's no scored a run for
the locals In tins same Inning.
The tjazr.u was .10 interesting one for
the spectators; there being numerous hits
and \> ry few errors. Bah Francisco has
nine ciphers in its error column, while
Sacramento is tabulated with three single
strokes. The fielding of the local nine was
cxceprjpnal; especially that of the three
men in the far territory.

MORNING GAME.
Sacramento 8, San Francisco 5.
The Initial morning game at the Recre
ation grounds between Sacramento and
San Francisco was anything but baseball,
and the score tells nothing of the listless
contest, that was more or lea/ a riot of
errors.
Fireman Fits was touched With streams
of hits in the early part of the game.
When the lire broke out in the hills he
steadied down, for the fear was in his
heart that he might be called upon to put
out the burning brush, as he could not
put out the Statesmen.
Doyle; for the Senators, was not mis
used, although Reiily caught one of his

OAKLAND, Oct. 8.-The Oaklands won
two games from the Santa Cruzans
to-day at Freeman's Park. The Sand
Crabs proved to be a bunch of lobsters.
The heat was intense and both sides ap
peared in had humor.
In the morning game Hutchinson of
Oaklands was the first man up. He hit

ball bounced off to the third baseman,
who threw it to first, putting Hutch out.

home Lange. and Smith. During the fifth
Inning, Devereaux of the lobsters proved
himself so obstreperous over a decision of
Umpire Graves, when the latter had called

tent to the bench and fined. The score
was as follows:

THE SAN -FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1899.
OLYMPICS
WIN AGAIN
ON THE ROAD
Splendid Team Work Secures |
for Them a Magnificent |
Cycling Trophy.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen added
, fresh laurels to their road-racing fame
yesterday; by winning the annual twenty
mile event of the California Associated j
Cycling Clubs, run over the San Leandro j
triangle. 1
Yesterday's event was one of the four
big road races conducted by the associa- j
tion annually, and the trophy contested ]
for is the most valuable one offered, be- !
j ing a magnificent silver cup donated by
I Baker ft Hamilton. Yesterday was the I
j fourth time the race has been run. It j
I was won In 19.% by the Acme Club of
Oakland. In. 1887 the Bay city Wheelmen \
i took it. and last year the Olympics. The j
I cup has to be won three times by ono J
j club to become its personal property, and ;
I thus the Olympics have now obtained a j
j decided advantage.
A novelty in yesterday's race was the .
j Indiscriminate pacemaking allowed by a j
I new rule of the association. It proved as ,
j fair for one club as for the other, but j
i did not result in any broken records. The I
j Olympics' competitors were the Bay City â¢
I Wheelmen of this city and the Garden j
| City Wheelmen of San Jose, the tatter 1
club entering a team for the first time in
the history of the race. The Acmes ot I
1 Oakland did not put in a team this year. I
realizing, probably, that the Olympics'
men were almost unbeatable, a fact which
was predicted in yesterday's Call, and so
It proved. Careful training and splendid
pacing arrangements, added to the speed
of the riders themselves, did the trick,
although the result might have been dif
ferent, or a closer finish resulted, if the
Bay City man on the fourth relay. R. J.
Black, had not been overcome with heat
and fatigue and been obliged to quit when
I '.â¢â¢ race was half run, thus throwing his
team out- entirely.
The Garden Citys made an unexpectedly
good showing for their Brat attempt at
this race. They kept up about even on
the first relay, lost two minutes on the
second, but gained 8 minute in both the
third and fourth bunches. They lost the
race on the last lap by over two minutes,
their rider being unable to hold the Olym
pic man, E. A. Hozio.
Of the Olympians the greatest credit is
due to E. O. Kragness, who was their
first courier away. Me fell three times,
sustaining severe bodily injuries each
time, but came In bruised and bleeding
seven seconds ahead of the next man, ii
Bay City, and twenty-three seconds-ahead
of the Garden Cityite, His ride was truly
marvelous under the circumstances, and
showed wonderful grit and endurance.
Along with Kragness, equal honor Is due
Bozlo, who landed his club 2 minutes
22 3-5 seconds ahead at the finish, and
made the fastest ride of tho day, covering
the twenty miles In 52 minutes. 13 2-5 sec
onds, within two seconds of Kraft's rec
ord for the course, made in 1896. M. G.
Francis, Garden City, was next best In
point of speed, being 44 seconds slower
than Bozio.
The twenty-mile event of the association
is a curious one in its way, as it requires
each man on each team to ride the full
distance. Then the not riding time of the
live men from each club is added togeth
er, and the team riding the fastest In the
aggregate Is declared winner. In such a
sweltering hot day as it was yesterday at
San Leandro it is small wonder that many
of the men came In completely fagged out,
and one, as In Black's case, collapsed be
fore the finish was reached.
The race started at Fitchburg at 10:50
o'clock. Fitchburg is about three miles
this side of San Leandro. Taking the
county road to San Leandro (three miles),
the riders then traverse the famous San
Leandro triangular course (eight and a
half milts around!') twice, making the total
distance twenty miles. One man from
each team, making a group of three
riders, with their respective pacers in the
lead, started at the appointed time and
rode the full distance of twenty miles.
Another bunch followed them five minutes
later, and so on at Intervals of five min
utes until the five groups were away.
The following was the net riding time
of the three teams:
â¢Did not finish.
Fastest time. ISB9, E. A. Boslo, 52:13 2-B Ree.
ord. Charles A. Kraft, 1898, 62:11 2-5. '
Great credit, is. due Chairman, w, L.
Loos of the association racing board for
the excellent manner, in which the event
was managed, and he in turn modestly
blames it on the officials he appointed.
An immense crowd was at the finish, yet
the course was kept clear and the timers'
and judges' scores were accurate to a dot.
The Oylmpie Club entertained the win
ning team in an informal way at the club
house last evening, and -will banquet them
later on. The Bay Citvs, who are good
losers, but who have had a hard run of
luck lately, also held a jolification at their
home. There were dark hints thrown out
that perhaps their bulldog mascot.
"Mike. ' had survived his usefulness, and
some think that nothing but his demise
will shake off the- hoodoo.

TWO STAKES
FOR METALLIC
IN A MONTH
Pasha Kennels' Greyhound
Wins After Desperate Cours
ing at Union Park.
|Metalllc,the best of the greyhounds rep- I
resenting' Pasha kennels in the coursing
field, accounted for. another stake at
Union Coursing Park yesterday. Late In
the afternoon she had a desperate course
with Warship, In which the hare took
the dogs completely around the field. Both
dogs fell from exhaustion after the kill,
and it seemed impossible for Metallic to
recuperate sufficiently to come back
again. In the succeeding round she re
ceived an "accidental" bye, and again
was called upon In a severe course, the
hare being as fast as a bullet.
In the final Metallic met the Eastern
greyhound. Mountain Beauty, that had
been equally unfortunate throughout the
day. Three of her courses were "no goes,"
while the majority of them were long
ones. When wagering commenced on the
final. Mountain Beauty was made favorite
at odds of 5 i" 1. So much money was
offered on Metallic that the odds receded
rapidly to 3 to 1, at which figure most of

promising youngster, by a score of 12 to

SUNDAY AT THE PARK.
Immense Crowds Take Advantage of
the Tropical Weather.
It was a had day for the doctors yester
day. The lame and the halt, rheumatics
and those afflicted with. any old 111, left
their beds by the thousands yesterday
and went forth into the glad sunshine
to get well. It Is estimated by Captain
Thompson of the Park Police that fully
40.000 people passed through the gates of
Golden Gate. Park yesterday. They
covered the walks and avenues from the
Baker-street entrance to the beach, and
down the line of breakers to the county
line.
in all litis crowd there was not a
serious accident reported. It was thought
that the extreme heat would prevent fast i
wheeling, but it seems that the scorcher
will not be put down, except by the
police, and thirteen cyclers were arrested
yesterday for violating the anti-scorch
ing ordinance. Those taken into custody
are 11. Mlcsner. S. Yoshikai, William
Roberts, A. Engwer, P. Altmeyer, F.
Tlckner. William Hoffman. K. Price. C.
Smith, A. Logic. William Moore, F. Gold
berg and R. Miller.
The crowd at the Chutes was also very
large. "Prtncess," the big elephant, was
the attraction of the day, but the giant
Galapagos from the South Sea Islands
also received considerable attention.
Next week Major Illte, the midget, who.
It is said, will marry Chlqulta at the
Paris fair, will entertain the audiences in i
the pavilion.
Following are the results of the
aquatic contests at Sutro Baths:
Fifty yard dash, noviceâ F. Nlel first,
J. O'Brien second.
Fifty yard dash, juvenileâ C. Donovan
first, H. Reebach second.
Fifty yard handicapâ J. O'Brien first,

MEN OF TRADE
TO CONFER ON
CIVIC PROGRESS
Require New Blood
in New Oakland.
Oakland Olfico San Francisco Call.
'.'OS Broadway, Oct. 8.
The Merchants' Exchange has called an
open conference for next Tuesday even
ing to consider "ways and means for se
curing new industries for Oakland." The
idea so often referred to Ii these columns
that one enterprising merchant la worth
to a community a herd of politicians is
:-.ow forcing itself home to those who
have the commercial interests of the city ,
at art. It is now realized more than
ever before that the welfare of Oakland
has been retarded by selfish politicians,
who have not hesitated to use every
means to further their own ambitions. !
This has at last become so notorious that
outside municipalities have noticed it. and i
comparisons have been made which have ''
awakened local merchants. Nearly every- i
thing for the past twenty years has been j
dominated by politics. The letting of a
contract, no matter how small or how 1
large; the efforts to acquire water front
and to determine its ownership; the . na- I
tion of a Postofflce site; all manner of'
publio Improvements; and In fact the
whole business of the municipality, boTn
that which concerns the government It- I
self and also that which controls local
progress, has been handled by politicians
In their own interests.
On Tuesday evening It is expected that i
soma plain truths will be told, and that ',
something more material and productive i
will be accomplished than the passing of j
resolutions. Oakland has been made ridic- i
ulous by resolutions. At the drop of the
hat resolutions can be framed and passed j
regulating; everything from the construe- '.
tion of the Nicaragua canal to the con- j
duct of affairs In the Philippine Islands.
This resolution business has been largely |
the means by which politicians have j
worked and have sought to give an offi- ;
cial significance to actions largely per- :
Bona!. This has not built factories nor j
filled the city with worklngmen and â¢
their families, which are the inly back
bone around which a progressive city cart
be raised.
In a message to the Council forty-five
years ago Mayor pentler said; "There
are, unfortunately, persons in every com
munity not particularly distinguished for
enterprise or attention to their own busi
ness, who are always eager to agitate
and embroil under the hope that out of
the confusion there will come spoils."
If the Merchants' Exchange at the com
ing confert nee compile a list of those
people whs come within the meaning of
Horace Cwrpentier's definition and takes
measures ii suppress them, it will have
found 0r.6 answer to Its question of
"How to provide ways and means for se
curing new industries for Oakland."
A few days ago Gideon Davis decided
that it was time to give the. city a shak
ing up. HÂ« notice- Supervisor Mitchell
walking languidly down the street, think
ing of the possibility of another nomina
tion; he recollected hat since April 1 ex-
Mayor W. R. Thomas had been In Be
clusion; ne remembered that since the
Oakland Exposition Theo. Gler had not
been heard of; and as his mind wandered
over these thoughts Gideon decided that
he would, just fur the fun of it, have all
these people and a great many more
chasing each other and waking up the
town fore many days had passed.
Nor was there any difficulty in devising
the means to set the town jumping. Gid
eon remembered that in the summer of
last year the Montana troops came to
Oakland and amused" Its Citizens by shoot
ing blank cartridges and perspiring for
several hours on a hot Fourth of July on
the Piedmont hills. He took his cue from
this recollection; and forthwith sat down
and wrote an article that stirred up all
the patriotism and sense of gratitude in
the city. lie decided that the Montana
men should have a banquet; not only a
banquet, but should listen to some
speeches and music and be reviewed.
Twenty-four hours later John Mitchell
had the same Idea, and so had
ex-Mayor Thomas and John Brit
ton and Theo. Gier and Fred Sin
clair and many others, who had served
on committees incident to the sham bat
tle. Even this did not satisfy the Intrepid
Davis; he wanted to see his friend Su
perintendent McClymonds at work. So
the schools were aroused, and Mc-
Clymonds had to send around circulars to
principals and teachers instructing them
to marshal their pupils next Saturday to
bombard the visiting troops with fragrant
posies. The Red Cross is at work, and
will attend to the feeding of 2000 volun
teers. The finance committee is kept
busy receiving subscriptions, and on the
appointed day Oakland will be given over
to a military celebration that will be a
credit to the city.
"If only I can Inflict on somebody the
duty of composing an original poem, " Mr.
Davis was heard to say, as he boarded
a Piedmont car, "my satisfaction will be
complete."
The failure to get a quorum at a meet
ing of the committee of the whole last
Wednesday night was an insult to the
constituents of the Councilmen. The ex
cuses given by some members possess far
more significance than Is apparent at first
glance. It shows that there is to be no
compromise between those Councilmen
who dissent from the Mayor's views and
the Mayor. This means that because of
persona] grievances great Improvements
are to be blocked.
Do all the king they will, the fact
cannot be denied that eight votes are nec
essary to override any veto the Mayor
may issue, and any one conversant with
affairs knows that there will never be
eight votes In this Council agalns' my
thing that Mayor Snow may advise. The
only inference is that nothing can be ac
complished under this administration, un
less some common sense bo exhibited in
certain quarters. The merits of Individ
ual propositions do not cut any figure in
the disposition of business. It is all domi
nated by politics. If the Mayor favors It,
it will probably receive six votes; if he
opposes It, It will receive six rotes, for
there can always be found one vacillating
member li eleven.
The meeting bust Wednesday was ailed
for the purpose of discussing tho details
of the bond issue. This subject has been
considered of so much Importance by the
Associated Improvement Clubs 'that they
have given up to It one night for several
weeks part and have arrived at what they
believe to De a practical basis upon which
to call a bond election. These delegates,
intelligently representing every section of
the city, and being presumably entirely
free from politics, may therefore consider
themselves rebuffed by the Council put
ting personal issues before public necessi
ties. The fact that the meeting was called
off because some of the members posi
tively refused to attend It" the Mayor
were to be present, Is no idle guess, for
two Councilmen personally told roe that
:>'ich was a fact. This ridiculous child's
play must cease, or else some of the
Councilmen will bo awakened by the
echoes of Indignation meetings or other
menns which civic bodies a lie to express
their dissatisfaction.
The demand of two of the library trus
tees - .at Mr. Hewlett's book be forbidden '
a place on the helves does not appear to
me to be wise or to be based on Intelli
gent reasons. Th* story is one of marked {
ability, both In conception and In ex- j
pressionl and according to well informed
critics possesses much historical value.
It Js lust .what it professes to be, a tale
from Norman-French life of about live or
six centuries Ago. It Is true that Mr.
Hewlett followed faithfully the environ.
ments that jui rounded the characters and
the period of his story, which according I
to Macauley is the duty of every writer j
who aims to be historically correct. it j
Is not easy to see how the author could
have encircled his story with the environ

SOCIALISTS DISCUSS
"ECONOMIC SUICIDE"
Â© (~\ AKT.ANP, Oct. B.â "Economic Suicide" was the title of a lecture deliver- Â£
X I I ed to-night by Charles E. Fryer, Carnot medalist, intercollegiate debate of â +
? M ÃBB, before an unusually well attended meeting of the Oakland section of 4
.*, the Socialist Laoor party, at Grand Army Hall. It was followed by a lively T
+ discussion. Mr. Fryer, who is a student at the State University, said in part: +
'Â»â¢ "The worklngman or wage-receiver whose only keynote is despairâ .Â§>
-f sees the labor problem in so dark a light that every avenue appears gloomy, â +
â¢â¢> who thinks he feels capital as an iron weight crushing himself and his fel- â¢*>
+ lows to the groundâ such a man may not inappropriately be called an econ- -f
<Â£ omic suicide. He Is the counterpart to the man in actual life who concludes <Â«>
*â¦" that life is not worth living, to whom happiness is but an idle mockery and -f
* death a welcome end. While it is true that every success is balanced by <?>
X failure, every virtue oy a vice, every phase of gladness by a phase of "â¦"
X 'wretchedness, the mistake of the man who holds that life is not worth living â¦
is that he puts his emphasis on the wrong place. The men who have seen life ~*
â¦ most clearly, deeply and truly, have held to happiness, and their answer to _i
X the suicide Is that his view 13 distorted and perverted. Could he but see life X
<Â§. in its wholeness and In its totality, he might find that even though overcome â +
4- by misery he could at least realize some form of happiness by a supreme â¦
<$> effort of the will. X
â¦ In the economic world, the worldof individuals given over to creating y
<â¢> wealth and seeking a share In its distribution, the class of wage-receivers J
â¦ bears a certain relation of dependence upon the wage-payers. But since the -*-
<?> abolition of serfdom and the creation of a labor market, the worklngman has <?>
+ become both politically and economically Independent. His forced labor has +
â¦ changed with free labor at a stipulated rate, for which he himself bargains, X
"â¦" In that perfect freedom to contract for his hire the worklngman finds the <s>
'$ Independence which is his salvation. While as a wage-receiver he may be I
X dependent upon a wage-payer, the dependence is after all, when seen In its ~
X true perspective, an Independent dependence; and this Is really nothing less 4-
X than almost unqualified independence. The answer, then, to the economic sui- >$>
X elde Is, that like his counterpart in every-day life, he places the emphasis in +
X the wrong place. Could he but see the problem of labor and capital in some T
1. rational perspective, he might find that the very fact of dependence, which *,
X seems to throw such a dark cloud over things, might in reality be resolved -â¦â 
+ Into a hopeful Independence, which Is the birthright of political freedom." 4

"It is planned to give a diploma which
shall be a valuable credential, and per
haps In the fututre the apron and cap to
which our servants so sturdily object may
not be a badge Of servitude, but a sign
of honorable labor."
This remark la part of an expression of
the opinion of the leading ladies of Oak
land regarding the foundation of a school
of housekeeping, which it is proposed to
establish in this city. The plaint Is old
that for the last ten years the servant
question needs adjusting. The paragraph
quoted seems to me to suggest not only
the way out of the difficulty but the way
m. If. as is stated, the apron and cap
have been hitherto "a badge of servi
tude," then no other explanation Is neces
sity for the existence of the alleged dif
ficulty. Slaves will never rest easily under
the yoke in this country, and as each year
passes and the standard of education is
raised it naturally follows that the wear
ers of the apron and cap will become less
and less reconciled to servitude, but will
demand that their duties be classed as
"honorable labor," with all the privileges
and appurtenances thereunto belonging.
History as well as every day experience
would seem to prove that the day of the
lackey, who was expected tO bow tO the
floor every time his lord passed, and of
the serving woman, who curtesied to the
lady as she gave her orders for dinner,
passed with the old monarchical ideas,
and that in a democracy dally becoming
more democratic It is both silly and use
less to talk of "badges of servitude." No
precedent can be put forward for the
treatment of servants in modern Ameri
can domestic life, and although "schools
of domestic science" and institutions for
promulgating the ethics of housekeeping
may be very good in their way, it would
seem that the only manner to meet the
"servant's difficulty" is by the exercise of
good American horse sense.
In this connection there are a few other
thoughts that suggest themselves. Ser- |
vants, that is of the "badge of servitude"
kind, cannot be blamed for outgrowing
their conditions of servitude in a country
where nearly every day one of the scions
of the house elopes with one of the lady
employes or where the lady herself runs
Off with the butler or the coachman. Such
examples must be considered in the treat
ment of this question. Although much ef- ,
fort has been made during the past
decade to adjust the servant question. I
have not yet heard of any convention In
which the servants were invited to pre- .
sent their side of the interesting situa
tion.
Americanism is a peculiar thing. It la
responsible for the fact that a canal boy
or a rail splitter may become President, i
An Individual may start out in life by be- I
ing a servant, but it would be a fool who
would prophesy to what height in civil or
Official life such a sen-ant may attain. I
am afraid the servant question will bother
us for some time to come. ;

QUEER TURN IN
MONTGOMERY
DIVORCE SUIT
Husband Decides Not
to Contest.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 8.
The divorce suit brought recently by
Jennie Montgomery against "Jack" Mont
gomery on the ground of extreme cruelty
will be robbed of Its erstwhile promised
sensational features.
The defendant has determined not to
contest the suit and hence his default for
failure to appear or answer the complaint
was entered several days ago and the
case referred to Court Commissioner Bab
cock, who yesterday took the testimony
of Mrs. Montgomery. The wife's attor
neys, Messrs Garrity and Donovan, were
present, but the defendant was not rep
resented.
It had been supposed that Montgomery
would file a cross-complaint setting forth
as onÂ« of his most weighty allegations
the sensational occurrence at his home
one night some months ago, when his
wife, after a scene in a West Oakland res
taurant where she took him by surprise
while he was In the company of another
woman, is alleged to have dashed some
carbolic acid into his face, nearly causing
him to lose his eyesight.. It had also been
expected that Mrs. Montgomery's testi
mony would in Itself prove spicy and sen
sational in view of the cruelty charges,
but this expectation, too, was not real
ized, and according to her own words
given yesterday under oath the husband
on no occasion used any particular vio
lence on her during the six years of their
married life.
Her sole cause for complaint. it appears.
lay In her testimony to the effect that
her erring spouse remained away from
home of nights, not Infrequently basking
In the smiles of other women. It Is ex
pected that Court Commissioner Babeock
will report on the case early this week.
If marriage makes one. of two it must
be a continuation of single blessedness.

the unprecedented figure of 9.1.3 de

"I am at a loss to explain the cause
of this freaky weather. This morning
it was 20 decrees warmer at San Fran
cisco than at Point Reyes, and the
temperature in the valleys was much
cooler than here. I think that wo will
have another day of hot weather at
least. I can attribute this spell to
some peculiar condition in the North
Pacific Ocean, the cause of which can
not now be explained."
There have been several unofficial
reasons given for this extraordinary
warm spell. One is to the effect that a
bunch of Jasper McDonald's rulings
escaped from Native Sons' Hall and
distributed themselves about the city.
South of Market politicians, however,
claim that the molten lava that es
caped from Jim Ncal last Friday night
at tho Democratic Convention has
heated the atmosphere.

CUPID CRUSHED
BY A STUBBORN
ALAMEDA MAMA
End of Roebke-Green
Romance.
ALAMEDA, Oct. B.â The romantic love
affair of Miss Amanda Roebke and Dr.
Jacob S. Green is at an end. Cupid has
been completely overthrown. The odds
against the little god was too great; his
golden darts and his tiny bow were no
weapons to win a victory against tne
stern commands of an angry mamma
and the spirit of a young lady who re
fused to be trifled with.
The Roebke-Green romance furnished
food for the gossips of the Encinal dur
ing all of last February. The engagement
of the young people was announced after
the doctor had passed through the Golden
Gate on his way to Acapulco, where he
went as surgeon on the steamer City of
Panama. No sooner had the news been
published that the medico had wooed and
won the fair brunette than Mrs. J. S.
Green, mother of the prospective groom,
rushed into print and in a most emphatic
manner denied that there was any truth
1- the engagement announcement, and
supplemented her statement with the
threat that if her son was engaged in a
love affair she knew nothing about she
would frustrate his plans just as soon as
he returned from the isthmus.
Cupid held his own during this part of
the controversy, and appearances indi
cated that he would win out at the finish.
Miss Roebke wired to her sweetheart
about the attitude of Mamma Green, and
her affianced wrote in reply that he was
hers till death, and that mamma nor
anybody else could "cut their love In
two."
The end of all this pretty tale Is that
Miss Roebke In a fit of indignation has
hurled her engagement ring into the face
of her affianced, and now it is all off.
Dr. Green returned from the Isthmus a
few days ago. As soon as he reached
town he called upon Miss Roebke. Their
meeting was affectionate, and their pro
testations of everlasting love were re
peated over and over again. Mamma
Green was not consultedâ she . did not
even know that her boy was back. The
happy young couple hired a horse and
buggy and drove about the city just to
let the gossips know that the stories of
their engagement were true.
The climax came the following day.
Dr. Green had visited his mother in the
meantime, and when he called upon Miss
Roebke there was sadness In his face and
sorrow in his voice. Tearfully he in
formed her that their engagement would
have to be called off; he had spoken to
his mother about It, and he was forced
to tell his sweetheart that if - their, wed
ding took place it would break the old
lady's heart.
Miss Roebke wasted no words. She
said that she would not have a man for
a husband who did not have nerve
enough to choose a wife for himself with
out letting his mother interfere. From
her finger she pulled the golden band
that Dr. Green had given her In ex
change for her promise to be his and,
summoning all her strength, threw it In
In his face. She made him pick it up from
the floor, where it had fallen, and then
told him to leave her presence and never
to cross her path again.
The gossips are busy once more and
Cupid is weeping.
Banquet to Soldier Members.

banquet to its members who have recently
; returned from the Philippines on Friday
I evening at Eureka Hall. The hall was ap-
I propriately decorated for the occasion and

His Hip Broken by a Tall.
ALAMEDA. Oct. B.â Boles, an aged
man residing at 412 Taylor avenue, slipped
F26 Illinois street. About 9 o'clock In
the morning he hoarded an electric
car on Third street, but as he refused
to pay his fare the conductor attempt
ed to throw him off.' He clung to the
railing on the dummy and was
dragged along for some distance be
fore he released his hold. Fitzgerald
was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
but his only Injury was an abrasion of
the left knee. His trousers were torn
to pieces, and because the hospital at
taches refused to provide him with an
other pair of trousers he got obstreper
ous, and Steward Allen telephoned for
a policeman. Fitzgerald was arrested
in a saloon near the City Hall, where
he was trying, to get a drink on credit.
Most of the "drunks" who lined up
before Judge Mogan yesterday morn
ing in the City Prison had the excuse
to offer that the hot weather was re
sponsible for their arrest. The Judge
was inclined to be lenient and they
were discharged. One drunk had, ow
ing to the heat, taken off his trousers
and was arrested while staggering
along In abbreviated costume.
while walking up the front stairs to his
residence last evening and fell a consid
erable distance to the walk below. His
left hip was broken and he was otherwise
badly shaken up and bruised by the fall.

During this morning's session $1900 was
raised by subscription for the Pacific
Methodist College, situated at Santa
i Rosa. The money goes to the twentieth
century fund.
GENERAL FUND EXHAUSTED.
ALAMEDA, Oct. Bâ The city general
fund became practically exhausted yester
day, there being but $25 in the fund.
There happened to be a few surplus dol
lars in the electric light fund, and the
general fund was made richer to the
amount of $S0 by drawing on that fund.
The last fiscal year ended in July of
this year, and the city has been running
since that time on an excessive tax rate
apportionment from last year. Salaries,
etc., for September have been paid, but
there now remains but $105 in the general
fund to pay bills that may have been pre
sented since that time.
The Trustees fixed the tax levy for this
year at their last meeting, but as the
taxes do not become delinquent until De
cember it may be nearly two months be
fore the city has sufficient money to pay
all October demands against the general
fund. The salaries of the majority of the
city officials and employes are paid out
of this fund.
Death of Sam S. Harvey.
OAKLAND, Oct. Chief Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Melvin received news to
day of the death of his cousin, Samuel
Slemmons Harvey, which occurred yes
terday at Truckee. Death is attributed to
typhoid fever. Deceased was aged 31
years and was the son of C. D. Harvey,
United States Commissioner of Bankrupt
cy, residing at Loomis, Placer County.
He was employed as a railway engineer
running between Truckee and Wads
worth. Deceased was a former resident
of Oakland and was educated here.
Searched for Remains.
OAKLAND, Oct. B.â A diligent search
has been conducted all day in the ruins
of the hotel which was practically burned
to the ground at Lafayette yesterday,
but the remains of Joseph Cooper, the
proprietor, and his cook, who were sup
posed to have met death In the flames,
have not been discovered.
The belief prevails now that Cooper and
his cook were at San Francisco at the
time of the fire. Nothing has been heard
from either of them.
SORRY THAT HE SPOKE.
Mayor Phelan Apologizes for His
Hasty Reference to Horace
Davis.
At the Democratic convention Friday
night Mayor Phelan, during the course of
his address, referred to Horace Davis, the
Republican nominee, as a traitor to the
city. The Mayor states now that the
| words, while expressing the idea that he
i intended to convey, were more harsh than
j he thought at the moment, and he en
deavors to make amends for his haste in
I the following open letter addressed to Mr.
Davis:
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8, IS?9.
Mr. Horace Davisâ Dear Sir: My impulse
to write you Is so strong that 1 take this
opportunity to say that In making an Im
promptu address Friday night before the
convention I used a wordâ first that
came to my lipsâ which 1 at once regretted;
and while expressive of my idea, it was
too harsh a term to apply to a gentleman
who has always bees courteous to me and
whose character I have always respected.
I would, therefore, modify It anil will now
take public occasion to do so. The Intro
duction of national politics In this cam
paign I hold Is repugnant to the charter,
cue of whose principal purposes is to give
all our citizens, unmoved by mere partisan
bias, an opportunity of passing upon the
conduct of their local affairs and candi
dates.
Therefore separate municipal elections
at considerable cost have been ordered. If
your contention be true, the charter has
erred; but we know that' bad municipal gov
ernment In San Francisco has come largely
from the fact that unfit men have lloated
Into office under party pressure or under
the shadow of greater and more exciting
Issues than local Interests can present. Bui
Concerning the purpose of the charter there
can be no dispute, because it further pro
vides for the appointment of bi-partisan
boards, neither party having the advantage,
end takes the clerkships out of the cate
gory of patronage by Introducing the merit
system of public employment under civil
service rules.
It has been often said, and it is no doubt
true, that In appointing members of hoard*,
as under the charter, there is a greater
danger of making enemies than of hold
ing friends. On the other hand. I am free
to admit that by appointing good boards Ir
respective of party, as provided for, the ap
pointing power may make friends of the
community and thus rrflexlvely benefit the
organization for which he stnnds.
But I am sure as a citizen you would
net deprecate this incentive tO faithful ser
vices. In the home field: nor as a partisan
believe that "ueftlons of currency and tariffs
would be affected by focal success at pure
ly municipal elections. Our people, you
must admit. are certainly intelligent
enough to discriminate between a local plat
form and a national platform, without re
ared to Individuals and will vote accord
ingly when the Issue* are made.
I therefore as a citizen ree-ret that yon
should have made your statement that this
election shall now and here embrace 'he
larger questions of national policy. Itâ¢
you could consistently with the charter
have arrived at that conclusion I do not
know, and If your action was deliberate I
believe you arc wrong.
But you may have been as Impulsive In
deed as I, when by an unhappy expression
I rather rudely characterized your position:
and for which you will please, accept my
mature regrets.
I trust our otherwise friendly relations
may not In any way be prejudiced by what
has been said. Tours truly,

DISEASE FINDS
A NEW VICTIM
AMONG NORSES
Miss Plummer Sent

PAGE, ALSO A NURSE.

Courts-Martial for All at the Camp
of the Isolated Thirty-First.
Freedom Again De
layed.
The smallpox at the Presidio will not
I down. Cases have been developing right
j along, and every time the surgeons
j breathe easier and believe they have seen
the last of the disease it comes up again
lln a new place. The last victim Is Mn>s
Plummer, a nurse at the general hospital,
who was taken down with the smallpox
yesterday.
Miss Plummer was a nurse in ward G.
She has had a great many patients under
her care, and among them have oeen two
who found their way out to the detention
| camp on the hills of the Presidio. She
I was vaccinated twice recently, but in
neither case was it effective. She became
l sick three days ago, and since then she
â  has done no duty, and yesterday morning
; the symptoms became unmistakable.
Miss Plummer was sent out to the de
! tention camp yesterday afternoon. All
i her belongings in the hospital were fu
migated, and those who were in her im
' mediate company have been Isolated and
I vaccinated. Miss Page, another nurse
! from the hospital, who has had the small-
I pox, went out to the detention camp with
i her, but she will not be able to take care
!of her patient without assistance. It is
â¢ therefore thought that another nurse will
i have to go out to-day or to-morrow.
i Luckily Miss Plummer's case is not a seri
ous one, and she is not considered in
' much danger, but the disease is as in
; fectious in its lighter stages as it is when
j it becomes more virulent, so the risk v
I Just as great for all who have to ccme In
i contact with the patient. The other pa
â  teints at the camp, suspects as well as
| sick, are reported to be unchanged in
: their condition. â¢ __ .
It was expected that the luckless Thir
' tv-first regiment would be released from
j quarantine to-day, but it is again a case
iof hope deferred. There are still a couple
I of suspicious cases, and not until they
1 have shown themselves to be harmless
will the command be allowed its freedom.
j This will be about the 14th, that is, unless
i the suspected cases develop into the genu
ine disease. In that event two weeks
i more is the least the regiment may ex-
i Pect.
Even if released from quarantine the
' regiment will not leave the island until the
I transport that will take it to Manila is
1 ready, and then the men will be taken
dlrectlv on board from the camp.
Reports of the recent doings of the
command are hard to get, owing to the
rigid quarantine, so but little more is
â¢ known of the shooting affair and the es
capade of the two officers who sighed for
| companionship. It was reported from the
I office of the adjutant of the regiment yes
i terday, however, that the shooting af
fray was not the result of any feud, but
! just the consequences of a big man going
I after a little man who had a rifle handy.
I It was a private quarrel, and. the little
1 man, seeing a drubbing in sight, called
i his rifle to his aid and punctured his
heavier opponent in the arm and leg. In
anticipation of the expected departure of
the regiment, no time was lost In prepar
ing to heal the breach in outraged mili
tary law, and a general court-martial
was accordingly appointed to meet this
morning. The detail for the court is as
follows:
Major Hunter Liggett, Captain ;
Charles P. Stivers, Captain Paul C.
Galleher, Captain Ellison L. Gilmer,
First Lieutenant Arthur T. Balentine,
First Lieutenant .William M. Meek,
First Lieutenant Perc H. Hawkins,
Second Lieutenant Watson Lindsey,
Second Lieutenant William B. Eulass,
First Lieutenant Willliam H. Monroe,
judge advocate. All are of the Thirty
first regiment.
As the command Is in quarantine none
but officers of the Thirty-first could be
i placed on the court. It is also stated in
i the order that the court is empowered to
try all prisoners who may be brought be
â  fore it, a clause that may be of interest to
! the two lonely officers, for General Shatter
says if there has been any attempt to
' break the quarantine there will be trouble
for the offenders. It is reported, however,
that the two officers were trying to rescue
i a boat in distress, an act of humanity
i to which no blame can attach, and there
was no doubt that after the plug had been
kicked out the boat was in distress, but
whether or not this will offset the pres-
I ence of the boat is a matter for future
1 settlement.
Colonel Jacob B. Rawles. Third Artll
lerv, with the headquarters staff, band
I and Batteries C, E. I and O and one-half
each of A and N, with Troop G of the
; Sixth Cavalry, have been ordered to be In

Â»
DONS GAY ATTIRE FOR. THE
NOTABLE OCCASION.
m
For Fifty Years It Has Been a Land
mark and Many Prominent
Priests Have Occupied Its
Pulpit. *
The closing services of the celebration
attending the commemoration of the
golden jubilee of St. Francis* Roman
Catholic Church, Vallejo street, took
place yesterday afternoon and evening.
The services were the most notable In the
history of the Catholic church in this
cityâ indeed, St. Francis Church is a part
of the city's history.
The celebrant of the jubilee mass was
Rev. J. Valentine of Sausalito; deacon.
Rev. P. Cummings of St. Patrick's; sub
deacon. Rev. Father Augustine of St.
Boniface's Church. The sermon was
preached by Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast
of St. Mary's Cathedral, and the closing
remarks in the evening was made by Rev.
Father Sasia, who spoke of "The Catholic
Church as God's Masterpiece on Earth.'
The members of the Young Men's Cath
olic Union, with Mayor Phelan, attended
in a body. ' ,'- . ' .. '
The music was especially good, the
"Kyrie," "Gloria," "Sanctus" and "Ag
nus Dei" was sung, as well as the
"Credo" and "Benedictus" from Webber,
in B flat ,â¢â¢ â _
The soloists were: Sopranos, Mrs. B. F.
Sides and Miss Agnes Devlin; contraltos.
Miss Valorton, Miss Margaret Brougham
and Mrs. John Sheerin: tenors, Thomas
Walsh, L. Anderson and Mrs. T. Hlllard:
bassos, Messrs. J. C. Woodbridge and
Lane: also a chorus of fifty voices. Miss
Maude Fay sang Wiegand's "O Salu
tarls," with violin obligato by Miss Clo
tilde Devlin. Mrs. A. B. Collins presided
at the organ. â ? : â ,
In the evening at 7:30 o'clock Lejeal 3
solemn vespers were sung, with Miss Ltl
lie Roeder, Miss Walsh, Mrs. A. B. Col
lins, Miss Ella McCloskey, as soprano
soloists, and Messrs. Walsh and Hlllard,
tenor soloists; and J. C. Woodbridge,
basso.
Through the energies of Rev. Father
Caraher, the weather-worn appearance of
the old red brick structure, which has
been a landmark of the city for the past
flftv years, was completely changed. The
outer walls have been given a coating of
plaster of granite shade. The Interior
of the edifice for yesterday's celebration
was a work of art. The decorations were
in gold with a slight relief of pure white.
The altar and organ loft were decorated
with natural flowers in great profusion.
The founders of St. Francis' Church
were Father Magognotte. affectionately
known as "Father Peter." who in course
of time became vicar general, and Father
Blalve. the organizer of the French con
gregation. After him at St. Francis' came
Rev. Eugene O'Connell, who was later
consecrated Bishop of Marysvllle; Fathers
T. Quinn. Timasio, Kenny. Fortnick and
Accolti, S. J., and Maraschl, S. J., who
eventually labored together zealously in
building up St. Ignatius College and
Church on the block of land on which the
Parrott building is now situated. Then
came Fathers King of Oakland,
Macken, Sanchez. Carroll, Florlan and
Thomas Cian, the Chinese priest, who
pursued his ecclesiastical studies in China
and subsequently in Rome. He spent sev
eral years as assistant pastor of St.
Francis' Church. Following were Fathers
Vila, Raho, Auge, Cupln, Cotter, Gabriel,
Serrano, Aerden, O. P.; Vincent Vinljes,

HIS COMMISSION FOUND
AMONG A LOT OF ASHES
Startling Discovery by Major
O'Neil of the First California.
The Document Promoting Second Lieuten
ant Wall, Signed by Governor Gage,
Unearthed in a Barrel Back of
the Occidental Hotel.
THROUGH the blundering methods j
of Governor Gage and Adjutant
General Seamans, and the criminal
act of somebody who Is yet un
identified, William Wall, a brave
officer of the First California Regi
ment has been deprived of his commis
sion as first lieutenant of the regiment.
While ranking as second lieutenant of
the regiment, as he and his fellow
eoldlers thought, Wall should have
.drawn pay as first lieutenant according
' to the commission issued to him by the
Governor, and which was found yester
day hidden in an ash barrel in the Oc
cidental Hotel. The Important discovery
' was made by Major O'Neil of the "Fight
ing First."
The story of the loss of the commission
dates back several months ago. There
was a hot fight on among the friends of
the officers of the regiment to Bee who
would receive recognition at the hands
of the Governor for meritorious service
at Manila.
Wall was strongly indorsed for the
first lieutenancy of the regiment on ac
: count of the bravery he displayed in the
recent unpleasantness with Spain. He
had a strong rival In Arthur Rivers,
who had been accused of cowardice by
Major O'Neil, but who was acquitted of
the charge after an Investigation con
ducted by Colonel Smith. Wall finally
captured the prize, the commission being
duly made out by the chief executive
and sent to Adjutant General Seamans,
â¢who was stopping at the Occidental
Hotel. Rivers was commissioned second
lieutenant, much to the surprise of his
friends, who expected he would outrank
Wall In the fight for the first lieutenancy
of the regiment.
While Wall was being congratulated on
his promotion, word was received that a
mistake had been made and that Rivers
had been promoted to the rank of first
lieutenant and Wall to the second lieu
tenancy. It was claimed at the time that
Wall's commission as first lieutenant
had not been signed by the Governor,
who at the last moment concluded to give
the place to Rivers. Suspecting some
thing wrong Major O'Neil went to
Colonel Duboce and showed him a tele
gram from Secretary of State Curry, In
forming him that Wall had been com
missioned first lieutenant of the regiment.
Duboce told him that a mistake had been
committed and that Rivers would be
recognized as the first lieutenant.
Major O'Neil the following day visited '
the adjutant general in the Ocidental ;
Hotel and demanded an explanation. Sea
mans treated him indifferently, but when
questioned by O'Neil he vociferously de
clared that the Governor had never
thought of promoting Wall to the rank
of first lieutenant Determined to ascer
tain the truth of this assertion, O'Neil
made a quiet investigation with the re- ;
sult that he learned that the commission
making Wall first lieutenant of the reg
iment had not only been signed by the
Governor, but had been forwarded to this
city. He also learned that the document
had not been canceled and that the ene- â .
mies of his friend Wall were making
frantic efforts to get possession of it.
In some manner, which he refused to i
discuss. O'Neil learned that the commis- !
sion was hidden in an ash barrel In the
rear of the Occidental Hotel, and he de- !
termined to get possession of it in the
hope of disproving Seamans" statement.
that the Governor had not signed a com
mission promoting Wall to the rank of
first lieutenant of the California regiment.
On going to the hotel O'Neil took a bell
boy into his confidence and Induced him
to show him the ash barrels. After ex
amining two of them he finally found the
commission secreted under a pile of ashes. :
With many expressions of Joy O'Neil,

placed it in his pocket and left the hotel.
Subsequently he turned It over to Wall,
after advising him to keep it as an evi
dence of treachery on the part of the Gov
ernor and Adjutant General Seamans.
To-day O'Neil intends to Interview the
Governor with a view of finding out why
the commission of Wall had not been
honored and primarily to Induce him to
make an Investigation into the finding of
the document In the ash barrel, and thus
learn the name of the person who so
disposed of it.
When seen yesterday Wall said that
after ho had received his commission as
second lieutenant of the regiment he
learned that the Governor had also signed
another commision promoting him to the
rank of first lieutenant, lie was at a loss

PREFERRED DEATH TO JAIL
George Davis, Serving Time in the

One of the most ghastly sights imagina
ble was presented to the view of Drs. T.
J. Crowley and P. Stephens of the City
and County Hospital yesterday morning
when George Davis, a prisoner from the
BIG FIRE IN THE TREES
NEAR GOLDEN GATE PARK
A FIERCE fire in a forest of gum
trees and underbrush that for a
time baffled the efforts of the
Fire Department and threatened
the destruction of several small
ranch houses, ragod yesterday after
noon In the hills south of the Affili
ated Colleges. A largo area was
burned over before the Are ran Its
course. The fact that there was not a
breath of wind blowing is the only
thing that saved the western part of
the city from serious damage.
About 11 o'clock a little puff of
smoke rose up from a ravine back of
the colleges and curled In a column
straight into the air. It attracted the
attention of residents of the neighbor
hood, who, knowing the Inflammable
character of the underbrush, notified
the men- of engine 26, who responded
promptly to a still alarm.
While the firemen were on their way
to the fire, flames burst from the ra
vine, {riving the surrounding hills the
appearance of a volcano in active
eruption. Tongues of Are leaped into
the air, end a cloud of smoke spread
like a pall over the surrounding
country. An alarm was at once sent

branch County Jail, was dumped on the
operating table from the patrol wagon of
the Seventeenth street station. Davis,
who had been sentenced to six months
for malicious mischief, drew a razor
across his throat at 6 o'clock yesterday
morning. The slash reached from ear to
ear and required fifteen stitches of the
surgeon's needle to draw the cut together.
In his attempt to end his life he by the
barest possible shave drew the razor on
top of the windpipe and Jugular vein, but
did not penetrate deep enough to make
the job a success.
Sheriff Henry Martin's deputies at the
branch jail are very reticent as to how
Davis came to have a razor In his pos
session while locked up In his cell. It was
only a few weeks ago that five of the
prisoners obtained a dose of poison from
the drug store and came near fatally pois
oning themselves. It was through the
timely assistance of Dr. Crowley of the
County Hospital that they were saved.
Davis' case is another example of care
lessness on the part of the deputies In
charge of the branch Jail.
Dr. Woods Preaches.
Rev. Dr. E. A. Woods of the recently
consumed First Baptist Church preached
yesterday morning to his congregation at
the Y. M. C. A. Hall. His sermon was
on the subject "Do You Believe In Fate.""
and as a prelude to It he spoke a few
words on "Why We Honor Dewey." His
address on the great admiral was in brief
as follows:
"We honor Dewey because we find in
him a wonderful combination of noble ele
ments of character. Wise yet modest,
strict yet companionable, daring yet ten
der, religious yet free from cant, there
are In him the genuine elements of no- I
ble character. The man is greater than
his deeds. He has done what you would '
expect such a man to do. Hero worship
is not Ignoble. The American people have !
found a hero and bow down before him i
because they believe in him."
in from box 396, which brought out
engines 21, 2G and 30, and truck 6, in
charge of Assistant Foreman Fernan
dez. His men stretched one line of
4000 feet of hose to the Are, up hill. and
down, through canyons and under
brush. The engines worked in relays
on the line, using back pressure to
force the water up the inclines. Bo
great was the power used that the
hose, although perfectly new, burst
frequently.
The single stream from the long line
of pipe had little effect on the flames,
which swept up the hillsides and down
Into the canyons, clearing away the
underbrush and the trees like a Kan
sas tornado. A second alarm brought
out engines 18, 24, 27 and truck 7, with
Assistant Foreman Waters In charge.
This force ran a line of 6000 feet of
hose and began a fight against the'
flames from the Almshouse side.
When water proved of little avail In
subduing the fire a big force of men
attacked it with wet sacks, shovels
and branches and, as a last resort,
back-firing was attempted. The
flames continued on toward several of
the little farmhouses in thÂ© vicinity of

ACCUSED OF STEALING FOUB
THOUSAND DOLLARS.
â¢
James McFeÂ« Locked Up on Suspi
cion of Being the Man Who
Bobbed Captain Barne
son on Saturday.
The police believe that they have the
thief who stole a sack containing $4000
from the buggy of Captain John Barne
son on Market street last Saturday after
noon. The buggy was in charge of
James Barneson, a brother of the cap
tain. "He had drawn the money from the
bank and was on his way up Market
street, when he stopped to read The
Call's bulletins of the International
yacht race. While he was thus absorbed
the thief crawled Into the back of the
buggy and got away with the coin, which
was in a canvas sack.
Yesterday afternoon Police Officer
Rlordan of the Southern Station learned
that a man answering the description of
the thief was seen to enter a lodging
house at Sixth and Natoma streets.
Rlordan went to the house and closely
questioned the inmates. One of them,
whose name the police refuse to disclose
at the present time, claims that he met
a young man named James McFee as the
latter was walking upstairs of the lodg
ing-house. He had under his coat a sack
which he supposed was filled with coin.
He claims that he noticed the letters .
"U. S." stamped on the . sack. McFee
tried to avoid him, ami slipped into a
room on the second floor. As â¢ McFee
tallied with the description of the thief, [
Riordan lost no time in running him
down. He was found , In a saloon on j
Third street, and was at once taken to I
police headquarters. When questioned j
about the robbery he denied that he had
a hand in it, and declared that he would |
be able to establish his innocence at the |
proper time. Only a few dollars were :
found In his possession. McFee refused
to give nis address, but the police know !
that he was married a short time ago, j
and that he and his wife have been liv
ing In the vicinity of O'Farrell and De
visadero streets.
To-day Mrs. Drake, who saw the thief
get away with the sack of money, will
be taken to police headquarters for the
purpose of Identifying him. Chief Lees
is satisfied that he is the right man.

edly have consumed them had not a
narrow trail around one of the hills
blocked the way. There was not wind
enough to carry the blaze across, and
the fire burned Itself out.
There are various theories as to the
origin of tho blaze. Some argue that
the excessive heat of the day set the
dry leaves and underbrush ablaze.
Tramps make the place their rendez
vous, and it is possible that a spark
from one of their pipes might have
started the flames. The most prob
able solution Is the small boy with the
big shotgun who had been hunting
rabbits through the underbrush. A
piece of wadding from ' a shotgun
likely became Ignited and started the
Are. Shortly before the smoke was
noticed issuing from the canyon where
the fire started a small boy with a
gun was seen by Alfred Clancey of
329 Eureka street running from the
vicinity.
, The firemen suffered greatly from
the heat. During the progress of the

rob dwellings in the vicinity. The

JOE M'AULIFFE'S
BROTHER FRANK
SHOT TO DEATH
Frank Mitchell Fired
the Fatal Shot.
â¦ â
TROUBLE OVER AN ACCOUNT
m
BIG JOE BEFUSED TO PAY AND
A FIGHT ENSUED.
: â
Mitchell Armed Himself and There
Was a Second and a Fatal .
Struggle Says He Shot
in Self-Defense.
A quarrel over a small store account
ended In a shooting affair last night,
which cost Frank McAuliffe his life and
landed the shooter, Frank Mitchell, in
prison.
The affray occurred at the grocery store
and saloon of P. N. Flynn, corner of Ala
bama and Twenty-fourth streets, at 11
p. m. It appears that Mitchell, who keeps
a grocery and saloon on the corner of
Twenty-fourth and Harrison streets, had
a bill against big Joe McAuliffe, the ex
prize-lightet, who is now a deputy in the
County Clerk's office. He met Frank Mo-
Auntie a little after 11 o'clock and under
took to find out when Joe McAuliffe would
pay what he owed. McAuliffe asked how
much it was and was told that it amount
ed to about $10. Some remark made by
McAuliffe angered Mitchell and hot words
followed. Mitchell in an excited frame of
mind hurried away in the direction of his
store.
Bystanders say that Mitchell went away
to procure his pistol and that he returned
In a few minutes and walking up to with
in about ten feet of McAuliffe drew a 44
Smith & Wesson and without saying a
word fired, the bullet piercing McAuliffe
through the heart. The victim, died in
stantly.
Mitchell was detained and taken Into
custody later by Sergeant Blank and Po
liceman Pyron, who removed him to the
Seventeenth street station.
There Is another side to the story which
places Mitchell in a better light and ac
cording to Captain Glllen of the Seven
teenth street station gives the killing the
appearance of self-defense. Mitchell, at
a late hour this morning stated that he
met Frank and Joe McAuliffe on the
street and asked Joe when he was going
to pay the bill he owed him. He called
Joe s attention to the fact that he had a
good Job and was In a position to pay.
McAuliffe, applying an epithet to Mitchell,
said that he owed the bill but would
"never pay it." A scuffle ensued between
the three men and Mitchell went to his
place and returned shortly with the pis
tol. Another row was started, In which
Mitchell got the worst of it. He says he
shot McAuliffe when he was coming to
ward him and about four feet distant.
Mitchell has a badly cut and bruised
lip and chin to substantiate his state
ment and asserts that he was struck
first, was afraid of his life against the
two men and shot in self-defense.
The arresting officers reported that
they had a hard struggle with Joe Mc-
Auliffe after the arrest of Mitchell to
keep him from assaulting Mitchell.
Mitchell Is about 25 years of age. Mc-
Auliffe resided at Twentieth and Hamp
shire streets.
MAN WENT OVERBOARD
FROM THE BERKELEY
J. BENDER RESCUED AFTER A
COLD BATH.
Claims That He Was Jostled From
the Deck, but Police Say He
Took a Deliberate
Plunge.
J. Bender, a laborer residing at 307
Chattanooga s.treet in this city, was near
ly drowned about 6 o'clock last evening,
In the bay. off Goat Island. The fact that
he had some knowledge of swimming,
coupled with the prompt action of em
ployes on the ferry-boat Berkeley, pre
vented the man from covering a slab at
the Morgue.
Bender, with a party of friends, started
yesterday afternoon to make the return
trip across the bay on the ferry-boat
Berkeley. When the vessel neared Goat
Island a cry of "man overboard" went up
and It was found that Bender was strug
gling In the water. How he came to get
there Is still a question. He was under
the Influence of liquor and the police say
that he intentionally Jumped into the bay.
When Bender was brought to the Harbor
Hospital, where the superfluous water
was pumped from him, he made a claim
that some one had accidentally pushed
him overboard.
When Bender struck the water he ex
hibited some skill as a swimmer. Ha
managed, despite his condition, to keep
on the surface. In the meantime the
ferry-boat had been stopped and a boat
put off for the spot where the man's head
was seen boobing In the water. The boat
reached Bender just as he was about to
give up the struggle.

Disarming Chinese.
Officers doing police duty In Chinatown
are taking every precaution to avoid the
bloodshed which is usually attendant
upon the return of the Chinese fisher
men to this city. During .the past few
days hundreds of Chinese have been
stopped in the highways of Chinatown
and searched for weapons. This action is
taken to impress upon the hatchet wield
ers the vigilance of the police and their
determination to suppress any incipient
trouble. 'Â»â¢':Â»-&
As a rule when the hoards of fisher
men return to their winter homes more
or less trouble arises over the settlement
of . claims.

sketch, was presented at the Columbia
Theater last night for the first time in this
city. It is the medium through which Ed

Bertie "Fowler and others display their
talents as entertainers. Eddie Foy, as
Lebeau, a clown, Is the central figure
about which the action of the burlesque
revolves. '
Everything he said and did drew a laugh
from the audience which crowded the the

ceived.
Josie de Witt, as proprietress of a cir
cus, was at once received with favor.
She sang a new waltz song, "Softly
We Go, All on Tip Toe," and "The
Circus Queens." In the last act she ap
-1 peared with her violin and in addition to
a solo she played the chorus of some
j songs she rendered. Miss Bertie Fowler
made a hit in her impersonation of a
j tough girl, her facial gymnastics being in
. themselves an interesting study. The
I Florences, a quartet of men and women,
gymnasts, did some clever leaping and
i tumbling in the second act. The action is
rapid throughout the burlesque, leaving
no dull moments nor hitches.
NANCE O'NEIL.
After a week of rollicking farce comedy,
the California gave Its patrons a legiti
mate classical comedy last night, the plot
of which lies In those good old days when
the tailor presented his bill each month
with as graceful and correct an obeisance
as the baronet was wont to do at court
receptions. Nance O'Neil and her excel
lent company of players know right well
the spirit of the play "Peg Wofflngton,"
and being evenly balanced they succeed
In getting all the quiet humor and intelli
gent wit therefrom which a clever author
has introduced. There is pathos, too,
which does not lack the necessary inter
pretation. Nance O'Neil has the make-up
of a great artist. "While she may lean
more toward legitimate tragedy, her fre
quent dives into the "element comlque"
are not at all unsuccessful. On the con
trary she receives liberal applause for
them. Next to Nance O'Neil, Barton Hill
is entitled to much of the credit for this
smooth performance. Here is an actor
who becomes younger the longer ne lives.
He is still as graceful as ever. The com
pany is far better than that of Frawley.
Miss Jessie Foster, a soprano who is
said to possess an unusually high range,
will give a song recital at Sherman-Clay
Hall to-morrow evening. Miss Foster,
having been very successful' East, should
not fail to attract a large audience of in
terested music lovers.
