AUSTIN, Tex.. July The great !
flood in Central Texas subsided several
feet during the aS twenty-four hours.
In South Texas the water is believed to :
have reached its greatest height,
and will begin to recede within the j
next few hours. The devastation, in
Waller, Washington. Fort Bend,
Grimes and other counties along the ;
lower courses of the Brazos River and i
the Colorado River is much greater j
than indicated by the earlier reports.
The destitution of the people is criti
cal and appeals for aid in the way of
clothing and food#reached here from
several points to-day. The larger
Texas cities are responding generously
to these calls for assistance, and the
necessities asked for will be sent to the
suffering people as soon as transporta
tion facilities can be secured. In the
remote county districts of the bottoms
of the Brazos, where are numer
ous small settlements of from fifty to
a hundred Inhabitants each, these small
clusters of houses were occupied almost
exclusively by negroes, and it is feared
that they were swept away by the flood
and many of them drowned.
Additional authentic reports of cases
of drowning at many points in the in
undated region were received here to
day. The information gives the follow
ing conservative estimate of the num
ber of persons known to have been
drowned: Waller County, 17; Grimes
County, 3; Austin County, 2; Brazos
County, 7; Robertson County, 42; Bell
County, 1, Washington County, 4; Ma
tagorda County, 3; Burleson County, 6;
Fort Bend County, 1, and Brazoria
County, 3. Total loss of lives, 89.
Nearly all of the persons known, to
have been drowned are negroes. In a
number of instances negro families who
were warned of the Impending rise re
fused to desert their cabins and con
tinued to occupy their humble homes
until swept away by the torrent. An
unconfirmed rumor that 125 negroes
had been drowned in Waller County
reached here this evening. It is thought
that the loss of life will exceed the
foregoing estimate when the real situ
ation is revealed after the water shall
have subsided. In all of the towns lo
cated near the flood rescuing parties
have been organized, and every nook
of the flooded region Is being searched
for refugees. At one point in Burleson
County a party of twenty-two people,
composed of four negro families, was
The San Francisco Call.
rescued. They were found In the
branches of trees, where they had been
for two days, without food or shelter.
The children, of whom there were a
large number, were in such feeble con
dition that they may not recover.
A telephone message was received
here this evening from Calvert stating
that the situation in that section is
much improved, and that there has
been great damage to property and
heavy loss of life in that immediate
vicinity. The town itself stood the flood
remarkably well. Many offers of as
sistance have been made to the people
of Calvert, but all have been declined
on the ground that there is greater dis
tress at other points, which should be
relieved. - - - - -
The water has been over the growing
cotton, corn and sugar cane so long
that it is now assured that the loss of
the crop is complete and that it will be
too late ln the season to replant. It will
be several months before the 2000 and
more county road bridges can be re
placed, owing to the fact that the State
Legislature, at its recent session,
passed a law requiring that all county
bridges must be constructed on con
tract and that the bids must be adver
tised for. There is no provision for
such emergency as the present. The
cost of the destroyed bridges ranges
from $500 to $16,000 each.
Communication was established be
tween this city and points in Fort Bend
County this evening and among the
first telegraphic messages was one to
Governor Sayers, as follows:
FT' LSI! EAR. Tex., July 5.â Governor
J. G. Sayers, Austin. Tex.: Thousands of
people are starving. Immediate aid is
wanted. S. M- Quantlebaum has been
appointed to receive and distribute dona
tions. W. L. NESBITT,
Secretary of Committee.
Fort Bend County is one of the rich
est agricultural counties in the State.
It is devoted to sugar cane cultivation.
Plantation buildings, sugar houses and
crops are totally destroyed. The town
of Fulshear 'has about 300 inhabitants.
It is located about fifteen miles from
the main channel of the Brazos River.
The stream covers a wide expanse of
country at that point.
AN APPEAL MADE
FOR GOVERNMENT AID
ST LOUIS, July 5.â special to the !
Republic from Austin, Tex., says: The
] following was received here to-night:
GALVESTON, Tex., July 5.â J. D. !
Sayers. Governor, Austin: My informa- j
tion this afternoon shows appalling con- |
j ditions from Hood, with continued rise i
j and spread of waters until probably 25,000 I
. square miles are under water south of j
Calvert. Relief should be sent Immediate
ly, and I fear on a more extensive scale
than private subscription, no matter how
] generous, can provide. Under the cir
| cumstances 1 deem it expedient to make j
the situation known to the Secretary of
| War and ask that relief boats now in
i Galveston be permitted to ascend the j
rivers, and at a point inaccessible to them
to use their launches and yawl boats, and
at the same time provide tor the distribu
tion of 10,000 rations. If you concur, I
have the honor to suggest
that you wire the Secretary of
; War accordingly Meantime Galves
i ton and doubtless other commit.*
will continue with the work of relief to
the full extent of their means. I await
your action and will join if desired in any
course you take. R. B. HAWLEY.
The following was immediately sent
in reply:
AUSTIN, Tex.. July 5.â R. R. Hawley.
Galveston: I have wired Secretary of War
as suggested. "Will be glad to have your
, co-operation. JOSEPH D. SAVERS.
Subsequently, the following was j
wired:
AUSTIN, Tex.. July The Secretary ,
of War, Washington: Please immediately
, order by wire boats at Galveston to
ascend rivers, using launches and yawls
to. rescue people from the waters which .
are widespread over the lands of the :
lower Brazos. Please also order com
manding officer at San Antonio to place
at my disposal for immediate distribution j
10,000 rations. Will recommend to Legis

The appointment of Major Edwin
Rice, Third United States Infantry, to
be colonel of the Twenty-sixth Infan
try, United States Volunteers, an
nounced to-day, inaugurated the organ
ization of the provisional army author
ized by the last Congress. Colonel Rice
is the first of the ten colonels who will
be appointed within the next few days
to command the ten volunteer regi
ments, which are to be designated ln
orders to be issued from the War De
partment to-morrow respectively, as
the Twenty-sixth, Twenty-seventh,
Twenty-eighth. Twenty-ninth. Thirti-
eth, Thirty-first. Thirty-second, Thirty
third, Thirty-fourth and Thirty-fifth
Regiments of United States Volunteers.
This designation has been agreed up
on in order to maintain the continuity
of the present organization of the in
fantry of the army, which embraces
twenty-five regiments. Two other regi
ments, to be organized in the Philip
pines, will be known as the Thirty
sixth and Thirty-seventh Regiments of
United States Volunteers.
The provisional army as contemplated
by these orders will thus comprise
twelve regiments, and will add 15.663
officers and m^i to the present force
of General Otis. I learn to-day that it
is the intention of General Otis to en
list a number of friendly natives to
complete the two regiments in the Phil
ippines. As previously stated, the com
manding officers of all the new regi
ments will be selected rom the regu
lar army. Among them, ln addition to
Colonel Rice, will be Major James S.
Pettit, First Infantry; Major James M.
Bell, First Cavalry; Major W. M. A.
Kobbe, Third Artillery; Captain J. F.
Bell, Seventh Cavalry.
The two last named officers are now
ln the Philippines, and it is understood
they will command the two regiments
being organized there. With the ex
ception of a brigadier general, who
may be appointed later on, the twelve
colonels to be selected for the twelve
regiments are the highest ranking offi
cers to be appointed ln connection with
the provisional army, and the Presi
dent is giving a great deal of care to
their selection. The one brigadier gen
eralship will, I am told, go to either
Colonel Joseph B. Sanger of the In
spector General's Department of the
regular army, lately brigadier gen
eral of volunteers, or to Colonel Ed
ward B. Williston, Sixth Artillery, who
is now In the Philippines.
Under the law one major general has
been allowed for each 12,000 men and
one brigadier general for each 4000
men. When, the twelve additional reg
iments are fully recruited the total
strength of the army, regular and pro
visional, will be about 83,000 men.
There are now seven major generals
and twenty-three brigadier generals.
Three of the latter are to be mustered
out, leaving twenty brigadiers, or a
sufficient, number to command 80,000.
One extra brigadier general is. to be
appointed for the 3000 men which will
be enlisted above that number.
HOW KANSAS WILL
HONOR THE VOLUNTEERS
TOPEKA, Kans., July s.â The plans for
the reception of General Funston and the
Twentieth Kansas Regiment have been
altered somewhat on account of the de
cision to have the muster-out at San
Francisco instead of Topeka. The fact
also that over 300 sick soldiers of the
Twentieth Kansas are now en route home
while the main body of the regiment is
in the Philippines makes the proposed re
ception more difficult.
The present plans are to have General
Funston and- members of the Twentieth
Kansas become the guests of the State
immediately upon their arrival in San
Francisco. A special train will be ar
ranged for to haul the soldiers to Topeka
without expense to the soldiers. The com
mittee having the matter in charge esti
mates the expense atjf2s,ooo, which is pro
posed to be raised ny popular subscrip
tion. Governor Stanley will in a few days
issue a manifesto urging the people of the
State to contribute for this purpose. The
plans for the reception at Topeka have
not been very definitely decided upon, but
it is safe to say the reception will be quit,
an elaborate affair. It is proposed to
make the reception a feature of the Kan
sas festival, which is held In Topeka every
fall. There will be a "Funston day" and
a "Twentieth Kansas day," with exer
cises appropriate for each. Upon the first
mentioned day General Funston will be
presented with a gold sword costing. $1000,
contributions having already been made
by citizens of the State, :.:â¢.::.

PROPHECY OF A JUDGE IN CHICAGO
WIN THE
RIGHT TO
THE ROAD
No Power in Park Commis
sion to Bar Motor Vehi
cles From Drives.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, July 5.â Judge
Gibbons decided to-day
that the ordinance passed
by the South Park Commission
ers prohibiting the use of auto
mobile vehicles in the boulevards
and parks is void, .and that the
Commissioners have no author-
ity to pass such ordinances. The
court discharged Harry G. Os
born, engineer of the American
Electric Vehicle Company, who
was arrested under the ordinance
several weeks ago and who ap
plied to Judge Gibbons for re
lease on a habeas corpus writ.
The law gives the Park Com
missioners no right of appeal and
automobile men were satisfied
with the decision, so the deliver
ance of Judge Gibbons was ac
cepted to-day as settling the mat
ter finally.
Judge Gibbons said the Park
Commissioners have almost ple-
nary power over the parks, but
have no right to prohibit any ve
hicle used for recreation or pleas
ure so, long as it does not en
danger the safety of the public.
"It has no right," said he, "to
prohibit the automobile by name
any more than the bicycle or the
tricycle or the dogcart, but it has
the right and it is its imperative
duty to prohibit any vehicle,
whether bicycle, horse carriage
or automobile, within the parks
to run at a higher rate of speed
than four or five miles an hour.
"The board has the power to
set aside certain drives or places
where it may prohibit vehicles
from going, or may designate
what part of a boulevard be used
by bicycles, and may prohibit any
enough to produce a war of the greatest j
magnitude. But I see no reason that will ;
require us to join the conflict, if conflict j
there is to be. The only Interest we have ;
in the matter is a trade interest, and our
great epoch-making wars have never had
their origin in anything so sordid."
Senator John T. Morgan of Alabama
writes: _' ..
"Those who lament and decry the con
duct of our Government in dealing with
the Philippines as being violative of our
constitution are too late to accomplish
much else than to echo the pathetic ap
peals of Aguinaldo that we do not de
stroy our Government in order to save
the Filipinos from the fatal power of his
dictatorship. It is not far to go, nor is
the way obscure, to find in the constitu
tion of the United States express power
iriven to Congress to do what was done
in Louisiana and Hawaii, and what our
self-respect compels us to do in the Phil
ippine Islands. The flag we have planted
on the Philippines is consecrated to the
same liberties it shelters on the Capitol at
Washington." -,--,_ _
Ex-Senator George F. Edmunds, argu
ing against expansion, demands that the
Government disclose to the people pre
cisely what took place before the capture
of Manila; and what promises were made
the Filipinos. He asks if Spain had any
thing but a "pretended" sovereignty to
cede, and demands the reason for the sud
den turning of the Filipinos' friendship
Into hostllty. He concludes:
- "First let us know the whole truth of
what has happened, and then perhaps .the
advocates of glory of dominion or trade
of civilization and religion advanced by

there is but one north and south

power to prevent the fortunate
owner of an automobile using
the boulevard for his pleasure.
"The order in question is void

ban of outlawry when as a matter.'
of common observation and sci
entific knowledge there is less
danger in propelling" an automo
bile than there is in driving a

DEATH OF RICHARD STAHL
THE MUSICAL DIRECTOR
For Years the Leader of the TivÂ»H
Orchestra. Before He Became
a Noted Song-Writer.
NEW YORK, July s.â Richard Stahl,
musical director of Daly's Theater, died
suddenly from heart disease to-night at
his home in this city. He became ill while
in Chicago with "The ''Runaway Girl"
company upon the receipt of the news of
Mr. Daly's death and was brought to this
city three weeks ago by members of the
company. His condition improved some
what during the last week. His family
had no fears for his recovery until to
night, when he suffered a relapse and ex
pired at S o'clock.
Mr. Stahl was for many years the musi
cal director at Hoyt's, now the Madison
square Theater, and he wrote the music
for Charles Hoyt's farce comedies.
About a year ago he went to Koster &
Bials, where he remained until this spring,
when he was engaged by Austin Daly to
conduct "The Runaway Girl." He accom
panied the piece when it went on the
tour.
As a composer Mr. Stahl's work was
chiefly confined to song writing. His most
pretentious work was the opera "Said
Pasha," which was highly successful. Ho
wrote "The Sea King." He was for years
leader of the Tivoli Orchestra in San
Francisco.2
LOCKED IN WITH
AN INSANE MAN
Reddiog Physician Spends Five
Hours of the Fourti) in a
Padded Cell.
REDDING, July 5.- John E. Stall, a brewery employe laboring un
der the hallucination that a fellow workman had killed him. was placed
in the calaboose and subsequently removed to the insane ward of the
County Jail.
At twenty minutes to 12 o'clock on the Fourth of July, Dr. F. Sta
bel was admitted to the patient's cell. He intended to stay but twenty
minutes, then take luncheon and see the sights of the celebration down
town.
"When the doctor emerged from the insane ward it was 4:30 o'clock.
The jailer had locked him in and forgotten him. Sheriff Behrens was a
very busy man yesterday. He was a member of the celebration com
mittee, and besides was grand marshal of th*- parade. Dr. Stabel's re
peated' rails and hammerings were of no more effect than the rriutter-
Ings of his companion, whose reason had temporarily fled. The Court
house was deserted.
At 4:30 o'clock the prisoners are fed, and at that hour the unfortu
nate physician was liberated.
Of the merry forty who were to dine together, the doctor was the
only missing member. Whither he had gone no one knew, and his con
tinued absence created some alarm.
There was a brilliant display of pyrotechnics when the insane cell
was unlocked and the wrathful prisoner allowed to step forth a free
man after five hours' confinement. .

CHINESE PIRATES LOOT
A BRITISH STEAMER
Escape With Booty Valued at $7000,
but Later Get Into an Eng
lish Prison.
Pi rates on the West River boarded the
British steamer Wa On and secured booty
valued at $7000.
I The pirates sailed -on the Wa On from
Canton as passengers. Many of the other
travelers by the boat were women, who
had considerable money with them. .When
the Wa On reached the .Kumchuck rapids
a signal was given and the pirates
.warmed all over the boat. They were
all armed and resistance would have been
useless. One party took possession of the
main deck and the other of the upper
deck, and the captain was ordered to steer
in the direction of Kongmoon. On arriv
ing there the pirates found some of their
confederates awaiting them with a couple
of lighters and sampans," . The sampans
set out for the launch and the pirates got
into them and made off, having previously
told the captain he could go. The captain
made his way hack to Canton and report
ed the matter to the British authorities.
The gunboat Sandpiper was sent out,
and on arriving at the village where the
pirates landed the taotai was communi
cated with and given two hours to turn
over the robbers or the village would be
shelled. Before the expiration of the two
hours six men were put aboard the Sand
piper and were taken to Canton.
SUICIDE OF A MISSIONARY.

HUNDREDS OF NEGROES
THREATENED BY FLOODS
Continued from Flirt Page.
been lost and the number may be much
larger. The property loss will reach so
far into the millions as to make the
Calvert . flood appear insignificant by
comparison.
To-night Deputy Sheriff Swearlngen
made this statement to the Republic
correspondent over the long-distance
telephone from Sealey:
"I am so dumfounded by the extent
of the disaster that I hardly know how
to talk about it. Fully twenty lives
were lost within a radius of twenty
five miles of Sealey last night, and to
day nearly 100 have been drowned in
the vicinity of what is locally known
as 'The Mound.'
"This is a small piece of high land
three mile- from Sealey, near Old San
Felipe. At first, when the flood rushed
down upon the negroes' cabins in the
bottoms of the Brazos three days ago,
thÂ» alarmed population ran for this
piece of high land for safety, driving
their livestock with them.
"The rush of the waters was so sud
den that they could not get to Sealey or
San Felipe. Gradually the water rose
and encroached upon their place of
refuge until to-night not more than half
an acre of the ground is out of water,
' and that not more than one foot above
the raging torrent surrounding it for
miles. On this half acre mound are
huddled together to-night a raving,
surging, gesticulating, screaming and
praying assemblage of 300 negroes,
death staring them in the face in vari
ous forms.
"Drowning seems certain, but star
vation, exposure and exhaustion also
are doing fatal work. Crowded in
among these poor humans are cattle,
horses, hogs; mules and other domestic
animals, as frantic and uncontrollable
as the poor negroes. There is not a
cabin or other bit of shelter not so
much as a tree â on 'The Mound.' There
is not a mouthful of food to eat, clean
wat.r to drink or a spot where the
tired and weak and sick can rest.
"The nearest point of land is more
than three miles away, and no human
being can live in the raging torrents
who would try' to reach it. Many have
been drowned making the attempt.
"The wild, rushing waters are filled
with all kinds of floating bodies of
stock, outbuildings, fences, logs, trees,
lumber, farm implements, furniture,
merchandise and other material. Cling
ing to many of these objects are ne
groes doomed to almost certain death.
"I have given you the situation as it
exists in and about Sealey; it is equally
had at and around Brookshire, but I
can give no details, as we are cut off.
I know there are at least 400 negroes on
a small island three or four miles from
Brookshire in a condition similar to
that on 'The Mound.'
"From present indications the loss of
life is likely to reach 500, unless relief
comes promptly."
CONVICTS FEIGN INSANITY
Sack Release From Solitary Confine-
ment at San Quentin.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, July 5.â
For several days sensational reports
have been in circulation regarding the
behavior of the seven convicts recently
placed in the incorrigible cells. This
evening the rumors crystallized Into
definite statements from an authorita
tive source that Convict Jacob Oppen
heimer is trying the insanity dodge to
secure his release. This morning he
attempted to butt his brains out against
the Bides of his celL
"Sir" Harry Westwood Cooper has
given way to fits of despondency and
weeping and to-day sent a letter to
Warden Aguirre with the request that
he be given a Bible.
As soon as the guards on duty ob
served Oppenhelmer's attempt, or pre
tended attempt, at suicide, the warden
was notified, and hastily repairing to
th.- murderous prisoner's cell told him
that if he did not desist he would be
placed in a straight -Jacket and kept
there for a month. This threat had the
desired effect and Oppenheimer has
since remained quiet.
Cooper was not given a Bible, as the
rule under which convicts are confined
in the incorrigible cells permits them
neither to converse with those in the
adjoining apartments nor to have any
reading matter. i .

â Â» â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ONE of the most interesting Fourth of
July celebrations in the State was that
held at the little hamlet of Cozzens. ln
j Sonoma County. There was a large con
j course of people gathered from the vicin
i ity to witness the main feature of the
: celebration, which was the raising of a
] flagpole from the top of the only sugar
i pine in Sonoma County. The tree itself is
; 175 feet in height, while the pole from
j which Old Glory waves its folds Is twen

'â¢WHAT WOULD JESUS DO?"
! IS THEIR PARTY PLATFORM
United Christians of America Will
Name a National Ticket for
the Campaign.
DES MOINES, lowa. July s.â The
United Christian Party of America, a
national political organization, was
convened here to-day. It will nomi
nate a full national ticket and make a
Presidential campaign in 1900 on a
platform of four words: "What would
Jesus do?"
"We can't go far wrong if we follow
that motto," said Chairman W. C.
Pidgeon of Richland to-day. "But a
somewhat more elaborate platform was
adopted as regards details. Direct
legislation, by the initiative and refer
endum, with an imperative mandate is
the method by which the party hopes
to reform the Government. The plat- j
form holds that governments derive j
their just powers from God through
Christ, and by consent of the governed.
A union of all Christians is asked, re
gardless of nationality, color, creed,
sect or previous politics."
A telegram was received by the con
vention to-day from the National Re
form Party, in session at Pittsburg,
asking the United Christian Party to
unite forces with it. Chairman Pidgeon
was instructed to carry on negotiations
looking to such amalgamation.
As a committee to organize the party
in other States the following were ap
pointed: W. R. Benkert of Davenport,
C. Z. Lindley of Hedrick and J. F. Jen
sen of Dorchester, Wis. A national
convention will be called to meet in
Chicago or Indianapolis this fall. The
prospects are that the convention will j
meet that of the National Reform i
Party in Chicago on December 28.

TRYING MOMENT
In Madrid When the Entire Popula
tion Was Terribly Excited.
A Sunday or two ago Madrid was con
vulsed with a question which outweighed
nil others. In the theater, in the cafes
and in the streets, there was but one sub
ject of conversation, and that was not
the cession of Cuba or the rebellion In
the Philippines, but a matter which
touched the Madrldenos nearer home, in
i the Calle-de-Sevilla especially on that
Sunday was news awaited with anxiety
! from the meeting which was being Held
;at the Hotel Anglais. At last, about JO
i o'clock in the evening, a man rushed into
; the street, gasping for breath, and only
i justable to utter the words, "He will cut
iit off'" The tension was relaxed, there
I was a general feeling of relief and the
glad news was passed fro.m mouth to
I mouth. "He will cut It off!"
In such times of political crisis the
stranger might have been pardoned if
I he imagined that it was somebody's head
i which was to be. cut off. but as a matter
i of fact he would have been too sweeping
I in his ideas. â¢ The man in question was
j M. Felix Robert, a Frenchman, who pro
' posed to appear before the public at Ma
! drid as a toreador. So far so good; but in
the course of a banquet at Madrid he had
'â  announced that he thought of appearing
i in the ring In a manner not consistent
j with tradition. Hence all the heated ar
i guments which convulsed the City and de-
I prived it of appetite and sleep. The meet
ing at the Hotel Anglais brought about
a happy solution. M. Felix Robert, after
a long debate, decided to-cut off hi" mus
tache before appearing in the bull ring.
Tradition was kept unimpaired, and that
night Madrid went tranquil and contented
to bed.â London Correspondent New York

REMOVES AN OBSTRUCTION IN
WHITE RIVER.
Take Advantage of the Absence of an
Armed Guard. Who Had Gone
to a Fourth of July
Celebration. ,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, July s.â Fifty cases of dy
namite were exploded at noon yester
day in the bed of White River, on
Muckle Shoot reservation, where Stuck
River is formed. The concussion cre
ated a scene of havoc seen only where
a powder mill blows up or some awful
cyclone wrecks the country. The noise
could be heard twenty miles, and the
shock rocked farmers' houses far up
the valley, while trees were blown
down and tons of rocks thrown high into
the air, scattering down over a large
section inhabited only by wild animals.
As a result of the explosion the dam |
was washed out of White River and j
the water of that turbulent stream Is
seeking its natural outlet Instead of j
spreading over once valuable hop fields i
and meadow lands of Stuck Valley and
causing desolation and ruin to the once j
famous Stuck Valley farms.
That the battle goes not always to i
the strong White River farmers now !
realize. Two years ago they put a ;
charge of dynamite in the bluff at this
point and let 10,000 tons of gravel and
hardpan down Into the stream, almost
blocking it, and turning the main
stream into the Stuck, which was ;
transformed from a quiet creek to a
vast flood stream, bringing ruin, upon j
thousands of acres of fertile farms.
The matter was taken up by farmers
and by the County Commissioners, and
finally an Inspector from Washington
was sent out. ,He reported in favor of
the removal of the dam and the res
toration of the stream to its natural
channel, but the White River farmers
of King County, who outnumbered the
Stuck Valley farmers of Pierce County
three to one and had 40,000 acres of
land at stake against 6000 in Stuck Val
ley, took the case up and finally had it
dropped so far as the Government was
concerned.
This meant that the Stuck Valley
men must fold their hands and see
their farms laid waste or take the af
fair into their own hands. Several at
tempts were made to reconnoiter the
dam, but an armed guard was kept
posted on the bluff and no opportunity
was left for retaliation.
Their opportunity came yesterday,
when the guard was off duty attend
ing the Fourth of July celebration. Two
tons of dynamite previously procured
were hastily taken to the dam and
placed into position. At noon it was
fired with the result stated.
The Stuck Valley farmers to-day be
began reclaiming their farms, which
have been overflowed for two years.

there. It is also reported that the Coney

'of $15,000. Fitzsimmons said to-day;
"I am rapidly getting into shape and

FAUST WITH
A HANDICAP
Ashton Stevens Dis
cusses the Unpleasant
and Pleasant Qualities
of a Performance by
tr)e Lan)bardis, Who,
by tfye Way, Are Going
to Move Agair).
cp*==s)EW peopl-; seem to know it,
p*-*-""-! but the Lambardls are still
singing at the Alhambra. No
_\ amount of Indifference on the
part of a music-loving public
seems to phase this industrious little
band of Italians. A small crowd of
their countrymen gathers in the gal
lery every night, a handful of regular
opera goers is scattered among the
seats downstairs, and the show goes
on. Every little while this restless but
persistent organization tires of the Al
hambra and moves down to the Cali
fornia, or it tires of the California and
moves up to the Alhambra. It's the
California's turn now and I am cred
itably informed that on next Monday
night Lambardl will pack up his scen
ery and effects and warblers and go
back to Bush street. How'd you like
to be the expressman?
They sang "Faust" last night with
some of the same goods and bads that
have been noticed in the earlier pro
ductions. The principals were fairly
satisfactory'; the chorus was as un
beautiful as ever, but in surer vocal
trim; the orchestra surpassed its worst
previous record â it was simply obscene.
For the first time I was conscious of
the fact that one musician in this -band
Is worse than his fellows. He plays the
first violin, and it is not for me to say
that Russo should have his life l only
suggest. This fiddler is to all musical
purposes tone-deaf. With satanic in
genlousness he succeeds in going
through the whole score about one
quarter of a tone beyond pitch. The
other bandsmen play out of tune with
bewildering recklessness, but this fel
low on the first violin seems to have a
system. He did things to Russo's "Salve
dimora" that no apology can wipe out.
While I am on the subject of the or
chestra, I would like to attract the at
tention of its director, the Cavalier Ugo
Barducco. By careful observation I
have discovered that the good Cavalier
does not lead at all, but Is led by his
musicians. With his right hand he
feebly wobbles a baton, with his left
he thumps chords on a dinky upright
pianoforte. It takes a pretty good
musical juggler to do these two things
at once, and I would suggest to the
Cavalier in the interest of your ears and
mine that he cut his left-hand piano
pounding. A perpetual piano in an or
chestra is a cheap effect at best.
This is not meant to be spiteful; _
had an excellent dinner, thank you, and
went to the Alhambra yearning to be
entertained and uplifted, but that or
chestra murdered the night. But for it
Travagllni would have been a remark
able Mephisto, Sostegni a fair Marguer
ite and Russo a good enough Faust.
One of the tests of Gounod's greatness
in this opera is that you can sit and
take it from ordinary singers. But
Travaglini's Mephisto was in no sense
ordinary, it was a big conception, full
of lithe Insinuation, acid humor and
arch subtleties. Vocally, too, it was
splendid; only once or twice in some
thing like a hundred performances of
"Faust" have I heard the drinking
song sung better. Sostegni's voice is a
bit feather-weight for the more dra
matic moments of Marguerite, but she
brings to the part a quality of ingenu
ousness that is very pat. Her "King of
Thule" legend I enjoyed Immensely,
principally because she sang it as it
should be sung, with the half voice, in
an abstracted sort of way; in fact, she
mused it, and* the effect was fine. The
jewel song, too, was well done, If in
deed nothing to speak of in point of
tone; but" the delight, the frank vanity
were brought out with a glrlishness
that you seldom find in the great vet
erans. Russo's Doctor Faustus was
hardly as tall as his fair victim, but
whatever was lacking in length was
made up in pride and erectness. A
very perky little Faust was Russo's.
His falsetto in the "Salve dimora"
wafted me unpleasant souvenirs of fe
male Impersonators, and I could not
fancy the way he took the legitimate
high notes between the teeth and wor
ried .them as a terrier does a rat, but
on the whole he served well.

morning at the. rate of forty miles an
hour, when the postal car jumped the
track and was followed by the baggage
car, the first-class day coach, the com
bination smoker, the second-class car
and three tourist cars. They bumped
along over the ties, smashing them Into
splinters for quite a distance. Then the
postal car, the baggage car and four
tourist cars tipped over on one side,
while the first and second-class coaches
remained upright in the sagebrush,
about forty feet from the track, and the
Pullman at the end of the train stood
with its front trucks off the rails. The
train was made up of the engine, a fruit
car, the postal car, a first-class coach,
a second-class coach, four tourist cars
and a Pullman.
That no one was killed is considered
! nothing short of a miracle. There
! .were quite a number of passengers â
I people returning to their homes from
< Fourth of July celebrations at different
points on the road. Mrs. C. Clawson
of Grass Valley and Mrs. M. S. An
drews of Coloma, both old ladies, were
the most seriously injured, but not fa
tally, sustaining severe scalp wounds.
Doctors left here immediately for the
scene of the . accident and wrecking
trains were telegraphed for. The
train's crew and passengers assisted
imprisoned passengers out of the over-
I turned cars and everything possible
was done to make all comfortable, es
j pecially the women and the elderly
I men, who were greatly undone by the
shock. Four hoboes were on the rear
trucks of the postal car and escaped
| without a scratch. Two Indians were
I riding in the head vestibule of the bag
gage car and escaped unhurt.
The passengers spent the day here,
the injured receiving medical attention,
and most of them left to-night on No.
3 eastbound for their respective desti
i nations. All the Injured are doing nice
ly. Mrs. Clawson, who received the se
verest injuries, will be taken to the
railroad hospital at Ogden for treat
.ment, and Mrs. M. S. Andrews will re
turn to her home at Coloma. The track
I was cleared late this afternoon and all
j trains are now moving.
DIES OF EXCITEMENT
DURING A CONFLAGRATION
Alarm for a Fire at Wild wood Glen
Sounds the Death Knell of a
Citizen.
SAUSALITO, July "Wild wood Glen,
the noted picnic and pleasure resort,
was totally destroyed by fire at 1
o'clock this morning. The bells that
rang the alarm sounded the death knell
of Granville W. Stewart, who perished
of heart failure during a moment of
excitement.
The flames were seen by Night
Watchman Trouette and Manuel Bet
tencourt at the same time, and both
ran to alarm the community by ringing
the church bells. The fire department
responded without loss of time, but the
distance to the scene and the scarcity
of water caused its presence to be un
availing and the large dancing pavilion,
the dining hall and all the outbuildings
were burned to the ground. The lose
will approximate $2500, insurance $1000.
Whether the fire owed Its origin to
the careless use of firecrackers or to an
incendiary is a moot question. Edward
Stahl, the proprietor of the resort, was
in San Francisco at the time the fire
occurred and did not learn of his loss
until he reached town to-day. *
When the alarm was sounded Gran
ville Washington Stewart, a member of
the Pacific Pine Lumber Company of
San Francisco and secretary of the
Sausalito Arbor Society, rushed to the
window of his dwelling, and, after gaz
ing for a minute at the flames, sank to
the floor. He was placed in bed by his
wife, who managed to get Dr. Mayes to
the house only a few minutes before
Stewart breathed his last. . â¢
Death was due to heart failure. Mr.
Stewart having suffered from heart j
disease for years. He was 47 years of |
age, and was a native of Racine. Wis.
While the water supply of Sausalito
is always poor in summer, its extreme â 
scarcity on this occasion was due to the \
act of a vandal, who broke the lock of j
the door leading Into the tunnel of the
Sausalito Land and Ferry Company j
yesterday and drilled holes in the !
mains. All the water In the reservol*r
was exhausted In this manner, which
leads many to believe that the fire was |
the work of an incendiary. This opin
ion is strengthened by the fact that
a week ago Stahl's watch dog was pois
oned. The water company will offer a \
reward for the detection of the mis
creant, but so far ne clew to his iden
tity has been discovered.

Formation and the Progress of
the Funnel-Shaped
Cloud.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AINSWORTH, Neb., July 5.â
cyclone which seemed to have formed
fifteen miles northwest of this city
passed within two miles of Ainsworth
this afternoon, killing Mrs. William
1 Lockmiller, wife of a well-known farm
er, and doing great damage to prop
' erty. Houses, barns, fences and bridges
\ were demolished and many families are
.homeless. */"â 
The progress of the funnel-shaped
cloud was easily observed from this
1 city It was first noticed at about 4
o'clock, when it was apparently headed
' directly for Ainsworth. The cloud
swerved, however, the storm center
j passing well to the north.
The cyclone's first destructive work
was on the farm of John Strohm, four
miles northwest of Ainsworth, where
the house and outbuildings were leveled
ito the ground. Fortunately, the family
i escaped to a cave and none were In-
I jured.
The place of William Lockmiller was
next visited. Mrs. Lockmiller had
sought refuge in the cellar, with her
'â  three small children. Her eldest son
did not recognize the danger and re-
I mained in the barn. The woman started
I to call him and had just left her shelter
! when the cyclone struck the house. Tha
building was torn from its foundations
j and the unfortunate woman was
\ crushed in the falling timbers. The chil
i dren were unharmed.
At the farm of Rev. T. W. Delong the
cloud descended upon the house, barns
' and outbuildings, sweeping them in a
I confused mass along the prairie. The
family took refuge in the cellar and no
j one was hurt.
; The farm buildings of Charles Trotter
and W. H. Hurring, about one mile
; apart, were utterly destroyed, portions
, of the structures baing carried by the
I wind for long distances, and, in several
j instances, timbers were driven deep
i into the ground..
COEDUCATION IN GERMANY.
Protest by University Students, and
Counter-Declaration by Faculty.
According to the British Medical Jour
nal clinical students of Halle University
have publicly protested against the admis
sion of women to the medical curriculum.
In a paper fixed on the university black
board they hotly oppose, not the study of
medicine by women, but the attendance of
women at clinical courses in common with
male students. They appeal to the clinical
students of Germany, who, they say,
either know by experience or can fully
imagine the awkward situations, outrag
ing all sense of decency, which necessarily
ensue from such study in common. "With
the female students." they say, "cynicism
has entered our university"â and they Im
peratively demand the exclusion of female
students from the men's clinical courses,
appealing to the medical students of all
German universities to join in the protest.
The Berlin medical students have not fol
lowed the lead of their Halle brethren.
They have refused to let the protest be
fastened on their university blackboard.
In Halle itself an authoritative counter
declaration has appeared, signed by the
dean of the medical faculty. Professor
Weber. The complaints of the students
have been carefully considered by the
medical professors, and have been found
to rest partly on misunderstandings, part
ly, however, on direct misrepresentation.
Through their dean the medical professors
solemnly declare that neither morality
nor the* scientific gravity of clinical in
struction has suffered in any way since
the -admission of female students, nor
have the tone and general deportment in
the clinics and lecture theaters changed
for the worse in any way. They declare
the students' accusations to be totally un
founded, and deplore the animosity shown
by them against the female students,
which these latter have done absolutely
nothing to deserve, and they would not
hesitate to proceed against the authors of
the protest if they were not convinced
that they had not realized the full mean
ing of the step they had taken. Finally,
the professors hope that peace will soon,
be restored and the good feeling between
professors and students henceforth remain
undisturbed.â Philadelphia Medical Jour

CARDINALS.
Pope Leo Has Seen 124 Die in His
Pontificate.
The Romans have a* popular tradition
which, curiously enough, is often con
firmed by facts, that when a member of
the Sacred College dies two of his col
leagues quickly follow him. At a few
days' distance two cardinals, Bausa,
Archbishop of Florence, and Krementz,
Archbishop of Cologne, have departed this
life, and now good Romans are quite in a
flutter of expectation, speculating with
cheerful resignation as to which Tor
porato will be the third.
Apropos of the death of cardinals, it is
a curious fact that the most likely can
didates to the tiara, such as the late
Monaco la Valletta. Galimbertl, Di Rende.
Sanfellce. appear to have been specially
singled out by death during the pontifi
cate of Leo XIII. no fewer than 124 cardi
nals having died during the twenty-one
years of his reign. Indeed only four of
the cardinals created by Pius IX survive,
and should they cede the aged Pontiff
into the tomb Leo XIII will be able to
say to his cardinals, as Urban VIII did:
"Non vos elegistls me. sed ego elegi vos."
(It is not you who chose me. but I who
chose you.) There are now sixteen vacan

Dreyfus, to-day passed off much
as yesterday. Madame Dreyfus,
Matthieu Dreyfus, hit brother, j

Welcome.
__Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DETROIT, Mich., July s.â The after
noon of the preliminary day of the eigh
teenth annual international convention of
the christian Endeavor was showery, but
toward evening the sun broke through the
clouds and the travel from all parts of
the city to the Christian Endeavor
grounds began. Soon after sundown the
great tent, with a capacity of 10.000, was
filled: after that a crowd of outsiders ob
tained sight and hearing through the
dropping of tent walls at either side.
Promptly at 7:30 o'clock the comparative
silence was broken by the swelling strains
of "The Son of God Goes Forth to War,"
followed by "There Shall Be Showers of
Blessing" and "Onward. Christian Sol
diers." in all of which the great crowd
ioined. Devotional exercises were led by
the Rev. J. G. Butler of Washington. The
welcome of the local committee was ex
tended by William H. Strong, its chair
man. Rev. Charles B. Newman spoke on
behalf of the Detroit .tors. .
Mayor Mavbury, in his welcoming
speech' praised the work of the Endeavor
ers and declared that all Detroit Joined In
the welcome to the deb gates and visitors.
There were encores of applause when
Secretary Baer read the following tele
gram from the President of the United
States:
Rev. Dr. Francis E. Clark. Detroit, Mich.:
On the occasion of the eighteenth international
convention of your society. I desire to express
mv cordial interest in Its work, my best wishes
to" those assembled with you In convention and
mv earnest hope of the continuance and in
crease nf great results which the efforts of
Christian Endeavor societies have achieved.
WILLIAM MCKINLEY.
Next en the programme- came responses
in behalf of Endeavorers from the foreign
lands. As Rev. William Patterson of
Toronto me forward to speak for Can
ada some one struck up "'God Save the
Queen." The Canadians on the platform
took up the strain and in a moment the
huge tent was reverberating with the
swelling chorus of the British anthem.
The friendly relations .-...;( Canada
and the United States, especially with ref
erence to religious matters, formed the
burden of Dr. Patterson's address.
Rev. Dr. if. J. Tressider. secretary of
the London Council of Christian En
deavor, answered the greetings on behalf
of Great Britain.
"Perish the mad dream." he said, "that
a conflict should ever come between our
two countries. It Is the work and the
duty of the Christian Endeavorers to
make Impossible such an Idea."
For Australia responses were made by
Rev. Joseph Walker of Queensland; for
china by Rev. Blw< d G. Tewkesbury, a
missionary in the vicinity of Peking; for
Turkey by Rev. Lyndon S. Crawford, for
many years a missionary In that country;
for Japan by Rev. Otis Carey; for Mexico
by Rev. C. Scott Williams, and for the
United States by Rev. Arthur J. Smith
of Georgia.
At the close of the big meeting the ,
crowd thronged to the platform to be pre-
I* ted to the Mayor and the officers of
tile United Society. This closed the first
flay of what promises to be one of the
most notable gatherings in the history of
the organization.

the Los Angeles Theater, has* to Fa}- regarding
my taking the management of the Burbank
Theater, I thought it about time to inform you
of the facts. When Wyatt visited San Fran
cisco he called and informed me that the Bur
bank was without a lessee, and suggested that
it would be a good idea for me and him to take
the house and conduct it as a stock house.
I told him that if I concluded to take the
theater I would take It alone or not at all. I
Informed him I would play my company and
not combinations. I had it published that the
Burbank Theater under my management would
not be conducted as a combination house. I
cave Wyatt and others a. chance to bid for the
house, which they did.
The beginning of th*-* battle royal be
tween the two theaters may come sooner
than expected, as Morosco may bring to

TEST SUIT AFFECTING
COUNTRY NEWSPAPERS
Attempt to Prevent Duplicate Publi
cation of Santa Clara's Tax
List.
BAN JOSE, July s.â The right of the
Board of Supervisors to order the print
ing of portions of the delinquent tax
list In the papers of the various town
ships of the county is to be tested in
court. It has been customary for the
several Supervisors to give this printing
to papers in their districts as patronage
for support during the campaign, in
addition to the Tax Collector choosing
a paper for the official publication of
the full list.
Complaint was made to District At
torney Campbell that this was a ruth
less expenditure of the people's money,
and a few days ago that official warned
the Supervisors that the "farming out"
of the tax list was illegal. The County
Auditor was warned against allowing
any of the claims.
It was decided to test the matter, and
to-day a mandamus suit was com
menced by S. T. Moore, on an assigned
claim by George A. Eddes.- to direct
County Auditor T. F. Morrison to pay
a claim for $16 for the publishing of a
delinquent tax list In the Morgan Hill
Sun for Burnett Township. It recites
in defense of the action of the Super
visors that in thus printing the tax list
the "order was so given for the sole
purpose of affording those who were
named in the delinquent tax lists full
notice of all matters therein stated, in
cluding the time fixed for the sale of
the property."
The case will come up In the Superior
Court on Monday morning, when a per
emptory writ will be asked for direct
ing the County Auditor to pay the
claim of Moore from the current ex
pense fund. Fifteen weekly papers will
be affected by the decision and the
country editors are greatly Interested
in the outcome. *

SCORES THE EARL
FRUIT COMPANY
Growers' Association's
Complaint.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, July s.â At a meet
ing of the board of directors of the
Fruit Growers' Association to-day the
following statement was adopted and
sent out by Secretary F. C. Niles:
The action of the Earl Fruit Company !
at Suisun on June 28 last in refusing to I
give crate material to F. A. Chadbourn Is j
one to be combated by all fruit growers.
If any company or corporation largely en
gaged in handling California fruits" can
dictate as to whom it will or will not
serve, it amounts to an attempt to destroy
the value of the property owned by the
grower discriminated against.
The directors, knowing that unless some
action be Immediately taken in regard to
the discrimination against the growers,
announce to the fruit growers that where
any company refuses to furnish, them
with supplies, it has made arrangements
whereby growers may obtain the same.
All fruit growers are requested to ad
dress the secretary at Penryn on the sub
ject of discrimination, giving full de
tails:
E. T. Earl, in an interview, said his
company carried a limited supply of
box material used for Eastern ship
ments in all the principal districts,
and was always glad to accommodate
growers who were shipping through his
firm with material at market prices.
Chadbourn, he understood, was not
shipping fruit East through the Earl
Company nor any other firm, and the
material was wanted for San Francisco
shipment. There are numerous box
factories in the State that make a busi
ness of supplying material for San
Francisco shipments, and It was not
the custom of the Earl Company to
carry supplies for this purpose.
Mr. Earl said the agitation which,
been carried on by a few individuals
during the last few weeks was to be
deplored, as there was never a time
when growers were realizing as. good
prices for fruit as this season. Facili
ties for shipping and marketing were
never better, transportation charges
were lower than ever before and grow
ers who desired to sell their fruit rather
than ship East on their own account
had no trouble in finding plenty of
buyers.

WHITE'S PLEA SUCCESSFUL
a
PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROP
ERTY AT SEA DURING WAR.
.
Special Conference to Be Summoned
Hereafter to Consider the Plan
Proposed by the United
States.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
THE HAGUE, July s.â The American
: delegates scored a great success to-day
| in obtaining from the Peace Conference
I a unanimous vote in favor of having
I the question of private property at sea
; in time of war referred to a special con
! ference to be summoned hereafter.
Much diplomatic management was
] necessary and many obstacles had
, been surmounted before this result was
'â â  reached.
The second committee met this morn
ing, and Andrew D. "White, head of the
American delegation, broached the sub
ject. The question of its admissibility
under the conference mandate was dis
cussed. No vote was taken, but an
agreement was arrived at to allow th.
Americans to present their case in full
this afternoon. Had a vote been taken
immediately the Americans would
doubtless have carried their point by
a majority of one or two, and to avoid
this a resolution was proposed, recog
nizing the importance and complexity
of the question and recommending the
summoning of a special conference.
At the afternoon sitting of the com
mittee the successive clauses of the
laws of war -having been adopted, M.
de Mertens of the Russian delegation
moved a resolution to that effect.
Mr. White seconded it. In the course
of a clear and eloquent statement of
the American case, he said the Ameri
can Government had accepted the invi
tation to participate In the conference
with alacrity, because of the opportun
ity it was expected the conference,
would afford for preaching the truth
with regard to the immunity from cap
ture of private property at sea. He
admitted, however, that the United
States Government recognized it would
be hopeless to expect any decisive reÂ«
suit from this conference, owing to the
three causes, absence of instruction or
power from the governments: second,
doubts as to the competence of. the con
ference, and third, the length of time
necessary for a discussion of all the
bearings of the case.
Mr. White frankly admitted the diffi
culties involved in deciding what con
stituted the contraband of war. but in
sisted that these supplied one of the
best arguments for a full and promi
nent discussion. The suffering and
losses which seizures entailed are im
mense, while the effect upon the ulti
mate result of war was almost noth
ing.
Referring to the experience of the
United States in the war of the re
bellion, he said that only three Con
federate cruisers did anything of im
portance, but they captured 169 ves
sels, quadrupled the rate of insurance
between America and Great Britain,
and caused the transfer of a half mil
lion tons of American shipping to Brit
ish bottoms. The final result was that
the whole American marine was vir
tually swept out of existence.
"If that resulted from the operations
of the three poorly equipped little
steamers." he continued, *' what would
have happened with the means at the
disposal of the greater nations of to
day? Yet every one knows that this
privateering had not the slightest effect
in ending or even shortening the war.
nor would It have had any even if the
losses had been ten times greater. The
only real effect Is gained by warships in
maintaining a blockade. Nowadays the
transfer of goods by land is so general
that Interruption by sea as a rule does
nothing to promote the ending of the
war, but that interruption may destroy
accumulations of human wealth and
skill requiring a generation to make
good, while the losses cannot be con
fined to belligerents alone, but must
affect more or less directly the whole
world."
Mr. White warmly repudiated the
supposition that the Americans were
animated by selfish considerations.
They were eminently practical, he
said, but not less pre-eminently de
voted to great ideals. This he illus
trated by referring to the enormous
sacrifice made during the civil war and
the devotion of Americans to arbitra
tion. But the question he was urging
upon the delegates, he asserted, was
one of right, justice and progress of
the whole world, and this all Ameri
cans felt deeply. Nor could the accept
ance of the American proposal injure
any nation, but, on the contrary, it
would strengthen all.
The head of the American delegation
concluded with an eloquent appeal to
the jurists, diplomatists and statesmen
of all nations assembled in the confer
ence to take the subject under careful
consideration, declaring in the words
of Count Nesselrode that "the addi
tions of this plea to international law
would be a crown of glory to the
world's diplomacy."
M. Rahusen of the Dutch delegation
supported Mr. White and suggested
that the Governments favoring the
idea should conclude treaties among
themselves.
Sir Julian Pauncefote. head of the
British delegation, said that British
opinion was divided on the subject and
that he had no instructions regarding
it. In his personal opinion the ques
tion was outside the scope of, the con
ference. .
M. Bourgeois, head of the French del
egation, and Captain Schein of the
Russian delegation, announced that in
the absence of instructions they could
not vote. The resolution was then put
and carried without opposition, with
the reservations on the part of Great
Britain. France and Russia.
The committee also adopted a resolu
tion that the question of the determina
tion of rights and duties of the several
states should be placed on the pro
gramme of a future conference.
The plenary conference assembled
subsequently and accepted all the reso
lutions of the committee.
The American delegation is much
gratified at the result. The delegates
could not anticipate a practical issue at
this time. The maximum success pos
sible was full and free opinion of plac
ing the American view on record and
of continuing unbroken the tradition
of a century of American protest in be
half of progressive ideas In interna
tional law. This result, which at one
time appeared impossible, owing to the
almost insuperable' difficulties. Is now
triumphantly attained.

i Monsignor Diomede Falconio Is an Italian by birth but an American citi
_Â» zen by virtue of naturalization. He was born in Calabria, and is about 55

Â© ventura. at Allegheny, N. Y. He was then a youth of 24, and had already
4- attended a seminary in his native province in Italy. Upon the completion of
ft his studies at Allegheny he was ordained as a priest by the then Bishop
x Timon of Buffalo. Then he became a teacher ln his Alma Mater. After a
1. few months the young priest was sent to the diocese of Havre de Grace, in
" Newfoundland, where he was speedily elevated to the rank of vicar general
*â¦* of the diocese. Such advancement to a rank surpassed only by that of
O bishop called speedy attention to the executive abilities of the young man.
4- It occasioned little .surprise when he was drafted by his order to Italy, and
Â© by the Pope created Bishop of Accrenza and Matera.
4- Early in 1885 Archbishop Falconio went to New York and undertook the
O humble and laborious work of his order among the Italians of the lower west

WASHINGTON, July 5. Surgeon
General Sternberg has received the
following cable from Major O'Reilly,
chief surgeon at Havana, giving the
yellow fever situation:
'â¢Harvard (chief surgeon at Santiago)
telegraphed to-day that the total cases
were about one hundred, with twenty
one deaths. Surgeon Clondennin died
yesterday; other medical officers are
sick and three nurses, Of our two
camps one is safe and the other located
in the foothills, five miles away, and
will probably be moved in a few days.
On* case is "reported from Manaanillo.
In order to make more effective the
quarantine against the introduction of
yellow* fever from Vera Cruz and other
infected Mexican cities the surgeon
general of the Marine Hospital service
has located Assistant Surgeon L. E.

A report has been received from the
Consul at that city, saying that the
present epidemic followed upon the dis

this report as strongly confirmatory < _

The steel boom and steel gaff have been
shipped. The immense area of mainsail

Work of the Sen
ators.
-- â¦ â
-Some important changes have been
made In the relative positions of the
teams during the past week. The two
great surprises were the double victories j
of Oakland and San Jose over Santa Cruz
and San Francisco. Watsonville has been
the only team to suffer that could well
afford to have its percentage reduced. By
winning its Fourth of July game Santa
Cruz broke even on the week and main
tains a lead of 96 points over San Fran
rise... which, by losing three of the last
four games played, has fallen away con
siderably. San Jose by its excellent work
has moved up to third position and is now
only forty points behind the locals. Sac- ;
ramento has also been doing great work
and the tallender of two weeks ago Is now
In fourth place, Watsonville having fallen
back to fifth position. Oakland is still in
the hole, but with an Increased percent
age. The standing of the teams follows:

The games scheduled for this week j
promise to be unusually exciting. Wat
sonville will try conclusions with the
home team at Recreation Park and Golden j
Gate, and if some new material the Wat- t
sonville management is expecting arrives,
Harris' men will have to hustle to take
a malority of the series. A battle-royal \
will be fought at San Jose between the
Dentists and Lobsters. So far this season ,
San Jose has not won a game from. Santa ;
Cruz, but before returning home Tuesday
night Dr. McGraw declared his Indians
would make it two straight this week.
Oakland will go to Sacramento, and as
both teams are picking up there will be a
hot fight on between them.
Oakland has signed Steffani to alternate
Willi Moskiman and Shea in the box, and
the San Jos.- lad, judging from his work
last Tuesday, will have no trouble in hold
ing his own. lie has a good assortment of
curves under control and even such, ghost- \
dancers as Dalrymple and ODea fail to
disconcert him. Ford. Oakland's new
first baseman, shows up well in the field
but is weak with the stick yet. Last year
Ford ranked with the heavy batters, and I
he thinks that with a little practice he i
will regain his batting eye. One excellent i
change that has been made in the team
is the revision of the batting order. Why
Schmeer. who Is a weak batter, has been i
kept at the head of the list and Hardie,
one of the best stickers in the league.
placed eighth in the list was something
that not even Cal Ewlng himself could
explain. It is all different now. Peeples
and Hammond, both good average bat
ters, lead off and old Automobile Lou fol
lows with his bludgeon to drive them
home. Oakland will win games under the
new order.
The new managers of the Watsonville
team deserve great credit for the deter
mination they have shown to place a win
ning ball team in the league, and best of
all to enforce discipline. McCarthy who
Is a line shortstop and also a confirmed
trouble breeder, has been indefinitely sus
pended for insubordination. His suspen
sion has already been telegraphed on to
Nick Young and now McCarthy cannot
get a job with any national agreement
team in the country until the suspension
is raised. It took nerve to do this, for
McCarthy's retirement meant the crip
pling of the team, but the managers were
determined to enforce discipline even if
it cost games to do it. They are now ne
gotiating with several Eastern players
who are said to be cracks in their par
ticular positions, and when the weak
spots are patched up the team will be
up With the leaders again.
Watsonville pays good salaries and the
patrons of the game In that town de
ma:..! a winning team. This the managers
are determined they shall have.
Anderson of San Jose doesn't create
much excitement, but he goes about his
work in a quiet, determined manner that
has placed him in the front rank of sec
ond basemen. In tlie series with San-
Francisco last week Anderson accepted
thirty out of thirty-one chances and some
of them were corkers.
Leake, the San Jose shortstop, Ims got
down tc his gait and is now playing great
i ball; besides hint*!-* nicely. Last Tues
; day his work was as clean as could be
asked for. However, the youngster will
: not be with the team a great while longer,
] for with the beginning of the semester he
will return to Santa Clara College. Dr.
McGraw is already casting about for a
man lo fill the vacancy and has opened
up correspondence with several first-class
Eastern men.
Manager Harris has made a slight
change in his batting order. Hilderbrandt,
who is doing some fine sticking now leads
off, Pyne being fifth in the list. Both
l';. n.- and Riley have dropped off sur
prisingly in their batting of late.
Since Manager Ewing has been away
on his vacation the Oakland team has
braced up wonderfully, and now the boys
dc clare that < 'a! it their hoodoo. They
say they are going to bar him from the
games hereafter altogether. Ed Johnson
is managing the team With marked ability
during i-.-.\ Ing's absence.
Doyle of Sacramento is causing Hank
Harris' hair to break off. Doyle does all
Sorts of things to tin- locals whenever
! they go against him. He Is also keeping
I the other teams guessing these days.
Sacramento is coming up with a rush.
> Doyle and Harvey are both doing effective
! box work and the team is giving them
| great support, besides slugging like fiends.
; The Senators are nov. playing the kind of
! ball that won them the pennant last year.
Even Donlin, the last time he faced
Kripp's men, was hatted all over the lot.
[berg, who was the star twirler of the
! league last season, Is having a hard time
j of it this year.'^ftn the last five weeks the
j locals have lost every game he has
: pitched.
Andrews Is doing magnificent box work
' for the Dentists. With Borchers holding
I up his end the club will be a prominent
â  factor in the championship fight.
With Donlln gone it would occasion no
; surprise if the Lobsters struck the chutes.
Dr. McGraw is determined to make a
success of the game in San Jose. He has
1 engaged Champion Jeffries to umpire next
Saturday's game with Santa Cruz and to
spar four rounds with Jim Daly, his spar
ring partner, at the conclusion of the
j game. The champion will receive $300 for
! his services.
Th.re is hot .a league in the country that
I is playing such even ball as the Califor
nia league. It is very seldom that a lop
sided score is turned out, while efforts to
pick the winners have proved most dis
i tressing. San Francisco has been particu
larly fortunate in having exciting con
tests. â  / . _

HEAVY WEIGHTS ON
THE HURDLE HORSES
OFFICERS MAY INTERFERE
WITH MOORE CUP RACE.
A Protest Against the Mount Condi
tions in the Coming Event of
the San Mateo Hunt
Club.
Is it cruelty to animals, and a violation
of the. laws, to make a horse run two and
a. half miles, and jump over ten hurdles
while carrying 200 pounds weight? Thi
question is likely to be settled in the
courts of San Mateo County in the near
future. The rase promises to be of more
'than ordinary interest, as such Wealthy
men as Walter S. Hobart and the "upper
ten" of Burllngame are likely to be in
volved in the matter. On the 15th of this
month there is to be a society event in
that part of San Mateo County commonly
called "Bllngum," In which the shining
lights of that district will take part. The
principal feature is to be a hurdle rac
ier the J. J. Moore silver cup. Only mem
bers of San Mateo Hunt Clud may
enter the race. This is the club which
follows the hounds on horseback, Just ad
the gentlefolks do in the old country.
in this organization there is one or two
horsemen whom nature has blessed, or
otherwise, with avoirdupois over jo.key
weight, ln fact they weigh over fourteen
stone (short), and realizing their handi
cap have Induced the other members of
the club to so arrange the conditions of
the race over hurdles and around the
track that things will be evened up in
the matter of avoirdupois. This can only
be accomplished by the riders of small
statue adding scrap iron, lead or other
heavy substances to their mounts. How
the ponies, which have to do the running
and jumping, would regard this proposi
tion Is not known.
However, there are a number of men
who do not think that this arrangement
is Just right to the animals. One of these
telephoned yesterday to Secretary 11,1
--brook of the Society, for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals and register, a
protest in the name of suffering .horse
flesh. Mr. Holbrook also takes the view
that it is piling it on too thick upon the
horse, and he is determined to prevent
such a contest of freight carrying, if pos
sible. â  "Bllngum" Is really out of his dis
trict, but he proposes to operate as a citi
zen for the enforcement of the laws
through the officers of San Mateo County.
While Mr. Hobart' 8 race track, upon
which the two and one-half hurdle race is
to take place, Is on strictly private
grounds, still Mr. Holbrook contends that
the officers have a right to prevent the
commission of an offense on any one's
property.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HENLEY-ON-THAMES, July This
-was the second day of the Henley regatta,
and though the weather was beautiful
Henley on the whole seemed much less
crowded than usual on such occasions.
In the first heat for the challenge cup,
eights, the Argonauts (Toronto, Canada)
beat the Dutch crew by two feet. Time,
7 minutes 6 seconds. The Delft students
in the Dutch boat started very badly,
rowing 34, while the Argonauts got well
away at 40 and secured a lead of a length
before the Dutchmen knew where they
were. Above the island the Dutchmen
caught the Canadians, and led at Fawley
Court In . minutes 19 seconds 'by the
length of their forward canvas. Thence
there was a terrific struggle. The Cana
dians spurted again and again, and Just
as they leached the post succeeded in
getting the nose of their boat in front.
The time made Is considered very fast.
It is. the general opinion that the Argo
nauts had a narrow escape from defeat.
In the second beat the London Rowing
Club ben; the Thames Rowing Club by a
length and a half. Time, 7:25.
In the third heat the London Club beat
Railiol College by a length and a quarter.
Time, 7:11.
In the fourth heat Trinity College. Ox

In the second heat for the Thames

In the fifth heat the Kingston Rowing
Club beat the Thames Rowing Club.
Kingston won by a length in 7:37.
In the second heat of the diamond
sculls, singles, Howell (American), Cam
bridge, beat Bright of the Argonauts.
Bright did not have the ghost of a chance
with Howell, who jumped off in the lead
and was clear of Ins opponent before they
reached the end of the island. Thence
Howell paddled ahead, increasing his lead
as he liked. ,*- 'â '-;', ---'â¢ , â
In the first heat for the diamond sculls

In the third heat of the diamond sculls
Hemmerde, Oxford, beat Goldman of the

man The Oxonian started with a stroke
of thirty-four to Goldman's thirty-eight
and led before leaving the island. At the
rectory Hemmerde was a half-length
ahead and at Fawley Court, which was
reached In four minutes and one second
he was almost clear. Hemmerde steered
badly subsequently, but won by a length

KILLING YOUNG FISH.
Ten Chinese Law-Breakers Arrested
Near Redwood City.
Several days ago the information was
taken to the office of the Fish Commission
that the Chinese shrimp fishers were at
work again in the lower bay. Over a doz
en of these fellows have been arrested
there within the past month, but still they
oersHt in the business, which is the
means of killing off till of the little fish
that get within the limits of the nets.
On Monday Deputies Davis and Cross
made a run in the commission launch
Qulnnat and near Redwood City two
shrimp fishing junks were discovered. In
a short time these were overhauled and
found to contain several tons of shrimp.
young sole and flounders. As there is no
law protecting the shell fish the .offenders,
ten in number, were charged with violat
ing the law which prohibits the killing
of young sole. ;..'â¢' v" - .
The Chinese were taken to Redwood
City, where each was obliged to give $30
ball for his. release. The Justice of the
Peace refused to â  be bullied into reduc
ing the bail, and it is evident from his
expressions that he is in favor of the pro
tecting of the food fishes of these wa
ters. The time for hearing the cases has
not yet been set.
A Wealthy "Drunk."
C. H. Shaw, who is connected with the
Compressed Air Company of i*>enver.
Colo., was taken to the City Prison yes
terday afternoon from Kapp & Street's
saloon on Market street and booked as
"drunk." The saloon-keepers notified
the police as a precautionary measure,
as Shaw was carelessly handling money
and might get into bad company and lose
it. When searched at the prison he had
a hag containing $1320 in gold, and in his
pockets was $2 35 in silver. He had
drawn, it was said. $2000 from the bank
yesterday morning and that was all that
was left of it.

ONWENTSIA CLUB GOLF GROUNDS,
Lake Forest, 111., July s.â Only one !
Western man now remains to battle for i
the amateur golf championship In the |
tournament at Onwentsia. To-day's ,
game saw the downfall of four out of :
live Westerners, who were successful in
yesterday's match games. Walter Fair
banks of the Overland Park Club of Den
ver was vanquished by 11. P. Toler of the
.Balturol Golf Club; D. K. Forgan went j
down before the prowess of Champion
Findlay S. Douglass; William Holabird
Jr., the sixteen-year-old player of the
Glenview Golf Club of Chicago, was
beaten by another Westerner, C. B. Mc-
Donald of the Chicago Golf Club, while
Walter B. Smith of the Onwentsia Club
runner-up in last year's tournament or ,
the Morris County Course, was defeated I
after a hard struggle by J. G. Thorp of
the Oakley Country Club of Cambridge, j
Mass. The playing of Mr. Douglass was
prominently the feature of the day.
The biggest surprise of the day was the
defeat ot Walter B. Smith, last year's ;
runner-up, by J. G. Thorp. Mr. Thorp, i
who was runner against Whlgham at
Shinnecock Hills in 1896, displayed par
ticularly good form during this tourna- I
ment, but Smith had been doing such
good work that he was picked to win over
his Eastern opponents by a majority of
the golfers present.
Judging from the attendance at the play ;
during the afternoon it Is probable that ,
to-morrow's play will be followed by more
lovers of the game than at any time dur
ing the tournament. The rain ceased tnis
afternoon and the sun and wind quickly '
dried up the course, leaving it ln splendid |
condition for to-morrow.
The results of the day's play were as
follows:

James J. Jeffries, who wrested the box
! ing championship of the world from Fltz
; simmons, is due to arrive here at 9:.5 a.
! m. . to-day. The train on which he la
traveling, however, is five hours late, but
! it is expected that two hours of this will
[ be made up before the end of his Journey.
: He will be met at the ferry by a delega
-1 tion of friends and admirers, including
many sporting men of this city, Oakland
and Los Angeles. Accompanied by a band
of music they will escort the conquering
hero to the Palace Hotel, where an in
j formal reception will be held. â¢-'-'
A formal reception will be held at 8
o'clock in the evening, prior to the ap
pearance of the champion in Woodward's
Pavilion. "Jeff," as his familiars ad
dress him. will box with his brother
! "Jack" and with Alex. Greggains. .
For those who like a little hard punch
ing mixed with their boxing there will
i be three ten-round bouts, with Greggains
ias referee. He always finds a way to
i bring out all the pugnacity in a boxer's
nature and this occasion should prove no
exception to the rule. Jeffries' father will
'be present and Tom Sharkey, the re
i doubtable sailor, has also consented to
j appear and lend tone to the occasion.
The National Club has matched Jack
: Kane and Rufe Turner, the colored boxer
! from Stockton, for a ten-round bout on
i the 20th inst., when George Green and
Charlie Goff meet at Woodward's Pavil
ion. Kane stopped a man fully twenty
pounds heavier than himself at the San
! Francisco Athletic Club last Thursday
i night. He entered the ring without any
! preparation and made a brilliant showing.
; Turner has just leaped into prominence
: by defeating Cocker Tweedie, the marvel
i ous Australian boxer, at Stockton.
! Tweedie was apparently knocked out, but
experts at the ringside hold to the opinion
i that he feigned unconsciousness.
Efforts are being made to match Billy
, Otts and Spider Kelly for a twenty-round
bout on August 2 when Nelll and McCon
i nell again measure their skill. Otts in
! sists on Kelly posting a forfeit of $250
1 that he will weigh in at 133 pounds on the
night of the fight. It is expected this
matter will be arranged to-day.
Joe Kennedy has not had to wait long
i for a match, his services being in demand
iln the East. He has already consented
' to meet Childs, a clever colored boxer,
who ranks among the best of the heavy
! welkh*-s outside men in the championship
| class. They will box twenty rounds be-
I fore an Eastern club.

able.
âa
The Republican County Committee
will meet this evening and adopt a plan
to apportion delegates to the next mu
nicipal invention of the party. The
plan must be filed in th** office of the
Board of Election Commissioners be
fore Saturday night of this week.
A committee appointed early in June
to prepare a scheme of apportionment
was expected to report at the meeting
of the general committee Thursday of
last week, but owing to the conflicting
views of committeemen further time
was granted.
A plan known as the blanket ticket
Â» proposition is advocated by several
members of the County Committee, but
is not commended, by the great mass
of Republican electors. The advocates
of this plan propose that the names of
all the delegates to the convention
shall be placed on' one ticket, and that
the ticket be voted for at large by all
the Republican electors of the city.
Leading Republicans of th- various
Assembly â â â ,-;> object to the pro
posed method of apportionment on the
ground that it would deprive the dis
tricts of direct representation in the
convention. The call is informed that
the apportionment committee will re
port this evening, recommending a
large convention, nd that th- delegates
thereto shall be chosen by each As
sembly district voting for its own rep
resentatives. Under this plan Repub
licans of the North Beach section of
the city will not be asked to vote for
the delegates to represent the Mission
districts^ and neither will the voters in
the Western* Addition be called on to
name the delegates to represent South
San Francisco in the convention.
The committee considered the sug
gestion of giving each precinct a dele
gate, but it was deemed advisable to
recognize the Assembly districts as the
unit. In the nreparation of the As
sembly district ticket, the rights of the
respective precincts will no doubt be
considered. It is not possible to obtain
equal representation ,of Republican
strength on a plan giving each pre
cinct a delegate. It would not be fair.
from a party standpoint, to give a pre
cinct which cast only 100 Republican
votes at the last election as large a
representation in the convention as
that accorded to a precinct which cast
2 1 '") Republican vol at the same elec
tion. The same principle may apply to
Assembly districts. No doubt the com
mittee will report a plan to base dis
trict representation on the number of
Republican votes cast at the general
election last November.
The plan of giving each Assembly
district representation on the basis of
population may favorably commend it
self to progressive Republicans. The
prospects are that the people of the
city, without regard to political affilia
tion of the past, will turn to the Re
publican party to obtain municipal re
forms so much desired. The Demo
cratic campaign has already degener
ated into factional strife for the
spoils. Buckley, backed by the South
ern Pacific Railroad, is seeking to re
establish his political power in San
Francisco. The Democratic County
Committee of One Hundred is fighting
Buckley in every district, while Rainey
and Lawrence are scheming to get con
trol of the convention through inde
pendent clubs.
The non-partisans regard the new
primary election law as the product of
hossism in ties. They have taken
no steps to avail themselves of the good
provisions of the plan, but on the con.
trary have engaged counsel to assail
the law and invoke the courts to re
strain the Election Commissioners from
carrying out its provisions. Non-parti
san conventions in San Francisco are
usually composed' of Republicans who
want good government and Democrats
who want good offices. Henceforth it
may he best for Republicans who have
in the past given the non-partisan
movement its chief element of strength
to seek good government through Re
publican conventions created according
to the provisions of the new primary
law.
Democrats Enjoy Themselves.
The Thirtieth District Democratic Club I
held a largely attended feting last night
at Pythian Castle, on Market street. In
addition to speeches on the Issues of the

by local talent, and the serving of re
freshments added interest to the affair. I

Now that the Fourth of July celebration
of l*-i# has, with its acompanying din and
i roar and gala display of military pomp.
! passed into tory, the real troubles of
I the committee which had charge of the
I celebration have commenced. As usual,
j there Is impending danger of a deficiency
: in th- funds, and the members of th
executive committee are beginning to
! figure out where they can raise the neces
! sary funds to liquidate all their bills in
| case the possible deficiency becomesa stern
! reality. The bills were to have been au
i dited " for payment by the proper com
: mittee la.st night, but as only a few mem-
I bers of the committee presented tnem
! selves at the headquarters the meeting
i of the executive committee and the audit-
Ing committee was postponed until next
' Saturday afternoon. ,
It is stated by those who are supposed
ito wield considerable fiuence in the -x
ecutive committee that at the next meet-
Ing Colonel T. P. Robinson, who was ex
! pelled from the committee for alleged
| complicity with J. M. Chretien in an at-
I tempt to" extort $50 from A. S. Baldwin,
I will t<? exonerated and restored to caste
| in the committee before it adjourns sine
die. Robinson and several of his intimate
! friends claim that a majority of the com
mittee have signified their willingness to
pursue such a course for the reason that
the evidence against Robinson was in
sufficient and that he was not given a sep
arate and impartial hearing, as was
: Chretien. Several prominent members of
i the committee, including Chairman Flet-
I cher, believe that a grave injustice was
| done Robinson.
The presence of Robinson on the. stage
; at Metropolitan Temple and the zealous
i interest he displayed getting the various
! bodies in their proper places in the line
' of march was the subject of much com
i ment yesterday among the members or
i the committee, and others interested in the
i celebration. It seems that Colonel Robin
i son was invited by authoritative persons
j to assist the committee because of his
| absolute familiarity with celebration af
i fairs. _*_'-""''-'_
Much regret was felt by hundreds of
1 spectators along the line of march that
I the navy was unrepresented in the parade.
: Ii has now come to light that the parade
! committee had not neglected its duties
! but had sent a cordial and pressing mvi!
-! tation to the officers of the Philadelphia
to participate in the celebration.
When the committee was advised that
' th.- Philadelphia was coming to this city
' it wired Congressman Kahn to wire to
! Seeretarv of the Navy Long, which he
! did. through the courtesy of the Western
I Union Telegraph Company, asking that
j an order be issued that the Philadelphia
! remain in San Francisco harbor and* that
; the. officers and crew be authorized to
! take part In the parade. An answer was
i received from Secretary Long to the ,-._.
: feet that the Philadelphia had been or
! dered to Mare Island for necessary re
-1 pairs and that the vessel in all probability
! would not be in the harbor on the day of
: celebration. A cordial invitation was sent
to Rear Admiral Kautz, asking his par
ticipation and that of his officers and
crew. A reply was received to the effect
that 100 of the crew had been discharged
since their arrival in this harbor and as
the vessel was about to proceed to Mare
Island for repairs and there being nc
means for transportation at hand from
1 the navy-yard to this city for the remain-
I der of the crew the invitation could not be
j accepted.
Mayor Phelan and Congressman Kahn
i both * generously offered to provide th.
necessary transportation, but Admiral
i Kautz was of the belief that as the
j greater portion of the crew had been dis
| charged the remainder could not make a
j proper showing., and for that reason the
J invitation was declined and the United
j States navy was not represented in the
[ parade. .

Christian Merkei Lacks Physical
Ability to Cope With His Wife.
Christian Merkei, a piano polisher, re
siding at 1362 Minna street, called at the
Seventeenth street police station last
night with a crushed hat and abrased nose.
He wanted to see Captain Gillen in per
son. After being" shown into the presence
of that august official Merkei invoked po
lice protection from the onslaughts of his
wife. He stated that he had 'been in bed
when the wife of his bosom entered the
room* and with a glass saluted him on the
olfactory organ. Not content with this
demonstration of her affection, she danced
on his stovepipe and then waltzed out of
the room. In stating his inability to pro
tect himself he admitted that he lacked
the physical ability to cope with her and
was afraid to go home unless a guardlau
of the peace accompanied him. Being per
mitted to select a guardian. Merkei chose
Officer Edner as a man possessed of suf
ficient grit to hold his own against the
boisterous wife.

| in which millions are involved, and he will
! remain here until November, laboring to
| incorporate a California automobile com
-1 pany, which will manufacture the horse
| less traction engine.
The New York Auto-Truck Company is
a corporation which has the wealth and
influence of some of the biggest financiers
and politicians in the East back of it. Its
stockholders and directors are Richard
Croker, Joseph Leiter, Joseph Hoadley,
Nathan Straus, Senator A. P. Gorman
and the Cramps o*f Philadelphia. These
men have organized no less than five big
auto-truck corporations, one for New
York, another for Pennsylvania, the third
in Massachusetts, which is to supply the
New England States with automobiles of
every description, the fourth in Chicago
and the fifth for California. The capitali
zation of the California auto-truck com
pany is fixed at $5,000,00- and Is organized
under the laws of New Jersey. Taylor is i
intrusted with the duties of operative
formation, and his trip to this State was
mad.- with the sole intention of complet
ing all necessary details to secure the in
terest of local capitalists in the new ven
ture. The Eastern stockholders have
promised to give their money and support
to a Western plant if $500*000 of preferred
stock will be taken up by local business
men. If this is accomplished San Fran- j

The woman
who suffers from weakness and disease of
[ the distinctly feminine organs, whether she
â  realizes it or not, is being slowly but surely
I tortured to death. She suffers almost con-
â  tinually with sick headache. She has pains
! * in the back, what she calls "stitches" in the
|- side and shooting pains everywhere. She
! experiences burning and dragging down
! sensations. She becomes weak, nervous-
; and destjpndent. She neglects her home,
i and is petulant with her husband. If she
! consults the avenge physician, there is not
i one chance in ten that he will hit upon the
I real cause of her trouble. He will attribute
| her bad feeling's to stomach, liver, heart or
I nervous trouble. A woman in this condi-
I tion should consult some eminent and skill-
I ful specialist who has had a wide experi-
i ence. Dr. R. V. Pierce, for thirty years
- chief consulting physician to the Invalids'
j Hotel and Surgical Institute, at Buffalo,
j N. V.. has. with the assistance of a staff of
j able physicians, prescribed for many thou-
! sands of women. He has invented a won-
derful medicine for ailing women, known
, as Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription. It
has stood the test for thirty years. It acts
i directly on the delicate and important or-
gans concerned in wifehood and mother-
' hood, making them strong and well. It
allays inflammation, heals ulceration,
: soothes pain and tones and builds up the
nerves. It transforms weak, nervous wom-
en into healthy, happy wives and mothers.
" I was an invalid for over a year with chance
of life." writes Mrs. C. Smith, of Orr, Cascade
Co., Mont. "Had pains across the pit of ray
; stomach and such extreme weakness I could
hardly walk. I took one bottle of Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery and five of his 'Fa-
vorite Prescription ' and am entirely well."

clsco may have an automobile plant and
build its own silent and inanimate steeds,
compressed air serving as the motive
power.
The New York Auto-Truck Company is
dovetailed with the International Power
Company of New York, a corporation
which owns the exclusive patent-right to
use compressed air as a means of locomo
tion. The construction of automobile ap
paratus for the New York Auto-Truck
Company is the work of the International
Power Company, whose plant is situated
in Providence, R. I.
"For traction purposes auto-trucks are
Immeasurably superior to the old methods
of locomotion." said Howard P. Taylor
last night. "The time will come, and it
is not far off, when street cars, drays,
carriages and passenger coaches will use
compressed air for motive power. It is
cheaper, performs more work and entails
a less- expenditure of energy. "We are
manufacturing auto-trucks of every de
scription with a rapidity that means the
disuse of the horse as a beast of burden.
If local men take sufficient interest in this
matter San Francisco will have Its own
plant in the near future."

SUCCESSIVE MONOPOLY DEFEATS.
THERE is a socialistic use of the conception of j
monopoly to which The Call can never sub- 1
scribe. But lor many years there In.-- been in
this State one monopoly, arrayed in various coiors
and antagonizing the people in all the ordinary chan

nels of business, which has been indelibly marked by
the [fish policy of Colli. P. Huntington. Whether '
il was lastened upon the nation, the State or the mu
nicipality of San Francisco and in turns or simul
taneously it has attached itself to allâ that mono] |
has sucked the life blood ot trade, commerce and
manufacture, of all the sources of prosperity, and in
us methods, through its agents and by its influe
has degraded politics and poured the virus of cor
ruption into party management.
The sinister efforts of this monopoly to absorb the
wealth of the State and to escape from its just share
of the public burdens have been openly resisted by
The Call, not exclusively, but in a conspicuous sense, j
They have never been more concentrated nor bolder
than during the past year, and especially during the
first half of i^>j. It is a cause of sincere gratifica
tion tb observe that, during thirty years of perpetual
controversy, nearly all of which was literally forced
1 AT TT 1_ â¢ 1 â¢
upon the people, Mr. Huntington has never within a
few months met with an equal number ot aeteats.
No matter what the future may have m store- for us,
whether the degenerate obsequiousness of the execu
tive may accomplish an act of treachery by the use of
the appointing power or by an extraordinary legis
f lat ive session, the exclusion of Dan Burns from the

Federal Senate through the deadlock in the joint con
â¢vention was a disastrous break in the uniformity of
the Huntington dictatorship. It was followed, more- 1
over, by other monopolistic failures, that establish a
marked improvement in our municipal service, and
that are encouraging signs as the time approaches tor
the utilization of the New Charter.
â  â  .. â  .. â 
Such a wholesale scheme of plunder as the Market
Street Railway Company originated in' March last
has rarely been concocted. It is hardly too much to
say that it amounted to a demand for the surrender to
the street railway branch of the Huntington combi
nation of all the valuable rights, franchises and privi- ]
leges San Francisco still retained, and that, too, at a
period when atranscendently great future was dawn
ing upon us. The scheme, however, planned with the
utmost care and advocated with all the subtle in- i
genuity and disregard of principle for which the rail
road monopoly is notorious, was completely beaten.
Even the surrender of Mayor Phelan did not help
the supplementary robbery that was attempted when â 
the corkscrew line had been conceded. Mr. Hunt- j
ington failed to hold the members of the Board of J
Supervisors as his chattels. !
But this is not all. For once the inviolability of
a pledge has been acknowledged, and advancing pub
lic sentiment has exacted from all the municipal offi
cers rigid adherence to the dollar limit on an assumed
valuation of $350,000,000. The Assessor, too, has
reached personal property values to the amount, of
$34,267,078. or thereabouts, which have heretofore
escaped taxation, and of this large amount eighteen
millions or more are added to the valuations of street
railway companies and other corporate monopolies.
When such indurated offenders as the Market-Street
Railway Company and the Spring Valley Water Com
pany find the valuation of their personal property
more than doubled, and have no chance to escape
their reasonable share of taxation, either by manipu-
lating politicians or by litigation, without now dis
cussing the question of equalization, it is at least
proper to record another defeat for the Huntington
â¢ -
combination, including its collateral relations and
some of its intimate friends.
The intention of the Assessors throughout the >
State, under th. advice of the Attorney General, to
include bonds of various descriptions in the personal
property valuation this year, is another step in the
right direction that is likely to produce some bene
ficial results. It may lead to the full consideration
by the Supreme Court of the meaning of our consti
tution when it provides in terms that, in this State, as;
in other States, all property of every sort, not exempt
under Federal laws, shall be taxed.
The outcome for a just and equitable enforcement !
of our system of taxation is .promising. When all !
property is brought into the light of day and none is
allowed to skulk or conceal itself, the primary basis
for just assessment, for equality before the law, is
established. The next element i- fair equalization, so
that the benefits may be equitably distributed. This
branch of the subject is now attracting general atten- j
tion and will bear further consideration. The Hunt
ington monopoly will be again in evidence before the |
tax levy is finally determined. But it now appears that
the people have some acknowledged rights that the j
municipal authorities are inclined to respect.
fIH ATTORNEY GENERAL IN FUSTIAN.
*~p^HE CALL had occasion within the last few days
Ti E comment upon some political references in
to comment upon some political references in J
* an official dispatch from Major General Otis, j
That kind of departure from military brevity and pro
priety was not wholly original. But the Attorney
General of the State of Idaho is surely entitled to the
credit of a new discovery.
It seems that, in the neighborhood of Wallace, in
Shoshone County, Idaho, for some years members
of the Miners' Union have been accustomed to decor-
I ate the graves of their dead, and to have processions
[ and speeches. Now, whether this custom originated
in some violence or breach of the law The Call does
j not -now, and for its purpose in this article does not
! care. The probability is that, as in most instances
j of antagonism between capitalists and laborers, there
was some wrong on both sides. The propriety of the
! annual celebration does not enter into the present his- j
tory. The essential point is that the Attorney Gen
eral of Idaho has assumed military functions and has
issued a proclamation -absolutely forbidding the ex
ercise' of a constitutional right, even by the wives
; and daughters of the members of the Miners' Union.
This distinguished functionary has determined that |
i the occasion of the celebration is criminal, and that '
even women shall not be permitted to pay any tribute
of respect to their unforgotten relatives, whose lives
! were at least surrendered to their conception of right.
Attorney General Sinclair is evidently a rival of
j Don Caesar de Bazan and of Bombastes Furioso. If
there is anything in the constitution or statutes of
; Idaho to invest him with the fustian dignity of a mili
tary despot, such a gross departure from the principles 1
' of American constitutional liberty should have been
I certainly pointed out. But there is no such law. In
Idaho, as in other States, when proclamations have a
; constitutional or a legislative sanction, they are issued
by the Governor. There, as everywhere else' in our j
i country, the Attorney General is simply the chief law
officer of the commonwealth.
General Merriam to a considerable extent has re
lieved himself from responsibility for the unnatural
conditions existing in Idaho. The military power of
the United States, on the assumption that the State
, was unable to deal with the situation, was properly ]
invoked to restore law and order and to insure the
' arrest of criminals. But, when this result had been :
obtained, the legitimate exercise of arbitrary author
ity#had been exhausted. The Governor, however,
acting as a partisan for the mine-owners and denying
! all the rights and privileges of citizenship to the
i miners, whether within or without the union, declared
I martial law. and a series of usurpations followed, for |
: which it will be difficult to find a precedent in I
. America s history. The story of the ''bull pen, the
â 'â¢â â  â¢
] inhumanity to an .insane man, the wholesale arrests
j without warrant of law, the imposition of illegal and
despotic rules as conditions of employment, the hard, :
coarse, brutal usage of American citizens, so fre
: quently charged, have not been, successfully contra
i dieted, and, taken together, constitute a record that I
is â graceful to the State in which it originated and
to every public official who has participated in this
manifestation of imperialism.
Nothing, however, has occurred in the neighbor
hood of Wardner so entirely incapable of _pologv or i
nation as the usurpation of Attorney General
Sinclair. His position as an exponent of the law
should have been an absolute guarantee that whatever j
other members of the State government might do he i
would stand for the rights of Ins fellow citizens in the
teeth of any imperialistic programme that might have !
been devised. But, as a matter of fact, he is the most
conscienceless of all the officials who have so readily
converted themselves into the pliant instruments of
aggressive capital, lie has ostentatiously and even 'â¢
msultinglv defied the law he is sworn to maintain.
lie has deliberately accepted a position that identi
fies him with the Lilliputians who degrade their coun
try by their substitution of a "little brief authority"
for the equality and for the dignity of the law.
Tf.MMf.NY AND BRYf-N.
WITH it- usual lack of anything like a genuine
patriotism, Tammany prepared to turn the
Fourth of July this year, as in many a year
past, to an exploitation of Democratic politics rather
than of national independence and national aspira
tion. rhis time, however, the experience of the occa
sion is not pleasing to the leaders. It turned out to
be not a rally of Democracy, but a rally of the silver I
faction and the Bryanites, and those who were ready
to set the nation aside for partisan purposes found
themselves set aside tor factional purposes.
The meeting was notable for the absence of dis- I
tinguished men, for Tammany is rich and powerful j
and has a far-reaching influence, and as a rule her i
festal days are attended by the highest dignitaries in |
the Democratic ranks. Her sachems have been care- I
ful to invite them from every section of the Union !
and from every division of the party, and in times I
past the most eminent leaders have been ready to ac- â 
cept. This year, however, her invitations went I
a-begging. No Democrat of national importance
was present. Neither Cleveland, nor Bryan, nor Hill, I
nor Olney, nor Altgeld, nor Carlisle, nor any other j
man of eminence was there, and it fell to the lot of
second or third rate men to make the orations of the
day from the Tammany platform.
At the last moment it was found that the orator '
chosen to deliver the chief speech of the occasion !
could not attend, so ex-Governor Hogg of Texas was j
called upon to fill the vacancy. The Texan soon shook I
himself free from considerations of the Fourth of July
and from regard for the politics of his Tammany'!
hosts. He launched out in a wild uproar for free I
silver and Bryan, and was greeted with a responsive
roar, It seems the conservative Democrats of the city
had remained away like the leaders, and there was \
nothing but a Bryanite rabble in the hall. Hogg's I
speech was an immense hit. We are told it was an
swered with cheer after cheer of enthusiastic ap
plause.
The incident is the more significant because it is
well known the Tammany leaders have been for some'
time past seeking to find a means of eliminating
the silver question and beating Bryan for the nomi
nation in- 1900. It has been believed, moreover, that
progress has been made in effecting a combination to
that end. It now appears the Tammany organizers
have found difficulties in their way which the public
has not perceived. Why should Hill and Murphy
have been absent from the celebration? Why did not.
Gorman or Olney take advantage of the occasion to
furnish conservative Democracy with a new platform
and a new programme?
It seems evident the conservative wing of the Dem- !
ocratic party is hopelessly demoralized. It plans and j
plots and organizes, but never succeeds in making
a successful demonstration of strength in public. The
famous ten-dollar banquet on Jackson day was a
failure. The Bryanites by holding a dollar dinner I
drew the crowd, and, what was more to the point, they
declared a definite policy of action, while the Tam
many men showed themselves weak and undeter
mined. The silver demonstration on the Fourth of
July completes the defeat of the Tammany men.
They have a year in which to recover themselves and

reorganize for the fight in the Presidential conven
tion, but if they expect to profit by it they must find
a strong, resolute leader to direct them. Under their
present leadership Bryan beats them at every turn.
A DISPATCH from General Otis, dated July 4,
notifies the President that the California infan
try and artillery will embark upon the Sher
man to return home. The transport was loading at
Negros at the time the dispatch was sent, but it was
added, "It is difficult to lighter transports during the
typhoon now prevailing," so there may be a day or
two of delay in the embarkation. In any event, how
ever, the Californians have closed their service in the
Philippines and ere long will be at home to receive
the welcome and the plaudits that await them.
Not all of those who marched away so bravely will
return. Battle and disease have thinned the ranks, and
in some homes there will be mourning while the State
at large rejoices.- The mourners, however, will not be
without consolation, for death is the heritage of the
race, and their loved ones have met it in the manner
which in all lands and in all ages has been ever re
garded as the most honorable. They have died for
their country and beneath its flag, and all that pa
triotic love and honor can give will be bestowed upon
their memory.
Fortunately the missing from the ranks will be
comparatively few. The regiment will return flushed :
with the honorable pride born of the consciousness of
a noble duty nobly done, and will find among their
friends and their acquaintances a true appreciation of
the difficulty of their service and its value to the re
public.
The campaign in the Philippines has been no holi. j
day task. Tropic islands, with their palms and pines, I
their sunny days and ' starry nights, their gorgeous j
flowers and luscious fruits, are beautiful in poetry and
romance, but to the man accustomed to the bracing
atmosphere of the temperate zone they are depress- j
ing. pestilential and dangerous. The air may be per- )
fumed with flowers, but it is laden with noxious va- j
pors, and from the waters of the still lagoons and the j
soil of the jungles alike there arise exhalations laden I
with slow death to whoever is not acclimated to them '
from childhood.
It is not possible to forecast with accuracy the voy- {
age of a transport ship across the wide sweep of the ;
Pacific, and consequently it is not certain on what ,
day the returning volunteers may be expected to ar- j
rive. In all probability about thirty days will be re- ;
quired for the voyage. In that time ample arrange
ments should be made to give the boys a welcome
that will show how true 'to them the hearts at home
have been during their service abroad. The recep
tion is to take place in this city, but men and women
from all parts of California should share in it. There
was a spontaneous outburst of popular enthusiasm
and pride when they sailed away, and now let the
welcome home be more ardent still.
CONDITIONS OF EASTERN FARMERS.
FARMERS of the Eastern States are making to
the Industrial Commission much more satisfac
tory statements than did the - planters of the
South. They have a larger capital to the acre under
cultivation, a better class of labor and larger home
markets, and by reason of such advantages carry on a
more diversified industry. Thus it comes about that
while the Southern planter complains of hard times
the Eastern granger seems fairly well content with his
conditions.
A summary recently given in the New York Her
ald of the testimony of New Jersey farmers before the
commission makes a remarkably good showing for
the rural industries of that State, notwithstanding the j
iact that the prices of farm products are less
than in former years, and labor costs more. A scien
tific treatment of -the soil has increased its produc- j
tiveness and better methods of farming have increased I
the output, so that while the development of railway
transportation has brought the West and the South
into competition with the farmers of New Jersey, the
latter are still able to make a comfortable living with
less work than was required to attain less of comfort
forty years ago.
According to the testimony the farmers of that por- '
tion of the country have good houses, horses, car
riages and farm buildings. They have pianos and
organs in their homes, and the opportunities for so
cial and intellectual enjoyment are far superior to
what they were in the last generation. Nor is it the
farmer only who has benefited by recent changes.
The farm laborer has profited as well as his employer,
and it was noted that throughout the State there is j
a general tendency to shorten the hours of the work
ing day on farms as well as to increase the pay.
On one point, however, the farmers agreed in com- |
plaint. They assert with positiveness that the qual
ity of farm labor has declined since they were boys. !
The young men of the rural districts do not remain to j
work on the farms, as was the custom of the former
generation. They go to the cities or to the West, and I
the farmer has to content himself with a much lower
class of workers than was at the service of his pre- ;
decessor before the war.
A complaint of that nature is not surprising. From ;
the beginning of the age of civilization that brought
about between men the relation of employed and em
ployer there has been dissatisfaction on one side or
the other. The servant girl problem perplexes the
housekeepers of every land and every age. and the
farm boy problem harasses the farmer. Despite the
complaints now made of farm labor it is quite prob- j
able that it is equal to if not positively better than it |
was a generation ago. At any rate, if the farmers of ;
the East have no other complaint to make than that j
of employes, they are not worse off than the people of
the cities.
While Los Angeles entertains. the educators of the
nation, San Francisco welcomes the agricultural ex
perts, and the situation is perfectly proper â we need
to learn something about rural industry and Los An
geles is in need of book-learning.
It's pretty near time that the Reichstag Jet go its
attacks on the American hog and pay some attention
to the German canine. Nineteen families at Ingbert,
in one of the Rhine provinces, were poisoned re
cently from eating sausages.
From the record thus far made by the Columbia it
appears we might as well begin to celebrate the com
ing victory over the Irish challengerâ Shamrock
is virtually ours.
Senator Jones of Nevada, although not a racing
authority, says that the odds are sixteen to one that
the Democratic slogan for iooo will be "Bryan and
Silver!"
Two fatalities are reported in all the United States
as a result of the last Fourth of July celebration.
That's nearly as cheap as a Filipino victory.

He Will State All the Leading Facts,
but Will Make No Recommen
dations Whatever in the
Matter.
â â â â
' United States Attorney Coombs pre
pared yesterday a statement to the At
torney General on the Welburn case for
the Information of the Department of
Justice. He simply recites the facts of
the two trials of Welburn, his acquittal
on the first trial, the disagreement of
the jury* on the second trial and the fact
that eight of the jurors on the second
trial were for acquittal. He also gives
his opinion to the Attorney General as
to the causes which have operated in
Welburn's favor, notwithstanding the
strong case made against him by the Gov
ernment; but he makes no recommenda
tion as to the future disposition of the
case.
Said Mr. Coombs yesterday: "I am re
porting all the incidents of the trial un
der a former administration of this office
and of the second trial conducted by my
self because it is a matter of considera
ble magnitude; and I desire the depart
ment to have a full realization, as far
as I can give it, of all the issues and side
issues connected with it. But I am not
making any recommendations."
' It is reported that the friends of "vv el
burn are making representations to the
Revenue Department and to the Depart
ment of Justice to the effect that it will
be impossible to secure his conviction, the
case on the second trial having been pre
sented as strongly as possible on behalf
of the Government; and thai no stronger
case can be made out. They allege that
the sentiment of the community is in
sympathy with the accused, and suggest
tliat he has been sufficiently punished by
being made an outcast and by the dis
grace brought upon him by the charges
made against him.
IN THE GAY WORLD
OF THE
"BEGGAR STUDENT"
THE Beggar Student" at the 'Grand

and well acted. I say "acted" be
cause there are not wanting the cu
rious who. being met at the door with
dialogue and kept hobnobbing with it
through the better part of the evening,
wonder what is to be the ultimate evolu
tion of the opera part of comic opera.
So much conversation not too distinctly
articulated keeps the tympanum on a
stretch and makes one repeat the homely
saw that "when people undertake to sell
you milk, it is milk they want and noth
ing else." Don't mistake me. The even
ing's entertainment is a good one. This
is conclusively shown in the well filled
houses and generous applause, but I do
find the unnecessary conversation a bore.
The composer has not handicapped him.
self frith any heavy plot. You find your
self merrily and pleasantly overlooking
the ings of a set of people whose wide
departure from the established ways of
living lifts you well out of the humdrum
of daily existence. There Is no eight
hour labor problem with them; no years
of fashionable flirtation fore marriage;
no sorrows that stay long enough to try
the soul. Their morality takes the unique
stand that if you can't even pay for
bread you are about to order at the tav
ern, why not call for champagne and
birds and "hang the expense"; they de
cline to have a band in any of the real
business of life and you know they would
have only to turn on their heel to be
come President. The music, when it hap
pens, is melodious and well rendered. The
role of the stud. is a grateful one for
Mr. Persse, and he holds the sympathy
of his audience without interruption. His
solo in the third act Is conspicuous for
the beauty of ids covered head tones, but
in the duets, to my regret, he oversings
Miro Delamotta. whose notes one cannot
afford to lose. When Mr. Wolff plays the
part of an officer, either foreign or na
tive, past century or up to date, some
thing- in the uniform casts a spell over
him and he is "the same yesterday, to
day and forever." It is worth while not-
Ing this. because he is a versatile, capa
ble actor, and does not need to fall into
such an error. Miss Mason -sings with so
easy a method and has such a natural
way of sitting down occasionally on a
comfortable sofa and telling you her joys
and sorrows without gesture that you
never feel uneasy in her presence. Miss
Thorn appears upon the scene for all the
world like "Puss in Boots," and becomes
to her family what he became to his mas
ter, matchmaker and general fortune
promoter. There is a beautiful flow of
color in the costuming, a touch of nat
uralness in the movement on the tavern
balcony, but too much facing the audi
ence in the ensemble grouping, except at
the end of the second act, where they
sing the old familiar waltz movement.
Here they are beautifully placed. The
drill to Sousa's "Stars and Stripes" made
a patriotic and graceful climax and won
a round of applause. -".
A fine production of "Carmen" is prom
ised next week, and this consoles one for
the frugal diet of a single song Miss Ladd

poop and ghoulish contributor who pre
tends to | give a sensational write-up in
regard to ex-Treasurer William Jackson
and his son, recently slain in battle in
the Philippine war. As a sample of the
rotten statement made in the article,
which is illustrated by alleged photo
fraphs, the scribbler speaks of the elder
acKson as a "survivor of the Civil War,"
who "lost an arm and gained a record
for splendid service in a company that
went into Dixie from the North." and as
a "Grand Army veteran who had been
disabled while fighting for the flag." The
fact is that Jackson never put on a mili
tary uniform in his life, never enlisted in
the Government service, was not outside
of Shasta County during the rebellion,
and he lost his arm through the ac
cidental discharge of a gun, which neces
sitated amputation, years after the cruel
war was overâShasta Courier.
Trje Nun of Kenmare.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cai.. July 3. 1899.
Editor of- the Callâ Dear Sir: In your
notice on June 8 of the death of Miss Cu
sack, known as the "Nun of Kenmare,"
It is stated that "Some years ago she left
the Catholic church and sent a public res
ignation to Pope Leo XIII: later she. was
reconciled and died in the faith of the
Catholic church." As you have evidently
been misinformed, and in the interest of
truth, I should be much obliged if you
would publish the following facts: Al
though It Is quite true that Miss Cusaek
left the Roman communion, she was
never reconciled to that faith, and was
attended during her last illness by the
Rev. J. G. Gregory; the evangelical and
Protestant Incumbent of Christ Church,
Leamington. Her funeral took place at
the Protestant cemetery in Leamington,
and the service was conducted by the
Rev. G. E. A. Pargiter (vicar of St.
Paul's^ and the Rev. J. G. Gregory. Yours"
truly, ' T. W. COWAN.
Patriotic Offenders.
The patriots arrested Tuesday for fir
ing off revolvers appeared in the Police
Courts yesterday, and as a rule the
Judges were lenient and discharged them,
as they had only been firing blank cart
ridges. Those who were convicted will
be sentenced this morning. Charles Gun
ter was foolish enough . to .tell Judge
wn that he would not sell his r Â«J2 iV t %
but would shoot ducks with it ana tne
Judge convicted him.. The police seized
altogether over 100 revolvers and two
brass cannon.

CONTRACTOR DAVID R. PERRY'S
SCALP OPENED.
â¢
The Two Men Had Not Been on
Friendly Terms for Years and
Perry Was Wanted on
Bench Warrants.
Policeman David W. Boyd, who is at
tached to the Boys' and Girls' Aid Society,
will probably have to appear before the
Police Commissioners for his conduct to
ward David R. Perry, the contractor and
builder, while arresting him yesterday
afternoon at Larkin and McAllister
streets. At least ten witnesses will come
forward and testify that Boyd used Perry
in a brutal and cowardly manner.
Perry failed to appear in Judge Mogan'a
court yesterday morning when his name
was called to answer the charges of dis
turbing the peace and exhibiting a deadly
weapon at a restaurant on Stockton street
on Tuesday morning. He had been re
leased on his own recognizance by Judge
Treadwell. Judge Mogan issued bench,
warrants for his arrest and made an or
der that no bail should be accepted.
Boyd knows Perry well, as he claims
that Perry built a house for him some
years ago and considerably overcharge*!
him for extras. Since then Boyd has not
been friendly disposed toward Perry, we
knew that Perry was arrested on Tuesday
morning, also that he failed to appear
yesterday morning and bench warrants
were out for his arrest. .
Perry was at the southwest corner or
Larkin and McAllister streets yesterday
afternoon, when Boyd saw him. Boyd
promptly grabbed him and, pulling ms
revolver out of his pocket, struck Perry
on the head with it. knocking him down.
He pulled him up and continued to strike
him on the head with the revolver till
some bystanders interfered and further
brutality was stopped.
Perry, with the blood running down his
face and neck, was taken to the City
Prison, and, after being booked, was sent
to the Receiving Hospital, where two
wounds in his scalp were stitched and
dressed. He had also several abrasions on
his scalp. He was then locked up in the
P Boyd said that when he grabbed hold of
Perry he made for him and he pulled out
his handcuffs to defend himself, as Perry
was crazy and might have had a gun. as
he had the previous morning. He simply
hit him on the head with the handcuffs
to keep him in subjection. Later Boyd ad
mitted that he did not use the handcuffs
but his revolver. .*- :.'.
Ed Smoot, the saloon-keeper on the cor
ner went to the hospital to see how Perry
had fared. He was indignant at the treat
ment to which Perry had been subjected.
"If the officer had been arresting an ox,
he said "instead of a human being he
could not have acted in a more brutal
manner. I did not see the beginning of
the fight, but I saw Boyd pull Perry up
from the ground and smash him on the
head with the revolver. All the time Per
ry had his hands up. crying, 'Don't strike
me; I'll goâ l'll go.' It was an outrage,
and ten reputable business men who saw
it came into my saloon and left me their
names and addresses, saying they would
willingly come forward and testify against
the officer." â¢ '
Perry denied that he offered any resist
ance All that he did was to wheel around
to see who had grabbed him by the shoul
der, and Boyd commenced to use his re
volver. "I had reasons," said Perry, "for
not being in court this morning, and
called to see my attorney, Archie Camp
bell, about it. He was not in, and I had
reached the corner when Boyd grabbed
me."
Two Buildings Burned.
Ten minutes before noon yesterday a
fire broke out in the premises at No. 2137
and 2139 Jones street, and involved the
adjoining building, No. 2140 Jones street,
occupied by Mrs. Bridget Manning. It
was an hour before the fire department
was able to subdue the flames owing to
the inflammable nature of the buildings.
The damage is estimated at $3000. The
buildings are the property of the Burke
estate and R. Magner.
On the previous evening Cornelius Man

'Ural i u_d Experiment Sta
-1 tions began yesterday morning in the
" Academy of Sciences hall. The meet
ing was called to order shortly before
10 o'clock by President Henry P. Armsby
of Pennsylvania. Mayor Phelan occupied
a seat upon the rostrum to the right of
the president, while upon his left was
Henry H. Goodell of Massachusetts, chair
man of the executive committee. Presi
dent Armsby annouhcsed that the conven
tion would be formally opened with
prayer, which was offered by Second Vice
President Charles S. Murkland of New-
Hampshire. Before any business was con
sidered the president Introduced Mayor
Phelan, who upon the part of the State
and the city of San Francisco welcomed
the members of the convention.
He said: "Gentlemen of the Association
of American Agricultural Colleges and Ex
periment Stations: We of San Francisco
are pleased to welcome you. We know
!that San Francisco is far remote from the
great educational centers, and there
fore we feel the compliment paid to us
by your association coming such a great
distance for the purpose of holding its
deliberations. A programme has been ar
ranged by which you are to be shown our
State. You are to be taken through the
Sar.ta Clara, Santa Rosa, San Joaquin and
Sacramento valleys. You will see our min
ing, grain and horticultural interests. I
know what your judgment will mean to
the State, and we invite it in the interest
of the State. I trust that your sojourn
here will be a pleasant one, and I heartily
wc-U-ome you to San Francisco."
President Armsby responded. He said
that the members of the association were
deeply grateful to the Mayor for his wel
come. "We. have heard much,' continued
he, "of California, the empire State of the
West and we anticipate with pleasure
our inspection of it. We accept your wel
come in our representative capacity, for
we have come to see and examine your
resources, of which we have heard so
much. What little we have seen of the
State has been far beyond our expecta
tions :! nd 1 can assure you that we shall
make known throughout the country the
tilings that we find here." . v ,
At the conclusion of President Armsby _
response First Vice President Joseph E.
Stubbs of Nevada, moved that Mayor _ he
lan be elected an honorary member ot the

announced that Elwood Mead, an expert
in charge of the irrigation, research in
the office of experiment stations in \\ as.i

The reports were ail limited to twenty
minutes. The section on botany and
horticulture, of which Professor Louis li.
Pammei of low-a is chairman, did not re
port because he was suffering from such
a severe cold that he did not feel able to
read his paper, and he begged the indul
gence of the convention, and was allowed
a continuance. There was no report from
the section of college work. President
Charles S. Murkland. chairman of the
section of mechanic arts, made a brief
but very* interesting report, in which he
gave some idea of the importance of the
student work to the association, and he
also discussed the best methods of cur
ing this work from thÂ« student. Several
of the minor committees were not ready
to report.

"The Electrical Engineering Laboratory
In Its Relation to Local Engineering
Work" was the subject of an extensive
paper by Mr. Cory. He said in substance
that the college laboratory should be more

so as to keep it in touch with this work.
The section of agriculture and chemistry
met at 2 o'clock in the Mills building, J.

JAMES WILSON,
Secretary of Agriculture.
President Armsby made the report for
the committee on collective station ex
hibit at the Paris Exposition. He stated
that definite space had been secured for
the exhibit and that active correspondence
had been begun with the various stations
with a view to obtaining contributions,
and that the committee was already as
sured of a creditable exhibit. The exhibit
is to be an exhibit by the experiment
statiÂ»is only and not by the colleges. The
exhibit is to be collective and of a techni
cal character, and will be prepared at the
cost of the individual stations.
M. E. Jaffa announced the various ex
cursions that are to be taken by the del-s
--gates of the association next week. On
Saturday the park and Cliff House will
be visited, while in the evening the dele
gates will go to Berkeley. Monday Ukiah
will be visited; Tuesday, Fresno; Thurs
day, Orrville. The delegates will come
back to San Francisco on Thursday night.
Friday Santa Clara Valley will be visited.
President Armsby, being introduced by
Mr. Stubbs, delivered his annual address.
He directed the attention of the associa
tion solely to the aspects of the experiment
stations, and then proceeded to eulogize
the memory of Senator Justin S. Morrill,
who he said was the author of the or
ganic, act, which guarantee,! "the liberal
and practical education of the industrial
classes." Next he dwelt upon the system
of Agricultural Experiment Station-*,
which now extends over the whole civil
ized world, and said that it was traceable
to the influence exerted by the writings
and investigations of Liebig. Hi? work,
he said, marked the epoch In the history
of agriculture. President Ar.nsby said
there are 500" experiment stations at pres
ent distributed throughout forty countries
and colonies.
The inception of the stations, he s.iid,
was to teach by a practical study of ex
periments the ' indispensable principles
that are necessary' to a profitable appli
cation of agriculture, and to give the
student an ability to apply the principles.
"The Hatch bill." continued the speaker,
"as passed In 1887. was the beginning of
the new era upon which the experiment
stations entered at that time. Up to that
time the independent institutions had oc
cupied toward the farmer the same posi
tion that an expert chemist does toward
the manufacturer." From this it was evi
dent that President Armsby .-!â¢â¢â .â  the
inference that at one time the stations
were not always honest In their work
"In brief." he said, "the real problem
of the station is not to put a mass of In
formation, however valuable, into the
hands of the, farmer, but to strengthen
his prrasp coon principles and his ability
to annlv hem. "
The conclusion of the address was an
exploitation of the fundamental rules of
an agricultural education. -
President R. C Kedzie of th.-- Agricul
tural College of Michigan followed Presi
dent Armsby and delivered the annual ad
dress to the association of official agri
cultural chemists. His address was a
purely technical one in point of
detail, dealing. as it did. with
chemical inventions and the gen
eral advances made by the science of
chemistry. He dwelt upon the exposures
of food adulterations as made by chemists,
and said the association had done a noble
work in this line.

CHEMISTS, San Francisco.
C, announced that President Kedzie
would deliver his address at the Occi
dental Hotel this morning in response to
on invitation extended by the Agri
cultural Colleges Convention
Mr. Wiley then read a historical paper,
in which he spoke of the origin and de
velopment of the Association of Official
Agricultural Chemists, which was the
first of its kind in the world and has been
In existence nineteen years.
"Germany and some other European
countries,", he said, "have followed the
example of America and established sim
ilar associations, which have been pro
ductive of much good. The association
had exerted a great influence in the de
velopment of agricultural science in the
United States. The conditions of research
in agricultural chemistry at the present
time show a remarkable progress as com
pared with those existing twenty years
ago. The methods established by the asso
ciation are acknowledged as ofllcial and
standards not only in our country, but
have been adopted by chemists in foreign
countries."
E. G. Runvan read his report on
"Phosphoric Acid" and was followed by-
Mr. Wiley, who read a paper on "Potash"
compiled by B. B. Ross, who is absent.
B. W. Kilgore and M. A. Soovell took

NATIONAL EDITORIAL
ASSOCIATION CONVENES
In His Annual Address President
MacCabe Tells How Journalists
Are Handicapped.
PORTLAND. Or., July The four
teenth annual convention of the National
Editorial Association met at 11 o'clock
this morning at the Marquam Grand The
ater. Governor T. T. Geer and Mayor
H. A. Storey welcomed the delegates In
behalf of the State of Oregon and the city
of Portland. Harvey W. Scott, editor of
the Oregonian, spoke at length.
President MacCabe, in his annual ad
dress, said:
"1 will hazard the opinion that no pro
fession or business in this broad land Of
ours is so handicapped with unjust laws
as is that of the journalist. I therefore
commend to your earnest attention the
report of the committee on libel law,
and hope that this convention will, as a
result of said deliberation, crystallize and
formulate some practical line of work to
the .--nd that a more equitable adjustment
of the law of libel may be recorded
throughout the Union."
Speaking of some of the annoyances to
which newspaper publishers are subject
ed, he said:
"A rapidly growing evil which news
papers must face oner or later is the
so-called 'advertising programme' nui
sance. Already the business men are com
mencing to protest at this semi-respect
able blackmail, and well they may. A
paper has been prepared especially on this
topic, and I hope will arouse you to that
sense, of duty which you owe the business
community, if not yourself."

Conley.
Several ladies were in Judge Mn_*an's
court yesterday to testify against Frank
Conley, a teamster for the Western De
livery Company, charged with cruelty to
a horse he was driving on Pacific street,
near Jones. Mrs. Clara Foltz appeared
as special prosecutor.
Mrs. S. H. Whiting, wife of the general
manager of the California Northwestern
Railroad, testified that she saw Conley
strike the horse with a whip, and when
she proved him he told her it was none
Of her business. She showed him her
badge as a member of the Society for
the Prevention Of Cruelty to Animals, and
asked him if he would not respect it, and
he said he would not. Mrs. C. B. Hol
brook, wife of the secretary of the so
ciety and promoter of the Bands of
Mercy, corroborated Mrs. Whiting. -
Conley testified that th.- horse was a colt
and was in the habit of running on the
sidewalk. He tapped ft twice with a short
whip while going up the hill and the la
dies came and spoke to him about it.
There were no marks on the colt, and in
this he was corroborated by Dan Mariana,
a driver for the United States Laundry
Company. The Judge "-aid he would give
his decision Saturday.

a hand on her throat. He struck Clif
ford with his disengaged fist and Cliffoid

Special Dispatch to ThÂ© Call.
LOS ANGELES', July s.â The school
ma'ams of the nation are headed for Los
Angeles, 15,000 strong. Tills information
Is based on the reports that from time to
time have been received at local National
Educational Association headquarters and
that are now confirmed by Dr. Irwin
Shepard, the general secretary of the
National Educational Association.
Up to the present the influx of teachers
has been greater for ante-convention
dates than at any previous period in the
history of teachers' national conventions.
It was too much to expect that the teach
ers would leave before July 4, as the pub
lic Bchools in many States close In the
last days of June. It Is apparent that
July 5 has been chosen for general de
partures from the East.
Among the prominent educators that
will on Saturday morning arrive are Dr.
William T. Harris, United States Com
missioner of Education at Washington,
D.C., and family; Eliphalet Oram Lyte of
Millersville. Pa., the president of the Na
tional Education Association, and family;
I. C. McNeil of Superior, Wis., the treas
urer of .the National Education Associa
tion, and wife; Dr. Nicholas- Murray But
ler of Columbia University, New York
City, and Dr. Louis Selden, superinten
dent of the public schools of St. Louis.
This party will on Sunday be followed by
the Skidmore and Phillips parties from
New York, New Jersey, Washington" and
Philadelphia,
Professor Frank A. Fitzpatrick, an old
educator and who attends the annual ses
sions of the National Educational Asso
ciation, no matter where held, arrived
from Boston this morning. Mr. Fitzpat
rick. will have charge of the American
Book Concern's exhibit.
Teachers and many others are now ar
riving here at the rate of about 400 a day,
and the number of visitors will grow dally
until the first day of the convention.
The Southern Pacific south-bound train,
due at 1:20 this afternoon, was nearly four
hours late, the result of a wait at Tracy
for the i Â»gden express, which was to bring
to Los Angeles three Pullman palace cars
and as many tourist sleepers, all rilled to
overflowing with National Educational
Association guests and their friends. The
Southern Pacific will, on Friday morn
ing, bring in six Cullman**, carrying teach
ers and others from Tucson and Phoenix.
The train Is due at the Arcade about 9:30
a. m. on July 7.
To-morrow's Santa Fe overland will
bring 119 passengers, who are being
brought here in two sections. The first
train carries forty-two passengers for this
city and the second seventy-seven pas
sengers.
Forty-five teachers west bound spent
July 4 in the Grand Canyon. A party of
twenty-five went into the canyon to-day.
The Santa Fe's passenger list from the
East to-day numbered ISO, who came in
two sections.
The. city of Cincinnati is after next
year's National Educational Association
convention, and with an energy which,
unless headed off by some of the other
competitors for the distinction, bids fair
to capture the prize.

LOCAL TEACHERS TO ATTEND.
Will Keep "Open House at the Los
Angeles Convention.
The San Francisco school department
will be well represented at the national
convention of teachers, to be held in Los
Angeles. Fully 300 certificates have he-
sold and between 200 and 300 teachers will
be in attendance. Headquarters have been
secured for the local teachers, where
Eastern visitors will be hospitably enter
tained, the Board of Education having
appropriated $100 for the purpose and the
teachers themselves having subscribed
$100 additional. It was the intention to
make a display from the Polytechnic
School that would have been without
doubt the finest in the country, but as it
would cost at least $500 the board decided
that the condition of the finances would
not permit of it. A fine exhibition of
drawing from the various schoojs will be
made, however. School Superintendent
R. H. Webster is on the programme to
address the convention, which recognition
is quite an honor for San Francisco.
MINNIE ADAMS' CASK
The prosecution in the case of Mrs Mm- ;
nic Adams, charged with # the murder of
her 'nfant son, John Richard Gray, is
again beginning to lag. The cross-exami
nation of George R. Purltnky, the drug
clerk, who Is said to have sold Mrs.
Adams the bottle of poison the night be
fore the alleged murder, developed the I
fact that his identification of Mrs. Adams
was weak. He thought that the prisoner
looked like the woman who bought the .
poison, but he would not be positive in
his identification. Police Sergeant Duke,
Fred Denhard and H. W. Gautner also
testified during the day, but added no j
link to the chain of circumstantial evi
dence. It is thought that the prosecution
will clcso to-day and to-morrow the de- ]
fense will have its inning. , ; > ,
Charter Test Case.
This morning Judge Seawell will hear
the pleas of counsel to set the date for
the hearing of the action of Martin Frag
ley. Superintendent of Streets, against the
Board of Election Commissioners, brought

Beawell was not on- the bench yesterday

POLICE COMMISSIONERS
VISIT THE NYMPHIA
THEY THOROUGHLY INSPECT
THE NOTORIOUS PLACE.
Chief of Police Lees Guides the Mem
bers of the Board Through the
Hotel of Vice Action to
Be Taken.
Police Oommisioners Alvord and Tobin.
accompanied by Chief of Police Lees,
visited the Hotel Nymphia last evening
and narrowly inspected the place. The
visit was In lieu of the regular weekly
meeting of the board and has much sig
nificance, as the complaints of the prop
erty owners and residents In the vicinity
of the spot have been filed with many of
the municipal departments of the city.
The trio met by appointment in the
rooms of the Commissioners about 7:30
p. m., and were from there conveyed to
the Nymphia in a carriage. So as not to
cause any excitement or fear in the hearts
of the Nymphia' visitors, the jehu was
ordered to stop a block away and the
Commissioners and their guide proceeded
to the hotel on foot. Arriving inside, the
Chief Inquired for the woman tn charge
and had her pilot them, through.- the en
tire building. Chief Lees did the entire
questioning the Commissioners listening
to the explanation as to how the place
was carried on, the number of women who
infest Its precincts' and other matters di
rectly bearing on the subject. Chief Lees
.was desirous of knowing whether there
would be an entrance on Stockton street
and was Informed that such a plan would
not be adopted. After thoroughly Inspect
ing the Nymphia the Commissioners and
the Chief departed.
Special attention was given by the visit
ors to that portion of the building that
is near Stockton street and which is now
unused because of the determined fight
of the residents of the North Beach dis
trict. The projectors of the Nymphia
scheme are determined to open the closed
section of the brick building. They are
bringing to bear every reason and influence
to achieve victory, while Father Caraher.
Rev. Dr. ITrray and other leaders in the
fight against the vice spot are determined
that the whole thing shall be abolished.
Their continued complaints to the Police
Department have been taken into consid
eration by the Board of Police Commis
sioners, who have satisfied themselves as
to whether it Is a nuisance or detrimental
to the nothern portion of the city.
The Commissioners will in all proba
bility invite the defenders and objectors
to the Nymphia before them next
Wednesday night, when, they will take
action in the matter.

TI-E LUMBER TRADE.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says: "As cv- ;
cry month passes in the pre- year the *-'â¢''
ation common through, it the lumber trade
circles of this State and the coast in general
becomes more satisfactory. The manufactur
ers of redwood, pine, spruce and fir. ' ether
with those engaged ln the shingle business,
report excellent conditions and a plentltude
of orders; in fact, altogether too many and
too frequent to be filled in the ordinary ten |
hours dally run. 1
The deliveries at San Francisco of pine, |
spruce and fir for May were 2.561.433 feet in ex
cess of those for the last month, while the
redwood receipts from Mendocino, Del Norte :
and Humboldt counties were 2.134 05^ feet more
fn May than in June, but the shingle receipts
for June table a visible increase of U16.6W
over Mai These figures do not denote a fall-
Ing away of the .local lumber business since
the prices current for June furnished the dif
ference incurred by the decrease â â â 'â  deliveries. j
The hardwood lines show a good monthtor
June with every prospect pf a most satt-rhc - j
tory thirty days to tollow. The dealers hold
well together and all indications point to a
good season's business.
Shingles are steady, with prices firm and
deliveries frequent and large to Santa Ana.
and San Francisco The year 1899 will be the
strongest In the history of the California in- j
dustry. '-"_',"_ , v.
The Pacific Ocean export trade is flourish
ing and shipments are large at remunerative
prices Freight rates are un the advance, but j
the lumber manufacturers are equal to the oc
caslon. China, Japan and Hawaii repeated ;
their May orders ast month and. all in ail,
the lumber business of California, Oregon and
Washington with Arizona and the Eastern
States has not been on so encouraging a scale .
since the 'good times' of IS9I and formerly. A
little more co-operation on the part of dealers
and manufacturers might work even better re
suits." -

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July s.â The market for stocks i
continued notably strong to-day and much more
_ live than the upward movement of last week.
The activity was very widely distributed, ex- j
tending pretty generally throughout the list,
and during the course of the day extending even |
to some of the cats and dogs on the list. The
general strength of the market was maintained
in face of a realizing movement in the stocks
that were most conspicuous in last week's rise,
notably Pennsylvania, New York Central and !
the Vanderbilt group generally. Including
"Northwestern, Omaha and the Union Pacific
stocks. There was no very heavy pressure of
liquidation in these stocks, but there was no
effort to hold up their prices and a number of
them show losses of a point or over. There
was a realizing movement in the grangers also,
but vigorous strength of St. Paul sustained
this group and brought new buying through
commissi houses. St. Paul's extraordinary
gain in earnings for the fourth week In June
of about $3-0,0 over the corresponding week
of last year was the main motive for this buy
ing, though the general outlook in the wheat
market induced a. general covering of shorts.
The line of shorts put out in the grangers on
the early belief in the ruin of the wheat crop
is understood to have been very large, and no
small part of the present strength of the
grangers Is attributed to covering of these
ehorts. Atchison preferred was very' markedly
affected in the same way and rose to 60%. The
bears, who had sold Brooklyn in expectation of
a Fourth of July strike, were eager buyers to
cover short contracts md advanced the stock
at one tin:-' nearly 4 points. The rise in Sugar
extended to nearly 5 points. Other specialties
which rose strongly were the Tobacco stocks,
Steel and Wire. Tennessee Coal. People's Gas,
international Paper and Anaconda. It is now
admitted that the recent gold exports have
been directly due to borrowing for the purpose
of easing the German money market,- which
was in urgent need of it to carry over the
half-yearly period. Discounts in foreign mar
kets were easy -day.
Bond: were active and prices advanced a
fraction. Total sales, par value. $3,390,000.
United States old 4's registered advanced %
in the bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day amounted to
637,748 shares, including: American Steel and
Wire, 26.500; American Sugar Refining, 8300;

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. July s.â The Commercial Ad- I
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: I
The markets here were steady and quiet to- j
day with Americans the leading feature. The
market, however. was narrow though firm
until New York prices were received, where
upon it became buoyant and the close was at
the best. Briskness was confined to a few j
stocks. St. Paul. Union Pacific, Northern Pa
cific common. Southern and Atchison pre
ferred. The feeling here is that stocks may :
be high, enough, but the glut of dividends In '
the United States is so great owing to the
purchase of European holders that the invest
ment pressure, it Is believed, may go much ]
further. Tintos were 16%; Anacondas, 11 9-1 ; j
Utahs, 94; Bostons, 1%.

CHICAGO WHEAT MARKET.
CHICAGO, July âWheat opened with a
loss of %c compared with the close of last
, Saturday. All the early information was
against higher prices. The English visible
supply, which a year ago showed a decrease of
296.0C0 bushels, to-day showed an incsease of
1,358,000 bushels. Shipments from India to
European markets astonished even the bears.
They were reported at 2,000,000 bushels, mak
ing a total from all points to Europe, 8.193.000
: bushels. Spot wheat., which opened with sales
from 75c down to 74%. showed no tendency to

ures, however, started a second decline, Sep
i tember touching 73% c. The market showed no
signs whatever of rallying and closed at 73% _
73% c for September, a net loss of _%c.
I Corn rule.d heavy in sympathy with wheat.

making its total distance 207 feet from the sta
tion. The face Is in porphyry with streaks of
quartz. In the south drltt, at a point opposite
the north drift, we have cut out a, station to
sink a winze. This winze will prospect the
downward extension of the ore body found on
the 370-foot level. We will commence sinking
on the sth Inst., all work in the mine having

terday: "Since the last weekly report was writ
ten we have been able to reach the ISOO-foot
level. The station on this level Is In fair condi
tion and the drift south of the winze Is open
for some distance There is, however, a great
deal of debris off the level, and it will take a
few days' work to show its exact condition.
We find a little water on the level, and for the
purpose of handling It we have put ln a small
pump. When the shift came off this morning
the water had been all drained out. There Is a
little water coming into this level, the source
of which I have not been able to locate, but
we will be able to care for it without any
trouble with cur present arrangements. The
air hoist and pipe line are In good condition,
and everything is on hand for the rapid re
opening of the 1800-foot level. The work will
be pushed as fast as possible. Work in the
stope of the 1750-foot level Is being continued.
All work has been suspended from 7 a. m. of
the 4th of July to 7 a. m. of the Sth."

POS Broadway. July 5.
Mrs. Frances Dugan. a pretty,'unassum
ing widow of CS, residing with her aged
mother at 273 Ninth street, has demon
strated her ability to defend herself .with
th.- aid of. a club, against the obnoxious
attentions of a jilted lover twice iter
The petite widow created an exciting
scene on Ninth str.-et. between Broad
way and Franklin, last night by wield
ing a club on W. A. McNaughton with
telling eftect. M ghton had ap
proached her at the corner, of Broadway
and Ninth street while she "as on her
way home from a shopping tour, and
stated that he desired to speak with her.
Mrs. Dug.in vigorously declined to be In
terviewed, advising McNaughton not to
molest her. He persisted, however, in
forcing hts attentions upon; her. when she
rushed into the street and picking up a
large stick of wood vigorously applied
it to him. When the club was taken from
her she made effective use of her lily
white fists, until a crowd "' spectators
approached, when assailed and assailant
separated and went their ways In differ
ent directions.
McNaughton expressed no inclination to
discuss the affair further than declaring
MrÂ« Dugan a dangerous woman. The lat
ter however, made no secret of the cause
that led up to M :Naught< s severe pun
ishment. '.'_ Â Â
"I do not deny that I neat Mr Mâ -
Naughton with a club." said Mrs. Dugan
to-day. "and 1 heat him good and hard.

home again he will be sorry he ever

â¢â¢Mr McNaughton is a married man
over .VI years of age. He, has been mar
ried twice. His wife is now in Canada,
and he has five or six children, some
crown up. For a long time he roomed
and board. .1 with us. He owes us consid
erable, hm frequently sent around gro
ceries, which he regarded as^Csort of
partial payment' But lately bills began
coming in-one for S6. from Grocer Da
vis-incurred by McNaughton; and nat
urally we wouldn't pay it.
l_To make things worse this man made
love to me frequently, until I could stand
it no longer, and we ordered him to seek
elsewhere for board and lodging.
"When I went up town last nieht he
approached me is I went into a store I
told him to keep away, but he insisted
on following me. and finally I became
desperate and beat him good* and hard.
I luess I pm quite able to defend myself,

some friend write, a letter to a news
paper, in which he says I used terrible
language When I beat him. Well. 1 deny

ever comes around my house again he 11
know why he called."
INCENDIARIES FOILED.
An Unsuccessful Attempt to Set Fire
to the House of James Scott
on Virginia Street.
BERKELEY, July s.â Some unknown
persons made an attempt last night to
burn the residence occupied by James
Scott near the corner of Virginia and
Grant streets. At a late hour a box full
of inflammable materials was push. Into
thÂ» basement' if the house and lighted.
Fortunately the flames were discovered in
-ime to avert serious danger.
I The perpetrators of the deed had cvi-
The _ ,eed had , yy
dentlv laid their plans with some delib
eration. They had secured a large basket
full of nieces of paper, shavings and kind
ling wood. These combustibles were
thoroughly soaked in kerosene arid placed
under the" house. The flames gained con
siderable headway before attracting the
attention of the people within the house,
Mr Scott, who, with his three small
children, had retired some hours pre
vious was awakened by the smoke and
succeeded ln extinguishing the flames be
fore much damage was done. _he floor
and the underpinnings were already on
tire before the blaze was discovered. In
vestigation showed that the fire was with
out doubt of incendiary origin. The only
clew that can be found to the identity of
the guilty parties is a German newspaper
remaining in the bottom of the basket.

SCHAFFER TELLS
WHY HE OPPOSES
MR. MILLER
Result of a Little
Banquet.
." - â â¢ â
HIS MEN TURNED AWAY
.. Â« â
COUNCILMAN WILL CALL AN IN
DIGNATION MEETING.
The Street Superintendent Referred
Schaffer to Some of the
Latter's Published
Remarks.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July >.
Councilman Schaffer and Street Superin
tendent Miller have met and parted in
anger. No blows were struck; but wounds
were Inflicted thai will take longer to heal
than bruises.
The two gentlemen met at the City Hall
to-day and each had a grievance. Mr.
Schaffer gives tlie following view of the ;
situation and the events leading up to it. i
"Last Saturday," he said, "I went to
Mr. Miller's office at the City Hall by
his invitation. He told me that he had
no men from my wardâ the Sixthâ in the
Street Department, and that if I would
send some men to him with my card he
would put them to work. On Monday last
1 sent three men to Mr. Miller with my
cards, an*! when they presented them
they were told thai no men from mi need
expect anything. I was more than sur
prised, and asked Miller why it was so.
He showed me an Interview that I gave
to a reporter, and told me that he had
no use for any of my men.
"1 told him lip was not the Czar of Oak
land and that it was un-American to de
prive an*) honest men of a job because
he happened to have a difference with
me. If this spirit be shown by Mr. Miller
toward street work in my ward, what
chance is there for any Improvement?
Mr. Miller knows I am not in favor of
him for Street Superintendent, believing
him to be Incompetent. I shall call an in
dignation meeting in my ward to protest
against such - hods."
Tiie little interview*, that caused the
rupture was a result of that quiet ban
quet at' Councilman Taylor's house last
week. Mr. Schaffer was not invited, and
when asked for an opinion said :
"I do not feel offended because 1 was
not invited. Mr. Taylor has a right to
invite to his house any person whom lie
pleases. That is no concern of mine. I
have the same privilege.
"I do not know why I was not invited,
unless because I am not for Miller for
Superintendent of Streets. They all know
that. Mr. Barstow is not for Miller. Mr.
Kramm is not for Miller.
"I don't think that the Council has a
right to meet in private for the purpose
of jamming Mayor Snow into appointing
Mr. Miller Superintendent of Streetsâ a
man who he has already said is too ex
pensive for the place.
"The Major has said that Miller Is too
â¢â¢xpensKe. I .-:: not for Miller and they
know it. He is known to the people as
being expensive, and they have expressed
themselves to the feet that they do not
want him in office."
Mr. Miller will therefore keep Schaffer's
men out of the Street Department, and
Mr. Schaffer will go ahead and organize
his Indignation meeting.
MORE CHARGES MADE
AGAINST LAMBORN
WAR AMONG ALAMEDA'S OFFI
CIALS GROWS BITTER.
City Trustees Accused of an Attempt
to Reduce the Retail Liquor
License.
ALAMEDA, July s.â To-day the roar of
the heavy verbal artillery ' employed by
the warring factions of the city govern
ment took the place of the popping of fire
| crackers and the sizzling of rockets.
; Yesterday patriotism Impelled the citi- i
I zens to make as much noise as possible. !
j To-day the air is tilled with the din from
; whole broadsides of "caustic verbiage" \
i and mud that is being fired back and
forth by the city officials who do not dwell |
in harmony.
Trustee Schulte reiterates his charges !
of juggling with city funds made Monday
night against City Clerk Lamborn. . He I
goes further and states that the case of ;
Crocker & Co. cited at the meeting of the
Board -i! Trustees is but one of many and !
names a few more instances. He denies
\ that there is or has been .anything queer
about his official transactions and boldly
defies the clerk to drop the bombshell that j
Is to shake the Encinal from the tidal
. canal to Trustee Miller's oil works.
"After 1 was Informed of the Crocker
case," said Mr. Schulte to-day, "I went j
to the City 'Jerk's office and asked to be
allowed to see the books and the amount
due the firm mentioned. Shortly after that
visit Lamborn 'dug up' the cash in a hurry |
and took It upon himself to go to San |
Francisco and pay the bill.
"The Crocker transaction is not the only
; Instance of a similar nature that has been
' brought to the attention of the City Trus
-1 tees regarding the peculiar methods

Twelve Children.

â Â» - .-
CITY COUNCIL PROMISES A
SPEEDY RELIEF.
Residents of Annexed District Do Not
Take Kindly to Being Kept
Without a Sewer
System.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 5.
"Gentlemen, I have twelve children and
I wash them every day. If I am not given
permission to lay a sewer we cannot
wash. Gentlemen, I implore you not to
send me home to tell my twelve children
that they cannot wash to-morrow."
Such was a part of a long prayer for a
sewer read In the City Council by Henry
"Weber, one of Oakland's annexed resi
dents, who lives at Fortieth street and
Telegraph avenue. Never has a more
original document been read and placed
on file than that of the father of the
twelve Temescal children. All the Coun
cllmen acknowledged the force of the
parent's remarks and pledged themselves
to afford the speediest relief possible.
Although two years have elapsed since
annexation was decreed by a special elec
tion, nothing has been done to give the
district a proper sewer system, the suit
to declare annexation Invalid delayed
matters of improvement one year but the
annexed residents have continued to pay
taxes and now they want about $4000 ex
pended to procure a plan which will be
permanent and to which all property own
ers must conform. At present there are
hundreds of cesspools within the city lim
its, though they are prohibited under the
ordinance. ._ ,
Henry Weber, with many others, has
petitioned for permission to build a sewer,
but some large property owners have pro
tested against sewers until such time as
a system shall be devised which shall be
good for all time. Weber brought two of
his pretty young daughters to the (.ouncil
chamber with him. so that the honorable
members might see how great a hardship
lt would be if such young misses and
their ten brothers and sisters were denied
the use of soap and water.
"Is lt right, gentlemen, to persecute me
this' way?" said Weber. "All my cess
pools are full, and I run the waste water
from mv house, where fifteen of us live.
into the gutter until I was ordered to
stop I ran It Into cesspools until they are
all full, and if we wash ourselves to-mor

into the street and 1 shall be arrested by
the Board of Health. My doctor tells me
that my children are not enjoying the best
of health and that lt Is because of these
cesspools. I am willing to pay for good
sewers and I worked hard for annexation
because we were promised that we should
have some good sewers, but nothing has
been done. Gentlemen, you have no Idea
what we suffer this warm weather. Some
of the protestants are non-residents, some
need no sewers and only one has a right

"I am proud of my family. I have In
vested mv earnings where I live and do
business, and I don't want to go to jail
because I insist on cleanliness in my

The Council promised him that lt
would at once pass an ordinance appro
bating $4000 to prepare a perfect sewer
system for the district, and that all prop
erty owners would be ordered to build It
as soon as the plan Is ready.

Tenor's Mind.
OAKLAND, July s.â The recent attack

Dr. H. S. Buteau worked over the af
flicted tenor for several hours last night

patient became temporarily conscious he
would rave like a madman. Finally it
was necessary to apply straps and man
acles.
Dr. Rucker, the expert on Insanity, has
been taken into consultation, and though
he considers Mr. Wilkie's brain trouble
of a temporary nature it has been ad
vised that the tenor be removed to some
sanitarium for treatment, where he can
enjoy absolute quiet for a few weeks.

Could Not Have Ssid Farewell to Her
Boy if His Execution Had

-aâ
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â Â» _ Broadway. July 5.
The dispatch from Salt Lake City in to
day's Call stating thai Abe Majors, the
boy bandit, hud been granted a r_spite,:
was the first intimation hi.-- mother had
' that her boy was not to be shot on Friday
for the murder of Captain Brown of Box
Elder County.
Several weeks ago, in a letter to., his
mother, young Majors assured her that
he did not fire the shot that killed Brow
! but that the fatal bullet came from
Archie's gun the moment before the latter
was killed by the posse: He said that be
did not wish to pose as a coward seeking
to place his own- crime to the account of
his dead brother, but he was not anxious
to pay the penalty of a deed he had not
committed. Abe declares tnat there was
not a single bullet out of ms revolver
when it was taKen trom him after the
j fatal night in the hills.
Abe Majors has given his version or
the affair in freauent letters to his
mother. He declares that he and Archie
were passing through the country looking
for work, and that they were shut at by
a Sheriffs posse that was looking for
some highwaymen who had committed
various needs of robbery and viol nee.
Seeing the lads, the posse surrounded
them and opened fire, and Abe says that
his brother did not fire till after the
j police, while he never fired a shot. Some
j of these facts were published in The Call
a month ago and led to the efforts on the
boy's behalf that resulted in a stay of
' execution.
Mrs. Majors-Wagner, the boy's mother,
: is paralyzed at her home in this city. She
Is dependent upon friends for her nursing
and support, and at times her mind
! wanders. Had her boy been shot Friday
she would have been unable to take a
farewell of him on account of her poverty.
She has to support two children of h*r
'â . second husband. Wagner, who lives in
'â  San Francisco, is excused from paying
, alimony because he has another wife and
i children now dependent upon him.
Mrs. Majors-Wagner is firmly convinced
of her boy's innocence and believes he was
- convicted main!*.- owing to his previous
, record. When told that the case had been
taken to the Supreme Court, she was
overjoyed and she is confident that the
verdict will be reversed.
SALARIES HELD UP.
Auditor Wells Will Not Allow the \
Sewer Commission's Bills.
Auditor Wells will not allow the bills ;
j for salaries and supplies for the new
â  Sewer Commission. At last Monday's
i meeting of the Board of Supervisor, au
thorizations were passed allowing Com- |
i missioners Mansen and Grunsky $1500 each j
I on their salary accounts. In addition the
[ Commission has found it necessary to |
; purchase some supplies. These are now
all in the Auditor's hands, and he an- i
nounced yesterday that none of them
would be allowed.
Auditor Wells gives as his reasons for I
not passing on the hills that they were i
new- accounts and not necessary, and he \
did not believe they should be paid in ad
vance of bills already Incurred. More- I
over, he was ln doubt as to the legality
of the order of the Supervisors creating
â  the Sewer Commission, and as he was not ;
i authorized to secure an opinion from an
attorney he was unable to decide that
i point. The Auditor said he supposed the
proper action would be for the board to ;
I mandamus him to audit the bills, and the
court could decide whether the Auditor
should defend his course unassisted by an
i attorney. Inasmuch as he was under :
I heavy bonds for the faithful perform_,ncÂ« j
of his duty, it seemed to him that the .
! court would hardly order an attorney to ;
i appear' for him without his consent. He
said he had no wish or Intention to tie |
: up any demands that ought to be paid, j
but self-protection demanded that he act j
with caution, and as long as he was in
I doubt as to the legality of the Commis
sion he felt .that such demands as
salaries for the teachers and for furnish
ing supplies to the city, that have long
been overdue, should be paid before any â¢â 
j new bills are allowed.

TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

" thony McDonald Turned on the
Gas and Ended His Days.
Anthony McDonald, sick and despond
ent, ended his life last Tuesday night in
a room in the Hughes House, on Third
, street, near Howard.
McDonald was an engineer and nearly
j7O years old. He had been afflicted for
. yea"rs with an incurable cancer on the
! neck, and was to have gone to the City
j and County Hospital for the purpose of
having an operation performed, but his
courage failed him at the last moment
and he chose to die by his own hand rath
er than to chance a lingering death from
; the affliction which he believed to be in
! curable. McDonald was without money,
: and it was said that he had gone two days
-without food because 'if his poverty. He
was a native of Ireland and has rela
tives living ln Terre Haute, Ind.. and else
where in the East. The Coroner will hold
an Inquest.

only flourished the revolver but called
her nasty names.

The Harbor Commissioners met yester
day and decided to entirely rebuild How
ard 3 wharf. It was the Intention to re
pair the structure, but as it is In a very
bad condition Chief Engineer Holmes rec
ommended that the wharf be torn down
and a new pier similar to the one at j
Folsom 1 be built. The new wharf will i
be IW feet wide, and as it will have a j
cylinder pile foundation will outlast any
thing on the front save Pols and Pa
cific street wharves.
The rebuilding of Howard .' means the j
sending of the naval reserve ship Marion
into the stream. Several times th. chief j
wharfinger has attempted to move her
when there was an urgent demand for
berths; but the officers always managed
to keep her in her present quarters. Now
she will have to move, and 11 is doubtful
If she ever gets back again. Spreckels :
tugs will also have to move and Chief
Wharfinger Henderson is now cudgeling j
his brain to find a new location for them. |
It will have to be a permanent location, |
as they will not be allowed to back at
the new pier when it is completed in all ,
probability.
Bids for the preserving of piles to be
used on the water front were opened. The .
Pacific Refining and Roofing Company of
fered to treat the piles at 36 cents per I
foot. The Dundon Bridge and Construe-
Tier- Company at from 1!) to 45 cents per
foot, according to th- number of pounds
of creosote Injected and the length of the !
pile. The Parafflne Paint Company made!
two offers of _3' 2 and 28** cents per foot,
the difference being it; the quality of the
work done. H. R. Rood & Co., a new
factor in water front affairs, offered the
"perfection pile covering" at 27 cents a
foot.
It reaulri d some consideration to ar
rive at tin understanding of the various
bids, and also to select the best and
cheapest method. A recess of fifteen mln- j
utes was taken on the motion of Com
missioner Harney, but it was nearly an j
hour before the commission could arrive
at a decision. Finally it was agreed to
award a contract for I 1 piles each to the
Dundon Bridge and Construction Com
pany. the Parafflni Paint Company and
H. R. Rood <. Co. Dundon is to gel -7 j
cents a foot for piles twelve inches in dl- j
ameter, 30 cents for fourteen-inch and 35 j
cents for 16-inch; Parafflne Paint Cons
pany 2S'_ cents, and H. R. Rood & Co. !
27 cents for all sizes.
In April last the Board of Health sent
a communication to the Harbor Commis
sion In regard to the doc-king of vessels
from foreign ports. Captains who receive
pratique from the United States quaran
tine officer at once dock their vessels
without respect to the State quarantine
officer. The Board of Health wants all
this changed, an.i asked the Commission
ers to refuse dockage privileges to any
vessel that has not been granted pratique
by the State quarantlni officer. On that
occasion the Commissioners referred the |
communication to the board's attorney,
and did the same thing with a similar
communication that came before them -
yesterday. In this last communication
â¢stress was laid on the Nippon Maru case, !
hut the Harbor Board will not act until ]
ex-Governor Budd defines Its powers in .
the circumstances.
A bit-: fleet of sugar vessels Is now over- .
due from the Hawaiian Islands. Among j
them are some of the fastest vessels on
the coast, and the winds must be very
light In order to keep them out so long.
The bark Santiago, that lias made the
run from here to Hllo in ten days, is now
out twenty-six days for this port, and
the brig Lurline, that went down this
last trip in a little over ten days, is now
out twenty-three .lays. The ship Stand-,
ard and the barkentine Archer are each j
out twenty-one days. The Standard was
recently purchased in the Bast by Cap
tains Brown and Bachus and is on her
maiden trip to San Francisco. The Ar
cher is a smart vessel and there is some
curiosity to see which of the two makes
port first.
The ship Aryan, barkentine Irmgard
and schooner William Bowden all left the
islands on the same date. They are now
out nineteen days and the chances are
that they are participating in a drifting {
match. The bark Mohican Is now out !
twenty-five days and the new schooner
11. D. Bendlxen. on her maiden trip. Is
out twenty-two days. The Bendlxen was
heralded as a flyer, but no vessel, no mat
ter how fast, can make time with such
weather as recent arrivals from Hawaii j
have reported.
The sailing transport Tacoma was to i

termanded just as the tugs were alongside '

\ season at the Columbia Theater, is adding not
1 only laurels to his crown of successes, but gaining
j renown as the most unselfish of actors.
I 11 When Miller opened with Ins magnificent com
pany he promised that all his people were going
to get a chance to show the San Francisco public tin- best
they could do. Margaret Anglin and Edward J. Morgan
have already bad their respective chances and scored
heavily. Morgan's opportunity came in "The Liars," and
Miss Anglin shows the best there is in her in "The Adven
ture of Lady Ursula." ,
In the natural course of events it has come to Miss
Blanche Burton to delight her audiences with the many
talents that entitle her to a place In Miller's company, and
that lady's chance presents itself in "My Lord and Lady
Algy," to in- produced at the Columbia on Monday evening.
in this comedy, the reigning success of the past London
and New York season, Mr. Miller is offering the best the
play market affords, and Is casting it in a manner that
makes failure impossible. Miss Burton is to play Mrs.
Bratayn Tudway. the Dart she created in the New York
Empire Theater productionâ a role that won for her im
mediate recognition as one of the foremost comediennes
on the American stage. Mrs. Tudway is the giddy wife
of a most plebeian bone-boiler, who by virtue of his money
she consider, should have a wife who makes social
history Mrs Tudway's efforts to compel society to accept
her is" a delicious morsel of play writing, and at the hands
of Miss Burton goes for the much it is worth.
The role also affords Miss Burton unlimited opportuni
ties for handsome costuming opportunities thai she has
known how to make much of. In the fancy ball scene in
,},.. third act Miss Burton's gown is a dream, that loses
none of its airy falryness by the many other beautiful cos
tumes worn by the other ladies of the company.
Besides Miss Burton of the players of the original New
York production is Guy Standing, who will also appear ln
the part the Empire City saw. admired and applauded' Miss
Burton's excellent work in "The Liars" and delicate come

and -eadv to move the vessel. Later, how
ever another order was issued and the
vessel went to Folsom street. The la
coma is splendidly outfitted for carrying
horses and mules and the chances are
thai she will go back to Manila with an
other load She will go on the dry-dock
for an overhauling, after which she will
load supplies and take on horses and
mules for the Philippines.
Miss Katherine Grey, the actress who
left here for a visit to Honolulu on the
steamer Doric, changed her mind when
the vessel reached the Paradise of th
Pacific. She and her grandmother. Mrs
Reid. had such a delightful trip down to
Hawaii and the officers of the steamer
had made everything so pleasant that at
the last moment they decided to make
the round trip to China on the Doric.
MisÂ« Grey was to have been back here by
August 1 to take her place In Richard
Mansfield's company, but it will be long
after that date before she gets back to
San Francisco. --__-,
The Stockton steamer H. J. Corcoran
was nearly three hours late getting away
this morning. A steam pipe hurst on the
wav down and repairs had to be made be
fore the could leave again.
The steamer Australia took away last
Monday what was probably the most val
uable cargo thai has ever left here for
Honolulu. Among it was a lot of barley,
fresh fruit, fifty-three coops of chickens,
canned goods, dried fruit, sugar, tea. to
bacco, wine, whisky and other goods to
the value of $151,760.
Captain Wester of San. Francisco, owner
of the Chilean ship Star of Italy, has be
come a benedict during his vessel a stay
in Australia. The Star is loading coal
at Newcastle, N. S. W.I for San Fran
cisco and several weeks ago the captain
took a few days off and was married to
Miss Schuler. Captain Wester will bring
his bride to San Francisco with him.
There were only two arrivals in port
during the twenty-four hours yesterday.
The steamer Bonita got in from Southern
ports and the schooner Lena Sweasey
from Tai oma. The steamers Weeott from
Eureka Alice Blanchard from Coos Bay
and Grace Dollar from San Pedro were
expected but did not show up until late

THE SAN FT. AN CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 6, 1899.
TAKES NO CHANCES
OF GETTING LEFT
SOUTHERN PACIFIC LOOKS AF
TER IMMIGRANT TRAVEL.
Stubbs and McCormick Will Go East
Next Saturday to Protect the In
terests of Their Road.
E. O. McCormick, passenger traffic man
tiger .if the Southern Pacific, will leave on
Saturday next for Chicago, New York
and various other points in the East. He
will be gone several weeks and J.C. Stubbs
will also leave at the same time for New
York, where he goes in order to confer
with C. P. Huntington and other mag
nates of the railroad world on matters
of importance connected with the South
ern Pacific.
The reason of Mr. McCormlck's trip
is first to become personally acquainted
with the passenger agents .if his road who
are located in the different cities of the
East and secondly to attend the meeting
of the Immigration Bureau, which takes
place in New- York about the 17th of the
month. V-- .
This Immigration Bureau is maintained
by the different Western roads and the
Canadian Pacific to see that the horde of
arriving immigrants from the different
points of Europe is equally and fairly
proportioned to the different roads so
that each gets Its just share of the busi
ness which they represent-
Before the conception of such a thing
as an Immigration Bureau the arrivals
from Europe were dump*! at Castle Gar
den and left to their own devices to get
along a? best they could. As for the most
part they are Ignorant, unsophisticated
people, who have never before been away
from their own little native village, they
fared badly indeed, becoming the easy
prey of every species of confidence man
that Infests a large city. The railroads
were accustomed to struggle each with
the other for the privilege of carrying
them to their different destinations and
the road having the foxiest runner was
the one that secured the biggest percent
age of the travel.
This naturally gave rise to considerable
crooked work and much 111-feeling. Con
sequently several years ago the different
roads met and agreed to jointly maintain
a bureau whose business it would be to
see that each line got what was properly
its share and no more.
From time to time meetings are called
for the purpose of readjustment, and to
such a meeting Mr. McCormick is now
going to see that In the new deal the
Southern Pacific gets all that is coming
to it and as much more as it can secure.
incidentally with its other business the
bureau took upon itself the protection of
the immigrant and succeeded in regu
lating matters to such a nicety that now
the youngest and most Ignorant foreigner
that ever came out of Europe may start
from his home and be landed in the most
distant part of the West without having

A CASTILIAN SHAMED.
Captain de la Torre of Equestrian An
cestry Unhorsed by a Vege
table Wagon Plug.
Captain A. de la Torre, Deputy Immi
gration Commissioner and Spanish In
terpreter for the United States Immigra
tion Bureau, limped stiffly and sorely
around the office yesterday with the; aid
of a stout cane. He no longer wore the
proud and cavalier mien that distin
guished him on the Glorious Fourth,
when he bestrode a fiery steed (formerly
in the vegetable line) at the head of. the
Mardi Gras part of the parade. The fair
ladles who gazed in admiration from th.
bay windows upon the bay steed ridden
at a -walk by Captain de la Torre- little
wotted how much it pained the captain
to smile at them in return. But 'twas
so. He was sore all over, and_ a little
more on the spot. upon which he was sil
ting than on any other. ; '. .
It happened that when the captain was
waiting for the signal to start, his
Rosinante leaped wildly into the air to
escape a bomb that had exploded upder
him and then sat down upon the cobbles -
but the misfortune, was that the captain
occupied the place where the horse sat.
It was a horse on the captain, and it will
be many a day before he gets over it.
"It was not that 1 was thrown from the
horse, or that I can hardly sit down,"
said the captain, "but what hurts my
Castlllan pride the most is the fact that
I, the descendant of a race of cavaliers
who lived In the saddle and rode only-
Arabian steeds, should have been un
horsed by a plug owned by Giu>,
Bacigalupi." And the captain wept.
Was Tired of Restraint.
Daniel Kerwln, who had been under re
straint in his house, 308 Fulton street, and
was being attended by Dr. Jackson,
made his escape yesterday morning, and
created a sensation, as he was not dressed
for company. He ran till he reached the
Bishop's study, corner of Franklin and
O'Farrell streets. A message was sent to
the Central police station, and Policemen
Calllnan and Burns went out in the
patrol wagon and took him to the insane
ward in the Receiving Hospital. He is
said to be suffering from the effects of
too much liquor. > _:<;
Battered a Boy.
Jacob Label, a cigar dealer at 119 O'Far
rell street, was arrested yesterday on a
warrant charging him with battery. The
complaining witness is Arthur Peterson,
a boy living at 142_ Market street, who
alleges that while walking past Label's
store Tuesday with a bundle of firecrack
ers. Label took them from him and set
some off. When the boy asked him to pay
for those he had used he refused and
struck him on the nose, making it bleed.
USED NOVEL MEANS OF
GAINING CONFESSIONS
JOHN BAXTER, A BLACKSMITH,
IMMERSES SUSPECTS.
Fifteen-Year-Old Boy, Accused of
Stealing a Harness, a Victim of
His Practices.
John Baxter, a blacksmith' at 426 Pa- j
cific street, cherishes the novel idea that
Immersion in cold water is a proper caper
for drawing from boys confessions of ;
guilt. Last night he applied this treat
ment to Peter Mayntzer, a 15-year-old
boy whom he accuses of having robbed !
him of a harness, and in consequence was
soon landed at the California-street sta
tion by Officers Peters * and Bell and
charged with having used threats to do
great bodily harm.
Two weeks ago Baxter sent Mayntzer
and a boy whom he employs on an errand
and provided them with a team. In the
afternoon both returned, unhitched the
horses and placed the harness in its ac
customed place In the barn. Next day
the harness was missing and Baxter im- ;
mediately blamed Mayntzer for its disap
pearance. He had no proof to back up his
accusation save the fact that the boy- j
knew where the article was kept in the j
barn. Mayntzer protested his Innocense,
but the blacksmith clung to his belief.
Last night when Mayntzer entered Bax
ter's shop he was siezed by his accuser
and a confession was demanded from him.
He stated that he had none to make, as
he had not been guilty of the theft,
whereupon Baxter plunged him into a
trough of water used for cooling hot
irons. In his struggles the boy upset the
tub, but Baxter quietly refilled it with a
hose and made preparations ' for giving
him another dousing. He continued his
threats to such an extent that Mayntzer
finally said he did take the property, but I
later informed the police that it was in
the hope that such a statement might save
him a further development of goose-flesh
that he did so. Two boys, Albert To fa- ;
nelli and Frank Major, witnessed the oc- '
currence through a window and gave the
alarm to Officer Bell, who was in the:
neighborhood.
\\ hen the officer was sighted Baxter's
hired boy gave him the tip, and he start- i
ed to leave the place and avoid the offi
cer. Bell had to chase him some distance
before he caught him. It is said that this
is not the first offense of a similar nature
committed by the prisoner. The boys In ;
the vicinity of his shop state that he fre- j
quently plunges them into water when \
they deny what he has attributed to them.
CAKEWALK CARNIVAL.
Active Preparations Now Being Made
at Mechanics' Pavilion.
Preparations are now being made for
the coming Cake Walk Carnival at the
Mechanics' Pavilion. Carpenters are
building floats, decorators are trimming
pretty booths and painters are outlining
canvas for scenes typical of the old and
modern cake walk.-. The many men,
womeli and children who will participate
are busy rehearsing, so that they may be
in the best of trim for the contests.
It is the intention of the management
to present a glittering spectacle and the
greatest series of championship cane
walks of all styles ever seen in this city
or any other city. The low rate of ad
mission and the fact that a fair share of
the receipts goes toward a California
soldiers' fund insures a most successful
affair. -V -.- â¢ '>7-
The entry list includes 150 couples who
will compete in the "various contests for
championship honorsâ professional, socie
ty,..juvenile, delsartean, colored and ama
teur events. In addition there will be ex
hibition cake walks, including Filipino,
grotesque, Chinese, Cuban, plantation,
Dewey and others that will certainly
please. * . ;
The various societies and social or
ganizations are taking advantage of the
liberal terms offered to arrange for special
nights. California Parlor, Native Son. of
the Golden West, will increase their "lf-OO
Celebration Fund" by selling several
thousand tickets for* the carnival. Other
organizations to be benefited are lodges of
the Knights of Pythias, Professor-
Francis' Ladies' Mandolin Club, Maine
Social Club. Lodge of Woodmen and
others. The terms are liberal and can be
learned at 26 O'Farrell street, room 8.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan. 1017-1023 Mission, j

MANNING'S VICTIM
NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE
[Lamp-Thrower Has No Excuse
1 or Explanation to Offer.
art ra RS. KENNEDY, the unhap
7/\J/\t P>" victim of Cornelius Man-
II ) I \ n!n e. the lamp thrower, is
Jl Jft_ U^not expected to live. She ie
horribly burned from the
crown of her head to her waist and
besides suffers intense agony from the
flames she inhaled.
Yesterday she was removed from the
Harbor Receiving Hospital to her
home at 730 Hayes street, where hrr
husband and friends are doing every
thing medical skill can suggest to
alleviate the sufferings of the unfor
tunate woman.
In the bed beside Mrs. Kennedy lies
her little 5-year-old niece. Maud Ken
nedy, her frail little limbs blistered
from knee to toe. Maud has been the
wonder and admiration of the attend
ing physicians. When she was brought
on Tuesday evening with her aunt
to the Harbor Hospital Bhe astonished
every one present with her wonderful
nerve, unselfishness and bravery.
While Mrs. Kennedy lay on the oper
ating table, having her awful wounds
dressed, little Maud sat quietly by,
never a cry, nor shedding a tear. To
the attending physician who offered
to assist her first she replied in lisping
tones, "Tend to aunty; I can wait.".

MRS. ROSS IN THR TANKS
â â
HELD FOR THIRTY-SIX HOURS
ON SUSPICION.
â +â
When Threats Were Made of Habeas
Corpus Proceedings She Was
Charged With a Petty
Offense.
Â
The arrest of Mn. Annie Ross at 9 !
o'clock Tuesday morning and her sudden
release yesterday afternoon, after thirty- j
six hours' confinement ln the illegal j
"tanks" of the City Prison, was the sub
ject of considerable comment in and about
the Hall yesterday afternoon, and may j
result in a searching investigation into
certain Siberian methods of the police.
Mrs. Ross was arrested in her room at ;
310 Mason street early Tuesday morning i
by Detectives Crockett and Wren. The
officers had no warrant, but simply
showed their badges of authority and i
took the woman Into custody, explaining
that they expected to connect her with
several petty offenses, and she would be
detained until sufficient evidence could be j
gathered to make a "direct charge. The j
woman's husband at once secured the ser
vices of Attorney George W. Montelt i,
Instructing him to secure her release a* j
soon aspossible. Mr. Montelth went to i
the City Prison yesterday morning and
demanded permission to see his client. He i
was at first refused, but a permit was j
finally granted, with the proviso that a
detective be present during the Interview. I
As soon as Mr. Montelth learned that
no charge ha.', been placed against his
client he demanded her release or that a
charge should be placed against her. The
police refused to take action either way,
and the attorney at once took the in
itiatory steps toward securing a writ of
habeas corpus. Before the writ could is
sue a charge of lining goods by false
pretenses was booked against the woman,
and she was released on bail a few hours
later. NSsre/ â '
In explanation of this charge Mrs. Ross
said: "I fully understand this charge and
can easily prove my Innocence of it. 1
worked for a family named Ash, on Post
street. When the time came for me to
collect my wages Mrs. Ash said she had
no money, and gave me permission to
take out what was due me in groceries.
I went to Levin Bros.' store, on Post
itreet, and ordered about a dollar's worth,
which were delivered at my room. When
the bill came for these goods to Mrs. Ash
=he refused to pay for them, stating that
[ had never had permission to order them
on her account. SENS
"The police really detained me in their
sweat box at the hall to try and connect
me with a robbery which occurred at 417
Mason street. A sealskin coat and a par
cel of bonds and mortgages are alleged to
.Â«.ve been taken from the room of a man
swollen face and blood-shot eyes show
the evidence of continual dissipation
and debauchery. A natty suit, "sum
mer girl" shirt, pale colored tie and
pearl gray Fedora hat helped make
an Incongruous picture of the whisky
shaking wretch, who had no explana
tion to make or excuse to offer and re
ferred all questions to his attorney,
J. N. E. Wilson.
At the Manning home on Jones
street, near Greenwich,, misfortune
had again been a visitor and the resi
dence was gutted with water and filled
with smoke, the result of a Are that
originated at noon yesterday in a flat
next dcor.
Mrs. Manning, prostrated over her
twofold trouble, denied herself to vis
itors, while the daughter explained for
the mother that the lamp whose oil
fed the flames that blistered Mrs. Ken
nedy was not Intended for her mother
but for Mr. Kennedy.
"Drink did it," said Miss Manning,
"but Con loved my mother and did not
want to injure her. He was quarrel
ing: with Kennedy and threw the lamp
at him."
Paul Kennedy, the husband of the
injured woman, declares that the burn
ing lamp which struck his wife was
not aimed at him, but at Manning's
mother. "My wife, my little niece, two
little nephews and myself," said Ken
nedy, "had been spending the day with
-Mrs. Manning and were getting ready
to go when Con Manning came in. A
i named Russell at that place. I was ac
cused at the time of having taken them,
but no evidence was found against me;
as a matter of fact, I have ample proof
that I was In the Orpheum with my hus
band when the robbery took place. I
am confident that nothing would ever had
been said regarding the groceries had it
not beer; for the fact that such strong
efforts wen made to secure my release.
If that is what 1 was arrested for. why
did not they charge, me with it at once
and give my husband an opportunity to
secure my release on ball? The groceries
were found In my room, and they oould
easily have taken them for evidence."
Mr. Ross, the woman's husband, is in
! dignant over the manner in which his
: wife was dragged from bed to the prison
by detectives without a warrant, and
also the rough and careless way _n which
they searched the premises for evidence.
Attorney Monteith says that as soon as
the case against Mrs. Ross Is disposed of
he Intends starting a vigorous crusade
against the detinue system.
"This so-called 'small' or detinue book,"
he said, "is a high-handed outrage. It
would shame a Russian to be connected
with such a nefarious scheme. The po
lice and the detectives have absolutely no
'his so-called â¢small' or detinue book,"
said, "is a high-handed outrage. It
ild shame a Russian to be connected
i such a nefarious scheme. The po
:j r : 1 1 the detectives hnve absolutely no
right to arrest any person except in two
casesâ where they catch them commit
ting an unlawful act, or in close proxim
ity to one, when they may arrest them
without warrant, and In cases where they
are in possession of a warrant- of arrest.
If a detective came to my house to arrest
a member of my family without a warrant
I would exercise my right of defense and
would kill him If necessary to prevent
him from doing it. It is in nowise resist
ing an officer when he is undertaking to
act without legal authority. He stands
in no letter position than any private In
dividual and an arrest without authority
of law ma;* be resisted to the death if
necessary. The cowardly police, how
ever, generally use some Judgment and
discretion with reference to the people
whom they Impose upon in this manner.
"1 think the tanks at the City Prison
are a fit subject for Investigation by the
Grand Jury. There may be men in. there
m they impose upon in this manner,
think the tanks at the City Prison
a tit subject for investigation by the
nd Jury. There may be men in there
to-day who have been held for years on
'suspicion' or through some other motive."
At about 6 o'clock last night Mr. Rus
sell.* from whose room the sealskin coat
and other articles were taken, visited
Monteith's office and proposed that they
"fix" the case between them. Mr. Mon
ti ith indignantly spurned the proposal
and Russell left, threatening to see Ross'
employers.

on Sansome street on Tuesday night, is ',
In a critical condition at the Receiving i

the bullet was fired by some one unknown \
to her while she was walking with her
brother and sister, but the police think

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY , 6, 1899.
few moment- later John Talton. a
neighbor, came to call upon Mrs. Man
ning and in the course of conversation
remarked about a certain young man
who lived near by and let his mother
support him. Con took the story as a
personal allusion and began to abuse
Talton. whereupon Talton remarked
It was evident his company was not
desired and left the house.
"After Talton. went Mrs. Manning
chided Con for his abuse of his friend
and Con became very offensive in his
remarks to his mother and threatened
to do her up. I strove to calm him,
and catching him by both arms pinned
him down to the sofa. He begged for
me to release him and promised to be
quiet. I let him go and he passed Into
the next room, where two lighted
lamps were on the table. First \he
grabbed the smaller lamp and let it
drop on the floor. He then seized the
larger lamp, and aiming at his mother
flung it. My wife, who saw what he
was doing, rushed In front of Mrs.
Manning to save her and received the
burning lamp right in the face. I
rushed to her rescue and in attempt
ing to smother the flames had both my
hands burned. Little Maud was in the
room and the flames that started up
from the first lamp gave her her in
juries."
No charge has yet been placed
against Manning and he will not be
booked for several days pending the
result of Mrs. Kennedy's injuries.
T. DANIEL FRAWLEY
IS AGAIN IN TOWN
WILL OPEN AT THE CALIFOR-
NIA NEXT WEEK.
Blanche Bates and the Rest of the
Company Winning New Laurels
in the East.
T. Daniel Frawley arrived on the be
lated overland train last night direct from
Milwaukee, where the Frawley Company
is playing a very successful engagement.
Mr. Frawley was accompanied by Miss
Manola Mould, a daughter of Marion
Manola, who joins the company ln this
city as ah ingenue.
The Frawley Company will open at the
California a week from to-night for an en
gagement for five and a half week.,
in "The Last Word," "which will run
through the week. The following week
Mr. Frawley intends to put on a split bill,
opening with "A Dancing Girl." "London
Assurance," in which Miss Blanche Bates
will appear in the costume of the girl of
the period, the hoopsklrt period, will close
the week. "Madame Sans Gene," with
Miss Bates in the title role and Augustus
Cook, the original "Napoleon," in the
cast, will also be produced with entirely
new â¢ costumes. Miss Bates rehearsed
"Madam Sans Gene" with the late Angus
tin Daly, and she plays the part with the
art and force which have characterized
all her work in the past, and which have
given her a deserved fame in the theatri
cal profession.
The public will probably also have an
opportunity to see "An Enemy to the
King," and possibly one or two other'
plays. Much will depend, however, on the
result of a conference between Mr. Fraw
ley and Manager S. H. Friedlander of tho
California. - â¢ â¢- ;
The other members of the company will
arrive next Thursday. With it are such
old favorites as Charles W. King, who
was a member of the original Frawley
Company; Miss Mary Van Buren, who, in
addition to her ability as an actress, is
a noted stage beauty; Mrs. F. M. Bates,
an old California actress and the mother
of Blanche; J. R. Amory, the comedian,
and others. â¢â¢:..:
Mr. Frawley is a believer In omens to a
certain extent, and unlike most people,
he considers thirteen to be a lucky num
ber. His contract with Mr. Friedlander,
which was signed on May 13, was for
a thirteen weeks' engagement, to begin I
on the 13th of the present month, and
there are thirteen men' and women in his '
company.

DODGE ANSWERS
THE CRITICS OF
HIS ASSESSMENT
He Insists That He
Has Been Just.
âa . ~~
EQUALIZATION OF TAX VALUES
. . â â â
REDUCTIONS MADE TO SMALL
HOLDINGS.
.
The Assessor Explains the Increase
He Has Made in the Valuations
of City and County Real
Estate.
Assessor Dodge takes exceptions to the
statement that while he has made cor
porate and capitalistic classes pay more
than they have hitherto done and has
made them bear proportionately their*
share of municipal taxes he has not re
duced the assessed valuation of the prop
erty of small real estate holders. Dr.
Dodge declares, on the contrary, that he
has reduced the assessed valuation of this
class of property fully $3,000,000, and that
the reduction in the Richmond district
alone will amount to over a million dol
lars, notwithstanding the views of certain
Supervisors as expressed in The Call yes
terday morning. Assessor Dodge accuses
his critics of unfairness in their analysis
of his figures and he intimates that the
methods adopted to discredit his efforts to
lighten the burden of the people will not
stand the light of investigation. Politics,
he declares, is at the bottom of the at
tack and he expresses confidence that the
taxpayers will back him up in the po
sition he has taken. The following state
ment in reference to the matter was yes
terday dictated by Dr. Dodge to a Call
reporter:
"Some misapprehension has been caused
by the announcement in one of the morn
ing dailies that the Assessor had not re
duced the assessment of the small prop
erty owners and this has been used as
the basis of criticism. An investigation
of the facts shows that the writer of the
article referred to was misinformed.
"Assessor Dodge states that the an
nouncement made a week ago and pub
lished in The Call was absolutely correct,
namely, that the assessed value of all real
estate, covering an area of three-fourths
of the city and county, has been reduced
10 to 20 per cent from last year's assess
ment, making an aggregate reduction of
$3,000,000 on real estate alone. The fact
that the real estate roll of this year ir.
over $2,000,000 greater than last year has
led to the inference that the value of the
land had been increased to the amount
of $2,000,000. This is also erroneous. The
fact is that the term real estate embraces
valuations both of land and improvements
ami the increase of $2,000,000 this year over
last year In real estate assessments is
made up entirely of the increase in im
provements, mainly new buildings. As an
actual fact the real estate is $500,000 less
than last year, the $3,000,000 decrease in
the valuation of outside lands being al
most entirely offset by the Increased as
sessment of land in the business sections,
this often being covered by mortgages
and in many instances assessed for less
than the face value of the mortgage. In
these cases the assessed value was raised,
where land was worth it, to the amount
of the mortgage. This throws the tax on
the bank that holds the mortgage and
which lias received taxes ob the face of
the mortgage through the increased rate
of Interest demanded on the mortgage
owing to the fact that the banks know
that they must pay the tax.
"In this manner nearly $3,000,000 reduc
tion in the value of small real estate hold
ings has been effected by increase in other
directions."
NIGHTMARE OF JOSEPH GUMMING
He Will Have Charge of the Tagalos at the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
SECRETARY JOE CUMMING of the Mechanics' Institute spent his holi
days out of town, but he was not thinking of merriment or the pleasures
of an outing; he was mentally grappling with the problem of the Fili
pinos and what they are to eat when they come to build a Filipino vil
lage in the Pavilion annex for the coming fair. What to eat, that's the
question that has to be settled, and a stalwart chicken broods over Mr. Cum
ming's dreams, giving him no rest. The Filipinos' bill of fare must be ar
ranged for before the families from Luzon arrive, and as they have already '
started they are expected here the last of this month. Mr. Cummlng's un
easiness had an Innocent beginning. He was reading over the 131-word dis- |
patch from Manila announcing the success of Agent Thomas' mission.
"Clark." he said, suddenly, "what do these Filipinos eat?"
"Oh, chickens and rice," was the reply. Now. Carlton H. Clark was the
California Commissioner to the Guatemala Exposition, and knows the habits
of natives in tropical countries. So Cumming gasped.".'â *â¢*'
"How many chickens?" he asked.' .*"â¢â â¢: â _ i. v
"One a meal for each person and as many meals a day as they can get,
Clark answered. v; >*â _â¢"'%'.â "â¢â â¢ ___._. _* Â».Â«.-.'
Frank H. Lombard, who was the purser of the Scandia on her first trip to
Manila happened in, and as he is presumably an authority on the Filipino
diet his Ideas on the subject were asked.
"Chickens and rice. That's all they can get in that miserable country,"
said Lombard. , Â
"All!" exclaimed Cumming. "All! With chickens a dollar apiece what
more do they want?" __Â»_.*. ,
"Sixty-live Filipinos, one chicken each at every meal and three meals a day
for sixty-eight days," he figured, "would make 15,600 chickens. Say I could
get them at $1 25 a pair, that Would make $9750, and it would be $12,000 with the
rice. It's terrible to think of." .
So Secretary Cumming tosses around in his bed at night and dreams
dreadful visions of abnormal chickens devouring the Mechanics' Pavilion.
He has only one hope, and that is a. faint one.- He asked the captain of a
whaling ship who never has been to the Philippines what to feed the Fili
pinos on. and the captain said:
"If they're anything like the Eskimo, give the pigs salt pork.'
Secretary Cumming has received a dispatch from Mr. Thomas announcing
that the transport Leelanaw, which sailed for San Francisco from Manila last
Monday, took sixty-five Filipinos, with a lot of curios, for the Mechanics'
Fair. There are nine musicians with the native musical instruments among
the crowd.
