ESTERHAZY'S
CONFESSION
NEW YORK. Aug. 9.'â A Journal (
cable from Rennes says: Com- â *
of the court-martial which is try- **
ing Dreyfus, has received a letter C
from Major Esterhazy. The letter â .
is Esterhazy"s refusal to return i
from London as a -witness at the *
trial in response, to a subpena and *
guarantee of safe conduct from
the French Government. It is a -i
rambling and disjointed communi- i
cation of HGO words, evidently the j
w.> rk of a disjointed mind. . *
That Esterhazy is practically _\
mad everybody who has met him 5
knows. His emaciated face, hjs f_
burning, glittering eyes, sunken â *
deep in their sockets, his deeply -C
furrowed forehead and his high. *
spasmodic, nervous tension all
show clearly to any alienist the v
v
incurable result cf sleeplessness. A
dissipation and absinthe. (_
Esterhazy makes "specific state- _,
ments in the letter just received, r
which are of the highest sigr.ifi-
cancel as follows: C
"I entered into relations â with 4
Scbwarzkoppen, the German mill- C
... attache, in ISM- Schwarz- â¢*
k-rr-n told me that he had in his Â»
service at the French Ministry of <â¢
War a captain of artillery. I told ';
this to Sandherr and he said: *I c
know the man ar.d I've got him.' c
"I wrote the bordereau on Sand- J
h-rr*s instructions- and took it '
mjself to the German embassy
when I knew Schwarzkoppen was _,
a*ay from Paris on leave. It was t m
seized there by one of our agents. _-.
a German, and taken to Colonci %
Her.ry. j
"Henry was my friend. I had C
lived beside him. fcr a long __me. -*
He knew me very well. He knew (
my handwriting better than any- -.
body. Henry said to me. 'Our â¢'
hands are full of proof against -.
Dreyfus.' " (
These are specific statements. â *
a._d this was the absolute begin- '
r.:r._r cf the action against Drey- .
fus. The two active agents in +
causing it were Esterhazy and Â£

yesterday. Stror.s" detachments of in
fantry instead of cendarmes, cordoned
the streets leadir..: to the Lycee. Gen
darmes alone performed this duty yes
terday, and the people, who were much
less numerous, barely, mustering 200
persons, were Dressed still further back.
Even persons standing inside the en
trance hail of the house within view of
the door of the Lycee were compelled
by gendarmes to retreat into the in
terior of the house and the front door
was closed. Absolutely nobody but the
police and soldiers were thus within 100
yards cf Dreyfus when he crossed the
Avenue de ia Gare.
The police authorities expla'^i th*
rigor of these measures on the ground
that yesterday a few cries against the
prisoner were raised while he was
crossing the avenue. Not a discordant
note was heard anywhere to-day.
WHY THE DOSSIER IS
SO CLOSELY GUARDED
NE^ TORK. Aug. s.â The Journal has
the following from Paris:
â¢'I can speak with authority upon the
.â¦â¢â¦â¢â¦â â¦â¢â¦-â¦â¢â¦â¢â¦â¢â¦-#
dossier now under examination at Rei
nes. for I know its contents from the one
man who has mastered it best- That man
is Demange. Dreyfus' lawyer. He studied
every word of it twice â first in- IÂ»_4 and
again before the present trial began.
The dossier is a collection of numerous
documents supposed to bear upon the
Dreyfus case. It cohsists cf two parts â
namely, military and diplomatic.
"It is composed of about nine hundred
different papers. Of these seven hundred
are wholly unimportant. There are many
------ women. - retailing gossip.
Three women are either personal ends
of army officers or their mistresses. Their
chatter is of no consequence. It is some
thing like this: 'I met a woman who met
another woman who heard another wom
an say she knew a woman who dreamed
that Dreyfus had relations with the
German Embassy.'
"None but mer. blinded by crazy preju
dice could think of putting such silly let
ters in the dossier. In point of fact some
of the higher officers are not only preju
diced but ignorant. The intellectua
weakness of Boisdeffre and Mercier was
the laughing stock of the army before
attention was called off by the Dreyfus
case.
" "Of the two hundred serious papers
seme are reports of more or less conse
cuence. There are some forgeries in the
dossier. The reason for secrecy does not |
arise from anything the dossier contains
regarding Dreyfus. It is because certain
documents or letters mention a scandal
in which Schwartskoppen. the military |
attache, and Panizzard!. the Italian mill- 1
tar;.- attache, are alleged to be concerned. I
The Countess de Munster's name is also
connected with that of another well
known woman of Paris.
"Revelations of this nature, even if well \
founded, would not bring on a war ...
either Germany or Italy. If war is made
for such a cause, then let it come.
"The German Emperor, with his well
defined ideas of ethics, would be the first
to punish the perpetrators Of such a
crime!
"The present examination is not defini
tive. It .for the purpose cf separating
the documents pertaining 'to Dreyfus
from others. There will then be a pub
lic examination of the former, but names,
the mention Of which misht give offense. j
will not be uttered. Such is Gallifet's or- j
"In the United States such evidence as
Is furnished by the dossier would not be
strong enough to bring a 'man into court.
"Dreyfus will be acquitted.

FIREMEN INJURED IN A DISASTROUS BLAZE IN A MARKET
SACRAMENTO. Aug. s.â The little
town of Lincoln, Placer County,
is in a state of frenzy over the
murder of Frank S. Landis,
brother of the Clerk of Placer
County, J. B. Landis, and son of John
Landis. a prominent merchant of Sac
ramento.
Two men are under arrest to-night
Dn suspicion of complicity in the mur- j
ier. One of them is John Alber. anj
employe of the Lincoln cannery. The
suspicion Ls slight, but the Sheriff of }
Placer County is determined that th- j
guilty man shall not escape.
Nobody in all Placer County was bet- !
:er liked than ycung Frank Landis of j
Lincoln. He and his brother kept the I
eading store in the town and when the I
.rother became County Clerk the man- j
igement of the establishment fell to >
Frank. No hour was too late for young j
L-andis to accc mmodate a customer and '
ie could be seen as late as midnight j
.pening up his store to serve some I
friend with a trifling want. It was this
rpirit of accommodation that led to his I
ieath-
This morning before daylight Mrs. \
Ewitzler, who lives within view of f
Landis' store, arose to prepare an early j
breakfast. She had laid out a ham and j
plate of biscuit the night before, but {
when she -:-â¢- . them this morning f

she notified E- v 7. Redding, the night \
watchman, of her loss and also of herf
liscovery "with reference to the store.
Redding proceeded to investigate. He t
opened the store door, .only to be con- [
fronted by the corpse of Frank Landis I
lying upon the floor. His hat and re- [
e-oiver lay on the floor a short distances

had been exploded. Suicide was the j

to attack General Ramon Pacheco at Da
jabon. the headquarters of the evolu
tionists, was abandoned wiien he arrived
in front of the enemy by his troops, who,
without tiring a shot, deserted and en-
red the camp of General Pacheco. The
advanced posts of the latter are at Las
Agiias, and the revolutionists are masters
of the fords across the River Yaque. thus
cutting off communication between Monte
Christ! and the interior. The forces of
Don Juan Isidore Jiminez. leader of the
revolution, are being augmented every
day and news from every part of the
Dominican republic is favorable to him.

The latest news from San Domingo says
the revolutionary movement is extending
and the province of Vega is in arms.
It is impossible to obtain any details
here. The city is calm.
The relations between the United
States and Hayti are cordial. The Hay-
Tien Government has authorized the erec
tion of an American meteorological sta
tion at Cape Haytlen. The permission
to establish such a station had previously
been refused and the fact that permission
has now been grant* d demonstrates the
extension of American influence in Hayti.

NEW YORK. Aug. 9.â Almost all of the
testimony elicited at the Mazet legisla- |

how frequently men are robbed in this
city while paying 'visits to the Tender
loin, the "Bowery" and other sections of
the city, whore groups gather after the
midnight hours.
Mr. Mops had difficulty in obtaining wit
nesses for to-day's session. The men who
had been victims of this sort of crime
were decidedly averse to appearing before
the committee and telling about it. Two
hundred and fifty subpenas had been Is
sued for men who had been robbed by
women: Not a quarter of them could be
found. Nevertheless. Mr. Moss was able
to put witness after witness upon the
stand and obtain account after account
of robberies alleged to have occurred in
disorderly houses in this city. Occasion
ally the witnesses under oath told of facts
which appeared to show collusion be
tween the police and the female robbers.
Mr. Moss announced that, similar testi
mony with variations would be product
before the committee to-morrow. The
variations, it is understood, refer to an
investigation of the opium dens of the

TO AN AWFUL END
Once Popular Actress Fatally Burned
in a Meadow Fire Near Coney
Island.
NEW YORK, Aug. 9.â A big meadow
fire occurred on Coney Island this after
noon. When it was extinguished the
burned district covered an area nearly a
mile square. A woman was found lying

ance in this city at Wood's Theater, ap
pearing in the burlesque "Elves." Jennie
also played a leading role in the farce,

same theater. They leased the New York
Theater, which they managed for two
years and then went on a starring tour
through the country. Of late years Jennie
Worrell has not appeared on the stage
because she was a confirmed inebriate.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. 9.â A dispatch
from Durango, Mexico, says that Man
uel Lopez Serano, constructor in the â¢
service of the Federal Telegraph Com- j
pany, has just reached that city from
the Y'aqui Indian country, where he has j
been employed for the past ten months
extending the Government telegraph
lines to remote mountain and river val
ley towns and village-.. He left Cocori,
a thriving little town in the rich Yaqui
River Valley, shortly after the recent i
outbreak of the Yaquis occurred and
he had an escort of a troop of Mexican
cavalry to the mouth of the river,
where. 'he caught a boat for Mazatlan,
from which place he' came to Durango
and took the train this evening for the
City Of Mexico.
Serano said the Government was in j
much better shape to make a successful
campaign against the rebellious tribe :
How than in any of the previous wars. j
Immediately after the signing of the
treaty of peace over two years ago the
War Department directed the Federal
Telegraph Company to connect every
town and village in the old Yaqui
country with. the. general telegraph sys- ,
tern. This has been done and there is J
now hardly a point in the turbulent
territory that is not in direct tele- j
graphic communication with the War j
Department. Every move that roving i
bands of Yaquis make is Instantly
known to the military authorities and
the movement of troops is directed ac- i
cordingly, lt is expected some of these |
wires will be cut and the lines de- j
stroyed by the Indians, but some of the j
circuits will be kept intact and the |
campaign properly directed from the
City of Mexico.
In former wars with the Y'aquis there
was no telegraphic communication with
the unknown region and the troops had
to use their own judgment as to the
conduct of the campaign, with the re
suit that they would often be drawn
into ambush or b made to travel hun
dreds of miles on a fruitless chase after '
the wily braves. Continuing, Senor j
Serano said:
"I am convinced that the War De- !
partment is thoroughly informed as to
the relative position of every warring
Indian band in the Yaqui Valley and
that the troops now being massed along
the lower course of the river will strike
at the vital points when the word is
given to move. The present rising
causes the Mexican military authori
ties no surprise, it has been expected
for over a year. The first information
of the contemplated outbreak was given
to General Torres by the old Yaqui
chief, Tebiate, several months ago, and
immediately thereafter the work of
massing troops in the State of Sonora
began and has been going on ever since,
until there are now over 8000 available
men.
"The war will be over in a few
months. There will be no temporizing
with the Indians this time. It is going
to be a campaign Of extermination- and
the Yaquis will have to succumb to a
greatly superior force. I have been all J
through â¢ their so-called mountain
strongholds during the past few months
and there is hardly a place that cannot
be reached by Mexican troops and \
mountain artillery. ".If the Y'aquis keep
divided into one or two forces they will
be easily defeated:. If they break into
smaller bands they may cause the Gov
ernment troops much annoyance, but
their 'ultimate extermination or com- ;
plete subjection is certain to occur."
Si nor Serano â¢ said the Indians had
committed many murders and de
stroyed a large amount of valuable
property belonging to peaceable Mexi
cans before they left the valley. They
had had one engagement with a small
force of Mexican troops near the vil
lage of Onava, resulting in the defeat
of the Y'aquis, their loss in killed be
ing nine men. One Mexican soldier was j
killed and two wounded in the fights.
CONVICTS TO FIGHT YAQUIS.
Released From Mexican Prisons and
Sent to the Front.
GUAYMAS. Sonora, Mexico, Aug. 9.â -
While the major portion of the - rebellious
Yaquis are concentrated at Victim and
Bocum, where the decisive battle of the
campaign is to be fought, several ma
rauding hands are scattered throughout
the country. No one dares to leave the
towns and there exists a state of terror j
seldom equaled in the history of the State
of Sonora. All the towns along the Y'aqui
River are appealing to the Federal Gov
ernment for arms, which are being sup
plied as rapidly as possible.
A prisoner who escaped from Vlcum to
Potam says that a band of Indians
crossed the river and had gone in the di
rection of the hacienda of Guamuchil,
where the family of General Torres re
sides, for the purpose of â¢ attacking it.
The hacienda is defended by a small gar- I
rison in charge of Senor D. A. Torres and :
grave fears are entertained for the safety j
of the old veteran's family.
The Governor has ordered the release I
of tho convicts and prisoners in the Jails i
throughout the State and they are being
armed and hurried to the front to fight
the Yaquis.
Colonel Maafs of the Seventeenth Bat
talion has left for Potam with a battery !
of artillery.

AGNEWS ASYLUM IS
POLITICAL PROPERTY
What a Tote for Burns Means to
Dr. G. D, Marvin.
Governor Gage and the Mexican Colonel Use
" the State Institution to Pay Their '
Own Debts. ....-â¢ â 
PAN JOSE, Aug. 9.â Another political j
scandal has forced its murky way
through the crust In which it was t en
cased to demonstrate again the griplike >
hold Colonel Dan Burns ami '.Governor !
Gage have placed upon State institutions. J
This time it is the Agnews Insane Asylum
which has beer used to feed the insatia- i
ble* lust of these heavy handed' politicians I
In their desire to pay political debts with j
promises of easy positions that have good j
salaries attached. The entire investiga
tion that has been conducted by the j
Board of Managers at Agnews and the ]
State Lunacy Commission, although nec
essary and timely, was really inspired by
Gage and Burns for the express purpose
of placing conscienceless politicians in
the positions which they would force to j
be vacated.
Dr. G. D. Marvin of Humboldt County
figures in the plot. When the battle over
the election of a Senator raged hotly at
Sacramento early this year Dr. Marvin
held out until the last day of the term
and was then whipped into line by the
Burns influence. He voted for the Mexi
can aspirant just in time to make himself
one of the hungry horde that was tore
ceive the emoluments of its servile offices
When the distribution of favors should be
in order. Like all the other converts, Dr. j
Marvin voted for Burns merely because \
he believed in the depths of his con
science that the colonel was the man for
the place. The real inducement, how- |
ever, was a promise of the medical direc
torship Of Agnews Insane Asylum and
for this Dr. Marvin cast his ballot the
last day of the term. ...
The entire proceedings during the in- j
vestigation at Agnews point to the Influ
ence of the Governor and the man back j
->f him. By a fortuitous circumstance, the ,
sutbreaking of a scandal which demanded
the immediate consideration of the now- |
ers the opportunity was given- the Gov
ernor to make strong acclaim against the j
evils and immorality existing within the
asylum walls. His plans to reward Dr.
Marvin for the vote that didn t send
Colonel Dan to Washington were thus j
fortified by the gloss of purity and right
eons conduct. Â , . 'â â -.

jealousies and. political disquietudes are

KENNA TRIES TO

Carries a Warm Ward-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Aug. Alderman Michael
Kenna, better known among constituents
as "Hlnky Dink," keeper of several levee
saloons of the lowest type and protector
and proprietor of many gambling houses
on the leveeâ *' The Patch," "Cheyenne"
and "Hell's Half-Acre"- as the slum dis
tricts are colloquially known, has gone to
Saratoga. His colleague in the Council,
fellow-saloon keeper and partner in the
protectorate, John Coughlln (Bathhouse
John), has been in Saratoga for several
weeks, where he has been cutting a dash
that seems to have made "Hinky Dink"
envious. Coughlin appeared in the /'all
room of the United States Hotel a night
or two after his arrival arrayed in an
olive fir. en "full dress suit,' which at
trad d th- attention of society reporters
and brought Coughlln columns of adver
tising he couldn't otherwise have ob
tained with a Rockefeller bank account
behind him. it was noticed that Mr. Ken
na became very thoughtful on reading
these glowing accounts. He gathered up
the newspapers, marked each Coughlln
article carefully and took them to the

with a roulette wheel design, and other
suits and shirts that will start an epi

"Yes " said the Alderman s tailor,
speaking of Ke'nna's outfit, "the clothes
he bought were original. As to whether
they laid over those of Bathhouse 1
cannot say; that would be a matter of
individual taste. Kenna ls a smaller man
than Coughlin. and perhaps a blue dress
suit is better suited to his style of archi
tecture. Â .
"Of course, there were three or four
fancy vests. One was heliotrope, wttn gilt
buttons and yellow dots. Another was
robins-egg blue, with a green vine deli

suggested having a couple of robins paint

him, not knowing what action the humane
society might take. 'â  ". ,

The programme is to oust Dr. Sponogle,
the present medical director, and place the

was called into existence.
H. V. Morehouse, Senator from Santa
Ciara County, threw a bomb Into the Ag
news camp last evening. He represents
some of the employes who are fearful
of their jobs and in their interest has
been poring over the law books. He told
tin- Board of Managers that before any
men were discharged to make room for
others written charges had to 1"- filed
against them and an investigation held.
Morehouse contends that it is not with
in the power of the Board of Managers
or the Governor of the State to dismiss
employes unless by the routine prescribed
by law.
The. lunacy law of 1897 covers all the
conditions that might arise and limits the
power of the Governor of the State as
well. These statutes give the medical
director the helm, and there is sure to be
a conflict when the matter is brought up
for legal adjudication.
Behind the sudden and manifestly just
and timely investigation the hand of the
politician Is seen at work. It is just an
other State Institution that has bee,, put
Into the distorted stomach of Gage and
Burns.
At a meeting of the Board of Managers
yesterday afternoon Dr. Stocking, first
medical assistant, presented a communi
cation which asked for an Investigation
of the Iversen case, in which he was in
volved, by a joint commission of the
Lunacy Commissioners and the beard of
managers. This was at first granted, out
the managers suddeljr awoke to the re
alization cf their dignity and recon

other manager., voted and an Investiga

pierced his own heart was removed
from his backbone. Here was conclu
sive evidence of murder, for only one
ball had been fired from the dead man's
revolver.
A Coroner's jury was summoned, but
it was unable to bring in any verdict
of more definite character than that th"
man had been shot by some person or
persons unknown.
Remembering the loss of her ham and
biscuit, Mrs Switzler conceived the
idea that the two men whom she sus
pected of that theft were responsible
for the murder. The men she had in
mind worked at the cannery, and one of
them was John Aber, now under arrest.
The cannery paid off its help last even
ing and much of the money went into
Landis' safe in settlement for pro
visions. It is. thought probable that
the suspects had asked Landis to ac
commodate them with some articles
from his stock last night and that, once
inside, they endeavored to have hint
open the safe to make change. When
he refused the scuflle which overturned
the lamp may have taken place and
then the murder, twenty feet away, in
the store.
Mrs. Jed Reese was returning from
a friend's house about a block away
when she heard a scuffle in the direc
tion of Landis' store and she mentioned
it to a companion. This was about 10
o'clock last night. The last seen of
Landis was about half an hour before
that time, when, having concluded a
social game of billiards with some
friends, he handed Night Watchman
Redding 'a letter to be mailed. The
two pistol shots were heard by many
citizens, but it appears that at Lincoln
the report of a pistol is not such a
rarity to excite unusual curiosity. The
leading hotel of the town is a stone's
throw from Landis' store, but none of
the habitues of the place paid any at
tention to the shots, which are- de
scribed as having had a somewhat muf
fled sound.
Young Landis was unmarried, and so
far as his relatives and friends knew
he did not have an enemy.

STOPPED A RUNAWAY.
1 Fatality Averted by the Bravery of
Peter McGlynn.
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 9.â Through the
bravery and presence of mind of a young
â  man named Peter McGlynn, what would
doubtless have been a serious accident
was narrowly averted on the road be
tween here and San Anselmo to-day. As
it was. Baptiste Bottini, the. proprietor
of a resort at Fairfax, had his right leg
broken in two places and sustained inter
: nal injuries, '.'.;'.' *
Bottini's resort is well patronized
in -summer, and he has been in the
â  habit of bringing his guests into town to
â  do a little shopping once or twice a week.
: This morning he drove in a surrey to this
' city and brought with him three young
ladies. The journey here was made safe
ly, but on the return' trip a nut came off
| the axle and released a front wheel. As
' the vehicle careened th.- horse took fright
and dashed furiously down the road,
throwing Bottini out near the residence of
M. M. Tompkins. .IJ". :
The horse continued his mad career for
a quarter of a mile, with the women hold
; ing to the seats as best they could. Near
: San Anselmo there is a curve in the
; road and a deep gully at a point
where a fall would have produced
serious results. McGlynn was lead
, ing a horse down the road and saw
1 the runaway when, there was not time to
' spare if a serious accident was. to be
avoided. He let go his own animal and
through the .runaway horse stumbling,
which momentarily checked his Right, se
cured a grip on the reins, which were |
dragging on the ground. .He was drapsed
a hundred feet, but managed to bring the :

ly difficult, owing to mud and water,
which covered the country, and the in

The first troops to move were the

Colonel Bell, starting at 2 a. m. for the
railway to the west of San Fernando,
down which they marched to attack
Bacoior, which the rebels had reoccu
pied after the withdrawal of the Am

hand had been prepared and this led j
the advance. The rebels at Bacoior did j
n i offer much resistance and after a j

Almost concurrently with Colonel

guns of the Third Artillery, moved ;
toJÃihe west of the railway,
and General Wheaton. with the j

guns, moved to the east of the line.
The two guns were first dragged over,
the railway ties fay horses, and then the [
enemy, who had dug trenches, were i
shelled for a half hour. Only a slight
reply was made to the artillery fire, but ;
when the infantry advanced heavy fire
was drawn from the rebels. The lowans
and the Seventeenth regulars encoun- |
terec the trenches at long range. When j
a third of a mile away they were or- '
dered to charge and advanced at the ;

guns posted on the railway.
Simultaneously -with the advance of ';

This gave possession of San Antonio i

To-day's movement had been planned
for some time, but was delayed by
rains. Finally two days of sunshine
dried the rice fields sufficiently to per
mit the attempt. The American po
sition had long been unpleasant. The
rebel army surrounded San Fernando
and fired nightly into it. the Americans
not replying except ozi extreme provo
cation. It was necessary to keep 500
or 600 men on outpost duty constantly.
Captain Deems, with a provost guard,
last night captured a noted Filipino
faker with ' several aliases, who, by
means of ventriloquism, had persuaded
the natives that he had supernatural
powers. He raised much money, os
tensibly for the insurrection, which he
kept for himself. Our soldiers sur
rounded his house and corralled thirty
Filipinos. Many others escaped. The
troops also captured $1000. Immanuei.

The steamer Satumus of the Compa

steamer was boarded by an armed
boat's crew and the passengers were
taken off. The cargo, consisting ;of
general merchandise and $100.00"} in spe
cie had been sacked. Several-tittemnts
to" tow the Satumus off were unsuc

LINGTON HOTEL. Aug. s.â No official I
notice will be taken of the criticisms of
General Oti3 and his conduct of the j
Philippine campaign by Lieutenant
Commander P. S. St. John of the Brit- â¢
ish Royal Navy. As none of the offi- j
cials of the British Embassy are in ;
Washington, it is impossible to obtain I
an expression of opinion from that
source, but diplomats and American
naval officers agree that Lieutenant
Commander St. John has been very tn
discreet and It would not be surprising !
if. should the matter come to the at- I
tention of the British Admiralty, he I
were called upon for an explanation.
Such action, if taken, will be purely
voluntary, as it was stated by the offi- l
cials to-day that they had no intention
of making a diplomatic incident of j
some indiscreet and incorrect state
ments of a foreign officer.
As an indication of tenant Com
mander St. John's ignorance of facts, j
officials of the War Department point
out that instead of "500 1> brave and
courageous fellows" being sacrificed by j
General Otis' incompetency, the mortal- j
Ity returns show that less than 1000 i
have lost their lives in the Philippines, j
The authorities are inclined to believe
that the rest of Lieutenant Commander |
St. John's assertions are on a par with j
that regarding the number of deaths
that have occurred.

imperial limited train. He was on this
coast ten years ago on H. il. S Cor
morant, being in command cf that ves
sel when she opened the Esquimau
drydock. A naval oScer here said St.
John always had a habit of talking too
freely. He left the Cormorant, which
is now a coal hulk at Gibraltar, and
spent some years on service in the
Mediterranean, and in IS9<5 was dis
patched to the China station with H.
il. S. Peacock- He was sent to Wei-
Hai-Wei for a time and then returned
to the Peacock, on which he went to
Manila, whence he was invalided home.
He was stricken by sunstroke at Ma

condition- He has now recovered, how

pond, with gutters over a foot deep in
muddy water. Sampaloc district was
completely fiobded. so that the people
were forced into the upper stories of the

surrounded by water, and soldiers stood
guard and carried on patrol duty in two
feet of running water. Hundreds of

their baniis and boats were seen on a
dozen streets.
Admiral Watson had a narrow escape;

Much _.---- heard in Manila be- ,'
cause American silver is not received at j
the Custom-house, nor is American sold
or bank notes. The existing Custom- !
house regulations require that all cus- '
toms shali be paid in Philipnine currency.
This leaves no Â«ptlon for officials, because
as long as there is a change or Sectâ a- '
tion in the relative values of s.lii and i
silver, any otficial who accepts payment â 
in any unauthorized currency is liable to
be called upon to pay the di-ferem-e. out â â 
of his own pocket. ;-
The Pcstofl on the other hand, will \
not accept currency, which is compulsory â 
at the Custom-house, unless the stamp

WILL NOT ACCEPT THE
TIBURON BOULEVARD
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 9.â The Board of
Supervisors of Marin County, in the
language of Supervisor Mason. Is "up

has hung around that body owing to Its
failure to make a proper tax levy, and its

the result that the county general and the

other members as a body. All signified
that they so understood.
"Who understood it that way?" ask-.!
Richardson, â _.-â --- "Do you
mean that was the way the board under
stood it?" He was answered in the af
firmative, and replied: "The reason of
this misunderstanding is that 1 have been
persistently ignored in this matter. The

work being completed in accordance with

well. The three sections are 7000 feet in

these words Richardson left the
room. After a short consultation a mes
senger was hurried out to find District
Attorney Mclsaac. That official was then
questioned as to the rights of the board

matter was very strict. If the County

But Her Antagonist Encoun

S..ev:a! Dispatch to The Call. .
NEWPORT, R. L, Aug. 9.â The New-
York Yacht Club's; cruise from .'ard
iners Bay to this port to-day, a dis
tance of forty-three miles, was full of
interesting brushes. While the yachts
ran the last half of the forty-three
miles in a constantly increasing south
west breeze the flrsi half of the day
was flukey.
It is no disparagement to the Colum
bia to say that her defeat of the De
fender of over twenty-two minutes was
due more to the bad judgment and hard
hick of tin- latter boat, which left her
in a soft spot, than to actual superior
ity; still the new boat showed herself
very able in a broad reach with a con
stantly increasing breeze, and it is not
too much to say that she made an aver
age of fully thirteen knots in the run
along shore from Watch Hill to Point
Juiiith. so rapidly dropping the De
fender that when the jibed around the
whistling buoy of Point Judith her
rival was bull down to the westward,
over five miles astern. On the run up
from Point Judith, dead before the
wind, the Columbia gained a minute
or two more, so that nt the finish the
old defender had received the worst
beating in her history.
There was never a moment during the
day when there was not wind enough
to 'fill the sails, while the last fifteen
miles were sailed in a grand breeze
from the southeast that gave each boat
a great move. The day itself was per
fect, for the sky was cloudless and the
air was full of. vigor. A huge fleet of
steam yachts" watched the sailing craft
start and accompanied them over the
most of the course, and all Newport
saw the finish at Brentons Reef light
ship, the cup defender of 18P3, the Vigi
lant, leading the fleet over the line
after a warm contest with the schooner
Colonia of fifteen miles or more. At
the finish there was fifty-five seconds
between the beats, but as the Vigilant
started six minutes ahead th- Colonia
beat her easily on the run, although, of
course, the boats sailed in dilferent
classes.
The yachts started at 10:30 in a fairly
strong westerly breeze, all breaking
out spinnakers on crossing the line.
Then six or seven miles were quickly
sailed, but a half hour after the start
th.- wind began to slacken and soon
some ere almost becalmed. All dur
ing the soft spell of two hours the
Columbia seemed to be especially fa
vored, for she carried a breeze right
through and gained rapidly on the De
fender. The latter, too, made a mis
take in getting too near the Fisher
Island shore, bo that when the wind
did come around the Columbia caught
it a half- hour ahead. It was at this
time, as the boats passed the entrance
to Fisher Island Sound, that the Colum
bia made the great gain that gave her
such a lead. From Watch Hill to Point
Judith she fairly flew over the water,
with her boom well off to port and her
big balloon jib topsail drawing like a
steam engine. All the boats went well
on this reach along shore, and. looking
back, every yacht seemed fairly buried
in canvas. The homestretch of seven
miles from Point Judith to Brentons
Reef lightship was made dead before
the wind in a freshening breeze, and
the way the boats jumped along was a
caution.
The day was a grand one from 4:15
o'clock on. At that time the Defender
took in her spinnaker, the Columbia
soon following suit. Away ahead, more
than five miles in the lead, were the
Vigilant and the Colonia. The sloop
and schooner were making the hottest
fight of their career for the honor of
finishing first. For several miles they
Bailed close together, beam to beam.
Both rounded the whistling buoy off
Point Judith at 3:34, leading the fleet.
The Arctic came next at 3:43, the Co
lumbia sweeping grandly around the
buoy at 3:48:30, and the Navahoe at the
same time. The Columbia could not
overhaul and pass the Vigilant in the
seven minutes' run to the finish. Even
the Colonia was unable to do it. The
latter yacht jibed to starboard off
Narragansett and dropped astern just
a3 they both passed the old cup de
fender, Volunteer, which, with Hank
Haff at the wheel, had come out to
meet the fleet.
Smartly the crew of the Vigilant took
in her spinnaker just before reaching
the lightship. Then they Jibed her,
and like an arrow she shot across the
Colonia's bow. She crossed the finish
line just fifty-five seconds ahead of the
schooner and finished first of the fleet.
The Columbia swept across the finish
line at 4:24:20, taking in her spinnakers
a few seconds before reaching it. She
was just twenty-one minutes and three
seconds ahead of the Defender. Ac
cording to the official figures the Co
lumbia won by twenty-two minutes
and twenty-five seconds.

BUFFALO. N. V . Aug. 9.â The biggest

of George Carney, who had won two heats

and claiming the race, decided to contest
with the others, contemplating an appeal
to the beard of review if he failed to win.
The judges said they would expel him If
he did not show up and ignored the soli
tary heat business of Tuesday evening.
In the pooling there was some uncer
tainty owing to the peculiar conditions,
but Carney sold favorite. After Carney
had been beaten in a close finish by Ve

was compelled to send the bad acting Ve

With nothing in the way Carney stepped
off handily and closed the Incident.

PARKER BESTS OTTS.
DENVER. Aug. 9.â Kid Parker of
Denver defeated Billy Otts of San Fran
cisco in the fifth round of what was to
have been a twenty-round bout before
the Olympic Athletic Club to-night,
therein- "winning the lightweight cham
pionship of the West. The fight was fast
and furious from the start and after the
second round was a continuous series of
mix-ups varied by Otts going to the floor,
taking the full limit each time. Parker's
superiority in in-fighting was clearly ap
parent, he landing on Otts with upper
cuts in every mix-up. ,____,
Otts made his best showing in the first
round and for a moment looked like a
winner, sending Parker to the floor twice,
slightly dazing him once. In the second
honors were about even, but afterward
Parker had things all his own way. He
knocked Otts down twice in the third,
four times in the fourth, the bell saving
Otts, and again four times in the fifth,
when Gus Ruhlin, who was acting as
Otts' chief second, reluctantly threw up
the sponge, it being apparent that his
man was too weak to continue.
Otts claims that his left hand was
broken in the second round, to which he
attributed his inability to administer pun
ishment. The result of the fight places
Parker in line for the lightweight cham
pionship of the world, and he will at once
issue a challenge to Frank Erne, the
present champion.
In the preliminaries Jim Coonen of
Denver and Spike Wallace of California
fought a ten-round draw..

OF the many parties of sportsmen
which have left this city since the
deer season opened on the 15lh of
July, few have had success as that
headed by James Markland and Lloyd
Baton. They spent a fortnight on the
ranch of General James F. Smith, near
the boundary line of Sonoma and Mendo
cino counties, and secured all the game
they required for their camp. Mr. Eaton
photographed his companions 'in poses
classic and otherwise. The accompany

NOTES OF THE
DIAMOND BY AN
OBSERVING FAN
Good and Bad Points
of the Players.
Schmeer is beginning to play ball In hi?
oldtime form and proving his right to
be considered the premier shortstop of
the league.
Courtney is a player whose praises are
not sung very loudly, but ne is Ueldlng
and hitting as well as any man in the
league
Hammond of Oakland seems to have
fallen down in his batting.
(.roll's catch in Sunday's game was
marvelous. If Dunleavy and Strelb were
put on either side of him, what a light
ning outfield they Would make.
Brockofl fattened his batting average
in the last Oakland series.
Morrow has caught every game nut one
played by Watsonvllle this season.
McCarthy tried his hand at pitching
Sunday morning and proved that he was
no novice in the box.
It is a long time since Whelan has
pitched a winning game.
Courtney plays in and out field with
equal ability.
The fans at Santa Cruz looked on Dal
rymple'a debut last Sunday with great
favor.
The Friscos had no license to lose
Sunday's game. Four errors in 'ho fifth
by Krug, O'Nell. Muller and Hilderbrand
without a hit oft Fitz gave the Santa
Cruz aggregation two runs and the game.
Pyne is regaining his batting eye and
Is hitting as well as any one on the Fris
co team.
Kleiber seems to be an especial favorite
with the Santa Cruz public.
Hilderbrand is inclined to be somewhat
of a grandstand catcher. It mars the ef
ficiency of his work. _.__,. â,
Pitcher Harvey is hitting the ball like
a demon Three and four each game is
not a had showing for a twirler.
O'Connor seems to be making his quota
of errors around the initial Dag.
Big Hill Lang,- is laid off by the Chi
cago's without pay until he gets in good
condition, This is rather a novelty for
Bill. 'Â-.._
Donlin is getting up a team of California
players to tour the coast after the league
season is over. -.. :
In the Sporting Life of this week s is
sue appears an item stating that the St.
Louis club is seeking the services of Jim
my Sullivan for first base. When Man
ager Harris of , the local, team was asked
concerning this report he stated that he
had heard nothing regarding it. and vol
unteered the remark, while he would hate
to lose Sullivan, he would have no regret
if he bettered his condition. Regarding
Sullivan's ability, the St. Louis team
might go farther and fare worse. He
also said that Sullivan was easilj- the
best first baseman in the California
League, playing the points of the same
and covering more ground than any first
baseman in the league.
Following is the standing of the clubs:

BOXER KENNEDY IN
AN EXHIBITION BOUT
Joe Kennedy, the latest of the Califor
nia boxers to seek the wider field of the
East, will be the center of attraction at
the Excelsior Athletic Club entertainment
this evening. The exhibition will be held
in Teutonia Hall, Howard street, near
Ninth. Kennedy's last public appearance
here will be in a bout with "Spider" Kelly.
There will be something more than mere
sparring for those who like hard hitting
mixed with their boxing. "Billy Spring
field, who did some serious fighting at
Santiago, will meet Henry Lewis in a
limited round bout. Several other bouts
between promising amateurs go to make i
up an excellent card.
There Are No Gutter-ways.
Property owners on the line of Mission
street, between Crescent avenue and De
Boom tract, are taking steps to have
gutterways placed along the side of the
main roadway before the rainy season
sets in.
Some two years ago the persons own
ing real estate in this section of the city
were assessed a considerable sum for the
purpose of having cesspools put in at the
street corners which would act as water
catchers and in this way prevent the rain
water from overflowing the roadway.
These cesspools failed In their purpose
for the reason that there were no gutter
ways to conduct the overflow to the open
ings. It is to remedy this oversight and
have the street protected that has caused
the property owners to draw the attention
of the Supervisors to the error.
With this comes the further grievance
from the same property owners, all of
whom complain of the sharp practice of
the Market-street Railroad Company,
which monopoly has seized the whole sur
face of Bosworth street with its double
track, running from Mission street Into
Glen Park. The property owners assessed
themselves $3600 for the purpose of grad
ing and macadamizing Bosworth street,
and no sooner had the work been com
pleted than the Market-street company
came along and occupied the entire street
with its electric track. > i:,.,.-

A Painter's Serious Fall.
- The Receiving Hospital was again opened
yesterday and several patients were treat
ed. One of the worst cases was that
of August Linn, a painter, living at the
Park Hotel. He was painting a house on
Daisy street yesterday afternoon, when
the hook on the staging on which he stood
became unfastened and he was precipi
tated to the ground, a distance of about
forty feet. His left arm was badly frac
tured at the elbow and Dr. Heintz had,

left in the same boat.
The three men in the final made a loaf-
Ing race of it. no one desiring to cut out
the pace, Peabody was in front, with
Summersgill In second place and Caldow
trailing. They kept this position .til the
back stretch of the last round, when Cal
dow moved up and the three men came
Into the stretch practically abreast Then
it was that Summersgill let himself loose.
He got a lead of a half length and suc
ceeded in holding it from Peab >dy, who
had about the same distance the better
of Caldow, who did not finish nearly so
strongly as he did in the preliminary.
The most important professional event
was the half-mile. C. R. McCarthy of St.
Louis, Nat Butler, Carman, the Canadian
rider, McCarthy of Toronto, Major ray
lor and Angus" McLeod of Toronto jwere
the six men who got into the final. 1 ere
was a hair-raising finish between Mc-
Carthy of St. Louis and Major Taylor.
The latter got into a pocket in rounding
into the stretch and though he mad* 4 a
great rush he was beaten out by McCar
thy It was only a matter of inches, Ihe
decision was so close that a pari of the
crowd on the stand back of the wire re
fused to accept it. claiming Taylor had
won. he time was 1:00 1-5. :
In the two-mile tandem, professional, a
new world's competition mark of 3:4( 3-o
was made by the Butlers, the previous
record being 4:01 3-5, made by McDuffee
and Terrell at Boston. The men were
paced by a triplet, the Butlers coming
out at' the head of the stretch, winning
prettily from McCarthy and Bowles, with
Taylor and Casey a wheel back of them.
The half-mile amateur was won handi

ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE.
Officer WHite Exonerated From Blame
for Shooting George Cornwall.
An inquest was held yesterday by Cor
oner Hill on the body of George Cornwall,
who died in the City and County Hospital
on Monday morning from the effects of
a bullet wound received while in the Cal
ifornia-street police station on Saturday
evening. Cornwall was then partly de
mented from the use of opium and tho
effects of the drug made him desire to
kill some one. He fired a shot at Prison
Keeper H. G. White, -which struck the
officer in the breast directly over the
heart The force of the bullet was
checked to some extent by striking the
folds of the heavy uniform sleeve, but
it made a painful wound. The crazed
fellow continued to snap his weapon at
the prison keeper and other officers, and
he did not stop until checked by a bullet
fired by Officer White.
officers White, James McGovern, M. J.
O'Sullivan and L. H. Young and Patrol
Wagon Driver V. Barbette and Autopsy
Surgeon Dr. J. L. Zabala testified as to
the circumstances of the shooting, but
nothing more than has been published
was brought out in their testimony. At
the conclusion the jury found that "said
wound was inflicted by H. G. White while
acting in self-defense." Cornwall's funeral
took place yesterday afternoon at Stock
ton, where his family reside.

HOW INDIA MAY
SECURE GOLD
Opinion of Mint Di
rector Roberts.
â + â
RECOMMENDS A BOND ISSUE
â â¦-â
GOLD WILL NATURALLY FILTER |
IN VERY SLOWLY.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 9.â Commenting
on the cabled report of the Committee on â 
the Indian Currency, placing India on the |
gold basis. Director of the Mint Roberts
said -day:
"The report does little more than reaf
firm and declare the permanency of the;
[icy adopted in 1893, when the mints
were closed to the free coinage of silver.
The mints were closed originally because
the decline in silver had become so great
as to embarrass the Indian Government,
which received its revenue* in silver and
had to make a large share of its dls
bursements in gold. The Government
makes its remittances to London by sell-
Ing bills of exchange on the London
market] these being ought by people who j
desire to make the remittances to India.
Before the mints were closed the public
could either, buy these 'council bills' or!
send silver, but by closing the mints the
Government hoped to force the purchase j
Of the bills at a higher rate. Hard times I
followed in India, attributed by those who
criticized the Government to the closing j
of the mints, but attributed by the Gov
ernment to the famine and other causes.
There was considerable agitation In favor
of reopening the mints, and the business
world was In no little uncertainty about
the future. It was considered highly de
sirable that the Government's future pol- |
lev should be definitely assured, and ac- j
co'rdingly something over a year ago a
committee of eleven was appointed by the
Indian i ifflce In London to investigate
the whole subject. The committee has
published two volumes of testimony and j
now gives Its own .elusions.
'.'lt is unanimous in finding that the
mints should not be reopened to silver,
The committee says: Even apart from
considerations affecting the Government
Sof India it is not in the Interest of India
that her foreign commerce, over SO '" 'â¢'
cent of which is with gold standard coun
tries, should he tampered with by the
restoration of silver monometallism.'
"The committee pronounces the efforts
of the Government to hold the value of
the rupee at 16 pence a success, and holds
the sale of consols at that figure to be a
proof that India already has the gold
standard. It hesitates. however, to rec
ommend the final step. viz.. that the In- j
dian Government Khali give gold in ex
change for the silver rupees current. It
says that in its opinion it is not necessary
fnr the Government to bind Itself to do
this It would "impose on the Government
a liability to find gold at a moment's no
tice to an amount which â :..- be defined ;
beforehand, and the liability is one which
in out opinion ought not to be accepted.'
"This has been the puzzling question in
the Indian situation. The Government ,
has no gold reserve, nor has it the means j
to obtain a stock of gold at once. It could
only be done by the Issue of bonds or in j
Installments through taxation, and it is ,

not practicable to Increase the taxes of
India to any considerable degree. The
committee concludes that the acquirement
of a reserve may be left to the future and
that the present silver currency of India
may be maintained at a fixed value of
gold by supplying such quantities of gold
as are needed for foreign remittances.
That, they say. they 'regard as the prin
cipal use of a natural reserve.'
"In fact, that is precisely the service
performed by the gold reserve of the
Pnited States. The Indian committee re
fers to the example of the United States.
It is recommended that the Indian mints
he opened to the unrestricted coinage of
gold and that the British sovereign be
made a legal tender upon the theory that
gold will flow in as more money is need
ed anil that eventually a considerable
share of the currency will tints come to
be of gold. The significance of the port
is In the determination not to open the
mints. The policy of India may now be
assumed to be settled."
When asked if there was any reason
to expect such a movement of sold to
India as might disturb money markets
in the world's centers Mr. Roberts re
plied: "There is not. India cannot draw
any more than she can pay for, and she is
not rich enough, or likely to develop ex
ports fast enough to make her demands
serious. She has taken nine or ten million
dollars' worth of Australian gold this
year. She cannot possibly take a sum
that will absorb the Increase of this year's
gold production over last."
"Does the final adoption of the gold
standard by India have any bearing upon
our foreign trade?"
"It places the" wealth producers of both
countries on a common level," replied Mr.
Roberts, "and disposes of the old argu
ment that the Indian farmer has an ad
vantage over the American farmer, be
cause he receives his pay in a falling
currency. Whatever Intricacies there
once were on the subject have been
cleared up. for the Indian farmer, like
the American farmer, is now paid by the
gold standard. The alleged advantage
was an illusory one, for he only held it
while the currency continued to fall, .and
then only after he could work it off on
some uninformed or helpless fellow-coun
tryman at a former value. Furthermore,
in the nature of things a currency must
stop falling some rime, when it becomes [
worthless, if not sooner. This committee â 
agrees with the Indian Government that
the. interests of that country as a -whole
demand that the depreciation of Its money
should cease and that its financial system
should be linked to that of the other im
portant nations of the world."

TEDDY HARTMAN IS
PARALYZED AND POOR
TEDDY HARTMAN. the ex-Tlvoli favorite. Is sick and destitute ln New
York. Some few weeks ago Tom Leary. also of Tivoli fame, struck
the Empire City, and almost the rlrst news he heard was the unhappy
Plight of his old friend. It did not take long for the big-hearted Leary
to hunt "Teddy" up. He found the unfortunate comedian destitute
and ill, suffering with a paralysis that robbed him of all use of his lower
â¢ m -This Is no place for yon." said Tom. "This infernal heat Is" not calcu
lated to help a man along the road to recovery." and without further ado
the Hartman baggage was packed by the faithful Leary and Teddy was
installed as guest in a trim little cottage rented by Leary at a health-giving
Long Island resort. At last reports Hartman was improving, but there were
serious doubts as to his ability to reappear upon the stage for some months
to come. The comedian's sad plight has become known to his many friends
out here, and a substantial purse has been forwarded hlrn as a token of
their esteem. â¢-,..,_ ......
â Vbout two years ago Ferris Hartman left the Tivoli, where as the
comedian of the opera company he had scored numberless successes, and
decided to invest his savings in "starring" himself. He went to London, se
cured a brand-new-warranted-to-wiri comedy, ami .with a -New }ork com
pany appeared at the Baldwin Theater for. a two weeks' run.
Hartman and his play, "The Purser," won a success d'estime. The first
night was a tremendous one. but that was all. Several thousand dollars
were sunk in the Baldwin engagement, after which the company played the
northern route, dropping money all along the road. After his venture as .a
-star" the Tivoli favorite joined several Eastern organizations, but he did
not seem able to please the New York theater-goers and misfortune followed
mi-fortune. Finall% luck seemed to strike him. He got an engagement with
the Casino company; but once again 111-luck pursued him, and while playing
a prosperous engagement with "The Man in the Moon" company he was
stricken with paralysis. â â 
Tom Leary who so nobly came to his old friend's rescue, is prospering

fashionable clubs and swell gatherings.
SITUATION IN
TRANSVAAL GRAVE
Preparations Made for
Any Contingency.
Special Dlppatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 9â The gravity of the
I Transvaal situation is generally regarded
to have been increased by the latest news
and the tone of Mr. Chamberlain's
statement on the eve of the prorogation
of Parliament adversely affected prices
on the Stock Exchange, where how
ever, the prices. of South African securi
i ties are now above the worst.
In the House of Commons to-day Jo
seph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for
the Colonies, said no official .confirmation
had been received of the report that the
. Transvaal had declined to agree to a joint
I Inquiry into the effect which the fran
chise reforms will have on the Outland
i ers Several regiments, he added, were
! about to be dispatched to South Africa
for the defense of Natal, in response to
the request of the Natal' Government,
, and preparations were being, made for
any contingencies.
Later, replying to T. P. O'Connor. Irish
Nationalist, member for the Scotland di
vision of Liver] 1-. Mr. Chamberlain.dep
recated a resumption of the debate on the
Transvaal situation, which, he pointed
out While serious, still remains doubtful
The colonial secretary, added that he
sincerely hoped that the report saying the
inquiry proposal had been rejected was
untrue. While he regretted the necessity
of answering Mr. O.Connor lt would be a
fata" mistake to allow the latter s views
[hat a -was entirely needless and hat
te Government oUght to express willing
ness to wait, maybe twenty-five years
for a redressal of the grievances of which
they complained; to be considered.
He added: "The representative opinions
of even the small minority in the House
of Commons or anything but the most In
! significant minority of the United King
dom on the Governments policy have
been clearly expressed. We recognize the
grievances" of the Outlanders and have
sad that these grievances are not merely
themselves a serious cause for interpo
sition but are a source of danger to the
! whole of South Africa. We say our pre
doih nance is menaced by the action of the
Transvaal in refusing to redress the griev
ances or give consideration to requests
i hitherto put in the most moderate lan
! guage of a suzerain power. We say that
! this state of things cannot be tolerated.
! We have put our hands to the plow and
! won't draw back. With that statement
; 1 propose to rest content." ....
The additional troops ordered to be in
readiness for transportation to South
Africa include a battalion of the Grena
dier Guards and three batteries of artil
lery. Parliament was prorogued later in

proposal fo a Joint commission of inquiry
into the effect upon the Outlanders of the

MERCHANTS REACHING
OUT FOR BUSINESS
WHOLESALERS' LEAGUE WILL
BRING TRADE TO CITY.
A Series of Excursions to Be Hun
From All Points in the
Western Territory.
The executive committee of the Manu
facturers' and "Wholesalers' League, at
a meeting held yesterday in the rooms
of the Board of Trade, decided definite
ly to inaugurate a series of exclusions
to San Francisco to take in all ot the
territory west of the 100 th meridian. The
object of the undertaking is to .reinvig
orate the trade of this city. The mem
bers of the league assert that the propo
sition Is not altogether a selfish one on
their part, for they believe that it will
be of benefit to the entire business com
munity.
'1 be dates of the excursions have been
fixed as follows: September 2, from Ug
den; September 9, from El Paso; Septem
ber 16, from Portland, Or.; September 23,
from Surf. A number of local excursions
will also be arranged. The railroad com
panies have agreed tb make a half rate,
and the league will refund to all legiti
mate buyers an additional quarter. The
local hotel men and the theaters have of
fered to make a reduction from regular
rates of 25 per cent to the excursionists
upon presentation of the league's cer
tificates. -;:-""â¢'. * ..:?â¢-*'. â.___,
It is believed that the plan will bring
to this city a great number of people
who would not otherwise visit here, The
same system of stimulating trade has
been successfully tried in the Eastern
cities. Â£QT?_B-
The members of the league will com
mence to-day to send out Invitation:, to
their patrons throughout the entire West
ern territory. Over 25.'mxi of these will be
mailed and will be forwarded at the rate
of SOCIO a day.

VOLUNTEERS' Df.Y.
WHEREVER it may be discussed an assent al
most universal is given to the proposal that the
day of the reception of" the California volun
teers be made a public holiday. Hardly a dissenting
voice can be heard. It is the popular demand oi the
time. All classes unite in it. ' :\
Extensive preparations are now under way for j
making the reception one of the most brilliant festi- _
vals known to our annals. All classes of people â 
young or old. have a natural desire to take part and
share" in the welcome and in the festivities. Thou-;
â¢ands of them, however, will be. unable to do so unless j
business is suspended and the day set apart as a pub
lic holiday. Without a general closing up of shops â 
and places of business the working men and 'women
who make up the great mass of the population will
not have the full freedom enjoyed by others in wel- |
coming the volunteers and sharing in the joys of the ,
occasion.
California can well afford a holiday for such a pur
pose. We are not an idle people, and but little of our
time is given to purposes of recreation. . One more
added to the legal holidays of this year .will be no
loss to industry nor to wealth. It will entail no in
convenience to any business or trade. Even if the
legal holiday be not proclaimed th. people will be too
much occupied with the reception to attend to the
ordinary routine of work. From every point of view,
therefore, it will be better to frankly meet the popu
lar demand and make the holiday free for all.
In this connection it may be noted all indications
now point to the conclusion that the reception will
be made altogether the most brilliant and impressive
accorded to the volunteers of any State on
their return home. The committee in charge has
made preparations on an extensive scale, and as a
rule the people are responding cordially to the appeals
for contributions to the reception fund. To that fund.
F.deed, all should contribute. Let the subscriptions
be liberal and prompt We are to have a holiday. in
which all can share, and therefore all should in pro
portion to their means assist in making^ it successful
in every respect.
PEOPLE WHO TfILK TOO MUCH-
COMMANDER P. S. ST. JOHN, R. X . of
H. B. M. S. Peacock, is reported to have said j
on board R. M. S. Empress: "General Otis:
is a illy old fool- -an old womanâ utterly incompe
tent to manage the campaign which confronts him
in the Philippines, and at least 5000 brave and coura- j
gcous fellows have been sacrificed by his utter in
competency."
If that report be true then Commander St. John
must be added to the lengthening list of dignitaries j
who in these later days have been talking too much |
and too recklessly. hen Captain Cognlan turned
loose his tongue to lash the Germans we pardoned
him because he is our captain and he was lashing a
foreigner. With St. John it is different. He is a for- â¢
eigner and his fool tongue has been turned against j
one of us. What in Coghlan was but a choleric word
is in St. John rank blasphemy.
There lias been something like an epidemic of fool
talk from high tongues ever since the craze of Anglo- j
Saxon fraternization set in over the dinner parties of j.
New York and London. Even our Embassador at j
the Court of St. James, that master of diplomacy and
after-dinner rhetoric, the gifted Joseph Choate, has
been known to speak not wisely but too often under
the influence of that exuberant spirit of international I
fraternity, and as for the tongues of lesser eloquence |
that have slopped over in babbling, their name is \
legion.
It is right and fitting for the American people to
lambaste Otis when they will and as much as they will. â¢
We" have got into a bad scrape in the Philippines, and !
a scapegoat is needed. Aguinaldo will neither fight j
nor surrender, the jungles refuse to disperse, the '
rainy season will not stay away from the islands, our
troops after a glorious walkover march are always
compelled to walk back, and somebody must be held
responsible. Otis is in the right position for a gen
eral la* .basting and none can question our privilege
to give it to him. A nation is not like a railroad com
pany, and when one of its well regulated trains meets â¢
a smash-up it. does not attribute the accident to Provi
dence but condemns the engineer and demands his
...... ....
hide. . . .
Our freedom to condemn and to punish com-,
manding officer in the Philippines because the. course
of imperialism does not run smooth is, however, not I
to be conceded to foreigners. The captains of i
Britannic Peacocks have -no right to spread a lurid
tail of criticism across .the fame of an American
officer. There be limits to the privileges born of fra- j
ternity and imperial sympathies, and by exceeding j
those" limits P. S. St. John. R. X., of H. B. M. S.
Peacock, on board R. M. S." Empress, has shown !
himself to be as many kinds of an ass as there are '
initials in the names and titles of himself, his ship
and the steamer on which he did the talking.
It is to be noted, however, that this condemnation
will not count nor stand if it be shown that the com- i
mander did his talking in private conversation over j
a modicum of fraternizing spirits. .
GOGE OND BURNS REPUDIATED.
rROM the results of the primaries lessons cad 4*
drawn affecting State as well as municipal poli
tics, and one of these is of too much importance
to be overlooked. It is a lesson which teaches how
fully -and how emphatically the Republicans^ of San
Francisco repudiate the bosses who with Governor
Gage sought to elect Dan Burns to the United States
Senate.
During the session of the Legislature every Repub
lican member of the San Francisco delegation, with
but one exception, supported Burns. They were the
creatures of Kelly and Crimmins, and the two saloon
bosses were in Sacramento holding their push for
Burns and aiding Gage in trying to bring about hi,
election.
The primary election- afforded for the first time in
opportunity for Republicans of this city to manifest
their sentiment on the issue. There was a Kelly and
Crimmins ticket in the field. The Burns and Gage
push was behind it. All the San . Francisco legis
lators who voted for Burns were behind it. The
voters of the party knew those facts. They saw their
opportunity and seized it. The vote against the
bosses was overwhelming. The Kelly and Crimmins
ticket was beaten two to one.
The meaning of such a repudiation of the men
who were leaders in the effort to elect Burns to the
United States Senate cannot be mistaken. It signi
fies the repudiation of Burns as well as of the saloon
bosses who with Gage are his most potent allies.
It cannot be doubted that Republicans in ever/
part of the State would with .equal vigor repudiate
Burns if an opportunity were afforded them to do so.
Gage has openly threatened to appoint Burns to the
Senate if there should be any chance the appoint
ment would be recognized by the Senate. He has
now learned what the Republicans of San Francisco
think of the threat. That much the primaries have
made clear to the push as well as to the people.
It does not follow that Collector of the Port Jack
son is a bird because he has been so successful in
feathering his own nest.
THE OREGON BOYS.
OREGON has good reason to be proud of her
boys. San Francisco can and does bear wit
ness to their worth. During their stay in this
: city they won golden opinions from all sorts of .peo
i pie, and now that they have returned to their homes
\\c send after them the best of good wishes and the
': fullest praise for their conduct not only white in the
i service but during the brief stay they made with us |
, after being mustered out.
The straightforward conduct of the Oregons while
: i:i the service may have been due to the effectiveness
j of their discipline as soldiers, but their orderly course
! after being mustered out and paid off, exposed as they
| were to the full temptations which a large city
; offers to young men away from home, can be attrib-
I uted only to a natural nobility of character and a care
! ful home training. Oregon's volunteers, therefore,
i have borne witness not only to the patriotic valor of
i the State but to the sterling excellence of its virtue and
i the high standard of manhood inculcated in its house
| holds.
Some fears have been felt in this city that the -dis
j banding here of all the volunteers on their arrival from
! the Philippines would result in turning loose upon
'the community a large number of idle men who in-
I stead of going home would remain here to spend
i their money and thus in the end add to the unem
: ployed and probably to the dissolute idle class of- the
j city. It any such fears were ever felt, concerning the
'. Oregon men they have been dissipated. All the
j members of that regiment stood as steadfast by their
j colors after being mustered out as before, and in a
I body they left us to return to the welcome that awaits
' them at home.
The course taken by the sons of our sister State
i is another illustration of the superior character of the
I men who make up the volunteer armies that respond
' to the call of the Union. The men who are first to rally
; for the flag when war breaks out are not the vagrant
idlers and tramps of trie cities and the countryside, i
j They are the earnest young manhood of the nation.
i They fight for love of country and not for a mere love J
â¢of adventure. Their hearts are with their homes as
j well as with the banners of their regiments, and as !
I soon as they have accomplished through war an hon
; ( rable peace with victory they gladly lay down their
j arms, and return modestly to the work they left un
finished in their offices, their shops and their farms.
Oregon, we repeat, can welcome her boys:, with a
' just pride. They have reflected honor upon her in
'â¢ peace as in war, out of service as well as in it. They
I were good soldiers in the Philippines, good men in
; San Francisco, and gentlemen at all times. They
I have been faithful to the best aspirations of Oregon
! homes, and merit every honor the proud State they
| love can bestow upon them.

THE PARCELS POST.
BY reason of the good results of the parcels post
between the United States and various countries
of South America, Mexico and the West In
dies, a strong desire has arisen in ' the commercial
cities of the East for an extension of the system to all
countries with which we have any considerable
dealings.
In reviewing the subject the New York Tribune
points out that while in dealing with the ' countries
with which we have a low parcels post rate we are on
equal terms with Great Britain, yet when it comes to
the larger commercial countries of the world we arc
at a disadvantage. It says: "For carrying a two
pound package the postage to Australia and New
Zealand is 36 cents English and 95 cents American.
'I'm Hongkong the. rates are respectively 32 and 95
cents; to Cape Town, 36 cents and $1 25; to Berlin,
24 and 70 cents; to Paris, 32 and 75 cents; to Brussels,
30 and 95 cent.-, and to Milan, 40 cents and $1 15. So
it is seen that the American rate is from 120 to 250
per cent higher- than the English, and. unfortunately,
foreign express rates on small packages are not such
as to compensate for the postal deficiencies."
The need of a cheap rate of postage for foreign
parcels is unquestionable, but the agitation for it
should 'be made to include a cheap parcels post for
domestic as well as for foreign service. At the pres
ent time a three-pound package can be sent to
Colombia for 36 cents, and an eleven-pound package
costs $1 32. If the Government can carry such par
cels at those prices to foreign countries, why should
it not carry equally large parcels for the domestic
business of our own country?
The Tribune says: "Sentiment here has generally
THE SAX FBANCISCO CALL,, THURSDAY, AUGUST 10, 1399.
been in favor of giving the largest scope to private en
j terprise and setting the Government at no work which
VTDfiid*be .otherwise performed. The express com
â  panics, having taken into their own hands the small
I parcels business while the letter postage system was
I yet in its infancy, did the work so well, so much better
I than any similar service is performed in Europe, that
, there has been little disposition to cut their business
: in two by diverting the small parcels traffic to the
postoffice."
That statement may be true of past conditions, but
it is not true of conditions now. The express com
: panics no longer give satisfaction in the carrying of
small parcels. On the contrary, from one side of the
country to the other there is complaint against them.
They are extortionate; they discriminate against small
shippers to the unjust advantage of richer rivals: they
shirk taxes, and in many other ways carry on their
] business in a manner injurious to the community.
The Government, for the convenience of the pub
lic, took out -of the hands of bankers the work of
transmitting small sums of money from one part of
the- country to the other and conferred an immense
benefit upon the people by .the establishment of a
money order department of the postal service. It
i might now with an equal wisdom extend the opera
' tion of the parcels post and make it as useful within,
| the United States as for the foreign countries, and
â¢ thus derive a profit from a traffic now in the hands of
j corporations that shirk even the slight taxes laid upon
: them for the needs of the nation in time of war.
THE FORESTS AND THE SOIL
A A R. JAMES McLEAN has addressed to Sec- j
' / \ retary Wilson an open letter containing aj
* considerable amount of information gathered !
om virions sources concerning the effects in Gali- j
lee, Russia, and elsewhere of the destruction' of for- j
ests". The subject is one of vast concern to the peo- |
ple of the United States, for our own forests have now
been destroyed to the danger limit, and it is well that
intelligent men should give heed to what the inevit
able consequences will be.
The ruin of Galilee occurred so long ago it is dif
j ficult to impress men of our time with the lesson it j
: teaches. The steady sweep of desolation over the
j plains of Russia, however, is going on in our own
time, and even the most heedless can hardly be inat
tentive to it.
Famine follows famine with alarming rapidity in
I parts of Russia which were once fertile and flourish- i
ing, and the cause is the blight brought about by the
destruction of forests. Mr. McLean quotes from a
writer upon the "Penury of Russia." in the Edin
burgh Review, the following impressive statement of \
â  the cause of the penury:
"Owing to the destruction of the forests the rivers
I are drying up, and the eastern part of the country is
literally being sanded up. The ruthless forest.de
. struction which has been going on for a long time
: has had a serious effect in reducing the average rain- j
fall. The belts of wood attracted and held ' the
: moisture, which was slowly distributed for the bene
fit of agriculture; now, - in vast regions, as, for -in
stance, on the black soil, there is hardly a tree to be !
seen.* and the consequence is that- the underground
rivulets which nourished the soil have disappeared.
The forests also broke the force of the fierce east
.desert winds. Now these winds, piercingly cold in
winter and scorchingly hot in summer, burst with
full fury on the great plains. In summer'thcir blasts
are capable of withering the corn in a few day-, and
with them come sandstorms which turn fertile, land j
into permanent deserts. The unfortunate experience j
of Central Asia, which once was a garden of fertility '
and now is a desert peopled by nomads only, is re- j
peating itself."
It is a hard saying to predict that the bountiful !
and profuse soil of California may yet be as desolate
as the once fertile plain- of Central Asia, and yet it
is certain such fate will befall them if the wasting of i
â â  the forests goes on in the future as in the/ past. We
destroy forests much more rapidly than the people :
of any other country, or of any other, age, for we
have brought to the work a host of mechanical inven
tions to aid in the cutting and the wasting. More- j
over, we are perhaps more careless and reckless in
starting forest fires than any other people. As a con
sequence, the desolation which ages were required to
bring about in Russia may be wrought in California j
within two or three generations.
It is indeed impossible to overestimate the value
of forests, for without them no land is tit for human i
habitation! American intelligence is heeded! to put
1 a check upon American waste, greed and careless- i
ness in the destruction of woods. If that check be i
! not applied with sufficient promptness and with suffi
cient force, the future of this country will be a repe
tition of what is now going on in Russia. There will
be penury and families for a time, then the stricken
populations will move away, and over vast regions
of this country, as in Central Asia, there will be no I
human habitations except the tents of the nomadic i
i tribes that wander from place to place in search of :
| water and pasture.
rROM the New York Times we learn that a good
many postmasters in the East have failed to
notify persons seeking to mail packages to the
Yukon district that such mail cannot be carried, and
accordingly Third Assistant Postmaster General Mad
den has found it necessary to issue an order calling
the attention of postmasters throughout the country
to the fact that while letters and postal cards can be
sent through the mails to the Yukon territory, there
is no way .by which parcels or third or fourth class
mail of any kind can be forwarded.
It is desirable to have this matter understood by
the public as well as by the postmasters, as a con
siderable number of persons address parcels of third
or fourth class mail to points along the Yukon and
drop them in the mail boxes without consulting the
postoffice officials on the subject.
There would be little complaint against the Govern
ment for not carrying third and fourth class mail if
it would carry letters with due diligence and care,
but it docs not. The failure of the mail service
throughout the Yukon region -has been a disgrace to
both the United States and Canada. Men- and even
women having but scanty outfits have made the jour
ney in arfd out across the passes from Dyea and
Skaguay'to Dawson at all seasons and during all
months of the year.- and yet the mail contractors
have been permitted to neglect their work in every
thing except drawing down â¢the money that should
not have been paid them. .
The whole Yukon -district has .now. become the
scene of considerable industria' and commercial ac
tivity. Thousands of people arc there and thousands
in every part of the United States have large interests
there. It is therefore a duty on the part of the Gov
ernment to supply that country with an adequate mail
service. â¢Where private citizens, many of them far
from rich, can carry in tons of food and heavy im
plements-and machinery it ought to be possible for
Governments so powerful as those, of the United
States and Canada to carry a few mail bags full of let
ters and postal cards
MAIL FOR THE YUKQN.
AN AUTOMOBILE ELEPHANT
CLEANS THE STREETS OF CHICAGO
It Runs by Electricity and Picks Up the Dirt With- Its
Trunk.
CHICAGO has a very odd sort of street cleaner. It ls an elephantâ not a flesh
and blood affair but an automobile animal.
It looks just like the real creature, though, and It ambles about the
streets picking up papers, sticks and other debris, trumpeting with apparent
delight when doing the hardest and most uncleanly labor, says the New York
Journal. ' â¢â â 'â â â  - - ... ...
Tony Gronendyke, a Chicago electrician and inventive genius, has built this
remarkable automobile animal. He is now' engaged in testing his elephant for the
Chicago Street Cleaning Department
The flrst Idea of the inventor was to perfect a machine that would pick up
and carry away the paper, sticks and general debris that collect in the streets,
and the test mad.- a week ago in Ashland avenue, Chicago, was as good as a
circus performance. - -
The battery and machinery by which the elephant was propelled, as well as
the apparatus "by which it was able to do the most astonishing things, are hidden
away behind the dull sides of the monster machine, that is made entirely of steel,
colored to resemble the hide of the animaL
The work is performed entirely by the trunk, which is made by hundreds of
steel hands linked together, giving it a strength and suppleness equal if not su
perior to the proboscis of the living animal. Within the head is a great auto
matic bellows. When the engineer, who sits in the saddle, or howdah, sees a
piece of paper, a stone or stick in the street he pulls one of the small handles
that are ranged around the howdah and the proboscis swings out toward the
obieet This sets the bellows In action, a suction is created which sweeps the
obstacle into the mouth of the trunk and carries it into the interior of the ele
phant, where lt is deposited. , ._,___, _, _v
Touching another handle, the apparatus is reset, the trunk folds up under the
tusks and everything is ready for a second attack. It is astonishing how rapidly
articles are picked up under the skillful manipulation of the engineer.
The street for two blocks was cleaned thoroughly in exactly seventeen min
utes and thirty-eight seconds. The engineer then ran the elephant three miles
west where the accumulation was dumped on a vacant lot and burned, those who
had been Invited to witness the test following as best they could on their bicycles.
The dumping process is very simple and is all done by the engineer from his
place in the howdah. A slight pull on one of the little handles and the whole
[owe part of the elephant swings open and the load of paper, sticks and stones
falls to the ground The elephant is then made to rear up on his hind feet, swing
around clear of the debris and then,. settling down again on all fours, he goes
rocking away at whatever speed the engineer desires. *.:.â 
When at work the elephant makes scarcely any noise, but moves silently and
gracefully wherever the engineer wishes him to go. When he is filled to his
capacity 'he trumpets automatically.

A MUTINY ON

and Elwell Arrive from x

Captain William Fordyce of the British
ship Falls of Halladale, which left here
for Taeoma in March last to load lumber
for Cape Town, had a lively voyage of it
to South Africa. The ship is now in
Delagoa Bay, discharging, and in a let
ter received in this city yesterday Cap
tain Fordyce tells of his experence. While
the Falls of Halladale was being towed
to sea the crew mutinied. Men were
scarce at Taeoma and they had been put
aboard by the boarding masters with the
understanding that they were to be taken
off again before the ship sailed. They
went before the captain in a body and
swore they had been shanghaied. The
ship was then under .way, and as the
captain would not pay any heed to their
complaint the men refused to work. Cap
tain Fordyce did not argue the point
with the men, but going below armed
himself with two revolvers. For five
hours he paced the deck with one of these
in each hand, and finally got sail on the
After the tug had cast off the Falls of
Halladale and the vessel was well clear
of Cape Flattery the men went to work
without a murmur. The next accident
happened to the mate. A big sea washed
him into the scuppers, breaking his col
larbone and dislocating his shoulder.
Then four of the crew were laid up and
a succession of gales kept the rest of the
men on deck night and day. In spue of
all this the run was made to tape town
in the splendid time of ninety days. From
South Africa the Falls of Halladale will
go to Australia and then come to this
port withm load of coal. ' _-_-__Â«
The steamer Gaelic left for the Orient
yesterday afternoon at 1 o'clock sharp,
and the Moana sailed for Australia
shortly before midnight.- Both vessels
stop at Honolulu and there will prob
j ably be a test of speed on the way down.
! The Gaelic is a fast steameY but the
! Moana has never been thoroughly tested.
I She is in flrst-class condition, and Chief
Stevedore Olsen sent her away in splen-
I did trim for making good time. Captain
Carey dots not expect to make up the
: Gaelic's lead, but he does expect to beat
I her time to Honolulu. .
The Moana took away an unusually
' heavy cargo. In it were books, boots and
i shoes canned goods of all kinds, bicycles,
freÂ«h'and dried fruit, machinery, brooms
! and broom corn and a carriage and a case
of books for King George of Tonga. His
â¢Majesty has lately taken unto himself a
wife, and the books and carriage are
probably a present for his consort. Be
i sides all these goods, the Moana had on
'. board over 10,000 cases of onions. At this
time of the year onions are very scarce in
Australia and New Zealand, so it pays
i well to ship them from here.
Among the passengers who went away
on the Moana was Lieutenant Philip An
drews, U. S. N. He is going to Honolulu
i to marry Miss Clara Fuller, daughter of
Captain Fuller, harbor master of Hono
lulu. Lieutenant and Mrs. Andrews will
return to San Francisco on the Alameda.
The Gaelic took away quite a number of
i passengers. Among them was Mr. Nugent
i and wife. Just before sailing time the
I friends of the couple sent them down a
| beautiful floral piece. It was a represen-
I tation of the Gaelic made with flowers
1 and ferns and was an excellent likeness
of the steamer.
The Harbor Hospital will in future be
run by Drs. yon der Lieth, Himmelsbach.
Niemeyer and Cherry, and Misses Turner
and Shelton will continue to act as nurses.
! For the time being the ambulance will
â  remain at the hospital and Messrs. Lily
and Kelly will continue as drivers. A
more competent staff than this could not
j be found in California, and it is a pity the
city cannot see its way to putting the
I Institution on a paying basis. An emer
gency hospital is a necessity on the water
front and great credit is due the physi
cians and nurses for keeping the place
open.
The ships -Florence and Elwell arrived
from Newcastle. N. S. W., yesterday.

and made 'the run to port in sixty-four
days, while the Elwell crossed it in 164
west and took seventy-five days to make
I the voyage. The Elwell had an uneventful
passage, while the Florence was caught in
a heavy easterly gale on June 22, which
lasted "forty-eight hours, and on June 23
was supplied with fruit and vegetables
by the natives of Crohr Island. Both
ships are -coal laden.

M. J. Barry, a brother of Bailiff Barry
of Judge' Mogan's court, had an-unpleas
ant experience at an early hour yester
day morning. He was walking home to
his" room at 23.Â°. O'Farrell street shortly
after 1 o'clock when he was accosted by
a young woman, who mistook him for his
brother, as they -hear a striking resem
blance -to each other. He walked along
with her for a short distance and left her.
Just as he was about to enter the Stew
art House to go to his room a young
man ran out of the doorway and slashed
him on the cheek. Two other men came
out of the doorway and one of them re
marking, "That's the fellow that .was
with the two girls in No. 19," slashed him
across the chin. . Barry was carried to his
room and a physician summoned, who at-'
tended to his wounds.
Two of the men were later identified as
William Denning, bookkeeper at the Stew
art House, and John Bechter, a surveyor,
of 511 O'Farrell street. The third was a
soldier. *
yesterday warrants were sworn out for
the arrest of the three on the charge of
assault with a deadly weapon and Den
ning was arrested yesterday afternoon.
Denning said his trouble was with Barry's
[ brother and he denied using a knife.

REGIME IN POLITICS
Republicans Administer a Sharp Rebuke
to. Gage and Burns.
Gavin McNab in Full Control of the Democratic
Works-Rainey Controlling Only* One Hun
dred Delegates in a Minority-Kelly
and Crimmins Overthrown.
The overthrow of the bosses at the
primary polls day before yesterday was
very nearly complete. The suit as given
by the revised figures is the same as that
announced in The Call yesterday morn
lng. The Republican League elects 200
and the County Committee faction elects
106 delegates to comprise -he Republican
Municipal Nominating Convention. As
the enrollment of voters in the clubs or
ganized under the auspices of the County-
Committee was almost equal to the num
ber of votes cast by the party last Tues
day, therp can be no doubt that many of
The Republicans so enrolled voted accord
ing to their individual judgment as to the
merit of the tickets presented. The party
lash has no terror for Republicans in a
local campaign and a boss must be gifted
with brains and tact to exercise any wide
reaching control of Republican party af
fairs. .
Crimmins and Kelly never cut much of
a figure as bosses. Since the days of
Hisgins the Republicans have had no boss
of superior strategy. Higgins possessed
managing ability equal to that displayed
by Gavin McNab in the recent campaign
for the control of the Democratic works,
lie gained â¢ the confidence of the party
leaders and gave the orators counsel a_3
t-"> the line of policy to be followed in
public speaking.
Republicans of the Central League â the
followers of Henry T. Scott and Z. U.
LÂ»'idge â whose work in the overthrow of
Crimmins and Kelly was so well done,
must soon accept new responsibilities. They
will be charged with the duty of selecting
a county committee for the government of
the party, and when that* work is done
they will tie the regulars.
Tne people expect that the convention
chosen under the auspices of the Repub
lic..:! League will put forward the best
men ever nominated for office in San
Fran Cisco. The man at the head of the
ticket â the nominee for Mayor â should be
able in bring all Republicans into line.
There is a strong current of sentiment
in the Central Republican League in
favor of Horace Davis for Mayor. Mr.
Davis is recommended by his friends as
a man of exemplary character, a citizen
t: recognized prominence, a man clean in
public ar.d private life. The convention
may not bestow the nomination on Mr.
Davis, but it should nominate a man of
his typeâ a citizen above reproach. At
the outset it may be stated that The Call
has no candidate.' It has no favors to
. ask of the convention of any political
party; and will not support a boss-tainted
or railroad-programmed nominee even if
such a man should _ be nominated by one
or aU of the conventions, lt has no more
respect for a be-ss in the yellow building
than for a boss in the barroom. In the
overthrow of the boss regime the Re
publicans of Son Francisco administered
a sharp rebuke to Governor Gage. It is
a fact known to all that Kelly and â  'rim
mins and their coterie were out and out
supporters of Burns for the United States
Senate at Sacramento during the entire
session of the Legislature. It is a fact
also significant that Henry' T. Scott,
president of the league which downed the
bosses, is a brother of If ving M- Scott,
who was a candidate for the United
States Senate in opposition to Burns.
Last Tuesday, was the first opportunity
s-ince then of the Republicans of San
Francisco to express their opinion of
bosses, and they expressed it in a fashion
which should convince the Governor that
fcos=es and bo^s methods will not be tol
erated hy the party.
The Democratic besses were badly de
moralized by the election last Tuesday.
Buckley, as well as the Rainey-Examiner
combine, was swamped. The Bulletin,
which champions the cause of Mayor
Pr.Man and Gavin McNab, thus comments
en the plight of the Examiner:
"The Examiner formed a combination
with R.iiney and also lost. The stable
boss, encouraged and shielded by the Ex
aminer, was beaten nearly three to one
by the blind boss, fought by the Ex
aminer."
R.iiney is disfigured, but in the parlance
of the prize fighter is "still in the ring:."
He controls Vif delegates in the Demo
cratic convention-elect ar.d will be- able
to protect the Fire Department and Fome
of his fric-r.ds and political associates.
Mere than two-thirds of the delegates
elect, however, acknowledge .".liegiar.ce to
the Committee of On" .Hundred and rec
ognize the superior leadershio of Gavin
McNab. Henceforth Mr. McNab will di
rect affairs in the Democratic house-hold.
His advice will be sought and his counsel
accepted in the seiecticn of a county com
mittee to govern party affairs. lie did
not go to ------ in the recent primary
election, but sat in his office in the Mills
buildir.g and planned the campaign which
resulted so disastrously to ua'ney and
the -Examiner. He did hot for an instant
<":oubt the result of the battle. When
Buckley was most confident ar.d the Rai

honest judgment of the people belonging
to tbe Democratic party and predicted

The Examiner had special reasons for j
Its anxiety to control the Democratic lo- |
cal convention. The delegates comprising j
this convention will select the county com
mittee and it will be the duty of Demo
crats comprising this committee to pro
vide for the selection of delegates to
State or district conventions, upon whom
will devolve the duty of electing delegates
to the National Democratic Convention.
The Examiner desires a national delega
tion that Hearst can swing. As Gavin
McNab is in control of the works he will
no doubt give careful attention to the
duty of selecting men for the county com
mittee ir. order that untrammeled Demo
crats may be chosen to represent the
Democracy of California in the national
convent) a- Mr. McNab's health is
improving he is able to devote some of
his time to public duties.
It may be readily surmised that Mr.
McNab in handling the reins of the Dem
ocratic party . HI so direct affairs that
Mayor Phelan's ambition for a place- in
the" I'nited States Senate will receive due
consideration. That ambition cannot well
be grarfied until the Democrats elect a
majority of the Legislature.
The Citizens' Republican party, which
polled more than 3 por cent of the votes
cast at the last general election and by
reason of that party strength was per
mitted to put a ticket in the field for dele
gates to a nominating convention, polled
only 20S \*otes. lt appears that several
voters other than the nominees came to
the rescue of the party. This accounts for
the fact that the number voting slightly
exceeds the number running tor office.
The Citizens' publican party represents
the political following of ex-Boss Burns.
The People's party cast 59 votes and the
Socialist Labor party COS. The highest
vote. 20,205, was cast by the Democrats.
The Republicans polled' 11.299 vote*.
The official c.unt shows that the I wen
ty-ninth District did not give its entire
delegation to Buckle: and Rain, y. Jo
seph Piunkett and James J. Matter, on the
ticket of the Committee of one Hundred,
were -elected.
In the ------- District Gallagher's :
ticket was elected, but Gallagher himself
was snowed under. Sixteen of the candi
dates on the Hassett-Gallaghcr ticket
were elected. On the rival ticket,- man
aged by Bert Schiesinger, seven candi
dates, among them Schiesinger. were
chosen. Judge Wallace received 561 votes,
but that number was not sufficient to
elect.
A fierce battle was waged between the
Republican factions in the Forty-third
District. The loss of general officers in
the regular Republican ranks was unusu
ally heavy. Among the slain are General
R. H. Warfield and General S. \V. Pack
us. In battle it often happens that the
bravest fall the first.
The conventions to which delegates
were electrd at last Tuesday's primary
are. according to the â¢â >- primary law,
to be held at least thin days next pre
ceding the election. Usually it has b-=en
the custom to call county conventions
some fifty or sixty days prior to elec
tion in order to give that body plenty of
time to deliberate, and. after the con
vention has adjourned; to let the county
committee have ample time to make
changes and rectify existing errors, if
there be any.
The conventions are called at dates set j
by the chairmen of the county commit
tees of the respective parties, and. as is
the case in the coming convent Jas- j
per McDonald., chairman of the mo- .
cratic County Committee, will call the
convention which the Phelan delegates!
control, while the Republican convention
will be called by A. J. Raisch, chairman j

THE WOMAN IN BLACK
ARRESTED FOR BURGLARY
AN HOTEL thief known as the "Woman In Black" was arrested Tues
day night at the Hotel Stewart by Policeman Joy and taken to the
City Prison, where she was pat in "the tanks." She was yesterday
booked on the charge of burglary, and pave her name as Mrs. Ray
Mills. She is the widow of a well-known newspaper man. who died
from consumption about three years ago. After his death she turned to mor
phine as a solace. for her grief, and it was to satisfy, her craving for the

Her thefts were first brought? to 'he attention of the police In January
last. She dressed in somber black and quietly entered one of the private
hotels .luring the dinner hour and robbed the rooms of money and jewelry.
Every effort was made by the police to capture her, and for weeks a po
liceman in plain clothes would be stationed at one of the hotels, but she was
wary and kept away. July 31 she visited the Hotel Lenox, and Attorney
Frank Kelly saw her enter.. She divined that he was watching her. and in
stead of going upstairs turned round and walked away. Kelly followed her
and jaw her enter the Florence House, on Ellis and Powell streets, where
she lived.
Monday night she visited the Hotel Stewart. Ellis and Leavenworth
streets, and after she had left one of the guests discovered that her room
had been entered and some articles stolen. Instructions were given that
on her next appearance the police should at once be notified. She returned
Tuesday night, and the elevator boy Who saw her at once telephoned to
police headquarters. No detective was on hand, but Captain Seymour sent
Policeman Joy, who arrested her as she was leaving the room of Charles L.
Gorham. who" is employed in the Mint. She had taken a purse containing a
small sura of money in Use shape of new coins, which Gorham identified.
When searched a number of skeleton keys were found in her pockets. She
was taken before Captain Seymour and pleaded to be allowed to go to her
room in the Florence House, but her request was not granted.
Policeman Joy, accompanied by Detective Ed Gibson, went to her room
and found on ton of the bureau a loaded revolver, a steel "jimmy," several
skeleton keys and several bottles of morphine. She is 35 years of
age and shows the effect of the drug upon her system. Guests in the
Hotels Stewart, Bertellng, Lenox and Pleasanton identified her in the prison

TWO OF OSGOOD'S
WIVES TELL HOW
HE WOOED THEM
Blonde and Brunette
Spouses Appear.
Three of the four wives of Bigamist Os
good appeared In Judge Slogan's court
yesterday, all handsome women, doing
credit to the much-married man's taste.
Osgood started out on his reckless
matrimonial career with dashing and j
dark Nellie Kinsella. For variety's sake
he chose a blonde, Mary Bourne Winn,
for No. 2. and wound up with the hand- 1
somest of the lot. a magnificent creamy
skinned brown-eyed divorcee. Tillie Alice
Glover, whom he made No. 4. Wife No. i
and wife No. 1 were on the stand yester- ;
i day, No. 2 flashing scornful glances at
the man whose name she bore for three
short months and No. 1 beaming softly
upon him and speaking his name in
caressing tones. When the court made
the order thai all witnesses be excluded
from the room, wife No. 1 and wife No. 2
paired off together to the witness room,
while No. 4 sought seclusion in the
Judge's chambers.
Mrs. Glover, who in the parlance of the
Police Court, is known as wife No. 4. says
-. ...... . . the bigamist, that he is a
man. .-:' honor and that he will stand by
him to the end. no matter how bitter it
may be.
"it he is found guilty," she said, "the
most they can do is to send him to San
Quentln. Whet: he comes out I'll be ready
to receive him. Together we will live
down this shame, and I'll show the world
what a good woman's influence can ac
complish."
Although Mrs. Glover professes sym
pathy for the women who preceded her
in Osgood's aPfCtions, she lays all the
blame for the bigamist's miserable plight
on them. Accoiding to Mrs. Glover, Os
good was their dupe. "They were com
mon women." she said. "Osgood fell in
with them. Each in turn declared to him
thai association with him had forever
blasted their lives and happiness, and ne
in bis great noble-hearted way married
them to repair the wrong they respec
tively claimed he had done them.
"\\ hen he married me ne confessed
that never before had he met a true
woman" and my noble womanhood en
nobled him. The night he was arrested
far snatching the coat from the tailors
apprentice be had a premonition that his
many marriages wouid nnd htm out and
.... frankly revealed ail his past 111 to
me He was always kind and good and
respectful to me. Even now he doe.- not
want me to come' near the prison or pO
-â ;,.,. court, for it pains him to see me In
those places. 1 cannot forget his love for
me i love him In spite of ill, and will
stand by him to the end." _._-._.,
Loretta Kinsella, sister of Osgood s

he had been married to an actres-j uy the
name of Carrie Dickenson. I tried after
ward to find the Dickenson woman, but
was net successful, and I discovers.! that
there was no such woman I lived with

DRAGGING ITS WEARY WAY.
The "Brick" McPherson Conspiracy
Has Another Hearing Before
Judge Treadwell.
Judge Treadwell expressed his deter
mination yesterday afternoon to get at
the bottom of the "Brick McPherson con
spiracy, but he mad" very little headway.
The case of "Brick," who was discharged
on habeas corpus proceedings, is still on
the Judge's calendar, as he has not been
officially notified of the decision of Judge
Dunne, and "Brick" was not in court yes
terday, but Attorney Harvey Brown
promised faithfully to have him before
the Judge to-day.
The case of Thomas Clisham. charged
with obtaining $150 from Attorney I. N.
Thorns, was then called. Thorne took the
stand and told in a hesitating way that
angered the Judge how Clisham had got
the money from him and the representa
tions he had made.
The Judge remarked that he could not
understand how an attorney should get
an innocent woman (referring to Mrs.
Carroll) into such a deal, and thought the
Grand Jury should take up the whole
matter. The further hearing in the case
was continued till to-day-
THE END OF
HIS VOYAGE
THROUGH LIFE
Funeral of the Late
Captain Goodall.
The funeral of the late Captain Charles
Goodall took place yesterday afternoon
from the Simpson Memorial Church, cor
ner Hayes and Buchanan streets. In
keeping with the life and character of the
de. -eased the services were simple in the
extreme. The auditorium of the church
was crowded with the sorrowing relatives
and friends of deceased. In accordance
with the request of the relatives there
were but few floral offerings.
Rev. Dr. Stephens, pastor of the church,
conducted the funeral services. Seated
with him behind the pulpit were. Rev. XV.
S. Evans of Stockton. Dr. Dills of Oak
land. Rev. XV. S. Matthews. Rev. Charles
E. Locke of the Central Church. Rev. Dr.
J. D. Hammond and Rev. Dr. M. C.
Briggs. all of whom had been lifelong
friends of the deceased.
Dr. Stephens spoke in the most touching
terms of the life and character of Cap
tain Goodall, and so pathetic were his
remarks that nearly every one in the.
church was moved to tears. In closing
he sailed upon Senator George C. Perkins,
the business associate of the deceased, to
pay a final tribute to his memory. The
Senator was visibly affected by the sor
rowful duty that devolved upon him. His
voice trembled with emotion, and several j
times during the course of his eulogy he
was forced to stop -while he wiped away
the tears that he could not suppress.
Senator Perkins said: \
"Here are the last earthly remains of
a friend -whose place in my life can never
be filled. Captain Goodall was a friend
of friends and he has made his last voy
age over life's seas. By his death every
lover of true humanity has lost a friend; I
the church has lost a friend.
. "It Is as natural to die as to live, but j
it is hard for us who remain behind to
fully realize our loss. We must find con
solation, in the fact that our loss is his i
eternal gain. I have been intimately
associated with Captain Goodall in a
social and a business way 'for more than
twenty-seven years, and I would feel
that I was not doing my duty if I did
not pay this tribute to one of the noblest
men that was ever born."
The speaker then briefly told of the life
of the deceased, and continuing said:
"The brightest pages in the history of
this State will record the life of Captain
Onodallâ a life which furnishes an ex
ample that every man can follow with
profit to himself. and the community in
which he lives. The captain was true
and faithful to every trust that was im
posed upon him; he would have been a
Gladstone if he had been a statesman.
Life with film was more than a precept.
He judged men not by what they pro
fessed, but by what they were. He was
identified with everything calculated to
uplift morality and social life. He was
a charitable man, and many have re
ceived of his bounty. If all whom he
had benefited could place a flower on
his bier it would raise a monument as I
high as the steeple of this church. A :
friend has departed; he cannot come back :
to us", but the time will come when we
can go to him.'
The honorary pall-bearers were: Robert
McElroy, Captain Andrew Nelson. Sen
ator George C. Perkins. Alexander Dickie.
Mowbray Dundas. Frank Cosgrove and
Captains Johnson. Howard and Wallace
of the Goodall-Perkins steamers. The in
terment was at Mountain View Cemetery,
Oakland, and was private.

last year 4.555.015 ounces of gold and
nearly 40,000 ton* of coal. -.

Bethel A. iff. E. Church. Taxed to Its !

The thirty-second annual session of the
California Conference of the Afro-Amer
ican Methodist Episcopal Church con- !
vened yesterday morning at the Bethel
African M. E. Church, corner Powell and
Jacks streets.. Bishop Wesley John
Games presided. Delegates from the twen
ty-one colored congregations through.
out the State were present and ; to
gether with the members of the local
congregations .hey taxed the spacious
church to its utmost capacity. The con
ference was opened with devotional ex
orcises which were conducted by Bishop
Games. The Rev. Dr. Evans, pastor of
the M. E. Church of Stockton, led with
a touching prayer, after which the con- :
ference elected the Rev. W. B. Anderson
secretary and the Rev. E. T. Hubbard
statistician. Mayor Phelan was then in
troduced and made a brief address of
welcome in behalf of the citizens of this j
city.
The Rev. Dr. Evans followed the Mayor '
and delivered an oration which brought
forth considerable applause. He took oc
casion to pay a warm tribute to the mem
ory of Abraham Lincoln and Fred Doug-
lass, who In life had been patrons and
benefactors of the colored race. The Rev.
Dr. Locke, pastor of the Central M. E.
Church, delivered a brief speech and .was. i

I EASTERN MARKETS
L . 1
New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, Aug 9. There was not much ;
of a stock market to-day. The market sold j
off at the opening on realizing and on the j
heavy tone Imparted by sympathy with Lon- j
don. Sales of securities for London account !
continued to-day on a moderate scale.' The I
call money rate in London nevertheless dropi>ed :
a fraction to-day and sterling exchange in
Paris advanced, but in Berlin declined < There
is a renewal of anxiety over the Transvaal
question, which had Its effect In foreign stocS
markets and was a factor in th" reflected
early depression here. But the local market
resisted this downward tendency and was In- '
clined to move upward before the end of the
first hour under the lead of Sugar and in
sympathy with an additional rise in the Min
neapolis and St. Louis stocks. Consolidated
Gas was strong and American Tobacco forged
upward again. its gain reaching nearly three
points and holding, well near the top. Sugar
weakened before the day was over, but there
were enough Individual stocks showing strength
to maintain a pretty firm tone, notwithstand
ing the Intense dullness of the rest of the day.
Some of the gains were Oregon Navigation,!
41 â¢â¢ pacific, ("oast. 2, and Reading and Chicago]
and --'astern Illinois. 1% each; General Electric
and Colorado Fuel, a point each. At. -bison
preferred advanced strongly In the late deal
ln The call money rates were easier to-day un
der the influence of orders from out-of-town
source*. Chicago. Duluth, Minneapolis and St
Paul were said to be lending money here and
expression* of opinion from financial author!- j
ties In Chicago as to the plentitude of money I
there had a reassuring effect. While Chicago
is buying commercial paper In New lork ,
country banks throughout the West are said j
to be buying paper In Chicago. The rates for
l" loans and for commercial paper were, how- -
e"r very firmly held in spite of the easier ;
tendency in call loan departments Gold im
ports have up to to-day seemed the only re
source against money stringency here in case
cf Urge demand in the interior for moving ;
;L__ *To d-Ty's movement of sterling exchange ;
was therefore highly important as pleating
the easier condition there. The presentation |
of drafts on the New York sub-treasury In I
payment of the gold deposited at the San ]
Francisco Mint, is expected to be an Important !
factor in relieving the local money market.
Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf bonds I
dropped 4 per cent to-day in sympathy with
the reaction of 2% in the stock. The market
otherwise was dull and Irregular. Total sales,
par value, $1,033,1
lnited States bunds were unchanged in the
bid price.

CHICAGO, Aug. 9.â Aided by an entirely un- j
looked-for advance of %<s%d In the Liverpool j
market and by some bullish domestic news I
which started strong at an advance of about :
I %c. September opened at .6S%@6S%c. During
: the first hour there was considerable buying
| by outsiders through commission houses and ;
i covering by local shorts. September advanced
steadily to 63% c before the turning point was
reached. Besides the strength at Liverpool |
buyers had small receipts to help them. A j
good many reports came in from the Northwest I
of heavy rains retarding the ripening of wheat !
and harvesting operations. Some complaints :
of unsatisfactory threshing returns were re
ceived. The cash demand showed signs of im- I
provement, bids for hard winter being %c bet- |
ter than yesterday in some cases. There was j
1 the usual amount of realizing on the advance, j
: and a reaction during the morning carried the ;
I price back to 68% c, but 'during the afternoon |
the market again became strong and most of |
I the original advance was recovered. Snow's '
crop report estimated a drop of about 5 per
cent In the Government report to-morrow on
the condition of spring wheat. This would sug
gest a crop of about 257,000.000 bushels. Shorts
covered quite generally and the market showed
considerable strength. September advanced to
69%ftK9%c, but reacted to 69% con profit-taking,
where 11 closed. v. .'
Corn was strong and quite active In sym- |
pathy with wheat. September closed %c higher.
Oats were strong and better from the start.
September gained %c.
Provisions were erratic. The market opened
steady and unchanged. Sympathy with the
grain markets and natural reaction from Tues
j day's decline caused a good advance during the
morning, but there was a general selling move
ment on the rally, and during the afternoon
prices tended steadily downward. Packers were
free sellers. The cash demand for meats was
poor. At the close September pork was 7%@10c
lower, lard 5@7%c lower, and ribs about un
changed.

BOSTON. Aug. 9.â The American Wool and
Cotton Re.Kirter to-morrow will say:
There ls a quieter tone to the wool .market,
! although the volume of sales reported shows
| up quite large, being close to 7,000,000 pounds.
i A' considerable portion of this business, how
-1 ever, was really accepted some time previous
to the week under review, but the transactions
were not given out until this week. Some
houses report 'a fair demand from some, of the
smaller mills, which will probably continue
now for some time, as they were late coming
' into the market.
The situation as far as prices are concerned
! is is strong as ever. As to the total stocks of
i wool in the United State? it is doubtful If they
. have been as light since the McKinley tariff
i law was in operation.
The sales for the week in Â»ton amounted
! to 6,686,000 pounds domestic and 205,000 pounds
' foreign, making a total of 6,891,000, against a.
I total of 6,439,600 fOr the previous week and a
I total of 3,339,000 for the corresponding week
, last year.
: Sales since January 1. 1599, amount to 170.3.1,

' WHEATâ Chicago was firmer on better for
i eign advices, though the market was inactive.
'â â  Buying was fair. Receipts in the Northwest
i diminished. Advices all agreed that harvest
I returns were' disappointing. Too much rain
j there has cut down the yield. The outside mar
' kets were generally stronger than Chicago, and
long wheat was well held everywhere.
' There were heavy rains in the Corn belt, ex
cept in Kansas: Cash Corn was very strong,
and small country offerings and the short In
terest caused strength in September deliveries.
The local Wheat market showed no further
decline, and futures were slightly higher.

HUNDREDS OF
JURYMEN WILL
BE NECESSARY
All Spectators Ask
Separate Trials.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 9.
It will require 260 jurors in the Police
Court to decide the cases of the alleged
prize-fighters and the alleged spectators.
This was decided to-day before Judge
Smith, and In order to get rid of the many
cases on the calendar he fixed the trials
for all hours of the morning, afternoon
and night from August 13 to August 19.
On each of these days there will be sep
arate jury* trials at 8:30 a. m., 10:30 a m.,
: p. m.. 3 p. m.. 6 p. m. arid 8 p. m.
The circus commenced this morning,
when Attorneys Lin Church and Garrity
appeared for about a. score of the male
factors and pleaded not guilty for each of
them. Judge Smith said that In cases of
defendants demanding separate jury trials
the bail would he doubled. This provoked
a discussion with the attorneys, who said
the court had no right to practically im
pose a hardship on a defendant because
he took advantage of his legal rights.
The Judge said this was not his view of
It, but he did so because in case of default
after a jury had been suhpenaed the bail
at present deposited would not satisfy the
expenses of the court.
There is no doubt that some serious mis
takes were made in swearing to the war
rants. H. E. Alden. a real estate man,
declares positively he was not within a
mile of the light, yet his name appears on
the list. Charles -k. a young printer,
who never patronizes such kind of sport.
has also been mixed tip in the affair, but
he is able to prove that he was not even
in the city at the time of the Hunt. It
now transpires that the warrant was for
Charles Bock and had no reference to
Bock.
Attorney Bradley, who appeared for
Bock. wanted the case tried right away,
saying that it would not require one min
ute to prove that his client was not at
the fight.
Many of the defendants also declared
their ability to prove instantly their in
nocence. There was no police officer in
the basement â at least, no officer has yet
acknowledged being thereâ and therefore
the only proof possible will be that of the
spectators or of the principals, who can
hardly be expected to testify against each
other, as they would thereby be directly
and positively incriminating themselves,
Judge Smith is of the opinion that it
will not be necessary to try all the cases
or to use 252 jurors. With few, exceptions
the evidence will be the same In each case,
and It is possible that a stipulation may
he made by which one case can cove:
about a dozen. This morning one of the
defendants. C. H. R. Ledgett, did not ap
pear, and his bail was forfeited. To-mor
row Bottle-holder Permien will be sen
tenced, he having pleaded guilty, and on
the 30th Timekeeper Green, who also
pleaded guilty, will know his punishment.
Since the arrests have caused the prize
fight to become matter of common gossip
it has become known that the affair was
Dlanned very thoroughly and that scores
of people received invitations to be pres
ent. There seems to have been no secret
about the preparations and it is regarded
as peculiar 'hat some of the police officers
who must have heard of It aid not make
a re.port to headquarters In advance of the
light. ____________________________________

CHINESE TO APPEAR AT
CAKEWALK CARNIVAL
OAKLAND. Aug. The most amus
ing feature of the Oakland Cakewalk Car
nival, which opens August 16 at the Ex
position building, will be the grotesque
cakewalkers and the Chinese participants.
They were greatly appreciated at the re
cent cakewalk carnival, under the same
management, in San Francisco. The task
of teaching Chinese citizens to disport
themselves in the merry whirls of the
up-to-date cakewalk, is not an easy one.
The method pursued is to place a Cau
casian in charge of each separate Mon
golian and bj the aid of vigorous talking
and efforts the Chipaman is made t.i un
derstand something of the art. His ca
vorting, when on the floor, to the rag
time music is decidedly amusing. There
will be three or four couples of Chinese
cakewalkers in this carnival.
There will be a meeting in San Fran
cisco tins week of the lion. Chmies L.
Patton. General YVartield, Attorney Gen
eral Ford. Hon. J. A. Filcher and the
other members of the California Soldier
Boys' Fund, together with Managers
Buckley and Leonhardt. to see about the
disposal of the $506 which was derived as
a benefit in part from the San Francisco
Intt-rnations.l Cakewalk Carnival. Some
favor turning it over to the finance com
mittee on the reception of the First Cali
fornia Regiment. The original intention
of the managers, who so generously do
nated their portion of the receipts, was
to have the nucleus of a very consider.
able amount of money to be raised for the
relief of honorably discharged sick sol
diers and. to aid the unemployed soldiers
to find employment. However, the man
agers are willing to bow to the wishes of
the majority of the gentlemen who acted
on the board. The management lias also
tendered a port of the receipts here to
the reception fund.
TO PREACH FROM AN â¢
AUTOMOBILE PULPIT
Novel Project of a Berkeley Evangel
ist Who Will Tour the
State.
BERKELEY. Aug:. 9.â The automobile
craze seems to have affected the local
clergymen of the university town, as one
of their number has just announced his
intention of using the nt-w horseless car
riage as a mean? for winning souls. The
minister in question is Rev. A. S. Parsons
of .1311 Shattuck avenue. Denomination
ally he is connected with the Congrega
tional church and has labored as an itin
erant evangelist for a number of years.
From the celebrity which The Call's
automobile trip from New York to San
Francisco is gaining, Mr. Parsons thinks
that a similar scheme, planned to cover
a large section of the counties of the
State, might prove an effective means of
attracting listeners to hear the gospel
preached. With his object ... view, he
has ordered one of the machines to be
constructed in San Francisco;* and will
start out on his trip within three or four
weeks.
The carriage lias b<=en designed to carry
about tÂ»n persons, as the automobile
party is to consist of the minister, his
wife" and seven children, the eldest of
whom is 17 years of age. The journey has
be-en arranged to last about five months, :
during which the* evangelist and his party
will visit all the important cities in. th" ;
southern part of the State, stopping to
preach at towns and villages on the way.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 10, 1899,
VAST SUM OF
MONEY READY
FOR SPENDING
x
Congress Was Not at
All Stingy.
â # â
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 9.
The sum of $350,000 is lying idle at the
National Treasury. As soon as the squab
bling over the estuary improvements is
completed this money can be spent on
the harbor. This statement Is made on
the authority of Major Heuer, the United
States engineer in charge of the work.
Great as is the sum which is ready for
Immediate use on the harbor. Jit.".. will
shortly be added to it. according to the ;
terms of the act of Congress under which
it was granted. Three ears ago Congress -
appropriated $650,000 on the continuous
contract -.stem for the Improvement of
Oakland harbor, "according to the orig
inal plans" These plans are those of
Colonel Mendell, which were prepared
many years ago and which call for the j
construction of he tidal canal at the
extreme east end of the estuary. Oak
land I as always demanded that this end
of tin harbor shall be thoroughly deep
ened nd Improved first, while Alameda,
mainly through its ex-Health Officer Dr. |
McLean, has always contended that the !
original plans of Colonel Mendell were the
proper ones and that they should be car
ried out with the money made available.
Alameda laid out some years ago an !
extensive sewer system. which has tor
its foundation the completion of the tidal
canal, so that there would be a rise and
fall of the tide at the sewer outlet twice
a day The canal was commenced, one ,
expensive bridge was built across it. and
then the seemingly Interminable squabble
commenced and work was delayed.
The Govern engineers are now try
ing to arrange satisfactorily to all con
cerned for only two bridges across the \
proposed tidal canal instead of three.
There are three thoroughfares leading
across what will be the canal after It Is j
cut. but the Government does not see
the necessity of using three bridges, i
There is, however, some legal question ;
regarding the rights of way in which the
Government, private owners and the :
Board of Supervisors are parties in inter- i
est. ["his is the cause of the present tie
up of the work on the tidal canal. In I
the meantime several Oakland people are
interested in trying to have some of the I
money spent deepening the harbor at
once. " These conflicts have proved a posi
tive setback to all contemplated improve
ments, and when matt are adjusted on
a practical basis and work can be carried
on nearly the whole of the $650,000 will be I
available, whereas it was the intent of
Congress to have spent It at the rate of
one-fourth for each of the four preceding
years. , . :
Matters could have been partly settled
before this had the Government engineer
possessed the authority to use his dis
cretion But he cannot go outside the
exact wording of the act granting the ap
propriation, and therefore the canal pro
ject must be carried on if any of the
money be spent unless the next Congress
shall amend the act and authorize,
changes.
At the office of Major Heuer. chief of j
Cnited States engineers in San Francisco, |
to-day bids were opened for the construe- â 
tion of a bridge across the tidal canal
at Hi. street. "''he bids were: Darby
Layd <Sr Co.. $33,700; Pundon Bridge
Company; $21,864: California Bridge Com
pany $24.7.7. Healy, Tlbbetts & Co., I
$29 393- H. Krusi. $25.:>.93; Pacific Construc
tion Company, $28-997; Thomas Thomp- j
son. $31.4?0; Cotton Bros., $32,900.
The bid Of the Dundon Bridge ''"m- j
pany is the lowest. The propositions
will be gone over carefully before the
contract is awarded. This may take |
two or three days. All were San Fran- j
cisco contractors except Cotton Bros. of j
Oakland.
MURDERER REVEALED
TO HER IN A DREAM
Sensation Created by Mrs. Thorn
ton. Accused of Killing Har
Husband.
CARTHAGENA. Mo., Aug. 9.--Mrs.
John Thornton, who has been under ar
rest in this city for several days for the
murder of her husband, John Thornton,
a mining engineer, has created a sensa
tion â - - , .
She reported to Sheriff Nate Smith of
Jasper County that she had had a dream
in which her murdered husband appeared
before her. and when she asked. 'Tan you
tell who murdered youâ me out of this
trouble?" it was revealed to her that
George Roy, her cousin, had committed
the deed. Sheriff Smith, thinking perhaps
that Mrs. Thornton's suspicions might
prove correct, placed Roy under arrest.
Roy to-day confessed to the crime, say
ing he and Thornton had* been at outs for
some time and he killed him in cold
blood. Roy presents a sickly aspect, and !
is evidently in the' last stages of con
sumption.

cussion in its pages of questions of gen
eral interest. The first copy will appear
on September 8.

TURNED OFF THE GAS.
TOO LATE AND DIED
APPEARANCES indicate that Charles Hartwlg was accidentally as
phyxiated last Tuesday night, although the fact that he had been out
of employment tor some time and had failed to obtain remittances from
his relatives in Germany would, if isolated, be ground for believing
that he committed suicide.
At half-pa 9 o'clvck yesterday morning Mrs. M. F. Claymore, landlady
of the house 412 Leavenworth street, noticed a strong odor of gas proceeding
from Hartwig's room. Falling to open his door, she went to the rear.
climbed to the window.- broke a pane of glass and entered the room. She
saw Hartwig's dead body attired in a nightgown lying on the floor between
his bed and the window. The room was full of the fumes of Illuminating
gas. ten to her surprise the gas stopcock was closed.
The gas jet w.a n little ben.tt? the couch on which Hartwig slept and
the stopcock was very loose. A touch could turn it either way, and the
theory is that Hartwig accidentally turned on the gas after he had turned
it off just before retiring, that he was awakened by the suffocating odor.
turned it off and started to raise the window when he was overcome by the
fumes and fell to the floor where he was asphyxiated.
Hartwig always slept with the window closed, and when Landlady Clay
ton opened it yesterday morning she found that Hartwig had hung his
socks on the sill to dry and had shut the window down upon them to pre
vent them from being blown away.
Only 80 cents was found in the possession of the dead man. He had
worked in this city for a while as bartender, but had been out of employ
ment for several weeks. He had well-to-do relatives in Germany, his father,
Franz Hartwig, residing in Hamburg, from which place he had sent until
recently small monthly remittances to his son.
The dead man was 36 years old. An inquest will be held.
ACROSS THE UNION
HE CAME TO MEET
HIS SOLDIER SON
EX-MAYOR STRONG of New York. j
<^-rp T the Palace Hotel, awaiting the
homecoming Hotel, son from the
homecoming of a son from the
Ifâ A\ v-ars. is XX. 1.. Strong. ex-Mayor
H v, of New York and one of the weal
thiest and most prominent finan
ciers of that rich city. He arrived yester
day morning on the Oregon train from
Portland, and will remain until the War
ren the vessel on which his son Is return
ing! comes Into port. She is expected
either the latter part of this week or the
first of next.
Mr. Strong's son is Major Putnam
Strong, who went out to Manila at the
breaking out of hostilities with the Span
ish. He was on the staff of the command
ing general and remained throughout
all the Spanish as well as the Tagalo
trouble, winning for himself honor and
distinction for meritorious service per
formed both in camp and field.
Mr Strong, who was elected to the
mayoralty of New York for the term of
1894-97 is a gentleman of wide influence
and great power in his native State.
Though the position of Mayor is the only
public office he has ever- held, yet he is
recognized as a good part of the power
behind the throne, and there are few of
the big political movements in which his
hand is not made manifest. ââ,,,_-
Sneaking of the probabilities of Roose
velt as our next President Mr. Strong
said he thought that Roosevelt was out 0
the race for several reasons, the principal
one of which was the fact that Mr. Roose
velt himself did not desire the officeâ at
least not now. The election of that gen
tleman to the Governorship of New York
was the result of the enthusiasm engen
dered by his record while in Cuba. A
re-election of Roosevelt to the same office
will be an indorsement by the People of
New York of his policy and of the ad
ministration of his record as the head
and from of the greatest State govern
ment in the Union. This is what Mr.
Roosevelt wants and this is what in all
likelihood he will '.'.
As to expansion, Mr. Strong says that
throughout the entire East there is .1
strong sentiment in favor of retaining
all we have hold of, at least until we re
store some sort of law and order in the
territory we have acquired by the valor
of our troops and the fortune of war.
Traveling with Mr. Strong are his wife
and Mr. and Mrs. Albert R. Shattuck.
The party intend going home by the way
of the Yellowstone Park if the Warren
arrives in time to permit of Mr. Strong
making this trip and getting home in
time to attend to some important busi
ness concerns that need his attention.
Deserted His Family.
Officer "Wadham of the Society for the
Protection of Children is endeavoring to
locate Frank Valiant, a Portland barber.
A week ago he sent his wife and four
little children, ranging from sixteen
months to six years, to this city promis
ing to join them immediately. The fam
ily is now destitute. Wadham communi
cated with the Portland police and found
that the fellow skipped out to parts un
known as soon as he got rid of his fam
ily. The children have been provided for
by the society. _
At Wallasey. England, three boys from
Hoylake were ordered to be birched by
the court for stealing tour pounds of
nails and placing them on a bridge over
which hundreds of cyclers passed. Doz
ens of punctures occurred, and the boys,
who confessed their guilt, were found be
hind a hedge near the bridge, whence
they commanded a good . view of their
victims.
THE FRAWLEY
COM PANY IN
COMEDY VEIN
MICHELET says of the elder
Dumas that his quantity of
mind was out of all proportion
to Its quality; Andrew Lang
tells us that many books signed
by him might be neglected without loss;
our reading convinces us that he was a
master hand at portraying the fictitious
adventures of historical characters, and
common sense advises us that plot and
plan Of "A Fairy Godmother" most inad
equately represent him as an author and
give Mr. Clinton Stuart but little oppor
tunity to use his ability as a playwright,
if the play were not SO pretentious we
might call it a farce, for its lack of seri
ous intention condemns it as such, but
the bubble of a good farce is lost In a
certain heaviness of line and situation
that intrudes itself, in more or less
vagrant mood, throughout the play. In
modern setting, and without historical
weight, it would make a jolly, frothy
farce-comedy, but in its present condi
tion it is neither one thing nor the other
and seems to have no reason for stopping
at the fourth act. It might as well go
r'ght on so long as the characters live.
1- arces may lack a heart Interest and
thrive, but romantic comedies never,
and "A Fairy Godmother" has no heart
Interest whatever. I use the much
abused word "romantic" because the
author does, failing the while to see its
application, for a costume play is not of
necessity -â¢ title. The love scenes, save
one, are entirely flippant and there is not
an incident that makes one lean forward
in his chair. This is said in sorrow, for
there is bright dialogue, a beautiful scene
and some good acting going to waste on
mourned. The prettiest bit In the play
is the firs, scene between Yvonne and
Charlotte, and promises so much that the
after disappointment Is the keener. Miss
Bates is a very talented young woman
and singularly fitted for the role of
Yvonne, but she plays it all at the top
of her spirits and gives no hint of light
and shade. She has the tendercst cadences
in her voice and we have seen her do quiet
passages most artistically, but it would
seem as though she gave us her best (she
does not believe it her best) grudgingly.
It is just this being quiet and not using
superfluous gesture that will one day. if
she give heed to it, lift her many steps
hleher on the ridge of fame.
She has a beautiful silvery laugh, musi
cal as a bell when she wills it so. but
she gives it to us so generously that we
cease to appreciate It at its value. She
should be delicately chary in the use of
so rare a treasure. Finally and without
qualification her articulation is absolute
ly clean, clear, vibrant and intelligent.
She should play Rosalind well, but she
SELECTED TO AWARD
THE PARIS DIPLOMAS
AT the age of 29 to be appointed
as one of the three men chosen
from the whole United States
to pass judgment on the relative
merits of the different horticultural,
vltleultural and mining exhibits of
the entire world at the Paris Ex
position is something of an honor.
Yet this is just what has come
to T. H. Ramsay, the manager of the
Vina ranch, and the best of it is he
has no political Influence or "pull" to
thank for it. He is merely a country
lad who has devoted his energy and
intellect to the cultivation of the vine
and the fig tree, and his appointment
has been offered him because the
Parts Commissioners think he is the
best qualified man in the State to
fill the position, which will pay him
about $1000 in salary.
If Mr. Ramsay accepts, as no doubt
he will, he will be obliged to go to
Paris and remain three months in the
spring and summer of 1900, in which
length of time. It is expected, he will
be able to get through the work of
awarding the prizes.
Mr. Ramsay is a son of Charles
Ramsay, a pioneer who settled in So
lano, where he planted the first'
orchard and vineyard that was ever
started, in the State, and where the
present Commissioner was born in 1569.
Young Mr. Ramsay, after passing through the ordinary schooling, en- *
tered upon the care of the ranch property left him by the death of his '?
father. Thence he went to take care of the Jones Hazelwood farm In San *
Mateo, where he remained until the time he left to accept the management ,â¢â >
of the famous Vina ranch. The Paris position will not interfere with Irs Â»
present one, as the Stanford estate will keep the place open for him until his _.
return from his judgment of fruit in the gay Parisian capital. . , ,|

if she will, and that is. give them a few |
lessons in French accent. Their fluency |
of French tongue is not remarkable and j
how they shall pronounce the words I
I when they meet them seems at present
to be "like a lament to the law eh.ii'- :

i rather than decided. Three fine plays are j
I offered next weekâ "As You Like It."
I "London Assurance" and Ibsen's "Hedda

for giving us this opportunity and not

CAPTAIN BURTIS AND
HIS MATE SUSPENDED
FOR LETTING THE WEEOTT GO
UPON THE ROCKS.
Compasses Had Not Been Swung to
Ascertain Their Deviation From
the True North in This
Latitude.
Captain Bolles and Bulger, United
States Inspectors of Steam Vessels, ren- ;
dered ._:â â â  yesterday In the matter j
of the damage to the coast steamer j
Weeott. which struck upon a rock be
tw.pn Stillwater Cove and Salt Point, J
: Cal.. on July 12 of this year. The vessel j
was damaged to the extent of 5250.
In rendering their opinion the Inspec- .
tors laid stress upon the testimony of
Captain S. H. Burtis. to the effect that
he had no deviation card; nor had the j
Weeott been swung for deviation since
the deck around the pilot house had been
built He testified, also, that the polar'S {
was out of order, and that he was de
pendent upon the course steered between
Point Bonita and Point Reyes; soring the
land for correcting his compasses on the
trip
The Inspectors found that Captain P. j
IH. Burtis had been negligent nd unskill
ful in not getting the deviation of the i
compasses before he left San Francisco,
especially as there was a large quantity j
:of iron on the deck. He could have easily
I obtained the variation, as the United
â  States Government has established mag- ,
i netic ranges for determining the devia
tion of the compasses on the bay of San
i Francisco. The captain was also negli
gent In leaving the vessel in charge of
the chief mate, who was not familiar
! with the coast, and in not ordering the i
i mate to send for or call him at a certain .
! time. - ,
Mate E. G. Rouse was censured for not :
I calling the master sooner than he did ;
when he first saw the land, and for not
putting the helm to starboard and head- j
ing the vessel off shore. _ _ _
The captain's license was suspended for '
two months and the mate's license for
four months.
COURT NOTES.
Winifred Morton, a colored woman liv
ing In Gercke alley; Frank Shelton. her
landlord, also colored, and Ignaeio Cruse,
an Italian, afforded considerable amuse
ment to- the habitues of Judge Mogan's
court yesterday by recounting their tales
of woo. Shelton was accused of hitting
Mrs. Morton with a cane and Cruse with
throwing rocks at her. Shelton retal
iated by accusing Mrs. Morton of throw
ing a cuspidor, water pitcher and rocks
at him. The trouble was over Mrs. Mor
ton's dogs and cats. The Judge, after
listening patiently for an hour to th^ir
stories, reserved his decision till to-day.
Joseph Dondero, representative of the
Committep of One Hundred in the Forty
fourth District at th*! primary election,
and James Demartini. representative of
the . lineyites, who had a fight, appeared
before Judge Mogan yesterday and after
hearing both sides of the story the Judge
dismissed both cases.
Alfred Barletta, a tinsmith living at
Â£..'-â¢ Broadway: celebrated his birthday
Tuesday by sitting at the open window of
his parlor with a hatchet in one hand
and using his other hand to throw pieces
of coal at pedestrians. His wife and three
children were in Judge Mogan's court
yesterday and when the Judge convicted
hint of disturbing the peace they set up
a howl. The Judge continued the case
for sentence till to-day. and Barietta will
likely be let off with a reprimand.
XX.' M. Grogen, a soldier belonging to
the Fourteenth Infantry, appeared before
Judge Graham yesterday on a charge of
battery upon Ah Kee. a porter for Gold
berg. Bowen & Co. About 7 o'clock yes
terday morning Grogen, who was drunk,
knocked Ah Kee down, and explained to
the Judge that he thought the Chinese
was a Filipino, and as he was going to
fight the Filipinos he thought there was
no harm in what he had done. The
Judge talked to him severely, and he went
down on his knees and begged ror mercy.
The Judge convicted him, but suspended
sentence for thirty days.
Detective McMahon secured a warrant
in Judge Graham's court yesterday for
the arrest of l.nm Sang, who murdered
Ah Gum, a Chinese woman, on July 25.
The detective expects to have the mur
derer under arrest soon.

Description of the Church and Its
Handsome Appointments.
Costly Gifts by Par
ishioners.
On Sunday morning next the handsome
new edifice of the Church of the Holy
Cross will be dedicated to the service of
God with the most solemn __erer_icnies.
His Grace the Most Reverend Archbishop
Rlordan will inaugurate the ceremonies
of dedication at 10:30 o'clock. Immediately
after they are concluded a solemn high
mass will be sung in the presence of the
Archbishop in cope and miter. Rev. E.
HOLY CROSS CHURCH AND PASTOR, REV. J. F. McGINTY
A. Kelly of Chicago, a classmate of
Father John F. McGlnty pastor of the
church, will be the celebrant of the
mass. The deacon of the mass will bo
John E. Cottle of St. Brig l's, and the
sub-deacon Rev. John P. Coyle of the
Star of the Sea. The deacons of honor
to his Grace will be Rev. Father Lagan
of Sacred Heart and 1.-" P. Cummings
of St. Patrick's. Ihe first master of cere
monies will be Rev. P. E. Mulligan, sec
retary to the Archbishop, and Rev. Rob
ert Sampson, curate of Holy Cross, will
be second master of ceremonies.
Right Rev. Bishop Montgompry of I.- -
Angeles, another classmate of the pastor,
is to preach the sermon of dedication. Th.
morning services â¢will conclude with the
pontifical sslng from the Archbishop.
In the evening solemn vespers will be

and the services will clo^e with the solemn
benediction of the Most Blessed Sacra
ment. A special musical programme will
be rendered at both services by an aug
mented, choir, under the directum of Mr.
Brown. -; . :
- The completion of the magnificent
structure is the crowning work of its en
ergetic and popular pastor. Father Mc-
Ginty. The new church is said to have
cost nearly $50,000. and judging by its
beauty and appointments that sum has
been "judiciously expended. The interior
decorations are not complete, the. walls
havin~ been left bare, until there Is
enougl. money in the church's coffers to
permit their being frescoed, but despite
this fact the inside of the sacred edifice
is made beautiful by reason of its artistic
arrangements: Stained glass windows on
either side of the church allow the sun
light to stream into the edifice; marble
pillars that do not intercept the gaze of
the congregation and are attractive by
reason of their workmanship and mate
ria]; a handsome bronze and onyx rail
ing, which divides the sanctuary* from
the body of the church; chandeliers elab
orate in their manufacture,' and the
church furniture itsei'. help to add com
fort and beauty to the interior.
The church is in possession of the beau
tiful sanctuary lamp â¢ which won the
prize at the World's Fair, the gift of Miss
Morgan, a member of the parish. . Tho
-lx magnificent candelabra which are to
stand on the top shelf of the altar are in
keeping with the altar railing, and were
donated by a gentleman who wishes to
perpetuate the memory of his wife, but
does not want his name published. The
stations of the cross are handsome in
their workmanship and were donated by
John XV. McDonald.
A. temporary wooden altar will soon
give wav to a beautiful marble one, which
was especially made in Carrara, Italy,
and will be shipped here shortly. A splen
did pulpit, marie of onyx and brass, in
keeping with the altar rail, was present
ed to the church by Mr. and Mrs. James
McOlnty, brother and sister-in-law of the
pastor. The four statues on the side al
tars were donated by Mrs. John Barrett,
Mrs. James Regan. Miss Haynes and a
friend who wishes her name kept secret.
The gifts will not be ready in time for
the dedication and their places must be
filled on that occasion by borrowed and
inferior statues. â . .
The stained-glass windows on either
side of the church were presented by
parishioners. The "Flight of the- Holy
Family Into Egypt" was the gift of W.
J. Biggv; "St. Aloysios" was donated by
Mr. and Mrs. James Coughlan; "Adora
tion of the Magi." by a. friend: "St. Mich
ael," by the Misses Dwiney; "Sacred
Heart," by . Miss Winnie Duffy; "Im
maculate Conception." by the Sodality;
"St. Patrick," by Miss Mollie Shovlin;
"The Agony in the Garden." by Mrs.
Catherine Lindt; "The Savior Delivering
the Keys to Peter," by John Grant. A
handsome baptismal font was presented
by Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Nolan, in memory
of their son.
As the church now stands It costs in the
neighborhood of ISMM. It was erected ,
from the plans of Frank Shea, the- well
known local _._c__U_2ct_._Â«_lt is- panose
of the cflrrgi'egation* to' spend $10,000 more
in decoration and later put in an organ
which will cost JSOOO. '

Washington street from Montgomery ay- j
enue to the bay is gaining headway all
along the- line in the Monteomery-avenue j
district. The latest backer of the scheme ,
is George Newhall, president of the Fer- j
ries and Presidio Railway Company. Mr. j
Newhall announced yesterday that if the j
street were widened he would convert all
or a greater portion of his present cable
system Into an electric pad. _ â __ 1
The scheme as laid before the Board or t
Supervisors is to widen Washington street
twenty feet, the property to be condemned
on the south side of the street. This
would give a street seventy feet wide |
from the end of Montgomery avenue to |
the water front and would be the only
sufficient channel of trade to the bay in
the business district. Among the prop-
e>rtv owners who have signed the petition j
are' the Montgomery block. D. Ghirardelli.

CALIFORNIANS HEADED HOME.
BIG SALE
EXPECTED
Auction of Boxes and
Seats at the
Orpheum.
It Costs Nothing to Attend
It and Get Strictly in
the Swim.
The auction sale of boxes and choice
seats for the benefit of the California
Volunteers will begin promptly at noon
to-day at the Orpheum. A short and
snappy entertainment will precede the
main "event. Every possible arrangement
has been made for the seating, of the vast
crowd expected and they are promised an
afternoon's pleasure absolutely free of
cost. Don't forget that.
Almost as elaborate preparation has
been made for the reception of the public
at this sale as has been i upended so far
on the benefit proper. First of all It has
been arranged as a sort of dress affairâ
not full dress, just full enough. The
Mayor will be there to receive the patri
otic public bent on loosening its purse
strings and such others as may drop in
to lend eclatâ or something like itâto the
occasion. Assisting his Honor will be
.1 bevy of bewitching stage beauties, -who
will mask their designs on the audience
behind parapets of smiles. You've heard
of them all and admired their photo
graphs, if vou 'don't know them. Now s
your chance to get up closer. Here's the
beauty list to date: Edna Wallace Hop
per. Catherine Grey; Blanche Bates. Mar
garet Anglin. Alice Neilson. Florence
Roberts Edith Ma-son; Anna i.ieht^r,
'Louise Thorndvke Boucicault; Mary an
' Huren . Delia Stacey, Mary Linek. iiattie
Belle Ladd. Juliet Crosby. Helen Henry,
May Buckley; Irene Everett! Mrs. Ernes
tine Kreling. Mrs. John Morrisey and
Beth Frankiyn. .Numerous others will un
doubtedly be present.
The Orpheum doors will be thrown open
to the public at 11:30 lock this morn
ing. The theatrical managers will be on
hand to act as ushers and will be assisted
by two voting men from each playhouse
in the city. Six Adonises of the Police
Department will keep order. Promptly
at ion the orchestra will strike up the
liveliest thing it knows. It is the inten
tion after this to put on an entertainer
lor two. then to turn on blograph pictures
â¢of battle scenes, introduce Mayor Phelan,
who will make a few remarks, and then to
shoot Mr. Wendell Baston through a
stage trap into the gaze of the wondering
audience. Mr. Eastoir" has no whiskers
on the top of his head to deceive them,
A few hypnotic passes from the director
general of the auction ad the intending
buyers of 'poxes and choice seats are sup
posed to be dead easy. He will get out
his little hammer and start his assistants
on their way. Any one who has ever
seen Mr. Easton officiate at a function
of this sort knows the fund of humor at
his command. He is irresistible, and
when he gives any one a "knock down"
to another, the case is fixed. They say
he once arranged one between an impov
erished nobleman and a Lssiety girl, and
now they've got as far as the divorce
court.
This fund of humor is at the disposal
of the theatrical managers' committee to
day and if the running comments of Mr.-
Easton do not furnish enough action to
the piece a great many people are mis
taken.
Colonel I- J. Lyons, a Grand Army vet
eran, will do the "going, going, gone"
part of the performance and-two heroes
of Santiago. Major H. W. Cardwell and
Captain T. XV. Moore, who arrived lately
in the city, will lend their presence to the
scene.
The stage managers at their meeting
yesterday morning announced that they
had every reason to believe the boxes and
choice of seats would go as readily as th.-
California Volunteers responded to the
.call to arms. Many people had already
communicated their Intention of getting
iii early for choice pickings.
Remember, it costs you nothing to go
APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC.
The unexpected news re
ceived yesterday respecting
the arrival of the California
troops within thirteen days
from now has placed all the
committees in a very awk
ward position. The executive
council of the finance commit
tee earnestly appeals to the
public to mak* their sub
scriptions immediately. Those
who intend to give are re
quested to do so promptly,
without waiting to be asked.
They should send their sub
scriptions by mail.
It is impossible for the
committee to proceed with, the
decorations and their prelim
inary arrangements without
some definite knowledge of the
amount they will be able to
expend. The time is short,
but there are thousands, who
are desirous that a proper re
ception should be accorded to
the home-coming soldiers, who
will heed this appeal.

HOW THE SHERMAN
WILL MAKE THE RUN
a _ _=7=-_HE United States transport Sherman sailed from Yokohama for San
* Francisco at noon yesterday. Colonel Duboee, in a telegram announcing
*- the departure of the troopship, says that she' will be off the Faral
* X lones at noon. of August 22 or 23. Shipmasters are of the opinion that
*- the colonel has made a mistake in his calculations, as none of them
+ can see how the Sherman can get here before August 24 at the earliest
* Captain Barneson, superintendent of the transport service, said a few days
* ago: "The Sherman is now in better trim and her machinery in better order
* -than at any time since she came on the coast. I expect her to average -.9,
* knots each twenty-four hours, and if she makes 300 knots a day she will do
*" well. If all goes well she should make the run from Yokohama to ban i- ran
*" Cisco in fifteen days."
* If the Sherman comes across from Japan on a Mercator course, as many
* of the transports have done of late, she will have to cover 4,91 knots but if
*â¢ she comes on a great circle the distance will only be 4536 knots. At this time
* of the year, however, fogs are very prevalent on the great circle route and
* the chances are that Captain Grant will steer a medium course of say 4650
J miles to San Francisco. . __Â«-â '__Â«_'__
+ The average run for the transports from Nagasaki, which is 660 knots
J from Yokohama, is nineteen days. The Newport and Ohio on their last trips
__ made it in that time, while the Sherman made it in eighteen days. The best
1 run of the year was the fifteen days of the Hancock, .while the Puebla made
I it in 15 days 23 hours, and the Australia in 16 days. From Yokohama the rec-
Z. ord of 12 days 45 minutes is held by the China, made on the occasion when .
*. Lieutenant Schwerln was speeding the fiver. Repeatedly the China; Coptic
* and Doric have made the run in 12 days 13 hours, but Hun they are fifteen
*- knot steamers, while the Sherman is classed as "a good twelve-knot boat."
*- From this it will' be seen that Colonel Duboee has made a mistake In his
* calculations somewhere and that it will be the afternoon of August 24 or the
*â¢ morning of the 25th before the Sherman will be due.

TWO YOUTHFUL STARS WILL SHINE AT THE BIG BENEFIT.
ONE of the most attractive features at the benefit for the returning California Volunteers will, be the little
sketch, "A Doctor's Patient." by Harry Linton and Leila Mclntyre, two youngsters now appearing at the Or
phi .in. The sketch is simply the vehicle used by the young artists to convey their clever specialties. Leila
Mclntyre made her .first appearance on the stag.- in 1886. From then until six years _ ago she took part in numer
ous amateur productions. By I '-.: her work had attracted considerable attention and she accepted an engage
ment with Waite's Comic Opera Company. She afterward played soubrette parts with the Burton Stanley Comedians,
and three years ago went into vaudeville. She has been successful, and in spite of her tender years is able to com
mand a big salary. Although but a youngster, she is her own business manager and possesses a very keen apprecia
tion of the value of her services. Oft the stage she is just a pretty little girl, frank and full of life. Harry Linton has also
been successful beyond his years. He was last here with the Gay Coney Island Company, In which he played leading
comedy parts.
and shoe men a special committee con- |
sisting of W. P. Buckingham, Fred Me-
Williams and George H. Young was ap
pointed to wait on them for subscriptions.
it was reported to the council that
Henry Jacobs, having heard on the street
that he had been appointed on the green
fruit committee, started out at once, and
In a short time had collected $14."). He
subsequently learned that he was one of
the canners and packers committee. His
efforts are none the less appreciated and
the money will be added to the fund.
George Newhall has expressed his in
tention to subscribe $1"". M. Kohlberg has
turned in his book with $100 collected.
while C. S. Benedict gathered $200 in a
few hours' Work.
The following letter will be sent' to the
banks, pas. water, express companies and
all other corporations, with a view to
hastening their subscriptions:
"Gentlemen: The executive council of
the finance committee for the welcoming
of our soldiers desire to call your atten
tion to the fact that n. committee will
call upon you on Saturday. August 12,
to ascertain the amount of your donations j
to this public fund, the committee assum
i::_. that you intend to give. We respect- !
fully suggest that your donation be as
liberal as your public obligations will
permit.
"The object of calling your attention to
this is so that you can see your directors
before the committee calls on you. Re
spectfully yours.

NATIVE SONS AND
DAUGHTERS MEET |
Details of the Big Parade Ar
rang.-d by Committees.
The Native Sons' and Daughters' execu
tive committee met last night at head
quarters and heard the report of the
badge committee, which was that a red,
while and blue badge had been selected,
also a gold one with button. _;'â¢'.:â '
The invitation committee was em
powered to Issue invitations to those who
will go on the committee's tug in the
naval parade. It was decided to discon
tinue the soliciting of donations for the
Native Daughters' banquet.
The parade committee then held a meet
ing with L. C. Pistoles! in the chair. .Mr.
Lewis suggested the appointment of a j
sub-committee of three to confer with a
like committee of the executive commit- !
tee. A. L. gens tern, M. Colin and j
Mrs. < '. I-'. Kapp were appointed such j
committee.
The president stated that estimates of
the cost of the parade are about 14000. -
The secretary announced that the mem
bers of the Fifth Regiment would not be
able to remain over night, but that they
would 'take part in the military reception.
Syl. Shaben, marshal of the Foresters
of America, stated that the order would
do all it could to make the biggest show
In the parade.
Mr. Morgenstern said that he wished to
give the assurance of the Native Sons i
and Daughters that whatever money the ]
citizens' committee should contribute to i
the parade committee should be properly \
and judiciously expended. To tnat end
were appointed S. It. Daniels and Colonel
W. P. Sullivan Jr. of the- citizens' parade
sub-committee and J. W. i_ewis, J. ____,
Carroll and I_. ('. Pistol, si of the Native
Sons as a finance and auditing committee,
all bills to be approved by it.

gold rosette; for chief of staff, pure
white; for chief aid. blue; for marshals of
division, old gold; aids to grand marshal,
red, and aids to division marshals, blue;
gauntlets gray.
Colonel Sullivan asked what number of !
bands and carriages would be required.
The information In exact figures could
not be furnished, but it was stated that
there would be carriages required for the
veterans of the Mexican war, for the Na- j
tive Daughters and Pioneers.
Colonel Sullivan said he thought the j
Pioneers ought to meet their own ex
pense for carriages. He thought that the I
Governor and staff ought to ride on
horseback and not in carriages, and that
the Mayor and city officials should pa
rade on foot. J
THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 10, 1899.
Mrs. Mattie Ferris suggested that the
Native Daughters should walk and that
she would urge that idea In the parlors.
The meeting adjourned to the call of
the chair.
The Society of California Pioneers dur
ing the da;,- -sent word to the grand mar
shal that owing to advanced age and in
firmities if was impossible for the mem
bers to parade. The society offered' the.
use of its assembly hall for committee
meetings The grand marshal sent a let
ter to the society stating that the Native
Sons and Daughters would consider it un
fortunate if the fathers of the present
generations did not take part and he in
formed them that all members who- would
participate would be furnished with car
riages. He expressed the hope that they
would accept the offer.
The Germania Club will parade with its
own band and float.
The cigar makers ' reported that they
would turn out with the labor organiza
tions.

GENERAL PLAN FOR

-* __ day after the arrival in the bay of the transport Sherman with the Call- -*
+ fornia boys from the Philippines. .:â¢"â " "â¦*â¢
+_ â¢ The programme, as at present outlined, contemplates a naval parade on the â Â¥â 
-* afternoon of the arrival, with a grand illumination' at night of the shipping -*
â Â¥ in the harbor. Next morning the Fighting. First is to disembarks, and, after â¢Â¥â 
â * breakfast with their relatives at the ferry depot, march with military *
"* escort .to the Presidio, where they will be given leave to spend the remainder J
"* of the day as they list, which will undoubtedly be at the homes they left to J
+ fight for their country. That night the electric light display Will probably J
* be made in their honor. The next night comes the big parade, when all the *
"â * organizations, civic and military, in San Francisco, re-enforced by many *
"â ** from surrounding towns, will march with the California heroes under the J
* canopy, of incandescent light provided by the citizens' committee, to be ac- ' *

No feature of the reception to the home

grander or more picturesque than the
naval parade on the bay provided for yes

Francisco.
Seldom has more enthusiasm been man
i ifested than that at the meeting held dur

The attendance was not as large as was
expected on account of the funeral of

"The genera] committee." said Commis

Commission to take charge of the arrival
In the harbor of the California volunteers
and we desire that it be made an over
whelming success. For that purpose we
have invited you shipping men to meet

that devolves upon us is the selection of
an admiral to take Immediate charge of
the naval display and I would ask for
your nominations for that important posi
tion." ___Â£___
. A. XV. Foster nominated John D. Spreck
eis and the nomination was made unani
mous.
Mr. Spreckeis was called upon for a
speech, and in response said; "If you ex
pect a speech from me you will be dis
appointed; but I am sure you will not be
disappointed in the naval parade. With
the assistance of the shipping men I will
endeavor to arrange such a demonstration
as will reflect as much credit on this com
munity as was reflected on the State by
our gallant boys in Manila."
â¢ Chairman Kilburn said the naval pa
rade committee was of the opinion that
the reception fund could be swelled if
owners of vessels would volunteer to car
ry excursionists at a small fee on the day
of the demonstration, the moneys so re
alized to si>e turned over to the citizens'
finance committee. . He said he was ready
to receive proffers of aid in this direction.
A. W. Foster then placed the large
steamer Ukiah at the disposal of the com
mittee. One thousand people can be ac
commodated on the boat.
Chairman Kilburn informed the meeting
that Goodall, Perkins & Co. and the South
ern Pacific Company had also volunteered
several boats.
Alfred E. Pryor donated the. use of the
Sunol and another steamer. . Charles
Clarke said his company would provide
one or more steamers to take care of 1000
people. J. R. llanify announced that ne
would fit up on the day named all the
steam schooners which may happen to be
in the harbor belonging to his company,
and Commodore Gutte will donate the
yacht Chispa.
The details of the parade were all left to

â¢At this stage of the proceedings enthu
siasm fairly bubbled over; so that when
Mr. Prvor suggested a night demonstra
tion on "the bay it was seized with avidity.
Everybody was In favor of it and sug
gestions began to pour in by the dozen
on the chair. If half of them are carried
Into effect "a night in Venice" will be only
a tallow dip in comparison to the illu
mination it- San Francisco harbor. II was
suggested that scow schooners towed by
tugboats be decorated with lighted Japa
nese lanterns and all other vessels be in
vited to illuminate in the same manner.
Commissioner Herold suggested that a
raft with several barrels of pitch be set
on fire and this, with colored lights, would
add to the beauty of the scene. This, he
said would. give the boys a better Idea
of the warmth of their reception than
anything else. The night parade will be
an* auxiliary to the main event and the
tugs Markham. Irwin and Caroline will be
pressed Into service. Â»
Admiral Spreckeis, in outlining his plans
for the naval parade, said that the trans
port Sherman would be met by two col

CONTRACTS AWARDED
FOR ILLUMINATION
Ten Thousand Lamps Will Light
Up the Line of March.
The citizens' decoration committee de
cided at yesterday's meeting to award
contracts to the- Pacific Incandescent
Lamp Company for the erection of 10,000
lamp*- for the Illumination of the city
on th.- occasion of the reception to the
California Volunteers.
The meeting was hold In the office of
the Union Trust Company, "W. J. Martin
(chairman), A. Schilling. I. W. Hellman
Jr W H. Mills ami Charles Hlrsch were
present, as was M. H. de Young of the
executive committee. The announcement
that a cablegram had been received from
Colonel Duboee made the committee re
alize that it must act quickly to put the
lamps in place. 'The bid and specifica
tions of the Pacific Incandescent Lamp
Company being by far the Lowest re
ceived and the one nearest conformity
with the committee's Ideas was read by
It provided for the illumination of the
City Hall dome with 3000 Incandescent
lamps of 16-candle power for $2000, a less
amount flown to 2000 to be put .in place
at the rate of 70 cents a lamp; 2000 lamps
for the Illumination of the ferry depot
tow,** for $1400. and 5000 lamps strung
across Market street from the ferry to
Larkin street, fifty feet apart, twenty
four lamps to a string. $2000.
It was finally decided by the committee
that desired to have every fifth string
raised above the others and festooned,
and it was informed this would cost $.00
additional. It was also found that the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Company
desired the committee to borrow 27.000
feet of copper wire for a main and would
charge it $fioo for labor for its erection.
Representatives of the Pacific Incandes
cent Lamp Company offered to substitute
their own plans, to answer all the pur
poses for not more than $200.
These figures seemed to meet the appro
bation of the committee and it was
moved that the entire contract be award
ed to that .company as follows:
3000 lamps. City Hall dome. $2000; 2000
am ferry building. $1400: 5000 lamps,
from the ferry up Market to City Hall
avenue to the City Hall, with festoons
as stated and ail necessary mains, $2100.
Total $5800.
This will leave the committee to pro
vide for the payment of the current, and
a committee was appointed to wait on the
various companies to induce them to fur
nish this current gratis."
GREAT PARADE WILL
BE HELD AT NIGHT
Native Sons and Daughters
Agree to the Plan.
The great parade arranged by. the Na
tive Sons and Daughters will take place
at night instead of in the afternoon, as
at first contemplated. This was decided
yesterday at the joint conference at
Mayor Phelan's private office between
representatives of the Native Sons and
Daughters and of the citizens' reception
committee.
In the absence of Mayor Phelan. M. H.
de Young acted as chairman. He called
upon L. F. Byington to address the con
ference for the Native Sons' and Daugh
ters' committee.
"Our committee originally decided: to
parade in the day time," Mr. Byington
said, "but after due ] consideration we
think that it should take place at night.
We will co-operate with the citizens'
committee to make the affair a success,
but would ask that the parade be held
on the night of the day after the troops
land." , , __,
A general discussion took place, partic
ipated in by Grand Marshal Pistoles!,
George Drvden, Mrs. Mary Tilimann,
John Lewis, A. Morgenstern and Harry
Fisher. Mrs. Tilimann stated that it was
the desire of the parents to have their
boys at home on the night of the day they
landed, and Mr. Dryden argued that peo
ple from the Interior should be given the
necessary time to reach this city.
"In view of the concession of the Na
tive Sons' and Daughters' commit In
changing their parade from a day to' a
night one," said W. J. Martin of the citi
zens' cdmmlttee, "I move that their re
quest to hold it on the day after the
troops land be granted." This was car- ,
ried unanimously.
On motion of Mr. Martin, the -.-bnimit
tee will request the Governor to declare
that day a legal holiday.
Colonel Sullivan then read the following
cablegram from Colonel Duboee; '_

presentation of medals take place after
the night parade; but it is the sense of
the Native Sons' and Daughters' commit
tee that the next night be devoted to that
purpose. . _________________________-_-_-_-_-_-_-_.

made no provisions for medicines, feed
for horses or other incidental expenses.
