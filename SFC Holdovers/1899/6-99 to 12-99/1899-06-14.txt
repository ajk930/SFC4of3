MANILA, June 14.â The Ameri
can loss yesterday was nine killed
and thirty wounded. The Filipino
loss was heavy, forty being found
dead in the first trench. The insur
gents, who numbered between 1000
and 1500, were driven back to their
Zapote River stronghold, where they
are supposed to have 5000 men un
der arms, with four field pieces.

MANILA, June 13. â General Lawton
unexpectedly stirred up one of the live.
liest engagements of the war south of
Las Plnas this morning, upon which oc
casion American field guns were en
gaged in the first artillery duel against
a Filipino battery concealed In the
jungle. Companies F and I of . the
y Twenty-first Infantry were nearly sur
rounded by a large body of insurgents,
but the Americans cut their way out
with heavy losses.
The United States turret ship Monad
nock and the gunboats Helena and
Zaflro trained their batteries on Fa
koor and the rebel trenches near Las
Pinas all morning. Bakoor was once
on Ore, but the natives stopped the
spread of the flames.
During the night an insurgent can- i
non was fired three times at the Amer- j
icans on the outskirts of Las Pinas. |
General Lawton this morning took a
battalion of the Fourteenth Regiment j
and two companies of the Twenty-first
Regiment to locate the rebel battery,
and then two guns of the Sixth Artil
lery and four mountain guns were
planted against it at 600 yards dis
tance. The rebels had a large gun, {
from which they were firing home- i
made canister and bombs loaded with '
â¢ nails, and two smaller guns. Their I
shooting 'was most accurate. The first
lot of canister burst directly in front
of Scott's guns and another shattered

GENERAL LUNA
IS MURDERED
BY AGUINALDO
Put Out of thje Dictator's
Way Because r|e Is
Too Ambitious.
Ppf-.ai Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
i%/w ANILA. June 13 âGeneral
/ â¼ V Antonio Luna, one of the bit
terest foes of the Americans in the
Philippines, has been assassinated by
ordei 1 of Aguinaldo.
Luna has recently found himself in
opposition to the chiefs views, and
has not only disobeyed orders, but at
one time stopped Aguinaldo's Peace
Commissioners while on the way to
treat with the Americans.
Aguinaldo ordered his death, and
these orders were carried out by the
Dictator's fanatical followers.
The report of the assassination
caused great excitement among the
Filipinos in Manila, which was added
to later when the report was con
firmed. The assassination of Luna
occurred on June 8, at Kabanatuan,
to which place he had gone to confer
with Aguinaldo. He had just been
promoted to the rank of major gen
eral by the Filipino leader. By a pre
concerted plan, he was kept waiting
at the door of Aguinaldo's headquar
ters until his patience became ex
hausted. After demanding admission
several times he attempted to force
his way in. He drew a revolver, but
before he could use it was seized by
Aguinaldo's guards, and one of them,
named Ney, stabbed him several
limes.
General Luna's aid. Colonel Ramon,
who was near him. rushed to the gen
eral's rescue, but was seized and dis
armed and cut to pi-ces with bolos.
Luna and Ramon both died a few
: minutes after being stabbed.
It is said Luna had become so im
portunate in his demands on Aguin
aldo for power and increased author
! ity that the Filipino leader decided
Luna's death was necessary for his
personal safety and the Filipino
cause. The major general's commis
sion was merely -a bait to throw Luna
off nis guard and render the assassi
nation comparatively easy.
There is open rejoicing among the
Filipinos here that Luna is no longer
capable of making trouble. They
realize that he was a menace to peace
and the complete pacification of the
islands couM hardly have been ac
complished while he was alive and at
liberty. He was noted throughout his
career for producing discord and mis
chief wherever he was. On May 4

nearly exhausted the companies of the
Twenty-first retreated, hut General
Lawton dashed down and rallied the
men. A little group made a desperate
stand. General Lawton, Major Starr
and Lieutenants Donovan and Con
nelly, taking rifles from the wounded
men, fired at the enemy, bringing down
some of the rebel sharpshooters from
trees. Finally their cartridges were all
gone, and they were forced to break
through the enemy's flank, carrying the
wounded to the main body of the
troops.
Lieutenant Donovan, whose leg was
broken, floundered for a mile through
a bog after leading his men in the face
of a greatly superior force.
General Lawton ceased fighting until
reinforcements could be brought. Two
battalions of the Fourteenth Regiment
and one battalion of the Ninth Regi
ment were hurried to the front, and in
the afternoon the battle was resumed.
The Monadnock anchored close to the
shore, and her heavy guns pounded the
rebels continuously. while the
smaller warships, steaming along the
shore, poured bullets from their rapid
nre guns at the enemy. The Filipino
forec engaged appears to have been the
largest and best organized body of men
which has met our troops.
The Americans were compelled to ad
vance along narrow roads and over
small bridges commanded by earth
works ten feet thick.
The only means of crossing th^Zapote
was by a small bridge, which the Fili
pinos commanded with trenohc-s
spreading V shaped, whence they could
concentrate their fire on the bridge.
They also had the advantage of the
trees and junglep, so the Americans
could hardly see ahead.
When the battle was renewed with
the reinforcements our battery had si
lenced the enemy's guns, and the Amer
icans, wading waist deep in the mud of
the salt flats, poured a steady volley
of musketry at the rebels, driving their
opponents beyond the river.

THE TOWN
OF HERMAN
DESTROYED
One Hundred Persons Dead
in Track of a Nebraska
Tornado.
RUIN INJTS PATH
Not One House Left Standing in
Which to Care for the
Wounded.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The tornado season in the East
is fairly open. On Monday night
a black funnel-shaped cloud de
scended upon the little town of
New Richmond, in Wisconsin, '
fairly blotting the place out of
existence and leaving death and
destitution in its path.
Last night the little town of
Herman, in Nebraska, was de
stroyed, and ove r 100 fi/cs are
said to have been lost
OMAHA, Nebr., June 13.- A tor
nado struck the town Â« f Herman,
in Washington County, this even-
Ing and wiped the place out of
existence. Herman is a place of
about 300 inhabitant- in the extreme
northern part of Washington County.
It is on the line of the Chicago, St.
raul. Minneapolis and Omaha Railroad.
A conductor on the evening train from
Sioux City passed through the placÂ» no!
long after the storm, and he says that
not a building is left standing. He
himself counted twelve dead bodies ly
ing In the streets. The fatalities will
undoubtedly run up to a hundred, if
not higher. A special train has lÂ»ft
Blair, the county seat, for the scene of j
the disaster, carrying surgeons and ail
i ceded supplies.
Advices received by the Bee up to 11 j
o'clock to-night state that every build- j
Ing in the town is destroyed, except the
public school and one small dwelling,
both of which are on the outskirts. The
force of the wind was "terrific "and '
scarce one piece of any of the many
structures destroyed was left intact. ,
The scene in the streets of the once
thriving and beautiful little town is one
of destruction. Wrecked buildinsrs and
broken furniture, scarcely recognizable l
in its dilapidated condition, are strewn
all around, while dead bodies lie in
many places, the corpses badly disfig
ured and some of them hardly recogniz
able. The moans of th? injured mingle
with the calls of the rescuers as they
pursue their humanitarian work in the
dark by the flickering gleams of lan
terns. The relief train from Blair ar
rived about an hour after the storm and
the work of picking up the wounded
was begun.
Willing hands did what they could to
help the injured, and In the course of ;
an hour the train pulled out for Blair
with ninety-five injured on board. They .
were taken to Blair, as there is abso
tutely no place left at Herman at which
treatment could be administered.
All the citizens of Blair have thrown
open their houses to the wounded, and
the unfortunates are being cared for by
competent Burgeons. Many of the In
jured will die, but pome of them re
celved but slight injuries.
It is impossible at this hour, owing
to the confusion, to ascertain the num
ber of the dead, but twelve are known
to have been killed, and the list will
run very much higher. Among the
badly hurt is George B. Clyde, the lo- ;
col station agent for the Omaha road j
at Herman.
Superintendent Jaynes of the Omaha
road was at Tekamah when he;
heard of the disaster, and left at once
for Herman on a handcar, taking two
physicians along with him to assist in
succoring the wounded.
The dead at Herman so far as ob
tainable at this hour are:
KILLED.

A new standpipe weighing twenty
tons was carried a block and a^half and j
a large safe was carried two blocks, j
The main street of the town is a mass !

midnight with medical aid and other j
relief for the sufferers.

Persons Killed.
NEW RICHMOND, Wis., June 13.â
The tornado that swept out of ex
istence the prosperous little city of New
Richmond is the most disastrous in
point of fatality ever occurring in this
section. The exact number of dead is
still unknown, but it will certainly
reach 100 and very probably will con

were recovered to-day the bodies were

THE CUBANS
GET READY
FOR REVOLT
Leaders Conceal Arms in
Preparation for Rebellion
Against United States.
Special Cable to The Call and the Now York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA. June 13. â Officers in
charge of the Cuban forces at Guana
bacoa have collected all the arms from
the soldiers and gone into the country
with them. Mayor Hyatt has reported
this condition of things to General Lud
low. There were about 300 soldiers in
that city, and they were the best armed
forces in the neighborhood of Havana,
having many Mausers, good carbines
and Springfield rifles. These soldiers
were awaiting the return of Lieutenant
Colonel Randall from the country to
receive their money at Havana on
Thursday.
The fact that the officers had collect
ed these arms was not known to Mayor
Hyatt until Sunday. He was given au
thority to receive the arms, but only
nine weapons had been given up. On
investigation he learned that the offi
cers had represented themselves as
agents for the Government, and on se
curing the arms Immediately left the
city.
It is now suspected that a similar
condition of affairs exists in many
places on the island, and that rifles are
being put in hiding, awaiting an up
rising, or have been already distributed
among bandits, who, according to all
reports, are well armed.
The apparent indifference of the Gov
ernment to the capture of bandits and
to the protection of Spaniards in the
country has brought forth strong pro
tests from Spaniards in Havana, they
ascribing the seeming apathy of Gen
eral Brooke to the fact that he depends
wholly on reprts of the Cuban secre
taries, mayors and civil governor!? for
information, and saying that facts are
misrepresented. Bandits thus far have
killed only Spaniards on their raids,
and Spaniards assert that an attempt
is being made in the unprotected prov
inces to exterminate the race.
brought to the schoolhouse or to the
Catholic or to the Congregational
church. Thence they are to be taken to
the cemetery, except in a few cases
where homes still stand, in which the
remains can be kept for a few hours,
during which the final tribute of love
can be tendered by the bereaved fam
ili^s. The bodies were prepared for
burial by local and visiting undertak
ers and as soon as identified were
marked and disposed of as friends re
quested.
The Catholic priest, who had spent a
sleepless night and day in looking: after
the bodies and souls of his parishioners,
was one of the coolest and best workers
i among: the many who volunteered their
aid. Xurses and physicians from St.
Paul, who had come down by special
! train on the Omaha road as soon as
| the news of the disaster reached the
Minnesota capital, were of great help,
all night and day, and ivhen the day
closed all the seriously injured were be-
I lieved to have been cared for. Those
whose injuries wpre serious, but whose
chances for recovery were believed to
be good, were quickly spnt to the hos
pitals of St. Paul and Mineapolis,
where better care can be given them.
j The slightly injured and those whose
cases seem hopeless were kept here and
were given the hest attention possible.
The list of dead gradually increased
during the day and to-night it seemed
| that one hundred might be the mini
â  mum estimate of the dead, while the
j list of the injured will reach and prob
ably exceed two hundred.
During the afternoon the body of
Patrick Kaling, the 14-year-old son of
i Nat Kaling, was brought to the Cath
| ollc church. The body was horribly
| mangled. A little daughter of a Mr.
â  Williams was brought to the same place
from the ruins of her father's home
near the railroad tracks. Walter Far
rell, a boy, was also laid among the
\ dead in that church. Pat McNally,
I who was in the list of injured, died dur
j ing the day. At a late hour this after
noon the rescuers gathered together
most of the pieces of the mangled body
: of Michael Heffron, and his name was
added to the list of the dead. '
During the day scattered groups of
rescuers searched the debris where
I bodies might be found. A fire company
â  from St. Paul kept two streams of
â  water playing on the smoldering ruins,
j for fire had been added to the horrors
j of the tornado and a dozen fires were
; blazing till a heavy rain at the close of
I the day about extinguished the flames.
i Some of the merchants organized pri
j vate salvage corps and managed to
I save some property, but the amount
j was small.
The business portion of the city cov
ered a space of four squares each way,
I and was solidly built of brick and stone.
This entire space was swept clear,

Trees that lined the streets of the

broken clear off or twisted and up

THE HAGUE, June 13.â
Some signs of trouble are
appearing in consequence
of the arrival at The Hague of
Achmet Riza, the agitator of the
Young Turkish party, who has
come for the purpose of agitating
among the delegates to the con
ference in favor of Armenia
against the Sultan. He means to
give lectures and publish pam
phlets.
The Turkish delegates request
that he be expelled from the
Netherlands, as he was formerly
expelled from Belgium, but the
Dutch Liberal party oppose this
proposal as contrary to liberal
traditions.
The Turkish delegates threat
en to withdraw from the confer
ence and return to Turkey if the
enemy of their sovereign is al
lowed to agitate against him at
the seat of the European con
ference.
I have been able to peruse p. copy of
thf> American arbitration proposal,
which probaby has been merged into
the Russian proposal, telegraphed yes
terady. It exacts that to constitute a
permanent arbitration court, it must b*
agreed to by at least nine i.o^-ors, of
which eight must be European or
American.
It suggests that the court be com
posed of persons of high respectabilit/
and with a knowledge of international
law; that they should be nominated by
the highest court of justice existing in
each state, and that each of the nine
states would be represented in the ar
bitration court by one of the judges of
such court of justicee.
The court would first assemble to or
ganize not later than six months after
the arbitration plan has been agreed to,
and would itself choose its place of
meeting, which might vary from time
to time in the interest of justice or ac
cording to the convenience of the two
countries appealing to settle a quarrel.
It would be entitled to take cogni
zance of quarrels breaking out even
among countries not represented at the
conference.
All arguments will have to be brought
before the court in writing or in print.
All parties applying to the court for
arbitration will have to pledge them
selves to be bound by its decisionâ a
very drastic clause this, which will
meet with some opposition.
The full number of judges may sit
together or appoint thr^o of themselves
only to judge, provided that none of the
three belongs to one of the disputing
nations.
The general expenses of the court are
to be borne by the signatory powers,
but the expenses for arbirating will be
adjudicated by the court itself at the
time it pronounces judgment. These
tb.p signatory powers will have to pay
themselves. Any disputant country will
be entitled, after the court's award, to
a second hearing before the same
judges within three months after th*>
first sentence has been notified, if it be
able to bring forward any fresh testi
mony or fresh judicial arguments,
which appears to amount to initiating
a kind of arbitration court of appeal
within the original court.
Professor Martens, the celebrated
Russian jurist and a delegate to the
Conference, left The Hague to-day for
Paris to assist in arbitrating the Ven
ezuelan frontier question between Eng
land and the United States. He hopes
to settle the matter in two or thre*;
days. On his return to Holland the ar
bitration matter will be actively re
sumed.
THE GENEVA CONVENTION

This Is Begarded as the First Real
Triumph of the Peace
Conference.
THE HAGUE, June 13.â 1n view of
the statement published in the United
States that Frederick Holls of the
American delegation to the Peace Con
ference had cabled to the State Depart
ment at Washington that Germany was
opposed to arbitration in principle, the
correspondent of the Associated Press
called to-day upon Mr. Holls, who de
clared that there was absolutely no
foundation for such a statement. He
said that as a matter of fact he had not
sent the State Department a message
of any kind since his arrival here and
the cable messages forwarded by the
delegation had not contained the least
justification for the statement pub
lished.
â¢There is no doubt." said Mr. Holls,
"that the Germans, in this respect re

European nations, are not as enthusias2

RANCHER JONES
GIVEN NO CHANCE
BY HIS SLAYER
Wife of the Murderer Gloats
Over the Body of the
Dying Man,
PAX MIGUEL, June 13.â The testi
mony presented at the preliminary ex
amination of James O. Gillette at
Parkfleld this morning for the killing
of John H. Jones on Sunday evening
indicates that the crime was deliberate
and cold blooded. On Sunday afternoon
;.t about 6 o'clock France, the 12-year
old daughter of Jones, went to the pas
ture used jointly by Jones and Gillette
to drive her father's horses to water.
She being absent longer than usual,
her father mounted a horse and rode
t" the pasture to learn the cause. Airs.
Jones was in the yard in front of their
home at the time.
Jones assisted his daughter to sepa
rate th.' stock, and, after driving: his
I own into the road, was closing the Rate
I when Gillette, accompanied by his wife,
! was seen coming from the southâ the
I direction of his home. When within
thirty yards of Jones he stopped, took
deliberate aim and fired. Jones fell,
! i^ortally wounded. Mrs. Gillette ran
I up to the prostrate man, and, seeing
I he was dying, clapped her hands, cx
i claiming:
"Good job, Jiinmie!"
Mrs. Jones, observing Gillette and his
i wife approaching and her husband ap
| parently unaware of danger, had has
; tened to the scene, arriving just as
! Jones fell. Jones vecognized his wife
â  had romp in from all the BUr
roundlng country. After the .'inns the
c had crowded Into the city to do
their shopping before going home in
the evening. It was at this time that
Btorm cloud came up from the
s uthwest. The circua grounds were
outside the path of the storm, but the
people, being in the business places, fell
;\ prey to the terrific wind.
As soon as the news of the disaster
had reached the outside world offers
of help and help Itself began t me
Into the city. St. Paul, being the tail
road center to which New Richmond
w.is tributary, was first to learn of the
storm ainl its attendant woes and with
â¢ i or three hours sent the first re
lief train with physicians, nurses, hos
pital supplies and commissary stores
for the people of the stricken city. A
second and third train soon followed
and speedily neighboring cities in Wis
n sent in all they could gather for
their needy sister city. The Omaha
. the Wisconsin Central roads
ptly carried through all the bup
plies and delivered them to relief head
quarters whence they were delivered to
the people of the city. Superintendent
Thorn of the Wisconsin Central was
among the first to arrive and has given
his whole time to-dny to doing what he
could to Btraighten out, matters. Gen
eral Superintendent Scotl of the Omaha
arrived â¢ n the first relief train to-day
from st. Paul.
The Wisconsin Central suffered less
and bj early afternoon was able to
furnish wir.-s for the K reat mass of tel
egraphic business that lias accumulat
, d th>* Western Union office up-town
having b.-en in the part of the city
which was destroyed.
Congressman J. J. Jenkins of this
district arrived early on the scene and
promptly advised Governor Bcofleld of
the situation and the need of relief.
Hundreds of curious people from neigh
boring cities thronged the ruins to-day.
The desolate view of the New Rich
mond of to-day is one not Boon to be
forgotten. AmÂ»ns the broken frag
ments of their homos the people wan
der helplessly, striving aimlessly and
hopelessly to gather together what had
been left to them. On the east and
west limits of the city many houses
are still standing with little or no
damage and to those houses the oo
cupants welcomed their less fortunate
neighhors and friends, giving them
such aid as was possible.
The property loss cannot be esti
mated at this time and may never be
accurately known. Tt was almost to
tal, for the insurance agents report
that no tornado insurance was carried
In the town and only a small number
of places where fire contributed to the
destruction of the property will the
business men be at all reimbursed for
their losses.
CONTROL OF PRICES
OF FARM PRODUCTS
Industrial Commission Extends Its
Inquiry Into the North
west.
WASHINGTON, June 13.â The Indus
trial Commission has extended the duties
of its sub-commission, consisting of Sen
it t it Kyle and Commissioners a. L.
Harris of Ohio and Kugene D. Conger of
Michigan, so as u> authorize it to t.ik^
testimony upon the agricultural condi
tions in "the Northwest. The inquiry will
be largely as to the control of prices of
agricultural products by combinations of
railroads and elevator companii-s.
Another special sub-commission has been
authorized to consist of CommlssionerM.
1 1 Kntchford of Indiana, ex-Senator Lee
Mantle of Montana and Representative
John C. Bell of Colorado. Its inquiry will
be devoted to mining conditions in the
States west of the Mississippi River. Mr.
Ratchford was selected to preside and to
direct the inquiry. The probability is
that the sub-commission will begin Its
work in the early part of July.
The commision has selected Harvey M.
Friend of Washington to make a digest
of testimony and bills In Congress touch-
Ing fictitious dealings in agricultural
products.
Professor Ernest Mas of New York,
formerly chemical expert of the Glucose
Sugar Refining Company of Chicago, tes
tified before the commission to-day that
when he refused to sign a protest to Con
gress against the passage of the Mason
pure food bill the company stopped his
salary, although he had a five-year con
tract. Mr. Mas expressed the conviction
that the glucose trust was a branch of
the sugar trust, and said the price of glu
cose had doubled as soon as the trust
was formed.

"Winton Won't Come On," and says:
The famous \Vintnn-< 'harron match appears
to be in a decidedly bad way after things
I looked so favorable for arrangements. That
j is really the grist of a cablegram received yes
-1 terday by the Herald, which tells us that Win

sort of a bet, were It even a dollar. He
! claims that he has been misunderstood and
| that the 20,000 francs deposited by him was
only as a guarantee of his good faith and to
bring about â  |Â«1ouÂ« match having only in
; view the titling of the Interesting question
!of superiority in manufacture. He does not,
he says, wi.Â«h to turn this matter into a
' money Question, but if Oharron wants to make
| a big wager he will find In America people
ready to put up all he wishes. As a stake
only, Winton will not personally put a single
sou on the race.
If his declaration!" are such as they appear
to read and M they, have been . narrated, and
if they have been correctly reported, we shall
iv permuted to speak of Winton as â¢ Merry
Andrew,.: One can scarcely find in his method
of proceeding that practical sen.-c which we

i and uttered a few words before becom
ing unconscious.
Gillette after the shooting ran down
the road to the residence of G. Q. Rus
sell, and informed him of what had
happened. Then he left for his home
further on, and later went to Parkfield
and gave himself up.
Mrs. Jones, seeing that her 1 husband
was badly wounded, sent the daughter
; France, to town for assistance. Be-
I fore physicians arrived he was dead.
The autopsy made by !>r. McNaul of
this pla'-e showed that the bullet en
. tered between the seventh and eighth
ribs, followed the course of the rib
around to the lumbar joint of the verte
! brae, cut the spinal cord in two and
| was again deflected and ranged around
to the front, lodging under the skin on
the left side.
Jones was unarmed and had only a
small pocketknife on his person. He
had been using a rifle owned by Allie
! Gillette, a brother of the murderer, for
three months past, but last Saturday
Allie Gillette went to him and got it
back. This rifle was the one used by-
James Gillette in killing Jones.
Jones leaves a widow and five chil
dren, the eldest being France. They
are in almost destitute circumstances.
The funeral will take place at Park
field to-morrow morning.
Gillette will be taken to Palinas to
morrow to await trial, being without
bail.

VALUE OF ALCOHOL
AS HUMAN FOOD
Minm/ETOWN. Conn.. June 13.â At
the meeting of the Middletown Scientific
Association this evening Professor At
water of the Wesleyan University re
jw.rte<l the results of his experiments re
garding the effects of alcohol lately car
ried out upon a man in the respiration
calorimeter.
The special object of the experiments
! reported this evening was to study the
nutritive effect- of alcohol.. In some of
these experiments pure alcohol was ad
ministered with water or coffee. In oth
ers it was given in the form of whisky or
brandy.. Still others are planned in which
beer and wine will be used. The alcohol
is taken with an ordinary diet of meat,
bread, butter, sugar and the like. The
amount per day has been equal to about
two and a half ounces of absolute al
cohol.
Three important results were observed:
First, extremely little alcohol was given
off from the body unconsumed. Indeed, it
was oxidized, burned as completely as
bread, meat or any other food. Sec
ondly, in the oxidization all of the poten
tial energy of the alcohol was trans
formed into heat and external muscular
power. In other words, the body made
the same use of the energy of the alco
hol as that of sugar, starch and other
ordinary food materials. Third, the al
! cohol protected the body material from
I consumption, just as effectively as the
| corresponding amounts of sugar and
i starch; that is to say, whether the body
I was at rest or at work it held Its own
just as well with the one as with the
! other.
DISCOVERS A CURE
FOR MALARIAL FEVER
HALIFAX, N. S., June 13.â Joseph '
Chamberlain, Secretary for the Colonies
In the British Government, not long ago
said: "The man who should find a cure
for malaria and the fevers which have
desolated the African colonies, make the â 
tropics more livable for the white man
and reduce the risk from disease to some
thing of an ordinary average would do
more for the world and the British em
pire than the man who adds a new prov
ince to the wide dominions of the Queen "
This caught the eye of Dr. J. Gordon
Bennett of this city, and he wrote to Mr.
Chamberlain of a discovery which he be
lieves he has made. He is not over eager
to talk about the nature of the remedy
but in an interview said: "For twenty
years I have been investigating this rem
edy, but it is only within three years that
I have brought it to perfection. Two
weeks ago I wrote to Mr. Chamberlain
asking him to make a thorough test of
my remedy, and my son, G. Arlington
Bennett, has gone to London to be pres
ent at a series of tests. My remedy ia
solely applied by absorption through" the
porea of the skin ami thence into the
blood, and not through the stomach
where its introduction is baneful. My an
tidote. I shnll prove, will effect a cure in
forty-eight hours, and if applied when the
symptom? of malarial fever first appear,
less than twelve hours will destroy the
fever germs." 1

TWO STEAMERS
COLLIDE DURING
A HEAVY FOG
The Macedonia Struck and Dis=
abled by the Hamilton Off
Long Branch,
NEW YORK. June 13.â The Old Do
minion steamship Hamilton, which
sailed from New York to-day for Nor
folk and Newport News, ran into the
German steamship Macedonia off Long
Branch, and it is supposed that the
Macedonia subsequently sank. Three
passengers and nineteen of the crew of
the Macedonia were saved and brought
to this port. A dense fog prevailed
over thâ¬- lower bay and along the coast.
The Hamilton had on board a large
number of passengers. At 5:55 this
evening while proceeding at reduced
speed and sounding her whistle, the
Hamilton suddenly ran into a steamer,
which proved to be the Macedonia,
striking her on the starboard side and
cutting into her hull twelve feet. The
shock was terrific, and indescribable
confusion prevailed for a time. Order
was finally restored on the Hamilton
and the crew was sent to quarters. The
Macedonia's crew got rtut its boats as
the disabled vessel drifted away from
the Hamilton.
Those taken on board the Old Do
minion liner were three passengers â
| Captain Moses Walton, United Statos
I Volunteer quartermaster; Bernard T.
j Hansen and A. L. Ebbe'rtyâ and six
. teen of the German steamer's crew, in
â¢ â¢luding H. Maas. the mate, and H. Am]
] har.dt and H. Leon, chief engineer and
: second engineer, respectively. One boat
I was missing, which was lost in the fog.
LAWTON'S FIGHT
AT LAS PINAS
Continued from First Page.
across the deep stream, the enemy
driven practically out <>f sight, while
the men in blue and khaki lay in the
main bushes, many of them without
any shelter, under fire for three hours,
without a moment's cessation, pouring
bullets at the enemy as fast as they
could load. The thousands of rillcs
Mended into a continuous .roar, which
was vastly different from the intermit
tent skirmish rattle of most of
the engagements.
One battalion after another General
Lawton summoned from Las Pinas, un
til only enough troops of reserves were
left in tho town to prevent the Fili
pinos attacking the Americans in the
rear, which was feared, as they were
creeping around our left through the
woods, delivering a flanking fire, which
put a great strain upon the endurance
of the Americans who were flounder
ing in the mud across the river, while
on the right the Filipinos' sharpshoot
ers, hidden in the trees, were peppering
our men.
Thanks to the poor marksmanship of
the rebels our loss was not great. An
army, however, has seldom fought un
der a greater disadvantage or more
courageously than did our regulars, a
majority of whom were, comparatively
speaking, recruits, who could have been
pardoned for retiring, in the face of
such a fierce fire, from exposed posi
tions. The Fourteenth Regiment lay
to the right of the bridge and in front
was the Twelfth Regiment, with the
Ninth on the right and the Twenty
first up the road facing the bridge,
which was the key to the situation. On
the bridge were the bodies of two
Americans who had attempted to rush
across, and many wounded were car
ried from the open ground before the
bridge. i
After firing in volleys for a short
time the Americans were ordered to
fire when and where they could See the
enemy. It was every man for himself,
and the best the men could do was to
aim at the faint mists arising from the
rebels' smokeless powder. General
Lawton, though exhausted by the
morning's fight, rallied by sheer will
power and was the commanding figure
in the battle. He went along the lines
directing and encouraging the troops.
General Wheaton and General Oven
shine were equally courageous. In
fact the generals were among the few
men on the battlefield who refused to
take shelter under the hottest fire. The
only approach to the fighting ground
was by a narrow, winding road, where
the rebel bullets dropped thickly,
wounding several of our men. At 4
o'clock there was an hour's lull in thÂ«
fighting and an artillery sergeant gal
loped back to where two guns of the
mountain battery were waiting in re
serve and shouted: "Bring up those
guns!" The sergeant then tumbled ex
hausted from his horse.
Twenty wounded men were carried
to a native boat waiting on the beach,
which was rowed to Paranaque.
It is impossible at present to esti
mate the number of Filipino dead.
There are many bodies In the fields the
Americans traversed.
This battlefield, incidentally, was
formerly the scene of several of the
greatest struggles between the Span
iards and the Filipinos. The Zapote
River was considered impregnable and
hundreds of Spaniards and Filipinos
have been killed while fighting over the
game bridge in former contests for its
possession. In June, 1897, Generals Pio
del Pilar and Trias turned the scale
of war to the side of the Filipinos by
defeating the Spanish army there on
the eve of the decisive battle â carrying
the native militia with them and there
by breaking the chain of defense
around Manila.
At daylight to-day the rebels at Ca
vite Viejo dropped two shells from a
big, smooth-bore gun mounted in front
of the church Into the navy yard. The
only damage done was to splinter the
top of the huge shears on the mole.
The gunboats Callao, Manila and Mo
quito proceeded to dismount the guns.
After breakfast the rebels opened fire
along the beach to Bakoor. After
silencing the big gun at Cavite Viejo
the gunboats ran close along the shore,
bombarding the rebel position. The
rebels replied with rifle fire and with
the fire of some small pieces of artil
lery. So vigorous was the enemy's fire
that at 9:20 a. m. the gunboat Helena
joined the gunboats already named ana
the Princeton, Monterey and Monad
nock, from their anchorage, dropped
occasional big shells among the rebels.
ThiP apparently only served to Incite
the rebelÃ, as they kept up an incessant
fire of musketry and^ artillery near the
mouth of the Zapote River, two miles
north of Bakoor.
The fire of all seven warships was
concentrated on this point shortly after
noon, when the upper bay presented the
appearance of being the scene of a
great naval battle. The insurgents
were eventually forced to abandon their
guns after holding out for four hjurs,
only to be confronted by General Law
ton's force on land and in their rear,
whern there was heavy fighting.

MAY BE NECESSARY
TO CALL VOLUNTEERS
WASHINGTON, June 13.â Officials at
Washington have spent an anxious day
as the result of the determined resist
ance offered by the Filipinos to the ad
vance of General Lawton's troops. The
only bit of encouragement presented by
the situation arises out of the fact of
the murder of General Luna, showing
dissensions among the Filipinos. And
thiF may prove in the nature of a boom
erang to the United States, if the state
ments accredited by some of the offi
cials to President Sehurman that Luna
was one of the prominent insurgent
leaders in favor of peace are correct.
So far ag the fighting between the
Americans and Filipino troops south of
Manila is concerned, no fears are enter
tained for the safety of General Law
ton's command, as the men are well
supported by men-of-war lying just off
shore and, if assaulted by too large a
force of the enemy, can retire under
their guns for protection.
The Filipino situation was the impor
tant topic of discussion at the <"abinet
meeting to-day, when General Otis" dis
patch was presented by the President.
There is no longer any doubt in the
minds of officials that the military sup
pression of the Filipinos is the only
means to pursue to bring about peace
and order in the islands, and no ex
pectation is entertained that peace ne
gotiations will be entered upon by the
American Commissioners until definite
propositions are submitted by Agui
naldo or until the insurgent forces are
thoroughly whipped.
It is apparent to military experts of
the department that the insurgents to
the south of Manila have been taking
advantage of the operations of the
American troops to the north to care
fully drill and make preparations for
the time when an American column
would commence operations to the
south of the city. General Otis' dis
patch to the War Department to-day
rather indicates that the insurgents
now opposing General Lawton. con
templated making an attack on Manila,
and that General Lawton was sent to
break up their organization before
their plans were put into operation.
Dispatches which have been re
ceived from General Otis show the con
stant augmentation of the insurgent
force, his latest advices, dated May 4,
indicating that there were about 9000
insurgents to the south and west of
Manila actively engaged in making
demonstrations. There is a disposition
on the part of the War Department
officials to publicly minimize the
strength of the insurgents south of
Manila, but well informed authorities
say some of the best troops in the Fili
pino ranks are operating in that sec
tion, and are now doubtless opposing
General Lawton's advance.
In view of the resistance of the Fili
pinos, feeling is growing in official
circles that General Otis should be
strongly reinforced, and that the Presi
dent should no longer hesltnte but
should issue a call for volunteers.
OREGONS DESIRE TO
COME THIS WAY
WASHINGTON, June 13.â A cable
dispatch from General Otis, relative to
the departure of the Second Oregon,
states that the regiment will be taken
to San Francisco first, for the reason
that one ship could not carry all of
them, and it was desirable to send with
the two ships sick and wounded sol
diers, a detachment of the Signal Corps
and others who were homeward bound.
It Is said that as soon as the Oregon
regiment arrives at San Francisco the
soldiers who do not belong to it will be
unloaded and the ships then proceed
up the coast to the Columbia River and
Portland. This will be determined by
the time of arrival of the volunteers at
San Francisco.
Major General Otis cabled that the
Oregon regiment was on the transports
Senator and Newport. He said it
would be dangerous to send a trans
port large enough to carry the entire
regiment up the Columbia, and also
that the Oregonians were almost unani
mous in their desire to return by way
of San Francisco. Ââ .;
The department cabled him to use his
own judgment in the matter, so the
regiment will come direct to San Fran
cisco. ____________

PORTLAND, Or., June 13.â The Pinker

These were the words that fell from the
lips of the Rev. Alexander C. Jeffries,
father of the world's new chnmplon pu
gilist. Rev. Mr. Jeffries has for eighteen
year? preached the Gospel of "Him cruci
fied," but bis appearance on the corner of

wagon and addressed a small crowd of
admirers he made a picturesque figure as
' he told of his aversion to prize-fighting.
' His long hair and silky black heard, that

SWEARING A JURY
TO TRY ED MOORE
Rapid Progress in the
Outlaw's Case.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVADA CITY, June 18.â Severn of the j
twelve jurors who art- to try Ed H. Moore |
for the murder of Policeman Kilroy, at
the corner of Broad and Pine streets In
this city in the early morning of March
31, were sworn in the Superior Court to
day. These were, to the surprise of
e verybody. obtained from the first j
twenty-seven freeholders who were ex- i
amlncd. It had been generally believed
that it would take the best part of the
â week to get a jury, but it now looks as
though the introduction of testimony !
would be begun to-morrow afternoon.
Moore is no longer the physical wreck ,
that he was when Sheriff Veale of Contra
Costa County captured lilm at Old Bay ,
Point on the 24th of April, when, armed
to the teeth, he was hastening on his sir
Â«ntional flight to seek refuge with his
aged father, who was living at TemescaL
He is plump and comfortable looking, and
is the same sullen, imperturbable big fel- |
low that he wan before his three weeks'
campaign of hardship in trying to evade \
the officers of the law.
District Attorney E. B. Power is con- '
ducting the case for the prosecution, and
Moore la defended by John R. Tyrrell.
The latter has subpenaed many wit
nesses who have known Moore for years,
and will testify that they believe him
crazy to a greater or less degree. To off
vet this the prosecution will introduce a â¢
-fore or so of citizens who knew Moore
equally well, and believe him to be a clear
headed shrewd fellow, although perhaps i
tfimpwhat eccentric.
The defense will endeavor to prove that
the dead man was inclined to be quarrel
some, and had long nagged and annoyed
Moore without cause; that on the night
of the killing the officer made a violent
and unprovoked attack on him and was
about to raise a club to strike him when

"Jim's no worse than the rest of you,"

The long beard Bhook with the nervous
:ni'l impressive movements of the massive
head of the speaker, but he was appar
ently in a hurry to pet away from the
subject of his pugilistic son to matters
nf deeper import.
"No man can come to salvation exc< pt
through suffering. The Lord cannot know
a man except through pain. You can't

about until I squeal. Then, when I cry
out you will know me and what 1 am.

The crowd kept growing all the time,
and the new-comers would edge up to
those who had been listening and softly
whisper. "Who is the old follow?"
"It's loffries' father." would come buck
the answer In an awe-struck tone. Then
the new-comer would gape at the speaker
with renewed respect

he Interjected, "and I Buppose that's why
sr.nv' men gatn. but all battles arc won
because t!iÂ» Lord has his way. But 1

the patriarch opened a satchel that he
took from the- bottom of the wagon and
took out a printed design that looked like
an ancient '-hart of the signs of the
Zodiac It was labeled "The Chart of
Salvation." and appeared as mysterious

outside the path, but still Inside the inner
circle, represent the 44.MU Levites, who
n -r>re selected by the Lord from the tribes
of Israel. They do not have to work, but
they live on the labor of those outside."
Here the Rev. Mr. Jeffries became much
mixed In theory, metaphor and rhetoric,
and the subject gave way to more com-
CiOnplace phrases. The crowd tigered
and grew, expecting to hear more about
his son. but he suddenly grabbed the lines
and left without a word of explanation
to comfort his patient audience.

BOISE. Idaho. June 13.â 1t was morbid
curiosity that led Leonard McGinney to
"The Hole In the Wall" in Wyoming; it
was fear that caused him to creep away
down the narrow gorge leading from the
hole and make his way to the nearest
railway point. He heard of the plans of
the men who robbed the Union Pacific
train. He knew they would return to
"the Hole," that a posse would likely
follow. He did not want to be mixed in
the affair, so he fUd in the darkness, beat
ing his way to iUiise and going hence no
one knows whither. He came here for
assistance from a frioml who is a news
paper man and the latter obtained per
mission to relate after McGinney's de
parture some of the thinps he told him
of "the Hole" and its Inhabitants.

CHOOSES AN AWFUL DEATH.
Despondent San Jose Girl Takes_Cora
rosive Sublimate.
SAN JOSE, June 13.â Fannie Galindo.
an 18-year-old girl, la dying at the home
of her parents at 371 North Eleventh
street from the effects of a large dose of
corrosive sublimate taken with suicidal
intent. She had been in ill health for
some time and this led to despondency.
On Sunday afternoon she swallowed seven
large tablets of corrosive sublimate and
since then has been In a semi-conscious
state. One grain is sufficient to cause
death and the girl took about fifty grains.
The action of the drug is very slow. Doc
tors entertain no hope for her, but say
death may not occur for several days.
The drug is gradually eating away her
vital organs and she suffers great agony.

IRON MOUNTAIN
MINERS STRIKE
Four
Hundred Workmen
Walk Out.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, June 13.â The great mine
of the Mountain Copper Company at
Iron Mountain was closed to-day. Four
hundred miners and muckers threw
down their tools and walked out, de
claring they would not return to work
until men who were recently dis
charged were reinstated and the min
ers' wages advanced 50 cents on the
day's work. The men were receiving
$2 60 a day. They now demand $3 10.
Most of the strikers left the mine to
day and are now at Keswick, many of
them riding down on the ore trains
and others walking. It is a distance of
twelve miles from the mine to the
smelters at Keswick. As the men are
no longer employes of the company
there were no accommodations at the
mine outside of the company's bunk
and boarding houses and most of the
strikers were consequently forced to
leave. There is no town at the mine,
as there is at the smelters.
The strike at the mine has been
brewing for some time. It is currently
reported among the miners that the
mine is not altogether safe, every level
I in the workings being more or less de-
I pressed or sunk by the superincumbent
; mass. On account of this condition
I bodies of miners have refused to work
j in the past, and it has been more or
less a standing complaint among those
who remained and those who subse
quently have been added to the mine
payrolls.
One thing that forced matters to an
early issue was the granting last Fri
day to the smelter employes an advance
in wages, ranging from 25 cents to 50
cents on the day's work.
The smelter men had circulated a pc-
t ition among themselves asking for an
increase in wages, and before the peti
tion could be presented to General
Manager Wright the advance asked for
i was allowed and posted in the smelter
yards. Yardmen were increased 25
cents on the day's work, matte and pot
pullers 30 cents, trappers 40 cents, skim
i mers 50 cents, charge wheelers 30 cents.
: feeders 40 cents and firemen on re
; verberatory furnace 50 cents.
This liberal action of the company, it
appears, hastened matters with the
mine employes. The organizers renewed
their work and soon had the entire
force with them. A new scale of wages
was drawn up and submitted to the
; company. The 15th inst. was set by the
miners as the date when the new scale
should go into effect. At once a number
, of men were dischargedâ about thirty
; in allâ the pretense being that the com
pany had out enough ore in the mast
ers to last the smelters for a year ahead.
It happened, however, that the men dis
charged were the agitators or leaders
of the strike movement. A day or so
afterward another lot of men were dis
charged anil they also were members
of the strike committees.
The miners at once resolved to throw
up their situations Immediately, not
â waiting for the 15th inst.. the date set
in their demand to the company for an
advance in wages. To-day's general
walkout was the result.
Fell Upon a Circular Saw.
REDDING. June 13.â Quintus X. Atkins,
who was fatally injured by falling upon
a circular saw. in a saw mill near Whit
more, died and was buried at Millville
to-day. His skull was cut open for eight
inches. Atkins was one of the prominent
Masons of the country.

ers of the Idaho mining strikes had been
ill-treated by the military authorities.
This being brought to the attention of
the President, he directed that an investi
gation be m*de.
General Merriam has telegraphed the
department the receipt of his inquiry.
He says when he left Wardner on May 25
he reported the sanitary condition of the
prison as beyond complaint. The building
was heated by Btovea and there was a
large courtyard for exercise. The prison
ers were comfortably housed and better,
fed than the troops. One man was seri-'
ously ill, and he was in a hospital in the
town.

that direction should be made of the au
thorities.

Carpenters and Joiners of America in
Oakland last night Chairman Malsbury
called attention to the mass meeting to
be held in Metropolitan Hall to-night.
"On that occasion steps will be taken."
said Mr. Malsbury, "to register a protest
against the action of Governor Steunen
berg of Idaho and General Merriam in
suppressing the liberties of the miners Im
prisoned at Wardner. These officials are
trying to establish a precedent that they
hope some day 'to use against us.
"I have worked in and about the mines
at Coeur d'Alene and know the miners"
condition. I know how cruelly they are
treatedâ as so many slaves. While I
would be for hanging- those who perpe
trated the recent atrocious crime, I say
it is unjust to imprison hundreds of min
ers, intimidate them by acts that com
mand fear and compel them to sign
statements that the;/ believe the atro
cious crime was the act of the union and
pledging themselves never again to af
filiate themselves with- any union before
they are permitted to go to work. I glory
in the fact that not a man signed.
"Those miners are real men. When
they asked tho owners to retimber the
mines the owners replied that 'men are
cheaper than the cost of retimbering.'
They work In slaughter houses, risking
their lives at $2 a day. I believe when
President McKinley is made aware of the
facts he will right the wrong."

THE CRUISER NEWARK
IS SAFE IN PORT
Evident to the Authorities That She
Has Had a Narrow
Escape.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
- Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don. Bennett.
VALPARAISO, Chile, June 13.âInfor
mation of the safety of the United States
cruiser Newark, cabled yesterday, is con
firmed by this official dispatch, dated at
Port Ancud, yesterday, to the director
of the navy:
The Newark is at Port Low, Guaytecas Isl
ands, short of coal. Her commander asks as
sistance of the authorities. The gunboat Pisa
gun. now at Port Castro, can supply 'only sixty
tons of her reserve Htock.
This was signed by Captain Maldonado,
commander of the warship Pitcomay.
The second dispatch from Ancud read:
I have just received ths following: telegram
from Quill Inlet:
'"Yesterday at 6 p. m. two steam launches
from the Newark arrived at, this j.'.rt. com
municating that the cruiser was short of coal
and had anchored at Port Low. The com
mander proceeds on his journey to' Port Cas
tro, whence he will continue by land to An
cud. He refused tn wait for an answer while
I communicated with my superior. " ' â¢-" '
This was signed by the Quillon port au
thorities. This telegram has been trans
mitted to the commander' of the" Pitco
may:
Await orders.
The Government Immediately ordered
the Pisagrua and Pitcomay to proceed with
supplies for the Newark and render any
assistance required.
WASHINGTON, June 13.â 1t is evident
to the officials here that- the Newark had
a narrow escape. Had she been driven
southward, past the entrance to the
straits, by the storm with her lack of
coal she might have been forced clear into
the Antarctic regions. This experience
of the Newark has served to call atten
tion again to the great risk assumed -in
depriving war vessels of all sallpower.
The immediate effect of the Newark's ex-
as if similar honor would come to

Grand President Mills then read her an
nual address. The review of the year's
work was highly satisfactory. Six parlors
had surrendered their charters, hut seven
new ones had heen formed and five were
awaiting organization. Everything point
er 1 , to the most prosperous period In the
history of the order. The decisions of the
year were reviewed and certain conflict
ing laws pointed out and recommenda
tions for their revision made.
After the opening: ceremonies at the
afternoon session the grand secretary
read the reports of the department dis
trict grand presidents. Almost without
exception the reports were highly satis
factory, showing increased activity and
interest in the work of the order. The
report of Georgle C. Ryan, the grand sec
retary, proved particularly interesting,
both "as to the financial showing and
membership. The latter at the present
time numbers 3135. of whom 620 have come
in during the year just ended. Alta Par
lor No. 3 ranks first in both membership
and finances. The parlor has 240 mem
bers and $1457 30 in f.ie treasury. Buena
Parlor No. 68 is second, with 162 mem
bers, and Joaquin No. 5 of Stockton is
second in finances, having $818 66 cash on
hand.
The receipts of subordinate parlors dur
ing the term have been $20,010 70 and dis
bursements $18,314 11. The amount on
hand in subordinate parlors at the present
time is $14,02! 51. Benefits have been paid
during the term by subordinate parlors
aggregating $4130 30.
The committees of finance, laws and su
Kruu'ir's request for arbitration by other
foreign powers on all points of future
difference had been refused by Sir Alfred
Milner at the Hloemfontein ' conference,
Mr, Chamberlain said the British High
Commissioner for South Africa had been
Bomewbai misrepresented. Sir Alfred
Milner bad distinctly refused to arbitrate
all questions, but had said there might
be some susceptible settlement in that
way, though not by a foreign power.
Mr. Chamberlain then asserted that
since the Bloemfonteln conference Mr.
Kruger had submitted a proposal con
templating that the president of the ar
bitration board should be a foreigner.
SALINAS PIONEER GONE.
SALINAS, June 13.â W. G. Martin, a
pioneer of California and Salinas Valley,
died here this morning in his eighty-fifth
year. He was a grandson of General
Greene of Revolutionary fame and a
cousin of the celebrated frontiersman,
Daniel Boone of Kentucky. He came
across the plains in a wagon from his
native State to California, arriving early
in the spring of isr>2 at Sacramento. He
resided there several months and at
tended the first May day picnic ever held
in California at Sutter's Grove. In Janu
ary. 1868, the deceased moved with his
family to San Jose, and in the spring of
lstiif cam<> to Salinas, where he has eve?
since resided. Martin leaves two daugh
ters, one son and numerous grand and
gTeat grand children..
OPPOSED TO TRUSTS.
AI'STIN, Tex., June 13.â Governor Say
ers to-day received a letter from Gover
nor Roger Wolcott of Massachusetts stat
ing that he would be unable to attend
the anti-trust conference of Governors
and Attorney Generals to be held In St.
Louis September 20. Governor G. W. At
kinson of West Virginia writes:
"I agree with you that something ought
to be done to check the encroachment of
trusts in this country, but somehow the
more we talk against them and work
against them the more numerous they be
come. I am in sympathy with the move
ment and will be glad to attend the meet
ing you suggest, if possible."
pervislon presented reports detailing 1 their
work. Grand Treasurer Lizzie Douglass
reported a gain In the funds of $612 29 and
the amount on hand at present at 14052 80."
The grand secretary read a number of
resolutions and after they were referred
an adjournment was taken till to-mor
row.
The reception of this evening drew out
a throng bo large thai the hall could not
contain all. District Attorney A. H. Ash
ley, on behalf of Mayor Harrison, wel
comed the delegates. Said he:
I know of no greater pleasure to a young,
unmarried man than to welcome other fellows' :
sisters, and I find that marriage causes no per- 1
ceptible diminution of that pleasure. My only
regret is that I cannot sit down a while with
you in the parlor. Therein sit? a womanhood 1
which is typical of our State, hearing the im
press of the State's earlier history, exhibiting
her present progress, hinting at her future use
fulness and power. It is a select body, repre- ;
senting a successful order composed entirely ;
of women, managed entirely by women. A I
worthy daughter of a great State, it never ;
had a parent lodge to turn to, and it has never
felt the necessity of one. It lives by and '
through Its own Independent efforts. And be- I
Ing such, the city of Stockton with her tribu- ;
i tary country, opens wide her arms and says
to its delegates: ""Welcome to my very hearth- ;
sides. Against you no door is closed, for you '
we honor and trust absolutely." Nature's cool j
breath whispers welcome in your ears; her
fields of bowing grain, her scent of new mown
hay, all bespeak a welcome. Old Sol will rise
betimes each morn with a hearty "(rind to see
you, girls," and he'll keep it up all day hut
only in a mere, balmy sort of a way. The
guests of our Native Daughters, you are our
guests. As they enjoy our fullest confidence
and deepest consideration, so do you also.
Grand President Mills responded in a
pleasant address, In which she pointed to
the achievements of the order in the past
and its hopes for future success. A mu
sical programme followed, after which the
evening was devoted to social pleasures.
It was a brilliant gathering-, typical of
the fair womanhood and representative
manhood of California.

THOS. COOK & SON, Agets.. 621 Market at. >AUDITOR WELLS
PLAYED A STAR
ENGAGEMENT
Lees Elected License
Collector.
COMPACT WITH THE BOSSES
IMPOSITION UPON TIFFANY
AND HIS FRIENDS.
Â«
The Auditor Attempted to Carry
Water on Both Shoulders and
Was Neatly Trapped by
the Mayor.
Frederick W. Lees, son of the Chief
of Police, has been elected License Col
lector of San Francisco, to succeeed T.
F. Bonnet. As predicted in The Call
young Lees received the votes of Au
ditor Wells and Treasurer Truman, and
he will he confirmed by the Republican
majority of the Board of Supervisors.
The election of the License Collector Is
the conclusion of a very interesting po
litical episode, in which Auditor Wells
played a star engagement. It will be
remembered that the Auditor and
Treasurer took pains to announce that
in the selection of a License Collector
they would ignore political and per
sonal influences and choose a man
qualified by character and business
training for the place.
Auditor Wells was particularly em
phatic in his declaration that a busi
ness man would he chosen. He ex
patiated upon the advantage of such a
selection, and showed as clearly as
others knew that the office should he
filled by such a man. After these
declarations had been made It seemed
a reasonable certainty that F. W. Lees
would not succeed Bonnet.
Then reports, in every particular cor
rect, were circulated that Chief of Po
lice Lees was laboring with Crimmins
and Kelly to Becure the position for his
son. It was announced that Fred Lees
would sacrifW- the patronage of the of
fice to the Auditor. Treasurer and
Board of Supervisors, and that, with
this understanding:, he would receive
tea -< f W.-Us and Truman. These
reports were vigorously denied. Auditor
Wells going so far as to deny that h"
had promised to vote for Fred Lees,
but takinsr very good care not to say
that he would not vote for Lees when
the proper time came. The Auditor was
playing a rather peculiar gamp. He
was between two firesâ that of the po
il bosses on one side and that of
tantial business men and influen
lerchants on the other.
Auditor Wells had generously prom
ised to vote for F. W. Lees and also
'â  â  William Z. Tiffany. The predica
ment of the Auditor was interesting:,
even if it were extremely uncomfort
able. It was impossible for the Auditor
to keep his promise t" !>oth men. and to
satisfy the antagonistic interests which
Wells Bought to keep in his train On
th" one hand was the pressure of politi
cal threats and promises, and on the
other the force of political opinion, to
-.\hich Wells wanted to how, hut did
to do so.
Downtown merchants and business
men. social, business and fraternal
friends r,f Wells urged upon the Audi
tor t'i \<<tf fur WJlliam Z. Tiffany.
Well? promised to do so and assured
his friends that he would do everything
in his power to elect their favorite. At
that time the Auditor was pledged to
for young Lees. The gold brick
was being gilded for Tiffany. At the
first mpeting of the commission which
ip authorized to elect the license Col
lector Wells was safe. Treasurer Tru
man was abspnt from the city, and
there was no chance that a License Col
lector could he elected. Wells, there
f..re. voted for Tiffany. Lees and his
political supporters smiled, as they
knew the secret Â°f the game and were
willing to permit Wells to carry out his
deception to the end. when, under the
pretense of accepting a necessity he
would vote for I^es.
At the meeting nf the commission,
which was held on Monday, the three
( Vimmissioners were present, and a bal
lot was tak^n. Mayor T'helan voted for
Bonnet, Wells voted for Tiffany and
Truman cast his ballot for L^es. No
apparent agreement could be reached
and none was intended. Wells was to
be permitted to retain his reputation
â¢with his business friends, but Mayor
Phelan took a hand in the game and
provoked an attack of heart failure in
Wells. The Mayor suddenly became
reconciled to the thought of electing
Tiffany, whose praises had bean so per
sistently shouted by "V\>lls. Since a
Tiemocrat could not be elected the
Mayor professed his willingness to ac
. ept a Republican so well qualified as
Tiffany. Mayor Phelan then assured
his associates that on the next ballot
he would vote for Wells' candidate.
This announcement developed a most
unexpected complication. Both Tru
and Wells knew that Crimmins
and Kelly had commanded that Leefl
was â¢ ted, and the will of the
â . as to be obeyed. But Wells
had to make a showing to his business
friends, and he at once proposed an ad
â  of thp commission. Truman
â¢ â  proposal with enthusiasm,
and â¢ n Lesion adjourned until
â  day.
The , k had now been com-,
led. When thecommlssion met
1101 was taken, and Wells
ngain voted for Tiffany, witn the un
tanding thai on the second ballot
he would vote for Lees. This was done
according to programme and Lees was

TABER WAS WITNESS
TO ADOPTION PAPERS
STRONG TESTIMONY IN FAVOR
OF A. C. RULOFSON.
Goes to Prove That Captain Winslow
G. Hall Was the Plaintiff's
Adopted Father When
He Died.
Testimony to prove that Alfred C. Ru
lofson is, as he claims to be, the adopted
son of the late Captain WlnslOW G. Hall
was unusually strong yesterday during
the proceedings in the action instituted
by Rulofson against George E. Billings,
executor of decedent's estate. The case
has been on trial for several weeks be
fore Judge Belcher and the end is not
yet in sight.
I. W. Taher appeared on behalf of the
plaintiff, and was the best witness yet
produced by that side of the case. Mr.
Taber said that in the early seventies,
after Mr. Rulofson, then quite a young
ster, had returned from his trip at sea,
he called on the plaintiff's father at his
gallery in this city, and then the elder
Rulofson told him that Captain Hall
wanted to take the plaintiff as his own
son that he might cart- for him for life.
Mr. Rulofson asked the witness, in view
I (if the fact that his son was not happy
in his home, whether or not it would be
better to let him go with Captain Hall..
Mr. Taber thought it would be best, and ]
j in consequence it was so arranged, Sub
sequently, the plaintiff and Captain Hall
came in. and at that time the adoption
papers were made out. Mr. Taber said
that he signed the Instrument as a wit
ness. By the terms of the Instrument,
witness continued, Mr. Rulofson agreed
to give up any claim upon his son and
Captain Hall agreed to assume the par
ental duties through life, to rare for, edu
cate and provide for his adopted son. Mr.
Taber's recollection of the event of the
transfer of the son was quite clear, and
he even remembered in detail the wording
of the document.
Mr. Rulofson. the plaintiff, promises
several surprises before the rase is end
ed in the nature of proofs that his
adopted father was insane when he made
his will, disinheriting the plaintiff, and
also that undue Influence was the cause
of the decedent's act in so disinheriting
him.

will start for Cape Nome and Kotzebue
Sound to-day on his yacht Townsend, ac
companied by a party of expert miners.
The Townsend was formerly the steamer
Alliance, but a year ago was remodeled \
throughout and named the Townsend. a
month ago Mr. Lane purchased her for
his Alaska venture, and yesterday he
had her licensed at the Custom-house as
a yacht. She is 243 tons net burden, 125
feet long, 27 feet broad and 12 feet deep.
Mr. Lane has already sent north the
schooner Vega with a load of lumber,
and oh the deck of the Townsend
he is going to carry a launch culled
the Goslin. This little thing Is very fast,
and will run between the various mining
camps. The Townsend will go direct to
St. Michael, and there Mr. Lane expects
to find the Vega waiting for him. If the
weather is favorable the steamer will
then take the schooner In tow and a. start
will be made for the gold fields. The ul
timate destination of the party no one
knows except Mr. Lane and he will not
tell. His son is now on Kotzebue Sound, '
and one of his assistants is at Cape i
Nome, while two or three more miners !
are prospecting for. him on the Yukon. j
The chances are that the mine-owner
will visit all these places before the
Townsend comes back to San Francisco.
Considerable anxiety is being felt for
the safety of the British tramp steamer
Port Albert. She arrived here from New
castle, N. S. W.. on May 30 with 4210
tons of coal, and aftdr discharging Bailed
for Seattle on June 4 in ballast. She is
under charter to run between Puget
Sound ports 1 and Honolulu, carrying j
freight, and should now be loaded and
on her way to' the islands. Instead of
that she has not been heard from since i
she passed out through the Golden Gate.
The Port Albert is very 'foul, owing to
being a long time off the drydock. She
took thirty-three days to come here from
Australia, and it was expected that she
would require six days to reach Seattle.
Almost from the time she left port, how
ever, it has been blowing hard from the
northwest. As the Port Albert was light
and very dirty she is probably bucking
Into the northwester, about 300 miles from
home. Captain Marris is -a very careful
and able navigator, and the underwriters
are confident that he will bring his ship
into port In safety.
Herman Hall, a deckhand on the' bay
schooner Addle Gracier,. was probably

because she cannot walk good. She eat

The story of John Kerrigan, the
hack-driver, tallies in all respects with
rou'a tale. "I asked no questions." said
Kerrigan. "The Chinaman camp to me

drive a party out to Cypress Lawn. I

It was blowing hard at the time, and
feeing that there was a chance of losing

Fhis left the captain alone in the'
s.hoonr-r. There were no oars In the
boat and it soon drifted away from the
Addle (Jracier. Captain Johnson tried
several times to put about, but every
tim> the schooner missed stay*. Finally
darkness came down and the captain had
to run for an anchorage. Herman has
not lieon heard from Blnee, and th" sup
position is that ho is drowned. Yesterday
his friends reported the matter to the
harbor police, but they cannot find any
trace of the missing: man.
The Alaska Commercial Company's
crack steamer St. Paul will sail for \las

The contingent will consist of 31S soldiers,

will relieve the soldiers at the various
stations nn the Yukon from St. Michael to
ICagle City. The relieved men will then
come back to San Francisco on the St.

been the recipient of many complimentary
letters from the officers and men whom
he lias < anied to Manila, and it is greatly
to the credit of himslf and Ids men that
the St. Paul can be got ready to go to sea
again at such short notice.
The schooner Defiance, which arrived
from Honolulu yesterday, had a rough
time of it on the oth, loth and 11th inst.
She was caught in a succession of heavy
northwest gales and iost a flying jib, two
foresails and three jibs and broke the fore

things very lively for the crew, and not a.
man in the vessel but what was glad to
hear the command. "Let go the anchor."

The Broadway wharves are not suffi

of the. concern, so Lomhard-stnet wharf
has been assigned to them. It will be
made into a bonded wharf, and all goods
coming here in bond on the company's
steamers will be landed there.
The British ship Lancing has been char

The action of t he San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company against Major W.
B. Hooper of the Occidental Hotel,
brought to test the validity bt the ordi
nance fixing the gas rate at $1 10, was
opened before Judge Sea well yesterday
morning.
The suit is brought to collect a bill of
J631 40 for 360, 50U cubic feet of gas which
was supplied the Occidental Hotel at trie
olci rale <>t ?1 J6 a thousand cubic fei-t.
The defendant sets torth that inasmuch
as the gas was consumed alter me nt-w
rate of $1 10 a thousand cubic feet was
adopted Dy the Doard his bill should oe
computed on that basis. Notwitnstanu

Board of Supervisors and the yis com

\\ Hell the case was caned yesterday
GaVin McNab appeared as counsel tor me
defendant, wniie me company was repre
sented by K. b. Pillsbury, Thomas B.
Hisiin]), ( banes s. Wheeler, William Xix
and uuy c. Earl. Mr. Wheeler hrst
opened the argument on the points in
Issue, occupying the entire morning
session on trie constitutionality <ii tiie or
dinance anil the legality ol us phrasing.
Air. wheeler said mat [nasmucn as tin
ordinance in Question was passed by trie
boatd under an act of the .Legislature
ot 1878, giving the legislative bodies of
cities of over ioo.oko innaoitants tne right
to fix the rates, the act ol the Legislature
referring aliKe to private individuals and
corporations, the present ordinance was
illegal, an H legislated alone against cor
porations. The word Individual was left
out ot the ordinance and in consequence,
the company s attorneys contend, it must
tall.
"The ordinance is also unconstitu
tional," Mr. Wheeler urges, "as it im
posefl Inn dens and regulations upon San
i> raiHisc ". while other towns and cities
are exempt from such regulations." The
decision .it the Supreme * ourt in the
bpring Valley water cast-s were cited t>y
tne lawyer in support of his reasoning.
Mr. H beeler cited authorities sustaining
his position that an act was not a gen
eral act merely because it applied gen
erally to one cuiss. and he hcid that lea
sons should be gi\t - n why a certain class
should be the OOJect of legislative enact
ment, which was not done in the case in
question. He did not see how me Legis
lature singled out San !â¢ rancisco, wmcn
he claimed it did, when it placed the pop
ulation tigure at lOU.UUU instead of a lower
hgun-, suih( iently low to include all of
tne incorporated towns a.nd cities 01 tne.
State.
Mr. Wheeler's argument followed an at
tempt on the part of the defendant's at
torney to admit in evidence the ordinance
passed April 3, nxing the rate at *1 lv,
mat tne light mignt be waged on that en
actment. Mr. .WcNah claimed the rignt
to admit a copy ot the ordinance in cvi-
Q( i i â¢â¢. and (iaa inspector Hipper and As-
Bistant rterk t'arquharson were called to
tesury as to the proceedings ol the board
m passing the ordinance. After the testi
mony was m <iii tne^e matters tne court
refused at the time 10 admit the copy,
but gave Mr. McNab five days time in
wiilcn to file a briet containing the au
thorities upon whicn he baseu his de
mand to aumit the copy in evidence. Jn
the meantime the case will remain on the
reserve calendar, to be again taken up
until tin point under submission has been
decided.
in the event the court holds that a copy
of the ordinance cannot oe admitted vi
evidence me position of the deiendant
will be a difficult one, as it is upon its
provisions that he bunds his defense, if
me ordinance is admitted in evidence and
the court overrules the objection of plain
tiff and decides that the ordinance is not
in connect with the constitution and is
legally constructed, it is understood that
in.- next move on the pan or tne gas
company Will be to attempt to introduce
a copy of the resolution passed by tne
board on Monday, containing the terms
ol the "compromise" effected Detween int
board and tne company. This resolution
reads:
tcesolved, That all existing contro
versies between the city and county
of San Francisco and tne San r'ran
clsco Uas and Electric Company and
Pacific das improvement Company be
and the same are hereby settled upon
the following basis of compromise, as
agreed to by the said ligntmg com
panies with nis Honor the Mayor and
ims board, to-wlt:
1. Kate lor gas to consumers shall be
lixed at the rate of $1 6U per one thou
sand cubic feet of gas; this rate to
take effect July 1, l&>9.
J. Bills accrued and to accrue for gas
furnisned public buildings shall be
paid for at the rate of"Â»l 3o per luuu
cubic feet.
X Bills accrued and to accrue for gas
furnished for street lighting shall be
paid for at the rate ot lv cents per
lump per night, instead of 11 cents per
light per night.
4. Ail electric lighting bills accrued
and to accrue, whetner for sireet
lighting or public buildings, shall be
paid with a reduction ot la per cent
on the lace of the buia rciideied at the
contract price.
i>. If new contracts are let for light
ing public buildings with gas, the said
lignting companies agreed to bid lor
the same at the rate of not to exceed
$1 35 per luw cubic feet.
Through the error of Mayor Phelan in
suggesting tnat the terms of the com
promise be placed in the form of a writ
ten resolution as above he has placed in
the hands of the corporation a formida
ble instrument with which it will wage
Its light if the contest assumes a serious
aspect. The attorneys for the company
will contend, if all other points fail, that
this resolution establishes the legal rate;
that it has a retroactive effect; that its
terms nullify the ordinance of April a,
and hence a defense to an action brought
to recover under the old rate, based upon
the alleged legality of the $1 10 ordinance,
is insuinclent and in consequence such
defense must Tall and judgment be en
tered for the plaintiff.
CAPTURED AFTER A
LONG AND LIVELY CHASE
EUGENE EGAN DRIVES OFF AN-
OTHER MAN'S BUGGY.
An Ex-Convict Who Surrendered Only
When Threatened With
Death.
Eugene Egan, a young man who has
served a term in San Quentin and who
bears a hard name in police circles, led
Officers McNamara. Cook, Donovan and
Smith an exciting chase last night. He
lumped into a buggy belonging to the
Club Stables at the corner of Fourth and
Clara streets yesterday morning and
drove around town at breakneck speed,
visiting friends and having a glorious
time. The loss of the rig was reported to
Captain Spillane. Officer McNamara was
Informed that Egan was on Natoma
street, and hurried to the place. When
the ex-convict saw the policemen he drove
rapidly away. McNamara gave chase and
was joined by Cook.
With the aid of Donovan and Smith
he headed Egan off and the thief
sought escape by jumping from the buggy
and rushing into Sparrow alley, where
he took refuge in an empty house. While
Cook cut off his escape, McNamara en
tered and Egan continued his flight by
lumping off a porch to the landing, a dis
tance of fourteen feet. On McNamara
threatening to shoot Egan surrendered.
He was charged with driving away with
other people's property.
The police believe Egan is one of the
gang that robbed a saloon at Howard and
Fremont streets last Sunday morning.

IN ERNANI
By Ashton Stevens.
<jl â -3 RNANI," thÂ» first of th<=> now
j == 3 popular Verdi operas, is not a
brilliant work at best, so what

tenor it is small wonder there was an
off night in the Alhambra. "Ernani"
stands for Verdi before hp found him
self. The melody is there in abundant
measure, and there is a certain amount
of striking stage picture, but the opera
fails in action from any point you take
it. The orchestration is child's play for
a modern orchestra and child's music
for a modern audience. It is a monoto
nious four acts of a urn pa! urn pa. It
is only fair to say that it was partly the
fault of the opera that last night's per
formance was not up to the I,amhardi
mark. The audience, largely Italian,
received the production with many
tokens of enthusiasm, but the enthusi
asm" was on the wrong side of the fodt
lights.
In the first place Aredano, who from
all accounts sang superbly on Sunday
night in "Aida," was entirely off his
voice, even off the key much of the
time. Obviously he was a worn man,
and it was a mistake to have forced
him. His Ernani was strained, inef-

I fectual and painful to hear. Tt is al
ways painful to hear a gnr:d artint
when fatigrue or illness make him out
to be something decidedly less than
that. And Bardueci. who had the part
of Elvira, was not at her most. She
lacked limbernesa and "steam," as the
sporting critic would say. Travaglini
was quite f< the good as Silvia. He is
a basso of an extremely dignified ter
n: perament. and that found fortunate
vent in the role of the unwelcome lover.
; But the bulk of the energetic work was
\ contributed by Ferrari, as King Tarlos.
i I am not especially enamored <>f his
| barytone, which is forceful, rather than
, fond, but he has the quick Italian ter
n; perament and a fair command of oper
! atic dramaisms. and he certainly earned
i the explosions of applause that followed
i his big efforts.
About the chorus and the orchestra
there is. unfortunately, nothing new to
say. But the scenery was pr"pentable
and the costumes, particularly those of
the principals, were in tast^ and har
mony. The acoustics of the Alhambra
is an improvement on that of the Cali
fornia. "Traviata" is the bill for to
night.

NATIVE DAUGHTERS AT STOCKTON.
ST< >CKTON this year has the honor, the glory
c joy of welcoming the Grand Parlor of
Native Daughters and exulting in the extension
itality to guests whose very presence is an in
on. That all the ceremonies and festivities of
:asion will be successful in every respect goes
saying* for Stockton is one of the communi
rnian hospitality is best exemplified,
;-.rd the Native Daughters know not only how to ap
itne but how to augment it by the
with which they show that appreciation.
institutions in the State are more conducive to
â¢ nil welfare than the organizations which
bring the youth of the commonwealth into close as
sociation for higher purposes than those of social
amusement and enjoyment. It is essential to the de
velopment of every new community that public sen
â¢ should be formed into what constitutes the
ter of the public, creating, as it were, a code of
manners, morals and honor, to which the better ele
iciety can appeal in the contest with the
forces that tend to disintegration and corruption. It
is the existence of such a public sentiment among the
of the New England States that has given
-mail commonwealths -<> much prestige in the
intellectual and moral life of the nation, and when
r sentiment in California is equally strongly
formed the influence of this State will be greatly in
-â â¢'!
Tiie association of earnest, energetic and influential
young women in such an organization as that of the
Native Daughters helps immensely in the work of
developing such a sentiment and fashioning what is
to be the character of California society as a whole.
' the organization are therefore well
ing of the highest praise and honor that can be
given them. In their association they are doing good
service to the community, and merit for their work
as well as for their grace and their beauty the homage
of men.
THE CANAL PROBLEM
SECRETARY HAY has announced the names of
the mi â  the commission appointed by
President McKinley to determine the most
feasible and practicable route for an isthmian canal.
It is said that ;k a whole the commission is regarded
as very satisfactory in Washington. All the members
are reported to be in favor of constructing the canal,
and it is thought they are inclined to the Nicaragua
route, though it is added, "inquiry may change the
minds of some of them."
Whatever may be the view*; taken of the subject by
rity of the new commission, there is one at least
who is not sanguine of the outcome. Lewis M.
Haupt, a civil engineer, and one of the two Pcnnsyl
vanians appointed to the commission, has already de-,
clared a conviction that the new investigation is
simply another means of providing for delay in the
work. He maintains the various routes have been
thoroughly inquired into and that nothing new of
value can be added to the information now in the
ernment.
The opposition to the canal, says Mr. Haupt, is
powerful and active. It never rests. It is composed
of many elements. Among its forces are the trans
continental railroads, the Panama Canal Company,
certain European interests represented here' by what
Mr. Haupt calls "a technical commission composed
of British. French, German and other engineers"; and
List, but not least, Great Britain acting as a Govern
ment, and seeking to prevent the opening of a route
which would endanger her commercial supremacy in
the East.
Either of these forces acting singly is sufficiently
strong to make a dangerous opposition to the great
enterprise, which in itself is one of such magnitude
that many people hesitate to approve it. When united
they make an antagonism well fitted to venture upon
the task of baffling the wishes of a great people, and
a consideration of it as Mr. Haupt declares "is al
most enough to make one despair."
According to the reports from Washington, there
is a belief the work of the commission will require at
least two years, but there is added the statement "the
President desires the commission shall submit a re
p- t during the next =csmoh of Congress in order that
action may be taken toward the construction of the
can?.!." If such be the intention of the President, the
work of the commission can hardly be more than
?. perfunctory visit to Panama and Nicaragua, fol
lowed by a report based upon examinations already
made.
It is not easy to perceive why such a new report
should be deemed necessary when one is already in '
the hands of the President from the Walker commis
sion. There is, however, a gleam of hope in the lat
ter statement, and possibly so far from leading to
procrastination, as Mr. Haupt fears, the new com
mission may be of service in hastening the undertak
ing of the great enterprise.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
THE CALL has uniformly and vigorously sup
ported the principles and the policy of the Re
publican party of the United States. That party
has been a great national organization for forty-three
years, standing for our constitutional system in its
original integrity and completely imbued with the vi
tr.lity and with the energy of American civilization.
Since the election of Mr. Lincoln in iB6O, with the
exception of eight years, it has substantially adminis
| tered the Government. It is not proposed that the
end of the century shall be disastrously signalized by
its defeat.
The Call is in perfect harmony with the resolutions
i adopted by the late Republican convention in Ohio,
which reaffirmed the platforms of the party from Lin
coln to McKinley, and, justly commending the pres
ent administration, disclaimed the imperialistic and
revolutionary policy that expatriated politicians had
fraudulently sought to identify with President Mc-
Kinley and his Cabinet. That convention, held in the
Slate that gave Mr. McKinley to the country-, struck
! the keynote of Americanism and firmly adhered to the
i eternal truths proclaimed in the Declaration of Inde
pendence, practicalized by our fundamental law, ce
mented by our Civil War, with its after-development
of fraternity throughout all sections of the republic,
and wrought firmly into permanent history by the
1 succession of great events, in which the Republican
party has necessarily borne the most conspicuous
' part.
But The Call does not concede and will never tol
erate the pretentious dominance of the Huntington
monopoly over the Republican organization, in its
national, in its State or in its municipal contests. We
favor no abstract theories that would emasculate legi
timate party action by weak sentimentalism or by
sounding generalities. There are two kinds of politi
cal machinery â one that produces effective organiza
tion upon an honest foundation, the other invented to
negative the popular will by impressing parties into
' the service of corrupt monopolies, by fraud, by de
i ceit, by methods that degrade manhood and insult
citizenship.
As it has repeatedly declared, The Call has no hos
tility toward railroads or toward any agency that pro
motes the comfort and the interests of the public. It
1 concedes that no citizen is deprived of a tittle of his
legal rights or of his just influence by the fact of his
business identification even with a railroad monopoly.
But, in the municipal struggle that is to supply San
Francisco with local officers, under the new charter.
as in every other political campaign that results from
our free institutions, it does not propose to submit
and, to the full extent of its powers, it will prevent
the community from submitting to the insolent dicta
tion of Mr. Huntington, either through subsidized
: and powerless newspapers or through any of the mi
: nierous corrupt and corrupting agencies he is accus
trmed to employ. For more than thirty years Mr.
Huntington has assumed the attitude of a czar
toward the people of this State. In various degrees
: and at ditt'erent times he has polluted each depart
ment of government. He has interfered with the pri
mary and ineradicable sovereignty of the people. His
j spies* and his emissaries have pervaded conventions.
have selected candidates, pledged to dishonor^n ad
vance, and have shamefully obstructed the free and pa
tiiotic exercise of the elective franchi-e. No depart
ment of the official service, of business or even of so
ciety has been exempt from their bold obtrusiveness
and from their disgusting methods.
The Huntington monopoly has evinced no prefer-
I ence for any single political organization. It has
operated equally through all. Rut its crowning
treachery was its false pledge of 1808 to the Repub
; litan party that it was "out of politics." deliberately
I and openly repudiated the moment the election was
over, and followed by the obstinate attempt to force
Dan Burns, a mere railroad tool without character or
i qualifications, upon the State as one of its Federal
Senators, and by the more recent wholesale scheme
of robbery, only defeated by six faithful members of
! the local Board gf Supervisors.
The Call, which bore its full part in the death
: struggle with Mr. Huntington. regarded the legisla
! tive deadlock and the ultimate check to the insuffer
! able pretensions of Dan Burns as a vindication and a
; triumph for the Republican party of California. From
' the attitude of the Examiner and from numerous
j other indications it has no doubt that Mr. Hunting
ton's ulterior design was to use the proletarian
Democracy to defeat the Republican ticket in this
I State in 1000. There has evidently been no relaxation
in that malign purpose. There is a natural alliance
between sandlotism and the railroad monopoly, of
which the evidences constantly multiply. Having
j become convinced that the revolt of independent Re
publicans against his usurped despotism was too deep
and too extensive to be controlled, and that the dc
: ceit of 1898 could never be successfully repeated, Mr.
I Huntington has obviously directed his attention to
the elements of population that can be arrayed under
' the banner of fusion Democracy.
The municipal election of this year is of the highest
r importance. The Call hopes for and anticipates Re
: publican success. But to this end railroad tyranny
i and railroad corruption, and the rotten agencies of
j Dan Burns and all other machine bosses, must be so
j thoroughly repudiated that any repetition of the
' treachery of last year will become impossible. From
top to bottom a clean ticket, composed of intelligent
I citizens, not only free from reproach but beyond sus
: picion, must be nominated. Men must be selected
' who are equally averse to the proletarianism of the
I sandlot and to the proletarianism of the railroad, and
who substantially represent the best elements of the
! community, expressed in terms that include both capi
| tal and labor.
The Call will labor for such a ticket. It will de
mand no other tests for candidacy but adherence to
; the time-honored principles of the Republican party,
j which protect individual liberty and the rights at
| tnched to property, competency to perform official du
j ties and absolute freedom from every influence an
â¢â  tagonistic and dangerous to the public.
This is an attitude from which no faithful Repub
lican citizen will dissent, and which also commends
; itself to all citizens who retain their individuality and
; their self-respect. It is the only attitude that will at-
I tract and receive the hearty indorsement of the Na
i tional Republican party of the Union. Let Mr. Hun
tington attend to his own business and cease his
malignant attacks upon this municipality and upon
this State. A railroad candidate for Mayor or for any
other local office is incompatible with Republican in
tegrity and will be uncompromisingly opposed by
I The Call and by other newspapers and by citizens
who identify their party with their country. We sin
\ cerely hope that, for once, the reputation, the intel
: lect and the honor of San Francisco may be repre-
I sented by an unsoiled and unimpeachable Republican
; ticket.
England has sent a body of troops to the Trans
vaal to force President Kruger to submit to the exact
ing demands of British capitalists. It looks as if Oom
Paul's long struggle for the simple privilege of mind
ing his own business is reaching its inevitable end in
failure.
THE SA!N FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUKE 14, 1899.
OPPOSITION TO HENDERSON.
SINCE the withdrawal of all other candidates and
the pledges of support given to Hon. D. B.
Henderson for Speaker by practically the total
Republican membership of the next House there has
seemed to be something of a scramble to find objec
tions to him.
None can lie against his ability, his qualifications,
his strength as a party leader, his readiness and his
capacity for carrying responsibility. The hunt, there
fore, has gone outside all these, back to his cradle,
which was rocked in Scotland, where he was born.
He was brought to this country in his infancy, reared
here and knows no other land. For this he fought in
the Civil War, lost a leg in battle and, before his
â¢wound was healed, went back to the front and led
his regiment to the close. By constitutional require
ment only a native-born citizen can become President,
therefore only a native can be Vice President, or
stand anywhere in the line of succession to the Presi
dency, which may move up as vacancies occur during
a Presidential term.
The constitution requires that "Congress may by
j law provide for the case of removal, death, resigna
tion or inability of both President and Vice Presi
dent, declaring what officer shall then act as Presi
dent." Not until three years after the adoption of
the constitution did Congress provide for the Presi
dential and Vice Presidential succession. It then by
law declared that: "In case of removal, death, resig
nation or inability of both the President and Vice
President of the United States, the president of the
Senate pro tempore, and in case there shall be no
President of the Senate then the Speaker of the
House of Representatives for the time being shall act
as President of the United States, until the disability
be removed or a President shall be elected."
This law, passed in 1792, was before the division of
the country into political parties. It did not occur
to any one then that the Presidency, under such a
provision, might pass from the political party which
had won it at the polls by the President pro tempore
of the Senate or the Speaker of the House being at
tached to the opposition. The statute stood, however,
I for ninety-four years, until 1886. Then, Vice Presi
dent Hendricks having died, and Senator Ingalls
being President pro tempore of the Senate, only the
life of the President stood between the Republican
party and the Presidency. The leaders of both par
ties recognized the gravity of the situation and there
was no opposition to trie statute of January 19, 1886,
which placed the Presidential succession in the heads
of the Cabinet departments, down to the Interior De- '
partment, the Department of Agriculture being ex
cluded, for it had not yet been created, and is now
filled by a Scotchman born, Mr. Wilson. This statute
reads: "That in case of removal, death, resignation ;
or inability of both the President and Vice President ;
of the United States, the Secretary of State, or in case
of his removal, death, resignation or inability, then
the Secretary of the Treasury"- â and so on down to
the Secretary of War, Attorney General, Postmaster
General. Secretary of the Navy and of the Interior â
"shall act as President until the disability of the Presi
dent or Vice President is removed or a President shall :
be elected."
This statute makes ample provision for the succes
sion, and puts the departments in the order of their
seniority, the State Department being the senior. If
a Cabinet position in the line of succession be filled
by an alien born, that is an inability, and the succes
sion passes over to the next. It will be seen also that
it provides that the Presidential succession shall re
main in the party that won at the polls, because
the members of the Cabinet will be always of that
party
Under the law of 1702 only a native-born citizen
could be President pro temporc of the Senate or
Speaker of the House, for the Presidential succession
was placed in them solely, and if both were alien born
they would have been incompetent.
After the statute of 1886 was passed Mr. Crisp of
Georgia, who was born in England, was elected
Speaker and served two terms. It will be. s*en that
the objection to Henderson of lowa, based in the
Presidential succession, loses parallax. Neither the
constitution nor the statute puts the Speaker in the
line of succession.
Rut it is said that the constitution uses the words:
"Congress may by law provide, * * * declaring
what officer shall then act as President," and the at
tempt is made to limit this to the "officers" named in
the constitution, excluding those which are created by
law.
Now the constitution mentions several "officers." It
says: "The House of Representatives shall choose
their Speaker and other officers." "The Senate shall
j choose their other officers and have a President pro
tnnpore." "The Judges both of the Supreme and
inferior courts shall hold their offices." "The Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court shall preside over the
Senate in impeachment trials." The constitution also
creates the offices of Representative and Senator, and
of Embassador and Foreign Minister, so there is no
dearth of constitutional officers in whom to put the
Presidential succession, without interfering with the
i Speaker.
It seems, then, that this opposition to Henderson
is without force or merit, and should deserve no con
sideration whatever. .
The Yosemite Commission has met, and during a
busy session strangely neglected to fill the important
position of guardian. As Governor Gage was present
at the meeting it is not unlikely that the Commission
ers declined to appoint the needed officer for fear that
his Excellency might construe the action as a per
sonal reflection upon himself. He certainly needs
watching.
There is still a prospect that California's volunteers
may leave the. Philippines in time to arrive here for
the celebration of Independence day. There will be
grim satire in the memory of the bloody battles they
have fought, at their nation's command, to prevent
the celebration of another independence day on the
islands of the southern seas.
The fiendish San Quentin convict who stabbed a
guard to the very door of death has been sentenced
to solitary confinement for life. It is tcv be hoped
that his instinct to take human life will live and that
he will satisfy it upon his only available victim.
The movement undertaken to provide playgrounds
for children is one that should have the cordial sup
port of all classes of people. The city abounds in
places of recreation for grown folks and something
should be done for the youngsters.
A Folsom convict has broken the record in murder
practiced as a fine art. He carefully planned his
crime, invited a few of his friends to be present at
the death, and then, in the presence of the admiring
spectators, killed his victim.
The new pugilistic champion of the world has been
somewhat forcibly characterized as the biggest beast
that ever was trained. It is safe to say that the re
mark was not made in the presence or within the
hearing of Mr. Jeffries.

Sir: I have your favor of June 1. I Intend!
to make a visit to the Pacific Coast this sum- !
mer without question, but am wailing Just
now to learn whether President McKlnley
will make the trip. If he does I desire to go
when he goes. If the affairs of the Govern
ment will permit him to go, then I propose
to go in order to study the agricultural con
ditions of the mountain States and Pacific
Coast. I shall not, however, be able to go
when the Association of Agricultural Col- ]
leges and Experiment Stations meets. My [
I trip will be later. Very truly yours,
JAMES WILSON. Secretary.
A letter was received from O. B.
Brackett, pomological secretary of the
Agricultural Department, in reference to
the exhibits of fresh fruits at the Paris
Exposition, and referred to the California j
Commissioners.
California will be well represented at
the Pan-American Exposition to be held
In Buffalo in 1901 If the State Board of
; Trade has its way, as the following reso
lutions introduced by Colonel John P.
I Irish and unanimously adopted show:
Resolved, That the State Board of Trade
will make a complete and comprehensive ex- '
hibit, illustrative of the resources of Califor
t nia, at the Pan American exhibit In Buffalo In
I 1901, and to that end will now call the atten
j tion of the producers and manufacturers of
j the State thereto, and as soon as possible be-
I gin the necessary collections.
Resolved. That the board will also Invite 1
I the co-operation of the other coast States in
order that a full Pacific exhibit may be made.

In which the danger to the prosperity of
! the people of the State by reason of ;
droughts was dilated upon and the neces- j
sity of calling a convention to formulate j
f some plan for impounding the flood waters i
' of the State for irrigating purposes urged, j
The scheme outlined was to have the im
| pounding done by the State and the water i
: distributed to farmers at low cost. The i
' board was Invited to officially lend its j
; aid to the project and join in the call for '
a convention to be held in this city at an
early date;
The $250 donated to the California Club
to aid its recent Industrial art exhibition
was returned, with a letter explaining
that the exhibit had proved a financial ;
1 success and the ladies felt that the money ;
' so generously loaned should be returned i
j with the thanks of the club.
Secretary Filcher announced that the .
! Supervisors of Calaveras County had re
newed their affiliation with the board and
i appointed I. H. Reed and Captain H. A.
\ Messenger as the representatives of that |
i county.
i J. M. Stauffor, representing the National
Export Exposition Commercial Museum ;
lof Philadelphia, appeared before the
board to urge the acceptance of an mvi- !
i tation to send an exhibit of the products j
' of this State. He argued that as the ex
' position would be open from the early I
: part of September until the 30th of No
i vember a splendid opportunity would be '
j afforded California to advertise its varied
products and vast resources to the coun- !
; try and the world. The Exposition Com
i pany, however, demands payment for the
; space occupied, and Mr. Stauffer was In
i formed that the board never had and ;
! never would pay for space: that If the
demand for rental wap withdrawn the in
vitation to send an exhibit would receive i
consideration, but not otherwise.

j and the Blind at Berkeley were held yes
terday in the assembly hall in the depart-
I ment of education; Six young ladies and
! a young gentleman who had completed
the prescribed course were granted dl- {
plomas Â»nd five other pupils were honor
ably dismissed. The graduates were:
Misses Leonora L. Brimmer, Susan A.
Jones, Mabel A. Hlnman, Margarette E. ,
j McGrath, Clara Miller and Susan C. Win-
I ters and Andrew Dcmartlnl. Those re- <
! ceiving honorable dismissal were: Jo- j
\ sephine Hatch, Patrick C. Kinevan. James
I Lewis, Thomas McPeako and Nancy F.
i Stacks.
The largo hall was crowded with rela- !
' tives of the graduates and Invited guests, â 
I and for their entertainment and to give ]
', them an idea of the workings of the In- !
j stitution a splendid programme had been ,
i prepared, the majority of the numbers |
i falling to the lot of the pupils of the in- j
i stitution. After an opening chorus, |
"Lovely Flowers," by the blind students,
: whose eyes are forever shut out from the ;
! beauties of which they sang, the first I
exhibition of the progress made in the ;
: tuition of the deaf was given by Julius
Cavalli, a boy of 12, through whose ears
!no sound has filtered since his birth. His
I vocal organs, perfect as they are, would
be v of no use to him had he not had such
teaching as is> afforded by the institution.
He has been a pupil for five years, and
I the efficacy of the methods employed was
beautifully exemplified when, in a clear
voice, he recited the Lord's Prayer. Each
word was plainly and fully articulated
and the modulation of the voice was well
I nigh perfect. His concluding words gave
the signal for applause.
A class of beginners, under the care of
N. F. Whipple, one of the teachers, illus
trated the methods of primary Instruction ;
of the deaf. Facing the instructor, each
I in turn watched his lips as they formed
' words and repeated them afterward with
out a miss. Those taking part In this |
exercise were Vivian Hill, westley Elmer
and Mabel Luddy. Mayhew Norton, con
genltaily deaf, and Miss Gussie Mast, the
blind prodigy of the institution, gave a
very interesting number following, Miss
Mast reading with her fingers a poem,
Master Norton watching her lips as they
formed the words and repeating the Whole
after her line by line. Bben Gay and j
Miss Lena Erickson gave numbers on the
piano and organ and members of a juven
ile class illustrated methods and appa
ratus used in the instruction of the blind.
A piano quartet by the Misses Busle
Winters, Catherine Morrison. Catherine
Seeley and Rhoda Hill brought the first
, part to a ciose.
Six young ladies of the senior class,
looking as pretty as pictures in their
white gowns, went through a blackboard
exercise under the direction of Principal
Wilkinson. They caught the lesson by
watching the words fall from his lips and |
then wont busily to work putting their I
thoughts in white and black. They were
given two subjectsâ Dreyfus and Andreeâ
and the applause they received showed
how well their work was done. Dreyfus,
judging from the written opinions of the
fair graduates, has many sympathizers
and wellwishers at the institution. As
for Andree, well, the girls had an idea
that it was cold up there.
One of the most entertaining numbers
on the programme was the illustration of
sign language by Andrew Demartini. the
only young man graduating. Under the (
guidance of Instructor Destrella, his pan
tomime was as expressive as language
and made considerably less fuss The
young man imitated the birds of the air
and the beasts of the field, and many of
the thoughts men have, and when he had
finished he was given an ovation he felt
but could not hear. â ':â¢â *.
The next number on the programme, a
sign rendering in unison of America, |
was entrusted to Misses Mabel Hinmin.
Susie Jones and Clara Miller, interpreting
the words of the national hymn with
hands and fingers from the reading of ;
Principal Wilkinson. After this all the
graduates and those to be honorably dis
missed were lined up on the platform, ;
where Rev. C. R. Brown of Oakland ad- \
dressed them, his words being translated j
by Mr Wilkinson. The speaker was full
of praise for the work of the institution
and for the students who had so ably
taken advantage of the opportunities of
fered As a parting word to the gradu- j
ates he said that it was not a question as ;
to the number of talents a person might ;
have but as to the manner he used them,
that he would have to answer on the last j
day. .. . .
The diplomas were then presented,
there was a chorus, "When the Summer j
Rain Is Over," and a benediction to close (
the exercises.

A TENANT'S RlGHTSâ Reader. City.
When a tenant enters premises with the
understanding with the landlord or agent
that such premises shall be kept in proper
repairs during the tenancy, the landlord
or agent is bound to keep to his contract.
This department cannot advise you as ta
what steps you should take to make the
landlord or agent keep his promise.
That is a matter you should submit to
some reputable attorney. Whether a land
lord or agent would be responsible for
damages after having been notified t,,
make repairs if some member of your
family "should be hurt by reason of de
fective floor or stairs" would depend upon
the facts of the case.

Out of respect to the memory of Tim

Board of Regents of the University
of California adjourned their meet
ins after a short session yesterday after
noon: Before doing so, however, matters
of moment were considered and disposed
of: The chair that ha? for many years
been occupied by Acting President Philips
was filled by Judge Wallace, who called
the meeting to order. After the minutes
of the previous session had been read and
approved the regents took cognizance of
the death of Mr. Phelps. A committee
composed of Dr. Pardee, A. 8. Hallidie
and Albert Miller was appointed to draft
resolution of respect, which when adopted
are to bo presented to the family of the
late regent. It was also decided that the
members of the board attend the funeral
and to-day they will leave for San Carlos
on the noon train and pay their tribute
to the memory of their fellow regent.

Addison E. Head and John E. Mason has
been under consideration for months and
yesterday the deal was consummated.
The property is immediately opposite the
Lick School, and in deciding on its pur
chase" the regents took that into consid
eration. The contract for the erection of
the school buildings has been let and as
soon as the bond is approved the con
tractor will begin work. It is expected
that the buildings will be ready for oc
cupancy by November next, as every pos
sible effort will be made to hurry the
work. The lot presented by citizens of
this city to the regents of the university
for the erection of the Wilmerding school
or other uses will be disposed of shortly,
as the hoard has no immediate use for It.
Had it not been down in a hollow it
might have been used for the purpose de
sired by Its donors. ,The site opposite the
Lick School was purchased for economi
cal reasons. The regents expect to re
duce the expenses of both institutions
nearly 20 per cent.
Principal Schwartz, who will have
charge of the Wilmerding school, is in the
East purchasing machines and tools for
equipping the school. Th' regents de
ferred all matters until their next meet

AT WAR OVER

Adding to the Hun-

AN EXAMINER PROGRAMME
THEIR SCHEME TO HARMONIZE
BY ABSORPTION.
ro-Night the Main Issue Apparently
Will Be a Plan to Escape the

,nese two political forces in the com
mittee is a matter of frequent and amused
comment. The Kxaminor has for wec-Ks

recognize important party elements hos
ii;<-- to the discredited county committee
and at the same time give it a controlling

i""d vigorously advocated and opposed.
'i ho pian has lung i>een dibcussed m
secret conferences which cor.stuuiij oc
cur, ana ;it man} of which the Kxaimner's
political manager meets and tries to dit-
Lute to prominent local Democrats who
ligure in the situation. Through Exam
h.er Influence an especial en on to a:
li-.iiKe the programme for to-night was
maae on Monday afternoon at a confer
ence in the office of Attorney Sidney Van
V. yck. Some twenty-five or thirty Demo
crats, including several not members of
the Committee of One Hundred, were in
vited ami several responded. The mem
bers or the Hundred there were: Howard
I'ark. Dr. Beverly Cole. Dr. Leland, L. F.
bartlett; R. V. Whiting, lsidor Gutte,
vsgood Putnam. Sidney Van yek and
j. \V. Reay. Donzeli Stoney, J. Slye and
\V. W. Sanderson v ere among the others
there. Several argued in favor of the plan
ni.d K. V. Whiting was long those who
imposed it as being useless. The upshot
of an hour and a half's discussion was
that no agreement was reached and the
caucus effected nothing definite.
The scheme is ;i shrewd one. intended
to pull the wool _-over some Democratic
eyes and to help some people to the chest
nuts. It is recognized that the Commit
tee of One Hundred is thoroughly dis
credited in the ranks of the party and
that anything it favor.* or that its leading
members favor will meet strong preju
dices against it. Several members of the
Hundred are leaders in district clubs and
will control primary election tickets for
convention delegates, and an effective
primary battle cry will be against 'â¢Com
mittee of One Hundred" tickets.
The scheme now is to "take the cuss
oft" the county committee by adding fifty
or a hundred "outsiders" and declaring
that the committee represents the whole
party; and that the party la harmonized.
.Many Democrats have been quietly asked
if they would accept such appointments.
How this can be done safe it at all has
been much discussed. It is proposed of
course that the control shall be preserved
by the â  \ ..â¢: er-Phelan-Popner-Braun
hart elements anil additions will he rare
miiy supervised. If district clubs were
to choose the new members rows would
be instant, for there are two or three op
poslng factional clubs in every district.
A committee to select new members
would also make enemies and jealousies.
It is proposed to recognize Bu< kleyites
and Kaineyiles, and that would meet
tierce opposition.
But all this would be simply for the
!.^oks of the thing. This done, the pro
gramme is to create an executive com
mittee to do the work preliminary to the
primary- This executive committee
would be the real thing and created to
tarry out the programme. There is nomi
nally nothing for the county committee
to do but to declare the apportionment,
but it Is proposed that this executive com
mittee shall be very active". Ostensibly it
is to stir up Interest in the primary and
"gc-t out the voters." Really It is sup
posed that it would be able to help out
programme "clean government" tickets.
The committee of seven appointed to
recommend a plan of apportionment will
recommend that the legally required ap
portionment be by districts, making the
tickets district ones. The convention will
number about 350. The apportionment
among the precincts of the number al
lotted to a district is a purely party mat
ter. A district ticket may be made up at
large or apportioned to general election
precincts, or to primary election pre
cincts. 'his will be much discussed to
night. The committee will recommend
apportionment by general election pre
cincts as far as possible. giving at least
one delegate to each precinct.
There Is a good deal of haw-hawing
about Sam Rainey's "retiring from poli
tics." It is generally accepted that
Ralney" has effected an understanding
with Phelan and the examiner that if
Phelan is elected the new tire commission
shall not disturb Chief Sullivan or Rai
ney's interests generally. In return he
will sing the old song, "I ain't a politician

Coroner Hill held an Inquest yesterday

Collector, who died on June 10 from In
juries received by being Struck by a
streetcar at the crossing of Hyde and
Jackson streets.. I. S. Rosenbaum of 1402
,la>kson street testified that he was on
the rear dummy of the car waiting for It
to stop so that he might get off, when he I
saw Tlltton walk in front of the car. Till-
Bon seemed to be waiting to get on board
â *i,d appeared to be dazed or in a reverie.
! M. Smith, "a promoter," Robert
Holland, the gripman, and several other
witnesses testified '.hat Tlllson stopped |
between the rails on the left-hand track :
as if waiting to get in the car. When the
i -ir was within three or four feet of
him he stepped directly in front of th.'
dummy was struck in the breast with the !
corner 6f the "dashboard rail" and was 1
knocked down. Tillson was picked up and
helped to his residence near by, but was

When affected with the spells of the
disease he used to go into a stupor. Au

BOY VANDALS
ENCOURAGED IN
THEIR WORK
Passenger Coaches
Are Mutilated.
ALL THE BRASS WORK STOLEN
â Â»- â
SERIOUS LOSS ENTAILED TO THE
SOUTHERN PACIFIC.
Â«
Eight of the Gang of "Forty Thieves"
and the Receiver of the Stolen
Property Have Been
Arrested.
One of the worst cases of vandalism re
ported to the police came to light on
Monday, when five small boys were ar
rested by Detectives Ryan and ODea and
Special Officer Lewin of I the Southern
Pacific Company. Yesterday three other
boys and the junk dealer who Instigated
the boys in their thieving propensities
were arrested.
It was discovered on Monday that four
teen passenger coaches of the Southern
Pacific standing on a side line at Harri
son street, between Fifteenth and Six
teenth, had been forced open and had been
completely stripped of every piece of
brass. Lamps and lamp founts, door
knobs. Jocks, mountings on seats, hooks
and hangers from the walls, plates on the
floors covering kingbolts, cocks of the
cylinders underneath the cars and in
fact, every particle of brass in the coaches
i had been removed.
It was not alone the theft of the brass
articles that aroused so much Indignation,
but in tearing them off panels had been
destroyed and windows broken and other
damage done entailing a loss of about
$1500. If a screwdriver had been used the
loss would not have been half so great.
It was the worst case of the kind that
the Southern Pacific officials have had to
deal with.
As soon as the police were notified De
tectives Ryan and ODea and Special Offi
cer Lewin set out to find the vandals.
They were soon successful and the boys
arrested acknowledged their guilt. They
commenced operations last Wednesday on
the fourteen coaches and had them com
pletely stripped by Saturday. They belong
to a gang known a* the "Forty Thieves."
Their names are: Charles Bowies, Eugene
Murphy, Victor Shureen, Willie Desmond,
John Bowles, Henry Lieeman, Oliver
Moody and Thorn Bradley. ' Their ages
range from 12 to 15 years. When ques
tioned they said they sold the stolen brass
to Morris Sel^njan, a. junk dealer at 25
sons in civilization. For seventy
years the conditions were practically
unchanged, for in 1546 there was noth
ing but a little hamlet clustered on
this peninsula, called Yerba Buena.

In its educational institutions. There
are now eighty schools in Pan Frnn
clsco. having a total membership "f

Scinioi is the crowning glory. In con
clusion Mr. Pheliin said:
"We are told that hlfiher education
Is all lust: that it does not qualify us
f>>r the struÃKle of life; hut this Is
all wrong. Thi book <>f knowledge is
open to the girl .RrnduatP as well a? the
boy. and it is Intelligible to her: but it
is i:..t open and it is not Intelligible to
the selfmade man. Selfmade men are
mere creations of circumstances, but
these boys and girls go out into the
world well equipped f>>r the great
battle."

The Baldwin Ruins.
A. E. Jeffrit â¢<=, foreman in charge of the
removal of the ruins of the Baldwin Hotel
j fire, was yesterday convicted by Judge
Graham of the charge of violating the fire
ordinance ami was ordered to appear for
sentence, on Saturday. On June 7, in ac

Wardens. Assistant Chief Dougherty no
tied Jeffries to tear down the walls on

to the preponderance of girls over
boys who were about to be handed
diplomas, and said that woman was
the natural teacher of the human
race. Why, then, should she not
be intrusted with the duties of citi
zenship? When men of all nations be
come a little more highly educated
they will be as ready to accept
woman's advice in affairs of govern
ment as they are to have it in affairs
of home. He referred to our present
political system, with its easy posi

ing young men, but his advice was to
seek some commercial pursuit rather
than some political clerkship.

and Joseph Broyer and the class, the
boys' voices hlendins most harmoni

President Bf-rgerot of the Board of
Education was then introduced and
gave some pound and wholesome ad
vice to the young men and women. He
spoke of the difficulties the present
board had encountered since it hnd
come into office, and said it had been
compelled by stress of circumstances
to adopt drastic measures in the early
part of the year, but the idea of clos
ing that or any other school in the
city had never been contemplated. He
then addressed himself particularly to
the graduates, saying: "The secret o
success can be pummel up In a fei
words. Select pome vocation congÂ°nln
to you and to which your eapabilltfe
are adapted and strive to master It i
every detail. Never become dtscour
aped, no matter how great the diffleul
ties that beset your path, and whe
the one golden opportunity present
Itself be prepared to grasp It, for i
only comes once In a lifetime."
This was follower) by the all-Impor
tant moment to the graduates, the
presentation of diplomas. President
I't'Tgrerot called the names, and as
each pupil cnme forward Mayor Phe
lan handed him or ncr the coveted
scroll, with a how and word of con
gratulation.
That concluded the exercises, hut for
the next fifteen minutes a half dozen
ushers were kept busy In passing up
floral tributes to the young ladies,
pvery one of whom left the stage look
ine like a huee animated bouquet.
An Invitation to visit the drawing
room and inspect that branch of wi>rk

Broken the Internal Rev

An importHnt seizure of an illi<'it dis
tillery in the Santa I'ruz Mountains was
made yesterday by Internal revenue of
ficers. Acting on Information furnished
the revenue department, D. J. Flannery,
F. A. Fletcher and L. E. Thrasher, ac
companied by J. A. Lovell, City Marshal
of Santa Clara, went into the Santa Cruz
Mountains near Alma and hid in the
bushes surrounding the residence and
saloon of Hank Olin. The officers arriv.-d
at midnight on Monday and made them
selves as comfortable as they could under
the twinkling stars, waiting to catch
Olin going to work on his Still, which thi?y
had been informed he was accustomed to
do between the hours of midnight and 1
o'clock in the morning. When 4 o'clock
came Olin got out of bed, where he had
been peacefully snoring all night, and
went to the stable to feed his horses. The
officers then emerged from their places of
conci alment and arrested him.
Two coal oil cans in the house, one of
them containing a rude worm Â»r con
denser, were seized, together with a gal-
Inn nf new brandy. The Pfarch In the
brush brought to light several gallons
more. Then < >M n btolje down and con
fessed, ill said ho had been making one
gallon of grape brandy out of four gal-
Inns of wine, costing 40 or 50 cents, and re
tailing the product over his bar at 10
cents a drink, a very profitable busi
ness whin there were no taxes to Jnter
fere. He had been distilling illicitly for
only two months. He had no idea that his |
offense was so grave as the officers
seemed to think it was.
When asked whether he knew of any
ntf.t-r illicit stills in his neighborhood he '
replied thai he would rather serve a jcn
tence of twenty years in San Quentln
than "be a dog .>f an informer." Olin was
\>\Â«n to San Jos.-, where he furn.sh â¢.]
bonds and was released. He has been
a politician In a small way and has many
friends. The case will probably be com
promised.

[LETTER TO MRS. PINKHAM NO. 12,733]
"I am very grateful to you for your
kindness and the interest you have
taken in me, ajid truly believe your
medicines and advice are worth more
to a woman than all the doctors in the
world. For years T had female trotibles
and did nothing for them. Of course
I became no better and finally broke
down entirely. My troubles began
with inflammation and hemorrhages
from the kidneys, then inflammation,
congestion and falling of the womb
and inflammation of ovaries.
"I underwent local treatment every
day for some time; then after nearly
two months the doctor gave me permis-
sion to go back to work. I went back,
but in less than a week was com-
pelled to give up and go to bed. On
breaking down the second time. I de-
cided to let doctors and their medicine
alone and try your remedies. Before
the first bottle was gone I felt the ef-
fects of it. Three bottles of Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and a
package of her Sanative Wash did me
more good than all the doctors" treat-
ments and medicine.
"The first remark that greets me
now is 'How much better you look!' and
you may be sure I never hesitate to tell
the cause of my health." â Mes. E. J.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW lORK BTOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June There was a marked
disposition from an early period in the day's
trading to take profits In many of the stocks
â¢which have enjoyed a large advance recently.
This was evident, practically, in all of the
standard stocks and as Increasingly obvious In
the Industrials. The strength manifested by
a. small group of the industrials served to stay
the market for a time and acted as a sort of
cover to the profit-taking sale* which were fed
on the market. The recent strength of Federal
Steel showed abatement during the early hours
of the day and other members of the Flower
group, notably Brooklyn Transit and People's
Gas, were strong In sympathy, and advances
in Metropolitan, Manhattan and Sugar helped
to keep up price*. The leadership of these
stocks gave place in the course of the morning
to National Steel, American Hoop, American
Smelting and Tin Plate, the first named rising
some 6 points. The awakening of activity In
this group, which was more prominent In trad
ing than at any time since they have been dealt
In on the local exchange, seemed to Invite real
izing elsewhere in the list and an early break
in Consolidated â¢>.'. followed by pronounced
weakness in Sugar, emphasized this tendency.
There was a late rally In Consolidated Gas and
Press Steel Car was suddenly marked up to
66, an advance of over 4 points. Hut no effect
was apparent on the general list, which closed
active and weak at the lowest point generally
to-day. Net losses in the standard railroads
are for the most part between 1 and 2 points
Sugar, which was traded In ex-dividend of 3
per cent, lost nearly 5 points on the .lay.
There is an element among the professional
operators which habitually buy Sugar to realize
the dividend and get rid of the holdings im
mediately after the dividend periods. The sell
ing from this source was an influential ele
ment in the weakness of that stock and by
sympathy, of the whole market. Manhattan

A circular from Australia says: "As every
cargo of Colonial coal to arrive for the next
two months has already passed out of first
ban. consumers are thus fairly well supplied,
thus pausing the market her.- to remain steady.
The decreased shipments of Australian in 1898
(SO.OOO tons less than 1597) have forced a num
ber of our large consumers to utilize British
Columbia and Washington products, which for
the moment meet their requirements, bo that
Newcastle fuel is gradually ceasing to be an
absolute necessity here. Furthermore Its high ;
cost landed here has diminished its sale, over
$1 per ton higher than in June, 1897. There are
thirty-four vessels listed as chartered to carry
coals from Sydney and Newcastle for here, ca
pacity of about 90,000 tons: this is 9000 tons
shrinkage since last mail, thus verifying the
reports of a scarcity of sailing vessels in those
ports; at this time last year there were over
40,000 tons more tonnage listed. As grain char
ters are being marked up a fraction, coal car
riers may be diverted in this direction, and we
may Inter In the year he enabled to report
brighter prospects for Colonial fuel In nts
market."

THE STOCK MARKET.
There was a sharp advance in Oas and Elec
tric U. $7.1 on the morning session of the Bond
Exchange. The other stocks were unchanged.
i On the afternoon call Gas and Electric was
I lower at $73Â«72.
Mining stocks were a shade weaker. The
â¢ telegram from the pump said: "Water rising
slowly. Will start eei-ond elevator at noon
and by running half time keep the water down
to near the 1950 level. Repairs on the C. & C.
! hoisting engine will be finished within forty
-1 eight hours."
In the O'lhlr mine, in the Central tunnel
workings, the north drift has been extended
17 feet: total .length. 313 feet; face In quartz
with thin clay seams. By the end of next week
! they expect to be near the Mexican south line.
When they reach that point a 'o'.nt east and
I west crosscut will be run through the vein,
i Miners working on their own account are cx
i trading small quantities of ore from the Cen-
I tral tunnel level. One of these lots of ore is
now being worked, the assay value of which
' is $8 per ton. The Sutro tunnel connection was
! extended 12 feet; total, 181 feet, the face being
i in the first etreak of soft ground found since
j work was started. Work has been continued
! on the quartz stringers and the southwest drift
< extended S feet; total length, 30 feet.
I The weekly report of General Manager Ross
jof the Comstock Pumping Association says:
"The water has been lowered at the following
points during the past week: Hale & Norcross
incline. 3 feet 1 inch; vertical, 2 feet; ('hollar
combination shaft. 2 feet 1 Inch. Water line
below measuring points is as follows: Hale &
Norcross Incline, S6 feet 7 inches: vertical M.5!
feet; ('hollar combination shaft, <W feet 8 Inches
Repairs were made in the OsblMon shaft con
necting drift and the water from the shaft
again conducted to the Sutro tunnel. Another
slight cave occurred In the shaft, cuttlnc off
the air. so that we are unable to reach the
shaft to measure the water. As the shaft will
shortly he repaired from the surface nothing
further will be done in the drift until the
repairs in the shaft to the tunnel are f\ n .
ished.
"The repaired No. 1 elevator was started un
at 2:30 p. m. on the 6th inst.. and with the
exception of a three-hour shut-down on the
night of the 7th to determine the Row of water
into the shaft the elevator has been in con
tinuous operation. This elevator, the last to
be rearranged, shows a greater efficiency than
any we have yet used. Being: forced to stop
the C, and C. hoist for repairs 1 have arranged
to continue pumping and have the elevator
watched and cared for by sending; our men
through the Sutro tunnel. We will run the
elevator long enough to keep the water below
the 1950 level. We expect to do this by run
ning the elevator eighteen hours In each twen
ty-four."

A HEARTLESS
MOTHER DESERTS
HER CHILDREN
Four Little Ones With
out Food.
WENT THE PACE THAT KILLS
MRS. MAMIE GRIMM PROMPTED
EY POVERTY.
Went Through a Fortune of $50,000
and Then Seeks the Love of
Another Woman's Hus-
band.
ALAMEDA, June After running
through a .fortune of nearly $50,000 within
Tht> short space of three years and being
reduced from affluence to poverty. Mrs.
Mamie A. Grimm of 1236 Park street de
serted her four little children Sunday
night to seek the company of Joseph A.
Mclsaac, until recently assistant superin
tendent of St. Mary's Cemetery, Oakland,
â who was Infatuated with her to the de- I
gree that he had given up his home, his
position and social standing to enjoy the ,
companionship of the man.
Behind it all Is a story of a parent's
heartlessness and a man's perfidy. When
Mrs. Grimm realized this morning that
her little ones were probably suffering
fur food, the maternal affection triumphed
over hor baser nature and she hastened
back to her home, only to find that her
offspring were being cared for by
strangers and that the hand of the law
had intervened to separate the innocent
little ones from an unfeeling and un
â¢\\orthy parent.
The names of the children are Mamie,
aged 11 years; John, aged 8; Fred, ageÂ«l
6, and Fidelia, aged 5. According to th^
statements -"made by Mary and cor
roborated in a measure by Mrs. Grimm
and the man upon whom she lavished her
affections, the chlldnen were put to bed
Sunday night rather early, and a little I
later Mclsaac rang the doorbell. About i
? o'clock Mrs. Grimm and Mclsaac left j
the house together. It was not an un- 1
usual thing, so Mamie says, for her
mother to go out nights, but until this ;
last experience she always returned be- j
fore morning 1 .
When Monday came and the mother ;
â failed to put In an appearance. Mamie as- |
Fumed the responsibility of caring for her
little brothers and sisters. She undertook
to prepare breakfast., but found the cup
board bare. Then the little tots played
out in the street throughout the day with- i
out a morsel to eat and without ever a -
word of complaint. When nightfall came j
they huddled together on the front steps,
afraid to enter the dark rooms of their
home, and tried to sleep. They attracted
the attention of the passers-by, and In
reply to the question why they did not
go into thf house answered that th(
were afraid.
Thp police were notified of their pitiable
plight and Officer William Schumacher
was detailed on the cas<\ He turned the |
mattor over to the Catholic Ladles' Aid
Society and they cared for the little ones
during the night and until this afternoon,
when they were taken In charge by the
representatives of the Eureka Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, of j
San Francisco.
Mrs. Grimm returned to Alameda this j
afternoon and at once commenced a I
search for the children. She was told by ,
Police Sertreant [Camp that they would j
be*-takeh from her. and she replied thrift
both she find they would probably be bet
ter off. She sought out the house where
tno littU- ones were being cared for.
When Mamie saw her mother approach
irg sho begged to be protected, claiming
That if hÂ«Â»r mother got her hands on her j
she would hc-at her to death. i
Mrs Grimm was not allowed to Bee the i
ohildrVn. but the police had to be ap
pealed to to get her away from the house.
She promised; however, not to Interfere ,
with them in the future.
Mrs Grimm was an nnlv daughter of
T>r and Mrs. Kelley of San Francisco, I
both now dead. Her father Is represented
to have been one of the most prominent
practitioners in the city. He left an es
tate valued at $30,000. which was divided
enually between 'â¢;â :- widow and daughter.
Vpon'the death of Mrs. Kelley about
three years ago her share, then estimated i
to be worth $30,000, also went to Mrs.
Grimm. , _, , _ ,
Mamie Kelley married Charles Grimm
about twelve years ago. Their domestic
lifp was happy until the husband took
to rink and a separation followed, al
though the couple have not been divorced.
After Mrs. Grimm inherited her mother's
estate she began to go the pace that kills,
until now her fortune has dwindled to
nothing. Extensive holdings in Alameda ;
realty have been mortgaged and fore,
closure proceedings are about to be com
rn^nced.
Joseph McTsaac. with whom the woman
went away, has a wife and two children
living at the corner of Howe and Mather
streets Oakland. His neglect of his fam
-Ilv was brought to the attention of the
directors of St. Mary's Cemetery. After
investigation they advised him that he
â would have to forsake the Grimm woman
or his position as assistant superintendent
of the cemetery would be declared va
cant He preferred the illicit love to
amending his ways, and another man \
now holds the position he once occupied. ;
He returned to his father's home this
morning, where he was communicated
with by a Call representative. He would
not state why he had not returned to his
wife and children, but admitted that he
had been with the Grimm woman.
Mrs. Grimm's only explanation of the
escapade is that she had made a mistake
vnrt expects to suffer for it.
"Law's Resignation Asked
OAKI kHt> June 13.â The trupteea nf
hurch of the Advent held a meeting
to-day and decided to give Rev. Marshal
POSTUM CEBEAL.
FOOD IN LIQUID
Makes a Full Meal for a Book-
keeper.
I am a bookkeeper in a large grocery
and consequently meet a great
many people. We find large numbers
ho are troubled with the
effe< I know only too well
how thise with them, for- I
have so much from stomach
trouble caused by the use of coffee.
About two years sÂ«go one of your rep-
resentatlvee gave me a sample of Post-
um. and I v as glad of the opportunity
to try something that would furnish me
with a good morning beverage, but not
give me the trouble that coffee did.
The reason Si .. fail to make i
pood Postum is thai they undertake to
pet the pood out of the cereals by a few
minutes' boiling, wh t less than
twenty-five minutes should be used in
making a good potful of Postum. When
it la properly boiled, it is. a most deli-
cious coffee, and a perfect drink in i
every respect. Often when T have had
no appetite for solid food. I could par-
take of several cups of Postum, ami feel
-fully nourished until the next
meal. I have been glad to tell custom- j
era of the eo-mfort and relief they could j
find in the use of Postum. Naturally
we have augmented our sales greatly (
on It, until now we .send out hundreds
r.f packages In a year, one of our cus-
tomers to whom I recommended it has
just been in. and tells me they have all
grown very fond of Postum, including
several members of the family wb
Side in different parts of the State.
With best wishes, F. Latlmer, 1274 Mar- I

Law, rector of the church, one more week
In which to hand in his resignation. It
was agreed that if the rector did not re

nounced by Speakers.

rough scoring from these speakers and
the fact that the unjust contractors, who

$26,000 below the appropriation, had been

torman named Hunter for the place, and ;
the latter won >> T it. The Mayor said if
I not vote f.,r Hunter he might be
credited with passing out a gold brick.

ALICE CAMPANA HAD
ONE LOVE TOO MANY
OAKLAND, June 13.â Although sixty grains of carbolic acid are consid
ered a fatal draught, Miss Alice Marquet, whose true name is Alice
Campanu, took 880 prams when, in a fit of despondency over a love af
fair, she attempted to end her life yesterday, and to-day she had re
vived sufficiently to express her regrets that the awful dose was not effect
ive. "1 do not want to live," she whispered this afternoon at the Receiv
ing Hospital, "and as soon as I got better I will move to San Francisco, en
gam B room there and turn on the gas, bo as to make a sure job of It next
time."
The young woman still refuses to give a reason for her rash act. She says
she will never return to Captain Morrison's home on Jackson street, where
she acted as housekeeper and where she attempted to commit suicide. It de
velops now that Captain Morrison is not her uncle, as was claimed. Mrs.
Kilza Btlles of 2238 Peralta street makes that denial authoritatively, for
.she is the captain's daughter.
It turns OUt also that Harry Troy, the San Francisco saloon-keeper, was
not the. only oik; who held strings on Miss Campana's heart. Joe Her-
M>riiig brother of the young woman who found Miss Campana in a dying
condition, now frankly admits that he was engaged to marry the would-be
suicide, and tha wedding was to come off on June 21. Hersprlng says that he
knew his fiancee also kept company at one time with Troy, but he supposed
that matters were pretty well settled. He also says that on last Thursday
Miss Campana threatened to jump intn Lake Merritt. Herspring was to have
tone on the road as a .hummer yesterday, but this affair has lost him his
positfon. Late this aft. moon the girl's stepfather called at the hospital, and
wept bitterly because his daughter bad disowned him.
It is seriously Iviieved now that Miss Campana tried to end her life be
cause Wio found herself in the dilemma of not knowing whom of her two
lovers she loved the more.

"That's one of her jokes." said Papa <
Keffer, the Eleventh-street merchant, as I
he returned from a picnic with his wife
last Sunday evening. But it was no jokeâ
It was an elopement.
George Moore, a young contractor of
Berkeley, has loved pretty Josie Keffer
for throe yearsâ since she was 15 years
old. Ills parents looked on the match ap
provingly. Jusle's parents thought her
too young, and wanted her to travel and â 
see more of the world before she mar
ried. They did not object to her marry- |
ing Moore, hut opposed haste.
Last Sunday Mr. and Mrs. Keffer went
to a picnic at Glenwood, In the Santa
Cruz Mountains. When they returned (
they found a little note from Josfe. They
expected that it was the usual noteâ "will
be back on a late train." Josie had never
spent a rrfght away from home in her
life, but had frequently crossed the bay
with her sweetheart and left a little ;
note. But the note of last Sunday was
very different, and when her papa read
It he remarked to his wife that it was
just one of Josie's jokes and that she
would be. hack before the last train. Not
until the last train had crossed Broad
way did her parents admit that the little j
billet was the tiuth.
When the Keflers had fairly started on
their trip Miss Josie met her suitor and
proceeded to Berkeley, where the Moores
had made all the necessary preparations
for a hasty marriage A minister was
present and a license had been procured
quietly, bo there was no hitch. Josie'a
age just permitted her t" exercise her
own discretion, and as she had no big
brothers she felt perfectly at ease.
After the wedding the young couple left ;
for the Santa <'ruz Mountains, and on
the way down they pass.-! the train that :
was hurrying the bride's parents back to
the little surprise awaiting them.

THE BELDEN CASE.
Police Working on the Theory That
"Cheesman Was Not Involved.
Tho Oakland police have about given
up tho theory that Cheesman made the
assault on H. K. Be'.uon last Saturday
night. They claim the man has designs
upon the life of Mr^. Knick only and
that he would not attack any one else.
They worked all day yesterday upon a
lead In the case furnished by a woman
In East Oakland.
The clew came from a Mrs. Atkln of
East Oakland. She. was fixing up her
house and expected a carpet layer to
come to lay her carpets. One did come,
and after borrowing the necessary tools
he set to work. He paused long enough
to nsk if she was alone In the house, and
When she told him she was he picked u;>
his hammer and showed a desire to speatc
familiarly to her. She backed out of th->
room, saying in answer to one of his
â  I nest ions" that she was not afraid to lie
in the house alone with a strange man.
and final' y she reached a back room
where on the bureau there lay a pistol.
This she picked up, and the man asked
her if she was not afraid to use it. Slu
said no, and he left the house, saving ha
had to go after his lunch. His descrip
tion was very like that of Cheesman.
She learned later that no one had been
sent by the firm she expected to lay tlia
carpets. This happened on Friday last,
the day before the assault on Belden.
This clew was run down ps far as pos
sible and resulted in nothing of impor
tance except to establish the fact that
Cheesroan mitrht have been in the neigh
horhood. A little later in the day Charles
Carlton telephoned in to the police sta
tion that Cheesman was asleep in a barn
in North Oakland, and immediately Chief
Fletcher and two detectives went out in
the patrol wagon to make a capture. The
man asleep turned out to be a tramp.
however, and another lead had been found
valueless.
Last nie-ht Belden visited the Chief of
Police and had a long talk with him. He
w-as asked by the Chief to say if there
was any one who had m any wav a reason
to make such an assault upon him. and he
swore there was no one. He was asked
particularly if there was any woman who
had any reason to se^k harm to him, and
again he swore to the chief there was no
one. man or woman, who should wish him
an Injury. Nevertheless, the Oakland po
l'ce are working on the theory that there
is a woman in the rase and that Chees
man had nothing to do with it.

SMELTERS TO CLOSE.
Combating the Eight-Hour Law in
Colorado.
DENVER. Col., June 13.â The Omaha
and Grant smelter ami the Globe in Den
ver mid the smelters in the trust at Pu
eblo and LeadvHle probably will be blown
out by to-morrr>w nifjht at 12 o'clock on
account of the Inauguration of the eight
hour law In Colorado and the failure of
the trust managers to aprree with the em
ployes in the matter of hours and wages.
The managers to-day ordered the super
intendents to "blow out" the furnaces.
By the closing of the Grant and Globo
smelters in this city about 1100 men will
be out of employment. Neither the man
agement nor the men expect the closing
will be for long. The union has assur
ances from Mr. Grant that he will not
operate his plant with imported men.
Recovers From a Snake Bite.
SANTA ROSA. June 13.â John Bailess, a
y<ung man of about 20 years and the son
of a prominent resident of the Lagnna
district, was bitten by a rattlesnake sev
eral Hays ago. The Tangs of the reptile,
filtered just above his eye. It was be
lieved that his life could not be saved,
but by careful attention he has been pull
ed through and is now pronounced out of
danger. The recovery of ' a victim of a
rattlesnake bite is unusual, and that
young Bailess has not in any way been
affected is considered remarkable.

JOCKEY WOODS COMPLAINS
OF A BROKEN CONTRACT
Tod Sloan's Laurels Are
Intact,
midget Jockey, who went" to
Engl.-md with an nmbltion cf
equaling, If not taking the lan
rels from. Tod Sloan, America's pre
niltr rider, Is a disappointed lad, Judg
ing by the letters he has written his
]>art-iiiH and the action they propose
taking in his behalf. The young- rider's
fathi-r has through a well-known firm
of lawyers in this city drawn up a
power of attorney and other legal
measures and ordered them forwarded
t> a solicitor in London, with instruc
tk>ns to file immediately an action
against Alec Coving-ton, the well
known horse-racer, for breach of con
tract.
Early in March last Coving-ton.
through his brother, entered into a
contrin't with young Woods to ride
for him In the Haymarket races. Rosy
inducements were offered the clever
little jockey, and on the advice of ...s parents he signed the document and
left shortly afterward for English shores. According to the contract Woods
was to be paid $:joO down and his passage to and from Europe. Besides that
he was to receive $100 a month, enjoy the services of a valet and was grant
ed the privilege of outside mounts. As the latter would recompense him at
the rate of $26 for first and $13 75 for losers the boy counted on bringing
bark a snug sum at the end of the season. He was scheduled to arrive In
England on the 21st inst.. but arrived two days before the time specified.
In the meanwhile Covington, evidently forgetting about his contract with
Woods, succeeded in reducing his own weight to 114 pounds and was able to
qualify as a Jockey. Young Woods was therefore astounded on his arrival to
learn that Covlngton would ride and was even more surprised to be Ordered
to the stables and act as exercise boy. Covlngton did allow Johnny to ride a
few times, but as the entries were ordinary mounts Woods could not do better
than fourth.
Woods is only 16 years old. but ha? won a namo for himself in the racing
world. When but 14 years old he led the Chicago jockeys in the list of win
ners. During the past season he raced at Ingleslde and Oakland and made
an excellent showing. Covington appreciated his value as a "pilot" and in
duced him to go 1o England, but according to the lad's parents did not
live nn to his contract.

have the first inning, presenting- Charley
Goff and Jim Franey. Ihe middle-weights,
in the main event. Joe Reay, the Olympic
Club boxer, and "Dummy" Rowan will be
the principals in the curtain-raiser.
Both bouts promise good sport, and ac
cording to the knowing ones the men will
not need the full twenty rounds to settle
thjpir differences. Hiram B. Cook has
been prevailed upon to reconsider his de
termination to retire as a referee, and
will pass upon the merits of the men if
his services be required.
Tim ilcGrath, who is conditioning Fra
ney and Rowan, is delighted with their
showing in training. Rowan is deaf and
dumb and the end of the round must
be signaled to him. MeGrath will be his
flag lieutenant and will wigwag his sig

is a close personal friend of McGrath.

STORY CONCERNING
GAGE'S RESIGNATION
The Governor Seems to Be
Amused at the Idea of
Retiring.
Outsiders Figure That the Los Angeles
Law Office Is in a Bed of Clove" at
Sacramentoâ Annual Income.
GOVERNOR GAGE, accompanied by
his wife, arrived In the city yes
terday from Yosemite Valley. At
â the Palace Hotel during the afternoon
and evening he saw several politicians,
among them D. M. Burns and Frank
Mclaughlin.
Speaking of futuVe appointments the
Governor remarked that the Code Com
mipsion and I^abor Commission were
about the only places remaining on the
list. He did not say when the appoint
ments in this respect would be an
nounced, but indicated that they would
not be made before his return to Sacra
mento, as he had no blank commissions
â with him.
In referring to his Yosemite trip, he
Fpoke of his early visits to the valley
iuid his familiarity with that region of
the Sierra Nevada*. He mentioned that
he dirt not visit the valley on his recent
trip for pleasure. ( official duties required
his presence at the annual meeting of
the Hoard of Yosemite Commissioners.
Responding to inquiries concerning
the vacancy on the Hoard of Repents,
1 by the death of Timothy Guy
Phelps. the Governor said h>> had given
no thought to the subject. On this
topic he added: "When the proper time
comes I "will name a man for this im
portant office. I appreciate the respon
sibilities of th*> trust and will look over
the whole State to find the best man for
the position. I may discover that some
prominent section of California is with
idequate representation on the
Board of Regents. T will listen to sug
pestions. but will use my own judgment
In the selection of a man for the place.
iurse T hasre v own judg
ment in regard to appointments hith
erto made, but in this particular case
J intend to lrn->k over the State to find a
nt acceptable in every respect."
The Call is informed that Governor
Gape. 0:1 sevi -asions recently
spoke of from the office of
. eof i Jalifornia. He is re
having said in conflden
mal friends and
â -' advisers: "I am sick
of this constant pulling: and
hauling and have made up my mind tn
quit this political business and go hark
To the practice of law 171 Los Angeles
and the â : . I rmy home life on the
ranch. T am utterly disgusted with poli
tics, political bosses and place-hunters.
I am ready to give up the job and let
Tncle Jake Neff run the machine for
the rest of the term."
It is said that th>- Governor o n more |
than one oorasion expressed a d<
mlnatlon to retire to private 1 i f â¢=>.
At the Palace Hotel last evening the
Governor was asked if the story was '
straight that he intended to resign.
The inquiry seemed to afford him
amusement, but h<Â» did not admit nor i
deny the correctness of the report. De- j
Bpite the fact that men pretending to
speak from Inside knowledge of the
Governor's intentions assert positively;
that lv- has threatened or promised to
Tr sign. The Call does not vouch for the '
MADE A PRACTICE OF
STEALING FALSE TEETH
AJ/EXAXDER BRKCKINRIDCJE. who gave the name of Alexander Jamie
son when bookfd at the City Prison yesterday afternoon by Detectives
Reynolds and Dinan on charges of grand larceny and petty larceny. Is
said to be a relative of the famous Congressman Breckinridge of Ken
tucky. Hf- has been employed by Dr. E. O. Cochrane, dentist, for the past
ten years and was always looked upon as an exemplary young man. His
mother Is a widow, and was heartbroken when she learned of his arrest.
Dr. Cochrane had l>een in the habit of sending Breckinridge to J. H. A.
FnlkfTs & Brother, Kls Market street, to purchase false teeth. The firm
truetari him explicitly, but as they had been missing cards of false teeth
since January last they became suspicious of all their customers, and
finally suspicion fell upon Breckinridge. A few days ago they communicated
their suspicions to the police, and Detectives Reynolds and Dlnan were de
tailed on the case. They saw the members of the firm and advised them
to set a trap for Breckinridge the next time he called. The suggestion was
that they should count the number of cards containing false teeth shown to
Brockinridge and Bee if any were missing when he left.
On Monday Breddnridge called at the store and asked as usual to see
some teeth. The suggestion of the detectives was acted upon, and after he
had been shown thr- teeth the cards were counted and two were found to be
missing. Breckinridge was locked up in the laboratory and the detectives
were sent for. They searched him, but could find no trace of the missing
cards. A coat hanging on the wall was examined and the two cards were
found In one of the pockets. Breckinridge then broke down and confessed
his guilt.
It was not the teeth that Breekinrldge -wanted to steal but the platinum
screws attached to them. He destroyed the stolen teeth and sold the plat
inum screws to assaying firms, among: them Hugo Landecker & Co., 118
Montgomery street, and V. Hauser & Co., 321 Montgomery street. It Is esti
mated that his steaUngs will amount to thousands of dollars, the firm ?seing
unable to estimate the exact value of the teeth and platinum.
What Bnckinridge did with the money is a mystery. He appears to be a
simple-minded young man, who might easily be led astray by designing
people. He is very careful as to his toilet in the prison and has a looking
glass and brush and comb for his own use.
' accuracy of the report. On the other I
j side, the mere assertion of the Gover
: nor that he would resign cannot be ac- i
cepted as conclusive proof that he {
would not resign. All agree on the prop
osition that no one is holding him from
resigning and all admit that the report
of his resignation fails to produce a
protest against the Executive's exercise
df that privilege.
General Barnes has withdrawn from
the contest for United States Senator.
His example has been emulated by U.
S. Grant Jr. Now why should Governor
Gage hesitate to make a sacrifice for
the peace and, good of the common
wealth? lieutenant Governor Xeff is In
good form, ready and perhaps willing
to grasp the helm of state. Should he
get discouraged or fatigued Thomas
Flint Jr., President of the Senate, is
next In line and eager for a chance to
acquire distinction.
Dull people, who fancy that money is
everything in this world and fame noth- ;
ing, argue that Gage will not resign j
because the law office is doing better |
in Sacramento from a pecuniary point ,
of View than it ever did in Los An
geles. For instance, the Governor draws
a salary of $6000 per annum; Private
tary Foley receives $4000 a year;
Daniel Kavane, secretary of the Board j
Of Kxaminers, gets $3000; Mr. Fox, the
stenographer, $1600. and th>- porter from
the law office gets $1200. Aside from the
foregoing the Governor has a secret
service fund of (6000 per annum. The j
amount drawn from the public treasury I
is therefore $20,800 per annum. In four j
years th<-> sum will reach $53,200.
i )ld timers in the law and veterans in
the political arena figure that it would
not be prudent for the Governor to re
sign. They are willing to wager that I
the story of his resignation is a canard.
The story comes to The Call that
would resign if Burns and Herrin
were not urging him to hold on to the
reins of authority, so as to enable them j
to control appointments in the future.
UNKNOWN MAN KILLED.
He Was Found on the Sidewalk "W
His Skull Fractured and Un
conscious.
An unknown man wits brought to the
Receiving Hospital yesterday with a frac
tured skull. He died shortly after arriv
ing there and was taken to the Morgue.
The man was seen by the motorman of
the Sixteenth street electric car on Its
home run at 12:45 p. m. lying on the side
walk at Bryant avenue and Sixteenth
street. When the car arrived at Folsom
street the motorman informed Officers T.
Connell and C. Barnes of the man's condi
tion; ihe officers found him as described
and rang- in for the patrol wagon. ( Ifflcer
' '. H. Taylor accompanied the wagon and
brought "the man to the Seventeenth
street station, where it was discovered
that he was partly unconscious ajid se
verely injured in the front part of the
head. Captain Gillin ordered his removal
to thÂ« Receiving Hospital. In his coat
pocket when searched at the Seventeenth
street station a bottle about half full of
whisky was found and a package con
taining eight grains of strychnine.
When questioned aboul his name he
tried to articulate the name of Kennedy,
or Kenny.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 14, 1899.
HIS LIFE'S WORK
IS AT AN END
PASTOR OF SACRED HEART CHURCH
PASSES AWAY.
REV. FATHER JAMES FUDOD. pastor of Sacred Heart Church, died
yesterday afternoon at 1 o'clock, at the priests' residence on Fillmore
street, near Fell. Father Flood had been 111 with typhoid fever for
four weeks past, and his death was not entirely unexpected. After he
had passed the twenty-one days' crisis it was thought that he might
rally from his sickness, but he kept getting weaker until the end came.
Yesterday morning Archbishop Riordan administered the last sacraments
to the dying man, who passt-d away, conscious to the last, surrounded by
Fathers Cullen and Byrne, his assistants In the parish work.
Father Flood was a man of scholarly attainments and a learned theo
logian. In addition he was an able financier, and the magnificent church edi
flce on Filimore street Is a monument to his efforts in behalf of the welfare
of the parish, He was beloved by all with whom he came in contact, and
especially was he regarded with deep veneration by the Dominican Sisters,
to whom he offered a haven In the old church residence when St. Rose's
Academy was burned out on Golden Gate avenue six years ago
Father Flood was born in County Meath, Ireland, in IBSL He studied In
the eehools of his native place, and then he went to Ballymaclugh, the nur
sery of priests f>>r foreign missions, where he received bid classical educa
tion. In IS7O he entered All Hallows' Foreign Missionary College in Dublin,
and after some years he went to San Sulpice, Paris, where he was ordained
in 1875. Soon aft.-r he came to this city.
Father Flood has been assistant pastor at St. Francis. St. John's ann St.
Peter's churches, and was for several years secretary 10 Bishop Alemany,
whom he served faithfully.
Father Flood wai= appointed pastor of Sacred Heart Church in ISR", and
the growth of the parish has been duo to his earnest and laborious work In
its behalf.

He Will Go to New York and Attend

E. W. Runyon, president of the Paris
j Commission, has written to his confreres
! regarding his interview with General Peck
: in Chicago. Mr. Runyon will go to. New
I York and attend the conference t there.
' His letters, which are attached, will tell
of his efforts in behalf of the State:
AUDITORIUM HOTEL.
CHICAGO. June 8, 1899.
California-Paris Commission, Occidental Ho
-1 tel, San Francisco, Cal.â Gentlemen: I find
: the commissioners here almost at sea as to
dividing the space i which is limited) to the
different States. General Peck received me
very graciously and will do all In his power
â  for California, we representing the largest ap
propriation of any State In the Union. .Massa
-1 chusetts comes next with $60,000. Only four
States have irfade a separate appropriation. it
is absolutely Impossible to obtain .sufficient
! space for a collective California exhibit In the
main exhibition building. Every State has
' wanted this, but not one has met with success.
General Peck finally agreed to Rive us suffi
! cient space at Vincennes, which is seven miles
from the city, to put up our own building and
have exclusive use of it for California ex
hibits, provided the French officials agree.
, General Peck has cabled Paris for this con
. cession and we are now waiting for a reply.
! Should this be granted it will be only to the
four States which have made appropriations
! and are willing to apend part of it on their
buildings. Having our own building we would
not be called on for the charges of 40 cents per
; square foot.
The heads of all departments will meet In
1 New York Monday, June 12. General Peck ad
vises me to attend, as I will get valuable in
formation, so I leave for New York to-mor
row. Will return here, reaching Chicago June
i 14, remain a day and hope to get to San Fran
j cisco by the 20th inst. I will stop off at Omaha
a few hours to secure all the pointers I can !
get from their exposition, which will soon be
opened.
Ac soon as I get a definite answer regarding
space will wire you. Should we put up our
own building In Paris It would be well to get
1 several plans from our architects on the coast,
and, after deciding on one, submit them to the
Chicago office, then they will be forwarded
to Paris for the officials there to pass on. Our
architect would go to Paris and take charge
i of the building, together with the United
! States architect, who. by the way. is In this
j country now. I will probably see him In New
' York. The commissioners here say we have
plenty of time to build, as several of the Gov
ernment, buildings have not been started yet
and will not be for a month. Yours very
truly. E. W. RUNYON.
CHICAGO. June 8. 1899.
Paris Commissionersâ Gentlemen: While on
my way East I studied the matters carefully
with regard to the exhibits California should
make, and divided them in six classes as fol
lows:
Horticulture, agriculture, . viticulture, min
ing, forestry and fisheries.
I Should we obtain our own building. It might
be well to have a woman's department with
one or two reception rooms. The above has
been referred to the ' Chicago office with their
i approval.
When you receive a wire message from me
i giving the amount of space we can have I
I think it would be well to start in with the
I work, at any rate, as much as can be done,
before you get further. particulars from me in
person.
I will answer a few questions which were
, submitted to General Peck, viz.:
The size and form of all packages will have
| to be referred to C. R. Dodge, Director of
' Agriculture, whom I shall see in New York.
As regards concessions, Mr. Blackmore, who
has charge of that department, said there
| would be none, with the exception of probably
j a restaurant and soda water fountain. I think
| we would not be much interested in these.
1 Green fruit can be given away, and the par
ties who have It in charge are now trying to
make arrangements for cold storage accommo
dations. This would give California an ad
vantage over any other State, as fruit will
probably be one of our principal exhibits.
Separate space, 7xlo, has been set aside to
make the tests of wine, which will be done by
[ tasting. As regards premiums to be award
ed, we can refer to book on general Informa
i tion.
I am quite anxious to see Mr. Scott of the
Union Iron Works in reference to Joining us
in an exhibit, provided we can get sufficient
epace in our own building. I wired Mr. Scott
to meet us in New York, but up" to the pres
! ent time have had no reply. Think probably
he has gone to the seashore for a few days.
The committee on transportation are quite
anxious that we give topographical map and
photograph of San Francisco, showing the
large docks, harbor, etc. It would be a good
advertisement for the city, and I think would
pay us to take the matter up later. Very truly
yours. E. W. RUNYON.

WANT LOCAL GRANITE
FOR NEW POSTOFFICE
ASSOCIATIONS TELEGRAPH NA
TIONAL AUTHORITIES.
Some Claim That Superintendent
Roberts Is Trying to Place the
Contracts Outside the
State.
The awarding of the contract for the
furnishing of granite for the new K.'i!i
Francisco Pustofflee hat? caused great
anxiety among local quarry owners. A
dispatch from the Kast received yesterday
announced that Assistant Secretary of tue
Treasury Taylor will probably let the
contract for Maine granite, following the
report sent the department by Superin
tendent of Construction Roberts, who i 3
imw in this city.
To prevent such selection and the boy
cotting of the California product, the fol
lowing telegram was sent yesterday to
the supervising architect of the treasury
at Washington by several of the prom
inent local trade associations. It is as
follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, June 13, 1599.
To the Supervising Architect of the
Treasury, Washington, 1). Câ The fol
lowing commercial bodies of San Fran
cisco respectfully urge that the San
Francisco Postolflce be constructed of
California granite, which is unques
tionably equal to any granite in the
world, and also on the ground that
California granite is the cheapest
under consideration. Signed:
Manufacturers' .and Producers' As
sociation of California, by A. Sbar
boro. President.
Board of Trade of San Francisco, by
A. A. "Watklns, President.
The Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco, by Charles Nelson, Presi
dent.
Superintendent Roberts is accused by
many of being too hasty in his Judgment
!of the quality of California granite. It
is said that in an investigation of the
Rocklin quarries he did nut give full time
and attention to his examination and S'-nt
i a report to the Treasury Department
! that 4000 cubic feet per week was the
utmost possible output of these quarries
; and that 7000 cubic feet was necessary.
Roberts, in a conversation with Coloni I
| .1. P. Jackson yesterday afternoon, de
: nled having made such a report. He said
; that California material would undoubt
i edly be used and not Maine granite, which
i the telegraphic report seems to assume
conclusively.

An Awful Tragedy
Occurs on Natoma
Street.
his beat on Sixth street, near Natoma,
when he heard the two shots in quick
succession and hurried to tht> scene.
By this time the narrow street was
blocked with people and the blood had
spread all over tin- sidewalk and formed
a large pool in the gutter. Mrs. Frey
was still alive but unconscious, the
bullet having i ntered just above and
Whind the right ear. She lay on the
sidewalk with her bead toward the
house, and Frey's body lay in a similar
n almost parallel and so close
that the ofllcer was compelled to move
t!ie woman before he ou!d gel the
revolver, w Inch was tightlj grasped i:i
the right hand of the murderer.
Mrs. Frey was hurried off to the
Receiving Hospital, hut died before
reaching there and her body was t;iken
to the Morgue. Frey's body presented
a ghastly and horrible sight as it lay
on the pavement awaiting the arrival
of the Morgue, wagon. Part of the
skull had been blown off and the
brains were scattered over the side
walk, while the blood completely coy
. red â¢ verything for a space of six feet.
When searched at tne Morgue a note
written on a. scrap of paper, together
with two envelopes, on which were
some Incoherent scribblings, were
found in the pockets of the murderer.
The lirst reads:
"As I â  xpei I to be forgiven for

CAUGHT A GANG OF
BOGUS MONEY-MAKERS
SECRET SERVICE AGENT WILKIE
AT THE PALACE,
Ran to Earth the Lancaster Ring of
Counterfeiters After a
Year of Clever
Sleuthing.
J. K. Wilkie of the Secret Service De
partment arrived with his wife last even
ing from "Washington. P. C. They are at
the Palace. Mr. Wilkie comes West for
a much-needed rr?t after months of the
hardest sort of labor In one. of the most
difficult cases that hns come within the
province of his department for some
years. It was due to bis efforts that the
now famous Lancaster (Pa.) ring of coun
terfeiters was captured and the Govern
ment rid of one of the cleverest and
most dangerous gang of operators that
has ever caused trouble with its currency.
In connection with the case Mr. Wilkie
said last evening: "The leaders of the
gang were William L. Jacobs and W. L.
Kendig of Lancaster, where they had es
tablished an elaborate plant for the man
ufacture of Government paper and en
graving bogus notes of high denomina
tions. They flourished for over a year,
and their work was of such a high order
that the Government's experts could not
detect the bogus from the genuine bills,
and the Treasury Department was com
pelled to call in all of the issue of $100
Monroe head silver cert ilioatesâ something
like $26.000.'*w. The engravers were Arthur
Taylor and Baldwin S. Brindley. who were
also apprehended.
"The gang also dealt in bogus revenue
stamps ami In two years sold stamps for
over 450,000,000 cigars. We also got plates
for the Jlu Sheridan head treasury not-2,
the $10 Manning silver certificate and the
$50 and %\<M Lincoln treasury notes, and
by its own confession we discovered that
the ring was just ready to issue notes for
$500 and $1000. In Its confession the gang
Implicated United States District Attor
ney Ingham and his assistant, and also
stated that the plan was to bribe the
receiving teller of the sub-treasury at
New York to receive on deposit $10,000,000
in bogus notes and issue therefor cer
tificates of deposit for a like amount."
The trial of the six conspirators begins
next week, and Mr. Wilkie will leave for
Washington this afternoon in order to be
back in time to give his evidence and as
sist in the direction of the case.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 14, 1899.
The third note was somewhat more
ambitious than the others and was as
follows:
"When the philosophy of human
family has been learned and woman
refuse to Inspire a feeling in a mascu
line heart man will think this woman's
object In life Is to play a man for a
fool and she will never leave him till
she finds a nipper fool." (
The Mrs. Wright referred to Is Mrs.
Thomns Wright, who has charge of (
little Nita, the six-year-old child of
the couple. Frey paid a visit to 128 I*.1 *.
Ninth street, where Mrs. Wright re- '
sides, Sunday afternoon, and, forcing
his way Into the â muse, grabbed the '
child and started for the door. Mrs.
Wright fought to retain possession of (
her charge, and Frey struck her
viciously on the head and chest. Mrs. '
Jennie Murphy, the landlady, went to
Mrs. Wright's assistance, and Frey '
threatened to kill them both and dash
the child's brains out. Mrs. Eva Dv- '
rg, a lodger, then took a hand
and at the same time a crowd attract- '
ed by the uproiir began hammering
for admittance, and Frey fled. i
When Mrs. Frey heard of her hus
band's attempt to gain possession of
their child she declared he would kill
them both next, and while in this
frame of mind went to the City Hall
l" get a warrant for his arrest. She ,
was unsuccessful, jowever, and the
refusal of the authorities to interfere (
In what they termed a family quarrel
resulted in last niijnt's tragedy. (
Since their separation, which was
due to Frey's gener.il unreliability as i
a provider and the fact that he spent
a goodly portion of his time in jail, i
Mrs. Frey had supported herself and
child by working in the cannery. Frey i
often visited her, but only to rail at
her and threaten. H:- was never known i
to contribute a cent to the support of
his child. His parents live at 141 StS t
Harrison street. Mrs. Frey's only
relative In ,/he city is a sister, Mrs. I
Anita Chattfield. of 10$ Sixth street.
Mrs. Frey was about 34 years old and
Frey several years older.
FEMALE PICKPOCKET
CATCHES A TARTAR
MRS. GULDAGER'S SPRINTING
BEATS A THIEF.
A San Rafael Woman Recovers Her
Purse After an Exciting Chase
Along the Water Front.
Mrs. George Galdager of San Rafael
is a natural-born sprinter. If she hadn't
been, a well-filled purse belonging to her
would now be In unworthy hands. With
a fifty-foot handicap Mrs. Guldager raced
along the water front after a female pick
pocket last evening, and not only se
Â« urea" possession of the property stolen
fr.im her, but did it without the necessity
of tHling her troubles to a policeman.
Just as Mrs. Guldagor, who is the wife,
of a popular employe of the North Pacific
Coast Kailroad Company, was leaving &
boat docking at the Sausalito ferry slip
;i. fashionably attired woman stole a purse
from the side pocket of Mrs. Guldager's
jacket and mingled with the crow i. The
victim of the theft was holding the hands
of two little children, nut released them
and started to run after the thief. Both
children began to wail and the mother
turned back. A gentleman inquired the
cause of the disturbance, and on bei-ig
tÂ«>ld volunteered to take care of the little
ones.
Leaving the children in his care Mrs
(Jul. lager ran after the woman. She
(a light sight of her on East street and i
race began for the Market-street turn
table. The pickpocket was fifty feet in the
lead, but was overhauled just as she
stepped aboard a car starting up MarKet
Btreet. Mrs. Guldager caught the woman
by the arm and demanded the return of
her purse The pickpocket pretended not

BOARD OF HEALTH
AT WAR WITH ITSELF
Members Refuse to Appoint Leon
Dennery as Secretary.
Burns Demands More Than the New Officers in Justice
to Their Reputations Can Grantâ Dr. Lawlor
Chosen Health Officer.
THERE is war in the newly elect
ed Board of Health, the mem
bers of which officially assumed
office yesterday and transacted
some important business. The public
session, which was held in the presence
of an expectant crowd, indicated noth
ing:, however, of the strife which is di
viding the members of the board and
promises to develop into a sensation.
The new officers are what is known in
political circles as "programmers."
They were appointed with the under
standing that as far as subordinate po
sitions are concerned they will obey the
will of the men that gave them their
own official stations.
It was thoroughly understood that
Governor Gape would appoint men who
would accept the dictation of Dan
Burns and deliver to him the entire
patronage of the Health Department
with which to provide for his parasites
and political favorites. Men that sup
ported the Mexican at Sacramento were
to be provided for and given places un
der the city government. The rousta
bouts, rowdies, gamblers and worse
who followed in the train of Burns were
to be taken under the protecting
shadow of the Health Board and estab
lished as pensioners of the city Treas
urer.
There was no misunderstanding in
reference to this fact, which was ac
cepted by the new members of the
Board of Health. Burns was to distrib
ute the patronage. He had legislators
to provide for, not only for favors al
ready given, but for prospective fa
vors in the event of an extra session of
the State legislature. Before the new
board whs chosen the loaves and fishes
were distributed. Dr. W. M. Lawlor,
the newly elected Health Officer, for ex
ample, was chosen months before the
personnel of the Board of Health was
even a matter of casual consideration.
Burns had promised Lawlor the place,
and Gage made the promise good.
The members of the Board of Health
understood, therefore, that they were to
receive a list of favorites and were ex
pected to appoint the men named to
the positions designated. The members
of the board knew, also, that they had
been chosen to represent and protect
certain interests, as the Southern Pa
cific Company and others. All of thes<?
conditions were accepted, and the new
board assumed office. The "pro
gramme" was presented to the board
and then war was declared.
Certain members of the board BRW
that they were asked to do something
more than provide for Dan Burns and
his political future. They saw that they
were expected to sacrifice their own
reputations to satisfy the Mexican's ob
ligations. The members of the Board
of Health were asked to appoint men
whose names are synonyms for re
proach, and whose appointment to pub
lic office would stain the characters of
the men who made the appointment.
When the members of the board saw
this fact and realized its consequence
war was declared, and certain of the
members declared tfiat they would re
sign before they would submit to the
indignity offered to them by Burns.
The clash came over the appointment
of secretary to the board. Burns de
manded that Leon Dennery be elected
to that important position. Dennery
was one of the disreputable rabble that
Burns made his train at Sacramento.
Burns wished, therefore, to provide for
him and insisted on his appointment.
This demand was a little more than
some of the members of the Board of
Health could tolerate. Rather than
submit to It they declared they would
resign their positions and retain their
decency. They said, at a private cau
cus among themselves yesterday, that
they were willing to satisfy the obliga
tions of the man who appointed them,
but they refused emphatically to sacri
fice their own reputations in doing so.
They declared that in appointing
Dennery to the important position of
secretary they would place themselves
on his level, and this they declined to
do.
When this rebellion against the
"programme" manifested itself a long
discussion ensued. At its conclusion a
compromise was suggested, but it Is
not by any means a certainty that it
will be acecpted. Some of the members
of the board urged that It would be
wise to withdraw Dennery from the
secretaryship and give him a posntion
of less prominence and importance un
der the department. There was a dis
position to accept this compromise, but
no definite action was reached before
the board met in public session.
Those members of the board that are
rebelling against the outrageous de
mands of the Mexican and who threat
en to resign if the demands are forced
upon them are supported in their fight
by officials of the Southern Pacific
Company. These officers believe that
Burns is going too far in his assertion
of power over the Governor, and in his
extravagance is making both himself
and Gage worse than useless to them.
They recommend, therefore, that Burns
be fought in the matter and be forced to
submit to the common dictates of de
cency. This phase of the affair is un
expected and promises to result in
some sensational development.
After the stormy preliminary secret
session the members of the new board
proceeded to the City Hall to accept
formally their offices. The retiring
board met shortly after 11 o'clock for
its final session. Business of a routine
character was transacted and resolu
tions in commendation of the Mer
chants' Association and the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association were
adopted. Mayor Phelan was officially
thanked for the courtesies which he
had extended to the members of the
board, and then the newly elected offi
cers were ushered to their seats.
After the reception of several com
munications Dr. Keeney moved that
the position of Health Officer be de
clared vacant. This was done and Dr.
W. M. Lawlor was elected to fill the
vacancy. The position of assistant
secretary was also declared va
cant and Peter Devany was elected
to fill the vacancy. The position of
clerk to the Health Officer followed the
same routine, and R. M. Jones, a
brother-in-law of Dr. Keeney, received
the prize. Before the board could ad
journ it was enjoined from removing
the officers and subordinates who have
brought suit to retain their positions.
The board will meet again next Mon
day, when it is expected that Dr. S. S.
Kahn will be appointed superintendent
and Dr. T. D. Maher resident physician
of the City and County Hospital, and
Dr. Heinz police surgeon. Other ap
pointments will not be discussed until
after the 23d inst., when the injunction
suit of the present employes will be
heard.
A "HEALTH" BANQUET.
Mayor Phelan Entertains the
Members of the Old and
New Boards.
Mayor Phelan last night at the Pa
cific Union Club gave a banquet to the
outgoing and incoming members of the
Board of Health. The Mayor asserts
that the function was purely compli
mentary, having no political signifi
cance.
The attendants at the feast were Dr.
J. H. Barbat, Dr. J. W. Keeney, Dr. R.
W. Payne, Dr. W. B. Coffey, Dr. J. M.
Williamson, Dr. G. J. Fitzgibbon, Dr.
R. W. Baurn, Dr. Louis Bazet, Dr. A.
P. O'Brien, Dr. W. P. Lawlor, Dr.
Washington Dodge, Dr. Perrault, Dr.
R. Beverly Cole and Hon. Frank G.
NewlandÃ. The Mayor, as the presid
ing genius of the banquet, directed the
affairs of the function. He compli
mented the retiring cnembers of the
Board of H.;ilth on the success of their
administration and expressed the be
lief that the incoming board would
make another good record.
Dr. Williamson reviewed the work of
the old board for the past four years.
He attributed the introduction of
smallpox cases to the inefficiency of the
Federal quarantine and advocated local
control of quarantine.
Frank G. Newlands spoke of the new
; spirit of San Francisco as exemplified
in the display of civic patriotism. He
regarded San Francisco, next to New
York and Washington, the most inter
esting city In the United States.
Dr. Beverly Cole entertained the com
pany with reminiscences of the first
Board of Health. The doctor, as chair
man of the hospital committee of the
! Hoard of Supervisors forty years ago,
! was himself the first Board of Health.
II" had three thousand eases of small
| pox during his term of office and got
I no thanks for his service.
Dr. Coffey spoke for the new board
and expressed the hope that its admin
j Istration would prove beneficial to the
| health and promote the prosperity of
' the city.
WILL NOT REPUDIATE
THEIR PLATFORM VOWS
DEMOCRATIC OFFICIALS FOR THE
NEW CHARTER.
All Claim Election for but One Year,
and Will Not Obstruct the New-
Instrument.
A committee recently appointed by the
Democratic County Committee for the
purpose of ascertaining from the Demo
cratic office holders of the city and county
of San Francisco their attitude toward the
new charter addressed communications to
each of the eleven successful candidates
elected by the Democrats at the last elec
tion. Thf> following is the substance of
the inquiry, which is signed by E. P. E.
Troy, chairman of the committee:
I am instructed by the committee ap
pointed at the meeting of the Demo
cratic County Committee held June 7,
1899, to write you and inquire if you
intend to abide by the Democratic
platform under which your name was
offered to the people; if you are now
contesting- or intend contesting the
validity of the new charter as affecting
the term of your office or otherwise;
or if you are aiding or intend to ni<i
in any manner any contest which may
be made against the new charter.
Mayor Phelan. City and County Attor
ney Lane, Supervisors Deasy, Lackmann
and Bylngton; School Directors Eells and
Brandenstein, Judges Mogan and Conlan
and Assessor Dodge all replied in one
strain-that they had been elected on a
platform which declared for a new char
ter: that they were in favor of it and
would countenance no contest brought to
test its validity. They further said that
at the time of their election they under
stood their terms of office to be one year
and would be willing to step from their
official seats at the end of the year 1899.
The only Democratic office holder who did
not give a clear and concise answer was
Coroner Hill. His reply Is not considered
satisfactory by the committee, and they
will apply to him ngaln.
The object of the committee in soliciting
this information Is a desire to hold all
Democratic office holders to the pledges
they took when elected and to discipline
them, as far as lies In the power of the
party, should they make any attempt to
repudiate their promises at the sacrifice
of the new charter. The communications
will be handed to the County Committee
at a meeting this evening.
SUPERVISORS HOLD
A SPECIAL SESSION
Open Fire Department Supply Bids
and Confirm the Appointment
of Fred Lees.
The Supervisors met in special session
yesterday afternoon and opened the bids
for the Fire Department supplies for the
next fiscal year. In accordance with the
usual custom the bids were referred to
the Fire Committee of the board. O. B.
Martin was appointed appraiser of the
proposed park panhandle extension to fill
the place made vacant by the resignation
of G. H. Umbsen. The appointment of
Fred W. Lees as License Collector was
confirmed.
GUERRERO-STREET MYSTERY.
The original story told by Mrs. Perry
when she went hunting a physician that
her husband slapped her in the face and
then attempted to make an angel of him
self is now denied by all the family and
the one of accidental shooting substituted
in its stead. But no explanation is given
of how the accidental shot was fired.
Perry was removed to St. Luke's Hospital
yesterday afternoon, where the house
physicians made an examination of the
wound and located the bullet lodged un
der the skin in the back directly oppo
site where it entered the left breast un
der the heart. The shock to Perry's sys
tem together with the loss of blood lias
left him very low.

SUTRO'S LINE
WILL BE SOLD
TO HUNTINGTON
Estate Cannot Stand
the Heavy Drain.
The Sutro Eleotric Railroad from Cen
tral avenue to the Cliff House is finally
to become part and parcel of the Market
street railway system. Since it was first
put in operation by Adolph Sutro as a
competitor of his old-time enemy, "the
octopus," it has been run at a loss, and
it is now merely the losing ability of the
Sutro estate that prevents the Markot
street people taking it into (.amp. Dur
ing the past few months the monthly dif
ference between receipts and expenditures
has increased so largely that it has be
come a menace to the estate, and the
trustees have opened negotiations with
the opposition with a view to getting rid
of it.
So serious did they find their position
that they have offered the entire Bystom
for less than their net loss. Pursuing it*
usual tactics the Market-street people are
waiting until bad business and increasing
losses force a still greater sacrifice. TliÂ«
details of the negotiations and the policy
of the Market-street Company are best
told in a characteristic statement made
yesterday by Henry Lynch, superintend
ent of construction of Mr. Huntington's
system.
"Tht Sutro people," said he. have been
at us two or three times to take the road
off their hands and in time we will do it,
but what's the use of buying it now?
That road has been run at a loss ever
since it was started, and always will be
as It is operated. They have offered us
the whole system for $25,000 less than they
have lost on it, and they have lost about
$150,000. They will be ready to sell for a
whole lot less than that before they are
through with it, and then will be our tirrn*
to get In.
"They know as well as we do that wj
could run it at a profit, as we coukl
amalgamate it with our system and run
power out from our main power house.
We have got enough extra men with us
all the time to run the cars. As they rim
it they need executive officers, a working
force and a power house of their own,
and there isn't the traffic on the line to
make it pay or even meet expenses. We
could operate the whole line for what
thtir coal costs them. The Sutro estate
isji't in good enough condition to stand a
drain like that fur a great length of time
and I do not think it will be long before
the operators see it that way themselves.
"It is my idea to 'put the old steam
dummy line from California street om
under electricity and run our cars out
that way and bring them back by tht"
Sutro route. Of course the Sutros have v
permanent transfer arrangement with the
Sutter-street Company, but there is noth
ing in the way of our assuming that con
tract when the time comes, and that is
what we shall probably do."
Asked if he could say when the transfer
would be made. Mr. Lynch said he coul'l
not, but from every indication it would
not be longâ it was simply a question of
how long the estate could stand the iitvs-
Bure. When it finally succumbs Mr.
Lynch will be on hand to listen to a
further proposal of reduction in price and
close the d^al.
