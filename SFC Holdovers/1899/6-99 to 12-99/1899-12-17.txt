THE SUNDAY CALLDcccmDcr 17m, 1599.THE FAMOUS KITCHELL COMPOSITE MADONNA
/I CAREFUL study of the famous beauty types of
yj^ the Madonna, ha ng in view the object to concen-
trate or generalise into as fcxu as possible those mas
terpieces comprehensively portraying the different motives of
the different school exponents through the centuries of </'
vicnt. sugi Mr. Kitciicll the idea of one grand en rrm
ble, a composite blend of all these attainments in idealism.
\raphy assists alike the scientist and the artist, and
it was the only km >ncy whereby the work of many hun
dred artists might be truthfully summarized in the represent
ative total unit-zrtht Composite Madonna being the result.
The practicability of the scheme was beyond dispute, and
could be likened in some particulars to many and mere famil
iar propositions in mathematics, hit in photography the
Osition is expressed in lines and proportions as unerring as the
laws of light.
A few words,mighi be of interest regarding the pn
by which the composite :^as reproduced. Its attainment is
now recognised as the chicftest triumph in modern photogra
phy, and was made possible by the use of perfected lenses of
Jena glass, special orlhochrotnitised plates, and a simple but
ingenious apparatus for correct juxtaposition in exposure by
which the orbital, nasal and labial lines were placed in correct
) V/\
The system adopted was that by which generally similar
paintings were placed '" a separate class, each picture m a
class 7ras photographed successively on a plate that became the
composite negative of its class, cc lass was similarly photo*
THE srNT>AY CALL.
gr_aphcd, and prints from each negative thus obtained afforded
the material for the final composite negative, from which the
"Kitchell Composite Madonna' w a direct print.
Thi result is indeed marvelous, at r a blend of so
lyany faces it is remarkably distinct, yet it is strangely mys
terious and spiritual, a face different to any ever seen, difficult
to describe or analyze, one marvels to compare it with any
of the separate units that compose it.
iull of calm repose, maidenly but with the dignity of
maternity, </ face indescribably sweet, resignedly sad, a -wm
drous blend of simplicity and inspired wisdom, the eyes look
out with modesty but fearlessness. If one contemplates ivith
eyes of faith it ca th devotion, for there is man's high
est conception of the Mother of God; even if believing not,
there is seen the loftiest /'(/(â¢<â¢/ possible in the heart and] mind
of mankind â the universal type of motherhood â the trans
cendent beauty of Mother L< ue.
Joseph Gray Kitchell, aged 33 years, is a native of Oliio,
but lived for ten years in Nezv York. For the last two
he has conducted a high-class residence studio for photo port
traiture in Indianapolis, similar to those operated by James
L. Breese in New, York and Steffins in Chicago. Mr. Kitchell
comes from a family of artists, an uncle having been awarded
the Cross of the Legion of Honor in France for painting.
He is also a cousin of Mine. Julie Rh'i King, the famous
pianiste. He spent the winter three years ago at Bella Vista

A STORY OF THE LEAGUE

The cry came from the slouch,
from beyond the clump of green wil

QuÂ« quiere? One must he amused some
way In a dull little town.
One morning there was blowing of
trumpet and clatter of horses and hurry-
Ing Â«if mÂ«-n across thi- plaza and through
the quiet street, and in a few hours the
troops were off. To the west, across the
range, the Indians had left their reserva
tion and were gathering In no peaceful
way. So all available help had been sum
moned.
There had been â¢ hurried leave-taking
at the cottage gate, but no "adios" was
spokenâ only the hopeful "hasta ma
nana," that word which, wanting to our
cold tongue, conceals the anguish of
many a parting.
From the porch, where they had sat so
often together in the warm summer twi
light, l'epita watched the line of men
march down from the barracks on the
hillside, with beating drums and flying
colors; watched them pass out of the
village and mount the Tuft â¢â  Canyon
trail, nnd as they disappeared behind th*
mountain she drew off the white scarf
which she wore on her head and waved
It aloft and saw. like a flake of snow, a
tiny white speck gleam for an Instant,
against the mountain top and then dls
nppear. Then she turned and* went into
the cottage.
That had been but a few months ago,
and yet how long i: seemed! From time
to time some news of the troops had
found its way Into the village. It had
beÂ»-!i rumored that the Indians were quiet
again and were returning to their reser
vation. They said. too. that the men
mi^ht be sent to Mexico.
Of all this Peplta was thinking a.Â« she
walked undrr the clear, starry skies this
Christmas eve. Of late phe. hail seldom
pone to church, for somehow she could
not pray as she used, and try as ehÂ«
would i feeling of c :iit and sham*
always crept over her. Like thÂ«
publican of old. she had faJ^
ten Into th* way oX
taking the- last place
In God's house,
and If she did
n<M. as he
did, cry out.
"O Lor d.
have mercy
on m* a slnÂ»
ncr!" Â».e
unformed
words
were
In her
heart, an&
If was al
ways a relief
when th*' service was over ana she
could steal quietly out of her corner be
fore the others had left their places.
And yet, could th. past few months be
recalled, would she act differently? In
spite of the warning voice within, would
she even now give up her lover? At the
qiu-stion. a tall, uniformed figure would
stand by her side and a pair of bright
blue eyes look into hers, and no answer
would come to her heart, no response to
her lips; but she would crouch further
still Into her corner and for some min
utes not raise her head to look toward
the altar.
Out from the church, borne on the still
ni>:ht air, came the old Christmas hymn,
sung in every land this holy eight:

The Cat Who Would Be King.
THF.RK was a cat who kept a smre Mire, milk and catnip <liÂ«l hr <corn. But I<>! he smote that spurious king
With other cats for customers. And wont to business less and less â And stripped him oi his tinsel crown,
He kept his mice And everywhere Then like the wind
All in iceâ He wore an air Full close behind
Hit catnip all in canisters. Of arrogance and haughtiness. He chased His Highness into town
Fresh milk he furnished every day â¢
Two times a day and sometimes three -
And so this cat
Grew ri'-h and fat
And proud as any cat could be.
But though M fat and rich he grew
He was not satisfied at al! â
At laÂ«t quoth he,
"A king I'll be
Of other cats t><Â«th great and small."
Then hied he to the tinner cat
Who trade for him a proper crown,
And on the street
A king complete
He soon went marching up and dowu.
Now many cat* came out to <;ee.
And some were tilled with awe at him;
While some, alack!
Behind his back
Did laugh and point a paw at him.

then, over It all, softening every defect,

nuts and berrl- o.
Now Phe was a thing apartâ amons;
them, but not of t^em. Their ways had
parted, and It was she who had gone aside
from their quiet pathway.
Far up In the church were an uncle anÂ«l
aunt and their family, her nearest living
relatives. Peplta gazed long at t> â¢
young cousins r>f about her own age.
How pure and holy they looked, kneeling
there In their white gowns and -
with folded hands and downcast eyes)
Soon the sanctuary door opened and the.
priest came out. vested In his robes. The
choir Intoned the "Kyrie" and mass be
gan. It was a i.lKh mass, with lonjc
ornamentations, many responses
and much swlhKlns of Incensor;
yet for Pcplta It passed quick
ly, and It did not seem Ion?
to her before Padre Anto
nio had approached the
crib, and lifting from Its
bed of straw the wax
en fljcure of the. In
fant, bore It In his
arms to the sanc
tuary {rates,
.which had been
thrown open.
There was a
Mir In thÂ«
church,
and
then, on* by onÂ». th* people rose from
their places to go up to the rail to re
ceive the Christmas kiss from the lips of
the "Ninlto Dlos." With this quaint old
Spanish ceremony, brought bjf her ances
tnrs from the mother country and still
observed wherever Its sons are to ba
found, were associated for Peplta many
pleasant recollections. As a child she had
always Imagined that when she had been
Rood the baby feature! of the. Infant had
smiled down upon her. as she. stood on
tip-toe to. kiss It. but that when she had
been naughty they wore a frown and a
look of reproach meant solely for her.
She had always taken advantage of the
former occasions to whisper to him what
she wanted him to bring her. while on
the latter she would not even have the
courage to promise to be hotter, although
she truly meant to be. To the* Ninlto also
she had confided her griff nt her mother*
death. That Christmas eve. standing on
the tips of her small feel so t ns to quite
reach his ear, she had whispered. "BÂ«
very good to 'mamma In heaven, Uttl*
Jesus."
Now la Padre Antonio stood at the altar
rail, his white hair looking whiter than
ever, his head bent over the Image In hiÂ»
arms. Just as he had stood for ho many
years. Peplta laid her hrad upon the back
of the pew In front of her, ami had not
all been so Intent waiting for th^lr turn
or returning to th. â¢ places, they might
have heard something which sounded like
a soli issuing from that dark angle near
the door. Old men and young, matrons
and maidens and children, all went upâ
til except Pepita; for her alone no kiss
from the Christ child this holy night. No;
she might come to church, but never,
never would she be hypocrite enough to
touch the lips of the "Nlnito IÂ»los." anit
from her heart at that moment rose a
prayer for help and strength nnd guid
anceâ a prayer of anguish, such as the
â¢oul utters only In the hour of Its darkest
agony; a cry that Is ne\er sent forth In
vain, but which, traversing the Infinite,
reaches the supreme center of all lovÂ©
and strength and consolation.
The Infant had been replaced In the
manger and there remained only the few
words of greeting which Padre Anton'.o
always spoke to his children before they
returned to their homes after midnight
mass. He rind been with them â¢< â > lone
and they loved him so well, this kindly
old Franciscan, that Christmas won not
hays seemed Christmas without his
wishes.
It wan Sunday as well that day; so the
parish announcements came first. Peplta
scarcely realized that the. padre had be
gun to speak.
"There Is a promise < ' marriage he.
tween Ferdinand Boynton. first lieutenant
of Company D, of the Kegiment.
lately quartered In this town and Maria
Teresa Franclsca Perez of the city of
Mexico. Any one knowing any impedi
ments to this marriage, of which this Is
the first and last announcement. -'â¢. r.'.i
make it known now or forever more b-Â»
silent."
The choir was hushed, the last note of
the organ had died away Into silence, one
by one the light* had bern extinguished,
all except the sanctuary lamp nnd a f*>e.
ble glimmer before the crib, and only the
grayish purple Incense curling and rl.Â«lnj;
toward the celling, then breaking and
floating away In great clouds, told of
what had been.
AT. had left the church and wÂ»'re mak-
Ing their way homeward, lighted by the
shining of the Christmas stars. Th*
great key hid tu.r.ed In the !<>rk. a re
treating footstep was heard on the gravel
outside and the all-seeing present* alnna
kept watch In the house that was his 1 .
Bui no. in the nickering, uncertain
gleam, a figure might have ho*n seen to
detach Itself from the deep shadows
around itâ a slim, slight figure; so still
and motionless wns thÂ« posture, so whir*
and calm the fare beneath the black
Fcarf. so fixen the look In thÂ» great dirk
eyes, that for all tin resemblance it bore
to life the whole might have been chiseled
in mat hie.
The light flickered and rose and grew
dim. the waxen figure In the crib
stretched out Its tiny arms to the world
as If to Invite It to Itsoif.
In the early gray d.iwn of Chrlstma*
morning Padre Antonio came Into the
church, and after kneeling a moment be
fore the high altar, crossed over to Â« her*
the single feeble flicker of taper burned
before th.> manger.
Suddenly he started bark, for knÂ«>ellr.c
before the crib, bending down over if. her
firms encircling the Infant and her ltp<t
pressed against his. was Â« young girl.
Astonished nt her presence and tier atti
tude, the priest touched her gently on the
shoulder, once, twice, then laid his hand
upon herÂ«Â«. hut withdrew It with a shud
der, for the slim hand was co.d with an
iceness which he knew too well.

mas kiss of the "Ninlto Dios. 1 *

HÂ« Immediately went abroad a*a!n to
devote hlm*elf to his art. for he was a
ir.orvelous violinist. After a year or two
he returned to America with his wife, a
dainty young Frerlch clrl. In the early
â¢ iiTTimer their child was born, and for a
*hort timÂ«Â» no shadow hovered over the
Kqunre white house. Hut on Christmas
eve whllÂ« the people â .â â â â¢ gathered In
the' streets waltlr.R for the bellt< to rlnjf
In lbÂ« Joyous day. suddenly shrieks and
moans and pobs were heard cominp from
Uic Ucldcn house, At first people thought
KATHRYN JARBOE
It was hut the violin, for they know that
a violin can e>>b and mmm and scream
with human misery and dos-rpair. But at
lust the truth was recognized; it was. in
deed, a woman's voice, inspired by what
emotion no one could tell. Then, in a few
moments, the wide door was Hung open
ami Mrs. BeloVn. with whito. haggard
f:Â»c ( -Â» and tcur-drnwned eyes, rushed down
rho step*. She clasped her chiM close In
her arm*, and without pause or backward
glance, disappeared down the dnrk street.
The curious mob were met at the
threshold of the doi>r by the. owner of tho
house. The light foil on his wavy brown
hair and <>n his sot, stern face; for only
nu instant. though: then the door was
closed Rcntly. but firmly, and from that
tiltlit Edwin UÂ«'lden never spoke to any
human bolnp, never was seen by any one.
The gradual demy of the house itself
wns evident to every chance passer-by.
The boarded windows excited curiosity
that could not be gratified. When the
possi rs were asked why they never ppoke
to thÂ« white-haired flsrurÂ© rh It hurried
rast they phrucge.i their Rhouldern and
crossed themselves; It might bÂ« Edwin
IJeMfn. It miKht not, who knows? And
yet in this the goulps "were foolish. for
they knew that the dally bread of life
â M left on the doorstep each mnrnlnir,
that It lay there until night, and the next
mornlnp it was pone.
Bui PtronÃer hearts than tIM M Italian
fisher folk can boast of would have
shrunk fmm the sounds that sometimes
woke the stillness of the old house. Only
a violin? fan a violin moan and sob and
then burst forth Into passionate shrieks,
then sink ln:o low, hurried, almost hu
man pleading, only, to rise again into
shrieks and screams?
These erewsome sounds were not often
h*ard. only at Intervals of weeks or
months. But on every Christmas eve the
echoes of the old house rang with melody,
wondrous, Â»weÂ« and beautiful. For
twenty years the people of the quarter
had congregated under the shadow of
the church, but near enough to the house
to hear the marvelous notes.
Then came a Christmas eve, dark and
stormy. The rain poured from the clouds
and the wind rushed madly up the street,
tearing branches from the trees, rattling
windows and banging doors. The sway-
Ing eucalyptus trees, shivered and shook,
whispering their oft-told tales. The peo
ple huddled before their fires, drew their
Fhoulders closer together and sighed. No
1>p11iÂ», to-night, no unearthly music, no
merry Interchange of Christmas wishes
ar.d Christmas hopes. Suddenly the storm
broke and the wind died down, the rain
stopped and the people rushed to the
tryst Ing place.
The moon wns full and the shadow of
St. Mary's cross fell on the weather-beat
en gabled roof of Edwin ten's house,
reclamations of awe and wonder broke
from the crowd. Then a sllmee fell on
the waiting groups. Higher and clearer
rose the exquisite melody that thrilled
their hearts with* Joy, for melody has a
stronger hold on these Southern souli
than even fear Itself. Suddenly with a
crash of discord the sounds ceased.
Inside the house Edwin Belden sat be
fore his empty fireplace. His long white
hair and beard gave a weird, uncanny
look to the still youthful face with Its
vigorous, flashing eyes and firm, quiet
mouth Assuredly for him the old house
was haunted: haunted by the ghosts be
fore which strong men shrink, the ghosts
of memory. The tragedy of his name and
race was heavy upon him. The curse that
had seemingly settled upon them so many
years before weighed him down. The only
polace ho allowed himself was his violin,
and on this night of all nights In the year
he tried to drown all thoughts, all sounds,
even memory Itself In a flood of melody.
But to-night the sounds had been more
Impossible to mas'or. The air of the old
house seemed to thrill with llfe.hls nerves
wore tinpllnj; with â  new sensation, as of
some fellow creature near at hand. And
yet he knew j.ow Impossible It was. how
utterly alone within those four grim walls
he was. He turned to his violin once
more. But Instead of the vibrant tones he
had before called Into life, he played a
soft melody, i cradle song. It was the
rippling French lullaby his wife had sung
to her child. From somewhere, from the
walls, no doubt, he heard me old tune.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
and softly, faintly, he followed It with
his violin. Suddenly he flung the Instru
ment from him. "God In heaven:" he
cried. "I am going mad. How long must
this last?"
In the room below stood Edwin Belden's
child, a woman of twenty years, with her
own baby clasped In her arras. On that
Christmas night, twenty years before, taÂ»
younp wife had fled from her huKhnnd's
house In a momentary burst of childish

She rushed across the ocean to her Klrl

Her child waa brought up by relatives.
She married an American and. returning

A look of adoration flashed Into h!Â« -lirk
brown eyes, but It was followed Instantly
by one of abject terror.
"Madeline, my Madeline," he grasped.

small, gray rmcient place, with gigantic
walla and marble ruins and tenth-century
houses, clustered round a Longobardo

living as one of the family and attaching
herself to them with Hi" affection of a
ring. They were the people who hail ever
been good to her. Her mist res.*. Â«\iterin;i
I<orrn2<"iti. always called Madama Tina
by her neighbors nnd servants, was a
widow with three v.ii;i:c s'iti--. who had
means enough to live with a certain e.tse.

Nerina loved the merry, good-natured,
handsome lads, but she ndored their
mother, who had never said a harsh word

Her patience did nÂ«.t fall her In her task
nnd Kerina became a Grateful and cap
able servant: never very peaceable, quiet
Â«>r accomplished, but unremitting in ef
fort, devoted In sickness, useful in all
homely, hardy ways, and tilled with a
passion of loyalty and love for Madama
Tina and the thr*-e bright boys who had

their handsome faces and who, if they
sometimes plagued hor. loved her warm

pails from the well on the rampart: sh.j
went for the milk and did all the mar
keting: she mad-? the bread and cooked
the polenta; she scrubbed and swept and
scoured all the coppers and all the stair*
and floors: she went to mass at 5 o'clock
in the morning In all weathers; she
washed all the linen in the river which
ran beneath the city wall; and In her
few leisure hours spun and sewed for the
family and herself. It was a hard life,
but she was content In it and even en
joyed every hour in it with the vigor of
a sane and robust temperament, a
healthy constitution and a grateful soul.
It was so much to her to sleep soundly
without fear of the brute kicking her oft
the bed of leaves on to the ground; nnd
to hear the placid voice of her mistress
and the gay sours of the children, In
st.ad of the curses of the herdsmen an.l
the lewd jokes of the shepherds In drink.
She would have asked nothing more of
the saints than to let this life po on for
over. â¢'Only let me be worthier." she said
In her prayers every time that she knelt
down in the little dusky aisle where she
went for conf.ssion in the I.ongobardo
church. In this town, perched so high,
nt a greater altitude than even the rocks
of the Sagro Speco. the winters are ex
ceedingly cold and the summers
cruelly hot; in midsummer 'he stones
burn the feet which tread them, and In
winter the icicles hang from the fountains
and water spouts, and the winds moan
round the battlemented walls, as thÂ« mer
cenaries of Rorgla and Farnese. Orslnl
and Barberini. were wont to ride beneath
them in days of siege when all the coun
try beneath was burning In the inter
necine wars of the pontiffs and princes.
But Nerina was a strong mountain-born
woman who did not heed such email
things as heat nnd cold, and she ramÂ«
and went, up and down the steep streets,
like a gust of wind herself. Se%-eral offers
of marriage were mad* her by men of the
town, by men of the hills above, and men
of the plains below; but she would have
none of â¢ â¢ m.
"Never more a master for me." she said
to her mistress. "I am out of the net of
the fowler; never more will I pet In If

And thl? plain, peaceful tenor of her
days might have gone on until death
Should have taken her. but for the rest

The beautiful tall boys grew up and
went away, one by one. The eldest, who
was a priest, was sent by his church to
Brazil; the second, perforce, became a
soldier, and was In Africa; the third went
to study painting In Venice. The young
artist came back at Intervals, but rarely;

The one who had gone to study art was
the ycui gest . by name Romanlno, â  lad
of twenty. with a face like the Plttl
Ganymede's, and a temperament tender.
Impulsive, heroic, full of dreams. Ills
mother had heavy anxieties about him
which she could not confide to the un
learned hraln of her woman. Yet Nerlna
vaguely understood the dreams which had
Eer.t Romanino. their darling. Into danger.
"Per Romanina wants to make the
world anew." she said; "and it's too bad.
and too old. and too cruel: he will only
break his heart on It. as the poor mules
break theirs climbing up over the stones
Of these steep streets."
She understood only a little, vaguely;
but something she understood: R imanino
had talked to her so much, leaning his
curly head against her knees and indif
ferent to the capacity of his auditor In
the ardor of his own eloquence. "He
wants to have nobody hungry, or cold, or
shoeless any more." she laid to her mis
tress. "Dear, sweet soul! He might as
well wish the stones of the ramparts to
turn Into wheaten loaves. There are the
gorged pigs on one side of the world and
the famished dogs on the other; and there
always have been and there always will
be. Tell him so. mndama."

live natures fidelity dors not hesitate at
evil; If evil can spare any injury to the
one beloved, It becomes no longer an evil,
but a duty, a virtue, a heroism. Nerlna
could not have reasoned about it. but it
was thus that she felt. To screen her
lady from calamity, there was no crime
which would not have seemed sanctified
to her.
One winter these uncanny atoms of
written paper, which had such magical
power (she saw) to wound and to delight
seemed to cause continual anxiety to her
.mistress; especially those which came
Jfrom Itomanlno. "lie is vexing his soul

In the spring which followed that win
ter, the "Maladetta primavera"' of lag,
there was great trouble in the country.
There were riots in many provinces, and
hungry crowds pillaged and burnt, and
the roar of cannon "woke the echoes of
many a street in many a town, and terror
ellen<-Â°d thÂ»Â» moans of a tortured people.
In the little city of Iftadama Tina all was
quiet The echoes of the cannonades and
the shrieks of the wounded did not reach
this high crest 'of the rock, and tho
church bells rung as peacefully as ever,
and the daffodils blossomed ak is the
rlv?r banks, and the sun set and row and
the moolipht shone on the red-cray moss
â¢rrown roofs; and only Madam. i Tina
knew the terrible disquiet and desperation
â which there were elsewhere. The letters
told wicked, white owlets of woe. aa
they appeared to be to her woman.

resistible need of some one to share her
torture of anxiety she told Kerina all she
feared, one day, when the letter-e.irrler
passed down the ct^rp street and did not
stopâ the seventh time he had not stopped.
She was anxious for all; for the eldest-ln

but most of all for the youngi st, the beau

on thÂ» harsh reality of brutal facts, and*

THE SUNDAY CALL.
Weird and faint and dreary,
Like echoes of the long ago.
On the afternoon of that morning which
told us of the Bronkhorst Spruit tragedy
an event occurred which Is almost unique
In the records of British colonization.
It was a message not from the patron
saint of that festive season, a message not
of "peace on earth." but a proclamation
by the Colonial Secretary (her Britannic
Majesty's representative In the Trans
vaal) announcing martial law.
'IT' Instrument was read to the popu
lace In the market i ;unr<>, where stands
Oom Paul's church, and Its old rafters
must have reluctantly echoed the triple
cheer which accepted this drastic but
unavoidable measure.
All citizens, after being granted three
hours' option to remain with the garrison
or retire to th^ Boer lines, were subject
to military discipline; all foodstuffs were
turned in to hi quartermaster general
and all ration;' were Issued In accordance
with commissariat schedule. The city
was evacuated, homes and stores barri
caded, while thÂ» population took itsHf
t:> the laager <Â«>r camp). There. In stables,
nuthouses, tents, huts or open-air suites,
free from "rint and taxes." all found a
home. The military, regular and volun
teer, took upon themselves tho more seri
ous responsibility of "holding the fort."
ThÂ«Â» last mnllcart had arrived, the post
odlce closed, and thus not a chance avail
nblc to ruail Christmas cards. Even a
"wire" to home was impossible, as the
Boers had torn up some ninety miles of
telegraph) Thus we were shut off from the
outer world, isolated absolutely and en
tirely!] and surrounded by a wily and able
foci whose tender mercies we had already
recognized In the v. Inte flag decoy at
Bronkhorct Spruit.
The early days of camp life were occu
pier! by erecting defense*, earthworks and
barricades, making saps and placing dy
namite mines. The nlghtd found us In
th*Â» saddle, either a.Â« videttes or patrols,
some miles outside of the camp. Day and
night wp were on the alert, while half an
hour's sleep on an Ironstone bowlder or
a "feather-bed," a bare ten-inch plank,
was a luxury hardly attainable but much
sought afte". On Christmas eve a dls-
Vatrh rider came Into enmp from Mont
I In. some miles tn the southeast, on
the HH'lelberg roail i\e> Informed ttl 'lit:
the Boere were In force at that place and
that they had arranged to march upon
Pretoria. He brought a meftsage from
the Boer commandant to our chief of
staff to the effect thnt h^ demanded tho
surrender of Pretoria within ten hours.
This was our Christmas card, arrived al
the eleventh hour, and as such It was
entitled to a courteous reply, the ro^uo<Â«t
being so civil and modest Accordingly.
M the "iiost Rreeiinn.* of the season" we
Intimated to mynheer thai we had plum

"Boer-head." I prefixed a postscript that
If mynheer the commandant, on receipt
of our reply, felt depressed we could ac
commodate him with some dynamite to
raise him up. and If hip real was broken
he could have a few shrapnel to put him
to sleep.
The rider again repeated his warning,
but as ha had our reply no further delay
was necessary, and this the last voice
from the outside world (as It proved to be
for 103 days) departed exclaiming:
Ik beb ffenoeff, '1*Â» Â«om N on.lf>r Ik he 6

âthe sun has set. I have told you: good

connection with our story that the sea

the reverse of those In our latitude. Thus

season, a period of the year not desirable
for outside operations, as the streams he

fall. Tlu- veldt, however, Is covered with
abundant trass, which rapidly puts into
condition all kinds of stock. The present

the Boers not so much from ultimatum
adjusting, but from the fact that the rain

To that storm we probably owe the non
fulfillment of the Hoera" promise "to

Gradually li*Â» rain clouds drifted away
to the northwest before the advent of
the dawn, whose rostuto hues tinged with
brilliancy the eustern sides Jusi as they
had done centuries ago and proclaimed to
the "watchers" Christmas day. Wet to
the skin, hungry and wearied, we de
scended the kopje and a, mutual embrace
all around was our greeting "In arm*." as
evidence If not of "peace on earth" at
least of a comrade's good will. We fell
back upon camp, received a cup of cof
fet. me stale hardtack (gray with age
and hoary with antiquity), a bundle of
forage and an hour's leave to sleep, "all
standing"â that la, ammunition, boots
and spurs. These were all the gifts our
stocking could materialize that memora
ble Christmas morning, owing, as It was
explained, to the fact that Santa Claus
could not find any chimney In our sentry
box.
A more sorry spectacle than that pre-
Rented by the camp that morning would
be difficult to conceive. It was the most
realistic travesty upon the season of
mirth, song and good cheer. It forcibly

6lcmly emerge forÂ» bedraggled mother
hung on to by a lot of .shivering, half
clad, terrified children. Cooking was out
of the question; misery, discomfort and
vexation had captured the camp. Tiy
noon thÂ« hot sun had worked a reforma
tion; the floods subsided and the tears of
the morning were forgotten by the ladles,
who later on looked real smart as they
turned out In alepe costumes to adorn
the "concert" given by the military in the
raxrlson redoubt, where the pipers, flfrs
and drums rendered a selection of sacred
and popular melodies
After the concert, the ladles were es
corted around the camp, many of them
seeing for the first time our defenses of
planks, sandbags and earthworks, with
here and there an embrasure through
which pointed the muzzle of a i or 12
pound gun. whlrh looked very benign in
the decorations of evergreens which the
gunners. In honor of the day and of the
event, had turned among the timbers.
Each muzzle was further adorned by a
large bunch of wild MS, gathered from
the hedgf3 which surrounded the city,
now lying lonely and deserted within
striking distance of these Its grim pro
tectors. Up on the kopjes commanding
the southern road of advance lay our out
look forts or blockhouse*. The stony
pathway leading thither was further
hampered by wire and thorn entangle
ments, so that our guests declined to
carry the position and decided to cap
ture it from a distance.

"Lights out" followed by a dlrgellk*
wail o' the pipes In their pathetic rendi

with its unique memorlea became an event
In history.
In the cray dawn of the following day
signal shots from the vfdettes woke thÂ»

Twenty-five per cent of the carbineer*

had to assume the defense of the most
exposed flank In the variOQl engagements.
Feeling the enemy's position, as It Is

â¢poke the feelings nnuttered by their
silent, uncomplaining lips. Then the wall

Onâ !-Â«â  Niifhe PuenA at our hactt-ndir
there were always many families besides
our own. My uncle. Plo Pico, was twice
the Governor of California, and my father
was one of the Justices who correspond
to opt Chief Justice of the SuDrem* Court
Â«-Ju(sge of the Court of the Primer* livÂ»
â tanciaâ and being: so much la public life
had no lack of company.
AH came on horseback, as there were
neither carriages nor roads, and the fact
of all traveling that way added to the
pleasure and romance of the .occasion, for
women never look better than when
mounted on a favorite pony, that know*
how to show off both Itself and them, and
men never npp<ar more active, brave
looking or well at ease than as cavaliers.
Our house, like most of the larger, was
In the. form of a hollow square, with the
rooms mainly opening on 1 Inner veranda*.
Each room had It* own adobe fireplace,
usually built In the corner, and many of
them had all housekeeping conveniences,
which were then simple,* as stoves were
not In use, all cooking being done over
the open fireplace. Ho many of our vis
itors made themselves at home In the
fullest sense of the term, bringing their
own servants and merely drawing provi
clons from the ample supplies In the
storerooms. In that way our guests,
though numerous, caused little Incon
venience or disturbance of our way of
life and we had plenty of time to amuse
ourselves. ,
One Christmas eve, I remember best,
there was a full moon. Over all the
ground there was a glittering frost, Just
enough to whiten everything, yet not
enough to even rip the orange trees,
which at this Reason of the year hang full
of frutt and mossbm both. Though crisp
and cold outsldo the patio It waÂ» warm
within by reason of the shelter and of the
fires In the rooms opening on It and of thÂ»
numerous lanterns which, hung all about
the verandat * - â¢~ " -v
TVÂ« had much musicâ guitars of thÂ«
Mexican and. Spanish typÂ«. made with
twelve strings of wire, and mandolin!*.
After supper there was dancing in the
patio. coffee and cigarltos on the veran
das, and Hinging everywhere. Some one
said It would Lie a beautiful night for a
horseback ride over the valley to the
Mltslon Santa Clara.
The horses In the corral wore soon sad
dled. There were twenty-five or thirty of
us young men and women. Our horses
were the best of the big herds that were
attached to every rancho, and as an In
stance of th* number we kept I remem
ber that In the year 1*34 we had to kill 700
horses at a place near San JosÂ© which we
called LrfS Lagunltas. on account of the
dry season and the shortness of grass.
The saddles, bridles and spurs were heav
ily covered with sliver bullion ornaments,
as In those times we put our sliver on our
horses instead of on our dining tables;
for Spaniards, you know,' live on horse
back, and they eat but to live. Instead of
living to eat. â â "/;â¢â 'â 
Riding out of the patio gate It was like
a scene from the time of the Moora in
Spain. As our horses snorted In the cold
air they spun the rollers in their bits,
making musio that only the Spanish
horseman knows, for the eager horse,
ready for a dash, tells by his brisk
tattling of the cog In his bit how spirited

Our course led through the' beautiful ala
meda, where the moonlight streamed
through the branches that laced overhead
and continued In perspective to the van.
ishing point.
Coming to the Mission Santa Clara,
there was a ruddy light as of a burning
building, that turned out to be the Indian
encampment, holding one of their ceremo
nious dances which always precedes busi
ness, pleasure or war. We always saw to
it that the Indians had plenty to rat. for
there was no easier way to keep them In
subjection than by making: presents . of
food, and. at Christmas time we had the
better reason of wishing to show thÂ« the
substantial benefits of Christianity.
At all of the fires were Indians cooking
and eating. After they had eaten for -a
time they began to steal away and hide In
the darkness, except a few of the oldest
men and women, who stayed to replenish
the tiro. Suddenly loud yells spilt the air.
and from behind trees, on the flat and
rocks on the hill Indians came running in
as though to murder and scalp those
about the fire. Then from the other side
came the war cry, and other Indians
rushed to defend the elders. After that
thcro was a sort of sham battle, all
laughing, wrestling and rolling on the
ground till tired and ready to eat again.
Then El Capitan -stood trp by- â¢ the Dior
the squaws. Mahalas and papooses seated
themselves close about, the men arranged
themselves In a large circle all facing di
rectly away from the center. El Capitan
said something In the Indian language
and each of the men walked straight
away as his face tt.i.Â«i pointed ann RRrnt
as thÂ« grave. In this way they radiated
to evory degree of the compass nn<l going
out for some distance scouted the country
about, then In a few minutes all n-turnfd
to the places from which they had de
parted and stood motionless and mute.
The chief then called upon one of them
for a report as to whether he hnd reÂ»Â»n
any enemies. The man addressed an
swered In the negative, the on. next him
Immediately followed and so it ran around
the circle, until all had reported no tfnnprr.
Then began the dance. Several Indians
drummed with sticks oh dry hldÂ«Â»s and
the circle commenced to move slowly and
softly aroimd. lifting their feet .very hlph
and bending their heads as though look
ing and listening 1 . Then, from a member
of the silent circle came a ft 1 as though
the trail of an inferior enemy had been
seen. The drumming started lor.d and
fast, the Indians began to run rapidly,
waving their handkerchiefs and finally
their blankets.- More wood wns^pllcd on
the flro and at the *na the Indians were
running round, at full speed yelling and
striking at the ones in front of them and
driving them into fury while El Capltan
in the center urged them to more exer
tion.
All came to a â uddca Â«top. ravened
Â«JÂ«lr direction and commenced flanclas; \f
â¢tepplng very high with one foot, horptag
twice on the other and alternating to a
way to express great glee a* at thÂ« â¢oo
cessful termination of an episode. When
the Indians were, through with thÂ«fr play
the padres came slowly from the Mission,
the Indians formed In line after them and
march.-d away to the night man, to llaten
to the simple- story of the child la thÂ«
manger and to gaze upon the Old TWta
ment scenes shown In picture* oa thÂ«
walla, where devils In hades "Mil loot
â¢ouls Into brimstone lakes.
So the allegory of the evening ibovad
how the Indians had thought only eÂ£
war, how they had sought for their Â«ne
mlcs and pursued them, and bow at lvi
they had come Into the church.
One of the old Indians left try the ttr%
came up to us and, holding oat his mA ,
iald, "Tabac?"
I gave him a generous pinch fresa mr
wallet, which he stowed In some tnrlxlb!Â«
pocket and Immediately held out his hand
again. Taking this for a hint that he had
not had enough I gave him another hand
ful, which he caused to disappear aÂ« be
fore. Having thus whetted his cupidity
by apparently endless giving, I wanted to
make him give me nomethlng In return.
and. knowing that there were strange In
diana In the hills to the west.' I asked him
If we couM find a camp of them. All he
did was to hold out his hand and say
"Tabac!"
"No; no tabac. Q'ieÂ«ta> lea IndloeT*
"Qulen Babe? Tabac?"
"No; no tabac till you tall me where
Indians."
"Over there. Two hills. Reap Indian.
Chlnlgchlnlch come tc-nlghL Tabao?

I gave all In my pouch, which he took
without thanks and held out his hand
again.
Out In the western hill!* were some In
dians who had not been converted en
tirely and Ft 111 kept up their wild abo
riginal dances. They had bÂ«*en fir some
time trying to get our Puebin Indians to
come and Join them, anrl this present
dance which they wrro having was In
tended as an opposition to the Chrtstmaa
festival and -was to b# such a b1Â» dane*

I do not remember my first lie. It is too

very well. I was nine days old at the

coddled and pitied in a most asiveablo

done It. During the first half of my life
I never knew a child that was able to

kr.ow. In th* magnitude of Its territorial
rprrad It Is one of the most majr*tlc lies
that the civilisations make It thrlr sacred
and anxl3UÃ care to guard and watch and
propagate.
For lsstiaee. it wou'.d not be po^ibie
for a humane and Intelligent person to
Invent a rational excuse Tor slavery; yet
you will .-fmembcr that in the early flays
ef emancipation agitation in â¢â¢â¢ North
the agitators pot but rmall help or coun
tenance frcrn any one. Argu* nnd plead
ar.<J pray as they misht. thÂ«*y could not
break the universal Mlllne** that reigned,
from pulpit and pro** all the way down
to the bottom of societyâ the i-:.imrr still
r.ers created ar.d maintained by the He of
silent afFTtlonâ the ril'-nt assertion tj-at
there wasn't anything golr.g on In which
humane ar.d intelligent people were intci^
ested.
From the beginning of the Dreyfus case
to the end of It all France, except a
couple of dozen moral paladins, lay under
the smother of tbe silent-assertion He
that no wrong was being done to a per
secuted and unoffending man. The like
smother Â»>< over Enjrland lately, â  good
half of the population silently letting on
that they were not aware that Mr. Cham
berlain was trying to manufacture a war
in South Africa and was willing to ray
fancy prices for the material?.
Now there we have Instances of three
prominent ostensible civilizations work
ing the silent-assertion lie. Could one
find other instances In the three coun
tries? I think fo. JCot so very many,
perhaps, but say a billionâ Just to as to
keep within bounds. Are those countries
working? that kind of lie. day in and day
out. In thousands and thousands of va
rieties, without ever noting? Yes, we
know that to be true. The universal con
spiracy of the Bilcnt-assertlon lie is hard
at work always and everywhere, and al
ways in the interest of a stupidity or a
sham, never in the interest of a thins
fine or respectable. Is it the mn.Â« timid
and shabby of all lies? It seems to have
the look of it. For ages and aces it has
mutely labored in the interest of despot
isms and aristocracies and chattel slaver
ies, and military slaveries, and religious
flaveries. and has kopt thorn alive; keeps
them alive yet. here and there and yon
der, all about the globe; and will so on
keeping them nlive until the silent-asser
tion He retires from businessâ the silent
assertion that nothing: is going on which
f.iir and intelligent men are aware of and
ar* engaged by their duty to try to stop.
What I am arriving at Is this: When
whole races and peoples conspire to pro
pagate gfcant'.c mute lies in the interest
of tyrannies and shams, why should we
care anything about the trifling lies told
by Individuals? Why should we try to
make it appear that abstenslcn from
lying Is a \irtue? Why should we want
to beguile ourselves in that way? Why
should we without shame help the na
tion lie. and then be ashamed to d i a
little lying on our own account? Why
shouldn't we be honest and honorable,
and lie every time we get a chance? That
Is to say. why shouldn't we be consistent,
end â¬lther He nil the time or not â¢â¢ all?
Why should we help the nation lie the
whole day long and then object to telling
one little Individual private lie in-our own
interest to go to bed on? Just for the
refreshment of it. I mean, and to take
the rancid taste out of our mouth.
Here In England they have the oddest
ways. They won't tell a â poken lieâno
thing can persuade them. Except In a
large moral interest, like politics or re
ligion. I mean. To tell a ipokeg lie to
get even the poorest little personal ad
vantage out of it is a thing which is im
possible to them. -They makÂ» me asham
ed of myself sometimes, they are so big
oted. They will not even tell a lie for
the fun of it: they will not tell it when
It hasn't even a suggestion of damage or
advantage In it for any one. This has
a restraining influence upon me in splto
of reason, and I am always getting out
of practice.
Of course, they tell all sorts of little un
spoken lies. Just like anybody; but they
don't notice It until their attention Is
< ailed to it. They have got me so that
sometimes I never tell a verbal lie now
except In a modified form; and even In
the modified form they don't approve of
It. Still, that 1* as far as 1 can go In the
Interest of the growing friendly relations
between the two countries. 1 must keep
some of my self-resp-ct. And my health.
I un live on a pretty low diet, but I can't
get along on no sustenance at all.
Of course, there are time's when these
people have to come out with a spoken
He, lor that Is a thing which happens to
everybody once in a while, and would
happen to the angels if they came down
here much. Particularly to the angels, In
fact, for the 11. I ppeak of are self-sac
rificing ones told for a generous object,
not a mean one; but even when these peo

them and unsettle their minds. It is a
wonderful thing to see, and â hOWI that
they are all insane. In fact, it is a coun

superstitions.
I have an English friend of twenty-five
years' standing, and yesterday when we
were coming downtown on top of the bus
I happened to tell him a lie. A modified

THE SUNDAY CALL.
MARK TWAIN
In Austria last year. 1 do not know jrhat
might have becomÂ«: of me If I hadn't hap
pened to remember to tell the pollci- that
I belonged to the same family a* th-j
rrlnce of Wales. That made everything
pleasant and thoy let me go; and npolo-
Kiz.-d, too. and were ever ku kind and
otiiiKinp ami pulite. and couldn't do too
much for me. and explained how the mis
take came to be made, and promised to
hang thÂ«- Â«â¢ (fleer that did- it. and hoped I
would let by Runes be bygones and not say
anything about it: and I saM they rouM
Â«i- pend on me. My friend said, austerely:
"Too call it a modified lie? Where is
the modification?"
I explained that It lay in the form of
my statement to the police.
"I didn't say I belonged to the royal
family; 1 only ?aid I belonged to the same
tamlly aa the Princeâ meaning the human
family. Of course; and if those people had
had any penetration they would have
known it. I cant go around furnishing
brains to the police; It Is not to be ex
pected."
"How did you feel after that perform
ance?"
"Well, of course I was distressed to find
mat the j>olUÂ»j had misunderstood me. but
as long as I had not told any He I knew
tht-re was no occasion to sit up nights
an<J worry about It."
My frk-iid struggled with the < ase for
Mvenl minutes, turning It over and ex
amining It in his mind, then he Kaid that
so far as he could see the modification
was itself a He. It being a misleading
reservation of an explanatory fact, and so
I had told two lies instead of only one.
"I wouldn i have done It." suld he; "I
have never told a He. and I should be
very sorry to <lo surh a thing."
Jupt then he lifted his hat and pmiled a
basketful of surprised and delighted
smiles down at a gentleman who was
passing in a hansom.
"Who was mat. G.V"
#> I don't know."
"Then why did you do that?"
"Because I paw he thought he knew
me and was expecting it of mÂ«*. If I
hadn't done it he wouiu have been hurt.
I didn't want to embarrass him before the
whole street."
"Well, your heart wan right. <;.. and
ynur art was right. What you did was
kindly and courteous and beautiful. I
would have done it myself; but It will
lie."
"A lie? I didn't Bay a word. Hotr do
you make It out?"
"I know you didn't speak, -Ml' you snid

In dumb show. 'Hello! you in town? Aw

was what you have called a 'misleading
reservation of an explanatory fact'â the
fact that you had never seen him before.
You expresseu Joy in encountering himâ
a lie; and you made that reservationâan
other lie. It was r.iy pair over again. Bu:
don't be troubledâ we all do it."
Two hours later, at dinner, when Quite
ether matters were beii'g discussed, ho
told how ho happened along once, just In
the nick of time to do a great service for
a family who w-ro old friend* of his. T!nÂ»
head of It had suddenly died In circum
stances and surroundings of a ruinously
disgraceful character. If Known, the facts
would break the hearts of the tnnoo nt
family and put upon them a load of un
endurable shame. There was no help but
in a giant lie. and he girded up his loins
and told it.
"The family never found out. O.?"
"Never. In all these years they have
never suspected. They were proud of him
and always had reason to he: they aro
proud of htm yet. and to them his memory
la tarred and stainless and beautiful."
"They had a narrow escape, O."
"Indeed they had."
"For the very next man that came alonsr
might have been one of these heartiest
and shameless truth-nfingers. You havtj
told the truth a million times in your
life. G.. but that one gofden lie atones lor
it all Persevere."
Pome may think me not strict enough
In my morals, but that position is haroly
tenable. There are many kinds of lying
which I do not approve. I do not ilke
an Injurious He, except when it injures
somebody else: and 1 do not like the lie of
bravado, nor the lie of virtuous ecstasy;
thÂ» latter mi affected by Bryant, tnÂ«>
former by Carlyle.
Mr. Bryant paid. "Truth crushed to
earth will rise again." I have taken
medals at thirteen world* fairs, and may
claim to be not without capacity, but
I never told as big a one as that. Mr.
Bryant was playing to the gallery; we all
do It. Carlyle Bald, In substance, thisâ
1 do not remember the exact words:
"This gospel is eternalâ that a l:> shall
not Â»ive." I have â  reverent affection for
Carlyle's books, and have read his
"Revolution" fight times; and so I pre
fer to think he was not entirely at him-
KÂ»lf when he told that one. To me it is
plain that he paid it in a moment of ex
citement, when chasing Americans out of
his back yard with brickbats. They used
to go there aa<l worship. At bottom he
was probably nd of them, but he was
always able to conceal it. He kept bricks
for them, but be was not .i good shot, and
it Is matter of history that when he fired
they dodged and carried off the brick;
for as a nation we like relics, and ro long
as we get them we do not much care what
the reliquary thinks about it. I am quite
pure that when be told that large ono
about a He not being able to live he had
Just missed an American and was over
excited. He told it above thirty years
ago but 'â¢ is alive yet; alive, and very
healthy and hearty, and likely to outlive
any fact In history. Carlyle was truth
ful when calm, but give him Americans
enough and bricks enough and he could
have taken medals himself.
As regard! that time that Geor&e
Washington told the truth*, a word must
be laid of course. It is th*Â» principal
Jewel In the crown of America, and It
is but natural that we should work for
it for all it is worth, ns Milton tayi In
his "Lay of th* Last Minstrel." It was
a timely and Judicious truth, and I BBOttld
have told It xnysrlf In the rlrcurr.stanrfs.
Bu: I should have stopped there. It was
a stately truth, a lofty truthâ a Tower;
and I think It was a mistake to go on
and distract attention from Its sublim
ity by building another Tower alongside
of It fourteen times as high. 1 refer tn
his remark that he "could not lie." I
should have fed that to the marines; or
left It to Carlyle; it is Just In hia style.
It would have taken a medal at any Eu
ropean fair and would have got an Hon
orable Mention even at Chicago If It had
been saved tip. But let It pass: th*
Father of ills Country was cxcltel I
have been in those circumstances, and I
recollect.
With the truth he told I have nr> ob
jection to offer, ns already Indicated. I
think it was not premeditated, but an
inspiration. With his fine military mind.
he had probably arranged to let his
brother Edward in for the chrrry treÂ«
results, but by an Inspiration he kiw his
opportunity In time and took advantage
of It. By telling the truth he could as
tonish his father; hl3 father would tell
the neighbors: the neighbors would
spread It; It would travel to all firesides;
in the end It would make him President,
and not only that, but First President
He was a far-seeing boy and would b*
likely to think of these thing*. There
fore, to my mind, ho stands Justified for
what he did. But not for the other
Tower; it was a mlrtake. Still. 1 don't
know about that; upon reflection I think
perhaps It wasn't. For Indeed it is that
tower that makes the othÂ»r one live. If
he hadn't said "I cannot toll a lie" th*r^
would have been no convulsion. That was
the earthquake that rocked the planet.
That U th-:Â» kind of statement that lives
forever, and a fact barnacled to it has
a good chance to share its immortality.
To sum up, on the whole I am satisfied
with things the way they are. There is
a prejudice against the spoken 11-. but
none against any r>th<r. and by examina
tion and mathematical computation I find
that the proportion of the spoken lie to
the other varieties Is as 1 to 22JM. There
fore the spoken He Is of no conse
quence and It is not worth while to
go arour.d fussing about it and,
trying to make believe that It Is
an Important matter. The silent 10
lossal National Lie that is the support
and confederate of all the tyrannies and
shams and Inequalities and unfairnesses
that afflict the peoplesâ that is the one to
throw bricks and sermons at. But let v*

The almshonse was simply a large)

not many paupers in Oreen River; in
fact there were only five â three old wo
men and iv old men. besides Tommy and
Loreny.
The children went up the hill on which
the 11- ouse stood. The north wind

to get Into the nrrat warm kitchen where

There were no Christmas presents, but

they had eaten the roast turkey and

paupers had feasted, they had a little
time to themselves.
Loreny stole upstairs to her own room.
She got a pink calico apron in which her

a cold Christmas and the window was

their little mothers.
In mechanical toys there li little that is
very new. as In past years, so onÂ« of the
most prominent toy buyers explained,
they had proved unsalable. There are
still some few large animals shown. A
dandy turnout, with large sized horses,
boasting of a real hair coat â¢''!'â¢' driven in
in tandem, will make *nmc lucky lad hap

comfortably, and is so arranged that It
can be pushed from behind by another
child, so that the driver of â  tandem can
enjoy all the pkasures of a drive as he
proudly handles the reins.
The hobby horses are so lifelike as to
be almost real. A stall is shown which Is
Just as perfect In Its appointments as

pegs on which to hang It. Just as in a real

hay and raw, and all the comforts of a

"Judge and Jury" is another lively
grime. The Judge sits In a large arm
chair at the head, and the twelve Jury
men (of either sex and any age) In two
rows of chairs facing one another. The
Judge asks a question of one of the Jury
men, addressing him by the name of his
opposite neighbor. "Do you like this
game, Harry?" says the Judge. "Not at
all. my lud," replies Harry's vls-a-vls,
Nellie, promptly Jumping up and sitting
down again. "Do you think your hair
suits you, Nellie?" asks the Juilge, with
a critical glance. This Is too much
for Nellie, who replies promptly:
"Yes, I think it does!" "thereby breaking
every rule at once. No one must say
I "Yes" or "No," no one must omit to say
"my lud," no one must reply for himself,
but only for his opposite neighbor. It Is
also necessary to Jump up and make a
bow every time one Is addressed by the
judge. All these things has Nellie omitted,
therefore It Is necessary that she should
* herself assume the responsible position of
judge. She must stay In the Judge's chair
till she can catch somebody out, asking
questions which are likely to put them
off their guard.

The Irish mime of the town Is when

but Dublin wan never an Irish town. It
was founded by the Northmen and was
afterward the capital of the English Pale.

was little more than a raid. For cen
turier after his departure English power
was restricted to a few counties on the
Eastern shore In the vicinity of Dublin.
These counties were settled by English
adventurers much as our thirteen origi
nal States were colonized, by Europeans.
The Pale was made up of these counties
and Its limits varied from time to tim". <t
was not Irish; It was the English colony
in Irelarfd. Outside the Pale were the
"mere Irish." the treat Gaelic nation,
and between the two there was nothing
in common. For centuries it was savage
and truceless war.
Dublin, therefore, baa no Irish past. Its
cathedrals are Danish and Norman. Its
Parliament House-now the Bank of Ire
landâls built in the classic style fashion
able In England a century and a half ago.
1 know It Is the custom to apostrophize
that Parliament House, as If it were the
emblem of Irish nationality. When cer
tain Irish papers wish to be emphatically
patriotic they print it* picture In green
In front of a yellow sunburst and (lank
It with a wolf dog and a round tower,
nut that Parliament House represents
nothing Irish: that Parliament was
never an Irish assembly. It was the Par
liament of the Pale, and the Pale was
English. The heroes of the Pale. Swift
and Molyneux. Grattan and Flood, were
not Irish patriots. Swift bad not a drop
of Irish blood In his veins and hated the
"more Irish" with all the intensity of his
Intense nature. Flood to the end op
posed Catholic emancipationâ that is,
championed the, laws by which the Pale
Ftrove to crush out or brutalize the Gael.
Molyneux and Grattan and the. rest of
them bad a grievance against England,
but it \rÂ«Â» a grievance which began about
bad halfpence, and ended in a 'fiasco.
They masqueraded as the Irish nation.
but they were merely the English nation
In In-Innd. The real Irish nation did not
give a rau for the whole outfit. It did
not understand all this fuss about the,
Irish Parliament and cared nothing
when the act of union came to suppress
that vena! and disreputable assembly.
This Is the real explanation of the
apathy of the Irish of a hundred years
ago to movements that we have been
taught to look upon as Inspired by gen
uine Irish patriotism. Up to the treaty
of Limerick we had an Irish cause
defended in the Irish way and by Irish
weapons. The new lines of cleavage in
troduced by thÂ« Protestant revolution
had thrown many of the leaders of the
English Pale, on the Irish Bide. But oil
and water cannot mix. The Gaelic or
real Irish element was betrayed every

As iooil vi the troops had snlled away

and has kept them without arms since.
When they were thoroughly helpless the
s;iniÂ«' Kiijrllsh ..f the Palo let loose the
penal laws upon them to grind them into
the hogs and reduce them below the level
of the brute. Nearly all the time that
this sham Parliament wan sitting the real
Irishman, the descendant of the Gael, the
representative of historic Irish nationality
was not supposed hy the law to exist on
Irish coll. From the treaty of Limerick
until the time of O'Connell the Palesmen
âthat Is to say. the English in Ireland-
the patriots of that Parliamentâ deprived
the Gael of education and stole his
wealth. A hundred years of servitude had
left him Ignorant of his country's litera
ture and history. "When O'Connell arose,
the first Irish leader ulnce Limerick. the
clouds lay between him and the real Ire
land. Unfortunately he mistook his bear
ings. He looked at Grattan's Parliament
as his landmark. Where he raised the
people against the Pale and the bigotry
of the Pale he succeeded. His work was
emancipation. Where he took the Pale
and the Ideals of the Pale as the pro
gramme for the Irish people he failed,
and great and sad has been his failure.

The result of O'Connell's "repeal agita
tion was to break down the barriers that
Op to then had hedged the English nation
In Ireland and confined Its influence to
the wall* of. Dublin. The EngMshry who
in olden .lays had gone .among the Irish
were soon absorbed and became more Irish
than the Irish themselves. O'Connell re
versed the process. The tide of Anj,'lici
zation poured out over the whole land.
That pale and spotted reflection of the
Assembly at Westminster, known as Grat
tan's Parliament, became the day-star of
the Irish people. The patriots of the Pale
became their models. English ideas, Eng
lish customs, the English. speech slightly
tinged with local color were advanced
as genuine Irish products. The only real
Irish ideas, the ideas that ccme to us
from our Celtic ancestry, the only gen
uine Irish customs, the customs that an
tedate the Saxon In Britain, the only gen
uine Irish speech, the soft sweet speech
of the Gaelâ all these were branded as
vulgar and unprogresslve and youug
Irishmen were taught to model themselves
on the shabby copies of English shoddy
ism that posed in Dublin as the true and
only exponents of Irish patriotism.
The result of it all the stranger sees to
day In the streets, in the stores, in the
hotels, In the homes of the metropo.ls.
The Inhabitants of Dublin are no longer
Danes or Normans or English. During the
century every year has sent up the young
men and women from Gaelic Ireland to
settle In the city. But the Pale and the
spirit of the Pale has absorbed them all.
Their newspapers are English, mouthirig
much, some of them, about Irish nation
ality, hut modeled on English papers,
served by Journalists of English tralnli.g.
stuffed with clippings from English pa
pers. The Freeman's Journal, which pos^s
and has posed as far back as I remember
as the great national paper, is perhaps
the chief offender. A year ago it frottx^
at th* mouth on one page about '9S and
on thÂ» othrr smiled into "columns of "Gar

as the Pale now comprehends almost all
Ireland the contagion has spread far and
wide. The national schools have nothing
national about them. Their programmes
could be need In California, in Australia,
In Cape Colonyâ they are so colorless. In
the beginning the system was aggressive
ly British and Protestant. After half a
century of agitation it has been made non
sectarian and non-national. However. It
is doing England - work and ing. It well.
Three generations of the Irish have grrwn
up Ignorant of their country's history and
language. What Is worse; they are not
only Ignorant of these things, but they
despise '.hem. The Gaelic speech, which
had a literature when the Angl<Â»-Sax.>n

They banded themselves Into the Gaelic
League about six years go, and already
they have succeeded In awakening the
public conscience of Ireland to thÂ«Â» snd
condition of the national life. They take
as their starting point that Irishmen In
Ireland wish to remain Irish. If they go
to America lÂ°t them become Americans,
but if they are to remain In land they
must be Irish. If, therefore, they are
Irish they an- not English settlers In Ire
land; their lot i.- not with thÂ« Pale, hut
with the <;.i<i. The Irish nation of to
rlny must be contlnuoup with the Irish
nation of the past. The Irish nation of
thp past waa a Gaelic nation: therefore
tho Irish nation of to-day must be a
Gaelic nation.
The league is not afraid of taking a bold
stand. Language, it proclaims, is nation
ality A Frenchman speaks French, a
German speaks German, an Italian speaks
Italianâ why should not an Irishman
speak Irish?
Tho Irish aro a logical people, and when
the question Is put to them In this way
they recognise their duty. The Gaelic
League Is giving thorn no chance of re
maining Ignorant. It has Its organizers,
who Â£>< through the country founding lo
cal councils of the society. Groat public
meetings were held during th<- summer in
the Irish-speaklnÃ districts. The object of
these meetings is to destroy the old In
â¢enaate prejudice against the languageâ
the prejudice that made parents who
spoke nothing but Irish punlfh their chil
dren for Fpe&klng the mother tongue.
There are men In San Francisco who wero
whipped at home and at BCD because
they lisped naturally In the language their
parents spoke.
The first concern of the Gaelic Leaguo
therefore is to stop the decay of the lan
guage In the districts that are not yet
absorbed by the Pale. It Is a conserva
tive estimate to take the people who can
speak or understand Irish at a fourth of
the population. If those, who speak It will
teach It to their children and if those who
understand It will begin to use It a splen
did beginning will have been made. The
second Â«tcp then Is to Introduce the lan
guage Into the primary grades of the na
tional school and spread It through the
districts which have be< m.> English
speaking. An the Irish learned to speak
English In fifty years. It should not tnkÂ«
them half that time to relcarn their own
tongue.
Th.- Gaelic L*ague doe* not wish to hir
English, but between English and Irish
it prefers Irish. It says, and says with
reason, that there are only two postlbfo
futures before the countryâ either to be.
come a county of England or to b* Â»n

It is surprising how ready an acceptance
these Ideas rtnrl In the minds <.f the p*v>.
pie. Durtns a visit to Dublin last sum

the league to open It* annual course Â«>f
lectures. I gladly consented, and be

connection between the revival of the lan
pnaÃÂ« and the truÂ« MÂ«a of nationality. I
was surprised at the genuine enthusiasm
with which these Idea* wore received.
Tho audience was as noisy a* any that
ever occupied Metropolitan Temple. More
over, th" discussion on the subject was
general throughout the country. Thr<**
of the papers criticized thÂ«- thesis wh!"h
I had advanced, or., rather, having no
case, abused me because being what they
called a "returned American" I ventured
to express <â  opinion about the country
in which I was born. There are certain
Irish politicians who believe that people
who live in this country have only one
function in life, and th.it Is to contribute
cash to the various funds which theso
politicians Â»tart from time to time for
their own greater honor and glory.
The secret of the criticism was found In
tho suspicion of the politician* who
run the Freeman's Journal that the nÂ»w
movement would take ail the wind out
of their sails. The Irish parliamentari

of Parnell. their scandalous squabbles for

movements are nothing but pale. Inef

caliber Is about on a level with that of our

the county councils has thrown them Into
the background. The center of Irl3h In

In the two partiesâ Conservative and
Liberalâthe machine is In the hands of
the "gentlemen." Among the Tories the
rich and titled men rule; among the Lib
erals the rich and titled women. In tact,
th* party cf Gladstone is now the party
of the opulent female sex. Women who In
this country would devota their lives and
fortunes to works of i-harity or to the
founding cf universities in England plunge
into politics. Some briKht young man is
taken up by them as private secretary
and advanced. Soon he blossoms out ns a
candidate !ri the Liberal interest, nins his
seat in Parliament and Is fairly launched
In his career by tho.^e fairy godmothers.
The women gravitate naturally to tho
Liberal ;>arty because that, party has al
ways championed their interests; but U
must not be supposed that the ToriÂ«Â«.Â« are
destitute of female politicians of acknowl

The Kensit citation was in full blast
when I Â«as in London in the winter, and
it had not abated Its fury when : eamo
back in the summer. There is â  party in
the EriKlish established church which be
lieves that the settlements made by
Henry VIII. Edward and Elizabeth did
rot destroy the continuity of the estab
lishment with the Catholic church of pre
reformatlon days. The members of this
party rail themselves Catholics and re
pudiate the title of Protestant. They im
itate the Catholic church sometimes with
the most extraordinary results. Invest
ments, altar furnishings and ritual. They
teach practically the whole cycle of
Catholic doctrine. including, in pome
place.*, the primacy of the Tope. 'I hey
claim to have valid orders and to cele
brate mass. In fact, they Import Into the
Enpll.-h prayer-book such "Uomish prac
tices" as the u-M- of liÃhts and Intense,
the veneration of Images, ;h. shewing of
the Sacrament and a dozen more pecu-
llarltles supposed to have been banished
forever at the reformation. In St. Al
bans. Holhorn. they had as pretty a
"crib" at Christmas as I have ever seen.
The agitation arainst these practices
was started by one Kensit. a London
bookseller who has a little shop on Pater
noster row. Compared to the "Row" our
William street or Adelaide place is a
boulevard or a panhandle. Next door to
Kensit'a is a Catholic bookstore, and it
may be that it was the close proximity
of statues, pictures, rosary beads and
books of devotion that fired the "Protest
ant bookseller." m he styles himself, to
his sensational campaign. His practice is
to enter one of the ritualistic churches
during service, accompanied by a band of
sympathizers. "When th 2 objectionable
usages appear Kensit rises and protests.
Then follows what the lawyers term "a
brawl." There is a trial, tremendous agi
tation, letters without end in the news
papers, and the virtuous British public
indulges la Its favorite recreation com
THE SUNDAY CALL.
FATHER YORKE
monly known as a st.v* of mind.
The result of It all has been very se
rious for the establishment. The Bishops
appear to have taken the Protestant side.
The Anglo-Catholics, who have all along
been contending thai their church was a
branch of the Catholic church, are face to
fnce with the same condition of things
that met Newman and his companions
when the famous Tract XC was con
demned and the Bishops "charged" on the
Oxford movement.
The Liberal party, which accomplished
the disestablishment of the English
church In Ireland and attempted tho dis
establishment of tho English church In
"Wales, shows signs of a â¢'â  tire to make
the present troubles an argument for
diFestablishment in England. If the prop
osition should carry In all probability the
organization set up by Elisabeth would
break In two. The Protestant party
would form a denomination on the lines

If London is the center of the world*!
Commerce. Purls is the center of the
world's civilization. The modern city had
â :â¢Â»â¢ It." genesis and its inspiration. On
the Continent and In England, In this
country, from NY-.v York to San Francis
co, all the improvements achieved and
contemplated find their model In Paris.
When tin -v are tearing down block 3of
unsanitary buildings In London to make
Mr and splendid streets, they aw do
ins what Paris has already accomplished.
If we are. planning boulevards here In
San Francisco, It Is because the capital
of France has mown their possibility and
usefulness. In Paris one sees these "Im
provements" in their proper environment
and realizes the causes that necessitated
J.hem and moke them valuable. Too of
ten i fear In other cities they are like
the patent sidewalks of our boom towns
In the 'it â the wonder of tho tourist
and the playground of tho jackrabbit.
Then the French know how to use their
Ftreets. The great avenues are paved
with aspbaltum. but the pavement is giv
en tho care and attention that -i good
housekeeper will Rive, a carpet. It is not
left as our bitumen Is to swelter In the
sun, pitted with hoqf marks, neither Is It
In damp weather as the surface of an Ice
pond for the beasts of burden. A layer
.of clean sand is carefully spread over It
before the day's traffic begins and Is as
# carefully renewed when occasion requires.
The pavement Is thus protected, the scav
enging operations facilitated and horses
can bo driven at a moderate speed with
out risking their necks and the necks of
their drivers.
XIII.
I do not suppose that there is any city
In the world of which we receive such
conflicting accounts as of Paris. It Is
either the city of God or tho city of tho
devil. Some. return with talcs of its sin
and wickedness, others eec its norm] effort
and its charity. Truth to tell. Paris, like
every city In the world, has two sides.
There are many visitors to San Fran
cisco who go home with the Idea that wo
are a community of outlaws relieved by
an infusion of Chinese virtue. Those who
live in Baa Francisco know that what the
visitors see is but a small section of our
civic life, and that as far as our real
llff is concert ' we are no better, no
worse, than the citizens of any other
larpe city. So It Is In Paris. Those who
!.'â¢> there to find dirt and^depradation will
find it easily enough, but when they come
home with upraised hands and ratlins
eyes to denounce the Immorality of the
French, they condemn themselves, not
Paris.
Certainly I have not beard of any city
in the world where the works of charity
are more numerous and where more
money Is expended in the relief of human
misery. On every side are hospitals, the
best conducted on earth; on every side
retreats, asylums, charitable societies,
organizations to combat every form of
misfortune to which body or soul is heir.
No doubt there Is much Irrellgton In
Paris, but there is much Irrellpion In
every great city. As far as our statistics
po. not a third of our people in San Fran
cisco may be found In any church. In
Paris, unfortunately, through historic
circumstances, a portion of thi3 Irre-
Ufious majority Is actively hostile, to all
Christianity. With us the Irreligious ma
jority Is passive or well disposed. But thÂ«
iellglous part of the population does moro
for Its principles ;ind Its faith than any
similar number of men In the whole
world. The French contributions to re
ligious causes at home and abroad are
Stupendous. The devotion with which
Frenchmen give themselves and their per
sonal services In France and out of
France puts nations that boast mure to
the blush. The clergy of Paris work as
no other priests work. The number and
Ingenuity of the devices to bring people to
church and to the practices of their re
ligion are beyond description. And their
work Is not fruitless. One evening last
January 1 was In the church of St. Roch
and law it filled with thousands of men.
It was on a Wednesday evening: It was a
parish affair and the men were of the
people, they camo with their hands
grimed with toll and their clothes as they
left the workshop. The occasion was
what Is known as a Conference Contra
dlctolre, and gives us a good Idea of the
kind of work done in Purls.
A preacher Is chosen and selects a sub
ject usually a matter of discussion be
tween Christians and their opponents.
The sermon, or conference, la well adver
tised in the parish, and the chum Is re
served for men. On this occasion the
preacher had taken the question of the
Immortality of the soulâ Does anything of
us exist after death, or do we wholly
die and cease to be? Ah, In the case of
those long churchea In France, the pul
pit Is placed half way down the nave
and against the left wall. Opposite the
pulpit and facing it Is a bench whereon
sit the parish priest, his assistants and
the church wardens. The rest of the
congregation uae chairs, which, to-night
are free. The exercise opens with the
singing of a hymn In French and a
short form of night prayers. Then the
sermon commences. Hardly, however has
the preacher got well Into his subject
when he Is Interrupted. There Is a dev
il's advocate on the bench opposite He
Is usually a priest of the parish, but he
, takes the argument of the speaker, tears
it to pieces and throws at him the ob
j>ctlons that would com* from an inidejl.
couched In the very language whlrh the
fellows of these workmen would use.
Needless to nay, there Is tremendous at
tention. Every few moments the preacher
Is Interrupted. Sometimes the objector
raises a smile, sometimes the laugh in
on the side, of the preacher. The whole
thing 1h excellent. an>l cannot fall to give,
the hearers a hold of the subject discussed
that will enable them to reply to their
AntagonlstÃ on tnÂ»j street, the workshop
or the store.

France. is republican. The confusion*
of the past few years show that th*
third republic Is chosen of the people. It
Is not an Ideal republic, but Its futuro Is
to be perfected, not overthrown. It has
enemies without and within. The sup
porters of the half-dozen lost causes art
not Inactive, but their divisions render
them powerless. Except Switzerland,
every other form of government In Eu
rope, Is monarchical, and monarchies do
nrÂ«t love a successful government of the
people and by thÂ« people and for the peo
ple. Still, they cannot interfere. A gen
eral European conflict would. lit the. opin
ion of many, be a calamity as awful as
the downfall of the Roma empire. Th*Â»
great monarchies are not Inclined to
tempt Providence, for they remember ih*t
once upon a time, when ail Europe was In
a coalition against France, the genius of
Napoleon and the valor of the French
held them all at b;iv. It Is to he. hoped
that a country which has done, so much
for humanity may hayÂ« tho opportunity
of working out hor destiny In pÂ«ace.
Peace and religionâ these are the two
conditions of French prosperity and suc
cess. The revolutions of the past hun
dred years have left deep marks on thÂ«
social and spiritual organizations In
France. It will take tir: and much ef
fort to efface them. The present pontiff,
Leo XIII. has again ami again urged on,
the French Catholics the necessity of ral
lying to the support of the republic.
When men are agreed about the perma
nency of the social fabric It will be easier
to make such changes In it as right rea
son direct?. When men fear that the loos
ening of a brick will bring down the wholo
house, they are ><ct against any alteration.
Internal peace therefore Is the first re
quisite for France's happiness, and with
internal peace would come religion.
The religious* condition of France l<
much like the religious condition of Paris.
Th. Catholics who are Cuthollcs are thÂ«
best and most generous In the world, but
Ihe indifferent and the apathetic? are In
the majority. Unfortunately this Indiffer
ence is accompanied by n relaxation of
morals which i- sapping the life of the
country. Herein Is France's greatest
danger. Without morality there can bÂ«
no genuine public llfo or tonal suc
cess.
The Louvre, the palace of the ancient
kings, is now a palace of the people. The
treasures of Franc**, th. treasures of all
the outside nations are gathered there,
examples of the beautiful that the brains
of men conceived and that the hands of
men bodied forth. In the picture gallery
Is Ary Schaeffcr's Monica and Augustine.
Every one has seen at least a reproduc
tion of It. The mother la clad in white
and her pale face Is turned toward heav
en. The son, young and swarthy and
strong, follows her pise and the beauty
of holiness is reflected from his counte
nance. Thus the eye of the trti.-r saw
them at <>Â«tia when the saint had recov
ered the child whoso soul was pledged to
herâ the child of many tears.
As I stood before that picture It seerred
to mo an allegory of France. The strong,
hot blood oi Augustine had driven him
from his mother's roof and estranged him
from the teachings of his early years.
Yet there was always In him that splen
did rnge against Injustice, that all-con
suming desjre for truth. His vices â¢Â«â¢â¢<Â»
the exaggerations of virtues, and even In
them, as he says himself, hÂ» was faith
ful. Such a soul could not be lost. It was
too fine to remain among the grosser
things of this worldâ ln the wildest of its
wanderings Its eyes were upon the stars.
Even so was it with France. - Mk nÂ«
one may of the revolution and its ex
cesses; of the mistake? and follies nf this
century and their consequences; admit to>
the ..I the crime and the wickedness ami
the Injustice and the Irrcllglon: yet tn,
borne sort it all has been, as it were, the
aberration of freedom and inÂ« stumbling
of men whose eyes are fixed too Infntl
l> upon the right. Rut all this cannot last
always. The country of St. Louis an-l of
the Maid cannot ho cast off forever. The
warm blood will cool, the heart will beat
less passionately; the eye Will see morn
clearly; the feet will move more steadily;
and then the France of the martyrs nnd
the confessors; the France of the noble
and lofty thoughts; the France of tÂ»iÂ«
chivalrous and hlgh-soulci deeds will
shine once more with the beauty of holi
ness, for 1 1 is Impossible that a nation of
such achievements for God and -ium.it .ty
should utterly perish.
â¢ â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢
Hut here 1 must halt. My wandering
have be*n so erratic, my discursiveness
so uncontrolled, that I have only got as
far as Pnrts and have seen so little In Â»hÂ©
way. This Is the main trouble about th<Â»
record of a wander-year. There 1* so much
to see. so much to think about, so much
to speak about. But even a Christmas
Call has limits and the patience of read
ers Is short. Perhaps on sonu other oc
casion I may have an opportunity to con
tinue my record. I do not claim for it
scientific accuracyâ lt merely tells the Im
pressions that were made on me. Others
will Judge of the same facts In another
fashion. Others seek other theories tn ac
count for the same conditions. I eel down
things merely as they appeared to ire.
When I began this paper I planned to go
down through Italy and return by tne
Tyrol, but Dublin detained me so long and
the question of Irish nationality proved
so alluring that my plans went all . *i-v.
However. I am not particularly sorry.
This is thÂ© record of my wander-year nnrl

IN "They That Walk in Darkness" Mr.
Zangwiil has repnntÂ»d the "Ghetto
Tragedies." with a number of moro
.recent tales. That Mrange union of
, stolid vulgarity and polflshness with
pectic intensity and spiritual lire which
has marked the Jew since the days of
Moses nnd the prophets is Riven a vivid
cxpresrlon in Mr. ZanffwlirÂ« tragic tales.
The equally paradoxical combination, of
external formalism and genuine freedom
of thought which has made the synagogue
a powerful force in the spread of ideas is
likewise made abundantly clear by him.
The ditc existence of such books as
thefe. !:r.dlrg in Jewish lif* subjects of
artistic contemplation which are of Jn
tcreft to Jew and Gentile alike a- mem
bers r.f a tingle intellectual community,
is evidence that the energy of Judaism
i* a separate moral force Is beginning to
be spent. It is In the transition from
"orthodox" to "liberal" Judaism that thÂ«
power of the most tragic tali s is to be
found. The tales themselves, bearing wlt
r.ess to the. beauty and influence of old
usages, are quiet victories of liberalism.
In his preface Mr. Zangwill tells his
readers that "Satan Mekatrib" was writ
ten in IS'?. "Bethulah" ten years later,
and he challenges hln critics to decide
whether his powers have waned or de
veloped in the period between the writing
cf the first story and of the second. There
!â  the same force, there are the *amÂ«
sources of interest. The second story is
WÂ« explosive and less constantly kept to a
hlph strain than the first. At th* wmn
time it mey bo lc?s profound and orig
inal. The art of it is probably more fin-
Ifchcd. for here and there in "Satan Meka
trib" the dust is thrown about unneces
rarily. while In "Rethulah" fitness and
case are always present.
Except for this greater symmetry and
rmoothne:-*. liowevcr, Zangwill .1* the
fame ZangWill who took the world's
breath away by his audacity when ilrst
1:1s Ghetto taks appeared. All his writ
ing hes one weaknessâ it impresses the
reader si? a tour Â«1c force, as a piece of
tiiumphar.t cleverness. All of it exhibits
th* Fame virile Intensity, the same st^rn
power of rejecting the unessential, the

The letters to newspapers written by
Mr. William Archer, the English theat
rical critic, during his visit to the United
Btatrs have been collected in a book
which bears the title "America To-Day. "
Mr. Archer forestalls the critic ready with
h'.s easy sneÂ«Â«r at travelers who look
through a car window at the farms be,
tween Squcdunk and Ponkapog lons
enough to wink twice at them, and who
then hurry home to write books on Amer
ican life. He ir.akes no pretense to a
knowledpe of the real America, and say?
that he ha? had only a supcrrtcial glimpse
of one corner of the United States. "It
1b as thouph one were to glance at a merÂ»
dograr on a folio page, and th^n profess
to have mastered its whole port." Mr.
Archer need not have been so modest, for
he had evidently studied and thought
ir.uch about America while he was in
England, and his observations were In
many cases the March for answers to th*
Intelligent ouej-tions he put to himself be
fore landing in New York. A man so
rrepared can learn much in a few weeks.
Mr. Archer makes non<Â» of the general
crit!<lsmj on America which sometimes
Irritate Americans and Fr>mrtime* set
them to thlnklnp. according to the critic's
orutrn^ss and tact. His severest censure
Is resÂ»rved for American barbers. With
attractive tmnhrmlf he d^Firibrs his own
discomfiture by a bnrber's unwelcome ob
trusiveness.and hars^h looks. Indeed. Mr.
Archer's account of his awe rouses a
grave suspicion in his reader's mind.
Ac.-.. .-.:â â¢ hll will he submitted to rr.nssag
ir.p. parboiling, rssencing nnd anointing:
finally had a tip wrung from him and
fed. He showed nothing of that splen
did hectoring energy In assertir.B his
r nhts. by which an Englishman puts an
American to thane. We have been
taught to believe that timidity In de
manding the satis-f.i'-tion of our own Ideas
of comfort Is an American trait. â  -in it
be that Mr. Archer is not a typical Eng
llshman. and that his Jack of real British
character is the pround of that facile
ndaptatlon to American circumstances
which is so flatterlr.K to us? Were Amer
icans so like Englishmen to him because
he Ml in American without knowlnp it?
One interrstlnp fmture of Mr. Archer's
reflections is the larpe place taken In
thrm by the really upliftirij; ard cUlliz-
Jrp forces In Am^iUan life. H<> dwells
on university curri< uiiini mid American
library buildlnKs. on Hull House and Con
cordânot en the American system of
bappape checks and the lustiness of
Americnn Ftreets.
Mr. Archer's fimmiT.ts on the relation
between Oroat Hritaln and America nrc
acute and profound. HÂ«Â» sensibly casts
ridicule on the idea of Anglo-Saxon kin
fhlp of hlond. the notions of alliance and
the sentimental twaddle about the love
Of the mother country which have beÂ«Â«n
tired recently. At the tame tlmo he rec
ognizes the existence of a peculiar cloph
rie.j;s of relationship between England and
America and traces this relationship to
Its true source. America Ss akin to Eng
lar.d because American ideals of govern
ments of society, of manhood are In es
sence Unrlish Ideals of government, of
society. </f manhood. When a foreigner
Is Americanized he Ik !â¢<â Â» because he Is
Imbued with notions Inherited by America
from England. Private law In detail and
public law in essence; religion In great
rneaujre; manners In some decree; stand
ards of duty and order, all the^e America
and England have in common. Above all,
by speaklnÃ the same language Â«nd pos
pept-lng a common literature we belong to
a i-lrjf|p community of thought, the extent
and variety of which plve us â¢ . thing

son never grew to manhood.. and in read
ing the letters one feels the note of youth

that "manners should be human and cen

So It was with Stevenson. He knew

It la, however, not the etalrctwcs of
Dukes and Queens which have most In
terested the authors, but the stones hal
lowed by association with poets and men
of thought. The chapters bear the titles:
"The Scholars' Quarter of the Middle
Ages"; "The Paris of Mollere"; "The
Paris of Honore de Balzac"; "The Paris
of Alexandre Dumas"; "The Paris of Vic
tor Hugo." In these literary chapters
there are many Interesting anecdotes, but
there Is also much that except to a very
great lover of each poet must be dull and
a little trivial. The sense of the past Is
all very well, but the sense of the past Is
not gratified by a sight of the windows of
the room where Alphonse Daudet wrote
"Fromont jeune et Risler alne." The
chapters at the end on "The Making of
the Marals. " and "The Women of the
"Marals" ere more Interesting, for In
them we watch the movement of human
ity up and down the pame streets and
through the same halls, one figure after
another, sad or splendid, lovable or
wicked, gay or serene, parsing and dis
appearing.
The authors' writing seems to bear the
mark of great accuracy and single-heart
ed earnestness. As a guidebook to un
noticed places of historic interest "The

PRESIDENT WHEELER ON THE
GREEK FAITH IN IM
MORTALITY.
Not all men of to-day profess an Inter
est In everything that the (Jreeks of old
saJd and did; yet It remains true to a f;ir
greater degree than Is often realized that
It Is to them that we owe the elements of
our culture and that by no means only In
the field of the arts and of literature ar*
they cur masters, but that In the field of
science as well -of science In Its broadest
F Â«Â» nÃ< Â»_they laid the foundations wnerton
we build.
It Is not alone their achievements,
great as tliese achievements were, that
Impress us; it 2s also, and, perhaps, even
more strikingly, the nature that Is thin
brought nut Into clear relief; the restless
energy, the fearless, persistent search for
truth, the hearty and unflinching accept
ance of what reason holds to be true, the
sanity of Judgment, and the serently of
temper In the face of life's most baffling
problemsâ these things when taken In
connection with the achievements of the
Greeks in art and In literature. In science
and In metaphysics. In politics and in
ethics, have given them their unique po
nition. And It Is a striking fact that In
the last years of this busy, restless nine
teenth century better work is being done
In the interpretation of Greek life and
Greek thought than was ever done before
âand that not alone because the labors
of the past have made better v.ork pos
sible.
A little book has Just Issued from the
Riverside Press that should be widely
read: for while all may not have known
of the Ingersoll lectureship at Harvard
on the Immortality of man. yet an Inter
pretation by President Wheeler of the
Greek view of life after death will Inter
est many. And the little book will Â» a t
lsfy all demands raised by a mention of
the author* name. It is learned with
a touch of pedantry and Is written In

Of the many questions that suggest

us most nearly is this: Had this faith â¢
the Greeks in a life after death any direct
bearing upon conduct? mrect
In the Homeric age the conception of
Immortality was not one to bring ho Dâ¬ of
comfort or solace. And. when we put
with this Homer 1 * clear vision of mortal
lot and the inevitable end of all in* Li
may fee that his view of Ufe and deaTh
Is a melancholy one. "Even as are the
generations of leaves such are those like
wise of men; the leaves that the wind
scattereth on the earth, and the forest
buddeth and putteth forth more again
when the season of spring la at -nd so
of the generations of men onÂ« upringeth
and another passeth away." And what
more cheerless than the picture* of th*
Btatfl of th*Â« "strengthlcss heads Of thÂ«
dead," flitting in an almles*. Joyless ex
istence through 'the mlats and darkness,
of a world of gloom! Yet. In the face of
this, the Impression left by Homer Is not
melancholic. Is as far removed from mor

of the Greek temper.

when there was more or lens Interchange

at last she could tulk to Will Gray; and
when midnight came she knew that now

Drayton* purposed visiting the hospital
the following afternoon, and long" before

Bhe was there with flowers us winsome as
her smile, and some jelly as dainty as her
own fair hands. She was there, and the
Instant the hour sounded waa ushered in,
and Billy Gray, propped on his pillows,
was writing to hla fattier, and alone. No
time was to l>e la*t. Any moment the at
tendant might return, the threw herself

rot. seized his hand in hers and looked
him in the face. "Where are the)'. Will?"
she pleaded. "Quick! 1 must have them

had died its dfath. Then it was' useless
to hint at love; and in a torrent of Im

gratitude and honor, and there, too,
failed, for. admitting all she claimed, he
clumsily, haltingly, yet honestly told her

"You mad fool!" she cried. "Do you

and turning ber .yelgi to tee, she grasped
at the flimsy framework that purported
the netting over the cot and stood sway-

her and the door, two papers in his half

and too well known, cut her to thÂ» very

tone the words:
"Mrs. Garrison, here are two reasons
why you will do nothing of the kind.
Shall I hand these to General Draytonâ
or to your husband?"
CHAPTER XVIII
The long wait for the coming of the
big transports with the. regulars was over.
For the Jirst time In history America was
sending her soldiery past the pyramids
and tnrouerh the Indian Sea; landing
them, after forty days and nights of voy
aging, upon the low, flat shores that hem
Manila Bay, and shoving them out to th<Â»
hostile front before thÂ«ir sea-legs could

of a veteran, our Yankee "Tommies"

trudged away to the pouts assigned th*m.
and once more the army assumed the

and a grave-faced colonel of Infantry
could have told of causes little dreamed
of In th* regimentâ were either given to
telling the naif of what he knew.
That eomething most unusual had oc
curred In the room of Mr. Gray the day
that the sad-faced, kind old general visit
ed the hospital at least half a dozen
patients could have told; for an attendant
went running for one of the men
nurses, and the doctor himself hurried to
the scene. It was on his arm that, half
an hour later, Mrs. Garrison slowly de
scended the stairs, her flimsy white veil
down, and silently bowed her thanks and
adieux as the doctor closed the door of
her carriage and nodded to the little
coachman. It was the doctor who sug
gested to Colonel Frost that Manila air
was not conducive to his wife's recovery,
and recommended Nagasaki as the place
for her recuperation until he could Join
her and take her home.
The Esmeralda bore the White Sisters
over Hongkong way within a week: and
they left without flourish of trumpet, with
har.lly the flutter of a handkerchief; for.
since ihf battle of the sth of February,
neither had been seen Â»Â»n the Luneta.
Their wnm^n friends were very few: the
men they km w were mainly at the front.
The Mory got out somehow that Garrison
had asked to be relieved from further duty
as aid-de-camp and returned to duty with
with his regiment and that Drayton would
not have It. The general manner toward
that hard working staff officer, though
often tireocoupifd as of old. grew even
kinder. He <lld not see the listers off for
China, he was "far too busy" was the ex
planation: but he offered Garrison a fort
night's leave, and urged his taking It. and
was obviously troubled when Garrison de
clined. ''You need rest and the char.<-- of
air more than any man I know," said he;
but Garrison replied that ohange oX scene
and air would not help. him.
There were two young fellows In khaki
uniforms landed from the hospital launch
on the back trip from Corregidor one
warm March day. One wore the badge of
a subaltern of the teenth Regulars, the
other the chevrons of a corporal and the
hatband of a famous fighting regiment, of
volunteers: yet the same carriage bore
them swiftly through the sentineled
streets of the walled city, and the guards
at the Ayuntamiento sprang to their arms
and formed ranks at sight of it, then dis
persed at the low-toned command of Its
commander when it was seen that Instead
of stopping at the curb and discharging
an elderly general officer, it whirled
straight by and held two youths In field
uniform.
"One of 'em's young Gray of the
âteenth; he that was hit In the charge
on the Pasay road," said the officer of the
guard to a comrade. "But who the devil's
the other? He had corporal's chevron's
on. Some fellow Just got a commission.
perhaps. And that was the only way
the soldier could account for a corporal
riding with a commissioned officer In a
general's carriage. . They had a long whirl
ahead of them, these two; and the cor
poral told Gray, as he already had the
general and Colonel Armstrong, much of
the story of his friendship for "Pat" La
trobe, of that Door fellow's illness at Ban
Francisco, and all the trouble It cost his
friend and chum. There was a strong
bond between them, he explained; and
the blush of shame that stole up In the
face of the narrator found instant an
swer In that of BUly Gray. Determined
.to Â»ac wrvio* Â«J the, front ajij not >Â«
turn to punishment In his regiment, never
dreaming 1 that. in quitting a corps doomed
apparently to inaction at home and join
ing one going straight to the enemy's
country he was committing the grave
crime of desertion. "Gov. Prime had
spoken to some men In Stewart's regiment
and was bidden to come along and fetch
his friend, for they were just as Ignorant
as he. Having still considerable money
"Got." had bought civilian clothes and all
the supplies they needed while about
town, and hired a boat that rowed them,
with certain items contraband of war, to
the dark side of the transport as night
fall came, and they were easily smug
gled aboard and Into uniform, and then,
during the few days' stay at Honolulu,
were formally enlisted and no einbarras
ing questions asked.
And now poor Pat was gone and Prime's
father had been cabling for him to re
turn home; but there was that awkward
matter about the desertion. General
Drayton was trying to have it straight
ened out at Washington; for hÂ«Â» bad been
kindness itself the da) of his visit to
the hospital, wher* almost his first act
had been to seek out the wounded young,
soldier who had been his beloved nephew's
boon companion and at one time sole sun
port The sentry was relieved of his sur
veillance and Corporal Norton trans
ferred to Corregidur to recuperate; and
now that both lads were well on â¢'...â¢ road
to recovery. Drayton had Bent for them.
Strictly speaking. some one should have
seen to it tb.'it Corporal Norton of the
volunteer! was shift I hack to Private
Norton of the - teenth, and the chevrons
stripped from hi sleeves; but no one had
cared to interfere where the worsted was
concerned, especially as the boy hart won

and stepping forward, held oat a hand to
each.
"I want you, boys," said he. "to be
ready to take the next transport home.
The doctors say you need a sea voyage,
Gray; bo there Is the order. The doctors
say your father needs you. Prime; and
the record will be duly straightened out
in Washington â the charge of desertion,
no doubt, will be removed. It's a matter
of Influence. To-night you dine with me
here; and I have asked your good friend,
Colonel Armstrong, to come."
Again the blood rose guiltily to Billy's
cheek. Not yet had he mado his peace
with bis conscience and that valued coun
selor and Invaluable friend from whose
good graces he seemed to have fallen en
tirely. Not once had opportunity been
afforded in which to speak and open his
heart to him. As for writing, that seem
ed Impossible. Billy could handle *almoit
any Implement better than a pen. But
even in the few minutes left him In which
to think he knew that now at least he
must "face the music." like the man his
father would have him be. even though it
took more nerve than did that perilous
dash on the Tagal works that Sunday
morning. Billy would rather do thrit
twice over than have to fa Armstrong's
stern, searching eyes, and hear again the
cold, almost contemptuous tone In which
the colonel saM to him the .lay the doctor
led hi* vanquished and hysterical charmer
from the room: "Don't try to thank, man.
try to think what you riskâwhat you.dft
serve to loseâ for putting yourself In the
power of such a woman."
From V At 447 until this, her* on the
banks of the swlft-runr.lng Past*. they
had not met at all; and It seemed to
tiray as though Armstrong had aged a
year. Them was a lump in his threat as
he went straight up to the colonel, his
blue eyes never flinching, though th*>y
seemed to nil. and bravely spoke. "Col
onel Armstrong. I have an explanation
that I owe to you. Will you give me a
few minutes on in* gallery?"
"Certainly, dray." was the calm reply;
and the youne*ter led the way.
It was a broken story- It told of h!s
desperation and misery through Canker's
persecution. 01 his severe illness, then of
the,utter"weakne?!Â» and prostration: then
her coming, arM with hor comfort, peace,
reassurance, gradual return to health,
and with that, gradual surrender to hi*

upon htm. .her plea, her final Insistence
that he shouiu provÂ« his gratitude and
devotion by getting for her those danger
ous letters, and his weakness In letting
her believe he could and would do so.
That was the situation when they went
on to Manila; and Armstrong knew the
restâ knew that but for his timely aid she
might have triumphed over his repent
ance; but Armstrong had come, had van
quished her and poor . Latrobe's last
wishes were observed. The fateful packet
containing the three letters that were
most Important was placed In his uncle's
trembling hand.
"But how was Itâ what was It that no
utterly crushed her?" aoked Hilly, when
the colonel had once m re extended his
hand.

own guilt." said Armstrong gravely. "One

general's Irish orderlyâ to search for a
packet of letters that had come by mall,
and must be In the general's tent, either
about his desk or overcoat, and to bring
them at once to room number so and so
at the Palace. Of course neither the gen
eral nor Garrison was there when h* ar
rived with them: but she was and with
all her fascinations. She got the Irish
man half drunk and told him a piteous
story and made him swear he'd never tell
the general or anybody. If questioned he
could plead he had gone out. andâ 'rot a

moneyâ a big bit. too; and he got mire

In the silence that followed thÂ« soldier
of forty and the lad of only twenty-one
sat looking gravely Into each other's face,
It was Armstrong who spoke again:

asm.
"I did not," was thÂ» answerâ "that Is
on the 3ed>rwiek"; and the gentleman
halted lamely and glanced furtively Â« n .l
appeaiingly at his wife. There was that
embarrassing. Interrogative silence that
makes one feel the futility of conceal
ment. It was Mlsj Lawronce who cam*
to his relief and dispelled the strain en thÂ»
situation.
"I should fancy very few army, people
would choose that roundabout way from
Manila when they can come direct by
transport and baTÂ« the ship to them
selves."
"Wellâ Â«râ res: c*rlain!y,cÂ«Â»rt*inly." an
swered the helpless master of the house,
dodging now the warning and reproach in
the eyes of his wiser mate at the other
end of the table. The crack of a coach
man's whip and the swift beat of trnttlnf
hoofs on the graveled road In front â  â â¢;": l
be heard as he faltered on. The gleam of
cab lights oame floating through tha
northward shrubbery. "Except, of course,
when they happen to beâ ejâ a!r*.idv.well,
you know, at Hongkong or Nagasaki," ba
lamely concluded.
There was an instant hurried glance Â«x
changed between Gray and Prim-. Then
up spoke In silvery tone their ".â â -:<â¢â Â«:
"Other officers, you know, arc ordered
home. We have Ju*t heard to-day that
Color. Frost comes very soon. His nealttx
"'-ran quite shattered. I believeâ you
knewâ of themâ slightlyâ that Is to say.
Miss Prime, did you not?" But even with
her words she ca.Â«t an anxious, furtive
glance along the dim reach of the laoai.
for the plt-a-pat of footfalls, the swish of
feminine draperies, was distinctly heard.
Two dainty, white-robed tonal rams
floating Into view. and. with changing col
or, their hostess suddenly arose and
stepped forward to meet them. Just enÂ©
second of silence Intervened, tMen. all
grace and gladness, smiles and cordiality
both her little hands , outstretched. Mrs.
Frank Garrison came dancing Into their
midst, her sister more timidly following
"Dear Mrs. Marsden. how perfectly

right on the Doric, but I had to bring her
out with me that you might hare Just
one glance at her. Way: Mr Prime!
Why, what could be more charming than
to find you here? And 'Gov.' tooâ you
wicked boy! What won't I do to you for
never telling me you were In Manila?
And Mildred!" tkisaâ kiss. de-;'"Â« a pal
pable dodge and nelfftitened color on the
part of the half-dazed recipient*. "And
you, too. Miss Lawrence?" (Eoth hands,
but no kiss â one hand calmly pted.)
"Ah. then I know how happy you are,
Mr. Willie Gray"' (beaming arch smiles
upon that flushed and flustered youns

And so the swift play of words went on,

Between the meat and game courses the
heaviness of ft dinner will be relieved if
Ices, punches or sherbets are served. Any
kind liked may be served, but It Is a
pretty idea to carry out the color of the
dinner in this course. For instance, If the
decorations be red. cranberry frape should
be served, or raspberry Ice.

ENGLAND THREATENED
BY THE FRENCH PRESS
PARIS. Dec 15â For the first time this
week Parisians met hoarse-voiced news
venders running along the boulevards to
day shouting "Crashing defeat of the
English." "Great victory for the Boers."
and displaying the front sheets of their
papers bearing big headlines. "The Eng
lish Routed!" etc. The French people
hÂ«-ard and read the newt with interest and
discussed the British defeats In the parks
and cafes without a display of Borrow or
sympathy for the British, but at the
same time without any outward demon
stration of gleeful satisfaction that could
be regarded as offensive to the British
spectators. The violently "Anglophobe
press." such as I.* Libre Parole and La
Patrle. naturally treat the British dis
asters as Joyful tidings, but the respecta
ble Journalsâ Temps. Le Journal dcs
Debats. La Llberte and othersâ discuss
the news soberly and moderately.
Le- Journal dcs Debats expresses admi
ration at the wonderful calmness and
sangfroid with which the British nation
has met blow after blow. The paper con
cludes Its article with the remark that it
would be a heavy blow to the social or
ganization of Great Britain If Chamber
laln"s venture brings her to conscription.
Le Temps also comments upon the
weakness of Great Britain's army to
cope with the present emerÃency, and
FTUCE FIVE CENT9L
says: "Chamberlain lit - suspected that
the letting loose of this war was going to
reveal the Insufficiency of the military
forces or the British colossus."
Ia Patrle. which tells Its readers that
Chamberlain is seeking to bring about a
war with France In order to restore In the
eyes of Europe Great Britain's prestige,
so shaken by the Â»lt- feats of her nrmy by
the Boers, says that a few more disasters
like those at JlagersfontHn and Tugel.i
River will mean a British war with
France In the coming spring, and declares
that the concentration of the French
northern fleet ct Brest and the recall of
the Mediterranean squadron to Toulon aro
the first precautionary measures taken by
the French authorities.
"The British army." I.a Patrl* adds,
"has lived a century on the reputation of
the Duke of Wellington, and perhaps thÂ«
navy also lives solely on the reputation of
Nelson. The war In the Transvaal has
demonstrated the weak points of the Brit
ish army, the weakness of the Brit
ish empire, the Incapacity of Its military
chiefs, and the fictitious strength of Its
troops, who have only had to fight sav
ages."
The same paper publishes the report of
an Interview with a French genera!.
whose name Is not given, who describes
the Ignorance displayed by the Brit! of

the Boers are evidently superior In tactics
and strategy and perhaps In courage.

LONDON, Dec 16 -The grave situation
confronting Great Britain In South Africa
almost obliterates the effect of the speech
of the German Minister of Foreign Af
fairs. Count yon Uulow. In the Reichstag
on Monday last. Though scarcely any
announcement of recent years has had so
much bearing on the future of Europe. In
spite or the uninformed comment In some
English quarters that Count yon Buluw
spoke merely for political effectâ ln other
words. "Jollied" the Reichstag by means
of jingoistic sophistries, for home con
sumption, to vote for the navyâ in Vienna,
which is In closer touch with Berlin than
any other capital. Count yon Bulow is in
terpreted as flinging down the gauntlet to
Great Britain. The Neve Frele Presse,
which has personal connection with the
Foreign Minister of Germany, declares
Germany is determined to obtain the
greatest possible advantage from the
South African complications, and adds:
"The cool mention of England dissipates
all apprehensions caused by Emperor
William's stay at Windsor, and it is not
Impossible that England's difficulty may.

opportunity."
The Vienna correspondent of thÂ« Stand- 1
ard, detailing much similar comment, re
iterates what has often been heard here,
namely, that Great Britain is more hated
on the Continent on account of her In
terference in behalf of the Uoitod States
when the latter was at war with Spain
than for any other recent cause. Why
Count yon Billow should have gone out
of his way to Indicate the possibility of
Great Britain's hostility and belittle tho
friendship between her and Germany la
an enigma yet unsolved by any British
authority. A consensus of the best
opinion tends to the belief that the Ger
man Minister wished to offset Mr. Cham
berlain's rash speech at Leicester. Yet
this seems a small excuse for such lan
guage at this period, while the sugges
tion that Count yon Bulow spoke for
purely political effect la dismissed as be
ing entirely uncharacteristic of tho man
who a. rapidly achieving tho reputation
of being the first statesman In Europe.
"So far," says the Saturday Review,
referring to the war, "we have been able
to answer each reverse by the potent ar
gument of another division, but that can
not last forever."
Such an expression, appearing In an
ultra-conservative and optimistic publica
tion. is significant.
While the Yon Bulow anti-Britishisms
have not stirred up criticism, the public Is
Just beginning to realize that with 100,000
men in the Held no progress is being made
In any direction, and Klmberl<-y and
Ladysmlth seem as far off as ever from
thÂ« promised lief.
While General Buller's reverse was an
unexpected blow to the public that had
pinned its faith to him. ft would appear
that the original plan of campaign, if ad
hered to. would have given better. results,
for the besieged towns have shown them
selves quite capable of holding out. As
it Is now. tha British forces are split up,
havo been seriously repulsed, are unable
to co-operate, and. at any rate for the
present, are unable to reach their ob
jective. It was for this plan that the cen
tral advance was sacrificed. Even it"'? re
llef of Ladysmlth can scarcely have great
alleviating consequences to the campaign,
na a whole, unless Its moral effect quiets
the growing disaffection in Cape Colony
and disheartens the Boers to a more seri
ous extent than their other minor re
verses have bo far done.
But. however looked at. the British po
sition Is most unenviable, and there Is a
great cry for more troops. Lord London
derry urges the War Office to send out
100.000 more men, saying: "Conceive tho
effect on the empire If Methuen Is forced
to surrender."
The St. James Gazette caps this with
the Intimation that the treasury Is with
holding the funds necessary to send out
reinforcements, adding:
"If this Is so, even Lord Salisbury's re
luctance to sacrifice a colleague will not
serve to shield a minister who stands be
tween England and the restoration of her
damaged superiority In South Africa."
On the other hand, there are many mag
nificent examples, through public speeches
and editorials, of the great common sense
which is the backbone of the nation.
There are people who Implore Englishmen
not to make fools of themselves, and not
to Imagine that a few reverses make it
necessary to drain the country of every
man able to carry a rifle. The volunteers
are greatly worked up and numbers of ap
plications to serve In regiments have been
received. ThÂ« Associated Press learns,
however, that Lord Wolseley believes that,
though these men are excellent aÂ«Â» volun

MISSOURI DOCTOR TO
INOCULATE THE POPE
WITH GOAT'S LYMPH
CHICAGO. Dec. 16. -Word comes from Rome that the medical attendants of Pope L#o XIII are seriously considering
the advisability of inoculating the Holy Father with Boat's lymph In the hope of counteracting the ellects 01
senility from which he Is now suffering. . â
Dr. U. F. Roberts, a Missouri physician, who has won fame by discovering a means of utilizing the cura
tive properties of the lymph by keeping the cells in an active state, is now In Rome, where he has been in
guest of Dr. Baldwin, a resident of the American Colony, who holds the important post of adviser to the mea
cal staff at the Vatican, and also to the royal family of Italy. Dr. Roberts wrote to friends in this city some days ago
that he had discussed the merits of the lymph with Baldwin. The latter had become interested In the matter ana nau
suggested that he be supplied with samples of the fluid in order to acquaint himself with Its properties and its e fleets on
the human system, with the purpose of recommending Its use to the Pope's physicians In case he found it suitable to tnÂ«
pontiff's malady.
Shortly after the receipt of word from Dr. Roberts a gentleman interested In the matter left Chicago for Rome to
consult with the former and Dr. Baldwin, taking with him a consignment of the lymph for the latter's use. This was
especially prepared for the purpose at the lymph laboratory in this city.

FEDERATION TAKES ACTION

Delegates at Detroit Adopt a Resolu
tion for an Investigation of
the Coeur d'AlenÂ©
Affair.
â¦
Special Dispatch to T?ie Call.
DETROIT. Mich., Dec. 16.-The Ameri
can Federation of Labor this afternoon
registered an emphatic disapproval of
Government subsidies to American ship
owners, and later declared almost unani
mously against the principle and practice
of subsidy legislation. Incidentally some
more or less distinguished lobbyists, some
of them Federal office holders, who had
been lobbying to secure the indorsement
of the subsidy I ill, suffered a decided de
feat. The debate lasted three hours and
the speeches were the most vigorous of
any heard in the convention during the
week it has been in session, bat only two
of the several speakers supported the sub
sidy Idea.
The convention declined to adopt'a res
olution concerning the Idaho miners and
military difficulty, which declared that
"i\e do hereby emphatically condemn and
denounce President McKlnley, Governor
Steunenberg and all the officials con
cerned In the outrage," and which called
upon the working people "to sever their
connection with and refuse any support
to the Republican and Democratic par
ties." etc.
A substitute for the latter resolution
was adopted, which, after reciting that
Innocent men had been incarcerated with
out reference to their constitutional
rights, protests against and condemns
the alleged Inhuman action* by the au
thorities and directs the executive council
of the federation "to make full investiga
tion and place the responsibility where it
properly belongs."
President Gompers presided this after
noon for the first time. The question of a
declaration on the subject or ship subsi
dies was raised by the bringing In of two
resolutions, one from the boiler makers
and iron snip builders, favoring subsidy
legislation, the other opposing ship sub
sidies. The resolutions committee offered
as a substitute for both a resolution de
claring that since the natural resources of
America offer abundantly everything nec
essary to the building of ships much more
cheaply than In Europeâ
Resolved, That while be favor an Increased
national merchant marine, we are opposed to
any and all subsidies, believing the Industry
able to care for ltÂ«elf.
Delegate William Oillhouse of thÂ« boiler
makers argued for subsidy legislation.
Delegate Warner of the New York ma
chinists asserted that as far as truckmen
engaged In such building trades were con
cerned there was plenty of work. A tele
gram was read from San Francisco stat
ing that the Union Iron Works could not
get men enough. Warner declared that
the only opposition to the elght-nour
movement in Congress came from tnose
in the ship building.
Vice President Duncan said he had not
met the lobbyists present, but he under
stood their alms, lie offered the follow
ing addition to the committee's substitute
resolution:
Resolved further. That we are decidedly op
posed to nil legislation of this kind, and will
not give It consideration until the great ship
building firms of the country, which would be
ltn greatest beneficiaries, withdraw their oppo
sition to the eight-hour workday legislation
and cease their discrimination against the em
ployment of union workmen.
Max S. Hayes of Cleveland believed that
Whatever the convention mljfht do "it
th;it pane of hungry vultures about
Washington want this they'll get it, the
nam-j as the tariff barons got their spe
cial protection years ago." It was ;nie
lid. that labor built the ships, built
everything, "but how much dues labor
own?" Ho argued for less ships and less
work and the getting down to a more so
cialistli 1..
Hayes' stormy remarks brought the
loudest applause of the convention.
Delegate Andrew Furuseth, of the Sea
men's Union. d#ni#d that it cost more in
operate American ships than otheru. or
that the American seamen's treatment
was better. He charged that, stowed
away In the recesses of the subsidy bill
was a re-enactment of the English press
gang Idea.
President Oompers told the convention
of some previous interviews with him by
promoters of the bill, and said the latter
declined to give any assistance toward
passing an eight-hour law. Said Mr
Oompers:
"Tnls scheme for looting the treasury
of our country Is puerile In conception
and wicked In execution, and these lobby
ists have not the Interest* of organised
labor at heart."
After considerable further discussion
Duncan's amendment was accepted by
the resolutions committee and tne reeo
lutlon as so amended was adopted by the
convention, with but three adverse i vu Â«.

SOLDIERS CHANCES OF DEATH.
Not More Than One In a Thousand
Projectiles Take Effect.
It la certainly a crumb of comfort to a
man about to tight for his country to
know that In battle not more than one m
every thousand projectiles of all descrip
tions and weight take effect.
Competent authorities state than on the
average it takes a ton of shot to kill one
man. i-"or instance, it has boon estimated
that In the Crimean war the British and
French troops Bred between them the
enormous amount of 4j.ouu,iwo projectile*,
resulting in the death of only ol.otW Rus
sians, while on their side the Czar's ad
herents killed some 46,( of the allies with
an expenditure of over W.QuO.twu projectiles,
this representing a death for every lUS7
shots tired.
The American Civil War return*, which
were got out with very great care,
show that the loss to both tne Federals
and Contederates was about 7 per cent
of the forces engaged, to bring about
which involved the expenditure of nearly
twenty-two hundredweight of ammuni
tion per man.
At the siege of Mezlerea, In the Franco-
German war. the i'russians threw no
fewer than 197.0 projectiles into the ill
fated town, but, strange to say, less than J
400 people were killed by them. Then, nt â 
Trouvllle. two people only were killed,
after more than 27,<ax/ shells, had been dis
charged. At Sedan, however, the aim of I
both the Germans and the French showed
a marked improvement, for after 24u,(wJ
projectiles had been fired nearly 9000 I
French and Prussians were killed.
For the Spanish-American war the re- '
turns .showed a tremendous amount of I
shot and shell fired for very meager re- |
sults. Of course. In this case, although
the mortality was not great, the damage
to earthworks, fortifications and Govern
ment buildings generally waa enormous, '
and there can be Jlttle doubt that if the !
Spaniards had Dot made themselves
scarce the deathroll would have been ai>- '
palUngr.
Again, when the American marines '
landed at Santiago during a fusillade
upon the enemy lasting two nights, the
machine guns and rifles alone accounted i
for the consumption of over 2J.U00 rounds
of ammunition. Sixty-eight dead Span
iards were found as a result of this enor
mous expenditure of ammunition.
Our own experience in our "little wars"
has been very little. If any, better than
the results just recorded. Take, for in
stance, the Chartered Company's expedi
tion Into Matabeleland. Every one will
remember how the warriors of L>obengula
were mowed down by the Maxim guns j
like skittles, but even In this Instance,
which, perhaps. Is the most effective
on record, as the imp! advanced on the
British lines In solid masses, It would
have puzzled a blind man to have missed
shooting sumo of thorn. The mortality
was very email considering the vast num
ber of cartridges expended, but this Is ac
counted for by the fact that on examina
tion some of the dead bodies contained
more than fifty bullets In each. On an
other occasion, at an attack on a laager
some twenty miles south of Buluwayo,
U.w.Â«o round* of ammunition were disposed
of. with a result of Mi dead Matabele.
Military authorities now regard rapidity
of fire as being more essential than rangi
and precision, and content themselves
with giving general orders to aim low,
and this, perhaps, account* for the fact
that most wounds are Inflicted on the en
emy's lower extremities, statistics show-
Ing that on the average 45 per cent of the
wounds occur In the legs, 33 per cent In
the abdomen. 21 per cent In the arms and
chest and only 1 per cent In the head.
It will be interesting to learn how many
Boer bullets It takes to kill a British sol
dier, and vice versa. If only for the sake
of really ascertaining whether the Trans
vaal burghers' abilities as crack shots
have not been considerably overrated.â

subject, which Consul General Mason re
tards as the. most Important matter In the

As a result of the Inquiries, It may be
Â»ald that the plans have not been de

establish several branch institutions, one
at Hamburg, another at Stutqjart. or
Frankfort and one central In Berlin. How

marks about German relations with the
L Ulttrd States and Groat Britain. Count
Posadowskl-WVhner Paid he regretted
that "our commercial relations with
America are not wholly koo.l, but I am
convinced that right and justice In this !
are on our side." Then, talking abuut the 'â¢
necessity for a lamer German navy, he
said: "Th* real propelling cause Is that
the commerce of tha world undivided
should not go wholly to Kngland and !
America, for which purpoFc %\Â« must be
prepared to be >imllarly si rung, us those
powers."
Another remarkable feature of Count I
rosadowskl-Wehner* speech was the part i
In which he ridiculed the Agrarian ro..- :
slcke. who had upheld the Boer States as !
political economic Ideals for the Herman
nation.
Herr Richter's throe-hour oration was '
replete with witticisms aÂ« usual. One of '
the most effective was when referring to I
the groundless rumors about the Danish '
\Ve.Â«t Indies, he said: "No wonder with I
seventeen millions paid for the, Caroline â¢
Islands, that we are bulling the. market '
and prompting all oth<?r countries to pon- '
dor whether they have not some old caÂ«t- I
off pair of Inlands to sell "
Jkrr Rlckert-who spoke In the name of
the pro-nuvy Radicals, pointed out that |
the proposed naval Increase was a popular
mowment. adding: "Things which the '
people do not want, not even the might
iest monarch or the mightiest statesman
can carry."
The. dt-epest and most lasting Impression
was produced by Count yon Bulow's sol
emn and puthetlc rations when tne
Reichstag adjourned.
ThÂ«- attitude of th^ different parties to
ward the naval bill Is not yet clearly de
flr.Â«Â«d. but from inquiries made by the cor
respondent of the Associated Press among
the different faction leaden It can be said
that the chances of the bill's pas>-agti are
most bright.
From an authentic source the corre
spondent hears regarding the "open door" I
in China that thÂ« Washington Government I
has not yet asked any other power be
tides Germany to furnish assurances ver
bal or written, to maintain the open door '
but now that Germany's answer is entire
ly favorable all the other powers Inter
ested will be. askÂ«-d. Including' Prance
Russia. Italy and Great Britain. It is ex
pected that all of thf>m will answer fa
vorably, except perhaps Russia, but it Is
hoped that strong moral pressure can
then be brought to bear on Russia to
yield.
Fevero cold weather and snowstorms
have prevailed throughout Germany this
week, and this has produced considerable
suffering. Prom all tho larger cities there ,
are reports to that effect and there hayÂ« '
been many deaths due to exposure In
Berlin alone there wero eight deaths "from
exposure during the last four days The
temperature was lower than for years

MANILA. Dec. 16.â Major Peyton C.

abandoned his pursuit of AKUlnaldo and
has reached Hagner., In the heart of trfÂ»
Grand Cordillera, where the range Is 10.000
feet high and where food Is scarce and
travel almost impossible. From native
couriers and Spanish prisoners It was
learned that Agulnaldo left Bontoc. in the
province of the same name, with three
women mid two soldiers, three days Igo
a;ul headed southward, evidently for Bay
otnbong, in the province of New Vlzcayai
where it is thought ho may encounter the

Scattered bards of Macabebes. which
have been operating In the north, are be
ing collected with the intention of sending
them back to Manila, as there Is much
slcknes among them and they are unfit
for further mountain work.
Lieutenant Chadwlck and a correspond
ent of the Associated Frees, the latter
commanding thirty Macabebes, visited the
mountain town of Pamposano and re
ceived the surrender of a company of In
surgents, Including three officers, with
their arms and ammunition.
Genera! Conception and other Filipino
officers who have surrendered have been
taken to Vlgan. Concepclon, who is cheer
ful, insists that the Insurgent organiza
tion will be maintained even in the dls
trKts here the Americans are operating,
claiming that tho Filipinos can use their
troops whenever they desire. He suggests
that the only method of terminating the
war is the capture of Agiiinaldo and the
obtaining of an order from him for fie
troops to surrender thÂ«-lr arms. But Cun
oepelon believes Agulnaldo will never be
captured.

COST IN BLOOD
Of All the Wars Since the Days of
the Trojans.
Beginning with the Trojan war, which
Is usually regarded .18 thÂ© first chapter
In European and Asiatic history. It Is cal
culated that war has claimed 40.000,000 of
men every century. In Europe alone the
loss of lives every 100 years since the date
of that war has been between 18,000,000 and
20.0<0.000. Three thousand fears have
elapsed since that opening chapter of his- :
tory was unrolled, so thai during those
thirty centuries the almost Inconceivable,
number of U200.000.000 men, women and
children have been sacrificed to settle dis
putes concerning some few miles of ter
ritory, to gratify the ambition of some
monarch, or to soothe the wounded van
ity of rulers and states.
The present population of the globe Is
estimated at 1.400.000.000, therefore If all
Seople alive at this moment were stricken
own simultaneously by some fell disease
the awful result would be but little more
terrible than the result brought about by
the wars of the centuries.
In the war that raged between 1793 and
ISIS no fewer than 1.900.000 men were either
killed outright or died from wounds and
disease. In the campaign of is:> the num
ber was 120,000. In the Crimean war the
losses sustained by the four countries
which participated amounted to the ter
rible figure of 000.000. In ISI the French
and Austrian forces suffered to the ex
tent of 63,000. while In thÂ« Civil War In
the United States the victims numbered
GM5.000. The Franco-Prussian war caused
the denth of 200.000 and the Russo-Turkiah
war meant death to lS",0uo men

that may be wrought In one battle two

Musical Silence.
One evening Sir Arthur Sullivan went to
see Rubinstein at his house in London
n poser asked his visitor to
step out on the balcony and smoke a
cigarette. They sat down, twisted their
cigarette* and puffed the blue clouds Into
the air. After a long pause Sullivan ob
serred!
"You arc a great admirer of Beethoven,
I presume?"
"Yes." answered Rubinstein.
"Ami W:Â«Riier?"
"No," was the. reply.
That was all. ;^ot another word was
spoken. They rocked themselves In their
chairs and smoked awuy. After a long
time Sullivan remarked:" ..'
"I think It- is time for mo to be- going "
"Don't say so," said Rubinstein. "Stay
a bit longer. It Is so nice to talk to you '"
Sullivan remained, went on rocking him

when he at length got up and said:
"I must really be oft now. l think we

"Our English and German brethren

are likely to reap advantages which
American capital, curiously enough, thus
far more timid than they, has been slow

Scorpions Do Not Suicide.
An Interesting question has from time to
time been discussed by naturalists and
physiologist*, as to whether the scorpion
commits suicide by stinging himself with
his own venomous dart. Experiments have
often been made, which consist In sur
rounding the scorpion with a circle of
flre. usually formed by small pice* of
burning coals.
One may then see the animal agitate his
tall In the air. waving his dart to and fro
over his head In a desperate movement,
and finally fall dead, appearing to have
decided that he could not escape the
flames and to have Inoculated himself
with his own venom, says the Scientific
American. This Idea Is now. however,
found to bo erroneous, as it has been
proved that the scorpion is not affected by
his own venomous fluid, and the hypothe
sis of his BUicldfl cannot be maintained.
it appear* from later observations made
upon Ihe death of the .scorpion under the
conditions In question that a more simple
explanation Is to be found.
Scorpions are. In fact, sensitive to heat,
and are easily killed by a temperature not
exceeding 00 degrees centigrade. If one
concentrates the solar rays upon a scor
pion's back by means of a lens one may
observe that be tries by means of his tail
to remove the cause of discomfort, it Is
this movement of defense which lias hith
erto been mistaken for one of suicide, an.l
In reality the scorpion has been killed by
the heal to which he baa been exposed
under such circumstances.

Vanilla Poisoning.
Interest almost fearful attaches to nc
counta of poisoning by substances in com
mon use, and the Interest becomes most
painful when we learn how dilTlcult It Is
to provide against It.-, occurrence. Vanilla
Is .1 case In point. Thanks to luck more
than anything: else, cases of poisoning
from this source are rare.
Nineteen persons, one 6f whom died,
suffered severely from eating vanila
cream composed of milk, eggs and sugar,
flavored with vanilla (the commercial
article prepared from oonlferln). The dish
had been cooked In the evening and *'.
lowed to stand uncovered until next da jr.
Investigation showed the eggs and sugar
were good, the milk was harmless and the
vanillin pure.. The fact that the. rook find
landlady, who had merely tasted the. dish,
had also become, seriously Hi suggested
the idea that the poisonous agent might
have undergone further development after
being swallowedâ that It was bacterial.
To prove this, a chemist boiled three
flanks containing respectively plain milk,
milk flavored with vanillin and a solution
of vanillin in water, and then lei them
stand eighteen hours tn a cold tempera*
ture. Some of the contents- of each :'.:i-lt
were injected Into mice. The milk flavored
with vanillin proved poisonous, the other
two harmless.

Twenty Dollars a Month for Light
A strange case has come up In -Mil
waukee, where the owner of a busit.rs*
block haa been obliged to pay S-1) a month
for the privilege of having sunlight In
one window of his building. A tirm had
rented a room In this building on condi
tion that It be provided with natural light.
This was effected by cutting a window In
the wall overlooking the property of. a
neighbor. ThÂ© latter prompt! shut off
the light with a light wood screen. When
remonstrated with he took the position
that the light was his. and that as he had
a right to erect a building on his lot he
had a right to put up any kind of a struc
ture permitted by law. An lnqulrv by the
attorney for the other party developed no
flaw In the position taken by the light
purveyor, and his terms of $2if per month
had to be met. Hi* neighbors, lie said,
could have nothing belonging to him with
out paving for It. Our friends the single
taxers are loudly rejoicing over this,
claiming that It It* exactly what Is being
done with land. They say If It were as
easy to corner sunlight and air a* It If to
get control of the natural opportunities
offered by land the human racÂ»> would be
In a good deal worse fix than It Is. and we
would Boon be taking out our license to
live.

people upon the proposition that they
could be made happy by increased taxa
tion. In view of that prophesy Grosvenor
thought the Republicans could view with
equanimity Bailey's forebodings of ye..=tor
day.
Clark of Missouri made an amusing
speech, poking fun at the Republicans for i
their efforts to secure consolation from \
the late elections.
Mahon of Pennsylvania criticised Bailey
for not frankly admitting, as Slbley of
Pennsylvania hnd done, that the return
of prosperity was due to the restoration
:of the Republican party to power. Levy
of New York announced his Intention to
v<itÂ«Â« for the bill, although li<- did not agree
with some of its provisions.
Fitzgerald of New York announced his
intention to vote for the bin, j>ut bitterly
denounced Its banking feature. He gave I
it as his opinion that the enactment of i
the bill into law would be of Incalculable
nerviee to the Democratic party In remov
ing the money question from politics for

Norton of Ohio expressed the belief that
the pending bill was the culmination of a
gigantic money trust. This trust, he de
clared, was at the foundation of the al
liance between Great Britain and the '
T'nlted States, which existed at this hour.
The Republicans Jeered this utterance.
The Democrats gave Glynn of New York
a round of applauso when he announced
that he would keep step with the National
Democracy and vote against the bill.

on both sides of the House.
The debate then lapsed Into dullness for
a Â» hour. Later Lentz (D.) of Ohio
charged that tlio pending bill had been
prepured by the 3GW national banks a Â»â 
cret combination that wielded more Influ
ence than the Masonic fraternity, thÂ« odd
Fellows and the P.ed Men combined. The
bill was intended to Increase the powers
of the national banks. All the rest that
was In It was already In the law. As he
proceeded Dalits* remarks became- sensa
tional.
"We are In favor of renomlnatlng Wil

followed the debate he must have heard
pome strong speeches In favor of free sil

but one section of the bill haÂ« been read
harged that the special order which
did not permit the offering of a substitute
or a motion to recommit had been framed
for the fesix-clal purpose of preventing the
offering <>f ;t fr.-<- silver substitute.
"Does the gentleman dosire to offer such
a substitute?" asked Uverstreet (R.) of i

" Phe ri:le was framed to prevent one

that he would dare expect to rally his

A dozen Dem m rats jumped to their feet
as Dal/ell concluded Hailey. Richardson,
Sulzer of New York, Williams of Missis

but Hepburn, who was in the chair, recog
nized Dolllver. The lowan looked across
the aisle when order had been restored.
"Before I begin." paid ho blandly, "I

Williams. "We challenge you for the op

Rushing down one of the side aisles
came 1 riggF of New York, shouting::
"1 object- I object."
"Docs the gentleman want any further
evidence?" called Williams.
The confusion was Indescribable. Hep
burn pounded his gavel, while the Repub

was restored Deliver yielded to Bailey
who preferred the request for unanimous
consent.
"The gentleman from Texas." said Hep

"Your bluff is called, ' shouted Williams,
his index nger pointing to Dolllver. while
the .Democrats cheered lustily.
Meantime the hour of 5 o'clock arrived
and the committee arose and reported the
bill to the House without amendment.
Lentz (D.) of Ohio asked whether it

URGES CALL OF
EXTRA SESSION
Administration Consid

Special Dispatch to The Cai\.
CAIXi MEADQI-ARTERS, WELLING
TON' HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Dec. 16.â
The Call correspondent learns from high
authority that as a matter of party ex
pediency the administration Is urging a
call of the Pennsylvania and California
Legislatures for the election of Senators
from those two States. This nn :ms that
the President realizes the difficulty of
seating Quay and the party confusion
that would* follow should the Governor of
California carry out his expressed Inten
tions of appointing Burns, who Is so ob
jectionable to many leading Republicans
from that State.
Whilo the administration has thus far
: taken a neutral position In relation to
! Quay's case. Senator Hanna has Intelv
expressed the opinion to other Republican
j leaders that It would be advantage
the Republican party If the Senate avoid
1 a vote in the Q-iay cas.'. Senator Aldrlch
is also understood to be of the camu
opinion, and the Influence of many of the
tl is now being brought to bear
] upon Governor Stone in hope that he will
, call a special session of the Pennsylvania
iuture in order that Quay may have
another chance to fight his battle at
Lome, and if he again fails the Itepubli
â  an members of that tody will be able
[ to unite upon another Republican.
The battle of lawyers over the Quay
was begun ut the Capitol to-day,
when the Senate Committee on Privileges
"'"I Election! 1i.~t.-n.-d to arguments as to
nsiitution.-il right of the Governor
of a State tÂ«i appoint to a vacancy hap

Slate Attorney General Blklns In d<
of tii<- Governor's ri^ln to appoint and >>f
.Mr. Quay's right to his seat. Argu
were contined to the legal aspect of the
case.
The only â rmitlonal development of the
flay Â«au caused bj Benator Penrose.
Quay's earnest lieutenant Mr i
was arguing when Mr. Penrose interjected
an abrupt query whether Mr. < "arson and
in> associates were not under pay of Mr
Wanamaker. This Mr Carson indignant
ly denied, and Benator Penrose was made.
aware of the impropriety of his question
by Senator Pettus. Senator Penrose
Hushing in embarrassment, lapsed into
silence.
In his argument Mr. Elkins contended
that n sovereign HtatÂ«- was at all times
entitled t>-> full representation in the Sen
ate According to the spirit and letti
institution. The intention of the
framers of the constitution was to k-.>p
the representation of each State complete
and he maintained that the Governor'
having authority to appoint a Senator to'
fill a vacancy caused by death, resigna
tion, disqualification or expulsion, <iad
nlso full power to appoint In case the Leg.
Islature railed of Its duty to elect Former
Senator Edmunds declared that authority
to make appointments was constantls- be
ing Intrenched upon by executive power
not only of States, but of the nation itself'
The President, he Bald, was exercising
such power by making recess appolnt
m< nts of men who had previously been
rejected by the Senate. This he regarded
as dangerous. f<nd hÂ»> urged the Senate to
take a linn stand against suÂ«'h usurpation
of power as a protection to Itself.
Mr. Edmunds maintained that tho va
cancy having occurred during the session
of the Legislature, and that after the va
cancy had occurred the Legislature had
endeavored but fniled to elect, the Gov
ernor was barred from exercising hi.i con
stitutional right to appoint.
After hearing the arguments thÂ« com
mittee adjourned without attempting to
consider its report, announcement being
that a meeting for that purpose
would ).<* called for the first Friday after
the holidays. It may be accepted as a
foregone conclusion that an adverse re
port will be made by tho committee. There
will be a minority report In favor of â¢at-

any such radical change*. The commit
tee was appointed for the purpose of a*- j
sist ins in every honorable way the elec
tion of the ticket nominated and to ar
range the preliminaries for the next con
vention. Changes in the basts of repre
sentation, he ihoUKht. should be left to
the convention to deal with. He lid not '
believe that the committee should make
recommendations to Congress as to lects
latlon. In their individual capacity mem
bers could ask their Senators and Repre
sentatives to bring about tuch legislation
as they favored, but the committee, he
thought, should maintain its position as
an organization to conduct the affairs of \
the party under the instructions of the j
convention. If It assumed more it would
be charged with dictation. Hanna's re
niarks- were chÂ«-ered by the committee.
Sane of thÂ«- other propositions on this ;
buUjcct were brought forward.
The sub-commime on arrangements for
the convention was announced as follows:
Manlcy of Maine, chairman: Payne of
Wisconsin, Scott of West Virginia. Kerens
n{ Missouri. Kean of New Jersey, with
Hanii.-i and Dick, chairman and secretary
Â«>f thr* National Committee, ex-ofllcio
members.
ThÂ« selection of delegates from the Dis- '
triet of Columbia was referred to an elec- '
tion board.
Th'T" was fnmÂ« talk about the large
representation from Territories, but no ac
tion was taken. The committee adjourned
subject to the call of the chairman, it he
ir. g explained that it will assemble a few
â¢lays before thÂ«> <-nnvention meets to make
up the preliminary roll of delegates.

Rarely, indeed, is the State, either in the country or
in its cities, more beautiful or more joyous than at
this time.' A 6 one parses along the streets or the
highways there are to be seen roses lifting their
rr-cal beauty high in air and violets nestling in the

the pemra! gladness of every aspect of nature.

IMPERIAL DESTINY.
THE British aggressions upon the South African
republics began with the cry, "Gold and
Glory-" Accustomed to contempt for the rights
of the weak, and led on by thirst for empire, Great
Britain has entered upon the estate of all peoples who
were too weak to defend it. In her campaigns of
forcible annexation, which by the moral code is
criminal aggression, her policy begat imitators in the
United States, the last place on earth where they
should have been found. She entered upon this
South African war in the spirit of smug hypocrisy,
which equips unjust conquest everywhere. She wns
re of her ground that the St. James Garette said
two months ago: "We have been obliged to fight
again because our last war there was grossly misman
aged and shame'uliy concluded. It left unsettled the
question which it was begun to settle; it exasperated
race hatreds, which it should have laid to rest for
ever, it left a deeper injury still behind it, an injury
to the British name and fame, not in South Africa
alone, but in ether quarters of the world where the
maintenance of that fame is necessary while the em
- continues to exist. The first battle of this cam
is over, our first victory has been won, and
:y a very different idea of our resources has been
impressed upon the minds of our opponents. But this
is not all. Preparations are still going on upon a
scale which the most timid of our advisers would
admit to be more than adequate to the immediate
business of the Transvaal, even to extended troubles
in South Africa. The reserves and the militia have
been called out, the channel squadron is on the alert
and a naval activity it in progress which extends far
beyond the mere necessity of conveying troops fmm
theÂ«e shores to the Cape. All this evidently means
that no mere questions of franchise, no mere argu
ments about suzerainty, pressing as these may be in
themÂ«e!veÂ«. are now in the minds of Ministers re
sponsible for the safety and honor of this country.
The political horizon seemed unclouded when Sir
Alfred Milner began his long negotiations after the
Rloernfontcin conference had failed. But the inter
nal atmosphere is evidently heavily charpol with
electricity to-day, and the ultimatum of President
Kruprr has. possibly to his own knowledge, set free
the current? that may work havoc in regions far from
the S>/-.:th African Republic, unless we are prepared
to deal with them."
This is a most extraordinary exhibition of fear an<l
effrontery. The last war referred to ended at Ingogo
heights and Maiuba Hill and was followed by a
that of 1881, in which the suzerainty
Britain was acknowledged in international
affairs, and the independence of the Transvaal iras
expressly admitted. This was modified by the treaty
- j, in which the word suzerainty WSJ omitted and
England was piven six months to object to any
treaty the Trr.nsvaal might make.
The treaties of iWi and 18^4 were in solemn set
"it of all questions involved in the war that
ended at Majaba HilL What folly, then, is the claim
â¢..is left unsettled!
The Gazette frit certain that the Transvaal busi
ness was provided for last October, and was so sure
c round that the rest of the world was bullied
and threatened by suggesting the channel squadron
and pointing to military preparations more extensive
â ay trouble in South Africa could possibly re
quire.
A rude awakening has followed. Ore after another
White. Gatacre, Methuen and Buller have been de
feated by the republican army. Their guns have been
red, their forces decimated, their retreat com-
lluller's defeat is the most significant martial event
:ipped with the best field artillery
in the world, his latteries have been c by mm
m thr <â , and his gunners were 5<
denly overpowered that they had no time to spike or
c machinery of thrir guns. The English
â ting their reward. Pitj I that the
punishment falls on brave men who are guiltless of
the policy of greed and imperialism to which they
are victims. That ; ed the diamond mines at
Kimberley by an act which the English historian,
Fronde, denounced as "perhaps the most discrt<:
incident in British colonial history." Today Mr.
lain, who forced the hand of the Queen and
bury, i- safe in London, and his partner in
the crime of grocd and in the policy of "Gold and
â â â .-." Cecil Rhodes, is pent up in Kimberley,
guarding a treasure of one hundred millions in dia
monds, waiting for his fate. So Sardanapalus sat i:i
Nineveh while Assyria, mistress of the world, rotted
* ' with that disease of imperialism known
as retribution, guarding his treasures, spoil
wrung from the weak.
In the Transvaal there is prayer and in England
mourning widespread. The Queen, whose character
in the^e last days is becoming the single hold of Eng
:pnn the pood will of the just, sobs in her palace.
The Prime Minister, whose ancestor was add-
- re in those lines of high ascription.
"Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury," hrÂ»ws his
leonine front in humiliation that lie surrendered to
the greedy ex-Mayor of Birmingham and let his
country forget justice. The subject peoples of the
British empire feel a thrill which they mistake for a
disease, so long have their necks been calloused by
the hard heel of the conqueror. But it is the rising
health of manhood long suppressed.
Around the wide frontiers of the empire rises the
â 'g ambitions, and if it break the dyke
and pour a roaring flood of the world's hatred which
will leave no dry land on which the ark of Empire
may rest England will get a lesson destructive to
her and admonitory to her imitators.
Certain members of the Board of Education are
interesting the public by calling one another hard
names. They have been fair enough thus far not to
accuse themselves of distorting the truth in their
opinions of their own unworth.
OUR EASTERN ALLIES
N- the fact that the pro
pOMd reciprocity treaty with Prance and
Jamaica and the probable extension of freedom
of trade in our markets to Porto Rico and the Phil
ippines as well as to Hawaii are more threatening to
the industries of California than to those of other
sections of the Union, we shall not have to fight the
battle alone. A sufficient number of Eastern interests
are involved to arouse attention in that section to
the menace ahead, and accordingly we will have
strong allies in the contest before us.
Co-operation has been more extensively practiced
in the Kast than with ns, and in this emergency has
been resoned to promptly by Eastern beet sugar
irowera. producers of rice, tobacco Â»nd semi-tropical
fruits. At a rrcent meeting in Omaha to consider
the situation Mr Herbert Myrkk pointed out that
"it might be possible for American farmers to raise
Â«ugar beets in competition with the coolie labor of the
tropics if our farmers were content to live on the
scale of the coolies," and he went on to say if the
issue were fairly presented to the American people
THE SAN FRANCTBCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER IT, 1899.
"not i per cent of the voters will favor any such
prostitution of American agriculture and manufac
tures for the benefit of colonial syndicates."
The New York Press in commenting upon the re
ciprocity treaties has taken strong ground against
them in favor of American agriculture. It argues
â vith sound logic that there is no more reason why
we should abandon protection to rural industries in
the interests of trade than to our manufacturing in
terests for the same purpose. It charges that the ad
mission of the products of the tropic islands to our
markets free of duty would be the "greatest victory
for free trade since George M. Dallas as Vice Presi
dent gave the casting vote for the Walker tariff."
Pursuing the subject the Press says: "It is for the
farmer to decide, and for every kind of farmer,
1 whether he is to be the 'forgotten man.' It is not
only the beet sugar farmer, nor even the tobacco and
fruit farmer, who is threatened. If these reciprocity
treaties are ratified with Britain's tropical colonies
others will follow with her temperate colonies, Canada
â  first of all. Therein the wool, barley, hay, hop and
dairy farmer from Maine to Washington State will
find something of interest. Our Manchester school
has arrived. Pennsylvania is incubating her Cobden.
â¢ One potent influence behind these recommendations
is the selfish, short-sighted American manufacturer,
who would sacrifice American agriculture as British
agriculture was ruined to extend his trade among
peoples xithout one-tenth of the per capita consump
tion of the population he was impoverishing. Now
is the time, when this new agricultural industry Ik
threatened with destruction, for the American farmer
to say, 'Protection for none or protection for all.'
Let Samson only touch the pillars in the sight of
the Philistines. The hint will be enough."
With William Jennings Bryan denounced as ingrate
in Nebraska and Grover Cleveland condemned as no
Democrat in the House of Representatives it begins
to look as if a new and revised definition of Democ
racy might be in order.
IT srfnis settled that the Quay campaign is over.
The Senate stands upon a constitutional precedent,
made when framers of the constitution were Sen
ators, and construed the instrument they had made.
We believe this decision is right, and we hold that
belief without reflecting upon any personality. To
recognize the right of appointment in a Governor
after failure to elect by a Legislature would take
the election of a Senator one remove further away
from the people.
As long as our popular institutions have a consti

THE TfiXfITION OF COUNTY fIND
MUNICIPAL BONDS
ONE of the gratifying features of the convention
of the League of California Municipalities was
the unanimous vote given in favor of the reso
lutions introduced by Mayor Phelan and supported by
Mayor Eaton of Los Angeles urging the voters to
cast their ballots at the next election ior the consti
tutional amendment exempting from taxes all bonds
issued by the State or by any county or city in the
State.
The resolutions tersely express some of the objec
to taxing such bonds in the statement, "The
-man of the tax simply results in preventing
our citizens and savings banks from holding these
- issued at low rates of interest, and compels
their sale outside of the State, which is a needles.
lit upon <>ur resources; it is illopic.il and un
productive of revenue for the State to tax its own
indebtedness."
The evils resulting from the taxation of such bonds
can be easily and clearly perceived by any one who
will give the subject due consideration. In the first
place the imposition of a tax upon the bonds lowers
to that extent their value as investments and accord
ingly the i ity or county which issues them has to pay
an additional rate of interest to offset the tax, or, if
the rate of interest b e fixed, then the premium to be
tied for the bonds in operi market will be less
ened. In that way the burden of the tax falls upon
the community issuing the bonds and diminishes the
value of its loan.
In the second place, as the*e bonds are issued at
low rates of interest any tax upon them seriously
affects the net income derived from them, provided
the tax be paid. If the bonds are purchased by our
â¢avings banks or by other parties in the State who
will make an 'honest return of them to the tax As
sessors the tax will of course be collected, but if
held by parties outside of the State it is comparatively
easy to conceal them, so that the tax is evaded. Thus
there is an advantage to the outside buyer over the
home capitalist, and that advantage counts for so
much that most of our county and city bondi are in
the hands of outsiders.
By reason of the transfer of the bonds to holders
residing abroad a double evil results. The State no:
only loses the tax which it has vainly sought to im
pose upon them, but it also loses the interest, for the
annual payments have to be sent to the holders who
reside outside of California. These interest payment*
amount in the aggregate to' a considerable sum every
year, and the loss of that amount of money from the
channels of local trade it severely felt.
Thus it will be seen that in our efforts to impose a
tax upon our city and county honds we not only put
a burden upon our public enterprises, but we lose the
advantage of the bonds as investments for our b^nki
and also the interest and eventually the principal. In
short, as the resolutions of the League of Municipali
ties declare, "it is illogical and unproductive of rev
enue for a State to tax its own indebtedness." It is
safe to say we derive almost no revenue from the tax
which works us so much harm and compels the ship
ment from the State annually of so much money for
interest. A campaign of education can hardly be
needed upon an issue so plain as this, and yet the
league has done well in urging the matter upon the
attention of the people. It is one which should be
kept in view from now until election day. so that th
vote for the amendment may be assured in its favor.

Kentucky's new Governor through the timely appear

roars and flashes for a week without any attention. Accidents such as that which befell the steam
ship Paris on the Manacle Rocks are made impossible by the invention of this electric siren.
OTTAWA. Canada.â biggest, nols- ,
lost and most useful danger signal I
ever devised ha* Just been adopted
by the Dominion Government, and
the first of these safeguards against dis
astrous wrecks is to be erected at Van
couver harbor, B. C. The device Is a com
bination of the principle of the electrically
vibrated diaphragm, with two huge mega
phones, each of which emits a deafening
roar alternately, giving forth a sound that
can be heard for miles around. In con
nection with the roar of ilia huge elec
tric siren there is a flashlight that can
be seen far out to sea. The whole
mechanism la worked by clockwork, the
light flashing out for forty seconds and
the siren's roar being heard for the re
maining twenty seconds of the minute.
Once wound up the signal does its
work for a week without attention other
than a visit every other day or so to oil
the machinery and make sure that every
thing la In order. The Inventor of the ap
paratus, which Is regarded as an absolute
preventer of accidents through ships run
ning on the rocks In a fog or through the
mistaking of signal lights, Is A. G. Tru
deau of Ottawa.
PANHANDIE EXTENSION.
[The Call does not hold Itself responsible (or
the opinions published In this column, but pre
sents them for whatever value they may have
as communications of general Interest.]
Editor Th- Callâ Dear Sir: I indorse the
paramount recesslty of beginning the es
tablishment of parks before that of
any other Improvement. With an exten
sive park system, especially of a some
what mountainous nature, pedestrlanlsm
will be encouraged and the results will be
better health and leÃs hospitals, i-o
plquantly stated by Mr. Phelan. Parks
are great educational factors and with
plenty of them surrounding us we will
likely have less jails and less drinking
houses; lay, even our churche* might be
filled better, as "th* heavens relate '.he
glory of our God."
The part cf this peninsula known as the
San Miguel Hancho Just abounds with
naturally adapted sites for a Greater
Golden Gat* Park and would form one
continuity from its present southern
boundary down to Rocky Canyon, up to
Glen Park, Including the Sutro forests.
Twin Peaks and the proposed Saltwater
Lake or reservoir for flushing sewers, ex
tinguishing fires, sprinkling of streets,
etc. The acquisition and utilization of
these lands will not necessitate the de
struction of valuable property, as they
are at present not built upon and princi
pally mere cow pastures.
This proposed extended system of parks
geographically runs parallel with the
city and consequently is highly accesslDle
in its entirety. The .portion known as
Rocky Canyon could be formed into a ;
veritable Yosemite in miniature. From the
top of the dam locking the proposed salt
water reservoir a magnificent waterfall
could be had by merely overflowing It,
and in turn might be used for generating
power.. Trees planted on these so-called
Mission Hills would likely protect a large
portion of our city from the severity of
our summer winds.
Now coming to the Panhandle question,
A DIAGRAM OF MODERN COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE. _ Ll â¢
ThÂ« massive apparatus Is the outcome
of a long line of patient and persevering
experimentation, and bears on the. face
of it and in ii.Â» hugeness strong evidence
of the Inventor's confldence In the utility
of what he had in view. Every user of
the telephone is familiar with the be
havior of the 'phone If it happens to be
"off the hook" and the distant ringer is
put in motion. The diaphragm of the
phone la subjected to a series of alter
nating current impulses, and manifests
the effect of these by giving out a clat
tering noise not unlike the automatic elec
tric buzzers sometimes used In place of
the ordinary vibratory call bell. This ob
served behavior of the 'phone under such
conditions has been obviously enough sug
gestive of the construction of a call sys
tem comprising just such parts, but In
practice the Idea has not taken hold hith
erto, perhaps because of the different ele
ments going to make up the system not
having befn given proper shape to fill the
requirements.
Starting his experiments with this Idea
the Inventor of the great siren attached a
dynamo to a sound-producer, and with a
monster megaphone to scatter the vibra
tions through the atmosphere he. turned
on the current and found that he could
produce a roar that would make the king
I deem it unwise, using: the mildest term,
to spend so many millions for the destruc
tion of property when the result Â»â¢ ems to
look so doubt and this In full view of
bo many more other Improvements that
have to be attended to. The money ex
pended for a greater park, as outline*!
above, would be mostly for labor of all
kind, which item ought to be the greatest
point In any public improvement. This
proposition is consequently far superior to
the adoption of thÂ»j Van Ness avenue
panhandle, the execution of which might
probably lead to the loss of many a
present resident of this city that likely
might %o to Oakland or elsewhere to set
tle.
I fully indorse the proposition In an ar
ticle in your valuable paper last Thurs
day by C. <;. MtnMe. favoring the exten
sion of Market street straight over the
hills to the ocean. It could be even done
In a deflected line, obtaining an easier
grate, or perhaps in a bee-line for a few
blocks and then in a deflected line a- waa
proposed years ago and recommended by
the Board of Supervisors it tho time. Re
flecting upon the Bteop grades to over
come on Oak street on the line of the
proposed Van â avenue panhandle. It
is even popsible to turn at the Junction
of Market and 'astro streets into Seven
teenth street. The steep grades of the lat
ter could possibly be somewhat moderat
ed; any way there seems to be hardly any
difference with the grades on Oak street.
Seventeenth street has been the original
outlet from the Mission to the ocean by
way of Corbett road, and from it can like
ly be had an outlet by way of Eureka
street Into Ocean road and further along
Bellevue street, through Rocky Canyon
toward Sunnyside and San Jose road.
The outcome of this project would be
the establishment of an extensive system
of panoramic drives that certainly might
make this city famous, because the natu
ral resources to consummate this Idea ex
ist. To further Improve these natural
park lands would not necessitate great
expenses, as the work could proceed from
time. to time and not spend all on one
particular spot.
Judging from the brilliant results from
our present park, the she of which orijrl
nally was a vast sand dune, we could ex
, of the forest creep to his lair In affright.
, By an Increase or decrease of the pulsa
tions of the dynamo It was found that tho
roaring could be regulated so as to suit
conditions of weather or location, and all
that remained then was to construct th->
apparatus according to requirements.
The one Just made has a tog horn fif
teen feet in length. When the complete
current Is turned on the terrible blast that
bursts from the gaping mouths of thÂ»Â»
twin megaphones can bÂ« heard above thÂ»
noise of a gale, and on a moderately
frtormy day It shatters the air so thor
oughly that no skipper could fail to hear
Its terrific voice at a safe distance from
danger. By the addition of the electric
flashlight, to give warning to eyes wher
ears : rove deaf, the proximity of a vessel
to the rocks will be disclosed In any kmi
of weather and In darkness as well as
djiyllght.
The Dominion Government Intends to
use the new danger signals on points of
rocks where bell buoys are Inadequate be
cause of their comparatively feeble sound*
being drowned In the no!** of waters on

Governor, having authority to appoint -i
Senator to till a vacancy caused by
death, resignation, disqualification or < x
pulsion, had also full power to appoint
. in the event that the Legislature failed in
its duty to elect. He held that the failure
of the Legislature to perform Its duty
ought not and could not operate to the:
State's disadvantage In the Senate.
Attorney General Elkin was followed by
Hampton L. Carson. As he was about to
bf^ln hi? argument Senator Penr of
Pennsylvania Interrupted to Inquire:
â¢â¢I >â¢â¢ "you not pear herÂ« as the paid at
torney of John wanamal
Carson replied that he did not appear In
the pay of Wanamaker or In that of any
body else.
Former Senator Edmunds then seized
the opportunity to disclaim for himself
1 any connection with Wanamaker in the
case.
Carson presented an elaborate legal and
I constitutional argument against the seat
ing of Quay. He maintained it was im
portant that each State's representation
should be kept full, but he regarded it as
equally Important that the Senators from
the several States should be selected
properly and in accordance with the con
stitution. He doubt* the desirability of
according to thÂ« State executive such
authority as was exercised by the Gov
ernor of Pennsylvania in this case, to ap
point anybody to the Senate whom be
might choose. He urged the committee
and the Senate, in considering the case in
i hand, to follow the well-established pre
cedents of the Senate In not recognizing
the right of the Governor to appoint
where an opportunity lad been afforded
the legislature to elect, which it did not
embrace. .I-.
Carson concluded hi i argument with the
declaration that the Legislature of Penn
sylvania hatl actually been prevented per-
I forming its duties of electing a Senator by
the Governor of the State, and that it was
I the tlrst ,nr..' in the history of Pennsyl
vania mat the power of the executive had j
I been exercised in that manner.
Former Senator Edmunds followed Car
son, elaborating some of the legal and
constitutional polntH made by his col
league. He declared the. authority to
make appointments was constantly be
ing Intrenched upon by the executive
power, not only of th*Â» States, but of the
nation Itself. The President was exercls-
I Ing such power by making recess appoint
ments of men who previously had been re
jected by the Senate. This he regarded .is
I dangerous, and urged the Senate to take a
tlrm stand against such usurpation of
power .is a protection to Itself.
Edmunds maintained that, the vacancy
I having occurred during the session of the
I Legislature and that after the vacancy !
i had occurred the Legislature had endeav
ored but failed to elect, the Governor was
barred from exercising his constitutional
right to appoint. He contended that the
case of Quay did not fall within the
authority conferred upon a Governor to
till a vacancy In the State's representa
tion in the Senate.
Attorney General : kin closed the hear
liib with an argument In rebuttal of the
statement! and arguments advanced by
Edmunds and Carson. In conclusion
Klkln held that the Judgment of the Gov
ernor as to the calling of an extra i â
â ton of the Legislature which had failed
to elect a Senator was final and conclu
sive, and that he therefore had lull
authority to exercise his constitutional
right to appoint. In order that the Stale's
representation should be complete.

Arline and the Devil.
Arllne Uardlno. the younger daughter
of Mr. and lira. H. W. Eiardii Is a very
quirt person, but she has a philosophical
and deeply inquiring mii Also, she is
especially attracted to all subjects of re
ligion.
One day. when she was four years old.
she Inquired of her father concerning the
personality of the devil. She had never
been taught anything of his â¢ ntanlc maj
esty by her mother, and certain infor
mation from outside quarters came as
news to her. Her father, bein â¢ possessed
1 by a spirit of mischief, wickedness, or
orthodoxy, pave Arllne a straight, ortho
dox description of Lucifer, tall, cloven
hoofs, sulphurous Fmell and tall, and fin
ished with the remark: "You'd better
take can* and be pood, or you may see
him." Arllne listened, made a note, and
Inwardly digested.
For the next week the region where Sa
tan is suppled to live was to pay In the
house. Arllne told "tarradlddles" like
, anything:. She played with the tire. She
ran away. She deliberately cribbed
things. There was no let tip. Finally.
Saturday night came, and Arline's mather
sat in tears. She had labored with her
daughter with voice, prayer and slippeh.
and Arline lay unrepentant on a bed In
the next room. To her came her father.
"Arllne '* said he. "what's -the meaning
of this? "What has come over you this

A New Process for Pictures.
An association has been formed In <;*>r
many called "The Union of Friends of
-Art for the Ofli.ial Publication of the
Royal National QaUertes." As its name
implies, the society Is the vehicle for dis
tributing among the educational and rÂ»-
Instltutli tis of Germany and the
people in general fac-simlle copies In
colors of toe great maaterpiecei and
famous paintings In the royal galleries; In
Europe, thus planting the seeds of art
education in th<* minds of the rising gen
eration. The society enjoys (treat popu
larity, ard Success has crowned Us Â»f-
Tiie superiority of the prints ts
due in the main to the peculiar process
which the society owns and which Is em
ployed by it alone. In time It will ho in
troduced In the Inlted States. It differs
In Its method from any heretofore em
ployed, as It enables the reproduce. g
artists not only to create true fac
similes of originals by means of pho
tography and steel etching, but also to
produce the depth of color and peculiari
ties of each master. The process, while
an intricate ai.d costly one, is not patent
ed, but the details nre krpt a strict se
cret After the original paintings have
been photographed with the aid of special
cameras and plates, the photographs are
transferred to steel plates, the surface of
which by some peculiar treatment has
been prepared to receive the Impressions
from the negative.. The outline is thus
obtained upon the steel with great exac
titude. The colors, as true to the original
painting in thÂ« distribution of light an 1
ehade as manipulation of the brushes of
eminent artists can make them, hav<Â»
been reprodu. ed on the photographic
copy first obtained and the complex colir
;>ict'ire thus obtained 1s transferred to as
many lithographic stones as there are*
colors represented In the picture, from
which Impression* are taken on presses
worked by hand. The greatest care Is
u=*d in the < hoicÂ«Â» of subjects for repro
duction.âSelf mine American.
A unique violin has been made by a
Missouri man. The back is of cherry
from a tal>lo more than a century old,
which formerly belonged to the Howard-
Payne College. In the center of the back
are Inserted twenty-ono pletos of wood
from the Holy Land, one being from a
grapevine that grew in the Garden of
Qethsemane. Around the margin are sot
in a row small pieces of wood, diamond
shaped, gathered from all over the civil
ised world. In one end of the back Is
inst-rtc-J a horseshoe made of castor wood
and ln the other end is the Image of a
rabbit carved ln cherry. There are In all
over ISO pieces of wood, and the only tools
used in the manufacture of the instru
ment were a pocket knife and a half-Inch
chisel.
COULD'NT RESIST THE COLORS
Squaw Traded Mary Baskets for a
Fancy Petticoat.
One of the great attractions for visit
ors to North Beach of late is a camp of
plxty-:lve Indians, who are located on the
cranberry marsh back of llwaco, with the
olij.ot of engaging in gathering the ber
\\ hile waiting fur the b.-rncs to
ripen they are amusing themselves in ca
tering to the popular fad of collecting In
dian baskets. These baskets ranee In
price from 50 cents to V>. The Indians
receive many a dollar from visitors to
the beach ln exchange for these baskets,
and occasionally exchange them for sec
ond-hand clothln'- when these suit their
fsney.
A few days ago two Portland wonv :. at
the beach made up a large collection of
their cast-off apparel and went to the
Indian camp intending to trade for a lot
of naskets. Their shrewd aboriginal sis
ters, seeing the large amount of clothing
brought, decided that the market was
overstocked and refused to exchange ex
cept on the most extortionate terms, de
manding a wardrobe for a whole family
in exchange for a very common basket.
Consequently there was no rush of busi
ness and the visitors Strolled about. ( Â»ne
of them In crossing a wel place held
up her dress, displming a portion of a
petticoat brilliant with stripes of scarlet
and green. One of the oldest and ugliest
squaws catching a glimpse of this gor
geous gonfalon at once fell ln love with
it nnd offereu to exchange baskets for
it. From the very liberal offer made the
owner of the petticoat at once saw that
the ancient dame was infatuated with it,
and, : :;nÂ»thing of a trader her
self, refus.-.] to part with the garment till
ii whole collection of baskets was offer
ed for It. Then she dotd the bargain,
and. stepping behind a clump
touched t; and her petticoat lay
on the grou:;il I uklng like a heap of
rainbows. The women retdrn^d to th-'ir
cottage well pleased with their trade.â

TIME TO CHECK
RAID ON THE
CITY TREASURY
Illegal Payment to
Deputy Assessors.
POLL TAX COLLECTIONS
ATTENTION OF SUPERVISORS
CALLED TO THE SCANDAL.
Assessor Dodge Gets a Fat Commis
sion for Work and* Pays His
Collectors From Public
Funds.
During the last municipal election cam
paign attention was several times direct
ed to the fact that the Assessor was re
ceiving a fat commission for the collection
of poll taxea for the State while deputies
drawing compensation for the city were
performing the duty of collection. The
Call believed that the tax payers had Just
cause for complaint against the Assessor.
It believed then that Mayor Phelan and
the Supervisors should have taltwu
prompt Btepe to compel the Assessor to
return to the city treasury money so
drawn out to pay poll tax deputies. Per
haps some of the tax payers fancied that
The 'ail's main purpose waa to defeat
Washington Dodge's re-election, but the
paper was simply doing its duty in expos
ing a public wrong. The wrong has not
yet been righted. The Assessor baa not
yet paid into the treasury the amount that
he should pay.
Since the election Auditor Wells and
Mayor Phelan have been advised of the
public outrage. The Auditor did "hang
â  up" some warrants for a few days to
' await enjoinment, but as no injunction
j proceedings were Instituted the demands
' on thÂ« treasury were cashed. The Mayor
\ has promised to look Into the matter and
perhaps the tax payers may obtain Justice
without thÂ« trouble of calling a mass
i meeting or the expense of appealing to
the courts. The commission of 15 per
cent received by the A.-f .-!- is big pay
in fact, double payâ and the Inclination to
j grab more is swinish, to say the least.
The matter Is fully explained by J. C.
Saulmann in the following communica
| tion to the Board of Supervisor*:
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisors of !
the Cliy and County of Han Francisco â Gentle
men: The undersigned, a cltlztrn. elector and i
taxpayer of this city and county respectfully i
begs ieÂ»ve to call jour attention to certain 11
Â»â >â¢*! <Â»; e:.'l!:i:r< - from the city and county
treasury, Â«â :.:..:::.â¢ -1 and encouraged by the
Assessor, Dr. \Va&h!iu;ton Dodge, aggregating
U:\v.-:i '."â â ".} 4ii4 Â»-â -*; dollars. Said expendi
ture* cuiiiibt In the payment of monthly sal
aries drawn from the public treasury to divers ;
jviM.--i.ti engaged in the exclusive occupation of
collecting poll taxes .-in.- tho first Monday in
March or the current ear. Section IM2 of the
Political Code alluwb the Asse&gor - commis
sion of 15 per cent as compensation for serv- j
ices rendered In the collection of poll taxes,
and the Supreme Court of this State has dc- |
cided in the ca-se of San Luis Ã¼bispo County .
vs. J. M. Felts et al. UO4 Cai.. p. â¢Â»)) In an
action brought by the county agaln.il the As
sessor and his sureties to recover the cmount
of certain percentages on personal property
tax--, road and "poll taxes" claimed and with
held by him as hits legal compensation for mak
ing these collections as follows: "We do not
see In c-ither auction 12 of Article XIII or sec
tion 6 of article IX of the constitution any
thing which clearly deprives the Legislature
of the power to make the poll taxes pay the
expense of the collection. It Is fair and reason
able and Just that they thnuld l>Â« charged with
euch expense, and the fact that they are ex
clusively a State tax Mikes It peculiarly ap
propriate that the atenia for their collection
should be compensated by a perc*:ua*;# of their
collection rather than out of the salury of gen
eral funds of the counties. LtÂ«?Â»ldes the cases
in which it has been held that it is only just
that ever}' tax should bear the necessary ex
penses of Its collection the ca*e of Sliaver vs.
Robinson (M Ala. P.ept. p. US) is directly In
point end clearly sustains the validity of this
law.
In an interview held some time since between
the Ahsebj- r and the undersigned, in which the ;
attention of the former was called. \o the ille
gality of paying these poll-t,19 collectors
monthly salaries from the city and county
treasury rather than cut of the commlsÃlor.e.
as the law and the decision of the court clearly '
imply, the At-.Â«essor sets up the somewhat novel
anl nbburd plea that hÂ« had simply followed
In the foctste;* of his predecessors, which plea
was easily LruÂ«he.d aside by the Supreme Court
In the caÂ«e cf the County of Modoc vs. Spencer
(103 Cai . p. <9>). in which the pies was set up
tlmt what was done there had been done by
Hoards of Supervisors In other count to
which the court responded . - follows: "Many ,
acts done by boards and officers In the supposed
discharge of their duty, and In the best of
faith, do not find sanction In the law. and for a j
time pats current because unchallenged: but
that fact cannot weigh In favor of their valid
ity when eventually called Into question. The
action of the board, being without authority,
waa void and created no legal claim against
the county. No claim against a county can be i
, allowed unless It Is |. iu'.!y chargeable to the !
county." The books of the Auditor show that
the Assessor has collected between the first
Mon.-lay In March and the last day of Novem
ber the sum total of J?â¬.375 in State poll taxes.
and l.aa retained as ills commissions on same
aii'i personal perquisites of his ofJlce the sum
of Ji4.41>6 2J. or thereabouts. The undersigned
on November 1'? tiled a protest with the Auditor
against the payment of certain poll-tax col
lectors for the same month, but, for the want
of time In which to perfect Injunction proceed
ings the mutter was allowed to go by default.
On December 1 he had the pleasure of a abort
Interview with Ma Honor, the Mayor. In which
I he complained to him of the illegal action of
the Assessor. Upon the personal request of his
Honor, the undersigned communicated hi*
views in writing, on the day following, receiv
ing an trance from him that lie would give
this matter his serious attention.
The undersigned would recpectfully suggest
that this matter be Immediately referred to
your Finance Committee, a committee by law
invested with authority to compel the attend
i ance of witnesses, to Fend for persons and pa
peri, etc., etc , and that later on ]e -a,i pro
ceedings be instituted by the city to recover
from the Assessor and his bondsman the
amount claimed to be Illegally drawn from the
public treasury.
In order to show the wasteful extravagance
of the Assessor It is only necessary to soy that
durlr.g the months of July, August, September
and October he collected the sum of IMSO In
jk>ll taxes, of which he retained as his commis
sion the sum of JS37. The expenses to the city
for collecting this amount of State taxes, pure
and elmele. was as for as can be as
certained without Investigation about J1&50.
all i all out In salaries, and the
benefit accruing to the city by this
transaction will be about $I*4o. equivalent to
about 22 per rent, that being this city's per
centage of the State school fund. Rather a
costly enterprise to be engaged In. this pay-
Ing of 33 r>er cent out Of the city treasury lor
the collection of State taxes and receiving but
22 per cent In return. If the Assessor had col
lected no poll taxes at all between July and
October the city would be Just SS'jO richer. For
the month of November a still more ludicrous
ftaten-.er.t is furnished. The collections amount
ed to tS#| on which he received In commis
sion? 1143 35, leaving a net balance of $': 6." to
bÂ« covered into the State treasury. The cost
In the city for llectlns the same amounts to
about S<oo In salaries, which is in excess of iO .
per cent on the sum total collected. Ruin and
bankruptcy were sure to stare any merchant In
the fac who attempted to do business after
such a fashion. The undersigned hud tb<T pleas
ure laPt year during the latter part of October
of exposing In The Dally Call a similar annual
mid on the city treasury a raid sequent up
on the. mnking up of the military roll by the
Tax Collector, upon which roll he found the
names of hundreds of dead men and of nearly
all the lame and the blind and the halt and
the leprous and the misshapen and those ex
empt by law from military service, and which
net* the Tax Collector nearly I2.VW In addition
to his comfortable salary, and he now asks
you to stop this annual p-ill tax raid and to re
cover what has V>en ken from the public
treasury contrary to law.
Any information in his posse^slnn which will
lead to such recovery will be furnished cheer
fully and with alacrity, and the books of the
Assessor will show who collected poll taxes
between March and December. The undersigned
Is credibly Informed that for want of funds one
officer of the city has been compelled to pur
chase corj for hi* office at his own <>xpeni-Â«Â»;
that the City and County Attorney has had to
purchase office stationery with his private
funds, and that the Janitors of the City Hail
are without brooms to sweep the corridors an.l
without soap to scrub the name, thereby vividly
recalling the condition of things existing in the
famous Augean stables before Hercules ac
quired control of the waterworks and other
public utilities, while the Assessor Is literally
rolling In wealth.
It Is respectfully suggested that the sum of
Jjrsoo taken from the treasury contrary to law
would be mor<! than sufficient to purchase all .
the Incidentals heretofore mentioned and leave
a generous surplus.
In conclusion the undersisned desires to say
that there 'â¢ absolutely no reason why the pub-
I lie treasury of Pan Francisco should pay for the
collection of this tax, and the books used In
â uch collections, when, aa a rr.atter of clear
anl c Id law. every other Assessor In the State,
save possibly one outside of this city and coun
ty, is compelled to pay for the collection out
of his 11 per cent commission, and when, as a
matter of fact and of law. the remainder of the
tax. to wit. the- 80 per cent, is paid into the
iry. The delinquent poll-tax col

P. S.â Attention Is also called to the case
of the Public Administrator, who receives no
compensation whatever from the public treas
ury, but solely commissions on all estates ad
ministered on by him, such commissions being
fixed by law, and who usually has an attorney
and from one to two clerks, the latter of whom
he Is compelled to pay out of his commis
sions.
And to the decision of the Supreme Court In
the case of San Joaquln County vs. Jones (see
IS Cai., p. 3:7), Jones having been a County
Treasurer, who claimed the ?um of JI3C6 7f in
salary from the country treasury, allowed by
the Board of Supervisors of the county, al
though the general law allowed treasurers "a
percentage only" on the -urns received by
them at compensation for official services. In
which thÂ» court held that "The Legislature
itself flxi'i the compensation, which was de
signed, 'dcuttless to comprehend the full
amount t.> bf raid to thnt officer.'
"The Legislature having by general law fixed
the compensation of County. Treasurers at a
certain percentage on moneys received by them.
Boards of Supervisors have fco power to allow
such Treasurers' salary out of county funds,
unless specially authorised by law." In the
cafe of Henry Dalton. the Assessor of Alameda
County, the Plate Controller decided about Oo
tober 1 that the Assessor of that County Is no
longer entitled to the IS per cent commission
on poll taxes collected by him, the county
government act of 1537 having provided him
with two salaried deputies for the collection
of such tax. In lieu of his commissions.

W. A. BOOLE & SON.
Leading Shipwright Firm of the
Pacific Coast.
AmonÂ£_the shipwright firms whose op
erations in the past quarter of a century
have assisted In making San Francisco
one of the principal maritime ports In the
world, none stands higher than that of
William A. Boole & Son at 219 Steuart
street. The senior member of the firm
has been In the business for over forty
years and his name Is familiar to mas
ters and owners In all parts of the world.
The business of the firm was established
by Mr. Hoole In IS6I.
In l^r'} tie came to California, at that
time the Mecca of thousands of gold-seek
ers. Mr. Boole's ventures in the mines
proving unsuccessful he returned to San
Francisco ard worked for a time at ship
building, constructing some of the largest
ships and four-masted schooners on the
coast.
In 1593 his former partner retired and
waa succeeded by W. A. Boole Jr. It was
not until the early part of the present
year that th*> firm name was chanted to
William A. Boole & Son. Mr. Boole Jr.
Is a valuable ally to his father, the result
being a careful administration of tne
tlrm's affairs. By hard work and care
ful attention to details the business of
the â¢m has steadily Increased. During
the Spanish-American and Philippine wars
the IJoolos had considerable work In nt
ting up the troopships and their excellent
service was specially commended by the
Government officials. The products of
their skill as shipwrights are visible In
every known sea. Personally the Boolea
are very popular with their employes and
associates.

A â¢ SOUND INSTITUTION.
The Bonk of California One of the
Leading Financial Concerns
of the Pacific Coast.
The Bank of California, one of the i
strongest financial concerns In the United i
States, was Incorporated in April, ISG4,
by D. O. Mills and William C. Ralston,
with a capital stock of $3,0"0,000. Two
years later the f-tock was increased to
55,000,000, but In 18il. owinjr to unfavorable
legislation. It was reduced to the original
figures, at which It stands to-day.
The history of the bank from Its incor
poration to its suspension in August, 1878,
is one of romance ami pathos. In the ex
citing days of the Com.stoc :â !:, the bank did
not scruple to lend as high as $000 on
â¢hares at Comstock stock. The reaction
which Inevitably succeeds inflation re
sulted In disaster, but forty days alter
closing Its doors the bank met every ob
ligation, dollar for dollar. President Mills,
who for the second was at the helm,
resigned his office in April. 1378. and
was succeeded by William Alvord, who
has since that time ably conducted the ;
affairs of the institution.
President Alvord is a banker of experi
ence, and to his conservatism and sound
business sense the success of the bank In
the past twenty years has been princi
pally due. Thomas Brown, who Is asso
ciated with him as cashier, is regarded
as being an authority on finance fn this
State. He has been connected with the
bank since October, IS7O. He Is a man
of sound judgment in whom the stock
holders and depositors repose unlimited
confidence.
The assets of the bank aggregate over
$17,000,000. Its Investments are principally
in stocks and bonds, and its surplus ex
ceeds $3,000,000. The directors of the In
stitution include many of the best known
capitalists In the city and State.

RIPARIAN RIGHTS.
Important Opinion by n Judge of the
Circuit Court.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 16.â Judge E. B. Adams j
has handed down an opinion from the j
bench of the United States Circuit Court
In which he establishes the Important
precedent that questions Involving th->
ownerships of accretions to property along j
navigable rivers are matters for the Fed
eral courts to consider. In the course of
his decision Judge Adams says:
"I have found many easel announcing I
the general doctrine that local laws must â 
determine tho riparian rights of owner*, i
but subject In all cases to primary right
of the United States in navigable waters
for the purposes of commerce."
It Is no dlszrace to work for a living.
but the living some men get for their
work is disgraceful.

LAST OF EUREKA SOCIETY.
r> ITTLE children, most of them looking end anfi worn, some of them
cripples, others apparently hungry, plodded Into Judge- CofTey's court-
L' â  their future homes worn, be determined
'<->â¢'<: court-
Ir future home* I rmined
j. rhy the court. The children were all the late wards of the Eureka
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to children, but If the story of the
offlcrrs of this now extinct society, which is borne out by the children. Is
truo. the walls of the old institution on Twenty-fifth street, near Sanchez,
under the malronship of Mrs. Uattle E. Reed, hid from view and kept from
public knowledge f.rr sÂ«->mÂ«Â» tlnv* nets of cruelty appalling In their nature.
Fourteen of these children, each one of whom it is alleged had â  tale of
cruelty to toll, were In court, but th<* nature of the proceedings, based on
the writ of ha'.Â»Â«-aÂ« corpus. prevented a full Investigation into the merit? of
the charges. Charles Montgomery, president of the late society, took the
stand and nld that thÂ»- institution foundered through cruelty to the children
and complaints occasioned thereby. Children had told him that they had
lÂ»cÂ«-n ill fed, bathed in cold water, beaten before they were dry after the bath
and were ofltimes nlthy and covered with vermin. Others had been forced
to carry beer ;it the instance of Mrs. Heed and her daughter Pearl, while
other* claimed th.it girls had been forced to jump from thÂ«-ir beds at - o'clock
In the morning and prepare hot water for toddies. Judge Coffey would not
allow *!.â¢â¢ Â« K&mlualion to go further, as he said that he did not desire to turn
the court into a platform for a riot. Mrs. John Pettee. who has for years
past Interested herself in behalf of homeless and abused children^ said* that
chr> could prove numerous specific acts of cruelty charged to Mrs. Reid, and
she was called a.< a witness. Before she was asked a question, however.
Judge Coffey said that he could foresee the result if she told her story, and
Mr>. Pettee left the stand. Mrs. Pet tee subsequently said that little Georgia
Rush, a late Inmate of the Eureka Home, but now comfortably located in the
tsan Francisco Home, who iÂ«. a cripple, hail been forced to stand all day in a
closet by Mrs. Reed. The child, his diminutive form bent with. disease and
pain, lisped that the charge was true, but the witnesses were prevented from
telling their *tory. Judge Coffey took the children as their names appeared
on the writ of habeas corpus and disposed of their cases. Louis Delatour, a
rxisht-cyed youngster of 10 years, was given Into the custody of his aunt, who
resides on Church street. Â«"harles and J^rry Jackson went away with their
frit her. Samuel. Sarah, William R. and Minnie Robinson, youngsters ranging
from 5 to 12 years of age. were again awarded to the custody of their
mothen Robert, Edna and Willie liowen went with their parents. Alice
H.lnii n v.-ent across to Oakland to live with her sister, and there remained in
Mrs. Reed's custody Nettie and Jennie Baumgarten and Sisto Orlez. Next
Wednesday the children ttill remaining in Mrs. Read's custody will again ap
pear in court, and if any contest to their disposition Is made by Mrs. Reed the
court said that he would aJlow witnesses to take the stand and prove the
i-harces of cruelty. During the proceedings Mr?. Reed as represented by ex-
Justice of the I'eace Carroll and the Eureka Society, a committee of the
late members appearing as petitioners In the habeas corpus proceedings, re
tained Daniel O'LJrien to prosecute the case on behalf of the unfortunate chil
dren, which resulted in a victory for all but three, who must wait until
Wednesday for f.naJ relief.

PLEASURABLE ANTICIPATION
When Food Is Used in Modexa-

If you are one of those who have
eaten too freely of Crape-Nuts and

help and advice for you.
It Is a concentrated food and the sys-

pmall amount at a time.
If too much is taken nature revolts
against the overloading. lie moderate
and enjoy the food day by day. It is
too valuable to your system and to
your Fturdy health to give over. It is
Â« common fault for people to overeat
randy or any other delicacy at some
time in life and from an excess be
driven to abstinence. Hut with Grape-
Nuts It will richly repay you to start
RCaln on the fix<*d allowance of not
more than three heaping teaspoons for
the cereal part of the meal, and ?o long
as you use the food in moderation you
vill dick to it and look forward to the
ni^al with pleasurable anticipation.
Il'-member Grape-Nuts furnishes the
most delicious tasting cereal food
known, and contains the certain ele-
ments nature usos for repairing and re-
building the brain and gray matter in
the nerve centers. The steady and
moderate user of Grape-Nuts can de-
pend upon daily nourishment of the
kind that pives one that feeling of re-

CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECT HIM
WITH FRIDAY'S FIRE.

Marshal Towe Believes Stone Knows
More About the Conflagration
Than He Would CarÂ© to
Explain.
Â» â
"Colonel" Walter Everett Stone, whose
name has been mentioned In connection
with the origin of the fire that destroyed
the Bush-street Theater, has eluded the
police, and It Is believed that he has got
out of town. Detectives hunted for him
last night, but failed to get a clew that
would, lead to his whereabouts. A story
was circulated that he had left for New
York, where, he told his friends, he had
been called to settle an estate In which
he Is heavily Interested. The 6tatemont
of his departure for the East Is not gen
erally credited, as he waÂ« known to be
practically penniless. There may be
something In the story that he Is inter
ested in the estate, for the police have
learned that Jake Raver has been buying
up several notes that Stone had floated,
and has assured many of the "Colonel's"
creditors that they would be paid In full
If they would be patient. Raver is said
to have looked into Stone's claim that he
was about to inherit a fortune and was
sufficiently satisfied with the prospects to
advance money on the "Colonel's" paper.
Fire Marshal Towe will commence his
Investigation into the cause of the tire
next Monday. He will not directly charge
that Stono is responsible for it. but statea
that all of the surrounding circumstances
point strongly that way.
"He has not led like a man who had
nothing to fear from an Investigation,"
.viid the Fire Marshal last evening 1 .
"When the papers published my sus
picions that he had set Ore to the theater
he would havo come forward and given
Â«n explanation, If he was innocent, in
stead of going Into hiding or fleeing from
the city.
Stone has been living for Fume time in
a little hovel in the rear of 512 Jones
street, but he has not been seen about the
premises since Friday morning. During
yesterday afternoon the police reached
the conclusion that Stono had made away
with himself, and practically gave up
tJioir search for him. They changed their
tactics in the evening, however, and re
doubled their efforts to take him into cus
tody. Detectives Crockett and Dillon are
â working on the case.
It Is not thought that Stone Is very far
away, and the police believe that he will
l>e arrested in some of the towns on tho
other side of the bay, whose officers have

PIXAR'S BROTHER.
Wrecked on the Barbary Coast and
Appeals to Uncle Sam.
A. B. Piiar, representing himself to be
a brother of Gregorlo del P;lar. the Fil
ipino general, told Secret Service Agent
Hazen yesterday a weird story of adven
ture on the Barbary coast.
His tale was to the effect that having
a 20-dollar piece in his pockets and ex
periencing a consuming thirst, he drifted j
Into a dive at the corner of Jackson and I
Kearny streets, where he met some I
strange ladles, who made themselves so
agreeable that he opened three bottles of
alleged wine and succeeded in spending
$13 50.
The bartender, finding that Pllar was a
"good thing." gave him a counterfeit dol
lar and a counterfeit half-dollar In change
and refused to exchange them for good
money.
Pllar wanted thÂ«Â« bartender arrested, but
Mr. Hazcn did not think he could make
out a case, there being no witnesses to
prove that the bad money was actually
passed. Operator Cronln. however, went
to the saloon with Pllar and Induced the
saloon man to give Pllar good money :or
the counterfeit.
Pllar cays that he Is an "Austrian."
He does not believe the report that his !
brother, the general, is dead, and jays
that only a ehort time ago the general
sent $350,000 to his father In Austria for
the purchase of supplies for the Filipino
army.

WEATHER PROPHET PUZZLED.
The Present Storm Has Been Con
trary to All Predictions.
The Weather Bureau thinks that It is :
going: to rnln; In fact, it Is announced that
the conditions are extremely favoraole
for a little spell of dampness. All of the
old stereotyped announcements that the
"tall of the Storm" has just got through
wagging have been relegated to the nsh
pile and will not be used In the future.
It Is admitted that the present storm has
been a poser for the weather predictors,
and they are not prepared to say Just
what Is coming next. It has rained over
the entire Pacific slope and the storm Is
steadily working eastward. The pressure
is falling before It as It goes, although i
It has ris<-n somewhat on the slope. There
Is no indication that the rain has any no
tion of fjultting for the time being.

These Powerful Lights Suspended
Over the Sidewalks in the Shop
ping District Menace All
Persons Passing.
The danger to which pedestrians are ex
posed through the hanging of arc lamps
only a short distance above the sidewalk
was further exemplified yesterday. R. J.
Hancock, a well-known business man,
was the victim and Is congratulating him
self over the fact that he did not receive
the full tremendous force of electricity
with which the wires are charged.
He was standing on Kearny street and
touched, unintentionally, the lower por
tion of an arc lamp with the steel rod of
his umbrella. The circuit was completed
Instantly and he received a shock which
felled him to the ground. He recovered
from the shock quickly, but as a re
minder of his narrow escape from death
there Is a furrow seared In his thumb.
The umbrella he carried had a small
: steel rod. This made a splendid conduc
tor, especially when the sidewalks aro
I damp. As the lamps are hung low on
Market and Kearny streets, the busiest
' part of the shopping district, pedestsians
I should avoid them. The lamps are sup
posed to be well Insulated to protect per
pons who may come in contact with them
from injury.
This is i he second accident of this char
acter since Thursday. T. A. Bel fridge, a
marine engineer, was the tirsi to call at
tention to the danger. In a communica
tion to the Supervisors lje reported a case
which came under his observation and
asked the board to amend the lire or
dinance regulating the distance of f.rc
and other Hectrie light lamps and wires
from the sidewalk.
"1 was looking in a Shop window en
Kearny street, near Post, when the acci
dent occurred," said Mr. Hancock last
night. "As I turned to move away I law
two ladles of my acquaintance and sautedaut
ed them. As I put my hand to my hat I
felt a blow in the middle of my back as
though â  in'- terrific force had struck mo
there. I was knocked to the sidewalk
on all fours and for a moment was dazed.
I could not understand what was the mut
ter with me for a moment, my ilrst haity
impression being that a house lad fallen
on me.
"Persons Mmo to my assistance at once
and I soon had only a scar on my left
thumb to show where th* electric fluid
had burned a seam in my flesh. I belic-vft
I had a narrow escape from death and
do not want to repeat the experience."

GRADE LESS THAN THAT OF
MANY STEAM RAILROADS
Picturesque Solution of Panhandle Grade Problem.
MAYOR PHELAX'S reply to the "impossible grade'"
obstructionists of the panhandle extension is very
forcibly substantiated by the plans and opinions
of expert engineers. Scientific inquiry proves that
from i he pcenic point of view It is for better that
there arc grades to be overcome than that the panhandle
extension should bo constructed along ground entirely
level. It gives opportunity for many pretty features and
permits of an almost level drive. At no place need the
grade <x. â¢â¢.â .! 5.7 per cent, which is considerably ms than
that of the steam road that runs from Central avenue to
tho park.
Charles H. Holcomb. the civil engineer and surveyor,
who was invited to give his ideas before the annual meet
ing of the Iroquols Club, has surveyed the ground and
prepared a report with diagrams. It shows that with
only attractive viaducts the drive along tho panhandle
Is eminently practicable and con be made singularly
beautiful. Mr. Holcomb's report says:
"The extension of Golden Gate Park from Baker
street to Van NoÂ«s avenue and Market street will be
proof that our people have at last awakened from their
plumber and that our thoughtful and far-seeing citizens
are putting their shoulders to : he wheel with the object
of giving this city a future.
"A few Silurians who have always opposed all matters
-' a progressive nature, differing from their old forty
nine school and Ideas, ure again attempting to raise their
voice against popular sentiment, and in opposition to our
advancement some of them claim that the extension of
the GoMen Gate Park -to Market street and Vnn Ness
avenue Is not feasible, that it Is Impracticable. This ar
gument will not stand Investigation. I have prepared
plans of the proposed extension and applied a 3.7 per cent
grade. I have examined carefully the official grades of
the ground over which this extension would pass and
find that it Is not only feasible but that one of the finest
drives in this Western country could be constructed over
the proposed route. The grade from Baker street to a
point about 2SO feet westerly from Stelner street could

be made practically level, though it would not be advis
able to make it so. as an easy grade would be preferabje.
From this point with stretches of i-traiKht and curving
I!nc3 easterly to Van Ness avenue and Market street it
could be constructed upon a 3 por cont grade, which
horses could trot down rapidly with perfect safety. it
Is tho descent and not the ascont that should be consid
ered in constructing a boulevard or pleasure drive. The
majority of accidents on public drives tako place going
down the grade, and, an I have slated, a horse can trot
down a 3 per cent grade with perfect safety. Yet it Is
not necessary to hold to a 3 per cent grade; a 4 or 4U per
cent grade for short distances would work no injury to â 
pleasure drive.
"It has been claimed that a drive could not be con
structed over this ground without an excessive cut from
Pierce to Webster street.
"I find that In constructing the 3 per cent grade to
which I have referred the greatest cut would be thirty
four feet find that the averaue cut would be eighteen
feet for a distance of about I.W) feet, ngalnst the total
distance of the proposed extension, which is 6157 SS-100 feet.
The fill in the vicinity of Beott, lÂ»ev!sadero. Lacuna and
Octavla streets would be very light, averacing about six
teen feet, which would affect the ground only where the
main drive would pass, giving the proposed "park along
the line of the fill a gentle Slope from the lines of Oak
and Fell streets to the driveway at the rate of about six
to one. The bridges or viaducts over which the drive
would pass In crossing these streets would cover only that
space necessary for the park drive, from fifty to eighty
feet In width.
Pierce street would have an entrance on Oak and
Fell streets over a grade of about 6 per cent. Flllmore,
Ptelner and Webster streets would pass over the park
drive on a bridge or viaduct, which would add materially
to the beauty and attractiveness of the proposed park
and drive, as well as the Immediate neighborhood.
Where a cut would have to be made the slopes on
either Fide of the drive could bo constructed with a
gentle rise from the driveway to Oak or Fell street by a
nominal Increase In cost of construction, considering the
Increase of beauty and benefit derived.

Shorter Railroad Line.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 16.â The necessary
documents have been signed by the South

known as the Chatsworth Park cut-off
between here and Santa Barbara. The
road will run through Susannah Pass,
piercing the mountains with a tunnel 500
feet longer than the one at San Fernando
The latter will be abandoned when the
new road Is completed. Work will begin
ln.Bix weeks, as soon as the fill at Somls
is completed. This will enable trains to
| run to San Francisco in ten hours and to
Santa Barbara in two hours. This short

FOR WELL PEOPLE.
An Easy Way to Keep Well.
It Is easy to keep well if we would only
observe each day a few simple rules of
health.
The all Important thing Is to keep the
stomach right, and to do this It its not
necessary to diet or to follow â  set rule
or bill of fare. Such pampering simply
makes a capricious appetite and a feeling
that certain favorite articles of food must
, be avoided.
Professor Wicchold gives pretty good
advice on this subject. He says: "I am
G8 in old and have never had a se-
rious illness, and at the name time 1 my
life has been largely an Indoor one, but
1 early difoovcred that the way to keep
healthy was to keep a healthy stomach
not by eating bran crackers or dieting of
any port; on the contrary, 1 always eat
what my appetite craves, hut for the past
eight years 1 have â¢â  adÂ« it a dally prac-
tice to take one or two of Stuart a Dys-
pepsia Tablets after each meal and I at-
tribute my robust health for a man of
my age to the regular dally use of Stu-
art's Tablets.
â¢'.My physti first advised me to use
them because he said they were perfectly
harmless and were not a secret patent
medicine, but contained only the natural
digestives, peptones and diastase, .nd af-
ter us>ing them a few weeks I have never
ceased to thank him for his advice.
"1 honestly believe the habit of taking
Stuart* Dyspepsia Tablets after meals is
the real health habit, because their use
brines health to the sick and ailing and
preserves health to the well nd strong"
Men and women past 50 years of ago
need a safe digestive after meals to in-
sure a perfect digestion and to ward off
disease, and the safest, best known and
most widely used Is Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets.
They are found in every well regulated
household from Maine to California and
in Great Britain and Australia are ran-
idly pushing their way into popular fa-
vor.
All druggists Bell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, full sized packages at 50 cents
and for a Weak stomach a SO-cent pack-
age will often do fifty dollars' worth of
good. 1- :-*: -* :<: <

Daughter of Ingalls Dies.
ATCIIISON. Kans., Dec. 16.-Mrs. R. P.
Shlck. daughter of ex-United States Sen
ator John J. Ingalls, died suddenly at her
home at Reading. Pa., last night. Mrs.
Stuck was the second daughter of Mr. In
gallÃ. She was In an Episcopal deaconess
school when she met Mr. Shick, a manu
facturer of Reading, to whom she was
married In April last. She has been in
poor health lately. It is not believed Mr.
Ingalls' health will permit his coming
home to attend the funeral, which will
take place in this cUy next Tuesday. Mr.
Ingalls went to LAS Cruees, N. Mex.. last

started for Tucson. Ariz. His exact

in nrtm whom Miss Irving can In no way

In "One Summer's Day" Mr. Drew had
s>ore opportunity for the display of those

POLLAK-VIRAG RAPID TELEGRAPH INVENTION.
Hi description of the way Messrs. Pollak and Vlrag accomplish
their very remarkable work:
The metnl drum over which the perforated tape D Is passed Is
Fhown at the left of ttgure 2. The perforations In the tape permit the
brushes PP to come in contact with the drum and thus complete the circuit.
Kach perforation, as It passes under the steel brushes. causes the circuit to be
closed and to be opened again as It passes on. The current, following the di
rection of the arrows, passes to the telephone receiver K. The mirror T. which
Is fastened to the diaphragm of the telephone, dances as the diaphragm Is vl
rrated by tho Impulses. The cut A In tlgure 3 shows an electric Hunt bulb F. and
Us ruys of light striking the mirror T. and being reflected In a beam to the drum
H. on which Is the sensitized paper which receives the message photographi
cally by recording the movement of the light beam as the mirror causes It to
â¢lance. At D In ligure 3 Ik Fhown the perforated tape. The upper row of holes
rÂ« presents "dashes" and the lower row of holes represents "dots" as used in
the Morse code. Figure 1 shows the manner in which the message Is written on
the photograph film. The angles pointing upward represent "dashes" and the
angles pointing downward represent "dots." The horizontal lines connecting Jhe
angles are the spaces between words and letters.

According to reports. Pollak and Vlrag made experimental testa In New
York in sending dispatches between that city and Chicago and succeeded In
transmitting signals consisting of letters of the alphabet at the rate of 60.000 an
hour. To achieve that feat It was necessary to use an electric current of 76
volts, and genuine messages were not transmitted because of the amount of
Induction to be overcome and the Interference and Interruptions with the wire,
Further experiments were madÂ© in Chicago, first between that city and Mil
waukee and afterward with Buffalo. In those tests real marvels were accom
plished, In the first experiments messages were dispatched at the rate of 122.
Â©O3 words, an hour. Then wires were obtained to Buffalo and back, making a cir
cuit of 10C2 miles, and over that distance messages were sent at the rate of 90.
000 words an hour. when, owing to the excessive voltage, there came a blur In
the receiver which stopped further experiments for the time. Over a short
loop messages were pent, beginning slowly, but gradually Increasing in speed
until they were run up to the rate of 140.000 words an hour.
Borne Idea of this phenomenal Improvement in telegraphy may be had to
the layman when It Is said that 2000 words an hour under the regular key trans
mission Is a very good rate.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1899.
She has done It merely In a sentimental
mood of pity for the chivalrous, tender
hearted husband. But. of course, the
wife misunderstands It. This Is one of
the pimple things which cause the inter
esting action of this very interesting
play. The plot is simplicity Itself, but
It Is acted with puch skill and has such
clever dialogue that the spectator is ab
sorbed. All the actors concerned portray
their parts with discretion and ease.
John Drew's polish and ease, his dig
nity and finish have never l>een more
manifest than In this representation of
the tender-hearted husband who has been
so easily ruled by the quiet tyranny of
tears, but who asserts his rights to Jus
tice In the end. The climax of the second
art. Â«rben the wife leaves home for her
father's house. Is remarkably well worked
up. and in her acting here Miss Irving Is
at her best. The third act shows with
especial significance Mr. Drew's adrolt
nd refinement. His delivery of his
lines Is marked by the clearness, the dis
tinct enunciation, the cultured modula
tions to which we are accustomed. He Is
an actor of authority and charm. His
style Is llnlshed. polished, perfect In train
ing and breeding. He shows his lllus
trfoua ancestry In a thousand attractive
ways. Mr. Drew deserves all the success
he has had since he left the Daly com
pany and began his career as an Inde
pendent star. He haa shone with bril
liancy and radiance these eight years.
and each year seems to strengthen his
hold upon the esteem of the public. His
appeal Is to the cultured, the refined, the
loven of true and of noble art. The long
run of "The Tyranny of Tears" at the
Empire Theater la a tribute to his per
sonal popularity as well as to the interest
of Haddon Chambers' play. When he
leaves New York Mr. Drew will bo
missed, but the country at large win en-
Joy seeing him; and then next year, when
be comes again, thenâ then he will receive
a welcome befitting his rank In the world
of art.

When I call "The Song of the Bword" a
melodrama, it Is in its strictly scientific
serifce. that is. It Is a play in which situa
tion rather than the development of char
acter Is the prominent characteristic. The
ordinary melodrama, bo called, violates
probability at every turn. Its emotions
are conventional and commonplace; its
b. ntinunt Is flimsy, with a constant apptal
to the gallery. Not so with the play In
which Mr. Sothern Is now appearing at
Daly's Theater. It is a romantic drama
In Its best sense. The story is coherent
and probable; the characters are natural
as well as pleading. There is "atmos
phere." plcturesqueness, vigorous action.
Impassioned dialogue. The costumes and
make-up of the actors are rich and con
vincing. Praise must especially be given
to the appearance of Norman Parr, who
looks like Napoleon, acts like him and
speaks as we imagine Napoleon would
have spoken. It is the General Bonaparte
of the Italian campaign of 1796, with his
thin, spare figure, his long black locks,
his nervous gestures, his austere expres
sion, that Is here represented; and Mr.
Parr looks as if he had stepped out of an
old picture. The part which General
Bonaparte plays is not particularly to his
hor.'.r. Of course, It Is not historical, and
a<- h not pretend to be.
Mr. Sothern is a "ci devant." OneÂ© a
Marquis, he has taken Rides with the rev
olution, and Is now a captain In the army.
The scone Is laid in Italy, on the eve of
the battle of Lodl and a few hours after
the bridge has been crossed.
Virginia liarned Is an Italian Countess
whose sympathies are not with the
French. The first act takes place in a but
near the Countess' castle. The Countess
Is disguised as a peasant girl. Captain
EgaJite 'Mr. Sothern) rescues her from
one of his soldiers, suspects her disguise,
but conceals It under an assumed
badinage. When he chances to leave the
stage, she learns from the man to whom
â he is betrothed that he has important
dispatches to deliver to the Austrian
general. But when he learns that the
roads are tilled with French soldiers he
it afraid to start on his dangerous
errand. Thereupon the Countess re
proaches him with cowardice and de
termines to carry the dispatches herself.
This furnishes the motive of the play.
The plot hinges on the Countess' effort
to carry out her resolve; upon Captain
Egallte's pursuit of her; upon her fail
ure; upon her being seen by Bonaparte,
who Is captivated by her beauty and ani
mated by the desire to win her; upon the
FAMOUS MINES
IN SOUTH AFRICA
Cold Reefs That Pay
Millions.
â¦
Now that the war with South Africa Is
well under way, the story of the gold
mines which have led to the conflict 1b of
the greatest Interest. More fortunes have
been made In South Africa of late years
than In almost any other corner of the
world, and the mines are still rich enough
to make hundreds of millionaires before
they are exhausted.
It sounds like romance to say that the
English soldiers are now fighting on fields
of gold, yet It is mere sober reality. There
Is gold enough in the mines already
worked to pay off the whole national debt
of England, and nobody can say what the
future may bring forth. It is quite within
the bounds of possibility that at any mo
ment a gold mine may be discovered
which will surpass In wealth any that ha*
yet been known. Already South Africa Is
the second greatest gold producing coun
try In the world, and what it may bÂ« be
fore the next century opens It is impos
sible to foretell. Its wealth may be beyond
the most amazing dreams of avarice. Six
Inches of soil on any Transvaal battlefield
may hide such wealth in gold and dia
monds as the world has never dreamed of.
The mines of South Africa cover many
miles, and give work to between 60,000 and
70,000 men. The famous Wltwatersrand
mines, nearly the richest In the world, are
In a gold basin which extends for 130
miles, and In less than a dozen miles of
this reef there is said- to be gold worth
$2,000,000,000.
The first man to make his fortune In
South Africa did not become a millionaire,
but he became immensely rich In less time
than it takes to read this article. Thirty
years ago a Hottentot child was found
playing with a bright pebble, which to
day is In the possession of an English
countess, who purchased It for $125,000.
That was the first fortune to be made In
South Africa, and since that time it has
been Impossible to keep pace with the gi
gantic fortunes which men have built up
In that part of the world.
Barney I'.arnato made moro money In
the Transvaal than he could count. He
had barely enough money to pay his hotel
bill when he set foot for the first time
In the country, but at the end of three.
years he had sold some mines tor $575,000,
having made money at the rate of $200,000
a year, and from that time his wealth
grew amazingly. In one day the public
subscription* to four of his companies
were more than seven million and a half
dollars, and he became the first South
African millionaire.
The De Beers mine pays dividends at
the rate of $15 a minute all the year
around, and the huge fortunes It has
made for Its owners run Into many mil
lions.
J. R. Robinson, a youth of 19. happen
ing to be In the country when gold was
discovered, established himself at once
and bougnt what proved to be the richest
tract of land in the Witwatersrand dis
trict. For $35,000 he purchased the Land
laagte estate, the richest gold producing
area of its size in the whole world.
There is still sold In Kimberley a fac
simile of the check for $27,500,000 paid by
the De Beers Company for the assets of
the owners of the Kimberley diamond
mine, and it serves to remind us of the
tremendous figures in which South
African money makers deal. The wages
paid by the various companies run Into
considerably over $20,000,000 every year,
and In diamonds alone the exports have
been over $500,000,000 in the last thirty
years.
The four De Beers mines are 112 arres
In extent, and in one year three million
loads of "blue ground were taken out.
It Is a strange Fight to pee the Kaillr
workmen r.i work with their pickaxes,
loosening this hard, blue ground, piling
It upon Narrows ana wheeling It away
into the open fields. Here Is Is left in the
rain for menths to be subjected to
natural decomposition before being s*nt
to the mills. From the three million
loads taken up by the De Beers work
men In one year diamonds worth $17,500,
000 were extracted at a cost of $7,500,000.
How long will the gold mines last?

captain's defense of her even at the risk
of court-martial: and upon the final solv
ing of all the difficulties, and the brave
Countess and the noble captain loving
earh other and being forever happy.
Tho court-martial scene Is a triumph
of stage management- It Is remarkably
effective and plctureseque. The stage Is
crowded with French soldiers In their
striking uniforms. The scene ends with
a battle which could scarcely be sur
passed on the stage.
The captain, who has been condemned
to death because he has allowed the
Countess to escape order to save her
from Bonaparteâ has been permitted to
lead a forlorn hope. Before he has a
chance to leave the Inn In which the trial
has taken place he Is attacked by the
Austrians and In a desperate struggle is
overpowered and taken prisoner. The
Countess meanwhile has returned to her
home. She finds that trie Austrlans are
to make It their headquarters. Of course
Captain ERallte Is brought there as a
prisoner. She obtains his release. In this
last act Miss Harned shows as artistic
and convincing acting as she has ever
shown In her career. Her pleading for
vindication from the distrust of her lover
Is a beautiful piece of work from first to
last. Miss Harned's lovely voice lends
Itself to tenderness, to love, to womanly
dignity, to all the charm which such a
scene demands.
Mr. Bothern Is most skillful In the scene
where he simulates partial Intoxication
and the gradual clearing of his faculties
at the time of stress and danger. His
role is not the equal of that he has as
D'Artagnan. It does not furnish him with
such opportunities for the display of those
qualities which have made him such a
favorite with the public. He has had sev
eral plays which show him to more ad
vantage. This Is not detracting from his
work In 'The Song of the Sword," but
merely to emphasize what he has done
In the past. Ho is a romantic actor of
rare ability, with much magnetism and
dash and fervor. He has much humor,
too. and when he dlplays It he Is sure to
please even more than in his tender love
scenes. And that Is saying a good" deal,
for as a stage lover Mr. Sothern has won
many enthusiastic comments. The suc
cess of his revival of "The King's Mus
keteer" delayed so long the production of
"The Song of the Sword" that It Is not
likely Mr. Sothern will produce "The
Sunken Bell," which he has been rehears
ing. That charming fantasy which Agnes
Sorma and her associates produced at the
Irving Place Theater ought to suit Mr.
Sothern, Miss Harned and their admira
ble company. In German "The Sunken
Bell" was very successful.
Daly's Theater has remained un
changedâdecorations, curtain (with tm
monogram "A.D." still upon it), the uni
forms of the ushers and gatekeeper and
so on. Only the foyer looks bare because
of the removal of the superb portraits
which graced Its walls and made it a
bower of beauty. One especially misses
seeing Ada Rehan's portrait as Kather-
Inc. And several times as I watched the
Sotherns and their company In "The Song
of the Sword" I had visions of a door at
the left opening and issuing from It that
superb and radiant Kathenne in her dark
red velvet, or Lady Teazle In her flower
ed gown, or the glorious Portia, or the
sweet and gentle Viola, or the blithesome
Rosalind, or the vivacious Mrs. Ford. Ah.
when will New York see Ada Rehan once
more? May the Fates. speed the day!

MUCH DISTRESS
AT CARBONADO
Widows and Children

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Dec. 16â Reports from Car
bonado state that great distress prevails
among the sixteen widows, forty-five or
phans and six old people who were de
pendent for support on the thirty-one
minors killed In last Baturday's mine dis
aster. Their Immediate needs are being
provided for, but their future looks very
dark.
The miners had nothing saved up and
carried no insurance. They lived In the
company*! houses and bought everything
at the company's store. At the end of
tarn month they had nothing left. Now
the widows are confronted with the knowl
edge that they must move out of the
company's houses at once unless they can
get to work and earn rent money. To
do this will be hard for the sixteen
widows, most of whom have several chil

offers of assistance, having devoted Its

Owens returned to-day from Carbonado.
He is non-corr.mittal regarding the cause

Wonderful if True.
According to the testimony of * Mil
waukee gypsy, who was In New York re

one of the Vandcibllts. Aators or Rocke
felers, but a simon-pure gypsy, whone
name Is simply John Smith. He lives In
Mexico, is SO years old and the owner of
countless acres, myriads of cattle and
sheep, of gold, silver and onyx mines, of
railway and bank stock and of plantations
without number In the heart of Mexico's
richest States, says the New York Tele

John Smith has no Fettled home; h? has
a hundred homes on his different estates
and he moves from one to another. In
each he sees what Is going on and fives
his orocrs. Then he moves on again. The

They become great friends.
"No one knows how rich I am." said
Smith, simply, "but I think I am the rich
est man on the continent."
Sni.th was plainly dressed in a suit of
English tweed, with hobnail shoes. But
his home was a revelation. Outside It was
a veritable fortress, with stout walls of
masonry, loopholed for defense if neces
sary. A two-story wall Inclosed it in a
space as big as two blocks, and a great
moat surrounded that. There were the
regulation drawbridges and portcullises.
Two massive inner doors barred the last
entrance. Once open it was a wonderful
place, with a courtyard In the center,
where played perfumed fountains and
where a beautiful garden grew. The entire
inclosure was paved with brilliantly pol
ished onyxâ the ransom of a king In cost
taken from one of his mines. Even the
stable where Smith's herd of pet Jerseys
wara housed, hail the sama costly floor-,
ing of onyx. Servants lounged about, but
one of the old man's eccentricities was to
v'i c hls own cn i l( lren wait upon him at

to see him clattering around on the s>i>l< n

bmlth is an English gypsy. He went to
Mexico before there were any railways
there and was the first man to haulÂ«na

which now yield him an Incalculable In
come. He got in on the ground floor on
everything that has made Mexico so rich
to-day. Hut his life has been a series of
adventures. Twice he has been shot down
by Mexican thieves, who attacked his gold
trains. He was left f..r dead each time.
All the gypsies In Mexico ar. wonderfully
proud of him and call him "Our John."

have to have anything but a bit of pocket
money, and It Is a fact that many a ship
goes out on a voyage with hardly a dollar
on board. If the captain needs anything
he can either draw money at any port he
enters or else find credit there.
"It was vÂ«ry different a generation ago.
In those days a captain had to t ik.> out
with him money enough to last him for
the whole voyage, and â OBMthll -
emergencies besides. He oft. n l.a-1 Â»>!<

"It was not uncommon in those days
for a ship to start out with a full
bound for some foreign port, where the
captain would have to hunt his own mar
ket. If thÂ«s cargo wouldn't sell well there
he had powef to go to any other port to
hunt a profitable market. Then when he
had sold out he was expected to buy n>-w
cargo, either for a home port Of perhaps
some other part of the world. It was not
unusual for a captain to handle half a
dozen cargoes on a long trading v
and come nome In ballast, with a>;.
of silver dollars to help keep his ship up
to the wind. Kven the little vesst;
rled a lot of money abo;trd.
"I guÂ«ss that dollar was wrecked there

SAYS NO ONE FEARS DEATH.
Experienced Physician Tells of a
Popular Fallacy.
"I have seen thousands of persons die
under all sorts of circumstances, and
never yet have I seen one display thÂ»Â»
slightest fear of death " This remarkable
statement was made the other day by a
f>hysician who has practiced many years
n Philadelphia and who has seen a great
deal of hospital service.
"It Is a popular fallacy," he went on,
"to Imagine that a deathbed scene Is ever
terrible, other than as a parting between
loved ones. The fear of the unknown in
never present at the last. Even amid Ig
norance and vice I have never experienced
such scene* as a novelist who strive.-) after
realism will sometimes picture.
"When a patient is told that he cannot
recover and the end Is near, he Invariably
seems resigned to his fate and his only
thought seems to be of those who ar* to
be left behind. This Is true alike of men
and women.
"Those who become hysterical and de
clare they are not fit to die are the MMi
who are not so ill as they think they are.
Those always get well.
"A psychological reason? Oh. I don't
know that there Is any. It's Just a human
trait."â Philadelphia Record.

GENERAL CRONJE
AS A FIGHTER
Way He Handled the
Jameson Raid.
While Joubert 1b th* cunning schemer
of the Transvaal army. Cronje is it*
rough and burly renter. Of the two he
la the more representative Boer. Joubert,
possibly from his French ancestry, is a
man of a certain polish, and can be In
direct when policy re^uir.-*. Cronje I*
blunt and always to the point. His craft
is that of the hunter, and thinly disguise*
the force that awaits only the oppor
tunity.
Something of this Is already observable
In his operations around Mafeklng. ll*
Is doing all he can to lure Baden-Powell
from the Intrcnchments. where he can
strike man for man. He his mad.- sev
eral assaults. He can bo depended upon
to stake everything on one desperate
light at the first fair chance.
General C'ronje is greatly admired by
the Boers. They think Jouben la a won
derful tactician and organizer, but they
love Cronje. the silent man, of sudden and
violent action. Me is no man's friend
His steel gray eyes peer out from under
huge, bushy brown. He never speaks
unless necessary, and then In the fewest
words. He never asks a favor. WhÂ«-n
time for action comes he acts, and that
with the force of fate and with no con
sideration for himself or his men.
That Is the way he handled the Jame
son raid. He saved the republic then. in
the opinion of the republic. lie Is a man
after the Boer's own heart.
Cronje Is a soldier and nothing else. Ha
hates form. He hates politics, though a
born leader of men. He was strongly
urged to oppose Kruger for the Presi
dency In 1533. but he would not. He will
have none of any rule but that of thÂ»
rifle. He despises cities. He Is a man of
the veldt.
These two men. Joubert and Cronje.
hold in their hands the fate of thÂ»< Boer
republics. The one Is commander In chief,
the other Is second In command. Of Jou
bert wo have heard much, of Cronjo lit
tle. The most descriptive . picture of
Cronje Is from the pen of Dottglas Story,
the editor of the late Boer newspaper. thÂ«
Standard and Diggers* News. It was pub
lished In the London Dally Mall of Octo
ber 30. and the following Is an extract:
"Wily and farsecing as I" Plet Joubert.
no man of them all can handle troops In
the field as Cronje. He has the eye of a
hawk for position, the nose of a Jackal
for signs of weakness In an enemy. His
maneuvering of Jameson was that of on
Oliver Cromwell.
"Cronje was commandant at PotehÂ»f
stroom, seventy miles to the south of
Krugersdorp, when Jameson crossed Ike
border. Ho co-operated with Malan and
Potgieter, but the conduct of the fight
lav with the cool head of Cronje.
â¢'I rode out to the scene of Jameson's
defeat some time after the battle. and
realized how much of the hunter there Is
still in the Boer righting man. No mer>Â»
soldier would have herded his enemy so
patiently into a position as did Cronje
Into the fatal corral at Doornkop.
"All through the night succeeding
Jameson's attack on Krugersdorp Cronja
kept warily hustling his enemy Into the
place of death. The brave, foodie**
troopers, heavy with sleep, were urlven
like sheep into a shambles.
"When the morning broke, to the right,
to the left and in front of them Boer
marksmen kept their rifles trained upon
the raiders. Escape there was none. But
the battle was won in the night hours,
while Jameson was helplessly blundering
on In front of his remorseless enemy
CronJ.* could afTord to wait until the
troopers came within a hundred yards be
fore he gave the mercy blow.
"And yet there was â  time in the dark
ness when Jameson almost escaped from
his hunters. Cronje's son was badly
woun'Jed In the early skirmish. For th*Â»
moment the father's Instinct overcame
the general's discrotlon. He bore his boy
back to Krugersdorp and left him with
Dr. VHJoen there. It was a father's act.
and one strangely unlike the rough farm
er's exterior of the man who mastered
Sir John WiUoughby.
"Tho lesson learned that pitiful night
dictated Cronje's courteous assurance to
the defender of felling that the Red
Cross was safe from him and his.
"While Cronie was gone somebody
blundered; and the troopers In their
blindness very nearly wandered round the
flank of the boaters Into safety. But It
was not to bo, and long ere daylight
Crcnje was bnck to repair damage and ar
rance his* final battle.
"That drizzly, misty night made Cronja
a Mar god among tho Boers.
"And yet these stolid veldt men give
little demonstration of their admiration.
The Boers are not â  grateful nation a.Â»
the Americans with their Dewey or wa
British with our Kitchener are grateful.
Days after the battle I saw Cronje riding
heavily down the Kerk r-traat In Pre
toria, a heavy big-boned peasant upon a
shaggy, trlrpllng pony. No man touched
his hat to him. few accosted him.
"And yet It Is significant that Cronje.
among the Boers, Is always known as
'Commandant' Cronje. There Is a rude
dignity about the man that compel so
much of respect. Other men are known
by their Christian names. 'Slim Plet' Jou
bert. 'Oom Chrlstlaan* Joubert, 'Oom
Jan* Hofmeyerâ occasional, but rarely
nowadays, *Oom Paul* Krugor. In a
place apart stands 'Commandant' Crooje.
"80 far as my memory carries. CronJ*
was not even specifically thanked by the-
Volksraad for his great services to the
state at Doornkop. He was a burgher:
It was his duty to repel the Invader. he
repelled himâ and there the matter rested.
"They would have censured him had he
failed: they refrained from comment
when he succeeded.
"Camje. riding back to Pretoria, had no
guard of honor to receive him. no great
civic function to fete him. no sword of
honor to adorn him. He was plain Pea*
ant Cronje. returning, heavy hearted,
from his wounded son's pallet In Knigers
dorp Hospital, somewhat weary In th*Â»
bones from those long hours In the steam-
Ing saddle, nowise elated, nowise altered
from his everyday demeanor.
"Since then Cronjo has received a seat
In the Executive Council, and Is now a
personage with a substantial state salary:
but the man Is no way changed. He was
thought to be a supporter of the Presi
dent's when he Joined the Executive
Council, but neither Kniger nor Joubert
has found him amenable. He ia not of
the race that makes the party man.
"He is as Individual an Kruger. strong
In the faith of his own generalship as
Joubert."

DESERVES IT.
Remarkable Success of a New Treat-
ment for Piles.
For many years it haa been supposed
that the only absolutely sure cure for
piles was by surgical operation, but the
danger to life and tho pain and expense
have been so great that many thousands
suffer for years rather than submit to this
last resort; or they seek the temporary
relief In the many remedies claimed to
relieve piles and rectal troubles, salves
ointments, and similar simple remedies
which give only slight and very tempo-
rary relief.
A new preparation which Is painless and
harmless, but which affords Immediate
relief and in many <:a*-s a complete cure
In a very short time, is sold by druggists
under the name of Pyramid Pile Cure.
It is in suppository form used at night
and Its regular use has cured thousands
of obstinate, long standing cases, and It
seems to be equally effective In all the
various form* of piles, whether Itching
bleeding or protruding. "
The Pyramid Pile Cure allays the In-
flammation and Intolerable Itching, re-
duces the tumors, and Its astringent prop-
erties cause the enlarged blood vessels to
contract to a normal, healthy condition.
A Baltimore gentleman relates his ex-
perience with the Pyramid Pile Cure In
these words:
'It affords me unusual pleasure to add
my Indorsement to those of others relative
to your really wonderful pile remedy. I
was a sufferer for years until told by a
fellow salesman of the Pyramid Pile Cure,
It has entirely cured me and I cheerfully
send this for publication if you wish to
use It In that direction. I wish you would
send me one of your little books on cause
and cure of piles. I desire to show it to
some friends."
Any pile sufferer may use the Pyramid
with certainty that It will give Instant
relief and regular us* a permanent cure
and the still further certainty that it con-
tains DO cocaine, morphine or metallic or
mineral poison.
All druggists sell Pyramid Pllo Cure. 50
cents for lull sized treatment.

STRONG FIGHT
MADE AGAINST
LOWER FARES
Officials Address the
Supervisors.
SAY WAGES WILL BE REDUCED
GRIPMEN AND CONDUCTORS
MAKE A STRONG PLEA.
San Mateo. Sutter and Union Street
Lines Represented â Delegation
of Employes Wait on the
Mayor.
Th* Judiciary Committee of the Board
Of Supervisors h*ld a long session yester
day morning to hear the arguments of
representatives and employes of several
â  ' fir i''jmpar.li's aKrunat the passage
of the propoÃed ordinances reducing fares
to eeven for 25 cents to workmen and
eight for 25 centÂ«; to school children during
â¢ hour 6of the day. The Market
'â â "â¢' ' :;'any was the only one which
did not appear, though one >â : its employes
was present to Jon In a strong plea made
by several cor.<i I :..nnen, in
which the was requested not to
recommend the pa: snpe of the orders, on
the ground that they would suffer a loss
in wages If fares were reduced.
Secretary ' Clayton of the San Mateo
road made an emphatic protest against
the adoption of the orders.
"Our company." said Mr. Clayton, "can
not Stand this contemplated reduction of
fares without a corresponding decrease In
the wages of our motormen and conduct
ors. The present rate of 5 cents is not
exorbitant, and I am confident that the
75 cents a month which it is intended to
save to the laboring men by the proposed
reduction would not be accepted by them
if they knew that the streetcar employes
would suffer by the change-. No other
country in the world ha* a better or
cheaper streetcar service than this, anil
the uniform rate of 5 cents a fare 1b a
better fare both In the interest of the In
dividual and the community than a Sl-;S 1 -;
cent fare. Wo give a--= much and more for
5 cents than any other city, considering
the Increased cost on rolling stock, rails
and operating expenses.
"The proposition to Bell eight tickets
for 26 cents to school children between
5 and 17 years of age will make It hard
for the conductors to distinguish as to
whether a passenger is entitled to the
advantages of the age limit. Many will
seek to enjoy the privilege who are not
entitled to it and I am sure that If a con
ductor should happen to put a passenger
off whom he thought was older than 17
that a suit for d 1:: .... would result. In
which we would be the losers. Women
would delay their shopping in order to
go home between the hours of 6 and 7
in the evening and pay the lower rate
of fare whereas only workingmen are
supposed to benefit thereby.
"If the lower fares are put in effect we
would be compelled to abolish the transfer
agret'm^nt now existing between the Mar
ket-Street Railway and our company, for
we could not give It 24 centfl and carry
the passenger for the other cent. If the
transfer system Is abolished It means ;ui
extra fare or great Inconvenience to the
public."
Chairman Byington In reply read of the
conditions now prevailing in Toronto,
Canada, where twenty-live tickets ar*
sold for $1 to the public, eight for 25 cent.i
to workingmen and ten for 25 cents to
school children and >â¢â¢â¢: pays a net reve
nue to the city of $140.0 Â» year. He
contended that a lesser rate stimulated
trafllc and increased the car company's
receipts.
To this Mr. Clayton replied: "By that
method of reasoning the more people we
carry at less than cost (for it costs us
.0379 ;o carry each passenger) for four
hours during the day the more money we
make. Therefore we would make more
if we carried them for six or ten hours
a day. Give us the same conditions as
prevail In Toronto, such as no taxes to
pay, as the system there is owned by
the government, less paid for wages, less
for coal, rails, etc., and we can give you
a 3-cent ire.
Secretary Stevens of the Sutter-street
line stated that his road paid 5 per cent
on a legitimate capital and that if that
return were reduced by the lowering of
fares the stockholders would certainly
t.ike some action to recoup themselves.
He was not prepared to state that wages
would be reduced on his line, but thought
It probable.
GÂ«?<iig.> Newhall. president of the Unicn-
Btreet line, asked the committee to pro
tect the r.tockholders of a road that were
composed lr. the main of widows and or
phans. The roÂ»d had paid as high as 4tt
cents to carry each passenger and in 1 '.'T
5 5-103 cents. Fifty per cent of the gross
receipts went to the employes and their
wages would certainly have to be reduced
If fares were lowered. It might force the
company to charge '.'. cents on the horhe
car system and an additional 3 cents on
the efible system, each of which s oper
ated under different franchises, thus mak
ing the fare 6 cents instead of 5, as it is
now.
"lf we do this what can wo exoect of
the Market-street Company?" said Mr.
ill. "it the orders , ed we

li.wer far^> are to operate. He thought
that If ;h^ revenue of the company were
is It certainly would b<
be and his fellow-workers would be me
â¢ iai : ufferers.
Prank Bell, who haÂ« been with the <*aJ-
L-Btreet line for twenty-one yenrs,
said that there were 5000 men employed on
treel cars and thought that lewer
fare^ would result In reducing salaries
f!.>m S to 40 cents a day, which would
more th.an balance the benefits the lafior-
Ina men wfiiild reap as passengers.
C Wentworth of the Presidio line
thought the orders discriminated against
his craft and was a detriment to railroad
men, who work longer hours than other
laborers.
L,. Whlteman and J. G. Miller spoke In a
Blrallar ntrain and the committee decided
to postpone further consideration until
next Tuesday afternoon, when some rec
ommendation will be made.
After adjournment the delegation of em
ployes waited on Mayor Phelan and re
quested him to veto the orders If adopted
by the Supervisors. The Mayor promised
to pee that the employee of rhe street car
lines should not suffer any hardship and
will make a thorough investigation of the
subject.

Chamber of Commerce and the Board
of Trad* Support the Protest
AguinEt the Use of Timber
for Construction.
The Board of Trade of fan Francisco
and the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce have adopted resolutions asking
the California delegation, in Congress to
aid the Secretary of the Navy and the
Chief of the Bureau of YardÃ and Docks
to change the construction of the new
dock at .Mare Island from timber to con
rj-fi" find ptone. These two bodies em
brace a larjie numter of merchants and
owners of ships and generally represent
the entire commercial community. Some
very striking facts have come to their
knowledge that have led them to act.
are found In part In a recent re
port of Admiral Endlcott. Chief of the
Bureau of Yards and Docks. That report
his made It i tear that the timber docks
are not only very expensive to maintain,
but also :t..it they are unsafe; and that
the repairs upon structures of that kind
take much tlmo and their dlsabkrm-iit, in
time '>: :.(â¢â¢) would amount to a disaster.
cott wrote as follows in
his report: "Timber graving docks of the
ty required by the navy are really
rive temporary (structures, unrelia
ble and unsafe. The masonry graving
n and Norfolk are In serv
ice In the navy after a pt-rlud of sixty
and are in a good, substantial
condition, with almost an insiKnin<-ant
cost for repairs upon the dry dock struct
ure proper since their completion, in con-
Blderatlon of the long time they have been
In service.
"On the other hand the timber docks
have been making very poor records and
this has made it apparent that the tim
ber dock Is not the best, cheapest or
safest for use at Mare Island. For in
stance dry dork No. 3 at the Brooklyn
navy yard, had only Just been accepted
from the contractor when leaks developed
in the entrance works, undermining a
portion of the abutment and threatening
the collapse- of the dock. A battleship,
tho Indiana, was on the dock at that time,
but wns fortunately about ready to come
out. The sum of at least $3,000,000 was
thus hazarded. The cost of the repairs
upon the dork amounted to $170,000 in a
period of eighteen months."
Very similar was the case of timber
dock No. 2 at the same navy yard last
July. During a heavy rainstorm an abut
ment angle gave way and bulged In for
a distance of about fifty feet longitudi
nally. A number of the braces and altar
timbers were broken and a break also
took place In the west Fide of the dock
in the main body. th<Â« altar system bulg
ing inward and forward. This made the
d.i.rk absolutely unsafe until it could be
rebuilt. The repairs cost $300,000. In his
report Admiral Bndlcott had the follow
ing concerning the last mentioned case:
"Here Is an instance where a timber
dock that cost, originally. half a million
dollars, failed bo Blgnally 'â¢ nine years
from the time of- its completion that as
to require rebuilding almost 10 per cent
of its first cost. It had been concluded
to entirely renew the side structure in
concrete and $300,000 are asked for ad
ditional in this report for this purpose."
The admiral recommended, therefore
that the Mare Island dock and also the
dock to be constructed at League Island
should be constructed of stone and con
crete instead of timber, raising the cost
to $1,100,000 In each instance, the law to
be amended to make this possible. Sena

TRY TO HOLD

Mission Footpads at
Work Again.
" REPULSED BY THEIR VICTIM

Captain Gillen Determined to Appre
hend the Pair â Are Sup
posed to Be Ex-
Convicts.
9
The two footpads who have been op
erating In the Mission for the past few
weeks made an unsuccessful attempt to
, hold up a man named Reynolds at an
early hour yesterday morning. Reynolds
was on his way home and when near
Thirteenth and Mission streets he saw
two men standing against a fence on the
opposite side of the street. As soon as
they caught a glimpse of him they dis
carded their headgear and substituted
slouch hats, which were Intended as a dis
guise. After donning masks the men
started to cross the street whore Reynolds
was standing. One of the robbers drew a
revolver and leveling it at Re) no] or
dered him to throw up his hand's.
Realizing that the men meant business
Reynolds quickly obeyed the command In
the meantime calling on the robber who
held the pistol not to shoot. Evidently
thinking that their intended victim was
"easy game." the desperado who pointed
the revolver at him replaced the weapon
In his pocket and at once proceeded to
relieve Reynolds of his valuables. As he
started to search him Reynolds struck the
robber In the face, and as he staggered
back from the effects of the blow his in
tended victim took to his heels and soon
disappeared in the darkness. The pair
made no attempt to follow him, presum
i ably satisfied to allow him to get away
Reynolds lost no time In reaching the
Seventeenth-street station, where he told
Sergeant Perrin of his experience. Per
rin, accompanied by several police officers
visited the scene, but after a lengthy
search they failed to get a trace of the
footpads.
From the description given of the men
by Reynolds Captain Gillen Is satisfied
that they are the robbers who have for
the past several weeks been operating In
the Mission. He has specially detailed
several of his best men in citizens' clothes
to apprehend them.
Last night Reynolds visited police head
quarters and gave an accurate description
of the footpads to Captain of Detectives
Hohen. He li satisfied that he will be
able to Identify them in case they fall into
the hands of the police. The men are said
to be ex-convlcts who were released from
( San Quentln a abort time ago.

A MIXER OF COCKTAILS
BECOMES RUSSIAN COUNT
"MAYOR SUTRO" KRUGER OF PLEASANTON.
FROM the ordinary Rphere of cocktail mixer to the exalted social posi
tion of a Russian Count has been the rapid flight to fortune of H ; K h
Kruger of Pleasanton, Alameda County. Kruger mi as familiar to
the people of the little town as the cocktails he mixed with such dex
terity. No one knew whence he came, and all efforts of the curious to
fathom the secret of his past were unavailing. By reason of his marked re
: â¢ niMance to one of Ban Fran<Mseo's former executive* Kruger was known
throughout the lower part of Alameda County as "Mayor ButTO of Pleas
anton."
For a number of years he was a familiar figure at the Rose Hotel, Pleasan
ton. where he presided over the destinies of the bar Ho received regular
remittances from Russia. A few clays ago he announced to his friends that
hÂ« was about to return to his native land, and in this connection tho secret
of hie life became public.
Kruger is the descendant of Russian nobility. At the age of 30 he fell
in love with a peasant girl. When his father learned of his intention to win|
a woman so far beneath his sorlal station he sent him to America for a
pleasure trip, in the hoj.f that he would forget the object of his affection*
Kruger discarded his family name when he reached thi* country, and tor
thirty years has parsed under his present cognomen. He received r . c;ular
remittances from his people, but refusal to return to his home. Recently
his father died, leaving him the only heir to a vast estate. The Russian
Consul had considerable difficulty in locating the "Count," and had almost
ylven up the search * lien he found him mixing cocktails in a country hotel.

P. J, Stuparich and Joseph

Attorneys Ach and Collins Say Bitter Things
of One Another Over an Eighteen

JOSEPH GASSMANN'. a stockholder
of the Stuparlch Manufacturing
Company, whose business location
is 141-147 Fremont street, was
served with an attachment yester
day afternoon, levied by the Sheriff at the
instance of Mrs Johanna Le Conte. The
Sheriff's levy read for 518.000. a sum
claimed to be due Mrs. La Conte by Jo

latter. This Is but the latest move in a
series of sensational legal processes which
cover a family quarrel and show some

Joseph Gassmann is the. father-in-law
of P. J. Stuparlch. the head of the cor

card business not only of the Western
States, but also China, Japan and the en

over $1,000,000 and is a corporation, ,i minor
portion of the stock of which is held by
Gassmann. It is claimed by the attorney
of the corporation, George D. Collins, and
the members who hold the controlling In

concocted by Gassmann'a attorneys,

was the formal opening of the Holly Park

heartiest of the many the progressive resi
dents of that district have given since
they organized to secure the best the city
affords in the way of municipal improve

Notwithstanding that the primary ob

some time and depend ii]xÂ»n an attempt
or the former to rtgain what he invested
In the buslnesa.
The father-in-law owns a considerable
portion of shares In the corporation, but
not enough to seeur* a voice In In man

The first suit that was Instituted was

SECOND CHAPTER
OF THE SIMPSON

Answer to Simpson's
Complaint.
WHERE THE MONEY WENT
NXJSBAUMER SAYS SIMPSON RE-
CEIVED THOUSANDS.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, Dec. 18.
The second chapter In the Slmpson-Nus
baumer feud was tiled In the records of
I Alameda County to-day when Km.i Nus
baumer filed his answer to EL P. Simp
son's suit for un accounting over his set
tlement In the tangles over the construc
tion of thÂ« Macdonough building in this
. city. The answer asserts that Simpson
! got $3616 so out of the compromise Instead
of the $1116 so claimed, and that ir.o
umount nettled for was 119,000. and not
W.M6 40. us claimed.
After making v lot of statutory denials
the answer tells the story of the compro
mise a* follows, omitting the legal ver
biage:
Un February 20. 1Â»93. A. A. Moore and
, J. C. Martin were the attorneys for Simp
sot, in his litigation with the late Joseph
Macdonough. and th.it they, and not
Simpson, employed Nusbaumer to com
promise with the lknholders against tho
Macdonough building because of the full
ure of Simpson to settle with them. Act-
Ing under this employment, which was
with the consent of Simpson Nusbaumer
worked for eight da>s and secured settle
ments with all of the lien claimants In the
following; sums:
J'uget Sound Lumber Company. Includ
ing the assigned claims of M. Marks F
H. Rov<-nbaum. Pierce â â  Co., J^v V L,

to take tIM.
These :i-,'iires were presented to Kimp

agreed lo pay Simpson the l!.it sum of
JU',OOO, out of Which all of these claims
gating J10,3.53 20. should be paid
leaving a balance of IC'iltJ K>, which was
to be paid to Simpson.
The settlement was made upon this
basis, Joseph Macdonough drawing tne
checks In oil own name for all of thes<'
parties, sending the checks to them and
tinally sending Simpson a check for the
balance due him. Upon the delivery of
these checks all actions were dlsmis-'ed
Judge Nusbaumer then declares that
he never received any money or property
In the settlement except his fee of MiO
The story of Simpson's being left out

ment was made ts s>aJd In the uns-.ver to
have been as follows: "The reuson the
defendant requested plaintiff to remain
outside the oflke of E. R Cole wa* that
defendant believed â â * said Macdonouph
would be present In said office, and know
ing that plaintiff (Slmpsoni was possessed
of a quick and ungovernable temper and
that plaintiff (Simpson) and Macdonough
were unfriendly, one toward the her
he. defendant (Nusbaumer). feared that if
plaintiff and Macdonough met there might
be trouble between them."
Judge Nusbaumer sets up a counter
claim against Simpson for #10 for lncUl-n
tal expense* anda?ks Judgment for that
amount and costs. The document is alei.ed
by Fitzgerald & Abbott and A. L. Frlck
as attorneys for Nusbaumer.
Meanwhile Simpson has served Nuabau

VOLCANO ON ISLAND OF LUZON.
Eruptions of Great Severity Took
Place in 1897.
The most famous volcano In the Philip
pines is the I yon. an<i one ot its moxt
tremendous and destructive outbursts
occurred in 1Â£37. Father Jose Coronas,
desiring to preserve a record of *h&
principal phenomena connected i\ith this
eruption, eecured all the accounts of eye
witnesses that he was able to collect and
has recently brought them together in a
pamphlet published by tho -Manila Ob
servatory.
This volcano Is in the southeast portion
of Luzon. IPO miles from Manila. It is
one of tlu- most symmetrical mountains
in the world, rising In rr-jjular. conical
form Jl? a hri Kht of 5274 feet above the
sea. The view of the immense mas 3la
very Imposing, for its surroundings are
comparatively low and t!;it. There ar->
no secondary cones on its flanks, and all
the lavas that form it neem to have been
poured from the solitary chimney at its
top. The fluid ejecta that built it up mi
spread quite evenly over its sides and its
r>uae now- has a circuit of about eighty
miles. â¢ '
, * %n- a *1 r and Yon Drasr-h*. with
fv r -. at .. dlfllcul *y- rea<l hed the summit in
J*.o, they could find no trace of a crater
properly so called. For many yonrÂ» beforo
IS?7 the volcano had ejected very llttlo
lava in its frequent eruptions, but hail
covered the surrounding district fur and
wide with quantities of ashes.
I Wore describing the r.-eent catastro
phe 1-nther Corona* briefly reviews all
the eruptions previously recorded, giving
apodal attention to those that hive oc
curred since l<*i. when the office for the
observation of rneteoi . logical and seismic
phenomena was established at Manila.
I lie first record of an eruption Is that
of 1616, which Bpllber mentioned.
Hut few details are known of It. Tho
m 0.4 inrmorable eruption, both on ac
count of Its magnitude and its destruc
tive eff.-cts. is that of IM4. when the town
or Daraga was burled deep under ashes
and the streets and buildings of Manila
wore covered with eject.., l matter wafted
thither by the wind. The outburst of
I*M-S2 was remarkable for Its duration,
but since IM4 no single eruption ha*
equaled in magnitude that which forms
the subject of Father Coronas' pamphlet.
Several of the outbursts of Mayon hayÂ»Â»
been preceded by earth tremors, and this
was the case In IVC. There were rather
severe shocks with oscllating movments
throughout the province of Albay, In
which the volcano is situated, and tho

to-day represent the class of the coast.
.1. < i shea .-> Stating Amerli a. is picked to
win the siaJic. Be made a brave start
yesterday, havinjj a short course, js
thÂ»* stake-winner last week, did in
I course.
The dogs were so evenly matched the
betting was marked by short prices. One
of the surprises of the day was the de
teat of Cash by Rest Assured. The for
mer was favorite at 5 to 2. Jesse Moore,
at odds of I to 5, beat Nancy it after a
long course. Firm Friend ran strongly,
beating the Australian dog Magic Circle.
The heaviest betting course of the day
was that between Victor King and Beauty
Spot, the former winning by one point, the
score being 6 to 5.
After Nellie Bawn and The Fram had
killed their hare a second one sprang up
under their feet. Madge Wildfire, the re
lief dog, was sent to kill the hare, but the
latter proved too strong for her and an
other dog was released. Madge has a
reputation as a killer, and this was the
lirst t'me she failed. Owing to the high
class of dogs running to-day a large at
tendance is expected. The results of the
running yesterday, with the official score,

TOPMAST IN
FRONT WITH
SPENCER UP
Downs Marcato for the Holi
day Handicap at Tanforan.
Great Run of Morinel.
To the magnificent riding of Spencer
was due solely the victory of Topmast In
the Holiday handicap, decided at Tan- '
foran yesterday. The distance, tooâ oÂ«e
mile and a quarterâ was in .or of the.
chestnut gelding, which seems not over
burdened with early speed. In the betting ;
Topmast had his price played down from
fours to 5 to 2 favoritism, replacing Ma
lay, against which the odds receded from
2Vz to 16 to 5. Malay and Hosormonde al
ternated In making the pace for the first
six furlongs, when Thorpe, on. Marcato.
became Impatient and went out in front. I
spencer moved to second position before
the stretch was reached, his mount going
along without effort. A sixteenth from
the stand Marcato was In difllcultles and
Topmast led him out with considerable to .
spare. Morinel tlnished third, and to thÂ© i
gallant little Morello mare belong all the '
honors of the race. When Caldwell sent
the Held away Forte carried the barrier
with him. causing Morinel to become en
tangled In the strands of webbing. When
the Held passed the stand the rlr>- time
she was all of twenty lengths behind the
leaders, and her run was little short of
phenomenal. With a fair start she would
undoubtedly have carried Mat Storn's
colors to the front. Malay found loS
pounds a trifle heavy, which, add to
Injudicious handling, worked his defeat.
Rain fell almost incessantly, and the at
tendance was below the avr-raÃe. Of the
half dozen favorite* turned over to the
â tarter three were returned winners.
Corrifjan's filly Sardine, with a faculty
for striking in soft spots, made an exer
cise gallop of the opening scramble for
two-year-olds. The ring laid 3 to l'J about
her, and she won, pulling up to v walk,
from Limerick. Prestome ran third
W. I^arzalere's Silver Tone I to 5 choloe
for the mile and a sixteenth recital found
the route too far after leading to th*
stretch, and ran unplaced. Daisy r then
took command of affair.-' downing the ID
to 1 shot Tappan without effort. Show
honors fell to Wyoming.
Hallsta must be a very rank and roguish
sort of a racing tool, or else Honker Is a
most eccentric rider. The i. led horse
was installed a very warm favorite for thÂ«
mile selling run following and possessed
all kinds of speed. Songer permitted
Henry on Ringmaster to cut out a snail's
pace, while he sfi-sawed with the finrt
choice in second position to the stretch.
where his horse, in disgust, then refused
to try. Peraonne tlnished strong. brim;!:;*
Henry astride, the leader to a drive, being
beaten but half .i length at the wire. The
favorite was third.
A had atari eauxed the downfall of Klnp
Carnival, second choice for the atx*fiiiionÂ«
handicap. Martin wax not liven timÂ»Â» to
K^t up to tlie barrier when It was released,
with th*> result that hÂ« was last awny.
After lien l.cdl. the favorite, had led for
two-thirds of the Journey and retired,
Bybarls took up the running. Dr. RowcH'a
pprinter lasted lung enough to down the
fast coming Carnival lÂ»-Â«9 than two
lengths. Bchrelber'a Aluminum ran Into
the show.
Monita. coupled In the bÂ»ftinp with
Rossmore, raptured the hurdle handicap.
Hidden by 1-enhart. the old Jumper pa."Â»sM
the judges two lengths before Granger,
with Ma tor s again third.

CURIOUS
Marriage
Ceremonies.
The recent performance of a marrlag<
ceremony on board a war vessel, to oblige
the bridegroom, who had been called fo
duty In the Philippines and was compÂ«llei
to anticipate the date originally set fo
! the wedding by several weeks If fa 1
! wanted to see war as a benedict, was b:
no means a unique occurrence. Strange
wedding ceremonies have been wltnesset
;by thousands. The marriage In a ehov
window originated with an enterprisln;
down East Yankeeâ a furniture dealer 01
the Installment plan, of courseâ ls sti!
heard from once in a while, though th<
first ingenious "puff" of this kind oc
curred nearly a generation ago. Mar
j riages by telegraph and telephone are alsc
! among the things that have been, and i
: marriage "up in a balloon" occasional!}
1 furnishes one of the attractions at somt
country fair.
Whether it adds to connubial bliss t<
have the marriage certificate read "Mar
rled at an altitude of 5000 feet above th<
city of X," is not known, though the ex
pectations of the contracting parties wen
certainly high. To have the man-lag,
I ceremony performed In a sporting aren:
, was the outcome of a bicycle contest ir
New York not long ago. Certainly tht:
< marriage ceremony had more witnesses
than any of the queer marriages that hap
pened before.
But America is only a recent addition t<
the countries where queer marriages oc
curred and occasionally take place to-day
The marriage by proxy, in which Augus
Spies indulged with the eccentric Nine
\ an Zandt shortly before he was hangec
in Cook County Jail, is probably the onlj
one of Its kind that ever occurred in thh
country. In European countries this forrr
of marriage has been In vogue among th<
members of royalty for many centuries
and in rare Instances It occurs at th<
present time.
Where bride and groom live at too great
a distance from each other, or where rea
sons of state prevail, the groom is repre
i sented by a proxy. According to usage ir
high circles this proxy is either a neai
relative of the bride, a brother or c
couFin, or a minister extraordinary of th.
groom. If then ever was a marriage li
which the bride was represented by proxy
history fails to record the fact. The right
of proxy seems to have been monopolized
by the gTooms.
At present such marriages by proxy
among members of royalty are excep
tions, but they occur not infrequently be
tween parties considerably lower in tht
social scale. This Is notably true Ir,
States which have colonies, and thÂ«.
United States may coon be among these
States, since the acquisition ot the Philip
pines may cause many an American bach
lor in the other hemisphere to become a
benedict by proxy, and thus wed the girl
he left behind him.
The German missionary In East Africa,
the English official in Australia, the
French soldier in Tonkin, marry by proxy.
The bride i.Â» in Europe, and the groom is
unable to leave the colony Then the
bricie marries by proxy and starts a.<
"iln.," without her husband, \;j> -n th.
wedding Journey, which Bometimed re
quires months of time.
Such a marriage by proxy Is usually
performed for practical reusons. It has
happened that such a hriilo would arrive
at the residence of the groom, only to find
thai the latter had suecumb-i} to climate
conditions or had fallen victim to the
dangers of the service. If ?hÂ»Â» should
have come as "Miss" she would, of cjur. c e.
!>e without support and without any claim
she might have had as a wife. If she ar
rives ns â¢'Mrs.' and rinds herself a widow
upon arrival sh,e If entitled to all the
claims and privileges of a widow in the
shape of pension; traveling expenses, free
transportation home, and the like.
in the case of the D.itch colonies. .lava,
th. Sunda Islands and the West Indian
Islands, thrsf marriages by proxy are
subjtot to certain rules and usages. One
may marry with the Klove or with the
hat. The colonial groom to a mule
relative or Intimate friend in Holland a
glove he has worn upon the right hand.
'i his glove is olfo ... at the ceremony
by th<- pruxv ami such a marriage is per
fectly legal under Dutch law.
The marriage win. thr- i,at is solrmn
izert In Java and oth<>r Sunda Islands If
the bride is a native woman. In such a
case the groom sends a hat. which is
worn by a mule relative of the bride dur
ing the heathen ceremony in the absence
of the groom. The natives consider such
a ceremony Mnriinp, nut the Dutch law
does not recognize it ns heal.
Similar to the marri;-t.- t ' by proxy is an
other form of marriage ceremony which
is in vogue between Kuroji? and the colo
nies. Tin.- brides nrrivo in the latter from
Kuropo by the shipload; so to speak. Not
lopr since such a carpo of hrMes came
from Herlln to th* German West African
possessions, destined for colonists who
had notified the Kovernmcnt of their in
tentions to marry. Immediately after tho
arrival of the vessel the men made their
selections from the women and the
clergymen of the various stations tied the
knots in- due form. This enterprise is of
too recent occurrence to admit of any re
port as to the blessing* enjoyed.
Certain marriage arrangements In Italy
bear a resemblance to this venture, but
they are employed only in cases of orphan
girls. Hi several cities of Central Italy
there are funds connected with the or
phanages from which young girls raised
in these Institutions receive a small dower
when they marry.
. On a certain holiday In the year the
young pirls who are to leave the orphan
age and who have the right to marry
are grouped at both sides of the altar
in church at early mass. The prospec
tive grooms, mostly young mechanics, at
tend service, during which time they take
h good look at the u'lrlÂ«>. This may or
may not intensify the devotional exer
cises of both sexes. After the service the
bachelors proceed to the sacristy and
there declare to the officiating priest that
they are willing to marry, and at the
same time they designate the girls of
their choice. If in any case the girl con
sents and if the papers of the groom*
are in shape, the matter i-< settled. At
the afternoon service the various couples
arc married In due form and the dowers
are paid over. It is said that these mar
riage* are, as a rule, happy ones, verify
ing the old adage that accident is a good
marital agent.
Conditions may arise In methodical and
law-ridden Germany which make mar
riage difficult. In such .i case there re
mains the marriage in Heligoland, where
quick and exceptional marriages are still
lawfulâ from the former English reign.
There Is a certain degree of necessity for
these Heligoland marriages. A German,
for Instance, emigrated In his early years
and this lost his citizenship. He returns
to Germany and wants to marry. Then
ho finds so many legal and technical ob
stacles to overcome that only the Heli
goland marriage remains.
The latter Is also quite opportune for
people who want to stay in Germany but
â  short time, and who want to marry
during this sojourn. A foreigner or a
German residing In a foreign country
visits Germany ami there finds the girl
of his choice. A short engagement may
be desirable, but before the necessary
papers can he procured and the requisite
proclamation and bans of marriage can
hf had months may elapse. In such a
ensp the younsr Couple takes the steamer
for Heligoland and is there "spliced" in
due form by n minister.
The latter requires an oath to the ef
fect that the parties nre unmarried, and
that 'hÂ»re exists no legal obstacle to their
marriage.

SOME GREAT BACHELORS.
Men of Mark in Politics, Art and
Literature Who ITever Married.
Samuel J. Tllden was the richest Ameri
can who ever enured public life an.l re
mained single to the end of his days. Ills
persistent celibacy was remarkable, for.
unlike Fir Thomas, Mr. Tlld.-n was born
with money, and thus from hid youth wai
considered eligible by the mammas of
many young women.
No Republican of half Mr. Tilden'a
prominence has pone through life without
marrying, but. Including David Hcnnett
Hill, who peems to be a contlrmed bache
lor Democracy's rolls show a noteworthy
triumvirate of the distinguished celibates,
James Uuchanan. the only bachelor Pres
ident, being the third member thereof.
Bucbi is understood to have refrained
from taking a wlf.* because the girl upon
whom he set his youthful affections was
obdurate, He is said to have regretted
the single state to the day of hi-; death.
Mr. Hill, on th.- other hand, is reported to
bÂ«- a bachelor from choice.
Literature kns furnished a long string
of names to the list- of eminent bachelors.
Possibly the best knÂ«Â»wn unmarried man
of letters to-day is Henry James, the nov
elist. He maintain* stoutly that the art- i
liÂ»t. no matter what the medium of his ex
pression, should remain *lnglÂ». on the
ground that the petty cares and enrpings
of domestic life tend to wear on delicately
adjusted nerves and exhaust the mental
fiber of ginlup. rrhether its possessor be
a painter of pictures, a worker lv words.
a modeler of statues, a composer of mu
Â«lc, a singer or one who amuses the peo
ple from the stage.
John Greenleai â ' Ittler was a bache
lor, though not from the same cause as
the brilliant fiction writer mentioned.
Whittier was a great admirer of the mar
ried state, we are told, and In his boy
hood had a blue-eyed, red-cheeked New
England girl for his sweetheart. Together
they went to school as children, and wrÂ»-n
they grew to youth's estate he told her
the story m"st girls like to hear. ShÂ«
heard It gladly, too, but he was poor and
a poet, and love must wait for recogni
tion. She promised, but waiting is wear
isome; before recognition came to the
gentle young versemaker she forgot him
as a lover, and was married to some one- \
else. â¢ â¢ â  â 
Edward Fitzgerald, the translator of
Omar Khayyam's â  "Strain*, was a bach
elor, and there was a romance in his life,
much like the one which saddened Whit- i
tier's, but there wan little else which they
had in common. The celibacy of Charles
Lamb was full of pathos, for he remained
single all his life that he might care for
his sister. Venerable John Burroughs,
naturalist as well as writer, and one or
the most charming of men. has never
married. Mr. Uurroughs was not even a â¢
woman-hater, neither has any one ever
surmised that a romance caused his
bachelorhood.
The only literary bachelor who in ac
knowledged to be a hater of women Is the
English poet. Algernon Charles Swin
burne. Ills sentiment appear!" to bo based
upon the fear that a womnn of little cul
ture would be dull beyond description as a
life partner, and the conviction that the
clever, well-informed woman is the least
attractive of her ?px.
Only one noted Protestant divine has
been a bachelor. He was Phillips Brooks,
who finished life as Bishop of the Epis
copal church, and seemingly possessed
every quality desirable in a m..d.-: hus
band. The cause of his remaining single '
appears never to have been understood
even by those who were closest to him ;
He did not avoid the fair, nor has any one
been able to call a romance In his life :
In his student days and in his career as ,
a clergyman he had many friendships ,
with women, while his passionate fond
ness for children wax remarked often '
His letters to some of his Juvenile friends,
published a few years ngo In one of the
magazines, were models in their way.
The bachelorhood of Sir Isaac Newton
was a puzzle to some of his contempora
ries, but others knew he remained single
solely on account of his mother. He
thought the world of her. and her affec
tion for him was unbounded: hut her ma
ternal love was marred by jealousy, and :
whenever her son thought on marriage or
evinced a passing interest In a pretty face
she wept and wrung hÂ«r hands and" man
aged somehow to check true love- course i

THE CONTINENTAL
LOAN ASSOCIATION
LEADING BUILDING CONCEBN
WEST OF CHICAGO.
Its Immense Business the Result of
Prudent and Skillful Man
agement,
The Continental Building and Loan As
sociation at California is one of the lead
ing concerns of Its kind west of Chicago.
There are 159 associations In California,
but of that number the Continental pos-
Besses one-thirteenth of the assets of the
whole. Of the total thai held by the
associations the Continental owns nearly
one-fourth.
Tha affairs of the Continental Associa
tion havo from the very lirst been skill
fully managed bo that to-day its business
has ju-fusiuU gigantic proportions. Its
system of investment is safe and protit
able and It docs business for the benefit
of its members just as a bank does busi
ness for tho benefit of its stockholders. It
Is this method that has iron the con
lidcnco of the shareholders of the Conti
nental and Increased its business far be
yond the measure enjoyed by any simi
lar Institution on th.- Pacitic Coast.
There are at the present time 15!Â» build-
Ing and loan associations in California,
the total assets of which are $20,2:>5,450 24.
Tbo assets of the Continental aggregate
H.500.0W) or about one-thirteenth of the
whole. Th.- total number of thai of
the associations In the State is 410.676. and
of that number the Continental has about
lOO.OOu. or nearly one-fourth of the whole.
The membership of tlu> 159 associations
aggregates 37.75U, and of that number the
Continental furnishes a quota of 10,100, or
nearly one-third of the wtutle. During the
year 168 homes were built in California,
and of that number the Continental built
14j, an average of nearly three per week.
These ligures show beyond question that
the Continental Building and Loan Asso
ciation stands at the head.
The principle upon which in* Continen
tal is operated has been plained repeat
edly and it will be merely referred to In
this sketch. The fun-B are loaned only on
productive real estate on a basis of 50
per cent of appraisement or on stock of
the company to the amount of BO per â¢nt
of the amount paid on thÂ« Etock. The
Continental has by adhering to sound
business methods become a standard on
questions of tlnanclal co-oneration. The
quality of the boslilesfl is of more impor
tance to the management of the Conti
nental than quantity. Owing to the care
ful investment of ltd funds the associa
tion has made larger dividends and ma
tured more stock than any other similar
Institution in the State.
Th.Â» funds and mortgages of the associ
ation are held by the trustees, the Cali
fornia Title Insurance and Trust Com
pany. In trust for the benefit of members.
Kvery title on which the association loans
money Is guaranteed by the trustee.
i thereby assuring absolute protection to
Investors. .
To the wageworker who desires to se
cure a home thÂ« Continental offers supe
rior Inducements. By the payment of a
stated 6\im per month. equal to rent per
haps, a home Is purchased at the end of
eight or ten years with comparative ease.
To the Investor It Is only necessary to add
that IS a month (dues on ten shares par
value J1000) In this association will double
Itself In about eight years and four
months. The (system Is one of profit to
the borrower as well as the Investor, as
both share In the profits which both con-
Jointly enjoy.
The officers of the. Continental Building
and Loan Association are prudent busi
ness men. In whose hands the affairs of
the Institution nre absolutely safe. The
president Is Captain Oliver Eldrldge, the
well-known millionaire of this city. The
vice president Is Charles Page, the capi
talist. William Corbln Is secretary and
manager Mr. Corbln Is a sagacious and
prudent business man and the association,
under his skillful management of Its af
fairs. Is enjoying unexampled prosper
ity. The ofllcos of the association are lo
cated at 222 Bansome street, San Fran
cisco.
FATHER YORKE GIVEN
A WARM RECEPTION
LEAGUE OF THE CROSS CADETS
EXTEND A GREETING.
Company I of St. Peter's Parish Wel
comes the Eloquent Priest, Who
Will Be Their Pastor.
The members of Company I of the
League of the Cross Cadets assembled in
their hall on Alabama street, near Twen
ty-fourth, on Friday night for the purpose
of greeting their now pastor. Rev. Father
Yorke. Tho reception tendered the elo
quent priest was a grand testimonial of
the regard In which he Is held, especially
by the members of his new charge.
The. address of welcome was read by
Captain Powers, who referred In glowing
terms to the services rendered to the
League of the Cross by Father Yorke, and
declared that It was owing to his energy
and zeal that they owed their existence
as a cadet organization.
Continuing, Captain Power said that
the young men of San Francisco had no
better friend than Father Yorke, and the
church no braver defender. For his ef
forts to save young men from the perils
that Burroufld them and Instill into tbelr
l minds the principles that coo&tltuta trua
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, STHSTDAY, DECEMBER 17. 1899.
manhood, the years of Father Torke'e
ministry had been distinguished.
"When the Catholics of this country
were attacked by unscrupulous enemies,
when villainous bigots tried to crush them
out of existence, It was Father Yorke who
drove the sewer rats to their hiding places
and made It .possible for honest men to
live In peace."
For th<Â»Bo services Captain Power b<*
lleved the Catholics of San Francisco, es
peclally thÂ« young men. were deeply
Krateful. The sentiments of the commu
nity In this regard had already been ex
pressed, Bald Captain Power, and we
merely wished to emphasize those of the
league of the CrosÃ Cadets at St. Peter's
parish.
He congratulated the reverend gentle
man on his safe arrival home and made
him welcome to St. Peter's, and while he
reitretted the necessity that compelled
iheir beloved Father Casey to leave them
for a while, he could not but rejoice that
Father Yorke had been chosen as their
pastor.
In conclusion Captain Power assured
Father Yorke that the members of Com
pany I would leave nothing undone to
make themselves worthy of the fatherly
care and solicitude of their new pastor.
Father Yorke thanked the boys for the
warm reception accorded him. and said
he was proud that his labors in behalf of
the League of the Cross had been attend
ed with some success. He had not been
brought in close contact with Company I.
but us welfare was Included In that of the
whole retiment. for the success of which
he was always solicitous.
To shield the boys of the city and
fit them for a worthy citizenship had been
one of the chiof aims of his ministry.
"The Raloon is the preat danger to the
youth of our day," said Father Yorke.
"From the saloon a short road opens.
Along that road a hole Is soon reached
into which the victim of Intemperance
falls, never to rise attain."
tinning, he said if the League of the
Cross Cadets would be useful citizens and
worthy members of the church, as the
promoters oi" their organization meant
them to be, they mu*t cultivate habits <">f
manliness. The nninly man cannot l>* a
bad man. They must be sober and Indus
trious.
Father Yorke sympathized with the boys
for the Borrow they experienced through
Father â¢Casey 1 Illness and hia temporary
retirement from the parish. Among the
many care* of Father <"asey that which
he hnd for the I^eapue of the Cross Cadets
Â«.ts by no means the least.
Father Yorke In conclusion assured the
boys that during the time of his pastorate
he wouM do his utmost to further their
interests and Increase the membership of
thHr organization.
Songs and recttatloni and a drill by the
company brought tho proerammÂ© to a
close. Amonff those present were: Rev.
James McDonald. Rev. Philip O'Ryan,
Rer. William Lyons, Rev. James ft ran t,
Hrothers F.rmlnbld. Felan and William,

and many other friends of the boys.

TO HIS INJURIES
Dies at the Receiving
Hospital.
AN UNSUCCESSFUL OPERATION
â¦â â â
MOTORMAN HEATLY ARRESTED
FOR MANSLAUGHTER.
â¦
Robert Duncan Milne, the brilliant
writer, died at the Receiving Hospital
yesterday afternoon as a result of the
injuries he received when struck by a Mc-
Allister tftreet car on Market street, near
Montgomery, Friday night. In the hope
of saving his life Dr. Heinle performed the
operation of trephining the skull yester
day morning, but the fracture was too
severs and at 3:30 o'clock Milne breathed
his last without recovering consciousness.
A few minutes after his death three la
dles called at the hospital to bee him ajid
were shocked to hear of his death. They
intimated that for the sake of his fam
â  ily In Scotland they would see that the
body was decently interred. ThÂ« body
I was removed to the Morgue.
About on hour later Philip Heatly, the
motorman of the car that Injured Milne,
surrendered himself at the City Prison
j and was booked on a charge of man
slaughter. He was released on his own
j recognizance by Judge Graham. Ho
| claimed that he could not be held ro
â¢ sponsible, as he had rung his bell and
had done everything to stop the car be
: fore it struck mint and knocked him
down.
Mr. Milne was the son of the late Rer.

where he distinguished himself by gaining

I public echools in England and Ireland, ;
and thlidlv. the Bucclouch gold medal as
senior and captain ol the school, of the
eleven of which he was also captain.
From Glenalmond Mr. Milne proceeded
to Oxford, where he further distinguished
â¢ himself by taking honors, also rowing in

pull through." Bald Mr. Wells, "and I look
for a surplus In the general fund at the
end of the fiscal year, which surplus may
be reapportioned to the other depleted
funds. The records of our office show
also that the delinquent taxes are being

will all go to swell the general fund."

BONDS OF CITY
FREE FROM TAX
Says They Should Be
Kept Home.
SAVINGS BANKS CONCERNED
EASTERN STATES NOW REAP A
810 HARVEST.
Â»
A strong campaign will be made In favor
of the constitutional amendment to be
submitted to the people for adoption or
rejection next November to remove the
: taxation from State, county and munici
pal bonds. The Merchants' Association
and the Municipalities Convention have
declared In favor of the proposed amend
ment. In fact, the proposition was
brought before the Legislature by reason
of the action of the Merchants' Associa
, tion. It Is also favored by the Bank Com
missioners. The Importance of the matter
] becomes apparent In view of the forth
> coming bond elections to provide funds
, for the extension of the park area of the
city, for the new schoolhouses and the
sewer system. Unless the amendment to
1 the constitution shall be adopted the in
terest upon all the bonds to be voted will
be paid out of the State, as the Interest
on about all the State, county and muni
cipal bonds has been paid out ever since
the "new" constitution went Into effect.
The amount of the municipal issue of San
Francisco, if the different propositions to
be submitted to the people shall carry,
will amount to Jll.uuO.Ouo. The State ferry
1 bonds, to the amount of t600,000, are now
held out of the State and the interest
money goes abroad. At the same time the
savings banks of California cannot profit
; ably hold either State, county or munici
i pal bonds of California as an Investment,
while outsiders llnd them good for money
I making.
Mayor Phelan Introduced the resolutions
concerning the taxes on bonds that were
adopted by the Municipalities Convention.
Yesterday he gave an explanation of the
| matter. "Thar situation Is this," said the
Mayor, "If the constitutional amendment
! shall fall to be adopted all the Interest on
t the new bonds to be issued by San Fran
i cisco will go abroad. If the amendment
shall pass there will be a way to keep the
money at home. The constitution makes
all bonds taxable. The Supreme Court of
the State has held that this constitutional
provision does not apply to the bonds of
semi-public corporations. That issue Is
before the Supreme Court in the Hlbemla
Bank case now, resulting from the assess
ment by Mr. Dodge. But there has been
no question concerning the taxability of
State, county and municipal bonds. I in- :
troduced the resolutions adopted by the
Merchants' Association because I knew
then that there would be a call for a local
bond issue of this city to consider. You
can see what It would amount to on the
$11,000,000 of bonds if they should all be
voted.
"A striking feature of the situation now
13 that our savings banks are unable to
Invest the funds of their depositors. At
the same time the people who pay taxes
to provide the money for the payment of
the interest on the bonds are not able to
invest in the bonds profitably. The East
ern man grabs up our bonds and he can
hold them profitably because he does not
have to pay taxes on them. But our sav
ings banks must pay tax' on any bonds
of the daM mentioned that they may
hold. They are compelled to show them
up to the Bank Commissioners, and It is
an open door In the matter of information
to the Assessors. The private Individual
may evade taxes through perjury.
"Of course our bond elfctions take place
within a few days, and the proposed con
stitutional amendment will not come up
for adoption until November, 1900. It will
not be necessary to issue any of our new
bonds until the time comes to pay for
something. In the case of thÂ« park bonds .

WESTERN TURF ASSOCIATION
"X" "7T "T" HEN th* Western Turf Association
\/ \/ desired some months ago to construct a
racetrack that should be up to date In all
Its appointments end at the same time
be the very fastest possible, A. M. Allen, the veteran
of eclentlflc track designers, was the name that
naturally suggested Itself, and the masterpiece of tho
man who built Ingleslde, Oakland and Harlem was
opened on November ID under 'he name of Tanforan.
Since that time the track's reputation for accessi
bility, speed and clean sport has been of mushroom
growth.
On the day Its grates first opened to the public a
new era was opened In turf circles. Easily reached
from Ban Francisco and the suburbs, located In a
green hollow between thÂ« rolling hills of South San
Francisco and San Bruno. Its Bite Is an Ideal one for
the purpose.
Pacing through the new cut which has so short
ened the distance between the city and San Mateo,
the train deposits Its passengers on a covered plat
form several hundred feet long, and protected from
the weather by an ornamental roof. From the plat
form to the main entrance Is not quite 120 feet. This
covered way extends to the stairway, which leads to
the upper stories of the Grand Stand. And In this
structure the application of up-to-date Ideas and ap
pliances in every department has provided patrons
with every comfort and convenience, and It Is second
to none of it* kind In the world.
The stairways are not the least noteworthy portion
of it. the main one being no less than seventy feet in
width, with broad, shallow steps, which render the
ascent easy and uiiftttlgulng. The first landing Is nt
tht half-story. Here the stairway branches right and
left Riving access to the seats and all other parts of
thf%tÂ«nd.
From here the view of the track and surrounding
country is magnificent. The eaves of the roof are
graceful segtnental arches, in the Italian renaissance
style, supported by Blender iron columns, and the
tiers of seats are so arranged as not to render these
the sllcht'-st obstacle to the spectator's field of vision.
The main floor is given over to dining-rooms.
lunch-rooms, kitchens, a barber-shop, and many
other conveniences. Nor have the ladles been for
gotten. Â»A gallery reserved for their use exclusively
and commanding. a view of the betting ring, together
I with reception and drawing rooms, occupies the In
termediate or half-story.
Directly in the rear of the tiers of peats one of the
most novel features In the wtructure I- revealed In the
Ehape of a magnificent balcony promenade, affording
n stroll over two hundred and ten feet in length and
forty odd feet In width. Inclosed on all sides with
class this unique annex has proved an Immense at
traction to patron*, who between the races can
lounge here, or on rough, windy days watch their ac
quaintances from a sheltered coign of vantage. On
this floor also are dining and wine rooms.
Immediately facing turfites on the first landing is

clear view of start and finish of every event and of
the course during Its running. This Is a feature un
common enough to earn the grateful appreciation of
every sportsman. In the ring are accommodations
for fifty books, and heavy storm doors may be drawn
when inclement weather compels. Two well
appointed bars and an Inviting lunch counter provide
for the inner man. Three thousand may with case
mingle in this commodious section without passing
from under the second floor. The total length of the
Grand Stand is 234 feet, while the depth Is 103 feet.
The total cost was 135,000.
The track has since its completion, in spite of ad
verse prophecy, proved the fastest known in thÂ«
West. Several highly sensational records, made even
in winter, have proved to doubting Thomases its
speedy quality. It Is faster than Ingleslde. Oakland
or Harlem, and very little sand has been used In the
top dressing.
There are paddocks, stables and coach houses ga
lore for the accommodation of those attending on
horseback or In carriages. There is a promenade In
front of the Grand Stand, which permits ladles to se
cure a view of the paddocks. The infield Is a spacious
Inclosure for the reception of carriages, tally-hos and
phaetons.
â¢ At the north end stable accommodations for entries
is provided, and the training and sleeping quarters
have their location there.
The property of the Western Turf Association con
sists of about one hundred and fifty acres, the estate
being situated In San Mateo County, twelve and a
half miles from San Francisco. Thick groves of
eucalyptus trees surround it, drawing the moisture
from the ground and materially assisting in keeping
the track from getting "sloshy." and protecting it
from the brisk breezes and heavy sea mists of tha
Pacific. Special trains, passing through some beau
tiful scenery, make the run in twenty minutes, and
the electric road is constructing a new double track,
which when completed will reduce the time from the
ferry to a little over an hour. At present transfers
can be obtained from the Valencia to the-
Fourteenth-street line, and from the Baden terminus
a well-appointed 'bus covers the mile and a half to
the Park in a very few minutes. Racing commences
every day at 1:30 p. m. sharp, and special trains leave
for the scene every morning and afternoon, returning
to the city immediately at the close of the pro
gramme.
The Southern Pacific has under construction the
Bay Shore line, which will bring the ride within a
very few minutes of San Francisco. The manage

PAiACE AND GRAND HOTELS.
San Francisco's Famous Caravansa
ries.
The Inhabitant of San Francisco and
that portion of the State adjacent to this
city have long since ceased to express sur
prlso or In fact manifest more than a
passing interest In the erection of larÂ«e
and costly hotels In this or other sections
of the country.
This lack of Interest can be attributed
to the fact that to this city belongs the
distinction of having within It* limits the
largest hotel In the world. Nor Is tha
knowledge that the Palace Hotel Is the
most colossal structure ever erected for
the entertainment of travelers confined to
the people of California. Trans-continen
tal tourlsts-"g|.,bÂ«. trotters." as they are
familiarly termedâ come prepared to view
a mammoth Institution, and yet thHr
astonishment at Drat beholding the Pal
ace Hotel cannot be disguised.
It was built by men who believed Snn
Francisco was destined to occupy a con
spicuous place In the commercial history
of the country-and .......
prove conclusively the correctness of this
belief.

Some Idea of Its Immensity can be form

of the men who conceived th* scheme of
giving to San Francisco â¢ hotel of thlÂ»
magnitude, they did not overlook the first
principle In building such a hostelryâp-r
feet sanitation, large, apartment*, with
every convenience that was obtainable
twenty-five years ago.
Recent Inventions Intended to promote
the comfort of guests have been .1.1,1 t.
until to-day the Palaca Is known not so
much for its mammoth proportions as
for Its general excellence.
The grillrooms have, by their unsur

In a city that Is known for Its fine res

INDUSTRIES OF
SAN FRANCISCO
It will be seen from a historical view
of San Francisco how It has crown from
a small semi-barbarous settlement and
with the process of time has developed by
successive stages Into one of the wealthi
est, proudest and most promising of the
ten largest cities of America.
Systematic organization among the
business men of large cities Is to a certain
extent a necessity alike for the purpose
of self protection and the promotion of
public welfare.
In April. MS, the Chamber of Commerce
was organized: on June 1, IS6S. the Mer
chants' Kxchange. with a capital stock
of $250,000. cam* Into existence; these
were followed by the Board of Trade, the j
Stock BxcfaancÂ« Board, the Produce Ex
change, etc. This article, however, Is to \
deal tan with these than with the manu
facturing Industries of Han Francisco,
which are second to no city in the world
of equal population. Necessity was In |
truth the mother of Invention and manu
facturing here. California is especially
rich In the metals, gold, silver, copper anil
tin being principal, although nearly
every description of metal is found in
greater or less abundance, arid it is prob
able that the necessity of having suitable
machinery to develop these ore depo.sits
and the inadequate transportation facili
ties existing in the early days of Cali
fornia sharpened the wits and prompted
an extra exertion of many of the min
ing experts of this State.
JurnÂ«*s W. Marslia'l discovered roM at
na, California, forty-flve miles north
â¢â .-i-^t of Sacramento, January vj, imb. The
attention of the civilised world was at
tracted toward California. At the time
of this discovery Sati Kranclseo had but
X*< population, but the year of I!HS paw
39,000 Immigrants flock here from all over
the world, and during IM9 $1,500,000 a
month was taken from the newly dlsrov
eied rlacer diijginsK in this State. It is
not to be wondered at. then, that wÂ« ex
cel In the manufacture of mining ma-
Chinery. There are msrhlnw invented
from time to time which, whe.n Intro
di<e!, urove nv>st valuahlfl to the Indus
try or the purpose for which they were
r :cted. There is hardly a stride line
of anything manufactured which could
pace with the great competition
found in every branoh and pursuit of mer
cantile interests at present, if It were not
for the time and labor saving devices
used In their construction. It la a difficult
mutter for the busy mnn to keep In touch
with the latest inventions, especially
When they come with such manifold reg
ularity, and it is not the purpose of this
article to speak In a biased way of any
particular ni:m:jfacturer or machine, but
. â¢â¢ particularly some of the ma
chinery which originated In this city and
whlcb has boÂ«-n lnstnlled in such a way
give the purpose a national slgnirt-
It has been asserted by various well
P'Thoms on the lecture platform
and from thÂ» editorial desk that San
:sco Is nothing more than a "way
Station," through wliich passes the great
commercial tide from East to v *Â»^t. leav
ing Lut a small percentage i \.ilue In
the city. This construction "i Mm Fran
cisco's l'U*inÂ»*>s life is entire ; erroneous,
for in the extent and variety >>f her man
ufactures this city can hold her own with
any of approximate size and with m;tny
much greater in population and age. Much
attention has LÂ«"-n paid of late to a pecu
liar <-la. c s of machinery iifMissaijl fur the
s;iv!i,k of gold In the sands of Cape Nome
and York. The Krogh Manufacturing
Company are keeping pace with the tim-*.
as 'hey come to the front with the Drake
amalgamator. They are the sole manufac
turers of this machine, Which is a very
blmple and practical device. The Kros;n
Manufacturing Company's suction dredge
aiid centrifugal pumps have a reputation
second to none in thÂ« State.
This locality demonstates very well the
particular aptness of our machinery men
for readily grasping situations. The Stan-
H'.aus Dredging Company give ua the
Donahue patent caisson dredge, which
they have used largely in recovering gold
from the river bottoms of California. Tha
California and Alaska Qold Dredging
Company propose to take this dredge to
Alaska.
The Kisdon Iron Works are known
throughout the civilized world for tha
manufacture of dredging and mining ma
chinery, and they ship their dredges to
many foreign countries as well mm to all
parts of the L'nited States.
bly there has been no machinery
In this section that has received the at
tention given the various classes used In
hydraulic work.
This is iarK'-:.'. due to the necessity of
Irrigating and to the fact that great lureÂ©
Iv derived from the mountain streams,
which can be Stored and used In the dry
â  Â« for producing power, the water
IH-ing largel) placed in reservoirs during
the rainy season and utilized In the sum
mer for tha purpose of operating ma
chinery. In this connection might be
mentloi;ed the Pelton water wheel, which
is distinctively a California product and
Is Justly regarded as a most useful Inven
tion. By it water Is converted into power
In a simple and economical way. These
wheels are sent away from this city In
large numbers to all parts of the world,
and their popularity shows that they have
met the most sanguine expectations of the
purchaser. San Francisco can feel hon
ored that this wheel recently received an
award of the Elliot Cresaon gold medal
of tha Franklin Institute of Pennsylvania.
The Abner Doble Company of this city
have evolved a water wheel pronounced
by experts In tangential water wheels to
be one of the most perfect in construc
tion manufactured to-day and the results
obtained fiom the working of this wheel
have glvrn the Abner Doble Company
high rank in the field of hydraulic en
gineering. Tl.ey have recently Installed
a plant for the Mount Whitney Power
Company at Vlsalia, Cal.. developing iflOO
horsepower under a head of 300 feet.
Centrifugal pumps are almost an exclu
sive manufacture of this city. They are
used lar^'.-ly la dredging and are mu-ie
elthtr single or compound for city wat.-r
works. Irrigating, reclamation of land,
mining*, dredging, pumping rock, gravel,
pulp, etc., and many of them are spe
claily designed sand and gravel pumps,
adapted for Cape Nome and Klondike
mining. The Byron Jackson Machine
Works of this city are very large miin
ufacturers of centrifugal pumps. The
business of this nrm is not confined to
California. Their pumps are In use at the
Peoria Water Works. Peorla, 111., and also
at the city of Rockford, 111., where three
10-lnch vertical centrifugal pumps were
Installed.
Another leading: Industry Is the manu
facture of gas engines. Throughout the
entire East It te an acknowledged fact
that the gas engine has acquired greater
perfection on the Pacific Coast than in
any other locality. They are manufac
tured here from l^ horsepower to 200
horsepower. Among the more prominent
producers of these engines are the Her
cules Gas Engine Works and the- Union
Gas Engine Works. The engines of these

two concerns can be found In every civil
ized quarter of the globe.
The Imperial concentrating and atral
gamating table is the latest Invention of
Mr. George E. Woodbury, who Is one of
the pioneer concentrator builders of this
country. Machines of his manufactu-e
are In general use In every quarter of the
globe where the milling of ores Is carried
on.
The Vulcan Iron Works were established
in this city In 1851 and are consequently
one of the oldest Industries In the city.
Their shops cover 40,w0 square feet of
â¢pace. They are engaged principally In
manufacturing refrigerating and Ice-miX
ing machinery. Their machinery operates
on the "Compression System," the cooling
effe.t being produced by evaporation of
liquid anhydrous ammonia.
However, the fact remal/is that In spite
Of the vast amount of money Invested In
these industrla.l pursuit* on this coast a
large umount of machinery is shipped
here from Eastern States, both overland
ar.d around the Horn. The freight on this
tonnnge is enormous, and many thou
sands of dollars" worth of machinery finds
Its way out here and Into our mines each
year. It is hoped that the r^atl-ra of this
article will give the San Francisco manu
f.u ; ;rer an opportunity at least to com
pete for any commodity which they may
desire to purchase, because, everything
being equal, there is no question but that
local manufacturers can meet all the re
quirements, both as to service and price.
The commerce of this city is Increasing
from year to year, and th.- affect of add
ing the new and valuable territory includ
ed in the Philippines and Hawaii will be
to greatly increase this commerce. No
city In the world has greater commercial
possibilities than Ban Francisco, which
Will cv. ntually command the bulk of the
Oriental trade, and through her gateway
will pans the business b*Â»tw'ee n the East
and West. Never was there a time more
propitious to the successful promotion of
local enterprise.
NEW METHOD OF DETECTING GOLD.
A new method of detecting the presence
of a small quantity of gold has been re
cently discovered by Dr. Ohler. By this
method the presence of quantities as low
as 77 centigrams per ton may be estab
lished. The operation In as follows: A
quantity of linely powdered ore. say 120
grams. Is Introduced Into a flaak. To
this an e<]iuil volume of tincture of iodine
is added, and the mixture well agitated.
It Is then left an hour, agitating from
time to time, and Is finally allowed to
stand. When the solution has separated,
a band of filter paper Is saturated with
this, and the paper allowed to dry. This
operation is repeated five or six times in
succession. In order to completely saturate
the paper. It Is afterward calcined, and it
will be observed that the anh. when gold
is present, offers a purple color. â¢ This
color should disappear quickly If the ash
is moistened With bromine water. The
test may be modified in the following
manner: A Quantity of thÂ« powder. 120
grams, is covei Â»d with bromine water
and after agitating during the course of
an hour, the solution Is filtered. Upon
adding protochloride of tin to the solution
It takes a purple color, in tne presence of
gold, giving the reaction known as "Pur
ple of Cassiun." In the case of sulphides
the ore should be previously roasted, and
when the mineral contains a considerable
proportion of carbonate of lime, it should
be calcined In the. presence of ammonium

THE ISLANDS OF LOWER CALIFORNIA.
Along the coast line of Lower Califor
nia, both on the Pacific and Gulf sides,
are numerous groups o f inlands. Some
of these are large, others are small.
Many of thfm are valuable for their min
eral and other resources. On Cedros Island
are mines of K"ld. silver and copper. San
Jose Island, forty miles northwest of La
Pat, 1b twenty-one miles long and tt-n
miles wide. The Inhabitants are engaged
In cattle raisins and salt manufacture.
Th*Â»re are also large deposits of marble
and gypsum on this island, but they are
undeveloped. In 1881 a vein of gold and
silver ore was discovered, which was pro
fitably worked for five years.
On Cutallna Island, eighty miles north
west of La Pan, there are undeveloped sil
ver veins. There are on this Island, as on
a number of others along the coast, valu
able poarl fisheries.
Carmen Island is 126 miles northwest of
I*a Par. It is 130 miles long and elKht
miles wide. On this island are large <ie
posits of salt, which are worked through
out the year, giving employment to a
large number of men. There are said to
be rich deposits of gold and copper on this
island also, but they, like the others, are
undeveloped.
That there is great interest being takon
In the mineral resourses of the Philippines
Is evident, but those who have in consid
eration a trip to the South Seas for the
purpose of Investigating in that direction
should remember that knowledge of the
resources of the Interior of those Islands
Is of the most limited kind. The war has
been carried on along and near the corst
where there are no mines, and the interior
is a terra incognita as yet. The rugged

' ASSESSABLE VS. NON-ASSESSABLE STOCL |
Mining and Scientific Press.
There appears to be a never-ending dis
: cussion as to the relative 'merits of as
sessable vs. non-assessab!e mining shares.
' Mining companies have been very success
fully operated under each, and many have
j failed under each method of raising money
!to carry on business. There are advan
j tapes In both assessable and non-a>scns
t able stocks and disadvantages In either.
In California all corporate stock is as
sessable, and any promise on the part of
directors to not levy assessments would
not be recognized In the courts If It were
later determined to make such levy. Theie
are a few corporations In California or
ganized under the laws of other States
| the stocks of which are non-assessable.
; The great fortunes made In ComPtock
: mining storks, all of which are assessable.
i hns resultc d in the people of the Pacific
j slope being educated to the assessment .
plan, and there are those who profess to
believe that stock Issued on the non-aa
â¢ sessable basis Is prima facie evidence of
i | Intent to dÂ».-fraud.
I j Colorado offers abundant evidence to
: provC that the non-assessable stock plan.
. when properly -and honestly handled, re
! suits aÂ« satisfactorily as the assessable
stock basis, disproving the statement that !
j am: cannot be successfully opened,
j equipped and operated on the non-assÂ«*ss
i able plan. When stock is assessable money
i needed to equip and explore the mine, or
i for any other purpose. Is raised by an as
! F^ssment of a stated amount per chare.
! This plan can be continued Indefinitely, as
j long in fact as the shareholders will put :
1 up, and authenticated instances are on ,
j record where several millions of dollars
! have been paid in by stockholders of a
| mining company under the assessment
| plan axd not a single dollar ever dls-
I bursed in the form of dividends, but. on
j the other hand, the stock of some of the
I largest, best managed, and beet paying
j mine* in the United States are assessable.
When money is required the board of
i directors formally levies an assessment.
i advertises It and otherwise advises stock-
I holders of the fact. In the event of fail
i uro to pay the assessment the delinquent
! stock may be sold to pay said assessment
| overdue, or such portion thereof as may
ibe necessary to raise the money. By this
! method means may be secured at any
time.
Under the non-assessable scheme the
! capital stock iiÂ» usually divided into a
1 large number of shares, and a liberal per-
I centageâ SO to 60 per centâ placed in the
! treasury for sale, money being raised by
i this means to carry on the business of the
i company. In the event of a failure to sell
i the stock, or if all the treasury stock he
i sold and the money expended before the
| mine is eelf-supporting, then the cora
: pany'a resources for raising funds are at
I an end, unless a voluntary suftsoriplion he
made pro rata by stockholders to continue
i ;rr;i:;i :.s; and failure to do this bus
more than once closed down what later I
j proved to be a valuable property. How
[ ever, under ordinary circumstances, tlie
i amount of money provided for by the fm\o
! of treasury stock in non-asÂ«Â»>ssable com
panies Is usually sufficiently large to
i demonstrate the value of the rj'ne â be It
. good or bad, and the probability la that
where the sum provided for by sale of
stock In non-assessable companies fails
to place the property on paying basis, if
it were operated on the assessment plan,
the mine would be closed down before an
equal amount had been paid In, by reason
, of failure cf stockholders to respond to
the â¢11 of the directors for more money,
which emphasizes the fact that the chief
element of success In mining is a good
mine.
BUSTING IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES.
Xltro poTvder and black powder may
often be employed to advantage in the
same hole, whir* largo masses of rock
are to be dislodged by a single series of
blasts Holes are trilled at Btatrd dis
tances apart, usually 10 to If feet, and set
back from the face a similar distance,
according to the character of the ground.
These holes are generally Btarted by
Â«trikinif the drill with a hammer, but are
finished by â¢'churning." They are mad*
12 to 20 ftet doep. again depending on the
character of the ground. When finished
they are chamberedâ that la, a small
quantity, one to three Bticks of No. 1
powder is exploded in the bottom of each
for the purpose of â hsttering the rock
about the bottom of the hole to make
ppace for a heavier charge of powder at
the bottom. Then a quantity of nltro
powder, and sometime* a ke?r or more of
black powder, is poured Into each hole,
and the tÂ«et of holes Is discharÃÂ»-d by the
electric spark or by fuses cut to discharge
as closely together as possible, though the
latter lo^cs the benefit of cpntempora
neous discharge by the electric irk or
by P'-cund or two elapses between the ex
plosions. The nitro powder, being a det
onatlve compound, explodes Immediate
ly, shattering the nurrounding rocks; the
black powder, being a combust ive com
pound, exerts 's force more slowly and
lifts the fractured rock mass, throwing
it out of its porltion and rendering it
accessible to the miner. This class of
blasting is particularly suited to open
cut work, where it is not desirable to
scatter the rock by the force of the blast.

THE WORLDS ODTPDT FOR 1898.
The production of gold In the United
States In the calendar year ISPS was 3.118,
&<> ounces fine, of the value or $64,463,000.
The amount of gold produced from quarts
mines in ICOS1 C OS was, in round numbers, 2.500,
000 fine ouni't'g and from Dlacer mines
31Â«/iJ0 fine ounces. The South African Re
public produced 3.531.955 ounces One, â¢>{ the
value of $79,213,953. Australasia produced
3, 137.044 ounces line -I the value of itri,-
H'ji.i-W.
These three divisions are the great pro
ducers of the .world, thÂ«lr output aggre
gating 10.058.017 ounces fine, of the value
of J205,a37,7i3, or 73 per cent of the pro
duct of the rid.
Next comes Russia with ?25,4fi3.400; Can

DSy.uGO. or over 21 per cent of the whole,
leaving 6 per cent to the remainder of
the world.
The world's gold production In ':<â ' was
12,904,263 ounces line, of the value of J2-57,
425,G00. an Increase over the product of
1S:Â»7 of 2,251,831 ounces, valued at $48,018,600.
Since IKS 7. when about J100.000.000 was pro
duced, each year has shown an Increase,
over the preceding one.
The United States still occupies the sec
ond place as a silver producer. In IS9B
Its output amounted to 54.43^.fi0i fine
ounces, with a commercial value of $32,
113,400. Th*> world's production of silver
In IMS was 165.235,572 ounces fine, an in
crease of 1.222,400 ounces fine over ISO 7.
LIFE OF TITLE TO A MINING CLAIM.
The "life of the possessory title to a
mine claim Is its representation In the
manner provided by law and the local
rules and regulations. Possession, with
out a location, carries no title; possessory
titles do not live upon possession alone.
Let this proposition be understood. The
mere naked possession of a mining claim
upon the public domain Is not sufficient
to hold such claim against a subsequent
location mnde in pursuance of â¢-:. law,
and kept alive by a strict compliance
therewith. This fact is pretty generally
understood among old miners, but many
who are locating claims do not under
stand it. Many must learn that they
must first c ply with the local rules and
regulations, and second that they observe
the law governing the powieselon of the
ground. The Government grants no
mineral claim unless there be a location
according to law and the district rule*
and regulations.
Upon the above point the Supreme
Court of the United States says: "The
right to the possession comes only from
a valid location. Conseauently If there Is

The swelling of rocks In minÂ»s Is due to
various causes. among them being a
niolectilnr enlargement of the constituents i
of the rock 11. a- upon b<lng exposed to '
the atmosphere. In *>om*Â» c sea very soft
rock Is fon#M Into the workings by pres
sure from the surrounding rocks. The
pressure exerted by swelling ground Is al
most Irresistible, and cannot be held by
timbers without relieving the ground. It
i.- cheaper In the end to sink the shaft of
a mine In the hard rock of the foot or
hanging wall rather than In the Â»oft
crevice of a vein, the walls of which are
swelling ground.

Commenting on what the mines of Pl
oche, Nevada, have done and what they
may be made to do with the Utah and
Pacific Railway extended to that camp,
thÂ»Â« Kumar Lode says: The mines of
Plochc have paid over $30,000,000 dividends
In the years gone by, and as near as can
be known they were closed down on ac
count of the water,, with plenty of ore
in sight. There is no 'doubt that there Is
still plenty of silver-lead ores in the camp.
and nil that Is necessary is for a good
company to get hold of the mines.
A new distriot Is being opened at Cape
York. 120 miles from Cape Nome. It Is
reported only second In Importance to the
latter district, with rich beach diggings,
good pay on the numerous creeks flowing
into the ocean and with the further ad
advantcge of a good harbor and safe
anchorage. There are 200 miners in the
c.amn at present, ail well boused and .pro
visioned for a year. They anticipate be
ing able to commence work by the middle
of May or the first of June.

Whether placer mining camps assure
the Immediate presence of gold-bearing
quartz bodies, or whether they do not.
gold-bearing quartz lodes have been found
In a very few placer ground areas, while
thousands of them have been worked out
completely without a piece of quartz as
big as a man* fist being found.

Into the pockets of one old California

SWAPPING STORIES.
The "Major's Observations" About
Very Early Chicago.
"I spent my vacation.' said the major,
"in one of the old-fashioned villages of
Central Ohio. I have known the village
for fifty or "sixty years, and I supposed
all the old pioneers had gone. But I found
one of these, Spaftord Hurd. sitting on
a bench In front of the village Btore talk
ing in much the same vein that some of
his contemporaries talked In when I was
a boy. As I came up he was saying- -I
never was In Chicago, but I got as far a*
Joliet once.' mo
"He stopped to greet me. and then In
answer to the winks and smiles of this
young men In the circle, said: 'That was
In 1837. and before there waa any stat*'..
prison at Joliet. It was when Chicago was*
no larger than Joliet. Our family went
through from eastern central New York
In wagons, headed for Chicago. At Joliet
my father was taken sick, and the doc
tor said he would never be any better if
he remained in what was then a malarial
country. With this decision before uTWe
decided to take my father back to New
York State. lo i>ew
"We put a feather bed In what was then
known as a mover's wagon, and. placing
the sick man thereon, started on the lonf
Journey overland to our old home in New
York. My sisters left the party at Day^
ton. Ohio, and meeting a lot of young fel
lows from the Eastliere. who had en
gaged to drive stage. I dropped out and
enlisted as a stage driver on the old Na
tional road. My brothers went on with
my father to the old home, where he re
covered and where he lived to air a good
many prejudices against 'Illinois coun
"Thoso old pioneers." said the colonel
"were the most hospitable men that ever
lived. In spite of their prejudices I can
remember ono of our well-to-do farmers
who moved from Central Ohio to Central
Illinois when there were no homes on the
grand prairie, and who, establishing him
self on one of the thoroughfares of that
day, entertained and cared for, gratui't
miÃly, an the Ohio people, and there were
hundreds of them, who passed his house.
It was not a large house, but the hospit
able woman who looked after the house
keeping could biow away a dozen people
In comfort, where we, with our large city
houses, cannot make comfortable half as
many.
"I remember she had four beds ln the
large living room. On my first visit I was
wondering how she was going to accom
modate the ladles and gentlemen of the
Pf rt>' i but as bed time came the room was
divided Into four sections by sheets and
blankets hung on ropes and there was no
embarrassment and a great deal of com
fort. In another case one of the wealth
iest of our stockraisers and farmers told
me that for four or rive years he never
knew in Just what bed he*would sleep In
his own house. In this case the house
was large and roomy and well arranged,
but there were always co many guests
that the man of the house was shifted to
suit the convenience of visitors.
"He had a large family of boys and
girls, and they always reported early In
the evening for orders aa to where they
would sleep. They never complained, but
they admitted years afterwara that they
were glad when the moving column of
emigrants was so reduced as to give them
the privilege of sleeping In their own
beds. The bovH of the family, while they
were boys drifted Into the habit of not
only sleeping in the bed to which th. y
were assigned on any particular night,
but Into the hal>it of appropriating each
other's hats, coats, boots and trousers.
On a Sunday morning the boy that was
up first fitted himself out from the gen
eral stock on hand, taking what best
suited his purpose. The Becond boy adopt
ed the same policy, and the boy who was
last to leave his bed took the remnants.
"Protests were of little avail, and the
only way that the owner of a coat could
regain possession of hi? property was to
form an alliance with his aggrieved
brother, capture the offender, throw him
down and take the coat off him. But all
these boys made strong, stalwart men.
Six of them enlisted in the Union army
when the Civil War came. One of them
was shot In battle, another died at An
dersonville and a third returned home dis
abled. The other three are living still.
Queerly enough, these survivors are more
disposed to recall the humorous Incidents
of army life than the serious.
"Speaking of comical incidents of the
war, said Captain Oscar Ludwig, "brings
to mind an incident of the blowing up of
Fort Hill, at Vlcksburg. Fort Hill. It
should be understood was tho key to the
rebel system of fortifications. Our regi
ment, the Twentieth Illinois, had charged
up to the fort on May 2'Z but was ordered
back on the 23d, and,"laid elege in the reg
ular way. In June we proceeded to dig
an open tunnel toward the fort for the
purpose of mining. A car loaded high
with cottnn bales was pushed in front to
protect the diggers, and tho tunnel or
trench was covered as we proceeded to
protect us from the rebel lire. Finally
we pushed the tunnel under the fort and
made ready for exploding the mines, and
our brigade made ready for the charge.
"The mines were exploded. The fort
and all the men in It seemed to go into
the air. and the Twentieth Illinois and
other regiments rushed into the gap. As
we climbed over the broken embankment
three men who had been blown up with !
the fort came down. Two of these were
white men. and they were dead. The
other, a colored man, came down with a!
mass of debris, but he w;us living. When
the boys dug him out tliey a.sked him
how ln the world he came to be In the
fort. The frightened .larky explained
that he was the servant of one of the
leading ofllcers, and that he had Just
carried to his master his dinner when
the explosion came.
"He went on to say: TÂ»at iÂ» bo, for a
fact. I came Just In time to be blowed
up. I was standln' by de side of de cap
tain when there came a nmrin' and trem
blln . an I Mf myself goln' up. In a lit- i
tie while I started down, and I met de
captain comin' up. but we didn't Fp.-ak.
He was goln' up head fust, and I was
enmn down head fust. I struck mlghtv
hard but here I is. thank the Lord and
the I suppose that If any one
would ask that darky to describe tho
Piege of Vlcksburg he would tell of his
Tj?;rÂ»m^w. ap at T th * blowing up of Fort
Hill."âChicago Inter Ocean.

I Associated Banks' Statement.
I
NEW YORK. Deo. 16.â Financier lays:
The Associated Banks of New York gained in
reservo lnst week despite the Iftct that they
loFt In cash nearly J1. 000.000. This \va* made
r<o*Â»ible through a reduction in reserve re
quirements of J1.136.5J0. du# to a shrinkage of
M a S4S,SM in deposits. The extensive ;uida
tlon which characterized the week's opt-rutions
U not r<?!lect<vl fully In the statement, but the
contraction of Ji.OM.l'jO in loang show* the
force* that were at work in the stock market.
The lntei eating portion of the statement lien in
the cash changes. Tlie tanks lost JJ.7US.COO in
circle, tut made a gain of JI.7CS.JOO in le^als.
th* net decrease Â«i>proximatlnif $370,000. The
sr^'-io loss can be traced directly to operations
With the sub-Treasury. Government receipts at
this i>oint in the lnt>t tix days havint bom
about St.OOO.OUO In excess of disbursement!!. ThW
nln la legals rlalnly refltots a resumption of
Interior funds to New York, an event that hud
b*rn foreshadowed >â¢>â¢ the rlring domestic ex
change rates at frvcral Important interior
cities. The extÂ»nt of this return flow of money
in not thovrn In the current figures, but that it
will be continuous ie<-m( very probabl*. ThÂ«
f !..â â¢ r... ;.: makes no accjunt of J2.5fjy.000 cold
exported Saturday, but on the other hand the
j?ain of a con*t<l>TaM<Â» conHijrnment of gold
from Cuha, which offi?<>ts bjr half at l^ost tho
lofs to Europe, in not Included. The Treasury
paymentl on bond lntrrent are exf.Â«?cted to Jlp
urc in the next Â»ta:Â«-rnent. Taklm: everything
Into consideration tlw ourr'-nt exhibit l>( the
banks li nut as dlKappointlnir as tlr&t Judged.
for the rcaÂ«onÂ» that have Already bÂ«-fn set
forth and for the additional revelation that
lonn now made to Kurope may be neutralized
by larger interior receipts from this time on.
The outlook docs not favor a much easier con
dition of affairs in a monetary sense, but if
the experience of a lonjr series of years can be
rolled upon &â  etlll having a bearing on the
ultuatlon thÂ« reserves of the local banks will
acquire fresh ascensions In considerable volume
within thÂ» next few w;eks from domestic
eources. There will be no repetition of last
winter's enormous Influx, which ran the Idle
money In New York to very high flrures, de
spite thÂ« record-breaklngr expansion In deposit
liabilities, but even moderate receipts will as
sist In making the situation more comfortable.

Chicago Grain Market.
j CHICAGO. Dec. Itâ The activity of pro- ''â 
visions was the feature on the board to-day.
The pit crowd was large, and with few excep
tions those who composed it were sellers for
profit, an operation with which they fattened
1 their purses animatedly throughout the session
Ito the detriment of the price. The liquidation
I was *Â»-t going by a hnancial report. Fluctua
tions were wide, particularly in pork. The
shipping demand was as good as ever, the hog
fui'ply small and prices at the yard firm.
Broken were free Keller* of Muy lard and hold
ers let out lines of May pork and ribs. At the
I decline the investment demand asverted lt
: M-lf. steadying the market for a time. May
I pork having dropiÂ«Â«d 20 cents, regained half
the loss, but let it go again. May pork closed
2" cents under yesterday at $10 M, May lard
124 cents down at ii ti and May rlLs 7Vj'jluc
lower at J5 50@5 62V4-
Wheat was weak the greater part of the ses
sion, because the trade thought the Govern
ment report bearish. The Boston llnanclal de-
I moralization had also a depressing effect. The
pit was quiet, after the u*ual Saturday man
ner. Tha South African news was variously
regarded and the export demand early was not
pressing. Receipt* as usual were light. May
opened %Â®Hc down to 6?QC34c and sold down
to CSTjc. Here the market received some no
port from buying against puts under which the
price had slumped, and held steady. The for
eigners, who were the principal buy
ers throughout, toward the close made
their Influence felt, and as their moves
were believed li reflect bullish deduc- i
tions from the tanked South Afri
can situation, the locals raised their bids a i
bit. and shorts did some covering. The ship
ping demand also Improved late In the session.
May advanced to O^c. at which the option
clot'eJ 4c under yesterday, with the tone of the
market rather firm.
Corn was easier, a condition due to freer
country offerings. May closed U'SJUc down
at 33c.
Nobody seemed to notice the. oats. market, so
trivial it was. May closed unchanged at 24>Ac.

NORSEMAN'S FESTIVAL.
Enjoyed by Hundreds of Little Ones
and Parents.
Five hundred children and parents filled
Saratoga Hall yesterday afternoon and
evening and spent twelve hours celebrat
ing ma fortieth annual Christmas tree
and festival of the Scandinavian Society.
The feature of the children's festival was
a liune Christmas tree, arr.und which they
ilanced and chased a more natural Santa
Claus than ever a romancer dare de
scribe, for despite the pleasant tempera
ture of the half his icicles refused to thaw
or the snow on his frown to melt. There
were hi;qe strings of presents hung from
the gallery and every little descendant of
"Par.niark" and "Ilelga" found some
thing to gladden his Juvenile heart.
After tliÂ«* children's festival the older
folk took possession of the brilliant hall
and ket>t up the festivities till long after
midnight. The following members of the
society .irmnged the festival:

the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas

section S3O of the Political Code under
which the complaint was drawn is Inop
erative and void In so far as it attempts
to make the opening and conductir.jr of a
percent ape game a misdemeanor and that
nowhere in the code or textbooks is
