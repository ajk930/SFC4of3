"Fighting in our way, we can main- ;

He inquired concerning the percent

inquiries regarding the nature and ef

RAILROAD PROJECTED
ALONG THE RIO GRANDE
Will Start at Juarez and Connect
With the National at San
Miguel.
AUSTIN, Oct. I.â Thomas Berschel. a
railroad contractor of Mexico, is here and
reports that the early building of a rail
road along the Rio Grande border in Mex
ico is almost assured. He says that a
i syndicate of American capitalists has ap
plied to the Mexican Government for a
concession for the proposed road, and it is
l understood that President Diaz looks on
I the project with favor and will cause a !
j liberal Government subsidy to be given
| for the building of the line.
Tbo promoters of the enterprise propose
: to start the road at Juarez, opposite El
, Paso, Tex., and build to San Miguel,
| Mexico, where connection will be made
I with the National, a short, isolated line,
j which runs from San Miguel to Mata
| moras, Mexico, opposite Brownsville, Tex.
i The road would be very valuable to the
' Mexican Government as a military line in
; case an emergency should arise, such as
i existed during the Garcia revolution on
the border a few years ago. The total
length of the line, should the course of
i the Rio Grande be followed, would be
i over 1000 miles.
ACCIDENT OCCURS TO
CRUISER NEW ORLEANS
Boilerheads Blow Out on the Tri^
From Stan Domingo. Much
Damage Being Done.
NEW YORK. Oct. I.â The T'nited States
cruiser New Orleans arrived this morning
from Santo Domingo < "Ity. The New Or
leans was sent to Santo Domingo to look
after American interests during the re
cent troubles. Affairs having settled
down, the New Orleans was ordered to
Tompklnsville.
The new cruiser is under command of
Captain Edwin Lnngnecker. She left
San Domingo on the morning of Sep
tember 25 and was running at full speed
In order to get here in time to take part
in the Dewey naval parade. When two
days out two of her boilerhe&da blew
out and her speed was n-.luced to a lit
tle over five miles an hour. The officers
of the cruiser were not inclined to-night
to talk about the accident to her boilers,
but it was learned that the New Orleans
is in a very crippled condition. She may
be ordered to the Brooklyn Navy Yard
for repairs.
BRIEF STRIKE ON THE
WHITE HORSE TRAMWAY
Advance of One Dollar Per Day

Hours.
i SKAGUAT, Aln ska. Sept. 27 Cvia Seat
tie, Oct. 1). â One hundred men employed
on the White Horse tramway struck Sat
urday for an advance in wages from $3
to $4 a day. Not a man went to work on
the tramway and not a pound of freight

ical time of the last few weeks of the
opr-n river, and jus? when there is the
greatest demand for freight to be hur

TUESDAY THE TIME
FOR WAR TO BEGIN
Dr a Leyds 9 Eoropeae : ; Representative of
the â  Transvaal, Tells Whee Hostili
' â¢ ties Will Be Declared,
Fort and Barracks Built by the British at Lydenburgh.
This fortress was besieged by 120") Boers during the last war, but they had no artillery, and it was stoutly defended by
two companies of the Klpht y-elghth '"onnaught Rangrers. These brave fellows fought valiantly, and on two occasions,
led by their chaplain. Father O'Malley. made successful sallies in order to obtain provisions. Finally, when the British
troops wore ordered withdrawn from the Transvaal, the rangers marched out of the beleaguered post with colors flying
and all the honors of war. The picture is from a sketch made by J. Harrington.
LONDON, Oct. 2. â The Berlin cor
respondent of the Daily News says:
According to advices from The Hague
Dr. Leyds, the European representa
tive of the Transvaal, has named
Tuesday as the day for a formal
declaration of war between the Boers
and Great Britain. There is an un
confirmed rumor in circulation here
that Queen Victoria has written
Queen Wilhelmina of the Nether
lands, deploring the turn events have
' taken in South Africa and assuring
the Dutch monarch that she has gone
; to the utmost limit of her constitu
tional rights in the endeavor to se
cure peace.
ROME, Oct. 1. â The Pope to-day
i celebrated mass for peace in South
Africa, all the cardinals being pres
i ent. Speaking to them after the cere
] mony, his Holiness expressed pro
found sorrow at the coming conflict.
LONDON. Oct. 1. â From all points
of the Transvaal, Natal and Cape
Colony come reports of continued
military activity on the frontiers,
and, while the movement of indi
vidual commands as yet do not show
concerted plans, it is evident that the
narrow strip of Natal, whose apex is
crowned with the ominously named
Mahjuba Hill, will be the center of the
coming storm.
Late yesterday the Boers established
a camp at chepers Neck, near Vryheid,
and they will mobilize a great force on
the Buffalo River to-morrow, which the
authorities at Dundee expect will move
across the border to that spot, probably
at once. It is believed that a conflict
at this point will certainly occur early
in the week.
At the same time the Boers are col
lecting a force of 2000 men under the
notorious Commandant Cronje, in the
Mulmani gold fields, near Mafeking,
where Colonel Baden-Powell is sta
tioned.
Dispatches from Tuli, Rhodesia, an
nounce that another force of burghers
is massed at Pietersburg, fifty miles
south, and that outlying parties are
posted at all the drifts along the Lim
popo River.
In the meantime Colonel Plummer's
column is moving; fifty miles nparer the i
Transvaal frontier, and has established
telephone connections to within six |
miles of Rhodesia drift, on the Lim
popo.
Enthusiastic scenes at all railway
stations have marked the advance of
the Natal volunteers.
Dispatches from Mafeking announce
that Commandant Cronje, commander i
of the Transvaal border police, crossed
the border and visited Chief Baralolga, I
apparently with the object of inciting
him to fight. The British Civil Com
missioner ordered the chief to stay and
protect the women and children, telling
him that he would not be allowed to
fight.
The Boers openly threaten to raid
Vryburg, in British Bechuanaland, as
soon as hostilities open, and the Kim
berly Advertiser complains of the
apathy of the Cape Ministry in not tak
ing steps to prevent this.
The Transvaal field cornets are tak
ing the names of colonial Boers who are
willing to cross the border in the event
of war. Not the faintest hint is -allowed
to escape as to what diplomatic com
munications, if any, are passing be
tween London and South Africa, So
far as the public are concerned, matters
have not advanced since Friday. It is
noticeable that not even the Brussels
agency of the Transvaal Government j
has yet issued Mr. Kruger's latest note j
to the press. The silence maintained
on both sides is regarded as ominous.
From South Africa the news is wholly
concerned with feverish preparations
for hostilities. Commandant General
Joubert is reported to have said that
he has 10,000 men on the Natal border
and that Commandant Cronje has 3000
on the Bechuana side. The British
camp in the vicinity of Dundee consists
of 6000 men, with twenty-four guns in
strong positions. The Orange Free
State is actively commandering. The
Transvaal Government has virtually
taken over the Netherlands railway for
CAPE TOWN. Oct. 2.â The
Boers are reported to be threat
ening Kimberly, which, however,
owing to the presence of the im
perial volunteers and the usual
guards for the miners, is con
sidered quite safe.
military purposes and Natal trains are
being turned back. Telegraph wires be
tween Natal and Johannesburg have
been cut since Friday.
According to dispatches from Pre
toria, complete chaos reigns there. The
Government ho- 1 , declh r*4 . .rÂ»*orlum
(an emergency act of legislation), au
thorizing a Government bank to sus
pend specie payments for a given
period, closed all the courts and sus
pended the English papers. It is said
that there will be nearly 30.000 burghers
along the borders by Monday night.
In Johannesburg warrants have been
issued for the arrest of some fifty
prominent Outlanders and journalists,
but all received timely warning and got
away safely.
An unconfirmed rumor has reached
Johannesburg that the fir^t portion of
the Indian contingent has arrived at
Durban, Natal.
SIGNIFICANT SENTIMENT
OF THE WARLIKE BOERS
PRETORIA, Oct. I.â While to-day
found Pretoria somewhat more quiet,
as the result of yesterday's exodus, de
tachments of burghers are moving to
ward Volksrust, the nearest station to
the Natal border. It is said that mar
tial law will be proclaimed Tuesday or
Wednesday. Already all civil proced
ures have been -stopped until further
orders, and another proclamation post
pones the sittings of the Circuit Court.
The sentiment of the Boers was signifi
cantly manifested as the trains car
rying the Pretoria contingent to the
front departed yesterday. Members of
the Volksraad. who were looking on,
exclaimed: "That is our ultimatum."
JOHANNESBURG, Oct. I.â The com
manding orders are completed, and the
burghers are ready for the field. A
large body passed through the town
yesterday afternoon.
Business has virtually ceased. The
merchants have finished barricading
their premises, and the proprietors of
the drinking saloons expect to receive
a notification to close their establish
ments to-morrow.
A party of 200 Germans has been
notified to leave, and the Irish corps,
commanded by Blake, an Irish-Ameri
can, will go early in the week.
The mines are paying $5 a day, with
food, to men who will remain.
Three trains filled with armed burgh
ers for the Natal border were this
evening reported as unable to leave
Bloomfonteln owing to a block on the
line, which has disorganized the whole
train service.
Two thousand passengers left yester
day by the morning and afternoon
trains, and nearly a thousand more by
outgoing trains last night. The Gov
ernment undertakes to provide for the
families of burghers who go to the
front.
m
MOVEMENT OF BOERS
TO NATAL FRONTIER
LONDON, Oct. Lâ lt is evident to
right that Buffalo River, the north
eastern boundary of Natal, is to be the
Potomac of the war. In view of its
strategic value, Joshua Joubert has
taken personal command of the Boer
forces there, establishing a strong line
of pickets along the river, and has
ordered the natives to drive in all the
stock. All the available burghers in
the neighborhood have been requi
sitioned, with the result that some 2000
have mobilized at Wakkerstrom, the
chief point of mobilization there.
CAPE TOWN, Oct. I.â The Cape Ar
gus publishes the following: dispatch
from Charlestown: "Commandant-Gen
eral Joubert will command the Boer
forces at Raines Nek. This is re
garded as the Transvaal's reply to the
movements of British troops. There is
considerable uneasiness here."
DUNDEE, Oct. I.â Five thousand
Boers are now concentrated in close
proximity to the frontier, and it is re
ported that they are ahout to attack
i Dundee. The most complete precau
] tions have been taken. Charlestown is
| deserted. All the women and chil
dren have left, and not more than ten
men arc now there. A locomotive is
ready to bring away the railway staff.
MAFEKING, Oct. I.â Great uneasi
ness exists here over the massing of
the Boers near the frontier. At a
1 largely .attended meeting to-day Mr.
Kiosie. a former Mayor, and other
speakers complained that the imperial
authorities were neplecting to provide
proper protection for the inhabitants,
as this border is much more exposed
, than the Natal border. The Boers,
! backed with artillery, could invade the
j town in a few hours. Many women,
i children and refugees, the speakers
pointed out, were thus placed in a po
sition of great danger. The meeting
\ unanimously adopted a resolution to
i send a telegram to the British High
Commissioner, Sir Alfred Miller, pray
ing further protection.
NEWCASTLE, Natal, Oct. 1. â The
Johannesburg mail train, due at mid
night, only arrived this morning. It
i was crowded with refugees, who re
ported that the train was sidetracked
at Standerton. Transvaal, to make way
for trains carrying burghers to the
Natal border. A body of police ar
rived here to-day from Charlestown.
Four thousand Boers are at Raid Print
and Volksrust, just beyond the Natal
j border. The Natal police are being
! called in from outlying stations, and
| the local troops and carbineers are
; mobilizing for the defense of Nevv
| castle.
VAUGHAN SAYS WAR
WOULD BE GREAT CRIME
LONDON, Oct. I.â Cardinal Herbert
"Vaughan, Archbishop of Westminster.
preaching in the pro-cathedral to-day,
! referred to the Transvaal crisis, say
, ing:
"War is still trembling: in the bal
ance, and a great responsibility rests
j upon those deputed to safeguard the
I welfare of the British nation. An un
| just or an unnecessary war would be a
great national crime, deserving divine
chastisement, because it would be an
offense against God and mankind.
Realizing the awfulness of war, the
Catholic churches in London are to
day offering prayers to Almighty God
that light and strength and courage be
given to those responsible for the in
terests of the nation, and that they
may be led to what is right and just."
TWENTY THOUSAND ARMED
BOERS ON THE BORDERS
LONDON. Oct. 2.â The special corre
spondent of the Daily Mall at Petermar-
Itzburg, Natal, describing a train journey
with a Boer command, says: "The burg
hers were hilarious and insulted the pas
sengers, and fired from the carriages at
two burghers, thus killing each other.
Their firing also broke the telegraph wire,
thus facilitating the escape of fugitives
from Johannesburg. They are now pre
venting the receipt of telegrams by order
ing their detention at Volksrust. The
Bechuanaland natives have been engaged
for a week or so In practicing witchcraft,
preparing to go on the warpath. The
ceremonies consisted of slowly torturing
to death oxen representing the Boers and
the British. These sacrifices, according
to the native reports, indicated that the
Boers would be victorious."
The special correspondent of the Morn
ing Post at Petermarltzburg says: "I un
derstand that Commandant General Jou
bert will not command in the fields. He
Intends to return to Pretoria. His hurried
visit to the front was to hold the young
Boers in check. Schalkburgher of the
executive council will command the Boers
on the Delagoa Bpy frontier."
The Daily Telegraph publishes a dis
patch from Pretoria giving the Boer view
of the situation. Its correspondent says:
"Young and old are fully determined * to
fight, whatever may be said to the con
trary. Large numbers of English and

HANNA DECLARES IT IS
AN INSULT TO DEWEY
Protests Against the Placing of the Ad
miral's Name on the List of Prospec
tive Presidential Candidates.
PITTSBURG, Oct. I.â The Post to-morrow will say: United States Sena
tor Mark Hanna says this of the possibility of Admiral Dewey for the
Presidency:
"The practice of continually placing the name of Admiral Dewey on the
list of prospective Presidential candidates is indecent. It is an insult and a
great injustice to the hero of Manila, as he himself has frequently said that
nothing in the world would induce him to run for President or any other
political office. To force upon this brave and gallant sailor the need of
again and again declaring he will not accept any political office is, In my
opinion, contemptible and places this man of integrity, stern purpose and
determination in the ranks of those shifting aspirants for political honors
who have not the stamina to resist the flattery or blandishments of political
schemers."
The Senator, when asked if Mr. McKinley would positively be a candidate
for the Presidency again, said everything pointed that way.
NEW YORK. Oct. I.â The func
tions and the receptions that
have figured so .prominently in
the daJly life of Admiral Dewey
since hi 6 arrival off Sandy Hook
last Tuesday morning have proved al
most too much for his strength. The
admiral has been under such a per
petual physical and nervous strain
that he is now almost exhausted. Sat
urday's ceremonies were the most tax
ing on his strength of any that he has
yet had to undergo, and he appeared
to-day looking pale and worn, despite
the fact that he retired early Sat
urday evening and had a good
night's rest. The admiral to-day was
too fatigued to more than remain in
his room the greater part of the time
and rest quietly.
At 10 o'clock Admiral Dewey had an
engagement to meet the Chicago
Dewey committee, and before he came
down sent a message to Mayor Carter
Harrison requesting that he be not ex
pected to shake hands with the mem
bers of the committee. The admiral
explained this request by saying that
he had had so much hand-shaking
on Saturday that his hand pained him
severely.
Admiral Dewey rose early this morn
ing, however, sending for a cup of tea
at 6 o'clock. Shortly after he ordered
a light breakfast, which was sent to his
apartments, and which he ate alone.
When the admiral had finished his
breakfast he sent for his private physi
cian. Dr. Percy, who was closeted with
him for a few minutes. Admiral Dewey
later called on the Members of his fam
ily and his relatives and chatted with
(hem for fully an hour. He received
Mayor Van Wyck at 9 o'clock. Mayor
Van Wyck acted as an escort to the
admiral throughout the day. He was
present in the admiral's room, he es
corted him down to the parlor, where
the Chicago delegation was to be re
ceived, and was the only representa
tive of the city In caring for its gal
lant guest.
There were many callers at the Wal
dorf-Astoria who wished to send cards
to Admiral Dewey. but few were per
mitted to do so, the admiral's fatigue
being given as the reason.
The del' 'on from Philadelphia,
headed by Mayor Samuel H. Ashbridge,
arrived early in the day, slipped into a
parlor on the Thirty-third street side of
the hotel, and were disposed of in a
very few minutes. The admiral came
in, said "good morning" to all and then
greeted Mayor Ashbridge. who lost r.o
time in telling just what they were
there for. He handed the admiral an
album containing the resolutions pass
ed by the Philadelphia City Council, ex
tending the invitation officially and of
fering the freedom of the city. Mayor
Ashbridge said: "We know that you
have many engagements and we do not
ask you to come at any special time.
We can only assure yoti that when you
do come you will receive a most hearty
welcome."
"I feel very much honored," replied
the admiral, "to receive the invitation.
I will go to Phil -ielphia. but I cannot
say now when I ill be there, although
I would be glad '.o be able to do so."
Before the applause could get a fair
start he bowed himself out. The Phila
delphians were gratified at the result
of their visit and went away satisfied
that they would some day welcome him
in the Quaker City.
At 9:15 Mayor Carter Harrison, ac
companied by Zina R. Carter, one of
the committeemen, arrived at the ho
tel. The other members of the com
mittee came straggling in, and at 9:50
they were all present. The doors of
the" big ballroom on the Waldorf side
were then thrown open, and the mem
bers of the committee, headed by
Mayor Harrison, entered the room.
Mayor Harrison then said to the com
mittee:
You all know that Admiral Dewey is a
modest man, and a man who dislikes
speeches, and who has but little patience
with the' American habit of handshaking.
He has had so many people to shake
hands with since he arrived in this hos
pitable city that his hands and arms are
giving out". He has just now sent word
to me to ask that at the conclusion of
the invitatton for him to visit our city
there be no attempt on the part of the
committee to shake hands with him. I
know you would all be glad to have him
take your hand, but I am certain you
must appreciate the situation, and I ask
as a personal favor that you honor his
request To not do so might prejudice
him against Chicago, and we are here for
the purpose of asking him to visit us.
Wait until we get him in our own city,
then we will take chances on shaKlng
hands with him.
Promptly at 10 o'clock Admiral
Dewey came into the room. He wore a
civilian suit, with frock coat and dark
trousers, and carried no hat. The in
stant he appeared there was a burst
of applause. He saluted and said:
'â¢Good morning, all."
Admiral Dewey met Mayor Harrison
as he advanced with a cordial greeting.
Mayor Harrison said:
Admiral Dewey. I appreciate your dis
like for set speeches, and have therefore
none to make. I only want to say that I
thank you in behalf of the Chicago com
mittee for the honor done us by your
receiving us here this morning. It is an
honor second to none in the land. And
now I wish to extend to you, on behalf
of the committee and on behalf of the
city of Chicago, an invitation to come to

Admiral Dewey received the invita
tion that Mayor Harrison extended to
him. He had the invitation in his hand,
and turned its pages. As he continued
to turn over the leaves he glanced â  up
and said:
Mr. Mayor and members of the com
mittee Vl c honor is mine. I consider it
a *. r 1 at honor to be waited upon by such
a delegation as this and I consider it a

Chicago. It is a great city, and during

Cnicagoans.
As Admiral Dewey eoncluT 1 there
was a moment's pause. Each of the
two principals seemed to hesitate. At
that instant some one in the front of
the crowd stepped forward to shake
hands with the admiral. Mayor Har
rison quickly interposed himself be
tween the admiral and the enthusiastic
Westerner, saying, a he placed his
hand on the maiss shoulder, "Don't do
that, please; don't, ask the admiral to
shake hands this morning."
The man stepped back into the
crowd. Admiral Dewey seemed much
embarrassed by the incident, and he
first held out his hand and then with
drew it. Mayor Van Wyck then seized
the opportunity thus offered to get
away, and, placing his hand under the
elbow of Admiral Dewey's right arm,
escorted him out through the door. As
Admiral Dewey was leaving the room
there was a burst of applause, and he
turned and waved a salute with his
hand as he disappeared behind a heavy
curtain.
Mayor Harrison expressed himself as
well pleased with the reception given
him and the committee. When asked
if he thought Admiral Dewey would
go to Chicago he looked surprised and
said: "Go? Of course he will. Didn't
he say he would go some time. That's
all we care forâ to get his promise to
go whenever he pleased."
Ferdinand W. Peck. United States
Commissioner to the Paris Exposition,
was among the Chicagoans to-day, and
said: "When Admiral Dewey goes to
Chicago he can have the whole town,
the county and the State."
The corridors of the Waldorf-As
toria were thronged all day with peo
ple anxious to catch even a glimpse of
the great admiral. Early in the morn
ing they began to come in, and they
were coming and going all day. But
none of them were given the pleasure
of seeing Dewey. He was not down in
the corridors of the hotel at any time.
When he was escorted to the room in
which he met the Chicago delegation he
was taken down a private stairway,
and returned the same way. In every
conceivable manner his movements
were guarded to keep the curious crowd
from getting near him.
Admiral Dewey will leave the Wal
dorf-Astoria to-morrow at 12:15 o'clock
on his journey to Washington. The
trip from Jersey City to Washington
will be made on the most elaborate spe
cial train ever run by the Pennsyl
vania road. Admiral Dewey's per
sonal party will consist of himself, his
son, George B. Dewey; his brother,
Charles Dewey, and wife; Captain
Lamberton and wife. Flag Lieutenant
Brumby and Lieutenant Caldwell. A
special car will be provided for the ad
miral. In addition the following naval
officers, as special guests, will also ac
company the party: Rear Admirals
Sampson, Schley, Philip and Casey,
Captains C. D. Sigsbee and Robley D.
Evans, Commander E. P. Wood and
Ensign F. L. Bennett. General Miles
will also be in the party.
The card clerk at the office sent up
stairs to Admiral Dewey's apartments
several hundred cards and refused to
send up nearly as many more. No one
waH permitted to disturb the admiral.
Even his relatives, not excepting his
brother Charles, kept away, hoping
that their absence from his side would
have some weight with the outsiders
and keep everybody away. Along about
4 o'clock a party of three turned up at
the desk and handed three cards to the
clerk. Upon them were Inscribed the
names of Captain W. H. Reeder, U. S.
N.; Captain George C. Reiter, U. S. N.,
and Charles Cramp of Philadelphia.
The admiral invited them 'up and they
remained with him twenty minutes.
Captain Reeder, who is the command
ant of St. Mary's Navy-yard, said that
they were all old friends of the admiral.
At 7 o'clock the admiral dined with
his brother Charles and wife, his son.2
BATTLE OF OFFICERS
WITH TWO TRAMPS
John Leonard and Herbert Glover, two
tramps arrested and lodged In the wooden
calaboose at Orange on Thursday night,
opened fire on Constable W. T. Bush and
Night Watchman James Murray, who
opened the door of the pen some hours
later to take the men to the County. Jail
at Santa Ana.
Both officers returned the fire, and after
nine shots had been exchanged Murray
â  mortally wounded one of the men and the
other, surrendered. Both prisoners were
brought to Santa Ana, where the wound
ed man died. The dead man Is Herbert
Glover, 23 years of age. who has an uncle,
â¢ L. S. Glover, In business in San Diego.
â¢' The r Other. John Leonard, is a cowboy
â¢ from Arizona, and they were part of a
â¢ ' pang that recently burglarized a hard
ware store In San Bernardino and got
â¢ . considerable plunder.
â  '"..> An inquest held on Glover's body exon

â ;My brother told us to-day," said
Charles Dewey later In the day. "that
he <3!d not begin fully to appreciate the
extent and nature of his reception hore
until he aliprht'-d at the Battery yester

Of course, he saw the people lining the
river during the naval parade, but he
war not close enough to catch their ex

FOR WAR TO BEGIN

The highest Government official! throw
all the blame of hostilities on the British

have done so. they say. had there been a

being unable to get food. The men were
drenched with the rain in the open trucks.
British and Dutch were being com
mand. when I left and their goods
were being seised. So far as I can learn
there are undoubtedly at least 20,000 armed
Boer*, well horsed, at different poll on
the border, especially in the direction of
Natal. They boast of their intention of
invading Natal on Wednesday next and
of sweeping the British into the sea. It
certainly looks as though Natal would be
invaded in force. The burghers seem
sturdy folk. They are dressed in a va
riety "<. i' costumes. The chief defect dis
cernible is the large number of officials
of Inferior physique who accompany the,
troops. These ire likely to prove a source
of weakness. From Johannesburg to
Volksrust the greatest enthusiasm seemed
to prevail. It is estimated that 20,000
Boers, with field guns, now command all
the heights within a fifteen-mile radius
from Charlcstown."
The Pretoria correspondent of the Daily
Chronicle, telegraphing at noon Sunday,
says :
"I have seen the leading members of the
executive of the Transvaal, who desire,
through the Daily Chronicle, at the last
moment, to ask what the two kindred
nations are going to fight about. They
point to the fact that a large number of
Outlanders of all nationalities are arming
in defense of the republic. They point to
the unanimity of ' feeling in the Orange
Free State, which, they say, should make
England pause. They aim at a union with
England like that of Scotland, not Ire
land, and they urge that it will be a war
like the war which lost England her
American colonies and that It will bene
fit neither the English nor the capitalists.
The greatest excitement prevails here.
Thirty-six trains with armed burghers
were dispatched Saturday amid terribly
pathetic scenes. * Thousands of refugees,
white. Malays and Kaffirs, have gone to
the Cape in open trucks. Strict orders
have been issued to the Boer commanders
on the frontier to restrain their men from
firing. The rains have begun to fall and
plenty of forage will soon be obtainable."

HEMMED IN BY
A FOREST FIRE
Narrow Escape of Two
San Diego Men.
â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO. Oct. I.â Fletcher Court
ney and George H*>ylmann, young men
of this city, have returned from Falomar
Mountain, in the northern part of the
county, with a tale of hardship. They
were out on a prospecting trip and were
encamped on the Bouthern side of the
mountain when the great forest fire of a
few days ago raged over the summit of
the mountain, destroying hundreds of
acre* ' : largi pine and oak trees, some of
the pines being nearly 100 feet In height.
Although several miles from the tire,
the young men could plainly see the
names in the sky and hear the roaring
made by the conflagration, and they left
ramp and went up to get a better view of
the s; f-ctacle. When about to return
Courtney and Heylmann discovered that
the fire had crept around them and was
advancing from all sides and threatening
to ir, mate them. The apparent impossi
bility of escape almost paralyzed the
young men, ana, believing that they were
ed, an agreement was made to shoot
themselves with the guns they carried
rather than be burned to death. Before
the tire reached them, however, their bet
t.r Judgment returned and they decided
to cover their heads with their coats and
make an attempt to escape through the
burning trees. Courtney stumbled on a
rock before going far and burned his
hands severely pn the blazing branches
which hud fallen to the ground.
When the two succeeded in reaching the
op.n they discovered that their camp had
been swept over by the tire, destroying
all their possessions. They were compelled
to walk several miles down the mountain
for food and to Escondido, a distance of
twenty miles, before they could procure
transportation to this city.

Punished for Surrendering.
MADRID, Oct. I.â The supreme council
of war has ordered that General Jauden
be placed on the reserve list for the sur
render of Manila to. Admiral Dewey and
General Merritt
Tanner the Faster Outdone.
It Is the prevailing impression, fostered
by the practices of men like Succi and Dr.
Tanner, that in order to endure a long
fast a man must absolutely refrain from
physical exercise and devote his whole
time to caring for himself. Milton Rath
bun a merchant of Mount Vernon, N. V.,
has proved that this is a fallacy, so far
as it applies to his own case at least.
He recently went twenty-eight days with
out nourishment without letting up for
a moment on the daily routine of his
business. Mr. Rathbun Is f>2 years of age,
a prosperous and wealthy man, with noth
ing unusual or cranky In his make-up or
ways of life. He fasted simply because
he wanted to reduce his weight, fearing
that Its gradual increase might bring on
apoplexy. He succeeded in his efforts. He
wi tghed 210 pounds when he stopped eat
ing; when he resumed at the end of twen
ty-eight days he tipped the scale at 168
pounds â a loss of forty-two pounds of
flesh. A singular fact in Mr. Rathbun'a
experience was that after the first twentjr
four hours he experienced no sense of
hunger at all, and had no unpleasant
sensations of any kind. He slept and
worked in the regular way, his mind
clear and his strength unabated to the
end. He drank copiously of water dur
ing the period, but took nothing else.
When ho began to eat again he took only
a little food at first, increasing the
amount gradually until, within a few
days, he was back to his former routine
of diet. Mr. Rathbun holds to the theory
that the average man eats far more than
necessary for his health or comfort, and
that an occasional period of absolute ab
stention from food for several days is
good for the system. This theory cer
tainly has the support of Mr. Rathbun's
own practice.â Leslie's Weekly.

DISAPPEARING
Are the Picturesque Woodsmen of
Pennsylvania.
One r.f thp most Interesting and pictur
esque types known to backwoods life, the
old-tlnri" lumberman and woodchopper of
the Alkghnnlos. Is now almost n thing of
the post. At the present day the number
of men engaged in that healthful but ar
duous occupation is small compared with
the thousands thai Labored in the f'me for
ests of a quarter of a century ago. The
fine forests of Pennsylvania are thrni
selves only a memory.
The genuine old-time woodsman of the
Allegheny spread of waters cannot be
mistaken. He will be seen In midwinter
always wearing a fur cap, which Is, more
than likely, some long-preserved trophy
of his own rifle or trap. He wears no
coat or waistcoat, hi* body and chest be
ing covered by a heavy flannel or wooli n
shirtâ not the gorgeously colored gar
ments of the later-day lumberman, but
good, old-fashioned stuff, such as his
rather used to wear. Trousers of some
warm woolen goods cover his legs. The
new order of woodsmen wear their trous
ers tucked Into a long pair of stockings.
Th^se stockings are often as gorgeous In
varied color as the shirt or jneket h<
affi its, ami their tops ;tre drawn snug to
the leg by a puckering string* the en. is
of the string sometinv â¢Â» pnding in fancy
tassels. They wear "num" slio<-.Â«. The
old-time woodsman's father wore cowhide
boots well greased with tallow, and with
no stockings between ib-ir leather and his
feet; so his sons, or most of them, wear
cowhide boots, greased with tallow, and
no stockings, and declare that thus clad
their ffet are kept warmer than by the
bundling of heavy stockings. The old
timer will defy any one to remember an
instance of any one's feet ever having
been frosted when dressed on the cowhide
boot, no stocking plan. These fast-disap
pearing specimens of the days "when
lumberin' was lumberin' nnd not playln'
circus" also scorn suspenders, or "gal
luses," as they call them.
"A feller can't have his shoulders all
clawed up if he wants to swing an ax or
pull a raft oar," is the rule of these for
est craftsmen.
Clad thus the woodsman Is ready for a
shooting match, a dog fight, a bear hunt,
a log chopping or a mourner meeting. The
mourner meeting Is the backwoods revi
val, conducted usually by some strap
ping. !usty lunged preacher, and generally
at the district schoolhouse. Everybody
within a circuit of five or six miles at
tends the mourner meetings, and fre
quently a majority of the congregation
join the mourners before the revival is
over. But the steadfastness of the back
woods convert Is evidently not to be de
pended upon, for mourners of one winter
are, to a great extent, the mourners of
the next. This doesn't seem to be looked
upon as anything to be unfavorably com
mented upon; on the contrary, some re
gard it as a very commendable action, as
witness the boast of one old-time woods
man:
"I stand high in this here deestrlct, and
I ought to. I been a mourner ev'ry winter
at the mourner meetln's fer bettef'n forty
year."
As a rule these untutored woodsmen are
honest and generous, although always'
boisterous, and it is to be regretted that
they are being replaced by an element so
different in all respects, for to their
sturdy and aggressive character is due
more than to any one thing, the place
Western Pennsylvania enjoys In the esti
mation of the entire country.â New York

Science Crowds Out Pallbearers.
The latest novelty in the line of funeral
equipments has just been introduced into
Portland. Tt Is in the nature of a casket
lowering device, which does away with
the pallbearers lowering the body into the
grave. By this new invention the casket
is brought from the hearse and placed on
the device, which is automatic in its op
eration, and at the proper time the un
dertaker touches a spring and the casket
is, by invisible means, lowered quietly
into the grave. Thu* does science smooth
our passage to the cold and silent tomb.â

Large Contract With the Government
for Carrying Mail.
SANTA BARBARA, Oct. I.â Norman Wines, the well-known Gov
ernment mail contractor and stage-line owner, dropped dead this Hom

SCOTSMAN'S CREW
UNDER ARREST
Are Caught Laden With
Their Plunder.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTREAL, Oct. I.â When the steamer
Montfort reached this port to-day police
j officers arrested twenty-three members of
the Scotsman's crew, laden with plunder.
Twenty officers on the wharf awaited the
vessel's arrival. The policemen were kept
concealed until the gangways were along
! side, when they suddenly swarmed on
board and in a second had rounded up the
Scotsman's crew. It was done so quickly !
that the men had no opportunity of ridding
themselves of any traces of guilt. Half !
a dozen patrol wagons were waiting '
alongside and into these the sailors were j
hustled, amid the jeers and hisses of a !
largo crowd Which had gathered.
"Throw them into the river: ' was the ;
cry that went up.' Had it not been for i
the presence of the police the threat i
â¢would probably have been carried into j
effect. The men were taken to the Central i
Police Station and stripped. When the ;
search was ended there remained not the '
slightest doubt of pillage and violence |
told by the unlucky passengers of the !
Scotsman.
Among the goods found were jewelry j
of every kind, ladies' dresnes. Bilks and I
! satins, men's wearing apparel and private
papers were even included in the prey.
The will of Mr. defter was taken from
one man. The value of the articles re
covered is placed at $3000.
The Grecian came in about noon and ;
from her the police took nine cattlemen j
who were upon the Scotsman. Upon one
man only was anything of an incriminat
â  Ing nature found.
It is given as a reason why more stolen I
jewelry was not found on the sailors from i
the Grecian that when the ship touched
at Quebec a half-dozen policemen In uni- i
i form boarded her, and that the thieves j
i took alarm and threw their plunder over- !
! board. A diver Is to be sent down In the
morning to search the bottom where the :
j ship lay.
The list of the Scotsman's dead re
j mained unchanged at 11 o'clock to-night. ;
' Rev. Dr. Chalmers, the Congregational ;
! missionary of Hongkong, who was re- j
; ported missing last evening, has been lo
i cated.
He is on board the Dominion line
steamer Ottoman, which arrived at Que
bec this morning, bringing Dr. Chalmers,
i four other passengers and twenty-eight i
of the Scotsman's crew. The captain, the
chief and second and fourth officers still
remain by the ship, and it is supposed
that all the passengers and crew have
been taken off Change Island.
QUEENSTOWN, Oct. 1. â Four passen
gers and twenty-five of the crew of the
British steamer Scotsman, which was
: wrecked September 21 in the Straits of
i Belle Isle while bound from Liverpool to
Montreal, were landed here yesterday by
; the British eteamer Monterey.
USE FOR OLD GLOVES.
Attractive Things Can Be Made Out
of Them.
â \Vhat a problem it is to know what to
:do with our old gloves. Some girls have
boxes and packages of thorn stowed away.
They get them out only now and again,
look at them, think over all the good
times they had when* wearing them at
dances, dinners, eu\, worulcr if the gloves
could possibly be cleaned again, then fold
i them awayâ still wonderingâ and say:
I "They are of no use to any one, and yet
! I hate to throw them away; they may
j come in for something some day."
One girl has found use tor them at last,
and this is not one or the "swell" girls
with dozens and dozen* of long gloves to
match every evening gown, but a girl who
had few fairs and who had to be very
careful of them, too, to make them last
the season out.
When her eyes fell upon a hopeless
looking heap of dirty glovesâ white and
pale colorsâ an Inspiration came to her. "I
shall cut off the hands ami make some
thing out of the rent of the kid." She
carefully ripped the seams of the upper
I parts, "cleaned thorn thoroughly with
! naphtha, gasoline and magnesia, accord
i ing to how they were soiled, and then she
I set to work.
Out of the long partÃ of a pair of pale
pink gants de suede she made a beautiful
1 picture frame simply by pasting the kid
over a cardtxjard frame (the paste only
being put on the back). A card case of
pearl gray kid is another of the protty
things she has made. It is entirely coy
] ered with the kid. sewed neatly together
on the edges, which are finished with
small steel beads.
On the outside is a monogram, em
broidered in steel beads, done, of course,
before the case was covered. Still an
other exceedingly pretty tiling is a book
cover or photograph case.
This she made of two or three pairs of
I pale yellow gants de suede. The piece*
were "too narrow to go the entire width,
so she cut them into strips of equal size,
and when joined she sewed on narrow
gold braid. The whole was bound with
the same and the book tied In with a
band of corn colored satin ribbon.
There seems to be no end to the list of
attractive things she. devises. There are
â  button bags lined with silk and feath'or
stltched on the seams: tobacco pouches
and opera-glass bags done in the Â«ame
way; card cases and spool cases. Some
she has painted or embroidered; others
she has simply finished off with a bit of
ribbon. And the hands of the gloves out
of which all these pretty things were
made were thrown away? Not at all.
She cut off the tops of the fingers and
gave them to the housemaid to wear when
she cleaned her fireplaces or her brasses
and silver, and she kept some of them to
wear herself when polishing up her own
particular silver trinkets.
Too Many Dogs in Kansas.
Kansas has suffered in past years from
an overproduction of grasshoppers and
Populists. It is now afflicted, it appears,
with a surplusage of dogs. It is long on
dogs, but short on sheep. The secretary
of the Kansas Agricultural Society de
plores this fact in a recent report. He
shows that there are but 200,000 sheep in
the State, while the number of dogs is
176.000. Two years ago the sheep out
numbered the dogs by 30 per cent, while
last year this percentage was reduced to
17. In one county there were 909 dogs to
each sheep, and in twelve selected coun
ties there were 209 dogs to each sheep. If
a similar investigation were made in other
States we doubt not that some of them
would show an equal disproportion of
dogs and sheep. But it is not a good sign
anywhere. Prosperity for the farmer
does not lie along the way of an increase
in the dog crop.â Leslie's Weekly.

PLAN TO DEPOSE
THE EMPEROR
Unfortunate Ruler of
China Is Doomed.
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. 1.-The steamer
Olympia reached here this afternoon from
Yokohama. A dispatch from Peking to
the North China Daily News says that
arrangements for the dethronement of
the unfortunate Emperor Kuang Hsu are
proceeding apace. The Empress Dowager's
choice has definitely fallen upon Pu
Tsuan, the 9-year-old son of Duke Tsai
Lan. to succeed Kuans Hsu as Emperor
of China. This imperial candidate can
only speak the Manchu dialect, and
knows no Chinese.
Kuang Hsu has already been urged to
draw up a memorial to the Empress
Dowager asking to be allowed to resign
his throne owing to his chronic illness.
Pretence will be made by the Empress
Dowager to refuse acceptance of the res
ignation and to consider the matter
again. This will be done three times,
and at the third time the resignation is
to be accepted, as showing the Emperor
1 tally anxious to resign.
The troops of Prince Ching and Jung
Lv will be under arms on the occasion of
the dethronement in case something un
toward should happen. Duke Tsai Lan is
a close friend of Prince Ching. and thore
are doubts whether the Jung Lv party
will be satisfied at this further strength
ening of the Ching faction by the ap
pointment of the new Emperor. There
are rumors that perhaps Russia will have
something to say before the dethronement
takes place, as Chinese officials in Fang
tlen have recently reported that Russia
is preparing to send a large force to Pe
king in a few days.
INFLUENCE
Of a Dream Prevented a Mother From
Hiring a Nurse.
It was that absorbing topic, the
stolen baby, Marion Clarke. So inter
ested were the passengers of a crowded
Broadway car that not a few rode past
their destination.
"It happened when Daisy was a
baby," said the big, florid woman,
while the blushes of the beaatiful girl
at her side indicated that she was
Daisy.
"I dreamed one night that she was
stolen from me by a woman. After
long search â the suspense was agoniz
ing â I found her in a big house which
had a peculiar green door and a brass
knocker. The door opened into a little
shoe shop, where a cobbler was at his
bench. The dream was so vivid that I
awakened in a perspiration, and was
hysterical for some time. Long after
the dream had passed from my mind
I had need for a nursegirl. I went to
an intelligence office and was favorably
impressed by a young woman. I did
not give her my address, but told her
I would look up her references, and if
they were satisfactory I would send for
her. The references were all that could
be desired, but instead of writing to
her, as I promised, something told me
to go and see her. I obeyed the impulse.
After changing cars several times I
found myself in an obscure part of
Boston, face to face with the identical
green door and knocker that I had seen
in my dream. Trembling, I knocked.
The door opened into a shoe shop with
a cobbler at his bench. The young
woman I had seen in the intelligence
office came forward to meet me as I
stared at her.
"'I don't want you,' I blurted out.
and, turning, fled from the house.
'"I never could tell how I reached
home, but for months after I never suf
fered Daisy to leave my sight, so fear
ful was I that the woman would find
out where we lived and steal the child
from me."
"Curious!" cried her companions,
while the countenances of the listeners
reflected relief that Daisy had escaped
the clutches of the kidnapers. â New
York Tribune.
Admits His Own Impeachment.
A story is told of two prominent Chi
cago lawyers who several years ago
were regarded as being among the
brightest lawyers the State had pro
duced for a long time. There was great
rivalry between these men, and one day
they were having a heated argument on
the steps of the State House at Spring
field.
"I'll agree to leave it to the first man
we meet," said one of the wrangling
lawyers, fiercely.
"AH right, and that will settle it once
for all â ah, here is Charlie . We'll
leave it to him."
"Charlie," as the man spoken of ap
proached within hearing distance, "we
want you to decide who is the best law
yer in Illinois. We agree to abide by
your decision."
"Well," replied "Charlie," himself an
old practitioner, and well known in the
capital city, "I plead guilty to being the
best lawyer in the State myself.
Both men gasped in astonishment at
his assurance.
"Why, Charlie, how can it be
proved?" inquired the first of the two
Chicagoans.
"You don't have to prove it," replied
the Springfield man; "I admit it, don't
I?"â Chicago Journal.
Betrayed by His Fingers.
A rich American residing in the St.
George's quarter, in Paris, has been for
some time past the victim of systematic
thefts. Bank notes and money -not left
under lock and key disappeared regularly.
M. Cornette, the Commissary of Police,
was informed of the robberies. He found
it would be impossible to keep an effective
watch on the bedroom where the thefts
occurred, but he adopted a stratagem
which turned out successfully. A small
vial containing a mixture of picric acid
and fuschine was placed in a metal case
for holding gold and a few napoleons
were placed on top. In order to get nut
the gold the metal case had to be held up
side down, and then, of course, the chem
ical preparation would run out and stain
the thief's hands a bright and indelible
yellow. As soon as some of the gold was
missed M. Cornette summoned all the
servants to his presence. The valet's fin
gers betrayed him. Realizing the useless
ness of denying when caught yellow-hand
ed, he confessed, and was duly locked up.

D. Evans, U. S. N., who will be in
charge of the course during the yacht
races the coming week, to-day gave out
! the statement concerning the fleet of
j excursion boats that will follow the
i racers over the course. He said that
I his orders would be imperative, that no
i boat could be allowed to run outside of
j the course designated by the stake
j boats.
"I have gone to considerable trouble
in this matter," said Captain Evans,
| "and I have received orders which I
must follow. I appeal to the masters
of vessels not to crowd ahead or run
! ahead of the wind. A swash from a
! large excursion boat will greatly em
: barrass the sailing of the yachts and it
is to this end that I hope to have the
! rules in detail followed. I have ar-
I ranged for guide boats, and from them
| they can get their course.
"I will regret very deeply the neces
-1 sity of enforcing my powers in this re
! spect, but I do say most emphatically
that any boat that is run outside the
lines established for them, will be im-
mediately sent hack to New York in
charge of a revenue officer. This will
mean the conceling of any license fhit
the master may have and necessarily
will he of great detriment to them."
Captain Evans said that to-morrow
he would send a copy of the rules of the
yacht club as well as the Government
laws on this subject to the master of
each vessel.
Captain Evans will go on the revenue
cutter Manning Tuesday and will be in
the center of the guide ships.
ACTIVE VOLCANO
ON UNGA ISLAND
Phenomena Witnessed
by Harry Lee.
Sr.ecia.l Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Oct. I.â Harry Lee of Chi
cago has returned from his Becond explor
ing trip along the southern and western
coasts of Alaska, where he has gathered
nearly a complete collection of Alaskan
animals and birds for his private museum.
.He brings news that at least three vol
canoes have been in eruption this sum
mer in Western Alaska, and are still sup
posed to be active. These are the volca
no on Unga Island and two others known I
to the natives as Pavloff and Accutan. j
The latter volcanoes are located west of
Mount f^t. Ellas and north of Cooks Inlet, i
It is possible that one of these was the !
volcano reported to be in eruption several i
days ago by Frank Wilts of Kentucky, |
who spoke of it as Mount Logan.
The natives of Kenai peninsula and \
Cooks.lnlet were awe stricken by the phe- '<â 
nomena. The volcano on Unga Island is j
known to have thrown out lava, compell
ing miners and prospectors working at ,
its base to move back.
Accompanied by sportsmen from New
York, Philadelphia and Chicago, Lee will j
go north next year to hunt musk ox and '
Polar bear. These will complete his <ol- i
lection of the large game of North Amer- !
ica. The party will go up the Mackenzie 1
River, and later visit islands in the Arc
tic Ocean and Siberia.
SAYS THE ISTHMIAN
CANAL WILL BE BUILT
Return of Members of the Commis-
sion Who Are to Select a
Feasible Route.
NEW YORK. Oct. I.â Rear Admiral
Walker. Colonel Peter C. Ilalns, Professor
William H. Burr of Columbia College and
Alfred Noble, members of a sub-commit
tee of the commission appointed to report
on a feasible route for a canal across the
Isthmus of Panama, arrived here to-dai'.
on the American line steamer New York.
Rear Admiral Walker, chairman of the
committee, paid that the canal would cer
tainly be Ijuilt, for the project of an
isthmian waterway was entirely feasible.
He said that ho must defer discussing the
when and how of it until after the com
mission had made its final report.
Admiral Walker and his associates of
the sub-committee sailed from here on
August 9 on the St. Louis. Lieutenant
Colonel Oswald A. Ernst, who accompa
nied them on the other side, is still in
Europe. The sub-committee spent about
a month in Paris, where it examined all
records relating to the Panama canal. It
then visited the Ki. 1 canal, Xorth Sle;i
canal, and crossing the channel made Fan
examination of the great Manchester snip
canal. All appliances and locks of canals
were examined.
Rear Admiral Walker said that the com
mittee had seen electricity applied to new
uses in the management of locks. All in
formation with regard to canals will
prove very useful to the commission.
Rear Admiral Walker upon his arrival
drove to the T'niversity Club, and in the
afternoon started on his way to Washing
ton. The committee will spend a few
weeks at the national capital and then
go to the isthmus, where it will spend the
winter.
EXPLORERS FIND RICH
NEW GOLD FIELDS
Located in the Ungavaland District,
a Desolate Region on the Shore
of Hudson Bay.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. I.â The Times
publishes a letter from a correspondent
at Fort Francis. Ontario, under date of
September 20. which says:
"Ungavaland, ;i region as desolate and
unknown as the Klondike was four years
ago, has just bet-n penetrated by a p.trtv
of prospectors, headed by a newspaper
man of this region, and consisting for the
most part of men representing a wealthy
Boston syndicate. From their reports anil
from statements made by a member of
fn<- Canadian Geological Survey, whom i
they found in that region, they have run!
into a new Klondike, and one richer in
diversified minerals, of larger extent and !
easy to reach, compared to the ice des
erts of the Yukon.
About a year ago J. Osborn, editor of
a newspaper of this region, became the j
possessor of a diary that had been the i
records of an old employe of the Hudson
Bay Company. He was astonished to find
it told circumstantially of the discovery
of mineral deposits on the eastern shores
of Hudson Buy. not far from the Whale
River, in what is known as Ungavaland,
one of the last remaining unexplored
tracts of the North American continent.
Mr. Osborn had no difficulty in inducing '
Boston capitalists to provide the funds to
equip an expedition to explore for the !
mineral fields.
Before returning the party found large :
and valuable deposits of gold, silver, cop- â¢
per. iron, anthracite and lignite, gypsum
and cinnabar. On what tracts the party
discovered mineral th^y have now filed
claims at the Dominion offices in Ottawa.

FINE IMPOSED ON
CAPTAIN DERMOTT
Failed to Procure a Proper Bill of
Health for His Vessel
in China.
TACOMA, Oct. I.â Captain Dermott, the
venerable skipper of the barkentine J. M.
Griffiths and father of Maxine Elliott, ia
in trouble as the result of misstatements
made to him by officials at New Chwang,
China, whence the Griffiths arrived sev
eral days ago.
When he applied for a bill of health at
New Chwang the officials gave him a cer
tificate which they declared was all he
needed, charging him $11 therefor. They
were so emphatic that Dermott failed to
secure a consular bill of health. Arriving
at Port 'fownsend the customs officers
lined the vessel $5000 for lack of a consular
certificate. The fine will be paid under
protest and an appeal taken.
AMERICAN SPIRIT.
Henry W. Rolfe of Chicago Lectures
at Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 1.- i
Professor Henry W. Rolfe of Chicago Uni
versity spoke in the chapel this morning,
his topic being "The American Spirit."
Throughout his discourse Professor Rolfe
maintained that, there was an American
spirit; that this spirit was characterised
by the people in peace more than in war.
"The literature of America." he said, "is
characteristic of her people, and is em
bodied in the writing of feuch men as Em
erson and Hawthorneâ simple, direct and
free from tradition. Americans are as a
rule inclined too much toward boasting.
When we really find ourselves we will be
too busy to wonder what the world thinks
of us. The American spirit is relatively
unchangeable, and makes democracy dif
ferent here from what it is anywhere else.
As soon as class will sympathize with
class the strife between labor and capital
will cease and perfect harmony ensue.
There is something that we may call the
American spirit, and something that we
may be proud of. Let us feel that this
spirit imposes on us an obligation not only
to think but aiso to actâ to consider the
rights of man with man. labor with cap
ital, the duty of stronger nations towjird
the weaker. The Golden Rule is applied
by putting one's self in another"? place
and looking at the facts of the case with
out prejudice."

FESTIVAL .' OBSERVED - IN ALL
CATHOLIC CHURCHES.
St. Francis Church Will Celebrate
Its Golden Anniversary Next
Sunday â Special Services
During the Week.
The feast of the Most Holy Rosary was
celebrated by the Catholic churches
throughout the city yesterday. The
month of October is -dedicated by nio
church to the blessed virgin.' and the
first Sunday in that month is celebrated
by this form of devotion.
(The services wore especially splendid at
the Church 6f St. Dominic, Stein er and
Bush streets, for it was to St. Dominie
that t lie blessed virgin Mary revealed ihe
devotion of the holy rosary .and com
manded him t*> preach it throughout the
world. An hence, the rosary Das ever
been the special herituge of the Domini
can Order. The seating capacity of the
lofty edifice was taxed to its utmost, even
ttaa aisles being packed with worshipers.
The pillars of the sarvru.iry and the altar
wore beautifully decorated.
'The morning sermon was delivered by
the Rev. Father Heagan. The father
spoke eloquently on the holy rosary and
the significance of the festival as the
peculiar devoiion sacred to the virgin
Mary. He said:
"All Catholics at the mention of her
name glow with love; their souls thrill
with ardor. This is so because of her
virtues and prerogatives. She has fore
told that all nations shall eail her blessed.
She is worthy of this benediction. The
reason of all the grandeurs which aro
hers, is that she is the mother of God.
Devotion to the rosary guides us over
the sea of life to the haven of God."
The music, under thr direction of
Franklin Palmer, was grand and inspir
ing. The offertory solo. "Invocation."
sung by Mr. Wanrell, was exceptionally
fine. During tin- services Mr. Palmer
rendered various selections on the organ
from Wldor, Guilmont, Detheir and Bach.
At the conclusion of the services roses
were blessed mil distributed to the entire
congregation. Then, preceded by the
choir singing the responses and the so
dalities, the congregation marched in
solemn procession round the gray stone
church, chanting blessings on the roses.
At the Church of St. Francis the Rpv
Father McDonald, the assistant pastor
preached on the "Blessed Virgin." A
large congregation was present and gave
the speaker close attention. He said in
part: "The months of May and October
are dedicated by the church to the honor
of the blessed virgin, and on this, the
first of October, we should renew our de
votion to her. She has the power to nelp
us from the very fact that she is a saint
In heaven, and from that fact that she
is also the mother of God. She is willing
to help us. from her own trouble? while
here on this earth."
The evening services were inaugurated
by a procession of :{OO boys and girls
through the church, the choir chanting
responses as Father McDonald gave out
the rosary. Father Lagan of Sacred
Heart parish delivered the sermon in ihe
evening.
Next Sunday the Church of St. Francis
will celebrate its golden anniversary
Founded fifty yÂ§ars ago. it was the first
Catholic church to inaugurate the parish
system in California. Special prav'cr
meetings in preparation for the event
will be held during the week, beginning
Wednesday, and solemn mass will be
celebrated on Sunday

merely a reaction after a long period of commercial

ever. The demand for all sorts of merchandise con

the increase in population, according to treasury esti
mates, is only 16 per cent.

months have been 3,500,676 cases, against 2,833,682 in
1892, and in four weeks 390,622 cases, against 360,699

month or more behind their orders for the season.
This heavy buying characterizes the whole range of
farm and manufactured products, and has been so
often mentioned that repetition is useless. What will
happen when this enormous buying ceases is a ques
tion which has been bothering financiers for some
weeks, but it is folly to cross the bridge before we
get to it. Moderate conservatism and a proper atten
tion to the future will probably be sufficient safeguard
against any serious results from the current boom in
trade.
A safe-cracker was discovered the other night at
work in the Sperry Flour Mill at Fresno. He claimed
that he was only an amateur, but his selection of a
place of operation gave him the lie. The condition
of his clothing showed that he was out for the dust.
The Fresno burglar who robbed a safe to secure
money with which to send his wife and child East will
probably compromise by taking a little journey him
self.
YEARNING FOR DEWEY.
rROM the day when the great popular outburst
of admiration and honor tor Admiral Dewey
manifested itself upon the announcement of his
epoch making victory at Manila, those Democrats
who have long been eager to rid the party of the
leadership of Bryan have been looking to him with
yearning that he might become their candidate for
the Presidency. lie seemed tfc them to be a heaven
sent Mo?es to lead Democracy from the wilderness, if
they could but get him to act in that role, and every
thing which has happened from that time to this has
but increased the yearning and strengthened its hold
upon them.
They were not coy wooers, these Democrats. They
soon let the admiral know that if he would accept the
nomination of the Democratic party he could have it,
and they tried with eloquence to persuade him that
if he would accept the nomination the people would
do the rest and his election to the Presidency would
be as certain as was that of .Grant in 1808.
Dewey promptly rejected the overtures. As a mem
ber of the navy he has had nothing to do with political
parties, but he came from a family of stanch Vermont
Republicans and his partisan leaning?, if he had any,
would be naturally to that side. He announced clearly
when first approached that he has no political ambi
. that he does not feel fitted for undertaking the
grave duties of statecraft in which he has had no ex
perience. In fact, as he laughingly said when some
one suggested to him that "Dewey and Wheeler"
would be a winning ticket, "I would run the nation
like a ship and Wheeler would run it like a regiment."
Despite the positive assurances of the admiral, how
ever, the yearnings of the anti-Bryan Democracy have
not lessened. It is in fact a ground hog case with
them. They must have a candidate to put up against
Bryan and they cannot find one except Dewey. It
, is not surprising, therefore, to find that the celebra
tion of the admiral's arrival at New York has been
at once followed by efforts to bring him forward even
against his will as a candidate.
It is not the irresponsible yellow journals of Democ
racy that are working up the vain Dewey Presidential
boom, nor the lesser class of politicians, but men of
the foremost rank in Democracy. For example, no
less a leader than William C. Whitney is quoted as
having said in regard to it:
"1 am convinced that his selection as Presidential
nominee would be something very much larger and
[ better at this particular time than a party victory.
It would be a partiotic reunion around the one man
who typifies the new era and is best fitted by his char
acter and experience to preside over its development.
Dewey gave us the Philippines. He understands the
situation as no other man does. The people would
trust him to deal with it more completely than they
> would any other man. They would rather see him at
the helm, directing the policy of the Government in
its new possessions, than any other man. They know
that he always has done the right thing and they
would feel sure that he always would do the right
thing. It is only at I ing intervals and on special occa
sions that Providence presents a man in whom the
whole people have this unquestioning and perfect
trust. That gave us such a man in Washington. It
gave us another in Jackson. It gave us another in
Grant. Now it has given us Dewey."
All of which shows on the part of the saner Demo
cratic leaders a very wholesome desire to rid their
party and tlie country of Bryanism. but it also shows
how forlorn is their hope. Admiral Dewey as a Dem
ocratic candidate for the Presidency is an impossi
bility.
While the Venezuelan boundary dispute is still in
the hands of arbitrators the people of the country
have started a revolution, gone through with it and
returned to their cock fights; all of which shows how
much easier it is to fight a thing out than to talk it
out.
The recepton given to Dewey has probably in
clined Sampson to wish a good many times that he
had steamed at once int<> Santiago Hay and smashed
the Spanish as Dewey did at Manila, but in cases of
that kind after thoughts don't count.
THE CARTER CASE.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY has approved the
sentence imposed upon Captain Carter by the
court-martial. The condemned officer is to be
ed from the army, to suffer a fine of $5000,
to be imprisoned for live years and a statement of his
crime, his punishment, his name and place of abode
are to be published in the newspapers in and about
the station and the State from which he came or
wher he usually resided Tims after two years of
delay the punishment imposed by the court is to be
mete! out, and the man who by reason of his power
ful friends seemed at one lime likely to escape with
comparative impunity is to suffer at last.
It is not at all probable, however, that the case will
end here. There is no longer an avenue of appeal to
law, but there remains always the right of an appeal
to public opinion and that is what in all likelihood
will be undertaken next. Wayne MacVeagh. in his
brief submitted to the Attorney General, intimated
'that Carter had not a fair trial before a court compe
tent to deal with the case, and plainly charged that
the War Department had issued to the press false
statements concerning it; and now Frank P. Blair,
who was associate counsel for Carter, openly de
nounces the condemnation pronounced by the court,
and lays what appears to be the foundation for an
agitation of the issue.
He is quoted as saying: "Captain Carter was con
victed on perjured testimony, as the defense clearly
proved. Dreyfus was condemned on hearsay.
Wherein lies the difference? The principal witness for
the prosecution was easily caught in the cross-exam
ination, and yet he was allowed to go on. and on his
testimony alone Captain Carter was condemned, This
injustice to an innocent man shows that the court
martial is utterly unfit to grapple with the questions
involved in a case of this kind. In my estimation a
majority of the court-martial were honest in their be
lief of Carter's guilt. They were inductd to find the
captain guilty, in the main, because of the perjured
testimony of the Government's witnesses."
It is of course to be regretted there should be any
question of the justice of a decision by a military
tribunal in this country. We have regarded our army
with a patriotic pride and have looked upon its offi
cers aÂ« men having the integrity and the ability to per
form all the duties imposed upon them with honor to
themselves and to the nation. Nevertheless, we are
, not superstitious in our reverence for trie army, and
if the friends of Carter make an appeal to public sen
â  timent they will receive a fair hearing.
It is to be noted the members of the court-martial
I are not charged with prejudice against the accused or
corrupt motive^ in condemning him. but only with
j an unfitness for judicial functions and an inability to
; determine what rightly constitutes evidence. That
j simplifies the issue a great deal and will render the
I public more willing to listen to it.
An agitation directed against a department of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1599.
Government is always disagreeable, but the results
are generally beneficial. We had an illustration of the
effect of such appeals in the embalmed beef scandal.
The examinations resulted in a report acquitting a!!
the accused officials, but nevertheless there has been
no more rotten beef sent to the army. Something
equally beneficial may result in this case. A thorough
exposition of the manner in which Carter was con
victed may not reflect discredit upon any member
of the court-martial, but may have the effect of^pro
viding more competent courts for trying such charges
against officers hereafter.
THE MINORITY LEADER.
WITH that well ordered harmony and ability to
act together with promptness which fits them
for conducting the affairs of the nation, the
Republicans of the House of Representatives have al
ready virtually chosen their leader who is to be
Speaker of the coming Congress. The Democrats, on
the other hand, although they constitute a minority
party and their leader will have no patronage to be
stow, are still disputing among themselves as to who
shall have the almost empty honor of presiding at
their caucuses and leading them on the floor.
Bailey of Texas, from whose bright youth so much
was expected, has proven even more futile as a parlia
mentary leader than young Bryan as a Presidential
candidate. His leadership during the last Congress
was a fiasco, and he has either too much sense or too
little courage to desire to repeat the experiment.
Of his own will he is out of the contest, and is now
seeking to obtain the seclusion and the repose of the
Senate as a relief from the stormy struggles of the
House, where he came to grief every time he under
took to distinguish himself.
Three Democrats are eager to take the place left
vacant by Bailey's retirement and are reported to be
busily canvassing for support. These are John H.
Bankhead of Alabama. David A. De Armond of Mis
souri and James D. Richardson of Tennessee. Neither
of the three is brilliant nor has any genuine leader
ship in him. Each, however, has had long experience
in the House, is a man of good repute, and would
probably be an improvement on the aspiring youth
from Texas who won the prize from them in the last
Congress.
Bankhead is said to represent the conservative
Democracy of the South. He has declared more than
once that the Chicago platform is a blunder and that
its doctrines are not those of genuine Democracy. De
Armond is much better known to the nation than
Bankhead, and is reputed to be one of the foremost
constitutional lawyers on the Democratic side. He is
a rank partisan, believes in the spoils system, and
takes the Chicago platform without a murmur.
Richardson is an abler parliamentary tactician than
either of his competitors, but is a feeble debater and
not likely to hold his own well in a contest with the
strong men the Republicans will pit against him. On
the other hand, he is said to know the House better
and to be better known by it than either of his com
\ petitors.
It will be noted that all of the aspirants for the
place are Southerners. That of course is natural, for
the strength of the party comes from that section.
The Northern Democracy has hardly a representa
: tive in the House any better qualified to lead
than those who are now striving for the honor.
Under any circumstances the coming Congress
| promises to be a dull one for Democracy, and for
such fighting as it will be capable of doing almost
ary sort of a leader will be sufficient.
A PROGRAMME FOR PROGRESS.
WITH the current number of the Merchants'
Association Review, a comprehensive pro
gramme for future work on the part of the
association in the direction of municipal improvement
is presented for the consideration of the public.
While nothing new in the way of enterprise is con
tained in the programme, every feature of it having
been at one time or another urged, not only by the
association but by the press, the review is none the
less interesting because it for the first time presents
the whole of the plans for progress now entertained
by progressive citizens.
The programme includes the enforcement of the
civil service provisions of the new charter; the recon
struction and improvement of the sewer system; the
erection of a suitable City and County Hospital, a
hospital for contagious diseases, public school build
in^.-, where necessary, and Fire Department buildings
in districts now without fire protection; the enforce
ment of the law for placing all electric wires under
ground; the improvement of the street cleaning
system; the extension and betterment of the
street lighting and the sprinkling of streets; the
improvement of street pavements; the establishment
of a salt water pumping plant and the use of salt
water for sprinkling streets, flushing sewers and
such purposes; the erection of public comfort stations
throughout the business districts of the city; the ex
penditure of all surplus revenues from taxes in per
manent improvements; and finally an election upon
the question of issuing bonds for such improvements
as are necessary or desirable at the present time, but
which cannot be provided for by the annual tax levy
under the charter dollar limit.
Such a programme is one in which all progressive
citizens will cordially assist the association in fulfilling
as speedily as possible. There is no feature of it that
is either visionary, extravagant or impracticable. Nor
can it be questioned that the association has acted
wisely in presenting all the various schemes for im
provement as parts of one comprehensive programme.
It gives assurance that one reform is not to be over
looked in the interests of another and affords a basis
on which the progressive elements of the community
can co-operate with general satisfaction.
Another religious conference has demanded that
Roberts of Utah be denied a seat in Congress because
he is a Mormon, but as it demanded at the same time
the abolition of the canteen in the Soldiers' Home,
the condemnation of the Sunday newspaper and base
ball games, and denounced Sunday travel, Mr. Rob
erts will find himself in so much good company he
will hardly feel the full severity of the attack on him.
The Navy Department has decided evidently that
the men who fought "with Dewey on the Olympia
shall not be Hobsonized. It has ordered the flagship
to Boston, where, if tradition is to be believed, the
girls will give the Jackies the frozen face.
Chief of Police Lees ought to join the Society for
the Suppression of Vice. He might learn something
to his advantage in treating with the solution of moral
evil which afflicts the northern part of the city.
Certain important changes have been ordered in the
French army. The French people have reason for
congratulation in the fact that whatever the changes
may be they can't be for the worse.
If the rebels of Venezuela suffered as many en
counters as the various correspondents credit them
with the country would be practically depopulated by
this time

RAIDS ARE TO
BE PREVENTED

JUDGE HUNT'S DECISION MAY
GO FOR NOTHING.
, â¦
The Board Will Be Restricted by the
Auditor to Its Own Fund and
Wholesale Appointments
Will Be Stopped.
The raid on the treasury which the
Board of Health is contemplating- as a
means of paying another bunch of Dan
Burns' Senatorial debts will likely be
nipped in the bud. Although Judge Hunt's
recent decisions apparently opened the city
and county cash drawer to either hand '
the Health Board clique cared to dip into ;
It, there is still a vigilant watchdog in i
the person of Auditor Asa R. Wells. If ;
any of the claims the gang is gleefully
projecting get past him they ought to be
paid. There is small chance, however,
that any of them will.
Judge Hunt's decision may have been
precisely along the lines of the opinion j
of the individual members of the board, â¢
and coinciding with that opinion it may
have given the board the power to make
all the appointments it finds necessary, or i
that Burns' political obligations render
necessary, but Judge Hunt's decision did
not add a cent to the tax levy nor put an- !
other cent in the treasury; neither did it i
add a sou marquis to the apportionment
lixed for the board. If Auditor Wells pur
sues the same course that has charac- j
terlzed his administration thus far, he !
will not deplete the general fund, or any
other fund, for Burns, no matter what
that astute politician's necessities.
That the Health Board would make the
most of the Hunt decision became evident
at the meeting of Saturday night when
Dr. Keeney worked through his little plan
for the appointment of three more plumb
ing inspectors to assist Chief Inspector
Beyreuther. and at the same time car
ried into effect Dr. Coffey's scheme for
a wholesale cleaning out of the County
Almshouse in order to make room for the
elect of the combination. Coffey's Alms
house programme would have gone
through at the last meeting had he con
sented in time to vote for Dr. Hodghead
to succeed Dr. Susdorf as Superintendent
of the City and County Hospital. He j
held out, however, for Dr. Mahr, and not
until Drs. Keeney and Payne had al
most given up hope of putting Hodghead
through at thai meeting did a threat to
kill the Almshouse clean out bring Coffey
to time.
Since that time heart to heart talks with
Burns and his lieutenants have been the
thing, with the result that the Board of
Health is about the happiest and most
harmonious political combination at the
City Hall and only the next meeting is
needed to demonstrate what the weekly
percentage uf new appointments is to be.
Concerning the course he would take
with claims filed by the board in excess
of its actual appropriation. Auditor W r ells
declined yesterday to speak. "I think the
board Is spending too much money," said
he, "but what course I will take With
its warrants in the face of Judge Hunt's
decision I am not yet prepared to nay.
It has been my policy to protect the
treasury against any other than necessary
claims, and with our appropriations fixed
on the basis they are I shall adhere more I
closely to that policy than ever. I will j
be compelled to. if I want to last the year
out Without bankrupting every department.
I am going to talk the matter over with
my attorney and I think that no one will
have reason to fear that I will depart
from consistency or announce any change
in my present policy."

JAMES W. GIRVIN AND HIS DOUBLE.
Curious Ways in Which They Have Been
Mistaken for Each Other Through Life/
Honolulu Pacific Commercial-Advertiser.
DID I ever look like that? Well,
hardly," said James W. Girvin
on Saturday, when he was asked
about the picture in The Call of
September 2 that had his name
under it. __
"And yet that is a picture of James W.
Girvin all right, for I happen to know him
wellâ to my sorrow. 1 might almost say.
Do you know that that man has been the
bane of my life almost from the day he
was born and was unfortunate enough
to be named James W. Girvin, the same
as myself? I have run across that man
everywhere, in all sorts of odd ways and
places. He has opened my mail, castled
my checks, been mistaken for me by hun
dreds of people from San Diego to ban
Francisco and back again; in fact, at one
time he actually made my life miserable.
He was always where I was expected,
and generally got there first and his
name, being the same as mine, people
talked to him as the real James W. Gir
vin and looked on me as an impostor.
And it was a singular fact that many of
the bills he contracted were presented to
me for payment.
"You would hardly believe it possible
for two men to cross each other's paths
as we have done. About the first time I
ran across him was in this way: I owned
a lot in Piedmont Cemetery, Oakland,
which had the name James v Girvin
painted on a post at the foot. On one
of my visits to the cemetery I could not
find the lot; at least, not the lot with
my name on it. The lots were all about
the same size and looked very much alike
and as I had been away for some years
since the post was put up, I thought I
might have mistaken the location. I went
to the same lot several times feeling sure
it was the right one. but somebody else's
name was on the post. I went to the
superintendent of the cemetery and asked

there.

you to it.' He took me to the identical
lot I thought was mineâ the one with the
other name on it. I showed him the new
name and then he told me to go to the
office and we would look up the records.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Contracts for twelve torpedo-boat
destroyers have been given out by the
British admiralty to half a dozen private
shipyards in England and Scotland.
A report comes from Shoeburyness of
some marvelous good target shooting. It
is alleged that a 6-inch quick-firing gun,
which fired 1000 shots against a target
moving at the rate of thirty-seven miles
an hour, made 970 hits. Further particu
lars are needed, such as distance of gun
from target and other conditions, in order
to have others besides Tommy Atkins be
lieve it as an example of accurate firing.
The British battleship Canog^us, -whose
trials were canceled by the admiralty
owing to defects in the machinery, has
had her leaky points repaired and passed
through one-fifth and two-fifth power
trials in the first days of September. The
ship was on an even keel of 26 feet
draught and developed 10,454 horsepower
with 255 pounds of steam, consuming coal
at the low rate of 1.68 pounds per horse
power per hour, and the speed was 17.2
knots.
It is reported that the British admiralty
is about to adopt pneumatic riveters and
i other tools driven by compressed air for
use in the dockyards. As American tools
i of this description are the best, the manu
, facturers in this country are likely to
1 receive large orders, not alone from
foreign Government yards but also from
private ship-building establishments. The
introduction of these tools is also apt to
make trouble with the trades unions, es
pecially in England.
France will place in commission during
the present year one battleship, one third
class cruiser, four torpedo-boat de
stroyers and twenty-five torpedo-boats.
Great Britain will have placed in com
mission for the same period five battle
j ships, four first-class, four second-class
i and six third-class cruisers, besides about
| twnty torpedo-boat detroyers. Not
! withstanding the apparent great activity
i in' Franch dockyards, only a few ships
I are annually put in commission.
A training-ship for the Chilean navy
! named General Bacquedamo lias Just
i been completed at the Armstrong yard,
Klswick. The vessel is built of steel,
sheathed with wood and is 2300 tons dis
placement, with a length of 277 feet, tS
feet 9 inches beam and 18 feet draught.
: She is bark rigged with ; uxiliary steam
!of 1500 horsepower, and carries 350 ton of
j coal. Her speed under steam is 13% knots,
, and the battery consists of four 4.7-inch,
two 12-pounders, two 6-pounders and one
; 18-inch bow torpedo.
An armor plate trial took place at
Whale Island last month in the Nettle
casement. The plate was one of a lot to
go on the Japanese battleship Shiki
shima, building at the Thames Iron
AVorks, and was of nickle steel 8% inches
thick and eight feet square. Two shots
were fired at the plate from a 9.2-inch
gun carrying a Holtzer shell of 308 pounds
With a velocity of 1700 feet per second.
Neither shot penetrated nor did the plate
show any cracks. A third shot fired with
a velocity of 1800 feet penetrated the plate
to a depth of 3 a i inches, but there were
no cracks and the plnte lot was accepted.
Italy contemplates building four 8000-ton
armored cruisers of the Brice type, but
carrying smaller guns, namely, eight B
inch and eight C-inch. Although the
money has not been voted the ships have
already been named the Genoa, Piza,
Venezia and Amaifi. They are to have

over the mistakes."
"When <li'l you run across him last, Mr
Girvin?" was asked.
"Oh, the last time I was in Calif
I met him one day on Broadway in
land He was on his uppers and strui
me for a loan of $50. I had not the m>>i
in my pocket, but gave him a check I
the money on one of the Oakland banks
the. cashier of which was one of my per
sonal friends. I made the check pa
to James W. Girvin and signed it
James W. Girvin without thinking of
any further trouble. About an hour
I happened to pass by that part:
bank when my attention was attracted by
a lou<l altercation going on inside. 1
looked in and there was the other J
W. Girvin and my friend, the cashier, al
most coming to blows. It appears thai
the other Girvin had indorsed my check
and presented it for payment. The cashier
knew it was not my signature on the back
of the check and. thinking I had drawn it
payable to myself instead of the other
Girvin, had not only refused to pay it
but had accused the other Girvin of
wrongfully signing my name to obtain
the money. As soon as I went in both
parties appealed to me.
"I said to the cashier, ' The man is right:
he is James W. Girvin and I will vouch
for him.' The cashier said in all his ex
perience he had nevr run across such a
singular instance resulting from a simi
larity of names.
"I had thought I had lost track of the
other Girvin for good when I returned to
the islands About five ;. ears ago," con
cluded Mr. Girvin, "and yot the very first
time I write a few lines for publication
in a San Francisco paper that fellow's
picture comes out at the heal of it. Now,

he is in the islands and will be writing

Another freak armored ship has been
launched at Cherbourg. It is the Henry
IV of 8948 tons, 334 feet 3 inches in length,
72 feet 10 inches beam and 23 feet draught.
This is a compromise between an Ameri
can monitor and the battleship Hoche
types; that is, the after part is. monitor
and the forward portion resembles a
floating hen coop on end. There can be
but little doubt of the failure of ti is
freak as to seagoing qualities, and ar
mored ship-building is not likely to be
revolutionized by the introduction of this
craft. Her battery consists of two 10.&
-inch guns, one forward and one aft in
turrets, and seven 7^2-inch in broadside.
She is to have triple screws, Niclausse
boilers and engines of 11,500 horse;
to give a speed of seventeen knots,
total estimated cost of this craft is about
$4,005,000.

MULTITUDES PASS A GLORIOUS SUNDAY
INCIDENTS OBSERVED AT THE PARK YESTERDAY.
ALL of the glories of a pleasant
season crowded themselves into
the brief hours of yesterday, and
joy was In the hearts of the peo
ple. Early in the morning the doors
of the city's homes, from those of the
palatial mansions of the rich to the
humble dwellings of the poor, swung
open, and their occupants, eager to
commune with nature and anxious for
a day of recreation out In the open,
poured in a human tide through the
gates of the park and out over the car
lines to the beach.
Thousands sat throughout the after
noon and applauded the selections of
the park band. Thousands more basked
on the sand, splashed in the breakers
at the beach or plunged into the tanks
at Sutro's Baths. Out at Stow Lake
fond fathers tugged at the oars of
boats loaded with family and friends
and light-headed youths skipped peÃ
bles along the surface of the rippling
waters for the amusement of giggling
sweethearts and the delight of onlook
ers. Fat and lean men, thin and stout
women and whlte-c wants
trundled baby buggies through the
shaded avenues or carried the cooing
youngsters in arms to chosen retreats.

DEDICATED THE ORGAN
IN THE FRENCH CHURCH
THE CEREMONIES SOLEMN AND
IMPRESSIVE.
Mass Celebrated by Rev. Father
Roman, S. M. â Sacred Concert
in the Evening Concluded
the Dedication.
j The grand organ recently constructed In
i the French Church of Notre Dame dcs
I Victoires, on Bush street, was dedicated
| yesterday morning with impressive cere
monies. Solemn high mass was celebrated
by Rev. Father Roman, S. M., assisted by !
Rev. Father Nuailles, S. S. C. C. and
I Father Feriol, S. S. C. C, as deacon and
; sub-deacon. The predicant was ' Rev.
Father Hamet, S. M., who Is in charge of
the parish. An interesting feature of the
â  services was the presence of fifty little
boys dressed In blue, white and red cos- j
[ tumes, who were stationed arouna the
altar rail.
Previous to the commencement of the i
mass the procession of clergy and acolytes
moved toward the organ in tne gallery and ;
the Instrument was blessed and conse
crated to the 'service of God by the cele
j brant. Returning to the sanc'.uary Clm
i orasa's beautiful mass was intoned by a
select and augmented choir under the j
leadership of frofessor 8. Martinez, the
organist. The sopranos were Mrs. G.
Uarrissen and Miss L. Bernard, altos Mrs.
E. l'lantard and Miss R. Hickey, tenors
R. Hantuis and Charles Thrower, bassos
8. Fogarty and G. Bournizeau. A violin
solo was played by Professor M. Loraza. ;
in hiM sermon Father Hamet took for
his subject the "Love of God and Coun- ;
try." He referred to the fealty which j
, every man owed to the land that gave
! him birth, and exhorted his hearers to j
! crown that commendable spirit by an un
swerving love for divine Providence, to*
whom mankind owes everything, even his
very existence. His auditors were visibly
affected when the eloquent clergyman
said that though Frenchmen who come
to America may adopt this country us
their own and would always be loyal to *
her, .still their beloved France was very
dear to them and they could never entirely ,
forget her. â¢
The church was again crowded in the !
evening, when a sacred concert was given j
by the same artists who assisted at the â 
morning cervices. Pergolesi's "Stabat !
Mater" was sung In line style, and Miss
Florence Lipsher executed a brilliant vio
lin solo entitled "The Last Sleep of the
Virgin," by Massenet.
The new organ is a tubular pneumatic !
Instrument and was built by a Chicago
firm expressly for the church at a cost of
(3600, which amount Is now In process of
collection.

HIGHER PATRIOTISM.
Rev. William Bader Speaks of Ad-
miral Ite-wey and What HÂ«
Exemplifies.
j "The Return of AdmirHl Dowoy and the
' Higher Heroism of the Nation' was the
; topic of an Interesting sermon by the
Rev. William Raxl^r at the Third Congre
: gational Church last night. The pastor
Spoke strongly on the higher patriotism
which should animate the American peo
ple In th^ present situation. He in
: brief:
"Dewey is the last name in the list of â 
i American heroes. It is a great thing- this j
ornwnlng of a groat man. The day of the
individual has not gone. He is still the â¢
llK'ntninK which kindles into flame, the
dry stloks of the nation's patriotism. The
nation must eilr.B to the higher patriot-
Ism. This is the only salvation from tne
! perils of expansion. If the loaves and
fishes are the object of the Philippine
| war. then our possessions will not do ua j
'. honor.
"As to individual heroism, it is well that
! this iron element of the heroic be en
countered in an age when sentlmentalism
j rules so many pens and softens so many
I characters."

A communication has been received by
the citizens' executive committee on the
reception of returning California volun
teers from the Association of Friends and
Relatives apking assistance In the recep
tion of the men from California who will
return on the transports Tartar and New
port or any other ship. The communica

The association asks that the citizens'
commit fe allow the association one thou
sand or twelve hundred dollars to defray
the expenses of a suitable welcome for the !
California volunteers, promising at the I
same time that all expenditures will bo' j
kept of reonrd, and supKestingr that if such
an arrangement be not satisfactory that \
one of the members of the citizens' com
ntlttee I>>Â° mnd> a member of tho associa
tion and keep trark of all expenses.
There will be a meeting of the associa- !
tlon this evening and an answ.-r to the !
appeal is expected.

MINERS ARRIVE
FROM KOTZEBUE
AND CAPE NOME
They Say the Cape Is
Very Rich.
COARSE GOLD IS ABUNDANT
â¦
SIX THOUSAND MEN AT LEAST
ARE THERE.
â¦
Still Another District Has Been Dis
covered and the People Are
Excited and Very
Restless'
The schooner Charles Hanson arrived
yesterday from Kotzebue Sound with a
budget of Interesting news about the Cape
Xonif 1 gold fields. It brought twenty-two
passengers, all miners, many of whom
bave all around Alaskan mining expe
riences. There were also on board four
teen persons connected with tbe Kotzebue
Commercial and Mining Company. There
were some pretty tall stories told by the
passengers about the great abundance of
gold at Cape Nome. They talked about
$60 and even $300 nuggets as being common
things to encounter in a day's labor. None
of the passengers claimed to have brought
down large fortunes, or any very consid
erable sums of their own, although there
were several bottles and small .sacks of
coarse gold on the vessel, running In
value up to a few thousand dollars for
the heaviest Individual showing.
The discrepancy between the small
amounts held individually by the passen
gers and the stories of gold to be found
so easily and plentifully at Cape Nome
was explained on the basis of the short
stay of the passengers at the Cape. Some
were sick when they sailed for home;
others were tired of cold weather and
wished to come home to recuperate; oth
ers were out of provisions to carry them
through the winter, close at hand, and
took the first chance to get away; but
they all said there is plenty of gold at the
Cape, and they also predict that the next
vessel to arrive from that section will
bring down a large amount of treasure.
Among the passengers were the follow
ing: Jim Williams, Tom Grimes, Gus
Llndquist, George Forderer, Ed Andrews,
Frank HlKginbottom, Frank Spitzer, Will
iam Ames, A. Normandin, John Truman,
G. Salisbury, Gus Roeder, E. G. Miller.
William Walker, Dr. Gleaves and Messrs.
Moore, McCuskey, Dozier, Patterson and
Prendergast, all old miners.
Sam Price of this city, who was a short
time only at Cape Nome, told of his ex
periences, He wintered last year on the
Kowak River, and from there went to
Cape Nome on the Louisa D. He arrived
about the midule of July. The claims
were then about all taken up. There were
four good districts, lying along Glacier,
Dexter and Anvil creeks and Snow Gulch.
He worked on No. 10 Anvil, which be
longed to the Laps. He received $9 per
day and board for his work. The weather
was very bad, he said, and he could not 1
stand the climate. He helped every day
to clean up the Biuices, which were very !
rich. There was no doubt that the own
ers of the claim were making very large
amounts of money. The wages were good,
but It was almost Impossible to keep men
because every one was excited and no one
except the claim owners would stay long
in one place.
The beach was âv rich, and men were
washing out from $15 to $20 a day. People
were nocking to Cape Nome from all the
districtsâ from Dawson largely, also from
Porcupine and Rampart. There were at
least 6000 men at Cape Nome when the
Hanson sailed. Already a great deal of
business whs doing. There were three
companies with large stores, and all three
were making money.
Ed Miller or the Kotzebue Company
confirmed the story told by Price. He
said the mining holes on the beach at
Cape Nome were as thick as grasshop
pers in a hayfleld. and the soil fairly
reeked with coarse gold. The owner
ship of claims was still undecided. After
the miners had been ordered from the
beach by the soldiers tney were allowed to
return, by order of the District Attorney,
as already previously published.
Dr. Gleaves, who has a brother in this
city, Bill Ames, Schaeffer and Billy Treat
came over the trail from Koizebue to ]
Cape Nome in April across the ice mil '
snow, and they were forced to .'at their
dogs on the way. The distance was 600
miles. They met others on. the trail and
were obliged to divide the dog meat to
keep the others alive. Dr. de France died
on 'he trail from Kotzebue to Cape Nome,
frozen to death, and was burled on the
ice. Two other*, names unknown, were
killed by natives. The disease known. as]
"blackleg" was killing many. Those Tho
stayed out of doors and those who kÂ«pt
in the house were equally arfected.
Just before the Hanson sailed another
strike was reported, and a party of fifty,
banding together to protect themselves
against the Indians, bought a steamer
and started to go to the head of Reed

Miller thinks that the Hayne party will

LAST OF THE CIRCUS.
It Left Last Night for Redwood City
and San Jose.
M.ain's circus has gone, but it has left
a memory with those who saw it that will
insure a welcome for the show whenever
it chooses to return.
The final performance was given iast
evening to as full a tent as has attended
the week under canvas. There was the
usual programme, but for those who
wished to linger there was the breaking
up of It all. The going away was a show
in itself, and there were many who took
advantage of the opportunity and saw the
exhibition fold its tents and silently steal
away. There was no hurry, no rush, no
confusion. Every one knew just what to
do, and every one had a duty to perform,
and while an outsider was wondering
how the whole thing was going to get
away, the big tent collapsed and was
folded in sections, and then was off to
the cars waiting a block n-wny. The seats
had gone before the show was well over,
and the menagerie had disappeared be
fore the show v.&s out. The cook tent
went at dark; the acrobats and clowns
departed as soon as their acts were done,
and by 1 o'clock what had been all life
and action ami canvas and men and
horses, was only the old familiar Six
teenth and Folsom street ball grounds,
with here and there a hole in the earth
where a tent peg had helped to hold up
the show. It was like the going of an
army.
While it was here the circus made it
self popular, but it was no more popular
with the people as a show than its man
agers were with those they met in busi
ness. They were wonders in their way
as well, as was the sideshow. The man
in the ticket wagon. Warren A. Patrick,
was a worldbeater in his line. He holds
the record for selling tickets and for the
refusal ot" bad money. He can sell more
tickets than any man living, by acKial
count and in a shorter time, and in ail his
career with Main's he has accepted only
$1.55 in unpassable coin. He will not take
bad money. He has a natural aversion
to it that has the added advantage of long
cultivation. William Sells, who has
owned circuses of his own, is also on the
staff as manager of Main's, and to his ef
forts is due much of the popularity the
show earned for Itself. And there is also
the press agent, J. D. Harrison, whose
card is a guarantee of freedom with every
gatekeeper In the show and an assurance
of courtesy to every one whose business
leada him under the canvas.
Th<> show will be In Redwood City to
day and to-night and then it will go to
San Jose.

YACHTS ARE
READY FOR
THEIR RACES
Columbia and Shamrock Will
Meet To-Morrow in the
?irst of the Cup Races.
NEW YORK. Cct. I.â The Columbia
and Shamrock will tu^et in their lirst race
for the America cup at about 11 o'clock
Tu< sday morning. It is expected that it
will prove a < on test as earnest and in
teresting as any that have preceded it
for the international yachting trophy,
wherein skill and judgment will p!;ty as
iÃipontanf a part as the. speed of the
respective boats.
The first rave will he over a course of
thirty miles, starting: from Sandy Hook
lightship to windward or leeward, ac
cording to the direction of the breeze.
The second rate will be triangular, ten
miles to a leg, and will be Balled <>n
Thursday it' no serious accident happens
to the yachts on Tuesday. And so the
contest will alternate in matter of courses
every other day until one of t li Â»- yachts
has won t in ee races.
The New York Yacht Club officials have
been striviiiu for months to complete
their arrangements with a view to a
satisfactory and pleasant termination of
the match. Everything possible under the
circumstances has been done to this end,
and if the public lend them a hand suc
cess must attend their efforts.
According to the agreement under which j
the raits arc to he sailed the winner of!
three out of the Beries of live is to keep!
or take the â¢â¢up. as the case may be. The
dates fixed are October ?,. October 5 and <
October 7. and if it is necessary to sail!
five races the following Tuesday and
Thursday are the extra days named for
ihe contest. The conditions which gov
ern the races are that the first race shall
be to windward or to leeward and return:
second race, an equilatorical triangle;
third race, similar to the lirst : fourth,
similar to the second: fifth race, similar;
to the first. The .-.nirses shall be as near- j
ly as possible thirty nautical miles.
Because "t the lay of the landâ the
position of the coasts of Ixing Island and
New Jerseyâ the starting point for each
race is likely to bo the Sandy Hook
lightshipâ the red hulk that is anchored
about seven miles to the eastward of the
point of t he hook. But at times the wind
comes so that the Scotland lightship, a
yellow hulk four and an eighth miles
nearer Sandy Hook, is more convenient,
and ii might easily happen that it would
be used, especially in the triangular
course.
The starting line is to be formed by the
fiagphip of the New Fork Yacht Club,
anchoring near one of the lightships men
tioned. The usual distance is two hun
dred yards, but there is no specified dis
tance in the agreement. A preparatory
gun on the flagship will be fired fifteen
minuti s before the crossing time. Ten
: minutes later a warning gun will be Bred
and iii five minutes the third gun. which
, is the starting signal. The racers have
two minutes left in which they may cross.
i and a fourth gun will announce the etui
j of that limit. Each will be timed on the
I second It crosses. Bach race is to be
started a 1 li o'clock If possible, but a dead
calm or a fog or a heavy galeâ a real
storm- would necessarily postpone the
race, and it is agreed that no race shall
be started after 1 2 : :><j o'clock.
Further than that, to avoid a drifting
I match, wherein a boat may win rather by
I luck than by the qualities of yachts or
I ir. ws, it is agreed that if one of the
| yachts Is not at the home line within five
hours and thirty minutes after the start
the race shall be declared off and the
same* course Will then be laid out on the
next race day.
.Another very important agreement re.
lates to accident. If a yacht la seriously
crippled by accident before the race la
started time for repairs will be allowed
but it anything carries away after the
signal the sufferer must do its best with
its repairs as it sails the course and take
the consequences. For this Is to be a test
of construction as well as of design and '
seamanship.
True to Nacure.

SAN FRANCISCO
CAPTURES THE
THREE GAMES
Easy Victories for the Loca
Team on the Oakland and
Recreation Diamonds.
San Francisco 6, Santa Cruz 2.
! Three straight gamps taken from a
1 bunch of Lobsters was the work of the
local balltossers this week. It was sim
'< ply a case of working the batting eye and
bunching hits at opportune moments.
' And now, Harris says, he is himself again.
; There were plenty of hits on the Recre-
a tion Grounds diamond yesterday after
i noon and occasionally a moment of excite
' ment. Whalen. the sand-promenader,
was found at the outset, and the three
runs made by San Francisco In the first
inning were all-sufficient to have won the
game. Brockhoff was urst at bat, and he
rapped out a single, taking the second
i bag on a passed ball and third on Hilde
brand's hit. Krug sent both Brockhoff
and Hildebrand home with a hit which
I provoked some wild juggling and bad
throwing by Streib and Devereaux; so
< Krug crossed the bag before Santa Cruz
â  realized the game was on.
In the fifth Santa Cruz put a mark on
the store board. Babbitt hit one of Fire
man Fitz's ln-curves for two bags, and
! Devereaux, who followed him to the bat,
grew envious and did likewise. One other
; run was affixed to the Santa Cruz score
in the eighth inning. Devereaux received
a present of the first bag. and there he re
! mained while two of his brothers bought
'. tombstones. Fitz wanted to make a clean
i sweep of it. and he threw to first to catch
Devereaux napping. Fitz's aim was bad,
and the ball rolled over by the fence.
I Devereaux kept moving around the bags,
! and Courtney tried to stall him off at
third, but another wild throw resulted,
and Devereaux scored.
In the sixth inning Sullivan, Courtney
| and Pyne scored for the locals.
I Two sensational catches were made dur
: ing the gameâ one by Muller, who pulled
I down a long drive over the left-field foul
I line, and another by Drennan, who came
all the way from deep center to the infield
for a high fly that sent Brockhoff from
the plate to the bench. The score was:

MORNING GAME.
San Francisco 9, Santa Cruz 5.
At Oakland yesterday morning the
crowd was-- treated to a Fourth of July
fireworks display, without the fog-. Both
llmrs and Andrews were hit hard and
often, and all runs were in a groat meas
ure the result of whacking stick work.
In the first inning Broc-khoft was given
a base on balls, and Hlldebrand followed
to thp first bag on an error by Williams,
Brockhoff going to third. A hit by Krug
Bcored Brockhoff, and later on a hit by
Courtney gave Hildebrand and Krug a
chance to add two runs to the list. In
the third inning Krug and Sullivan scored
for the locals.
The fourth inning was the lobsters'
own. Williams made first on an error,
and hits by Devereaux and Drennan
hroupht him over the rubber. A safe hit
by ("lark filled all bags. Streib found the
ball for a bit. and Devereaux scored, but
â¢ 'lark perished at second. Drennan was
the last of the Lobsters to be sent home
this inning. A fumble by Reilly of Dal
rymple's grounder was the moving cause.
The very next inning San Francisco
added three more runs to the score. Hil
debrand opened with a home run, Sullivan
was hit by the pitcher and Courtney and
Reilly Bwatted the ball for a couple of
iwo-iiagKirs, Sullivan and Courtney scor
ing. In the eighth San Francisco attached
the ninth run to its list.
This same inning brought a brace of
runs to Santa Cruz. A single by Drennan.
followed by a thivc-bagger from Clark's
bat was responsible for the first run.
Clark scored "ti Dalrymple's out.

Oakland Team Wins.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. :.â Oakland won
from Sacramento again to-day in one of
the raggedest. slowest games of the sea
son, regardless of the fact that there were
three home runs, two doubles and a "Gar
rison" finish. The game was replete with
errors and stupid plays. The home runa
were due to the high north
wind, which swept fly halls out
of bounds. Doyle relieved Har
vey in the sixth. Harper was wild
much of the time and was hit freely. Um
pire O'Connell shut Oakland out of a run
in the eighth, which would have tied the
score. Regardless of adverse circum
stances, the Duties braced up in the ninth
and by a base on balls, two errors by the
locals and Schmeer's base drive won the
game. Score:

WIN THE BROWN PENNANT.
California Cricketers Defeat the Ala
meda Eleven and Become the
Champions of 1899.
The California Cricket Club, which was!
organized at the beginning of this season.
defeated the Alameda eleven, the cham
pions of last year, yesterday and won the
Brown pennant for 1899. Another match
yet remains on the schedule, but. can |
make no difference in the general result
of the season's play. Alameda's captain
won the toss and took the field. Sloman
and Dickenson got well set, and the tele
graph board showed 73 before they were ,
parted. B. P. Ritchie added 35 and
Schroeder 13 to the total, the inning clos
ing for 154. Ward was the most success
ful of the Alameda bowlers, taking six
wickets for 40 runs.
When Alameda went to the bat wickets
fell rapidly at first, three being down for
13 and four for 29. .Moriarty, however,
made a splendid stand, scoring 60 runs,
his wicket being the last to fall. I, 'roll
made 24 and 11. Ward Jr. 11. "With seven
wickets down for 117 victory seemed fairly
within the grasp of the Californias, but
they were not quite free from anxiety ill!
the inning closed for 138 runs. California
thus won by 18 runs. Cookson took three
wickets for 44 and Howard two for 27. The

Good Shooting was the order of the day
at the Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club's
monthly class medal contests and re-en

occasion was a ten-shot record made by
Ed Hovey with a 22-caliber rifle in the
Daisa all-comers' match at fifty yards.
His shooting tied the highest record on
an open range, heretofore held by E. Ja

SIX EVENTS
AT OAKLAND
IN FUTURE
Good Card This Afternoon.
The Coming: Los Angeles
Mcct â Local Gossip.
The gamp at Oakland brightened up so
noticeably the closing days of last week
that, commencing this afternoon, the
California Jockey Club has decided to run
off six events on each racing day. On Sat
urday the books received a surprisingly
big play. Joe Harlari; not noted as an ex
traordinarily fast man on the block,
handled $7000 to the five races, which
augurs well for the season now in prog
ress. Local turf-goers, as in all other
branches of sport, are anxious to see
the "stranger," and as the Eastern
horses arrive the crowds will increase in
proportion.
Don Cameron was greatly disappointed
in the showing made by his fast sprinter,
Dr. Nembula, on Saturday. He had a
heavy commission down, and hopes to re
coup his 1055,.-, as the son of Portland be
comes better acclimated.
Two boys now riding in OAkland, J.
Walsh and T. Walsh, seem to be the
source of much guessing among a number
of racegoers. T. Walsh is in the employ
of "Butch" Fisher, while Jimmy Walsn
has lately been taken In hand by P. Ryan,
the Middle Western turfmen. " Both are
practically novices, and which is the
"good one" remains to be seen by the im
provement they make In the saddle.
Or. Thursday, October 5, the Occidental
Horse Exchange. Tim Howard street, will
hold a sale of choice trotting-brc-d mares,
and geldings bred at Oakwood stock farm.
This establishment is the home of the
noted sires Steinway and Charles Derby.
Owners and trainers who Intend rating
at the Los Angeles fall meeting shouUl
not forget that entries for the Derby
close October 9. Entries may be left with
J. P. Atkins, who can be found at the
entry clerk's office on the Oakland track
any morning between the hours of 10 and
1.. The conditions of the Derby are so
liberal that almost any fairly good maiden
three-year-old looks to have a rosy chance
to draw down the long end of the prize.
The scale of allowances ranges from three
pounds down to a maiden allowance of
twenty-five pounds.
Jockey Beauchamp. who had his license
revoked by Captain Rees recently at Chi
cago, is talking of cmharl^ng in the cigar
business in this city.
S. F. Capps refused an offer of $1250 for
Bogus Bill after the two-year-old's im
pressive win on Saturday. . Cyclone, the
sire of Bogus Bill, also got the remark
ably good performer. Joshua, one of the
best mudlarks ever raced in this section
of the country.
Hughe Jones, who booked throughout
the season at St. Louis, will probably cut
in this week.
â  Morgan, the Indian rider, will probably
be seen here this winter with the Daly
string from Montana. He is a very cap
able, trustworthy pilot, scoring a great
hit on the New York tracks early in the
season. He met with an accident that
shelved him.
The following stables have already
reached or passed the $500 mark in the
amount of money won: Burns & Water
house, $1605; Cambridge stable. $700: J. 11.
Shields, $623; Caesar Young. $625; J. < 'of
fey. $575; P. Ryan. $575; P. Hildreth, $550;
F. J. O'Rourke, $500.

CENTENARIAN DIES AT
HOME OF ADULT BLIND
OAKLAND, Oct. I.â Henry Parker, a native of Hawaii, who for the past
twelve years has been ar. inmate of the Home for the Adult Blind in this
city, died at that Institution this afternoon. Until last Monday he was
as cheerful as ever, making broomÃ at the home, but since then the re
markable vitality that has kept him alive for more than a hundred years be
gan leaving him suddenly, and he sank rapidly.
Parker came to the Blind Home twelve years ago with another blind man
named Chambers from an institution in the northern part of this State. He
had previously been a miner, and prior to that was a sailor. Chambers, who
passed away at the home several months ago, had known Parker for nearly
fifty years, and before he died declared that during the years of his acquaint
ance the Hawaiian had changed but little from age, and that at the time he
first knew him Parker was more than 50 years of age.
Frequently Parker rolatf-d stories of historical facts concerning his native
home and of the Hawaiian Kings, the familiarity with facts bearing out his
claim as a centenarian.
When quite young Parker wa? shanghaied fro his native land and taken
aboard a vessel, finally drifting to America.
X'ntil quite recently Parker was a tine specimen physically, and he attrib
uted his longevity to the great care of his body and his temperate habits.

Council, largely on sectional lines, it will

! Some time during the week an item was
published in this paper referring to the
fact that a county employe had found it
easy, while In office, to duplicate bills and
dishonestly acquire a large sum of money
before his practice was discovered. I am
; told that an inference was drawn from this
i that Phil Walsh, who now fills the office,
j might follow his predecessor's example.

i who do not read as I do, I do not hesi-
I tate to affirm that no such inference was
intended, and certainly no one who knows
Mr. Walsh would permit himself to sug
i gest that any such inference had the least
j foundation In fact.
In one of these letters a few weeks ago
; there was a list, not very lengthy, of
i the gifts rich men had given to Oakland
in half a century. It included an ob
servatory, a clock and lens for : a tele-
I scope, and possibly a few other things.
I A gentleman writing from St. Louis to
! last night's Tribune accused me of forget
} ting that Dr. Merriit had left a princely
i sum to erect a public hospital in Oakland,
i 1 did not forget it. It is true that Dr.
j Merritt left such a sum, but he has been
! dead many years; his estate has been tied
up in litigation, and Oakland appears to
be as far as ever from getting that hos
pital, and only a short time ago one of
those connected with the estate said that
' even if Oakland does ultimately receive
! this bequest it will not be nearly so large
I as many people have been lead to believe.
When the hospital is dedicated I will re

BURNED THE MORTGAGE.
Golden Gate Baptists Destroy the
Demon of Debt.
OAKLAND. Oct. Lâ What remained in
black and white of the mortgage on the j
property of the Golden Gate Baptist
Church was burned up this afternoon, and ,
the attending ceremony proved very
unique. The linai liquidation of the small
balance on the old original $12<X> mortgage
was the cause for general jubilation
among the Baptists throughout the pic- j
turepque suburb, as well as Oakland i
proper, and the ail-day services at the |
Golden Gate Church commenced with roll
call at 11 a. m.. followed by res]
and an interesting address by Rev. Rob
ert Whitaker, superintendent of missions !
for northern Central California. The re
ception of a number of new members and
th<- .Lord's Supper concluded the furenoon
exercises. j
There was an unusually large attend- ;
to witness the ceremony of burning,
the mortgage, which took place this after- |
nun. practically in the pulpit. An or
dinary china plate was secured. Into this â 
the church treasurer. Mr. Fraser, poured
some alcohol and ignited the liquid. Then
Rev. B. F. Huddeison of tit-no, Nov., the
church's tirst pastor, and Rev. S. C.
Keetch, it? present pastor, clasped each :
other by the right hand, and with their
lefts took hold of the old mortgage, drop
ping It Into the burning While
the ancient and liquidated instrument was
being consumed mgre- |

Closer Watch Over Specials.
OAKLAND. Oct. I.â Beginning with to
night the thirteen special policemen in
this city will be required to report to the
night captain four times durinp the night
in accordance with an order Issued by
Chief of Police Horigkins a few , venlngs
ago. The Chief has concluded that closer
supervision over the specials will r>s :!t
in their being of more use to tho depart
ment. The new rule practically Increases
the city's regular police force of sixty-one
men to seventy-four. It is supposed tah
the recent trouble between Special Officer
Stewart and Attorney Josephs on a local
train from the mole late one night, when
the officer should have been on his beat \ n

order.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1899.
BERKELEY SALOONS
CLOSED FOR ONE DAY
To -Morrow May See the Wholesale
Arrest of All Liquor-Dealers
of the City.
BERKELEY, Oct. I.â Not a drop of
; liquor was sold in the university town to
! day. That is, the police were unable to
I find any one selling intoxicating drinks,
| and the saloon men say that every saloon
1 in the city was closed and no business
; was done. This is not, however, because
â¢ the liquor dealers intend to abide by the
law, which closes their doors and makes
; their traffic illegal. It was because the
I day was Sunday, and none of them was
willing to stay in jail over night. To
* morrow they will begin their business
, again in full blast, and every one of them
la prepared to follow Marshal Lloyd to
; jail as soon as he can conveniently place
i them all under arrest.
To-day the mur.ii ipal ordinance making
Berkeley ;i prohibition town went into
The ordinance makes it unlawful
for any one to sell intoxicating Liquors
within the corporate limits of the city.
It was passed at the instance of the tem
perance workers in the city, who agreed
to pay the Board of Trustees a sum of
money equal to that received from saloon
licenses annually. Now they have the
ta?k on hand of Â«eeing the ordinance en
fun-ed, and judging from appearances the
task will not ke an easy one.
Although the saloon men in West Berke
ley closed their doors to-day and persist
ently refused all overtures to sell liquor,
they are prepared to fight the ordinance
to "the bitter end." It appears to be a
question of money and legal talent as to
which side is going to win. The Berkeley
men are not fighting single-handed, for
their cause hats been taken up by the
Wholesale Liquor Dealers' Association.
The latter organization sent out its rep
resentatives to West Berkeley this after
noun and laid down $3500 in cash to help
the tight along. The saloon men them
selves have raised $500, making a total of
14000 with which to begin hostilities to
morrow.
Marshal Lloyd and his deputies are also
preparing for the fray, as they expert
to-morrow will be a busy day for them.
They will be on hand at West Berkeley
early in the morning, and every liquor,
dealer found violating the ordinance will i
be arrested.

MYSTERIOUS AND
BOLD ROBBERY
OF DIAMONDS
Alameda Police Are
Puzzled.

ATTORNEY JAMES THE LOSER

HIS RESIDENCE ENTERED IN
BROAD DAYLIGHT.
The Fact That Visitors Were at the
James Home Did Not Appear
to Hinder the Sly
Burglar.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. l.
The police authorities of Alameda City
are greatly puzzled over a mysterious
I diamond ro-bbery, reported to them by
! H. K. James, an attorney and former
j newspaper man of New York City, resid
] ing at 1452 Caroline street, in the Enclnal
; city.
The robbery was committed in broad
i daylight the time chosen by the perpe
-1 tra'tors being between 2:40 and 3:30 i. 'clock
yesterday afternoon while -Mrs. James
: was away from her home on a hurry er
rand. What adds mystery to the rob
; bery is the fact that Mrs. James had s<-v
-' eral lady visitors from across the bay
during the afternoon, and they were lett
to make themselves at home in <>ne of the
upstairs rooms while Mrs. James went
I out on hor errand.
The most valuable of the property
Btolen comprises three diamond rings, the
estimated value of which is placed by
Mr. ami Mrs. James at $-t::r>. One of the
, rings was a solitaire another a three
stone cluster and the third a diamond
with a ruby.
The jewelry was kept on a bureau in a
! bedchamber on the lower floor and was
last seen there by Mrs. James when she

returned about half an hour later they
were gone.
Mrs. Jamfs states that she left the
' front door open when she went out, not
'â  dreaming of a possibility that any one
j would dare burglarize the place while
| visitors were there to detect any
j suspicious noises or movements. How
l-ever, Mrs. James' guests knew nothing
i of the robbery until after she had in
j formed them.
What adds still further mystery to the
i affair is that a very valuable gold watch
I belonging to Mr. James, besides a small
amount of money which lay near the
â  rings, was overlooked by the thief.
The police are investigating the affair,
but have thus far found no clew that may
' lead to the identification of the robber.
PRESIDENT WHEELER
EXPECTED MONDAY
His Home Decorated With Flowers by
thÂ« Associated Women Students
of the University.
BERKELEY, Oct. Lâ President Benja
mln Ide Wheeler of the University of
California did not come over to the uni- j
i versity town to-day. His first visit to the I
university as head of the faculty will not j
be made till to-morrow. As yet no hour |
1 has been set for his arrival, so that the '
i students will make no attempt at any
. demonstration when he reaches here. It
i is thought that when he comes over the
! bay to-morrow It will be to take up his
. residence in his home on Bushne.ll place.
Anticipating his arrival the women stu
dents 01 the university, through the offi
cers of the Associated Women Students,
have decorated the house tastefully with
(lowers. They also sent (lowers to the
I president's rooms upon his arrival in San
Francisco yesterday.
President Wheeler said in an interview
in fcian Francisco to-day that he has no
radical change to make nor any particular
I policy to announce which will materially
: affect the existing order of things at the
university. As the university is now sup- i
; ported by tuition fees or by endowment j
lie depends on the people oil the State to]
act generously toward it and has no doubt I
'< that they will moot every reasonable and '
' sensible obligation in this respect as they *
i have done heretofore. Owing to the geo- i
graphical position of California on the |
I Pacific and the new and extensive inter- i
ests we have acquired across the sea.Â«.
Professor Wheeler believes thai mwr<"- at
tention should be paid to the study of!
i diplomacy and the other requisites "that ;
i go to fit a man for the consular service,
: and consequently it may not be long be- 1
| fore such a department will be estab
l llshed in Berkeley, which will fit young '
, men for the great trade obligations* with I
i foreign Governments they may soon be ;
! called upon to assume. In this conncori <n
it is possible that the study of the Orl- ;
i ental languages may also receive a boom.
Professor Wheeler Is a firm believer in
and a strong advocate of athletics, par
ticularly free athletics. That is, athletics !
of the out-of-door sort. He thinks it
makes better men of the students and has ;
; much to do with the improvement of col- |
! lege morals as well as college physique. I
| He will do all that lies in his power to I
! promote the love of good, clean sport j
I among the boys as long as It does not
seriously interfere with their studied. !
! President Wheelpr Fa;., that he thought
| the opportunities for good rowing re
' gattas were excellent on this coast and
; he could not understand why greater at
j tention had not been given to that branch |
of sport, especially when the beneficial re- j
j suits which accrue from It arc so well |
i known. He will, as soon as ho has a i
little time to spare, see if something can- :
not be done to promote this pastime at :
the university and make California's col- i
lege men a? famous on the water as they j
! now are in all the other branches of
j manly exercise.
j In conclusion the professor said that the ;
University of California ranked very high
among the colleges of the country and
enjoyed among the people of the East "a
j reputation second to none."

PERFORMANCE
OF MINKOWEKY'S
ROMANTIC OPERA
All interested In musical affairs will re
j member J. Minkowsky, whose dramatij
! opera, "The Smugglers of Badayez," was
i purchased by the Bostonians in this city
; last summer. No doubt many of those
i have often wondered what became of
: Mr. Minkowsky and his opera. The
I reason news has been rather slow con
cerning it was owing to the length of
rehearsals and the time occupied in finish
ing an orchestra. The favorable com
i ments In the New York press now follow
i the announcement that the Bostonians
| will open their season In Boston this
! evening, and in the repertoire is to be
found Mr. Minkowsky's work.
No better place than Boston could have
been selected lor the first production of
| this new work, as that city is not only re
| garded as the most musical in America,
I but the critics are able and very just, and
! the composers will be given a fair chance.
:In all probability "The Smugglers of
! Badayez" will form the central attrac
tion of this season of the Bostonians. In
asmuch as Mr. Minkowsky was "dls
| covered" In San Francisco and has a
number of relatives residing here,
musicians and music lovers of this city
will be very anxious to hear of the suc
cess of this work. I have no doubt that
it will receive the sanction of the Boston
critics. z
Mr. Holt, organist of Grace Church, be
ing unable to attend to his duties because
of a severe Indisposition, Theodore Vogt
has been selected to act in the organist's
place. Mr. Vogt is a very able musician,
having composed a number of songs
among which one entitled "Allah Gives
I>ight in Darkness" deserves special at
tention. It is a magnificent work. Mr.
Vogt will also conduct the monthly festl
val er vices.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H
â¢ â¢
Among the interesting concerts of this
season will be that of Miss Jessie Foster,
who commands a remarkably high range.
The date is October 10.
ALFRED METZGAR.
FIRST NIGHT
A THE NEW
CALIFORNIA
A large, willing, good-natured, happy
audience tilled the California Theater last
night to applaud Ben Hendricks in "A
Yenulne Yentleman," and they did to the
echo. The play cannot be accepted us an j
ideal even of its kind (.an old-time melo
diaina in spite of the programme), and no
one need be overstocked with penetration
to follow its wandering drift through four |
arts of realism and Irrelevancy, in the end
bringing nothing in particular to pass.
Apart trom the play, Ben llendricks is a
host in himself and perhaps no one is
better able to Interpret the vagaries and
cleverness of the educated Swede than he.
He is imbued with the, character and has
but to .speak to create a laugh. In the
matter of dialogue he has about all there
Is of value In the play, for the author's
reach for cleverness went little beyond
his part. There is a minglement of the
nations, singly represented, for the sake
of color and specially, but Cordelia |
O'Grudy, an played by Mapgie beclair, is
the only one above the commonplace. She
is a real lady from Tipperary, the best I
have ever seen, and Jt is a pity she has
not more to do. The cast contains a very
clever vaudeville artist, Miss Bertie Con
way, who sings coon songs, new ones,
with a dash and vim that ear an easy en
core. Most of the men in the play lack
the gift of experience, and it takes an
artist to save unnatural, absurd situations
with the needed grace. The scenery Is :
excellent, that in the first act, a ship
scene, having a truly remarkable and
bpautiful distance effect. In spite of ac
cumulated lacks, there is enough in Hen- i
dricks. Miss Conway and Miss Tveclair to
make the evening one of amusement and
satisfaction, even though the apropos
of a bright new interior for the Yentle
man's reception is somewhat lost.

THIRTY-SECOND
INFANTRY OFF TO
THE PHILIPPINES
Glenogle and Nelson
Depart.
LARGE CROWD ON THE FRONT
â¦ â â
CHEERED ON THEIR WAY TO
THE DISTANT WAR.
Â«
One Thousand Officers and Men Go
Forth Cheerfully to Do Battle
With the Dusky
Islanders.
Nine companies of the Thirty-second
Regiment of Infantry, accompanied by
I Colonel Louis A. Craig, his staff and the
regimental band, sailed yesterday after
| noon for Manila on two transports, the
i Glenogle and the Charles Nelson. There
were about 1000 officers and men on the
i two ship?. Colonel Craig and the band
j and seven companies were on the Olen
| oglo. Two companies commanded by Major
j Cabell, sailed on the Charles Nelson. The
j Glenogle got away about 4 o'clock. The
Nelson did not start for some hours after
ward. Ail day the embarking soldiers had
their share of attnetion. In the morning
the regiment marched down Market
street to East, and went on the transport
wharf, where they were given their Quar
ters and were left to wait for the ebb
tide in the afternoon.
The music gathered a crowd that was
continually increased until the wharves
near the transport wharf contained many
thousand spectators. The sailing of ihe
Glenugle was accompanied by many dem- !
onstraiions of friendliness for the soldiers, i
Whistles were blown and the crowds
i cheered and waved their handkerchiefs j
1 until the steamer, describing a large cir- <
I cle 1n its course, was well over toward
! Goat Island, on its seaward way. The
i band on the steamer played "Dixie" and
other patriotic tunes. When the "Star- '
i spangled Banner" was played the British j
| tlag at the stern of the ship was dipped.
Upon the Glenogle were the following
officers and men: Colonel L<ouis A. Craig,
Lieutenant Colonel Louis H. Strother,
Major Frank C. Armstrong, surgeon;
First Lieutenant W. H. Cook, assistant
surgeon; captain and adjutant, George T.
Summerlin; captain and quartermaster,
Edwin J. Griffith; first lieutenant and
commissary, George A. Densmore; cap
tains, John P. Grimstead, Frank M. Rum
bold, Jacob H. Culver and Granville Sle
ver; first lieutenants, John M. Shook,
James L. Long, Ambrose C. G. Williams,
Foote, Joseph C. Hixson, William S.
Mapes; second lieutenants, George H.
Armltage. Charles R. W. Morison, Henry
K. Love, Charles H. Wilson and Henry E.
Slack; companies E, G, L, A, b , X and M
and the regimental band. There were
about thirty officers and 725 men on the
Glenogle.
The officers and men on the Nelson were
as follows: Major Cabell. commanding; Dr.
Hereford of the hospital corps; Lieuten
ant Schaeffer, adjutant; Captains Reed
and Comfort; Lieutenants Phillips, Rals
ton and Miller; Second Lieutenant Charles
L. Ballard, Eleventh Cavalry, U. S. V.; j
Second Lieutenant Arthur P. Watts,
Fourth Infantry; Second Lieutenant Wil
lis P. Coleman. Ninth 'Infantry; Second
Lieutenant Richmond Smith, Twelfth In
fantry; Second Lieutenant Dupont B.
Lyon, Sixteenth Infantry; Second Lieu
tenant Henry M. Bankhead, Twentieth
Infantry; Second Lieutenant Lewis Ad
mire, Twenty-second Infantry; Second
Lieutenant James M. Petty, Thirty-sixth
Infantry, U. S. V. ; Second Lieutenant
John T^ Fuller, Thirty-seventh Infantry,
U. S. V. ; Second Lieutenant Reuben V.
Bat&ette, Thirty-seventh Infantry, and
two companies of the Thirty-second In
fantry.
Just before the Glenogle sailed a small
boy, about 12 years old, presented him
self to Colonel Craig and said: "Colonel,
are you carrying any boys to Manila?"
The colonel answered in the affirmative
but dashed the hopes of the would-be
juvenile warrior by saying:
"We have enough boys already."
This staggered the lad for an instant
only, lie pulled from his pocket a let
ter*and held it up before the colonel and !
Bald:
"That shows that I have come all the
way from Fort Leavenworth with you j
and I want to go all the way with the
regiment."
The colonel fixed a steplly pair of eyes j
on the youngster and reminded him that
he was the lad who had been ordered out !
of camp some days ago.
"Now," Bald the colonel, "if you try to !
stow yourself away and I find you, I will ,
put you adrift, if it is in the middle of the
ocean."
Then the lad turned away, but was !
overheard to say that he would take the
chances of being discovered. It is very
probable that he went as a stowaway and \
he may be landed next at Honolulu, where j
the ship will stop to coal.
STRANGER IN HIS ROOM.
Pettigrew Missed His Purse After the
Man Had Vanished.
Andrew Pettigrew, 21 Hawthorne street,
was awakened about 8 o'clock yesterday
morning hy a noise in his bedroom. He
saw a man in the room and asked him
what he wanted.
B"Does Mr. Ellis live here?" asked the ;
stranger, and Pettigrew replied that he
did not, and told the intruder to get out.
After the man left Pettigrew discovered
that a purse containing $13 and two gold
rings had been stolen from the top of
the bureau. He hurriedly dressed and
found the stranger in a saloon close by
drinking steam beer with a woman. He I
accused him of stealing the purse and
sent for a policeman. The stranger, who
proved to be John T. Hyland. a cook on
a coasting vessel, dropped the purse on
the floor, whr-re the officer who called
and arrested him discovered it,
and hooked it as evidence against Hyland.
Pettigrew's front door had not been
locked and that was why Hyland's en
trance was made easy. Hyland, of course,
denied stealing the purse, and said he had
no occasion to steal, as he was paid off
Saturday and had plenty of money. When :
searched about $3 was found on him. He
was booked on a charge of burglary.

SOUTHERN PACIFIC TRAIN LEAVES
A BLOODY TRAIL AT SUNNYSDE
THE mopt frightful of all the recent
accidents on the Southern Pacific
occurred last evening at Sunnyside
crossing, when the San Jose local
; crashed into a cart containing the family
.of Lorenzo Chardella. The father and
one little daughter were killed outright,

'." should have been, several minutes before
7 be train reached the crossing Chardella
could not have passed onto the track,
fTrnE'lf and daughter would not have been
â Wiled and his wife and boy had ..netr lives
â  endangered.
K>t -witnesses of the terrible accident
Fay' Chardella was driving along the rail
iroad track when the San Jose train, which
left the Garden City at 5:30 o'clock, came
thundering along. The engineer, s.-oing
the cart a short distance ahea.d of the
train, quickly applied the brakes. He was
too late, however, to prevent the tragedy.
The helpless occupants were violently
thrown from their seats and the cart was
completely wrecked.
Chardella and his little girl were found
in a ditch alongside the track. Mrs. Char
della and her infant child were picked up
a short distance from the spot where the
husband and daughter lay dying. Assist
ance was rendered at once, but before the
victims of the awful accident could be
removed to the City and County Hospital
Chardella and his little daughter breathed
their last.
Mrs. Chardella and her little boy were
placed in the patrol wagon, which had
been sent from the Seventeeenth Btreet
station, and hurriedly conveyed to the
hospital.
The Indies of Chardella and his daugh
ter, which were taken to the Morgue,
were mangled almost beyond recogni
tion. The girl's skull was fractured
Jn several places and her right leg was
broken. Thyre were also many abrasions
on her body. Chardella's neck waa
broken, his skull was fractured ajid his
right arm and left leg were badly shat
tered.
Mrs. Chardella was also severely in
jured, her body being cut and bruised In
various places. Fortunately her baby In
BJms escaped with a few body brulse-s.

YOUNG AERONAUT
FALLS HEADLONG
TO HIS DEATH
â Frightful Accident at
Glen Park.
'ALBERT M'PHERSON DYING
BIS PARACHUTE BAR CATCHES
IN OVERHANGING WIRES.
Jt Was the Boy's Second Attempt at
Ballooning, and It Is Not
Likely That He Will
Recover.
An accident happened yesterday after
jioon that will probably result in the
death of Albert McPherson, a young aero
naut, who was making a balloon ascen-
Bion from Glen Park with the intention of
doing a parachute leap to earth.
It was McPherson's second balloon as
cension, he having last Sunday made a
successful parachute jump from a balloon
rel< ased from Glen Park. Success at the
!irst 'attempt gave him confidence, and
yesterday h<- declared himself in the busl
for keeps." A large crowd witnessed
his second and fatal trip, little thinking
that the career of the daring aeronaut
would be bo suddenly terminated.
As soon as the balloon was cut loose it
â was apparent to the crowd of spectators
that the tsas bag had not been sufficiently
iniiated to carry it to the necessary height
for a safe parachute descent. On its re
lease, the balloon having attained a height
oi about three hundred feet, young Mc-
Pherson started his aerial performance on
iln trapeze. The balloon almost im
itely commenced to descend. In
ng the big grove of gum trees near
the park entrance McPherson's feet
pe< mcd to touch their tops, and he was
to pull himself up to a sitting posi
tion on the liar.
Scarcely had the aeronaut passed the
trÂ«'<?s In safety when the balloon, still de
scending, carried him to the bridge, some
two hundred feet distant, where the bar
became entangled in the network of wires
overhead.
McPherson, apparently realizing his
danger, was seen to catch hold of one of
visited the Central police station shortly
after the accident and surrendered him
self to Captain Wittman. He was at once ,
taken to the City Prison and a charge
of manslaughter was recorded against
him. Shortly before midnight he was re-,
leased on his own recognizance by order j
of Judge Mogan.
"We pulled out of San Jose at r>:3"
o'clock." said Hurd. "The train was made
up of six cars anel was in charge of (',in
ductor E. B. Stanwood. "We were due in
this city at 7:30 p. m., and at the time of
the accident the train was speeding along I
at the rate of twenty miles an hour, j
When we reached Sunnyside T don't think j
we were going more than fifteen miles an
hour, as it was the rule to slow down
when nearing the crossing. Just before
reaching Sunnyside I save a long whis

of my employers. I also rang the bell
and kept a sharp lookout ahead. William
McGowan, my fireman, also looked out to 'â 
see if there was any obstruction on the
track.
"We both saw the cart at the same mo
ment. The rays of an electric light close
to the trark made It possible for us to
see the vehicle. We were then about sev
enty-five feet from Chardella and his fnm
lly. The driver, who afterward proved

however, was too much for him, and
though still holding the wire until It was

I through the air a distance of some twenty
; feet to the outside stringer of the bridge,
where he struck the heavy timber head
i first. : â .;â¢'â â :
Crowds soon surrounded the prostrate
I form, and a passing vehicle was pressed
j into service, the unconscious aeronaut be
j ing taken at full speed to St. Luke's Hos
pital.
While on the way to the hospital, and
at the summit of the hill at Chenery and
McGill streets, the brake of the wagon be
came caught and the horses ran down the
steep incline at a furious rate to Thir
tieth- street, where in turning a sharp
curve the wagon narrowly escaped being
capsized. -
At St. Luke's Hospital Dr. Edward C.
Van Dyke, the resident physician, found
that the entire front portion of McPher
i son's head had been fractured. The
: frontal bones were caved In and the brain
1 was undoubtedly contused. The aero
naut was In an unconscious- condition at
a late hour last night, bleeding from the
ears and giving no signs of improvement.
Daniel W. McPherson, the aged father
of the aeronaut, visited the hospital dur
ing- the evening and was very much af
fected at the condition, of his only son.
He said that the young man had been an
athlete for a number of years and was
connected with the Reliance and Acme
clubs of Oakland. His penchant for
ballooning was contrary to the wishes of
his father and mother, but he was am
bitious to make money and was told by
some friends that there was no danger.
McPherson is but 19 years of age. There
is not the slightest hope for his recovery.

ly changed his mind and continued in the

"Realizing that an accident was inevi
table, I did all in my power to stop the
train. The engine struck the roar end of
the cart. The next moment it came to a
standstill, and we started to lend what
ever assistance \\ could to the victims.
McGowan went hack to the rear of the
train and picked up Mrs. Chardella, who
seemed to have been fatally injured.
Chardella and his little daughter were
lying in a ditch alongside of the track.
They were still breathing, but died a
short time afterward.
"It sems to me that Chardella was to
blame for the accident. He had ample
time to get "ff the track, but for some
reason he made no effort to do so. I
suppose he temporarily lost his head, so
overcome was he by the approaching
train. I have been with the railroad
company for some time and this is the
lirst serious accident that I have had.
Two years ago I was in charge e>f a local
train which, by reason of a faulty switch.
collided with a race-track train. Fortu
nately no lives were lost, due to my cool
ness and prompt action. I keenly feel for
Chardella and his family, but I do not
think that I was to blame in any way."
E. D. Stan wood, the conductor in charge
of the train, was also seen on his arrival i
In this city. He declined to discuss the '
accident, or to give any information about 1
it.
E. M. Stevens, the flagman at the cross
ing, says that he saw the cart approach
ing and yelled to the driver to steip. The !
horse attached to the> vehicle was trotting i
along until just before reaching the track, I
when it slackened its speed into a walk. '
"I concluded that the driver had pulled
up the horse when it slowed down," said
Stevens, "but when I saw the animal
suddenly make a spurt across the track
I yelled to Chardella to look out for the

train. Despite my warning, he turned the
horse's head and started to drive down
the track. Just then the engine came
along and struck the rear end of the cart.
The unfortunate family was hurled in
the air and how Mrs. Chardella and her
baby escaped being killed seems miracu
lous, to say the least."
Formerly, thf railroad company had
gatfs at the crossing as a precautionary
measure, but for some reason they have
not been in working order for some time.
It is claimed that the roadbed at Sunny
side was turn up about six weeks ago,
making it impossible to properly utilize
the gates. This is given as the main rea
son why the gates were not closed at the
time of the accident.
The doctors at the hospital did not deem
it advisable to tell Mrs. Chardella about
the >k-ath of her husband and child. She
is still suffering from the shock, and it is
feared that if she is apprised of the fatal
results of the accident it might result
seriously for her. When asked for her
version of the accident she said that her
husband heard the approach of the train
and vainly endeavored to cross the track.
"We were on our way home," Mrs.
Chardella said, when telling the story of
the accident. "When within a few feet
of the railroad track I noticed the train
approaching and shouted to my husband
to get out of its way. He whipped up the
horse and started to cross the track. When
the train was within a short distance my
husband suddenly turned the horse and
started to drive down the track. The next
instant the train struck us and I found
myself lying in a ditch alongside the
tr:irk, with my baby In my arms.
"I hope my husband and, my little girl
are not seriously Injured,"' she tearfully
remarked. "I wish they would let me see

HE DEPRECATES
KISSING GAMES
AND FORFEITS
Rev. Dr. Shepard on
Church Socials.
â¦
PLEADS FOR RESTRICTIONS
â¢- â
HE SAYS THEY ARE TOO MUCH
UP TO DATE.
â¦
More of the Religious Spirit and Less
of the Lottery Plan Would
Meet With His
Ideas.
The modern church social was the sub
ject of a sermon last evening by Rev. H.
T. Shepard of the Olivet Congregational
Church, Noe and Seventeenth streets.
While not entirely opposed to the socials,
which are such a source of revenue to the
church, and the existence of which sur
rounds the pastor's salary with a degree
of certainty. Rev. Mr. Shepard admitted
that they had descended to frivolous af
fairs bordering on the sacrilegious.
Dr. Shepard discussed the church social
as a source of profit, recreation and
worship. He urged that some of the up
to-date ideas be eliminated from the af
fairs. The icecream and cake functions
and the entertainments with solemn mu
sic and pathetic recitations meet with his
unqualified approval as a means of in
creasing the church funds; but he posi
tively draws the line at the socials given
in the name of the church where kissing
games are the chief attractions and lot
tery schemes are the fad.
According to Dr. Shepard's ideas as
expressed from the pulpit last evening he
would not for the world do anything to
discourage the giving of church socials,
but he believed that from the manner in
which they are abused at the present day
they should be restricted and modified
and the mercenary spirit, which, he said,
is sometimes the controlling one, should
be corrected.
"When their errors are pointed out to
them the Christian people can be trusted
to remedy the evil," said Dr. Shep.ird,
"but they need to watch themselves.
Many church festivals have descended to
a plane of frivolity that is shameful, and
it is sacrilege to permit them to take
place in a house of worship. I deprecate
the extortion frequently practiced by the
ladies of the church while arranging festi
vals or socials. Merchants and business
men are often compelled to contribute
money or their wares under an implied
threat that if they do not their trade
will be injured. I believe that the busi
ness man should contribute to the church,
bill it certainly lowers the dignity of the
institution to literally force him to do so.
The church is an institution of protection
to him, but it becomes one of menace if
we allow the social to become an agency
for extortion.
"As conducted in the days of Christ and
the old Jewish church the social becomes
a part of and an advantage to our joyous
religious life. Aside from being a source
of pleasure it should have an elevating
and not a demoralizing tendency. Singing
and recitations, innocent games and re
freshments are the legitimate features of
the church festival, but we must stop
there. Games of forfeits where a kiss
from a young lady is the penalty or the
prize are out of place in a house of wor
ship." ______________
OARSMEN ON THE ESTUARY.
Alameda Boating Club Holds a Suc
cessful Rowing Regatta and
Ladies' Day.
Boating: men enjoyed a g?.la day on
j Oakland Creek yesterday. There was a
'. fresh breeze, and many sloops and canoes
j spread their -white wings on the estuary.
The Alameda Club's boathouse was
crowded with oarsmen and their friends,
among the latter being many ladies.
There were several rowing events, the
principal one being the annual race for
the junior championship of the club in
outrigger skiffs. For this there were
eight entries, drawn in four heats. The
distance was a mile and a half with a
turn, and it was arranged that the It >
i scullers making the fastest time should
! pull in the linal heat. The first heat was
i between E. M. Hunter and E. S. Halman.
Hunter led to the stake and maintained
I his advantage to the finish, his time be
ing 12 minutes and 4t! 2-5 seconds. HaJ
man's time was 12 minutes and 57 2-5 sec
onds. In the second heat between E. T.
Thorning and C. J. Hague, the latter se
j cured the best of the start. A neck and
neck race ensued to the turn, where
Thorning assumed the lead and kept it
j to the finishing line. The winner's lime
\ was 13 minutes and 2 seconds, and the
! loser's 14 minutes. In the third heat be-
I tween Nanowa Brown and H. S. Green
well the former led over the whole course
and won easily in 13 minutes and 49 sec
| onds. In the fourth heat B. G. Guild and
i Edward Edwards started together, and
neither had any decided advantage for
the first one and a Quarter miles, when
Guild forged ahead and won in 13 minutes
and 27 seconds. The final heat between
E. M. Hunter and E. S. Halman was a
close one. Hunter won by two lengths
in 13 minutes nnd 1-5 second.
In the pie-eating contest the eompeti
i tors had to pull out for about 100 yards
I from the float and return, having eaten
I two pies. The efforts of the contestants,
James GreenweU and George Lewis, to
dispose of the pies were amusing. Lewis
won, as GreenweU rowed home without
consuming the whole of his allotted pies.
A dash of one-eighth of a mile in out
rigger skiffs between S. J. Pembroke and
B. G. Guild was won by the former by
half a length. The senior barge crew
gave an exhibition row over the course.
Refreshments were served in the boat-

"GLAD HAND MAC" RETURNS
The Genial Southern Pacific Official
Disclaims Any Desire for
Political Honors.
Suffering from a bad cold and a sense
of personal injury. Passenger Traffic
Manager E. O. McCormick of the South
ern Pacific Company, also known as
"Glad Hand Mac." arrived at the Palace
Hotel last night from his recent trip to
Salt Lake. Notwithstanding the physical
and mental disadvantages under which
Mr. McCormick labored, he was the same
cheery, jovial passer of the old "jolly"
which has made him so popular since his
advent on the coast, and, though he had
but a minute to spare before retiring to
his room, he managed to get two funny
stories and an emphatic denial of any
political ambition into that short space of
time.
"No," said Mr. McCormick, "I am not
out here to do politics and never had the
slightest idea of entering the political
field in any way. My business is to take
care of the traffic of the Southern Pacific
Company, and I have no time for any
thing else. Any report to the contrary
is all rot and founded on whole cloth.
I'll be pleased to see you gentlemen
around at my office as often as you care
to come, and if you ever hear any such
stories in the future all you have to do
is to come to me and the information I
will give you will be dead straight. I
absolutely 'repudiate the story, repudiate
it with both hands, the glad band and
the other one as well.
"We have made a change in our running
time which calls for two extra over
land trains each day in addition to those
now in operation. One of the new trains
will leave here at about S o'clock in the
morning and the other will arrive at
about 5:15 in the afternoon. In addition
the 7 o'clock morning train, which now
runs only as far as Redding, will be ex
tended to cover the gap between that
point and Roseberg. and will thereby be
come a through train to Portland. The
Portland train, which now stops at
Roseberg, will be extended in the same
manner to run through to this city."
