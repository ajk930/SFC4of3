WHAT THE WARFARE IN SOUTH AFRICA HAS
COST GREAT BRITAIN UP TO DATE.
In Twenty Days of Hostilities
With the Boers the English
Have Lost More Troops Than
Did America During the
Whole War With Spain.
LONDON, Nov. 2 â In the twenty days of hostilities in
South Africa the British army has lost more men in Killed
and wounded and captured than the American army lost
in the entire war with Spain. W^ile the bulK of the British
iosses is due to the capture of General White's left wing at
Ladysmith, the total of dead and wounded has already
reached high figures.
Only four less British officers have been K'Hcd th>an were
lost by the American forces in the recent conflict with
Spain. The number of British) soldiers Killed is already
n)ore than half of that of the United States troops- Esti
mating at 1000 the number in tbe captured coluri)n at Lady
smith and quoting official figures for other losses in the
American and British armies, the comparison stands as
fallows:
America (entire war) â Killed, 23 officers, 255 men;
wounded, 113 officers, 1456 men; captured, none. Total,
1847.
British (thus far) â Killed, 19 officers, 137 men; wounded,
61 officers. 492 roen; captured, officers and men, 1207.
Total, 1915.

FRENCH SOCIETY TO AID TRANSVAAL.
I'ARIS, Nov. I.â A society has been founded to render assistance to the
Transvaal Government. Colonel Monteil is president and Francois <V>ppe,
Jules L^maitre, Henri Rochefort and Drumont, proprietor of Libre Parole,
are right honorary presidents.
The organization is enrolling volunteers to fight for the Boers, and the
promoters claim that more than 300 have volunteered. They have difficulty,
however, in finding the necessary funds, and it is doubtful whether I>r.

which is in the hands of the most violent section of the Nationalists and the
Anti-Semites, may collapse.

The battery mules soon followed
with the whole gun equipment.
The gallantry of the troops
was superb. At once they fixed
bayonets and seized the neigh
boring hill. There they were oc
cupied till dawn constructing de
fenses. There was little molesta

when the enemy received strong
reinforcements and pressed terri

found their ammunition at an

the attacking force paid dearly for
its success. It is due to the Boers
to remember that they treated the

STARS AND STRIPES IN SOUTH AFRICA.
On the hank of the Sabi River and the main road from Delagoa Ray to the Lydenburgh gold mines Is a store
kept by an American named Jordan. On a pole in front of the store the stars and stripes are raised each morning
at sunrise and lowered at sunset. At this point Portuguese and Transvaal territory meet; It Is capable of being
Btrongly fortified, and may be the scene of a battle in the near future. Jordan was born in New York City, and his
boyhood was pasÃed on the Bowery. He emigrated to South Africa nearly thirty years ago and established himself in
this location, where he has accumulated a handsome fortune. The picture is from a sketch made by J. Harrington
of this city.

with the monopolization of the available
telegraph line? by the Government and
British staff officers, in responsible for the
fact that nothing further has arrived

received dispatches rectifying: the casual

Up to midnight nothing had been re

The War Office officials are working under
great strain. Captain Perriott, staff cap

died, his end being hastened by anxiety
and overwork.
An unconfirmed statement is published
that Sir Redvers Buller has left Cape
Town for Ladyamlth.
A belated dispatch from I,advsmith, de
scribing Monday's fight, says: "A couple
nf squadrons of Hussars bad a narrow es
cape from disaster early in the day. They
found themselves suddenly fronted, with
in easy range, by an overwhelming force
of Boers, who seemed to spring from the
bowels 'if the earth. The hussars were
splendidly handled, and were extricated
with only one man wounded."
The Queen is credited with expressing
Bincere pity for Sir George Stewart White,
and the officials are in no wise inclined to
judge him harshly. So far as the public Is
concerned, however, while gratification is
felt at the manner in which the isolated
battalions surrendered, there is still se
BRITISH STATESMEN SPEAK
OF THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA
Lord Hamilton Declares England Is Not in Quest of
Profit, but Is Fighting fop the Common
Benefit of Mankind,
LONDON. Nov. l.â Lord George Hamilton, Secretary of
Btate for India, speaking at Baling this evening regard
ing the situation in South Africa, paid: "Our ultimate
victory Ifl certain, and when the terms which we as vic
tors will propose to the vanquished are known foreign
nations will see that the main cause which has forced ua to
embark upon this conflict is not a desire of pecuniary profit nor
. l territorial aggrandisement, hut a determination to emanci
pate a vast territory for the common benefit of mankind from
an Ignoble and degrading tyranny."
The Earl of Belborne, Under Secretary of the Colonies,
Bpeaking at Dumfries, said: "It is not the fault of the states
men of the Transvaal that wo have not become embroiled with
some European power. If hostilities had not come when they
did they would have come at some moment of national danger
and difficulty."
Baron Tweedmouth, former Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury, speaking at Edinburgh, said: "The public mind has
not been so moved since the news of the dreadful events of the
Indian mutiny. We unfortunately are warring with a nation of
the same stock and religion as ourselves. At this crisis all
hearts go out to the brave Boers and to the small British army
in Natal, which against fearful odds has performed magnificent
features of valor. It is not the time to call our opponents
names or to utter cries of vengeance, but to back up her Ma
jesty's Ministers, who have a fearful, yes, an awful responsi
bility upon their shoulders."
The Earl oÂ£ Carrinuton. Liberal. Boeaklne at Buckingham.
j vere criticism of General White and Lieu
tenant Colonel Carleton for allowing the
I column to got out of touch, for the ab
sence of proper scouting? and for not retir
ing when the ammunition was lost. In
favor of Lieutenant Colonel Carleton the
explanation is hazarded that he believed it
was imperative to the success of General
White's operations that he should hold
1 the position at Nicholsons Nek.
The Morning Post comments severely
! upon the British contempt for the enemy,
as shown by the belief that the large Boer
] force at Acton Homes could be held in
I check by Carleton's small column. It
] points out that even if the British there
had been supplied with ammunition, they
could have held out only a few hours
longer, Inasmuch as they were in the most
complete sense detached, and because no
body apparently at J.adysmlth had any
: idea of their distress or took any meas
ures to rescue them.
"The column was sacrificed," says the
: Morning Post. "becau*o it was sent into
action gagged and Â^:<idÂ£ f >!<itK'- . , It had
! neither scout nor patrol. Twelve hundred
men were thrown away for lack of cav
alry which would not have been missed
from another part of the field."
The Standard, which comments in simi
j lar terms upon "the fact that General
White made no effort to extricate the col
umn from the impossible situation into
which he had thrust it," draws a sad pic
ture of the men "hoping for relief and
then realizing with bitterness of heart
that some one had blundered, that they
had been forgotten by their general and
his staff, and that nothing was left but
surrender and imprisonment at Pretoria
! until the end of the war."
The Daily Chronicle says: "It is evident
that somebody blundered, but more details
are required before the blame can be ap
portioned."
BRITONS YET WORRIED.
LONDON, Nov. Lâ The gloom caused ]
by the British disaster at Ladysmith was
In a measure relieved by to-day's story j
< giving an account of the heroic stand
: made by the decimated battalions until :
their last cartridges were gone. The
British nerve was momentarily shaken
! by General White's use of the word "oa- ;
, pitulate" in his Brat telegram, but now j
> that it is known that the Gloucesters and i
Fualleera fought against overwhelming
odds and upheld the host traditions of the
British army the tension has been re
lieved, since there is no longer any
ground to dread that the loss of life was
accompanied by dishonor,
The details to-day show the catastro
phe in a brighter aspect. The full bat
talions were imi engaged and therefore
the list of prisoners is materially reduced,
while the disaster now appears to have
been not so much the consequence of de
fects in the plan of action as to a mis
fortune whereby the column was deprived
of Its ammunition. Still, it seems incom
prehensible why the plight of the luck- I

quarters, as the scene of the surrender
was only about three miles northwest of I
gave expression to virtually the same' convictions.
The Earl of Lonsdale, honorary colonel of the Third Bat
talion, border regiment, at a banquet this evening at "White
Haven, declared his confidence In General White, the British
commander In Natal, and predicted a grand review in Pre
toria next March. Referring to Emperor William's celebrated
telegram to President Kroger at the time of the failure of the
Jameson raid. Lord Lonsdale said: "If his Majesty's dispatch
had been rightly understood it would have had a totally dif
ferent effect. It was sent with a view of alleviating two sores.
It was not antagonistic to Great Britain. I have the pleasure
to know the views of the German Emperor and they are in
accordance with the views of England."
EDINBURGH, Nov. I.â Lord Rosebery. toasting the "Army
and Navy" at a banquet given this evening by the Lord Pro
vost of Edinburgh to the officers of the Gordon Highlanders
and the Scots Greys, referred to the reverse in Natal and said:
"It Is much to be regretted, but in a considerable campaign we
must look out for such incidents. It is not in the nature of
Britons to take much notice of them. We, have had a good
many of the same kind and have generally got out right in
the end. But 'whatever, happens we must see this thing
through, even if it should cost still more battalions and still
more millions. Some- day there will be an Inquisition as to the
preparations made for this , war, but the time for that is not
now. Our duty now Is to support those who have the direction
of affairs."
Ladysmith, and Lieutenant Colonel Oarl
ton must h;L\e expected relif-f to reach
liim or instead of attempting to occupy
a defensive position he would have re
traced his steps to Ladysmith when he
suffered the loss of his ammunition.
Apart from General White's statement
that the losses are very numerous there
is nothing to indicate the extent of them
except a vague report that the soldier
who brought the news to Ladysmith said
the British dead and wounded were lying
in heaps and that hundreds needed doc
tors. This, however, is hardly borne out
by the long list of captured officers.
' The concluding sentence of General
j White's dispatch relative to the safety
j of Ladysmith was received here with a
certain reserve in view of the fact that
similar official assurances were given re
cently at Dundee and Glencoe, and there
. is intense anxiety for news of the re
newed attack, which is not mentioned in
! the dispatches.
The calamity ha? served ..to alarm thÂ«Â».
British and their friends. The papers
i comment on the splendid reserve of
patriotism existing in the far-away col
onies and ; the deep-seated feeling of
friendship and sympathy of the great
kindred nation across the Atlantic.

FOUGHT UNTIL THEIR
AMMUNITION WAS GONE
According to General White s Report the
British Troops Battled Gamely Until
Captured by the Boers.
LONDON, Nov. I.â The British war Office to-day mnr!f> public a dispatch re
ceived from General White, describing the operations of Monday. It follows:
"Ladysmith, Oct. 31, 7:30 p. m.â l took out from Ladysmith a brigade of
mounted troops, two brigade divisions of the Royal Artillery, the Natal
Field Battery and two brigades of Infantry, to reconnoiter in force the ene
my's position to the north, and, if the opportunity should offer, to capture the
hill behind Farquhar's farm, which had on the previous day been held in strength
by the enemy. In connection with this advance a column consisting of the Tenth
Mountain Artillery, four half companies of the Gloucesters and six companies of
the Royal Irish Fusileers, the whole under Lieutenant Colonel Carlton and Major
Adye, deputy assistant adjutant gf-nernl, was dispatched at 11 p. m. on the 2Sth to
march by night up Bellspruit, and seize Nicholsons Nek, or some position near
Nicholsons Nek, thus turning the enemy's right flank. The main advance was
successfully carried out, the objective of the attack being found evacuated, and
an artillery duel between our field batteries and the enemy's guns and Maxims is
understood to have caused heavy loss to the enemy. The reconnaissance forced
the enemy to fully disclose his position, and, after a strong counter attack on our
right, the infantry brigade and cavalry having been repulsed, the troops were
slowly withdrawn to camp, pickets beintr left on observation. Late in the en
gagement the naval contingent under Captain Lambton of her Majesty's steam
ship Powerful, came into action and silenced, with their extremely accurate tire,
the enemy's guns in position.
"The circumstances which attended the movement of Lieutenant Colonel Carl
ton's column are not yet fully known, but from reports received the column ap
pears to have carried out the night march unmolested until within two miles of
Nicholsons Nek. At this point big boulders rolled from the hill and a few rifle
shots stampeded the military ammunition mules. The stampede spread to the
battery mules, which broke loose from their leaders and got away with practically
the whole of the gun equipment and the greater portion of the regimental small
arm ammunition. The reserve was similarly lost.
"The infantry battalions, however, fixed bayonets and. accompanied by the
personnel of the artillery, seized a hill on the left of the road, two miles from the
Nek, with but little opposition. Thero they remained unmolested until dawn, the
time being occupied in organizing the defense of the hill and constructing stone
sangars and walls as cover from lire. At dawn a skirmishing attack on our posi
tion was commenced by the enemy, but made no way until 9:30 a. m., when rein
forcements enabled them to rush to the attack with â¢ -eat energy. Their fire be
came very searching and two companies of the Gloucesters. in an advanced posi
tion, were ordered to fall back. The enc-my then pressed to short range, the losse3
on our side becoming very numerous.
"At 3 p. m. our -ammunition wa.s practically exhausted, the position was cap
tured and the survivors of the column fell into the enemy's hands. The enemy
treated our wounded with great humanity, General Joubert at once dispatching a
letter to me offering a safe conduct to doctors and ambulances to remove the
wounded. A medical officer and parties to render first aid to the wounded were
dispatched to the scene of action from Ladysmith last night, and the ambulance at
dawn mis morning.
"The want of success of the column was due to the misfortune of the mulea
stampeding and the consequent loss of the guns and small-arm ammunition re
serve. The official list of casualties and prisoners will be reported shortly. The
latter are understood to have been sent by rail to Pretoria. The security of Lady
smith is in no way affected."

TRYING TO SETTLE
SAMOAN QUESTION
Three Powers Continue
Negotiations.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
LONDON, Nov. l.â While the Bamoan
; negotiations continue it can be said defi
nitely that they are in such a condition
that there is small possibility of reaching
an agreement in the near future. The
United States has notified the Foreign
Office that it heartily indorses the propo
sition for the government of Samoa by
lone power, but that bo far no plan has
| been suggested which appears satisfac
tory to ii.' United States. â¢
\\ AbHijNGION, Nov. i.â The negotia
tions lor the partition of the uamoan Isl
! anas are proceeding rapidiy, ana omciala
' here, would not ti< BUiprjaed ;i 8 tinal
agreement were reached in the near, fu
ture. '1 he discussion wnieh is going on
in London with the coroperatioii "i the
authorities here and in ran has brought
out certain essential features on wiitcii
all three powersâ Britain, Germany
and the United Statesâ appear to be
agreed. At the outset it is stated that
the determination was reached that the
tripartite government of the group snould
i come to an end and that not more than
two powers â and preferably one- should
govern the islands. it soon developed
! that an agreement was not likely to be
; reached giving the entire group to. one
. power, but the chances seemed good for
an agreement that two powers divide the
islands, thus giving a dual government in
place of the present unwieldy tripartite
arrangement. *-Ââ¢?â¢ â  â¢ â¢--â  â¢ .-- â  -
It seemed to be generally accepted by
: the negotiators, that tl/e -United States
would.be one of the two powers to be
! represented and that the island of Tu
tuilla, on which the harbor of Pago Pago
'â  is located, would naturally fall to the lot
of the United States. It is understood
that the British authorities quite fully
coincided with this view, and while the
Germans seemed to regard it favorably,
it was left open for more mature approval
by the Berlin authorities. In conceding
this island and harbor to the United
States account was taken of the fact that
if an agreement were reached on that
point it would still be for the United
States Senate to give its approval to the
arrangement. One of the remaining isl
ands. Upola. is of much value, while the
other. Savail, is practically valueless. â 
It is suggested that Great Britain cede
the Gilbert and Solomon islands to Ger
many, the latter retiring from Samoa.
The Fiji Islands and some other points
also have been considered during the dis
cussion, but thus far Germany has not
! acted favorably on the suggestion and
! there have been evidences that she pre
-1 fern to retain her interests and make
compensation to Great Britain. This re
mains open and appears to be the chief
point remaining in the way of a final ad
justment.
The foregoing outline was given to-day
in quarters well informed on the general
; lines of the negotiations, although it was
with this reservation, that the under
standings were merely formative and still
open to material change.
JUSTICES REAP
A RICH HARVEST
Hundreds of Suits Filed
in San Jose.
PpÂ»Hnl Dlnpatrh to The Call.
RAN JOSE. Nov. 1.-Thf> failure of the
Tnion Savin*?* Bank Is proving a verita
ble prold mine to the Justices of the Peace
of this city and both courts are loaded
down with complaints In suits brought by
depositors against the stockholders of
that institution.
To-day 1115 suits were filed in Justice
Rosenthal's court. The attorneys in the
cases are Archer 1 & Archer. They repre
sent seventeen plaintiffs, as follows: Anne
Criste. S. R. Johnston, Alexander Fili
pelio, Reta 'Johnston, H. R. .Fisher, Jennie
Johnston, Patrick and Kate Ilanrahan,
P. R. Wells, Lizzie E. Johnston, Mary
.Laederich, Ida B. White, Mark Johnston
Tillie Bodell, S. C. Beau.' Hattie A. Timo
thy. Joseph A. Barker and 11. F. Woeal.
Separate suits are filed against some 150
stockholders for I 'their' prorata liability
to plaintiffs as depositors. Anne. Criste
and five others have each sued â  128 sepa
rate stockholders,' and the other ; plaintiffs
have sued from that 1 number down to a
dozen. The amounts demanded :in the
suits range from 25.cents. to $80.
A summons has been issued , In each
case, and already some of the small stock
holders have settled. .
If Justice Rbsenthal collects the regular
fees prescribed by law in each case over
$5000 will jingle in his pocket, while the
Constables will rake in about $1200 for
serving the summons. As this comes un
der the head of civil business the State
gets none of the fees.- â 
The fees as prescribed by law are $2
when each case has been filed, $2 addi
tional if judgment by default i.Â« entered
and $1 more if a trial is had. This makes
a total of $."> for the Justice in each case.
In case an appeal is taken from the Jus
tice court another $1.50 must be paid.
Constables can collect 50 cents for each
summons served. * .
It Is not likely these fees will be collect
ed, and it Is more than likely that Justice
Rosenthal has agreed to take a stipulated
sum for. the batch of complaints. ..' j
: Archer & Archer still represent some
thirty additional plaintiffs, and in : a few
days will file nearly 3000 more suits.
Justice Wallace's court has been not
the less favored, and hundreds of suits
have been filed there since the bank fail
ure. Â;â .;
The Impression prevails now about town
that a Justice court is better â¢ââ  than a
Klondike claim, and there will be a Brand
rush for the places when the next elec
tion comes around. Besides all civil
business; the Justices get a salary." of $2000
per year.
The Roanoke had on board, according
to her owners, drafts and dust from Cape
Nome amounting to $1,000,000. The prin
cipal portion of this Is represented by
drafts held by John Brynteson, Jafet
Llndeberg, P. S. Anderson and C. W. A.
K.llllman. four of the original locators of
the ramp. There were fully 200 others on
board with dust valued at from $500 to
$15,000 each, a largo portion of the same
being beach dust.
The principal holdings are about as
follows; Llndeberg and Brynteson,
$400,000; J. R. Anderson, $100,000; C. W. A.
Kjillman, $75,000; N. I. K. Hatch. $50,000;
F. Bchow, $.30,000: H. C. Wilkinson, $30,000.
Â«>\\ing to the alleged impurity of the
â water at Nome typhoid fever was quite
p-t.-neral at the time the Roanoke left, and
twelve deaths had occurred. Six of the
patients who were sufficiently veil to
travel came down on the Roanoke In the
big staterooms which were fixed up as a
temporary hospital. Jafet Llndeberg,
one of Cape Nome's richest men, was
among the unfortunates.
James H. Girllnt. a well known Eng
lish mining expert, who went north last
June for the Anglo-Alaskan syndicate,
diod October 22 on board the Roanoke at
Dutch Harbor. Typhoid fever caused his
death. At T'nalaska the body was pre
pared tor burial at the Bessie Lee Home
111111 later interred. He has spent about
twenty years In South Africa, but con
sidered London his home.
FALLING WALLS
CRUSH OUT LIFE
Collapse of a Six-Story
Building.
Sj^ciai Dtapatch to Thp Call.
CHICAGO. Nov. I.â Three men are
known to have perished and three others
are reported missing as the result of the
collapse of a six-story building at 139 and
141 \ â¢ .- â  Lake street this evening. Con
siderable damage was done to adjoining
property, and during the excitement It
was reported that as many as forty lives
had been lost. About $200,000 damage was
done. The dead:
â¢'"-> B. Doctor, barn foreman for the
New Kngland Mills Company, caught In
i U u Pi l of building at time of explosion
ana body recovered by firemen.
l'rankiin S. Hanson, proprietor New
Kngland Mills Company, body removed
by tin men, badly burned.
Henry Hilton, bookkeeper for New Eng
inad Mills Company, body under the
wreckage near where that of his em
ployer was recovered.
'Mi.- missing: Charles Mullens, peddler,
last seen struggling to reach an exit after
the Leonard building had collapsed and
burled in the ruins of the mill; unidenti
fied woman, said to have been caught by
the portion of the Leonard building wail
that tell into the street; C. Williams ad
o' 5 I f \, not known, employe of Leonard
Seed Company.
The cause of the 1 collapse is unknown,
some claiming that there was an explo
sion in the store of S. F. Leonard, dealer
In seeds, others saying that the walls fell
without apparent cause." The generally
accepted theory is that there was an ex
plosion of dust in thy seed store.
The, crash came with less than one min
ute > warning, and Mr. Leonard, who no
ticed the walls of the building shift slight
y, called to his employes to run for their
lives, and without a second's delay they
rushed for the street, the last of them
getting through the doorway Just in time
After reaching the street the women
employes of Leonard rushed into the
home of Mrs. Agnes Whelan, 135 Lake
street. Mrs. Whelan, however, noticed
that the house was in danger and refused
to allow the women to remain. In
less than half a minute the east
wall fell and the house, together with the
adjoining one. was buried beneath the
ruins. Adjoining Mrs. Whelan's house
and next to the seed building stood a two
story frame structure occupied by Kelso
Bros., dealers in paper. A number of
young girls and two men were at work at
the time and a panic followed In their ef
forts to escape. The two men smashed
the windows and in that way rescued the
girls.
The following are the heaviest losses
i sustained: Simeon F. Leonard, wholesale
seeds, loss $100 ,000, Insurance $80,000; C. T.
Bowal, owner of the building, $50,000, in
surance full; New England Mill, E. S.
Hanson, proprietor, $25,000; J. C. Meyer,
pickles and vinegar, $10,000.
MR. HOBART APPEARS
SOMEWHAT STRONGER
Invalid Takes Some Nourishment
and Is Besting More
Quietly.
PATERSON, N. .7.. Nov. I.â Vice Pres
ident Hobart took some nourishment to-
night. Mrs. Hobaii says ho looks better
and stronger than he has appeared in
two or three week*. The prospects ;irf
that he will paaa a better night than he
did last night. He had the newspapers
read to him to-ni^ht, and took quite an
interest in current affairs. He also talked
for a lime about his private business af
fairs.
The doctor left the Hobart residence at
9 o'clock, and It is not likely that he will
return to-night.
Vice President Hobarfs wonderful vital
ity st;:nds him In good stead. He wants
to keep posted on current affairs, and
when he awakens from a sleep he gener
ally asks those near him if there is any
thing new.
All day long crowds of people gathered
in front of the newspaper offices wlu'ie
the bulletins were posted. There was an
other gathering or sympathizing friends
about Carroll Hall, but none except rela
tives were allowed to see the patient.
Dr. \V. K. Newton, spends most of his
time in the Hobart house, and he is now
the only physician in attendance. Emi
nent specialists are directing the treat
ment through Dr. Newton. Those who
have passed on the case are Dr. W. W.
Johnston of Washington, who was called
when Mr. Hobart was first taken ill in
Washington, and who visited him at
Long Branch with Dr. Newton during the
summer months; Mrs. Janeway and Bull
of New York, Professor Osier of Balti
more and Dr. Delafield of Columbia Uni
versity.
â¢ Telegrams and messages of sympathy
have been received, as well as flow
ers, from all parts of the country
Through the trying ordeal Mrs. Hobart
bears up surprisingly well. She remains
with the nurses most of the time in the
sickroom with her husband.

SEATTLE, Nov. I.â The steamer Hum

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, Nov. I.â General Hughes,
commanding in the Visayan district, has
si-nt in an encouraging report. He says
the islaiiu of Negros is now more peaceful
and orderly than for twenty years. The
planters are pursuing their business un
disturbed by the bands of brigands who
had long levied tribute on them. The
Americans have scattered the brigands
and propose to pursue them until they
are effectually suppressed.
General Young's column entered Caba
nautuan. north of San lsidro, yesterday
morning. Colonel Parker, with two tn>"i>s
of the Fourth Cavalry, took possession
of the deserted town of Aliaza.
Captain Batson captured a telegraph
operator and his escort, finding a tele
gram to Aguinaldo from an insurgent
colonel reporting that General Lawtoti
was killed in a recent fight and that his
body had been sent to Manila. The oper
ator said that 600 insurgents were ap
proaching Aliaza from Tarlac. Batson
placed his scouts in ambush awaiting
them. Colonel Hayes, with four troops
of the Fourth Cavalry, charged the towns
of Talvarera and Cobal, dispersing 160
insurgents and pursuing them for three
miles without any loss. The Americans
captured two brass cannon and a i]iian
tity of ammunition, including many
Hotchkiss shells. Captain Batson took a
storehouse and q \ntities of rice, sugar,
corn and forty bull carts.
The steamer I^ebuan of Hongkong, 800
tons, with a prize crew from the United
States gunboat Castine on board, has ar
rived here. She was captured while run
ning the blockade off Zamboanga. She
had unloaded her cargo of merchandise.
All sie-ns show that General Young's
rapid advance is demoralizing the insur
gents northward. Prisoners report them
to be fleeing to the hills. There are many
deserters and sick men and the former
are taking their arms to the Americans.
The cavalry's rapid movements are a
puzzle to the insurgents, who think that
the Americans in striking in so many
places must have overwhelming forces.
Aguinaido is personally conducting the
campaign. He is asking the people for

with recruits, but without success.

Fays: General Frederick Funston, who is
en route home with the mustered-out
Twentieth Regiment, has wired
his T'T-^-i attorneys, Gleed, Ware &

months. Among other things, he accused
the Kansas officer of taking a robe from a
statue of the Virgin In a church at Caloo
can and presenting it to his wife. These
alleged acts of vandalism are said to have
been not only permitted.by General Fun
ston, but he is accused by Mr. Fox of
setting a bad example to the soldiers by
indulKlnc: in them himself. According to
Mr. Fox, it was a common sight to see
soldiers <arrying away from the churches
rich vestments, crucifixes, statues and
altar ornaments.
General Funston is highly Indignant at
the accusation, and says he will prosecute
the matter vigorously. He intends, he
says, to put a stop forever to the malicious
stories put in circulation regarding him.
General Funston says that he not only
refrained from desecrating houses of wor
ship in Manila, but that while colonel of
the Kansas Regiment he issued a posi
tive order prohibiting the looting or mu
tilation of church buildings. He supple
mented thiswith verbal instructions to his
company commanders to see that this
order was rigidly enforced.
Ireland's Statement.
ST. PAULi, Nov. 1. -Archbishop Ireland
appeared somewhat surprised this evening
when he heard that General Funston of
Kansas was reported as about t<> sue him
for libel on account of statements attrib
uted to him in a Chicago interview. He
said he had made no charges against
General Funston. but had in conversation
expressed the opinion that the statements
of the San Francisco paper charging the
general with having taken a priest's robe
from a Philippine church should be denied
by General Funston at once, lest a failure
to deny led to a wrong Impression. The
Archbishop admitted the substantial ac
curacy of the Chicago interview, but was
not willing to admit that he had made
any Ãbelous, statements.
What Funston Desires.
TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. I.â G. S. Gleed.
senior member of the law firm of Gleed,
' Ware & Gleed, stated to-night that his
; firm had received absolutely no Intimation
1 from General Funston of any purport to
â  begin any legal proceedings against Arch
; bishop Irelajid. Mr. Gleed stated fiat he
had simply received a personal telegram
I from General Funston requesting htm to
1 ascertain if Archbishop Ireland had been
j correctly quoted. General Funston at the
same time expressing the opinion that the
statements attributed to the Archbishop
i would be found to be incorrect. Mr. Gleed
added his surmise that General Funston
i desired this information to enable him to
form a reply to the Archbishop in the
event that the alleged interview should
: prove authentic.
HANNA GREETED WITH
HISSES IN SPRINGFIELD
Police Called Upon to Quiet a Dis-
turbance in a Political
Meeting.
SPRINGFIELD, Nov. I.â Senator Mark
A. Hanna was roundly hissed here to
night upon his Initial appearance at the
City Hall. Cariosity haa attracted a big
crowd to a meeting at which Senator
Hanna was the star. No sooner had he
been introduced than a crowd of about 3Â«.H)
men in the gallery began hissing. Hiss
ing and hooting were continued ror some
minun-s, but without any apparent effect
on Senator Hana.
"1 am used to this sort of thing. It
comes from John R. McLean and his
newspaper," said the Senator, when there
was a slight lull in the uproar. At this
the hissing was taken up again and con
tinued for several minutes. Senator
Hanna made another unsuccessful at
tempt to quiet the noise.
"Bvery American likes fair play,* he
said. "Give me a show. A man who will
not give fair play is a coward."
The hissing was taken up with renewed
vigor and continued till several police
men arrived from headquarters in re
sponse to a hurry call sent in by the Re
publican managers of the meeting. Sen
ator Hanna then gave his usual address
on prosperity and expansion. He studi
ously refrained from mentioning the name
of Governor Bushnell, whose home is in
this city, and this caused a constant flow
of interruptions from Bushnell's partisans,
who were present In force. In fact, It is
now believed that the hissing was done
by Bushnell's Republicans rather than by
Democrats.

HUNTINGTON NOW
IN FULL CONTROL
Mrs. Stanford's Railway Holdings
Formally Transferred to the
Speyer Syndicate.
NEW YORK, Nov. 2â The World says:
An important conference was held yes
terday at the office of C. P. Huntington In
the Mills building: between Mrs. Iceland
Stanford, George Crocker. F. H. Hub
bard and Mr. Huntington to complete the
transfer of the Stanford and Crocker in
terests in Southern and Central Pacific to
the Huntington interests, announced sev
eral weeks ago. Mr. Huntington with his
friends thus comes into sole control of the
great continental system.
Mrs. Stanford returned last Saturday on
the Campania with Edward Speyer, the
London representative of Speyer Bros.,
who in turn represent the London bond
holders. George Crocker has decided to
hold his Pacific Improvement Company
stock despite the efforts made by Mr.
Huntington at the conference.
The Sun says: Mr. Huntington denied
a report that the sale of Mrs. Stanford's
stock to the Huntington-Speyer interests
was discussed at to-day's conference.
"The meeting," he said, "related to an
adjustment of the accounts between the
different interests."
The journal and Advertiser to-morrow
says: As the result of an Important con
ference held yesterday at the office of C.
P. Huntington, between the former con

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. The annual
report of the adjutant general of the
army. Brigadier General Corbin, to the
Secretary of War was made public to-day.
General Corbin sums up the military
forces now In the service of the United
States as follows: Regular army, 64,586;
volunteers, 34,574; total, 99,160.
The regular establishment consists of
ten regiments of cavalry, seven of artil
lery and twenty-five of infantry. The
volunteer establishment consists of one
regiment of cavalry, twenty-four of in
fantry and a Porto Rico battalion.
The distribution of these troops up to
October 1 last was as follows: In the
United States, 34,229; Porto Rico, 3363;
Cuba, 11,187; Philippines, 32,315; en route
to the Philippines, 17,099; Alaska, 499; Ha
waiian Islands, 466.
General Corbin adds the following to
this summary:
It Is ordered that by December 1 next all the
Infantry regiments, I'nlted States Volunteers,
shown above as In the United States, will have
Falle.l for the Philippines. These, with the
troops now there, will give a total strength of
2117 officers and 63,608 enlisted men, an aggre
gate of 85.725.
A recapitulation of the casualties in ac
tions and deaths In the regular and vol
unteer armies between May 1, 1898, and
June 30, 1899, contained in the annual re
port of the adjutant general, shows a
grand total of 10,076 men. The easualtv list
alone aggregates 3454, of whom 35 officers
and 4f>S enlisted men were killed and 197
officers and 2764 enlisted men wounded.
The death list, numbering 6619, was made
up of 224 officers and 6395 enlisted men.
Of this total, but 38 officers and 468 en
listed men were killed, the remainder of
the deaths resulting from various causes,
including the following: Wounds, 10 offi
cers and 192 enlisted men; disease, 165 offi
cers and 6344 enlisted men; accident, 6 of
ficers and 209 men; drowning, 3 officers
and 88 men: suicide, 2 officers and 52 men:
and murders and homicide, 52 enlisted
men.
In the regular army the total of casu
altiee In action and deaths amounted to
4156 .md in the volunteer establishment to
5921. In the casualty list th<> regulars had
127 officers and 1656 enlisted men killed
and wounded, and the volunteers. 105 offi
cers and 1366 enlisted men killed and
wounded. In the regular army between
April 30. 1898, and June 30, 1899, 91 enlisted
men were discharged by sentence of gen
eral court-martial, and 2946 enlisted men
deserted. Three officers of the regular
army who were killed also held commis
sions in the volunteer forces, in which
they are included in the foregoing reca
pitulation.
The service of many of the troops after
the terms of their enlistment had expired
causes General Corbin to say In his re
port:
The patriotism of the regulars and volunteers
who had enlisted only for the war with Spain,
by willingly and actively serving after the ex
piration of their terms of service, calls for evi
dence of appreciation on the part of the de
partment. To this end it is respectfully recom
mended that each officer of the several volun
teer regiments and each enllated man who con
tinued In service In the Philippine Islands after
the 2d of March. 1899, until honorably dis
charged, be awarded a suitably Inscribed medal.
During the year there have been 62,175
enlistments and re-enlistments, of which
53,024 were native born and 9151 foreign
born. In point of color 56,154 were white,
6000 colored and 20 Indians.
The following recommendation Is madÂ«
for extra pay for the officers serving in
our new possessions:
The pay of all officers below the grade of
brigadier general should be increased at least
83 1-3 per cent while on duty In Cuba or our
new possessions. Most of these gentlemen have
families that they are unable to have with
them, and, therefore, are compelled to main
sented by Edgar Speyer, a member of the
London house of Speyer Bros., who
reached this city last Saturday on the
steamship Campania, accompanied by
Mrs. Stanford.
The principal subject under discussion
was the transfer of all interests in the
Pacific Improvement Company to the
bankers' syndicate. This company, which
has a purely nominal capital, owned the
San Francisco terminals used by the
Southern Pacitic, the Hotel del Monte in
Southern California and hotel property
and eating stations along the line of the
various roads controlled by the Southern
Pacific Company.
Of the four equal interests in this cor
poration the bankers are now understood
to own the Huntington, Hubbard and
Stanford interests. George Crocker has
refused heretofore to sell, but it is now
believed that he will do so.
The holdings of these individuals and
estates have already been acquired by
Speyer &. Co. for the syndicate.
The final transfer of Mrs. Stanford's
holdings is understood to have taken place
on Tuesday. As Mr. Huntington is a
member- of the present syndicate, he sim
ply deposits his stock as his share in the
The. new certificates of stock will soon
be issued, the new bonds having already
been delivered, including the amount de
posited with the Government to Insure
the payment of the notes given in settle
ment of the debt of the company to the
T'nited States.
Mr. Huntington. who was seen at the
close of the conference, refused to give
any details of the negotiations, simply
stating that an "adjustment of the vari
ous interests formerly In control of the
company was being decided upon and
settled."
tain two establishments. Also, that provis
ion be made that all officers below the grade
of major general who retire by reason of age
or wounds received In action shall do so on
the next trade above the rank held by them
In the regular army on the date of their retire
ment.
Of the criticisms of the staff organiza
tion of the army, ( General Corbin says:
Mui'h has been written of late concerning a
better staff system. < >urs may be, and doubt
l-'ss is, open to Improvements, but It should be
borne In mln.i that the present organization is
the result of years of legislation borne of the
best thoupht anil labor of our best military
men and has stood successfully the test of all
our wars. The criticisms of our system are
too often the result of disappointment. Seldom
has there one appeared in print whose author
has not been a long-standing applicant for a
place in one of the staff corps or departments.
Th<Â» suggestion that our staff officers are not
experienced in the duties of line officer! is not
borne out by facts.
The report dwells on the courtesies
shown our troops by the British Govern
ment officials while stopping at Gibraltar
and elsewhere en route to the Philippines,
and says this international courtesy will
long live in the memories of both parties
to the spontaneous exchange. The report
speaks of the unsatisfactory conditions
in Hawaii in relation to land for military
uses', saying:
Sales of Government lands and leases of
Crown lands have continued to the present time
and there is very little of either class left In
immediate control of the Government. Should
this action be permitted to continue it will re
sult in embarrassment to the "United States.
It Is urged, therefore, that certain tracts be
taken without delay from the control of the
Hawaiian Government and secured to the fu
ture uses of the United States, or have them
declared as reservations for military purposes.
Recommendation is made that military
officers serving abroad as military at
taches be given increased rank and pay.
As the increased army calls for an ad
ditional number of military academy ca
dets to fill vacancies it is recommended
that the President be authorized to ap
point ten annually and that two be ap
pointed at large from each State. '_ â¦
Satisfaction is expressed that the army
canteen embarrassment has been removed
from the War Department by the action
of Congress in establishing certain re
strictions. Recommendation Is made that
non-commissioned officers be given ad
ditional pay in order to attract to these
places a worthy class, willing to stay in
those grades, and that twenty-five years'
service as an enlisted man shall be suf
ficient to admit to the retired list of en
listed men.
The condition of the artillery service,
especially of the sea coast, the report de
scribes as not altogether satisfactory. It
is believed that the time has arrived
when the artillery branch of the service
should be reorganized and the field ar
tillery separated from that engaged in
the coast defense.
It is recommended that the regimental
organization of the artillery be abolished
and that a corps of field artillery and
one of sea coast artillery be provided
for, separate and distinct from each
other.
In a resume General Corbln says:
The regular army Is now practically at a
maximum, as are also the volunteer regiments.
The -work incident to all these changes'
brought about by the acts aforesaid, involving
the enlistment of 238,500 volunteers; the in
crease of the regular army from 26,000 to 62 -
000; its subsequent reduction, and then again
its increase to 65,000, necessitating numerous
orders and instructions bearing on the same
to say nothing of the complete military record
Of every officer and man of this large forceâ
the magnitude of this work cannot be under
stood until undertaken. That this work has
been done with accuracy and intelligence is
now history. All credit is due to the assistants
and the clerical force of the office
The report also calls attention to the
fact that not a single life has been lost
by accident incident to travel In the
course of all the transportation to the
Philippines.
In conclusion General Corbin points out
an omission of the law in failing to pro
vide chaplains for the volunteer regi
ments, and recommends that, chaplains
be provided for as soon as possible as
the presence of one with each regiment
is deemed very necessary.

ELECTRIC POWER PLANT
DESTROYED BY FIRE
Big Iron Building Completely Ruined
and Employes Barely Escape
With Their Lives.
MOKELUMXE HILT,, Nov. I.â Tne
power plant of the Standard Electric Com
pany, half a mile above Big Bar bridge,
on the Mokelumne River, was totally de
stroyed by fire at an early hour this
morning. The entire corrugated iron and
steel framed and steel trussed building
was gutted. The men on watch barely
escaped with their lives.
The fire started at 5:10 this morning and
In a twinkling the interior of the large
power-house was ablaze. The building 1
was 120 feet long by 60 feet wide and was
supposed to be absolutely fireproof, noth
ing but Bteel, iron and cement having
been used in' its construction. It was one
of the best equipped power-houses in the
country, containing three Pelton water
wheels of 700 horsepower each, three dy
namos of 800 horsepower each, full effi
ciency, and nine transformers, of which
six were in use at the time the fire oc
curred. These transformers carried eigh
teen barrels of petroleum each, and to
cool the fluid were constantly sprayed
with cold water. Because of the liability
to overheating these transformers are al
ways considered dangerous and are usu
ally placed outside of the main power
houses. It is said that this is the only
power plant in the State in which the
transformers are located within the main
powerrhouse.
Superintendent Heinrichs declined to
state what in his judgment caused the
fire or to make an estimate of the loss.
He said he had received instructions from
the headquarters of the company not to
give out any facts whatever. The best
obtainable figures place the loss at $250,
--000. It is impossible to ascertain here if
there was any Insurance on the plant.
There is no doubt that one of the trans
MARCONI HANDICAPPED BY
INCOMPLETE INSTRUMENTS
But He Shows the Government the
Practical Value of the System
in the Navy.
NEW YORK. Nov. I.â The cruiser New
York, flagship of Rear Admiral Farquhar.
and the battleship Massachusetts returned
to-night to the anchorage off Fifty-eighth
street. North River, after being employed
for three days in evolutions for the pur
pose of demonstrating the working of the
Marconi system of wireless telegraphy
under various practical conditions. The
operations were under the direction of a
boarfl of three naval officers, namely:
Lieutenant Commander J. T. Newton,
aboard the New York; Lieutenant J. W.
Bllsh, with the instruments at Navesink,
N. J., and Lieutenant F. K. Hill, aboard
the Massachusetts.
Mr. Marconi was handicapped by in
complete instruments, which had been
brought to the United States simply for
the purpose of reporting the international
yacht races, and was unable to give the
Government board as thorough a demon
stration of the capabilities of the appara
tus as he would have wished. But the
result of the workings of the three sets
of instruments employed in the tests was
to show the Government board that there
Is a practical utility in the system which
wo'.ild be of inestimable value to the
naval vessels during evolutions of any
klnd, and especially when on scouting
duty.
The members of the Government board
will be obliged to call attention to the
fact that during these tests it was
possible for an instrument located with
in the circumscribed radius of transmis
sion to destroy the effectiveness of other
instruments at any time. When the
Massachusetts, for instance, was tele
graphing to the New York the operator
at Navesink sent a message at the same
time, and the result on the receiving side
of the New York's set was a mass of un
readable characters caused by the two
series of electrical impulses reaching the
instrument at the same time.
This was done deliberately. Mr. Mar
coni said that he could prevent this inter
ference on the part of a third station, but
that he would not demonstrate it during
these tests, because he had not yet re
ceived his patents for that feature.
RUSSIAN RAILROAD TO

French Capitalists Supplying Money

BERLIN. Nov. I.â The Tageblatt has

formers became overheated, possibly by
neglect of the watch on duty, and ignited
the oil, whence it was carried from tank
to tank, the dynamos adding fuel to the
flames. Those who witnessed the fire *ay
that It seemed as if a bolt of lightning
had fallen upon the building, and .n
--stantly it was one sheet of flame. The
men on watch did not have time to turn
off the water and stop the machinery and
portions of the plant not destroyed ran up
to noon to-day.
The electric display following the explo
sion of the petroleum tanks was simply
magnificent, the pale blue flames of the
snakellke wires showing luridly through
the dark, dense coal oil smoke. The line
was burned out for quite a distance about
the plant, the big glass insulators drop
ping one by one as the current reached
them. The heat, danger from explosions
and fear of live wires prevented all efforts
at saving the building. The intensity of
the heat is shown in the warped and
twisted iron and steel supports and
trusses, hopelessly entwined with copper
wires, sections of dynamos and trans
formers in sections forming a trellis work
that will never again be molested.
The only thing worth saving in the
building in the water. wheels, which were
under a fall of 1043 feet of 750 inches of
water, which generated 2400 horsepower
and which kept the wildly running wheels
cool after the fire relieved them of belt
ing and governors.
The entire southern mines region is in
darkness to-night and oil lamps and tal

Standard Company is negotiating for
power from the recently completed Utica
plant near Murphys and the natural gas
plant at Stockton, and promises to fur
nish light by Tuesday next. Prince Ponl
atowski is expected here to-morrow. The
old plant will not be rebuilt, as the site of
the new plant has been located four miles
up the river, where it will have 15,000
inches of water, with 400 feet additional
fall.
RODDEN MAKES A
PECULIAR RULING
Imposes a Light Fine to Prevent a
Test of the Game Laws of
Marin.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. I.â A few days ago
George Houtallin, a local laundryman,
was arrested by order of Game Warden
Robertson for killing an oriole near Fair
fax. J. J. Murray was retained as coun
sel, and declared that he could easily
prove the game laws unconstitutional on
the ground that they not only were filled
with intrinsic absurdities, but conflicted
with the State laws.
While Murray was absent from town
Houtallin was taken before Justice Rod
den and induced to change his plea from
not guilty to guilty, in consideration of
which he was fined the costs of court,
amounting to $7 30. This was really done
in order to prevent the game laws from
being tested.
To-day Murray accosted Rodden and
demanded to know why it was that if
the man were fined at all he was fined
less than the provision of the ordinance
allowed, the minimum fine being $20.
Rodden replied that he had suspended
sentence in Houtallin's case.
"This is the rawest work I ever heard
| of," declared Murray. "If the man was
j fined at all the minimum penalty should
j have been imposed, and if sentence were
suspended nobody had a right to fine him
anything."
TRIAL POSTPONED.
Defendants in the Fuller Will <7ase
in Court.
CHICO, Nov. I.â To-day at 10 o'clock a.
m. was the time set for the arraignment
of the forgery and perjury charges in the
Fuller will case, in which J. Ellis Roilnny,
:J. M. Garr.er and Minnie Housewonn
stand charged with the grave offense.
The courtroom was crowded long before
the arrival of the hour, so great was the
interest taken In the matter. When the
hour arrived William H. Schooler, attor
ney for Dr. Rodney, asked the court
for an extension of time for his
client to make his plea and the same
was granted until November 13. Mrs.
Houseworth was given the same period.
The spectators were anxious for the time
to arrive when J. M. Garner would enter
his plea. Garner was not represented by
counsel and to the charge of perjury he
pleaded guilty and to the forgery not
guilty. December 4 is the time set for
passing sentence, and his bondsmen hav
ing withdrawn, he was remanded to the
custody of the Sheriff. Garn?r has turned
State's evidence, having confessed to
drawing the forged will, and great is tha
speculation in the length of time whic.i
he will receive. Mrs. Rodley appeared in
court with her husband. She is endeavor
ing to obtain bonds for him and is willing
to do all in her power to aid the doctor.

Jimmy Wakely, former backer of John
Ia Sullivan, is a stanch admirer of the
Callfornian Hercules. He thinks that
Jeffries will win Inside of ten rounds. To
show iiis confidence in the Callfornlan's
pugilistic ability ho made the following
wagers to-night: $K"kki to $Soi with John
Byrnes: $800 to $400 with "Ixirry" Clem*

"Markle" Mayer is a stronp admirer of
the champion. He bet George Considine
$1000 to $SOO that Jeffries would win. Con
si'line made two other bets of $4'Hi against
$TiOo on Sharkey. He bet with business men
who did not wish their names published.
Tom O'Rourke, Shark^y's manager,

GOSSIP AND
NOTES FROM
THE DIAMOND
Sacramento's Team Will Win
the Championship in the
League Race.
Four weeks more and the league games
will come to an end. Unless something
phenomenal happens Sacramento will win
the championship and the pennant, for
that team has' a comfortable lead. The
turn came last week, when Sacramento
won the Saturday game from Oakland
and was given the Sunday game because
Oakland childishly objected to a decision
of the umpire and refused to continue the
game unless it was changed.
This double loss to Oakland set the
Dudes back, and they are in their old
position at the tail end of the column.
The time is not so short, however, that
Oakland may not work its way up a peg
and finish third in the race. The only
struggle for a position will be between
Santa Cruz and Oakland for third place,
as only 8 per cent separates them at
present. The standing of the teams is as
follows:
After the season is completed there will
probably be a month of ball games be
tween a team formed from Californians
who have played in the East this year
and who are now in California and the
champions. No definite team has been
picked, but the following players would
make a good Eastern combination: Chance
of Chicago, catcher: Hughes of Baltimore
and Knell of Hartford, pitchers. Lange
(Chicago i, first base; Reitz. second base;
Lockhead (Cleveland), shortstop; Hulen
(Kansas City), third base; McHale (Wash
ington), Mertes (Chicago) and Van Hal
tren (New York), fielders.
An Interesting suit was tried yesterday
afternoon, in which Danny Long and
and Chance figured as principals. Long
shim] Chance for S2sf> on an agreement that
the sum was promised the former by the
latter if Chance was given a position on
the Chicago team. Harris was called in
as a witness and testified that he was
instrumental in securing the position for
Chance.
On Saturday next and Sunday Oakland
and Sacramento will meet in this city
for the afternoon games, and in Oakland
Sunday morning. Sacramento and Santa
Crux will cross bats in Vallejo, the Lob
sters playing a local batter;,. A large
crowd is expected from the adjacent
towns. The games nt Vallejo will be
played Sunday morning and afternoon.
Smith, who, by the way, will officiate as
Jeffries' timekeeper at the contest, ha.s
bet $1000 against $800 on the Californian, I.
T. Henry taking the Sharkey end. Dick
Kane announced t"-night he had $3500 to
bet against U 00 that Sharkey would win.
Hundreds of small wagers were recorded.
Both Sharkey and Jeffries took their
final exercise at their respective training
charters to-day. Jeffries' work at Allen
hurst consisted of sparring:, wrestling and
a game of handball. At the conclusion of
his day's work he said that he never felt"
better in bis life and was never so confi
dent of victory. He says he Is in much
better condition than when he fought
Fitzsimmon.s, and remarked:
"Having beaten Sharkey once, why
shouldn't I do it ;;pain?"
It leaked out at Allenhurst to-day that
had Sharkey not agreed to a postpone
ment of the battle and claimed Jeffries'
forfllt money of $1000 the California!)
would have insisted upon a new set of
articles being drawn and a clause inserted
to the effect that the winner take all. It
is said that somebody told Sharkey of it
and he agreed to the postponement with
out, claiming the forfeit money. This
story was told by Jeffries' trainers as
showing the big fellow's confidence in his
ability to take the sailor's measure.
Jettries will break up his training camp
to-morrow. He will do no work at all,
simply "loaf" around until he starts for
this city on the 2 o'clock train. He will
be accompanied by Tommy Ryan, Ernest
Roeber, Billy Delaney and Jack Jeffries.
On his arrival In town he will immedi
ately repair to the Vanderbilt Hotel, re
maining there until 8 o'clocn.. when he
will visit tne Broadway Athletic Club to
see the twenty-five round bout between
George Dixon of Boston- and Will Cur
ley "f England. He will spend the night
at the Vanderbilt Hotel and leave early
Friday morning for Coney Island.
Sharkey also got in good practice licks
at his training quarters at Newdorp to
day. His exercise, which was of a very
vigorous character, comprised bag punch
ing, boxing, wrestling, handball and work
on the wrist machine. The sailor is a
thoroughly trained athlete and said to
some friends to-day that physically he
never felt better in his life. Up reiterated
his prediction of a few days ago that he
would win inside of fifteen rounds.
Tom will take things very easy to-mor
row, his programme for the day provid
ing for light work on the wrist' machine
and a short walk. He will leave his train
ing quarters at fi o'clock and will be ac
companied by George Dixon, whom he

F. A. McComb's white and black prey

Union Coursing Park yesterday, defeating
J. H. Perigo's Controller in the all-impor
tant final. Controller seemed to have an
excellent chance in the final, as in the
third and fourth rounds ho had easy
"byes," one accidental, the other natural.
He led to the hare by four lengths

strong one and Motto outstayed and out

caped. The score was 10 points to 5.
Motto met Morning Glory in the first
round and the hare proving a short one,

ALL the signs point to the election
of Horace Davis. The clean can
vass conducted by the Republican
party wins the approval of the peo
ple. The Republican nominee for
Mayor is a man of fine Intellect, high
character and decent associates. It can
be truly said of him that he does not
lead a double life. I
The convention which nominated Hor
ace Davis proceeded from the people
through the rations of the Stratum
primary law. The delegates to the con
rentlon were not boss-ridden. There was
no boss behind the scenes directing the
lolegates to nominate this man or that
man. The Republican ticket, therefore,
.s representative of the best citizenship
Df San Francisco.
The Democratic municipal convention
it-as programmed from the outset. Phe
an, Rainey and Mi Nab selected the nom
inees long before the delegates balloted.
Dn September 15, three weeks before the
aominations were made, The Call pub
ished the Democratic ticket. The Phelan
ilate was broken at one stage of the pro
ceedings when Haley was nominated for
County Clerk, but Boss Phelan, who waÃ
5.- hind the scenes, personally directing af
,'airs, ordered that the result should not
Â£>c announced. The broken forces of the
Â»oss were anally rallied and whipped Into
line. "When order was restored Phelan
remanded that Dennis Geary should be
sinced on the ticket for County Clerk and
;he -ridden convention obeyed the
âºommand. Now Phelan has Geary on his
lands, and the Democrats wish him Joy
it his new possession.
Democrats who have carried the banner
Â»f Democracy in many a hard-fought
jampalgn for the maintenance of Jeffer
mnian principles are not lending their
lupport to the Phelan<-Rainey municinal

SHALL SCHOOL TEACHERS OF SAN FRANCISCO APPLY HERE
RECENT disclosures should convince every intelligent citizen of San Francisco that Boss Rainey is the secret political agent of Phelan
in this campaign. Under the administration of Mayor Phelan Rniney has enjoyed special privileges and consideration. He main
tains a firm grasp on the Fire Department with Phelan's knowledge and acquiescence. Men who study politics beneath the sur
face reach the intelligent conclusion that Rainey is reaching out for enlarged powers. It would not be surprising if the existing secret bar
gain stipulated that Rainey should annex School Department patronages to his Fire Department privileges.
School teachers and the parents of school children may contemplate the spectacle of Boss Rainey indorsing and rejecting applications
for positions in the Department of Education. In days gone by, under Democratic administration of municipal affairs, the source of au
thority in the School Department was established in a Bush street saloon. If history does not repeat itself it may come so close to repe
tition that School Department headquarters will be fixed at the St. George stables on Bush street.
party, while others prefer to remain silent i
and passive.
The demoralization of the Phelan- i
Rainey column is obvious. At the begin- j
ning of the campaign leaders on both
sides favored a clean contest. The cam- ;
paign had not proceeded far on these lines i
when Phelan and Rainey saw that they
were losing ground. The great audiences ]
which assembled to hear and cheer Hor- |
ace Davis and listen to the intelligent ut- i
terances of other Republican speakers I
alarmed Phelan and Rainey. In order to
check the Republican advance Rainey
rt..mmended a return to sewer rat poll
tics, hence the Examiner and Bulletin
witre Instructed to revile and caricature
Horace Davis and cast upon his honored |
name every manner of foul aspersions.
The purpose in the change of tactics was
to throw dust in the eyes of the people
and divert their attention from the real
issues of the campaign. The plan did not
succeed. Since the Democratic change of
base the Republican meetings have been
larger and more inspiring to the people
than ever. Horace Davis is gaining
strength every hour.
The Republican merchants who sup- j
ported Phelan in 1896 and IS9B are now
heart and soul for Horace Davis. They
reason Intelligently that a Democratic
Victory In San Francisco at this election]
would be accepted throughout the country I
as a slap in the face of the Republican j
national administration.
Phelan in the role . of tyrant has pro
claimed a boycott on all Republicans who
have the sense and courage to consider
national questions in the local campaign.
It Is essential to the merchant, the me
chanic and the laborer at all work that

under Republican auspices, shall be pro

test Phelan declares that bo will, if re
elected Mayor, exclude from the governing
commissions to be appointed under the
new charter all Republicans who sock to
introduce national politics into the local
campaign.
His Imperial Highness James D.
Phelan therefore appoints himself kei per
of the conscience and intelligence of Re
publicans. If he can arrogate to himself
the right to tell people what political ;
sentiments they shall introduce at certain I
seasons of the year, and what shall not '
be considered, ne may soon In his ar- j
romance assume to tell people what they I

they shall worship and whom they shau I
praise. In addressing the Montio.ello Club I

the people forget that he proclaimed i.ie

The Republicans in every district of the
city are displaying remarkable activity
The candid, honest utterances of II

welcome which the workingmen extend

magnitude of Horace Davis' vote south
of Market street and along the water

The taxpayers of the city are sizing up
Phelan. They may be fooled once or
twice, but to fool them a third time re
quires more ingenuity than the Mayor
possesses. The plain figures presented to
the people demonstrate that the salary

alarming proportions since Phelan"s first
election to the office of Mayor in 1896. It
is the Mayor's duty under the law to
guard against extravagance, robbery and
jobbery, but Phelan allowed one Board of
Education to outrageously plunder the
revenues of the School Department. The
sum of $1,000,000 scarcely represents the
increased cost of city government under
Phelan's administration of municipal af
fairs. Phelan's knowledge of business af
fairs is limited. He knows how to collect
rent and evict a delinquent tenant, but his
business sagacity hardly extends beyond
that degree.

COLORED CITIZENS
FOR HORACE DAVIS
An enthusiastic meeting of the colored
citizens of the city and county of San
Francisco was held last night in Califor
nia Hall, 620 Bush street, for the purpose
of indorsing the candidacy of Horace
Davis for Mayor and of the other aspi
rants for positions on the Republican
ticket.
At x o'clock the hall was crowded. The
meeting was called to order by S. M.
Davison, who stated in a few words the
principal issues of the campaign and the
necessity of placing Republican candi
dates in office. He then introduced the
speakers of the evening, including Horace
Davis, Major Kyle. Major Boxton, L. A.
Gibbons, John Lackmann, C. H. Jackson
and other candidates. Mr. Davis was re
ceived with cheers, which continued to
punctuate his address.
Before adjourning resolutions, signed by
hundreds of colored voters, were passed
and adopted, pledging firm support to
Republican candidates and principles.

election of Mr. Davis will tend to the maintenance
of these industrial conditions which both desire it is
not a friendly act in Mr. Lane, no matter in what

class appeals to workingmen for the support of can
didates who have never been laborers nor em
ployers. v s
THE BRITISH REVERSE.
THE strained attention of the world is fixed upon
South Africa. The nations have grown accus
tomed to England's triumphant march of em
pire. Since her loss of the American colonies she has
had no serious reverse. Her policy was mapped out
by that British statesman who cried out: "The road
Ito greatness is in getting land. Get land! Get land!
| And never surrender a single grain of sand."'
In pursuance of that policy she has been getting
' land in every zone, and frequently with disregard of
the rights of its owners and its sovereignty. But the
â  shadow on her path amply justifies the statesmanship
of I'.laine, who said land should not be acquired by
! force when it carried an indignant and hostile popu
-1 lation. Where Enpland has been able to displace an
| aboriginal race by planting her own people, under
1 physical conditions that permit their perpetuation
; from generation to generation, her policy has
| strengthened rather than weakened her. In Canada,
! New Zealand and Australia she has the moral and
I physical support of people of her own race and
blood, who enjoy the benefit of her institutions. But
in tropical India and throughout her conquests in the
torrid zone she rules a sullen population, indignant
and hostile, under a vertical sun that bars out her
own blood. j
Her present attempt is in reality to end duality of
sovereignty in South Africa and make a right of way
for a Cairo to Cape railroad on ground under British
control.
In its execution she must wipe out the two Dutch
republics. Their people are in arms fighting for their
; independence and their homes. If they are overcome
| and their self-government is destroyed the survivors
will constitute that indignant and hostile population
: described by Mr. Blame.
So far the South African republicans have the ad
< vantage in the fighting. They have the enduring ad
j vantage that is always with men who are defending
i their homes against invasion. The United States is
' beginning to realize what this advantage is, though
we are fighting a weak and poorly equipped people.
Spain defended her conquests against us only ii.Â«
days. The Filipinos have withstood us more than
twice that time, and the end is not yet.
It is easy to foresee the exceeding danger of Eng
land's position. The news of her reverses rings
around the world. In hither and farther India and
Ceylon the alien races she has subjected by force be
gin to feel the sap of manhood surge under the skin.
If her situation in South Africa does not improve her
Eastern empire may be in revolt from the Chitral
to Mandalay. Glcncoe and Ladysmith may be to
her what the Teiitohcrererwald was to Rome in the
time of Augustus, and the modern world may receive
a lesson in the weakness of universal empire that
will inspire men to accept as true that the meek will
inherit the earth, not the strong. .
The disasters which have so far attended her cam
paign against the Boers are dreadful when viewed
from the standpoint of her prestige. They are piti
ful when considered from a human point of view.
The Boers are utterly isolated, in an international
sense. The great powers are crazed with the new
doctrine that a few strong nations have the right to
divide the planet between them. In the greed-gotten
judgment of those who govern, a weak people, free
souled but few. have no right-; deserving the respect
of the strong. So from no capita] of any country
except Holland has gone an expression of sympathy
under the seal of power and authority. The Boers
have only the sky above them and underfoot the
land they pioneered whereon their homes are built.
They have gone out against Goliath of Gath, and
their ammunition is from the brook Kedron. Among
the people of the nations runs a thrill responsive to
their courage and in applause of their victories, but
that is all.
England, with her thousand battleships, and her
prestige and the support of the commercial spirit in
the United State-, holds the nations at bay. On her
side the reverses of her arms are pitiful, too. The
be>t she breeds, the dower of her gentry and
yeomanry, have gone against the republics as the
legions of Yarns went against Hermann. We are
sorry for the errand on which they were ordered and
lament their dead, fallen in such a cause. American
feeling rises to the throat at the spectacle of grjm old
Joubert soothing the pillow of General Symons,
closing his dazed ryes, and then from the scene of
battle sending his sorrow and condolence to the
agonized widow in far England.
Perhaps the best one can wish now is that the
Boer victories be so closely followed by others as to
compel England to listen to requests for mediation
rather than that she should enter upon a war of
extermination, exhaustive of her resources and peril
ous to her empire.
The widow of the late Police Judge Campbell
claim 1 ; that she is being persecuted by a Portuguese
named Toe Fenera. who wants to marry her. whether
or no. He claims that he is under the influence of
spirits that desire him to marry the lady. Fenera
probably means "booze," not "spirits."
THE APPROACHING ELECTIONS.
SIX States of the Unionâ Massachusetts, Mary
land, Mississippi, lowa. Kentucky and Ohio
are to elect State officers this fall, but only in
Maryland, Kentucky and Ohio are the contests
widely interesting. It is assured that lowa and Mas
sachusetts will go Republican and that Mississippi
will give as large a Democratic majority as the peo
ple think necessary. The votes in those States,
therefore, will count for little in estimating the drift
of public sentiment on any of the issues of the day,
and but a slight degree of attention will be paid to
'.hem.
In the other three States there are big questions in
volved and the campaigns have been waged aggres
sively on both sides. In Maryland Gorman is fight
ing for a chance to return to political power with
something of his former prestige. Divisions in the
councils of the Republican party in the State give
him reason for believing he will be successful; but,
on the other hand, the gold Democrats have taken
up the fight for the Republican party on the ground
that Democratic success in the election would be a
victory for Bryar.ism and. make it difficult to carry
Maryland for sound money in the Presidential con
test of next year, and their votes may counterbalance
Republican disaffection.
The fight in Kentucky is mainly one for honest
politics against boss rule and the corrupt forces that
brought about the nomination of Goebel. In a
certain sense Bryanism is also at stake in that State,
for Bryan has been one of the most active supporters
of Goebel. The campaign at the outset threatened
to be one of pistols and bowie knives as well as of
tongue and pamphlets, for there was no limit set on
either side to personal denunciations of opposing
candidates and orators.
Goebel himself has been denounced with all the
brimstone strength and picturesque variety of Ken
tucky eloquence when most inspired by animosity,
genius and whisky- By common consentj however,
THE SAN FHAU CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 2. 1899.
it seems to have been agreed that a stump speech is
a privileged communication and there have been
neither duels nor libel suits to mar or interfere with
the free flow of oratory. There are four tickets in
the field, and as the chances are the honest Demo
crats and the Populists will draw their strength from
the regular Democracy headed by Goebel, there is a
good prospect for a sweeping Republican victory,
provided a fair count can be obtained.
It is in Ohio that the political interest of the year
mainly centers. The outlook for Republican success
is bright, and yet victory is by no means certain.
Not only, has McLean made a vigorous canvass, but
there are bitter faction fights in the Republican ranks,
and. moreover, the candidacy of Mayor Jones of
Toledo, who is running on a non-partisan ticket, is
liable to weaken the Republican vote in some quar
ters. The chief significance of the contest is that a
victory for either Jones or McLean would be claimed
as a defeat of the administration. The issues of the
campaign have been almost wholly national, not
withstanding the fact that McLean has tried to dodge
the money plank of the platform and has sought to
win votes by attacking trusts and imperialism.
The only other State in whose election there is
much outside interest is Nebraska, where Bryan is
making a personal fight for the maintenance of his
prestige. He has entered upon an elaborate canvass,
county by county, and should the Republicans carry
the State it would be a proof that even in his own
home the free silver agitator has lost influence and
leadership. There is a good prospect of his defeat.
The prosperity brought about by the Republican
policies of protection and sound money has been felt
in Nebraska as well as elsewhere, and it is likely the
common sense of the voters will prompt them to
cast their ballots for the party of good times rather
than for that of calamity.
Reports from the South African battlefields have
all the delightful interest of misinformation. The
military authorities at London are evidently manipu
lating paper armies while the Boers are making
vacancies in the roll of British officers on the field.
DUTY OF REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS.
SINCE it seems settled beyond all questioning
that Gage will call an extra session of the
Legislature to promote the railroad scheme for
sending Burns to the United States Senate, and since
it appears impossible for the indignation of the peo
ple to prevent the plan from being carried out, there
remains but one safe course for Republicans to pur
sue â those of them who at the last session baffled the
schemes of the Kentucky corporation must now unite
upon some candidate and by electing him achieve a
complete victory.
At the last session it was found to be impossible
to organize into a compact and united body the full
strength of Republican opposition to the railroad.
Many of the members were pledged to one or more
of the various candidates who represented genuine
Republicanism, and a sense of loyalty prevented
them from leaving their own leader to take up the
cause of another. At the coming session a different
course should be pursued. It is plain to the under
standing of any intelligent man that unless all the
strength of true Republicanism be exerted the tre
mendous combination which can and will be exerted
by Gage and Herrin and the other corrupt forces
back of Burns will either win a triumph for him or
else prevent the election of a Senator.
The rank and file of stanch Republicans through
out the State are not committed to any particular
candidate for the Senate. They ask only that the
Republicans in the Legislature get together and elect
<t Republican of sterling honesty, known ability and
well attested public spirit and patriotism. The party
is not lacking in men worthy of Senatorial honors,
and it ought to be a comparatively eas)- task for Re
publican legislators to agree upon such a man in
opposition to the adventurer whom the railroad has
put up as "Herrin's candidate."
To bring about the harmony which will assure the
co-operation of all good Republicans in the Legisla
ture is the duty of the hour so far as State politics
are concerned, and steps should be taken toward its
accomplishment at once. The railroad, the Governor
and the other leaders and touts of the Burns forces
have been active for some time. In fact, they have
been working more or less energetically ever since the
close of the last session. Their faction in the Legis
lature will be as strong as organization can make it
and will be directed with as much skill as the astute
wire-pullers at the head of it can exercise. A com
bination of that kind cannot be beaten by a divided
party. Sooner or later a Senator to fill the vacancy
from this State must be filled, and if the rep
resentatives of true Republicanism cannot agree upon
a candidate and elect him, then the railroad gang
will.
A divided party, no matter how excellent be the
men who compose it, can never defeat a thoroughly
organized and disciplined faction, no matter how
vicious the faction may be. A certain number of
votes are required to elect a United States Senator.
If honest Republicans unite they will have the votes
needed for victory. If they remain divided they can
elect no one, and in the end some of the weaker mem
bers will go over to the railroad and elect the candi
date of the corporation.
Davitt's determination to resign his seat in Parlia
ment by way of protest against the war waged for
the overthrow of the Transvaal has not been received
with much favor by other Irish members. Redmond
is reported to have called it a "play to the galleries,"
and there seems no inclination to imitate the per
formance.
About the only good reason the Phelanites can
give for objecting to Republican references to national
issues in the present campaign is that they have no
record of their own on national issues they are will
ing to talk about.
It is reported that up to date the British Intelli
gence Department has had no difficulty in keeping
informed of the plans of the Boers. If General Jou
bert would only disguise them as jokes no English
man would be able to unravel them.
Cupid has won another victory. Judge Seawell
has decided that the marriage of a school teacher is
not in the meaning or law or sense an offense suffi
cient to deprive any of the fair sex of the means of
livelihood.
The vehemence with which two Oakland ministers
are scoring each other is something more than a
mild intimation that the spirit of peace is still hover
ing out of reach.
Latest reports from South Africa indicate that
Lord Wolseley's doctored reports of battles have
not interfered very seriously with the aim of Boer
sharpshooters.
A great brass trust has been organized in the East.
Most of the local Democratic candidates are eligible

cations.
VOICE OF THE PRESS.
HAVE VOTES BEEN BOUGHT TO ELECT BUBNS?
TVinnemucca Silver State.
It Is reported on good authority that Governor Gage of California is going
to call a special session of the Legislature in order to elect a United State Sena
tor. The Southern Pacific Company must be getting uneasy when it goes to the
length of ordering its puppet to throw the burden of an extra session on Cali
fornia. Perhaps "Uncle" fears that the appointment of Burns will not be sanc
tioned by the United States Senate and he will make another try to elect him by
the Legislature. Plenty of time has elapsed since the Legislature adjourned in
which to buy up enough members to make the election of Burns a certainty.
THE CALL AS AN EDUCATOR.
CAMPBELL VISITOR.
The San Francisco Call is initiating on this coast the plan of home education
through the columns of a daily newspaper. This is making the daily an edu
cator In a very literal sense. The course is as follpws: Mondays and Thursdays,
Studies in Shakespeare; Tuesdays, The World's Great Artists; Wednesdays, Desk
Studies for Girls, Shop and Trade Studies for Boys; Fridays, Great American
Statesmen; Saturdays, Home Science. A booklet with full particulars will be
mailed on application to manager Home Study Circle, San Francisco Call.
PACIFIC CABLE MAY BE UNNECESSARY.
SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS.
The Marconi system of wireless telegraphy, 'which has been so successfully
employed in connection with the yacht races at New York, is to be used in the
Hawaiian and Philippine islands, where there is great need of that or some other
system of telegraphic communication, and it may be so developed as to render
unnecessary the laying of a cable across the Pacific Ocean. It will be remem
bered that at first the telephone was confined to very short circuits, while now It
connects widely distant points.
AN EXAMINER LIE NAILED.
Eureka Standard.
The highest tribute yet paid to Signor Marconi, who has demonstrated the
success of his wireless telegraph system by reporting the yacht races by it,
came from Thomas Edison, who said: "He succeeded where I failed." Yet the
yellow Examiner lied to Its readers when it attempted to make them believe
that The Call's reports of the races, secured by the wireless telegraph, were
faked.
SHOULD MEET THE POPULAR DEMAND.
Monitor.
The Call reminds the Associated Press that what this country wants from
the Transvaal is news and not editorial comment with a strong British bias.
The Associated Press can hardly be expected to meet this demand. It appears
to be an intensely pro-British concern.
THE EXAMINER A POOR GUESSER.
Winnemucca Silver State.
The Examiner's experts, which have been predicting the defeat of the Co
lumbia all along, are having a hard time explaining how the American boat
happened to win. The Examiner's judgment on sporting events does not seem
to be of the best.
BULLETIN'S REPUTATION GONE.
UKIAH REPUBLICAN PRESS.
The San Francisco Bulletin, which from a Republican newspaper has devel
oped* into a rabid organ of the Democratic push, has lostwhat little reputation it
once possessed. Its contemporaries are now accusing it of having been bought
by Dictator Phe!r\n. â¢

A RUN IN CRIBBAGEâ W. H. H.,
Joseph ine, El Dorado County, Cal. If in
a game of cribbage A plays 5. C 7, B 6, D
8 and A plays 5; B makes a run of 3, D
makes a run of 4 and A makes a run of
4 because there is the sequence of 5, C, 7,
8 from the last card played.
STUTTERINGâ C. A. W., City. The
habit of stammering or stuttering can be
counteracted by cultivation of its oppo
site habit of correct speaking, and this
can be acquired by due regard to the pro
cess of speech, the relation of breath to
articulate sounds, the positions of the
tongue and other oral organs in molding
the outward stream of air, and by patient
application of these principles in slow and
watchful exercise.
A VALUABLE HALF DOLLARâ C. 8..
City. A half dollar of 1838 coined in the
New Orleans mint commands a premium
of $14 50 to $24 50. Such a coin may be
identified by the mint mark "O" between
the bust and the date. The ornament
which loops the drapery on the bust
should not be mistaken for the "O."
That letter on the premium coin is be
tween the lower line of the bust and the
upper line of the date.
PORCELAIN ENAMELâ J. O'C., City.
The following are the materials used for
porcelain enamel on iron: Flint (quartz),
calcined and ground, 100 pounds; borax
glass (anhydrous borax), ground, fifty
pounds; mix, fuse together in a crucible
and let it cool slowly. Powder and mix
forty pounds of this glass with live
pounds of kaolin (potters' white clay)
and grind the mixture to a very fine paste
in water, pickle the vessel in dilute sul
phuric acid and scour with sand to
thoroughly cleanse its surface, then line
it with a coating of the paste described
! one-sixth of an inch in thickness and let '
it stand in a warm room until the coating
has partially dried, next dust over tho
surface of the paste coating (still moist)
I with the following powder and dry it in !
an oven at 212 degrees Fahrenheit: White !
: lead free from lead or arsenic, 125 pounds

I fused, powdered, moistened with water
i and dried. 20 pounds. To forty-five pounds
iof this add one pound of soda; mix I
thoroughly with a little hot water and
reduce to fine powder. When the coating j
on the iron has dried the vessel is put j
! into a muffle and the heat gradually in- i
creased until the glaze fuses, when it is i
taken out. more glaze powder is dusted
on and after a second heating allowed to
cool very slowly.
AGE FOR MARRIAGE-Parent, City.
The language in the letter of inquiry is
not clear enough to give a full under
standing as to what the correspondent '
wants, but it probably Is covered by the
following as to the age that individuals
can marry without consent of parents.
In all the States which have law? on the
subject, 21 years is the age for males. In
Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky
i Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Isl-
I and. South Dakota, Virginia, West Vir
ginia and Wyoming the age for females
is 21, but 18 in all other States having
laws, except Maryland, in which it is 16
years.
INCREASE OF COMMERCE.
Port Collector Jackson Speaks Flat-
teringly of the Business of
California.
The receipts in the customs department
at the port of San Francisco for the
month of October were $611,540 71, the
largest receipts for the month of October
since the year 1892, which marked the
high tide of prosperity under Harrison's
administration.
Customs Collector Jackson said yester
day that the business of this port has
increased so rapidly and so steadily dur
ing the past few years that it has out
grown the shipping facilities here There
are not nearly enough ships to earn
away the surplus . products of the State,
he said and he cited the fact that the
Mail dock is piled with goods awaiting
shipment to foreign ports, notwithstand
ing that three steamers have left the
dock since the pile was placed there.

POLITICAL RALLIES THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
Continued From Fifth Page.
Ira B. Dalzlel called the meeting to order
and spoke a few words of welcome to the
residents of the Thirty-eighth District,
not a seat was unoccupied. There was
nothing about the meeting that was not
of the genuine rally order. Horace Davis
was heralded by all the speakers as the
next Mayor of San Francisco, and the ap
plause that greeted the mere mention of
. his name spoke eloquently of the voting
I intentions of the citizens of the Thirty
j eighth District.
Special addressee were made by Colonel
T. V. Edly, Lucius Solomons, Major C.
W. Kyle, I. Golden, E. Myron Wolfe and
Horace Davis. Campaign issues were dis
cussed in a broad and liberal spirit by all
without oratorical affectation or political
! abuse. The candidates came into the hall
I in relays and told the people what the Re
; publicans have done and would do. An
occasional variation was furnished by the
! band, which played national airs to the
! satisfaction of all. The large crowd did
: not grow impatient, though the meeting
was a late one. and when the last speaker
had come and gone nothing could be
: heard but prolonged cheers for Horace
' Davis.

CONTINENTAL LEAGUE
INDORSES NOMINEES
J Continental League, ever true and loyal
j to the Republican party, held Its regular
! monthly meeting at Saratoga Hall, 814
Geary street, last night. Frank D. Worth,
president of the league, presided, wlia
; Hamilton J. Rig-gins as secretary. The
, meeting was far above the average in Its
membership present. The entire Repub
lican ticket from top to bottom was en
| thusiastlcally indorsed, and every mem
ber present pledged himself to its'support
j at the polls on next Tuesday.
GREAT MEETING AT
SIXTH AND FOLSOM
Bonfires and a large band were the
j harbingers that told the citizens of the
! Thirtieth District last night that a big
! Republican rally was being held. The
San Francisco Athletic Club on Sixth
street, near Folsom, was the place of the
meeting, and the crowd that gathered to
hear the speakers was both large and en
thusiastic.
Henry B. Russ presided at the meeting.
Early in the evening Horace Davis ar
rived. He spoke to the audience in a very
direct manner, telling them without em
bellishment just what he had done as a
public official, and what he would do if
fortunate enough to be elected the next
i Mayor of San Francisco. When Mr.
was Introduced he received ringing
applause, and when he finished it was
some tim<- before Mr. Russ could secure
silence to introduce the next speaker.
The candidates dropped in during the

will second in his fight against Curley.
He will spend the night at the Delevan
House, starting for Sagamore Ho.el,
Coney Island, early Friday morning, and
remaining there until called upon to face
Jeffries in the ring.
" The articles of agreement under which
Jeffries md Sharkey will right for the
heavyweight championship of the world
call for twenty-live rounds. They will
battle for 66 2-3 per cent of the gross
receipts, of which sum the winner will
receive 75 per cent.
Opinions of sporting men and pugilists
on the result 01 the contest are interest
ing. Peter Maher, considered by many
experts on pugilistic affairs the most
dangerous man in the ring to-day, picks
Sharkey. Maher has bet $350 against $750
that the sailor will win. He nays he likes
Sharkey best because the sailor's record
as a fighter is superior to Jeffries' ring
achievements. He says Jeffries has only
one good fight to his credit, and that was
with Fitzsimmons, but he does not think
that Fitwrtmmons fought properly when
he met the California.!!, or he would have
won.
George Considine gives as his reason
for selecting Shark, v the tatter's superior
pluck, hitting power and brute force.
He says SharKey cannot be knocked out
and in support of his opinion points to
the fact that Peter Ma-her, Kid McCoy
and Bob Fitzsimmons all knocked him
down, but could not make him uncon
scious. He regards Maher and Fitzsim
mons as harder fighters than Jeffries and
figures that Sharkey, who can deliver a
harder blow than the Californian, will
surely land a knock-out on Jeffries, who
he thinks cannot take very much punish
ment.
Al Smith figures Jeffries the winner be
cause he is taller, heavier, longer in reach
and from a scientific standpoint out
classes the sailor. Jimmy Wakeley's
views are precisely the same as Smith's.
Late to-night Tom Sharkey, through
his manager, Tom O'Rourke, bet $1700
against $1:000 with Martin Dowling and
I7ue against $1000 with "Nat" Goodwin on
himself against Jeffries.
The house promises to be the largest
that ever gathered for a pugilistic en
counter in New York or anywhere else in
this country. The sale of seats so tar ha 3
been tremendous, and if it keeps up the
house will be sold out. The boxes near
the stage went at $35 apiece, while the
best seats near the ring commanded from
$15 to $25. General admission is to cost
16, and it is expected that the size of the
gate receipts expressed in dollars will be
close to $100,000. Spectators will be in at
tendance from every State in the Union.
Several large delegations from the South
and Middle West got in to-day, and others
from California and the extreme West and
from New England will arrive to-morrow.
Hotel corridors and cafes ring with light
talk.
Sharkey's physician went down to see
him at noon to-day. He is Dr. Frank E
Butler, formerly of Bellivue Hospital,
New York. Dr. Butler, after remaining
with Sharkey all day, said:
"Sharkey Is in perfect condition. I have
watched him ever since he began work
and feel satisfied that he has developed to
its fullest possibilities each muscle in his
body. His blood, his digestion, all his in
ternal organs are in perfect condition
He Is not in the least stale, and I think
will be able to put up his best fight 1< rl
day night."
Betting in This City.
The odd? nn the big fight remained the
same in this city yesterday, 10 to 6. with
Jeffries favorite, being the ruling figures.
Tho dollar bettors in the mutucls at
Harry Corbetfs also favor the big fellow
on every line. Of the 85b tickets sold 494
were on Jeffries and 364 on Sharkey. The
majority of the bettors apparently" think
Jeffries will win somewhere between the
eighth and the eighteenth rounds. The
bonfire kept the atmosphere warm on the
outside.

POLITICAL.
Horace Davis and the New Charter.
Horace Davis is an honest, able man, of large experience in busi-
ness affairs, which well qualify him to perform the duties of Mayor
of this city.
He iii a faithful friend of the new charter and has worked for it
for years; also of good government, and will use every effort to
promote the prosperity and welfare of this city.
His deep interest in education shows him to be a good friend
of the public schools. His long residence in tnis city and his large
acquaintance with men will enable him to select the best men to
carry out the provisions of the new charter to the best advantage.
In ability, honesty and fidelity to good principles and sound
business methods. I consider him the peor of any man in this city,
and I am sure he will prove faithful to every interest placed in his
hands.
He is a stanch Republican of tried experience, faithful in every
relation of life, and his influence would be to uphold the patriotic
principles of the Republican party at home and abroad.
I am glad to heartily support the able and honest HoracÂ©
Davis for Mayor.

Charles N. Harris, who says that he ifi

respects to Mayor Phelan and that branch
of Democracy with which he affiliates at
a meeting held last evening at Metropoli
tan Temple. The speaker did not mince
words. He boldly asserted that the Mayor
was not v. Democrat and had taken ad
vantage of his reputed fealty to the De
mocracy to betray it and de'livcr it over
to its enemies. He said in part: "The
only thing that is worse than the avowed
policy of the Republicanism of these days
is the cool treachery of pretended Demo
crats. Fellow Democrats, see to it that
you put an end to traitorism next Tues
day. Save your schools from the bane of
the kind of politics which Mr. Phelan rep
resents and embodies. Save this city from
irresponsible and reckless expenditures
for ornamental improvements. Save this
city from an inveterate contempt for
every advanced idea or declaration con
tained in the new charter. Save the city
from bossism infinitely more absolute,
vicious and intolerate than any which has
ever reared its hydra head in the city of
San Francisco.
"Perform these duties and a hundred
fold more that could be named by voting
against the Phelanlstic Exarriinerism.
which is an unequivocal insult to society,
to public morals, to enlightened public con
science, to clean journalism, to clean
government, to genuine progress, to com
mercial and industrial enterprise, to true
Democracy, and in general to that fair
fame of San Francisco which nil good
citizens desire to cieate and uphold.

NOTORIOUS CROOK IS
LANDED BEHIND BARS
rhll Kramer, a notorious crook, who is
also known as "George Williams" and
"Frenchy," was arrested by Detectives
Dinan, Reynolds, Wren and Kd Gibson
i yesterday afternoon and locked up in the
i tanKs at the California-street police sta
tion. He will be formally charged with
burglary to-day. Kramer is suspected,
! with a good deal of reason, of being the
I perpetrator of numerous daylight burg
laries that have occurred in the Western
, Addition during the last few weeks. In
j at least two instances the police claim
the evidence against him is strong enough
!to insure his conviction on a felony
charge.
On Monday afternoon Kramer entered
the residence of Mrs. Gnihn, IGI'4 Bu
chanao street, while the family was ab-
Bent and stole a lot of valuable jewelry.
After leaving the Oruhn house he entered
the residence of T. F. Ross, 1478 Ellis
street, where he secured several diamond
rings and mhc-r articles of jewelry. In
Instance the burglar effected an en
trance by prying open a window with a
jimmy. The neighbors observed a strange
â  man loitering about during the afternoon,
and when the burglaries became known
they were able to describe him accurately.
The description fit Kramer so closely thnt
; the detectives detailed on the case by
| Captain Bohen immediately started on a
still hunt for the crook and experienced
mo trouble in making the arrest. Kramer
has nerved time in both Folsom and Sin
Quentin.
Some of the stolen Jewelry was found
on Kramer when he was searched at the
police station.

111. COMEDY OF ERRORS.
(Concluded.)
Notes on the Study of the Play.
1. This Is Shakespeare's one farcical
play. Its sources of laughter lie almost
wholly in the situations and incidents,
hardly at all in the characters. The spec
tator is railed on to accept much that is
i improbable for the sake of mere fun md
â  laughter-stirring surprises. So cleverly,
j however, are the incidents and persons
entangled and disentangled, so rapidly
does surprise follow surprise, that we
find no time to raise difficulties or offer
suggestions.
2. The date of the play cannot be ex
actly determined, but it is certainly one
of Shakespeare's very earliest. Antlpho
lus of Syracuse questioning Dromio about
the kitchen wench, who is so large and
round that she has been compared to a
globe, asks: "In what part of her body
stands France?" Dromio answers: "In
her forehead, armed and reverted, mak
ing war against her heir." France was
in a state of civil war, fighting for and
against her heir, Henry IV, from August,
1559, until February, 1594.
3. The subject of the comedy and much
of the plot are drawn from one of Plau
tus' dramas. Shakespeare transfers the
j scene from Epidamnune to Ephesus. that
I city which had an evil repute for its
roguery, licentiousness and magical prac
tices, a city in which such errors might
be supposed to be the result of sorcery
(Restoration of the Great Temple of Diana from the Lake.)-
and witchcraft-. To Shakespeare belongs
wholly the serious background, from
which the farcical incidents stand out in
reliefâ the story of the Syracusan mer
chant who almost forfeits his life in the
search for his lost children, and finally
recovers both the lost ones and his own
liberty.
4. Dr. Dowden points out the following
lines as among the most beautiful in the
play. "But," he adds, "such passages, in
which character or human passion rather
than incident chiefly interests us. are
rare." The old man, a prisoner before
the duke, finds that his son does not r?c
ognlze his face nor remember his voice:
Aeceon- Why look you strange on me? You
know me well.
Antlpholus of E.â l never saw you in my
life till now.
Aegeonâ O grief hath chang'd me since you
saw me last,
j And careful hours with time's deformed hand
Have written ?transe defeatures in my face:
j But tell me yet. dnst thou not know my voice?
Antiph-)!us of F..â Neither.
Aegeonâ Dromio, nor thou?
Dromio of E.-N", trust me, sir, nor I.
Aepeon â I am sure thou dost.
Dromio of E.â Ay, sir, but I am sure I do
not; and wha'~oever a man denies, you are
: now bound to believe him.
Aegeonâ Not know my voice! O time's ex
tremity.
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor
tongue
In seven short years thiu here my only son
Knows not my feeble key of untur.'d cares?
Though now this grained face of mine he hid
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
And all the conduits of my blood froze up.
Yet hath my night of Lie some memory,
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
My dull dear ears a little use to hear.
All these old witnesses-- 1 cannot errâ
Tell me thou art my aon Antipholus.
Antipholus of B.â l never saw my father in
my life.
Aegeonâ But seven years since, in Syracuse,
boy,
Thou know'st we parted; but perhaps, my son,
Thou sham'st to acknowledge ni' in misery.
5. "The Comedy of Errors" was played
on the evening- of Innocents' day (Dec
28), 1504. in the hall of Gray's Inn, before
a crowded audience of benchers, students
and their friends. There was some dis
turbance during the evennlg on the part
of the guests from the Inner Temple,
who, dissatisfied with the accommodation
afforded them, retired In dudgeon. "So
(hat night," the contemporary chronicler
states, "was begun and continued to the
end in nothing but confusion and errors,
whereupon it was afterward called tne
'Night of Errors.' " Shakespeare was
acting on the same day before the queen
at Greenwich, and it is doubtful if no
wort; present. On the morrow a commis
sion of oyer und terminer inquired into
the causes of the tumult, which was at
tributed to a sorcerer having "foisted a
company of base and common fellows to
make up cur disorders with a play of er
rors and confusions." A second perform
ance of the "Comedy of Errors" was
given at Gray's Inn hall by the Eliza
bethan Stage Society on December 8,
1595.â Sidney Lee.
6. In the plot thus carefully composed
there are at least two features worth our
notice. The first, at which we need merely
glance, is the vigorous effeot of dramatic
contrast produced by beginning this pro
longed farce with the romantic narrative
of Argon's shipwreck and misfortunes and
wandering's, and by ending it with the
still more romantic discovery that the
abbess of Ephesus Is the long-lost wife
whom he has so faithfully mourned. The
second 19 the fundamental source of all
the fun and troubleâ the elaborate, double
confusion of identity.â Barrett Wendell.
Georg Brandes' Estimate of the Play.
Thi* comedy on the frontier line of !
farce shows with what giant Strides
Shakespeare progresses in the technique
of his art. It has the blood of the theater
in its veins. We can already discern the
experienced actor in the dexterity with
which the threads of the intrigue are in
volved, and woven into an evermore in
tricate tangle, until the simple solution is
arrived at. While "Love's Labor's Lost" j
still dragged itself laboriously over the !
board, here we have an impetus and a
brio in all the dramatic passages which
roveal an artist and foretell a master, j
Only the rough outlines of the play are
taken from Plautus; and the motive, the j
possibility of incessant confusion between |
two masters and two servants, is manip- '
ulated with a skill and certainty which
astound us In a beginner, and sometimes
with quite irresistible whimsicality. No
doubt the merry play is founded upon an
extreme improbability. So exact is the
mutual resemblance of each pair of twins,
no less in clothing than In feature, that
not a single person for a moment doubts
their Identity. Astonishing resemblances
between twins do, however, occur In real
life, and when once we have accepted the
premises, the consequences develop nat
urally, or, at any rate, plausibly. We
may even say that in the art of intrigue
spinning, which was afterward somewhat
foreign and unattractive to him, the poet
here shows himself scarcely inferior to
the Spaniards of his own or a later day,
remarkable as was their dexterity.
Now and then the movement is sus
pended for the sake of an exchange of
word plays between master and servant,
but it is generally short and entertain
ing. Now and then the action pauses to
let Dromio of Syracuse work off one of
his extravagant witticisms, as, for exam
ple (Hi, 2):
I>romio 8. â And yet ehe Is a wondrous fat
marriare.
Antlpbolui S. â How d^st thcu mean a fat
marriage?
Dro. S â Marry, sir; she's the kitchen wench
and all pre&se: and I know not what use to put
her to but to make a lamp of her and run from,
her by her own light. I warrant her rags and
the tallow In them will burn a Poland winter;
if yhe lives till doomsday she'll burn a week
longer than the whole world.
As a rule, however, the interest Is so>
evenly sustained that the spectator is held
in constant curiosity and suspense as to
the upshot of the adventure.
At one single point the style rises to a
beauty and intensity which shows that,
! though Shakespeare here abandons him
j self to the light play of intrigue, it is a
I diversion to which he only condescends
' for the moment. The passage is that be-
EPHESUS.
I tween Lueiana and Antiphblus of Syra-
I cuse (iii, 2). with its tender erotic
cadences. Listen to such verses as these:
Ant. S. âSweet mistress (what your name is
else 1 know not.
Nor by what wondf-r you hit on mine),
i Less in your knowledge and your grace you
show not
Thun our earth's wonder, more than earth
rlivine.
j Teach n%e, dear creature, how to think and
speak;
Lay open to my earthly-gross conceit.
; Smothered In errors, feeble, shallow, weale.
; The folded meaning nf your words' deceit.
Against my soul's pure truth why labor you
To make it wander in an unknown field?
Arf you a god? Would you create me new?
Transform me, then, and to your power I'll
yield.
Since the play was first published in the
Fnlio of 1(123 it is, of course, not impossi
ble that Shakespeare may have worked
. over this lovely passage at a later period.
! But the whole structure of the verses.
with their interwoven, rhymes, points in
the opposite direction. We here catch
the first notes of that music which is soon
to rill "Romeo and Juliet" with its har
monics.
Dramatic History of the Play.
Though the situations developed in the
"Comedy of Errors" pass far beyond the
! bounds of even stage probability, never
â  theless when well acted the play is ex
] ceedingly effective and very popular. But
j the difficulty is to find actors sufficiently
â  resembling one another naturally or able
to make themselves sufficiently like one
another artificially to impersonate prop
| erly the characters of the two Dromios
and the two Antipholuses respectively.
'â¢ The most successful and splendid repre
', sentationa of the "Comedy of Errors"
I known to the history of the stage were
I those of the two American players Stuart
; Robson and William H. Crane. The first
of these representations was given in New
York in 1885. The two great comedians,
I of course, took the parts of the two Dro
â  mios. Crane was nine years younger than
Robson, and his voice naturally
waft utterly unlike Robson's voice,
; yet he would imitate Robson's pe
> culiarities of voice and manner in
such a way as to deceive the very
elect. But Robson and Crane's produc
! tion of the "Comedy of Errors" was no
: table not alone for the cleverness of the
acting of the two principals. It was in
every way the most complete and elab
orate presentation of the play ever made;
the only Shakespearean productions oom
â  parable to it being Sir Henry lrving's
: "Henry VIII," "The Merchant of Venice."
! etc. "Few great English nlayers have
taken part in the "Comedy of Errors."
'â  but among those who have done so may
1 be mentioned Charles Macklin (1741) and
; Charles Kemble (1SOR). _
Questions for Research and Review.

with characterization or mainly with in
; cidents and situations?
2. What varieties of incident and situa
: tion would have been impossible without
\ two Dromios?
3. Does the excess of improbability mi
i volved in twin brothers with twin ser
vants heighten or lessen the comic effect
as you read 9
4. 'Plow many scenes of this play are
] based on the theme of mistaken iden-
I tity?
5. Which of the scenes show an under
; lying thought that is not farcical? If
: you take the point of view of the social
reformer, for instance, do you find any
: tragic elements in this play? What
n-.ik'-s a situation tragic or comic in real
II fr?
t;. What is gained by the introduction
| of a serious element at the outset of the
play and of a pathetic element in the
last act?
7. Is a modern audience moved to laugh
ter by the discomfiture of a father and
husband like Egeon, even though the dis
comfiture be but temporary?
S. Do you think that act 111 rises above
ordinary farce? In what respect?
9. Would a modern audience find in the
"chain" incident of act 111 a subject of
pure enjoyment? Should we look for se
rious* consequences?
10. Is Adriana admirable or merely to
be laughed at? Is her husband merely
laughable? How do you feel toward him?
11. What role does Luciana play con
sistently in this drama?
12 There is. even in this early play of

in character. How is It brought out?
13. Does this comedy leave you with any
fixed notions of the true relation of hus
band and wife, father and soi\, sister and
sisttr?
14. Is the "rime-doggerel" in act 111 nec
essary or excusable?
15. There are 380 rhymed lines to 1150 un

How Walt Street Views the War.
The following extract from the New York
financial circular of Henry Clews, written be
fore the recent disasters to the British arms
In Natal, shows how Wall street looks at the
Boer war: . .
"When the Boers get one good whipping
the war will about end. and then the South
African gold mines will renew their flow of
gold to London. These mines are good here
after for $100,000,000 of gold per annum, which
is one-third of the world's present output.
Nothing will help good investment and active
speculative stocks to advance more than for
large amounts of the precious metal to pour
into London or New York from outside sec
tions of the world. If the African mines pro
duce at the rate of $100.0CO,OT>0 this year, which
they can easily do upon the return of peace,
it Will make the world's output $300,000,000â
the largest on record. This is the strongest,
safest and most legitimate basis for the in
flation of values that is possible."
The Lumber Trade.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says:
"The condition of the general lumber trade
en the Pa/;::..- Coast Is still Improving and
the manufacturers and dealers are beginning
to fenl that they have not forged along
through the past few years of trouble and
inquietude for no purpose. Prices are firm,
with a tendency toward an advance, white
October saw one of $1 and more on different
grades.
"Redwood and pine hold the fame relative
rank as during the last few months and will
continue to do so unless some unlooked-for
Influence makes its appearance. The pro
pose consolidation of the redwood Interests,
which has a most favorable aspect to-day.
may be this cause, but pine will always
have Its effect on the lumber markets of the
Pacific slope.
Ingles are making redwood most favor
ably known all over the Eastern States and
th? farmers esi>eclally desire them for their
spring Improvements on their houses and
barns. The Humboldt Shingle Manufac
turers' Association is now constructing a
Eteam schooner for the sole purr of carry
ing cargoes of shingles from Humboldt nay
to Newport or elsewhere, as the demands
dictate. This is the most forceful Illustra
tion of the importance attained by the red
wood Fhingle adjunct to the California lum
ber trade.
"Demands are heavy and frequent for all
kinds and grades of lumber, and the Pacific
Coast, with its present outlook of a rainy
season, can expect to be far up at the top
during 1900. The lumber companies and
machinery houses will enjoy a year of pro?
perity not surpassed before In the industrial
history of the West.
"The scarcity of available cars In the Pa
cific Northwest is working a hardship on the
lumbermen in Washington and Oregon."

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. Nov. I.â To-day's stock market
developed a decidedly spotty character. The
railroads fell into the background again, and
the highly speculative Industrials were brought
f rward in to activity. An effort was made to
continue- the campaign against the shorts In the
!r<>n and Â«teel !-tock. but the higher prices In
this group brought out such large sales that
the effort to advance prices had to be aban
doned. The whole group, with the exception of
Tennessee Coal, shows net lossee. When the
ment in the Iron and Bteel stock proved
,c the bulls turned their attention to
vn Transit, which was a favorite in
I ition for the rest of the day. The more-
It was again directed against
the rery heavy short interest believed to ex; B t
In it, and the rapid advance Induced large
covering When the rise had extended to above
M enormous blocks were bought out, which
made It difficult to mistarh the price The
stock rose to 80ft, yielded a point, rallied again
and again yielded a email fraction. The New
York traction group was strong in sympathy.
The leather stocks were also taken up for fur- !
ther aggressive ad vane*, the common touching:
22 and the preferred 83%. Sugar was active and
irregular, but shows a net gain. The tobacco
stocks were weak early, but rallied later. There i
were isolated movements In Missouri, Kansao !
and Texas. C. C. and St. Louis preferred, the
Pacific Coast stocks, Wisconsin Central. New
York Airbrake and Standard Rope, which were j
all strong. Malting preferred declined 8 points. i
Otherwise the trading was very active, and
the movement In prices was narrow, net
changes being small and mixed. Owing to the
holiday in London pressure from that point j
was relaxed. The call money market worked
appreciatively easier during the afternoon, ;
after having ruled at 15 to 20 per cent. Large
amounts were loaned at 6 per cent before the j
close, and the rate fell to 5 per cent. The eas
ier rat* for money did not Induce any large
ventures on the long side In stocks, but the
bears were manifestly uneasy and anxious to !
cover short lines before the tendency in money
relaxes. To-day's advance in sterling exchange i
18 believed to be evidence of a real relaxation
in the money stringency, and New York ex
change at Chicago and St. Louis was strong
to-day, showing a cessation of pressure from
those points. At Boston, m the contrary, there
was a sharp decline In New York exchange.
Money continues to move In the South, and the
Sub-Treasury Is making drafts on the local
banks.
The bond market was quiet, aside from an
active demand for Standard Rope Incomes and
Kansas and Texas seconds. Total sales, par ;
value, $2,075,000.

CHICAGO, Nov. Wheat made a sudden
drop of 'ie at the opening and continued slow
throughout the session. As the little strength
which characterized the market here yesterday
was In anticipation of higher quotations from
Liverpool as a result of severe military re
verses to the British army In South Africa
the trade became demoralized when the re
verse of that expectation occurred. There was
very little else to encourage selling, but specu
lators became so bearish that in their eager
ness to find purchasers the market slumped
off steadily and closed decidedly weak within
a fraction of the lowest point touched during
the day. A steady Increase in local stocks,
together with an excessively slow cash de
mand, added to the selling movement during
the late trading. . December opened %@',4c
lower at 69%@70c, sold sparingly at 70c, de
clined to 69Uc, and closed with sellers at
6&Vi(g69SÂ£,c. This establishes a new low record
for the December option this year, the lowest
point reached previously being 69%e.
Corn snowed considerable heaviness sympa
thizing with the decline in Wheat. Short sell
ing was the order of the day, under which the
market yielded steadily until near the close,
when country buying started a rally. The
bulge only added increased vigor to the sell-
Ing movement and the market continued Its
downward course until the end. December
closed with sellers at 31 Vie.
Light receipts and fair cash Inquiry coun
terbalanced heavy selling In Oats and the mar
ket after a slight dip early held steady the
remainder of the session. December closed at
22% c.
Provisions were slow and weak. The decline
In Corn, excessive receipts of Hogs and lower
prices at the yards were the depressing In
fluences. January Pork closed 10c lower at
}:â¢ 6009 62 /4; January Lard, 5@7',4c lower at
to 25Â®6 27%, and January Ribs 5c lower at
$4 90.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Nov. I.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The past
week has been the most remarkable one In
point of activity ever known in the Boston
Wool market. For the first time In its history
the weekly record has crossed the 20,000,000
--pound mark, the actual sales, so far as we can
ascertain, being 21, ."57, 500 pounds. This aston
ishing showing is the result of an intensely
active demand^ largely from consumers of all
descriptions. As to prices, the tone of the
market it, very strong. Advices from abroad
continue to show a hardening tendency. Not
withstanding the radical advance which has
occurred in American markets prices of Wool
In this country are still relatively considerably
lower than those abnad. and there are many
who believe that there is to be no permanent
relief until more Wool Is fc-rown generally.
The sales of the week In Boston amounted to
19,067.000 pounds domestic and 2,490.500 pounds
foreign, making a total of U, 637,600, against a
total of 10.071.200 for the previous week, and a
total of 9,069,000 for the corresponding week last
year. Sales since January 1. 1599. amount to
270,602,800 pounds, against 102,526.510 last year
at this time.

Â«
DEMOCRATS FIGHT STEPHENS
COLORED CITIZENS ARE ALSO
UP IN ARMS.
They Have Not Forgotten the Insult
Offered Them by the Man Who
Is Now Seeking Their
Votes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. Unless some
thing: unforeseen happens George 11.
Clark will surely win the Mayoralty light.
Hacked by the most Influential men of the
city "Gentleman George," as he is fa
miliarly known to his associates, is mak
ing wonderful progress in his canvass for
votes and according to the political wise
acres his election is assured. As an In
centive to win votes for htm his sup
porters have advanced the argument that
inasmuch as Sacramento has entered on
a new era of prosperity It behooves every
citizen who has the interest of the city
at heart to elect a young and experi
enced man like Clark to handle the reins
of government.
R. D. Stephens, tho Democratic candi
date, is steadily losing ground and his
supporters are correspondingly uepressed.
Iwadore Alexander, his chief lieutenant,
has about given up the tight.
The colored citizens, still pmarting un
der the gratuitous insult aimed at them
by Stephens when ho was a member of
the Legislature of 1870, are working hard
to secure tho election of Clark. Last
night they held an enthusiastic meeting
at which resolutions were passed strongly
indorsing the candidacy of the Repub
lican standard-bearer.
Many of Clark's friends predict that he
will win ':â â  500 votes, while others place
his majority at 1000, Clark is so confident
of success that he intends to rest, so to
speak, until the day of the election.
"I cannot see how I can lose," he con
fidently remarked to-night. Stephens is
making a strong tight, but I think I have
a shade the better of it. My friends are
work:: imWutlgubly in my Interest and
if their encouraging reports continue
coming In there is no doubt in my mind
that I will be the next Mayor of Sacra
mento. I thoroughly understand the
needs of the city and am in hearty ac
cord with everything That tends to pro
mote Its interest. I have made a clean
light, free from personalities, and have
thus won the friendship of a number of
men who had first intended to vote for
my opponent. When elected I shall en
deavor to run the government on strictly
clean and economical principles."
A large number of Democrats are op
posing Stephens for the reason that he
voted for Palmer at the Presidential
election. They nre making a vigorous
fight against him for this reason and are
hopeful of encompassing his defeat.

THE SAff FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1899.
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
LONG LIFE OF
CAPTAIN BADGER
EBBING AWAY
Rewarded Years Ago
for Bravery.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 1.
Captain Thomas W. Badger is seriously
ill at his home in East Oakland, and but
little hope is entertained for his recov
ery. The captain is one of the best known
pioneers of this city, and indeed at one
time owned, a large portion of the terri
tory on which modern Oakland is built.
He Is an old sailor-pioneer, having fol
lowed a life at sea until he landed in
San Francisco on the sth of August, 1849.
For a long while he engaged in the ship
ping business in San Francisco, and had
vessels trading all over the coast until
1872, when he retired from that business
and interested himself in his public park
at Brooklyn, East Oakland, which he
purchased in 1861. Eleven years later he
commenced building his great pavilion at
Badger's Park, and after an expenditure
of $50,0Ck> Badger's Grand Central Park
was thrown open to the public. The re
sult was an Immediate success, and his
park, dancing hall, ten-pin alley, mu
seum, amphitheater, menagerie, flower
garden and sailing pond were very ex
tensively patronized until they were de
stroyed by fire many years ago.
One of the most valued possessions
of the old captain was presented to him
in 1858. It was a silver trumpet, sub
scribed for by citizens "in token of their
high appreciation of Captain Badger's
conduct on board the steamer Central
America at the time of the loss of that
ill-fated vessel." The steamer was on a
trip from Aspinwall to New York and in
rough weather was wrecked. Her cap
tain and officers were among the lost and
Captain Badger assumed management
of the foundering steamer, which he kept
afloat until relief came from a Nor
wegian bark. To his efforts was attrib
uted the saving of nearly 200 lives. On
arriving- at New York the citizens at once
subscribed to give him a memento of their
recognition of bis bravery, and he could
just as easily have had a large sum of
money as a silver trumpet, but he de
cllmd, although in the wreck he lost
in coin which he had made in Cal
ifornia.
Under tho administration of Governor
Ilnlght Captain Badger was a Pilot Com
missioner of San Francisco, and held the
office for many yenrs. His large hold
ings have very materially decreased, and
about two years when the City Council
proposed to make some very extensive im
provements near Badger's Park the old
captain appeared before that body and
said that if the Council were determined
to carry out these improvements It
would bankrupt him entirely. He closed
a very earnest appeal by telling them
that after he was gone would be timÂ«>
enough to go ahead with the proposed
work.
HAS BECOME FAMOUS AS
CHAMPION OF HER SEX
MRS. CARRI.d CHAPMAN CATT
TO SUPPORT SUFFRAGE.
The Able Lieutenant of Susan B. An
thony Here to Assist the Cause
of Woman's Rights.
At the California Hotel there arrived
last evening Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt
of New York, chairman of the committee
on organization of the National Woman's
Suffrage Association, and Mary G. Hay,
secretary of the pame committee.
The two ladles came from Oregon,
whore they have been for some time past
attending to the Interests of their Bex
in the matter of the suffrage amendment
now pending in that State.
Mrs. Catt has not been here since IRWS, :
when she came out to the coast to use
her Influence in behalf of the suffrage
amendment In this State, which move
ment was defeated notwithstanding her
influence exerted in Its behalf.
Mrs. Catt and her secretary came out
this time to attend the meeting of the
State Woman's Suffrage Association,
whiÂ«Â»h is to take place at Golden Gate
Hall on Sntter street In the near future.
Mrs. Catt is looked upon as the one on
whom the mantle of SuÂ«an B. Anthony
will fall as soon as that redoubtable
leader relinquishes thn gavnl which she
has wielded so long and so ably. Mrs.
c.itt |s said to be eminently fitted for the
position which she may so soon be called
upon to fill. Gifted with a charming
personality, absolute fearlessness, a
quick, bright mind and splendid executive
ability, sh<- eomlnnea those traits with a
carefully trained diplomacy and marked
oratorical ability, snaking In herself a foe
worthy the Steel of the strongest opponent
that the opposite sex can put forward to
do battle against the ambitions of the
gentler portion Of humanity.
Mrs. Catt was born in Ripon, Wis.. in a
y< ar which gallantry has failed to chron
icle. She was educated at the State in
dustrial College of lowa, in which State
phe spent most of her life studying the
science of law. During late years she
has spent most of her time between
Washington and California, though she
has made frequent trips throughout the
Union in pursuance of her chose* work,
during which tlmo she has spoken In ovep
half of the States.
Mrs. Catt has a husband In New York
who is a prominent business man. being
heavily Interested in the San Francisco
Kridere Company, the interests of which,
In the East, he looks after.
IMPORTANT TO HOMESTEADERS.
Supreme Court Hands Down Decision
That May Affect Many.
In filing a declaration of homestead a
person must comply with the strict let
ter of the statute in order that the prop
erty may be protected from forced sale.
This Is the substance of a decision handed
down yesterday by the Supreme Court in
the suit of R. M. Reid and wife against
tlie Englehart-Davidson Mercantile Com
pany to quiet title to their home In San
lU-rnardino County.
The case Is of more than passing
note, because It brlnge out a point in law
which may hava been overlooked by thou
sands of homestead holders. The mer
cantile company recovered judgment in a
Justice Court and Reid's interest was sold
by the Sheriff under an execution, tho
company buying in the property.
Reid and his wife brought action to
quiet title, setting up the claim that the
land was protected by homestead. They
won their case.
In discussing the case on appeal Jus
tice Harrison recites that the declaration
made by E. M. Reid reads: "I hereby
declare that I am married, and that I db
now actually reside with my family on
that certain land, etc."
The statute sets forth that a homestead
not exceeding $0000 In value may be se
lected and claimed by any "head of a
family." Reid In his declaration failed
to state that he was the head of a family
and the statement "I hereby declare that
I am married" Is defective In not show
ing that he is the head of a family. In
other words, "the Legislature, has pre
scribed certain formalities and conditions
which are essential to the selection of a
homestead, and which formalities and
conditions cannot be disregarded by
courts." The Judgment was reversed.

and the hands of Boysen, who was in
the saloon, quickly came as near the
celling as we could make them. The
fellows told us to turn to the wall and
k*ep our backs toward them, and we
did so. One of the men flew to the
wall and pulled off the telephone and
threw it on the floor. Another one
kept us covered with his .gun, while
the third robber quickly scooped the
money off the counter and out of the
till into his pocket; then he took my
pocketbook out of my pocket and aald
he would not bother with the other
men as he knew they hadn't a <â < nt
anyhow. The whole thing occupied
about two minutes, and when the, rob
bers left they told us not to turn
around for five minutes, or we would
repent it. We followed their advice.
Altogether they got a little over $SO."
The saloon is located at Second and
Washington streets, which is a very
solitary and dark section of town at
night time. The three men in the sa

the only weapon in the place was a
shotgun carefully packed in a case be

of the victims dared retreat while cov

McFEELY GAVE
GOOD ADVICE
TO HIS WIFE
Divorce Follows a
Harsh Letter.
4
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 1.
Therese C. McFeely Is now at liberty to
follow her husband's' advice and marry
again. She has been divorced from James
K. McFeely, who deserted her over four
years ago.
McFeely had no Idea when he wrote a
certain letter to his wife from Vallejo
that it would be used in a manner such as
to make him pay her an additional
monthly allowance. In this letter Mc-
Feely calmly says he is tired of working
for the benefit of his wife and three chil
dren and he prefers to blow his money in
on himself. He suggests to his wife that
if she doesn't like the treatment he gave
her when they were living together she
had better go and seek another husband
and ruin his life, as she had ruined Me-.
Feely's.
According to the wife's statements the
treatment McFeely accorded her in the
past is guch as would very likely induce
her to seek a change. His chief pastime
seunie.l to be getting intoxicated and beat
ing his wife. Once he changed his pro
gramme by kicking her while she was at
tending to her baby, nine days old.
On another occasion Mrs. McFeely tim
idly suggested to her husband that it was
not the proper thing for him to be run
ning around with another woman and
spending his money on her while his own
children were going barefooted. This so
angered the husband that he threatened
to bring in the other woman and let her
horsewhip his wife while he laughed at
the pastime.
Mi i'Â« ely made no effort to oppose his
will's application for freedom anrl she
was given a decree, the children, alimony,
counsel fees and costs of the suit. Mc-
Feely is an engineer, and his family lives
in WeÂ«t Oakland.

DISCHARGED AND
SICK MEN HOME
OK THE PUEBLA
One Hundred Sent to
the Hospital.
The transport City of Puebla arrived
from Manila yesterday, completing the
fastest round trip on record. She left
here about two months ago, and during
the run to the Philippines and back she j
was stopped only once at sea, and then !
only for four minutes to key up some of .
the bolts. During the voyage the Puebla !
I rode out two typhoons and had a heavy j
head sea to contend with all the way i
from Nagasaki to San Francisco. Cap
tain Thomas brought his ship into port
in splendid shape and a stranger looking
her over would never think she was a
troop ship.
The Puebla brought from Manila eight
cabin passengers, 105 invalids, 15 of the
hospital corps and 79 discharged soldiers.
The cabin passengers were Major C. B.
Hinton, Second Lieutenant W. S. Brown,
acting quartermaster; Major H. J. Ray
mond, surgeon; First Lieutenant F. C.
Weaver, acting assistant surgeon; M. Jo
sephson, commissary clerk; Henry Page
and Miss Mona Bowman and Mrs. K. Be
dell, nurses.
There were seven deaths on the trans
port during the voyage from Manila. Pri
vate E. A. McKinney, Company E, Nine
teenth Infantry, died on October 6; Pri
vate M. B. Gavin, Company H, Thirteenth
Infantry, died October 13; Private W. H.
Reynolds, Company I, Thirteenth Infan
try, died October 15; Private Ivan Ran
dolph, Company D, Seventeenth Infantry,
died October Yh; Corporal Randolph Wolf,
Company E, Seventeenth Infantry, died
I October 19; Corporal Lewis Erlenwein,
Company F, Twelfth Infantry, died Oc
tober 27; and Private John Butler, Com
pany B, Twenty-first Infantry, died Oc
tober 28.
During tlie run from San Francisco to
Manila there was one death on the ship
that cast a gloom over the entire crew.
On September 18 William Lyons, the chief
cook, died of consumption. The deceased
was known from one end of the coast to
the other, having served for years as
chef on the steamers Umatilla, Queen,
Orizaba and others. About three years
ago he was attacked with smallpox and
the Umatilla, on which ship he was at
that time, was Quarantined.
Lyons was taken sick with pneumonia
soon after the Puebla left port. Every
thing possible was done for him but with
out avail. He was buried at sea with all
possible honors. Captain Thomas stopped
the ship and set the flags at half mast.
Chaplain Freeland read the burial service
and a soldier choir sang a number of ap
propriate hymns. The bodies of the men
who died on the homeward trip were em
balmed and will be forwarded to their
i relatives as soon as discharged from the
j tr The P sick men on the Puebla went direct
to the Presidio hospital. The .quart, r
master's steamer McDowell went along
side the transport in the stream and took
them all abuard.
The following Tennessee boys came as
far as Nagasaki on the Puebla: R. fa.
Coulter E. W. Rollon. Clay H. Stacker,
Bovd Johnson, J. N. Rendle, C. L. Eaker,
J C. Kendrick, J. H. Tale, M. Martin
dale, J. N. Warton, M. J. Pierce and R.
IC. Crutchfleld. From Yokohama they
took passage for Hongkong and from
there are going to Europe. After seeing
the Paris Exposition they will make a
tour of the world before returning home.
The remains of Captain Maurice o.
Kravenbuhl. Third Artillery, and Captain
Hogiirdus Eldridge, Fourteenth infantry,
also came up on the Puebla. Captain
Kravenbuhl was killed in a train wrecked
by the insurgents near San Fernando, and
Captain Eldridge was killed in a skir
mish near Malabon.
For the first time since the troops com
menced to return from Manila then Is no
Slate volunteer regiment quartered at the
Presidio. The Washington and lowa reg
iments were mustered out yesterday and
left the camp. ,
It took nearly $300,000 to pay off the two
regiments, but it was all got through
with in good timp, and by early evening
there was not a soul in either camp. The
lowa men started East at once. Their
trains were scheduled to leave at 2 o'clock
and there was no delay in getting them
away.
The Washington men will not go home
together. The plan of sending some by
land and some by sea has not been
changed, and so the men will not arrive
at the same time nor will they all go as
far as Sealtie. Most of those going by
rail will go direct to their homes. Before
leaving yesterday the men gathered
around Colonel Wholley's tent to Bay
good-by to him. Colonel Wholley will be
examined for promotion to a captaincy in
the regular service and will then go East
to join the Forty-first Regiment, in which
he holds a commission as major. He will
return to the Philippines by way of Suez.
The lowa regiment left several men in
the general hospital, they being too sick
to leave their wards. They were dis
charged with the other men of the regi
ment, but they will be cared for in the
hospital until they are in a condition to
leave it. The men left behind are Ser
geant Frank A. Baker and Harry ML
! Woods of Company A. Elmer Narver of
! Company D. William A. McLean and Ira
Baird of Company E. Riley D. Stephens
of Company G and Corporal Hugn M.
Goff and Edward Woods of Company L.
Th* Forty-fourth Regiment has taken
possession of the camp formerly occupied
by the Minnesota men. It is the first of
the outgoing regiments to be quartered
in the camp of the returning volunteers.
There was an Inspection of the Thirty
eighth Regiment yesterday by Lieutenant
Colonel Marlon P. Maus, inspector gen
eral of volunteer?. Every officer and man
was present with one exceptionâ First
Lieutenant Kelly, who had 6et yesterday
for hlfi wedding day. He was granted
permission from headquarters to take a
Â§ay off in order that he might meet his
bride-elect at the ferry when she arrived
! from the Enst, and then hunt up a suita
ble clergyman and have the knot tied.
It will be the turn of the Forty-fourth
to-day. _
First Lieutenant George Curry of the
Eleventh Cavalry has reported for duty
as quartermaster of the stock ship Cone
maugh. and First Lieutenant Keen of the
same regiment has reported for similar
duty with the Leelanaw.
Captain George A. Detchmendy of the
Twenty-second Infantry has been as
signed to the Pathan as quartermaster |
and commissary.
Leave of absence for one month has
i been granted to Major William B.
' Wliocler of the Eighteenth Infantry, who <
has been at the general hospital.
Acting Assistant Surgeon James TV Pns
cne has been ordered to procood to Seat
tle to report on board the transport Port
Stephens for duty during her trip to Ma
nila.
Miss Lillian G. Lane, nurse, now on
duty at tho general hospital, has been
ordered to her home in Salom. Mass., her
contract having been annulled.
Major James Allen of the Signal Corps
has been ordered to proceed to Manila on
the transport Hancock.
Miss Delia Weeks, a contract nurse, has
been ordered to proceed to her home in
Dcs Moines lowa, her contract having
been annulled.
A report from the Thirty-fifth Regiment
| dt Honolulu brings the information that
: Major J. C. Schulte of that rr-giment is
j under arrest for drunkenness. When the
transport arrived at Honolulu the major
went ashore, and when he again reached
the ship he was very much the worse for
his shore experience. He was ordered to j
his quarters, and wall still in confinement
when the ship left the islands.

partment of civics. Dr. Dorothea Moore
; chairman, held an interesting session in
I the clubrooms in the Y. M. C. A. build
ing, and in the afternoon an informal

TO TRY SUISSER.
i Ten of the Necessary Twelve Jurors
Accepted.
SALINAS, Nov. I.â Another day has
been consumed by lawyers in the Superior
| Court endeavoring to secure twelve com-
I petent men to try George Suisser. the
murderer of Sheriff Farley. After ar.
'â  arduous day's work five more men were
! secured; and up to the present time ten
I have been accepted out of over a hundred
examined.
Public opinion is strong against Suisser
and there are few citizens in the county
that have not a fixed opinion against the
defendant. It is not likely that testi
! mony can be taken in the case before Fri
j day. A special venire was ordered this
afternoon for twenty-two men, from
which it is expected two can be obtained.

ASK THE PRESIDENT
TO APPOINT WHEELER
EIOLiLO'WING is the petition now tn circulation and helm? slewed by the
commercial interests of this city and coast to President McKlnley ask-
I Ing him to appoint William R. Wheeler to the vacant place on the Inter
s'.. 1 ' Commerce Commission:
To the President, Washington, D. C. â
Your Excellency: We, your petitioners,
respectfully beg to represent that the
great amd manifest interests of the Pa
cific slope should fairly entitle that
section of the United States to represen
tation on a body like the Interstate Com
merce Commission, whose duty it is to exer
cise a supervision over the interests of
all parts of the country.
We further represent that, after the
time of the resignation of Hon. William W.
J. Calhoun of Illinois from said Commis
sion, while we respectfully addressed you
through our different commercial bodies
requesting that a Pacific Coast man may be
appointed, we refrained from mentioning
the name of, or indorsing any one for the
position, until such time as we could indi_
cate to you the unanimous choice of the
business interests of the whole coast.
A convention has just been held in this
city of the Pacific Coast Jobbers' and
Manufacturers' Association, which was at
tended by representatives from every line
of business from the States of Washing
ton, Oregon and California. At that con
vention the matter of indorsing some one
for the vacancy caused by the resignation
of Mr. Calhoun was taken up, and Mr. W. R.
Wheeler of this city was the choice, with
out one dissenting vote.
Of Mr. Wheeler's fitness for the posi
tion we are thoroughly informed and satis
fied, and we therefore request your Excel
lency that he be appointed to fill the
vacancy, and we, your petitioners, will
ever pray.

to Go to War.
â â¦ â
' The Pacific Mall Company's steamer
China for the first time in ten years of
1 continuous service came into .port late.
I She was looked for on Monday night, but
I did not arrive from the Orient until early
yesterday morning. , The delay was due
to the coal famine at Honolulu..
that no fuel could be obtained at the isl
ands the company cabled the captain at
i Yokohama to come along slowly and
j economize the coal. In consequence the
i China came from Yokohama under three
' boilers instead of six, which number she
; generally uses.
; The China brought up 97 cabin. 19 sec
ond cabin and 421 Chinese passengers. On
' October 25 she met the transport Ohio,
bound into Honolulu. The Ohio has . the
Nevada cavalry and 250 discharged sol
diers aboard. ,
1 Miss Birdie Bean was among the
China's passengers. The young lady
dressed in boy's clothes and stowed her
! self away on the transport City of Para.
1 The second day out the civilians aboard
; the transport were mustered for vaccina
tion and Miss Bean's sex was discovered.
She was put ashore at Honolulu, where
friends cared for her. The young lady as
serts that she was a reporter on a Stock
ton paper and was going to Manila as a
i correspondent. She begged to be allowed
to continue on her way, but the officers
of the transport were obdurate and Miss
Bean was left behind in Hawaii.
Among the passengers was Captain
! Whiting who went to Manila in command
iof the Monadnock. He was taken ill at
Hongkong and his wife nursed him back
to lite, The captain and his wife will go
East in a few days.
The ship Charles E. Moody, from Nor
folk Va., for Honolulu, had not arrived
when the China sailed. The rate of re
' insurance on the overdue vessel advanced
! to Co per cent yesterday afternoon.
The Toyo Kisen Kaisha Company s
steamer Hongkong Maru sailed for the
Orient yesterday afternoon, and the
Oceanic Steamship Company's Moana for
Australasia last night. Both vessels were
crowded with passengers and freight. On
the Moana there was not a berth to be
got for love or money, while among her
cargo were 250 tons of apples and 20,000
cases of canned goods. The remains of
James R. Holt, who died at the Lane
Hospital on October 27, went back to
Honolulu on the Moana. The deceased
was well known in Hawaii, and came here
; to undergo an operation.
Among those who sailed on the Moana
' were Colonel George W. Bell, United
States Consul General at Sydney, N. S.
W., and Ackland Hood and wife. . Mr.
Hood came here from New Zealand to
marry Miss Fitzpatrick of this city. He
is now taking his bride home. A host of
friends were down to see them off last
night. Miss L. Carey, daughter of Cap
tain Carey, who has been on a three,
months' visit to San Francisco, also went
: home on the Moana.
Among the Hongkong Mam's passen
gers for Honolulu were Mother Judith
Brassier, Sister Elizabeth Del, Sister
i Louise Malgret, Sister Albano Labrone
. and Rev. Father John Wegle. They are
I eoing to the Molokal leper settlement.
Rev. H. B. Gait and wife are missionaries
' bound for Shanghai, and Commander F.
P. Gilmore, U. S. N., Is going to Hong
kong to take command of one of the
! Spanish ships captured during the battle
of Manila.
The ship c. F. Sargent, which left here
i for Puget Sound last Saturday, arrived
:at Port Townsend yesterday morning.
This Is the fastest trip made in a. long
time. About three years ago the British
ship Drumrock went up In a little over
three vs. She went out in a south
easter, and Pilot Freeman was carried
away on her. About thirteen years ago
: the ship Bonanza made the run up in
sixty-eight hours, which is the record.
"Johnny" Cane is no longer shipping
i master for the Shipowners' Association.
He severed his connection with that body
! yesterday, and Charles McCarthy was ap
; pointed in his place. McCarthy knows
every Bailor on the beach, and as shipping
master for American vessels has made a
good record for himself.
The British ship Metropolis arrived from
Newcastle, Australia, yesterday in the
I fast time of fifty-one days. On September
2 John Adams, one of the crew, died from
natural causes and was buried at sea.
The Harbor Commissioners met yester

BANKERS ARE GRATEFUL
Alfred P. Blacli's Prosecution of For-
gers Becker and Creegan Is
Appreciated.
Alfred P. Black, Republican nominee
for District Attorney, won the grati
tude and esteem of business men
throughout the country when he se
cured the sending of Charles Becker,
the "prince <>f forgers," to the State
prison. Becker is the remarkable for
ger -who raised a Woodland bank draft
from $12 to $22,000, and Becker's pal,
James Creegan, got the money at a
bank in this city. So cleverly was the
forgery done that even after it was
known to be spurious none could de
tect the forgery without a magnifying
glass. Mr. Black considered such a
man as Becker extremely dangerous to
be at large and followed him relent
lessly until he cut away every possi
ble defense. Then Becker pleaded
guilty and was sent to the State prison,
where he is serving out his sentence.
Creegan is also in the State prison.
Bankers and business men realize that
Alfred P. Black is the right man for
District Attorney, and accordingly they
will give him their support.

The difference of cost between a
good and a poor baking pow=
der would not amount for a fam=
ily's supply to one dollar a year.
The poor powder would cost
many times this in doctors' bills.
Royal Baking Powder may cost a little
more per can, but it insures perfect,
wholesome food. In fact, it is more
economical in the end, because it goes
further in leavening and never spoils
the food.
Royal Baking Powder used always in
making the biscuit and cake saves both
health and money.
You cannot, if you value good health, afford
to use cheap, low-grade, alum baking pow-
ders. They are apt to spoil the food ; they
do endanger the health. All physicians will
tell you that alum in food is poisonous.

JOHN A. RUSSELL
SUDDENLY STRICKEN
JOHN A. RUSSELL, the veteran clerk of the Board of Supervisors, I
suffered a paralytic stroke in his office yesterday afternoon, and his
physicians entertain grave fears for his recovery. Mr. Russell was en- I
gaged in compiling the annual report of the Board of Supervisors when
the shock came, and without warning ho fell from his high chair pros- * :
trate on the floor. Dr. Lawlor, who was immediately summoned, found
that the right side was completely paralyzed. Though his power of speech I
was Impaired, Mr. Russell still retained consciousness, and after several ap
plications of electricity his condition had improved to such an extent that I
at 6 o'clock he was removed '<> his apartments at the Lick House.
"The attack is quite serious, though not necessarily fatal," said Dr. Law- I
lor, Mr. Russell's attending physician, when seen last night. "His right
side is completely paralyzed and his face is drawn very tightly. During his I
iife Mr. Russet has taken exceptionally good care of his constitution, and
this may he a potent factor in bringing about his ultimate recovery." I
John A. Russell is one >>f the best and most popularly known public offi
cials in the City Hall. He has been connected with the Board of Supervisors I
for a period of some thirty-three years, and he is familiar with every act
passed by that bury during that time. As a student of law governing mv- |
nicipal affairs Mr. Russell has no peer, and his memory on these matters has
on mure than on occasion saved the Hoard of Supervisors from becoming i
hopelessly involved in litigation.
John A. Russell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1522. He came to
California in the early rush for gold and worked at the diggings and ac
cumulated a few thousand dollars in gold dust.
In 1850, while in San Francisco, he invested his money in a small sloop
and, with his partner, engaged in the business of feathering eggs from the
Farallon Islands. Soon after establishing a lucrative trade in San Francisco
Mr. Russell was deserted by his partner, who sailed away with the sloop and
was never heap!
In February. 1866, Mr. Russel] assumed the duties of the office of clerk of
the Board of Supervisors, and has acted in that capacity continuously since.
