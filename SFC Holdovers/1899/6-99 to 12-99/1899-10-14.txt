BRITISH TROOPS IN NATAL
BATTLE WITH THE BOERS
General White's Forces En
gage Their Relentless Foes,
but the Outcome of the Con
flict Is Not Known.
Burghers From the Transvaal Also
Attack Mafeking and Are Re
ported to Have Suffered Several
Temporary Repulses.
LONDON, Oct. 14.â An
Edinburgh paper, the
Scotsman, this morning
asserts that a battle has taken
place between the forces of
General Sir George Stewart
White, commanding in Xatal,
and the Boers, who entered
Natal by way of Van Reenan's
Pass. General White, the Scots
man says, is very sanguine of the
success of the British movement.
The foregoing report is con
sidered to be correct, as late last
night the War Office had news
of a British advance from Lady
smith and was hourly expecting
further intelligence.
A dispatch to the Daily Tele
graph from its correspondent at;
Ladysmith, dated, at noon on i
Friday, says:
"A strong mobile column un
der General Sir George Stewart !
White, accompanied by General !
Sir Archibald Hunter, proceeded

I eral White's object was to ob
serve what was going on and
j also to test the mobility and effi
ciency of his forces. All his men
are well and the weather is now
fine."
According to dispatches from
Ladvsmith to the Standard and
the 'Daily Telegraph, dated
Thursday, heavy storms have be
gun and forage is scarce on the
veldt. Therefore nothing is ex
pected to happen for a few days
unless the Boers, who were re
ported to be advancing, should
threaten the British line of de
fense drawn from Glencoe Junc
tion to Ladvsmith. In this case,
according to the dispatches, no
apprehension is felt as to the re
sult. General White has twelve
guns and the Boers eleven.
The Daily Mail's Cape Town
correspondent, telegraphing on
Thursday evening, says: "I learn
on good authority that the Boers
are attacking Mafeking. They
are reported to have already suf
fered several repulses. It is gen

cannot stand a strong Boer at
tack."
According to the Daily Mail's
Cape Town correspondent, Mr.
Schremer, Premier of Cape
Colony, will unreservedly sup
port the imperial Government.
His previous reserve was dic
tated by a desire not to drive the
extreme Dutch residents to ex
cesses. According to the same
authority the Railway Depart
ment had early intimation of the
intention of the Boers to destroy
railway bridges over fourteen
streams, and sent adequate forces
to protect these points. The re
sult was that the Boers post
poned their attempts.

The correspondent of the Daily
SUPERINTENDENT Of RED CROSS AT MANILA
SUSTAINS REPORT Of THE GOVERNMENT AGENT
Met Him While He Was Investigating the Condition of Affairs in the Philippines, Furnished Him With Data
and Knows That an Official Report Was Recently Made and Filed With
the War Department.
OSWALD H. J. SCHLOTT, who was the superintendent of the Red Cross Society at Man
ila, and who recently returned to this city, made the following statement last night
regarding the Government agent's report on conditions in the Philippines printed in The
Call yesterday:
My official position gave me exceptional opportunities for ascertaining the condition
of affairs in the islands. I traveled for four months visiting all the large islands, having in
my possession a pass from the insurgent government, by whom I was always received with
the utmost courtesy and respect.
In my travels I met the special agent of the Government, whom I know to have had
a pass from President McKinley which entitled him to special consideration from General Otis.
I found him to be a thorough gentleman and know he is of high standing in the United States.
He was entirely unprejudiced in making his investigations, and exercised his best endeav
ors to do justice to the army, the people of the United States, as well as the people in
habiting the archipelago.
I met the gentleman on his routes in the southern provinces of the Philippines, and
a portion of the statement made by him was received through me. He carried on his in
vestigations according to the instructions of the home Government and embodied the result
in the official report recently filed in Washington.
I know the article as published in The Call of Friday morning to be a copy of this offi
cial report made by him to the Assistant Secretary of War.
I do not know where The Call obtained this report, but I do know that such a report
was made and is on file in the War Department."
l Mail further says that the Free
| State forces have completed all
j preparations for the destruction
| of the Bothulie bridge when that
action becomes necessary.
The Prince of Wales has
promised to see General Redvers
Duller and his staff off from the
Waterloo Station to-day. A bis:

AMERICAN CONSULS
WILL NOW PROTECT
BRITISH INTERESTS
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13. â The State
Department was to-day- notified of the
withdrawal from Pretoria of Conyngham
Greene, the British diplomatic agent to
the South African Republic, and the ex
istence of a state of war between Great
Britain and that republic. Mr. Macrum,
the American " Consul at Pretoria, has ac
cordingly been Instructed to undertake
The War Office has received the following dispatch |pom the general com
manding the Cape forces:
"CAPE TOWN, Oct. 13. 1:40 p. m.â An armored train from Mafeking, escort
ing two 7-pounder guns, sent from here to Mafeking, was attacked last night at
Kraaipan. Apparently a rail had been removed. The train left the track and the
Boers fired Into it with artillery for half an hour and captured It. Telegraphic
communication with Mafeking is interrupted at Kraaipan. The women and
children have been sent to Cape Town. The guns belonged to the colony. They
are light and of old pattern. We have no details as to casualties

the exception of the engine driver, were made prisoners by the Boers.
the care of British Interests in that
section during the war.
The notification came to the State De
partment in the shape of a note from Mr.
Tower, In charge of the British Embassy
here. The details of the transfer of Brit
ish interests In case of war had been pre
viously arranged, so that all that was
necessary was the dispatch of a brief
cablegram to Mr. Macrum at Pretoria.
This officer Is the superior in rank to the
other Consular representatives of the
United States, not only in the Transvaal
but In the Orange Free State, and he has
been Instructed to give those officials the
necessary directions. The only other Con
sular officer besiues Mr. Macrum in the
South African Republic is Mr. Gordon,
who succeeded Mr. Manion as Consular
agent at Johannesburg. Mr. Manion hav
ing resigned a few months ago. In the
Orange Free State the United States is
represented by Alfred Elliott, Consular
agent at Bloomfontein. He Is an English
man, and therefore it is questionable
whether he will remain at his post In his
capacity as American agent or retire. In
the latter case Mr. Macrum will probably
select some suitable American to take up
the duties of Consular agent.
There is no present Intention at the
State Department to issue a proclamation
of neutrality. It Is customary to omit
these proclamations ' until . some emer
gency arises calling for their Issue, and
such an emergency Is not expected to oc
cur In South Africa.
BIG INVADING
FORCE FROM
THE FREE STATE
LONDON,' Oct. 14.â Ladysmith cor
respondent of the Times, telegraphing on
Thursday, says: "A subsequent recon
nolsance shows that the invading force
from the Free State numbers approxi
mately 12,000 men."
The Times explains this as evidently re
ferring to a previous telegram which has
not yet reached them.
ONE THOUSAND
CANADIAN TROOPS
FOR SOUTH AFRICA
OTTAWA, Ont., Oct. 13.â a meeting
of the Cabinet to-day a decision was
reached to send 1000 Canadian soldiers to
South Africa as Canada's contribution to
the British force now fighting the Boers.
This is double the number of trocps asked
for by the Imperial Government. At the
conclusion of the Cabinet meeting an of
ficial statement was handed to. the press
by the 'Premier, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, as
follows:
"The Government has decided to send |
1000 men "to South Africa, a very much 1
larger number than any one of the other ;
colonies has sent and larger than the
British Government has suggested. The \
only question in the way of the Govern
ment's acting more speedily in the. mat
ter was as to whether or not Parliament
would have to be called on to meet the
expenditures. This point was got over |
by the form of enlistment, the War Offlce :
having stated that units of men of 125
each should be sent and that they would
be attached to imperial corps. The Cana
dian Government would hayÂ» preferred
to have sent a whole regiment with a Ca
nadian officer in command. Good marks

men will have the preference. The t'-Â»v
ornment will equip the contingent and
pay the cost of transportation to a point
on the South African coast. Enrollment
will commence at once. The troops, will
sail for South Africa before the 30th
inst."
BRITONS BEGIN
TO REALIZE THAT
THE WAR IS ON
LONDON. Oct. 13.-The announcement
that, the Boers had destroyed an armored
train on the western border of the Trans
vaal is. calculated to bring home to "the
man in the street" the realities of war.
Attempts are made to liken the occur
rence to the blowing up of the United
States battleship Maine in Havana har
bor, but that event occurred in times of
peace. The Boers are doubtless within
their rights as belligerents if they are
responsible for the destruction of the
train. '.'="â ' 'v.*. ': xlr-i:". ... .
Apart from : this destruction of the
.. armored, train, the most notable change
| in the position of affairs is the presence of
i Boers at Maribogo, forty miles south of
j Mafeking, which seems to indicate that
they are endeavoring . to get . Colonel
i Baden-Powell between two fires.
. The gravity of the Boer advance can be
better estimated when it is realized that
they will thereby cut railway and tele
graphic communication to the north
isolating several . British positions which
must be speedily relieved.
Despite the optimistic . reports of the
ability of Mafeking to repel attack, the
greatest anxiety prevails here regarding
the situation . there. . as It is known that
the redoubtable commandant, Cronje, who
captured the Jameson raiders, has the
strongest force yet put in the field with
the exception of Commandant General
Joubert's force. Cronje's troops now
number between 9000 and 10,000 men.
The position in Natal has not materially
' altered. The reported inroad of 3000 Boers
by way of Tintwa Pass is probably identi
cal with the inroad of the force reported
yesterday as having crossed Van Reenans
Pass. The Ttntwa column, according to
the last advices, had reached .within twen
ty miles of Ladysmith. On that showing
there ought to be speedy news of fighting.
Ladysmith is at present the Aldershot of
Natal.
A dispatch from Cape Town says that
no doubt -is felt as to the loyalty of
Lerothidi and other native chiefs, and the
Basutos are still well in hand, but the
Resident Commissioner has decided to pa
trol the border in order to prevent raids.

JOUBERT SAYS
BOERS MUST NOT :
ACT LIKE ROBBERS
PRETORIA, Oct. 12 (delayed in trans
mission).âCommandant General Joubert's
command Is now at Volksrust. Several
Cape Colonists have been sworn in as
burghers. Postal communication with the
surrounding colonies has been suspended,
but that between the Transvaal and the
Orange Free ate is maintained. Treas
urer General de Villiers and Mr. Vander
post of the Free State Raad are now here
consulting with the Government. The
Minister of Mines reports that a satis
factory number of mines are being
worked and that the Government will
keep the shafts of abandoned mines free
of water in the interest of shareholders.
It is reported that forty-six cases of
gold valued at $500,000. which were dis
covered In different canteens in Johan
nesburg, have been confiscated oy the
Government,
â¢ Commandant General. Joubert has Is
sued a circular from the chief laager in
consequence of the report that some of
the burghers had misbehaved themselves
on their journey to the borders, plunder
ing a number of -stores. Such offenses,
the commandant general says, will be se
verely punished. "When we are unwil
lingly compelled to cross the boundary
line of our country," says General Jou
bert, "let it not be thought that we are a
band of robbers and with that in view re
main as far as possible from private
dwellings and from places where no ene
emy Is stationed. When food for forage
for the cattle is needed let certain officers
acquire such goods from the owner and
let a receipt be given with promise of
recompense by the Government."
The Volkstein says: Two small repub
lics have entered upon a struggle with a
gigantic power which wishes to crush
them. Conquer or die is the battle cry
of the brave burghers. Thus will .he
question be solved and the republics once
for all will either be freed from provoca
tion'or will have to bend their net ks to
the yokes of British tyranny. England's
might will not decide the issue. That
rests with God alone.
BOER ATTACK EXPECTED
CAPE TOWN. Oct. 12. evening (Delayed
in transmission).â A dispatch from Mafe
king dated 3:22 o'clock this afternoon says
it is officially stated that the enemy will
probably roach this afternoon or to
morrow. Parties will be sent to watt on
all sides, and guns will be posted on the
high ground southeast of the town. It is
likely the enemy will shell the town for
some hours before attempting to take it
by assault. Already the Boers complain.
They want to attend to their crops, and
many are deserting. Meat is scarce, and
dysentery is prevalent. If the garrison
does nothing- it is probable that the Boers
will retire, giving the garrison, in the
mean opportunities' for hitting them
hard. The garrison must seize and utilize
such opportunities.
Information has been received from an
other source that the Boers have actually
crossed the frontier some miles south of
the town. This information is believed to
be correct though it lacks confirmation.
PREMIER SCHREINER'S PLEA.
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 13.â Premier Schrel
ner, on moving the adjournment of the
Cape House of Assembly, made a nota
ble speech, in the course of which he al
luded to the position in which the Cape
Government was placed. He said he
would do the duty Imposed upon him
without favor or fear â the duty of all
to save the colony, so far as possible,
from being involved in the vortex of war.
In his circulars to the military com
manders he had already given his reasons
for hoping that the people would remain
quiet, and he would appeal to the mem
bers of the Legislature to possess their
souls In patience, however dark the days
might be, and wait with quietness and
confidence. To the rress representing both
sides in- would appeal for pity, sympathy,
generosity and charity; and lie wished
to make a similar appeal to the churches
and to the natives of the colony. The time
had not yet arrived for him to say what
part he had played In trying to estab
lish peace in South Africa, That would
come later.
"Let this colony," said the Premier in
conclusion, "be a kind haven during the
storm which has burst upon South Af
rica, and let us all pray for the re-estab
lishment of honorable peace throughout
our beloved country."

Marques, Oct. 13.â An official manifesto
has Just been addressed to Afrikanders
throughout South Africa appealing to
them to resist "the unjust demands of
Great Britain" and accusing Lord Salis
bury. Mr. Chamberlain and Sir Alfred
Milner of treachery. It blames the Queen

Chamberlain's criminal policy," and de
clares "that the clear desire and object
of Great Britain are to deprive the Trans

gold mines of the Rand."
- The manifesto says that "Great Britain
has offered two alternatives five-year
franchise and war"â and then goes on to
say: . . â¢
"A difference between the two Govern
ments of two years on the franchise ques
tion is considered by her Majesty's Gov-*
ernment sufficient justification for an en
deavor to swallow the two republics."
In conclusion it reminds Afrikanders
that "Gcd will assuredly defend the
right."
The manifesto is signed by Mr. Reitz,
Secretary of State. A million copies will
bo printed In Dutch and English.

"Never had any people more time to de

Rhodes laid low and was not recognized.
Hod ho been his capture would have been
easy, as the line was not defended. He be
lieves the strength of the enemy is greatly
exaggerated and that they will not attack
j the intrenchments. The chief cause of
i anxiety Is ignorance of their artillery
j strength.
"I understand," continues . the corre
spondent, "that a flying column is being
organized for the protection of the rail
road between the Orange River and Kim
beriy. Trustworthy information shows
that the Orange Free State has half its

along the extensive western border be

ENGLISHMAN MURDERED
BY FRENCH DETECTIVES
Set Upon Because His Master Had
Incurred the Wrath of Officials
at Dieppe.
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â A special to the
Times from Paris says: A great sensa
tion has been caused here by the murder
of an Englishman named Derrick by a
French detective at Dieppe. Derrick was
so shockingly injured that an unusual sur
gical ration had to be performed upon
him, with the result that gangrene Inter
vened and he died.
Derrick was set upon nt the same time
as his master, a wealthy Englishman
named Captain O'Neill Murphy, who had
incurred trie wrath of Dieppe Casino offi

ANOTHER FIRE IN
THE BUSH STORES
Warehouse No. 3 Destroyed, Bring
ing the Loss Up to a Half
Million.
NEW YORK. Oct. 14.â At 2:30 o'clock
this morning fire broke out in the build
ings of the Bush Independent Stores,
which were partially destroyed by fire
yesterday afternoon. The fire this morn
ing apparently started in building No. 2,
which was separated from No. 3 by a
brick wall two feet in thickness.
No. 3 was totally destroyed yesterday,
and it. is thought at this hour, 2:30 a. m.,
that building No. 2 will also prove a total
loss. Building No. 2 contained about
10.000 bales of cotton valued at from $250,
--000 to $300,000. Three firemen were over
come by smoke, and the fire Is not yet
under control. The officials of the. Bush
Independent Stores estimate that the total
loss in consequence of the fire in both
warehouses will certainly exceed $500,000,
Warehouse No. 1 was destroyed by lire a
few months aero.
MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED.
Body of a Chinaman Found in the
Bay.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 13. -The body of a
Chinese was found floating In the bay
near the railway wharf at Sausalito to
day, by Christian Ock, a longshoreman.
Coroner Eden was ' notified and brought
the remains to this city. A cursory exam
ination showed that death had probably
resulted from a bullet wound under the
left ear, as there was no water in the
lungs, though the body had been In the
bay about two weeks.
This evening a Chinese named Wong
How called at the Morgue in company
with two of his countrymen and identified
the dead man as his partner, Lee Doo
Teong, who he claimed was killed a
week ago last Tuesday by the Jibboom of
a fishing smack knocking him into the
waters of the bay at Point San Pedro.
When questioned about the bullet wound
and absence of water in the lungs, the
Chinese became suspiciously silent. The
inquest will occur to-morrow.
About 200 Chinese live at. Point San Pe
dro, and their fishing camp there has
gained a very hard name. Many men
have disappeared from there and have
never been heard of again, while brawls
and cutting affairs are of common occur
rence. It is a hiding-place for highbind
ers when the police make it too interest
ing for them in San Francisco, and once
ensconced in the camp it is almost impos
sible for the authorities to locate a crim
inal.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TRUCKEE, Oct. 13.â For three days
snow has fallen almost continuously. No
such storm has occurred in October since
IMG. when the Dormer party were snow
bound at Dormer Lake. Ono of Truckee's
principal Interests is the pasturing of
sheep and cattle during the summer
months. All the stock and herds are still
in the mountains, and the greatest con
sternation prevails lest they perish, from
hunger and exposure. Most of the snow
has melted as it fell, but there is one foot
on the ground at Truckee, and from two
to four feet in the surrounding moun
tains. The storm was a complete surprise
and the cattle are scattered all over the
mountains.
Some of the dairymen are hauling hay
| to their stock, but the supply is limited,
| and thousands of cattle and sheep must
perish soon if the storm continues.
LONG BEACH, Oct. 13.-One of the
worst storms that ever visited this re
gion is now raging. There is a howling
south wind and a rough sea. The float
at the end of the pleasure wharf was

Sacramento Valley had a thorough
drenching. Rain fell almost steadily dur
ing the entire night and up to nearly 10
o'clock tins morning. it was one of the
heaviest October storms the valley lias
had in a number of years. Rain was
badly needed, particularly from a sani
tary point of view, as there is considera
ble sickness throughout the valley. Some
grain which was not housed will be dam
aged. There will also be slight damage
to grapes. -

salable. Other varieties of grapes have
been gathered. As yet the rain has been
insufficient to damage hay. In most places

HERO OF THE
WAR ARRESTED
H. B. Ford Recognized
as a Fugitive.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE, Oct, 13â Back from the
Philippines, where he made an enviable
record for bravery, came H. B. Ford of
Company B, Idaho Volunteers. With his
company he was royally welcomed by the
people of his own State. Then Ford came
to Spokane. He was on the streets but
a few hours before he was recognized by
Sheriff Tucker of Yakima County as a
fugitive from justice.
Six years ago Tucker had some trouble
with Ford, who was then a mere boy,
and Ford pulled a revolver and fired five
shots at Tucker. None took effect. Ford
was arrested, tried, convicted and sen
tenced to ten years' imprisonment. He
escaped while his case was being ap
pealed. He assumed the name of Ford,
his right name being William Feamster.
For six years he dodged the officers of
the law. Now he is glad he was recap
tured, for Sheriff Tucker and Judge
Graves, who tried and sentenced Ford,
have labored on his behalf and the Su
perior Court has suspended sentence per
manently. Ford's valor as a soldier has
relieved him from punishment for his
youthful crime. He again bears the name
of Feamster and liberty is his.

REA PROMISES
A SETTLEMENT
Meeting of Union Bank
Stockholders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. There was a lively
meeting of the stockholders of the de- |
funct Union Savings Bank at Turn Verein ,
Hall this morning. For a time it looked j
as though the session might break up .n |
a row. Senator Shortridge and A. Bar
ker got into neated dispute, in which
the words thief and liar were freely used,
but not directly, but ex-Boss Rea wound j
things up in a suave manner, in which he j
eulogized ex-President Ward Wright and
Will H. Wright, saying the former was
an honest and upright man until E. B. I
Howard, the fruit-shipper, had got him
in his clutches. The directors were asked
to levy an assessment of $60 per share
in order to pay the depositors in full.
The meeting of stockholders was culled
by President Rea for the express purpose
of presenting his first semi-annual ac
count of his management of the bank and
to outline a future course of action. On
the stage beside him were Manager Aus
tin and Secretary A. Friant. About two
hundred stockholders and depositors were
present.
After calling the meeting to order Presi
dent Rea read his semi-annual account,
and then made an explanatory statement.
He said when all the assets were real
ized on there would still be a deficiency
of $277,897 61. In order to pay the DOS
itors in full he favored an assessment of
$60 or $70 per share. An assessment of $.0
per share would realize from solvent
stockholders $310,971, and $70 per share
would bring in $373,299. This was with an
allowance that only a little over 50 per
cent of stockholders could be made to
pay the assessment. He stated he had
not received the entire support of the
board of directors in his management, but
Peter Stock had resigned, and he had had
T. B. Caldwell elected a director. With
the aid of the latter and Directors Dun
lop and Simpson he now proposed to pro
ceed to a settlement of the bank's affairs
as speedily as possible. Directors Eaton,
Jones and Callisch had opposed him in
various matters. They had refused to pay
the $10 assessment recently levied on the
stock and were fighting the same, with
a view of postponing its payment until
time had elapsed when further assess
ments could be levied. He promised to
see that all were made to pay the assess
ment, and that depositors should receive
100 cents on the dollar.
One of the stockholders inquired If Rea
did not owe the bank some money. The
president replied that he did owe the bank
$5000, but it was amply secured.
Senator Shortridge then got the floor
and monopolized it pretty much the rest
of the meeting. -In fact he became a
dictator. He said he had. been robbed
both as a depositor and a stockholder.
Shortridge said stockholders who could
and would not pay. the assessment were
thieves. Howard was denounced as a.
thief and the man -responsible for break
ing the bank. He wanted all the stock
holders who refused to pay a $60 assess
ment sued.
It was then developed that shortly be
fore the failure when stockholders kicked
on the management of the bank the pres
ident had a practice of buying their stock.
A motion was made that an assessment
of $60 per share be levied in order to pay
the depositors in full. This passed, about
half a dozen voting in favor of it. A $10
assessment has already been levied.
President Rea stated that in the course
of a couple of weeks he would call a
meeting of the directors for levying such
an assessment.
A motion to appoint a committee of five
to meet a similar committee of depositors
to see if a settlement could not be ef
fected at less than the value of deposits
was lost, Shortridge and half a dozen
friends voting the matter down.
Aside from asking for a $60 assessment,
on which only a few voted, the meeting
was in the nature of a Shortridge-Rea
admiration society, and had the appear
ance of being called for the purpose of
clearing the skirts of the Wrights for all
blame in the wreck of the bank.
The board of directors met this after
noon, but transacted nothing but routine
business. Amat>a Eaton was elected vice
president of the bank.

did not leave their anchorage inside

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FARGO. N. D., Oct. 13.-Over 10.000 per
sons greeted President McKinley and his
party when they arrived here to-night at
7:30. Entering carriages the party was
driven to a reviewing stand through a
line of the First North Dakota Volun
teers, who recently returned from the
Philippines. The President was received
with wild demonstrations. In his address
he referred repeatedly to the situation in
the Philippines. When he declared the
"United States Government would send
60,000 men to the Philippines to uphold the
American flag, where the volunteers had
placed it, the crowd approved the declara
tion with wild applause. The President
said in part:
I have come here especially that I might look
Into the taces of the North Dakota Volunteers,
who saw service ln the battle line in Luzon.
You did your duty and you tilled my heart with
joy when with other volunteers and regulars,
you sent me word that you would not quit the
battle line in Luzon '.11 could create a new
army and send it there. You refused to beat
a re'trert or shirk your colors in the presence
of the enemy. No matter who wanted you to
Â£o home you said. "We will stay and keep^the
tiag stainless in the presence of the enemy."
No soldiers cf any country ever had any more
delicate or trying 'duty. This army, of which
this fragment from your State formed a part,
remained in Luzon waiting, first for the treaty
of peace, which was being perpared in Paris,
then for its ratification by the Senate of the
United States, then until the exchange of
ratification between the Unit States and
Spainâ waiting through all that long period,
accepting the insolence of the insurgents with
dignity, because they were ordered by the ex
ecutive of the nation not to strike a blow pend
ing the treaty of peace, except in defense. They
accepted; therefore, the insolence of the Insur
gents: with a patience sublime.
We never dreamed that the little body of In
surgents whom we have Just emancipated from
Spain would turn upon the flag that had de
livered them from Siialn. Then it was that
the insurgent leader began an attack upon
our men and then our boys let loose. But I
always thought the boys were quite ready for
It. (Applause.; I want to give them the ere lit
of saying here in the presence of their neigh
bors ami friends, their fathers -.'! mothers,
that these boys forebore all things rather than
disobey the order of the Government they were
Eervingr. The leader of the insurgent " forces
lays to the American Government: "You can
have peace if you will give us Independence."
Peace for independence, he says. He had an
other price than that for peace once before,
but the United States ays no gold for peace.
We never gave a hribp for peace in all our
history and we never will. (Applause.)
Ourj flag is there where you left it. you >.'.>Â«

ROBBED NEAR CHICAGO
Five Men Board a Limited Express, Blow Open and
Loot the Safe and Escape Hotly Pursued
by Officers From the City.
Volleys of Bullets Are Sped Toward the Crew, and the Engineer Is
Wounded While Resisting the Demands of the Outlaws That He
Run His Locomotive Away From the Train.
CHICAGO, Oct. 14.â Masked robbers
held up train No. 9 of the Northwestern
Railroad shortly before midnight between
Maple Park and De Kalb and shot at Dan
White, the engineer, and ran away with
and blew open the express car and safe.
When the robbers had rifled the car they
disappeared. '.:';â¢';.; ',
Train No. 9 forms part of the fast trans
continental mail, which was recently es
: tablished between New York and San
j Francisco. The run is made from Chicago
i to Council Bluffs on a schedule exceed
ing a mile a minute. It has been the gen
eral custom to carry only two cars, one
containing express matter and the other
! mail.
Train No. 9 left the Northwestern depot
at 10 o'clock, with Dan White, a veteran
I employe of the road, as engineer. No
! stops were scheduled before De Kalb, at
! which place the train was due shortly
before 11 o'clock. At Maple Park, fifty
miles from Chicago, It was discovered
I that tower "W," at Elburn, was either
out of order or was not giving the right
signal. Dan White closed the throttle
quickly and brought the train to a stand
still.
j The train was midway between Elburn
i and Maple Park. White had hardly
brought his engine to a standstill when
two masked men jumped on the steps and
i pointed guns at him and the fireman.
"Throw up your hands:" they shouted.
1 The railroad men did so.
Two robbers detached the engine from
. the rest of the train and White was told
jto pull out. The robbers ordered him to
i take his engine two miles up the track.
, There he attempted to make a fight and
| recapture his engine. . He struggled man
: fully, but finally one of the robbers shot
at him, but failed to hit him.
In the meantime four other men had
attacked the conductor and the brakeman.

Company's wharf, and will hereafter

give employment to many hands.
SUBTERRANEAN LAKE IN
HEART OF A MOUNTAIN
Discovery Made by a Party of Pros
pectors, in British
Columbia.
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. 13.â discov
ery has been made at Goldstream, within
twenty miles of Victoria, of a large sub
terranean lake in the heart of Mount
Skirt which attains an altitude of 1100
feet above the level of the sea. There are
a number of gold and copper properties
there, all of which promise to be very
rich. The find was made by a party con
sisting of P. H. and Chris Peterson and
A. G. West, all of this city. They had a
partner. W. A. Saunders, who has just
returned from Alaska, and he will leave
by the next steamer for San Francisco
to endeavor to interest capitalists. The
three men were following a rich ledge
of copper ore between fifteen and twenty
feet wide, found by them on the moun
tain. In going about this work they
found a natural shaft sinking at an
angle in the very center of the ledge and
decided to explore It.
About twenty feet from the surface
Peterson found the passage open out Into
a large chamber. Candles were lighted
and the men found that they stood on a
narrow shelving platform of quartz, while
Stretching away as far as they could see
lay a lake which proved to be of fresh
water of icy coldness. The depth of the
water could not be fathomed. Seven or
eight feet above their heads extended a
roof of blackened rock, from which were
suspended Icicle-shaped pendants, lack
ing, however, the brilliancy of stalactites.
interesting as the phenomenon may be
on its own merits it will also be of great
advantage in exploiting the ledge. By
installing a siphon the lake can easily
be emptied, even though of great depth.
This will leave an Immense tunnel, which
will greatly facilitate the work of stoping
and will form an ideal tunnel for explora
tion.

PASADENA. Oct. 13.â Steps have been
taken by the School Trustees of Pasadena
to enforce the State truant law, which re
quires of parents or guardians that chil
dren between the ages of 8 and 14 years

tion by the principals of the seven schools
which will contain the names of all chil
dren in the seven districts who should be

be given to Marshal Lacey, who will no
tify the parents and guardians.
In case the" law is not compiled with
after notice has been served, the Board
of Trustees will prosecute. The penalty
is a maximum fine of $20 for th.. first of
fense and between $20 and (60 for subse
quent offenses, which fines go to the
school funds when collected. There are
at present- ISSO pupils in the schools. More
than 100 truants will be brought In by thÂ«

; them. The conductor was unable to make
i any resistance, as he was told he would
be killed. One of the brakemen managed
: to escape in the darkness, and raced to
; Elburn, where he sent the alarm to the
train dispatcher in Chicago.
The robbers, after overpowering the
; conductor, ordered the express messen-
I ger, Frank Hobson, to admit them to the
I car..
"You open up that car," one of the
robbers shouted, "or we'll blow it up."
Hack from the car came a shout: "You
try to force it open and I'll shoot the
first man who shows his head!"
A volley of shots was the reply, and
after several bullets had whistled past
big head the express messenger opened
the car. The robbers put revolvers to his
head and compelled him to give up the
keys to the local safe. They then blew
open the door of the through safe with
dynamite, the explosion wrecking the car.
The robbers grabbed all the money and
express packages they could and fled. Al
though It is impossible to give with any
great accuracy the amount, it is estimat
ed by the officers of the American Ex
press Company that there was $25,000 in
the safes. This amount was stated early
to-day by General Manager Anrisdel of
the American Express Company to have
been In the car in cash alone. The amount
of jewelry, etc., Mr. Anrisdel . says he
could not state.
The news of the holdup was received in
Chicago before 12 o'clock. Word was sent
at once to the superintendent and a spe
cial train was ordered made up. Messen
gers were dispatched for Detective Reilly,
Chief of the Special Police of the North

When the train dispatcher was notified
he gave orders to freight No. US. bound

ENTHUSIASM RUNS HIGH.
The Nation's Guest Lays the Corner

Name at Norwich
University.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NORTHFIELD, Vt., Oct. Admiral
Dewey to-day laid the cornerstone of
Dewey Mall, which is to be a part of
Norwich University, the institution in
which the admiral received his earliest
military training. I The admiral was es
corted from his train to the university
by the Norwich University cadets and
the First Regiment, Vermont National
Guard. Admiral Dewey spread the mortar
and as the cornerstone was lowered said:
"I now declare this stone duiy and truly
laid, and according to my wish."
Senator-elect Chauncey M. Depew of
New York delivered the address of the
day. At the conclusion of Mr. Depew's
address Admiral Dewey held a reception
for a short time
BOSTON, Oct. 13.â Admiral Dewey and
a small party of friends, Including his
son and Lieutenant Brumby, left North
field, Vt.. at 12:20 o'clock this afternoon
on a special train of two parlor cars.
At every station there was a cheering
crowd and occasionally a Grand Army
post would be drawn up In line. Salutes
were fired with torpedoes or with rifles.
At each station the train was slowed up
so that the people could see the admiral,
who sat at the .windows In .he rear car.
At White River Junction the train was
sent across the river to West Lebanon,
where the train of President Tuttle of
the Boston and Maine road was waiting,
containing besides the president and other
railroad officials Governor Frank W. Rol
lins and other New Hampshire officials,
and representatives of the Governor and
Legislature of Massachusetts. The car
in which the admiral rode was attached
to President Tuttle's train and Governor
Rollins, who was to conduct the admiral
through New Hampshire, was introduced
to his guest. By this time the crowd of
sightseers was cheering and the admiral
stepped upon the rear platform in time
to near the' Dartmouth boys from Han
over give the yell. Then they called far
a speech and the admiral said:
"I can't make a speech."
Just then the train started, the college
boys veiled and the admiral called out:
"That's it. boys; you'll own the country
some day."
As the train ran through New Hamp
shire the enthusiasm increased as the
crowds were larger. Factories along the
track blew their whistles, fire bells were
rung and torpedoes were continually ex
ploding along the track. At all the sta
tions the train ran slowly and the ad
miral and Governor Rollins stood together
on the platform, bowing right and left.
At Concord the crowd was a big one.
The train pulled down to the railroad
shops, where a change of engines was
made. The â¢ new. engine, labeled the
"Olympia," backed up to where the ad
miral could see the front. It bore an im
mense gilt medallion of the admiral on
the boiler head, while under it was a
miniature barbette with long guns and
the inscription, "Stand to your guns and
obey orders."
While the train was in waiting Admiral
Dewey, from the rear platform, was
greeted by several of St. Paul's school
boys and shook bands with several
friends. Then the train continued to
Manchester, reaching there amid a salute
from the First New Hampshire Battery.
Each window in the great Amoskeag cor
poration building facing the railroad had
Its knot of operatives waving cloth or
aprons. As the train passed from New
Hampshire to Massachusetts territory
the Massachusetts representatives went
Into the admiral's car and were Intro
duced by Governor Rollins, who turned
the guest over to the care of Massa
chusetts.
At Lowell the crowd was larger than
any vet seen. From Lowell to Boston it
seemed as if the tracks were lined with
people so continuous was the cheering.
The train pulled Into the union station
in this city at 6:05 p. m., to find there a
terrific jam of humanity. Fully 25,000
persons were crowded ln and around the
station, and in the rush to get a look at
th.- hero he was well nigh carried off his
foet. He was met by Mayor Quincy and
a delegation representing the Homo Mar
ket Club, the Chamber of Commerce and
other municipal bodies. The admiral rode
at the head of a column of 10,000 war
veterans through the city's principal

! officials.
He said at 10:30 o'clock four men had
â  come Into the tower and asked him the
; number of the next train golifc? west. They
wanted to know if it was not No. 9, but
the operator says he told them it was
No. 119
The robbers then told the operator he
i was a fool, that they knew better. To
I show the operator they had laid their
I plans thoroughly and knew what they
i were talking about they pointed guns at
his head and told him if he made a move
they would kill him. They tied him no
with ropes, stuffed a towel in his mouth
and told him if he was a good fellow he
would escape without being hurt. They
then set the signals which caused No. 9
to slow up.
The train dispatcher made repeated ef
forts to reach the Maple Park operator
: when no report was made to him for fif
; teen minutes of the passing of No. 9.
| It was lirst thought at the Northwestern
j office that No. 9 had been wrecked, and
I orders were sent up and down the line to
1 watch out and report an accident If any
had occurred.
The police headquarters in Chicago were
notified of the holdup at midnight. Detec

iof getting some trace of the robbers.
| Lieutenant Williams said there was little

that the practice had been pretty well

robbers.
The stopping of the mail train brings
the United States authorities directly into
tho case as well as the express company

TAMASESE PROCLAIMED
KING OF SAMOA
Natives Choose Their Favorite Ruler
Despite the Late Agreement of the
Treaty Powers.
CHICAGO, Oct. 14.â A special cable to the Chicago Tribune from Berlin says:
News comes frcm Apia that the natives have proclaimed Tamasese as King
despite the recent agreement of the United States, Germany and Great Britain
to abolish that office.
The Cologne Gazette's Apia correspondent sends a long indictment of the
Consular Government. He says the natives do not conceal their disrespect for
the representatives of the treaty powers, relating a singular incident as an illus
tration. Tamasese Invited the officials and the leading white citizens of Apia
to a wedding feast. All went except the Germans.
The American Consul, Mr. Osborne, made a speech, thus giving the affair
official recognition. Thereupon Tamasese's followers danced and sang impromptu
songs proclaiming Tamasese as King and announcing the destruction of the
opposing natives if they resisted his authority.
When the letter was mailed, September 8 hundreds of Tamasese's and Tanu's
followers were gathered at Apia preparing to swear allegiance before the eyes of
the foreign Consuls by presenting gifts and attesting homage. The letter says a
New Zealand lawyer named Gurr is managing the affair.
COUNCIL DELIBERATIONS.
The Democratic Party's Platform Si-
lent on the Labor Question.
The silence of the Democratic party on
the labor question In its platform was
the cause of comment at the meeting of
the Labor Council last night. A dele
gate in speaking of the omission made
the statement that he had noticed that
the Republican party had placed a plank
In its platform favoring labor unions. In
order to be correct on the proposition,
and fearing that the entire platforms of j
the parties had not been carefully printed j
In the dally newspapers, he moved the
following resolution, which was adopted: i
Resolved, That the secretary be instructed to
obtain from the county committees of the vari
ous political parties bearing on municipal tick
ets in the field copies of planks In their plat
forms relating to organized labor and present
said copies to this council as early as prac
ticable.
The boycott on Techau's Tavern has
been extended to cover all parts of the
building. Heretofore it only applied to
the dining room, but now the entire
building has been blanketed. The Musi
clans' Union complained of the Danish
society Daniaand Danish Brotherhood of
Oakland for hiring "scab" music at . its
moonlight picnic which will be held on
the night of October 22. The Carpenters'
Union No. 36 of Oakland were notified of
this fact, several of Its members being
also members of the society.
A communication was received from
Samuel (Jompers, ln which it was stated
thet the Bricklayers' and Masons' appli
cation for affiliation to the A. F. of L.
would not be acted on before the regu
lar annual meeting in January next. He
found fault with the San Francisco trades
unions for not giving the bricklayers'
local union due recognition. This union,
lie said, was affiliated with the interna
tional union, and as such was entitled to
a respectful consideration.
The delegates from the Theatrical
State Employes' Union. W. G. Rusk and
Robert Little, were seated, as was A.
Foertsch from the Milkers' Union.
The Fresco and Paperhangers' organi
zation received its charter from the
Brotherhood of Painters and Decorators
of America, and was duly Installed last
night.
A decision from the Supreme Court of
Michigan indorsing the action of Judge
Mogan to a certain degree was hailed
with much delight. It is as follows:
Laborers have the. right to fix a price upon
their labor and to refuse work unless that
price Is obtained. Singly or In : combination
they have this right. They may present their
cause to the public in newspapers or circulars
in a peaceable way and with no attempt at
coercion. If the effect - of such a case is ruin
to the employer It Is damnum obosque Injuria,
for they have only exercised their legal rights!
At a meeting of the Building Trades
Council last night the plasterers' and
stalrbullders' delegates were admitted to
full membership.
The secretary was Instructed to com
municate with political county commit-
The P' ihppine War.
This contest is proving much more stubborn
than we anticipated. It needs a vigorous con
test to straighten matters out. We should

Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. -.-Information
reaching here to-night from Ortiz. State
of Sonora, Mexico, contains the following
information with reference to the Yaqui
Indian war:
Military scouting parties reaching the
military mobilization point at Torin, this
State, to-day, report that large forces of
Yaqui Indians are being mobilized at the
base of the mountains to the north of
that place, near Sahuripa. It is esti
mated that there are fully 200 Indians
there at present, and additional arrivals
are coming: in all the time. At the pres
ent time the Mexican forces, numbering
some 6000 troops in all. are mobilized in
or near Torin, and it is understood tne
object of their concentration at that point
ls to move into the Yaqui country at an
early date, probably about the middle of
next week, and open up a vigorous war
fare on the Indians, with a view of driv
ing them out and ending the war at once.
This mobilization of Mexican troops has
been conducted as quietly as possible,
with a view of sweeping down on the In
dians while they are still scattered
through the Yaqui country in small
bands, taking them by surprise and
sweeping them off the face of the earth,
orders having been given to take no pris
oners. The scouting parties, however,
state that the Indians have evidently
been informed of the mobilization of
troops, as they are mobilizing their forces
also and are preparing to offer a for
midable resistance in the advancement of
troops.
At present with 2500 men at their dis
posal at Sahuripa, which is considered
the key to the Yaqui country, the In
dians may be able to hold their own
against the troops with even half-way
fortifications. This reported mobilization
of the Indians was received with some
surprise by the Mexican forces, and may
possibly force them to change their plan
of action, but from reliable sources it is
learned that every effort will be made
to push the fight next week In the hope
of bringing it to a speedy termination.

ARTILLERY ARM
BADLY MANAGED
Merritt Criticizes the
Service.
Â»
SYSTEM RADICALLY WRONG
â¦
GENERAL URGES REMEDIAL
LEGISLATION.
â -
Officers at Present Have No Voice in
the Selection of the Ordnance
They Are Compelled
to Use.
S;xÂ»c!ql Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct 13.-The annual
report of Major General Wesley Merritt.
commanding the' Department of the East,
headquarters at Governor's Island, New
York, was made public at the.U nited
States War Department to-day. The re
port is a strong arraignment of the whole
situation in the artillery branch of the
service, being particularly directed
against the, ordnance bureau and inci
dentally the quartermaster's department,
the latter for failure to furnish what
General Merritt considered proper quar
ters at artillery posts.
General Merritt says the system on
which' the artillery is organized Is wrong
in that the artilleryman, who is held re
sponsible for the work he has to do with
his guns, has no voice in the making or
selection of them, this being left entirely
to the ordnance bureau. But he adds that
Bince the engineer department in the
same â¢ independent way furnishes the
artilleryman with his emplacements and
there has been no fault to find with this
portion of the equipment; there must be
something more than the mere system to
blame for the unsatisfactory condition of
affairs. -: . . : :'â¢.''â '.
â¢ Jen-Till Merritt says he resumed com
ma no of that department on January 1
lust, since which time most of the in
fantry and cavalry in the department
have been ordered bo foreign .service,
leaving at present only four troops of
cavalry and three companies of infantry,
He- says he has no specific recommenda
tions to make regarding any one place.
The .[officers a,re known to be Intelligent,
industrious and serious in their efforts
to improve the efficiency of their com
mands, : â¢ '_;'â¢
"That the. coast artillery is not to-day
In -ah efficient condition," General Mer
ritt says, "is due to causes over which
artillery officers have no control; nor can
these impediments be reached by the de
partment commanders. Some require the
action of the Secretary of War and oth
ers can be remedied only by Congress.
The needs of the artillery are most ably
presented in the report of the department
artillery .inspector, to which I invite at
tention. i do not feci called upon to urge
th. specific remedies which he proposes;
but I certainly coincide with the opinion
he expresses that the artillery is in need
of remedial legislation. 1 deem it my
duty to direct attention to the defects on
Which Major Storey treats in detail and
then leave the quesion of how they shall
be removed to the law-making authorities
and their advisors.
"Our cavalry and infantry to-day are
organized on a modern basis, are splen
didly officered and equipped and with ' reg
ular supplies,' of food.. clothing and ammu
nition ..â '.main within themselves the ele
ments of complete efficiency. This is not
true of the artillery. The officers are well
educated md zealous, but their efforts
are crumped by Imperfect organization,
and responsibility . for the efficiency or
inefficieey. of their arm li. not as it
should, with themselves, but very largely
ln other quarters. Lather through defects
of law or their own inefficiency the sup
ply departments upon which the artillery
Ie wholly dependent has frequently failed
to loyally st rye its interests. The tact
that the engineer department, working
under the same law. has under its pres
ent chief given the artillery no cause for
complaint would seem to indicate' that
something is wrong besides the law.
"This condition gives rise to the oft
expressed desire of the' artillery "for a
chief of that arm of the service, who
would see that ii is supplied with what it
needs to be effective, but 1. personally
have grave doubts as to this being the
most suitable remedy, as it may result in
adding another bureau to the War De
partment, which may be as difficult to
make i ffli
'1 desire, li addition, to call special at
tention to th- following points in the re
port of the tiller. inspector:
"1. The failure of the quartermaster's
department to niak.- timely provision for
housing tbe garrisons at new artillery
posts.
"2. The necessity for providing at artil
lery posts a permanent post non-com
missioned staff of specialists, electrician
and observer sergeants.
"3. The recommendation that the
strength of the coast artillery be fixed at
the Dumber uf men and officers required
to fully mat! the suns.
"It is observe that the artillery should
he inspected by 'In- artillery officers and
11..;- fact that the department command
er --â¢ artillery inspector has no power to
inspect is a patent absurdity and one
which I urge may be disposed of at an
early date. The means of making any
arm of th" service all it should be should
rest with the peneral commanding the
geographical department In which the
eaid arm of the service is stationed "

OLD MINER RESCUED
BY THE DE VRIES PARTY
Captain Beck Found Unconscfipus
From Cold at Basalt
Meadows.
STOCKTON, Oct. Congressman May
rion de Vries and party, which left here 1
a week ago with the intention of making J
an extensive trip through the yosemite
Valley, has returned. De Vrles says win- \
ter has already come on with unusual
severity, and a trip over the trails was
impossible. Snow has already fallen as
far down as Fresno Flats, a condition not ;
known for years. All the Indians are
collecting and coming down from the]
higher altitudes. i The only, way to get in
now ls from the Inyo side, and if the'
I id weather continues this will be closed
before many days.
While at Basalt Meadows De Vries and
hi? companions picked up Captain Beck,
a well known mining man. The old man
had been In the higher altitudes on a j
prospecting trip. He started to come down
when the storm overtook him. Had he |
not struck the camp of the Congressman !
at Basalt Meadows he would surely have j
perished. When first discovered he was
In an unconscious condition. All the re- '
sources at hand were supplied him, but |
he- mained In a stupor and would not ,
awake from it. The question then was to |
get him out. Captain Beck was lashed j
to one of the horses with ropes and the :
way was made out slowly. It was still
bitterly cold, and Captain Beck did not |
revive during the whole trip. At last j
Fresno Plats was reached again, and !
there the old man was ensconced in the j
hotel and given all possible care. Just j
before the Stockton party left he had re- |
gained consciousness and seemed on a i
fair road to recovery. ;

MARIN LAWS BAR ANGLERS
The large body of anglers from this city
who have fished annually for steelheads
at the White House, Point Reyes, and at

an ordinance in June last which prohibits
the taking of steelheads in any manner in
the streams under their jurisdiction. The
section of the ordinance covering this
matter reads as follows:
Any person who, In the County of Marin,
State of California, between the fifteenth
day of Octeber and the first day of April
in the following year shall catch, kill or de-
stroy any "salmon trout. ' "mountain
trout," "brook trout," "rainbow trout."
"speckled trout," or any other variety of
trout. Any person who shall, at any time,
catch, kill or destroy, with an; seine or net
or any spear, weir fence, banket, trap, grill
net, set net, dynamite or any poisonous,
deleterious or stupefying drug or other sub
stance or other Implement or appliance, any
trout named in this ordinance, or any spe
cies of trout in any of the streams, lakes or
waters lying within the count of Marin,
State of California, shall be guilty of a mis
demeanor. Provided, however, that any
person or persons may anide or catch trout
with hook and line between the ilrst day of
April and the fifteenth day of October ii.
each year.
John Butler has returned from Eel
River after a month's stay there. He
ha - nothing but good words for Humboldt
County and for its people. He was not
there for the best of the fishing, but nev
ertheless enjoyed good sport, On the day
before leaving for home he caught sev
enty-three half-pound steelheads.
Frank Maskey and wife and Fred Lees

stopped. Roadrunner, after running in
second position for two-thirds of the
route, was downed for the place by Finne
gan. The latter horse was plainly the
best, but a bungling ride deprived him of
the honors.
In the other events decided favorites
captured two and second choices two of
the purses. The attendance was good and
the betting better than on the day pre
vious.
Burns & Waterhouse sent Essence, a
half-sister to Heartsease and Normandio,
to the post in the opening scramble for
maiden two-year-olds. The filly was
played down in the ring from 8 to 5 to
even money and won all the way. Moun
taineer, the mount of Bozeman, second
throughout the running, led Miss Vera out
two lengths for the place.
Trainer "Tommy" Lottridge and his
partner, "Jack" Atkin, missed winning a
four-handed jackpot with the long
striding Faversham in the mile run fol
lowing. The select coin was sent in on
Lothian, making that horse an even
money choice. Somis and Correct were
in slight demand. There was apparently
plenty of bottom to the course, and the
mud dressing distressed Faversham not
the least. Ruiz had the. black horse un
der wraps from the start, and he won
snickering from the favorite. The latter
was fortunate indeed to get the place,
for had Fauntleroy on Correct worn his
mud lamps the latter would have been
second. , : Â
Dr. Rowell's colors were seen In the
front for the first time at the meeting In
the seven furlong run, with but four
horses starting. Imperious, a 4 to 5 fa
vorite, with Jones up, spreadeagled his
company, winning ease,; up from Sor
row. Reolia, second choice, was away
from the barrier poorly, never being
able to get near the front.
Nine sprinters started in the final
five furlong dash, with Ftta II opening
a pronounced 6 to 5 favorite. The odds
against the chestnut mare receded to 5 to
2 Lily, and many no doubt were in
clined to think there was "nothing do
ing." Duffy had the leg up. and, trail
ins in fourth position to the stret<-b,
there made his move, and at the wire
downed Bamboulia, the post favorite,
without an effort. Campus took the
show from February.

OLYMPIC PUGILIST
BEAT PHILADELPHIAN
OAKLAND. Oct. 13.-Pete Raconi of
the Olympic Club took exactly three min
utes to-night to defeat Billy Springfield
of Philadelphia at the Reliance Club. The
gong sounded just as Springfield was de
clared out. The round was perhaps the
liveliest ever seen at the Reliance. Both
men were in good condition, and have
records for science. One minute was spent
In walking around each other, and then
the work began. Some hard blows were
struck by both men. when suddenly Ra
coni turned himself loose. He flew' after '
his man. and before Springfield realized ;
the rapidity with which Raconi was fight- I
ing the work was done. Springfield went <
down once, but only remained about six ;
seconds. There was a repetition' of light- j
ning fighting, and just as Springfield was
counted out the gong rang and the de- â¢
feated man was assisted to his comer.
Jack McMahon and W. Mever, both
from San Francisco, were matched for
ten rounds, but in the sixth Meyer was
knocked out. He was outclassed from the ;
start.
Charles Viekers and Mike Moliss went |
ten rounds, and though both knew very
little about boxing they put up a very ac- ]
ceptable hippodroming act and furnished
good entertainment to the crowd. Some
of the rounds were so exciting that they
brought the audience to its feet- veiling
applause to the tired hut game fighters.
Viekers earned the decision.
The programme was one of the best
seen at a local club for many months.
KENNEDY AND CHILDS DRAW.
Six Hot Rounds Fought Before a
Chicago Athletic CluB!
CHICAGO, Oct.. 13.â Kennedy of
California and Frank Childs of Chicago
fought six hot rounds to-night, the de
cision being a draw. Kennedy, who out
weighed Childs. had the better of his an
tagonist a majority of- the rounds, but
Childs did most of the leading through
out. Kennedy had the better of It the
third round, his left ja_s leaving Childs
somewhat unsteady. Kennedy put it all
over Childs in the first half of the fourth
round, landing left jabs and right swings
until Childs was weak. The latter came
up strong at the finish of the round, how
ever, and Kennedy was himself a little
unsteady when the bell rang. The decision
was well received.
McPARTLAND WINS.
NEW YORK, Oct. Liâ To-night Kid
McPartland of this city received the de
cision over Owen Zeigler of Philadelphia
after twenty-five rounds of hard and fast
fighting at the Broadway Athletic Club.
Both men were badly battered and would
not have been able to go two more
rounds. The attendance was 3500. The
Kid had the better of the argument from
first to last, except in the fifth and six
teenth rounds. In the . seventeenth Zeig
ler went to the floor from a right on the
jaw, but arope immediately. They fought
hard to the end. _ Â»- .

WHITE WINGS

SNUGLY FOLDED
Closing Days of the Yachting
Season Are Close at
Hand.
The Victory of the Gadder has produced
one excellent result for the San Francisco
Yacht Club, no fewer than twenty-one
persons, four or five of whom are ladies,
having handed in their names for mem
bership since September 23. Though th*
Corinthians were naturally disappointed
at the defeat of the Truant they bore the
misfortune like true sportsmen. The
change of possession of the Challenge cup
will be a good tiling for yachting and will
aid materially in building up the San Fran
cisco Club. It will also add greatly to the
Interest' of the yachting season of 1900,
for the Corinthians will try their hardest
to recover the trophy, and the Gadder will
make a strong bid for next year's Mac
donough cup.
Last Sunday evening there was a warm
north wind j which induced most of the
yachtsmen at Sausalito to breakfast
ashore. At Ba. m. the clubhouse gun was
fired, and. the officers' flags and burgees
were run up to the masthead. Several of
the Corinthian and California yachtsmen
who had come over for the presentation
of the cup on the previous night paid calls
on Commodore T. 1.. Mill on board the flag
ship gnus. Toward 11 o'clock the fleet
got under way at a signal from Commo
dore T. L. Hill. Commodore Allen M.
Clay saluted and bade his hosts farewell,
then set his course for Oakland Creek.
Off Goat Island the breeze fell light, but
the California yachts Pactolus, Embla,
Idler and Surf after some delay made
their moorings. The San Francisco and
Corinthian yachts moved up to Paradise
Cove and dropped anchor there. The
schooners Ramona, Chispa and Lurline,
the yawls :Tramontana and Arcturus and
the sloops Cygnus, Aeolus. Thelma, Phoe
nicia, Freda, Nixie and Presto were under
way last Sunday.
G. T. S White, ex-vice commodore of
the San Francisco Yacht Club, has sold
the sloop Will o' the Wisp, with all -her
equipment, and for the first time In sev
eral years owns no boat of any sort.
This afternoon the Tiburon fleet will
cruise to Corinthian Cove, and to-night a
chowder supper, prepared under the direc
tion of Port Captain John H. Keefe, will
be served on the beach. To-morrow the
small-yacht regatta and rowooat races
postponed from September 17 are sched
uled to take place. As the yawl Kitti
wake and the sloop Doris are the only
half-raters available the small-yacht re
gatta will probably fall through. There
may, however, be some rowing races, and
there will certainly be a baseball game
between th" "Keegans" and the "Fan
cies," the former captained by "Keegan"
Schober and the latter by "Fancy"
Thornton. Of the last four annual base
ball games each .nine has won two. The
Corinthians will give a closing jinks next
Saturday, the. 21st Inst., at the clubhouse,
but the reception which has in some for
mer years bet given in the afternoon will
be abandoned. The Encinals and San
Franciscos will close on the same day.
On Sunday, the 22d. the last cruises in
squadron will lie taKen.
The handsome schooner yacht Jessie,
formerly owned by J. M. Macdonough and
Bold some time ago to be used as a pilot
boat on the Columbia River, is. to be em
ployed in halibut fishing on the banks off
Cape Flattery and Cape Fox.
The South Bay Club has postponed its
regatta till the. spring of 1900 on account
of the prevailing light winds. The yachts
men around Alviso are having great sport
spearing the leopard sharks which come
up to. the. shore after the crabs. A. C.
Eaton of the sloop Feu Collet recently
speared several which were about four
feet long and weighed fifty pounds each.
The sharks destroy many small fish.
Commodore 11. A. Spencer's schooner
Muriel is being repainted.
HOMING PIGEONS' FLIGHT.
The California Homing Pigeon Club's
second .race for .the southern series for
young birds was flown last Sunday from
Tres Pinos. It again fell to one of John
Filmer's. birds to make the fastest time.
The last race of the series will be held on
November 5. The best average time in
three racs will determine the ownership
of the trophy, a valuable silver cup. The
last race was a severe test on the birds,
owing to the extreme heat. The represen
tatives of the various owners finished in
the following order:
John Filmer's arrived 11:46% a. m.: dis

BASS FOR EEL RIVER.
Fish Commissioners to Stock the
Waters of Humboldt County.
Deputies Fish Commissioners Davis and
Cross were in San Pablo Bay yesterday
seining for small striped bass, which the
Commissioners are to send to Bel River,
Humboldt County, on next Monday. It is
the desire to plant at least .no fry in that
stream. The first lot sent was not a cus
cess; all but a dozen dying en route. The
Commissioners, have been puzzled over
the fact that the -fish have not sought
those waters of their own accord. Soon
after these fish became plentiful in the
waters, of San Francisco Bay the Com
missioners found that the overflow had
migrated. to the south until now they are
plentiful in all of the southern streams
having a' permanent opening into the
ocean. ..",..-. .'â¢* '"-â¢â¢
To; the north it has been different, none
of these fish having been found north of
Cape Mendocino; One theory is that upon
that headland, which is the farthest west
in this State, they came in contact with a
I cold current and- turned hack in search of
warmer waters. It Is believed that if they
once got around the. cape they would have
done well in the more northern bays and
big- streams,, which seem particularly
adapted to their requirements.

THOSE WHO WILL BE AIDS

RAIN MAKES THE CAMPS UN
COMFORTABLE.
IThe Luckless Thirty-First Will Be
Released From Quarantine, but
Not From Its Island
Isolation.
Although General Shafter has not re
ceived official information of the fact,
still there is every reason to believe he
will remain in the service as a volunteer
officer, or an officer of volunteers, after
his retirement as a brigadier general in
the regular army. Monday next he must
retire, but before that time he will hear
from Washington regarding any service
to follow.
Dispatches from the East carry the in
formation that the President intends to
retire him finally as a major general of
regulars, or even a lieutenant general;
but such a thing Is impossible. He must
retire from the regular army on Mon
day, and he cannot be appointed to any
higher rank than that of brigadier, as
there is no vacancy above him, and there
will be no vacancy by the time of his
retirement. After he has been retired he
cannot be appointed to any position
higher or lowerâ in the regular army. It
may be possible, however, to advance him
to be a lieutenant general of volunteers,
but such a course has no precedent and
is not likely to be adopt" d.
If General Shafter remains in the ser
vice after Monday it will bring good for
tune to Captaitt J. D. Leitch, recently
promoted into the Twenty-fifth Infantry,
lie is spoken of as one of | !<..â¢ aids to
General Shafter. and In that case Cap
tain Leitch will be retained on this coast
and in this department. Captain Kit
tredge. General Shaffer's son-in-law. will
be the second aid. and First Lieutenant
Wilson of the Third Artillery is to re
main in his present position.
Captain Kittredge was a captain and
assistant adjutant general on General
Shafter"s staff during the Cuban cam
paign, but soon after the return of the
general i.i was mustered out. Since the
recruiting of the new regiments he has
been mentioned fo,r a commission as .â .
line officer, and a few days ago he was
recommissioned, this time as a captain
ln the Forty-sixth Infantry. He was Im
mediately mad.- an aid to General Shaf
ter. Should General Shafter remain Cap
tain Kittredge will have a much sought
for position, but if the general be retired
as well from the volunteers as from the
regulars Captain Kittredge will have to
join his regiment.
The plan of recruiting a battalk n of the
Fortieth and one of the Forty-third at
the Presidio has been abandoned and the
present intention is to recruit but two
companies of each. A few days ago eight
of the officers destined for the battalion
of the Fortieth being formed here were
ordered East to Fort Riley, where the
regime .(quarters have been estab
lished, and ere were left only sufficient
officers for two companies with Major
Case, who will command the battalion, in
charge. 8
The rain made the volunteer ran at
the Presidio particularly uncomfortable,
but the returning volunteers have had
all kinds of tropical rain poured down
upon them and they do not mind the
showers that fall here. They had to
stand the Islam! weather without the
shelter of tents, too. so they suffered but
little at home. The volunteers on their
way to the islands had not so much ex
perience, however, and except those who
saw service in Cuba they had a bail time
of it. The surgeons' reports from all the
exposed commands show no evil effects
however, be the rain on the whole has
done the men no harm. It has left mud
and to spar* all around the post, but that
is about air it has done.
The two cases of sickness, supposed to
be diphtheria, sent to the genera hos
pital from the Twenty-eighth Regiment
have turned out to be only severe cases
of tonsilltis. No others have been re
ported.
To-day the Thirty-first Regiment will
emerge from quarantine, but that will
bring small consolation to the men of the
command. The regiment will not be
taken from Angel Island, but it will wait
there for transportation to Manila.
There will be a transport assigned to the
command as soon as possible, but it may
be some days before the boys will get
away, and in the meantime they will re
main in isolation unless Colonel Pettlt
Ie generous In the way of passes.
John A. Logan, private In Troop I. of
the Fourth Cavalry, who died at the gen
eral hospital last Wednesday, was buried

Pioneer Farmer Dies.
PETALUMA, Oct. 13.â William McDer

ELLERT OBJECTED TO
FOREIGN SCAVENGERS
'TIS SAID THAT'S WHY HE
RESIGNED HIS POSITION.
Others Say the Italians Objected to
Eliert, but the Ex-Mayor Has
the Papers.
The recently announced resignation of ;
ex-Mayor L. K. Eliert from the manage- j
ment of the Sanitary Reduction Company
has created more discussion "on the j
street" and in political circles than any j
recent occurrence in finance. A. dozen ru- j
mors are in the air as to his reason for
stepping out, and all of them put the
Italian members of the company and their
objection to Ellert's administration be- I
hind It.
That a crisis in the affairs of the as- ,
sociation was approaching has been ap- ;
parent for the past six months. During
that time Mr. Ellert's greatest endeav
ors have been directed to keeping peace
with the Italian scavengers and their fel
low-countrymen and sympathizers among
the stockholders who assumed Ellert's ;
policy as personal slight upon them- ;
selves. , .
Knowing this, the wise ones along the I
street were prone to believe the rumor j
that the Italian members had finally got j
the upper hand and demanded the resigna
tion of the objectionable manager. How ;
they got control of the company stock
was a question no one could answer, but
It was generally said that A. Sbarboro, :
the secretary, had been gradually buying
up holdings here and there, until he had
secured enough to swing things his way.
Sbarboro, It was Bald, was acting as i
agent for the Italian element. Mr. Eliert j
yesterday denied that any of these theo
ries were true and also that his resigna
tion was anything but voluntary. In, sup
port of his statement he displayed a con
tract with the company which did not
expire until 1903. "The fact of the matter
is," said he, "that I have resigned solely
for the reason that my work was becom
ing decidedly distasteful to me. The last ,
few months it has got so that all my ;
time has been taken up in petty fights I
and the settlement of small differences
with a lot of scavengers, and I got sick
Of it. My contract with the company did
not expire until 1903. bo that the story
about an enforced resignation is palpably
untrue. I am still the largest stockholder
In the company, and my interest in Its \
business will be as great as heretofore. j
I have simply unshouldered responsi- 'â 
bility."
TO SHOOT OVER SUTRO'S.
Work Begins on Fortifications Back
of the City Cemetery.
Next week the Government's construct
ors, of fortifications will begin work on i
one of the largest pieces of defensive en
gineering to be placed at any port on the I
coast. The project has long been under
consideration and now the plans are j all
prepared for the "workmen to begin. ' It
is the construction of huge works of
masonry, '-earth, sand and rock for the In
stallment of some of the largest g<jns
that, have ever come to this State on the
high hills between Sutro's and the old
City Cemetery. The fortifications when
complete will be the best at this port,
as the guns will command a full sweep
of the ocean for miles along the coast.
They would be particularly destructive
to a hostile fleet endeavoring to enter the
bay.
About the time of the war with Spain,
it was proposed to rush the work, as the*
Dons had a considerable fleet on the Wa
ters of the Pacific. On May 1 a year ago
Dewey nut the ships of Spain under
water, where they would he safe so far
as this coast was concerned and tho
Government had the work stopped as un
necessary at the time. However, it was I
not dropped and, as stated, work is to be '
resumed next week. All of the lorce of j
workmen, which Is Indeed large, has been
engaged and will begin on Monday.- It is
calculated that it will take at least three |
years to get the fortifications ready for
the Installment of the big guns.

MITCHELL FIRED IN
HIS OWN DEFENSE
VERDICT IN THE McAUEIFFE
INQUEST.
Captain Gilien Testifies Strongly in
Favor of the Prisoner That He
Was Bleeding From ooe's
Fist.
The McAuliffe inquest was concluded
yesterday with the testimony of Police
Captain Gilien and at its conclusion the
jury returned a verdict to the effect that
the deceased, Frank McAuliffe, met his
death from the effects of a gunshot
wound inflicted by Frank Mitchell in self
defense and that the homicide was justi
fiable.
Captain Gillen's testimony was favora
ble to the prisoner. At the time of his ar
rest Mitchell was bleeding at the nose and
mouth and was considerably under, the
Influence of liquor. He told the witness
that while he and the two McAuliffes
were drinking together in the saloon he
remarked to Joe McAuliffe, "Joe. you are
now in a good position and able to pay
me that little bill." McAuliffe asked how
large the bill was and upon Mitchell re
plying called Mitchell an opprobrious
name and said that he would never pay
him. McAuliffe followed up the Insult
ing language with a blow in the mouth,
knocking Mitchell down.. Mitchell went
back to 'lis- grocery and got his revolver
and returned to the place where the Mc-
Auliffes were. The dispute recommenced
and when both brothers were- advancing
upon Mitchell with the apparent purpose
of attacking him he tired and fdiot Frank
McAuliffe. : ; ;

DESERTER LELAND HAS
A TALE OF ADVENTURE
TOOK MALARIA ON THE EVE
OF A BATTLE.
Captured by the Confederates, Es
caped and Assumed the Name
of a Dead Comrade for a
Pension.
William Leland, the ex-soldier arrested
last Thursday at the Soldiers' Home at
Yountville, Napa County, by United
States Marshal Shine on a warrant from
Augusta, Me., charging him with having
falsely sworn to a pension claim, was
taken. before United States Commissioner
Heacock yesterday and ordered sent to
Maine for trial.
Leland is past 60 years of age, and tells
an interesting story. He freely admits I
his guilt, but urges in his defense that he ;
was sorely tempted by reason of his pov
erty and sickness to provide for himself I
by means of a pension to which he was j
not entitled, and that he yielded to the |
temptation. He says that he enlisted in '<
the Thirteenth New York Regiment at
the breaking out of the Civil War and I
served under Burnside at the time of the !
first battle of Fredericksburg. On the :
night of that engagement he was at
tacked with malaria, and while under the
influence of a high fever he stole away
from camp to get a drink of water. He :
was captured by a Confederate outpost i
and placed in the hospital at Danville i
and made his escape eight months after- !
ward. He then went into West Virginia
and surrendered to the first Union pro
vost marshal that he found. There he
discovered that his regiment had been
mustered out and that he had been listed
as a deserter, so that he would be de
barred from going into a soldiers' home or
getting a pension.
He went to Chelsea, Me., about two
years ago and took the name of a com
rade of his company in the Thirteenth
Regiment. This comrade and his wife
had died at Rochester, X. V"., and Leland
thought that if he received a pension in
the name of the dead man no one would
be Injured thereby and that the Govern
ment was rich enough to stand it. Two
acquaintances who had known him only
under the assumed name swore to his
application with him and it .was sent to
the Pension Commissioners, who discov
ered the fraud.
Edmond Godchaux Resigns
Chief Deputy Assessor Edmond God
chaux resigned from his position yester
day afternoon. Assessor Dodge accepted
the resignation, but stated that he will
not fill the vacancy. Mr. .Godchaux has
been nominated for Recorder on the Dem
ocratic ticket, and decided that he could
not fill his official duties and manage his
campaign at the same time.

During the session the committee on
home, which was appointed in .889, will j
probably make its final report and be per- j
mitted to retire with honors well earned
and worthily bestowed, /he following
facts not generally known concerning the I
pioneer order for ladies in this State will j
appear in the report:
1 The ritualistic work of the Adoptive Rite of j
I Eastern Star, as it was originally styled, was
written by the founder. Robert Morris, in Feb
ruary, 1850. For several years, at private gath
-1 erings .of Masons and their female relatives, he ;
I communicated the Eastern Star degree to those j
' present and during his lectures before Masonic :
I lodges he spread the "glad tidings." Still his j
I efforts to systematize the work were very un
satisfactory to him, and it was not until Rob
ert Macoy. in 1868. proposed the plan of East- |
crn Star chapters, now in vogue, that Mr Mor- I
ris felt that at last his labor of love was :
crowned with success.
Alpha Chapter No. 1 of New Tork City was
the first one organized and instituted under the :
perfected Macoy system, and it was the direct j
result of a Masonic fair, which was opened on
, the sth of December, 1566, in the French church
j at Grand and Crosby streets, in aid of the Ma-
I sonic Hall and asylum fund. It lasted for
weeks, proved a great success and netted about
$60,000. The Masons fully appreciating the act-
I ive part the ladies had taken in the fair, and
anxious to keep alive their mutual interests,
proposed organizing a permanent society to be
composed of the. ladles who had assisted at
the fair, most of them having possession of
the Eastern Star degree. In view of this, J.
F. Waring, past master of Enterprise Lodge
No. 228, F. and A. M., at the request of many
members of the Masonic fraternity, on the 17th
of January, 1867, called for a meeting of the
ladies connected with the fair, in Odd Fellows'
building, on the 21st of the month, to organize
a society of the Sisters of the Eastern Star.
The society was organized, and from the date
of its organization the . members took a most
active part in all Masonic work, particularly
in reference to the hall and asylum fund. In
March following the organization the members
gave a reception in aid of the fund, which
netted a neat sum, and in order to make the
amount an even $1000 the society voted $27 out
of its treasury. For a time the members held
house to house meetings, but in time rented a
'hall at 694 Broadway, where, on the Sth of Oc
tober, 1868, Robert Macoy for the first time
used his revised ritual in manuscript form,
before a large audience composed of Masons
and Sisters of the Eastern Star, and exempli
fied what Is. now popularly known as the Order
of the Eastern Star. Soon after, December 28,
1868, Alpha Chapter No. 1 was instituted and
the officers Installed by Macoy. grand patron.
Then followed Friendship Family No. 103 of
Brooklyn, chartered by Morris In IS6fi, which
received a charter from Macoy" ln 1569. and took
the name of Esther Chapter No. 2. Since then
the order has spread in every direction, until
now there are thirty grand chapters In as many
States of the Union. Golden Gate Chapter No.
1 of California was chartered under the Macoy
system on the 10th of May. 1569, and the order
in this State has been in a most flourishing
condition for more than thirty years. Its mem
bership at this time ls about 11.000.
â As a conclusion "H. A. H." has the fol
lowing: "The 'Sisters of the Eastern
Star' who stand to-day in their pride and
strength should pause 'lest they forget*
that they are indebted to a Master Ma
son and Masonic brothers for the concep
tion and adaptation of the beautiful star
'whose light they follow.;' to p. Mason)
and his Masonic brethren for its success- i
ful introduction on this far off Western
shrine; for its establishment here on a i
firm financial basis and also to the Ma
sons for instruction, not only in ritual
istic work, but in parliamentary .aw, and
finally that the whole of the Eastern Star
structure is not only built upon a foun
dation laid by Master Masons, but that
the order connot itself exist without the
support of the Masonic fraternity. Al
though the 'sisters' owe a debt cf grati
tude which they can never cancel and
stand alone, it is still their privilege to
show that they, are in earnest when they
ask to labor at the same shrine. 'Look
ing backward.' who can say that it is not
the mission of the 'Sisters of the Eastern
Star' to make the Masonic Widows' and
Orphans' Home at Decoto the broadest
and the grandest home in the United
States and that it is not their duty to
live and labor for the progress, prosperity
and perfection of the principles embodied
| In the silent teachings of Free Masonry."
| On Monday night there will be a recep
| tion by the local chapters to the delegates
ho will attend the grand chapter.

SAN FRANCISCO'S OPPORTUNITY.
REPORTS from Chicago announce that Marcus
A. Hanna intends to issue a call for the Re
publican National Committee to meet in Wash
ington City early in December, and that it is believed
the committee will then select the place at which fo
hold .the Presidential convention next year. To the
report is added the statement that the cities most
frequently spoken of as suitable places for the con
vention are St. Louis, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Mil
waukee/Minneapolis and San Francisco.
It will be seen that Eastern people have begun
to consider San Francisco's fitness as a meeting
place for national conventions without any particular
urging on our part. California is no longer regarded
as a remote section of the Union too distant to be
conveniently visited. The improvement of railway
facilities and telegraph communication, the success
of the numerous national' gatherings of various as
sociations held here, and last, but not least, the im
pression made upon the country at large by the man
ner in which the city has received the volunteers
both when going to the Philippines and when re
turning home, have had an educational effect upon
the Eastern mind. San Francisco from this time
forth will be looked upon always as one of the great
convention cities of the nation and its claims will be
carefully considered by those who are to decide
where conventions are to be held.
These facts give encouragement to the movement
now started to bring to San Francisco at least one,
and possibly both, of the national Presidential con
ventions of next year. There was never before so
good an opportunity for carrying such a movement to
success as at this time. It is not likely there will be
much of a contest over the nominations in either
party, and consequently the advocates of different
leaders will not have to consider the advantage of
holding the convention in a city favorable to their
candidate. The personal factor is eliminated, and a
city whose population is impartial, like San Fran
cisco, has a better chance to win than it would have
were there any question of individual favoritism at
issue.
The many advantages of this city as a place for
summer conventions are well known to our own peo
ple and are beginning to be understood elsewhere.
In no other large city in the United States is there
such pleasant and healthful weather in the summer
as that which prevails here. Delegates to a conven
tion to San Francisco in June need have no fear of
prostration from heat, or sunstrokes, or other ill
effects of the heated season in the East.
Furthermore, our hotel accommodation has now
been amply proven to be sufficient to meet all the
demands that will be made upon it by the largest con
vention that is likely to assemble. The trip across
the continent is now a pleasure tour rather than a
fatiguing journey, and can be undertaken without
serious inconvenience to any one.
All of these things it wall be easy to impress upon
the national committees of the two great parties if
we set about it rightly. That is now the issue before
our citizens. It is one that must be attended to
without delay. Statements made in interviews with
representatives of The Call and published yesterday
and this morning show that strong, and influential
men are willing to support the movement with energy
and zeal. The prospect of success is therefore good.
Let all unite and make San Francisco the convention
city of the nation in 1900.
At this stage of the game it might be well to point
out to the Associated Press that what the country
wants from the Transvaal is news and not editorial
comment with a strong British bias. So far that
is about all it has been transmitting.
Edmond Godchaux, Democratic candidate for Re
corder, has jarred the belief of many of the faithful
by resigning as chief deputy to Assessor Dodge.
No Democrat was ever known to do anything of the
kind.
Francisco Morosco, a Sutter Creek laborer, had
a theory that he could smoke with safety in the im
mediate vicinity of blasting powder. He* tried it,
and it is' needless to say that the theory exploded.
â¦
If Germany, France, Russia or any other power
has a bone to pick with Great Britain now is the
time to do it.
IF THE RAIN WERE STORED!
THE rains have fallen timely and over much of
the ground in sufficient volume to enable the
plowing of ground, in preparation for seeding.
In the Eastern States, where the land is locked by
deep frost, the farmer waits for winter to break and
the ground to thaw, and then seedtime is upon him.
Here the farmer waits for summer to break and the
ground to be moistened by the early rains and then
goes afield with his plow.
The summer has broken ; the soil is moistened
and will soon be turned. Ahead is the prospect of a
rainy season of unusual length and fall. The rain on
the plains and foothills and the snow in the moun
tains will be abundant, and many will forget the
time of lack and the fallow fields and withered
orchards that it caused.
There are many, however, who, remembering the
drought and knowing the certainty that such years
will come again, will persist in measures that will
avert their consequences and make every year fruit
ful.
" To these men the promise of abundant rain in the
coming season is a promise of drought averted in the
future if the great fall of flood water could be stored
for use when needed. In the rains expected between
now and next May there will be waste. The rivers
will leave their banks, the levees around the garden
islands in the delta of the Sacramento and San Joa
quin will in many cases break and prop
erty will be destroyed. The waste waters, vagrant
and merciless, will wander at will and destroy as
they go. They will wash away the soil and carry it
into the rivers, filling their channels to the destruc
tion of navigation, and will inflict injury upon pro
duction and transportation, the two first in the State's
trinity of wealth-producing factors.
If the State were prepared now to hold the flood
waters in the foothills. in reservoirs at such an alti
tude that the loose soil is not carried with them and
from which their distribution may reach every part of
the valleys below, the rain now hailed with enthu
siasm would have a more than doubled significance.
Now it is received gratefully for what land it makes
fruitful, and with misgivings for what its floods may
destroy. Then it would be saluted as a blessing un
alloyed by loss. It would mean permanent provision
against drought; unimpaired and permanent navi
gability of our meandered rivers; a constant supply
for. mining every day in the year and every year; a
quadrupiication of our grain and fruit and forage
producing area; and such an assurance of the per
manence of agriculture and horticulture as would
add immensely to our population of that desirable
class of small land-holders who are the true expres
sion of the might and majesty of the State. With
such a reservoir system, assuring the permanency of
water and its use at a reasonable charge, a family can
prosper here on the product of twenty or forty acres,
an area within its own capacity to cultivate. There is
no other part of the Union, nor of the world, where
an acre of land will produce as much and in as great
variety as here, not excepting the valley of the Po,
provided the water supply is made permanent. This
is proved over and over again, in the San Joaquin
Valley, in places where the normal flow of the streams
suffices for such permanent supply.
The convention called in this city for the 14th of
next month may come here under umbrellas and in
gumboots. It may meet in the rain, and the windows
of heaven may be open throughout its sessions, but
nevertheless it must meet, and the ranchers, miners,
lumbermen, bankers, shippers and business men of
this State must so realize its importance as to make
it impressive. The rain that falls while it deliberates
means a fat year to come, but still, ahead, famine
smitten, dry and fruitless, lurks and waits a lean year
to devour its substance. That convention can make
California entirely safe from loss by drought or flood.
The engineering problem is simple, the construction
cheaper than anywhere else in the world, the line of
distribution shorter. The water that has been re
leased from one of these reservoirs under a head
and pressure that make electric power to run many
mines, passes from the turbine or Pelton wheel it
has actuated to make grain, grass and fruit grow
within a few miles of the spot where it generated
power to dig and mill gold. Why not harness all this
wasted power and fertility so that such a rainy season
as is coming will represent all gain and no loss?
If Bill Bryan is still out for the stuff, as he was
when he wrote that letter to J. Sterling Morton,
row's his chance to realize. Owners of Columbia
and Shamrock will undoubtedly compensate him
handsomely for the use of his bellows to fill the sails
of their boats.
CITY BOSSES.
THE intention of the new primary law was to end
the rule of bosses by getting together untram
, meled municipal conventions. The history of the'
recent Democratic convention shows that this inten
tion was in some way defeated. The convention was
neither a free agent nor an independent body. It was
bossed and dragooned as completely as any that ever
met in this city in the worst days of openly avpwed
boss rule.
So completely was it under the thumb of two
men, Mr. Pheian and McNab, that The Call was able
to publish its ticket before it met, and did publish it,
through the simple process of finding out who were
on the slate of the two men who did the bossing.
The convention itself might as well have met and
adjourned sine die and let Mr. Pheian and Mr. Mc-
Nab announce the ticket. It may be said that they
are new bosses, untried, and that the result of their
bossing may justify it. But the point is that if they
can secure power by such processes in their party
that will be proof that any other two men may do
the same, and by putting the government in their
hands the way is opened for any other two to do the
same, regardless of how they will use power when
they get it.
It is the first step that costs, and if this city is to
ratify and accept the methods of these it bends its
neck for the yoke of others using the same methods,
no matter how heavy it may be.' The methods which
shut out all advice, prevented all freedom, banished
all deliberation from the Democratic convention and
treated with contempt the friends and supporters of
men as worthy as any who were nominated by
Messrs. Pheian and McNab, are not methods to be
encouraged by the voters of a city like San Fran
cisco. Just such methods have proven ultimately to
be the means of bad government wherever they have
been adopted.
It is noteworthy that the henchmen, the drill
masters and file-closers chosen to swing the rawhide
and carry out the orders of the two bosses were the
trained and seasoned thralls of the several dy
nasties of Democratic bosses who have long
ruled the politics and manipulated the schemes
of that party in this city. They knew how
to carry out orders, how to suppress free expression,
how to walk rough shod over the right ambitions of
the worthy, and they did it all with the rough skill
of artists in their line, accustomed to working ' a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1899.
machine that treats principles as chaff and works
only for place and power for the few who operate it:
Mr. Pheian, in the exuberance of success, with the
confidence of a self-created candidate and absorbed
in admiration of his creator, smiled upon himself
while frowning upon others, and opened his cam
paign by an attack on his opponent which will be
resented by every self-respecting citizen. .
Republicans have before them a plain duty which
should be a pleasure. They will draw to them the in
dependent voters in support of Horace Davis and
the ticket he leads, and they will carry it to victory.
Ir their municipal convention men were not found in
a mad scramble for office; they were there deliber
ating, discussing and seeking candidates of spotless
private and public character to carry the standard of
genuine reform to victory. While they were doing
this wholesome duty Mr. Pheian was sitting on the
housetops proclaiming himself the civic savior of the
city, the sole incarnation of municipal reform and
the only man worthy to be trusted. There are scores of
delegates to the last Democratic State convention who
have not forgotten the incidents in the nomination of
a Justice of the Supreme Court, in which he made a
figure inconsistent with his uttered estimate of him
self.
He has twice succeeded in being elected Mayor by
Republican votes, through professions of non
partisanship, and now hopes for a third time to win
by the same means. He admits that when he called
Hon. Horace Davis "a traitor" it expressed his idea,
and it did. He regards every man, in his own party
and out, who stands in the way of his ambition, as a
traitor. ' In that mood he bossed his own conven
tion, and by easy transfer carries it over in an attack
upon his Republican opponent.
i It is time for the Republicans, who are the major
ity stockholders in this corporation, to resume charge
of its affairs, and they intend to do it.
P Lakes of Killarney are still unsold. Perhaps
if the country surrounding them were cut up into
town lots some enterprising American real estate
speculator, with an experience in suburban ventures,
might undertake to get rid of them. Nature's beauties
are not frequently placed on the auction block.
AMENDING THE WAR TAX LAW.
DISPATCHES from Washington confirm the
statements of The Call that Congress will be
called upon at the coming session to amend
, the war tax law for the purpose of eliminating cer
tain defects which have resulted in diminishing the
amount of revenue expected to be. derived from it.
In discussing the subject an agent in this city of
the Internal Revenue Department is quoted as' say
ing the greatest loss has been due to a decision of the
Attorney General that undivided profits in banks are
. not to be considered as capital or surplus and there
fore are not subject to the tax on undivided surplus.
j He estimates that in the northeastern districts of Cali
, fornia alone the Government loses between $200,000
and $300,000 a year by that ruling.
â  The agent is reported to have added: "Some
money is lost on the wine tax by restaurant keepers
serving wine in pitchers instead of bottles which are
taxed, and also by the use of tax stamps a second
: and a third time. This loss could be avoided by
taxing the wine in the winery, or by having strip
stamps fastened to the cork and to the bottle in such
I a way that the cork could not be drawn without
breaking the stamp. I have no doubt that Congress
will amend the law so that those leakages will be
checked."
The defects pointed out are but a few of the many
that have been noted in the law. They. serve, how
eevr, to show how necessary it is to revise the law
and materially amend it. The wine tax, for example,
; ought to be abolished utterly or so completely al
tered as to make it something quite different from
what it is. As it stands it is virtually a tax upon
California alone. There is no other State in the
Union where the people use light wines habitually
at. meals, and consequently a tax on wines making no
discrimination between the costliest brands and the
light wines used at the table is unfair. If the wine
tax be continued it should at least impose a tax 1
graded to the value of the wine, so that the popular |
restaurants of California should not have to pay as |
njuch on the claret served at meals as is imposed !
I upon champagne.
JThe chief defect of the law, however, is one to
which the revenue official made no reference. The
Call has repeatedly pointed out that by reason of the
delay of the courts in bringing to final adjudication
the controversy between the people and the express
and the telegraph companies the tax shirking cor
porations are daily engaged in extorting money from
their patrons in every part of the Union. To rem
edy that defect should be the first object of Congress,
for it is the one which works more injustice and is
most exasperating to the taxpayers.
; It is probable some of the Government officials
arc indifferent as to who pays the stamp taxes on tele
graph messages and express receipts so long as the
Government receives the money. It is as well to I
point out, therefore, that the Wells-Fargo Express
Company, at any rate, has been as willing to defraud
lie Government as to rob the people. As soon as
the tax was imposed that company made to The Call
ait; offer to receive from it a whole wagon-load of
packages as one package, thus cheating the national
revenue to that extent. It is not likely the offer was
made to The Call only. Probably a good many large
. s,hippers have taken advantage of it, and the total
loss of revenue by the trick may be considerable.
The war tax law was drawn up and enacted in a
hurry to meet' the needs of the Government at the
time. Experience has shown it to be defective in
many ways. Congress, therefore, not be con-.
: tent with amending it here and there. The whole law
, should be reviewed, revised and recast. The burdens
or taxation should be made as equal as possible upon
all sections and all classes, and there should be no
way open for tax-shirkers to extort money from the
public or to defraud the Government.
jWhen Mayor Pheian insisted that a military man
ir^st be placed on the local Democratic ticket he
probably did not think that his demand would be
taken as a declaration of war. The candidacy of
Major Geary has certainly created a wild, warlike
demonstration in the ranks of the Democratic faithful

MOVABLE CHURCH-NOVEL
IDEA OF A PASTOR.
TWENTY OXEN DRAW THE PERAM
BULATING STRUCTURE FROM
ONE SPOT TO ANOTHER.
JAMESTOWN, Conanlcut Island, R. 1., Aug. 22.â Religious zeal has Improved
on the scriptural injunction to go into the highways and byways and compel sin
ners to attend church. The modern zealot brings a movable church to the highway
and byway wanderer and saves him the trouble of walking. The leader in this new
method of lifting the church out of the rut is the Rev. Charles Earl 1 reston, who
ls ln charge of St. Matthew's Church, on this island. Churches are few and far
between, and the people whom the good minister wishes to reach are scattered all
over the island. One church is sufficient for the inhabitants of several square
miles, but they will not come to church. Therefore the only thing to do is to take
the church to them. But how? Necessity in this emergency conceived the idea of
a movable church, and the Idea took tangible shape ln a structure that has just
made it- first trip, drawn by a team of oxen loaned by the pious farmers of that
locality.' The building, which is the invention of the Rev. Mr. Preston, is not a
structure of minute proportions, but a pretentious edifice, the furnishings of which
alone cost $3000. The audience room of the church measures 18x27 feet, and the
furniture is elaborate and beautiful. The building is mounted on a set of wheels
substantial enough to safely .bear the weight of the structure and with tires wide
enough to pass readily over any soft parts that may be encountered on the road
way. The first journey of the movable church was made without any accident or
injury to the building. The people assembled in great numbers to see the church
started on Its tour. Men and women came from Middletown and from the north
ern part of the Island, where all the native oxen, are owned, which, after being at
tached to the chapel, were ready for the start. There were twenty of these an
cient beasts of burden in line. C. H. Congdon of Rhode Island was the master of
ceremonies.
The rear wheels of the church had been Slightly elevated on planks, and as
soon as the brakes were off the building began to move, almost before the oxen
had straightened the chain. The bell was struck and the little building gracefully
rolled Into West street and after being pulled through the soft grass ground
turned up Cole street and rounded into Narragansett avenue. Down the remain
ing length of Narragansett avenue rolled the church, the tones of the bell pealing
out merrily. The doors and windows of dwellings were filled with eager faces and
the sidewalks were at times crowded by anxious persons who wanted to see "how
the thing would go." The first stop was made at a point where it was necessary
to wait for a lineman to cut a guy wire, which had caused the colors to be expe
ditiously lowered. Another halt was made soon after, but this time it was to re
move the detachable cross and ball so that the spire could pass under the telephone
wires. A lineman seated himself on the belfry and raised, one by one, the many
wires in places where they cross the roadway, until all such obstructions had been
successfully passed. ,". V -.?..'â ',';.
Once clear of the town, up hill and down dale rolled the movable church, the
nature of the roadway occasionally necessitating a little "jacking up" to prevent
accident, but beyond that no trouble occurred.
There are several springs of water on Conanlcut, and certain seasons of the
year the sidehllls show signs of moisture. A few of these spots were encountered
at the approach of what has recently been called Storks Hill. The hill surmount
ed, It was decided to locate on a site which had been offered by the Hon. Thomas
G. Carr, the owner of one of the oldest farms on the island. Luncheon was here
supplemented by what the ladies in this neighborhood provided for the helpers
The building was backed upon the lot and can be seen for miles around, both from
Narragansett Bay and the island of Rhode Island. Here it will remain until the
time for to be taken to the next resting place, and services will be held as fre
quently as seems well to the pastor. So much curiosity has been excited by the
novel church that there Is no possibility of audiences falling off for some time to
come. :>, : ',Q L >â 'â¢ '.;:

The scientific achievement of transmit

through the Marconi system must be re
garded as one of the most important of
Its class. Until Signor Marconi demon
strated his theory in reporting the yacht
race of last Thursday many people were
inclined to regard him as a good-natured
but unpromising visionary, pursuing an
idle but harmless phantom. But the, de
tails and result of the yacht race were
fully and accurately reported, and that
too in spite of, the fact that the weather
conditions were supposed to be least fa

new. invention. . When the vessels were so
faraway as to be lost in the haze their

BID OF THE SUTTER-STREET
COMPANY FILED.

Received by the County Clerk Yester
day and the Court Will Pass
on It Early Next
Week.
Sutro's machine that' brought the
Market-street Company to its knees and
reduced the fare to the beach to 5 cents
will -non pass into the hands of the
Sutter-street Railway Company. This
company has made Its bid for the prop
erties of the Sutro Railway Company,
and as it is the largest and best Judge
Coffey will doubtless confirm the order of
sale .â¢id an elephant will be taken from
the hands of the executors of the Sutro
will. Yestettiay afternoon Mrs. Emma L.
Merritt and W. R. H. Adamson, who are
the legal representatives of the estate,
accompanied by counsel, filed the bid of
the Sutter-street Company in the office of
the County Clerk. A day has not yet been
set for the confirmation of sale, but early
next week the matter will finally be
passed upon by Judge Coffey.
Over and above the debts of the road
and incumbrances on the depot site and
right of way, the Sutro estate will clear
only about $45,000, which is made clear
in the bid of the Sutter-street Company
filed by President R. F. Morrow yesterday
afternoon. This bid also proves the oft
repeated assertion that the railroad has
practically been the property of the bidder
since July last, and the confirmation of
the sale will only be a matter of form.
The bid filed by the Sutter-street Com
pany reads:
Referring to the contract bjfween us entered
Into on the ISth day of July, 1899. and In com
pliance with its terms I hereby offer to pur
chase from the estate of Adolph Sutro. de
ceased, the 21,310 shares of the capital stock
of the Sutro Railroad Company, a corporation,
referred to ln cur agreement, and I hereby
offer to pay for said shares of stock the sum
of $30,000, and In addition thereto I agree,
upon confirmation of this sale, to assume and
pay the indebtedness of the Sutro Railroad
Company, which you have caused to be fur
nished to me, and which statement is an
nexed hereto and made part hereof, showing
an aggregate indebtedness of $114,065 81.
I further agree that if the sale of the stock
Is confirmed to me upon the terms above
pr<*clfled, so that the control of the Sutro
Railroad Company shall be immediately passed
to me, I will cause and procure said corpora
tion to bid for the depot grounds and strip
of land from Point I.' â bos avenue to said depot
grounds, for which you have procured an order
of sale, the sum of $15,944 05.
The foregoing- bid is made upon the condi
tion precedent that you procure the right to
lease, and â¢.hat you lease to the Sutro Rail
road Company, the powerhouse, as specified
ln our agreement of July IS. 1899.
I furthermore agree that if you can obtain
cny rebate upon the Judgments or other claims
naalnst the Sutro Railroad Company as speci
f.-.l such rebate shall Inure to your benefit.
If. however, there shall be any errors or ornis-
Fior.s in your statement of liabilities and if the
Indebtedness shall exceed the amount therein
specified such excess shall be deducted from
the amount of this bid.
it Is distinctly uruWstood that this bid is

<>':r agreement of July lÂ«. If â¢â¢. and subject to
nU Us terms .md conditions, excepting that
1 rÂ°sÂ«rve $1"..54 . 0", to be paid for the depot
grounds and strip of land instead of $10,000,
as contemplated by said agreement.
Mrs. Merritt and W. R. H. Adamson,
executors of the estate, set forth in their
?etltlon that it is for the best interests of
he estate that the sale be confirmed.
Judging from the schedule of liabilities,
their opinion is correct. It shows that
salaries remain to be paid, materials must
be settled for. Almost every branch of
the railroad management shows a deficit.

TWO BIG CONVENTIONS
MAY BE BROUGHT HERE
CITIZENS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THE IDEA
: |
Democrats and Republicans of Our ! City
Working Shoulder to Shoulder j -
for Success.
WITH the published announcement that there Is to be a meeting of the
Republican National Committee at "Washington early in December has
come increased interest in the project of securing the convention seat
of the tww great national parties for San Francisco in 1900. Thefproposi
tion has met with unqualified and universal indorsement on all sides,
and confidence is generally expressed that with proper effort San Francisco can
secure the distinction coveted.
Nearly every person who discusses the matter finds some new reason why San
Francisco should be given the prize, and not the least of these is the fact that
her growing Importance as a commercial entrepot in the past two years has been
so phenomenal as to attract widespread attention in the country and create an
intense curiosity to see the metropolis of the Pacific Coast and the States imme
diately, tributary to it.
Among the cities that are reported to be candidates for the honor of enter
taining the members of the conventions are Cleveland, Denver, Kansas City,
Milwaukee, Pittsburg, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Minneapolis and San Francisco, it
is said that Chicago will also contend for the votes of the committeemen.
J. J. Dwyer, Democratic National Committeeman from California, is out ot
town, and Is not expected to return for about two weeks, but his friends declare
that he will spare no effort with his colleagues in the interests of this city.
John D. Spreckels, the member of the Republican National Commi'-tee from
California, expects to leave for the East in about ten days, and in an interview
yesterday stated that he would begin missionary work on , the proposition at the
earliest opportunity. "I believe that If proper efforts are made," he said, it is
more than likely that the convention of the Republicans at least can be secured
for San Francisco. So far as 1 know there is no other city active in the matter
at the present time, except St. Louis. With concerted and well-directed action
1 believe it can be brought out here. When 1 was at St. Louis, during the last
convention, I heard expressions from many of the delegates that they wished
they were out on the coast, Instead of sweltering in the tropical heat where they
were.
"I shall attend the meeting of the National Committee and make every effort
to secure the convention for San Francisco. I believe that a large number of the
members will be In favor of this city on the ground of its climatic advantages
alone. Prompt action ought to be taken by the people here In view of the ear ly
day at which it is reported the meeting of the National Committee is to be held
for the purpose of selecting the convention seat.
"I expect to go East in about ten days, and shall do some preliminary work
Immediately after my arrival there. I shall see as many of the National Commit
teemen as possible and endeavor to win them over to the cause of San Francisco.
But much might also be done by having a representative delegation from, our
city present at the meeting of the committee."
F. W. Dohrmann, president of the Merchants' Association, after referring to
the great advantages that would undoubtedly accrue to the city and Sta*.Â», said:
"I think it is about time we should have these conventions out here. Perhaps
there never was a time when there was more likelihood of inducing them to
come to San Francisco If a strong effort were mad. in that direction. The atten
tion which San Francisco has attracted during the past two years has made many
people anxious to get acquainted with Californians in their homes and learn more
about our great State and the coast generally. They formerly considered us out
of the world. That San Francisco has grown strongly in interest to the people of
the East was very strikingly impressed on me during my trip to the East last
year, and this Interest has since been intensified. .
"Besides that, it seems to me that every American expects to come to Cali
fornia sooner or later. 1 never ask people whose acquaintance I make- in the
East 'Are you coming?' but 'When are you coming to California?! I, invariably
found that each one had it in mind to pay us a visit. I believe that -if the con
ventions or either of them were held in this city it would bring all these people
and thousands of others."
E. A. Denlcke, president of the Mechanics' Institute, Is a strong advocate of
the project. "It goes without saying." he remarked, "that It would be very
desirable to have. the national conventions meet in this city. We Have ample
accommodations for all who may come. Among other things, we have a very
large and comfortable assembly room In the Mechanics' Pavilion, so; there will
not be any need to erect one. California is at last beginning to receive that at
tention which is due her in a commercial sense and in every way. It ls very
desirable that the State of California should become known, especially to the
statesmen, so that her needs may be properly provided fur. which has not al
ways been the case heretofore."
"I am heartily in favor of the movement." said Horace Davis, the Republi
can candidate for Mayor. "A strong argument that could be used to Influence
the action of the Eastern members is our geographical position relative to our
new acquisitions In the Pacific. By coming here our political leaders would get a
clearer idea of the significance to San Francisco and the coast of our new* pos
sessions and their commercial importance. The holding of the conventions In
this city would bring the party leaders closer in touch and sympathy with our
needs and advantages. It is important to us and, to the country at large that
our prominence as a commercial center should be fully realized and appre
ciated. It Is certainly true that something ought to be done to turn the eyes
of the country toward California. "When you go East it is seldom you see any
notice In the newspapers of what is going on in California, the second largest
State in the Union, and which has advantages that are second to none."
Frank McLaughlin, chairman of the Republican State Central Committee,
when asked for an expression of opinion in regard to the matter, evinced great
interest in It by his look, but his evident ambition ls to be considered dead to the
world, as he is ln politics. "I decline to be Interviewed on this or any other
subject," he answered.
"But as chairman of the Republican State Central Committee, the people
of the party you represent and of the State generally naturally expect that you
would take a deep Interest in a matter of this kind, which Is' admitted to be of
great Importance to California. Tou certainly have some opinion '.n reference tc
the proposition," urged the reporter. .
"No; a word will you get from me. I simply decline to be interviewed on
any subject for any paper." And the major swelled up, smiled, swelled up
again and turned away. ' A - -
THE SAM FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1899.
WINE-GROWERS
DID NOT SUFFER
FROM THE STORM
Were Favored by an
Early Season.
Â«.
LITTLE OF THE CROP WAS ON
THE VINES.
*
In Some Sections the Moisture Will
Be Beneficial â of the
Wine Men Are Brighter
Than for Years.
The fact that there was a short vintage
and that the grapes ripened early with
good saccharine strength, thus enabling
the producers to gather their crop
promptly was a matter of great good for
tune to the growers of wine grapes in
California this year.
Among those who were not acquainted
with the situation there was anxiety as
to the safety of the latter part of the
vintage when the recent unprecedented
storm swept over the- State. In ordinary
years the downpour would have done a
great deal of damage, but fortunately on
this occasion the producers wore prepared
for such a visitation and instead of the
storm being a detriment it will in some
cases doubtless prove a benefit. In speak
ing of the situation yesterday Secretary
rlotchkiss of the California Wine Makers'
Corporation said:
"1 don't think the storm has done any
particular Injury to the wine grapes, fori
the reason that in most districts the vint
age was practically over. This was the
case in Sonoma and Napa, while in Santa j
Clara the grapes still ungathered are of
varieties that will not suffer from the
wetting. In any event they would be all
right for distillation if gathered at once.
"In the Warm Springs section I believe
there Is still considerable of the -crop on I
the vines. However, they are zlnfand^ls, I
high in sugar strength, and the moisture I
will probably add to their productivity. !
Of course, if the storm should continue or I
cold and dampness prevail It would be j
necessary to handle the remainder of the |
crop in short order. Taking everything
Into consideration, the wine men have
every reason to be thankful that the
heavy rain did not come sooner."
At the present time the industry is ln
better condition as to prices and
prospects than It has been in
many years. The steadily grow
ing demand for California wines, the
gradual falling off In production and the
liberal offer of Henry J. Crocker to buy
all the dry wine grapes in the State for a I
term of seven years have tended to estab- 'â¢
lish a certain fixed value of wine vineyard
products, and as a result the producer and
merchant will fare unusually well this
year. The only cloud overshadowing the
Industry at the present time is the steady I
and destructive advance of the phyllox
era, but good prices will eventually cause !
the replanting of vineyards with resistant i
stock and bring the product up to the i
luture demand. .." r

ASSOCIATION WILL
BE MADE PERMANENT
DELEGATES FROM NORTH AND
SOUTH MEET HERE.
Basis of Representation for the Joint
Body of Wholesalers and Manu
facturers on the Coast Has
Been Fixed.
It is probable that steps will be taken
within the next few days to bring about a
permanent organization of the whole
salers, Jobbers and manufacturers of the
Pacific Coast. Yesterday a committee of
the Pacific Coast Traffic Association met
In Los Angeles with an organization of
the wholesalers and Jobbers of the south
ern city, formed during the present week.
The necessity for the Pacific Coast to act
as a unit in matters concerning the trans
portation of overland freights and the
control of trade territory resulted in the
sending of a delegation from this city to
Portland, Tacoma and Seattle recently.
That delegation fully accomplished what
was expected of It. and the report of the
proceedings in the Northwest has been
approved by the executive committee of
the Traffic Association.
The organization formed at Los Angeles
will undoubtedly work in harmony with
the wholesalers and jobbers of San Fran
cisco, Tacoma. Portland and Seattle.
A basis of the permanent organization
has been fixed and has been adopted by
the northwestern wholesalers and Job
bers. For every ten subscribers each city
will be permitted to send one delegate
to the meeting to be held in this city.
Then the delegates will finally settle all
matters relating to the plan of action.
The present Traffic Association was nec
essarily made temporary, for there were
no delegates from abroad.

An Arrangement With Father.
Charles (loquitur)â lt is quite true, !
father, as you say, that our religious j
duties are of signal moment, but they
are often perplexing and some of them
often seem to me to conflict with others.
Perhaps you and I could cover the
ground better if we used some judicious
plan of co-operation. Suppose, for ex
ample, that you obey the injunction,
"Give to him that asketh," and leave
me to supplement your efforts by tak
ing no thought for the morrow?â Life.

Some anxiety is felt in shipping and
Insurance circles over the American ship
Charles E. Moody and the British ship
St. Enoch. The former is now out 179
days from Norfolk. Va., for Honolulu
with a cargo of coal for the Government
and 45 per cent reinsurance Is being paid
on her. The St. Enoch is % days out
from Panama for San Francisco and 15
per cent 1;? being paid to reinsure her
chances.
The Moody is owned in San Francisco, j
having recently been purchased by Lewis,
Anderson & Co. She is a fine wooden
vessel and well found to cope with any j
kind of weather. It is her cargo of coal j
that the underwriters fear, however. The ;
St. Enoch Is coming here from Panama
In ballast, and judging from the pas
sages made by other vessels from that
port she is not very much overdue.
The German man-of-war Geier is to re- |
turn to San Francisco. She will leave I
Vancouver, B. C, on the 18th Inst, for
this city and after a short stay will pro
ceed to Central America.
The bark Alden Besse arrived last night
from Honolulu after a fine passage of 17
days. The barkentines Planter and S. x.
Castle were 29 and 28 days respectively
making the run, so the showing made
by the Alden Besse is a particularly good
one.

Runaway on Taylor Street.
Yesterday afternoon a team of horses
belonging to the Morton Drayage Com
pany, while standing on Taylor street,
near Kills, took fright at a passing ve
hicle and darted down Taylor street at a
mad rate, demolishing several posts on
its way. On arriving near Turk street its
course was suddenly checked by collid
ing with a delivery wagon belonging to
Faber & Co., grocers, which was stand
ing in front of their store at the time.
The wagon was smashed into splinters by
the force of the collision and the horse
so badly 'injured that it had to be de
stroyed. The runaway team escaped
without damage.

Pennsylvania military band will play. The
bazaar will continue one more week.
Declined to Reindict.
The Grand Jury yesterday refused to re-
Indict P. McAran and M. C. Hayes for
perjury. McAran and Hayes went on tho
bond of Eddy Brooks, -who was accused
of grand larceny, and were Indicted by
the last Grand Jury. They filed a demur
rer, which was sustained by Judge Law
lor. to the effect that the Indictment was
defective, but lie refused to dismiss tha
defendants. It appears that the piece of
property of which they claimed to be
joint owners is owned by Hayes alone. m
An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Strut of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to'overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels", without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are' obtained from senna and
i other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package.

in excellent condition and hard workers.
'1 he two first named have had a wide ex
perience In boat racing.
For the senior shell race there are three
entries, and the same Dumber for the
junior shell race. In the former event J.
P. Foley of the South Ends Is likely to
prove the winner, and in the latter George
Lewis of the Alameda Boat Club. The
Alameda champions, the Pioneers, and the
South Ends are entered in the senior
barge race, but only F. W. Ayefs and W.
G. Hanson are left of the Alameda crew
that rowed at Astoria, K. li. Hadcock
having taken the bow seat and D. <;.
Greenleaf rowing No. 3. The South
End crew, consisting of Pallas, Breen,
Lyons and Scully, with G. McGrill as
cockswain, have been practicing regu
larly, and In their new Rogers barge are
likely to win.
The South End junior barge crew is in
good trim and consists of strong men well
trained. It will probably win the junior
championship. If it does so it will row
over the course for the intermediate
barge championship. Several of the. con
testants are entered in two or more
events, Dr. C. C. Dennis being in the
senior skiff, junior and intermediate barge
races; .1. P. Foley pulling in the senior
shell, junior and Intermediate barge; D.
G. Greenleaf rowing in the senior and
junior barge crews of the Alameda. Club,
and E. B. Hade of Alameda being en-
rod in the senior shell race and also in
the senior baige event. F. W. Ayers not
being able to secure a boat to his liking
has not entered in the senior skiff event.
in the junior barge race the Ariel crew
consists entirely of men entered in that
event only, whereas the Alameda and
South End crews have two men each who
j-.ro entered for other events. This ought
to be a deoiderl advantage to the Ariels,
who Iwv n practicing faithfully and
doing go.hi work.
There will be a cutter race between dl
visionÂ« 1 and 2 of the Naval Battalion.
The entries for the second division crew
were given In Tuesday's Call, while the

Last Sunday the new handball court of
the South End Rowing Club was formally
opened, Al Hampton and partner playing
four games against Kilgallon and Line
ban of Ryan's court. Each pair won two
games. The senior and junior intermedi
ate-barge crews went out in the new
Rogers boat under the direction of Cap
tain Will Thomas. Roth crews rowed well
together, and they have hopes of pulling
off all three barge championships, the in

â¢THE OLYMPIC AMD OHIVErOITY OF. CALIFORNIA, TEArD
Ifi THE FIRt)T GAME qf THE REASON <> Â« Â«
COACHES AND ELEVENS
HARD AT THEIR WORK
University of California Football Players Will Meet the Olympics
To-Day for the Second Time.
/' I '>HE public which follows football had an opportunity to
1 ?auge both the college teams and their mutual competitor;
THE Olympics. The prevalent opinion is that the Unlver
gauge both the college teams and their mutual competitor,
the Olympics. The prevail nt opinion is that the Univer-
I sity of California has the strongest team In the field and
â  at this early day of the season 13 In a position which
should result in a victory on Thanksgiving day, when Blue and
Gold crosses Cardinal.
Assurance often means victory, but a talk with Conches
Ccchran and Kelly produces no such confidence In California's
success. Stanford has just begub a season In which everything
will be formative and evolutionary. Chamberlin is coach par
excellence for just such work, and every day something is done
ward the making of a team at Palo Alto. To say that Cali
fornia has an unshakable hold on the intercollegiate game is
reckoning without the host. A; much stronger and better game
will have to be played by the Dim- and Gold to win the great
yearly contest than has been played during the last week.
Nothing will really be known of the ability of the Cardinal
eleven until two weeks before the big game. At that time a
Stanford team will be formed and will play as the eleven rep
resenting the college. Until then every Stanford team seen in
this city Will be an experimental one. This may or may not
be a disadvantage. Cochran took raw material last year, de
veloped it and created a team that stuck together like mucilage.
Coach Chamberlain is doing the same with Stanford, and if
matters progress there with the steady improvement the work
already shows the Cardinal will have a team worth;.- of any
California can put in the field, j
A slump has struck Berkeley and Cochran is by no means
satisfied with the team's work; During the week "Locomotor"
Smith. Kaarsberg, VVomble and Hall were laid off on account
of slight injuries and a too early rounding Into condition. Cali
fornia ls coming into shape ratjier rapidly, and the trainers are
exercising the greatest watchfulness over the men in regard to
physical condition. The practice game on the California
campus has been slow, comparing it with that which the
coaches think it should be. Ccebran, since Kelly's advent, has
been giving most of his time to the team play, with occasional
advice to linesmen. Kelly is hÂ»idling the backs, and the Cali
fornia players have discovered that there were several things
in back-of-the-llne play they had not learned.
Whipple's injury will keep him out of the game for some
time, and his position at tackle is now being played by different
men. When Smith, Womble, Kaarsberg and Hall were taken
out of the game the substitute men were given a chance, and
for a time everything was chaotic on the California team.
These four men will probably play in the game this afternoon,
as Cochran is strong in the belief that the team which is likely
to meet Stanford on Thanksgiving day should receive as much
practice in match games as possible. California's men will be
in no better condition to-day than when the Olympics met them
two weeks ago In the opening game of the season.
The Olympics' confidence of an unbroken string of victories
has given way to a hopefulness for a victory. "With material
that is equal to the best they have been vanquished by Califor
nia, an experienced but light team, and tied by Stanford, inex
perienced and also light in weight. The clubmen are beginning
to think that Individuals are not everything and something
must be done to shake off the "hoodoo." This week the men
have trained with more spirit, and the public is promised that
the team will know its signals without painful waits. Some
changes will be made in the line-up of the team, In the first
half Varney and Dinsmore will play halves and Thlerkauf full
back. In the second half Felton Taylor will play fullback,
Thierkauf probably going to one of the end positions. On the
line a few changes will have the effect of making a new forma
tion. Monroe will occupy the central position, with Cadwallader
stump of the log, and expects to have his
patient running around freely hi a few
Weeks. ... t
J. B. Martin, the noted fox terrier ox
pert, has refused the invitation of the
California Collie Club to judge that breed
at Oakland. He does not care to counte
nance shows held under any other than
American Kennel Club rides. Mr. Mar
tin's action is warmly applauded by the
fanciers of the coast.
A movement has been instituted by the
StÂ» Bernard Club in petitioning the San
Francisco Kennel Club to appoint L. L.
Campbell superintendent, as he commend
ed himself to exhibitors at the late show
by his impartial enforcement of the rules.
It is unlikely that tin- San Francisco
Kennel Club will accede to the request
of the convention of specialty clubs to
hold the next show in April. It is con
sidered that the uncertain weather would
endanger its financial success. Besides
which none but short-haired dogs would
be in good coat and fit for exhibition.
Joseph Cutteh'a rough coated St. Ber
nard, Alta Maud, by Dictator out of Alta
Rosa, has whelped fifteen puppies, of
which eleven are dogs, to the late Alto
Milo by Judith's Sir Bedwere out of
Santa Rosa.

rises with the yeast in it.
F. O. YOUNG EQUALS WORLD'S RECORD
FOR TEN SHOTS WITH A REVOLVER
FO. YOUNG, a member of the Columbia Pistol and Rifle
Club of this city, has. equaled the world's revolver rec
ord. Some weeks since Thomas Anderton, the expert
_ revolver shot of the East, made the phenomenal score
' â¢ of 35 points In ten shots on the Columbia target ln a
80-shot match. His score equaled 96 out of a possible 100 points
on the standard American target, which Is brilliant shooting.
F. O. Young, one of a -little .group of experts in this city, an
nounced at once that he would try for the record at the first
opportunity. Tills developed last Sunday at Harbor View
range.
Mr. Young made a match to shoot his .4 S. & W. Russian
model revolver against P. Becker and G. Hoadley, who used tar
get pistols. In his ten shots at fifty yards on the Columbia
target with a four-inch bullseye Mr. Young made 1, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4,
3, 2, 1, 7â35 pointsâ equals Anderton's record and beats'
the Pacific Coast record of 41, held by J. E. Gorman. Out of
the ten shots seven of the bullets wore placed within the four
inch circle, while the average was 3.5 inches. The poorest shot
was 3Vfc inches from the dead center. ', : i

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 13.â With the cooler
weather there has come a revived interest upon the gridiron,
and, excepting Rice, all of Stanford's varsity players are none
the worse for their brush with the Olympics last Saturday.
From now on tin- coaches will devote more time to the fine
points of the game, and when chamberlin next sends his men
to the city it will be as a team rather than a mere aggregation.
This week has seen the addition of two men to the line
which will materially stiffen and strengthen it. "Babe" Bur
nett, the giant center of the 1897 team, has donned his suit
again after a week of training under the care of Dr. Murphy
and is in fairly good condition, tipping the beam at 190 pounds.
It is probable he will be seen at tackle this year, as Cham
berlin is desirous of playing him there. In this case Ed Gilman
will play the center position, as he has the necessary weight
and experience. The other man is De Forrest, for several years
guard on the Multnomah team of Portland and one of the best
players in the north. His position is guard,' where he will be
placed immediately by the coaches, who have been waiting for
euch an acquisition to the team. The ends will be well looked
after, but back of the line the outlook is not so promising.
Garth Parker, a veteran at the end of the line, is being tried
at half, and though he Is quick he has the unpardonable fault
of running back - with the ball. Until he overcomes this he
has poor prospects of becoming such a ground gainer as the
position calls for. The other half will undoubtedly be a fresh
man, as will also be the fullback. Roberts, Campbell, Jordan
and Willot are candidates for the latter place, while Wilson,
Smith, Allen, Raitt and Parkin are in the race for the former.
The trainers and coaches mingle with their men both on the
field and off It. and are coming to know just what work each
man can do. The early establishment of the training table
and the constant supervision of a skilled trainer precludes the
danger of fever which was so current among the squad last
year.
The past week has been given up partially to interclass
games, which have done much to bring out the crowd and de
velop enthusiasm. As the time for the freshman intercollegi
ate match draws near the baby team continues to show im
provement. The work of the team is good, considering that its
personnel is changed with each game. They have the best ma
terial that has come Into the university since the class of '9S
entered, and there is no reason why the men should not give
a good account of themselves before the season is. over. How
ever, they have much to accomplish yet before they are a
strong team, and the attention of the coaches 'must be directed
toward them for the next two weeks if they hope for victory.
TAIL-ENDERS
WILL MEET IN
A HOT FIGHT
This Is the week in which the balltossers
of Oakland are going to try the great act
of forcing the Crabs of Santa Cruz into
last place. The Duties are inflated with
recent success and are imbued with the
notion that nothing can stop them, so for
midable have they proved of late. On
the other hand, Manager Tuttle of Santa
Cruz attributes the comparatively poor
showing of his aggregation to nothing
but hard luck. The fact is that Santa
Cruz has been suffering from weakness In
the box. Whelan has been pitching win
ning ball, but Andrews and Balsz appear
to have lost their cunning. Tuttle has
strengthened his team by substituting
McCarthy for Williams at second base,
and he thinks that he now possesses the
fastest Infield in the State. McCarthy
was formerly the mainstay of the Wat
sonville club. Besides being a good
striker, he is capable of playing any posi
tion on the diamond.
- Oakland and Santa Cruz will play two
games in this city and one in Oakland on
Sunday morning, while the local team will

THREATENING
WEATHER IS
DUCK WEATHER
Hence Gunmen Go Joyously
to Their Preserves This
Week.
With the thermometer registering over
| 100 degrees the gunners who went in quest
j of ducks last Sunday enjoyed but little
I sport to compensate them for their exer
tions. The members of the Teal and
I Ibis clubs did no shooting, while there
was but little organized shooting on any
of the preserves. Those who did secure
birds did not enjoy them, as they would
not stand transportation. Down about
Alvarado no birds were to be seen.
Although the week opened with poor
firomise of sport for some time to come,
t closed with brightened prospects.
Threatening weather is duck weather, and
the elements have done more than threat
en since Wednesday. As a sequence the
clubmen will seek their preserves joy
ously this week and expect well-filled
game bags. The district over which men
may shoot will be extended, as ground
that has been dry will have filled with
water, thus forming new ponds.
Reports received from Southern Oregon
are to the effect that enormous numbers
of birds are to be found there. These will
ln time come southward and will spread
out over this country, providing sensa
tional sport later on.
A. M. Shields was the. most successful
man last Sunday on the Prlngle Club's
preserve near Suisun, securing eighteen
birds, sixteen of them being sprig.
The men on the Olympic Gun Club pre
serve last Sunday were: George Walker.
Dr. A. T. Derby, H. L. Miller, Howard
Black, W. A. Marshall and Fred Feudner.
Despite the heat, they tried the sport, the
average bag being about five birds.
On Wednesday the sport was better,
owing to the marked change in the
weather. Al Gumming: secured eleven
sprig, four mallard and a white goose.
W. D. McArtliur killed seven sprig, two
mallard, a goose and a spoonbill. A F
Hoepke, H. L. Miller and J. Homer Frltcli
all bad fair sport over the decoys.
W. F. Whittier Jr. did great execution
near Suisun on Wednesday, getting lit;
birds. This is the best shooting reported
from any of the preserves this season.
ROAD RACE POSTPONED.
The annual ten-mile handicap road race
of the Associated Cycling Clubs, which
was scheduled to be run to-morrow over
the straightaway course from Fruitvale
to Haywards, has been postponed for one
week owing to the Inclement weather.
The racing board decided that this was
the best plan, as it is hard on the riders
and somewhat dangerous, to run a race
over a muddy road, and besides the men
will be afforded another week in which
to train for the event. The entries al

THE AMERICAN
WATERLOO HERE
Local Leashmen Will Strive to
Secure Next Year's Clas
sic Event.
The coursing men of California will
make a strong effort to have the Ameri
can Waterloo, one of the classic events
in the coursing year, held in this State
next season. The stake will be run tnis
year on the 20th inst. on an inclosed
field at Dallas, Texas. Only two Califor
nia dogsâ Emm Pasha and Metallicâ of
Pasha Kennels will be in the ' running.
John Halton, who has gone on to" the
meeting, Is commissioned to invite the
American Coursing Board to run off its
greatest event in this State next year.
The sport on . this coast has outgrown
that of the East. While the added money
for the American Waterloo is only $600
Ingleslde and Union Park each add near
ly $800 or more every week in the year.
Union Park adds over $1000 this week to
mark its one hundredth coursing meeting.
One hundred and forty-four dogs will go
to the silos' ln two stakes. It seems each
week that the highest class dogs have
been entered, but this stake towers above
all others in quality.
Ingleslde Coursing Club was largely
represented on Thursday at the funeral of
John Eagan, an obi time coursing man.
Mr. Eagan owned stJme notable perform
ers, the. test of them being Mayflower.
He also owned Sly Girl, another brilliant
performer, before coursing had developed
into a business proposition. Of the dogs
which ran in his name in recent years
Billy Gladstone was considered the best.
He was the runner-up In last year's Pro
duce stake.
Sterl & Knowles will start Frosty
Morn, their latest Australian Importation,
at Union Park this week. He is a brin
dle dog of good size and quality and
should equal the performances of the
same firm's imported Sleety Mist on the
field.
The most notable sale of greyhounds
ever made on this coast was that effected
by.D. J. Heaiy of Petaluma during the
past week. He disposed of six of his
kennel for $2000. The dogs Include Rusty
Gold, O'Hara, For Glory, Amarosa, Oleta
and Ripple. All except the latter two
have been thoroughly tried out and have
shown themselves to be high-class per
formers. The dogs are running in the.
name of Sterl & Knowles, but the pur
chaser is said to be a woman who has
taken. a deep interest in coursing. Before
. purchasing the Haley dogs she offered
Tim Cromn $600 for Wild Tra.ee or $1000
for Wild Tralee and Thornhill. The of
fer was declined.
This sale Indicates that the commercial
side of coursing Is just beginning to as
sume prominence and old time ieashraen
find it difficult to embrace the new order
of affairs. In the past money was sel
dom paid for dogs, most of them being
secured in trade or as gifts. â¢ .
Secretary Nichols of the American
Coursing Board will come to this coast
for the Dlains meeting of the Interstate
Coursing Club. Mr. Handy of the cours
ing firm of Handy & Smith is also ex

The management of Union Coursing
Park has disbursed $54,618 50 in prizes
during the past year and as much more
to the 120 men employed at the park in

The changes in the field at Ingleslde
have reduced the chances of fluky

able approximation can be given, but this
will be valuable In a general way.
Among the difficulties to be met In the
calculation are included different soils,
which absorb water in varying degrees;
tbe amount taken up by vegetation; also,
in computing the value of water that Is
finally determined to be lost, the price of
water must be averaged. In some places
the price of m miner's inch of water Is
higher than in other sections. It will be ,
possible to get a fair average price, and '
the. miner's Inch will be the basis of mak
i!,g up. the valuation of the lost water.
When the number of millions of dollars
wasted can be shown, some of the advo
cates of saving the water think it will be
easy to demonstrate to all persons who
lend money upon the basis of rural realty;
and especially th, bankers, that saving
the water would be a good investment.
fcolely from the standpoint of insuring the
ability of the borrowers of money in the
country to repay the principal and the in- !
terest of loans.
The Government has gathered statistics
concerning the annual escape of flood
water from the Ohio and the Missis
rivers, and the figures are surprising. The
California problem will have to be figured
out on a somewhat different basis. The
cost of restraining the flood waters and
the money to be earned, on the average,
by having a supply of water that will per
mit the regular irrigation of vast tracts
of land, without regard to the drvnt of
the season, will be included in the" compu
tation to be submitted.
Colonel John P. Irish says that the dif
ference between irrigation and the lack of
irrigation was Illustrated fully last year.
The San Joaquin Valley, owing to the
scanty rain of the preceding winter, had
a very small crop. Placer County, on the
other hand, had a full crop of fruit, be
cause the South Yuba C mpany had the
Fordycc reservoir full of water" that had
been stored. When the South Yuba ditch
ran dry the company turned in the
water from the reservoir, and the people
had all the water they needed and the
orchards were correspondingly fruitful.
That demonstrated what could be done,
Most of the people of Placer County had
forgotten that â¢here was such a "water
supply In the reservoir until the emer
gency due to the dry season made it
necessary to draw upon it.

BREAKFAST ON DRINK.
Coffee Makes Many Dyspeptics.
"CoffÂ«v? and I had quite a tussle. Two
years ago I was advised by the doctor
to quit the use of coffee, for I had a
chronic case of dyspepsia and serious
nervous troubles, which did not yield
to treatment. I was so addicted to eof- j

quit, but when I was put on Postum !

"One of the lady teachers in our pub- ;

her to try leaving off the coffee and

nothing but Postum Food Coffee, and

The preliminary examination of Charles
H. Richardson, saloon-keeper, 548 How
ard street, charged with the murder of
his wife, was commenced before Judge
lonian v-esterday, but the only witness

DUSKY QUEENS
IN A NEW ROLE
AT THE ORPHEUM
IT was a long time ago that Solomon 'â 
said there was nothing new under the
sun. Since then the Hawaiian Queens
have appeared.
Orpheum patrons until this week have
asked the wherefore of their name. The!
Queens have at last explained by pre- j
senting "King Moo's Wedding Day."
It takes a good opera glass to convince
one that these are the same three who j
last week tripped forth Frenchlly, as ;
daintily artificial as Louis XIV fan pic- j
tures should be. Now they are dusky of j
cheek, red of mouth and lithe of limb. j
They love and they hate and they are j
beautiful, warm barbarians. .
The second place of honor falls to the i
Florcnz troupe of acrobats. There is a
happy family spirit apparent among them
that makes their work more cheerful than
l the average performance of that class.
I There Is no nervous, impending music to
lead up to great feats; they do wonders !
on each other's shoulders in a casual way
and come right side up again in a twink- |
ling with a "How-dy-di expression.
Then off they go after a grand lobbing i
and hopping all over the stageâ lt looks .â¢
for all the world like a frog festival.
Mr and Mrs. Harold Haskins present
what they call a "legitimate comedy." â¢
The legitimate is an elastic affair. The
Homeos and the Parthenias like to dis
tinguish themselves from Amelia Bing
ham and Rose Coghlan by claiming legiti- :
ma< v. and they In turn wave the word over
the heads of vaudeville stars, and now
come the Harold Haskinses to stalk supe
rior to ethers on the same boards. But |
their farce is a roaring funny one when j
seen for the first time, and you laughed | '
at It last night, be you young or be you
old, even though to-day's sober judgment j
frown at the folly.
The rest of the programme is made up of j ,
last week's holdovers and some fairly; '
good new turns. Little Elsie dances and j
imitates with wiry black arms dangling
in shoulder gloves. She is less fat and
comfy looking than the other stage babies !
who have been descending of late days
upon the town; but then she Is more
clever than most of them. Doing a
prodigy turn is warranted to reduce
weight. Try It.
SARAH COMSTOCK.
Nance O'Neil in "The Jewess."
If a tragedienne desires to test the full
capacity of her dramatic temperament let ;
her appear in the "curse scene" of "The
Jewess" and she will have every oppor- j
tunity to prove whether she is endowed
with versatility. In this part of the drama j
the actress is called upon to Interpret a
variety of emotions, the contrast and |
fervor of which demand the keenest ap
preciation of dramatic climaxes. Hence
it is this very scene which seals the fate
of that woman who desires to be regarded
as a good "Jewess." If she fails here
then all her activity in the balance of the
play becomes futile.
Nance O'Neil seems to dissect the lines. j
She knows every iota of their import,
and what is more she is aware of the |
uniqueness of the Jewish character. She i
does not only portray the emotions of the
woman, the love and hate of th" deserted
one, but she pictures accurately the j
despair of the faithless child who has j
wandered from the straight path of her
religion, her people, her nation, for a
man whom she thinks unworthy of such
sacrifice. Her despair 13 pictured In her i
features, her tears are not affected, her
hate is fierce and her curse springs from
her lips with the piercing anguish of a
soul In torture. She acts her part In a
manner which entrances the audience and
rivets its attention until the curtain drops.
No wonder that five curtain calls re
warded her for her splendid work.
However. Edwin Mordant is not a fit
leading man for such a virile actress as
Nance O'Neil. He may be well enough
as a juvenile In a passably good society j
play, but ho Is certainly out of place In
a drama like "The Jewess." His voice is !
not endowed with sufficient dramatic tim- â 
bre, nor does his deportment exhibit suf- ;
ficient force. The contrast between him I
and the tragedienne is too great to be
; passed by unnoticed.
j Stage children art generally swallowed
up in a play of this sort, but little Anita
! Loos did her part so unaffectedly and
with such natural grace that it "would
be a pity to deprive her of the credit due
her. A stage child who is really child
like in a play is a rarity, but Anita may
be classed among these exceptions. "The
Jewess will be repeated this evening.
ALFRED METZGER.
WIFE- BEATER PUNISHED.
William Fleming, a Coal Carter, Sent
to the County Jail for Four
Months.
William Fleming, river of a coal
wagon, living at 60&-4 Clementina street,
appeared before Judge Treadwell yester
day on a charge of battery upon his
wife. She was In court and had a pair
of blackened eyes and her face was
otherwise bruised and swollen. After
testifying to the assault she begged the
Judge to be lenient with her husband as
she had five young children and had no
means of supporting them.
The Judge said that he could not allow
such a brute to go free and he was
sorry that the law did not empower him
to give him 500 lashes and compel him
to keep sober and support his wife and
children. He sentenced him to four
months in the County Jail and gave Mrs.
Fleming a $5 goldplece to buy provisions
for herself and children and promised
to take her to the Associated Charities,
so that she could be looked after during
her husband's incarceration.
Bonds Insufficient.
The bonds accepted by Judge Treadwell
and Clerk Rice of Judge Conlan's court
for the release of Harry Walters, Henry
Roberts and James West, three bunko
men charged with swindling William
Schneider of Honolulu out of $105, were
declared Insufficient by Bond Expert New
man yesterday, and the three men were
ordered Into custody by Judge Mogan. The
bondsmen were Milo Waldron, saloon
keeper. 914 Market street, and James Til
ton, saloon-keeper, 1001 Market street.
Charles Crawford, the other bunko man
arrested, had the charge of grand larceny
against him dismissed by Judge Mogan, as
Schneider Called to Identify him, but he
is still held on the charge of vagrancy. '
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1599.
CANADA SHUT OUT
FROM TIDE WATER
Text of the Agreement
as to. Alaska.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 13.
--considerable gratification is felt in ad
ministration circles at the announcement
made by Sir Louis Davies that Canada
has agreed to the arrangement establish
ing a temporary boundary line between
the Dominion and Alaska determined on
by Secretary Hay and Mr. Tower several
weeks ago.
No official confirmation of Sir Louis
Davies' statement was received by the
State Department up to the close of of
fice hours this afternoon. Nevertheless
advices received by the authorities dur
ing the past few days convince them that
he has been correctly quoted, and that
the modus Vivendi has been agreed upon.
It has been practically settled for sev
eral weeks, but there remained some
minor matter of detail to be perfected,
and their discussion has delayed final
agreement.
- As it will be signed, the modus vlvendl
will provide that a temporary boundary
line shad be drawn from the connecting
Canadian custom-house at White Pass
and Chllkoot Pass. The line shall then
be traced southward to a mountain peak
about a mile and a half northwest of the
Indian village of Kuckwan. That line
shall determine the beginning and end of
the authority of the two governments
over their respective territory, and It
shall not prejudice any claim either may
have to territory on either side of the line
outside of such expressed authority. The
rights of private individuals shall not be
prejudiced ln consequence of their loca
tion either in American or British terri-
tory.
The modus vlvendl, Intended specifically
to prevent a conflict of authority between
the constabulary of the two governments
and strife between the citizens of the
United States and the subjects of Great
Britain shall continue in force until a
treaty is negotiated determining a perma
nent boundary.
By this agreement Canada will be ex
cluded from tidewater arid all her goods
sent to the Dominion from the Pacific
must pass through American territory.
She will have no outlet on Lynn canal and
the location of the line above Kluckwan
places her out of reach of even canoe nav
igation. The matter of permitting a Ca
nadian warehouse at tidewater and the
transit of goods to the Dominion over
American territory has no place in the
negotiations relating to the temporary
boundary line and ls a subject of separate
discussion. - .â¢ .-:â¢. â¢â¢ ;
The establishment of the modus vlvendl
shows how carefully Secretary Hay has
safeguarded the Interests of this country'
and especially the Pacific Coast.
SUISSER'S PLEA

Slayer of Sheriff Farley
in Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS. Oct. 13. âAt 10 O'clock this
morning the Superior courtroom was
crowded by citizens of Salinas, who as
sembled to be present when the murderer
of Sheriff Farley should be brought Into
court. At the appointed time Sheriff Keef
ushered George Suisser Into the court
room, and as he entered he cast one nerv
ous glance at the spectators and then
hurriedly took a seat in the prisoners'
dock. I'pon Judge Dorn calling the case
C. A. O Dell, attorney for {he prisoner,
made a strong plea to be allowed until
Monday for bis client to plead, but on
his falling to give satisfactory reasons for
a continuance the Judge Instructed that
the plea would be taken at ! o'clock this
afternoon whether the attorney was ready
or not, and continued the case to tlrat
time.
At 2 o'clock the courtroom was again
crowded to hear what plea the assassin
would make. As Sheriff Keef conducted
him to his seat he walked with more forti
tude than in the morning, and entered a
plea of not guilty. The trial was set fur
Tuesday.

SCHNEIDER AND
CUIGNET FIGHT
Due! Resulting From the
Dreyfus Case.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
[ LONDON, Oct. 13.â A dispatch from
| Paris says that a representative of the
i Intransigeant, M. Rochefort's paper, as
serts that while seeing a friend off on the
Orient express last evening he observed
Colonel Schneider, former military at
tache of the Austro-Hungarian Embassy
at Paris, being carried to the train, ac
companied by physicians, and with blood
j flowing from a wound In his side. Colonel
Schneider said: : . â ;
"I recently returned from Switzerland
i to fight a duel with Captain Cuignet on
account of hi-" evidence before- the Rennes
j court-martial."
j Captain Cuignet, ln the course of his
! evidence at Rennes in the second trial of
; Dreyfus, referred to a dispatch of Colonel
: Schneider, denouncing as a forgery a let
| ter purporting to have been written by
! him in which he was represented as al
i luding to efforts made by the German and
I Italian military attaches to conceal their
j relations with Dreyfus. This allegation
' of forgery Captain Cuignet ridiculed, de
i claring tnat if Colonel Schneider per
sisted in his attitude the French general
staff was in a position to prove beyond
i dispute the authenticity of the letter
which Schneider had repudiated. He then
added:
"The author of the letter Is, I know, of
very inferior position as compared with
his friends (Schwartzkoppen and Panlz
zardl). Perhaps he cannot do otherwise
than deny this. But he must know that
his letter is not the only one of his com
munications now ln our hands."
BIGAMIST ROBERTS
VISITING BROOKLYN
Congressman-Elect Declares He Vio
lates No Law in Maintaining
Three Households.
NEW YORK. Oct. 13.âCongressman
elect Brigham Henry Roberts from Salt
j Lake City, who is in Brooklyn, came East
over a week ago on a private visit. He
1 will remain about a week longer and then
| go to Philadelphia and probably to Wash
ington. Speaking to a reporter he said
: there was no indictment against him when
i he left Utah that he, knew of, nor did he
! know there was now an indictment. He
had broken no law, he said. That he had
a plurality of wives was true, but he had
married them before the manifesto of lS'.'O.
There had been no plural marriages since
i then, nor would there be any. Any in
| fringement of the statute would be discip
lined by the church as quickly as by the
laws of" the land.
Mr. Roberts said his visit to Brooklyn
I was merely a friendly one to the people of
his own religious faith. They were here
' to preach the gospel, and did not desire to
! be brought into any controversy which
might affect him.
Speaking of Ids election to Congress he
said it had been accomplished independ
ently of the church, as he had received
: the "greater number of votes from Gen
; tiles, and it had been an election by the
people. He had no fear about facing
Congress nor any misgiving in regard to
j the outcome of the situation.
DOMINICANS RELEASED
FROM CUBAN PRISON
Denounce Their - Imprisonment as
Worse Than Any Spanish
Outrage.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Oct. 13.â A party
of thirty-two Dominicans, who had been
confined at Baracoa for two months, were
released yesterday and arrived here to
day. They were members of the Jlmenes
expedition, which was captured because
its object was not concealed, as the mem
bers had been assured that the Americans
were favorable to their movement.
The two months spent in Jail have had
a terrible effect upon the party. One of
the members is dead and several have be
come Invalids.
The Dominicans are very bitter against
the Americans and declare that their Im
prisonment was worse than any Spanish
outrage. General Wood frequently recom
mended that they be released.. but the au
thorities at Havana prohibited such ac
tion.
Mysterious Death.

cisco, where an uncle resides, and to have
bet a member of the Utah battery in
the Philippine campaign. Coroner Mc-
Mullln will hold at) Inquest to-morrow

EASTERN MARKET
l\ew row stock Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 13.â The temper of specu
lation was determinedly bearish to-day and
favorable incidents were persistently ignored.
The reactionary spirit found Its chief vent by
selling Brooklyn Transit. That stock was the
leader of the market in point of activity, and
although the dealings lid not approach the
high-water mark of a few weeks ago the un
bupportt-d condition of the stock and the large
blocks offered Â«ug|-estcd a resumption of late
conditions. Metropolitan Street Railway r.cemed
to show acute sympathy. Manhattan was lit
tle affected and the New York Gas stocks were
firm. There were some wide movements in
stocks not usually prominent. New York Air
Brake fell nine points and the Flower group
as a whole, except Rock Island, was weak in
sympathy with Brookly Transit. Offerings of
Sugar and Tobacco were greater than could
bo absorbed and both stocks declined sharply.
The American Malting stocks also were de
pressed, the common losing 2*4 and preferred
7 per cent. The industrials were more affected
than the railways. Laclede â¢ Gas rose con
spicuously 4 points and Great Northern pre
ferred over a point.
The market .seemed rather firm for a time
during the morning and the persistent weak
ness of Brooklyn Transit broke through the
resistance. Call loans were easier again, the
maximum rate not exceeding 64 per cent,
the majority of tha day's loans being made at
1
5 per cent or below. Preliminary estimates of
the week's movements of money give prospect
of a slightly improved condition in to-morrow's
bank statement. The disbursements of cash
by the sub-treasury on account of Government
payments have almost offset its receipts on ac
count of revenues. Put the banks have de
posited at the sub-treasury for telegraphic
transfer to the interior $1,052,000. The heavy
outward movement early in the week has been
partly offset by. large receipts later in the
week. This would Indicate a loss In the in
terior movement of about $2,500,000. Against
this there have been receipts of $2,800,000 of
foreign gold and about $750,000 by cashing of
drafts on the San Francisco mint by the sub
treasury, making a total of about $3,550,000.
This would indicate a net gain to the cash
reserves of the bank of over $1,000,000. The
banks further reduced their loans so there ls
a fair prospect of an increase ln the surplus.
The first payment of anticipated interest on
Government bends will be made on Monday.
But the prospects do not indicate that applica
tion will be male on a large scale, although
this payment Is without rebate. The bond
market was moderately active, but price
changes were mixed. Total sales, par value,
$1,761
United States 3s declined 4 and new 4s ad
vanced 4 in the bid price.

NEW YORK. Oct. 13.- The : Commercial Ad

They opened irregular, but soon improved
quickly up to the close. African mines were
buoyant. Portuguese threes were again hard.
Spanish fours were 604, Tint is 4.. and Ana
condas a shade under 10. f ;Â».--'
American securities began dull and remained
listless to the close, which -was slack. The.
Cape took Â£300.000 gold and; South America
Â£12,000. Meanwhile the bank bought gold to the
amount of Â£183,000, as follows: i Â£90,000 in bars,
Â£75.000 in German coin and Â£!S,OOO in French
coin. The loss to the Cape was less than had
been expected, th" market counting on an en
gagement of Â£600,000. It Is expected that the
Cape will take half a million Sterling a week
during the war.
Money was slack on the release of Govern
ment dividend, calls being gui"! and bills easy,
the latter, however, only temporarily. Silver
was firm on the home coinage order.

I Bradstrcct's Financial Review.
â¢ , L ; ,
NEW YORK. Oct Bradrtreet's will ay
to-morrow ln its review of the New York
stock market:
The announcement of the Treasury's readi
ness to anticipate all Its Interest 1 , payments for
the current fiscal year contrituied, with small
outside demands for funds and a decreased
pressure for loans on the part of Wall street
Itself, to give the call money market an easy
tone. The. other important development was,
of course, the Transvaal Government's ulti
matum and the. bringing of British and
Boers to open war. The improvement in our
own money market failed, however, to stimu
late speculative activity or to support prices
materially. .The, market continued to be dull,
devoid of outside participation and subject to
professional manipulation for the bear ac
count. In fact, as money became easier these
seemed to be less strength and more aggres
siveness on the part of the bears, leading on
Thursday to an increased downward tendency
in prices, followed en Friday by an increase
of such pressure. There has been no particu
lar evidence of liquidation and the excellent
railroad earnings, the disposition and ability
of the companies to advance rates as well as
the continued activity and prosperity ln the
steel, coal and other industries with which
all street keeps in touch and on which some
of its speculative material is based, produce
a good impression, but mainly as to the fu
ture of prices. For the present the money
market outweighs all other considerations and
the speculative community is possibly not as
fully disposed to exaggerate the bad features
of the financial situation, as it seemed some
weeks ago to ignore such dangers. Declin
ing prices in the face of an improvement in
the tendencies of the New York loan mar
ket and an apparent growth of bearish feel
ing here when London displayed a recovery
in prices and a sense of relief that the un
certainty that the Transvaal situation had
culminated, even If the outcome is war, cer
tainly seems anomalous. But the Inability of
our market to respond may be ln a measure
traced to the fact that unless the Transvaal
war is quickly ended grave disturbances in the
speculative and financial markets abroad
might after all ensue. While money ls easier
in London it has not fallen to the point
where gold can be taken for shipment to
New York. In fact, the Bank of England
will certainly oppose such a movement now.
Large interests here seem unwilling to take
a bullish position in the market while money
is liable to jump to 7 (a 15 per cent should the
market develop any activity and when gold
can neither be imported nor can the return
flow of money taken from New York force
crops moving and business purposes be yet
discerned. The public is also impressed with
the same ideas and a large part of it is
so fully and profitably employed with its own
legitimate concerns that the outside participa
tion in the street is seriously curtailed there
by. The market has, therefore, developed a
growing disposition to wait until the progress
of the South African war affords some idea
of its outcome and duration and until the un
locking of money from the Treasury or the re
ceipts of gold from Europe and currency from
the Interior checks the depletion of the New
York bank reserves and ends the calling of
loans which has been in progress for some
weeks past. This halt in the market and the
insensiblity to th. plentiful favorable facts in
the, situation have naturally led to bearlshness
among the traders and to manipulation de
signed to put prices down.
Bfadstreet's on Trade.
(NEW YORK Oct. 13.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: Trade activity is widespread, all
measures of volume and value testifying to
prevailing prosperous conditions. Only good
reports are received from distributive trad
centers and some markets report fall demand
as holding out longer than expected. Rail
; way earnings, bank clearings returns and
! quotations of staple prices are all encouraging,
pointing as they do to a maximum volume of
business for this period of the year. Crop
returns for October bear out earlier impres
sions of shortened yields of most leading agri
cultural products. Expectation of more mod
erate yields of leading cereals is not confined
to this country, The world's wheat crop will
admittedly be smaller and the yields of rye,
barley and oats are not expected to be bo large
as a year ago. The higher range of prices
of ail staples and particularly of agricultural
products, however, will furnish a profitable
balance to producers. The advance in the
price of cotton has been a notable one ami
though some react n is naturally noted the
effects upon general Southern trade and in
j dustry following the advance are particularly
â  beneficial, as this section alone has appeared
to lag somewhat behind the process of pros
i perity.
In the manufacturing branch of trade
! strength is well nigh universal. Advances
i have been numerous and a scarcity of goods
! rather than of demand is the main subject of
i complaint. While a source of depression to
cotton, the Transvaal situation has proved
rather favoiable to wheat and other cereals,
offsetting heavy increases In the visible sup
pile.-.
The liberality of foreign demand is perhaps
; best known in the September report of ex
â¢ ports of leading products. Shipments of bread
: stuffs wen; as large as those of August and
' there was naturally a heavy gain in cotton
exports, which are double those of the same
month a year ago. Totals of leading exports
show an Increase of 23 per cent over Septem
ber a year ago and over September, 1896, but
a decrease of 8.5 per cent from September, 1897,
which witnessed very heavy shipments of
breadstuff?.
The general manufacturing industry is run
' ning full and activity is so widespread
i that It Is hard to prefer one industry to an
other In th:.- respect. Coal production is par
' Ocularly heavy, but a scarcity of cars is com.
! plained of in this and in the coke Industry,
; with the strength of lake freights constitut
ing a disturbing element as regards the sup
| ply of anthracite In the West. Iron and steel
| are active as to production, but new business
; is limited by the small quantities available
1 for near-by delivery. Liberal orders are still
reported for the first half of. next year and
steel rails are reported tending upward at the
; West. "â ' --:.-:

Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK. Oct. 13.-R. G. Dun & Co.
weekly review of trade, which issues to-mor
row, will say:
Industrial conditions could hardly be better.
After months of such extraordinary buying
that its continuance seemed Impossible, even
Larger buying still crowds producing works In
most lines beyond their capacity. The iron fur
naces arc producing 1000 tons weekly more than
ever before. 278.615 tons October 1, and yet the
actual consumption in manufacture reduced un
sold stocks In September by 27.380 tons, while
the demand runs far ahead into next year for
many products. After the great buying last
week Bessemer pig rises to $24 at Pittsburg,
with No 1 Anthracite at Philadelphia and No.
1 local coke at Chicago, both quoted at $23 50,
and buyers paying premiums for early deliv
eries according to their needs. Finished prod
ucts still advance. Eastern bar to $2 15 and tank
plates to $3 10. and the average of percentages
to prices of January 1, ISS7. is now 100.64 for
finished products and 105.7 for pig. In some
lines, however, production has so far gained
that works are beginning to look for orders to
cover next year. : â' : , '
The boot and shoe shops are getting a little
better prices for men's kip boots and for
women's grain and buff shoes, and shipments
for the first half of October are the largest
ever reported, though oi-ders for next season
are retarded by prices. Leather ls a shade
higher, but buying of sole has been checked by
the recent advance, as manufacturers appear to
have rather large supplies, and the Chicago
market for hides, though quoted a little high
er, seems uncertain. The demand for woolen
goods is fairly large and prices are well sus
tained, though not further advanced. In goods
of the better grades there Is some uncertainty.
Sales of wool are smaller, only 7.743.300 pounds
for the week at the three markets, without
further advance.
Silks are firm and linens tending upward with
good demand.
The cotton manufacture meets so great a de
mand that prices advance every week and sup- J
piles for early delivery are In many lines re
stricted. More business Is turned down than
is done in brown sheetings and drills and
coarse colored cottons are rising. Big sales
have moved a great deal of the surplus print
cloths, and prices have been advanced for
some grades. The rise of about lc in cot
ton, with current reports of short yield, has
much Influence, and though the quantity com
ing into sight is larger to date than last year,
it has recently been falling behind enough to
support the idea that growers arc disposed to
hold It back.
Wheat exports are still larger than from the
great crop of last year. Atlantic flour included,
having been 7.351.990 bushels in . two weeks,
against 6.116.659 last year, and Pacific. 730,440
bushels, against 1,735,430 last year. The West
ern receipts have been only 14,518.892 bushels,
against 20.790,495 last. year, but the course of
prices is not calculated to encourage a big
movement, for after starting at 75.37 cents and
falling to 75 cents, the market closed at 75c.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Oct. 13.â Wheat opened easy fol
lowing indifferent foreign markets and large
Argentine shipments. The demand was light
and me generous short-selling soon started
the market on the down-grade. About the
middle of the session a report of damage by
drought and insects to the new crop in the
Southwest caused slight rallies, but the mar
ket was soon weighed down again by a re
sumption of short selling anel liquidation, In
duced by steadily increasing stocks all over
the world. There was a Blight upturn near
the close on buying by shorts, who put out
several long lines of Wheat on the early bulges
and took advantage of the decline to buy In
and secure profits, and the market closed with
buyers in the majority. December opened a
shade lower at 72 : _'ii724c, declined to 724 c, rose
to 724 c, sold off again to 72c and closed with
buyers at* 72',c.
Corn ruled active and strong early-, influenced
by higher cables and excellent cash demand.
Liquidation and sympathy with Wheat caused
it to turn weak. December closed at 314 c.
its ruled dull and lower in sympathy with
Wheat and Corn. Longs sold freely. Decem
ber closed at 23c.

the decline was fully recovered before the

greater than packers were Inclined to 1111 at

"During the week there have been four deliv

three from British Columbia, 9634 tons; one
from Oregon. 600 tons; one from Japan, 3700
tons; total. 26989 tons. Our colliery proprietors
are pushing their steamers to their utmost cap
acity, and ere beating records in making fast
time in their deliveries here. The outlook is
improving for our winter supply of fuel, al
though there may not at any time be an ox'er
supply on md, there will be sufficient for cur
rent requirements. There are unfounded ru
mors on the street, which have been repeated
in the papers, that an advance was shortly to
be made on domestic grades for the winter
months. These statements are made to alarm
consumers and force them to lay in large
stocks, whereas at present there is no such in
tention. Present prices will rule for the next
six monthr.
"Freights from foreign ports are hardening,
which means light shipments of coal for several
months to come. Hawaiian Islands are secur
ing all the Australian tonnage for fully eight
months ahead, so that the entire fuel trade is
drifting into the hands of the northern col
lieries,. The transports are relieving us of a
large amount of steam coal, and now that there
is such a Â«cant quantity on hand at Honolulu
i the steamers leaving here are filling their bunk

A SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE.
Young People of Mission Churches j
Produce a Charming Operetta.
The operetta "Golden Hair and the I
Three Bears" was produced last evening I
at ilinman Hall, Twenty-first and Mis- j
sion streets, by the young people of the |
Mission churches. The "fair was under j
'theT Ladies' ; ;. Auxiliary of the Mission j
branch of the Young Men's Christian As- j
socJation, and its purpose was to raise
funds to furnish the auxiliary's new quar
tors at 7 and 11 Hill street.
The performance was one of exceptional '.
merit, and Mrs. L. Straub. who had j
charge of the rehearsals, deserves much j
credit for the excellent manner in which i
the young participants acquitted them- j
selves'. The operetta developed a youth- "
ful prodigy in the person of little Miss I
Adelaide Killgore, who sang the part of
Qolden Hair. She is scarcely 12 years old, !
yet possesses a rich contralto voice that !
was a surprise to every one who heard
her sing. She handled her voice like a
veteran and acted her part like a profes- !
Elonal. All who took part deserve praise i
for their excellent work. The chorus of I
fifty little tots was a feature of the per
form;,

ATHLETES OF WEST
OAKLAND PROSPER
OAKLAND, Oct. IS.â Athletics are to be boomed in West Oakland. The
West Oakland Athletic Club has just received its certificate of Incor
poration from Sacramento, and is now prepared to enter upon an active
career. Nearly a year ago the club was originally created, but It has
rapidly outgrown the anticipations of Its founders, who have found it
necessary to place it on a substantial footing. ; ' â 
George W. Bastian has been elected president, which office he filled before
the Incorporation. The other officers are: Frank Simpson, first vice president;
C. L. Wines, treasurer; Frank Hufschmidt, secretary. George Simpson, who
ls to box twenty rounds with Charley Tye at the Acme Club next week, is
the boxing instructor, and Charles (onion has been engaged for instructor
in wrestling. The directors are: James Drew, George Simpson, William Hal
loran. Silas Lumsden. Al Fie!.. William Duphrau, E. W. Kuster, George W.
Bastian, Frank Simpson, C. L. Wines and Fred Hufschmidt.
The club has a membership of seventy-five, and ten new applications were
received at the last meeting. The clubrooms are well fitted up, and it has
been found that the. rooms can be well equipped and maintained by levying
dues at $1 per month. At the present time the club is entirely out of debt and
has $400 in its treasury-
In addition to the athletic features the social side of club life has not
been neglected, and there are also well-supplied music and card rooms.
Wednesday and Friday have been set apart as class nights, and there are al
ways about thirty members stripped, ready for tuition, on these occasions. In
the near future the club will present some fine athletic programmes.

FOR A BRANCH MUSEUM.
Merchants' Association to Establish
a Permanent Exhibit Here.
Several months ago The Call announced
that the Merchants' Association of this
city proposed to establish in San Fran
cisco a branch of the Philadelphia Com
mercial Museum. Manager Wilson of the
Eastern body promised to donate to the
Western branch many of the exhibits, of
which there is a surplus. A number of
the members of the local body have been
East, and their investigation of the mat
ter has led them to become enthusiasti
cally favorable to the project. This Inter
est is shown by the following, which ap
pears In the forthcoming issue of the Re
view, the official organ of the associa
tion:
The Philadelphia Commercial Mu
seum is now holding a magnificent x
position, that has excited the atten
tion and admiration of every commer
cial center of the world. The products
of all lands are extensively repre
sented there. So successful and valu
able has the Philadelphia Commercial
Museum proven that other prominent
cities are about to start similar In
stitutions. Not to be outdone by Phil
adelphia, the Merchants' Association
of New York has decided to in
augurate In the metropolis a perma
r.ent commercial museum upon a still
more extensive scale. Considerable
correspondence has been exchanged
between our association and the Phila
delphia Commercial Museum upon the
establishment of a branch museum In
San Francisco. Many convincing ar
guments favor such an enterprise ln
this Western metropolis. Its peculiar
advantages to our merchants and
manufacturers, particularly in view of
thi- opening of Oriental markets,
should bring about the establishment
of a San Francisco Commercial Mu
seum at an early date. Every mer
cantile and commercial organization
should unite In consummating this in
dispensable institution for trade ex
pansion.
POKED HIS EYE OUT.
William Taylor Uses the Point of an
Umbrella With Disastrous
Result. *
William Taylor, a colored man 21 years
of age, was arrested yesterday morning
and booked at the City Prison on a
charge of mayhem. The complaining
witness is J. J. Tompkins, a horse
trainer from Chicago, living at the
Golden Gate Hotel.
Tompkins was standing outside the ho
tel shortly after midnight talking to
friends when Taylor approached them
and began to talk to them. Tompkins
told him to go away, and when Taylor
asked why Tompkins , replied: "Don't
like niggers, nohow." Taylor had an
umbrella in his hand and made a lunge
with It at Tompkins" face and the point
struck his left eye.
Tompkins was taken to the Receiving
Hospital and Dr. Dray attended the in
jured eye. He said that the night was
entirely gone.

Coroner Hill held an Inquest yesterday
upon the body of Martin Shaughnessy.
who died ln St. Mary's Hospital on Octo

ployer. The apparatus for shifting the
belt was out of order and could not be
used, and Shaughnessy was obliged to use
the stick instead. i

ALAMEDA COUNTY
TO PRISON FOR
A YEAR BECAUSE
OF THIRTY CENTS
Yon Kapff a Victim of
Fee System.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call.
DOS Broadway. Oct. 13.
Henry W. yon Kapff, ex-constable of
Alameda, who was recently convicted of
having sworn falsely to affidavits at
tached to his claims for fees, was sen
tenced by Judge Hall to-day to one year's
Imprisonment in San Quentln. a motion
for a new trial having been previously de
nied. By stipulation it was agreed that
the making out of the commitment be de
ferred for another week to give Yon Kapff
time in which to appeal to the Supreme
Court, but it is believed that he does not
desire to appeal. /> .
Before pronouncing sentence Judge Hall
took occasion to criticize the system of
paying fees to petty officers. He noted
the fact that Yon Kapff while in offlce had
about fifteen deputies.
"This number.'' said his Honor, "was
not required to attend to the ordinary
business that could come to his offlce, and
consequently it was hard for deputies to
make fees. The result is that the young
man finds himself in this court as a con
vict, having perjured himself for a few
dimes."
Yon Kapff. who at one time was one of
the most popular young men in Alameda,
appeared crestfallen when sentence was
pronounced. He feels bitterly the stigma
that the proceedings attach to his name.
HENRY W. YON KAPFF.
and he still protests his Innocence.
"I am an innocent victim of circum
stances," he said as he once more entered
1 the prison corridor. "I think the verdict
] of the jury an unjust one. as I never in
tentionally violated any law. Even the
I Judge remarked that there was no real i
; criminal Intent, but the jury rendered its |
; verdict otherwise, and his Honor gave me
the minimum sentence. I believe. It's a
case of punishing a man on general prin
ciplesâthat constables In this county have
held up the treasury for years past.
"I'm convicted of overcharging the
county the exorbitant sum of 30 cents.
Whether deliberately or otherwise, I j
overcharged this amount', and this, too,
during a period of four years in offlce. ;
The presumption is great that a man
with no stain upon his character, having
a young wife, an aged father and mother
and sisters to mourn his loss, would not
deliberately commit suicide, so to speak,
for this great amount of money. -It seems
to me that It Is a constable that they
wanted to punish, no matter what his
name, and in the drawing of straws,
which I had no hand In, I'm the one that |
ls to die." ___

chased Mr. William from an unknown dealer. The goat was frisky and ap
peared to be a very lively animal. In fact. It tried to use Its horns on the
way to the Carter home. Mr. Carter paid $2 for the goat and two hours
after he bought It William died. Mr. Carter seriously Informed the prosecut
ing attorney that $1 per hour for '.he possession of a goat was direct fraud
and he asked for the assistance of a police officer and a John Doe ** arrant
to go and secure the arrest of the goat merchant. Attorney Samuels uejllncd
to issue. the warrant, stating that In his opinion buying goats was something
like swapping horsesâ you have to take your chance. Mr. Carter left the

a goat.

TROUT WERE POISONED
OR ELSE ELECTROCUTED
OAKLAND, Oct. Three hundred !
dead speckled trout are floating on the
beautiful lake in the Schilling grounds.
Two days ago all the fish were lively,
but the next morning all were dead. Mr.
Schilling is at a loss to account for the
death of his fish and at firs', thought that
some poison must have been thrown Into
the pond. The Schilling grounds, how
ever, are always open to the public ex
cept at auch times as Mr. Schilling de
sires to keep them private, and no one
can conceive of any reason why a vandal
should wish to poison the beautiful fish.
It Is possible that a livÂ«- electric wire
may have got Into the pon- for the Schil
ling grounds are a perfei I network of
electric wires, used for ill' nlnatlng pur
poses. One of the trout ar- a sample if
the water from the pond h ye been given
to the analyst at the State University and
in a few days it will be ascertained
whether the fish died from poison or
whether the pond charged with electricity
caused the electrocution of the trout.

WIDOW CHARGES
THAT F. C. SIEBE.
DELUDED HER
Mrs. Petermann Files
a Queer Suit.
Oaklr ad Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Oct. 13.
A rather sensational suit was filed in
the Superior Court this afternoon by Mrs.
Mary Petermann of Mount Eden against
Fred C. Siebe of San Francisco, her de
ceased husband's former business part
ner, wherein she makes grave charges of
having been duped by him out of a con
siderable portion of the $100,000 estate left
to her and eight children by her husband.
Henry Peterraann, who died in April, 1891
The complaint recites that shortly after
the husband's death a son. Henry Peter
mann Jr., engaged In business and spec
ulative enterprises, borrowing large sums
from Siebe, in whom the widow had re
posed implicit confidence and who had
voluntarily offered his advice and counsel
pertaining to her property. Young Peter
mann sustained heavy losses and in 1894
was Indebted to Siebe for $15,000. Mrs.
Petermann, however, had no knowledge
of such transactions until Siebe presented
the notes to her for indorsement, long
after the same became due, but still hav
ing full confidence in Slebe's honesty, she
signed the notes, Siebe advising her that
it would not be necessary for her to con
sult an attorney In the matter.
Later, continues the complaint, and
while young Petermann was insolvent,
Siebe loaned $1000 more and took a note
for the same, which she never Indorsed,
and on October 2, 1896, defendant blandly
informed her that "she was now indebted
to him in the sum of $23,000 and that in
order to secure payment of the same it
would be necessary for her to execute
mortgages upon certain of her realty lv
favor of Siebe." She then executed two
mortgages, one for $20,000 on Alameda
County property and the other for $3000
on San Francisco property.
"All of which plaintiff alleges was dona
without any consideration and that de
fendant wickedly and falsely misrepre
sented to her that she owed him $23,000
for the purpose of defrauding and cheat
ing her out of her property."
Later Mrs. Petermann was prevailed
upon by Siebe to surrender control of her
property, so It appear in the complaint,
and finally, in April, 1896, she was pre
vailed upon to make a deed. The plain
tiff further alleges that in taking control
of her property Siebe also collected notes
she had against various parties for over
$20,000, none of which he gave her credit
for, and that on September 27, 1899, de
fendant claimed she owed him $34,637, and
requested a trust deed for all her prop
erty, threatening if she refused he would
foreclose the mortgages.
The widow asserts that she never owed
Siebe over $2000. She asks that the court
direct Siebe to render an accounting and
that the mortgages given by her to him
be declared null and void.

REALTY TORE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE
THE tone of the real .estate market
continues- to improve, and. brokers
almost without exception predict a
prosperous business for October.
There is plenty of money seeking invest
ment, and the only drawback now ls de
sirable offerings. Owners appear to be
unwilling to part with their holdings or
are asking too much for their properties.
Any one with a desirable piece of busi
ness property, improved or unimproved,
should have no difficulty in disposing of
the same at a fair figure. *:-.
Business has been fairly good during
the past week, although no new sales
involving large amounts have been re
ported. Confirmation has been received,
however, of several sales of goodly pro
portions heretofore referred to in these

Citizens will assemble at Metropolitan
Hall this evening to ratify the ticket
placed in the field by the Republican
Municipal Convention. Hon. Horace
Davis, the able and distinguished nominee
for Mayor, will address the meeting.
Other speakers of ability will also enter
tain and instruct the audience.
The Republicans enter the local contest
â¢with a firm determination to achieve suc
cess by appealing to the Intelligence and
civic patriotism of the great city of San
Francisco. Prominent men who have
hitherto paid but little attention to elec
tion contests other than those of national
character are coming forward at the pres

mote the success of the Republican mu
nicipal ticket as th means of securing
tjood government lor the residents of San

lot in life was cast ami ; the I tilers;
hence it is not singular that he Is a man
of human sympathies. He is not what
â¢ the rich and smart set would term a bril

truthful, possessing a fund of sound Com
mon sense useful to the city, and more
to bo prized in a public servant than
flashes of oratorical genius.
The Horace Davis Central Republican

preclate the fact that they I i+ve a laud

their ability to Win is hourly increasing.
The merchants are particularly active tn

day the finance committee of the cam
paign was organized. Fourteen leading
men of the city wire Invited to meet at
the office of Henry T. Scott on Market
street, and not a man whose services on
the committee were sought failed to re

less be contributed by the enterprising
taxpayers of the community. At the
meeting were: Irving M. Scott, George
... Newhall, John F. Merrill. W. H.
Crocker, P. N. LiHenthal. Colonel William
Macdonald, Mr. Sic-. of Miller, Sloss &
Pcott, and others. The committee elected
TV. li. Crocker treasurer.
The committee appointed by the Repub
lican convention to fill vacancies on the
ticket will meet to-day. Only two vacan
cies are to be filled. Mr. Koster, whose
name was placed on the ticket for Super
visor without his consent, declined to ac
cept for the reason that business affairs
would not Justify his acceptance. I. J.
Truman, treasurer, will be placed on the !
ticket, to fill the first vacancy. Joseph
Britton accepted a nomination bill de
cided after reflection to withdraw. When
he accepted he had not fully weighed the
proposition, but had simply "hefted" It
The story goes that Pheian persuaded
him to retire and wrote a letter which
lias since placed one or both in a bad
plight Emmet Barrett, a sterling man
of worth and character, will be placed on
the ticket to fill this vacancy. The com
mittee had a list of fifty acceptable men ]
for each place. Mr. Koster. whose dec
lination was regretted, is in full sympathy
with the Republican movement for reform
in municipal affairs and will give Horace
Davis earnest support
The new Republican County Com
mittee will meet at 723 Market street at
7:30 o'clock this evening and proceed to
the election of a chairman and secre
tary. The session will be brief, as the
members will desire to attend the rati
fication meeting at Metropolitan Hall.
Delegates Meakln, Kinno and Walsh,
comprising a committee from the People's
party convention, waited upon Senator R
Porter Ashe yesterday and urged him not
to decline the party's nomination for
Mayor. The Populists are confident of
polling a very large vote. It is claimed
that thousands of Democrats of the
Bryan following will not recognize the
McNab convention, but on the contrary
will acknowledge the People's party as
the regular Democratic organization.

SAN FRANCISCO WAS AT
THE MERCY OF THE IOWA
For the First Time in the History of the Port a Warship Clears for
Action*
FOR half an hour yesterday San Francisco lay at
the mercy of a ship-of-war. The big fighting ma
chine lowa was cleared for action and the shotted
guns were trained upon the city. The officers were
all at their posts, the range had been found, the
gunners stood to their guns, and all that was needed was
the word of command to lay the Queen City of the Pacific
in ruins. instead of the order to commence firing, how
ever, 'the cartridges were withdrawn from the guns, the
deck hamper was restored to its place, the lifeboats were
recalled to the ship and in an hour from the time prepara
tions began everything was going along on board the
warship as though such a thing as a sea fight had never
been heard of.
The boys on the lowa have not forgotten how to clear
their ship for action. The speed with which they got her
ready for a brush with the Spanish fleet was noted at the
time, but yesterday, in the piping days of peace, they
equaled if not excelled that record. Soon after breakfast
the order was given to put the ship in fighting trim. AH
the lifeboats and launches were sent over to the cruiser
Marblehead; the wire netting around the ship was taken
down; the bridge was removed; the big cranes that hoist
the steam launches inboard were lowered; the yard on the
pole that surmounts the fighting top was taken down and
stowed away, the fighting tops were manned, and in the
I the primaries with any delegates from his i
I own district, Senator Sammy Braunhart
took a large and conspicuous part in the ,
I evening's programme and was handed a
committee on rules of five members as hw
reward. Chairman McDonald promised
to submit the names at a future date.
Louis de F. Bartlett moved the appoint
ment of a campaign committee, one mem
ber to be selected from each Assembly ;
District. His motion carried and the'
chairman made a similar announcement
Then there were loud cries of "Popper.
"Popper," from the back of the hall, and
Max of that name got up to hand out a
few points on "How J would conduct this
campaign if I were younger." Mr. Pop
per's style and delivery had suffered noth
ing by long disuse and his speech was the
feature of the entertainment. In opening
he gracefully presented himself with sev
eral handsome floral designs and gave off
to his hearers the comforting assurance
that the coming campaign was to be thÂ«
easiest thing although the hardest that
Democracy ever got to windward of, and
that although already won every one
would have to fight hard to make the
campaign a success. Continuing, he said
that Horace Davis could not and should
not be elected, because he had never read
the funding bill, and he then pointed with
I pride to the fact that Mayor Pheian had
not only road it but sent telegrams to
every Congressman in Washington con
cerning it. Mr. Popper's suggestions were
received with loud applause, which was ,
only interrupted by a motion by some one
in the back of the hall to appoint a com
mittee of five to purge the Great Register j
"for the benefit of the party." The mover
offered no suggestions as to how this
scheme could be worked, so it was re- :
ferred to the campaign committee for con- i
sideration. Adjournment was taken to j
the call of the chair.
Citizens' Republican Party.
The County Committee of the Citizens' :
Republican party met at Foresters' build
ing, 102 O'Farrell street, last night and
perfected organization by the election of
Joseph E. Lee chairman and George li.
Pettis secretary. On motion the chairman
was authorized to appoint a campaign ;
committee and announce the same at the
meeting of the County Committee on
Thursday next. It was decided to open
headquarters and conduct the same dur- j
ing the present campaign.
MRS. KOPP MUST
BE TRIED OVER AGAIN
; The Jury Disagrees as to Her Guilt in
Shooting Her Husband â
to One for Acquittal.
The Jury in whose hands rested the fate
I of Mrs. Louisa Kopp, charged with man-
I slaughter for having shot her husband on
June 28 last, disagreed last night and was
discharged. it is understood that the
members stood eleven to one for acquittal.
Judge Ferral, Mrs. Kopp's .attorney,
managed by tact to work up an incident
; that doubtless wavered the jury In the
â¢ prisoner's favor. Mrs. Bertha Monti, the
woman who it is alleged was responsible
for tin; shooting of Kopp by reason of her
relations with him, was in the courtroom
and took a seat near the defendant. As
sistant District Attorney Greany, it was
expected, had concluded to call Mrs.
Monti as a witness in rebuttal to prove
that the allegation of her intimacy with
the dead was not based on fact. He failed
to call her, however, and after the case
had rested Judge Ferral stated that all
witnesses would now be excused. Mrs.
Monti kept her seat despite the fixed
stare of the attorney, and then Judge Fer
ial, seeing that she was not easily fright
ened, asked the court to read the order
allowing all witnesses to retire. Again
Judge Ferral turned and fixed his eyes on
Mrs. Monti and this time she lost her
nerve. Hastily rising from her seat she
fled the room and was not seen again. The
Incident caused considerable comment and
all in favor of the accused.

incredibly short space of half an hour there was nothing
left for the enemy to aim at but the armored hull, the
fighting mast and the smokestacks.
It took Just half an hour to get the battleship back
into her old condition, and then life went on aboard the
lowa as though nothing had happened. The men worked
like machines and there was not a hitch from the moment
the drill began until It was finished.
"The beauty of it all." said one of the officers, "Is that
the boys act just the same in a fight as they do in a drill.
There was no excitement when we were getting ready for
the work cut out for us off the coast of Cuba, and there
was no excitement to-day when we were clearing the
ship for action. The American sailor Is the greatest and
coolest fighting machine the world has ever seen."
The charing of the lowa for battle yesterday was the
first time in the history of the port that such a drill has
taken place. Hundreds of warships have lain peacefully
at anchor in the bay, but never before has one stowed all
the emblems of peace and taken on the visage of grim
war. Stripped of all her deck hamper, the lowa looked
what she isâ a terrible engine of destruction.
During the afternoon Major General Shafter paid a
friendly sit to the captain of the battleship. As It was
not an official event no salute was fired when the general
left the lowa.
ARNOLD MEYER KILLED
BY TOUCHING A LIVE WIRE
WHILE engaged In decorating
Market street ln honor of the
Golden Jubilee of the Odd Fel
lows, Arnold Meyer, ; aged 19
years, who was employed by
Charles Goldberg, a decorator at 624 Ellis
street, was almost Instantly killed last
evening by coming in contact with a live
wire. In his hurry to complete the deco
rations Meyer thoughtlessly grabbed the
death-dealing wire and received! a shock
that resulted In his death a few minutes
later. .', ;
Shortly before 6 o'clock, Meyer, with
two assistants, started to stretch a string
of flags across Market street, near Sixth.
The unfortunate young man entered the
building at 1007*_ Market street, and,
standing on the fire escape, he called to
his fellow workers to pass the 1 string of
flags to him. Ills object was to fasten one
end to the fire escape and the other to
the building on the opposite side; of the

The San Francisco Public School Teach
ers' Annuity and Retirement Society met
Arnold Meyer.
An examination of the body disclosed
that the index linger of the right hand
was badly burned by contact with the
deadly - iluid. There was also a severe
bruise on the side of the head, caused
by falling against the stairs of the fire
escape after receiving the shock.
Bruns, the dentist, was seated in his
office, which faces the fire escape, when
the accident happened.
"Meyer asked my permission to go
through my ofllce to reach the fire es
cape," he remarked when telling the
story cf the accident. "As I had no ob
jection he opened the window and climbed
on to the fire escape. His two assistants
quickly followed him, and while he as
cended the stairs of the fire escape they
remained on the lower platform, ready to
render any assistance he desired. Just as
he had fastened the string of flags to the
fire escape he suddenly threw up his
hands and uttering a piercing shriek fell
to the bottom, his head striking against
the Iron steps.
"We hurriedly picked him up and car
ried him into my offlce. A short time
afterward he dud."
Meyer, in addition to being a decorator,
was an extra man in the Fire Depart

LITTLE FELLED
COUNSEL WHO
OPPOSED HIM
Attorney Bowden Was
His Victim.
â â¢
ROW OVER DIVORCE SUIT
â¢
PLAINTIFF OBJECTED TO A
CHANGE OF VENUE.
â¦
Tbe Court Granted the Motion, How
ever, and He Lost His Temper
and Will Now Be
Arrested.
I The little matter of an argument for a
I change of venue in a divorce suit caused
| a large row outside of Judge Dainger
| field's court yesterday afternoon. James
! Little. of San Jose is mixed in a divorce
I action and for some reason Mrs. Little
prefers that the matter be carried to the
Sacramento courts for final settlement.
There is- some objection to this on the
part of the other side and this objection
augmented the bitter feeling already
caused by the bringing of the suit tor
j legal separation.
A motion for a change of venue was on |
Judge Daingerfield's calendar yesterday I
and the hour of hearing found all people I
on hand. Little is the plaintiff in this
action, but his wife, Alice, appears In
that role in a similar action instituted in
San Jose. As Little had proved to the
satisfaction of his wife that he would not
avoid trouble other than legal if the occa
sion presented itself, he having at one
time been arrested for an attempt upon
the life of one Mr. Stewart of San Jose,
whom he charged with harboring his wife,
trouble was in a measure expected when
the case was called yesterday. Attorney
Bowden of San Jose was not deterred,
however, by reason of Little's combative
temperament from expressing an opin- |
ion of his various characteristics and the â 
manner in which he alleged ne had treat
ed his wife. Law was quoted, facts es
tablished and reasons advanced in sup
port of the motion for a change of venue
and with each passing point Little be
came more uneasy. His attorney, Mr.
j King, managed to keep his desire for
â  trouble within bounds for some time,
i nevertheless, but finally, after the case
i was submitted and Judge Daingerfield
I had decided that the little woman who
appealed for a change of place of trial
Ishoud be granted her motion, Little lost
himself. He made but little noise, but I
evidently thought much, until the corri- I
dor was reached. Mr. Bowden with his
client was walking along the corridor,
but just as he was opposite the District
Attorney's office he received a jolt mat
hurled him through the public prosecu
j tor's door and landed him in a reclining
posture on the floor. In an instant all
was excitement. Little had assaulted the
attorney with either a revolver or some
blunt instrument, the crowd about said,
and then a general mixup was imminent
Little avoided further trouble by with
drawing from the scene of action.
Bowden found his feet and rushed in
search of a Police Judge to secure a war
rant for his assailant's arrest He spent
some time in the corridors of the City
Hall without result, but later in the even
ing he located Judge Mogan and a war
rant was km:, In the warrant Bowden
charged Little with an assault with a
deadly weapon and considering the na
ture of the assault the court fixed the
defendant's bail at $3000. Little had not
fallen into the hands of the police up to
a late hour last night, but doubtless his
name will appear on the prison register
before the day is donc._____________________l
M'ADIE GAVE TIMELY
WARNING TO FARMERS
THUNDERSTORM AT FRESNO
AND SNOW IN NEVADA.
State Mining Outlook Is Goodâ Many
Plants Will Start Upâ Good
Water Supply Certain.
Mr. McAdie was greatly elated yester
day at the good work done by the
Weather Bureau in warning the farmers
and grape-growers of the San Joaquin
Valley of the rainstorm.
"Owing to our forecasts," said Mr. Mc
I Adie. "hardly any loss was sustained in
the valley. Every one had ample time to
get his crops or raisins under cover. The
bureau has received several letters of
thanks from various points. ,
"The storm, which began last night and
had spent most of its force by this morn
j Ing, was the heaviest experienced in the
I State for fifty years.
"Up to 5 o'clock to-night 1.63 inches of
rain has fallen in San Francisco.
"The State as a whole has received
groat benefit from the storm, although
there are a few growls to he heard from
the grail) men. They claim that several
thousand acres of unharvested grain have
suffered.
"At 5 o'clock to-night a thunderstorm
is raging In Fresno, and .70 of an inch of
rainfall is reported from there since
morning."
lii Nevada and Utah there has been a
heavy snowfall, but damage to stock will
be very small, as most of it was under
shelter. On the other hand, the snow will
be of the greatest benefit to mining men,
the prospects being much improved at the
promise of plenty of water. Many mines
which have of late shut down owing to
lack of water will resume operations
both below and above ground.
At San Jose the rain has, on the whole,
been of great service, putting out the'
remnants of forest fires and starting the
grass.
Some damage has been done to shipping
at Long Beach. Several small boats were
stove in, and the sloop Elk was ground
to splinters in the surf. The float at the
end of the wharf broke from Its moorings
and destroyed part of the wharf.
To-day with the passing of the storm
there will be a cool spell, the cold proba
bly Increasing until Sunday morning,
when it is very likely there will be slight
frosts. The wind changed last night and
blew briskly from the northwest.
Tlie ship Servia, which arrived last
week from New York, brings 110 cases
of novel pattern linoleums consigned to
the Pattosien Company of San Francisco,

saw the runaways approaching him he
took refuge behind a telegraph pole The
team made straight for the pole and Dun
can, paralyzed with fear, crouched down
The team collided with the pole and one
of the horses was thrown to the ground
and they were soon quieted.
Duncan was picked up in a semi-con
scious^ condition by Policemen Drlscoll

found he had escaped with a lacerated
wound on the forehead, which was

GRAND JURY BEGINS
ITS INVESTIGATION
I PHEIAN REITERATES HIS RE
CENT CHARGES.
Witnesses Called but the Mayor Was
Late and the Meeting Went
Over to Tuesday.
The Grand Jury yesterday afternoon
opened its investigation of the indefinite
charges of Jobbery made by Mayor Pheian
against the Board of Supervisors. Mayor
Phelan's charges were the outcome of the
recently relieved shortage in City and
County Hospital funds, and as his letter
to the jury contained nothing tangible
enough to base a line of action upon he
was one of the first witnesses called yes
terday. He did not make his appearance,
i however, until nearly 5 o'clock, and the
hour being so late the other witnesses
who had gathered were dismissed until
Tuesday next at 2 o'clock.
When Mayor Pheian was called upon to
state his case he reiterated the statement
that the Hospital Committee of the Board
..I Supervisors had bought non-contract
goods in the open market at prices higher
than should have been paid, and that in a
great many cases goods had been bought
in open market which could as well have
been purchased from the regular contrac
tors. The Mayor made no specific charges.
He dealt rather In generalities and held
that the shortage in question had resulted
from extravagance rather than an insuf
ficient appropriation.
Frank McCann, agent for Patek & Co..
the meat contractors, and ex-Supervisor
Clinton were also examined, McCann upon
the connection of his firm with the Super
visors and Clinton regarding the methods
pursued by the last board in providing for
the hospital's needs. The investigation
will be begun in earnest on Tuesday next
at L' o'clock, and it is not expected that a
great deal of time will be burned up in
pushing it through.

PROFESSOR WHEELER DINED.

Honor Berkeley's New
President.
Tho council of the General Alumni As
sociation of the University of California
gave a banquet at the California Hotel
last evening to President Benjamin lde
"Wheeler.
The object of the dinner" was to give
those composing the council an oppor
tunity to become acquainted -with the new

mater.
Nearly every department of the big in
stitution of learning was represented in
the sixteen gentlemen who gathered
around the board and at the call of Pro
fessor W. E. Ritter, president of the
council, who acted as toastmaster for the
occasion, the following guests got upon
their feet and succeeded each other in
bright and witty speeches complimentary
to the distinguished gentleman whom
they had come together to honor: Dr. L.
Van Orden, Dr. W. L. Brewer, J. C.
Whitworth, Dr. A. D. d'Arrcona, "W. R.
Davis and G. E. Bacon.
After listening to all the complimentary
things that these gentlemen had to say
about him Professor Wheeler arose and
in a few appropriate remarks expressed
his pleasure In meeting those represent
ing. the earlier years of the university's
career and his appreciation of the honor
that they had done him.
The dinner was purely an informal af
fair and had no bearing whatever on

"STRIVING FOR THE MOON."
Rabbi Voorsanger Says Success Is
Impossible Without Toil.
In his sermon last night at Temple
Emanu-El Rabbi Voorsanger took for his
subject "Striving for the Moon," in which
he spoke of the continual effort made
by mankind to attain the unattainable.
"Many of us," he said. "are like the
little child who stretches out his hands
to the moon in the belief that the bright
orb will come to it. So are we still dream
ing that we can reach the moon, or, in
other words, jump from the cause to the
effect without labor on our part when we
know quite well that labor alone insures
the effect. It is a mistake for us to think
that we have only to reach out our hands
to pluck the fruit of success, and that the
possession of an Aladdin's lamp will help
us to discover wealth. Man. instead of
following the road, that by his own per
severance, by the application of his own
ability and by his unyielding and unbend
ing will leads to fortune, rather seeks the
other course and believes that by simply
reaching out his hand he will attain the
full extent of his ambition. Man forgets
that the worjd and men in it are ruled
by laws which are unchangeable. Man
is born to toil and he will not succeed
unless he has put his noblest energy tf.
the test. Man without toil becomes an
apathetic creature tuat will degenerate
and be wiped from the face of the earth."

of Odd Fellowship in California. The
executive committee has received from
within the order a large sum of money,
which is being expended in making the
celebration, which will commence next
Tuesday and is to last several days, a
great success, and the indications are that
it will be.
The streets along which there will be a
procession next Thursday are being made
gay with decorations under the direction
of L. G. Schord. the chairman of the
decoration committee, and thousands of
emblematic banners, together with Amer
ican Hags, are being stretched across a
portion of Van Ness avenue, Market,
Montgomery, Bush and Kearny streets.
A force of electricians is at work wiring
the Odd Fellows' Temple at Seventh and
Market streets with electric lights. The
building will he illuminated from the line
of the second story to the top of the
clock tower.
A great many booths to be used by the
four branches of the order are being
erected in the Mechanics' Pavilion, and
some of them will be very- artistic.
In the parade there will be a number of
emblematic floats, which are now being
prepared from designs drawn under the
direction of the parade committee, of
which Frank D. Worth is chairman.
Within the past two weeks the entire
membership in this city has awakened to
a realization of the grandeur of the cele
bration, and all are working: hard to make
a display that, will redound to the credit
of the order.
