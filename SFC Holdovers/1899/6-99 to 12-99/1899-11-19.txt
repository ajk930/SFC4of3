Great concern is felt ere as to what may be the fate of
Winston Churchill, regarding whom no further news has been
received in London since yesterday.
The rumor a.lso comes from Est court that the Boers have
occupied the small village of Mcncn, about twenty-five miles off,
and that they were ncaring Estcourt and looting by the way.
According to the latest dispatches only eight miles separat
ed the main body of the Boers from Estcourt. Their force is
roughly computed at between two and three thousand men, ac
companied by six /-pounders and two French guns.
At Estcourt, however, all is in readiness for an attack. More
stories have come to hand about General Joubert One is that
he is indisposed, which seems to have been the foundation for
the story of his being wounded or killed. Another story is
that he has been ken prisoner, but that is not credited here
as the War Office would have been sure to lean something
about it if there had been any truth in it.

LONDON, Nov. 18. â The latest news from the seat of war
in South Africa is, from one point of view, favorable to the Brit
ish, showing that Kimberley is able to hold her own against the
Boers and that Estcourt is in a position to beat back an. at
tack by the Boer forces now facing it. On the other hand the
advices pay testimony to the ceaseless activity of the burghers on
the Free State frontier and their determination to cut off relief
for Ladysmith, and. if possible, to isolate or capture EstCOUft,
which is the nearest town to Ladysmith still held by the British.
A number of small Boer commandoes from the east and
west are converging on Estcourt and the railroad just
that place. The Boen already aggregate at least jooo. with a
few guns, which they evidently, from* the entrenchments they
are throwing up, mean to mount on hills dominating- atr.

ThÂ« Hamburger Nachrtehten expressed
IT views. In the Vosslche Zeltung
an ex-ofncV-r of the general staff says:
"The history of pa*t wars and the de

forecast for thÂ« cause of the doughty
BoerÃ. In spite of the Immense apparent
superiority against them."
Owing to the British censorship hardly
ar.y cable reports from the seat of war
have yet reached the Germaji papers.

GRIEF OF CHURCHILL'S MOTHER
LONDON, Nov. IS.â lt was while stop
ping at Btsea Park. York, that Lady
Randolph Churchill heard of the heroic
rtreSn of her son Winston In the affair of
the Estcourt armored train and his re
ported capture. Without delay she took
the train and hurried back to town, to as
to be nÂ«%r whenever any fresh news
came.
"He Is the most determined, pushing
fellow in the world," said Lady Churchill.
"We did not like his giving up his com
mission after the Nile campaign. in which
he had made so brilliant a beginning, but
ho thought it was time to be In Parlia
ment. 'You have plenty of time.' we told
him. but he replied: 'Not a bit. My
father was a Cabinet Minister at 26. If
you want success you must begin early.' "
When this war broke out he was very
bitter at having thrown up his commis
sion and was letermlned to get to the
front anyhow. Thin he was able to do by
going as a correrpondent for the Morning
Potit, That paper made him an offer of
Â£11)09 for three months' service. I have

Lord Randolph Churchill, whenever

overworking himself and burning the
candle at both ends, as be habitually did,
Invariably replied: "It does not matter.
I know I shall not live long." And he
continued to crowd on more and more

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 19. 1899.
AMERICAN ARMS ON
THE ROAD TO SUCCESS
Authorities at Washington Expect
That the Filipino Insurrection
Will Soon Be Suppressed.
LIEUTENANT MAXIMILIAN LUNA,
Of Rough Rider Fame, and Late of General Lawton's
Staff, Who Was Drowned in the Rio Agno.
â¢ HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Nov. IS -
With the Insurgent army scattered and
- secretary of the Interior and
private secretary and a large amount of
his munitions of war In the hands of the
American troops, and with good weather
in prospect, it is evident to the authori
ties that the American arms are well on
the road to the suppression of the Filipino
tlon.
General Otis reported In a dispatch re
j ceived to-day that it would appear that
j the main Insurgent force had been driven
northwestward off the road to Bayom
bong. and It Is understood here that Gen
eral Wheaton will try to drive It back
before It can be crushed by General Law
> ton's troops. The rapidity with which
! General Lawton has been moving Is a
I matter of considerable satisfaction to the
authorities. His cavalry has occupied
, Agulnaldo's old capital of Bayombong. on
: the railroad line connecting Manila and
i Dagupan. and General Mac Arthur's ad
i vance force has reached Panlque, twelve
miles south of Bayombong.
It has been the policy of General Law
ton's and of General Mac Arthur's outly
ing forces to traverse every Important
{ road within the cordon of American/
troops already established, to drive any
Insurgent bands that may be found to the
northward upon the American troops
awaiting them.
Ii is evident that It will not be long be
fore the entire railroad is in possession of
the American troops. When this is ac
complished It will be the work of some of
the troops to destroy the insurgent bands
' which General Otis reports having sought
refuge In the province of Zambaels; west
of the railroad.
It Is apparent to the authorities that
General Lawton Is making a determined
, effort to destroy the rebels reported as
â¢ occupying Pozorrublo.
General Young and Major Ballance aro
at Azingan and Roaslos, respectively, and
; the latter is expected to move on urda
1 neta, where the Insurgent troops ure re
ported. It Is expected that General Whca
tlon will also bring some of his troops
into action against Posorrublo and the
authorities are hopeful that the movement
will retail In complete success. General
Lawton will doubtless try to keep the In
surgent troops along the Western coast,
, although It is admitted there are no nat
ural obstacles in the way of a retreat to
tnbong, proclaimed as Aguinaldo's
new capital.
OTIS REPORTS THE

dream that the British had a long-range
gun here, as they were coming on with
the utmost confidence, expecting to be In

crossing the railway. The bluejackets
abruptly arrested their progress, and de
serve credit for the accuracy with which

T. Carey Friedlander. whose position as
tcretary of the San Francisco Produce

vith the shipping men and the shipping
iroblems of this port, has decided views

nore extensive facilities for the com
nerce of San Francisco by sea.
"I am firmly convinced." said Mr.
Friedlander. "that the seawall ought to
extended southerly as soon as possi
ble. â¢'-â â¢â  of progress we have
nade in seawall building it will take us
nany years to get through with the work

serce needs more facilities now. The

May cheek a Cold t*o quick
A carpenter of Morristown. a great,
Etrong, hearty fellow, says: " '77'
breaks up my Cold in two doses. I
don't follow the directions on the bot-
tle; when I take Cold I at once take
half the contents of a 23c bottle, then
I wait a while and take the balance.
My Cold is gone the same day." While
this may be all very well for a strong
man. It is not always best to check a.
Cold too quickly and possibly drive it
to some weak spot; it la better to fol-
low the directions of six pellets ever>
hour. It then restores the checked cir-
culation (known by a chill or shiver),

veins and makes a steady cure of a Cold

CORRIGAN IS BARRED
FROM OAKLAND TRACK
His Stake Entries Refused by
the California Jockey Club.
Sensation in Racing Circlesâ Entrance
Money of the Gambler Returned by
Registered Mail.
y==SDWARD CORRIGAN. horseman
|!=3 and gambler, has come to the
conclusion that the Golden State
l> â  j may Iâ¢â¢ all It ought to be. but that
the people in it are all they ought
not to b*. Corrlgan thinks he has another
grievance and he has be<-n airing It so
thoro . â  k his a.-,.- : -.i fol
lowers' at T.i : Tan that naturally It has
become public property. This time CoT
rigan has been struck in a viml spotâ his
â¢â â¢ t .fornia
Jockey C;ub has politely bjt very Ormly
fused r stake races
at the Uak.ar.i track. This Is perhaps
the n. - Mow that Corrlc&i
i n-it.g career, it la a re
ii ... : . â¢ as et
irherever racing is patronised as a
:aate sport in the United States.
The relusal of the California Jockey
Club to accept the Corrigan entries means
not only this but it involves a material
financial loss to the man whose presence
and participation in legitimate racing Is
thus shunned. Corrigan kept his repudia
tion to himself for a while, but the Oak
land racing will be resumed to-morrow
and he 1.0 longer could keep secret the
causes of his inability to take part In
them. He therefore told the story to hta
friends.
On November I entries for the Oakland
Etake races closed, and Corrigan. hoping
for something of the success which h<i
had won last season, entered liberally
He was astounded to see the return of his
entrance monÂ«Â»y and the announcement
that his entries were not wanted. The of
ilcers of the California Jockey Club it Is
said, were very careful to malt* sure that
the money was safely returned, so they
sent It in a duly registered letter for
which Corrigan gave his receipt.
This action by the California Jockey
Club completely bars the gambler from
mÂ»>rr* cf Mia Paciflc, which is a predomi
nant
-Probably from {1.000,000 to 000.000
could be speedily expended uoon the
water front, and that cannot be too soon
if the money Is Judiciously used. Liver- |
pool has expended Jl2o.Oju.OjO for harbor |
work, docks, on the bar and so on. A. I
great steamer can now go in there at ;
any tide. The New York linors used to
Le compelled to lie outside. Now there la
a floating tlo< k. half a mile long, beside
which they can come at any tide. Then
there are the famous closed docks. We
have not the difficulties with which Liver
pool had to contend. Our rise and fall of
the tide is only blx or seven feet. Liver
pool has provided itself with the leading
harbor of the world. In all the handling
of the great sums of money expended In
the Liverpool harbor, the expenditures
extending throuph a period of years, there
has never been a. suggestion of fraud. To
handle the State's water front In San
Francisco we have had hayseeds and poli
ticians. We do not need to have any
scandals attending the administration of
our water front If we have men of expe
rience and knowledge and character to
look out for our Interests. The Harbor
Commissioners ought to be elected on
their merits, without consideration of
party affiliation.
"What I have said Is the general talk
of merchants and shipping men. We can
not wait long. Steamers of 10.000 tons are
building, ana It is Intimated that the Pa
cific Coast terminus of the line upon
which they will nin will be at Seattle. If
we wish to have 10,OX>-ton steamers como
here we have to move. Nothing Is of
such vital consideration for this State as
the providing of ample facilities to ac
commodate all the shlppine. If a wheat
tleet commensurate with the crop raisM
had come here this season the facilities
for unloading would not have been found
at all adequate. The shortage In tonnage
all over the world alone prevented a pain
ful realization of this fart by all. With
adequate tonnage we ought to have
shipped to date 3*0,000 more tons of grÃln
than have passed out. We cannot build
the seawall within four years, but that
is no reason why we should not make a
move. We will have to wait for the next
Legislature, and then for an election.
Commerce will be Impatient; it will not
wait.
â¢â¢We fhould have Mr docks in Mission
Bay. There was lost the 'â¢â¢ it chance in
the* world for a land-locked bay when the
land west of Kentucky street was sold.
There we could have had ship and rail to
gether in a second. I think that many of
our Improvements on the water front are
not substantial enough. The seawaY is
rubble-f freed. It Is â  question whether. In
the long'' run, It would not have been morÂ«
economical to have had it faced with solid
blocks of granite/*

Oakland. As he cannot enter his horses
in Stake races it Is unlikely that he will
enter them In other events. He had relied
upon the stakes to pull him out of a very
bad financial hole, as he believe* that ha
owns several fair performers. He and his
methods will be connned, therefore, to
Tanforan. There are several reasons for
the action token by the California Jockey
Club. In the lirst place. Corrlgan Is a
constitutional disturber and creates dis
cord wherever be has Influence. in the
second place, his methods are not such
as to recommend him to honest sports
men. He wants something more than the
even chances of the game, and horsemen
intend that he shall i.Â«i â¢ <-â¢ only what he
deserves.
This is not the first rebuke that Corrl
gan has received this year. The stewards
of the jockey clubs met in September and
barred him from such* Eastern tracks as
Morris Park. The Btewards did not want
him on these tracks and refused him a
trainer's license, without which he can
not race his horses. He Is barred, there
fore. In the East and in the Wtst and is
confined now in his operations to Tan
foron, which, notwithstanding reports, he
controls. In the Turf Congress he swore
that he had no interest In Tanforan. The
fact remains, however, that races are ar
ranged to suit his conditions, his satellites
are in the stand and advantages for victo
ries are unfairly placed in his hands.
These facts are matters of common gos
sip. Th. have passed the stage of specu
lation, and all horsemen take It as a mat
ter of fact that Corrigan does as he
pleases in absolute control at Tanforan.
Horses seem to run under his hypnotic
Influence, rae-s are conditioned to suit
him and results are to his liking. He has
all the fruits of mastery if not thÂ» name.
Since he has been excluded from Oakland
his followers at Tanforan are murmuring
threats of retaliation. It Is not llkÂ»ly,
however, that th murmurs will grow
loud enough to be heard In Oakland.
Thore is even In a Cnrrigan satellite an
instinct of common sense.

terday afternoon at the Chapman ranch i
four miies southeast of this city. Moy' '

head he had turned to defend himself
On the forehead and face were other cuts
where the cruel murderer had finished up i
his helpless victim. There is no clew to

conservative action in regard to all of our
new possessions. As to the Philippine*.
much will depend upon the recommenda
tion cf the President, pased upon the full
of the Philip; ilsston. ThÂ«
duration of th*. Insurgents
will also be Important In I r de
laying action.
President McKlnley will recommend
that the Inhabitants of the islands be
given â¢he utmost liberty of local or tribal
self-government of which they are capa-
Me under the sovereignty and general con
trol of the United States, but neither the
Philippine Commission nor the President
has yet worked out the details of such a
government. Congress will support the
President in his determination to suppress
the Insurrection and maintain American
sovereignty on the Islands. Porto Rico
without doubt will be given a civil govern
ment, modeled as nearly as the conditions
on the Island will permit upon the gov
ernment of territories within the United
States.

Terror Inspired in France by the Pre

Astronomer.

PARIS. Nov. 11. â Many people are
amazed to find themselves still alive. The
prediction of a "yellow" astronomer that
the world's end was fixed for November
13 appears to have been taken most se
riously. Some churches In Paria were
crowded on Monday until 3 in the after
noon, the hour the catastrophe was due.
The comet failed to -â¢â¢;.. when the
clock did. so the territled sinners stopped
praying and went off to enjoy life again,
one woman living in the country came
to Paris to be among her relatives. An
other was so panic stricken at the Idea
of the end of the world that she died
from sheer fright. Still another invited a
number of friends to celebrate their last
moments on earth in her house In Passy.
The roadbed of the Paris Belt Railway
Is being widened In this part of the city
arid the work necessitates blasting ope
rations. Just as the lady and her guests
1 were getting over their nervousness a for
midable detonation shook the house.
"The comet:" shrieked a lady, and fell
in a dead faint.
It is to be hoped the authorities will
< not permit blasting the next time the
| worla comes to an end. In Paris solici
j tors were snowed under with the work
i of making wills for clients anxious to
j leave th, affairs In order. One poor ser
vant girl, with tears in her eyes, im
plored her mistress to see she was given
decent burial.
An immense number of candles were
burned in churches by the faithful. Even
the ascent of astronomers In balloons
avowedly to observe the flight of shoot
ing stars may really have been merely a
selfish pretext to get away from the earth
before the comet demolished it.
NEEDLEWORK EXHIBITION.
SAN JOSE. Nov. 17.â The local branch
of the Needlework Guild of North Amer
ica held its annual exhibition of the prod- ,
ucts of its labors yesterday afternoon. At
the guild's room In the Tiny building were
all kinds of clothing and bedclothes.
These have been made by the members
and their triends during the past year.
Nearly 1000 articles, all new. are dis
played.
These have been apportioned among the
various charitable organizations as fol
lows: Associated Charities. 100; Benevo
lent Society. 100; Pratt Home. 50; O'Con
nor Sanitarium. Vk<: Notre Dame
Orphanage. 100; Sacred Heart Society, iÂ£j;
Volunteers of America, 73; Salvation ,
Army. 123; Catholic Ladies' Aid Society,

At a meeting of the Guild's di
rectors the following officers were
elected for the following year: Presi
dent, llrs. C. J. Martin; first vice presi
dent. Mrs. Hannah Bean; second vice
president, Mrs. P. M. Lusson: third vice

uation. Leading advocates of the canal
are determined to bring the matter for
ward again, however, and to try to get
some sort of a measure through, even
without waiting for the report of the
commission.
One of the most Important measures
brought forward will be the bill for the
promotion of merchant shipping by means
of subsidies paid to vessels of American
register engaged In trade with foreign
ports. The so-called Hanna-I'ay: bill
will be reintroduced in both bouses and
will be pushed to a vote as rapidly as pos
sible. Its advocates are confident of its
early passage.
Propositions to establish a new execu
tive department to be known as the De
partment of Commerce, or colonial de
partment. Its head to have a seat in the
Cabinet, will be advanced, but present in
dications are that action wiLl be delayed
until the relations of the new possessions
to the General Government are more
clearly defined.
Interesting questions Involving seats In
both houses will come forward early In
the session. Mr. Quay will present him
self for admission to the Senate by virtue
of his appointment by Pennsylvania's
Governor, and the constitutional q\
of the right of a Governor to

"There seems to be some uncertainty

RELYING ON ThjE MOON.
fl TIME there was when the settlement which
/ \ has since grown to be San Francisco was
Francisco
* * known as Yerba Buena. It was in those days
a community where people went to sleep at lark and
rose at dawn. When they desired a licsta by night
they consulted a calendar and chose a full moon nigh;
for the date of the festival. Thus the youths and
maidens who grew up in Yerba Bucna learned to love
the moon and cherished her light among their bright
â 
The community has long since outgrown nearly
even- custom and habit of those early days. San

to- Yerba Bucna, nor does the bustling activity of her
life,' flowing along unceasingly by night as well a s by

day. have anything in common with the quiet life
ot the old time. In one respect, however, there has
been no change. For a certain space in each month
our municipal authorities shut off the lights of civili
zation, extinguish alike the gleam of gas and the
glow of electricity, to leave the city and its people to
the illumination of the lights of other days, and for
that period all our people have to go about at night
by the- light of the moon, even as was done when the
town was Yerba Buena.
Not long ago a diÂ«rtinguished traveler from Ger
xna4y, a nobleman of wealth and social habits, came
to San Francisco to behold the beauties thereof an 1
to study its culture. He struck the town during one
of its Yerba Buena periods. He went out one night
to make a sociil call and found himwlt in darkness,
for clouds and fops had come to hide the lovely light
of the moon. Xot to be balked of his visit by that
mishap he bought himself I lantern, and for a week
or more he saw San Francisco by lantern-light every
night and furnished the lantern at his own expense.
I a time is this condition of things to
â¢ rwnv become a. great city â
ted in the world. Its multifold ac
and pleasure can be no longer
ght alone. Thousands of people
fc'' '" <â¢ a nrrd f >r well lighted

' ncped to find a well lighted city. It iÂ«

Something should be done by the municipal author
ities to put an end to the absurdity of the situation.
The Yerba Buena custom of relying upon moonlight
is one of the kind that are more honored in the breach
than in observance. There is' not only an inconve
nience but a danger in these regularly recurring pe
riod* of darkness. In tome parts of the city private
enterpri&e has lighted certain of the principal thor
oughfarev and the enterprise is commendable, but
it is a- weak and inefficient municipal administration
whiclr renders such enterprise necessary. Even so
prest a thoroughfare as Market street is left to misty
darkness during the moonlight period, and when the
right is clouded would be in total darkness were it
not for the lights which are radiated from stores and
from restaurants.
We rre to have a new charter in force very soon.
Let us have a new lighting system with it. We are
to ftart a new era. let us signalize it by doing away
with the Yerba Buena reliance on the moon. It will
rot be difficult to find a way to light the streets every
night if the city officials honestly try to accomplish
it. and a resolute public opinion should demand that
they make the trial at once.
In the prim business /of war all the destructive
power of modern weapons, all the merciless ingenuity
of fighters, have led before disease as agents of
death. In thirteen months of war the records show
that only 496 American soldiers were killed in battle.
while 6223 died from disease and other causes than
an enemy's work on the 'Held.
DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISTS.
\A R. WATTERSON concludes that the Novem

with exceeding >:.ec. Along with this outburst of
Democratic imperialism come? the announcement that

straw that might count something in lloat

inenmbrance. He is a mortgage which his party is

'â  country toward him is expressed by Senator

imperialism in preference to Mr. Bryan and the Chi

UNIVERSITY ENDOWMENTS.
ACCORDING to estimate* based upon the sum
received by Mrs. Stanford from the sale of her
Southern Pacific stock Stanford University is
assured of an endowment valued at something like
$30,000,000. If the e-timate be not exaggerated that
will give to Stanford the rank of being the wealthiest
of American educational institutions, and far in ad
vance of any other.
A recent compilation of the endowments of univer
sities in this country, made after what appears to have
been a careful investigation by a writer for the New
York Sun. credits Girard College with a productive
I endowment of $15,250,000; Stanford, $13,500,000: Har
vard, $10,000,000; Columbia, $q.5oo,ooo; Cornell,
$8,000,000; Chicago. $6,500,000; and Yale, $4,500,000.
Each of these is credited with holdings in excess of
, the fipures given, and some of the holdings will evrn
, tuallv become a part of the revenue yielding wealth,
; so that in every instance the "productive funds" may
be nracfa hirgcr in a lew years than they are now. At
The tune the compilation was made it was estimated
! the seven universities named have in the aggregate an
; income of $7.47^50, or an average of more than
$1,000,000 each.
That is an excellent showing for our universities,
and yet it is but a drop in the bucket of the total
amount of wealth which the American people have
devoted DO higher education. In the article quoted
it is Ktated t>cre are 420 colleges and universities in the
I'nitcl State! ftnd they have an invested capital in ex
cess of $^50,000,000. They employ something like
25.000 professor! and teachers and have now on their
rd of 175.000 students. It is a showing of
which we as a people can be justly proud. What other
nation can show anything approaching it?
It i* noted that in every university in the United
States the cost of giving instruction to a student is
considerably in excess of the price fixed for tuition.
â¢ jucntly a university loVs money by each sta
ll that in some of the larger universities
the problem of providing education for the number of
students who apply for it has become a serious one
and UUSteei have had to raise the standard of ad
mission not only for the purpose of advancing the
degree of instruction given but for that of limiting the
student body to the number the university can afford
to receive.
To meet the demand for education the liberality of
the people in voting increased revenues for State uni
THE FAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, NOTEMBEH 19. 1899.
versities and the generosity of wealthy citizens have
done much. It is estimated that during the past ye3r
our colleges and universities have received from pri
vate citizens donations exceeding $20,000,000. Every
year sees large sums added to the endowments of the
greater institutions, and in future these are sure to in
crease with the increasing wealth of the people.
At the present time it is estimated that American
universities represent an investment of $14-5 for each
student, while in Great Britain the average is about
$750 and in Germany something like Sfoo. For the
management of the large property interests there is
required at the head of our greater universities an
executive having bu*ine*s ability of the first order.
As lie is also expected to be a scholar or a man of
science as well as a business man. the selection of a
president for one of these institutions is a matter of
no little difficulty. California is fortunate in having
at the head of her two great universities men of the
rank of Whrrler and Jordan. She is thus assured
that the large sums provided for education at Berkeley
and Palo Alto will be so administered as to procure
from them the best service to the cause to which they
are devoted.
IT is to be hoped that the effort to systematize an
irrigation policy in this State will not disappear
in the great rainfall and the compromises oi the
recent convention.
'1 he antagonism of party platforms and the cry of
"irrigation without debt," by which the Federal irn
gators have roused that old and ever present desire
to get something lor nothing, have combined to turn
the thoughts of the people toward Washington for
aid. It has always been true that neglect follows the
expectation ot help from the outside. California has
buch a peculiar interest in the subject that we can
not long afford to wait for external help. An appro
priation of a million or two in the river and harbor
bill, according to the plan of the Federalists, when
divided between the many States and Territories
which are out with their buckets after water, will leave
just enough, for each, to be wasted. Suppose the
amount is ten millions, ior which the most arid Fed
eralist can hardly hope, vet in the division only a pit
tance would fall to California. It is perfectly true that
'.lie larger the demand the greater will be the opposi
tion to it. The river and harbor bill is now so large
that Presidents sign it with aversion, and sometime:.
vÂ«to v, as did Arthur and Cleveland
\\ ith this new demand upon it the economical senti
ment of the country will I><- ai uneasiness and
watchfulness. The officers in charge of the fiscal
affairs of the Government are not feeling any too easy
just now.
( >i;r attentive readers will remember that some
months ago The Call said that the usual speculative
features have appeared in the business of the country
and there was gathering that atmosphere in which
financial panics are generated. It is not pleasant to
know that the Storm was ready to break within the
last ten days, and was only averted by the offer of the
treasury to redeem twenty-five millions in unmatured
Ixnds. RussHi Sage is quoted as saying that this
â jf Secretary Gage saved the financial world from
a disastrous panic. With these clouds upon the Fed
eral financial situation economies are likely to be in
order more than new enterprises, over which, at the
best. Federal jurisdiction is in doubt.
< "!t of it all is to be drawn the lesson that the State
must not abandon this great interest to outside expec
tations. The permanent organization, which was the
most important result of the convention, should keep
an eye on the situation, and when it is apparent that

LONDON reports concerning the course of the
war in the Transvaal are vague, but they are
sure and confident on one point. It is said by
all authorities that as a result of the conflict the social
season this winter is to be one of the gloomiest Lon
don has e\er known. With the British troops in
Africa are many of the gay young ofticcrs wlio-e
presence delighted the belles of the ballrooms, and in
their absence there is to be but little of that round of
pleasure which usually makes up the tenor of fashion
able life in that richest and most hospitable of the
capitals of the earth.
It is a familiar saying that when it rains in London
New York clubmen turn up their troupers and carry
umbrellas no matter how brightly the sun shines on
Fifth avenue and the drives of Central Park. Per
haps the moral as well as the physical weather of Lon
don may have its effect on our own metropolis, and
j belles and beaux of the United States may deem it
I proper to wear countenance! of grave decorum and
be gloomy this winter in harmony with the British.
It would not be altogether a matter of jesting
should it be so New York is socially in close al
liance with London. The Astors, the Vanderbilts.
the Whitneys. the Jeromes and many another family
ot light and leading in American society have close
ties not only of friendship but of marriage and of
blood with the families who in a large measure direct
the social life of Great Britain. It is certain that in
Xrw York the bulletins of the wounded and the killed
in battle with the Boers are read in many a stately
mansion with almost as much anxiety as in those of
London itself. It would not be strange, then, if the
ploom overhanging British society should cast a
shadow upon the gayeties of our own metropolis.
A gloomy social season this winter would be, hefw
ever, something like an affront to nature. All the
natural conditions of the time in our country incline
men and women to gladness and to rejoicirtg. Never
have our industries been more prosperous and rarely
have brighter prospects illumined the future. The ill
effects of the hard times ol the past have been almost
wholly eradicated by the abundant crops of the last
two years, and at present all clashes of workers are
receiving the rewards due to enenry. industry and
thrift. Those persons who by their fortunes and their
inclinations are in the lead of social life have therefore
abundant reason for making this a gay season and 1
happy one. We may be sorry for the Briton and the
Boer, but in that sorrow there is nothing to prevent
us from dancing. We have the money to pay the
piper, and why should we not set his pipes a-playing?
It has been suggested that the Stockton merchant
who attempted to set fire to an entire block enter
a plea of insanity. The suggestion has been made
probably from the fact that the culprit was so easily
caught at his criminal work.
France has again escaped from civil war. The
Senate has convened, and within its historic walls
Parisian revolutionary wrath is exploding into harm

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
JOHN McNAUGHT
Among Â«he minor lessors to bo draw:
from current events and which may
; rtjr be included among variations of
the centra] theme is one which tend* to
slow the foolishness of the doctrine that
the way to have peace Is to prepare for
war. Old Dr. Johnson told the world
long at;o that proverbial wisdom is as
t as copper coin and Just about as
valuable, w.- ar.Â» having a oew proof of
the truth of his saylnp. We are very for
midable to the Filipinos, but th>-y nre
attacking us with the fury of bantam
cocks; ;ir.il <'ir>.<t I'ritain is a portentous
adversary for the Boers, but none ihe
less the Bo<-rs are making war as vigor
orously as if the British were wholly un
.-â¢ .1 10 guard against It.
It will be remembered that In our con
troversies with Great Britain there Is
never any danger of war, but on the con
trary a confidence on both sides that
the peace between the two will not be
broken. Some may think the confidence
due to frat* rnal sentiments, the common
language of Bbakeapears and Milton, and
Anglo-Saxon unity: but the world at
lan:.- know* the continuance of peace Is
due mainly to th* fact that 1. :ther side
is prepared for war against the other.
Had the British been as unpr<*par<*<l for
wnr with Ooso Paul as they are for war
with I'rv'le Sam they would hsve no
flfjlit with the Boers: and had we been as
unprepared for war with Spain us we are.
for war with Great Britain we would
not have interfered In Cuba any more
than we nre going to Interfere In the
TransvaaL
Those who study human affairs as r*-
I In the coTirse of the llv*s of In

pare for trouble always flnd trouble, and
Who are not prepared for It kip â¢ p

with uls'ol or club to protect himself

goes on his way, minding his own luisi

on him.
It appear! to be with nations very
much as with Individuals. Where there is
a readiness for war there is very sure to
be war. The way for a nation to have
peace is to put itself In a condition w m re
It will have reason to seek peace with
diligence and keep It when found. The
proverbial saying thai the way to pre
serve peace Is to prepare for war should
be referred to the debating societies for
reconsideration.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Lest any one conclude from the fore
going that the wars now being waged on
behalf of the white man's burden are
wrong or Improper or anything like
breaches of etiquette, It may be worth
while to say there Is one bit of wisdom,
made by Pope as current as a proverb,
which Is quite true and can be relied
upon. "Whatever is. Is right." The wars
are, and therefore they are right.
In this connection It Is worth noting
that the Archbishop of Armagh has been
moved by the eplrlt of the time to con
tribute something to the war verse of
Great Britain and recently pent to the
London Times what is perhaps the best
poem that has been written since the
fighting began. It Is too long to be quoted
entire, but the opening stanzas run thus:
They *ay that "war Is hell," thÂ« "great ao
curÂ«ed."
The Mn Impossible to be forirlvenâ
Yet I ran look beyond It at Its worst.
And still find blue In heaven.
And an T note how nobly natures form
Under the war's red rain. I deem It true
That He who made the earthquake and the
Ktorm
Perchance makes battles too!
The Uf> He loves Is not the life of span
Abbreviated by each pas*lnÂ«; bi^ath.
It Is the true humanity of Man,
Victorious over death.
The lons expectance of the upward rasa,
Sprite Ineradicable of things afar.
Fair hope of flndln* after many days
The bright and morning Star.
Methlnk* I see how spirits mar be tried.
Transfigured Into beauty on war's verge.
Like flowers, whose tremulous grace Is learnt
beside
The trampling of the surge.
â¢ â¢ â¢
While in Great Britain there ore poets
enough from Archbishops to Klpllngs to
sing something of glory Into the war with
the Boers, there Is a dull, apathetic 11st
lessness among the poets of America not
only upon war subjects but upon all sub
jects. We. are bragging much in these,
days over the exuberant vitality of Amer
ican life, which is supposed to. manifest
Its. lf in things Intellectual and moral as
well as in things material, and yet we
have brought forth no poem of note for
many a day save the "Man With the
Hoe."
It cannot be said we are indifferent to
poetry, for the fervor displayed In dls
cupping Markhnm's poem shows that we
are yearning for Just that kJnd of topic
of conversation as a change from politics
and the ladies. Recent events have fur
nished Inspiring theme* for poets

fields of peotry of any blossom appropri

to find a verse to adorn a classic review

dig up from an unknown writer this
verse:
"Ah. LORD GOD, if yon believed m*.

Over cities, kingdoms, empires.
Castles, towns, and towers.
For the men that powerful be

"When Rome was mistress of the world
some Roman Senator may have spoken
with a serene, unassuming arrogance
equal to that of Lord Salisbury in speak
ing at the Lord Mayor's banquet last
week, but certainly no such speech has
ever been reported. Salisbury Is a very
gifted orator, a past mast, of the art of
public speaking, and of that other art of
adding to the force of speech by the man
ner of delivery, but he never before ac
complished any such success as that of
the Guildhall address.
Th/ circumstances of the speech must
be taken Into consideration. Great Brit
ain Is at war with a stubborn breed of
lighters in a quarter of the globe, so re
mote her troops and supplies have to be
transported 6000 miles to reach the scene
of action; her garrisons on the frontier
are beleaguered and In Imminent danger
of being overwhelmed before relief can
reach them; a hostile Europe, eager to
protlt by any disaster to the British arms,
waits full armed and ready to take advan
tage of the first opportunity that comes;
and there are signs and portents of storm
all around the horizon, from Egypt to
China.
Under suoh circumstances one would ex
pect from the Prime Minister, the orator
speaking for the Government, a full
voiced appeal to thÂ© patriotism of the peo
ple, to the god of battles, to all things
high and mightyâ an oration full of flre
and fervor, rolling in sonorous sentences
suggestive of trumpets and war drums.
Very different was the speech of the noble
Lord. Ho was as quiet as one of those
stage heroes, who does not even take off
his gloves when he goes to meet the vil
lain. The blase British repression of feel
ing was never better exemplified. Salis
bury dealt with all the issues of the time
In Homething like the customary persi
flage of after-dinner oratory. The whole
tone of the speech was one- of easy as
sumption of British superiority over
everything In sight, and implied in every
word that thero Is nothing about which
the Government is In the least disturbed
or even animated.

A popular actor In New York bavin*
been called to the footlights by tumult
uous applause at the close of a successful
run of a new melodrama, responded cour
teously in a speech, and In the course of
It told his audienco that long experience
on the stage has taught him that the
world likes scoundrels.
| The average playgoer thinks the pleas
ure he derives from a drama is due to the
satisfaction of seeing a villain punished,
but the thought, it appears, is a species
of self-deception. The new actor, who Is
also a playwright, said that at one time
he excluded villains from his plays and
gave the public nothing but heroes and
rewarding heroines. The public refused
to be pleased with such productions
"Now," said he. "I provide shoals of
scoundrels, and the public likes them and
pays liberally to see them."
This doctrine is not so unreasonable as
appears at first thought. It has long ago
been pointed out that our delight In hu
mor is due to a consciousness of our
superiority to whoever furnishes they
humor. We like a clown because h<?
flatters our pride In our own dignity
Why may we not like a villain because
he flatters our pride in our morality?
There Is. moreover, a sneaking desire
on the part of the best people to throw
aside dignity ami play the fool a while,
so probably there Is a similar desire to es
cape at times from our virtue and be a.
villainâ and smile.
In his little speech the New York actoi
has thrown a light upon some political
problems. May not the success of many
a politician be due to the fact that as a
voting as well as a theater-going people,
we like scoundrels?

WORKING FORA
LARGER NAVY
Yon Heeringen Aids the
Kaiser.
â 
BERLIN. Nov. IS.â The movement to j
increase the navy has not lost Its vigor, j
The agitation started by the Emperor Is .
being skillfully managed. Captain yon |
llet.-rtr.ffen of the Berlin Ministry, who
has done most of the literary work con
nected with the matter, has by the Km
furor's orders published a pamphlet ar
gulr.g powerfully for the necessity for a
large navy. By a liberal use of parallel i
columns he shows that the navy should
at least i>e doubled In order to accomplish !
its proper work. The Emperors affection
for this raval officer was shown wnen.
speaking c! a naval attache of a foreign I
power, he said. "Hetringen i.* my Cap
tain Maban."
Captain Heeringen has ffone to Munich
to explain to the Prince Regent of Ba
varia the features of the naval plan and
its necessity. He also goes on the same
mission to Stuttgart. Carlsruhe ar.d Dres
den. In :he meanwhile the sentiment of
the ration la favor cf the plan .s stead- '
ily grcwing ar.d the bulk of the press Is
apparently being convinced. A number
of popular movements in support of the
plan ere being arranged. Including one
for lectures Is all the important cltieÂ«
under the auspices of a sccre of th<Â» most
prominent persons.
Among the lecturers who have offered
their services are Admiral Werner and
Prcfessors Wagner and Schmoller. Tha
papers are filled with communications
from all scrts ar.d conditions of people- i
advocating the Increase. In cne of these !
In the Kreuse Zeitung Count yon Rlech- !
e:;bach says: "The Kaiser is the besrt ;
naval expert. It is only necessity to vote
As a matter of fact, the movement may
be said to have won even before the
Reichstag has anything to do with it. I
This is hhown by the fact that all the
cavy-yards are working to the utmost
ar.d that new shipyards arÂ© betas start
ed in liajiet-mden. The Vulcan works
have established a branch at Gesste
xaur.d. It is said in naval circles that ihÂ»
consent of the Reichstag has not bten '
waited for. as it is assumed the Empe
rors plan will pass. The Vorwaerts de
cisively says:
Â£r3S2; Kru ?PÂ». w alle professing great
patriotism, have r.ct scruples to make
enormous contracts for the construction,
cf new navy yards in Russia, being as
sured of on annual profit of 27 000 000 ru
b.es by the Russian Government. The
fame :lrm also sold the United States,
through the carntgies. the latest and
best steel plates, which have been found
better than the Harveylzed. This " the

By the Emperor's wish the famoi-i
Koorrr.agyer and other Hungarian danctS.
hitherto unknown to Germa::v. will be i
taught to the court ladies by a Hungarian
nobleman named Pottak. The dar.ces will
be tried during the coming court carnival
According to the advice cf the tubercu
losis congress a number of asylums for '
the free treatment of poor consumptives !
are b*iii? established In Germany. The
..rat was dedicated at Baden this week
by thÂ« orar.d Duke.
The f.rst female doctor admitted" to gen
eral practice in Germany by the authori
ties is a Berlin girl. Agnes Hacker. It has
taken the Prussian Cabinet two years to
decide her case.
The Agrarian newspapers comment on
the fact that during the past nine months
thai importation of American horses has J
Increa?e>i by _(.<?S head.
The offlcers of the National Butchers'!
Guild will on Friday next consider thÂ« ad
risibility of calling a congress of Euro
pean butchers to devise steps against the
increase of competition of American '
meats. The guild has distributed during
the last two months millions of poster*
and pamphlets on this subject. The main
right will be made In the Reichsta? on the
meat inspection b!!l. The Agrarian pa
pers are resurrirrc their campaign a rains t
American meat. The news that the United
States Government !s sending instruments
and other proof of thoroughness of Amer
ican inspection !s thus sarcastically com
mented on by the Tages Zeitung:
"Surely they won't send the famous
double-bottom Chicago boilers In which
confiscated cattle disappear in ordÂ»Â»r t<"> re
appear In the form of canned meat. Per
haps it would be well to send at the same
tirr.* a number cf American inspectors
who must devour all the trlchlnous sau
rages discovered by German Inspection.
There would, at least, be some sense in
that."
In this connection It may be noted that
a number of cases of illness in German
garrisons are reported this week. In
Schonberg there were forty-two cases
among the non-commissioned officers and
a large number of privates were 111, due
to spoiled geese cr.d unwholesome pota
toes. Not a sir.srle Instance of disease was
traced to American meat.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
BRAIN FOOD
Is cf Little Benefit Unless It Is
Digested.
Nearly every ore will admit that as a
nation we eat too much meat ani too lit-
tle of vegetables and th<? grains.
For business men. office men and clerks,
and. la fact, every one engaged In sed-
er.tary or indoor occupations, grains.
milk and vegetables are much more
1.-althful.
Only men engaged la a B^vcre outdoor
mcr.ual labor can live on a heavy meat
diet and continue In health.
At a general rule, meat once a day la

and children, ar.d grair.s. fruit and vege-
tables ihould constitute the bulk of food

Hut many of the most nutritious foods
are difficult of digestion, and it is of no
use to advise brain workers to eat largely
of trains and vegetables where the diges-

erly.
It Is always best to get the best results
from our ford that some simple and

proven iituart's Dyspepsia Tablets to be a
very safe, pleasant and effective digestive

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can harJly
be called a patent medicine, as they .1o

ROBERTS IN HIS
OWN DEFENSE
Says His Church Has
Not Broken Faith.
Special D!Â«patch to Ths Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. IS.-The Times to
morrow will publish a three-column arti
c.e by Congressman Brlgham H. Roberts,
discussing the efforts being made to ex
clude him from the House. Mr. Roberts
says in part:
"Those engaged in working up a public
sentiment against the representative from
Ltah demand of the House of Representa
tives cither that he be not allowed to
take his seat, to which it has been a.Jrnit
tod lie was legally elected, or. after beir.jj
admitted, that he be exprll.nl. That the
v^ extremely doubtful.
A* many well meaning and Christian
ministers outside of Utah are misled by
the falsehood of those at the bottom of
J"* . /eliglo-political scheme to unseat
l tuh s representative, and thus defeat the
txprosfcC'l will of the people of a sover
eign state, I point out some of the false
cnargea on which the agitation is based.
It Is falsely chargt-a that the Mormon
church has broken faith with the Govern
ment of the United States in reference to
polygamy; that is. it is charged that the
practice of polygamous marriages has
been resumed by the church.
"In the first place, it must be remem
bered that no compact exists between the
Mormon church and the Government of
the United S:atea on the subject of po
lygamy. The only compact existing on
that subject is oetwte.i the people of
Ltah. acting through their representa
tives In the State constitutional conven
tion, and the people of the United States
represented by .... and Con
gress.
"I affirm positively that that compact
has been kept on the part of the people of
Utah. There is no attempt niaiie to re
peal or ar.nul the parts of the constitu
tion prohibiting polygamous or plural
marriages. There is no desire to disrupt
that compact with the United S;:itÂ»>s. The
Mormon church has never annulled the
compact, and has no desire to annul it.
On the contrary, the venerable head of
the church ha.* avowed his determination
to adhere to Its settlement on the ques
tion
â¢atlve to
-
â 
- â 
-
â 
"Let it be remembered that the hcrne
end family of that plural wife were estab
lished under the sanction ofâ to her â
holy church ceremony ar.d with the ip
proval cf all her people. The fountain of
the- evil was drted up. and the people of
the United States can bÂ» generous enough
to allow the streams that flowed from it
to tak.' their course unlo^t in the oblivion
of death. Some menâ the number Is few
and rapidly growing l^ss â who entered
lt:to plural marriage relations previous to
H>\ when the church formally and of
ficially discontinued such marriages, and
hence, of course, previous to the settle
ment of thÂ» question by the compact nf
our State constitution, nave felt It mor
ally blndir.sr upon their consciences to ful
fill obligations cf their marriace vows to
those polygamous families. This is the
only 'polygamy! that has existed in Utah
tince the admission of the State, or since
lsCÂ»). in fact.
"It is ialÂ«ely charged that the Mormon
church controls the politics of Utah anl
that the Representative from Utah was
nominated and elected by Mormon church
Influence. It is falsely charged that the
Mormon church leaders sought to have
Roberts elected to test the sentiment of
the people of the United States as to
whether Utah would be held to the agree
ment in the matter of the abandonment
of polygamous or plural marriages. This
Is too silly to require refutation."

ACCUSED OF
MANY MURDERS
â â¢
Notorious Midwife Is
Under Arrest.
â 
ST. LOUIS. Nov. IS.âThe Post-Dispatch
this afternoon says Mrs. Henry Bamber
gcr. a midwife living at 'Jl[Â» Chouteau ave
nue, has been arrested on a bench war
rant sworn out on information laid before
the Grand Jury, which charges that she
has kno\vl< dge of the murder of at least
three wonvn ar.'i th^ destruction of score*
of babies. â  The witnesses whose testi
mony. lh<? Post-Dispatch says, resulted in
Mrs. Baniberger's arrest are Lizzie Rie
ger, Mary Haar and the latu-r's married
tistr-r, all of whom have been In the em
ploy of Mrs. Bamberger as nurses.
Miss Rleger was a nurse at the Chou
teau-avenue house for three years. The
uthers preceded her. Miss Rieger left the
place one year ago on account of a diffi
culty with Mrs. Bamber>rcr"s son.
These ex-nurses have occupied the.
greater rart cf the time of the Grand
Jury during the last three days.
The Poti-Di;pa:ch continues:
"One witness alleges that the body of
Lyda Bessert of 2113 Madison street, who
disappeared from home in 1557, was buried
in the cellar in September of that year.
"Another witness declares that the body
of Miss Annie Z:minerrr.ann of Moline,
111., who died from a criminal operation,
was thrown into the Meramec River.
"The story related by the nurseÂ« Is al
most incredible. It deals with the dispo
sition of the bodies in a revolting manner
If all the allegations be true the home of
the accused is a veritable enamel house,'"
Five indictments were found against
Mrs. Bamberger late this afternoon by
the Grand Jury. One charges murder in
the first decree, three charge man
slaughter In the first and one in the sec-

The .majority of the hrire^ ran well at
San Mateo Park yesterday and afforded
excellent sport for those in attendance.
The course between Arrow a::d Beer
Brewer nearly proved fatal to the for
mer. After the ilrst hare was killed an
other started up and the tired dogs went
in pursuit. Four relief dogs were released
and met the hare and its pursuers in a
head-on collision. The hare and several
cf the do,j3 were thrown and Arrow wai
unable to get up. For a time it seemed
she would die on the field, but her trainer
and others worked over her and brought
her around all right.
Sliver Wing", owned by Irwin & Lyons
of Texas, made her first appearance here
and won handily from Dexter P. Lowe <&
Thompson's new dog Little Fullerton was
beaten by BorJen's Best. The hare fa
vored the latter in a short course.
Rigby beat St. Anthony, the favorite,
at 1 to 3. White Diamond beat Twilight

One of the features of the coursing to
day will be the match between J. O'Shea's

The regular army chaplains are much
put out In consequence of the nubllcition
recently In a morning paper of an article
reflecting on â  their courage and alleged
disinclination to serve in the Philippine*.
Chaplain Bateman of the Forty-fourth
Regiment, who served with distinction
throughout the Cuban campaign, and
whose courape and devotion to duty no
man will question, says that the" only
basis for the Flanderou.s artlolc was tho
fart that two chaplains had applied to b>
retired from the service upon being no
tified that they were to be ordered to Ma
nila. 1" â¢â¢ of these was an old man who
ha.l been serving at a small post for
years and was ne.irly blind, and the other
was afflicted with heart trouble to surh an
extent that he could not walk up a night
of Ftairs without ere.it distress. In both
instances, says Chaplain Bateman, the
men were totally incapacitated for duty
in the field as the result of old ape ami
Infirmities. With these two exceptions
the chaplains of the regular army have
not only not Bought to evade their duty,
but have unanimously expressed a wil
lingness to serve in th>Â» field, and in many
instances have brought outside influence
to bear with the War Department to en
able them to accompany their regiments
to Manila.

"The executive committee has done

will be done as soon as we get together,
which will be very early. The plan to
be adopted to secure memoershlo will
have to be decided upon for one thing. I
have an <dea that we can form some sort
of an association, parlor, lodge or what
ever it may be called. In every town In
the State and perhaps more than one in
the cities. Such organizations would
Kerve to keep the interest alive and would
also prove efficient to provide some of the
money that will be Indispensable to carry
on the work. Who is there in the State,
business Man. land owner or capitalist,
who Is not concerned in the irrigation of
our lands In the dry season? Who is
there who is bo short-sighted as to fail
to sco that the loss of many millions of
dollars results from one very dry season?
Once more, who Is there in the State of

apprehend that there Is no such person

visionary to think that we ought to pet

am persuaded it will be, for nil ..he gen

NATIONAL GUARD
REORGANIZATION
STILL GOING ON
The First Regiment's
Expectancy.
DELAY AS TO THE UNIFORMS
â¦
MOVEMENT TO TAKE ELECTIONS
OUT OF POLITICS,
The movement Inaugurated by the offl
cera of the old First Infantry Regiment
last week for the purpose of re
entering the service of the State
haa aroused a slight deprea of
enthusiasm In National Guard cir
cle*. The several companies that have
not yet had meetings for the purpose of
signing the muster roll will meet during
the early part of the week and it is ex
pected that before the close of the week
there will be sufficient names on each roll
to enable each company to return to duty
with the minimum number. Borne compa
panlcs expect to have an excess of the
minimum number, and the expectation is
that the rejriment as a whole will report
back with nbout 700 men. There haÂ« been
some complaint that the Governor did not
ellow the men the full 150 days as pro
vided by law, except the Governor in his
discretion caw flt to Khorten the time In
which to return. This would have al
lowed them until February. The Gover
nor, however, raw flt to curtail that tlmo
and order them to report by the 30th
Inst., and they will have to do bo if they
desire thru the time they curved in the
Philippines shall count as continuous ser
vice.
There 13 some difficulty as to the band
re-entering the guard with the First. The
officer* of the Firat California Volunteers
would like to have thÂ» band the regi
ment hud on the islands with It. but the
members eince their return have scat
tered over various parts of the State and
It is doubtful if It can be got together
again as tht band of the California First.
The matter of uniforms is occupying"
the attention of all who are anxious to
have the men uniformed as they should
be. The Governor has taken up the sub
ject of the award by Colonel Cutler and
Lieutenant Geisting of the uniform board
to two bidders at different priceÃ and he
has doclurod that such a contract shall not
stand. As long as that if> not settled thero
will be Â«lÂ»-lay in furnishing blouses for tho
men and there will not be any uniforms.
Th<Â» manner of awarding contracts for
uniforms has been the subject of much
talk. There arc those of the- opinion that
th<Â« board would have acted more wisely
If it had secured futflclent cloth of the
proper standard, buttons and BO forth and
Issued to each company its allotment ac
cording to needs, and then let a contract
to some rompr-tpnt individual to masiu
fi.~ture Into uniforms according to tho
*lz- of tho mm who are to wear them. In
stead of having uniform* mud" accord
ing to caMlron measurements. It Is
thought that under ?urh a system bettor
looking and fitting uniforms would be the
result. *
There is already porno talk about the
nerd of legislation for the puard. One
matter that will be called to the attention
of the next Military Committee of each
houhÂ«* of th<> Legislature will be the neces
sity of a'rhance In thÂ« manner of pro
viding commissioned officers for the sev
eral eompnni''*, or th*> Hold and the stiff.
As it Is now all the line officers are elect
ed for two years, nnd these in turn eloct
the majors, lieutenant colonel and th*>
colonel of a rfÃimnnt. It Is proposed that
the on'.y oClc-r to be elected shall be the
second lieutenant of the company, such
second lieutenant to be promoted first
when a vacancy occurs and then pro
moted captain, the senior captain pro
moted major, the senior major lieutenant
co:or.Â«-l. and that offirrr colonel, all to
hold during competency hiul good be
havior, ar.d to be retired at the age limit.
This It Is claimed would do away with
military politics and Insure nn pffectlvp
board of oflWrs. in earn regiment, and
th< n tli<? officers would feel a pride. know-
Ing th:Â«t promotion would surely follow at
tention to duty.
About 60 P<r cent of the officers of thÂ«
old First Infantry arc holding under com
missions which have expired, and there
will have m be elections for officers In
every company. Ten out of the twelve
captains will have to be elected.
Major Jansen. inspector of the Second
Brigade, will be a candidate for the posi
tion or captain of Troop A of that brigade.
He is a cavalry officer who *aw service
in that branch of tho tinny during the
wnr of the Rebellion, and If he secures
that position he proposes to make It a
flrst-cWa company.
Major Dorn. Judge advocate. Second
Brlcade. will preside at an election to be
held on the 27th Inst. for first and eecond
lieutenant of Company H of the Fifth In

BLOODY STORY

CORPORATION
Southern Pacific's An
nual Report.
KILLED 161, INJURED 1045
A ROAD THAT IS MORE DEADLY
THAN THE FIRING LUTE.
More Men Killed on Its Track Than
Were Slain in Action by Our
Foes During Twelve
Months.
The Southern Pacific Company yester
day handed in to the Railroad Commis
sion its report for the year ending Jun
20. IS9B. It roads more like the tale of a
military engagement than the staid, pro
saic schedule of a business concern, and
one perusing its columns will find that
It is safer to be on the Manila tiring line
than upon the line of the great railway
corpora
In actual figures there have been 161
souls sent Into eternity on the Southern
Pacific and 1045 maimed and disfigured for
Hie through intrusting themselves to a
careless management whose policy is to
count the dollars and forget the deaths.
It is no exaggeration to say that one is
safer on tho Manila firing line than in
the coaches of this company, for the
same le.igth of time shows a smaller loss
In action amid the swamps and thickets
of Luzon than Is represented by the com
pany's own figures In the statement it
yesterday presented for the consideration
of the Railroad Commissioners.
The report shows that these lives were
sacrificed for a gross earning to the
. 6 >Â«ckholders of the corporation of $43.
iÂ«>6,fr43^: that the operating expenses nec
essary to Insure such an enormous fa
tality amounted to $27.464.579 77: the in
come from this operating was 116,103. MS 51:
from other sources Jt.596.496 62: giving a
total income of J15.193.5C5 13 and a net in
come of J151.711 48.
The passenger receipts amounted to $14,
751,77S M and the freight receipts foot up
$28,225.722 45. These figures leave a Bur
plus of $3 119 436 IL
The authorized Issue of bonds is $200.
000,000 of which amount 747,314 have
been distributed among 309 stockholders.
The company employs In various ca
pacities 22.556 men at an '-rage dally
wage of S2 49. or a total expense In sal
aries of J16.?12.471 14 for the year.
During the year there has been hauled
2.Â£94,Â«73.Â»14 tons of fries. â¢ The distance
of the average haul has been 270 miles
and the average receipt 9*4 mills. /v
â \Vlth the Southern Pacific Company's
report those of the Central Pacific, the
Southern Pacific of California and the
Santa Ana and Newport railroads were
submitted. The total Income of the Cen
tral Pacific is given as Â»Â«.Â«57 'M* 82.
The Southern Pacific of California gives
?6.457.393 24 as Its total income, with $1,
21.542 36 net. Its total surplus Is $12,713,

The little Santa Ana and Newport road
Is doing very well Indeed. Its report
shows its cross earnings to be $47. "92 9S;
expenses, J25.341 70: Income from operat
ing, 122.061 25, and net income, $15,121 2S.

7T\\ state of humid nervousness, a
IL i\ stout, plethoric gentleman
Jj Won a table in the maple room of
the Palace Hotel last i â 
and attempted to tell humorous stories
and sell dolls.
Surrounding him were dolls of all sorts
and sizes. Large dolls, small dolls. Dolls
that were entering upon their first season
and ones that had been out so long that
the memory of man runneth ;.ot to the
contrary. Dolls that had long ago been
purchjy-Vd and dolls that were still wait
ing for the one who was to bid them in.
The prices that had been paid for some
and would be paid for others ranged all
the way from the check of the millionaire
up to the bond of honest affection, and,
strange to nay. the sales already recorded
had brought quite as many checks ns
bonds to the vault of Time, wherein the
gllt-edgrd securities ar.d the worthless
paper rested together.
These dolls were not the ones tho rotund
gentleman was auctioning off. but they
were the real show, nevertheless. They
were the ones that brought the crowd
that moved restlessly here and there, gaz
ing at the magnificent costumes and
gleaming Jewels and figuring on the worth
of the llgure they covered, and, to tell
the truth, in some cases ornamented.

CITY STREETS MUST
REMAIN IN DARKNESS
Relief May Be Obtained Only
by Creating a Deficiency.
Our Municipal Street Lighting Is Among
the Worst of Any Town in the
Entire United States.
THE problem of street lighting haa
l<.c:ne ft serious one for this city,
a:.J as thÂ« winter progresses the
question will inevitably Increase In
importance. For seven nights of
â very month of thirty days the city Is In
absolute darkness. All districts of San
Francisco are at the mercy of malefac
ton, and the winter is the season for the
operations of malefactors who ply their
trade at nieht. For seven nights In the
month there is not a light to be seen ex
cept those which are supplied by private
subscription or which shine from .he
shops of tradesmen. During the other
nights of the month the street lights, as
furnished, are utterly inadequate to a city
the size of San Francisco. Unless some
measures are Immediately taken to rem
edy this e\:\ It will continue during the
winter and subject the people of San
Francisco to countless inconveniences and
dangers.
From the point of view of street light
ing the city is a village. This crisis is the
result of the quarrel between the munici
pal authorities a:.d the gas company.
When the appropriations for the present
fiscal year were made not only economy,
but parsimony, wu displayed In setting
aside money for street lighting. The fund
for street sweeping was left undisturbed,
but that for street lighting was greatly
reduced. The gas company protested and
threatened, and when neither protest iior
threat availed the company carried into
effect the policy that Is now leaving San
Francis, o in darkness.
rtrst radical measure was to shut
off folly one-th'.rd of the street lights in
m Addition, This curtailment
Is for the entire month, and already It
has bred anxiety and fear In the district.
In the Mission the lights have not been
v ed except for the seven days that
the city Is left In utter darkness. Tbe
reason for this is that the residents of
the Western Addition are conservative
and have no improvement clubs, and the
Mayor, trho ChOM the localities In which
the lights must go out, likes Improvement
clubs.
After this general reduction tn lights
had been made another controversy arose.

H. Vrehoe. a mining man from Row

company contends that It should receive
11 cents. The matter has been under con
sideration for a month now. and the gas
company, having the whip haud. Is using
It. I'ntll the city comes to Its terms there
shall be no street lights for seven nights
in the month. This decision Is arbitrary
and hurtful to the city, but the gas com
pany has the power to make it.
Even if the city should agree to come to
the terms of the gas company, no very
great relief would be given. Even if the
gas company were paid 11 cents for each
light, the city would still be In darkness
for five and a half nights In the month.
Under the street lighting contract a pro
vision is foolishly made that the lights
shall not be lit for three nights In the
monthâ at full moon and a night before
and a night after. The sky may be ut
terly overcast, but if It be so at the time
of the full moon the lamps are not lit.
It Is evident, therefore, that no benefit
Is to be derived from a compromise with
the gas company. Many officials have
discussed the problem and offered sugges
tions, but that offered by Supervisor Per
rault aeems to be received with most
favor. He suggests that the outgoing and
incoming Boards of Supervisors be
pledged to create a deficiency in the street
lighting fund to cover the winter months
and to Insure the lighting of the street
lamps every night in the month. This
would relieve the city from the dangers
of darkness during the winter, and a Â«av
lng could be made In some other direction.
It Is utterly out of the question to
change now the appropriation for street
lighting for this fiscal year. It has been
fixed by law and cannot be changed. Tne
only avenue of relief therefore is to se
cure the permission r>f both Boar
Supervisors to create a deficiency in the
fund. As for the genera! question of street
lighting, there is but one opinion. As far
as the Illumination of Its street* are con
cerned San Frandseo is far behind the
times, and when Mayor I'helan begins the
operation of makltiK San Francisco the
Paris of Amerira he will find a splenl:d
field for reform and Improvement In the
street lights.
It Is claimed that gas lighting should
be abolished ar.i that electric lighting
should takÂ«Â» Its place. Th" main thorough
fares should be Illumined all night and the
residence districts until late in the night.
An all-night Illumination should also be
given to the districts where the criminal
e]r>monts congregate â in the alleys and by
ways of the city. Pan Francisco would
then be properly and adequately lighted
at night, but such reforms as these can
now r>e only matters of speculation. Ab
solutely nothing can be done until the be
ginning of the next fiscal year. In July.

Ilia body was buried at sea. He was a
native of England. Hoj".' was in the hos
pital ut Santos for about two weeks, suf
fering Hum eruption, thought to be
ecsema. He sailed with the steamer, and
alter several dajrs at sea complained of
piuns in his head, legs am! back. He was
put to bed In an exhuustt- 1 condition, and
on the second day deveLi-.l fever. The
captain treated him with such remedies
as the ship's medicine chest afforded and
i him with care until he died.
I '!â  arrival at quarantine the case was
reported to the lltaith Office, and in view
of the fact that the captain and cook,
who were in constant contact with the

â¢or: . â¢ â 
From Friday afternoon of the
10th Jnst. t>> last Thursday morning the
crew of eifrht. a!l told, clung: to the after
house, subsisting on a few raw potatoes
er.d what rain water they could catch In
tfrelr clothing:.
A mountainous sea waÂ« running, and
every wave that swept over the water
logged vessel threatened to er.d the strug
gle. The steamer Mackinaw hove In sight
but passed on her way to San Francisco
mthout making out the frantJc -â .:...:.:.!-â¢
cf the Faikenburg's crew. Two of tho sxil
crs gave way to despair and would have
Jumped overboard had it not been for the
captain. A few hour* later ihe Rteatner
Valla Walja showed up in the horixou,
ar.d Captain Hall wghung v.c ucreuct
bore down to it and took the sailors
tKiard and landed them Id San Francisco
yesterday afternoon.
The Jane A- Falkenburgr left Port Had
lock for San Francisco with a load of
lumber on October 17 last. Captain T. M.
:â '..::â¢:. was in command and J. Wheeden
!vai first officer and A, J. Anderson sec
ond Â©thcer. The erc-w consisted of four
caUors and a Chinese cook. The first
m-eek of the voyace passed without inci
dent, save that heavy southeasterly
weather prevented much progress being
made. On the night of November 9 the
gale began to increase, and on the morn-
Ing of the 10th it was blowing a hurricane.
The rain came down In torrents, lightning
flashes â¢ played constantly around the
doomed vessel and the thunder ktpt up a
i â¢:..-iant cannonading.
At this time the Fajkenburg was in lat
itude <5 degrees 39 minutes north, longi
tude 127 degrees west. She was v\atÂ« r
lopged. having sprung a leak several days
before this. Every moment she would roll
over until the crew never expected her to
come back again, and all hands were
itrmed with axea ready to cut away the
masts as soon as the captain gave the
word. Suddenly the deck load shifted to
starboard, and the order to cut was
Â«rlv\en. The rip.ging of the main and iniz
zen masts was severed and both mass
*ent by the Im-..: .. taking the foretop-
BUm with them in their faJL
This did not relieve the versel very
xnuih. and she refused to come back on an
even keel until thÂ« deck load went by the
board, taking the nmid*hip deckhouses
and boats with it. The waves were now
making clean breaches over the vessel,
vhilearaldshlp she was almost constancy
under water. The crew and the chip's cat
ell took refuge on the afterdeck house.
ar.d there they had to stay for six long,
weary days and nights until rescued by
the Walla Walla, once aboard that hos
pitable ship Captain Hall turned over the !
almost famished men to Chief Steward ;
Hume, and It did not take him long to
set a splendid meal before them. Captain
Mard*>n and his men lost everything thÂ« y
had â¬\c< pt the clothes they stood in. hut
they were not long aboard the steamer
b'-fore each man had h dry suit on.
â¢ - I have been up and down thÂ« coast a
few times." said Captain Mnrden yester
day, "but never did I encounter anything
like the southeaster that Mew the" night
of the Hh and all of th<Â» Kith. It was as
black as En-bus end rained In torrents.
The waves wore mountains high and beat
upon the poor little barkentino until she
tad to give up the battle.
â¢During tnr tarly Mates of h*r battle
trHh the elements the Falkcnburg sprang
c. leak, out that did not worry us much,
as. we were lumber laden and It was
easy to kÂ«-<p the water down. When the
ftorm burst on us In nil Its fury, how
ever, there was nothing left to do but
cut away the masts and trust in Provi
dence. At the last, there was no time to
rave anything In the shape of food
l*ucklly there were a r.uml.er of sacks
of potatoes and some oth^r vegetables
en the af'.crhouse and on these we lived
until picked up by the Walla Walla.
"When thÂ» Mackinaw .passed us a
couple of my men gave way to despair

To Open Nineteenth Avenue.
A meeting of property owners in Sunset

ing are: Charles W. Pope, president;
Charles H. Menton. vice president;
Charles H. Cushin, secretary: Carl G.
I^irsrn. treasurer; ex'-outlve committee
Ed Ewald. R. Keller and C. G. Larsen. It
is the intention of the club members to
solicit subscriptions from all the property
owners facing on the avenue for the pur
pose of planting park grass on the west
side of the boulevard, which will prevent
the sand from blowing on to the roadway
alter it has been graded and macadam
ized. To accomplish this a special com
mittee consisting of President Pope and
v ice President Menton was appointed to

PARTIES MAY DIVIDE ON
PHILIPPINE QUESTION
Hon. H. J. Budd Discusses the Prob
able Issues of the Next
Campaign.
FRESNO. Nov. IS.â Hon. H. J. Budd of
Knoxville, lowa, a cousin of Judge Budd
of Stockton and a member of the National
Democratic Committee, li spending a few
days In Fresno. His business here, he
says, â 'is what politicians call a family
secret." In discussing things political
with a Republican reporter this afternoon
Mr. Budd said he thought the important
plank of the Democratic platform next
year would be on the trust question.
"Our party will make an anti-trust
fight," said Mr. liudd. "Then will come
anti-imperialism and a stand in favor of
the Income tux. The election of Senators
by a direct vote of the people will also be
espoused by us. And in addition 1 might
say that the principles of the Chicago
platform will be reaffirmed, including the
plank in favor of bimetallism."
In legard to the war in the Philippines
Mr. Budd said: "So far as the Filipino
war is concerned. I think it is little short
of human butchery. But since we have
got into it I think we ought to keep It
up. No, I don't think. the war itself will
cut any figure in the next campaign. It
will settle Itself long before the campaign
opens. In fact, I think the Filipino war
Is about ended now." . â 
Mr. Budd thought that the question on
: which tin- parties would divide would bo
in regard to the disposition of the Philip
pines. He Bald the islands were inhabited
by a dwarfed race of human freaks, who
c< uld never be civilized and could never
accommodate themselves to American
customs. ,^___________^^

FATALLY SHOT BY THE
MAN HE TRIED TO KILL
George Ferris' Murderous As
sault on a Rival Bartender.
After Being Taken to the Receiving Hos
pital He Vainly Attempts to Swallow
a Large Quantity of Opium.
BU'SE he had lost his position
and believing thai the man who
had supplanted him wa.i hi.-j
enemy, Oorgo Ferris, a bar
der, last evening shot Jam^a
Cuddy, and wa.s himself wounded In thu
throat by a bullet fired by the individual
life he sought.
ThÂ« shooting occurred In a saloon kept
by Charles Johnson at 543 Howard street,
where Cuddy Is employed as bartender.
Shortly before â¢; o'clock last evening
Ferris, who is said to be an opium fiend,
visited the saloon accompanied by a man
whose Identity is at present enshrouded
in the deepest mystery. Cuddy was be
hind the bar, and as the men entered he
saluted Ferris and asked him If he de
sired a drink. Without offering a reply
Ferris closed the front door, while his
companion passed on to the rear. Sur
prised at the action of Ferris in shutting
the door. Cuddy, after ordering him to
open it and meeting with no response
started from behind the bar. Instantly
Ferris drew a revolver and fired at the
bartender. The bullet struck Cuddy in
the left forearm and emerged near the el
bow.
Realizing that Ferris Intended to mur
der him. Cuddy seized an old-fashioned
bulldog revolver which was lying under
the counter and promptly returned the
fire The first shot struck Ferris In the
throat, the bullet lodging In the back of
his neck. As he fell to the floor mortally
wounded Ferris again raised his revolver
and tired at his hated rival. The bullet
grazed his cheek, and running from be
hind the bar Cuddy, after taking delib
erate aim, attempted to forever tllence
his murderous assailant. To hi* sur
prise his revolver refused to work and he
retreated, expecting that Ferris would
continue to empty his pistol at him.
Just then Ferris, with blood flowing
from the wound In his throat, arose from
the floor and staggered from the saloon.
After placing a handkerchief to the
wound, hoping to stanch the flow of blood,
Ferris walked up Howard street to New
Montgomery and alone the latter street
to Mission. With the assistance of a
friend whom he had met in his futile
flight to escape the consequences of his
crime Ferris managed to reach his room
at 041 Mission street.
In the meantime Police Officers Laws
and Say of Captain Splllane's division,
who had heard of the shooting, started
after him. After considerable trouble
they traced him to the lodging house
where he roomed and took him Into cus
tody. He was found lying on the floor,
surrounded by a number of sympathizers,
who were vainly endeavoring to protect
him from the police. After having Ferris
removed to the Receiving Hospital the
policemen arrested the men who were In
the room with him. They were taken to
the City Prison and charged with va-
SI Ferr > is. when placed on the operating
table refused to discuss the shooting.
"I have nothing to say." he vehemently
remarked, when asked why he had at
tempted to murder Cuddy. "I got thÂ©
worst of it, and I don't Intend to squeal,
see?"
While the surgeons at the hospital were
preparing to dress the wound in Ferris'
throat the latter secretly took from his
pocket sufficient opium to kill three ordi
nary persons, and placed It in his mouth.
The act was witnessed by a visitor to the
operating room, who promptly notified one
of the doctors. Ferris vigorously en
deavored to swallow the opium and re
sisted the attempt of the surgeons to
force open his mouth. With the aid of a
"screw his jaws were finally unlocked
and the opium removed from his mouth.
GfcORGE FERRIS MORTALLY WOUNDED BY JAMES CUDDY
, Ferris afterward admitted that h- In- .
tended to swallow the opium. hoping to
end his existence. It Is doubtful whether
he will recover.
Cuddy willingly consented to teH fh*i
story of the shooting.
"Threw days ago," he said, when giving
his version of the affair, "the man wttrÂ».
tried to kill me lost his poMMon. .- -bar
tender In the saloon on Howard street.
The proprietor, with whom I am acquaint
ed, offered me the place, and as I was
broke I gladly accepted It.
"I had been working only a few-hourÂ»
when a friend of mine Informed me that.
Ferris was 'sore* and threatened to get
even with me. I paid little attention trÂ»
his threats, thinking that ho wsui Incensed
over the loss of his Job and that he. would
soon forget about It. Just before Â»ho
â hooting took place another friend told me.
that Ferris was In an ugly mood and was
making threats against my life. Thinking
that he might do something desperate. I
resurrected an old revolver, which had
been in the saloon for some time, and pre.
pared myself for any attack which he
might make. Scarcely had I placed thÂ«
weapon in a convenient plare under ttm
counter when Ferris and a companion,
whose name I do not know, entered th.Â®
saloon. I spoke to Ferris, and for a re
ply he whipped out a. revolver and flr-d
at me. Th" bullet struck me In the arm.
and reaching for my revolver I promptly
returned the fire. An he fell to th.Â« floor
he flred another shot at' me. the bullet
grazing my chrek. I then ran from be
hind the bar determined to do him or get
killed in the attempt. As I pointed my re
volver at him I was surprised to fir that
the trigger - would not- work. Just then
Ferris arose from the floor and staggered
from the saloon.
"Why he wanted to kill me I am st a
loss to explain except that he was mad
because I got his Job."
By ordef of Captain Spillane both men,
were charged at the City Prison with an
assault to commit murder.
The proprietor of the saloon where trie
shooting occurred says that Ferris. slnc*Â»
he was forced to dispense with hlÂ» ser
vices, has been looking for trouble. â¢
"Only last Friday." he remarked, "he
visited my saloon and. finding a boy on
watch, threatened to shoot him and then
wreck the place. Yesterday afternoon I
learn. that Ferris was In a d^.tperatn
mood and threatening to 'get even with
me. I warned Cuddy to look out for him
as I was satisfied that he intended to*
harm him. A fÂ«w minutes before th*
shooting occurred I saw Ferris stand. ns;
In front of my plare of business and sus-
ting .hat he was looking for trouble
I notified the policeman on the beat.
While we were conversing Ferris en
, tered the saloon and shot Cuddy. I wan
satisfied that he was addicted to the us*
of opium and for that reason I was com
pelled to f.:scharge him. Cuddy wtg
given his place and I suppose that Fer
ris, thinking he had influenced me to dls
pense with his services, determined- to
take his life." ' .â 
The men found In Ferris* room endeav
oring to secrete him from the police
and who were arrested and charged with
vagrancy are James O'Brien, rigar
maker: Fred Foster. laborer; Tom KeJly.
Ironmolder: Richard Bums, bo|lermakÂ»r;

OREGON'S LIGHT ELEVEN GIVES CALIFORNIA
ITS SEVEREST STRUGGLE ON THE GRIDIRON
California 12, Oregon 0.
THE people who crowded the stands
on the west side of the University
of California gridiron and shouted
their throats dry yesterday at the
football game between the Califor
nia and the Oregon elevens saw the hard
est-fought battle of the season The
much-heralded Hlue and Gold team was
put upon its mettle" and the two touch
downs, earned after th*' most arduous
and fiercest play, bespeak a world of
praise for the young students of the Ore
gon State University.
California is to-day the strongest eleven
In this State, ami an easy victory was
prognosticated for the Blue and Gold. It
was anything but that. Again and again
would the stalwart California backs come
at the Orepon line, and small gains WOUld
mark the course. Oregon was 157 pounds
to the man and California was 173. and this
In football affairs means something. Al
though the local team Is but of average
weight, the members of It appeared gigan
tic when faced against their much lighter
opponents.
California also rested on a football
training of fifteen years, while the Ore
gfinlans arc still In the Bristle. And with
nil tl;e.Â«e natural advantages the Hlue and
Â«;<>ld could cross the Oregon goal line but
twice. Once. In the second half, the visit
ors were nfteen yards from the goal posts
of the home â  ..m. but there they took
reÂ»ot and moved no farther. It was the
only scare of the day for California, but
It drew forth gasps from some and impre
cations from others.

son, formerly a tackle e>n one of Califor
nia's representative elevens, looked out
for the Orejfonians. HÂ«Â» hns be*en coach-

mits are pictured In the playing of his
team. Roth elevens came in for an equal
share of applause, as did the coaches. The
a rush. While the Harvard men -id not |
appear to have lost strength It was no- '
tlreable . hat the Yale men were more
active. They played with greater ppeed

They literally ripped nnd tore thrnuch

SAFE- CRACKERS
PREPARED JOB
AT OIL WORKS
Fuse and Caps With

The discovery of dynamite at the Stand

followed by another discovery of hardly

to destroy the ofllee, wreck the safe and
take whatever coin could be obtained
amid the wreck.
The Police Department was completely
mystified this morning when it read in
The Call all the tails of the secret plot
to wreck the oil company's plant and loot
its safe. Chief Hoduklns says that the
material discovered by the police shows
that a very complete job was arranged.
Ho is of the opinion that had the discov
ery not been made the miscreants would
have pone to the scene Saturday mid
night and have carried out their Inten
tions.
The â  - enca of so much dynamite does
not justify any theory that the wrecking
of the enfe was all that was contem
plated, for twentieth of the amount
found would have Mown the door of nriv
safe to splinters. The outfit consists Â«>f

years as.>, art' fading away. The suits,
which were brought to recover 18000 bal
ance due on legacies in each case, prom
ise to bo bitterly fouc.'.t.
The basis of the suits is an alleged dis
covery of an error In the Bacon will. Ac
cording to the interpretation of the execu
tor* the will provided bequests of "two"
thousand dollars each to plaintiffs, but
the latter have had the will photographed
and allege that the word "two" is in re
ality "ten."
It had been stated recently that the
matter of the claimed balance of JS'XK) duo
these two devise would be compromised.
However, last Wednesday a supplemental
complaint was Bled in the cause, and to
day the defendants filed a significant de
murrer that would indicate that they pro

tack by pleadings before the vital ques

subject of the actions; recites that
neither the complaints nor the supple

constitute a cause of action against de

cause of actions as set forth In the orig

ANOTHER TIE
GAME CLOSED
BY DARKNESS
Sacramento and San Francisco
Put Up Ten Innings of
Sensational Ball.
â¦ + â¦ + â¦ + â¦â¦ + â¦â¦ + â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦
I SACRAMENTO 4, SAN FRANCISCO 4. +
"â¦â¢ TEN INNINGS.
H.+++++++ + + + + + + + +
In the ten innings played at Recreation
Park yesterday afternoon the San Fran
ciscos and the Sacramentos furnished
enough excitement and real live baseball
to thrill the breast of the moat cold and
critical follower of the national game.
Three times th" score was tied, the last
time belns in the ninth Inning when two
men were out and when San Francisco
had victory within Its grasp. Henry Krug. j
the clever but erratic shortstop for the I
local nine, won and lost the game for his
team nnd now his smile has left his beam- j
Ing countenance. He lined the ball out
at he proper time, scored a run himself,
made some clever catches and Just when .
he was ready to quit the gameâ with the
supreme satisfaction of knowing that he
had done wellâ Mclaughlin sent a ground
er to him and In his eagerness to field It
he fumbled, the runner was safe and
Shanahan crossed the plate, tiring the j
score and necessitating an extra Inning. |
The shock almost put "Ham" Iburg out
of the business. His face took on a look
of weariness and he sadly shook his head
at Krug and thought "what might have
been." and as for your "Uncle Henry."
he hung his head and wei I It was a sad
awakening from a dream of victory, but .
It is the fortunes of baseball.
Charley Doyle was put In by Sacramento !
to pitch. He deserves a great deal of
credit for his work in the box and also i
for the grit he displayed in playing tho
game with a fractured fibula. In the sixth
inning BrockhoS lined the ball right at
Doyle and It was so sudden that the lat
ter" could not step aside and the bail
struck him in the rlsrht leg. Despite the
pain Doyle gathered the ball up and J^hot
It over to first, but Brockhoff proved too
speedy a runner and landed on the ba.Â«r
just p.liead of the sphere. Doyle Hmpetl
throughout the rest of the game, bu^ his
pitching was as even as in the first *part
of the contest.
San Francisco was first to score. In
the fourth Krug singled, stole second and 1
scored on Sullivan's single. In the follow
ing Inning Sacramento evened matters
and went the locals one better. Stanley
singled, was forced nt scond by Doyle
and the latter scored on Sheehan'a two
bagger past third. Stultz flew into nhort
right. and Reilly Instead of allowing Hil
derbrand to take the fly tried to gather
it himself. As a result of his muffing the
ball Sheehan scored. In the sixth both
nines tallied, but in the seventh the locals
had things all their own way. Couttney
hit to short and beat the ball to first and
reached home on Eagnn's bad error of
Rellly's grounder. Rellly reached second
on the throw In and beat the ball to third
after Pyne's fly had been captured by
Shanahan. He repeated this a minute
later when Muller flow to Harvey. Har
vey made a beautiful throw home, but a
second too late to land the agile second
baseman of the San Franciscos. In their
half of the seventh Sacramento managed
to get three men on bases, but through
good fielding not a man crossed th. plate
Nothing was done until the last of the
ninth, when Bhanahan flew to IMIly who
again muffed, and the runner was ad
vanced by Shechan's sacrifice Stultz
rolled out And with two strikes on him
IfcLaughltn hit to Km?, who made the
error already alluded to. Harvey reached
first on a sing c and Mclaughlin was put
ou: v
In the home N.-ither team did anything
in the tenth arvt the game wns called on

begin active preparations for the national
rifle tournament which will be held here.
In 1901. Over a year ago the bund at the
conclusion of the big tournament on Long
Island, New York, decided to hold the
next event at San Francisco, and nearly
all the best riflemen of the country prom
ised to attend. As soon as that decision
was reached the local rifle clubs sent
delegates to a meeting and tne new bund
was created. Nothing has been done since
on account of the officers of the old or
ganization delaying the forwarding of
their reports, records, archives and med
als, left over from the last meeting.
Among the Arions who recently visited
this city were a number of members of
the national organization, to whom the
situation was explained, and upon their
return to New York they hurried up mat
ters. Recently word was received from
the East that the property of the bund,
money and all. had been forwarded and
would soon arrive here. R. Finking, pres
ident of the local representation, will is
sue a call to-morrow for a meeting.
As soon as the members are familiar
with the workings of the bund they will
be appointed on committees to advance
thÂ« business to a successful end. The
bund tournament will last a week or ten
days. In addition to the riflemen coming
from all parts of the East, there will be
many from this coast. Beside? a dozen
or more rifle-shooting organisations In
San Francisco, there are clubs in I^os
Angeles, Azusa, Sonora, San Diego, San
Jose, Sacramento, Stockton, "Woodland
and clubs In some of the smaller towns of
the State. Washington, Oregon, Nevada
and even British Columbia are expected
to contribute to the attendance.

SEEK REFORMS
IN CONDUCT OF
LABOR BUREAU
Is More Ornamental
Than Useful.
WORKING CUSSES TO ACT
..ILL APPEAL TO LEOISLATUBE
rOH SOME RELIEF.
Claim That the Bureau Should Be
Converted Into a Medium to
Brinfr Tog-ether Employer
and Unemployed.
. Organized labor and the working classes
generally are r.ot convinced of the useful- ;
rifss of the State Labor Burea.u as con
ducted by Fred V. Meyers, Governor
G_gu'Â» appointed -vÂ« Labor Commissioner.
The advihabillty cf appealing to the Leg
l*!ature for a ri-construction of the law
: otY-ttlBC the oSioe is being seriously dis
cussed by j !.Â«â  loaders of the laboring
chin***. It U clu_med that since Governor
Oaj4Â« ix-gan U* parcel out the loaves and
â l;Mie*i n> the fxiliiSul the ottVe ha_s be
icihie'a po!itic_J fiuocure Instead of a
' practical U-nelit to the workinginen.
. Cumiiarlsons arc Lelng drawn between
Ml Slcjiri and his predecessor, H. L.
Kltzg**raid. sÂ»jid thf result has not been
one of Kiory to Mr. Gages appointee.
There Is au undercurrent of dl.^satisfac
. tlon that the new Lubur Commissioner
t-hould have allowÂ«Â»d the reforms Inaugur
ated by his predecessor to die of Inanition.
They feel that the man who Is at the head
of the State Labor Bureau should keep
J:lmsÂ«elf in touch with labor, should LaM*
h:* statistics upon thorough aiid careful
Investigation, and should make the otllce
en lmp<>ni_nt factor ln benefiting and ur
n the working classes.
They are convinced that as the ofncÂ« is
I run at present It might just us well lÂ«e
clopod for all of the good It is doing. No
Â«sTi>rt, however, will be made to have the
office abolished, liven though its only
Junction Just nuw appears to txj that of a
consumer of taju-s. thÂ« laboring people
Jeel that it can be so reconstructed that
*ome return will be received for t;iÂ« sal
_tr;< s that are paid.
The labor organizations believe thnt the
ftatistlcs concerning labor are not nearly
es important as the. establishing of a me
dium through which the employ Â«t and the
unemployed can lÂ»e brought together. Fol
lowing this Use, they will ask the legis
lature to convert the LÂ»abor Bureau into a
free employment bureau, with branches
tit all 01 thf important labor centers of
the State. They want statistics to be of
secondary importance to the securing of
employment for every white man who de
tires to work.
This was one of the reforms started by
rx-I_ribor Commission* r FitzgeraJd and
the pood It accomplished wa-a never ques
tioned. The forces of labor assert that if
they must be satisfied with statistics until
something better conns, they deserve to
have something reliable. They claim that
the figures furnished now by the Lalmr
JJureau do not in any way present a true
or Intelligible Idea of the labor situation.
It was hoped that Mr. Fitzgerald's suc
cessor would do something for laJ-or and
jnakf his ofllce useful instead of orna- j
mental, but as this hopÂ© has been shat
tered the workinginen have about decided
to appeal to the lawmakers for come re-
TAXES PAID UNDER PROTEST.
Another Corporation Thinks Its As-
sessment Too High.
The Pacific Gas Improvement Company
paid the sum of JIC.SW to Tax Collector
Fh*-fhon yesterday, accompanied by a
XTrotest to the effect that the assessment
of the corporation is void as to i;s fran
chise in the cum of J1.5T3.T21. which it is
alleged Is J1.000.0u0 ln excess of tho full
cash value of the franchise. The claim
Is founded on the grounds that the sum
lif^ij-j-ed is excessive und is at a greater
rate than â¢!.Â« *uÂ»&etÃu;'.-i.t of other similar
irarirhises.
H<nry T. Scott and Charles E. Grr^n. as
iru.-irdians of the estates of Mary Crocker,
Charles T. Crocker and Jennie Adeline
<"rockÂ«r. paid the Fum of lIO.CSS or., the
f'.m installment of personal property
taxos, also under protest. They claim
that thf assessment levied to the extent
<if. JC^t.<Â»O'i and the taxes amounting to
n~S are void because the $200,000 was as
*Â«Â»fd )>y Assessor Dodge as the value of
twenty :irKt mortgage C per cent gold
I)o:j<Js of the Park and Oc<Â»an Railroad
Company and Â£!3 first consolidated mort
(Sfil Per cent gold bonds of the Market
nr'ct Itailway.
The claim is mnde that the honds are
the mortgage t><>nds of California corpora
tions secured by mortgages upon their
properties, which have already been aÂ«
Â»hÂ»-m<1 liy the Assessor at T!:Â«:r"full valu<?.
T.h^r-fore the minors should not l>e com-
I-Hl*Â»d to pay ns the first installment of
taxes any greater film than $12.4.V00L
Tax CnlU-ctor f-heehan yesterday !n
fnrn-iM tho banks that he would be un
eble to accept a bond as security for the
payment of taxes on bonds, stocks, etc.,

JAPANESE ABE
MUCH PLEASED
WITH CHITOSE
Accept Cruiser Before
Contract Expires.
The Japanese Government Is more than
pleased with the cruiser Chito?e and has
to notified the Union Iron Works. Ac
cording 10 the terms of the contract the
builders were to keep the ship in first
class order for a year and at the end of
that time the vessel was required to
make her contract speed. The year will
not be up until March next, and In order
to keep the builders up to the mark $46.
000 of the contract price was retained un
til the vessel was finally accepted.
By the Nippon Maru. which arrived
here from Yokohama a tow days a^o. the
Union Iron Works received a check for
the $46,000 and a notification from the
Japanese Government that the vessel had
proved so thoroughly satisfactory in
every detail that she would be subject to
no more tests.
The contract for the building of the
Chitose called for a speed of 20^_ knots
with natural draught. Before finally ac
cepting her the Japanese Government
gave her a thorough test and she easily
made 21Vi krots under natural draught.
Under a forced draught she made _C.Ti5
knots an hour, beating the record made
on her trial trip, It is no wonder there
fore that the Japanese Government is
more than sutislied and the Scotts ore
pleased. '
Gray & Mitchell's new steamer Des
patch had her trial trip on the bay yes
terday. bhe Is a very handsome vessel
and well luted for the coast trade, into
which Bhc will gr> at once.
The friends of Ed French, the popular
chief engineer of the transport Warn
are all wondering to-day how he came
out in his encounter with the goat last
j night. He will have to be prepared to
answer a lot of questions when he reaches
I the front -duv.
SWITCHMAN GEIGER.
, Swept Off the Ladder of a Freight
Car by a Lamp Post and
Killed.
Blame 1* laid upon a street lamp post
for the violent death of William C.
Geiger. a railroad switchman, who died
at the Southern Pacific Company's hospi
tal, corner of Mission and Fourteenth
streets, last Thursday.
Testimony at the Coroner's inquest yes
terday showed that Geiger was standing
â  on an upright ladder fastened to the side
of a freight car and was signaling with
his lantern for the engineer to back up.
This was in the railroad switching yards
at the corner of Fourth and Townsend
ctreets. As the train was backing the
lamp post, which was within sixteen
inches of the track, swept Geiger off the
ladder and hurled him violently to the
ground, inflicting upon him internal In
juries which caused his death the next
day.
The Jury returned a verdict that the
dr-ath of Geiger "was the result of an ac
cident caused by striking a street lamp
post situated within sixteen inches of the
track: and we recommend that the dis
tance be widened between the said lamp
post and the said track for the safety of
the Â°i n<?r employes of the Southern Pa-
I cific Company."

HENRY HOLMES HAS
HIS OWN TROUBLES
THE SYMPHONY LEADER FILES
HIS INTENTION.
Could Not Join the Union Nor Con
duct Unless He Became an
American Citizen.
That talent alone Is not sufficient to In
sure artistic success ln San Francisco was
demonstrated to Henry Holmes, the fu
ture symphony leader, ln a forcible man
ner. It seems that the Musicians' Union
here has rather a monopoly on things mu
sical and the public Is a factor which
never comes into consideration' when the
musicians' own Interests are at stake.
This may be all ripht for the musicians,
but as to the public It Is another matter.
This, however, is not the cane at issue. In
order to he permitted to conduct sym
phony concerts Mr. Holmes WM iuskt-il to
Join the Union, fT which purpose he had
to pay the sum of J'-5. Seeing the wisdom
of complying with this request. Mr.
llnlm<*s directed his footsteps toward the
uarters of the Musicians' Union,
and, arrived there, applied for admittance
in the ornutlxation. You nay, however.
Imagine nil surprise when he was told
that admission will be refused him as long
as he do.-s not fil<- his intention of becom
ing a citlxen of the United States.
Mr. Holmes' consternation was so much
more severe as he had been a faithful sub-
Jecl <>f the Quo+ri for many years and now
when arrived at a respectable ape he was
asked to forswear his allegiance to his

There were only a 'â¢â¢â¢â  of* them, but

of the Forty-sixth, the soltllon were torn
from the apr string* of their Boston
m.-immn* In order to oniJ^t, and when
they took the train for Pan Francisco
they knew little more of the great world
than can bo seen over the brim of a silrer
and nionoirrammpd mug. That wu the
first week of September.
Not until they reached San Francisoo
did their blg-eyeÂ«l innocence change. "Baa
Francisco was too much for them." says
Captain Luken*.
"They were too much Cor us." says Baa
Francisco.
"You have been such Rood boys that
you may have more privileges than la
unual,'! t their colonel told them as th*
porter lifted them, up-a-dalsy, from the
rr<iu big dicta pu-p of trie train.
Then he turned them looeo upon as. Too
know the rest.
Whether they have learned or taught
will never Â»â â¢â¢ Fettled. At any rate, they
have made merry so fiercely within our
gate* that a provost guard has been need
. Ed to patrol our most festive streets both
night and day, rounding up any members
of the regiment whenever and wherever
found without a pass. Private houses
alone are not for the guard to search.
Captain I.ukens and lieutenant Rosa
remained In the ofllce of the California
street police Htatlon. It la headquarters
for the provost*.
"Come. Ross; we had better go ana
patrol. There are only twelve men out
to-night, you know." The captain spoke.
"I want my dinner. I've been patrolling
without a meal mice breakfast, and It's
â¢ now. I -don't want to go," answered the
lieutenant.
He waa very younff and T*ry hungry.
The. captain hnd eaten, but It would have
been the tame If he had not. He wu
plainly the kind of young man whoa*
obituary cannot exasperate.
"It Is better for us to keep together,"
said Captain I.uk. us.
"Just as you say." said Uentanaaa
Kom.
Bo we started.
"No guns?" N
"Ouns no more, A burglar might mm w*H
wear a headlight. We tried guns at first.
but we missed more of the Forty-sixth
escapes that way than we can catch be
fore our transport sails on Monday They
ootild tell us a block away and hide as

"But what are you going to do In caaÂ«
some of them are not polite â bout beina
caught?" Our part]) had come for the
purpose of seeing a merry war. and I
preferred that the war should not be all
on one side.
Captain taken* looked secure. "Bee
here," ho said, stopping under a Kearny
street lamp, "this doesn't show, but it's
ready for emergencies. "
It was a bayonet borrowed for the occa
sion. Out of sight In the Fcnbbard it lay
glittering and crafty. "We can use It as
a knife if necessary." lie said, "or the oth^
er end makes a pood club."
He slipped it back, drew his poncho up
against the drizzling rain, and strode on
"It's pretty tame, on Kearny street."
apologized the lieutenant. "Walt until
we get into Chinatown."
Shops and restaurants diminished along
the street, and the underground allure
ments looked dreary and dingy enough
to be harmless. Drunken soldiers now
and then broke the stolid monotony, but
never one of the Jolly Forty-sixth. Hence
It was not for our patrol to look for
them.
"You Just wait." repeated the lieuten
ant, hopefully.
Then we turned a sharp corner at
Broadway, twirled at random-drawn
angles, and found ourselves at the upper
end of Dupont street.
A clatter of wooden voices, a fishy whiff
and a glimmer of swaying red lanterns
bespoke Chinatown. An Instant before
there had been Latin faces, Latin sounds, j
The change was as sharp as the slam of
a* door. â  " - â¢ - '
Chinatown swarmed thicker an<l thicker
as the blocks went by. It mas single tile
and a Jostle at that. Yellow jÂ»-o[>le
crowded on corners and glided beiwt-.-n
ua, and smaller yellow people rose every
where from the ground on purpu.se to be
stepped upon. Now and tht^n a big-foot
woman patted softly by. tired of b >dy
and vacant of mind. A d'>pe fiend sneaked
up an alley nnd slid pj.-t us, hugging a
rapped coat about him. Hut no soldiers.
"You wait." said the lieutenant ono*
more.
"Who's that?" muttered Captain Lukens
on tl.o Instant
â² mhlsklng glimpse of uniform appeared
hn!f may tip the alley from which the
dope fiend had appeared. It vanished as
qul.-kly in a doorway where one dim
llÃlit hung low. The captain darted after.
Evidently the owner of the uniform had
vanished without plan or knowledge of
danger, for he appeared In the same door
may a moment later. "Come on. Bcott.
thl^ ain't the place I thought It was."
me heard him say. And from somewhere
In the blackness Bcott came on.
"Scott:" whispered the captain Joyfully.
The lieutenant stayed behind with us.
"Srott> the very one hÂ« told me to
day ho mas after.' 1 he explained "Bcott
belongs to his company and he's worth
taking the trouble fo find, though that**
not true of must of 'em."
There was a sudden oath, of surprise,
a start, a dash down * cross alley and
nothing to Â»cc or hear for a minute.
Then voices returned Captain r.ukens

Then he caught bight of a suspicion la

Ing his capture with the lieutenant. Their
voices rose as he vanished.
"Aw, we're not goin* with you."
"Come on. felluhs."

Miss Miles declaring that "tn. only way
to in anything Is on foot."
Mrs Miles consented trÂ» tell briefly of
her daughter*! courtship. ''Captain RÂ«b
er's mother In my M- cousin." >-a!<l Mrs.
Miles, "so ha and Cells have itlwnva
ailed each other cousins, th.'UKli the re.
latlonshlp, three times removal, is Â«'iit of
the cousinly limits. JudÂ»;e I'.-o.r nnrt M*
family live In .-â¢ Louis, anÂ«l w.- often ex
change visits.
â¢I don't believe In planning such things.
so we never gave a thought to tho young
people marrying. But when they them
selvea proposed It, of course Wt "'â¢ de
lighted. Captain Iteber Is n most promis
ins; officer, brilliant and manly, itnd loth
thÂ« general and myself aH fond and
proud of him."
Way down In Its democratic heart the
American public Is glad that this daugh
ter of th*< regiment has not wandered out
of the fold of the Stars and Stripes. Then*
Is a snobbish hue and cry when an Amer
ican girl becomes aPuchesx or a Prince**.
Bur Uncle Sam really never says half as
heart felt a "bless you. my children" over
these titled unions. TVhen 11 girl of posi
tion and wraith escapes the title taint,
she's twice as popular as her crown
craving sister. And that's why HIM
Miles can't keep out of printâ thÂ« public
Insist on having her.
The expression of those sentiments
called forth Mrs. Miles' opinion on for
eign marriages. It was then that she saM
that American women are as a rule hap
pier when they marry American men;
that the foreign point of view does not
adjust Itself to our manner of thinking.
"I have known of MOM happy marriages
under tho*e circumstances." Mrs. Miles
continued, "but I do not believe they arÂ«Â»
very frequent. We brlnV our girls up to
expect attentions that the foreigner is not
educated to givlnr
"Do I think th* American gtrl a wee bit
spoiled? Of course I don'tâthat hi not
the typical American girl. Our women ara
so versatile, so adaptable. The same
woman who can preside so gracefully at
a dinner could. If necessary, cook that
dinner."
When Mr*. Miles was Mary Sherman, a
little Washington schoolgirl. the Civil
War brought keenly home to her the fact
that she. was the relative of a general.
She felt thÂ« anguish of war's uncertainty,
child though she was. and learne.d thÂ« les
son that a solders women folks must
con with breaking heartsâthat death
hovers over a battlefield and may Ms)k
out their loved ones.
Early In the 70s Mary Sherman was
married to Captain Nelson A. Milâ Bha
was a child In rears, but with a woman's
strength of character. Nice** of .i gÂ»n
eral she stepped down with her husband
to the captain's rung on the army ladder.
Captain Nelson Mill - <ltÂ«l not win pro
motion away from th,Â» whizz of bullets.
Wherever the red man skulked and
scalped he went. His reputation aiÂ« an
Indian fighter grew-he advanced quickly
until a general's shoulderstrap* decor
ated his uniform. Finally he stood on the
topmost rune of the tojimÂ«->t ladderâhe
was (leneral N"elÂ»on A, Miles, commnnnVr
of the United States army.
In the almost S<Â» years of her marri-'i
life .Mrs. Miles has lived at fort* desira
ble and unOeslrahle. Mrs. Mi> . has
moved her household goods from army
posts In the torrid south to arSA] posts
in the frozen north. But she never ac
companied the general on hlÂ«* campaign*.
"If a woman shares her husband's dan
ger," says Mrs. Miles. "shÂ« 1m simply add-
Ins; a burden of unnecessary worry to
him. It does neither of them a bit of
good; simply Incrtases the worry for
both.
"Did I not go to Porto Rico with my
daughter? Oh. yes; but Â»c Joined the
general after the campaign was over."
Mrs. M. â¢ .-> expresses her views on this
subject most positively. It Is a notlceaHe
fact that the women who have gone to
the scene of action are for the most part
wives of volunteer officers.
Before- spring trips on the heels of win
ter General and Mrs. Miles will have a
son-in-law. Sherman Miles, hard at his
studies, preparing for West Point, Will
have a brother-in-law. The daughter of
the commander, like her mother before
her. Is marrying a captain. Will he. too.
rise to the position of commander of tha
army?
In army circles they say "Why not?"

Come along and don't make a fuM."
The private started obediently. "Are
you goln' to leave me like that. Charlie?"
put In his companion. "Won't you lay
good-by?"
Charlie rallied his forces.
"Here, what'm I goln' 'lth you for?"
The lieutenant jerked him to the stairs.
"We don't want a row," he said.
The Jf'.rl was ready to retire, but
Charlie's chivalry was awake. "Yuh
nee'n tuh think I'm coin' to leave jroo,
darlln'," he shouted. "Some people don't
know their business, but 111 teachâ em."
He was on the street by this time, and
fighting.
ll'll1 I'll club you if you don't look out."
commenced the younger provost. Put hÂ»Â»
did not mean to do so. and It would never
have happened If Taylor had not nhown
himself across thÂ» street. Taylor was an
other of the person* wanted.
The captain dropped Charlie Â»nd mad*
after him. The fresh air had made Char-
He's eyes clearer and his fist steadier,
and he u:ls hound to fall fighting. Henco
the lieutenant found that his prize was
not easy.
The Guard drew his bayonet. Then we
saw Its use as a club.
He had fall power to DM the weapon nÂ«
a knife in case of necessity, but that case
seldom arises. It did not now.
Back under the red ami white globe of
the police station we went to sep the md
â¢if affairs. A party of five ontente.l
Chinamen passed us. with an officer ho.
hind them. They entered; advanced down
the hall, facins the Ironical "Welcome"
that eneers from under the clock, and
turned forward to the prison-leading
stair* without guidance.
In the n> xt crll to their* we found our
arrests. They lay on tho benche* or
leered through the bars, nn.l were brazen
and not ashnmÂ«<l.
"We must look pretty In here."
ThosÂ».- Who had tobacco smoked and
tried to be unconcerned. They all Jokrtl.
And they wore in n barÂ»Â» cell of a city
prison, side by side with gambling <*hi
nese and drunken thieves. Their mothers
and sisters in the Kast are lamenting the
dangers of active battle.
Before midnight they were brought up
stairs ur.d started toward the Presidio
with the guard. The length of the I'nion
street car lint- found none unruly, for even
Charlie had mibsto><]. now that gallantry
proved Impossible. *
It was a muddy march over th* slopes
to tho guardhouse. Black and lonely as
disgrace It Mami* th.ro nnd opens doors
to . th. willful .in-l ihr foolish and th*
wicked. Some of them will lose n month*
salary and some will pay a 110 fine an-1
some will ,w ndur f a short Imprisonment.
Now and then there is dishonorable dis
charge.
And all because, â¢ays the captain, a
regiment of prettily behave,! m!?e boys
drew no salary from the rtrst of Septem
ber to the firm of November anrl then
drew morÂ« than was good for them all
at once. Especially since they came Into
possession of it while they were turned
loose in San Francisco.

of sable are the swellest and richest,
and only the. wealthy can afford them.
Sable is the fur which really wears well, and
If one can afford It, It pays to buy a little of
It In preference to a large amount of cheaper
fur. One of the awellest garments seen this
reason Is a short Jacket made of sealskin, with

The be-mlllloned woman finds a good

But the unfortunate who must count her

J There are several reasons why furs are so dear to the
heart feminineâ man, by the way, holds them dear, too,

But If my lady convinces others of the
logic of her arguments, she never for a

wants the fur, and If she were Immune to

For when it comes to furs a woman's
ways are dark and mysterious. She must
possess them though she live In a latitude
that will not permit wearing them.

no Imitations "Just as

The craft of man never fashioned a skin

CHAPTER VIII.
Social circles at West Point at long,
rare Intervals are shocked by a scandal,
and at short onesâ say every other sum
mer-^ stirred by some kind of a sen
patlon, and the "Fairy Sisters" were the
sensation of the year "97. They came la
July; they went in September, and mean
while, they were "on (he go" as they
expressed It. from morn till late at night.
Physically they were the lightest weights
known to the hop room. Mentally, as
their admirers in the corps â¢ (pressed it.
"cither of them can take a fall out of
any woman at the Point," and this was
especially true of the elderâ Mrs. Frank
Garrisonâ whose husband was on staff
duty In th<} far West. Both were slight,
fragile, tiny blondes with light blue eyes,
with lighter, fluffy hair, with exquisite
little hand* and feet, with oval, prettily
shaped faces, and the youngerâ the maid
en sister, had a bewitching nnuth and'
regular, snowy dots of teeth of which aha
was Justly proud. Yc-t. as has been pre
viously said of Mrs. Frank, while the
general effect was in the ease of each
iliat of an extremely pretty young girl,
the elder had no really good features,
the youngr r only that one. They generally
dressed very much alike. ln light, flimsy
gowns, and hats, gloves and summer
shoes all of daxsllng whiteâ sometimes
verging for a change to a creamy hueâ
but colors, except for sashes or summer
shawls, seemed banWied from their ward
robes. They danced divinely, said the
corps, and preferred cadet partners, to
the joy of the battalion. They rode fear
lessly and well, and had stunning hats
and habits, but few opportunities for dis
play thereof. :They came tripping down
tl;e path from the hotel every morning,
frerh and fair as daisies, in time for
Ifiiard mounting, and at any hour after
Â»hat could l>e found chatting with cadet
friends at the visitors' tent, strolling arm
in arm alÂ«nut the shaded walks with some
of their .many admirers until time to dreÂ«s
for the evening hop. where they never
missed a <]ar.cÂ«. and on rainy day's, or on
thoso evenings when there was neither
hop nor band practice, they could be
found, each in some dimly lighted se
clyjled nook about the north or west
Pâ¢ -' or on the steps leading down to
llio "Chain lialtery 'Walk." -times
surrounded by a squad of cadet friends
but more lently In murmured tcte
ti-tete with only or.c cavalier.
In the cn.-e <;f Mrs. Frank no member of
the corns reemed especially favored he
was just the same to erery one. i' n the
case of her younger listerâ Miss Tr-rrlssâ
tlic.-e presently developed a dashing
young cadet captain who so scienulic.iUy
conducted his campaign that, be heaueu
off almost all competitors and was

universally accepted theory that he hnd

were acknowledged on every side, and
entertained not only collectively, but
severally, for she always managed to give

was kn.-wn to have been engaged to five
fllfffirent men at different times, and be

tins by ..no of her chums she was reported
to have replied- "l>., you know. I believe
1' is true; 1 had totally forgotten about
Nod Colston before Air. Fonnan had been
at the post a week Of course the omy

and that she would dance night after

a look for him who leaned in gloomy ad
miration against the wall and never took

moody, ugly-tempered, and finally had the
good luck to net his conge -is the â¢
attempt to assert himself and limit
her dances. Bbc wn; blithe and radiant

because of the failure of a
half-hearted suit of his in the
Far Bast, and the fairy bounded into the
darkness of his life and fairly dazzled
him. Somebody had said Fran* Garrison
ha.l money.
There is no need to tell of the disillu
sion that gradually came. Frank found
his debts mounting; up and his caros in
creaainK- She was all sympathy and re
gret when he mentioned it. butâ there
were certain comforts, luxuries and things
she had always been accustomed to. and
couldn't live without. Surely no would

and when they came floating down the

and there could bo no -Imibtlng the elder s

In the salinity of tho sisterly retreat on
the third Boor of tho old hotel there oc
curred sometimes spirited verbal tilts that
were quite distinctly audible to passers
by In the corridor, provided they cared
to listen, which some of them did.
On this especial Aui;iwt evening Mrs.
Frank was in an admonitory frame of
mind. They had known Mr. Latrpbe
barely three weeks, and yet a^ Mrs.
Frank was sauntering around :i turn in

the cadet adjutant, there in the pathway
right ahead â  1 Nlta, a lovely little pic

"Songs and Sonnets," by Juliette Estelle
Mathls, Is a work of a different order.
Not one page Is without a definitely con

an Intensity of feeling which < xalts It *o
the love! of gpnu!ne poetry. The melody
<â¢ sweet, simple, unconstrained and even
at times effectively daring. The words
are always appropriate, at times singu
larly true
The poem entitled "Afar" Is Interesting
from Its deflniteness and sincerity of
"local color." Its scenery is genuinely
Callfornlan and n^tnlng else. Of all the
lyrics the one that pleased me most Is
"I thank thee. (iod."
In nearly all the poems a lack of mas
tery over style Is plain. "Serrate steeps"
Is harsh. For a "mandate" to "remand"
Is awkward In Bound and at the samÂ«
time affected In diction. Such defects
and some greater ones, notably lapses in
syntax, blemish many of the verses; yet
after all the poems are beautiful. The
songs especially are true lyrics, calling
for it music to make them complete.
The sonnets aro often stiff i.nd rigid,
the form being too severe for the author,
though even some of them < are fine
poem?. None of the poems reach great
ness. They have high eloquence, but not
quite the white Dame of the inspired

eyed and untrammeled purity In a
town where the gambling den and
the dancehall are unconcealed.
The Western freedom from re
strictions of convention or propri
ety has much evil In It; but the
freedom of girlish purity Is per
haps worth the price.
The novel is intended for a par
ticular purpose, announced In
clear but rather affected phrase
by the author in a dedicatory
note: "Forasmuch as It hath
seemed good in the eyes of many
to write of those things which
make for the disheartening of all
humankind, these things are writ
ten In the hope that the God-gift
of loving kindness, shared alike
by ialnt and sinner, may In some
poor measure be given It! due."
The novel then Is an Illustration
of the power of loving kindness to
make bad good In en Imperfect
world. The heroine. Constance
Elliott, has an unbounded meas
ure of that loving kindness which
is divine, bearing all things,
hoping all things, achieving all
things. The gambler, upheld by
her few words of faith In him.
finds after cruel failures the
power to leave his vice. The
harlot Is upheld and strengthened
In repentance by her love. Bless
ings and hap; Iness follow her
rteps because she Is possessed by
â¢that power of loving, Itself a
miracle, which works miracles.
The other characters have all
some touch of the same spirit In
them. the most fully presented
. being her lover, who begins v
gambler, but defying. Indeed cx
:lting. the hardest suspicions of
the world, even of those he loves
bast, performs nets of Incredible
kindness and forgiveness. The
purpose of the book is certainly
worthy of attainment, but if the
author wishes to prove what love
can do ho forgets that not fiction but facts
constitute evidence. The testimony of a
work of fiction -to the reaction of men's
minds on their experiences Is accepted
only m far as i a reader's Imagination
cordially accompanies the author's, find
ing the actions of his characters credible
The belief that Christ-like love, charity,
faith, forgiveness, will habitually bring
to repentance sinners on whom It Is ex
ercised rests on other grounds than its
success on a novelâ and most people,
would feel that Jcffard, who is saved and
built up to manhood, Is a bit mechanical
As a whole the book shows marked In
equality. Its conceptions are lofty it
contains flashes of true^vlslon - and pan
sages of adequate expression, but In a
great part of t! c work the .-.uthor's ideas
seem too much for him and the machinery
of the novel proves too cumbersome for
hii strength. The cover Is exceptionally
hideous. (Housrh'.on. Mimin & Co.. Bos
ton.)
"Fisherman's Luck." by Henry Van
Dyke, like The Chronicle* of Aunt

Magazine. It Is a collection of essay*.
lighter than froth, thistledown, a floating
feather, on anglingâ or rather on the con
templative s. .lability of fishing: on "talk
ability." that Is the qualities of nature
and disposition which invite the easy in
terchange of thoughts and feelings, on
a wild strawberry, on the open fire.
Kindly goodfellowshlp. n graceful, rather
diffuse stylo, a delight In tho open air
and In spacious Â«c:nery. mako this book

bound and Illustrated. (C. Scrlbner's
Sons. New V- Price 12.)
"For Love's Sweet Fake" is .-. book that
comes In a neat white box. which Is bound
in fine white cloth that look* M If It were
painted, and which la decorated with deli
cately outlined gilt Cupids, true-love
bows nnd hearts pierced with arrows llko
a valentine.
It is printed on thick and glossy paper,
and looks In all like a white satin bridal
dress.
It is a compilation of love porms made
by G. Hembert Wesley and Is divided Into
four partsâ Love's Horning. Love's Noon,
Love's Evening and I^ove's Night. Love's
Morning consists mainly of the Ingenious)
conceits about roses, Cupid, and love
whipped with feathers, which have madÂ«
so great a part of the stock of amatory
poets slur- three hundred before Christ.
In the rest of the book the poems have
a ring of naturalness and a quality of
concreteness rare In such collection*.
There is unusual dcfinlteness In such situ
ations that of the lover scorned by a
young coquette who has never known
love. lie prays:
"God pity you If you should meet wltlt
scorn
When love shall corns. 1 *
There Is a like distinctness and reality
In the wife's appeal for some token of thÂ«
love which she Knows she possesses:
"You cannot know, when we two sit alone*
And tranquil thoughts within you*
mind are stirred.
Mv heart is crying like a tired child
For one fond look, one gentle, loving
word,"
And In the desolation of the woman wad
had loved one who had no love to give:
"Why did he bend his eyes on me at times
Reluctantly, yet lovingly withal?
Take both my hands and calmly speak
Wise v.-or.ls of counsel that were M
much gall?
Who had no love to give "
Lovers married or unmarried will pretty
certainly find at least one or two poems
In the book which will speak directly to
them.
Although the collection contains so
many genuine and simple pages, and soroa
fine poetry, there Is In It very little or no
high poetry, like some of the sonnets of.
Mrs. Brownln.T or Michael Ante- or
Shakespeare. The poems are marked by
every day sentiment, not by the higher
tragic ideal. The pictures are Intensely
commonplace nnd really injure the book.
(Lee ft Shepard, Boston: SI 50.)
"A Modern Mercenary." by K. and Hes
keth Pilchard Â»E. and 11. Heron), is a
story in the style of Anthony Hope: it ha*
its little nation, its three diplomats and
its adventurous Englishman. But. llkÂ»Â»
most Imitations. It is not so good ns that
which it seeks to Imitate. The name of
the cour.try. Maarau, gives the reader a
feeling of petulance every tlmo he meets
with It* and the country Itself li too
vaguely pictured to convey an impression
of its reality. The characters are better
delineated. The hero openly claims for
his motto, "All things come to him who
waits." and ho simply waits while events
turn up to help him along. Perhaps the
best part of the book Is the last, where
the hero Is forced to choose between pri
vate and public honor, but we feel that
this would be Improved by condensation.

Queer Tricks of the Brain in

Efforts of a rather well-known â¢den

that somnambulism Is a modified hyp

But In opposition to nil arguments
cases have been adduced where- the
si' walkers were able to give after
waking fairly accurate accounts of their
experiences and sensations. So this. It
Is contended, shows conclusively that
somnambulism and hypnotism are two en
tirely distinct conditions.
The discussion reminds the writer of
an experience which an Edinburgh
lawyer, a confirmed somnambulist, went

pects the laws to be enforced and they are
not enforced. The police laugh at our

The existence of a "hotel nymphia"' is
an evidence of thÂ» unsolvable character
of certain problems which engage the at
tention of all moral communities. Evil
1Â« a part of human nature and It Is a
question always whether restrictive leg
islation can wholly suppress it. Many
of our social institutions are restrictive
to their character, tending to educate so
ciety to a belief or a conviction that the
indulgence of nature Is unbecoming our
higher Ideas of civilization and an of
fense to the Ideals which govern the ma
jority of the community.
But personal vieÂ«, the Indulgence of
the Bash, la fact every characteristic that
recails man b pagan nature and his alien
ation from the standards of a civil,
moral society, Is conditioned by the re
sponsibilities which the community se
lects to assume. Legislation can control
vice, legislation has the right to deter
mine that It shall be neither a sore In
the eyÂ«s nor a atlnk In the nostrils of
polite society. Legislation has thÂ«
right to say that vice, If it be abso
lutely Impossible to uproot It. shall j>
hldo Its face and be not seen of y
hose who are offended by its v
sight. That is not hypocrisy,
It In precaution. If I admit my
Inability to uproot certain
phases of vice I have at thÂ«
same time a constitutional
right to prevent my children
from seeing it.
Viceâ that Is. specifically,
the business of the bawd
and the beer bottleâ have
recently Increased In Ban
Francisco. It was un
avoidable. If San Fran
cisco pride Is stimulated
by its position as the
gateway to the Orient
it mast be prepared to
stand the consequeaoes
of an Influx of population,
military and civilian, that v
for the time being looks
with Imllfterenceat thestald
morality of our people. ThÂ»
".Vvniplila" os a business
enterprise is the result of the
Influx of a transient population.
It suggests something of the TinA".
!em of the relation of war to public mor
ality. ,
Rev. E. A. Woods, D.D. \
Pastor First Baptist Church.
The aortal evil has long existed and still exists In
all large cities. It has not bean and perhaps can
not be fully eradicated. The asm* !â  true of
many other evils. Bat laws afatnjst these evils
have been enacted and should be executed as
far and as fully as possible.
To localize and attempt to oontrol the social 1
evil Is In a senno to legalize that which Is Im
moral and Illegal. Laws attempting this have
been enacted In some American cities, but
they have failed to control all but the ruore j
open and shameless characters, and did not
reach the root of the evil. It followed that '
the outraged moral sense of the commun- Â«
lty demanded and secured their repeal. >\\
Such legislation Is Itself a degeneration /
and belongs to darker centuries and an un- /â¢
Christian age. An attempt to localize and 'i
protect crime Is Itself criminal. Such leg- V
Islatlon would encourage evil by encouraging
and maintaining a public example of It In our
own city under unction of law. The very
fact that such sins are Illegal and that their
practice *xpoÂ«es to arrest and punishment Is
a great restraint, espclally upon those who
lire beginners In such evil ways.
That such sins result In disease Is a loud
warning to those who are tempted to commit
them. God has declared that 'the way of
the transgressor la hard." and it is not for
man to m;;k,Â» it easy by legal enactments. It is
law of our nature that be "who sows to the
Mesh â hall of ill.- tlesh reap corruption." and to
attempt to reverse this law is both Irreverent
and foolish. Our laws against such evils are
Imperfect and Inadequate, but every arrest
and punishment i:ii<ierthes.^ laws stamps such
practices as disgraceful and criminal and Is a
safeguard of virtue.
There Is need of hotter and more rigid laws
for the protection of the purity of society,
but until these can be secured the press'
and the pulpit of our city should unite In
a demand for the execution of such protec
tive laws as we hÂ«ive.
Samuel sJocombe.
Pastor Fourth Coogrega

In recent rears the so-called
social evil has come to bo re
garded as â .Â« of the local
problems tliat the presa
of San Francisco no
longer fear to dis
cuss. This la at
It should be
provided the
whole mat
tor can be
fully and
flspa*Â«lonatÂ«ly dealt with as oocaslon
requires. Society suffered much and
longâ suffered in Its very fiber and
lifeâ in obedience to the mistaken sen
timent that this question could not
property be handled by the daily press.
But in the closing of Morton street
and other pestilent quarters Infested by
the scarlet woman the press has taken
ft vigorous acd honorable part ta axprei*
THE SUNDAY CATjIj.
Ing and at the seme time quickening Into
action a long Buffering public sentiment.
The work of the press In this connection,
however. Is by no means complete. The
scarlet woman of San Francisco Is not
to be disposed of by the clo?inK of a Â£-
of her haunts in a given part of the.
city. Of course, what public sen
timent has done It can do
again; but the trouble
with public sentiment
it that when it
has Indulged
in a rush of
â  **â -*.â ;â¢â 
enthusiasm or a spasm of Indigna
tion It Is quite api to "rest and be
thankful for a long while. Later It
may wakÂ« up from a protracted
â lumber to find thai the results of 111
previous virtuous efforts have been un
done by the Reaction of a vigilant enemy.
The pre.-< m is a time when the best
moral sentiment of the community needs
to be kept awake and on the watch. Il
lusive articles and plausible paragraphs
.In certain society papers are Just -now
circulating the rankest and most perilous
heresies upon this question.
It Is eald. for example, that such is the
severity of our code of social ethics af
fecting the relations of the sexes that
the scarlet woman could not reform if
she would. "Her whole life is forfeit
by the unwritten law of society as the
dire penalty of her fall." It Is broadly
Intimated that she is not only a victim
of social conditions but a necessary evil,
and that even if she could be exiled her
place would soon be filled by other vic
tims of human passion and weakness. All
this and much more of the same kind
(Interlarded With such exclamations as
"Alas, for the rarity of Christian char
ity') is made to pave the way to the ulti
mate suggestion that fallen women shall
be confined to a given area of the city
nd there kept under municipal guardian
ship and police supervision.
The mischief lurking behind all this
Is twofold. In the first place, the plausi
ble Ideas referred to profess to emanate
from a lofty sentiment of compassion lor
follow women, combined with a virtuous
regard for the public well being; and in
the second place. It is assumed not only
that the evil under discussion cannot be
eradicated, but that, therefore, in direct
violation of statutory law. it should be
permitted, sanctioned, protected.
Pome of the fallacious assumptions re
ferred to may be sufficiently met In terms
of polntblank denial. It Is not true, for
example, that there Is no avenue of re
treat by which way-ward girls and women
may return to lives of rirtue end honor If
they to desire. The history err what is
tinned refuge work in large oiUes affords
ample proof of this. There is abundant
wcauth In this city for any tuch work,
and abundant disposition to urn
it wisely and worthily. Baa
FranciFoo could raise a
refupa fund of ample
proportions In a very short space of time.
Neither la it true thru there is anything
peculiar or uncontrollable in the condi
tions of life in San PrandÃOO tending to
force ->ur youth Into vicious, way*. Girls
virtuously disposed do nut need to sacrifice
their virtue for bread, and there is probably
no large .ltv in all the broad urea of thl=Â»
great nation In which it is easier for a
thrifty younc man t-> marry and maintain
a wife in comfort than In San Francisco.
It Is â  libel upon our fair city to affirm or
Imply that ai:y of our boys or girls are
forced into vicious ways by the hard con
ditions of existence here. vt.ious train
ing and environment deliberately fraught
with temptation l>y vicious persons are
th.' todal conditions to which our young
people are victims, and for these the* body
politic Is largely responsible.
An essential truth to be recognized In
this connection is that what Is termed
the social evil is peculiarly sensitive to
encouragement or discouragement It
shrinks before oppressive agencies or
grows rank upon Indulgence. Considered
In the light of this truth, our laws bearing
upon this matter are essentially Bound in
principle and npirlt. In that they frankly
treat this evil as a crime against the
public well beingâ a crime to be dis
couraged, punished, suppressed. Ik>w.
soulless men. Impelled by motives of
greed, plan dens of vice and give them
gaudy names In order to ensnare the
young, to whom they promise Indulgence
in vice with Immunity from Its natural
consequences. But the promise Is an eter
nal delusion. The shaded aid* of human
history, everywhere and always. Is one
long, tragic Illustration of me "wages of
sin" in this regard. From the deep re
cesses of Africa Dr. Livingstone sent
forth his plaintive wall about "the open
sore of the world." and the silent lesson
of modern France, with her debauched
sense of Justice, her decadent energy and
her dwindling population, tells of the same
thing The laxity and indulgence of the
French people are gradually but very
surely sapping the power of France and
Inevitably destroying her historic status
as one of the leading nations of Burope.

. . !. W^lJees,
'v Chief of Police of San Francisco.
\1 It is neither my duty nor my province to suggest legl*
v lation to met I the exigencies presented by the social evil.
I as it obtains In San Francisco. My office Is to execute the
1 laws, not to create them; and In this discussion I can only
\ refer to what has been done and consider the obvious
Â» sequences flowing from the operations of the Police Depart*
iment. It has been necessary upon the complaints of own
ers of property adlacent to premises occupied by prostitute,
to remove them In a number of instances from the localities
which they have inhabited, and when they have sought t<Â«
sottle elsewhere I have by timely notice Intercepted their so
dÂ«Mng. The Hotel N'ymphla matter is an aside from this. In
that case it was not until the prenil?es became actually oc
cupied in the purposes which the law forbids that It be
t;me subject to interference by the police. While the build
ing was in process of construction, although I hail ample
-usftlcions of Its intended use. yet It was riot amenable to
interdiction. If It had never become so usfd the build
frg itself would have been In no sense a violation of the
aw. As soon, however, as It became applied to the pur
poses for v/hlch It was designed I anerted the Interpo
sition of the police arm of the government, and tha
rase thereupon commenced hn* not yet beÂ»n settled.
These women, being stirred from their abodes, are
sort of In the air, like particles of dust. No M as
sorts or pretends that their character* or pursuits
have been changed simply by being forbidden to
conduct their business upon a particular site.
The discussion which has been Inaugurated by
The Call goes deeper than a meeting of the
social evil problem through nailing up thÂ«
doors of the dens. If It were po^ble â¢â > nail
. up very den door In the city, to acquire
knowledge of the 'existence of such places
instantly upon their starting up. to Iden
tify every woman engaged In the occupa
tion, however, covertly, and drive her
from her web Immediately It were
spread, would prostitution be less In
San Francisco or would It be greater?
Would the contamination to public
morals resulting therefrom be slight
er or more pronounced? If they are
driven from thÂ«Â» alleys, do they not
take to the streets? And so long as
there exists a disposition between
the sexes to conduct this vile traf
fic, so long as there are men with
minds and money and women
with minds who want money,
can It be expected that the'
mere denial to them of site*
or particular thoroughfares
will defeat their vicious en
terprise? It has never don
so in the history of human
ity. Prostitution iÂ» not a
mct'er to be blotted out by
the stroke of pen of him who
rigns an inhibit ordi
nance! It Is a problem of
social an.i political econo
my; It Is a product of the
general arrangement of
things. Grant It Is unnat
ural, violative of the free
I Instincts and dispositions
of mankind, abhorrent to
those who have not be
come perverted, can It be
changed by a municipal
regulation?
It haÂ« become the wisdom
of experience that the most
â  possible of being done with
prostitution Is to control It.
Government can control it.
and thereby curb It. hut It â 
nowhere pretended that this
ran be done under laws which
Scflne It as a crime to be abated.

that -he Is Interfering. Admiral Dewey
Is paid to be very fond of music and his
wife's musical accomplishments will cer
tainly prove a great pleasure to him.
"Mrs. Hazen drense* very quietly. Ele
gant simplicity Is the keynote of her
street costumes. She U now wearing
blnck In memory of her son John, who
waÂ» killed last year by belnK thrown from
his horse. Mrs. Hazen talk.* in the rjulck,
enthusiastic manner of a French woman
and her clothes have that indefinable m
that suggests Paris. She has a most
graceful bearing and carries her five feet
and an Inch or M with a queenly grace.
I saw her once In a bis h chiffon ball
gown with a diamond necklace around
her throat, which la as soft and pretty
a* a young girl
"Mrs. Hazen. while her maid was fas
tening the necklace, aald thai shÂ« <Il.Â«ltke.l
a display of Jewels. She would not per
mit the maid to put a tiara In her hair.
Mrs. Hazen wears her copper-tinted hair
In a soft knot at the top of her head
escaping ringlets curling over her fore
head. Her face Is lovelier now than It
could possibly have been before It was
sorrow chastened. 1 shall never forget
her as she looked that night
Miss Htone praises Mrs. Dewey not
more warmly than every one else who
knows her.
'When "Ned" McLean. Mr, HazÂ«n*s
young nephew, heard of the enirncement.
he remarked with boyish frankness. "I
tell you. Dewey's In great luck!"
Relations in law are proverbially criti
cal of each other, but Mrs. Hasert Â«i slster
ln-law, Mrs. John R. McLean, says of Ad
miral Dewey's choice of a wife:
"Mrs. H t'.en Is a woman fa'thfu! and
good in every domestic lelatton. As a
daughter and mother she Is aa nearly per
fect as is permitted to mortals. She has
always be.-n a great b-Ile In society,
though her personal dignity kept her from
entering Into some of the m .>re frivolous
phases of Washington life.
