CRUISER CHARLESTON
LIES IMPALED ON AN
UNCHARTED REEF
From Manila Comes Word That There
Is No Chance of Saving the Ves
sel-Washington Officials
Yet Have Hope.
MANILA. Nov. 14.â Further details 1
regarding the grounding of the i
United States cruiser Charleston j
show that she struck an un- j
charted coral reef ten miles east J
of Kaniguin Island. Her stern was nl- j
most submerged and the bow almost out j
of water. A heavy sea was on and the
cruiser began rolling violently. The [
â¢watertight doors were quickly closed, but I
were stove in under the engine compart- j
ment. the largest of the ship. After the j
first efforts to right her the officers feared ;
she might slide off because of the heavy
sea, and they abandoned the attempt to j
save her. Thoy hurried to the launches
arid boats and rowed away, prepared to
fight for a landing with two Colt guns, 134
rifles and ten days' rations.
Some of the officers and men were
dressed only in pajamas and their under- I
clothing. The breech blocks of the can
non were removed before the boats put
oft. Two hours after the Charleston
struck all had got away. The report that
the crew remained two days on the vessel j
Is Inaccurate. A party returned two days
later but found it impossible to save any- j
thing.
The first landing was made on a little
Island, with a front of barren rocks.
Next day the boats again took to the
water and proceeded to Kamiguin Island,
where a landing was made In the expec
tation that firing would be necessary. So j
â far from this being the case, however, the
! Charleston's men found a half-savage j
people, who regarded them with curiosity |
rather than hostility. On the third day j
the storm had greatly subsided, and Lieu
tenant John D. McDonald, with Boat
swain Dominick Glynn and six men,
started for the Gulf of Lingayen In a
thirty-foot sailing launch, hoping to find
an American warship, but entirely ignor
ant of General Wheaton's expedition.
Lieutenant McDonald was four- days
afloat, keeping under shelter of the hos
tile shore on account of the high seaÂ«,
being most of the time In falling rain.
Finally, flying the Union Jack 'Town, clad !
In their underclothing and drenched to th"
skin. the officer anil his companions over
took the transport '-./.-â â  . which carried
them to the battle-ship Oregon.
The cunboat Helena was due to arrive
at Kamiguin Island yesterday. Tho j
Charleston was returning from a iivr
weeks' cruise alone: the western coast of j
Luzon, and Admiral Watson was begin- i
ning to be uneasy. He supposed, how- j
ever. that nhe had joined General j
"tYhrnton's expedition.
In naval circles the accident is consid- \
. ered <iuite unavoidable. The only wonder !
is thnt there are not more such disasters j
in Philippine waters, which remains in- I
differently charted.
The Charleston lies practically in the j
open sea and there is no hope .if saving
her or the valuable paraphernalia and
contents of the cruiser.

HER LIFE DREAM
REALIZED AT LAST
Mrs. Jane Stanford Sells Her Vast Railroad In
terests and Receives Eleven Million Four
Hundred Thousand Dollars for Immediate Use.
She Will Now Endow the Leland Stanford Jr. University With
the Fabulous Sum Thus Acquired and Complete the
Splendid Purpose of Her Late Husband and Herself.
MRS. STANFORD NOW READY TO COMPLETE HER LIFEWORK.
NEW YORK, Nov. 14. â An event of national importance in financial, railroad and ed
ucational affairs took place to-day in this city. The splendid dream of the late Leland Stanford
and Mrs. lane Stanford has been magnificently realized. Mrs. Stanford sold to-day every dollar
of her enormous holdings in the Southern Pacific Company, and with $11400.000 received from
the sale will complete the almost fabulous endowment of the Leland Stanford Jr. University. In
this transaction the life ambition of Mrs. Stanford is won and the hope of her late husband is ful
filled. The Stanford University is now one of the richest institutions of learning in the world.
In the financial transaction, which is only the medium through which a great purpose has
been realized. Mrs. Stanford has disposed of all her stock in the Southern Pacific Company to
the Huntington-Speyer syndicate. Her holdings amounted to 285.000 shares of stock, for which
she received approximately S4O a share, or $11,400,000. There is no doubt that the stock was
bought in the interest of C. P. Huntington. Mrs. Stanford lias thus made available for the insti
tution which has made her famous throughout the civilized world a fortune the size of which almost
baffles the imagination.
The sale "f Mrs. Stanford's stock in the
Southern Pacific moans that Stanford
University will be Immediately onrlched
by available money. The pri^e obtained
for the stock signifies that tho estimates
of the original endowment will be in
creased by several millions and may place
Stanford at the head of the list of richly
endowed universities of the world.
This sum of eleven million dollars may

bo so wisely arid safely Invested that the
1 permanent income will contribute so much
annually to the Institution that all future
â  danger of financial embarrassment- will be
removed.
Mrs. Stanford, whose noble mission in
' life is to execute the plans which she and
) her husband devised, has surely good rea
j son to rejoice in the great fortune which
j has followed the exercise of her judg
ment in handling the vast interests en
trusted to her care.
Dr. Jordan and his associates may go to
work with renewed zeal and vigor to build
up such an institution as Leland Stanford
had in mind when he resolved to dedicate
his vast fortune to tho cause of education.
j There will be no more scaling of salaries
! and personal sacrtfiees by the faculty to
: keep the university in touch with other
1 great institutions of learning.
Some time ago Mrs. Stanford disposed
of her Central Pacific stock, which repre
sented her late husband's interest in the
original corporation.
All the railroad property that Mrs.
Stanford now owns, in common with C.
P. Huntington, is her interest in the Pa
cific Improvement Company. This cor
poration was originally known as the
Western Development Company, but the
scandals and mischief arising from its pe
culiar management caused it to be known
| to the public of California as the West
ern Devilment Company. Thereafter the
name was changed to the Contract and
Finance Company. Subsequently the
name Pacific Improvement Company was
adopted. Railroad men now speak of the
interior corporation as the "P. I." Com
pany. Mrs. Stanford's interest in this
concern may not exceed $1,000,000.
In financial circles of New York some
mystery clings to the long sustained ac
tivity in Southern Pacific stock. The
price obtained by the Crockers for the
Southern Pacific stock which they owned
was a surprise to the bankers, but the I
high figure was accounted for on thej
theory that C. P TTuntinsrton was willing
to pay :i top-notch figure in order to gain
absolute control of the situation..
It is possible that agencies other than
those directed by Collla P. Hunttngton
secured Mrs. Stanford's 286,000 shares of
Southern Pacific, but The Call's informa
tion is to the effect that the deal was
wrought in the furtherance of Hunting
ton's scheme for a transcontinental Una
to be operated under bis immediate man
agem-nt.
Recently C p. Huntington ordered that
grading of the Santa Barbara extension
should provide for a double track. In
the rugged country, where the work of
grading is in progress, the additional
grading and cutting for a double track
adds enormously to the cost of preparing
the roadbed.
( '. P. Huntington is reported to have
said that his new road along the coast
from San Francisco to Los Angeles would
be the best in the world, and when that
enterprise was finished he would keep
right along the lines of improvement until
he owned a road across the entire conti
nent that would be acknowledged as the
best road in the United States.
Dr. David Starr Jordan, president of
Stanford University, will receive the in
telligence from New York with profound
satisfaction. The estimate of value which
Leland Stanford placed upon the railroad
property has been verified by the prices
which Mrs. Stanford obtained for Central
and Southern Pacilic stock.
Whatever may be said about the merits
and motives of the men connected with
tho great railway corporation of the Pa
cific Coast, it must be acknowledged that
Collis P. Huntington's able and sagacious
admimlstration of the road has been the
prime factor in maintaining the value of
the property.

MAJOR JOHN A. LOGAN
AMONG THE AMERICANS
SLAIN BY FILIPINOS
Fierce Battle of the Thirty-Third Regi
ment With Insurgents Near San
Jacinto â Many of Agui
naldo's Men Meet Death.
MANILA, Nov. 14.â The severest !
punishment since the fight at |
Zapote River, near Imus, was !
inflicted on the insurgents Sat- j
urday morning through the
brilliant work of the Thirty-third Volun
teer Infantry, und<Â»r command of Colonel
Hare. Several hundred men in this regi- j
mem were recruited in Texas, and some I
of them were formerly in the Rough
Riders. After the fight, which took place
near San Jacinto, the bodies of eighty-one
dead insurgents were found on the field, j
Twenty-nine prisoners, forty-seven Maus
en and fifty-six Remingtons were cap
tured. Seven Americans, including Major
John A. Logan, were killed and fifteen
wounded.
An advance guard of eight Texan |
sharpshooters under the personal di- â 
rectlon of Major John A. Logan, en
countered a fusillade from insurgents?
well concealed in a trench beyond a wide
bog. As the remainder of Major Logan's
battalion of the Thirty-third struggled
forward to support him. the enemy's
sharpshooters, who were concealed in the :
tops of cocoanut trees and in trenches .
along the roadside, opened a murderous
fire. A Gatling gun was used with good â 
effect as the rebels ran away.
The insurgents' sharpshooters continued
firing at a point where the first light
started until an hour after the town was j
taken. Their shots were directed upon a j
field hospital. Major Logan was shot
through the head and mortally wounded
early in the tight while stooping to at- :
tend a corporal who had been wounded.
A hospital steward was killed while try
ing to drag Logan's body to the side of
the road. Shortly afterward at the same j
spot a captain and a non-commissioned |
officer were wounded. All this was the
work of sharpshooters, who picked out
the officers by their uniforms. Half a'
dozen of these men were spotted In
and killed by our sharpshooters. The fir
ing on the field hospital men did not
cease, however, until a detail returning
from San Jadnto to convoy the dead and
wounded to San Fabian chare,! the i
try of insurgents and found Logan among |
the dead.

death had already been under discussion.
YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio, Nov. 14.â A pri
vate disoatch received from Manila this
morning announced the death of Major
John A. Logan of this city. The remains
will be brought home on the transport
Sikh. Mrs. Logan, widow of Major Lo
gan, is completely prostrated over the
death of her husband and her physicians
will not allow her to be seen. She had
expected to spend the winter with her
children in the south of France and was
preparing to leave when the cablegram
announcing Major Logan's death was re
ceived.

Mrs. Logan has received the following
telegram from President McKinley:
It is my painful duty to convey to you the sad
intelligence of the deattTbrs*iKir husband- while
gallantly leading his battalion In the charge
at San Jacinto. His splendid qualities as a sol
dier and high courage on the fighting line have
given him place among the heroic men of the
war. and it will be some consolation to you to
know that he died for his country on the Reid
of honor. You have in this trying hour for
yourself and the children the sincere sympathy
of Mrs. McKinley and myself.

OPERATIONS OF
THE STEEL TRUST
Manager Gates Tells of
Its Workings.
ONE SCHEME THAT FAILED
ATTEMPT TO FORM A WORLD-
WIDE COMBINE.
Admits That the Price of Barbed
Wire Was Raised Because His
Company Had a Monopoly
of Patents.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.â 1n giving his
I testimony before the Industrial Commis
i sion lu-day John W. Gates, managing di
rector of the American Steel and Wire
Company, gave an interesting account of
- to form a consolidation of th*
ts of all the wire-producing countries,
::!.g the American nation. He says
h<- visited Great Britain, France, Ger
many, Belgium and Austria for this pur
pose. Germany he found to be the prin
ompotitor, England's work in that
respect not being sufficient to deserve se
rious consideration.
In Germany he found the manufacturing
rs compete most seriously with tho
United States, and bounties and subsidies
were given on every hand to hold up the
manufacturing interests of that country.
The German manufacturers lirst proposed
that ;ii case of an international consolida
tion the United States should bo content
with 2o per cent of the product. This he
had declined and they had Increased the
allowance to 55 per cent. He had run
away from Berlin to avoid accepting tins
allowance. Ho had himself represented
the possibility of increasing prices to the
extent of about $lv a ton in case of the
proposed amalgamation, but found that
the Germans had in view an increase of
about $20 a ton.
In this connection Mr. Gates com
mended in high terms the German method
of encouraging the producing and ex
porting interests, saying that if the
United States Government would adopt
the plan there pursued it soon would be
doing 90 yer cent of the iron and steel
business of the world. He advocated sub
sidles to steamship liries and to national
corporations of $5,u00,00i) capitalization aiui
over. Ho would have the corporations
pay liberally for such charters In the be
ginning and then have them pay largo
sums annually for the continuance of the
increasing the amount as the
capitalization increased until the annual
fee Bhould be no less than $1,000,000 for a
any capitalized at 1100,000,000, He ad
ted Government supervision of all
such corporations. He said the protective
tariff had much to do with building up tho â 
iron and steel industry, and that the con- I
Lnce of the policy was necessary to ,
the future prosperity of the industry.
Mr. Gates said that consolidation had j
been effected last January. A number of j
plants that could not be operated had
ueen shut down. The company employed j
men and wages had ueen increased !
:. average of 40 per cent. The coin- :
pany did not, he said, recognize the trades ]
IS, dealing with its men a 6 Individ- i
nals, and it would not recognize the
unions as such. He said the company
controlled all the barbed wire patents and
had a mopopoly In. this respect. On this t
product a higher charge was made than ,
her products because of the monop- j
oly ot the patents. This was because of ,
the money spent in their acquisition. Gen
speaking, tho advance in wire prod- j
ucts had been only proportionate to the J
ase of the price of raw material. Ho
considered that all these advances had
been due to demand and supply and not ,
to the combination. Indeed, he asserted
that the American company did not seek
a monopoly of the production of unpat
ented articles, nor seek to control the *ell
i:;g pric* of its patrons. On the contrary,
the disposition was to encourage other or
ganizations. It was not true, as people
seemed to believe, that the trusts con- i
trolled the Iron and steel business of the I
country. As a matter of fact, they con
trolled only about 40 per cent.
Mr. Gates deprecated the present high
prices of iron and steel products princt- !
pally because of the high prices of raw ,
material. He, however, expressed the j
opinion that the present price would con- I
Unuo for the next two or throe years,
pi dieting the opinion on his knowledge
of the demands of railroads, the ship- l
yards and the building trades. He said
it. it his company was exporting no 1.-ss
than 7'."K> tons of wire a day, supplying
England, for instance, with 60 per cent oj j
the wire products purchased there. Ho i
admitted that the goods were sold at \
â  rates abroad than at home, but for
the present this waa necessary to hold
the outside trade. He had found that In
Germany all lines of the iron and steel
Industry were syndicated. He had pro
cured copies of the agreements, but ho
declined to produce them, laughingly Bay-
Ing that he had them stolen. He said the
can company had earned a divi
dend on its common stock as well as on
Its preferred, the directors considering It
wiser to lay aside something for a posst
dny day.
Other witnesses of the day were Max
Ham, counsel for the American Steel and
Wire Company: J. C. Pierson, organizer
of the National Spear Company, and J.
Wiess, vice president of the last named
: company.

NOTORIOUS GANG OF
SWINDLERS CAUGHT
At Their Head Is Alonzo J. Whlte=
man, Once Convicted of Forgery
in San Francisco.
NEW YORK, Nov. 14.â There Is at po
t lice headquarters here a quartet of pris
â¢ oners In whom the police of almost every
I large American city and many of the
( leading business houses, banks and trust
companies have a deep interest. They
were rounded up after having been
watched for several months and were
formally held by a police magistrate to
day on the nominal charge of being sus
picious persons. The police of New York
say that most of them have been con
victed here and elsewhere of swindling
that has netted them many thousands of
dollars. The prisoners are:
Alonzo J. Whlteman, i' 3 years old. of
Dansville, N. V., the alleged head of the
gang. He is a graduate of Columbia Law
School.
Frank Edmunds, 40 years of age, a
clerk of New York.
John Thompson, alias William Hartley,
alias P. Lawton, "alias Dr. George W.
Johnson, 31 years of age; clerk; residence
unknown.
Robert J. Knox, 42 years o^d, lawyer, of
'm w York.
adhere is under arrest at Plttsburg a
nfth member of the gang, Charles D.
Stewart, alias Charles Ward, about 60 or
.v years of age. He was arrested there
yesterday.
According to the statement given out
to-night by Captain McCluskey, chief of
detectives, members of this gang hava re
cently obtained several thousands of dol
lars through the manipulation of bogus
drafts and other evidences of credit.
Several months ago a man claiming to
be \\ . L. Howe, cashier of the National
l.ank of Lawrence. N. V., ordered IO.cOO
drafts of a certain design from a firm
of lithographers in this city and paid
for them in cash. They were sent to
m 1 "i n care of Mrs - Whiteman, Dans
\ille, N. 1." a few days later a North
x.iver boat deckhand found one of the
pooka of drafts in tne river and the book
was sent to a detective bureau. Soon
reports of bogus drafts began to pour in
from all over the country. The drafts
were all made on these forms and drawn
on tho National Bank of Lawrence N
V.. Investigation by the police traced
them back to Whlteman, who lived with
his mother in Dansville. N. Y. There
it Is alleged, he formulated the plans and
his tools all over the country carried them
out.
Their general plan was to enter Into
alleged business transactions, some
times for the purchase of real estate
and, after depositing bogus drafts for
large amounts with banks or with the
business man with whom they sought to
deal, to draw upon the alleged credits
before the bogus nature of the drafts
could be ascertained.
DEPUTIES SCORE
FRENCH MINISTRY
Pardoning of Drefyus
Denounced.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Nov. 14.â There was a large at
tendance at the opening of the Chambor
of Deputies to-day, which was extremely
animated. The President (M. Deschanel)
read numerous requests for permission to
interpellate the Government. The Pre
i mier, Waldeck-Rousseau, asked that all
] Interpellations respecting the Qovern
â  inent's general pulley be discussed to
gether. This Idea was accepted and M.
j Donys Cochin (rightist) opened the de
j bate by reproaching the Government for
j opening the doors of power to the social
ists by giving M. Mlllerand (Minister of
Commerce) a portfolio.
M. Grandmaison, another rightist mem
ber, blamed M. de Gallifet, the Minister
i of War, for not supporting the Govern
ment in ita efforts to repress the machi
natlona of the military and clerical par
ti- '^, and demanding the separation of
church and stale.
M. Lasies, anti-Somite, condemned the
measures taken against various officers,
a.lcling that the latter had good reason to
say it was shameful. Amid Government
protests M. Deschanel called M. Lasies to
order, but the latter persisted, declaring
â  that with such a Government disobedience
was a duty. The statement called forth
renewed protests. The Chamber then
adopted a motion, censuring M. Lasits,
and General de Gallifet ascended the trl
bunal and protested vigorously at the re
marks M. Lasies bad made concerning the
army, saying the Deputy had no right to
speak as he had done. The Minister's
statement caused loud applause from the
left.
< '..ritimiing, the general said he re
prrotted none r<t his declarations or acts.
and then, amid constant rightist and
anti-Semite Interruptions, he proceeded
to justify the measures which he said he
had been compelled to take regarding
certain officers. Hi- asserted that General
Rogct talked too much; General Negrier
i hau declared in the presentee of his of
ficers that the Government had permitted
attack on the army, but that when tho
army ha"d enough of them there were men
ready to take up itÃ defense. Here the
' rightists shouted "Vive Negrier!"
General de Gallifet continued, saying he
did his duty in punishing General Negrier,
at which the rights and anti-Semites
' noisily protested.
Paul de Casslgnac (rightist), who fol
lowed, said the pardon of Dreyfus was a
slap in the face for the army and re
proached the Government for not defend-
I ing the army, which, he claimed, had
been so calumniated and insulted.
M. Vivian! said on behalf of the social
ists that they were ready to uphold the
' Government, whose projects they accept
ed as a minimum. The House adjourned
until Thursday.
The Senate after a formal meeting to
! tfay adjourned Pine die in order to con
tinue the trial of the conspiracy cases.
DEADLY DUEL WITH
RIFLE AND REVOLVER
GALLUP, X. M.. Nov. 14.â A Mexican
courier arriving at 9 o'clock this evening j
brought news that L. E. Denemore and
J. A. Maxwell, both prominent citizens of j
Gallup, had fought a duel at sundown
this evening, one with a Winchester, the j
other with a six-shooter, about fifteen
miles northwest of here on the Little ;
Water road, in which Maxwell was killod
and Densmore mortally wounded. The j
two men left Gallup about 11 o'clock this j
morning in company with the Mexican, !
who brought in the news, both In good
humor and on friendly terms. The cause
of the trouble is not known.
The only witness to the affray is the j
Mexican, who says he was directly be
tween the two men when the shooting
began and has blood on his overalls from
having kneeled beside Densmore, who
asked him to carry tho news to his wife.
He covered the wounded man with a ;
blanket and left for town immediately,
leaving no one with the dead and wound- j
ed men.
Mr. Hnrper, Judge Maxwell, a brother!
of the dr>ceaÂ«d, and two or three others j
have left for the scene of the duel.

In the Grammar School rooms here to-day j
The scheme was worked In this city,
Brooklyn, Woonsocket, R. L, and Pitts
burg. Among the bogus drafts was one
drawn upon the Lawrence National Bank
of Lawrence, Kansas.
Whlteman, who came from Dansville
to this city on Saturday last, was ar
rested at the Hotel St. Marie, on Fifth
avenue, where he had registered as "C.
W. Caldwell, Philadelphia." He had been
sending invitations to himself by tele
phone and telegraph to occupy a box at
the horse show and to dine at various
prominent clubs.
Chief of Detectives McCluskey says
Whiteman is wanted in Chicago, and the
police records in this city show that he
had swindled several hotels in this city,
Chicago, Boston and Atlantic City.
Thompson is accused of being a hotel
swindler. Edmunds' picture is in the
rogues' gallery, and he has served terms
in both the Elmlra Reformatory and Sing
Sing.
Charles E. Stewart served a term of five
years in Sing Sing for forgery about 1878,
and later eighteen months for obtaining
money under false pretenses. In 1889 he
stabbed a woman In Cincinnati and served
four years for it In the Columbus peni
tentiary. He served a term in Rochester
for robbery, and, last of all, three years
and three months in Sing Sing for the
theft of thousands of dollars' worth of
bonds and other papers from the Wal
dorf-Astoria, the property of John C.
Calhoun.
Alonzo Whiteman has been arrested a
score of times. He has traveled the world
over. He inherited $500,000 from his father
In ISSS. after leaving college. He led his
class in the Columbia law school, and
after getting his diploma and before be
ing admitted to the bar he went to Du
luth. He made a great deal of money
there during boom times. He lost his for
tune in the Chicago Board of Trade
within a year. He then turned to the
racetrack. He made money as a book
maker, met a streak of bad luck,
"welched" and was ruled off the track
for passing bad checks. He was sen

charges.
CHICAGO, Nov. 14.â State's Attorney

Whiteman was under arrest In New York.
An officer Is to be sent after Whiteman,

BRAIN FOOD
Is of Little Benefit Unless It Is
Digested.
Nearly every one will admit that as a
nation we eat too much meat and too lit-
tle of vegetables and the grains.
For business men, office men and clerks,
and. In fact, every one engaged in sed-
entary or Indoor occupations, grains,
milk and vegetables are much more
healthful.
Only men engaged in a severe outdoor
manual labor can live on a heavy meat
diet and continue in health.
As a general rule, meat once a day is
sufficient for all classes of men, women
and children, and grains, fruit and vege-
tables should constitute the bulk of food
eaten.
But many of the most nutritious foods
are difficult of digestion, and it is of no
use to advise brain workers to eat largely
of grains and vegetables where the diges-
tion is too weak to assimilate them prop-
erly.
It is always best to get the beet results
from our food that some simple and
harmless digestive should be taken after
meals to assist the relaxed digestive or-
gans, and several years' experience have
proven Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets to be a
very safe, pleasant and effective digestive
and a remedy which may be taken dally
with the best results.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can hardly
be called a patent medicine, as they do
not act on the bowels nor any particular
organ, but only on the food eaten. They
supply what weak stomachs lack, pepsin
diastase, and by stimulating the gastric
glands increase the natural secretion of
hydrochloric acid.
People who make a daily practice of
taking one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after each meal are sure to have
perfect digestion, which means perfect
health.
There Is no danger of forming an in-
jurious habit, as the tablets contain ab-
solutely nothing but natural digestives-
cocaine, morphine and similar drugs have
no place in a stomach medicine, ami Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets are certainly the
best known and most popular of all atom
ach remedies.
Ask your druggist for a 50-cent packa^
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, and after
a week's use note the improvement in
health, appetite and nervous energy. ,'

CONTESTS IN SEVEN
KENTUCKY COUNTIES
Result to Determine Which Party
Shall Have Plurality on the
Face of Returns.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 14.â The prog
ress of the contests In various counties
of the State Is the point about which In
terest In the fight for the Governorship
is centered. The determination of these
disputes may swing in either direction the
result of the face of the returns as they
will be made to the State Board of Elec
tion Commissioners. These contests in
volve 4000 votes in seven counties, as fol
lows:
Christian County, 95 votes, Taylor's plu- â 
rality in one precinct at Hopklnsville, I
which was to-day thrown out by the j
county election officers.
Johnson County, where the 878 plurality
for Taylor is being disputed by the Demo
crats on the ground of alleged irregu
larity.
Knox County, 1355 plurality for Taylor
in contest. Under a mandatory order of
Judge Brown at Barbourville these re
turns have been certified by the county
election officers, but the contest undoubt- i
edly will be renewed before the State j
Board.
Mercer County, 256 plurality for Taylor.
The Democratic chairman of the Election
Board has filed notice of contest in three
large Republican precincts, alleging va- j
rious irregularities. If these precincts
should be thrown out Goebel will have a
safe plurality in the county.
Nelson County, 1198 votes are being con
tested by the Democrats on the ground
that they were certified for W. P. Taylor
instead of W. S. Taylor. The Republicans
to-day Tiled suit at Bardstown against the
County Election Commissioners, and the
election officers in the thirteen precincts
involved are seeking to "obtain a manda
tory injunction to compel the election of
ficers to certify these llyS votes for W. S. !
Taylor. The matter will also come be- !
fore the State Board.
In Pulaski County 300 votes are con
tested. Taylor's plurality was 1546, in
cluding the 300 which came from five pre
cincts where contests have been insti
tuted.
In Harrison County 135 votes are In con
test.
An amusing feature of the situation
developed to-day when It became known
that more than 3000 votes In Fayette
County had been cast for "J. C. XV. Bick
ham," Instead of Beckham for Lieuten
ant Governor. In Nelson County, Beck
ham's home, by a "clerical" error of the
Democratic clerk, General Taylor's name
was printed on the ballot as W. P. Taylor
instead of W. S. Taylor. When to-day
Beckham's friends discovered what had
happened in Fayette they served notice on
the Goebel people that no contest must
be made of the Nelson County vote, and
as a result Taylor will not lose 1100 votes
cast for him there, and all of the votes
cast for "Rickham" in Fayette County
will be counted for Beckham.
ADJUSTING DIFFERENTIALS
ON WHEAT AND CORN
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.â The Inter
state Commerce Commission to-day an
nounced its decision in the case of the
| Board of Railroad Commissioners of the
! State of Kansas against the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company
and other carriers. The main points de
cided by the commission are as follows-
The changes which have taken place in
conditions governing the transportation
of wheat and flour from Kansas point, to
destinations in Texas are not sufficient to
warrant interference in this case with the
differential, making the rate 6 cents
higher on flour than on wheat, which was
approved by the commission In the KaufT
man Milling Company vs. Missouri Pacino
Railway Company.
Carriers of corn and commeal from
Kansas points to destinations in Texas
enforce a differential of 7 cents per 100
pounds more on cornmeal than on corn
and Buch difference prohibits the ship
ment of cornmeal ground at Kansas
points Into Texas territory.
It Is held that the difference in rate of
7 cents against cornmeal and in favor of
corn unjustly discriminates against Kan
sas millers and that the differ
ential should not exceed 3 cents per
100 pounds. Several different carriers en
gaged in transporting wheat and corn
from points in Kansas and Missouri and
Intermediate points to Galveston and New
Orleans make lower export rates on
those commodities! from Kansas City, Mo.,
or points in that vicinity, than from some
of the Intermediate stations on their re
spective lines. It is held that the higher
rates from such intermediate points sub
ject those localities to undue prejudice,
and that if the carriers are allowed to
make these low export rates they should
in making them treat all intermediate
territory alike and doslst henceforth from
charging higher rates from the nearer
stations than those from the more dis
tant points.

ST. LOUIS JOBBERS
Witnesses Admit That They Are
Simply Fighting to Get More
Coast Business.
ST. LOI ! 14.â At the resumption of the hearing before the Tnter
â  tsion this morning ex-Governor Fifer of Illinois, re
â  â  d W. .T. Calhoun, resigned, appeared and took the
: S thing occurred to-day to disturb the representatives from
st. Examinations of the tariffs on local shipments westward
\i w York*, Chicago. SC Louis and other Eastern and middle West jobbing

â¢ quickly became apparent, namely, that It lsÂ» a

nplainant to-day, who Bald that their clients were after
â  tilers of the coast, and th< railroads must be the means to

: shown in Its tru- light when a Chicago jobber, under

ST. LOUIS, Nov. 14.â The Interstate ,
Commission resumed its session this j
morning. Fifer, the new Commissioner,
sat with the commission, making a full
hoard. Ex-Commissioner Calhoun con
ducted the rxamination of -witnesses for
the complainant.
A telegram from the Merchants' and j
Manufacturers' Association of Stockton, |
signed by President Henderson and pro- i
testing against the relief asked for by the !
: merchants of St. Lbutsj was presented to i
the commission and filed in the case.
Traffic Manager Van . - ndingham
showed his want of knowledge of the sit
uation by claiming that there -was no
water competition as to most of the arti- I
cles covered by the complaint, as the clip
per ships had disappeared. He seemed
greatly surprised when told that eleven
dipper ships from Eastern ports were
due in San Francisco during October, and j
that the manifest of one of these ships i
covered nearly all the articles which he j
t [aimed were no longer carried by water.
It also came out during his cross-exam
ination that this proeieding before the
commission was taken by order of the ;
board of six managers or the St. Louis
Traffic Bureau; live of whom were jobbers j
in this city. He was asked to name the
manufacturers of St. Louis who had con
sented to the complaint, and could men
tion only one small concern.
Van -Landingham finally admitted that j
it was "a right of the jobbers to get more j
business on the Pacific Coast; 'â¢ the â¢
manufacturers were not taking a hand in ;
it; as they sold largely to the Pacific
< :iast merchants, and naturally would not
like to. do anything to offend them.
The next witness called for the com
plainant was one Allen, the traffic man
ager of the Meyer Bros.' Drug Company,
tine -of the largest wholesale houses in
drug's and chemicals In the whole West. ;
it seems that each of the biggest Western â 
jobbing house." has a man known as j
traffic manager, whose sole business is to
liÂ«.ik after shipments, rind over what
lines merchandise may be shipped to the ;
best advantage and obtain any rate off
which the railroads will give. The comp
laint of this witness was that Ms house j
could not sell to retailers on he Pacific
Coast 0:1 such favorable terms as the ;
jobbers there, because it could not ship !
small lots to advantage. He admitted j
that the jobbers of the Middle West '
usually got a freight allowance from the â¢
manufacturer? on goods shipped t<> St.
Louis and similar places, which in many
instances gave them a lower rate to Pa
cif.c terminals for large quantities than
"those shipping from New York and other
Atlantic ports.
He was followed by F. W. Hurly, sec
retary of the hardware hmise of â¢ Lrwell. ;
O?mdn, Kirk & Co. of St. Paul, who .
said that his company was still doing a ;
i-irge business with . . â  Hers in Oregon \
;\nd Washington; but wanted the rule as |
to' mixed lots moditied so they could not '
cVily ship on more favorable terms In less
than carload lots, but pack various arti
cles, such as rosin, shoe blacking, toilet |
paper, twine, razors, pocket knives and ;
the like, in one box at lower rates, so they |
could go more directly to the retailers and j
jr^t ns much profit as the Pacific Coast I
jobber, who gets his goods In larger quan- \
titles and 13 satisfied with the present \
programmes. He said distinctly that the ;
present rateÂ« wrre fair to the shippers so i
i'ar as their earnings were concerned, but
wanted a change in the rates to facilitate
the Middle West jobber In getting his
merchandise to the Pacific Coast In small
lots.
The star witness of the day was B. B.
Putton. freight manager for the â in of
Kelly. Maus A- Co. . dealers in heavy
hardware, at Chicago. He frequently !
safrl. that this w:iÂ« a fight between the |
Chicago and Pacific Coast jobbers for the j
"Western trade: that the Pacific Const I
man nnwlmd the advantage as he bought
his merchandise In carloads and so s-ot
better rat'-s. H>Â» made a good deal of fun

For some time the police have been

any other shipments, with the result
mentioned.
When taken to police headquarters
Thompson made a clean breast of the
whole affair. He said he had the con-,

STOCKTON, Nov. I.4â W. J. Golds
worthy, a prominent politician and pro
prtetor i if i he American cash store, a
large grocery, is in jail here and the Dis
trict Attorney has charged him with
burglary, hxing ball at $5000. C. C.
Anderson, a colored porter in the
employ of Adkins & Co.. wholesale liquor
dealers, had occasion ty go to the store
last evening about 8 o'clock. Hearing a
noise in the basement, he entered and
struck a light, and there found Golds
worthy In tne act of rleelng. He had re
movea with a jackscrew tne supports of
the floor utider the barrels of alcoholic
liquor and substituted boxes, which he
had saturated with coal oil, after which
he had piled other boxes ami straw
around, and paper, straw and boxes led
to the outside of the building through a
hole in the basement. on discovering
Goldsworthy Anderson grasped the iron
of the lackscrew and told Goldsworthy he
would brain him if he tried to get away,
to which the man replied, "You have got
me."
Goldswortby's grocery store adjoins the
liquor house, an. I his plan was evidently
to cause the destruction of both buildings,
so as to avert suspicion. His Stock was
Insured for 110,000. Anderson procured a
â ah and drove Goldsworthy to the resi
dence of Hugh Adkins, proprietor of the
liquor store, where Goldsworthy requested
that Irving Martin, publisher of the Dally
Record, be sent tor. Martin is his
brother-in-law, and he also brought Mrs.
Goldsworthy with him. Goldsworthy made
a piteous appeal to Adkins and Anderson,
tor mercy and begged them on his knees
and with tears In nis eyes not to inform
upon him. Both men were obdurate, how
ever, and District Attorney Ashley was
sent for by telephone about ?, o'clock in
the morning, when Goldsworthy was
turned over to the officers and placed in
jail.
He ha? engaged an attorney to defend
him. and to-day refused to be Interviewed.
Goldsworthy had always been regarded
here as a law-abiding citizen and was
one of the leading members of the Mer
chants' and Manufacturers' Association,
besides being a member of several fra
ternal orders. His agÂ»Â»d mother and his
wife are nearly prostrated with grief ami
shame, and the affair has created quite
ation here.
The offlfers who have investigated the
case declare thnt the plans of Golds
worthy were mÂ«>s? complete, and that the
tire would not only have destroyed the
entire block but endangered the lives of
i the people who were occupying rooms on
; the upper floor. The falling of the spirit
uous liquors would have made a fire with

MOLINEAUX'S TRIAL
FOR MURDER BEGINS
Prosecution Will Attempt to Prove
That the General's Son Sent Poi
son Through the Mails.
NEW YORK. Nov. 14.â Roland B. Mol
ineatix was put on trial fur hi? life to
day in rh.' t'.nirr of General Sessions be
fore Recorder Goff, chargM with the
death of Mrs. Kathertn J. Adams on De
cember 2?,. 1898. Mrs. Aflams died after
swallowing what was believed to be a
headache powder that had been Bent to
her through the mail in a silver match
holder as a Christmas present to iiar
;â¢. Cornish, physical director of the
Knickerbocker Athletic Club, nn<l by him
administered to Mrs. Adams, with whom
he resided. A â â¢hernioal analysis devel
oped the fact that the powder contained
a deadly combination <>f cyanide of mer
cury. The Investigation which f"! : wed
resulted In developing that Henry (J. Bar
mother prominent member of the
Knickerbocker Athletic Club, who had
recently died, had received a similar pow
der and that it contained cyanide of mer
cury also.
Roland H. Mollneux was among the
witnesses put on the stand at the Coro
ner's Inquiry, where the testimony went
to show that Molieux bore enmity
toward both Cornish and Barnet. He was
ted after considerable delay, and
has be.-n in the Tombs ever Btnce. Three
Grand Juries considered his case, and the
third brought in the present indictment
-t him. Both sides have fought
bitterly ever since Molineux'a arrest, and
to-day, after several hours were occupied
In an attempt to select a Jury, not one
man had been found suitable to occupy
a chair In the jurybox.
When the case was called this morning
Barlow s. Weeks, counsel for Molineux,
made a final and desperate effort to have
it transferred to the Supreme Court, but
The Recorder ordered the trial to pro
ceed.
Mr. Weeks also made a lengthy argu
ment on a motion to dismiss the indiÂ«-t
--ment, but Recorder Coff several tin.es
told him that his talk was trivial and that
he was wasting words.
Molineux'a father, (Jeneral Molineux,

ry Cornish was present, and the court
room was crowded with people. The pris
oner displayed the samÂ» air of confidence
that has marked every public appearance
of him since hifl arrest, and after ad
journment he was permitted to remain
in the courtroom for some time, where he
talked pleasantly with his counsel and
the court attendants. The case will be.

Colonel Baden-Powell under a flag Of

the Geneva convention authorized the
flag of the Red Cross Society to fly
from several buildings at once in the

ment of natives against whites and the
use of dynamite mines were both opposed
to the rules of war.
Colonel Baden-Powell replied that the
Geneva convention did not stipulate as to ,
the number of Red Cross stations permis
sible and that the Boers were only re
quired to respect the convent the hos
pital and the women's laager, all of which
were beyond tne town limits. The British
commander aiso pointed out that mines
were recognized adjuncts of civilized war
fare, and the defenses of Pretoria were
extensively mines. Moreover, lie re
minded General Cronje that the Boers had

posed Boer spy. is released by Sir George
White. The Premiers deliverance meets
with universal approval, although the
explanation was in no way necessary, as,

ALLEGED DEMAND AND

LONDON, Nov. 14.â Nothing [a known
either at the War Office or the Colonial
Office here regarding the alleged official
statement cabled imm Cap* Town say
ing State Secretary Reitz, In behalf of the
Transvaal Government, has demanded
thai General White Immediately release
Nathan Marks, a suppose* spy, who la
confined at Ladysmith, the dispatch
â¢uldlng that President Kruger threatens
if Marks Is executed to retaliate by
Bhooting <; ix British officers In thÂ»- batids
of the Boers. It is further asserted from
Cape Town that Marks went to Lady
smith after the Investment of that piace
with the supposed object of obtaining in
formation for the Boers, and one version
of the story is that the Transvaal au
thorities have threatened to execute nix
British officers if the supposed spy is not
released 10 which General Buller is said
to have replied thai the British were en
titled to retain the man until he should
render a satisfactory account of lilm.sHf.
Both Btories it is asserted, bear the mi
urint of improbability, as then- is no reason
to think that the Boers would be guilty
Â«,f such a complete change from their pre
vious correct attitude and mariner of con- 1
ducting the hostilities. Nevertheless, the
sensational afternoon newspapers here
are alrea ly demanding that President
KniKer and all the members of the execu
tive council be ruthlessly handled as the
only tlttlns reprisal in the event of State
Secretary Reftz's threat being carried
out.

The shells are of a very Inferior quality

ADMIRAL SCHLEY'S MISSION.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.â Rear Admiral
Schley, who is about to assume command
of the South Atlantic squadron, called at
the Navy Department to-day and had a
long conference with Actfng Secretary Al- j
len concerning the genera! character of i
the trip on which he is about to embark.
It was the admiral's final call before
leaving, as he goes on Thursday to New
York, where on next Saturday he will fly
his tlag on the cruiser Chicago. The sail
ing of the ship, giving her route and des
tination, have not yet been issued, and it
is said a definite determination has not
been reached on this point.
The admiral's visit led to renewed con
jectures as to the probability of his going j
to some of the South African ports. As j
to this, however, the admiral declined to
sa> a word, and there was the same reti
cence throughout naval circles, it ir, un
del-stood, however, that the Government's
general line of policy as to the South
African war will be made known to Ad- i
miral Schley before lie sails, as there- j
after he will be the executive officer in
closest touch with that field.

LAYOUT FOR
THE TALENT
Five Choices at Tanforan
Were Humbledâ Yule Left
at the Post.
Of all the frightfully bad days the tal
ent has experienced this season, the six
short Innings played with the bookies at
Tanforan Park yesterday were the most
expensive. After the victory of Sardine,
the L'orrigan filly, which enjoyed a cake
walk as usual, the momenta following
were thoso of anguish for speculators.
Five straight favorites were knocked off
thfir pins, and the books reaped an un
heard ot harvest. i 'aldwell, the "Prince
of American start* left Yule, thfe
heavily backed favorite, for the second
event, burning up a carload of coin, and
Torlbio, another plunged on choice, was
turned half sideways when the webbing
was released.
The. win of Judge Wofford caused about
as much consternation as any during the
afternoon. With 9S pounds up and 40 to 1
in the betting, he won the third event
In a gallop from Lena, another outsider.
Corrigan's O. B. Morris finished a groggy
third, two lengths before Schiller. The
latter opened at 3 to 2 and closed 11 to 5.
The opening scramble was only a romp
for Sardine. She was a stake mare thrown
In -with a bunch of platers. Druidesa ran
second, two lengths ahead of Kickumbob.
After Caldwell had left Yule, the
plunged-on favorite, at the post, the sec
ond event, at live rind a half furlongs,
proved easy for Earl Islington, ridden by
â Burns. Monda took the place from Lo
thian.
. Again In the third number Caldwe-ll let
the : inch away with Torlbio, backed
from fours to 3 to 8, not headed to the
barrier. As a result Coda downed the out
sider, Flamaway, with ease. Ricardo ran
third. 1- ;
Lodestar, at odds of 10 to 1, captured
th* live and a half furlong spin, fifth on
thei programme, also ridden by Burns.
Mocorito and Rio t.'hico raced their heads
off out in fr.mt, and Hums landed his
mount a comfortable winner two lengths
in front of the favorite, Mocorito. J.
Walsh rode the second choice. Potente.
about as well as a Chinese laundryman,
finally getting the show.
My Gypsy was favorite for the closing
mile run, and was nosed out by Zoroaster,
a 3 to 1 chance, piloted by J. Martin.
Meadowthorpe also ran.

Cable Companies Asked to Make Re

The growing commerce between this
country and the Asiatic cities is greatly
hampered by the cxc- s-r. ph and
cable tariff charged and the merchants
of both sides of the water have deter
mined to secure a reduction if possible.
The matter was brought forcibly to tin
attention of the members of the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday by a com
munication from the Hongkong General
Chamber of Commerce which asks the co
itlon of the local body to Induce the
rraph and cable companies to reduce
their rates.

the rates are excessive and opi

a twenty-five-round bout at 124 pounds
from Jack Hamilton of Troy. X. V., to
night at the Broadway Athletic Club.
The victor was not "the Gardiner of a

more forcible and had the greater weight
behind his blow. Gardiner was the clean

from : : :.- start it was palpable that he
was suffering, from the old complaint of
weak hands. Both wrists- went back on
him from the .very beginning and at the

CALIFORNIAN WHO HELPED
TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP
JAMES HUGHES, THE CRACK PITCHER, TO PERFORM HERE.
FOLLOWERS of the national game In this city will be pleased to learn
that James Hughes, the Sacramento boy who so materially aided the
Brooklyn Club to carry off the championship for 1599, will pitch for
the All-Californlan aggregation in their game with the Sacramento
team on Thanksgiving day. Hughes has shown wonderful Improve
ment In his chosen position during his two seasons with the National League,
and the "fans" who have been watching the Californian's career In the East
will derive much pleasure in prelnp him pitted acainst the team on which he
first came into prominence. Umpire "Jim" McDonald has chosen him to fill
the "points" in the Initial game, and he has acted wisely, as Hughes will prove
a big drawing card.
James Hughes was born in Sacramento on January 23, 1574, and learned
the rudiments of the game in that city. In 1596 he signed with the Victoria
i !'â¢. C.) Club of the Pacific Northwestern League, which disbanded early in
the season. Hughes then gave very little promise of developing into a Na
tional League star. He next joined the Gilt Edges, and his speed and control
of the sphere soon brought him. into prominence as a "twirler." When the
Baltimore Club, champions of 1597, visited this coast they played the Gilt
Edges at the capital. Hughes" pitching was so effective that the champions
were 6hut out, much to the surprise of everybody. Upon the recommendation
of Hughey Jennings, the famous shortstop, he was signed by the Baltimore
Club and made his debut In IS9S. In his first game he disposed of the Wash
ington Club, allowing; one hit off his delivery and but one run was scored.
In April, 1898, he shut out the Bostons without a hit or run, and later held
tha champions of the season to one run and two hits, all of which stamped
him as being a pitcher of high order. Brooklyn cast covetous eyes on the
California!) and managed to secure him at a high price. During the season
that just closed he made a splendid showing. A writer In Sporting Life said
of him: "As a consistent performer Hughes of the Brooklyns tops all the
league pitchers, having won twenty- six out of the thirty-two league games
he officiated In the season of 1599. There are eight pitchers who had a per
centage of 1000, but only one of them pitched in more than two games, so that
Hughes must be credited as the real leader of the league pitchers." Hughes'
record was twenty-six games won out of thirty-two.
IS THE HISTORIAN OF
HER WARRIOR'S GLORY
MRS. GENERAL GEORGE E. PICK
ETT HERE ON A VISIT.
An Authoress of Note Who Is the
Widow of One Soldier and the
Mother of Another.
Mrs. General George E. Pickett, widow
of the famous Confederate commander
â¢who led the desperate charge at Gettys
burg, is a guest at the Palace, where she
arrived yesterday from Washington, D. C.
Her trip across the continent is taken
with the solo purpose of seeing and say
ing good-by to her son, Major George E.
Pickett of the United States pay depart
ment, who leaves on Thursday for the
Philippines.
Of General Pickett nothing can ba said
that is not already history. A born sol
di.-r and lighter of the old romantic chlv
alrlc sort, he made his name famous al
most as soon as he donned the shoulder
straps of a lieutenant after his gradua
tion from West Point. For several years
he was stationed on this coast. It was
he whn planted the stars and stripes on
the tower of the City of Mexico and it
was he who defied the whole British fleet
at San Juan Island, Puget Sound, when
England was trying to grab the territory
which now belongs to vi.
Of General Plckett's military career in
the ranks of the Confederacy too much
cannot be said. As a leader of men he
bad no peer, and had it been possible for
one man to win victory' fÂ° r tn Â« cause
which was lost it was such a man as the
one who pushed his lines right up to the
flaming crater of Little Round Top that
the South would have worshiped as its
greatest hero.
Since the death of her husband Mrs.
Pickett has devoted herself to literature
with the result that she is to-day one of
the recognized writers of the latter part
of the century.
Her latest work. "Pickett and His Men,"
a story of her husband and his military
career, has Just come from the publish
ers. It Is a volume bound In Confederate
gray, full of stirring incidents, many of
which were personally witnessed by the
authoress, told with a fire and in a style
that carries the reader along despite him-
Belf and makes him imagine that he
lives, for the time being, among the fa
mous personages and great events that
are recounted.
Mrs. Pickett has a book In press which
treats of the first case of hypnotism on I
record in this country. It Is dealt with
in the form of a romance, with its chief
scenes in Washington, New York and
New Orleans. It is cleverly written, well
constructed and full of excellent situa
tions and clever dialogue.
Following the appearance of this book
Mrs. Pickett promises to give to the read
ing public a volume of short sketches,
which she says will treat of the negro,
his legends and superstitions in a manner
as new as it Is correct to the character
of the colored race. Most of the stories
that it will contain are taken fr.om tales
told Mrs. Pickett by her old Virginia col
ored "mammy," who was wont to take
this way of amusing her young white mis
treps.
Mrs. Pickett will probably leave the lat
ter part of the week for her home in
Washington, D. C.
BERNARD WARD CONVICTED.
Found Guilty of Embezzlement on
the First Ballot Cast.
Bernard Ward, walking delegate of the
Pacific Coast Marine Firemen's Union,
was convicted by a jury In Judge Dunne's
court yesterday morning of having em
bezzled $4uoo from the organization
named. The verdict, which was reached
on the first ballot, came as a surprise, as
a disagreement or acquittal waa expected.
It is claimed by the d< fendant's attorneys
that the prosecution failed even to estab
lish the corpus delicti, and that when the
case goes before the Supreme Court the
Judgment will be reversed. Patrick
Rogers has already been convicted of hav
ing embezzled the union fund?, and John
Dougherty is awaiting trial on a similar
charge.
At the Steeplechase.
There was a large attendance at the
Steeplechase, Central Park, last evening.
The new attractions were of a high order
and met with favor in the eyes of the
large audience. The Jeffrtes-Fitzsimmons
light is a faithful reproduction of the
great battle fought some months ago
Captain Beach, the water king, lived up to
his title, and Professor Hill did some mar
velous balancing on the high wire. The
Jolly Razzle-dazzle and the many novel
ties of famous Coney Island were in full
blast. The horses were liberally patron
izea and there were some exciting rides
on the wooden steeds fur prizes The
steeplechase furnishes a good evening's
.â¢ntertalnment, and should be crowded the
rest of the w^k.
GRAND PRODUCTION OF
"THE MASKED BALL"
Those who omitted to attend the per
formance of "The Masked Ball" at the
Tlvoli last evening missed a musical treat
the like of which has seldom been wit
nessed in this city. Taking on one side
the extremely melodious music which
Verdi composed for this work and on the
other the excellent talent which consti
tuted the cast, it is most assuredly a pity
that such efforts do not meet with that
appreciation which is by right their due.
In short it was a performance which was
easily worth two and three dollars Al
though Signorita Poletini had no oppor
tunity to show what she can do, the little
that came to her lot was executed with
that refinement of interpretation which
is so much admired in Salassa and Ave
dano. Salassa, owing to a transposition
of the orchestral score, became somewhat
confused in the third act, but he soon
picked up his thread and sang that mag
nificent romanza in a manner that will
long linger in the memory of those who
were fortunate enough to hear it. Ada
Palmer Walker made her first great hit,
receiving not less than four encores.
ALFRED METZGER.

ROOT THE
CHOICE OF
BETTING MEN
The Chicagoan Made a Pro
nounced Favcrite Over Greg
gains in Eoxing Bout.
The meeting of boxers "Jack" Root and
Alex Greggains. before the Western Ath
letic Club at Woodward's Pavilion to
night gives promise of being one of the
most stubbornly contested bouts seen in
this city in many months. Root comes
from Chicago with the prestige of an un
broken string of victories in the ring dur
ing the past two years. Greggains has
not seen much active service during that
period, but this does not mean that his
hands and eyes have lost their cunning in
the art of attack and defense.
Hr has had boxing gloves on every day
imparting the rudiments of the game to
athletes of every size and all degrees of
ability. Physically he is as sound to-day
as when he boxed Sharkey, Choynski.
Stelzner and others of the heavy-weight
division. His gameness has never been
questioned and as a defensive fighter he
should have a few equals owing to all hid
practice with the gloves.
Root brings with him from Chicago all
the latest ideas and fashions in the world
of fisticuffs. He has been a principal In
Important ring battles ami lias had oppor
tunities of st'i'inK the beat boxers in ac
tion. The visiting horsemen have a high
a of his ability, as the weight of
their money has made him a pronounced
favorite In the betting. This opened at
Harry Corbett's at 10 to 7 and quickly re
ceded until yesterday it was 2 to 1. It is
will be the prevailing fig
ures when the men enter the ring.
The preliminaries promise well. Fred
Ast and "Jack" Weedy and "Toby" Ir
wln and "Jack" Ennis are well matched
brar.-s of boxers. Ast is clever and a hard
hitter, while Weedy is a second Sharkey
in the way he accepts punishment that
would stop another man. Both have
trained as faithfully as the men in the
principal bout. Ast has spent his time
during the conditioning period with Greg
gains, at the Six-Mile House, while
W< edy has done his work with Root.
They have gono on daily Jaunts down the
Haywards road together and have
rouerhed it in their improvised gymna
sium. There, is no question as to the con
dition of any of the boxers who will meet
in the ring to-night.
The question as to a referee was one
on which it seemed impossible for the
men to agree. After a number had been
proposed by each man and rejected
promptly by the other, they decided that
"Big Bill" "Lange, the ball player, could
safely be trusted as arbiter. Mr. Lange
politely yet firmly declined the honors
thus thrust upon him. The combatants
met a^ain last night, and lost but little
time In agreeing upon Charles 11. Long.
He is manager of the Western Athletic
Club, which is promoting the bout, and Is
a veteran of the ring.

CITY GETS JUDGMENT
FOR VALUABLE LANDS
For want of prosecution, the action of
Eleanor Martin against the city and
county of San Francisco, in which the
plaintiff sought to prove an alleged title
to almost the entire block bounded by
O'Farrell, Geary, Scott and Pierce streets,
has been dismissed. This property in
cludes the Girls' High School and many
residences, and the plaintiff claimed that
the city was in unlawful possession. The
suit was filed in March of 1572. Regard
ing the motion to dismiss Judge Hunt
said:
"I have no doubt as to the power of the
nisi prius court in the premises. In th*
Jeffords case, a precedent cited, the de
lay was for a period of time less than five
years; here the delay is over twenty
years. I therefore reel constrained to
grant the motion, and the dismissal is
hereby ordered."

was during the Midwinter Fair, when the
first contest in <!ist;i â¢â 'â¢â¢: casting was won
by Flint of Sacramento with a cast of 81
feet. Mr. Mansfield's second cast thin
year is 133 feet, although he has exceeded
this in unauthenticated trials. Twenty
years ago the recorci was 70 feet, and then
102H feet was the mark for nine years
until Harry Golcher exceeded It. Mr.
Golcher has since run his record up to 126

JEWELRY HELD BY POLICE.
Suspicion That Murdered Woman's
Possessions Are Stolen Property.
The Coroner's deputies are holding the
jewelry which was found on the body of
Delia Tracy, the woman who was mur
dered in a Turk-street lodging-house last
week, at the request of the police. It
consists of several rings, a watch and
chain and various other ornaments. The
supposition is that a portion of it is
stolen property and the detectives desire
time in which to make an investigation
before relinquishing their hold on any
thing which might become a matter of
evidence.
A man named Wilson is desirous of ob
taining possession of the watch. He ex
hibits a bill of sale from one of the Dar
tles intimate with the woman. His re
quest for possession has been refused un
til the police end their researches De

One of the overdue fleet made port yes

owners of vessels now out an unusually
long time for Puget Sound ports. The
British ship County of Cardigan was 52
days out from Nagasaki for British Co
lumbia and 25 per cent was paid by the
underwriters to reinsure their risks. Yes
terday the ship arrived at Port Townsend,
and Captain Hughes reports having been
driven north by the southeast storms and

it has been wing hard along the coast
from the southeast, but yesterday it
chopped around to tie northwest. 11 this
change oÂ£ wind holds good as far north
a* Vancouver Island, then thÂ» overdue
lleet of coasters should be heard from
within the next forty-eight hours.
As against the long passages oeing made
by the Thompson. American Girl, Germa

the runs of the C. P. Sargent and Colum
bia stand out in bold relief. The Sargent
left here November 2 for Departure Bay
and made the run in four days. The Co
lumbia left here for Tacoma on November
5 and made the run In five days. Cap
tains Haskell and Nelson went up the
coast in steamboat time, but were careful
not to pass Cape Flattery until they had
a good slant to pass In through the
straits. _ . ,
The transports City of Sydney and
Pathan sailed for Manila yesterday after
noon With the Forty-sixth Regiment. The
men were all put aboard during the day,
and as soon as the orders were given the
transports dropped out into the stream.
The transports Ben Mohr and Senator will

Monday, November 20. and the Duke of
Fife arid Hancock Tuesday or Wednesday
of next week.
When the Ranger comes down from
Mare Island next week the old hands
along the front will wonder what new
warship Uncle Sam has added to his navy.
Not so very long ago ) he was known as
a sloop-of-war and was bark-rigged. Now
she Is a "fore and after" and will be
classed as a gunboat. A complete new
battery has been added to her outfit, and
she Is* now manned by the crew of the
Badger, that vessel having gone out or
commission. It was originally the inten
tion of the Government to send the
Hanger to the Philippines, but news from
the seat of war tend to show that the sit
uation Is now well in hand, so the Ranger
will remain on the coast.
Captain Rider haÂ« taken command of
the cruiser Philadelphia, vice Captain
White, who tires on full pay. Captain
Rider was lieutenant commander of the

captain of that vessel.
The tug Ida W had a hard Time of it
petting the schooner W. F. Wltzemann in
from tea last Monday. There was a very
heavy swell on and the bar was breaking
in places. A very heavy roller struck the
schooner and the steel hawser by which
she was being towed parted. A Manila
hawser followed suit, and for a time the
Fchooner : â ;:â¢ d gunwales under. Captain
James on the tug soon went to her assist
ance, however, and passing another haw
ser aboard â  wed her in safety into port.
There were a few critical moments for
both tug and schooner after the hawsers
parted, and both captains were glad to
see the fort opening up as they passed in.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus

Four members of Company K. Forty

food by some persons who are as yet un
known.
Thrse victims are convalescing and will
. be discharged from the hospital, but
j that their cases did not prove fnta! is
! due to the prompt medical treatmf-nt they
received. When first examined the
patients s-howed signs of a severe poison

collapse with pulse barely perceptible.
It was thought at first that their cases
would prove fatal, and it was only after

members of the company say that the
poisoning was the result of the hash

MARCONI SYSTEM
TO BE OPERATED
IN THE ISLANDS
Company Now Being
Organized.
Marconi's system of wireless telegraphy
Is to be placed in operation aa a means
of communication between the five prln
cipal islands of the Hawaiian group. F. 1
J. Cross, an electrical engineer of Hono- i
lulu, who has been stopping at the Occi
dental, has, after a very thorough inves
tigation of the practicability of the sys
tem, closed a contract with the Wireless :
Telegraph and t-:icrnai Company of Lon
don, the controller of the Marconi pat
ents, for the construction and installation
of a complete plant, to be operated be- :
tween the islands of Hawaii, Oahu. Molo
kai, Maui and Kauai. The contract call*
for the completion of the plant by Feb
ruary 1, 1900.
Mr. Cross has been investigating wire
less telegraphy for several years, and when <
he learned that the United States Gov
ernment was to test the Marconi system !
he went East and participated in the ex- 'â¢
periments conducted between the cruiser
New STork md the battleship Massachu
setts, being on board the former vessel.
These tests so thoroughly satisfied Mr.
Cr< >s that he at once opened negotiations
with Marconi, with the result stated.
"The Marconi system is a most unqual
ified success," said Mr. <'r>ss when seen
â¢ venir.g at the Occidental. "The .jx
periments between the Government vis-
Bla proved ' r ~ practicability beyond ques
tion. The instruments worked perfectly,
with the sending and receiving points
thirty-six mi!*-s apart. There is no limit
to th< in which me.-

thing that interferes is the curvature of

between any "f the islands where
we will operate is sixty-one miles, ai
order to secure a ci.'.ir passage f>>r th^
be sending and receiving
stations will have to I
â  t from the earth's surface."
While Mr Cross owns the Hawaiian
franchise for the Marconi system, it is his
intention to organize a sto''k company as
snort as he returns to the islands. In fact, â¢
before he left there to Invesl
proposition he was given assurance of
ample financial backing to operate
plant if In his judgment it was a sin
The Hawaiian company will be the rirst
to operate tho Marconi system as a pure
ly commercial enterprise.
Mr tes that Marconi is so
thoroughly satisfied with the success . â  f
his Invention and so confident of his
lty to demonstrate its grÂ«-at value that
after Studying the maps of the islands he
said without hesitation that Mr. Cross
might Insert any penalty he desir.-.i In the
contract In case that wir> : iphy
did not prove to be all that its Inventor
claimed for it. Mr. Cross will return to
â  â¢ lulu to-day on the Australia, and
will commence at once the preliminary
work of establishing telegraphic commu
nication between the islands.
AMERICAN TROOPS
PRAISED BY MILES
Report of the Command-
ing General.
Special Pispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 14.â The annual
report of Major General Nelson A. Miles,
commanding the army, was made public
at the War Department to-day. It bears
the date of October IT, 1899, and is ex
tremely brief and formal in character. It
announces the transmission to the Secre
tary of "War of the reports of the depart
ment and staff commanders, and makes
a brief statement of the strength and dis
tribution of the army, including the mus
ter-out of the regiments, most of which
details have already been published in
I the report of the adjutant general.
The report concludes with the follow
ing general statement:
The demand for troops for foreign service
has been unusual and has been somewhat
severe upon them, especially those of the regu
lar army. Within the last eighteen months
several repiments have been required to leave
their stations in the extreme North, move to
the islands of the "West Indies, there engace
in a campaign in summer, return to northern
stations in the autumn arid winter and move
again to tropical islands in the Pacific and
engage in campaign? un.ier the must difficult
circumstances. Rarely In a service have troops
â¢ sperleoced such unusual changes in cliniat- 1
as those above indicated, yet under all cir
cumstance* and at all times the utmost loy
alty, fortitude and faithful performance of duty
have been manifested on the part of thf I
In nearly all enKafr^mfius where thp
have been brought Into contact with the en-my
they have Invariably acted on the offensive
and not in a single Instance have they suf
fered defeat. The intelligence, discipline and
fidelity of both officers and men have been
most commendable.
Owing to the additional and extraordinary
expense placed upon officers while serving in
the Philippine Islands, Cuba. Porto rtteo and
the Hawaiian Islands it Is recommended that
they be allowed the same percentage â â¢: ihÂ»
Increase of pay that is now provided by law
for the enlisted men.
It is also recommended that officers of the
army with a creditable record, who served
during the Civil War. shall be gratv
same consideration concerning- rank anil pay
aR has been accorded officers of the navy by
section 11. act approved March 3.
As far as organization is concerned, the army
is in a transition state. It is believed that
the force will be ample for the service required
of It up to the time authorized, viz.: July I.
lfini. It is gratifying to note that the Govern
ment has authorized 8 military force which
seems commensurate with its requirements,
magnitude and Instructions. I have for years
recommended the adoption of a standard In
rtion to the population, viz.; not to ex
ceed one soldier to cvi â  the popula
tionâand I believe that the establishment of
such a standard would be safe and judicious In
every re?pect.
I uring the past few years rapid progress
has been made in the equipment of the Atlan
tic, Pacific and gulf consts with modern de
!, and If the general plan is carried out
it is hoped that In a !>hnrt time our coasts will
be In a proper condition of defense.
Some very important discoveries have been
made In relation to ordnance, projectiles and
high explosives, and after careful, thorough
and exhaustive tests appliances have V.-^r:
ted which will greatly increase the effi
ciency of our armament.

LINE OFFICERS
ARE COLORED
Arrival of the Fort
Thomas Regiment.
CROWD OF HAPPY FIGHTERS
THEY BOAST OF A BAND THAT
HAS NOT BEEN BEATEN.
The Forty-eighth Infantry marched out
to the Presidio yesterday and took the
place of the Forty-sixth, that earlier in
the day had left the camp and started for
the transport dock. The two regiments
passed each other on the way and before
night the Forty-sixth was well on tts
way to Manila, and the Forty-eighth was
enjoying Itself at the Presidio.
The Forty-eighth is one of the two
colored regiments mustered in under the
second call. It was rendezvoused at Fort
Thomas, Kentucky, and was recruited all
through the Southern and Eastern
States. Colonel Duval, who was lieu
tenant colonel of the Twenty -sixth, is in
command.
The regiment is something of a novelty
aside from the fact that it is made up of
negroes. It is the first regiment coming
here with colored officers, and it created
a great sensation on that account. All
the line officers, the captains, first lieu
tenants and second lieutenants of the
companies are colored. The field and
staff officers are white. The colored of-
Jicers were druwn from the regular army,
the best of the sergeants of the colored
cavalry regiments and a few from the in
fan try being chosen. Their colonel spe.iks
well "of them and says they will make
capable officers. The regiment has not
been more than seven weeks : .n existence
r" necessity drill has been sub
ordinated to target practice, so there are
many of the reiiuits who are a hit green,
but before they leave for the islands the
colored Forty-eighth will be up with the
In one thing it Is far ahead of anything
In the volunteer line that has so far
struck the Presidio; it has a band that
music. It is not a vehicle for
brazen boisterousness, but one that plays
It v. ere- a pleasure, not a duty. Be
fore the regiment started from .he ferry,
and while the band and headquarters
wen waiting for the column to form, tne
band played for the people coming to and
from the ferry, and there was not
one out recognize J Lhat the colored band
was worth stopping to listen to. The tn n
: up here and there just as the
regiment was, and in the few weeks they
:hey have made re
resa They have for leader
imaster of the Twenty
fltth Regiment, another colored com
mand, and they have taken hold of their
v> irk with true negro ear for music.
Already the question is going the rounds
among the mÂ«-n at the post as to whether
or not the negro officers Bhould be saluted
by the white privates, but it is only those
who know little of military law that
â¢ a moment discussing it. The white
soldiers will have to accord the colored
ra the courtesies due to their rank.
In military lew the man is not recognized;
It is the rank and the commission. The ;
colored ol'lcers have been commissioned
by the President, and no matter what the
subordinate may think of the man, 'he
must recognize the uniform and the
shoulder strap. The white officers are
compelled to do it when they meet a col
ored man superior to them in rank, and j
they lose nothing of their dignity in dcin;?
so, and the same rule must apply to the
white soldiers.
The regiment is as happy go lucky a
set "l" men as might well be found. Thert
were no prospects of supper last evening,
but there was no growling and no moping.
The men stood around and played games
and jumped and laughed and sang, ana
then when the call for guard mount came 'â 
they all trooped up the hill to watch the i
ceremony. Their principal work for the
next week or so will be drilling on the
hills, with two or three companies con
stantly at the range.
The Nevada cavalry will be mustered
out to-day. The men have four ninths
and a half in pay coming to them, two
month? of that amount being the gratuity
given by the Government. Rev. F. Vernon
Jones, a prominent clergyman of Reno,
arrived at the camp yesterday as a rep
resentative of the citizens of Nevada to
makr arrangements for the transportation
nf the troops home and to escort them
thore. The men will have a special car
attached tn the overland, which will leave

AMERICAN LOSSES IN
BATTLE AND BY DISEASE
WASHINGTON. Nov. 14.â Surgeon Gen
eral Sternberg"s annual report gives a
comprehensive view of the health ot the
troops on the field and at home, the
casualties and losses in battle and in hos
pital, as extended to the sick and
wounded and other information relating
to the physical welfare of the army The
total number of deaths in our armies in
cluding regulars and volunteers, from
May 1. 1898, to June 30. 1599, were fifilli of
whom 196 were killed in battle 216 killed
| by accident, 202 died of gunshot wounds
and wounds received in action. 2774 tiom
typhoid fever, 476 from malaria fever 3'>9
from pneumonia. 342 from diarrhea 'and
dysentry and 185 from yellow fever
As to food supplies. "General Sternberg
says he considered it wise to go slow in
changing the army ration until experience
has shown just what changes are "*as
suredly desirable. He refers to tne agita
tion over canned roast beef and re
| frigerated beef and says that at that time
v â  re on file only two complaints as
to th- beef supply. The only criticism
I made by medical officers, he says is that
: the ration for the tropics should have
1 less fat and more starch and sugar.
The report recommends an increase of
the medical corps and the establishing of
camping grounds through !h<- country
ready for troops when they are mobilized

WASHINGTON. Nov. 14.â Admiral and
Mrs. Dewey returned to Washington from
New York to-night. A Navy Department
official met them and escorted them to
the admiral's carriage, in which they were
driven to the home on Rhode Island ave
nue presented to the admiral by the
American people. The arrival of the dis

and when they stepped from the train and
walked to the carriage a number of the
passengers followed and saw them safely
off for home.
SEEKS WAR'S HARDSHIPS.
Nephew of the P^sident on His Wayj
to the Battle Field.
Lieutenant James F. McKinley of the
Sixth United States Cavalry arrived in
this city yesterday morning on his way
to Manila to join General Young's bri
gade > in the Philippines. He will be the
guest of Mr. and Mrs. George E. Morse
a: 157S Fell street during his stay here.
The lieutenant is the son of the late
James McKinley and a nephew of the
President. He was born in this city
twenty-one years ago. At the of
his parents when he was about 10 years
of age he went to live with the old Mc-
Kinley family at Canton. Ohio, where he
has since resided. On the breaking out
of the Spanish war he enlisted in the
United States regular army as a private,
and as such served through the campaign
THE EMPORIUM.
in Cuba, where he came near losing his
life through wounds and sickness. On his
return to the United States he was made
a second lieutenant in the Sixth United
States Cavalry.
JAPAN HOLDS THREE
OF THE PHILIPPINES
Were Not Ceded Because of the Igno
â¢ ranee of the Spanish-American
Peace Commissioners.
MADRID. Nov. 14.â 1n the Spanish
Senate to-day Senor Montero Rios, reply
ing to Co - int Almenas, who recently de
clared that owing to the ignorance of the
Spanish-American peace treaty com
missioners three islands of the Philip
pine groupâ the two Battanos and Cnla
yan island, both north of Luzonâ were
not included in the scope of the treaty,
said the islands referred to were not
ceded because they belonged to Japan
and were not claimed by the Americans.
Senor Rios urged the Premier. Sciior
Silvela. to demand a fulfillment by the
Americans of their engagements under
the treaty providing for commercial nd
vantages .'o Spain in the Philippines.
Senor Silvela replied that difficulties had
arisen in the execution of those stipula
tions in the treaty doubtless because
the Americans had not yet fully es
tablished their way in the Philippines.

RELIGION IN SCHOOLS.
I \ MERICANS may naturally be astonished at
, \ the missionary protest against the prohibit
*â  seel riai teaching in the public
â  Japan. Such teaching is not allowed in our
gioi re is l< ft as a matter <>:'
itruction. The schools are for the imparting
ufely Secular learning. The common schools,
. confined to 1 | function, are for the j
instruction of youth in the branches that may be
common to all. In them the right reading, speaking
â¢ â  â â â¢ - ( the English language is to be taught,
with arithmetic, the foundation of all mathematical
knowledge, and such history and geography a> are
the key to t tr< ures of knowledge in those
All thi~ is secular and necessary to the
future physical welfare of American citizen*. It is
itizenship that the state educates the young. If
it begin teaching them religion it goes outside its
on and steps off secular ground.
We are aware that much has been said about god
's, and that many religious bodies on either
side of the line of faith and practice which divides the
Christian world have sought to introduce religious
instruction. But it is the business of the state to
teach the known, not the unknown. It is strange,
therefore, that American missionaries should rage
because Japan pursues the same policy. ' She has a
ion, in Buddhism, which is agreeable to the
genius of her people. It is a religion of compassion
that docs not give the human race a monopoly of
pity, but embraces within its philosophy all living
things. Christians may treat it with polite respect
without in any way compromising their own beliefs.
If a plan of salvation which lifts man alone in its
arms be good, a philosophy that includes al! that
shares with man the gift and mystery of life cannot
be stigmatized as bad. If this religion of compas
sion, with help and pity and protection for all life, is
willing, in a country that it has satisfied for centuries,
to leave the schools free of its influence and occu
pied only with secular instruction, Christianity should
not object to stand upon a level with it in that re
spect.
It is the devout belief of Christian missionaries that
they carry a revealed message from on high, and in
the presence of that belief we all stand in awe. But,
armed with a commission bearing a divine seal, why
should they invoke the fleshly arm of human govern
ment? After reading the delivery of Dr. Lynnti
Abbott in favor of plowing the missionary field with
-.vord. enriching it with human blood, and sow
ing it with human bones and the marrow of the in
nocent as a preparation for a harvest of faith, one
may not be accused of irreverence for saying that
Christian missionarie^ ought to be sent to the Chris
tian missionaries I -hat they withdraw their
protest against secular schools and come home and
study Christianity.
It is to be hoped that the demand for diplomatic
pressure by our Government on Japan in this matter
will be resisted and refused. If our Government ap
pear abroad as the champion of ecclesinsticism in the
ie schools of another nation we don't know why
it should refuse to enforce the same rule at home. If
that come to pass there will be an end of our honor
able policy of religious toleration. Such toleration
: :< its best sense has never existed except where edu
â¢? is purely secular.
The two soldiers who poisoned sixty of their com
rades at the Presidio as a huge joke ought to be made
to feel how funny it is to be locked in an Alcatraz
dungeon. Their sense of humor is altogether too far
developed to permit them to remain at large.
After the cruel way in which the Governor trifled
with the feelings of Colonel Chadbourne the gallant
hero of dress parades ought tc have good grounds
for a suit against Gage for breach of promise. â 
The latest bulletin from the sickroom of Vice-
President Hobart says he takes milk with his meals
and milk punches between meals. "What's the mat
ter with Hobart? He's all right." â¢
We seem to be able to take everything in the Phil
fppines except Aguinaldo or a rest.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, ISrOVEMJJEII 15, 1899.
NEXT YEAR'S ELECTION.
THE Republicans of California have before them
an issue of prime importance, which will domi
nate the election in this State next year unless
it is sooner settled by the party itself. When we say
settled we mean adjusted in line with public opinion
and upright public sentiment.
A vacancy in the United Stales Senate is to be filled.
An effort to till it was prolonged through last win
ter's <essiu:i and tailed. It tailed because the rank
and tile of the party determined that the vacancy
tld be filled properly by a man fit for the place
or-not at all. It was this determination, adhered to
inflexibly by the people, that made tiie session in that
respect fruitless of results.
I'nless the seat is filled by one fit before the next
Ci mpaign the Senatorial is>ue goes into next year'
fight as an element of Republican weakness that may
not be overcome.
It is in no spirit of personal rancor or wish to in
crease friction, or cause anywhere a feeling of per
sonal humiliation, but with the purpose only of serv
ing the State and the party, that we say the party
cannot prevail next year either if Colonel Burns is
appointed by the Governor, or is elected by an extra
session, or is left to the decision of the voters next
November. I:' appointed by the Governor and seated
by the Senate the issue becomes rank and unquench
able. The appointment will hold only until the meet
ing of the Legislature in 1001. and the place must be
filled for the full term by that body. Not even the
strongest friend lei Burns is bold enough to
say that, as an open candidate, a Legislature can be
elected that will choose him. Xor can any one say
that if he is elected for six years at a special session
of the present Legislature the party can rally in 1900
from the effect of an act so disappointing to its rank
and file. Considering the effect of leaving the place
open, with neither appointment nor election, to be
filled by the next Legislature, it will be impossible to
eliminate Colonel Burns from the contest. He may
protest that he is not a candidate, but the protest
will be in vain. The Democrats will make him the
Republican candidate. The assault upon the Repub
lican party will be in the form of an assault upon his
personality, and it will not be possible for flesh and
blood to resist the temptation to defend him that will
be upon his personal friend-.
Let all Republicans study the situation and be
warned and be wise.
Since the election in this city the limitation to local
affairs and the anti-partisanship by which Mr. Phelan
secured the Republican votes which elected him have
evaporated. The country Democratic press, true to
the in>tinct> of sunflower partisan journalism, has felt
in the heightened light and heat that a new sun has
ris ( n, and has almost without exception turned to
Phelan a- the party's choice for Senator. If the seat
in the Senate be open next year he will be nominated
for it in the Democratic convention. lie will go be
fore the people in the honeymoon of his prestisje,
panoplied in the strength of his three successes in this
city, and who will stand against him? If Colonel
P>;:rn~ be on the scene it will be in vain that Repub
lican candidate^ for the Legislature declare they arc
not for him; the people will vote for Phelan, the man
in sight, for tear of the man in ambush.
In 1892 Stephen M. White was an avowed Demo
cratic candidate for the United States Senate. It was
known that any State convention of his party since
1886 would have chosen him had the issue been
pushed. True, the Examiner fought him and had a
candidate against him, but its candidate had not a
vote in the Legislature that would stick. White was
the only open, avowed, frank candidate. The Repub
licans had no candidate m right, but their campaign
was adumbrated by the suspected ambition of Mr.
M. 11. de Young. The Democrats made him the Re
publican candidate. Republican nominees for the
Legislature frantically disowned him. but not one
of them was able to tell the people whom he proposed
t<> support for the Senate. From the moment that
situation developed the end was in sight. White
won, and carried the electoral ticket under the wire
with him.
If the Republicans permit a like situation next year.
with Phelan in White's place, let them consider now
the result It i<= believed that if the Governor appoint
a Senator it will be Colonel Burns. This is based on
a sentiment of personal loyalty, we are told, which
in some situations would not be open to criticism.
Put that sentiment k misused when its satisfaction in
volves the overthrow of the Governor's party and
the loss of California to the Republican column next
year.
The Legislature is not dominated by any such sen
timent. It is in touch with the masses of the party.
If it listen to the voice of reason and bow to the
promptings of party loyalty and look forward to the
battles yet to be won or lost it has it in its power to
flank the Democratic situation completely and take
from that party the only issue upon which it can hope
to carry the State next year.
A USELESS OFFICE
REPORTS of the convalescence of Vice Presi
dent Hobart are doubtless received with grati
fication by all who notice them, but it is ques
tionable whether any considerable number of people
do so. In fact, a good many arc hardly aware the
Vice President is sick, and not* a few have forgotten
that the incumbent of the office is named Hobart.
The office is one in which the people have but
little interest Old John Adams, who was the first
man in the republic to occupy it, declared it to be
"the most insignificant office that ever the mind of
man contrived, or his imagination conceived." The
judgment thus pronounced at the beginning of the
Government has been confirmed by the experience of
later years, and Colonel Ingersoll once described the
Vice President as "an official who is paid a hand
some salary to stand round and wait for a funeral."
It is because of its uselessness that the people pay
but little attention to the incumbent of the office so
long as the President continues healthy and active.
Of course the public is sorry that Mr. Hobart is
sick, but the sorrow is due solely to the sympathy
with himself personally. They are sorry for the man,
but not for the Vice President. Indeed if the office
were to sicken itself to annihilation and pass out of
existence there would he little or no regret.
At no time was the office ever important except
that it provided a successor to the Presidency, but
since the adoption of the new law of succession it is
hardly of any importance at all. Under the old law
the succession was first to the Vice President and
then to the president pro tern, of the Senate. That
meant a possibility that the succession might go to
a man of a different party, for the presiding officer
of the Senate is not always a supporter of the ad
ministration. Under the new law it passes from the
Vice President to the Secretary of State, and from
him to the Secretary of the Treastiry, and so on
through the Cabinet. Thus there is no longer any
danger of a member of the opposi^jon succeeding to
the" Presidency, and therefore no importance at
tached to the Vice Presidency. If the Vice President
die there will be regret that a good man is dead,
but no regret whatever that we have no longer a
Vice President. In fact, under the new succession act
I there is no feason why there should be a Vice Presi
! dent, or why any one should be paid a salary to stand
; round and wait for a funeral.
REFORMS IN THE NAVY.
PRESS criticism upon those portions of the re
port of Rear Admiral Crowninshield which re
llectcd upon Congress and upon Admiral
Dewey have had the effect, it is said, of causing a
revision of the report, and when it is officially issued
it will be found to have been so altered that there will
be little or nothing in it to which any one can
rightly object.
The rear admiral has acted wisely in profiting by
the comments upon his work, and it is probable the
naval service will derive benefit from the wisdom,
for now that the objectionable features of the report
are eliminated more attention will be given to those
recommendations which are of genuine merit
Among the tilings to which the attention of Con
gress is directed by the report is the wastefulness and
inadequacy of the receiving-ship system, and the ad
vantages which would result if our warships out of
active service were manned by a skeleton crew and
kept in good repair, available for immediate service
in case of an emergency, instead of being laid up and
cared for only by watchmen. It is pointed out that
with our expanding commerce and our increasing
interests in all parts of the world it will no longer be
expedient to leave great battle-ships or cruisers
lying idle in port. There should be in the navy a
force sufficient to keep them all fairly well manned
and ready for use. To that end it has been recom
mended that the receiving-ship system be supplanted
by a policy of maintaining permanent barracks at the
larger naval stations at which accommodations could
be provided for the crews of the vessels held in re
serve and for the new recruits and apprentices
needed in the naval service.
The report made by Assistant Secretary Allen
relative to the naval militia contains recommenda
tions in line with those of the rear admiral. In sub
stance that officer says that as the personnel act has
made the term of service of enlisted men in the navy
four years, the same periods should be fixed for the
: enrollment in the naval reserve, and the reserve offi
cer should be promoted in war time with the regular
officer with whom he holds the same date of com
mission. It is also recommended that steps be taken
!<>r the organization of a permanent coast signal sys
tem from the retired list of the navy and the employes
of the lighthouse and life-saving service. There are sev
eral thousand of these men, and with a small appro
priation and an annual drill for a few days each year
they would be competent, the report says, to take up
their duties immediately upon the outbreak of war.
With a retired naval officer in charge of each light
house district, and an officer in charge at the Navy
Department and the necessary paraphernalia at the
nearest navy-yard ready for use, this necessary adjunct
of war could be put in working order in twenty-four
j hours.
It will be seen that the object of these recommenda
tions is to obtain an increase in the naval force of
the nation. Congress, while liberal enough in provid
ing for the construction of warships of various kinds,
has not been equally liberal in providing for the
maintenance of the number of men and officers neces
sary for manning the ships. The most important
naval work before this Congress, therefore, will be
that of making due provision for the care, mainte
nance and navigation of the fleets we have con
structed, and the reports of the two officers we have
quoted suggest the means by which it may be best
i accomplished.
THE ADUL TERATED FOOD PROBLEM.
AFTER a long rest the Senate Committee en
gaged in an : nvestigation of the extent to
which food a; . icles on sale in this country are
j either adulterated or wholly compounded of some
thing quite different from the articles they purport to
be has resumed its hearings, and we are once more
receiving information which will increase the demand
for the enactment of a pure food law. It is gratifying
to have the subject brought back to public attention
at this time, for Congress will soon assemble, and
efforts should be made throughout the country to
bring about the enactment of the desired law at this
; session.
The recent hearings have added nothing of any
particular value to the information already made
j public. In fact, the agitation for protection to the
j producers of pure foods against the ruinous compet
ing of the manufacturers of fraudulent articles has
been carried on so extensively that all who take any
interest in the matter at all are fairly familiar with the
subject. It is very well known that almost every ar
ticle of food in the market has a fraudulent article
competing with it, and that the frauds are so in
geniously devised that while in many cases injurious
to health they cannot be detected by either sight,
taste or smell.
The evil of the fraudulent trade is not due to adul
terations only. In many cases harm is clone by sell
ing unadulterated foods under labels representing
them as something different from what they are. For
example, the dairymen of New York, by careful su
pervision of the cheese product of that State, made
New York cheese a standard article of trade, won for
it a high reputation and gained a profitable market in
London. No sooner was the repute of the New York
cheese known, however, than fraudulent cheese :
makers in other States put the New York label upon
inferior cheese and sent it abroad. The result was
the ruin of the market which the New York men had
built up. In that fraud there was no adulteration. It
was simply a case of false labeling.
Many similar wrongs are done in the same way.
Some time ago in reviewing the fruit-packing trade
in that city the Philadelphia Record noted that some
enterprising firms there have been buying up dried
plums in districts where they are cheap and putting
them on the market labeled "California prunes." The
Philadelphia men are not the only packers who put
California labels on worthless or inferior fruits.
There is a great corporation in New York that grinds
tip apple-cores and apple-peelings and refuse apples
that are unfit for drying, and out of the stuff com
pounds jellies, jams, preserves of all kinds, and by
flavoring it in various ways makes it serve for apri
cot, peach, plum, orange, currant or any other kind
of fruit conserve there may be a demand for.
It is hardly worth while to gather further informa
tion on the subject. The people are aware that almost
every article in the market from luxuries to medi
cines is either adulterated or imitated. What is
needed is not more knowledge on that subject but a
clearer idea of the most efficient remedy. Up to this
time the best that has been proposed is a national
label law requiring every article to bear upon its label
conspicuously a true statement of what the article is
and where, when and by whom it was packed. Right
labeling will go a long way toward solving the diffi
culty of the problem, and an act requiring it is clearly
within the power of Congress to provide

YOUTHFUL ENGLISH PATRIOTS.
This picture, reproduced from the London Graphic, represents an Inci

THE LAST METEORIC SHOWER.
Mrs. W. J. Sloppy of St. Paul has kind
ly forwarded to Notes and Queries the
following clipping from a Philadelphia
newspaper of Thursday, November 18,
1833. which was rut from the paper and
preserved in a Ft-rapbook by her mother,
the late Mrs. 1,. G. Steep. It is certainly
a most rare and interesting paragraph, to
be thus reproduced at this date. This is
the description of the extraordinary scone
as given by an eye-witness on the day
of its occurrence: "The meteoric shower
of the 13th was a rare phenomenon. At |
4:30 o'clock in the morning I first observed
it, and continued to notice it until its ter
mination at 6 o'clock, two hours later.
From a point in the heavens about fifteen
degrees southeasterly from our zenith the j
meteors darted to the horizon in every j
point of the compass. These paths were
described in curved lines, similar to those I
of the parallels of longitude on an arti
ficial globe. They were generally short j
in their course, resembling much an in
terrupted line. They ceased to appear
when within about ten degrees of the hor- j
izon. I did not see a single meteor pass ;
the meteoric pole which I have described, j
nor one pass in a horizontal direction, j
Several of them afforded as much light as j
faint lightning. One of them in the north
east was heard to explode with a sound
like that of the rush of a distant sky
rocket. The time from the explosion was j
about twenty seconds, which gives a dis
tance of about five miles. It left a ser- j

OLIVE OIL MACHINERYâ H., Vaca
ville. Cal. If you desire to make olive oil
pentine cloud of a bright glowing color,
which remained visible for fifteen or
twenty minutes. Millions of these me
teors must have been darted in this show
er. I was not able to remark a single one
whose proximity to me was greater than
any other, by being interrupted between
my vision and any distant object, such as
trees, houses or the high shore of New
Jersey west of me. The singularity of
this meteoric shower consisted in the
countless numbers of the celestial rock
ets, and more especially in their constant
ly uniform divergence from the point fif
teen degrees southeasterly from the zen
ith." The writer closes his description
with the following explanation of the phe
nomenon: "These meteors are supposed
to bo gaseous, and when inflamed by some
cause not explained appear darting
through the heavens, generally in various
directions." The following editorial re
marks on the same subject appear in a
Philadelphia newspaper: "The remarka
ble display of meteors on Wednesday
morning continues to form the subject of
conversation in every circle, and our ex
changes come to us decked out with
graphic descriptions and Illustrations of
the strange visitation. A gentleman from
Boston describes the scene in that city in
much the same language as is used by
those who saw the wonder in Philadel
phia, and as far south and west as we
have heard from the shower of fire was
as incessant as it was in this city."
for your own family, you should use a
small cider press. Olive oil machinery is

AT PEACE WITH THE WORLD-A
and B, City. By the expression "at peace
with the world" is meant that the indi
vidual or nation has no quarrel with any
individual or nation or people. At this
time the T'nited States cannot be said to
be "at peace with the world." for they
have an armed contention with Aguinaldo
and his people.
RAISING A HATâ B. J. E., City.
"Should a young man who is a clerk for
a larpe corporation raise his hat when one
of the directors bows to him on the
street?" asks this, correspondent. He Is
Informed that no one can afford to be
rude to another, no matter how high or
how low the other is. If the director
thinks enough of the clerk to recognize
him on the street with a bow the clerk
should think enough of the director to be
polite to the extent of raising his hat in
recognition of the salutation. Civility
does not cost anything and always creates
a good impression.
UNITED STATES CIVIL SERVICEâ
Subscriber, City. T'nited States Civil Ser
vice examinations are held in San Fran
cisco generally in April and in Novem
ber. The dates are arranged by the Civil
Service Commission at Washington to

penmanship, copying from plain copy,
copying from rough draft, law and pen
sion law. For such positions the appli
cant must, as in all other branches of the
civil service, undergo an examination and
take his chance of being one of the eligi
bles. when a vacancy occurs. There is no
telling when a vacancy will occur in that
department in this city.

WEBSTER'S PLAN
IS CRITICIZED BY
HIS CO-WORKERS
Do Not Indorse New
Curriculum.
Superintendent of Schools Webster is
not to be permitted to inaugurate in the
city's schools the new curriculum which
he announced two weeks ago without the
criticism and even condemnation of many
of his co-educators, Although all of the
teachers and principals in the department
and all of the School Directors save those
of the board who are known to be agents
of the book ring an- with him. it has
come to his ears during the past week
that many of the big i,'uns outside this
county, and particularly thuse of the In
stitute, are preparing for a concerted at
tack upon him and his radical policy.
On October 23 Superintendent AVebster
issued a circular in which was embodied
the essence of all the experience he ha
had as head of the biggest municipal
school department in the West. By re
ports from the teachers in the department
and by his own el.>so observation he haa
become convinced that pupils in the local
schools would be better fitted for practi
cal life and advanced to a greater state
of preparedness for university work if
more time was given them for the study
of the essentials, and less attention di
rected to the frills that have been intro
duced into school work during the past
few years. He based his circular upon
that conviction, and ordered that such
subjects as "nature study," "humane ed
ucation," music, drawing and other the
orist innovations be either eliminated or
relegated to the luxury list, to be In
dulged in but once a week. The time
thus saved he divided between the essen
tials â grammar, arithmetic, spelling, com
position and the like.
The teachers in the department quit
talking about back salaries for at
a week, and parents hailed the new pro
gramme as the dawn of a new era in
local education. Not so, however, those
pedagogues who are fond of hemstitched
arithmetic and point laoe geography.
Many of them the last few years have
risen to fame and fat salary by their
ability to make the simplest study in the
ordinary curriculum look like a gaudy
piece of patchwork, and they object to
any one occupying as prominent a posi
tion in the educational world as does
Webster attempting to revolutionize the
ideas and experiments that have proved
profitable to them.
Oakland was first to raise a howl, al
though it was not a loud one and was
merely preliminary to the chorus that is
about due to be heard. The institute is to
come next, and it is known that a num
ber of prominent lecturers in that organi
zation are preparing condemnatory ;
to be read at the next meeting. M< an
whlle Webster, with parents, teachers and
the School Board back of him. is rapidly
getting his plan into smooth running or
der and gathering matter with which to
answer the arguments to come. Which
j ever way the present clash of opinions
turns out, the inevitable bandying of ar
guments, pro and con, promises much of
value td those addicted to pedagogy.

MYSTERY OF A
STOLEN RECEIPT

Some One Is Guilty of

was arrested for aiding and abetting a
lottery- He was taken to the Caiifornia
stree: police station, and a friend, Charlie
Poo, called and put up SIM cash bail for
his release. He obtained a receipt ':: â
the csÂ«r on duty. When the *Â«_?â¢ Â»aj
called in Judee Coolaa'a court the fallow
ing Monday SeÂ« "U'ah pleaded guilty and
a fine of Jli was imposed.
Charlie Foo was at a banquet in â â -â -â¢
town the folio wing 1 Thursday. November
S. when his purse containing J3- and the
receipt far the JlÂ» tail money stolen
from him. Friday morning a white man
called upon Clerk Rice of Judge Ccniar.'s
court and presented the receipt and got
an order en the City Treasurer for the
amount. The man signed Rice's book "A!
O'Neill." cut In the Treasurer's book he
signed :he name "H. Meyer" when the
meney was handed to him.
Charlie Fee reported tie theft of h!Â§
parse to police headquarters, but it was
not till Monday that the discovery of the
money having teen drawn from the
surer was made. Detective DUIor,
who was detailed en the case, asked Clerk
Rice tf !:e could girt any description of
the man who -resented the receipt to
him. but Rics rras enable to satisfy him.
as he could remember nothing. Dillon re
marked that the fact of a white man f-e
--s-cnti- a receipt for money put up by a
Chinese should have aroused suspicion in j
Bice's mind, but Rice thought differently.
The detective had no mere success in the
Treasurer's ofice tn getting a clew to ih*
identity of the man.
The fact w-is reported to Chief Lees
and he employed Theodore Kytka, the ex
pert on handwriting, to examine the sig
natures <_>n Rice's book and the Treas
urer's book in the hope that Borne clew
mig-ht be srotten of the forg-er. Kytka is !
now working ca the case. What puzzles (
the police is the peculiarity of the theft \
cf the purse, being 1 evidently the work cf
a Chinese thief, and a white man the nest
mcrnise presenting- the stolen receipt to !
Clerk Rice. There Is a suspicion that
when the facts re known a scandal may
be exposed that will !ea.d to trouble for
some people.

TEACHERS WILL MEET
TO DISCUSS SALARIES
MASS XEETIXG AT GISLS 1 HIGH
SCHOOL.
Will Try tc Collect Pay Held Up La
November and December,
1898.
The school teachers will get together in
a big mass-cveÂ«tlng at the Girls" High
School on Thursday to discuss the best
method of collecting the two months* sal
ary held up by the WaSler Board of Edu
cation In November and December, IS??.
The recent compromise with the mer
chant creditors of the School Department
left J2T.S3I In the hands of the Union
Trust Company to be divided among the
teachers and janitors in proportion to
their claims. That amount, however, is
far from enough to pay the pedagogues
in foil and they hesitate to accept it for
fear it will shut them out from any ben
efits likely tc accrue to them from the
citVs share in the "-" Inheritance tax.
Auditor Wells will attend the meeting on
Thursday and wiil explain the condition
of the available funds at the present
time and the teachers' committee is con
fident that some dennite plan of proceed
ure will bÂ« agreed upon.

Reports of the Southern Pacific bulletins
show that there ha 3 been a general let up

yesterday, and the fall there was very
trilling. â 'â ,': _,
In the country around Biker-
Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and about
Tehachapi the skies still remain overcast,

those sections might expect a little more

a while.
Reoorts from Fresno also give the

Judge Slogan's Decision la the Case \
of Frank Mitchell, Charged
With Murder.
Frank Mitchell, grocer, who shot and
killed Frank McAuliffe on October 5. [
was yesterday held to answer before f
the Superior Court by Judge Mogan on a j
charge of manslaughter, and the Judge
fixed his bonds at JCCOO.
ThÂ« Judge in reviewing the case said
he was satisfied the prosecution had not

led up to the shooting. The positive .Ie- ;
nf&] of Joe McAuIISTe that Mitchell had
BOt been struck prior to the shooting wa.3 \
compared with the statements of the >
police and others as to the condition of |
iliicheil's face and his clothing. The \
Judge was satisfied that the shooting was .
done In the heat of passion and .- the
tlm* a certain provocation existed. He \
thought :t better that 'the plea of self-dc- j
fer.se should be left to the jury.

BROUGHT CLOSE
TO DEATH BY A
"HELLO" SWITCH
Telephone Operator
Poisoned.
A BRASS BINDING THE CAUSE
COMPANY SEEKS TO SUPPRESS
NEWS OF THE CASE.
ilisa Mac Lowry. employed as an
operator by the telephone company at its
east ofSce at 1903 gutter street, is lying
at her home at 1J35 Vailejo street, at the
point of death from faiood poisoning, 'ihe
physicians called in to attend ncr offer
little hopo cf . . .-: recovery ar.d so far
have been able to do little to relieve r.er
suffering because of the peculiar and un
usual ca'-sa of her illness.
A few days a.za Miss Lowry cut ana
bruised the index finger of her right hand
while adjusting cne of the switca plugs
on the switchboard before her. She took
no notice of her wound at first; but later
noticed a deep discoloration round It and
felt severe pain. The pain and discolora
tion araduaily affectea her whole arm.
which by Monday night had swelled to
almost twice its normal size, and she was
compelled to take to her bed. Physicians
were called in, and upon learning the cir
cumstances surrounding the case im
mediately decided that she had been
poiscned by the brass binding on the
telephone plug. Every remedy was ap
plied, but the swelling progressed and
the pain Increased until almost her entire
rifht side was affected.
Upon iris* of 'â¢-- illness of its em
ploye the telephone company -' once
issued orders to -' -- ~~ " "' and to all of
the other girLa in tv employ who were
aware of her condition and the reason for
Jt to say nothing to any one concernir.g
thÂ«- cutter, and inquiries at the girl's
house -â --: to elicit any more
than that she was in a serious condition.
The company did everything rossible ..o
keep the case from the knowledge of the
public, but issued its orders too late, as
knowledge of the case had already rone
out among the medical fraternity and
Miss Lowry'a many friends about town.
GUILT OF IRA MOSS
CLEARLY ESTABLISHED
HIRED A SOLDIES TO PASS A
BAP BILL.
Falsely Accrued Mr. and 2lrs. HcMil
lea and Then Broke Dotm and
Confess6d That He Himself
Was the Culprit
S-ecret Service Agent uko and Ope
rator Cronin made further investigations
yesterday into the case of Ira Moss, held
in surveillar.ee for attempting to pass a
counterfeit United States cote, and after
subjecting- Moss to the sweating- process
swore to a complaint charging- him with
the offense for which he had teen held in
custody and formally arrested him and
turned him over to the United States Mar
shal.
Moss after repeated, denials of his
knowledge as to the character of the bill
finally made the statement that the bfl]
was given to him by J. 5. McMiiien, a
real estate dea!er of the firm of Darts &
MciUllen. McMillens wife keeps a lodg
ing house on Ellis street. Moss 1 story was
to the effect that McMiiien had received
the note in payment for some horses sold
by Mm. and that when he presented it
at the bank the bank officials advised
him to take the note to the Subtreasury
in case he (McMilien) had any doubt as
to Its not being a counterfeit. Moss de
clared further that MeMiilen had given
him the note and offered him JCS if he
succeeded !n passing it. Ross made no
denial of the fact that he knew the bfll
was bad. and admitted that he had of
fered two soldiers S3 if they would pass
the bill for him. He admitted also hav
ine given the note to Thomas rrew,
the soldier of the Forty-sixth Regiment,
to chanze Nolan's shoe store.
Mr and Mrs. McMiiien were summoned
to the United States Attorney's office in
the afternoon and made a statement
clearly establishing their innocence and
showing Mos3 to be a dead heat. Mrs.
McMiiien said that Moss came to her |
house shortly fore the arrest of the
soldier and showed her ths note, asking i
at the same time. "Ain't it a beaut V
They denied positively that they had ever
seen the note before. ;
Moss will appear before United States
Court Commissioner Heacock for prelim
inary examination at 13 o'clock this morn

HOARD OF H EAL TH ANSWERS.
Will Proceed to Cios- the Nyinpiiia
Hotel Unless Restrained.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Grand
Jury has arrived at the conclusion that
the notorious Nyniphia Hotel, 733 Pacific
street, is a necessary evil and snould be
allowed to exist, the Board of Health en
tertains a different view, and unless final
judement is entered against it in the Su
preme Court the oSicers thereof will close
the den of vice. An answer was filed in
the Superi>c Court yesterday by the
Board of Health through its attorney.
Georg â  A. Knight, to the petition of LU
lian Dale, the alleged proprietor of the
Nyrr.r In which she seeks, to enjoin
the board from carrying out condemna
lion proceedings and closing the place on
the ground that it is unsanitary and axtfit
for human habitation.
After making a general denial to each
and every allegation contained in the peti
tion filed by Lillian Dale a separate an
swer is joined with the original by che
board In which the character of the den
is fully set forth. It is alleeed that Lil
lian Dale Is not the proprietor of the place.
is alleged, but is simply an employe of the
Twinkling Star Improvement Company.
and hence the petitioner cannot be Irre
parably Injured by the closing of the
S'ymphia by reason of its unsanitary con
dition.
The answer is closed with a prayer to
the court to enter judgment dismissing
the defendants, with their costs, and
denying the petitioner's application for
an- injunction restraining the board from
proceeding to close the house In accord
ance with the resolution heretofore
parsed.

the subject of Russia's sale of the Ter
ritory cf Alaska, to America, are firmly
of the opinion that the territory in Ques
tion was included in the purchase, and
that it would be an unwarranted loss to
the United States to up any part
thereof to Uncle Sam's northern neigh
bor, no matter what the pretens* â of a
claim may be. The secretary was in

111. BEADING COURSES AND A
GIRL'S LIBRARY.
The Value of Reading.
This Is an era of knowledge. Women
and men of education were never more
needed than at the present day. The in
formation of- the daughter should when
she becomes a woman surpass that which
the mother possessed at the same age.
The attainments which suSced a quarter
of a century ago will not answer at pres
ent. It is not possible for every gin to
attend a high school until she receives a
graduation diploma. At the same time
it is cheering to know that very few
young persons have any excuse for grow
ing ny In ignorance. The most Intelligent
and useful women are not all included
among those who received the valued
pcrchment on commencement day.
HzKY a happy home Is presided over by
a woman whose name was never pub
lished In the honor class lists of school or
college. Chicago and other large cities in
America have thousands of homes made
comfortable and beautiful by ladies who
when girls had to assist in making a Uv
ing for themselves before the age cr â 
was reached. This Is not said to dispar
age the benefits of educational institu
tions. Indeed, the advantages of high
schools and colleges are becoming more
recognized every day. It is apparent.
however, that the great mass of people
cannot afford to remain long at school.
Are they to remain ignorant? Are the
many avenues of usefulness which are
open only to persons of intelligence to be
closed to those who scarcely entered the
grammar school? Has the girl who is
obliged to remain at home and to assist
her mother In housework no chance cf
becoming fairly well informed? Most
progress in knowledge cease for the one
who is no longer called by the teacher's
bell? Is the period of education ended for
the young women who work tn factories,
stand behind the counter or go out to
service? A negative reply must be given
to each cf these inquiries.
The giri who reads good books Is not
likely to remain uneducated. The benefits
of reading, observation and refiection are
open, to aiL The proper study of books
will put a young woman In possession of
knowledge which promotes her happiness
and usefulness. Knowledge will give her
skill tn discharging the duties of life and
increased power in executing Its purposes.
Marty a woman has received an inspira
tion from a book that has lifted her to a
higher position In society. There is no
more potent stimulus to a higher Ufa
than tlie words of good men and women
as recorded In their writings. Books make
people think. It Is the thoughtless gtrJ
that remains uneducated. Book 3 are a
means of refinement and culture. The
young woman who wishes to have a
clear head, a well-stored mind and a sym
pathetic heart will be helped in her pur
pose by judicious reading. The beauty
and grandeur of what is past or distant Is
dark to the person who does net read.
The girl who can read with appreciation
the work 3of eminent writers places her
self in contact with a spirit far larger
than her own. To hold converse with
the great and the rood is possible for
every one who will study the pages of lit
erature. The works cf Shakespeare, Mil
ton. Tennyson and Longfellow have power
to promote noble sentiments, to give re
finement of manner and to Inspire to
higher aims the struggle of life. No girl
can read the writings of Emerson, George
Eliot, Hawthorne or Dickens without feel
ing an impulse to greater usefulness. A

There re 3. Caw tables -which the ycur.g
student cf arithmetic will find It to his ad
vantage to know all the time; that is, to
know so well that a. ready reckoner will
not be necessary. The following may be
committed to memory:
There are 1160 yards cr 52=0 feet In a
mile.
There are 4 inches In a hand. 7.52 inches
in- a link and 5 feet in a fathom.
A surveyor's chain of 10} links Is equal
to 4 rods, or 22 yards, or â¬6 feet. There
are 220 rods cr SO chains in a mile.
The circumference of the earth Is di
vided into 350 degrees, each degree at the
equator containing S> knots, or nautical
miles: consequently the circumference of
the earthâ viz.. 121,353.4315 feetâ divided by
tSOXfO or 21.600 gives the length of a knot
âviz.. about Â«S feet. It may be remem
bered that â - knots equal ISO miles.
There are 4540 square yards in an acre
and Â£40 acres In a square mile. There are
ID square chains In an acre.
There are 27 cubic feet in I cubic yard
and 172S cubic Inches In a cubic foot. A
cubic foot of water weighs ISJQ ounces.
There are 12S cubic feet in a cord.
One cubic yard of solid earth is about
1U cubic yards after being dug-.

1. How many feet of lumber In D sticks
of timber each IS inches by IS inches and
each 33 feet long?
2. A board walk at a Â«eashore res - Â£3

MARY CARR'S DEATH.
Two Verdicts, One of Manslaughter,
Rendered in Her Case.
Coroner Hill held an Inquest yesterday
upon the body of Mrs. Mary Carr of
Twenty-second and Michigan streets, who
died last Saturday. The witnesses testi
fied to the fact of Carr coesle* fc==ie
Erst class newspaper . or magazine ha*
materially added to the enjoyment of
many a family. It Is no disgrace to have
been unable to gain a college education.
It is, however, almost inexcusable for any
one to remain Ignorant or illiterate tn this
age of valuable literature.
Hot to Choose Books.
----- object of reading is the for
mation of character. As an instrument
cf education, the only test to apply to a
book !s the benefit it confers on the
reader. TThen a gir! takes up her time
with a bock she should feel satisfied as
to its wort Dees it supply her with use
ful knowledge? Knowledge ir valuable.
bat probably the greatest benefit a book
confers comes from i:s sug-gestiveress.
The Inspiration rained Is serviceable only
-i. -_ - It can be turned to good account.
If a book uzrÂ£t3 for life's duties or do=3
not produce good thoughts it should be
thrown .aside, Many a young woman has
read a hundred books and has less Intel
ligence than one who has limited herself
to a dozen. Not only so, but it Is un
fortunately true that harmful books ara
not read by boys alone. Many books are
also dangerous no^ so much on account
of the <zacstlonat>le morals they teach as
en account of the check they give to in
tellectual growth. The influence of what
one reads can be avoided no mere than,
the air that is breathed. The intellectual
atmosphere In which seme girls -ive pro
motes naental stagnation- A rourg
woman has been known to be so absorbed
In a trashy novel while traveling for the
first time through Switzerland -3 to be
oblivious to the grandeur of the scenery
visible from her car window. -
It is cot enough for a girl to avoid bad
bcoks. Of good works a choice must be
made. The most industrious reader must
b-Â» sa-tisSed to remain- Ignorant cf thou
sands of valuable books. It is
estimated that I3.C<XJ new books ap
pear every year. Some libraries
contain as many as 3.C<!O.C*Â» vol
umes. It is evident a judicious choice is
essential. Life is too short for time
to be washed. "Every 'book," says Fred
eric Harrison, "that we take up without
a purpose is an opportunity lost of taking
up a book with a purpose: every bit cf
stray Information which we cram Into
our heads without any sense cf its im
portance Is for the most part a bit ot
most useful information driven out of our
heads and choked off from our minds.
â¢ â¢ â¢ To know anything that tunas
up is. In the Infinity of knowledge, to
know nothing. To read the first book we
come across in the wilderness of books
is to learn nothing." Schopenhauer well
says: "It i 3 of permanent importance to
acquire the art not to read; in- other
words, of not reading such bocks as oc
cupy the public mind, or even those which
make a noise in the we rid and reach sev
eral editions." To have read the best
books thai have been written by the best
writers Is to have mastered a great deaf.
Matthew Arnold with much truth re
marks: "For when we say that culture
is to know the best that has been thought
and said in the world we imply that for
eÃlluw a, system directly tending to this
end Is necessary in cur reading." It is cf
the first Importance to every girl that she
should-read such books as will foster the
highest type of womanhood, and prepare
her to be a useful member of society.

Dried Fruit in New York.
The New York Commercial says:
"There is a fair demand for all ' varieties
of dried fruHs, bui r.o orders are large. Th* !
outlook is encouraging, however, and holders
are confident that prices on all varieties will j
Improve with the advancing season. Stocks j
are not heavy for the season, but there seems
to be fume reluctance to buy in large quan
tities and speculative interest Is entirely want-
Ing. The feeling among holders is one of con
lidence, but there Is little attempt to force !
the mnrkiit by urging sides which might react I
and injure those who undertook such tactics. I
"The total pack of peaches Is placed at
1300 cars, against an estimate of 15W to 2000
cars made earlier in the season. Probably
not 200 cars are now left In first or second
hands. Everything is cleaned out on orders j
with eight -months' consumption ahead. By
the end of the year practically nothing will be ;
left. Prices are very tirm and trade is mod- !
erately active, but buyers show no inordinate >
dt-sire to load up.
"Prunes appear to be moving moderately
well on the coast, but if holders would meet I
li'.jyers' â â â < better there would be more
business. The heavy carry over of lost sea- I
eon's goods' had a depressing effect all the I
year, but.lt Is understood that what are left
will soon be cared for and that the new crop I
will then have clear sailing. Large holders
are confident and show no disposition to urge
sales. Higher prices are looked for.
"Pailsins are steady, but the high price of
California goods is forcing handlers to take i
larger quantities of foreign varieties, par- j
ticularly the Malaga layers and Valenclaa, j
which can be laid down In this market s@Sc
under similar grades of California goods.
L r Â»ose Muscatels ire steady, but trading ap
pears to be rather lighter at present, con
sumptive wants seeming to have been satis
fied."

EASTERN MARKETS,

NEW YORK. Nov. n._T>rices of stocks
traversed , lite a wide range during the day
throughout the list, but net changes are almost
fractions, and the majority on the side of
losses. Money market prospects continued the
dominant Influence In the trading. The events
of yesterday had turned nearly an the traders
on the bull side, and the market opened with
an upward move] In prices, which extend
ed to a large fraction on the avarage before
a reactionary tendency 'loped. Continued
buying by London helped on the advance and
there was special strength In a number of In
dividual stocks, notably In General Klectric
which rose an extreme four points on'rumors
of an extra dividend, and consolidated Gas
which .was up at one time five points on a
periodical rumor of a settlement of the local
gas war. There was a continuance of the
heavy absorption of Southern Pacific which
gave a healthy tone to the railroad llstl Profit
taking sale* In this stock were detected at an
early period of the trading and had not a little
to do with checking the general upward ten
dency. The decisive inlljenoo in turning prices
downward was the realization that yesterday's
easing of the money rate v.-aÂ« due to a sporadic
supply of funds and not to any radical chance
In the condition of the money market. a large
portion of the funds loaned yesterday was at
tributed to a cash deposit by one of the rail
roads- for t'je purpose of taking up an old
underlying issue of bonds. This supply of
money had the effect of offsetting the calling
In pf loans .at the bank?, â¢ made necessary by
the depletion 01 reserves and prevented the
stringency of the money market, which had
been feared. The effect was manifest to-day as
well â 'â  yesterday, the rate for call loans not
sroinK above 7 per cent and ruling generally
below that But the sterling exchange rate
showed a quick response to this easing of the
local money rate and moved an. additional
fraction upward away from the gold Import
point This caused a cessation or the talk of
immediate gold imports, on which was based
the upward movement of yesterday in stocks.
Thus the hope of relief by an upward move
[ ment of gold had to be abandoned for the time
being. In the meantime the absorption of
funds by the sub-treasury and the probable
continuance of demands from the Interior have
still to be reckoned with. Discouragement
overcame the operators /or a rise and they
proceeded to. sell out their holdings, wiping out
the rlter gains and carrying prices below last
, night's level.
Considerable speculative activity la diverted
to the cotton market, where the development
â  of a foreign demand indicates the relinquish
' ment by foreign buyers of their altitude of
j waiting for lower prices. As bearing on the
general money situation, it is Important to
note that advices from the South report money
in abundant supply there, po that planters
have been able to obtain accommodations tor
holding their cotton for higher prices. The
largely Increased supply of cotton bills in the
exchange market in the last few days with the
movement In cotton will naturally result in the
early release of fund? in the South and hasten
the return flow of money from that region.

London Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. 14.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: '
The markets here were cheerful at the opening
to-day, but they weakened on fear of dearer
money. The County Council six months' bills
for Â£600.000 went high, averaging Â£4 Ss 7d pre- I
mlum. This with yesterday's fall in American
exchange caused consols to drop 3-10 to 10%.
Americans began strong, half a point above
parity. There was feverish buying until after
noon, when prices weakened on early sales
from New York, which then bought t-llghtlv,
but finally sold, making the close weak. The
strongest feature was Southern Pacific, due to
operations at the Speyer's. The range was
45-H to Â«4-', Spanish fours were 64%; Tlntos,

coin and sent Â£Â 000 to the Continent.
Bills were nominally 4% to-day, awaiting the
payment to-morrow on the Â£3.(00,000 treasury
bills and the change settlement. No great
squeeze Is expected, as the market Is prepared.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. 14.-Reports of light domes
tic receipts were the only Items that bulls
could confront the bearish array of statistics
with at the opening of the wheat market to
day, the initial December G6V&QjÂ°GC?ti,
May 70te@70%â showed a loss from yesterday's
close of from He to %Â«. The chief factor in
the weakness was the prediction of an Argen
tine crop authority that prospects pointed to a
large Argentine crop. Harvesting of this crop
began last year on November 19, and the pre
diction, evidently not much in advance of the
beginning of harvesting, had immediate effect.
Liverpool, which had opened firm, declined and
closed weak. The market here rallied after
the opening on covering by shorts and buying
apalnst puts, December touching 66% c and May
7.. â Â.. On profit-taking December eased off to
f.G'&c and May to 70% c. An Impression that the
continuous liquidation of the aaÃt few days
had resulted In an oversold market was ap
parently verified when shorts in greater num
ber again sought cover. â  This was little apt to
be had at the low mark and prices steadied
December advanced to 67Hc and May to 71Hc
December ! closed ',ie over yesterday at 67% c
and May Vie to Vie higher, at 71>4!g'71*Â»c, both
options bavins eased off a bit on profit-taking
near the close.
There was an increase in the world's visible
of 7,000,000 bushels, almost double expectations
Advices from Argentina were that including
wheat left over there would between 90.000 -
000 and 100,000,000 bushels for export next year
Corn was weak early with wheat, but the
loss was more than recovered. December closed
Me to He lower, at 31V4@3^c May closed un
changed, at 32H0.
Oats followed In the wake of, the other mar
ketÃ. The spread between May and December
was narrowed to . a difference of lHe. Brad

December closed He higher, at 22^ac; May Vie

against 27.200; on the way to this port. ]Bi,ooo
tonÃ. against 147.000.
WHEATâ Chicago opened at a further decline,
owing to bearish news and lower quotation!
from Liverpool and Paris. The weakness was
accentuated by fSradstreet's report <ot an In
crease of 7.000, c00 busbele In the world's visible
supply, nrcr.mhall reported a poor spot de
mand In England, and Goodwin predicted a
great Argentine crop.
The market wan active at the decline, how
ever, and later developed a better tone. The
Northwest receipts last week were only 800
cars, against 2000 for the same week last 'year,
and there was good cash buying, with New
York and St. Louis leading.
This market was strong In sympathy with
the later news frmn Chicago, and futures were
higher, as will be seen.

ANNIVERSARY OF
CALIFIA PARLOR
Banquet and Reception
in Senate Chamber.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 14.â Califia Par
or, Native Daughters of the Golden
"West, celebrated its twelfth anniversary
by giving an Invitation dance and ban
quet in the Capitol to-night. The Senate
Chamber was transformed into a tempor
ary dancing parlor and was most exqui
sitely decorated.
The banquet, which was a most elab
orate affair, was held in the Assembly
Chamber. The banquet tables, eight in
number, all radiated from a common cen
ter and represented the spokes of a gigan
tic wheel. They were profusely decorated
with cut flowers and were adorned with
candelabra with pink candles.
About 200 Native Sons and Daughters
were seated at the tables, and the whole
presented a magnificent scene, the hun
dreds of incandescent lights and pendant
crystals giving the large nail an unusually
brilliant appearance. There were ten
toastÃ, and they were ably responded to
as follows:
"Welcome." Mrs. Belle Prouty, presi
dent of Califla Parlor: "The Pioneers,"
Mrs. Emma Gett; "Our Fair City,"
POSTUM CEREAL.
EASY GOOD. EASY BAD.
IMscovers a Difference.
"After twenty years of coffee drink-
ing a-nd a good portion nf the time suf-
fering from severe headuehes and nerv-
ousness, I finally waked up to the fact
that the coffee was the cause of the
trouble.
I was led to accuse coffee of being
the cause of the difficulty by reading
about P> stum Food Coffee. Since us-
ing Postum I have been singularly free
from any of the ailments mentioned.
"It is easy to make good Postum and
easy to make bad. The difference is in
the boiling. I send you herewith a list
of friends I know would be benefited
by leaving "ff coffee and using Postum
Food Coffee. Kindly send them infor-
mation on the subject."â G. H. L. Nel-
Eon, Principal School No. 2. Greenfield,

At the conclusion of the banquet the
Native Sons and the fair native daugh
ters sang Auld Lang Syne and left for
their homes with promises of happy
recollections of the auspicious event.
The anniversary was under the control
of the three principal committees. The
banquet committee, with Mrs. Belle
Prouty as chairman; entertainment com
mittee, Mies Belle Johnston, chairman;
decoration comjnittee, Mi3s Jennie Davis,
chairman.
They were assisted by sixteen other
members of the parlor. The president of
the parlor, Mrs. Belle Prouty, was the
toastmaster at the banquet.
FRIENDS AND ADMIRERS
GREET FATHER YORKE
HE IS THE GUEST OF HONOR AT
A FINE BANQUET.
Not the least successful of the many
receptions given to Father Peter C. Yorke
in honor of his return was that tendered
to him by a number of his personal
friends and admirers at the California
Hotel last night. The reception took the
form of a sumptuous banquet and seven
ty-five guests gathered at the festaJ board
to testify the high regard in which they
hold the popular clergyman.
Seated at the head of the table w-as
the guest of honor and on his right sat
General Warfleld and Father James .Mc-
Donald, while on his left were Father
Philip O'Kyan and Colonel J. G. Giesting.
During the enjoyment of an excellent
menu a stringed orchestra discoursed
sweet strains of the latest musical selec
tions and when appetites had been sati
ated toast master Frank Drady, in a few
well-chosen words, introduced the guest
"f the evening. At the mention of Father
Yorke's name the gathering broke into
tumultous applause, followed by the sing-
Ing of "Home Again."
Father Yorke in the course of hi 3 re
sponse to the toast "Our Friend" ex
pressed his appreciation of the splendid
reception accorded by those whom he con
sidered among his best friends. He spoke
of his travels in foreign climes and re
ferred to the influence of American ideas
across the ocean.
'We have demonstrated to them," said
Father Yorke, "that this country is a
H in Its government, its business, its
democracy and its people, and we have
certainly manifested our ability to take
care of ourselves in the late unpleasant
ness."
After the applause which greeted Father
Yorke's remarks had subsided Corporal
John Miller of the First California Volun
teers sang an original song entitled
TILL: bAl> I<*UA2% CISCO CALL, W-,D.SJ3SI>AY, 2<UY.OIJ3EIi 15, 1899.
"Sleeping in the Philippines To-night"
and was followed by Father O 1 Ryan, who
spoke sincere words of praise for his col
league, who, he said, "had come back to
take up the cudgels once more in behalf
of truth and justice."
The rest of the programme consisted of
a recitation by Daniel Murphy; remarks
by Father McDonald: Cakewalk by
Messrs. Murphy and Owens, and speeches
by J. T. McCormick and Dr. James
Kearney. The festivities concluded with
three cheers for Father Yorke. Follow

Funston and wife will leave here to-mor

the general will sail for Manila. The
general Is afraid the war in the Philip
pines will be over before he reaches his
destination. General Funston will drop
the suit for libel against Archbishop Ire
land. Hf; said to-night:
"I will do nothing further about It so
far as the Archbishop is concerned. If I
take any action it will be against the
papers that started the story. I have
found the author of these llbelous reports
He was a ramp follower. He deserted
from an English sailing ship and followed
us during the campaign. He was fined
three times in the provost court for
drunkenness and disorderly conduct. At
Maralo I found him in a private house
and ordered him under arrest as he had
no business there. The paper that print
ed his story said that it was from a re
liable newspaper man. He stowed himself
away on board the Tartar when we left
Manila, and when he was discovered re
fused to work. Colonel Metcalf placed
him on bread and water for two weeks,
and he swore vengeance against us both
He made no attack on Metcalf. but made
this one on me."

MURDER ADDED
TO THE CRIMES
OF DESPERADOES
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Nov. 14.
John Thomas, the saloon-keeper of |
West Oakland, shot In the head by j
masked robbers last Sunday night, died ;
at the Receiving Hospital this morn- |
!ng, having been unconscious since he '
fell before his bar.
The death of Thomas renders it hardly
probable that the gang who robbed his ;
saloon anij murdered him will be caught,
as there is absolutely no clew upon which
to work. The bullet that caused death :
was embedded in Thomas' brain, and al- j
though the doctors probed several times
they were unable to locate it exactly or
to extract it.
Thief of Pnlire. Hodgkins ordered the
release to-day of Ed Scott, the last of '
the suspects, who was found among the
box cars near the scene of the murder.
"It is certain to my mind." said the |
Thief, "that all these robberips and hold
ups are the doings of one gang, who are
apparently not amateurs. If they keep
on at thtir game they will run into some
saloon some nitrh: whore the proprietor
is ready to receive them and they will ;
end up in the morgue."
It has been suggested that therp is al- '
together too much ornamental work in
the Police Department. Chief Hodgkins,
when asked to-day, paid that there are
sixty-one men in the department, of
which number forty-two are patrolmen.
These patrolmen are divided Into two
watches,' of which the night watch has
about thirty men. This number is said
to be altogether too small to look alter
a city which reaches from Fruitvale to
the bay. and from Berkeley town line to
the estuary, and has a population of over
70,000. The nineteen men, nearly a third .
of the whole department, who do not pa
trol, are distributed into Chief of Police,
captains, sergeants, bailiffs, clerks, Jail- ]
its and patrol wagon drivers.

FLAGMAN MEETS
DEATH BENEATH
TRAIN WHEELS
OAKLAND, Nov. 14.â PatrtcX Connor.
the aged flagman at the railroad cross
ing of Stanford street and San Pablo ave
nue, Golden Gate, to-night risked his life
to save the lives of an expressman named
O. Olsen and the latter's daughter, and
met death in a somewhat peculiar man
ner. The 6:45 o'clock Berkeley local,
bound for the Oakland mole, was rapidly
nearing the crossing, when Flagman Con
nor was suddenly apprised of an ap
proaching express wagon driven by O. Ol
sen, at whose side sat his daughter. Con
nor shouted at the top of his voice and
excitedly waved his danger flag to warn
Olsen as well as Engineer Clark of th*
local. Instantly Olsen turned his horses
to one side, but being unable to turn
away sufficiently to avoid a collision he
and his daughter jumped for their lives
and escaped with only a few bruises. Be
fore Engineer iark could stop his train
the locomotive crashed into the wagon
and th>- latter vehicle was hurled against
and upon th<> flagman.
P. Ward, residing at 1083 Crawford
street, was an eye-witness. He said:
"Connor had just flagged the train for a
clear track, and. turning about, probably
saw Olsen driving up. He made a des
perate effort to save the expressman from
being hit by the train, but the latter ap
peared to get rattled and jumped with
his daughter for safety, when the train
struck the wagon and pushed it over on to
Connor. I think Olsen was driving to his
home in Golden Gate."
Deceased, who was a native of Ireland,
aged 60 years, had resided in this city
twenty-two years. He leaves a widow,
three "daughters and two sons, all residing
at 223 Etta street, near B. Golden Gate.
An inquest will be held to-morrow night.
A whisper in a country village continues
to echo for weeks.

; added, it was necessary that the budget
I be speedily discussed.
The .King announced the projected bills, i
including measures for the mitigation of j
the taxation laws, and dwelt upon the
notable economic Improvements in the i
kingdom.
Adverting to foreign affairs, King Hum- i
bert said Italy's relations with the pow- i
ers were excellent and that nothing i
menaced the country In any direction, i
He alluded to Italy's participation in The i
Hague peace conference and after en- J
larging on the responsibility of . Par Vi- â¢
ment to secure to the country progress
and the development 01 its economic
resources, continued:
"Tha forthcoming celebration of the
holy year will be a signal event for tue
Catholic world and our epoch and will af
ford us an opportunity of showing once i
more how dearly we respect and cause to
be respected the obligation we assumed
when, in achieving Italian unity, we
j made good the title of Rome to be the
capital of the kingdom of the Italian
people. I am watching you, gentlemen,
and I await your labors with confidence.
May they be as fruitful as the events re
quire. The innate satisfaction arising !
from the accomplishment of your duty j
will be your most cherished ieward, and
the good you have done the country by
strengthening the confidence of the
country in the national institutions. This
is the dearest wish I can form to-day, as
King and an Italian, that you will so act.
I am convinced that I will have the
satisfaction of seeing my desire realized.
Everything leads to the hope that the '
notable economic revival In Italy will
continue and that by sedulous work, by
the utilization of our productive energies,
and by the Intelligent and assured pro
tection of our agriculture and industries,
we will be able to lay solid and endurable
foundations for the reforms of which so '
much has been said, but which have
never been realized."
The royal party was acclaimed by the
people as it proceeded through the troop
lined streets to the Senate chamber and
was heartily cheered on its entrance into
the hall. The same scenes were wit
nessed when their Majesties returned to

PLANS FOR FLOOD-WATER STORAGE
Good Day's Work
Put in at the
Convention.
THE first day's work of the water
storage convention has been com
pieted. Judging last night from
8 the expressions on night from
the expressions on all sides
everybody is more than satisfied
â with the progress made in the
direction of speedy results, and delegates
â¢will be prepared this morning when they
meet again in Metropolitan Temple to
get into the middle of things and marshal
a good working plan out of the many of
fered.
Four hundred and eighty-one delegates
answered "present" yesterday morning in
the maple hall of the Palace Hotel when
the roll was called. This unlocked for
response to the invitations of the provis
ional committee had the Immediate effect
of putting everybody in good humor. The
hearty welcome of the Mayor made tne
out-of-town delegates feel at home and
In the mood to return the compliment to
San Francisco, which they did handsome
ly by the nomination and election of F.
\V. bohrmitnn. president of the Mer
chants' Association; as temporary chair
man, which choice later in the day was
made permanent. Mr. brmann's fltness
for the office becoming apparent during
the short hour of the morning session.
During thÂ« afternoon? when the conven
tion moved to Metropolitan Hall, and
after the order of business had â en de
termined and permanent organization had
been effected, th< real test of the temper
of the convention was had. It was known
that, as far as such a condition could
exist without previous caucusing, the del
egates were massed on two sides, those
favoring State aid for water storage, and
those opposed. When the resolutions be
gan to pour in for reading and discussion,
beforo reference to the committee on res
olutions, there was an evident feeling of
uneasiness among the delegates, as if
they expected something to drop. Never
were delegates more agreeably surprised.
Plans were offered, it is true, diametric
ally opposed to each other, and their ad
vocates were equally eloquent, but all
through the long afternoon there was
manifested a spirit of earnestness and
fairness and a willingness to reach com
mon ground that left no room for bitter
ness. There was none, and if the actions
and expressions of the delegates after
adjournment can be taken lor anything
there will be none.
Xo plan seems to be more favored at the
present time than any other, but no fears
are voiced that it will be impossible to
reach one. In fact, the signs are plain
that a practicable method will be out
lined for future successful crusading tor
the speedy storage of the waste waters of
the State. These signs have been thrown
out by delegates, who express a willing
ness, "lHce Pillsbury of Tulare, to take
everything and anything In sight, so long
as it leads in the direction of ultimate
success. They are not committed to State
bonds, nor are they pledged to exclusive
Federal aid. They will take both, and
impound the waters of the State as quick
ly as possible.
And it is tho influence of these men in
the convention, with the earnestness and
evident fairness of the out-and-outers of
the other factions, that will tend to make
smooth the work of the convention.
The ceremonial attending the opening of
the convention was delightfully informal.
The assembled delegates were still in the
buzz of early congratulations over the
large attendance, when a loud rapping
from the platform attracted their atten
tion to the ilgure of Mayor James D.
Phelan.
"I have been requested," he said, "to
call this convention to order."
His words were greeted with applause
that testified that the popularity of San
Francisco's executive head extended far
ther than the confines of the city. He
rapped some more and the delegates hav
ing seated themselves, he extended a
greeting on behalf of the city. He said:
I desire to extend the welcome of
San Francisco to those gentlemen
from ail parts of tho State who have
come here to unite â I hope to unite
in some great measure for the bene
fit of California. , There certainly
should be a common sentiment among
all the members of this convention, so
far at any rate as the benefits that will
accrue from the storage of flood wat
ers are concerned. But as to the best
means of reaching that desirable end
there may be a reasonable difference
of opinion.
I am not very familiar with the dis
cussion which has preceded this con
vention but I am informed that al
ready there are two parties â one con
tending that it is the duty of the State
to provide for the storage of the flood
waters, and the other that it is the
duty of the Federal Government. Now
there can be no doubt whatever In the
mind of any one that if the Federal
Government would undertake this
â work it would relieve California of a
great outlay; but, on the other hand,
so desirable is tho storage of flood
waters that if there is any possibility
of losing this opportunity we should
not wait upon the Federal Govern
ment.
So important, In my judgment, is the
storage of the storm waters of Cali
fornia that we must m?ke any sacri
fice of our personal views to bring
about harmony of action, i think the
two years of drought we have had have
taught â¢<:- the lesson that, no matter
what may be the outlay for this pur
pose within reasonable bounds, it
would well repay the State.
A great city like San Francisco is
complimented by gentlemen coming
from all parts of the State to meet
here. A great city is the spokesman
for a great country. We have here a
metropolitan press "to voice your senti
ments. We have here the men willing
to come to your aid. These are the
natural advantages which come from
metropolitan activity we are willing
to lay at your feet. Without a pros
perous California in mines and fields,
San Francisco would have no large
place on the map. We have plenty of
water here at our doors for shipping,
but we must have something to ship.
I trust your deliberations will bring
about a solution of the great and im
portant question and the welfare of
our commonwealth. '
"I am now ready," said the Mayor, "to
hear nominations for temporary chair
man."
T. E. Gibbons of 1..0S Angeles nom
inated F. W. Dohrmann in behalf of
Southern California-
Arthur R. Briggs, In behalf of the cen
tral part of the State, seconded the nom
ination, and Mr. Dohrmann was made the
unanimous choice of the convention. On
taking the chair he said:
When the ancients had entered upon
a war they generally proceeded before
a battle to offer up a sacrifice that
they might propitiate the gods: and
when peace had been accomplished
they again offered sacrifice to thank
the gods for victory, i presume you
know what I mean without much fur
ther explanation. There seemed to be
war in the air and San Francisco
wished to win. Looking around for a
victim to be sacrificed, they selected
me, not for any of those qualities
which were usually requisjte for sac
rifices in the ancient times when they
selected young people of virtue and
many other good qualities. They se-'
jected me because I was a negative
quantity in all those matters, and I
have to begin by stating to you what
I stated to them, that, while I am
willing to be sacrificed, my qualities
fall short of those which are neces
sary to preside over this convention
as It should be done.
I begin, therefore, by appealing to
your sympathy and ; sking you, while
you may assist in the sacrifice, that
â¢ you will not put me In the hole on
parliamentary questions and crucify
â¢ "'Gentlemen, you will please excuse
â¢his explanation. It is like that of
the boy who goes by a graveyard and
whistles that he may have courage. I
realize we have serious work to do. I
realize that I am facing serious men
who have come here and Intend to do
it I hope that the gods are appeased
and harmony will prevail so far as the
ultimate object of our gathering is
concerned I hope and expect that a

had upon all subjects which are mci

Frank J. Bynames moved a recess until 2
o'clock to Metropolitan HaU.
George H. Maxwell said ,hat this was
the most Important ention that had
been held in California for a quarter of a
century, and there would not be a;:
to equal it in Importance in the next
quarter century- would It not be well,
he said, for all who had plans to submit
â¢ing them before the convention in
writing and make such remark- as th<
planmak^r wished?
Mr. Works of Los Angeles agreed with
the suggestion of Mr. Maxwell.
Delegate Devlin of Sacramento called
for information. He wanted to know how
far and in what direction the (.invention
wished to go. He moved that the chair
call for addresses from delegates who
had given the matter of flood water stor
age their attention and study before the
convention should proceed to take any
definite action.
Chairman Dohrmann said tho conven
tion ought first to organize. He did not
wish to make b â  -lven
tlon, but if the discussion of sub â¢
should begin at once it would be i
absence of any organization. The first
duty of tho convention was to organize.
He did not think that the plan of ap
pointment from Congressional districts
of the committee on permanent organiza
tion and order of business was the best.
Mr. Gibbons of Los Angeles moved that
the committee on permanent organiza
tion and order of business should consist
of nine members, to be appointed by the
chair. This motion prevailed, and
chair named the following to constitute
the committee: Hon. C. B. I
Angeles; E. C. Farnswnrth, Visalia; \
R. Brigcs. Fresno; P. R. Garnett. Glenn-
R. E. Wilhoit. Stockton; R. M. Shackle
ford, San Luis Oblspo; A. B. Lemmon,
Sonoma; C. C. Bush, Shasta; Hugh Craig,
San Francisco.
Delegate Adams of Santa Cruz moved
the appointment by the temporary chair
man of a committee of fifteen on resolu
tions. This was adopted.
The chair requested that any delegate
who had a suggestion to offer conreri,:: p
the personnel of the committee on r<
tions should hand in names. He would
not name the committee, he said, until
he had been made fully acquainted with
the wishes of the convention.
Upon motion of Will S. Green, an invi
tation was given to Elwood Mead to ad
dress the. convention. Mr. Mead spoke
briefly, not going into the questions to
come before the convention, but assuring
th* delegates that he believed whatever
they planned would be good.

An announcement by the chair that res
were In order brought Edward
F. Adams of Santa Cruz to his feet. He
pri Bented a resolution that it was the
Bense of the convention that it favors the
lishment of a permanent society,
whose membership shall come from all
parts of the State, which shall include
Ã¼bordlnates or by amalgamation
all existing societies, and which shall be
indorse.! by citizens and public 1.
It contemplates the leasing of public
grazing lands by the General Govern
ment, the revenue thus derived to be used

to be expended by State engineering bod
ies; the Federal Government to aid In the
storage of flood waters by yearly appro-
Eriatlons in the river and harbor bill; the
tate to assume such control O f the pub
lic lands as may be delegated to it by the
Federal Government and expend the rev
enues under the direction of a State en
gineer to be provided Ipv law. supplement
ing the moneys received from the Federal
Government by such moneys as shall be
provided.
Robert P. Troy offered the following:
Resolved. That the interests of irri
gation can best be subserved by tho
early extensive construction of "water
Btorage reservoirs, and any project
looking to that end, whether promoted
by national. State or individual aid or
combination of these elements, should
be encouraged and fostered by the
people.
Former Surveyor General Will S. Oreon
the "father of irrigation in California,"'
then offered a resolution embodying tho
following provisions, with others supple
mental for their execution:

Resolved. That there shall be created
a State board of irrigation, composed
of three members, one of whom must
be a civil engineer of experience in
irrigation works, who shall receive a
llxed annual .salary; the others to re
ceive a per diem compensation, with
a fixed maximum; and said board shall
exercise powers and perform duties as
follows: i a) It shall examine the ir
rigable lands adjacent to all streams
in the State where irrigation is
practiced or will probably in the
near future be practiced, and
shall determine what lauds may
be irrigated from a stream and
what lands are e.ntitled to the use
of the waters of such stream, and
shall make a description of the district
thus laid out. to be called the "water
district of " (naming the stream),
and shaJl file a description by metes
and bounds, together with a "map of

cacy of his resolution, and, giving the
history of Irrigation conventions In the
State, said that his resolution was the
substance of a bill authorized in the Riv
erside and Fresno irrigation conventions,
which had been defeated In the Senate
by the Ut-e of money.
"There is no law in the State now," he
exclaimed, "but the shotgun for the ap
propriation of water out of a stream. In
the evolution of the law on waters in
California we have got as far as the shot
gun. Now we must gtt to some other
method."
Mr. Cosper called for an explanation of
the plan submitted by Adams of Santa
Cruz, and that gentleman went on at con
siderable length to elaborate his idea*. As
a matter of mere self-interest the more
humid parts of the State could afford to
help to irrigate the more arid regions. The
Slate, he said, would never have its high
est development and greatest prosperity
until the arid lands were irrigated ami
provision was made to store waters for
use in dry seasons.
H. Weinstock of Sacramento introduced
a resolution that it was the sense of the
convention that every effort should be
made to secure both Federal and State
aid In dealing with the flood waters of
the State.
Delegate A. J. Plllsbsry. in presenting a
decidedly important resolution, said he
was in favor of everything in sight, but
while he was in favor of national aid and
State conservation he impressed upon the
delegates that they could not afford to
lose courage to push forward individual
and private enterprise, as has been done
heretofore. His resolution was as fol
lows:
Whereas, The distribution of the un
impounded waters of the streams of
California has heretofore been attend
ed by extensive litigation from con
flicting claims so that some localities
have expended more money in litiga
tion than in the construction of needed
irrigation works; and whereas, the
Immediate expansion of the irrigated
area in California can best be achieved
by securing a more e^rtain knowledge
or' existing water rights and the more
equitable, distribution of the free flow
of the streams In < xcess of such ex
isting rights, and pending the formu
lation of a system or systems of water
conservation,
Resolved, That this convention de
clares in favor of such legislation as
will require all persons and corpora
tions using for irrigation any part of
the water of any stream in California
to within a reasonable time and before
a tribunal provided by law for hearing
and determining such controversies
make proof of their claims to use such
water, to the end that all rights to
water may be made matter of definite
record, alter which a statute of lim
itations shall preclude the possibility
of again putting such rights Into
jeopardy and the residuary waters
may tie made available for the further
expansion of the irrigated area under
such conditions as the law may im
pose.
R. T. Devlin of Sacramento introduced a
resolution requesting the Governor of the
State to take steps to keep in proper re
pair the State easement at Elkhorn and
the jetties at Newtown shoals. He also
spoke on it. â  general question.
P. A. Buell of Stockton submitted a res
olution that California should take the
initiative in the storage of the Hood wa
ters and the convention should act ac
cordingly.
George H. Maxwell, one of Sonoma's
delegates, a representative also of the
National Irrigation Congress, and recog
nized as the head and front of opposition
to the proposition to issue bonds for im
pounding the flood waters of the State,
then mounted the platform. The conven
tion listened eagerly to his remarks. He
said :
As I understood the call under which
this convention has comÂ« together, it
Is to formulate a plan for two. things:
First, for the storage of the flood wa
ters of California; second, for the dis
tribution of these flood waters. For
my own part, beiore I read the resolu
tions I have to offer, I want to say I
â¢ most heartily indorse what has been
said by Mr. Adams and Mr. Pillsbury
with reference to this movement. I
believe that tne great State of Califor
nia, with the co-operation of tne Fed
eral Government, within well-estab
lished constitutional lines, can solve
every question that is before the peo
ple to-day which comes within the
purpose and object of the call of this
convention, but I believe that you can
not solve it and that you never will
solve it until the people of this great
State come together and harmonize
and absolutely unite as one man upon
whatever policy we undertake to carry
out. Now, that being so. it seems to
me that it. would be a grievous mis
take for this convention to undertake
to force through this body any reso
lution, any policy, anything which is
contrary to the firm and strong con
victions of a large minority of the con
vention. In other words, if there are
things we can agree upon, let us de
clare for them; if there are things we
do not agree upon, let us wait and see
if we cannot get together before we air
our quarrels.
The plan I propose to present to you
now is the plan of the National Irri
gation Congress for solving the prob
lem that confronts you. and one that
will solve this problem within a time
shorter than any one would deem pos
sible. The shibboleth we have gone
under is "irrigation without debt,"
portance than the proverbial thirty
coppers. There is a possibility that
one of these may strike mother earth,
but the astronomers say that we are
in no great danger of her being all
broke up over the contact. San Fran
ciscans who Intend to take in the show
should keep their eyes fixed on the
skios In the direction of Oakland and
Alameda. Most of the peculiar things
that happen originate over that way.
The electric lights there are turned off
early and there will be no danger of
mistaking them for the real thing.
