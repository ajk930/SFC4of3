Mrs. Phebe Hearst's
Splendid Prize Has
Been Awarded.
Four American Architects Divide
the Remaining Honors of Comp

THE International contest for th<
Phebe Hearst architectural plar
for the University of California
has ended. A'fr a competltloi
in which the leading arch 11 ot

of the greatest Ilvirifr architects no
where in the world is there such ar

for TVi Ut-iey. It remains now to deter

archi'trct's dnÂ»am a reality. Bat the
gigantic arid dazzling project has be
gun ar.d its promoters say that millions
of dollar^ are already promised for its
accomplishment! The pian is nothing
Jess thtin stupendous.. It involves the
removal of every building on the uni
versity grounds ar.u the creation of a
new city of learning which will stretch
fmm the top of Grizzly Peak down the
heights and past the present campus.
Provision Is made for every con
ceivable department of learning from
a theater to a gymnasium, and in the
bewildering prospect the thought of
beauty has prevailed. There is not In
the world euch another university. In
beauty of location, adaptability of
buildings to their uses, in grouping and
in artistic effects the design of the
French master presents a picture that
hr.r no counterpart.
This result, which may give to Cali
fornia an everlasting monument, is the
work of Mrs. PI â  â â â  Hearst. It was sho
who inaugurated he contest and now
pledges a princely fortune to achieve
a substantial result. It was Mrs.
Hearst who brought the master archi
tects at the world into Eh< sternest" of
competitions and one that was without
parallel. The victor in yesterday's
award may say that twice ho met the
lead architects of all countries and
twice he won. More than this, the re
gents of the University of California,
to whom the plan will be submitted,
r.ir say that they have before them the
best that the civilized world can pro
duce in architecture.
As already described the plan to se
cure an Ideal university for Berkeley
was without parallel. Mrs. Hearst be
gan it early two years ago Large
sums of money were expended in pre
liminary work. Experts were sent to
Europe to -study different universities
and to invite interest In the new and
gigantic project. Pamphlets were cir
culated in the Uuited States and sent
BENARD DESIGN FOR THE NEW/ UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.
The San Francisco Call.
to Germany, England. France and
Italy, and eminent architects were in
vited to compete in designing a perfect
university for Berkeley.
The missionary work was well done.
The leading architects of the world en
tered the field, for the prize of money
was worth the winning and the pros
pect of new honors worth the trial.
Ninety-eight eminent architects sub
mitted signs, which on September 30.
IS9S, were submitted to a jury at Ant
werp. This jury, competent to judge,
worked by elimination and after the
first trial only forty-four designs re
mained. Fifty-four had been rejected,
so searching and exacting had been the
standard of. excellence.
After the second trial only twenty
one designs remained as eligible.
Then there was a third examina
tion and only the creations of eleven
architects escaped the fire. It was re
markable that all of 'these designs' re
ceived the unanimous approval of the
jury. These eleven plans were brought
to this city and it Is from them that the
jury has drawn thai of Benard as the
best. His victory has been well won.
His v, irk. under the fire of every pos
sible criticism, should be the best that
the world can give. It Is a signal tri
umph for French architecture.
Benard's design being adjudged the
finest of. the eleven in the final contest
was awarded the first prize of $10,000.
All the other prize winners are Ameri
cans, although graduates of the French
school of architecture. They are:
Howeris. Stokes .v Ilornbostel. New
York, second, $4000; Despardelles &
Stephen Codman, Boston, third, $3000;
Howard & Cauldwell, New York,
fourth, $2000; Lord. Hewlett & Hull,
New York, fifth. $1000.
The jury has not yet completed its
report of the work, but this will be
finished to-day or to-morrow and will
be filed Â» with, the_^ university regents,
bffore if i? made public.
The report will discuss at great
length the merits, demerits, faults and
fine points of all the plans submitted.
The outcome of the contest is looked
upon as a decided triumph for the
French school of art. No fault is found
with the jury's award. The members
worked conscientiously and were not
swayed in their judgment by partiality
or bias. As a matter of fact even if
they were inclined that way there was
no opportunity for unfairness in mak
ing the â¢ awards. None of the plans
bore the names of the designers and
the coats of arms were covered and
sealed and were not exposed Until the
jury had reached its final decision.
Many things were taken into consid
eration in making .the decision â the
grouping of the different buildings, the
SAX FRAIS CISCO, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1899.
MONSIEUR E. BENARD, THE WINNNER.
Monsleur Benard, whose plans for the new Stai.- University were awarded the first prize by the jury of archi
tects, was born ai Goderville, Department of the Lower Seine, France, in 1844. He is a diplomat Eeole de Beaux Arts
and holder of the Grand Prix de Rome. He Ins been piominently identified with some of the greatest modern archi
tectural undertakings of France.

to the present university site.
The Benard plans present marvelous

nentioned. They are foi a series 01
itrucfures commencftig weÃt of thÂ»
â¢resent campus and extending to th<
limit of the university property and far
up f> the summit of Grizzly Peak,
where the proposed observatory euild
lng is to be located.
A /Magnificent City of
Learning Is Finally
Designed.
Millions of Dollars and Years of
Time yv\*jst Be Given to Make a
Brilliant Dream a Reality.
In making his designs Eenard has
utilized to the very best advantage the
grounds as they are; that is. he has
preserved the contour of the property
:as much as possible. The jury consid
! ered that a decidedly favorable .
jas the excavations proposed in some
i of the plans would have been extreme
ly expensive and would have destroyed
many of the beauties of the surround
ings. Even the oak trees and! the lit
tle streams in the iniversity grounda
have been taken Into consideration by j
Mr. Benard, and his buildings ai
arranged that none of them will b
turbed. In the main the sty!.- of archi
tecture adopted is modern, but oat
terned after the classics. Mr. Benard
was inspired by and followed closely
upon classic lines. He has leaned
somewhat to the Roman lonic order.
Opening off University avenue is the
great court, which the architect des
ignates the Fin>- Arts Square. Around
this he has grouped the educational
buildings, strictly speaking. To the
south are the theaters, two in number,
and structures of imposing design.
East of the Fine Arts Square at the
end of an avenue upon which face the
ancient and modern history. English,
the library, the administration buildin-r
and the department of jurisprudence, is
the athletic field, backed up by the ath
letic hall and gymnasium. At the
sides of the athletic court are the
tribunes, and the gymnasium is a most
beautiful structure. North of th? ath
letic building and east is the military
department. These buildings are so lo
cated that crowds can pass to and from
the athletic section without going
through the main grounds.
Up on the rising ground toward Griz
zly Peak are located the natural his
tory group â the -departments of zoo
logy, botany and similar branches. A
museum of zoology is included in the
group. The observatory i : located at
the top of Grizzly Pef>k and is a prom
inent feature of the plans.
Down in the park where the hot
houses now stand the architect has
placed a number of smal' dwellings,
presumably for the use of members of
the faculty. A 1 the other extreme of
the grounds, remote from all other
buildings, is the infirmary. The dormi
tories are situated on the hillside and
the club houses are west of the athletic
field.
It was the spacious opening court
and the general laying out of the plan
that won it favor with the jury. The
arrangement of the buildings on the hill
was not considered quite perfection or
in any comparison with the lower
groups, hut the excellence of the latter
overbalanced whatever deficiencies
I there were in the balance of the gen
PRICE FIVE CE^TS.
FRENCH GENIUS WINS J
eral plan and prompted the Jury to
award Mr. Benard's designs the first
prize.
The architect has not lost sight of the
educational features of the university
in making his plans. The gymnasium,
military department, dormitories, club
houses, etc., have been made secondary
features to the main educational build
ings. They are finely grouped, with
plenty of provision made for expansion.
While ;the dormitories are separated
somewhat from the main groups they
are conveniently located to both the
athletic field, the gymnasium and the
classical departments.
Mr. Benard'a plans, aside from their
merit as architectural designs, are
works of art. They are all wash draw
ings most artistically executed. As ,to
the detail of the buildings, that is a
matter of after consideration. The
plans are drawn to represent stone, and*
more than likely that is the material
that will be used in their construction.
The cost of the buildings has not been
computed, but when it is taken Into
consideration that the plans call fop
from fifty to seventy-five structures,
many of which are more imposing than
any building in this city, a fair idea,
may be formed of the outlay necessary,
to construct the new university.
Howells, Stokes & Hornbostel. whose
designs won second place, worked on
an entirely different idea from Mr. Bt-Â»
nard. They gave prominence to thÂ»
dormitory. features of their plans, ,-:iv%
ing these buildings bo much space that
the educational departments were sad*.
ly crowded. The classical buildings
are placed on the plateau at the foot
of the hill. The athletic section is Drac*
tically placed the same as in the Be*
nard plan, although they have treated
in it the amphitheater form. The arÂ«
rangement of the grounds provides fo9
two main entrances; one from Univex>Â«
sity avenue and the other from Tele
graph avenue, the main thorouglriard
leading from Oakland. Mr. Howells of!
this firm is son of William Dean How*
ells, the novelist.
Despardelles & Codman, who cams
third in the contest, went outside of
the limits of the university territory.
They planned a university on a seal*
of .grandeur that is almost appalling.
Great tracts of land on both sides oC
the present site are taken in and coy-Â«
en 1 with buildings of gigantic propor
tions. The fault the jurors found with
these designs was that in carrying out
a very artistic idea the architects
divided the university by a wide pub-,
lie boulevard, extending in . a semi-Â«
circle from the end of University
avenue to Telegraph avenue. This
practically cut in twain the groups oC
buildings. The athletic section is given2
DEAL FOR COLUMBIA
CANNERIES IS CLOSED
New York Syndicate Soon to Control the
Entire Salmon Output of
the District
f) VANCOUVER, B. C. Sept. 7. â The deal is now practically com- â¬
) pleted whereby a New York syndicate, organized by T. B. McGovern & /
' Co.. a large brokerage firm, will become proprietors of the whole of the
> salmon :anning industry of British Colui bia. A telegram was received '
to day f:-o::i New York by the Vancouver representative of McGovern v

stock â¢ . and now all that remained was to secure reasonable
â Â¥ price? â  canners.
There are sixty-eight canneries In British Columbiaâ on the Fraser Â£
+ and Skeena rivers m >stly and they are valued at $40.000 each. The ma- j)

.
unusual space and is located almost in
the center of the grounds.
The fourth prize was awarded to
Howard & Cauldwell of Sew York. The
trouble with their plans was a mon
otonous similarity of design in all the
buildings. This was one of the princi
pal faults. The arrangement of the
buildings is excellent and due con
sideration has been given to preserv
ing the contour of the present site.
The last on the list of prize winners
is the firm of Lord. Hewlett & Hull of
New York. A feature of their plans,
and the one which practically won the
fifth prize, is the arrangement of two
beautiful entrances to the university
grounds, one directly from Berkeley
toward the west, and the other facing
toward Oakland opposite Telegraph
avenue. These entrances ad to an
immense square, around which the im
portant buildings are located, connect
ed by colonnades But the designers fell
into the monotonous feature and made
all th. buildings alike. The jury has
considered in looking over all the dif
ferent plans that each building should
be designed to show as far as possible
the us to which it was to be put.
The Hearst architectural contest
marks practically the ginning of one
of the most gigantic undertakings ever
attempted. The consummation of the
plans means that the California Uni
versity will become one of the greatest
and most extensive centers of learning
that the world has ever known. Vir
tually a city will be built on the site of
the present frame buildings that com
prise the State University- city of
buildings that can safely be said to be
the very perfection of architectural de
sign and beauty, the creations of the
greatest architects known. The present
university buildings can almost be
numbered on the fingers of the hands.
The plans which wen the prize in the
architectural contest embrace struct
ures reaching close up to a hundred in
number. Every conceivable depart
ment is provided for according to its
acknowledged importance.
From an architectural standpoint the
contest i.Â« considered one of the most
Important events in the history of the
profession. The eyes of the civilized
world have been turned toward the Jury
of architects and their decision has
been awaited with feverish Impatience.
At this time it is hard to state with
any degree of pi sitlveness what the
next step will be toward a realization
of Mrs. Hearst's plans for California's
university. The report of the jury will
be in the hands of the Regents in a
very few days and then the course for
the immediate future will be outlined.
Mrs. Hearst has guaranteed to provide
for the construction of at least two pf
the most important buildings and other
public spirited people have signified
their Intention of doing likewise.
Monsieur E. Benard, upon whose
plans was conferred the great honor
of being selected as the designs for Cal
ifornia's new university, Is a native of
France and comparatively a young
man. " was born in 1844 at Gader
ville. Department of the Lower Seine.
He has been closely identified with
many of the more important of modern
public "and private architectural works
of France. He is. a diplomat Kcole dc
Beaux Arts, and in August. 1867. he re
ceived the Grand Prix tie Rome, the
highest honor in the line of the arts
that can be conferred in the Old World.
It is conferred in the several depart
ments of painting, architecture, sculp
ture and engraving. M; Benard won
it on an architectural} design for a fine
arts building. The central motive, of
the Art Palace at the Columbian Ex
position at Chicago was radically a
direct copy of the work.
A man only has until he is thirty to
win the Grand Prix. Out of a larere
number of applicants in each depart
ment, ten are selected to. enter the final
competition, and but one of these Is
awarded the* Grand Prix in each year.
Monsieur Benard has done a great
deal of work upon buildings in the
French capital. He designed the Palace
de Compiegne, Civil Court building at
Fecant, the Chateaux of Sassetot and
Mere-aux-Clercs. One of his greatest
pieces of work was the designing cf the
decorations of the Casino de Nice.

The elite of San Francisco society
thronged the ferry building lost evening
to view the plans for California" a univer
sity, which had been submitted by Dearly
a score of world famous artists in compe
tition for the prize offered by Mrs. Phebe
Hearst. It was not a public exhibition:
that will conic later, but the guests were
nil there by invitation of Mrs. Hears)
The drawl mbs had been arranged along
the sides of the east nave of the big
building and an added artistic effect was>
produced by the draptngs of Persian and
Turkish rugs. On the east side, at about
the center of the building, a canopy of
these rugs haxl been erected, under which
Mrs Hearst received her guests, assisted
by Mrs. W. K. Jones of Berkeley, Mrs;
Kd ward. Clark of New York, Mrs. San-
Dorn, Mrs. McDonald, Mrs.- Carriers, Miss
Appcrpon and Miss Lane.
At the north end of the grand nave coat
and cloak rooms had been partitioned off

musk! throughout the evening.

ihe next three hours the guests passed to

fainting spell. Restoratives were quickly
applied ar.d p'hp recovered" almost iram a

due to the somewhat vitiated atmosphere
and the severe nervous strain under
which she has been laboring for the pas!

FRIDAY RESIGNS
HIS POSITION
Leon Dennery Seeks
Other Pastures.
ED B. CARROLL GETS THE JOB
HEALTH BOARD WOULD NOT
STAND THE STRAIN.
Â»
Was Willing to Abide by the Rail
road's Dictation, but Dennery as
Secretary Was One Too
â¢ â¢ Many.
The by no moans delicate stomach of
the San Francisco Board of Health has
finally rebelled at Leon Dennery. That
political creation of Daniel M. Burns of
fered his resignation ass secretary of the
board yesterday. It will bo accepted at
the next meeting. Edward B. Carroll, for
merly statistician to the board, has been
appointed to the vacancy created by Mr.
Dennery 1 enforced resignation.
The resignation of DennerC* was fore
casted some weeks ago in The Call, as
was tin- successor of Carroll. Since hiÂ»
appointment upon Burns' orders individ
ual members of the Board of Health have
made no secret of their dissatisfaction.
No matter what their political debts to
Burns might be, or his to them, they
have never been willing to stand for Den
nery as a prominent ami unprofitable
member of their political association. His
private and public reputation has been
.such that even Burns has found him a
position where he will have more time
for his politics and bo less open to public
criticism and censure. Mr. Dennery, it
is understood, will after the loth of the
month be employed as district deputy to
Internal Revenue inspector Lynch. In
that position he will have the same sal
ary and less work; his time for the good
of the cause will be extended.
"When I took this job." said Mr. Den
nery yesterday, "I never expected to keep
it. I was under fire from the newspapers
and about everybody else, and I accepted
for that reason. Now I can retire with
a clean record and no paper in town can
say I have done anything crooked. I
won't say what Job I'm going into next,
but I am needed more downtown, where
there's something doing, than I am here,
and -I'll Just hand this out to you for a
tip: I'll have more time and more people
where I'm going."
Despite his assertion that his resigna
tion was voluntary. It is known that the
members of the board informed Burns
weeks ago that the course Dennery has
taken must eventuate In his retirement.
They were willing to take orders so long
as their individual reputations did not
suffer by association, but to no further
extent. That they were still willing to
bow down to the Burns-Herrih political
corporation is evidenced by the fact that
Edward Carroll, brother-in-law of George
Crocker, vice president of the Southern
Pacific, has been appointed to Dennery's
phace, hut their subserviency in that case
finds extenuation in the fact that Carroll
is a competent man and one against whom
nothing discreditable can be said, either
personally or politically.

COL. SHAW CHOSEN
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
Close of the Thirty-Third National Encamp
ment of the Grand Army of the
Republic.
COLONEL ALBERT D. SHAW OF NEW YORK.
This well-known veteran has been elected commander In chief of the
Grand Army of the Republic. In 1597 he was chosen department commander
of New York.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. ". â The
thirty-third national encampment
of the Grand Army of the Re
public came to an end to-night.
The election of a commander-in
chief. which it was supposed would be
settled only after a warm contest, was
conducted and carried out in the most
peaceable manner Imaginable. Colonel
Albert D. Shaw of "Watertown, N. V.,
was unanimously elected to the highest
office of the organization, after Judge
Leo Rassieu or St. Louis had declined
to be a candidate. Other officers elected
were: Irvine Robbins of Indianapolis,
senior vice commander-in-chlef ; H. M.
Minton of Louisville, Ky., junior vice
commander; William H. Baker of
Lynn. Mass.. surgeon general; Jacob
H. Grimm of Maryland, char>lain-in
chief.
Early in the campaign there were
three candidates for commander-in
chief. W. C. Johnson- of Cincinnati,
who was acting commander-in-chief,
was first mentioned, and the names of
Colonel Shaw and Judge Rassieur
later became prominent. Johnson's
boom was ended yesterday with his
election to the office for the unexpired
term of the late commander. Sexton,
lasting two days. This rendered him
Ineligible to candidacy for another
term, and with the election of Colonel
Shaw he becomes a past commander
in-ohief.
Aside from the selection of a com
mander-in-chief the pension question
received the major portion of attention.
Resolutions were adopted that rule 2^5,
now in practice, was a hardship in that
it required proof of identity and injury,
which many soldiers could not fur
nish and asking that the President
re-establish rule 164, which is not so
.stringent in its requirements. The
resolutions also deplored the practice in
the pension bureau which bars widows
who have an income of 5% a year, and
asks that the limitation be increased
to $250 a year.
Pursuan'. of the resolutions a com
mittee <>f five was appointed to seek
relief from the administrative officers.
and, failing there, to ask Congress to
amend the law in favor of the veterans.
Chicago secpred the next encamp
ment and it is expected that Judge
Rassieur will then be elected corhman
der-in-chief.
The features of to-days celebration
wore the illumination of the North
Atlantic squadron and the camp fire of
the Union ex-prisoners of war, both of
which occurred to-night. The lighting
up of ihe fleet drew large crowds to
both the Pennsylvania and New Jersey
shores of the Delaware River. The
ships were literally covered with elec
tric lights and presented a magnificent
i picture. The big searchlights on the
vessels were also In operation, making
the illumination more effective. The
cruiser Detroit received considerable
attention from the crowd by reason of
the order sending her to Venezuela to
I protect American interests there.
The Academy of Music was crowded
to the door? to-night by Grand Army
men and their friends to take part in
the ex-prisoners' campflre. Addresses
were made by Governor Stone of Penn
sylvania. Mayor Ashbridge of this city,
ex-Governor Robert E. Pattison. Lieu
tenant Colonel James B. Barnett of the
Tenth Pennsylvania Regiment; General
John C. Black of Illinois. United States
Senator Penrose' and a number of
others.
There were numerous reunions held,
and the Illumination of the "Avenue of
Fame" and the fireworks display at
Camp James A. Sexton were continued
to-night.
Rear Admiral Sampson attended the
convention of Naval Veterans of the
United States. The delegates discussed
a plan for the erection of a monument
to the memory of Past Rear Admiral
J H. Dahlgren. A committee was ap
pointed to solicit subscriptions for the
memorial. Officers were elected as fol
lows:
Commodore commanding. Goerge I.
Seavy, Chicago; fleet captain and chief
of staff, I. B Baker. Boston: command
er, J. A. Miller. Athens, Ohio: lieuten
ant commander. J. O. Shaw. Maine:

U. P. Dustln, Rhode Island: chaplain.
A. S. McWilllams. Detroit; judge advo
cate. C. F. Cooding. Chicago.
The convention adjourned to meet
with the G. A. R. at Chicago in 1900.
SONS MAY SEPARATE
FROM THE VETERANS
DETROIT. Sept. 7.â Whether there is
really any friction between the Sons of
Veterans and the G. A. R., and whether
the two societies shall In the future camp
together, are the serious questions being
considered by the eighteenth annunl en
canjpment Ot the Sons of Veterans, which
began here this afternoon. Opinion among
the delegates on the matter of campling
together with the veterans of the G. A.
R. is divided.
There is in the hands of the resolution
committee a resolution fixing the 1900 en
campment at Chicago simultaneously
with the G. A. li. and ordering that the
sons camp with the veterans hereafter.
It will be reported to the delegates for
consideration to-morrow. Both Syracuse,
N. V.. and Milwaukee arc also working
fur the next encampment, with Milwau
kee In the lead to-night.
Three candidates for the office of com
mander in chief, to succeed F. L. Shep.irt
of Chicago, have developed. A. W*. Jones
of Youngstown. Ohio, is the lea-ding can
didate, with NcwtQii J. McGuire of In
dianapolis and Rev. YV. J Pat ton of
Marinette. Wis., also working for the
office.
The military feature qf the order seems
to be on the wane. There is a desire
among the delegates to eliminate the
drills and military sections and make of
the order a patriotic society of a purely
civil character, aside from the officers
retaining their present military titles.
About 200 delegates are attending the en
camptnent and visitors swell the total
attendance to the vicinity of 400.
The Ladles' Aid Society is meeting at
the Hf.te! Cadillac, with forty delegates
present. The secretary, Mrs. Mamie P
Dorsey, reported a total membership' of
4ii9. divided among 19.3 societies.

Most Warlike Debate in the First Raad in
Which President Kruger Takes a
Prominent Part.
NEWCASTLE, NATAL. SOUTH AFRICA.
This town Is situated on the banks of the Vaal River, the boundary line between Natal and the Transvaal. Here
Is located the only bridge crossing the Vaal, and It is considered a place of much strategical importance. Newcastle
is probably thp first point the Boers will attack Ln case of war. The picture is from a sketch made several years
sinca by J. Harrington, the artist, of this city.
LONDON, Sept. B.â special dis
patch to the Morning Post from
Pletermaritzburg says that the
800 Boers who left Pretoria for
Standerton, about fifty miles
from the frontier, pushed on to Vols
rust, close to the Natal border, where
they are now encamped.
The same correspondent says that the
arrangements for the defense of New
castle, in Natal, south of Laings Neck,
are now practically complete. He adds:
"The Governor of Natal informs me
that the Boers of Utrecht and Vryheid
have been suddenly recalled to the high
veldt. They were compelled to leave
their cattle behind them, but they took
children of the natives as hostages."
The Times, commenting editorially
upon the Transvaal's demand for an
explanation of the presence of British
troops on the border, says: "Such a
demand as the Transvaal has addressed
to its suzerain is probably without pre
cedent, except as an act of defiance.
Ignorant of diplomatic usages as the
Boers may be, thny could hardly have
taken this step unless they wished to
dare us to a trial of strength. If the
Transvaal now withdraws from an un- I
tenable position the future cannot be j
mined on the same terms as were
proposed at the Bloemfontein confer
ence. The Government would now be
Justified in annulling its previous of
fers."
DEBATING BOERS
DEFY GREAT BRITAIN
PRETORIA. Sept. 7.â There was
great excitement in the First Raad to
day on Mr. Coetzer's interpellation of
the Government regarding the presence
of British troops on the borders and the
stoppage of ammunition consigned to
the Transvaal.
President Kruger, the members of the
Executive Council and most of the prin
cipal officials were present, together
with a large representation- of the gen
eral public, including many ladies.
At the outset the chairman and
President urged the members to pre
serve calmness and to avoid insulting
language.
The Swite Secretary, F. W. Reltz,
paid he had called the previous day on
the British diplomatic agent, Conyng
ham Greene, and had asked him what
reply the Government would give in
th/> Volksraad regarding the alleged
massing of British troops on the bor
ders, and whether Mr. Green would
communicate with the British High

Commissioner, Sir Alfred Milner. The
reply from Mr. Greene, ho continued,
had been received this morning and
i was In the following terms:
Dear Mr. Reitz: The following if Sir
Alfred Milner's reply to the telegram
which I Bent him at your request:
"J dc. not know to what Mr. Kpitz re
fprs when be alludes to the massing of
troops. This must be the British troops
in South Africa, the position and numbers
of which are no secret, but it is a matter
of i ommon knowledge that they are here
In order to protect British Interests and to
â  make provision against eventualities."
Mr. Coetzer and other members then
made violent speeches, declaring that
they could not understand Sir Alfred
Milner's reply since the Transvaal had
I never threatened the English colonies.
"It is time," exclaimed Mr. Coetzer,
: "for the Transvaal also to prepare for
i eventualities."
One member said: "England's action
! is like putting a revolver in a man's
i face."
Another concluded a warlike ha
rangue in this strain: "It is time to
send our burghers to the borders to ask
these troops what they want. The fire
is bound to start. So let them light it
i and allow it to burn out quickly. War
| is better than the present state of af
i fairs. Business is ruined and the pub-
I lie treasury Is drying up. Chamber
: lain is trying to ruin the country."
These speeches and others attacking
| Cecil Rhodes were loudly applauded by
the house and by the public.
The debate continued throughout the
afternoon.
Mr. Tosen, who declared that Sir
Alfred Milner's reply was tantamount
to a declaration of war, read a telegram
from the field cornet of the Pietreitlef
district stating that the people there
would rise in rebellion if President
Kruger went to another conference.
The chairman called Mr. Tosen to or
d<=-r for saying that the Jameson raid
ers ought to have been hanged.
J. M. M. "Walmarans, one of the non
official members of the Executive Coun
cil, counseled prudence and caution. He
said It would be wise for the Raad to
decide whether the republic should con
cede further negotiation or not.
In the course of the debate Mr. Dutolt
insinuated that Mr. Chamberlain was
intoxicated on the occasion of his re
cent famous "garden party speech" at
Highbury, his Birmingham residence,
and he added that if Mr. Chamberlain
continued to act as he had been actinc
the Transvaal would give him "Mauser
pi Pp." which would be a good purga
tive. He urged the house not to bÂ«
frightened by the show of sending out
British troops, remarking that Mr.
Chamberlain must remember that
when a war had once started he would
have to fight the whole of Afrikander
dom.
The chairman remonstrated with Mr.
Dutoit. observing that he thought the
members had gone too far.
Mr. Toscn ask^d whether the Gov
ernment considered Pir Alfred Milner's
telegram a declaration of war.
Mr. Wolmarans replied that person
ally he did not think so, adding that
the telegram was a? inexplicable to the
Executive as to the Raad.
Sutisfquently Mr. Woimarans told
the Chamber that President SU>yn of
thf> Orange Free State has said that
Portugal must be called to account for
stopping the passage of ammunition.
President Kruger, who was greeted
with loud cheers, began his speech by
paying that might was not right, but
thut right was might and he knew the
Lord ruled and was righteous and
would give a good judgment.
President Kruger Bald: "The aliens
have been offered equal rights with the
l.urghers, but have refused them. Mr.
Chamberlain is striving to get the
franchise, which tho outlanders do not
want, but what he really desires is
possession of the Transvaal. The
burghers are willing to concede much ;
for the sake of peace, but will never
sacrifice thoir Independence."
After eulogizing Mr. Gladstone's ac
tion nf retrocession in 1881 as a noble
deed, President Kruger said that if it
now came to fighting the Almighty
would be the arbiter. He urged the
members of the Raad to show modera- |
tinn, reminding them that the reply
from Mr. Chamberlain was en route,
and pointing out that if the proposal
for a commission were agreed to, the
republic would send delegates to
further discuss matters, and, if possi
ble, to make peace.
The speeches following the Presi
dent's were more moderate in tone and
the Raad rose without passing any
resolution.

FORCE FOR SERVICE
IN SOUTH AFRICA
ALDERSHOT, England. Sept. 7.â
The Aldershot News issues what it
claims to be an authoritative state
ment of the composition of the home
force for service in South Africa in the
event of war. This force consists of
two cavalry brigades and six infantry
brigades, the latter including four bat
talions of the guards and one Irish and
one Highland brigade. All the troops
indicated are not at or near Aldershot.
The force would have a national char
acter and would mobilize here under
the command of Sir Redvers Buller
LONDON, Sept. 7.â The Daily Mail

EFFORTS TO INDUCE
EAGAN TO RETIRE
Friends of His Possible Successor
Seeks in Vain to Get the General
Out of the Way.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.â Earnest ef
forts have been made without success to
get Commissary General Eagan to make
application for retirement. General Eagan
Is now a resident of Hawaii, where he
has a large plantation, but Is on a visit
to New York. He was suspended with
full pay until retirement, and his reason
for refusing to apply to go on the retired
list is believed to be the loss of money
he would suffer. Under the law he would
have to retire on three-fourth pay, which
would amount to $4125 per year, instead
of $5500, so that he would lose $6875 in the
five years remaining to him on the active
list.
Friends of Colonel John F. Weston, act
ing commissary general of subsistence,
have been endelavoring to get Eagan's
consent to retirement. I have been told
they have shown their willingness to
make up the amount the former commis
sary general would lose by making formal
application for retirement. General
Eagan has declined, however,-- and from
present indications proposes to block the
way of Colonel Weston. The President
deeply regrets now that he did not take
action before suspending General Eagan.
which would insure an application from
that officer for retirement. As it Is now
Colonel Weston is performing the duties
Og commissary general and receiving pay
and emoluments of a colonel of subsis
tence in the department. In other words
lie is serving General Eagan's sentence.
The President Is helpless, however, and
General Eagan can only be retired when
he reaches the age of 62 years or upon his
own application.

WASHINGTON. Sept. 7. -Official ad

the condition of affairs in Venezuela is not
so disturbing: as the private information
received yesterday indicated.
It Ik stated positively in the message
received to-day that matters looked more
encouraging for the Governn^nt. This,
however, has caused no change in the de
partment's intention to order the Detroit

ADVANCE TO ANGELES
A POLITICAL MOVE
MANILA. Sept. 3 (via Hongkong, Sept.
7).â lt is the general opinion among offi

: due to political pressure in the United i
1 States. They all agree that it was de- i

produced by the newspaper correspond

' There are five miles of unguarded rali- j

â  and the rebels were able to descend upon ;
this and tear it up for three miles. The

DREYFUS' FATE WILL BE

France Taking Extraordinary Precautions to
Prevent Outbreaks After the Verdict of
the Court-Martial Is Announced.
RENNES, Sept. 7.â To-day came ]
the beginning of the end of the
Dreyfus trial. With the speech
of the Government commissary, j
Major Carriere, the case entered !
upon the final stage of pleadings and
the verdict will be delivered on Mon
day. There is even talk to-night of the
trial ending to-morrow by holding an
extra afternoon session for M. Labori's
speech and the deliberation of the
judges. This, however, is considered
unlikely, as the Government is anxious
to have the judgment withheld over
Sunday in order to avert demonstra
tions which would probably involve
bloodshed on a day where the workmen
are free.
The Government Is not only fearful
regarding Rennes, but is particularly
fearful regarding Paris and other large
towns where passions have been heated
and the verdict, whichever way it is
given, is practically certain to give rise
to trouble. It is understood that the
Government has intimated its desire to
the president of the court-martial
Colonel Jouaust, and there is no reason
to believe that he will not fall in with
Its views.
Colonel Jouaust this morning took
the most important decision yet taken
and took it entirely upon his own re
sponsibility, although he is undoubted
ly only the mouthpiece of the whole
body of judges. His decision to ex
clude the testimony of Colonel
Schwarzkoppen and Major Panizzardi
was most significant, as it meant that
the court had already reached a conclu
sion and that the pleadings of counsel
were merely a waste of time and might
be dispensed with if they were not a
necessity-
The court has made up its mind, but
which way? This is the view point and
forms the sole topic of discussion. Both
sides are equally confident that the
court will decide in accordance with
their views.
The Dreyfusards declare that the
judges cannot condemn Captain Drey
fus after rejecting the decisive evidence
which Colonel Schwarzkoppen and
Panizzardi would have given in his
favor.
The anti-Dreyfusards. on the other
hand, explain to-day's rulings on the
ground that the judges recognize that
the evidence of the two military at
taches would be worthless, because
they would be morally bound to save
their agent at any cost.
A sample of this reason was given
by an anti-Dreyfusard journalist, who
when praising Colonel Jouaust's de
cision, explained: "What weight could
he attach to the testimony of Schwarz
koppen and Panizzardi? The receiver
of stolen goods must shield the thief as
much as he can."
From the popular point of view the
scene in court when Colonel Jouaust
delivers the judgment will be divested
of its most sensational feature, owing
to the absence of the central figure.
Captain Dreyfus will be taken to an
adjacent room when the judges retire
to consider their verdict. A moment
before they are to re-enter a bell will
be rung and as they take their places
behind the long table on the stage the
infantry guard will present arms and
remain at present arms while Colonel
Jouaust, standing in the center of the
platform, reads the verdict.
Captain Dreyfus will not be brought
back to the courtroom and will not be
present at the meeting of the judges,
but when the courtroom has been
cleared by the gendarmes, which will be
done as soon as Colonel Jouaust con
cludes, the reading clerk of the court
will proceed to the room where Dreyfus
will be waiting and read to him the
verdict in the presence of a couple of
gendarmes.
The public will thus be robbed of the
spectacle of his emotions, which are
bound to be most profound, whether
the decree sends him to the arms of his
family or back to the penal settlement.
The verdict may be a condemnation,
an unequivocal acquittal or a form of
acquittal that would be equivalent to
the Scotch verdict "not proven." The
last will be the case if the judges
should pronounce against him by a
vote of four to three. That is. he would
be freed, even though the judges in his
favor should be in the minority. But
this, naturally, would be very unsatis
factory, as he would bear the stigma
for the rest of his days.
Captain Dreyfus thus has five
chances against the prosecution's
three. Unanimity, six to one. five to
two, four to three or three to four will
set him at liberty, while unanimity, six
to one or five to two will convict him.
If convicted, the judgment will be car
ried to the military court of appeals.
which will be n formal matter. The
special court will only quash the in
dictment and order a retrial if it should
be established the present court-mar
tial has erred in a matter of procedure.
This is in the highest degree improb
able. The Court of Cassation will have
also the right to order a retrial if it
should decide that the court-martial
has deviated from its instructions.
Thi-s is the only loophole for Dreyfus,
and his friends will undoubtedly fight
this point tooth and nail.
Extraordinary measures have been
taken to spirit Dreyfus away, whether
acquitted or recondemned. His de
parture from Rennes will be enveloped
in the same mystery as was his arrival.
CARRIERE DEMANDS
DREYFUS' CONVICTION
RENN'ES, Sept. 7.â At the opening this
morning of the fourth day of_the fifth
week of the second trial by court-mar
tial of Captain Alfred Dreyfus of the ar
tillery, charged with treason, M. Labori,
leadng counsel for the defense, an
nounced that he had received a semi-offi
cial intimation that Colonel Schwarzkop
pen. the former German military attache
at Paris, and Major Panizzardi, the for
mer Italian military attache at Paris
would be unable to appear personally be
fore the court. Counsel, therefore, pro-
posed that a rogatory commission should
be telegraphed to receive the depositions.
M. Paleologue of the French Foreign Of
fice and Major Carriere did not oppose M.
Labori's application.
After M. Labori had submitted his ap
plication the Chief of Detectives, M.
Cochefort. deposed favorably regarding
the attitude of Dreyfus when Colonel dv
Paty de Clam dictated the bordereau to
him.
The clerk of the court read a letter
from Captain Humbert to the effect that
Dreyfus had expressed a keen desire in
1894 to enter the statistical section of the
office, and saying that he met Dreyfus

maps and documents, and remarked that
he was acting very imprudently.
General Mercier came to the bar and
said that he felt the deposition of Cap
tain Freystaetter was bound to have pro
duced considerable Impression on the
minds of the Judges. He spoke of the at
tacks made on him since the captain had
testified, saying the Dreyfusard press
had been calling him a fake witness, etc.
The general declared that he gave an or
der in 1594 that nothing should be done
with the various translations of the Pan
izzardi dispatch, adding that he himself
was present when the packet of secret
papers for the court-martial was made
up, and it did not contain the Panizzardt
dispatch. He had since questioned the
Judges of the court-martial on the sub
ject, but none of them was prepared to
swear that the dispatch was not sub
mitted to them, because their recollec
tions now were rather vague.
This statement of General Mercier
evoked a chorus of disgusted "Ohs!"
fmm the audience.
The court then retired to deliberate on
M. I^abori's application, and its probable
decision was eagerly discussed. Every
one in court stood up when the Judges re
turned, after deliberating a quarter of an
hour. Colonel Jouaust gave the order.
"Present arms," to the guard of soldiers
at the bottom of the hall, while he, stand

on either side of him. read the announcp
ment that the Judges had unanimously
decided that the president. Colonel Jou
aust. was competent to order a rogatory
commission and that the judges as a b<>c!y.
according to the military code, were not
competent to do so.
M. T,abori thereupon asked Colonel Jou
aust if he still maintained his refusal to
appoint the commission, the colonel hav
ing said, when M. Labori submitted his
conclusions, that he was opposed to the
application.
Colonel Jouaust replied "Yes, and the
evidence of Colonel Schwarzkoppen and

Major Panizzardi with regard to their
relations with Dreyfus was thus excluded.
After the decision of the court refusing

Major Carriere was called upon to de-

j bordereau, though the phrase concerning 1
'â  the convoying of troops was very sig
nificant. He pointed out that Dreyfus
could have obtained the information with
little trouble. Major Carrier? argued that
Esterhazy could not say in August that
he was going to the maneuvers, while
I 'reyfus could have thought so up to Au
j gust 28.
"My belief in the innocence of Dreyfus."
! said Major Carriere in conclusion, "has
i been tiat.pformed into a conviction of his
guilt, which has been strengthened by
the testimony of the witnesses of the
prosecution. " To-day I come to tell
you on my soul and conscience that Drey
fus is puilty and to ask for the application
i of Article 76 of the Penal Code."
All the generals and other officers who
were seated in the witness chairs left the
; courtroom just before the Government
â  commissary closed, in accordance with
â  orders of the Minister of War, General
: Gallifet, to leave Rennes within two hours
> after the pleading had begun. There was
an interesting scene in the courtyard of
the Lycee. where the officers took leave of
' each other. They appeared to be in good
j spirits.
M. Demange, of counsel for defense,
! will probably occupy the whole of to
! morrow in his speech for the defense and
IM. I>abori will speak on Saturday. The
verdict will be rendered Monday "because
! the police are opposed to the announce
! ment of the verdict on Saturday if It
were possible to do so, on the ground that
it would be likely to lead to trouble on
Sunday.
"When Major Carriere had concluded.
Colonel Jouaust ordered the adjournment
I of the court. Dreyfus rose quickly and
apparently not dejected.
As the prisoner was passing counsel's
tahlp M. Labori stopped him and
â  whispered "Courage." Dreyfus smiled
i and nodded and as he proceeded M.
: Jaures. the Socialist leader, and some of
i the others seated on the benches before
; which Dreyfus passed, repeated M. La
bori's word of encouragement.
The most elaborated police measures
will be taken during the last days of the
trial. Eight gendarmes will be distributed
lin the courtroom. Twenty gendarmes and
â¢ a detachment of infantry will be stationed
'in the courtyard, lines of tronps and
gendarmes In the vicinity of the Lycee
will be tripled and placed further back.
; detachments of gendarme? will be posted
on the squares and bridges of the town
â  and mounted gendarmes will patrol the
streets. The garrisons of neighboring
towns will be held in readiness to be dls

; a cry is raised or a threatening gesture
made by any one in the audience before or
; after the verdict the offender will be ar
; rested and taken before the president of
I the court. Colonel Jouaust. and will then
; be sentenced to punishment, the minimum
i penalty being two years in prison.

CHAMBERLAIN
HERE TO COACH
THE "CARDINAL",
The Celebrated , Yale Football
Captain Will Endeavor to Re
verse Last Year's Score.
Burr Chamberlain, the noted captain of
the Yale football team, arrived in this city
yesterday. He comes to coach the Stan
ford University eleven in an effort to wipe
out their defeat of last year by the sturdy
young men of the University of California
team. As there was considerable uncer
tainty as to the time of Chamberlain's
arrival there was no formal reception In
this city, that being reserved for his first
appearance at the university grounds
yesterday afternoon. . â¢
A number of Stanford men went up the
road to meet him. In the party were
Football Manager Berry, Captain Chester
Murphy, ex-Captain Ficnert and ex-Man
ager Switzer, now Corporal Switxer of the
First California Regiment. After a brief
rest in this city the party went to Palo
Alto.
Three hundred students met the new
coach at Palo Alto and followed his car
riage to Bncina Hall, where an impromptu
recption w;u> held. In his remarks to the
students Mr. Chamberlain assured them '
ho "ould do all In his power to reverse |
the football score of last Thanksgiving I
day. and warned them lest they become j
accustomed to defeat. He ha mapped
out no plan of campaign yet.
Captain Murphy, ex-Captain Fickert
and Football Manager Berry were also
called upon for speeches. When Fickert !
expressed hie belief that Chamberlain i
would turn out another "28 to 0" team the
enthusiasm of the students could not be i
restrained.
No active football work will be done
this week, as a few days' rest have been
allowed the coach while the gridiron is
being put in shape. Monday or Tuesday
everything will be in readiness for the |
men to don their suits and commence the
light practice of punting and falling on the
ball. Chamberlain is an ardent golfer and
brought all the implements necessary for '
the game with him.

LATEST EVENTS IN THE WORLD OF SPORT
LOCAL NINE IS
DETERMINED TO
WIN THE SERIES
Practicing Hard to Defeat the
Sacramento' Aggregation.
Gossip of the Players.
Every effort will be made by the San
Francisco team to carry off the coming
series. The men who compose the nine
are imbued with the importance of win
ning and are practicing morning, after
noon and evening In the determination of
heading off Sacramento's winning spurt.
Seven straight defeats at the hands of
the capita! city team has stirred the lo
cals to action. Of the seven victories
achieved by the Sacramento aggregation
a little baseball luck in six of them would
have thrown the game either way, as the
following scores will demonstrate: 2 to 0:
2 to 1, thirteen Innings; 2 to 1; 7 to 6; 3 to 2;
5 to 3, ten innings.

Manager Harris ha? secured Courtney,
"Watsonville's heavy batter, for the local
team. He will take Muller's place in left
field. Muller will not be released, but will
be retained on the team as an extra man.
Brockhoff, another Watsonville player.
now with the local aggregation, will oc
cupy short. t while "Heney" Krug. will
cover the second cushion.
It now comes to light that although the
managers of the San Francisco team were
loth to lose "Tip" O'Nell, they have sur
vived the shod?. "Tip" was looked upon
as being the greatest diamond general In
the league, but he did not live up to his
reputation this season. He was criticized
by the "fans" for his ceaseless but use
less "kicking" during the contests and
also for substituting a ripped ball near
the end of one of the games. According
to one "crank." O'Nell showed by his
loud and frequent "kicks" to the umpire
that he had a meager knowledge of the
rules governing the game. Then again.
"Tip" did not play his position at second
as he might have done. It is a well
known fact that he did not handle a
thrown ball during the entire season, al
lowing Krug to do this important part of
the work. Frequently a left-handed bat
ter would come to the plate, and although
a runner was on the initial bag and the
man at the- bat was notorious for sending
the. ball' along the third base line, the
moment the ball was pitched Krug would
have to rush to second to catch the run
ner, thus leaving his position at the mercy
of the batter. With O'Neil off the team
and the acquisition of Brockhoff and
Courtney, the managers look for great im
provement.
The "Friscos" are anxious to win a ma
jority of games in the next series. The
team will work under a complete system
of signals, and although it will not be ap
parent to the spectators, the effectiveness
of the signals will be.
Babbitt a player who has won fame
in the Canadian League and also in the
Seattle tournament, is likely to play short
for the Beachcombers. Negotiations are
now under way between the management
of the SandcrabÃ and the young man.
Should he accept Clark will be released
and Arrelanea will be a fixture in right
field: When Clark was engaged to play
on the team it was predicted he would
astound the natives, but he did not live
up to his reputation. In fact, as one "fan
puts It, he was a "frost."
Oakland played four games last week
and only made two errors. This fact has
been favorably commented on by the ex
perts as i! Is unprecedented in baseball
for a tall-end am to play such good ball.
Both errors were excusable. The one
made by Bchmeer in Saturday's game was
more an error of judgment. A man was
on first and the ball was batted close to
second. Schmeer secured it. but Instead
of running over to second and then
throwing to first, making a double play,
he threw the sphere into Franks' face.
The error charged to Dunleavy was for
a fly ball, which, carried by the wind, pre
vented it being properly judged. He ran
hard for it from center and managed to
get" his hands on it. but the ball slipped
from his grasp. Had he held it he would
have received an ovation. The other two
games played by the Athenians were
errorless, which bespeaks praise for the
men who compose the aggregation.
Some "fans" are saying that the "Frls
cos" are weak in "twirlers." This con
elusion was evidently reached through
the fact that "Fitz" was touched up for
fifteen hits last week at Sacramento. It
is well known that pitchers in the Na
tional League are batted out of the box
frequently during the season. It was
Fltzpatrick's turn to experience the sen
sation, but as it was the first time this
has happened to him there is no danger
of his being released. With a good team
behind him "Fitz" and Iberg are worthy
to cope with the heaviest batters.
It can be truthfully said that Schmeer
is playing as fast a snort as any National
Leaguer. If his batting was a little
heavier he would be a star in any league.
With Borchers, S'teffanl and Harper the
Oaklands have an effective corps of
pitchers.
Donlln leads off for St. Louis and he is
batting more effectively than any man in
the club with the exception of Burkett.
Pace is playing short for Colusa since
his release from Santa Cruz.
Bad base-running lost Saturday's game
at Sacramento. Idiotic plays on bases by
Pyne, Swindells and Krug did more to de
feat the team than the work of the Sac
ramento pitchers.
INTERCOLLEGIATE FOOTBALL
Game to Be Played at Sixteenth anil
Folsom Streets.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 7.-
The annual Intercollegiate football
game will not be played at Recreation
Park this year. Football Manager Berry
has practically secured the Sixteenth and
FolÃona street grounds. The lease is be
ing prepared and will be rctfdy for the
signatures of the different officers next
week.
This insures better treatment and tet
ter security for the immense crowds that
will visit the Thanksgiving d: v game.
The student associations will let .he con
tracts for furnishing seats for 16.000 peo
ple, and a seat will be reserved for every
ticket sold. City officials will examine
and test the lumber before the gates are
thrown open on the day of the game,
hence perfect security and comfort will
be insured for the patrons of the college
games.

Events on the Track.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 7.â The presence
of William J. Bryan and the tact that it
was Odd Fellows' day as well, attracted
over 4000 people to Agricultural i J ark this
afternoon. The champion ot free silver
delivered a somewhat lengrthy address at
the conclusion of the harness events
was heartily cheered as he left the course.
The weather was warm, the track fast
and the sport above the average. Favor
ites !n the betting wore successful on four
occasions.
In the morning the big stock parade at
tracted a large attendance. The awards
will be made on Saturday.
The 2:40 class trot for 2-year-olds had
but 'hree starters. Before the first heat
it was said that Eulah Me was sick, but
the young Miss stepped off two heats out
in trie lead without half trying. Vendome,
twice second, had speed, but left his leet
several times. The distance flag was
waived, which allowed Dagmar to annex
the .-hurt end of the purse.
Psyche, the chestnut daughter it Cupid.
driven by the old war horse Billy i>"!:a
than. display. -il rare form in the 2:40 class
trotting event, stopping to taw in three
straight heats. For the opening heat El
Moro, Lena A. Eleanor Ann and 4ank
were all well supported, the odds against
Psyche receding from 3 tv
money. Lena A drew the pole, leading the
procession to the stretch, where the t&\ -
orite f'iged to the front, and In a mild
drive led Eleanor Ann past the wire a
couple of lengths. In the two heats fol
lowing Psyche never left the result in
doubt, lta.(iing almost from the word, in
the second heat Eleanor Ann again finish
ing in the place, clinching second money,
but in the third and concluding one was
. up to allow El Moro, the '"selected
one," to land in that position.
The mile and a sixteenth run for mams
and iiliiL-s was boiled down to a three
horse affair. Jennie Reid, with ]iÂ»7 pounds
up. ruled a strong favorite and led from
start to finish, showing marked Improve
iin nt over hei race <>i the day before. The
price against Monrovia was Bllced from
threes to B tc 5, but the old mar.- again
proved a disappointment, being beaten
half a dozen lengths for the place by
Reolia.
1. Morse, who was rulod off the turf
some two years back ft ingleslde trark
for pulling the horse I Don't Know, but
was recently reinstated, rode Hohenxol
lern In the seven furlong run. He made a
ridiculous showing and the race, is open
to much criticism. On Tuesday, with 112
pounds up Hohenzollern galloped six fur
[ongs in 1:15V 4 . To-day Mount McGregor
reeled off the seven furlongs in 1:27%,
t-ased up, from Novia, and I lohenzollern,
a Blight choice over t}n- winner, was
beaten a full dozen lengths. To be suit-,
: acked U. 7 pounds, but this is no ex
cuse for the exhibition.
A big Held of fourteen two-year-olda
sported silk in the last number on the

Hilo ran into the show.
Another large attendance Is looked for
by the management to-morrow. Commer

EXCELLENT
TENNIS AT
DEL MONTE
Wright and Whitman Defeat
Ward and Davis, Champions
of America.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DEL MONTE, Sept. 7.-The guests at
Del Monte have a tennis appetite that
seems tc prow on what It feeds. After
two days of incessant high-class matches
which drew the people in and about the
hotel to the courts the Pacific Coast
championship doubles tournament was
called this morning and a larger crowd
was on hand to stamp approbation than
that which attended the series of matches
between the East and the West. This
tournament is the real thing in tennis
play; first, because it is a tournament and
second, that never before were such high
class teams entered. Whitman and
Wright and Ward and Davis, the latter
pair the champions of America, the Whit
neys and the Hards are all entered and.
the battle of rackets will not be over un
til to-mrrrow night.
One match this afternoon satisfied
all tennis enthusiasts. It "vas be
tween the two Eastern te . an l s -
When it was over the champions or tne
country discovered that there were other
doubles teams a-field and that their
proud unfilled record was bosmudged
with a defeat. Ward and Davis handed
their championship banners over to
Wrig.it and Whitman in a manner indi
cating that defeat had cut deep :nto ihe
spirit cf the losers. Three straight sets
wore all that were required by Whitman
and oia partner, Wright, to destroy the
future hopes of the present champions.
The trouble of it all lies in the fact that
Ward and Davis did not get a start in the
race; Whitman and Wright fairly beat
the Hag and were not even reached when
the race was over. The score reads:
6-: S. 6â2, 6âl.
Davis, the "Clouter," as he has been
dubbed at Del Monte on account of his
merciless smashing of balls, did not play
up to his usual form â¢ yesterday. He
smashed, but the ball went either into the
net or out uf the court, and thereby hangs
the taie of his undoing. Ward, his part
ner, played for the best that was in
him and* his lobbing was perfect. Time
after time he returned the fierce smashes
of Whitman that came at him with crue.
persisterce. Whitman and Wright are a
new team in doubles, but they will p. al
together in the East next season in all
the championship contests. Their victory
to-day was an auspicious beginning to
the doubling up. Young Wright carried
off his section of honors in the match and
has won his spurs.
When the Eastern champions* began
play the courts were crowded and the
light-trousered sports on the bleachers
were betting packages of gum that Ward
and Davis would win in a canter. Even
Walter flobarfs youngest thought so ir
the stamp of approbation means anything.
But after a few minutes the score began
to change. Whitman and Wright won
the first game. Then the champions un
buttoned a bit and took the three follow
ing. Here came the surprise. Without a
word of warning. Whitman and Wright
piled up game after game and the first
! set was soon over. Score. 6â3.
To the scratch the champions came in
the second set with more or less misgiv
ing but they were a trifle fearful of de
feat Again Whitman and Wright ap
propriated the first game, following it
with another. Their opponents succeeded
in securing but two games in this setâ the
sixth and the seventh. When the last
cannon bolt stroke of Davis shot just out
side the back line and Joe Daily an
nounced the result the champions wore
an ultramarine expression. Whitman and
Wright sat on one side of the courts,
Davis and Ward on the other. A rub
down and fearful dissipation in ice water,
and the four Easterners were at It again.
One, two. three, four games went to the
hungry winners. The fifth was for T\ ard
and Davis as was the seventh, the sixth
going to Wright and Whitman. With the
score g_2 and 40 love against them, the
doubles champions bestirred themselves
and made the game deuce. There they
\ stood the next two points being won by
Wright and Whitman, and carrying the
game sot match and likely the cups of
the tournament with it.
To-morrow will be the great day of
doubles, for the Eastern victors will meet
i the Whitneys first and then play the
Hardys for the championship of the coast.
On Saturday there will be single matches
between the Easterners and a special
match between Whitman and Joe Daily.
The other matches in the tournament
were without special Interest. In the game
between Whitman and Wright and Root

he and his partner defaulted. The scores

Slaughtered Immature Calves.
Jesse Mayer was arrested yesterday by
Veterinary Surgeon O'Rourke and In
spector Butterworth in an old house on
the Mission road and two charges placed
against his nameâ one of having imma
ture veal in his possession and the other
of slaughtering cattle outside of tho limits
provided by law. Two calves were con
fiscated which gave every indication of
having been but two or three days old
when they were killed. The calves were
taken to the fertilizing works after first
having been saturated with coal oil.
Judge Conlan held Mayer on $20 bail,
which he immediately produced.

Captain Olsen Exonerated.
Captains O. F. Bolles and J. K. Bulger
have exonerated Captain O. Olsen from all
blame for the striking of the steamer
South Coast on a reef near Hueneme on
July 20 of this year. The captain took
all precautions, such as sounding, etc.,
but the water suddenly shoaled and the
steamer touched the reef. There was a
dense fog at the time. No damage was
done to the vessel.

SHAMROCK NOT
SO FAST IN
LIGHT WINDS
A Trial of the British Boat Shows
That She Does Much Better
Work in a Good Breeze.
Special Di.Â«patch~to The Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 7.â The Shamrock
weighed herself in the balance of light
winds to-day, and was found wanting by
; those who followed the open-sea trial of
! the challenger, a marine sauntering that
was replete with grace and beauty but not
i potential with victory for the stranger
; yacht if light breezes are about when she
and the Columbia meet. In her previous
trials the Shamrock has shown herself to
I be remarkably stiff and speedy when the
winds an 5 brisk and whitecaps are dotting
thf- bine, but in to-day's sleepy seas and
: languid breezes the yacht did not seem to
do so well.
This should not be construed Into mean
ing that the challenger did badly. Wh.it
is meant Is that with the vast sail area
shown she did not fulfill expectations -
did not come up to the promise of extraor
dinary speed in light winds which the
great expanse of canvas gave.
The doings of the day rather com;
a trial of new sails than a test of ep< .
but one goes with the other, and although
there was no way by which the speed
performances of the Shamrock could be
accurately known, the result was a feel
ing that she will stand a better show of
winning in a good, stiff wind than she
will if light breezes are her lot.

MILITARY COMMAND
It Is Said to Be the Intention to
Leave Him in Charge of Civil
Affairs in Philippines.
â¢ WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.â The general belief here is that â¢
' after a conference of Senator Beveridge, Professor Schur- Cj_
wan and Secretary Root ivith the President it teas practically
* agreed to send Merriti to the I'hUippincs to take charge of the *
military and give Otis charge of civil affairs.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â A Washington special to the Herald says: No
ronlirmation can be obtained in official circles of the persistent rumors
that Major General Miles is to be sent to the Philippines to succeed Major
Genera] Otis. Inquiry at the Executive Mansion and at the War Depart
ment, including both Secretary Root and General Miles, brings forth the
one general statement that there Is no present Intention of relieving Major
ral Otis, * â¢
The authorities are expecting much of General Otis before the full
army of 65,000 men has reached Manila. An aggressive campaign is to be
commenced by General Otis with the troops he already has at hand at the
earliest possible moment. Indeed, the authorities are expecting to hear of
important movements by the forces of Generals Lawton and Mac Arthur.
The result of these operations and others which are to follow during the pres
ent month may have a good deal to do with the question of a new com
mai. ier for the Philippines. If there is any substantial military achieve
luring that time th^re is little likelihood that General Otis will be
relieved. If, on the other hand, the contemplated movements should not be
successful the President may feel constrained to supersede him.
Ev< n if future developments should induce the President to make such
a change, it is by no means certain that Miles will succeed Otis. The lat
ter, it is believed, will be retained as military commander In any event,
and the assignment of General Lawton or General Mac Arthur to take
command of :he forces in the field Is said in official quarters here to be
quit-> as probable as Miles' assignment to that command.
. '.. ni Schurmaa concluded his conferences with the officials here to
day and left to-night to resume his work at Cornell. Among other documents
left with the State I'tepartment by President Schurman was a large chart
of the Philippine group. On this the various races populating the islands are
graphically set out in colors. The significant feature is the small show-
Ing made by the Tagals. Not only does this chart show that that tribe
- but a small portion of the total population of the Philippines, but it
also makes It appear that the Tagals in Insurrection against the I'nited
Btatea constitute or.ly a portion of the strength of the entire tribe, and that
whole provinces h Luzon, notably at the northern extremity of the Island,
are either friendly to the United States or at least stand neutral.

wearily that he would be glad to be free.

CASEY'S FATE STILL IN
THE JUDICIAL BALANCE
ARGUING FOR LIBERTY BEFORE
JUDGE MURASKY.
More of the Local Wanderings of the
Conspirators Who Made San Fran
cisco Their Headquarters.
The fate of John Casey, the Australian
thief, is still hanging in the balance before
Judge Murasky of the Superior Court.
Shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon Judge Murasky opened the hearing
on the two petitions for writs of ha!" an
corpus on behalf of the pris< ner. The first
petition contested the jurisdiction of the
court on the ground that more than two
days had elapsed in one continuance;
against the defendant's objection, and :
hence under the law governing prelimin
ary examinations he must be discharged. .
The second demanded the release of the
prisoner on the ground that no probable '
cause existed, or in any event was proved
sufficient to warrant the magistrate hold
ing the defendant to answer before the j
Superior Court for the crime charged â j
grand larceny.
In support of the first petition It was
proved that Casey was taken before the j
magistrate on September 1. A contlnu- I
ancr was taken against the objection of!
the defendant until Tuesday, the sth lnst. i
It is contended by Judge L,ouderback, who I
represented the police, that as Sunday and !
Monday, which were legal holidays, inter- j
vened, the continuance taken was entirely
within the law. George D. Collins, the!
defendant's counsel, however, read from
the Code, which gives a magistrate the j
right to hold court for the purpose of pre- ;
limlnary examination not only on a holi
day but on Sunday as well. Hence be
claimed the statute had run against the
Jurisdiction of the magistrate and he was
deprived of pow<i in the premises. Jn
support of the second petition Mr. Collins
pointed to the fact that the clothes al
leged to have been stolen by the defendant;
were in fact sent to his apartments with- i
mit his solicitation, and If he took them j
and kept them, the evidence even failing '
to substantiate these claims, he was not !
guilty of larceny as charged.
.' Judge lÂ»uderback will argue for the
police to-day and then Judge Murasky
will render his decision.
The police In their investigations of the
movements of the conspirators did not
confine their attention to Kelly and his j
family. The thieves were far too clever j
to choose a rendezvous, and they made it i
their habit to meet wherever the necessl
ties of their business demanded. They
seldom m?t at one another's houses, as
they had been careful to choose habita
tions in the residence districts where the. i
presence and doings of strangers are
quickly noted. The gang found it expe- !
dient also to -frequently change the lo
cality of their residences. For example, !
Keily first went to the Russ House, and j
from there to 1104 Devisadero street.
Shortly after he and his Interesting fam
ily were domiciled at 1115 Pierce street,
and then again the. police found that he
had moved to 1110 Hush street, it required
n Kreat deal of patient labor on the: part
of the police to discover these facts, but
they are likely to be of marked vaJue in
subsequent developments.
Casey's spirit was as roving as that of j
Kelly. When the Australian crook first
came here he went to the Palace Hotel, j
He was a "professional" man, and noth- '
ing less than the best in accommodations
would suit him. He was simply trying to i
gel liis bearings, and the next time the
itolice heard of him he was living at 516
'owell street as F. Dunnle. He tl"Â»n '
moved to 911 Bush street, to be in thÂ«
same neighborhood with tCeiiy and -Au
gustus Howard. Murphy was less ambi- i
tious than his fellows, and the south side I
was better suited to his tastes. He first
registered at the Grand Hotel, and shortly j
after found apartments in a lodging-house
at Third and StÂ« venson streets.
Th*> police have in their possession a
letter which throws a curious side light
on the history of the malefactors and
their families. It will be remembered that ''
Mrs. IColly left here on February 24, 1809,
for the Colonies. On May 7 she sent a let- !
ter to her father, who was then in this
city. She stated that she had had a dis
tressing dream about her father, and she i
wrote to learn thf condition of his health. |
The letter forms a scrap in the mass of
evidence which has been, accumulated j
against Kelly by the police.

DISTINGUISHED VISITORS
AT THE STATE FAIR
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 7.â There
was a perfect crush at the Pa
vilion to-night, the principal at
tractions being the presence
there of William Jennings Bryan
I and Mrs. Bryan, and the Odd Fellows
and Rebekah degree lodges of this city
and outside towns. In order to avoid
co-nfusion and conflict of interests Mr.
Bryan visited the Pavilion shortly
after 7 o'clock. He was escorted there
by the Iroquois Club of this city, the
wives of some of the more prominent
i members of the club taking care of
Mrs. Bryan. The distinguished visit
ors were accorded all the courtesy pos
sible by the directors of the Agricul
| tural Society. They were shown all the
principal exhibits, which they enjoyed
very much. The committee of women
accorded Mrs. Bryan a cordial recep

! introduced to her.
This was Odd Fellows' day at the

SUIT AGAINST
A PRISONER
Novel Case in Marin
County.
Sp-ecla! Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Sept. 7.â A suit of a
novel nature was riled In the Justice
Court to-day by C. M. Parker, In which
the defendant, Mrs. Grace Allison, is an
inmata of San Quentin Prison. This is
the List suit of the kind to be filed in Ma
rin County, If not In the State, and is at
tracting the attention of the legal fra
ternity on account of the strange compli
cations that may result if the suit is
heard at this time.
Mrs. Allison was arrested in San Fran
cisco on account of her connection with a
number of fake wedding bureaus, and
after a trial which attracted a goud deal
of public notice was convicted and sent to
San Quentin for live years. She has
served six months of this term, and has
vainly petitioned the Governor for a par
don on account of ill health.
Parker makes Mrs. Allison the defend
ant in a suit for V-W. which sum he claims
was loaned her anil never repaid. It Is
predicted that an attempt to bring her
here will prove as futile as In the case of
the two opium smugglers, Ferrez and
Furnish, who were arrested on a felony
charge and could not be brought here be
cause ex-Warden Hale wished Judge An
gellc.tti to issue an order to that effect,
and his Honor claimed that he had no
right to take such action. There is also
considerable speculation as to why Parker
should sue the woman at this time, when
she has over four years more to serve.

BRITISH INTERESTS
NEGLECTED IN CHINA
Charges Made That Lord Salisbury
Gives All His Attention to the
Transvaal Difficulty.
VANCOUVER, B. <\, Sept. 7.â Recent
advices received here from Shanghai and
IVklng indicate that .Britishers in China
appear to think that the Transvaal ditti
culty has caused Lord Salisbury' to lose
sight of the interests of Great Britain in
China. One paper declares that Lord Sal
isbury's neglect' of British Interests and
prestige In China is becoming a scandal.
To Britishers in Peking it seems that their
Government has entirely abandoned them
They are being left to defend their posi
tion as best they can. with no aid from
the Foreign Office, and Great Britain is
positively an open laughing stock in t.Â»e
Tsung-li Yamen and foreign legations at
Peking.
British advice is treated with derision
at the Yamen. and the Ministers of that
institution are preparing to surrender
themselves completely nni unresistingly
to every demand of Russia.
I 'uring a recent typhoon in China the
dyke of the Tsaongo River, near Shaosh-
Ing, Che Kiang. was breached in five
places, the inundation caused by the
breaches being widespread, hundreds of
houses being swept away by the flood
The local authorities are reported to be
doing their best to alleviate the distress
of the people, a majority of whom have
lost their all. It is further stated that
the loss of life was very great.

GRAVE SCANDAL
MAY RESULT
Gen. Brooke's Actions
Criticized.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
Sept. 7. â Considerable comment has
been aroused here as a result of the
failure of General Brooke to impose a
tax upon railroads in Cuba and to car
ry out the department's instructions
relative to the imposition of a land tax,
and it is feared that another scandal
may result. Except for a small tax for
passengers and freight, both of which
are paid by the people and not by the
railroads, I learned to-day that the
corporations are not assessed one cent
for the protection they receive from the
Government. Not only do the roads
pay no taxes, but they charge exorbi
tant passenger and freight rates. Most
of the travel varies from more than 6
cents to nearly 15 cents per mile. Gen
eral Brooke himself has called the at
terrtion of the department to the ad
visability of reducing the tariff to a
uniform rate which will enable thepeo
ple of the island to freely use the
roads. The result of the imposition of
such a high tariff and .the exemption
of the roads from taxation is that the
railroads .are paying dividends of 15
and 20 per cent, and information re
( lived here shows that one of the roads
is paying a dividend of 3 and 4 per
rent a month. In an official report to
the War Department General Lee thus
describes the railroads in the provinces
under his command:
â¢There is a railroad from Reg
la across the harbor from Havana to
Bejucal, then in a westerly direction
by Guines to Matanzas; and still an
other from the city of Havana south,
then west by San Antonio de Los Banos
to Guanjay, in the province of Pinar
del Rio; and yet another which also
runs in a southern direction from Ha
vana by Buira de Melena, then west
war.lly to Pinar del Rio City. This is
known as the Western Railroad, and.
as far as I know, is an independent or
ganization.
"The stock in other railroads is
owned principally by Englishmen. In
addition to these railroads, there is also
one running from Havana some eisrht
miles to Mariano, and from that city
north a few miles to the oc^an.
"There are in all 1160 miles of track
age on the island, not including subur
ban and plantation roads. Englishmen
and Spaniards are largely interested in
railroad stock. I understand the Van
derbilts have made arrangements for
the purchase of a railroad in the prov
ince of Santiago de Cuba, but whether
the deal has finally been consummated
Is not known here.
"It has been estimated that by the im
position of a moderate tax on railroads
the internal revenue derived from the
island will be Increased by at least a
quarter of a million dollars. So far as
is known here. General Brooke has
taken no action contemplating any tax
upon the roads beyond the ticket and
freight taxes which are paid by pas
senger or shipper.
Instructions were sent to General
Brooke BOrne months ago to impose a
land tax, but up to this time, so far
as is known by the department, he has
not carried them out. It is possible
that he has been so busily engaged that
he has not been able to get at this
matter, or he may have taken action
a/id not informed the department. In
any event, the authorities would like
to "know just what General Brooke has
done in this connection."

the November meeting of the Supervisors.
I'nlimitofl electric power can be devel

to be of the standard gauge, and the time
limit for the completion of the work is

BOLD BURGLAR IS
BETRAYED BY BELLS
He Enters Mrs. S. M. Wilson's Resi-
dence, but Is Frightened Off by
an Electrical Alarm.
A bold burglar entered the residence of
Mrs. Samuel M Wilson, 711 Pine street,
shortly before midnight last night and
while moving through the house set oft*
a burglar alarm. Mrs. Wilson had just
returned home when the tinkling of the
bell reached her ears and she sent a ser
vant to her room to investigate. He found
the window open, but no one around and
be so reported to his mistress.
About a half hour later another burglar
alarm rang and this time a Chinese ser
vant and the butler were sent to the din
ing room to investigate. On their en
trance they discovered a burly intruder,
but were so frightened at the sight that
they fled from his presence incontinently.

age and she immediately communicated
with the California street station and also
aroused the neighborhood by blowing a
police whistle.
A squad of officers were soon on the
scene and they began a systematic but
unsuccessful search for the burglar. A
thorough investigation showed that not a
thing had been taken.
It is believed that the burglar made his
escape into the street immediately after
his discovery. A description of him was
given the police and it is expected he will
soon be apprehended.

A CORRECTION,
L Monday The Call, in reviewing the in
trigues now under way to bring about the elec
tion of Dan Burns to the United States Senate
at an f.xtr. the Legislature, published an 1
estimate made by a well-informed member of that
body of the way the Republican Senators and Assem
blymen would probably vote if the extra session were j
held. In th"c estimate certain members were classified !
as being in favor of a caucus, some against it and
tful.
.. In the article in which the estimate was given The
inted out that it differed in some respects
from information The Call had obtained from other
and therefore could not be accepted as alto
gether accurate Despite that statement some of our i
contemporaries appear to have taken it as the esti
mate of The Call itself, and we refer to it for the
purpo sipating that error.
The Fresno Democrat, in discussing the subject,
makes upon it many comments, some good, some bad. i
and some indifferent. Two of these are worth
notice. In the first place the Democrat joins with The
Call and the pre^s generally in condemning the pro
posed extra session as a threatened wrong to the
State and the taxpayers. In the second place it points
out that in the estimate made by the member of the
Legislature and published in The Call Senator Rowell
of Fresno is put on the doubtful list, and says: "The j
Democrat does not believe that there can be any
doubt in Dr. Rowell's mind. He has in person and ,
through his paper championed another man's .cause.
The Senator from this district has at least probity and ;
consistency in his record up to date, and it is difficult
to < redit the supposition that he would favor an
c tr.t session if he entertained the faintest idea that
ite would, as has been claimed, be disgraced
!iy the outcome."
The Call cordially approves the commendation thus
given to the firmness ;md consistency of Senator
Bowel!. It is not at all likely that he is doubtful on j
such an issue as is presented in this case. The fact
that he and others were wrongly classified in the list
was the reason why The Call was. so careful to ppint '
out at the time thai it could not be fully relied upon.
It was published solely as a part of the news of the !
day, to show what calculations are being made on this j
question of so much interest to the peoplf
MORE TALK IN THE TRANSVAAL.
WHILE the evasive reply of President Kruger
to the proposals of the British Government
may not have the same effect in turning away
| wrath that a soft answer would have had, it never
i theless serves the purpose of postponing hostilities,
continuing the negotiations and providing an oppor-
I tunity for the sou answer to come in later on.
Despite the recent declaration of Secretary Cham- [
berlain that Great Britain would refuse to tolerate
j further evasion on the part of the Boers it is not at
all likely the British Government will neglect to avail
itself of the new chance given for a peaceable solution
of the South African troubles. The prbmise of the
Boers sounds fair at least, and if it be rejected the
sympathies of the world will be on their side.
In the course of the answer the Transvaal Govern
ment, after declaring it has never desired Great Brit
am to abandon any rights possessed by virtue of the
London convention cf 1884, or by virtue of interna
tional law. and reasserting upon the question of
suzerainty the position taken in former dispatches,
takes up the proposals of Chamberlain for a joint
commission to undertake an inquiry into the alleged
grievances of Britisli subjects in the Transvaal, and
says: "Considering that by these proposals Great j
Britain does not aim at any interference in the affairs ,
of the Transvaal, and that the action would not be re- j
garded as a precedent, but has solely for its object I
ascertain whether the franchise law fulfills its purpose,
the Transvaal Government will a.vaitthe ulterior pro
posals of Great Britain as to the eventual constitution
of such commission, as well as the place and the time
of meeting."
A reply of that nature affords no excuse for a
declaration of war nor for an ultimatum. The only
issue Great Britain can make out of it would be the
implied rejection of the claim of suzerainty, but as
that implication -is accompanied by an express declare
tion that the Boers have no desire to dispute any fight
which may have accrued to Great Britain under the
treaty of 1884, it is not easy to see how an issue could
be raised even on that point unless Chamberlain
â  should concede that the treaty gives the British no
right to suzerainty.
Judging of the situation from this distance it ap
pears the British have everything to gain by a wait
ing policy and' nothing to gain by war. There is a #
liberal party in the Transvaal which if left free to
deal with the problems of the country will certainly
sooner or later give encouragement to the con
of new railroads, the opening of
mines, the building of factories and the dev< I
opment of a complex civilization out of the pas
toral community that holds the land. If the British
interfere, the liberals will inevitably side with 'their
fellow countrymen again>t the foreigners, and the
result will be a conservative reaction, whose effc
could not be overcome for years, even if the country
were overrun by the British.
Moreover, it is by no means certain the country
can be overrun. The Boers have strnne allies amoi
their kinsmen not only in Orange Free State but in â¢
Cape Colony itself. In addition to that they are
among the sturdiest fighter* and best marksmen
known to. the world. In former battles with British
troops the superiority of their fire has enabled them
to slaughter their foes with comparatively little loss
to themselves. At Laings Neck 174 British were killed
in a few minutes, while the loss of the Boers was
trifling. At Ingogo River the British lost 150 out of
270 men engaged, and the loss of the Boers was but
eight. At Majuba Hill the British lost 226 men out
of a force of 400, and the Boers but one.
Such marksmen are not to be assailed without
cause, and the British Government will doubtless take
advantage of Kruger's offer and postpone the ulti
matum. -
The Dominicans seem as ready to take liberties
with the language as they are ready to upset their
governments. That little affair in San Domingo
which began with the assassination of the Presidem,
developed in the death of scores of Dominican sol
diers and ended in the accession of 'a new executive
is now called an evolution and not a revolution.
The English advocates before the Anglo-
Venezuelan Boundary Commission insist that America
bases her contentions upon a whim. The whimsii
ity of. the affair did not strike the British so forcibly
when American guns threatened to be the arbiters.
THE CAMPAIGN IN OHIO.
OHIO is no longer an "October State," and
consequently the campaigns there are .no
longer watched intently for signs and por
tents of what the general elections in November wili
bring forth. Neither is it this year the doubtful
State it has been in former times, for all prospects
indicate a Republican victory. Nevertheless the con
test there is interesting, for it is very sure to be the
most exciting of the year.
Each of the greater States of the Union has some
characteristic which distinguishes its politics from
that of any other State. The characteristic of Ohio
is faction fighting within party lines. Hardly a cam
paign takes place there which is not marked to a great
degree by personal antagonisms, and these frequently
have as much to do as anything else in determining
the result at the polls.
The Republicans of the State this year are fairly
well united, and yet it is safe to say that some of the
men who were so active in the effort to defeat the
election of Ilarma to the United States Senate will
knife the ticket this fall by way of revenge. In the
Democratic party the factions are sure to rage bit
terly, for John R. McLean, the nominee For Gov
ernor, has been a most desperate faction fighter him
self in times past and bushwhacked Thunnan and
Pendleton in the days of their supremacy with a
vigor that finally defeated them and drove them from
office.
It is not easy to determine what ambition has
prompted McLean to set himself up for Governor
this year, for he' appears to have assumed the leader
ship of a forlorn hope and put himself in a position
a here the friends of Thurman and Pendleton can
even up old scores. He has not been regarded as 2.
fool in times past, however vicious he may have been.
and hence some have drawn the conclusion that he
sees a chance to win, and is willing to run the risk
because if successful it will advance his ambition to
become the candidate, of his party for the Presidency
next year.
The platform on which he has chosen to stand U
one of the most extraordinary claptrap constructions '
ever put together even by the Democratic party in
these days of Rryanism. It reaffirms the wild doc
trines of the Chicago platform and emphatically' in
dorses the demand for the free coinage of silver at the
ratio of 16 to r, and then proceeds to denounce "the
secret and vicious alliance now 'in evidence between
England and the Republican administration whereby !
this nation may become involved in war with foreign..
nations."
The most glittering plank in the whole platform, 1
however, is that which declarer: "Political bosses
are to be detested, and are inimical to our form of 1
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1899.
government. Bosses represent simply a concentration
of political power, or a ring. They live and exist
through jobs and schemes loaded upon the taxpay
ers. They substitute their rule in their party for the
rule of its voters. ' They select the nominees, who, ii
elected, remain their tools, and administer their offi
cial powers in the interest of their boss and not for
the people. The Republican party in Ohio is now in
such control."
Thus the intelligent voters of Ohio are asked to
support for Governor one of the notoriously bad
bosses in politics upon a platform denouncing bosses.
It is one of the most brazen exhibitions of audacity
ever given, and yet the man who devised the plan of
campaign and by putting himself at the head of it has
staked his political fortunes on the result is generally
supposed to be an astute politician. He will of course
make a. hard fight, and. despite the odds against him,
the campaign is going to be interesting to the whole
nation.

NATIVE SONS AND VOLUNTEERS.
Q DMISSIOX DAY wiH receive this year one of
/ \ the most glorious celebrations in the annals of
the State. That much is. already assured by
the preparations that have been made by the Native
Sons and Native Daughters, into whose hands the
preparations for the observance of the annual festival
have been committed by common consent in all parts
of the State. ,
The chief scene of the celebration will be at Santa
Cruz, where arrangements have been made on a grand
scale. Along with the Native Sons will go the men
ot the First Regiment of California Volunteers, whose
service in the Philippines has added a new luster to
th: history of the State and augmented the patriotic
pride of its people. That their presence will add to
the enthusiasm of the occasion goes without saying.
for the ardot of the reception given them on their
arrival in this city attests tlie honor in which they are
held by the great mass of their fellow countrymen.
( >n each returning Admission day we rejoice in the
greatness and prosperity of the commonwealth and
with a fond pride recount the many features that en
dear it to its people and excite the admiration of the
rest of the Union. On this occasion we shall have
reason to exult also in the proof that has been given
that the youth of the State is in every way worthy of
the noble heritage that is theirs and equal to the
arduous requirements of the lofty destiny that awaits
it as tlfe empire State of the Pacific. California can
to-day regard her sons with as much pride as they
regard her. In the fields of war as well as in the pur
suits of peace they have upheld her cause and illus
trated her devotion to the Union and to the welfare
of humanity.
Santa Cruz has robed her streets in festal array for
the reception of the Native Sons and -Volunteers.
The beautiful city by the sea has been the chosen spot
of many a gathering and the scene of many a festi
val, but for none were more brilliant preparations
marie than for the visitor? who are now to celebrate
within her precincts the anniversary of the admission
of California to the Union. It is to be a great day
in her history, and her people are well aware of it.
A genuine Califomian welcome awaits every visitor,
and it is a foregone conclusion the celebration will be
in all respects one of social enjoyment as well as of
patriotic enthusiasm.

DECLARATIONS recently made by the counsel
for Colonel Carter have had the effect of divid
ing public sentiment on the ca^e and giving to
the situation an aspect bearing in many respects ri
striking resemblance to the Dreyfus case. In the
American as in the French affair we have an officer of
the army tried by court-martial and condemned, a
charge of wrongful conviction brought about by a
giant conspiracy, a demand for a new trial in the
civil courts, and an array of evidence put forth by
attorneys of good standing to support their extra
ordinary assertions of injustice on the part of the gen
eral staff of the army.
Before the recent .declarations were made the press
of the country was unanimous in calling for the pun
ishment of Carter in accordance with the findings oi
the court-martial. The fact that for nearly two years
since his conviction he has been permitted full free
dom and full pay has been regarded as a public scan
dal. It was everywhere cited as a proof that while
small offenders arc punished the larger rascals, whose
robberies run up into the millions of dollars, go free
by reason of corrupt influe-nces exerted by powerful
friends. At present, however, a considerable num
ber of the leading newspapers of the country see in
the neglect to punish Carter an evidence that the
authorities are by no means satisfied he was rightly
condemned.
The counsel for Carter contend that a detail of
officers such as composed the court-martial was ut
terly unfit to handle such a complex question, and
that Â«uch tribunals, regardless of their personal char
acter and intentions, are by reason of their lack of
training and competency "organized to convict."
Thus the argument for the defense is based upon the
unfitness of the court-martial to try the case, the al
leged irregularity of the procedure, the competency
of the witnesses heard for the prosecution and the
evidence elicited. The brief states explicitly and em
phatically that there lias been no attempt to delay con
sideration of the case, that no appeal has been made
in the defendant's behalf by his counsel or friends to
the President or anybody else for mercy, but, on the
contrary, that an effort has been sedulously made to
get a final decision; and full responsibility is accepted
by counsel for the silence of the defendant in regard
to the charges made.
On the showing made there has already sprung up
a strong sentiment in favor of a rehearing of the case
by a civil tribunal. As the New York Times says
concerning the assertion of Carter's counsel that he
is entitled to acquittal without a retrial: "Whether
or not we accept his conclusion that there is no
ground for the retrial of Captain Carter, we must ac
cept his conclusion that there is no ground for his
retrial by court-martial. The review of the case makes
this very plain. If Captain Carter has committed an
offense it is an offense cognizable by civil courts of

BIG PLANS FOR REACHING
THE SOUTH POLE
UNDER this heading Gilbert 11. Grosvenor contributes a prospectus of the
two Antarctic expeditions that are soon to be sent out under British and
German auspices respectively. Says Mr. Grosvenor in the National Geo
graphical Magazine, August:
"Announcement is made that the British Government is ready to grant
a subsidy of $200,000 for the Antarctic expedition that is to set out In the summer
of 180] under iho joint patronage of the Royal Society and of the Royal Geo
graphical Society, and unless the promoters of the German expedition are being
misled in their expectations, the Reichstag will soon guarantee substantial aid
to the German national expedition. Â» * â¢ The plans of :he (British) expedition
have not yet been fully determined In all their details, but It has been decided that
:!:>â¢ ship slirill follow what Is known as the South American route, sailing from
the South Shetland Islands southward to Alexandria Land. Here, at about 70
degrees south by 90 degrees west, a landing will be mad' "if practicable, and the
first station established. Continuing onward, their course being dependent upon
the amount of ice encountered, the party expects to establish on Cape Adare,
Victoria Land, a second station, from which the great dash for the South Pole
â will- be attempted, and in the vicinity of -which the principal scientific -work will
be accomplished. * Â» â¢
"The principal danger to navigation in the Antartic region is not ice
pressure, for the currents radiate outward' and not inward, but rather the
stormy nature of the sea. Captain Dryga-lski, leader of the German expedition,
proposes, therefore, to construct his ship on lines that will Insure seaworthiness.
This he believes can Vie secured by a vessel stanchly built of wdod, with strong
internal sup*l";rts, which will at the same time afford protection against pow
erful magnetic influences.
"The Kerguelen Islands, lying in the Indian Ocean at 70 degrees east by 50
degrees south and open to navigation at all seasons of the year, are to be the
starting point. From these islands the route follows a line southwestward to
some point on Wilkes Land, where a winter station will be built upon the edge
of the ice-sheet and systematic observations taken. In the early spring an
advance will be attempted on sleds across the ice In the direction of the mag
netic pole, and In the fall a return will be made In a westerly direction along
the litil<>-known const of Wilkes Land. Perhaps the party will be able to reach
tli.- mofit southerly known land. Victoria Land, discovered by Ross In 1842. As
the English explorers are to build a station on the edge of this same Victo
ria Land and thence proceed southward as well as along Wilkes Land, Victoria
Land will be the objective meeting ground of both expeditions. But natur
ally no geographic limits can be set in a region about which scarcely a single
conclusion can be formed."
It is believed that the following year will be specially favorable for Antarctic
work, we are told by Mr. GrosvenoV, as we are now in a warm temperature period
and the ice in those regions is at a minimum. Mr. Grosvenor concludes his notice
with the following paragraph:
"The advantages, both from a geographic and general scientific point of view,
of a further exploration <>f the South Polar regions have been so repeatedly set
forth that it is hardly necessary to enlarge upon them here. Briefly they may be
stated as: the verification or disproof of the existence of a vast Antarctic con
tinent; The determination of the origin of the cold ocean currents which have
their rise in the South; the study of t.ie nature of Ice itself, of the differences be
tween lnnd Ice, sea ice, river ice, etc.: and the investigation of the conditions
of fctmospheric pressure and temperature, of volcanic action, and of terrestrial
magnetism within the Antarctic-circle."
COMMUNICATIONS
OUR FUTURE TRADE
WITH THE PHILIPPINES
To the Editor of The Call-Sir: There is
no Californlan so lacking In good sense
as not to wish that San Francisco's trade
with the Philippines may "multiply and
still increase." On the question how best
to secure that desirable end opinions'
differ.
Some are impressed with the idea that
trade necessarily follows the flag. Were
this the case Spain should In the past
have had the lion's share of Philippine
trade. I'he figures given in this years
United States Agricultural Year Book
show thai such was not the case. Great
Britain had nearly 34 per cent; Spain
merely 18 per cent, while the United States'
share was about 10 per cent only. This
current years figures will of course show
an abnormal Increase. It will be well for
our morehants to note that this years
returns will be necessarily abnormal. Ihe
goods exported from San Francisco have
beta in the main for the supply of our
own citisena temporarily residing in the
islands, either as soldiers or civilians. The
liquor trad-: is an example of this, the
statement having been made that since
the American invasion 4H2 saloons have
been opened in Manila alone. Of course
with the return of our army this trade
would be likely to discontinue.
The general trade of the islands would
follow In the main its usual channels,
which is simply saying the products
would follow the best demandâ the coun
tries wanting most Manila hemp would
buy most Manila hemp, and so on with
the sugar and other products, unless
change of tariff caused alteration. The
Philippine demand for imported goods
would be very much the same as before
the war, unless consumption is diminish
ed by a serious diminution of consumers
slaughtered in war, or by the impoverish
ment of the residue from the wastes and
discouragements of war.
Probably out best chance of holding
and increasing our trade is to make the
Filipinos our friends as rapidly and ef
fectually us may be, by assuring them
their entire independence. Gratitude for
benefits conferred is usually a more po
tent factor in Inducing friendly inter
course than is hatred and lust for revenge
consequent on injuries suffered. The con
sumption of tea in Boston was not in
creased by King George's pig-headed op
pression. America free and friendly is
alike Britain's mart and Britain's gran
ary. Filipinos free and friendly will be
not only far "more creditable, but far more
profitable to America than Filipinos sul
len, conquered and impoverished from
protracted war.
That we may yet use sucii a policy as
Funston recommends of less gunpowder
and more conciliation is the desire, sir,
of many Californians, including yours
truly, EDWARD BERWICK,

SELF DEFENSE
THE PLEA FOR A
DOUBLE MURDER
Preliminary Examin
ation of G. Tanner.
The preliminary examination of George
Tanner on the. charge of murdering Dep
uty Sheriff James Brown and Mrs. Fannie
Barnes, at 503 Folsom street, August 26,
was commenced before Judge Conlan yes
terday afternoon. The defense is making
an effort to show self-defense and two
witnesses at least examined yesterday
gave color to the plea.
John Lambert, a boy, testified, that he
heard Tanner go to Brown's door and us
ing a vile name, ask Brown to come out
side and he would do him up. When wit
ness came into the hall Tanner was walk
ing excitedly up and own without his hat
and coat. "Witness went into his room
and when he came out again Brown and
Tanner were scuffling in the hall. Brown
got Tanner down and had him by the
throat. Brown pulled a gun out of his
pocket and attempted to strike Tanner on
â¢he head with the butt end. Witness said
to Brown not to hit Tanner while he was
down and Brown handed him his keys
and told him to go to the patrol box and
ring in for the patrol wagon. Witness
went to the patrol box and when he re
turned Brown and Mrs. Barnes had. been
shot.
Mercy Phillips testified that Brown and
Mrs. Barnes called her into their room
and told her that they were having
trouble with Tanner. She went into her
own room and soon afterward heard
scuttling in the hall. Mrs. Barnes was
screaming and telling Brown to keep his
hands on Tanner. She heard Brown say:
"1 nave got you where J want you now
and I am going to kill you."
Charles Thurston testified that he saw
Brown on top of Tanner and Tanner bog
ged to be let up. He got up and then
asked to get his coat and hat, but Brown
objected. Tanner had a revolver in his
hand and Bred at Brown. Mrs. Barnes
came screaming out of her room and Tan
ner tired a shot at her.
James Lambert testified that he' heard
two men fall up against the door and
scuffling. He looked out and then shin
his door. He heard the shots fired and
when he came out of his room he saw
Brown and Mrs. Barnes dead on the
porch.
William Aufenanger saw Brown having
Tanner by the throat on the Hour and
heard Brown tell Joe Lambert to ring for j
th- patrol wagon. William Phillips testi
fied that he was in the dining-room when
Tanner came in and asked the landlord,
Louis Millc. for a revolver. After the
.shooting Phillips asked Tanner why he
did it and he said he had to defend him
self.
Dr. Zabala, autopsy physician, testified
as to the nature of the wounds. Thomas
U. Ford, chief jailer, testified to seeing
Tanner waiting outside the jail, evidently
for Brown, that afternoon and other wit
nesses â¢ testified to 'i\.~*at gala" around

STERLING MEN ARE
NOT SEEKING OFFICE
SEVEN DEMOCRATS ON A STILL
HUNT FOR CANDIDATES.
Republicans Looking Over the Field
for Acceptable Material for the
Board of Supervisors.
Th<- Beven m^n appointed by Jasper Mc-
Donald to select Democratic nominees for
the Board of Supervisors held another
session laÃt evening at County Committee
headquarters in the Columbian building.
Responsible citizens of high standing: are
not tumbling over each other in haste to
have their names placed before the com
mittee. Outward signs indicate that thÂ«
Beven are engaged in a hunt for can
didates. There is no lack of suggestions
from a few of the old guard of place-hunt
ers, but it is noted that sterling represen
tatives cf the city do not encourage the
committee by attendance. The absence of
leading men may be attributed to the
general notion that Gavin McNab and
Mayoi Phelan have a slate ticket already
prepared which will be brought out when
nominations are in order.
EL V. Whitney, chairman of the seven,
remarked last night that an executive ses-
Bion would probably be held next Monday
evening and at that session the question
mighi be determined whether the com
mitt.' should recommend only eighteen
names, or a larger number.
Delegates to the Republican nominating
committee are looking over the field to
find th< most acceptable material fur the
Board of Supervisors. The delegates are
not rallying around any one of the men
tinned ('and i dates for Mayor. The posi
tive declination of A. B. Spreokels and F.
W Duhrmann leaves the field open to
Horace Davifl Henry Crocker, Irving M.
Scott Phil I.ilienthal. Vanderlynn Stow,
Louis' Sloss Jr.. W. R. Smedburg, George
A. Newhall, Victor Duboce and others.

THE TURNER MURDER.
Counsel Argue the Case and Judge
Graham Reserves His Decision.
The arguments of counsel in the case
of Joseph P. Frenna, charged with ;he
murder of James F. Turnpr. real estate
:i â¢â <tu occupied aboul two hours before
Judge Qrahaip yesterday morning.
Attorney Hosmer, for the defendant,
moved for a dismissal rf the case on the
ground thai tin defendant acted in self
defense, but the motion was vigorously
opposed by Attorney George D. Collins,
who contended that everything pointed
to the conclusion that the murder was
premeditated.
The Judge said he would reserve nis
decision till this morning and a motion of
Hosmer to allrw" the defendant out on
bonds was denied.

Fruit and Salmon in England.
The London market for California fruits and |
salmon Is reported by the Grocers' Gazette of
August 19 as follows: Fruitsâ Calif ornlan
fruits are firmly held, but there iB only a llm- â 
Ke.l business doing, owing to the paucity of
supplies. Salmonâ The market is fairly steady,
.-uid while generally there is not a large amount
of business doing, one considerable transaction
has b<-en effected, a Liverpool arm having taken
a fairly large block of Eraser River salmi at
"combination" prices. Advices have been re
ceived stating that there baa been a consider
able improvement in the run of fish on the
Frnser River, and it is estimated that the total
pack in British Columbia will probably be
about 100.000 cases in excess of last year, when,
it will be remembered, the pack was a. compar
atively small one.

EASTERN MARKETS.
Nezv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â The market suc
cumbed to the combined Influence of a hard
ening rate on account of the gathering war
cloud in South Africa. A few of the highly
speculative Industrial specialties were marked
up in the early dealings and at different times
during the day In an effort to â Ist the de
cline. The attempt proved unavailing to .over
come the depression in the general list and
the manipulative stocks In some cases finally
weakened, though a few retained a net ad-
vance. Tennessee Coal was marked up a point
at the opening, but that was the highest of
tiie day. Sugar, Tobacco, Brooklyn Transit,
Federal Steel and a few other stocks among
tii" prominent industrials vibrated above and
below lsÂ«t night's price. Pullman Palace Car
t.-.-is at one time up four points, but lost It
a!!. Th* -American Car stocks rose two points
' t-ncit. but the preferred receded to the level
at the opening. Pressed Steel Car preferred
ndvancd a point In the closing dealing.
Those movements, a reflection of the large de
mand for railroad equipment, had little effect
(â :'. the general lint. American Hoop stocks
â¢were strong on reported large earnings, rising
Z for the common and l'.fc for the preferred.
There were me large orders executed for
1 nlted Slates Leather, which raised the price
about a point. The preferred stock advanced
In sympathy, but lost all the gain. These were
the only Important exception* to the weak
m-ps of the active stocks. St. Paul showed
some resistance, but Rave way with the other
grangers when intimations were heard that
there would be no increase In the dividend
rates. The rate .â -til! continued at Z i per cent.
There were decline* In the railroads quite uni
formly between 1 and 2 per cent. Including- the
j.iTjmfnent grangers. Southwestern*. Pacifies,
Trunk line* and Southern railroads. Stocks
which have had a recent sharp advance show
â¢wide declines. ; . v;
Money on call commanded 6 per cent most
of the. day and went as high as 6 per cent,
with only a few exceptions below 5 per cent.
The subtreasury hail a small debit balance at
the clearing-hause to-day, but the banks have
lost over $3,000,000 to that Institution since Frl
<sny and expect to increase that amount before
the rIoFC of the wÂ«Â»k. There were further
transfers to the South to-day and the banks
p.re etill losing on balance to the interior. The
1 ixdnesa of money here did not avail to lower
ti:<- rate of sterling exchange. In view of the
Increase in discounts irj London, which also
had the effect of ralslnp the rates of sterling
exchange In Paris and Berlin. London's sales,
about 26,000 shares of stock here, helped to
keep up the exchange rate. It Is apparent that '
under present conditions abroad a considerably
higher rate for money here will be required to !
induce Imports of gold.
Bonds showed a weakening tendency In sym- |
pathy with stocks, Kan; is and Texas seconds 1
being notably affected. Total sales, par value,
$1,623,000.
United States bonds unchanged In bid quo- â 
tations.

Chicago Grain Market.
t â : â . . â^
> CHICAGO, Sept. 7.â The firmness shown by
yesterday's Wheat market was still apparent
at the opening In Wheat and notwithstanding
favorable news initial prices were a shade
higher. Liverpool was about lid higher, due
to the advance here yesterday, and to the con
tinued drought In India, and to this fact part
of the buying which characterized the early
trading was due. Offerings, however, soon ex
cee.led the demand, which was almost entirely
{rum the outside, and the .â¢mall opening ad
vance was soon lost. Local professionals did
little buying and a liquidating movement of
respectable proportions set in on the posting
01 Bradst reel's ligures on the world's available
supply, which put the surplus at 139,000,000
bushels as compared with 56,000. bushels last
year. This soon ceased and for the remainder
of the* session trading was ridiculously small.
The weather was too hot for even the most
enthusiastic trader, and the pit, lor the greater
part of the time was half deserted. A feature
was the large Western movement. Primary
receipts amounted to 1,154,000 bushels, the Hn#i"e
as last year. This tact had little effect on
prices, but increased the bearish feeling among
traders and little support of any kind i was
forthcoming until the price had got below puts,
When realizing and buying against those priv
ileges caused a slight rally and gave the mar
ket an appearance of firmness toward the close.
The cash demand here was slow, but the sea
board reported a moderate export demand, with
fifteen loads engaged. December Wheat opened
a shade higher at 71*4 c and sold Immediately
at 71. â . It slowly declined to 71 I ! Sc, and
rallied to 71% c, where it closed.
Ccrn barely held its own, with the range
narrow and the trade In general slow. There
was some attempt by professional bulls to
boost prices on the dry. hot weather, but pre
dictions of general rains brought selling orders.
December closed unchanged: September closed
a shade higher.
'1 here was a fair sized business' done In Sep
tember Oats, and that commodity advanced
sharply, The buying was done mostly by cash
people, who were evidently short, and there
was little offered. December closed Vie higher
September Â«!'Â«'-l H'S%c higher.
Provisions were dull and after a little firm
ness arourfd the opening rather heavy. Later
commission houses sold moderately Â«md ad
vances were lost. The close was steady; Octo
ber Pork S%c lower. Lard and Ribs a shade
hither.

. Northern Wheat Market.
OREGON.
PORTLAND, Sept. 7.â The bright weather
has slightly eased up the demand for wheat
at very much of a premium over export prices.
It is apparent that all of the wheat has not
been damaged and that it will not be ab
solutely necessary to pay famine prices now
or later on, and buyers are accordingly pro
ceeding with more caution, although offerings
are very light. A cent a pound Is about the
proper quotation for Walla Walla up to file
per bushel for milling purposes; 61-pound wheat
might bring 61c. For Valley. 60Â©61 cis obtain

WHEAT- The Chicago market opened dull
and steady. Cables were V" higher, and there
was some little Investment buying. Increased
receipts and the condition of the freight mar-
Icet, however, operated against any advance,
though better values were looked for shortly.
The shorts have covered freely of late, but
will resell unless a good export demand ap
pears. Broomhall cabled that Russian wheat
was moving slowly under the high, prices
there, and that the Indian situation was be
coming worse.

YEARS IN JAIL
FOR ACTS OF
HASTY ANGER
Volunteers Who Must
Pay the Piper.
COURT-MARTIALED IDAHO MEN
MEDALS FOR THE CALIFORNIA
MEN WHO FOUGHT.
Adjutant General Corbin Says Major
General Shafter Will Remain in
the Service as a Volunteer
Officer.
The lifo of the volunteer is not an easy j
one, but it becomes particularly hard j
when he tries to indulge In little breaches
of the law of the land, which out of the j
service are looked upon as censurable j
but not necessarily punishable. To .strike j
a man is not considered serious by a |
jury, but it is very serious before a
court-martial, and the law makes no dis
tlnctlou because of station, while a soldier
multiplies his offense by three or four
when he selects an officer as the object of
his wrath. That is what some men of
the Idaho Regiment are now finding out. j
Four of them were sent to the guard j
house at the Presidio yesterday and j
formally turned over to Colonel Freeman, j
commandant of the post. They are Meade
Barr of Company F, sentenced to two j
years' Imprisonment at hard labor, for- ]
feiture of all pay and allowances due or !
to accrue and dishonorable discharge
from the army of the United States; Ed
ward Thlerolf, Company H, under simi
lar sentence; Edward Callam, Company
H, sentenced to one year, forfeiture of
pay and allowances and dishonorable dis
charge, and George Guyett, .Company D,
sentenced to six months' Imprisonment,
forfeiture of pay and allowances and dis- j
honorable discharge.
All the men except Guyett were In the
Billbid, a prison at Manila, for nearly a
year, so they will serve only a part of
their sentences here. They will be re
moved to Alcatraz to-day or to-morrow.
The crime in the case of Barr and
Thlerolf is striking an officer; Callam'a
case, threatening to strike an officer; in
Guyett'a case, shooting at a soldier. Ine
charge against all is conduct to the
prejudice of good order and military
discipline, in violation of the articles of
war.
Barr, Thierolf and Callam were incar
cerated in the guardhouse at Manila for
some minor offense. They were all more
or less intoxicated, and tney rowed with
'he officers of the guard. Thlerolf, who is
a Dig, burly miner, look two of the offi
cers of the* Fourteenth United States ln
tantry, which was on guard duty with
the idaho troops, and knocked their heads
together. Barr struck one of his own
oincers, who came to quiet the men, and
â¢Jaliam got only - -" far as to show a Will
ingness to mix in the light. ....
Guvett was arrested and charged with
an attempt to kill a soldier. The wit
nesses against him did not give sufficient
evidence to prove so grave an offense, so i
he was convicted of what in common Jaw ;
would be an assault. A general court
martial tried and sentenced the men in
Manila and they came here as prisoners.
Since the regiment has been at the Pre- j
sidio th* men have been kept in the guard ,
tent They expected all along that they
would be released as soon as tney arrived
here and they made no attempt to escape |
âa wise move on their part, for the army |
never forgets a missing prisoner. here j
has been no commutation of the sentence, ;
however, and yesterday the four were
placed in keeping safer than the guard
tent of a camp.
The offenses of Ban and Thierolf are
very similar to that of McVeigh of the â 
Wyoming battalion, who came here under i
sentence of death for striking Lieutenant :
Wrlghter. Under the circumstances the j
sentences imposed were light. They serve i
as a warning to other volunteers, how
ever to remember that there are certain
offenses in time of war which even the
sentiment of voluntary service cannot
condone. Courts-martial have not been
hard on the volunteers, and what sen
tences were passed have been forgotten
or buried by the various commands, but
from stories that keep coming back with
the troops it is evident some of the arti
cles of war have been severely strained
down in the Islands.
Saturday. September 16. is the date set
for decorating the California men who
fought In the war. P. J. dv Py and W. D.
Shea of the Native Sons' medal commit
tee called on Colonel Duboce yesterday
and reported the date to him, as well as
what arrangements had been made. Col
onel Duboce promised to assist in every
way possible to make the affair a success,
as ihe ceremony of giving is going to be
made as Important, if possible, as the
medal Itself. ,
The regiment will be drawn up on the
parade ground at the Presidio, and each
man will bf called up to have his medal
pinned on his blouse by one of the Native
Daughters. Every man will be given a
certificate with his medal, on which will
be his name and rank and the reasons for
his decoration. The medals will be num
bered and a careful record of those pre
sented will be kept, so the decorations
will be fully protected and no one not en
titled to the honor may wear one. A
medal will be given for every man. If he
be present he will get it before his com
rades and In the presence of the people.
If he be absent it will be sent to him
when he can be properly located. If he
is dead his nearest relative will be given
the honor for which he paid his life.
After the men of the First Regiment
and the Heavy Artillery have been deco
rated the committee will take up the case
â of the men who served at home, It will
be some time before the medals for them

California Is dividing his time between
camp and the city, for some of his pa
tients have escaped him and have been
attacked with disease out of bounds.
There are three men of the regiment who
are seriously ill with pneumonia. They
admit themselves it is the result of wear
ing their khaki uniforms and light flan

admission makes their case no better.
'. They were taken sick at home and Dr.

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
JOHN NICHOL'S
CHILDREN MAY
BE WITNESSES
Sensational Trial Is
Promised.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 7.
Miss Jane Hodge will tell from the wit
ness stand next Tuesday the remarkable
story of the matters of love, affection and
separation that have transpired between
her and the wealthy old capitalist, John
Nichol of East Oakland. The case has
| been set for trial, and as all parties are
eager for a determination as to tne legal
value of the sufferings she has sustained,
if any. there will probably be no delay.
Mis's Hodge believes that she is entitled
to $50,000 for her disappointment, Â«tnd Mr.
I Nichol does not believe he ever said any
: thing that could have caused the least
! flutter of anguish in her maidenly heart.
One of the most interesting features of
! the trial will be the argument as to
I whether a man can make a promise of
marriage with a condition, and as to
whether, having made the promise, he can
I urge the dissatisfaction of his daughters
'as a reason for breaking it off. Miss
! Hodge has deposed that Mr. Nichol as
-1 sured her that it would be absolutely im
possible for him to live out the few re
! maining years of his life without her.
, While making these ! professions in a
i buggy on a cold, gloomy day Mr. Nichol,
who is nearly an octogenarian, did not
stipulate that his warm affection was to
be subject to the wishes of his grown
daughters. The old gentleman says that
I it was expressly conditioned and under
| stood even while he was breathing fond
nothings to his sweetheart that it was to
be, as he says in a letter, "all off" if the
daughters disagreed.
Apparently from the matter which has
crept into depositions the daughters were
very far-sighted and philosophical. They
reduced this matter of affection and mar
riage to a cold financial basis and began
j to figure on their respective shares when
: the "Nichol estate should be distributed.
i They hinted at many things that Miss
Jane resented, and it was only after con
'â¢ vincing herself that she had not been
even honorably treated that the lady do
termineil to punish them all by demand
ing $50,000 of their father.
Miss Jane Hodge Is a very entertaining
talker and a very bright woman. Enough
suggestions and hints were drawn out dur
ing the preliminary stages of the suit to
'. show that when put on the witness stand,
where the attorneys are entirely unfet
: tered, her narrative will be more than
1 usually interesting, and possibly some
things" will be told that will indicate that
lovemaking on the part of old folks is
not radically different from the sain? ex
perience when indulged in by younger
generations.
A MYSTERIOUS
HORSELESS CARRIAGE
A Magnificent Six-Seated Affair Be
ing Built With Secrecy for
Charley Fair.
A horseless carriage that will aptonish
the traveling public Is now in course of
construction in this city. It will be a
magnificent six-seated affair and no ex
pense is being spared to make it the
fastest and finest thing of its kind ever
built in America. Tho carriage was to
have been ready for its trial trip from
here to San Mnteo next week, but as
F<>mr> of the parts have to be made over
again it will be a week after that before
it will be seen on the streets and in the
park.
The new horseless carriage is being
built for Charles L. Fair, and George A.
Knight is taking a great interest in the
machine. Great secrecy is being main
tained over the affuir and at least four
shops ;?ru building different parts of the
machine. The Oriental Gas Engine
Works !s making the crank shaft and
igniters; the Union Machine Company is
making the hubs and wheels: the Califor
nia il;is Kr.gine Company is engaged on
other purts. while at least two other shops
are wot king on the body and fittings. The
whole machine is to be put together un
der the supervision of J. M. Ough and
George W;illenbuugh. ami when romplot
, .1 |s expected to be the fastest and finest
thing of the kind ever seen here. In It
Messrs Fair and Knight expect to make

VICIOUS ST. BERNARD
ATTACKS LITTLE CHILD.
OAKLAND, Sept. 7. -Little Walter
Earl Southard, the 6-year-old son
of Mr. and Mrs. Edward South
ard, residing at 835 Franklin
street, was viciously attacked this
afternoon in front of the Reudy Hotel,
opposite the Southard residence, by a
large St. Bernard dog, and the child's
mother Is now living in constant dread
that the little one will become afflicted
with hydrophobia.
According to eye witnesses the child,
who is very fond of animals, wandered
across the street and put his little
arms about the big dog's neck. In
stantly the ferocious animal set upon
the child, imbedding its sharp teeth in
the boy's right arm. His 'screams
brought gueÃts at the hotel and
neighbors to the rescue, and the owner
of the dog soon induced his vicious
canine to let go and follow him. The
owner's name was not learned. He
showed but little concern and promptly
rode away on his horse.

CHANGES WILL TAKE
PLACE AT DEAF INSTITUTE
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 7.
On Saturday afternoon the new board
of directors of the State Deaf and Dumb
and Blind Institute of Berkeley will make
an Informal inspection of the institution.
Next Monday the board will hold a reg
ular meeting, and more than the usual
amount of interest has been expressed
regarding the business that may be trans
acted. Among the State institutions the
Deaf and Dumb and Blind Asylum is
unique, inasmuch as the law creating it
thirty-four years ago has never been
amended and Superintendent Wilkinson,
who was its first superintendent, is still in
absolute control, never having been dis
turbed.
When the legislative committee made
the round of the State institution last
year they observed many things in con
nection with the Berkeley institute which
appeared strange in a State institution
The system of obtaining provisions Is al
together unique in Its way. No bids are
advertised for, the superintendent ac
quainting merchants in a private manner
with the needs of the institution and in
viting them to send prices. They are
opened by the superintendent, who
awards the contracts and then tells the
board what he has done. The directors
apparently have had very little to do but
ratify and approve the actions of the su
perintendent. In the section of the Code
providing for the government of the in
stitution it is stated that if the directors
permit, the superintendent can employ all
the necessary help and teachers. With
the exception of the secretary and pos
sibly the physician the directors have al
lowed the superintendent to have things
his own way.
In many instances it was discovered
that the syptr-m pursued by the superin
tendent was very commendable, inasmuch
as all his contracts for articles whose
prices fluctuated during the year were lot
!>>r very short periods, so that the insti
tute could take advantage of the market.
It is not known whether the new board
Intends to make many changes in the per-
Bonnel of the management, but it is
known that Dr. O. D. Hamlin of this city
has three votes out of the five to appoint
him physician in place of Dr. Ben Wall.
There is likely to be more than one can
didate for the secretaryship. Harrison
i May Is the incumbent, but it is understood
that thorp are two or three others anxious
for the place.
Beyond this nothing has been done
in regard to the patronage. The directors
appear to be of the opinion that Mr. Wil
kinson has run the home very efficiently
and economically, but in accordance with
the recommendations of the legislative
committee they will probably compile and
adopt by-laws governing their actions and
hlso devise a new system for conducting
the domestic portion of the management.
It is understood that the home, which
now contains 2"0 children, is fully up to
the standard of any similar institution In
the country from a scholastic point of
view. But "there is an impression that if
a new man were to succeed the present
superintendent the system of management
now in vogue would not be so economical
or efficient.

A STRANGE DEATH.
Mystery surrounds the death of Charles
Edward Hutchlnson, a local surveyor,
who died on Nineteenth avenue near X

Hutchlnson was employed as a foreman
for the City Street Improvement Com
pany. He was sitting in a temporary

came worse find at 1 o'clock Dr. Quigley

OAKLAND CAN HAVE A
FINE FREE LIBRARY
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 7.
From Sklbo Castle, Scotland, comes
the information that Oakland can have a
beautiful free library building if she will
undertake to provide a place upon which
to build it, and to guarantee that she will
spend the modest sum of $4000 a year In
maintaining it.
A few weeks ago Henry A. Chittenden
a member of the Oakland Tribune staff,
wrote to Andrew Carnegie telling him of
the great need of a library building in
this city. To-day the following reply was
received:
"If Oakland would do as other cities
have done, 1. c., provide a site and agree
to maintain the library at a cost of say
|4000 per year. It would give me pleasure
to give the necessary $50,000 to build it;
bm 1 must be sure that the community is
obliged to maintain it as above. No use
building libraries unless we are sure of
their future."
For many years Oakland has needed a
library building. The city now has a
really valuable library housed in a very
unsafe wooden building near the City
Hall. It has long been a standing joke
that the only thing that has saved the
library building from destruction is the
fact that it adjoins a fire engine station.
In the messages of Mayors for many
years back reference has been made to
the old shack, and a hope has been ex
pressed that sorrething might be done to
Improve matters. The hope has always
ended in disappointment, and although
the lioard of Library Trustees expends
many times the amount named for main
tenance by Mr. Carnegie, nothing has
been done toward providing a more solid
building.
This opportunity to have a $50,000 build-
Ing merely for tlie obtaining of a site, is
one that will undoubtedly commend itself
to the citizens, for the library Is ready to
move into it, and under the law governing
such matters Oakland has permanently
decided to maintain a free public library.
and for its maintenance a regular amount
must be put In each year's tax levy.
"I have not had an opportunity yet to
examine into this matter," said the
Mayor, "but if it is as good as it appears
tn be. it is something that the city should
at once take advantage of. Really, within
a week we should be able to notify Mr.
Carnegie that the site is ready and he
can send his check to the Free Library
Trustees."
COACH COCHRAN NOW ON
HIS WAY TO BERKELEY
BERKELEY, Sept. 7.â Late this even
ing a telegram was received from Silver
<'ity, N(W Mexico, stating that Coach
Garret Cochran had left there this after
noon and would arrive In Berkeley next
Monday, September 11.
The telegram came to Football Manager
Irwin J. Muma. As the big coach was
not expected till the 15th of this month,
the news of his intended early arrival is
received with much satisfaction by the
students. There is likely to be something
unique in the line of college demonstra
tion as Boon as the gridiron veteran
reaches the university town. Prepara
tions for the evr-nt are now in progrrss.
and it will be of such a character as to
start the season going with an outburst
of enthusiasm far above anything which
hns b^en seen here before.
Cochran is expected to turn out upon
the football field the evening after his ar
rival. With the assistance of Kelly of
Princeton, who accompanies him, he
will start in immediately with the Varsity
team, which is to meet Stanford at the
next Thanksgiving game. The freshman
team will receive some share of attention
at the beginning, as their match with the
cardinal freshmen is scheduled as one of
the first games of the season. The college
men expect to organize a rooters' olu!>
similar to that of last year to lead In the
yelling and cheering.

HIS HYPNOTIC
POWER HOLDING
LENA RENNER
Arlington Is a Modern
Svengali.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
Broadway, Sept. 7.
Behind the gray walls and iron bars of
the Alameda County Jail there languishes
a hynotist whose powers almost rival
those attributed to the fictitious Svengall.
He is none other than Arthur Arlington,
the arch bunkoer of unsuspecting women,
whose nefarious transactions and his re
cent conviction on a charge of robbing a
woman named Mrs. M. M. Smith, who
dared to throw aside all dreads of notor
iety and prosecute him. have been full/
exploited in The Call heretofore.
His unfortunate Trilby, the heart-brok
en woman whose friendship for this hyp
notist through his past seven years'
checkered career has never once wavered
and who is now p. nniless and all but
.starving because Bhe has given her all
to this arch deceiver and gay Lothario, i 3
Lena Renner.
The story of how she met Arlington at
Lob Angeles seven years ago; how he
suddenly departed with another woman,
going to San Francisco; and how l.< :â  t,
rtenner afterward also moved to Ban
Francisco, where Arlington soon hunted,
her up, were told by this unfortunate
woman in last Tuesday's > all. In an in
terview at that time Lena Benner said
that she was no longer deceived; shÂ«
had realized her awful misplaced
dence in this ex-convict and shÂ« stated
that she Intended leaving her h^me on
Larkin street, San Francisco, to return to
her relatives In New i'ork.
But a letter received by her from Ar
lington has changed all plans and the
fact of the powerful hypnotic influence
exercised over her by this modern Sven
gall was disclosed to-day through a
visit paid Arlington by a stranger from
San Francisco, who did not make Known
his name, but who announced that lie
wished to hold council with the prisoner
on extremely important business.
"1 came over here," said tnia stranger
afterward, "to try and induce this mar.
Arlington to let go his hold, whati ver It
be on this woman, Lena rtenner.
had made up her mind to return to her
folks In New York, and a first class ticket
had already been purchased fur her; but
she has since received a letter from Ar
lington wherein he professes his inno
cence and imploring her not to desert him.
now: that he would soon be free again.
'1 he 'power he exercises over her is mar
velous. It is hypnotism and and nothing
less.
"1 implored Arlington to sit down and
write to Lena Renner a letter advising her
to return to her old home and friends In
New York, but he stolidly refused, and
I've given it up as a bad job. 1 do not
know what to do."
It was afterward learned that Lena
Rc-nner's true name is Goodman, and her
relatives back in New York are wealthy
and prosperous business people, and that
the stranger who called on Arlington to
day Is their Pacific Coast representative.
It "appears that for years the Goodmans
had lost all trace of Lena, and only re
cently, while the Arions were out here m
their jubilations, was she recognized by
tine of their number, when her people
were promptly notified. A check was for
warded to the Goodmans' agent here and
a ticket purchased for Lena Goodman's
return Now Arlington is all that holds
her, and she refuses to believe him a cruel
heart-breaker. How Arlington has man
aged to get a letter to her is beyond the
ken of the jailers, for they have stead
fastly refused to allow the arch bunkoer
to send letters through the regular chan
nels and Lena has. moreover, been denied
the privilege of visiting the hypnotist in
the t'nunty Jail.
"If Mr. Arlington had told me I should
return to my folks I would gladly go." Is
all the satisfaction the agent ran get from
her since she- changed her mind, and this
the hypnotist refuses to advise her.
In a few days Arlington will appear in
court for sentence. Less than ten years
he cannot get in view of prior convictions,
and the law allows life sentence to be im
pos >d 'n his case.
NEVER MARRY TWICE
SAYS BIGAMIST WOLF
OAKLAND, Sept. 7.â Charles Wolf, the
alleged bigamist, who has been meditating
over his defense in the County Jail await
ing his trial in the Superior Court, h;:s
without solicitation admitted his guilt in
black and white in a communication
wherein he tells of his readiness now to
talk fur publication. Following is an ex
cerpt from his manuscript:
Now If the people really knew my condition
they would do as I did 'but not to marry the
second one and get b Iked the eecond lime).
The reason that I married her was through a
tei'der heiirt. but it got me where 1 am to
day. She told me that ehe was maltreated, by
her first husband, and I told her of my ex
perience in the East. V.'c were married and
â¢.-.-pre getting; along very nicely until some one
came between us, and then she left me. â¢ â¢ â¢
Now I know I have done wrong and regret it
with all my heart,- for I must stand the con
sequences of my wrongdoing. â¢ â¢ â¢ Now
these two women have been my downfall thus
far, but I'm hoping I shall build myself up
Benin with the help of my Savior.

SILVER WANTS
GOLD FROM THE
FAIR MANAGERS
Filipino Exhibit Is the
Bone of Contention.
CONTRACT CAUSED TROUBLE
MECHANICS' INSTITUTE AGENT
EXCEEDED INSTRUCTIONS.
A Misunderstanding About Curios
That Was Brought About by a
Mix-Up of Representa
tives.
W. B." Silver, who is known in this city
fr -m the fact that he has brought here a
\ collection of Philippine curios for exhi
bition at the Mechanics' Fair, threatens
6uit against the Mechanics' Institute. The
amount that he will sue for is not men
tioned by either Mr. Sliver or his at
tornpy, Rofco, S. Gray, but both say that
it will be many thousand dollars. The
threatened litigation has for its origin
instructions which seem to have been dif
ferently interpreted.
When it was decided that a Philippine
exhibit would increase the attractions of
the Mechanics' Fair the trustees of the
instit'U" communicated with Lieutenant
Perry Hayne of Battery A, California
Heavy Artillery concerning the exhibit.
But, before Lieutenant Hayne had con
cluded any arrangement, hostilities be
tween the Filipinos and the United States
began and Lieutenant Hayne was ordered
to proceed to the front.
He Informed Colonel Deplcke, president
I of the Mechanics" institute, of that fact
j and expressed the opinion that the hostil
' Itles would render the exhibit impossible.
Joseph M. Cummings, secretary of the
j institute, wrote then to Lieutenant Hayne
i asking him to do the best he could even
if it could not be on the lines originally
planned. Colonel E>etiieke also wrote, sub
sequently, to Lieutenant Hayne, mention-
I ing the fact that W. P. Thomas had been
I requested to call upon the officer and of
! fer his assistance. In conclusion Colonel
i Denicke wrote that if Lieutenant Hayne
I had need for such assistance as Mr.
i Thomas could offer he need not hesitate
i to avail himself of it.
Lieutenant Hayne. to make a short
story of it, turned the business over to
Mr. Thomas ot making the deal with Mr.
Silver, who had a collection of curios. Mr.
! Thomas entered into a contract with Mr.
j Silver, which contract was drawn up uy
O. F. Williams, then the United States
Consul at Manila. According to Mr.
Gray, Mr. Silvers attorney, this provided
that Silver should receive $'*> per month
from the time he left Manila until Oc
tober 7, 1899, the date of closing the fair,
or SlS*' in total; also free transportation
for himself and his goods from Manila to
San Francisco and return: also that the
I trustees of the institute should pay the
"godown," or warehouse, charges in Ma-
I nila; also that Silver and his goods should
â¢ be brought to tire United States upon a
transport; that space was to be given in
the fair tor the exhibition of the goods;
that the institute should pay all customs
duties on the curios imported to the
United States, and provided also for Lie
sale of the curios at tlie fair, limiting the
sale to such articles as Silver had in dupli
cate, the purpose being to keep the col
lection Intact for exhibition purposes;
finally that, at the close of the fair, the
curios should be transported at the cost
of the trustees, to Cleveland, Ohio.
A trustee of the Mechanics' Institute,
speaking for the board of trustees, made
this statement last evening: "We In
structed our agent, Perry Hayne, at
Manila, to make an arrangement with
Silver to give Silver free transportation
for himself and his goods to San Fran
' Cisco. We wire to place them in the fair,
I where they would be favorably exhibited
; t.j in> sold. For this service the institute
was to receive 2i per cent of the sales.
On accouni of his military duties Lieuten
ant Hayne turned the matter over to Mr.
Thomas. When Mr. Silver finally arrived
here, we found that he had an agreement
which went far in excess of the Instruc
tions given by usâ giving Silver a salary;
i obliging us to pay customs duties, and
I also to pay for transporting the goods to
Cleveland, Ohio. We cannot carry out
the terms of thai agreement for they
were not authorized.
Mr. Silver said lasH evening that- he
wuld sue the Institute to recover on the
following items: Jl'rO and also the' cost of
transporting the goods back to Manila;
the cost Of transporting the goods to
Cleveland, <>liio, which will be between
(200 and W00; the customs duties at San
Francisco, which will amount to $200 to
$300; alsoâ and this will be the biggest
itemâ for loss on the expected sale of his
goods here, he claiming that the goods
have been sent back- to the unclaimed
warehouse and so cannot be sold. This
is the item that will call for thousands of
dollars.
Mr. Silver claims to have copies of the
letters sent by th<* president and secre
tary of the institute to. Lieutenant Hayne
and he relies largely on them to make his
claim good. Until late yesterday after
noon there was a good chance that the
controversy would be settled out of court.
Then the attorneys had a tlnal interview.
i at the end of which Mr. Gray announced
i that suit will be brought.
NO MORE TERM DEPOSITS.
German Savings and Loan Society
Decides to Abolish Tnem.
The German Savings and Loan Society
is Bending circulars to Its depositors j
notifying them of the adoption of an
amendment to the by-laws regarding de- j
[HisitH and dividends. Tlie amendment
provides that on and after the 31st day j
of December, 1*99. the division of the de- j
positfl into the two classes heretofore deÂ» â¢ j
Ignated as "ordinary" and "term" sha\'
be abolished and all deposits on hand ok j
aald day or thereafter made shall form
one class upon which a uniform rate of |
dividend shall thereafter be declared and
paid.
Deposits Fhall not be taken for any
specific term nor shall any notice In
writing or otherwise be required of de
positors before demanding reimbursement
of their deposits.
Thin step is necessitated by the low
rate of interest now exacted upon loans j
and the enormous amount of money now !
in the bank's coffers. Under the original j
by-laws It was provided that in declar- |
trig dividends at least one-fifth more
should be paid upon term deposits than j
upon ordinary deposits. In consideration !
of this preference the hoiders of term
deposits were required to give six months'
notice before demanding repayment of
any portion of their deposits. In default
of such notice sixty days' interest was i
forfeited and this was recently increased '
to ninety days.
Under the amended by-laws, which will I
come into operation after December 31, [
1899, there will be a uniform nite of div
idend applicable to all deposits alike and !
the six months' notice formerly required
from term depositors will be abrogated.
No transfer of account or change of bank
books will be nec< ssary.
SUNDAY'S CALL can be pur-
chased from all agents and
newsdealers at 5c per copy.

FRANEY'S DEATH
DUE TO SHOCK
AND EXHAUSTION
Pugilists in the Police
Court.
TESTIMONY OF MEDICAL MEN
OPINIONS OF THE MASTER OF
CEREMONIES.
Frank McConnell's Preliminary Ex
amination on the Charge of
Manslaughter Corn^
menced.
Judge Oonlnn's court was filled yester
day with pugilists and men interested in
the manly art when Frank H. McConnell
appeared for his preliminary examination
on the charge of manslaughter in causing
the death of "Jim" Franey at Wood
ward's Pavilion on the night of August lt>.
A large number of witnesses were ex
amined, including several medical men.
but there was nothing definite brought
out to show that Franey's death was any
thing,but the result of accident.
Dr. G. J. Fitzgibbon- testified that he
attended Franey in the Receivng Hospital
and found Him in a dying condition from
compression of the brain due to cerebral
hemorrhage. Dr. John D. Kergan testi
fied to the same effect. Dr. D. D. Lustig
testified that he examined Franey at th<>
Pavilion prior to the fight and found him
In an absolutely perfect physical condi
tion.
Dr. Charles K. Jones was at the Pa
vilion and saw the fight. In the four
teenth round Franey received the knock
out blow and was rendered senseless. Ho
thought the blow was a right uppercut on
the jaw. Attorney John J. Barrett saw
the hght. Franey was fighting vigorously,
but just in a moment witness saw him
hanging helpless with his arms against
the ropes. Tht>n he received the knock
out blow. Prentice Clarkson thought
the fight was even up to the fourteenth
round, and it looked as if Franey was the
stronger of the two. He did not see the
knock-out blow struck, but saw Franey
go up against the ropes and then fall on
the floor.
"Billy"' Jordan, the master of ceremo
nies, testified that one of the articles of
agreement was" that the men were to
break away clean, but Franey objected
and wanted to fight in the clinches. Mc-
Connell had signed the articles to break
away clean, because he had given Franey
ten pounds the best in the weight. After
a wrangle they agreed to break away
clean, but Franey kept punching McCon
nell in the clinches ana McConnell was
compelled to do the snme. Where Franey
fell resin had been sprinkled on the floor,
and also water used in* bathing the man
In that corner, and a sort of crust had
formed. He thought that Franey's head
striking on this hardened crust was chiefly
the cause of his death.
C. H. Westphal and E. F. Burns testi
fied that the fight did not differ from the
amateur contests at the Olympic Club.
Sol Levinson, who made the gloves used
in the fight, testified that they were a
little heavier than the regulation weight
of five ounces. They weighed very nearly
six ounces.
Dr. Zabala, the autopsy physician, testi
fied to making the autcfpsy on Fran< y'a
body and that ho died from shock follow
ing the Injuries received. On examining
the organs he found pleurettc adhesion "i"
the lungs. He did not know of any spe
cial lesion that might be mentioned. As
to Franey's physical condition, he was
unable to describe it without his book,
and he was asked to bring it when the
case was next called. Dr. D. F. Regan,
ex-School Director, testified that he saw
Franey before his death and also att< nded
the autopsy.' He was satisfied that death
was caused by shock and exhaustion.
Policemen Taylor and Riehl cave un
important testimony and the case was
continued till Tuesday afternoon. All the
other cases were also continued till then.
PHILBROOK'S PLEA DENIED
Supreme Court Refuses to Allow Him
to Resume Practice.
The application of Horace W. Phil
brook, the disbarred attorney, to be re
instated as a practitioner of the law (n
; the State courts has been of no avail.
j Five years ago the Supreme Court de-
I cided that he was no credit to the pro
; fesfion nnd the judgment was his disbar
| mont. Last January Philbrook made ap
plication to have the judgment set aside,
â  but the matter was decided adverse to
j him then. A short time ago he again
asked to have the motion reheard, and
in support of his position made ready
with a lengthy brief, in which he assailed
court, attorneys and Individuals in very
spiteful language. This was never Hied
with the clerk of tne court, but last
Tuesday he made an ex parte motion to
be heard.
This was taken under advisement and
yesterday the court in bank handed down
| a decision in which the Justices "turned
i down" the ex-attorney for keeps. Justice
Harrison, who to a great extent was the
cause of Philbrook's disbarment, did not
j participate in the order of denial.

CURED BY CUTICURA
My little boy was two years old when he
reached upon the table and spilled a cup of
hot coffee all over his left hand. It had gone |
through to his breast, and before I could re- ;
move his clothes it had burned his breast, '
and the skin came off with the clothes, and
be has to-day a scar as large as a silver dollar
en his breast. I applied a great many things.
The burn was a very ugly one, hard to. heal.
I was requested to try Cr/TiccÃA (ointment), j
â which healed up rapidly, but before I used a
half a box of Ccticcra it was well. Oh, I |
think Ccticcha is the salve above all others.

Congressman Gamble of South
Dakota at the Palace.
By making a record breaking trip of
fourteen days across the Pacific from
Yokohama, the Sheridan upset the calcu
lations of the delegations from Minnesota
and South Dakota, who started from
their homes to come here and receive the
volunteers she is bringing home.
The Minnesota delegation, consisting of
Governor John D. Lind and a large parly
of State officials, are scheduled to arrive
at the Occidental on Monday next, and
the South Dakota delegation, which is to
reach the Palace this evening, had only
one representative here last night to meet
the boys on their return from the wars.
This single delegate is Congressman R. J.
Gamble, who is accompanied by his wife
and son.
When Been last evening Congressman
' Gamble said that a great deal of money
had been collected throughout his State
to entertain the men who had sacrificed
so much for their flag. But, as tho defln

which Is to welcome the soldiers to their

trouble on the night of February 4 to the capture of Calumpit on Zi
April 25 they bore most gallantly tholr full part in the very ?Z
forefront of the American advance, aa is well attested by the official casualty
returns from every' one of the many hard-fought fields by which Mac-Arthur
won bis way from Taloocan to the Rio Grande River. Beginning with the 5?
fighting at Binaldo Church, between Santa Mesa and Caloocan, on February â¢*
5 and G, when they lost Beven men killed and eight wounded, every field Q
added to their honored roll of kllli i 1 and wounded, until the former numbers >/
llfty-eight and the latter eigrhty-nine men.
They Buffered most severel.s' i:i the engagements incident to the beginning X
M.-uArthUr's advance toward Malolop. February 24 and 25. When between V
i an and Palo they lost twelve m<-n killed and thirty-three wounded; ;ui<l v
Hale's advance alonn tlie north side of the river from Ouingua to Calum- '*
pit and the capture of the latter place, when their list of casualties was Q

c!sco for Manila. The first detachment, consisting of two battalions, sailed A
on July 2", on the transport Rio Janeiro, and .the remainder followed on the V
St. Paul. July 29. Though coming from a country of extreme cold, where the &
blizzard often dragged the mercury down to 66 degrees below zero, tTlese â¢?
hardy, brave hearted boys endured the extreme heat incident to their passage Q
across the Pacific without serious hurt and without a murmur of discontent, i?<
and so did they all the hardships of their camping and campaigning under a X
sweltering heat, in the fever infested flelds and swamps of Luzon. A

SHAFTER TO BE RETAINED
Adjutant General Corbin Says
He Will Not Retire as a
Volunteer Officer.
From dispatches from "Washington it
would seem as if the President intends
to reward General Rhaftcr for his work
in Cuba by continuing: him in service as
a major general of volunteers after the
time for his retirement as a brigadier
general in tf>e regular establishment
shall have arrived.
Under ordinary circumstances General
Shatter would retire on October 1G next,
the day he Is 64 years old. This is the
law, but the age provision has not been
carried Into the volunteer service and
General Shaftor is a major ponfrnl of
volunteers; and as a major general of
volunteers he will in all probability he
retained in command of this department.
The following dispatch to The Call
from Washington will explain the situa
tion mom" fully than the one published
last Wednesday morning:
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING

It has been practically decided that Gen

GALLANT MINNESOTA'S
SPLENDID WAR RECORD
IV
1$ f â  \IIK Thirteenth Mlnnpsota Regiment SRiled from San Francisco for the
'i \ Philippines on the City of Para with the third military expedition on
Q i June 27, IS9S. Though half of the regiment were recruits of but six
jr \ weeks' training, when they arrived at Cavite they soon proved that
ft -*â  they were something more than exhibition soldiers. In the assault and
x ( apture of the city of Manila on August 13 this gallant regiment led one of
V the columns in the advance on the Spanish works, and though twenty-six of
j< their number fell, three of whom were killed or mortally wounded, there was
?i no halt or falter with them until the sight of the Stars and Stripes floating
A over the walled city announced the surrender of the foe.
}. A well-merited tribute to the good discipline of this regiment was its se
?Z lection for provost duty in the city when the attitude of the Filipinos be
s gan to indicate trouble. They were employed on this duty, under the d'irec-
Q tion of General Hughes when the outbreak came on the night of February
ft" 4. and in the trying scenes of the three days and nights that followed they ',
?2 proved themselves tactful, vigilant and brave.
A Soon after the regiment was sent to the front, and from that time
7/ on until the end of May they were on continuous duty, picketing.
ft inarching â  fighting, and the roll of dead and wounded bears good evidence 'â 
A of how faithfully they stuck to their work. On February 22, in the engage
s' lent before Malabon, they lost in a very short time two men killed and ten ;
>Z wounded, but they cleared everything before them. <
*f On the rebrigadmg of the regiments, March 19, they were assigned to '.
Q Hall's brigade of Mac Arthur's division, and took part in the long stretch â 
ti of fighting of March 24 to 27, from Malabon to Miralao, in which they lost <
<t three men killed and twelve wounded. On April 10, while in reserve at '
Q Miralao, they repulsed an attempt by a large force of the enemy to break (
X Mac Arthur's line of communication with Manila, losing three men killed and i
7Z fifteen wounded. Their conduct on this occasion was that of veteran soldiers ;
A and earned official mention. "When General La- 1 -ton's flying column was /
V, started from Novaliches northward the Thirteenth Minnesota with the Sec- 1
ft und Oregon marched from Miralao and Bocave and joined him near Marun- 3
A co. From that time on- tiir the capture of San Isidro and return therefrom
L they remained under hi? command, taking part in the' various fights at (
# p.alinag, Mansin, San Miguel and San Ildefonso, with a loss of seven men I
yi killed and afteen wounded, among the former being their brave and much- )
/) lamented major, Ar..iur M. Diggles, who was killed by .1 Filipino sharp- (
Y. shooter on May 8 at Balinag. â  j
>Z The full death roll of the regiment numbered fifty-two and of the )
Â£ wounded seventy-five when embarked for home.
