CONVENTION HALL. ZANES
VILLE. Â«>hin. Aug. 30.â The
-ratic Ptate Convention
closed to-day, after a day of
dramatic plays. While there were
half a dozer, other candidates for Gov
ernor, the McLean men claimed every
thing -with such confidence that they
magnanimous in minor I
parts, although they were at the same (
time careful that the star candidate
was â¢ 1. They stated early in
the day that the first ballot would have
of "the second choice" vote for
M' Lean, that none of the reserves

lot, and that all the candidates would
have their res] >n the first
In this play McLean was nomi

the figuring was so close that the!
dran hanges on the sec-!
..iid ballot with "second choice" re
kins to Mi-Lean's standard i
did not takr- place. It isclaimed McLean ;

and that he would have had over

ij short of enough to
â¢.ate. Among the shrewdest plays

named in the report of the sergeant-at- |
arms.
The convention much of the time was
i control of the sergeant-at-arms
and his assistant*.
The convention was properly repre
sented in its platform and its key note
h of Judg.- Mooney. The name of
n was cheered whenever it was
mentioned. The convention showed
demonstrations over free silver and
:alism. anti-bossism and all the
tments In the. hi h of Judge;
Mooney and in the platform. The re
from 8 to 4 p. m. was taken to con
fer with Judge Kilburne for second
on the ticket, and the recess was
continued in vain till ."> p. m. for that
When the convention rear- j
ed there were efforts to nominate
Kilburne notwithstanding his repeated I
declinations, and his friends withdrew j
his name as fast as the McLean men j
â¢ :ite<j it.
Memorial Hall was packed_when Hon. j
S. Thomas, chairman of the Demo
cratic State Committee, called the State
to order. Very many were
unable to gain admittance. The decora
tions were elaborate. Over the stage
wa.s a life-sized portrait of Bryan and |
others were plumed throughout the hall.!
penlng prayer was by Rev. L. F.
Kearney, Cathotfc. He prayed for the
ranee <>f the Filipinos from the

was amended so as to make permanent
the temporary organization. This contm

as well as Judge Mooney as chairman,

! power to adopt. This rejKirt was adopt
ed. Then the counties were called Cor
nominations for Governor, and much ttme
was devoted to speeches In presenting
the names. No reosM was taken. The
names of ex-Mayor James A. Rice of
; Canton and Hon. Charles N. Haskell of
' Ottawa were presented. General A. J.
I Warner presented the name of Colonel
James Kilbourne of Columbus In a most
vigorous speech, and it wa.s seconded
equally vigorously by Judge. A. W. Pat
rick.
When Dr. James A. Norton, member of
Congress for the Tiffin district, rose to
present the name of John R. McLean of
Cincinnati there was a great demonstra
tion which was met by hisses. Norton
replied to both demonstrations, espe
cially to the "threats and abuse" in the
preceding speech of General Warner. Dr.
Norton's speech was followed by another
demonstration, and then the nam.-s of
I General Isaac R. Sherwood of Toledo and
Jim- s E Beward of Mansfield were pre-
McLean was nominated on the
' first ballot, receiving 402 Vi votes, and Kil

There was such a demonstration after
the nomination of McLean was known to
have been secured that the secretary

that Colonel Kilbourne would decline
this effort was abandoned. During thfs
part of the performance the committee
appeared, escorting the nominee for

ovation. He thanked the convention for
the honor and said he would make as

SIX LIVES
LOST IN A
YUMA FIRE
Men Fighting the
Blaze Are Crushed
by the Falling of an
Upper Floor.
It Is Believed the Bodies
of Other Victims Will
Be Found in the Ruins
of the Biiilding.
â â¦ â
Special r>is=ivuteh to The Call.
YUMA, Ariz^Aug. 30.â Six homes
in Tuma rfPj shrouded In deep
est sorrow to-night, the result of
a disastroi '; fire this - morning
ihich totally -lestroyed E. F. San
gulnetti's mercantile.- establishment,
one of the lare^s' wholesale and retail
stores in Arizona The fire . -was dis
covered at 3 o'clock this morning In the
j second story of th k . building, which was
used as a storerc, m, and had gained
such headway th?.. the Volunteer Fire
Department was enable to cope with
it. Five strong streams of water
, played upon the turning building tor
several hours, but o no avail.
The massive building finally went
down in a shapelesjj heap of ruins, car
rying with it the liven of six brave men
I who risked their all to save the prop
i erty of a friend. When the great crowd
of m<;n which gathered at the scene of
! destruction realized- that the fight 10
save the building was a hopeless one
I they bf gan to carry out goods from the
; lower floor. The work of saving goods
had scarcely begun when the tocond
, floor, where an Immense quantity of
; merchandise was stored, came down
| with a crash upon the helpless victims.
At least twenty-flvf men were in the
store when the building gave way, and
; the escape of all but six with only
slight injuries was pimply miraculous.
The known dead are:
CITY COUNCILMAN H. F. NEAIIR.
JAMES TAPIA.
RODOLFO WILSOV, j ,-
JULIAN PREci.a ' Â. { i M- : G
KLTI'S RIVERA; '-" 'â >Â«,,-
RICHARD WILSON.
The first five were killed outright and
burled beneath .the burning debris.
; Richard Wilson was able to get out of
I the building with the assistance of
! friends, but only lived a few hours.
As soon as the walls of the building
fell in a large force of men began the
wcrk of rescuing the bodies of the un
fortunate men. When night overtook
the earnest toilers the charred remains
of Neahr, Rivera and Preciado had
been recovered. The work of finding
the bodies was very difficult owing to
the great quantity of water in the base
ment. A gasoline engine is pumping
out the water, and the remaining vic
tims will probably be recovered in the
morning.
It Is thought by many that at least
four unknown men are buried in the
I debris. The town has many strangers,
and some who were seen carrying out
goods are supposed to have gone down.
This belief can only be verified by a
thorough search among the ruins.
The funeral of the men recovered will
take place to-morrow. The town is in
deep sorrow. The men were all born
and raised here.
Mr. Sanguinetti's loss Is $100,000. with
$40,000 insurance. The building be
longed to John Gandolfo, a former
partner of Sanguinettl, and cost $16,
--000. It was insured for $12,500. Sangui
netti is one of the brightest young
I business men in the Territory and feels
the loss severely, but will immediately
engage in business again.
MUTINY ABOARD
THE CITY OF PARA
One Thousand Discharged Soldiers
Held in Subjection by Armed
Guards.
CHICAGO. Aug. 30.â The Chicago
Record's copyrighted cable from Ma
nila says: One thousand discharged
soldiers, who are on the transport City
of Para, are being held in submission
to-day by armed guards, consisting of
a company of the signal corps.
The discharged soldiers threaten
to mutiny because their officers
have ordered them to police
their quarters and to perform other
duties on board ship which have been
required of enlisted men.
The soldiers claim they are no longer
in the United States service, and in
sist that they have all the rights of
regular passengers while aboard the
transport.
When the officers first gave the or
ders which caused the trouble, the men
became so demonstrative that the Sig
nal Corps's company was armed im
mediately and placed on guard.
The officers of the guard have been
instructed to carry out the orders re
garding discharged men working while
aboard the transport and serious
trouble is liable to break out any mo
ment. The discharged soldiers are not
allowed the freedom of the ship.
The officers Insist the men shall do

FRANK IVES IS
CALLED BY DEATH
Noted Billiard Expert
Summoned.
Special Plfpatrh to The Cull.
PROGRESSO, Mex.. Aug. 30.â Frank
Ives, the famous American billlardist,
who' came here several days ago in
search of relief from consumption, died
to-day. His body will be taken to Chi
cago for burial.
CHICAGO. Aug. 30.â Frank C. Ives was
the world over regarded as a Chicago
man and it was hero he first achieved
fame In his chosen profession and where
he spent the greater portion of his short
life
He was bom in Plainwell. Mich.. Oc
tober 5 I^6, and first attracted attention
as a billiard and pool player when S years
of age He entered on a public career as
a billlardist in 1888, and finished fifth in a
tournament, after which he entered the
employ of "Student" Slosson as profes
sional" billiardist.
On April 29. IMC, Ives and Tarter met for
the championship, Ivea winning. The same
year he defeated Schaefer. Slosson chal
lenged the winner and was In turn de
feated by the "Young Napoleon," SOO to
488.
Ives forfeited the championship emblem
in 1893. The following November he was
defeated by Schaefer in a 4000-point
match, but they divided honors In Janu
ary, UM. In January. IS9B. came the tour
nament in this city, in which Ives and
Schaefer again divided honors.
This practically enaed his c.-ireer as a
public performer, and since that time the
public stems to have lost Interest in the
"gentleman's game." At any rate none of
It? prese-nt exponents have ability to
draw the crowds which used to fill the
largest halls to nee fves play. Ives for a
number of years conducted one of th
largest billiard-rooms in the world in Chi
cago, and such was his popularity and
business shrewdness that he amassed a
competence. In lWfi hp began to give evi
dence of being afflicted with the malady
which to-day claimed him for a victim
and he spared neither effort nor expense
in his battle for life.
STREET CAR BLOWN
UP IN CLEVELAND
Five of the Six Passengers Sustain
Broken Legs.
CLEVELAND, Aug. 30.â A combina
tion car on the Willison avenue line
was blown up by a powerful explosive
between Scoville and Quincy streets to
night at 9:30. There were six pas
sengers on board, five of whom sus
tained broken legs. The other passen
ger and the crew of the car escaped
without injury.
The explosion lifted the car entirely
off the track, destroying the trucks and
demolishing the flooring. The car fell
again on the trucks and in such a way
as to imprison the injured passengers.
These were rescued by the crew of the
car. The report of the explosion was
heard on the public square, three miles
from the scene. There is no clew to the
perpetrators of the disaster. J

Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENNES, Aug. 30.â The air. of
Rennes this evening is filled with
rumors of conspiracies and pre
dictions of coups de theatre, but
nothing precise can be ascer
tained. General Mercier's attitude dur
ing the last few days has mystified his
followers in the case. He is extremely
clever and the general feeling Is that
he is preparing something, the existence
of which will be revealed in a few days.
It is now accepted as beyond ques
tion that there is a serious division of
opinion on the part of the generals.
While the case was running smoothly
against Captain Dreyfus they all pulled
together, but since the tide of evidence
began to turn in his favor, as was not
ably the case during the testimony of
Captain Freysmetter and Colonel Cor
dier, which proved much more damag
ing to the general staff than the latter
expected, certain dividing lines have
become manifest between the various
cliques.
General Roget, Major L,auth. Captain
Cuignet and M. Gribelin, the principal
keeper of the archives of the War Of
ice, for .1 one eot;!ie; General MercJei
and General Gonse form another and
General Billot and General de Bois
deffre a third. According to one report
the first two coteries intend to throw
over General de Boisdeffre, whom they
feel to be faltering, and declare that
! he is responsible for all the errors and
illegalities of the court-martial of 1594,
â  thus making him the scapegoat. Ac
cording to another report General Ro-
I get, who was not implicated in 1594 and
who fought against Dreyfus because he
inherited from his predecessors the re
sponsibility tor so doing and placed
over-confidence in the accuracy of the
; matter furnished him by the general
staff, will cut himself loose from Gen
erals Mercier, Gonse and De Boisdeffre.
This Is a plausible hypothesis, since
! Roget has assumed throughout the role
i of the defender of the army, thus mak
ing himself popular with the army and
with a large section of the nation, and
he probably would not lose by separat
i ing himself from the wrongdoers of
1894 and declaring that his opinion had
been changed by the evidence given
! during the present trial. Yet another
story is that the generals are going to
give way to the authorship of the bor
dereau in view of the strong evidence
and will admit that Esterhazy wrote it.
alleging, however, that Dreyfus fur
nished the information, not direct to
Esterhazy, but to a third person, who
acted as intermediary without Dreyfus
knowing Esterhazy.
In this connection it was asserted this
afternoon that lime. Rastian. who was
housekeeper for Colonel Schwarzkop
pen, the German military attache, in
I 1.891, and who is understood to have
, acted as a French spy, has been seen
in Rennes and will be summoned as a
witness concerning Sehwarzkoppen's
espionage system.
These rumors may be without foun
dation, but in any event they are
symptomatic of the feeling in Rennes
that something is going on under the
; surface and that the complexion of the
trial may be altered by some coup at
any moment.
In the matter of evidence, to-day was
; quite a Dreyfus day, only the deposi
tion of the last witness. General de
j Loye, being unfavorable. The testi
j mony of M. Picot, a member of the in
j stitute, is little likely, however, to serve
I the cause of the accused materially, if
'' at all, because his introduction of Col
! onel Schneider, the Austrian military
attache, as a champion of Dreyfus was
.rather calculated to arouse resentment
and adversely to influence the judges,
especially as it was followed by Gen
! eral Roget's tactful protest against
Colonel Schneider's complimentary al
lusions to French officers.
To-morrow's proceedings behind
closed doors will deal with the question
whether Captain Dreyfus was in a po
sition to divulge the information re
' garding the artillery which was prom
ised in the bordereau. The session will
, be very important and is bound to have
! a tremendous influence upon the Judges
I one way or the other, because they are
all artillery officers and will be able
i to appreciate such evidence better than
the cryptographic intricacies that have
j been laid before them by the handwrit
| ing experts.
The Dreyfusards express confidence
! that their artillery witnesses. Major
I Hartman and Major Ducros, will ef-
f ectively satisfy the judges that Drey
: fus was ignorant of the matters men
tioned in the bordereau, or as an artil
lery officer would not have been guilty
of stating the errors which it contained.

before the Court of Cassation, relating to

reply; made a really clear statement; ex- j
plaining that he saw the hydro-pneumatic i
brake once at Bourgea once at the School <
of War. and that he ntver saw it used >
because, while on the general staff, lie i
way never present at tiring practice. j
Major Carriere then made application;
to have the court sit behind closed doors !
to-morrow; explaining that he desired to
sifbmit to the court certain documents
prepared by the gunnery bureau, contain
ing information which it was not desirable
to discuss in public. In court, after de- j
liberation, granted the application and j
also acceded to the request of the de- :
fer.se that their witness. Major Hart- \
rnanti of the artillery, be allowed to be i
present, as he would give Important i
testimony; showing â  hat Dreyfus could !
not have written the paragraphs in the j
bordereau concerning artillery.
Following ujv the more Important pro
ceedings in detail:
The nisi witness to-day, M. Paul Meyer,
member of the institute and director of
the School of 'Ancient Manuscripts, j
described -his researches In i.:- Dreyfus i
crt>>e which led to hJs^convictlon that me j
bordereau was not only in : : : rbazy's :
].;.!,.h\ ritinp. but was actually written by '
BSterhazy. The witness explained that <
in his evidence before the Assizes Court j
he was unable to be so positive in regard !
t-j the writer because he had only seen [
a fac simile of the bordereau, but at the !
Court of Cassation he saw the original.
"I convinced myself," said M. Meyer, '
"by a magnify]] glass that the border
eau was written In a free hand and with- i
out hesitation; whereas It is precisely :
hesitation in the formation of strokes that I
reveals the method of tracing. 1 can â 
..;!'.: m that It Is In the writing and in the i
very hand of . â¢ rhazy. This Is perfectly
clear to me." (Commotion.)
At the conclusion of his testimony the j
Witness gave a demonstration of the fal
lacy of the Bertillon system.
Professor Auguste " Molinier of the I
School of Anci' nt Manuscripts gave sim- !
liar evidence. He said thai each fresh'
examination of the bordereau only served \
to further convince him that it "was the j
work of Esterhazy. Amid deep attention !
the witness demonstrated how the con- I
elusions of the experts who attributed the j
bordereau to Dreyfus were mutually de
structive, and dwelt on the defects of M. |
Bertillon - arguments, pointing out the I
striking resemblance of the alleged doc-'
tared handwriting with Kstorhazy's writ- j
Ing*, who, he added, in everybody's opln- j
ion, had relations with Colonel Sen warn- :
koppen; the former German, military at- |
tache at Paris; and the dissimilarities be- i
tweon the writing of the bordereau and j
that of the prisoner.
The members of the court-martial were ;
evidently much interested and asked Pro- j
fipssor Molinier a number of questions; to j
which he replied, holding his. conclusion
that Esterhazj was the writer of the bor
dereau. General Mercier requested to i
speak; and called attention to the fact
that In his ..... tore the "Court of !
Cassation Professor Molinier said a !
change was apparent In Esterhazy's writ
ing at"t< r I^*4, and asked that the profes- â¢
%or's former evidence be read.
M. Labor!; leading counsel for the de- â 
fense; inquired if General Mercier Inter* '
Tened with the object of verifying Pro
lessor Mollnler'S evidence. Counsel added
that it. seemed to him that General
Mercier intervened less in the character of
a witness than as a Government commis
sary. He therefore would be grateful to
the general if h<? would explain the bear
ing of his remark.
.Mercier replied that the special point he
desind was to confirm the evidence of
Professor Molinier. which he said corrobo
rated M. Bertlllon's statement that Es- ]
terhazy; the man of straw could change
his handwriting in order to replace Drey- !
Jus. In conclusion General Mercier said:
â¢'Having emphasized the point in regard
to the change In Esterhazy's handwriting
In IKH7, perhaps before', I am satisfied, i
(Commotion.)
Professor Glry. also of the school of An- '
cient Manuscripts, traversed about the
same ground covered by Professor Moll- I
nler.
Counsel asked whether General Mercier
had meant to intimate that Esterhazy's
handwriting had become more or less ifke I
I hat of Dreyfus since i^i. to which the
general replied that he had not wished to
express an opinion, but he reiterated that
M. Bertillon had shown that Esterhazy's I
handwriting had become more like that of I
tin? bordereau. M. 1 . . i retorted that
in' that case, Mercier should not have re
pealed the evidence of Grenler before the
Court of Cassation, as Grenier showed
that Eisternaxy'a calligraphy had become
l"ss md less like tit. writing <>:" the bor
dereau and of Dreyfus.
â M. Illon, at this juncture, said he
desired to speak, but the president of the
court. Colonel Jouast, hastily arose and
.said amidst laughter: "The sitting is !
suspended.'.? Then M. Bertillon resumed I
liis seat In high dudgeon. !
On the resumption of the sitting M. j
Gvorges . â  cot. a member of the Institute, !
w-ns called for the defense, M. I >entange,
of counsel for the prisoner, explaining
that Picot was summoned because, in May
last: he had an Interview with a Foreign
military attache, In the course of which \
mention was made of the document In- \
serted in the' dossier by General Mi rcler.
Colonel Jouaust cautioned the witness to
be careful m his statements. Then after j
promising to use care, Picot started with |

WOMEN BARRED FROM
GOVERNMENT SERVICE
Heads of Departments Invariably Ask for
Men Whenever a Vacancy
(ALL HEADQUARTERS, WKLLINT.TON HOTEL. WASHING
TON, Aug. 30.â Women are bHn;,' practically barred out of the Govern
ment service in departments at Washington. There is no concerted
action among the heads of departments ami the chiefs of bureaus here
to exclude women, but whenever there Is a place to be filled the head
of the office almost invariably asks for a man. This right to discrimin
ate between sexes Is recognized by the civil service regulations, and
when requisition is made for a clerk, stenographer or typewriter, the
commission certifies only thÂ«> names of men.
Civil Service Commissioner Harlow said to-day that the commission
had ;>. long list of excellent women stenographers and typewriters eligi
ble t"i appointments, but they could not get the appointing officers to
them. "There :iv<- many little reasons," said Mr. Harlow. "which
to influence We heads of Government offices to prefer men
to women. The principal one, perhaps, is that while women may do as
well during the regular wprking hours, if there is a rush and it is
necessary to work over hours, work can be crowded on m^n better than
on women. Women are not so willing to work over hours, and the
heads of offices feel more reluctant in asking them to do so than is the
< ase with men."
Chief Examiner Servin of the Civil Service Commission said that
there were many reasons, small in detail but Important in the aggre
gate, which influence heads of Government offices to prefer men
to women. "The heads of offices," said he, "prefer men partly because
in the event of a rush they can work men harder than they would like
to work women. Tn addition to this it is found that women cannot
adapt themselves to as great a variety >>t work as can men. They may
be ill right In a certain line, but when they are put on something else
it Is very hard for them to get the hang of it. They are also inclined
not only to insist < n having all the privileges in the way of vacations

LONDON, Aug. 30.â Baron Alhcrt Grant,
the company promoter, is dead. His title
was conferred, on him by King Humbert I
in 1868 for services In connection with" the I
Victor Emanuel gallery at Milan. Grant
was the "Hooley" of his day. He was

Mr. Schenck Is also said to have received

IN STOCKTON
Discusses the Old Silver
Issue.
WELCOMED BY HUNDREDS
LOOKS FOB NEW PLANKS IN THE
PLATFOBM.
Believes Republicans Will So Handle
Trusts as to Disgust the Inde
pendent Factions of the
Party.
Speaial Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. Aug. 80.â William Jen
nings Bryan passed through the city this
evening en route to the Yosemite on the
southbound train. Several hundred p< r
sons gathered at the depot to hear the
leader of th e silver cause. As soon as
the train stopped It was boarded by Con
gressman De Vries, Mayor Harrison and
other Democrats, wh< started In to
monopolize the time of the orator, while
the crowd which had gathered yelled for
a speech. In response Bryan said there
was l.ss reason to talk in StocktOD than
In any other city in California, as it was
the only one boasting a Democratic Con
greÃsman.
He declared that every plank of the
Chicago platform would he rcaflirmed by
the next Democratic convention, and it"
any changes were made it would be to
make it stronger. The worry the plat
form save the Republicans was one <>f
the surest signs that it was a live issue.
in his opinion additional planks would
be added opposing Imperialism and the
trusts. He believed thai the Republi
can party would handle the trusl Issue
in such a manner as to disgust the inde
pendent faction in the party.
Bryan was still b peaking when the train
pulled out. He was accompanied to Lath
rop by the local commit! Â«.
INSULAR TRADE.
Bryan Says a Cannon Is Unnecessary
to Procure It.
SACRAMENTO, Ante. 30.â William J.
Bryan remained over in Sacramento to
day between trains while en route with
his wife and family to visit the Yosemite
Valley. He granted a brief interview on
the Question of so-called imperialism.
"What is your plan lor dealing with
the Filipinos?" was asked.
"I believe that the treaty should have
recognised the Independence of the Fili
pinos, as it did the Independence of the
Cubans. If the administration had given
to the Filipinos the same assura t
independence that it gave to the t'ubans
the defect in the treats would have b< n
remedied and there would have been no
bloodshed. If the President felt that he
i had no authority to give this assurance
be could have presented the matter to
Congress and have received authority.
i That assurance could be given to the Fili
pinos now. and it should he given. If we
are going to give the Filipinos their Inde
pendence, the sooner we tell them BO the
. better. If we are not going to give them
their independence, then we must be pre
i are,i to defend the. European Idea of gov
ernment, which is essentially different
from the American idea.
"According to the Declaration of Inde
pendt nee. government is a thing treated
by the people themselves and derivi s its
just powers ;rom the consent of the gov
ernod. According to the European idea, n
government is round in Bbape, thirteen
inches in diameter and is ilred out of a
cannon.
"There is an Irreconcilable conflict be
tween a government that derives its au
thority entirely from force and a govern
ment that derives its authority from the
i onsent of the governed. It is thÂ» cliffer
â¢ no between a repfcibUc which recognizes
Lincoln's Idea of a government of â¢ the
people by the people and for the people,
and an empire resting upon force and ex
tending Its limits by conquest."
Mr. Bryan was asked what he thought
of the argument used on the Western
coast, that an imperial policy would in
crease the commerce over the Pacific and
therefore benefit Pacific coast cities.
"I am not Willing to slander your
people," he replied, "by saying that they
would sell the principles of our Govern
ment in order to secure a trade advantage.
Nor do I believe that to the people as a
whole the Imperial policy would give an
adequati return for Its cost.
"The commerce of a nation cm be ex
tended by peaceful means, and a peaceful
i xtension of our commerce would bring
no penalty with it. If. on the other hand,
we attempi to extend our commerce by
casting a net over distant and alien
racer-, and drawing them under our flag
against their will, we must calculate the
consequences of such a course upon our j
national character, as well as upon our
national revenues.
"The people of California labor. .1 dili
gently and with good reason to exclude
Chinese immigrants. What will be the
effect if the floor is opened to 10,000,000
Malays? Certainly the laboring man of j
the coast cannot favor the influx of
Oriental labor. More Filipinos will come
to the United States than there will be
Americans in the Philippine Islands.
The Philippine Islands may offer attrac
tions to American capital, but not to
American labor; and this. Government has
been administered too much in the in
terest of capital and with too little re
gard to the Interests of the laboring man, |
the farmer and the small business man.
"It will be a great deal better for us
to encourage trade with other nations i
by the cultivation of friendly relations
than force trade upon them at the can
non's mouth, and by so doing bring upon
ourselves all the evils that afflict an
empire."

JapaQese Coolies Oppose the

+ VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 30. â As the automobile is causing the pass- â¦

V quietly conducted meetings to oppose the tramway movement. The J
â¦ storm of excitement grew, though, and an open-air demonstration was T

the rickshaw men became so incensed at the tramway- people that they X

â¦ the tramway question was under discussion, and when the members of _â¦

CODE OF LAWS
FOR PORTO RICO
Report of the Insular
Commission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30.â The In
sular Commission, consisting of Gen
eral Kennedy, Judge Curtis and Major
Watkins, which has given six months'
study to the conditions of Porto Rico,
to-day made its report to Secretary
Root. It recommends a form of civil
! government for the islands, to take the
' place of the present military regime-,
i and submits for adoption a code of
laws.
These laws, it recommends, should
be placed in operaion by the executive
decree, arguing that a Congressional
enactment of general laws would
change the status of the island toward
the United States and make it part of
! the constitutional territory of the
i I'nited States. The cud- of laws and
j tho civil government proposed do not
i give to Porto Rlcans tho elective fran
chise tor any "Hires nor extend to them
the privilege of trial by jury except in
I United States courts in cases of fpl
i oniea or civil cases involving; an
ajnount in excess of $500. it recom
i mends that the military force remain
in the island, but be kept in the back
ground ami touch the people only with
a soft hand. English is to be made the
official language of the island, but for
; the present all except the Federal
â  courts are to be Conducted in Spanish.
The code obliterates all Spanish law
and royal decrees and all Bystem* oi
I procedure and substitutes the pro
visions of the code modified after the
i laws of th" States of the United States
and declares? the common law and
principles of equity to be in future the
law of the land where no specific direc
tion is found in the code.
In place of the Spanish system of
courts an American system is provided;
a supreme court, a district court and a
probate with limited civil and criminal
Jurisdiction, and justices of the peace
and police courts in the cities; also a
federal court to have exclusive juris
diction of a;l federal questions and con
current Jurisdiction in civil and crim
inal matters.
There are to be five supreme Judges,
three of whom are to be American and
two natives.
A complete civil, county, township
and city government is to be provided,
and all officials of the civil administra
tion are to be natives, the higher offl
cera to be appointed by the President,
the others by the governor general and
tin- county commissioners,
A public school system with provision
for a superintendent and board of pub
ll<- Instruction and a complete system
of public schools, conducted in English
by American teachers, is provided and
aiso night schools for illiterate adults.
The right to teach Spanish where de
j manded is given.
Full general corporation and railroad
laws with the right of eminent domain
are provided, thus opening the island
to competition and ending the s\stem
of franchises to favored corporations.
All taxes which bear heavily on the
I r and all double taxes on non-resi
dents are abrogated. A marriage law is
provided like those in the States, with
a plan for legalizing consent marriage
i and legitimatizing children, one-half of
whom on the island were born out of
wedlock.
The commission recommends that the
proposed code be put into effect at once
by the President without waiting for
Congress to legislate on the question,
saying that the people or the island are
In distress and an- still b^tng oppressed
by the old Spanish laws and customs:
leaving for Congress the question of
such after-legislation as may be deemed
best.
The commission states that the Porto
Ricans have lost their markets in Spain
I for their coffee by reason of increased
duties and the industry is now lan
guishing for want of an immediate
market for their productions; that
many of the people are dependent upon
! this "industry for employment and sub-.
i slstence and that there must be distress
until the coffee raisers and coffee
handlers can build up a trade with the
United States, and it recommends that
the Government of tho United States
purchase the coffee for our army and
navy in Porto Rico.
As to franchises the laws submitted
i do away with all necessity for the sale
of franchises or special grants therefor
by permitting any persons to incorpor
ate under the general incorporation law
1 and extending the ripht of eminent do
| main to all quasi-public corporations.
There ought, in the opinion of the
! commission, to be a general revision of
the tariff rates on articles imported by
i the island from the United States and
| reductions made on articles of prime
i necessity and total release on some ar
; tides. This new revision, it is argued,
should be made at once and put in
; force. Following this it is suggested
that Congress grant authority to the
â  President to arrange n schedule of re
ciprocal tariff duties in Porto Rico. The
' commission lays stress on the need of
l civil reform in the island and says:
All tho complications growing nut of the
' currency in P.irto Rico cannot bo rrm
! edied until Congress Fhnll place a suffi
cient fund in thÂ« hands of tbo President,
in the shape of Bilver certificates nr troas
: ury notes, all legal tender for their face
value, to enable him to tako up all the
: Porto Rlcan silver find authorize him to
i have It re-coined Into American silver
dollnrs or certificates to replace those
used in tho purchase or taking up of ihe.
i Porto Ricafl Silver, tho differences be
j twppn the bullion value and the sixty
cents paid for them being charged to the
Island and. wwi n practicable, to be con
verted int" Unitod States Treasury re
' servos. This needs authorization of Con
prrss and such authority to be asked for
and Its necessity pointed out.

DOWAGER FEARS
FOREIGN POWERS
Translation of Her Ap
peal to Japan.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Aug. 30.â Mail
advices brought by the steamer Em
i press of China contain a rough trans
â  lation of the letter recently sent by the
Empress Dowager of China to the
Emperor of Japan on the proposed alli
ance between the two countries.
The letter thanked his good cousin
for his good wishes. The writer was in
great difficulties, European powers
were pressing for a portion of the erti-
I pire. England, France, Germany and
j last of all Italy had presented demands,
and the Empress did not know what to
do to satisfy these greedy dogs. Eng
i land was the worst of all, for she had
not disguised her longings for the
Yang-tse Valley and had even set on
Italy to claim Fuhkien. But she had
done more, .she had attempted to frus
trate the Empress' relations with Rus
i Eia. Such indignities were insuffer
able, and she had therefore addressed
herself to her good friend the Emperor
ol Japan i^v Buccor in her distress.
The greatest danger in the future was
the advance of England- England has
i lately, contrary to her orders, annexed
i a portion of Kwang-Tung, and is now
: proceeding to lay her plans in Kiang
' "Wan. The Empress had given orders
i to her viceroys to resist the encroach
ment of this most dangerous enemy.
but they had stated that for want of
ships they were unable to act and that
! even with the return of the Peyang
j fleet England would bo in a position of
! superiority. She therefore appealed
j confidently to her very good friend and
neighbor to assist her.
Promises of subsidies, of appointing
Japanese to command the fleet and
armies, of freedom of trade to Japanese
j shins and merchants accompanied this
epistle, nrj.l finally Japan was invited
to âºâ¢nter into an alliance, offensive and
defensive, to gpt rid of these danger
ous enemies.

that a woman's dainty taste can imagine
is provided for the new-comer's wardrobe.
Nothing i - overlooked save one thing, and
that one thing is the most important. Too
many mothers forget that baby's strength
and health, its ability to withstand the
usual ailments of childhood, ana its vigor
and welfare, as a man or woman, are de-
pendent upon her own health and physical
condition during the period of prospective
maternity. If. during that critical time,
â hi is weak, sickly, nervous and despond-
ent, because of troubles peculiar to her
sex, these conditions are bound to have
their influence upon her baby's health.
Neglect of these conditions invariably
means that baby will be weak, puny and
peevish. Dl Pierces Favorite Prescription
is an unfailing cure for all troubles of this
nature, and it will reinforce a woman's
bodily and nerve strength co that she can
safely undergo the trials of maternity. It
gives health, strength, vigor, elasticity and
endurance to the organs specially con-
cerned in motherhood. , It gives bodily
and nervous hardihood to the child.
"After jsin? fifteen bottles of your 'Favorite
Prescription ' and a few vials of your ' Pleasant
Pellets,' I am entirely cured of uterine trouble.

Mrs. F.W.I-ogel, of 273 Highland Aye., Newark.

GENERAL MACEO'S
SON ARRESTED
Charged With Threats
Against Life.
.Â«IÂ«>oiaI Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE, Aug. 30. â Lieutenant
Santiago Maceo, son of the late Gen
eral Antonio Maceo of Cuban renown,
was arrested by William G. Cody, a
nephew of Buffalo Bill.
The arrest was made last evening at
the Grand Hotel on a warrant sworn
to by W. E. Davidson, and issued on
his representation that Lieutenant
Maceo had threatened to shoot him be
cause Davidson had requested the
Cuban to move from a table to a box
in the Grand Hotel cafe. At the police
station Maceo wept, when, a few
minutes aft<-r his arrest, the little son
of Maceo and the big nephew of Buf
falo Bill went together in search of a
$I."> cash bond. The white-uniformed
prisoner kept a linen handkerchief
pressed to his eyes. A bondsman was
finally found in the person of William
11. B. Hayward of the San Francisco
firm of L. and M. Alexander & Co. He
came to the station and put up the $15
and Maceo was released.
To-day Maceo was convicted In th> i
Police Court. The fine was remitted
and the spectators quickly made up a
purse to pay the costs and secured
bis release.
Maceo was a guest at the hotel and
walked into the dining room with Mr.
Hayward, to whom he had applied .or
the price of a meal. They sat at a table
in the public room when Waiter David
son asked Maceo to move into a box
and the trouble started.
Cody is a member of the police force.
Maceo has been here several days on
his uppers. He is drifting slowly home- i
ward from Victoria, B. C. where
Katherine Tingley, the theosophist.
who brought him to America, left him
stranded. Since his arrival here he has
been a frequent speaker at meetings of
the Volunteers of America. A purse
will probably be made up to take him
further east.

VACANCIES TO OCCUR
War Department Sanguine That
the Philippine Insurrection Is
Nearing an End.
Special Pispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters. Wellington Hotel,
Washington, Aug. 30.
When President McKinley returns to
Washington he will discuss with Sec
retary Root the appointment of officers
to vacancies existing in the grades of
major general :md brigadier general.
The increase of the army, regular and
volunteer, to 96,000 men will increase
the list of major generals to eight and
that of brigadier general to twenty
four. Thf-re are in the service to-day
seven major generals and twenty-one
brigadier generals. The retirement of
General Shafter on October 16 will cre
ate another vacancy in the grade of
major general of volunteers and a va
cancy in the grade of brigadier general
of the regular army. The President
will therefore have authority, after Oc
tober 16, to appoint two major generals
and as it is generally understood that
Generals James F. Smith and Frederick
Funst.'n are Bhortly to return to the
United States from the Philippines and
be mustered out thÂ° President will have
five brigadier generals to dispose of.
Undoubtedly it is the intention of the
administration to leave Borne brigadier
general appointments vacant in order
that some unusual display of gallantry
in the operations in thp Philippines
may be promptly rewarded. One va
cancy now existing in the grade of
major general will bo promptly filled
and the name of Brigadier General
James H. Wilson, now on duty in Cuba,
is mentioned in its connection. Un
doubtedly the vacancy will be filled by
the promotion of a brigadier general.
Administration officials seem un
i usually confident that it will not be
| long before the insurrection in tht
' archipelago is brought to an end. When
j pressed to state the information upon
which they base th?Â»ir confident state
, ments they decline to answer. It is
: known, however, there have been nr
! recent advices from General Otis and
! so far as known nothing has come from
! the commissioners now at Manila. II
â  is undoubtedly expected that the mnrai
j effect of the assignment of so many
troops to the eighth corps will be bene
ficial.
Before his departure from Washing-
I ton to-day Secretary Root discussed
with General Ludington, quartermastei
general, the question of transportation
of the ten regiments organized and ter
being recruited. Two of these regi
ments are now ready for transportatioi
i and will probably be sent from New
' York and the remainder will sail frorr
: San Francisco. Three of the lattei
| volunteer regiments will be sent from
I New York. General Ludington in
; formed Secretary Root that there will
j be no difficulty in securing plenty oi
i transports for the regiments being or
: ganized. but more difficulty will be ex
perienced in getting the regiment?
ready to sail off for Manila. Orders
have been given by General Ludington
directing that th^ steamer Psyche,
' which has b^en used for transportation
: of animals, be transformed into a pas
i senger ship as rapidly as possible.

Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 30.â The
steamer Empress of China arrived this
morning from Hongkong and Yoko

losses Â«>f insurance companies are esti
mated at some $400,000, while the actual
loss is several millions.
Gk)be trotters will regret to hear
that the famous theater street is de
stroyed from end to end. As a system
of lire insurance Jias not yet gained
much hold in Japan on account of the
inflammable nature of the houses the
disaster falls heavily upon the home

peror and Empress presented $6500
toward the relief fund at Toyama and
$3500 for the same purpose at Yoko
hama.
Commander Kataoka has been or

MRS. COOK TOO ILL
TO APPEAR IN COURT
Forced Continuance of the Preliminary
Examination of the Santa Ana
Murderess.
SANTA ANA, Aug. 30.â T0-day at
10 o'clock was the time set for the
preliminary examination in this
city of Katie Cook, charged with
the murder of her husband,
Thomas J. Cook of Peatlands. Early
in the morning the crowd began to
assemble in the Justice's courtroom,
but long before the hour for the ex
amination arrived word came from the
County Jail that the prisoner was unfit
to face the ordeal and the case would
have to be postponed.
Strict in the performance of his duty
the District Attorney grasped at an of
fer made later to go on with the ex
amination at the jail and the office of
1 that institution was extemporized into
j a courtroom. The hour came but not
the prisoner. Instead a statement from
the doctors was presented by the at
WORK FOR WOMEN
SCARCE IN DAWSON
Mrs. N. B. Gillis Tells of Her
Experience in the
Klondike.
SEATTLE, Aug. 30.â About forty
passengers from Dawson arrived to
day on the Al-Ki. Prominent among
these was Mrs. N. B. Gillis of San
Francisco, who leaves to-morrow for
home, in company with her husband.
Mrs. Gillis went into the Koyukuk
country over a year ago, and finding it
destitute of gold .made her way to
Dawson. She endured many hard
ships, particularly in the Koyukuk
section, and regards neither Alaska
nor the British Yukon a suitable coun
try for a woman unless attended by
her husband. Mrs. Gillis tells of hav
ing met L. Myers on the Yukon, en
route to Dawson with a hack and a
| hearse, which will be the first of either
I seen in the Klondike metropolis.
' Myers observed that he would have no
trouble in getting Dawsonites to ride
in his cab, but feared that they would
not take kindly to the hearse.
During her residence in the north
Mrs. Gillis obtained much information
regarding the opportunity for women
to gain employment and make money j
in Dawson. She states that in the new
metropolis women are handicapped on
every side, their services not being in
much demand, while the wages paid
are considerably below prices paid for
the same class of work when performed |
by men.
Washing, ironing and cooking are :
about the only fields open for women.
and even these positions are scarce and
hard to capture. Restaurants and
hotels that furnish meals at all hours
pay women cooks $125 per month and
i board, waiters $100. Good ironers of
starched clothes are paid from $5 to $7
per day of ten hours, boarding and
torney for the defense that the prisoner
was suffering from nervous collapse
and to bring her into the courtroom
would endanger her life. A continu
ance until Saturday was granted and
the witnesses were instructed to appear
without further notice on that date.
To-night the unfortunate woman is
resting under the influence of opiates
and all visitors are strictly excluded
from her cell in the female ward of the
prison. Popular feeling is strongly in
her favor and although not probable it
would surprise no one were she to be
set free at the conclusion of the pre
liminary examination.
The chief witnesses in the case are
Miss Mabel Moody. G. W. Moore and
W. M. Kesman. Miss Moody was em
ployed as a servant in the house. Mrs.
Cook accused her husband of intimacy

Wild Nutling, a brown stallion, by Wild
Nut, with the aid of "Billy" Jonathan
and two feel of chain, disposed of his field
in the 2:30 class pacing event at Oakland
track yesterday, after losing one heat to
stylish Vlleria. Wild Nutling, be it
known, is a loafer, with an utter disre
gard for whips or spurs. The- piece of
chain used by Reinsman Donathan as a

Viscaya. which fell a victim to the guns
of Sampson's fleet. The winner was the

smoothly gal ted winner of the 2:26 trot,
In three straight heats, the best time
made being 2:22 flat, over a track fuliy
three seconds Blow. In the latter event,
.Man' Newman stepped two splendid
heats, securing second money, hut was
evidently outclassed a bit by the winner.
Alix B, the favorite, showed signs of
lameness, and was not bothersome.

A break on the back stretch did not help
Nutling, and Bigelow kept the Woodland
mare in front to the end, winning by a
couple of lengths in 2:19.
In the heat following, Vileria had
enough and it proved easy traveling for
Wild Nutling, which downed Sable La

Why They Were Dropped
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 30.â The dropping
of the Watsonvillf baseball team from the
league caused much surprise here. A
committee is going to San Francisco to
Interview the baseball magnates in an
effort to have them rescind their action.
The Inside history of the cause for drop
ping San Jose and Watson vi He Is that
| Manager Harris of San Francisco had be
come tired of payinff $2."0 a month toward
supporting the Sab J<>sÂ»- team. Wataon
vilre demanded $100 a month from him,
threatening to withdraw if not paid.
Harris paid the money for one month,
but then deoliupd to pay any more. It
was originally intended to drop only San
Jose, but when the magnates heard the
condition of affairs they decided to drop
Watsonville also. Whalen and Morrow of
Watsonvllle have been signed by San;.!.
Cruz. Daubebia will be retain^i ;,.<
, pitcher. Either Balsz, Haines or Andrews
I will also be signed as pitcher. Kleiber,
1 who plays shortstop, will be released from
I the local team.

It was nearly half-past 7 when the
J ton's crew and a delegation of blue-
jankers from the Newark landed at tne
rnment wharf and formed in
inarching order on East street. Head
ed by a platoon of mounted police the
parade moved toward th>- ferry depot. j
the men of th.- navy keeping perfect
â  | to the â Hip: hip! hip!" of the of
flcere and the music of the bugle calls.
At Market Btreet they were met by a
band, but the soldiers of the Califor
nia regiment, who were to have been
there to act as Â»n escort, had forgotten
thHr appointment, and th^ procession
went without them. All along the
line of march the boya of the Boston
were cheered, and th>' booming of can
non and the sizzling of rockets added
noise to the greeting.
Those men who fought with Dewey
are a sturdy looking crowd. They trod
the cobbles and the bitumen like vet
erans. The people that lined the streets
to get a glimpse of them felt amply re
warded.
All along the line the absence of the
Californians was commented upon. The
thrones expected to get one more look
at their own fighters, and their disap
pointment was not concealed.
As thÂ»- parade passed by the multi
tudes did not rush in and follow In the
wake. They were so surprised at th"
brevity of the turnout that they did
not fully realize that it was all over
until the rear was fully a block away.
Henry McPiJse, the secretary of the
citizens' executive committee, which
arranged the entertainment for the
visitors, also lost the procession and
dit>vc wildly UP and down the street
on top of a hack trying to locate it.
The men marched out Market street
to Powell, where they countermarched
to Third and went down Third to the
Grand Opera-house. Most of the build
ings in the city that had been illumin
ated with electricity upon the return of
the California troops blazed a welcome
last night to the sailors. There was a
big display of fireworks opposite the
Spreckelfl building and from the
tops of the buildings along the line of
march thousands of Roman candles
belched balls of fire.
In anticipation of a crowd as large as
that of last Saturday night nearly the
entire police f< rce was stationed along
Mfirk'-* Btreet They were armed with

their riot dubs and ready for business,
but the people found room enough on
the sidewalks and the bluecoats had
very little trouble. At the junction of
Market, Third and Kearny there was a
Jam, but it was easily handled and did
not resist the orders to "Move back."
The Jolly jackies of thy Boston and
Newark went to the Grand Opera -
house to see "Paul Jones" as guests of , â¢
the executive committee and five hun- j
dred of the First California buys went j (
with them. It was a Jolly navy crowd <
at a Jolly navy play and although the j i
staid officers of the cruisers were seated j Â»
in a box with the members of the com- '
mittee that made not one whit dif
ference to jackie. ,
All of the members of the executive ]
committee were there; Mr. Martin, Mr. ' j
de Young and Mr. Lawrence. Mayor <
Phelan was there, too, and he had some ', :
nice words to say of the gallant fight
ing men of the Boston and Newark.
In a little speech before the curtain ;
was rung up he said it was an honor
to San Francisco to be visited by these j ;
men who had fought for and won i '
laurels in both oceans and he assured ;
them that San Francisco appreciated
' it all.
The Boston boys were seated in a j
conspicuous place down stain where;,
the civilian end of the audience might i '
see them and cheer them, and the boys
fr.jm the Newark, under command of
Naval Cadets Foreman and Courtney, ;
occupied the first balcony and were as j
heartily received and cheered as were
: the men of the Boston.
The guests of the executive committee
! were Lieutenant Commander Allen,
rhKf Engineer Hall. Lieuienant Gib- ;
: pun, Assistant Surgeon Chaffee and
Ensign Edward McCauley Jr.
It was a gala night at the Columbia '
Theater. The fiir inside the playhouse
seemed surcharged with patriotism,
nnd every little while it would find a
i vent in the hearty cheering by the f-ol- : :
> diers and civilians who crowded its
precincts. Nearly 500 officers and men ,
j of the California" and other regiments
; occupied seats in the house and <-n
| joyed Clay Clement's presentation of
"The New Dominion." Patriotic music
i and beautiful decorations were
â  features of the evening's entertain- â 
ment. A beautiful souvenir programme* ! (
1 was presented to those who attended
j the performance. The cover was drawn
! by Frank Keane, and represented Llb
j erty holding back the folds of a curtain
i disclosing a soldier and a sailor side by
side, and over them were the words,
"Army and Navy Night."
The second act of the play gave the
audience a chance to grow enthusias
tic. The scene presented was the hall
â¢ in a mansion In Virginia on the Fourth
|of July. Flags were profusely used in
1 decorating it. and when the pretty he
roine came to the front with the stars
I and stripes the cheering grew loud and
long.
Seated In the balcony of the theater
: was Mrs. A. S. Townsend, the "fairy
godnjother" of the volunteers. Her
; presence In the house was undlscov
', ered. The applause throughout the
play was generous and attested the
I appreciation of the soldiers and (
' civilians for the efforts of the actors.
There was a largp representation of : i
the First California Regiment at the
Orpheum. Their presence at the ponu- (
lar playhouse wns the occasion of all
kinds of enthusiasm. A tremendous (
' crowd filled th<> house and every oppor
i tunity was grasped to display patriotic '
! fervor.
Seated in the boxes were Colonel Dv- '
boce and other officers of the organiza
tion. Mayor Phelan, A. J. Lawrence
and M. H. de Young, members of the
executive committee. The beautiful
decorations and vari-colored lights
heightened the effect of blue and khaki â 
j uniforms and the handsome dresses of
! the ladies in the audience.
Manager Morrissey had a special pro- j
! gramme printed in honor of the Cali- j
i fornla boys and the Orpheum orchestra '<
played patriotic music throughout the ;
I evening. The "Battle of Manila." ar- !
' ranged by Harry Orndorf. the :
' stage director, was one of the I
hits of the performance. Minded
with the firing Â°f guns and musketry
I were the bugle calls and melodies so
: familiar to every American. When
i "Dixie" was played a wave of enthu
i plasm passed over the audience and I
when the beautiful strains of the na- .

ROYAL WELCOME
FOR THE GRANT
It was an exciting day for the troops
on the transport Grant and for the friends
who were eager to welcome them. It be
gan with a trip to the quarantine station.
whereupon every one told every one elsc
that the vessel was poin^ to he fumi
gated. The hip white vessel lay off Angel
Island until nearly 10 o'clock, and in the
meantime all the welcoming parties gath
ered round her and hung on her side
while word wont out that the quarantine
officers were still at work and that she
might be able to dock anyway. Th.- tugs
Uned up four deep at her gangway, the
Fearless, the Golden Gate, the Markham
and the McDowell, and from each frantic
relatives waved flags and handkerchiefs
and shouted to the men mi board.
The vessel was passed without trouble,
and then she steamed down to the stream
off the Fu 1 so m -street .lock, where she
will lie until this morning. It wa.s Â«x
--pected at first that she would dork yes
terday, but the men were disappointed
and their hopes of freedom wt-r.- put off
for another twelve hours. The tugs were
allowed to put their passengers aboard
however, so it was not so bad for the
men after all.
The programme is to have the trans
port docked early this morning, then at
9 o'clock to debark the troops, and form
ing for parade to march them through
the streets to the Presidio under the es
cort of United States troops and the First
California Volunteers. Tiny will arrive
in camp in good time to allow them to
make themselves comfortable before
night.
Governor Steunenberg and his party
consisting of his staff. Congressman Wil
son and a large number of ladies and
gentlemen, besides the delegation from
North Dakota, went out on the McDow
ell. Leading the delegation from North
Dakota were Senators Hansbrough and
McCumbfer and Congressman Spaulding;
there were also Mrs. Truman, wife of
Lieutenant Colonel Truman, commanding
the North Dakota Regiment, and Mrs.
White, wife of Major White of the North
Dakota?, besides the wives of several of
the junior officers. The McDowell stopped
at Fort Mason on her way out to allow
Genera] Shafter to join the party. The
Wyoming people went out on the" Mark
ham and the local delegation from the
welcoming committee went out on the
lrwln. Senator Shoup of Idaho went out
'on the Golden Gate.
The discharged men were allowed to go
ashore yesterday afternoon, as were also
the passengers, as Boon as they had
passed the customs officers. The passen
gers were: Lieutenant Arnold, First
Washington, home on sick leave; Major
Bourns, formerly Health Officer of the
port of Manila, who is on his way home
to be mustered out; Captain Adams.
First Washington, on sick leave, and
Mrs. Adams; Miss Helen Penny, regi

SERGEANT P. W. CORBUSIER
HAS PLUCK AND AMBITION
WOUNDED throe times and
advanced in rank after each
injury is the novel and inter
esting record borne by First
Sergeant P. W. Corbusier of
Troop C, Fourth United
. States Cavalry. He is now
with his command in the Philippines
and is winning fame for himself by
reason of his grit and dauntless cour
age. Although the term of his enlist
ment is nearly up he has vowed not to
return home until epaulets surmount
his shoulders.
Sergeant Corbusier was once a stu
dent at Stanford and then at the Uni
versity of California. He entered tho
latter Institution for the express pur
pose of obtaining military training. In
May. 1898, he enlisted in the troop in
which he has risen to the highest posi
tion to be attained by a non-commis
sioned officer. The plucky Oallfornlan's
ambition is to rise even higher, and
he is studying with that end In view.
He is a son of Major William H.
Oorbusier. medical purveyor of Manila.
The latter was appointed from Califor
nia shortly after the civil war and has
been in the service ever since. Dr.
Corbusier enjoys the distinction of be
ing probably the only officer in the
army who has had three sons bearing
arms nt one timf. It was he who origi
nated the idea that each soldier should
have an Identification tag, and tho
plan was adopted by the Red Cross
Society.
Another son to see service In Manila
was F. C. Corbusier. When the Cali
fornia regiment was being organized
hiv In comnanv wit"h thirty-four
other Stanford students enlisted. They comprised Company X and particl- T
paled in all the engagements the regiment was in. F. C. was appointed cor- V
porai by reason of his knowledge of tactics, and shortly after the arrival of X
the regiment in Manila was advanced to quartermaster sergeant of his com-
pany. He was taken sick on October 6th with typhoid pneumonia, due to Q
exposure, and wasted away to a mere shadow. He was sent home on the jr
transport Grant, and after lying in the hospital here for some time was dis- O
charged for disability. q
H. D. CorbUSier is in the Marine Hospital Service, and is now stationed ~ j
a i Cleveland, O. He Is a graduate of the University of Michigan, and earned Q
quite a name for himself on the gridiron. .*.
There is still another son. who regretted he was too young to enlist. He Q
has an ambition to go to West Point and is studying hard in the hope that
he may be able to go to the military academy. ~
Friends of Sergeant Corhusier are trying to prevail on him to come home *Â»
on furlough and take a needed rest, but he refuses to do so until he can
come home with a commission. He intends re-enlisting, and Is anxious for Â«
more engagements, as after each battle he has been advanced. His next X
promotion will in all probability be to a second lleutenantcy. Friends have Â£
informed him that they would use their influence to get him the coveted honor, q
but he is too proud to allow them to do so. +
* Fourteenth Infantry, First Lieutenant
1 Talbot. First Nebraska, who left the
' hospital to board the transport; E. Ells
i worth Carey of the Freedom Publishing
Company of Manila and A. E. Fout. for
merly chief clerk in the office of the ad
; jutant general in Manila, who is to be dis
charged.
There were seven naval prisoners, who
were taken on board the Blare Island tug
under charge of a squad of marines.
There w< re nine of them when the trans-
I port left Manila, but at Nagasaki two of
them, both marines, managed to elude
their guards, and they escaped There
was another prisoner, Meade of the Idaho
regiment, who was under arrest at the
same time, and he, too, escaped. The
men mixed with the troops on the trans
port's crowded decks, and watching their
chance they got ashore in one of the
boats hanging around the vessel.
The McDowell took charge of the sick
men soon after the transport came to her
: anchorage. There were nearly eighty on
the sick list, and twenty-five of These
were so bad they had to be carried off
the steamer on litters. They were taken
i out to the Presidio wharf at once and
I then ambulances brought them to the
general hospital. They are all reported
as being convalescents.

The discharged men have the usual
complaint to niakf-â that they have not
been given anything like first-class pas
sage home. It is claimed by the men that
the presumption is that they be given
either first-class passage or travel pay,
which is sufficient to secure flr'n-class
passage. The travel pay allowed Is suffi
cient for this, but when tin: men are sent
home on a transport they are kept on
the Government ration and are given
quarters between flecks with the troops
in service, and sometimes <iuarters not
as good as that for the other troops. In
addition, being a collection of men from
various commands, they cannot organize
a mess and so save extra rations, and so
they are compelled to live upon the bare
army ration with no chance to purchase
extras except from their own pockets.
The same objection has heen made by all
the discharged men who have arrived on
the transports.
There was some trouble between the
customs officials and the captain of the
Grant over the question of allowing the
customs men to hoard the vessel Tues
day niirht before the quarantine officers
had taken chargv. One of the inspectors
went out to the Grant just after she
dropped anchor, but Captain Baker re
fused to allow a ladder to be put over the
side for him, and after some parley he
was compelled to go back to the city. He
went out again yesterday morning, but
In the meantime the doctors had boarded
the transport and the customs man was
allowed to come over the side. There
is talk on both sides of having the mat
ter settled, one way or the oth<=T, for it
Is not the first time such a conflict of
authority has occurred. Captain Baker
declared he had the power to prevent
any one from boarding his vessel before
the quarantine officers had made their
inspection, and he made good his position
by not putting over a ladder. The fact
that there had been a smallpox scare on
board may have led to the captain's de
termination to await the coming of the
doctors.
SOLDIERS WILL NOW BE
RUSHED TO THE FRONT
The Government wharf cannot hegin to
accommodate all the transports in port,
anrl In consequence the steamers are
docked all over the front. The Relief

day and went to Howard 3. The Sher

Much repairing has to be done on the

will be the end of September before she
pots away with a regiment of soldiers for

ber 12 and the Sikh about September IS,
all with troops. The Aztec Is now being
got ready to carry horses and will get
away about the middle of the month.
The 'hospital ship Relief is to sail on Sep
tember in and will take surgeons and hos
pital nurses only.
There are now on the way to Manila
the ship Tacoma, with horses, which
palled from here July 27, the steamer
Morgan City sailed August 10. Senator
sailed August 15, City of Sydney sailed
August 18, Siam sailed (with horses) Au

and St. Paul, which sailed fr Â«m Seattle
on August 19 with members of the Fourth
Cavalry and hordes.
On the way from Manila are the Sheri
dan, now out twenty-one days, and the
Zealandia and Valencia. In Manila Bay
are the Pennsylvania, Wyefield, City of
Para, Conemaugh, Tartar, Ohio, New

been to Cebu. lloilo and other places in
the Philippines, and only got back to
Manila on the 26th inst., and the Tartar is
to sail on September 5, via Hongkong,
with the Twentieth Kansas Volunteers.
Uncle Sam has therefore about thirty
transports hard at work, and every one of
them will be required to get the new
regiments of soldiers to the Philippines in
time for the next campaign.
The steamer Brunswick lost one of her
crew on the way down the coast. She

sailor and a boat was lowered, but he
sank before help could reach him. Th>
steamer went backward and forward over
ill.- place for an hour, hut not the slight
est tr.ice of the unfortunate fellow could
be found. He could not swim and his
gum limits and heavy clothes took him
down. The Brunswick arrived in port
yesterday morning with her flag at half
mast.
The British ship Ancaios sailed for Cape
town yesterday with 63,100 centals of
wheat valued at $72,500. Captain i-uiton
took away at least one unwilHng sailor
in his crew. Monday night he was one
hand short and the runners soon supplied
him. They found a "hobo" from the
country who was willing to take "a trip
up the coast," and in less time than it
takes to tell it he was in a Whitehall and
on his way to the Ancaios. His name is
John Henderson and he said he came
from Tulare. As to a ship he knew the
difference between one and a hay wagon,
but that was the extent of his seaman
ship.
When he got aboard the Ancaios and
learned that he was on his way to the
Cape of Good Hope, where the sailors
told him he would have to tight the Boers,
Henderson got scared and wanted to be
put ashore. The first mate soon quieted
him. but Henderson only bided his time.
When no one was looking he got over the
bow and slid down the anchor chain into
the water. He was seen atid before a
friendly boatman could pick him up the
ship"s b<at was alongside and Henderson
was yanked aboard. He yelled out his
name' and the fact that he was being
shanghaied before he was hustled aboard
the Ancaios again and there the incident
closed. Early yesterday morning the
Ancaios sailed and Henderson is now on
his way to Capetown and taking his
first lesson in seamanship.

SENTENCED TO DEATH
Private Thomas McVeigh of
the Wyoming Regiment Is
Brought Home for
Execution.
There is one man aboard the transport
Grant in whose homecoming there is no
joy. He is Thomas McVeigh, of the Wy
omings, and is under sentence of death
for assaulting his superior officer. The
sentence has to be approved by the Pres
ident, so McVeigh was sent from Manila
in irons. The chances are that the tirrl
ings of the court martial will be reviewed
and President McKinley will commute the
sentence to a term of imprisonment.
McVeigh is classed as an incorrigible
by his officers. He was born in New York
thirty years ago and early in his career
enlisted in the regular army. He got into
trouble and was dishonorably discharged.
When the war broke out he was in Chey
enne and joined the Wyoming regiment
when it was mustered into the service.
When the regiment was In camp at the
Presidio McVeigh was in trouble again.
11> got into a row with a comrade named
William Ferris and stabbed him. For this
he was arrested and tried before Judge
Conlan. None of his comrades would tes
tily against him and in consequence he
got off and was sent aboard the transport,
which was ready to sail for Manila.
On November 16. IS9B, McVeigh was in
trouble again. The non-commissioned of
ficer of the guard gave him an order and
he refused to obey. He was ordered again
and he knocked the non-com, down. For
this he got three months' imprisonment In
Billbid prison.
While he was in jail McVeigh conceived
a great, hatred for Captain D. C.
Wrighter. Aftei he was liberated he lay
in wait for the captain and met him as
he was returning to camp from the
trenches. "We met on the roadway,"
said Captain Wrighter last night, "and
McVeigh stopped me with the remark:
'I've had it in for you for a long time.
Now I'm going to take it out of you." I
asked him if he knew what he was doing
and he answered me: 'Yes, I know dâ d
well. I'm going to take the chances.
Either you'll lick me or I'll lick you.'
"I warned him again that the conse
quences would be very serious and with
that he made a pass at me. I warded oft
the blow and pushed him back. He called
me a vile name and made a rush at me.
1 avoided him and he said: Til kill you."
With that 1 drew my revolver and said I
would kill him if he did not desist. I saw
a couple of Captain Holtenhouse's men
standing a few yards away and I called f
them to put McVeigh under arrest. They
did so and he was taken to camp a
prisoner. .
"Soon after his arrest Mc\ eigh was
tried by court martial and he was sen
tenced to be shot to death by musketry
at such time and place as the proper au
thorities may designate.' General Otis or
dered that he be returned to the United
States to await the pleasure of the Presi-
McVtJgh is now aboard the Grant and
will be sent to the military prison as soon
as the transport docks.

AGAIN, COLONEL BRYAN.
/"* OLONEL BRYAN is impending, and we take
( Lsion to extend to him the freedom of the
city and the hospitality of California. We mr
r him and his interesting family a good time
and r< stful enjoyment of the matchless scenery of our
mountains and valleys. We wish he could cast off
political cares, but perhaps he bears them lightly, and
it may be that his mind rests while he attends to them.
He has made several speeches while coming to us.
and from them it is apparent that he is practicing with
anti-imperialism as an issue.
The New York Journal, which early began "nail
ing the Hag to the Philippines,'" is an earnest sup
!olonel Bryan, and recently in discussing
the pleading certainty of his nomination, election and
useful service in the Presidency, said: "The Journal
believes in expansion, but not in imperialism. In the
true sense all Democrats are anti-imperialists â that
is. they are all opposed to arbitrary government and
all in favor of making our Hag the symbol of freedom
wherever it may po. On that basis all can unite next
year. Mr. Bryan will learn the difference between ex
pansion and imperialism before that time. If there
bad been no expansion there would have been no
Nebraska for Mr. Bryan to hail from and no lowa
to furnish him an audience for his speeches. Expan
sion will be a settled fact before the next Democratic
convention meets, but imperialism, the exploitation of
the ruled for the benefit of the rulers, will still be a
live issue and upon it the Democratic party can go
united to victory."
We wish not to be taken as offensive when we ex
press surprise that one of his supporters should ad
mit that Mr. Bryan has anything to learn. Their
support of him heretofore has been based on the be
lief that he knew it all. But the Journal kindly gives
him a year in which to learn that expansion is right,
though accompanied by our forcible conquest of the
Philippines and by violation of our pledge as to Cuba.
So far, the Journal says, all Democrats are agreed.
Therefore all Democrats agree with President Mc-
Kinley. The Journal thinks it right to expand and to
rule the people over whom we expand, but that it will
be imperialism and wrong to exploit the ruled for the
benefit of the rulers. The lesson seems easy, and otir
faith in Colonel Bryan's intellectual capacity is so
strong that we are wiliing to bet a reasonable sum
that he can master the lesson staked out for him by
the Journal and so put himself in line with all Demo
crats. Perhaps he and the Journal will point us to any
example in history in which the rulers have failed for
their own benefit to exploit 'lie ruled. That iÂ» why
some have always wanted to rule. It is the germ, be
ginning and foundation o. the desire of some to sub
ject others to their rule. It is the reason why ex
pansion as defined by the Journal is favored. Every
reference to ccjjnmerce following the flag, to expan
sion for trade's sake, to the alluring opportunities for
capital, is simply a proposition to exploit our newly
acquired subjects. In tin- tropic- there is no profit
in ownership or sovereignty without surh exploita
tion. Therefore expansion and imperialism are as in
separable as Colonel Bryan and the silver issue.
But we beg â¢ â¢ ' ' this reference to politics puts
a fly in the anibei Colonel Bryan's enjoyment of
California. He is :i Democrat and therefore, accord
ing to the Journal, is an expansionist, whether he is
aware of it or not. and we have only ventured to call
â¢'ention to his tag.
The German naval maneuvers have resulted in
something like actual war. The Aegir, steaming
ahead without showing lights, ran into the Aberfoyle,
and each ship demonstrated its fitness for hostile con
flicts by wrecking the other. As a maneuver the
jifTair was a complete success, and it is to be hoped
the Kaiser will have it repeated for the benefit of other
nations.
The fact that St. Louis is reaching out after our
trade ought not to discourage us. This is a frre
country, and we can retaliate by reaching out after
hers.
THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
THE President in his speech at Pittsburg aban
doned his policy of indirection and uttered him
self plainly upon his intentions as to the Philip
pines. His statement is in these words: "Peace
brought us the Philippines by treaty cession from
Spain. The Senate of the United States ratified the
treaty. Every step taken was in obedience to the
requirements of legislation. It became our terri
tory, and is ours as much as the Louisiana purchase,
or Texas, or Alaska. "
The country has not forgotten that the treaty was
grudgingly ratified, and as far as the Republican vote
of the Senate is concerned would have failed because
! of the Philippine cession had not Mr. Bryan come to
! the assistance of President McKinley and induced a
j sufficient number of his supporters in the Senate to
j give it their votes and so secure it* ratification. Imme
i diatcly upon its ratification the Senate passed this
! resolution: "That b., the ratification of the treaty of
i peace with Spain it is not intended to incorporate the
! inhabitants of the Philippines into citizenship of the
i United States, nor is it intended to permanently an
i nex said islands as an integral part of the territory ol
; the United States."
The passage of that resolution was a legislative
act. definitive of the intentions of the Senate in rati
fication of the treaty. It is the sole existing legisla
tion on the subject of the Philippines, and is a declara
tion that the treaty could not have been ratified had
its purpose been to make the Philippines as much an
integral part of our territory as Louisiana. Texas or
Alaska.
So far. then, the President is in palpable error as to
: the cession of the Philippines. In the careful elabor
-1 ations of his speech he turns upon all who accept the
Senate's declaration of what was intended by ratifica
tion. During the pinch and crisis of the Civil War
Lincoln strangely preserved a non-partisan expres
sion. President McKinley enters actively into par
tisan contention and takes sides against the Senate.
His speech mistakenly places Louisiana. Texas and
Alaska on the same moral and political plane as the
Philippines. Perhaps the future may prove that it
would have been better for his cause had he frankly
stated and discussed the difference between the two
cases. We acquired Louisiana by cession from France
and Florida by cession from Spain and Alaska by ce?.
sion from Ru^ia. The French population of Lout- ;
j siana was not in rebellion against France. They had
not expelled French jurisdiction from every place but
New Orleans. They had not for a century been in
chronic revolt and seeking independence and self
government. They had not denied and disputed and
by force of arms resisted French sovereignty. Nor,
had the Spanish population of Florida in like manner
revolted in resistance of Spanish sovereignty; nor had
the Russian and native population of Alaska disputed
the rule of the Czar. When those treaties of cession
were made France. Spain and Russia were in posses
sion of the property ceded. They had the power to
deliver it, and the garrisons of their military posts j
ni arched out and saluted our flag and sovereignty and
we did not fire a shot to make the sale and transfer j
complete. The subjects of France and Spain were
privileged by the terms of the cession to become at
once citizens of the United States.
The treaty ceding Louisiana provided that "The in
habitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated
in the Union of the United States, and admitted as
I soon as possible, according to the principles of the
Federal constitution, to the enjoyment of all the
rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the
United States." The treaty of cession of Florida
made the same provision.
Texas was an independent nation and was admitted
directly into the Union, after it- people had so ex- j
pressed their desire, and the stars and stripes without
opposition replaced the lone star flag.
In these cases there was actual possession of the
territory ceded and the power to deliver it. It is seen
at a glance that there i- no parallel in the Philippine
case. The President says: "Until the treaty was
ratified we had no authority beyond Manila city, bay
and harbor. Spain was still in possession of the re
mainder of the archipelago."
This is at wide variance with the facts. Before we
captured Manila the native revolutionists against
Spain, who defied her authority and disputed her
sovereignty, had dispossessed her of every other foot
of Luzon. Panay, Negros and Cebu. So far from
being in possession her power was effectively extin
guished and thousands of her troops were prisoners
in the hands of the victorious Filipinos, who had
beaten and dispossessed her. She had no title to cede,
no property to sell.
We had dispossessed her of Manila and Cavite. an 1
of not another foot. They were our spoil of war. The
rest was the spoil of the Filipinos, whose valor had
conquered it.
Here, then, is not only a moral but a legal, a poli
tical, difference between the cases which the President
represents as exactly alike. A cession is a -ale which
passes title and is subject to the same principles as
those which govern the sale and purchase of land or
personal property. No rights are conveyed by a sale
or cession unless there is peaceable and not adverse
possession and delivery of what is sold. Lacking the
power to deliver, there is no power to cede or sell.
The Spanish title to everything outside of Manila and
Cavite had been extinguished and sovereignty had
passed from her to the conquering Filipinos.
Therefore we bought from Spain what she did not
own and could not deliver. The laws of nations, the
; laws of war, the principle of title by conquest recog
j nized by both, nullify our title to the islands resting
| on Spain's conveyance, for she had none to convey.
These are facts that cannot be disputed and recog
nized principles that cannot be ignored. We hold
! Manila and Cavite by the valid title of conquest, but
in morals and law we have no title to what Spain
quitclaimed without possessing.
Let us all be frank. The cession by treaty is in
valid. We are engaged in a war of conquest. We
are invaders upon a soil to which we have no title.
! It will be ours by the laws of war when we conquer
it, and not before. The President will do himself
credit and his party a favor by putting his case on its
proper footing and by not descending from the dig
nitie? of his office to rail at his countrymen who claim
i the right of free speech in discussing the policy of
conquest. They have been pleased to agree with him
| when he snid, "Forcible annexation is criminal ag
gression and opposed to our national code of
morals."
If he now have determined that the national honor.
commerce or other attribute or interest of the repub
lic requires the conquest and forcible annexation of
the Philippines, let him trust his countrymen f:ir
enough to admit that his characterization of such
policy was a mistake, or was subject to modification
by our own interests or necessities.
The issue must be tried out on its naked merits, and
the President's speech has presented in their stead
reasons that are unsound and facts that have no exist
ence.
If there be war in South Africa it will be the fault
of the British, for it is a sure thing if they keep out of
Oom Paul's country he will keep out of the

THE WAR REVENUE LAW.
REPORTS from Washington arc to the effect tint
Secretary Gage and other treasury officials are
busily engaged in considering what measures
shall be taken to meet the large increase in expendi
tures for the maintenance of the army. All hopes
that the war revenue taxes might be repealed or
diminished at the coming session of Congress have
been abandoned. The tax law will have to be re
vised, but the revision will be in the direction of aug
menting and not of lessening the burden upon the tax
payers.
The last Congress appropriated for the maintenance
of the army, including all expenses except those for
the construction of fortifications, about $80,000,006,
thus giving the War Department a fund sufficient for
an expenditure of about $6.506,000 a month. During the
two months which have nearly passed of the fiscal year,
however, the army has cost more than ,000,000.
The war revenue, law authorized the issuance of
$100,000,000 of certificates of indebtedness and $400,
--oco.ooo of bonds. It has been held by the law officers
of the Government that the insurrection in the Phil
ippines is virtually a continuation of the war with
Spain, and. consequently, an issue of bonds would be
valid to meet the present emergency. Secretary Gage
is reported to have stated, however, he does not think
a bond issue will be necessary. Congress, therefore,
will be. asked to increase the appropriation and the
war taxes. N
The operation of the war revenue law has disclosed
a considerable number of defects. In the haste of
preparing the act to meet the need of the nation
errors of language were committed which defeated
the intentions of Congress, and in several cases the
decisions of the courts have been such as to diminish
the expected amount of the revenue. Hence the
necessity of a revision of the law under any circum
stances, and it appears likely to be one of the first
things to which Congress will direct its energies.
In reviewing the work of the treasury officials
who are preparing the new estimates and considering
ways and means of increasing the revenues, the Wash
ington correspondent of the Philadelphia . Record ;
says :
"Just where to impose these taxes is the question !
now troubling those in charge. The imposition of a
stamp tax upon all patent protected articles is sug
gested, the theory being that the value of the article
is greatly enhanced by the protection of the patent
laws of the United States, and that, as a war measure,
purely, the Government would be justified in demand
ing a fractional part of the profits secured through
the establishment of a monopoly by virtue of the
patent laws. It is also proposed to place a stamp tax
on all slot machines in which there in any clement of
chance. It has been found that the manufacture of
these machines has attained great proportions. In
each of them the percentage of profit to the pro
prietor is enormous, and the tax would not be oppres
sive. Of course this would not strike those machines
which dispense chewing gum, for in them there is no
element of chance, and the gum already pays a tax
to the Government. Another proposition that has met
with favor at the Treasury Department is one to put
a stamp tax on all firearms except such as are used for
national, State or municipal purposes. This would
in all probability be a heavy tax and would yield a
large revenue. A similar tax. only less burdensome,
is suggested in connection with fireworks."
It will be seen from these estimates that after paying
$20,000,000, or about $2 a head, for our Philippine
fellow citizens we will have to pay about $40 more a
head to herd them up. The expense is not too much
for so rich a nation, but the people will demand that
in the revision of the war revenue act care be taken
to avoid any ambiguities of language that will permit
tax-shirking on the vast scale now practiced by the
telegraph and express companies. A clause which
would compel the shirkers to pay the back taxes would
be both just and popular. The issue is an important
one. If the people arc to be harassed with taxes upon
almost everything they use and upon every commer
cial transaction, it is imperative that fairness and im
partiality be exercised in imposing the burdens.
GOEBEL TACTICS IN KENTUCKY.
OXE of the first good results of the revolt of the
decent Democrats of Kentucky against Goe
hel has been the disclosure of the methods re
sorted to by the Democratic machine under the
Goebel law to carry elections. The revelations show
that under Goebel management political contests in
Kentucky would be as farcical as anything ever de
vised for the plot of a comic opera.
Last year W. E. Thompson, a prominent Democrat
of Frankfort, was appointed one of the Election Com
i rnissioncrs for Franklin County. The chairman of the
: Democratic County Committee, who was a friend of
Thompson, wrote to that gentleman advising him not
to accept the appointment, and giving reasons win
he should not. The letter has now been made public,
and as an exhibit of the tactics of the Goebel Democ
racy it deserves to be read in full. It nm> thus:
"You were indicated by the County Committee as
cue of the Election Commissioners for this county.
No better man could have been appointed, but it is
an unenviable position and one you should not ac
cept. Our county is all right, safely Democratic, but
city elections cannot be won by a fair count, and you
I know that as well as I do. Incompetent, unreliable
Republican judges will have to be appointed. The
right of the Republicans to indicate who shall repre
sent them as judges, etc., will have to be ignored and
the Election Commissioners will have to do this or re
ceive the ill will of the city Democrats. I would not
do it, for I could not conscientiously do so, and I
know you would not. Therefore, my advice to you
is to refuse to act. I had a talk with Judge Pryor on
the subject, and he said if you would refuse to act he
! would appoint any one that we might name, which
would be "Ben' Marshall. You know 'Ben' is so par
tisan that he thinks that anything is all right so that
â  it helps the Democrats."
Thompson acted upon the advice given in the letter
and declined to serve on the commission. A good
partisan Democrat was put in his place. Little or no
complaint was made of the elections that year, for the
issues and the offices at stake were small and com
paratively little popular interest was taken in the con
test. This year, however, a Governor is to be chosen
and large issues are involved. By the aid of his ma
chine and his peculiar methods of doing politics Goe
bel won. or stole, or extorted, the Democratic nomina
tion for Governor, and now the Democrats of the
j Thompson class have revolted. They were willing to
! keep silence last year, when Goebe! laid his plans for
counting Republicans out, but now that he has under
| taken to count out Democrats as well their natural
! and virtuous indignation breaks the bonds of silence
and the world is invited to see what villainy is done
ill the name of Democracy.
Kentucky is to be congratulated upon having
! Democrats who will not serve the uses of such a po
litical machine, nor submit to its domination. The
protest they have made can hardly fail to be effective,
and Goebel's men will have to count hard and count
fast if they succeed in counting him into office in
spite of the array of stanch Republicans and honest
Democrats who are opposing him.
PAN-AMERICAN EMBLEM.
The beautiful emblem adopted by the publicity committee of the Pan-American
Exposition, which will be held at Buffalo during the 6iimmer months of the year
1901, was the work of Raphael Beck, a Lockport artist, whose design was by all
conceded to be the most beautiful and comprehensive of the four hundred and
odd drawings which were submitted.
The design tells the hopes and aspirations of the management of the coming
fair as no words can, for the high and noble underlying purpose of the Pan-
American Exposition is to show to the world the progress that has been made
by the peoples of the western world during the fleeting century and also to bring
about closer trade and social relations between all the peoples of all the
Americas.
Nothing could more beautifully express the idea of a binding together of the
people of the North, Central and Southern divisions of the Western Hemisphere
than Mr. Beck's picture, which shows the sweet-faced nymph of North America
smiling a welcome as she looks down and extends a snowy arm across the
isthmus of Yucatan in greeting to her sweet-faced sister of the south, who,
by the way, seems fully as eager to clasp the extended hand and do her share
in the effort to bind together the north and south in the holy bonds of an all-
American sisterhood.
COMMUNICATIONS
AN EXPANSIONIST.
On leaving church last Sunday the fol
lowing letter waa placed in my bunds:
SAX FRANCISCO, Aug. 1!>. 1899.
Mr. Dexter: Is It not about time for reb
els and traitors, or what might be mure prop
erly called "copperhead;;." to stop talking
nÃainst the policy of the Mi Kinky Govern
ment as concerns the Philippines? Let me
tell you, sir, that men like yourself will not
be allowed to utter such sentiments as have
emanated from jour pen In Tlie Call and

Frequently I receive unsigned letters,
which are always consigned to the waste
basket. In this case it is different. In a
sense the epistle is amusing. It shows the
j tone, temper and intense feeling possessed
Iby some imperialistsâ l cannot believe all.
Certain it is. no trur, genuine son of
America would be guilty of uttering such
sentiments, it is very strange that some
men do hot feel like allowing a different
opinion to be expressed from their own.
Is it not also true that the tendency of
Imperialism is to shut everybody's mouth,
suppress every letter, paper, pamphlet,
etc., unless favorable to the imperialistic
i Idea of expansion and power? I believe
iso much must be conceded. Allowing the
I point to be well taken, Is it not a fact that
as a nation we are fast nearing an abso
lute despotism, leaving behind t"he tradi
tions at a once happy republic? Such be
ing the case, may we not with propriety
turn back to history and read the fate of
ancient Rome?
Mr. de Koven is presumed to be a rep
resentative Imperialist. Jf so, let me say
to him and to all men of like thought,
that the spirit of Samuel Adams, George
Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the
liberty-loving hosts of American Inde
pendence Is not dead nor asleep, but quite
alive to the exigencies of the present day.
1 There are men all over this broad land,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, who will
Btand fur right and righteousness at all
times and who cannot be intimidated by
threat or the semblance of imperial pow
er. We are not living in the time of
Moses Caesar or Napoleon, but in the
light of a better and brighter day, when
wars should cease among civilized peo
ples Sermons drawn from the tribal
wanderings of the children of Israel, "for
ty years in the wilderness," can hardly
be 'made harmonious with this era of
American expansion as relates to the
Philippine Islands. It is strange how some
expansion clergymen can see in Old lesta
ment history any relation of times, sea
' sons or conditions from which to take a
text and try to prove therefrom that "it is
God's Will" that America should BUbjU
gate and if possible annex the Philippine
country- When a statement is made 'that
<;,,(! foreordained that America should
possess that country," I must say it
imimN to me like an insult to Almighty
God To drench a land in blood without
one 'really good or reasonable cause can
not be tlie will of our gracious all-loving
i Father. A people desiring freedom, ht>-
I ertv and a government of their own are
told by the Government of the once boast
ed liberty-loving America, you cannot
have that right. Shall we have charity
for th<>Â«e who preach and believe in such
a doctrine? Certainly, charity toward all
nun and especially to those of the house
hold' of faith. Hut. my friPtid*. do not try
to prove your position from texts taken
'â¢ from "the wilderness," but select from
the teachings of Jesus, and see how- far
I you arc able to prove your position from
I what the Master says.
Shall we be kind to our brother who
' differs with us? By all means, but very
plain that the error may be not in the

A WELL-EARNED VACATION.
Fire Marshal Towe Granted a Six-
Weeks' Leave of Absence With.
Salary to Visit the East.
Since Fire Marsha; Towe commenced his
duties "some thirteen years ago he has re
fused to take a vacation] as he was too
much engrossed in the difficult work
which he had to undertake. That his en
ergy faithful discharge of his duties and
ability have been fully recognized and ap
preciated by the Board of Fire Under
writer is evidenced from a letter he re
ceived a few months ago, signed by Wil
liam J Dutton, chairman of tho Fire and
Water' Committee of the board, as fol
lows:
It gives me pleasure to advise you
that at a meeting of the Fire and
Water Committee of the Board of Un
derwriters, held this day. it was unani
mously decided to grant you a six
weeks' furlough, on salary, for the
purpose of visiting the. East, a trip
which the committee understands you
have thus far not found time to take
since you assumed the duties of Fire
Marshal some thirteen years ago.
The committee prefers that you
would make your own selection of the
time of your trip, as you are best able
to judge when you could most conveni
ently be absent from your duties and
when the trip would be of the greatest
benefit to you in the way of securing
Information.
When you advise the committee of
the proposed date it will take pleas
ure In making due recommendations
to the proper board for the providing
of the funds for your expenses, which
the committee is unanimously of the
opinion should be borne by the under
writers.
The Fire Marshal, accompanied by his
wife, will leave on his much-earned vaca
tion for the East by this evening's train,
and expects to re turn with much valu
able information acauired durine his trip.
LATEST STORIES
of the
FUNNY MAN.
Who Has the Button?
There is a good story told of a magi
cian who has passed the great divide.
He was a world-traveled player, and his
wanderings set him upon one occasion
in faraway New Zealand. It was ar
ranged that he should give an exhibi
tion of mind-reading before the King
cf the Maoris.
After some parleying it was decided
that the king himself should conceal
the article which the magician was to !
discover. The mind reader left the room !
and after a time was brought back
blindfolded, as is the custom in such
performances. After some time the ma
gician declared that the hidden article
was in the king's mouth. His Majesty
shook his head savagely In the negative.
The magician insisted upon his point
and demanded that the king's mouth be
opened wide. The king refused. The
magician insisted, and the excitement
became very great, until at last the j
dusky king reluctantly opened his
jaws. The article waa not there!
The next instant, however, the king
wa3 taken with a violent fit of cough- I
Ing. He had tried to swallow the lost |
article, a button, but could not, and was i
compelled to cough it up. The Maoris i
were uproarious with mirth. They did j
not know which to admire the more â j
the wisdom of the magician or the j
heroism of the king.â London Tit-Bits.

ALIENSâ T. J. J., City. T. W. Dwlght,
a well-known law writer, on the subject
of aliens in the United States says:
The principal disability affecting aliens In
the United States concerns the acquisition of
title to real eetate. There are two general
modes of acquisition by purchase and by de
scent. An alien may acquire title by purchase
i lncluding conveyance and devise) In the ab
sence of statutes to the contrary, and can hold
it subject to a proceeding by the State termed
"office found." This If In substance an inquiry
by an officer to examine Into the fact of alien
age, and if that be found, the land Is adjudged
to belong to the State. An alien can convey
no. better title to a citizen than he himself pos
sesses. The defect In the title can be cured by
a private act of the State Legislature. In the
case of descent no title passes to the alien and
no Inquest of office Is necessary. A citizen
brother can inherit from a brother, though
their father be an alien, owing to the common
law rule that inheritance never ascends and it
Is accordingly not necessary to trace through
the alien father. This disability is wholly re
moved in suniÂ» StaU 1 modified in others.
\Vh*>n the ifl*aHlll*yÂ» 1* ant atmo^d le^alatlon
is almost universal -In favor of resident aliens.
If they intend to become citizens, to acquire
land for a limited period and to dispose of It
and transmit it to heirs.
In California the Constitution provides
that "foreigners of the white race or of
African descent, eligible to become citi
zens of the United States under the nat
uralization laws thereof, while bona fide
residents of this State shall have the
same rights in respect to the acquisition,
possession, enjoyment, transmission and
inheritance of all property, other than
real estate, as native born citizens, pro
vided that such aliens owning real estate
at the time of the adoption of this consti
tutional amendment may remain such
owners: and provided further, that the
Legislature may. by statute, provide for
the disposition of real estate acquired by
such aliens by descent or devise. (Amend
ment adopted November 6, 1894)"

"^ that run around
the walls of the office and taking in
everything that is going on about him.
The characteristic which will impress
the stranger's individuality most strongly
upon you will be the gentleness that the
small gentleman seems to exhale, the kind
line.-? and general good will toward men
that beam from his eyes and seems to
be written in every lineament of his fea
ture" It is only the very close observer
that"will notice that the lips that meet
between the gray mustache and white
goatee meet with a firmness that belie
the general impression that is at first
created.
The gentleman is Colonel J. v\ . Jones,
who went to Manila in command of the,
Idaho Regiment and who was invalided
home because his advanced age would
not allow of his remaining in the sickly
tropical climate. He is now here to meet
his old command and bid it a welcome
home.
Though the colonel wore the army blue
for the first time when he went out to
the Orient with his repiment. it was not
his initial experience as a soldier. He had
been there before, but the other time his
uniform was the gray butternut, and ho
wore it from Sumter to Appomattox.
When the South called her chivalry to
the field he was there as a private in the
ranks When Lee's army surrendered
Colonel Jones laid down a sword that
commanded a brigade; and in all the in
termediate ranks there was not a
motion that was given him that was n
bestowed for courage and received â¢
on the field or in the hospital. The scars
of five wounds attest to the justice of Ins
advancement.
The colonel is inclined to view the Span
ish and Filipino wars a little cynicaUy.
"Sho," he says, "there not so fierce as
they air painted."
As the colonel's experience includes
Gettysburg, where he led Pickett's ad
vance, going into the fight with 124'") men
under his command, of which number
only 32S returned, his opinion of what
constitutes a battle should certainly carry
some weight. When the famous Con
federate charge was rolled back the colo
nel did not go with it. He was left on the
field, the nearest living man to the Union
lines, with a bullet through his body. He
lay i here helpless until night came and
his men had a chance to steal forth under
cover of the darkness and bring him in.

TURNER DEFENDED
Widow and Friends of the
Dead Man Uphold His
Name.
"To prove that the murderer of my
husband Is making his crime the blacker
ty falsehood," eaid Mrs. Turner lam
night, "a relation of the various business
dealings between them Is only necessary.
It was about five years ago when my hus
band secured a loan from his murdc-rer
of $Â«>ou. Their dealings went along for
a time, and finally, after Frenna bad so
profited through my husband, together
with those for whom he was a tool, in
gratitude common in his race was mani
fested and he caused my husband's ar
rest 1 Hiring the first trial my husband
went to A. A. Martin and through him
Becured W' 1 from the First National
Bank with which to pay oft the debt ow
ing to Frenna, Going back, It will be
found that during the trial Frenna swore
that the only security he had for the
money owing from my husband was the
Fn-sno deed, which he claimed was
forged. As a matter of fact, be held a
mortgage and dt-eds upon my husband B
property as security aggregating an
amount many times greater than the
amount of money due him, the mortgage
alone being for Â»M,WO. When the indebt
edness wa.- paid on" through Mr.. Martin,
all the deeds which Frenna held were re
conveyed to Mr. Turner and the mortgage
passed to other hands. Shortly alter tins
Ar Turner found that he was unable to
pay the bank the $8000 Becured by Mr.
.Martin and he again borrowed $3'XXJ from
Frenna. .
"At the same time Frenna had agreed
drop the prosecution of my husnan.l,
and I'll the papers he had used in such
prosecution were taken and left in the
office of Attorney Aekerman. subject to
my husband's eaJl. My husband, instead
of going and taking the papers, so far
trusted Frenna that he left the papers In
Mr. Ackennan'a office, and one day Fren
na snowing the value of his word, se
cured an order of court, attain took the
papers and reopened the prosecution of
my husband. All of this can be proved
by the attorneys who represented my
husband at that time. Since then ray
husband has paid Frenna the money he
â  wed him to the last dollar, and that is ;
proved by the fact that It was not long :
ago when Frenna and his wife again re
conveyed deeda to my husband conveyed
to them to secure the mentioned lndebt
edness.
"1 will have all the records when It I
comes to the trial, and if they try to I
prov* that my husband robbed his mur
derer I can prove that It is false. Prenna j
failed in the laundry business just a tew
years ago, and then opened a barber shop
on Polk street. Now, after acknowledg
ing a settlement, he claims that since
then he has loaned my husband $Is.i>hi "n
various promises. Where did he pet this
money? All he evpr had Mr. Turner made
for him, and if he holds my husband's
notes as he claims, he pot them through
blackmail, and this will be a matter of,
proof.
"There was nothing due Prenna, and
ho knows that when he killed my husband
it was deliberate murder. Four years ago
in the offices at 840 Montgomery Btreei lie
bnapped a revolver in mv husband's face
and would have killed him but for the j
intervention of Charles Turner, my hus
band's brother. He jumped into the room j
and then Frenna backed out like a cow
ard." - '.
D. E. Beseker, among' the last to see
Turner alive, says that at one time Fren
na told him that Turner did not owe
him a cent, a complete settlement having
been effected between them. Mr. Beseker
also knew of the word sent Frenna to
send his account to Jake Ram r if he had
one for settlement, and no account came.
Tn regard to the statement that Frenna
holds notes from Turner for $18,000. he
also Bays is false. Turner was either
careless or Frenna wormed them from
him by persecution and threats.
All in all. there are many who have
come forth to give their evidence against
Turner, but there will he many to give
theirs against Frenna for the act, which
even many of his best friends say was
premeditated and that of a coward.

THE SAN IRASTCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 31. 1899.
ENDS HER LIFE BECAUSE
OF UNREQUITED LOVE
PRKTTT. petite Beatrice Garcia is
deadâ dead by her own hand. It
Is the same old story of disap
pointed love, despair and (bath.
The verdict of the Coroner's jury
will probably follow the usual stereo
typed form In such cases and say:
"Death was due to a dosp ol
"lyaol, taken with suicidal intent,"
for the circumstances prove conclu
sively that it was a case of deliberate
self-destruction. But the verdict will
not tell the story of that pathetic trag
edy, any more than it has told the
Btory of countless other tragedies re
sulting from misplaced affections. It
Is told far more completely by the me
dallion of the man whose rejection of
her love had driven her to her death,
which was found tightly pressed to her
aching: heart by the Coroner's dep
uties.
Beatrice came from Teple. Mexico,
with her mother and older sister sev
eral years ago. She was a little more
than seventeen years old when she
first met and loved Antonio Uriarte,
who is employed in George H. Tay &
Co.'s can factory. i*'j!i Battery street.
That was a year ago. and from the
hour they first met her love for An

CAPITALIST HEWITT'S
MIND UNBALANCED
HIS DAUGHTER ASKS TO BE
APPOINTED GUAKDIAN.
He Labors Under the Delusion That
His Presence Is Required in the
East and He Prepares for
the Trip.
Mrs. Elizabeth Davenport yesterday
made application to be appointed Kuardlan
of the person and estate of her father,
Isaac. L. Hewitt, a capitalist, who Is well
known in this city. She alleges that he
Is not competent to attend properly to his
biiÃlness, being 86 years of ag-e and suffer
ing- from the effects of sunstroke received
In the East some time ago. - Mr. Hewitt
resided In Berkeley for some years after
he retired from business, which netted
him a large fortune, but lately has re
sided on Pacific avenue, near Stelner. Ac
cording to the petition filed by Mrs. Dav
enport her unfortunate father labors un
der the delusion that he is wanted in the
East. He constantly prepares for the
journey, waking the family late at night
to pack their trunks, and when restrained
becomes violent. Attorney Oscar Sutro,
who represents the petitioner, says that
the interests of the estate are such that
the appointment : of a guardian . at the
present time Is absolutely necessary, and
hence the application of Mrs. Davenport
at this time. :

tonio continued to grow until It ab
sorbed her whole heart and soul. They
became engaged to be married, and
then the Rirl'n dream of happiness re
ceived its first shock. Her mother re
fused her cons, at to the marriage, and
although Beatrice was ready to defy
her parent, Antonio counseled delay.
The older sister was dead and the lit
tle girl had no one with whom to con
fide her joys and sorrows. Her mother
sent her on a visit to friends in Guay
mas, Mexico, last November, hoping
the change would efface tho image of
I'riarte from th? mind of her child.
It did not, but it did efface the love
for Beatrice from tho heart of An
tonio, so that when Beatrice returned
to San Francisco, a little more than
two months ago, he coolly informed
her that while he hoped they would
remain friends, he no longer desired to
marry her. Still she continued to hope,
believing that her presence would soon
rekindle the flame of love in his breast.
She did not know that he had met and
loved another, and it was not until
she was made aware of that fact that
she began to despair of winning him
back to h< r. Beatrice worked In a
Fuit factory on Mission street, and in
A NEW LINE OF
STEAMERS FOR
EUROPEAN PORTS
"Kosmos" Company
in the Field.
The Kosmos line of steamers that is
to connect Antwerp, Hamburg, London,
and South and Central American ports In
a monthly service will be a great boon to
this coast. California dried fruits and
canned goods will go direct to a European
market, while English and German prod
ucts will come here nearly three months
I quicker than they can by sailing ships.
Between Guatemala and San Francisco
alone the time will be shortened from two
to three days, that is, if the steamers do
not stop at Gulf of California ports.
The Kosmos Company was formerly one
of the largest steamship owners in
Europe, but during the last year it has
suld fuiirt' . n of Its oldest .vessels. Now
none of the fleet is more than ten years
old and all of them are twelve knot ships
or better. They are splendidly fitted out
for first, second and third-class passen
gers and are lighted throughout with
electricity and all modern improvements.
All the steamers are thoroughly equipped
for the handling of freight.
It is not the intention of the company
to do any rate cutting In Central Ameri
can trade. There will be it" fight on
I those lines with the Pacific Mail Com
! pany, but the rates to Colombo and South
1 American ports will be cut in two. This
! will give the merchants of San Francisco
' and the business men of the Interior a
i chance to build up a trade with the west
coasi of South America, enabling them t<>
hold their own With New York and other
Eastern points. At the present time over
2000 tons of merchandise is sent out of
New York to South American ports via
the Straits of Magellan.
The principal intention of the company
is to give a fast steamer service from
San Francisco and San Diego to Havre.
1 London. Antwerp and Hamburg. Special
inducements will be offered to shippers of
canned goods and dried fruits and quick
dispatch will be guaranteed. The coffee
and sugar crops of Central American
ports will be attended to, and once the
Kosmos line is in operation there will be

tho same establishment was employed
the girl who had succeeded her in the
affections or' Uriarte.
A few days ago Beatrice met An
tonio and urged him to keep his prom
ise to marry her. She told him that
her mother's opposition no longer
counted, inasmuch as she had told her
she could get out of the house and do
as she pleased. But Antonio was ob
durate and left her crying on the
street, where she was found a few
minutes later by an old friend of the
family, to whom she confessed that j
Bhe had nothing to live for since her |
lover had discarded her and her moth
er had threatened to drive her into the |
street.
Yesterday morning Beatrice went to (
work as usual, but returned home at
about 10 o'clock. A half hour later g
her mother, who was alone in the
hous". was startled by her screaming: (
"Mamma. I am dying! Mamma. I am
dying!" and rushing into her room, |
found her writhing in agony on the
bed, dressed only in nightgown, {
an empty bottle labeled lysol on the
floor. Aid was quickly summoned, but (
the poison had done its work thor
oughly and half an hour later the (
girl died as the doctors were working
over her at the Harbor Receiving Hos- (
pital. The inquest will be held at the
Morgue at 10 o'clock this morning. I
The girl suicide had gone under the
name of Beatrice Garcia de Paehoeo, <
but it is claimed that Pacheco is only
her mother's maiden name. I^ast even- i
ing a Mrs. Baro and her daughters
called at the Morgue to view the body, i
Josie Baro, one of the daughters, was
the chum nnd companion of Beatrice, i
She says that in all the coniidences
which passed between tho dead girl {
and herself the name of the former's
lover was never mentioned. Beatrice (
complained 'of her mother's precise
rulings and had asked the Baro family t
if she might make her home with them
a few days ago. She arranged to come 4
on last Sunday, but did not put in an
appearance.
The mother of the unfortunate girl
is said to be in a state of mental col- 4
lapse, verging on insanity. An autopsy
was performed last evening by Dr. g
/.abala. a.ul the result determined that
lysol was the agent of death. Accord- g
ingr to the statement of friends, the priii
was but 17 years of age, but her family
gi . es her age as 19.
no such thing as coffee lying on the

The steamers of the new line will dock
at the Oceanic wharf and all supplies tor
their outward voyages will be purchased
here. Captain Howard, the able super
intendent of the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany, will handle the steamers, bo they
are sure to get good dispatch and be well
cared for. John D. Spreckels & Bros.
Company will be the local agents for the
new line.
If matters progress as well as is antic
ipated the Kosmos Company will put a
line of Steamers, under the German flag,
on the run between San Francisco and
the Orient. Leudal M. Gray, general
agent of the {Cosmos line, leaves for

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Aug. 10.â Wheat displayed more
i steadiness at the opening than conditions
! really warranted. Temperatures were reported
I from the extreme Northwest low enoueh to
cause some apprehension of damage by frost
j In minds of local traders, and this caused a
1 moderate amount of covering by shorts, re
sulting in a brief display of strength. Sep-
I tember opened a shade higher at 70(S70^c; De
: cember opened unchanged at 72c and advanced
to "2%c. It was evident, however, that in the
; Northwest no fear of damage was felt, the
, markets in that section being comparatively
weak, and the Weather Bureau report later
! dispelled all fears by predicting warmer
weather. The Inclination of bears to continue
pounding the market was strengthened, and
under rather free selling by the professional
i element prices slowly but surely sagged. The
Inevitable dull period during the middle of the
session found the market at its weakest, prices
being under puts, and even then receiving but
little support. December sold down to 71> s c.
and September to ti'J'.se, around which prices
: hung for some time. Around noon the market
brightened un a little on the reports of port
clearances, 270,000, and Indications for good ex
port business to-morrow, and later the market
became positively strong and advanced rapidly
: when a shari> advance In grain rates to take
effect September IS was announced. September
advanced to 70%@70V4C and closed at 7i>%c; De
cember advanced to l 'n'i2\c and closed at
72>ic.
Corn was Irregular with a fair amount of
business. The market was weak for September
I during the morning and continued liquidation.
Later buying started on complaints of dry
weather in Rome of the moat Important corn
producing States and on the announcement of
an advance in grain rates. September closed
He higher and December closed Vie to %c
I higher.
! Oats were slow but firm. September and De
cember each closed %c to "^c higher.
I Provisions were heavy and closed at slight
i declines. The market was Influenced early by
the train weakness and did not rally. The
shipping demand was poor and Liverpool re
ported declines. There was scattered Septem
ber liquidation all day. At the close Septem-
I bor pork was 5c lower, lard 2%c lower and ribs
. a shade lower.

The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"There has been somÂ« difficulty of late in
marketing Hay by rail. Because of heavy
shipments traffic has heen somewhat blocked,
so that now the tracks being full in the rail
road yards on this side of the bay. much Hay
\r- held over In th>' Oakland yards. The re
ceipts by rail to-day show the result of this,
five cars being the total new arrivals.
"As the season advances mort shippers are
getting rather anxious and are hurrying their
Hay to market or putting it under cover. It
will take fully a month longer to get matters
in proper shape. ,
"The cheaper grades of Hay are more in
evidence right now than they have been since
the opening of the reason. A car of strictly
choice Wheat Hay Is somewhat of a rarity
now, the bulk of the arrivals being from fair
to good Wheat and Oat Hay. In fact, we
cannot quote definitely on a gilt-edge article,
for thus far this week It Is not to be had in
the market.
"For the immediate future of. the market our
idea Is that both choice Wheat and choice rea
or black tame Oat Hay will sell readily and
for fair figures. The medium grades will proD
ably decline somewhatâ perhaps 50c per ton
from the present range. Alfalfa is dragging
under heavy receipts, and we fear We may see
somewhat lower prices for this particular
grade also."

Coffee in itself contains no nourish-

spoons of Grape-Nuts food are added
to a cup "i coffee, a new flavor" is
found and the best of nourishing food
obtained.
It is a novel experience in food and
drink and worth trying. People who
cannot digest coffee will find Postum
Cereal Coffee, when properly boiled, a
charming beverage with coffee taste
and color, but with great food value,
being in reality a food drink. Grape-

a dispute between the park management
and the owner of the horse. The trouble
arose over a misunderstanding as to

Gentry drew his horse, the management
protesting and leaving the matter in the
hands of the judges.

way, and the final heat, which took the
race in 2:03%, enualed the track record,

greatest enthusiasm. After the first heat

NO ASSURANCE OF
CUBAN INDEPENDENCE
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30.â President
McKinley's proclamation announcing the
taking of the < a census having been
published In Cuba to-day by Major Gen
i ral Brooke was made public at the White
House to-day. Those who had expected
to find in this message a char outline of
tin policy of the administration in deal
ing with Cuba will be disappointed. The
message is very brief. It gives no ex
assurance of national independence
for the island. The President's reference
to ill- establishment of an efficient system
O f self-government will generally be con
strued as an Indication that national in
dependenci is contemplated, though it
might be interpreted as looking only to
local Belf-government under the supreme
authority Of the United States. This is
the t roclamation:
EXECUTIVE MANSION.
August 17, 1899.
To the People of Cuba: The disorganized
condition of your island, resulting from the
war and the absence of any generally recog
nized authority aside from the temporary mili
tary control of the United States, have made
it necessary that the United States should fol
low the restoration of order and peaceful in
dustry by giving its assistance and supervision
to the successive steps by which you will pro
ceed to the establishment of an effective system
of self-government.
As a preliminary step In the performance of
this duty. 1 have directed that a census of the
people of Cuba be taken and have appointed
competent and disinterested citizens of Cuba
as enumerators and supervisors. It is impor
tant for the proper arrangement of your new
government that the Information sought shall
be fully and accurately given, and I request
that by every means in your power you aid the
officers appointed in the performance of their
duties. WILLIAM McKINLEY.

hostilities are being carried on In commis
slons. To-day thÂ»> passenger men got to-

$."> commission to Denver on all second

The action was prompted by the St.
! Paul's "red circular" requesting ticket
:ie--nt^ to Inform the passenger depart
ment of that mad of the sale of the first
ticket by Its new midland tourist route.
The circular, whil<- It does ii"t specifically
promise prodigious commissions, is taken

thorized '"onimissiirns will !>â¢â¢ paid.
The chairman of the Western Passenger
Association claims that under the agree

would pay the commission to Denver was
Irregular, and be has refused to accept it.

SAYS COURTS CANNOT
MAKE PEOPLE HONEST
OAKLAND, Aug. 30.â "A court of jus
tice must decide a case as to the !;i\v,
but cannot make people honest," casually
remarked Judge Ellsworth in banding
dcwn a decision in a rather Interesting
foreclosure suit, to-day.
The suit was that of Alfred Croker
versus Frank S. Cheeseman, lather of
the murderer Frank H. Cheeseman, wiio
escaped from Napa and. is now believed
recaptured In Montana. The mortgage In
question amounted to $7(Xi. covering the
Cheeseman residence in Berkeley, and At
torney K. L. Simpson, on beha
Cheeseman, set up the cluim that the
property wa.s a homestead, contending,
therefore, that without iis abandonment
no mortgage would hold good.
Congressman Victor Metcalf appeared
as attorney for Croker, and declared that.
Cheeseman uad homesteaded the prop
erty tirst, anrt without informing Â«he
mortgagee, subsequently mortgaged \lie
same. Together with attorney's fees and
costs Croker sought to recover $SSO.
Judge Ellsworth gave a personal judg
ment for the sum sued for, but decided
that the mortgage waz no lien on the
property, Incidentally making the remark
quoted above.

WHY HOAG AND
CAMP ARE ENEMIES
An interesting case was partly heard in
Judge Mogan's court yesterday, the com
plalning witness and the defendant being
well known in New Yorkâ the former as a
journalist and the latter as the son of a
millionaire.
The charge was threats against life, the
complaining witness being F. S. Camp,
outside agent for the American Export
Association in this city, and a Journalist
known under the norn de plume of "Wink
ley P. Swift." The threats were alleged
to have been made in the Davy Crockett
saloon on Market street on August 22.
The defendant is R. H. Hoag, who lives at
526 Eddy street.
Camp in his evidence testified that he
knew Hoag in New, York, and they used
to chum together and have jolly times.
He had not seen Hoag for some years till
a few months ago. when he met him in
this city, and at his request he went to
live at his house on Eddy street. Hoag
at that time was agent for a chewing gum
company. Hoag had collected money
coming to him and had never accounted
for it and he Instanced an account of
$12 50 collected by Hoag from the Cali
fornia Fireworks Company. Hoag h:-td
also got an overcoat from him valued at
$40 On August 22 Camp and H. J. Bar
nett the architect, were in the Davy
Crockett saloon, when Hoag entered and
grossly insulted him. finishing up by tell
ing him to arm himself, so as to he pre
pared for their next meeting. As he did
not consider it necessary or judicious to
carry a revolver, he had applied to the
courts for protection.
Barnett and K. \V. Joy were put on the
stand as witnesses for the prosecution,
but their evidence was incompetent and
immaterial, as they did not hear any
threatening language used. Alexander
Loughborough Jr. was also called as a
witness as to an alleged threat made by
Hoag against Camp a few days previous
on Van Ness avenue, but he was unable
to throw much light on the subject
Hoag in his defense stated that he knew
Camp in New York, but there was no
great degree of Intimacy between them.
When he drove in his carriage in New
York Camp used to accompany him and
hold the reins till he had finished his calls.
He met <'amp on Third street some
months ago. He was in rags and he took
pity on him. He consulted his wife, and
th*i result was that he invited Camp to
come to his house and live with him, and
he gave him $15 for pocket money, besides
supplying him with two suits of clothes
and a pair of shoes to make him appear
respectable. He paid his bills at different
restaurants and also his laundry bills,
amounting to $15 per month. He charac
terised him as a professional dead beat.
He denied threatening to kill him but ad
mitted that he said he would lick him.
Camp had been thrown out of his house
owing to his drunken habits. Hoag In
dignantly repudiated the insinuation that
he kept a lodging-house. He said his
father was n millionaire in New York and
owned blocks of land and houses In
(â¢range N. Y. His brother-in-law was
Prepiclent Hlnes of the Manhattan' Oil
Company. It wan not necessary for him
to collect money belonging to Camp or to
work as he had an income of *"><X> per
month from property in New York. Re
garding the overcoat, he said that <~"amp
had pawned it for $.? and asked him u>
get it out <>t" pawn. He did so, but the
next day it was stolen out of his carriage.
The case was continued till Friday to
enable Hoag to subpena the clothiers and
shoemaker who fitted out Camp at his ex
pense.

LIBERAL SUBSCRIPTIONS
FOR PENIEL MISSIONS
The announcement made in The Call
yesterday morning that the Peniel Mis
sionary Convention, in session at 49 Third
street, would be addressed by the evan
gelists, A. C. Bain and William E. Black
stone, brought a large number of people
to hear them. The hall was crowded at
both the morning and afternoon meetings,
and at the evening meeting, when the
Rev. Mr. Blaokstone began his address
on the subject of "Our Responsibility to
Kvimgelize the World," there was hardly
a place even to stand to be found in thÂ«
hall.
At the conclusion of his address Miss
Eva Shearer, who has been engaged in
the Peniel mision work for the past seven
years in this and other cities in Califor

that as soon as the way was opened she

BABY ESTHER SACRIFICED
TO LAW-BREAKING
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 30.
Had the city ordinance been obeyed by
the Southern Pacific street-car line in this
city, it is probable th*t little Baby Es
ther Wahlstead might now be living. She
was killed on Alcatraz avenue, but the
motorman of the car, who was the only
employe on board, says he knows nothing
about running over the child, although it
occurred in broad daylight before 6:30
last night.
Some months ago the City Council
: passed a law for the express purpose of
j avoiding such accidents as the killing of
Ksther Wahlstead. It was made illegal to
j run a car in the city without having two
: employes upon it. As several lads were
| then being employed on branch lines as
i conductors where the traffic is light, the
I ordinance was made so that one of the
employes might be under 18 years of
age. This was done to prevent throwing
several lads out of employment. The law
; has been obeyed by every car line in town
i except those owned by the Southern Pa
cific. When the branch line on which last
night's fatality occurred was opened sev
eraJ years ago it was not within the lim
its of the city, and therefore was at lib
â  rty to run with one man. When the ter
ritory was annexed to Oakland the prac
tice of saving a boy's wages was kept
up, with the result that the motorman
has killed a human being with his car
and declares that he did not see it done
and does not know how it occurred.
An investigation of the tracks shows
j that the child was first struck almost
; abreast of her home and was carried 1000
j feet across Shattuck avenue before the
i lit tlo corpse was disentangled from the
! wheels. Not until the return journey did
I thr motorman see the body on the track.
I The cars running on the Alcatraz-avenuÂ©
tir;inch hay.- no renders. They have the
i old clumsy pilot-board arrangement which
1 has proved its ability to maim everything
I it strikes while net even having the power
to keep mutilated bodies off the track. All
I the cars of the syndicate line are supplied
â  with the wire scoop fenders and have
' made a long record of successes in picking
I up bodies with comparatively little harm
to them.
The three-year-old baby killed last night
would easily have been scooped up in one
I of these fenders with probably no more
i damage than a few bruises. There Is a
city ordinance requiring adequate fender?
on' cars, but this law has also been dis
obeyed on the ..leatraz-avenue branch.
The Coroner's deputies have made a
j thorough investigation of the circum
i stances under which the baby was killed,
I and the inquest will be held to-morrow
j evening. ________________

Acme Club Attached.
OAKLAND, Aug. 30. â Abrahamson
I Bros, have caused an attachment to be
levied upon The furniture and fixtures of
the Acme Club, located in their building
on the corner of Clay and Fourteenth

was going to Bombay, India, to take
the place in the Peniel mission established
there some two years a#o made vacant
by the death of Mrs. Leach.
'Some one present suggested that a col
lection be taken up at once to provide the
means for her going. This was done, and
to the delight of the friends of the work
|g4O 80 was contributed.
Miss Shearer will start for her new
post of duty some time in the latter part
of September or October, with probably
one other fellow-worker for Bombay and.
one for the mission at Port Said. The
convention will continue in session to-day
and to-morrow.
Wrong Done the Waiters.
The Pacific Coast Waiters' Association
denies the statement that there is any
controversy between its members and
Caterer Abrams, who had charce of the
breakfast given to the soldiers at the
ferry depot. As there is no waiters' union
in this' city the impression got out that
whatever trouble the caterer experienced
was due to differences with the Waiters'
\ssociation, which is not the fact. No
member of the association was employed
by Mr. Abrams.

SECURING PLACES FOR
OUR SOLDIER BOYS
Interest In trie worK nome; done for the
returned volunteers lias now centered
about the headquarters tent at Union
square. Th.- basinesa of the soldiers' bank
has pone ahead with â  jump, and Cashier
Glnty has had his hands full taking in
deposits from the volunteers. In many
capes the deposits have been for fairly
large amounts.
The employment committee is actively
engaged in the work of securing positions
for the California soldiers, and are meet
ing- with much success and encourage
ment. It is to be regretted that some con
cerns are taking advantage of the patri
otic spirit which prompts the committee
In its undertaking, and are endeavoring to
use it as a medium through which to ad
vertise their own business. Offers to hire
men by the thousands at pick and shovel

these offers come from employment agen
cies that' have -been unable to nil big or
ders for laborers because of the Mian
wages, .which the employers are willing
to pay. â 
The most satisfactory announcements
are those which come from the employers
who are willing to restore the positions
to men who left their situation* to hgnt
for their country's honor. Among those
who notified the committee yesterday that
they were inclined that way are the ll
mer-Rollins Company, which will take
back three men who left them to join the
First California; the Hieks-Judd -Com
pany, who are willing that C. M. Crozan
of Company C and C. Zander of Company
X should return to their employ as Boon
as they are mustered out of the service.
A. Merle. 68 First street, will take back
four men who left him to become soldiers.
Adolph Bobft of -68S IT." yes street, an
honorably discharged soldier who was
through the Philippine campaign, has been
referred to the employment committee by
Mayor Phelan. He is anxious to secure
a situation because he has fallen into tire
clutches of Cupid and Is engaged to be
married. His case will receive early at
tention, and If the committee ; * successful
in getting him a place the wedding will
follow very shortly, and It Is likely that
the <*oinniitttf>rr.(-n will be Invited to dance
.â¢it the ceremony.
Henkl's Business College notified the
committee yesterday that they had more
applications for clerks than they could
fill and thi>t they were in a position to get
situations for many men of the regiment
who might be fl'ia lined to do clerical work.
Mrs. Truesdell of 476 Prospect avenue.
Oakland, has addressed a letter to the la
dies in charge of the headquarters tent
at Union square, requesting them to assist
her in locating Frank E. Truesdell. The
writer states that he disappeared about
two years ago, and she is anxious to as
certain if -he enlisted in the army.
LEFT HIS FAMILY
AND WENT TO WAR
There is one member of the First Cali
fornia Regiment who did not return on
the Sherman, and If the statements made
by his wife are true, Uncle Sam should
be ashamed that the man is in his service.
Mrs. John D. Foley of 1151 Mission
street is the soldier's wife, and she as
serts that he went to fight for his
country, leaving her penniless to battle
against fate In a brave struggle to keep
her -ix little children from starvation.
It is more than a year ago that the
husband enlisted In Battery A. For some
reason he did not enlist under his right
name, but used that of John D. Farley.
His wife objected to him going to war
and leaving her to support their children,
but he promised to send her bis pay
regularly and to return as soon as he
had an opportunity to see the country.
On one occasion she received $10 from
Foil v. but that was all, and She has not
even heard from him since. He did not
return with his regiment, and when the
wife ir.aile Inquiries of bis companions,
she learned that he had re-enlisted as
a member of the Ninth Infantry.
Mrs. Foley has had a hard struggle to
keep the wolf from the door, and had it
not beer, for the leniency "of her landlord,
N. K. Mastt-n, and the kindness of Mrs.
Gavin McNflb, the woman and her little
children would have been in sorry straits.
The oldest boy, a lad of 13. has l "' 1 ' earn
ing $â¢'{ a week as a messenger boy, and
for la time this meager Income was all
that the family had. Mrs. MeNab In
terested herself in the case, and through
her Influence secured a position for Mrs.
Foley as a janitress. The work proved
too hard and sickness came to add to the
woman's burden.
At present the family is almost desti
tute. Their unfortunate condition forced
.Mrs. Fpifey to appeal to the employment
committee- at the Red Cross tent. She
did not ask assistance, but sought to have
the committee use its influence with the
military authorities to force Foley to
send a "certain portion of his wages to his
family otherwise she believes that he
should be dishonorably discharged from
the service. Mrs. Foley claims that
Captain Dennis Geary of Battery A was
cognizant of her husband's actions, and
of the fact that he enlisted under a false
name.

Ing yesterday afternoon adopted the fol

MEDALS NOT READY
But That Will Not Interfere With the
Banquet to the Volunteers.
At a meeting of the joint committee of
the Native Sons and Daughters of the 1
Golden West, held last night in the Cali
fornia Hotel headquarters, it was an
nounced that the medal committee of the
Grand Parlor had decided not to distrib
ute the medals as had originally been
proposed; that was. on Saturday next,
just before the banquet in the nave of the
ferry building to be given under the aus
pices of the Native Sons and Daughters.
The reason assigned for this change was
that time will not permit to obtain the
rosters and Jill out the certificates and
properly inscribe the medals. It ' is <x
pected that they will be ready for distri
bution by the 10th of September, but If
not then they will be before the muster
ing out of. the Calif ornians on the 21st
of the month.
This change of arrangements will not
interfere with the banquet, which will

JENNIE WEBBER
HAS GONE,HER
SUIT DISMISSED
Col. Sutherland Wins
Bloodless Victory.
ORDER MADE IN OPEN COURT
ATTORNEY CBOWXEY SAYS HIS
CLIENT MISLED HLNL
Odier Action Growing Out of the
Brench of Promise Suit Still
Before the Court for
Trial.
- - - â 
The scandal which arose over the action
institute by "Jennie Webber" against
Capitalist William J. Sutherland to â â â  - â 
cover $20,000 for breach of promise has
been officially closed. Yesterday, on mo
tion of the plaintiff's attorney. T. J. j
Crowjey.'Judge Daingerfleld : i missed the â¢
ca-so. and the defendant; accompanied by i
his attorney," Mr. Deal, left the court.
When the case was called Mr. Crowley
was ][t he representative of the plain
tiff present: lie arose and, addressing
Judpe Daingerfield. said that he begged
leave to inform the court that when he j
filed the action against Colonel Suther- ,
land he was misled by his client, "'She {
did not tell me the truth In any partie- j
ular," he said, "and ail this trouble could j
have been obviated had Colonel Suther- j
land called at my office In response to a |
request which i sent him. 1 have not ;
seen my client for some months. The last |
time 1 received word from her she was In j
.Los Angeles.'. 1 !
Mr. Deal ihen arose and said that Col- i
onel Sutherland was of opinion that the >
action was instituted for purposes of j
blackmail; which it was, he auded, and his |
client did not answer the summons sent j
him by Mr. Crowley; not understanding
the attorney's position; but did as any
man would have done under similar eir- ,
cumstances â prepared to defend himself.
He understood the matter thoroughly at
the present tinu-. he said, and consented
that the dlsmlsal might be entered.
Thereupon the order was made.
Although this ends th breach of prom- ;
ise suit, th.-re are others still pending i
which grew out of it. Conrad Fecker,
"Jtnnie Webber's" husband, claims dam
ages from Colonel Sutherland for the -
alienation of his wife's affections. That j
suit is still to be determined. Fecker
married his wife when she was known a-s |
Mrs. Amber J. Cannon and was himself |
phot for having forsaken Miss Lizzie Holt,
to whom he was engaged to l>e married at
the time he transferred his affections to
the Nemesis of Colonel Sutherland.
Fecker is wanted to testify against Miss
Holt; who is charged with an attempt to
murder; and "Jennie" is under indictment
for perjury for having verified her com
plaint against Colonel Sutherland under
oath. Therein she claimed that she was
unmarried. The records proved otherwise
{iv.d the Grand Jury to<;k up the matter.
Since then "Jennie" has been traveling. (

made with a l>ri>-f stop at Niagara
Falls, the distinguished guests were
in excellent spirits, and Ailed with
wonder at the vastnesÃ of the great

faculty, and they w< n filled with de
light over what they saw and heard.
"It is the finest building site in the
world," declared I>r. Wallot enthusi
astically. Dr. Wallol also went into
raptures over the Palace Hotel. "It
is grandâ beautiful," he said, "but
such a court, whi^h is its most beau
tiful feature, would n"t be possible in
Europe, owning to climatic condi-
of willful neglect. Decrees of divorce i

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 31, 3 899.
M. Pascal was also very favorably
Impressed with the university site and
greatly admired the view of the city
us seen from the bay.
Mr. Belcher, the English member,
was not on the original commission,
and therefore has not seen the eleven
designs which were selected at the
Antwerp session of the commission
from the 106 submitted.
"I came as Mr. Norman Shaw's sub
stitute," he said. "so. you see, I nm
completely in the dark as to the rela
tive merits of the designs which we
have t<> pass upon. I consider the site
very line, but of course wo had llttlo
opportunity to-day to makp a thorough
I;. 1 -;" ctlon, and I cannot tell very much
â¢ it until after I have examined
the designs."
"Th*> site is all right." said Mr. Cook,
"but 1 wish there was some water in
those confounded brooks."
He was assured that in a few months
there would be enough water in the
brooks to satisfy the most exacting.
The reception lasted from 3:30 until
10:30 o'clock, champagne punch and
cigars being served meantime, and
then the visiting architects were
driven back to the Palace under the
canopy of electric lights that blazed
the entire length of Market street.
M. Pascal is president of the Ecole
d< a I-u-aux Arts in Paris; Dr. Wallot
is a member of the Royal Academy of
Arts of Germany and the designer of
thi- famous Reichstag building; Mr.
Relcher is one of the great architects
of London, and Mr. Cook enjoys a
similar distinction in New York. The
CHINA WANTS
THE PROTECTION
OF UNCLE SAM
Local Business Men
Are Alert.
The project of certain moneypd men to
| organize a United States and China trad-
I Ing company, as published in yesterday's
; <'all, to control the bulk of the trade of
China, has excited much comment among
1 the commercial people of this city. The
I printed address <*f Ho Vow, the Chinese
I Consul General, was not fully compre
hended by many who saw it first, and it
was oot until yesterday that the full pur
; port of the document was understood.
< However, a number of far-sighted men
| recognized the fact that a suggestion made
by the representative of China was
worthy of more than a passing consid
eration and these men, with Ho Vow. now
nave the project started along the road
to success.
A move has been made to organize the
; company, which it is understood is liber
ally backed by the Chinese Government,
1 although the Consul General is acting in
bis individual capacity. In brief the pro
position is that if a company is formed
here with from live to ten million dollars
capital it can secure from the Chinese
â  Government about every trading, con
tracting and commercial concession that
i it sees fit to ask for. The reason for this
!is that the United States Is the only
nation which has not made an effort to
grab a slice of China in the general
scramble of other nations to expand ter
ritorially. To prevent total annihilation
as a nation, the Flowery Kingdom is
obliged to secure a commercial alliance
with Â»onw other strong nation, and the
only friendly Government has proved to
, be the United States.
The officers of the Manufacturers' and
: Producers' Association read between the
lines of Ho Vow's circular and were not
slow to see what an advantage to the
; manufacturing Industries of this coast a
i timely consideration of the document
would be. H^nco its directors authorized
i the president, A. Sbarboro, to appear at
the meetings to represent the association.
This he has done and his reports of what
: he has learned have induced the members
to keep him in touch with all that is be
ing done. That something has been done
besides talking Is shown by the fact that
at a meeting of a number of business men
! and capitalists held on Tuesday It was
decided to prepare an address which will
be sent to every commercial body in the
United States.
The address will set forth the fact that
i at the present time the vast bulk of the
' trade of China is going to the nations of
I Europe, and that unless the offer made In
directly by the Chinese Government to
American capitalists Is accepted, the
T'nlted States Is likely to lose what little
It has; that special favor will be shown
by the Asiatics to American flour, sugar,
oils, canned goods, manufactured pro
, ducts, agricultural implements, etc., over
! these products of other nations; that the
j rich products of the Orient will be turned
' this v;ay, if the conditions will permit;
and last, but not least, that every con
| cession, privilege nnd franchise that can
he asked will be free!"- given to Ameri
cans. This circular will not be ready for
I distribution for at . least a week or ten
; days. In the meantime local capitalists
j will not be idle In getting plans for the
1 formation of the company into shape.
other members of the party are: Mr.
Hoe. Mrs. Hearst's representative at
Washington; P. B. Tuzo. who holds
a similar position in Paris: Mr. and
Mrs. John M. Carre re of London; Mrs.
Belcher and Mrs. Tuzo.
To-day the commission will Inspect
the plans in the ferry building and
this evening they will be banqueted
at the Palace. Saturday they will be
the guests of the Harbor Commis
sioners on a trip around the bay and
a trip to Mount Taxnalpals, where they
will spend the night. On Sunday they
will be taken for another trip around
the bay and then go by special train
to Pleasanton, where they will be en
tertained by Mrs. Hearst. On Monday
they will be taken for a drive about
the city by Adolph Spreckels, winding
up at the (.'lift House, where they will
be guests at a luncheon given by the
American Institute of Architects.
The special object of their visit to
the university was to make a pre
liminary Inspection of the college
site. The party went over on the 1
o'clock boat from San Francisco,
reaching the university town shortly
before 2 o'clock. At the train they
were met by a committee of the
Berkeley faculty and taken In car
riages to the grounds, where the stu
dents, drawn up in line on the campus,
received them with enthusiastic
cheers. They were driven to the
library, whir.- a short address of wel
come was delivered by Professor 1.,e
Conte on behalf of the faculty, after
which the party was driven over the
grounds and returned to San Fran
cisco early in the evening.
J. A. Filoher, managpr of the State
Board of Trade, says that The Call is cor
rect In the statement that this is one of
the largest commercial and industrial
movements of the world.
"It is a recognized fact," said he, "that
China is one of the richest fields on the
globe for commercial enterprise, for her
resources arc as numerous as her terri
tory is extensive. European nations real
ize this and they havt- shown that the
only way that they can Ret into that field
Is to parcel out the country among them
selves. China's only hope for preservation
is to secure the protection of some other
nation and America is the only one she
can rely upon. No wonder that her of
fers are flattering, and the capital that
gets into this project will reap a rich re
ward. You may rest assured that the ar
ticle in The ('all this mornliiK has !>ef<n
telegraphed to the capital of every Euro
pean nation and millions of dollars will
be spent to get at the true inwardness of
the movement now in hand by the moneyed
men of this city. That the diplomats will
combat it is assured. However, 1 feel
that the shrewdness of Americans will
I be manifest In not letting this opportunity
| for golden returns go by unheeded. "'
A. Sbarboro, one of the successful bus
i lness men of this State, sees in the offer
' made an opportunity f"r the enlarging of
i the manufacturing industries of Califor-
I nia never dreamed of before by the ]<â¢â <<-
pie at large. San Francisco is the natural
gateway to the Orient and he says that it
; is certain, if the move Is successful, that
I the products of the Pacific Coast wouid
i have first choice with buyers in China.
Dr. Gilbert Held, who has resided in China
i for the past twenty years, and who is as
i familiar with its 'inside affairs as any
! American in the world, called upon Mr.
] Sbarboro yesterday to discuss oriental
! matters. While he speaks with a certain
J amount of caution still his remarks show
i that he Is thoroughly conversant with the
i situation under discussion.
"It is important," he said, "for people
at home to understand that the present
regime under the dictation of the Em
press Dowager is not opposed to progress.
She herself, during twenty-five years in
the regency that preceded the reign of
the present Emperor, was always regard
ed as favorable to progressive measures.
LI Hung Chang, her chief adviser, was at
I the head of the progressive party. To
! day she is only opposed to the extreme
drastic and Impracticable measures as
I proposed by the excited advisers of the
; young EmiK>ror. She is perfectly willing
! to have Improvements introduced into the
: country if they are really improvements.
Otherwise she will prefer those things
; which have come down from the ancient
past and have proved their fitness to the
Chinese life.
"Americans all along have been re
garded with favor by both the merchant
and official classes in China. Naturally
I the opportunity presented to Americans
is greater than that presented to other
\ nationalities; still the affairs of China are
1 in a critical condition and the present is
the time when Important decisions will
be made which will concern the future
position of other countries in the affairs
lof China. Whoever Is first on the ground
i will have the advantage. Whoever dllly
-1 dallies along, waiting for others to take
: the lead, will inevitably be left behind.
Americans as a rule are energetic and en
terprising, have- unbounded courage and
faith and are ready to see their opportuni
ties In all parts of the world. They are
realizing the great opportunities for ex
tension of trade and influence amid the
vast population of the Orient, and yet it
may be that through lack of combination
they will fall to secure their position in
the changes that are now taking place
In the far East, while other countries, by
promptness and the support of their own
Governments, will secure a prior claim
and commercial advantage such as it will
I be Impossible for Americans to alter in
j the future. Thus far all the great con
i cessions, both in railways and In mining,
j have gone to the companies of other
countries. This means that the trade of
, other countries will also be Increased and
that the influence which other Govern
ments will have will also be Increased.
The future position of America in China
will depend on action taken within the
next year pr two."
PARRY'S DEATH
RESULTED FROM
AN ACCIDENT
Freedom Granted to
the Fair Widow.
SMILED WHEN DISMISSED
HER MOTHER, IS OVERCOME
AND SOBS IN COURT.
Testimony Tended to Prove That tho
Untimely Death Was Not
Caused Through
Malice.
Mrs. May Parry is a free woman. Yes
terday morning' Judge Graham dismissed
the case charging her with manslaugh
ter, and the young widow flounced out
of court, surrounded by smiling rela
tives and friemls.
Court opened with a gentlÂ« rebuke from
the Judge charging Attorney Knight to
see that th^ relatives Â«>f his client do not
in any way Interfere with tho family of
the late Frank Parry, for whose death I
Mrs. Parry was on trial. This brought
Knight to his feet with the explanation
that only his desire for a "full and fair ;
explanation" had not brought fonh from
him objections to the rjuestions put to
witnesses. "Why," said the attorney,
"the Questions I have allowed put to
witnesses without offering objections
have made me the laughing stock of the
entire San Francisco bar. Some may
have thought me only one degree above
an idiot. 1 only rise to protest now to
show that I know better."
"1 understand, Mr. Knight," his Honor
replied, and the case went quickly on,
t" end shortly afterward in triumph for
the client of the man who would show
he knew better. Only two witnesses were
called. Mrs. William Lyons, Bister of
the deceased, and Officer (Jillln. Captain
of Police in tho Mission district. Mrs.
Lyons' testimony waiÂ» in substance simi
lar to that offered by her sister, Miss
Mamie Parry, on Tuesday morning. She
repeated thu explanation Mrs. Parry bad
offered her relative to the shootingâ the
same old story of the accidental discharge
of the gun that followed the frienaiy
scuffle.
"My brother never explained the shoot- i
ing to me," Bald the witness. "The doc
tors said 1 was not to question him, and
besides I was never alone witli him. Mr.
Van Valkenberg was always around."
Captain Gillin in his testimony told of
the difficulty he experienced in getting
into the Guerrero-street house where the
wounded man lay. Van Valkenberg enn-
Bidered the shooting of Parry purely a
family affair, and resented the Interfer
ence of the authorities. "However," conÂ«
eluded the witness, "when 1 explained to
him that it was my duty to make an in
vestigation he let me in and I saw Mrs,
Parry, who told me how the shooting oc
curred."
I 'elective Fitzgerald substantiated Cap
tain Gillin's testimony. Fitzgerald testi
mony concluded the case tor the people,
whereupon Attorney Knight asked mat
"the case be dismissed upon the show
ins made by tne people." As the people
had not proved the very essential fact
that a murder had been committed, Judga
Graham dismissed the charge, mak
ing known his verdict by a brief "Defend- |
ant discharged."
Mrs. Parry took the verdict calmly, as
though she "expected no other result than
dismissal. Her mother, however, broke
down, rose up nervously, only to sit down
the next moment to wipe away a few j
tears that trickled down her lined and
strong face. Then her daughter kissed
her, and the whole band of black-garbed
women that have filled Judge Graham's
gaily decorated courtroom the past few
days, filed out.
Mrs. Townsend Thanked.
An unusual ceremony took place at j
the Presidio yesterday when the volun- j
teers were drawn up for the morning ]
review. Mall Clerk Sergeant A. Aitken
appeared with several assistants, who
delivered a wagon load of large en
velopes bearins the addresses of the
.â¢Ulcers and men of the First California j
Volunteers. Each envelope contained
a copy of the Wasp's splendid quarter
ly, and was a gift from Mrs. A. S.
Townsend, as the portraits of all the
volunteers were contained in the num
ber and also a profusion of pictures
illustrative of their exploits in the
Philippines. The generous lady's auto
graph was on each copy. She was
given three cheers by the delighted
volunteers. The Wasp has made a gen
uine hit with its quarterly souvenir
number. Tt has been compelled to run
off a third edition to supply the demand
from all parts of the coast.
