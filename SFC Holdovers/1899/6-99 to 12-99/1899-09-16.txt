THOUSANDS OF TROOPS, READY FOR WAR, PASS IN REVIEW
BEFORE GENERAL SHAFTER AND STAFF AT THE PRESIDIO
IMPOSING SPECTACLE
Brilliant Scene as the Soldiers of the Regular
Army Parade Before Cheering Crowds of
Enthusiastic Men and Women. .
Nearly 4^oo Men, Equipped in Every Way for
Immediate Service in the Field, March in
Splendid Array Past the Reviewing Post.
TKS air of the Presidio yesterday'
morning was athrill with busr'p falls
and the martial music from half a
dozen bands. Every one. soldier or
civilian, mounted or afoot, armed or
unarmed, was headed for the foot of the '
old parade ground, for It was the day of \
the big: parade, and those who were not j
going to take part w*iÂ» anxious to secure
a place from which they could see i: ai!.
There were three big regiments of inÂ» ]
fantry in line, five foot batteries o" artil- i
iery and a light battery and a tmop of '
cavalry. In -all there were nearly forty- i
five hundred mer-
It was close to 11 o'clock when General j
Bhafter and his staff and Governor Lind '
Of Minnesota and Governor Lee of South !
Dakota, with the members of their staffs \
who are with them on this coast, can- !
tered down the plain and took their places j
beiow the general hospital and in front i
of where the center of the line was to j
be. At the same time, with bands p'.ay- i
ing and colors fluttering gayly in the i
dust-laden wind, the regiments came |
down from the post and formed for re- j
view.
The foot batteries of the Third Artil- j
lery. under command of Lieutenant Col- j
onel Rar.aoiph. took the right of the line. â¢
their right tlank resting on the beach and !
the companies formed as a battalion in i
close column of companies. Next to the !
artillery was the Twenty-seventh Infan
try, under command of their colonel, j
and then in order the Thirtieth, under
Colonel Gardener, and the -Thirty-first,
under Colonel Pettit. On the left of the !
line was Light Battery C of the Third j
Artillery; commanded by First Lieuten- i
ant Gardener, and Troop G of the Sixth
Cavalry, under Captain West.
"Line of masses" was the formation, j
which, to the uninitiated, means a line j
of battalions, in each of which the four I
companies are formed in company front !
aixd one close behind the other. The bat
talions' were marshaled into line by First
Lieutenant J. D. Leitch. adjutant of the !
Presidio, and when the line had been j
formed he turned it oveY to its command- j
ing- officer. Colonel H. B. Freeman of the \
Twenty-fourth Infantry, commandant of
the PTesidio. Colonel Freeman had rid- i
den out In front of the line, accompanied .
by Captain Kimball. the post quarter- j
master, and Lieutenant McNair, the post j
.-Â£.-, v s**sSner3j
It was an Imposing sight. The lcrg
quadruple line'^reached from the water's â 
edge! right up almost to the tents of the j
volunteers.
It was straight as a string and as mo
tionless 8 as if petrified. The men were :
all in their blue uniforms, with campaign !
hats and leggins; there was nothing- gay ;
about them, but there was an air that j
meant business. The soldier, dressed for ;
â¢war. has a bearing that no amount of \
stripes or color can give him. and the |
command that turned out yesterday was i
in every way fitted for immediate service. ;
The Hne beirsjr formed. General Shaftcr. j
â with his staff Â£.r.d guests, rode around it, â 
the band of each regiment piping up as j
the party came past.
The reviewing officers then took the:r j
station in front of the center again* and j
the trcops were formed for the march ;
past. I"p from the beach came the artil- ';
lery. the band playing its liveliest, and ;
when the head of the column reached the ;
reviewing officers the Sand turned aside, j
and. stopping in front of the general, it â 
played while its own command was pass
ing by. The band of the Twenty-seventh
did the same, ard the other bands all i'ol
lo^red, each wheeling out to take the place j
of the other, which followed on after its i
own command when it had passed. [ It j
took some time for the column to pass, j
and then It was that the people began to j
realize the size of a four-regiment com- J
mand. There was no hitch, however, and j
the whole affair gave to many a new force j
to the phrase "military- precision." There !
was no stop and there was no delay, but
the long column, fifty front, seemed end- j
lees. and when the head of it had lost itself [
back in the post there were battalions still i
waiting their turn to wheel into column J
and follow on past the reviewing officers. !
The members of General Shatter's staff |
who reviewed with him were: General j
Ravrles. commanding the Third Artillery, I
who was with General Shatter by invita- |
tion; Colonel .brook, adjutant general;
Lieutenant Colonel A C. Ducat, aid: Ma- j
Jor Robert H. Noble, aid; Lieutenant Wil- i
son, aid: Colonel Maus, inspector general:
Major Groesbeck, judge advocate: Colonel j
Marshal, chief quartermaster; Major Gal- j
lagher, chief commissary, and Colonel i
Forwood, chief surgeon. The credit for j
the success of the review is due the com- [
manding officer of the troops. Colonel j
Freeman, and his adjutant. Lieutenant j
Leitch.
Lieutenant Colonel Ducat, recently ap- j
pointed to the Forty-ninth Regiment, has j
beer, ordered to report for duty at Jefter- j
son Barracks, St. Louis, where the head- ;
quarters of the regiment will be estab- j
llshed during the time It is being re
cruited. He will start East to-morrow or j

manded by Captain Wiliam H. Beck, j
Tenth Cavalry.

MILITARY RECEPTION IN
HONOR OF THE GOVERNOR
Officers of the First California
and the Heavy Artil
lery Entertain.
The military reception given by the offl- ,
cere of the First California Volunteer In- |
fantry and the California Heavy Artillery
in honor of -the Governor at the Occi
dental Hotel last night was a social and
artistic success and the most briliant mil
itary- function ever seen in San Fran- ,
cisco.
Practically the entire hotel was turned j
over to the committee of arrangements j
for the occasion ar.d under the skillful
direction of Chairman Chauncey M. St. '
John, assisted by Colonel Francis Bean |
and Colonel Joshua Uowell of the Gov
ernor's staff, Major Hooper's popular
hostelry was converted for the time being
into a grand rendezvous for battle-scarred
heroes and society buds and queens. The
former were there in all the glory of
gold braid, gilt buttons and gleaming
swords, and although their faces were j
less fair and their uniforms less bright
than those of the Governor's staff, the
ladies nevertheless appeared to prefer
their society. They were proud of the
soldiers home from the wars, and what
was more, they wanted to hear about the
battles that have been fought in the
far away Philippines from the lips of men !
who took an active part in them. The
officers of the three volunteer regiments
now hereâ the Callfornias, the South Da
kotas, the Minnesotas and a goodly num
ber of regulars â were there to impart the
desired Information, and they were kept
busy doing so.
The band of the First California Regi
ment serenaded the Governor as he en
tered the building at about 8 o'clock and
then contributed occasional selections in
the hotel corridors while the guests were
gathering for the reception. The entire
second floor had been canvased and the
hallways and parlors rendered beautiful
by lavish decorations of Sags, bunting and
potted palms. Numerous coat and cloak
rooms had been provided at either end of .
thÂ«> building, also several smoking-rooms j
for the special benefit of the weed-loving ,
veterans The main dining-room ha.'; been
cleared for dancing, with a platform
erected at one. side . for the orchestra,
while In the smaller dining-rooms at
either end and opening into the larger
room, tables were spread and refresh
ments served throughout the evening.
The reception was held in the grand
parlors on the Montgomery street side,
and began promptly at 9:15 the Governor
and his wife receiving under a canopy
erected opposite the main entrance. The
long line of quests entered at the upper
end of the parlors and were presented to
the Governor by members of the, reception
committee, the Governor in turn present
ing them to his wife.
The reception committee was composed
of- General and Mrs. W. H. Seamans, j
Captain and Mrs. William McKittrick,
Lieutenant Commander and Mrs. Charles
A Adams. Hon. and Mrs. Joseph S. Spear
Jr Mrs. Barnes. Captain John A. Koster, ;

empties. It was headed for Kansas City, ami as tho engine struck a trestle the structure gave way, precipitating
the engine into the ravine, twenty feet below, with the three men beneath. The tender and twenty-six cars all

having emerged from a cut and curve,
which had obscured the view ahead, he
crushed into No. .2. The engines of both
trains were badly smashed and the cars
on No. 2 were wrecked, but. strange to
say, nothing went off the track and "no
one was killed outright.
Fireman Williams was buried in his cab
beneath a pile of coal, which was thrown :
by Its own Impetus from the tender into
the cab when the trains came together. <
When dug out it was found he. had four,
ribs, his left arm and left thigh broken.

train, and will probably, not recover. En

cued Fireman Williams from under the
coal pile.
Engineer Penny stated that he had had
trouble with the cylinder of his engine
and forgot to stop at Clarks. Neither he
nor his fireman saw No. 2 until the col
lision occurred.
Engineer Wright said: "I saw the light
engine as It came out from the curve, and
immediately applied the air. reversed my
engine and tried to get off. but they came
together before I could get out of the en
gine."
It was Engineer Wright's prompt action
that prevented the utter demolition of
both trains. A wrecking train brought
physicians from Wadsworth and a special
took Dr. Gibson from Reno. The injured
men. except Williams, were seat to their
respective homes.

BRYAN LISTENS WHILE
BOURKE COCKRAN TALKS
Nebraskan Declines to Participate in
Debate aad So the New York
Statesman Proceeds With an
Address on Trusts.
CHICAGO. Sept. 15.-The exciting joint
debate looked for to-night between Wil
liam J. Bryan and W. Bourke Cockran on
trusts did not take place. Central Music
Hail was packed with an eager audience,
but the people present . had .to content
themselves without the oratory of the. fa
mous Nebraskan, who, however, occupied
a seat on lie platform.
Mr. Bryan reached Central Music Hall
early in the evening. He went direct to a
room upstairs, where -.- was greeted by
Chairman Franklin Head, Congressman
Gal;- â  Halph M. Easley and other mem
bers of the programme committee of the
Civic Federation Conference on Trusts.
Mr. Bryan surprised the committee by
declining to speak at the night session
with Cockran in accordance with the pro
gramme previously arranged. Mr. Bryan
explained that he did not wish to Jet the
Impression go out that he was to enter
into a debate with Mr. Cockran. For that
reason he said he would not speak with
Mr. Cockran at the same session.
Mr. Cockran was sent for and he and Mr.
Bryan discussed the situation. The com
mittee withdrew to allow the two orators
to settle the dispute among themselves.
Mr. Bryan asserted that he never said
he would follow Mr. Cockran with an ad
dress on the same evening. If the com
mittee got that impression from the con
versation he had with them over the long
distance telephone Thursday, he said,
they misunderstood him. Mr. Cockran
wanted to talk at the same session with
the noted Nebraskan and offered to flip a
coin to determine Who should have the
privilege of delivering the closing ad
dress. If Mr. Bryan would not accept
this proposition Mr. Cockran then agreed
to appear at any time the committee de
sired. The programme was to-night
changed to meet Mr. Bryan's wishes.. Mr.
Bryan said he was anxious to address
the conference and repeated that his only
reason for changing the programme was
to avoid any indication of a public de
bate with Mr. Cockran. Mr. Bryan will
speak at to-morrow's session.
Though disappointed In failing to see
such a spectacle as Bryan and Cockran
pitted against each other, the audience
enjoyed a rare treat, as Mr. Cockran was
at his best, and his speech was punctu
ated with frequent and prolong) ap
plause. When Mr. Bryan made nis ap
pearance at the entrance it was the sig
nui for tumultuous cheering, which lasted
until the Nebraskan had taken his seat on
the speakers stand. Mr. Foulke of Indi
ana, who was in the middle ol an address
when the outburst occurred, put the audi
ence in good humor by remarking: "1 j
guess you came here to-night to hear
somebody else speak." Mr. i-'uulke v.-as i
followed by Edward Rose water of Omaha,
whose address received notably close at
tent: from his hearers. â¢
The chair then introduced Hon. W.
lurke Cockran of New York. Mr. Cock
ran said in part:
1 shall endeavor, for this purpose of estab
lish:-., an Intelligent basis ot discussion, to be
somewhat trie Irom terms over which men
ha-.. become moved to passionate declamation.
1 shall define prosperity a.-< an abundance of
commodities fairly distributed among those who
produce them. We must have commodities to
distribute before we can distribute them in
the form of wages or of profits. Ii this defini
tion of prosperity be correct It is perfectly
plain that there Is no reason why a sensible
man should grow excited either to the ap
proval or resentment at a. combination merely
as such. A combination may be good or bad,
according to its effect. Any Industrial system
vhicTi operates to swell the volume of produc
tion should be commended; anything that
operates to restrict it should be suppressed.
Now whether these great combinations of
capital or these combinations of labor operate
to rai?e prices or to reduce them Is a subject
about which there has been a wide diversity
of opinion. There are some combinations which
operate to raise prices and some which oper
ate to depreciate them. It would be idle to
say that some improve, that some raise prices
and some depreciate them, if we did not pre
scribe some tost by which we could distinguish ]
between the two. Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I think It is a simple one, perfectly clear. The
test is to ascertain whether the combination
of capital nourishes through Government aid or
without It, for, my friends, you must see that!
any industrial enterprise which dominates the
market without aid from the Government must
do sq through cheapening the product, or, as
It Is commonly rajled, by underselling com
petitors. An industry which at one and the
same time reduces prices and swells Its own
profits must accomplish that result by Increas- !
ing the volume o{ its production. On the other
hand, an Industry which dominates the market j
by the favor of the Government, direct or in
direct, cannot, In the nature of thins?, be
forced to cheapen prices, because if It could i
dominate the market by underselling competi
tors in an kj en tletd without favor It would no; ;
. need the Government favor. (Applause.) The
inter:' â¢ i i of the Government would be an
Injury and njt a benefit to it. . An Industry
or combination of capita,!, or anything you
may choose to -nil it, that dominates a market
through a restricted competition that delivers
thÂ« consumer to it on Its own =ms necessarily
depends upon a narrow output and large
profits, extorted, not from thi excellency of
â¢Its service, but from the helplessness of those
with whom It deals. (Applause.)
Now. there arc three ways In which the
Government interferes in the trade of individ
uals In this country; one Is by patent laws.
The other means by which the Government
Interferes Is by tariff. Now, I believe that
every person can concede, whether he be
lieves In high tariff or free trade, that so
far as trusts are concerned, the tariff oper
ates to favor them In thiÂ« way and in this
; way only. It operates to restrict competition
In the production of any article to those en
gaged in It in this country. It >. if a trust
or combination Is to be (ormea, manifestly
it aids the enterprise when? the field of com
petition is originally limited. Under a con
dition of free trade every article which 1r
produced is exposed to the competition of the I
whole world. I:' you rely upon the combina
tion to suppress competition, manifestly it is
â¢ easier to make a combination between the
producers In ona country than in all coun-
.'â¢â¢Â» and to that extent the tariff favors.
(Applause.) There is still a third essential,
with which we can deal and which 1 believe
If vastly more -extensive in its results than I
'. fh!s tariff In favor of trusts. And ! refer
to those favors -which are extended to cer
tain Industries or from t!v- corporations, en
joying Government franchises which are none
the less Government agencies because their
Stock Is. own.'. l by private individuals. And
here we arÂ« la.--' to face with a serious dlf
"fieulty. First, I must assume It a serious
difficulty because It is almost Impossible to
discover It. It Is surrounded by secrecy. That
it is existing and does exist, everybody be
llevef. . . .
But, my friends, you must remember that
no person can enjoy favor at the bands of
any company enjoying a public franchise ex
cept at the expense of another. It is true of
every Instance where Government favors an
Individual. I have said In many places and
I say hen-, that government cannot at one
and the same time be a fountain of generosity
and justice. (Applause.) Government cannot
create anything. Now, If government cannot
â¢create anything It has nothing of its own
"to bestow. If it undertakes to enrich one In
dividual the thing It gives to him It must
take from another. (Applause,) If It do Â«
â¢ favor it must have a victim. And that gov
ernment only ii Just and beneficent which has
neither favorites nor victims. Now, I have
said that these favors are extended by
the common belief. and I have said
nnd acknowledged that If one parson at
tains rates that are excessively favorable, if
his 'goods are transported at a loss, why,,
other men using that same facility must make
good th". loss What is the remedy? Some
gentlemen have suggested municipal owner
ship. (Applause.) "
Ladles ana srentlement, 1 have no quarrel
with the ar>"lause for municipal ownership, I
concede the principle of It. (Applause.) The
Government has no right to empower Â«ny pri
vate ajtency to perform a function unless it
be one which the Government would be bound
:tÃ<li to perform If that agency were not to be
found. The only excuse for empowering a pri
vate corporation to discharge a public function
Is the excuse that the service will be more v
efficient. The question, then, of municipal
ownership Is a mere question of expediency.
1 1 era are many grave questions, to be con
sidered before .a municipal ownership could be
reduced to practical operation, even though
we would now set about the task. Now, Is
there any practical remedy that this conference
; ! can sucaest that can be put in force by any
. I legislature that happens to be In session? My
i friends, It seems to be a very simple matter.
; The fact is you would not have the task of
' I framing .-i law to denounce special rates to
, j Individuals; that is the law to-day. The rem
: edy is simply to deilne a practical penalty, a
' ! serious one. and to. provide for the proper
' I statute of publicity, nncl you need not enforce
I ; the penalty. An officer of a corporation grant-
I lnii a special favor to any person who has a
i r : ::!it to us.- that possession on equal terms
; with everybody else ought to be held guilty
h of a serious felony. (Auiilause.)
Now, with a statute authorizing and mak-
I Ing it the right of every shipper, of every per
son using a public franchise to have disclosed
to Mm at any time every contract and agree
! ment made with any other person you will
. I find there will be little difficulty about avoid
. ' Ins the enforcement of the renal statute, for
! it will not be transgressed. We want a simple
1 statute ot publicity, and I believe that will
â¢ chock the special favors.
i ' We do not object to the principle of co-opera
( ! tion. Corporate existence is the natural evo
' ; lutlon of partnership: it is a scheme by. which
! men, strangers to each other, can co-operate
; I In production, while partnership was a scheme
[ limited to men who knew each other and were
compelled to work together. But the manage
ment of corporations has been the blackest
IÂ«tre in our history. (Applause.) And the
. public Indignation, unfortunately, which ought
I to be expended upon the corporate management
which is responsible for this shame, has too
â¢ often been visited upon the stockholders and
i the corporations themselves who have been the
. victims of that infamy.
i To all this, my friend?, the remedy is pub
i licity. A statute which would modify but
â j slightly, if at all. the existing laws of every
â  I State would make this species of (raud ii:-;- c
; sibie. No corporation has n right to secrecy
' | In the discharge of its duties. No corporation
j anxious to perform h( nest service to the pub
-1 , lie and its stockholders will seek secrecy or
. will insist upon it. Remember that' this so
, j crecy is not Invoked by corporate 1 members
against the public any more than it is against
, their own stockholders. Ladles and ge.ntle
, men, we have but to provide a' single statute.
, â  First, that any stockholder shall' have the
right to examine the books of a company and
know everything about its concern*, although
he owns but one share. In addition â¢â  that
; every corporation should be compelled to file
1 with the Secretary of State when it organize*
a statement of property and to let the public
buy at any capitalisation It chooses to mak*
Every year It should report to some competent
authority a full rtatemen: of its business. That
Is the law to-day In eenrly every State, and
it Is always evaded. The reports are mis
leading where th"y aro m : comprehensible. Let
these report! Ijp fair, honest statements of
1 their business and the; finally extend the pow
ers of your superintendents of insurance and ,
â  banking to .ill corpora tlona and let these, re
ports be verified, and then you will have hon- !
> est manage] â¢ â¢ â  of corporations!, and 1 promire
. you that this public distrust and hatred of ,
corporation entities will disappear from the I
â  minds of a liberty-loving people who are but i
seeking Justice, even through their prejudice.
(Applause.)
At the close of his speech the New
Yorker won the hearts of Ms listeners by
paying Mr. Bryan a few well chosen com
, pliments, which the Democratic leader
I blushingiy acknowledged. Mr. Cockran
likened Mr. Bryan to a monopoly, and
claimed he was a bigger monopoly as the I
leader of the Democratic party than any
financial corporation in the world.
Mr. Cockran spoke for about two hours,
and when he concluded cries for Mr Bry
an came from all over the house. Finally i
Mr. Bryan arose and said that for Â«he
good of the conference all partisan feel- <
Ing should be eliminated from the gather
ing, and although he agreed with Mr.
Cockran on many of his arguments it was;
necessary that his side of the controversy
j should be given to-morrow.
DREYFUS TO PAVE THE
WAY FOR A PARDON
He Will Shortly Withdraw His Ap
peal for the Revision of the
R<?nnes Trial.
LONDON. Sept 19.â M. de Blowttc, tho
correspondent of the Times, Bays:
"I learn that Captain Dreyfus will
shortly withdraw his appeal for a revision
of the Rennes trial, which will^ leave the â 
ground clear for the Government to take
I immediate sti pa to pardon him. This par
i d<m will not annul the civil and military
; consequence* of the verdict, and he will
j therefore no longer helong to the army.
"There is nothing, however, to prevent
him from applying to the Court of Cas
sation to quash the Rennes trial whenever
! the new fa.'t required by law is produced.
When liberated he will stttie in the south ;
of France, as the members of his family
' <lo run wish to expose him to such demon

LONDON. Sept. lfi.â The Paris corre

Premier, M. Waldeck-Rousseau, has
promleea definitely to propose a pardon
for Dreyfus at next Tuesday's Cabinet

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1899.
REBELS MARCH TOWARD
VENEZUELA'S CAPITAL
Serious Condition of Affairs Reported,
Showing the Need of the Detroit to
Protect American Interests.
PRESIDENT ANDRADE OF VEKEZUELA.
Hp ha? started for Valencia to personally take command of the troops In
the Reid against the revolutionary leader, Castro. It is his intention to sum
marily put down the revolution.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
Sept. 15. A serloue condition of affairs prevails in Venezuela, according to
advices received by the State Department to-day from its agents in
thai country. Consul Luther T. Ellsworth, stationed at Puerto Cabello,
cabled to the department that the report was current that after a battle
General Castro's forces had occupied Valencia in the province of Carabobo,
driving the Government forces out. This Government has a consular agent at
Valencia and it is presumed that Mr. Ellsworth has called upon him for a
repi rt.
Mr. Russell, the American Charge d'Affaires at Caracas, cabled the de
partment in confirmation of the Herald's advices that President Andrade had
gone to the front to assume personal command of the Government forces in
the field, and his dispatch Indicated that a critica) condition of affairs exist
ed. He requested that the movement of the cruiser Detroit to La Guayra
be expedited in order that American citizens and their interests might be
adequately protected. .
Valencia, which the insurgents are reported to have occupied, Is con
nected by railroad uith Caracas, and its occupation indicates that the in
surgents are making progress toward the capital with a view to its cap
ture. Senor Pulido, Venezuelan Charge d'Affaires, is confident that the re
bels will be subdued by the Government forces.
The dispatch from Mr. Russell was referred to Acting Secretary of Navy
Allen. That official could take no action, however, in view of the fact that
the cruiser Detroit is now on her way to La Guayra and is expected to have
reached that point to-day. It was reported this afternoon that the Detroit
had arrived at San Juan, but officials have no information to confirm this
report and as the cruiser was ordered to proceed directly to the Venezuelan
coast, they do not credit it. Upon arrival at La Guayra, which is the sea
port of Caracas, Commander Hemphill, commanding the cruiser, will co-oper
ate with Mr. Russell to provide adequate protection for American interests. .

issued for his arrest to-night on a charge
of perjury, preferred by Mrs. Ella Smyth
before City Recorder E. Gardner. The
warrant was placed in the hands of Con
stable Ueorge Agnew for service, but at
a late hour Agnew had not succeeded in
locating Cochrane"s whereabouts.
It is alleged In the complaint that Coch
rane willfully, falsely and corruptly swore
thai he had served papers upon her which
were never served. It appears from state
ments of Mrs. Smyth, the plaintiff and her
husband, Attorney Charles W. Smyth, that
on September It), lsstiS, she bought from
Mrs. Mary F. Defiennes and H. J. Defien
nes, her husband, a piece of property sit
uated on the Reservoir road in this city.
At the time the property was purchased
it was mortgaged to John C. Dickson for
$350.
On April 25. ]SO9, Dickson commenced
foreclosure proceedings against the prop
erty. On April 27, 1899, M. F. Cochrane,
who is a brother of James W. Cochrane,
the attorney In the action, served upon
Smyth a copy of the summons at the
latter'^ residence, but neglected to serve
them upon his wife. On August IS. 189SK
James W. Cochrane had a default entered
against Mr. and Mrs. Smyth and Mr.
and Mrs. Defiennes and the suit dismissed.
Judgment was entered and M. F. Coch
rane was appointed commissioner to sell
the property. Cochrane swore that he
served the papers in the case on both
Attorney Smyth and his wife on April 27,
1899.
The defendant, M. F. Cochrane, sought
District Attorney Me Isaac to-night and
tried hard to persuade that official not
to permit the comnlaint to be filed. He
said that his wife was witn him when he
served a copy of the summons upon Mrs.
Smyth and her husband. At the same
time to another person Attorney James
W. Cochrane stated that a gentleman was
with his brother when the summons was
served, while Mrs. Smyth herself asserts
that Captain H. A. Gorley told her John
C. Dickson was with him when the sum
mons was served.
On account of these conflicting state
ments made by the interested parties and
others, District Attorney Mclsaac refused
to interfere. Arthur Scott had Smyth
arrested a few days ago for obtaining
money under false pretenses, but the af
fair was settled and the case dismissed be
fore th-- warrant could be served. Coch
rane, who had tried to collect the bill,
duly embraced the opportunity to "roast"
Smvth in the Bulletin, for which paper
he has been corresponding.
The trouble between Smyth and Coch
rane first arose from Cochrane's duplicity
in giving the three morning paper corre
spondents a story detrimental to Smyth's
interests. It was sent to the Examiner
by W. J. Eden, who also acts as corre
spondent for the Evening Post. Cochrane
gave the story to the telegraph operator
to be sent to the Bulletin as an evidence
of his good intentions, and afterward
slipped a note, to the operator telling
him not to send the story to the Bulletin.
By this procedure he evidently expected
to' get Smyth roasted and would himself
escape any trouble that might follow.
The trick was discovered In time, al
though the story went to the Examiner,
but was not published.
Cochrane afterward told Smyth and his
father and wife that he had saved
Smyth's reputation by persuading the
newspaper representatives not to use the
story. When Smyth discovered that he
was" getting the double cross he became
so angry that Cochrane was chased out
of his office with a club on attempting to
collect the bill of Arthur Scott.
"I can prove the truth of my charge
that Cochrane has commit*' -d perjury by
two persons." said Mrs. Smyth to-night.
"My husband and my sister were both

his cross-examination of Ex-Senator
Burke and he pursued the lead till near '
adjournment, â when he picked up some
thing from Ex-Groceryman McGovern
that greatly resembled a hot potato. At !
' any rate, the attorney for the once
: Buckleyite-turaed-reformer dropped it
in a manner to strengthen that belief,
' a glad smile stole ever the features of
McGowan, while Sammy fairly writhed
in his chair.
McGovern had been put on the stand
as a witness for Dunn and in response
to Questions by McGowan, he testified |
that Braunhart ha.l often brought up ;
the subject of Dunn's reputation.
"It is possible," said McGovern, i
"that I might have said Dunn was i
making- a fool of himself in the Legisla- '
j ture, but I never did say to Senator
| Braunhart that his reputation for hon
esty was bad."
On cross-examination McGovern said
! he had not told Braunhart in what way
! Dunn had acted foolishly. He said he
' did not remember that he had ever told
'â¢ Braunhart that Dunn had ever taken j
money for his vote as Senator.
"Did you have a private opinion,"
asked McEnerney, "that Dunn had tak- j
j en money as Senator?"
"Well, I did on one occasion/ was the
: answer, "when Senator Braunhart fur
; nished me the information."
"Did you get that Information from i
' anybody else?"
"No. sir; I did not."
In answer to further cross-examina- i
tion McGovern said that on one occa
sion after th- late primary. Dunn had
i called him to account for having com- I
: pared his Senatorial record with that i
! of Braunhart.
"There was a man there who was |
: talking about Braunhart," said McGov
i em. "I listened to him for a while
i and asked him what he had against
| Braunhart. He says: 'We don't want
; a Jew running In an Irish district.' I j
: says, 'Well, what else? Is that all?' !
\ and he says. 'Ain't that enough?' And i
! I said 'That is not sufficient to satisfy 'â¢
;me that you are right. Doesn't Sena- j
; tor Braunharfs record compare favor
; ably with that of Dunn or any other !
j of his predecessors?' "
McEnerney then proceeded to ques
'â  tion McGovern as to various cases In |
| which It had been charged Dunn was !
I concerned. The witness answered that I
i he knew of the alleged If. B. Curtis I
: jury bribery case and the Jack Wise i
'. green goods case only from the news- j
papers and did not believe that Dunn j
was guilty in either case. At the times j
â¢ when those matters were before the ]
1 public, -McGovern admitted that he was j
: busy reorganizing the Democratic j
party with Braunhart.
"In conversations with Braunhart."
said McGovern. "he often brought ud â¢
the subject of Dunn's record, comDar- I
; ing it with his."
"No, I didn't," said Braunhart. In an"
aside that could be heard a block away;
"he always compared it with mine."
Witness also remembered that
Braunhaxt told him that Dunn had at
; tempted to borrow money from several
| different parties for whom he had se
cured employment.
"In any of these conversations about
Dunn, suggested by Braunhart." said
Attorney McGowan on redirect exam
ination, "did Braunhart ever tell you
that Dunn's name was on the Exam- i
inees roll of honor?"
"No, sir."
"Didn't he tell you Dunn's, name was
on the roll of honor published in 1595 j
in the Examiner?" .â  .
"No, sir."
"That only proves," Bald McEnerney,
"that the Examiner gets wiser as it j
grows older."
â â¢Yes," retorted McGowan, "and that
times change."
On recross-examlnatlon McEnerney
called for the production of the affidavit
made by McGovern on September 12. j
It was produced and the trend of the j
attorney's question was to show that \
the Wharfinger was in a fuzzled condi- i
THE PAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1899.
Mr. Spreckels and his colleagues of the board of directors were lavish in
their praise of the work of the Citizens' Committee, which caused the fair to be
the unqualified success that it is. The following were the guests of Mr. Spreck
els: Frank Miller and J. O. Coieman, president and secretary respectively of the
Sacramento Chamber of Commerce; T. L. Enwright. W. F. Purnell, H. C. Fisher.
H. I. Seymour. Albert Elkus. Frank L. Gray, C. W. Morton and C. H. Holmes.
The following directors of the State Agricultural Society were also present be

also a guest.
â¢ Uoo from drink -when he made it and .
- know -*hat he was doing. Wit- i
! c nie<l that he had told Braunhart
he -was drunk when he made the am- j
j davit, although he did recollect that he
had said he did not remember what was
! in it.
Witness said that the most recent
i conversation he had had with Braun
: hart was on the morning before the
I Port Warden testified in the Hearst
i case.
What was it?" asked MeEnerney,
and after McGorern had detailed it he !
pped him uqickly.
"Braunhart told me he had been
I subpenaed in the case," said McGov
i crn, "and said he was going to use my
! name. I says "What are you going to
! use my name for?' and he says 'You
; are a reputable man,' or something j
j like that, 'Ar.d I am going to use your '
name a.s having said that Dunn's repu
tation was bad.' I says "Don't you do j
\ it. because you can't verify it. I never
mid Dunn's reputation was bad, or
anything of the kind.' "
Braunhart did use McGovem'a name
after that and that is why he is ac
:. H<Â» also used the name of ex
j Senator Bart Burke, who also testified
; last night that he did not recollect ever
I having said anything to Braunhart
i about Dunn's character.
McEnerney gut from Burke the fact
that the ex-Senator and Braunhart
had had a conversation at the Baldwin
Hotel in 1596. at which Braunhart had
j asked him for pointers on the hold-over j
i Senators and at which the "railroad"
! and anti-railroad proclivities of the
1 men under review were discussed gen
erally. Burke entirely failed to recali
any references that had been made to
j Dunn, and was inclined to the
that the name of that Senator had not .
| come up, notwithstanding the fact that
i Braunhart had so /worn in the Dunn-
Hearst case.
McEnerney took the ex-Senator back
to the days of the session of '95 and
| tried every possible method known to !
I the crose-examiner to draw from him ;
i something that would support his case. ;
i but Burke, while he had had his own
i opinions concerning Senators who were
j railroad and others who could be j
I "reached," was loth to state that he :
' had mentioned Dunn's name to Braun
i hart as one of them. He said he had
: some recollection of the charge that
Senator Biggy had made at that ses
sion that Senator Dunn had approached
j him with a proposition to go into a :
i combine for money. He said he re
: garded Biggy as a truthful man. but ;
' had heard nothing of the evidence be
â  fore the committee and knew the mat
had not been pushed.
"Did you ever alter your belief that
Bigey's statement was true?"
Burke paused a long while before he
! answered.
"I would rather be excused from
answering that question."
A low whistle sounded in the court
room, as If somebody had been sur
! prised. The court looked daggers, but
| could not find the culprit.
"I insist upon it," said McEnerney.
"I certainly think." said Burke, "that
Senator Biggy believed it to be true.
I think he told what be believed to be
; true. I don't know whether it was true
| or not."
On redirect examination Burke re
membered that in making the charge
Biggy had not mentioned any Senator's
name.
"In that Senate," asked McGowan,
"wasn't the test of railroad or anti-rail
i road, a Senator's vote on the back tax
; bill?"
â¢ 'â¦ was."
"lDtdn't Senator Dunn vote with you
on that bill?"
"Yes, sir; that's my recollection."

"Handsome** George Adams, who is be
ing sought for by the police in connection
with the criminal transactions of Howard,
the Australian piunger, Is now in Lon
don: After making a statement of his
connection with Howard to Chief Lees,
Adam got cold feet and skipped out.
Prior to hi* disappearance he was stop
ping at a hotel in San Rafael. He owed
considerable money to the landlord, and
rather than attempt to surreptitiously
move his baggage he left his wardrobe,
consisting of several suits of clothing and
a miscellaneous assortment of collars and
underwear, in his room.
Becoming suspicious of his actions and
concluding that he intended to â¢ - oeat"
him, the landlord took possession of the
articles, hoping that Adams would return
to claim them. After waiting for some
time and not hearing from him. the pro
prietor of the hotel concluded that he
had left for parts unknown. The police
were at once notified and they succeeded
in tracing "Handsome George" to New
York.

and g-ave out the impression that hÂ» was ,
a mining man in search of pleasure and I
recreation.
The following day ho left for London
after announcing that he did not intend to i
return to America.
The fact that Adams was amply sup
plied with money considerably worried
the police, as they knew that he was pen
niless when he suddenly disappeared
leaving his wardrobe in the San Rafael ,
j hotel. After an investigation they beram- 3
convinced that the money which enabled '
\ Adams to return to England was fi
nished by Mrs. Howard, the wife of the
"Plunger."
According to the police Howard was
1 anxious to get Adams out of the w.iv as
he feared that in case Adams was 'ar
rested he could be induced to tell what
hÂ» knows of Howard's swindling practices j
and his diabolical plot to murder Cap
italist Green.
"Bob" Creelman. the companion of
Howard, was closely questioned by
Lees last night as to the whereabouts of '
the much-wanted fugitive. He admitted !
that he had accompanied him as fir as j
Spokane, but denied that he knew hia I
present whereabouts.
"Eddie" Kauffman, whose name has
figured prominently In connection with
Howard, returned to this city yesterday
from N'"w York. Kauffman was met at '
the ferry by Detective Tom Gibson and
questioned as to the whereabouts of How
ard. He denied that he had seen him i
since h<* disappeared from this city after;
learning that warrants charg-ing him with '

Chief Lees and his men are hopeful of j
eventually catching Howard.

It Would Be Necessary for Him

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 15,â Dewey
land parade will move in Fifth avenue
instead of Broadway south of Twenty
third street, and will disband on the
south side of- Washington Square. One
of its strongest advocates was Rear
Admiral Philip, who declared that it
would be a hardship for the sailors of
the Olympia, unused as they are to
marching, to tramp down Broadway.
"They should be kept on asphalt pave
ments' the entire distance, if such a
thing be possible," he declared. .
General Roe said that there would be
10,000 visiting troops in line. Other
men in line, General Roe said, would
be from the navy 2000, army 2000, Na
tional Guard of the State 15,000, former
Confederates 1000, members of the G. A.
R., 15,000. veterans of the Spanish-
American war 2500.
General Carroll, after saying that the
plans for the naval - parade had been
completed, launched into a defense of
the administration, in view, he said, of
the attacks made by certain news
papers.
The President, General Carroll said,
had told him that as commander of the
army and navy, he would naturally
take precedence in military and naval
affairs over even Admiral Dewey. He
did not desire to detract from Dewey's
glory, so he would stay away.
Chief of Police Devery told the com
mittee he objected to the plan to drive
the admiral to Claremont Inn after the
ceremonies at the City Hall. He said
he thought that hundreds of carriages
would attempt to follow, blocking the
streets and interfering with the police.
He suggested that Admiral Dewey be
taken up town in an elevated railroad
train. There was a storm of objections
to this and it was finally decided that
the escort to Admiral Dewey's carriage
should be limited to four carriages.
It was announced to-day that the
main pyrotechnic display would be off
the Battery. Permission to use Gov
ernors Island has been obtained and the
fireworks committee also hopes to be
able to make a display from Liberty
Island.

STRIKE AT MARE ISLAND.

VALLEJO, Sept. 15.â Following 1 the re
cent cut in wages at Mare Island the
shipwrights refused to-day to work on
the San Francisco Bridge Company's
dredger, which is now in the dock.
Permfssion was secured from the au
thorities by the bridge company, but the

ing to work for the Government at their

TRANSVAAL CRISIS NOW
AT ITS MOST ACUTE PHASE
View of Lourenzo Marques, Delagoa Bay.
In this picture, which is from a sketch by J. Harrington, the Portuguese custom-house Is shown in the foreground
PRETORIA. Sept. IB.â At the
close of the discussion both the
ids met In secret session to
discuss the final draft of the
Transvaal's reply, which will be
handed to I'nnyngham Greene,
the British agent here, in the â 
morning. It is understood the
reply Is courteous, urges the ac
ceptance of the joint conference
and maintains the convention of
1884.
LONDON, Sept. 16.â special dis
patch from Pretoria says: The Trans
vaal adheres to the seven years' fran
chise law, but. Is willing to consider
and, if necessary, to adopt any sug
gestion Great Britain may make with
regard to the working of the law. In
regard to the other points of Mr. Cham
berlain's dispatch, the Transvaal bold
ly stands by the London convention.
It is said that the reply is couched in
polite terms.
State Secretary Reitz, in the course
of an Interview to-day, expressed some
doubt as to whether any alteration
would be made in the existing fran
chise law, but said he believed a way
should and could be found to estab
lish an arbitration court. As to suzer
ainty, the least said the soonest mend
ed, marked the State Secretary. \ "
In the forecasts of President Kruger's
reply there is undoubtedly a large basis :
of truth which seems to bring the dis
pute within a measureable distance of
war.
Last evening the Press Association
issued a curious statement to the ef
fect that as soon as the garrison in
Natai had been sufficiently strength
ened the Transvaal Government would;
be called upon to accept a new conven
tion, already drafted, which, while
guaranteeing the integrity of the
Transvaal State, provides for the de
molition of the forts and limits the
armed force of the Transvaal to a num- j
ber deemed sufficient to maintain inter- i
nal oider.
According to the Press Association.
the convention will demand that the
diplomatic agencies be suppressed and
the judiciary be made independent -of
the executive. This statment, which
realizes the extreme demands of the
out landers, must be accepted under re
serve at the present stage, hut it is not
unlikely to be a semi-official hint as to
the next move of the Government i
should President Kruger prove obstin- |
ate.
The morning paper editorials re
garded the crisis as having reached its i
most acute phase. The Dally News â¢
says: "We refuse to believe that Presi
dent Kruger is so foolish as to reject
Mr. Chamberlain's moderate demands."
The Daily Chronicle, which appeals
again to Mr. Kruger "to accept while it
is yet time and before England's terms
become harder," says: "A refusal of
the present terms will involve the ruin ;
of the State over which President Kru
ger presides. The British Government t
have played their first and second |
moves in the game and must perforce |
play the third and then the fourth. If
Mr. Kruger haggles the sinister condi
tions in South Africa will grow worse
until a catastrophe is reached."
Other papers talk of the imminence
of war, and all the dispatches from
South Afrit continue to describe the
military preparations on both sides.
The Pretoria correspondent of the
Daily Chronicle says: "The Boers as
sert that Mr. Conyngnam Greene, Brit
ish diplomatic agent at Pretoria, knew
it was their intention to adopt the at
titude they have regarding suzerainty
and that he tacitly encouraged thtm,
as the documents show. His forty
eight hour demand and the string of
blue book innuendos, for which he and
Sir Alfred Milner are responsible, have '
produced an official atmosphere In
which anything is possible. At the
same time Mr. Hofmeyer and practi- i
cally every member of the Cape Afri
kander party have wired, urging ac
ceptance of the British demands."
The Pretoria correspondent of the
Times, in his forecast of the Trans
vaal's reply, declares that the Boers
â¢will lay stress on the sever! years' fran- i
chise law. though offering to consider I
their suggestions as to its working and
for the rest take their stand in the Lon
don convention.
The Times says: "We cannot believe
that President Kruger will reject the J
latest proposals of the Government, and '
we would remind him that even Mr. !
Morley has indorsed the five-year fran
chise and urged him to accept the Cape
Town conference."
It is understood that a Cabinet Coun
cil will be summoned as soon as the
Transvaal's reply is received.
The Pretoria correspondent of the j
Manchester Guardian, telegraphing Fri- j
day, says: "The situation has become '
extremely grave. The material changes j
in the draft of the reply delivered to
Mr. Greene to-day are due to represen
tations from Bloemfonteln and the dis
patch is not of the Volksraad."
The dispatch then gives what pur
ports to be a summary of the reply,
which is similar to the other forecasts, |
concluding as follows: "The Transvaal
feels at liberty to depart from the Joint '
inquiry, which she accepted in the bona j
fide belief that it would lead to a final
settlement.''
The correspondent adds: "Both the
residents and the Executive Council
: â :<-â¢ firmly convinced that no finality is
: itended and that further concessions
â ould only postpone the struggle. The
Transvaal regards herself as tricked
into a proposal by Mr. Chamberlain.
The Orange Free State will certainly
stand by the Transvaal."
CAPE TOWN, Sept. 16.â The â  British
High Commissioner, Sir Alfred Milner.
has issued a proclamation prescribing
severe penalties for inciting natives of
Basutoland and other districts to re
bellion.
JOHANNESBURG. Sept. 15.â The
Eastern Star of Johannesburg asserts
that a martial law proclamation is be
ing: printed.
It is reported here that the reply of
the Transvaal to the British note will
suggest a seven-year franchise.
BRITISH BLUE BOOK
ON TRANSVAAL DISPUTE
LONDON, Sept 15.â A blue book,
containing the last Transvaal dispatch
of the Secretary of State for the Colo
nips, Mr. Chamberlain, relating to the
matters which led up to the dispatch
being sent, was issued to-day. The
text of Mr. Chamberlain's note is iden
tical with the dispatch as cabled to the
Associated Press September 13. The
only important new feature revealed is
a telegram from the British High Com
missioner, Sir Alfred Milner, dated
August 31, referring to the commercial
distress and saying:
"I am receiving representations from
many quarters to urge the Imperial
Government to terminate the suspense.
British South Africa is prepared for
extreme measures and is ready to suf
ler much more in order to see the vin
dication of British authority. It is the
prolongation of the negotiations, end
less and Indecisive, that is dreaded. I
fear seriously that there will be a
strong reaction of feeling against the
policy of the Imperial Government if
matters drag. Please understand that
I invariably preach confidence and pa
tience and not without effect. But if I
did not inform you of the increasing
difficulty of doing thip. of the unmis
takable growth of uneasiness about the
present situation and ot the desire to
see it terminated at any cost, I should
be failing in my duty."
Other lengthy dispatches from the
British High Commissioner are pub
lished, but they only reiterate the Uit
lander claims regarding the franchise
and the Commissioner's ideas on the
propositions already made.
Mr. Conynaham Greene, the Britisli
agent at Pretoria in a letter to the
Transvaal Government, said the Impe
rial Government did not desire to hurt
the Boer susceptibilities by publicly re
asserting suzerainty, so long as no rea
son to do so was given by the Trans
vaal.
The Globe, commenting on this letter,
expressed the greatest regret at such
language and trusts Mr. Greene's words
do not represent the attitude of the Co
lonial Office. The Globe adds: "The
blue book gives little encouragement to
the belief that the Boers will show
themselves reasonable."
JOHN MORLEY PLEADS
TO MAINTAIN PEACE
MANCHESTER, Sept. 15.â The Rt.
Hon. John Morley, Liberal member of
Parliament for Montroseburgh, while
addressing a peace meeting in this city
to-night, at which a son of the late
John Bright, the distinguished British
statesman and friend of peace, presided,
was frequently interrupted by cries of
"Majuba Hill" and other anti-Boer
demonstrations. Retorting to the inter
ruptions, Mr. Morley said :
"A year or two ago the United States
saw only an aspect of war; and what
are they to-day? They are repenting.
They have their yellow press and we
have, our yellow press. If I am asked
to speak in this hall a year or two later,
I shall find those who now oppose me
repenting also."
The proceedings finally became so
noisy that Mr. Morley had great diffi
culty in obtaining a hearing. He urged
adherence to the five-year franchise
proposal and advised President Kruger
to accede to Great Britain's suggestion
r"garding the conference.
If. Leonard Courtney, Unionist mem
ber of Parliament for the Bodmln Divi
sion of Cornwall, in seconding Mr.
Morley's resolution In favor of secur
ing reforms by pacific means, advocated
the p-mlttlng of the question of suzer
ainty to the privy council.
Mr. Morley's resolution was carried
by a large majority, the noisy minority
expressing its dissent by hoisting the
Union Jack.

George Mi Us Wounded
by J. McCullom.
BOTH MEN ARE EX-CONVICTS
TRIVIAL SLIGHT THAT NEARLY
ENDED IN MURDER,
Would-Be Assassin Taken Into Cus

Victim in a Precarious
Condition.
â¦
Shortly after midnight John McCul
lom, an ex-convict, shot and dangerously
wounded George Mills, who is also said
to be an ex-convict, and was placed un
der arrest by Officer O'Shea and is now In
the I'ny Prison awaiting the outcome of
his victim's injuries.
The shooting occurred on Sixth street,
and Is the outcome of a jealous quarrel
Mc-Cullom's wife had been drinking with
Mills- the night previous and in an unwise
moment told her husband. He became
insanely Jealous, and arming himself
went in search of his rival. He found
him coming out of a coffee house with a
man named Fred Grey, alias Wood and
after applying a vile epithet to Mills
pulled his pistol and opened fire The
first bullet lodged in the latter's foot, and
as he started to run away McCullom fired
again, th* bullet taking effect In the
groin. Before the assailant could do fur
ther damage Officer O'Shea rushed up and
took him into custody. The wounded man
was sent Immediately to the hospital
where his wounds were treated by the
physicians. While the latter do not think
Mills will (i IG , they think him In a pre
carious condition.
McCullom will probably be charged with
an assault to murder to-day.

PLETE.

Stage.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALISTOGA, Sept. 15.â There Is now
very little doubt In the minds of the of
ficers but that Joseph Weir, who was ar
rested last night, is the man who held up
the Lakeport stage. â¢

bloodhound was started on the trail. The
tracks were cold and It took the dog three
hours to cover the distance of a mile, but
but he brought up at the house occupied
by Joe Weir and was savage when he
reached the door. The officers returned to
town this afternoon satisfied that they
had t lie right man. They were unable to
find the gun, black hat and mask. They
j were probably hidden in the thicket.
H. T. Quigley, the driver, is here to
| day. He says he is positive that Weir
! stopped the stage, and knew so at the
time, but was unable to place the man
until he reached Mirabel mine. The pas
sengers. Rev. C. F. Coy and Newton Stith,
are here foi the purpose of identifying
the robber. Coy says he recognized the
man at once to-day. He paj-8 that during
the robbery the mask came down over the
highwayman's nose, and before it was re
placed he got a good look at the forehead,
eyes and nose. He says he never saw the
man before yesterday, but recognized him
to-day. Newton Stlth, who is acquainted
with Weir by sight, corroborates Coy's
statement.
The officers have given up further
search, as they are satisfied that they
have the right man. District Attorney
Bell Is here gathering evidence, and the
preliminary examination will be held
early next week. Weir's mother came up
from the city to-day. The prisoner as

pany would be the fifth organization of
the kind incorporated since July 10.

continue five days. This is right in the
midst of the fruit harvest, and it will
show off the county's products to good
advantage.
During the last ten years the Agricul
tural Society has been content with horse
races, and the fair part, ii which farm
ers and fruit-growers took such an inter
eat, was entirely abandoned. Now this
year it is to be the reverse. Every dol
lar of the State appropriation is to be
used for fair purposes.
The Santa Clara County pumpkin- and
other vegetables will be in evidence and
compete for ribbons and medals. The
products of farm, orchard and vineyard
will be shown, and the display will be
worth coming miles to â Fine catt!4,
crafthorses and brood mares. thor
oughbred swine, goats and poultry will
receive their share of attention, as will
the mechanical arts and handiwork of the
housewife.
There will also be racing, some of the
fastest horses now campaigning on" the
circuits having Urea been entered.
Good purses will be raised by subscrip
tion among the merchants.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 15.â Commissary

REGRETS RECENT WAR
RETURN'S WATCH OF THE LATE
LIEUTENANT LANSDAXE.
Was Convened to the Widow in This
City by Correspondent cf London.
Times, Who Also Visited

Fpeciil Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
WASHINGTON, Sept. 15.â The Presi
dent received ill audience at the White
House this afternoon John George Leigh.
who ..-- spent' several months in Samoa
as special correspondent of the London
Time* and is now on his return journey
to England. 'â¢â¢....â : in, one of the black
villages of Upolu Mr. Leigh learned that
a watch believed to have belonged to
either Lieutenant Lansdale or Ensign
Monaghan. the two officers of the cruiser
Philadelphia who were killed during thÂ«
recent war against Mataafa, had been
found and was in the possession of a na
tive. He at once communicated with Ma
taafa. whom, he had visited only a few
days previously, and promptly received a
reply from the high chief assuring him
that no ettort would be spared to recover
the relic, and begging him. should the
search prove successful, to restore the
watch to the rightful owner "with my
heartfelt condolences."
He added: "You know what I feel about
America, and the late unhappy war." At
the same time he placed at Mr. Leigh's
command his grandson and a boat's crew,
who were instructed to carry in every
necessary direction Mataafa's order to bis
adherents. While these messengers were
in the island of Savaii a watch and chain
with locket and other articles attached
were handed to Mr. Leigh and identified
as the property of the late Lieutenant
Lansdale.
a fe-w days later the correspondent left
Samoa for San Francisco, where he met
the young widow of the lamented officer
and placed the â â --.-.â â¢- in her possession.
Long ago. at the Instigation of his family
and of Lansdale's comrades m the navy,
unsuccessful efforts had been made to
trace the articles, so hope that they Â»ver
would be found had been practically
abandoned. Mr. Leigh this afternoon
handed to the President a letter from
Mataafa. of which the . following is a.
translation:
To his Excellency William sfcKin
ley. President of the United States of
Americaâ Tcur Excellency: I have to
day been .-_... . - a watch has
been found by one of my people which
is believed to have aged to Li-u
--tenant Lar.sciale or Ensign Monaghan.
who were unhappily killed in battle
at Valle c on April 1. I have learned
that Mr. Leigh is about to leave Sa
moa for America and I have asked
htm to convey the watch to your Ex
cellency, In the hope that "you will
cause It to be restored to the bereaved
mother or nearest relative of the brave
and much-lamented officer. Mr Leigh
will tell you that I have sincerely de
plored the sad. untimely death of the
brave officers and men who came from
America and perished in the late un
happy, useless war. Mv Borrow fa the
more because of the great friendship
which your zreat country has in the
past extended to Samoa. I am espe
cially anxious that this should be made
known to the sadly stricken mother*
and relatives. May i: be the will of
God that there may never again be
strife between America and the Sa
moar.s and that the three powers win
recognize my submission to their wil!
ar.d desire for srood government. I
pray God may give you long life.
T. J. MATAAFA.
v- McKlnl^y. In the course of conver
sation with Mr. Leig expressed himself
much gratified at this proof of Mataafa's
thoughtful humanity and said that it
would afford him more than ordinary
pleasure to personally respond to the let
ter. He very warmly thanked Mr. Leieh
for his action in the matter and for hav
----- conveyed the relics to Mr*
L&ns.iale. When Mr. Leigh left Samoa
active endeavors were beine made to re
cover Ensign Monaehan's watch and Mr
Leieh believes that it will follow him to
Washir.etor. by the mail due in 1 week
or so. In that event it will, of course, be
at once forwarded to the relatives.

SCHOOL BOARD GETS
SUPPORT OF TEACHERS
An Appeal to Supervisors for
a Larger Appropriation.
Great Mass Meeting of Members of the
Department Held at the Mission
High School,
THE school teachers of San Francisco, |
in mass-meeting assembled, have j
united their voices In an appeal to !
the Supervisors to make a tax levy ;
' sufficient to apportion the sum of JI.2CQ.- !
t OJO for the maintenance of the public ',
|* schools of the city for the current fiscal ]
year. Supervisor Holland was an. inter-'
est-! listener.
The main auditorium of Mission High i
School was crowded yesterday afternoon I
j with, teachers, who had taken advantage
; of the half holiday to raise their voices |
; In protest against the school appropria
tion of JI,I2S,CvJ recommended by Mayor
Phelan and to frame an appeal to the j
Supervisors to increase It. They lost no
i time in getting down to business.
In calling the meeting to ' - lex A. I* j
j Mar.' principal of the Desman Grammar j
i School, said he was glad the teachers had
5 met in such numbers to support the i
I Board of Education in its petition for an :
! additional appropriation. He said It had
I been reported in some of the papers that
| the teachers were under the lash and he
| wanted to refute that statement. He
counseled wise action.
Principal Elisha Brooks of the Girls' \

President Bergerot of the Board of Ed
ucation then made a short address:
"I want to state the posit of the
beard. This is the first time in a genera
tion that the Board of Education without
any fault of its own finds itself confront
! Ed" by a serious situation that may end
In a crisis. If the appropriation ls re ~
! duced now "the reduction may be > made
! permanent under the new charter.
Ha'- â¢ - said that the Mayor had rec
ommended to the Supervisors c. school
i appropriation of J1.125.0-0. Mr. Berg
i announced that Director Ho.: t and
i himself had had a conference with his
Honor, who was soon convinced tnat that
| appropriation was too small for tie proper
j conduct of the department. Â'"
In support of the statement that Mayor-
Phelan had changed his views the foilow-
I ing letter from him was read:
San Francisco. Sept. 15. ISS9.
To the Teacners" Meeting Called by
the Board of Educationâ Ladies and
Gentlemen: I have not been invited j
to be present at your meeting tms ;
afternoon, although I am In receipt of
the same circular letter which was
tent to you from thÂ« secretary's of
fice of the Board of Education. I as
sume that in sending me the -....- ;
letter the president of the Board of
Education, Mr. Bergerot, .simply de-.
sired that I should be apprised of the j
meeting and its object in order that I
I might communicate with you til |
wished. Ido desire that the teachers" i
understand the situation and hence |
this communication.
The Board of Supervisors are
charged by law with the duty of fix
ing the tax levy on the third Monday
of September. The Mayor has no
voice or veto in the premises.
The Board of Supervisors are
pledged to levy a tax of not more than
$1 on each' sl^o. based upon a valua
tion of the city's assessable property
of J350.C00.W0.
I was asked by the board to advise
them and submitted at their request
an estimate. How far they will follow
my advice I cannot tell until Monday.
My aim in submitting the estimate
was to help them to observe their
pledge, as I myself had also taken the
pledge. _ .
If they abolish sinecures as I have
recommended and cut off needless ex- i
penditures the city government can be
safely conducted for Jo.OOOM.v and their
pledges be kept.
The School Department wants for
operating expenses $1,200,000. Believ
:.. fe tnat with the careful co-operation
oi the Board oi fcxrac&iion ana tne
abandonment of the plans for Dew
buildings, to be paid out of the tax
levy the department could be con
ducted for Jl "--â¢ â â¢ which was $24,000
more than the amount mated by
the Merchants' Association, I recom- :
mended that amount. Since then I
have satisfied myself that the depart
ment should receive $71,000 more and
go Informed the Board of Supervisors
at its meeting on August 2S, and I will
repeat the recommendation on Mon- ;
day.
The only way by which this can be '
done within the pledge is to take the
money from some other department
or departments or put the election
expanses outside the pledge on the
ground that the primary election and ;
the municipal election to be held In
November were imposed upon the city
by the Legislature, which met and
acted subsequently to the taking of
the pledge. In every other previous
platform imposing the dollar limit of - -I
taxation and in the new charter the |
expenses for maintaining the parks .
and squares are excepted. Whether j
the omission last year was accidental
or by design I have no means of as
certaining.
As to new school buildings. I believe
that such permanent improvements
should be paid for out of the proceeds
of a bond Issue, and will recommend
the Election Commissioners to call an
election In the middle of December, at
which the people will decide whether
they shall Issue bonds, repayable in
forty years, for the construction of
schools, hospital, sewers and park im
provements, each to be voted on sepa
rately. . - V
As to the teachers back salaries for
November and December, lost to then
by the mismanagement of the school
funds. I desire to say that I co-oper
ated with the teachers* committee in
having a constitutional amendment
passed by the last Legislature pro
viding for their payment, with 5 per
cent per annum added, the question .to
be submitted to the pc pie at the gen
eral election In November. ISOO, and I
will be pleased to strongly advocate
the adoption of the . constitutional
amendment, and because it is just I
am satisfied that it will prevail. Once
adopted the teachers will be paid and
the city will discharge its debt to
them. Under the provisions of the
new charter .which goes into effect
next year, there will be no question in
the future as to the regular monthly
payment of the teachers' salaries, as
the charter on this subject was drafted
with a view of accomplishing this very
i purpose by protecting all municipal
employes and at the same time the
honor and re lit of the city.
Very respectfully,
JAMES D. PHELAN. Mayor.
Some applause followed this manifesta
tion of the Mayor's change of heart, at
the conclusion of which a preamble and
resolutions voicing the sentiment of the
teachers in the department with regard
to the tax levy was read by the secretary
at follows:
Whereas. It is proposed to make a
tax levy for the support of the public
schools in the city ana county or Sao
Francisco for the ensuing fiscal year
suiftcient to raise therefi . :.. only the
sum "Â£..-â¢ B and
Whereas, sucn sum is, In our judg
ment, wildly insufficient for the neecs.
of the department; and
Whereas, In view of the loss of two
montns" salary by the teachers of this
department in November and Decem
ber, IaSB, no part of which has been
paid.tne InSicuon of any lurtner io'ss
during the present riscai year, either
by reduction or non-payment of sal
aries, is an act of injustice of which no
branch of tne municipal government
should be willing to tolerate; there
fore, be it
Kesolved, By the teachers of the
public schools of San Francisco, in
mass-meeting' assemDitd, that accord
ing to our oesi information and be
lief it will . --at least i. _.â  â¢.â  .
economically spent, to properly con
duct the educational department of
said city and county for the resent
fiscal year.
Resolved, That the collection of any
less sum of money would cripple the
department ar.d force the teachers,
.â â â â "- and other employes of the de
partment to perform services without
receiving any compensation therefor,
and would seriousiy endanger the pay
ment of the cemands of the merchants
of the city i.or necessary supplies to
- be : ... the department; tie it
furthea
Resolved, That the Board of Super
visors of the city and county of San
Francisco is hereby requested to make
a levy sufiicient to raise the sum or
JI.SwXO for the maintenance of the
puolic schools; and be it further
Resolved. That we appeal to the Mer
chants' Association of San Francisco
and all other municipal associations,
to the press and to the public gen
erally to give their approval to such
an appropriation as will be necessary
to relieve the present embarrassment-
Madison Babcock suggested that In
order that the action ta^en by the meet
ing- might be laid properly before the
. Supervisors, a committee made up of one
teacher from each school be selected, to
; name in turn a visiting committee to
: wait upon" the Supervisors and urge their
: favor. W. D. Kmgsbury. vice principal
lof Horace Mann School, moved an
> amendment that ar* committee includ-
I ing the chair, be appointed for that pur
[ pose by the chair. After some discussion
! the amendment carried, and the chair se
. lected to act with himself W. D. Kings
j bury, vice principal of the Horace Mann
j Grammar; Miss Â£.. E. Stincen, principai
i of Whittier Primary; Jose] O'Connor,
' principal of Mission High School; Frank
Morton, Business Evening School, and C.
H. Murphy of the Polytechnic High
School.
On motion of Principal Mann, the
thanks of the meeting were tendered to
the Board of Education for Its kindness
in giving the teachers the opportunity to
get together and express themselves on
a subject in which they were so deeply
concerned.
On motion of Mrs. Prag thanks were
also extended to Auditor Asa R. Wells
for the stand he has taken in regard to
the segregation of teachers' salaries. The
meeting then adjourned and the commit
tee on Supervisors went into session,
where it was decided to visit personally
each Supervisor and enlist his aid in be
half of the necessary appropriation. It
was concluded that the time was too short
to circulate petitions for signature, as had
been suggested, and that ideiwas aban
doned.

So there is nothing new under the sun in the situ
ation. War inevitably presents these opportunities,
and very often those who make the most frenzied
appeals to patriotism in behalf of war are the most
cold-hearted, selfish and corrupt in their motives.
The charges published in Denver should not be
passed silently, nor should their investigation be per
functory and with a purpose of stopping short of the
truth while pretending to have sought it.
We are anxious that the conditions alleged shall
be taken to heart by the people in making up their
judgment upon the undertaking of a mixed military
and civil administration at such a distance. It has
never been honestly and ratisfactorily done under a
Government approximating ours in form, and if we
are to do it honorably and with clean hands con
stant guard must be kept.
THE SPOILS OF THE TRANSVAAL.
OUT of the London "Stock Exchange Year
Book" the New York Sun has compiled the
statistics showing the dividends of the gold
mines in the Transvaal for 1898, and very justly draws
from them the conclusion that what the British are
-..king in the country of the Boers is not freedom,
franchise and equal rights, but gold. The list is suffi
ciently interesting to be given in full. As present-'d
by the Sim it. stands thus:

Gold mines that pay dividends like that are sure
to excite cupidity, and the British owners of them are
not lacking in greed. While they are extracting
such enormous profits from the mines they are un
willing to pay the taxes the Boers levy upon them,
and denounce almost every tax as an imposition and
a burden. They would willingly have a war. for the
cost of it would have to be paid by the British tax
r, while the mine-owners would reap all the
benefit.
Sir Alfred Milner, just before leaving England for
South Africa, is reported to have said in answer to
a 'juestion concerning the policy he would adopt: "If
you saw a solid pile of gold worth five hundred mil
lions sterling over there with 20,000 Boers armed to

THE SA!N FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 16. 1899.
A CONSUMPTION QUARANTINE
i S~^ ALIFORXIA is beginning to suffer as all locali
i ( ties do which can boast a prophylactic climate.
; Such a climate invites physical deterioration by
the sj^ead of diseases for which its curative ministry
is sought.
The unchecked march of consumption has attracted
j the attention and*roused the alarm of people outside
the medical profession in all the civilized world. Like
cancer and scrofula, it is one of the diseases of civili
zation. The various plagues, black and bubonic, the
cholera and leprosy, were the pests of the ancient
world, and still hold their place among the semi
civilized races. It is probable, however, that, con
sidering the sporadic nature of the two plagues and
! of cholera, consumption, being endemic in the civil
ized countries, destroys five times as many people as
they do.
Science having demonstrated that consumption is
infectious, the world has been led to seriously con
sider ways and means to prevent its spread. Among
these are the isolation of patients, disinfection of the
sputum and excretions, and exclusion of sufferers'
from localities where they mingle with sound people,
: endangering their infection.
Heretofore the interests of "the individual patient,
regarded from a humane standpoint, have risen
above the welfare of the masses. The in-
Milious nature of the disease, the fact that its
victim is for a time left qualified for the
active duties of life and usually pursues them, have
lifted the disease out of the catalogue in which small
pox, cholera and the acute diseases are classified.
Teachers smitten with consumption continue in their
vocation, as do members of other professions and per
j sons engaged in active business. In families one
unfortunate member, sentenced to death by this re
sistless destroyer, continues in the close and affec
tionate relations of the domestic circle, with the cer
tainty of transmitting the malady to those the near
est and dearest. For all these reasons the extirpa-
I tion of consumption is a task of appalling magnitude
I and difficulty. This State, with its equable climate, in
, which the acute diseases of the respiratory organs
occurred infrequently, seemed to offer no conditions
in which consumption could originate. The steady
hire of sunshine and scenery to outdoor life and the j
singular purity of the air were wholesome guarantees
of sound lungs and vigorous vitality. But these con
ditions, unfriendly to the origin of the disease, were
quickly recognized as friendly to its cure or to the
arrest and mitigation of its progress. The result has
been that California has come to be sought by con
sumptive patients from all over the country. As a
rule they arrive with the malady so far advanced as
to foreclose on all hope of cure. Therefore they
come at a time most favorable for the infection of all
with whom they come in contact. The dreadful
sputum, ejected on the sidewalks and in the streets,
reduced to tine particles, is blown into the air, where
it iioats and is inhaled with the motes that fleck the
sunbeams, coming into immediate contact with the
respiratory system and planting there the germs of
dissi ilution.
The result is the spread of consumption here, where
ii should be rare or unknown. It causes more
deaths than any other disease, and more than all the
zymotic fevers combined. Its arrest has become an
of prime importance in the sanitation of the
State.
The State Board of Health proposes to begin with
a rigid quarantine at the State line, turning hack all
infected persons who seek to enter the State for cli
matic cure of the disease. There will surely arise out
of this questions concerning the lawful right to ex
clude su â  Â»ns. There may be a lack of legisla
tion on the subject and a deficiency of authority in the
vhich will limit the courts when they pass upon
issues that may be joined.
There is no question, however, that such a policy
entered upon by the hoard will bring the whole mat
ter vividiy before the world and lead to measures of
vast benefit to the uninfected and of equal value to
sufferers. We believe it would be the first attempt
made in the world, outside of New Zealand, to quar
antine consumption and deny freedom of transit and
association to its victims. Great results would no
doubt follow. The public mind needs no education
in the need of isolation in smallpox and cholera.
But it is unprepared to tolerate the same rigor of
treatment in consumption. Yet if smallpox in" one
year destroyed as many lives as consumption does, in
any part of the State pr of the Union, there would be
a panic that would paralyze the business of the na
tion.
Yellow fever invades our Gulf Coast and the South
Atlantic seaboard infrequently, and only at certain
seasons of tbe year, but instantly State quarantines
against State and city against city, and the refugees
crowd the roads in flight from the pestilence. At the
same time in thoseÂ«same localities consumption kills
many fold more steadily year by year than yellow
fever.
A State quarantine against consumption is only one
of many means that must be taken to eradicate it.
The infected must be rigidly isolated and attended
only in the exercise of exceeding precautions. Tht
expulsion of their sputum unsterilized must be pro
vided against, and every one must be treated thor
oughly as a center of infection that must be avoided
by all means known to sanitary science.
If California lead in all this and can show a success
measured in a decline in the ravages of the disease,
we will have pioneered in that which is of the firit
interest and highest importance to the human rare.
Counsel Moss of the Mazet Committee may be the
right man after all to detect the thieveries of New
York officials. A decision of the Supreme Court of
the Empire State has just been dug up in which the
opinion is expressed that several notaries, Moss
among them, should be criminally prosecuted.
THE EXHIBITION OF EXPORTS.
PHILADELPHIA has accomplished one more
of those enterprises by which she refutes the
reputation of sleepiness which New York and
Chicago have attempted to fasten upon her. In fact,
it appears that so far from being a sign of sleep, the
silence which prevails in Philadelphia is due to the
fact that her people are too busily at work to be
boasting of progress. Thus it happens that at this
juncture, when tj/e expansion of our export trade in
manufactured goods is the most salient feature of the
commerce of the world, Philadelphia takes the lead
of American cities in the establishment of a commer
cial museum and the opening of an exhibition of ex
ports. The much-boasting men of enterprise in New
York and Chicago must go to Philadelphia to learn
from the museum what goods are in demand in for
eign countries, and must send their own goods to the
exposition there to show what they have to sell.
The rapid increase in our exports of manufactures
Tias been one of the marvels of the time. In 1800, ac
cording to statistics recently published by the Treas
ury Department, we imported manufactured articles
of a value twice as great as that of the manufactured
articles exported, the figures being: Value of imports
of manufactures, $356,651,940; value of exports of
; manufactures, $151,102,376. This continued until 1894,
! when the values began to approximate, imports grow
ing smaller and exports larger in value. In 1898 for
the first time the value of manufactures exported ex
ceeded the value of manufactures imported, and in
1899 there was a marked difference, the value of manu
| factures imported being $263,248,559, while the value
of manufactures exported was $338,667,794.
With this increase in the amount of exports of
manufactured goods, while the exports of raw ma
terial and foodstuffs also increase, there has come a
demand for an increase of shipping to carry the rapidly
growing trade. Naturally enough that need was
made the theme of the principal addresses at the open
ing of the exposition* In the address of welcome
Governor Stone said: "We are now fairly in the
race for the world's trade. Our only drawback is
shipping facilities. To-day our exports are carried
in foreign ships and we are paying $180,000,000 each
year to foreign ship-owners. This is a reflection on
our statesmanship. Our ocean freight should be car
ried in American ships. If the circumstances do not
justify the construction of American ships in Ameri
can docks, Congress should by subsidy or otherwise
make it an inducement to capital to embark on this
enterprise."
Congressman Hepburn, who delivered the oration
of the day, emphasized the same point in saying:
"There are nineteen millions of people in the United
States who labor and who aid in creating wealth.
Fifteen millions of these possess the entire political
power of the nation. The perpetuity of this Govern
ment is dependent upon keeping this great army of
laborers employed, and, being employed, content. It
can only be secured by securing our portion of the
trade in the markets of the world, and in efforts to
secure it we must meet and overcome the fiercest
rivalry of the great nations."
Such are the sentiments excited by the great expo
sition of American export products with which Phila
delphia is now entertaining the East. The influence
will be felt when Congress meets, and it is likely we
shall at last have an act which will give to the Ameri
can merchant marine an equal chance with the
foreigner.
The Minneapolis Times evidently knows a good
thing when it sees it. In an issue just at hand giving
account of the arrival at this port of the transport
Sheridan with the Minnesota boys from the Philip
pines it has taken bodily the frontispiece of The Call's
souvenir edition announcing the homecoming of the
Californians, scraped off the name "Sherman" on the
bow of the vessel and substituted "Sheridan." It
failed, however, to give The Call credit for the
original.
THE TRUST CONFERENCE AT CHICAGO
rROM the debates thus far reported at the con
ference on trusts called by the Civic Federation
of Chicago very little has resulted, of apparent
value to the public There has been but a thrashing
over of the old straw, p.nd neither those who have
spoken against trusts nor those who have spoken in
their favor have advanced any argument with which
the public is not fairly familiar, nor brought forward
any facts not previously known.
It is to be hoped that when these preliminary
speeches arc over and all the gifted orators have
given full utterance to their ideas on the subject, the
more deliberative members of the conference will re
vise all that has been said and formulate somethinK
like a definite conclusion on the subject. There is not
so much difference between the moderate men of tin
opposing sides as the radicals would like to have the
country believe. It is conceded by the opposition
that trusts have a large economic value and are there
fore useful to the community of whose industrial
conditions they are the natural outgrowth, and by the
advocates of trusts it is admitted they are liable to
generate abuses and ought to be regulated by law.
In his address before the American Bar Associa
tion .1 few weeks ago Senator Manderson summed
tip the subject in saying: "The problems, legal and
political, that are the most absorbingly important and
likely to lead to far-reaching results in law-making
and statute construction are those incident to so
called trust?, pools and combinations in manufacture,
commerce and trade. TJie legislative difficulty seems
to be to draw the line that should divide the\ objec
tionable trust, or monop6ly that defies the natural
laws of trade from the desirable corporation or the
concentration of capital, productive of good result.?.
To strike down the one and not cripple the other is
no easy task for the law-maker. Concentration is the
order of the day. Industries of importance and en
terprises of magnitude can only be carried on with
success by bringing together that aggregation of cap
ital and limitation of personable liability permissible in
the creation called a corporation. The century how
closing has been during its hundred years an advance
on all lines of production, with corresponding benefit
to the customer, such as has been afforded at no
other period in the world's history."
That is about as comprehensive a statement of the
problem as can be made with an equal terseness. The
task before law-makers is that of devising legislation
which will prevent the evils of trusts without crip
pling their efficiency in the development of commerce
and industry. That a considerable number of politi
cians should denounce all trusts is a matter of course.
"Down with the trusts"' is a good demagogue cry and
is easily uttered. Fortunately it is not likely to have
much influence with the great masses of the people.
The trust has come to stay. The foundation of the in
dustrial development of the future is going to be co
operation in one form or another. Intelligent men
in all branches of industry are already forming such
combinations. We hear of them among farmers and
fruit-growers as well as among merchants and manu
facturers. The issue clearly is one not of suppression
but of regulation, and the solution of its problems
must be left to men of sound business sense and not
to noisy deciaimers from the stump.
An interior contemporary tells us in large black
type that "Dewey has left Gibraltar." It would per
haps be advisable to send a dispatch boat to meet the
admiral and ascertain why he left it. We might
need it.

CANNONADING THE CLOUDS
TO BREAK UP HAILSTORMS
THIS picture might lie taken as an illustration of how mortals rail through phonographs upon Jupiter Pluvius. At that
tli>' Interpretation would not he so far out of the way. for really these people are trying to induce the clouds to quit
balling mid send down their message in form of rain. Some time ago the newspapers described an experiment in Italy
of cannonading the clou. ls to get rid of hailstorms, and this shows how the operation was conducted at an agricul
tural exposition ;it Monza, a small town ten miles from Milan.
Mortars are fired, with the result of a loud concussion and a good deal of smoke. The funnels direct the sound wave 3
in tremendous volume toward the clouds, and presumably force the currents of cold air up higher and dissipate the
clouds which bear hail. Sometimes these clouds are driven away, and sometimes it is the cold air which vanishes, leaving
in its place warm air. which causes the hail to turn Into rain. It is said, too, that the smoke has something to do with the
result, !>â¢ rhaps by chemical action upon the clouds.

before he can leave his room. His right
eye was nearly gouged out. his scalp is
badly torn, his wrist Is sprained and his
body Is black and blue and covered with
scars.
MillÂ© was uptown and spent the even

after his companion when one of the gang
struck him with a slungshot. Mille re

must have jumped on him and nearly
kicked him to death.
A few hour? later one of the crew came
along and with the assistance of the
watenman got the unfortunate fellow
aboard the ship. As soon as he is able to
leave the ship Mille will report the mat

fog was "thick enough to cut," and he
never caught sight of what he was after.
He spoke several steam schooners and
the ship Invincible and bark Merom, but
none of them had seen or heard of the
raft. He steamed all over the place where
the Czarina and her tow were spoken by
the North Fork, but could find no trace
of either. He thinks they have gone off
phore to get out of the track of incoming
vessels and will remain hove to until the
fog lifts.

OLD AGE AND GUILELESS YOUTH
WENT OUT ON DEATH'S EBB TIDE
OLD age and guileless youth went out
on death's ebb tide yesterday.
Two lives were those of old men,
â¢worn out in the race, sick, hopeless
as to what might yet come to them in this
world and reckless as to the next. So
with more or less unreason they chose the
way of the suicide and unsummoned drift
ed into the unknown. The third was an
innocent babe, who unwittingly took poi
son and was forced to pay the penalty.
The younger of the old men was ex-
Policeman Frederick J. Smith. He had
passed three score years and four. He
had been a trusted official of the Police
Department for many years and was
placed on the pension list at the begin
ning of the present year. For the last
fifteen months he had been suffering with
what he thought was an incurable disease
and had a physician at stated intervals
to prescribe for and treat him at the fam
ily residence. 1313 Devisadero street.
As the ravages of the disease Increased
Mr. Smith's despondency grew more
marked, and his family say that at times
he became "out of his mind."
Shortly before 9 o'clock yesterday morn
ing Mr." SmHh went to his room, osten
sibly for the purpose of changing his
clothing. A moment later the report of a
revolver was heard, succeeded by the
sound of a heavy body falling to the floor.
His horrified wife ran to the room and
found her husband lying in a pool of
blood In front of the bureau, with the
smoking revolver clutched in his right
hand and a bultet wound in the right
temple.
The circumstance that the suicide left
no note or scrap of writing revealing his

MEXICO'S INDEPENDENCE
FITTINGLY COMMEMORATED
THE Club Patriotico Hidalgo commemorated the independence of Mexico
last evening with literary and musical exercises. Washington-square Hall,
in which the celebration was held, was crowded with members and
friends of the organization. The hall was prettily decorated with the
Mexican colors interwoven with the stars and stripes.
The programme opened with an overture by the orchestra. G. D. Kotta. sec
retary of the club, then read the act of Mexican independence, which was loudly
applauded. This was followed by the "Exposition March." executed on the piano
by Professor F. J. Fernandez. Senor R. Serrano then delivered the official dis-
Promptly at 11 o'clock the sound of a bell filled the hall. This was the signal
for wild cheering, for it was at that hour in the night that the first stroke for
Mexico's independence was struck by the brave priest, Miguel Hidalgo. Dr. D. F.
Martinez, the honorary president of the club, delivered a short oration, in which
he described the efforts of the brave patriots to secure liberty in their country;
told of their hardships and struggles, and of the success that at last came to
them His remarks evoked loud applause. At the conclusion of the address the
orchestra struck up the Mexican national hymn. The following programme was
KTeatly enjoyed by those present:

purpose of self-destruction adds strength
to the theory of temporary insanity. Mr.
Smith worried a good deal over the es
cape of a prisoner named Bennett, who
got away from him over a year ago and
was arrested subsequently on the north
ern coast. Bennett resided on McAllister
street, near the Hibernia Bank, and
stabbed his wife and himself. He was
arrested Immediately after the stabbing
and taken to the City Receiving Hospital
for treatment. At that time policeman
Smith, being unable to do patrol duty,
was in charge of the hospital, and the
prisoner managed to escape through a
window while the policeman's back was
turned. The Police Commissioners fined
Smith $100 for carelessness and he fretted
very much over the affair? not because of
the fine but because of the reprimand it
carried with It.

In the home for the last six years, and for
the past few months had been sickly and
despondent. At half-past 7 o'clock yester
day morning he failed to answer the sum
mons to breakfast, and when the door of
his room was forced open he was found
hanging to the knob, one end of a red
bandana handkerchief being tied around
his neck and the other end to the door

ing a bundle of matches that he had
picked up around the house.
As soon as the child began to experience
tho effects of the phosphorus a physician
was called in and worked upon the suf
ferer until 3 o'clock In the morning, but
the deadly chemical had obtained too
great a start and the little patient died.
No one Is to blame for the distressing:
accident, the parents not having been
aware that any matches were lying

the child.
An Inquest will be held this morning.
DODGE MAKES A PLEA
FOR MORE CITY CASH
NEEDS MORE DEPUTIES TO DO
WORK REQUIRED.
Assessment of Real Estate and Im
provements Should Be Revised
Throughout the City.
Assessor Washington Dodge hnz offered
up to the Board of Supervisors another
plea for more "stuff." He handed It into
j the Clerk's office yesterday disguised as a
supplement to his regular report. In it
Assessor Dodge dwells feelingly upon the
difficulty of properly doing the duties of
his office with a limited account at the
Treasurer's desk; he also cites figures to
show that he has beaten everything else
In the Assessor line since any one ever
fought at the polls for the job. This is
I what Assessor Dodge said he was going
I to do before election; he did not say,
I however, that ho would require an extra
clerical force to do it. Concerning nia
office and his method of operating it and
the results he has accomplished, Mr.
Dodge has to say in his report:
The total assessment roll for the
year 1899, after making the corrections
and deductions authorized by your
honorable body, -amounts to $4u5,11i,615,
as against $352,344,061 for the year 1896,
or an Increase of $[>2,767,554 over the
assessment of last year. As the toial
assessment of real estate is $344,7;>4
less this year than the assessment of
real estate for the year 1898, It fol
lows that the marked increase in the
assessment roll has been obtained
through the Increased assessment oÂ£
personal property.
An analysis of this Increase of $52,
--767,554 shows it to have been made la
the following manner:
Increase.
Quasi public corporations J19.507.fcEd
Bonds 19,, r )07,.559
Shipping (new) 497456
Chinese assessment 497,155
Estimate In probate 6,767,127
Insurance companies 585,350
Merchandise (wholesale) 4.829,261
Total increase $52,767,554
To discover and properly assess all
of this additional property has been
no easy task, and has entailed on this
department during the past year a
large amount of additional work. The
appropriation made for the past year
by your honorable body was found
sufficient only by greatly increasing
the usual hours of labor that are cus
tomary for city employes. For many
months during the past year a large
part of the force of this office has
been compelled to work from 8 a. m.
to 9 and 10 p. m.
In addition to this work, which
must be again performed during the
ensuing year, there is a crying need
In this department for a still further
revision of the assessment roll in other
directions. It is now many years since
a thorough revision of the assessed
valuation of real estate, with the im
provements thereon, has been attempt
ed in this city. The result is that
many old dwellings are assessed to
day for fully as much as they were
fifteen and twenty years ago, when
i first erected. This is an injustice to
this class of taxpayers.
To thoroughly revise the assess
ment of real estate and improvements
will require the services of at least ten
deputies for the balance of ihe. fiscal
year, in addition to the usual clerical
force of the office. The services of at
least three additional deputies are de
manded to act as experts in ferreting
, out and properly assessing those forms
of personal property which so readily
and regularly escape taxation.
Notwithstanding these facts, it has
been proposed by your honorable body
to reduce the appropriation of last year
by $35,000.
Then Mr. Dodge goes on with the argu
ments he has made use of upon numerous
previous occasions when he has attempted
to have his apportionment increased. His
plea will be considered on Monday, when
the Supervisors linally llx the tax levy.
Czarina Did Not Find the Baft.
The Czarina arrived last night in port
without the raft which was lost over a
week ago. The report Riven out by the
steamer North Fork, which arrived on
Thursday, that the raft had been recov
ered moved to have been a mistake. Cap
tain Seaman of the Czarina cruised about
for four days, but the fog was so thick
that he was unable to see but a short dis
tance. The Ferris S. Thompson spoke the
searching vessel on Wednesday and re
ported that the raft was but a few miles
from where both ships lay, but investiga
tion proved the obstruction to be but a
few Btray logs and none of the missing
raft.

CHEAP BUNKO
MAN FROM THE
LAND OF GOLD
Made a Big Play for a
Little Gain.
NEW KIND OF GOLD BRICK
TEACHER FOR CIRCLE CITY WHO
MUST NOT WED.
Offered $200 Per Month for Instruc
tor â Told of All Kinds of Money
and Borrowed Seventy-
Five Cents.
A. H. MacDor.ald, principal of the Lin
coln Evening School, as well as his very
efficient stafr of teachers, is anxious to
know the whereabouts of one Strauss
from Alaska, a self-reputed millionaire.
Strauss went to Mac Donald recently to
secure his advice and assistance in pro
curing a teacher for Circle City, in the
far north, at a modest salary of $200 per
month, with all expenses paid. The man
from the Klondike was willing to abide
by the Instructor's selection, demanding
one concession from the teacher Mac-
Donald might choose.
The young woman who was to train the
budding minds in the new land of gold
was to sign a contract to the effect that
she would teach school for one year and
during that time would consider no pro
posals of marriage. The day after Strauss
enlisted the principal's interest in the ed
ucational affairs of Circle City he called
upon Mr. Mac Donald in the Southern Pa
cinc building. This time he sought the
instructor's advice as to the safe-keeping
of the vast wealth he had amassed in
Alaska, incidentally borrowed $1 and then
disappeared with never a backward
thought to the poor Alaskan children so
anxiously awaiting a teacher.
In the anr.als of bunko life and gold
brick transactions Mr. Strauss has made
an innovation. He has introduced a new
game. It partakes of the nature of a
"sure thing" and possesses but one draw
backâa small gain as the result of elab
orate detail. The amusing part of
Strauss' game is the fact that the vic
tim ignores the fact that he has been
"playtd."
"I can't understand It," says the vete
ran teacher, losing sight of the petty re
sult in wonderment at the magniurence
of the scheme. Â» "It was this way. Sev
eral nights ago I was seated in my office
at the Lincoln Evening School when a
stranger walked into my room and with
out any explanatory phrasing demanded
that I assist him in selecting a tea.ch.er
for Circle City.
" 'We want a teachcrbad up there,' he
said. "The boys have got together and
determined that whatever the cost we
should have one, and they have deputed
me to see that they get the proper per
son.'
"I then asked him why he came to me "
continued Mr. Mac Donald, "and he said
that one Al White, a graduate of my
school, had advised him to consult me in
the matter. We talked it over and came
to the conclusion that the salary should
be $200 per month, with all expenses paid,
and that I should let him meet after
school hours my teachers and he could
place the matter before them. 'There is
but one thing I insist upon,' he said; 'the
lady selected must be a young woman of
determined character; one that cannot
be tempted from the path of honor and
duty, and furthermore, she must sign a
contract to teach for one year, during
which time she must not marry.'
"My teachers met Mr. Strauss that
same evening," remarked the principal.
"Two ladies seemed rather inclined to ac
cept his offer. To one he said she was
too young and that the Klondikers would
never let her live a year in single blessed- i
ness, and the other he declared was too i
frail. Finally he said he would leave the
matter to me and would call in a few
clays. He came the next day to see me
at the treasurer's office of the Southern
Pacific Company and said he wanted my
advice as to how he might place his
money. 'I've heard good reports from
the Hibernia Bank,' he said, 'but they
will accept no greater deposit than $10,000
and that never would do me.' So," ex
plained Mr. Mac Donald, "I recommended
a big commercial bank and we arranged
to go there on Monday. Then he told me
that he had Just telegraphed a ticket to
his parents in Germany to bring them to
this coast and was much annoyed to
think he was just 75 cents short. He
asked me if I could oblige him and save
him the trouble of going home and I
gave him a dollar. And that," concluded
Mr. Mac Donald, "is the last I saw of
Mr. Strauss, millionaire of Circle City." I
It is thought that "Strauss" sought the !
advice of other trusting gentlefolks, and I
among the number is mentioned Captain I
Denby, who has two sons wooing fortune
in Alaska.

))r:ir:- now a( the great unirersfttes is

: !hi ri an more to follow.

That this season will be the greatest
known to the- ? Pacific Coast ' - an abso
lute certainty. The reason of it lies in the
defeat of the "Cardinal" a year ago. The
interest in the. gridiron sport Is on the
Increase, and with the Olympics repre
sented by a strong, 'enthusiastic team the
three big elevens of California should fur
nish a series of games that will send
shafts of delight through thÂ»' football
hefirt - . â*â
The interest throughout the season will
cer.ter largely In the Palo Alto team, for
that eleven will be onÂ« of development,
just as California's was last season. If
rumor breathes a syllable of truth Cham
lierlin will soon have the assistance of
two of the best football men in America.
It is given out on good authority that
Grcnwrnul, the great end who played on
Yale's team when Hincklcy captained it.
â¢will soon shout football truths into the
ears of the Pal Alto athletes. This is
not all. The greatest of all the great,
Walter Camp, has written to some of his
friends declaring his intention of spend
ing the fall in California. That on its
face means that the great football author
ity will be at Palo Alto, should he come
to* California at all. i â¢ wood, Cham
berlin and Gamp make a triumvirate
equal to the best that any Eastern col
lege can boast.
Cochran will not be alone In hi? coach
ing labors. "King" Kelly, another Prince
tonian, and one of the best backs that
university has produced, will be with the
California team In two weeks. It will be
Princeton against Yale on the California
soil as much as it is Berkeley against
Stanford. Chamberlin played on the
same team that defeated the Princeton
eleven, which Cochran captained. There
will be two distinct battles In this year's
intercollegiate game.
An interesting story, not yet published,
was told at Berkeley a few days ago. It
â¢was in relation to the methods pursued
by the Berkeley managers in order to se
cure the services of Cochran. Cochran
was engrossed in the management of a
nine at Silver City, N. M.. when the Cali
fornia men arrived. They stated their
terms and he told them that they were
certainly foolish in offering him so much
money for a short season and that many
better men than himself could be brought
out to California at half the expense.
There was a disagreement on the part of (
the managers as to this point and as
they were determined to have Cochran
the" Ltter'B life was made miserable for
a week by the Berkeley commissioners.
Cochran admits that it was too much for. |
him and at the end of the week, fearing
nervous prostration, he signed the con- |
tract which will give him $2000 for eleven j
weeks' work. The figure set was the
original offer on the part of the Berkeley
managers. Even then the California men
began to feel a chill in their nether ex- !
tremities and this week they kept wiring
all over New Mexico for the Princeton !
coach. He was located on the train that
brought i..m to this city.
The situation this year Is practically
the fame as last, with a reversion of the
names of Stanford and California. Tne
latter college has Its entire team back
with the exception of Thane, the quarter
back, and Craig, an end, but there are a
great number of men who will be able to
fill thoee positions. The team is out
daily for preliminary work, though they
have not begun actual training as yet.
Cochran said yesterday that he would
not force the men into a rigid training
until after the first Olympic game, which
will be played on the 30th inst. Cochran
thinks I Is work will be more difficult this
year than it was last for two reasons â
the great efforts that Stanford will
make to regain former prestige and the
havoc wrought in the minds of the Cali
fornia team by the victory of '98. Coch
ran Is wasting no time and will have the
men playing before the c"nd of next week,
though the work will be of the lightest.
At Stanford Captain Murphy and Coach
Chamberlin are making the most of their
opportunities. The interest of the college
men in the gridiron game is of a better
sort than It was a year ago and the spirit
of the college is back of ft. Early in the
week the backs came out followed by the
linesmen a few days later. Nothing but
preliminary work has been done so far. '
Coach Chamberlin has been sorting ma
terial and keeping vigil for the beat of- \
fered.
The Olympics have begun their practice !
In the Armory and they are at it with a I
â will this time. The names of all the men I
playing with the Olympics under me
Olympic standard this year have been,
published. The team Is not yet made up
but soon will be. When the clubmen line
up against the Callfornlans for the first
game of the season there should be the i
feeling of victory in their veins, for they
have the ripened material of many sea- i
sons in their team.
ON THE CRICKET PITCH.
The return cricket match, married ver
eus single players, which was scheduled
for to-morrow on the card of the Califor
nia Cricket Association will not take
place. Several of the benedicts are un
able to play or have other engagements,
so that it pro\ed impossible to get to
gether a team fairly representing them.
There now remain three matches and
three open dates upon the schedule. I'pon
one of the latter the California team will
visit Santa Cruz to play against the
eleven' of the Country Club, which recent
ly visited this city and scored a victory
against both the Alameda and Pacific
dubs, defeating the former by tweniy-
Beven and the latter by fifty runs. The
visiting team, though playing under the
name of the Santa Cruz Country Club, in
cluded A. <>. Sheath, wrho resides in 'this
city and was formerly connected with the
Bohemian Cricket Club, and D. D. Bow
ley and H. M. C. Fleming, who are both
n Jose. In the match against the
Pacifies Sheath took live wickets and
Bowley captured four, and in the game
against the Alamedas Bowley took six
wickets for eleven runs, and contributed
thiiiy-ono to the Santa Cruz total of 110
for six wickets In their second innings.
The victories of thr; visitors, however,
were largely due to their excellent lidd
ing.
A. G. Sheath and F. K. Ritchie have
Joined the California Club.

CHALLENGER
"GADDER" IS
NEARLY FIT
The Yacht Carefully Prepared
for the Perpetual Chal
lenge Cup Race.
J. TV. Pew's sloop Truant carried away her
bowsprit shrouds and bobstay and dented
her stern when she ran against the launch
Brisk, lying at MelpÃS wharf last Satur
day. She has been *^ken on the ways to
be put in order for â¢ â  race on September
23 for the perpetual challenge cup. She
will be Bailed by the ex-commodore, who
will probably have the following crew:
Charles L. Barrett, Orlo Eastwood, Com-
modore Carl West erf eld, J. Short and F.
E. Schober. The Gadder lias been greatly
changed and has received a new suit of
sails. She should reach Sausalito to
morrow. Xo crew has yet been decided
on for her, but it is considered probable
that ex-Commodore W. N. McCarthy will
act as her skipper. It is doubtful whether
the San Francisco Yacht Club can find
six men who have hnd as much experience
in handling light sails on a small boat as
the half dozen Corinthians named.
The victory of the Aeolus in the thirty
foot class at the fourth annual regatta of
the Pacific Interclub Yacht Association
showed the great importance of crossing
the line soon after the signal when to
start Is by one gun. The Amigo actually
beat the .V< h:s on the first leg to wind
ward, but having lost fifty seconds at the
start rounded the windward buoy thirty
secondaafterher. At the leeward stakeboat
she was 2 minutes 30 a condsand at Meigga
wharf Z minutes 13 seconds behind the
eotus. On the second beat out she
gained 1 minute 30 seconds and finish) d
only 2 minuti s 4'J seconds actual time
behind the winner. The mishap to the
Truant was directly attributable to late
ness at the start, i"r had she crossed the
line in her own class she would not have
been mixed up with the thiriy-six-fooiers,
which caused her early retirement.
The Presto lost on every leg of the
course, l-<â¢i ij tr 3 minutes IS seconds astern
of the Aeolus on the first beat out. 7 min
utes "4 seconds at the leeward stakel
10 minutes lo seconds at Meiggs wharf,
11 minutes 45 seconds in the s< cond beai
out and 13 minutes 57 seconds at the finish
Part of her !<?ss between the windward
and leeward stakeboata was due to the
rescue of 11. A. Hurndall, who had slipped
off the Iferope. Even if the whole loss
of the Presto up to the leeward Btakeboat
(7 minutes 24 seconds) is attributed to the
delay, no difference would be made in the
general result.
The San Franciscos have a cruise to
Mann Islands, with chowder and a clam
bake on the beach to-morrow, scheduled;
while the Corinthians have a chowder cruise
to Paradise < 'ove on their programme for
to-night, with a small yacht regatta and
rowboat races for to-morrow. These
events will be postponed on account of
the "Night in Venice" at Belvedere. The
Corinthians have set October 14 and 15 as
the dates for the chowder cruise and small
boat regatta.
The departments of patrol and anchor
age In the cove are in charge of I'ort
Captain John H. Keefe. of the Corinthian
Yacht Club. Nearly 150 yachts will be
drawn up in triple line from the moorings
of the Truant, opposite the Corinthian
Club house, to Bowers Lardiif, the
larger craft lying in the outer Hue and
the smaller ones inside. The ends of the
triple line will be strictly patrolled till
after 11 p. m. The United States cruiser
Marblehead and torpedo-boat destroyer
Farragut will be anchored outside the
yachts. No launches or boats (except
the Tlburon ferry boats) will be permitted
to land passengers at Belvedere or Tlb
uron.
The Oakland Canoe Club kept "open

Local Men Count on a Brace
of Victories, but May Be
Disappointed.
The baseball fans will have their first
good opportunity this week to fudge of the
Capabilities of the reorganized Oaklands.
Since Manager Ewing secured his new
talent the Dudes have played against no
team other than Santa Cruz, and there
is-- considerable speculation among the
fans as to what Harper and Borchers can
do with good support against the Friscos.
Should the. Oakland.rs take a majority
of the series they will have a fair pros
pect of getting away from the tail end,
and unless the local team prove the
stronger of the two "Undo Hank" Harris

MEN CHARGED WITH THE REHABILITATION OF THE OLYMPIC ATHLETIC CLUB.
VIGOROUS in the extreme is the policy outlined by the new directorate of the Olympic Athletic Club. The men at the
head of affairs have all made their mark in the world of finance and come to the succor of the great athletic
Institution trained in the ways of business. Mr. Harrison, the president, left for the East on Thursday to â¢witness
the international yacht race. While there he will visit the various athletic clubs and glean ideas for his associates in
this city. Ht-- will endeavor to arrange for an Interchange of athletics whereby the best men of the East may visit this
coast and compete with the sprinters, jumpers and weight throwers. Mr. Houghton, the new superintendent, is a director
and is also treasurer of the Bohemian Club. John A. Hammersmith has served several times as leader and has made a
signal success in the position. John Elliott is the Xestor of athletics on this coast and a recognized authority on all the
sports of both path and field. Mr. Russ has been treasurer for thirty years, since the organization of the club. At times he
has had an overflowing strong box to guard, while again the opposite condition obtained. Mr. Hassell will lend strength to
the administration, being a man of marked executive ability.

i is expected next week.
Recording Angel, the phenomenal ten
months-old greyhound, will not be seen
!in competition for some months. She will
I be allowed to 1111 out and develop and will
then be an able representative of Callfor

entered in the Produce Btake and worked
I her way into fourth place, being beaten
;by the flying Clairs. The latter had the
advantage in age.
Daisy Clair is in the stake at Ingleslde

FOR A JOINT BENCH SHOW.
Talk of dog- shows is in the air. The
California Collie Club officials Intend to
hold a general dog show In Oakland about
the middle of next December. Norman
J. Stewart of Aromas will officiate as sec
retary and David J. Sinclair will act as
clerk. The show will be in connection
with the Oakland poultry exhibition and
will be held under the rules of the Pacific
Kennel League. Several prominent breed
ers have promised to show their dogs.
Among them the Verona Kennels will
exhibit the collies Old Hall Admiral and
Heather Mint; the Redwood cocker kin
nels will show their whole team of cham
pion spaniels and the Moiuez kennels' lm
portea mastiff puppy Dagonet Montez will
make his debut on the bench.
Closely following the Oakland show, the
Specialty Club's show will be held in this
city. Tho Pacllic Fox-terrier Club, Pacific
Mastiff Club, Pacific Bull-terrier Club
and St. Bernard Club of CaJifornia will
hold a joint specialty show. It Is prob
able that for ilii.s show an Eastern ,)udge
will be imported, although there is no
lack of experts on the coast. In fact, the
Collie Club has decided to rely on local
talent exclusively to judge at Oakland,
and that noted breeder of fox-terriers,
J. 13. Martin, has already been invited to
award the ribbons in the fox-terrier class.
For the specialty show a number of in
tending competitors favor recalling H.
I-acpy of Boston, while the predilection of
others is for Raper. The show will be
held under the American Kennel Club
rules.
The Vernna kennels are retiring 1 from
collies and are disposing of their stock.
The only ones to be retained are champion
St. Chi re Laddie, Mrs. PheÃe Hearst's
personal pet; champion Old Hall Admiral
and champion Heather Mint. H. T.
Payne has purchased the red cocker
spaniel dog Hamilton Jack, which took
second prize at Toronto.
Henry H. Carl ton has arranged to breed
his mastiff Hebe Montez to California
Cube. Mr. Carlton is negotiating for the
purchase of a Boston terrier to succeed
the late Oakside Bessie. His dlftli ulty
lies in the fact that BewlÂ« was the best
of her type, and none of the Eastern ken
nels have yet offered a fitting successor.
A. Bryan's great dane Green Olga will
be mated with J. L. Cunningham's Cham
pion Ivan.

FIVE-POUND
TROUT FOR A
FLYCASTER
George Crocker Lands One
of the Largest Fish of
the Season.
George Crocker has the honor of catch
ing one of the largest trout landed on the
Truckee this season. While fishing near
Mystic station with a party of friends
last Saturday he caught a trout weighing
just under five pounds. He used a No. 10
July dun fly, a remarkable small one for
so large a fish. In Mr. Crocker's party
were W. C. Murdoch, J. M. Quay and Ho
mer King and son.
Many of the representative fishermen of
the metropolitan district spent Saturday
and Sunday on the Truckee near Boca
and report splendid catches. Among oth
ers were W. D. Mansfield, A. T. Vogel
sang, A. S. Carmen, Alfred Sutro, Dr.
Trask, William Hanson and J. P. Morrill.
The fish caught by Mr. Mansfield and Mr.
Vogelsang wore served at the bi-monthly
meeting of the Fly Casting Club at Jules'

done well on the Truckee at dusk by using
the large Pelican Bay flies, allowing them
to sink In swift-running water.
Al Wilson and M. L. Cross spent Sun
day and Tuesday on the Oakland estuary
after striped bass and made gosd catches.
All information from Eel River is to the
effect that fishing Is rrmarkahly good,
many large fish having been caught. This
Is the height of the season and the river
is the objective point of all the steelhead
fishermen. John Butler, John Sammi,
John Lemmer and Colonel Kellhor left
on the steamer last Monday, while other
fishermen equally well known leave to
day.

will hold their postponed "Varmint" hunt
on their duck and quail preserve, Cor
delia, to-morrow. The members will go
to Cordelia to-night and will be ready for
the fray early to-morrow morning. Only

Scullers and Bargemen in
Active Training for the
Championships*
The annual convention of the Pacific
Association of the Amateur Athletic
Union will be hold on the 18th inst. in the
parlors of the Olympic Club. At a meet
ing held April 14 of this year the board
of managers approved an amendment to
the constitution, whereby the association
assumes control throughout the area of
its jurisdiction over rowing, indoor base
ball, basket ball, and sixteen other classes
of indoor and outdoor sports. This amend
ment will be presented to the convention
for final adoption, and will almost cer
tainly be carried. The foundation of the
Pacific Coast Rowing Association, with
headquarters at Astoria, will not affect
the status or control of rowing affairs in
and about San Francisco.
The Alameda Boating Club held a meet
ing last Tuesday. W. B. Hinchman, H.
W. Maass and S. J. Pembroke were elect
ed delegates to the Pacific Association,
and they were instructed to vote for the
first-named as a member of the board of
managers. After the meeting there was
a smoker to entertain the members of the
club who recently returned from the Phil
ippines and also from the Astoria regatta.
A regatta committee, composed of w. 8. .
Hinchman, chairman; S. J. Pembroke,
Captain W. G. Hansen, Lieutenant J.
Lewis <md Sydney Pollard, was appointed
to take charge of ladies' day, to be held
shortly. The sum of $150 was transferred
from the general fund to the boat fund,
the club being in need of racing skiffs and
some good pleasure boats. According to
the present rule an outrigged skiff may
not exceed 21 feet 6 inches in length,
or have less than 22 Inches beam.
As it !s not unlikely that some changes
may be made in the dimensions, allowing
greater length and narrowness, the row
ing clubs will be chary of expending
I money in new skiffs, which may rapidly
i become out of date. F. W. Avers, stroke
! of the Alameda senior four, will pull in
! the senior outrigged skiff race at the
championship regatta. J. Lewis will pull
in the junior outrigged skiff race, and
; probably others as well. Otto Meyer and
the Hawks brothers, who recently re
turned from Manila, will furnish good
material for a junior barge crew.
At the last meeting of the Souch End
Rowing Club Dr. C. C. Dennis, J. Foley
and R. McArthur were chosen delegates
to tho Pacific Association of the Amateur
Athletic I'nion. Walter Demartini and
C. E. Cashman were elected members of
the club. The South End Club is in a
prosperous condition, and has ten names
on its waiting list. It has found the strain
of constructing the handball court and
having a new barge built heavy, but it
finds the court a great attraction to men
disposed to join the club. On the second
Sunday in October the handball court will
be formally opened and a regatta given.
The only barge crew at present regularly
organized for the championship regatta
is made up of Dr. C. C. Dennis, J. Foley
Al Hampton and C. Skelly. It is out for
practice nearly every night. M. J. Breen
and J. Lyons will represent the South
Ends in the junior outrigged skiff race
while J. Foley will pull in a shell against
A. W. Pape.
The Ariels will make up a barge crew
with Robert Ellis, William Howe, James
Wilson and a fourth man for his cham
pionship regatta.
The Dolphin Boating Club will be well
represented in the championship regatta
next month. Dr. F. R. Axton and Lester
Hammersmith will enter the junior out
rigged skiff race, and A. \V. Pape, W O
Patch and George Baker will pull in the
senior outrigger skiff race. A. W. Pape I
and T. R. Keenan will enter the single i
shell race. An intermediate barge crew
has been made up of \V. Bush, bow F R

new members were elected at the last
meeting and will go into training as a
junior barge crewâ N. Neustadter, bow

LIBERTINE
LOSES BY A
SCANT NOSE
Petal, Well Ridden by But
ler, Defeats the Fa
vorite.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 15.â The airtight';
division had its finger? scorched this af
ternoon at Agricultural Park when frisky
cM Libertine at odds of 1 to 4 was beaten \
out a nose in the mile run by Petal, su- j
perbly ridden by the crack lightweight. '
Tommy Butler. Aside from the winner, j
â which Is a vastly improved filly with light
â weight up, the other starters were a
ragged lot.
George Snider tossed the leg over Lib- <
ertine, and when sent away immediately j
â¢went to the front. At 'the stretch turn j
Total was at his heel?, but not until a !
furlong from home did Snider realize his i
danger. Butler, on Petal, there drew up '
on even terms and by a master display
of horsemanship won on the wire by a
â nose In 1:414. Tommy Butler, who piloted
the winner, is at present unable to ride
on the big- tracks, but is destined to be
come one of the crack lightweights of the
country.
In the harness events the stake for
three-year-olds of the -.'Si class was cap
tured by Miss Barnabee, owned by By
ron Eikenbrecker of Los Angeles, and
Kelly Briggs, the Winters "pnenom," |
made his field look cheap in the 2:IS pace,
efter losing the initial heat. In the first
It was claimed he was "hooked up" (
wrong, a very shabby and time-worn
â apology.
In the running events Libertine was
not r he only beaten choice, for Princess j
Zelka, Meadow Lark and McManus were >
all felled.
The ride of Jack Ward on the first
named filly should have earned for that â 
enterprising youngster a long, long vaca- '
T.ion.
Miss Barnabee. driven by Walter Ma- |
lx-Â». opened a pronounced choice for the ;
2:13 trot, and although showing an in- ;
ciir.ation to act. better when trotted the j
reverse way of the track, took the first I
two heats in clever fasnion. The third heat '
she dropped to Lena A, but came hack }
game and steady in the fourth when rul- j
ii.g second choice, ending the struggle i
with something in reserve. Corona, the \
third starter, just seemed to get awak- â¢
ened as the smoke drifted away, finish- j
'ing a dangerously close second in ttiis â 
Leat.
At . Santa Rosa Kelly BrlggS showed
to be a "comer" and the eon of Bays- j
v at--: Wilkes brushed his company aside!
at leisure in the pace. Always an over- I
â¢whelming favorite he finished fifth in the
opening .it, but in the three following j
fit was like shooting the chutes for him. !
By ta-klng the first ieat John A earned ;
second money, with third money going to
Oonn.e. Rcblet, with Dick Havey In the !
bike, stepped two great heats, forcing the i
winner along, but in the last made a dis- '
nitrous break at the first turn, getting ;
the Hag.
After the downfall of Libertine the tal- j
c-n.t endeavored to get even by backing \
Princess Zeika to win the five and a half I
furlong scramble for two-year- Con
btellator led from the start, winning j
hands down. The favorite could have i
teen closer up, but was never given a
chance, leading out The Buffoon a nose j
for the place. Bamboulia was full of run
to the stretch, where he blew up.
McFarlane. a 10 to 1 shot, ridden by
Tullett led Rapido over the plate a short
head for the .seven-furiong run, but was
disqualified for the foul tactics of his
rider, Kapidu deservedly getting the j
purse. The ruling placed Portia second J
tnd Nonchalance third. Meadow Lark, i
with Marse up, never looked dangerous f
from the betting ring. i
A live-furlonj; mole for two-year
olds concluded the racing. Mandamus, \
with Jones in the saddle, went to the post |
un odds-on choice, and in a fierce drive
was beaten a head by Fairfax, piloted by
Buchanan, a very promising lad.

SHAMROCK'S SPIN ON
A MEASURED COURSE
A Comparison With Columbia Is Not
to the Disadvantage of the
American Yacht.
NEW TORK, Sept. 15.â After many days
of preparation the challenging- yacht
Shamrock to-day made her first trial in
American waters over a measured course.
Scotland lightship was the starting point,
and the distance covered was twenty
miles, ten miles to leeward and the same
distance on the wind In returning. I^lg-ht
and moderate breezes prevailed through
out the trlai. In this trial the Shamrock
was shown to be a clever boat In heating
to windward, but her down wind perform
ance vac disappointing. In time the
Shamrock required 1 hour 16 minutes and
30 seconds to run ten miles, while 1 hour
4,"> minutes and 20 seconds were taken on
the beat track.
In comparing the challenging yarht with
the Columbia, under similar conditions of
wind and weather, the American boat
not suffer. She seems minutes faster
than the Shamrock. Her enormous area
of canvas is carried well by the green
boat, but the angle of keei shown by the
Columbia in the same sort nf weather was
not greater than that of the stranger. The
fuss that the s'hanirock makes In The
water Is more than the Columbia has
shown. She causes a distinct hollowing
of the water under her lee rigging, and
a quartering wave that looks much like
proving a serious drag.
NEW YORK, Sept. 15.â The next races
between the yloop yachts Columbia and
Defender will take place off Newport, R.
L, next week. The Defender has sailed
for that place and the Columbia will fol
low her to-morrcw. The latter yacht went
went out for a trial spin on the Sound
to-day.
KING CARNIVAL
WILL REIGN AT
BELVEDERE COVE
A Brilliant Festival
Promised.
After months of planning and prepara
tion, the people of Belvedere are ready for
their water carnival representing a night
in far-away Venice. The festivities on the
water will begin at S:3O o'clock this even-
Ing. Special boats will leave the Tihuron
ferry at 7, 7:30 and 7:45 o'clock, and re
turning will leave at the conclusion of the
entertainment. For the accommodation of
Oaklanders, a boat will leave Tiburon at
10:30 o'clock. All the beats from Tiburon
will i"- special excursion steamers and
only carnival tickets will be accepted for
the passage.
Although first interest attaches to the
dcci rations of the arks, yachts and other
craft, the houses <>n the hillside will lend
effect to the brilliant picture. A dome has
been raised above one house and its out
lines will be marked with tiny electric
lights. Another ' design shows a huge
windmill, which will stand out boldly in
full view of all. Lanterns have long since
been at a premium, countless thousands
being used.
The music by the Third United States
Artillery band and by the male chorus of
fifty voices, led by Frank "W. Thompson,
should be heard to marked advantage.
The band will render â  â â¢â â¢â¢r d selections
before the assembling of the illuminated
boats. v\ hen the boat,* are in position the
island and the cove will be illuminated
with red fire. The boats will then go out
to meet the Dog of Venice, and after
suitable greetings escort him in. His
barge will be anchored in the cove and
then will come the espousal of the sea th.>
incident about which the carnival ' has
been built. The review of illuminated
boats and launches !by the judges will
follow;, the band rendering appropriate
selections throughout. The announcement
of the prize awards will be made by W
Fred Knapp. â  .â  "
An artistic programme, profusely illus
trated with views of Belvedere and yachts
and yachtsmen, has been prepared by the
committee. ;
The cove is thoroughly sheltered from
!Â£ c *Â£ g whic^ usual ii: sweeps in through

KID M'PARTLAND WINS
FROM OTTO SEILOFF
The Men Box Twenty-Five Rounds in
New York, but a Decision Is
Given by the Referee.
NEW YORK. Sept.ls.-Kid McPartland
of this city defeated Otto Seiloff of Chi
cago in a twenty-five-round bout at catch
weights before the Broadway Athletic
Club to-night. Seiloff was the heavier of
the two men by some eight or ten pounds
Selloff depended a great deal on right
swings, many of which landed effectively <
but the Kid offset these with hard left *
labs and frequent swings on face and '
body. In the fourteenth round McPart- !
land floored Seiloff with a left swing on <
the jaw and the bell saved the Western â¢
man from being counted out In the '
twenty-fourth round, with a succession of '
jabs, the Kid drew the blood from Seil- '
off' nose and mouth and weakened him I
with a few . heavy body blows. During '
the latter half of the fight it was plain
that Seiloff would come out second best I
In the final round McPartland swung j
heavily, landing frequently on Selloff's
head, but the latter lasted the limit and
at the finish both were weak. McPart
land got the decision.

BROODED OVER
A MURDER AND
LOST HIS MIND
Pitable Condition of
Eugene O'Rourke.
IS HOPELESSLY INSANE
AFTERMATH OF THE McMANTJS
SWEENEY KILLING.
Rather Than Testify at the Trial He
Leaves the City and Is Beaten by
the Murderer After His
Return.
Eugene O'Rourke. a shoe clerk, is locked
â  up in a padded cell In the Receiving Hos
! pital pending an examination as to his
; sanity. Yesterday morning O'Rourke,
1 who was armed with a revolver, visited
! the County Clerk's office, and as his ac
tions denoted that he was crazy he was j
taken to the insane ward and there con- j
flned.
O'Rourke, it is claimed, lost his reason ;
through brooding over the killing of Mc
j Manus, "the Gossoon," who was shot to ;
'.death by Charley Sweeney, the baseball i
â  player, some years ago. The unfortunate
; man was sleeping off the effects of a pro
i tracted debauch in the upper room of a
j saloon where the shooting took place, and
J did not learn of the killing until informed
iby a friend of the victim. It is said that
Sweeney endeavored to influence
O'Rourke to take the stand in his behalf,
and becoming alarmed he left the city.
Sweeney was convicted of the crime and â 
I sent to the penitentiary for seven years.
[ O'Rourke brooded over the murder, and .
it was noticed that his mind was becom
; ing Impaired.
Several months ago he met Sweeney in
| a saloon near the City Hall and attempted
to shake hands with him. The ex-ball
player, after roundly abusing him for not
appearing at the trial, struck him on the
jaw, knocking him out. O'Rourke subse
â  quently informed one of Chief Lees' men
of the occurrence, and he advised him to
i report the matter to Captain Spillane. The !
1 latter told O'Rourke to be on the alert,
j as Sweeney, when under the influence of
liquor, was quarrelsome and was likely to
wreak further vengeance on him.
Fearing that Sweeney was determined
to kill him, O'Rourke purchased a re
volver, determined to defend himself
against any further attack by the mur
derous ball player. The murder of "The I
Gossoon," coupled with the beating he i
had received at the hands of Sweeney,
greatly worried O'Rourke, and his rela
tives feared that his mind was giving way
! under the heavy strain.
â  Yesterday morning he went to the Coun- !
ty Clerk's office, and after complaining of â¢
i severe pains in his head asked for a doc
tor. He was promptly taken in charge
and removed to the insane ward of the
j Receiving Hospital.
Last night he was visited by several of
his relatives, who, tearing that he might
i injure somebody, are anxious to have him
committed to one of the asylums for the
insane. .. The surgeons at the hospital be
lieve that he is hopelessly insane.
NEW GOLF CHAMPION
OF THE UNITED STATES
Willie Smith of the Midlothian Club
of Chicago Captures the
Honor.
BALTIMORE, Sept. 15.â The open golf
championship of the United States was
won to-day by Willie Smith 01 tne Mid
lothian Club, Chicago, with a total for
the 72 holes of 315 strokes, after two days
of the hardest kind of play. Bo superior
was Smith's work that he led his nearest
opponents, Val Fitzjohn, George Low and
W. H. Way, who were all tied for second
place, by eleven strokes, while Willie An
derson, wno at the end of the first day's
play stuud at the head, was fifth, with
ATi. Jack Park of Orange, N. J., was sixth
with 32Â«; the new champion's brother,
Alec Sn th, was seventh, and Harry Gui
iane eiyliili, the two hitter being &>u iind
331 respectively. These <.-igat men all re
ceived money prizes, whne the champion
in addition was k,s y en a gold medal and
the en the < baxapionship cup for
a year, the three men tied for second
place dividing the money. The rest of
. eld waa .strung out behind, with the
amateur champion, Herbert M. Harri-
Bwn, well up to the leaders.
The play during the two days was with
out doubt the best ever seen in this coun
try, and Smith's 315 is a new mark for
the open event, being thirteen strokes
better than that made by Herd a T Myo
pia last year. No less than five men ex
ceeded Herd's score of 328. Still, the
Myopia course was larger than the Bal
timore, which no doubt accounted for
some of the differences, but it certainly
did not apply to the present champion.
Willie is a Canoustee man, like
his brother Alec, and through the 72 holes
he made very few mistakes. His game
is not as brilliant as others. notaWy An
derson's, but it has the "get there" gait
thai keeps him safe in the lead.
Of the three men tied for second place,
George *IÂ»w of Brooklyn played the most
brilliant game, while Way showed the
most consistent golf, although Fitzjohn
made very even scores. None played bo
surely as did Willie Smith, and at the end
of the morning round it looked as if Low
was out of the race entirely. He re
deemed himself by a fine 76 in the after
noon, and much to the surprise of every
one led Anderson at the finish. The latter
seemed unable to keep up the fast pace
which he developed during the first day,
and this year was a repetition of two pre
vious contests when he led the field at
that time by one or two strokes. Strange
ly as it seemed to his admirers. Anderson
was utterly unable to put to-day, ordi
narily the strong part of his game, while
his approaches failed to land dead, as
they did in nearly every cose during the
firSt day's playing.

HOT POLITICS AND
COLD POISON MIXED
MANY FISH ABE KILLED IN
THE GUADALUPE CREEK.
Santa Clara People Agitated Over
What They Assert Is a Plot to
Prevent Issuing Bonds.
A perplexing case of poisoning fish has
been called to the attention of the Fish
and Game Commissioners, who at once
sent Professor Scofield of Stanford to in
vestigate. The report was received from
a prominent member of the Santa Clara
sportsmen's association that a large
number of dead fish had been found on
the banks of Guadalupe Creek near the
town of Santa Clara. Professor Scofield
made a careful investigation of the
streams running from the Lick paper
mills and the Eberhardt tannery, but as
both institutions had been emptying their
refuse into streams flowing 'into the
Guadalupe for many years and no in
jurious effects had been observed the
cause was evidently not there. Most of
the dead fish were found near where ihe
Santa Clara sewer empties into the
stream. However, good healthy fish wen
found above and below the mouth of the
sewer, which perplexed the scientist not
a little.

I Yesterday Professor Scofield returned to
I the city and made a report to the com
i mission on a condition of affairs from
i which may be concluded that there le a
! political nigger in the Santa Clara wood
, pile. In the first place the city of Santa
! Clara is talking of issuing bonds for the
i construction of a gas plant, the pr.
being to save paying a high price for its
light to the gas company of San Jose.
This has been attempted several times.
but or each occasion the cry was raised
that the sewer of the smaller town should
be attended to first and the burden of two
improvements would be too heavy. Upon
i each occasion in substantiation or the ar
> g-ument dead fish supposed to have been
I poisoned by the sewer have been found
| near the outlet of the Santa Clara drain
i age.
It is openly asserted and even published
in the little town that designing and inter
parties have willfully poisoned the
: wat< rs of Guadalupe 'Creek, kill'ng the
: fish so as to divert attention from the
I question of bonding for a gas plant to the
reconstruction of the sewer system. Prof.
S-oiield holds aloof from all 'political dis
cussion of the question and reports his
conclusions from a scientific standpoint,
i which are these: First, a large quantity
! of fish was kijled; second, that the agent
i was poison; third, that it is unlikely that
i the poison came from either the tannery
1 or paper mill refuse, and last, there be
! ing plenty of healthy live fish below the
scw< r from Santa Clara it is doubtful
i that the poison originated in the natural
' refuse carried by the sewer and he poi
llke the pawnbroker's fire, must have
been "set."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
KKW YORK. Sept. There was pressure
to Fell Brooklyn Transit and St. Paul from
the outset to day. Brooklyn Transit occupied
the center of the stage all day. The dealings
In this stock were on an enormous scale and
the amount thrown overboard on the decline
mad* the fact of inside liquidation obvious.
The bears, of courFe, were also very active In
this stock ana occasional covering by this
element afforded the nnly effective check to
downward plunges of the stocks. There seemed
to be no support accorded at all until it had
touched 60. l'r m that stage there were oc
casional checks ami rallies before It touched
the extreme low point at 86%. After a final
rally to 88, it closed again under pressure at
a net losa of 6\. The other members of the
Flower group did not develop any keen sym
pathy until late in the day, when People's Gas,
Federal Stee: and Rock Island were down from
1% to 3 points. These stocks rallied some
what before the dose. Holders of St. Paul.
disappointed over yesterday's dividend action,
broke the price at the opening There was a
subsequent recovery of practically all the loss
and the whole railroad list moved up nearly
to last night's level, in a manner to suggest
the inauguration of an influential buying
movement. The appearance of strength was
increased by a brisk demand for the coalers
which rose from 1 to 3%. The upward move
ment came to an abrupt end before noon
when Brooklyn Transit. Sugar and the West
ern grangers generally, led by St. Paul fell
away by rapid degrees. St. Paul dropped to
129% and ruled below 130 for the rest of the
day. Except in a few Isolated cases, there
was no subsequent demonstration of strength
The clewing was irregular at net losses through
out. The depression on foreign stock markets
had some effect here, the drop to the low
point in St. Paul coming close upon the an
nouncement of the weakness in British con
sols. The apprehension of an unfavorable bank
statement to-morrow had its effect in the late I
break. Preliminary estimates indicate that
the banks have lost during the week by ship- '
ments to the interior and by Sub-Treasury I
operations over $5,000,000. Without taking ac
count of the reduction of deposit liabilities by
reason of the week's loan contraction this
would Indicate a fall in bank reserves to a
level of about 500.000 below the legal limit
bo that the loan contraction must have pro
ceeded to the extent at least of $14,000,000 in
order that the legal reserve should be pre
served intact and loans must have been re
duced as much as $24,000,000, in order to pre
vent a decrease from last week's small sur
plus reserve of less than $2,500,000. The quiet
tone of the money market during the latter
part of the week Indicates clearly that the
banks are within their legal reserve limit
Whether this la due to the fact that the
loan* have been reduced or whether there has
been a supply of cash from hidden sources
and not reflected In the known movement
â will be revealed by to-morrow's statement.
Foreign houses have loaned money during the
â week which was presumably borrowed in Lon
don for the purpose. This operation may have
gone further than has been suspected.
The bond market moved in sympathy with
etocks, "but changes as a rule were not large

Bradstreet's Financial Review.
NEW YORK, Sept. Bradstreet's finan
cial review to-morrow will Bay: . . .
Variations between strength and weakness In
the stock market have been more than usually
eharp during the last six days. A higher call
j loan market at the beginning of the week
caused heavy liquidation of public holdings of
j stocks and gave opportunity for successful bear
attacks by professional operators. The de
cline In prices thus brought about was checked,
however, by the somewhat better tone which
appeared In the call loan market on Wednes
day following the announcement that the Sec
retary of the Treasury would anticipate pay
ment of October interest on the 4 per cent
Government bonds, covering by the short In
terest, supplementing renewed bullish manipu
lation by the pools in several stocks thereupon
resulting In a general recovery throughout the
list. This lasted, however, only until Thursday
afternoon, when the fact that the St. Paul
directors made no Increase In the regular 2^
per cent semi-annual dividend on that stock,
as a part of the street had hoped they would,
resulted In renewed selling of the granger
stocks and some further losses in quotations
throughout the general liÃt. On Friday the
unsettling factor was the continued weakness
of Brooklyn Rapid Transit, which, causing de
-1 clines in other stocks controlled by the same
| Interests, brought about a bearish close.
I The rise of call loan rates this week was, of
I course, foreshadowed by the bank statement of
last Saturday. The reduction of the bank re
serves to nearly the legal limit constituted
a notice that should demand for funds at the
Interior continue with anything like its re
cent volume the New York banks, In order to
meet it, would be obliged to reduce their out
standing call loans to the stock market. This
Is what has occurred this week, though the
extent to which banks and other lenders have
I called in loans was probably exaggerated. The
I general marking up of the rate of accommo-
I dation by bankers to brokerage houses to 6
: per cent and the hardening of the time loan
: figures to 6O6Vi per cent were natural and
; proper steps under the circumstances. ThÂ»
quotations of as high as 9 per cent made for
; call loans at the Stock Exchange on Tuesday
'< and Wednesday would, however, represent to
â  some extent the temporary overanxlety of bor
; rowers and in a certain degree, also. the
â  manipulation of bearish speculative interests.
There was. in fact, no dearth of money, nor
! was the firmness In rates accompanied by any
j particular evidences of increased discrimina-
I tion In regard to the quality of collateral.
! Some further larger amounts of money are
said to have been loaned In the New York
market this week by Chicago Institutions, but
this assistance was not Important, and the
! quieting of money to a 6 per cent level was
| largely the result of the action referred to
i above taken by Secretary Gage, supplementing
I the discovery by the street that any acute
I fears on the score of stringency in money were
| premature. The decline in exchange rates,
i which was one of the results of the rise In In
terest, led to some discussion of the possibil-
I ity of gold Imports. It Is. however, generally
| concluded that at the present time a movement
j of that kind Is unlikely. Inasmuch as the sit
| uation in South Africa and the financial posi
tion at Berlin still Impose caution on the in
! ternational money markets and would produce
| resistance to any movement of specie to this
i country.

Bradstreet's on Trade.
Â«â _ â (>
NEW YORK, Sept. 15.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say:
With comparatively little stock or other
speculative activity and with few strong new
features presenting themselves, the general
business of the country goes forward at a good
j pace and with unprecedented volume for- this
! period of the year. Fall trade activity would
1 appear to be at Its maximum. Judging from
j advices of activity and strength of demand
I reported alike from Western and Eastern mar
kets, and shared in also by most South At
lantic and interior Southern cities.- Yellow
fever at some Southern points, resulting In
quarantine regulations, has tended to restrict
business at a few markets, notably New
Orleans, while unfavorable crop and weather
conditions limit business at Galveston. Iron
and steel are quiet but very strong at the
East. Mast furnace reports show that cur
rent consumption and production are not far
apart, but production fails to show the ex
pansion looked for, and while current work
is at the rate of 14.000,000 tons per year, esti
mates of the year's production do not reach
much beyond 13.000,000 tons. The notable
strength In cereals this week Is shown In
corn, where paucity of old supplies leads to
the rumor of a September "squeeze." Little
seems to be noted in wheat, though the Gov
ernment report was temporarily stimulating.
Weather conditions are partly responsible for
the better demand for butter. Crude petroleum
is also stronger and leather and hides are
scarce and firm. Cotton is a shade lower on
the week, owing mainly to the failure of for
eign spinners to accept current Government
and other advices as to cotton crop conditions.
The strength of cotton goods is, however, not
able. Lumber retains all Its old strength and
some new buying Is responsible for present
advanced quotations at several centers. This
is true also of most building materials, with
the exception of brick, which Is rather weak
owing to reported over-production. Wool is
firm at all and higher at some markets, and
much Interest Is taken In the next London
[ wool sales. Woolen goods are strong, though
some manufacturers complain that the i ad
vance In raw material has outstripped the gain
in the .manufactured product. A number' of
mills are reported to have Instructed their
agents that their order books for spring de
i livery are filled.
Wheat. Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4,000.000, against 4,453,906 last
week, 3,675.291 bushels in the corresponding
week of 1898: 6.289,948 bushels In 1897; 3,506,322
bushels In ISS6 and 2. .'53, 085 bushels In 1595.
Since July 1 this season the exports of wheat
aggregate 42,012,798 bushels, against 36,469,091
bushels last year and 44,602,700 bushels in
1897-98.
Business failures for the week number 149,
against 123 last week and 173 In this week a
year ago, and compared with 169 In 1897. 315
In 1896 and 218 In 1895.
Canadian failures number 24 for the week,
as compared with 21 last week, 20 In this
; week a year ago, 36 In 1897. 41 In 1896 and
j the same number In 1895.
Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK, Sept. 16.â R. O. Dun tc Co.'s
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
Better than all other news the record of August
commerce shows the relation of United States
business to that of other countries. Exports
were $20,082,815 larger than ever before In Au
gust and exceeded imports by $37,929,699, partly
because exports of staples were $9,366,978 larger
than last year, but also because exports of
â¢ â tlirr products, mainly manufacturing, were
$10,349,000 larger than last year and larger than
any other month of any year. Fears that a
great advance In prices might shut off exports
of manufactured products have not been un
natural, and It is most gratifying to find such
exports continue and expand. The excess of
exports over Imports gives fair promise of as
large a balance in foreign trade to the benefit
of this country during the winter as has ever
been seen. That manufactured exports do not
fall oft*, but are larger than ever, is both sur
prising and gratifying. The volume of busi
ness now in progress has never been rivaled.
The great movement of grain, in wheat and
flour. Is a little larger than last year in Au
gust and In two weeks of September 8,!i20,273
bushels, flour included, from Atlantic ports,
against 5,423.076 last year, and from Pacific
ports 765.659 bushels, against 364,144 last year,
which is far more effective In preventing a
decline in prices than any official or unofficial
estimate of yield. Government reports indi
cate a wheat crop of only 616,000,000 bushels,
but last year the September report indicated
685 000,000 bushels and afterward the official re.
turns made it 676,000,000. One would not be sur
prised to see a like revision this year. The
price In spite of good exports, has fallen >4c.
For western receipts have been 18,669,456 bushels
in two weeks, against 14,663,895 last year, and
com exports 6,083,212 bushels, against 4,351.331.
The feeling Is not unreasonable that foreign
nei>ds are Just now well Indicated by the com
movement. At this season cotton shipments
are always small and hopes or fears rule the
market, but prices have declined during the
week l-16c, with a little less buying on foreign
account.
Extraordinary efforts to Increase the iron out
put failed in August, partly because the stop
page of a few large furnaces for repairs more
than balanced the addition of thirteen small
furnaces to the producing force and partly be
cause hot weather prevented full production

of Bessemer and 20,000 of other Iron are re

The heavy sales of wool. 12.056,300 pounds for
the week and 21 282 100 for two weeks, against
36,629.400 In 1888, are largely due to heavy manu
facturing purchases at Boston, but there, as
elsewhere, the buying Is mostly based on ex
pectation that London sales . beginning next
Tuesday will show an important advance.
Prices here are stiff and the demand for woolen
goods of all sorts is strong. - . ..

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Sept. 15.â Wheat opened a trifle
lower than It closed yesterday. ThÂ« decline
] in September was quite marked, but deferred
1 futures had some outside support and resisted ;
j the influence of the lower cables and heavy
) primary receipts, prices for over two hours
' holding close. to opening: quotations. The mar
j ket during that time, outside of the short j
' period of activity in September, was excep- |
j tionnlly dull. The strength of December was
mostly artificial, as a good deal of . changing
| was done from September to December, and
I though price changes were narrow, the gen
eral feeling In the pit was one of heaviness.
The September premium in the meantime en
i tirely disappeared and the price of that op-
I tion finally declined to a point about %c
! under December, with elevator people appar
ently willing to sell even at that figure. Up
to within about thirty minutes of the close,
trading was the dullest in weeks. Toward
the end of the session more activity was
shown. The seaboard reported a good demand
with about fifty loads engaged. The North
west markets, previously rather weak, turned
firmer and local shorts, not satisfied with
their position in view of the stubbornness of
December, covered their early sales. Decem
ber became quite firm near the close with
prices gradually advancing. Atlantic port
clearances of wheat and ' flour aggre
gated 439.000 bushels. â¢ Argentine shipments
! were liberal, 1,040. bushels, which was given
as one of the reasons for the weakness in
foreign markets. The Northwest promises an
Increase of stocks of about 1,100,000 bushels,
which indicated a visible increase of over
1,500.000 bushels. December opened He lower
at 70%@70%c. It declined, to 70% c and advanced
to 70%071C near the close. It closed at 70% c.
September sold as low as 70c and closed at
70% c. a decline of %c. . â  - - 'Â . -
Corn was very dull but steady until near
the end of the session, when a sudden advance j
in September was caused by good buying by
shorts who were influenced by the large cash
demand and the late strength in December
wheat. December closed %c higher and Sep- !
tember gained %c.
Oats were steady all day. Near the close
the strength of wheat and corn was sym
pathized in and prices advanced under good
general buying. December closed with a gain
Provisions were steady early with the firm
hog market, prices holding close to yesterday's
closing figures. Late In the session Cudahy
selling pork started the local crowds In the
same direction and prices suffered a little all
around. The close was about 2%<?<se lower for
all.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been four deliveries of coal from
Washington, 11.200 tons; three from British Co
lumbia, 6423 tons; two from Oregon, 800 tons; â 
one from Swansea, 3050 tons; total, 21,473 tons.
This amount at hand leaves us about 8000 tons ,
short of our requirements for the week, bo that
the stock of fuel In yard Is being largely dimin
ished. Coal producers are using every endeavor
to secure modes of transportation to market,
with but meager success so far. Next month '
there will be some available steamers due,
which have been in some cases purchased, and '
some time charters, which will partially ease
up stocks. This could not be foreseen by any
one, as the partial failure of demand for steam
ers for the Klondike, it was naturally supposed,
would divert those vessels to the coal trade,
whereas the department steps In and takes them
all and asks for more. The increased Honolulu
demand was not figured upon â year it has
quadrupled Itself: considerable of this Is drawn
from our local collieries on the coast, thus de
priving us of tonnage which naturally belongs
here. We are not threatened with an absolute
fuel famine this winter, simply a scarcity of
sufficient magnitude to insure high prices for
several months to come. The values of domes
tic grades, have not been changed, they are
identical with last year, and will probably re
main unchanged all through the winter months.
Steam fuel Is showing better figures."

eecms to sit heavily upon the Tiv ill shoul
3ers.. "If you would appreciate "Wagner,"
Bay the knowing ones, "study motiv-leit
motiv, then go to Bayreuth and hear the
operas in the dark, with orchestra con
cealed, with the performance brought to
the highest perfection." And they are
right. Wagner demands what 30 cents
has riot yet bought. The first act moves
.well, and the curtain falls upon spontan
eous, genuine applause. After that wear
lnc-sa settles, and about everything is,
from time to time, a shade under the
pitch. I except Baron Berthald. Pictor
laliy and vocally, he is as fine a Lohen
grin as I have heard. In Italian he sings
well; in German, his voice, especially in
the middle and lower registers meets all
the demands of artistic treatment. It is
beautiful. Besides, he thinks the part.
Pro=snltz sings Elsa seriously and well,
but neither looks nor act.= the character.
The other roles are fairly well sustained.
Dramatically Mehrtens, though at times
too vehement, deserves a word of prau-e.
Mary Linck intend? honestly enough, but
certain limitations result in her being sim

might be sharpened an.V winged promis

would seldom fail to strike home. Their
costuming offends ; the esthetic sense. in
How different witn "Othello. Save in
the first act, it demands nothing of the
chorusâ but little of the women. Salas
ea-8 voice is -magnificent. His l *BÂ° T par
allels the original dramatic thread. If you
would recognize true histrionic worth,
watch his Ingo. The soliloquy which
precedes the stratagem of act II exhibits
the genuineness of the artist. Avedano
has sacrificed somethingânot much-for
lii* high notes, and they ring out like a
bell: His Othello catches the Â« rarnaUc
Fpirit from lago. and the duet brings the
house to its feet with bravas. Anna Llch

"ROUGH HOUSE" METHODS PREVAIL AT BERKELEY.
BERKELEY. Sept. 15.â Pandemonium broke out among the underclassmen of the University
of California this morning. It was not a premeditated outburst, and it quieted down almost
as suddenly as it started, but for the time being some two or three hundred students lost
their heads r>'gi:rdl^ss of university property, of the dignity of university professors or of the
penalty of expulsion fnim college.
iVhen everything was over the l< wer part of the south end of North Hall on the campus
looked as though th-:- city tire department had just â¢-â xtingulshed a blnze. Windows were smashed,
chairs in the recitation rooms, were in chaos, and from the steps and windows dripped the remnants
of the water whjch inside had given things a liberal soaking.
Berkeley collegians will not admit it was a rush. That is for diplomatic reasons. They pre
fer to term it "a general all-round rough house." There may be some degree of difference be
tween these two expressions. Perhaps the faculty may be disposed to recognize the distinction. If
they do not it will go hard with the ringleaders of the fracas.
Ever since last year the faculty have had the ax ready for the first students who might be
overcome with the rushing spirit. The college is waiting breathlessly to see if it is now going to
fall. General consent places the responsibility f'-r *the affair upon the sophomores. It is said that
they incited the freshmen to violence.
The trouble began at a meeting of the freshmen class held in one of the big recitation rooms
drunkard and unfit to act as admlnlstra
tor. A host of witnesses were put on th.
stand, all of whom spoke decidedly wel
of Patrick's reputation, and Judge Hal
therefore granted his petition.

NATIONAL HOLIDAY
TO BE CELEBRATED
The eighty-ninth anniversary of the na
tional Independence of Mexico will be cel
ebrated with all due honor to-day by the
local Mexican colony, which numbers
nearly 4000. Heretofore two celebrations
have marked the day owing to the dif
ferences between factions in the colony.
This year there will be but one official
ration, which will be held under the
auspices of the Mexican celebration com
mittee, which is headed by Hon. A. K.
Coney. Consul General of Mexico. Odd
Fellows' Hall, which has been secured for
the occasion, will be beautifully decorated
with American and Mexican colors and
portraits of heroic Mexican and American
Presidents.
The memory of Miguel Hidalgo, the
"Washington" of Mexico, and Benito
Juarez will be reviewed. Hidalgo, the
warrior priest, did not long survive the
outbreak for independence, for after some
unsuccessful engagements the troops of
the Spanish Viceroy defeated and dis
persed the ' ill-organized and 111-armed
battalions of the liberators. Hidalgo was
captured and executed in 1811, but the ex
ample he had set spurred others on to
emulation and the sword he had been
forced to lay down was taken up by
More-lon, who, like Hidalgo, was. a priest,
and who shared his fate in 1815. Prior to
his death he called a national assembly
at llpanzingo and by this body Mexican
Independence was for the first time offi
dally proclaimed. Under the leadership
of Iturbldo independence was again pro
claimed on February 24, 1821. Following
is [he programme for to-night's enter
tainment:
Overture by the orchestra; Installation of
the celebration committee; reading of the

NEWS OF THE REALTY WORLD
JUDGING from visible results, the real
estate market has been far from ;
.hiring the past week, but the
public records do not indicate the
amount of negotiating that if going on
between the broken and would-be pur
chasers of desirable Investment property.
It is a fact that there is more money seek
ing Investment in San Francisco realty j
now than has been the case in months, If I
nut years; but owners appear disinclined
to sell, being apparently satisfied to hold '
on and await better prices, which every- j
body seems to feel sure will prevail be- ,
fore another twelve months have passed.
As one real estate man said yesterday: ;
"There has not been so much money ',
looking for investment in real estate in
this city for years as there is right at this
time, and it is only a question of time ;
and a sh'>rt time at thatâ when this money
Will be placed. There is bound to be a
fcr.-;u <i.al of activity in real --state circles
tl - coming fall and winter, and I believe
that San Francisco has entered upon an ,
era of prosperity which bids fair to stay
with us a long time."
There are at least half a dozen deals j
now pending Involving thousands of dol
tars each which would have been con
summated weeks ago but for the fact
that Haws were discovered m the titles,
which must be rectified before deeds can
be passed and the transaction go on reo- i
Â«jkl. in one Instance negotiations for |
propertj valued at over JtfiO.uOO are at a;
standstill because of the discovery of a j
Haw in the title. Brokers all have plenty
, and they are feeling in excellent
spirits. They say the outlook for a big
fall business could not be more encour
aging, and they profess perfect satisfac- >
tlon with the existing state of affairs.
While there has been a slight falling off
in the number of building contracts liled
during the week, there is great activity
in building circles. There are more good,
- tfastantial buildlnps now being erected in
San Francisco than at any one time be
fore it] years. The work of laving track ]
for the new electric railway on Sansome j
and Montgomery streets will soon be i
completed, and when the cars are run- j
ning along those thoroughfares tmd the \
bitumen pavement is laid on Montgomery !
sir^.t that part of town will take <>n a
new lease or life. In fact, old buildings
are already being remodeled in prepara
tion for the changed conditions and busi
ness men In thai Election of the city are
anticipating a healthy revival.

J J. Evans & Co. have leased for Mrs.
W. H. Jordan the beautiful residence on
the northeast corner of Fillmore and Pa
cific avenue for a term of years v
in North Hall. The freshmen, with a fair sprinkling o f co-eds, filed into the room and barricaded
the doors. So far they were safe. But tnere was one vulnerable point which they had completely
overlookedâ the windows. Hardly had the meeting got well under way before smash went a win
d"\v and n heavy rock rolled out into the middle of the floor. Soon through the big hol*> came a
heavy stream of water, sent in through a large hose calculated for extinguishing lire. The fresh
men were drenched. It was an insult which could not be overlooked and they cried for revenge.
Some piled out of windows, others smashed through the deor. but everywhere tiiere was
water. The unruly sophomores held to the hose, and it was long before the overwhelming num
ber of freshmen could wrench from them their powerful weapon. Then ensued a regular siege, and
more windows were smashed and more drenching followed. The freshmen formed into a column
and charged up the steps, but again the hose came into play and the column retreated. Some one
yelled for a rope, and that meant an old-time rush, but the appearance of several professors re
stored order in time. '
Then the men began to see the mess they had made. They could not undo it. however. There
were the broken windows, the drenched freshmen and the flooded recitation room, all strong evidence
that the rules of the college had been broken.
The action of the faculty will be determined by the report of the students" affairs committee
upon the fracas, and it is rumored that grave consequences may ensue.

SHE NEGLECTED
HER HUSBAND
FOR A SOLDIER
Jesse A. Andrews Is
Given a Divorce.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ â  Broadway, Sept. 15.
On the strength of some very sensation
al testimony given before Superior Judge
Ellsworth, Jesse A. Andrews was to-dgy
granted a diVorce from Emma P. An
drews. The parties were married In Oc
tober, 1595, and the suit was filed some
time ago. In his complaint, prepared by
Attorney W. H. Waste, the aggrieved
husband alleged the grossest unfaithful
ness on the part of his wife, naming 1
Clem Hill, a young San Franciscan, as
corespondent. According to Mr. Andrews'
testimony the season of marital happiness
went on in an even tenor until hostilities
between this country and Spain were be
gun i.r.d volunteers came flocking into
San Francisco from everywhere. It was
then that Mrs. Andrews began neglecting
her household duties to bask in the smiles
of patriotic warriors in their blue uni
forms and brass buttons.
This went on until the neglected
spouse's suspicions werr- aroused to that
extent that he determined upon a sum
mary investigation and on July 12 last
he followed his wife across the bay to
San Francisco, where she entered a
lodging-houst-. Andrews' heart failed
him here for"*nearly half an Hour, but
finally mustering up his courage and as
certaining the location of the room his
wife had entered he forced open the door
and what h e then paw had best be left
untold. Suffice it to say that Mrs. An
drews' temporary roommate had a nar
row escape with his life. Shortly after
ward the divorce suit, was filed. The hus
band is a grainer by occupation.
Loelia M. Dailey. through her attorney,
Robert B. Gay lord, filed suit !n the Su
perior Court late this afteVnoon for a
divorce from Edward B. Dailey. The par
ties were married in 15 . . . and in her com
plaint the wife alleges continuous acts
of cruelty and abusive talk on the part
of htr spouse as the ground for her cause
of action.
IRON CRANK PUNCHED
HOLE INTO HIS TIBIA
OAKLAND, Sept. 15.â Patrick Flynn.
ag< j d 80 years and residing on Sixth street,
near Franklin, sustained a horrible injury
early this eveninp while working about
a d. rnck lifting huge stones on Fruitvale
avenue. Several others were at work on
the derrick and for some reason they lost
control of the machine, when the iron
crank struck Flynn's right if-g. causing a
(â .impound fracture just below the knee
and the end punching a hole into the bone
about the size of a half dollar. He was
promptly removed to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Drs. Stratton and Rowe re
duced the fracture and dressed the
wounds, but his recovery, owing to loss
of blood and his old age, is not assured
by any means.

FINANCES LOW
AT GARDEN CITY
â¦
Police and Firemen Will
Again Suffer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 15.â There promises to
be another shortage of city finances dur
ing the present fiscal year, which com
menced July 1, and already steps have
been taken looking to a curtailment in
fhe different city departments.
The fire and police departments, which
I suffered such a financial cramp last year,
are to be the victims again this year.
This is due to the small apportionments
to be made" for these departments. Last
year the members of the fire department
I were compelled to work six weeks for
j nf. thing and the police lost two weeks'
p-ilarv In all probability the same thing j
will happen this year. Besides this the ;
police and fire-men will be compelled to
I cash the warrants they do get at a dis
j count with some broker, as for some
months thero will be no available funds.
At the meeting of the Police and Fire i
I Commissioners next Tuesday two and
i perhaps three policemen will be dropped. I
i There is also a proposition belrjj consid- |
1 ored to reduce the salary of policemen j
' from $75 to $70 per month. Even with this j
I cut there will not be enough money to go |
! around.
The city will also be inconvenienced. At
present there are only fourteen patrol
men, and many believe that instead of
reducing the force it should be increased j
about five men.
There may also be a cut made In the
pay of the 'fire department.

VACANT OFFICES
IN SAN JOSE
Complaints Against the
Governor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN* JOSE. Sept. 15.â The politicians of
this city and county are anxious to know
just when the Governor is going to give
his attention to a couple of vacancies ex
isting in county offices. The citizens also
are interested. The Governor so far has
paid no attention to their appeals and has
expressed no desire to hurry in the mat
ter.
The Supervisorship in the Fifth Dis
trict has been vacant since the death of >
B. F. Ayer, some four months ago. This
delay in making the appointment has
greatly inconvenienced the people of that
district, as there is considerable road
work in the district requiring immediate
attention.
Politicians, have kowtowed to the ex
ecutive in behalf of their men, but with
out success. Even Senator Shortridge,
who is believed to be very close to the
I Los Angeles man. has made several trips
| to Sacramento in regard to the matter. ;
i There are any number of suitable men ;
iin the field. Fred Cottle has the support ,
of the Rea forces and Shortridge, and
seems the most likely candidate. In fact,
so long has the matter dragged that many |
have retired from the race.
It is said that Assemblyman Walter j
Clark of Mountain View has been given i
the privilege of naming the Supervisor if j
he agrees to get in the Burns column at ;
the special session of the Legislature that
is likely to be called this winter. Clark.

Department 3 of the Superior Court
is without a Judge, the vacancy being
caused by the death oi Judge A. S. Kttt- j
rodge. Ex-Boss Rea wants D. W. Bureh
ard to get the place. Johnnie Macken- ;
zie is supporting Howell C. Moore and
Senator Shortridge is working in the In
terests of John E. Richards, lately from
San Francisco. J. C. Black and several
other prominent lawyers would not be
averse to wearing the judicial robe.
There is also an appeal before the Gov
ernor from the Alumni Association of the
State Normal School here asking him to
Interfere with the action of the trustees
and remove Principal James McNaughton ;
against whom charges of immorality and i
I incompetency hnd been made. This com
mittee has been given a cold snub, and the
Governor has not even acknowledged the
receipt of tho communication.

INHERITANCE TAX IS
NOW CONSTITUTIONAL
Supreme Court So Decides in
the Stanford Estate Case.
Its Former Exposition of the Law Entirely
Reversed--The State School Fund Will
Be Enriched by Many Hundred
Thousands of Dollars.
IX an opinion handed down yesterday
in the matter of the estate of Lel.-uid
Stanford, deceased, the Supreme
Court has held as constitutional the
act of March 23. 1593. as amended four
vcors after, In the matter of taxing ool
iateral inheritances. This opinion, which
was written by Justice Van Dyke and
concurred in by Chief Justice Beatty
and Justices Temple and Garoutte. re
verses the decision in the same case
written about a year ago by Justice Har
rison.
' In yesterday's decision Justice Harri
son dissented. The law as laid down
yesterday applies to every estate in Cali
fornia over $500 in value and puts immedi
ately into the school fund nearly $300,000.
When Senator Stanford died ho left a
will In which, among other bequests, he
gave $2,600,000 to trustees for the benefit
of the university ho had established, and
52.2iw.000 to certain of his nephews anil
niece's residing in this State and In the
East.
â¢ The District Attorney of this county,
on behalf of the Treasurer, brought an
nction against Mrs. Stanford, us admin
istratrix, for $236,750 taxes on the collat
eral inheritances mentioned. In the lower
court Judgment went in favor of the law
and an appeal was taken to th., Supreme
Court by Mrs. Stanford. Justice Harri
son's decision reversed the Judgment of
the lower court. His position was that
the legislative amendment of L 897, exempt
ing local heirs' and ;axing foreign heirs'
Inheritances was a discrimination and
hence the act and amendment were un
constitutional. This decision was regard
ed as a great victory, as it was a Hard
blow to tne inheritance lax act.
W F. Fitzgerald, then Attorney Gen
eral made application to the Supreme
Court for a rehearing of the case, bas
ing his petition on tne ground that tne
Slate was 41 party In the case, and as us
legal representative ho had never been
served with a notice of appeal. i'he
t?:at.-'s Interest lay in the loss or gain to
its school fund. '; he motion was granted
and Mr. Fitzgerald, retiring from office,
his successor, . Irey L. Fora, pursued tne
case to yesterday's victory lor the btate.
In the" decision the constitutionality of
the act under consideration is upheld on
the ground that the tax in question is
not upon the property but upon the right
of succession, nd the right of the Legis
lature to lmpo.se an excise tax includes
tho right to select the subjects upon
which it shall be imposed, The reason
for the mount now due, about $300,000,
being greau-r than the amount sued tor,
sÂ£ii.i:>o, is on - ount of the penalties at
tached lor non-payment of the tax, as
shown in the following decision:
IN BANK.
In the matter of the estate of Le
land Stanford, deceasedâ F. No. 571.
Inland Stanford died June 21, 1593,
leaving a last will and testament by
which he gave the sum of .$2,5u0,000 to
certain trustees lor the benelit of the
Leland Stanford Jr. University, and
also legacies amounting to $2,200,000 to
certain of his nepbews and nieces.
April 14, IS9O, the Superior Court of
Sian Francisco, in which the settlement
01 said estate was pending, on the ap
plica of the Treasurer of the city
und county of San Francisco made an
order requiring Jane L. Stanford, as
executrix of tne last will an<l testa
ment of said !..â¢ land Stanford, de
ceased, to pay into the treasury of
said city ana count) $235,750 as ana for
a tax on collateral inheritances. From
this order an appeal was taken May
IS, 1896. The act under which the or
der directing the inheritance tax to be
paid over was approved March 23, 1893,
and took effect sixty days thereafter.
(Statutes 1693, page 193.) It is entitled
"An act to establish a tax on col
lateral inheritances, bequests and de
vises, to provide for its collection and
to direct the dispostion of the pro
â¢ â¢ Is." The first section reads as
follows
"Section 1. After the passage of this
act all property which shall pass by
will or by the Intestate laws of this
State from any person who may die
seized or possessed of the same while
a resident of this State, or if such de
cedent was not a resident of this State
at the time of death, which property,
or any part thereof, shall be within
this State, or any Interest therein or
income therefrom which shall be
transferred by deed, grant, sale or
gift, made In contemplation of the
death of the grantor or bargainer, or
intended to take effect in possession or
enjoyment after such death, to any
person or persons, or to any body poli
tic or corporate, In trust or otherwise,
or by reason whereof any person or
body politic or corporate shall become
beneficially entitled, in possession or
expectancy, to any property, or to the
Income thereof, other than to or for
the use of his or her father, mother,
husband, wife, lawful Issue, brother.
Bister, the wife or widow of a son, or
the husband of a daughter, or any
child or children adopted as such In
conformity with the laws of the State
of California, and any lineal descen
dant of such decedent born in lawful
wedlock, or the societies, corporations
and Institutions now exempted by law
from taxation by reason whereof any
such person or corporation shall be
come beneficially entitled, In posses
sion or expectancy to any such prop
erty, or to the income thereof, shall be
and is subject to a tax of five dollars
on every hundred dollars of the mar
ket value of such property, and at a
proportionate rate for any less
amount, to be paid to the Treasurer
2 {^ th< i r/oper county, as hereinafter
defined, for the use of the State; and
all administrators, executors and
trustees shall be liable for any and all
such taxes until the same shall have
been paid, as hereinafter directed*
provided, that an estate which may 'be
valued at a leas sum than five hun
dred dollars shall not be subject to
such duty or tax."
Section 4 reads: "All ta-xes Imposed
by this act. unless otherwise provided
for. shall be due and payable at the
death of the decedent, and If the same
are paid -within eighteen months no
Interest shall be charged and collected
thereon, but if not so paid, interest
at the rate of 10 per centum per an
num shall ne charged and collected
from the time said tax accrued; pro
vided, thnt if said tax Is paid within
six months after the accruing thereof
a discount of C per centum shall be
allowed and deducted from said tax.
And In all cases where the executors
administrators or trustees do not
pay such tax within eighteen months
from the death of the decedent, they
shall be required to give a bond, In
the form and to the effect prescribed
jn section 2 of this act. for the pay
ment of said tax. together with In
terest." In another section it Is pro
vided that if litigation becomes neces
sary- or If for other unavoidable cause
for delay the estate cannot be settled
at the end of eighteen months, then
only 7 per cent should be charged. The
tax paid over to or collected by the
County Treasurer Is by him required
to be paid Into the treasury of the
Stale for the use of the State school
"After the appeal herein was perfect-
After the appeal herein was perfect
ed this court, in- re Wilmerding. had
occasion to consider the nature and
character of this collateral inheritance
tax, and therein, also he d the act
in question to be constitutional. (117
Cal.. 251.) In the opinion in that case
It is said: "Similar statutes have
been enacted in other States, and.
â¢with the exception of New Hampshire,
have been sustained by the courts in ,
thope States, upon the ground that
the charge thus Imposed Is in the na
ture "i an excise tax or .1 tax upon
. t he right of succession, and is within
the constitutional power of the Legis
lature. (Citing a number of cases of
the various States.)
"The principles upon which the tax
is upheld have, been so fully and
clearly elaborated In the above cases
that it is necessary to ';â â¢ no more
than refer to the cases. The right of
inheritance. Including the designation
of heirs arid the proportions which the
several heirs shall receive, as well as
the right of testamentary disposition,
are entirely matters of statutory en
actment, and within the control of the
Legislature. As it is only by virtue
of the statute that the heir is en
titled to receive any of his ancestor's
estate; or that the ancestor can divert
his estate from the heir, the same
authority which confers this privilege
may attach to It the condition that a
portion of the estate so received shall
be contributed to the state, and the
portion thus to be contributed is pe
culiarly within the legislative discre
tion." And, again: "As this tax is
not upon property, but upon tne right
of succession, the constitutional pro
vision that all property shall be taxed
according to Its value is inapplicable.
The right of the Legislature to impose
an excise tax Includes the right to se
lect the subjects upon which it shall
be imposed."
In Estate of Smith, 137 N. V.. 83, cited
by appellants, that court, In speaking
or this question, says: "The precise
definition of the nature of this tax is
not essential, If it Is susceptible of
exact definition. Thus far in this court
we have not thought It necessary in
the cases coming before us to deter
mine whether the object of taxation is
the property which passes or not;
though In some expressions may be
found which seem to regard the tax;
In that light." (Referring to a num
ber of cases in that State. "The idea
of this succession tax, as we may con
veniently term it. Is more or lees com
pound; the principal Idea being the
subjection of property, ownership of
which has ceased by reason of the
death of the owner, to a diminution,
by the state reserving to itself a por
tion of its amount, if in money, or
of its appraised value if In other lorms
of property."
The decision In the W'ilmerding case
would have disposed of this appeal
were it not that the act in question
was amended by the Legislature of
I 1 The act of 1897 is entitled. "An act
to amend an act entitled 'An act to
establish a tax on collateral inherit
ances, bequests and devises, to pro
vide for its collection and to direct the
disposition of the proceeds.' approved
March 23. 1893." It amends section 1
of the act of 1893 by including among
those who are exempt from the tax
the niece or nephew when a resident
of this State, along with certain classes
of rations, of which the above
named university is one.
Such amendatory act contains an
Independent section, numbered 2. read
ing as follows: "The exemptions con
tained in this act shall apply to all
property which has passed, by will,
succession or transfer, since the ap
proval of the act of which this act Is
amendatory, except in those cases
where the tax has been paid to the
Treasurer of the proper county." It
1- claimed on the part of the appellants
that the appeal herein must be deter
mined in accordance with the act of
ISM. as amended, referring, in support
of such contention, to Bank vs. Hen
derson. 101 Cal., 307, and other cases in
the same line. Such decisions are to
the effect that in certain cases where,
subsequent to the appeal, matters arise
affecting the same, upon proper sug
gestion and proof of such matters they
will be considered by the appellate
court; specially is this so when the ac
tion is of a penal characther, as it
was in the Henderson case.
On the other hand, It is contended
upon the part of the respondent that
the amendatory act in question, so far
as it attempts to relieve these appel
lants and other beneficiaries similarly
situated from the condltions_or obliga
tions contained in the act of iv"), being
In effect a relinquishment to them of
the sums due the State under said act,
is unconstitutional and void.
It will be seen by the express terms
of the act of 1593 all taxes imposed
thereby "shall be due and payable at
the death of the decedent." And also
that such taxes "shall be immediately
due and payable to the Treasurer of
the proper county."
By section 25. article IV, of the con
stitution It in declared :> "The Legisla
ture shall not pass local or special
laws in the following enumerated
cases, that is to say: â¢ â¢ â¢ Fifteenth:
Refunding money paid into the State
treasury. â¢ * â¢ Seventeenth: Re
leasing or extinguishing. In whole or
in part, the indebtedness, liability or
obligation' of any corporation or per
son to this State, or to any munici
pal corporation therein." In answer to
the foregoing- provisions of the consti
tution it may be claimed that the act
In question is not local or special legis
lation, and in form it may not be so.
But the framers of the constitution,
and the people who adopted it, did
not hedge about the Legislature with
such restraints In the matter of con
ferring favors, or making gifts or do
nations by special and local legisla
tion, and at the same time leave the
door wide open for similar abuses to
enter under the guise of general legis
lation. By section 22 of the same
article the Legislature is prohibited
from making any grant or donation of
property to any Institution not under
the exclusive management and control
of the State, except institutions con
ducted for the care and support of
orphans and half-orphans, and aged
inalgent persons, and In such except) â !
cases reserving to the. State the right
Of visitation. By section 31 of said
article it Is declared, among other re
strictions Imposed upon the Legisla
ture: "Nor shall It have power to
make any gift, or authorize the mak
ing of any gift, of any public money
or thing of value to any Individual,
municipal or other corporation what
ever; provided, that nothing In this
section shall prevent the Legislature
granting aid pursuant to section 22 of
this article."
in answer to the contention on the
p*rt of the respondent that by the
amendatory act at 1597 it Is attempted
to give or donate public money or
thing of value, appellant's counsel
snys: "That the State never had pos
eession of any part of the 'accumula
r acquiEltiona' of Leland Stan
ford, deceased; â¢ â¢ â¢ an( 3 ne (re
npondent) has not shown how the
State could give away what it never
had." In other words, it is claimed
that one not in the possession of prop
erty Is not the owner of It. The law
of ISO 3 repeatedly declares that the
portion coming to the State ".shall be
due and payable at the death of the
decedent. And it Is further provided
that from that time until paid over in
the cdurse of administration the sum
no due the State Bhall bear Interest,
and interest shall be paid on the sum
so due the State.
It would be absurd to exact Interest
for the detention or use of money or
property not belonging to the party
who demands It. It is elementary law
that the right of Inheritance, Includ
ing the designation of heirs, and the
portions which the several heirs shall
receive, as well as the right of testa
mentary disposition, are entirely mat
ters nf statutory enactment, and with
in the control of the Legislature. It
is only by virtue of the statute that an
heir Is entitled to receive any of hla
ancestor's estate; and the Legislature
can provide that the whole or only

Mrs. Mills and Mr. Watson were mar

neither having passed 20, and although
endowed with wealth and all else that
should bring happiness, in three and a

a portion shall go to the heirs or other
beneficiaries upon the death of tho
ancestor. This being so, and the Leg
islature In this case having determined
that 05 per cent of the decedent's es
tate may go to his heirs and benefi
ciaries, and that r> per cent be retained
to the State, it is too clear for argu
ment that this 5 per cent vested In tho
State at the same time that the tto per
ii n1 vested In the hfiirs or other bene
ficiaries. "An estate Is vested when
then- is an immediate right of present
nient, or a present fixed right of
future enjoyment." (Fourth Kent's
Com., 2^2.) The State r here, from the
death of the decedent, had a present
fixed right of future enjoyment to the
f. per cent of his estate. This is prop
erty or a thing of value belonging to
the' State.
The following from the Civil Code
in merely reciting the common law:
"The ownership of a thing Is the right
of one or more persons to possess and
use it to the exclusion of others. In
this code the thing ofwhlch there may
be ownership Is called property." (Sec.
654.) "There may be ownership of all
inanimate things which are ctpable of
appropriation or of manual delivery,
of all domestic animals, of all obliga
tions; of such products of labor or
skill, as the. composition of an author,
good will of a business, trademarks
and signs, and of rights created or
granted by statute." (Sec. C 55.) It Is,
therefore, not the possession alone,
but the right to possess, that consti
tutes the ownership; and ownership
may be "of rights created or granted
by "statute," as the case here. It would
be altogether a new definition In the
law to hold that one who had not ob
tained possession of a thing or had
parted with its possession could not be
the owner of such thing. This would
be contrary to the teachings of ele
mentary law, which recognizes a right
in action as well as a right in posses
sion This rule contended for would
make ownership depend altogether
upon strength and agility in obtaining
and holding possession of things.
The purpose of the act of 1897, as ap
pears by its title, was merely to amend
the act of 1593. Section 1 of the latter
act amends section 1 of the act of 1893
by re-enacting said section at length,
as required by the constitution. There
after is added to the act of 1897 the in
dependent section 2, which attempts to
each other's existence, the couple met by
chance at Haywards, where Mr. and Mrs.
Mills and children were stopping. Years
had brought about many changes in the
personal appearance of the couple, and
neither recognized the other. At the din
ner table they were introduced by parties
who little suspected their former rela
tions, and who were astounded when -Mr.
! Watson abruptly left the room. He con-
J trlved, however, to meet his children, and
! to them he disclosed his identity. He ere
! ated a deep impression upon them, one of
I the results of which was the complete re
conciliation of the couple, the crowning
act of which will be their wedding this
month.
Sickness forced Mr. Mills to go to Flor
| Ida. The separation from the former wife
â¢ of Mr. Watson was made complete by a
divorce. The hand of death claimed the
j second Mrs. Watson. While both were
I thus freed from marriage ties fate kept
I them apart until aboVit a year and a half
j ago. At that time Mr. Watson was pre
â¢ paring to leave the State, never to return.
By chance he met his son, and learning
| that his first wife was free pleaded for an
\ Interview. The boy had no difficulty in
I arranging the reunion. The couple that
j had been separated for close on to a quar
ter of a century found that the first love
\ had outlived all the assaults that a cruel
fate had made upon it. The smoldering
! spark fanned itself into life and glowed
1 with greater fervor than it had when the
j love of the couple was young.
The wedding will be attended only by
the members of the Watson and Mills
families, and among these will be the six
grandchildren of the contracting parties.
release the payment of the taxes Im
posed by the act of 1593, except such as
have already been paid over to the
Treasurer of the proper county.
Passing consideration of the ques
tion whether this section is not In
valid because not embraced In the
title of the act, and for the further
reason that It. in effect, amends other
sections of the act of 1893 without re
enacting them, it would strike the or
dinary mind as a strange piece of leg
islation. The one who has been prompt
In complying with the law and paid
into the county treasury what belongs
to the State is punlshe"d for his good,
conduct by retaining the money so
paid, whereas he who has refused to
obey the law is rewarded by giving or
releasing to him that which belongs to
the State and which he unjustly with
held.
The object of this unjust discrimina
tion is apparent. To take public funds
from the treasury and give them away
would be a more bald and palpable
violation of the constitution than to
arrest such funds in transit and return
them or give them away. The latter,
however, is only an Indirect mode of
accomplishing the same result; but in
law that which cannot be done directly
may not be done indirectly. The funds
in question here were never In the
possession of the appellants, but in the
possession of the administratrix of the
estate, as an agent under the law to
hand them over to the State as the
owner thereof.
It is said, however, on behalf of ap
pellants that the Legislature may not
only amend, but repeal the law alto
gether, in which case there would be
no means of obtaining possession of
the sums due the State not already
turned over. The Legislature might,
perhaps, abolish or repeal all laws for
the collection of debts; this, however,
would not have the effect of paying or
discharging the debts, or in the least
Impair the obligation to pay them.
Property rights and obligations would
remain as before. These, by funda
mental law, are placed beyond the
reach of legislative interference.
In substance, if not in form, to turn
over the fund in question belonging to
the State to the appellants would be
to make a gift or donation of the same,
and the law regards substance rather
than form.
We are therefore of the opinion that
BRAVES OF THE
IROQUOIS IN A
SULLEN MOOD
Resent Such Flings as
"Old Squaw."
WANT WESLEY REED'S SCALP
THE TOMAHAWK IS NO MATCH
FOR McNAB'S TONGUE.
The Republican Dark Horse for
Mayor May Be Trotted Out at
This Morning's
Session.
The Iroquois braves are in a sullen
mood. They have a grievance against
Gavin McNab, holding that he is respon
sible for the many lllngs against them.
It is indeed humiliating to an Iroquois
warrior to be called an "old squaw." The
braves assert that McNab, the big medi
cine man of the rival tribe, whose lodge
is pitched in the Mills building, is bent
on provoking a spirit of hostility in the
Democratic convention toward members
of the Iroquois Club.
The Iroquois braves are for peace and
patronage, although they do not admit
that the organization to which they be~
long is a peace club, or a spoils hunting
aggregation of warriors. The braves in
many a hard-fought battle have carried
the Democratic banner to victory. Suc
cess has ftot always attended their forays.
The Iroquois of old Knew defeat on the
banks of the St. Lawrence, but they kept
on fighting until the tribes were deci
maU'd and scattered. The modern Demo
cratic Iroquois have suffered political re
verses in their pursuit of patronage and
plunder, but the disasters have not damp
ened their ardor.
The present trouble on the Iroquois
mindâ the grief that weighs heavily on the
Iroquois heartâ springs from the aspira
tion of Wesley Reed to be the nominee of
the Democratic convention for District
Attorney. To the council of the Iroquois
Reed is neither a stranger nor a welcome
visitor. In the lodge of Gavin McNab
there is a ready pipe of friendship for
Reed. McNab is so earnest and enthusi
astic in his aamiration for Reed that he
resents the slights of the Iroquois. His
attitude seems to say: "If you are hos
tile to Reed you are hostile to me,"
Among the Iroquois are many friends of
the chieftain in the Mills building, and
they do not desire that their aversion to
Reed shall be construed as a menace to
McNab. They refer to the record to show
that Reed was opposed a year ago by
such Iroquois braves and champions of
to give retroactive effect to the act of
1897 would conflict with the provisions
of the constitution prohibiting the
Legislature from making any gift or
donation of any public money or thing
of value.
The amendatory act of 1890 (Stats.
1899, p. 101), passed after the rehearing
was granted herein, has no application
in this case. By Its terms it applies
only to such property as has passed
since the first amendatory act.
We quite agree with appellants'
counsel that " an heir or legatee must
take his estate on such conditions as
at the time the State may have im
posed," and that subsequent legisla
tion could not affect such vested right.
And this rule, as already held ap
plies equally to the State, whose right
to the fund in question accrued under
the act of 1593.

This Week's Wasp.
This -week's Wasp is an especially
brilliant number. The cartoon upon the
Dreyfus verdict, illustrating the nausea
which it has caused in Europe and
America, is particularly striking and
appropriate. Senator Mulrooney's let
ter concerning the political situation in
Sar. Francisco would upset the gravity
of a Sphinx. The half-tone portraits of
the First South Dakota officers and the
Illustrations of the scenes attendant
upon the return of the Minnesota and
Dakota volunteers excel in beauty and
artistic finish anything of the kind pub
lished In San Francisco. Cynical, sati
rical and humorous tales, storiettes
and poems; biting and analytical mu
sical and dramatic criticisms, and ex
haustive comment upon the doings of
the business world, complete an issue
that certainly sustains the reputation
of the Wasp as being the leading
weekly of the Pacific Coast.

and only mentions the controversy be
cause the Iroquois are threatening to
tomahawk McNab If, he does not stop
calling them "old squaws" and "pie hunt
ers" as punishment for their opposition
to Mr. Reed's ambition. As a neutral
observer of the right The Call is surely
not transcending the privileges of a non
combatant by observing the weapons
used This observation leads to the judg
ment that the McNab tongue is a more
effective weapon in a close tight luan
the Iroquois tomahawk. The Scotch edge
I of the McNab weapon inflicts a laceration
j that only time and political pie can heal.
There is trouble in the inner circle of
the Citizens 1 Republican League over the
announcement in yesterday's Call that
the Saturday forenoon conference of the
executive committee and party leaders
would take place at headquarters in the
Grand Hotel. The Call stated that the
conference would take place at 9 a. m.,
to suit the convenience of Henry T. Scott
and others, but did not assert that Henry
I T Scott's office had been designated as
! the meeting" place. According to authentic
and verilied intelligence received yester
day the members of the executive com
mittee will assemble this morning at 9
o'clock at Henry T. Scott's office. The
office of the Union Iron Works happens
to be there, but the "works" are not in
politics and will have nothing to do with
the executive conference.
Delegates to the Republican Convention
surmise that the long concealed dark

trotted out for parade and review at the
early conference this morning.
WAR DECLARED.
Democrats Resolved to Knife
All Aspirants lor Local Offices
Who Opposed Bryan.
National party. lines are to be drawn
in the contest for municipal power La*t
night the Democrats took the initiative
through the formidable party organiza
tion known as the Iroquois Club SIS
hundred braves assembled at tne wit,
warn in Pvthlan- Castle and resolved with
a wlrwhoop to fight to the death every
aspirant to? office who did not support
Hr\"i.n for President in lb'Jb.
The proclamation declaring war on the
Gold Democrats created prolonged and
earnest discussion. The resolution was ,
prepared by a committee consisting of ,
MaFor Lewis, Max Popper, J. H. Dignan
and Fred A. Baldwin. It was Introduced
by Major Miles and adopted without
amendment. Here is the declaration:
Whpreasâ supporters of the Chicago plat
fora? Md of the Democratic Presidential ticket
of 1596 in many instances made sacrifice of
cront for principle, and those who abandoned
the party at that time and opposed Its Presi
dential ticket sacrificed principle for profit.
Therefore, be It the nomination by the Demo-
Resolvedâ That the nomination by the Demo
cratic municipal convention of San Francisco
of any one who did not remain loyal to the
party and its Presidential ticket at that crucial
period of history will tend to the destruction
of party organization and endanger the future
success of the party, locally and generally.
The Iroquois braves have a following of
seventy members in the Democratic local
convention. It is believed that the braves
will stand by the declaration of the coun
cil and tomahawk every office-seeker that
deserted the Democratic party in, 1896.
The cry was raised last night that Bryan
would have been elected President had
it not been for the treachery of Gold
Democrats.
After the council of war last night the
aggressive Iro<iuois asserted that Gavin
McNab's friend. Wesley Reed, would be
their first victim. Word went out that L.
F. Bylngton had openly proclaimed him
self as a candidate for District Attorney.
It was predicted that Gavin McNab would
be compelled to loosen the reins on the
Democratic convention.
Mayor Phelan's friends are alarmed at
the attitude of the Iroquois. The Mayor
hoped to keep the national issues out of
the local light and thereby lure a few
thousand Republicans into the Democrat
ic camp. The Democrats having decided
to open the national campaign in the local
election, the Republicans will accept the
challenge.
