Heavy Guns Hurl Forty-Pound Shells Into
Surrounded Ladysmith.
British Naval Guns Again Brought Into Play by
General White's Garrison to Resist the
Stubborn Attack of the Burghers.
TJI STCOURT, Natal, Nov. 9.â Heavy firing is now proceeding
Hi in the direction of Ladysmith. It began about daybreak.
Some reports are so much heavier than any previously
heard as to lead to a general beiief that the Brtish heavy naval
guns are again active.
The safe arrival at Ladysmith of Lieutenant Hooper of
the Fifth Lancers shows that communication with the garrison
is possible. He was anxious to rejoin his regiment and started
hence, accompanied by a Nata! policeman. They succeeded in
traversing the Boer lines.
A party which rode out several miles about noon to observe
the bombardment of Ladysmith could see a Long Tom, a forty
pounder, posted on the railway side of the Bulwara. firing at
intervals of six to eight minutes. Another gun was observed in
operation a little distance away. Puffs of smoke were dis
cernible on the opposite side, showing that Ladysmith was
standing a big bombardment. The locality of the town was
nothing but ft a huge caldron of smoke.

proved that the acquisition of artillery,
which ha? destroyed the former mobility

rumored that they are In straits for food

AT ORANGE RIVER
LONDON, Nov. 13.â The War Office this
morning has the following: dispatch from
Cape Town, November 12 (noon):
"Colonel Gough at Orange River reports
that during a reconnoissance of fifteen
milts to a point nine miles west of Bel
mont on November 10 the officers of the
patrol first came on a Boer position taken
upon a great semi-circle ridge, standing
out Into a plateau. They endeavored to
make the Boers develop their strength by
demonstrating with two squadrons of the
Ninth Lancers and a field battery on the
left wing, with one and a half companies
of mounted infantry on the right wing
and with artillery in the middle of the
plateau out of the infantry fire.
"Joe enemy began by firing at our cay
airy from a gun at the north end. As
the cavalry, in open order, began to circle
around them the hills seemed full of
sharpshooters. The mounted infantry en
deavored to outflank the enemy's left, in
order to discover the laager, coming un
der a heavy and unexpected fire from a
few skirmishers.
"Our guns fired several apparently ef
fective shots, but the enemy did not re
spond, having withdrawn with the wound
ed. The enemy did not fire on the am
bulance. Colonel Gough withdrew his
force after a demonstration lasting three
hours and returned to camp the same af

ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN BOERS
AND BRITONS AT KIMBERLEY
CAPE TOWN. Nov. 12.â The following telegram, undated, has been received from Klmberley by dlspa-tch rider via
Hopetown, November 4 (morning):
"In yesterday's fight the Boers made their appearance near Carters Farm. The British opened fire with a
.laxim. the enemy replying with rifles. By mistake our fir.' went down into the valley, killing a member of
thi Cap* police and wounding another. The British finally retired on the reservoir, where two guns were
brought up to shell the Boers. The result is not yet known.
Meanwhile some Boers had occupied Hampers Dam, firing with one gun on Ottos kopje, but not getting the range
they did no damage. It is believed six Boers were killed in the first fight.
"The Boers now surround Kimberley in great numbers and are bent on 'lifting' cattle and harassing the British.
"Now alarm signals were sounded at 10 o'clock this morning, the enemy having be^n sighted In groat numbers
and close to OUT outposts. They fired on a patrol under Major Peakman, which engaged them, but the firing was at
long range. The only casualty was the wounding of Major Ayleff of the Cape police.
"The enemy 'lifted' forty cattle northeast of the Sanitarium, subsequently tiring eight shells in the neighbor
hood of Fesmeada Farm at Keniiworth. They did no damage and retired. Later they fired on a number of convicts
who were working near the Sanitarium, and eventually went off with a. large number of cattle and donkeys.
"The Boers are well mounted and from the dips in the veldt they appear and disappear with marvelous rapidity,
bent on 'lifting' cattle. The demonstration made to the southwest to-day was only a feint to cover the unsuccessful
movement at Keniiworth after cattle. Their field gun shooting was poor, all the shells falling short."
LONDON, Nov. 12.â The War Office issued the following dispatch this evening from General Sir Redvers Euller,
dated Cape Town. November 11. 10:40 p. m.:
"Colonel Kekewich, British commander at Kimberley, reports that the enemy were very active on November 4,
principally with the object of driving off cattle. The Orange Free State troops retired rapidly before Colojiel Turner
without firing.
"At 12:30 p. m. the Transvaal troops advanced on Keniiworth. Major Peakman with a squadron of the Kimberley
Light Horse was hiding in the bush and gave the enemy a warm reception. The Boers retired, firing. Colonel Turner
reinforced Major Peakman, and at 12:40 p. m. the enemy opened fire with one piece of artillery at nearly 4000 yards
''Two guns of the Diamond Field Artillery were then sent in support of Colonel Turner, but the. enemy's guns
had ceased firing after the fifth round. Consequently our guns did not come into action. The enemy's artillery lire
was not damaging and their shooting was bad.
"Our casualties were limited to Major Ayleff of the Cape police, who was wounded in tbe neck. He is expected
to recover. Later in the day, our pickets say, the Boers carried off six dead from one spot, probably killed by our
Maxim. The total Boer loss was probably heavy, but had not been estimated by Colonel Kekewich.
"At 5:30 p. m. Colonel Turner was again in contact with a new body of the enemy on the Sehnest Drift ronrl.
From the conning tower a large number could be plainly seen about two miles to the north of the Kimberley reser
voir and others held a walled inclosure on the right flank. Colonel Turner opened fire with a Maxim and two guns
of the Diamond Field Artillery sent in support. He came into action at 5:47 p. m. and continued firing until dusk.
"Our further casualties there were Private Lubbe of the Cape police, who was shot through the bead and who
died on arriving at the hospital, and Segeant Watermage of the Kimberley division of the Cape police, who was wound
ed but is doing well.
"Colonel Kekewich is unable to stato the enemy's loss; but believes it must have be.->n severe, judging from the
precipitate retreat of the Boers. At 6:10 p. m. the enemy opened fire with one piece of artillery fn>m Camperdam on
Ottos kopje, the latter being held by the Cape police. The enemy inflicted no damage."

NEW YORK, Nov. 12.â The Journal's
Washington correspondent says: This

actual friendship felt by Great Britain
for the United States. Lord Pauncefote
intends to press for settlement the
Alaskan boundary question by arbitra

sistence lies In the fact that Great Britain
stands behind Canada's demand for a ces
sion of Pyramid Harbor or some other
American tidewater port to Canada.
The amiability of the American-British
"understanding" is not in a superlative
degree just now, and the State Depart
ment, if it expressed its sentiments,
would declare our English cousin is act
ing in a manner so singular that it can
not be described as wholly ingenuous.

There Is No Fire Department in the
City, but the Citizens Organ
ized Hastily and Fought
- . the Flames.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CRESCENT CITY, Nov. 12.â The most
disastrous fire which has occurred at
Crescent City .for many years originated
last night in the concrete State building
on the corner of Second and 1 streets. The
property belongs to Mrs. Elizabeth Stel
zer. How the fire originated is yet a
question of mere conjecture, but as no
iv. i tunable ground can be assigned for ac
cidental theory It is supposed to have
been the work of an incendiary.
The tire rapidly spread to other build
ings, and for a time it seemed as if the
whole city were doomed. But by the fa
voring changes of the wind perhaps more
thaji any other reason the devouring ele
ment was stopped, after having swept
about one-fourth of the block in tne busi
ness center of the town, including the
store and residence of Mrs. Stelzer, the
drug store of Mrs. Z. A. Chaceneau, the
variety store of H. S. Hughes and thÂ«
jewelry store of T. Eausino. The toUri
loss is at least $10,000.
When discovered the fire had made euch
rapid progress that it was impossible to
remove some $2000 worth of stock in the
Btcres. Attention was at once directed to
the saving of goods aJid furnkure from
the endangered building, causing the
streets ana sidewalks to be blockaded
with all manner of wares. The electric
lights w>>re extinguished by reason of the
danger from falling wires, but the town
\va.- never before so brilliantly lighted.
Without any organized fire department
it was virtually a hand to hand combat
with the Itamej, in which every citizen
willingly joined, and by dint of faithful
wmk and good luck the flames were kept
from crossing the street.
The building in which the fire started
was Insured tor $6000 in the London and
Lancashire Insurance Company. The in
surance all told on the other buildings
amounts to $1500.

ST. JOHN'S. N. 8., Nov. 12.â A murder

died in the Bhlp's boat which had put off

men left on board, had gotten the schoon

MANUFACTURERS WILL
FIGHT TRADES UNIONS
Four Hundred Sheet-Metal Work
ers Locked Out in Chicago as
the Initial Step.
CHICAGO, Nov. 12.â T0 break up the present trades unions, to stamp out
completely the arbitrary power of walking delegates, is the plan of cam
paign of Chicago contractors and architects. Not until the unions are brok
en up and a new co-operative association of employers and worfcingmen has
been formed will the contest cease, it is asserted.
The first active step In the campaign to deStroy the existing unions was
taken when fourteen manufacturers of sheet metal locked out from their fac
tories over 400 employes. This action, it is expected, will be followed by other
manufacturers of the same commodity, it being avowed openly that the man
ufacturers wish to break up the union.
The manufacturers claim that they have made the move in support of the
Sykes Steel Roofing Company, a member of the association which ordered a
lockout, the union having demanded that the company pay six tinners for
time lost on account of their having struck on one of the company's jobs.
SLOW RECOUNT
IN KENTUCKY
Returns Thus Far Favor
Taylor.
Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 12.â The sec
ond week of uncertainty regarding the
result of the halloting for Governor of
Kentucky begins with little prospect of
immediate relief. The official count has
been In progress two days and official re
turns from a large majority of the 119
counties have narrowed the contest down
to a close finish. Each side claims the
election of its ticket, but the estimated
pluralities of either does not exceed 3000.
While the returns so far received favor
Taylor, the result of the count may hinge
on the decision given by the County Elec
tion Commissioners In several places
where contests have been begun on the
ground of alleged irregularities.
One of these contests, that in Nelson
County, has been decided adversely to the
Republicans. It involves 1198 votesâ
nearly as many as either side claims as
its plurality.
The Democrats will contest the votes
of some of the mountain counties, which
return large Republican pluralities. The
most important county Involved is Knox,
which pave Taylor 1398 plurality. There
are also contests in three precincts in
Louisville, which went Republican.
In any event it is difficult to see how a
hitter contest before the Legislature and
the courts can be avoided. All the con
tests now being considered by the county
election officers will have to be argued
before the State Board of Commissioners,
which must meet at Frankfort within a
month. Both sides are preparing for this
with all the l<>gal talent at their com
mand. Meanwhile, everything hangs on
the official count, which will, consume a
large portion of the week. In Jefferson
County (Louisville) the work is especially
slow. Only one ward has been completed
in the two days' work.
The Commercial to-morrow will print a
statement from Chairman Long of the
Republican State campaign committee
claiming a plurality of 3UI for Taylor.
These figures are based on the official re
turns of 110 county election boards, upon
returns slgni-i] by the precinct election of
ficers in eight counties* more counties In
which the county boards have not fur
nished tabulation and upon returns in one
county in which the election officers re
fuse to certify to the returns.
The 110 counties giving official returns
show pluralities of 27,121 for Taylor and
29.80.T for Oocbel, a nPt plurality of 2154 for
OoebeL In the eight counties not yet can
vassed pluralities are shown amounting to
6424 for Taylor and 1833 for Goebel. The
committee claims that these returns have
been certified to by the precinct election
officers and need only to be tabulated. In
the remaining county, Lewis, there Is a
plurality of 704 for Taylor, but the elec
tion officers boldly refuse to obey the law
by certifying to their returns.
The Courier-Journal will print a state
ment from Mr. Goebel at Frankfort de
claring there is no doubt of his election,
but gives no figures, the announcement
being made that no returns have, been re
ceived since last night, when Goebel s
plurality was figured at 155. '

struction at Clyde Bank to complete the
vessel as speedily as possible. The new
ship, which will be one of the largest i
afloat, is to be finished by January 1. 1800.

The Shanghai correspondent of the

"An uneasy feeling regarding the rela- i
tions of Russia and Japan is spreading
here. There is no doubt that Japan is
practically allied with China, despite the.
degradation which the Empress Dowager
inflicted upon the Chinese envoys to
Japan upon their recent return. This
was merely a tactical move, with a view
of appeasing Russia.
"A large Russian fleet Intends wintering

BUT FAIL TO GET AGUINALDO
Enter the Filipino Capital Without a Conflict,
Only to Find That the Dictator and His
Army Have Made Their Escape.
AA ANILA. Nov. 13 (8:25 A. M. ..âColonel Bell's regiment and a srrjall
force of cavalry entered Tarlac last night without opposition.
Whither AguiQaldo witt) his army and the so-cailed government have
fled is a mystery.
When Colonel Bell left Capas. â â --- miles from Tarlac, he Intended merely to reeonnoiter. He had -with him the Thirty-
Eixth Infantry. Slaven's Scouts. Troop E. Fourth Cavalry, a battalion of the Twenty-second Regiment an.l Gatling puns.
The scouts, mounted, preceded the main body up the railroad. They met a. hundred rebels at Murcla. but the Insurgents
quickly retreated. The scouts found the depot burning, but extinguished the 111 and saved the building.
Th? main column marched upon the wagon road, but before reaching Tarlac divided, entering the town on two sides
at 3 o'clock, -without a shot being fired- ThÂ« insurgents had evacuated the place only a few hours before, Betting fire to
the railway station and rolling stock. They left a rear euard of -â  men, who. however, failed to make a stand and cover
the retreat of the main force of insurgents, as they had probably been ordered to do.
The rebel ordnance is reported to have been shipped to the town of ODor:
The Americans are continuing their advance so rapidly that the insurgents have not the time necessary to destroy
the railroad.
General Mar Arthur book Bamban yesterday. This Is supposed to be the strongest position held by the Filipinos, except
Tarlac- The brief accounts of the engagement received indicate that the rebels fought according to their recent tactics, re
treating after f.rinsr a few volleys. One officer of the Thirty-sixth Regiment was the only American reported killed. Gen
eral Mac Arthur began his advance at daylight: Colonel Smith with the Seventeenth Regiment on the right. Major Bell's
command ar.d the Thirty-sixth on the left, and the Ninth in the center. Colonel Smith encountered a small force at 6
o'clock, easily dispersing the rebels.

TEONG'S MURDER
IS TO BE AVENGED
Cause of Assault on Lee
Ah Ling.
S;>eei&: :-=:<â  to The Call.
POINT SAN* PEDRO, Nor. 12.5-When I
the news reached here to-day that L** :
Ah Lir.g had t-een attacked by highblnd
era la a led grins -house, a * x - e corner of ;
Rcss aliey and Washington street, San .
Francisco, the excitement among the 5.0
Chinese at the fishing camp was inter.se.
The attempted murder of Ling is regarded
here as the beginning of a carnival of
bloodshed^ ar.d now that the first blow
has been struck it is likely that the war
.... be carried on here as well as
across the bay. Lir.g is a relative of Le-e â 
Lin Ling, the alleged assassin regarded
as responsible for the death of Lee Doo ;
Teong, whose body was found a month I
ago In the bay, near the railway wharf at
Sausallto.
At the inquest held on the remains of â¢;
Teong his partner. Wong Ho. testined
that he had been Ulled by being knockea ;â¢
into the water by the jibboom of a fishing
smack. Accordingly, the jury rendered a
verdict of accidental death. On October
2S two influential members of the N:ng >
Yung Society saw Deputy Coroner Steven
Eden at San Rafael ar.d told him thai
Teong had been killed by Lee L:n Ling
as the result of a quarrel over the merits ;
â of their reaped clans. They further
asserted that Wow Ho. the chief witness,
had gone to San Francisco 'â¢" addressed
a specially called meetir.e of the Ning '
Tongs; telling them of the murder and
begging for vengeance. The informants !
wished' to see District Attorney Mclsaac \
immediately and have Ling arrested, they j
e-rJdentiy believing that such a policy â¢
would prevent bioodsced. Mclsaac was ;
out of town and the Chinese returned â¢
home, declaring that deiay meant blood- \
shed. The attempted assassination of Lee I
Ah Ling, a relative of the alleged mur
derer. proves ccncluriveiy that the war
is on for no other reason than the death
of Lee Doo Teong.
A general feeling cf unrest prevails here
and the See Yup and Sam xnp factions |
are both armed to the* teeth in anticipa- j
tion of trouble. Two compatriots of Ling |
went to San Rafael last night, evidently !
fearing an attack on their lives, and have =
not yet returned.
REWARD OFFERED BY
RELATIVES OF LING
A large meeting of the members of the
family to which Ling belongs was held in
Chinatown in this city last night. Rela
tives and representatives were present
from San Pedro and deliberations con
tinued for several hours. The local Chi- |
nese take much stock in the cau.se of the j
trouble as related In the San Pedro dis- ]
patch and anticipate further difficulties.
After the meeting had adjourned it was i
announced that the family wa.* much in- ;
terested in the apprehension of the hat- ;
chet wielder and would give a reward of*
J3Â«"' to the person who would land the of- j
fender in the hands of justice. The re
ward offered is regarded as a simple fig- â¢
urehead by the local police, who believe
that the agitated reiativr-s will take jus- j
tice In their own hands and wreak their j
own vengeance.
CROWNINSHIELD HAS
MODIFIED HIS REPORT
Eliminates All Minimization of the
Victory of Admiral Dewey
ill Manila Bay.
WASHINGTON, Nov. T2.â The criti
cism of his action in minimizing the vic
tory of Admiral Dewey at Manila in his
ar.r.uai report has caused Rear Admiral
Crowr.lr.shleld, Chief of the Bureau of
Navigation, to make some changes, and
when h!s report is issued the objection*]
features will be found to have been so
altered 'hat its stir.g is Â«one.
Crowclnshleld has been charged by
friends cf Rear Admiral Schley witc be
ir.gr so partisan to Rear Admiral Samp
son that he has gone out of hi 9 way to
belittle Â«â â¢-â â â¢â  in order to
exalt his hero in the Santiago campaign.
In any event, the report carefully
omitted any mention of reward Cot
Schiey.
"Every tffort of the department to re
deem this solemn piÂ«dj?e." he stated in
the original proof of his report, "has
been ball Of the cfticers who served
in the North Atlantic waters, three have

these has not so much as the medai

who shared in the victory won in a more I

The alteration will. frirr.ds of Rear

THE SAX FRAXCTSCO CALL. MONDAY, NOVEMBER 13. 1899.
NAVAL RESERVE
FOR THE NATION
Suggestion of Assistant
Secretary Allen.
.'---â¢-â  The Call.
"WASHINGTON". Nov. 12.â The leading
feature of the annual report of Assistant
Secretary Alien to Secretary Long, rela
tive to the naval militia, is his strong in
dorsement of the plan for the organiza
tion of a national naval reserve. He
points out that the experience of the past
year has suggested Certain changes to the
original plan for this organization as con
tained in the bill submitted to the last
session of Congress and he therefore
urges that it be again pushed, with the
amendments prepared by Lieutenant Com
mander W. H. Southerland. who was, for
a part, of the year, in direct charge of
the naval militia bureau of the Navy De
partment. In substance that (Beer says
that as the rversor.ne! act has made tne
term of service of enlisted men in the
navy four years, the same periods should
be Uxed for the enrollment in the naval
reserve, and the reserve officer should
be promoted in war time with the regular
officer with whom he holds the same date
of commission. It is also recommended
that steps be taken for the organization
of a permanent Ist signal system from
the retired list of the navy and the em
ployes of the lighthouse and saving ser
vice. There are several thousand of these
men, and with a small appropriation and
an annual drill tor a few days each year
they would be competent, the report says,
to take up their tries immediately upon
the outbreak of war. With a retired
naval crScer in charge of each lighthouse
district, and an officer in charge at the
Navy Department and the necessary
paraphernalia at the nearest navy-yard
ready for use. this necessary adjunct of
war could be put In working order In
twenty-four hours
During the past year the Legislature of
Maine passed an act for the establish
ment of a naval militia, as did the State
of Minnesota.- The department undertook
to afford the naval militia of the country
an opportunity to drill at sea under ser
vice conditions, and the offer was oc
cepted by the Governors of all but one of
the States having militia organizations.
The report states in detail the result of
the cruises in each case, setting out the
reports of the naval Beers who acted as
inspectors and noting their criticisms
without reserve.

EASTERN BANK HOLDINGS
BELOW THE LIMIT
Apparent Stringency Due to the Fact
That Returns From the West
on Crops Are Late.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12.â Treasury of
fic:asÂ« expect that within a short time the
money drawn from the financial institu
tions of the East for the movement of
crop* and other purposes . â . the West â *:..
begin to find its way to New York, and
that the apparent stringency in money
will be accordingly relaxed. This return.
which this year, they say. appears to be
seine-treat later ttum usual, will be
brought about by the payment <:: the
debts contracted d>- bus;: men in the
\\ e=t whose notes either already nave
matured or are closely approaching ma
turtty Meantime the authorities here de
c'are that no exigency exists for any re
lief measures on the part of the Govern
ment, and" pending an exigency no action
in that direction is contemplated. A lead-
Ing official of the Treasury Department,
speaking of the matter to-night, said:
"In our opinion, as soon as the great
amount of money which has been used
In the West begins to return to the banks
in the East money will be easier and mat
ter* will resume their normal condition.
The outlays of the Government are about
equal to ltfl receipts, which shows thai
the department Is not hoarding any great
amount of money. Since the beginning
of the fiscal year the receipts have ex
ceeded the expenditure by about J6.C'Â».O>3.
while during the month of November the
expenditures have exeeded the receipts by
between J3.OXr.OW and $4,CÂ»y>,i'X'. The fact
that the holdings of the New York banks
are - ... below the gal requirement
is not a matter of special signiScar.ee. If
they were that atnount In excess of re
quirements the difference would be only
J5 000 <>'â¢> not a great amount when their
total leeal holdings are approximately
$180,000,000. So you see that the question
is one more of* sentirner.t than anything
eise. Their holdings might be yet reduced
and no harm result, as the matter of hold
ings is one which is fixed by the Comp
troller of the Currency. Had this deficit
appeared before the great demand from
the West for funds took place, then the
question Is one which might have caused
some concern, but all they want if now
applied and the natural result must bÂ»
that this money will soon find its way to
the centers whence it was taken."

manager of the Yellowstone Xatioaal
Park Transportation Company is here se
curing support 'or a bfll which Senator
Carter of Montana will introduce In Con

miles at the southwest corner in Idaho
and 28) miles a: the northwest corner In

TWO DESPERATE ROBBERS
SHOOT A SALOONKEEPER
John.Thomas Will Probably Die for Trying
to Save His Till,
The Murderers Escapeâ Railroad Yards of West
Oakland Patrolled by Police â Six
Arrests Made,
OAKLAND. Nov. 12.â Two desperate
ff Yj robbers, heavily armed and fully
fi masked, broke into the saloon of
\^_^ Baptiste & Thomas, at the corner
of Pacific and Campbell streets,
last night at 11 o'clock. John Thomas.
the Junior member of the firm, refusing
to comply with the order "Hands up."
and showing fight by reaching behind the
bar for his revolver, was shot through

of one oj the murderers entered his left
arm near the shoulder, while a third em

The neighborhood where the saloon of
the luckless victim is situated, though
near the railroad yards In West Oakland,
is quite thickly settled. It is, however,
poorly lighted.
The only other person In the saloon at
the time the robbers entered was Frank
Perry, a young man employed at the Cal
ifornia Door and Sash "Works, an 1 re
siding at 1775 Ninth street. According to
Perry. Thomas wag lust corning around

THEY CATCH FISH.
Dogs of Labrador Trained to Help
Their Masters Make a Living.
Dogs that are trained to .catch fish are
among the ordinary features of every
day .... barren shores of that dis
tant portion of Labrador that belongs to
Newfoundland. The valuable cod fisheries
along the 1100 miles cf Labrador's coast
yield about a fifth of Newfoundland's to
tal catch of cod and furnish employment
annually to thousands of hardy fisher
foik. They fish with lines that are 15>j to
200 fathoms long, two men to a boat, and
each man uses two hand lines. The usual
bait is capflin. When fish are at all plen
tiful it takes these two men but a very
short time to fill a boat with cod.
A number of them have trained their
dogs to assist in catching fish. The
rapidity with which the fishermen haul
up their iong lines when the; feel a fish
robs the latter almost entirely cf life by
the time it reaches the surface of the sea.
It comes to the top as completely ex
hausted as a salmon that has been played
by an angler until he car. "trail"* it with
his hand and so avoid the necessity of
gaffing it. It is one thing, however, to
bring a heavy cod to the surface of the
water and another to get him into the
beat.
Gaffs and landing nets are unknown to
these toilers of the sea. If they can lift
the fish into the boat by the line all is
well. But this is often where they fail.
If the fish Is large and but lightly hooked,
as is very often the case, the hook breaks

The fish, still quite inanimate in manner 1

only for a moment, however. The fisher's !
trained dog. often without even awaiting j
a signal from his master, leaps over the <

sea. swims after the floating fish and j
seizes it in its mouth. Returning con- ]

TIGHT MONEY AND THE GOVERN
MENT.
T feature in Wall street is the relation
of the banks to the comparative clearness of
money, winch bids fair to continue for some
Intie time yet. The financiers say that the law
â  the banks to maintain a castiron reserve under
all circumstances, which prevents them from increas
ing their loans to meet the current expansion of
:id are agitating Congressional action in re
the currency, with the view to ease the situa
tion. It has been suggested that the Government
buy $100,000,000 in bonds, which would immediately
- the circulation to tin- amount, but the Gov
: retorts that whatever stringency exists is not
due to the .vi^e maintenance of the reserves, but to
overspecuiation on the part of the public, and that it
does not intend to pull any speculative chestnuts out
of the Wall street fireâ and there the, matter rests.
There is a good deal of truth on both sides of the
controversy. Both are right to a certain extent. It
is true that the banks are hampered in their loans
by their obligation to maintain their legal reserves,
for any tyro can see that a bank without a sufficient
r< serve is a bubble liable to burst at any moment; and
it is equally plain that the circulation should be so
arranged that it can respond to the demands of trade
whenever occasion requires, else something is apt
to give way. Trade is elastic and expands and con
tracts precisely like the mercury in the thermometer,
and if it encounters a castirnn reserve in periods of
expansion it is unable to find relief where it has the
be-t right to expect it. In the present case the Gov
ernment says that the money market is being artifi
cially manipulated, and indeed it is charged that par
ties are borrowing large amount? at high rates and
then locking up the money, which they do not want
to use themselves, so that nobody else can uÂ«e it.
By this means j.;reat sums are withdrawn from circu
lation and abnormal rates of interest are maintained.
Under these circumstances the Government refuses
to interfere.
Meanwhile trade continues to expand. Wool, cot
ton, pigiron, hides and leather, boots and shoes and
many n.inor commodities are quoted at a further ad
vance, and the end is apparently not yet. If there is
any financial suffering on this account outside of Wall
street it has not yet manifested itself. There were
rumors last week that a New York bank was in
trouble, but the clearances for the week showed a
gain of 36.8 per cent over the same week in iÂ£oÃ and
the failures were only 157, against 211 last year. Of
all the important cities in the country Omaha was
the only one to exhibit a loss in clearings, but this
town has been doing this on and off for months.
Although the New York bank statement for the pre
vious wrrk showed that the averages of the clearing
banks were below the legal limit the stock
market was unruffled and money was comparatively
quiet. There was some liquidation in stocks along in
the middle of the week, but it was supposed to be for
account of those speculators who had become tired
of carrying them in the face of a high money market
and had no bearing on the general prosperity of the
country. At the close of the week, indeed, there was
a moderate rally on the covering of shorts and favor
able reports about the money market, both good
signs of inherent strength. Perhaps the ease with
which the advances in the great staples were main
by the manufacturers had something to do
with this, though there were signs that the enormous
demand for goods, which lias prevailed all over the
country for a year, was becoming satisfied, though
Still more or less behind the production. The tables
have been turned in this respect, for metals, which
for months led all advances, are weakening, while
manufactured goods, such v textile fabrics, which
lagged behind, are now distinguished by great firm
ness and activity. The gross situation, therefore
remains unchanged.
Leading financial and mercantile observers in the
East see nothing to indicate any halt in the country's
prosperity for months tv come. Barring the tight
ness of the money market all conditions point to
farther expansion in trade. Of course it must come
to a halt some time, but the end is not yet in sight.
OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
SOME time ago we directed attention to a state
ment made by Frank L. Ncall of Philadelphia
before the United States Industrial Commis
sion to the effect that the merchant marine of the
United States â steam and sail â of iooo tons gross
register and upward and under twenty years old, fly
ing the American flag and suitable and available for
trans- Atlantic or trans-Pacific trade, does not ex
ceed a total of 300,000 tons gross register.
The statement is so surprising that doubts have
been expressed as to its accuracy, and for the pur
pose of confirming it Mr. Neall has since issued an
elaborate compilation, giving the rig, name, gross
register, place and date of building and port of regis
try of every American steamer or sailing vessel in
cluded in the terms of his statement. From the lists
given it appears the number of United States vessels
suitable and available for oceanic traffic are: 140
steamships, with a gross register of 399,425 tons; 52
ships, aggregating 111,433 tons; 14 barks, with a total
of 18,870 tons and 88 schooners, having a register of
115,101, making a total of 644,829 tons. From that
list, however, as Mr. Neall points out, there must be
deducted as not intended and in reality unsuitable
for the trans-oceanic trade, by reason of having been
constructed for coastwise or near-by commerce, 169
vessels, having an aggregate register of 348,644 tons;
leaving as suitable and available for trans-oceanic
traffic only 125 vessels of a gross register of 296,185
tons.
Between the tonnage of our merchant marine, suit
able and available for trans-oceanic trade, and the for
eign commerce of the country, there is an impressive
contrast. Mr. Xcall says:
"Surprising as the figures given in my testimony
may have appeared, they are indeed an understate
ment of vital facts intimately associated with the con
tinued prosperity of the commercial interests of the
United States. The value of the merchandise* ex
ported by the United States to foreign countries dur
ing the year ending December 31, 1808, was, in round
numbers, $1,200,000,000; the value of our imports of
foreign merchandise during the same period was
roundly stated, $000,000,000, making the sum total of
exports and imports for twelve months upward of
$1,800,000,000, an aggregate movement of merchan
dise of the value of $150,000,000 per month."
The aggregate weight of the exports was 30,000,000
tons, while the imports for the same period approxi- j
mated 7,500.000 tons, making a total of more than
37,000,000 tons dead weight, or over 3,000,000 tons a
month. To undertake to carry on such a traffic with
such a merchant marine aÂ« we now possess is much
the same as if a farmer should attempt to take to
market the produce of a large farm in a wheelbarrow.
What further argument is required to convince in
telligent men that the upbuilding of our merchant
marine is one of the most pressing needs of the
country?
The source of the great American thirst for beer

THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION
ACT IN GREAT BRITAIN.
A CURIOUS law point, which has just been de
cided by a Scotch court in a case arising under
the workmen's compensation act, has had the
effect of reviving interest in the act itself, and accord
ingly the public is receiving a good deal of informa
tion concerning the effects of the law, which has now
been in operation about a year..
The case under discussion is. worth noting as an
illustration of the refinements Scotch Judges can put
upon the technicalities of law. As it comes to us
the story is this: A shipbuilding firm in Glasgow
built the hull of a steam vessel and after she was
launched towed her to a public dock twenty mi'cs
away, near an engine building establishment (having
no connection with the shipbuilders), to be fitted with
engines. While the engines were being installed an
employe of the engine builders met with an accident,
in consequence of which he lost the sight of his right
eye. The question arose whether, under the new law,
the engine builders or the shipbuilders were liable for
damages. After argument and reargument before
the Scottish Court of Appeals it was decided that the
shipbuilders were liable and judgment was given
against them â the injured man being awarded
eighteen shillings a week compensation.
The Judge who gave the decision is reported to
have stated that "the injured workman had never
been directly in the employment of the shipbuilders;
they never paid him any wages and he was not em
ployed upon the vessel while she was in the ship
building yard at all. * * ' * Nevertheless, in ac
cordance with the interpretation put upon this extra
ordinary piece of legislation, I feel myself shut up
to the conclusion that it is the shipbuilders and not
the. engineers who must compensate the man."
An act which compels Judges to such decisions as
that may well be characterized as "an extraordinary
piece of legislation," and it is not surprisng to learn
that in many other respects it has perplexing results.
Some of its effects have been undoubtedly good.
Since they are now responsible for all injuries to
their workingmen the employers of Great Britain
have been more careful in the selection of employes
and more cautious about permitting them to take
risks. That policy, however, has been injurious to
many workingmen, for it is noted that there has been
something like a wholesale discharge from work
shops of men who either by reason of age. deafness,
near sightedness or some defect of body are more
liable to accidents than the average workingman.
The conclusion appears to be that the law is on the
whole a beneficial one, but that it will have to be
amended in some respects to fit it to the complexities
of modern industrial life. At any rate there is cer
tniniy injustice in nn act that leads to such decisions
ns that reported from Glasgow.
BRITISH CAMPAIGN PLANS.
I |~X ISPATCHES from South Africa give such
) meager accounts of the progress of the war
* â it is not possible to form a satisfactory esti
mate of the situation at Ladysmith. Kimberley or
Mnfrking. Enough is known, however, to make it
! sure a critical period has been reached in the cam
â¢ paign and that if the Roers are to accomplish a
| notable success, crushing in its effect upon the Brit
ish before General Ruller arrives with reinforcement-,
for the beleaguered garrisons, they must strike at once
i and strike hard.
Thus far the fortunes of battle have been on the
side of the Transvaal. While they have not capture!
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1899.
either of the objective points of the first dash of the
campaign, nor routed or captured a British army,
they have so completely invested the British as to
force General Buller to change the plan of campaign
announced at the outbreak of the war and hurry his
men to the relief of General White as rapidly as
they arrive in Africa.
It will be remembered that shortly after the open
ing of hostilities a dispatch from London stated that
the troops about to be sent to Africa would not be
landed at Cape Town, nor at Durban, but at Port
Elizabeth, Port Alfred and, East London. While no
authority was given for the. statement, it was in itself
so reasonable it may be regarded as fairly well
founded. It was believed at the time that General
White could easily hold his own, and Buller expected
to be able to land his army corps at the point from
which he could most easily advance on Pretoria,
organize it there and" set forth for the capture of the
Boer capital. That expectation has been disap
pointed. White is so hard pressed that Buller has
had to land his men at Durban and arrange to move
them forward for the relief of Ladysmith at once.
Hmv large a portion of Buller's force will be re
quired for the purpose of checking the advance of
the Boers into Natal cannot be estimated. It is
expected, however, that twenty-three transports with
troops will reach South Africa before the close of
this week. If White manages during that time to
hold his own, it is likely a comparatively small force
sent to his relief would have the effect of enabling
him to open his communications with the coast and
the south and thus be virtually safe. Should that be
so, Buller could then with the major part of his corps
carry out his original intention of using Port Eliza
beth as a ba?e and after resting his troops and
arranging his plan of march set out in December
with a well equipped army for the attack on Pretoria.
Of the advantages of the route from Port Elizabeth
i f has been said that while Durban is nearer to the
seat of war, yet to get from it through Natal into the
Transvaal the British would have to cross the steep
Drakensberg, all the passes of which are in the hands
of the Boers and are strongly guarded. By the other
route the only serious obstacle in the way of advance
is the Orange River, and once beyond that the British
would have open plains across which to advance upon
Bloemfontein and Pretoria.
The time is at hand when the questions involved
in the different plans of campaign will have to be set
tled, and it looks now as if the settlement would not
be left wholly to Buller. The Boers may yet force
his hand and compel him to risk everything at Dur
ban and Ladysmith, instead of making a Christmas
time march of triumph over the plains of Orange
State to the capital of the Transvaal.
WHEN Parliament was summoned to authorize
the British Ministry to call out the reserves of
the army and to vote money to carry on the
war in South Africa the Ministry contented itself with
asking permission to borrow money. Nothing was
said about taxes. Since Parliament adjourned, how
ev< r. there has been a good deal of discussion of the
subject, for it is clear the money must be raised at
some time and somebody will have to pay taxes to
provide it.
There is to be no hurry in meeting the issue. Tli-.-
London News stated the other day, "The first object
of the Government is to make the war popular." That
means, of course, the Government will not add any
thing to the burdens of the British taxpayer during
the war if by borrowing money it can avoid doing so.
The Chancell<w of the Kxchetjuer is reported to have
â  I the possibility of meeting the expense* of
the war out of the ordinary taxation of the year, "ex
ceptionally increased for that purpose," but the sug
gestion seems to have met with little favor. An
other suggestion that the income tax be increased to
one shilling on the pound and that a tax be levied on
beer has been even less commended. Such taxes
would he sure to make the war unpopular and dampen
the ardor for conquest.
In this dilemma some strange means for providing
money to pay oft the debt that is being contracted
I have been put forth. The Westminster Gazette notes
that a good many persons believe the war to be car
ried on not for the benefit of the British people but
for that of the gold and diamond miners of South
Africa and for the Uitlanders in the Transvaal. These
persons maintain that the cost of the war should be
taxed upon the South African beneficiaries. It is
argued that the entire revenue needed to make up
for the expenditure of the struggle should be made a
charge upon the resources of the Transvaal and be
exacted from that country after the conquest.
In commenting upon the proposition the Gazette
says: "Though it may not be wise when we are at
the beginning of a campaign to anticipate any of the
fruits of victory, it is certainly lawful to contemplate
a settlement in which the Uitlanders shall contribute
their fair share to the cost of their emancipation.
But it is not lawful â it would, on the contrary, be
o-trageousâ to regard the Transvaal as rich booty
which the Boers will be called upon to disgorge be
cause they have dared to defend their country. If we
are going to treat them as honorable foes, and to do
ourselves justice as honest people, we need not stop
to discuss these monstrous proposals for making the
Beer pay vicariously for the Uitlander. We may be
quite sure, at all events, that this war and the recon
struction after the war will cost a great deal more
than the ten millions now required. There will be
ample opportunities hereafter for making the Uit
lander pay his share, and the Boer the indemnity
which in all wars, just or unjust, falls on the beaten
party."
The issue is one that will have to be treated se
riously by the Government as soon as Parliament as
sembles. It will not be possible to postpone the is
sue indefinitely for the purpose of making the war
I popular. Somebody will have to pay the cost, and
however earnestly the Ministry may try to impose all
the burden upon the people of South Africa it is cer
tain the British taxpayer in the end will have to put
up the biggest share of it.
The dubious "fusion" victory in Nebraska has
made, it is said, the nomination of William Jennings
Bryan for President absolutely certain. This is one
phase of the recent Republican victory, which gives
to Republicans more reason than any other, perhaps,
for genuine congratulation.
The proposal to secure from American women con
tributions for a British hospital ship has certainly
the dignity of an innovation. It suggests what might
have been done by British women in the Spanish-
American war.
The new medical director at Agnews Asylum is
demonstrating to the dismayed attendants that a
"pull" may work both ways. In this instance it very
clearly pulls out.
It is likely that ex-President Cleveland's duties as
professor at Princeton will preclude the possibility
of the autumnal hunting trips for which he was
famous. The joyful feeling in duckdom can be
imagined.
BRITISH WAR TAXES.
DESERT PROGRESS.
OIL BOOM NOTES.
LIFE IN THE MINES.
MOTHER LODE GROWTH,
Throughout the iength and breadth of
California mining enterprises are multi
plying and going forward with an energy
never equaled in the history of the State
since the early clays of placer mining. The
difference between those days and the
present is that now a mining enterprise
of any sort means the investment of cap
ital, the employment of men and the dls
i trtbution of money for labor and supplies.
Every mining region in the State now
looks up and is glad. Ip north Del Norto
County is shipping copper ore and watch
ing the new development of a number of
promising gold and topper properties.
Humboldt County has caught the oil boom
and is trying to remember how ita oil ex
citement of the sixties felt.
In Siskiyou County a dozen mining dis
tricts are booming with new developments
and the county expects to point to some
big new mines b< fore a great while. Yreka
la looking forward to a boom as a result
j of the rapid growth of the mining indus
i try. According to the Yreka Journal,
"ireka is gradually coming to the front
i as one of Uie richest mining centers on
I the Pacific (..'oast, and is likely V> double
; up in population during the coming year,
i with prospects of showing fully 25u0 pop
j ulation when the census enumerators
commence work next summer."
Near the town a big dredge will soon
be in operation In Yreka Creek, and sev
enteen carloads of machinery and lumber
fur It are now going in. The dredge pro
poses to work two miles of ground. Yreka
also shows the phenomenon of turning a
racetrack into a gold mine. The old track
of ihe Agricultural Society has been sold
for $7000 to a syndicate that will wash It
j away.
Yreka will be the supply center of an
extensive region in which many rich sur
face strikes have recently been made and
in which quite a number of quartz mines
will be opened up during the coming
months. Several big hydraulic proposi
tions are waiting for a water supply.
The Mountain Copper Company has put
its new smelting furnace, No. 5, In opera
tion. It is a third larger than the others.
Five new McDougall furnaces are to bo
erected at once, and the output of this
great mine will be largely Increased dur
ing the coming year. The unwatering of
the Copperopolis mines recently begun,
the erection of smelting plants In Madera
and Fresno counties and the development
or reopening of many comparatively
small copper properties In several coun-
ties now going on, several of which are
now producing in a small way, Increase
the promise of a big stride In California's
copper production during I'M 1 ) and for this
year as well.
Several big deals In the Shasta County
cupper belt are subjects of constant spec
ulation and report. It Is on the develop
ment of some of these vast stores of cop
per that the growth of the State's copper
Industry chiefly depends. When capital
takes hold of one or these evidently groat
properties exploration at depth must pre
tie erection of smelting- plants, and
probably two years would be as short a
time aa production mi a large scale could
be reached In. Captain <!.â  Lamar is se
cretly and vigorously pros] ting Tils
Bully Hill group of mints, and whether or
n<u he erects a smelter near Copper City
wiii depend on the extent of the ore sup
ply found.
The first machinery tn work the rich tel
luride OTes discovered at the head of Cof
fee <'r<ek, Trinity County, will be In
stalled when snow permits in the spring
and the experiment will be of interest.
George L. Carr. who recently bought a
half interest in th.- Yellow Rose of Texas
mine, last week purchased a Huntingtun
mill, concentrator, engine, etc., for the
mine. Selected ore from this and other
rich ledges In that district are now being
shipped at large expense to Selb^'B.
A number of mining properties in Shasta
County have been sold or bonded recently.
One was the Reid mine iv Star Gulch, on
which a six months' option at 1100,000 was
taken by Frederick King and C. C. Colen,
who will devetop the mine by shipping ore
to the Keswlck smelter.
The Central Pacific Company is apply
ing for patents to a great amount of this
big northern mineral region. There has
been tiled in Redding a list of 39,996 ucr>-s.
Of Which arr- in Shasta, 25,611 in Trin
ity and 5800 In Siskiyou County. It is un
derstood that other lists will soon bo filed.
The mineral lands bill sleeps in Congress.
The biggest gold mining operations in
the State are naturally along the mother
lode and in Nevada County. The invest
ment! of capital In new and old mother
lode properties and in development work
and mining plants begun or planned in the
past year aggregate millions of dollars. In
Amador County especially the deeper
mining of old properties is the leading
feature.
The Kennedy Is crowding work on its
new three-compartment vertical shaft, de
signed to tap the vein at 3500 feet, and
which with crosscuts will represent an in
vestment of 6everal hundred thousand
dollars. The shaft is down eight hun
dred feet and is progressing at the rapid
rate of twenty-two feet a week.
The new deep vertical shaft at the Wild
nian-Mahoney is being steadily deepened.
Rapid work Is going on at the Central
Eureka, which Is another striking suc
cess in reopening an abandoned mine and
putting faith in deep values. On the 1500
level the rich vein, said to avprage $100
a ton, la being drifted on both ways, and
the rock milled at the Zella.
E. C. Voorhies. one of the lucky openers
of the great old Gwin, has struck It again
in the Lincoln, on which he has been sink
ing for months. Recently a prospecting
crosscut to the west struck a 12-foot vein
of $10 rock and again the mother lode jus
tifles faith in it. In the South Eureka,
Oneida, Argonaut and other well-known
mines sinking to great depths steadily
proceeds.
The sale of the Morning Star drift mine
on lowa Hill, Placer County, is one of the
interesting recent events of the mining
world. The development of this fam
ous property was due to the sa
gacity and ability of Jacob H.
Neff, who has been Its manager
until now. The Coleman brothers and Mr.
Xofi have owned a majority of the stock.
After a large investment in costly work
ings one of the richest buried channels In
that region was struck and the yield was
almost Fabulous f"r years. For about 20* Â»0
feet the gravel has averaged from $7 50
to $10 per ton, and large dividends have
been paid for years. Its present produc
tion Is about $1000 a day.
But the channel has turned Into the
ground of the Big Dipper company, and
foreseeing a comparatively early suspen
sion of operations the controlling stock
holders sold their ISO 3 shares at $17 a share
to the other company. A dividend of $7 a
share remains in the treasury. There are
2400 shares of stock. With this transaction
Messrs. ("oleman and Neff retire from the
Morning Star. Harold T. Power, manager
of the great Hidden Treasure drift mine
In that company, becomes president and
superintendent.
The Utlca company is making large in
vestments in new hydraulic and com
pressed air plants, and among other
things has closed the Stickle shaft for re
tlmberlng. The old timbers are to be
bunrned for the gold that Is in them.
In Tuolumne County all the mills closed
down during the late dry spell have re
sumed operations and the mining com
munities are happy again. Among the im
portant new enterprises in this county is
the Pauper's Dream mine, which was
bonded several months a^ro to Eastern
people. The company has bought the
mine for $20,000 after development work
which has displayed larjre bodies of good
ore to a depth of 280 feet. The shaft will
be put down to 800 feet. The Mt. Jeffer
son will In a few weeks have a new ten
stamp mill running on the larpe nre sup
plies developed. W. H. McClintock is de
veloping the Goldwin, which gives great
promise, and a new power plant is
planned.
The Mariposa Grant in Mariposa County
is the scene of lively operations by the
n.-w owners, who are openinj; a number of
its mines. It is expected that 500 men will
be at work next spring.
At the Massachusetts Hill mine in Ne
vada County a plant to use petroleum for
fuel Is being installed.
The oil boom increases north and west
of Its storm center In the San Joaquin
Valley. Several capitalists and promot
ers are turning to Contra Costa County,
where two or three wells are already go
ing down Near Suisun in Solano County
they are boring for natural gas as well
as oil. Wells are going down In Colusa
County among others. In Humbnlclt
County nearly r.OOO acres in the Matthole
Valley have been taken up In plncer
claims. There eight loeatera have gen
erally joined in securing joint locations of
160 acres. One combination of people has
thus secured control of 4">40 acred.
From Mono County comes the report |
that oil is to be bored for on the islands j
in Mono Lake. Many locations were filed
last week.
The filing of forty-five oil locations in
Kern County in one day last week illus
trates the present activity in that region.
During the week a tract of 6000 acres with
oil possibilities in it, between Kern River
and Poso Creek, was bought by A. <;.
Newton of Los Angeles, who will begin
boring at once. The reported price was
$112,000.
The Alcatraz Company has abandoned
its well-known Carpenteria and La Patera
asphalt mines in Santa Barbara County
and will concentrate Its energies on its
big deposits in the Sisquoc district in that
county.
When an oil boom is on It is not sur
prising to read the boom announcement
that there is grease on the rope at the
Blank well which is now being drilled.
With that evidence that oil nas been
struck the shares will likely go up.
The general mining situation In South
ern California Is thus described by the
Los Angeles Times: "Reports from the
interior are that the weather this season
has been the most favorable for mining
operations ever experienced in this south
western region. From all camps comes
news of activity, the annual assessment
work is being done, prospects are being
developed, tailings are being profitably
worked over through the agency of the
cyanide and other processes and mines
that have been allowed to remain Idle
through want of the necessary capital to
develop them are again being worked,
with the result that trade in all branches
is being helped thereby. The news Is good
news all along the line."
The Inyo Independent reports the sale
of the Barnes & Anderson mine near Cit
rus, in Inyo County. Some picked sam
ples of ore from this mine sent to Los
Angeles went over JlO.Otxi per ton in gold.
Tlio purchasers of the property are
Messrs. Geraux. Phyler and Stewart, and
the terms of the purchase are that
Harnes and Anderson are enoh to receive
$IK) a month for twelve months, and at
the expiration of that period $60,000. In
the event of failure to comply with these
conditions the mine reverts to the origi
nal owners.
A report from San Diego states that
the 1.-ad mine at Valley Center, owned
by Willhite & Hill, named the Surprise
mine, is developing into a better prop
erty than was at first supposed. Some
San Francisco capitalists have been
looking it over with a view to purchas
ing it.
A Johannesburg correspondent of the
Los Angeles Mining Review writes thus:
"More than twice as much mining is be
ing done this year in the various camps
north of Johannesburg as was being dune
at this time last year. In the Panamint
country and the Argus and Slat" ranges
to the south of It there is hardly a claim
but is being worked, while several of
them are milling ore taken out in devel
opment work. A difficulty that the min
ors in those sections are still laboring un
der is the want of teams to haul their
supplies from this point. The freight
teams hauling to Soarles and camps
north of that are as busy as they can be.
but there are not enough teams to do the
work. The freight house here is always
piled up with stuff; it seems to come in
faster than it can be taken out."
Dennis Searles passed through Rands
burg on his way to the borax works a
few days ago and is actively employed
with a large force of men preparing to
start up the works, says the Randsburg
Minor. There is material enough on hand
to run some months and during the time
the works have been shut down every
thing has been cared for and ke-pt in com
plete order bo that it won't be long until I
the plant will be agui/i In operation.
Regarding oil and other mining fakes
to which California seems no longer a
stranger, the Mining and Scientilic Press I
says: "The great industrial activity that j
now prevails throughout the United 1
States is nowhere more marked than in ,
mining of every class. Not only are the
precious metals bring exploited more gen
erally and more vigorously than ever be
fore, but copper, iron, quicksilver, lead
and zinc mines aro being operated to
their fullest capacity. Oil. also. Is at
tracting attention, particularly in Cali- !
fornia. This widespread activity, taken j
together with the creation of trusts and |
combinations of industrial enterprises, j
large find small, has proven a great 'n- j
centlve to many scheming men to seize j
the passing opportunity and make some- i
thing out of nothing, and. as a result, the
country is flooded with prospectuses of
this or that mine or oil well. Nearly all I
of these alluring pamphlets contain more j
or less extravagant statements, but somo
of them deal in absurdities, and were I
very evidently written by persons wholly I
unfamiliar with either the subject of
mining or of oil boring."
Most of the mines along the mother
lode, especially in Tuolumne County,
which shut down in September owing to
lack of water, have resumed full opera
tion.
The sale of the turquoise mines near
Vanderbilt, San Bernardino County, to a
New York man is reported.
The Mountain Copper Company has or
dered a large supply of roofing slate from
the El Dorado County slate quarry, which
resumed operation some time ago.
The largest oil engine ever built for a
mining hoist has been erected by a San

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
A torpedo boat for the Italian navy has
been launche 1 from the yard of
Sehichom, at Elbing, which is to have
a speed of 36 knots.
The submarine boat Narval was
launched at Cherbourg October 20, her
keel having been laid June 1 last year.
The boat is 106 tons, 111 feet 6 inch, s
in length, 12 feet 2 inches beam and l
speed of 12 knots on the surface, and B
knots when submerged is anticipated. She
Is luted with four torpedo projectors and
will carry two officers and a crew of
nine.
Rear Admiral Betollo, Italy's Minister
"i" Marine, recommends that the navy
needs no larger battle ships than i>i
tons, a size which would make then dis
tinctive â  .lefense vessels. As suit
able ba h ships he .--up.
eight g-inch, eight 6-lnch, twelve 1-
poundrrs and twelve 6-pounderi besides
six torpedo tubes. Their speed should be
knol . with coal sufficient for 9000
to 10,000 knots at a 10-knot speed.
A torpedo cruiser named Agordat was
launched October 12 at Castellamara. The
vessel is 1320 tons, fitted with eight Hlech
yuden boilers and engines of 7600 h
i to gjvo a speed of 23
knots. There is little or no wood used
lln her internal fittings, for which <'.â  I
and aluminum have been substituted. The
battery consists Â«,f fourteen L2-pounders,
two machine guns and two torpedo tubes.
The Agordat is the only vessel of her
type in the Italian navy.

â  also been largely extended in the land
service, and where guns and ammunition
I have to be transported over rough roads

jof the gun. A few comparisons of tha
! relative weights of brown powder,
! as the old charges, and that of cordite,
! now used for ship's guns, will show tha
j gain in using the latter: Thus the old 12
--inch, using "_OS pounds brown powder
I a shell weighing 714 pounds, had a pene->
! trative power of 18.9 inches of iron at
| 2000 yards. The new 12-inch wire-wound
I rifle uses nearly lttf pounds of cordite, a
shell weighing S3'> pounds and will pene
trate 29.4 inches of iron at 2000 yards. Th.j
American 6-inch rifle burns 44 to 47
pounds brown powder, the shell weighs
l<Hi pounds and has no greater penetration
than the British gun of like caliber which
uses a charge of cordite weighing- less
than 15 pounds.
Official data and dimensions of the
I Japanese battle ship Shikishima, recent
j ly built at the Thames Iron Works, are
â  as follows: !-â  feet;
| length on water line, 400 feet, breadth, 75

; litted with twenty-five Belleville boilers
'and twin-screw engines, developing 15.'Â»> i
! horsepower, which gave a speed on her
recent trial of 19.023 knots, exceeding the
contract by over half a knot. The armor,
of Harveyiated nickel steel, extends along
; the water line from stem to stern, 'J
inches thick in wake of central battery,
tapering to 4 inches at the ends. The
belt extends 5 feet 6 inches below a
feel S inches above water lino. From

rlat is 32 inches above the water line
; and 3^ inches thick on the slopes within
the citadel, outside of which it is 2 inches
thick, and the main deck is 1 inch. The
citadel, or central battery, is 250 feet in
length, with 6 inch bulkheads at en. ls,
and subdivided between main and upper
deck by twelve bulkheads. The main
battery of four 12-Inch 40-caliber guns
ui-f- carried in 14-inch barbettes, and four
teen (3-Inch quick-firers are located in
eight water-tight casemates on the main
deck and six casemates <>n the 'upper
deck, all protected by 6-inch armor and
having 2-inch armor backs. The second
ary battery embraces twenty 12-pounders
and twelve 6-pounders, in addition to
which are five torpedo tubes, four above
and one below water. Her normal coal
supply is "00 tons, with a bunker rapac
ity of 2000 tons, and her complement;
will number 741, including an admiral and
thirty-eight other officers. The vessel
was built within two years and is now
passing through a series of exhaustive
trials on the coast of England. She han
turned a circle at full speed in 3 minuter
18 seconds, heeling only rive degrees, and
the British journals have nothing but
praise for what they consider a superior
battle ship to any yet built for tho

MAJOR GENERAL MILES
INSPECTS THE HANCOCK
THE remodeled army transport Hancock was the cen
ter of attraction yesterday on the water front. Fully
6000 people looked over the handsome ship, Major
General Miles being among the number. The general
raid the Hancock a hurried visit last Saturday, but yes
terday, accompanied by Colonel Long, who acted as cice
rone, he Inspected the vessel from stem to stern and then
remarked that it was a pity the Government did not have
some transports like her during the war with Spain.
The Hancock is fitted with a magnificent refrigerat
ing plant, and enough meat can be carried in the cold
storage to feed a regiment for six months. Had the
Hancock and Warren and a few more transports like
them been on the Atlantic Coast during the fighting in
Cuba there would have been no "embalmed beef" scan
dal.
Later In the day Inspector General Breckinridge of
the army also went over the transport, in company with
Captains Barneson and Batchelder, and was very much
pleased with the ship. The arrangements made for
the care of the sick were praised by him, and all In all
he considers there is nothing lacking In the Hancock, and
that she is a credit to her designers and to the men
who executed the plans.
The soldiers' kitchen is a feature of the Hancock.
All the latest appliances # for sanitary cooking are to be
found there, and nothing has been overlooked that
would tend to turn out the food in the very best order.
Then, there is an isolated hospital, dispensary and diet
kitchen. The hospital is covered with a dome skylight,
which can be removed, and there is then room to lower
the patients on a stretcher down into the hospital. In
the dispensary there is everything required by the hos
pital staff, while the diet kitchen Is unique. In it food
ordered specially by the doctors will be cooked, and care
has been taken In the arrangements that the food shall
not be contaminated In any way. All the dishes and
cooking utensils are nickel-plated and all the furnishings
are of the best.
The troop ship Is fuml6hed with an armory, maga
zine and specie tank. In the armory there is room for the
arms of a regiment, while the magazine can carry
enough ammunition to last a regiment a year. The cash

REV. DR. RADER DISCOURSES
ON THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH
Rev. William Rader of the Third Con
gregational Church last night delivered a
highly interesting sermon on "Macbeth,
or the Passion for Power." His text was:
"What doth it profit a man If he gain the
whole world and lose his own soul?"â
Matthew vi:26. In part he said:
The tragedy of Macbeth teaches the re
sults of tho passion for power. Aspiration
is a dpsire for excellence and an ambition
for fame. Macbeth'* ambition contained the
elements of usurpation, strategy and sel
flshnfss, the three qualities which have left
their mark ur"->n the political history of the
world, from Guy Fawkes to Bobs Tweed.
They fired the shots that killed Lincoln and
Garfleld, and exploded the bombs of the
Chicago anarchists.
Macbeth gained his throne but lost the
world of courage, peace and power. He lost
his life, which is not the least trouble of
a great soul. When a man loses his head
the effect of the loss depends upon the en
tire possibilities of his life, A man never
gains anything by selling himself for a
throne that does not belong to him.
Conscience is more valuable than any
throne. The most important thing In the
world Is one's own manhoodâ his own beat
self. God expects a man to save himself
and his world. What Is ambition? It is
a glorious cheat.
CATHOLICS BELIEVE IN THE
RAGING FIRES OF HELL
Rev. J. C. McCourt, C. S. P., preached
last evening to a large congregation in
St. Mary's Church. He chose for his text:
"Suffer both .to grow until the harvest,
and in the time of the harvest I will say
to the reapers gather up first the cockle
and bind It into bundles to burn, but the
wheat gather ye into my barn."â
Matthew xili:3o. In part he said:
To believe in hell, to believe that there Is
a place where men are punished In everlast
ing flames, is old-fashioned and obsolete.
The world has rejected It. Protestants ex
plain it away and make those flames, If
they exist, a mere agreeable warmth. Well.
Catholics know better than that: we know
as an awful fact that God. in His justice,
has a place where men suffer forever, where
the worm dies not. where the fire has no
kindly blaze, as we know it here, but black,
formless monsters hold In horrid embrace
the writhing, struggling souls which are
burned forever but not consumed. Every
sense, every part of the body, receives tor
ment and Its own pang, unceaslnar, unre
mitting, endless. The eyes behold visions of
loathing: the ears hear terrible sounds: the
feelings are racked and tortured. Those
members which have especially sinned on
earth receive punishment becoming their
evil deeds; the false tongue is scarred and
dried; the malignant heart Is withered and
torn, and the feet which have trodden the
paths of sin are 'burned with stinging
flames. Fire, horrible fire. Is everywhere,
burning on and on forever; yet, great and
awful as are the torments of the senses,
they are as nothing with those of the mind.
SERMON ON CHRIST AND
HIS RELATION TO SOCIETY
The Rev. John Hemphlli of Calvary
Presbyterian Church delivered a sermon
last night on "Christ and His Relation to
' Society." He chose as his text: "This
i beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana
of Galilee"â John ii:2, and in part said:
"With divine forethought and intention
Jesus began his public ministry by accept
ing an invitation to a social gathering.
Hnl his precursor, John the Baptist, re
! ceived an invitation to this wedding feast
he would have refused to accept it with
; lofty scorn. But Jesus accepted it. John
shunned society. Jesus sought it to show
his followers how it is entirely compatible
with the claims of the kingdom.
"It is a much easier way to turn your
! back upon society and declaim against its
sins, as John diii, tnan to go into society
I and lift up there the white ensign of holi
' ness as Jesus did. It is a Christ-like Chris-'
I tianity, then, that seeks society for the
purpose of purifying an<l sweetening and
I sanctifying it. The religion of Christ is a
for the troops In fhÂ« Philippines will be carried In the
specie tank. Besides the other arrangements for the
comfort of the troops there ia a crew's galley and a
ship's galley, lavatories and bath rooms finished In
enameled ware, while the officers' quarters are finished
In corresponding style. While she was on the drydock
bilge keels were placed on the Hancock, and now she is
the steadiest transport In the fleet.
The credit of carrying out the changes on thÂ» Han
cock Is due to Supervising Engineer J. H. Mathews of
the transport service, and It is due to his skill and vigi
lance that she Is without a peer. In her class, in the
world- When It was derided to alter the ship a board of
survey was appointed as follows: Colonel Oreenleaf,
then assistant surgeon general; Major Raymond, then
medical inspector of the transport service; Captain John
Barneaon, superintendent, and J. H. Mathews, super
vising engineer of the transport service. Captain Barne
son was master of the Hancock when she was the Arizona
and hla advice was very valuable in the planning of the
ship. To Mr. Mathews, however, belongs all the credit
of turning out a model transport.
The transport Warren went on Hunters Point dry
dock yesterday. Some repairs have to be made to her
steering gear, and it will be ten days before she gets off
the dock. Other work has to be done on the vessel, and
it will be December before she sails for Manila again.
The Pathan and City of Sydney will sail for Manila
to-day with troops, and the lien Mohr and Senator will
get away to-morrow. The Indiana goes in the stream
to-day to coal, and the Flintshire went on the Union Iron
Works drydock yesterday.
General Miles and his family will leave this morning
for the East. They will travel over the southern route,
and the general will stop over at New Orleans for the
purpose of Inspecting defenses along the lower Missis
sippi. After his inspection of the Hancock yesterday
afternoon he went to Oakland as the guest of Colonel
Long and saw all of Alameda County's points of in
terest, making his longest stop at Piedmont Springs. At
the Palace last night he expressed himself as highly de
lighted with his visit in every way. He also said it was
likely there would soon be more big guns mounted for
San Francisco's defenses.
power In the midst of all these, purifying
and Bweetening, as the lump of sugar
sweetens every drop in the cup. Chris
tianity is not religious rapture in the
sanctuary merely. It is the power of a
Christ-like life sweetening every other life
it touches."

FATHER YORKE RESUMES HIS
DUTIES AT THE CATHEDRAL
The Rev. Father P. C. Yorke, after a
year's absence abroad on a much needed
vacation, resumed yesterday his duties in
the diocese. At St. Mary's Cathc-dral In
the morning he celebrated the 9 o'clock
mass, delivering a short a<yrmon on the
Scripture lesson. The remainder of the
day he spent In quiet at his home.
To-morrow evening at 8:30 o'clock a for

Yorke at the California Hotel. .
THE REV, E. A. WOODS ON
THE RESPONSE TO PRAYER
Rev. E. A. Woods, D.D., preached at tho
Young Men's Christian Association Audi
torium last night. His text was: "What
is the Almighty that we should serve him,
and what prottt should we have if we pray
unto him?"â Job xil:ls. He spoke in part
as follows:
"If there is no God prayer is a delusion
and worship an absurdity. If God is sim
ply law or force, if he is inpersonal.
prayer is foolish. If, as some teach, God
has decided to save some and elected
others to be lost, then surely prayer will
avail nothing. But there is a God. He
cares for his creatures and he hears their
prayers. Has God given men the instinct
of prayer only to mock their upward looks
and pleadiug voices? Surely man is not
merely a half hinge, an interrogation
point with no answer. God can manage
this world and at the same time care for
his children. If man can master nature's
forces and harness them so they shall do
his bidding, surely God can use them in
the service of his children. If he invites
us to pray, has taught us to pray and
promised to answer us, he will surely lind
a way to do it."
REV. FATHER CHIAPPA OF LOS
GATOS PREACHES ON "HELL"
Father Vincent Chiappa of Los Gatos
preached the morning sermon yesterday
at the Church of St. Ignatius. It was a
doctrinal address on "Hell." He said in
brief;
"According to the words of the parable,
'Gather up first the cockle and bind it into
bundles to burn, but gather the wheat
into my barn. 1 the just and the wiirked
till doomsday will live on the same earth.
They will be fostered by the same son of
justice, Jesus Christ; will receive increase
and vigor from the same shower of divine
grace, will receive the same sacraments,
inhale the same air. Yet, like good and
noxious plants, though growing side by
side the one converts the Plements of the
soil into life-giving substance, the other
changes them into deadly poison. The
one supplies costly furniture for the Mas

BEARING OTHER'S BURDENS IS
THE HIGHEST USE OF LIFE
At St. Luke's Church yesterday morning
the rector. Rev. D. C. Garrett, preached
on "Burden-bearers" from the text,
"Bear ye one another's burdens and so
fulfill the law of Christ."â Gallatians vi:2.
Mr. Garrett said that what St. Paul
meant by the law of Christ was the new
commandment. "Love one another." He
showed the naturalness of this law. Said
"Christ gave It new motive and Â»ew
power, but the principle prevailed In part
in the religions of the Old World and was
even postulated In the instincts of animal
life. There Is not only the survival of the
fittest but the self-surrender of the strong
to save the weak. This Is Illustrated In
various ways. The same law holds g-ood
In social and organic relations. The joy
as well as the duty of bearing others'
burdens is the highest use to be made of
life."
DR. NELANDER PREACHES ON
DESTINY OF THE NATION
The Rev. Dr. E. Nelander preached a
pennon yesterday morning to the congre
gation of the First English Lutheran
Church on the manifest destiny of the
nation. The stately edifice on Geary
Ftrr>et was filled with an interestd con
gregation, who followed the speaker
with close attention. Dr. Nelander said
in conclusion:
"The strange record of territorial ex
pansion and the startling development of
national power looks liKe a manifest des
tiny. We may not want Cuba, Porto
Rico or the Philippines, but the question
Is, Can we avoid taking them under our
care? God save us as a nation from the
pride of conquest, but may He make us
willing to assume any responsibility which
He may impose upon us. It has been dis
covered that our wealth is over fifty
thousand millions, and that we are the
richest nation on earth. We are among
the great military nations. Like Pompey,
our President can stamp his foot and
summon an army. On statistical author
ity there are 27.000.000 of religious people
in this country. It Is for them to lay
this mighty country of ours at the feet
of Christ."
DR. YOORSANGER SPEAKS ON
COLONIZATION BY FORCE
Rabbi Voorsanger spoke at the Turk
street Temple last night, under tho
auspices of the Social Democratic party,
on the subject of "Colonization." His
address was an historical resume of the
various migratory movements In man
kind's march in search of better condi
tions. He said in brief:
"No nation's right to Its lands has
been recognized by superior forces. We
have displaced the Indian, and he lias
conquered some preceding type. I will
draw no conclusion, as to the Justice or
injustice of conquest, but will conclude
by saying that in my opinion no m^n
has a right to take -what belongs to
another."'
An animated discussion of the question
by the members of the party followed

IV. KENG LEAR.
The Play as an Acting Drama.
The poet Shelley said of "King Lear"
that It was "the most perfect specimen
of the dramatic art existing In the
world." Another critic has said of it + hat
it Is "the greatest single achievement in
poetry of the Teutonic or northern gen
ius."
Though the full measure of these esti
mates the critical world may not wholly
consent to. yet the world comes very near
to consenting to them. "King Lear" is
universally admitted to be one of the
very finest productions of dramatic art
and dramatic poetry the world has
known.
And yet, great as "King Lear" Is as a ;
play and as a dramatic poem, its great- I
ness Is not altogether realizable to the
ordinary reader.
The ordinary reader has rarely the '
imagination necessary properly to con- '
celve the greatness of the characteriza- j
tlona of the play or the insight necessary >
properly to perceive the depth and mean
ing of its ethical lessons.
It thus follows that for a perfect appre- !
EDWIN FORREST AS KING LEAR.
elation of the- power and beauty of this
great play one must see it acted.
But here, again, another difficulty
arises. Great as the play "King Lear"
is, it deals with situations so improbable,
it supposes character and conduct so un
usual, it calls for the impersonation of
intellectual qualities so closely bordering
upon the fantastic and grotesque, that
unless acted with consummate skill the
play ceases to be of the realm of serious
drama and becomes absurd melodrama-
Only the greatest actors should play in
"King Lear." Only the greatest actors
really can play in it.
This difficulty was realized early in the !
history of the play. We have no ovi- j
dence indeed that "King Lear" was ever i
popular In the form in which Shakes- j
peare wrote it until within comparatively
recent times.
In 1681, three-quarters of a century af
ter the play was first written, there was
made a version of the play, long known, |
from the name of the person who made j
It, as "Tate's version," and this "King |
Lear" is the only "King Lear" that for j
nearly a hundred and fifty years was
ever heard of.
The principal differences between the
amended version and the real version
were two. In Tate's "King Lear" the
play ended happily; "otherwise," says
the* author, "I must have incumbered the
stage with dead bodies, which conduct
makes many tragedies conclude with un
seasonable jests." In the amended ver
sion, also, the part of the Foolâ one of
the most delicately pathetic but difficult
ly realizable parts in the whole Shakes
pearean repertoire â was omitted.
When, then, we read of "King Lear," or
of actors playing "King Lear" in the
whole of the eighteenth century or in the
first two decades of the nineteenth cen
tury, we must remember that it is not
Shakespeare's "King Lear" that Is meant, j
but Tate's or some other version of the
play. Shakespeare's great creation was
as yet but imperfectly understood.
Though Betterton, Barton Booth and
Quln all played "King Lear," there does
not seem to have been any really great
"King Lear" till Garrick's time. Then
there were two â Garrick himself and Gar
rick's great rival. Spranger Barry.
In the year 1756 Barry began to play
"King Lear" in Covent Garden. Garrick,
with whom from the first the part had
been one of his very best, considered this
a challenge, and at once responded by re
viving "King Lear" in Drury Lane. Lon- â 
don, and Indeed all intellectual England, |
became divided into two campsâ the be
lievers in Garrick's art and the believers
In Barry's. Here is one of the epigrams
of the day:
The town has found out different wayg
To praise the different Lears.
To Barry they give loud huzzas;
To Garrlckâ only tears.
Here is another:
A kingâ nay, "every Inch a king,"
Such Barry doth appear.
But Garrick's quite another thing-
He's "every inch King Lear."
These jeux d'esprit of course were fa
vorable to Garrick; and. indeed, if their
point be founded on fact, and there la
little doubt but that it is, they concede
to Garrick a place in his art the very
highest.
But not all the wits of the town were
with Garrick. It was said that Oarrick
was jealous of his younger rival, and so
much so that there was more than clev
erness in the following epigram, got oft
with purpose to wound him; there was
real point and sting in it:
Critics, attend and Judge the rival Lears,
Whilst each commands applause and each your
tears.
Then own the truthâ well he performs his part
Who touches, even Garrlck, to the heart.
Subsequent to Garrick'g day "King

tvden. Dr. "William J. Rolfe, Dr. Hamilton W.
Dr. Isaac X. Demmon, Dr. Vlda D. Scudder
Lear" for many years does not seem to
have met with great success. Once (in
1788) the "tragic muse," Mrs. Siddons,
chose the play for her benefit night and
played Cordelia, while her brother, John
Kemble, renowned for his power in the
"curse part," played the King. But Mrs.
Siddons did not much affect the play, nor
indeed has any other great actress, al
though critics universally agree in esti
mating Cordelia as one of the very no
blest of all the Shakespearean heroines.
But the part Is too slight, too merely a
sketch, to be attractive to actresses who
have a reputation to make, or, indeed, to
sustain.
The first great Lear, In the true Shake
spearean conception of the character, was
Edmund Kean. Kean's first appearance
in the part was in Drury Lane in 1820.
But although by general consent Kean is
ranked the greatest impersonator of
Shakespearean character the world has
known, still his Lear was not in all its
parts a complete success. Indeed Hazlitt,
who was an intense admirer of Kean,
thought that in some respects It was in
ferior to Kemble's.
We said that the first great Lear, in,
the true Shakespearean conception of the,
part, was Edmund Kean; but c i Kean
did not introduce
â  into his. version of
â  the play Shakes
â peare's Fool. This
â was done by Mac
â ready January 25,
â IB3S. Macready thua
â has the ' honor of
â having been the nnÂ«
â who first presented
â Jto the world thÂ«
â  play of ''King Lear"
â as Shakespeare
â wrote it. But even
â  Mai- ready wad very
â nervous about the
â matter. On January
â 4 he wrote: "My
â opinion of the intro
â  duction of the Fool
His that, like many
â â â â â â â â â terrible contrasts in
â â â â â â â â â poetry and painting,

tion it will fall to
â â â â â â â â â effect. It will either
â weary of distract the
â  spectator." Next
â day he wrote that he
â  had mentioned his
â apprehension t o
â some- friends: ' "I
â  described," 1 c says,
â  "the sort of fragile,
â â â â â â â â â hectic, beautiful
â  faced boy that he
â should be, and
â â â â â â â â â stated my b< lief that
â  never could be
â  acted. Bartley (a
â  friend) observed
â â â â â â â â â that a woman
â â â â â â â â â should play it. I
â  caught at the idea
â â â â â â â â â and instantly ex
â  rlalmed, \vliss Her
â  ton is the very per
â sori!' I â > as <!,â 
--â  lighted at the
â â â â â â â â â â â â thought." And the
â â â â â â â â â part of Lear's Fool,
â  since Macready's
â time, has been al
â  most always played
â by a woman.
I Macready's Lear
â was one of his great-
Host parts. But, like
â â â â â â â â â most actors who
â â â â â â â â â have tried the part,
â he was not equally
â  good at all points of
â â â â â â â â â Jit. He especially ex
â  celled in lines calling
â  f<<r tenderness, pathos
â  and the expression
â of yearning and sym
â pa thy. The storm
HHHHHHHHHH'ii.'I stress of Lear's
moments of passion were scarcely
his. And yet Bulwer Lytton, who was
no mean judge, spoke of "the Titanic
grandeur" of Macready's Lear.
"King Lear held a conspicuous place
in those great Shakespearean revivals
that in the middle of the century Charles
Kean made at the Princess' and Samuel
Phelps made at Sadler's Wells. These
great actors played the part of Ltar
themselves, but, like their predecessor
Macready, they were each creater in the
milder and more pathetic aspects of
Lear's highly composite character than
in the larger and more powerfully im
pressive aspects of it.
In America the two great Lears have
been Edwin Forrest and Edwin Booth.
Lear was one of Forrest's greatest parts.
But Forrest had played too much and
too long in the way of "tickling the
ears of the groundlings" ever to become
a perfect Lear. He lacked the stateli
ness, the grandeur, the dignified vener
ableness vt him who was "every inch a
King." And yet Lear was a part in
which Forrest constantly kept overcom
ing the rough and obtrustive Individu
ality of his youth, and in which, there
fore, he constantly grew mellower and
nobler and greater. Booth's Lear,
though a noble one, was, of course, out
shone by his Richelieu and his 1-amlet.

STEAM SPEEDS AT SEA.
Power Required for Increased Speed.
Outlook for the Future.
As to the speed of the future. I remem
ber reading an article on mechanical im
possibilities written about twenty-five
years ago. It was we.l written, and pos
sibly It was generally correct, but one
operation, which was cited as impossible
of accomplishment, was that of propelling
a steamer at the rate of twenty-five miles
an hour across the ocean. At that time
the Atlantic had never been crossed by a
screw steamer at so high a rate as fifteen,
miles an hour, the Scotia being the fastest
liner in those days, she having crossed tne
Atlantic at an average rate of fourteen
and one-third knots. Steaming across me
ocean at the rate of twenty-five miles an
hour might, therefore, well have been
looked upon at that date as impossible,
but to-day there are steamers which have
reached that speed, and there are others
In course of construction which may prob
ably exceed that rate across the Atlantic.
Although, roughly speaking, the powir
required to propel a steamer varies with
the cube of the speed, yet before a third
of the next century expires another in
crease of at least SO per cent in ocean
speed may safely bo prophesied. How this
is to be accomplished it would be too
hazardous to attempt to surmise; but 1
may point out how I think it will not be
done, and that is by carrying and hand
ling tWOO tons of bunker coals In a hull
drawing nearly fifty feet of water. The
model of the ocean mail steamer of the
next century will probably be that of a
very much enlarged "destroyer" of great
breadth and length and small draught of
water forward.
Lighter and stronger materials will
compose the structure, which may be
moved by multiple propellers, possibly
working in a tunnel, so that a number of
wheels could be worked by separate
shafts, actuated by rotary motors, as the
sizes on screw shafts and engines and
now under construction are perilously
large: or the motive power may be pro
ducea by compressed air or gas. Then,
the form of least resistance probably be
ing discovered, the hull, broad and light
in comparison with the augmented di
mensions,, will rise on top of the waves
rather than pass through them. The roll
ing and pitching may be more severe than
at present, but with improved cabins and
a shortened voyage, the difference may
not be noticed. The construction of a
steamer of 65.000 tons will probably not
trouble the constructors of the future
nearly as much as did the building of the
Great Eastern those of the past. There
will be infinitely less labor, both mental
and physical, than was required for th^>
construction of a great ship in those day/

DUDES WIN
BY CLEVER
STICK WORK
Gcod Baseba 1 ! at Recreation
Park Between Oakland
and Santa Cruz.
Oakland 5. Santa Cruz 2.
The Dudes lid the trick yesterday after
n<Kin at Recreation grounds by laying low
all the shellfish that have been coming
up periodically from Santa Cruz. An
drews was touched for nine hits and five
men from Oakland crossed the rubber.
The Dudes played an errorless game and
generally outdid their opponents in stick
work.
The first inning brought a run to Oak
land. Hammoi d swatted a two-bagger
to left field and scored on Hardlo's sin
gle. In the second inning Bchmeer made
first on a hit, went to second on Bab
bitt's error of Moskiman's hit and scored
when McCarthy juggled a hot one off
Hutchinson's bat. In the seventh the
]>udes added two runs to the list. Ham
mond rolled out a two-bagger, cantered to
third on Donovan's hit, and then the Lob
sters began to juggle and make it easy
for Hammond to cross the plate. A wild
throw by (."lark to Devereaux, who a.l
-lowed the ball to pass through him. was
the accident. Donovan took second and
th.rd on the throw-In of Dunleavy's long
fiy to Dairymple, Donovan scoring on thi>
throw-in.
In the eighth it looked like a railroad
wreck for a time. -Moskiman was h!t by
The pitcher and Hutchinson, Hammond
n"d Hardie were sent to base on balls,
forcing Mosklman over the plate.
The runs of Santa Cruz were made In
the third and eighth. Croll made his first
but; on a hit and made Fccond on Mc-
Carthy's sacrifice. Babbitt then hit to
Hutchlnson, who threw home, but could
not "stave off" Croll; who scored. In
the eighth McCarthy was given his baso

Romps Away From Record
ing A ngel at Union Park.
Other Results.
D. J. Healey's brindje and white dog
Slsquoc liad no difficulty In lowering the
colors of Pasha Kennels' Recording An- j
gel yesterday at Union Coursing Park.
They ran but one course when the rep
resentative of Pasha Kennels was with
drawn on the ground that she was not In
condition for a contest. The match was
made a fortnight since, the dog being then
In training. The efforts to condition Re
cording Angel were not successful and '
her showing yesterday was a disappoint- ,
ment to her followers. After seeing Bis
quoc perform many coursing men ex
pressed the opinion that his half-sister
can never beat him. He has a great, |
open stride â which carries him over the I
ground at such a pace as to make bis i
opponent look like a very ordinary grey- I
hound.
Recording Angel was favorite at odd? j
of 5 to 3 when they went to .the slips for
the first course. When they were re
leased by James Grace, Sisquo< com- j
menced to draw away at or.cc and never j
left the result in doubt: Toward the end
the Angel was placed for a time, but
could not overcome the lead of her oppo
nent.
The Complimentary stake was won by
j one of the celebrated Clairs, Master Clair.
! He defeated En!n Pasha; Luxor, and
i should have met H. F. Anderson's Craw
' ford bad in the final. The Lad was uith
j drawn because of a hard course with
â¢ Brutus, hence Master Clair won the final
I by default.
R. E. de B. Lopez's grand young dog
j Whit* won the reserve stake, beat
i ing the speedy Lucky Dog in the final.
Lucky Dog led up and secured the first
two turns, but then died av.-uy, while j
! Whitehea â¢ went on a-id scored frequently.
The sport throughout the day was of
I the highest class and was witnessed by j
j a large number of spectators. The :
i weather conditions were favorable to the
! enjoyment of -outdoor Fport. as there was i
hardly mere than a touch of autumn '

COURSING AT INGLESIDE.
Judge Reilly acted very wisely when he |
decided yesterday that, after two "no ,
goes" In the final between Lily of the
West and Thornhlll, the final of the an- ,
nual stake should be run off next Sunday.
The coursing throughout the day was fast
and furious. Early In the stake Chicago
Boy, Rocker, Connemara and Bone were
hopelessly out of It. owing to the grueling
work. The day seemed an ideal one for
the hares and they appeared to hold j
charmed lives, as i:: several instances the [
field resembled the cress country run of i
a pack of f ix hounds as relief dogs, one
after another were released to stop the
course. In one Instance a hare was fol- '
lowed at a lively pace for quite a distance ;
by no less than flee dogs, among them !
being 1 rnhlll and Rocker.
The Consolation stake went to that good
hound and honest bread-winner Wild Tra
lee. Narclssua was the runner-up and j
showed in his courses that he had been
well trained and was prepared to go the
route. The results of the day were as
follows:

ROCKLIN BELLE WINS
AT SAN MATEO PARK
F. ChambMl's Rooklin Belle carried off
first honors yesterday at San Mateo
Coursing Park. St. Anthony, from the
Lopez Kennels, running- In the name of
N. P. Whiting, finished in second place.
He ran a bye in each of the three rounds
before the final. One was a natural bye,
the others accidental, owing to the with
drawal of Still True and Terronite be
cause of desperate courses. Both these
dogs were taken all over the field and
it was necessary 'to send out fresh dogs
to their assistance. . - : . â¢
Favorites were beaten with great regu

Recklessness of Cyclers Causes a
Runaway in the Park â Fun at
the Chutes and Sutro
Baths.
Owing to the threatening weather there
was no music at the park yesterday, but
the small crowd that gathered in search
if recreation was delightfully enter
tained by the "off mare 1 ' In the spank
ing team driven by E. M. Pepew of 308
San Jose avenue. As Mr. Depew was
nearlng the Garfield monument a : in
dem ridden by reckless cyclers flew past
the horses' heads and they took to the
shrubbery. Soon they were hopelessly
tangled In the trees, and Captain
Thompson, assisted by Mounted Officer
Delegaro, attempted to free them from
the buggy.
The "off mare" gave a lunge, freed
hersHf from the rig and started on a
mad race ('own the main drive. Captain
Thompson gave chase, but failed to get
within roping distance until near the
Superintendent's office, where he lassoed
the runaway.
Officer O'Shea attempted to assist Cap
tain Thomson, when the mare lunged
toward him, and before he could flnJ a
place of silety he was struck dowr by
the iron-shod hoofs of the animal. Cap
tain Thomnson dragged the animal away
and the officer, who had sustained a
severe laceration of the upper lip, was
taken to his home.
Mr. Depew returned home on a car and
the horses were taken to the stables by
their keeper.
The weather did not materially re
duce the usral Chutes' crowd. Several
thousand people passed through (ho
gates during the day and enjoyed the
various features.
At Sutro Bat ha the guests were enter
tained with the regular aquatic races,
the results of which follow:
Fifty-yard dash, noviceâ Laicken

FISHING IN THE WEST.
A Favorite Place With Former Presi-
dent Harrison for Casting a Line.
Such streams as the Fox River in Illi
nois, the Kankakee, the White or the Tlp
pecanoe of Indiana afford at times even
to-day very rood sport for the fly rod.
Ex-President Harrison and a few chosen
friends often make a fly-fishing trip for
bass along the Tippecanoe. which was
once a famous bass water, and even yet
is not quite shorn of its ancient glory.
These gentlemen would as soon think of
grand larceny or highway robbery as to
entertain the Idea of using anything: but
the fly on the small mouths of the Tippe
canoe. This stream may be waded on
many of its imm reaches, though It Is
best to take along a boat, and some an
glers prefer to fish it from a boat all the
way. The bass of this river are very
good fighters, and show the leaping in
stinct of the small-mouth species, some
times springing out higher . than one's
head as one stands playing the fish. The
average run is a pound or thereabouts,
though often one will take a fish much
heavier. The bucktall flies are good on
the Tippecanoe, though this seems to be
also a water where one may with profit
indulge In his notions for bright-colored
millinery In laying out one's supply of
file*.
The Ferguson and the silver doctor are
sometimes used effectively, and the Seth.
Green, with a cinnamon wing, has beeo
found good upon occasion, though as. to
these matters it Is not weil to sat forth
dogma. There is no ultimate truth dis
coverable in the matter of bass flies In
stream fishing. This method we may as
well call "broad fishing." since It is fol
lowed at all times of the day and on all
parts of the water. This is late sprmg
and summer fishing, when the bass a r e
lyln* about in the weedy pockets, under
log? or close to sharp banks, and this
method, of course, ends when the cold
weather comr-s ar,d the bass begin to con
gregate in the deep hnlep.
Thp Fox River in the summer time of
fers .-in occasional evening of go.x] fly
Ashing at such points as the reefs near
Clintonville* or KlKin. when the bass are
taking the natural fly in the cooler pnrt
of the day. and on this river, as well as
the Kahkakee, one may now and then
pick out a bass from midstream even In
the middle of the day. while the fish are
lying pretty well down and only looking
up lazily at the panorama WTrSii sails
past them outline,; against the sky. This
of fly fishing, not restricted abso
lutely to any part of the water, but in
tended for my fish that may happen to
be lying about loose, is the most common
form of fly fishing, and is sometimes very
successful when the bass are In the hti

VIOLETS.
Are Always in Style, but Not So
With Other Flowers.
It would be interesting to know, If It
could be known accurately, how much
money is spent on flowers in New York
City annually. Flowers are so abundant
hÂ«Te and so magnificently displayed in the
windows of the more fashionable thor
oughfares as to give the cltv, especially
at this season and through the winter, a
character which has often been comment
ed on by foreign visit' >rs.
"Violets?"
"H'm. Of course violets," says the flor
ist, sniffling. "YioWs last year and the
year before nnd this year."
"But don't new {lowers come into fash
ion every year?"
"Violets are always tn fashion."
There whs b rarely beautiful display of
violets in the window of this particular
store, ;t:ii! the head salesman, who seemed
busy, said that nobody would wear chrys
anthemums in the season of 1899-1900. At
another store, where the windows were
full of superb amethyst-colored asters
and chrysanthemums, the inquirer was
told in answer to his questioning that in
spite of all statements whatever to the
contrary, chrysanthemums certainly
would be in fashion this season.
"What O'you think I'm doing with all
these? Think I bought them for my best
girl?"
Between violets and chrysanthemums
there seems to be a rivalry. There is no
denying that the popularity of vioiets
saems likely to be hardly less than It was
last season, and already the conservatory
grown specimens are as lovely and frag
rant as ever. But, although the vogTUe of
the chrysanthemum will never igaln be
what It was some years ago, when this
country first learned from Japan the
splendors rtf that child of art and nature,
the flower seems to have fairly taken hold
of American taste and will never lose its
popularity for chamber decoration. It
seems to have been recognized that a
chrysanthemum is too big for one man's
buttonhole.
In the tray of rarer flowers the Bavar
dia jasmlnoldes. which the uninitiated
would taJte for a simple but broader sin
gle jasmine, seems likely to Increase that
hold upon the hearts and pocketbooks
of the luxurious which it gained last
year. The time has not yet come to
?pÂ«nk of orchids, but an exotic flower
which, ihough an orchid, has much of ihe
orchid magnificence in its appearance
Is the tritoma. a brilliant scarlet and
orange .pike flower from the Cape of
Good Hope. The current rumors of war
and the sympathies of the Holland Srcl
ety, with the South African origin and
orange color of this flower, ma make it
a favorite with New Yorkers of Dutch
extraction, but for some reason those
who may be supposed to know say that
it will never be fashionable. This n:nv
be because there are not enough Knick
erbocker Boer sympathizers to tway the
thoughtless multitude.â New York Trib

The carpenter on the Cyrus "Wakefield

Henry. The tool is stained with what
looks Ilk* rust, but the carpenter and
Btf-ward assert It is blood. After the mate
came down from the after house with
the hammer in his hand he went into his
room. After thÂ« captain had been laid
out in his bed dead Second Mate John

room with him and help him light the
candles. "The mate was scared to death,"
said the carpenter, â¢'and he would not

"The captain's brother-in-law brought
me back my hammer the da.y after thÂ«
captain died. -As he was taking it out
of the mate's room -Mr. Williamson said,
â¢Here, let me look at that.' He examined
the hammer closely, and' saying "It's a bit
rOsty, isn't it?' handed lt back to the boy
arid said, 'Take it forward.' ; After Cap
tain Henry died. the mate wanted to run
the Ship back to Montevideo arid bury the

have it, so we put into Port Stanley.

Mate Johnson la still' aboard the Cyrus
V. ikefleld, and while he is not very posi
tive, still ho. thinks Captain Henry was
killed by being washed off the after
i' r se. He was- forward at the time and
could not see what took, place. When

EUGENIE BLAIR
MAKES A HIT AT
THE ALHAMBRA
"Lady of Quality" Is
Well Received.
PROMISES A SUCCESSFUL RUN
MUCH THAT IS SUOGBSITVE, BUT
LITTLE TO OFFEND.
The Cast Is a Strong One, the Stage
Settings Perfect and the Produc
tion One Deserving of
Commendation.
Â«
"A Lady of Quality," as produced last
night at the Alhambra. was decidedly a
hit. There is little about it with which to
find fault and much to commend. For a
first night the play went smoothly and
was flatteringly received. This dramati
zation of the well-known novel by Fran
ces Hodgson Burnett, promises to have
a successful run for the week that It Is
billed here. The company is a strong one,
the stage settings perfect. There are
some things that border on the suggestive
in the piece, but there is really nothing
at which the most delicate feeling can
take offense.
Eugenic Blair, as Clorinda Wlldairs. the
wild child of fortune, was decidedly
strong in her Interpretation of the part,
and William Bramwell, as Sir John Oxon,
the heavy villain of the play, won admir
ation for his acting while he earned con
demnation for the character he portrayed.
The act whÂ«Â»re Miss Blair, aa the heroine,
hounded by her persecutor, strikes him a
blow that results in his almost instant
death was realistic and thrilling. In this
act Miss Blair shows to the best advan
tage.
The play abounds In tragic situations
and no one who admires plays with plenty
of villainy, adverse fate and the triumph
of the right will regret seeing "A Lady
of Quality." The unly bad feature of the
performance is the inability of the cast
to accommodate its voices to the acous
tics of the Alhambra. but this is some
thing that will probably be remedied as
it becomes accustomed to the surronnd
ings.
FUN AT THE CALIFORNIA.
"What Happened to Jones" Delighted
a Laughter-Loving Audience.
'â¢What Happened to Jones" Is a rattling
gc>od comedy and in order to do it full ,
justice It must be played by a rattling
good company. From last night's per
formance one could easily see that but
half of the company was strong enough
to do Justice to this bright play, and this
half consisted of the male members,
headed by Harry Corson Clarke. He Is a :
clever comedian, who understands full well
the significance of humorous allusions
and from whose lips a clever bon-mot or
telling joke is doubly amusing. He is
quick, wide-awake and high up in his
work. In fact he Is a whole performance
in himself. But he cannot be the whole i
performance of "What Happened to
Jones" ail by himself, and here is where
he makes his mistake.
The women of the company are with
the exception of Carrol Marshall ama
teurish. Laura Crews has no idea of the
dashing Cissy and is altogether too sim
pering. The balance of the female cast
is entirely too slow for the performance.
The men are all well up in their work.

FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
Organization of the System in Use
Now in Massachusetts.
The free public library movement In
the commonwealth of Massachusetts,
where the Idea found Its birth, now stands
very near completion, so far as Its uni
versal extension Is concerned. There are
now only seven towns In that State that
are without free library privileges, and
these comprise less than one-half per cent
of the population. In the free libraries of
Massachusetts there are now 3.750,<>"0 vol
umes, with an annual circulation of 7,666,
--666, or over three volumes to every inhab
itant. The amount given for libraries and
library buildings In Massachusetts In the
shape of gifts and bequests reaches in
money alone to nearly $S,ihX),OOO. The value
of gifts in tho way of bonks, furniture,
pictures, sculpture, etc., would add enor
mously to this amount. Since the first
report of the Library Commission in Jan
uary, 1891, forty towns have been adorned
with new library buildings costing 11.355.
--000. These have mostly been gifts,
generally from Individuals, and their cost
has not unfavorably affected the tax rate.
Gifts and bequests in nine other towns
amounting to at least $40u,iXX) will event
ually be expended for such buildings, [n
five other towns new public buildings for
various uses, including free library ac
commodations, have been built by the
municipalities or given by private bene- ,
flcence. In the past year bequests and
gifts for public library purposes have
amounted to more than $2O.vXi). Certain
townships are so large in area and are so
made up of widely separate villages that
a central library would not accommodate
the public demand. Bamstable has there
fore six independent free libraries, and
Sutton has five. Willlamstown and the
city of Northampton have three each,
and each of fourteen others have two.
The city of Everett has twn fine public
library buildings erected by bequests and ,
gifts in separate sections of the place. !
Boston has ten branch libraries and sev
enteen stationsâ eleven of the latter with
deposits of books from the central library,
while five are reading moms and one 13

JOSEPH KENNER
FINDS DEATH IN
A PRISON CELL
Sad End of an Old
Police Clerk.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
&08 Broadway, November 12.
â  Joseph Kenner was found dead in a cell
1 at the City orison shortly before noon
to-day.
Death had come to Kenner very sud
j denly. An hour previously he had asked
a "trusty" for some matches, and only
j half an hour prior to his taking off he
I chatted througn the wicket with another
"trusty" and was seen smoking a pipe.
' When Acting Jailer Curtis went the
! rounds just before noon he called to Ken
j ncr, and, receiving no response, opened
i the cell door and found him lying on the
; floor. Dr. J. H. Todd was immediately
i summoned, but his services were not re
quired. The prisoner was dead.
It was at first supposed that Kenner
' had committed suicide, but a casual
i scrutiny disclosed no circumstances sup
porting that theory. His death is believed
to have been due to epilepsy, to which
Kenner was sometimes subject. The
body has been removed to the Morgue
and Coroner Mehrmann has ordered an
inquest, to be held to-morrow afternoon.
Kenner was a native of Rogersville,
Term.. aged 50 years, and his remarkable
downfall was entirely due to his insatl-
I able thirst for liquor. In the seventies
he was a bright, clever young politician
locally, a man of family, good connections
and a gentleman held in highest esteem.
In November, 1879, he was appointed Po
lice Clerk under the late Peter Pumyea.
Chief of Police at that time, and served
creditably until June, 188$ when he re
signed. He bad previously heM a re-
I sponsible position in the railway mail ser
vice.
Since his wife's death, several years
ago, Kenner's downfall began, and owing
to his convivial habits he spent very
much of his time in jail. About three
1 months ago he returned from a visit to
his son in Tennessee, where the latter is
: a paying teller in a bank. The son. it is
said, urged his father not to return to
California, but no Inducement offered
I stayed Kenner in his determination.
Just a week ago Kenner was released
j from the County Jail, where he had been
j sent by the Police Judge to serve thirty
| days in the hope that he might leave
j liquor alone. Last Monday he was again
! arrested and served three days in the
I City Prison. Last Friday morning- he was
I given his liberty. Yesterday morning
! Officer Kyte haled him to jail for the
i last time. Deceased has a sister residing
I in Temescal.

NERVE
Exhibited in a Request to the Gov-
ernment for Transportation.
Many novel propositions are received by
the Government officials here, but one
presented to Secretary Hitchcock to-day
by a citizen of Hungary eclipses all others
in this line. The Hungarian evidently
wishes to make a tour of the United
States at the expense of the Government,
and at the same time gather data for a
book, giving his impressions of America.
He has requested that transportation be
furnished him. his wife, five children and
two servants, from his home in Hungary
to the United States and return, so as to
enable him to inspect the unoccupied
lands cf this country for the purpose of
colonizing a number of his countrymen
here. This trip would involve a tour of
Idaho, Wyoming. Colorado. Kansas, Mon
tana. North and South Dakota and in
fact, almost every State in the Union,
and would be an extremely expensive
journey, as the Hungarian expects this
Government to defray all the expenses of
his family, in addition to which he is to
receive remuneration for his trouble.
The communication was referred to the
Commissioner of the Land Office for ac
tion. The proposition created some
amusement in the department, and of
course, the Government will not entertain
it for a moment. No reply has yet been
made to this proposition, but the Hun
garian will be informed there are too
many native Americans who would gladly
take a trip of this character at the ex
pense of the Government, without going
abroad to bestow favors of this kind.â

day on starting on a round with a woman

a good player: "Now. enddie, I want to
Improve my game. If you see me doing
anything wrong correct me, and give me
any hints you think necessary. The
caddie said he would, after two or
three bolea had been played (in which
the women had not distinguished them

whispered: "Mr. A., if you want to im

TWO steam whalers arrived yester- 1

The Britisn bark East Indian arrived
from Newcastle, Australia, â  yesterday,
after a fair passage of 74 days. She was
caught in several electrical storms, and as
the lightning: played hide and seek among
the yards some of the crew thought their
last day had come. The revenue cutter
Bear was also caught in a similar kind of
a storm, and several other ships have ex
perienced more thunder and lightning
than usual while at sea this last week or
so. Some shipmasters think that these
electrical storms are the forerunners of
the great shower of meteors expected in
a few days. â¢ .. : -
O. Nilsen of 1023 Greenwich street was
badly injured yesterday. He was rolling
a big flywheel along the floor of the build

falling, but failed. The rim struck on the
point of hi? right fool nearly severing
the big and second toe?. He was hurried
t<-> the Â« Harbor Hospital, where Dr.

OFFICER ATTACKED BY
DESPERATE PRISONER
San Diego Deputy Left for Dead
by Convict Ross.
Manacled Thief Jumps Into the Water,
Attempting to Escape After His
Bloody Deed.
IN a solitary cell of the dungeon at 1
San Quentin. manacled and shackled
to a stone wall, rests Albert Ross, a j
convict who passed through this city
yesterday In charge of Sheriff Mat
thew' Stewart of Santa l arbara, to
pervo ten years for burglary. It will not
be his fault if he is not a murderer, but
the only thing that worries him is that
l.y Fme-'iring his hands with the blood of a
fellow man he did not regain his liberty.
In a hospital at San Luis Obispo lies ;
W. J. Ward, Deputy Sheriff of San Diego j
County, with bruised and battered head, !
the victim of Ross desperate attempt to
regain his freedom, the probability being
that the brave officer will never again in
this life gnse on the features of his wife
and three little children. â  .' .
Sheriff Stewart related a bloody tale
when he reached the prison yesterday of
the attack of. Ross oil Deputy Sheriff
Ward. Ward loft San Diego Saturday on
the steamer Santa Rosa in charge of
Ross, and was Joined at Santa Barbara
by Sheriff â¢.-art. who had in custody
Andrew Castro, a Mexican sentenced to
Pan Quentln for two years for grand
larceny. Castro wa3 formerly sentenced
for ten years, but was granted a new
trial on appeal to the Supreme Court, |
with the result that eight years were cut j
off his term of imprisonment. .
When the party of two officers and two
prisoners reached Port Harford at 2
o'clock Saturday afternoon; .they were i
standing on the upper deck. Ross ex- j
pressed a das Ire to lie down,' and was !
taken to his stateroom by Ward. Fifteen,
minutes later Stewart was amazed to j
hear his name called and. upon looking
over the Bide of the vessel to 'see Ro.ss,
6*.i!l shackled, swimming In the water. :
Ross was reached with a rope, hoisted,
aboard and asked where Ward .
â¢'1 knocked him on the head," was the
laconic reply.
â¢ Running to the stateroom door and find
ing it locked. Stewart brokelt in and found i
Ward lying on the floor In a pool of blood.
He was given medical treatment, but on
regaining consciousness became delirious
and begged those around him to keep the
liend away.
"Don't let him hit me again." â 
The Injured officer was taken to San j
Luis Qbispo,. and shortly before Sheriff
Stewart left the prison he received a dis
patch that Ward could not live until
morning.
In rotating the tale of the assault to
Stewart, Convict Ross gave the following j
coldblooded description of what occurred i
after he left the upper deck. " - â 
"Ward sat in a chair," he said, "and I
lay on the bunk. In a few. minutes I saw !
he was nodding and. taking the heavy

"In the first- place," said I>r. Franklin
last night, "any man who thinks, he can

j better try it if he will not be- convinced
â¢"by the experience of others. The lesson'
' will be a bitter . one.. Sickness and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1899.
EXPERTS WILL DISCUSS
FLOOD-WATER STORAGE
MR. ELWCOD MEAD.
EL.WOOD MEAD, the Irrigation expert In charge of the Investigations of
the department of Agriculture throughout the United States, arrived
In this city yesterday on an official visit connected with the depart
ment. Mr. Mead, who for the* past eleven years has filled the position of
State Engineer of Wyoming: with distinction, accepted his present re
sponsible office last July. While here he will attend the convention called by
the California State Association for the Storag-e of Flood Waters.
â  "My business here at this time," he said last night, -"is In connection with
o\ir studies of the duty of water and of the water-right law and customs of
California. During the past year we have been keeping a record of the vol
ume of water used, and the time It was used. In Irrigation of crops. In fifteen of
the arid States and Territories. The object of this was to furnish Informa
tion for courts, water commissioners, farmers and canal companies regard
. Ing the volume of water that Is required. One of our stations for these meas
urements has been at Riverside. I am out lure to visit Mr. Irving, who Is In
charge of that station. We are also collecting Information regarding the
â  laws and methods for acquiring rights to water from our rivers and the meth
ods of protecting those rights, the object being 1 to assist the States In the
enactment of better laws and, if possible, securing uniformity.
"Professor H. K. Hurst of the State University is assisting me in this
work, and I .am here In San Francisco now especially to see him.
"As to the convention which opens to-morrow, I think that a convention to
discuss the irrigation situation in this State and to discuss policies for the
storage of the State's water supply, and the enactment of laws for the secur
ing of greater economy in its use of water, cannot help but be beneficial to the
cause of Irrigation. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the situation to ex
press any opinion as to the policy to be adopted, but it Is greatly to be hoped
that it- will be a harmonious convention and that there will be an agreement,
both as to the policy to be adopted and the results to be achieved.
"There Is no question as to the fact that water Is worth more in Califor
nia than in any other State in the Union. And in the methods of, distribution
and application to land there are few sections In the world that are equal to
this State. What California lacks Is adequate titles to water rights and suffi
cient means for their protection. Improvements in these directions would re
sult in great benefit."
At Metropolitan Temple to-morrow evening Mr. Mead will deliver an ad
dress on the subject of irrigation, under the auspices of the California State
Association for the Storage of Flood Waters. J. B. Llppincott will also speak.
The following is a list of the delegates appointed to represent the Califor
nia Miners' Association at the convention to be held to-morrow by the Cali
fornia State Association for the Storage of Flood Waters: John M. Wright,
Frank R. Wehe., W. W. Montague, H. H. Hunter, A. Caminetti. Andrew G.

SUDDEN TARING OFF
OF GEORGE JOHNSON
GEORGE JOHNSON.
GEORGE JOHNSON, for many years
employed by T. J. Walsh & Co.,
retail liquor dealers, died yes
terday after a short illness. His
death was as sudden as It was unex
pected, and proved a great shock to his
family and friends. Aortic stenosis was
assigned as the cause of his sudden tak
ing off. He was attended in his last ill
ness by Dr. J. A. Hughes, 'me physician
was astounded when the tidings of his
patient's death were sent to him, as he
had left him the day before in a condition
to return to his employment.
The young man was extremely popular
and numbered his friends by the hun
dreds. He had earned the confidence and
high esteem of his employers, with whom
he had been engaged for the past ten
years, and they keenly feel the loss of a
faithful and painstaking employe. He
was the sole support of his widowed
mother and sisters. Mr. Johnson was a
member of Rincon Parlor, N. S. G. W.,
and other social organizations.

SOLDIER BOYS
Told to Use Their
Clubs Freely.
Special orders have been Issued to the
police officers regarding their treatment
of the soldiers who show the least In

any way to create trouble. These orders
are of such a nature that It behooves the
boys In blue to be on their best behavior
while enjoying the freedom of the city
and taking in the sights.
Since the clash with the numbers of
the Forty-sixth the police detail that pa
trols the tenderloin districts has been
doubled, and now the instructions have
gone forth to the peace promoter to tol
erate no foolishness from the soldiers.
They have been instructed to use their
clubs with liberality and freedom and to
keep an especial lookout for members of
the Tennessee regiment. The department
Is determined that the rights of citizens
shall lot protected and respected, and a

Assigned to the Old

WILL MARCH BEFORE MILES
BIG PARADE AT THE PRESIDIO
THIS MORNING.
Five Regiments of Volunteers, Be
sides the Regular Artillery, in
tine at the Golf
Links.
I To be home tn time for Thanksgiving is
the principal thought 'of the men of the
Tennessee Regiment, and the first care of
its colonel was to have an early date set
for the muster out of his men. The date
so far decided upon is the 23d inst., and
officers and clerks and mustering-out of
ficials will work with a will with that
date in view. . â 
The regiment reached camp yesterday
after running the gamut of enthusiasm
from the Folsom street dock to the Pre
sidio gate. When the men left the trans
port and were lined up on the wharf they
were addressed first by J. Wesley Games,
one of Tennessee's Congressmen; Adju
tant (General Brandon, who is here repre
senting the Governor of Tennessee, and
Mrs. Ada Van Pelt. The Tennessee dele
gation of welcome was. there, too, and
between speeches and congratulations .the
ladies of the delegation decorated the sol
diers with wreaths and flowers and filled
their pockets with good things to eat.
Tho Tennessee Regiment had the dis
tinction of being reviewed by General
Miles. He accompanied General Shafter
to the reviewing stand at the corner of
Bush street and Van Ness avenue and
watched the regiment as it marched past.
On arriving at the Presidio the command
was assigned to the camp formerly occu
pied by the California regiment. The
men were given straw for their mat
tresses and their baggage followed, them
into camp without much delay, so by
night they were all comfortable. .
There are two vacancies in the comple
ment of regimental officers, both of them
surgeons. They will probably be filled by
| the time the regiment is mustered out,
far it is entitled to be mustered out with
all the officers It brought into the ser
vice.
There will be one of the biggest parades
ever given in this department this morn
inK- General Miles, weather permitting,
will review all the outgoing volunteers
. with the exception of tho Forty-sixth In
fantry, which will make its way to the
transport Pathan while the others are
marching over the hills. There will be
over TWO troops in line.
The parade will form on the hill near
! the south gate of the Presidio and close
to the golf links. The south gate is where
First avenue enters the Presidio. On the
right of the line will be the battalion of
the Third Artillery stationed here, all
foot batteries. Next to that in order
will be the Fortieth. Forty-fourth, Thir
ty-eighth, Forty-fifth, Forty-second,
Troop G of the Sixth Cavalry and Light
Battery C of the Third Artillery. The
| formation will be "regimental columns of
I masses," or the regiments in columns of
i companies at close intervals, and abreast
lof each other. To form the regiments in
| line would spread the line over a mile and
I a half, bo the deeper formation had to be
chosen.
Colonel H. B. Freeman, Twenty-fourth
â  Infantry, commandant of the Presidio,
i will be In command, and First Lieutenant
; McNair, ordnance officer of the post, will
I act as assistant adjutant general. First
] Lieutenant EltinÃe. Pixth Cavalry, will
act as Colonel Freeman's aid. General
Shafter will be accompanied by his staff
j and General Miles will have with him
! Colonel Mlchler, his aid, who is traveling
with him.
The Forty-sixth regiment Is under or
i ders to sail for the Islands to-day. It will
leave the Presidio this morning about 9
o'clock if the weather be not Inclement.
Lieutenant E. W. Mumford of Company
A of the Forty-fifth Infantry was ordered
before the examining board early last
week. He has been notified that the
I board will report him physically and men
tally capable of performing the duties of
his rank.
James A. Conroy of Company G of the
Ninth Infantry died at the general hot
pi tal yesterday.
There have been no further serious
symptqms among the men of the Forty
second regiment who were poisoned last
Saturday. All who were sent to the hos
pital are well on their way to recovery,
and there will be no fatal cases. A board
of inquiry Is now looking into the matter
to ascertain if there be any blame, and If
so, to whom it attaches.
MRS. MARY ANN WILDER.
Death of a Pioneer Woman Noted for
Her kasr Charities.
By the death of Mrs. Mary Ann Wilder
on Saturday afternoon San Francisco
loses another of those vigorous women
who helped to lay the foundations of so
ciety here In the early days, and who for
a long period of years has been among
the potent and helpful spirits of the com
munity.
Mrs. Wilder was a Miss Watson. She
was born in Philadelphia In 1532, and was
therefore In her sixty-seventh year at the
time of her death. When yet a child she
removed with her parents to Indiana, and
when but two months more than 14 years
old was married in that State to Lorenzo
Ingargiola, with whom she came to this
city In ISM. Since her arrival here she has
lived continuously In San Francisco, and
therefore at the time of her death was
one of Ha oldest residents.
By her first husband she was the moth
er of eighteen children, of whom there re
main to morn her loss seven: Mrs. C.
Baker Mrs. William R. Elliott, Mrs. Vin
cent Baraco. Mrs. G. W. Granniss. Miss
Lillian M. Ingargtola, Frank Ingargiola
and Augustus Ingargiola. It was at the
home of her youngest daughter, Miss In
gargiola 1124 Bush street, that she died.
Her second husband, William R. Wilder,
survives her.
In the early days of California woman s
help was needed in many ways, and Mrs.
Wilder, although not a trained physi
cian or nurse, soon became a ministering
comforter and friend to the sick and to
the poor. For years she was active In
that good work, and did not cease it un
til her own strength broke down. With
willing anil prompt help of heart and
hand and purse she endeared herself to a
wide circle of men and women in all
classes of society, and was not only a
good wife, a noble mother and a generous
friend but one of those ministers of gen
uine charity whose influences are wider
than can ever be known. Now that she
has passed from us, her face will be
missed in many a home, and a keen sense
Sf personaUoss will be felt in hearts that
will long cherish her memory and the re
membrance of the thousand kind deeds
and gentle observances that made the
tenor of her earnest, loving and well
spent life.
