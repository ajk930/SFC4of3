DENVER, Sept. âA special to
the News from Florence. Colo.,
says: One of the most appall
ing* accidents in the history of
the Denver and Rio Grande oc
curred at 4 o'clock this afternoon, four
and one-half miles west of this city.
Six persons were killed outright and
five badly injured.
The killed and injured were passen
gers on a Phillips- excursion
train, west bound, which collided with
an east-bound freight train. The ex
cursion train consisted of one day
coach and two Pullman tourist sleep
ers. There were about forty passen
gers, most of them from Massachusetts,
en route to the Pacific Coast. The spe
cial had orders to run to Reno siding,
and when only a few hundred yards
from the siding it collided with the j
freight train. j
The trains came together with terrific j
fnrce. The second Pullman telescoped j
the first one. and the day coach is a â ,
complete wreck.
The freight train consisted of fifty |
narrow gauge care. loaded with ore and j
lumber and wreckage is strewn along j
the tracks for nearly half a mile.
All the trainmen saved themselves by
jumping. It is understood the freight |
had orders to take the siding at Reno,
but for - me reason it failed to do so.
A special with physicians was sent
from this city to the scene of the wreck j
and the survivors were brought to this
city. Later the injured were taken to
Pueblo. Mrs. Wills is hovering be
tween life and death. The others will
â  â  ~ .--â â - ~ - . Â«
recover.
E. S. Plaisted. one of the excursion
party from Revere. Mass., said:
"Our party of thirty-five or forty per
sons left Boston on Wednesday morn
ing last on a pleasure and business tour
to the Pacific Coast. I had been riding
in the first sleeper, but had just entered
the day coach with the Pullman con
ductor and had got comfortably seated
when there came an awful crash. It
seemed to me as if a ponderous stone
bridge had fallen upon our car. I
quickly doubled myself up and waited
for the. worst. I found I was not seri
ously hurt and with a little effort \vas
soon extricated from under the debris.
I looked for the conductor who sat by
my side and there he lay a corpse. Two
other men in the same car (there were
but four in the day coach) escaped.
This car was a complete wreck as was
the tourist sleeper next to it. There
â were six persons killed, five young peo
ple and our Pullman conductor, who
came with us from Boston. George J.
Judkins, who was traveling to his home
at Spokane, Wash., had the misfortune
to see all three of his children killed,
while he escaped with a few bruises
and scratches. The poor man is almost
distracted with grief."

BRITONS FEAR THAT BOERS WILL
PASS OVER NATAL'S FRONTIER
Transvaal Crisis Has Reached the Critical Stage Where
Peace or War Rests Entirely Within the
Hands of Kruger.
LONDON. Sept. 23.â Never at any
stage of the Transvaal crisis has â 
peace or war rested so entirely
within the hands of President
Kruger. The longer he. delays
i precipitating a definite issue the better
! are the chances for peace. He now
! knows to what extent he can rely on
sections of South Africa to uphold him
! and he realizes that the British will, If
S possible, avoid a conflict until the last
i transport lands her men, and he is too
I wily a leader not to know the military
advantage that comes to the aggressor.
His appeals to the foreign powers to
j intervene have apparently been hope
' less, but his efforts to drag in the
j Orange Free State have been success
l fu!, and if he honestly intends to defy
j Great Britain he never will have a bet
ter opportunity than at present. It is
j such reason which is uppermost in the
i j minds of the thinking British and
' which prompts them to fear that before
: ! next week's Cabinet meeting the Boers
j will have passed over Natals fron
! tier.
If they have not there will be much
j ground for believing President Kru
! ger intends an ultimate backdown,
though whether he is strong enough to
carry his people with him in such ac
{ tionis open to great doubts. The cab
inet council merely verifies the logical
' supposition that Great Britain will is
' sue no hostile ultimatum until she is in
a position to back it up.
The impression that war is inevitable,
which is now fairly general, is based
! almost solely upon the belief that the
! Boers will not submit, while it is im
! possible for Great Britain to recede
i from the position which the Secretary
\ of State for the Colonies, Joseph Cham
berlain, brought about. The recent ne
gotiations upon the part of the Colo- |
I nial Secretary have not tended to ap- j
j pease the peace party in England. The j
j Speaker declares that "to fight over a
question of etymology is naturally im
possible." by which the paper refers to i
suzerainty being the whole base of the i
; dispute.
The Speaker and some of the other .
I Liberal papers take the view that Mr.
Chamberlain has made it as hard as I
| possible for President Kruger to ac
cept 'his terms.
Sir Edward Clarke. Q. C. former So
' licitor General, writes to the Times
that he sees no casus belli and hopes
Parliament will be summoned, so that !
: the whole affair may be explained to i
j him and other Conservatives.
W. T. Stead, Mr. Chamberlain's bit
' ter opponent, is bringing out a pam
i phlet. "Shall I Slay My Brother Boer?"
\ an appeal to the consciences of Great
I Britain, in which he reiterates his ac
i cusations of Mr. Chamberlain's com
plicity in the Rhodesian conspiracy of
1595 and declares that "war would be
I a stain upon Great Britain's escutcheon
i as foul as that by which the Dreyfus
case has sullied the fair name of j
i France." He compares Mr. Chamber
i lain to General Mercier and the South
j African committee which tried â  the
I Jameson raiders to the Rennes court- |
i martial. But such diatribes do not i
I represent the popular feeling. If Presi- |
dent Kruger decides to hold his ground j
with the only means at his disposal,
that is. almost Immediate hostilities, he
, will find he has but small sympathy
from any class of British.
\ The Transvaal negotiations are now
i so long drawn out that though the pa
pers devote great space to them, popu
lar interest seems flagging. The Gov- (
ernment organs while regretting the at
titude of the Orange Free State point
out that its open hostility will even
tually prove advantageous in ridding j
Gerat Britain of the annoyance of j
having a presumably neutral but |
really hostile power so close to the
! scene of action, and enabling Great
I Britain to add the Free State to her
possessions without encountering for
eign protests or accusations of inhu
man aggrandizement.
CECIL RHODES MAKES
CHARGES OF TREASON
LONDON. Sept. 23.â A special dis
patch from Cape Town says: There
was an extraordinary scene in the As
3<=mbly Friday during the debate on the
registration of voters bill. Cecil Rhodes,
who hitherto has deprecated the advis
ability of hostilities, repeated the
statement that several members had
: accepted money for electioneering pur
: pesea from the Transvaal with which
i Fngland 13 now on the verge of war.
This statement created a great im
pression. Later, speaking on th 2 same
bill, Mr. Rhodes pointedly indicated
that some of the members were practi
cally guilty of treason; that they w?re
"supporters of a Ministerial party, wh.j
lived entirely on offal." and were noth
ing more than "political scavengers."
He called upon the Premier to hold
these in check.
SPECULATION ON THE
OUTCOME OF WAR
BERLIN, Sept. 23.â Experts are be
ginning to speculate on the probable
outcome of the war and the losses on
both sides. The Kreuz Zeltung says:
I "The British plan is an invasion on
three sides simultaneously from Rhode
sia, Natal and Mefeking or Kimberley.
The best and most effective part of the
English forces will probably be the vol
unteers raised in South Africa. There
are 7000 mounted men already in
Rhodesia, who, wiih other volunteers,
will be the real corps of the expedition."
In the Frankfort Zeitung General yon
Boguslawsky, a military' writer of note,
predicts that the British will sustain
enormous losses in the Transvaal, ow
ing mainly to the inferiority of their
officers and their inability to under
| stand or apply modern tactics.

BERLIN. Sept. 23.â An outbreak of j
war in the Transvaal is regarded here
as a question of a few days, or at the
most of weeks. The whole press de
votes considerable space to the matter.
Neither the attitude of the people or of ;
the press has changed materially. With
out exception they disapprove of such '
a war and blame Great Britain for ;
badgering, the Transvaal beyond en- j
durance.
The liberal press also blames the
Transvaal for its Illogical stand in first j
sanctioning Great Britain's attempts at j
interference in its internal affairs and
then rejecting such attempts and mak
ing thereof a casus belli. Thus argues
the Vossische Zeitung. Cologne Gazette. ,
Tageblatt and others. The whole* con- j
servatlve jingo, anti-Semite. Agrarian, :
ultramontaine and Center press sidÂ°s
with the Boers. The Kreuz Zeitung
says:
"No matter hnw things may develop j
It Is certain England is preparing for )
another act of brutal coercion."
The National Zeitung doubts whether j
it is still possible to adjust things in j
South Africa except by force of arms.
The Vossische Zeitung says: "War is ;
a foregone -conclusion. England Is only
delaying hostilities in order to gain
time to prepare a sufficiently large
army of Invasion. It will not be ready
until the middle of October. The Boers i
just now are stronger in a military
sense."
The Deutsche Tages Zeitung says:
"Germany unquestionably has the
strongest interest in maintaining the
independence of the Boer states, which
form a natural wall of protection
against the British possessions. The
people must demand that the Govern
ment vigorously protect these impor
tant interests. The only way to avoid
annihilation of the German colonies is
to get Germany. Holland and Belgium
to join In any direct emigration there,
especially to the Boer States."'
The Leipsic Neuste Nachrichten as
serts that if the Transvaal loses. Ger
man South Africa can no longer be
held. Great Britain then being enabled I
to isolate it economically until it be- j
comes worthless and drifts into English
hands, adding: "The Boers defend the j
advance post of German civilization
against Anglo-Saxondom and fight as
our advance guard."
The Deutsche Zeitung severely
blames the Government for its inac
tivity in the quarrel, saying: "This is
a dangerous game for German inter
ests."
In spite of these criticisms, many of
which are moÃt bitter, the Government
has not altered Its views or attitude.
This is evident from the inspired utter
ances of the Government press.
The Hamburger correspondent again
points out that Germany can only look
on in the struggle, adding:- "Germany
in this respect is situated precisely like
France, whose sympathies are with the
Boers."
I A Foreign Office official said to a cor
r*%pohdenr""heFe~. of v ~the ~ Associated
Press: "Of course it is in no sense to
our interest to have England and the
Transvaal go to war. That little Boer
nation will finally succumb and prob
ably will be wiped out of existence. It
is only too likely that this will dimin
ish our prestige in South Africa and in
jure our not inconsiderable interests
there, for our trade with the Boer
States is increasing and is only next to
that of England. Other interests will
also be jeopardized and injured in such
a struggle. Still there is no occasion
and no political or moral right for us
to interfere. So long as our undoubted
rights are respected by the belligerents
we shall not interfere." -
The informant of the correspondent
refused .to say whether it was a dis
tinct formal understanding with Great
Britain or whether the agreement of a
year ago on the subject of South Africa
included German neutrality in the
event of war in the Transvaal.

Recent Editorial Appearing in a
Prominent Journal Tend to
Such a View.
HAVANA. S^pt. 23.â Much comment has
been caused by an editorial article which
appeared in La Lucha to-day and which
may be taken, in connection with others
which have recently appeared in the
same paper, to mean that La Lucha is
beginning to favor an American protect
orate over the island. The editorial pays:
"The social and moral progress of Cuba
depends upon the island's wealth and fu
ture commerce, which is entirely in the
hands of the United States. If the Amer
ican colonies obtain preference in the
American market Cuba, however fertile
and rich she may be, will be unable to
sell her products and consequently will
be reduced to beggary. If the United
States open their markets to Cuba they
are bound to have compensation. The
people of Cuba should bear in mind the
fact that they cannot progress without
an American market."

DR. F. F. TEBBETS IS
CHARGED WITH CRIME
Is Accused by Dr, L. T, Cranz
of Selling Certificates,
State Board of Dental Examiners to Meet
in Special Session To-Morrow to Inves
tigate the Charges.
DR. LOUIS T. CRANZ is hot on the
trail of Dr. F. F. Tebbets of the
State Board of Dental Examiners.
He states that he is in possession
of absolute proof that the ac
cused member has ben using h!s posi
tion for illicit purposes for some time and
has been endeavoring to establish a traf
fic in illegal dental certificates, which he
offered to sell at prices ranging all the way
from $75 to $1000. The Governor will call
a special meeting of the board for
Monday to investigate the charges. Teb
bets will not be given a chance to resign,
and if the assertions against his honesty
in office are proven he will be summaniy
decapitated.
The exclusive publication in yesterday's
Call of the impending scandal was a
shock to the dental fraternity. The state
ment tha: influence had been brought to
bear on the Governor to save Tebbets' of
ficial head and that that pu'.l had de
terred the Chief Executive from acting
more promptly is emphatically deni' .
Dr. Cranz. He said:
"When I presented my formal charges
to the Governor he wanted to <.':.
Tebbets without any delay. He said that
a man who had done as he had done
would not stop at anything and that it
would not be safe to let him remain in
office. I pleaded for delay, to give me an
opportunity to complete the evidence in
the case and get certain testimony that
would establish guilt beyond doubt. That
evidence was secured yesterday and 1 at
once telegraphed Dr. Metcau at Sacra
mento to inform the Governor that I was
:â  â¢â¢:â¢.â  to proceed."
According to the statements made yes
terday by Dr. Cranz to a representative
of The "Call the Governor knew many
months ago that there was crook
in the State Board of Dental Examiners,
but he was unable to locate the guilty
parties. Cranz owed his appointment on
the board to the influence of Major Mc-
Laughlin and bad never met the Gover
nor previous to the time when the prize
was presented to him.
"At our first meeting." said Dr. Cranz,
"the Governor intimated to me that there
wa.Â« something wrong on the board and
that he looked to me to ferret it out.
Previous to my appointment I learned
that Dr. Tebbets was making Inquiries if
I was a man that could be reached. He
was told that 1 was not a drinking man
ar.d that did not seem to please him.
"After the last meeting of the State
Board adjourned we all went to a saloon
and while there Tebbets called me aside
and told me he had some important in
formation to communicate. I suspected
what was coming and put him off for a
few 'lays. In the meantime I told Major
McLaughlin of the occurrence and asked
his advice in the matter.
"I was told to lead Tebbets on and get
at the bottom of what he was dome.
Some days later I met Tebbets, and he
asked me if I was in for making some
big money easily. I told him that I was
and he said without any hesitation that
he had a man who was willing to pay
$1000 for a dental certificate. I agr

CHINESE TROOPS CUT
DOWN BY THE REBELS
Imperial Force Falls Into Ambush at
Saichau and Several Hundred Sol
diers Are Slain.
VICTORIA B. C. Sept. 23.â Oriental advices received by the Idsu Maru
to-night chronicle a sanguinary encounter between Chinese imperial
troops and the rebels at Saichau, the former being defeated with a
loss of several hundred warriors. Referring tn the meeting of the
rival forces, the correspondent on the field of the Hongkong Pres3
â wired as follows from Canton:
"The Nahoi Magistrate Yiang. sent tr> suppress the disturbance at Sai
chau and arrest the brigands, upon his arrival found his force not strong
enough and requested reinforcements. The Viceroy, in compliance, sent 300
men of the Ngai regiment, under Colonel Choi Chui. This force was con
veyed by four gunboats to Lokahwai, where they were to disembark and
march to Saichau, but when they landed they fell into an ambush. The
enemy was in strong force and had from forty to fifty pieces of artillery.
"A terrible fight ensued and several hundred were killed, the imperial
loss being far the greatest. Upon the news of the defeat of the imperial
troops being received by the Viceroy, his Excellency dispatched the black
flag chief. Liv Yung Fu. with his four regiments to the rescue. These [eft
on the 13th by the gunboats Kwong Yuen, Kwang Lee, On Ching, Kiungui
and Kwong On.
"The imperial troops already on the field have suspended operations
fnr the present, pending the arrival of the black flags. The brigands set
fire to nearly all the villages in the neighborhood, and 90 per cent of the
houses have been burned. This is intended to terrify the authorities."
Another correspondent wires: "Intelligence has been received in Can
ton of the disastrous and signal defeat of the imperial troops by the bandits
in the West River districts. A body of about 500 soldiers has, in effect, been
cut to pieces. About half the numbar were killed outright, and a majority
of the remainder wounded. The engagement took place at a place called
Colkow, on the West River, and the fight was fiercely maintained, the im
perialists being surprised and scouted. The rebels only lost about fifty or
sixty men. A fresh force, consisting of some 2<>oo men, has been dispatched
from Canton to suppress the insurrection. They are likely to find all their
work cut out for them."

Finmgan at San Jose. They represented
to me that they had been victims of Teb
bey?' crookedness. Tebbets admitted to
members of the State Board when they
cornered him on the proposition that his
actions as an official would not bear in
spection, and to Drs. Metcalf. Bachman
and Moore he promised to hand in his
resignation at once. This he failed to do."
The Governor does not appear to have
the same understanding of the matter as
Dr. Crar.z. The Governor insists that no
specific or formal charges were made
against Dr. Tebbets. as the following dis
patch from the capital shows:
SACRAMENTO, Sept. Governor
Gage was seen this afternoon upon his
arrival from lone by a reporter and asked
if charges had been filed against Dr. F.
F. Tebbets. member of the State Board
of Dental Examiners, and if so what dis
position had been made of the charges.
Governor Gage made the following reply
to the question: "I have heard that there
was trouble between Dr. Cranz and Dr.
Tebbets. My attention was directed to
statements and rumors against Tebbets,
but do written charges have been filed
with me. or, to my knowledge, at all.
"Those who have approached me on this
subject, and who have professed to have
knowledge, 1 have requested to make
written charges, If there were any
grounds for the same, and state the
grounds, so that I might have something
upon which to proceed. No written
charges have ever been filed by anybody.
"At the same time I am. and have been,
looking into the matter in my own way.
Written charges should always be filed
by those who know of wrong-doing in
any State institution or by any State
official, but If they are not filed I never
theless feel it my duty to investigate even
verbal charges if they emanate from an
apparently reliable source.
"I wish that justice may always be
done, and that the administration of State
affairs in all branches of S*ate govern
ment may be honest and clean. Dr. TÂ°b
bets was not an appointee of mine, but
of my predecessor. Governor Budd. Con
sequently I wish to proceed in this mat
ter very" carefully, that no imputation of
bias may attach to the proceedings. I
intend to probe the matter to the bot
tom, as I did the Agnews affair, but shall
be absolutely sure of my ground before
I act, and In no event take snap judg
ment.
"I have been carefully examining into
all branches of the State government,
whether charges have been preferred or
not, in order to ascertain if they are con
ducted in a businesslike manner and on
a correct basis; for I feel that to do this
has been intrusted to me by the people.
So far as it lies in my power the people
shall have a businesslike and honest ad
ministration in all State institutions and
State offices."

SMALL SICKNESSES.
Do Not Neglect Themâ They Often
Grow Into Larger Ones.
Piles are painful, persistent, hard to
cure, but they can be cured. There is just
one remedy that will do It. It is a recent
discovery, but it has been on the market
long enough to have the indorsement of
leading physicians and the recommenda-
tion of thousands of cured patients.
Pyramid Pile Cure acts quickly and di-
rectly. It cures the cause of the trouble.
Cures It so that the effect is permanent.
A great many salves and ointments will
give relief for a few mir.utes. That is not
what is wanted. Pyramid Pile Cure will
cure any sort of piles; blind, itching or
bleeding. It will cure the lightest or the
most aggravated case. The first applica-
tion will do more good than a dozen
boxes of any of the many of tho so-culled
cures now sold. Head these letters. They
are from people who havo tried it.
Mr. J. W. Rollins, a gentleman living at
Sweet Springs. Mo., writes briefly and to
the point regarding his experience with
Piles. He says: I consider the Pyramid
Pile Cure without an eQual. It cured me
in less than thirty days. I waited fifteen
days or more to be sure the remedy had
fully cured me before writing you. I can
now say I AM CURED and I shall recom-
mend the Pyramid Pile. Cure at every
possible opportunity because IT DE-
SKRVES IT.
Miss Easter Nunley of Tracy City,
Te.nn., writes: The Pyramid Pile Cure has
done my sister more good than anything
Bhe has ever taken I have nothing but
words of warm commendation for it.
From J. D. Roberts, Mount Moriah,
Mo.: I have used the Pyramid Pile Cure
and results havo been entirely satisfac-
tory- There can be no question but that
it Ik certain and lasting cure for pilesâ
at least it has so proven in my case.

PARIS. Sept. 23.â The proclamation
of the Minister of War. General de Gal

opposition among the Dreyfusards,
R idl< als and Socialists. It Is rumored
that an attempt will be made to oust

It is said he issued the proclamation
without consulting his fellow Ministers.
Snme of the papers criticising him are

Auxon River, an affluent of the Tthone,
near the foot of Mount Vintoux and about
fifteen miles from the famous city of

its soft, yet picturesque, beauty, as is
also its climate, than which there is none

The frightened driver was pulled from
his seat and the express box, which, it is

carried off. Â» ... , ,
The robbers sent the stage on with only
two horses, one of them being wounded.
They left the scene without taking to the
road, as it was easy to pass through the
brush and escape over the prairie.
Though only three presented themselves, ;

MRS. KNUDSON'S BODY
FOUND IN THE RIVER
The Supposition Is That She Com
mitted Suicide While Tempo
rarily Insane.
REDDING, Sept. 23.â The distracted rel
atives of Mrs. Louisa D. Knudson were
relieved to-day by the finding of the body
of that unfortunate woman in the river.
Even the knowledge of death itself was
a relief compared with the uncertainty
that existed concerning the lady's fate.
While suffering from temporary mental
aberration as the result of sickness and
worry Mrs. Knudson left her home on
Thursday, September 14. Since the night
of her departure she has never been seen
alive. She undoubtedly committed sui
cide by drowning.
A very thorough search was made for
the missing woman, but all to no avail
until Saturday afternoon when Carey
Chapman discovered the body floating
down the river at a point about two miles
below town. The sorrowing relatives havo
the evmpathy of the entire community.
The funeral will be held at 10 o'clock Sun
day morning and will be very generally
attended.

Buperior Court, has a communal college
with a large attendance of students; a
library of over 30,000 volumes, with some
$00 manuscripts, many of which are of
great rarity and the highest value.
Once a place of much political import
ance, it still holds a good place in manu
factures, embracing silk and cotton
threads and cloths, potteries, chemicals,
dye stuffs and leather, besides a large
trade in honey, wax, grain, fruit, trullies
and cattle, rivaling in extent that of its
larger neighbor, Orange, in spite of the
more advantageous situation of the latter.
The city, built in a fertile valley, is
watered by the Auzon River, which at
the same time furnishes tine water power
for its factories, and is overlooked by
Mount Vintoux, on which was established
some years ago one of the prjncipal sig
nal stations and observatories in the
south of France. All of which, besides its
historical associations, tend to make it a
place of Interest and enjoyment to the
weary man who there seeks shelter and
rest. It is one of the oldest cities in all
of France. Its origin and the time of its
foundation are not definitely known.
Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius
Caesar there existed on the site of the
present city another called Carpentoracte,
of which Pliny speaks under the name of
â Mt mini." In the course of time a
Roman colony grew up around the old
Gallic town, as a nucleus, which took the
name of Farum Meonis and in time be
came one of the richest and most import
ant places in all southern Gaul.
It was then taken and ravaged by the
Goths Vandals and Lambords in turn dur
ing the time of the decadence and final
dissolution of the Koman empire and
aealn later in the eighth century by the
Moors from Spain, when they overran the
! southern part of France, before being
hurled back by Charles Martel from the
bloody Held of Tours. When Clement V
an Aguitanian by birth, was invested
with the tiara, he transferred the Papal
court from Rome to Avignon and four
years later fixed his residence at Carpen

CITY OF MEXICO, Sept. 23.â A sensa
tional robbery took place yesterday in a
.suburb of this city. Guadalupe Vasquez.
an old woman 85 years of age, living with
her widowed daughter, was the victim.
The women were alone and employed no
servants, which is unusual in this coun
try among the people having property.
Every one thought them exceedingly poor,
but this was only apparent, for they had
a great sum of money in the house, there
being kept in a steel box no less than
$50 000 in bank bills, the proceeds of the
eale of a hacienda near this city. Be
sides this sum there were many thou
sands of dollars kept in the wardrobes,
in stockings or between the leaves of
books.
In some way news that the women had
a great amount of money got to the ears
of some men who came to the house and
hired a large corral at its rear tor the
purpose, she says, of keeping pigs. Their
purpose was robbery, ac now appears, and
yesterday morning, the mother being
alone in the house, these men came and
on the pretense of having a message to
deliver were let in by the old woman,
whom they seized and bound with ropes.
They then took the steel box with the
$50,000 and decamped, but omitted to search
for other money. The women, on being
interrogated by the police, said they had
heard that bank clerks had been stealing
money from banks, and they were afraid
to deposit their funds. Many arrests have
been made, and -tho police are confident
they have discovered the robbers.

the "Babylonish captivity." as it was
called, was spent by his successors
through the general influence of the free
men of the court and the strife and jeal
ousies engendered In the selection of new
Popes were rather hurtful to the perma
nent welfare of the city. About 1350 Car
pentras was visited by a very Disastrous
conflagration, which destroyed many of
its finest edifices. About 1358 Pope Inno
cent VI undertook to repair the damage
which had been done by the tire, but his
elaborate plans were never fully carried
out, as he died in 1362, and the great
schism following shortly after, attention
was distracted to political intrigue rather
than rebuilding the city. Some grand
works were, however, carried to comple
tion, especially the magnificent ramparts
by which the city was surrounded, a good
part of which is in evidence to-day. Ibe
walls were very high and massive, nearly
1 In the form of a square, on each comer of
which stood a strong round tower, /oiir
i gates, opening to the four points of the
i compass, gave passage in and out, each
i piercing through a massive round tower.
I except that of Notre Dame, opening
toward Orange, which had two towers a
hundred and fifteen feet in height. These
are still standing in good preservation
and are very noticeable for their massive
I structure and splendid battlements. Tnn
I parochial church, formerly a cathedral,
is a splendid specimen of the art of its
time. It was built by the anti-Pope Be
noit XIII in the latter part of the four
teenth century on the site of a former
church and dedicated to St. Siffrien, an
early Bishop of Carpentras. In this
church are six figures of the adoring an
fels. by Bernue, and a fine portrait of
t. Thomas Aquinas.
Adjoining the church is the Palace of
Justice, a structure of vast proportions,
built in IG4O by the famous Cardinal Bl
chi. then Bishop of Carpentras, as his
episcopal residence.
Carpentras has many fine promenades.
The one called the "Terrasse dcs Pla
tanes," overlooking the valley which
stretches between the town and Mount
Vintoux affords a panorama of beauty
and grandeur 6eldom to be found.
One of the most ancient as well as most
interesting sights about the city is the
Arch of Triumph of Carpentras, thought
by many to have been erected in honor of
Claudius, but assigned by others to the
time of Aurelian, and others yet to the
time of Dlo Cletian, 284-306 A. D. The
most noticeable structure of the whole
vicinity, however, is the very picturesque
aqueduct shown in the accompanying cut,
which supplies the city with potabla
water from the purest sources. It Is six
miles long and was built in 1720-34 at the
enormous cost for the time of 800.000
livres.
To the right of the aqueduct as it en
ters the city is the quarter where most of
the Jewish inhabitants, of whom Car
pentras has quite a number, live and do
business. They have a synagogue and
enjoy a freedom in regard to religion and
the education of their children not found
in many cities of lower France.

WAS DEVOID OF HAIR.
PECULIAR PLIGHT OF A SALEM
GIRL-ENTIRELY BALD.
What a Trial Package of a Remedy
Did for Her.
The portraits of Miss Emma Emond show
what a striking difference la made In a person
when the bald head Is covered with hair. Miss
Emond was totally hald. the hair follicles not
only upon her head hut upon her eyebrows be-
ing completely contracted, not the slgrn of a
hair being found. Of course she was the object
of many experiments, all of which failed, and
the offer of a well known dispensary to send a
free trial of their remedy was peculiarly allur-
ing to her. Bhe sent for the free trial, followed
all directions falthfullv and soon she was re-
warded by a growth of hair, which for thick-
ness, quality and luxuriance was as remark-
able as the result was gratifying. Mts9
Emond lives in Salem, Mass., at 276 Washing-
ton St., and naturally feels very much elated
to recover from total baldness. An itching
scalp to people who nre blessed with hair is a
sign of coming baldness and should be attended
to at once.
The remedy that mused Miss Emond's hair
to k'iiw *!â¢<> OUTM all nealp Itching and dls-
t>iii>fiÂ», removes dandruff and keeps the hair and
iÂ»oalp Itraithy and vigorous. Trial packages

bloodshed. It is now hoped that a cordial
understanding will soon be reached be

London bankers have arrived here with
Governor Gerningham cf Trinidad. They
hope to profit by the general panic and
to purchase railroads, tramways and

have proved successful.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 23.â At the re

I American representatives in V< neXuela
are to provide for the protection of Ger

country. This action is especially pleas
i ing to the authorities and is considered
\ another manifestation of the pood will of
. Emperor William toward the Itilted
I States. Several months ago the German
. Government requested the United States
p. pr,>vid>' protection for Its citizens and
their interests in the Philippines and
â  necessary instructions were cabled to
General Otis and tin? naval commander
in-chief. The German Government some
days ago received a cablegram from its
representative In Caracas requesting that

' there is no German man-of-war available
In those waters suiH the request that the
American representatives should take

Whether There Is Any Virtue
in Our Treatment for Catarrh,

"Dr. Fleckenstein, Parrott Building:, City-
Dear Doctor: How can I thank you for what
you are doing: for me? My hearing- is Improv-
, Ing so rapidly that everybody connected with
the school notices the improvement from day
to day. For twenty-Fix years I have steadily
grown harder of hearing, and when I consulted
you a few weeks ago I was almost totally deaf.
I had doctored continually for twenty-six years.
Some doctors said the general state of my
health was at fault. I tried all ' imaginable
remedies. I tried change of climate, change of
food, hot baths, cold baths, horseback-riding
and walking. My health Improved and my
deafness increased. After only three weeks'
treatment at your Institute I accompanied some
pupils to the theater, and to my great delight
found I could hear every word. The benefit
your treatment bestows on me Is already mak-
ing itself felt in my school, and It Is surely
making a new woman of me.

can express. Wishing you every success, I am,
respectfully yours. JEANNE BOLTE."

tary conditions or disturb the situation
they may land. The conditions in the
Philippines, it is pointed out, are such as
to make the entry of the Chinese labor
ens a disturbing element The I- HiPinoÂ»
are opposed to them, and there is a bit
ter feeling existing against the Chinese
n Â°U lV l believed here that if the United
States military authorities allow the Chi
net^ free acceilÃ to the Philippines it will
exasperate the people and tend to retard
tho pacification of the islands. This is
ore of the reasons given why it is neces
sary from a military standpoint to keep
thorn out. It has been represented how
ever by the Chinese Minister that the
landing of the 700 Chinese now at Manila
could do no harm and that to return them
to China would be a severe hardship. It
is this individual case which General Otis
Is to decide, but It Is well understood that
whatever Is done In this instance will have
no elfect in determining the other ques
tions presented by the Chinese upon the
general subject of exclusion. _ However,
It is understood that the military neces
sity of the case will determine what shall
bo done while the islands are under a
military government and the subject will
be handled from that standpoint rather
than with ?eference to the fact that a
Chinese exclusion law is in force in the
United States.

ing Up the Valuable Cali-
fornia Oil Properties.

for $5,000,000, has purchased outright for $1,000,000 the entire holdings and
assets of the Union Consolidated Oil and Transportation Company.

producing wells have already been located. Experts are now examining
other tracts, which, if reported favorably on, will be added to the above.
The capital stock of the American Company is $5,000,000, divided Into
500.000 shares, par value $10 each. Of this seven-tenths, or $3,500,000. has
been placed in the treasury for development purposes. This enormous
sum, sufficient for developments greater than those of any other ten com-
panies combined, guarantees to the investor no possibility of failure and
no possibility of assessments.

NO CONTEST ANTICIPATED
BULK OF THE ESTATE TO BE
HELD IN TRUST.
The Instrument Will Not Be Offered
/or Probate Until After the
Arrival of Alfred Q.
Vanderbilt.
Special DlÃi>atch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23.â From a reliable
eource a general outline of the will of
Cornelius Vanderbllt has been obtained.
According to this authority Mrs. Vander
bllt. under the terms of the document,
will receive a large annuity and use for
life of the family mansion at Fifth ave
nue and Fifty-eighth street, and of the
Breakers, in Newport. She also will re
ceive outright all the pictures, Bllver,
horses and carriages and perhaps a small
]> (racy.
Each of the five children will receive
probably $10,000,000 and the remainder of
the estate will be divided between the
two youngest sons, Alfred G. and Regi- :
nald. Cornelius Jr., the eldest son, there- '
fore will receive the same amount as is
given to his sisters, Mrs, Harry Pavne
â \Vhitney and Gladys. Mr. Vanderbllt
led in his will that the shares of the 1
two youngest suns and Gladys should re-]
main In tru^t until they have reached a !
certain age and that a trust fund also
should be created to provide for Mrs.
Vanderbllt's anruity.
William K. Vanderbllt, Chauncey M.
Depew and Edward V. Rosslter are
named as trustees and executors of the
estate. The will was. drawn by Mr.!
Vanderbilt and was modeled after that !
of his father. It is expected that there j
will be no contest and that no question I
about the document will be raised. It
la felt by long time friends of Mr. Vander- I
bIH that the will leaves no real gTound j
for a contest on the part of Cornelius Jr.
and It is also believed that his father-in
law. Richard T. Wilson, would not
countenance such a course.
It baa been d< elded not to offer the will
for probate, however, until after the re
turn of Alfred O. Vanderbilt. This will'
ne as a precautionary measure, In j
order that if any question should be ;
the whole matter can be settled be- 1
fore the will is offered for probate.
Every effort will be made to have the
Will presented in court with the approval
of all concerned, even if it becomes neces-
Bary to settle certain sums on persons
who may feel that they have not been
properly treated In Its provisions. At 1
ill- Fame time, there 13 not the slightest I
suspicion that any such point will be
raised.
latest estimates place the value of
Mr. Vanderbilt'a estate at from $100,000.
--fUS.O lie inherit! about $50,
--from his father. Among the hold
ings w:is a laree amount of Lake Shore

DUNSMUIR. Sept. 23.â The visiting
Eastern members of the American In
stitute of Mining Engineers have been
cordially welcomed by the California
Miners' Association, and this evening
the guests are resting at Castle Crag,
not far over the State line, enjoying
their first taste of California hospital
ity on their way to the annual meeting
in San Francisco.
The Jolly party of twenty offlcer3 and
members of the reception committee
woke up In their special car at Sun
Bonlto, in the upper Sacramento Val
ley, this morning, expecting to have
their car dropped at Montague to await
the special train bringing their guests,
scheduled to arrive there at 4p. m. A
report that the special was ahead of
time caused the stop to be made at
noon at Shasta Springs, fifty miles
south of Montague, and the restful wait
lasted until after 5 o'clock, when the
special of seven cars rolled along.
A hearty welcome was tendered the
1 i visitors without the formality of set
1 ' speeches. The reception committee \
'. ; wore beautifully designed badges of the '
1 ! seal of the Institute pendant from a
I ribbon, surmounted by a crossed pick ;
and shovel, and this badge was a suf- j
flcient Introduction and certificate of (
friendship to the g-uests, who trooped j
down the railroad track. The Califor
; nlans and Easterners fraternized auiet
j ly and quickly.
Rossiter W. Raymond, secretary of
the institute, and E. H. Benjamin, sec
retary of the California Miners' Asso
j ciation, quickly met, and then President
! James Douglas of the institute and
| President Neff of the association suid
â  a few nice things. Vice President W.
C. Ralston and the rest of the Calif* t
nia committeemen made themselves '
agreeable to the crowding ladies and i
gentlemen. Secretary Benjamin die- J
tributed badges to all the visiting party !
and otherwise busied himself with the i
' guests, who were escorted about the I
! springs and up the hill amid many ex- j
pressions of delighi. That was the â 
time and manner of California's initial
welcome to the American Institute of
Mining Engineers.
With the party from Montague came
John Daggett and A. G. Meyers, who,
with members of the Slskiyou County i
Miners' Association, went from Yreka j
to Montague to help in the Northern :
California welcome. President Doug- \
lap is a plain, quiet and affable old gen- ;
tleman, occupying a distinguished place |
in the mining field. Secretary Ray- i
mond, who has known the mineral re
sources of the West so thoroughly for
j more than a generation, was especially
I welcome to California,
It was soon found that several dis
i tinguifhed mining men whose presence
! was expected were not with the party.
j These are three university professors
of mining and metallurgy, Heinrich
Rles of Cornell, N. W. Lord of Ohio
State University and W. P. Blake, who
!is also president of the University of I
j Arizona. Among oth^r well known j
! men are David Williams of New York, ; '
I editor of the Iron Ape, and A. Thies
|of South Carolina. Two distinguished
] foreign members from Germany are
I seeing the mining resources of the
j country.
The party numbers fifty-nine, and
with two or three exceptions the men
of it are members of the institute oc
cupying various fields in the lines of
mining, metallurgy, geology, metal
\ manufacturing and so on. Aiter less |
I than an hour at Shasta Springs the |
i train boaring the special car of the
Californlans ran down to Dunsmuir
and then on to Castle Crag, where the
train will lay all night.
Early to-morrow the party will ar
i rive at Keswick, a little north of Red- j
i ding, and the day will be spent In vla
â  iting the big smelters of the Moun
tain Copper Comcany and Its mines !
ten miles away.
The company and citizens will pro
vide free hospitality. It is likely that
but a short stop can be made at Red
ding in the evening, and on Monday
morning the party will be In San Fran
cisco ready for the meeting and the
i round of pleasure there, and through
j the State.
The institute has held seventy-two ,
| meeting in all parts of the country but !
i the Pacific Coast since organization in
1871, and a number have been notable |
for interesting trips and lavish hospl- j
tality. "But*" declared President Doug
las, "none of its trips have approached I
this one in length and in delightful and !
profitable variety of experience. We
are anticipating a memorable time."
"We always expect the most of the
attendance at our meetings to come
from the general region in which they
the held," said Secretary Raymond,
"and I anticipate a good many mem
bers from Pacific Coast States. The
valuable features of our meetings are t
the papers and discussions and those
go promptly by publication to all mem
bers. We have had a very pleasant
trip across the continent, with many
invitations to stop for visits and expect
a delightful time In California."
The California miners do not gauge
j the Importance of the meeting and trip
with Its opportunities for hospitality
and advertising the State's mineral re
sources by the size of the party upon
which the effect Is not dependent.
Some of the ladies know a good deal
about mining and all wish to learn. In
cluding the young lady who asked a
gallant Californlan if there are any
trails in San Francisco.

VALUABLE TORPEDO
GOES TO THE BOTTOM
Divers Have Been Searching for it in
the Mud for Several
Days.
SAUSALITO, Sept. 23.â Property of Uncle Sam Jn the shape of a
torpedo valued at $3000 now lies in the mud at the bottom of the bay,
and for four days divers have been busily at work trying to recover
it The loss of the torpedo was due to a defect in the rudder at the
point, which caused the destructive missile to take an oblique course
and bury itself in the three feet of soft mud surrounding the spot
where the torpedo boat destroyer Farragut is anchored.
Last Wednesday morning the gunners aboard the Farragut were en
gaged in practice work and sent an 18-foot torpedo out of one of the
tubes, set for five feet under the surface of the water and primed for
800 yards. A hundred yards away from the boat bubbles rose to the
surface, caused by the compressed air escaping from the torpedo. This
showed the experienced gunners that it had taken a downward course.
A boat was lowered and a buoy anchored over the spot so as to deter
mine where the torpedo lay. Since then three divers have been con
stantly searching for the $3000 missile, but they are handicapped ow
ing to the mud making the water opaque at every step, and have to poke
around with steel rods in the hope of discovering its location. Lieuten
ant Commander Nicholson is confident that the torpedo will be recov
ered in a few days.
COMPROMISE WITH
MRS. EMMA PARKER
Will Receive About One-Third of the
Estate of Her Father-in-
Law.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 23.â Thn heirs of
George H. Parker, the eccentric old cap
italist, who left an estate valued at $300,
--000, have compromised with Mrs. Emma
L. Parker, who contested dece<lent's will.
Mrs. Parker 1? the widow of Edward L.
Parker, only son of the testator, who
died a few months after his father. By
the terms of the will he was given JIO.OoO
and the Income on the property at 1122
Market street, San Francisco, during his
lifetime. In case of his death nothing
was tv go to his widow. His death fol
lowed so closely on that of his father
that he received nothing at all. After a
few minor bequests Parker gave the bulk
of the property to Marshall and Jane
Pomeroy, relatives by marriage, and their
five children.
Mrs. Emma Parker began a conte?t,
claiming that Parker was of unsound
mind and that he had been Influenced by
the Pomeroys. There were three trials
of the contest and the fourth was about
to begin. The first one resulted in the
will being set aside and the other two In
d i Ba Â£ reem ents.
Plans looking to a compromise have
been in progress for some time and arc
now about completed. It Is said Mrs.
Parker will receive about one-third of
the estate, or property valued at between
$20,000 and $30,000.
SUPERVISORS OF YOLO
FAVOR ROAD SPRINKLING
Portion of the Elkhorn and Sacra-
mento Road Used as an
Object Lesson.
WOODLAND, Sept. 23.â The Indications
are now favorable for road sprinkling in
Yolo County next year. The Supervisors
have inspected a section of the- Klkhorn
and Sacramento road which has been
sprinkled for the past six weeks. The re
sults have been satisfactory and the ex
pense is so reasonable that a majority of
them are now convinced that in the in
terest of health, comfort and economy it
will be best tr> sprinkle the main thor
outrhfnres of the county.
They have already given an option to
tho Studebaker Company to construct sev
eral wagons for delivery next June, and
Byron Jackson will probably furnish the
pumps ajid other necessary appliances.
The people of Yolo County are well
pleased with the unexpected turn the
sprinkling proposition has taken.

VETERANS WILL
BE IN LINE
Decision of Officials
Ignored.
WILL DO HONOR TO DEWEY
POSITIONS IN THE PARADE AC-
CORDED OFFICERS.
Admiral Schley Is Last of All, But
He Declares That He Has Not
the Slightest Com
plaint.
Breclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23.â Veterans of
the Civil War will participate In the
land parade in honor of Dewey, despite
the decision of the officials of the
Grand Army of the Republic not to
order out the different posts. Amon?
the organizations which have decided
to parade are two platoons of the
Medal of Honor Legion under com
mand of General T. S. Peck of Burling
ton, Vt. Those who will parade will be
largely members of the New York
Commandery, but other commanderles
will be represented. All these men are j
members of the Grand Army. The ;
Loyal Legion has nominated several of
its staff to parade. There will be two
organizations, numbering 100 men, of
the Duryea Zouaves of the One Hun- '
dred and Sixty-fifth New York Volun
teers. There will be a contingent from
the Eleventh Veteran Association of
the Civil War. The Hawkins Zouaves
and two full Grand Army of the Re- (
public posts have arranged to take part 'â 
in the parade. Already 500 veterans
have decided to parade, and by Tues
day it is expected that 1200, the limit
set by General Roe, will have Bent in !
applications.
The Confederate Veterans, who had
also decided not to parade, are now
arranging to have a representation of
their organization in the parade.
Almost a week in advance of the [
Dewey celebration, New York is rap
idly filling up with visitors. Broadway
was to-day almost Impassable and
Street car lines were frequently
blocked. Fifth avenue, for nearly its [
entire length, is a mass of stands in (
various stages of construction. Car- i
penters were putting up a stand yester- I
day in front of the First Presbyterian
Church, at Twelfth street and Fifth '
avenue, while a sign announced that
seats might be engaged by applying at
the church. Prices asked by stand
speculators are high. At one stand
near the arch $20 to $25 a seat is de
manded. The lowest figures at which
seats in Fifth avenue are quoted is $3. j
These are on stands below Twenty
third street, and where a seat-holder
will not be able to see Admiral Dewey,
who leaves the parade at the reviewing
stand.
There is still much work to do on the i
arch and colonnade. Sculptors and !
modelers are doing all in their power I
toward completion. The mammoth j
sign, "Welcome Dewey," on Brooklyn \
Bridge, is being put together as fast as !
the carpenters and electricians can do ;
it. Several of the letters have been j
finished and these were lighted up last j
night and tested.
Hear Admiral Schley's place in the !
naval contingent of the land parade
was settled to-day by Rear Admiral
Philip, to whom a sub-committee of re
ception appealed for advice. Admiral
Philip suggested as in accord with
every requirement of official etiquette !
the following formation:
Sousa's band: battalion of sailors j
from the Olympia; Admiral Dewey and
Mayor Van Wyck; Dewey's five cap
tains at Manila; personal staff of Ad

Admiral Phillip subsequently said
that Admiral Schley had told him that
he was perfectly satisfied with the
foregoing formation and that It was ac
cording to naval rules.
Some disappointment is expressed by
the officers of Rear Admiral Sampson's
squadron over the failure to provide
seats for their use on the city stands to
witness the Dewey land parade. As
they will participate in the naval par
ade and many of them will march with
their men in the land procession they

ADDITIONS TO THE
PERSONAL PROPERTY ROLL
EXPERT PLATT FILES REPORTS
TO SUPERVISORS.
California the Only State Allowing
National Bank Stocks to Go
TJntaxed.
Expert Alfred O. Platt filed his report
of personal property placed on the as
sessment roll of this city and county for
the year 1599 with the Board of Super
visors yesterday. The total increase over
the assessment of last year, he states,
amounts to $52,707,554. Quasi public cor
porations are increased $19,507,859, banking
institutions $20,318,602. All this amount is
now being litigated in the courts.
In 1898 the ratio of personal property
to the total assessment was 19 7-10 per
cent. This year it is 29 3-6 per cent, being
thÂ« second highest percentage attained by
any city in the United States, thirty of
the larger cities showing an average of
less than 14 per cent.
Regarding the assessment of bonds and
shares of national bank stocks, which
question iÂ» now before the Supreme
Court, the Attorney General in his brief
affirms that California occupies the
unique distinction of being the only State
that has heretofore allowed this class of
property to go untaxed.
According to sworn statements made to
the Bank Commissioners within two
hours of noon on the first Monday in
March, the amount of money on deposit
with commercial banks in this city
amounted to $43,666,090. The provision In
section 3617 of the Political Code ex
pressly requires that money on deposit
with savings and loan corporations shall
heassessed to the corporation with whom
it is deposited, but strangely permits
commercial banks to deduct such deposits
from their assets as a debt due bona fide
residents of this State.

State Campaign Opens
at Akron.
LARGE CROWDS ARE PRESENT
P.OOSEVEI.T URGES SUPPORT OF
THE A TWTXISTRATION.
Appeals to All People Irrespective of
Party to Uphold the Honor of

SsacfÂ»l riiixi.'h to The Call.
AKRON'. Ohio, Sept. 23.â The Repub- i
lican State campaign waa opened hers ;
to-day with onÂ« of the largest crowds
known In thÂ« history of politics in ;
Ohio.
Judff- Nash arrive ! from Columbus
â¢â " * o'clock in the morning, accom
panied by his daughter. Mrs. Babcock.
Colonel Charles Dick. Secretary of
State Kiniey, Auditor of StaU Gilbert j
and Hon. H. M. Daugherty, who was '
Ins leading opponent for the nomina- |
tion before the Columbus convention, j
Governor P*oosevelt and his escort, the ;
Tlppecanoe Club of Cleveland, did not j
arrive until after 13 o'clock. An im- j
xnÂ«nsÂ« crowd greeted them at the sta- J
tlon, and the party was taken to the J
Kctel Buchtei. From here Judge Nash. j
Governor Roosevelt, Senator Banna.
Colonel Dick and other distinguished j
guests went to the Elks' clubrocms, j
where they ate dinner with the news
paper men. This waa an entirely non- j
partisan affair.
The parade began at 2 o'clock. It was j
in six divisions and in charge of Cap- j
tain A. "Wagner as general marshal. ;
There were 15,000 men in line. The j
moat conspicuous features were the es
corts of Colonel Roosevelt and Judse '
Nash, the one of the veterans of the
Spanish- American war and the other j
of the veterans of the Civil War. The ]
meeting was held at Grace Park, with- |
In whose confines fully 75,000 people j
gathered, only a small portion of whom
could get within ranje of the voices
cf the speakers. Jud?e N. B. Tibballs
presided; President Ira Priest cf Buch- j
tel offered prayer, and the Columbus
Glee Club of 100 voices sang:.
Judge Nash was the first speaker, j
He concluded as follows:
"Within the last few years many of the
business men of this country have con
solidated their great interests Into cor
porations and combinations, which are
popularly known as "trusi3." Tha men
fwho conduct our manufactories, trade
and commerce are generally intelligent; j
I far-seeing citizens, with patriotism
equal to that oÂ£ any Other cia^s ol cm-
B*ns. I am very loth to believe that
th-jae men would knowingly do anything j
that would be detrimental to the coun- ;
try or their fellow men. It is true, how- !
ever, that there are things connected with j
these new organizations that need tegu- j
lauon by law, in order to prevent evils
which niay arise.
Undoubtedly careful and wise legisla
tion will bÂ« required both on the part of
Congress and the State Legislature to
rsguiate and prevent evils which may
emanate from the large corporations, j
Such legislation we can safely entrust to
the men of the Republican party.
At the conclusion of Judge Nash' 3
ep^ech Governor Roosevelt was intro
duced, and he spoke at considerable j
length. After indorsing the policy of j
the national administration in regard \
â thii . Phiip pines. .Governor Roosevelt
concluded with these words:
}Jy fellow citizens, this contest oÂ£ yours
In Ohio is no more a. State contest. It i 3 [
a national ccntest. Our opponents aro ;
fighting on national grounds. They taK.a i
their stand in favor of economic unrest, I
of financial dishonesty and of national j
dishonor. We take up the glove that they :
throw down. We meet tnem on every j
point. "We stand for a continuation of tha j
conditions which have brought prosperity
to us. We stand for an intelligent effort
to wipe out any wrong that may arise i
without substituting a tenfold greater j
evil. Finally, we stand for upholding the
traditional American policy of defending
the honor of the American people in the
face of any foreign foe and of i
giving' free outlet to- the vigorous j
and abounding strength of the na- .
tion. If we flinch from doing our
task in the face of the nations, if we
See from the Philippines, we shall have
written a shameful page In the history j
cur country, a tag- ; which our sons and â 
rrar..isor.a will read with bowed heads. I j
verily believe that the shame and angnr i
much action would, arouse in our bosoms [
would force us in a few brief year 3 again
to tread the path upon which we have
row entered: only the delay would in
crease beyond measure the difficulty and
dar.ger. "CVe cannot shrink from, doing the ]
task allotted to us, unless we are content
to see it dene by stronger hands and to
admit that we are not in the first rank
among nations. Surely no American
â worthy the name will make such an ad
mission. In the present crisis ire appeal j
rot merely to party but beyond party; J
â wÂ« appeal to all good citizens, to all pa- i
trlotic Americans, to stand with us as |
â¢we uphold nnar.cial integrity and the con- i
iitiens which make for material prosper
ity at home, as we uphold the honor â  *
t e e T. 3.% and the interests of the nation
abroad.

BURDENED women. I
We look in amazement at the burdens j
tome women carry upon their heads.
Yet how light they are compared with
the hardens some women carry upon
their hearts. There are childless women
-whose hearts ache ceaselessly because of j
the childless home. That* burden of j
childlessness has been lifte^. from the j
heart of many a woman by the use of j
Dr. Pierce Favorite Prescription. Many i
of the obstacles to maternity are renov- j
able. Such obstacles are entirely re- 1
moved by Favorite Prescription." It

ROWLAND OFFERS
HIS RESIGNATION
â¢ â 
Finds It Impossible to
Cover His Territory.
â¦ '
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA. Sept. There is doubt
whether Ward B. Rowland of this city
will act as the State Dairy Board i in
spector Dr. Rowland says many cattle
ax* undoubtedly affected with Texas fe
ver in this section, and he cannot cover
the territory which the board demand*
he shall cover. He supposed that this
county would be his field. The sum of
$300 was set aside for his use up to De
cember 31. This will not enable him to
hire an assistant, and now the board in
fo-ms him his territory Includes all
Southern California, except a portion of
Â£i Af*er Yeceivinsr this information he
wrote to the State Board that bis com
mission and papers were at its disposal.
He was urged by the ecretary of the boaru
?Â« do tn? best he could. It is evident that
the north does not realize how prevalent
the disease 13 among the cattle in the
south. The diseas* of Texas fever came
here from Kansas and is introduced to
cattle through the medium of a tick. A
short time ago a bushel of these ticks
wa3 taken from a herd. Recently a
rancher from the north. 127 of whose cows
died was informed that the disease was
Texas fever. The rancher did not know
what his cowr died of.
ThÂ» fever la believed not to bÂ« communi
cated by the milk to human beings, but
few people like to take milk that comes
from diseased cattle. Dr. Rowland says
he has no doubt that much milk Is being
sold here from infected cattle. He is will
ing to answer complaints, but cannot
mm- thÂ« territory to inÂ«T>ect Cattle.
GRAIN CROP HEAVY.
Transportation Companies at Stock-;

STOCKTON, Sept. 23.â The county roads
are lined with heavy wagon trains haul
lr.g grain to Stockton. From appearances
on the water front, the alarm about the
discrimination in favor of Port Coeta was
needless* It Is reported that some of the
local warehouses have already closed
down, and cannot accept another sack of
{Train. Grain Is even beine stored In bams
and improvised sheds. The crop is what
may i"-Â« termed tremendous.
A report from Roberts Island, the great
grain-producing district, says that all of
the grain on the upper division Is either
thrashed or In sack, having been cat with
iica-iiers. On the middle division, however,

HAWAIIAN LABOR.
/""Â» OXTRACT labor is being landed in Hawaii by
( hundreds, in addition to the thousands that have
been received since the islands came under the
liction of the United States.
The British tramp steamer Victoria was taking on
id of contract laborers at Madeira when the
American Consul, Mr. Tones, served notice on the
â¢ Hawaii had been annexed to the United
d, under the laws of this country, their con
are void. This deterred about half of them
embarking. The charter party of the steamer
a protest against the Consul's action, and pre
[ it at Washington through the British legation.
'J lie result was an investigation by our Government
which resulted in reversing the Consul, and now there
images against the United States by the
ts of the ship.
The laws of the United States forbid contract la-
It is a form of involuntary servitude, and that
: 'lidden by the constitution "in the United States
or any place under their jurisdiction." The Consul
seems to have labored under the impression that the
constitution and laws are to be respected and en
forced by the public officers chosen and sworn for
that purpose. Surely it is time to take an observa
tion and find our exact political latitude and longi
tude. With polygamy and slavery under our flag and
jurisdiction in the Sulus and involuntary servitude by
contract labor flourishing in Hawaii, and eight hun
dred thousand dollars a day being spent in a war
not declared by Congress, there seems to be some
support for General Merritt's declaration that the
country has outgrown the constitution.
Recently the lightship, anchored off the heads to
quids vessels into the harbor of San Francisco, was
brought in?ide the bay without notice to mariners. It
is the season of fog off shore, and ships arriving tried
to find the lightship. Some of them nearly struck
above Point Bonita and some narrowly escaped
wreck below Point Lobos, They missed the familiar
lightship and sailed ahead with a feeling of safety
in the belief that they were still far off shore. The
constitution is the lightship which guides our ship
of ttate. If it is withdrawn, by what is the state to
be gtiided? There are sho.als and rocks and bars to
be avoided. What shall mark them and by what shall
the ship be steered?
The Republican party does not wish to be made
responsible for the present plan of navigation by
"dead reckoning." It will certainly protest against
responsibility for what may follow. It will refuse to
be put in the attitude of indorsing polygamy and
slavery and contract labor. It is this aspect which
generally disquiets the party, while it loyally sup
ports the administration in doing all that lies within
its constitutional power to end the painful situation
in the Philippines, but the party has its own future
and usefulness a^d its duty to the republic to con
sider.
When Consuls are turned Sown for deciding that
the laws of the United States must be respected, and
our Government incurs a Hnim for damages by void
ing it* own lawsf there arise responsibilities which
the parly wiil refuse to bear.
Since the political management of William F. Her
rin has proved unsatisfactory to his employers some
of his friends might suggest to a theatrical magnate
that Wi'liam possesses certain qualities which might
qualify him to become a successful stage manager.
Or perhaps he might shine better in a circus.
Jimenes was received In San Domingo with some
thing like an ovation, but it appears his followers did
their shouting before the right time. An opposition
has arisen, and as the army has not received from
Jimenes Hie pay it counted on there is danger it will
join the revolution.
Now that an actress has shot a stage manager for
calling her an "amateur" it is pertinent to inquire
whether the professional ethics of the stage' would
have justified the manager in shooting her if she
had been an amateur.
It is about time to establish a close season for
Southern Pacific accidents. The killing threatens to
reduce the population too much.
THE BY-ELECTIONS.
THE condition of parties in the States which vote*
next November is such as to excite the interest
of partisans and to rouse the thought of political
philosophers. The Republican convention in
Nebraska has followed the example of all that pre
ceded it in other States, in careful abstention from
any indorsement of imperialism, temporary or per
manent. They uphold the President in the military j
effort to maintain such authority in the Philippines j
as the treaty of Paris conveyed, but this is done in the j
spirit of the Senate resolution explanatory of its
' ratification of that treaty, which declared that pcrma-
J nent occupancy of the Philippines was not intended
i thereby. It is easy to see that the Republican party
: has adopted the Fabian policy and proposes to wait
upon events and hold itself in a position to bring
influence to bear upon the next session of Congress.
The Bryan Democracy is blindly clouding counsel i
by an tndiscriminating assault upon the administra
tion, and is just now, by epithet and invective, doing I
for imperialism the same service tlvat was rendered j
I anti-imperialism by the attacks of Merritt, Reid and ,
i others upon the constitution and the Declaration of !
{ Independence. The Republican party everywhere ;
I seems to be keeping its head cool and its feet warm, \
! while in temperature its enemy has changed ends, and :
I is marching on cold feet and with hot head to an
assault that will but little benefit it next year.
In many of the States both parties are distressed by !
factions which are especially active. In Kentucky the
j Democrats are at each others' throats with tooth and i
! claw, and in Ohio the Republicans are not much bet- '
| ter off. The Southern Democracy is very tired of
' Bryan and wants to unload him. For that the Sara
'â â  toga conference was called, and for that the word
: has been passed throughout the South, and there has
followed a general feeling of unrest. Such men as !
; ex-Senator Faulkner of West Virginia, Gorman of
Maryland and Scott Ilowell of Georgia are weary of
' Bryan's leadership, and some of them show signs of
intending to fall in behind Henry Watterson and Sen
ator Morgan 'in the indorsement of imperialism as an
open reason for antagonizing the Nebraskan. Among
these has lately been lighted a new hope. If Kentucky
go Republican in November it will furnish the South
a pretext for repudiating Bryan and save it the neces
sity of openly supporting imperialism for that pur
pose. This, seeming to be well understood in
Kentucky, is what puts such serious weight into the
bolting candidacy of John Young Brown against
bel, the regular nominee. The crux of the Re
publican situation is in Ohio. That State is the ancient
hotbed of faction in both parties. The Democracy
was long torn into tatters by fhe feud between Wash.
I. can and Senator Thurman. McLean was an
intriguer of rare ability. Thurman had stood in the
Senate for sound money in the time when the green
back storm was a political blizzard. He had as thor
oughly identified himself with sound money as did
Cleveland and Carlisle later on. But Thurman was
ambitious to succeed himself. He was getting old,
r.nd to found out his life and end it in a Senatorial
j career, which for a Western Democrat must be the
j first in duration and importance since Thomas 11.
I Benton, became his dearest wish. Wash. McLean
j had always fought him, but now he appeared
;as a friend and tempter. If Thurman would go to
i Ohio and make a greenback speech he should be
| Senator and succeed himself. The ambitious old man
took the bait, and in his speech at Wooster swallowed
jit and the hook and himself. He was beaten and
dropped into the ranks of the "old Romans," the
I American euphemism for old has-beens.
Since then the party in Ohio has been wandering
around without its head, an object of pity, indigent
and incapable of self-supp'>rt. But this year it has
found "an angel" in John R. McLean, old Wash's
son, and for the first time in many years its hoop?
seem to be tight.
Strangely enough, or naturally enough, a? one may
look at it, just a? the Ohio Democracy i- showing
signs of union and strength, Ohio Republicanism,
which had trotted along smoothly enough, breaks,
goes off its feet and is biting its own thumb at itself.
Jonesism in Toledo, the street railroad strike in
j Cuyahoga County, and McLean's influence in Hamil
| ton, present a vexatious situation to torment the Re
; publican managers. As if this were not enough, the
! chronic temper of Senator Foraker is apparent in the
situation. It is known that in 1896 the State was long
j in doubt, and it is believed to have been saved by
the gold Democracy, and it is also known that For
aker's friends would not have worn the usual badge
of mourning for thirty days if it had not been saved
at all.
If there is not some balm for the party feuds this
! year it is not impossible that Democratic Ohio may
salute Republican Kentucky across the Ohio River.
Then what? That such a result would profoundly
affect the attitude of each party toward its present
leadership there can be no doubt, and so there can be
1 no doubt that the general result of the by-elections
will leave the Republican party as firmly entrenched
I as ever, and then the wisdom of its conservatism on
! imperialism will be manifest.
The Sheriff of Santa Gara County admits he can
not find Dunham nor the skeleton whose discov-erv
was reported, but he claims to have found the spot
where the bones lay, and counts that as a clew.
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS.
NOT long ago the United States Investor di
rected attention to the decadence in banking
which is taking place in the country districts
of the East, and now the New York Times points
out that there has been a movement among the
larger banks of that city to establish branches in for
eign countries to facilitate our expanding commerce.
The two items taken together show a tendency in
financial as well as in commercial and industrial
circles toward the expansion of large institutions at
the expense of small ones.
In reviewing the decline in the country banks of
the Eastern States the Investor attributes it to a
growing disinclination on the part of the managers
of such banks to discount mercantile paper and a ten
dency to loan only on collateral security. The new
course is regarded as an evil to the community, since
the average merchant or manufacturer in the country
districts has no collateral. Such money as he owns
is invested in business. What he borrows upon is
his standing in the community, his business ability
and his integrity. His energy and his work are, more
over, prime factors in building up the community in
which he lives and in giving employment to its labor.
When the banks refuse loans his business is crippled
and the locality suffers. The evil is made worse by
the fact that the money of the country banks, being
no longer used at home, goes to the cities, whefe
capitalists who have collateral make use of it for the
purpose of promoting great" undertakings, many of
which are wholly speculative.
It is probable that the drain of money in that way
from the country districts to the great centers is what
produces the congestion of capital in those centers
and e-ngenders that spirit of spec^ation which of late
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 24. 1899.
has been so marked in the purchase of shares in in
dustrial trusts of almost every kind. It may also
account for the facts that we have been lending
money to Europe and that the larger bankers of the
East purpose to open branch banks in foreign coun
tries for the purpose of finding employment for their
capital.
What is noted here as merely the beginning of a
movement toward the upbuilding of great banks at
the expense of small ones is a tendency which in
Great Britain has already reached a point where it
has become a widespread evil. About a year ago the
London Chronicle published an elaborate series or
papers on the subject, and in the course of them
stated that while a capitalist who wished to borrow
a million pounds could get it at lower rates
of interest than were ever before known, yet the
tradesmen and smaller manufacturers of the king
dom could hardly get money at all. So great had
the evil become that in many cases the large manu
facturers were forced to borrow money in large sums
and divide it in loans to the retailers who handled
their goods. In other cases co-operative borrowing
societies were formed among tradesmen and small
manufacturers to obtain money for their business.
It is well to have this tendency of the time pre
sented now, before it reaches in this country anything
like the point it has attained in Great Britain. Our
local industries are too valuable to be subjected to the
double danger of being crushed by great trusts and
stifled by a lack of financial advantages. The issue
will come before Congress when it undertakes the
work of currency reform, and care should be taken at
that time to provide that ample banking facilities be
given to every district of the country.
CALIFORNIA has for the members of the In- j
stitute of Mining Engineers a welcome more
than usually warm. The foundation of the
State was laid by miners, in the most romantic and
adventurous period of its history it was under the
control of miners, most of the fortunes of the early
days were gathered from the mines, and to this day
mining constitutes one of its most important indus
tries.
The miners who are now to visit us are very differ
ent from the adventurous men who came to work the j
placers in the days of old. They are not men who
take chances. They are men of science. Their work
in the mines is based upon a foundation in which luck j
and fortune cut but a small figure. It is constructed j
of all that human learning has gained from experience
in mines in every part of the globe and from experi
ments in the laboratories of the civilized world. 1
They are better fitted to appraise the worth of our i
mining resources than any other body of men in the 1
country, and it is because of their ability to appreciate
the mineral stores of our rich commonwealth that we
so highly appreciate them.
The members of the mining institute are not them
selves investors in mines to any great extent, but they
are the authorities and experts whom the mining cap
italists consult and by whose advice they are guided in
making investments. Such reports as they make of
our developed and of our undeveloped resources of
mineral wealth will be of vast importance to us. They
are not idle holiday seekers who are here for pleasure
merely, but guests whose purpose is the acquirement
of knowledge as well as the enjoyment of such enter
tainments as we may provide, and therefore are
doubly welcome to a State whose people even in their
moments of recreation are alive and alert to the great
i*sue of advancing the material welfare of their com
monwealth.
THE NEW ENGLAND COTTON
INDUSTRY.
SOUTHWARD the New England cotton mills
take their way. and unless some means be found
to prevent, it is probable that within a com
paratively few years the yrent bulk of the cotton
cloths of the country will be manufactured south ot
the Potomac and the Ohio.
The drift of the nulls away from New England has
long been noted, and in that section has been studied
with considerable care. For a time it was believed
the Southern mills would never be able to compete
with New England in the manufacture of any except ;
the coarser fabrics, but that belief, which was founded
on hope rather than on reason, has proved fallacious. |
Some of the biggest mills in New England engaged .
in manufacturing the best class of goods have moved
south, and the end is not yet. According to late re
ports arrangements arc being made for the removal |
of the Springvale Cotton Mills (Springvale, Maine) i
to Fort Valley, Georgia. This will be the second
migration from York County, Maine, the first being i
that of the plant and business of the Portsmouth Cot
ton Mill of South Berwick, about a year ago. The
Springvale mills operate 300 looms and 10,500 spin- â 
dies, making sateens principally.
The economic forces that draw the mills to the
I South are many, and in the aggregate constitute a j
i great power. The Southern mills have newer and J
better machinery than those of the North; they get
i the raw material cheaper, because the cost of trans
portation is less; they obtain cheaper labor, because
the cost of living is less in the South than in New j
j England: and in addition to these natural advantages
i on the part of the South there are others of legisla
tion not less effective. Competition and high taxes
are driving the mills from New England, and induce
'â  ments in the shape of remission of taxes for a long
1 period of years, grants of land (in some cases free of
cost), free water rights, etc., are attractive forces
which are drawing the evicted mills toward the South.
It is a significant fact, not generally known, that
many of the largest, newest and finest cotton mills in
the South have been erected with New England capi
tal.
As a means of counterbalancing the advantages of
the South and thus preventing what threatens to be a
wholesale migration of the cotton industry south
ward, some New England capitalists have suggested
the advisability of organizing a great trust to operate
[ the mills of that section. The scheme has been much

i virtually accomplished in all essential matters and is

the greatest of New England industries.
To form the purposed trust will require a capital
;of $150,000.000 â or, at least, that is the amount of
capital stock suggested for the enterprise. Comment
ing upon it. the New York Tribnne says: "The
â  theory is that a centralized management will not only
; get rid of all sorts of leaks and weaknesses resulting
from local influences, but will effect radical and long
1 needed improvement in methods and machinery, being
no longer restricted by desire to earn dividends on the
plants which need reconstruction, and will stop the
I competition which has been found destructive.
' Whether the man or men can be found who have the
faculty or the strength to accomplish what the best
' men in the business have failed to accomplish Is of
I course the question on which everything depends, and
j which no theory can possibly answer."

Yachtsmen, and, indeed, all lovers of
sporting events, will be well pleased to
learn that Captain Evans of the United
States navy has been detailed to patrol
the course in the coming race between
the Columbia and the Shamrock, and
that for the performance of the work
he is to have under his command "a
small squadron of revenue cutters and
other light naval craft."
The supervision of the race by an offi
cer of such rank and of the well-known
firmness of Captain Evans will assure
fair play for the yachts. He can be re
lied upon to keep the course clear and
to prevent any interference on the part
of excursion steamers or pleasure boats
of any kind that may go down to see
the sport.
That much is excellent. There is,
however, an after thought sure to rise
sooner or later in the minds of reflect
ing citizens. Why should a naval offl
| cer of Evans' rank be deputed with a
number of United States cutters to at
tend a yacht race?
The Prince of Wales is a yachtsman
in Great Britain, and yacht races there
j have been interfered with by steamers;
j but as yet his Royal Highness has
I never ordered a British naval officer to
attend his sports. Kaiser W T illiam is a
yachtsman, and he also has known ex
cursion steamers to crowd the course of
the yacht races in Germany: still there
j has never been any report of the Kaiser
! detailing a squadron from his navy to
! supervise them.
We are getting a nice little display of
imperialism in this performance. If the
navy can be used to promote the sports
of millionaires on the sea, why should
not the army be used to attend their
sports on land? Golf clubs frequently
complain of trespass on the part of the
country folks, and farmers have been
known to interfere with the noble sport
of fox-hunting or chasing the anise
seed bag. Why not detail General Shaf
j ter with a squadron of cavalry to at
tend the games at Burlingame, or send
General Merritt to lackey the amuse
ments of Newport? The thing is feas-
J ible. Sincp we are to have imperial
1 sports under the patronage of the Gov
| eminent and at the expense of thf> na
'. tion. let us do it in th** fashion of old
i Rome and provide for military guards
i on land as well as naval escorts on the
j sea.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Tho office, the dignity and the re
; sponsibilitles of the position of admiral
I of yacht racing will probably not be
! displeasing to Captain Evans, for
"Fighting Bob." as a devotee of rod
'â  and gun, is in all likelihood a votary of
all sports, and would as soon command
i a yachting contest as to direct a con
j flict with the navy of a first-class sea
. power. He declared at the outbreak of
: t'.ie late war he would make Spanish
: the court language of hell, and he is
. doubtless now arranging to start the
New York excursion steamers in the
same direction. Possibly when he re
i turna from the races he will receive a
i triumph, have a memorial arch in his
i honor and be mentioned as a candidate
' for the Presidency by several newspa
pers. Let us accept the situation as it
stands with unfretted minds and be
thankful the detail was not assigned to
Sampson or Schley or to Dewey him
self.

Concerning Sir Thomas Lipton, who
has come to this country to advertise
his wares and to win the America's cup
if he can, there are wide differences of
' opinion. He has been greeted in New
: York with something like an ovation
: and welcomed with the hearty words:
"We like you, Sir Thomas." In London
! he is not so much esteemed. One of the
aristocratic weeklies of that city, in
discussing the yacht race, said recently:
"The man can be of no interest what
ever except to his family and the
> shareholders of his grocery business."
The American appraisement of the
challenger is undoubtedly the more cor
rect of the two. Sir Thomas is decid
edly of interest to more people than
; London aristocrats think, and the judg
ment pronounced upon him by the
weekly which circulates in the clubs
was probably due to the neglect on his
: part to judiciously place his advertis
! ing. Certainly a man born in such
humble circumstances that it is a dis
; puted point whether he had his birth
! in Ireland or in Scotland, and who,
starting as a homeless waif, has worked
his way up to the proud position of a
challenger in an international yacht
! race, must be interesting to all persons
! except those who are blase and those
who like to talk about the weather. He
; has no blue blood in his veins, but he
i has what is betterâ the rich red blood
of a vigorous, sanguine manhood. He
knows his worth, moreover, as well as
any self-made man in our own country,
and though British clubmen sneer at
him the Iron will never enter his soul
as long as he has tin In his purse.
Professor Bacon of the State Univer
sity, in an address before the Unitarian
Club, set forth the imperialist Justifi
cation of the conquest of the Philippines
in this way:
"The theory of the white man's bur
den may briefly be stated as this: It is
the business and the interest and the
duty of the white man â that is, the man
of civilization â to rule, to care for, to
uplift, to enlighten and to bring if pos
sible into the light of modern civiliza
tion the other man wherever he ia
found; that it is at once their interest
and their duty to do this, with violence,
with tact, with kindness, as each may
be necessary; to do it whether the othor
man likes it or not; to do it at infinite
and immeasurable cost alike to the
white man and the other man, and, if
possible, to lift this lower, alien, colored
race to something like the plane of civ
ilization which the most advanced na
tions have reached."
That is the way conquest appears to
a closet philosopher. The way in which
it is applied in practice is told in a re
cent story by the Japan Mail. A crowd
of negro soldiers who were taking in
Manila and painting It as red as mili
tary regulations permit were accoÂ«ted
by a globe-trotter with the question:
"What are you boys doing here?"
"Why, boss," was the ready retort,
"we'se heah to take up de white man's
burden."

A Denver poet who has been casting
a prophetic eye into the dim and dis
tant future tells us in the rhyme of
something less than a dozfn stanzas in
the Denver Post what will happen a
century from now; and it is gratifying
to note that the prospect is promising â
bo promising, indeed, we need not worry
over imperialism, trusts, woman's^
rights or any other problem. He closes
by saying:
We yet will print Manila dates,
A century from now,
Blue-penciled by official skates,
A century from now. _ ari( i
The pampered pet who's In command
Will daily tell a waiting land,
"The situation's well in hand,
A century from now.
But you and I will never care,
A century from now;
We'll be old timers over there,
A century from now.
For all who quit this world of woe
Will dwell where peaceful waters flowâ
There'll be no hell at all, you know,
A century from now.
In the batch of papers brought In
from Japan by the latest steamer are
a good many Items of minor Interest
illustrating certain phases of life in j
that reawakened land. One of these is
the statement in the Japan Herald that
it has been offered a daily supply of tel
egrams but has refused them. The rea
son given for the refusal is this:
"We would have been quite willing at j
once to close with the offer did not our ;
experience and that of every other Jour
nal paying for telegrams prove that
their cost is never reimbursed by the
public, for whose information they are
procured and issued. If we with any
sort of certainty were able to look for- j
ward to being repaid to the extent of j
say one-half or upward the expendl- j
ture, we would be disposed to incur the i
cost of the balance."
Imagine a land where people who
patronize newspapers published in the |
P^nerlish language will not encourage j
an expenditure for telegrams! One
would have supposed the American and j
the Briton abroad would rather have
telegrams than beer, but It appears j
civilization grows languid in the Orient,
and even the most wide-awake dwellers
in the happy clime value telegraphic

however, and some of them have set
about the task of booming it as a para
dise for pleasure seekers â a land of an
infinite variety of delights. In the
Japan Herald a description of a new
tourist hotel just opened in one of the
romantic districts of the island says
of the villagre in which it is situated:
"Though it has not much population
the degree of livelihood of the inhabit
ants is comparatively excellent. Their
natural disposition is gentle and honest,
and their mutual friendship is so har
monious asÂ»that of a family. Draught
of pure air suspends no poisonous mix
ture, and always cleanses the defile
ment of our spirit. During the winter
days the coldness robs of all pleasures
from our hands, but at the summer
months they are set free. The first
pleasure in visiting the place Is the j
view of Fuji. Its regular configuration,
hanging down the sky like an opened
white fan, may be looked long at equal
shape fmm several regions surrounding
it. Every one who saw it ever has
nothing but applause. Wind proper in
quantity suits to our boat to slip by
sail, and moonlight shining on the sky,
shivers quartzy luster over ripples of
the lake. The cuckoo singing near to
our hotel plays on a harp! and the gulls
flying about to and fro seek their food
in the waves. All these panorama may
be gathered only in this place."
â¢ â¢ â¢
Such a galaxy of allurements so
brightly depicted is apt to breed in the
mind a fervent desire amounting almost
to a fever to hasten to Japan and en
joy the delights. Fortunately the anti
dote to the fever is furnished by a
writer for the Japan Mail, who declares
the land is by no means satisfactory to
civilized man. He admits there are
many charms. "All the irksome eti
quette of European customs," he
says, "may be dispensed with, all the
wearisome conventionalities Ignored,
and amid beautiful scenery in a salu
brious climate one may lead a comfort
able, untrammeled existence, ignorant
of the heart-burnings of cliques, re
lieved from the slavery of the tall hat
and the frock coat, and guaranteed
against the worry of servants."
He argues, however, there are many
deficiencies which more than counter
balance the joys, and sadly declares:
"Music, the drama, art, the march
of scientific discovery, the vigorous
struggle of the political paloestra, the
sight of the leaders of thought and the
sound of their voices, the great con
tests of physical skill in which the
Anglo-Sfttons delight, the splendid
museums that bring us into touch with
buried generations, the light of women's
loveliness, and, last but not least, the
chiming of the church bells â all these
things fade out of the life of a man who
makes Japan his place of abode."
â¢ â¢ *
In that wail for the lost Joys of
Europe by a satiated reveler in the
blisses of a land where newspaper read
ers are indifferent to telegrams and the
cuckoo has a harp, there is a sadness
so vivid it can almost be photographed.
Most assuredly it could be painted. It
is a pity that Millet is dead. The poetic
genius that painted the Angelus could
have made a dear and deeply moving
picture of a stray American or Briton
standing in the twilight, looking with
unsatisfied eyes upon a garden where
the Geishas are dancing, listening with
unpleased ears to the tinkling of the
little Japanese lutes, and longing for
the sound of âchurch bells. The pathos
of the thing is so natural it must appeal
at once to every appealable heart.
â¢ ...
It is only fair to both writer and to
Japan to add that considerable qualifi- !
cation is given to the statement that |
Japan has neither music, drama nor
lovely'' women. He admits they have â 
such things, but maintains they might
as well be without them so far as the
foreigner is concerned. "The music of
Japan," he says, "is beyond our com
prehension; It makes no sort of appeal
to us. The drama we recognize to be
of the highest class, if histrionic skill
alone. Is considered. To the European
or American, however, it Is merely a
curiosity."
As for the women, it is added: "We
do not want to be uncomplimentary to
the Japanese fair sex when we speak
of the absence of the light of woman's
loveliness. The words are chosen care- j
fully, it is one thing to see a few
pretty faces and graceful costumes al
most lost in the somber monotony of a
dingy crowd; it is another and a totally
different thing to see the varied beauty
that glows at a fete in Europe or Amer
ica, with all the dazzling adjuncts that
our luxurious civilization provides."
The defect of that statement is that
while it will not sufficiently atone to
the Japanese for the lack of adoration
of the loveliness of the ladies of Japan,
it casts a shade of suspicion upon tl.
feeling which prompted the yearnin
for church bells, and inclines to the be
lief that what the wanderer really
longed for were the festal belles.
â¢ â¢ *
There is one thing further to add upon
the issue. The statements of the Japan
Mall on any subject are not indorsed
by the Japan Herald. Indeed the Her
ald, in reviewing the course of the Mail
on general matters, says:
"If we are entitled to form a Judg
ment based on what seems his present
aberration of mind, destiny in dealing
with the editor of the Mail may event
ually determine his being an out-and
out crank; but for the present he ap
pears to be in that indeterminate and
ambiguous condition which lies be
tween the border land of sanity and
the reverse, though as yet there is no
sufficient reason for immuring him in
the walls of a lunatic asylum.
Of course the Mail man has his opin
ion of the Herald, and expresses it with
I equal vigor. The question whether
Jap*n is or is not a better pleasure
land than this remains, therefore, open
I not only to debate but to altercation
and to invective. The only conclusion to
be drawn with sureness from it all is
that while the English-speaking resi
! dents of Japan are willing to dispense
j with telegrams they delight heartily In
the live journalism that takes the skin
off the other fellow In every issue.

ANTIPATHY TO
FRANCE LESSENED
Germany Will Exhibit at
the Exposition.
Copj-rlghtiHj, 1599, by thÂ« Asso<-latÂ«d PrÂ»st.
BERLIN. Sept. 23.â Government
this week exerted strong pressure to
. induce German industry and commerce
,to abandon all movement apalnst the
Paris Exposition. Chief Commissioner
Richter sent a note to all the leaders
I of the movement, giving strong- reasons
why it would be unwise for Germany
I and injurious to her Interests not to
appear as strong as possible in Paris
in 1900. This and other facts have had
effect, and it may be Bald that the
anti-expansion movement In Germany
is entirely dead. A curious feature is
that the note dwelt on the fact that the
exposition is not a political but purely
economic enterprise, and that the mis
take of 1899, which seriously injured
i Germany's commercial prestige, must
not be repeated.
The Emperor is wroth at the Berlin
I municipality's refusal to co-operate
: with his plan for the embellishment of
the vicinity of the royal castle by the
removal of all the neighboring old
i ramshackle buildings. The municipal
ity, of which Herr Singer and other so
cialists are prominent members, Justi
! flea the refusal by the plea that the
, millions required to carry out the plan
, cannot be spared, as they are needed
to meet the increasing demands of the
municipal treasury for the assistance
of the poor and for the communal
schools. His Majesty is convinced that
| the real reason for the refusal is the
domination of the radical and revolu
i tionary elements.
As a sign of his displeasure the Em
peror has instructed the Minister of
i the Interior to withhold the confirma
; tion of the new Chief Mayor, Herr
Kirschner, until there is a visible sign
of the improved political attitude of
Berlin, or force the election of a man
: wholly to the Emperor's tastes for the
; office.
Germany will soon have new postage
stamps of one, two, four and five
j marks. They are to be closely mod
eled after the size and style of the
United States Columbian stamps of
: 1893. â 
The floods have subsided throughout
Germany. The damage done is enor
i mous, amounting to millions of marks.
The magnificent Prince Regent bridge
at Munich has been completely demol
ished. It will be reconstructed wholly
at the expense of the Prince Regent,
at a cost of about a million marks.
I Lilli Lehman, the singer, was kept a
prisoner by the flood throughout the
week in her villa at Schaerfling.
The press this week devoted unusual
space to American politics. Regarding
the anti-trust convention at â¢ Chicago
the opinion has been expressed that
neither party dares to seriously fight
the trusts. Thomas B. Reed's reported
! candidacy for President is hailed with
approval, and President McKinley's
Plttsburg speech is bitterly condemned
: as "undignified and insincere."
The semi-official Post in an inspired
j article quoting the New York Tribune's
article on German-American relations
| says:
"This and other articles elsewhere
show these relations have Indeed im
proved." The paper expresses the hope
that "this good work will go on."
On request of the Austrian butchers
the directors of the German National
Butchers' Association will call a meet

ANVIL CITY, Alaska, Sept. B.â Anvil
City is but a few months old, yet It has
the distinction of being the first city In
this and the Yukon River section of the
Alaskan Territory *b.ere a trial by Jury
has ever been held.
Charles S. Johnson, United States Dis
trict Judge; Albert D. Elliot, clerk of the
United States District Court and ex
offlclo secretary for Alaska, and Alfred
J. Daly, Assistant United States District
Attorney, have been here for a week in
an endeavor to untangle the complica
tions that have arisen from too many
men wanting some other man's gold
mine. In the short time that the court
could spare to this place It attended to
no less than twenty-one suits and there
wefe more to be heard from. Of the
number heard there were four libel suits.
In the case of Hyde et al. vs. Thlbault,
tho parties to the suit agreed to have
a Jury trial. A jury was empaneled from
the bystanders and upon hearing the evi
dence" brought In a verdict for the plain
tiff. This decision entitles the plaintiff to
the possession of claim 7 on Dexter
Creek. A motion for a new trial was
denied.
In the case of Engelstadt vs. Dufrane,
a suit brought through breach of con
tract, a receiver was appointed in the
person of A. M. Pape of the Alaska Com
mercial Company, who will have charge
of the claim (No. 10 on Dexter Creek)
until the case is decided. Mr. Pape gave
Jld.uOO bonds.
Outside of the libel suits, the cases
nearly all were applications for receiv
ers or restraining orders as to mining
claims, In which the title or ownership
Is In dispute between two or more par
tieÃ The question in dispute In most
cases is as to who is real locator or in
volving the question as to location by
power of attorney.or parties locating be
ing foreigners. There was no decision
made In the power of attorney cases.
This question will come up before the
neat court, which will bo held next JunÂ«
Judge" Johnson on this trip held the
first court ever held on the Yukon River.
The first Grand Jury ever empaneled in
this section of the Territory was at Cir
cle City. It brought In four true bills
and refused to indict in four cases. The
cases will be tried next summer by this
court. Judge Johnson is the only Judge
that Alaska has, and he certainly has
his hands full. He and his party came
in over the lake and river route to Daw
son about the middle of July, and stop
ping at the following places he appointed
Court Commissioners and Deputy Lnlted
States Marshals: Eagle City, Circle City,
Rampart City, Weare, Anvik, Peavy and
Anvil City. *At this Place Alonzo Raw
eon was appointed Court Commissioner
and J. H. Lee Marshal. Notaries were
also appointed at Eagle, Circle, Rampart,
St Michael and Anvil City. Dewey's for
mer dispatch boat MoCullough is now at
St. Michael, waiting to take the party
back to Sitka.
Governor John G. Brady will Join them
at St Michael and be a member of the
party from there. He is making a trip
over" the Territory for the purpose of
looking after the needs of the people,
which will be embodied in his annual re
port to the Department of the Interior.
It will be of interest to the many friends
of Dr J R. Gregory at Healdsburg, Cal..

Important Matters to Come Up at the

LOS ANGELES, Sept. Â».â When the
State Board of Health meets in Los An
geles on September 23 plans will be dis
cussed to prevent the introduction of
smallpox and other contagious discuses
into Southern California through infection
by unrestricted travel from Arizona,
Texas or Mexico. Dr. Randolph \V. Hill,

The medical fraternity is almost a unit
that nomethins must be done to brinÂ«
about the end desired. Health Offlcer 1*
M Powers has requested the authorities
to' devise plans to police the Arizona and
Mexican borders.
It is more than probable that inspectors
will be placed at all points of ingress on
the State border to prevent the bringing
of contagion into the State. Dr. Crow
lev's proposal to quarantine against con
sumption also will be further discussed.
It is expected that some decided action
will be taken in this matter, as physicians
are taking more than a passing Interest
ln Dr ie Hm said to-day that he will make
reDo'rt to his colleagues, suggesting a

Board at once appoint a mliJc and dairy
inspector for Southern California.

TRADES UNION MAN
WHO DEFENDS TRUSTS
President Schaffer of the Iron and
Steel Workers Before the In
dustrial Commission.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 23.â Theodore
Schaffer of I'ittsburg, president of the
Amalgamated Association of Iron and
Steel Workers, was a witness before the
Industrial Commission to-day. He said
that about 70 per cent of the iron, steel
and tin workers were organized. After
IM'2 the ironworkers suffered 30 per cent
reduction of wages, the steel workers
10 per cent and the tinworkers 25 per cent,
but since the recent prosperity began the
wages have been almost leveled up by
advances. The trade was now more pros
perous than it ever had been, but the
wages were not quite as high as in 1592.
The workers in iron, steel and tin were
not getting the advantage under the slid-
Ing Bcale of the recent increase in prices.
This was due to the fact that mills were
lilling contracts made some months, and,
in some ca.srs, a year ago.
Asked about trusts. Mr. Schaffer said
he had much respect for thorn. He would
not call them "trusts." Their effect thus
far had been beneficial to the iron, steel
and tin workprs. As a general rule, he
said, he believed the members of his or
ganization would prefer to deal with com
binations and largo C3rporations than with
smaller and Independent mills. He be
lieved If the big combinations could bo
regulated by Congressional enactment
strikes could be avoided. In his experi
ence he had always had fair treatment in
negotiating with these combinations. Ho
did not believe they prevented competi
tion.
B. B. Norris of Sodus N. V., master of
the State Grange of New York, was a
witness. He thought the condition of the
farm laborer, physical! v and morally, waa
much better than in the olden days. He
had more privileges, he was better edu
cated and informed and obtained wages
high enough to enable htm to lay aside
something if he was sober and indus
trious.

ASTORIANS WANT
BETTER RATES
The Vanderbilt System
Brings Hope.
QUESTION OF THE TERMINAL
WOULD BE A VAST SAVING TO
AGBICTTLTUItISTS.
â¦
Special IMrpateh to The Call.
ASTORIA. Sept. 23.â Whether or not the
Vanderbilt ocean-to-ocean system is to
terminate at Astoria is a question that
is being anxiously discussed In North
west railroad circles. The fact that the
Astoria and Columbia River Railroad Is
owned or controlled by men who are in
terested in the Vanderbilt system gives
rise to the belief that this city will be
made the Western terminal of the new
transcontinental, and that In the near
future all the products of the Columbian
basin will be shipped from this port.
The Astoria and Columbia River Rail
road runs to Portland, where it connects
with the transcontinental. Thus far the
latter roads have refused to grant com
mon point rates to Astoria except on lum
ber and wheat is still shipped from Port
land. The common point question has
been agitated for several months past and
a plan 1Â» now on foot to make it a po
litical Issue In the naxt State election.
Advocates of the Astoria proposition
contend that the granting of common
point rates to this port means a saving j
of over three millions of dollars annually
to the farmers of the inland empire. . At
the present time the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company, Great Northern and
Northern Paciac are under agreement to
maintain certain rates. The Oregon road I
has a great advantage over the lines ter- j
mlnating on Puget Sound in a fine down
grade, and it has been estimated that
where the cost to the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company of hauling a ton of
wheat from points in the Columbian basin
to Portland is but 25 cents the coÃt to
the Northern Pacific and Great Northern j
is $1 20.
Owing to Portland's limited harbor fa
cilities the cosl of exporting wheat from
that place is very great, and it is mathe
matically demonstrated that the granting i
of common point rates on grain to Astoria ;
would effect a saving to the farmers of j
$2 50 a ton, the greater tonnage possiole :
at this port being one of the principal
reasons for this great difference. The ;
railroads and wheat pool stand in on the !
deal, however, and over $3,000,000 annually j
is mulcted from the wheat growers. The |
farmers are now taking up the agitation j
and it is understood that an effort will i
be made to have the next State Legis
lature bring down to a reasonable figure
the exorbitant rate now charged for haul
ing wheat to Portland.
Of course, if the Vanderbilts have de
cided on Astoria as the terminal for their :
line, no other railroad combination could
prevent the exporting of wheat from As- j
toria. This is why officials of the rail- i
road combine are worrying, and why the I
farmers of the inland empire and the peo- j
pie of Astoria are on the anxious seat.
Recently there was formed in New Jer- i
sey the Astoria Company, with a capital- ]
izatlon of $30,000,000. This company Is at
present secretly buying up immense tim
ber tracts near this city and gathering
in all the "good things." The incorpor
ators are J. Pierpont Morgan, John Claf
lin. Collls P. Huntlngton and Andrew B. I
Hammond, the latter president and pro- ]
moter of the Astoria and Columbia River
Railroad Company. The fact that Ham
mond is president of the salmon can
ners' combine is evidence that the As
toria company means to corral the fish
ing industry as well as the timber of the
country near here, and that it is behind
the movement to amalgamate all the sal
mon fisheries of the Pacific Coast into
one gigantic trust, mention of which was
made in The Call some time ago.
That no effort will be made to open up
the Astoria proposition until all the "good
things" have been scooped in is regarded
as a certainty, though it is possible the
people may yet force action by popular
agitation. Excepting San Francisco. As
toria is the cheapest port on the Pacific
Coast, and the unnatural condition of
wheat being exported from Portland can
not long exist.
There is perhaps more money in the
"good tilings" in this section than there
is in railroading, so, even though the Van
derbilts mean to rume here, it would pay
those interested to hold off for a year.
This is believed to be the plan. The As
toria road is losing from $3000 to $7000
monthly, yet tho officials absolutely de
cline to assist the people in getting com
mon point rates, which would mean an
immense Increase in trafllf, but on the
contrary down every effort so directed.
It Is very evident that the apparently
chaotic railroad situation is clear to As
toria railroad owners, and that the local
line is well provided for In the arrange
ments which are supposed to have been
made.
Meantime the farmefs are losing mil
lions of dollars annually, and the men
who own vast tracts near the city are
slowly being forced to the wall, their
property to fall Into the hands of the
Astoria' company.

A COMMON TROUBLE.
Thousands Suffer From It
Without Knowing Its Real
Character.
No trouble Is more common or moral
misunderstood than nervous dyspepsia.l
People having it think that their nervesi
are to blame, are surprised that they arel
not cured by nerve medicines and springl
remedies; the real seat of mischief is lostl
sight of; the stomach is the organ to be j
looked after.
Nervous dyspeptics often do not have
any pain whatever in the stomach, nor
perhaps any of the usual symptoms of
stomach weakness. Nervous dyspepsia
shows Itself not in the stomach bo much
as in nearly every other organ; in some
cases the heart palpitates and Is Irreg-
ular; In others the kidneys are affected;
in others the bowels are troubled, with
logs of Hesh and appetite, with the accu-
mulation of gas. sour risings and heart-
burn.
Mr. A. W. Sharper of No. 61 Prospect
street, Indianapolis, Ind., writes as fol-
lows: "A motive of pure gratitude
prompts me to write these few lines re- :
g-arding the new and valuable medicine, j
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I have been ;
a sufferer from nervous dyspepsia for the j
last four years; have used various patent
medicines and other remedies without any
favorable result. They sometimes gave:
temporary relief until the effects of the
medicine wore off. I attributed this to i
my sedentary habits, being a. bookkeeper j
with little physical exercise, but I am j
glad to state that the tablets have over-
come all these obstacle, for I have j
gained in flesh, sleep better and am better
in every way. The above is written not i
for notoriety, but Is based on actual facts.
Respectfully yours,
"A. W. SHARPER,
"fil Prospect St., Indianapolis, Ind.' 1
It is safe to say that Stuart's Dyspepsli i
Tablets will cure any stomach weakness
or disease except cancer of the stomach, j
They cure sour stomach, gas, loss of flesh

heartburn, constipation and headaches.

Eieruam ana new vorK. me negotiations
for the property were instituted by Speyei
& Co. last April. About a month ago the
buyers and sellers agreed on the price
and within the past week large sums of
money on account of the transaction
have been transferred through the Lon
don, Paris and American Bank and the
bank of Crocker, "\Yoolworth & Co.
Men In this city and in New York who
are prominent in financial circles have
not the slightest doubt that the Speyers
In the negotiations acted at the instance
of C. P. Huntlngton. No doubt C P.
Huntington resolved when his nephew
was dispiaeed to put the affairs of the
company in such shape that absolute con
trol by the Hunting-tons could not be suc
cessfully disputed in the future.
George Crocker's career as a railroad
man is about to close with his consent.
He has obtained for his Interest In the
road the value which he placed on his
stock, and will retire from his position in
the yellow building without disappoint
ment or regret. New York possesses some
attractions for George Crocker and his
family which San Francisco does not of
fer, hence he has elected to reside in the
former city. Will Crocker may be called
East to assist in the adjustment of busi
ness affairs growing out of tne impor
tant transfer of railroad properties, but
he entertains no thought of making New
York his home.
The great fortunes acquired by the orig
inal promotors of the Central Pacific are
being scattered far. and wide. Stanford's
millions have gone into the realm of
higher education, much to the disgust of
C. P. Huntington. The millions which
â went to Judge E. B. Crocker's children
have contributed something to the Joys
of the world. Mark Hopkins, the most
prudent and saving of the five, left an
Immense fortune. The modest inventory
In the Probate Court of San Francisco
placed the wealth which his widow in
herited at nineteen millions of dollars.
Borne of the money has been devoted to
the promotion of architecture and dec
orative art.
Colonel Colton did not get as much
money out of the company as any one
of the other originals obtained, but he
got some wonderfully interesting letters
rom C. P. Huntington.
The genial vice president, J. C. Stubbs,
Is not convinced by The Call that â¢"Glad
Hand Mac," the passenger traiiic man
ager, is to relieve the law department of
political responsibilities. There is an old
adage In railroading that a good freight
man knows nothing but freight, and
Btubbs is surely a vital verification of the
truth of the adage. Should the people of
California again rise up in their wrath
and demand the removal from office of
the Railroad Commissioners or the sub
mission of a constitutional amendment
to abolish the commission, what sense
would there be In sending Herrin to Sac
ramento to save the Commissioners? Any
one outside of a freight office ought to
know the difference between a glad hand
and a web foot.
"Glad Hand Mac" would be Just the
man for such an emergency. He would
go to Sacramento in broad daylight and
walk right in to the Senate Chamber
and give the glad hand alike to Demo
cratic and Republican Senators. "Glad

CALIFORNIA VETERANS
ARE TURNED DOWN
WHAT BECAME OF THE NAMES
SENT THE GOVEBNOB,
Talk About the First Regiment â
Fag-e-Street Armory Is Ready
for Its Reception.
The First Regiment of the California
Volunteers, formerly the First Infantry
Regiment of the National Guard, has been
mustered out of the service of the United
States and the officers and men have re
turned to civil life. There were a number
of the officers of the regiment who had
I expressed a desire to return to the volun-
I teer service, provided they would be com- [
. missioned. And it was expected that sev
: eral of these would receive commissions
â  from the chief executive of the State.
Colonel Duboce sent a number of names :
to the Governor for commissions in the
j new regiments of volunteers, but not one
| of these was honored. The wonder is what
I became of them. The members of the
regiment as a whole feel somewhat mor
tiiied that the first regiment that was or
) dered into foreign service should have
been turned down.
. The indications are that â¢within two
months the First Regiment of the Na
; tional Guard will be reorganized and that
| nearly all the officers who entered the ,
! volunteer service will report for duty un
der the provisions of the act of the .Legis
! lature granting them the opportunity of
re-entering the service of the State at any !
time within 150 days after being mustered
out of the volunteer service. Many of
these officers while in the foreign service
have outlived their commissions and there
i will have to be a number of elections in
i companies, but hew many of the officers
whose commissions have run out will
stand for re-election is unknown, as it is
stated that some of them will not con- !
| tinue in the guard; that they will simply I
i report for duty and then resign. The late
, coioncl of the Fust Volunteers will re
enter as lieutenant colonel, which posi
tion he held at the time he enlisted in the
volunteers, as Brigadier General James F.
Smith is still the colonel. Unless he should j
resign upon his return he would, if he re
entered the guard, resume his position as
colonel of the regiment.
Whenever the regiment does return to
duty it will hnd the armory at Page and
Gough streets in as good condition as it
was when it marched away from there .
fifteen months ago. The property of the
State and the company property con- â 
tamed therein has under special orders j
been in charge of Major Jansen, brigade
inspector of the Second Brigade, and un
. der his directions Charles M. Sheldon, i
the old-time armorer of the First, has
been the care-taker, occupying the big j
building all by his lonely day and night, i
The company rooms are in as good condi
tion as they were when occupied, the only
difference being that the lockers have
been emptied of full-dress uniforms and j
other property, all of which has been '
carefully stored away in the large store
room on the upper floor. In the company
I rooms the lockers of those soldiers who i
1 laid down their lives In the service of ;
their country are draped in mourning. As
i soon as the regiment is ready to return to
i the armory everything will be replaced
Just as It was before the war. In the
Grillroom there are about two hundred
anil fifty rit!M In the racks, of which
about one hundred and fifty are service- j
, able in case of emergency, several cases I
I containing rifles that are unfit for service, |
and any number of boxes of curios from .
the Philippines that were brought from '
there by the officers of the First. There
is also a memento of the war which will :
probably remain in the armory. It is an '
old-fashioned brass swivel gun mounted j
on a truck, which from its construction
must be one of the guns placed on the '
islands by the Spaniards two hundred ;
yenrs or more ago.
The veterans of the National Guard at
their last held meeting admitted to mem- j
bership ex-Sergeant V. J. Fell. Second j
Artillery; ex-Corporal W. "W. Thompson,
of Company G, First Infantry, and lieu
tenant Colonel F. A. Vail of the brigade I
staff. Brigadier General C. F. A. Last,
First Brigade; M. H. Gaffr.ey. and S. Ro
r.enthal re-entered the association.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 23. 1891.
Special Orders No. 204:
A board of officers consisting of Lieutenant
Colonel Wallace F. Randolph, Third Artillery;
Major Robert J. Gibson, surgeon, and Major
Robert H. Noble, assistant adjutant general
United States Volunteers, will at once assem
ble on board the transport Sherman to ex
amine Into, report upon and ascertain the
cannes leading to the explosion on board of that
phlp of "a box of primers, the property of the
Thirtieth Infantry, United States Volunteers.
By command of Major General Phafter:
J. B. BABCOCK,
Assistant Adjutant General.
In accordance with the above order the
board met early yesterday aboard the
Sherman and held a searching Investiga
tion. From what can be gathered on the
outside the blunder that has resulted In
the death of one man and the- wounding
of three others was made at the Rock
Island arsenal. At Fort Sheridan It was
known a mistake had been made, but by
some unaccountable means It was not
rectified and the accident In the hold of
the transport followed.
The ordnance supplies for the Thirtieth
Regiment were sent from Rock Island
arsenal to Fort Sheridan. At the inves
tigation yesterday the quartermaster ser
geant of the Thirtieth testified that he
received the ordnance supplies sent for
the use of the regiment from Rock Island.
Among the boxes of cartridges was one
containing 100,000 primers. This box was
put aside and whether It got mixed up I
I again with cartridge boxes and came on j
to San Francisco or not he could not
tell. In the light of after events It seems |
reasonably certain that the box of prim- I
ers came on as a box of cartridges and
it was that package that caused the dis
aster in the hold of the Sherman.
There were over twenty longshoremen
handling the ordnance supplies when the
accident happened. The boxes were all
In the hold and were being placed in the
magazine. The m<n were in a line from
where the boxes were piled to the maga
zine door and each box was passed from
man to man until it reached the maga
zine, where it was stored. All of the
uninjured longshoremen testified yester
day that the greatest of care was used !
in handling the stuff. Captain Barneson
and other officers of the transport ser
vice testilied to the same effect and the
board is satisfied that there was no care
lessness at this end of the affair. It will
be some weeks before Fort Sheridan and !
the Rock Island arsenal caji be heard j
from and in the meantime the inquiry will !
remain open.
John Burke died of his injuries at the !
Harbor Hospital yesterday morning and i
his body was taken to the Morgue. He
was conscious up to the last and suf
fered terribly. A few minutes before
death he asked l>r. Morrison to end his j
sufferings. Everything possible was done j
to alleviate his pain and save his life, I
but it was not to be. Death was due !
to loss of blood and shock. Ho was 35
years of age and a native of Brooklyn,
N. Y. An inquest will be held on Mon
day.
Frank Klein is In a precarious condi
tion. He was removed to Lane Hospital.
Charles Anderson was discharged from
the Receiving Hospital early yesterday j
morning. He will be all right again in a i
few days.
John Miller, who lives at 1507 I-eaven- j
worth street, is another 'longshoreman
who was injured. He called at the Har
bor Hospitui yesterday morning and Dr. i
Morrison removed one of the primers j
MME. MODJESKA AS
MARIE ANTOINETTE
THE above half-tone pictures the Polish actress as she will appear on
Monday night in rilnton Stuart's latest historical drama. Recollections
of Modji-ska as Mary Stuart warrant the conclusion that the regal
Marie Antoinette, the 111-fated Queen who controlled the affairs of state
while Louis led a placid life of rood fare and meditation, will be perfectly
portrayed. What glimpse will be got of the gay and frivolous days of
"I,ittle Trianon," where the Joyou3 and impulsive -woman led a life of ex
travagant unconventionality, is still in conjecture. Tha play has had the
benefit of a fortnight's suburban trial and consequent pruning and comes
to San Francisco in three-hour shape. Modjeska, it is whiÃpered, has ma
terially assisted her manager, John C. Fisher, in designing the scenery for
the production, for she is an artist of no mean ability. John E. Keller who
appeared here some years since with Marie Burroughs, is the star's leading
man.

The towing of rafts from Puget Sound

Marine Engineers' Association has taken
the matter up and is preparing a petition
which will be presented to CongTess by
Congressman Julius Kahn. Besides the
Marine Engineers it will be signed by

ALMOND TRUST NOT FORMED
Local Commission merchants Deny
the Chicago Story.
A recent dispatch from Chicago stated
that a combination had been formed to
I run up the price of almonds to a high
I figure and that San Francisco firms are
i concerned in the scheme. The local com
! mission merchants of this city denounce
the rumor as false and say that a com
bination has not been nor will be made.
They claim that the almond crop of Cali
fornia fell below expectation this year
and that necessarily the prices have been
raised a little. Contributory to this is the
failure of the foreign crop. California
I was expected to furnish about 300 carloads
! of the nuts, but only lfiO were raised. The

ARE ONCE MORE
UP AGAINST IT
Southern Pacific and
Gold Bricks.
JOKERS IN THE CONTRACTS
ONE WAY TO SQUEEZE MONEY
OUT OF THE PEOPLE.
The Congestion of Transportation
Facilities Used by the Rail
road as a Means Toward
an Unfair End.
The Southern Pacific Company has
passed cut another gold brick, and! as
usual, it Is the merchants and shippers
of California who have purchased the spu
rious article. This time it is tho traffic i
department that is operating in the bunko ;
line, and the returns i^romise to add a !
pretty penny to the coffers of the road.
a time ago the Southern Pacific j
xnado a bid for the freight that was being |
shipped by water both to Eastern points
and to coastwise ports. It offered the big
Bhippers of the State a reduction in
freight rates of about one-fifth of the pre- |
vious charges, which gave them a chajice |
to send their goods to market by rail
with some hope of a reasonable profit j
from their sales.
As long as traffic was light this agree- j
Xnent was faithfully observed by the rail- \
road and all went well. Both the ship
pen and the carriers were making money ;
and no one had any complaint to make.
But this era of fair dealing was not to j
continue. It was merely a makeshift to |
control business during lax times and to i
provide for a coup which would more
than reimburse the company for any con
cessions it had made. The joker that the
Southern Pacific had up its sleeve was i
only being held until the proper moment i
came to produce it. The aforesaid joker \
â¢was a little clause inserted at the bottom j
of the contracts giving the railroad people |
the right to abrogate the agreement on
ten days' notice.
Now that nearly all the available yes- ';
eels are tied up by the tremendous amount !
of Government business that has fol
lowed in the wake of war the Southern I
Pacific has concluded that the time has
come to play Its trump card, and con
sequently, having obtained from the In
terstate Commerce Commission the right I
to increase its rates on the goods affected
by the previous reduction, it has notified
the big shippers of the State that on Oc
tober 10 the freight rates previously re
duced will be restored to their original
figures.
This change has been timed to catch
the wine men, the grain and lumber ship- I
pers, and In fact all the large industries
of the State when it is Imperative for
them to pay the advance in order to get
their goods to market and fulfill the con
tracts they have made with their buyers.
Not only will this trick affect the pro- j
ducers of the State but there is hardly
a large commercial house in the city do- i
ing business in lines such as coal an. 1 ! !
hardware that will not be a big loser by j
the blow it has received at the hands of i
the railroad. There are a number of mer
chants who will feel the difference to the
tune of thousands of dollars, and to others
the matter is of so great moment as to be
almost of vital importance.
As all the vessels are tied up, there is
no redress for them. They have to ship
their poods and the only way for them to >
do It Is to pay their tribute and watch '
their past profits flow into the vaults of j
tho Southern Pacific Company.

OGDEN TELLS OF
NEW OIL FIELDS
PROMISING WELL
Crop of Millionaires
Is Predicted.
"California will soon have a new crop
of millionaires. " This is the Btatement
made yesterday by M. M. Ogden, the field
expert of the California Oil Exchange,
who has just returned from a tour of ex
amination through the new oil districts
of California. The millionaires will, In his
opinion, be made such by wealth taken
out of the soil in the shape of oil. "That
is my firm opinion," reiterated Mr. Ogden
when he was (iuestioned. "There is no
doubt about it."
From this pleasing generalization Mr.
Ogden descended to particulars and told
something about the districts visited by
him, describing the. work under way. Mr.
Ogden first visited the Coalinga district
and made a general examination. Next
he visited the Oil City district, ten miles
from Coalinga. He then took in the
Kreynhagen district, which is southwest
of Coalinga and distant about twenty
miles. The A venal district, ten miles far
ther south, and the McKittriclc district, in
Kern County, also received attention. All
this was preliminary to making a report
to the Oil Exchange, which report will be
accompanied by maps showing the trend
of the oil-bearing sands, the location of
wells and other essential information.
"Oil City district," said Mr. Ogden, "is
producing 4500 barrels of oil per day. This
is all taken from one section of land and
the most of it conies from a small part of
that section. There are twenty wells
there. Oil City is ten miles from the rail
road. A pipe line connects Oil City with
Coalinga. Chanslor & Caniield are operat
ing there. â  The wells range-in depth from
Tixj to 1500 feet. The oil sand at Oil City
runs through the pay belt northeast and
southwest and pitches about thirty feet
to every 100 feet. The wells at the north
end are shallow. Farther south they
grow deeper. The New York Oil Com
pany has a well 1600 feet deep. They will
probably strike oil at a depth of 20vu feet.
"The district has been kept back by a
lack of water for development, but
Chansior & Canfleld have tunneled to
the north and water has been piped in.
Now the drills are starting. .Little in
formation has been had from this dis
trict except that referring to section 2u,
because the test wells have been sunk less
â¢ than 800 feet. Captain McClurg has sunk
a well live miles from Oil City that is
flowing 500 barrels per day.
"The oil sands run southwest across the
land of the Royal Oil Company, where a
model rig has been erected. In section 22
the Caribou Oil Company has a rig work
ing with excellent prospects. The Invest
ment, California, Aetna and Santa Ciara
Companies will also drill. The Blue
Goose is working in section 20 and the
Selma has a deep hole. The Phoenix is
also drilling and the Mutual has pro
spects.
"There has been some delay because
casings for the wells have been shipped
in slowly. Casings are now coming in
from the East and as a consequence the
work should be more than doubled in two
months. The oil sand crops out again at
a point of hills just east of the Alcalde
Coal Company. Then it trends south and
west and through the high range. The
owners of test wells are lucky who hap
pen to get on this belt. The Commer
cial Oil Company has an 1100-foot well
down. The Badger State has a deep hole
in the same township. There is a big oil
seepage in that township, which is town
ship 21, range 14 east.
"In the Kreynhagen tract the oil sand
is found running in from the northwest,
through the high ranges. The oil is more
volatile than that found at Oil City and
contains a high percentage of lubricants.
There is a promising group of oil prop
erties at this point. These Include the
Northtield, St. Lawrence, Baby King,
Bradford, Consolidated, Kings County,
Kreynhagen, Black Mountain and Stanley
oil companies' holdings. Kreynhagen has
one well down to oil and has not yet
reached the main body of sand. The
dally production from this well is about
twenty barrels of line oil. Oil has been
struck by the Baby King and St. Law
rence. At Tar Canyon there is an area
of oil seepage covering one and a half acres
where the layers lap just like lava flows.
Up the canyon is an oil spring. The
Avenal Company is developing there and
will undoubtedly make a line strike.
"The McKittrick district is seventy
miles from Bakersfield, in Kern County.
The wells are shallower. The oil is
heavier than that found farther north.
It Is much like the Los Angeles oil.
Milton McWhorter is one of the largest
developers in that section and he is find
ing a lot of oil. The Shamrock Company
has struck oil at 400 feet. I am satisfied
that no part of the United States will
produce as much oil as California as soon
as the valley has been developed. The
oil belt extends throughout the State,
from tiie Oregon line to San Diego."
COMPANY F BANQUETS
RETURNED VOLUNTEERS
Famous National Guard Organization
Honors the Men Who Bore
Its Name to the Front.
The members of Company F of the First
California Volunteers were the guests of
honor at a banquet given by the members
of Company F of the National Guard in
their armory on Ellis street, near Polk,
last evening. Fully 100 of the volunteers
and National Guard men Eat down to an
excellent repast set for them in the main

A delightful evening was spent by the
members of the guard and their guests.
The past was recalled by the veterans,
who told stories of camp life, and the
volunteers responded in kind with inci
dents of their stay In the Philippines.
Colonel Duboce received an ovation on
entering the banquet rail. In an eloquent
speech he told of the love he had for Com
pany-F, it being the company he entered
at the beginning of his long service in the
National Guard. He dweit on the splendid
work achieved by his command in the
Philippines and the pleasure it gave him
to know that they did their duty. On con
cluding his remarks he was greeted with
the old cry of the company: "Kali, Rah,
Rah! Eddy. Eddy! Zip, Boom! Ah!
Titer." . M
The most pathetic and fervent speech
of the evening was delivered by the old
armorer, "Peggy" Brown, hero of the
Mexican and Civil wars, who lost a leg
in the service of his country, and who has
served in- his present position since the
organization of the company in 1871. When
his name was called a hearty cheer greet

OPIUM FAMINE
AT SAN QUENTIN
Results of Aguirre's
Detective Work.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTJN PRISON, Sept. 23.â Tn
the few months of his incumbency
Warden Aguirre has not only managed
to clear the prison entirely of opium, so
that a famine in the drug now exists
among the convicts, but he has destroyed
the "ring" whose operations made tne,
traffic in the drug a possibility. This de
tective work of Aguirre has brought
about a condition of affairs hitherto un
heard of in the history of the penitenti
ary, fifteen men now being under the
care of Prison Physician Casey on ac
count of the suffering incident to a fail
ure to secure the "hasheesh" they were
accustomed to use daily.
The prisoners themselves admit that for
nearly two months there has not been an
ounce of opium smuggled through the
gates. As a result, convicts that formerly
presented the appearance of human
shadows and were covered with ulcers
from using opium have improved to an
extent that their own relatives have
hardly been able to recognize them. A
remarkaule case in point Is that of
Patrick Ryan, who is serving a life
sentence from San Francisco for robbery,
with a prior conviction. Ryan was sum
moned into the office of the Warden to
day and permitted to tell his own story.
â¢â¢1 have been using opium for fifteen
years," he said, "and have spent fourteen
years of that period here. 1 got all the
â¢dope' I wanted until about two months
a"o when it became impossible to get the
smallest quantity. 1 began to have
crumps and could hold nothing on my
stomach. 1 had to let myself ue locked
Up and treated by Dr. Casey. For four
days 1 suffered and then the pain was
all over. I weighed luo pounds when 1
Quit and had twenty-two ulcers on my
body Now I weigh ID9 pounds and all the
ulcers are gone but one on my arm. which
is fast disappearing. My brother came
over to see me three weeks ago and
didn't know me until I spoke to him."
In the cell with Ryan is Harvey Moul
ton, a colored convict, serving two jward
for burglary. Moulton is a cocaine Send,
and when he readied here fifty days ak"
was shut up where he could not i>< ssibly
get any cocaine. At that time he weighed
only 129 pounds, though six ft -t two
inches in height. The convict is now f;;>t
approaching the 200-pound murk and baa
lost all desire for coouine. Among the llf
tÂ«en men confined for using opium is also
the notorious "Frisco Slim," who was
concerned in a conspiracy to break prison.
Warden Aguirre says all that is neces
sary to break the men of the habit is to
keep them away from opium, feed them
well and give a little medical treatment
for the first three or four days only. The
Prison Directors are pleased with the
Warden's success in breaking 1 up the
death-dealing trrttllc and have all secured
souvenirs of his work. Amonjr them are
cleverly constructed hypodermic syringes
of glass, knives for opening the skin.
small packages of the drug- anil pipes
made out of small bottles. The Warden
has a large collection of the3e instru

UNION PACIFIC
TO GAIN CONTROL
Will Acquire Stock of
the O. R. and N.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Sept. 23 -At Salt Lake City,
October 9, a meeting of the Union Pacific
stockholders will be held which promises
to mark a new epoch in the history of
that great property. The preferred capi
tal stock and common capital stock will
be increased sufficiently to permit thÂ«
acquisition of the outstanding preferred
and common stcck of the Oregon Railway
and Navigation Company and the collat
eral trust income B4 per cent bonds of the
Oregon Short Line Company. Through
the acquisition of the Oregon Short
Line bonds, the Union Pacific
will strengthen its proprietary in
terest in the Short Line Company and ef
fect an advantageous change in the
character of the securities. With the se
curing of the preferred stock of the Ore
gon Railway and Navigation Company
and of the common stock of that com
pany, exclusive of that already acquired
and' held by the Short Line Company,
the Union Pacific will confirm and com
plete its control of the Navigation prop
erty, which was partially secured
through the conversion of the Oregon
Short Line stock, accomplished in the
early part of the present year, and will
obtain ownership, practically absolute, of
the through line to the Pacific Coast from
Omaha. _ ._
The stockholders of the Union Pacific
express themselves almost unanimously
in favor of this plan and its completion
is a certainty. Such an absorption as
proposed will make of the Union Pacific
and its allied branches one of the great
est, most powerful and influential railway
systems in the world.
It Ie said in railway circles here that
tlw next step will be the acquisition of
a line into Seattle, either by purchase or
by an extension of the Navigation line,
and that solid trains between Omaha and
Seattle will be running within a com
paratively short time. An official who is
in a position to know, but who will not
permit hi? name to be given, said to-day
it will be the rolicy of the new system
to route business to the Puget Sound
ports where the steamships from Asiatic
points touch regularly and this, of course
means a diversion of traffic from the old
channels. ______^____.

atPaciiic-street wharf at > o'clock yester
day morning, but it was nearly two hours
later when the signal for the long march
to the Presidio was given. In the mean
time Governor Smith of Montana ex
changed cordial greetings with officers
and men who have so creditably main
tained the honor of their State on the bat
tlefields of Luzon.
At 9:lo tho column got under way and
swung into East street, thence to Market.
The voiunteers and about 100 regulars
who came on the Zealandia were escorted

was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
Randolph of the Third Cavalry. The ar
tillery band headed the procession, fol

of volunteers with Colonel Kessler in com
mand. Tho band of the Thirteenth Min
nesota headed the rear guard consisting:
of the cavalry and light battery.
Market street was thronged with en
thusia-stic spectators who cheered as lone
as there was a soldier in sight. As the
procession swung into Van Ness avenue
tho Montana boys caught sight of the
Thirtieth Regiment which was marching
to the water front to board the transport
Sherman. Instantly every hat was off and
the Philippine veterans gave three rous
ing cheers for the soldiers who were going
out to finish the work begun by them.
The soldiers of the Thirtieth appreciated
this spontaneous expression of good will
and at the same time voiced their admira
tion of the Montanas In answering cheers
that crack the panes in several windows
in neighboring windows.
At Bush street and Van Ness avenue
Governor Smith and staff fell out of line
and joined Major General Shafter in re
viewing the passing soldiery. Arriving
at the camp the soldiers were taken in
charge by the men of 'the South Dakota
regiment, who had a fine lunch prepared
for them. The Montanas have been as
signed to the camp vacated by the Cali
fomlans and there they will soon be
joined by the remaining six companies
of the regiment who are coming on the

that they may be nominated. Should this

gj is the Maggie Moore-Harry Roberts Dramatic Company, and with Â«p
â¦ the exception of Miss Moorf. who claims California as her home, all the jÂ«
â¢5 members hail from Australia or New Zealand. \
<Â£ The company is composed of seventeen ladies and gentlemen who have jj

â¦ Maggie Moore's name is inseparable from the play "Struck Oil." and the â¦

The condition of Senator White has
very materially improved and he is now
able to sit up and receive visitors. When
seen last night he denied the report that
his lungs had been affected, saying that
his illness was nothing more than a bad
attack of torpid liver. He will be around
in a few days as well as ever.
Colonel Rice of the Twenty-sixth In
fantry was tendered a serenade last night
at the Occidental by the members of his
regimental band. The band consisted of
thirty-two pieces, and it rendered some
very delightful music. Colonel Rice ap

his men for the compliment they had paid
him.

CHIEF OF THE PENSION
BUREAU HERE FOR REST
GENERAL EVANS VISITS HIS SON
AT THE PRESIDIO.
The Government's Disburser Gives
Some Very Interesting Statis
tics Concerning the Magni

ment.
Among .the distinguished arrivals of yes
terday was Henry Clay Evais, United
States Commissioner of Pensions, who ar
rived from Washington and Is now a
guest of his son. Lieutenant H. C. Evans
Jr. of the Third Artillery, now at the Pre
sidio.
General Evans says he is here merely to
visit his son and to enjoy a short respite
from the constant strain of his official
duties in Washington. Though an ardent
expansionist, he will not discuss anything
pertaining to politics as he says he gets
enough of that subject at home and
wishes to leave It aside when he is out on
a vacation.
General Evans reports the bureau over
which he exercises authority as being in
an exceedingly prosperous condition, and
he gives some interesting statistics con
cerning the magnitude of the concern. The
distributions amounted last year to the
enormous sum of $13^,255,000, and it re
quired the services of a Commissioner,
fifteen chiefs of division and 1724 other
clerks to do the work.
Since the Spanish-American war there
have been 14,000 applications made and 303
allowed. This does not Include the wid
ows of the men who perished with the
Maine and who are being cared for at the
maximum rate.
General Evans will remain here about
a week and will then return East to re
sume his official duties.

UNUSUALLY LARGE AUDIENCE
CROWDS INTO THE TENTS.
Every Feature of the Show is Particu
larly Entertaining â Numbers
That Win Applause.
Walter Main's monster cirrus save its
Initial evening performance last night at
Recreation Park, corner of Sixteenth and
Folsom Btreets, and judging from the big: j
crowd that tiled Into the massive tents i
it is safe to predict that large audiences I
will be entertained at every performance, j
Every feature of the varied performance
is highly entertaining. Some of its vaude
ville features are ;ik good as if not better
than any Been here in years. The Liv
ingston family do a unique tumbling act
that wins merited applause from all sec- i
tions of the grand stands. Joe Harris' j
63-horse act is indeed marvelous.
The three La Petite brothers do a
thrilling act on the trapeze and one of
them, made up as clowns, makes a won
derful jump from the safe net to the
trapeze. LJI Perslate and nis troupe of I
performing pigs brought forth spasms of i
mingled appreciation and laughter.
Professor John H. Gill's band of thirty '
pieces furnished circus music that has no
place in the old stereotyped order that as
sails the ears days after the show has j
departed. It dispenses high-class music !
and after every piece everybody feels I
strongly tempted to applaud.
Captain Thompson's Rough Riders, all ,
of whom saw active service under Teddy-
Roosevelt in the charge up San Juan Hill
do some reckless riding and win rounds
of applause.
Mile. Burke does a toe revolving act in
midair that makes the nerves twitch and
the heart beat faster.
All in all Main's circus is the best that
has amused a San Francisco auuience in
many a year. A score of clowns are
prancing around the big- tent all the even
ing and they make more noise and cause
more genuine laughter in a minute than
a dog with a tin can tied to his tall wiuld
in a whole year.
Main's menagerie embraces every spe
cies of wild beast from performing mon
keys to the largest elephant in the world
J he sideshow is an unusually entertaining
adjunct to the big show. It contains
every known species of freak from the
midget to the fat man and the manage
ment hopes to secure before the show de
parts a man who writes names with his
fereath.

THE winter meeting of the Califor
nia Jockey Club opened yesterday
at Emeryville under conditions
which augur well for the success
of the racing season. The crowd
"was large and fashionable. There could
Hot have been the suggestion of improve
ment in the card of the day. Thousands
thronged to the track to share again In
the Incidents of excitement and enthusi
asm which mark the races. Long before
It was time for the horses to face the bar
rier for the first race the crowd thronged
through the gates. The sounds of music
could be heard from the grand stand. The
Jockeys, clad in gay costumes, loitered
about the saddling paddock. Flags were
floating from the staffs upon the build
ings. After months of idleness and silence
the racecourse had awakened to a new
season of life and Jollity, of revelry and
jjood fellowship.
The throng surged through the gates
and made its way up the long avenue to
the grand stand. Soon the area was
usurped by fashionably gowned women.
and their escorts. There was the hum of
many voices, the confusion and babel of
words and laughter. The music gave zest
to spirits already at a tension. In the
clubhouse and on the lawn in front of it
was another crowd. The carriageway was
bright with vehicles and women in holiday
attire.
Pown in the bettir ring thousands con
gregated. The clink and rattle of grold
end silver told that the bookmakers were
busy and that even' the first race had
called forth the spirit that rules the place.
There was in it all a contagious excite
ment. Men were hurrying to and fro, the
band was playing an enlivening march,
men and women were chattering and
laughing. Then out from the saddling
paddock came the dainty animals that
were to contest for the first race. The
music was silenced. A hush came over
the grand stand. Jockeys, stable boys
and track attendants climbed to the roof
of the paddock. The crowd In the area in
front of the grand stand moved forward
toward the track fence. Slowly the bar
rier was lowered and the nervous, ex
cited horses were facing it.
It was a moment of Intense excitement.
There was for almost a minute a sup
pression of feeling that was more elo
quent than expression could have been,
and then liko a flash the barrier raised
and with a bound the horses* were off.
-As if by a common impulse, the thou
sands of men and women In the grand
ptand arose to their feet. A murmur that
burst into a roar of exclamation sound
ed. Handkerchiefs and hats were wav
ing. Women, oblivious to everything but
the colors of their favorite, jumped upon
chairs and benches and cheered on the
horses that in the distance seemed like
marionettes.
Then around the turn and into the
homestretch the animals came, their
hoofs raising behind them a cloud of dust.
"Whips were flashing in the air and de
scending cruelly upon the horses' backs.
Spurs were digging sharply Into their
flanks. The excitement of the specta
tors grew more intense. The cheers be
came louder. Nearer the wire the ani
mals dashed, and then the winner bound
ed past the winning post. In another mo
ment comparative silence reigned. The
reaction came as quickly as had the im
pulse to excitement. The crowds settled
back in their seats, some with the ex
ultation of having won, others with the
disappointment of loss; many with the
satisfaction of having witnessed a good
rare well won. It was a worthy begin
ning of the racing season.
But It was only tha beginning. The

event of the day, the Opening handicap, j
was yet to take place. While thousands
of people had come in time for the first
race, other thousands were concerned
only to witness the big event of the day.
And after the first race they began to
arrive. They trooped into the grand
stand, mingling with the throngs that
were already there. And there were hun
dreds of familiar faces in the crowds,
men of affairs and women of fashion.
The second and third races were run.
Thousands of dollars passed through the
hands of the bookmakers. Everything
was life and movement and gayety. Spec
ulation and conjecture were rife. Every
body had his or her favorite for the big
event. It seemed as if the throng's spirit
of unrest entered the animals. They were
nervous, fractious and unruly at the post.
They danced in disorder before the barri. r
and with every moment of delay the great
crowd of watchers became more restless.
more excited in silent suspense. Then it
seemed as If the laboring attendants and
the Jockeys had succeeded at last in get- .
ting the animals into position.
The barrier swung upward, the horses j
bounded forward and the crowd shouted |
and applauded more in excitement than j
In approval. But then came a confused
murmur of disappointment. One horse j
had been left at the post. Back the others j
had to come for a repetition of the same
tiring f^rfnrmnnro. Again and again the j
starter strived to get the racers off on an
(.-finality. Jockeys were chlded and
warned. Horses were lashed until their
eyes flashed and their mouths became
flecked with foam. A second time the
barrier went up, but now four horses

were left at the post. The strain of delay
was telling Â»upon the excited spectators
with every moment. Then a third and
last start was made and a hoarsÂ© cry of
exultation came from the crowd. All but
one horse had been sent on the course
upon even terms. Down the track they
thundered In a bunch. In the backstretch
they faded Into automatons, the rays of
the sun flashing upon the jockeys' colors
alone giving them individuality.
Around the turn they went, and then
just as they came into the stretch one
drew gradually away from the others.
The red, white and blue stripes of the
Jockey told that it was Cromwell. A great
shout went up from the grand stand. Men
and women cheered hysterically and with
word and action urged on the leader. It
was a desperate chase, but the others
were not equal to the plunging leader In
front. Tinder the stress of spur and whip
it passed under the wire a winner. The
big event of the first day was over and
with it went much of the interest of the
spectators. But most remained for the
fifth and final race, which closed a day of
splendid sport and marked encouragingly
the beginning- of winter racing in Cali
fornia,
CROMWELL THE VICTOR.
Decisive Win of the Handicap
by Purser's Horse â Other
Winners.
By F. E. Mulholland.
Of the racing itself nothing but praise
i can be said. The finishes were close and
exciting enough to suit the most fastid
ious turfite and the sport throughout
above taint of suspicion. Libertine at
odds on, Constellator and Mt. McGregor
II were the fallen favorites that caused
j the talent to sigh.
The opening handicap, at a mile, at
tracted a field of nine to the post and
was one of the prettiest contests from
a spectacular standpoint ever witnessed
at the track across the bay. Cromwell,
the victor, ridden in matchless style by
Charley Macklin, was neglected in the
rush to get aboard Mt. McGregor 11. the
entry of Burns & Waterhouse, which,
with Thorpe in the saddle, was played
down to 6to 5 favoritism. Unfortunately,
the stylish bay horse broke down with
the goal almost within reach, and the
turf has probably seen him for the last
time. Eddie Greaney and his friends
again pinned their faith and dollars on
the chances of Rosinante, and although
the mare run a superb race, met with
hard racing luck. Lost Girl, Jennie Reid
and The Fretter were not wanting for
admirers either.
At the post fully twenty minutes were
consumed before Ferguson swished his
flag to a start, owing chiefly to the ob
stinate antics of Lost Girl, Mamie G and
the favorite. Rounding the first turn there
was considerable crowding, during which
Thorpe found the largest opening and had
the favorite in front turning into the back
stretch, with Monrovia and Cromwell at
his heels. Overanxious, Mounce on The
Fretter now pulled up on even terms with
the leader, the pair racing head and head
to the stretch. A furlong from home, with
the field well bunched, the result seemed
In doubt, Mt. McGregor, The Fretter,
Mamie G and Rosinante all looking to
have a chance. McGregor cracked first
and opposite the paddock Cromwell drew
away, winning cleverly by a length. In
a fierce drive The Fretter lasted just long
enough to take the place from the fast
coming Rosinante. Hohenzollern never
seemed to get in his stride and his show-
Ing was probably a false one. The win
ner carried top weight and will be hard
to beat if he retains his form.
At the very outset in the five-furlong
scramble for two-year-olds Constellator,
a piping-hot choice, was downed a short
head by Druidess, the second choice.
Eddie Jones on the latter was quickest
to get his horse in motion and maintain
ing his advantage to the wire earned the
verdict In the hardest kind of a drive,
fairly outfinlshing Morse. John Millin ran
third.
It looked as if only a long delay at the
post could beat the fretful Midlove out
(if the second purse. Fortunately for her
backers, who accepted a short price, Fer
guson sent them away at the first line
up and the result was never in doubt, the
favorite winning hands down from Clar

ando. February gave it up a furlong
from the stand.
Galen Brown will probably have to try'
his old stand-by, Libertine, at the sprint
ing distances, for the big bay seems to
be no longer able to negotiate a route.
Backed down to a 3 to 4 favorite he fin
ished third in a mile and a sixteenth with
but four starting. Possessed of early
i speed he cried quits at the stretch turn.
Fortis, piloted by Jack Ward and look
| ing hopelessly out of it at the start, won
hands down from Oralbee in the sail
home.
The concluding six furlong sprint went
to the favorite. Panamint, ridden by
Thorpe. Good Hope, the entry of Caesar
! Young, gave the winner a hard argument
for two-thirds of the journey and then
I finished second. Ruiz, who seems to have
I grown rusty, was third on Socialist.
TRACK NOTES.
' Nearly all of the books laid away some
money. The firms chalking prices were:
Johnny Humphrey, Schwartz & Co.,
Caesar Young of St. Louis, Oakland Club,
Phil Archibald, Hoffman & Co., Golden
Gate Club and Harlan & Co. Two field
books, in charge of Jerry Driscoll with
Sam Shaen and Billy Huber as block men,
accommodated the smaller bettors.
A telegram was received by the Oakland
Association yesterday from Ed Smith,
presiding in the stand at Stockton, stating
that Jockey Tullet had been ruled off the
turf. Tullet was charged with getting
left at the post on the horse McFarlane
in a race run at the Slough City on Fri
day.

and Panamint did not swell Billy's bank
roll to any noticeable extent.
While at the post on Rosinante in the
handicap Eddie Jones received a hard
kick on the leg that probably did not
improve his riding qualities.
Before racing began the riders were all
cautioned that they would have to line
their mounts up at the barrier, and any
violation of this rule would t-arn a line or
suspension. Ferguson's starts were all
that could be desired.
Clarence Waterhouse of the firm of
Burns & Waterhouse left some good fish
ing and hunting grounds in the northern
part of the State, where he has been rusti
cating, to be present opening day.
The Sacramento and Oakland races have
been issued In handy pamphlet form by
Egbart & Skinner, publishers of the Offi
cial Turf Guide.
Cromwell, winner of the handicap, nar
rowly escaped being cut down at the first
turn, a chunk being gouged out of one of
his hind legs.
The Daily Racing News, a gossipy turf
sheet, resumed business again last even
ing with the opening of the turf season.
Herman Hoffman, the popular St. Louts
layer of odds, arrived yesterday morn-
Ing just In time to cut In.
After a loner siege of what is termed
hard luck, "Curly" Shields broke the ice
by capturing a purse with Fortis. He
was congratulated by his many friends,
who hope the hoodoo has disappeared.
Lost Girl has been showing some very
smart trials on the track mornings, and
getting left at the post was a sad blow to
the mare's admirers.
Colonel Dan Burns is very sweet on
Mt. McGrpgor and after the latter's mis
hap yesterday will probably retire the
big bay horse to the stud.

"THE GADFLY"
SEEMS TO BE
A MISNOMER,
"The Gadfly" In dramatized form has
been tried In Providence (ere this in New
York) and apparently found wanting.
When dramatization was talked of and
Stuart Robson's name mentioned as a
possible Gadfly, failure was predicted be
cause of Robson. . An actor with a half
century record as a comedian was at
tempting something that could but end
in disaster for play and actor. When
Ernest Hastings, erstwhile leading man
of the Alcazar, was chosen for Monta
nelll onÂ© could but stop and wonder what
dictated the'cholce. No one will ever ac
cuse Hastings, pre-eminently, an actor of
repression, of cither tragic or emotional
strengthâ the learning of his lints seemi 5
always to absorb most of his dramatic
fire. What could be the outcome, then,
with the leading parts thus woefully mis
pi yen? The dramatist it seems has set
tled all this.
The novel, written at whitÂ© heat, with
the savage (which is the real self in any
creation) well to the front in every ag
gressive and sinister speech, proved a
sensation to the agnostic, a shock to the
most liberal minded; a violent, a terrific
shock to the religious. Religion, let one
be thankful, is the one thing that shall
not be seriously trifled with on the stage.
In its original virility, the story would
not be tolerated by any audience, and
in eliminating the agnosticism, the bit
terness, the irony, the religiously offen
sive and the final crashing climax, the
motive of the book has been changed and
the Gadfly converted into a pathetic
figure, retaining the original halt in
speech and walk. In fact, the dramatist
seems to have come to his task in a gen
tle, conventional mood. And the most de
vout, it is said, will find llttlo or noth
ing to offend him from rise to fall of
curtain. Robson and Hastings seem to
have been quite equal to their tasks. The
third act was mildly applauded, but the
rest of the play was received almost In
silence. Mrs. Voynich has strenuously
objected to the method of treatment and
threatened, so rumor has It. to prevent
its production in New York. As the work
â tands, it may be a play. New York may
reverse the decision of Providence, but
whatever the result, It is not "The Gad
fly," for "The Gadfly" is not likely to be
a' play in our day and generation.
Local Journalists who enjoy taking a
rise out of the critics would have had a
merry time of it had they been writing
for the Canadian papers during Mrs.
Fluke's recent performance of Becky
Sharp. Some of the criticisms were unin
tentionally most humorous. Two openly
accuse Mrs. Flske of making Becky a real
bad woman and a third darkly hints at
the same flaw. Th*>re may b* others that
have not come to light. Ye gods and little
fishes! Who ever said or thought she was
good? If Thackeray had any intentions
of painting her in the llrht of anything
but embodied and pretty successful wick
edness he perfectly concealed his inten
tions.
And talking of critics brings to mind the
fact that those of the East have taken to
calling the Herald's latest acquisition
"Clement Scott of England," fencing, no
doubt, to thrust the heart. Now it seems
to me were I writing for a London Jour
nal (this is merely an interjection, not the
remotest possible contingency), I should
swell with patriotic pride were I dubbed
"Susan Haskins of America." But. then,
of course, America is America.
Henry Miller has made the success of
his career as Sidney Carton In "The Only
Way " a dramatization of "A Tale of Two
Cities" by Freeman Wills, a brother of
the more famous English playwright.
Kew York believed In the play, for It came
stamped as a London Miccera, but she
questioned the Judgment of Mr. Frohman
In intrusting to Mr. Mlllrr thf> rolf> created
by Martin Harvey. Preiudfrnent Is a
good thing sometimesâ mark Â«ji effort for
disapproval and the determined dog in the
man will dig to the renter of things or
outwit you. New York has been slow, so
slow, In according Mr. Miller his plaoe as
a star, but his performance In "The Only
Way" Is recorded a triumph for play and
star. Miller Is spoken of as "the Carton
of Dickens' creation, and, with Wills'
additional material to work with, appre
ciably more." San Francisco discovered
and willingly acknowledged the artist in
Mr. Miller without being shocked into the
admission through the medium of an op
portunity like Carton. Neither Mr. Miller
nor Mr. Frohman has reason to regTCt
thÂ© summer experiment.

YACHTING: Gadder Wins Challenge Cup.
FIELD EVENTS: World Records Beaten.
BASEBALL: Sacramento 6, Oakland 4.
GADDER IS
VICTOR IN
YACHT RACE
Wins the Challenge Trophy
Cleverly for the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club.
After a close, and Interesting race yes
terday, afternoon the yacht Gadder de
feated the lruani by one minute and
fifty-eight seconds, corrected time, and
won the Perpetual Challenge Cup for the
San Francisco Yacht Club. The . result
of the race: surprised everybody, the win
ners as much as the losers. The winning
boat Is certainly not a beauty. With her
: blackleaded hull and stern like a dry
i goods box she did not compare favorably
â  with the trim, graceful lines and spot
lessly white body of the Truant.
At 12:50 p. m. the steamer Caroline,
which carried the members of the regatta
committee, the referee, timers and invited
guests, sounded a preparatory signal and
at 1 clock the starting whistle was
given. The Truant was hovering .about
near the line and crossed it one minute
and fifty-two seconds after the signal.
The Gadder crossed nearly seven minutes
later, at eight minutes and forty-eight
: seconds after the whistle. Ex-Commodore !
; V. . N. McCarthy, who sailed the Gadder, i
kept closer to .the shore than ex-Cor- '
modore J. W. Pew, who handled the :
Truant's helm. The tide was Hooding and â 
the breeze only moderate at the start and
the Gadder seemed rather slow in stays i
and not very speedy. The wind kept
freshening and as it grew stronger it was
Been how closely she pointed and that she ,
stood up under her canvas quite stiilly.
In the run to Blossom Rock buoy the
challenger and defender were practically
even; the former gaining only 3 seconds. ',
At the Reward Btakeboat 'Â»â¢ Gadder had
gained 23 seconds, and when she rounded â¢
the windward mark for th second time,
9 minutes and 30 seconds later than the i
Truant, the hopes of the San Franciscos j
rose high. As the Gadder started 6 mm- :
utes and 56 seconds later than the Truant I
and received from her a time allowance
of 3 minutes and 46 seconds, the Truant
had to cross the finishing line 10 minutes
and 43 seconds earlier to beat her. When j
the Truant crossed the finishing line at
22 Seconds past 4 o'clock, and the Gadder I
was seen running home "like a scared j
dog," it seemed a sure victory for the
San Franciscos' boat. So it proved. On
the Gadder came and crossed a winner
at 9 minutes and 6 seconds past 4. or 1
minute and 50 seconds, corrected time, |
ahead of the loser. The actual sailing
time of the winner was 3 hours and 10
seconds, and of the loser 2 hours 50 min
utes and 30 seconds; so the race was won
on time allowance.
The times of starting, rounding the
marks and of finishing, with actual and
corrected times, were as follows:
P. M.
Truant crossed starting line at 1:01:52
Gadder crossed starting line at 1:08:48

CLOSING DAY OF THE
STOCKTON RACE MEET
STOCKTON, Sept. 23.â The final day of
the race meet brought out a good-sized
crowd to witness the racing. Four heats
i were required in each of the principal
harness race* to get a decision and there
were {several close finishes and consider
j able betting on every trial. The surprise
i of the day occurred when Martha Whips
reduced her record seven seconds by mak
ing the circuit in 2:10?; when she was
formerly eligible to the 2:18 class.
Ike Tullet, the jockey who accepted sjo
from Ah Chuck to anchor Mcl-arlane at
the post on Thursday, was ruled off the
association tracks for life.
The bookies had a crimp put in their
bank rolls in the fifth event when the
heavily played favorite, Colonel Dan,
galloped home a city block in front of a
bunch of cracks. Summaries:

RACE FOR A CHALLENGE CLP.
Contrary to all expectations, the Gad
der, representing the San Francisco Yacht
Club, defeated the Corinthian Club's Tru
ant yesterday. The race was for the
Perpetual Challenge cup, which has been
in possession of the Corinthians slnco
1897. They will endeavor to regain the
trophy next year.
ton's yacht Shamrock sailed one of the
most satisfactory trial spins she has yet
had. There was not much windward
work in it, but with the wind abeam she
covered the distance from Scotland light
ship to a mark off Elberon in an hour
ami eight minutes. The reach-back was
made In an hour and twelve minutes,
about twenty-five miles in two hours and
twenty minutes, or at the rate of nearly
twelve miles an hour.
The yacht carried her club topsail
throughout the trial, although her lee rail
was often awash. During the first half
of the course it took her nearly five min
utes to pass one of the crack schooners
of the fishing fleet which met her outside.
Casting off the towline near Sandy Hook
at 10:35 Captain Hogarth sent the Sham
rock over toward the Long Island shore
and put her through a preliminary spin
for an hour and fifteen minutes while
waiting for the Erin to come out.
As soon as Designer Fife went aboard
the trial began In earnest. The start was
made from the Scotland lightship at ll:o0.
The outer mark off Elberon was rounded
at 12:58. Then the yacht was put on the
other tack and with sheets broad off to
port she miule f;tst time back to the fin
ish line, crossing it at 2:10. The Sham
rock's crew will have a rest to-morrow
and trials will be resumed for three days
of next week.
COLUMBIA'S SAILS.
Mr. Iselin Declares He Is Satisfied
With Their Fit.
BRISTOL, R. 1., Sept. 23.â T0-day was
a busy one for every man aboard the
yacht Columbia, Early this morning she
went out for a practice and Ball-stretch
ing spin and ran back to her moorings
again at noon. After dinner the sails
were taken ashore to the sail loft and an
other main sail taken out to the yacht.
The crew bent on the sail, which was
hoisted up to Us full height. Later the
club topsail and a jib topsail were sent
up for inspection. A number of other
sails were taken ashore In order that
some slight alterations might be made.
About 6:30 the mainsail was lowered and
covered and the staysail and Jibs set up
In stops.
Quite a lot of sails with small spars
were put on the tender St. Michael this
afternoon and the probability is that the
Columbia will leave here Sunday or Mon
day for New Rochelle. Mr. Iselln will
go to Newport on the St. Michael to
morrow and later in the day will continue
on to New Rochelle. The set of the sails
on the Columbia Is aJmost perfect and
Mr. Iselln Is satined with them.

Goes to Join "Tom" Sharkey.
Tim McGrath leaves for New York to
night to join Tcm Sharkey, the boxer. He
Is accompanied by Frank McConnell and
FTank Rafael. The party will spend a
day in Denver and another In Chicago en
route. McConnell expects a match with
Charlie McKeever, whom he defeated In
this city. McKeever Is anxious for a re
turn match, and as he is popular in the
East it is looked upon as a good drawing
card. Rafael Is willing to meet any of
the 135-pound men, of whom there are a
large number near New York.
McGrath, who is one of the best trainers
of boxers In the country, will help con
dition Sharkey for his forthcoming meet
ing with Jeffries. He quotes Sharkey'3
long list of victories and expresses un
bounded confidence in the sailor's ability
to wrest the world's championship from
Jeffries.
Shrimp-Fishers Arrested.
The Fish and Game Commissioners yes
terday received word from Deputy John
Davis that he had arrested five Chinese
fishermen for violating the law in catch
ing small smelt. The arrest Is really for
the protection of the shrimp of the upper
bay, which the Chinese take In their small
mesh nets by the ton. At every haul they
destroy thousands of the young of all
kinds of fish. The illegal fishers were
found near McNears Landing and taken
to Sausallto, as it seems to be impossible
to secure a conviction before the Justice
of the Peace of San Rafael, no matter
how conclusive the evidence may be. Jus
tice Bellude will try the cases In ques
tion.
DUDES LOSE
GAME IN THE
NINTH INNING
Plenty of Errors, Few Hits and
Bad Umpiring at the Base
bali Game.
Sacramento 6, Oakland 4.
Sacramento won the game In the ninth
inning yesterday afternoon, and Dun
leavy, who CQvered the middle bae for
Oakland. Is responsible for the winning
runs which gave the Senators the game.
The score was of the kind that make*
an interesting contest. At the end of the
sixth both Dudes and Senators were la
beled with a brace of runs. The Beventb
inning brought them two apiece, and the
eighth was fruitleds. Errors on thÂ«
Dudes' part in the ninth was the cause
of their losing the match, and all the ex
planations which Cal Ewlng has beer,
pouring into the ears of the friends who
had money to scotch on Oakland cannot
get away from this fact.
Harper twirled for Oakland and Harvey
for the beveled gold-edged men from the
capital, 'fh it the game lasted over two
hours was due to tne excruciating slow
ness of Air. Harvey of Sacramento. Be
fore he pitched the ball he wont through
mental operations that drove the specta
tors Into spasms of indignation.
In the llm inning this same Harvey
scored. A single gave him lirst and lie
took two bags on ,i fair hit by O'Connor.
Stanley then drove a hot one to Dunleavy,
whose mits wort- covered with axle
grease yesterday, and Harvey, the
"Slow," scon (1.
From the Hrsi to tho fourth there wasn't
much of anything that caused palpitations
'â r cardiac Uutterings. In this inning Oak
land worked a brace of runs to its credit.
Hammond made the first station on a
bunt and was propelled to third on Har
dies two-bagger. Donovan tried the bunt
act and the ball rolled slowly to Harvey,
who threw to Stanley at home, but not in
tin,.- to prevent Hammond from scoring.
HardJe took third while all this
was transpiring and Donovan was
safe at first. Harvey thought he
could end the game at this point, as Dr.n
leavy and Hutchlnsen had been given
epitaphs, by catching Donovan napping
at first. He was wrong-, for when he
throw the ball to O'Connor, Donovan took
second and Hardle scored.
In the sixth Harvey scored for Sacra
mento and the score was two all. The
seventh brought two runs to both teams.
A hit by Harvey to Mosklman, who
dropped tho ball after a hard run in, al
lowed Shanahan and Shechan to cross
the plate. When Oakland came to bat it
looked as if .something fruitful would
happen. A two-bagger by Dunleavy and
a hit by Schmeer gave the former an
earned run. There was a very rank de
cision on the next play and Mr. Long will
be held in disrepute for it. Mosklman hit
to Eagan, who really threw him out at
first, but the Czar said safe and SchmeiT
pmred on the. play. The board then read
four runs all.
This is how the game was won. Stultz
perished and She^han hunted to Harper,
who threw wildly to first and made tho
best of a bad thing by appropriating sec
ond. Then Mclaughlin hit to Dun
leaty. who threw wildly to Hutchlnsen
and Sheehan scored. Harvey waa the
next that perished and after "him came
O'Conner, who hit to left and Mclaugh
lin scored. Oakland did not have a
chance when they came to bat and the
game was over.

JUANITA A
SURPRISE AT
UNION PARK
D. Ford's Black Greyhound
Defeats Brutus Handily
at 20 to J.
There was hardly a ripple of excite..
nr>nt at T'nion Coursing Park yesterday
until the day's was nearly ai
end. The fireworks came when Juanltn,
a rank outsider, beat J. P. Thrift's great
dop Brutus. The course Was ? n appar
ently one-sided that the leather-lung.-d
poolseliers could tlnd no one willing to
bet on the short end. The odds lenpth
ened gradually until. In derision, an offer
of 30 to 1 was made. Two tickets were
written at these odds and two more at
15 to 1. This constituted the betting on
the course.
When the clogs were slipped Brutus.
as was expected, led off and secured the
first turn. He could not kill, but plaeÂ« <1
his opponent, which ran up a formida
ble score rapidly, winning finally by a
big margin. The bettors who follow tho
fortunes of the short enders were aston
ished. There was a buzz of comment
about the betting ring which did not sub
side for some time. Fuel was added to
the flame when Magnesia defeated Be
troniua at odds of 1 to 4.
The hares were an exceptionally strong
lot. many escaping after leading the flogs
a long chase. Primrose beat Bart's Be!!u
by a score of 30 to *>. Master Clair beat
Fleetfoot. 22 to 7. Primrose Jerome bviit
Swedish in a grand course after a "no
go." In the run "if an extra dog was
released. There was a hot tip out on
Sleety Mist the best of the Australian
dogs, to beat "Hoot Mon" Brskine's Lav
ender. The latter was strongly played,
but apparently has not recovered from
her severe run In the Produce stake. Mist
led up, turned and killed, although Lav
ender was always in the running.
The attendance was small, but the usual
Sunday throng is expected to-day, when
the dogs will be better matched, the
poorer ones being eliminated yesterday.

QUEER DEAL IS
WHICH MILLER
LOST A HOME
Charges the Girvins
With Fraud.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 23.
If the allegations made In a complaint
filed In the Superior Court this afteYnoon
by J. W. Miller, formerly of Los Angeles,
against Viola I. and J. W. Girvln, Belle
Llstman, James S. Xalsmtth, F. T.
Young and otners, prove incontrovertible
facts, he relates a most interesting story
of how he was bunkoed out of a com
fortable home in the Southern City of
Angels.
The complaint, prepared by Attorney
William Lair Hill, recites that on De
cember 20. 18^S. the following contract
was entered into between Miller and thÂ«
Glrvini:
Wile-ox Building. Los Angeles, Cal.,
December 20, ls%\â We hereby mu
tually agree 10 exchange our proper
ties. The property '<t the first party
situated on Cuuremont avenue, Berke
ley, comprising about three and one
half acres, nine-room house, barn, out
houses, tank house, etc., known &6
property of Viola I. Glrvln.
The property of. the second party
situated on 1250 West Washington
street, known as the property of J.
W. Miller, situated in Los Angeles,
each property subject to present in
curabrances. J. W. GIRVIX
(for Viola I. Girvln),
J. W. MILLER.
On Miller's property there was a
mortgage held by William Quay and the
latter had secured a decree of foreclos
ure in the cum of $3Â£79, but the time for
redemption had not expired on December
20 and, according to Miller's complaint, [
were apprised of these facts. I
<>n the Girvin property Samuel W. j
carpenter held a mortgage for $4500, and |
the value of both properties, over and
above the incumbrances. was about J3uoo.
At the time the contract was made the
Alameda County property of Viola stood i
In the name of Belle Gould, who is the ,
same person as defendant l-ielle Listman,
who held in secret trust for her sister,
Viola.
Placing Implicit confidence In the mu
tual agreement. Miller avers that he exe
cuted deeds to his property to the Gir
vins, but the latter failed to reciprocate,
for when Miller had shipped his furniture
and household goods to Berkeley and his
family appeareo at their prospective new
home in Clareniont avenue "to take pos
session, In pursuance of the contract,
Viola appeared also and refused to allow !
them to place their furniture in the house I
and by declaration? and throats intlml- '
dated the plaintiffs family and finally
drove them away," says the complaint.
Plaintiff further alleges that the Gir- j
vms now also have possession of his Los |
Angeles property and that defendants. I
Naismith & Young, as the Girvins' I
agents, refuse to permit him or his family ;
10 return to and occupy said former home.
Miller therefore charges that the ne
gotiations were made simply to defraud
him out of his property and he asks the j
court to decree that the Girvins df-llv^r
to him a good and sufficient deed to the
Berkeley property; that B>lle Listman be
declared t<> hold no Interest whatever in
?ald premises and that plaintiff be im
mediately let into possession of the home
it Berkeley.

BERKELEY SECURES
A STAR HALFBACK
BERKELEY. Sept. 23.â The football
men of the University of California are
congratulating themselves upon a recent
; addition to the number of candidates for
' the Varsity team. After several attempts
made by Manager Muma of the University

The new player haÂ» already an enviable
reputation for work upon the gridiron.
'â  He was the star halfback of Hi.ltt s school
team in 1897 and showed up to line advan
tage in a match game with the Berkeley
freshman that year. He played with
"Locomotive" Smith when both were un
dergraduates at Hoitfs together and was
: there considered in no way inferior to the
I iatteT.
After graduating from the preparatory
; school Garrison went to the Philippines
as a private in Company B of the First
; California Volunteers. He served all the
1 time his regiment was in Manila and
I donned his civilian clothes yesterday for
! the first time in sixteen months. He is
[ now regularly entered as a freshman of
! the University of California and will come
1 out upon the gridiron at once.

NOISE, MUSIC AND LIGHT
Electric Display by the Municipality
Was One of the Prominent
Features of the Occa
sion.
ALAMEDA, Sept. ffl.-Thla city extend
ed a welcome to-night to the members of
the First California Regiment whose
homes are in Alameda, and all the town
turned out to do justice to tha occasion.
The cheers of the citizens as the boys
marched through the main streets, es
corted by Company G, N. G. C, rent the
air, while the glare of red fire burning
from every housetop and every street cor
ner dimmed the electric lights that
sparkled all over the city, and the bang
of firecrackers and bombs almost equaled
the noise from Dewey's guns when they
were engaged In reducing the Spanish
fleet at Manila Bay.
The reception was an admirably man
aged affair. There was a spontaneous
outburst of approval from all quarters
when the celebration was suggested, and
the determination to impress upon the
boys that the welcome was sincere and
that the city was really glad that they
were home again from the war per
vaded the atmosphere of the Kncinal City.
Welcome, was In the air. The perfume of
the flowers breathed a welcome, and the
citizens went home hoarse from shouting.
The programme consisted of a public
demonstration at the Thompson grounds
and a banquet to the soldier boys at Arm
ory Hall.
The parade formed on Park street. The
Alameda concert band led the way, fol
lowed by the committee-, which had been
intrusted by the citizens with arranging
the details of the reception. Next came
Compaay G, in command of Captain M.
W. Simpson, acting as an escort of honor
to the returned heroes. The volunteers
to whom the welcome was extended con
sisted of the following members of the
First California Regiment: Major Charles
L. Tilden, Captain J. W. Dumbrell, Ser
geants B. Hawks, B. H. Hawks, J. C.
Hawks, Corporal A. P. Smiley, E. D.
Crowley, P. W. Field, F. H. Field, F. A.
Lrouis, J. P. Marshall, O. C. Meyer, P. L.
Crosby, D. F. de Bernardl, Louis Graham,
F. A. Bordewell, Rushton McConnell, Ed
Anderson and w. B. Sedgley.
The march was along Park street to
Central avenue, to High street, to the
Thompson grounds, where the first for
mal words of welcome were extended to
the boys who had worn the blue.
A surging mass of humanity filled thÂ«
streets through which the procession
passed and fell in behind the marching
soldiers and headed for the Thompson
grounds. The scene there was most pic
turesque. The vast throng gathered be
neath the tall, spreading cypress trees in
front of a stand erected under a giant
oak. Incandescent lights sparkled from
amid the branches, giving the place the
appearance of a fairy Christmas festival.
A huge American flag, worked in electric
lights, blazed far above the speakers'
stand. The exercises here were brief but
full of expressions of patriotism and
abounded in outbursts of enthusiasm.
The electric display was one- of the feat
ures of the celebration. It was the city's
donation and was arranged by thÂ© city
electrician, G. A. Weise.
As soon as he could be heard above the
shouting of the wildly glad crowd, Chair
man C. L, Robinson opened the pro
gramme. He said:
No spot In all the world Is no dear to the
heart and so cherished as home. Whert war
â was declared these boys of ours tore away
from loving Rrins to answer the call of patri
otism. They are back to us with a record of
duty well performed and with the glory of be
ing honorably discharged from their country's
service. These boys have been wined and dined
since they returned to California'? shores, but
it remains for the people of their own Alameda
to extend the welcome that will touch their
hearts and bedim thÂ«ir eyes with tears of Joy.
Colonel Charles A. Sumner delivered
the address of the evening. He spoke as
follows:
There la welcome In the air to-night from

CIRCUS MAN IS SHOT
BY A BARTENDER
Charles White Wounded by S. Loven
thal in a Saloon on Kearny
Street.
Charles White, who Is connected with
the circus, entered the Campfire saloon
at SlO Kearny street last night and got
Into an altercajjon with W. M. Sears, the
proprietor. The latter, believing himself
in danger, called to M. F. Loventhal his
barkeeper, for help, and the latter rushed
to his employer's assistance. White upon
reinforcements coming, drew a pocket-
Knife and rushed at the barkeeper
Loventhal, seeing his own life In dan
ger, pulled a revolver and llred five shots
at his assailant, one of which inflicted a
slight scalp wound. The wound did not
deter White from continuing the fight
and as he again rushed forward Loven
thal hit him over the head with a billiard
cue, felling him to the floor.
Officers Tom Flynn and McGrayan who
were attracted by the shots, arrived on
the scene and placed the participants un
der arrest.
While was hurriedly Bent to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where it was found that
he had suffered two scalp wounds but
was not in dang-er of losing his life. Lov
enthal "was removed to the California
street station, where a charge of assault
to commit murder was placed against
him. The barkeeper declared that he shot
because his life was threatened.
A few months ago Mrs. Loventhal was
struck over the head with a bottle in the
same saloon by a soldier and died in
stantly. The- murderer's trial comes up
to-morrow.
Fell From a Fire Escape.
Andrew McCreery, a young attorney,

tion and removed to his home at 511 Ma

SENATOR CARTER HONORED.
The rooms of the Union League Club
were filled to the doors yesterday after
noon with men of national repute who
had gathered to attend the informal re
ception given In honor of Senator Carter,
Montana's able representative In tha
councils of the nation.
General N. P. Chipman, president of tha
club, acted as chairman, and In a few well
chosen words Introduced the Senator to
those of the guests with whom he was
not already acquainted.
Senator Carter acknowledged the pre
sentation and then delivered n pro-expan
sion address, which he brought to a con
clusion by thanking the people of Cali
fornia and this city In particular for the
hospitality and courtesy with which they
had received the Montana delegation and
for the solicitude they had shown in look-
Ing after the comfort of the returned
Montana volunteers.
Following Senator Carter came M. H.
de Young, M. M. Estee, Colonel John P.
Jackson, Julius Kahn and a number of
others, each of whom had something to
say in compliment of tho famous states
man they had gathered to greet.
When the speechmaklng had been
brought to a close all present were Intro
duced to the Senator, after which tho
meeting broke up into little groups and
conversation of a general and pleasant
character passed away the balance of tho
time.
Among the distinguished gentlemen
present was General Henry Clay Evans,
United States Commissioner of Pensions.
CONVICTS SENTENCED.
George F. Trueworthy, who killed John
Landsman on the night of June 11 last,
and who was convicted of murder in tha
second degree, was sentenced to ten
years' imprisonment in San Quentin by
Judge Cook yesterday morning. As the
dead man provoked the quarrel that led
to his death at the hands of Trueworthy

for the offense provided by the law.

burglary in the second degree, was
sentenced to two years and six months
imprisonment in San Quentin.

The Pacific Coast Railroad Club held Its
regular monthly meeting last night in the
conservatory of the Palace Hotel. About
fifty members were present and T. J.

Two papers were read, one by C. C.
Borton on "Sharp Flanges, Causes and
Remedies," and the other by T. J. Hen
derson, an engineer of the Valley Road,
was entitled "Compound Locomotives.
Both papers were of great interest to
those present as was evinced by the dis
cussion they evoked when the questions
of which they treated were thrown open
*for debate.
The next regular meeting will take
place three weeks from yesterday and
will be devoted to a continuation of tha
same subjects.
Bicycle Thief Captured.
Richard Clarke, a young bicycle thief,
was arrested last night by Detective Tom
Ryan after a short chase and lodged In

I tective Ryan was in the vicinity of Third
! and Howard streets last night and saw
j the young man trying to dispose of the
wheel in the pawnshops along that street.
As soon as Clarke spied the officer he

The Hay Market.
The circular of Scott & Magner says: Re

Â£630 tons. The market has continued along In
a rather Hi â â¢â :â â .-.: condition for the past
ten days, during which time there has been no
j articular changes to note. While arrivals
have continued heavy, we have been filling up
barns cf consumers who are buying for win
tor use. Movement of consigned Hay has been j
eaticfactory and prices have varied at times
from lay to day, but no definite changes in j
values have taken place since our last report.
There la much movement oÂ£ Hay expected here
during the n^xt few weoks to clear the fields.
Shipments are baily delayed on account of the j
scarcity ( : both water and rail transportation
faculties.
Alialfa Hayâ Arrivals this week have con
tinued heavy. There has been considerable
dif.iculty m obtaining boats to freight tha
Hiver Alfalfa, and this perhaps has been a
fact' r in not overcrowding the market of late.
Prices are unchanged and steady.

Dried Fruit in New York.
Mail advices from New York ray:
The close of the season for some varieties
of domestic fruits has created a larger de- j
mand for dried fruit, which will Increase sales.
Distributers are Importunate in their de
rr.anis, and some enlargement in orders is an
ticipated.
Pruned re meeting with stronger consump
tive demand, but no larger request has been
noted as yet. Scales are limited to caxlots, or.
In extreme casi-s, two and three carlotn. The
request from distributers will unquestionably
compel buyers to enlarge their orders, and
moro active trading may be expected this week.
Prices Mill ru!.' at Be, with 2%c bid. It seems
probabla that buyers will be compelled to ac
cept the Inevitable and raise their bids to 3c
to enable then to get the t-tock required.
Peaches are weak and prices are relatively
low. Demand is small and alined to retail
orders. No one wants to buy under present
conditions. Neither is th^re any pressure to
eel!, but the probability is that trade will ta
prove shortly, a/id that Bales will be more
liberal.
A]>rk-cts are firm, and the only buyers ap
poar to be exporters.

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. 23.â Tho tono of the trail-
Ing in stock* was quiet by comparison with
the recent excited temper on the Exchange,
but the local traction Bt< dv continued to re
flect a decidedly uncertain frame of mind.
Brooklyn Transit refused to go up more than a
point, and then clipped below last nteht's" level.
Its extreme dc-elmo wan 5 points, and even with
a final rally of covering by shorts its net
lots Is I points. Metropolitan fared better and
haa a gain over 2. The other New York city
etocks fell off in sympathy with Brooklyn
Transit, .-md the stock* of the Flower group
were Inclined to weakness all around. There
was no marked strength at any time. The
early advance was nominally In sympathy
with the hope expresued In Borne quarters
abroad that tho Transvaal question would find
a peaceful solution after all. Earlier gains had
be*n very generally wiped out when the bank
statement appeared. The first effect of the
btatement was a rally due to buying by those
who never look further than the surplus re
serve figures. An analysis of the statement
failed to develop any very encouraging feature
In It, and prices fell away again to the low
est of the day and closed there, except for a
few specialties, which rallied.
Much was made sarly In the week of a plan
Â©/relief for the stringency of money by an
Increase of national bank circulation. It -will
be observed that the total Increase of circula
tion according to the statement amounts to
but â¢; 900 for the week. Furious speculative
activity and excitement have made heavy deal
ings on the Stock Exchange all week. The
[ obviouÃ necessity disclosed by last Saturday's
bank statement for a contraction of loans by
the banks prepared the professional stock oper
ators to take advantage of the forced llquida
; tlon of speculative holdings of stocks which
had been bought on a margin with borrowed
money. The professional operators were all
bears and took the market away from the
longs as quickly as the pressure of liquidation
manifested Itself in any onÂ« spot. The course
: of prices indicated pretty clearly that the call
ing of loans was made with marked discrim
: ination against the industrial stocks. The mar
gin of collateral on loans in which the secur
ities figured was broadened as well as the rate
of Interest being marked up. In many cases
the loans were called outright, only to be re
placed after the collateral had been shifted
into more substantial securities. The violent
fluctuations In Brooklyn Transit had an In
evitable effect on other securities more or less
allied to It by common ownership of securities.
The proportions of the dealings In Brooklyn
Transit have, perhaps, never been equaled in
the history of any other stock In the same
period of time. In two weeks past the num
ber of shares of this stock sold on the Ex
change foots up to a total or almost four times
as great as the total share issue of the com
pany. The fact Is beginning to emerge that
a contest 19 on between some of the most pow
erful financial Interests in the country for the
control of some or all of the public utilities
and franchises of Greater New York. The
contest has been open and fierce for many
months in the gas business of the city, and
belief In Wall street Is that the same elements
are engaged In contending for the control of
the street railway corporations. The eagerness
of the boar element" among professional opera
tors resulted in overer.tending the short ac
count, and the demand to cover became rather
urpent. There was some relief from the
earlier anxiety over the money outlook as the
week progressed, based on various causes. The
large contraction of loans was sufficient to In
sure a material decrease in deposit liabilities
by the bank, and the outgo of money showed
a falling off, both to the interior and to the
Sub-Treasury. The purchase of $500,000 in gold
in the London market for shipment to New
York, though it would not be vouched for by
any one in Wall street, had an influence on
Stock Exchange sentiment, as It was doubtless
intended it should. The downward course of
foreign exchange excites expectation of an
early export movement of gold, though foreign
bankers rather deprecate the expectation.
There Is Still existing a snort interest in
sterling exchange which makes a good de
mand for belated cotton bills, which are now
coming forward more freely. Last September
the surplus reserve of the New York banks
i fell below $;,000,0C0 on September 17, and loan
I contraction and liquidation on the Stock Ex
i change pet in with a stiffening of the call loan
rat's to 6 per cent. By the end of the month
I call loans had dropped back to below 2 per
cent, and surplus reserves had risen to about
05,000,000. But last September the Treasury
added to Its deposits with depository banks
the sum of nearly $15,000/100 In connection with
the payment of subscriptions to the new Gov
ernment bond issue. The large excess of Gov
ernment expenditures over receipts was adding
money in circulation, while the New York
banks are now losing weekly to the Sub-
Treasury. During last September the receipts
from Europe at New York, according to the
Custom-house report, were 111.738.242. This
month .there have been no receipts of gold and
none are likely before the end of the month.
Last September the Treasury not only offered
to anticipate October 1 Interest on the 4 per
cents of 1307 as It has done this year, but also
â  offered to anticipate the redemption of over
$14 000.000 of Pacific currency Cs. Neither offer
was taken advantage of on any large Fcale
by holders of bonds. National banks were in
creasing their circulation last September on a
larger scale than this. These differences in
I the circumstances last year must be taken into
account in connection with the quick recupera
tion of New York banks last September. The
loan contract last year between September and
October 1 reached nearly $80,000,000.
The bond market has moved generally in
sympathy with* stocks, but has not been as
active nor changes as wide. United States 2s

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23.â Financier says:
The Clearing-house banks of New York City
were able last week, throuch the familiar
operation of contracting loans and lessening de
posit liabilities, to strengthen their position,
surplus reserves having risen to nearly $3,000.
--000, as against about $250,000 for the week pre
vious. This was accomplished in the face of an
actual loss of $2,500,000 in cash, an amount
rather less than the known operations of the
week had prepared the street to expect. The
wholesale liquidation which has been In evi
dence for some days past is reflected in a con
traction of $17,866,500 in loans and a coincident
reduction of 120.798.000 In deposits.
The shrinkage in the latter item, lowering
as it did the reserve liability by 25 per cent,
released over $5,000,000 in cash and explains
why With money still flowing into the Treas
ury 'and to the West, the banks are able to end
the week in a stronger position from a cash
standpoint than they began it. In the past
three weeks the decrease in loans had been
no less than thirty-one millions, while deposits
have been reduced over fifty millions. In the
same time there has been a loss In cash of
nineteen million. The latter item explains the
drift of banking operations very well, for it
Is known that the loss of specie and legals to
the interior has not been as heavy as the fig
ures given above indicate. The money has
flown In large part into the Treasury, and I^,
has been this constant drain that has neces
sitated the policy of liquidation to maintain
As bearing on this point the completed totals
of the New York national banks as given in
their official statements of September 7 show
that between June 30 and the first week in
September country bank balances here were re
duced only four millions, whereas the con
traction in other deposits were about seventy
four millions. in the time intervening between
the two official statements the national banks
lost $21,000,000 in specie and le?als. The move
ment to the Interior since September has been
a little more active, but nothing in comparison
to the loss in cash sustained by the banks this
month.
Exports and Imports.
NEW YORK, Sept.'- 23.â The exports of gold
and silver from this port to all countries for
this week aggregated $365,210 silver bars and
coin and $5000 gold, a total of $870,210.
The Imports of specie this week were $193,
--858 fold and $79,190 silver. The Imports of dry
poods and merchandise at the portr of New
York for the week were valued at $10,033,517.
Cash in the Treasury.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 23.â T0-day's state
ment of thÂ» condition of the treasury shows:
Available cash balance, $286,454,261; gold re
serve, $255,625,636.
London Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. 23.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram, says:
The tone of the market here to-day wa*

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Sept. 23.â Wheat showed ' heavi
ness at the start. Yesterday's sharp advance
here was followed by an advance of only %@^c
at Liverpool, while other foreign markets did
not show any greater Improvement. Buying
consequently on the failure of the most promi- j
nent bear house Thursday had apparently |
ceased, and although the market for a short
time exhibited some nervousness over the ru
mors of further failures, the reports Involved
only small firms, and the market was soon,
left to the Influence, of normal conditions. A '
tendency to realize on purchases made earlier
In the week gradually developed, and though
the pressure did not become heavy at any
time it was sufficient to gradually force
prices downward. The price finally got well
under put figures and buying against those
privileges caused a Vie reaction. Before the
close, however, the market had again dropped
back into dullness and prices slowly declined
to their former level. Almost nothing was done
In September. There was no demand for that
option and a few selling orders were suffi
cient to cause a decline of me. Primary re
ceipts were heavy and the cash demand poor,
which Increased the heaviness of the specula
tive market. December opened Vio lower at j
72%i??72%c. It declined to 72%0 and closed at j
72%@724e.
Corn was firm for September, but -weak for
deferred futures and dull for everything. De- j
cember closed Ho lower.
Oats were quiet and rather easy. December
4c low^r. .
Provisions were dull, but steady, pork lead
ing Early there was a tendency toward lower
prices but the sharp advance of meats at Liv
erpool' and some covering by outside sellers
sent them higher. At the close January pork
was 2%65c higher. October lard showed 10c j
advance. January lard closed unchanged and j
ribs 24Â®Ec higher.

IiONDOX, Sept. There was a good at
,l tendance at to-day's session of the wool auc
i tion sale-,. The offerings numbered 12,000 bales,
1 principally scoured merinos. Yorkshire was the
' best buyer, with the Continent also a liberal
purchaser. Russia secured suitable parcels of
. merino. A lot of Geelong and Taemanian flocks
â  wens taken principally by home trade. Cross
bredÂ» were in much smaller supply than usual.
) The high . level of prices continued to rule,
though coarser scoured slips were irregular.
' Fine greaslts showed a hardening: tendency and
I good scoured were dear. American representa
i tives were paper bidders for good scoured and
: took a fair quantity at fair prices. Sixty thou
' stand bales were sold during the week. Next
i week's offerings will amount to 76,700 bales.

The circular of George Morrow & Co. says:
"Offerings of all kinds of Barley have been
quite free during the week, and the market,
until yesterday, was decidedly against sellers.
Exporters apparently have all the Barley- they
desire, and their ld<"Â»Â« as to values are consid
erably below those of holders. Chevai.er Is not
In demand at all. In fact. It Is hard work to
pet shippers to even look at samples' of Cheva
lier. Of course, the question of available ton
nage again enters largely as a factor in the
Barley market. Europe wants our heavy bright
common Barley, but shippers cannot accomo
date them for lack of ships."

silks of all descriptions have ad-
vanced to such a point that the raise
in price of ribbons is inevitable;
we therefore determined some time
ago to get a better grade for our
first quality satin and gros grain
ribbon; while having to pay a little
more we will at the same time get
a better quality; our new Hale's
"good goods" brand of ribbon has
more silk In it and of finer quality
than anything we have ever carried;
it is on sale to-morrow, and we think
you will agree with us that It is the
best quality ribbon manufactured;

ots of small things to be done, a boat
oad of wood had to bo brought off irom
vleiggs -wharf, the anchor h.-id to be hove
ihort, the sails loose-nod from their
straps, and it was quite: a time before
:â â  wore ready. At last Captain Jordan
md another pilot made their appear
ir.ee, the anchor chain came through
he hawse with a rush and a rattle as
last as four stout men and a patent
vinch could bring it; up went the jib and
oresail -and the America swung gently
nit Into the tideway. Then it was all
sands to the mainsail halyards, haul aft
he main sheet; and our tour days' cruise
vus fairly started.
First let mo say a word about our gal
ant craft; the America; and in doing so
may promise that she is only typical
)J the whole service. There are lour
>oats in all; the other threefbeing the
3onitaf,JGracie|S and Lady Mine. They
ire all nearly equal in size, of admittedly
qual speed and sea-going capacities.
iOQked at. from the wharf as she lies at
inchor, the America shows singularly
;raceful lines. She has the ideal yaeht
!ke, high-sheered bow, for which Amcri
an shipbuilders are famous. As she is
igged for cruising her spars are not of
ixceptional length, hut they tap.-r up
v;ir(i with a jaunty rako which promises
peed: For her size she spreads a consid
â rable area of canvas; her main boom
.lone i 3 lifty-eight feet in length) and the
ithor spars in proportion. The America
neasures nearly 75 â  tons, and is hi feet
or.X, 2-i feet beam and 10 feet deep.
She was built at Benicia some ten years
igo, but shows no signs of service; look
nÂ» to-day, after a recent overhaul, al
nost as if fhe had Just come off the
tocks. indeed, a boat of this class, never
laving been strained by carrying heavy
:argocs to and fro escapes much of the
ribulaUon which falls to the lot of the
irdinary merchantman, and if properly
sept up will last for many years. The
horoughness of her construction may be
Udged from the fact that she cost 518.5't0,
in enormous sum for such a small raft.
For ballast she carries .sixty-live tons
if lead, built into her bottom, a quantity
iufliclcnt to stiffen her and give her
veatherly Qualities.
There; are few vessels she meets which
an outreach her in a race to windward,
vhlle as to speed, her captain confidently
ieclares that her record is thirteen knots.
â 'ew yachts can beat this.
Below, the America Is fitted up with .-ill.
he comforts of a passenger steamer. The
nain saloon, Borne twenty feet long, has
vide- sleeping berths for half a dozen :
allots, while as many 'more can, at a
jinch, be accommodated on tho settees. '.
n the forward cabin, where the crew is
serthed, there is room for more passcn
;ers. There the cook and steward, rolled
nto one. presides over a businesslike
ooklnfj stove and turns out r.uuls which
vould do credit to any city restaurant.
Our patrol, which was to last at least
our days, began as soon â as we had
>eaten out against a stiff westerly breeze
hrough the Golden Gate. "We took up our
.tatioii just half way between tho light
hip and the entrance to tho bay. and there
,ye dawdled up and down all through the
ong afternoon, waiting for a ship which
night perchance have escaped tho vigi
ance of the Bonita on the outer station.
But ships did not come, or at least they
lid not get pant the watchful Bonita out

another race of men who came from the

southerners, the story ran, had delved In
the sides of the huge peak and had car

These Â«txar.eers, the Navajo story tellers
averred, had niitda great trails over the
valley and even to the apex of the moun
tains, but many ona before they had
iruddenly ceased their visits and the trail
bed been covered up by the sands of the
plain and the detritus of the mountain.
These stories interested a few, who sought
to trace the trail from historic Interest,
while a few others made desultory efforts
to prospect thÂ» gulches of the peak. For
jrears. however, both classes met oniy
failure In their work.
Finally the story of the lost trail waa
forgotten by all except Judge Uolbrook
â¢f the District Court of that section; for

the Navajo and Ute Indians; Creacontlo

because mocking laughter always greeted
their references to the legend.
Prospctors found rich "float" about
tha gigantic bane of the mountain, but no
â¢ne was able to trace the vein or veins
from which It came; and it was once
â¢.greed that this float had been borne an
unknown distance by the passing of the

A company of St. Louis and . . liisvlll*
capitalists became interested In Sierra
Bianco about two years ago and sent a
-fn: '-'r-f t# th* mountain. He made Mb
war. after E\:rmouniins many difficulties,
to the very top of the peak, far above the
line of eternal snows. There he found a
fine outcropping of porphyrltlc quartz. A
eerlea of claims was at once staked out,
and work on a tunnel shaft was soon
afterward begun. This mina Is 14,400 feet
above sea level, and is the highest In the
Un!t?d States. Another mining company,
which had been working at a lower level,
also above the timber line, likewise struck
pay rock. . ."'
News of these strikes was bruited about
last winter despite the efforts to keep
them from the general public, and even
before the snow was off -the lower levels
tnd out of the rulches In the spring pros
pectors bejja.ii to gather at Alamoea and
other places on the railroad from which
teams could be taken to the great moun
tain. The first of the3e were dressed like
farmers, and pretended to be such. In
search of ranches In the San Luis Valley.
When they hired conveyances it was os
tensibly to drive to a ranch near the town.
Then came the filing of the first claims
for locations at the. county sea . and then
the secret was out. . A grand rush was
made from Alamosa, Hopper and other
towns along the Denver and Klo Grande,
reinforced by miners who were no longer
"looking fur ranches. " Thua hundreds of
stt.kea were driven nil over the vast
western and northern sides of the moun
tain. â 
One of the mest . energetic bands of
prospectors In pushing their way up a
gulch hitherto unexplored were surprised
to find a email section of a well defined
trail, showing that nome one had been
there before them) Pressint onward they
found stall more sections of tin's trail, and
at several placea they discovered that it
was a buaic-n- path seven ' feet In width.
Most of it had been covered up by de
composed granite, and bowlders washed
from higher points on the mountain by
meltii-.g snows or by heavy rains, but
enough was left to show that it was a
roaJ over which hundreds of men and
animals must have passed;
Word of this was soon borno to Ala-
Tiosa. Judge Holbruok and the few others
who had held llrmiy to the theory that
:iie Aztecs or their predecessors in power
in Mexico had had great gold mines on
Sierra Blauca were jubilant . - They onoe
more exploited their views and Investi
gations were set on foot which feem to
have' fully confirmed their views. So
far, however, no one hes been able to
trace tho trail to even the semblance of
i mine.
Crescentio Valdez, who had spent all of
t!s life In and about Guadaloupe, tho old
jet Mexican settlement In Colorado, and
-ad devoted most of his time to prospeet

on one of his exploring: trips he had
found an oblong flab, aimoft burled in

reason of the loneliness of thnlr occupa

writing they have to endure. â 
The day's routine on board â  pilot boat
Is very simple. The crew consists of three
men and a mate,, or a boatkeeper, who

charge of the vessel when required. it
oft*n ha? ;â  that there is a sudden de
mand for pilotH and they all, including:
the captain, have to take ships into port.
Then the boatkeeper assumes control and
Â»teers the boat home, unless he too
should be called upon for duty. In that
case a responsible member of the crew
takes . command and the pllotboat, her
capacities exhausted, seeks her moorings
off Meljjgs wharf.
Frequently tho pilot boats' have been
the means of saving: many lives. The lat
est instance occurred bat a few months
ago. It was the pathetic story of thÂ»
lighthouse keeper's son, sick unto death,
no medical aid nearer than San Fran
cisco and a stormy Eea between. The
only boat on the island was a small skiff
ana Into this the keeper, his wife, his
wife's, sister, the sick boy and another
man crowded. The invalid was laid on a
nmttre&s In th* bottom of the crazy '..raft
while his mother heli l a three-monthÂ»-ola

Now and again from out the moisture
laden d&rkness would come a strange,
shrieking sound, â thing like the noise
made by a Blren. Then the calm waters
of the ocean would be lifted up and a
monster whale would rise close beside our
little schooner. I wondered what would
happen If it rose underneath us. All night
long these United tossed around us, some
times. In their play, lifting their huge
tails high out of the water and bringing
them down with a resounding crash,
which sent cloud* of, luminous spray fly

"Once," said Captain Jordan, **as we

"a whale lifted its tail right over the sldo
of the schooner. Luckily he did not
briny it down en our deck.**
Then ti:s talk drifted naturally into the
subject of sea serpents, but as I wish to
keep within the strictest Knits of truth
I will not repeat the yarns 1 heard. Old
Bill Kelly, the boat-keeper, who was
with Perry In the Constitution, knows an
infinite variety of sea stories, and why
should he not, for few men have had a
wider and more varied experience of th*
sea. Tail and wiry, his lean face tanned
by long exposure, he still stands erect
and alert, In spite of his 74 years. Think
of his career, ye landamen who sleep
comfortably every night In your soft
beds. For sixty-four years, ever since he
was a lad of 10, he has roamed the face
of every ocean. Ten times ho has round
ed the stormy Horn; he has gone whal
ing in the tropical South Pacific and fish
ing in the bitter cold of the Bering Sea.
He lui.'t fought for his country, too, and
receives a well-earned pension from
Uncle Bam. He served on board the tur
ret ship Mcnadnock during the naval at
tacks on the Southern ports, and was
present at Mobile, New Orleans and a
dozen other bloody actions. His luck was
with him, and he came through without
a scratch. A long and trying life, yet to
day he is as hale and vigorous as ever,
and when it comes to reefing the main
sail lays out on the boom and handles
the reef earring with all the agility and
dexterity of the youngest seaman.
Monday morning found us off- the light
ship, having traveled Just twelve miles in
seventeen Hours, and here we lost our
first pilot, for, Just before breakfast, the
Ban Jose, from Panama, came steaming
along at a tremendous rate, as If her
existence depended upon reaching port at
the earliest possible moment. She hardly
cared to pause for a pilot, though Captain
Murphy, breakfastless, leaped into the
yawl and was on board in a few minutes.
"It Is easy enough boarding now," said
Captain Jordan, "though last winter,
when I went on board the San Juan, a
slater ship, it was a different story, it
was blowing a howling northwester and I
had grave doubt* as to whether It would
be possible to make the trip. I appealed
to Kelly. 'I can jdo it, sir/ he replied,
â¢with a pair of sculls.' He went with me
In the boat, handling her himself, and

,On the lJist afternoon of our cruise we

little speck of canvas. "What vessel la
It?" was the first question. "'Will she
take?" the neoond. As she gradually rosa
;;bove th* horizon, every detail of her
rigging was criticized. The first point
ascertained was that she had no sky sail*.

"Valuable canto," observed the cap

plain that If a captain refuses to take a
pilot, no matter how well ho may know
the port, he runs a risk of forfeiting: his
insurance ahould any disaster overtake
the vessel. The underwriters may de
cline to pay, but if a certified pilot is
employed they cannot dispute the claim.
Hovvevor, as luck would have it the
Haydn Brown decided to save half her

f"P"*HE mental collapse of poor Victory
I 'Bateman, which is said to have been
entirely due to her of poor Victory
Bateman, which is said to have been
entirely due to her ill-advised at
j tempt to make herself mistress of a
JL repertoire the extent of which was
far beyond her real capacity, has
aroused a new interest In the question of
brain power and brain endurance.
Ambitious and indefatieably industri
ous. Miss Bateman simply "drove a will
ing horse to death," for she crowded her
brain until Its delicate structure gayÂ«
way entirely under the unaupportable
strain, and her friends were obliged to
place her in an asylum for the insane.
While Miss Bateman was crushed by her
self-assumed mental burden, Miss Mary
Nannary, who is known all over the coast,
has weighted herself far more heavily
; and has experienced no ill effects what
ever. Miss Nannary. however, has with
out doubt one of the most phenomenally
quick end retentive memories possessed
by any member of her particularly ex
acting profession. Notwithstanding the
generally received opinion that theatTlcal
people are. as a rule, particularly blessed
in the matter of memories, It is In reality
by no means a fact, for some of the most
brilliant stars In the dramatic firmament
find it impossible to include more than a
dozen roles in their repertoires, and even
these they are obliged to restudy If any
appreciable length of time Intervenes be
tween the dates of their presentation.
Many of our most brilliantly intellectual
actors and actresses find that after years
of severe study their ability to commit
their lines to memory easily and well be
comes much diminished, sometimes to an
extent which is annoyingly inconvenient,
this being again, of course, the result of
too assiduous application. The case of
Miss Nannary, therefore, is so unusual as
to be almost, if not quite, without a par
allel. While tho Eastern leading lady con
siders herself as wall equipped if she has
a reporters embracing fifty parts, our
clever Western actress is excellently able
to perform a different role nearly every
night in the year, should she so choose,
and do so, too. without having recourse
to restudy. Miss Nannary at the present
time is thoroughly familiar with 220 differ
ent plays, and is letter-perfect In her own
part therein. Her mind seems to be of a
Peculiarly Impressible and retentive qual
ity, for anything that she has one*
learned remains in her mental rrasp from
that time forth. It has been said of this
charming lady that she has a "billion
word brain," and reckoning billions in the
American fashion, she doubtl&M can claim
this distinction.

was fair game, and we made for her as

which Â»ai!ed from Hawaii on the same
day as the Haydn Brown. Both vessels
had mad' tha voyage of, 2100 miles in the
same time, arriving exactly within the
hour. We knew, of, course, that she
would not take a pilot, but at any rate
she was good for half fees. So we sailed
right down upon her; it looked as if there
was going to be a collision, when the
helmsman, with a deft turn, siid tha
echuoner clopo under the vessel's stern.
."Want a pilot?" cried our captain. "No,
no," answered the other skipper, waving
his' hand disapprovingly. .We were not
disappointed, our purpose was nerved,
and the owners of the Mary Dodee had
bf?n made responsible for half pilotage.
The same thing occurred with the Mar
tha Davis, another sugar vessel, and with
two pilots still on board we bore up for
the lightship, expecting- to spend another
night fruitlessly.; dodging to nd fro in
ufarch of fresh arrival^. Bui fortune fa

Instantly, and away. like a hound released

There waa no hurry, no fusa. no excite

Just such an emergency. In a moment the

with all the canvas she could carry the

Where was that elusive will-o'-the-wisp
light we were chasing? Again and again
we burned our torchlight, but got no re

WRa nearly exhausted. At last an an
swering light came Irom over tha waters,
far away between Point Keyed and the
Farailones,
"Hard a-lee!" shouts the skipper. Round
(she spins like a top, and away we go on
a fresh tack.
"I'll catch him this time," exclaimed the
captain. "Can't make out what he's after.
Why doesn't he burn another light?"
With patience, the light came, and it
was evident we were closing on our chase.
"All hands to board ship," and our lit

When we got closer we made out a lstrg*

vessels which the French, stimulated by
a liberal Government subsidy, have re

managed; she kept on running before thÂ«
wind, instead of heaving to, as ehe should

"Blow the fellow, what's he doing?**

The ever ready Bill came to the res

had the slightest idea vvhat "trlbord"

brought v.ith It disappointment. It w*i
the laet day of our cruise, and we had

Captain Jordan had confidently counted
on catching her. Through the fog. wÂ«U

-4 faction in the fact that the man who
spent her money has rang himself on
the side of truth in the Dreyfus cam
paign, but it is a satisfaction that comes
late in life to her. Clemenceau married
her In America. One day. years after

tome more than usually atrocious gal

Buch a fuss. Don't you know that you

Thereupon she left him. The romance

Mme. Dreyfus has been much In the pa
pers, but it is remarkable how little they
have found to say about her. In spite of
the pretensions of certain women Journal
ists she never has given an "Interview."
She has been accused of hardness of char
acter. I do not knew on what grounds.
Her great preoccupationâ apart from the
rehabilitation of her husbandâ has been
that her children should be kept in ignor
ance cf their disgrace. The little girl
rias never doubted. "Papa Is in a far-off

Both children had the habit of Inquiring:
"Where is papa now?" And the sad
mother would gather courage to concoct
pious falsehoods. One day the boy ceased
asking "Where is papa?" It Tras a bitter
day for Mine. Dreyfus.
The victims of the "affaire" are of both
sides. Indeed, the saddest case is that oft
Mme. Henry, the doubly bereaved widow
of Dreyfus' unscrupulous enemy. Sorrow
drove her far from common sens*; her
husband's memory drove her far from 1
truth, and the interested counsels of the
generals drove her to Rennes to make x
painful exhibition of her unhappy state.
Doubtless she imagined that the picture
of those home evenings would impress the
judges and the public. How Henry would

while she sat peacefully beside him. He
spread out the little pieces of paper on

famous bordereau in his hands, ana how
"he put it in his hat so as not to forget
it." Yet with each detail the unhappy
lime. Henry was driving another nail
into the structure of her husband's shame.
The "work" that he brought home to do
around the cheerful lamp was forgery.
The pretended confidence of her husband
that his most famous forgery was only
a "reconstruction of verbal evidence""â if
trueâ would make her an accomplice, for
she never saw the wretched man after his
arrest. The audience blushed with pain
as she went on innocently ruining her

A BOY VIOLINIST WHO
IS INDEED A PRODIGY
OfILY SIX YEARS OLD. BUT FLAYS
LIKE A MASTER AND IS DEVOTED
TO THE MEMORY OF HIS
FATHER.
FROM sire to sonâ from Dlonyp Ro
mandy, the well remembered, to
little Gounod Romandyâ has come
the masterful musician's talent.
Another child prodigy has leaped
into the glare of public attention.
Six-year-old Gounod Romardy is the
latest to arrive.
Three thousand people cheered them
selves hoarse at the Orpheum Theater In
Los Angeles last Friday afternoon when a
tiny child, with face strangely old for one
of his tender \ears, and with hair lone
and silky, altogether an odd and almost
pathetic little figure, stood in the orches
tra conductor's chair and drew from a
violin the music immured in its soul.
Among the many talented Angelenos
whose services had been put at the dis
posal of the programme committee for
this big benefit performance for the re
turning boys of Battery D was tne
youngster. Gounod Romandy. A week ago
the committee received this note from the
child:
"I am Dion Romandy's little son Gou
nod. My papa played at the Orpheum
and if he was alive I know he would play
er the returning soldiers. 1 am only >i
years old, but would like to play for the
soldiers' fund. I will try my best. Will
you be kind enough to let me take part.
"GOUNOD ROMANDY.'
The committee accepted Gounod's pro
posal, and events proved its judgment to
nave been sound.
Little Gounod Romandy is one of the
two sons left by Romandy pere, leader of
the original Hungarian orchestra brought
to this coast by Gustav Walters. If ever
an inheritance came through blood from
father to son, then the love of and mas
tery over music was Dion Romandy'a leg
acy to the boy Gounod,
"When Gounod Romandy was a year old
he showed a passion for music. Then his
father bought a small violin for h:m
Gounod promptly discarded all of his oth
er toys for this new and greatly beloved
one. From that day Romandy Sr. was
teased and begged for "lessons." When
his father would come home Gounod
would beg him for "Just one little lesson,
please." So he had them given to him.
That Is, antll the elder Romandy died.
Little Gounod Romandy has the artist's
temperament. Ha Is dreamy, â ensitlvo

Being a man of resources, however, ha
went hastily to Paris to study the latest

Czar wore during' the festivities in Paris,

comfortable in it.
Nicholas is an unwearied worker. All

Then the Czar wants to shake off all
ares he plays with his children, and It Is
on these occasions that he seems most
happy. /
A firm believer !n popular education is
Nicholas. While he was heir apparent he
once said: "Russia has had a Czar who
was a liberator: it also needs a Czar who
will be an educator," and the people have
not forgotten these words. Of the Czar's
interest in popular education there are
many evidences. Hardly a day passes
that the Russian papers do not contain
articles about new schools, new libraries
and new educational societies.
and poetic. His eyes are deep and are
expressive of that which is far beyond the
years of the ordinary tot of 6. His fea
tures are delicately molded and of sweet
but decidedly pensive cast. He is ex
ceedingly reserved, except in his passion
ate grief over the death of his father,
whose srave at Alhambra he decorates
with fragrant blossoms every Sunday.
With a violin case full of flowers he
makes the weekly pilgrimage to Dion Ro
mandy's grave, and onee â the widow's
eyes nil when this is told Gounod was
missed and could not be found. It was
on a Thursday. After a deal of searching
the distrait mother thought of the grave
where the dead violinist lay. She found
the little fellow, his violin case heaped
with blossoms, lying by the side of the
mound, weeping with all the bitterness
that babes are not presumed to have ca
pacity to feel.
An odd thing is the manner in which the
lad speaks of his father. Invariably he
says ;
"'lf Romandy were here." etc. Always
simply "Romandy." Not father nor papa,
but just "Romandy."
Romandy was not the boy's parent's
real name. The man was born Dionya
Heberling. The story of how his name
came to be changed is a romantic bit In a
romantic history.
He composed, in his early youth, a beau
tiful gavotte for sixteen pieces and dedi
cated it to Elizabeth, Queen of Roumania
(Carmen Sylva). In recognition of his
genius Carmen Sylva honored the com
poser with the title "de Romajidy," and,
according to custom, Dionys Heberling
became Dionys Romandy.
Little Gounod, whose first public ap
pearance was of the spectacular order,
is not to be treated as child prodigies
have been many times by greedy or Inju
dicious parents. The case of little Paloma
Schramm is one of others that have
warned Jlme. Romandy of the unwisdom
shown in forcing an infantile genius.
So Gounod's 'precious gifts are to be
nursed and cherished with great care. Al
ready wealthy patrons of the fine arts in
Los Angeles have come forward and vol
unteered to assist in the boy's musical
education. The sensation created by his
appearance at the big benefit affair will
doubtless " Inspire similar offers. With
these toe widow of Dion Romandy Is as
sured of assistance, and this and time are
all that is needed to develop In -Gounod
Romandy the genius that bo baa in such
extraordinary measure.

Martyred family
sentence

junta
ISABELLO ARTACHO, the last rep
resentative of a martyred family,
has again been sentenced to die the
death of a traitor.
Three years ago the Artachos
numbered fiveâ a father and four sons
â and they constituted one of the
wealthiest, the most influential, and at
the same time happiest, families In all
Luzon. To-day Isabello stands alone,
bereft of all that men hold dear â home,
friends, country â even hope itself", and
to-morrow, unless fate intervenes, as
ehe did once before, he will lie in a
shameful grave, and the story of his
branch of the once powerful Artachos
will have been brought to an end.
Surely, however, no story that has
been ever told was more full of cruelty
and wrong, of foul injustice and un
merited disgrace than this of these
martyred five â this father and his four
brave young sons, who offered up their
all upon the altar of liberty and were
doomed each and all to die ingloriously
at its foot.

other leaders of the insurrection
were banished Isabello Artachu. the
now death-doomed man, and a
younger brother were among their

of 1800,000 from the Spaniards, but he
had counseled its acceptance because
he firmly believed that it should be di
vided among the poorer Filipinos who
had followed the provincial leaders and
lost their all by the means.
The Spaniards never intended to pay
the second installment of this money;
and, in fact, kept none of the many
promises which they had made to gain
the ends which they had so much de

so much for his country, was arrested

It was at Cavite that I became ac
quainted with Artacho, his remarkably
attractive face, refined manner and no
ble bearing attracting my attention
most strongly when I first saw him
amid his filthy prison surroundings. In
tellectually he towered like a giant
above the Spaniards about him and his
demeanor was as serenely dignified as
if he had been a ruling prince instead
of a hopeless prisoner. He was then
under sentence of death and had been
condemned without a trial. A military
tribunal had informed him that owing
to proofs placed before it by the dicta-
tor â Agulnaldo did not then call him
self President â his death had been de
termined upon. At this time I was for
tunate enough to be instrumental in de
feating this special plan of the Filip
ino leader, for at Isabello's suggestion
I represented the condemned man'a
cape to fJeneral Anderson, and either
because of that gentleman's interces
sion or through f^ar of American dis
approbation the d^ath sentence was not
carried ' : it. Artacho, however, was
not released, but was set t<> work In a

As soon as the steamer was ready to

from Cavite and for seven months
nothing was seen or heard of him by
those interested in his welfarp. Shortly
after his enforced departure, however,
word came that h'.s only remaining
brother had been arrested and shot at
Imus by Aguinaldo's orders, the charge
against him being treason.
Several weeks ago Isabello Artacho
reappeared in Manila and claimed the
protection of General Otis, but in vain.
General Otis sent him jo Hongkong
under the redhot hail of fierce and bloody
battle; his voice has acquired its tone of
softly vibrant pathos through being raised
to God in supplication beside dying sol

against each other to drown out the holy
sound of prayer with the hellish sound of
"nurderous human conflict.
He carries the proudly poised head of
a conqueror, for long ago he vanquished
man's greatest enemyâ sejf; and he has
the eyes of a saint. His rather thin,
dark hair crowns a forehead roundly
prominent â his Scotch ancestry has
given him the high cheek bones and
square facial contour of his immediate
forbearsâ but he has a nose that most
surely came down to him from a Roman
patrician. He is dressed in soldier blue,
but there is a black cross instead of gilt
insignia upon his collar, and there is a
broad, black stripe running adown the
outer seam of his trousers instead of a
white or a red or a yellow one. For the
rest he wears a foraging cap and an
overcoat resplendent with silken frogs,
and a pair of shoes as trimly fitting, as
nice of quality, and as glossily blackened

Will he tell me something- of himself?
I ask the question after I have resumed
my seat on the vacillating nail keg and he
has perched himself uncomfortably on the
corner of a small brick platform that
forms the foundation for the inverted
castiron cone which does duty for a stove
on colder days, but I know my answer be
fore he speaks.
There is "really nothing to tell," he
says, except the simple biographical facts
which are already known to all whom
they specially interest. If I care for
themâ very well. He was born in Bos
ton, educated among the English resi
dents of Prince Edward Island; went
into business here in California; awoke
to a sense of his vocation a few years
later and studied for the priesthood over
in Santa Clara; took charge of a parish
and then joined the army.

cally at a wounded soldier stumping by
on crutches and carrying a burden of pain
in "the shape of a bare foot cushioned in,

the passing sufferer he seems to have al
most forgotten me. and he smiles be
nignantly as, recalled to a sense of my
presence, he answers: "No; in truth, I
think that there it really began."
"If you only would let me talk of tha
boys now," he continues, "I could tell
you something really worth while, for the
half has not been said that ought to bo
about their bravery on the field of battle,
and their goodness, which is the best kind
of bravery everywhere. Let me tell you
how nobly they stood the strain of those
dreadful weeks in the trenches; how gal
lantly they fought when the chance came,
and how loyal they were to their country
and each other during all their time of
trial."
Ho will tell me all this over and over.
He never tires of sounding the praises of
"his boys," as he affectionately calls
them: but he will tell me nothing of his
own constant, encouraging and helpful
presence on the firing line, of the tour
wounds which he received there, of the
dreadful days and nights that he spent In
the smallpox and leper hospitals in Ma
nila, nursing the patients, ministering to
them in the extremity of death, laving
them out with his own hands and going
to their graves with them when all others
fled from the poor bodies which they
deemed accursed. 'â â¢â¢ 'â : â :â .'
He will not tell me how all his salary,
except just what he absolutely needed for
personal expenses, has gone to "his boys"

they were well. 1
"I did not believe in the war at first
myself." he Bays, "but later I saw things
differently and now there seems to be no
way but to carry it out to the end. A

believed this?"
The blue-gray eyes flash like sabers in

shakes his head slowly.
"My work there is over," lie says, and
then a soft brightening comes to his face,
as if it were touched with the transfigur

Operators, Stall Doing Duty, Calls Up
Some Thrilling IRemlnilsceeces
of Heroes of the Wire,
Captain George L. Kilmer.
O-f T Boston, the 15th of September,
I the pioneer operators of America
f~â l met to swap stories over the juven-
V, I lie days ( ,f the most wonderful dis-
X ccveiy of the century, the electric
telegraph. Snid one of the Old Guard of
Civil War operators still doing duty at
Western Union headquarters:
"It was a notable gathering at Boston,
and I hope I shall not be taken in a spirit
of rivalry nor boastfulness when I say
that the men of the original Military Tel
egraph Corps were the lions of the occa
sion. Why shouldn't they be? Army
heroes are having their innings i ; . mor<
and let me tell you that the lirst man 1
saw killed at the front, and I got there,
musket in hand, about as soon as the
next one, was an operator doing a .â¢ c
of rush work out of purely voluntary en
thusiasm. The affair took place at York
town, the 4th of May. ISC2. When the
Confederates \ evacuated Yorktown a
bright Ohio boy named D. B. Lathrop and
his comrade of the corps, li. I. Smith,
followed the Federal skirmish line into
the works and dashed for the Confeder
ate telegraph office to test the wlrea
toward Richmond. The wires had be< â¡
cut and were dangling from the pole.
Lathrop gave a leap, landed at the base
of the pole and came down with full
force upon a percussion shell lying half
hidden by some light rubbish. The shell
exploded and was fatal.
"Yes, the war operators were the real
pioneers of the hustling methods that
put dot and uash on the skirmish line
of American progress. The principle
of telegraphy was in its infancy when
the war broke ovu forty years ago. Com
merce was conservative and not at all

There was needed a great war
with its fearful draft upon public pa

develop this wonderful system of ruling
the world's destinies as the genii rule

In moving through the enemy's country
the old wirrs. pn!.-s nnd offices were
looked after lirst. If they had been de
stroyed or damaged, as was often the
case, other means had to be improvised,
and the wits of the operators were equal
to the occasion. Operator Nichols of our
detachment, serving at General Stunner's
headquarters during the Seven Days' bat
tles on the peninsula, found during the
battle of Savage Station that he had but
three feel of spare wire to lay a line
twelve feet from the ground. The main

jusl dark aiii! it was necessary to have
a lantern to do his work. The light made
od target which the enemy shelled
briskly, but Nichols held his perch until
er ordered him down,. This daring
r at that lime was only 18.
â â  Another witty expedient was adopted
l ; Operator Fuller of General Boyle's
command during Morgan's Kentucky raid
Morgan's men captured Fuller's
outfit while he was marching toward
Columbia with Boyle's troops trying to
head off the raiders. Wh.Ti the force
reached Columbia the telegraph office was
found dismantled. General Boyle had
some urgent messages to send to distant
posts asking help for the emergency, and
threatened to shoot Fuller if he didn't get
the wires in working order. To vindicate
his good intentionsâ hie was a civilian em
\ loye- as well as to save his life, the un-
I'.icky operator seised the ground wire in
one hanjd and the main wire in the other,
using the ends as a key. and sent the mes
sage on its way. This was not so. difficult,
but it was necessary to get a return,
which could only be done by reading the
shocks en the wire. This he managed to
do by using the tip of his tongue as a re
ceiver.
"Sometimes more than the ordinary
nerve to be expected in an operator when
near his key was demanded by the emer
gencies of war. as was the case in the
Confederate siege of Knoxville in 1863.
Burnside was shut up in Knoxville by
treet'S . orps of Virginians, while
Grant and Sherman were hammering at
Chattanooga. As soon as Mission Ridge
fell before Grant Sherman sot out
'i \. Knoxville by forced marches.
Meanwhile a message reached Grant
to the effeel thai Burnside could not hold
out against I.( ngstreet longer than De
cember l. Sherman was to make the point
by December - and Grant, army head
quarters ami Washington were all terribly
excited over the crisis. Finally it was
arranged to wire Burnside, through the
four offices nearest Knoxville; to wait for
help until i>â¢ ember i l . It was the dead
of night when the messages came to hand,

through the Tennessee mountains.

and Samuel Short of Tomales, who wffÂ£
temporarily visiting him.
From time Immemorial a large herd of
sealions haVe made a rookery of a partial
ly sheltered reef to the leeward of the
island, and Mr. Johnson has found their
noisy companionship rather pleasant, de
spite their depredations on his fishing
grounds.
Intent on doing the honors of his island
home Mr. Johnson took his guest to a
spot overlooking this reef that he might
watch the unwieldy gambols of the great
sea giants, but to his surprise he saw that
something unusual was taking place, for
the lions were all in a state of great ex
citement, the smaller and weaker ones
making clumsy haste to get from the reef
into the water, and the larger ones fol
lowing them with all the speed compati
ble with their dignity and their duty as
self-appointed protectors of those unable
to protect themselves.
One aloneâ the patriarch of the herdâ an
enormous old fellow who had been the
hero of many battles with his own kind
and other inhabitants of the vast water
own cavalry, under the noted Grlerson, to
the front, giving the column a day's start.
One day it became necessary for Smith to
communicate a warning to Grierson. and
Robinson started out with two orderlieÃ
for escort to overtake the advance guard.
When the party was well outside of the
friendly lines it fell into an ambush and
Robinson received the full contents of a
double-barreled shotgun loaded with slugs
and buckshot in his arms and shoulder,
also his right leg and hip. He was
stripped of his instruments and dispatches
and then sent adrift in the woods. in
spite of his wounds the brave fellow
struggled back to meet Smith's advan
cing: columns and fresh dispatches were
sent forward in time to save Grierson
from danger.
"Even under fire the operator was the
equal of any soldier, and his case was
even more trying, for he was not prepared
to light back. While Banks' army was
evacuating Winchester, pursued by
Stonewall Jackson's troops, the Federal
operator. Frank Drummond, sat at the
key until the last bluecoat was out of
sight. The Confederate yell sounded
nearer and nearer, like the baying of
hounds and from all sides came the rat
tle of musketry. Drummond had se
creted all his dispatch copies on his per
son and was detaching the instrument
from the board to keep it out of the en
emy's hands, when a belated orderly
rushed in with a message for the com
mander of the reserves at Harpers Ferry.
With one hand on the key he managed
to draw out and burn his secreted dis
patches. His horse', standing loose at the
door, began to get nervous and he
dropped the key long enough to tie the
frightened animal and give him an as
suring caress. Going back to the key
Drummond again called Harpers Ferry,
but getting no response he took out the
instrument and dashed it to pieces on the
stone pavement. The Confederates were
then firing down the streets in pursuit of
straggling or belated Federals, and Drum
mond ran the gauntlet of their bullets
only to fall into the hands of Ashby's
Confederate cavalry. A term in a war
prison was the reward this brave fellow
got for sticking to his post.
"From the Confederate side, through
one of our corps men, I have a story
scarcely paralleled in soldierly devo
tion to duty. When the Confederate
army abandoned Little Rock in 1K63
one of the military operators. David O.
Dodd. stayed behind and lived some
time in the Federal lines. He was a lad
of 17. Shortly after things had quieted
down under Federal control young
Dodd left Little Rock, ostensibly to go
to Mississippi, but in a few days he re
turned and lingered a short time in
his old haunts. A second time he passed
out of the lines unrestrained until he
reached the outposts. There the guards
searched his person and discovered BOrne
curious pencil marks in a memorandum
book carried openly in his pocket.
"The boy was detained and examined
at headquarters. The strange marks
proved to be telegraphic dots and
dashes, which, when written out, fur
nished a description of all the new Fed
eral fortifications and the distribution
of the garrison troops around Little
Rock. This information in the hands
of the enemy would be dangerous, and
the boy had forfeited his life in attempt
ing to pass the lines with it. When under
examination Dodd admitted that he had
accomplices, and was offered pardon if
he would betray them. He refused, and
even on the gallows, in spite of the ap
peals of friends and relatives, put the
temptation aside, himself signaling the
kingdom, stood his ground courageously
and watched with expectant curiosity two
sieek and .shining objects swimming rap
idly toward him from the mainland.
The slef-k and shining objects were the
â¢wet heads of two large panthers which
for some unknown reason had elected to

rookery as should have courage to stand

from the twisting, turning, rising, falling,
clawing, beating, biting mass of animal

supreme effort the sealion freed himself

raised himself erect.

Robert Grant holds to his readers
in the "Searchlight Letters," and
the contemplative soul, devoted to study
ing out the reasons of things, finds on the
pages food for thought for many a day.
They are written to those in search of the
ideal, to the modern woman with social
ambitions, to a young man wishing to be
an American and to a political optimist.
and convictions are so courageously and
thoughtfully put that even he who
"agrees to disagree" finds his intentions
wavering. The reader is carried along
uneventfully for a few pages and then
suddenly hauled up with the shock of a
brand new thoughtâ such a clever thought
at times that uncut pages would be wel
come that he might right his mental bal
ance while he reached for the paper cut
ter. "The value of the essay on ihe ideal
in life would be so difficult to explain in
review that a transcription of the epitome
that closes the chapter is the wisest
course:
"The ideal life of to-day is that which
maintains the noblest aims of the aspir
ing past, cherishing unselfishness, purity,
courage, truth, joy, existence, fineness of
sentiment and esthetic beauty; but cher
ishes these in the spirit and for the pur
poses of a broader humanity than the
melting soul has hitherto discerned in the
sunset, the ocean or the starry heavens.
There are among us men and women liv
ing In this spirit of idealism, and they,
O my correspondents! are the first class
passengers." They may be carried in few
coaches.
In the letters to the socially ambitious
woman the fourth is the best and states
the case intimately and directly. It is
something of a defense of the woman who
would be socially effective. "If every
woman," says the author, "were simply
to eat her three meals a day, sleep, be
affectionate to her family, reasonably
charitable and do her daily task the world
would lose much of its vivacity, color and
esthetic interest." The surface element
In society is recognized and dismissed as
unimportant, but one is warned against
the common error of choosing to despise
without understanding the cultivated and
Intelligent society woman who is always
a force In any community. The author's
idea of the socially effective is the woman
who can be "in touch with modern social
tendencies and yet be true to the finest
instincts of aspiring womanhood." How
many will he find to realize his ideal is the
question. But the ideal is irreproachable.
The bustling club woman (the ostenta
tious one, for there are delightful excep
tions) is shown up in all her offensive
variety and many a wholesome dose is
given in a sugar-coated pill. The modern
woman with social ambitions is pictured
a potent factor in advancing civilization,
but she is advised "to hold fast to the old
and everlasting truths of life in her strug
gle toward the stars."
The problem of undoing, rather than do
ing, faces the young man who would be
a true American, and a knotty problem it
is. But the political optimist gets the
best lesson of the four, if he will but heed
it. The revelations of "The Honorable
Peter Sterling" are mild when compared
with the doings of the people in Mr.
Grant's political drama, enacted by twelve
principals and a full-voiced chorus. A
startling paragraph reads thus: "The un

the record of the K. K. K.'sâ better
known, where known at all, as the
Kattpunan, or "Union," society of
tv Philippine Islands.
Tlus organization, horn of tyranny and
fostered by persecution almost unbeliev
able, has earned for Itself In a compara
tively brief time a record so appalling aa
to ike the very fact of its existence a
menace to all who understand the true In
tent of its founding and the insidious and
fatal nature of its workings.
The Katipunan society has been for
years well nigh omnipotent in the Philip
pines as far as the affairs of the low
grade native-born people are concerned.
It has advanced men of the most obscure
origin to places of trust and prominence,
and it has stretched out an inexorable and
bloody hand and, without warning, torn
down the wealthiest and most Influential
personages from their high estate and hu
miliated them to the dust. It has com
mitted murders by the hundredsâ murders
of revenge, murders of policy, and some
times, it has seemed, murders of sheer
wantonness, where human life has been
sacrificed merely to gratify a savage love
01' killing. It has planned butchery so
widespread and so devilish as to make the
simple thought of its possible realization
Bomething to fill the soul with shuddering
horror.
That it has failed to carry out Its
original intentions has been through no
weakening of its purpose, no lessening of
the fierce hatred that has burned in every
heart whose owner has taken its vows and
signed its roll.
Throughout all its career of bloodshed
and violence on* idea has 1 dominated Its
projects and movements, but the "hour
and the man" necessary to the carrying
out of that idea in Its entirety never came.
On a smaller scalo though it has made its
presence keenly felt, for to Its teachings
and machinations is due the attempted
revolution of 189G, and the present insur
rection against the United States Govern
ment..
The K. K. K. has thriven like a poison
ous weed, surrounding itself with a mi

THE SUNDAY CALL.
Since the mutiny of twenty-eight
ytars ago. wlipii the Filipino* eoldiera
made a bold but ineffectual effort to
throw off the yoke of Spanish bondage,
thlÂ« running fight between the rulers
and the ruled has been going on.
That unsuccessful attempt atrebellion was
what is now the Katipunun Society, although
the society had no regular formation until
many years later. The failure of the soldiers'
uprising was due to lack of j*operly concerted
action, and the velue of orirnniza firm hocran gftor
Revenue Stamp.
Filipinos have long been looked upon as the rightful prey of any nationality
enterprising enough to pluck ripe and luscious fruit hanging easily within
roach. The story of the encroachments made upon them, of the injustice they
have endured, of the tyrannous dominion that has been exercised over them, is
too well known among all civilized peoples to here require repetition. The story
of the inception, crystallization, aims, growth and work of the one organization
of the PhillppineÃ that has directed itselfâ blindly and fanatically, be it granted,
but still unselfishly and unswervingly and to the deathâ to what its members con
sider to be the welfare of their race and of their countrymen, has never yet been
truly and fully told.
Ever since Spain took possession of the Philippines and quartered there a hand
ful of Spanish officials to rule over and keep In subjection over 7,500,000 of people,
Â« feeling of sullen unrest and disconten has been rife among those of the natives
that, to be dimly understood
by the nidi who were made to
suffer tortures unspeakable be-
cause of the poor judgment and
blind haate which had impelled
them to foolishly and unavailingly
betray the secrets of their hatred-
burdened h' arts before the hand of
Fate had pointed out the hour of
victory, li is wise to learn and profit
by the helpful examples even of those
who are enemies. Years afterward the
Filipinos were taught by the unronsrious^H
instruction of their foreign rosidf'ntsâ
hated then as now and everâ the power of
numbers bound po Inextricably together that
they can only actâ lndeed, on all Important
matters, are obliged to even seem to thinkâ
as one.
Of this new knowledge they took immediate
and sure advantage, nnd upon this foundation
they built, with hands that have never since
known faltering, the mystery-shrouded Kataas-
taasan Kagalnnggalang Katipunanâ "the Most
Exalted and Honorable Union"â the widely pow-
erful and widely feared "K. K. X.," that has for 1
the past Bix years exerted a subtle but well-nigh
despotic influence in all the island affairs directly re-
lnting to their native population.
Naturally gentle, pood-tempered and non-executive, the

â¢who were able to think a little more
deeply and earnestly than their fellows,
ard to realize the conditions of the past
and the possible and probable conditions
of the future, as well as those surround
ing them amid the fleeting moments of the
present.
This feeling has, of course, had its cen
ter in Luzon, for more than half the en
tire population of the Philippines is lo
cated on this one island, and here the
cruelty and rapacity of the Spanish Gov
ernment has had widest and fullest ex
emplification.
The present-day native of the Philip
pines is a child of tyranny and oppression.
It is contended by some who claim to have
made an impartial and exhaustive study
of all the causes leading up to his present
anomalous and decidedly unpleasant situ
ation, that when the Spaniards first took
the governing reins in hand they tried
in good faith, and most earnestly, to make
Europeans out of the then^miable but
obstinately conservative Malaysians, and
failed most signally in the attempt.
The most zealous efforts of the unwel
come new-comers could not metamor
phose a Filipino into a Spaniard. Euro
pean ideas, manners and customs ap
pealed to his simple understanding neither
as being pleasing nor utilitarian. Matters
In general looked quite discouraging
enough to him when viewed from his own
natural point of observation, and he did
not care to take chances as to how a re
moval to another planeâ even though it
should be a higher and broader one
might affect his now rather circumscribed
powers of vision.
Failing in these alleged efforts to bet
ter the condition of the islanders, the
Spaniards evidently decided to confine
themselves to the more pleasing task of
bettering their own. and they proceeded
to do so by preying continuously and
heartlessly upon all such unfortunate
natives as fell into their power.
They taxed the natives in every possible
way, "and often succeeded in securing, for
trivial reasons, the confiscation of lands
which were afterward made over to them,
the unhappy owners in such cases fre
quently being compelled to work their
stolen acres for the emolument of those
who had robbed them of their own. For
their wrongfully acquired farms these
aliens were accustomed to require almost
prohibitive rentals, and when crops failed,
as they too frequently do even in the
Philippines, the cattle and water buf
faloesâthe chief dependence of the lower
class Filipino for labor and foodâ were
seized, and families thus left in abject
poverty.
Under these circumstances the spirit of
revolt grew strong in every Filipino
breast the owner of which was not either
a dotard or a craven. Where a crust
forms over hidden and ever-increasing
fires that crust must sooner or later in
evitably break and expose to the world
the raging hell beneath.
The mutiny which took place on tho
evening of the 20th of January, 187J, In
Proprietary J'tamp.
Cavlte was such a rending and the breach
then made never healed.
On that evening the native soldiers sta
tioned near this place revolted, without
having previously given any understood
sign of discontent or rebellion, and mas
sacred their officersâ the men whom they
had followed, looked up to and obeyed un
til that momentâ as deliberately, uncon
cernedly and mercilessly as if they had
been vagrant curs. No European who
was in or near Cavite during that night
of horror when murder, cold-blooded and
long-meditated, held dominion over the
erstwhile peaceful town, can ever forget
â while memory endures, a single dragging
moment of these awful hours.
It had been arranged among the na
tives that a simultaneous outbreak
should take place at Manila, but through
some misunderstanding or some act that
precipitated the climax the men at Ca
vite took the initiative with results most
disastrous to the cause they had bo close
at heart.
For one night they seemed to be mas
ters of the situation, but the next morn
ing the Spaniards, aroused for once out
of their usual state of arrogant indiffer
ence and haughty unconcern by the po
tentialities of this most unexpected and
surprising obstacle In the smooth and
somewhat sluggish current of their offi
cial existence, mustered force sufficient
to quell the Insurrection and restore at
least a semblance of security to their
own positions. The failure of the move
ment so long planned and hoped for
plunged the Filipinos into worse difficul
ties than they had before even dreamed
of. In Spanish eyes after that disas
trous fiasco every native was a mutineer
at heart, and no man of Filipino birth
was so humble or so Insignificant as to
escape the blighting breath of suspicion.

high aims. Its existence was brief and
Its end sudden and decided, though by no

together for the common good, there

patriot at heart, was afterward shot by
the Spaniards, and for five years longer
the Filipinos waited for th< lr leaders to
find for them some outlet for the fierce
passions which smoldered night and <iay
under their calm exteriors. Meanwhile
the possibilities and desirabilities of well
managed secret I were becoming

mysteries of sign;-- and symbols and cere
monies and passwords, and the binding
power of oaths.

their opportunity. They would form a
great order, composed entirely of the low
er classes of the Islands, cemented into
one vast brotherhood. There is no coun
try in the world, be it known, where the
"common people," as they are called,
could not dominate and rule everything,
from hovel to palace, if they would hut
band together and stay together In spite
of threats or penalties or bribes. They
outnumber the rich and the powerful and
the highly educated everywhere; but
whatever advantage in numerical strength
they possess is moro than neutralized, as
;i general thing, by their lack of adher
ence to each other and to the principles
involved in any movement which they in
augurate.
This difficulty the Filipino leaders de
termined to overcome by the simple expe
dient of making the penalty for even the
slightest defection so severe as to render
the culprit incapable of doing further
harm, while his fate should be a grue

as needed a reminder as to their duties
and obligations in the premises.
Oaths taken in the presence of stern
browed men, any one of whom is not only
ready but in honor bound to avenge
their breaking by a swife, silent and dead
ly dagger thrust, are not likely to be
lightly considered.. A society in which
every man is not only the guardian of his
own vows but is guardian also of the
vows taken by every one of his fellow
members, is not apt to be a weak or eas
ily dispersed organization.
80 it was that the Kataasiaasan Kaga
langgalang Katipunan rose "out of the
depths," as it wen-, in the your 1893. The
dominant spirit in the association at that
time WU Andres Bonifacio, an intelligent
Filipino who had almost unlimited influ
ence with just that class of his country
men who were considered to be most eli
gible for membership. He labored un~
ceasingly to popularize the idea and
through his Individual efforts thousands
of Filipinos were admitted to all the de
grees of the order. To attract the r.ativc3
and encourage them he represented to his
supporters that the movement, though for
certain reasons confined as to Us active
members to those in the humbler ranks of
island life, had the hearty indorsement of
all the wealthy merchants of Manila, and
that vast stores of arms and ammunition
were being provided for the use of the
"revolutionists," as they then styled
themselves, whenever the moment came
that Buch use should promise to be efiect
ual.
Many of those who joined the K. K. K.
in those first days did so impelled by
purely patriotic motives. They saw in its
hidden but far-reaching influence the one
and only hope for future Filipino indepen
dence and prosperity, but this noble senti
ment of love for and loyalty to their
country soon became perverted into an
insensate and revengeful hatred of all
foreigners, friendly or unfriendly, of any
nationality, who had for any reason dared
to intrude upon Philippine shores.
The initial idea was to effect the simul
taneous massacre of all the Spanish
clergy and authorities in the islands, and
thus rid themselves of the presence of
that hated and tyrannous race with one
swift and revengeful stroke, but this Idea
quickly expanded until all sojourning
strangers, however innocent of harm,
were included in this sscretly written
death warrant.

dividual entity, and his almost unlimited
power as a firmly welded part of the
mighty whole which was about to make
him its own. Five of the vows are sub
stantially as follows:
Iâ "I will die slowly, by the most
hideous torture, before I will divulge any
thing that I know, learn or conjecture
about this Very Exalted and Honorable
Union."
II.â "1 will execute at any cost to my
self or others, immediately, unquestion
ingly and exactly, all orders received by
me which are accompanied by 'the Sacred
and Secret Word.' "
III.â "I will cherish active and undying
hatred against all Spaniards and other
foreigners."
IV.â "When the order comes I will
personally assist to slaughter, at once
and without mercy or distinction, all
foreigners within reach of my revenge."
V.â "l will keep these oaths while my
life lasts, and should I forget or disobey
them In the least part I will expect and
most rightfully suffer the most horrible
death which my associates can devise for
and inflict upon me."
To more deeply brand up >n the brain of
the initiate the bloody purpose of the
Katipunan. and the murderous meaning
of the oaths which he had taken, there
was always on these occasions displayed
befbn bis eyes a part of their parapher
nalia consisting of a painted represcnta
tioi on a white screen or cut-tain, through
which were thrust two bare brown arms,
the hanci of one grasping by the hair a
typical European head, while the other
struck at its neck with a bloody dagger.
The motto was "Death to Foreigners,"
and the ghastly symbol expressed this,
and expressed also that all death-blows
were to be struck from behind the
sheltering veil of an all-enshrouding
secrecy.
The official banner of the society is com
posed of three broad lengthwise stripes,
one red, one white and one black; nearest
the top is a royal crown heavily em
broidered with lustrous white silk; below
this are the initials K. K. X.; next a
conventionalized picture of a flaming sun
renting just half-way above the horizon;
and beneath this again is a grisly skull
and cross-bones. The crown typifies the
height of power. The sun, peculiarly
placed as it is, can be looked upon as
either rising or setting, and symbolizes
both the end of foreign interference and
the beginning of Filipino independence.
The skull and cross-bones means death
wherever the hideous trinity appears.
AaiLis against a most strictly enforced.
law in the Philippines for any one to
carry firearms without having obtained
special permission, every member of the
Katipunan provided himself, or was pro
vided with, a bolo, or native dagger, an
ugly implement of heavy steel, not very
sharp except at the point, but a very ef
fective weapon when it comes to stab
bing and slashing at close quarters, as
both Spnnlards and Americans have found
to their cost. Equipped with this death
(ieaiing instrument the low-grade Fili
pino feels that he is a mutch for any
enemy who is brave enough to meet and
arp'.ie with him face to l'aco, or whom he
is fortunate enough to come upon sud
denly and in the darkness.
A special feature of the initiations was
the ceremony of adopting the new mem
ber into "Blood Brotherhood." A knife
of peculiar shape, with many cabalastic
figures carved on the handle, was used in
the simple surgical operation which left
the "mark of the order" on some portion
of the new-comer's body at the same time
that it made possible the blood transfu
sion, or rather commingling, which made
the "brotherhood" something never after
to be disputed or denied. The signing of
the membership roll with a mark made by
his own blood and the receiving of the
"sacred and secret word" which always
thereafter gave authenticity to any or
der received, completed the rite of ad- 1
mittance to the first degree and made the,
candidate a full-fledged member of the K.
K. K. at the same time that it, figurative
ly speaking, burned all his bridges behind
him. It must be all advance and no re
troat with him thereafter, for the signing
of the roster was the signing of his own
death warrant should the fact of his mem
bership become known to the Spanish of
llclals, who spared no effort to extermi
nate all connected with this hated so
ciety.
So complete was the necessary system
of secrecy pursued by the K. K. X.'s that
the members of one band did not know
the whereabouts of another. Even the
names of the heads of the order were un
known to those beneath them. The meet
ings were changed from place to place,
and orders came in secret from unknown
sources and were carried out blindly and
to the letter, even' though obedience
meant death to him who received the
mysterious iind inexplicable command.
The growth of the organization was
absolutely phenomenal, for, in spite of
the unceasing vigilance of the Spanish au
thorities, over 80,000 men joined it during
the llrst two years of Its existence, and In
1896 its membership had Increased to
nearly 50,000.
[Attempts were made by means of spies
Government pasted in regard
to the affairs of the Katipunan, but all
such efforts failed most disappointingly
to achieve anything of real importance.
Thp natives became aware that they were
under the inimical espionage of pretended
friends and gave them and their employ
ers a few bloody but salutary proofs of
their disinclination to submit quietly ta
treachery in any form.
It behooved every man who waa in
cluded in their "Blood Brotherhood" not
only to be scrupulously loyal to hl3 breth-
Iren in dped and word and life, but to
"appearance of
avoid even t^^RSiultibl
evil" lest a shadow of suspicion should
fall upon him and deepen into the dark
ness of death before _. he realized his
danger. . .
The principal government spy was a
man named Aguede del Rosario. He had
been very actively instrumental In the ar
rest of a number of the Katipunan mem
bers, although his part of the work had
beer done so secretly that it was some lit
tle time before bis identity became
known. As soon as his guilt was made
certain, information was purposely con
veyed to him regarding a new meeting
place of the order, and, anxious to dis
tinguish himself Ftill further in the eyes
of the officials for whom he was working,
the ill-fated man walked unsuspectingly
into the trap prepared for him. No hint
of his fate ever reached the world out
side the doors that closed behind him on
that fatal night. Whether he was stabbed
or strangled or slowly tortured into
eternity, no member of the Katipunan
who was not at that meeting ever cared
to ask, and no member who was there
ever cared to tell. It was sufficient for
them all to know that he had gone be
hind the curtain of Silence and thence
forward was powerless to harm them.
The persecutions which the K. K. X.'s
endured were not calculated to make
them love their foreign rulers more or
make them less barbarous and savage in
their own revengeful acts. They were
phot, garroted, confined in underground
dungeons which could be flooded at the
will of their jailers, tortured or starved
to death, according to the fancy of their
captors; but still, like an untamed wild
beast, they fought wildly, desperately and

dying, they might carry with them even
one of the enemies whose living presence
made the world seem accursed.
In 1896 they reached the zenith, of their
power, although their leaders did not then
realize that fact. Had they struck then
their blow for which they had been so
long preparing the whole wor!d would
have stood aghast at the horrid spectacle
of unsparing butchery. But they hesi
tated too long and thus lost the oppor
tunity that to them was golden.
Many arrests were made in the begin
ning of that fateful year, and on the Ist
of July, at Caloocan, occurred the first
open conflict between the K. K. X.'s and
the Spanish military forces. The
Spaniards triumphed easily for the
natives were armed only with bolos and
bamboo spears. The prisoners taken by
the soldiers were confined in the citadel
of Saint Pago, where fifty-nine were suf
focated in a single night because of the
crowded condition of the dungeons, and
the vice president of the society, who
was captured in Canadaba. was bound be
tween two beards and dipped under water
until death released him from his agony,
in the vain attempt to extort from him a
confession as to the plans of the Katipu
nnn.
It was during this rebellion that Agu
inaldo first came into prominence. He
was sub-governor of Cavite Viejo and
learning that he was to be arrested on
suspicion of knowing more than he should
bout the native union aroused not only
i'is own village but San Francisco de
lalabon, Naic. Xoveleta. Imus and Silang
-> dispute Spanish power. All the officers
f the Civil Guard and all the priests in
rhis district were ruthlessly massacred at
this time, and Aguinaldo assumed the
leadership of the entire rebellion, making
his headquarters at Imus.
The great mistake which Aguinaldo
made, however, was in alienating from
himself a large majority of the native
population by ordering Bonifacio, the
founder of the Katipunan, shot at Naic
soon after he himself came into authority.
It was claimed by Aguinaldo's friends
that he disapproved of Bonifacio's blood-
thirsty methods, but the natives believed
that lie feared him as a rival. However
this may be it is certain that after his
death of the K. K. X.'s lost heart and
power. The tremendous coup d'etat which
they had planned could not be accom
plished without his direction and they felt
that the end of all their mighty and
bloody struggle was failure.
It has been thought that the once ter
rible organization was no longer a factor
in Filipino affairsâ that it was only a fear
some memory and not a threatening fact.
The recent capture of one of Its most
cherished banners by an American artil
lery man at Palo a few weeks since
proves the fallacy of this idea, even if thÂ«
"flaming sun" of the society did not ap
pear on the seal of the Filipino republic
and on all its insignia and official stamps.
The Kataastaasan Kagalanggalang
Katipunan is alive still and is directing ita
forces now toward the conquering of
Americans, who are, in their estimation,
only a little less to be abhorred than the
Spaniards were.
The problem presented Is: Given peace,
would they settle on their rescued lands,
or would they, by blood and violence, try
to build up a government of their own,
wherein the educated, refined and law
abiding Filipinos would be relegated to a
subservient position, and tyrannny, of a
different, but no less hateful, kind than
clouded those fair islands in the past,
would again hold full sway?

Coleman and party reach the Grecian settlement in safety. Nora BI&ck
begins to make trouble. Coleman dines alone with her and is Vterwara
accused by Coke of having â  to her and been repulsed. A row
ensues which is Interrupted by the interference of the profewor and tne
college students. â t
The professor and students take Coleman's part. Coke sulks and win noi
breakfast with the party. He meets Nora Black and is asked by her 10
ride In her carriage to Athens.
The valuable aggregation of Intelligence and refinement which decor
ated the Interior ot the first carriage did not hesitate over answering this
appeal. In fact, his fellow students had worried among themselves over
Coke, and their desire to see him come out of his troubles in fair condition
was Intensified by the fact that they had lately concentrated much thought
upon him. There was a somewhat comic pretense of speaking so that only
Coke could hear. Their chorus was low sung. "Oh, cheese it. Coke. Let
up on yourself, you blind ass. Wait till you get to Athens and then go
and act like a monkey. All this is no goodâ"
The advice which came from the carriage was all in one direction, ana
there was so much of it that the hum of voices sounded like a wind blow-
Ing through a forest. â  , "â -â --â >â  â â "
Coke spun suddenly and said something to Nora Black. Nora laughed
ratlif r loudly, and then the two turned squarely and the Wainwright party
contemplated what were surely at that time the two most insolent backs
in the world. .
The professor looked as If he might be going to have a tit. Mrs. WRin
wright lifted her eyes toward heaven, and Hinging out her trembling h&nds
cried: "Oh. what an outrage. What an outrage! That minx- â The
consensus of opinion In the first carnage was perfectly expressed by Peter
Tounh-y, who with a deep drawn breath said: "Well, I'm !" Mar
jory had moaned md lowered her head as from a sense of complete per
sonal .shame. Coleman lit his cigar and mounted his horse. "Well, I
suppose there is nothing fbr it but to be off, professor?" His lone was full
of regret, with a sort 01 poetic regret. For a moment the professor looked
at him blankly, and then gradually recovered part of his usual manner.
"Yes," he said sadly, "there is nothing for it but to go on." At a word
from the dragoman", the two impatient drivers spoke gutturally to their
horses and the carriage whirled out of Aria. Coleman. his dragoman and
the groom trotted in the dust from the wheels of the Wainwright car
riage. The correspondent always found his reflective faculties improved
by the constant pounding of a horse on the trot, and he was not sorry to
have now a period for reflection, as well as this artificial stimulant. As
he viewed the game he had in his hand about all the cards that were val
uable. In fact, he considered that the only ace against him was Mrs.
"Wainwright. He had always regarded her as a stupid person, conceal
ing herself behind a mass of trivialities which were all conventional, but
he thou?l.t now that the more stupid .-He was and the more conventional
in her triviality; th? more she approached to being the very ace of trumps
itself. She was just the sort, of a card that would come upon the table
mid the neat play of experts and by some inexplicable arrangement of
circumstances lose a whole game for the wrong man.
After .Mrs. Wainwright he worried over the students. He believed
them to be reasonable enough; In fact, he honored them distinctly in regard
to their powers of reason, but he knew thit people generally hated a row.
It put them off their balance, made them sweat over a lot of pros and
cons, and prevented them from thinking for a time at least only of them
selves. Then they came to resent the principals in a row. Of course the
principal who was thought to be in the wrong was the most resentful,
but Colt-man believed that, after all, people always came to resent the
other principal, or at least be Impatient and suspicious of him. If he was
a correct perÂ«on. why was he in a row at all? The principal who had been
in the right often brought this Impatience and suspicion upon himself, no
doubt, by never letting the matter end, continuing to yawp about their
virtuous suffering, and not allowing people to return to the steady con
templation of their own affairs. As a precautionary measure he decided
to say nothing at all about the late trouble, unless some one addressed
him upon it. Even then he would be serenely laconic. He felt that he
must '.<â¢ popular with the seven students. In the first place, it was nice
that in the presence of Marjory they should like him. and In the second
place lie feared to displease thorn as a body, because he believed that he
had some dignity. Hoodlums are seldom dangerous to other hoodlums,
but if they eaten pomposity alone In the field, pomposity is their prey.
They tear him to mere bloody ribbons, amid heartless shrieks. When
Coleman rjut himself on the same basis with the students, he could cope
with them easily, but he did not want the wild pack after him when Mar
jory could see the chase.- And so he reasoned that his best attitude was
to be one of rather taciturn serenity.
On the hard military road the hoofs of the horses made such clatter
that II was practically impossible tc hold talk between the carriages and
the horsemen without all parties bellowing. The professor however, strove
to overcome the difficulties. He was apparently undergoing a great amia
bility toward Coleman. Frequently he turned with a bright face and point-
Ing to some object in the landscape obviously tried to convey something
entertaining to Coleman's mind. Coleman could see his lips mouth the
Words. He always nodded cheerily in answer and yelled.
The road ultimately became that straight lance-handle which Colemanâ
It seemed as if many years had passedâ had traversed with his dragoman
end the funny little carriers. He was fixing in his mind a possible story
to the Wainwrights about the snake and his first dead Turk. But sud
denly the carriages left this road and began a circuit of the Gulf of Arta.
winding about an endless series of promontories. The journey developed
into an excess of dust whirling from a road, which half-circled the waist
of cape after cape. All dramatics were lost in the rumble of wheels and in
the click of hoofs. They passed a little soldier leading a prisoner by a
string. They passed more frightened peasants, who seemed resolved to
flee down into thÂ« very boots of Greece. And people looked at them with
scowls, envying them their speed. At the little town from which Coleman
embarked at one stage of the upward journey, they found crowds in the
streets. There was no longer any laughter, any confidence, any vim. All
the spirit of the visible Greek nation seemed to have been knocked out of
it in two blows. But still they talked and never ceased talking. Coleman
noticed that the most curious changes had come upon them since his jour
ney to the frontier. They no longer approved of foreigners. They seemed
to blame the travelers for something which had transpired In the past
few days. It was net that they really blamed the travelers for the nation's
calamity: It was simply that their minds were half-stunned by the news
of defeats, and, not thinking for a moment to blame themselves, or even
rot thinking to attribute the defeats to mere numbers and skill, they were
savagely eager to fasten It upon something near enough at hand for the
operation of vengeance. :~-\
Coleman perceived that the dragoman, all hip former plumage gone,
was whining and sniveling as he argued to a dark-browed crowd that was
running beside the cavalcade. The groom, who always had been a mirac
ulously laconic man, was suddenly launched forth garrulously. The drivers
from their high seats palavered like madmen, driving with one hand and
gesturing with the other, explaining evidently their own great Innocence.
Coleman saw that there was trouble, but he only sat more stiffly. in
his saddle. ThÂ« eternal gabble moved him to despise the situation. At
any rate, the travelers would soon be out of this town and on to a more
sensible region. -. â¢ ,
However, he saw the driver of the first carriage suddenly pull up before
a little blackened coffee shop and Inn. The dragoman spurred forward and
began wild expostulation. The second carriage pulled close behind the
other. The crowd, murmuring like a Roman mob in Nero's time, closed
around them.
CHAPTER XXI.
Coleman wished his horse coolly through to the dragoman's side.
"What is itr^ he demanded. The dragoman was broken-voiced. "These
peoples, they say you are Germans, all Germans, and they are angry,"
he walled. I can do nosslngâ nosslng."
"Well, tell these men to drive on," said Coleman, "tell them they must
dlry* on."
"They will not drive on," walled the dragoman still more loudly. "I
can do nosslng. They say here is a place for feed the horse. It Is the cus
tom and they will note drive on."
"Make them drive on."
"They will note." shrieked the 1 agonized servitor.
Coleman looked from the men waving their arms and chattering on the
box-seats to the men of the crowd who also waved their arms and chat
tered. In this throng far to the rear of the fighting armies there did not
seem to be a single man who was not able-bodied, who had not been free
to enlist as a soldier. They were of that scurvy behind-the-rear-guard
which every nation has In degree proportionate to Its worth. The man
hood of Greece had gone to the frontier, leaving at home this rabble of
talkers, most of whom were armed with rifles for mere pretension. Cole
man loathed them to the end of his foul. He thought them a lot of infants
who would like to prove their courage upon eleven Innocent travelers,
nil hut unarmed, and In this fact he was quick to see a great danger to
the Walnwrie-ht party. One could deal with soldiers; soldiers would have
been ashamed to bait helpless people; but this rabble
The fighting blood of the correspondent began to boll and he really
longed for the privilege to run amuck through the multitude. But a look
at the Wainwrights kept him in his senses, The professor had turned
pale as a dead man. He sat very stiff and still while his wife clung to
him. hysterically beseeching him to do something, do something, although
what he was to do she could not have oven imagined.
â¢ â  man took the dilemma by its beard. He dismounted from his horse
into the depths of the crowd and addressed the W^nwrights. "I suppose
we had bettervro into this place and have some coffee while the men feed
their horses. There is no usÂ« In trying to make them go on." His manner
was fairly casual, but they looked at him In glazed horror. "It is the only
thing to do. This crowd is not nearly so bad as they think they are. But
we've got to look as If we felt confident." He himself had no confidence
â¢with this angry buzz In his ears, but he felt certain that the only correct
move was to get everybody as quickly as possible within the shelter of
the inn. It might not be much of a shelter for them, but it was better than
the carriages In the street.
The professor and Mrs. Wainwright seemed to be considering their
carriage as a castle, and they looked as If their terror had made them
physically Incapable of leaving it. Coleman stood waiting. Behind him
the clapper-tongued crowd was moving ominously. Marjory arose and
stepped calmly down to him.
He thrilled to the end of every nerve. It was as if she had said: "I
don't think there is great danger, but if there is great danger, why
â¢ â¢ here I am â¢ â¢ ready â¢ * with you." It conceded everything,
admitted everything. It- was surrender .without a blush and It

A-as only possible in the shadow of the crisis when they did
not know what the next moments might contain for them. As he took
her hand and she stepped past him he whispered swiftly and fiercely in
her ear "I love you." She did not look up, but he felt that in this quick
lncfdont they- had claimed each other, accepted each other with a far
deeper meaning and understanding than could be possible in a mere draw
ing room She laid her hand on his arm, and with the strength of four
men he twisted his horse into the making of furious prancing side steps
toward the door of th<- Inn, clanking side-steps which mowed a wide lane
through the crowd for Marjory, his Marjory. He was as haughty as a now
German lieutenant, and although he hold the fuming horse with only his
left hand he seemed perfectly capable of hurling the animal over a house
withoul calling into service the arm which was devoted to Marjory.
[1 was not an txhibiti' 11 of coolness such as wins applause on the stage

disdain.' a disdain which with the highest arrogance declared itself in
every glance of his eye into the faces about him. "Very good * * attack

Every step of his progress was made a renewed Insult to them. The very
air Was charged with what this lone man was thinking of this threatening
His audacity was invincible. They actually made way for it as quickly
as children cijuld flop from a ghost. The horse dancing with ringing steps,
with his glistening neck arched toward the iron hand at his bit. this power
ful quivering animal was a regular engine of destruction, and they gave
room until Coleman halted him at an exclamation from Marjory. "My
mother and father." But they were coming close behind and Coleman
resumed this contemptuous journey to the door of the inn. The groom,
with his newborn tongue, was clattering there to tbe populace. Coleman

gave him the horse and passed after the Wainwrights into the public room
of the Inn. He was smiling. What simpletons.
A new actor suddenly appeared in the person of the keeper of the inn.
He, too, had a rifle and a prodigious belt of cartridges, but it was plain
at unct thut he hud elected to De a friend of the worried travelers. A
large part of the crowd were thinking it necessary to enter the inn and
dow-wow more. But the Innkeeper stayed at the di.ur with the dragoman
and together they vociferously held back the tide.. The spirit of the mob
had subsided to v more reasonable feeling. They no longer wished to tear
tii.' strangers Umb from limb on ths suspicion that they were Germans.
They now were frnntic to talk as .1 some Inexorable law hail kept them
silent lor ten years and this was the very moment of their release.
Whereas, their simultaneous and interpolating orations had throughout
made noise much like a coal-breaker.
Coleman had led the Wainwrights to a table in a far part of the room.
They took chairs as if he had commanded them. "What an outrage," he
said' jubilantly. "The apes." He was keeping more than half an eye upon
the door, because he knew that the quick coming of the students was im
portant.
Then suddenly the storm broke in wrath. Something had happened in
the street. The jabbering crowd at the door had turned and were hurrying
upon some central tumult. The dragoman screamed to Coleman. Coleman
jumped and grabbed the dragoman. "Tell this man to take them some
where upstairs," he cried, indicating the Wainwrights with a sweep of
his arm. The innkeeper seemed to understand sooner than the dragoman
and he nodded eagerly. The professor was crying: "What is it, .Mr. Ccrte
man? What is it?" An instant later the correspondent was out in the
Street, buffeting toward a scuffle. Of course it was the students. It ap
peared, afterward, that those seven young men, with their feelings much
ruffled, had been making the best of their way toward the door of the
inn, when a large man in the crowd, during a speech which was surely
most offensive, had laid an arresting hand on the shoulder of Peter Toun
ley. Whereupon the excellent Peter Tounley had hit the large man on
the jaw in such a swift and skillful manner that the large man had gone
spinning through a group of his countrymen to the hard earth, where
he lay holding his face together and howling. Instantly, of course, there
had been a riot. It might well be said thut even then the affair could
have ended in a lot of talking, hut in the first place the students did not
talk modern Greek, and in the second place they were now past all thought
of talking. They regarded this affair Berlously as a fight, and now that
they at last were in it. they were in It for every pint of blood in their
bodies. Such a pack of famished wolves had never before been let loosÂ©
upon men armed with Gras rifles.
They all had been expecting the row, and when Peter Tounley had
found it expedient to knock over the man, they had counted It a signal;
their arms immediately began to swing out as if they had been wound up.
It was at this time that Coleman swam brutally through the Greeks and
joined hla countrymen. He was more frightened than any of those nov
ices. When he say Peter Tounley overthrow a dreadful-looking brigand
whose belt was full of knives, and who crashed to the ground amid a clang
of cartridges, he was appalled by the utter simplicity with which the lads
were treating the crisis. It was to them no common scrimmage at
Vashurst, of course, but it flashed through Coleman's mind that they hnd
not the slightest sense of the flze of the ring. He expected every instant
to see the flash of knives or to hear the deafening intonation of a rifle
fired against his ear. It seemed to him miraculous that the tragedy was
so long delayed.
In the meantime he was in tho affair. He jolted one man under the
chin with his elbow In a way that reeled him off from Peter Tounley's
hack; a little person in checked clothes he smote between the eyes; he
received a gun-butt emphatically on the side of tho neck; he felt hands
tearing at him; he kicked the pins out from under three men in rapid
< I!'- -ess-ion. He was always jelling "Try to get tv the inn, boys, try to
get to the inn. Look out. Peter. Take care for his knife, Peter " Sud
denly he whipped a rifle out of the hands of a man and swung it, whist
ling. He had gone stark mad with the others.
The boy Billle. drunk from some blow 3 and bleeding, was already stag
gering toward the inn over the clearage which the wild Coleman made
with the clubbed rifle. The others followed as well as they might while
beating off a discouraged enemy. The remarkable Innkeeper had barred
his windows with strong wood 3hutters. He held the door hy the crack
for tbym, and they stumbled one by one through the portal. Coleman did
not know why they were not all dead, nor did he understand the intrepid
and generous behavior of the Innkeeper, but at any rate he felt that the
fighting was suspended, and he wanted to see Marjory. The innkeeper
w.-ip doing a great pantomime In the middle of the darkened room, point
ing to the outer door and then aiming his rifle at it to explain his inten
tion of defending them at all costs. Some of the students moved to a
billiard table and spread themselves wearily upon it. Others sank down
where they stood. Outside the crowd was beginning to roar. Coleman's
groom crept out from under the little coffee bar and comically saluted his
master. The dragoman was not present. Coleman felt that "he must, see
Marjory, and he made signs to the Innkeeper. The latter understood
quickly, and motioned that Coleman should follow him. They passed to
gether through a dark hall and up a darker stairway, whereafter Coleman
stepped out into a sun-lit room, saying loudly: "Oh, it's all right. It's all
over. Don't worry."
Three wild people were instantly upon him. "Oh, what was It? What
did happen? Is anybody hurt? Oh, tell us, quick!" It seemed at the time
that it was an avalanche of three <?f them, and it was not until later that

CHAPTER XXIII.
From below they could hear the thunder of weapons and fists upon the
door of the inn amid a great clamor of tongues. Sometimes there arose
the argumentative howl of the innkeeper. Above this roar Coleman s
quick words sounded in Marjory's ear. "I've got to go. I've got to go
back' to the boys, butâ l love you."
"Yes, go, go," she whispered hastily. "You should be there, out
come back." . Â
He held her close to him. "But you are mine, remember, he saia
fiercely and sternly. "You are mme â foreverâ as I am yoursâ remember.
Her eyes half closed. She made intensely solemn answer. "Yes." He
released her and was gone.
In the glooming coffee room of the inn he found the students, the drago
man the groom and the innkeeper armed with a motley collection of
weapons w'l'ich ranged from the rifle of the innkeeper to the table leg in
the hands of Peter Tounley. The last named young student of archaeology
was in a position of temporary leadership and holding a great pow-w:ow
with the innkeeper through the medium of piercing outcries by the drago
man Coleman had not vet understood why none of them had been neither
stabbed or shot In the fight in the street, but it seemed to him now that
nff.-iics were leading toward a crisis of tragedy. He thought of the possi
bilities of having the dragoman so to an upper window and harangue
the people, but he saw no chance of success in such a plan. He saw that
the crowd would merely howl at the dragoman while the dragoman
howled at the crowd. He then asked if there was any other exit from
the inn by which they could secretly escape. He learned that the door
into the coffee room was the only door which pierced the four great walls.
All he could then do was to find out fgrom the innkeeper how much of a
siege the place could stand, and to this the innkeeper answered volubly
ana with smiles that this hostelry would easily endure until the mercurial
temper of the crowd had darted off in a new direction, it may be curious
to note here that all of J'eier Tounley'fl Impassioned communication with
the innkeeper had been devoted to an endeavor to learn what in the devil
was the matter with those people, as a man about to be bitten by poison
ous snakes shtuhi, first of ail, furiously insist upon learning their exact
species before deciding upon ether his route if he intended to run away or
bis weapon if be intended to light them. '
The lnnkeep< r was evidently convinced that his house would withstand
the rave of the populace, and lie was such an unaccountably gallant little
chap that Coleman trusted entirely to his worcL His only fear or suspi
cion was an occasional out; as to the purity of the dragoman's translation.
Suddenly there was half a silence on the mob without the door. It is
Inconceivable that it could become altogether silent, but it was as near
to a rational stillness of tongues as it was able. Then there was a loud
knocking by ;â  single list ana a new wolce began t<. spin Greek, a voice
thai was somewhat like the rattle w. pebbles in a tin box. Then a start
ling voice called out in English. "Are you in there, Rufus?"
Answera came from every Knglish speaking person in the room in one
treat outburst. "Yes."
"Well, let us in," called Nora Black. "It's all right. We've got an
officer with us." â â,, Âx , , , , .
"Open the door," said Coleman with speed. The little innkeeper laborl
ously unfastened the groat birÂ£, and when the door finally opened there
appeared on the threshold Nora Black with Coke and an officer of infan
try Nora's little old companion and Nora's dragoman. "We saw your car
riage in th- 1 street," cried the queen- of comic opera as she swept into the
room She was beaming with delight. "What is all the row anyway?
O-o-oh, look at that student's nose. Who hit him? And look at Rufus.
What have you boys been doing?"
Her little Greek officer of infantry had stopped the mob from flowing
into the room Coleman looked toward the door at times with some; anx
iety. Nora, noting it, waved her hand in careless reassurance. "Oh, it's
all right Don't worry about them any more. He is perfectly devoted to
me He would die there on the threshold if I told him it would please me.
Speaks splendid French. I found him limping along the road and gave
him a life. And now do hurry up and tell me exactly what happened?"
They all told what had happened, while Nora and Coke listened agape.
Coke, by the way, had quite floated back to his old position with the stu
dents. It had been easy in the stress of excitement and wonder. Nobody
had any time to think of the excessively remote incidents of the early
morning. All minor interests were lost in the marvel of the present
"Who landed you In the eye, Billie?" asked the awed Coke. "That was
a bad one."
"Oh, I don't know,'" said Billie. "You really couldn't tell who hit you,
you know. It was a football rush. They had guns and knives, but they
didn't use 'em. I don't know why. Jinks! I'm getting pretty stiff. My
face feels as if it were made of tin. Did they give you people a row too?"
"No, only talk. That little officer managed them. Outtalked them, I
suppose. Hear him buzz, now."
The Wainw rights came downstairs. Nora Black went confidently for
ward to meet them. "You've added one more to your list of rescuers,"
she cri j d with her glowing triumphant smile. "Miss Black of the New
York Daylightâ at your service. How in the world do you manage to get
yourselves into such dreadful scrapes? You are the most remarkable
people. You need a guardian. Why. you might have beep killed. How
exciting it must scorn to be regularly of your party." She had shaken cor
dially one of Mrs. Wainwright's hands without that lady indicating assent
to the proceeding, but Mrs. Wainwright had not felt repulsion. In fact,
she had had no emotion springing directly from it. Here again the marvel
of the situation came to deny Mrs. Wainwright the right to resume a state
of mind which had been so painfully interesting to her a few hours earlier.
The professor. Coleman and all the students were talking together.
Coke had addressed Coleman civilly and Coleman had made a civil reply.
Peace was upon them.
Nora slipped her arm lovingly through Marjory's arm. "That Rufus!
Oh. that Rufus." she cried joyously. "I'll give him ?T good scolding as
soon as I see him alone. I might have foreseen that he would get you all
into trouble. The old stupid!"
Marjory did not appear to resent anything. "Oh, I don't think it was
Mr. Ooleman"ti fault at all," shÂ» answered calmly. "I think it was more
the fault of Peter Tounley, poor' boy."
"Well. I'd be glad to believe it, I'd be glad to believe it," said Nora.
"I want Rufus to keep out of that sort of thing, but he is so hot-headed
and foolish." If she had pointed out her proprietary stamp on Coleman's
cheek she could not have conveyed what she wanted with more clearness.
"Oh." saM the impassive Marjory, "I don't think you need have any
doubt as to whose fault it was. if there were any of our boys at fault. Mr.
Coleman was inside when the fighting commenced, and only ran out to
help the boys. He had just brought us safely through the mob, and, far
from being hot-hended and foolish, he was utterly cool In manner, im
pressively cool, I thought. I am glad to be able to reassure you on these
points, for I see that they worry you."
"Yes, they do worry me." said Nora, densely. "They worry me night
and day when he is away from me." â¢ â¢
"Oh," responded Marjory, "I have never thought of Mr. Coleman as a
man that one vnÂ«M worry about much. We consider him very self-re
liant, able to take care of himself under almost any conditions, but, then.
of course we do not know him at all In the way that you know him. I
should think that you would find that he came off rather better than you
expected from most of his difficulties. But then, of course, as I said, you
know him so much better than we do." Her easy indifference wag a tacit

but it was inscrutable. The actress had intended to go careering through
a whole circle of daring illusions to an intimacy with Coleman, but here.
before she had really developed her attack, Marjory, with a few con
ventiona and indifferent sentences, almost expressive of boredom had
made the subject of Coleman impossible. An effect was left upon .\ora',
mind that Marjory had been extremely polite in listening to mUch ner â¢u 3
talk^bout a person d om s e dld not know how it had all been done.
Where was the head of this thing? And where was the tail .< A fog
had mysteriously come upon all her brilliant prospects of seeing Marjory
WaWright suffer, and this fog was the Product of a, kin. of i,, , Kl c with
which she was not familiar. She could not think how to fight it After
being simply dubious throughout a long pause, she in the end -went into a
great rage.- She glared furiously at Marjory, dropped her arm as if it had
burned her and moved down upon Coleman. She must have reflected that
at any rate she could make him wriggle. When she was come near to
him she called out "Rufus!" In her tone was all the old insolent statement
of ownership. Coleman might have been a poodle. She knew how to call
his name In a way that was nothing less than a public scandal On tnU
occasion everybody looked at him and then went silent, as people await
ing the startling denouement of a drama, "Rufus! She was baring- hi 3
shoulder to show the fleur de 11s of the criminal The students gasped.
Coleman's temper was, if one be allowed to speak in that way,
broken loose inside of him. He could hardly breathe; he felt that hs â-â-,
was about to explode Into a thousand fragments. He "mplJ^ s f ar '^ ."u:

Cupid's finished/ product" that spits like a cat. Nora Black had called hira
like a wife and he had answered like a husband. For his cause, his m - M
ner could not possiWy have been worse. He saw the professor stare at
him in surprise and alarm and felt the excitement of the eight students.
These latter were diabolic in the celerity with which they picked ,
meanings. It ( was as plain to them as if Nora Black had said: "He, i 3
my ColÂ°eman "would have given his nose to have been able to recall that
single reverberat ng word But he saw that the scene was spelling down

Nora was sweetly reproachful. "I left my jacket in the carriage, and

Now it is plainly to be seen that no one of the people listening th?ra
had ever heard a man speak thus to a woman who was not his
Whenever they had heard that spirited form of repartee it had comÂ© fr^ra
the lips of a husband. Coleman's rude speech was to their ears a flat an
nouncement of an extraordinary intimacy between Black and th*
correspondent. Any other interpretation would not have occurred to them
It was so palpable that it greatly distressed them with its arrogance a: i
boldness The professor had blushed. The very milkiest word In his mind
at Nora^ia^kVad'w^ni^rfat^battle. It was her Aglncourt. She had
beaten the clever Coleman In a way that had left little of him but raÂ«Â»
However she could have lost it all again if she haa shown her feeling or
elation. At Coleman's rudeness her manner Indicated a mixture of ead
nesss and embarrassment. Her suffering was so plain to the eye that
Peter Tounley was instantly moved. "Can't I ret your jacket for you. MJm
Black?" he asked hastily, and at her gratefulnod he was off at once.
Coleman was resolved to improve nothing. His overthrow seemed to
him to be so complete that he could not in any way mend it without a.
sacrifice of his dearest prides. He turned away from them all and walked
to an isolated corner of the room. He would abide no longer with them.
He had been made an outcast by Nora Black and he Intended to be an
outcast. There Was no sense in attempting to stem* this extraordinary
deluge. It was better to acquiesce. . n *w ,^ v
Then suddenly he was angry at Marjory. He did not exactly see why
he was angry at Marjory, but he was angry at her nevertheless. He
thought of how he could revenge himself upon her. He decided to take
horse with his groom and dragoman and proceed forthwith on thÂ© road,
leaving the jumble as it stood. This would pain Marjory, anyhow, h*
hoped. She would feel it deeply, he hoped.
Acting upon this plan he went to the professor. "Well, of course you
are all right now, professor, and If you don't mind I would like to leave
youâ go on ahead. I've got a considerable pressure of business on my
mind, and I think I should hurry on to Athens, if you don mind.
- The professor did not seem to know what to say. "Of course, If you
wish sorry, I'm sureâ course it is as you pleaseâ but you have been
such a power in our favorâ it seems too bad to lose youâ butâ if you wish
"Oh, yes, I quite insist," said Coleman, calmly. "I quite Insist. Mais
your mind easy on that score, professor. I insist."
"Well, Mr. Coleman." stammered the old man. "Well, It seems a great
pity to lose youâ you have been such a power in our favorâ"
"Oh, you are now only eight hours from the railroad. It is very easy.
You would not need my assistance, even if it were a benefit."
"Butâ" said the professor. â â â :>" â '--)â  rn _
Coleman's dragoman came to him then and said: 'There Is one man
V.ere who says you made to take one rifle in the fight and was break his
head. He was 'say he want sunthing for you was break his head. He
says hurt."
."How much does he want?" asked Coleman impatiently.
"The dragoman wrestled then evidently with a desire to protect this
mine from outside fingers. "Iâ l think two gold piece plenty."
"Take them," said Coleman. It seemed to him preposterous that this
Idiot with a broken head should interpolate upon his tragedy. '.'After
ward you and the groom get the three horses and we will start for Athens
at once."
"For Athens?. At once?" said Marjory's voice in his ear.
CHAPTER XXIV.
"Oh," said Coleman. "I was thinking of starting." â¢
'.'Why?" asked Marjory unconcernedly.
Coleman shot her a quick glance. "I believe my period of usefulness
is quite ended," he said, with just a small betrayal of bitter feeling.
"It is certainly true that you have had a remarkable period of useful
ness to us," said Marjory with a slow smile, "but if it is ended you should
not run away from us."
Coleman looked at her to see what she could mean. From many
women these words would have been equal under the circumstances to a
command to stay, but he felt that none might know what impulses moved
the mind behind that beautiful mask. In his misery he thought to hurt
her into an expression of feeling by a rough speech. "I'm so In love with
Nora Black, you know, that I have to be very careful of myself."
"Oh." said Marjory, "I never thought of that. I should think you
would have to be careful of yourself." She did not seem moved in any
way. Coleman despaired of finding her weak spot. She was adamantine,
this girl. He searched his mind for something to say which would be still
more gross than his last outbreak, but when he felt that he was about to
hit upon it. the professor interrupted with an agitated speech to Marjory.
"You had better go to your mother, my child, and see that you are all
ready to leave here as soon as the carriages come up."
"We have absolutely nothing to make ready," said Marjory, laughing.
"But I'll go and see if mother needs anything before we start that I can
gel for her." She went away without bidding good-by to. Coleman. The
sole maddening impression to him was that his going had not been of suf
ficient Importance to remain longer than a moment upon her mind. At the
same time he decided that he would go, irretrievably go.
Even then the dragoman entered the room. "We will pack everything
upon the horse?"
"Everythingâ yes."
Peter Tounley came afterward. "You are not going to bolt?"
"Yes, I'm off," answered Coleman.' recovering himself for Peter's
benefit. "See you in Athens, probably."
Presently the dragoman announced the readiness of the horses. Cole
man shook hands with the students and the professor amid cries of sur
prise and polite regret. "What? Going, old man? Really? What for?
Oh, wait for us. We're off in a few minutes. Sorry as the devil, old boy,
to see you go." He accepted their protestations with a- somewhat sour
face. He knew perfectly well that they were thinking of his departure as
something that related to Nora Black. At the last he bowed to the ladies
as a collection. Marjory's answering bow was affable; the bow of Mrs.
Wainwright spoke a resentment for something, and ' Nora's bow was
triumphant mockery. As he swung into the saddle an idea struck him
with overwhelming force. The idea was that he was a fool. He was a
colossal imbecile. He touched the spur to his horse and the animal leaped
superbly, making the Greeks hasten for safety in ail directions. He was
off; he could no more return to retract his devious idiocy than he could
make his horse fly to Athens. What was done was done. He could not
mend it. And he felt like a man that had broken his own heart; per
versely, childishly, stupidly broken his own heart.
He was sure that Marjory was lost to him. No man could be degraded
so publicly and resent it so crudely and still retain a Marjory. In his
abasement from his defeat at the hands of Norah Black he had performed
every imaginable blockheadish act and had finally climaxed it all by a de
parture which left the tongue of Nora to speak unmolested into the ear of
Marjory. Nora's victory had been a serious blow to his fortunes, but it
had not been so serious as his own subsequent folly. - He had generously
muddled his own affairs until he could read nothing out of them but de
spair. ' ..
He was in the mood for hatred. He hated many people. Nora Black
was the principal item, but he did not hesitate to detest the professor,
Mrs. Wainwright, Coke and all the students. As for Marjory, he would
revenge himself upon her. She had done nothing that he defined clearly,
but,- at any rate, he would take revenge for it. As much as was possible
he would make her suffer. â¢. He would convince her that he was a tre
mendous and inexorable person. But it came upon his mind that he was
powerless in all ways. If he -hated many people they probably would not
be even interested in his emotion, and as for his revenge upon Marjory
it was beyond his strength. He was but the complaining victim of Nora
Black and himself.
He felt that he would never again see Marjory, and while feeling it
he began to plan his attitude when next they met. He would be very cold
and reserved. .
At Agrinipn he round that there would be no train until the next day
break. The dragoman was excessively annoyed over It but Coleman did
not scold at all. As a matter of fact his heart had given a great joyous
bound. He could not now prevent his being overtaken. They were only a
few leagues away, and while he was waiting for the train they would
easily cover this distance. If anybody expressed surprise at seeing him
he could exhibit the logical reasons.
If there had been a train starting at one* he would have taken It. His
pride would have put up with no subterfuge. If the Walnwrights over
took htm it was because he could not held It. But he was delighted that
he could not help it. There had been an interposition by some specially
beneficent fate. He felt like whistling. Ho spent the early part of the
night in blissful smoke, striding the room which the dragoman had found
for him. His head was full of plans and detached impressive scenes in
which he figured before Marjory. The simple fact that there/ was no train
away from Agrinion until the next daybreak had wrought a stupendous
change in his outlook. He unhesitatingly considered It an omen or a good
future.
He was up before the darkness even contained presage of coming light,
but near the railway station was a little hut where coffee was being served
to several prospective travelers who had come even earlier to the rendez
vous. There was no evidence of the Wainwrights.
Coleman sat In the hut and listened for the rumble of wheels. He was
suddenly, appalled that the Wainwrights were going to miss the train.
Perhaps they had decided against traveling during the night. Perhaps
this thing and perhaps that thing. The morning was very cold. Closely
muffled in his coat he went to the door and stared at where the road was
whitening out of night. At the station stood a little spectral train and the
engine at intervals emitted a long, piercing scream which informed the
echoing land that, in all probability, it was going to start after a time for
the south. The Greeks in the coffee room were, of course, talking.
At last Coleman did hear the sound of hoofs and wheels. The three
carriages swept up in grand procession. â¢ Tho first was laden with students;
in the second was the professor, the Greek officer, Nora Black's old lady
and other persons, all looking marvelously unimportant and shelved. It
was the third carriage at which Coleman stared. At first he thought the
dim light deceived his vision, but in a moment he knew that his first leap
ing conception of the arrangement of the people in this vehicle had been
perfectly â  correct. Nora Black and Mrs. Wainwrieht sat side by side on,
the back seat, while facing them were Coke and Marjory.
. . They looked cold but intimate. â¢
The Oddity of the grouping stupefied Coleman. It was anarchy, naked
and unashamed. He could not Imagine how such changes could have been
consummated in the short time he had been away from them, but he laid
it all. to some startling â  necromancy on the part of Nora Black some
wondrous play which had captured them all because of its surpassing
skill and because they were, in the main, rather gullible people. He-was
wrong. The magic had been wrought by the unaided foolishness of Mrs
Wainwright. As soon as Nora Black had. succeeded in creating an effect
of intimacy and dependence between herself and Coleman, the Drofe^nr
had flatly stated to his wife that the presence of Nora Black in the nartv
in the inn, in the world, was a thing that did not meet his approval in any
way. She should be abolished. As for Coleman, he would not rtpfonrt wlir
He preferred not to talk of him. It made him sad. Coleman at least

A FEW MINTS TOR MAKING
THE BEDROOM BOTH
COMFORTABLE AND -
ARTISTIC.
Conducted
BEDROOMS, particularly a young
P s^ girl's, are usually crowded with
jL-^y useless things. Cheap pictures
cover the walls, photographs
stand on every and anything; gas
fixtures hold a maze of strings and from
them dangle programmes, dance cords,
bottles, any old sort of a souvenir, neck
ties and perhaps an old shoe the "last
Bummer's best fellow" wore. Don't do it.
They catch dirt. If they are positively
necessary for your happiness store them
away In boxes; you can take them out
and moon over them as much as you
choose, but don't litter up your room.
Have a den, put them all in itâ but keep
them out of the room in which you sleep.
Bedrooms should be restful in every de
tail. There you sleep, there you are
when ill and there you study and think.
When noosing the paper remember the
"hospital part." Designs that look like
writhing sea serpents when one has fever,
or like snails and distorted faces, those
that convey action should never be in
a bedroom. Plain paper in light colors
or tinted walls are best for this room.
Then the pictures, imagine obtaining
the sought-for restful look with the "liat
tie of Waterloo" or the "Blowing Up of
the Maine" hanging on the wall, or ' Sim
ply to Thy Cross l Cling," with a stormy
ocean a rock and a woman gracefully
hanging on the cross. Choose something
that does not tell a harrowing story; a
landscape, quiet water scenes, anything
pleasing and comforting. A picture to

TO-DAY, before I begin to answer
the letters which have piled up into
a stack as high and broad and long
as the moral law. I shall pause just
long enough to give you a formula for a
very delightful toilet vinrgar. It is called
ESPRIT DE TOILETTE FRANCAISE.
Dissolve in a flask:
Oil of lemon, one-fifth ounce.
Oil of lavender, one-fifth ounce.
Oil of thyme, one-fifth ounce.
Oil of bergamot, one-fifth ounce.
Oil cf cinnamon, one-tenth ounce.
Rectified spirits of win*-, one quart.
This toilet vinegar will be found to be
particularly excellent in the treatment of
err-Rsy, sallow skins. It should be used
diluted and never just after soap has been
applied.

may be used instead of meat. Fill the
tomato shells and bake fifteen minutes.

Sprinkle with salt, allow to stand a few

MIiNWRVAâ I really do not see why you
were not successful with your cucumber
cream. The proportions you used should
have been all right if properly mixed. You
should melt the spermaceti, while wax
and almond oil together in a porcelain
kettle. When melted remove rrom the

cumber juice and uenzoln, beating quickly
all the while with an eggbeater until the

and make a gravy, adding to the butter
ali 1 11Â«" flour, pepper, salt and one cup of
rich milk. Pour ov< r tomatoes and serve.
TOMATOES. CORN AND ONIONSâ To
one can of tomatoes add half a can of
times every morning. Another exercise
is to stan'i erect, with heels together,
b^nd the body forward and try to touch
the toes with the tips of the fingers, wiia
out bending tln> knees. One easy way to
do this is to raise thÂ«< arms above the
head, interlock the thumbs and then
bring tho hamls down as near the floor
as possible. Eli ctrlc massage is also
good. A lotion that is very strengthening
to the eyes if made by rubbing one ten
spoonful of boradc add in fifteen drops
of spirits of camphor and pouring over
this two-thirds of a cup or hot water.
Stir and strain and use as needed. Ill
health is usually the cause of dull eyes.
I think it an excellent plan to lie down for
an hour in the afternoon, if one can spare
the time. Every muscle in the body
should be relaxed at this time, and If one
can get in a little cat-nap, so much the
better.
TILLIB TAYLORâ Arsenic should
never be taken in any form, unless ad
vlpod by a physician. A very little am
monia and borax added to the shampoo
will rot make the lmir a lighter shade, but
will help keep tho light tints. Too much
ammonia used on the hair is very in
jurious.

Melt the spermaceti, white wax, almond

When these five ingredients are thorough

HOMINY COOKED WITH CREAMâ
The hominy must be boiled and ready for
use. Place in baking dish the quantity
needed, add butter, pepper and salt. Pour
over one cup of cream, sprinkle cracker
crumbs over the top and cook a light
brown.
Pie Crust and fies.
Good pie crust Is not an easy thing to
make. It takes time, patience and not a
little trouble. A very wise and true say-
Ing have the Japanese, "In the prepara
tion of food it is nece3sr.ry that a man
choose good quality and right quantity.
Also that he display his best manner In
Its preparation." It's true of pie crust.
Good butter, thoroughly sifted Hour and
the sweetest of sweet lard are. all neces
sary for its success, and half the battle
1b tho wav they are put together. After
the flour has been sifted, add to it a lit
tle'salt; put In the. lard or butter and mix
with a knife, chopping the lard Into small
bits. When well mixed add th<> ice water
slowly. Put out on marble, divide, sprin
kle with flour and roll nut. Pinch the
first crust to the edges of the pan, moist
ening afterward with a little water.
Either make the criss-cross top crust or
the plain. For pies made out of jam the
criss-cross Is best, making the pie not
quite so rich. Touch the crust aÂ« little
as possible with the hands, and prepare
.In a cool place.
Some take the paste, roll it out and
thickly butter, fold together, roll out anr 1
butter again. This manes a very rich and
flaky crust.
LEMON PlEâ Three lemons, half a cup
of butter, one cup of sugar, six eggs and
grated rind of two lemons. Cream the
butter and sugar, stir In beaten yolks and
grated lemon rind to taste; also ore heap
ing tablespoonfu] of flour. Add lemon
juice, and just before pouring in the
crust the four beaten whites, keeping
two for the top. Pake until quite solid,
then allow to cool. Reat the whiles of the
two eggs, add powdered sii^m r and a lit
tle lemon juice. Pour over top of pie and

tell you just how long you would have to
use It before the results would begin to
show.
PENELOPEâ I do not at all approve of
the treatment you mention. Anything
that stretches the skin is likely to make
it fall back into deeper lines than be
fore. The only rational treatment lor
wrinkles is to invigorate and rebuild the
tissues and this can only he done by mas
sage, together with a good skin food.
SADlEâ filmy asked the same question
as yourself. Please read what I have said
to her. Just pour a little of the warm oil
into your hand and, with the palm, rub
around and around and up. If you keep
it up it will certainly benefit you. Swing
ing Indian clubs, exercise with dumbbells
and deep breathing will also h^lp you.

eyelashes wil make them grow. Bathing
them in warm salt water is also excel

O. N. E. As you have just joined
the ranks of my beauty, students
I would like to say that to have
a skin of unblemished loveliness one must
pay strict attention to the diet, exercisn
regularly in the open air and never for a
â ingle day miss the tepid sponge bath.
Once a week there should be a hot soapy
tub bath, rubbing the body briskly all
over with a good stiff flesh brush. All
these things must be attended to not for
a day but as the habit of a lifetime if
beauty is your object.
N. E. J.â l do not know that the prepa
ration you mention is positively harmful
plenty of su^rar and a little nutmeg. Put

tablnspoonful of flour, the pulp and juice
of the oranges, stirring constantly. Pour
Into the lined pie tin and bake with one

PUMPKIN PlEâ Remove the seeds
from the pumpkin, cut into medium-sized
pieces and steam until tender. When done

many pies as you intend to make and

spoonful of ginger, cinnamon and salt,
three tablespoonxula of cornstarch and
three eggs- When well mixed add some
melted butter. Bake with one crust.
Fish.
ESCALLOPED LOBSTERâ Chop not
vcr.\ line the meat of one large lobster,
place In a baking dish and pour over a
cream sauce made like that for the boiled
fish, (uniting the parsley. Sprinkle the
lop with fine bread crumbs, strew with
bits of butter, and bake in a sl<>w oven.
CODFISH WITH EGGSâ ScaM and
pick to pifCM about half a pound of cod
fish. Place on stove, bring to a boil and
to the complexion, still T always think it
wiser to make one's own cosmetics, and
then there can be no possible doubt on the
subject. By adding a little very finely
powdered carmine to your cold cream you
will have a perfectly safe rouge. An ex
cellent cold i r"am is made from the tol
lowins formula: White wax. half an
ounce; spermaceti , half an ounce; sweet
almond oil. two and a half ounces; rose
water, three-fourths of an ounce; simple
tincture of bÂ»n?.oin, three drops. For a
very <>ily skin there is nothing better than
the' loth >n made by placing in a half pint
bottle one ounce of fresh, uncooked cu
cumber juice, half-filling the bottle w'th
elder-Hi iwpt water and adding two tabla
spoonfulfl of t at; de cologne. After you
have shaker this well add very slowly
half an ounce simple tincture of bpnzoin,

letting it dry on the skin.

is to take off the lid arid light the paste.
A box is warranted to burn an hour and a

water. Whether or not it will explode

Patti's Advice to young Sing
ers.
"I don't believe in coddling myself and
making my throat too tender," said Mme.
Patti to a young American who sought
her advice. "I kept my vocal powers at
their full by extreme care, but you will
notice. If you have been told of my rules
of life, that I've never made myself sen
sitive to slight exposure.
"Of course a great deal of rubbish has
been written about my dread of taJcing:
cold, and I have been informed of the
eccentric means I use to avoid it. It has
been said that I have all my clothing
marked with cabalistic signs, and tha*-. a
variation of a few degrees in tha weather
will cause me to add to or take from my
clothing so and so many ounces of
underwear. I read also in one crazy pa
per that I never pass from a heated
room to the cold air outside, except by
easy stages, and that to go from the con
cert roam to the corridor stairs, then to
the lower hall, the lobby, the vestibule
and finally to pass into the street is an
operation which takes me half an hour,
'acclimatizing' myself as I go!
"All that is rubbish, of courseâ that is.
It is rubbish to say that I took any such
time. I'm careful, as every singer should
be, to avoid sudden and violent changes;
but on the other hand, I would warn y..ii
not' to make yourself too tender, and in
vite cold by the inexperience of slight
exposure.
"Harden >ourself; build up your consti
tution: don't occupy htuted rooms at any
time; live out of doors at least two hours
every day. and walk and drive. That's
my "advice. Then, don't be afraid to
breathe plenty of good fresh air, even if
the weather is cold. The people who go
about with muffled throats, overburdened
with wraps, men singers who turn up tha
collars of their coats at the slightest
breath of fresh air, and women singers
who hide themselves in a mass of carriage
rugs and cover their laces with laces and
woolnes when carriage driving, are the
ones who first begin to cough.
"On the other hand, don't go to ex
tremes and expose yourself in raw, damp
air. especially at nightfall. Be sensible
and preserve a happy medium between
wise caution and foolish coddling.
"I never go out. summer or winter, rid
ing, driving or walking, without a choco
late caramel in my mouth, letting it dis
solve as slowly as possible."

When. fifty years ago.it began to be gen

menced the construction of a sidewheel
tugboat that would be 154 feet long all
maritime New York wondered. Many were
the prophecies, telling of ill luck to come,
that were made concerningthe Goliah.
After the first wild rush for gold had
subsided in this State and people begun to
turn their thoughts to other lines of busi
ness San Francisco began to assume a
certain degree of importance as a port
and shipping interests multiplied In great
rapidity. During the early fifties in New
York Bell & Brown were one of the larg
est firms of shippers in America. They be
gan to turn their thoughts toward San
Francisco and conceived the idea of in
vading the shipping field here. Accord
ingly they purchased the Goliah and made

alterations in the tugboat so that she had
accommodations for a limited number of
passengers.
When the Goliah reached San Francisco
one of the most successful firms was the
Steam Navigation Company, which had
a line of river boats plying between this
city and Sacramento. Brown conceived
the idea of entering Into opposition to the
line, but Bell was not so sanguine of suc
cess.
Racing was often indulged in and
though negroes were not then so Plentiful
in California as they were along the Mis

record that the boilers of the Goliah were
often strained to exploding point. These
races were not altogether devoid of dan
ger either. To win the captains were al

ways willing to take desperate chances
and while good fortune favored them,
many collisions being narrowly averted,
on one occasion they did not escape so
luckily. Fpon the instance in question
the two boats were racing down the river.
Goliah was being hard pressed and was
slowly being passed. The captain of the
other" boat thought ha had a chance to
crowd his rival over and cross his bows,
thereby gaining the lead, a most import
ant advantage In the narrow river.
By this time the two boats had ap
proached so close to each other that a
callision was inevitable, no matter how
hard both captains might try to avert it.
Captain Galloway was in command of the
Goliah. He was an excellent navigator,
brave, cool and collected, and quick to act
In an emergency At once he realized that
his boat would surely be run down, and
ordered full speed astern. This permitted
the other boat to gain somewhat until
she was just abreast of the Goliah, but
still bearing down upon her, It having
been impossible to change the course so
quickly. Then Captain Galloway th<-ew
his helm hard over and the next instant
the two boats crashed together. The re
sult was that a huge paddle-box of the
Goliah acted as a buffer, receiving the full
force of the collision, and the passengers
were saved. The other boat, however, did
not fare so well. Nearly the entire por
tion of her upper works were raked by the
Goliah's paddle-box and she was. Indeed.
a sorry appearing wreck when she finally
reached the city.
In those days stocks were much more
active than now and there were listed
many more securities than are now to
be found on the boards. Stock in the rival
companies was very active indeed and
both were held high. Lloyd Tevis, the
well-known capitalist, whose death oc
curred in this city recently, was a large
shareholder in the Steam Navigation
Company and took an active in 1 >rest in
the affairs of the rival concerns.
Being possessed of capital he purchased
a river boat which he entered into com
petition against the Goliah. This made
the fight a three-cornered one and, of
course, affected the stock. That of Go
liah as well as the Navigation Company
went down with a rush. The owners of
the Goliah were badly hit. They lost heav
ily, got into debt and finally the boat was
libeled.
Her days of usefulness were by no
means ended, however. She passed Into
oth^r hands and was reconverted into a
tugboat. The Goliah was not a great suc
cess in the tugboat business and the new
owners were forced to succumb to the
better business ability Â«of their principal
competitors. Captain Mlllen Griffith and
Captain Goodall.
After the experience as a tugboat In
San Francisco Bay the Gollah was again
made Into a passenger Bteamer. The Go
liah plied along the coast with success,
one of her principal ports being Eureka,
Humboldt County. The vessel was then
commanded by Captain Conne r and the
advent of his arrival in Humboldt Bay
with the Goliah was made the occasion
of a great demonstration, the Goliah then
being the largest steamer that had ever
entered the port. This waf In 1 57 and a
grand ball was given by the citizens on
the decks of the steamer.
During the latter part of the '60's thÂ©
Goliah again entered the tugboat busi
ness 'n San Francisco Bay. She met with
Indifferent success and was finally sent
up to Puget Sound, where she rendered
excellent service for her owners.f\f) Ipdiai? \iJ\)o by Sribal F^fyts : aims : t^e (Jreat saf?oe

he instilled into Dick the tribal pride
that is the chief characteristic of Dirk's
Indian makeup. Ho told him the story
of the Waanoe-Piute conflict fc-r Lake
Tahoe. It is an unwritten page in his
tory.
The Washoes, once strong and
mighty, lived on the shores of Lake Ta
hoe. Other tribes coveted the lands
where fieh and game were so plentiful.
Especially aggressive were the Piutes.
There was an annual conllict. and,
though the Washoe-s always drove the
Piutes back, the mountain sides reaped
an aftermath of skulls: Their last big
conflict .was when Diek-'s grandfather
â was himstlf a lad.
The Piutes, many thousands strong,
can >- aver] the mountains to strive
again for the lake. The Washoes met
them on the hills which slope down to
Idlewild, the Crocker residence. For
days they fought, the Flutes slowiy
driving the Washoes back. Near Rubi
con Point the Washoes had left their
women and children. The Piutes were
certain of victory â the lojig way was
marked by dead and dying Washoes.
But within sight of their families, each
Washoe, with the strength of ten,
turned upon the Piutes.^and inch by
inch they drove them back the blood
stained way.
That was the last concerted attack
of the Ptul The white man wasen
croaching upon their territory, and they
turned their tomahawks toward the
paleface. The Wftshoes remained un
disputed possessors of. the lake. But
their doom had nevertheless been rung.
For some unknown cause they died by
the hundreds.
At the pov.-wow given in honor of
little Dick's return were gathered all
the Washoe*, and they numbered not
fifteen hundred. Dick's grandfather al
lowed him to return to Mr. Bender, but
once a year he brought him to the land
of the Washoes that he might not lose
his tribal instinct?. There. came a day
when the Government gave the hand
ful of the once mighty tribe of Washoes
al reservation on the -Pinenut hills of
Nevada. Dick's grandfather was not
among them. He died as he had lived â
on Lake Tahoa.
The land around the lake was once
staked out so many paces per Indian
family. Dick Bender year after year
has returned to the exact hillslop*
where his ancestors before him lived.
The other Washoes have forfeited their
rights, so by tribal law it ail belong*
to Dick.
The Washoes and Piutes hayÂ« long
since smoked the pipe of peace. Dick
among them. But he has never al
lowed himself to slip into Piute cus
toms. His ears and the ears of hiM
children are pierced according to
Washoe regulations', and In minute da
tail he honors the Washoe customs.
â¦'Dick has. twice been married, both
times to Washoe women. His first wife,
for whom he paid JoO, died not lone
after she came to his heart and wig
wam. A son by this marriage is re
ceiving a musical education at the In
dian, school, at Carlisle, and expects to
finish at Paris next year.
Dick's second wife, Lizzie by nams,
is a '.young woman of sufficient flabby
avoirdupois to make her beautiful la
Indian eyes. Dick confessed to having
paid twenty-rive dollars fur her, but
hastily corrects the impression that so*
is not as valuable as his first wife.
"Indian man," he says, "when hn

That all, no ceremony, then they mar

BAPTISM

THE Second Battalion of the Che-
Bhire (Ireland) Regiment has
I 1 illed upon to endure a
most unprecedented and unpar
alleled "baptism of fire."
A plain narration of the strange and
â ,we-inspiring adventure in which this
body Hers took most unwilling

wildest imaginings of a sensational ro
mancer, for only a mind accustomed to
â¢vo!v-Â» from its own workings tales of
almost unbelievable happenings could
even formulate in fancy what occurred
in reality. It seemed as if the warlike

force detailed for th* Irish autumn
maneuvers, Colonel Curtels, who is in
command of the Cheshires, did every
thing in his power to make the trip as
easy as possible for his men. The
march from Newport to Upper Church
Is a long one, the distance being nearly
twenty-two miles, and the colonel de
termined to get over that part of the
Journey during the cooler h.>urs of the
night. Consequently camp at Newport
was struck at about eight in the even-
Ing and an hour la-ter the regiment
started on its way.
The night was very dark because of
the thick clouds which since sunset
had begun to obscure the heavens, but
it was far cooler than the daytime had
been, and the men marched gayly
along, .â -inning cheerily as they went.
Captain Kellie, tramping at the he?d
of the column, carried a light by which
to see possible obstructions, and thÂ«
men came swinging steadily after him,
followed by the transport horses and
the Maxim gun.
Every one was in the host of spirits
for the autumn maneuvers, although
they moan a deal of hard work, mean
also a deal of Tommy Atkins' own par
ticular kind of jollity, and are looked
forward to as a most agreeable varia
tion in the monotony of barrack ex

thicker and more threatening, there
was no cloud shadowing the hearts of
the merry lads who were rousing the
echoes along the quiet country road
with their stentorian voices, for no
foreboding of 111 had come to them.

Jj y, a new schoolâ a school for pet
dogs. The idea is not to make
professional tricksters of them,
but simply to teach â  them to amuse
their masters and mistresses at home by
doing something requiring more intelli
gence than simply eating, running and
barking, or lying in comfort on a satin,
sofa pillow.
The idea was evolved by the need of the
hour, and the presence of her own little
dogs, which do all sorts of funny little
"stunts" t even -without direct orders, so
used nre&hey to going through their little
tricks. It has become second nature to
them, and they voluntarily go through
with them in their own play together, or
to attract attention to themselves when
they want something to eat.
She has always been foud of pets, hut
was never content until she had taught
each pet little tricks. At the time her
rooms were a little menagerie. There
were two white mice, a squirrel, two little
marmosets or South African monkeys,
a parrot, a canary, a robin," a fox terrier,
a Maltese poodle and a Brazilian terrier,
besides three tame common house mice
which found their way through their own
little doors In the casing of the doorway
when the dogs were not in sight, and fed
on the crumbs left for them, and, if their
mistress was there, running up to her
and eating: out of her hand and running
up her arm to her shoulder.

But few persons have the necessary time
or patience to spend on their dogs.
The first thing the teacher does is to
make a tirm friend of the dog under tui

authority, and then reward him for obe
dience. All dogs expect rewards for ex
traordinary exertion, just like people. A
few lessons are all that is neci 3sary us

tion formed a part of the regiment's
convoy, and every instant of this fear
ful hour of storm-inflicted Buffering,
mental and physical, was haunted by
the soul-chilling dread that the light
ning 1 might strike the carriage and add
a devastating explosion to the other
terrors of this awful season of heaven's
fusillade.
Most fortunately, however, the light
ning failed to search out this menacing
target, the striking of which would
have proved so frightfully disastrous,
and contented Itself with attacking the
soldiers, who for the first time found
themselves face to face with a foe
which they knew not how to even at
tempt to repel.
The Hashes were almost incessant
following each other with such rapidity
.that, for .minutes at a time the whole
scene was illuminated by a broad and
ghastly blue glare that rendered even
the smallest objects distinctly visible
and made the faces of the men stand-
Ing like statues in the ranks, lying un
conscious on the ground or ministering
to the needs of their Injured comrades,
look like the visages of corpses dead
for many days.
The electricity appeared at times to
descend in a veritable flood, surround
ing each Individual with a phosphores
cent glow which made him seem weird
ly translucent, and turned the falling
raindrops into blazing diamonds. The
imagination which conjured up the
scenes of the Inferno never conceived
a spectacle of wilder and more unearth
ly hideousness in its details and sur
roundings than this which the Second
Battalion looked upon with an unwav
ering bravery which has gained them
the admiration of all who admire true
courage.
It is comparatively easy for a man
to seem brave upon the field of battle,
where there is a visible human foe to
conquer or be conquered by; where
It is possible to dodge a shell or a
saber stroke, or lie too flat to be hit
by a. bullet: or where the blood is rais
ed to fever heat in the fierce onward
charge that means victory or defeat.
It requires quite another kind of cour
age to face a mysterious and intangible
foe which you cannot hope either to
repel or escape, and these men stood
their fiery ordeal most nobly. . ;!\';
The lightning played over them as It
wouldâ prankishly picking out its vic
tims here and there â passing over a
score to descend upon the fated one.
Burning this one, paralyzing the leg*
of another, the arms of the next
knocking these unconscious to the
river-like road, stripping the garments
from those and searing their flesh with
its branding touchâ and still the sol
diers gallantly stood their ground,
obeying the commands of their officers
and doing their best to succor their
fallen comrades. When the storm
abated to such a degree that it was
possible to make himself understood,
Colonel Curteis suggested, with a view,
doubtless, to restoring the men's over
strained nerves to something like their
normal condition, that they should go
on with the song which they had been
singing when the tempest broke upon
them, and without hesitation every
man whom the lightning had left un
touched took up the tuneful strain and
continued it until the task of bearing:
the wounded to shelter was accom
plished.
When the storm was over it was
found that twelve of the soldiers had
been seriously and over twenty slightly
wounded in the one-sided engagement.
The two laborer's cottages which were
the only buildings In the vicinity, werÂ»
metamorphosed Into field hospitals for
the time being, and assistance was sent
for to the nearest towns. ;;T>,
The fact that the electricity was dif
fused over so wide an area and divert
ed by the metal of swords and rifles is,
no doubt, what saved from instant
death all those who are now fortunate
â¢nough to bÂ« only injured.
