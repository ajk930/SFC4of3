alor.s the streets when the bark of a

around the lantern of the dome on the

r'-â¢ -'-.-- -hip was in. It needed no sec
q: : ?un: ft needed no other signal;
every one jumped to a realization of
the sia<l news and the cry "She's in',
she.* in!'' ran up and down the streets
until it ended in a cheer that shook the
bniMir.-r-. Every one rushe-i to the
newspaper corners. Every one crowded
around th- 3 bulletin boards, and then
a.- the whistles took up the cry of welc
ome the crowds could restrain them- '
selves no longer.
' â¢"Where is she? Where is she? How
soon will she be in? When will the boys
land?" were heard on every side and
these who had already asked spent
their time in shouting. Taere had never
teen such a shoutins:: Th*re had never
risen from the heart of the city such
a cheer. The weary weeks of waitlnsr:
the .longing for a sight of those who
had gone; the realization that it was all
over and the boys were actually home,
was too much, and men. v.-omen and
children rushed about the streets cry
ing, laughing:, shouting, lending them
selves without restraint to the wild
whirl of enthusiasm that took p<->ss?s
slon of everything and raised its voice
to the skies.
Then white the steam whistles added
their hoarse note to the general turmoil
the people headed for the hills. It was
supposed the transport might come in
at once and every one wanted to be i:
a place cf vantage to se~ it Lights
Sashed fram every window that had a
view of the sea. and the windows of the
Clin" House gleamed out ever the v.-j.ter
ami through the haze even to the boys
â¢wVjo knew the place so well. And as
far out as the heads the roar of thÂ«- city
could be heard as a subdued murmur
struggling out against the wind. It was
partly cheer and partly steam whistle.
but -there was welcome in everyo ne of
its vibrations, and even the west wind
could no: drive it back. Over the city
the roar rose like a pandemonium and
everything seemed to shake with its
power; surely every man in the city
who'- had sound lungs was shouting at
least half of the time, for it was hard
to imagine how the racket could other
wise be made; and when the whistles
finally let go it was not from lack of
â will; It was from a shortage of steam
and from the sheer exhaustion the en
thusiasm had caused.
The first gun na.a nardly boomed from
the Spreckels tower when The Call men
were, on- their way to the wharf. The
tug Alert had been ordered and was in
readiness, and in the growing dusk it
slipped out toward the heads, tuning
Its whistle and driving its engines to
their best. There was nothing in sight
when the tug reached the heads, but
she sped on into the ocean, the foam
leaping aside from her bows and the
spray fiying over her. What if there
had been a mistake! What if after all
some vagrant collier, passing in the
mist over the harbor entrance, had been
mistaken for the soldier-laden vessel
toward .which all thoughts were turned.
A low-lying schooner showed dimly for
a minute through the gathering gloom,
and every heart leaped: but as the tug
drew nearer the outlines of her sails
became apparent and the watchineeyes
sought elsewhere for the transport.
Another schooner played the same trick
and st:Il no transport, but the tug kept
en to the westward.
A blur In the mist; a smudge against
a -sky almost as dark as itself; what
might be a mast cutting the gray back
ground against which it swayed and a
spark like a glowworm grew out of the
sea, and as the tug bounded toward it
It took shape and the transport hove
into view.
It was just inside the bar by the
rine-fathom buoy, riding head toward
home and in sight of the harbor en
trance. It must have been a glorious
eight for the home-comers- The Cliff
House was ablaze â¢with light, but the
fc^ze -softened the glare until it reached
the boys like a glow In the sky. Fires
fciAzed -..â .- the hills behind. Across
The San Francisco Call.
THE TRANSPORTS SIDE SWARMED WITH MEN
when The calls tug drew alongside the soldiers crowded to the rail and shouted questions across the water. They cheered and they swung their arms and waved their .hats and
when they learned -of the magnitude of the reception awaiting them they yelled themselves hoarse. They are wild to be home, and the transport cannot come too soon Cor them.
the channel the lighthouse on Point
Bonita shone like a star, and the. moon
â the real,- old-fashioned wi?stern
moon, rose blood-red and big as a cir
cus rir.g far back over the hills behind
the bay. It was just such a 'sight as
the boys had seen athc-usand times; it
was one of the memories they had car
ried with them all through, and there
was something in it which brought the
tears to eyes used to seeing sights that
call : ng.
From the decks of the Alert came the
first greeting from home. There was
light enough to see the Cars that
waved and there was net wind enough
to drown the cheer that echoed over
the water and came back from the
ship's side. "'Welcome home.'" went
frÂ»m the tug.. "Hurrah: hurrah!" came
back with a promptitude born of long
waiting for a sight of some one to say
â¢â¢home." Then the tug herself joined,
and her whistle roared three times in
riotous greeting. The men en the
transport cheered with a will for an
swer, and then after spitting a barrel
of water from her siren the Sherman
bellowed back three times like some big
ocean monster that was a-weary.
The men were everywhere about her.
There was not space for another along
her rail. There was no room to spare
in her boats. Men were in her rigging
and Leads protruded -from every port

hole. She was alive with men, and
they cheered and chattered and ques
tioned and answered from a thousand
throats at once. For a time there was
no unraveling the tangle of voices; the
men. just talked to the people on the
tug; just called across to them, with
out regard ; as to whether they were
understood so long as they were heard.
\ There were calls friends; there
were eager inquiries for what arrange
ments had been . made for the great
reception, . for' word of it had reached
the men at Nagasaki and Yokohama,
and there " were : demands as to th*
probable time the transport would
enter the harbor. . There were inquiries
as to the capacities of certain well
known restaurants, and from a hun
dred thirsty men at" the bow came vo
ciferous directions that the quantity of
steam beer now on hand be quickly re
plenished.
"How. many are sick?" was the next
question.
"Twenty, but the- will all be able
to go ashore to- morrow."
"Any dead?" was the next question.
with some hesitation, for a transport
seldom arrives here without at 'least
one nftire'to the list of those "who" have
gone before. And It is the same with
the Sherman. There are two men
sleeping ' upon her decks, wrapped -in
the flag for- which '. they fought so -well.

They died of typhoid on their way {
over, almost, it might be said. In sight |
of the home they so longed to see. ;
One is Sergeant Korning of Batter
A c-f the First California Artillery; the j
other is Private Dinsmore of Company 1
B of the First California Infantry.
Kornins died July -â¢ Dinsmore on
August" 2. Then there was a third-
Private Bowman of- Company G â who
died on the transport in Manila Bay.
His body was buried in the Paco Ceme- j
tery. ;
Private Hard of Company E stayed
at Lacolaba Hospital to nurse Private
Pratt of the Hospital Corps, who was
ill with, smallpox. Kurd's act is con- .
sidered a most heroic one. Major, Syrr.Â»
remained at Manila to take a commis
sion In the Thirty-sixth Regimentâ one j
of 'the new ones being formed there. t
The boys regret his absence very much.
Twenty-five men were left in quaran- t
tine at Xegros. ;
These were a few of the Items culled
across from the transport. There was !
more to hear, but as every one along j
the rail spoke at once, it was more" like j
the rattle of the Gatltng than human j
speech. A few of tnn.=e on the brfcLfcÂ° I
managed to report ''all well and wild
to be home."
In the midst of it all the regimental
bandsmen â  left ; their â¢ places -at the- rail,
and. getting their - instruments, ] played ,
a quickstep, and for a moment the
cheering stopped and the band h-*id
sway. It sounded well out on the
water, but there was something more
in it than real music. The march was
not a brilliant one. . but it had in it
more of the heart than the head and
spoke the home longings of the men
who crowded the vessel.
â  The .words papers and news brought
another - wild j yell, and as the Alert
hung* on and. off around the transport
her consort, the William D. came along
side with its load of ALLS.
Then the , Governor Markham came
round the stern of the transport, her
band playing and her whistles roaring.
As she came : alongside "Home, Sweet
Home" " ated out over the water and
to the transport. There was silence and
then a cheer, and after a time another
one, but it was hard for the boys to
cheer with the lump in the throat of
each. Â£^i
A boat put c 2 from the Alert and
some men from The Call were taken
aboard. They had orders to go there
and they were taken to the; sea ladder
In a small boat and left to their fate.
It was slightly out of order, but trans
ports with California troops on board
come not to this shore every day. v Be
yond the fact that all alive were well,
however, - and j that ? death - had j claimed

I that the boys â were home.
The boys would talk of nothing- else
| and they talked of nothing else until
ias th transport turned her searchlight
! upon the Alert they spied a roil of flags
â  upon her deck.
"Give us- those flags," they called.
"All right, pass a line," was the an
swer. And the. flags were hauled up on
: board the transport and they were soon
â¢ waving merrily from over the rail and
; out through the portholes. Feast to
! new 3 from, home the men were most
I anxious to get the Sags. It is evident
\ their love, for it has not -waned in the

The tide had turned while the tug
circled rc-und the transport. The vessel
i pointed westward, but there was no
I fear of her leaving again and besides
J the hour mi late. The story of the
; boys' home coming had not reached the
: city. The people knew only that the

load.

â  Francisco that could be made to produce
I noise was turned loose and the terrific
| din startled the community into a spasr
j modic scramble for the open air, many
I being unable for the moment to realize
: what it was all about. The effect pro
: duced by booming cannon, screeching
i whistles and clanging bells, for the first
| quarter of an hour can hardly be describ
! cd. A riot call sounded through the
! streets would not have produced half thr;
[ hurry and excitement of that brief space
| of time.
It is true the announcement was made
i over a week ago and has been repeated
: daily ever since that the- first news of the
[approach of the Sherman â within sight of
I the shores of California would be signaled
I in just sucn a manner, but the signal
i came with such startling suddenness that
: the people were momentarily dazed and
i did net at first realize what it all meant.
j Those in the vicinity of the newspaper
j offices were- quickly informed by the bul
j leuna that the volunteers in whose honor
â¢ they have prepared a magnificent recep
! ticn were close at hand, and the informa-
I tion was quickly disseminated throughout
! the city.
Th- streetcars, loaded down with the
! usual homeward-bound crowds of work
i ir,g men and women, were naif emptied in
| a trice, the erstwhile passengers swelling
j. the rapidly growing ranks ot pedestrians,
I half, crazed with joy and adding to the
I awful am by venting their enthusiasm
1 through tinhorns, peddiers of which
1 seemeu to literally spring out of the =ide
[ walks.
Upon the first announcement of the ar-
I rival of the transport off the entrance to
1 the harbor the street railway companies
i placarded all their cars with notices to
! that effect and reaped an abundant har
j vest of nickels for their foresight. Every
i body wanted to get downtown and to get
i there in a hurry.
What a. crowd that was and how quickly
: it gathered! Within thirty minutes from
the time The Call cannon boomed forth
â  the welcome tldlr.gs Market street was a
! living stream of humanity, with the water
I front its objective point, while every car
| headed for the ferry was packed with
! men. women and children, all seemingly
imbued with tfee one idea that the Sher
i man with her precious freight was head
' ing straight for the Folsom-street wharf.
> Of course, they were mistaken, but they
! were not taking any chances of not being
f among the first to greet the returned
| heroes when they landed.
i Chief Wharfinger Percy Henderson was
i seated in hia office when he heard the first
! shot fired in the battle of noise. Before
he could get to the door a telephone mes
sage brought the information that the
racket had already conveyed to him. Then
| he looked out along the wharf toward tha
! ferry building, and the sight that met hia
| gaze deprived -him of breath and caused *
sudden pallor to overspread his features.
! The wharf was already black with people.
! and they were charging down upon the
! little wooden building in which the chief
I wharfinger's headquarters are located like
| an avenging army.
"What time does the parade beginT*
"When will the boys land?"
A score of eager voices shouted these
and numerous other questions of a similar
| nature at his devoted head in a' chorus.
After a hurried consultation with the tel
i ephone. while hia assistants held the door
â  against the swarmins crowd. 3ir. Hen
\ derson announced, fearfully, that the sol
! diers would not land to-night and that the
i bay parade would take place at 10 o'clock
I this morning.
At first the crowd was inclined to be
I rather insistent, but they soon realized
that the course decided upon was the only
' sensible one. all things considered, and
stepped aside to make room for the new
j arrivals. For three solid hours Mr. -Hen
' derson and his assistants repeated the
! same answers to the same questions, until
their heads began to droop and their
tongues could hardly wag.
At last it reached this stage:
"Have a cismr. Percy?"
"Ten o'clockâ" thanks."
"Mr. Henderson, I would like toâ"
"Parade beslns at 10â." __ __ â â¢:
Then the Chief Wharfinger fied. His as
sistants held out a while longer, but
hum.-in nature could not stand the strata
and they were forced to capitulate.
â¢ Am - those who besieged the whar
finger's office were many relatives of the
soldiers, and they were naturally much
disappointed when informed that it woald
be impossible for them to greet their

waiting. They thronged around the ferry
building clear out into the middle of East
and were admitted, a few it a
time to gaze In wondering admiration at j
the beautiful effects produced by the col- j
ectric light decorations in the grand |
corridor within. But thpy hung about the i
vicinity In a solid mass for hours, and It
was nearly midnight before a gradual
melting away of the vast throng began j
to be perceptible.
The Impresslveness of the Â«cene along
the harbor front was Intensified by the I
tempest of noise that filled the air. for th.-
Firens and ordinary steam whistles did not
1< r up their hideous racket for an Instant
until about 10:30 o'clock, when the string
electric lamps reaching to the top j
of the tower on the ferry building- sud
denly blazed forth like bo many string* cf ,
huge diamonds. Then thr- noise ceasftd
with a precipitancy that was startHng.
While a chorus of "Ohs" from several I

thousand throats expressed tne aumiiv
tion of the multitude gathered on the
ground below. At the same tim> the
arches of electric lights spanning Mar
ket street were illuminated trÂ«>m the
â¢ front to the City Hall, temporarily
transforming thai thoroughfare into a
grand vista of light.
Uptown the crowd was perhaps less
dense but it was --yen more noisy and
numerous enough to fill the sidewalks on
c street and a goodly por
tion of the roadway. The venders of tin
drove a thriving trade In those
( ar-splltting, discordant mediums ot itn
parting enthusiasm, their customers In
cluding all BOrts of men and women or
_. s and conditions. At tno Intersec
tion of Market and Third streets the
street was impassible during a portion of
the evening, th-- throng extending in one
unbroken mass well up into Kearny
street. Many private illuminations were
alight and caused the mobs of noise
makers to desist momentarily out of pure
admiration, only to resume their racket
with redoubled energy as if to make up
for the time lost. A big mob gathered
outside of the, Phelan building, wnere the
citizens' executive committee has its
headquarters, and when the committee,
head.d by the Mayor, its chairman, at
tempted to enter their carriage for a tour
of inspection of the decorations a big
force of police was necessary to clear a
passage to the curb. But the crowd,
while big, noisy and aggressively demon
strative, was good-natured. Everybody
was happy and hnd no idea or thought of
anything else. When th,, electric lights
along Market street were turned on the
|oy if the multitude was unbounded, and
when some one shouted that the City
Hall was illuminated there was a rush m"
that direction that for awhile threatened

to result seriously for tho weak.
It proved only one of those spasmodic \
acts of a crowd moved by a simultaneous
desire to do the same thing at the same
time and the rush was over almost as
soon'as it began. However, they went out
to see the illumination, and they saw a
sight that well repaid them for their trou
ble although it is extremely doubtful if
there were any In that crowd who thought
of trouble for a moment.
But while the downtown section of the
city appeared to have drained the resident
portion of its population, there were a lew
who remained In the vicinity of theii
homes and gave vent to their Joy and en
thusiasm in ways of their own. ]â¢ ireworks
and bonfires were numerous, and wore not
confined to any particular portion ot the

The beach near the Cliff House was al
most as brilliantly lighted as was Market
Btreet, but in a different way. Ihe news
that the transport hail been sighted com
ing in was telephoned early in the evening
by the executive committee, with orders
to build bonfires at various points along
the beach to let the boys on board tn<
ship know that their relatives and friends
ashore were awn re of their approach and
were preparing a welcome for them. Ihe
orders were carrlefl out to the letter, and
the beacons that wt re soon casting tneir
brilliant glare across the water could be
seen for miles. The Cliff House was light
ed from top to bottom, apd the effect from
the transport must have been grandly
The Golden West band went out on the
Caroline when the news that the transport
had been sighted was first received, hop-
Ing to be the first to ti.kle the ears of
the returning soldiers with welcoming
music. They found that the Sherman was
not coming inside the heads until morn
ing, and after a cruise around the bay re
turned to the city.
During the midst of the shouting and
the cheering the current was sent through
the luWW electric lights that form the
grand Illumination of Market street. I- rom
the ferry to the City Hall night was
turned to day, the street having the ap
pearance of being covered by a canopy <>f
sparkling jewels. The big dome ol trie
City Hall shone out in bold relief, every
outline being brought out by the rows of
incandescent lights. The lights were
turned on for only a few minutrsâ just
long enough to give Mayor Phelan and
the members of the executive and decora
tion committees time to drive along the
line of scintillating brightness. The citl
zens on the street went wild with delight
at the display. To-night the lights will
burn during the entire evening and the
illumination will be repeated to-morrow.
At the California Hotel headquarter-- of
the Native Sons and Daughters ot the
Golden West the grand marshal ana his
assistants wt re busily engaged in arrang
ing th- details of the procession when the
report of the gun from the top of The
Call building gave the first notice that the
Sherman had been sighted, and a few
minutes later confirmatory news was re
ceived. Then there was surprise on the
faÂ« of every one. for all their plans were
not ready, but they soon recovered 'rid
w<Â»nt to work with renewed vigor, work
being kept up until an early hour this
morning.
During the evening the hcadquarter3
were crowded with people of all classes?
anxious to know when the soldiers would
land and when the parade by night would
take place.
COMMITTEE HEARS NEWS,
Notified Major General Shatter Over the
Phone to Monterey.
When It Was Heard That the Transport Would
Stay Outside Bombs Were Sent Up
and Bonfires Lighted.
The executive cimmlttee was too full of
j enthusiasm over the news to attempt to
get down to business for several hours
after it met last night in the offices of
i Mayor Phelan.
Every member was bedecked with
, badges. All daneÂ«Â»d around the rooms
i like a lot of small boys who had been
promised an afternoon at the circus. The
I cheers from the crowds on the streets
were reinforced in less volume, but with
none the less vim by the hurrahs from the
i comrhitteemen. They would make an at
tempt to transact business when an un
usually loud horn or an extra enthusiastic
cheer scattered them and they rushed to
the windows to join in the fun.
Messages from all sections poured in on
i the committee. It seemed that every one
i wanted to know where the transport was,
when she was coming In, If the pro
gramme was going to be carried out, and
a hundred other things that the commit
tee was as anxious to know as the in
terrogators.
Messengers were dispatched for General
Shafter, Captain Long and Captain Bat
childer None of the officers could be
found. Finally General Shafter wa.s locat
ed at Monterey. Mayor Phelan grasped
his 'phone and asked central to get the
general on the other end of the tine with
a rush. While thÂ»- gentlemen anxiously
awaited a reply news was received that a
tug was about to depart for the transport.
"Hold her for a minute until we pre
pare a. message to the boys.' was the
shout. And the tug waited until th'i fol
lowing message was put on board:
'Volonel Duboce, in command of the
First California Regiment, on board trans
port Sherman; Greetings to the first
California, Come in to-morrow. We will
welcome you as soldiers have never been
welcomed before.
"CITIZENS' EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
"JAMES PHELAN, Chairman.
Following close upon the dispatch of
this message came the information that
Commodore Spreckels had left on a tug
for tho transport to present his plans Cor
the naval parade to the commanding of
ficer ll' suggested that the bay demon
stration take place Thursday afternoon
â¢md asked the committee to await his re
turn before announcing a definite pro
gramme to the public.
"Will we wait?" whs th*> chorus. Well,
none of us have any business to go to bed
to-night."
Speculation as to what the commander
of the transport would do in the matter
began to worry the eommitteemen. Gen
eral Shafter had not been heard from, and
a feeling of uneasiness began to make it
self evident. Anything that would Insure
the carrying out of the programme was
the determination of the committee. It
was suggested to appeal by wire to Pres
ident McKinley to order the transport to
wait outside the Golden Gate so that tho
glorious welcome arranged for her pre
cious cargo of soldier boys could be car
ried out.
Colonel Sullivan was dispatched to the
Government wharf in quest of Captain
Long and in search of any bit of infor
mation concerning the transport. The
committee was eager for every morsel of
news. In its eagerness it forgot moment
arily the shouting from the streets and
ignored entirely the business it had be- |
fore ii.
The tingle of the telephone bell set them
wild with excitement. .
"This must bo Shafter," was the shout; \
"now we will know." Â
And sure enough it was. The Mayor
explained to the general that the traus
port had been sighted and that he under
stood she was lying outside the heads
awaiting orders. " He asked the general,
as a special favor, if he would issue
orders for her to remain outside until the
morrow, so that the reception programme
could be carried through to the letter. Ihe
information came back that orders of the
kind asked for had been waiting for the
transport on a pilot boat far outside the
heads for several days, and had certainly
been delivered. These orders were to the
effect that if the transport could not make
port before 4 o'clock in the afternoon Of
the day of her arrival she was to remain
outside until noon the following day.
"I will be with you in the morning,
were the gr-neral's closing words.
When the Mayor repeated the informa
tion to the committee there was a hurrah.
It was proposed to shout the hews to the
crowds on thÂ» streets, and the cheer upon
cheor that greeted the committeemen
gave emphnsis to the fact that all ban
Francisco was satisfied to know that the
boys were in sight of their homes, and
for the moment it appeared that that was
sufficient. .
"The transport is flashing her search
light as though sh<> is lonesome,' was the
next message that the 'phone transmitted
to the committee.
The lonetvomc-ni-ss of the situation was
dissipated in a liffy. The orders went out
post haste to build bonfires all along the
Cliff House beach, and a wagonload of
bombs and rockets was sent out there to
be used in letting the boys of the First
know that they were not going to take
San Francisco unawares.
The first official news from the trans
port to the committee was brought in by
the quarantine boat. The officers notified
the committee that they had headed the
transport off about a mile outside and
that after boarding hor she had put to
sea and would remain about six miles off
shore to await orders.
"We are all right now!" and the com
mitteemen dancrd about and waved their
hands, forgetting for the time that they
were sedate business men.
Then they started to go out on the
streets and shout.
THE CALL'S WELCOME,
Its Representatives First to Greet the
Californians.
Papers and News Eagerly Sought by the Men.
Music and Cheers in Appreciation
for Kindnessesâ Persiflage.
Toot! Toot! Toot!
The loud whistle on the tugboat Alert,
hearing representatives of The Call, sa
luted the returned California boys. Three
rumbling toots from the transport Sher
man answered the salutation, and as the j
tup neared the vessel that held Califor
nia's pride the men lined the rails and
poked their tanned faces out of port holes,
and then there was a resounding cheer.
This was quickly answered by the pas- j
sengers on ihe tug with waving flags, and |
cheery greetings wertfcsoon flying across
the water.
This was the first greeting the volun
teers received from shore, and both sol
diers and newspaper men made the most
of it.
"Got any papers?"
"How is dear old Frisco?"
"What's happening on shore?" etc., etc.
A perfect volley of interrogations were
fired at The Call representatives as their
tug came to a stop close to the Sherman.
The men showed their eagerness for
news of home by their queries and items
of information about their reception and
probable mustering out were received
with satisfaction. When informed that
their parents ami relatives were prepar
ing to give them a breakfast that would
make their heads swim, the. news was re
ceived with a loud huzza, followed by In
teresting questions.
"Are we going to have stew?" anxiously
asked one soldier, and when the answer
came back that none of that delectable
stuff would be given them, another loud
cheer was given.
It was apparent that the boys were not
in favor of stew. Some said it was ladled
out to the regiment in large quantities
during their passage home and became
monotonous.
"You're going to get chicken and cran
berry sauce, with numerous small bot
tles," some one volunteered and the noise
that answered the doltghtful news plainly
told their joy.
The William T). with thousands of cop
[es ol The Call came alongside and bundle,
after bundle of papers were hoisted on
board and were quickly distributed among
the volunteers. The young men on ttv
launch in their hurry to appease the de
mands for papers pelted hundreds through
the portholes ami openings of the trans
port. Six of them were k> \>i. busy throw
ing the papers and the thanks and cheers
which greeted their efforts was consider
ed excellent payment for the labor.
"Hurrah for The Call!" Hundreds of
voices took up the cheer, and as the ship's
searchlight was turned on the. Alert its
representatives waved their flags in token
of the appreciation.
The men showed their anxiety to be on
shore and see the ones they love. Hun
dreds of notes fluttered from the deck of
the transport and found a resting place in
the ocean. They contained messages of
hope and health and were addressed to
fond mothers and sisters. Many of these
little tokens of affection were gathered up
and will be forwarded to the anxious
ones.
An exchange of chaff wiled away the
time while The Call representatives were
gathering news.
"Say, boys, how do you like stew?" was
asked*.
"Aw, stews on de bum," was the an
swer.
"Got any canned 'Eagan' ready for us at
the feed?" one private asked. And when
he was informed that beef would not be
in evidence during the breakfast a yell of
satisfaction was heard.
In honor nf the visit the regimental
band mounted the deck and a lively
quickstep denoted the happiness that per
vaded the troops because of the knowl
edge that they were near home.
A half hour after The Call's tug took up
a position close to the transport the State
tug Governor Markham, with the Gov
ernor and staff and a large, party of
friends, hove in sight. A brass band noti
fied the soldiers of their coming and a
noisy welcome was given the. party. As
the tug circled the transport its band
struck up "A Hot Time" find then swung
into the pathetic strains of "Home, Sweet
Homo." A member of the Signal Corps
vainly tried to deliver a message from the
Governor, but the folds of his flag con-
tlnually wound itself around Its stick and i
he at last gave it up as a bad job.
When the tug had retired other news
paper tugs closed in on the transport in ,
quest of news. The programme of their !
reception, disembarkment, breakfast, etc.,
was given the volunteers and was greeted !
with cheers.
"How soon are we going 1 ashore?*
"Where are we goingâ to the Presidio?"
"How's marching on Market street?" "Is
the City Hall finished?" "Does Chris
Buckley see yet?" and other questions
came over the side. All information about
the condition of -Market street, the dec- ;
orations and general reception were' Ms- \
tened to with det.-p interest.
"Say, you want to keep yer eye peeled i
for the mascot of Battery A," a member j
cf tha.t organization yelled. "He's a ;
monk. We've got him dressed up like a
sergeant and his name is Jocko. Look ;
out for him: he's a warm baby." Other, j
important information was called over j
the side by the men, much of which was j
lost in the cheering and tooting of !
whistles.
The sweet strains of "taps" were car- !
ried over the moonlit waters and many of |
thf men retired to their bunks. A large
number, however, were too excited at
their home-coming and remained on deck j
and gave The < 'all's party a parting cheer \
as It left for the city. Three loud toots i
from the Alert were answered by a like
number from the Sherman, quickly fol
lowed by the screeching notes of its siren.

not without some danger to those having
the task in charge, but the gratification
of those who were hungry for the news of
the day amply repaid for all the trouble
and risk. As soon as the whistles an
nounced that the transport had been
sighted T. S. Cotter of The Call's mailing
force, accompanied by J. Coyle and D. j
Lenihan started 1500 copies to the water
front. These were bundled into Henry
Peterson's little gasoline launch, the
William D, which started for the Golden
Gate at full speed. The boets of the rival
papers were also in the race, but when
the small craff began to plunge into the j
large rollers coming In through the gate j
the others turned back.
Sot so with the William D. for Cotter
directed that the boat be kept up to her
full speed. .Waves dashed all over the
boat but after a while the sea went down
and in a short time the papers were
alongside of tho Sherman. To the con
sternation of all, the launch was placed
right up against the big rolling transport
and the crew of the little boat began to
unload its freight of information. Two
bundles containing 1000 Calls were hoisted
aboard on a line. Then began a scene
seldom witnessed. In some way the
launch had slipped astern of the larger
boat and came directly under one. of the
exhaust water pipes. Tons of water was
poured all over the launch, but the men
did not cease hurling the single copies of
the paper aboard. This was through a
porthole and only a few missed the mark
and fell 'into the ocean. 1
As each paper flipped through the hole
the troopers inside scrambled like mad
for It and as soon as one was captured
the happy possessor retired to learn of
the ik ws'at home. At the conclusion of
this unique delivery an exciting scene
was enacted.
Private Britt. brother of ex-Supervisor
Britt, wanted to send ashore a diary that
he had kept, and he passed the small box
through the port hole. This act attract-

although his voice could not be heard
above the good-naturad din made by the
happy soldiers, he was determined to

the full glare of. the ship's searchlight he
drew his revolver and presented it at

wireless telegraphy. Six weeks

to telegraph ozrr the water, to

a determined point. Receiving
instruments were placed on the

ments began. They zcerc in the
highest degree successful. Mes
sages zcere sent and received a
distance of ten miles out at sea.
In order that there might be no
possibility of failure more sen
sitive instruments ziere secured
and the watch for the Sherman
began. Through the courtesy of
Federal officials transmitting
apparatus was placed on board
the Lightship Xo. ~0. which
was anchored nine miles outside

a great curtain over the i\
ship. From the ocean beach the
guardian ship was no longer
visible, but the watchers at the
Cliff House, alert, keen of car
and sharp f <â  \ sat at their
instrument. Then, shortly after
5 o'clock, the instrument began
to tick. Behind the haze cur
tain of the ocean the man on the .
lightship was sending the \
words, "Sherman in sight."
Time and again the message â 
came from the sea, thrilling '.
tlwse that heard it and spurring ]
them to send it in all haste into â¢
the city. For the first time on â 
the Pacihc Coast and most sue- '.
cess fully in the United States '
The Call had utilized wireless -
telegraphy to herald the home- I
coming of the California Vol- *

And after all the mystery of h
the message from the sea seems ]j
simple. In the sending station j
at the lightship was a Ruhm-
korff coil, which transmitted the }
waves from the electric dxna- "â¢
mos on the lightship. The Morse
characters were made bx the -)
opening and closing of an or- ]
dinar y telegraph key. This ]
charged an aerial wire which *
was suspended eighty-two feet h
tft a vertical direction from the 1
topmast of the lightship. Elec-
trie waves were pulsated 1
through the air and were re- \
ccived through a coherer from a '
similar wire suspended from -
the top of the Cliff House at the -
receiving station. This coherer 1
actuated the Morse relax, which '
in turn zcorked the ink writing -

The boys who had served their country
so well and who are the pride of their
native State w^re peering over the white
sides of the big steamer, shouting first
ar.d then listening with strained ears for
news me or the sound of a fa
miliar voice from the tugs below.
Colonel Duboce, senior military officer
with 1 regiment, walked from a state
onto the deck. The black line
gave way. a voice from the rigging shout
ed "T lone] Duboce." and tnat
officer lifted his cap in response to the
cheers of a thousand men. Colonel Du

responded. ,

voice in the rigging. "It's nothing but
stew three times a day."
" "And not enough of that." rang out a
voice from the bridge.
THREE "PRISONERS."
As soon as The Call's tug got within
' hailing distance Pilot Jordan or. the Sher
man called out that no newspaper repre-
s entatives would be permitted on rsoard.
i Here was a setback for an instant, but
: only for an instant. "We have papers
: and" letters," cried the leader of the expe
i dition. "We'll send a boat." And with
i cut waiting for anything further a boat
was launched and into it jumped Report
ers Fred Healy. William Britt and Louis
Honlg. When they were alongside of the
transport the customs officers called for
them to send up the packages on a line.
It was done in a manner not in accord
! ance with the quarantine regulations or
the officials' expectations. The three men
sprang up and before the astonished offi-
I cers realized what they wÂ»re doing they
had mounted the rope ladder nearly to the
deck.
There a halt was called and the small
boat drew away from the side of the ship
and there was nothing to do but to let the
reporters go on board or throw them over
board A few minutes later they were
safe on deck, and the rope ladder drawn
up which prevented any one else from
getting aboard. However, the reporters
were arrested for violating: the quaran
tine laws, but thi? did not prevent them
from getting the news. From officers and
soldiers they gathered the latest item?
of interest, which will be perused with so
much concern by thousands of the anxious
relatives of the returning soldiers this ;
morning. â â  -â "'-. "-'
The next difficulty encountered was
getting the news to those remaining on
the tug. Again the small boat was called
into service, and under the glare of the
searchlights the rowers pulled to the
great rolling transport. The "imprisoned"
reporters made up their reports item by
Item, and these precious scraps of paper
were heaved overboard. A few fell into
the water, and the difficulty of recover
ing the wet reports was no mean task.
Others were lowered by means of strings,
the soldiers furnishing tin cans, etc., to
keep the paper from getting wet. In the
meantime The Call's- tug was plying
around the ship, much to the concern of
the master of the latter, who seemed to
fear that his vessel might be boarded by
the tug men for the purpose of rescuing
the prisoners. When the last of the news
was handed down, or thrown down, the
dingy pulled away from the Sherman and
The Call's newsgatherers started for the
â¢shore" The tug gave a parting- toot of
the whistle, which was answered by the
transport. accompanied by the wild
screech of the latter's siren, and one hour
later the wet reports were in The Call's
editorial rooms. Â»
STORY OF THE VOYAGE.
In keeping with the regulations of the
"War Department a record of all happen
ings and noteworthy incidents from the
time Colonel Dubocc received word that
the boys from California were to embark
on the Sherman and begin their voyage
home until the anchor was dropped eft
the heads was kept. This report, as
given out by Colonel Duboce, is as fol
lows
On June 8 Colonel Duboce received cable
advices from Manila to the effect that the
First California Volunteers would be re
turned home on the United States trans
port Sherman, and was instructed to have
his command ready for embarkation by
June 20. The regimental headquarters,
with two companies, band and hospital,
were located at Bacolod, the capital of
the island of Negros. and the other com
panies were scattered along the coast
towns and through the interior of the Isl
and, in most cases by single companies,
but in several cases by a half company
and smaller detachments. As soon as the
order could be sent to the many localities
occupied by the troops, all the heavy bag
gage was transported to the coast lines
in accordance with the programme, while
â¦he otHcers and men counted the hours
until the Sherman would arrive. The
transport was delayed somewhat at Ma
nila and Iloilo and arrived at Bacolod on
July 2 with the Sixth United States In
fantry on board, which command relieved
the Californlans.
At this time of the year the monsoons
and typhoons prevail and it was with the
greatest difficulty that the companies of
the Sixth Infantry were debarked at the
several pbinks around the inland, and the
companies <W the Californias embarked.
The coast line â  ( U Is md '" N _ros Is
irregular and of a coral and rocky forma
tion, and in many cases shallow water
necessitated the Sherman lying two or
three miles off the shore, requiring trans
portation by small boats under tow and
sail. It required two weeks' time to em
bark the command, the transport having
to make the complete tour of the island
under many disadvantages in the way of
shallow roadways requiring the detour of
other islands. Several narrow escapes
from what would have been serious ca
lamities occurred, for at times the wind
and rain were severe and vicious For
tunately the regiment finally was boarded
without a casualty, although very few
reached the transport's deck except in a
wet and half-drowned condition, in sev
eral cases some of the detachments being
out in the open twenty-four hours or
longer.
At 3 p. in. on July 16 the trans
port sailed for Iloilo. where, after a stop

The artist is home with his comrades from the land of the common enemy. With the same spirit that
characterized his fighting from the trenches and charges across rice fields in the face of the enemy's fire he
charged the guards on the Sherman and tossed his pictures out on the deck of the waiting Call tug. The guards
tried to head him off and defeat his purpose. They only succeeded in demoralizing his aim and the picture struck
near the tug rail and bounded overboard. It was soon rescued from the deep, however, and here it is.
of three hours, it shaped Its course for
Manila arriving there at daylight on the
ISth. At Manila ail the extra quartermas
ter, commissary and ordnance stores were
turned in and accounts in general settled
with the several departments. Eighty
odd men availed themselves of the privi
lege of discharge in the Islands and quite
a number accepted their discharge to re
enlist in a new volunteer regiment then
being organized, In which Major Hugh
T. Sime obtained a commission. Two bat
teries of the California Heavy Artillery,
under Major Rice, were taken on board
at Cavite. as -well as some 250 discharged
soldiers and numerous other passengers.
At midnight July 26 the Sherman
sailed out of Manila Bay with the two
California commands homeward bound.
The weather had somewhat moderated,
and after a pleasant voyage of four days
and a half the good ship passed Into
Nagasaki harbor, one of the most
beautiful in the -wcrH. where the ship
coaled and obtained oth*r necessary sup
plies, the officers and nieii enjoying
thoroughly the characteristic beauties of
Japan.
On August 3 at 5 p. m.. the transport
left Nagasaki and after a most delight
ful voyage through the Inland Sea, with
its thousand islands and wondrous
beauties, Yokohama was reached early
Sunday morning, and by special permis
sion forty-eight hours was devoted to
sightseeing, Colonel Duboce having givÂ»n
full shore leave to all the offiers and men.
An agreeable surprise was in store at
Yokohama, where the American ladies,
assisted by many of the local inhabi
tants, had formed themselves into a re
ception and entertainment committee,
with headquarters on the Bund, with
ample accommodation for disbursing re
freshments and other delicate attentions.
Many of the '/"nvalescent sick were taken
ashore from the hospital and here en
tertained and cared for by the ladies.
The trip through Japan, including the two
stops with the opportunities for sight
seeing and shopping, were thoroughly
appreciated by all. and when the time for
sailing arrived it was with some" regret
that a longer time could not be given to
fathom the wonders of Japan.
At 5:30 p. m.. August 8. the Sherman
started on its last and longest run. tak
ing the "great circle route, which would
carry her Into the 48th degree north lati
tude, but after thre<= days out the weather
became so cold that on the fourth day,
having reached the 45th degree north lati
tude, and it not being considered wise to
subject the command to unnecessary
hardships, the commanding officer re
quested the captain of the ship to modify
the course, and the same was changed

added somewhat to the length of the voy
age. For several days :the weather was

Though sanitation on board and every

The all important nvss question on the

consideration and attention, and while it
has not been possible to elaborate the
army ration to any great extent, the com

numerous extras, while from the regi

account of .the fact that in all of the serv
ice at Camp Dewey and the trenches as
well during the late insurgent troubles
they were fully equipped with rifles, belts
and ammunition and did full military
duty.
Upon leaving Yokohama it was care
fully estimated that the run to the Faral
lones minht possibly be made by the 22d.
but on account of the drop to the south of
the' "great circle route" this hope was
dispelled and the schedule arranged for
the 23d.

quarantine or other detention.

SMITH'S FAREWELL.
The returning volunteers brought
home with them a letter which they :
highly prize. It is an epistle of fare
well and godspeed to the Californians,
written to them on the eve of their de- j
parture from the Philippines by Brig
adier General James F. Smith. The let
ter was thrown from the transport to
a representative of The Call last night j
by an officer of the regiment and. is as :
follows:
HEADQUARTERS
Sub-military district of the Island of
Nfgros.
BACOLOD, P. 1., July 3, 1899.
To the officers and men of the First Cal
ifornia Volunteer Infantry: Although my
promotion in a measure removed me from
the- regiment, never until now, the eve of
your departure for the United States,
have i realized that the ties which have
bound us together in a common service
were about to be broken, and that the
hour has arrived for me to bid you all
good-by and God-speed. That I cannot re
turn with you to California is to me a
matter of deep regret, for truly I covet to
the ultimate moment the companionship
of the officers and men who have served
me bo faithfully, so loyally and so well.
The moment of your triumph for the
battles you have fought, for the trials
you have Buffered, for the difficulties you
have encountered, for the' hardships you
have endured is about at hand. A grateful
people of a grateful country know all that
, you have done and are prepared to receive
1 you with open arms. Accept the homage
| of their overflowing hearts as your re.-
I ward, and enjoy your triumph unbelittled
by carping criticism of the deeds of oth
i ers or "twice told tales" of yours.
Before parting with you, never perhaps
to nit â¢ you all again, let me say that in
nothing which I have done to secure mil
itary efficient have I been actuated by
anything of personal feeling or dislike. If
I have been severe, I have been severe to
secure that discipline without which
armed men become mere mobs, inefficient,
fickle and uncertain; but in everything I
have tried to be just and impartial, and to
visit severity only on those who seemed
to deserve it, without regard to rank, pre
vious condition or friendship.
To the very few who thought I should
have taken steps to secure an earlier re
turn to California let me say that in the
interest of that same discipline I have de
dined to petition higher authorities to
cancel the solemn obligation we entered
Into with the country to remain in her j
service for two years unless sooner dis
charged. At what time the services of the 'â 
regiment could- be safely dispensed with 'â 
was a matter for higher authority, not for
me nor for the regiment to determine, and
an uninvited suggestion to change the
plan of campaign would have been just ;
as proper and more respected than a pc- j
tition to be permitted to go home. Even j
had it not been a question of discipline,
common decency and decent consistency
alike dictated that a regiment which had
asked the privilege of being allowed to
volunteer, not only for two years, but so
long as the trouble continued, and to be
sent to the front at once, should be the
very last to attempt, directly or indirect
ly, io desert the country at the time when
the services of every soldier In the Philip
pines was most required. However that
may be, l am certain that any false opin
ions which fattened on the soul-destroy
ing monotony of January sickened and i
died in the stirring month of February, i
and that every soldier of the regiment
now feels that it was better to .leave the
Government unembarrassed by requests
which could not be granted and untram
melcd by petitions which could not be
heard.
In conclusion let me thank you for the
faithfulness and honesty of your service;
let me praise you for your patience in the 1
dull routine of barrack life and for your'
endurance of conditions new and trying to
you. Let me commend you for your alac
rity in responding to every call, and honor :
you for your unflinching courage and
bravery on the battle-field.
Good-by to you allâ pleasant voyage
and a hearty welcome home. Yours as
ever, . -JAMES F. SMITH,
Brigadier General United States Volun
teers.
CALL TUG THERE FIRST.
The tug Reliance, decked from str-m to
stern with bunting and with The Call
flag flying in the breeze from her mast,
was the first vessel sighted by the volun
teers on the Sherman after the transport
had taken on a pilot off the Fara!lonr-s.
Captain Brokaw was towing the bark
Carondelet out to sea and had just got
safely over the bar when he saw the
.^moke of a big steamer in the distance
and a moment later made her out to be
the Sherman. The tug parted from her
tow in a Jiffy and went tearing through
the water toward the ship, whose coming
all San Francisco was awaiting so anxi
ously. It was then 5:15 and the Sherman

was then just inside the lightship. i
The Reliance ranged up alongside the
steamer as the latter dropped anchor a
little inside the nine-fathom buoy. As she
came abreast of the larger vessel the crew
of the tug was lined up by Captain Bro
kaw. who ordered three cheers for the
California volunteers. They were given
with a will, and the soldiers responded
just as heartily.
Then some one made out The Call flag.
"What's the matter with The Call?"'
yelled a soldier. "She's all right," came
a chorus of voices that proved the volun
teers know a good thing when they Bee it.
"Tow us in," Bang out another soldier;
but having in mind the elaborate prepa
rations for their reception and knowing
the committee was not quite prepared to
receive the boys, Captain Brokaw very
wisely declined to accept the invitation.
"You don't want to come in to-night," he
shouted in answer. "You don't know what
they are preparing for you."
"What is It?"
"Never mind, hut you will not know
Market street when you see it."
Captain Brokaw on the Reliance was
i the last to hid pood-by to the City of Pc
; king when she left this port with th? Cal
ifornia regiment aboard, bound for the
; Philippines. He remembered the Inci
! dent and was extremely proud to bo also
the first to welcome the Californlans on
; their return; but he was not the only one
to remember, as after a boat had been
lowered and placed a lot of mail aboard
The Call tup and she was preparing to
turn homeward a soldier mounted the rail
|of the Sherman and called for three
I cheers for Captain Brokaw, prefacing his
proposal with:
"Last to leave; first to receive."
More cheers, and with a parting toot
from the whistles of both vessels the Re
liance steamed back to town with the glad
I tidings and several hundred letters for ,

FINAL DETAILS
ALL ARRANGED
The citizens' executive committee had a
busy day yesterday. They were unable to
dispose of all their business at the morn-
Ing session, and agreed to meet in the
evening. In the meantime the transport
had been sighted, and the night meeting
developed Into a jollification function.
The Los Angeles delegation feared that
the members of Batteries A and D of the
Heavy Artillery were not Included In the
festivities, but the representatives from
the southern citrus belt were assured that
the l>'is Angeles soldiers would be in it
from the start to the finish.
In consideration of the patriotism shown
by the Chinese of the city it was thought
that some consideration should be shown
them. They h:ive subscribed $5415 50 to
the reception fund, or nearly 10 per cent
of the. whole amount raised. The commit
tee will have a stand built for the Celes

An urgent appeal to carriage owners for
contributions of carriages to take Invalid
soldiers to the breakfast at the ferry

the carriage committee of the Parents'

WREATHS FOR
THEIR HEROES
Among various 'patriotic ideas finding
expression in the preparations for the re
ception of the . California Volunteers Is
that of crowning them with wreaths of
California laurel. Seven Pines Circle,
aided by Sacramento and Oakland Cir
cles, Ladies of G. A. R.. are preparing
ing fifteen hundred of these wreaths.
The idea was suggested from this
stanza of the old civil war song, "When
Johnny Came Marching Home :â¢
"We all prepared a jubilee, hurrah! hur
rah!
We gave the heroes three times three,
hurrah! hurrah!
The laurel wreath of glory then
Was placed upon- those noble men,
And ail felt gay when
Johnny came marching home."
The committee having the matter in
charge consists of: Mrs. B. S. Bailey, Mrs.
C. C. Goodell and Mrs. J. Duhem. They
will crown the returned soldiers with the
wreaths and the boys will be requested
to wear the garlands on their hats dur
ing one of the parades.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
RENOTSS, Aug. 23.â The systemat
ic production of the flimsiest
trash which the prosecution
deems profitable to inflict on
the Judges in the Dreyfus case
and which the latter accept as evi
dence, was proceeded with to-day
Much of the ridiculous testimony ol
the morning was devoted to an attempt
to blast Dreyfus' private character,
though when Slaitres Labor! and De
mange had finished with the witnesses
their bubbles of tittle-tattle were bad
ly pricked.
Much of the time was occupied In
reading the testimony of Esterhazy
end Mile. Pays before the Court of
Cassation, during which many of the
audience left the court.
M. Labor! again distinguished him
self in laying bare the weak points of
the evidence. He was less fierce, how
ever, than yesterday, though quite ag
gressive enough to arouse the latent
hostility of the Judges, which showed
itself in various little ways. M. La
bori is no favorite, either, with Major
Carriere, the Government commissary,
and the .-.â¢â¢â¢ makes no serious efforts
to conceal hU feelines toward the law
yer.'
M. Laboii bore little traces of the ef
fects of the assassin's attack upon him.
He arose, sat down and moved his body
and limbs lpparently without much
difficulty. Only occasionally he put his
hands 'to >is back as though suffering
pain. His wife followed his every
movement through a gold and tortoise
shell lorgnette.
â  Mme. He jane, the actress, was again
an intereited spectator in court to-day,
'especial!? when M. Lab was on his
feet arJ his voice was vibrating
through the hall. Her eyes watched
his motile features, across which flit
ted- expressions of indignation, anger
patisfattion. with the keen in
terest with which spectators in
a thea:er follow her own acting. Dur
ing sone of the depositions M. Labori
app.ear-d very nervous. He was unable
to renain still an instant, twitching
his firgers and shaking the papers in
his haid. Counsel was almost too im
patiert to wait until the witnesses con
clude.; their testimony.
Tha only dangerous opponent of
Dreylis to-day was General Gonse,
who tounted the stage with a quick
step and apparently light heart. But
he let it badly mauled by M. Labori.
Genenl Gonse began by declaring that
he :me to defend his honor against
those "driveling" against him. But
v.hen his cross-examination was fin
ished he returned to his seat crest
fallen; for M. Labori had driven him
into a corner on the attempts of the
geners": staff to shield Esterhazy and
had ?pwn that the general staff, for
which Gonse was responsible, had en
gineer;-! Esterhazy"s escape from the
hands cC justice. The confident tones of
the gen-ral had by then dwindled into
the pro/erbial still, small voice, and
his defunt bearing had changed into
the abashed air of a schoolboy caught
telling ; lie.
PThe diy proved certainly a poor one
fr.r the general staff. Two good samples
of the nen put up to .sully Dreyfus'

citedly Denounce Their Con
tents as False.
RENNES, Aug. 23.â Maitre Labor!.
leading counsel for the defense, and lime.
Labori were present in court when the
; trial by court-martial of Captain Alfred
Dreyfus on the charge of treason was
resumed at the Lycee at 6:30 this morn
' ing. As M. Labori was entering the court
!h* was Informed by a newspaper man
that General Roget yesterday received
documents from Major Count Esterhazy,
who is now In London. Counsel was
much interested and gleaned all the in
formation possible. On the arrival In
court of General Roget It was noticed
that he carried a bulky envelope contain
ing the documents referred to.
The session began with the testimony
of minor witnesses, including Comptroller
Roy and Major Drevlell. The latter, who
is employed in the German section of the
Seconi Bureau of the AVar Office, de
posed that Dreyfus, while on the general
staff, could have had access, unpercieved,
to documents during certain hours of the
day. The prisoner, replying, admitted
that he was present during those hours,
but explained that his presence was con
nected with his duties.
The fourth witness, M. Debrleul, de- j
scribed himself as a private gentleman,
proved most entertaining and, moreover,
gave M. Labori the first opportunity to
make a few points In favor of Dreyfus.
M. Dubrieul, who was one of M. Quesnay
de Beaurepaires's witnesses, told a gos
sipy story of having met Dreyfus at the i
house of an acquaintance, M. Bodson. in
1594, when Dreyfus was a lieutenant, and
of having seen the latter conversing with ',
a man described to the witness as a Ger
man attache. Th:Â« was the sum of his
testimony, which was dotted with flashes
of unconscious humor, .- when .*l.
Dubrieul said he told his acquaintance
that he could not frequent his house if
the German visited Dim. The acquaint
ance., It appeared, replied, excusing .he
fact by saying the German was not his, ]
but his wife's friend, which caused a '
general laugh in court, which became i
louder when M. Dubrieul later remarked
that he had no prejudice against Drey
fus for visiting his acquaintance, or
rather his acquaintance's wife, adding,
"if every officer who is in love with his
1 neighbor's wife is dismissed from the
army, there would be very few left."
M. Labori took the witness in hand and
beautifully ascertained that he knew the '
visitor was a, German attache only be- |
cause he was told so, and he did not
know whether he was a military or a civil
attache. He did not even know his name.
In fact, the whole story was of the
flimsiest description. Moreover, a foreign '
military attache would have nothing to
gain by cultivating the acquaintance of a
simple lieutenant as Dreyfus was then.
Dreyfus, when he arose to reply to this ,
witness, spoke in a quiet, convincing 1 voice, I
denying that he had any relations with a !
German attache, military or civil.
M. Laborie finished with M. Dubrieul
by asking for the production of his record
in the law courts, which counsel hinted
was discreditable.
The prisoner was very indignant during :
M. Dubrieul's deposition, and one* tried

to interpose, but the president of the
'' court. Colonel Jouaust, waved him down,
telling him he might reply when M. Dub
rieul had finished, which he did as the
witness uttered his concluding words re
questing an inquiry "because it must be
made known here who is lying and who
is speaking the truth."
The statement of the prisoner made a
deep impression.
Captain Lerond deposed that Picquart In
October, 1896, connected Esterbazy with
espionage. Colonel Picquart confronted
the witness and denied the allegation.
Esterhazy was called as the next wit
ness, but there was no response, and po
; the court ordered the reading of his evi
dence as given before the Court or Cas
sation. When Estertiazy's deposition had
been finished M. Labori asked that Ester
hazy's tetters to the President of the re
public be read, in which Esterhazy is said
to have threatened, if the scandal con- !
tinued, that his Sovereign the Emperor j
would intervene.
General Gonse here asked to be allowed '
to respond to Esterhazy's testimony bj> '
| given before the Court of Cassation, and
declared in a loud voice that Esterhazy'.s
statement that he was the instrument of â¢
the general staff was an absolute lie. The |
general traversed Esterhazy's evidence, j
contradicting statementiafter statement,
and declaring that Esterhazy could hare
had relations with only Major Dv Paty de
Clam and the late Lieutenant Colonel j
Henry. The general absolutely denied
having had any relations with him.
Counsel asked that the dossier contain
ing the documents relating to the Inquiry
into the relations of Esterhazy and Dv '
Paty de Clam, instituted by Major Tra- i
vernier on behalf of the military authori- 'â 
ties, should be communicated to the court
and discussed. To this the Government ;
commissary. Major Caniere, replied that
he had applied to the military authorities'
on the subject, but his request had been i
refused.
Major Carriere added that he hoped De i
Clam would be able to come to court In a ;
few days. He added that a medical con- ;
sultation in this connection would take
place to-night and that the decision would
be announced to-morrow.
Leading counsel then submitted to Gen- j
eral Gonse a number of searching ques
tions on Esterhaxy's relations with the I
general staff. The general, as a rule ho- 'â 
came very excited, especially when asked
if th<=re was not an intrigue in favor of \
Esterhazy and if he did not take part
in it. :'J-7
"It's false, it's false," shouted the gen
eral, and from his manner one would im
agine he spoke sincerely unless he [a a
fine actor. The general, however, was vis
ibly disconcerted at several of M. Labori'*
Questions. The witness' voice grew bo
faint that it was scarcely audible. Finally
counsel asked why Esterhazy was not ar
rested after the inquiry, and General
Gonse replied:
"Because General Saussler deemed it
proper to leave him at liberty."
"Tes." retorted M. Labori." "but General
Baussier must have been deceived by the
general staff." >v=
This abrupt declaration, accompanied by !
an expressive gesture, was In counsel's :
best style and caused a sensation, amfd >
which the general returned to his sÂ°at i
looking very ill at ease.
Major Gendron. who deposed yesterday !
was recalled after General Gonse and sun

ESTERHAZY AND DREYFUS
MAY BE ACCUSED JOINTLY
BY MARCEL FÂ»RO\/OSX.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted,
1899. by James Gordon Bennett.
REXN'ES, Aug. 23.â The gang of conspirators, with General Ro?Â«t at
their head, are already. lam informed, preparing a way to retreat if M.
Bertillon. their last hope, does not succeed in making upon the Judges the
impression they hope he -will make and if the technical examination of the
borderau by Major Hartmann proves favorable to the prisoner.
In that case Roget and his following â¢would, in order to prevent the
acquittal of Dreyfus, fall back upon a new system, in which the author
ship of the borderau would be attributed to Esterhazy. An accusation of
complicity between Dreyfus and a certain W . who was. as a matter of
fact, a friend of Esterhazy and a friend of the Dreyfus family, would be
trumped up.
Dreyfus would be charged with having imprudently confided secret infor
mation to W , who repeated it to Esterhazy. who in his turn sold it to a
foreign power. Under this scheme Dreyfus' guilt would be simply that of
espionage, not of high treason. He would be found guilty, but sentenced only
to a term of imprisonment of from one to five years and at once released,
as having served that term on the Isle dv Diable. And thus the honor of the
army would be satisfied and the conscience of the Judges would be easy.
This rumor will perhaps strike the reader as pure romance, but I repeat
that it is circulating in very well informed circles. An air of probability,
moreover, is* given to it by the concordant depositions of Mercler, Cavaignac
and Zurlinden. All of them were as one in saying that even if Esterhazy had
written the bordereau Dreyfus would still be the really gruilty one in their eyes.
These declarations caused surprise when th*y were made. An explanation is
given us to-day. Dreyfu3 must be found guilty, anyhow, with or without
assistance of M. Bertillon.

The name of Mile. Pays was called, hut
i as there was no response the evidence
I which she gave befcre the Court of Cas-
I sation was read.
| General lyebelin de Dlonne testified that
Drey: declared the Alsatians were hap-
I pier under Germany than under Franco.
Dreyfus, the witness also said, complained
of his position at the school of war. The
Erisoner replied vigorously, denying: that
he ever spoke of the Alsatians as alleged,
, but admitted having used hard words on
account of his position at the school of
! war, which he declared were evoked by
i hearing that no Jews were wanted on the
general staff. i
Following are the more Important pro
ceedings in detail;
Major Dv Chatelet described the alleged
confidences of Dreyfus in regard to women
- and gambling:. Maltre Demange expressed
j surprise at the fact that the witness had
1 not mentioned this at the court-martial
; of 1594, to which Major Dv Chatelet re
plied:
'What! Here was a man accused of one
of the most heinous crimes, and you think
I ought to have detailed his confidences
in regard to women and gambling. Non
sense!"
Dreyfus briefly corrected some of Dv
; Chatelet's statements.
. Then M. Dubrieul. who described himself
j as a private gentleman, took the stand.
He testified as to how he was Introduced
| to Dreyfus by a certain Bodson, at whose
. house the witness afterward dined in !
i company with Dreyfus and a German at
, tache, whose name he did not remember.
Contiuing, M. Dubrieul said he was
greatly astonished at the suspicious fa
miliarity between the attache and Drey
fus, and that, perceiving they disapproved
â  of his presence. M. Dubrieul ceased his
visits to M. Bodson. The latter asked the
j reason for this, saying, according to the
j witness, that Dreyfus was the friend, and
| even the lover, of his wife, and asked
witness' advice as to how to get rid of
i her. Witness asked M. Bodson If he had
proofs. Bodson replied: "Proofs! Yes. I
have even proofs enough to drive Dreyfus
out of the French army." Witness, how
ever, was unable to learn to what M.
Bodson referred.
Dreyfus protested excitedly against the
i evidence of M. Dubrfeul, who is a Parisian
' friend of M. de Beaurepaire, but Colonel
â  Jouaust exhorted him to be calm, promis
' ing the prisoner a chance to reply. Thi3
! arrived shortly afterward, and Dreyfus
j thundered out:
"I won't speak here of Monsieur or
' Mme. Bodson except to say that my re
lations with Mme. Bodson ceased in ISSS
or 98, since when I have never seen
| either. I wish simply to assert that the
witness is lying. I never dined at M. Bod-
I son's with any civil or military attache.
The matter must be cleared up. People
must produce definite facts here, and not
mere tittle-tattle. The name of the person
with whom I am alleged to have dined
must be ascertained. It must be known
here who Is lying and who is speaking the
truth." (Great sensation.)

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA. Aug. 23.â
Five men are dead and ten
â¢wounded as a result of a fight
last night between gendarmes j
and disappointed Cuban soldiers
at Ceuvitas, three miles from San
. tiago, where the payment of the Cuban '
1 troops is progressing. Five thousand I
j Cubans had gathered there to receive j
i pay, and after three days only 580 had
been paid. Thousands who had been ;
I disappointed at other points had come
to Ceuvitas as the last place of pay
ment in the province.
The imperfect list causes great dis
' satisfaction, and a rumor circulated
yesterday that the paymasters would !
' leave to-day alarmed the men who had ;
not been paid. They began to collect in
groups and to show their annoyance.
. Finally their threats became serious.
Captain Baliat, with twenty gen
-1 darmes, was present to preserve order
among the applicants, and the United i
States troops protected Colonel Moale, j
> the officer having charge of the pay
! ments. Suddenly Captain Baliat, who
was mounted, was surrounded by a
| mob, struck with stones and bottles
and shot in the arm. His men prompt
ly fired a volley into the mob, three
persons being instantly killed and thir- \
| teen wounded, two of whom died this \
| morning. Colonel Moale's guard
! promptly surrounded the money office,
but took no part in the fighting.
For a few minutes there was a lively
conflict, carbines and machetes being i
used freely. Captain Baliat was the j
only gendarme wounded. The dead
were colored Cuban soldiers.
This morning payment was resumed
| under a heavy guard. There are
i rumors that a force is being organized
to attack the pay office, but these are
probably unfounded. General Castillo,
Civil Governor of Santiago de Cuba, I
i was at Ceuvitas at the time and soon
! restored order.
There is no doubt that the inaccurate
list will cause a great deal of hard
ship. Many veterans have vainly fol- j
lowed the United States Commission
ers for six weeks, only to find that their
names are not listed. General Leonard
Wood, Military Governor, does not,
However, expect serious trouble.

M. Dubrieul having supported M. La
bori's request. Colonel Jouaust announced
that he would carry it out if he could
legally do so.
At this juncture Colonel Jouaust an
nounced that it was Esterhazy's turn to
speak, but that as he was not present the
evidence which he gave before the Court
of. Cassation would be read. â  Th& clerk of
1 the court accordingly read to an mat!
-! tentive audience Esterhazy's deposition
as published in April last.
The following are passages from those
letters which were published early in
April last:
In the first letter he (Esterhazy) said: "My
house Is Illustrious enough in the annals of
) French history and In those of the great Euro
pean causes for the government of my country
to take care not to allow my name to be .
dragged in the mud. I address myself, therefore,
to the supreme head of the army and to the
President of the republic and I ask him to put
an end to the scandal, as he can and ought to
do. If I should have the sorrow not to be
listened to by the supreme head of my country
mv precautions are taken for my appeal to
reach the ears of my heraldic chief, the sov
ereign of the Esterhazy family, the Emperor
of Germany. Ke is a soldier and will know .
how to set the honor of- a soldier, even an ,
enemy, above the mean, equivocal intrigues of ]
politics. He will deare to speak out loud and ;
strong- to defend the honor of ten generations !
of soldiers. It is for you, as President of the
republic, to judge if you should force me to
carry the question into that region. An Es
terhazy fears not anything or anybody if not'
God."
In his second letter Esterhazy said: "I am
at bey and compelled to use all the means at
my power. A generous woman who warned me
of the horrible Dlot woven against me by
friends of Dreyfus with the assistance of
Colonel Picquart has since been able to procure
i for me, amonir other documents, the photo
graph of a paper which she succeeded in get- i
ting out of that officer. This pacer, stolen In i
a foreign legation by Colonel Picquart, is most '
compromising for certain diplomatic person- â 
ages. If I neither obtain support nor justice
and If my name comes to be renounced this '
photograph, which is to-day quite safe abroad, â¢
â will be immediately published."
In the third letter Eaterhazy said: "This i i
document is protection for me. since j i
It proves the scoundrellsm of Dreyfus is a dan- '
ger for my country, with Its fac simile of writ- |
ing will force France to humiliate herself or \
to declare war. You. who are above empty

General Gonse said he desired to reply j
to Esterhazy's statements. During the .
course of his observations, the genera!
said, Esterhazy's allegation that he was
the right-hand man of the general staff '
was absolutely false.
General Gonse proceeded to refer to his j
avofdance of Esterhazy during the Zola
trlaL
"'I considered him to be a compromising
person," said the witness, "and I was not
wrong. If Esterhazy was permitted to go I

was by order of General Saussier, who ,
would not accept the advice of the gen

Dv Paty de Clam alone who compromised
the entire headquarters stail by his im- j
prudence." (Sensation.)
"If I now say so for the first time it Is
because the case, against De Clam has ;
been dismissed. I could no: have spoken ;
earlier without seeming to accuse a pris- i
oner."
In conclusion. General Gonse said: i
"Colonel Kenry (I regret to speak of the ;
dead) was greatly in the wrong in send- !
ing- Gribelln to the Mont Souris interview.
Gribeiin would not have been there if I
had known it. but I had not been told."
General de Boisdeffre at this point took
the occasion to defend himself. "I ask ;
leave." he said, "only to tell the court
that I give the most absolute contradic
tion to Esterhazy's evidence."
Then, turning to counsel for the defense.
the general added: "If I were not here as I

in regard to these falsehoods that I de

they deserve." ((Great sensation.j

the Montelair line. This incline ends
abruptly in front of John Cox's hotel, at
the foot of Eagle Rock.
Mr. Smith suspected no unusual risk
until he neared a sharp curve. As h*
rounded the turn he saw with horror that
the incline was far too steep for safety.
The wheel took on greater speed tr.e
brake proving of little use. Persona at
the top of the mountain who saw Xi-.
Smith's wild run say his speed was equal
to that of the fastest locomotive ever
built. The rider's hat blew off and hi 3
hair stood up straight. Faster went the
wheel, and it looked as if Mr. Smith would
surely meftt his death. He did not dare
to try to throw himself off the wheel,
for fear of receiving serious hurts.
Luckily the bicycle did not swerve,
but kept on straight. Just as it looked a3
if wheel and rider would be dashed upon
the rocks they shot around a second curve
across the tracks of the Orange ar.d.
Passaic Valley Railway, and then down
the road alongside of Cox's hotel.
Mr. Smith saw now that all danger wr3
passed if he could maintain his coolness,
and he succeeded in doing so. but H
not until the Glen Ridge borough line was
reached that he was able to stop his bi
cycle and dismount. He sat underneath
a tree for nearly an hour before he re
gained his strength and nerve and was
able to ride home.
The rider says this was the most ter

KNEW HUNGRY JOE.
Fashionable Young Lady Amazes the
Park Row Newsboys.
"Hungry Joe." the newsman whose ec
centricities have caused Park row news
boys so much glee, leaned last night
against a toolohest which blocks the -
walk just below Beekman street, evidently
meditating about the time he threw a
rock at a boy in the middle of the s:r- :
and broke a plate-jrlass window \
him. A stylish young woman came along
with her nose in the air and a messenger
boy at her heels. She swung down tha
street with a straight-ahead gaze past
"â Hungry Joe." She went six feet beyond
him. then turned suddenly to look. She
walked riglu back to him and smiled a
smile thatVas a sight.
"Why. how art you?" she said in
amazement. "What arÂ» you doing here?"
The rest of her words were lost In a
cable-car uproar. The newsboys hugged
each other and said:
"Look at them di'mons."
Th^ young woman passed on in. a minute
and "Hungry Joe"' shook all over, smiling
very broadly. He lives in Brooklyn and
has meeting clothes which he wears on
Sunday, when his Park row friends Â«
not recognize him. As for the newsboys,
they tell about his bags of gold and coats
lined with greenbacks.

of the highesl ascriptions of courage, culture, honor

Senorita Cisneros. When did they acquire the

the r t to freedom and inde

change and lose the right of consent to their govern-
Why has our concern in their independence,
vernment and consent to government become
less than it was then?
What has made them our "subjects" and given us
the right to preserve our "honor and self-respect" by
â shooting them down if they make a move toward de

it they ciaim it now? The Oregonian and those who
stand with it employ the same language and back it
with the same reasons as that used by the butcher
nations in the hacking of Poland and by the Czar in
the blow he has recently struck the Finns.
When the Oregonian speaks in lofty phrase of the
folly of "a civilized government resting on a moral
I asts," consulting the wishes of a subject people, it
means just as the Czar means, a strong Government
resting upon a vast army and refusing to consult the
interests of the weak whom it can crush.
The lion does not consult the wishes of the lamb
as to the dinner hour.
We don't know the definition of a moral basis for
government which would please those who coolly
propose to complete in Cuba the butchery that Spain
began. It is supposed that the basis of right and
wrong, the elementary definition of the two principles,
may be found in the Bible, and that there the rights
of the weak against the strong have some support.
It is not new that the strong covet what belongs to
rak.
"And Ahab spake unto Naboth saying, Give me
thy vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs.
And Naboth said to Ahab. The Lord forbid it me that
I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto
thee. And Ahab came into his house heavy and dis
pleased. And Jezebel his wife said unto him" â
when has any civilized Government renting on a
moral basis submitted its policies to the determina
tion of an inferior or subject people? â "Dost thoa
now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise and eat
b-ead and let thy heart be merry. I will give thee
the vineyard." In the enforcement of this policy
Ahab prevailed and Naboth was killed, as there was
no other way of honor and self-respect for Ahab; and
then came the prophet asking the king. "Hast thou
killed and also taken possession? In the place where
the <'ot^s lirlced the blood of Naboth shall the dogs
lick thy blood, even thine."
The day that a shot is fired in Cuba because those
people rise for independence and self-government,
which we solemnly said of right belong to them, will
be a day of reckoning.
The boys arrived twenty-four hours earlier than

OUR CALIFORNIA SOLDIER BOYS ARE BACK,
CALIFORNIA has a novel experience. Until the outbreak of the Spanish war she
had not the opportunity to appear by a military organization of her sons in any
series of high actions at arms. Her peculiar situation during the Civil War called
for all her military resources upon a far-stretched picket line, from which the intruder
was challenged and guard kept for the Union over the solemn deserts and frowning moun
tains that made a wide frontier between us and the great battle fields. Xo element in
I that mighty struggle contributed more to its successful result than this cheerfully assumed
â¢ duty of California. It was the guarding against invasion and alienation of a vast region,
â  to which the nation has since resorted for its gilding oi the precious metals and its sweet
1 store of luxuries. Without those California troopers who stood true to the flag which
' they protected the Confederate line would have covered the country from the Rio Grande
to the Golden (iate, and the wealth of our mines would have filled the treasury and
equipped the hard fighters of the Confederacy and perhaps, at any one of the critical
periods of the war. have turned against us the scale that was more than once on even
balance. That duty so well done saved to the Union in military expenditure more than
! thirty millions of dollars, and if it also saved the Union how inestimable was its value!
When the cry of men in despair and of women dying under the hard heel of the
pressor, like a bugle call to duty in a humane war, thrilled American manhood, Cali
fornia sprang to arms and reported ready for service in a day. In the incidents of the
Spanish battle against the free aspirations of her colonists all men suffered who had
known the liberty for which they died daily. California is not dense in her population,
but if the country had called her to supply the full force of 17,000 men that brought the
Spanish war to a close they would have been under arms and on the march to where the
foe lurked within a week.
Her First Regiment of Volunteers drew the prize in the patriotic lottery of war
and her Seventh and Eighth regiments lay for weeks underarms, cherishing their brave
and unfaltering purpose and chafing in their war harness, waiting and hoping for orders
to glory and the front.
As the First marched to take ship and sail away its path was sprinkled by the
tears of thousands, and the ringing measure of its march was lost in the tempest of cheers
that voll 1 mile s the farewell of a people wrought to high fervor by the sight of men
'going forth as a sacrifice that the burden of strangers might be lightened and the heavy
hand of the truck from its wrist.
The manly promise of their soldierly presence then has been kept. No expecta
tion held in all the throng of thousands on the day of that farewell was too high for the
that justified it. The First California has shown every talent and capac
ity ; Â»ms a militan organization. From its ranks stepped out men who could
build a military railroad and operate it. string a military telegraph and not only guard
but work it. Every craft and art auxiliary to war and useful in peace was represented
' in the ranks of our volui t< rs. No duty required in march, charge, siege and battle found
i them at any hour Unprepared. They honored their State by their soldierly initiative;
' every man them was fit to command, therefore all were qualified to obey. \\ ith
the j eathand the deathly vertical sun above them they toiled and fought
if born I- ingle. If an order were delayed they knew their duty and charged
without it. If retn â¢ - Â»unded it rang upon deaf ears as long as an enemy was in front.
Equally when they fought and when they fell they honored their State. As they
I knew how to live like soldiers, like soldiers they knew how to die: as in their action there
was - courage, when death came it was met with unmatched dignity.
To-day they are with us again. The State has risen in a passion of welcome to
â¢t them back. All that can express a feeling that may not all be uttered is done to
gladden their coming home. Thousands are in a frenzy of delight to hear again the
music of their feet alonir the path down which they marched away. As its notes rise and
fall in regular measure there will be wailing for the broken harmony. The ranks are not
! full. The roster of the dead is called and the answer comes in the last sigh from the far
1 field of honor.
For these there is every delightful evidence of honor and gratitude: for those,
memory arid tears.
READY FOR THE RECEPTION.
OUR boys are with us. lhey arrived sooner
than was expected, but find the people ready
and alert to give them such a reception as has
never be.'ore been accorded in California to any
iw high their rank. Thousands
of visitors from all parts of the State are here, and
as soon as The Call gave notice that the transport
een sighted the outburst of joy began, and will
increase in vigor and intensity until the welcome cul
minates in loud, triumphant cheers greeting the re
turning heroes as they march through the streets
made beautiful by a thousand decorations in their
h< m< ir.
The people of San Francisco have given unmis
takable evidence of their patriotic regard for the re
turning troops. They have contributed to the recep
tion fund not only the $50,000 asked for by the ex
ecutive committee, but many thousands more. In
addition to the sums thus donated other large
amounts have been expended in private decorations of
buildings in all parts of the city. In fact, San Fran
cisco is more radiant this week than ever in her his
tory, and the occasion will not only do honor to her
volunteers but will reflect credit upon her citizens.
Now that the day of the reception is at hand the
people will feel more keenly than ever the wrong done
by the pettishness of the Governor in refusing to make
the day of disembarkation a public holiday. Thou
sands of working men and women, whose patriotism
is not less strong than that of other citizens and who
would have had great joy in welcoming the troops,
will be debarred from that pleasure by the Governor's
inability to sympathize with the patriotic aspirations
of the people, and no little indignation will be justly
felt with regard to it.
It is the duty of our municipal officials and of em
ployers to do what they can to right the wrong. Let
us make a civic holiday as far as it is possible to do so.
The people have contributed freely to provide the
decorations of the streets, the banquets,- the illumina
tions, the fireworks, the concerts and the reception
festivals in honor of the volunteers, and it is but right
that all should have a share in the enjoyment of the
great day.
Rarely has a public enterprise of anything like
equal magnitude been carried out so harmoniously or
with such success as this. The executive committee
merits the commendation of all for its energy and its
zeal in the work. Everything has been arranged in
order and completed in time. S.m Francisco is ready
for her volunteers. They will enter the bay amid
one of the finest naval demonstrations ever seen in
American waters, and when they land their welcome
will be all that the enthusiasm of the people can give.
All hail our heroic brave!
The patriotic impulses of the week ought to be felt
in the municipal conventions and incline the deie
' pates to insist upon the nomination of true patriots
on both tickets.
If the West Indian hurricane carried no good in its
progress, it at least gave the natives that are left
something to blow about for some time to come.
France seems to be suffering from an overplus of
plots. That's where she has the best of the average
American comic opera.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 24, 1899.
To the hern, when his sword
Is drawn in battle for the free,
Death's voice sounds like a prophet's word,
And in its hollow tones are heard
The thanks of millions yet to be.
RUMORS of many kinds concerning the prob
able course of Tom Reed have been rife ever
since his return from Europe. For some rei
son he refused to state whether or no he would re
sign his seat in Congress, and such statements as he
made concerning political subjects inclined a good
many people to believe that while he would not be a
candidate for the Speakership he would remain in
Congress during the coming session for the purpose
of taking part in shaping the policy of the country
toward Cuba and the Philippines.
To all such rumors he ha> now put an end hy send
ing his resignation of his seat in Congres-, to the Gov
ernor of Maine. The strongest personal force in
American politics has retired from it. and the loss to
the republic is much greater than it would be easy to
tell. The recent development of American politics is
such as to make conservatism in official station of the
highest value to the country. Mr. Reed could have
been counted on to oppose all foolish schemes of im
perial annexation and foreign conquests just as reso
lutely as he opposed all wildcat money schemes, and
it is for that reason his retirement will be deplored by
intelligent men of all parties.
A short time ago, in discussing the immigration
problem, Mr. Reed is reported to have declared there
would be a grave inconsistency in shutting out immi
grants from Europe on the score of their unfitness
for republican government and American citizenship
while at the same time expending millions of treasure
and thousands of lives in forcibly annexing to the
United States islands of the Orient swarming with
people even more unfit to assimilate with American?,
than any seeking admission as immigrants. By that
statement he made clear his appreciation of the
menace of imperialism and inspired a hope that he
would remain in Congress to fight it.
The republic stands at the parting of the ways,
with momentous issues depending upon the choice of
which road to take. It is a juncture that calls for the
service in official life of the ablest statesmen we have.
The retirement of Reed will therefore be noted with
more regret, for Congress is to lose his leadership at
a time when that leadership is perhaps more needed
than ever.
Fortunately, Mr. Reed's retirement is not likely
to be permanent. Other great statesmen have retired
before. Henry Clay once left politics to go home "to
repair his fences," as he said, but it was not long be
fore he grew weary of farming and gladly profited by
an opportunity- to return to the Senate. Mr. Blainr
also retired from politics at one time, but returned
again. Many another statesman has done the same.
Reed's retirement can hardly mean a cessation of his
interest in politics. He will be always keenly alive
to public questions, and in due season he will drop his
law business in New York and return to the work
for which nature fitted him and by which he can best
serve the welfare of his country.
The Call was first to announce to the city the ar
rival of the Sherman and thus once more demon
strated its superiority over its contemporaries in
gathering and circulating news.
There are no microbes on Admiral Dewey. At
least he has refused to fly the yellow flag of the yel
low Journal on the sea of politics.

COMMUNICATIONS
AMERICAN SHIPBUILDING.
TO the Editor of The Callâ Sir: The
article in this morning's issue of your
valuable paper anent th ' ;
Pa: ne shipping bill, and th<
menta attributed to the Commissioner of
Navigation should demonstrate to the
most casual observer that this bill is not
the bugaboo its prejudiced and unthink
ing opponents would have the publi< be
lieve it to be. That the controlling prin
ciple? <-f tin- measure i r< laid along cor
rect lines cannot be successfully <â â â 
The capitalist, the fa ra
artisa:. and laborer, in far! ail class
citizens in the United States ;v>- directly
affected by the progress or otherw
our shipping industry. The skeptic may
ask why all classes arc thus affected,
but if he stopped to think for a moment
the answer would dawn upon him. We
are a great producing nation, we feed the
hungry of other nations with our farm
products, and we are crowding the
markets "f the world with our surplus
manufactures, and yet while this is ad
mittedly true, nearly all our export trade
is carried in foreign bottoms and always
will be while we pursue our present
course. We are thus finding profitable
employment for the capital and labor of
other countries to the exclusion and
shameless neglect of our own.
This is not in keeping with the spirit
of our laws or the genius of our pc iple
as a progressive commercial nation.
While we are quick and enterprising in
most things, yet in this one instance we
are .sadly lacking, notwithstanding the
object lesson taught us by the great com
mercial nations of the world, who for
years have given substantial encourage
ment to their merchant marine. Too long
have our shipping Interests been cruelly
neglected. No other Interest or industry
h.ss been permitted to languish and al
most perish for want of that kindly as
sistance which has been accorded to other
Industries of Infinitely less importance.
The argument that American pluck and
enterprise are equal to any and all
emergencies will* not suffice. Private
enterprise, lie it %ver so energetic and
willing, cannot successfully compete in
carrying freight and passengers with
heavily subsidized lines.
Thus it i< that the American ship
builder is forced to retire, it is foolish
and unreasonable to expect men to build
and man vessels and run them at a loss
as they certainly are when brought into
active competition with the government
assisted vessels of other nations.
No more just or meritorious measure
than the Hanna-Payne bill has engaged
tlie attention Of Congress during th<
twenty-five years. The passage of this
bill me;u:s the profitable employment of
b"tJi capital and labor. It will give an
'.:.; recedented Impetus to one- of our most
Important but sadly neglected Industries.
It will cheapen ocean fares and freights,
and re-establish our (lag and lohl
prestige on the seas as a great and grow
ing commercial nation. It wiU thrill the
heart -if evei American who gots abroad
to see the Hag of his country proudly
floating in the breeze, w.avlng its pro
tecting folds from many 'mastheads in
the ports of the world.
As we are undoubtedly going to have a
magnificent navy, a splendid and efficient
merchant marine is the best possible re
cruiting ground from which to obtain
man-o'-war'smen. No amount of spe
cious argument can wipe out this fact.
England depends upon her merchant ves
sels to supply her navy with trained and
competent sailors, but we cannot offer
such essentials to our navy except we

THE BIG PROBLEM.
anora greater inducement to our shio
ping industry.
But many and numerous are the enemies
of the Manna bilL One would think that
in a seaport city like San Francisco it
would lj.; impossible to find an intelligent,
thinking man opposed to a measure calcu
lated to promote the welfare of this peo
ple, as well as 1 he interests of the Pacific
Coast as a whole. And yet such a man
is here. *
'I he amendment to the bill introduced at
the instance of Hugh Craig, namely, that
an export bounty be paid upon all farm
produce, was a body blow. It was a sense
less, wanton and cruel blow. This amend
ment was intended to have but one effect,
the killing of the bill; and it may do so
yet if steps are not taken to prevent It.
This community cannot afford to be
apathetic in the matter, as it strikes a
vital blow at the progress and prosperity
of this port as a commercial center.
Immediately Congress meets steps
should be taken to have that foolish
amendment withdrawn. Congress should
not have an opportunity to discuss it, as
discussion will only tend to confuse the
whole subject matter without correspond
ing benefit to either industry.
Was it self-interest, spite or notoriety
that induced Mr. Craig to have such a
fatal amendment proposed to this bill?
Whatever his motive, he has done the
measure Irreparable injury without doing
the farming Interests any good.
Mr. Craig could not have studied the
effects of the measure as regards farm
produce.
The 11; Mia bill can be classed as a di
rect bounty to the farming interests as
well as to the shipping. The bounty-fed
foreign vessels that to-day are carrying
most of our foreign trade will be com
peting for a share of our trade even after
our subsidized vessels are running. The
result will be reduced freights. The
farmer, of all men, is the one who is
bound to profit by this competition, as it
will enable him to land his farm produce
in foreign ports cheaper than he can do so
to-day. All this means increased profits
and cheaper freights, which means greater
advantage over competitors in the foreign
markets of the world.
No. Mr. Craig, you have committed a
grievous blunder and seriously affected
the probable passage of a measure so well
calculated to assist an important but per
ishing industry, and the only way by
which you can repair the damage is by
causing the withdrawal of your amend
ment. Should you refuse to do so, then
it is the duty of the people of this city
to see that it is done. "

PIERCY MAKES
A COMPROMISE
Settles With Miss Pyle
for a Small Sum.
Special Disnatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE. Aug. 23.â Capitalist Edwaru
M Plercy has rid himself of the *30,<>}0
bjeach of promise lit Drought by Jessie
M. Pyle. who claimed her life and a flee
t'on had been damaged to that extent by
the Poieullst leader's falling to fulfill his
promise of marriage. As a balm for her
injured feelings she has received $100 in
gold. This release of the clara on Piercy
was filed in Oakland on A .- -â¢ 17. and
to-day a duplicate copy of it went on
rtccrd here. It states:
"I, Jessie M. Pyle, have received $100 in
gold Â£rom Edward M. Pier y and release
him from all claims of every kind, na
ture and character whatsoever I may
have against him from the beginning of
the world to this day." *
Church & Snook of Oakland acted as
attorneys for Piercy in the matter.
The Pyle-Piercy breach, of promise suit
has been a long-drawn-out legal battle
and has been before thÂ« court for several
years.
Miss Pyle claimed Piercy had wronged
her under promise of marriage and de
manded $50,000 damages. Two children or
hers she claimed were of Piorcy's pater
nity. The case was extremely sensational
and one of her witnesses was arrested
on a charge of perjury, but was finally
discharged. A jury in the Superior Court
awarded her $12,000 damages and Plercy
was taxed costs amounting to $3300. An
appeal was taken to the Supreme Court
ana the judgment was reversed and a now
trial was ordered. The second trial was
to begin in a few days.
During the litigation Piercy hired and
discharged numerous attorneys, and sev
eral suits grew out of this matter. He
transferred his property to his mother,
and a judgment against him now would
be almost worthless.
Miss Pyle acted In the settlement with
out the consent of her attorneys.
Plercy is one of the best known men in
the county. He is a prominent Populist
and worth In the neighborhood of $lao,ooo.

MANILA, Aug. 23.âThe United
States cable steamer, Hooker,
stranded on a reef In Corre
gidor harbor, has been thrown
on her beam ends by the heavy
seas and was temporarily abandoned
last night. There is only the smallest
possible chance' that the 100 miles of
cable on board the Hooker can be tak
en off by the gunboat Espana. The
Hooker is pounding hard upon the
rocks and the chances of saving her
are regarded as hopeless.
The transports Zealandia and Valen
cia sailed for San Francisco to-day.
General Wheeler and daughter visited
the hospitals in Manila to-day. They
expressed great satisfaction at their
condition. It is the intention of Miss
"Wheeler to devote herself to hospital
nursing.
Secret service authorities are on the
trail of the reported Japanese filibus
ters along the coast. The Mayor of Bal
inag, the first town in which civil gov
ernment was established by General
Lawton, has been arrested for alleged
treachery to the American cause and
brought to Manila. He is specifically
accused of soliciting funds for the in
surgents and communicating with the
enemy. He claims he is a victim of
spite. It is believed he holds the rank
of colonel in the insurgent service.
The Mayor of San Pedro Macati, with
five accomplices, was arrested last
night in a brickyard near the town.
There is abundant evidence they were
recruiting for the Filipino army.
Three Spaniards who have been held
as prisoners by* the Filipinos for the
past year have arrived at Calamba.
They relate a thrilling tale of escape
and "pursuit through the Jungles. They
say they were constantly compelled to
perform the hardest kind of work In
digging trenches, grinding rice, etc.,
with armed guards standing over them.
These men say the Filipinos .have one
regiment fully equipped with Japanese
rifles, but the supply of ammunition
for these weapons is limited.

GREAT POWER OF
DYNAMITE SHELL
Heavy Steel and Oak Target Blown to Pieces
by a New Projectile on Its First
Official Test
NEW YORK, Aug. 23.â At the Sandy Hook proving grounds to-day
an experiment was made with a dynamite shell which tended to prove
that if it had struck a battleship the vessel would have been sunk. The
experiment was ordered by the Board of Ordnance and Fortifications.
It took place In the. presence of members of the board. Major Pleath,
who is in charge of the defenses at Sandy Hook, and "Willard S. Isham,
Inventor of the projectile.
The shell, made from about 900 pounds of cast steel and carrying
a bursting charge of 129H pounds of explosive gelatine, commonly called
dynamite, was fired from an ordinary 12-inch rifle mounted on an Im
provised carriage behind a shield. About 200 fe^t in front of the gun a
piece. of Harveyized steel twelve inches thick and specially treated was
placed at an angle of 45 degrees to the line of fire. Behind it was a
thick backing of oak, and behind the oak a small mountain of sand, the
whole calculated to be stronger than a battleship's side. It was a se
vere test of the sliell in that the steel was placed at an angle.
An ordinary shell, upon striking a ship obliquely, usually glances
off â¢without harming the vessel. This Isham shell had stored In It, ac
cording to estimate, energy sufficient to more than raise 75,000 tons one
foot. Carrying its 129^ pounds of hidden destruction, it was hurled
against the steel at a velocity of about 2000 feet a second. It struck
and exploded with a terrific report. When those who had been watch
ing half a mile away reachpd the spot they found the steel target had
been blown clear up the oak backing and lay seventeen feet to one side
and at right angles to the line the shot had followed. Part of the oak
backing and sand behind it were also blown away. Only four pounds
of steel fragments of the shell were found.
It was the unanimous opinion that If the steel had been held flrmly
the sh"ll would have blown it to pieces. The most destructive explosive
known was used in the sh^ll. It was composed of 88 per cent of nitro
glycerine. 8 per cent of guncotton as an absorbent and 4 per cent of cam
phor. It is estimated to be 25 per cent more powerful than \o. 1 dy
namite. '
BANTERS A MAN INTO
LEAPING TO HIS DEATH
Then a Louisville Citizen Attempts to Col

tim Carried,
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Aug. 23.â 1t has come to light that Thomas He
bee, a white man who jumped from the Big Four bridge across the
river here several days ago and killed himself, was actually "jollied"
Into the act with a view of collecting the insurance upon his life. He
bee had four small policies on his life which he had transferred to R. J.
Donahue, a saioon-Jteeper at Clay and Mui:i streets. Hebee had often
bragged about his abilities as a jumper from high places, and Donahue
and some of his friends bantered him to jump from the Big Four bridge
into the river. So one day when Hebee was hnif drunk he told his com
panions at Donahue's place he would show them he could dive from the
bridge. He went out to show them how ea?y it was to jump from the
bridge, and was taken out of the waters of th^ Ohio River a corpse. The
distance Hebee leaped was 140 feet. The day after the fatal leap Dona
hue appeared in court and had an administrator appointed for Hebee's
estate. Now the brothers of the dead man are petitioning the courts to
protect their interests In the premises, and charge that Hebee was in
duced to jump by Donahue In order to realize on the policies.

vices from the Orient brought on the
steamer Kinshiu Maru give details of
the negotiations for an alliance be

progress when the Kinshiu Maru left!
Shortly prior to her departure a se< ret
missi..:: was sent to Japan by the
Empress Dowager to invite Marquis
[to to China to reform the Government
and also to ;??k the Mikado to confirm
a proposed offensive and defensive alli
ance and if this could not be accom
plished to get Japan to consent to help
China in defending the provinces of
Chekiang and Fukien from Italy or any
other foreign power, in consideration of
which Japan would be allowed to have
the whole and sole exploitation of the
mines and a majority of the railway
lines in the two provinces.
The mission was also to ask that
Japan should undertake the training
Â;â¢ (â¢â ; in consideration of
which Japan should return the !'â¢ i
captured by her at Weihaiwei, be ides
t her arrangements for
mutual benefit, which so far have not
yet transpired, it was to prepare the
way for these secret negotiations that
the Japanese Government had to urge
the departure from Japan of Kang Yu
Wei and other Chinese reformers who
had taken refuge there in order not to
give umbrage t< the Empress Dowager
and her supporters.

JACKSON KNOCKED OUT.
Jim Jeffords Itefeats the Colored
Pugilist in Four Rounds.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Aug. 23.â Jim Jef
fords, the California heavyweight,
knocked out Peter Jackson, the colored
pugilist, in the fourth round of a warm
contest here to-night. Jeffords simply
had his own way all the way through,
and could have knocked out the colored
man at any stage of the game. At the
end of the second round the fortunate
pounding of the gong wits the only thing
that saved Peter. The latter was groggy
md he fell against the ropes with his
whole weight as the result of repeated
blows on the jaw and head and, in fact,
showered pretty well all over the anatomy
of the colored man by Jeffords. Peter
did not hit a hard blow In the whole con
test. .:,'-.â 
The third round saw some heavy but in
effective lighting, and Peter seemed to
come up in good trim for the fourth, but
the fact that he was outclassed was never
so apparent as when he went down
squarely on tTie broad of his back from
a number of stiff swings from the Callfor
nian. Peter staggered slowly to his feet,
when he had been all but counted out.
and Jeffords was about to finish him off
when the gong sounded. The fight was
Immediately given to Jeffords.

ARCHBISHOP RIORDAN
ISSUES AN ADMONITION
ASKS CATHOLICS TO ATTEND
CHURCH THIS NIGHT.
Services to Be Held Throughout His
Diocese in Compliance With
Command of the Pope.
The triduum preparatory to the services
nf the Solemn Consecration of ManKind
to the Bacred Heart will begin this even
ing in ail the Catholic churches of the
archdiocese presided over by his Grace
the Most Reverend Archbishop Patrick
W. Rlordan. On Sunday night this great
act "t religion, by the command of the
Sovereign Pontiff, will take place on the
feast of the Most Pure Heart of Mary.
The necessity of all Catholics attending
th>-se solemn services is emphasized in the
following admonition which has been Is
sued by the Archbishop:
I desire to admonish the laity of the Arch
diocese that this consecration, devised by the
universal charity of the Vicar of Christ for
the eternal welfare of the human family, will
rather make for the condemnation of men if
they wilfully turn away from the graces it
enters them Upon the children of the house
hold of faith lies the obligation of correspond
ing, first of all, with the summons to draw
near to that divine heart which yearns to
draw near to them. By so doing they will ob
tain special blessings for themselves and win,
moreover, from that heart, which is the over
flowing fountain of all grace, more abundant
and efficacious help for those outside the fold
to hear the life-giving voice of the Son of
God speaking to them through his representa
tive on earth. Wherefore, I earnestly and
affectionately exhort- all the faithful to attend
the exercises of the'-Triduum with the utmost
diligence, to purify their souls In the sacra
ment of penance, to as to be fit to receive the
heavenly favors our Lord desires to shower
upon them on this occasion; and let each one
of them Rive, on the day of consecration, the
pledge of his Individual homage to the Sacred
Heart of Jesus by receiving his Savior and
King in the adorable sacrament of love.

George Klarmann of the Olympic
Club Defeats James Corbett
in the Fifty- Yard
Race.
Special .Dispatch to. The Call.
ASTORTA, Or.. Aug. 23.â 1n many
respects the sixth annual regatta, which
closed this evening, was not so success
ful as the carnival of last year. Bad
â weather had much to do with this, and,
where 20,000 strangers saw the race? in
3S9S not over 12.0W fame to Astoria this
year.
The closing- day w:is fair and the rac-
Ing excellent. In the morning the rowing
events v.ere pulled off, the single shell
race being first called. There were live
entries, Patton of Portland and Dennis,
Foley, Whltkop* and Sternberg of Cali
fornia. Dennis and Foley were well In
the had at the stake, Patton being four
length!) behind. In rounding the make
Folej dropped behind to avoid fouling
Dennis! After turning Patton came up
strongly and soon was within a length
of Dennis, The latter got off the course
and lost over a length, I'atton passing
him. Dennis made strenuous efforts to
overtake the Portland man, but the latter
won by less than a quarter of a length.
Had the race continued for another 100
yards Dennis surely would have won.
The time was 12:32.
In the four oared barge race the Uni
versity of California crew went against
the Alamedas. The Varsity men gave
the champions a hard run and the barges
were only a few lengths apart at the
finish. The time was 11:28
Th.- International race saw a hard
struggle between the Alamedas and the
Britishers The Californians were to have
used the Astoria Club's shell, but found
it Impossible t<> do so and used their
barge, the Vancouver crew using a shell.
This of course, greatly handicapped the
Alamedas, but they pulled good stroke
and finished only a few lengths behind
the Northern oarsmen. The Brit.
cheered the Alamedas for the good race
that they rowed;
In the afternoon the yachts, were sent
away for a three mile race for special
prizes. The wind was not heavy, and it
was expected the Pearl, which capsized
Monday, would win. The Dauntless again
. .m. but victorious, however, having
won every sailing race In the year's re
gatta, The yachts got away in a bunch
and the course proved a pretty appear
ance as the big boats were sailing the
race, .-.".
â  Seven thousand people saw the field
sports at the A. :â¢". C. grounds in the
afternoon. A baseball game between the
Chemawa Indian team and the Mult
nomah cine was the opening feature. The
game resulted in an easy victory for the
Indiana, the score being 12 to 5.
The mile race went to George Klar
maiin of the Olympic Club of San Fran
cisco. His opponent was James Corbett
of Astoria, who led until within fifty
yards of the mark, when Klarmann
spurted by him.
. The two-mile bicycle race was won by
O. Tangen, and the mile bicycle race
went to D. McCrosky. Both men are
Astorians. The field programme Included
many Interesting events, among them
an exhibition sparring match. â

more than 12,000 people. The $2000 stake

Splendid Contest at
Readville.
DARKNESS CAUSES DELAY
TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PURSE
IN DOUBT.
Decision by the Judges Causes a <
Clamor With Much Argument
On Both Sides of the
Question.
Sr>eclal DlsDatch to The Call.
READVILT.E, Mass., Aug. 23.â The
Massachusetts stake of $10,000, the bigs^st
on the card of to-day's grand circuit
racing on the Keadvllle track, by a de
cision of the Judges at dark, is unfinished,
and three horses have an equal chance
to win It to-morrow, having won two
heats each.
The race was without question one of
the UneHt exhibitions ever seen on this
or any other track, and the judges' de
cision found favor and objection alike
from the excited throng which had poured
out upon the track in the gathering tog
and darkness. Tomboy, Owned by Frank
Jones of Portsmouth; Lecco, the fa
vorite, a Boston stallion, and the stallion
Charley Ilerr, are left to battle to a
finish, and to-night the result Is in doubt,
with Tomboy the favorite.
At the end of the second heat it looked
as If Mr. Jones' stable was again on the
winning side, and a little later, when
Tom Marsh drove Mr. Jones' Who Is It
to an easy victory in the 2:20 trot, that
opinion was strengthened. Mr. Jones has
three winners thus far In the meet.
The day was lowering, but the crowd
at the track was the biggest yet The
track was quite mealy from last night's
rain, and was made very heavy later by
a drizzle and foX which came in from the
sea. The dampness did the most to upset
calculations, for the heats began to be
decided in their home stretch, with the
strongest horses well at the front. Some
times the time suffered a little, but so
many finishes were whipping ones that
the average was not cut much.
The stake race brought out fifteen
starters, with Bonnatella (2:10%) the
strong favorite, in the fifteenth place;
Fred Kohl (2:07%) sixth; Tomboy u:ii' 4 )
eleventh and Queen Allied u:i^ : ' 4 Â» at the
pole. J:i the first two heats Tomboy and
Charley Herr fought all the way from the
first quarter to the wire. Bach time
Lecco broke repeatedly, but would
steady down so that in the stretch he
strode by the tield with great ease and
got li is nose to the leaders' Hanks, and
then all the drivers would whip their
horses.
The next time Tomboy showed a tired
feeling and Heir was so strong that no
one questioned his right to lead until the
last quarter, when the favorite 1 , Bonna
tella, ir.ade her backers happy by a grand
but fruitless burst of speed. Stirpol also
showed up well, but Lecco's breaks kept
him back. In the fourth heat Lecco did
not break, and after racing Herr all the
way around, made an easy finish by two
lengths. The h'fth heat was similar, and
the question of putting the race over
arose. With darkness coming on the
judges called out the heat winners. The
word v. as quickly given and LeCCO and
Charley Herr began to leave Tomboy In
the rear. I^ecco broke at the quarter,
half and three-quarters, each time drop
ping back many yards, but yet only half

LIPTON IS PLEASED.
Mildly Reproves Experts Who Figure
on Shamrock's Chances.
LONDON, Aug. 23.â Sir Thomas Llpton,
In an interview with a reporter of the
Associated Press to-day, said:
"I am just as excited as a schoolboy as
the race draws near. I have read the
remarks of American yachting experts,
many of whom have seen the Shamrock
through their telescopes. But while these
good people know all about yachts, they
have no data upon which to base opin
ions, except patriotic wishes. Any man
knows the Shamrock has done nothing
yet beyond wear down the Britannia on
time allowance, and pretty easily. So, to
whittle the Shamrock's chances down to
the luck of heavy weather is beside the
mark, for, in my opinion, Fife has de
signed an all-round yacht. There is
nothing absurd in the secrecy maintained.
We have reasons for It.
"It is quite true I asked the Prince of
Wales to witness the races. No one
would be happier than he to accept the
invitation, but his engagements pre
vented. We may yet have distinguished
guests. I am not at liberty to mention
their names."
Continuing, Sir Thomas Lipton ex
pressed great satisfaction with the Sham
rock's crew. He said:
'â¢Even now every man knows his sta
tion and his duty. With two skilled cap
tains we shall get the highest yachts
manship. The Americans know my feel
ings. We want to win, and if we do 1 be
lleve they will shout as loud as if the
Columbia won, for our opponents are
sportsmen. If the Shamrock is success
ful no doubt the Americans will rise to
the occasion and next year make us exert
our very best efforts to retain the cup."
It is said that Captain "Benn" Parker,
the skipper of Emperor William's
yacht Meteor, at the suggestion of
Sir Thomas Lipton, the owner of
the America's cup ctiallenger Sham
rock, asked his Majesty's permission to
sail the Shamrock in her coming races in
the. T'nited States and received a reply
peremptorily forbidding him to do so.
Emperor William is reported to have
told Parker to have nothing to do with
the America cup race. It is added that
his Majesty assigned no reason.

heart believe the time has come and
have induced Mr. Harrison to accede to
their request. .As a result Ills name heads
the list of officers presented to the elect
ors of the club for their .suffrages.

the club has ever had, has been honored

on this coast, is among the directors nom
inated. The election of these men is
looked upon as a forerunner of prosperity

Dates.
OPEN THE SEASON EARLY
CORRIGAN IS EXPECTED HEBE
\ NEXT WEEK.
Racing to Begin at Oakland Septem
ber 21â Announcement
Hailed With Satisfaction
by Horsemen.
The threatened racetrack war is on.
Yesterday the California Jockey Club, of
which association Thomas 11. Williams Jr. ;
is president, announced that the gates of j
its Oakland track will be thrown open to
the public on September 21, after the ;
State Fair at Sacramento, for the fall
and winter season of 1899-1900.
This move on the part of the California
Jockey Club is not an unexpected one.
Some weeks ago the Western Turf Asso
ciation, the successor to the now defunct
I Pacific Coast Jockey Club, made known
j to the public through Secretary Green that
i racing on the new track at. San Bruno
! would commence on, November 0. At the ,
i same' time President Henry J. Crocker of j
i the San Bruno track intimated in an inter
i view that his club had not as yet ar
! ranged on dates with the Oakland people.
While It has been denied that Ed Corn
gan. whose arbitrary methods caused the
! closing of Ingleside track, was Interested j
! in the Western Turf Association, he has
j been generally recognized by those on the j
! inside as "the power behind the throne ,
in tile San Bruno venture. The dethroned j
ruler of Hawthorne is expected to arrive
here next week to look after his interests.
When Interviewed some days ago on the j
i local racing situation. President Williams
j of the California Jockey Club said that I
I he had made what he considered a. very j
j advantageous proposition to Mr. Crocker. I
"Rather than see a third racetrack con
structed, which I knew," said Mr. Wil- I
liams, "would ultimately result in causing ,
trouble, I said that if the Paciilc Coast |
Jockey Club would allow the racing to
continue through the season at Oakland
i without a break the California Jockey
; club would give the Ingleside association
I one-half of the profit derived thereby.
I Mr. Crocker said that it was too late;
i that work had already been commenced
on the new track. At the same time," i
; continued Mr. Williams, "1 do not think ;
| three spadefuls of dirt had been turned."
I The Ingleside folks were also accused of
favoring the passage of certain measures
at the last Legislature inimical to the
better interests of racing.
The whole trouble has been caused by i
the presence here on the racing horizon ]
of the master disturber, Ed Corrigan. In i
the present dilemma, judging from con
versations held with different horsemen,
the California Jockey Club will have the
support of all fair-minded lovers of sport;
and the better class of owners and book
makers. One well-known turfman re
marked yesterday: "I'll give the new
track just thirty days to run and Corri- j
gan will be the whole thing." In Chicago
Corrigan is as unpopular as he is here, |
and he has probably at last reached the j
end of the rope. He was very successful
here last season, but in the far East this j
summer his stable has been a dismal fail- |
ure, costing its owner thousands of dol
i lars. _______________
CITY OF PONCE IS
NEARLY BANKRUPT
Lack of Funds Prevents Carrying
Out of the Sanitary Work, and
Disease Is Feared.
PONCE, Porto Rico, Auf?. 23.â At the
meeting of the City Council to-day It was
suddenly discovered that the city* was
practically out of funds, only 200 pesos
being in the treasury, and that it was
impossible to supply the needs of the
Boarfl of Health.
Governor GeneraJ Davis was asked for
a loan of $10,000 or a gratuity of $5000, but
replied that he had no authority to grant
either request. The Board of Health has
consequently been compelled to stop all
work on the streets to-day. Merchants
refuse to honor orders on the city treas
ury, and the distribution of food an.i
clothing will cease. Lieutenant Henry K.
Eames, president of the board, states that
he had the sanitary situation under con
trol, but that if the work of clearing the
streets were permanently stopped and it
should rain, result would be serious. An
extension of hospital relief Is impossible
owing to lack of funds.
Lieutenant Eames contemplates an ap
peal directly to Governor Roosevelt. Rain
is now setting in here.

Er*c!aJ DiaiMLtcb to The Call.
TACOMA, Aug. 23.â Senators Foster
of Washington and Hansbrough of {
North Dakota are at the head of a '
movement . to bring the Minnesota,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho
and Montana regiments to their respec- i
tive States as complete regiments after
they are mustered out at San Francis
co. These Senators are aided by Sen
ators Davis of Minnesota, McCumber
of North Dakota and Carter of Mon
tana, together with the Northern Pa
cir'.c and Great Northern railways.
When the committees of the several
Northern States started preparations ;
to receive these troops it was found
that the Southern Pacific charged very
h:gh- rates Plans were then laid for
the several â¢ States to combine and se
cure rates for transporting troops from
San Francisco to Puget Sound by j
steamer and thence eastward by rail.
Senator Hansbrough left to-day for
San Francisco to make final arrange- j
meats with the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company for ocean transportation and j
:ilso to welcome the North Dakota regi- i
ment on- its arrival next week. He
spent: two 'days here with Senator Fos
ter perfecting arrangements with the
northern railroads. The North Dakota j
men associated with Senator Hans- >
brough as a reception committee are
Governor Fancher. Senator McCumber, :
Congressman Spaulding and Adjutant
General Miiler.
Senator Hansbrough says: "I am
acting for. Minnesota in the same way
as for my own State. We are raising j
a fund in North Dakota, but the pur- i
pose is not to pay the transportation !
of the regiment, but to give the boys a. j
rousing welcome. It is expected the \
boys will pay their own fares home.
The Southern Pacific has made a re
turning rate which is very high. Now
the plan is to bring the regiments home j
by the most direct route, which is by
water to Puget Sound and then over j
rÂ»ne of â¢ -.- northern roads. In or- j
der to do this It will be necessary to |
secure a through rate by the northern
route equal at least to the Southern Pa- |
cific. This can be done if satisfactory
arrangements can be made with the j
Pacific Coast Steamship Company.
"Of course, the volunteers will have [
to be considered in the matter of the j
route, and everything will depend upon [
what way they decide to return. But j
if the rate is made whereby they can j
return home as cheaply by the north- j
crn route as by the Southern Pacific, no j
trouble is anticipated."

ARMED BANDS MASSING
ON TRANSVAAL BORDER
Mafeking Horse Is Mobilizing and Boers
Have Formed a Laager.
British Subjects in Natal Co-operating With Kruger
in the Preparations to Resist the
Threatened Invasion.
CAPE TCAVN, Aug. 23.â Although the cabled summary of the counter proposals cf the Transvaal Gov
ernment to Great Britain's proposition for a joint commission to Inquire as to what effect the reform franchise
measures would have on the Outlanders is probably incomplete, it undoubtedly gives the general lines accurately.
The Mafeking Horse Regiment is mobilizing rapidly. Several hundred recruits have arrived and been
equipped here and have Joined Vivian's camp. Every train is bringing in fresh recruits. It is rumored that
Â£00 Boers have formed a laager on the border.
From an excellent unofficial source of information it is ascertained that the substance of the Transvaal's
' communication to the British Government in reply to the tetter's demands is a concession of a five years' (ret
' roactive) franchise, a share in the election of the President and an increase in the representation of the gold
' fields, probably eight additional seats, and a stipulation that all other questions are to be submitted to arbitra
â  tionâ but not "to a foreign power: that Great Britain shall not use the recent interference as a precedent and
' that the British Government shall relinquish all suzerainty rights.
PIETERMARITZBURG, Natal, South Africa, Aug. 23.â 1n connection with the rumor that there are many
Bo*rs who are British subjects and outwardly sympathize with the British, while in reality they are secret
agents of President Kruger of the Transvaal republic, the Premier of Natal declared last evening that it was
the intention of the Government to take steps to detect and punish any British subjects co-operating with
the enemies of the Queen.
It is understood that rr.uch secret information has been conveyed to President Kruger and that even ambus
cades have been prepared for the British troops in the event of war by these secret agents.
A force of police has been ordered to Colenze, owing to rumors of the intention of the Boers to destroy the
railroad bridge at that place.
PRETORIA \ug 23 â Conyngham Greene, the British agent and charge d'affaires at Pretoria, to-day pre
sented to the Government a further dispatch fmm the British Secretary of State for the Colonies. Mr. Chamber
lain, the nature of which has n"t yet been divulged. The presumption is that it is connected with the recent pour
car!?'' The members of the executive are apparently more cheerful.
IiOURENZO MARQUES, Delagoa Bay, Aug. 23.â The detained ammunition intended for the Transvaal has
been removed to the Portuguese troopship India." It is reported the Boers contemplate sending commands for the
lug 23â The Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, has received the text of
the r-;. reply I th* proposals of the British Government and now has them under consideration. The
members Of the Cabinet are within reach, but until the Government has determined on what course to pursue, Mr.
Cha" -"- * to divulge the contents of the message from South Africa.
" The Johannesburg correspondent of the Times says: Disquieting reports have been received here from Natal.
It is stated that nesborg was fired upon in Transvaal territory. The feeling near
the border is bitter and the disloyal Natal Dutch are armed with Mausers.
BIRMINGHAM. Eng.. Aug. 23.â A firm of this place has received an order for 14.000.000 Mauser cartridges for
argent delivery to South Africa. - a b-?ing observed as to the exact destination of the cartridges, but it is
said that the 1 â  - Be use Mauser rifles in that territory.
STRIKES A REEF
IN CLEAR WATER
The Gasoline Schooner
Magic a Wreck.
c . . : -. â  w â¢ Tbm Call.
SANTA BARBARA. Aug. 23.â The gaso
line schooner Magic lies in four fathoms
of water in Rancho Vlejo Bay. Santa
Rosa Island, with a large hole in her bot
tom. Yesterday about noon the schooner,
with a cargo of paraphernalia for a craw
fishing camp and several men who were
to be engaged In crawfishing on Santa
Rosa Island, ran into the bay, and In a
Quiet sea with a light lend breeze ran on
a reef. The cook of the party was taking
sounding's at the time, but as he and the
captain had been quarreling', and in fact.
Just before this, they were heard to
threaten to throw one another overboard,
it is believed the right sounding was not
giver., for the bay was so clear and
smooth that the reef could be seen for
some distance under water.
The vessel left this port early Sunday
morning and cruised around Santa Cruz
Island in search of a place to make a
camp, but failed to find one and went
over to Santa Rosa. During the whole
trip the captain quarreled with the men,
and so bitter a fee;" - existed that open
mutiny seemed imminent. Engineer
DuSie said that just before the vessel
struck he heard a threat from either the
cook or the captain to throw the other
one overboard.
When the vessel struck the engineer
was thrown severely upon the floor in the
hold. He Â«oon recovered, and with a com
panion rushed on deck just in time to see
the captain jumping into the skiff with
his valise. The skiff was pushed off and
the engineer called for the party in it to
return and take him end his companion
ashore. In reply son one in the skiff
yelled out: "To h with them; every
man for himself. She's going to turn
turtle," and the skiff and men made for
shore.
Engineer Duffle secured a. gun, and
pointing it at the skiff commanded the
party to return, which they did.
The vessel Bank soon after the skiff
cleared away, but did not turn over, and
now only a few feet of her masts Is
above water.
The men walked over the hilli. a dis
tance of fifteen .-â¢..:â¢ - to the Santa Rosa
ranchbouse, and an island schooner
brought the captain and engineer to the
mainland. The men were hungry and
very much fatigued when the:.- reached a
rarfchhouse. They were well fed and
given dry clothes.
Captain Phil Currin of the schooner
Santa Rosa, which brought the men over,
stated that there was absolutely no ex
cuse for the wrecking of the vessel at
that point, and especially on a quiet day
with the wind wing from the land.
Captain David O'Brien is an old deep-sea
captain and has run out of San Francisco
for many years. He has never been in
these waters and was therefore not fa
maliar with the waters about the channel
Islands. The Mafic was a thirty-ton ves
sel and belonged to the Catalina Con
serving Company.
SAW THE CALL FOR
AN EXTRA SESSION
Captain Milice States Positively That
Both Houses Will Convene in
November.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 23.â The Express
to-day says: A member of the Legisla
ture has been found who will acknowledge
that not only has he seen the much dis
cussed written pledge for a caucus in the
event of an extra session, but also that
he has signed such a document and has
returned it to the promoters of the extra
session idea, whoever they may be.
T. member in question is Captain A. S.
Milice and he represents the Riverside
County district in the Assembly. Captain
Milice is in the city on a short visit. He
arrived yesterday.
â¢â¢I not only believe it. but know posi
tively that an extra session of the Legis
lature will be called." said Captain
Milice when seen by the Express reporter.
"The ostensible reason for reconvening
the two houses will be to amend the
Vrooman act as outlined a few days ago
by the Express. The law needs to be
tinkered up. as in its present shape not
a. city or town in the State can secure
street Improvements under its terms.
â¢â Two caucus calls were sent to me to
sign. The first one I returned without my
approval and gave my reasons for not
attaching my name. The second one I

Captain Milice eaid that the call for
the extra session would be out about

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, THUKSDAY, AUGUST 24, 1899.
COUNTIES CITED
BY EQUALIZERS!
State Board Will Act on
Assessments.
patch 1 - : â¢ Call.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 23.â State
Board of Equalization to-day cited the
following counties to appear on the dates
named and show cause why their assess
ments should not be raised: Butte. Co
lusa, and Glenn. Aucust 29; Santa Clara
and Santa Cruz, August S^ Mendocino
and San Diego, August 31; Alameda and
Sacramento. September 1.
The list as originally adopted Included
San Francisco and Los Angeles, these be
ing included in the original motion to cite,
arid being voted for oy all but Colgan,
who voted against every motion to cite.
After the original list had been adopted
Toland and L. H. Brown trot together and
made a trade. Brown agreeing to vote to
drop Los Angeles if Toland would vote to
drop San Francisco. Colgan co-operated,
a reconsideration was obtained and the
two counties were dropped. As San Fran
cisco showed an increase this year of
$52,0X>,000 over last year, and Los Angeles
shows an increase of J5.000.0C0. there was
no strenuous attempt to retaliate on the
part of members representing other dis
tricts. All the counties which have been
cited show a falling off in their assess
ment rolls, the most considerable falling
off being in the case of Butte County,
whose roll this year Is more- than a half
million short.
NEW CATTLE QUARANTINE
LINE MAPPED OUT
It Will Cress he State Irregu
larly From the Golden
Gate.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 23.â The Governor
j to-day issued a proclamation establishing 1
I a quarantine line against the spread of
Texas or splenetic fever that will.be of
considerable Interest to cattle-men of the
State. The present quarantine line, estab
lished by the Federal Government, follows
the boundary lines of the State, and no
cattle can be shipped out of the State
without undergoing a severe inspection
and disinfection. The line established In
the Governor's proclamation crosses the
i State from the Golden Gate irregularly.
'â¢ The counties of Solano. Sacramento and
i Amadcr and all to the south of these are
in the quarantined district, while all coun
ties to the north of these, together with
Alpine. Mono and Inyo. are taken out of
this district. Of course the line is not yet
effective as against the quarantine put ir.
effect by the Federal Government, which
affects the whole State, but the Governor
and State Veterinarian Blemer feel that
the United States Department of Agricul
ture will adopt the line set forth In the
proclamation and thereby, take the north
crn part of the State out of quarantine.
As most of the stock raised in California
Is raised in the northern part of the State
the good to be pained by the adoption of
the new line is apparent.
The Department of Agriculture has been
communicated with in regard to the mat
ter and an -early favorable r?ply Is ex
pected.

PORTO RICANS MAKE
GOOD SOLDIERS
Experiment of Enlisting Them in the
United States Army Proves
Very Successful.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 23.â According to
recent advices received at the War De
partment, the experiment of enlisting na
tives of the West Indies into the Ameri
can army has proved quite successful In
the case of the Porto Rico Battalion of
United States Volunteers, which body
completed its organization a few weeks
ago. This battalion is commanded by
Major L. P. Davidson and is the only one
of its kind In the army.
Lieutenant Bryand. who is tha battalion
adjutant, has written a letter to Major
Johnson of the Adjutant General's office,
speaking in high terms of the composition
of the battalion. He says that the Porto
Rican soldiers are a fine lot of men, ohe
dlent and willing to learn; they tak* a I
pride in being soldiers of the United
States Army and always drees very clean
and neat. His opinion is that Porto Rican
soldiers, officered by Americans, will be
a success and a valuable addition to the
United States Army.

EXCLUSION
LAW APPLIED
TO MANILA
Chinese Are No Longer
Freely Permitted to Enter
the Philippines.
OTIS TAKES ACTION
Order Made Arbitrarily Unknown
to State Department and Excites
Chinese Government.
Epe<:;al Dlsratch to ThÂ» Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 23.â The State !
Department has been Informed through
a diplomatic channel that General !
Otis has applied the Chinese exclusion |
laws to the Philippines. The Informa
tion was a surprise to the authorities,
both state and military, as the matter
has been under consideration for some
time, and it was not known that Gen
eral Otis had put the exclusion lawa
into force. The first intimation in that
direction came in a dispatch received j
a few days ago from the Chinese Con- i
BC] at Manila, telling the Chinese lega- ]
tion here that the exclusion laws l
against the Chinese had been applied j
to the Philippines. The dispatch was :
brought to the attention of the State ;
Department and inquiry made as to
how the action was brought about, as
the Chinese Government has been so
licitious since American military con
trol was established in the Philippines
that the United States exclusion law
should not be extended over these isl
ands. The State Department knows
nothing of such an extension and made
inquiries of the War Department. The
military authorities, however, were
equally without information as to Gen
eral Otis' course in this particular. A -
cordlngiy the Chinese officials were ad
vised that any action taken by General

Otis in applying the exclusion laws to
the Philippines was not the result of
instructions sent from here, but was
doubtless due to the exercise of hife
authority as Governor-General of the
Philippines. What further â  the
Chinese authorities will take has not
been determined, as Minister Wu Ting
Fang is out of the city for a few days.
There is little doubt, however, that he
will seek to have General Otis' order
held in abeyance until the authorities
here pass upon the general question,
which has been under consideration be
tween the two Governments.
In this connection the State Depart
ment has received an important letter
from Mr. Williams, our former Consul
at Manila, who still remains there in a
confidential capacity. He says the na
tive Filipinos are strongiy opposed to
Chinese labor, and in his opinion the
exclusion of the Chinese from the isl
ands would materially aid in bringing
the war to a close. He places the Chi
nese population at 52,'>J0. which is con
siderably more than other estimates
from official sources. The letter is
dated July 25 and brings the situation
up to recent date. It has been turned
nver to the War Department, to be
used in the genera! consideration of
the exclusion question.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. August 23.â Wheat opened strong
at substantial advances in both December and
September, the latter starting %Â®%c higher
at 74',iQ74%c, and September %c higher at
71;&c. Bull news came in from all directions.
Liverpool showed an advance of %d. The
weather In the Northwest was again wet,
with prospects of a continuance of the rains
ami receipts, compared with those of last sea
son, were conspicuously small. The wet
weather caused a good deal of buying last
week and it had the same effect to-day, as
there was much apprehension of serious dam
age resulting. The opening advance was stub
bornly fought for a time, especially in De
cember, In which option a slight decline took
place soon after the opening, the prices easing
on" to 74f?74 1 / ve. But the news was too much
against the bear side of the market, and be
fore 11 o'clock prices had scored a substantial
advance. September advancing to 72 1 c and
December to 74% c. These prices were above
c.ills and selling against those privileges and
a natural desire to realise profits caused sev
eral soft spots in the market, but no reaction
of note occurred until afternoon. September
in the mantime advanced to 72% c and Decem
ber to 74 : v. A! those prices the demand let
up to some extent and under a moderately
heavy pressure to realize a slow decline took
place, September reacting to 72%@72%c and
December to 74V4<&74%c. The close was steady
at these prices.
Corn did rot display much activity, but was
firm throughout. September closed ltU%c
higher.
Little was done In oats. The market fol
lowed tin 1 late break In wheat and closed
barely steady, with September a shade higher
and December a shade lower.
Provisions were extremely dull. Hog prices
were lower, but there was a fair outside de
mand for pork and ribs, which resulted in
advances in those products. Most of the busi
ness was in the way of changing. At the
close September Pork was 7%' floc higher,
lard unchanged and ribs 5c higher.

Boston Wool Market.
<$ Â»
BOSTON, Aug. 23.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
Although the tone of the wool market Is
somewhat quieter there has been a fair busi
ness in progress during the past week, with
Indications at this writing of an Improved de- ;
mand In the immediate future. A few houses ;
report large sales and those who do not state !
that there has been considerable looking j
around, the result of which has been the tak
ing of quite a number of sample bags, which'
will very likely materialize into considerable
business in the course of the next week or
two. Stocks of foreign goods have been pretty
well worked up, and with a practical cessa
tion of Importations manufacturers have got
the market to themselves better than at any
time since 1892, and at no time since then has
the outlook seemed better. Prices â¢ continue
steady. The pales of the week In Boston
amounted to 4.455.000 pounds domestic and 446,
--000 pounds foreign, making a total of 4,900,000
pounds, against a total of 5,946,000 for the pre
vious week and a total of 2.624,000 for the cor
responding week of last yenr.
Sales since January 1, 1899, amount to 180.
--703,000 pounds, against 77,018,010 pounds last
year at this time. -l_'-"s\ ::

WHEAT- situation seems to be Improv

advices, but the crowd was bearish and short.
Showery weather In the Northwest was re

restricted business. Export houses were all
bullish, and 'â ;<- over September was bid for
export. The Illinois official report figured that
the State raised 7,000,000 bushels under require

Hay and Feed shifts.
Bran and Middlings are firm.
The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"The tracks in the railroad yard are crowded
with cars loaded with Hay and other produce,
and every available schooner on the bay is
busily engaged In transporting crops to mar
ket, and it can now be stated that we are
well Into our regular fall rush of shipments.
"Hay is selling at low figures, and yet we
have seen a much lower range than the pres
ent one. If a greater proportion of poor Hay
was shipped on the market prices, generally
speaking, would be lower, bat as it is the
Hay crop throughout the country seems to be
of genera] good quality. Therefore prices are
maintained nearer a living rate than otherwise
might be expected.
"Alfalfa is coming In very freely, twenty
one schooner loadsâ something over 1000 tons
having arrived during the past^jslx days, and
prices are somewhat weak, $7 per ton being
the top of the market. It Is a noticeable fact
that this year very little Red or Black Tame
Oat Hay is being shipped to market. Last
year a goodly proportion of the crop was of
this particular variety, being shipped more par
ticularly from Sonoma and Napa counties.
This year the bulk of the arrivals seem to be
Wheat Hay, and us many purchased the tame
Oat Hay laM year and were well pleased with
same, they are Inquiring for it this year, and
because of Its comparative scarcity it is In
quite good demand Just now and is selling for
good prices."

WAS DRUGGED
AND ROBBED
OK A TRAIN
A. N. Blashfield Was
No Lunatic.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
S*.is Broadway, Aug. 23.
Arthur X. Blashnold, who "was found
wandering aimlessly about near Sixteenth
street station last night by the police and
was arrested for insanity, was examined
to-day by the Lunacy Commissioners and
was promptly discharged. Instead of be
ing a nt subject for an insane asylum.
B!ashfield is the victim of a base robbery.
According to his statement he was a
passenger on one of the trains of the
Southern Pacinc Company, and arrived in
this city from St. Paul. Minn., last night,
but so far as the trip from Elko to Oak
land is concerned his memory is a perfect
blank. This he attributes to being drug
ged, and while in this condition he was
relieved of $&j and a gold watch.
"Long before we reached Elko," said
B'.ashf.eld to-day, "I fell in with a very
smooth gentleman whom I would Immedi
ately recognize should I see him again.
1 found no objections to an innocent game
for pastime and during the me this
stranger treated me to several drinks
from his bottle. He did not take a smile
himself for he said he had had quite
enough and he cautioned me not to dis
play the bottle, remarking that it was
"nobody's business."
"Suddenly I bec:irne drowsy, but remem
bering that I had cl^se on to $100 in my
pocket I removed the money to another
pocket for better security. After that my
mind became a blank, and bo remained
until I found myself walking aimlessly
about here in Oakland and a policeman
tri=d to sret me to explain myself, but I
was -unable. 1 was drugged and that is ail
there is about It. and my $90 and gold
watch are gone, as is also my hand
sat che!."
Blashrieid is about _â  years of age. He
came to California for the licit purpose
of bettering himself and assisting in set
tling up matters connected with the es
tate of his mother, who died intestate at
St. Paul. Minn., in June of I<?S. His father
<ii*d intestate at Sheridan, Cal.. in ISS7,
and before the â â¢â â .â  had settled up his
estate, including Interests at Sheridan.
Auburn and Gilroy valued at about $15,000,
she. too, passed away without making a
will. â

BOREDOM AND
THE ORPHEUM
ARE STOUTS
BOREDOM bred by a dull play quits
the person after a night at the Or
pheum and leaves not a trace of its |
ate occupancy. Here the hopes of a good i
augb and a sustained interest are seldom
frustrate. This week one has the added i
exhilaration of feeling his life in occa- j
Fiona', danger, but he circumvents the j
rascal who aims chairs and such at him j
by a. duck of the head and emerges from j
the encounter in a jolly good humor, j
They are mighty funny, this Caron and â 
Herbert team of acrobats and neat and j
precise about their work to boot. I fancy ;
they are both equally clever, but spec- j
tacle favors the clown and he lingers in ;
the mind. I wish managers would amend â¢
the custom of billing teams so simply, :
How Is one to tell which is which? One j
might throw choice plums to the wrong
man. Any gleam of light that will slit the !
darkness will be acceptable. Esmeralda,;
the musical wire-walker, upsets our moral ;
training by proving that divided attention
is possible and profitable. She dots two j
things at once and both well. A talkative
if appreciative man. behind me kept my |
hearing at the finest stretch trying to ap- j
preciate some of Gertrude Mansfield's
good work. She sings and dances "My
Hannah Lady" in fine fashion and gives j
promise of becoming an excellent vaude- I
ville artist. If she will but shake oil the
fear of not pleasing she will keep ir.e
covenant rather sooner than she expects.
She ar.d Caryl Wilber have a new sketch
this week ar.d a clever oneâ short, crisp, j
humorous and to the point. If he did
nothing but the bit of pantomime about
the wine he would prove himself an art- '
Ist. I wish he had more to do in his
sketch. Hall and rftaley are the most j
accomplished burglars, one (which is it, j
Hail or Stalky?) is a musician while he
burgles, mho the other is such an idiotic, j
rosy beautiful, bland blocKhead of a I
burglar that as the inevitable man behind
tne said, "he is bully go.jd." "Come on
up/,' he Eays to ihe puliceman; "we're
rubbing a house." j
McMahun anu King a:e specially good j
Ethiopian comedians. Their jokes are not i
to overnarrow but they can be seen j
through Quickly, and their dancing i
catches and holds the wandering eye. i
Freeze brothers won their laurels ;n m\n- (

They "must have a sixth sense called cer- j
petual mutton. Alexander Dagmar, the

TONS OF FRUIT

Oil freight ferry Thoroughfare brought over a train of nine cars, and O
*" I las It was low water there was a steep grade between the deck of the X
5p "^ steamer and the tracks ashore. While the train was being pulled up **
q the incline the coupling of the last car broke and the car started to roll back q
+ and across the boat. Brakemen scrambled to the top. but were unable to +
q check its momentum in time, and the car ran into the bay just as the brake- q

of California. It consists of Dr. W. S.
Betchell, head of the department of bot
any; Dr. William L. Jepson, instructor in
botany, and C. \V. Hunt, instructor in the
department of civil engineering. The three
have spent the entire summer exploring
the northwestern portion of Alaska, to
gether with the Aleutian Islands. Their
purpose has been to carry out a most ex
tended rescearch of the parts hitherto ieft
untouched by scientists, and frcm a letter
received at the University of California
to-day it is learned that they have mot
with "success far exceeding their expecta
tions. They will bring back with them
over one hundred entirely new botanical
specimens, as well as specimens belonging
to other branches of science. It is said
that these will constitute one of the most
interesting contribution* to the scientific
world which has been made for some time.
Dr. Betchell and his party left the Uni
versity of California early last May, soon
after the close of the college term. They
made every preparation for an extended
exploring tour along the region of the
northern coast. Their outfit was carefully
planned for the work of exploring, and a
special feature was made of appliances
for securing and preserving such speci
mens as were likely to be found.
The three explorers made Unalaska their
base of operations. whence they
have undertaken journeys to the regions
surrounding. It was part of their plan
to - end a month or more upon the Aleu
tian Islands, but it is not known yet
whether that scheme was carried out.
A letter from Dr. Setchell to the presi-
Sent of the university reached Berkeley
this afternoon. The letter explained that
the three men would be unable to attend
the opening exercises of the college, ana
asked for a leave of absence of some few
weeks to enable them to complete some

old ferry boat Alameda was placed across
the mouth of the slough close to where
the original sink occurred, wi;h the in
tention of afterward filling in the slough
with mud and rock, and thus solidifying
the roadbed. This time the seat of trouble
shifted itself some distance farther east
and about a mile from the trestle. About
120 feet of the roadbed sank about three
feet. Passengers on the morning train
for Santa Cruz were transferred at the

BALDWIN NOT CONSULTED
IN HOTEL SITE DEAL
Prospective Purchasers Are Doing
Business With the Bank That
Holds the Mortgage.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 23.â When
shown a telegram to-day in which E.
J. Baldwin denied the story that his
late hotel site was about to be sold to
parties who intended to erect thereon
a $3,000,000 hotel. Milo M. Potter, who.
it was announced, is going to furnish
the hotel, laughed as he said: "I scarce
ly know Mr. Baldwin and have had no
dealings with him whatever. The two
men that will build a $3,000,000 hotel in
San Francisco for mo are not dealing
with Mr. Baldwin, but with the bank
that holds the mortgage on the prop
erty. It is probably only a question of
time until that mortgage will be fore
closed, and my men are ready to buy
it in.
"While the Baldwin site is one of the
best in the city for a hotel people need
not think it is the only site, for there
are other places in San Francisco that
are suitable for a fine hotel, such as we
propose to have. The men stand ready
with the money with which to make
the purchase of ground and to erect the
hotel, and I have the money with whi h
to furnish and operate it.
"The new hotel, which will undoubt
edly be built, will be one of the finest on
this coast. It will be like the best ho
tels of New York."

HOW OAKLAND
GOT THE NEWS
OAKLAND, Aug. 23.â Oaklanders ate
dinner late or not at all to-night. Just as
the prandial hour approached the city
was awakened by the loud and prolonged
tooting of scores of whistles. At the same
time hundreds of flags fluttered from as
many mastheads. Suddenly the city took
on a holiday air. From every window
and door within hearing of the whistles
or within sight of the Hags expectant
heads were craning to assure, themselves
that they were not deceived.
Th- â¢;. â  : ; the gallant First Cali
fornia had arrived.
While doubtÃ v. :â â¢ ariFir.gr a flock of b;g
balloons rose swiftly over The Call office,
on liroadway, and as they were wafced
â¢ a.^rward and northward in the perfect
blue sky they could be seen for many
miles. This wan the first intimation thou
-9 had of the arrival of the Sherman.
Then Oakland and surrounding cities
and towns knew but one thingâ the Cali
fornia boys were in sight of the Golden
Gate.
Veterans gathered on the street corners
and retold the stories of Appomattox and
tried to persuade themselves that they
had not lived the la:-- - n and that
they were young againâ y< -"g as the
brave thousand who were yet on the blue
Pacitic. After a little talk they decided
to add to the intensity of the welcome and
issued an order that all members of the
G. A. R. should assemble at Loring Hail
<->n Friday morning at 7:30, so as to take
the & o'clock creek boat to the city and
join in the parade.
Twenty minutes after the news was re
ceived. The Cail office was besieged with
seekers after information and many
thought the transport was in the harbor
ur.d were a little disappointed when they
read the bulletin: "Absolutely no demon
stration of any kind will be made before
to-morrow." In spite of this Information
there was an exodus to San Francisco by
both broad and narrow gauge routes.
S itor Perkins sent the following:
"Will you please ask The fall people m
San Francisco to state that the excursion
steamer Santa Rosa will be at her berth
at Broadway Pier No. 1. at whatever time
the committee names for the other boats?
We want everybody, to know that w<
entirely under the orders of Comrr. I
Spreckels."
EMPLOYMENT
FOR THE BOYS
The employment committee has outlined
a practical plan for accomplishing its pur
pose and securing for the returning sol
diers either their former positions or new
employment.
The committee met yesterday afternoon
at the Union square tent. Rabbi Voor
sanger presided. It was decided to ar
range the muster rolls of the companies
in alphabetical order, and secure through
the assistance of the captains a record
showing the name of the volunteer, form
er employer, age, residence, reference, oc
cupation and company. With this data in
its possession the committee will endeavor
to make a personal appeal to all of the
former employers to reinstate the soldier
boys, and will try also to secure positions
for those who were not employed when
they" enlisted.
C. H. Benedict, W. F. Davis, Charles
Field, A. H. Vail and the chairman were
named as a committee to wait upon
Colonel Duboce and enlist his co-operation
in the work.
Proffered assistance from the Democrat
ic Convention was received with thanks,
but it was thought that political bodies
at this time should not take too prom
inent part in the work, as it would be
tinged with the least suspicion that they
were acting with the object of making
capital.
Much good has already been accom
plished by the committee. Through us
agency positions already await many of
the returning volunteers. Tfljese will be
notified of the good news "immediately
upon their arrival. The Bed Cross boat
will signal to the transport as soon as pos
sible:
"Employment awaits the members of
California"^ First."
Arthur L. Whitney, Robert J. Moore and
Bruce Barry were added to the commit
tee. Rabbi Voorsanger announced that he
would be in attendance at the tent da:iy
from 2 to 3 in the afternoon to attend to
the business of the committee.
I:; connection with the work, A. H. Vail
has received the following letter:
A. H. Vailâ Dear Sir: It la with sincere
gratltuje in nay heart that I pen these lines.
The bright future you opened for my soldier
boy when you Instantly (.after hearing our
story) rlac-d him in a position in your own
splendid store eeeir.s to us like a '.ream. The
Jay before life looked to us blank. Indet-d, for
my hoys health was forever gone. He could
never .ig-airi take his petition in the ''nion
Iron Works, the work being too severe for
him The disease which he contracted during
the battle when Manila was captured placed
him in the hospital many months, and he was
almost in despair, for God has made him my
protector. I am a widow and he my only son.
ben we called on you. having read of your
kindness In the paper, we did not know which
way to turn. I believe God has appointed that
committee of men to help the soldiers â men
who ACT. not talkâ men who will save hun
dred? of irood men from de3peration. For this
will be the case when these poor boys come
home with health and positions Â«one. God
has blessed you. Mr. Vail, and oh. my dear
sir. you richly deserv* It. Thanking you with
all my eoul for what you have done for me and
mine." IDA CUTLAR.

SULLIVAN ORDERED
THE ARCH TORN DOWN
Objected to Decorations That Ob
structed His View Construc
tors at a Heavy Loss.
Frank J. Sullivan, owner of the prop
erty at a 542 and 546 Market street, ap
peared on the street at 1 o'clock this
morning and summarily ordered all work
stopped on the handsome arch the Bald
win Jewelry Company has been hurrying
to completion in front of its cstabiisnment.
Mr. Sullivan claimed that the arch ob
structed the view of others of his ten
ants who occupy the floor above the jew
elry company, and said it must immedi
ately come down. 4
Representatives of the company were
present and a hot discussion ensued be
tween them and their landlord. They
claimed to have had permission from Mr.
Sullivan's agent, from the Fire Commis
sioners and the police, but Mr. Sullivan
waived all permits aside and said that
they had no right to erect an arch or
anything else without his consent. He
ordered workmen to begin at once the
work of destruction, but the man with a
hammer was in no hurry, and at the time
of going to press had taken down not over
a sackfull of evergreens.
The arch was -one of the handsomest
private decorations on the street and cost
the company between SSCW and SSOO. It
was erected with the express permission
of the citizens' committee, which was in
turn empowered to grant such permits
by the Board of Supervisors. The com
pany will fight the attempt to raze their
structure and will appeal to the citizens'
committee to-day for protection against
what they consider Sullivan's arbitrary
and unwarranted action.

MAIL STEAMSHIP
DORIC COLLIDES
WITH HER WHARF
Smashed Forty Feet
of the Structure.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Doric ran amuck at the Mail
dock yesterday afternoon. She struck the
westerly end of the wharf at full speed
and cut into the piles and planking a
distance of forty feet, besides demolishing
one end of the shed.
When the Doric arrived early Tuesday
morning the Mail Company's steamer Az
tec was in her berth, so the Doric had to
anchor in Mission Bay. The Aztec was
discharged yesterday morning and was
moved away from the wharf. At high,
water the Doric was to take her place,
and Pilot "Newt" Jordan was to have
been there to dock her. Captain Smith,
of the Doric was in the country and the
mate was in charge of the vessel. When
high water came and the pilot not aboard,
the mate undertook to dock the ship him
self. The anchor was raised and the big
liner came along for the dock under a
good head of steam. The mate miscal
culated the strength of the win! and tide,
however, and the Doric was carried down
on the wharf.' The engines were reversed,
but before the steamer could gather stern
way she crashed into the wharf and the
damage was done.
Pilot Jordan was standing on the wharf
and saw the whole occurrence. Through
some misunderstanding there was no one
there to take him out to the Doric, and
before a boat could be procured the
steamer was under way. When the big
ship began to head for the wharf there
was a scattering of the clans, and many
of the spectators had narrow escapes-
Customs Inspectors Stevens and Shepman
were standing right where the steamer
struck. They made sure she would back
out again, and had just time to make the
run of their lives before the timbers were
flying in all directions.
There was a shooting scrape on East
street yesterday afternoon, and in conse
quence* William McCready is locked up in
the Harbor Police Station on a charge of
assault to murder. The shooting grew
out of a family row, although McCready
tries to make out that it was a sequel to
the late row in the Firemen's Union.
About seven years ago McCready, who
is a fireman, married a sister of James
ana Thomas Comisky. After a year or so
he deserted his wife, and has never since
contributed to her support. Mrs. Mc-
Cready has had to depend upon her broth
ers arid her aunt, Mrs. Bessingnano, ever
since. In consequence there has been bad
blood between McCready and the Comisky
family. When Mrs. Bessingnano went on
the bonds of Ward and Rogers, charged
with looting the treasury of the Firemen's
Union, McCready tried to have her board
ing-house and the Comisky saloons boy
cotted by the firemen. Lai Saturday he
went Into Tom Comisky's saloon, at 864
Third street, and after some words pulled
a gun and snapped it three times at
Comisky. Sunday he threatened Mr&.
Bessingr.ano with the same pistol, and
yesterday he fired two shots at James
Comisky in his saloon, at 838 Ea?t street.
McCready and Comisky met at th cor
ner of East and Folsom and had a few
words. McCready put his hand on his hip
pocket, and Comisky promptly knocked
him down. McCready half arose and
again attempted to pull his gun. when
Comi?ky knocked htm flat again and tell
on him." A crowd gathered and pulled the
saloonkeeper away. The latter warnÂ« the
people that the fireman had a pistol, and
then made for his saloon. McCready fol
lowed him and took two shots at Comisky.
One of them punctured a beer barrel and
the other went through the wainscoting.
The police then came along and put Mc-
Cready under arrest.
Captain Parsons and the crew of the
steamer State of California made a very
smart rescue on the Columbia River bar
this last trip. The British ship Amphi
trite in tow of the tug Waloola. was pass
ing in and the State of California was
passing out at full speed, bound for San
Francisco. One of the crew of t'#e Am
phitrite was on the forecastle h4aJ get
ting the anchor ready to lower, when he
suddenly fell overboard. In ninety seconds
from the time the man fell into the water
a boat was lowered from the State of Cal
ifornia, but it was too late to rescue the
sailor. . â â >;,"
As soon as the man fell from the fore
castle head three sailors from the Amphi
trite jumped in after him. Life buoys were
also thrown, and one of these the man
caught. He left it. however, to catch ihÂ«
log line of the ship, and was pulled umU r
and never came up again. The three res
cuers from the Amphitrite were picked up
by the .-â .-- toat. but no trace of the
other man was found. After putting <hÂ«
sailors aboard the ship the State's boat
was picked up and the steamer came on
to San Francisco.

of California spoke the tugs Relief and

FENSE AND INSANITY.
The jury in the case of Patrick Keenan
alias Patsy Hogan, who was charged with
the murder of his wife, Anna, returned a
verdict of not guilty in Judge Dunne's
court, about 5 o'clock last evening. The
jurors were out nearly twenty-four hours.
It is evident that they accepted the de
fendant's plea of self-defense as well as
that of Insanity.

to his wife's home, 122 Olive avenue, for
the purpose of seeking a reconciliation,
they having been living apart for many
months. After arriving at the home Kee

house and he went out to purchase some,
returning in about three-quarters of an
hour. After luncheon he and Mrs. KÂ»=

while Keenan was lying on the bed, a
knife protruding from a deep wound in
the region of the heart. Mrs. Keenan
died shortly after reaching the hospital,

a double defense. He claimed that his

EUREKA SOCIETY UNDER FIRE.
Judge Treadwell Has Occasion to
Make Remarks in Regard to
the Curran Case.
John F. Curran. the stevedore who
wears diamonds and patent leather shoes
while his wife and child are going around
in rags, appeared before Judge Dunne
yesterday on a writ of habeas corpus, but
after hearing the argument of counsel.
the Judge remanded Curran back to the
lower court and he appeared before Judge
Treadwell.
Curran. who is what mieht be legiti
mately termed a swell, talked loud and
long to the Judge about the indignity that
had been thrust upon him by being
thrown in jail. He was allowed too much
â v In defending himself and the
Judge finally rose to the occasion.
"It is a bad law," said the Judge,
"which provides that any five persons can
form a society for the suppression of vice.
because any irresponsible person may
form such a society for his own personal
gain as has been shown in this case. Out
of nine cases presented for the considera
tion of this court by the Eureka Society,
all by some crook or turn have failed or
have not been proven. I might instance
the case of the Chinese g'rl recently,
where there was not the slightest evidence
for th* prosecution and I had to dismiss
the case. I also have found that the offi
cers of the society have, as in the pres
ent case, used their influence in favor of
the husband as against the wife and
children. I would suggest that commis
sioners be appointed to look into the work
dons of these s<->ci<>ties."
The Judge granted Curran a new trial
on the ground that the evidence of the
wife was insufficient of itself to convict
and Friday was set to hear corroborative
evidence, Curran meantime to be detained
on $1000 bonds till he paid up $12 50 over
due to his wife, and agreed to pay ti
weekly in future to her.

WANTS A BIG TEE
Van R. Paterson Asks for S 10.000
From the Fair Estate.
Judge Van R. Paterson appeared before
Judge Troutt yesterday and asked to be
granted Jlft.WO from the estate of James
G. Fair as attorney and guardian ad
litem fees for some twenty absent heira
of the estat*>. The application was op
posed by Reuben H. Lloyd and G<- rgre
A Knight. Mr. Lloyd said that Judge
Paterson had already been granted $10,000,
and in his opinion this was sufficient com
pensation for the time being for his labor
in the premises. Knight informed the
court that since the death of Senator Fair
$340 000 had been expended in commissions
and attorneys' fees. Of this amount
Pierson & Mitchell, who represent the
executors, had received $105,000 and Gar
ret McEnerney $52.00). Hence he asked
that no further allowances be made that
the heirs might receive their lawful share.
Judge Troutt took the matter under ad
visement.

and he began to cry and said that he had
left a French loaf instead of the three
square loaves left by the other baker. In

wa<* continued till next Tuesday. It is
said that it is a comman practice for

MR NORTH
COMMITTED A
GRAVE ERROR
Is the Opinion of
Judge de Haven.
MR. OTA WILL BE RELEASED
NOT AN IMMIGRANT. BUT A CIT
IZEN OF THIS STATE.
General Barnes appeared before United
States District Judge de Haver, yesterday
morning with his ciient, S. Ota, a Japa
.Tierchant, member of the arm ji. oca
& Sanada, 151S Polk street. Mr. Ota had
resided in this city for eight years and
had been, doing business hert ail that
time.
He left this city last March and went to
Japan for the purpose of buying a new
stock of goods. His purchases were of
the value of 35060, and he re;
on the Hongkong Mara on the sth
of the present month. United States
Commissioner North prevented him from
landing and regarded him as an alien im
migrant with a chronic disease. Ota,
through Generai Barnes, appealed to the
Secretary of the Treasury.
The merchant was taken off the steamer
by State Quarantine Officer (John and
placed in the pesthoose for a while, and as
soon as he was removed from that insti
tution he was arrested by a jjeputy Immi
gration Commissioner and placed in
charge of the Japanese Steamship Com
pany for deportation to Japan.
General Barnes raised the question yes
terday that Ota was not an alien immi
grant and that therefore the Immigration
Commissioner had no jurisdiction over
him, his client having resided in this city
for eight years and having acquired prop
erty interests here. The mero fact rhat
he had departed on a temporary business
trip did not give the Immigration Com
missioner jurisdiction over him.
Assistant United States Attorney Ban
ning, appearing for Mr. North, contended
that the Immigration Commissioner had
jurisdiction not only of alien immigrants
but also of all aliens.
The cou^-t; ?aid that it was thoroughly
convinced that Ota was not an immigrant
within the meaning of the statute and
that Immigration Commissioner North
had committetf a grave error in law in
refusing htm a landing, but the court wu
in doubt as to its jurisdiction to review
the act of the Commissioner on habeas
corpus, because the petitioner had an ap
peal to the Secretary- of the Treasury- Tat
question as to the jurisdiction of the court
â was thereupon taken under advisement.
Mr. Banning*! argument on that point
was that the court had no jurisdiction to
review the action of the Commissioner.
Ota had appealed to the Secretary of the
Treasury, and in compliance with the law
had submitted himself to restraint volun
tarily, and he therefore had no cause to
plead that he was being illegally deprived
of his liberty.
Judge de Haven remarked that he had
no doubt that the Secretary of the Trpas
ury would allow Ota to land as soon as
the facts of the case were brought to his
attention.
General Barnes complained that the
steamship company had treated his client
Jn a manner which should not be toler
ated in a Christian community. Ota. he
said, had been left without food or a bed
from Friday until Sunday, and wh
partner came to him with some clothing
and prox'isions the things were taken
away from him and he was kicked down
stairs.
An agent of the Japanese Steamship
Company arose in the courtroom an-1 flat
ly denied the statement of General Barnes
An exhibition of bad temper and probably
of violence was averted by Judge de Ha
ven calling the gentlemen to order.

Gentlemen of the Convention: I thank you

your chairman. I ask the support of every
delegate In maintaining order and decorum
throughout our entire deliberations, and on
in 1 art I promise you my earnest efforts to

ness which become one who feels himself to be
th<- presiding officer, not of a majority of the
members, but of the entire convention.
In November there will be held the most Im
portant municipal election which has ever taken
place in this Imperial city of San Francisco. 1
Fay Imperial city, for already the currents of
trade and commerce -which have built up the
stately and powerful cities of the past are com
mencing to flow across the Pacific Into the
rapacious bay upon whose waters will some day
float an ocean tonnage greater than is now
tributary to any city in the .rhi. San Fran
cisco is fortunate in having adopted at the very
opening of this new era a charter which is well
suited to its present needs and will permit a
Bteady progress in the future. It is the -sin
cere desire of all good citizens that this instru
ment should h>- carried out in good faith by
our officials, and that its benefits should be
realized to the fullest extent possible by the
community.

will devote himself unwaveringly to the highest
interests of the city and never be swayed by
his ambition for future preferment.
At last we have the opportunity to secure a
really fine Hoard of Supervisors. We are no
longer restricted to wards, many of them with
small population, but we have the entire city
to choose from. What a chance is thus pre
sented to remove permanently from one Ameri
can city the reproach which too often and too
Justly has been laid upon our municipal coun
cils. There should be no higher honor than
membership in a body which shapes the course
of a large and rapidly growing city of the
United States. The citizen of London Is almost
as proud of a peat in his County Council as
in the House of Commons, and scores of other
European cities are celebrated for the busi
nesslike administration of their municipal af
fairs. Let us avail ourselves of our opportunity
and make our Hoard of Supervisors worth- of
the city in which we live and worthy of
republican institutions, which, in spite of
many disappointments, we yet know to be the
best on earth. .
The Sth of August will lons be remembered
for its successful test of the Stratum nrimary
law and for the election under it so fairly con
ducted that no word of complaint has been
heard even from those who were defeated. It
Is devoutly to be wished that the proceedings
of both party conventions may be such as to
increase still more our appreciation of the new
law. For our part, gentlemen, let us move
steadily forward, with care and deliberation,
firmly resolved to present, as a result of our
tabors the best municipal ticket which hnÂ«
ever been offered to the voters of Kan I-rnn
cisco.
Chairman Kellogg was warmly applaud
ed at frequent Intervals and cheered
wildly when he had finished. C. G. Nagle
of the Thirty-sixth, in an eloquent speeh,
named James A. Wilson for secretary. He
was seconded by John R. Hillman of the
Thirty-fourth, and Mr. "Wilson was as
promptly elected as was Kellogg. Both
RalÃch and T. J. Prendergast, who had
acted as temporary chairman and secre
tary by virtue of holding similar office in
the County Committee, were tendered a
hearty vote of thanks for the efficient
manner in which they had convened the
meeting. _â â¢'â â ; , .
The chair was empowered to appoint
:.ne sergeant at arms and live assistants.
Ho named John J. Dafney for the Urst
position and Charles Duveneck, \V. R.
Xoonan. S. I. Jacobs, John McConley and
11. Toots as assistants.
J. P. Saunders of the Thirty-first moved
that a committee of eighteen members on
permanent organization and order of busl
jess be appointed, and the chair empow
ered to name the members. The motion
was carried, and Judge Schell of i.he
rhlrty-fifth was about to move that a
committee of eighteen members on plat
"orm and resolution be appointed when D.
M. Bolander of the same district moved
hree cheers for the California boys, who
tie said were anchored in the bay. Mat
:ers were very much broken up until the
:heering subsided, and then Judge Schell's
notion was carried.
At this point J. K. C. Hobbs of the
rhirty-fourth moved that the convention
adjourn at the call of the chair, and vith
the same unanimity that had character
ized the rest of the evening's business the
motion was carried.
Chairman Kellogg will probably call a
meeting of the convention next week. At
the next session all the delegates will be
provided with badges.
HUDSON'S WILL CONTESTED
Charlotte K. Clark Charged With
Having Unduly Influenced
Him.
Nathaniel Hudson file<s a contest yester
day to the will of the late George Hud
son, who died April 12 last, leaving an
â state valued at $15,000, the contestant .
alleging that the will was executed under!
undue influence and also that the testator
was of unsound mind. Charlotte K. Clark, j
who claims no kin to the deceased, was ;
named in his will as devisee to the bulk of i
the estate. It is claimed that she secretly
visited the deceased, who at that time i
was 7.". years of age, and through pro
fessions of affection importuned him to
bequeath the major portion of the estate
to her. Hence the contestant prays that

DR. SPONOGLE IS
DISMISSED FROM
AGNEWS ASYLUM
Lunacy Commission
Removes Him.
CONSIDERED UTTERLY UNFIT
DR. J. H. CRANE APPOINTED IN
HIS STEAD.
A Number of Scandals Resurrected
to Bring About the Down
fall of the Superin
tendent.
Dr. F. M. Sponogle, the medical super
intendent of Agnews Insane Asylum, re
ceived a full swing of the political ax
yesterday morning nt a combined meet
ing of the Lunacy Commission and hoard
of managers of Agnews, and his head now
lies in the basket. Dr. J. H. Crane of
Santa Ana, Orange County, was elected
to succeed him soon after the first part
of the political programme was com
pleted.
The meeting was called by the Governor
and ttre place fixed was the Palace Hotel.
Ostensibly the convocation was the se
quel of the adjourned meeting of July 13,
when the Lunacy Commissioners and the
Agnews board of managers investigated
the Chaffers case. The evidence taken on
tho 12th and 1:1 th of July was transcribed
and forwarded to the Governor, who has
promised many of the Agnews positions
to his political friends. Armed with a
typewritten report he attended the meet
ing yesterday morning and gave th>- di
rection to its proceedings. ThÂ»> report
filed with the Investigating commission is
a most peculiar document and shows to
what extent the Governor has gone to
get rid of Sponogle, who is called a moral
leper. There is hardly a crime in the cal
endar which is not charged against
Sponogle in the report filed. Attempt at
Indecent assault, fraud, brutality and
other crimes were recited, and the
displaced physician was pictured as
a monster in human, form. The facts on
which the report was founded were gath
ered from a variety of sources, all of
which tho writer claims is susceptible of
proof. The conclusion of the report is as
follows:
The following is the concluding- portion of
one of the reports to me of a gentleman of
high standing, who was also employed to in
vestigate matters respecting Dr. SponOffle. He
fays: â¢'The career of Dr. Bponogie from the
time he first located in this State or at Vir
ginia City, Nev., to the present can bp traced
by a crooked trail left behind him. Wherever
lur has located he has left evidence of duplic
ity, of hix worthlessnesa as a man, of hi?
venality and of his utter disregard of chastity
and mural decency."
All of the foregoing is reported to me as
EUFC<?ptible of proof.
If in your judgment you think it wise to put
the State to the expense of bringing the wit
nesses here for that purpose. It (-hall be done.
But the evidence at hand demands the im
mediate dismissal of Dr. Sponogle.
If, under the circumstances, you think re
moval of the other two physicians would be
Inexpedient at the present time, that matter
may go over for future consideration.
And in the order of removal which may sub
sequently be entered in regard to Drs. Stock
ing and Cnristal, I would suggest that you
do th.-m the justice to recite that they are not
dismissed on ihÂ» ground that they are lacking
in integrity or morality, but because this in
iquity arose while they were assistant phy
sicians of the Institution, and are by the Board
of Managers held responsible on account or
their lack of information in reference to the
sad condition of this unfortunate woman.
At the meeting yesterday morning there
was a full attendance with the exception
of Isaac rpham. Dr. Curnow was in the
chair, l>ut Mr. Hale of San Jose acted
as spokesman for the board of managers.
l)r. Curnow Inquired of tho commission
what their pleasure was. Mr. Hale arose
and said after a thorough investigation
he and the rest of the board could not
arrive at any conclusion as to the guilt
of I>r. Sponogle, hot having known of all
tin- facts recited in the report. Hale
then moved that the recommendation of
the Governor, the discharge of Sponogle,
be adopted. This was done and in exec
utive session Dr. Crane was appointed to
fill the vacancy. Removal was recom
mended In the case of Stocking and
Christal. but that matter rests with the
new medical superintendent.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 23.â Dr. Julius A.
Crane, appointed by the Governor to suc
ceed Dr. Sponogle as medical superintend
- :â¢ ot Agnews Asylum, is a leading phy
sician of Orange County, of which he lias

diploma from the medical department of
the 'Western Reserve University, Ohio, in
ISO. He lives now and has lived for many
years at Santa Ana, and enjoys a high
standing among people who know him,
and who declare that notwithstanding his
alleged brusqueness <>f manner and blunt
ness of speech, qualities which have di
minished his practice of late years, he
possesses ample ability to fill the office
assigned him. He is between 55 and 60
years old and is a member of both the i
Orange County Medical and Southern j
California societies. His name has not!
hitherto been mentioned for any appoint
ment. He has been active in the politics

FUNERAL OF DR. CORYELL.
A Distinguished Physician and Cali
fornia Pioneer.
The funeral of Dr. J. R. Coryell, who
died on Sunday, took place on Tuesday,
Rev. Mr. Parrish of the Church of the Ad
vent officiating:. A delegation of eight
members of the Society of California
Pioneers acted as pallbearers. After the
solemn services the remains were incin
erated at the Odd Fellows 1 crematory.
John Rittenhouse Coryell was born in
Zanesville, Ohio, in 1522. He was the son
of John and Amy Ann Coryell (born Rit
tenhouse). He was descended on his
father's' side from Revolutionary stock.
They emigrated from Nice, France, dur
ing the religious war and settled in
Pennsylvania. His grandfather was a
bosom friend of George Washington and
was an officer on his staff. On the ma
ternal side he was descended from the
Rittenhouse family of Philadelphia,
which came from Holland and was of
noble ancestry. Dr. Coryell graduated
from the Medical College at Cincinnati,
Ohio and practiced medicine in the State
of Missouri before coming to California.
He was a pioneer, having come to this
State in 1549 by way of the isthmus. He
was elected resident physician of the
State Marine Hospital by Governor Bigler
and besides commanded a large outside
practice. He retired from the practice of
medicine in the year 1563 and devoted his
time principally to mining and land in
terests. In 1865 he married the eldest
daughter of Eusebec Beleau, one of the
oldest and best known pioneers of the
State. The first railroad charter granted
by the State of California was granted to
a corporation of which Lloyd Tevis, Lo- '
renzo Sawyer and the late Dr. Coryell
were the incorporators, and was for a
railroad known as the Santa Clara Valley
Railroad. He controlled large mining and
property interests and was the owner of
the Uncle Sam mine on the Comstock,
which has since been subdivided and is
now known as the Overman and the Sav
age, and one or two others. At one time
he owned, jointly with the late Senator
Hearst 30,000 acres along the water front
of Alameda County, extending from Oak
land to Alviso. He had been at different
times a large property holder in San
' Francisco.
He was an advanced thinker of the
times and several of his mathematical
problems have gone the round of the
great universities both at home and
abroad. His poetical works have won the
admiration of all those under whose no
tice they have , come and some of' his
earliest ventures were published in the
Golden Era, the first paper published in
the State. He was an inventor of much
note and had many patent rights award
ed him. :. â '..-â¢.
Besides a widow, a family of two sons
and two daughters survive him.

ROBBED A STRANGER.
Arrest of Two Bunko Men for Grand
Larceny.
J. C. Relmont, alias McCormack, and
John, alias "Dutchy." Reynolds, well
known bunko men, were arrested last
nipht and charged with grand larceny.
Shortly/ after 7 o'clock Belmont met
Christian Larouette, a recent arrival from
San Jose, and after representing that he
was a capitalist from Sacramento induced j
him to accompany him to a saloon at 102 â 
Geary street. While they were drinking j
Reynolds appeared and proposed that they
shake the dice for the drinks. Belmont
lost, and becoming angry, as Larouette
thought, he offered to shake Reynolds
"for all the money he had."
Failing to influence Larouette to take a
hand in the game, Belmont asked him
to hold the stakes, which amounted to sev
eral dollars. Their innocent victim read
ily consented, and taking out his purse
containing $200 placed the money that had
been bet by the scheming pair in it. Just
then Belmont grabbed the purse and
passed it to Reynolds. The latter quiokly
disappeared, but. determiiu'd to get even.
Larouette seized Belmont by the neck and
hold him until Policeman Collins arrived.
He was then placed under arrest and
taken to the City Prison.
Shortly after he was booked Reynolds,
who had changed his clothing, appeared
at the prison gate and inquired for Bel
mont. Corporal Parrotte at once recog
nized him and informed Policeman Collins
and Detective Dillon, who were in tne j
prison at the time. They promptly went
outside and placed Reynolds under arrest,
much to his chagrin. After he was recog
nized by the victim he was also booked on
a charge of grand larceny.

CALIFORNIANS
IN THE
PHILIPPINE WARS.
<pâ ]r â a HE story of the Californians In
the Philippine wars is one that
\ for the people of the State will
I, ever have an absorbing inter
est. It is the story of adven
ture by field and llood, of triumph of
arms in foreign lands, of daring deeds
and valiant effort in a cause that called
forth the patriotic feeling of every liv
ing being in the State. The boys of
California have well won their spurs.
They have suffered the rigors and ter
rors of war. They have been in the
death-breeding camps <>f the Philippine
jungles. They have been in the
trenches, on the firing line and in the
storm and agony of battle. They have
seen their comrades die by the slow poi
fcon of disease or the quick sharp sting
of the bullet. They are worn with 111â
ness and proud of their triumphs and
now for the first time the story of their
trials and their victories is. in com
pleteness, told.
Few will forget the excitement which
attended the mustering in of the First
California Regiment. The streets were
crowded with enthusiastic men and
women. The martial spirit was in the
air. The brilliant victory of â¢Admiral
Dewey was but a few days old and pat -
riotic ardor had reached a pitch greater
than ever before in the history of the
State. The war with Spain had been
brought to the very doors of Califor
nians and the realization that sons of
the Golden State were to take part in
the real drama of the Southern seas
came in the nature rather of pleasure
than duty. Governor Gage had Issued
his proclamation on April 26. and on
Friday, May t>, 189S, the First Regiment
Infantry, National Guard of California,
was mustered by Captain Carrington
into the service of the United States
and designated as tho First Regiment
California, United States Volunteer In
fantry. From that day in the armory
at Page and Gough streets the First
California was under arms. Its long
series of hardships, suffering and tri
umph for the Stars and Stripes had bo-
Kun.
From the moment of mustering in
there was no delay. Homes were sac
rificed, self-interests were buried, the
citizen had disappeared in the soldier,
and on the very next day. May 7, the
regiment marched from its armory to
establish camp at th- Presidio. [1 had
been a quick transformation, and the
city could hardly realize it. Crowds
thronged tr> the Presidio, where, day
nfter day, the volunteers were learning
the rough life and seven discipline -f
the camp.
There the regiment remained until
Monday, May 23, when the march, from
the Presidio to the transport City of
Inking. b<\?an. The boys of California
were startin? on the long Journey that
was not to end until some had met
death and others the terrible hazard of
eprn^e in war. As the boys marched
from the Presidio to the transport they
were cheered every foot of the way. On
Wednesday afternoon. May 25, the Pe
king leparied. Down the bay she was
escorted by hundreds of gayly adorned
boats. Music and cheers, shouted well
wishes from thousands of friends, the
boom of cannon snd the shrill blasts of
whistles sent the boys from California
on their way. The hill tops of the city
were black with people, and that night
â¦here â ..as sadness in man" homes that
knew for the last time the welcomed
presence of loved ones. War had begun
to have a tragic meaning for Califor
nians.
On Wednesday afternoon at 6 o'clock,
June 1, the Peking entered the pretty
harbor of Honolulu. The people of the
city vied with each other in enthusias
tic greeting. All that demonstrative
fseling could indicate in good .will was
given, and two days after the Califor
nians were banqueted by the citizens of
Honolulu at the executive grounds. At
10 o'clock in the morning on June 4 the
Peking again set sail. No one consid
ered It unusual that the American
cruiser Charleston should accompany
her, but the Charleston had business
on hand and the boys from California .
were soon to know its Import. The fol
lowing day the Charleston signaled to ;
the Peking to stop at the island of
Guam. '
It was not improbable that the Cali
fornians would know something of the :
terrors of war long before the Philip- i
pines were sighted. The Charleston '
was commissioned to seize the La- .
Sronea and the Californians might have I
to fight. On June 20 the Peking and its 1
escort arrived at Guam. The Spanish <
Governor did not even know that ]
Spain was at war with the United i
States. The warning boom of the i
Charleston's guns he thought was a sa- i
lute of courtesy. He Bent out a mes
senger to apologize fur not returnine
the courtesy, and then he knew that
the United States had come to seize the
island. The seizure was bloodless, and
two days after the Peking and her es
cort continued their journey.
The island of Lmzon was sighted at
'â¢lock in the mon
n the
United Stati s cruiser Ila Itimore )

form outpost duty on the Pasay road.
Affairs were becoming critical. Th"
strain was day by day becoming
*.hat t he clash c armies must
soon come and on the night of July 31
th>' summons came. It was the last
earthly call to s":n>- of the volunteers
and it was one that none will forget
Within a very few minutes the sol
â  nia were on the
march. At 1 o'clock in ;h>- morning

the Pasay road they went, the rain

After thai night the Californians saw
active, d- - service. Two 'lays

was sent to the front. On August 13
came the attack on Manila, which th^
Spaniards still held in stubborn posses

Berve. The Californians advanced rap
idly, the First r,v.<} Second Battalions

skirmishers and tl â  Third Battalion in

mation, were floundering through

honors and had proved themselves
worthy of the great State they repre
sented.
For months aft^r the capitulation of
Manila the hoys from California en
joyed a respite. They were housed and
fed well, had opportunities for an.
ment and recreation and were free from
the disease-breeding influences of the
swamp camps. They had perhaps the
best quarters for the American troops
md they were thankful for the conces
sions given. At this time all of the
Californians were together. The First

the Heavy Artillery were comrades,
but it was not to be so for the whole
3f th" Philippine campaign. The War
Department was to send the First Reg
ment in one direction and the batteries
In another and the two were not again
to meet until they did so on the ship
that was to tak>- them both home.

Manila aii'l there tl: â¢ remained until
by the Government's command they

duty of guarding what had been done
and th<- duty was well performed. They
made the old city their headquarters
and were ready, if occasion ever de
manded, to defend the American posi

war dictated, however, that the Cali

actual strife after the fall of .Manila.

Affairs progressed quietly for the
l>,,yp of Callfi -ria during the month of
August. The routine of ramp life was
varied as much as possible, but in Idle
ness came thoughts of home. In Sep
tember these thoughts took tangible
form. The Californians would not let
September 9 pass without a celebration.
Ii was "Admission Pay," ami most of
the First Regiment of California are
Native Sons. So "Admission Day" was
honored as it never was before, thou
sands of miles from California, in a
strange land and among strange peo
ple. Few of those that honored the
day ever thought in th.-ir most vagrant
imagination that some day they would
celebrate the admission of (.'alifnrnh*
Into the American Union within the
walls of old Manila. The exercises took
lilac-? under the direction <>f th*> Native
Sons of the Golden West in the native
Filipino theater.
On October 4 the first regimental pa
rade Of the regiment was given. The
men were robed in white trousers, blue
blouses and white helmets and made a
creditable and striking appearance.
Still true to the traditions i :' home the
First Regim< nt on November IM b
Berved Thanksgiving day, being enter
l by the troops from Minnesota.
Christmas and New Year's day came
and were duly honored. The Spanish
war was over. There seemed then no
indication of strife with the Filipinos.
The Peace Commission was busily at
work and there was nothing to suggest
that affairs in the Philippines would
not be satisfactorily and quickly set
t; ..,!. The Americans and Filipinos
were allies and all was moving smooth
ly. But now and again there was the
expression of an undercurrent of Fili
pino bitterness.
The clash came on February 5. 1599.
The Californians formed part of Gen
eral King"s brigade In the trenches east
of Manila. In front of the American
troops the Filipinos were intrenched
guarding the important road to the
town and arsenal to Santa Ana where
General Rlcarti had established his
headquarters. This position, as readily
understood, was of exceptional Import
ance and was well guarded by the Fili
pino troops. During the night the Fili
pinos had opened fire on the Americans,
carrying deaf with their bullets. The
Americans were forbidden to advance
and were forced to remain in their
trenches as targets of their ' :s.
In th.' morning the word to attack
was given and the Americans needed
no second command. After the bloody
engagement of the morning Santa Ana
had fallen and the fighting Filipinos
were shot to death, drowned or cap
tured. In that battle the Californians
played a distinguished part, as is told
elsHwhere in detail. Scores of oppor
tunities were given for individual acts
of heroism, and they were accepted.
Day aft<T day they were forced to bat
tle, and always emerged from th>'
flict with victory. (>n February 7 the
town <rt Pasig, the last refuse of the
Filipinos, who had fled from Santa Ana,
surrendered to Colonel Duboce. The
entire regiment occupied the town and
waited patiently for developments from
headquarters.
On February 13 the regiment was
withdrawn to the little town of San Pe
dro Macati. On the loth of February
they werp a^iin sent on the march to
clear the insurgents out of the district
adjacent to Manila. This was done
with a will and the regiment only suf
fered In the v. â¢* of five men. After
this campaign the Californians re
turned to San Pedro Macati and re
mained there until the orders came for
the i start frr a new field and i.ew
scenes of war. While the troops were
In this town they were forced to hold
their positions by continuous fighting,
and in this, as in everything else, they
were not found wanting.
On March 1 Colonel Smith, with Ma
jor Sime's Battalion, embarked on the
transport St. Paul for Negroa Island.
On March 21 they were full,) wed by
Lieutenant Colonel Duboce and Cap
tain O'Neill's Battalion on the trans-
I" Tt Indiana. Colonel Smith landed at
Baculod on the northwest coast of the
island, and Lieutenant Colonel Duboce
entered the Island on the southeastern
coast. Shortly after Colonel Smith was
made military Governor of the island,
a dignity which was quickly followed
by his appointment as a brigadier
general. The natives made an attempt
at resistance, but by April 2 they were
conquered and General Smith pro
ceeded to establish a civil government,
for which he was awarded with the ap
pointment of civil Governor of the
island.
On July 1 there was another uprising 1
that possesses significance, because in
the conflict Private W. T. Sweeney was
killed. He was the last of the Cali
fornians to fall and his death cost the
natives 150 lives. There was little more
now for the Californians to do. They
had been the lirst to leave for the war
and the;' were among the very last to
be ordered home. The transport Sher
man stopped at Negros in the middie
of July and the gallant boys of Cali
fornia were soon on board. A stop was
made at Manila i-nd the two batteries
were placed with their comrades in
arm?. The ship set sail on July 26 from
Manila, leaving behind the scenes of
camp and battlefield, trench and firing
line. All that had passed was but a
memory of war and triumph and death.lt^__? =^_s__ _rt-_x

DRIVE THE ENEMY
FROM SANTA ANA.
<T7 X the battle of Santa Ana the Cali
fornians proved themselves worthy
of the highest praise that worthy
of the highest prai â  thai ma; i> i
Jj, given to them. To them do not
belong the exclusive honors of three
days of savage, desperate fighting,
but to them doÂ« belong the tribute of
daring and valor that was not sur
passed in the long campaign in and
around Manila. ThÂ« regulars, I he brave
i â â
r
r soldiers of Idaho, the dashing regi-
I ment of Washington and the Califor-
r nians won the signal triumph that gave
r to the Americans a strategic point of
t great advantage and taught the FII-
r ipinos the grim horrors of war as they
I never learned the lesson before.
r For some time serious trouble had
r been expected from the Filipinos, who
r had taken every means to insult and
r humiliate the American troops. The
r Americans chafed under the abuse of
r the natives, but the most Imperative
r commands had been given to avoid
r trouble at all hazards. At last the
r limit Of endurance was reached. The
r insurgents were strongly intrenched
rin positions facing Genera] King's
r lines. Powerful redoubts, armed with
r masked Krupp guns, had been estab-
r lished. Trench after trench hid insur-
r gent soldiers and protected the ap-
, proaches to Santa Ana. In the little
r city were other fortifications and men
r enough to make them dangerous.
; The key to the entire situation was
'. a road running from Santa Ana to a
r small town known as Paco and thence

â  lines was a stone bridge spanning a
. small stream. It was at this bridge
that some of the most desperate fight
. ing of the war took place. On the morn
ing of February 5, 1599, the conflict be
! gan. At 2:30 o'clock the insurgents
opened fire on the American lines. The
Americans could not get permission to
remove the terrible source that was
senÂ«slng death into their ranks. For
hours they lay in their trenches an-
swering the fire of their foes, when
they could, and seeing twelve of their
gallant comrades killed and many
wounded.
At 8 o'clock In the morning General
Otis gave permission to the frenzied
troops to advance. It was now their
turn, and they accepted it with a feroc-
ity that seemed more than human. They
had a triumph to win and deaths to
avenge. And when their work was
over, when the Californians had swept
the rebel, treacherous host from the
streets of Santa Ana, the Filipinos knew
in terrible seriousness what war and
death mean. ,
The Washington troops were sent to
clear the rice fields south of Santa Ana
and the Californians were commanded
to pour in a cross fire, which they did
with savage energy and terrifying ac-
curacy, at the same time suffering
without flinching the fire of the Krupp
guns of the enemy. It was not long
before the important road into Santa
Ana was an unobstructed highway,
TIIE SAX FRANCISCO CALL.
i The guns of the Insurgents had been
i played upon it in vain. Th >. < "allfor
i nians and their brave fellow volunteers
- could not I)'' dislodged.
Suddenly the command came to take
. the middle redoubt, th_ most dangerous
; of them all, one that as belching
> death from its flaming cannon mouths.
> At the command the Californiana and
i the troops of Idaho bounded forward
* ~~~
with a cheer. Almost simultaneously
with irresistible progress, they sped
forward and leaped over the barrier
of the redoubt. The guns of that forti
fication spoke no more that day. Th
tide of battle had turned and the way
was clear into the very heart of th
enemy.
The Californians dashed into th
streets of Santa Ana, cheering like mad
and driving the fleeing Filipinos be
fore them. The fire of the enemy fro
the windows and verandas of house
seemed to have no effect. Companie
M, F and Kof the First California car
ried the honors of that assault. The
swept everything before them an
added another triumph to the man
that they had already won in thei
brilliant campaign.
But this was not the whole story o
the day. "While these heroes of the
Golden State were making their victo
rious way in the streets of Santa An
Companies A, E and H were renderin
service equally valiant and quite a
daring. Under command they had ex
ecuted a flank movement and had at
tacked the Insurgent left, driving the
broken lines of "Filipinos into the river,
Santa Ana had fallen, but there was
still other work to be done and other
deeds ol heroism to be recorded.
Just as Captain Cunningham, the
commander of Company Kof the First,
was turning foi a new raid he saw a
big casco or barge being poled across
the river. It was weighted with Filipi-
nos fleeing from the doomed city.
In a few minutes a battalion was
lined up on the river bank, and the
Californians opened fire. A single vol
ley was enough, and the white Hag was
raised from the barge. But the Cali
fornians, like all other American sol
diers, had learned to distrust the white
flap: of the Filipinos. It had been raised
too often in treachery to be trusted
now. Under cover of the guns of his
men Captain Cunningham went out to
the barge and took the Filipinos as his
prisoners. He found that the volley
of his men had killed an insurgent cap
tain and four men and had wounded
twenty-six others.
Leaving Company A to watch the
prisoners and guard the southern en
trance to Santa Ana, the other two
companies of Californians took the road
to the south. It was to be a day of
victories. On the way south a strong
force of insurgents was encountered
and routed, leaving its dead upon the
Held. The insurgents had just come
from the village of San Pedro Macatl,
where there were strong breastworks,
and to which tho Filipinos again flea
for safety. But it was a vain hope. The
Californians followed In quick pursuit,
and attacking the enemy from the
front, left and rear drove them from
the village. In that engagement twenty
Filipinos were killed and sixty were
wounded.
But still the irresistible progress of
the Californians was not stayed. The
â ' I
Filipinos were pursued down the road, "*
through Guadaloupe, where there was
sharp lighting in an old convent yard, â
and another triumph for the Americans. â *
On the insurgents sped, and after them *
came the Californians, through the "J
villages of San Perillo and San Nich- *,
olas to Pasid, twelve miles from Ma- -ft
nlla. There the fleeing soldiers of â *
Aguinaldo found a brief interval of "*
rest behind strong works. .
But the rest was not to be of long -ft
duration. The Californians were too "*
insistent, too daring, too impetuous to **
give up after so long and desperate a +
chase. *,
On the next day, February 6, Major *
Sime, with Companies A and C, arrived "*
and the attack began. It was, as the i
others had been, overwhelming and In *Â
the night the insurgents retreated. On -ft
the following day the First California "*
Regiment occupied the town. The reg- "*
iment has well won a tribute, and now J
it is welcomed with the praise which T
it deserves. It had lost some of its *,
bravest on the field and many bore the *,
wounds of battle, but all had won for *,
California a new glory. *,
