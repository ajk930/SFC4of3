MANILA. Sept 3.- Many Spanish !
prisoners are escaping from the j
Filipinos and bringing into the i
American lines stories of hard
treatment: Vhey agree that
the Filipinos are exceedingly short of :
rations and that a large section of their
troops is reduced to the use of home j
made black powder.
The natives ire trying every scheme !
to get foud and munitions from Manila.
Daily arrests are made for attempts to
smuggle contraband of war through the j
American lines. In one case a casco j
m ith a cargo of bamboo poles was over- i
hauled and the poles were found full of
The insurgents have a whoiesome re
spect for the British on account of sev- j
eral threats of British warships to bom
bard their towns unless the rights of ]
British subjects are respected.
Two British vessels, the Liacson and .
the Nero, were driven by stress of .
weather into the harbor of Dagupan, j
the northern terminus of the Dagupan j
railway. The crews were imprisoned, i
but on their protesting that they were |
British subjects, the insurgent auth j
ties permitted one man. Edwards, to ;
come to Manila, promising to release ;
the crew of the Lascon if Edwards ob
tained from the British Consul at Man
ila a statement establishing the na- .
tionality of the crew. A similar con- I
cession was made to the crew of the J
Nero.
Edwards saw several American pris- j
oners who were better fed than the ]
Spaniards or the Filipino soldier. ;
Moreover, they -were not compelled to j
work as the Spanish prisoners are.
A force of native police has begun to ,
patrol the city of Manila, co-operating!
vith the provost guard, whose lack at *
knowledge of the language and the re
sorts of native criminals had given an .
opportunity for burglary, an industry j
which has been flourishing of late. The
new force includes many members of j
the old force and some insurgents who |
had grown tircJ of fighting. It has al- j
ready done much good work in running j
down native criminals.
The American secret service recently ;
found a Filipino spy in Calamba. He j
is supposed to have been the man who \
stole four guns belonging to the Wash- j
ington regiment. He offered desperate ;
resistance to the soldier who was sent j
to capture him and tried to run away :
with two revolver shots in his head. ;
Finally he was brought down by a rifle j
bullet in the hip. He died after jump
ing from the stretcher and trying to j
run.
General Bates, it is expected, will es
tablish posts at Zamboaga and in the
islands of Tamtani. Jolo and Bongao.
Late tliis afternoon the Kansas regi
ment embarked on big barges in the j

OTIS HAS NOT BEEN
ACCUSED OF PERJURY
Frank P. Blair Says the Judges of
Carter Simply Exceeded
Their Province.
CHICAGO, Sept. 3.â The Chronicle to
morrow will say: Publication of the pro
ceedings of the Cap tali Oberlln M. Carter
court martial, whose verdict is In the
hands of President McKlnley for approval
or rejection, has been the cause for a
number of sensational statements during
the pnst week, the wildest of which Is
that of Frank P. Blair, counsel for Cap
ain Carter, has charged General Elwell
5. Otis, now commanding the army in the
Philippines, with perjury and subordina
tion of perjury. In connection with the
statement. Mr. Blair has been quoted as
?mphas!zing the accusations.
"I have made no such charges against
General Otis," said Mr. Blair last night.
"A reading of the affidavit does not. by
;he farthest stretch of Imagination, sup
port such a statement as has appeared
is coming from me. The affidavit was
iled as an essential part of the demand
'or a setting aside of the verdict and sim
ply states that one night at the Desoto
Motel, Savannah, Ga., during the sitting
if the court martial, I overheard Judge
Advocate Colonel Thomas Barr read some
locun to General Otis and Colonel
jillesnie of the court martial, and con
.lude by saying he would read it to coun
sel, and General Otis remarked 'that will
,C good.' The affidavit was a proof that
he two members of the court martial had
'xceeded their province in discussing the
â¢ase with the prosecuting attorney. In
my legal proceeding such an act is suffl
:ient to throw out the verdict of a jury.
tnd the court martial is only a jury.
"I believe Captain Carter is the victim
if a conspiracy to degrade him. It Is an
American parallel to the Dreyfus i case.
["he same general features are in both
â¢ast-s. The accusers and prosecutors of
'arter are of the general staff of the
irmy, as are those of Dreyfus. Jealousy
md a deliberate attempt to carry out the
.vishes of superiors, to pander to political
nfluence. has actuated the majority of
he men on the Carter court martial. Se
cret conferences, such as that set out in
â ny affidavit, were the illegal methods to
: ecure conviction of Captain Carter."
Mr. Blair intimates that Carter was
singled out as a victim of the wrath of
the men who have been promoting the
Nicaragua Canal scheme.
"Carter was named a member of vie
â¢anal commission to Investigate the exact
conditions of the scheme," added Mr.
Blair. "He was selected because of his
<nown engineering ability. At the Army
and Navy Club at Washington, he said
-i* proposed to get at the bottom of the
scheme and show it up. He was then sent
to England as military attache of the
\merican Embassy. On his return he was
placed under arrest charged with de
frauding the Government."

JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 3.â The condition of the republic mind here is decidedly panicky. To-day detectives

LONDON. Sept. 4.â The Cape Town correspondent of the Daily Mail says: "The Transvaal authorities
are forwarding' huge quantities of Mauser ammunition from Pretoria to Bloemfontein. On Friday 1,500,000
rounds arrived at the Orange Free State capital."
The Johannesburg correspondent of the Daily Mail, who paints a gloomy and pitiable picture of the condition
of things there, says: "It is almost a case of absolute exodus and panic. Business is paralyzed, the prices
of foodstuffs are rapidly rising, half the houses are empty and the others are tenanted by people who do not pay rent.
the landlords being glad enough, to have them as occupants in order to insure some sort of protection to the prop

"The tension has reached the snapping point. Bankruptcy and starvation are staring people in the face. An
other fortnight of suspense will result in a complete commercial collapse. The banks are thronged with people anx

"Rumor fixes the number of warrants issued at 147. including the representatives of all the London daily pa
pers. Mr. Moneypenny. editor of the Star, it is reported, has evaded the detectives sent to arrest him and has
succeeded in crossing the border.
"It is believed that the mediation of Mr. Fischer, the representative of the Orange Free State, has failed."
All the special dispatches to the London morning papers from South Africa indicate that the correspondents
have got the impression that the reply erf the Transvaal Gov .*-r snt to Mr; Chamberlain's latest note will be an

The Morning Post publishes the fallowing dispatch from its special correspondent now In Newcastle, Natal:
"I left Johannesburg on ascertaining that it was the intention of the government to arrest everyone who had taken
a leading part in advocating the claims of the Outlanders. There were a hundred warrants out. It was an excit

stores and ammunition ready to start. The Boers declare their intention to rush to the Natal border. The chief of
ficials at Pretoria considerwarunavoidable and have prepared to strike before the British are ready."*
The correspondent of the Daily Telegraph at Pietermaritzburg, capital of Natal, says: "Things have reached
such a pass that war is considered unavoidable and the impression is that the crash will come within a few days."

PERISHES IN
AN ATTEMPT TO
SAVE A BABE
Sanoer Woman Sacrifices Her
Life While Striving to Res
cue Her Child From a
Burning Dwelling.
Fl>eclaJ Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. Sept. 3.â Mrs. Anna Wills
and her infant son Alex Ic-st their lives
in a fire which occurred at Sanger, In
this county, last night. The mother
was seriously injured while trying to
rescue her child and died shortly after
th* flre. The infant was burned to a
crisp and the charred body was not
found until 10 o'clock this morning.
Mrs. Wills was at home alone with
her child last evening. She went out
side for a few minutes, leaving the in
\ fant sleeping in its cradle and a coal
j oil lamp burning in the front room. She j
had not been outside very long when
her attention was attracted by a loud
report and looking around saw her
house in flames. The lamp which had
been left burning in the front room had
exploded, scattering blazing oil in all
directions.
The mother's first thought was to
rescue her child. She rushed back into ]
! the burning building and through the ]
flames toward the room where she had ,
i left the infant sleeping. One step j
through the fire, however, and her
: senses forsook her. She reeled, stag
gered and fell backward through the j
door she had just entered. Her cloth
ing was on flre and her face and hands
were already badly burned. Neighbors
â who had been attracted by the flre
I came to her assistance and rescued her,
I but not until the clothing had been
j burned from her body. She was un
conscious, but revived long enough to
tell the story of the disaster and then
! expired lamenting the fate of her child.
As soon as the building had been re
| duced to ashes a search was begun for
j the remains of the infant. So com
pletely had the child been burned, how
ever, that no trace of the body was dis
covered for nearly twelve hours.
As soon after the catastrophe as pos
', sible an effort was made to communi
j cate the facts to Coroner Long in this i
! city, but the telephone lines were down
and the news of the accident did not
reach Fresno until 5 o'clock this morn-
I ing. Coroner Long then went to
Sanger to hold the inquest over the re
mains of mother and child.
The dead woman was one of the
best-known residents of Sanger and â 
had a wide circle of friends. As nearly
as could be learned the explosion waa
caused by a gust of wind entering ;
through the front door. When Mrs. \
Wills went out she closed the door, but j
i It is thought the latch did not work I
' and that the wind blew It open.

SERVICES in memory of California's ;
soldier dead in the Philippines were
held yesterday afternoon at the Al- !
hambra Theater. Solemn requiems ,
were chanted, panegyrics were pro- ,
nounced on the fallen heroes, tears !
dimmed many eyes and sobs trembled on |
many lips. The audience was a large one. I
and the presence of many dark-robed and
black-veiled figures was eloquent of heart
wounds too recent to have closed under j
the gentle pressure of the hand of time.
The services were simple and solemn, ;
as became the sorrowing of a patriotic
community for its heroic dead. No attempt
had been made at elaborate funeral deco
ration. Here and there a flag draped from
the galleries to recall the soldier; ever ;
and anon a ribbon of crepe fluttered in
sign of his death. A red cross of gera
niums on the stage was emblematic of
the force that had unsuccessfully inter
vened between the stricken heroes and :
their fate, saving some, but not all. For
those fallen It flamed as a signal in that !
sky beyond which they have passed. |
j Eighty-five of them have gone before, j
May they rest In peace.
On the large stage. of thÂ» theater peats
had been provided for the band of . the j
First* CaiJiornia' Regiment..-. , In front â of
-.her; v.cv the .'colors, f*rar*-d, of that rep
inunt ana the Heavy Artillery. Ranged |
; alongside '-were chair? for the members ;
of the I/oring Club an the speakers. In |
the main portion of the. house uniformed j
men from the First Regiment acted as
i ushers. Uniforms of army and navy men i
-, were seen in the boxes. Mrs.- A. S. Town- :
send, who has taken such a loving interest
in the soldiers, was presnt, as was Mayor
Phelan. Mrs. W. B. Harrington. Mrs. John ;
F. Merrill and other ladies of the Red
Cross.
The services opened with Chopin's "Mil- â 
itary Funeral March," by the First Cali
fornia regimental band, and as the sweet '
but mournful music died away Rev.
George C. Adams of the First Congrega
tional Church advanced to the front of !
the stage and in words of simple elo- i
quence asked the blessings of the Al
mighty on the brave soldiers, living and
dead, who had fought so nobly to main
tain the principles of liberty and freedom '
while serving under their country's flag
In a foreign clime.
"Lead, Kindly Light," beautifully ren- :
dered by the Loring Club, followed, and i
then Rev. Dr. Mackenzie delivered a '
touching address, in which, among other !
things, he said:
We are gathered in memory of our
â oldler dead. What that death mear.t
to them as Individual* has already been
considered between them and their brare
and kind-hearted chaplain. Father McKln
non, Wtat that death meant to the faml-
PBICE FI\ r E CENTS.
lies immediately bereaved is to be consider
between them and their pastors. It is for
us In this hour and place to think together
over what their death means to us as a
community, as a country, and. in a meas
ure, as a world.
Now, the story of man from the beginning
is a marchâ progress. Progress does not
came without its cost. Every step upward
and onward costs life, and when a regiment
of volunteer soldiers goes forth to war they
voluntarily forfeit their lives. All that
comes back is clear pain. This is the in
stinct of rÂ»joincing that has voiced itself
along our streets these past days. We re
ceived them as if from the dead. Mothers
laughed through tears with a joy long re
pressed lest It should not come true.
But the price has been paid. Not all have
come back: not all mothers have laughed.
The colonel bring 3 back the living and re
stores them to our homes and industries:
the chaplain brings back the memory of the
dead and commits it to the honor of this
city and of this country-
And we are asked to-day to look upon
the price that we have paidâ costliest
coin of earth; the life blood, not of merce
naries, nor yet of soldiers truÂ«> nor yet of
citizens only, but thÂ» young-, eager, patri
otic missionary blood of our rls.ng genera
tion.
Is it worth the price? Whether it be or
notâ that for which this price has been
paidâ ha? surely been paid, and Is ours;
nor fear, nor selfishness, nor diplomacy, nor
(told, nor argument can induce this great
i -people to Â«ell or to forsake the soil made
bread by this "blood, and njade American by .
these graves. But what a price! -
The legend '<= that no Holland dyke has
succeeded in keeping back the sea unless It
w:s ->unlÂ«'-1 on the sacriuc* of some young
life. History also hoHs it true that pro
gressive step has Leen made which was net
based on some sacrifice of life. The pur
blind Omar has said:
"That never blew so red a rose
As where some buried Caesar bled."
And to-day we s-e gathered nere to think
of these, once living, reposing now In the
dust â to mark the graves of our burled
Caesars.
While the audience was yet absorbed in
the reflections induced by the closing
words of the speaker the sound of music
again floated out from the stage, and the
melodious "Lost Chord," sang by Putnam
GrbnroM, awoke the silent spectators
from their reverie and held them en
tranced until the last notes died away.
"Heroic Homesâ Heroic Armies" was tha
subject of the address delivered by Rev
Dr. F. B. Cherington of Plymouth Church.
He sad in part:
Bet ire a nation can marshal heroic
armies In the field God must marshal heroic
homes within that nation's bou..-arjes.
We are all hoping and praying that the
time of universal peace may soon come,
but It fcas not yet arrived though we
think Its dawn Is flushing the eastern sky.
Meanwhile It Is America's strength and
glory that her homes produce men who
stand four-square to all the winds that
blow. They are ready and able to respond
with fully equipped manhood to any call
of duty, come from what quarter It may.2
POISONING MYSTERY AT
MILL VALLEY DEEPENS
Ebenezer Wormouth, the Alleged Victim, Seek
ing to Shield Those Upon Whom
Suspicion Is Cast.
MILL VALLEY, Sept. The mys
tery of the Wormouth poisoning
case grows deeper as the days
pass and forms almost the sole
community topic of conversation.
"Old Ned" himself veered around to-day,
and to a number of visitors not only de
nied that he had ever been in danger
from an Injudicious administering of
morphine, but bitterly assailed his best
friendsâ the very men who spared neither
time, nor trouble to succor him in the
hour of his distress, and whose action
has made It a dangerous business to drug
him In the future, provided that the al
legations made in such connection are
founded on fact.
Mrs. Levison, the nurse, hart a change
of heart to-day and denied nobody en
trance to the Wormouth house. J. K.
Bnnestell, the San Francisco paper
dealer, to whom Wormouth's property
was consigned a few days prior to the
poisoning, regards himself as the victim
of Innuendo. He stated that his reputa
tion was a sufficient answer to any ques
tions asked regarding his connection with
the apod capitalist nd his affairs.
It is also alleged that all the persons
suffering from Innuendo are the victims
of spite work. Dr. J. J. Spot tiÃ wood, A.
H. Mclnnes, E. Bteele and Thomas Fot
trell being the persons charged with in
stigating the trouble. These men are
prominent citizens whose reputations for
honesty and integrity are unquestioned.
Hamilton Wormouth of Stockton, a
brother of "Old Ned," will be here to
morrow, having sent word to that effect
in answer to the letter of Mr. Steele, in
which he was Informed that his invalid
brother was being drugged and that his
presence here was a necessity.
"Old Ned" is a famous character and
first came Into prominence by his legal
battle with the Gardners. The case now
rests in the United States Supreme Court,
and such is the pertinacity of the aged
capitalist that he has set apart $5000 in
his will to be used in carrying on the
legal war after his death. Two years
ago he was sandbagged and robbed near
his residence, and last summer his house
was tooted of valuables and a consider
able sum of money.
The world Is astounded and perplexed by
cur versatility in turning, without hesita
tion as a people, from the habits and en
terprises of peace to the duties and exi
gencies of war.
The Spanish General Pando reported to
his Government, Just previous t.i the late
conflict, that the United States was
wholly unprepared for war; that the
young men of America were, as
a rule, living in too much com
fort to readily take up the hardships of
camp life, and were too independent in
thought, feeling and habit of life to vol
untarily surrender personal liberty to the
degree necessary for efficient military ser
vice, but when the call to arms was
sounded 265,000 of our young men sprang
to arms with an enthusiasm that aim
the world. He had overlooked the tact that
American home-life so Inculcates civic vir
tues in the germ in the childhood of the
nation that, when the threshold of man
hood is reached, the pulses have acquired
the habit of leaping with high sentiments
and the whole being has become familiar
with the call of duty and all the powers
have been trained to respond with alacrity
to every worthy appeal.
Out from such homes went the young
manhood that constituted our armies; such
homes welcome back the returning ones;
and in such homes that mourn the loss of
sons who came not back, there is sorrow
deep and poignant; yet in it all a profound
sense that the country has its right to the
loyal service of its sons even unto death.
There is heroism in the silent bearing
of this sorrow scarcely less than that dis
played on the battlefield. The heroism of
the battlefield was possible because the
heroism of the home had been first In
stilled into the brave hearts that went forth
to buffer and die. You who were comrades
of the fallen ones saw the pure sold of
their characters revealed by the fiery tests
of experience in camp, on the march, on
the firing line and in the hospitals. You
and these families are knit together In a
common bond of sorrow that is almost
sacred.
Mascagni's "Aye â¢ Maria," exquisitely
rendered by Mrs. Eva T< nney, with a vio
lin obligate by Pietro Marino, followed;
and then Rev. Dr. Voorsanger spoke on
"What the Dead Have to Say to the Liv
ing." He said in part.:
Any one who pays a visit to the battlefield
of Konigsmark. or Sedan, of Gettysburg or
the Plains of Abraham, or any other of the
places where man contended with men, will
pee there -very few evidences ' of the past
strife. Time is a great healer and a great
compensator, and in the neighborhood of
Waterloo, as well as in the other places
mentioned you will find that the energy of
man has repaired the breaches and that
upon the Del : Itself the grass is as green as
before; and while here and there' you may
see mounds that tell of bones resting thÂ«re
you will receive the impression that time,
with its compensating Influence, heals many
wounds, repairs many breaches, dries many
tears â fact, one of the main sources of
human comfort is the divine law of com
pensation that in time reconciles us with a
great deal that seems to be inexplicable
to us.
I dare say that that will be tbe story of;
the Spanish-American war ten years from
now-. We will talk of these dead with some
degree of complacency and with some degree
Of pity, but time Will have healed many
wounds, and in the fields where these men
. suffered there will be witnessed the industry
of man and his capacity to repair the dam
age of a decade ago. There is not much of
a war seen ten years after a battle. It Is
for that reason, fellow citizens, that to-day
. you should inquire somewhat more closely
into the reasons why these men diedâ not so
much from a national standpoint, not bo
. much from a philosophical standpoint, nor
â¢ from the standpoint of the widow who lost
a husband, nor of a mother who lost a son.
These men who died died for something.
They died for a principle.
C, W. Chadwick's "Allah," rendered by
Mr. Grlswold, which came next, was fol
lowed by an address by Professor Thomas
R. Bacon, who spoke of "The Soldier's
Legacy." Briefly, he said,:
In memory of the dead we meet hero
on this day of rest to pay a last tribute
. In" honor of those who went and returned
â  not, and it Is fitting that we should at this
time remember why they went and wÃat
they have done; whether the world is
richer or poorer because of the sacrifice
which they made We look back across
those months since they sprang to the call
to arms with emotion, to see what sent
them forth to lay down their .yes. we
tee the youth of the land full of splendid
promise.. In the Bower "l their young man
hi*)*., go forth to lay down their lives for
the benefit of mankind. No national emo
tion ever stirred mankind as that which
stirred us on to an unaccustomed career
of war. When all allowance is made for
the views of the demagogues and the poli
ticians and their blunders, we must*, still
remember that what moved the nation
und what stirred these young men to such
heroic self-sacrifice was to rescue a miser
able people from the oppression and slav
ery to which they were being subjected.
It wnK for that that these bravo youths
went to the front.
And what did they do? All were ready
to -lay down, their lives, and to some was
that privilege given. A groat price was
paidâ paid out In the lives of our young
eFt and our best. We know they accom
pushed that for which they were sent and
brought to us the doubtful blessing of ex
tensive possessions beyond the seas. But
that is not all. Something more was ac
complished by this sacrifice, something In
spiring to all the people, and we are not
profiting as we should by that sacrifice If
we are not the better therefor. They went
forth to battle for an idea, and they have
left to us an Inheritance in their example
and their spirit which shall be. to us in
coming years something new In our national
life which shall be an added stimulus to
the nation's progress.
The Loring Club then sang "Softly Now
the Light of Day." by Chudwiek.
President David Starr Jordan of Stan
ford spoke of the student soldier. He
spoke of the awakening of the marital
spirit in the universities In '61 and marked
its growth in the Spanish-American war,
when eighty-five men threw aside their
gowns and donned the soldier's uniform.
Forty-two of them were Stanford and one
fell a victim to the war.
The closing address was made by Rev.
Father William D. McKinnon, chaplain
of the First California* Volunteers, who
(poke of "Life and Death in tl\o Philip
pines." He said:
More than sixteen months ago when the
call came for volunteers. it was the Rood
fortune of the First Regiment of California
to be. the first accepted. It was. my good
fortune to be accepted as their chaplain,
and when I received that commission I felt

that repiment. I felt sure that down in
the southern seas they Would give an ac
count of themselves which would add new
glory and new luster to "iir Golden State
and add much to the prestige of that flag,
that country we lo\erl so well.
I see by the trogramme that I am sup

kti"v. what the life in the Philippines is.
Your *ons have written to yon Riving you
plowing descriptions, or sad, as the case
may be. of what their lives were. The
First California Regiment, like all the
i.ther volunteer regiments, went into this
war expecting hardships, expecting diffi
culties and many of them expecting death;
and when these difficulties, these hardships
came not n man was known to flinch, and
you have nc idea ol what those hardships
were at times. I have seen them (lay after
day, night after nieht. in water waist deep
guarding the American lines; I have seen
them night after night sleeping on the
damp cold ground, and not a moment of
that time but bullets were whistllnj around
them. I have seen them lying sick unto
death In our fever hospitals; and in every
trial and hardship they displayed the true
American spirit.
And the hardships we had to encounter
there were much lighter than they would
have been were it not for the kindness with
which *hese good ladies of the Red Cross
assisted and labored to gather funds to
send us comforts and little luxuries for
their boys far. far away. And I cannot
let this ocor 1 ion pass without raising my
voice to thank the good people of my
native State ano the ladies of the Red
Cross that ha\e done so well for these â

Father MeKinn.n spoke of the henefit
that was to be given during the evening
for John W. Slade and called upon his
hearer? to help that sorely wounded mem
her of the regiment, whom he character
ized as one of the most heroic spirits of
tine war. He concluded, dwelling on the
faith that those who died in battle were
in heaven, saying:
Fate and eternity are brought more close
ly around us because our loved ones are
there to pray for us and plead for us; there
to welcome us at no distant day when we
shall grasp their hands in the unbroken
friendship of eternity. Ah, yes, but a
short time ago their large and sympathetic
hearts ceased to heat; their souls fled their
earthly habitations. Beneath the sod under
the southern sky though their bodies rest,
their souls, we trust, are with God.
As the Chaplain took his seat on the
stage the bugle pounded "Taps," and then

SLADE'S BENEFIT NETS
A THOUSAND DOLLARS
The grand testimonial benefit to Private
John W. Slade of the First California
Volunteers,, which, took place in the Al
hambra Theater last night, was an un
qualified success, financially . and artisti
cally. The receipts of the box office footed
up 31151, including $150 paid by Mrs. A. S.
Townsend during the afternoon for one
whole section," which she desired for hÂ£r
soldier guests. In addition to this amount
a considerable sum is expected to be re
alized from the sale of tickets placed with
parties on the outside, tthe returns from
which have not been received. The entire
expenses amounted to considerably less
than $300, and it is expected that the net.
receipts will reach or exceed $1000.
The theater was packed to the doors
the First California Regiment being well
represented, both by officers and privates.
Mrs. Townsend and Miss Rattigan occu
pied a box with Private Siade, the bene
ficiary, and when Father McKinnon, chap
lain of the regiment, who made the pre
sentation address, referred in glowing
words of praise to Mrs. Townsend's grand
and generous treatment of the soldier
boys who claim California for their home,
the entire house arose in . one tre
mendous outburst of applause, greater
even than that which greeted the mention
of the name of the crippled hero for whose
benefit the entertainment was being given.
The programme began promptly at 8
o'clock with a short address by E. R.
Moss of the Pacific Coast Waiters' Union,
under whose auspices - -ie entertainment
was arranged, and from that time until
midnight the actors and actresses who
had generously volunteered their services
for the occasion, followed one another on
the stage in rapid succession. â  Most of the
talent was professional, but not all by any
means. Little Rosie Bennett made the hit
of the evening with her tough song, while
Master. Melville Coakley, Baby Devlne,
Blanche Trelease and Gladys Montague
won rounds of applause and flowers ga
lore by their clever acting and singing.
Professor Topping, the hypnotist, the
Leons in their flying trapeze act and a
dozen others contributed to the evening's
entertainment, which closed with a real
istic tableau by the California volunteers,
representing camp life in the Philippines.
During the evening Father McKinnon an
nounced that he had been requested to
hand Mr. Slade an envelope, which, he
said, contained a notification to the
maimed soldier that the Supervisors had
a position open for him' as soon as his
wounds would permit of its acceptance.
New Play Produced.
CHICAGO. Sept. Xâ Edwin Ard^n's
new romantic play, "Zorah,'" was given
its first presentation at McVJckur's
Theatre to-night under the direction of
Jacob L.IU. The strong situations and
epigrammatic dialogue of the pJay scored
fin immediate success with an audience
which packed the theater. "Zorah"' de
tails a story of love and intrigue in Rus
sia, tho scenes being laid in the Jewish
quarter of Moscow. The plot turns upon
the oppression of a young Jewish rabbi
by the Russian governor of Moscow. The
principal role was played by the author,
Edwin Arden, who received a generous
amount of applause. Edith Wright and
Max Flgman among the others were par
ticularly well received. The staging and

FOR SUBSIDY BILL

Shipping-.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Sept. 3.â
Commissioner of Navigation Chamberlain
finds in the mail subsidies granted to the j
steamship lines by the European coun
tries strong arguments in favor of like
liberal treatment for American shipping.
In a statement which he has prepared on
this subject he says:
The most important contracts at this time
are those of Great Britain, Germany, France,
Italy and Austria-Hungary for mail . serv
ice to the eastern coast of Asia,, China.
Japan, Cochin-China, etc. , Thepe five nations
spend annually $4,000,000 for their mail lines to
the east coast of Asia. Tl<e United States, it
may be added, for Its Asiatic malls in 1597 paid
$13,000 to American steamships and $14,000 to
foreign steamships. This sum of $4,500,000 is
not expended by thofse nations for the exclusive
purpose of sending mails from London, Berlin.
Paris, Marseilles, Vienna, Trieste and Brindisl
in the shortest possible time to Hongkong,
Shanghai, Kiaochau and Yokohama. The time
made by subsidized foreign steamships on this
route is not the shortest practicable by an aver
age of about five days.
The British Peninsular and Oriental line
agrees to carry the mall under its latest con
tract, from Brindlsi. Italy, to Shanghai In 725
hours. The Peninsular and Oriental Brlndlsi
express train, with its Channel connections,
takes the mail from Londan to Brindlsl in
forty-four hours, making the mail time from
London to Shanghai in 780 hours, or thirty-five
days. The best time the company does is lo
cover the distance In thirty-two or thirty-three
days, and its lines are faster than those of any
other on the route. Under its new contract the
North German Lloyd undertakes to carry mail 3
from Berlin to Shanghai In thirty-two days.
Mails are now brought across the Atlantic to
Â»w York in nine days from Berlin, and in
eight days from Paris. Seven days is not a
low limit at the present time for mall steam
ships from Liverpool to New York. Any letter
ought to reach San Francisco from Berlin or
Paris within thirteen and a half days, and let
ters doubtless do cover that distance in shorter
time. The distance from San Francisco to
Shanghai by way of Yokohama Is 570 a nautical
miles.
The establishment of a fortnightly American
service from San Francisco to Shanghai will
bring Berlin and Paris, not to mention British
ports, within twenty-eight or twenty-nine days
of Shanghai, and under favorable but not ex
traordinary conditions within twenty-seven
days, while the best British achievement and
best German promise by subsidized routes Is
now thirty-two days, and the average Is thirty
three or thirty-four.
If quick malls between capitals of Western
Europe and China and Japan were all that was
to be accomplished by the expenditure of
$4,500,000 annually on their steamship lines
time and money could be saved by the developl
ment of. the American route.
â  Whatever may have been the fact In the
recent past, there Is very little substance In
the notion that at present the lar^e subsi
dies to foreign lines to Asia are for the quick
. est transit of malls. There Is -not much more
In the claim that they are, not a necessary

concealing this fact in the reports of the com

creditable about It to conceal.
It will not be discreditable for the United

I will be profitable or not depends on the balance
of value to the country . of the trade to be
acquired and the Investment necessary to ob
tain It.
To the government which makes these for

Increased opportunities for commerce; to ship
owners they are a comfortable addition to the

ASIATIC CHOLERA
APPEARS IN INDIANA
LOT'TSVIIyI>E. Ky., Sept. 3.â Alarming
reports have been received here to the ef
fect that Asiatic cholera has appeared in
Knox and Ohio counties. Ind. It is said
there are several cases of the dread dis
ease at Rising Sun, a small town on the
Ohio River, and the authorities are sup
pressing: the news. The victims havo
every symptom of cholera and the physi
cians arc said to have pronounced the
cases to be that. It Is known here that
the attention of the Health Department
at Indianapolis has been called to the mat
ter and an investigation is being made
The Sta.te Board of Health has prevailed
upon the leading Indiana dailies not to
publish anything about the fact that
cholera is reported to prevail in this
county for the present at least. The
section thus affected, while bordering
upon the river, has no railroad communi
cation, and for this reason the informa
tion has been kept from the public. No
deaths have been reported, but there are
two or three serious cases and local
physicians are using every precaution to
prevent the spread of the dtsease. A
number of families have moved out of
Knox and Ohio counties on account of the
presence of what they believe to be
Asiatic cholera.
GATHERING OF
VETERANS AT
PHILADELPHIA
Thirty-Third Encampment
of the Grand Army Be
gins To-Day.
RANKS ARE THINNED
Remnant of the Northern Forces
Will Be Accorded an Enthu
siastic Welcome.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. B.â The thirty
third annual encampment of the Grand
Army of the Republic will begin to-mor
row. The vanguard of the veterans has
reached the city and found the people
with outstretched hands. Never again,
perh-ipp, will Philadelphia he the scene of
a national encampment of the Grand
Army. Of the valiant men who defended
the cause of the Union there remains but
a remnant, and with the depletion of the
ranks the welcome is more heartfelt and
enthusiastic.
Admiral Sampson with hie fleet of
fighting ships arrived here to-day and this
event marks the beginning of the week s
celebration. The city Is crowded with
strangers, while the incoming trains from
all sections are bringing thousands to
help swell the throng. The city has borne
its share of the work and the citizens of
Philadelphia by contributions of cash and
in welcoming banners have shown their
interest in the reunion.
The route of the veterans' parade,
which takes place on Tuesday, is one
solid blaze of color and light. Not a build
ing but has its front incased in the red,
white and blue. The Avenue of Fame,
which extends from Walnut to Cherry
street en Broad, a distance of five blocks,
with the City Hall as the center, is the
most magnificent piece of decoration ever
attempted in this city. There are two
classes of columns. The larger and more
ornate are about fifty feet in height and
arÂ« placed at the street corners. The
smaller columns, about twenty-five feet
high, stand on each Bide of Broad street,
between the larger columns. The corner
pillars are massive but graceful, and at
the l-i*'- of each are alternately in heroic
siz.- two soldiers and two sailors. Nu
merous circles of electric lights decorate
the piles fmm the base to the gilded
s at the top. The columns are con
ions "f bunting and laurel
and strings of incandescent lamps give
a brilliani eff< ct at night.
The north and smith fronts to the City
Hall will be Illuminated with massive
electric light pieces thirty feet in length
representing the G. a. R. badge.
Camp Sexton, near Bellmont. in Fair
mouth Park, contains 1600 tents. It is
Intended to accommodate those posts of
the Grand Army which prefer to camp
, Out rather than be quartered in halls, ar
! mories or private houses. The tents will
j shelter 10,000 veterans. The big parade
'â¢ Tuesday will be in two divisions. Post No.
' 1 from' RoCkfort, 111., the oldest post in
â¢ the Grand Army, will head the line. As
the vet< rans pass around the City Hall
they will be reviewed by President Mc-
Kinley, who is expected to arrive here
Monday night, accompanied by Secreta
ries Root and Gage and Postmaster Gen
eral Smith. There will be over 42,000 men
in li;.- .
.A feature oi Tuesday's events will be
tile chorus of 3000 school children, who
will occupy a portion of the grand stand
on the north side of the City Hall. As
the parade passes this point the children
will sing patriotic airs.
Of all the military organizations to at
'â  tend the encampment probably none will
! attract more attention than Boyd's girl
cadets of Topeka, Kan. These young la
dies are the daughters of veterans and are
commanded by H. N. Boyd. who was ser
gi ant of Company L, Seventh Illinois
Cavalry during the civil war.
A question of absorbln* interest to G. A.
' R. veterans which will be decided during
; the encampment is the election of a com
mander-in-chiei and other officers. Two
candidates prominent in the iield are Al
bert I>. Shaw of Joe Spratt Post. Water
town, N. V., and Judge Leo Rassiur of St.
Louis. Private James L. Dalsell of Com
pany H, One Hundred and Sixteenth Ohio,
is also a candidate.
The Naval Veterans will enjoy the dis
tinction of giving the lirst street parade
during the encampment. Theirs will take
place to-morrow afternoon, and will be a
unique feature of the demonstration. The
old volunteers who fought under Farragut
will tramp shoulder to shoulder with the
younger veterans of the Spanish-Ameri
can war.
Next Friday the naval parade will take
place. Admiral Sampson's fleet will be
anchored in the Delaware River opposite
the city, and a long line of vessels will
pass around the fighting ships. President.
McKinley and Cabinet officers will review
the warships from the revenue cutter
Gresham. Members of the commission of
the imperial Russian navy stationed here
superintending t he building of a battle
i ship and a cruiser, will participate in the
naval pageant.
Although this was Sunday the entire
day was given to sightseeing by the citi
| zens and visitors. There were three grout
ters of Interest to which people flocked
\ by ten's of thousands. The greatest crowd
was gathered along the Delaware River
front to watch the arrival of the warships.
The North Atlantic squadron, composed
of the flagship New York, cruiser Brook
i lyn, battleship.s Indiana, Massachusetts
and Texas, under command of Rear Ad
miral Sampson, arrived off the center of
the city at 1:30 this afternoon. The fleet,
which anchored at Bombay Hook, about
fifty-miles down the river, las; night.
weighed anchor at 7 o'clock this morning
and proceeded up the river. A reception
committee composed of Mayor Ashbndge,
the local G. A. R. committee and several
city officials, left the League island navy
yard at 9:80 on board the Government tug
Bamoset to meet the squadron. The ships
were off Chester, Pa., and the reception
committee boarded the flagship and for
mally welcomed the admiral to Philadel
! phia!
Neither Admiral Sampson nor any of
the officers of the fleet came ashore to
day. Most of them wil, however, land to
! morrow and take up quarters at the Hotel
! Walton which have been provided by the
reception committee. The admiral will
return Mayor Ashbridge's visit to-morrow
at 1 p. m.
The five big ships that arrfved to-day,
the New York. Brooklyn, Massachusetts.
Indiana and Texas, were built in this
city, and the people evinced the greatest
interest in them, it being their first ap
pearance in these waters since the close
of the war.
From Chester to this city, a distance of
seventeen miles, the fleet was tendered a
continuous ovation. Steam whistles of
factories, locomotives and river craft
made a great noise, to which was added
the cheers of the multitude along both
the Pennsylvania and New Jersey shores.
The squadron presented a magnificent ap
pearance as it steamed slowly up the
, rivtr. The New York led the way with
I the Brooklyn. Indiana. Massachusetts
! and Texas following in the order named.
The flagship dropped anchor off Market
i street and the other vessels swept graee
j fully by with their crews at attention.
They dropped anchor to the north of the
: flagship, forming a single column, and
I will remain in that position until they
sail away the latter part of the week.
The cruiser Detroit arrived several hours
later and anchored south of tho flagship.
j The gunboat Nashville Is expected to
join the squadron to-morrow or Tuesday.
Next in interest to the arrival of the
! fleet was the tented rity at Belmont. in
I Fairmount Park. There are over 1600
tents erected on the slope at that place
and will accommodate over 10.000 veter
ans. The enmp is conducted strictly ac
cording to military rules, reveille and
taps being sounded for the veterans just
as they were In the early sixties. A full
regiment of Sons of Veterans is con
stantly on duty. The camp is only par
tially filled up. but by to-morrow night
I there will be little if any room .eft. With
' the exception of the Centennial In 1876,
i which was held near the site of the camp,
j a larg' r crowd never visited that part of
the great pleasure grounds. From early
morning to late this evening crowds
j wended their way to the big camp.
RENDERED SPEECHLESS
BY EATING AN APPLE
Peculiar Affliction of a Young Girl Puzzles
the Medical Men of Massachusetts.
BOSTON SÂ«pt. 3.-Marie Betancourt. a bright young girl of Taun
ton, accepted the gift of an aprle from an admiring young man with
whom she worked in a cotton mill. She ate it to the core, and enjoyed
the fruit. Within ten minutes she was deprived of the power of speech
and for three weeks, up to a day or two ago, her communication with
her friends and members of the family has been by the means which
are given those who are born dumb, by signs and writing.
The circumstances of the attack of the mysterious malady and of
her recovery from it are exceedingly strange and have attracted won
dering attention from the medical faculty in this part of the State.
Medical men say she has been a victim of the strange disease known
as aphasia which is very uncommon and is extremely rare in persons
of youthful age.
The remedies applied appeared to give no relief and the pain was
at all times very severe, particularly in the right temple. At times her
memory failed her. The physicians agree that the apple was not pois
oned.
Doctors who have looked into the case say the aphasia was the re
sult of the rupture of an artery of the brain.
This is looked upon as one of the most peculiar cases that has come
to the notice of the profession in this vicinity.
Aphasia does not always single out those who comb cotton in the
deafening uprr.-ar of a factory for its victims. The Czar of Russia and
General Butterfleld have recently been afflicted with the dreaded ail
ment.

ON AN ASSASSIN
Canziana's Countrymen
Roused to Action.
WILL EMPLOY A DETECTIVE
POSSIBILITY OF A FALL CAUS
ING DEATH DOUBTED.
Coroner Pierces Statement About the
Broken Neck and Dislocated
Shoulder Ridiculed by
Railway Officials.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 3.â The seeming
apathy manifested by the Sonoma County
authorities as regards any effort to dis
cover the identity of G. Canziant's mur
der* r has so aroused the dead man's
countrymen that they intend to take the
matter into their own hands and secure
the services of a detective agency, with
the object of bringing the assassin to jus
tice. F. Canzlani, brother of the deceased,
has enlisted the sympathy of the whole
Italian colony of Marln County and funds
will be subscribed to aid in the work of
detecting the assassin.
That Canziani was murdered there
seems litttle room for doubt. He was
found a mile south of Howards, lying face
downward across a rail fence, with his
neck brcken and his left shoulder dislo
cated. In the region of the neck and left
collar bone were numerous bruises, one
probably marking the spot where fell the
club or' other instrument thai broke the
man's neck.
The theory that Canziani might have
fallen from the railroad bridge is re
garded as entirely absurd by those fa
miliar with the facts. The body was
found thirty feet from the nearest point
where a man could have fallen, and. be
side, it would not have been in accord
with physical law for a heavy man to
have dropped 137V6 feetâ such being the
height of the structureâ without breaking
a fence rail or being bruised at the point
of contact with the fence. Canziani could
not have been struck by a train, for none
passed in either direction subsequently to
a time when he was seen at Howards.
Coroner Pierces statement that Can
ziani's neck was not broken nor the
shoulder dislocated when the inquest was
held at Occidental is scoffed at both by
I leputy Coroner Steven Eden and the
railway officials. When the body was pent
here for interment the neck was broken
and the left shoulder dislocated, and if
such were not true at the time of the in
quest, only rough treatment in shipping
the remains could have caused such a
condition. As the remains were crated and
carefully handled, the injuries must have
been overlooked at thesinquest.
Coroner Eden telephoned Sheriff Grace
at Santa Rosa and acquainted him with
the facts to-day and Grace said that he
would make an immediate investigation.
The Marin County authorities are power
less, as the tragedy occurred several
ftiles across the boundary line separating
Marin and Sonoma counties.

Explosion of a Steam-Chest Kills the
Wordsworth's Engineer.
NEW YORK, Sept. 3.â The steamer
Caribee arrived from Barbadoes to-day,
with thirty-six of the thirty-nine passen
gers of the Lamport & Holt steamer
Wordsworth, from Rio for New York,
which put into Barbadoes with her en
gines disabled. The head of the low pres
sure steam chest was blown out, instantly
killing Archibald Thomas, the chief engi
neer. The Wordsworth drifted along for
several days until the engineer's depart
ment succeeded in getting steam in the
boilers. The engines were started and
would run for an hour or so at a time,
and then stop only to be again repaired
and started. In this lame manner the
Wordsworth anally arrived at Barbadoes
and transferred her passengers to the
Caribee. Among the passengers was Wil
liam G. Buchanan, United States Minister
to Argentina.

HIGHWAYMEN LOOT
A GAMBLING DEN
Policeman Shot and
May Die.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE, Sept. 3.â At 4 o'clock this
morning Harry Green's gambling rooms
in the heart of this city were entered by
two masked highwaymen, who held up
the fifteen persons present, robbed the
place of 11700 in gold, silver rind bills,
locked the occupants in the room and
dashed down the back stairs and away.
A few minutes later a number of mer
chants and Policeman Richard Gemmrig
attempted to halt the highwaymen sev
eral blocks from the scene of the robbery.
They exchanged shots, each man empty
ing his gun. Gemmrig attempted to close
in on the men when one dre_w a second
gun and fired, the bullet entered Gemra
rig's groin and passed out at his back.
He sank senseless to the ground. Other
officers, who were attracted by the noise,
arrived on the scene and continued the
chase. The robbers, separated and one
who gives his name as Jack Williams was
caught. The other is still at liberty. Wil
liams has been identified as the man who
shot Gemmrig. The captured robber had
in his possession a sack containing $300.
When the robbery took place two faro
games we're running. Fifteen men, in
cluding the emp.oyes of the house, were
present, Both robbers carried guns as
they entered and gave the command,
"Hands up:" The occupants were lined
up in a row facing the wall. One, a
Chinaman, yellea. "No Babe," and tried
to escape. He was knocked unconscious
to the floor by a blow on the head from
one of the robber's guns. While one man
kept the crowd cowed witii his guns the
second gathered all the money in
sight, opened the safe and secured the
bags of gold and the paper forming the
bank-roll. Both the robbers backed out
of the door, which they locked, then dash
ed down the stairs and away.
Several seconds intervened before the
dazed occupants gave the alarm and then
the police took up the work. The fact
that only four patrolmen in the whole
city are on duty at that hour, gave the
highwaymen an advantage and largely
contributed to the escape of the missing
man. The missing robber carries with
him about $1400 in gold and bills. A vig
erous search is being conducted by the
police in the city and all the surrounding
towns have been notified. Green offers
half the money for the capture of the
robber. - ~.'.v
The wounded officer is in a serious con
dition, but the physicians to-night ex
press hopes of his recovery. It is believed
the two highwaymen are the same men
who recently held up and robbed a gamb
ling house at Republic. They have been
rooming here about a week and have been
frequent visitors to the clubrooms.
Williams refuses to make any statement
or to give any clew whioli will lead to
the capture of his partner.
The place where the robbery took place
was less than three blocks from tne puiiee

PACIFIC GROVE. Sept. 3.â Monterey's
annual Mexican fiesta was held to-day, j
There were nearly 4000 people in attend

which were held at the baseball park, and
a very successful programme was car

Some of the best vaqueros of the State,
amor.? them Bush Beever. C. Lugo, E.
Vasquez and Leon Martinez, gave ex
citing exhibitions of their skill In riding j
unbroken broncos and lassoing wild
cattle.
An accident occurred which caused a j
temporary panic and came very near re- j
suiting seriously. A vicious buffalo cow j
that was brought up from the Cooper i
ranch in the Sur district for the sports j
became excited and broke down her pen.
petting into the south end of the arena.
There being nobody in thai portion of
the. grounds the vaqueros soon roped her,
but while taking her back to the pen she S
again got away, this time breaking down ]
the fence that separated the arena from I
the spectators and charging madly into
the crowd of people, vehicles and horses,
causing a stampede. Fortunately no one :
was hurt beyond a few bruises, though
several narrowly escaped serious injury.
The animal then rushed into the street
through another fence and into a back
yard, where she was captured. The
vaqueros had great difficulty in roping
her. and accidentally drawing the lasso
too tight, choked her to death.
While the same animal was passing
Del Monte golf links yesterday she
caught sight of some red golf jackets and
ran furiously at the fence, knocking off
about a dozen caddies who were seated
on it.

INDIANS SEEK TO
PURCHASE ARMS
Timber-Cutting Is Suspended \ and
There Is Much Distress
, Among Workmen.
CITY OF MEXICO. Sept. 3.â Three em
issaries of the hostile Indians in the
southern part of Yucatan have appeared
In town in the British colony of Belize,
pretending to wish to purchase cloth,
but it is believed they are trying to ob
tain arms and ammunition, the sale of
which to Indians is prohibited by the
colonial authorities. The Indians say
they want nothing of the Mexicans and
will not pay taxes on aguadiente and
other products. Many Indians who are
tired of fighting the Mexican troops want
peace and have deserted the hostiles and
dispersed through the Guatemalan prov
ince of Peten. The hostiles have been
re-enforced by large numbers of escaped
prisoners or servants on the- plantations
in Yucatan.
Timber cutting has been suspended on
account of the hostile attitude of the
Santa Cruz Indip-<= and there is much
distress' among men formerly actively
employed in mahogany and precious
woods, and hundreds of Jamaican negroes
are returning home, fearing to stay in
the forests and run the risk of being cap
tured by the Indians, who are fierce and
cruel and given to torturing prisoners.
The Guatemalan Indians distrust the
hostile Mexican Indians and refuse to
receive their refugees in their villages.
If Belize can prevent the smuggling of
arms and ammunition to the Mexican
Indians the revolt will not be kept up
long, but this is the difficulty.

a cattle king of San Antonio. Tex., and
Mrs. B. G. Budd of Riverside. Cal., re
puted to be worth a million in orange
grow and San Francisco real estate,
were married at the Baltimore Hotel this
morning at 9 o'clock. The wedding, al
though quiet, was the occasion for a
greater display of wealth in decorations,
- and gowns than any oth^r Kansas
City wedding, barring the Flood-Fritz af

a SIOOO white tatin gown, with orange
blossom? and a veil, and the groom was
in full dress. The bride and groom left
at once for California, but will return to

TERRITORIAL
GOVERNMENT
FOR HAWAII
I Policy of the President in
Relation to Our New
Dependencies.
CHANGE JT_ MANILA
â¢ Civil Rule by Three Commissioners
to Supplant the Present
System.
Sreelal Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, "WEL
LINGTON" HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
; Sept. 3.â There is good authority
i for the statement that the Pres-
i dent has returned to Washing
: ton with these general ideas uppermost
I in his mind as to his future course in
j relation to new dependencies:
The Phillipinesâ Civil government by
1 three commissioners to supplant the
military rule immediately after the re
â  bellion is crushed.
Cubaâ Continued military control un
' til it is determined by means of general
, election whether the inhabitants want
j independence or annexation. If inde
! pendence the new government elected
. will be recognized by the United States
\ and will be given encouragement and
i every opportunity to establish its sta
bility. If annexation, the President
will be governed by the sentiment of
the American citizens as it may then
exist.
Porto Rico â government of ter
ritorial form, similar to that which pre
j vails in Arizona.
Hawaiiâ Territorial form of govern
', ment as recommended by the Hawaiian
; commission and as provided for in a
I measure now pending in Congress.
Some weeks will elapse before the
! President settles down to the actual
â preparation of his message, but he has
' returned from his vacation with some
! well-denned views as to the difficult
j problems which confront him and will
i immediately commence the discussion
i/f details with the members of his Cab
j met. It has been generally supposed
that with the war in progress in the
; Philippines the President would avoid
: committing himself to recommenda
tions as to the future government of
I the islands, but such will probably not
'be the case. His Pittsburg speech
i leaves no room for doubt that he will
i insist upon permanent American con
trol of the Philippines. To this extent
I he has came out squarely and thrown
< down the gauntlet to anti-expansion
! ists. Mr. McKinley not only favors this
; permanent control, but is prepared
I with all forces at his command to fight
I for it. But to void the charge of mili
j tarism â and that is his reason for mak-
I ing the recommendation he proposes
! outlining the plan to Congress for sub
! stituting a civil form of government for
I the military, the moment peace is ob
! tamed and complete supremacy of the
| United States established.
Future discussion with his Cabinet
1 may change somewhat the President's
I views as to the form of civil govern
i ment best suited to meet the situation
but at present the commission idea pre
dominates. Professor Schurman, Pres
j ident of the Peace Commission, is un
derstood to favor this kind of control
and a historical review recently pre
pared for the President showing that
the United States has frequently adopt
ed this method of control of new terri
tory in a transitory state, has deeply
Impressed the members of the adminis
i tration.
It is appreciated that it will be some
I years before the islands are ripe for
i even a territorial form of government,
j such as is proposed for Porto Rico, so
that the control by commissioners,
much the same as the District of Co
lumbia Is governed, is deemed a happy
substitute for military government and
a safe and simple means of control pre
: liminary to the establishment of a ter
| ritorial form of government when it
may be possible to give the 3 natives,
generally, the right of suffrage.
A plan under consideration contemp-
l ates three commissioners, one an army
officer to have charge of fiscal affairs,
another naval offcer to have control of
customs and a third, a leading Filipino
1 of legal experience to look after the
! judiciary, all three to be appointed by
the President and confirmed by the
Senate. Further details contemplate
giving the Filipinos a voice in all mu
nicipal affairs and the most liberal self
government possible.
YELLOW FEVER STATUS.
Number of Cases in Key West, but of
a Mild Type.
WASHINGTON, Sept ?.â Officials of
the marine hospital service are working
in harmonious co-operation with the
State officials of Florida In dealing with
the yellow fever situation in Key West.
Such information as has been received by
Dr. Wyman. the surgeon general, shows
that there are a number of cases of y*l
low fever there, but mild in type. Dr.
Wyman to-day received from Key West
a list of persons who have left that city
recently, together with the date and man
ner of their departure and their destina
tion. Dr. Wyman says that while there
is no occasion for alarm concerning these
people, ordinary precautions would re
quire that they be kept under observation
for ten days. The War Department
authorities hope to be able to get the
troops away from Key West by Tuesday.
Two telegrams were received by Sur
geon General Wyman to-day from the
Hampton Soldiers' Home, where there
were recently many cases of yellow fever.
Dr. Vickers. in charge, says every' man
at the home has been inspected, and no
infected or suspicious cas^s discovered.
ADAMS STILL MISSING.
The police are deugently endeavoring
to find Kelly, the partner of Casey, the
Australian crook who is locked up In the
City Prison. His reported death in New
Orleans was circulated by Casey and his
friends in order to deceive the officials.
It is known that Chief Lees has received
positive information that Kelly is in the
East and that he is accompanied by an
other crook who came to this city with
the pane. Last night the head of the
Police Department sent a number of dis
patches East asking the authorities to try
and locate Kelly.
Casey was taken from his cell last even
ing and subjected to a rigorous examina
tion He refused to reveal the where
abouts of Kelly, except to say that he
was still alive.
It is expected that Handsome Harry
Adams will be located to-day. He Is sup
posed to be in hiding near this city. In
case he is arrested the police intend to
use him as a witness against Casey.
How to Choose Good Potatoes.
It is not generally Known that heavy
potatoes are usually the best and the
most nutritious, and that the waxy and :
soft kinds are in every way less profit- i
able. An old-fashioned method of test- '
ing the quality of a potato Is to put it '<
into a strong solution of salt; if it is i
; good it will sink to the bottom of the !
' vessel which contains the salt and I
! water, and if the tuber is inferior it will j
float on the surface of the water.â I

DEATH'S CALL COMES
TO J. L ROBINETTE
/â > ACRAMEN'TO. Sept. B.â J. L- Robi-
L nette, one of the leading Odd Fel-
lows of the State and a prominent
v 1 citizen of Sacramento, died this
morning in Auburn, Placer County,
â whither he had had gone for his
health, and his remains were brought to
Sacramento this afternoon.
Deceased at the time of his death was
deputy grand master of the Odd Fellows
of California, and was directly in line for
grand master. He had been in ill-health
for some time, but of late had been con
valescing and hopes were entertained of
his recovery. A few days ago he grew
worse and acting upon the advice of
friends went to Auburn, hoping the air of
the foothills would work a cure. His
death, when it came, was not unexpected.
Deceased, in partnership, with C. H
Harrison, has conducted a printing es
tablishment in this city for many years
and he and Harrison were publishers of
the Odd Fellow.
The funeral will take place at 2 o'clock
to-morrow afternoon from Odd Fellows'
Temple under the auspices of the Odd Fel
lows and a number of the grand officers
will be present.

TO SAVE WATER OF
TUOLUMNE RIVER
Hydrographers Plan a
Storage Reservoir.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA. Sept. 3.â Henry Ramel and
Clyde Seavey have just returned to their j
homes in this city from a three months' I
survey far a storage reservoir in the !
Hetch-Hetchy Valley. The reservoir la
planned by Hydrographers Newell and j
Lappencott of the Department of the In
terior, the indefatigable workers in the
interests of arid land irrigation by the
Government. J. B. Lippencott. resident I
hydrographer for California and Arizona, j
visited the site in person. The surveyors
are enthusiastic over the feasibility of
the scheme, which is simply for the stor
age of the waters of the Tuolumne River.
The Tuolumne. rising in the eastern
mountainous portion of this State, flows
off into the San Joaquin and is lost in
summer. Attempts have been made un
successfully to store its waters for the
dry season. Several years ago the
Modesto and Turlock ditches were built.
They have been fruitful of little be.- â  -
controversy. Here is also the largest
diverting dam in the world. Still the
farmers have been enabled to raise only
grain, etc. There has never been a sufn- I
ciency of water for agriculture on a large i
scale. If the Government follows up its ! â 
project a reservoir thirty by twenty
miles will be built. There is a natural > .
site about 100 miles north of La Grange ,
and twenty miles from Sequoia, the near
est postoffice. It will not be necessary to
make any excavations. All that is nee- '
essary, the surveyors say. is to build a â¢
gigantic diverting dam that will hold the I ,
waters that now now into the San j .
Joaquin. An immense amount of water
flows in the Tuolumne in the winter, but '
in summer the river is? low. The fall is
great, being in one place 127 feet.
The reservoir site is inside the Yosemite '
Park reserve, but is nut a part of the
Yosemite Valley proper. One difficulty '
exists in that the land is owned by pri- |
vate parties who settled previous to the
establishment of the reserve. The Gov
eminent must therefore purchase the
land In order to build the reservoir.
The ranchers, who have large holdings
in the country tributary to the Tuolumne.
are said to look forward with much hope
to the Government's coining to their re
lief. At present there is not water enough
fruit crowing. The towns which are
interested are Modesto. Waterford, Em
pire City, Paradise and Tuoiumne. along
the river If the water is stored it may

INDIAN WAREHOUSES.
They Supply the Bed Man With His
Necessities and Luxuries.
The United States Indian warehouse
was removed this week from State and
Sixteenth streets to 235-247 Johnson street.
This" year about 15,000,000 pounds of
freight will probably be handled by the .
warehouse, us against 10.000,000 pound?
last year. The Indian warehouse is a big
distributing house for supplies for the
Indian schools and agencies operated by
the Government. There are about 500 of
these schools scattered over the face of
the country from Maine to Mexico. Most
of them are. however, in the West. The
institutions are classed as contract, day
and boarding-schools. In the past the
Government has held to the custom of
contracting with the missionaries of cer
tain denominations to operate schools for
the instruction of the Indians, but this
policy apparently has received its doom
and is to be discontinued within a few
years. Meantime the Government is put- ;
"ting up Kb own schoolhouses. and this
means Increased expenditures through the
Indian warehouse.
The variety of articles bought for Poor
Lo as the Indian is usually referred to by
the warehouse authorities, is very larg^
and includes almost everything devised
by the ingenuity of man. from a safety
nin to a steam thrasher. It Is difficult to
associate many of the articles shipped
from the warehouse with the Indian as
he is pictured in the mind of the average
white. To meet the progressive needs of
the copper-colored wards of the nation
the Government made the modest pur
chas last year of 7SOO boxes of shoe polish.
More than 100 eight-day clocks were
shipped from the warehouse to make glad |
the ears of Indian pupils, and 10.000 yards
of elastic were distributed. Whether the
latter will be made into garters or slung
shots is not of record. One thousand dozen
fine combs are furnished to keep the ra
ven locks of the children of nature in
proper condition, and 72.000 safety pins
were forwarded along with the combs and
25 000 pairs of suspenders.
Other small orders executed for Uncle â¢
Sam through his Chicago warehouses, and
tor the benefit of his subjugated wards, ;
are 48 000 linen handkerchiefs. 10.000 yards \
of mosquito netting. 1200 yards of "hair- ;
cloth" for puffed sleeves, several saw
mills 120 sewing machines. 14.400 boxes of
axle grease. 37 lawn mowers. 32 laundry
stoves model cooking tables, kindergarten
"gifts" and schoolbooks and supplies in
startling quantities. No person can pc- i
ruse the list of things shipped from the
warehouse and not be convinced that the

The Barber Was All Bight.
"After being shaved in a Chicago
hotel barber shop," said the man from
South Bend. "I walked out and down
the street and entered another shop and
took a chair. The barber lathered and
scraped me without a word, and fifteen
minutes later I submitted myself to a
third. He lathered and rubbed as if I
had not been shaved for a month, and
just as he took up the razor I asked:
"Didn't you notice that I had been,
shaved twice this morning?"
'â¢ 'Yes. sir. he replied."
"But you are going to shave me
again." .
" 'No. sir. I suppose you came in here
to get the skin taken off and part with
some of your cheek." 'âPhiladelphia

AIRSHIP MOMS
TO THE PINNACLE OF
A CHURCH STEEPLE
EVANSVTLLE. Ind.. Sept. 3.â A
farmer who invented an airship
several months ago gave an exhi
bition of his invention at the Spen
cer County Fair, at Chrisney. yes
terday afternon, and ended up on
top of a church steeple. The farm
er's invention is a cigar-shaped
balloon, to which a basket is at
tached. There is a four-bladed pro
peller on each side of the basket.
These propellers are worked by or
dinary bicycle pedals.
The management of the Chrisney
fair secured the farmer's machine
as the chief attraction, with the
understanding that he was to give
an exhibition each day, and on the
last day was to sail from Lhrisney
to this city, a distance of forty
miles. Fifteen hundred people were
at the fair yesterday, and as this
was the last day the fanner made
arrangements to carry out his con
tract. He inflated his machine with
gas, had the airship cut loose from
the guy ropes at 3 o'clock and one
minute later he was sailing around
over the fair grounds. He let his
machine rise to a height of 100 feet
or more before he began to work
the pedals. Everything worked
well, and cheer after cheer arose
as the peculiar looking machine be
gan to circle around. T^.e inventor
started his ship in the direction of
Evansville. The pedals became
disarranged and a strong wind
blew against the machine, which
began to fall. The inventor in vain
tried to stop the fall, and soon the
machine struck a church steeple
and hung there, like Baron Mun
chausen's horse. The balloon col
lapsed, but the farmer clung to the
steeple until a ladder was secured,
when he reached the ground in
safety. Aside from a few bruises
he was not hurt.

THE FACTORY AND THE FARM
"TâHE farm and the factory are not exactly hand
in hand at present. The-former is lagging some
* what, while the latter is advancing with great
strides. It is not that the farm is not prospering, but
the factory ng. The industries, which were
regarded with an askant eye by the New York bank
s' in the current year, have more than re
deemed the promises made then, and are enjoying a
of prosperity never before seen. Manufac
tured articles are continually rising in price, while of
kite the tendency in some of the more important farm
products has been rather downward than otherwise,
i .wing exclusively to the abundance of the crops.
Some lines, such as fruit and wool, are active at
good prices, but cereals have lately been weak. Raw
Lotton. too. has weakened off, owing to rain in the
South, though the condition of the Texas crop is
still far from satisfactory. These are about the only
exceptions to the almost general record of the lively
markets.
Iron and steel, of course, lead all other products
in activity and strength, and the demand for them con
tinues unabated. Foreign countries are ordering
American locomotives and bridges, while the domestic
demand is simply immense, a good part of the pro-
ductive capacity of the country for the first half of
jyoo being already engaged. It was thought, several
months ago, that there would be a halt in this de
mand, but it is as excited as ever. Add to this the
continued firmness in hardwood lumber, and it will
readily be seen that everything made out of iron and
wood is likely to be high from now on.
Cotton and woolen fabrics scored another advance
in August under a brisk call for goods. Hides and
leather and boots and shoes arc reported selling
quickly at firm prices, though keen competition in the
two latter descriptions keeps the margin of . profit
down to a narrow limit. Reports of an expected ces
sation of hemp shipments from the Philippines has
advanced the prices of rope and other hempen prod
ucts. Lumber retains its former activity and firm
ness. In fact, the industrial situation is in excep
tionally fine fettle, employment being general and
strikes few and unimportant.
The country's bank clearings continue to show a
gain over iX->X. though the increase has been less prn
r.ounced of late. Last week it was T3.9 per cent,

a decrease. Failures were the smallest for a long
time, being only 131. against 164 for the same week
last year.
Locally there is no halt. The export business of
San Francisco is still so active that everybody is
grumbling over the lack of vessels. The hay mer
chants have large orders for the Hawaiian Islands
which cannot be filled through want of freight room
on the vessels engaged in the island trade, and this is
but one of many instances. The local cattle market
is still distinguished by high, prices for all meats, and
the importation of nineteen cars of hogs from Ari
zona the other day produced no effect whatever on
the market. The fruit glut is over, and prices for can
ning fruit have bounded back to their previous high
level, while dried fruits and raisins are feeling the
effect of a steady demand for the East and abroad.
As for canned fruit, most of this season's output was
sold months ago. Wool and hops are selling at good
;-rices. and only the cheapness of hay and grain de
tracts from the general prosperity of the farmer. As
for merchandise, the local merchants are doing a
larger wholesale business than for years, and every
few days an advance in something or other is an
nounced. It is the best year in general trade that we
have had since 180.2.
English newspapers have repeatedly asked why the
farmers in the colonies prefer implements of American
lo those of British manufacture. The answer from
the antipodes is because the United States makes the

Dr. Pardee of Oakland has a firm conviction that
the sole purpose of the existence of the State Board

A HAPPY LABOR DAY.
LABOR day should this year be celebrated with
more than usual merriment and gratification. It
has been a prosperous year for America. The
workingmen of all trades and of nearly all sections of
the Union have been rewarded with more abundant
: earnings than for many a year past, and. moreover,
all prospects of the future are bright and promising.
The establishment of an annual holiday for the pur
pose of providing a special festival for workingmen
| and for consideration by the thoughtful of the dignity
| of labor and the rightful honor due to those who en
| gage in it, is in itself an evidence of the growing
| power and influence of workingmen in the social
i structure of civilization. The celebrations of the
; people are not to be confined to the commemoration
of military virtues anc victories only, but are here
after to be accorded to mark also the public esteem
I for the strong sons of toil who build up a nation and
i establish its independence and it? prosperity upon a
j firmer foundation than can be laid by any war how
: ever triumphant and glorious.
The workingmen of the United States are now
i winning victories which have become the marvels of
the industrial and commercial world. The products
: of their skill and labor are finding markets in every
part of the globe and are bringing to the republic
an annual increase in wealth far vaster than was ever
extorted by the greatest conqueror in history from
' unwilling subjects. So long as our workingmen are
: furnishing not only the products of mechanical skill
i but machinery itself to the world at large, supplying
: locomotives for Russia, electrical apparatus for Great
Rritain. mill machinery to Germany, iron bridges for
the Soudan and for India, agricultural implements
for South America and Australia and mining ma
chinery for South Africa, we need not tax ourselves
to provide for commercial expansion at the cost of
war.
Our best and most profitable victories in the past
have been along lines of industrial development, and
i we have only to go forward on that same ascending
pathway to attain all the grandeur a true patriot can
de-ire. The American workingman has served his
country well in every emergency. He has been evfr
ready to lay aside the tools of his trade for the
I weapons of war when it became necessary, and many
and renowned are the victories attained as much by
his indomitable valor as by the skill of the generals
: who commanded, but after all his most useful as well
: as his noblest service has been in what he has ac
complished by labor to improve the conditions of so
ciety and make the ways of life better for those who
are to come after him.
Assessor Dalton of Alameda says that everybody
considers it necessary to try to rob the Government
; He might at least have had the courtesy to admit
that some people do not live in his county.
Commander Taussig of the gunboat Bennington
thought he knew more about running the fleet at Ma
nila than Admiral Watson, and said so. He has been
ordered home to think it over.
THE PARCELS POST SYSTEM
BY a convention agreed upon between Post
master General Smith and a special German
envoy, Dr. Munira yon Schwarzenstein, there
will be put into operation between the United States
and Germany on October i a postal service by means
of which articles of merchandise may be exchanged
by mail between the two countries, provided they are
put up in packages which do not exceed eleven
pounds in weight. The postage rate for parcels going
f<-om the United States to Germany is fixed at i->
cent- for each pound or fraction of a pound. The
rate in Germany on parcels for the United States is
fixed at 2 marks 40 pfennigs a parcel, whatever its
weight, but a reduced rate of 1 mark 60 pfennigs may
be adopted for a parcel not exceeding in weight one
kilogram, equivalent to two pounds three ounces.
There has been in operation for some time a par
cels post system between the United States and sev
eral countries in Central and South America and
with the West India islands, but the new convention
extends the system for the first time to a European
country. It is not improbable similar arrangements
with other nations in Europe will rapidly follow, for
the need of a general parcels post system with the
great commercial countries of the globe has long been
felt and repeated efforts have been made to accom
plish it.
The opposition to such an international system for
the transmission of small parcels has come almost
wholly from our own country. The Germans proposed
such an arrangement as far back as 1885. and France,
Great Britain and other nations have made similar
proposals, but until the convention now agreed upon
with Germany was effected nothing came of them ex
cept diplomatic negotiations. The objection on the
part of our Government was largely due to the hos
tility of American express companies and to the fear
that the interchange of merchandise by post would
be more to the advantage of Europe than of our own
people. We have now. however., built up so large an
export trade to Europe in articles of all kinds it will
be of advantage to our merchants and manufac
turers to be able to send samples of goods to Euro
pean dealers at a small expense, and hence the estab
lishment of an international post has been urged of
late with considerable force in all of our large cities.
It is a foregone conclusion the extension of the
parcels post to Europe will be followed by a demand
for the introduction of the system within the limits
of our own country. If a package weighing eleven
pounds can be sent through the mails from San
Francisco to Berlin why not from San Francisco to
Stockton? The requirements for such a system in
foreign trade are as nothing in comparison with the
needs of domestic trade.
â¢It is true such a system of transmitting small
parcels would to some extent cut into the business of
express companies, but when the Government estab
lished the postal money order office it to an equal ex
tent interfered with the business of bankers. The re
sults of the money order system, however, have proved
wholly satisfactory. They have been beneficial to
the public and have not injured the bankers enough
to close up a single banking institution. It can hardly
be doubted the results of a cheap parcels post would
be of a similar nature. There is no reason why we
should deprive ourselves of a great public conven
ience simply out of deference to express companies.
The issue is one that cannot be avoided, and it is safe
to say the convention for a parcels post between this
country and Germany will eventually lead to the es
tablishment of the system throughout the Union.
MECHANICS' INSTITUTE FAIR
NOT to be outdone by any other body of men in
this year of big tilings, the directors of the Me
chanics' Institute have provided at the Institute
| Fair an industrial exhibit of far more than ordinary
attractiveness and value, and, like the State Fair at
Sacramento, it will prove a record-breaker in the way
of such expositions.
A striking feature of the exhibit is that made of the
i Philippines, and it will be noted as not only a novelty
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1899.
for sight-seers but as a timely illustration of a form
of Oriental civilization which is of political and com
mercial interest to us at this time.
Notwithstanding the attractiveness of the foreign
display, however, the main value and interest in the
fair is in the showing it makes of California industries
and the evidence it affords of an increasing variety
and excellence of the work. The one point of indus
trial development in which we lag is that of manu
facturing. Our rural industries are carried on with
a higher degree of skill and with better results than
those of any other State in the Union, but we are still
lsrge exporters of raw material and importers of
manufactured goods, many of which are made of the
very material sent out of the State to be manufac
tured. Every exhibition, therefore, which tends to
stimulate interest in California' factories and to in
crease the popular demand for home goods is of
more than ordinary benefit.
Throughout the whole Union the year has been
one of such prosperity that a larger degree o,f suc
cess than usual in enterprises of any kind is not sur
prising. Improvements are to be seen on all sides
and are no longer matters of much comment. Never
theless, the Mechanics' Institute has accomplished
what will be regarded as a marked success even in
this prosperous year, and the exhibits will well repay
not only sight-seeing, but careful study.
THE Presidential commission appointed to pre
pare a code and government for Porto Rico has
made its report. The system proposed permits
no elections, and prohibits to the people the right of
voting or selection of any of the officers set over
them, and gives them no voice whatever in the gov
ernment set up to 'rule them. They are denied the
right of trial by jury except in felonies and civil cases
involving more than $500. The President of the
United States is to appoint a Governor General. In
the county, township and city government provided
the higher officers are to be appointed by the Presi
dent, and the others by the Governor General, and
these in their turn appoint the lesser officers. Eng
lish only is to be taught in the schools, for which it
is provided that only American teachers shall be em
ployed, and is to be the official language.
The commission recommends that the system be
installed at once by "Presidential decree" in order to
forestall Congressional action. The reason given for
this extraordinary recommendation is that if Congress
enact laws for Porto Rico the status of the island
would be changed and it would become "a part of the
constitutional territory of the United States."
It is recommended that Congress empower the
President to make tariffs between this country and
Porto Rico and vote to him a fund to be used in con
verting the island currency into its equivalent in our
money, which is to be substituted for it.
The report will be a surprise to Americans. Here
tofore it has been argued that Congress can govern
territory of the United States without regard to the
requirements of the constitution. This commission
goes a long leap beyond that and proposes to fix the
status of Porto Rico as no part of United States ter
ritory at all, in order to bar Congress from legisla
tion concerning it. Its government is to be by "de
cree" of the President, who is the source of all
patronage and controls the appointment originally, or
through his appointees, of every officer and school
teacher in an amorphous and anonymous political
community, whose people have not even a whisper in
the direction of their own affairs.
This authority of the President is not to be under
the control of Congress at all, nor is it found in the
constitution under which he is elected to his office.
His '"decree" is the equivalent of the ukase of the
Czar and the firman of the Sultan. For the exer
cise of this power he is not responsible to any body.
For its abuse he cannot be impeached. Congress can
not call upon him to account for any act in Porto
Rico. There he is an absolute monarch, an autocrat,
less accountable than the Czar.
The proposed plan is more than a surprise. The
country has been educated in the belief that Con
gress would govern our newly acquired territory. The
accompanying qualification that it would not look to
the constitution for its power to do so was at first
disquieting, but this feeling passed away in the re
flection that Congress would be accountable to the
people. To snub Congress utterly is a proposition
so novel as to be monstrous. The commission was
appointed by the President, and no doubt has re
flected his will and obeyed his instructions. The re
port means that the same system will be applied to
the Philippines, and that the constitutional President
of the republic will be the irresponsible ruler of twelve
of fifteen millions of people, voiceless and voteless in
their own affairs, with their government carried on
and justice administered in a language with which they
are not familiar, and with no appeal to any power on
earth beyond their irresponsible ruler.
It has been often announced during the last year
that our authorities at Washington were studying the
British colonial system and Were being tutored therein
at the British legation. Perhaps it would have been
better to study our own system of constitutional and
responsible government.
A COMMERCIAL MUSEUM.
T~N HILADELPHIA by the establishment of a
L ) comprehensive commercial museum accom
* plished one of the most notable successes of her
history. Hardly any enterprise undertaken by an
American city of late years has been more extensively
commented upon or has proved more useful. At the
present time merchants and manufacturers of even
such great cities as New York and Chicago go to
Philadelphia to acquire at the museum the informa
tion they need in extending their trade with foreign
countries.
San Francisco has an opportunity of achieving on
this coast a repetition of the success attained by
Philadelphia on the Atlantic side of the continent.
It can be accomplished without anything like the ex
penditure of time and of money required for the up
building of the museum in the Eastern city, for San
Francisco will be able to profit both directly and in
directly by what has been done in the original enter
prise.
It is announced that the directors of the Phila
delphia museum will gladly co-operate with our own
people in establishing here a branch of the enter
prise, and from out of the large stores of exhibits in
that city would furnish enough to start a museum
here. The proposition, it is pleasing to note, has
been taken up by the Merchants' Association and a
special committee appointed to consider ways and
means for carrying it out. The movement is, there
fore, in good hands, and if a general support be given
we shall probably have before long as one of the at
tractive and instructive features of the city a com
mercial museum second only to that of Philadelphia
The value of such a museum can hardly be over
rated. That much has been proved by the use made
of the exhibits in Philadelphia. San Francisco, as the
American metropolis of the Pacific Ocean, ought to
have a commercial museum of the trade of that ocean,
and it is to be hoped it will be provided promptly.
THE PORTO RICO CODE.
MINING ENGINEERS.
BOOMS IN OIL FIELDS.
FINDS IN THE HILLS.
A marked degree of interest, is being
shown In the mining counties and by ac
tive mining men in San Francisco in the
coming annual meeting of the American
Institute of Mining Engineers which be
gins in this city on the 25th mat. and lasts
three days. The preparations for it and
for the liberal entertainment of the
guests are engaging much of the time of
E. H. Benjamin, secretary of the Califor
nia Miners' Association, and other mcm
i bors of the executive and reception com
; mittees, the latter of which has Vice
| President W. C. Ralston for its chairman.
The prospects of the meeting and the
present status of the preparations for let
ting these distinguished mining men know
more of California's mineral greatness
axe reviewed as follows by Secretary
| Benjamin, who represents the secretary
j of the institute, Rossiter W. Raymond of
i New York, in arranging the programme
I at this end:
"The last advices 1 received from Secre
tary Raymond as to the number of the
members of the institute who would make
the trip, were a month ago and at that
time 178 had written that they would at
tend," says Mr. Benjamin. "The number
will undoubtedly be larger and the mem
bers in California and the rest of the im
mediate coast region will increase the
membership attending the meeting and
the trips about tiie State. There will be
also quite a number of ladies and otner
friends of the members who will come
along. The total membership of the insti
tute includes 2344 active, 172 associate, 37
foreign and 11 uonorary members. It in
cludes the most distinguished scientific
workers in the mining field and represents
the best ability and character in the pro
fession of mining engineering, which is
enabling the industry to make such rapid
strides in these days. At the meetng it
self there will be the usual number of im
portant technical papers and discussions
and then several clays will be given to
seeing as much as possible of the Cali
fornia mining Held from north to south.
"The people of the mining counties to
be visited are appreciating the importance
of those visits and are showing a keen
Interest in them. 1 am constantly receiv
ing inquiries as to the exact time when
the party will arrive in their localities,
how much time will be given them, how
many there will be and so on. The county
miners' associations, Boards of Super
visors and other leading citizen's are ready
and anxious to extend true minors' hospi
tality to the Visitors, to show them what
mining is and may he in thoir regions
and to help make the California meeting
the most int-erestlng one the institute has
held. At many places the party will be
feasted and driven about to leading mines
and other places of interest and several
counties are getting up special local min
ing exhibits and preparing special pam
phlets on their mining resources for the
benefit of the visitors. Shasta. Trinity
and Siskiyou counties will probably have
a Joint display ready at Redding. One is
being got together at Oroville. and others
are planned in some of the mother lode
counties to be visited.
"1 would like to see one impression cor
rectedâand that is that those people are
coming here to buy mints and that there
will be a chance fi>r promoters to float
mining schemes, bir and little. A few
peopie have that idea, . ut they are com
ing on a pleasure trip and for the pro
fessional benefits of the annual meeting.
We want to show them as much as pos
sible of our mines and mining possibili
ties, but we don't want them bored by
promoters.
"The Eastern members will come by
way of Chicago and tho Northern route
in a special train of from seven to ten
cars, which will be met at Montague,
near the State line, by the reception com
mittee on Saturday, the 2:! d. at noon.
Sunday will be spent at Kedding until 11
p m. a visit in the meantime being made
to the smelters of the Mountain Copper
Company at Keswick.
"San Francisco will be reached at S:ls
a. m. of Monday, the 25th. They will go
to the Palace Hotel, which will be the
headquarters of the reception committee
of tho California Min>rs' Association,
which will provide handsome decorations
and which may be trust. -d t<> look well
after the comforts and pleasures of the
guests here The sessions of the meeting
will be held on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday In the Marble room of the
Palace, ending at noon of Wednesday.
There will be no excursions to interfere
with the sessions, but any who wish to
may see the points of interest in and
about the city during this time.
"In the afternoon of the 27th the sight
seeing trips will begin witti a visit to the
College of Mines of the State University
and then a run by special train to the
Selby Smelting Works up the bay shore.
In the evening there will be a banquet. at
the Palace.
"On the 28th the special train will leave
Third and Townscnd streets at S:?0 a. m.
Stanford University and the Palo Alto
stock farm will t*e seen and the Vendome
at San Jose reached for luncheon about
noon. At 2 p. m. the party will start in
carriages for the Lick Observatory, a spe
cial night there being reserved. San Jose
will be reached again that night.
"For Friday, the 29th, two alternate ex-^
cursions are arranged. There will be one
to the New Almaden quicksilver mines
and one to Del Monte, returning that
evening. At 10:30 p. m. the whole party
will leave for Col fax, Placer County, By
way of Niles.
"On the 30th Colfax will be reached at
7:30 a. m. and from there a special train
on the narrow-gauge will take the party
to Grass Valley and Nevada City, where
Saturday and Sunday will be spent as
guests of the citizens and where the im
portant mines will be visited.
"On October 2 Dutc , Flat will be reached
via Colfax and the Polar Star hydraulic
mine visited. Auburn will he reached at
noon and a luncheon provided by the peo
ple enjoyed. Sacramento will be visited
that afternoon and then the train will
start for Orovllle, which will be reached
during the night.
"October 3 will be spent in and about
Orovllle and the gold dredges will be in
spected.
"lone will be reached next forenoon and
from there conveyances will be taken for
Sutter Creek, Amador County. That and
the next day. October 6. will be spent In
seeing the deep mines of the mother lode
about Sutter Creek and Jackson, such as
the Kennedy, Argonaut, Oneida and the
rest, and on to Valley Springs, the ter
minus of the narrow-gauge road, which
will be reached late on the sth, and from
where the party will go to Jamestown via
Lodi.
"Two days will be spent seeing the Tuol
umne County mines and other attractions
in the region about Jamestown and So
nora. When Valley Springs Is reached
those who wish to see more of the mother
lode may take conveyances and go by
road across Calaveras County, through
San Andreas, Angels Camp and Robin
sons Ferry. People of Calaveras County
are anxious to take a party that way and
a number will probably go, joining the
rest of the party at Jamestown.
"Leaving Jamestown Saturday evening,
October 7, the party will divide. Those
who wish may enjoy a four days' trip to
the Yosemite. The others will see the
raisin vineyards about Fresno on Sunday
and they will see them right in the
harvest season.
"October 9 the Coalinga oil fields will be
briefly visited and then the train will start
for Southern California.
"On October 10 the oil field at Santa
Paula, Ventura County, will be seen and
then the Oxnard sugar refinery, the
Snmmerland oil field and oanta Barbara.
Leaving Santa Barbara at 4 p. m., Los
Angeles will be reached at S p. m.
"Santa Monica will be visited on Wed
nesday, the 11th.
"On the 12th Pasadena and Mount
Lowe will be seen and in the evening the
Yosemite party will arrive at Los An.
geles and the home trip will be begun.
"This tour of the State will give the
\ visitors a delightful experience and a gen
eral understanding of the extent of its
i mineral resources. They will be able to
learn a good deal of the mineral regions
not visited in various wayp. They will
have one source of general information in
a book of nearly 500 pages descriptive of
the California mining industry, which the
association is preparing as a souvenr of
the meeting. It will contan valuable arti
cles by able mining authorities, reviews
of the mineral resources of the most im
portant mining counties and over a hun
dred Illustrations, and it will be hand
somely printed and bound. A copy will
be sent to every member of the institute.
"This visit will nut California In elOMr
touch with these people, some of whom
bare been here before, but most of whom ;
have only read about the State's mining
industry. They cannot fail to receive
good impressions which will be of much
benefit to the industry here. They are
not, as a rule, investors in mines them- :
selves, but they advise and direct capital
and while there may be no immediate re
turns easily seen it will result in the at
tention of more capital bring drawn to
this field. They will learn that California
is not even half prospected yet, especially
In regard to minerals other than goM.
We have vast quantities of economic min
erals undeveloped and unprospected and
this is especially true of. copper.
"The possible benefits are not to bÂ»
judged by the numbers who come. It will
not be a miscellaneous gathering (if peo
ple of diverse interests, but of men in
telligently and keenly interested in one
industry. The few agricultural experts,
who recently studied the State, will indl
rectly bring greater benefits than a large
fraternal convention. There are many
ways in which this meeting will result
in good to the State. There will be a good
deal written about California mining here
and elsewhere. Here in California par
ticular attention will be directed to the
mining field and our mining opportunities
and the importance of the industry to the
State will be advertise.! at home as they
need to be. Those mining communities
that stir themselves to welcome the visi
tors and set forth their mining resources
are better off for their display of enter
prise and energy and the advertising they
accomplish will spread a Long ways be
yond the circle it is directly intended for.
"The coming of the institute was due
to the efforts of the executive committee
of the California Miners' Association and
this may be noted as a small item of evi
dence of the value of the association and
of the fact which many do not appreciate,
that it does not confine its interest and
efforts to any special part of the mining
field, hut broadly represents the interests
of the whole industry and does all It can
for it. With a membership of over 9000
of the mining population of the State It
is of course the proper host of those who
come at its invitation and it is finding
everywhere a very cordial co-operation In
its plans to extend true California hospi
tality to the distinguished guests."
The oil Industry booms right ahead, and
this year will see a great increase in the
State's petroleum product. In the Coal
inga field no new wells are reported pro
ducing, but the few producers at Oil City
are yielding from 400 to 1000 barrels a day,
and about 60,000 barrels a month are be
ing shipped. Five new derricks were in
process of erection near Oil City last
week. The California Oil Exchange is n*>\v
ready for business in the Stock Exchange
building in Pine street, and its formation
has already sent up the stocks of several
companies. In the Ran Joaquin VaUey the
excitement is as keen as ever, and the
Incorporation of companies, some to pros
pect for oil and some to sell stock, is as
active as ever.
The boom is large in Southern Califor
nia, stimulated by the big advance in
prices. Of Los Angeles prices the Times
says: "On the Los Angeles market prices
during the past week have remained firm
at $1 ' ! " a barrel f. o. b. cars, and from
$1 15 to ?1 23 in the field. Holders still look
forward to seeing prices go to $1 50 f. o. b.
cars, but they add that at those figures
it will remain stationary, and that noth
ing higher need be expected."
In the Los Angeles lit Id attention cen
ters in the prospecting of what is belived
to be a western extension of the field. Oil
producers are rapidly securing lands in
the supposed extension, near Hoover
street, between First and Sixth streets,
and the Los Angeles product may be
again increased. A number of wells are
being put down.
The strain and excitement at Santa Bar
bara and neighboring suburbs, along the
beaches of which enterprising oil prospect
ors are putting up big derricks, continues.
Montecito is the latest fashionable suburb
to call for vigilance committees to protect
its restful beauty from industrial avarice.
The latest situation is thus set forth by a
Santa Barbara correspondent of the Los
Angeles Times:
"A terrible furor was raised in Monte
cito this afternoon by a transfer of 150 feet
of beach land belonging to a wealthy man
named Humphrey to Cody & Nelson, who
have made themselves prominent here by
pushing the matter of oil drilling on the
beach. The consideration in the present
transfer is said to have been $150. As the
land is located less than a quarter of a
mile from the Country Club, and close to
several pieces of land held as pleasure
grounds for picnics, bathing and boating,
the Montecito people are gTeatly con
cerned. This is the most serious move
yet made by the beach oil men. The pur
chasers assert that they will begin work
at once, and that nothing can stop them.
The probability is that the derricks they
put Up will not remain standing for fortv
eight hours. The fact has been closely
guarded, but a vigilance committee has
been secretly organized, every member of
which has agreed to fight the oil derricks
with violence if need be. This committee
has as members many of the best men in
Santa Barbara and Montecito. They have
determined to prevent the ruin of the
beach by force if they cannot act by law.
Humphrey is a man of means, and his
course is condemned, as it is said that he
will not only ruin his own property, but
all that around him, including Miramar,
the Country Club, several pleasure hold
lngs and the bathing at El Montecito." /Â»
An important discovery of kaolin, a pot
tery clay, is reported by the San Diego
Union to have been made in El Cajon
Mountain, about twenty miles east of San
Diego, some time ago by Charles String,
a prospector and miner, who is nego
tiating a sale for some large sum. Sev
eral locations cover the deposit, which
Eastern and Japanese experts are report
ed to have said is of exceptionally fine
quality. Mr. String has sunk a shaft nine
ty-five feet deep through the kaolin depos
its. The valuable clay extends from the
surface to a depth of eighty feet, and
from Indications on the surface has a
great width.
Two or three years ago the Ohio State
Mining Company was formed to get
riches out of the San Joaqin River above
Mlllerton in Fresno County by diverting
the stream. Twice a dam went away be
fore the gold came out and now it is
reported that success is at hand for this
week. The point at which the waters
will be diverted from the main channel
of the river is about three miles above
Milierton and just above the mouth of
Fine Gold Creek. The river flows through
the gorge formed of perpendicular walls
of rock. Just below the gorge at the
mouth of Fine Gold Creek is an eddy
This eddy is In one of those big "holes
In a stream's bedrock that are now and

sion to erect a cyanide plant at the mines
for the purpose of working over the tail-
Ings, the value of which, it is estimated,
is $900,000. Hearing on the application has
been set for September 4.
The business and professional men of
Nevada City are going to organize a lo
cal mining exchange for the purpose of
placing the desirable mines of this dis
trict before the world, says the Grass
Valley Tidings. They will engage an ex
pert to examine all mines proposed to
them, thus doing away with the services
of an outside expert, who usually does
more harm than good. J. O. DENNY.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES
Unfavorable reports of the D'Entrecas
teaux still continue, notwithstanding the
efforts to make her somewhat nearly the
ilated efficiency. Besides being short
two knots of the intended speed it is re
ported that owing to very faulty ventila
tion the hold of the ship was so hot when
under steam that it was deemed safest to
sail with empty magazines. The ship is
now on the Chtr.a station.
The Russian battleship Kniaz Potemkin
Taveitchesky will try a novelty in the ar
j rangement of its sixteen 6-inch quick
firers. They are to be placed on double
I mountings, so that one crew can manage
\ a pair of guns, and each of the two guns
'â  practically bears on exactly the came
! spot. This would ?"fm to double the hits,
i but it also doubles the misses, and the
i only advantage appears to be that a
: smaller crew is require,]. On the other
\ hand, a shot may disable both guns.
The Vickers Shipbuilding and Armfl
' ment Company of England has ordered
' four cantilever shipyard cranes from
; makers in the I'nii. B tea, and the
[Austrian Navy Departmeni -as ordered
| one of this type of cranes, to be located
at the dockyard at Trieste. The New
port News shipyard was the flrsi to Intro
duce this labor-saving appliance, by which
! frames, beams, plates and other weights
are hoisted up from the ground and then
deposited at either end or side of the ship
!on the stocks. The cantilever crane is
also extensively used in shipyards on the
northern lakts.
A new schedule of pay of supervising
officers (inspectors) of work in British
dockyards is shortly to go into effect.
The highest pay will be that of inspector::;
of shipwrights, of electrical fitters, hy
draulic work and of pattern-makers, who
will receive $<Â«0 to $850 per annum. The
other trade inspectors range from $500 to
$750. The inspectors are divided into three
classes, and their duties correspond with
those of foremen in our yards. There is,
however, this difference, that the British
inspector receives about 50 per cent more
pay than the best workman under his con
trol, while in our navy the difference be
tween workmen's and foremen's pay is
not so great.
A recent dispatch from London giving a
bare outline account of a new type of bat
tleship to be built from the design of Sir
Edwin White is being vigorously contra
dicted by the principal London papers.
They assert that the ship described as a
novelty of design is one out of four de
nominated as the Duncan class, one of
which was begun some months ago at
Devonport, and that these ships are not
different to any great extent fmrn the
ocean type all of which are afloat. The
statement that the Government was about
to build a lfi^j-inch wire-wound gun,
weighing 62 tons, is also contradicted,
there being no intention to make larger
guns for naval use than those of 12 inches.
An armored cruiser, to be named the
Marsellaise, is to be begun shortly at
Brest. She is to be a triple-screw, to de
velop a speed of 21 knots, and of the fol
lowing dimensions: Length, 453 feet;
breadth, 66 feet; draught, about 27 feet,
on which the displacement will be 10,014
tons The armor consists of a continuous
belt." of six-inch maximum thickness.
' above which the battery is protected by
I r^i-inch armor. The protective deck is
! 2 inches thick, and the turrets 7% inches.
The armament is composed of two 7.6
--inch eight 6.4-inch, six 3.0-inch, eighteen
175-inch and six 1.5-inch rapid-firing guns.
! The normal coal carried is 970 tons, and
! the bunkers have a capacity of 1590 tons.
Her estimated cost, complete, is $4,200,000.
General George Willis of the British
; army has remonstrated against the pub
! lieation of Brassey's Naval Annual, and
j says he is unable to understand how the
i British Government would permit the is
i suance of this publication. He asserts
i that Brassey's contains information con
! cerning the British navy which should not
i be known, and that the secrets and weak
I points of naval defense at Portsmouth
i were revealed. It Is evident that General
' Willis' reading Is very limited when he
! picks Brassey's Annual out as the sole
' means of information relating to navies
j and coast defenses. Mr. Brassey does not
! confine his criticism to British ships alone,
âº and The Engineer, Engineering and Lon
don Times are his authorities for home af
fairs. As to foreign naval information
there is no lack of it in France, Germany,
Italy and Russia, and while but little of
the United States navy can be gathered
from American papers, the London Engin
eer and The Engineering contain early and
authentic information in detail about
Uncle Sam's projected vessels. General
Willis' criticism has fallen flat, for Rear
Admiral Beresford has since expressed hia
approbation of Brassey's Annual and
commended its usefulness.

ALL EAGER TO
REACH LUZON'S
BATTLEFIELDS
Two Bis: Regiments
Now Ready.
EACH WANTS TO SAIL FIRST
LAST OF THE THIRTY-FIRST AND
THIRTY-FOURTH HERE.
They Will Probably Leave on the
Transports Sherman and Grant
Within the Next Two
Weeks.
The delayed battalions of the Thirty
first and Thirty-fourth regiments arrived
yesterday at the Presidio. The Third Bat
talion of the Thirty-first, under Major
John E. McMahon, arrived at the OaklaJid
mole Saturday evening, but on account of
the lateness of the hour the men were
on board the train all night and were
marched to camp in the morning. They
w -f. re heartily cheered along the line of
march. The headquarters and band of the
regiment, with Colonel Pettit and one
any of the third battalion, arrived at
the camp Saturday evening.
The Third Battalion of the Thirty-
rourth also arrived yesterday corning,
under command of Major Joseph Wheeler,
son of General Joe Wheeler. It reached
camp about the same time as Major Mc-
Mahon's command, and now the question
arises, Which regiment was here first?
The question is not an important one ex
cept as it bears on the other questionâ
Which shall leave first? It is claimed the
Thirty-fourth first reported for duty to
the headquarters of the Department of
California, but the Thirty-first claims it
reported just as early, and besides it had
been three days on the road before the
Thirty-fourth started westward.
The first two battalions of the Thirty
first arrived here last Friday under com
mand of Lieutenant Colonel W. C. Hayes.
The battaliuns had started the Saturday
preceding from Fort Thomas, iventucky.
On the way ever they stopped at Denver
just as the Thirty-fourth had assembled
for transportation, and the regiments, or
the vanguards of the regiments, came out
!'r<>m Denver practically together. The
two battalions of ac Thirty-first arrived
in the morning, and the First Battalion of
the Thirty-fourth arrived in the evening.
Since then sections of both regiments have
been arriving.
The first regiment to go will probably
be assigned to the Sherman, a vessel that
will easily take the entire regiment. After
that the Grant or the Hancock will be
available, or perhaps the Columbia, but
the Columbia will not take a full regi
ment of 1300 men, and neither commanuer
is willing to have his command divided if
it can be avoided. They will get away
about September 10 or 12.
Both regiments are camped in the old
casual camp on the ridges and in the hol
lows running down toward the post build
ings from the Pacific street entrance to
the Presidio. Both are fine regiments, and
among them are many who served
through the Cuban campaigns. It is
claimed that In the Thirty-fourth there
are Cuban veterans numerous enough to
make up 40 per cent of the command.
Both regiments are eager to reach the
Philippines as soon as possible.
The Idaho regiment will be mustered
out of the service on the 25th inst. It
has been announced, but not officially,
that the North Dakota men will he mus
tered out on the same day, and that the
Wyoming battalion and the Wyoming
light battery will be mustered out'on the
23d inst.
The men of the First California Regi
ment will give up their arms and equip
ments to-day. The guard turned in its
arms yesterday. From now on the guard
-â¢â¢'i will be one for the protection of
pn perty only, and consequently it will be
much smaller than it has been.
The Colorado men will be mustered out
on the Sth inst. The rolls of the regimpnt
have been turned in to the paymaster and
the work of. the company commanders has
been finished. The men are only awaiting
the pleasure of the Government and the
coming of the paymaster.
Shoe Salesman Injured.
John J. Puirh, a salesman at J. T. Sul
livan's shoe store, sustained a fracture of
the thiph yesterday afternoon while at
tempting to board a train at Valencia
street station.
The train for I'nion Coursing Park was
a long one, drawn by two engines. These
passed the station at considerable speed
which Pugh miscalculated. He tried to
board a car near the hr-ad of the train,
which stopped a hundred feet beyond'
He was thrown to the ground with great
force, but rolled out of the way of the
wheels. An ambulance was sent for and
the injured man was removed to the City
and County Hospital, where the fracture
was reduced.
On a Fair Way to Recovery.
D. C. McDougall, an attorney from San
ta Rosa, who took an overdose of chloraJ
nt 12^9 Market street Saturday night, re
turned to consciousness yesterday and
the physicians at the Receiving Hospital

ST. MATTHEW'S CHURCH IN
SAN MATEO DEDICATED
Formal Consecration of the Sacred Edifice.
THE cornerstone of the new St.
Matthew's Catholic Church, on
East street, between Second and
Third, in San Mateo, was laid yes
terday mornlnâ¢ with solemn and im
pressive ceremonies. Archbishop Rlor
dan presided at the dedication services,
which were preceded by high mass In
the old edifice, immediately opposite to
the new site, on which will be reared
one of the most beautiful church
structures In this State. A large con
gregation was in attendance.
Father James A. Cooper, pastor of
Ocean View Church, celebrated the
mass, assisted by Father Patrick J.
Cummings. pastor of St. Patrick's
Church, San Francisco: Father James
A. <"al!aghan, pastor of St. Matthew's
Church, and Father Patrick Mulligan.
After the mass was ended the Arch
bishop delivered a short address, In
which he referred strongly to the old
church which had done its good work
for years and was now to be replaced
by a handsome one for the pur;
bringing all people to eternal glory.
He concluded by commendin~ the work
to the generosity of tne people of the
parinh.
The congregation then filed out and
took seats which had been placed in
front of the foundation of the new
church. A procession Led by Father
Callaghan. followed by the
bearer and several acolytes, the Arch
bishop In full canonicals, attended by
Fathers Cummings and Mulligan,
moved toward a large wooden cross
where the main altar will be erected.

Makes a Very Impassioned Speech,
Arraigning the Philippine
War and the Admin
istration.
Special Dispatch to Trie Call.
PROVIDENCE, Sept. 3.â The first meet
ing of the New England Bimetallic
League was held at Crescent Park this
afternoon. Judge James P. Tarvin of
Kentucky was the first speaker. He said:
It Is well settled that the Chicago platform
of 18S6 will not be mutilated, that the Demo
era national convention of 1900 will adopt
that platform without omissions and independ
ent bimetallism at 16 to 1 will continue to
receive the support of the Democratic organi
zation of the country- The efforts of polit cat
busies in New York City, in Chicago and else-
here to obstruct and to defeat those who de
clared for the laborer and producer before the
holders of capital and organizers of trusts
have miserably failed, and there is nothing
left for them but to choose between the pre
tense of party loyalty and an open transfer
to Republicanism. We will have again the
platform made by the people in IBM, and
there will not be a dissenting voice when Wil
liam J. Bryan Is placed on the platform to
again lead the common and obscure people in
This land to contest against the control of the
Government by those representing the
money power of the union.
That platform will be added to. There will
be appropriate declarations as to imperialism
and trusts; and as for me. I would be glad to
see a declaration favorable to the public own
ership of public utilities: a declaration favor
able to the initiative and referendum, and a
demand for the election of United States Sen
ators and United States Judges by the peo
ple.
Congressman John J. Lentz of Colum
bus, Ohio, was the next speaker. His
sarcastic reference to President McKln
ley, his arraignment of the Philippine war
and his eulogy of Aguinaldo as one of the
greatest men of the century, were ap
plauded. He spoke in part as follows:
From Ohio we look to New England with
amazement when we see the cringing servility
of its masses to that plutocratic oligarch,
which is more arbitrary and more inconsistent
than any monarchy in Europe.
You will pardon me for telling you that the
thinking people In the Buckeye land are more
than Surprised when they find that In this old
v. w England country which for two centuries
arroeated to Itself the claim of being the edu
cational center and Intellectual hub of Ameri
ca there are to-day so many blind and ser
vll'e followers of an administration. in sup-
Dort of Its policy of imperialism and militar
ism in support of its British financial policy.
Its Brltsh colonial policy and its attempted
British alliance.
There was prolonged cheering when Ex-
Governor John P. Altgeld of Illinois was
introduced.
There was a period In New England history,
he said when mills and factories were running
day and night and a market was found for
everything made. Then the people were all
employed at living wages. The speaker argued
that the remonetizatton of silver would afford
an opportunity for the wage-earners to have
more money to spend and thus open up mar
kets at home which would utilize to the full
est extent the products of the country.

LONDON. Ky.. Sept. 3.â A report is cur- j
rent that Deputy Sheriff Lewis of Man- ;
Chester, was killed yesterday in Clay
County. Several weeks ago in Manches- '
After blessing the spot the procession
took up a position in front of the cor
nerstone, where the Arcnblshop con
tinued his prayers of dedication.
During the march the i-.ale choir of
St. Mary's Cauiedral, assisted by the
local church choir, directed by Father
Jerome Hannigan. intoned the "Nisi
Dominua" and ".L.ocus Iste."
The Archbishop' then, placing his
hand on the cornerstone, consecrated
It to the service of God, and it was
lowered in its place. A cnpner box
was then placed in the niche preserved
for it. It contained a p;rrchment scroll
with the names of Pope Leo XIII,
President McKinley. the Governor
of the State of California. Arch
bishop Rionian and a large num
ber of the State's clergy and the faith
ful, and requested the invocation of
the Apostle Matthew, after whom the
church is namÂ°u. A book containing
the namis of all who subscribed to the
building and copies of the Pan Mateo
Leader an.) the San Francisco Monitor
and a silver coin of each denomination,
were also placed in tne receptacle.
The Archbishop accompanied by his
attendants, then sprinkled holy wat >r
on every part of the site and then took
- nan improvised platform where
Father "'ummings "reached the dedi
cation sermon. In his opening 1 re
marks Father Cummins? con" lat
ed the priests and the people of San
;â  hi the commencement of the
grpat work, and said:
"Man can build no house holier than
that consecrated by the presence of
God and â¢*â¢Â» prayers of His faithful.
- â¢ work of great importance, and
should enlist the sympathies of all
having tnp interest of humanity at
heart. Man must ever be better for

ter Deputy Stubblefleld was shot by Mart
Smith. The latter, escaping capture, went
to his home and sent word to the county
! officials that he would never attend court
alive, therefore it would be fatal for
persons to attempt to take him.
Yesterday Lewis went to serve papers
on him arid according to the rumor he
was shot dead as he approached Smith's i
1 houpe. If the report is true, this makes
i the third killing in Clay County last week.
BATTLE FOR LIFE
WITH A FIERCE SHARK
TACOMA, Sept. 3.â A special from Neah
Bay says: While out salmon lishing yes
terday "Light House Jim," one of the In
dian Judges there, was attarked by a
shark while on his way to shore with a
small canoe full of salmon. The shark bit
the sides of the canoe and tipped it so as
to reach into tne canoe and grab a salmon,
biting it in two and taking part of it.
Jim clubbed the shark over the head and
drove it away.
Some Quillayute Indians landed a whale
at Lapush a few days ago. While one of
the Indians was removing the harpoons
a big shark attacked his boat and over
turned it. The Indian was thrown Into the
water ntar the shore which he endeav
ored to reach. The; shark was too quick
for him. and caught the Indian just below
the hip. A struggle ensued, during which
the Indian jabbed his knife Into the
shark's body several times. He did not
escape until the shark had taken a big
bite of flesh out of his leg, making an
uelv and painful wound.
DETERMINED TO STRIKE.

LONDON, Sept. 3.â The demonstrations
organized to-day at Cardiff, Hull, Bristol
and Liverpool by the sailors' and fire
men's unions were well atended. At all

"Dear Mrs. Pixkhamâ l think it is
my duty to write to you expressing
my sincere gratitude for the wonder-
ful relief I have experienced by the use
of Lydia E. Pinkhams Vegetable Com-

different kinds of medicine. I would
feel better at timea, then would be
as bad as ever.
' ' For eight years I was a great suf-
ferer. I had falling of the womb and
was in such misery at my monthly
periods I could not work but a little
before I would have to lie down. Your
medicine has made a new woman of me.
I can now work all day and not get
tired. I thank you for what you have
done for me. I shall always praise
your medicine to all suffering women."
â Mks. E. E. Kuhn. Germaxo, Ohio.
" I have taken eisrht bottles of Lydia
E. Pinkhams Vegetable Compound
and used two packages of your Sana-
tive Wash, also some of the Liver Pills,
and I can say that your remedies will
do all that you claim for them. Before
taking your remedies I was very bad
with womb trouble, was nervous, had
no ambition,, could not sleep, and my
food seemed to do me no good Now I
am well, and your medicine has cured
me. I will gladly recommend your med-
icine to every one wherever I go." â

DUDES WIN THE
MATCH IN THE
NINTH INNING
Played a High Order
of Baseball.
ONLY A SINGLE RUN SCORED
CRABS TAKE THE MORNING
GAME BY A CLOSE MARGIN.
Good Hitting- and Fine Fielding Seen
in Both Games â Large and En
thusiastic Crowds in At
tendance.
Oakland 1, Santa Cruz 0.
Every second of the nine innings was
.; yesterday afternoon by the
I Dudes to win a remarkably scientific }
I game from the Lobsters. For eight in- ;
nings and a half neither side could put |
a man over the plate, and the few vibra
tions the atmosphere of Recreation Park
experienced warmed the heart of the
baseball crank.
To Mr. Dunleavy and Mr. Sehmeer be
long the glory of the only run of the day. i
The heavy hitting Dude was on 'third
when Sehmeer came to the bat, two men
having been epitaphed. Schmeer hit a j
hot one to Arrelanes, who fielded the ball j
prettily, but his throw to first was not |
so good and Streib dropped it, giving
Dunleavy all the chance in the world to |
score and placing Schmeer safe on the i
j first pedestal. The game ended right
there and the Dudes almost burst for
Joy.
The crowd was one of the largest of j
the season and it came all the way from
BernaJ Heights and even Oakland, which
burg is now displaying an uncanny inter
est in the Dudes. Strange, w^lrd noises
floated over the field from time to time,
emanating from the Oakland section, and
once Rube Levy's life was threatened by
Swing's personal following, when he
called Frank out at second, because they
I thought he made a two-bagger. But the ;
Oakland short died and the Athenic con- ;
tingent gave way to a boisterous but i
harmless wrath.
Until the sixth inning th-re was not
an exciting moment. The Lobsters, who
were at the bat, then gave the baseball
heart a chance to flutter. Williams made
his first bag on a clean and honest hit,
stole second and jogged to third on a
passed ball. Two men had perished be
fore all this happened, but the Lobsters \
refused to be disheartened. To raise i
hopes Devereaux cantered to first on four
of those that did not please the critical
eye of Rube Levy. Dalrymple picked up
his stick and Tuttle refused to breathe for
a minute. There wasn't anything to it,
for Borchera became unsolvable and Dal- .
rymple was the third to die with Deve- j
reaux ornamenting the last station on the I
home course. . :
In the seventh and eighth innings Oak
land had her fingers on the score board,
but missed great and glorious opportuni- ]
i ties. Franks hit what might have been \
! a real two-bagger, but he was caught at
! second. Following him came Dunieavy,
who swatted the spheroid in the same di- ;
rection, but a little further down the i
field. Three bases was his portion and
despite the fact that only one man had
died there Mr. Dunleavy remained, for |
Lange and Sehmeer, who followed him,
also perished. In the eighth inning things â 
looked sable and drear for the Crawfish, j
M skiman, Borchers and Hutchinson
' filled the bags, with only a single man re
tired. Whalen settled down, however, .
and the Dudes went to the benches with- ;
out having crossed the plate.
The game was a pitchers' battle, both |
Borchers= and Whalen twirling in most ex- j
cellent fashion. There were few hits and
few errors, Arrelanes being responsible
i for two out of the three registered against I
the IyObbters.
The score is:

MORNING GAME.
Snnta Cruz 4, Oakland 3.
The morning game at Oakland gave the
Lobsters their single victory in the Â»erles
of games. The eighth inning won the
match for the beach promenaders whan
they mustered up their batting forces and
si-m three of their men across the plate
taster than ever Crabs moved before.
Oakland scored twice in the eighth, just
enough to lose them the game by a sin
gle tally.
It was necessary to try a brace of
pitchers, both Borchors and Steffani

GOOD SPORT AT UNION PARK
A DESPERATE COURSE ENDS
ROYAL FLUSH'S CHANCES.
The Ultimate Winners Run Consist
ently Throughout the Races.
Fog Finally Obscures
the View.
The sporting adage that "blood will
j tell' was given fresh Illustration at Union
I Coursing Park yesterday. \i. F. Ander
j sun's imported dogs Crawford Lad and
Crawford Braes, both sired by Falconer,
ran one-two in the most valuable open
stake of the year. They won on their
j merits, as during the afternoon they were
j called upon to meet the dogs most fan
-1 clod for the stake. This Is Mr. Ander
: Bon's most notable victory, although his
1 dogs have always performed consistently.
Crawford Lad showed his form in his
first time out in the morning by leading
and defeating the great Conneraara, In
the succeeding rounds he defeated Hur
| ricane, Flyaway and Firm Friend. Craw
i ford Braes beat Royal Buck, Petronlus,
Luxon, Brutus and Wait-a-Little.
Royal Flush was running well, and
seemed likely to make this his fourth
stake in succession. In the third round,
however, he met Pretender, and lost any
chances he may have had. The two game
dogs coursed the bare all over the Held,
Flush winning finally. He was beaten in
the succeeding round by Wait-a-Little.
The coursing was good throughout the
day, but some of the best of the sport was
marred by a dense fog which rolled in
from the ocean during the afternoon. The

ANOTHER RAILROAD
FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN
STOCKTON AND SACRAMENTO
TO BE CONNECTED.
New Line Said to Be a Branch of the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe System.
Surveys will be begun on the 13th mat.
for a fifty-mile line of railroad which is
to connect Stockton with Sacramento and
open up the fruitful belt of wheat-pro
ducing reclaimed lands and orchards on
the north side of Stockton channel. Al
though it is generally conceded by the
wise ones in the San Joaquin metropolis
that the new road is to be neither more
nor less than one of the branches of the
Santa Fe into the Sacramento Valley,
none but local capital has so far appeared
in the project. The two men most prom
inently mentioned among those behind It
are Arthur Thornton, a wealthy fruit
grower of Newhope, and Theodore Gier
of Oakland, who is heavily interested in
the reclaimed lands along Stockton chan
nel.
Frank L. Compton, surveyor-in-chief of
the new line, arrived in this city yester
day to arrange matters preliminary to
the survey. In speaking of the proposed
line he said: "The people who are behind
the project already have clear right of
way from Stockton into Sacramento.
Agents have been at work for two months
past securing titles and bonds, and now
everything is ready for the survey. As
soon as that is completed construction
will be begun. The road will start from
the north side of the channel at a point
where it can be connected by a draw
bridge with the Santa Pc line. It will
run from there directly into Newhope, and
then through the thirty miles of or
chards to Sacramento. The capital is on
hand, and the road will be built."
Every farmer and orchardist along the
line is enthusiastic. At present the only
shipping facilities from the north side are
the river boats, and as a means of fruit
transportation they are not satisfactory
According to Mr. Compton the line can
be built as cheaply as it is possible to
build railroads. There is no grading, and
a simple ballasted roadbed will be suffi
cient to carry the company's cars into the
capital. â  â¢
Mr. Comptom returns to Stockton to
day.

RUNAWAY CARS
CRASH INTO A
PASSENGER TRAIN
A Disaster Narrowly
Averted.
CARS WERE NOT LOADED
USUAL RESULT OF THE RAIL-
ROAD'S ECONOMY.
Old Rolling Stock From the "Bone-
yard" Made to Do Duty as
Special Trains for Cours
ing Men.
The good fortune of the Southern Pacific
Railway officials, which seems to protect
the passengers on their road under che
most trying conditions, averted what
might have been a dire disaster yester
day. Three cars became detached from a
train near T'nion Coursing Park and
crashed Into other cars on a siding. There
were no passengers on any of the carp,
so the only damage was in broken glass
, and smashed platforms.
The obvious negligence of the railway
I officials in sending out cars which have
â  long since been re-legated to the "bono
! yard" was the primary cause of the ac
' cident. There was an unusual demand for
! rolling stock yesterday, owing to a blf
excursion to Monterey. This to?k up all
I the available cars, and the trains
i to the coursing park wera mad.- up of
| those long since condemned,
There were Pullman sleepers with tat
! tered curtains and faded upholstery, and
windows so grimr with dust as to almost
shut out the lignt; emigrant sleep;
â  an ancient trie; in fact, any kind ol a car
! one remove frum those used for carrying
1 \ train (Â»f these cars, without alo
tlve attached, was standing on the track
: opposite Union Park. The engineer of the
I other train wished to remove his cars
j from the siding to the main track. In
1 starting them the strain proved too great,
; and the coupling between some of the cars
: gave way. Three of them started down
i the incline toward the other train. There
â  was no one to apply the brakes, and they
' rapidly gained impetus, having several
i hundred yards to run. Th< engineer saw
â  the danger and blew quick blasts on the
' locomotive whistle.
Those in line of danger were chi.-ily
I railway employes, and they BOUghi Bhelter
from 'the expected Bhower oi 3plinters,
1 The cars came together with a -
1 crash, the platforms being telescoped and
the windows broken. The i ars did not
! leave the track, and the train hands lost
1 no time in removing every vestige pf the
i collision. The damaged rolling stock was
cut out of the train and taken to the side
track at Ocean View. wh< re It attract
ed much attention for the remainder of
! the afternoon.

PLACE HUNTERS
FENCE-BUILDING
FOR NEXT YEAR
Daiton Would Like to
Go to Congress.
ROWE MAY BEAT ROETH
STRATTON'S "RETIREMENT" IS
LIKELY GRATUITOUS.
City Hall Promoters Are Not Cover
ing Themselves "With. Glory.
3irard Thinks More Might
Be Accomplished.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
&3S Broadway, Sept. 3.
AbJUt a year from now there will be
some county conventions held. A year is
a long time in which to make â  para
tions, but the Alameda politician always
believes in beginning early. Even now
there is practically a complete programme
outlined to place before the electors next
November. Of course, it will be changed
in places, but the basis Is in existence
sr. i some people are working as hard a*
ti\ JUgh the conventions were to be held
next wek. More than the ordinary inter
est clings to the large territory east and
north of Lake Merritt. This is the mu
nicipal bailiwick of Councilman Rowe; the
field in which Frank Jordan does county
politics; where Senator Stratton holds the
senatorial field; where one Howard
Wright was elected to the Assembly, and
where a certain Mr. Roeth also secured
enough votes to make him Supervisor.
With the exception of the County Clerk
all these offices will rave to be filled next
fall; hence the scramble. To add to the
complication, it might also be noticed that
Henry P. Dalton "would like to go ;o
Congress."
This interesting combination is talking.
Some elements in it will succeed them
selves; others will succeed their unsuc
cessful rre-iecessors. At various times
rumor has retired Senator Stratton by his
own dtrsirv. At no time can I remember
knowing of any such sentiment expressed
directly by the Senator, but in this big
incubator of successful and amateur poli
ticians, cne can hear anything, and only
t. lifetime of, experience car. make any
body competent to do the necessary sift-
Ing. Just in the flush of the success ol
his primary lew. which has easily made
Tree! Stratton the most prominent Sena
tor in the Statr of California, it is very
unlikely that he is clous to close his
â  olitical life so suddenly.
Howard Wright will hardly be elected
againâ in Oakland. It will not be sur
; rising if a pledge regarding certain mat
â¢ . r t Were required of his successor. East
â  ikland; which was made a power in poli
tlcs, and is largely maintained by Dr.
George Pardee. is not likely to sena an
ther man to the Assembly who will be
cut for everything in sight and stultify
his high effic* 1 by voting to send an cm
l ezzler to the United States Senate. Such
I ractlces do not represent that district.
Supervisor Roeth will have to eat sev
eral good men for the nomination for his
teat- H. D. Rowe Is a name that has
frequently been as a possible Super
visor from that district. Howe has been
Two and a half years In the City Council,
a.-d his record compares favorably with
that of any of his colleagues. In the last
Council he did pome good politics. Two
rr.cr.ths ago the gentleman from the
Seventh transferred his business from
San Francisco *.o Oakland, and he has
since easily been one of the most promi
nent men at the City Hall. It must bÂ«
admitted that he has shown a consistency
in financial matters rare among Council
men. In no case has he been guilty of the
common practice of making a speech ad
vocating economy and of voting to double
salaries and fill the City Hall with type
writers, in the next breath. Neither has
Rowe u?ed his office for the purpose of
benefiting the family. If he be in reality
laying the foundation for a Supervisorial
ca'mpaicn. it may be said that many suc
cessful "fights have been made on a less
7. v TZ~ s-^TUa, Hcnrr Da..â¢
â  . "altoi
â¢â¢would like to go to Congress." This ex
pression from most politicians would b-.
equivalent to a declaration of candidacy.
This is not the case with Mr. Dalton. He
c-'^-p not nominate himself, but modestly
t-'.TT.its that he is available if the -people
want him. Mr. Dalton's candidacies are
always "in the hands of his friends," and
up to date his friends have been remark
ably successful. A few years ago Mr. Dal
ton" said he would like to sit In the City
Council. He was elected to that office,
later he said he would ISXe to be County
Assessor. He 7as elected on an inde
pendent campaign, beating the regular
party nominee. At the end of his first
term he said he would like to succeed
himself. This time he took a party nom
cation and received three and a half votes
cut of every five cast. With this record
wren Mr Dalton says he would "like" to
have anything. It would be good policy to
attach "some significance to his desire.
This is not political gossip, for Fome of
"M- Dalton's very closest supporters have
confided to me the little fact. It would
perhaps be as well to let Victor H. Met
calf at least see Washington before de
c'<*(rjr upon his successor, but Alameda
r.'wavs takes politics by the forelock, al
though apparently everything else can
wait. __
Several of the Councllmen have said at
r meetings recently that many months
have gone by and they have not as yet
done anything-. This is true, as it is also
true that half a dozen times nothing will
not produce much, and a cipher, from
present indications, will have to be used
to represent the achievements of Â«*â 
Council when it goes out of office.
Mr. Cuvellier apparently knew what he
wa.Â« saying two weeks after he and Us
confreres took office. Cuvelller wanted a
commission appointed to procure data
ar.d report upon the prospects of the pur
chase of a water plant by the city. His
brethren laughed at him and told him
there wa& r.o hurry. Cuvellier was im
petuous ar.d after a few weeks gained his
point but It was not accomplished with
out a struggle. "There is no hurry is
apparent!-.- the motto of over one-half of
the Councllmen. The only hurry that has
been exhibited to date is in the efforts to
place friends and relatives in snug berths.
This Btultifying of oKce Is very marked
In one particular. The Council is fre
quently exploiting the idea thai the heaa3
of departments should txÂ» given the fullest
liberty in running their departments. It
is admitted that Chief of Police Hodg
kir.s Is a competent man for hi? position.
He has stated a dozen times officially to
the Council and Board of Works that the
combination man of the department who
does police duty and acts as clerk is one
of the most indispensable men on the
force. No one has yet been found to deny
this. For three months, however, a pica
yunleh effort has teen made to abolish
this ofFce. under the subterfuge that it
would save Jli>3 a year. Sjch a sugges
tion is the emtodimer.t of a falsehood, for
there is already in existence a resolution
authorizing the appointment of a clerk
to the chief at a salary of tÂ»0 a year.
This remarkable piece of government has
id! been brought about and has been pes
â¢f-ring the Council and Beard of Works
Ujt three months by the desire of a mea
; â¢ r to create a place for a relative. This
\s not the first Instance of the kind, but It
deceives nobody. If the real desire be to
â¢ conomixe It could be done in a thousand
different ways, and certainly th* saving
6f Â»:<0 which, according to the man who
should knowâ the Chic* of Policeâ would
not be a saving, need not engross the at
tention of the city government for three
months. In the meantime tens of thou
sands of dollars are being wasted every
month through the failure of the city gov
ernment to carry out some of the really
jr*ritorlcua schemes which were induced
In the platforms upon which they were
elected.
Councilman Glrard may be a little se
vere, but he certainly tells much truth in
â -â " following language:
"I don't believe this Council will do
anything," he ..aid. "The Councilraen
do a lot of talking and advance no end of
Interesting theories, but there their use
fulness ends. There ie constant antago
nism and a notlceabie conflict of personal
interests wherever you turn. When one
man springs an idea the carrying out of
which would benefit the city there are a
dozen others ready to cry" him down:
Everybody wants to get ail the glory in
sight, and the result is that thing is
ever accomplished. I don't think the wa
ter scheme or any of the other schemes
will go through
'"Our tax levy 'is all wrong. We give a
lot of money to the High School, which is
a worthless institution. None of the
pupils learn anything there. I know o.
many people who have taken their chil
dren away from the High School because
it :s a waste of time to s^nd them there.
And yet we take away the funds of the
grammar schools, which are a necessity.
to further the interests of the High
School, which is a luxury. The constitu
tion demands thai we give the Â» children
a good grammer school education: ana
yet our present system dwarfs that phase
bf our scheme of free education.
At Sacramento Henry P. Dalton used
an interesting expression- During cne c-f
the warmest periods of his conversation
with the State Equalizers he said: "Gen
tlemen: no I've, living man could answer
those Questions.'" For a little while some
of the gentlemen thought that In his
earnestness Mr. Daltbn had used & phrase
that conflicted somewhat with the rules
of grammar. It was. nothing surprising
that a mar. from Oakland should use such
words Mr. Pa!tcn doubtless had in his
mind having become so wedded to his
Tax' rolls, visions of some of the dead-
Uvtng mer of Oakland from whom he had
himself trie*' to extract some information
! their property. There are many
of them and until they are translated
Oakland's material progress will etiil be
in the future. L'alton knew whereof he
*Poke.
I would recommend that a bulletin
boards be placed en the front of the City
Hall upon which should be posted weekly
the progress of the following proposed
improvements:
Acquiring a municipal water plant.
Installing salt water street sprinkling
plant.
Opening West street and making it a
boulevard.
Opening Washington street.
Erection of a new City Hall.
Improving Lake Merritt.
Obliterating the marsh In West Oak
land.
Improving Independence square.
Purchasing a system of public parks.
Preparing for election of freeholders.
Preparing for needed bond election.
Putting lazy prisoners at work making
new streets.
It may not have occurred to those to
whom is entrusted these responsibilities,
but It Is nevertheless true that the pro
jects mentioned are of vastly gTeater im
portance and interest to the people living
in Oakland than the efforts of selfish men
to run the city government In the inter
ests of their individual families or polit
ical ambitions. STUART W. BOOTH.

ard, Upton and â ""â -â  and also Mayer
Snow and Auditor Breed, attended the
meeting. The rest of The Counciimen are
either out of town or could not be pres
ent, but those in attendance represented
a majority, and as they can pass the or
dinance ar.d the Mayor has signified his
intention of approving it. the matter may
be considered as settled.
"When Auditor Breed presented his esti
mates one month ago an attempt was
made to reduce in me place* and in
crease in others. For several evenings the
Council, silting as a committee of the
whole, discussed the tax levy ana the
Auditor's details. But they have at las;
arrived at the conclusion that the work
of Mr. Bre^d is practically perfect and
that it will admit of no changes.
The city will be maintained on the dol
lar limit, and the li cents is for bond in
terest and redemption.
The Auditor's apportionment of each
fund was sustained, with the single ex
ception of adding enough money to the
general fund to pay the expenses of a
bond election; and this was done by cut
ting a half-cent from the police fund and
adding it to the general fund.
The entire estimates involved the ex
penditure of nearly JI.OOQ.OM. and as this
is Auditor Breed's first essay in the direc
tion of municipal finance hi? office is par
ticularly pleased. It is somewhat remark
able that the Auditor's estimates were not
changed; when it is considered that near
ly every Councilman wanted money for
some specific improvement in his ward.
and consequently was ready to cut eeti
matf= if elven an opportunity.
BERKELEY NOW AWAITS
COACH COCHRAN'S ARRIVAL
BERKELEY, Sept. 3.â Garret Cochran
Is expected to arrive at the University of
California on the 15th of this month.
With him will come Kelly, the crack
halfback of Princeton. Both men will be
gin immediately to ~et the Berkeley team
Sixty players will be on the gridiron
when the first kickoff of rha season takes
place. This is the number that signed the
roll last week, and it includes some of the
best material the blue and gold has seen
on the field. Of the olu varsity men who
played in last Thanksgiving game but
thre^ have had to lay tide their padded
football suits. Athearn forsakes the grid
iron this year because of a pressure of
college work. Craig and Bart Thane are
no longer eligible for places in the team.
Cochran will, therefore, have to pick out
' three men f"r these positions. To masters
is practically conceded the place of end
instead of Craig, and to Gamman. the
freshman just entered, the place of quar
ter back instead of Thane. Atuearn's
position as center is still unfilled.
Cochran's advent will be the signal for
a tremendous outburst of enthusiasm on
the part of the college men. As the coach
of last year's victorious team, he has been
idolized" since the big game, and this sea
son will probably be ahead of any past
one in demonstrations connected with the
football field.

OAKLAND. Sept. Shortly after 1
o'clock this afternoon four hangers-on at
Mrs. Appleton'B ealoon at Fourth and Jef
ferson streets, created a disturbance and
were ordered out by the barkeeper, Alfred
LJmbstrom. One of the quartet, said to
be Thomas Downey, resisted and the bar
keeper was compelled to use force to eject
him. While being pushed out Downey
whipped out a lather's hatchet and aimed
a terrific blow at the barkeeper, who
raised his arm just in time to receive the
full force on his right hand, which was
almost severed.
The assault was witnessed by George
"West who was not slow In declaring It
to be a cowardly act. Shortly afterward,

was booked for assault to murder. He Is
a lather by occupation and has a family.
At the residence of Martin Deai son, a

Odd Fellows' Hall was Oiled to the doors
with a crowd that gave all its attention
to the speakers and frequently added
their approval to the statements made by
prolonged ar.d enthusiastic applause.
The afternoon session was called to or

presiding officer. M. S. Norton, who spoke
on the subject of "Mental Science in
Spiritualism." . He said that with the
growth of spiritualism the "occupation of

the speaker, "that it Is c-r duty to so

plored that there was considerable spirit
ual unreasoning, especially among those
who claim the spirit phenomenon as a
fact without being able to demonstrate
it. She believed that the religious belief
of the spiritualists is the most consistent
with the happiness of man for the reason
that "those whom we have loved and who
have gone before return in the spirit and
let us know of their welfare in the great
beyond." . . 'V :

for th:>*e who do not believe In the spirit

to stop and argue with them. He believes
that man is in the spirit here and now.
â¢'This Is the greatest thought he has
ever attempted .to grasp," he continued.
"Heretofore we have lived from without,
but now we live from within, ignoring en
tirely all external influences. We need not
wait for the change called death to dem

neither Faints nor sinnersâ we are embryo
gods on earth. We can have either heav

entirely upon ourselves, as we become

?n the programme of Mrs. Eudora B. Mar
cen, who was unable to be present on ac
count of sickness. Her subject was
â¢"Spiritualism In Our Daily Life." Pro
fessor Bowman did not attempt to follow
the subject, but started to infuse a little
fun into the session. He said that three
and a half hours of. talking: 7.-ithout music
was simply awful, especially when no
doctors had been provided to save the
audience from being talked to death.
"This thing without music," he said,
"is like a lemonade with the lemon left
out. But, getting down to business, who
knows what spiritualism is. anyway?
Some say it is science, others that it is
philosophy and still others that it is re
ligion. The fact is, it is all three."
A. Mark Stoddard of Alameda was down
or. the programme to throw light on the
question, "Where Are We At?" He was
not very clear 01 the subject himself. He
said that he was a spiritualist, but that
he dl . not know why, and that he did
not believe that any of the spiritualists
knew what they believed In. He disagreed
with all of the speakers who had preceded
him, and said he expected to do the same
with all that followed him. When he fin
ished his remarks President Hambly took
occasion to reassure the audience by In
forming them that he "guessed we are all
there yet."
Other subjects discussed were: "The Ly

The Incumbent Greets His Con

The Rev. D. C. Garret: preached yes
terday morning his first sermon in this
city at St. Luke's. A brilliant throng
crowded the edifice to its fullest capacity,
and many who came were unable to gain
admittance. Bishop. Mor eland was the
celebrant of the communion service. -
The vested choir of fifty voices under
the direction of the choirmaster and or

NEW INSTRUMENT
Called the Nethoscope for Precision
in Studying Cloud Forms.
A step In advance in the science of me
teorology has been made at the Audito
rium tower. A new Instrument by means
of which an ectirel-- new precision in
=---, : -.- of cloud forms and movements Is
possible has been placed. This new piece
of apparatus is called the nethos ope.
This little device enable? exact observa
tion of cloud movements, and it Is hoped
that after some time the weather men
wiil be able to foretell from the action
and conformation of the clouds swimming
in the bright sky the weather that Is to
come. They think it not unlikely that
long series of observations in many places
in all weathers will give data that will
connect certain cloud forms wit comsn?
thunder-storms or cold waves or drench
ing rain c or cyclones. Again, it is expect
ed thatarter ions observation the velocity
of the clouds may enable the forecasters
to predict the winds to come.
However, all this is in the future. For
the present the weal men can do no
mo~e than take observations with t^e
rethoscopo day and night md Sundays
and send the carefully marked charts to
Washington, where mathematicians will
compare states of the barometer with the
cloud shapes and speeds. It has been
found already that there is connection be
tween the cloud conformations and veloc
ities within single thermal zones.
The nothoscope is simple. A circular
mirror with black instead of silver back
ground is fixed in a frame so that It can
be accurately leveled. Rising upward
from one edge of the black mirror Is a
Eteel wire that has a cross-arm, also of
wire. The two look like a ship's mast
with a yard across it. From the tip of the
mast, to make the resemblance more com
plete, runs a thread of ri^iring that ex
tends to the center of the black mirror
and there vanishes through a hole.
The instrument is used by retting a
sieht of the cloud In the black mirror.
Then the mastllke wire is moved until
the eye sights over its tip and ju.n
catches the edge of the cloud's reflection
at the center of the mirror. The tiny
thread is pulled taut from masthead to
center and Its angle from the plane of the
mirror measured with a scale. Next a
calculation ie made and the angle of the
cloud's altitude is secured. From this car.
be deduced the cloud's height from the
ground. This done, the measurement of
its size is simple, the observer having a
scale cut Into the polished face of the
mirror. The velocity Is measured on the
same scale, which Is on a diameter of the
circle, by moving the scale into the line
of the cloud's movement.
MUSICAL HITMAN RIBS.
A Norristown Lad Who Turns Him
self Into a Xylophone.
Eddl* "Warp, a Norristown lad. who
carries bobbins in one of the mills
there, has a set of musical ribs. Eddie
is very thin, and his ribs protrude dis
tinctly. The latest music is drawn
from them in the following manner:
The boy sits down and tucks his shirt
up about his neck. He takes in each
hand an empty bobbin and draws a
long breath, which throws the ribs into
the greatest prominence. With the bob
bins he then plays on them as ordinary
musicians play on xylophones, extract
ing: the tune from the right-side ribs
and the accompaniment from the left-
Bide ones. The upper ribs give the high
notes and the lower ones the low notes.
E is the key of the first or topmost rib.
and F is that at the bottom, though
Eddie Warp, by stopping of! a rib with
his fingers, as violinists stop off a
string, can raise or lower the pitch
greatly.
Eddie's music la not very loud, but it
would easily fill a concert hall. The
Urslnus Tennis Club ha* been after
him for some time, offering him large
inducements to play at one of their
musical teas, but he is modest and re
fuses to play before women, arguing
that his peculiar kind of music necessi
tates an exposure too great to be toler
ated in a mixed audience. â Philadelphia

Captain Bohen had several of the de

mitted at least a dozen burglaries dur
ing the past two weeks. Always well
Pressed ar.d clever of speech, the daring
crook has succeeded in gaining' entrance
to some of the most fashionable board
ing- houses of the city, and robbing the
guests while they were at dinner. Ac
cording to police he disdains jewelry,
evidently fearing arrest in case he at
tempted to dispose of it. and he has con
fined his efforts to finding thÂ« money of
his victims.
Last Friday evening he entered a house
at *?2 OTarrell street, and awaiting a
favorable opportunity he forced open the
door of a room occupied by a Mrs. Mal
... On the bureau were Mrs. Mallett's
jewelry and a purse containing }10. The
audacious thief did not touch the jewelry,
but took the contents of the F urs Â£- c
â ..--. leaving the room by one of the
guests in the house, who. suspecting
something wrong, proceeded to question
him. The ex-convict pretended that he
was anxious to see a woman whom he had
met the previous night, and as la expla
nation seemed satisfactory he was al
lowed to depart. A few minutes later
the burglary was discovered and the po
lice were at" once notified. Since then th*
fellow has similarly robbed several rooms
In different lodging houses, securing only
a small amount of money. Yesterday the
guest who saw him leaving the house on
O'Farreii street positively Identified his
picture which adorns the rogues' gallery.
Not-withstanding the reticence of the
police It is known that in addition to the
burglaries committed by him in this city
he is also wanted In Southern California
on a more serious charge. Whether it is
murder or not the detectives who are try
ing to apprehend him refuse to state, but
intimate that the charges of burglary
which they have against him are insig

which he is wanted in the south. * ler ."

WARS FROM TRIFLES.
Petty Quarrels That Have Brought
on Some Bloody Conflicts.
Many wars have had trifling causes.
A dispatch altered in one or two points
by Bismarck brought on the Franco-
German conflict. Palmerston said
facetiously that only three men in
Europe ever knew what the Schleswifc-
H v.stein troubles which led to the wars
were aboÂ»t, and two of them died be
fore the conflict began, while he. the
third man, had forgotten. A slighting
reference by Frederick the Great of
Prussia to Mme. Pompadour of France
was I said to have been one of the
cau=es of the seven years' war. some
times called the "war of the three
petticoats" from the fact that the
France of Pompadour and the Russia
of Catherine II joined the Austria of
Maria Theresa against Frederick.
According to John Bright. England
and her allies drifted Into the Crimean
war without realising It until after
they got in. and they did not know
what they were fighting for even after
they started, while it is certain that
evervthir.g which was supposed to have
been fixed by that results of a quarter
of a century of war beginning with
the commencement of the French Rev
olution and ending with Waterloo
"pleased nobody and settled nothing "
according to Sheridan. The average
person who lived In those day knew
as little about the causes of the
daughter as old Kaspar did about the
battle of Blenheim when questioned by
little Peterkin.
The Superior. Court of South Carolina
has* decided that a citizen of that State is
at liberty to go Into a neighboring: State
and purchase and bring back aÂ« much
liouor for his own use as he chooses.

ROSH HASHANAH TO BE
USHERED IN TO-NIGHT
Jewish New Year Will Be Observed
With Solemn Prayer by Mem
bers of the Faith. , .
"Bosh Hashanah," the Jewish new year,
will be ushered in this evening with sol
emn prayer and beautiful music in every
temple and synagogue throughout the
land. The importance of the holiday and
its significance to the Hebrews was dis
cussed yesterday for The Call by Rabbi
Jacob Nleto of Shereth Israel and Rabbi
Isadore Myers of the Ohabal Shalome
congregations. In part Dr. Xieto said:
To-morrow evening ushers In for the He. *
brew the year 5560 of the creation, as it is
called, but* which, more properly speaknlg,
should be the era of man; for the Hebrew
well knowÂ» that this number of years does
IK ; represent the duration of the earth or of
theuniverse, but rather is a computation from
the first personage met with in traditional
history. The Hebrew, does not' regard his
New Year's day with feelings of joy or cf
sorrow, but receives the day with a senti
ment which, while it If akin to both. Is
yet neither. He celebrates with joy the eve
of the day when, surrounded by his family,
he dwells mostly upon the blessings he has
enjoyed during the year past, and this with
feelings which are. at best mixed with sad
ness 0 what the new year might hold for
him and his. For early the next day he ap
pears before 1..s Maker and. recounting to
himself the history of the past twelve
months, he places his finger, as It were,
upon each peccadillo which in his opinion
would in the sight of God mar the perfect
ness of the record. He strives to brir.g
home to himself and to realize wherein he
has fallen short of that standard or morality
inculcated in him by his religion and recog
nized by his own conscience. He formu
late? the plea by which he will strive on
the day of atonement, which Is the day of
judgment, to justify or palliate his errors
of omission or commission.
Services will be held by Dr. Xieto in
Shereth Israel Synagogue, corner Taylor
and Post streets, this evening at 5:30. and
the (Sallowing morning at 9 o'clock.
The doctor will deliver a sermon at the
latter service on "The Agitation of the
Camp." A special musical programme has
been arranged for both services, and wlil
be rendered under the direction of Cantor
D. S. Davis and the choir, which is com
posed of: Frank Coffin, tenor; G. V. B.
Mills basso; Miss Nellie Flynn, soprano;
Ella V. McCloskey, alto, and Mr. Rona.
organist. ' â ~
The services this evening at the Bush
street Synagogue will commence at C
o'clock, and on Tuesday and Wednesday
mornings at S o'clock. Sermons will be
preached by Rabbi Isidore Myers on both
days about noon. On Tuesday the sub
ject of the sermon will be "The Battles of
Life " and on Wednesday a sermon in
verÂ«e on the Shophar will be redelivered
by special request. The choir has been
strengthened by the addition of eight
ladles who have volunteered their ser
vices and who have been carefully trained
by Cantor Myerson and Professor De
lipiane.
In discussing the Jewish new year.
Rabbi Myers said yesterdays
The celebration of the Jewish New Year
Is intended to emphasize some of the most
sublime ideas taught by Judaism. In the
first place it commemorates the creation of
the world and proclaims the universal sov
ereignty of the Creator, who alone governs
all nature and sways the destinies of all
nations and men. Secondly It reminds the
Jew that man Is a responsible being who
must render an account for ail his actions
to the Supreme Judge. Hence it is regarded
as the first of the days set aside for self
examination and preparation for the solemn
Day â¢â ' Atonement. And lastly, the holiest
hope and aspiration 'â ' Judaism is expressed
on the New 'Years day that the time will
ccme when all men will âledge the
only God as their Klnp. Judge and Father,
The expression of each of these three Ideas
Is accompanied by the sounding of the Shop
har, or Ram's Horn. First, it if= sounded In
jubilation proclaiming the coronation of the
heavenly Klnor. Then It sounds as an alarm,
"to awaken the sleeping and to rouse them
to repentance." And lastly, Israel's hope is
' conveyed In the third blast of the traditional
Phoptiar, which was first heard on Sinai
when the law Â«aÂ« given, and to be heard
again throughout the world wnen universal
liberty and peace will be proclaimed among
the children of our universal Father.
THEIR NAMES.
The Old Nurse's Answer to an Ad
mirer's Query.
The story of that proud mother who
named her twin pirl babies "Kate" and ;
"Duplicate" baa been eclipsed by an In- j
cident in the life of a pair of Washington
twins v. hich a well known raconteur |
vouches for as absolutely correct. The j
fond parents of a lovely pair of twin
babies employed a motherly old Irish
woman to nurse them. The other day she
took them out for a carriage ride In
Franklin square. The babies are bright
and pretty and always attract tire atten- I
tion of passers-by. As they sat cooing
and billing In the sun a young woman who

TAXPAYERS OPPOSE
AN EXTRA SESSION
Agitation Emanates From the
Political Bureau of the
Southern Pacific,
Herrin and Burns May Compel the Gov-
ernor to Issue the Proclamation,
Alleged Supporters of a Caucus.
THE sentiment of the taxpayers of
California as expressed through
the newspapers and the utterances
of public men Is against an extra
session of the Legislature. The
plea that the Vrooman act must be re
vised before street work can be carried
forward is a mere subterfuge to give the
Governor a shadow of Justification for
calling together the members. Every per
eon of ordinary intelligence comprehends
that the real purpose of the proposed spe
cial session Is to bring about the election
of Burns to the United States Senate.
A few weeks after the regular session
adjourned the managers of the political
'bureau of the Southern Pacific began a
canvass of the Stato to ascertain how
many members of the Legislature would
agree to go Into caucus provided the Gov
ernor would call an extra session this fall.
At first the canvass was conducted with
much cunning and sagacity. Many mem
bers supposed that the agent making the
inquiry was a representative of tnlÃ pa
per. The general tenor of interviews con
vinced, the railroad agents that the mem
bers would be glad to assemble in Sacra
mento again and draw down a weekly al
lowance from the State treasury, but they
would not agree to support Burns for Sen
ator and neither would they consent to
sign a pledge to go into caucus.
The Southern Pacific and the Mexican
were not elated over the result of the
canvass and the subject .was referred to
Judge Dibble for further consideration.
subsequently there was quite a round-up
of Senators and Assemblymen at Dibble's
office in the Mills building, and the word
was passed out that sixty-one members
would agree to go Into caucus. When
the Governor was consulted he refused to
consider anything but written pledges.
This did not discourage the extra session
advocates, as they insisted that Herrin
and Burns would take the Governor in
hand and command him to call the ses
sion. Here the matter rests for the pres
ent. Burns and Her Yin have not yet
tietmed it advisable to force the Gover
nor's hand. They are not convinced that
Hums could win in the caucus.
A well informed member of the Le3is'a
n;rc who has closely studied the attitude
of legislators on the subject and whose
position enables him to obtain what is
railed inside information estimates that
thirty-nine members have agreed to go
lino caucus in the event of a. special ses
sion. There are twenty-six Republicans
In the Senate and fifty-nine in the Assem
bly, making a total of eighty-five. The
number of votes in the Legislature neces
sary for a choice, assuming that all the
members attend, is sixty-one. The record
of a leading ballot on the- last day of the
repulur session is thus given:

! Elizabeth Virginia Reihm are daughters 'of Mathias Reihm, well <$
* -*- known on the Comstocs in the "days of gold," then proprietor of a i
f machine shop in San Francisco and now a prominent foundryman in Virginia
The sisters Grace, Elizabeth and Nellie Osgood Reihm were known in this f
city as "The Three Graces." They were born and educated here and have i
a host of friends in the community.
Elizabeth remained with her father and last July was married to Fred *
* Williams, a well-known mining man of Bodie. She and her husband spent *'
their moneymoon in California and are now permanently located in Bodie. <>
âº Grace and Nellie went to Australia some time ago to join their aunt, <>
Â«âº Maggie Moore of "Struck Oil" fame. The girls expressed an earnest desire <>
to go on the stage, and when the Maggie Moore-Harry Roberts Dramatic 1
Company was formed for a tour of the world Grace and Nellie Reihm were
f engaged as members of the troupe. Another stage struck member of the com- J
* jiiiny was Fred Ewnelton Bryant, the son of a wealthy ranch-owner in f
P Australia. Fred and Gracie became great friends during the early portion of 4"
âº the tour, and when the company reached Auckland, N. /.., they decided to â¦
t> get married.
The ceremony was performed in St. Benedict's Church, Auckland, and
Mrs J Conroy of San Francisco, aunt of the Misses Rcihm, gave the bride
9 away. Miss Nellie Rtihm was the maid of honor and Percy Ward, a well- T
* known member of the theatrical profession, was host man. After the cere- J
7 mony tht-ro was a wedding h'feakfast at which seventy invited guests were <S>
âº present. The happy couple went away on a short honeymoon and then with â¦
* the other members of the company sailed on the mail steamer Alameda for 1
Honolulu. The Moore-Roberts Company is now In Hawaii and will arrive
here on the Australia on the 12th inst., when Mrs. Bryant's many frienda
[ will have a chance to congratulate her.

Tuolunane, Mellck, Merritt, Muenter, Hadcllft,
Kaub, Raw, liobtnsou, Yuleutlne, Wadeâ total,
30.
The CalTs information differs slightly
from the estimate presented by the mem
ber of the Legislature who pave the fore
going figures. for example. Senator
Smith of Ivern, who is classed i
a caucus, "if Burns has any apparent
chance," should lie placed In the â¢
with those agreeing to go into caucus.
This change would add one more vote to
the caucus class, making a total of 40.
The placing of the names of Senators
Morehouse and Cutter in the caucus class
will cause a deal of comment. The Call
believes that an error of classification has
bet-n n-.ade in respect to these two B
tors. As far as can be ascertained neither
one has given an expression to indicate a
change of base on the Senatorial question.
Should a caucus of sixty-one be permit
ted to settle the question of Senatorship
by a vote of a majority (31), Burns might
become the caucus nominee, although lie
could not go before the people and carry
a single Assembly district in California.
Should the entire eighty-five elect to go
into caucus the followers of the Mexican
would bo compelled to rally forty-three
votes.
The safe policy for reputable, members
of the Legislature to pursue is to have
nothing whatever to do with caucus
pledges and extra session petitions. When
the Legislature adjourned there was a
great Bigh of relief that the State had
lie. -ii saved from the disgrace of Burns'
election to the United Slates Senate. The
vacancy at this time is an honor to Call- !
fornia. and it Is so highly creditable to the
Republicans of the State that the people
at the next pen^ral election will give the
party that resisted the dictation of the
Southern Pacific a vote of renewed confi
dence.
Should H^rrin and Burns force the Gov
ernor to call an extra session it will th<=>n
be the duty of all good Republicans and i
Democrats to attend and defeat the elec
tion of Burns, even if another deadlock
be the outcome of the second battle in
behalf of the people. No doubt efforts
will be made to induce Democrats to stay
away from Sacramento, so that the num
ber of votes necessary to a choice may be
reduced to the smallest martin under tin
law.
A quorum could be maintained in either
house if all the Democrats absented them
selves. In that case a majority of the
eighty-five remaining Republicansâforty
three membersâ might elect a Senator. It
was known to The Call last winter that
j two or three Democrats in the Legisla
ture stood ready to vote for Burns in the
event of a Hmall acquisition being only
i;ei es=ary to determine the issue in his
favor. There is no certainty that Burns
would be the nornim f the caucus if
one should be held, but citizens having
regard for the fair name of the E
would feel a sense of danger when they
perceived that the question was tv be de
termined in secret caucus.
There was not the slightest apprehen
sion during the regular session that the
railroad's candidate could win in the open
although Huntington. Herri n and t!.-!r
agents in every county of the State em
ployed their energies and influence to se
cure support for Burns. The hint is now
thrown out that Burns is not tho candi
date of the parties s^e^intr to tiring about
an extra session of the Legislature. Mem
bers are posted in say that the Repub
licans will settle the issue in caucus and
whoever receives the majority vote of all
those attending the caucus will hp d< -
dared the party nominee. The railroad
agents who were employed to canvass the
were careful to avoid the mention
of Burns' name when addressing inquiries
to supporters of Grant, Barnes and Scott.

An extra session may open the floodgates of
extravagance and squander some thousands of
the people's money. The promise of 61 mem

Burns, however, and a special session may be
convened only to repeat the deadlock which
lasted throughout the entire regular session.

less so to the Republican jiarty.

PAINTERS' NEW SCHEDULE
Large Number of Shops Have
Agreed to Put It in Force
To- Morrow.
A week ago the Painters 1 and Decorat
ors' Union, No. 73, formulated and adopt
ed a schedule of $3 per day of eight
hours, to go into effect on September 5.
This was presented to the Building: Trades
Council and approved and indorsed, and
a special business agent, O. H. Stocks,
was appointed to visit the master painters
of the city and request their concession to
the schedule, A circular letter had first
been forwarded to them, setting forth the
reasons for and the Justice of the de
mand.' ' â  â¢ . , .. . . .
The business agent has reported that he
has been remarkably successful, not only
receiving favorable assent but also the
good wishes for success from the follow
ing reputable firms of San Francisco:

The Building Trades Council has ex
tended to the firms named its sincere
thanks, and it has expressed the hope that
their example will be speedily followed by
other employers, particularly one or two
bosses who feel that a hardship has been
worked on them by so-called previous
contracts. The Building Trades < ounoil
has considered this matter thoroughly
and finds thai it is within the bounds of
right and justice that all should be dealt
with alike. The men are therefore in
structed to report for work at the above
mentioned shops at their usual time Tues
day morning.

TO BE A DAY
OF DAYS FOR
UNION LABOR
Great Celebration at
Glen Park.
AN ELABORATE PROGRAMME
ANNUAL HOLIDAY OF THE
ORGANIZED WORKMEN.
Exercises, Games, Dancing, Music
and a Parade of Unions With.
Their Colors and Color
Guards.
Elaborate arrangements have been
made for the proper celebration of Labor
day, and this morning all- true union men
will turn their faces toward Glen Park
and join the crowd that will surely be
there.
The active portion of the celebration
will begin at 1 o'clock, at which time
there will be a review of the unions of the
city and of the State; at 2 there will be
literary exercises; at 3 there will be an
entertainment to last until half past 3;
tht n the games will commence. At 5 the
prises will be announced and awarded.
The review of unions will be a novelty.
A silver cup, donated by Mayor Phelan,
will be awarded to the union making the
best display, marching with its colors.
The colors of a union consist of the na
tional flag and the union banner bearing
upon it the name of the union, the date
of its charter and other kindred informa
tion. The color guard consists of not less
than twenty-four members of the union,
and may run up to the full membership.
These colors and color guards will be
paraded at the celebration at Glen Park
at 1 o'clock. The union winning the cup
will be allowed to hold it for a year, and
it will finally go to the union winning it
on three consecutive Labor days. Much
interest is being shown in the event.
The literary exercises will include an
opening address by the president of the
day, P. H. McCarthy, president of the
Federated Trades. Following him will
be an address by P. M. Weliin and an ad
dress by A. R. Andre, besides several
selections by fhe band. The entertain
ment will include a song by Maude Mul
lery; some Irish witticisms by Ed Carter;
some tricks of legerdemain by Bob Lee,
and a song by R. S. Duncan.
! The games are to be one of the most in
teresting features of the afternoon. There
are all kinds of races, and races scheduled
for all kinds of people. Age or weight will
be no bar, nor will sex or social condition.
There will be races for girls and for boys;
for young women and young men; for
married women and married men; for fat
WO*men and fat men. Then there will he
three-legged races, egg races and bicycle
races. There will be an amateur race for
the Labor day medal, a cross-country bi
cycle race for the Glen Park cup. a fine
piece of crystal offered by the park; a
hose coupling contest by members of the
Fire Department, a tug-of-war between
members of the different unions and a
cakewalk.
When the races have been run the ath
letes will give way to the dancers, and
until every one has had enough Professor
McCarthy will keep his pipes going for
the exponents of the jig and reel. The
dancers will not have to dance, for the fun
of it. for there will be several good prizes
for the most proficient. A cross-country
run for the whole crowd, with a $15 prize
for the ono coming in first, will wind up
the outdoor sports.
The prizes for the field contests include
everything, from a box of c:imly or a bot
tle of "pood stuff'" to medals and cups.
No money will be awarded in any of the
contests except the hose coupling match,
for the sports will ho strictly amateur all
through.
The day will be observed by the city as
a legal holiday. The schools, the omVes
of the city government, the banks and
many of the business houses will be
closed, besides every place where union
labor is employed. It is the intention to
make this celebration a more extensive
one than any that has been attempted.

cises are as follows:

Opinion of the Building Trades
Council Over the Governor's
Last Appointment.
The Building Trades Council has jn\noci
the long list of those who have no love
to spare for the Governor of this State
The council la outspoken over the way iii
which organized labor has been ignored in
the selection of a man for the position ot
Labor Commissioner, and it has outlined
for itself a policy of retaliation that may
bear fruit for the Governor, should he
again attempt to spread his political
wings and soar high over his own head
The ideas of the council are expressed in
the following preamble and resolutions:
Whereas, Governor Gage on August 2* an
pointed F. V. Meyers to the office of Labor
CommfsHloner and In so doing violated his
voluntary ante-election pledge that this Im
portant department should be committed to
the care of a representative of labor- and
