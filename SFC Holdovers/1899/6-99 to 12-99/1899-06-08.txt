SAN RAFAEL, June 7.â The strange
disap] "f Peter Lorraine
is still an unsolved mystery, and
the authorities of Marin County
are Inured to the belief that an-
other foul prime lies hidden in the
tangled depths of Carson Canyon, the
"black hole of Marin." James Dier,
the missing man's â¢â¢;il>in mate, who was
I m tne Ctounty Jail here yester
-51 i ; rr faylor "n suspicion of
having murdered Lorraine, vehemently
lims his Innocence, but as he has
iy told several < ontradictory
ling his knowledge of
"French Pete's" .lisapp<? ; iiHnce, Sheriff
Taylor is now Btrongly convinced that
Dler kii"\\s more than he dares to tell.
All day residents from the
little towns in the vicinity of Enos'
lumher camp, where Lorraine and his
suspected murderer were employed,
flocked int.. the gloomy canyon and
Bcarched the thick umkTbrush in the
\,<in hope of finding the missing wood
chopper*s '
The doubt as to whether it was Mon
day, May 1, 'â ;â  the day following that
Lorraine was last seen alive was dis
pelled to-day by Savine Johnson and
Joe McCarthy, two woodchoppers who
worked for John Bnos cutting timber
on the Maillard tract Both McCarthy
and Johnson are convinced that Lor
raine disappeared on Tuesday, May 2,
as the evening before they saw him rid
ing "n the timber dray with John Bnos,
the eighteen-year-old son of the over
of the camp. The incidents of tho
ride are still firmly impressed on young
Enos' memory, and when the two
: choppers called hia attention to it
terday he vividly recalled the cir
cumstances connected with the ride and
stated that h-- was fully satisfied that
it was the last time anybody in the
ramp â save perhaps Buspeci T >i( r â had
Lorraine alive, foung Enos had
b< en far up Into the head of the gloomy
canyon that day. and on his return
home in the evening he met Lorraine
walking along the road toward hi
cabin, which is situated about a mile
above the main camp. The man
. d unusually happy and he chatted
with Enos about a place he had dis
covered where the timber was of an
exceptionally fine quality. When they
arrived abreast of the woodchopper's
..bin Lorraine grot off the wagon
and invited Knos inside to have a
smoke and a drink of wine. The young
man readily accepted his fellow work
man's invitation and together they
-went into the cabin. James Dier, who
i] led the adjoining room of the
cabin, had not returned from his day's
labor and the pair sat talking over
their
Thi- v Ichopper had been to Enr*'
csjbin the Sunday previous to purchase
some flour, and while they were seated
there Lorraine t<>l<l the young man that
he Intended to bake his weekly supply
of bread thru evening. When EnÂ«>s
left Dler was commencing to busy him
self preparing his Bupper. That "was
perhaps the l;^st time Lorraine was
seen alive to tin tx Bi of young Enos'
knowledge, and ))â¢â¢ is absolutely certain
that nobody else in the camp save his
murderer â if h<- was murderedâ caw the
missing woodchopper after he did on
that eveninK. i
When Slvr.fr Taylor opened Lor
raine's cabin yesterday before he placed
Dier under arresi he found evidence in
the shap-- of several loaves of baked
bread, which bears out young Bnos*
story.
There is not a sln>;i,- man in the
Mh()le lumber camp who entertains any
theory other than the one that "French
Pete" was foully murdered by a cow
ardly assassin. The excitement over
th<- startling developments of yester
day is quite Intense. The several bloody
murders that have <><â¢< nrred in Carson
Canyon and gone unpunished have ag
gravated the residents of the county to
th" extreme, and it is the avowed in
tention of Sheriff Taylor and the sub
The San Francisco Call.
<
ordinate authorities to sift Lorraine's,,
disappearance to the bottom.
The many suspicious circumstances,
connected with French Pete's disap
pearance make it highly improbable,
so Sheriff Taylor says, that the wood
chopper has absented himself volun
tarily. In the first place it is argued'
that he would not have bought the 4
Sour to make his bread had he decided'
to leave the camp, and in thr- second*
I place he was without funds, and there-Â«
fore could not have secured transpcrta-4
; tion on the railroad. Then again. Lor- â¢
raine had a pet cat at his cabin, and
' his fellow workmen say that he would
not have left camp without his pet
feline under any circumstances. The
cat still hovers' clone to his missing
. master's late abode. While The < "all re
porter and artist were standing at the
door of the cabin to-day the cat scram
bled down from the side of the canyon,
plaintively meowing at every step. His
gaunt sides and lean limbs and general
ly emaciated appearance showed thai
Lorraine's pet had not been fed since
I his master disappeared. The missing
man's clothing and personal effects
were found in the cabin, indicating that
their owner had no Intention of leav
ing. The most Important find, which
j bears out the theory that Lorraine has
been foully dealt with, was his tobacco
pouch, filled with tobacco. Had he pre
meditated departure from the camp he
would have surely taken this with him.
I as Lorraine was an inveterate smoker
land tobacco Is a Bcarce commodity in
the depths of Marin County's "Black
Hole."
The detectives whom Thief Lees
promised to send to the assistance "i
Sheriff Taylor did not arrive this morn
ing as expected, so th>- proposed trip to
the camp was postponed until to-mor
row. Sheriff Taylor went over t,, the
city early in the afternoon to consult
with Chief Lees. The Sheriff is some
what of a detective himself and he in
tends to devote all of his time to fer
reting out the mystery.
"Everybody in the canyon believes
that Pete has been murdered," said
! Savin Johnson, one of the woodchop
'. pera who saw Lorraine on the wagon
! with young Enos. "His absence was
! not noted immediately, as re some
times do not see each other up in this
country for weeks at a time. One day
my partner and myself were talking
about Lorraine's disappearance, when
Dier jumped up and excitedly ex
j claimed, 'What are you worrying about
1 Pete for? It is not any of your busi-
Q< BS if a man goes away.' "
"I am sure that Pete has not been
murdered," said James Dier to a Call
reporter who visited him to-day at the
BA^ FRANCISCO, TIIX T KSDAY, JUNE 8, 1899.
HIS PARTNER JAILED
FOR KILLING HiM.
; jail. "If he has I had nothing to do
| with it. He had a quarrel with John
Enos, the boss of the camp, but I don t
think it was serious enough to lead to
bloodshed. I saw him last either Mon
day or Tuesday in the first week of
May. Pete was a sickly fellow, and I
think if you look in the hospitals you
will find him. Previous to my being
employed by Enos I worked for a man
I named Miles, who keeps a ranch near
; Suisun."
During the interview Dier shifted his
sharp blue eyes from side to side and
appeared very nervous. When asked
where he lived previous to his coming
to California Dier meditated a minute,
as if lust for an answer, and then he
replied, "I lived in Oregon."
When Sheriff Taylor reminded Dier
I that he did not appear to be telling the
truth the suspect blurted out defiantly,
"Well, 1 don't have to tell you, any
way."
Dier's knowledge in this respect led
the Sheriff to- believe that he had been
arrested before, as a man who lives in
the woods all his life rarely knows that
he is not compelled to make a state
ment before his prelimin: â â¢- examina
tion. Sheriff Taylor asked Dier if he
had ever been arrested before, and he
took refuge in the reply, "No. not for
any crime."
Sheriff Taylor pressed the prisoner for
a more definite answer, and he jumped
up excitedly from the cot on which he
was seated and sought refuge in the
adjoining cell, thus ending the Inter
\ View.

The Call.
Despiie the military censorship
something that has rather more
ihe semblance of truth than any
thing that has been sent out so
far, is beginning to come from
the Coeur d Alenes.
There are two sides to the
story of the mining troubles
there. It appears labor leaders
assert that the Miners' Union has
not been always and altogether to
blame. General Merriam, accord
ing to the labor side of the story,
has gone greatly beyono even what
military necessity would maicaie
in the suppression of riot A gen
eral order to shoot down men if
they should seek to escape death
by fire can hardly be justified by
anything that has occurred in
Idaho so far.
BOISE. Idaho, June 7.â W. J. Walker,
editor of the Freeman's labor journal
and an organizer fur Western labor,
tells a pretty tough story concerning
General Merriam and (lovernor Steuv.
enhorp;'? military rule in the Coeur
d'Alene country. Mr. Walker, being one
of the principal leaders in labor mat
ters in the Northwest, is kept posted
on the progress of affairs in the Coeur
d'Alenes. and he says he knows where
of he speaks in the assertions he
makes.
"The manner in which things are
jdone in the Coeur d'Alenes under the
pretended authority of martial law is
scandalous. It is worse. It is a dis
grace to the American Government,"
said Mr. AValker in an interview to
day.
"I will tell you a few things that have
been done under the orders of General
Merriam, which I am assured <m the
highest authority are absolutely true.
I am Informed that the inquest held on
the pretended remains of James Smith,
th" union miner who was said to have
been killed, was held on a coffin full
i if nicks. The military could not get
possession of the body, and knowing
no one would dare to raise a question
as to what was in the box, they filled
a coffin with rocks and proceeded to
hold an inquest on the assumption that
the proceedings would stand any way.
"During the inquest they went to the
wife of one of the miners in the 'bull
pen' and made her induce her husband
to give evidence. The woman was in a
delicate condition. They knew she
needed the attention of her husband,
and told her the only way she could
secure his release was for him to give
evidence for the Government. They
told her they intended to hang ;it least
fifty men under any circumstances, and
the only way she could save her hus
band was by making him tell what he
knew. The woman, thoroughly fright
ened, went to her husband, but he was
innocent of having done any wrong and
was not afraid of the threats. He re
fused to have anything to say and tried
to allay her fears, but did not succeed.
The strain was too much for the sick
woman. She went home, was taken
critically ill, and the chances, I am in
formed, are greatly against her recov
ery. This placed that man in just this
position: He was required to swear to
a lot of lies to save his wife's life.
"In another case a disinterested < iti
zen was arrested as a witness. He had
seen men who took part in the demon
stration in which the Bunker Hill and
Sullivan mills were destroyed, and us
he occupied a neutral position he told
the officers when arrested that he knew
eight or ten of the men well enough to
identify them, which he would do. * Ac
cordingly a squad of fifty men were
marched out. He was unable to recog
nize any of them, and another fifty was
brought out. He knew none of these,
and thirty-live more were marched out.
Afunn he was unable to pick out a man
he remembered, and told the officers to
keep marching them out, and if there
were any he remembered he would
identify them, but because he had not
been able to recognize any of those he
had seen they came to the conclusion
that he did not want to identify any
one, and threw him into the 'bull
pen, 1 where he still remains. With him
it was a case of identifying some one
whether he knew him or not or go to
jail.
"One day a fire started in the 'bull
pen.' One of the men smoking had
dropped a spark into the straw given
the men to sleep on, and knowing tht
danger there was of a recurrence of
such a fire, the men asked the officer in
charge to report to General Merriam
and ask to have better water facilities
put in. In response Merriam issued an

PARIS, June 7.â Mme. Drey
fus has received the following
telegram from her husband:
"Leave Friday. Await with
joy moment I kiss you."
â¢ FORT DE FRANCE, Martinique, (via
Hayti), June 7. â Although Captain
Dreyfus continues t<i maintain his
usual Impassive attitude he has de
cided to resume wearing his uniform of
an artillery captain on debarking from
the French cruiser Sfax at Brest.
It has been impossible to obtain an
interview with the famous prisoner,
who is now under guard of Captain
Cacheux of the gendarmerie and Fourth
( Gendarmes.
Dreyfus seems to be in good health,
although his features are somewhat
drawn. His face, after the first mani
festation of joy at the moment when he
received notification of the judgment of
the Court of Cassation, resumed an as
pect of tranquility and impassivity,
nor has he since betrayed any sign of
either joy or anxiety. He is perfectly
mute on the subject of the new court
martial with his guard, and he does
not seem to be preoccupied with any
thing else than his wife and children.
He has responded to the telegram of
congratulation from his wife, express
ing his great joy in the thought that
he will senn embrace their children
and members of the Dreyfus family
again. There was not a word in the
dispatch about the uew trial. Since
the gendarmes under Captain Cacheux,
in the name of the military authorities,
have accepted the custody of the pris
oner the He dv Diable ha,s been with
drawn from the control of the prison
administration and by a decree of M.
Mouttet, Governor of Cayenne, it has
been declared military territory. The
verdict of the Court of Cassation ha.s
caused a very favorable impression in
Martinique and in French Guiana.
ZOLA TO WRITE NOVEL
ON THE DREYFUS CASE
LONDON, June 7.â The St. James
Gazette publishes an interview between
its Paris correspondent and M. Emile
Zola, in the course of which M. Zola
is reported as having said:
"I have entered the lists. I am a
gladiator. I am fighting a great fight,
which is by no means ended. 1 cannot
write anything until the case is over,
but then I intend to write a novel on
the Dreyfus affair, summing it all up
land drawing from it additional conclu
j sions which cannot be clearly and con
; yincingly stated yet.
"This is my duty. I do not intend
to seek any financial advantage in per
forming it. i am perfectly safe here in
Paris, for, despite the nonsensical state
ments of some anti-Dreyfusard papers,
it is impossible to arrest me. We shali
see whether a French jury will again
! condemn me for speaking the truth. I
intend to appeal against the verdict of
the Versailles court and then the whole
j matter will go before another jury. I
i do not think there will be a complete
solution before the end of the summer.
The innocence of Dreyfus has been
recognized, but there are certain guilty
persons who must be punished, if
France is to recover her self-respect." ]

to-night, from Bluefields via the steam
ship Sunniva, which sailed from that
I port on June 1, Nicaragua and Costa
Rica are on the brink of war. The
Times-Democrat correspondent, under
date of the Sunniva's sailing, writes:
"The other day Torres left Bluefields
for the interior, via San Juan del Norte,
with 165 soldiers and forty-one pris

the San Juan River, where that river
passes through Costa Rican territory,
and up which stream it was necessary
to : go. in .order to reach Managua, re

terior to report the matter to Zelaya..
As yet no action has been taken.

nificance to a gathering held in Blue
fields on Tuesday, May 30, . when Gen

palace of the merchants . and business
men: of'. Bluefields. '.In opening the
meeting he read a telegram from Presi
dent Zelaya, wherein it was stated that
j it was. the purpose of the Government
to retire all : the paper money and to
put- the country upon a silver basis.
The general then proceeded to explain'
that it would be .necessary to raise |
1,000,000 soles on the Atlantic coast. He
said he had called the meeting to con
sult with the business men of the coast
and . to get their advice as, to how the
money- could â  be raised. He. expects to
raise the loan from the merchants, and
has given them until Thursday, at 2 p.
m. to think the matter over. and give
.their answer. It is said the Nicaraguan
Government is retiring paper money at
the rate of 30,000 to 40.000 soles a month.
The demand for silver money is be
lieved to be created by the pending war.
j Nicaragua needs munitions, and her
paper money will be worthless outside
I of her own boundaries."

LOS ANGELES. June V.â Senator Balls
and Assemblyman L. H. Valentin'' resent
with considerable heat a recent statement
that in the event of an extra session they
would vote for D. M. Burns. The same
statement also had Assemblyman N. P.

Bulla has received several offers of sup
port should he desire to be again a can

In conversation to-day Bulla inclined to
the opinion that there might be some
ground for the recent talk of an extra
session. He based his statements upon
the public withdrawal of U. S. Grant from
the Senatorial contest, a-suming Grant to
have been correctly quoted in recent In

event of an extra session the largest part
of the Los Angeles County delegation,
now that General Barnes has withdrawn

San Francisco regarding the departure of
troops for Manila:
"Jen will send a battalion of the Fourth

General Shafter replied he would send
two companies of the Fourteenth. 200 men
of the Fourth Cavalry and 1300 recruits
on the Sheridan.
General Scfawan, who was recently or

RULING WHICH WILL
SILENCE CRITICISM
XKW YORK. June 7.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: President
McKlnlev has put an interpretation on
one of the paragraphs of his recent civil
service order which removes one of the
principal grounds on which criticism has
been based. The President's order
amends rul< S of the Civil Service regu
lations by adding this language:
"All persons serving under temporary
appointments at the date of approval of
this section may be permanently ap
pointed, in the discretion of proper ap
pointing office."
The general construction given to thia
amendment was that it would permit the
transfer to the classified service of all
persons given temporary appointments
under the increase of force made neces
sary by the war with Spain.
Secretary Gape brought the matter up
in the Cabinet meeting yesterday, and
the President said the temporary appoint
ments effected were only such as bad
been made r " till places in the classified
Bervlce for which the Civil Service Com
mission had no t â ligibie iist and could cer
tify candidates. There are few such
places, and the amendment therefore af
fects only a handful ol persons.2
NEW CATHOLIC CHURCH FOR TOMALES.

most beautiful and expensive
churches in the Interior of tht>
State is now being erected in
this town for the Catholics under the
pastoral charge < f Rev. John Etodgers.
The site was donated by Mrs. James

Si~;a: Dispatch to The Call
SAN DIEGO, June 7.âNotwithstand
ing th^ excitement
â  ra during the past two weeks
the lack of definite news from r<
Americans at the camp has caused
many Intending prospectors t<> defer the
trip to the diggings until it was learned
beyond a doubt that gold -xisted there
in paying quantities. This news has
now come. Th>> steamer St. Denis,
which took seventy from
here to San Rogue Landing, leaving
San Diego last Friday night, stopped
â  â ff Sa!i Quintin bar this afternoon on
her way back to take on passei
and mail for Ensenada. She was met
on the bar by the power schooner Santa
Barbara, which returned to San Quin
tin late this evening, the St. Denis re
turning to Ensenada.
The report bnmght back from thi
Denis is that Ed t;,.inez is sending
Beven pounds of gold from th.- cam]
the Lower California Development
Company, and that the steamer is
bringing a total of nearly forty pounds
of dust and nuggets to Ensenada. As
was t'i be expected the first full re
ports by practical people do not justify
a rush by "tenderfoots," but confirm
\h* fact that there is uold in sufficient
quantities to pay practical miners. One
very level headed individual gives it as
his opinion that $G to $10 in gold may
be taken out every day. This Is very
â¢ rvative.
Andres Strickroth of lbs & Co., En
senada, who is returning on the St.
Denis from the placers, says in his
â  â pinion the placers axe all right and
there is lots of guld there. He, too,
made the statement that it is very un
wise for persons without experience or
â¢ not properly outfitted to expect
big returns.
Tt was Impossible for the Santa Bar
bara to obtain details from the St.
I 'â¢ nls, as a rouph s^a prevented board
ing the steamer outside San Quintin,
but full particulars and reports of the
amount of ?old taken out by various
persons will be obtained to-morrow
upon the arrival of the St. Denis at
Ensenada. Mail from the mines is be
ing brought to this city on the steamer.
The Mexican Government has in
structed the Collector of the Port at
Ensenada to grant all vessels bound
for Asuncion or San Rogue landings a
quirk dispatch, thus doing away with
the necessity of asking the Government
at the City of Mexico for a permit in
each instance.
The schooner Negus, which sailed
from here last night with fifty passen
rits for the mines, arrived at Ense
nada to-night and the schooner^ Alta
;ind Rambler are expected there to
morrow morning. The schooner Anita
arrived at San Rogue Landing last
Monday with forty prospectors from
San Diego.

occurred, to shoot down every man who
tried to get out. Now, just consider the
result if a bad fire should occur. The
prisoners would have to remain and be
burned or be shot to death trying to
save their lives, for the soldiers would
obey orders. Can you imagine a more
barbarous order to be issued by a civil

Order That Displeases Attaches of
Insane Asylums.
STOCKTON. June 7.â Secretary Car
rero of the State Lunacy Commission has
won his point and the attendants at the
State Hospital for the Insane must put
on uniforms. Attaches of the local Insti
tution have been trying to get exemption
from the order ever since it was first
promulgated, and were assisted In the
.ffort by Dr. Clark, the superintendent.
The objections proved unavailing.
To-day a letter came stating that the
regulation of the Lunacy Commission
must be complied with forthwith. Male
attendants must wear a gray uniform
and women a blue dress with a nurse
tape. The expense of the new outfits
mum be borne by the attaches. So strong
are the objections by lome that they may
resign. Others accept the decision good
naturedly, and say they expect next to
see the doctors around in some kind of
official dress.

WITNESSES TO
PROVE AN ALIBI
Defense of the Alleged
Slayers of Fountain.
special Dispatch to The Call.
HILLSBORO, N. Mex., June 7.âCollo
quies between attorneys as the result of
the remarks of Attorney Catron taken
as personal by the defense and numerous
objections by Patron to the evidence made â 
the opening of the defense of Lee and [
Gllliland, charged with murdering the \
Fountains, decidedly animated. The court j
intimated contempt proceedings if it was i
repeated.
George Curry, former Speaker of the Terri
torial House of Representatives and captain
of the First United States Volunteer Cavalry,
Roosevelt's Rough Riders, was Called first,
but objection to the most important part of
his evidence was sustained. It -was that while
acting as agent of Governor Otero in the
Fountain investigation, a confession was ob- j
tamed from "Slick" Miller thai he and two 1
others, not the defendants, had planned, the
Fountain and three other murders. Witness
told of a conversation with .lack Maxwell,
who said he was with Lee, Gilliland and Mc-
New at Lee's ranch the night of Fountain's
murder. Cross-examination brought out an in
debtedness of witness to 1.c.-. but this had not
been mentioned by the latter. Hud Smith,
who was Maxwell's former employer, said
Maxwell had told him the same thing.
Joe Morgan, a wealthy gtockgrower, saw the j
defendants at Lee's Dog Canyon ranch the day j
'â :" the murder. Several attempts V 1 impeach i
the witnesses failed, but brought out some
friendship and business relations of the wit
nesses and. defendants. Maxwell was used by
the prosecution after being brought in under at
tachment, and is yet held in custody.
The defense this afternoon Introduced testi
mony to the effect that the defendants up to
sundown on the day of the murders were
sixty miles from the scene of the murder.
It was testified by witnesses, who were not
shaken by cross-examination, that the tracks
said to have been measured at Colonel Foun
tain's last camps were made by Marchers who
arrived before [Llewellyn and others, who
claim to have made measurements.
Tom Tucker, Dee's foreman, who was sum
moned by Governor Thornton and assisted In
the investigation of the Fountain murder, shod
Lee's horse and says he could recognize the
trail. He will be asked to do this later.
Attorney Catron examined the witness as to
several fights in which he had engaged. lie
admitted having killed several men, but
claimed it was done in self-defense against
great odds or while he was an officer. In one
case, witness and Lee, with three others, faced
and routed a gang of eighteen men, killing
John Qoode.
Paublino Balcorte, Pedro Gonzales and Jacob
Chaves testified that they were members of
the searching party that llrst reached Foun
tain's buckboard after the murder. Only Al
bert Fountain had been there. He left a note
for his brother to follow his trail. These wit
nesses say there were no tracks- save where
horses had been unhitched, and small tracks
which some thought were those of a deer and
some of a child's heel. Gonzales wore high
heeled cowboy boots and before Llewellyn's
party had arrived the sand was well trampled.
This party trailed Albert Fountain, returned
in a few hours, and found Llewellyn's party
there, and BrannlÃan measuring some tracks.
("'haves believed one track they saw measured
was his own pr Gonzales'.
A. N. Bailey, an employe of Lee. testified
he was at Dog Canyon Ranch, sixty miles east
from the scene of the murder, on February l,
when the murders were committed, and the
defendants were with him.
Joe Fltchett testified be was at Dog Canyon
on the day of the murder, and paw Leo riding
off to the east at 2 p. m. He saw no armed
men at Wildy Well's ranch February 6, as De
tective Clausen testified he had seen. "
Dan Fitchett testified he had a contract to
deliver a herd of cattle and the cattle which,
it had been claimed, were used to obliterate
the trail Llewellyn's party was following were
those driven by him. He had seen Lee, Gilli
land and McNew at Dog Canyon near sundown

HAS A CURE FOR
CONSUMPTION
Crotte Before American
Medical Men.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 7.â At to-day's
session of the American Medical Associa
tion a sensational report was presented on
the cure of consumption by Francisque
Crotte, the eminent and widely known
chemist of Paris, France. Mr. Crotte has
cured more than 1000 hopeless consump
tion cases, and in support of his statement
he has offered to treat and cure gratis 500
consumptives from the different States in
the Union. He comes 10 America with the
highest credentials from the most emi
nent physicians and the press in Europe,
who verify the truth of his statements.
The treatment is very scientific and
consists of Inhalations of formaldehyde
vapor, transported directly through the
tissues by the aid of light tension siatie
electricity. He is establishing a sanita-
I rium at Pekin, 111., and clinics at New
STork, Chicago and Los Angeles. Much
; interest was manifi stcd in the report, and
â  many of the physicians immediately took
pains to interview Dr. Crotte more closely
or his discovery, A number of eminent
; physicians expressed ;li> opinion that an
, absolute cure for tuberculosis had at last
I cci, found.
Daniel Brower's address proved to be
; the feature, of the day. He treated ol
i the medical aspects of crime. He calltd
attention to the rapid increase of crime,
Intemperance, ineffective laws and un
reasonable application being (::â¢<! as
reasons. Regarding the medical treatment
of crime, he said the propagation should
be stopped, marriage should be regulated
and an operation wis advocated. High li
c< nsi was upheld is the bi st means of
limiting the traffic in liquor. Reform in
judicial methods and indeterminate sen
ten< es were also advocated.
The committee on legislation recom
mended that a special committee be ap
pointed to represent the association be
fore Congress; also the holding of a con
ference with army and navy surgeons to
((insider pending legislation.
The executive committee recommended
for adoption resolutions to create a de
partment of public health, with a Cabinet
officer at its head; to reorganize the army
and navy medical corps; to raise the sur
g< on general to the rank of major general,
and providing for the employment of
women in military hospitals.
FAVORS THE PRESERVATION
OF KILLARNEY LAKES
NEW YORK, June 7.â A cable to the
Journal from London says: The Journal
correspondent to-day interviewed promi
nent Irish members of Parliament anent
the scheme to buy the Lakes of Killarney.
John Dillon said: "I like the idea, which
is characteristic of the Americans a.nd
honorable to its men of wealth and their
; interest in the land of their parentage."
Colonel Baundei son said: "I wonder
: they don't propose to buy the entire isl
â  and."
Swift McNeil said: "I regret that our
public spirit at home is not equal to the
| emergency."
Patrick O'Brien, the Parnellite whip,
i said: "I should like to see Ireland bought
i out of John Bull's hands altogether, we
I should get justice irom Brother Jona-
I than."
Michael Davitt- The movement to buy
\ Killarney Lakes is very satisfactory to
' me as indicating the living interest In all
that concerns Ireland among American
> citizens of Irish extraction. I would
S rather, however, that 20.000,000. of our race
! in the United States would negotiate with
: England for the purchase of the whole of
! Ireland, so as to liberate it from English
! rule, but I fear such a project is too big
j an undertaking just now even for your
: country. The gigantic scheme to pur
| chase Killarney Lakes by Irish-Ameri
! cans will, of course, be more popular in
'. Ireland than if some English speculator
grabbed the property. If we had an Irish
Parliament proper action would be taken
!at once. we would buy the lakes and
j turn the beautiful place into a national
! park, as the United States did with the
i Yellowstone region.

AUGUSTIN DALY
DIES IN PARIS
PARIS. June 7. â Augustln Daly died suddenly this afternoon.
The late Augustln Daly was born in Plymouth, North Carolina, July 20, 1838.
His education was received partly in Norfolk, Virginia, and In the public
schools in New York City. He begun his literary carer as dramatic editor of the
Sunday Courier of New York in IS5;>, and he continued to discharge, similar func
tions on that paper, on the New York Times, the Sun, the Mail and Express and
the Citizen until 1869, when he opi-nrd ihe Fifth Avenue Theater, on Twenty
fourth street. This building was destroyed by fire in IST.'i. and three weeks later
he opened another theater, formerly the Globe, on Broadway, under the former
name. Early in August, 1879, he established Daly's Theater, on Broadway, near
Thirtieth street, and several years ago he opened in l^ondon, England, a thor
oughly equipped house under the same name. For several seasons he managed
the Grand Opera-house Jn New York.
His career as a dramatic author began in 1882 with an adaptation from the
German of Mosenthal's "Devorah," and since then he has produced many plays,
among them "Divorce." "Pique," "Horizon." "Under the Gaslight," and numer
ous adaptations from the French and German dramatists. He achieved also a
notable distinction in the presentation of Shakesperean drama, although his
productions In this field were the occasion of much conflicting criticism.
In recent years the combination of players with which his name has been
identifiedâ Daly's company of comediansâ has achieved an international reputa
tion under the leadership of Miss AdaHehan, whose remarkable talents have
constituted a leading factor In the success of hifl undertakings. Mr. Daly de
voted ail his time to his theatrical enterprises. He was an enthusiastic and
hard worker, always noted for the elevation of his dramatic purposes and the
completeness of his scenic, presentations.
NOTHING COMES
OF CONFERENCE
Boers and Britons Did
9
Not Agree.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, June B.â The Exchange Tele
graph Company to-day publishes an inter
view with the Parliamentary Secretary of
the Colonial Oiuee. the Earl of Selborne,
in which hi' declares that the conference
;it Bloemfontein, orange Free State, be
tween President Kruger of the Transvaal
Republic and the British High Commis
sioner and Governor of Cape Colony, Sir
Alfred Mllner, proved eminently unsatis
fa< tory, and that there is no prospect of
iti r< sumption.
The Right Hon. Arthur J. Balfour, First
Lord of the Treasury and Government
li -aili r in ihi House of Commons, in the
course of a speech at a political banquet
this evening, said that the failure of the
Bloemfontein conference was a source of
deep regret to the Government. It was
England's duty, he .said, not to allow her
rights to be trampled upon; but he did
not believe' that the controversies were in
capable of solution.
In concluding his references to the con
ference Mr. Balfour said:
"My sanguine forecast of a successful
issue "lit Mi these troubles is basud on the
facts that the principles so obvious as the
â  i mentary rights of civilization*, which
we demand lor bur fellow-countrymen,
rr.ust commend themselves to- the citizens
of the Transvaal; and I venture to think
that the good sense, justice, policy and
wisdom of the leaders of public opinion in
the Transvaal will cause some settlement
which will rightly preserve the independ
ence of the Transvaal."
ibe report of the breakdown of the*
Bloemfontein negotiations has created
considerable excitement in political and
official circles ami tiiere is much specula
tion as to the next move of the British
Government. While Gnat Britain prob
ably does not mean war, it is generally
thought that at any rate there will be
military preparations.
BRUSSELS, June 7.â Dr. Leyds, the
European representative of the Trans
vaal, has received an oiHcial dispatch
from Pretoria confirming the report of
the failure of President Kruger and the
British High Commissioner, Sir Alfred
Milner, to reach an agreement at the con
fi rence Just held at Bloemfontein. It is
d that although President Kruger tt
fered important concessions he made them
contingent upon the British acceptance
of the principle of arbitration on the dif
ferences existing between Great Britain
md the Transvaal. Great Britain here
tofore has invariably refused on the
ground that it would be an acknowledg
ment of the '-quality of the two countries.
According to the dispatch received oy
I>r. Leyds, President Kruger proposed
that a sojourn of two years be necessary
for naturalization and that the full fran
chise be acquirableflve years later, coupled
with property and other qualifications.
The British High fommissioner regarded
the proposal as insufficient and made a
counter-proposal. President Kruger, it is
further asserted, intends to submit both
proposals to the VolksVaad, subject to the
favorable derision of Great Britain rela
tive to arbitration.

BRUTALITY OF
A JAP SKIPPER
Robs and Maroons Poor
Yap Natives.
Special PlrrntrH *" The r-a.ll.
VICTORIA, B. C, June The steamer
Tacoma, which reached here this after
noon, brought the news of some exceed
ingly sharp and brutal practice of a Jap
anese skipper which when the steamer
left was being made the subject of offi
cial investigation. The alleged offender is
' Captain Oda of the Japanse brig Matsu
saka Marti, which is owned by a Mr. Yo
' koo of Tokio, and the unfortunate victims
were twenty-seven natives of Yap, one of
the Caroline group of islands, about 400
miles from the new American colony of
Guam. The Japan Herald, which 'tells the
story, says:
It seems that these natives, men and wo
men, the former before the war employed
by Mr. Friedlander, the manager, for Captain
M. O'Keefe, the copra king, took passage on
' the 10th of October last in the Matsusaka Maru
! for Guam, and paid their fares in advance.
Captain Oda was In no hurry to fulfill his
contract in carrying his passengers to Guam,
j and he proceeded leisurely to the Pellew
1 Islands, where he landed the poor natives on
October 22. For two months he lay there.
; and then he rounded up the men and women
from Yap. telling them that he would now
go direct to Guam. Instead of doing this,
, however, he carried, them to the Bonin Islands,
i where he dumped them without food or re
| sources on a sparsely inhabited island on Feb
i ruary 10. After marooning the natives and
leaving them on the island, friendless and
without resources, the hard-hearted Japanese
sailed away leaving them to their fate. An
intervention of Providence saved the entire
! party from being starved to death. About two
weeks after they had been marooned, a trad
ing schooner from one of the other islands
was driven close on shore by a storm, and
those on her noticed the signals of the na
tives and landed. They found twenty-one
emaciated and half-starved natives, scarcely
strong enough to stand. ' Six had died. Food
was given to the unfortunates and they were
i taken to one of the more populated islands in
I the group by the schooner. There a kind-
I hearted English woman, Mrs. Robinson, wife
j of a trader, took pity on them and paid the
I fare of five of the women, two men and two
boys to Yokohama by the N. Y. K. steamer
Suminoye Maru, on which they reached the
Japanese port on May 15. Eleven men and onÂ«
woman remain on the islands, as they were
unable to secure a passage.
From the stories told by the natives it
seems that Captain Oda not only marooned the
natives, thinking that they would starve to
death and thus hide his crime, but he robbed
them also. They had 350 yen when they em
barked on the Matsusaka Maru, but this the
Japanese squeezed out of them in return for
food, after the wretched persons had exhausted
their own supply. The Japanese charged them !
II a pound for bad rice, at which rate it Is not !
remarkable that their funds soon fell to zero
They were originally allowed to live in the '
cabin, but as soon as their funds fell they were
unceremoniously removed to the hold where
they were compelled to take their rest on the !
top of a mass of stinking cargo until they were
thrown ashore on the Bonins and left to starve
to death. Captain Oda will be arrested as soon
as he returns to Japan.

ST. LOUIS, June 7.â two of the pu

as to the outcome of the coming Fitz
simmons-Joffries battle. Some of their
opinions- follow:
Bob Douglas, champion welter-weight

Professor. Mooneyâ Jeffries is a fine, big
fellow, but he impresses me as being too
slow [or Fitzsimmons. Ryan may teach
him a trick or two that may help him.
but to beat the Cornishman he will have
to light faster and better than in any of
his other tights.
Tom Allenâ Fitzsimmons has knocked
out all kinds of men. and who. I pray
you. has this blooming Jeffries knocked
out? Still, stranger things have hap
pened, lie may win; so may I go to
eaven.
Jim Scanlanâ Fitz will win, but Jeffries
ought to give him the best tight in all his
career.
Clarence Ritchie, brother of the fa
mous Johnâ l like Fitzsimmons. but Jef
fries is young and strong, and if he will
only keep cool he may land the money. .
All Spinks snysi it will be a great tight,
and, while Fitzsimmons looks to be a
sure winner, Jeffries may furnish a sur
prise party.
Veteran Tim Kellyâ l like Jeffries. If
the youngster will keep his head, he will
win, "but if he loses It he is. a goner, for
Fitzsimmons is the quickest in the world
to take advantage of an opening.

NEW STORK, Juno 7.â The stylo or
character of lij?htinK which is to be con-
Bldered fair or foul was. discussed ar.
Fitzsimmons' training quarters at Bath
Beach to-day by George Siler, who .\iil
referee the tight, ajid Fitzsimmons. The
champion informed the referee that he
was agreeable to almost any style thai
suited Jeffries. Fitzsimmons said as th^
articles of agreement permitted no hit
ting "ii breakaways or ill clinches lie was
\--. w.ell satisfied with them and expect
ed Siler to -see that Jeffries as well aa
himself observe the conditions thorough

knockdown or breakaway the man scor
ing the blow should be compelled to step
back three paces, or ten feet, In order ; i
;t\-Â«i--i] the possibility <>f a foul. lie sail
that otherwise he had no suggestions to
offer.
Later Slier had a conference with \\ il
llam A. Brady. .)> BCries' manager, about

that Jeffries simply asked for an ev< ti
break and wanted the referee to enforce
the rules as laid down In the articles ol
agreement to the letter. He said thai the
1 est of feeline existed between Julian.
Fitzsimmons, Jeffries and himself, and
he did not want any unpleasantness in
connection with the subject under discus

Hi objected, however, to Fttzsimmons'
suggestion about stepping bacTc. He said
that either principal should have the right
to follow the other after delivering i
blow, and if the mail struck tried to clinch
the one delivering the blow he should
have the rie;ht to push him back and !.>l
low up the advantage if possible. Mv
pointed out that a man receiving a very
hard blow might clinch to avoid a knock
out and cause the other man to throw
away the chance unless he understood he
was at liberty to hit" him.
Siler said v .c would consider the matter
and announce his decision in a short time.
He felt sine that Fitzsimmons, w \\<t
seemed perfectly willing to make conces

said he would follow the tinier, who would

Siler assured Brady that Jeffries would

he would show no favors to either man.
Brady informed the referee that If he had
not felt sure that Siler would do so he
would not have accepted him for the posi

CORBETT REVEALS
PRIZERING SECRETS
Always Had th>e Purses for hjis
Fights Divided in
Advance.
NEW YORK. June 7.â James J. Corbett, former champion pugilist.
made some remarks this afternoon that revealed some of the In
ner workings of the prize ring. Incidentally he had something
to say about his own career in the ring. He admitted th,at on the
night of his fight with Tom Sharkey he had his share of the
money snfely stored away in a safe in his house in Harlem before the
bell for the opening round rang, and he said that he came away from
Carson City with more money than Fltzsimmona carried. Speaking of
the Fitzsimmons-J. i'fries light, he said:
"The purse between Fitzsimmons and Jeffries will be divided. 1 don't
know how much money each will get, but Jeffries will get his share. The
exact division of the purse can never be stipulated in the articles of
agreement. Allowances must always be made for certain money to be
paid to certain persons â you understand?
"Now. take my fight with Sharkey. The truth about that has never
been told. After the very unsatisfactory ending of the .encounter the
gre^t majority of persons believed that it was a fake, and they cited as
proof of their opinions that the purse was divided. It would surprise
many persons, however, to know that the nurse was divided before the
fight began.
"On the afternoon of the fight I bought a safe for $40 ;md had it taken
up to my house in Harlem. Before the light began I got $16,000, and it
went into that safe. 1 don't know what Sharkey got. It is none of
my business. I had my money, and then the only thing I had to look
after was my reputation.
"It may be a very pleasing delusion to believe that two fighters are
going to the trouble of training for many weeks and draw large crowds
and big gate receipts, only to let the winner and manager of the enter
prise get all the money. Without the loser the fight could not go on.
His reputation, especially before he loses, is the drawing card; so why
should not he get a division of the purse beforehand? They all do it.
"When I lost to Fitzsimmons at ("arson City I came away with more
money than Fltzsimmons made. Of course, had I won the battle I would
have won much more money, but I got the large end of the purse.
"In every bout which I have fought I have had it arranged so that I
would have been well fixed, no matter which way the decision went.
But. of course, I would make more if I won, and then the incentive to
preserve my reputation would make me light my best.
"It looks as though I might never get a whack at Fitzsimmons again.
After having avoided me for two years on the ground that he had re
tired he decided to fight Sharkey. Julian, his manager, said to O'Rourke.
Sharkey's manager, in the Hotel Bartholdi conference:
" 'What's the use of talking? I sec by the papers that you don't want
to fight for nine months.'
"'I see by the papers.' replied O'RourÃe, that Fitzsimmons is never
going to tight again."
â  "We did say something like that.' said Julian, 'but there's too many
good things going around now.'
"That explains why Fitzsimmons comes back into the ring. He won't
fight me, but he thinks there are some good things to be picked up. We
are In hopes, in the interest of American pugilism, that Jeffries will prove
a disappointment for him.
"I want to see Jeffries whip Fitzsimmons," Corbett continued, "be
cause I think it will be a good thing for pugilism. Jeffries is only 25
years old. He is a fighter. If he wins he will lie willing to defend the
championship. He will not keep out of harm's way for several years by
saying that he has retired. But if Fitzsimmons wins there will be no
more championship battles. He will retire -into his shell again for several
years, and when he comes out he will be too old to fight."
CHAMPION
HAS LOST
NO SPEED
<:-<;*! DlsDatcb to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 7.â Oppressive h^at
at Bath Beach to-day caused Fitzsim
mons to cut down his programme consid
erably. In tin- morning the only work he
performed was to fight the hag ten two
minute rounds. Heretofore Fitzsimmons
has fought three-minute rounds. He
banged the Leathern sphere viciously, and
qppercuts, swings ana jabs flew thick and
fasi during the twenty minutes he was
at it. While Fitzsiniinons was exercising
with the punching bag Mrs. Fitzsimmons,
a, woman frlend^f hers and about twenty
snorting men viewed the exhibition and
heartily appjauded his efforts. Fitzsim
mons has certainly iost none of his
speed or hitting pow< r.
After the exhibition he received a rub
dewn and took things very easy until 4
o'clock in the afternoon, when he again
entered the gymnasium for exercise. He
hit the bag ten two-minute rounds, smash
ing it hard all the whiie and missing it on
only two occasions.
At tin- conclusion of the bag-punching
work lit sparred thret rounds each with
Yank Kenny. Dan Hickey and Jack
Everhardt. Fitzsimmons made his spar
ni;g partners tight fast all the while. His
bcut with Everhardt was particularly in
t. resting for the reason that the light
weight pugilist feinted considerably and
made desperate efforts to score heavily on
the champion. Jack seemed particularly
arxious to get an spotting for the hcad^
but Fitzsimmons was wary and kept the
New Orleans boy more than busy evading
hard blows aimed at the body ami head.
When the boxing bouts were over Boh
received a hard rub-down and rested until
sundown, when he enjoyed a road run to
Prospect Park and return. Fitzsimmons
was accompanied on the trip by his wife,
who rode Ln a carriage, and seemed im
mensely pleased by the way ln which the
champion sprinted" along.
When shown Corbett's statement to the
effect that the purse in the light was to
b< divided. Fitzsimmons said:
"Corbett can whack up purses if he
wants to do so. 1 nave my ideas about
purse money; so has he. They can talk
all they want to now, but after I defeat
Jeffriesâ and I'll do the trick in two
roundsâ Til never fight again. I was
never in better shape in my life than 1 am
at present, and I'll give those fellows who
think I have gone back a big surprise."

Br*>cia! Dispatch to Thi
ASBI'RY PARK, June 7.â As the time
for the fight draws near the number of
visitors to Jeffries' camp Increases. Billy
Delaney, who has the big fcfoiler-maker
in charge, is kept busy answering tele
graphic inquiries as to the Californian's
condition.
Jeffries did light work to-day on ac
count of the heat. This morning he
punched the bag a half-hour and then |
left for the beach, a quarter of a mile I
away, to cool off. This afternoon Jeffries
and his trainers posed in front of the
kinetoscope machine. Two sets of pic
tures were taken at the training quar
ters, after which the party adjourned to
the beach. Jeffries was disposed to do
some light exercise, but his trainers ad
vised him to lay off for the rest of the !
day and the Calif ornian consented. To
night he gave a public boxing exhibition
at the opera-house in connection with a ,
comedy show. He was at home and in
bed by 10 o'clock.
After his exercise to-day he said he
never felt better in his life. Contrary to
general expectation the continued warm
weather has affected Jeffries but little.
He is not worrying about any interfer
ence by Chief Devery of the police. De
laney said to-night:
"We have our hands full at the train
ing quarters getting ready for the fight,
and there is no use. worrying over mat
ters that will be adjusted satisfactorily.
Jeffries does not have any apprehensions
as to the result of the tight. He says he
knows what he can do and is satisfied
from what he has seen and heard of Kilz
simmons that the latter cannot knock him
out."
Delaney believes that when the two
men enter the ring the liettins will be
about 10 to 8 on Fitzsimmons. Marty Mc-
Cue, who trained here with Jeffries anil
Kyan for his fight a few days age is
putting out some loose coin on Jeffries at
odds of 40 to 25. It was decided this af
ternoon to break ramp on Friday morn-
Ing and go direct to Coney Island.
Aguirre Takes the Oath.

Aguirre, Warden of San Quentin. was in
Sacramento for a short time to-day. He
visited the Capitol, where he took the
oath of office and filed hi* bond. The bon-J

AN OCEAN STORM
STILLED BY METEOR
Thrilling Experience of Those on
the Paramatta During F^ough
Weather.
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 7.â The commander of the P. and O.
steamer Paramatta reports a Btrange experience at sea on the way
Singapore to Hongkong. After passing the Parcels, a severe thun
storm was experienced, accompanied by rain and heavy seas, but
storm was abruptly stopped and the elements amuck stilled in a
startling and awe-inspiring manner. At 10:55 a. m. 'Iv storm had
reached ty, when suddenly, straight from the warring
elements above, like a Bhrapnell from a man-of-war, an Immense mass
etal descended, whirring into the Bea nol 300 yards from the ship.
As the meteor struck the water it exploded with a mighty noise, while
a vivid flash of lightning, which seemed to set the air trembling and
caused a blinding blue llghi to hang over the ship for thirty seconds.
The lightning was followed by a deafening t h^l f| f thunder, then all was
still. The air became as crystal. The wild wind ceased to shriek
through th( rigging. The rain clouds had disappeared and the very
wavi i to temporarily suspend their ceaseless roll as if all na
ture had been stunned by a mighty shock. The Paramatta was un
harmed, though shaken from stem to stern as if in a mighty grasp. In
fifteen minutes the storm commenced again and lasted far Into the night.
HORSWHIPPED
BY AN ACTRESS
Marcus Mayer Attacked
by Miss Or me.
Special Pi<=ratch to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 7.â Marcus R.

Paul :!' h>- â¢;â¢ mail
gainst her Â â¢ i de
do this. She was released.
The young woman, who has figured
in public happenings before, reached
the American line pier early in the
morning and at once went aboard the
St. Paul. She was seen walking the
decks and stationed herself at the
gangway. Mr. Mayer, accompanied by
Miss Nethers.ile and Joseph Herbert,
reached the ship twenty minutes before:
sailing time and stood just beyond the
gangplank talking to George W. Led
f-rer, manager of the Casino, and Mr.
Herbert. Miss Orme, who stood behind
the group, drew her whip, and, reach
ing over Mr. Lt-derer's shoulder, struck
Mayer twice in the face with it. As
he fell back his silk hat was- knocked
off and rolled d'uvn the gangplank.
Miss < Â»rme fled down the deck to the
gangplank used by the second cabin
passengers and thence to the pier,
where she was seized by Mi Lederer.
She made some protest, but he insisted
that she accompany him and led her
down the dock to a policeman and
called upon him to arrest the woman.
The policeman said that If Mr. Mayer
would go to the station house ami
make a complaint against the woman
tie would arrest her. but otherwise he
could not do so. When Mr. Mayer de
clined to do this, Mr. Lederer offered to
make the complaint, but the policeman
would not accept it and Miss Orme
was permitted to go.
Mr. May.-t. Ms he bathed the marks
!'-ft by 'he whip "n his face, said he
did ii"t know his assailant, and was a'
a loss to account for her art.
"She was arrested In London some
years ago." h*' said. " ; i r. ' i in an inter

"Mr. Mayer has >lnne everything p<>s

Miss Orme this evening. "In London

NOTE'S VALIDITY
TO BE ATTACKED
Legal Strife for a Yolo
County Estate.
Special Dispatch to The Call
â¢ WOODLAND, June There is a strong
probability that a sensational trial, in
volving the validity of a note, will take
place in Yolo County at an early date.
The facts in the case, so far as they have
been developed, are about as follows: In
the latter part of last November George
Washington Johns, an old settler, died in
this city, leaving a large estate in Yolo
and Colusa counties. His will was pro
bated in this county and Elizabeth J.
Gregory and George W. Gregory were
appointed executors. The estate was be
queathed, share and share alike, to four
children of deceased- James W. Johns,
Elizabeth J. Gregory, Matilda A. Allen
and Polly Ann Nancy Frlelâ with the pro
vision that they shall not convey to other
parties or incumber their share of the
property with any indebtedness. In case
of the death of any of said children their
interest in said estate shall go to thoir
children, If they have no children, then
their share shall be divided equally be
tween the remaining children of deceased.
When the will was ma many
Intances of the family were sur
â  that the deceased had not provided
is grandchildren George w. Gregory

SUES FOR SCHOOL FUNDS.
Stockton's Action Against County
Superintendent Wi'ight.
STOCKTON. June 7.â Judge Budd to
day issued a writ of mandate requiring
County Supt-rlntendf-nt of Schools Wright
to show cause why he should not pay over
to the city %'i'MX) or thereabouts, alleged to
be due on a proper apportionment of the
schDol funds. The trouble is not of Mr.
Wright's making, but originated during
George Goodell's administration of the
office, he having decided that those pupils
attending night and high .schools were not
entitled to enumeration In the census upon
which the apportionment of State school
funds was made; in other words, the Sin to
fund was intended for primary and gram
mar schools and must be apportioned to
these schools upon a basis of the number
of children of school age in the several
districts.
Superintendent Wright makes answ-r
that inasmuch as the apportionment was
made by Mr. Goodell he should not be
required to pay 6ver the money, as future
decisions might show that he was not
in sc doing, and he would thereby
become personally responsible for tho
amount. The city of Stockton was pla'n
i tiff In the action.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE S, 1899.
SOPRANO OF FINE
STRIPE DIVULGED
BY SIG, LAMBARDI
Also a Valuable Tenor
in "Lucia."
A CREDITABLE PRODUCTION
By Ashton Stevens.
More surprises were sprung by the
Lambardi Opera Company last night
in the good old opera of â¢'Lucia." First
to be mentioned is the young woman
programmed by the tantalizing name of
Senorita Italia V. flepetto. She sang
the title part and her work was wonder
ful. .Let this unknown senorita appear
once as the understudy of Melba in this
same part and her reputation is made
the world over. She has the birdie
voice â thin, true, lithe and clear as
glassâ in its superlative. In the "mad"
song she shamed an excellent flute, and
the audience fairly wallowed in ap
plause. Miss Repetto is not beautiful to
see, and she lacks Jamentably in those
qualities of personal spell and magne
tism that play so great a part in the
fate of an operatic artist, but she can
sing Lucia as perhaps we have seld>m
heard it sung before, except from Fatti
and Melba, and her next appearance
will be looked forward to with warm
Interest by all who heard her last
night.
The other discovery was a tenor
named Russo. He sang Edgardir as we
have not heard it sung in years. His
voice, like that of the Senorita Italia
V. Repetto's, is not much in bulk; it is
lyric to a degree, but clear, sure (bar a
few strained top notes), and capable at
times of urgent dramatic expression.
The orchestra was more at peace in
the simple Donizetti music, and the
chorus, too, was happier than on the
opening night. Altogether the perform
ance was extremely creditable. Al
thuugh but five singers came to the
front in the sextet, that famous old
number was given out with stirring
effect. The ancient but seldom heard
opera of "Nonna" is the bill for to
night.
To-night and the Saturday matinee
mark the last performances here of
Mrs. Riggs' new comedy, which is still
without a title. n n Friday and Satur
day nights the Kelcey-Shannon <"<>m
pany will fall back on -The Moth and
th- Flame," a play that, while absurd
in its melodramatic features, is sur
passing in its comedy and satire. The
Henry Miller engagement, which will
probably be the most important of the
year, commences Monday in the Colum
bia with Henry Arthur Jones' Dew
comedy, "The Liars."
* â¢
Lewis Morrison, Florence Roberts I
and the Alcazar Company are stiil I
playing "Hamlet" at the little theater
on O'Farrell street. The attraction for
next week is "The Master of Cere
monies," which scored signal success
last year.
The droll double bill of Gilbert & Sul
livan's "Pirates" and Leoncavallo's
â¢Pagliacci" is attracting favorable at
tention at the Grand. The Southwells
are giving the best popular priced en
tertainment in town and drsrve suc
cess.
â¢ * â¢
I'ntil further notice "The Merry
\\"..r" is tli.- bill at the Tivoli. Gracie
Plaisted may not be much of a singer, I
but she has a host of friends who seem j
to make it their business to turn out
every night with glad hands and flow
ers.
Â» * â¢
The Orpheum has a big bill this
week. Several of the turns have already
come r<< criticism in this paper, but on
the whole the show is up to the aver
age, and certainly succeeds in drawing
the usual crowd.
â¢ Â» â¢
At the Chutes to-night the la?t of the
amateur minstrel shows will be given.
Now that William Shakespeare's
"Hamlet" has come into such vogue, I
wonder the management does not ex
hibit the novices in that. What's the
matter with an amateur "Hamlet"
night ?

HARD-HITTING
BOXERS SHOW
GREAT SPORT
Good Bouts at San
Francisco Club.
FURIOUS FIGHTING IN ORDER
MYERS STOFS THE GALLOP OF
ED SMITH OF THE IOWA.
Bert Woods Defeats William Gran
field, While William Condon
Gets the Decision Over
Dan Barry.
If Fitzsimmons and Jeffries show as
good sport in their battle for the world's
championship as was shown in each of
the live bouts at the San Francisco Ath
letic Club last night the spectators will
have hail a run for their money. There
were boxers of all weights and sizes, each
seemingly with but one object in view,
and that waa to annihilate the man in
front of him. The boxing throughout
was of the whirlwind order, and the
spectators veiled thvmHelves hoarse at
the earnestness of the men.
The principal bout was scheduled to go
ten ruunds. The contestants were L.
Myers and Ed Smith, the latter of the
[owa, and the former an ex-man-of-wars
nian. Smith fought himself to an abso
lute standstill in four rounds during
which he was on the aggressive. He
made play for the body, and landed re
peatedly, drawing a sickly smile from
Myers' face. The pace was fast from
the first tap of the gong. In the fourth
round the men followed one another all
over the ring giving Mow for blow.
Smith finally received a stiff righthander
that put him out of the game.
Deacon Jones, the diminutive colored
boxer, and James Crawford were put in
to supply the comedy element. They
omitted all fancy blows and sailed into
one another as though they wece lighting
for a kingdom. The "Deacon." who was
much smaller than his opponent, forced
the lighting, to the evident delight of the
spectators, whose shouts must have been
beard Mocks away. Referee (Jreggains
called it a draw.
The "Deacon" remained in the ring to
make a speech and thereby secured the
long end of the purse. He made a short
speech, commencing: "Ladies and qe:!tle
men: Next time I will let the booze alone
and will guarantee to make a better shew
ing." He did not get much beyond this
when silver of various denominations
commenced to drop in the ring as though
shak< -i from some cloud with a silver lin
ing. That ended the dusky gladiatoi s
speech, as he then applied nims^if assld
u< ÃBly to reaping the harvest
The bout between Ed Prendergast
and Charles Vickers showed a fclne
toscope picture of revolving arms and
bodies that went spinning about like
animated tops. No effort was made at
guarding, each man being n :h- ring iip
parently with but one obieâ . and that
was to 'knock the other's block off. Ref
eree Greggains' decision was a popular
one
William Condon was given the decision
over Dan Harry after :-ix rounds of
i pirited work, during which bio >d flowed
in n < rim son stream.
One of the best bouts was between Kert
Woods a pupil of Walter "VVatson. and
William Granfield. It was give and tf.ke
thioughout. Woods playing for the body.
while* Granfield tried for the m.r.e vul
nerable point of the jaw. Moth were
clever and clean hitters, doing great ex
ecution. There was no let-up, th? men
keeping at It all the. time. ThÂ« enl came
suddenly in the fourth round, when
\V( ods landed a right hander on the .law
that diopped Granfleld. The latter ro.led
over on his back, but was too dazed to
crei 01. his feet until the fateful ten sec-
Is had been counted.
The pymnnsium was thron-^d tc the
doors. Billy Jordan was master of cere
monies and' Alex Greggains referee. He
is a perfect "Czar" Heed in '.he rinjt, keep
ing the men up to their work and over
looking i etty fouls.

FLAG PRESENTATION.
Oriental Rebekah Lodge Places a
Standard in the Keeping of
Canton No. 5.
On the 11th of last May. during the
session of the Grand Lodge of Odd Fel
lows. Oriental Rebekah Lodge No. 90
served a lunch to the delegates and an
nounced that "the proceeds would be
used for some purpose, but that was a
mystery." That mystery was solved last
night in memorial hall of the Odd Fel- j
lows' building in the presence of a very :
largC number of ladies and gentlemen.
At 10 o'clock Canton San Francisco No.
5. Patriarchs Militant, entered th< hall.
and when the members in their gay uni
form came to attention a curtain at the ;
head of the hall was drawn and there .
was a tableau representing Columbia, i
Miss Abbie E. Ewing holding in her hand
a beautiful silk American flap, while by
her side stood Captain Rrookell. repre
senting the United States army. Marvin
Kellogg the navy, Miss Klizabeth Stella
Shaw as Rebekah and Richard Scott rep
resenting Lincoln's "Greatest Thoughtâ |
the Colored Race." Miss Ewing then in
a few well chosen remarks said that Ori
ental Rebekah Lodge recognized what
the Canton had done for the order, and
Oriental Lodge had decided to get up a |
mysterious lunch to raise funds to pur
chase a nag for the Canton, and she then :
placed it in the keeping of the patri
archs. .
Captain Flint, the commander, received ,
it and in a short speech returned thanks. I
Three cheers were given for Oriental and
then followed short addresses by promi
nent members of the order and dancing
until midniglit.
FRED HERMAN KLEINE
ASPHYXIATED BY GAS
PAID WITH HIS LIFE FOR A
THOUGH x LESS MOMENT.
He Turned Off the Gas and Inad
vertently Turned It on Again
Before Going to Sleep.
Gas asphyxiation claimed another vic
tim last Tuesday night in the person of
Frederick Herman Kleine, a retired car
penter residing with his family at 32 La
pidge street, between Eighteenth and
Nineteenth.
His wife slept in an adjoining room, and I
when she called him for breakfast yes- j
terday morning she found his door un- j
locked, and on opening it was almost
overcome by the suffocating fumes. Her
husband was cold in death. He was lying
in bed in a natural position and the stop
cock of the gas fixtures was, partly turned
en.
The fixtures were in good order and it
is difficult to understand how Mr. Kleine
could have turned off the gas and turned
it on again without being more than us
ually careless.
But there were absolutely no indica
tions of suicide. The clothing of the dead
man was math' folded and placed on a
chair by the side of the bed. He retired
on the previous evening in the best of
spirits, and It is not believed by his
friends that he had even for a moment
harbored a thought of suicide.
Kleine was a native of Germany. 51 years
old. He owned the house occupied by
himself and family and was in comforta
ble circumstances, having retired from
active business some years ago. His chil
dren are a boy and a girl. 1"> and 12 years
old respectively. The deceased was a
member of Germania Lodge, Knights of
Honor. An inquest will be held.

Colonel A. D. Cutler in a Touching
Speech Pays Tender Tribute to
Departed Days and Comrades.
Thp eleventh annual banquet of the
Veteran National Guard of California at
the Occidental last evening was in every
way a success. Not one of the "Old
Guard" wan mis.sine from the board, and
there was everything- there in the way of
viands, wines and mu.sio they could de
sire. Adjutant General Seamans, newly
appointed by Governor Gage, was the
only guest present not a member of the
association.
ma ruler George R. Sanderson a.ct-i]
las toastmaster and was particularly
lhappy in the selection of his topics. Col
loi-pI G. \V. Grannls answered the first,
P'Thc Veteran National Guard of Cali
fornia." Walter Kelley of Company H of
the First Infantry rose to the "Volun
teers of 1898 from the National Guard of
California." General Dickinson spoke of
"The New National Guard of California"
and Colonel H. P. Bush spoke gallantly
for the "Ladies," of whom none were
j.rt sint.
Ttie last of the list. "Departed Days and
I'lmrades." was touchinply responded to
Iby Colonel A. D. Culler. Among- those

ROSE M. STACK DEFEATED.
Judge Seawell Decides That She Can
not Regain Her Position.
Judgment for the Board <>f Education
and against Rose M. Stark, a teacher in
the Buena Vistii Primary School, was or
dered filtered by Judge Seawell yesterday
afternoon. Miss Stack was appointed as
a teacher in the school mentioned in De
cember last, but in the general shake-tip
occurring: last February was remov- d
and placed on the unassigned list. She
brought suit to recover her position, but
the board answered the suit and set forth
that the class presided over by the plain
tiff had been abolished in the Interest of
â¢ conomy. The court held that the action
of the board was within the law, and
hence entered judgment for the defendant.

STREET RAILWAY BONDS AND STOCK
OX Monday last, in its editorial columns, The
Call, so far as possible from available infor
mation, published a full statement of the con
- dition in' the outstanding bonds of the Market Street
.â¢.;>>â¢ Company and of six other railway corpora
tions that were absorbed by that consolidation Oc
tober 13, 1893. From that statement it appeared that,
thorized issue to the amount of $17,500,
--000, the Market Street Railway Company had ac
sued bonds representing $4,817,000. all of
which had been used for additional acquisitions and;
for new construction, and that the bonds of the six
defunct companies taken by themselves remained ex
â  . (Mi their original footing, while the securities on
! which each is=nc depended, subject to the pre-existing
. had been transferred.
The fluctuations in Wall street and in other financial
center-, including San Francisco, where there are 1
frequent and large transactions in bonds and stocks.
â c the necessity of extremely conservative treat
j tnent of their values. But the investing publicis cer
-1 tainly entitled to accurate knowledge of the facts upon
; which these transactions depend, so that innocent per
sons may be saved from risks that, if fully informed,
they would be unwilling to assume.
The Market Street Railway Company is a consoli
'i of eleven corporations that existed before it
was formed. The financial standing of the principal
ers of its stock is beyond dispute. They are ,
v able to respond to their personal liability under j
* Stitution and laws of this State or to any 1
: equitable responsibility that may ultimately fall upon
But the consolidation itself has no other j
property than street railways and franchises mostly de
rived from its eleven predecessors, and six of them
charged with indebtedness, exclusive of interest, to
: the amount of $7.0.^5.000. These franchises will ex
: pire at different periods during the first third or there
abouts of the twentieth century, and, under the new ;
j charter, where genuine competition is assured upon :
terms much more favorable to the municipality than
J under the existing law. and where also the policy of
the acquisition of public utilities is enforced, there is j
I no certainty that they will be renewed at all or that ;
: any renewals that may be secured will leave them in
: the hands of their present holders.
In its trust mortgage of June 12, I^o4. the Market
Street Railway Company agreed, as rapidly as prac- !
I ticable, to restore the outstanding bonds of the com- '
panics it had succeeded with its own bonds. The fact
that the original bonds are now on the market shows
that this has not been done, although more than five
years has elapsed. The situation, therefore, is Tin
questionably dangerous. The value of the securities
originally given for the protection of these bonds
necessarily depreciate- day by 'lay. And, in addition
to this fact, they are in the hand- of the Market
street combination ai ti ltrol and to its
! manipulation. One method, of manipulation now
â  'ace is simply ruinous. The
identical property which stand-, .-(part from the gtiar
. of the Market street consolidation, if its trust
s the diminishing secur
ity â  â  00, has also been put up to proi
new indebtedness, of which $10,465,000

bonds to the extent that they an ssued, the
Market Si ilway Company is distributing
ing the holders of [86,170 shares 1 pita!
'â¢:. in the form of dividends, $446,808 per annum,
which by V 124 would aggregate 0n.170.200. In ad
dition, therefore, to all, the other elements of depre
ciation to which we ha\ 1 the franchises
which communicate actu 1 I value to street rail

that would provide for bond redemption, if turned
(into a sinking fund, i- being steadily diverted to the
nihi: â  ; stock value 1 ;.
The Huntington monopoly has boldly assumed the
position that it is governed by no rule but its own
will. In this instance it appear- to have gone too
: far. If any reiiance can be placed upon facts and
figures,, unless there are concealed or unknown ar- ;
jements by which they are controlled, there is no ,
stantial basis whatever for the outstanding street,
railway bonds now under consideration, and the in
â  deliberate purpose to leave bund
tors uli itely in the lurch and dependent upon
tion than thai supposed to have been ac
: corded by the upon which they have a legal
right to rely. When tin- securities have been dive-ted
ut al! value except the property remnants that survive ,
the exiting franchises, the bulk of the indebtedness
will have behind it only the personal liability of stock
holder- and such equitable relief as the peculiar man
en t of the mom. poly may justify.
When the Market Street Railway Company lately
supposed itself to have anticipated the new charter
; and to have corruptly secured a network of new
; franchises and privileges that would cover the prin
j cipa! unoccupied parts of San Francisco it had cvi- ;
, deiitly discovered .a method of extrication from its
bond dilemma by stealing enough property to enable
it to pursue its present methods of appropriating its
' revenues and at the same time to provide for the out
standing indebtedness, with an enormous additional
A more transparently infamous scheme
was never devised. An analysis of the facts demon;
-; strates the reason for the desperate attempt to con- j
centrate influence and to 'educe property-owners, by
false pretenses, into an apparent indorsement of the
robbery. The corrupted Supervisors understood per- '
[ectly the extent to which they were sacrificing the
municipal interests at the demand of the railroad.
Several of them have already stated in effect that un
<3ci the new charter street railway bonds could not be
floated with success, and. therefore, they argue Mr.
'Huntington. and not San -Francisco, should be pro- 1
tected. The position of an honest Supervisor would- 1
â¢li that he is not called upon to supply the deficiencies
or to rectify the errors or the frauds or to promote |
the illegitimate speculation-, of this unholy consolida
tion, which has become a nuisance to decent citizen
[ ship. *
There i- no reason, not both fraudulent and cor
rupt, why the Market Street Railway Company should
not be governed by the same principles and by the
same rules applied to ordinary .citizens. Let it take
it:- unclean hands off the government of this great
city. Let it pay its debt> out of its own resources i
and not out of the remaining municipal property. Let
! I it fulfill its written pledge by issuing its own bonds
j for the amalgamated indebtedness it has assumed and !
apply a sufficient proportion of its receipts, now di
verted into dividends, to a sinking fund adequate to |
the redemption of its obligations when they mature, i
Admiral Dewey does not propose to be lionized by
the Eritish. He prefers to wait and be eagleized by

TITE SAN FBASTCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 8, 1899.
THE LAKES OF KILLARNEY.
IN the higher mountains of Siskiyou County, in this
State, notwithstanding the different surroundings,
it is possible to find suggestions of the Lakes of
Killarney. Perched on the edge of a rugged ascent,
in the midst of dense foliage, a small lake, called
Lalita, reposes in quiet beauty, which resembles the
upper lake of the Killarney chain. On a rough and
unfrequented trail between Castle Lake and Gumboot
Lick, in the center of a dense forest, with tall trees
bending over its dark and placid waters, is another
| lake of limited area, which to the traveler recalls the
scene so famous in Iri-.h song and story.
The commingled grandeur and loveliness of the
mountain scenery lying around Mount Shasta, with
its towering pinnacles of snow, and extending from
the head of the McCloud to the sources of the Sacra
mento and the Trinity rivers, has been desecrated by
the vandals of transportation and of manufacture. A
broad stretch of almost unequaled attractions, where
the glittering trout leap in a hundred shaded brooks,
where antiered monarchs in deepest solitude prepare
for their winter nuptials, where the bear fatten on
luscious clover and juicy berries and the rich nuts
that fall from the overloaded trees, has been turned
from its natural use into a scarified memorial of mod
ern covetousness.
But this atrocious vandalism will not compare with
the proposed invasion of Killarney by the pot
boilers of cheap amusements, with the sanction of the
Earl of Kenmare, and presumptively to meet his fam
ily necessities. If on the face of the globa there is a
spot exquisite in itself and bathed in the glories of
legendary and authentic history, it is the Lakes of Kil
larney, the very names of which are filled with liquid
music. They lie within the. compass of a few miles,
deeply imbedded in mountains that rise abruptly
from the water's edge. Lough Learne. studded with
wooded islands, bears on its bosom the ruins of an
old fortress of the O'Donoghues, the remains of
Finnan Abbey and the "sweet Innisfallen" of Thomas
Moore. On the '-haded passages to Lough Tore, the
second of the scries, is Muckross Abbey, built by the
Franciscans more than five centuries ago, and still
; retaining the impress of an artistic conception. The I
| upper and most secluded lake is the smallest of the ;
ithree, covering only 430 acres, but it is so closely!
shut in by the adjoining mountains that it flashes like â¢â 
an emerald in midnight darkness.
In the worm Irish heart the image of this treasure
of nature, over which has been spread the subtle

NOT A SECTIONAL SPEAKER.
SOME slight attempt has been made on the At
lantic seaboard to stamp the candidacy of Mr.
Henderson for Speaker a? sectional.
Perhaps no candidate for the place has been less
â  alist than he.
requires that where the strength of
the party lie- there should he the expression of its
choice for Speaker, if those who have the power and
se to exercise it.
When the Democrats carried the House in 1874.
the firsl " â  'I 1 *. 1 war, they owed their victory
to ch-inpcs in the West, and though the South had a
ority of the members, that section would have
been except for the West. In recognition
of this the Speakership went to Michael C. Kerr of
Indiana, the ablest man his party has ever had in the
He died' not long after assuming the office,
and. there being no other in the West of stature re
quired for the place, it went to Randal! of Pennsyl
vania.
The Republicans have had two Western Speakers,
Colfax of Indiana and Keifer of Ohio. Now the
might of the party is so definitely in the West that
those who represent it have chosen to indicate their
wish, not for a section, hut for the party and the j
country.
Mr. Henderson is the beneficiary of that choice,
and that his election will he for The party's good no
rv( r can deny. Already the evidence is abroad
that he i- tr in the East as in the West, and
Genera! Bingharn of Pennsylvania, who was expected
to have been his competitor, goes over to his stan
<r.rd as an ally, carving twenty votes with him.
Henderson represents t<> an exalted degree the stal
wart Western feeling winch is the country's highest
inspiration. He was hardly a voter when he left a
leg on the hattiehcld at Pittsburg Landing, and he
and Colonel Thompson of the New York Highland
ers were the only two who hardly waited for their
stumps to heal and for nature to store up blood in
place of that they spilled to go hack into the army
and lead regiments to the end of the war.
Recent martial events have in no way dimmed the
valorous achievements of such men in the great |
battles, where more men were killed in one day than
have been in the rank- in all our junior war.
All the more that the sting of feeling has been
drawn out of the history of that far time do the peo
ple seem to appreciate the mighty things done then.
Surely the Northern enthusiasm which greets General
Joe Wheeler, the Confederate cavalry leader, and
Mosby, the Navarre and Murat combined of the
Southern army, can rise to so full a tide as to reach
this grizzled veteran of the Union army and give him
as a reward for his military and civil service to hi*
country the leadership of the House.
The experts who predicted a prolonged fight over
th? Speakership of the coming House of Represen
tatives are already hedging their prophecies, for it
now looks as if Henderson would virtually have it
before Congress meets.
Colonel Bryan says it takes as much courage to
fight trusts in this country as it did to storm the
heights around Santiago, which is only a rhetorical
v ;,\ of saying the colonel himself is a bigger man
than Roosevelt.
Some enterprising gentlemen have challenged the
French to an automobile race to be held in this coun
try within the near future, so we are to have another
: international complication <>n our hands before long.
One of the most satisfactory accomplishments of
the time is the promptness and the efficiency with
: which the report of the Beef Inquiry Court has been
canned, embalmed and buried.

his wife. He then came to this city and
Bent his wife $60. A few days later he'
wired her that he was si<-k at the Golden
West Hotel and requested her to send,
him $2^. Th- 1 money was sent by tele
graph, and Mrs. Grigsby also requested
to lie allowed to come down in order that
she might care fur her husband. The!
sergeant wired her that it was not neces
sary, as In' was better, and the same
â  g he used the borrowed money in
order to marry his third wife. Castner i
says that Grigsby has borrowed money
from his aunt-in-law, and he believes
that h>- owes a great deal of borrowed
money to many persons. He also thinks
that he has evidence that will show that

AN INCENDIARY
OPERATING ON
GEARY STREET
Two Suspicious Fires
in a House.
THE SECOND IS SUCCESSFUL
BOTH BUILDING AND CON
TENTS OVER-INSURED. â¢
Fire Marshal Towe Is Making a
Thorough Investigation Into
the Affair, but With Little
Hope of Success.
Fire Marshal Towe is investigating a
suspicious fire that occurred about 2
o'clock yesterday morning at 2406 Geary
street, an old, one-story shack house, oc- |
cupied by Gustav Haft, a partner in a j
saloon at 431 Bush street, and his wife.
They came here from Minnesota about |
two months ago.
The house was totally destroyed by fire ;
early yesterday morning, but there are j
circumstances that lead jo the suspicion j
that an Incendiary was at work. So far I
the Fire Marshal has not been able to ar- j
rive at a satisfactory solution of the mat
ter.
He had both Haft and his wife at his
office yesterday and subjected them to a
rigid examination. Their stories agreed in ,
every essential particular. They said they
left the bouse Sunday afternoon and went
to the Balopn, where they remained till !
about 3 'o'clock Monday morning. They
started for home then, walking all the
â nay, and on arriving they found the inte- ,
riof of the house on fire. They succeeded !
in putting the fire out without much dam
age being done.
Haft did not return to the house after
Monday morning, and his wife remained
there Tuesday In the hope that the insur
ance agent with whom they had insured
their furniture and effects for $500 would
turn up and see what damage had been
done, but he failed to make' his appear
ance. Neither he nor his wife had been
at the house since Tuesday evening, and :
when his wife went to the house yester
day morning she was surprised to find it
totally destroyed.
There is no question in the Fire Mar
shal's mind that the house was burned to
the ground by an incendiary. He finds
that Haft's furniture and effects were in- j
sured for $S"W. but he is satisfied that so
far as the furniture was concerned $.V>
would have covered the amount, but Mrs.
Haft assured him that her jewelry and
personal effects would have more than |
covered the amount of the insurance.
The building, according to the Fire Mar
shal, was not worth more than $300, but It
was insured for $500 and it was mortgaged
to a San Francisco hank. There is a
lawsuit pending In the courts about the
ownership of the building, but who the
real owner is the Fire Marshal has as.
yet been unable to ascertain. He lias been
informed that the owner Is George Me- !
Henry, but he has not been able to find
him. "

IS DETECTED IN TIME.
When Her Three Children Are Taken
From Her She Attempts to
Beat Out Her
Brains.
Mrs. Pfrto Palo de Ciro, who atteÂ
: to kill her husband on Hinkley allej
day night with a hatchet because he^
wanted to take her three children from r
I her, attempted to end her own life and the
lives of the children in the City Pi
; Tuesday night.
Ever since her arrest she has beer.
i afraid that the childrtn -would be takea
â¢ from her and given into' the custody of
â  her husband. She had fled from him from
â¢ Seattle in February last owing, as she al
kged, to his ill-treatment, and came to
I this city with the children. He only re-
I ccntly ascertained her whereabouts and
i came on here, and as soon as sh<
' him she attempted to kill him v.
i hatchet and succeeded in cutting his scaip
, open.
She was arrested for assault to comnr*
: murder and the case was called in J
i Treadwell's court Tuesday and continu- i
till to-day. She and the children w
: confined in the matron's apartments, a.\
about 10 o'clock Tuesday night Matro.,
; W right's attention was attracted by a
strong smell of gas that came from the
i dr.rmitory, where the woman and three
children were. She entered the dormitory
and found one of the gas burners turned
on full. She turned off the gas and ex
plained to Mrs. Clco how to use it, as she
believed that she had turned it on in igno
i ranee. About an hour later Mrs. Wright
had again to enter the dormitory owing
: to the strong smell of gas and discovered
' that the woman had again turned on the
gas.
As it was believed that the woman in
[ tended to commit suicide and take her
children with her. shr- was removed to the
women's coil in another part ot the prison
ai.d the children were left in the dormi
tory. She declared yesterday morning
j that she did not know how to use gas and
had no desire to injure her children, as
1 she loved them too "much, but her story
was not believed, as she declared to Vie- â¢
tof Demartini, the Italian Interpreter,
that if the children were taken from her
I she would kill herself.
Yesterday morning Judge Treadwell on
1 being apprised of the circumstances
awarded the custody of the children to
the husband. As soon as the wife was no
. tified of the fact she became hysterical
and attempted to beat her brains out
against the bars of the cell. She tore h--r
hair nut by the roots and acted a_~ 11
were out of her mind. Sergeant Wolf de
tailed a "trusty" to watch the cell so that
any attempt made by her to commit sui
cide might be frustrated.

weman was very kind to her children, and
she had secured a position in a canning
factory so that she could support tht m.

The steam schooner Hueneme will no
longer be eeen in these waters, as she has
been sold by Gray â â â¢ Mitchell to the Inter
island Steamship Company of Honolulu.
The Hueneme will in future ply between
the island of the Hawaiian group. She is
now being loaded for Honolulu by "Welch
& Co. She is almost a new vessel, and
has been engraved in the coasting trade.
At Honolulu additional cabin accommo
dation will be built on her and she will
take the place of one of the company's
boats that was burned a few months ago.
The old bark La Eseocesa will from
now on be known as the American imrk
Coalinpa. This vessel has ha<l quite an
Interesting' history in connection with the
well-known firm of Balfour, Williams &
Co., of which firm Balfour, ' ruthrie & Co.
uf this city is an offshoot. La Escocesa
was built in IS6S by Gourley Bros, in Dun
dee. She is 202 feet long, 34.2 beam and
21.3 .depth, with a net tonnage of 94*;. She
was commanded by Captain D. Evans.
The firm used the vessel in a variety of
enterprises, sending her here and there
when she hid a charter and when she
had not it loaded her at Its own risk and
pent her to the uttermost parts of the
world. In fact, the little bark, which was
yachtllke in appearance, trim and good to
look upon, was regarded by the firm more
in the light of a. training ship for boys
destined to work in their larger vessels.
The Eseocesa was often on this coast and
not long since he left here after she had

CALIFORNIA AT THE
EXPORT EXPOSITION
DRIED FRUIT MEN DECIDE TO
MAKE A DISPLAY.
They Will Raise a Fund of S2OOO to
Send Their Product to
Philadelphia,
A meeting of gentlemen representing the
dried fruit interests of the State was held
yesterday at the rooms of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association upon
invitation of J. M. Stauffer, commissioner
for the Philadelphia Export Exposition.
He desired to get from them, as he does
from the wine men and the fruit and
salmon canners, an expression of opinion
concerning the California -display at the
exposition, which was designed for the
expansion of American export trade.
The attendance was not large, but the
gentlemen present were well prepared to
; discuss the matter, several of them, nota
bly B. N. Rowley, of the California Fruit
grower, having had much experience In
â  preparing for the big display at the Ham
burg Exposition.
It was decided in short order that Cali
fornia should be represented by a great
collective display, experience having
taught the lesson that individual exhibits
restricted the general effect and increased
the danger ot uninteresting duplication.
Suggestions were offered by the various
gentlemen present, and it was decided
finally that it was the sense of the meet
. ing that the dried fruit packers and ship- :
pers* of California make a display at the
exposition, which opens September 14
next; also that a petition be circulated
among the dried fruit handlers asking
j for contributions to a fund of $2000 for ;
j that purpose.
An executive committee to handle the
; matter was chosen as follows: B. N.
Rowley of the California Fruitgrower, Al
bert Castle of Castle Bros., J. R. Hamil
ton of J. K. Armsby & Co., Henry Cahen
of the California Fruit Evaporating Com
pany and A. W. Porter of Porter Bros.
Company.
Mr. Stauffer stated at the meeting that !
be had had several conversations with \
: the railroad people and had been assured i
that in the matter of rates as well would
be done if not better than for the Ham
burg Exposition. He also stated that he
: hoped to get the winemen and the can- i
, ners together in a day or so.

LUMBERMEN
WILLING TO
COMPROMISE
Offer to the High Joint
Commission.
REDUCTION IN THE TARIFF
WILL ACCEPT A 20 PER CENT
ON ROUGH LUMBER.
Senator Fairbanks to Be Given an
Insight Into the Industry
During His Stay on
Puget Sound.
Th<- lumbermen of the United States in
order to protect their interests from
er possible attacks in Congress are
is aking a hard fight to have lumber in
cluded in the new commercial treaty now
b< Ing n< gotlated betwi en this country and
Canada by the High Joint Commission.
As the matter stands now. with every
chang' In the political complexion of
Congn SE, tin.- lumber industry suffers ma
tt rially from possible, if nol actual,
changes in the tariff. By embodying the
lumber tariff In the treaty it would be
taken out of the hands ol Congress alt<>
gether and could only be changed by the
abrogation of the, entire treaty.
This tt'iuli! protect the industry from
pi riodlcai ana ks. and it is to effect
this permanent tariff that the Lumbermen
re now engaged, in order to accomplish
thi^ they have agr< ed to a reduction of 20
per cent of the present tariff., which is $2
Per 1000 feet
The Pacific Pine Company, which in
cludes all the prominent mills and dealers
or. the < oast, has addressed the following
cnunlcatlon to every United States
ir and Representative <>n the coast
urging their support in the matter:
BAM FRANCISCO, Cal.
Dear Sir: Having since 1888, as represent
ing the lumber trade of this coast, taken an
active Interest in tariff legislation affecting
this industry, we have b^n request*"! to sup
plement previous efforts in the matter of prob
able consideration of an Import duty on lumber
from Canada and British Columbia by the
High Joint Commission at Its session In August
next.
I The absolute necessity of protection for tins
industry has been so completely presented In
past years that we do not regard it necessary
at this time to refer other than generally
i thereto, but would note additionally that as a
matter of equity such protection should be as
mii-'I to this Industry, inasmuch as every arti
cle used by lumber manufacturers has protec
tion to the extent of a higher pcrcentaKe or
th.- value of the product than the existing duty
on lumber similarly compared.
Above position of the lumber interests of the
i United states being conceded, the chances of
the renewal of Congressional agitation, or the
.prospect thereof, has a very disturbing effect,
and naturally the trade is desirous of secur
ing the permanency resulting from treaty ac
tion, and In event that the matter of tariff, on
lumber could be removed from the domain of
politics and made a clause in the treaty re
ported by Bald High Joint Commission, would
consent to a reduction of 21 per cent of the
present f2 duty on rough lumber. where refer
ence to this rate is had In paragraph 195 of
schedule D, "Wood and Manufactures of," of
the tariff act of 1887, it being understood that
such reduction shall not apply to lumber planed
or tongued and grooved, or said act be subject
to any other modifications.
Establishing the fact that this yew Is a con
sensus of opinion of the lumber manufacturers
throughout the United States (except solely a
very few parties who, during the operation of
the Wilson bill, became interested in Canadian
timber limits), we beg to refer you to the posi
tion already taken by this industry before said
High Joint Commission at both Quebec and
Washington, and particularly to the presenta
tion made by the Hon. J. a. Tawney, M. C.,
of Minnesota, and member of the Ways and
Means Committee, and to whom you may refer
for further di special information bearing on
this matter.
We would also bog to. call your attention to
the very active interest taken by the late Hon.
Nelson Dingley in support of the contentions
of the lumber manufacturers, and are assured
that If the matter were brought to the at
tention of President MoKinley, his indorse
ment of the Dlngley tariff would cause his
Interest and Influence with the American Com
missioners to lie on our side.
We, therefore, most respectfully request of
your honorable self that as a Senator from
this coast, and presumably keenly alive to its
best interests, you will make every due and
consistent effort to properly lay before Presi
dent McKlnley and the American Commission
ers the Importance of the action herein sought.
As Justification for the apparently premature
presentation of this request, . our views are
that all efforts should be with the Commis
sioners before the framing of the treaty, in
asmuch as should the treaty reported to the
Senate include a lesser duty, there would be
but limited time and greater difficulty In hav
in,.' its clause, modified.
Trusting that this industry on this coast, as
also in the United States (being the largest
and most Important manufacturing Industry
in all esentials) may have the full benefit of
all your proper efforts on the lines above noted,
and thanking you in anticipation thereof, wa
beg to remain, very sincerely yours,
PACIFIC PINK COMPANY,
H. M. HERRICK. President.
In Order that this circular may be bet
ter understood it is necessary to refer to
the late sittings of the High Joint Com
mission, when the Canadian Commission
ers urged that the American tariff on
rough lumber be reduced from $2, the rate
fixed by the Dragley law. to $1. This
proposition found fay_or with some of the
American members, including Senator
Fairbanks of Indiana, the chairman. Sen
ator Fairbanks is now en route to this
coast on his way to Alaska, and it Is to
win him over to their views that the lum
bermen are now working.
Senator Fairbanks is also a member of
the Congressional Committee that is going
to Alaska on the revenue cutter Hugh Mc-
CuUoch, and. is due to arrive at Puget
within a few days. On the way out
Senator Fairbanks spent a day with the
Minnesota lumbermen, learning- much of
the industry' In thai State, while he is
'in the Bound the Senator will he shown
as much uf the industry in that section
as possible by Senator-elect Foster of
Washington, who is â¢vice-president of the
St. i'aul and Tacoma Lumber Company.
He will be given an insight into thf mag
nitude of the forests or that region, the
output of the mills, cost, etc., and the. in
abllitj of th>- Americans to compete with
the British unless they arc protected. He
will !>.< given amplf proof that American
mills cannot be operated with a nominal
tariff of $i per 1000, and it is believed
thai he can be readily convinced that the
compromise suggested by the lumbermen
of 20 per cent reduction of the present
tariff Is as low as they can stand.
Senator Perkins states that h* has ro
cclveri the circular as well as other com
munication:- from the Pacific Pine
Company, and has advised that corpora
tion how to proceed. He says he has al
ready discussed the matter with such
prominent Congressmen as Dalzell Payne
and others, an.] has urged upnn the Pa
cific Pine Company the necessity oi hav
ing rate of duty agreed upon by the
nij-'h Joint Commission, for after thi
treaty is sent to the Senate there will !>â 
no chance to amend it. Tt will be adopted
or rejected as it is sent in. It is In accord
ance with Senator Perkins' advice thai
the l acinc lumbermen will exert their in
â¢ upon S. nator Fairbanks and Irs
associates - lt once, for the commission
meets again in August, and there is no
time to he lost.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW Y/ORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, . June 7. âA midsummer lassi
tude hung over the stock market during the
greater part of the day and the trading drifted
aimlessly in the loldroms. Wall street will
take advantage of a hot day to curtail its la
bors when there 1* some doubt about the out
look which compos eal what is called a waiting
market. But. though, the weather does not
deter the ever-watchful eye of capital from
availing itself of offered opportunities. The
burst of animation in the last hour of to-day's
etook market indicated that Wall street was
not so cloud â all the earlier appearances gave
reason to suppose. Speculation was almi st at
a standstill during the morning session, even
the professional traders waiting for action on
the :-ucar dividend and also on that of Ateh
ison preferred. The aimless drifting; of sugar
certillcates i>rior to the announcement of the
dividend and the srnallness of the transactions
seemed to indicate' that th- speculative com
munity was wholly at sea as to what the action
of the directors would be. The price drop]
bÂ«Iow last night's after the opening advance.
but recovered sharply Borne 3 points before the
new? became known. The announcement of the
regular dividend caused realizing sales and a
drop of 2 points. The shorts were so eager to
cover that the decline was checked almost, im
mediately and a subsequent recovery amounted
to about 5 points. The drop after the divi
dend announcement seemed to give the shorts
s.nip degree of confidence and the pressure to
buy was, not urgent at the advance. Consider
ing thf length of the bear eamprvgn. based on
an Implied doubt of the regular dividend, it
can scarcely |><. that the short interest has
succeeded In anywhere covering the lines put
out during the campaign. The declaration of
the regular ilivtdt r.d ha* by no means con
v.-rted all of the bears, who still nrgue dire
eift-cts fpim the trade war. The declaration
of l*- 4 per cent on Atchlson preferred was the
most potent in:luence in putting up prices in
the latter part of the day. though the effect
must 1Â»? regarded as surprisingly small, con
sidering the rt-cent activity of the bears on the
doubts they expressed that a dividend would
be forthcoming on this stock. The dividend is
called regular semi-annual and comes out of
the .-timings of the last fiscal year, with the
statement by the directors that sufficient re
ma'.ns lor another similar dividend in Janu
ary next. There was a large demand for the
grangers, which advanced prices in the group
from 1 to 3Â» 2 points, which spread to other
points in the railroad list. Fort Worth and
Rio Grande was marked up 4 points and the
X-". York municipal stocks rose sharply.
Stocks which have been recent favorites in
London, such as Anaconda and the Southern
railroad stocks, hung back under the influence
of depression in London on account of the un
ronciliatory attitude of President Kruger. The
iron and steel stocks also hung ba^k. Ste-M and
"V\ir<> dropping: at one time .'. points on pub
lished doubts i,f a forthcoming- dividend. The
obstinate resistance c;f railroad stocks to the
dff-llnt-, the present and prospective easy con
ditions In mone;- and the more cheerful view
'â t the crop prospects all contributed to th*
late strength in the stt>ck market

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, June 7.â The opening In wheat
was at a slight improvement over yesterday
I closing prices, July starting at 75%@-75%c, an
advance of % 1 ff%e. It was evident from the |
amount of wheat offered at the opening that
the liquidation of the past few .lays was not |
yet over, but reports of excessive rains in the ;
Northwest brought support to hold prices for !
a moment. The weakness of Liverpool, how- j
ever, gave grounds for the belief that the Rus- j
Â«lan drought reports were exaggerated and re
ported rains In the Odessa district strengthened |
this theory. Th.- result was. a short period |
of decided weakness, in which the July price
touched 74%c. This was the low point of the
day. Private cablegrams confirmed the seri
ousness of the Russian crop situation, and this
proved one of the most important factors. As
tlie liquidation dropped off a general inclina
tion developed to piny for a rally, and though
short periods of depression were of frequent
occurrence, notably when St. Louis weakened
on receipts of new Texas wheat, grading No.
2. yet the market, as a whole, was llrm to
the close, small declines being quickly re
covered. The first car of new wheat was re
ceived here to-day. July tlnally sold up to
75%c and closed tirm at 7a%&75%C.
Corn was again dull but llrm. July closed
',.' higher.
Oats were dull but firm with corn. Weekly
crop bulletins were bullish. July closed %@%c
higher.
Provisions were dull and practically feature
less. There was some demand to cove* shorts,
but cash inquiry was small. Prices fluctuated
within a narrow range. At the close July i
pork was 2%c higher, lard 2%c lower and tibs
a Shade lower

BOSTON "WOOL. MARKET.
BOSTON, June 7. The .American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the wool
trade: The market Is more .active and stronger.
Several of the large mills have boon reported
in the market anil they have taken, all told,
a considerable amount of wool, for which they
l<a(d advanced quotations. Certain of these
mills would have purchased more wool If
holders had been willing to make sufficient
concessions In prices. Holders of wool are
very firm, however, and as a result a num- ,
ber of intending purchasers did not secure all
the wool that they expected to buy. The
country markets continue excited, and the
strength of the situation is accentuated by the ;
increased activity and strength in. the gojda
market.
The sales of the week in Boston amounts le
5,598,400 pounds domestic and 565,000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 6.163,400, -gainst
a total of l.i: '.' '" for the previous week, and

Chicago led off with, a London cable of rain
In Southern Russia, which weakened the mar
ket, and there was heavy liquidation and short
. selling. Foreigners, ' however, continued good
buyers. A later cable pronounced the first a
fake, and one from Russia said that there was
no rain yet in the Crimea, that Barley and
Oats were lost, that the drought still con
â  tinued and that the crop was In a deplorable
condition. Unconfirmed rumors of rain in the

BUTTER. CHEESE AND EGGS.
Dealers are getting the nutter market all
mixed up, as they do every now and then.
Making contracts on newspaper quotations is
bad business and often leads to trouble and
confusion. Promising creameries higher re
turns than newspapers quote is another San
Francis custom which generally ends In a
mixup. If dealers would let the newspaper
quotations alone the market would be more
â table and reliable and better off. At present
those dealers who have made contracts on pa
per quotations and have promised creameries
an advance over the quotation! and them
selves confronted with a higher market than
the conditions justify. Stocks are liberal, yet
some dealers are returning let over our top
quotation.
One dealer put the situation pat yesterday
when he said that the market was legitimately
weak and Illegitimately firm.
Eggs are tlrm at an advance.

USE PRESERVES THE
TEETH.
The finest specimens of teeth are seen
in animals and human beings who
chew the food thoroughly.
Dentists agree that teeth must be
used to properly preserve them and
therefore they urge people to chew
their food thoroughly, but the nervous,
hurried manner of eating Is altogether
too common amonir Americana and
when fed on soft mushes they are liable
to swallow the food without chewing.
Dyspepsia and bad teeth are th re-
sult if this practice is continued. True,
one can eat soft food without detri-
ment if the necessity of chewing is re-
membered. Grape-Nuts are bo crisp
and brittle and withal bo pleasant to
the taste that the user cannot forget
to chew and thus the teeth get the
necessary use and the glands of the
prums ire made to give the Juices that
Nnture intends Shall be mixed with th.-
food before it enters the stomach.
These .ire not the only reasons why
those who rat Grape-Nuts look nour-
ished and well fed.

PARENTS TO SUE
JUSTICT LARUE
SEQUEL OF 'ARREST OF BOYS
WHO PAID NO FARES.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, June 7.
Within the next few days Justice Larue
will be made defendant in three suits for
the recovery of (299 in each case for false
imprisonment. The suits will be filed by
C. E. Kinard, as attorney for the parents
of John Souza, Jesse Alameda and M.
Medierqs, the boys who on May 13 last
were arrested at Sather station on
charges of evading the payment of faros
while they were riding in an empty box
car, bent on a trip to San Leandro to
â¢'â  asi upon ripe cherries. The boys, each
aged about 12 years, were haled Into Jus
tice Larue's court, pleaded guilty while
wholly Ignorant of the import of their so
doing and were each sentenced to three
days' imprisonment in the County Jail.
They served their time, and now their
parents declare the tables will be turned.
Incidentally, the new method employed
by Constables in their efforts to avoid "the
rule that precludes fees for arrests with
out a warrant was brought out in bold re
lief by Kinard's investigations. Con
stables, it appears, now supply themselves,
with a small batch of "John Doe" and
'â Richard Roe" warrants each clay, mak
ing them fit any case that might'"turn up
in their bailiwick during the day. Then
after an arrest is made and the prisoner
haled to court, his name is added to the
fictitious name as an alias.
"In the case of the three boys arrested
for evading their fare," said Kinard to
day, "the warrants were made out in
fictitious names. The warrants were first
dated May 8. This was subsequently
scratched and May 12 inserted, and on
these the boys were arrested. Later, in
court, their names were allased. But
don't forget the arrests were really made
on May 13."
The suits for false imprisonment, how
ever, will be based on section 9 of chap
ter 3 of the statutes of 1876, which pro
vides: "Every person who shall fraud
ulently evade or attempt to evade the
payment of his fare for traveling on any
railroad shall be fined not less than five
nor more than twenty dollars."
Plainly, there is no alternative provided
for imprisoning offenders of the fare
evading stripe, and the parents of the
three boys claim therefore that ' Justice
Larue falsely Imprisoned their children,
wherefore they will ask damages.

THE SAN FTCANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 8, 1899.
PRETTY WIDOW
TELLS HOW SHE
WAS FLEECED
Her Ardent Employer
Proposed a Ride.
ROMANCE OF THE SPRINGS
ARLINGTON GREATLY FEARED
ANOTHER MAN.
Talked of Great Wealth and of Rich
Furniture to Mrs. Minnie Smith
and Then Stole Her
Purse.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, June 7.
Mr*. Minnie M. Smith, an attractive
young widow, told Judge Qulnn this af
ternoon of a very interesting trin she
took with a reputed wealthy miner to
Piedmont Springs a few weeks ago. The
reputed wealthy miner. Mr. Arlington,
alias Mr. Hobbman, alias several other
! names, sat in court while the little widow
| told how he had played a very smooth
confidence game.
Some time in April Mrs. Smith was look
; ing for employment. Through a friend,
| Mrs. Henn, who resides at the Hotel
: Mcrritt. she was Introduced to Mr. Arling
ton. He is a fatherly looking old gentle
| man, with hair almost white, but with
; none of that vim and attractiveness which
; might be supposed to endear him to
I bright women. Yet this reputed wealthy
miner has a record of which he ought not
j to be proud. He has seen the Inside of
; the Alaineda County Jail, is not unac
quainted with the interior of San Quentin,
' and the detectives assert that he is known
elsewhere. In each instance the trouble
was caused by his confidential dealings
with a woman. His latest conquest and
probable defeat were told with much de
tail and very earnestly by Mrs. Smith.
"After 1 had been introduced to Mr.
\ Arlington and he had been informed by
, Mrs. Henn that 1 was looking for a situa
tion, he rather startled me by his first
remark. He said: 'I am a very plain
spoken man. Now. let us understand each
other at once. Is there any man in this
case?' I told him there certainly was not;
that I always acted for myself. Then if
| there is no man in it,' he said, 'we will
: talk business.' He told me that he had a
daughter whose welfare must be the most
important duty of any housekeeper he
, might employ. He said he was going to
furnish a house and had been recommend
led to look at a flat on Hobart street. He
suggested that I go with him to see the
I place and help him to arrange for fur
, nishing It. Money .was no object with
i him. and he wanted everything nice and
i convenient, both for himself and his
housekeeper and daughter. We went to the
house, and after satisfying ourselves that
it would be very convenient we walked
several blocks, when Mr. Arlington men
tioned that I must be tired and that It
I would be better to ride. An electric car
j was passing, and after we boarded it he
told me that he was not feeling very
bright and that if I had no objection we
would take a ride to Piedmont Springs.
I agreed to go, and as soon as we arrived
he saw some one to whom he wished to
speak, and left me on a bench for a few
minutes, sending me a glass of lemonade.
When he returned he threw a bag of pea
! nuts in my lap. Then he asked me if 1
; could change $20 for him. I told him that
j I could not, as 1 had not that much
, change. As soon as I opened my purse
ihe said, 'I will take care of that.' I pro
: tested, but he said, 'I'll pay for anything
that we spend out of it and will settle
with you.' I made a vigorous protest, and
he expressed great surprise that I should
ibe auspicious of an honorable man. He
said that compared to his wealth all I
', might have would be but a drop in the
bucket. I demanded of him that he give
; me my purse back, but he would not do
so."
At this point the widow's attorneys
promptly cut off her story, and when
Arlington's attorneys wanted to know
what transpired after the purse-snatching
they were also shut off by the rules of
â  cross-examination. In several ways At
torney Aldrich wanted to know what
transpired between the time her money
was taken from her at the springs and the
I time she swore to the warrant for the
arrest of Arlington. They could make no
headway against the court's rulings and
this part of the mystery was not divulged.
Mrs. Smith said the purse contained
$214 85. of which $20") was In greenbacks.
Mrs. Henn. who introduced the widow
to the alleged wealthy miner, was to have
been the next witness for the people, but
I she did not appear and the trial of the
case went over for a week.
Arlington's attorneys had asked Mrs,
i Smith the question, "Do you see anybody
i in the courtroom that was at the springs
when the incident happened?" and she
replied "No." Her attorney had her re
called to ask her if she had riot seen one
man In the courtroom at the springs, to
which she replied, shaking her fist at Ar
lington "Yes, certainly; I saw that gray
haired man there, of course."
AN ANGRY FATHER
THREATENS KEATING
YOUNG MISS BARNETT IS THE
CENTRAL FIGURE.
Oakland Office San Franctsro Call,
908 Broadway, June 7.
Somewhat of a mystery hangs over a
fraras that occurred at the Receiving:
Hospital entrance laÂ«t night. Isaac Bar
nett acknowledged to-night that he had
bei n mixed up with W. J. Keating,
warden of the insane, and said it was all
over hit; daughter, but he declined to say
anything further. Keating also declines
to discuss the matter.
Matron McDonald of the hospital heard
the whole affair and gives the following
version Â«f it:
"It was the most disgraceful affair I
ever witnessed at the hospital. I was busy
In the kitchen, when through the window
I 'saw an elderly man, Isaac BarneH. waU
to the sidÂ« entrance lo the hospital. Mr.
Keating came to the door and Mr. Bar
nett shouted to him that he was the man
iie was looking for. 'You have ruined my
daughter,' said Mr. Barnett, at the sam.:
time applying ;i vile epithet and mt. ring a
vile oath." Then the two men went at each
Other hammer and longs, and soon Mr.
Barnett's son came running over from
across the street to take his father's part.
Then the girl, who is about 16 years old.
came over, too, and appeared to take Mr.
K eating's part, for the brother grabbed
her by the hair and, nulling her away,
slapped her. Just then Mr. Borchert came.
hurrying out of the hospital and stood off
young Barnett. In the meantime a great
.'â¢rowd gathered on the sidewalk and in the.
street Young Barnett tried to blow his
iÂ»oriee whistle, but Borchert prevented
him. Later, after the row was all over,
( )flli-er Powers came upon the scene, but
hi ai â ! -rsts were made.

CONGRESSMAN KAHN
BACK FROM WICHITA
WAS DELEGATE TO THE TRANS
MISSISSSIPPI CONGRESS.
Congressman Julius 8. Kahn returned to
this city yesterday from Wichita. Kana.,
where he haa been in attendance sJt the
Transmississippi Congress. Mr. Kahn
represented the local Chamber of Com
merce at and was prominent in the de
liberations of the convention.
He distinguished himself especially in
his advocacy of legislation favorable to
American ships being manned by Ameri
can seamen. When in the course of a
speech he referred to the battleships now
being built in the United States and men
tioned the Oregon, the whole convention
rose to a man and cheered for several
minutes.
Mr. Kahn was also called upon to re
spond to the addresses of welcome of Gov
ernor William P. Stanley of Kansas, who
presided at the gathering, and that of
Mayor Ross, Mayor of Wichita. In his
answer he spoke of the great progress
made In the western half of the country
during the past half century, saying that
the history of California was the history
of the transmississippi States.
"The convention was attended by nearly
400 delegates," said Mr. Kahn when seen
last evening. "Subjects of great impor
tance to the nation were discussed and
resolutions favorable to the irrigation law,
merchant marine, beet sugar Industry, the
Isthmian canal and other matters of gen
eral interest were passed. Condemnatory
resolutions were also passed against coo
lie contract labor. Beneficial results are
certain to be obtained by the work of the
congress just closed. We were treated
royally and the visit will always be a
pleasurable recollection to me."

E. W. SPAULDING IS
TRACED TO LOS ANGELES
The Defaulting Insurance Cashier
Still Undiscovered â Belief That
He Has Gone South.
Since E. W. Spaulding. assistant cashier
of the Fireman's Fund Insurance Com
i pany, absconded the officers of the com
pany here have made diligent Inquiry to
ascertain his whereabouts. They are anx
ious to learn what use he made of the
sum of $7500 which represented the
amount of his shortage.
Detectives engaged by the company
traced the absconding cashier from this
' city to Los Angeles, but lost the trail at
: the latter place and have not been able
! to find It. Men with whom Spaulding was
! well acquainted saw him on the owl train
!en route to Los Angeles. Spaulding said
'to one of the men with whom lie con
! \ ersej on the train that he was going
! sr-uth on business for the Fireman's Fund
' ar.d would be In Los Angeles for several
days. It is surmised that Spaulding con
-1 tniued his Journey south, but the detec
tives have no trace of his movements
i after he arrived In Los Angeles. ,
H is the belief In the office of the com
pany that Spaulding took the money to
â  help a friend out of trouble and when the
person assisted failed to keep a promise
o' payment the assistant cashier was
bqi zed from time to time for the ad
vancement of the additional sum in the
nope that the whole amount might be re
covered in the end. 1 !i- sum of $7500 13

peatedly encored and displayed high vocal
; culture. \V. J. Hynes, in comic selections,
won the audience, and Miss Victoria
Orr's "coon" songs elicited much' ap
â  plause. Miss Juliet Turpin appeared m
fancy dances. Her Japanese and sailor
i dances were very graceful and novel. A
Cakewalk by Smith and Stetsen and se
lections by Professor Graeber's mando
lin, banjo and guitar class closed the en
tertainment.
At 10 o'clock dancing commenced, and
several hours were whlled away in a most

CHURCH AND BIBLE.
Father O'Ryan Preaches Before the
Catholic Truth Society.
Very impressive were the religious ex-
I ercises held last night at St. Mary's Ca
thedral under the auspices of the Catholic
Truth Society. The exercises Included the
Biniging of the hymns "Venl Creator "
"Tantum Ergo" and "Te Deum." Solemn
benediction was also celebrated.
Father Philip O'Ryan preached an in
teresting sermon on the subject, â¢ '.'The
Church and the Bible." In the course of
his remarks he said:
The Bible is not merely the work of thÂ«
j church, but the work of God himself, who In
i spired Its writings. There are three things
j requisite for a clear conception of the holy
scripture?, namely: That the Holy Ghost In
spired and moved the writers to give utterance
to the truths therm contained, He suggested
the things that were written and he preserved
the writers themselves from error.
To properly understand the Bible a divine
Interpreter Is necessary, and we have such an
Interpreter In the Catholic Church, who has
defended the writings from the attacks of it's
enemies. The church Is the official authority
of the Bible and she speaks Infallibly when
once she has spoken. She teaches what' is
! scripture and what Is not,' and It Is only
through her that we can arrive at a Just con
i elusion regarding the sacred book.

! for It until 9:30 last night, when she died.
I The body was taken to the Morgue and an

Three Burglars Captured.
Alfred Fenelius. Harry Sammi and Al
?|on Severance, three young men ranging
rom 17 to 19 years of age, are behind
the prison bars of the Seventeenth-street
station charged with burglary-
The capture of the trio was one of con
siderable merit on the part of Officer T.
J. Connei] of Captain Glllin's division,
who while riding on a Mission-street car
yesterday afternoon saw the three men
driving an express wagon laden with fur
niture along the street. He recognized
them as being thieves, and dropped off
the car and followed them along, when
he met Officer McShane and Imparted to
him his suspicion that the property in
the wagon was stolen.
The officers followed after until the
wagon was halted in front of a furniture
store on Sixth street, where the goods
were removed. Sufficient time was given
for the consummation of a sale, when
the officers entered the store and ques
tioned the three men as to where they
got the furniture, which consisted of
three tables and a dozen chairs, such as
are used in restaurants. The answers
given were unsatisfactory, and the men
were placed undtr arrest. It was learned
that the whole consignment was disposed
of for $5. and was stolen from First ;ive
nue and Carl street, Sunset Valley, a
place which had been used as a restau
rant for railroad hands until recently.
The trio broke into the place and carried
off the goods. The horst- and wagon they
had hired, stating that they wanted it
for the purpose of hauling some wood.

last night on complaint of Peter Ivanoff,
agent of the Vladivostok Trading Com
pany, and locked in the tanks at the City
Prison. His name was placed In the small
book and he will probably be charged to
day. Ivanoff arrived from Vladivostok
about ten days ago on business and on
Monday night met Harrington. The lat
ter made himself very agreeable and the
pair had several drinks together. The
rest Is mostly conjecture, but Ivanoff
claims Harrington put knock-out drops
in his beer and relieved him of $75.
Last night Ivanoff visited the Olympia
in company with a friend and a few min
utes after he had taken his seat Harring
ton entered and t'">k a seat beside him.
Ivanoff recognizeH his <iuondam acquain
tance and so informed his friend. The
latter advised that he have Harrington
arrested, and when the hitter leff the
place they followed. Just as Harrington
was passing in front of the Midway Plai
sance Ivanoff and his friend accosted a
policeman and had the man placed under
arrest. At the City Prison Harrington
gave the name of F. Williams. He denied
the story told by the young Russian, but
Captain Spillane ordered him locked up.
TO STOP THE FEUDS.
Men Who Sell Toy Pistols to Boy-
Bandits on Telegraph Hill to
Be Arrested.
Following the raid upon the boy ban
dits on Telegraph Hill Tuesday by the
police, during which a number of toy
pistols were captured, warrants were
obtained yesterday by Sergeant Chris
tiansen for the arrest of James Mearns.
1500 Powell street; C. A. Janke. I^l3 Powell
street, and '"John Doe," another keeper
of a variety store, for violating the law
in selling toy pistols to boys. William
Taylor, a salesman in Shreve's gun Btore
on Kearny street, who was arrested
Tuesday night for a similar offense, was
yesterday fined $L'O by Judge Graham.
The shooting of the boy Paul Balda
raceo by Tommy Crofton last Sunday first
drew the attention of the police to the
nuisance and Tuesday night Tony Bar
bini.-a boy living at 429 Union street, was
shot in the arm by John Flynn, another
boy. The boys form themselves into op
posing armies of bands, Irish on the one
side- and Italians on the other, and fire
their toy pistols sometimes with disas
trous results. The police are determine,]
to exterminate the nuisance, ami the ar
rest of the dealers who sell tin toy pis
tols is the first step in that direction.
Recommended Suicide.
Rev. Jay William Hudson of Santa Rosa
addressed Liberty Branch of the Socialist
I,abor party at the Turk-street Temple
last night. His subject was, "The man
with the hoe and hi.s damnation." He
alluded to the European peasant as the
model uf Millet's greal painting, and
agreed with Professor Markham that the
lords and rulers are responsible for his
"aching stoop.'" "Civilized individualism
If aggravated barbarism." In response to
the criticisms of some the speaker said
that if God Is responsible Tor the man
with the hoe he desires to withdraw from
connection with Him. and recommended to
the audience that mankind shall set a day
and commit suicide.
Judge Treadwell Indignant.
When the cases of saloon-keepers
charged with having nickel-in-the-slot
machines on their premises wort- called in
Judge Treadwell's court yesterday he con
tinued the cases for a month and gavi
each side fifteen days in which to file
briefs. The Judge said he had been ap
proached by friends of the defendants in
the City Hall corridors and in his cham
bers as i" these cases, but he wished it
understood that such tactics would not be
tolerated by him and he would do his
duty irrespective of the threats of not
being elected again or anything else.
To Enjoin Gray Brothers.
The "West of Castro Street Improvement
Club has decided to apply the legal test
to Gray Brothers' rock-crushing works at
Caselli avenue. At the meeting of tho
club last night it was announced that a
civil action would be commenced in tin
course of a few days, in which P. Rooney
would figure as ;\ plaintiff. The action,
while it seeks damages, also asks for an
injunction. A general collection has been
taken up to secure the services of an at
torney who will prosecute the case to a
linish".
Eagles Will Not Disband.
All is reported as harmonious in th>^
Fraternal Order of Eagles. A dispatch
from San Jose last evening announced
that the rebellious members of the San
Jrse Aerie had been expelled and that
riuit't had been restored. In this city tin
same course has been pursued, and the
r riginal order stands firm. The trouble
was the result <>f :he determination of
many of the members to create another
Order of Eagles on account of the reputed
had character of some of the officers of
the Grand Lodge.
Deane Off for the Mountains.
County clerk Deane left yesterday
morning for Tuscan Springs, where he
will spend his vacation. He will remain
at the springs until about July 1, and
during his absence his office will be con
ducted by Managing Deputy Joseph God

Donovan Explains Last Saturday's
Occurrence â Country Teams Are
Patching Up Their Weak
Spots.
â¦ â 
The only change in the relative posi
tions of the California League teams
during the past week is the slump of
San Jose. By losing two of its throe
Ramos played, both Oakland and Watson
vllle moved up ahead of the Dentists, who
are now in fifth place, Oakland being
third on the list and Watsonville fourth.
But as there i.-. a difference of only
twenty-three points between Oakland and
San Jose II will be seen that a single
pimp is apt to reverse the positions.
Santa Cruz still retains the lead by a
narrow margin over San. Franciaco, while
Sacramento is -till carrying the target.

The Senators, strengthened by big Ed j
Hutchinson at first, will "in. down here i
this week and renew their arguments with j
the Metropolitans. Hutchlnson has been
working hard since he signed with the
champions, and Is rapidly rounding into !
his old time form. Ed will be remem
bered as one of the original Texas
leaguers and the i ranks will welcome him
most cordially. In former days he was
easily one of the greatest first basemen in
the State, and although he had not .
touched .i ball for ten months prior to ',
signing with the Statesmen he says he
find* little trouble in getting back into <
condition. He played with the team last
â week and was an Important factor In win- j
nine the lirst game against the Mets. I
Harvey, too; is succeeding nicely in thaw- i
ing out his arm. and with those two men
playing their natural game the Senators
will put up a mighty Interesting debate j
with any team In the ague.
There is going to be an â .;â¢ sting time
nt San Jose this week, when the Lobsters
go up against the Prune-pickers. Dr. Mc-
Graw has been busy since Sunday in get
ting his men into condition, with most ex
< ellcnt results. The Orchardists have been
practically reconstructed within the past '
two weeks, and while their Individual
work is good, the games last week show
ed them to be sadly lacking in team work.
Take Leake and Graham, for instance.
They were both graduated from the ama- I
tdir ranks and put into exceedingly fust ]
company, and that, too, when they had
rot played since the first of May. having
be<n engaged in preparing for the exami
nations at Santa. Clara College. After last
Sunday's game both men were so sore
they could hardly move. Then there is
ODea, who has lust recovered from a
long illness and has had no opportunity
tÂ«. accustom himself to his associates'
style of play. Bui the team is working in- ,
dustriously, and not one of its members
has any fear of the outcome of the meet
ing with Santa Cruz.
Oakland will battle with Watsonvil

Ing at Oakland he lid not appear ai all,
but In the afternoon he came out In all

then he has been Bulking, and Tues
day Tuttle released him. Lannigan, the
crack pitcher ol >â  il >rd, has already
Igned in place of Balsz, so the team
â will noi be crippled any.
There is a dark plot among Borne of the
league magnates to lose Donlin to B
Cruz. They realize that with him in the
box the Lobsters have a moral cinch on
the flag and they would like to see him
out of the game in this State. Fur that
>n it is doubtful if any California
l>laycr has ever been so highly recom
mended to Eastern managers as has Don
lin been. HarriH has written to Jim Hart

In justice to Donovan, it may be Btated I
during th<- fifteen years he has
played ball he has never done the first
thing to warrant the accusation of his
g dirty ball, and Saturday was the
â  time he has ever received anything
pplause from thÂ« spectators. The
.â -.inks- -will accept his explanation most
readily, for Donovan haa always been a :
favorite here.
Dalrymple is the best thing in the
coaching line that ever happened out
here. During Oakland's las: Ram.- at Ban
Jose Mosklman was in the box when Dal
opened with his chatter and did his cake
walk. Moskinmn Ptood it for a time but
finally he went up Into the air completely
becoming so rattled that he threw down
the ball and declared he would quit the
same unless the umpire called Dal down
Jt was with difficulty that he was per
suaded to play the string out.
Pace Is evidently trying to work Tuttle
for more money. The catcher has given
out that he has an offer from Kansas City
and will join that team in a few days, as
he has not signed a contract with Santa
Cruz and is at liberty to go when he
pleases. Tuttle promptly called the
bluff and Pace will '"undoubtedly remain
at the sea beach. Â«
San Jose has added to its pitching de
partment by signing Kelly, the Santa
Clara left-hander. Kelly is a fine pitcher
and a hard hitter, as was proven in last
Saturday's game, when he put the ball
over the right field fence. He has not
been pitching any for several weeks, but
will be in trim for one game against the
I.obstors.
Krug w-ent back to short stop during
the Sacramento series and played phe
nomenal ball in both games, besides hit
ting furiously. Harris is well satisfied
with the team and says It can brat any
thing hut Santa Cruz with Donlin in the
box.
Kent is the most accurate thrower in
the league. If be was only stronger with
the stick he woud be the premier catcher.
Swindells is fattening his batting aver
age at the expense of all the pitchers.
None of them seem able to take Ins

differential on grain rates now existing be
tween the city of Stockton and Port Costa is
Just and fair and reasonable, and that no
cause or reason now exists which will justify
a modification thereof.
Wherefore, t>> reason of the premises and
by reason of the finding aforesaid, it is ordered
and adjudged that said differential shnll not
lifted "i decreased until th>- further order
oi this board. Thus ordered this 7th day of
.Tunn. 1899.
< ommissloner Blacks tock then offered a
resolution dispensing with the services of
all special counsel* and directing the At
tornej General to attend to all the legal
business of the board in the future, rum
missioner Ed son suggested that before
acting on the resolution the Attorney
General be Invited to express his desires
In the matter. Mr. Blackstock declare.!
the Attorney General had nothing to do
with the hiring of special counsel and
there was no reason why he should be
consulted at all. Finally, on motion of
Commissioner Laumeister, the resolution
went over until the next meeting.
Tin- .request <>f the ("p-scnt City and
Smith Kiver Railroad Company for per
mission to in<nase the passenger fare
between Crescent Citj and Smith River

: ot children.
Last right a little boy was found in
< 'hinatown amusing' himself by firing nails
ial chinamen with one of the weapons. It

A MEDICAL HERO.
Dr. F. J. Tillman Again Braves In-
fection at Duty's Call.
i>r. F\ J. Tillman, an Interne at the City
'and County Hospital, has (nice more dis

packed up bis kit ai the <'<>mity Hos
pital yesterday afternoon and affection
ately i>id his companions good-by and
started off for his isolated station at the

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 8, 1899.
T, H, WILLIAMS
SUES COUNTY
CLERK JORDAN
Wants $500, Money
Loaned.
THEREBY HANGS A TALE
REMINISCENT OF THE RECENT
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.
Jordan Bucked Against Burns and
Backed Grant With Varying
Luck âNo Note Is
Mentioned.
| County Clerk Frank Jordan of Alameda
' County had the interesting experience
yesterday afternoon of recording a suit
Bled against himself. The plaintiff is T.
; H. Williams Jr., who seeks to recover $600
from Frank Jordan "for money loaned
i within two years last past." Mr. Wil
j liams has Intrusted the collection Of the
i loan to Attorneys Ach and Rothschild of
; this city.
As soon as it was known that the suit
I was tiled politicians looked astute and
â  wondered why Jordan, who has been in
office for four years, should be Indebted
j to Williams; but they marveled more that
I Williams should resort to the courts to
collect it. Of course, the opulent pro
prietor of the Emeryville racetrack does
not nct*l $500, so there must be some other
reasons it was at once attributed to
politics, like everything' else across the
the bay.
It was recalled that last fall, about the
; time tli.- money was borrowed, Jordan
was making a red-hot tight to Bucceed
himself. It was more than whispered that
i Dan Burns was putting money into this
county to help the county candidates and
incidentally to elect his legislative candi
dates. One candidate, A. K. Urim, now
i County Recorder, swore to being told by
! Burns that he could not have the nomina
tion he sought, and on the strength of his
anti-Burns declaration he made his tight
and woefullj beat Charles Spear. Four
days ago Spear was rewarded by Burns,
via Governor Gage, by being appointed
a port warden.
Frank Jordan was also supposed to bi an
anti-Burns man, and was also an impor
tant factor in securing the election of
Howard Wright, both oi them coming
I from the same ward In Bast <'aklar.il. No
â¢ one can understand why T. 11. Williams,
the partner of Hums, should loan money
to Frank Jordan.
.Last January Williams was at Sicra
: mento working for Hums. Suddenly tele
grams came from all parts of Alameda
County beseeching the legislative delega
tion from this county to vote for Grant
; for United States Senator. [nquiry
showed that Jordan was working tooth
and nail for Grant, and a few days iat>-r
Jordan worked openly in Sacramento for
Grant. Of course this produced a cool
ness between Tom Williams and Jordan,
and when they met at the Golden Eagle
: there w;is m<>r.- of the glassy eye th m
, the glad hand In evidence. Jordan was
advised to keep out of the light, but per-
Bisted, and received much credit for
standing out against Williams.
a week ago The Call announced that
Grant had withdrawn from the tight Now
Williams wants his money back.
! "Some time last year Jordan borrowed
the money from me," said Mr. Will, urns
to-night, "but I do not. know what he
needed it for. Tie said he wanted it and
1 1.-t him have it. 1 do not car.- to say
any more."
In the suit there Is no mention of any
note having passed between the parties.
It merely states "for money loaned."
EL CAMPO REGATTA.
Rowing Clubs Will Be Well Repre
sented in the Amateur Events.
At a meeting of the regatta committee
of the Pacific Association, Amateur Ath
letic Union, held on Monday nicht the fol
lowing were present: w. <â . Espy (chair- 1
man) and T. Sands, representing the Pio
neers; J. R. Bockman and M. J. Calnan,
representing the ArieJs; B. J. Pembroke!
H. \v. Maaa and C. Pesoli, representing
the Ahunedas; A. I. Rothkopf and A. W.
Pape, representing the Dolphins; A. M.
Stone and E. M. Conloy, representing the
Olympics; and E3. Scully, representing the
South Ends. J. R. Bockman having been
appointed temporary secretary, the ap
portionment of regatta funds for the pur
chase of prizes for the various events
was made. Jt was decided that there
will lie only one prize for each event hav
ing not more than three entries and that
handsome silk pennants be awarded in the
races open to boys from schools in the
Academic Athletic League.
The officers of the regatta will be ap
pointed at the next meeting of the com
mittee, to be held on the 12th inst. Entry
blanks have been sent to the secretaries
of the rowing clubs and entries must be
made not later than June 19 at the office,
of A. P. Rothkopf, 20S Sutter street. Con
testants in all the events for amateurs
must be registered and must wear the.
uniform of their club. The entrance fee
of $2 per man must accompany the entry
and will be returned to all. starters. No
l*>at will be permitted to start without
a pennant at its bow. The entry blank
shows ten races, of which four ore for
barges, two for outrigged skiffs, one for
eight-oared cutters, one for whitehalls
ami one for canoes, while the last is a
relay swimming race.
So far as can be seen at present, the
Pioneers will enter Junior, intermediate
and senior barge crews and will have rep
resentatives In the junior skiff, canoe and
relay swimming races. The South Ends
will have junior and intermediate crews
nnd possibly a senior barge crew also, one
senior skiff man and two junior skiff men.
The Alameda club will send in senior and
junior barge crews, senior and junior skiff
nun and three swimmers. The Ariel col
ors will be worn by .junior and inter
mediate barge crews and by two swim
mers. The Dolphins will be represented
by two swimmers, one junior skiff man
and crews i" all three barge races. The
Olympic Boat Club will supply several
! swimmers for the relay race and possibly
1 a junior barge crew. Nothing has been
heard from the Tritons, the Boating As
sociation of the University of California
or the Columbia Rowing Club. In the
four-oared barge race open to high school
boys there may be crews from the Poly
technic, Lick and I^owell schools of San
Francisco and from the Oakland High
School. The PolytÂ«>chnic boys will use
t'n>' Dolphin boathouse and the other city
boys will be taken in hand by the Ariels
anil Pioneers. ' The Alameda club will
take charge of the Oakland youths. The
practice barges of the clubs will be used.
In the single Whitehall race for school
bo-, s the boats at Xl Ciimpo will be used
and the distance will be three-quarters of
a mile, Btraightawey. in the eight-oared
cutter race onen to the Naval Reserve,
men-of-war and merchantmen, two fr
three vessels may combine to make up one
crew.
CARL BITTER IN TROUBLE.
Arrested for Buying Government
Property From Soldiers at
the Presidio.
The United States military authorities
at the Presidio have been annoyed very
much recently by soldiers trading Govern
ment blankets, shoes, uniforms and other
supplies for intoxicating liquors. Re
cently two soldiers were arrested for dis
posing of a pair of Government blankets
to Carl B. Kitter, a groceryman whose
place of business is at the corner of Baker
and Greenwich streets. They confessed
that they had sold the property for 40
cents. The blankets cost the Government
$.'t 50. The soldiers were court-martialed
and sentenced to dishonorable discharge
from the army and a six months' term
at hard labor on Alcatraz Island.
Ritter was arrested yesterday by T T nltt>d
States Marshal Shine for violating the
United States statute that prohibits the
purchase of Government property from
soldiers. He furnished $1000 bonds and
was released.
Mr. Ritter denies that be bought the
blankets. He says that they were left
with him by the soldiers as security for a
debt.
WOLVES OF THE PACIFIC.
I Enormous Size of the Farallon Fight
ing Seal Bulls.
Deputy Fish Commissioner Al Wilson
and his assistant Mr. Green arrived from
the Farallon Islands yesterday morning
In compliance with the direction of the
State body and the order of the Federal
authorities at Washington, forbidding the
killing of sea lions. The men were hugely
disgusted over the order, for they had
not made any onslaught upon the wolves
of the Pacific. The females have just be
gun to come bade to the breeding
i grounds, followed by the fighting or
j "king" hulls of the tribe. At certain sea
! sons- these animals do not seek to es
cape from the hunters, even when shot
; at and killed by the dozens. That time
had not arrived, for the herd would scat
ter when a shot was fired.
The hunters state that at the present
time there are over 9000 of these animals
on the Islands, and still the bulk of the
regular herd has not made its appear
ance. Some of the bull seals, so the hunt
! ers state, are of .normous sixe, six inches
back of the ears measuring nearly three
feet in diameter. In weight these fellows
1 run over 3000 pounds. Even with the high
pressure powder rifles used by the hunter.*
the killing of such creatures is not at all
an easy task. The metal jacketed bullets
must be placed within a very small area
of the brain. Body shots seem to be of
no effeel and even when the bullet is fired
Into the neck of the larger animals the
creatures survive. The amount of salmon
that such a beast would require for its
food every day would be sufficient for a
small si/..-d town.
JONES IS ELEVATED.
Alexander Dumas, Formerly Assist
ant Cashier, Is Now an Inspec
tor of Customs.
Alexander Dumas Jones has been c^
pointed an inspector of customs. About
two weeks ago he was made one of the
three eight-hour watchmen over the Chi
nese at the Mail dock. Previous to that
time he had been on the Custom-house
rolls as an employe and was acting as
assistant to Colonel William Hamilton,
cashier in the Custom-house. When the
economical wave swept over that depart
ment last winter Mr. Jones was dropped
from the rolls and the colonel had to do
his i-wn work or pay Jones out of his
own pocket for continuing in his office.
The colonel, being rather busy at that
time, chose the alternative and paid
Jones' salary until he was notified by the
Secretary of the Treasury that no pi rson
other than a Government employ' should
be allowed to work In a Government posi
tion. Jones is a colored man and a very
competent clerk.
Collector Jackson denied yesterday that
Mr. Jones was on his way to his old
position in the cashier's office.
Woodmen's Reunion.
The membership of all the local camps
of the Woodmen of the World, as well
as those of the county of Alameda, will
join in a grand reunion to be held next
Sunday at Sunset Park in the Santa Cruz
mountains. The Woodmen with wives
and relatives will ko by the narrow
gauge and it is thought that it will re
quire three trains to convey them there.
The committee of arrangements has pre
pared a pleasant outing for all.
Gertrude Atherton's new story,
"C-upid the Golden," will be in next
Sunday's Call.

Many Leading Democrats Did Not
Attend the Session at Native
Son's Hall Last
Night.
Thero was a meeting last night of the
City and County Democratic Commlt
the organization known as the
Committee ol one Hundred. The ses
sion v.as brief, but its brevity % did not
obscure the fact that the members of
the committee have resolved to hold
last to the reins of power. Remon
strances and protests may come from
the groat mass of the unwashed against
th< i" rj etuatlon of the committee's au
thority, but no heed will be paid to the
<ry of the masses. Buckleyites may
rave, Harneyites breathe veng
and independent Democratic clubs re
agatnst unwarranted usurpation.
but the Committee of One Hundred will
not disband or retire from the field un
til another battle has been fought.
Only forty-five of the original one
hundred responded when tlie roll was
called. Conflicting reports a? to the
time of the meeting, no doubt, con
fused and k-pt away several members.
A few days ac" the Examiner an
rii unced that the meeting would be on
Thursday evening of this week at Na
tive S>ns' Hall. V- Bterday morning The
â¢ 'all correctly announced that the com
mittee would meet Wednesday even

Early in the week one faction of the
('invention manipulators prepared a
programme to brick all but twenty

was not sprung last night, for the sim

perceived by the Bhrewdest m
the organization that a factional *iL, r iit
before full possession of the works had
been obtained might lead to future
complications, hence harmony pre
vailed. The members were in a happy
frame of mind and became so delighted
Â« ver Larry Hoey's sty!.- of leading that
they gave him a recall.
Among members of the < "mmittee
who were not present last night are:

NO DEARTH OF FUNDS
FOR THE FOURTH
THE finance committee of the
Fourth of July Committee pot
together last evening at the
Grand Hotel to talk over ways
and means for the coming event.
The attendance was not as large as it
should have been and nothing of a
'1- finite mature was done and adjourn
ment was taken to Saturday evening,
when th,. chairmen of the different
committees are expected to submit
statements of just how much money
they expect to have use for.
Henry Fisher tossed a bombshell into
the meeting that caused consternation
for a few moments. It exploded harm
lessly, however, after having indulged
msiderable sputter. He suggest
ed that if Mayor Phelan stayed with
his resolution to not call the Board of
Supervisors together for another meet
ing before the first of the next fiscal
year the $3000 appropriated by the
f July purpose*
would not be available. The money is
provided for in the lax levy, but it re
quires action by the board before it
can be drawn upon. l T nless the board
takes the necessary action before the
end of the present year the appropria
tion reverts to the general fund.
Chairman Herrin quieted matters by
stating- that he had received a com
munication from Chairman Genres
Fletch< r to the â¢ Keel that he had carefully Investigated that point and was ao
sure it would come out all right that ho would advance the $3000 himself and
take liis chances on reimbursement. Mr. Fletcher's generous announcement
was heartily applauded.
The fireworks committee announced that it was planning to have two dis
plays one at North Beach, the other In the Missionâ and that it would re
quire il'*** for expenses. Its Idea in dividing up the display between the two
;> is made clear by the fact that the Market-street Railroad Company
will donate an additional $500 for fireworks If this be done.
Grand Marshal Costello Is hard at work planning his line of march and
the thousand and one other things that will come under his hand. He is be
d at every point by committeemen with ideas to burn and is finding little
time to work out any of his own. He says he has lots of time, however, and
that out of the general flurry he will guarantee there will coin.' one of the
most successful celebrations the city has seen in years.
flee holder for violating a pl< against
contesting the new charter.
A faithful tally of the roll showed
no more than forty-six in the basement
hall, but it was sufficient for tli* 1 sec
retary, who announced to the chairman,
â  a Quorum pn sent." Some old min
utes were then brought Into the light
Eter being read were approved and
ihÂ«- committee got down to business.
The Independent Democratic Club of
the Thirty-eighth District claimed at
tention first through a communication
pleading for proper precinct represen
tation in the coming primaries, it Is
the only fair and Democratic way <>f
conducting the primary, the communij
cation urged, and at that a solitary
rter in th^ middle of the hall ap
plauded vociferously. In the meantime
some '>n< moved the communication be
filed, and this was done. Similar treat
ment was accorded a communication
from the Registrar calling attention to
the primary registration now going on
at the registration -office.
It was announced that the terms of
all the Bub-committees had expired
and Braunhart moved that the chair
man appoint such committees as would
De necessary to take their place?. This
was satisfactory and the chair gave
evidence "f an intention to appoint th-
same committees over again.
A big voice in the middle of the hall
was heard inquiring anxiously if the
intention to reappoint the committees
included the campaign committee, and
it was found that E. P. E. Troy had
risen to make sure the old campaign
committee was fully dead. He was as
sured of Its demise and the voice
ceased. Only the standing committees
will be reappointed.
J. D. Maxwell then presented the only
important business of the evening. He
j had the following resolution which he
i read:
Resolved, That the chairman of the coun
ty â¢ â ommlttee appoint a committee rif seven
| members to prepare a plan (if apportionment
, for delegates t" be voted for :it the i-nsulni;
primary, and to prepare all papers required by
law; said t--<,mmltt<*e to report to this com
! mittee at a meeting thereof to be called with
in ten days from this date.
Dr. Beverly Cole forgot for the moment
there could be no repetition of the "pri
iriary" of a year ;ig i in the Democratic
parry, and asked some one to throw light
on the resolution. He said the resolution
went on to provide for a primary when it
had not been decided by the august body
hi was addressing that there would be a
primary, ThÂ«- first ;j,itt of the resolution
in favored, but the latter end he would
I hold out until the question of primary or
no primary hud been settled. Howard
Park called his attention to the new pri
mary law, which settles that matter with
out the aid of the Democratic County
( ( mmittee, and then after Larry Hoey
had imparted new beauties t" the docu
iii. in by reading it again, it wa.s adopted.
This seemed to be the limit of the com
n.in.es capacity for work, so one of the
Gallaghers moved that it adjourn. The
motion was eagerly aeconded, but a voice
halted the proceedings long enough to al
low Troy to propose some more work. He
reminded the committeemen that in the
last campaign every Democratic can
di<!ate was pledged not to' oppose the
charter in any way; he referred to the
suit now being brought against It and de
clared there was a Democratic office
holder in the list of plaintiffs somewhere,
and he wanted the county committee to
appoint a committee of three to investi
gate, report and perhaps prepare resolu
tions to fit so heinous a crime, that the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 8, 1899.
! culprit might be denounced in proper
form. His prayer was granted, and In the
> lull th.n followed another Gallagher got
in a second motion to adjourn until next
Wednesday. The motion was carri'-d be
fore any more work could show up. It
. was found the adjournment had been
taken without the appointment of the
committee of seven or the committee of
three on righteousness. Th< appointees
â  Â»'Â«] be notified by mail, however, so it
made no difference.

COMPANIONS OF THE
FOREST OF AMERICA
The Grand Circle of California in Ses
sion â This Jurisdiction to Be Vis
ited by the Supreme Chief.
Yesterday morning the Grand Circle of
Companions of the Forest of America was
called to order in the Alcazar building by
Grand Chief Companion Ira W. Coburn.
There was present a full delegation of the
representatives of the various circles in
the State and all but one of the grand
officersâ the grand inside guardâ were
present. The vacancy was filled by the
appointment of Maurice Rapheld of Palo
Alto Circle.
The reports of the various grand officers
were read and referred to the proper com
mittees.
The grand chief companion in his report
gave an account of his official work dur
ing the year, commended the relief asso
ciation of the order for the ansistance it
rendered the volunteers at the Presidio
and recommended that the ritual be not
changed, that the powers of the grand
chief companion be not curtailed and that
only those be elected or appointed to
office who have time to attend to the
duties imposed upon them by the laws of
the order.
During the year several circles, in con
sequence of apathy on the part of the
members, surrendered their charters. Two
of these were reinstituted and five new
ones were instituted. There has been a
gala in membership and In finances, and
ployment for a large number of work
men for the next six months.
It also means the employment of
more men on the electric road ami In
creased traffic facilities for the resi
deritfi of the outlying districts, as th>Â»
company, on their completion, intends
Inaugurating a live-minute service be
tween the ferry and Holy Cross Ceme
tery without a transfer. The ears will
probably be completed within six
months and are expected to prove the
handsomest and most commodious in
the city.
Twenty cars will be built thirty-four
feet long, and the other ten will be
twenty-eight feet in length. The cars
will be unusually wide for San Fran-
Clsco, but the amount of street space
taken up by them will be the same as
heretofore. The cars will all be fitted
up with fourteen rattan upholstered
spring- seats, which are said to be the
most comfortable for use in street
generally the order is in good condition.
The membership is 1719.
A vote of thanks was passed to Grand
Financial Secretary Mrs. A. D. Brelner
for having tendered the use of her resi
dence and that of her mother as a head
quarters for the order without cost.
â¢ The announcement was made that Mrs.
Sarah Storey, the supreme chief com
panion, will visit this city in a short time
and will remain here two weeks. The
matter of tendering her a reception was
left for the incoming executive council.
Surprise Circle of Woodland, which gave
up its charter but was recently reinstated,
was permitted to change its name to Mar
guerite.
A resolution was adopted to the effect
i that the Supreme Circle direct that the
, American flag shall be displayed on the
altar in subordinate circle rooms at every
meeting.
It was also resolved that the Supreme
Circle be requested to set aside a day as
memorial day in respect to the memories
of those- who have passed away. --
A motion to allow past grand chief
companions mileage, as is allowed to dele
: gates, was adopted. A proposition to al
â  low such past officers a vote in the Grand
j Circle was not carried:
' The report of the committee on honored
j dead was adopted by a rising vote.
A motion that will carry a proposition
to disband the Grand Circle and place the
membership of California under the juris
: diction of the Supreme Circle will be the
special order for 10:30 o'clock this fore
noon and at 2:30 o'clock: the election of
I grand officers will be the special order.
