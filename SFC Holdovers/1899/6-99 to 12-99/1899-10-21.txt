BRITISH TROOPS DRIVE THE
BOERS FROM TALANA HILL

Big Battle in the Present War,

Badly Wounded.
GLENCOE CAMP, Oct. 20, 2:50 p. m.â After eight hours of con
tinuous heavy fighting, Talana Hill was carried by the Dublin
Fusileers and the King's Rifles under cover of a well-directed
artillery fire by the Thirteenth and Sixty-ninth batteries. The
Boers who threatened the British rear have retired.
The fight was almost an exact counterpart of that of Majuba
Hill, except that the positions of the Boer and British forces were
reversed. General William Symons was severely but not danger
ously wounded. General Yule assumed command. General Symons
was shot through the thigh, but no bones were broken. He is
cheerful.

In "Shamrock Weather" the Amer
ica's Trophy Defender Again
Sails Away From the Irish
Challenger.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â Put away the (
cup and turn the key: cast it
away even, for there will be time
enough to mold another before the
lock need be turned again. Twine
garlands around the trophy, but scatter
about it ashes, for once more it is an urn
for ashes for hope, not the chalice of
victory which Sir Thomas Llpton had
hoped to lift.
Beaten at every point of sailing and in
every* sort of weather, there can be no
further doubt that the Shamrock is not
in the Columbia's class. One lone doubt
that remains is whether there is any such
thing as "Shamrock weather." That
which was apportioned to her to-day was
popularly regarded as the kind in which
the broad-beamed Irish cutter would show
to greater advantage than â  her narrqw
waisted competitor. But from the start
to finish, throughout the wild dance to
the outer mark, and throughout the dip
ping and rearing spray-beaten thresh to
windward there never was a time that su
periority of the Herreshoff racer was not
apparent.
"We might as well wait until Herres
hoff retires from yacht-building," said a
discouraged British yachtsman as he
closed up his binoculars and placed them
In their case. "There seems to be no use
in our building challengers so long as he
continues to build defenders."
Clean-cut as was this victory of to-day
j It was even more glorious as a spectacle.
Imagine two superb racing yachts sway
ing and staggering before a wind which
had the weight of half a gale in It, their
swollen sails threatening each moment to
bid farewell to creaking boom and buck
ling spar. Picture, If you can, the stream
of foam which came . boiling about the
flying yachts as, driving before the wind
and sea, they. rose buoyantly to the swells
to sink stern first Into the sloping val
leys that came racing after them. Then
home again with flat; sails, as taut as
drumheads and lee scuppers knee deep
In foam, one i straining spar and shroud
and sail and stay in a terrific effort to
keep the vantage gained, the other as
desperately striving to overcome the lead.
It was well worth the ten misspent days
the excursionists had squandered on these
.other lifeless efforts "at racing, and which
proved to be little more than days of fog
and calm and drift.
Straight out of the north a lively wind
was blowing when the two yachts arrived
off the lightship. The wind had a twenty
mlle-an-hour gait and the Shamrock, as
she dipped her green hull Into the sea, had
a now-or-never look about' her. It was
wind that Sir Thomas had been looking
for, and in it all realized lay the Sham
rock's last, long, lingering hope of taking
away the cup. In all other sorts of
weather she had been weighed and found
wanting. It remained to see what she
could do In wind of the kind that was
blowing to-day. â¢"â 
The start was at the lightship and the
course was a fifteen-mile run to leeward
and a beat back to the finish line. Both
boats were standing to the northward
under mainsail and Jib when the prepara
tory gun was fired. The wind was then
too bri3k for tho yachts to show club top
sails, but their working topsails were up
in stops and ready for setting. The Sham
rock's was ; sheeted . home three minutes
after the preparatory gun was heard, the
Columbia setting her staysails four min
utes later.
, At five minutes, to 11 came the â¢warning
gun, and â  the racers . headed for the line,
both Jockeying for position j and neither
gaining any decided advantage. The star t^
,_â  â - . 1
ing gun was fired, and the Shamrock
Stood across the line showing mainsail,
working topsail, jib and staysail. The
challenger crossed at 11:00:34. followed
one minute and one second later by the
defender. The Shamrock lowered her spin
naker to starboard as she crossed the line,
but Captain Hogarth did not get it set
until full half a minute after the Colum
bia's went swelling to the wind. On the
other hand the Columbia had not set her
working topsail, while that of the Sham
rock was gradually drawing that vessel
away from the Columbia.
Meanwhile the Shamrock's spinnaker
was giving trouble, the sail hanging in '
stops a dozen feet or more from the top- j
mast head. This ndvnntage was evened |
by the queer capers which the Columbia's j
spinnaker cut. The pole sremed "to be too ;
light for the great weight of the wind i
which the sajl was carrying, and it fre
quently tipped at an angle so sharp that â 
it seemed as though the spar would be up
ended. Once it went so high Into the air
that it looked as though the pole had i
been broken or that the crew were making
efforts to take In sail. Despite all the
handicaps of tipping booms and the ab
sence of gaff topsail, the American boat ,
continued to overhaul the Shamrock, j
Then the Columbia broke out her topsail,
and soon afterward the Shamrock's men >:
were afforded the same old familiar view
of the Columbia's stern which they had
so often looked upon before.
The wind held strong and true, and the |
run down the wind was as pretty a j
yachting scene as was ever witnessed, j
The excursion fleet toiling along on either i
beam had all it could do to keep pace i
with the winged racers. The gallant j
American was still in the van as the two I

neared the turning point. The jib which
the Shamrock had been carrying had been
replaced by the largest in her sail locker,
and for a time it seemed as though the
Irish cutter wnuld hold her own. but not
for long. In spite of the change of can
vas, in spite of everything that Captain
Hogarth could do, the Columbia steadily
drew away from the Irish cutter. Near
ing the outer mark both made prepara
tions for turning it. the Columbia taking

rock doffing hers half a minute later.
Luffing around the point, the Columbia
stond away on the starboard tack, fol
lowed seventeen seconds later by the
closely pursuing Shamrock.
The r^ad home \\,is the road of the
rough, and Irrimediati ly after heading into
the wind both yachts began a lively dance
over the tumbling sens. The defender
was under mainsail, jib and staysail. The
Shamrock, under the same sail, carried
a working topsail in addition. She took
that in at 12:34. the strain being too great
for her rigging. Over the decks of both
r utters the spray flew in sheets, and the
lower edges of their mainsails were kept
(inrk with flying- clouds of spray.
No need to tell here of how or when the
two boats tacked or how often they -went
about in thru long thresh back to the fin
ish line. Sufficient to say Thar whenever
one altered her course the other followed.
Tacks v,ere frequent and at irregular in
tervals, but each time the Shamrock
spilled the wind out of her sails, spun
around upon her heels and filled on the
other tack her crew saw the Columbia
still farther in the lead.
The Columbia gradually widened the
gap. steadily outfooting and outpointing
the Shamrock, and despite that vessel's
brave showing it became apparent that
she was not to win. This became so evi
dent as the two neared the finish line
that the conclusion of the contest was
robbed of all the sensational features
which mark a closely contested event.2
PARLIAMENT IN AN UPROAR
OVER WAR APPROPRIATION
Irish Members Fteht the Bill and Redmond Is
Finally Forced to Leave the
House.
LONDON, Oct. 20.â 1n the House of
Commons to-day the First Lord of the
Treasury and Government leader, Arthur
J. Balfour, moved an address of thanks
to her Majesty for the royal message call
ing out the militia. John' Dillon, Nation
alist member of East Mayo, moved an
amendment declaring lit- embodiment of
the militia unnecessary. This was rejected
by a vote of 2'Ai against 36.
In reply to a question regarding j
the rumored purchase of Delagoa
Bay by Great Britain, Mr. Balfour ;
paid no arrangements had been made
for such a transaction! Replying to i
a question as to Samoa, he said no d#cl-
Bion had yet been reached as to the future
administration of the Islands, and that the
matter was still under consideration.
The House having 'gone into committee i
of supply, the Parliamentary Under ore- !
tary of State for War, Mr. Wyndham. in- j
troduced the supplementary army eeti- j
mates. In the course of an explanation
of the nature of the call and of the man- '
nor in which the nation had responded to I
it. he said:
"The British military system. If it is
worth anything, must enable us to send
an expedition abroad without depriving
our homes of protection. We cannot be
satisfied unless we can send such an expe
dltlon without destroying the machinery
for maintaining our army abroad."
Dealing with the army corps now going \
out. Mr. Wyndham said it numbered 24,- ;
(H>J regulars, all trained and mature men.
Including 6000 cavalry, 114 guns, 261 wag
ons, from 9000 to 11,000 horses and 14,000
mules. It had been necessary to call a
portion of the reserve In order to bring |
some of the regiments to their full war j
6tr<ngtn. The Government therefore had :
called for 25,000 men. Assuming that 21,0 ft)
would be live â and this expectation
had been illy verifiedâ the British force ;
la the field would consist of 20,000 men
with the colors and 21,000 reservists,
â¢"This may em a large force," said j
Mr. Wyndham," but we must reflect that j
the two republics, by their juxtaposition, !
have a strategical advantage, enabling !
them to concentrate for attack at any
l>ulnt on a frontier of 2020 miles, a fron- j
tier everywhere hundreds of miles from
the sea, arid when we further consider the
area involved, which is Inhabited by 3,300,- '
ouo natives, it is clear that considerations
<-.f humanity dictate that the empire :
thould display an unmistakable exhibition
of strength to secure one of its greatest
dependencies from the horrors of dilatory
operations."
In explaining the organization of the j
enormous transport service, Mr. Wynd- >
liam said the reason it was not mobilized ;
Amid the shrieks of whistles the Columbia
swept grandly across the finish line at
2:^. followed six minim-? and thirty-four
seconds later by the beaten Shamrock.
This Is what Sir Thomas Upton had to
Fay about his defeat:
"We had to-day a fair wind and what
we supposed to be Shamrock weather.
The Columbia won on her merits, ajid she
is the better boat. My opponents have
treated me not only fairly, but generously.
1 have no complaint to make, and even if
] wished to iind fault I would not do it.
I certainly have it in mind to win the cup.
I must consult -with the builders and take
a few days to consider the challenge, but
1 shall challenge again unless BomÂ« one
else comes forward. If so, I shall stand
aside."
Mr. Iselln. when seen after the race,
taid that he had been convinced all along
that the Columbia was a better boat than
the Shamrock, and that this test In
weather" has proved it.
Captain Barr of the Columbia said he
thouerht it was a grand race and said fur
ther that he had never had any fear as to
the final outcome of the contest.
"As for my sailor men," he added, ' they
deserve all the credit in the -world."
Mr. Morgan was delighted with the vic
tory, as were all other members or the
New York Yacht Club. ,\ r ""-i,
"Are the dudes all here?" asked Mr. Mor
gan, laughingly, referring to some news
paper criticism about a multitude of coun
selors:. The joy that was on board the Co
lumbia spread" to that vessel's tender, the
St. Michaels, where each member of the
winning crew was greeted with a storm of
cheers as he, came on board.
Captain Robley D. Evans of the United
State? navy, who had charge of th pa
trol fleet; was the recipient of many con
gratulations last evening on the manner
in which the course ha-: Deen kept clear.
"I am glad." he said, that th( contest
Is over, for it had grown a bit tiresome.
The officers and men of the revenue cut
ter? and those of â  ie torpedo flotilla are
entitled to all credit, and if I ever have
another detail like this I will not want a
better fleet captain than my friend Cap
tain Roberts of the Manning."
Though his yacht has been beaten In the
contest for the cup, there is to Sir Thomas
Lipron no gloom in defeat. Throughout it
all he has conducted himself as a true
sportsman should, .id so popular has he
become that there is now a movement on
foot to present him a loving cup, a move
ment that is headed by former Mayor
Strung and other prominent men of this

of the Columbia and the Shamrock the
best encouragement they have yet re

By 9:30 both yachts were passing

If you are not entirely 'well, you are ill.
Illness does not mean death's door. It is
a sense of weariness, a " tired feeling" a
life filled with nameless pains and suffer-
ing. In 90% of cases the blood is to blame.
Hood's Sarsaparilla. is Nature's corrective
for disorders of the blood,
earlier would bo apparent when he de
clared that the embodiment of three army
corps for home defense and tho dispatch
of two army corps to a country where
facilities of locomotion existed would be
a graver yet a shorter and easier task.
By October 25 24.000 men would be shipped;
that Is. In less than six days.
The cost of mobilizing 4:." 1 " 1 men, trans
ferring them six thousand miles, equip
ping them, maintaining them for four
months in a land destitute of surplus sup
plies, Mr. Wyndham said, would be
Â£7 000,000.
"By dispatching these thirty-three bat
talions," he continued, "we destroyed
thirty-three machines for training men
and instructing officers in their simplest
duties, and we broke up the more com
plex organism of brigades necessary for
the instruction of general and staff ofll
cers. The Government, therefore, pro
poses to embody, thirty-three battalions
ol militia.
"We would have violated a fundamental
principle of our army system if we had
mobilized without militia, that principle
being that when all the battalions o: a
regiment are sent abroad we must call out
the afliliated militia battalion and form
a provisional battalion by welding the
militia and tho men under twenty left be

"Cavalry and field artillery are
strengthened differently. We propose to
raise seven cavalry regiments remaining
at home to a higher establishment and to
raise the nineteen home batteries to six
gun establishments. The steps 1 have
described will not be made to assist in
the war against the two republics, but
to put the army in the same position as
it was before the war. Such steps are nec
essary unless we are content, firstly to
exist as a nation on sufferance of other
powers, and secondly to allow to perish
the army machine contrived during the
last nineteen years at a groat sacrifice
on the part of the taxpayers, to protect
these Islands, and that train forces to de
fend the empire over seas."
Mr. Wyndham concluded with a eulogy
of the commander in chief. Lord Wolse
ley, and of the officers of the colonies.
The Irish members and Henry Labou
chere alone opposed the estimates.
Michael Davitt. Nationalist, character
ized the war as a "hideous and damnable
massacre." He said there had never been
such magnificent robbery by force,"doubt
less because the prize was the greatest
that ever tempted the cupidity of the em
pire."
John Dillon, Nationalist, thought that a
great country ought to be ashamed to
have to call out Its reserves.
William Redmond, ellite, vigorously
denounced the policy of the Government
and was repeatedly called to order by the
speaker for rambling. He contrasted the
attitude of Great Britain toward Venezu
ela with her attitude toward the Trans
vaal.
"In the former case," he said, "the

The Shamrock had certainly the better
i of the start, and with such a breeze blow
ing over her taffrail it seemed as if her
j chance had come to show her speed in a
run-down before the wind. In setting
the. Columbia's spinnaker the boom had,
be?n slacked so far forward that at 11:03
the sail lifted over the head stays by the
force of the wind. For a moment it
looked as if the sail would be split, but
by careful handling of the guy it was
; brought back to its position In a few
: minutes.
Those who expected to see the Colum
: Ma walk right away from the Shamrock
i were disappointed. Five minutes passedâ
! ten. fifteenâ and thfre was no noticeable
â¢ difference In the positions of the boats.
! The green yacht maintained her lead, her
! spinnaker remaining: exactly where It was
put and Fpiiiing the wind into the stay
sail, Jib and baby Jib topsails, which sails
had been carried from the start.
Captain Barr at 11:11. finding that the
Columbia was not overhauling the Sham
' rock to any extent, had the working top
i sail set. The spinnaker continued to be
have badly, flying over the head stays
twice In the next twenty minutes, thereby
losing seconds of time fur the yacht. The
course of fifteen miles to leeward was to
i bring the yachts down off Asbury Park
i for the turn. When they pasted the Long
: Branch pier at about ll;i>0 the Shamrock
was leading by an eighth of a mile, the
Columbia sailing directly in her wake.
The Columbia took In her fore stay sail
at that time, leaving only the jib as the
headsail.
At 12:15 the Columbia, which had been
steadily gaining on the Shamrock, passed
to her port, taking In the working topsail
: as "she did bo so as to be ready for the
; windward work. Her spinnaker came in
i at 12:1S and the Shamrock's was doused
i thirty seconds later. It was to be close
work at the run. Both skippers held on
their spinnakers to the last moment and
; then had been no chance to round either
yacht's main sheet. The official time at
! the outer mark was:
Columbia. 12:19:00.
Shamrock, 12:19:17.
Columbia's elapsed time from the start
: to this point had been 1:17:27, the Sham
rock's 1:13:43, showing that In the fifteen
mllft run before the wind Columbia had
gained 1:18. The yachts were only sev
enteen seconds apart at the turn. This
was Indeed close work after a fifteen-mile
spinnaker run.
Leaving the mark to starboard the Co
lumbia luffed widely around it, while the
crew hauled aft the main sheet. The
Sl::imrock's captain was forced to makf a
Btill widfr turn. Then, luffing up sharply,
he tried ? ri cross tho Columbia's wake and
capture the weather berth. Skl;>por Barr,
however, had a weather eye out for such
an fÂ»mprÂ£f>ncy. He gave the whlto sloop
a "North River" luff, placing her well out
i/ii the Shamrock's weather bow.
It took some few minutes to get sheets
trimmed and for both yachts to settle
down to business on the starboard tack.
Captain Hogarth gave the Shamrock a
good,* hard full, hoping to outfoot the
Columbia.
The wind was blowing at least twenty
five miles an hour and there was a jump
of a sea on, sufficient to make racing
craft do some rather heavy diving. They
heeled till the greater portion of their
weather bilges were exposed. â 
At 12:32 the Shamrock's topsail was
taken In. She was then throwing spray In
I ouds across her deck, making, if any
thing, worse weather of It than the
Columbia.
Captain Hogarth put her about at 32:40.
and one minute and thirty seconds later
tin Columbia wont about. This was about
twenty .minutes after they had rounded
the outer mark. The Columbia was then
between a Quarter and a half-mile to

the Transvaal has no neighbor like tho

Proceeding to discuss the vote of money
for the troops, Mr. Redmond again pro
tested against the vast sums being spent
in war, declaring that the money ought to
be expended in aid of distressed Ireland.
At this point the chairman interposed, de
claring that Mr. Redmond's remarks were
irrelevant.
Mr. Redmond persisted in his remarks,
and the chairman asked him to resume his
seat. This he refused to do and he was
then ordered to withdraw, which order he
also refused to obey. , r
An uproarious scene ensued, Mr. Red
mond attempting to continue and his voice
being drowned by the cheers of the Irish
members and cries of "Order!" and "With
draw!" from the opposition benches.
The chairman, at length, being able to |
make himself heard, asked Mr. Redmond
if he declined to withdraw. The latter re- |
plied that he did not wish to be discourte
ous, but he maintained his right to protest
that the money ought to be spent in Ire
land, adding, "I will not withdraw. It is
mere robbery or plunder."
The chairman then called the sergeant
at arms to remove the offending member, i
and Mr. Redmond, amid a scene of confu- ,
sion, Bald he would not trouble the ser- i
geant at arms and walked out amid Na
tionalist cheers and the laughter of the
other members. . - ; 1- â 
Turning to the Ministerialist benches as
he left the chamber, Mr. Redmond shout-!
Ed, "1 wish you joy of the blood of the
Boers and your victory over the poor
Transvaal farmers."
Mr. Balfour closed the debate by mov
ing closure, and the vote for the troops j
was then adopted by 200 to 35.
After an angry passage between Sir
Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, Conservative
member for the Ecclaall division of Shef
field, and Michael Davitt. Nationalist
member for South Mayo, at the conclusion
of which Davitt was called upon to with â¢
draw an expression characterizing a !
statement of Sir Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett
as a falsehood, Mr. Dillon suggested that
a vote be taken on the main question. He
would only ask. he said, an assurance of
the same treatment for the enemy's
wounded as for the wounded of the Brit- i
ish.
Mr. Balfour replied that the dictates of
humanity and civilization would Insure
that. Mr. Balfour then read the follow
ing gram from Major Yule, dated from
Glencoe Camp at 7 o'clock this evening:
"I regret to report that General Bymona :
is mortally wounded. Other casualties
will follow. The important success to
day is due to General Symons' courage
and generalship and to the gallant exam
ple and confidence he gave to the troops i
under his command "
The vote of Â£10,000.000 was then carried,
the result being announced as 271 for and

FIGHTING THAT PRECEDED
BATTLE OF TALANA HILL
T.ADYSMITH. Oct. 19 (delayed in trans
mission).âThe carbineers and border
mounted rifles, who have been In action
with the enemy nearly all day, returned
this evening, falling back fighting In the
face of some 2000 Boers. They were sev
eral times almost cut oft, but a Maxim
gun held the Boers In check. It Is re
ported that sixteen Boers were killed.
Several times the Boers came within 400
yards range, but their shooting was bad
and the Maxims rendered signal service
in stopping their rushes. They have a
larpro wat'on train and artillery.
ALIWAL NORTH, (ape Colony, Oct.
]9 (delayed In transmission).â The Boer
force from Smlthfleld has moved to Beth
ulle, where 2000 Boers are now concen
trated. Their plan of campaign appears
to be for the RouxvWe contingent, cross
ing the Orange River first, as they fear
the North bridge is mined, to circle
Allwal North and to seize the railway.
Simultaneously the Bethulie contingent.
It appears, la to cross the border, seize
the railway and proceed to Albert Junc
tion, there to meet the Rouxville force.
If this plan succeeds the Boers expect
the Dutch In Cape Colony to Join them.
The Rouxville force has artillery, in
cluding a Krupp run.

LONDON, Oct. 20.-The War Office has
received â¢ the following official dispatch
fn.m Ladysmith, filed at 3:30 o'clock this
afternoon:
"This from Glencoe: We were attacked
this morning at daylight by a
furco roughly estimated at 4000.
They had placed four or five guns
In position on a hill 5400 yard? east of our

artillery did no damage. Our Infantry
formed for attack and we got our puns
into position. After the position of the
enemy had been shelled our Infantry ad
vanced to the attack, and after a hard
fight, lasting until 1:30 p. m., the almost
Inaccessible position was taken, the en

ceived from South Africa leave no doubt
that the Boers failed in their endeavor to
execute a combined attack in Natal and
that the British have achieved a brilliant
victory, but at the cost of a 'heavy list of
killed and wounded.
The Boer plan, it is evident, was to hold
the force at Ladysmlth by demonstrations
; of the Free State burghers on the western
side, so as to prevent reinforcements be
; ing sent to Glencoe. The latter place was
I to be Isolated by cutting the railway be
j tween it and Ladysmith. Finally a large
force was to make a conversing attack on
, Glencoe. The first two items of the pro
i gramme were successfully carried out,
but the combined operation against Glen-
I coe failed, owing probably to the fact that
| the Boer military organization is too
I rough and amateurish to bring large
, forces Into simultaneous action. It is be
; lieved that only 4000 Boers were in the
! actual action. A report says that 9000
more were advancing from Hattingspruit
; and a battalion of the Leicestershire Reg- i
j iment was sent to hold them in cneck. but,
| as already cabled, this force is now in re
: treat.
The inference is that only the column
from the direction of Freiheid came into
: action and that the force from
failed to arrive in time and definitely re
j tired after the position taken up by the
! fianking column had been carried by the i
j British troops.
i Not an impossible explanation is the dif- :
; ference of opinion between the younger
and the older Boers, Where the former
\ were determined at all cost to push on
, and attack without delay, the older B Â»ers,
Who wished to wait until all the columns
! %vere ready, had fallen back to Newcastle
i and left the others to light alone. As a
result of this hastiness the Boers wen- de
ed ami lost a number of guns. It is I
c.nsidcred probable that the older Boers j
will in the future decide the mode of con
ducting the campaign and mutual recrim
inations, if nothing else, will hamper and
delay their future actions.
It is almost Impossible to overestimate
the importance of this initial victory, the '
i result of an engagement in which, in a I
| fairly fought field, discipline and tactical
skill have to!d heavily. Besides restoring
British prestige it has proved that the
I Boer artillery, whether directed by Ger
| mans or not, is practically valueless.
BATTLE DESCRIBED BY
A NEWS CORRESPONDENT
LONDON, Oct. 20.â The Daily News
publishes the following dispatch from Its
special correspondent:
GLENCOE, Natal, Friday afternoon.â
The first battle has been fought, and the
Boers have sustained a blow which will
give them a serious pause in their ad
vance southward. In the British camp last
night it was the general expectation that
to-day would not pass without some hard
fighting:.
The enemy had been reported advancing
In force, and this rumor had been cen
flrmed by a squadron of hussars which
had been sent out ti ter, When
dawn broke this morning it W
â¢ â¢nil that the Boers during the night had
occuplo.i a strong position on Dundee Hill,
about three miles easi and overlooking
the camp and the town. They had p]
several guns in position.
Almost precisely at 6 o'clock came the
boom of their first gun, and within ;i few
minutes they had developed a heavy fire.
Their practice was, however, poor, and
their sh"ts did 1:0 damage. In the n
time our own guns had taken up the chal-
It soon became apparent that
whatever might he the issue <>f the light
our artillery would not be in I
fire was magnificent. Within fifteen min
utes after our first shot 0 guns
were silenced. By this time the enemy
could be seen swarming over the hill out
side of Dundee and making toward the
south. The Intention evidently was to
turn our position.
An advance was at once ordered of in
fantry and cavalry. Both moved out, and
soon the battle was raging in the valley
outside of the town. A hot rifle lire w.is
k*>pt up by our men, no advantage offered
by the nature of the ground being
neglected. The advancing force was ef- J
fectuaJly covered hy our guns, which con
tinued to pJay upon the enemy's position.
The fire of the Boers at this point was
decidedly weak. It seemed as if their in
â  tie tive artillery work might have taken
the heart out of them.
Our men continued to advance steadily
in the face of their fire. Hid reached the i
foot of the hill in fine form. The I
seeing themselves worsted, fell back and
retired toward the east. Our losses have j
been heavy, but no details are yet pro- !
curable. The ftnal dash up the hill was a j
brilliant affair. The Dublin Fustleera did '
fine work. Nothing at this time can be
sa4d of the enemy's losses, but they must
have been very serious.
AN EXPLOSION KILLS
ONE HUNDRFD BOERS
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 20. evening.âDis
patches dated Maf eking, Saturday night,
arid carried by dispatch riders via Kuru
man and Danclskull to Hooktown, state
that Colonel Baden Powell inflicted a
tremendous blow on tho Boers nine miles
ninth of Maf eking.
Two trucks laden with dynamite, which
it was judged unsafe to keep in MaXeklng
on account of thÂ»Â» risks of explosion
Bhould the town be shelled, were sent by
nel Baden Powell nine miles out, in
thi hope that the Boers would shell and
â¢ splodi them. And so it happened. When
the engine had uncoupled from the trucks
and retreated about a mile the enemy
shelled the trucks, with the result that a
terrible explosion occurred, killing, it is
estimated, 100 Boers.
FRANCE AND RUSSIA
ARE NOW INTERESTED
LONDON, Oct. 20.â The absence of de
tails regarding the British losses in the
engagement at Glencoe Camp causes the
deepest anxiety, and the War Office is
again besieged by relatives and friends of
those making up the forces that took
part In the fight. Among the callers was
the Duke of Abercorn, who made anxious
inquiries.
It was reported that Great Britain's
immense military preparations against

two insignificant republics are viewed
with considerable curiosity in some of the
European capitals, notably Paris and St.
Petersburg. Notes have been exchanged
on the subject, and it is oven hinted in un
official quarters that inquiries will be ad
dressed to the British Government as to
the contemplated absorption of the two
republics by the British Empire.
The Press Association to-night an
nounces with an air of authority that the
Government's plan is to terminate the
war in the speediest possible manner after
tliÂ« forts ;it Pretoria and Johannesburg
have been razed, and then to promulgate
by order of the Queen in council a new
constitution for a group of five federal
statesâ Cape Colony, the Transvaal. Na
tal, the Orange Free State and Rhodesiaâ
under the title of the Dominion of South
Africa, the Crown to nominate a governor
general and the five states having power
< a. h to elect its own lieutenant governor
and to have local legislators, with a Do
minion Parliament, to meet at Cape
Town. '
"With some modifications the scheme is
I upon lines similar to those of the
' Canadian Government.
BRITISH TROOPS SAIL
FOR SOUTH AFRICA
SOUTHAMPTON, Oct. 20.â The trans
port Yorkshire carrying the first troops
of the special army corps for South Af
rica cast off this afternoon at 2:2), the
other transports following at regular in
tervals. The public were . from
the dorks during the embarkation, but
Immense throngs gathered outside, cheer
ing and singing and bidding farewell to
their friends as the trains passed in.
Between this and Monda n will
leave for South Africa. As the Yorkshire
parted the public cheered vociferously
and the troopa responded with vigor. The
commander in chief, General Wolseley,
with his staff, was present at the embark
ation.
LONDON, Oct. 20.â The British Chan
nel squadron has been ordered to proceed
to Gibraltar next Thursday.
MOBILIZATION OF
THE ENGLISH TROOPS
T>O>mOTC. Oct. 20.â The mobilization is
practically completed and it is said that
more than 90 per cent of the reserves have
Joined the colors. This is considered emi
nently satisfactory. The speed at which i
the army corps has been got together has !
excited tho admiration of the German
[Barters Btaff and they have pent a
i semi-official message of congratulation
- through the British military attache in
Berlin to the service.
The London press regards this as a well
deserved compliment, the papers point
ing nut that not only have the reservists
responded splendidly but the large ma
jority of those who have reported are
â n'ly fit for service. In several ras.\s
itgoing regiments contain a prepon
derance of reservists, most of them In
the prime of manhood and mpn who hnvr>
fought in India and in Egypt. It is the
aim of the War Office to send no man to
South Africa unless he has had at least
a year's service. The only serious criti
cism apparently to be made regarding
these thousands destined for the front Is
that the reserves are for the most part
ignorant of the mechanism of the maga
zine rifle. Efforts have been made to
overcome this nrd to give the men prac
tice with the Lee-Met ford, but the time
has been too short to do much. What ef
fect this lack of familiarity with their
own weapons will have upon the accur
acy of the fire of the British can only be
Judged when the dead and wounded are
j gathered from the fields of battle.
Explosives Confiscated.
LONDON, Oct. 20.â The Dnily Telegraph
publishes the following dispatch from its
correspondent at Cape Town dated
Wednesday: A large quantity of dyna
mite dust has been seized by the customs
authorities on board a steamer
bound to Delasoa Bay. The ves
sel put into Tnble Bay and the infor
mation leaked out. The explosives were
intended for the Transvaal Government
and were accordingly confiscated.

NEGRO BURNED AT
STAKE TO AVENGE
AN AWFUL CRIME
He and His Companions Had Tied a Woman and
Four Children, Saturated Them With
Oil, and Cremated Them.
CANTON. Miss., Oct. 20.â The little
town of St. Anne, twenty miles
west of Canton, In Leake County,
was last night the scene of a horri
ble tragedy v pequel to the .burn
ing of the Gambrel family the night be-
I fore.
Joe Leftore. a negro, who was captured
by a posse, confessed that he, in company
with oilier negroes, had tied Mrs. Gam
brel and hor four children to the floor of
the h'->use, saturated the surroundings
with kerosene and burned the unfortunate
j quintet alive. The negro after the con-
I fesslon of the awful crime was promptly
! roped to a stake and burned to a crisp
while the citizens looked on In grim â¢
nee.
Another negro. Bob Smith, was saved ;
Just in the nick of time, as some doubt '
existed a.Â« to his guilt.
The Gambrel tragedy occurred early |
Â«ame time. It is estimated, according to
â  advices received here, that there art?
Filipino troops, well equipped with
artillery, concentrated at Tarlac. This
, piped to be AgulnaJdo's present
I quarters.
At Hamliam there are said to be about
5000 insurgents. This Is In line with Mac-
Arthur's advance, and. unless the opera
tions of tJeneral Lawton at San ls>lr.>
have drawn the forces frum that direc
tion, General Mac Arthur also may meet
with considerable resistance. It was Bald
at the War Department to-day that the
forces of these, two divisions would be
augmented as rapidly as the new troop*
arrjve and that every town taken of any
value would be garrisoned and held. Al
though General Lawton has started out
with only thirty days' supplies, there Is
no expectation that he will have to re
trace any of the ground he recovers on
his northward movement. By the time
he reaches Tarlac, it Is expected, General
Mac Arthur will be in complete control >f
the railroad, sn reinforcements and
piles can be furnished both armies as rap-
Idly as needed.

will come soon if the three powers do not
come quickly to the aid of the Govern
ment and the distracted officials. The
three Consuls who were left here as a

Since last mail trouble arose at AJei
j in Atua. The Saleaula natives went there
and had a feast in their honor. At the dis
tribution of food some little disagreement
arose. Tuisila, the chiÂ»-i of Mutiatele, was
not present, but was In his own vtllftKe,
adjoining that where the feast waa held.
When he was informed of the dispute he
Â£"t up. w. ilked over to the feast and de
liberately struck a man in the face. 1 h>'
man turned to mm, as Tuisila is a hish
chief and was guilty six years ago of
shooting his own brother while he was
-â¢â¢â¢1 iii putting a child to Blet !>. E
that uni'- he has gone about surrounded
by an armed bodyguard, as his brother's
family has sworn vengeance. When fie
man turned his back Tuisila drew a re
volver and shot him dead, and- then did
the same to another.
A chief of the same rank yelled that
Tuisila should be slain. He was th-n
rushed upon and severely wounded on th'

He was brought to Apia and taken aboard
a German man-i f-war. Nothing coul<
done for him. He returned to his village
and there died.

WBiian tradition the death of Ex-Queen
Lllluokalani. now at Washington, is fore
shadowed. On the 7th. at Hanamaulu,
Kauai, the red fish that natives always
associate with a death in the royal fam

that they were- caught as fast as hooks
could be halted. The old superstition was
not forgotten on Kauai. A\ hile the prac

membered the traditional idea, said to
have been confirmed many times, and
they declared that death had again laid
hold of the royal family of Hawaii. Two
native women sat on the deck of the
steamer Ke Au Nou and walled, mourn

tune might prove to be. When the steam
er reached port there were anxious in
quiries at once as to what had happened.
There was no news of the kind expected
and now the persistent believers In the

TROUBLE OVER HARVEY'S
UNPAID LICENSE FEE
Residents of Sausalito Are Grumb
ling, and the Board of Trustees
Divided on the Question.
SAUSALJTO. Oct. 20.â The peace bo
confidently expected when the pool rooms
ceased operations here for the winter has
proved a dream. Joe Harvey removed
his gambling paraphernalia to San Fran
cisco, leaving $000 license fee unpaid, and
the resultant row originating among the
Board of Town Trustees has been aug
mented by a howl from the taxpayers,
"Hill tribe 1 ' and "water front" for "once
making common cause over what has al
ways been a hone of contention.
When Broyer and Glynn removed from
here for the winter that firm was given
an interest in Harvey's concern. Harvey
was granted a quarterly license two
weeks ago and conducted his business
five days over the last quarter. Marshal
Hannon was sent tg him to collect the
$300 license fee, but Harvey delayed pay
ment until he concluded to move. Trus
tee Crumpton was very angry at this pro
cedure and had Trustee Sylva see Harvey,
who said he would leave it to the board
whether he should pay or not. Sylva

PERFECT IN DETAIL
Number of Words Handled During
the Contests Approximates
Thirty-Three Thousand.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â Concerning Mar
coni's great success, the Herald says:
The work of the last three weeks may be
summed up in one wordâ "Complete."
During the days of the contests more
than 12<X) messages were sent from or re
ceivod on the boat Ponce and the Grande |
Duchesse. The total number of words â 
handled by Marconi or his assistants ap
proximates 33,0iM). It is not too much to !
i say that no mistakes were made. On j
I very rare occasions a slip of mechanism ;
I would make it necessary to repeat a few i
j words, but this did not happen, on an
| average, twice a day. The signals ex
| changed were perfect and were not af
fected by atmospheric conditions. When
attempts were made to adversely influence
these wonderful currents which carried
' Signor Marconi's messages the only result |
was to make the young inventor more
i confident of his own power. While the
' contests on several occasions carried the
sending station about thirty miles from
the receiving station at Naversink High
lands, at no time was the connection
broken. This, however, is not remark
able when it is considered that constant
communication is now being maintained
between two points on the Kuropean con
tinent separated by 110 miles.
The Herald had hoped to surprise the
world by a long-disrance record. Full
arrangements had been made to run out :
more than 100 miles from Bandy Hook to
meet the Olympia on her return and rtash
through the atmosphere the news of the ;
arrival of Admiral Dewey. But this was
prevented by his unexpected coming two
days ahead of time.
Marconi changed his plans as soon as
it was announced that the Olympia had
entered the harbor. The receiving station
at Naveslnk Highlands was immediately
installed, and after a towering mast had
been erected on the steamship Ponce,
Bending apparatus was placed on board
that vessel. The Ponce had the honor of
i leading one section of the naval parade
: in honor of Admiral Dewey, and while
the run was being made up North River
messages were flashed over the city and
across the harbor and bay, going and
coming between the Ponce and Nayesink.
The United States Government will now
take up the work commenced by the
Herald.

HONOLULU. Oct. 13.â A 'cutting affray
on tho transport Sheridan almost resulted
in the death of Private Retter of t'nm
pany D. Thirty-third Infantry. Private

i tion as to the extent of the injured man's
! wounds and many sensational rumors are

â  Some of Retti-r's comrades on the vessel
declare that he Is dying, and it was re
ported by those who were on shore last
. night that he was dead.
The trouble occurred over a game of
' craps. The men were "shooting"' on the
j lower deck and engaged in an altercation
I over a throw of ih>- dire. According to
! the accounts of those on board Snap slld
j denly drew his knife and attacked the
i other man. inflicting several severe flesh
wounds and narrowly missing the jugu
lar vein. Private Snap was put in the
i guardhouse and Rettor's wounds were at-
I tended by the army surgeon.

Hawaiirms Are Impatiently Await

ment.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU^ Oct IS.â President Dole
baa Bllppe'd away to the other Islands on
a vacation and to pet out of the way of
.further executive orders from -Wasbing
â x-mi; for there is a strong presentiment
:' ; .clal circles that there are others
: t c.
re is an Irrepressible sentl
â  in the community, even among the
â  rvatlye and non-political element,
that :i administration is
I'lannlng a coup de grace for the Dole
administration and that they will shortly
imoved by another order under the
Newlands resolution.
n is that Mr. Bewail will
â  id of

the con
sunamation of the plans of the military
tiaval branches of the Government
tarent friction

â¢ Â-:: Affairs Hon. E.
A. V.>'t-Sniith, a young man well en
rtth r hi:= world's good:; and
tnd free spoken
in lr is had the following
v :<-, the newspaper men in con
executlve orders:
It sooms to me thai the United States Is just
now acting the part of a negligent papÂ». For
my part. I should like to Fee more executive
< rders. so that we may be able to se-s just
v hir? we ptnnd. This In a point thJ Impor
tance of which cannot be too strongly eir.pba
?lrfd.
1 do n<-t 1..-lICT-e that the passage by thÂ» next
C'onprosF of a Ten-itt>r!nJ -bill for Hawaii La by
any means assured. We are Just as liable to t>&
Lung ut. liere t"or the next two or three years.
ThÂ«-re 1- no telling- what politics will do.
Of ccurse thip â â â¢in be a dangerous practlc?
for i>- JLTnlted States to Ftart. There is v sV'.Â«.t
i!'.fi v 1 --bet ween territory conquered. by force
of arms and territory ceded by treaty. If thÂ«
trÂ«ity jln.-.Â« is left out. then we are virtually
I !.'iceÂ»t before the whole world in the same posi
tion ar conquered territory. Would this be
rieht In nny way?
I believe thoroughly that the people here hare
always crawled too much to the Unite.! States.
There Is nothing that Americana like to s<?e
inure than straight out-and-out digging for
c:ie's self and a spirit of independence through
out.
Although Hawaii has been rather in the posi
tion of a euppHant I belifve an independent
iront would bave accomplished more
llott-Smith's father, Hon. J. Mott-
Bniith. served King Kalakaua as Minis
ter of tho IntiTlor in 1576. and Queen
I.llluokalani as Minister of Finance in
1Â«M. and was for a short time also Ha
waiian Minister to "Washington, and so
the young Minister almost comes to a
knowledge of "affairs" by inheritance.
Outside of the subjects of stock trans
actions, plantation promotions and im
provement, the main topic of gossip is
the political future and, more especially
of the possible candidates for the guber
natorial chair. It seems to be generally
conceded that President McKinley will
peek to conciliate rather than antagonize
public sentiment, especially as regards
the feelings of the royalist?, the Ha
wailans and the antl-anncxationista
(:mti-annexationists on accouiv of the
means adopted to procure ann< .Lion, but
by no means Inimical to the United
States). It Is openly stated that the ap
pointment of either Mr. Dole, or Mr.
Sows 11 would reopen old wounds and cre
ate most bitter partisan strife, for they
were the prime agents of the consumma
tion of the* wrong', still unforglyen by
many thousands.
These arc divided into three classes.
The first consists of the native- Ha
waiians or those attached to them by
family ties and position. They are the
ex-Queen, Prince David Kawnnanakoa,
Hon. A. S. Cleg-horn, father of the late
Princes Kaiulani, and Hon. Samuel Par
ker, who leaves for Washington on the
China on the 24th inst.
The next class consists of the planters'
Interests, represented by men of property
and Influence, and of many years' resi
donce in the country, or born therein.
Hon. William O. Irwin is placed at the
head of this list, with J. B. Atherton,
Senator H. P. Baldwin, Hon. P. 0. Jones
and Charles M. Cooks.
Tho third class represents the lawyers
nnd the names mentioned are Hon. Paul
Neumann, Hon. Cecil Brown and . ex-
Judge Hartwell, the special delegate to
"Washington.
The salary, $rjw, Is so small in compari
son with what has hitherto been paid the
Government officials that patriotism and
not pay would be ruling motive of ac
ceptance; but Hawaii is not even a Ter
ritory nt present, but merely a military
and naval station, with a government con
ducted contrary to all precedent and in
a glorious state of indecision and muddle

CHOYNSKI
TOO CLEVER
FOR RYAN
Australian Put to Sleep by
the Caiifornian in the
Seventh Round.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â Joe Ohoynskl of
California whipped Jimmy Ryan of Aus
tralia In the seventh round of their fight
to-night at the Broad-way Athletic Club.
Choynskl was Jar the cleverer and the
result was expected. Ryan was out
pointed from the first tap of the gong, and
when the knockout came Choynski was as
fresh as when he began. Ryan's previous
showing with Choynski, with whom he
stayed twenty rounds, made some people
bet even money that Ryan would stay the
limit this time, but the even money they
bet was badly Invested, as Ryan never
had a possible show when It came to hard
work.
In the opening round Choynski kept tir
ing with the left on the i.'a.co and Ryan
remained on the defensive, scoring only
one left-hand punch on the face. Choynski
kept Jabbing in the seconu and got his
right over three times, twice to the eye
and once to the mouth. Ryan tried to do
something at close quarters, but onoynskl
blocked every lead. , '
The third round was simply a repetition
of the second. Ryan opened the fourth
with a rush, sending a right swing to the
jaw. lie then tried a left to '.fie body,
but Joe straightened him with a hard lett
to the face. Ryan did some clever dodg
ing, but his attempts to land were iner
rectual.
In the fifth Ryan swung his right to the
ribs, but after that he did not land a clean
punch, while Joe kept up a continuous
jabbing of lefts on the face.
Ryan began with a straight left on the
face in the sixth and they exchanged left
swings on the head. Joe Jabbed a left to
the mouth and nose, drawing a little
blood. Ryan fought gamely, but his face
was badly battered when he returned to
his corner.
They mixed it early in the seventh, but
Choynski soon sent his opponent to the
floor with a right on the Jaw. Ryan got
up inside the limit, but went down again
from another right on the mark. After re
viving from this blow Ryan saved him
self from being counted out by a clean
margin, but when he regained his feet
he wtls so groggy that there was no pos-
Bible chance of his lighting any longer.
Choynski went to him without a second's
delay and swung his rigni once more to
the mark and Ryan went down on his
hands and knees. He lay in that position
as* if lie were paralyzed. The referoe
counted the Australian out and declared
Choyn'Bki the winner. Time of round, two
minutes and thirty-five seconds.

CHALLENGES HARVARD.
University of California After a Foot-
ball Match.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 20.â The Har
vard football team to-night received a
challenge from the University of Califor
nia for a pame to be played in San Fran
cisco on Christmas day. As the crimson
eleven will have Unished the season and
gone out of training long before that time,
and as the consent of the athletic com
mittee probably could not be obtained for
such an extended trip, the challenge will
probably be lined, but not until every
reasonable effort has been made by the
studf-nt body to influence the faculty to
sanction the trip.

BACKERS OF
SISQUOC GOT
A SWELL RUN
Two- Year-Old Ran Away
Twice â Three Choices
Downed at Oakland.
Of all the favcritea that met disaster in
the Bplashy going at Oakland yesterday
Bisquoc waa the most unfortunate. Tlie
1 Brutus gehllp.g rulÂ« d a 1 to 3 favorite for
the opening two-year-old scramble, and
i while the small field waa at the post ran
away twice over the course with Ward.
ilns naturally placed him hors de com-
t ',^, nd iJalir ;>x. an Sto 1 shot, disposed
of Ella dv J'uy by a ht-ad when Ferguson
; finally dispatched the buncli.
It was not a red-letter day for the tal
; ent, as Modwena and Rio Chico, aiso
prime choices, were laid away
Mat Storn started the Morello filly Mod
< wena for the iirst time In the second
; event, over the Futurity course, and she
must have been a trifle short. Better sea
: soned, Kootc-nai. with Coburn up led into
the stretch, beating the favorite out with
ease by four lengths. The Offering expe
rienced no difficulty in securing the show.
Lavator made his company in the mile
handicap look lik^ nothing. Picking up
104 pounds and starting a 9 to 10 fa
the chestnut horse made a gallop of it th.Â»
entire way. Lothian did not seem to fancy
the going, managing, however, to bes"t
I Judge Wofford for the place.
On his last performance Rio Chico did
not figure a great char.cc to win the
fourth event, at nix furlongs, but the
1 gelding was yesterday played for a good
thing. J. Brown again had the mount,
' and his odds fell from threes to S to 5.
Away in the lead, strangely enough,
Sink's entry looked like "Hawkins 1 horse"
! until a furlong from the wire, when Lode
star k>>i iii), and in a drive won by a
length. Ringmaster made a fine run from
the rear, securing the Bhow.
Old Lovdal, after many attempts, finally
won a purse. 11^ dosed favorite for the
closing seven-furlong affair, and overtak
ing Mike Rice the last portion of the trip
rarn^d the decision in a hard drive. Away
poorly, Frawley nstride Polish, the second
i choice, ran third.
Track Notes.
J. Brown, the rider of Rio Chico, was
suspended pending an Investigation into
the races of the sprinter Rio < 'hico.
The trainer of Lodestar was informed
that unless in future the horse ran more
consistently his entry would be refused.
President Thomas H. Williams Jr. r^
i turned from his hunting trip in the north

The California Jockey riul> has in pro

COURSING MEN
FEARFUL OF THE
LAW'S OBJECTION
Sport to Be Declared
to Be Cruel.
1
LOCAL POLICE WILL NOT ACT
â¢-
SECRETARY HOLBROOK'S HANDS
ARE ALSO TIED.
-â¦
The Condemning Decision of the Los
Angeles Judge Will Not Be
Enforced in This City and
County.
Local coursing- men are greatly agitated
over the decision of Superior Judge Smith
of Los Angeles declaring coursing to be
cruelty to animals and enforcing the pen
alty Imposed upon an offender by a Jus
tice's Court. The followers of the hares
and bounds In this city need not unneces-
Barlly disturb themselves, for the present
at Last. None of the authorities that
would have power to act will move until
certain other legal muddles in connection
with the case have bt-en cleared up. It is
claimed, however, that any citiz< 11 may
take action and have coursing arrosted
for what Is r.nw contended to be a law of
the State. There is no appeal from the de
cision of the Los Angeles Judge except by
writ of habeas corpus to tno Supreme
Court.
Charles Holbrook, the secretary of the
c ty for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, will do nothing to prevent cours- j
ing at Jngleside. He says that his hands
are tied by the directors of his society,
and whatever his own personal opinion of
coursing may be, he cannot act officially
to prevent it in this county. "I believe
that the decision of the Los Anj
court," be said yesterday, "is absolutely!
Just It is imw a law of the State that j
coursing is cruelty to animals, and any I
citizen may ,-irrest those who indulge iii i
it. Personally 1 have always believed
that coursing is a cruel sport, which i
should be abolished. I have consistently
advocated Its abolition, but the officers of
the society of which I am secretary have
decided that the sport is not cruel, and j
consequently 1 am unable to act. I have i
Been scores of Instances where the sporl
was unquestionably cruel, but my opinion, j
unfortunately, has no force. It is claimed
thai coursing removes a pest and for tills
reason should be encouraged. This may;
v true, but the hares are not a post !
In San Francisco, and their destrud
h< r ) under the conditions of coursing is !
cruelty,
'â I believe that the police now have no
excuse to tolerate the sport in this county.
They have the law and two decisions to
support them. "We have convicted men in '
this county f.Â«r rat killing, and if we can
do that there < ertainly ought to be every
prospect of conviction for hare killing."
Chief of Police Lees will also remain in- !
a< tive until there are further develop
ments In the case, "I am absolutely
powerless to act," said the Chief yes
day. "I am personally opposed to cours
ing, and would stop it In this county if !
I had the power, but an injunction has
been placed upon me and 1 cannot move
until it is dissolved. The matter will be
urpued shortly, and then 1 shall enforce ;
"the law as the courts interpret it. The
whole matter. Involving many more ele
ments than that of cruelty, is now tied up ;
before Judge Murasky."
The coursing men have their point of !
view from which they discuss the oppo
sition to their sport. "We base our case
on two points," said T. J. McHugh, Held â 
steward at Intrle.-ide Park. "There is no
cruelty, because invariably the hare is
killed instantly, its spinal column being ;
brol en, and in addition the hares are a j
pest. The residents of Fresno, Merced.
Ylsalla and other points in the San Joa- ;
quiu Valley speak of ML .T. Brawnlng, the !
man who traps all the hares for coursing
parks, as a public benefactor. He Is cred
ited with doing rood for the communities j
where ho sets his nets for hares.
"By the system now in vogue the hand :
of man never touches the hares used In 1
coursing. They are sent here in the boxes I
in which they are caught. They are lib- j
c rated for exercise, and when taken up !
to be coursed the box system is again i
brought into use. For real cruelty one j
must look to the rabbit drives when the i
whole countryside turned out for a holi- â 
day and killed the despollers of their
vineyards by thousands."
Peer Tiffany of Union Coursing Park
spoke In the same strain. He points
the history of coursing in England dating '
biick to ancient times. It has always '
been a standard sport there, being fol
lowed by people of highest class.

Wselly Gall $1.00 pr YearOdd Jtellows Ond Uheir Srand jubilee
CELEBRATION of the- golden Jubilee
of Odd Fellowship In California
came to an end at 2 o'clock this
morning with the final strains of
the last waits at Mechanics' Pa
vilion The closing scene was one never
to be forgotten. Outside was the cul
mination of two days' drizzle Into a
steady downpour. Inside a fairyland In
which color set off beauty while music
moved the mass.
At every stage of the celebration the
members of the Jubilee committee found
the elements against them and at every
stage they triumphed, plucking more than
magnificent results out of almost absolute
impossibility. Clouds threatened their
parade. Some were on the point of post
poning it, but the majority voted to go
ahead, and go ahead they did. Resultr-the
most noteworthy civic parade ever given
In the city by any organizationâ con
taining so many striking features that It
would be useless to name them all. In the
evening the competitive drills were sched
uled to take place. The drizzle came down
eteadily and late In the afternoon It
seemed as if it would be hard work to
draw a corporal's guard to the Pavilion.
At S o'clock the 6000 seats were filled and
still the crowds were passing through the
doors. How many succeeded In getting In
is not known, but It Is safe to say that
not less than 10,000 people witnessed the
competition and exhibition.
It was with a feeling of regret that the
committee felt compelled to admit the po
tency of the weather man to the extent
of calling oft the excursion and picnic to
El Campo, billed yesterday, and substitut
ing in its place a concert at the Pavilion,
during the intervals of which the games
arranged would be contested. Their feel-
Ing of regret was turned to glee before
half of the programme had been carried
through. The Indoor picnic was a success
in every particular. No less than 4000 peo
ple braved the storm to take part in It.
and they made things go with a whoop
â¢hat did good the hearts of me commlttee
inen.
After all these nice things that could
be directly attributed to the rain the Odd
Fellows began to feel rather friendly to
J. Pluvius and made up their minds that
he was going to do them Just one more
big favor before he quit and that was to
keep up his lick during the afternoon to
prevent an uncomfortable crowding on
the dancers at the Pavilion during the
â¢night. Almost before the wish had been
formed the ruin god began to gratify it.
Down came the drops harder and harder,
until at 7 o'clock in the evening it seemed
a certainty (hat there would be no crowd
ing on the big floor.
Once again the rain proved powerless to
deter the Odd Fellows and their friends
from flocking to the big structure. The
vast crowd of the night before was almost
duplicated. There might have been a thou
sand less than on the occasion of the
competitive drill, but it was not missed.
The number of dancing jubilants could
have been cut in half and still there would
have been lack of comfortable elbow room
In which to dance.
These are a few of the things upon
which the Odd Fellows of California can
look back and of which they can feel
proud, and of which they do.
The programme last evening opened
with several concert numbers by the
band, during the course of which the Pa
triarchs Militant and the Rebekah drill
corps thai had participated in the exhibi
tions of the night tore marched onto the
Iloor. again to draw shouts of admiration
from the onlookinpr thousands. After be
ing marched In review they were drawn
up before Grand Scribe \V. H. Barnes,
who was to present the prizes.
The decision of the judges was that
Canton Ridgeley No. 13 of Stockton had
earned first' place. Grand Scribe Barnes
d-livered to Captain W. Bruce the first
prize consisting of a check for $100 and
the Grand Encampment trophy, a beauti
ful vase. Canton No. 1. Sacramento, got
second place and a check for $l;-0. In de
livering the prizes Grand Scribe Barnes
announced that the judgv.s had found only
a trifling difference Fn the work of the two
teams, but he reminded them that trifles
made perfection. _ â¢ .-

and at times during the afternoon the
seating capacity of the big interior was
on the point of being severely tested.
The games that had been arranged as
part of the attractions for the outdoor
picnic were very cleverly contested on the
main floor of the Pavilion, and those who
did not participate shook their sides
laughing at the efforts of fat men ajid
fat women to annex race prizes. There
were bowling contests and ring tossing,
bean bag events and races for all sorts
of men. women and children. Patriarchs
Militant raced over the waxed floor as if
thÂ«y were trying to beat the Columbia;
Bhapely Rebekahs gathered their skirts !n
their hands and sprinted for dear life; no
ble grands ran like deer, and some of

went merry as a marriage bell.
In the intervals between events the
band played dance music and those who
desired to danced. It wasn't El Campo,
but it was very pleasant. The commit
tees in charge 'of the various contests
were made up of the following: Bowling,

dancers and Paul Petlnl warn accorded the
honors for his rendition of airs from
Italian operas In the original tongue. The
Inimical Chinese songs and re, Itations by
Tommy Naylor were highly appreciated
Several politicians called during the
evening, but they did not get In their

and make a few "Irrelevant remarks."
At the conclusion Secretary Clancy was

At the end of the fiscal year the divi

EASTERN STAR CHAPTER
ELECTS NEW OFFICERS
THE greater part of the session of the
Grand Chapter, Order Eastern Star,
on Thursday was taken up in the dis
cussion of matters that were recom
mended in the reports.
A motion was made that the Grand
Chapter create the office of honorary
worthy past grand patron and confer the
same upon William S. Moses, the father
of the Order of Eastern Star in Califor
nia, but it was discovered that this could
be done only by an amendment to the con
stitution, and to bring about this result a
committee wan appointed to present a
suitable amendment. It was also pro
vided that the office shall be only during
the lifetime of Mr. Moses.
An Invitation was received from the
chapter in San .lose asking that the next
session of the Grand chapter he held in
the Garden < "It;, of California.
In the afternoon there was the election
for grand officers for the ensuing term.
George L. Darling, associate grand pa
tron, a mernlxr of Golden Gate Chapter of
this city, who during his term was a very
active officer, was elected worthy grand
patron; Mrs. Fannie T. McCowen of King

Maria was elected associate matron.
In the evening the officers of Ivy Chap
ter exemplified the work in King Solo
mon's Hall in Masonic Temple by initiat
ing two candiUai.es in the presence of the
Grand Chapter, and the work was done
with the correctness for which this chap
ter is noted.
At the session yesterday the report that
the constitution be amended so that the
grand master instead of the grand patron
should preside at all sessions of the Grand

as in the past.
Mrs. Kate Josephine Willats was paid
the compliment oi a re-election as grand
secretary. Mrs. Isabel Vawter of Santa

It was also decided that in future, when
an investigation is ordered to inquire into
any charges that may be brought against
a member of a subordinate chapter, that
the subordinate chapter must bear all the
expense.
The committee to which was referred
the matter of creating an office for Wil
liam S. Moses, the founder of the order
in this State, presented a report that he
be elected a life member or the Grand
Chapter, with the honors of past grand
patron, and it was adopted.

MUST STAMP TRUNK RECEIPTS.
New Ruling of the Internal Revenue
Department.
According to the nevt ruling of the In
ternal Revenue Bureau, transfer com
panies will be obliged to put a stamp on
all receipts for trunks which are taken up
In one city and delivered in another. This
ruling will apply especially to cases where
the trunk checks are turned over to the
express companies and delivered in near
by cities on wagons owned and controlled
by the companies.
The attention of the Revenue Bureau in
Washington was called to the method
adopted by transfer companies in the
various cities regarding the delivery of a
trunk from a house or hotel in one city
to B residence fir hotel in another city
without the receipt being stamped. Order's
have been issued to internal revenue offi
cers to Investigate the transfer companies
In their districts, and Collector Lynch will
instruct division deputies to see that the
law is enforced. The tax is 1 cent on
each receipt, and amounts to a large sum
in the aggregate.
Superintendent Graham of the People's
Express Company, in discussing the rul
i'lsr yesterday, said:
"we have always endeavored to comply
with the law regarding the stamping of
receipts which we give for parcels and
trunks. In <\:ses where we pick up the
baggage in this city and transfer it to
Oakland, Alameda or Berkeley on our
wagons which cross the ferries' we have
always put a stamp upon the receipt In
cases, however, where the check for the
trunk is turned over to us by other com
panies which collect them "on Incoming
steamers, we have not been in .the habit
of stamping the receipt for the check
where we transfer the packages to near
by cities. If the decision covers this kind
of receipt we will certainly comply with
the ruling."

of Vessels coming from for<M Kn ports

GREET FUNSTON
Chapel Crowded to the
Doors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 20.â
General Frederick Funston was given a
musing reception by the students of
Stanford University when he addressed
them in the chapel this afternoon. Only
the faculty and students were admitted,
but they "filled all the available space,
while others anxiously waited outside.
While in favor of relentlessly prosecut-
Ing the war. now that it has been started,
General Funston is not upon principle an
out and out expansionist. In his remarks
to the students he reviewed the history
of the events which happened after his
arrival up to the time of the breaking out
of hostilities. Continuing, he spoke in
part as follows:
Our war never hns been with the Filipinos
as a nrtion. for they are divided into various
tribes speaking llfteen or twenty different
tongues, but with the Tagalos, who are the
most advanced of all the natives and occupy
the southern part of the islands. Their leaders
are young politicians, between 20 and 30 years
of age. ambitious and unscrupulous to the high
est decree. They have everything- to gain and
nothing to lose, and run their game with a cun
nlThere"V no use in discussing expansion or
anti-expansion, for few of us believe in run
nine about the world annexing foreign terri
tories but now thnt we are In the country and
have 'lost so many men we must thoroughly
thrash every tribe that resists American au
thority With an army of 70.000 men, such as
we have there now. I believe it can be done
THE EMPORIUM.
by next March, if an active campaign is pur
sued. When this is once done I think, tl.o
Filinincs will make loyal Americans.
Much criticism of the conduct of the war has
be?n made In the papers, and often things have
been done which I have thought to be unwise.
However, all I know is that General Otis Is
my superior officer, and I have a feeling that a.
man who was a major general almost before
I was born must know better how to do things
than I do.
When the Islands are finally conquered the
most difficult task is still to follow. Whoever
is President of these United States may he be
wise enough to place at the head of the colon
ial government down there a man of the high
est integrity and not one whose only recom
mendation is a political pull. Americans should
be mixed with Filipinos In the government, and
every remnant of Spanish law wiped from, the
statute books.
General Funston refuted the charges nf
bad conduct and cruelty which irresponsi
ble camp followers had made, saying that
in his experience he had not seen a Fili
pino soldier treated in any unkind way,
and that there were more wounded Fili
pinos in Amerioan hospitals than there
were American soldiers. He termed the
Islands thf richest undeveloped country
in the world, with 112,000 square miles of
tillable land, beside? rich mines and for
ests of hard wood, predicting that in tea
or fifteen years they would become an
cther Ceylon or Java.
General and Mrs. Funston were given a
reception to-night at the residence of
President Jordan by the Stanford Chap
ter of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
About 200 guests were present, including
people prominent in both social and col
lege affairs, making the event one of the
most pleasant of the year "With General
Funston was Chancellor F. H. Snow,
head of the University of Kansas, from
which institution the general is a grad
uate.
Death of Mrs. Rea.
GIT.ROY. Oct. 20.â The sudden death of
Mrs. Mary Ann Rea, beloved wife of
Hon. Thomas Rea and mother of James
W.. Supervisor George E. and Carrie Rea,
Mrs. Louis Larpe of San Jose, Mrs. Adda
Strange of San Francisco and Mrs. Clara
Hunna of Berkeley, has cast a gloom over
the community. She had resided In the
Oilroy Valley since 1853. Her death was
unexpected and was due to neuralgia of
the heart.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1599.
BARRETT DISPLEASED.
IT seems by reports from the East that the Hon.
Barrett was displeased with our people
during his tour on this coast as an Asiatic com
mercial expert.
He has taken our commercial classes severely to
task is them up as victims to obtuseness of
mind and lethargy of enterprise.
This is a mood of mind common to gentlemen who
fall into the habit of considering themselves "the whole
thing." They are apt to conclude that indifference
to their treatment of a subject is indifference to the
subject itself. If an expert apostle of trade should
come, telling us that expansion of our commerce
depends on a study of the moon, or that the profits
of deep water trade are dominated by the <- : rrn of
the Zodiac in which we go down to the sea in ships,
it could not well be charged that we don't want
trade because we failed to be enthusiastic over its
lunar or zodiacal aspect.
The New York Journal of Commerce voices Mr.
Barrett's displeasure with the coast in a long edi
torial which swings into the great cycles of com
mercial development and sees mystery in the natural
process of producing a surplus and finding a mar
ket lor it. The trade of this coast has risen with the
increase in the surplus products of its labor. As far
rnia is concerned the swell has been more
: than in the case of other States because of the
great variety of our products and resources. New
York had been under exploitation two centuries
nearly before it had a volume of external trade equal
to that enjoyed by California as the result of fifty
years of development. Yet the Journal of Com
merce, voicing Mr. Barrett, says that until the Pacific
States wake up "there will be a poor prospect for
those States to enter into the magnificent heritage
which nature has prepared for them." The nature
of that heritage is then stated as having been
pointed out by an English writer. This Englishman
says: "At present the greater part of the trade be
tween the United States and China is conducted by
way of New York and the Suez canal, but we shall
find a ready market for our surplus of iron and
steel manufactures in the development of railways
and general industry in China, and it will be found
not by way of Suez, but by our own vessels sailing
. out of our own ports on the Pacific."
The Journal of Commerce adds: "Yet to all this
the business men of the Pacific States seem to be
singularly obtuse. In his recent tour down the
i coast, in the course of which he addressed most of
I the commercial bodies, the Hon. John Barrett found
ready and appreciative listener?, but failed to evoke
the ( nthusiastic response which was readily forth
coming to his appeals in the East."
In hi to the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce Mr. Barrett told us of two things that
must be done to increase our oriental trade. First,
we must elect another United States Senator, and,
! second, we inu-i dig the .Nicaragua canal. He
this with the information that New York

the nearer seaport.
From New York to Calcutta by the Capo
of Good Hope the distance is 12,180 miles; to
Hon| tis ip.590 miles. By the Suez canal it
is 10,4 itta and 12, n0 to Hongkong.
From San Francisco to Hongkong it is 638] miles,
so that we now enjoy an advantage of 7209 miles
over New York by Good Hope to Hongkong and
by Suez. This advantage will be reduced by
more than 3000 miles by the construction of the
mal. It will put New York tha* much
nearer the Orient, but will leave San Francisco right
where she is. Now it may be obtuse in our mer
chants not to see how oriental trade is to be taken
from New York by decreasing her mileage to reach
'â¢ r - ! ' c Journal of Commerce can explain it,
but Mr. Barrett certainly did not.
There are reasons why California wants the canal,
but increase in her oriental trade is not among them.
We understand that the profit of commerce lies in
producing a greater surplus of what the Orient wants
taking mure of the surplus the Orient has to
spare. New York, in spite of greater distance, has
that trade now. We may get it by finding out what
the Orient takes from New York and producing it
here. Then we get the advantage of our shorter
â  transportation by sea.
But the origin of commerce being of the earth,
earthy, does not seem to concern experts like Mr.
ett.

UNIFORM DIVORCE LAWS.
rOR a long time past tiiere has been an agita
tion in this country directed against the evils
resulting from the laxity of the divorce laws in
several of the States and the conclusion which has
followed the contradictory decisions of the courts
on the effect of a divorce in one State upon the re
lations of the parties in another. The subject was
taken under consideration at the conference of
the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws last
August and a report has now been issued setting
forth the plan by which the Commissioners hope to
bring about uniformity in the statutes on the sub
ject.
The Commissioners recommend a law providing
that no divorce shall be granted in any State for a
cause arising out of the State which is not ground
for divorce in the State where it occurred; that
no person shall be entitled to divorce in any State
who has not had an actual residence in that State
for at least a year; that no person shall be entitled
to divorce unless the defendant shall have been per
sonally served with process if within the State or
with personal notice duly authenticated if out of the
State; that no divorce shall be granted except upon
trial before the court in open session; that after di
vorce either party may marry again; that divorces
shall he granted only for adultery, extreme cruelty,
habitual drunkenness or the confirmed habit of in
toxication arising from alcoholic drinks, or from
drugs, conviction of felony or continuous desertion
for a term of years.
It is stated in the report that the bill is the
carefully studied result of the three days' conference,
after going ovei the draft reported by the committee
on divorce. It goes over for final action another
year, as is usual with all the recommendations of the
conference, that it may be submitted to the Commis
sioners who were not present at the meeting. Of
course it is subject to change at the next conference
if found unadapted in expression to the jurisdictions
not represented at Buffalo. Otherwise it is put out
as a finished bill, embodying the decision of the con
ference on that branch of the subject.
It is the opinion of the Commissioners that the bill
presented by them is adapted to prevent to a large
extent the migratory divorces by which the laws of
one State are practically nullified by a temporary
residence in another State, to render less easy frauds
on courts and to give the respondent fuller opportun
ity for defense, and especially to make the final ef
fect of divorce the same all over the Union.
Every effort so far to bring about something of
order out of the confusion of the divorce laws of the
country has been so futile that the public will not
have much confidence in the success of the new ven
ture. The Commissioners, however, direct attention
to the fact that the uniform law on negotiable in
struments perfected by their conference in 1896 has
now been adopted by fifteen States and by Congress
for the District of Columbia. From that they draw
good auguries of the eventual success in the move
ment for uniform divorces. It is certain that a
strong backing will be given to their efforts, and
therefore the outlook for reform is by no means so
hopeless as it appears at first view.
From the very negative sort of young man he
seemed to be in San Francisco, Consul Wildman at
Hongkong appears to have become a bloodthirsty
personage. Letters from him just published by
Aguinaldo indicate that he advised the Filipino chief
tain to shed enough blood to force the Spaniards to
a taste of real war.
The announcement comes from Washington that
the retirement of General Shaffer has paved the way
for the promotion of five brigadier generals. In
spite of adverse criticism the commander of the De
partment of California seems to be a pretty big man.
REPLANTING BURNED FORESTS.
T \EPORTS from Pasadena concerning a move
k-/ ment there to undertake an extensive experi
ment in replanting forest land which has been
burned over are both interesting and encouraging.
By reason of the many fires which have occurred in
the woods of that section the people have been im
pressed with the need of forest protection and
preservation, and some of the more enterprising
among them, acting in concert with the officials of
the Government, have devised a plan of immediate
action from which much good may be expecte4
It appears that by reason of the fires the water
sheds in the vicinity of the city have been denuded,
and it is known that unless the trees can be made
to grow in the mountains the city's water supply
will go. Water has been very scarce all summer, so
scarce, indeed, that street sprinkling had to be
stopped for a time in half the city, and some of the
higher situated residents could not get water in their
bathtubs.
The plan proposed for remedying the evil is to
cut fire tracks through the woods along all the ridges
to the main ridge of the mountains. These tracks
are to be paths six feet wide and are to be kept clear
of brush, so that they will serve to check the spread
of fires. To render them more effective, and at the
same time to provide for a new' growth of timber,
the hickory pine, a native of San Bernardino, is to
be planted along the paths. The tree is said to be
virtually fireproof and does not burn even when at
tacked by a strong flame. It is, moreover, a valu
able tree for timber purposes, for it is not only a
rapid grower but in some instances has been known
to attain a height of ioo feet.
It is of course desired that the Government co
operate in the work, and efforts will be made to
obtain an appropriation for that purpose, but the
people of Pasadena do not intend to wait for action
on the part of the national authorities before begin
ning the work themselves. They know the value of
self help and intend to resort to it.
It is stated that ex-Mayor Lukens and Mr. \V. G.
Kerkoff have arranged to provide Forest Rangers
Newcomb and Hart -.veil with seed of the hickory
pine so that the plantations may be started as soon
as possible. The first area to be planted is that
which has been burned over, as the growth of the
hickory pine there it is believed will protect the for
ests now standing. The canyons will also be planted
with the trees, because it is in them the fires usually
start.
The experiment promise? to be of great value Â»o
the State in many ways. In. the first place it will
encourage other localities to rely upon their own
energies instead of waiting for the slow-moving Gov
ernment to act, and, in the second place, if the plan
tations of hickory pine do well and prove as effi
cacious as is expected, an important lesson will have
been taught in California forestry. To the people
of Pasadena, therefore, a great deal of credit, is due,
and throughout the State the results of their energy
and their experiment will be watched with more than
ordinary interest.
The papers that have been suppressing all reports
of the wonderful work clone by wireless telegraphy
will have a hard time explaining to their readers
why the Government thinks of adopting it in the
navy and why a movement has been started to make
use of it for communication among the islands of the
West Indies.
An Oakland physician has had several Filipinos
who were performing in this city arrested for rob
bing him. The little brown men had evidently come
to the conclusion, from the treatment they received
from Americans, that tit for tat is. a commendable
American privilege.
How to induce the Democrats to vote straight
while coaxing Republicans to vote crooked is the
problem that rattles Mayor Phelan and explains the
frequency with which he puts his foot in it when he
opens his mouth to talk politics.
The Oakland woman who, having been stabbed by
her husband, fired a load of buckshot into him,
now refuses to testify against her spouse. She evi
dently believes that she is quite as able as the law
to take care of herself.
If Sir Thomas Lipton stick to his expressed deter
mination to return to the contest for the America's
cup until he wins it he will probably spend a good
part of the remainder of his life with us.
As the Boers have no direct communication with
the outer world reports from the war in South Africa
will come almost wholly from British sources, but
the end will tell which sides win the battles.
The report that the Filipino chieftain, Pio del Pilar,
is tired of war should have been that he is tired of
the foot-racing required to keep out of reach of it
when the Americans are moving.

JNOU/5 I Jan francisco Call,
Very recently The San Francisco Call completed arrangements with the New York Herald
and the London Daily TelegTaph whereby the three papers should dispatch special war corre-
spondents to the field of operations between the British and the Boers in South Africa. The Daily
Telegraph, one of England's very greatest newspapers, commands an influential position for obtain-
ing inside information regarding movements of British troops and ships. Its record in gathering
war news in the Franco-Prussian war, in the Chino-Japanese war and in the Soudan campaigns,
was unsurpassed. The New York Herald's supremacy in obtaining foreign war news and transmit-
ting it to this country is clearly unassailable.
Through this powerful combination in the newspaper world The Call will continue to fur-
nish its readers with the earliest and most reliable information of the war in South Africa.

The Republicans are not making the |
mistake of underrating the strength of ;
the opposition. The tact is Â«ell under- j

talker. It is. known that he can go south |
of Market street and catch applause as i
v straight-out Democrat of tree-silver j
propensities and within the next hour ap- :
peal to voters in another quarter of the i
city for support on the ground of his |
non-partisan and sound-money senti
ments. The Mayor fooled the people
twice by such political tactics, but the ,
voters are now "on to his curves."
Before the present campaign opened ;
The Call secured Information that Phelan j
in the campaign last year addressed vot- |
ers In Democratic districts south of Mar
ket streets, telling them that he was a
iree-silver man, and the same evening an- j
nounced to an audience in a Republican j
district that he had always stood for
sound-money principles.
Early in the present campaign The Call j
deemed it wise to engage expert steno- :
graphers to take down, word for word, j
what the Mayor said to Democratic audl- |
ti-.eis to catch the Democratic vote. On
August 4, four days before the primary ;
election! there was a mass-meeting: at I
Metropolitan Hall, called by Gavin Mc-
Nab's Committee of one Hundred. Gavin
McNab was there in the flesh behind the
scenes. Jasper McDonald was there. The
candidates subsequently placed on the i
Phelan ticket were there, as they knew
at that time that they would get the coy- |
eted nominations if McXab gained control
of the convention.
Mayor Phelan addressed the meeting,
and in his speech declared that the Re
publican party was composed of men who
prey upon the public revenues and avoid
their share of taxation. He Droclaimed I
in favor of party lines in municipal af- !
fairs, uttering these words:
Now. that ballot law adopted by
the last Legislature magnifies enor
mously the importance of party con- j
ventions. We all have to be party I
men now. We have to carry out re- j
forms within the party. We all have i
to be party politicians; we can't be j
independents and go before the peo
pie and say we â¢will do thus and so.

CANDIDATE BLACK
UPHELD BY LABOR
The greater portion of last nlghfs ses
sion of the Labor Council was devoted to
a discussion on the standing of A. P.
Black, the Republican nominee for Dis
trict Attorney. The Musicians' Union,
through its delegate, A. Dijeau, labored
hard and assiduously to have the council
Itself on record as ordering a polit
ical boycott on A. P. Black's candidacy.
By way of fortifying his argument in
this respect the delegate stated that Mr.
I<lack favored the employment of non
union musicians in the Western Addition
Literary and Social organization of which
he (Black) was the. president, notwith
standing that he was at one time the
president of the Musicians' Union. To
straighten this charge out; and place the
matter fully and fairly before the council,
Mr. Black sent in a communication in
which appeared extracts from the min
utes of two of the meetings of the West
ern Addition Society, in which it was of
record that he was its president at the
time of the alleged employment of the
non-union musicians. The minutes showed
that he opposed the employment of the
Hynes band, which was charged with be
ing a "scab organization. These undis
. extracts were ignored by the musi
egates, who stil! insisted on hav
ing the council go on record as issuing
a political boycott.
The good Judgment of the majority of
the delegates prevailed, however, and the
"("â â¢st tint the Musicians' Union got was
on order that their protest be plac<
the minutes of the council as being the
voice of the Musicians' Union, which
body, It was stated., would not vote for
Black. The Labor Council declined I
a party to any such undertaking, leaving
its members and tho unions i â¢
by its delegates free to vote as they may
see tit.
TALKED TO THE ECHOES.
Democratic Orators Face the
Dreary Emptiness of
Saratoga Hall.
The elements combined last night to
make the mass meeting of the Thirty
ninth Assembly District anything but a
success. The place of meeting, Saratoga
Ha!i, was dreary in its emptiness, but 1L"
the crowd was small ft made up in en
thusiasm what it lacked In numbers. Dr.
R. Beverly Cole was the first speaker of
the evening. The venerable physician
begged his hearers to believe that he
- the office of Coroner to elevate it
to that dignity it deserves. A general
plea for the entire Democratic ticket.
the physicians address, and Judge
Mogan was introduced. The only signii
cant part of his speech was a plea that
voters cast their ballots for four Police
Judges. This remark was called forth by
an impassioned protest delivered by
George H. Cabaniss the night before. He
and his well-wishers havt- very good rea
son to believe that the friends of Judges
Mogan and Conlan intend to "plump" for
them and sacrifice Cabaniss and Fritz.
Cabanlss naturally does not like the ar
rangement and objects. Mogan attempt
ed last night to close the breach. When
it came the turn of (. abaniss to -
he said nice things of Mogan and noth
ing else in particular.
Osgood Putnam was again chosen to
represent the Supervisorial nominees. Mr.
Putnam ought to get a new speech. The
one he has used since the beginning of
the campaign is becoming tiresome, al
though it possesses the merit of being
offensive. In paying a tribute last night
to Joseph Tobin, one of the Supervisorial
nominees, Mr. Putnam said that Tobln Is
t the family that controls the Hiber
nia Bank, "that splendid Institution,"
Putnam, "which takes can of ;!.â¢
rr.oney of poor people so much better than
! r people can take care of it them
selves."
After Putnam had concluded Patrick
Boland was given an opportunity to tell
what he will do if elected Public Admin
istrator. Franklin K. Lane sang the old

MAIL STEAMSHIP
MOANA ARRIVES
FROM AUSTRALIA
Beats Hongkong Maru
From Honolulu.
THE PHILIPPINE A BEAUTY
SHE WILL MAKE HER MAIDEN
VOYAGE TO MANILA.
The Lottie Bennett Launched at Port
Blakeley Last Wednesday â Lil
liebonne Coining Here for
Repairs â Notes.
The mall steamer Moana arrived from
Sydney. N. S. W.. via Auckland, New Zea
land, Apia, Samoa, and Honolulu, Ha
j waiian Islands, yesterday. She was off the
Farallones Thursday night, but owing to
the thick, dirty weather Captain Carey
did not attempt to make port. When the
fog lifted a little yesterday morning the
vessel was put on her course ajid came
along under a slow bell.
The Hongkong Maru from China and I
Japan reached Honolulu while the Moana
was there, a day ahead of time. She was i
I to have sailed for San Francisco ten hours \
\ after the Moana and there was a lot of j
| betting- that the Maru would make up the |
lost time and beat the Moana into port, j
Some of the Moana's passengers Joined In â¢
the belief that the Hongkong Maru would
reach port first, and one of them. Dr. Har- '
I tog, changed over to the China steamer '
| because ot his belief. He backed up his !
assertion with a wager of a basket of j
champagne and will have the pleasure of '
; .tying it as soon as the Hongkong Maru
gets alongside the wharf.
The Hongkong Maru and Moana will
have a chance to measure speed on their
next voyage, as they both leave for Hono
lulu the same day.
The last time the Moana left here for
the colonies the Gaelic sailed for the Ori
j ent. Both vessels were in splendid trim
and an exciting race was expected. The
Gaelic got away thirteen hours in the lead j
owing to the Moana being delayed waiting 1
for the English mails. Once started, how- i
ever, the Moana wasted no time and the
result was that she reached Honolulu two â 
hours and a half ahead of the Gaelic, thus
beating her fifteen and a half hours.
The Moana brought 60 cabin and 120
Bteerage passengers. She also broght up t
$1,132,750 in treasure coiurgned to the Bank i
of British North Annrica and the London, j
Paris and American Hank. The overdue ;
American ship Charles E. Moody had not !
arrived at Honolulu when the Moana left
there. She Is now oui 185 (lays, and 50 pi r

and Â«'iirÃo.
While the Moana was In Sydney the
: States Government made an effort
her for a transport. A large sum
was offered for the use of the steamer.
but the owners would not agree to the
price, to the deal fell through. The big
mail steamer would have made a model

DEMOCRATIC BANNER.
Dr. Cleveland, People's Party
Candidate for Mayor,
Will Uphold It.
Dr. Charles D. Cleveland, the People's
party nominee for Mayor, is in the fight
and in it to stay, so he declares.
"I intend to make an open fight for the
Mayoralty," raid the doctor, "and I feel
pleased with the assurance given me by
my friends and friends of the party.
"The platform of the People 1 * 'party
Is but a continuation of the principles of
Jefferson, that the welfare and freedom
of the people must be protected at all
hazards.
"I am a Democratâ not a municipal
Democrat alone, but a Democrat with
Democratic principles on State and na
tional issues, too. We have in our hearts
a warm feeling for James G. Maguire.
"We sustained him in Sacramento because
he does not confine his Democratic prin
ciples solely to municipal politics.
"With the power vested '.n the Mayor
under the new charter a nominee should
not only be educated and experienced but
should also be a publicist; should bear his
r thoroughly inscribed that ail his
fellow-citizens may be able to cry aloud'
'There Is my banner." To label oneself"
a Democrat without proclaiming the doc
trine and principle or his creed Is empty
meaningless, weak and Idiotic.
"Our politics must be composed of an
entity and not made up of scraps and
threads disjointed by the space of time
that divides municipal and State and na
tional elections."
A ratiilcation meeting of the People's
pnrty will be held at a date to be an
nounced hereafter.
SINGER ELLIOTT

Journeyed Many Miles
But in Vain,
MANAGER REPORTED HIM ILL
THEN HE TURNED UP TO SAY
HE WAS WELL.
Local Comedy of Errors in Which
Several Well Known Local En
tertainers Unwillingly Fig
ured Monday Night.
Two towns are laughing over the mis- j
hap that befell the Knickerbocker Quar- j
tet and their company on Monday night !
last. They were to give a performance
at Petaluma, but failed to connect, and !
the story of that failure is the cause of :
the merriment mentioned before. The :
Knickerbockers are the following: Her
bert Williams, William Elliott, Douglass
Crane and L. A. Larsen. Tljey were to be
assisted at Petaluma by C. B. Newton,
elocutionist ; J. Warren .Lucy, pianist;
and Miss Shipley, cornetlst. The arrange
ment was that all the company were to
take the 5 p. m. Tiburon boat. When the
boat started a round-up was made by the
manager of the aggregation. To his grief
and to the consternation of all, Elliott
was missing. He was not on the boat.
Here was a "pretty how de do!" Once
another member of the companyâ one of
the quartetâ had failed to connect when
a concert was to be given In Nevada
County. The unsympathetic mountain
eers, when three singers only filed on the
stage to represent tne Quartet, gave the
heroic trio lirst the glassy eye, then, be
coming heated, they hissed the dlscom
llted singers from the stage. An ironclad
agreement was then entered into between
the singers and the manager by which
the manager was given powers that
transcend those popularly supposed to be
vested in the Czar of all the Kusslas.
The passengers on the Tiburon boat were
hurrilied at some expressions that they
heard concerning the missing Elliott.
There were threats that would have
blanched the hair of the missing vocalist
like to driven snow. There were words
of despair and woe to move the Sphinx
to tears. _
"It is no use to go on to Petaluma.
This was the general conclusion of the
company before the boat had touched the
nortii short- of the buy. There was noth
ing left to do but telegraph to the people
at Petaluma that the entertainment was
off, and this was left to the ingenuity of
the manager to do properly. He was equal
to the occasion. The singers and their
allies went on the cars to San Rafai-1.
There they debarked and prepared to re
turn to this city, sad and depressed with
a sense of defeat. This was the message
that soon greeted the eyes of the manager
of the hall in Petaluma where the enter
tainment was to have been given:
"Elliott is sick. For that reason enter
tainment must be postponed."
When the party reached this city on
their return one of the Knickerbockers
volunteered to inquire, into the mysterious
tailure of Elite tt to connect. He went to
Oakland and ihere saw Mrs. Elliott. Thci
ludy was surprised to hear that Elliott
had not gone to Petaluma. She had no
knowledge of his whereabouts, and she
was alarmed when she found out that he
was missing.
In the meantime a gentleman carrying a
uress-sult case and wearing a look of ex
treme anxiety was riding from San Ra
fael at the top speed of a span of well
kept horses in thyÂ» direction of Petaluma.
He reached that charming place 'ii due
tme, not long before the hour set for the
entertainment to begin. Ho put on a
drews suit hurriedly and sauntered around
to the hall. To his surprise there were no
lights in the hall. He hunted up the man
ager and asked some questions.
"it's no use, young man," answered that
Individual. "There will be no concert for
you to attend here to-night, and you may
just as well go home. I had a dispatch
from the manager of the Knickerbockers
from San Rafael saying that they could
not come because Elliott was sick."
"Great Scott, man! What are you talk
ing about? Why, I am Elliott."
The manager whistled. The vocalist
saw it all then, and grinned and prepared
to make the best of tne night in Petaluma.
His late trip across the bay and his hard
drive to Petaluma had been of no avail.
He had carriage hire to pay. and had lost
his expected returns from the entertain
ment that did not come off. Since then
the matter has all been patched up. An
other date has been fixed, and Petalumans
will find their tickets are still good.

of storm lastâ according to official fore
castâand then It will be drunk dry by the
thirsty earth hereabouts. ,j
The storm, the rain part of which fell
upon this city yesterday afternoon and
last night, has covered the entire coast
north of San Francisco, leaving its
watery wake in the Sacramento galley
particulars. At Red Bluff a full inch
was recorded yesterday afternoon, with
more scheduled to fall to-day. In this
city we are ahead of last year's record,
which Is 1.75 inches. This was topped this
season at an early hour last night.
Some weather prophet of amateur
standing lost himpclf in the rain last night
and he went about trying to place money
that this would be the wettest year of
California's existence. The season of
1889-90 brought 52.27 inches to the State,
but he showed no respect for figures and
his wager is still open. If his forecast Is
true a banner wet season will replace that
of ISS9-90 on the books.

"Yes, he Is the man, sergeant," shouted
an excited woman in the City Prison last
night when a young carpenter, named F.
Tj. Day, was brought before her to be
identified as the person who assaulted
her young daughter at the corner of De

over a year ago.
"And let me warn you, you miserable

tones, "that if you get out of this trouble
and I ever see you around my house I'll

It was only an hour before that Day,
who resides at the corner of Golden Gate
avenue and Devisadero street, was arrest

nine-year-old daughter of David Davis,
who resides at DIG Devisadero street. At
an opportune moment the little girl's

Day a sound drubbing and then turned
him over to Policeman Max Fenner, who

Fenner took his prisoner to the O'Farrell

An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Syri*i of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fis Sybup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxattve and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
| dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
I gently yet promptly and enabling one
; to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna F.nd
Other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Strip
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company

GRIDIRON GAME IS
THE TALK OF ALL
THE COLLEGE MEN
Stanford's Athli 111 line
Vgainst Olympic Brawn
This Afternoon.
Already the college men nre beginning |
to count the number of wpeks before the j
Thanksgiving game and consume hours In I
Idle talk upon future possibilities. Thi j
football season is under full sailing, and |
every effort and every experiment on the j
part of the coaches at both universities
will tell upon ihe teams which they are j
organizing.
Stanford men nre working with a will, j
full of the realization of the thorny path i
wliich is to be their going before the big j
game which ends this season. The mate- !
rial at Palo Alto is not all of the best, but J
such as it is it wiil give an account of it
seif on Thanksgiving day. Slowly but >
surely Chamberlin and his assistants are |
developing a teaml In another week the i
nucleus of the line will be segregated and j
t)ien will begin the efforts ot' coach and j
captain to organize the eleven that will
represent the cardinal in the annual grid
iron contest.
Fallen from their high estate is the
much-trumpeted Olympic eleven. When j
thy- season opened no team in the iield i
had brighter prospects for a series if un- 1
broken victories. Some there were who j
deliberately made bets of substantial i
bums that the Olympics would not loso a j
single game. As yet the clubmen have !
net won a game, though out of three I
played they lost but a. single contest, the
other two being ties.
The reason lor the Olympics' lack of
success is easy to fathom. They do not
train properly and have not the necessary j
practice. With a list of men that ought !
to carry everything before it nothing out 1
a negative result has been accomplished.
This week's method of practice is a full |
exemplification ot" the reason .of the club
men's non-success. The full team was i
not out a single night, and several times
practice had to be foregon..- because the
mtn could not attend. The difficulty is
not so much in a lack of spirit, but the in
ability of the players to appear in time I
for practice. The majority cf the men j
playing with the winged "O" are engaged
in business pursuits and cannot saeruice
their callings for the sport of the gridiron
Thus it happens that when the Olympic
team lines up for the Saturday panics
there, is a doubtful uncertainty as to the
performance of the clubmen.
The game to-day between Stanford and :
the Olympics will show many changes in
the line-up of the latter team. Thierkauf
a home product and a good football
player either at end or. back of the line
is ill with typhoid fever. This is a great
loss to the Olympic eleven and will crip
ple the backs in no mean measure Not
only will the Olympics suffer from the
absence of Thierkauf. Feltoh Taylor,
whose smashing plunges through " the
California line last Saturday netted many
yards for the Olympics, will not play to
day. This ;s another weakening with
drawal and will give the new Olympic
backs some fierce labor in making up thÂ»
absence or* Thierkauf and Taylor The
day of Hpbbs on the Olympic' team has
passed. Business is his excuse fur not
being able to participate either In the ;
practice games or in the match Satur
day afternoon. In his place will be the
redoubtable Charles Fickert, at one time
captain of the Stanford team. Flckert
is a guard of excellent reputation, de
pending upon the demonstration of gen
uine ability on the gridiron field. What i
he lacks, however. Is training. HI con
dition is not up to the standard; â  111 he i
may be counted upon to play good foot-
Tno gamp last Saturday afternoon ex
posed tho possibility of weakness in Cali
fornia's team and what concentration of
effort might do for the Olympics. In the
second half California was within scor
ing distance a couple of times, but the
spirit- was. lacking and the execution of
the plays poor, Cochran was not a
happy man aftÂ«'i; the game and what he
said were not words that denoted a pious
and a humble spirit. With the univer
sity eleven; the best the college can so
far show, the playing was of a quality
that hardly surpassed the Olympics. For
a short, time it. looked as if the Olym
pics might work out a touchdown; (but
thÂ«-y, too, lost heart and nothing hap
pened:
In consequence of the game last Satur
day Coaches Cochran and Kelly have
been forcing the play on the California
campus. Iho team has been laboring un
der the misapprehension that a "cinch"
awaits them on November 20. The indi
vidual players thought that the am Is
already picked not to bo changed. There,
wiil be a race mnnng the second eleven
men for positions and both coaches are
ready to give any candidate the chance
to play on the team when his work sur
passes that of his competitor. Th^ spirit
at Stanford Is similar to what it was
at California last yparâ deslm for hard
earnest nd enthusiastic work toward a
well defined end.
The freshman game thr^o weeks from
to-day will draw the attention of the col
lege men and particularly the enthusi
asts who have Just matriculated The
new material at California has not bf-en
fit her prolific of quantity or superabund
antly excellent of quality. Unremlttent
have been the complaints of coaches upon
the lack of big men in the freshman class
at the university. At Stanford every
thing points to a strong eleven So far
nothing but victories mark the course of
the Stanford freshmen outside of the sin
gle feat which was meted out by the
sophomores in an Interclass contest I
There is nothing quite as uncertain as a
freshman football game, however, and
this year's contest may result in a gpod
gridiron struggle.
The game between the Olympic and
Stanford this afternoon at the Sixteenth
and Folsom street grounds will begin at
3 o'clock. â¢ .
STANFORD MEN IMPROVE.
STAFFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 20.â
Under the direction of over a half-dozen
coaches and trainers Stanford's football
mm continuo to improve. The men are
fast rounding Into condition, and during
the past week have put up the best prac
tice games that have been seen on the ;
campus for two years. Virtually every \
position on the team is open, and the -
competition for places is growing sharper
day by day. Especially is this true of:
the tackle and miard positions, where i
thÂ«Â»re are a score of likely candidates.
Burnett and De Forest have done much
to strengthen the line, and with Oilman
at center should form a center trio which
will compare favorably with that which i
made the 1887 team invincible. Among the
tackles there is probably the best material j
that ever tried for a Stanford team,
though they must be developed. Dole,
Huston, Bentley, Wrigley, Faris, Emer
son and Bidwell are all men of weight and j
experience. Under a coach who Is nlmself
Camp's first choice for tackle on All- !
America's team, there should, be developed]

After the arrival of the 6:20 p. m. boat
from the city a Corinthian supper will be j

now drawing to a close has been full of
pleasure and honor to the Corinthians,
"even though, in response to a pressing

Next Saturday the Californias will close
the season at the club house on Oakland i

squadron cruise.
An appropriation of $48,000 hag been
made by Congress for the dredging and
Improvement of Alviso Slough, and a com
mittee of San Jose and Santa Clara Coun
ty business men has been appointed to see i
that the money is expended to the best ad- :
vantage. When the work under the con- |
tract is finished there will be seven feet of ;
water in the slough at the lowest tide. As i
the contract calls for an outlay of only
$12,600. there will still be left about $35,000,
the expenditure of which would render the
harbor capable of accommodating the
largest coastwise vessels.
The annual championship race of the
Tacoma Yacht Club took place September

two yachts crossed the starting line, Cap

dore Caldwell's Storm King. The former
started at 2:30:31, and the latter 2 seconds
later. The Storm King rounded Vashon
Island stakeboat some minutes ahead or
the Windward and at Dash Point had a
half-mile lead. .Then the Storm King ran
close in to shore and lost the wind, while
the Windward out in the channel bowled'
along under a stiff breeze and finished 18
minutes ahead of her rival. A week pre

OARSMEN PUT AWAY
THEIR RACE BOATS
FOR THE SEASON
Skiff, Shell and Barge Cham
pionships Divided 'A mono;
Five Cluhs.
I >!gh tlio number of spectators was
irafringly small last Sunday at El
po the day was fine and the wiitT
unusually smooth. The conditions wore
eminently favorable for boat racing. The
programme dragged a little, but as all
the events were contested before dark
and In good time for the last trip of tne
ferry-boat Link to the city there Is no
reason for complaint on that score.
Though there were some surprises arid
disappointments the racing passed off
without hitch and with oniy one mishap,
and that was not a serious one. The
clubs divided the honors between them,
ii.l except the Pioneers winning an event.
As George McGrill's shell, owing to an
accident, was leaky and filled with wa
ter In rowing down to the rtarting line,
only two competitorsâ E. Ster.berg of the
Artels and George Lewis of the Alamedas
âwere left in the junior Bhell race. The
former won easily. The Ariels, with E.
Lynch as stroke, also wen the junior
barge n (n the senior skiff race a.
W. Pape of the Dolphins beat l>r. O. C.
Dennis of the South Ends and George Ba
ker of the Dolphins. The senior shell
race was won by James P. Foley of the
South Ends, who defeated 11. A. Wltt
kopf, the Ariel sculler, easily. In the
junior skiff race Stanley Addefley of the
Triton Boating Club won as he liked from
three competitors. This Is the first cham
pionship won by the Tritons for many
years. The Alamedas had a hard race to
retain the senior championship, the Pio
neer crew pressing them closely. Thus
the Ariel Rowing Club won two cham
pionships, the Alamedas. South Ends,
Dolphins and Tritons one each. The
Smith End barge crews proved decidedly
disappointing to their admirers, .ââ¢? .Here
whs a strong impression that the Juniors
with Dr. C. C. Dennis at bow and Barnes
P. Foley at stroke, were fast Foley.
: however, set a slow stroke, though a long
and even one, while the Alameda crew
rowed a fast and short stroke. The South
Ends, who had the inside station, got Into
shallow water at the turn and abrjidoned
the race, leaving the Ariels to win by
! two lengths from the Alameda juniors.
The senior barge race was a pretty one,
all the crews rowing a good stro, g- stroke,
the Alamedas being, as usual, -ather
phort and inclined not to pull the oar -well
through. The course, however, was only
about one mile and a furlong, and a very
j rapid bucketing stroke may be kept up
f â  >r that distance by men In good condi
tion.
Trophies of the Chase Secured by California Sportsmen.
The splendid specimen of a deer's head, with its wide-spreading horns,
shown in the illustration bears mute testimony to the ability of E. W. Hughes
of Montague. Mr. Hughes killed the deer Borne days since on Ball Mountain,
Siskiyou County. The group of sportsmen, who seem so well satisfied with the
result of their first day's shooting, la made up of A. C. Hoe ami party of Eureka.
Their vacation was spent at the head of Redwood Creek, in the Eel' River coun
try, some thirty miles from Eureka. The. camera tells how successful they were.
SERIES OF GAMES
BY LEAGUE TEAMS
ON LOCAL GROUNDS
A contest en the local diamond between
Sacramento and Santa Cruz has never yet
been witnessed. In response to popular
demand arrangements have been made for
a game between these teams at Recrea
tion Park to-morrow forenoon, commenc
ing at 10:30 o'clock. There will be games
morning and afternoon on both sides of
the bai'. Spectators at each park will be
kept informed of the progress of the con
tests. There will be a series of three
games between Oakland and San Fran
cisco, and there will be two contests be
tween Santa Cruz and Sacramento. At
the close of these series there may- bo a
decided change in the standing of the
teams. The Oaklands are no* satisfied
with getting away from the tail end, but
are ambitious for championship honors,
although there is not much likelihood of
their getting into the race for first place.

DUCKS COME IN
WITH THE STORM
FROM THE NORTH
Gunmen Anticipate Good Sport
on the Marshes From This
Time Forth.
Ducks are commencing 1 to arrive from
the north in numbers, and all the signs
indicate that sport will soon be in full
swing in the marshes. Market hunters
who make the habits of the birds a life
Btudy aflirm that their arrival from their
northern haunts occurs annually about
the 20th of this month. During the past
week members of the Spooney Gun Club
have seen many birds flying aimlessly
about Alvarado, as though they were get
ting acquainted with their surroundings.
The weather conditions are favorable for
brinKing the birds from the north in
large numbers. As a senuence,. the men
who shoot over preserves anticipate the
best of sport from this time forth.
Five members of the Olympic (iun Club
shot over its preserves at Cordelia last
Sunday. 11. E3. Rose was high gun, with
seventeen; F. B. Surryhne secured six
teen, W. D. McArthur ten, George Walker
six and J. C. Jensen seven. On Wednes
day E. W. Briggs bagged fifteen, H. B.
Hosmer and Al Cummins ten each.
Among the men who will be out to-mor
row are: 11. E. Rose, \V. D, McCarthy,
W. A. Marshall, George Walker and W.
A. Goosen.
Herman Severn has succeeded E. C.
Lloyd as gamekeeper at the club pre
serve. The members of Green Valley Gun
Club, Cordelia, took summary action re
cently In the case of one of their mem
bers caught poaching on the Olympic pre
serve. They expelled him from the club.
His act was aggravated, as it was com
mitted before tne season opened.
The annual meeting of the Olympics
will he held next Wednesday. A nomi
nating committee of five members will be
appointed. This committee must name
the regular ticket within live days after
its appointment. The club has prospered
during the past year, making decided
gains in membership.
Len D. Owens returned during the week
from a visit to New York. While there
he saw the Dewey demonstration, but
grÂ»w tired waiting for the yacht race.
Lloyd Baton ana "Charley" Dietz had
some good rail-shooting on the bay shore
near San Mateo last Sunday. They were
not alone, many of the gunmen going
down for the day on the marsh.
The members of the Spooney Gun Clubâ
L. R. Larzalere, John Eurfeind, Phil Bek
eart and J. K. Milesâ were on their pre
serve near Alvarado last Sunday. The
birds were more numerous than at any
other time this year, but they flew un
usually high. They all seemed new to
their surroundings and were apparently
getting acquainted with the feeding
ground. &
Mr. Johnson of the Black Jack Club was
a~ain high gun last Sunday at the club's
preserve.
Of the Pastime Gun Club members Carl
son secured nine, Dennison seven and
Ostranger six. The total bag of all the

OLYMPIC OUTING IS OFF.
Owing to the Inclement weather the
[Olympic Club officials have postponed for
one week the outing proposed for all the
members, which was to have been held
at Escalles to-morrow. George James,
who is in charge of the arrangements,
states that the ground would be too wet
for outdoor games and it was thought
best to postpone it accordingly. When
Mr. James' attention was called- to the
fact that the Associated Cycling Clubs
had its annual 10-mile road race set (or
the 29th inst., the day to which the Olym
pic outing has been postponed, he stated
that that made no difference to the Olym

"INDIGENTS" CAUSE TROUBLE
Â«,
CONTRACTOR VEBKONTEREN IN
A BAD SITUATION.
I
A Very Awkward Predicament Fol- ,
lows a Protest by the Creditors
of the F. E. Luty Es
tate. .
A. Verkonteren, who ha.-? the contract
to bury the city's indigent dead, is sorely
puzzled over v. difficulty he has collided |
with. Some time ago the Supervisors ;
passed a law prohibiting the further in- I
ternient of the d*-ad within the city lim
its, and before arrangements were made j
for the interment of indigents elsewhere ;
Mr. Verkonujren had accumulated about
two dozen bodies which he did not know
what to do with. While in this predica
ment he noticed an advertisement of the
sale of some lots in the Abbey Homestead j
Addition, lying on the boundary of San i
Francisco ana ban Mateo counties. He j
bid tor two lots the sum oÂ£ Â»TjO, which ,
was accepted by the executrix. Without J
los., of time Mr. Verkonteren placed the i
bodies under the sod of hid recent pur- j
chase: starting ;i cemetery of his own.
he was getting ready to make additions i
to his graveyard when the matter or con- j
lirmirig the -sale of the lands, which were }
a part of the estate of F. E. Luty, came
up before Probate Judge Coffey. lhen
there was a hitch which had not been an
ticipated: Some of the creditors roi the
estate entered a protest against the sale
of the land; and In spite ot the fact that
the purchaser had marie a liberal deposit
the sale was not confirmed by the court, j
What made matters worse I was the met ,
that the court ordered the land roudvor
tiscl tor sale. This is what has tied
thing's up in a hard knot. Mr. Verkon
toren does not know whether he has the
two dozen bodies on his hands now or not.
if lie has it is a question as to whether
i r not he can disintt-r the bodies, for the
law is very strict in the matter of dis
turbing the dead. Should some one o!se
buy the. property it is very likely that tho
now purchaser will demand that the
"owner" of the bodies remove the same
without regard to whether he can do so
There is still another question that the I
unfortunate gentleman is studying over,
and that is if he can remove the bodies
without bting molested for trespassing
what can he do with them so that he will j
not suffer great loss in again disposing
i f them. At present indications Mr. Ver- I
komeren will be a lively bidder for the j
â¢lots when they are again on tho marktt. j
In the event of his being successful he j
hopes to induce the authorities of San j
Mateo and Pan Francisco counties to a!- ]
low him to let the Indigents remain where
they are. which may be difficult; for so
far' the lots in question are not included .
in the lands set apart for cemetery pur
poses. j

By Wednesday next. if nothing hap
pens, the last of the first ten regiments
i called for by the Government under the
. army extension bill will be on their way
; to the Philippine Islands, and by the time
they start thn regiments of the second call
that will cross the ocean from here will
! have commenced to arrive. It has been
i so from the time the first of the United
States volunteers came here. One regi
ment has followed the other so closely
that at times there has been no time to
spare between th^m, yet not one has
crowded so fast upon the heels of the one
before it as to cause trouble. There has
always been one regiment able to get out
of the way and make place for the new
comer, and it looks as if the same sys
tem will prevail lv the regiments now
heading westward.
Of the second ten, seven will leave for
the islands from this coast, six from here
and one from Portland, and three will
1 leave from the East. The Forty-first, re
'â â  cruiting at Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont,
and the Forty-third and Forty-seventh
regiments, recruiting at Camp Meade,
Pennsylvania, will be the ones to go by
way of the Suez canal. Ihey will be
taken on the transports Thomas, Logan
: and Meade, and when these vessels have
j landed their troops safely in Manila they
: will join the fleet of transports plying be
tween here and there. The Thirty-ninth,
recruiting at Fort Crook, Nebraska, Will

A SOLDIERS' LIBRARY.
Organization Formed to Supply
Books to the Troops in the
Philippines.
The committee that will have charge of
the establishing and maintaining of the
free circulating library In the Philippines
was organized on Thursday evening at a
meeting held in the rooms of Colonel and
Mrs. Charles R. Greenleaf at the Hotel
Pleasanton. Officers were elected as fol
lows: Rabbi Jacob Vooreanger, president;
Wlllard B. Harrington, Urst vice presi
dent; Miss Anna Beaver, second vice
president; \V. S. McClure, secretary; P
N. Lllienthal. treasurer; Judge Ralph C

the officers.
The following were appointed to act on
the committee in conjunction with the
officers:: Mrs. Fhebe Hearst Mrs. Jane
Stanford, Dr. Daviu Starr Jordan, Presi

George A. Newhall Mrs. E. W McKin
rE" 1 ffihfe O Vy^ an ; John P - MÂ«?rlS
Mm' m Mack Â«?nzie and Mrs. W. 11.
The committee outlined the plan of
work and appointed committees for spe
cial lines. General Shafter offered to &e
--cure a receiving place for donated books,
and said he would communicate with
Rabbi Vooraanger on Saturday as to the
success of his endeavors. General Shafter
explained Colonel Mlley's plans as out
lined to him by the colonel in New York,
rhe colonel thought sufficient money
to carry the library along for two
years would be necessary, after which
time the Government would make pro
vision ,to sustain it, as had been done
formerly. General Shafter believed the
Government allowed $22 a month for each
company and ?11 a month for the band
He pledged his assistance in securing free
transportation for the books and also
means to have them properly packed and
Shipped. A committee will endeavor to
arrange for the transportation of the
books from different parts of the coun
try. Jney will consult with Wells, Fargo
& Co. and the different railroads
Mrs. Merrill, for the Red Cross, was ap
pointed receiving and distributing agent
for the committee. Mrs. I. LcnvenEerg
accepted the position of chairman of the
library committee, and will appoint as
sistants..
Mayor Phelan put before the committee
the last letter received by him from the
late Colonel John D. Mlley, to whom
much honor is due as the originator of
the scheme for supplying the soldiers
with proper literature to while away the
dreary hours spent under a foreign' sky
As . far as possible the original Plans of
Colonel Miley will be carried out to the
letter, with new ideas as they occur to the
committee.
Although the plans have but lately
taken definite shape, subscriptions are be
ing received by the committee, Up to date
the following moneys have been contrib
uted: The Berkeley Red Cross, of which
Mrs Greenleaf was the organiser, sub
scribed $350; the State Red Cross. $250;
Mayor Phelan, $50. and Mrs J. Greenl*af
130. The committee expects the fund to
swell rapidly now that the organization
has been effected. Those wishing to add
to it can call on the treasurer. P. N
Lllienthal.
Colonel and Mr?. Oreenleaf will leave
for Manila at the end of October, and the
committee will await suggestions from
them. In the meantime the work of col
lecting bonks and money will go on
On behalf of the soldiers stationed for
an indefinite period in a foreign landâ our
boys in the Philippinesâ an urgent appeal
Is made to all people of the United States
to all Americans, to help In whatever way
possible to Insure the permanent estab
lishment of the free library In the Philip
pines. Those who cannot subscribe mon"y
may give hooks, properly bound that can
be bandied and distributed in a circu
lating library. The army comprises men
who have left vocations and positions of
every sort to serve under the Stars and
Stripes, so books on all subjects will be
acceptable.
A house will be hired or bought In
Manila to be used as a library building
and reading-room, where every comfort
possible will be afforded the soldiers
Branches will be established In the other
towns where soldiers are stationed so
that all may have the benefit of the gift
of the American people.
Information will be supplied to the pub
lic through The Call as soon as a receiv
ing station for books has been secured
The- hearty co-operation of the public Is
desired.

Read the outspoken and fearless words of
Key. B. Mills, D.D. a prominent Presby-
terian minister, who recommended
Duffy's Pur Â© Malt Whiskey
in an article which appeared in the N.Y. Sun:
- . ..... Sleadc Center, Kans. :
Ay Dear Bro. : lour favor with the enclosed
slip is at hand. The facts are these : My wife was
an invalid for several years, and, on our physi-
cian's recommendation, used a certain preparation
with very great benefit. I received a letter in-
quiring as to its effects, to which I replied as
follows: "I am a Presbyterian clergyman, a
Doctor of Divinity, not of Medicine, but lam not
afraid to say that Duffy's Formula and Duffy's
Pure Malt \\ hiskcy are the purest and most effect-
ive preparations as medicines 1 know of, and my
experience is a large one." 1 am a temperance
nan, and never used, and would never ad vise any
man or woman to use. any intoxicant a* a bever-
age. My recommendation of Duffy's Formula
and Whiskey was made after a thorough knowl-
edge of their great value as medicines. The
statement was made deliberately and based upon-
facts, and I do not hesitate to stand by it. \ The
many temperance men who have written me on
this subject do not seem to realize that I was a
temperance man before many of them were born.

A HIGH COURT
Refuses to Obey Judge
De Haven.
MUST APPEAR FOR CONTEMPT
HIS TRIP TO MANILA MAY BE
DELAYED.
Court Remarked That It Was Un
heard of for a United States
Officer to Disregard a
Federal Judge.
Colonel Robert W. Leonard of the
Twenty-eighth Infantry, United States
Volunteers, is in trouble. He is up against
a Judge of thÂ« United States District
Court, and has been cited to appear be
fore United States District Judge de Ha
ven at 9 o'clock this morning to show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt for refusing to obey an order
of court.
On Thursday of this week Judge de Ha
ven issued a writ commanding the colonel
to produce in court at 11 o'clock yester
day morning the body of Charles Hook, a
member of Company X of the colonel's
regiment. The boy's mother, .Emilia
Hook, had obtained a writ of habeas
corpus on her alleging that Charles was
not more than 17 yearss old and that he
was her sole support. Deputy United
States Marshal Burnhum served the writ
on the colonel at the Presidio.
"The boy is here," said Colonel Leon
ard, "and he is upstairs, if you want
him you may go and get him."
"I have no authority to bring the boy,"
replied Mr. Burnham. "This writ directs
you, the colonel commanding the regi
ment, to produce the boy in court."
"1 won t bring him." said the colonel,
with the air of General Grant when he
declared that he proposed to tight on a
certain line even if it occupied the entire
summer.
When 11 o'clock came yesterday neither
the colonel nor the boy appeared in court.
An adjournment was thereupon ordered
until 2 p. m., no one In the courtroom be
lieving for an instant that the colonel
would dare remain away and defy the
power of the Federal court.
When the hour of 2 p. m. arrived every
body connected with the case was present
in court except the boy and the colonel.
Deputy Marshal Burnham was placed un
der oath and recited into the amazed and
indignant ears of justice all the details
of his meeting with the dauntless colonel
and the conversation that had taken place
on that occasion.
On the wall to the left of the judicial
seat Is hung a portrait in oil of the late
Judge Hoffman. The face of the portrait
seemed to wear an unusually stern ex
pression as the eyes of Judge de Haven
rested upon it. In a moment afterward
Judge de Haven leaned forward in his
chair and addressing: United States At
torney Coombs remarked in that slow,
deliberate and calm judicial way which is
characteristic of the Judge of the District
Court that it was an unheard of proceed
ing for a United States officer to refuse
to obey a summons from the United
States District Court.
The court then ordered a writ issued
commanding Colonel Leonard to appear
this morning at 9 o'clock and show causa
why even he should not be punished for
contempt.
About an hour after the adjournment
the boy was brought to the office of
United States Marshal Shine by a ser
geant of Company F. but the Marshal
could not receive him. He must be sur
rendered by the colonel in person.
The Twenty-eighth Regiment is booked
to sail for Manila on Monday on one of
the six transports" which will leave on
that date for the Philippines. An apology
more or less abject from the military
point of view must be made to the court
If the. colonel* wishes to Â«all with his com
mand to slaughter the Tagallos.
Dewey Celebration Plans.
A meeting of the Dewey celebration
committee was held last evening, Captain
E. A. I/orenzo presiding. The rain kept
most rif the chairmen of sub-committees
away and not much progress was made
In the absence of reports. The finance
committee reported that business men had
been approached and were willing- to con
tribute fund*, but no deiinite amounts had
been mentioned yet. The parade commit
tee reported that about fifty organizations
had expressed a desire to take part in the
parade. Among the organizations that
will parade are Golden Gate and Califor
nia Comir.anderies. K. T. The Invitation
committee reported that 20/hX) Invitations
to the exercises in the Pavilion will be
ready at the next meeting. The chairman
was authorized to telegraph to Admiral
1 lewey and invite him to attend the cele
bration, or. If that is not feasible, to name
some one to represent him. Secretary Mc-
Xaughton suggested and the suggestion
was adopted that the next meeting of the
committee should be held in room 27,
Flood building, ne-xt Wednesday evening.
The subject of the Dewey float for the
procession wan Informally discussed and
the chairman was Instructed to have the
plans ready to report as soon as possible.

RECEIVERS NOT NECESSARY.
Supreme Court on Building and Loan
Association Law.
Some time ago the Attorney General,
upon the complaint of the State Commis
sioners of the Building and Loan Associa
tions, began actions against the Union
Building and Loan Association of Sacra
mento and its directors. The Commission
ers concluded after examination that the
corporation was conducting its business
in an unsafe manner, such as to make its
further proceeding hazardous to the pub
lic and to those having funds In its cus
tody. The plaintiffs asked that a re
ceiver be appointed by the court to take
charge of the corporation's business. This
was done by the lower. court and an ap
peal was taken. : ';
The Supreme Court, after reviewing the
law relating to these corporations, con
cluded that while a receiver may be ap
pointed it does not follow that one should
have been appointed under the facts of
this case. Furthermore, the State is
neither a creditor nor stockholder and has
no pecuniary interest in the association.
It is neither alleged nor found that there
has been any fraud or mismanagement on
thÂ« part of the directors or officers or any
want of competency on their part to liqui
date the indebtedness of the institution
economically Â«nd In the interest of its
creditors and stockholders; and that it
was not necessary- to have appointed a
r*?colvâ¬*r. â  â¢
The order of the higher court was that
the Judgment of the lower court should
be modified as to the receiver, but In
other respects, as to straightening out the
affairs of the association, the judgment
should stand. This decision Is of no small
Importance, as It establishes the law
which must be applied to many similar
cases. It plainly shows that unless mis
management, Incompetency or fraud is
shown on the part of officers and directors
of building and loan associations the busi
ness of liquidating ought to be handled
by those in charge and not by a receiver
oimninted by the court. " "^

I. THE HOME CONSTRUCTION".
BY HELEN CAMPBELL.
'"If men lived like men Indeed, their btfases
would t^ temples, which we shoul* hardly dare
Injure and in which it woulj make us holy to
be permitted to live. â¢ â¢ â¢ I would have,
then, our ordinary dwelling houses built to ln?t.
and built to be lovely, as right and full of
pleasantness as may be, within and without,
and with such differences ns might express
each man's character and occupation and ;-art
ly his history."
In our American life, with Its perpetual
grasp for something better than its past
has known, each man may be said to
build a house to escape from rather than
to record his history. The majority pre
fer not to look backward, and the new
house enshrines no memory of the early
days of its owner, which may have been
in dug-out or log cabin or in one of the
uncompromisingly hideous little boxes
that make the suburbs of many cities.
But Ruskin, whose words open this pa
per, is as usual right in his demand that
the house of man shall be something it
seldom occurs to us to make Itâ a temple
wherein ordered and harmonious growth
may be a part of the dally life. The
house should be the best and utmost ex
pression of the home spirit; the best
adaptation of means to ends; the utmost
convenience and comfort for all under
its roof; the greatest ease in" necessary
work; the best space for individual as
well as family life. How is this to be
brought about? The plan is left to the
general builderâ the contractor, whose
business it is to make as much show for
the money spent as brain can contrive,
and to skimp and curtail in whatever is
out of sight. Cheap buildingâ houses
"made to sell"â is the first consideration.
Houses made to last and to improve with
age have not yet entered our thought of
construction.
At this point we see, then, certain needs
defining themselves, and we may well
group them under their distinct heads.
We are to consider
a. The individual plan.
b. Genera! sanitary aspects.
c. Materials and their handling.
d. Construction and its ethica.
In the limited space at command only
suggestions under each head can be given,
but it is hoped that the reader will gain
from them some new thought as to the
real nature of building and what it may
stand for in every human life. We have
first to consider, then,
The Individual Plan.
It will at once be insisted that there
can be no need of this, in face of the
fact that we have many books, large and
small, all devoted to the plans for all
sorts and conditions of men and their
dwelling places. There are admirable
ones to be mentioned, but this does not
affect In the slightest the discovery made,
by all who buy a house that they would
have built it quite differently at many
points. It is but very recently that the
architects' conference in one of our great
cities brought from one prominent mem
ber a recommendation that they turn
their attention to the architecture of farm
houses, and a better future thereby
awaits the farmer's wife and children,
at present compelled to live in structures
of a hideousnesK calculated to kill out
the sense of beauty as thoroughly as we
find it to be killed out in the mass of our
people.
This is one phase, and it applies to
workmen's houses of all degrees. Another
one and quite as Important is that ac
cording to the different pursuits of the
family should be the type of room of
fered them. A pair just beginning life
together may take the average flat or
small house. But presently, with chil
dren and their needs to consider, it is
found that the nursery or the living room
which must perhaps serve this purpose,
has no sun and thus is made unfit for
the growing child, whose birthright is
sunshine, and the strength and healing it
means for all. With the departure of the
old-fashioned garret, one playground for
the child, an invaluable one, since it gave
room for infinite "make-believe," vanished
also. Yet the child should have its own
play spot sacred from interference, pref
erably as remote from the other rooms as
possible, that its noise on rainy days may
not interfere with others; a place for
collections of all orders, for toys and
books and the tools the child loves to use,
and which are part of the training in use
of hand and brain together, that pres
ently we are all to know is the first es
sential of education.
All this is to be planned for, and it is
often possible to modify or alter the
formal plan of the architect and secure
this space. But the least skilled draughts
man can take pencil and paper, think out
the family needs as they have demon
strated themselves and see first how to
make a rough plan, then how to make
the available spaoe tell to the utmost for
family comfort. No matter how small the
sum, it will be better to do without a
formal parlor, we will pay, have a living
room ample and generous and put the
money saved into deadened floors and the
best finish. This matter of deadening
floors is seldom thought about, yet for the
most nervous people in Christendom it ia
an essential. "We all know the houses
where every sound is heard throughout,
and no escape for tired mother, for ailing
baby, for the invalid, if there be one, or
the patient who wants only quiet and rest
to come to strength speedily. In our
sounding-board houses this form of cure
is impossible, but it need not be. Plan,
then, to these ends, and see if there is not
an Instant gain in the conception of the
meaning of a house and what it is to
stand for in the family life.
General Sanitary Aspects.
This heading: means a volume. To un
derstand it fully there should be some
very earnest study, and the books best
adapted to this end are named in the little
bibliography accompanying this paper.
The shortest, most compact and most prac
tical is a manual prepared under the di
rection of one of the ablest of American
women, Mrs. Ellen H. Richards, professor
of chemistry in the Boston Institute of
Technology. "Home Sanitation" Is its
title, and it covers the ground for both
city and country as to the situation of the
house, its drainage and plumbing, its ven
tilation, heating and lighting, a set of
questions at the end of each delightfully
clear little chapter clinching all doubtful
points. There are many elaborate man
uals, but this and one or two others cover
all the ground and must be thoroughly
learned. A dry and well drained soil, a
house planned for as much sunshine as
possible in every room and perfect drain
age are the requisites for even the sim
plest dwelling. In the city the size of the
lot determines much. In the country it
can always be rejj^;ri"bered that it is by
no means necesswy to face the street
and that turning the house door to the
side may admit the sun to much better
advantage. Storerooms are better on the
north side for coolness, and the spare
room, less used probably than any other,
can much better dispense with the sun
than those in constant use. A little
thought over the general plan will settle
many questions of this nature.
Materials and Their Handling.
This is a matter supposed usually to be
quite beyond the comprehension of
women. Yet every woman can in a short
time learn the difference between good
and bad mortar, between seasoned and un
seasoned wood, between well laid courses
of brick and the makeshift which marks
much of the cheap building. She can
learn also what constitutes a good cellar
and good foundation, anil how a cellar
! floor should be made, with the virtue of
; cement and the value of smooth cellar
! walls. These are all phases of home sani
tation, and honest materials honestly put
together are an equal part of it. Crack
ing walls, settling and uneven floors, base
boards shrinking away and doors sagging
are due either to lack of knowledge or
lack of honesty on the builder's part. Wo
are a hasty people and kiln-dry our wood,
with no thought of the consequence. And
we are wedded to wood when all about is
another material more beautiful, more
durable and In many places less costly.
Common "rubble," the loose stone of the
neighborhood, put together with good
mortar and a course of brick here and
there, over windows, doors, etc., as fin
ish, wJli make a house beautiful to look
at, beloved of all climbing vines and pic
turesque under all conditions. Or there
may be a story of rubble and brick and
the upper portion finished in wood. But
architects â the thinking ones â urge more
and more the adoption of stone and brick
and give models within even very narrow
means.
Construction and Its Ethics.
Practically this 13 in great part included
in the heading "Materials." But there is
another point seldom thought of in the
matter of flimsy or substantial structure,
and that is the educational effect of hon
est workmanship, whether in house or its
finish and furnishing. The day for gin
gerbread work in house finish, the cheap
and most unbeautiful production of the
jigsaw, ia fast passing. Sanitation is
teaching us that smooth surfaces are not
only more healthful, since they give no
lodgment to bacteria, but are also more
beautiful. Veneers, save where wood Is of
so costly an order that it must be so used
or not at all, are also out of date. But we
still put cheap finish whenever we can,
covering half-mixed mortar in walls with
gay papers and making all out of sight
construction of the poorest quality of
wood. Our public buildings share often,
the same fate, because the sort of con
science that would not admit poor con
struction is not yet part of our teaching.
These things are to be a necessity, when
we are a little wiser, In all education, and
when that good day comes even our poli
ticians will have been so drilled in what
constitutes honest building that we shall
have a new order of homes and of public
buildings.
LIâ THE HOME ENVIRONMENT.
Here again we have the possibilities of
a volume In our title, but being held rig
idly to the limits of a column or two can
only outline certain points that bear upon
all homes, whether rich or poor. In city
or country. Four phases present them
selves:
a. A new thought about building.
b. Possibilities of a back yard.
c. Building for privacy.
(1. A new phase of factory work for the horn*.
This question of the home environment
is like all the rest that bear upon ways
of living made easy or difficult by the
depth of the purse. But for the rich or
those of moderate purses there must be
first of all some sense of beauty and fit
ness or the story of their lack will be
plain to read in every line of the build
ing and its surroundings. The country
home should seem to have grown natur
ally in the spot where we find it, even
If set close among its neighbors. The
city house is limited in expression by the
narrow space upon which it stands, yet
even this, as we shall presently see, is
capable of different treatment, and is al
ready receiving it. But for every town
and village that has come to the sense
of beauty sufficiently to desire the best
arrangement and planning a harmonious
whole, it is still possible to reconstruct
at least a part of the space occupied.
The time is nearing when the smallest
settlement will be subject to building
laws laid down by competent authorities,
and every house will be planned with re
lation to its effect to the whole. Now
nnd from the beginning it has all been
chance work, and the thought of a gen
eral unity of plan and effect absolutely
unknown. Public buildings have been at
the mercy of mere contractors, and each
town has been a mere jumble of inco
herences. A change in this respect
means a change in the whole handling of
every phase of building; the growth of
the civic sense and of that sense of a
common obligation to make the most and
best of every opportunity for larger, hap
pier living. To this end a group of friends
who purpose building could easily take
counsel together, pool their resources, em
a thinking architect and start in
with a definite conception of what plan
of planting and building would produce
the best results. The very fact of hav
ing begun With this united purpose would
give a different expression to the whole.
As we do and have already done, a town,
even with the best natural advantages,
fails to show them to real advantage.
The wealthier people are planted in the
best places, and when it is presently dis
covered that parks and boulevards and
free access to a lake or river, for in
stance, are required as public needs,
every desirable foot of ground has already
been appropriated and everybody wonders
why nobody thought about it in the be
ginning.
Some thought and plan, then, Is what
all must take with them who m3ke a
country home. Suppose, however, that
one must live in a block. Even then we
are by no means so helpless as we have
believed. The great apartment houses
have shown us how much comfort can
be increased by the lessening of labor,
a common heating apparatus and plumb
ing system doing away at once with some
of the heaviest labor of the private home,
the care of fire and all the dirt and trou
ble of coal and ashes. A well-known
Brooklyn builder, Alfred White, who put
up the first model tenement houses, has
since built a block of small houses, the
first one in this country, about an open
conrt with fountains, trees and shrubs.
No millionaire's house has more perfect
finish, and building an entire block at
once the expense for each house was so
reduced as to enable the landlord to rent
them for less than the same sum charged
for individual houses. On a small city
lot there seems no chance for change.
Not long ago one of our best and most
progressive architects, Russell Sturgis,
told us in a popular magazine how to
build on a city lot so that there might
be an actual front yard planted in such
fashion, all given in detail, drawing by
drawing, that the street seemed quite put
away.

Mail advices from New York say: "The j
week's markets have been more satisfactory
than any previous week this season. There
have bsvn r.o particularly large sales, but the ,
aggregate of s.-m.Il ones has made a heavy j
business. Commission men have not done so j
well takins the week as a whole, as they
hale during some previous week*, .but Jobber*
report a very active trade, comprising fair pro- }
portions of "all varieties. Demand is Increas- .
iIK rapidly, and business is upon a much
more encouraging basis than ii was at the
close of any week this year. .
â prunes arc considered rather unsatisfac- .
tory goods to buy at present? [because ofSthe
variation of prices owing to the impossibilit> |
of securing certain desired sizes. Forties, com
mand a premium of >4c and SO-Ws are Quoted
up "4@Wc when nought by themselves. Hold
ers are "very cautious about letting the large j
sizes and the small ores go, but sell Instead,
wherever possible, three sizes at So basis, f.
o I. . in bags. The four sizes are held a trille
Bt liter and a few sellers say they have re- I
eelved better than 3c, but the statement is i
unconfirmed. There is unquestionably a better
feeling in the market, however, and an ad
vance is expected at any time.
"There are numerous small sales of raisins.
New crop stocks are beginning to arrive, and
trade is now active on that account. No large'
transactions are reported, but negotiations for
Borne important transfers a:-e !n progress. Out
elde goods are selling with considerable free
dom below association figures, but compara
tively few can be offered, and what thÂ»nÂ» are
â will exert little intlu-nce in ihj mr.et. )
"Peaches are not so active ns they have
been, but sales are still heavy at full ijuoted
prices. The bulk of the selling on the coast j
is for Western delivery, but there are some j
Eastern buyers who are taking good supplies, i
An interesting statement is made regarding i
the en. p. It Is said that the output is not so
large as has been said, and that there may be
a more or less serious shortage of desirable
qualities later. This is given as one reason |
for the constant improvement in prices, and j
indicates that jitrhaps peaches will prove bet
ter property than was anticipated.
"Apricots move with moderate freedom on
Fmall orders. Stocks ire virtually in second '
hands, which compel.* the payment of high
prices for the bulk of purchases.
"Figs are steady, but sales are liberal. Cali

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 20.â The point of greatest
Interest in today's stock market was the ac
tive speculation in Pullman, which was rushed
â¢up after yesterday's sharp reaction an ex
treme :>V. points to 207%. a record price. The
motive was the official confirmation of the
merging of the Pullman and Wagner Palace
.Car Companies, which the stock tape bat fore
shadowed for some time past. The published
assertion that the Vanderbilts are to get the
Pullman holdings of Boston and Albany and
Boston and Maine stocks as an Incident to the
dÂ»ai and that the New York Central would
thus gain control of New England railroad
affitlrs, gave the bulls an opportunity for an
active* speculation in New York Central. They
lifted the price of the stock an extreme 3**.
Th â¢ Influence of this movement on the rest of
the list was marked, the other Vamlerbllt
ttoeks. of course, moving most closely in sym
pathy. The bears covered heavily all through
the list. The prominent Industrial specialties
were most affected especially sugar and
Brooklyn Transit, the dealings In which were
very large. The hesitation which had been i
caused earlier in the day by marked weak
ness of the glucose stocks and by sympathy
of other Industrials was overcome by th'! j
strength of Pullman and New York Central, i
and prices of the railroads rose quite gener
ally above last night's level. The easing of i
the rate for sterling exchange encouraged the
rise, but it gave way to profit-taking In the
last hour, when the preliminary estimates of
the movement of money for the week appeared
and the rate for call money stiffened to 3 per
cent.
The most active stocks reacted a point and
in Pullman the reaction extended to nearly
seven points. There was ].â ,â¢> rally before
the close, which was firm and at small net
gains for most stocks. The strength Of tli<Â»
market, however, was not widely distributed,
and in fact was almost wholly confined to the
few most active stocks. The banks have
trained slightly from the sub- treasury on rou
tine operations by reason of continued large
disbursements for Government expenditures
and on account of anticipated interest. But
the outgo of money to the interior has been
heavy. The week's shipments by some large
banks have been the largest of the season.
The net result is estimated by experts at a
loss in cash by the banks of nearly $2,000,000.
The easing of the exchange ra,te, in spite of
a slight hardening in the London discount rate,
was significant. The outgo of gold to London
may be averted, but it will be ljecause of a
higher money rate here. Interior rates for New
York exchange show no cessation of demand
from those quarters.
The activity In bonds was somewhat de
creased and there was weakness at some points.
Total sales, par value, 470,000.
United States bonds unchanged In the bid
quotations.

Bradstrect's Financial Review.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â Bradstreefs, In IU
review of the New York stock market to-mor
row, will Fay:
Ftlcps improved this week, the stock market
slow In? a rally from the depression caused
by tight money and the South African war.
Early in the week a better tone appeared in
the loan market, rates for money on call de
clining to 43J.5 per cent, wltjj 6 per cent as
the extreme. The completion of the large set
tlement connected with the Central Pacific re
adjustment also relieved the money market
!]â  m f.-:trs of further generaJ disturbance of
lrans. and it would appear tt>at large Inter
ests were encouraged to give renewed support
to advance their' specialties. The buying pow
er was maJnly supplied by a large short In
terest which had accumulated during the pant
month. The market, at the same time, is sen
sitive to the financial conditions here and
abroad. The easier tone In the New
York money market Is calculated to
facilitate a movement of gold from
thi* side to London, which the temporary
fulling off of grain exports, the scarcity of.
commercial bills of exchange and the rise of
sterling rates to J4 S7'<i rendered a possibility.
The fact that the London money market in
being carefully tended and kept free from dis
turbance as a preparation for an expected war
loan might Involve the Bank of England's
taking advantage of these exceptional condi
tions and procuring some millions of gold from
New York. It was, of course, recognised that
such a movement could not be very large nor
continue for any time, yet the stock market
was Inclined to watch this part of the situa
tion with much attention. The firmness of
the London stock market continued and there
was even some buying at times from that
quarter, while on Friday the news of Prlt
ish success in the first engagements stimulated
London and had an effect on prices here.
Btadstreefs on Trade.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â Pradstreet'B to-mor
row will cay: More nearly perhaps than ever
before does the volume of general trade and
industry tax existing transportation facilities
handling tlie Fame. From nearly all parts of
the country, but particularly from the West
nnd South, come reports of car scarcity. Sonve
of this congestion seems to be the result of a
diversion of traffic ordinarily carried on by
water routes to already crowded railroads. The
inability of present transportation facilities
to cope with the existing situation Is, how
ever, not confined to domestic trade lines. From
both coasts of this country come reports of
insufficient tonnage offering to handle goods
seeking a foreign outlet and freight rates are
, msiderably higher than they were a year or
more ago. This latter feature, in fact, is one
which may have Important .-fleets upon our
foreign trade during the balance of the year.
With few notable exceptions prices continue
strong. A number of lines have advanced quo
tation*, while the great body of staple articles
manifest all their old firmness. Some weak
ness in wheat prices is directly traceable to
higher fre-ight rates, because of the partial
cl.xdng of the door to relief from growing do
mestic storks. Touching the wheat situation,
however, it may be said that while present
statistics of stocks of domestic and European
are bearish estimates of the year's crop"con
tinue to afford strength to the bulls' position.
An average of five leading European estimates
points to a world's crop this year not far from
00,000 bushels and a falling off of 825,000,-
Oi>) to 376.000,00 bushels from last year is in
dicated, against which, of course, is to be
reckoned Increased supplies, visible and in
visible, of at least two-thirds of that amount.
Raw wool is tinner and even higher on better
demand at the East, some heavy speculative
transactions being reported. The strength of
lumber Is apparently undiminished, though
supplies are reported more liberal at some
markets, but lumber mills are very generally
reported rushed with orders.
Returns of export tra.de do not as yet reflect
the effect of recent advances in freight rates
and show th" movement of merchandise abroad
I during September to have been the best re
j corded for that month, being 22 per cent larger
tban a year ago anil ~..fi per cent larger than
September two years ago. For the nine months
our exports exceed those of 1898 by 4 per cent,
a maintenance of which gain would indicate a
total export for the calendar year of 1899 of
| $1,300,000,000, which total, however, may be still
| further exceeded if the freight situation Im
proves. ,
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4.160,618 bushels, against 5,263,
--f.34 last week, 4.2^2. <7s In the corresponding
week of 1898, 5,652,171 in 1897, 4,007,271 in lS9(i
] and 2,658,554 in 1895.

Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â R. O. Dun ft Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
In must lines business continues to expand,
though In some there are signs that Inlying has
been checked, either because prices have out
run the views of buyers or because recent pur
chases have been so heavy that nobody is left
in need. Prices are still advancing, in almost
every line supported by rising prices of ma
terials, arnl works everywhere are still crowded
to their utmost capacity, while at many points
it is found hard to get enough competent hands.
Hut the volume of business expressed in values
rises much more than prices, showing a re
markable increase in quantities of goods ex
changed.
The outbreak of war in South Africa has
brought no such changes as many feared. In
England the markets have treated it as an
event already overdiscounted, and relations
with this country were not appreciably af
fected. The outgo of cotton is just now
checked, but of other great Btaples and manuf
acturers' pr< ducts the foreign demand is sur
prisingly SUM;.
Wheat has declined i'Â» â  In price in spite of
unfavorable crop reports; and Western receipts
do not keep up with the unprecedented move
ment of last year, having been but 23,454,400
bushels, against $0,592,494 bushels during three
weeks of October last year. But Atlantic ex
erts. Hour Included, have been in three weeks
of October 10, 6711.216 bushels,
bushels last year, and Pacific exports 1,539.188
bushels, against 2,289,312 bushel! last year. Be-
I iubt prices would rise far and fast with
such a foreign demand if Âiti;.'.l and other
current reports of yield were fully en
i lorn exports ha^ c been in 1 - 1,924, -

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Oct. 20. - Heaviness nbroo.l and
free Argentine shipments to Europe started
â¢wheat weak and lower. The bears were In
clined to work within nnrruw limits, howeve r,
and as the market at the outset was consid
erably under put figures, a partial recovery
followed on buying against privileges. Cov
ering by shorts, owing to moderate domestic
receipts and the strength developed by corn,
also added somewhat to the upturn. The liqui
dation, however, was of sufficient volume to
prevent anything like an enduring advance,
and as the demand was short lived the mar
ket soon started on the down grade again. The
bean were disinclined to push their advantage,
â¢and trade finally became so dull that for an
hour in the middle of the session there was
scarcely any change in price. Finally longs,
who had been waiting for an upturn to un
lnnd, l"St patience, and offerings becoming
quite plentiful the market gave way under the
pressure and ended up at the bottom of the
day's range. Indications of. an Increase of
2,000,000 bushels in the visible supply this |
week hastened the decline. December opened |
%c lower at 70% c. sold sparingly at 70%e, ad- |
vanced to 70% c, declined to V. and closed
with sellers at 70VÂ«Â®70%c.
Corn was relatively strong and active. Poor
husking returns and a steady increase on local
Stock! encouraged general buying, but the
weakness of wheat had an unfavorable effect
and the advance was lost. December closed
at 30% c.
There was very little trading in oats and
. what little fluctuation occurred was due al
most entirely to sympathy with corn. Decem
ber closed at 22%@22%c.
Provisions were tame and featureless, prices
just about holding their own. January pork

is much duller than it has been. Cheese is in
light supply ami unchanged. Eggs, though still
scarce ami firm, are also quieter, as the re

steep prices.

it is close calculation to see where the

for steam coals is also very brisk, in fact,
contractors are close pushed to keep up their
agreed deliveries, and are not over solicitous
to make sales for future requirements. The
present fuel congestion will be relieved a few
months hence, when the services of several re
cently engaged steamers shall be brought Into
requisition, as our former fleet of sailers which
were utilized as coast coal carriers, have ac
cepted foreign business which proves more
profitable. Foreign coal is coming- along very
slowly, and but little is being loaded, notwith

Butter" and Cheese sell at last week's prices.
Most of the Butter trade is In pickled kinds, as
fresh Butter is now too dear for the average
citizen. 'Eggs are still dearer and scarce.
Poultry is in good supply at about last week's
prices. Game Is cheaper, as receipts are more
liberal.
The summer fruits and vegetables continue to
pet dearer as the season draws to a close, and
both will soon disappear.
Fish is in light supply, owing to the storm.

itch to The '""all.
WASHINGTON: Oct. 20.â Mr. Tower,
the British Charge here, called at the 1
State Department to-day and handed to
Secretary Hay a note formally accepting
for his Government the proposition fot |
the temporary adjustment of the Alaskan j
boundary line, proposed by Secretary Hay
in his note of yesterday. "With that note
â¢the long-expected modus Vivendi relative i
to the vexed boundary question went into ]
â¦â¢fTeot. The result has been brought about j
Through the direct negotiation of Secre- j
tary Hay and Mr. Tow^r after several !
failures in the past. The State Depart- j
mr-nt is confident that it has conserved i
the American Interests In the matter i
"without unjustly treating Canada. '
The divisional line on the west by the |
Dalton trail Is placed twenty-two and a
quarter miles above Pyramid Harbor,
â¢which is regarded under the treaty as j
"tidewater mark, so the Canadians are not ;
allowed to reach any point on the Lynn !
Canal. Moreover, there is no permission i
given for a free port or even for the free !
transfer across American territory of Ca- j
nadlan goods, except of miners' belong- j
ings. These matters may figure later, ;
when it comes to a permanent boundary ;
line, but they are not touched upon a this >
modus.
The modus Vivendi follows the precedent j
<-stahllshed by Secretary Evarts In i>T~- In ;
agreeing upon a temporary boundary on j
tha Sticklne River in Alaska by an ex- |
change of notes.
The line on the Chilkat River is twenty i
two and a quarter statute miles from the
head of navigation on Chilkat Inlet of j
Lynn Canal, and on the Klehini River ;
twelve miles farther Inland, and the whole j
valley of the Porcupine is included within
the American lln>-s. As to White and ;
< 'hilki passes, the line is fixed at me I
summit, or watershed, being the points I
which for some time past have been oh- i
served by tho customs authorities of the
two countries.
The text of the modus Vivendi as finally i
agreed to Is as follows:
It is hereby agreed between thÂ« governments I
of the United States and it Great Britain >
that the boundary â¢â â¢â¢ between Canada and j
the Territory of Alaska in the region about |
the head of Lynn Cnnal shall be provisionally j
fixed without prejudice to thÂ« claims of either
party in the permanent adjustment of the in- i
ternational boundary a? follows:
In the region of the Dalton trail, a li: be- !
ginning at the peak west of Porcupine Creek !
marked on map No. 1 of the United States ;
Commission, ]>ecember 11. 1?.<5. and on sheet i
Xo. IS of the British Commission, December !

the Klehini (or Klaheeta) River in thÂ° dlrec- |
tion of the pf-ak north of that river, marked ;

y>2. r . on the aforesaid British map; thence fol- j
lowing the hijjh or right bank of the sail ;
Klehlnt River to the Junction thereof with the
Chilkat River, a mile and a half, more or |

shall be freely permitted to follow the trail !
between the said creek and *he said junction
of the rivers into and across the territory on :
the Canadian side of the temporary Urn* wher- i
ever the trail crosses to such side, and sub
ject to such reasonable regulations for the pro
tectlon of the revenue as the Canadian Gov
ernment may prescribe to carry with them
over such parts or part of the trnll between
the said points as may lie on the. Cnnadian
side of the temporary line such /roods and
articles as they desire without being requested
to pay any customs duty en such articles;
and from said junction to tr.r summit of the
peak east of the Chilkat River marked on th^

a cattle range in charge of the brothers,
twenty miles northeast nf this city.
The killing waa the outcome of a quarrel
over the: .settlement of a pasture bill due
by Gregg, who had gone to the ranch to
get stork. Gregg*B brother-in-law, a boy
in his employ; and a man in the employ
of the Hungerforda; saw the shooting and
their evidence goes to show that the Hun

ed great interest in the county, as all the
men belong here and have many friends.
The prosecution closed its case to-day at
noon and little testimony for the defense
was offered before court adjourned to

WASHINGTON, Oct. 20.-The Secretary

clined to permit Mrs. L. M. Todd to be
deported to Hawaii In a Government

OF YACHT RACE

j James Gor-
H-nnrtt.
LONDON, Oct. 20.â This has been a ter
ribly exciting day for London, between
news of the heavy fighting In Natal,
where the British arms gained victory
over the Boers, and the hammer-and
tongs race for the America's cup. The
public was almost mad In the note's,
where the Marconi bulletins were posted!
as they came in with a rapidity which
kept tile messengers on their bicycles in
a continuous state of perspiration
In the Carlton Hotel in particular the
greatest excitement .prevailed. In the
< arlton, of course, there are staying a
great many American Continental visit
ors besides English. Thc-y waited all th*
evening in feverish anxiety to learn th >
progress of that wonderful race
Immediately after the bulletin arrived
that the Columbia was a mile and a ha'f <
m advance of the challenger It was '
thought that the game was ail up Then >
-shortly after 7-when it was announced
that Shamrock was gaining the ex
citement became acute again.
In a few minutes more it was learned
that the Shamrock had cut down the lead
of the Columbia from a half mile to less
than a quarter. The surprise was great
incitement knew no bounds and Sir I
Thomas Lipton's partisans cheered The- j
usually imperturbable calm of the Amer
icans gave way to nervous anxiety i
though at the same time they admitted '
that the Shamrock deserved success and
they almost made up their minds tor an
other day's sport.
At about a quarter-past 7 the news
again arrived that the Shamrock was
gaining continually and was likely to
make a close finish.
Nothing could now describe the scene
The people waited breathlessly, anxious
ly, with nerves strained to the" uttermost
Only a quarter of a mile bind! Was!
the Shamrock to win after all? Then a
wait; till congratulations for the Colum
bia and congratulations for Sir Thomas
Lipton, too, mingled with sympathy.
"It was a great race," said everybody.
"There never was such sport."
"Pity the Shamrock had not won to
have afford* another day like It."
At Ear la Court, where the race was Il
lustrated with two pretty model yachts
on Queens Court Lake, an even greater
scene than in the hotels was witnessed.
How the crowd cheered as in the later ;
stage of the race the Shamrock drew up! ;
The crowd shouted in its excitement for !
â¢ ; time, then set itself in absolute silence I
to watch the fight and to wait. On that â 
mimic water course it could see the race
enacted, thanks to the Marconi bulletins,
with absolute fidelity.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATUKDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1599.
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
UNEASINESS AT
THE HOME FOR
DEAF AND DUMB
Board Is Doing Some
Quiet Work.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 20.
The best political story of the hour cen
ters around the Deaf and Dumb and Blind
Institute. A month ago the directors
â  I l>r. 1). D. llanilin to the office of
physician. As previously published, Dr.
Wall of Berkeley claims that he is the
incumbent and cannot be removed at will.
Not only is Dr. Wall interested, but many
other employes of the home, who fear
that if the as should begin to descend it
may go deeper than Is pleasant.
Nobody seems able to explain just how,
but liiere is an idea prevalent that Super
intendent Wilkinson is anxious to retain
Dr. Wall, not that he prefers one doctor
to another, but because there are em
; â¢: . m the institution whom the super
intendent does wish to retain and he does
not desire to set? so unpleasant a prece
dent established. Past boards of directors
have not interfered much with the man
agement of the home, and the manner in
which tue present board has started out
to attend to its duties is somewhat un
usual.
Dr. Wall has filed his usual bill right
along and makes his regular calls, and so
Dr Flamlln, and the superintendent
is considerably puzzled. There is an idea
thai be should peremptorily forbid Dr.
Wall to ha vi- anything to do with the in
stitution in any manner and that his not
taking such ;> decisive stand is suggestive
of an Inclination to tight Dr. i-lamlin and
Incidentally the directors.
S ime of the members have been pro
curing data from similar institutions In
different parts of the world ami are mak
ing comparisons with the Berkeley In
stitute. The present superintendent has
been i:i charge ever since the place was
founded thirty-four years ago. and it has
largely developed according to his ideas.
Since Its foundation the science of edu
cating the deaf and dumb and blind lias
made marvelous progress, and the direct
ors are anxious that the institute shall be
the peer of any similar place anywhere.
While there is apparently no disposition
at this time to make any change in the
head of the institution, the action of the
directors la causing some uneasiness at
the home, and it is not Impossible that
some expert teachers from the ISast may
soon be considered a desirable Innovation.

BRIGHT FUTURE FOR
SPORT IN OAKLAND
OAKLAND, Oct. 20.â "Now that
there is but one club in the center
of town there is a very bright
future for legitimate sport." said
R. M. Fitzgerald, president of the Re
liance Club. "The very best of the
membership of the Acme Club has
Joined us and we shall soon have a
very large roll of membership, far
larger than any single club would
have attained in years had there still
been two clubs. When we came to this
new building we brought a debt of
?10,00fl with us and we have reduced
this to $4200. which we shall booh be
able to pay off. I'nlike some dubs, we
have never sacrificed the standing of
the membership of the Reliance when
we were in a tight place. I mean that
we have never reduced our fees so that
hundreds could ffoek in when we were
in need of filling the treasury. We
have gone deep into our pockets to
meet just such contingencies. The Re
liance Club, whether viewed from its
athletic or social features, is fitted out
completely, and although our dues are
somewhat higher than are those of the
Acme, we shall not reduce them. The
Acme men, who have joined the Re-
Uance have all come voluntarily, there
having been no coalition of the two
clubs.
"Now that we see our way clearly
some of the best programmes ever seen
them at least once a month."

"ANDREW J. HOLLYWOOD,
"Collector."
The above letter, received by the Board
of Trade, furnished matter for a brief dis-
I cusslon by that body this morning. The
] whole matter of harbor improvements
! was brought up, ;i:d the debate ended by
Instructing thi special committee on har
bor matters to work with the Govern
ment engineers to have the dredging of
lower Oakland harbor finished before the
work on the ti<ial cajial was done.
It was decided to hold a public meet
ing very shortly, when th<> proposition
woqld be discussed and local representa
tives to Congress would be instructed to
do all in their power to get a Government
drydock constructed in this city.
The board feels that Oakland is not
treated with the dignity its Importance
demands, and this was backed up by the.
report of Collector Hollywood, which was
written on paper without a letterhead be
cause no better facilities exist in the local
Custom-house.
The board authorized President Mars ton
to appoint two other members to act with
himself as a delegation to the conserva
tion of flood-water convention which
meets in San Francisco November it.
Such matters as the loss of eight ves
sels' dockage in a single week, and the
location of the Government transport:* on
the other side of the bay when they could
be handled on this side with more, con
venience and less expense if the estuary
was deep enough and If the proper
wharves were built, were more than
ordinarily annoying to thÂ»- directors.

Parlor of the Native Sons of
the Golden West.
Stanford Parlor of the Native Sons of
the Golden West gave a vaudeville enter
tainment last evening In Native Son*'
Hull, and despite the inclemency of the
weather and the fact that so many went
to the Pavilion, there was an audience
that crowded the gallery and comfortably
Riled the main body of the halL
The crowning feature of the programme
was the grand ballet, in Which Missea
Grace and Anna Shean were premieres and
Mile Bchlelcherelli was the secunda, and
Hi. iv were seven coryphees Signorinaa
Nyeonto, l,auringlni, Stangeth, Madde
lupi. Lenisini, Steeletto and Coenetii.
They wore the conventional costume of
ballet girls and presented a fine appear
ance; out aside from the Shean sisters
(!:â¢â¢ ballet was a clever travesty on th<.Â»
delight of the baldheads, who, unaware of
the scheme, crowded the front two rows
The coryphees were all numbers of the
parlor, a.s is also "Mile." Schieicberelll,
who is none other than A. F. Schleicher
The absurdity of the affair, presented
with limelight :i!..i colored glass acce
sorles, was what gained for it frequent
applause, and tin- dancing of tin- se
cunda, who looked like a skeleton encased
;n lights, together with the dancing of
ihe others, created much laughter.
The other numbers on the programme
were: Overture, "Merry-go-round," Del
lepiane'a orchestra: mandolin selections.

William 11. I.eahy of the Tivoll Opera

This was unquestionably one of the
(lnest exhibitions of cakewalklng ever
presented. It took with the audience,

INGERSOLL CONDEMNED
BY DR. VOORSANGER
The Rabbi Contends That the Agnos-
tic Asked Questions Like a
Spiritual Anarchist.
Despite the heavy downpour last night
there was a large attendance at the Tem
ple Emunu-El to listen to Dr. Voorsang
er's lecture on "Robert Ingersoll and the
Bible." At the outset of the discourse
the dflctor commented on the sympathy
displayed by the public for the loss of the
famous agnostic. Ho called attention to
the old Human custom of speaking well
of the dead and forgiving and forgetting
all mistakes made by a public servant.
He cited the suicide of Nero and said ho
supposed that at his death Nero was
given credit for being a benefactor, a dis
penser of gratuity and who assisted In
developing the great architectural beauty
of Rome, whereas the student of history
will only know of his debauchery and im
morality.
The speaker declared that he had no
idea of classing Ingersoll with Nero. He
said Ingersull was a very remarKable
man, whose life was clean and pure, and
that he had many- admirable qualities.
That he should be commended for not
believing that a public office was a pri
vate trust or that it was an invitation to
the spoil; that he believed in the eg i
of womanâ the mutual responsibility of
man and womanâ and that he appreciated
the strength of family ties. So far as a
consideration of moral life was concerned
there was nothing to object to in Ingersoll.
The doctor said he once thought that
[ngersoll was merely a business man who
translated his uncanny questions for
profit, but he said It would not be fair to
think so if one reviews his remarkable
life.
"The Question Is, then. Where did . c
offend?" continued the Rabbi. "Ingersoll
was a type and Â«-n]!><iiliment of a cross
examiner, who preached the Scriptures
like a lawyer. Hut you cannot approach
I God by the methods that prevail in a Po
lice Court; neither can you approach re
ligion by the methods of the chemist or
by the operations and theories of a math
ematician. Religion is a field of its own,
has v vocabulary all its own and must
tx proved by men specially schooled. Mr
fngersoll had a constitutional light to ask
questions, but he did not ask them with
I the reverence of a pious interrogator; but
like a man who throws a bomb of dyna
mite before the eyes of his mother! If
he was right In asking questions he exer
cised that right like a spiritual an
i archlst."
In concluding the doctor remarked that
Ingersoll was a great lawyer but a very
I r Bible student; that the man who
could charge Juries and fascinate thou
sands of people was a very poor theoio
glan; that he unwisely 'bought that by
ridicule he could throw discredit on the
old Hebrew literature. The doctor said
Ingersoll defeated himself because he did
not prepare himself.

MRS, LEIGHTON
NOW FILES SUIT
FOR A DIVORCE
Says She Was Cruelly
Neglected.
Oakland Office San Francisco CaP,
908 Broadway, Oct. â '.'>â 
Mrs. Virginia F. Lelghton, who as Miss
Stocker in her younger days was well
known in society circles here and in East
Oakland, Tiled suit in the Superior Court
to-day for a divorce from Elven E. Leigh
ton, The complaint, prepared by Attorney
J. W. Cochrane of San Francisco, recites
a story of cruelty and neglect.
The parties were married in January,
1890, after a very short courtship. Leigh
t' n at the time \v:ts a young dry goods
clerk of d-ishiiiy appearance, and the
couple lived happily for a few months at
Fruitvale. Soon Leighton wearied of
home life, however, and stayed out at un
seemly hours, neglecting his young bride,
until matters became exceedingly inhar
monious. The wife charges that when she
remonstrated and pleaded with him he
slapped her face and hurled vile epithets
at her; and that on one occasion he
packed his grip and left, not returning
until about nine months later. Mrs.
Leighton asks for an absolute separation,
custody of the minor child, Lucille, and
that the household furniture be set apart
for her use.
Florence McGnwan also commenced di
vorce proceedings to-day against Warren
W. MoGowan, alleging statutory grounds.
Jutige Greene this afternoon granted
Jennie Montgomery a divorce from John
Montgomery on the ground of extreme
cruelty. The trouble between 'hi couple

JUDGE HUNT ASTONISHED.
His Honor Battled by an Action for
Personal Damages.
For many months A. Sohr and wife
have lodged in the Hotel Francisco, on
Turk and Taylor streets, and their land
lord, James King, has been moving in all
illrr-ctlons to get the couple dislodged be
cause of the non-payment of rent. Col
lectors Innumerable neve r ri â¢ -< i to got the
money due and have failed. The rent had
been raised, but to no purposo. In fact,
all of the expedients known to landlords
came to naught. At last the desperate
King decided to take the matter to the
courts, and ho asked Attorney Abbott to
be*ln an action for unlawful detainer.
When the case came up before Judge
Hunt yesterday Sohr was present, but
loaded with a cross-complaint that fairly
made the Judge and Attorney Abbott
Rasp for breath. Sohr asked the court
to grant him $5000 damages for personal
injuries to Mrs. Sohr"a health.
In the cross-complaint he recited that
previous to their troubles Mrs. Sohr was
In perfect health; that on account of the
fear that the landlord and his emissaries
would remove the belongings of the Sohr
family his wifi- was compelled to remain
in her room for a period of six weeks and
that this, combined with the demands of
the landlord and collectors for money due
caused his wife to become afflicted with
heart disease. Nothing short of $5000 dam
ages would compensate for this Injury to
the woman's health.

the fine with no alternative, and' Carpen

SEVEN STATES
EXTEND A HAND
TO CALIFORNIA
Mining Counties to
Send Men.
The eighth annual convention of th*
California Miners' Association, and the
biggest one In its history,, will begin its
brewing in the hotel lobbies to-day with
the early arrival of many of the several
hundred delegates.
On Sunday morning the reception and
business headquarters of the State Asso
ciation will be opened by Secretary Ben
jamin in the chief corner suites of the
i Palace Hotel, of which door 162 will be
the entrance. Typewriters and assistants
will be on hand to aid the secretary in
assisting and directing incoming delegates
J and In helping committees which will
' hold preliminary meetings on Sunday and
on Monday morning.
The committee on dams, of which A.
Camlnetti of Amador is chairman, haa
been called to meet at headquarters on
Sunday evening. Other committees will
I have meetings before the convention
meets.
Ser-retary E. H. Benjamin has been for
days nearly swamped with the corre
spondence and other business prepara
tions preceding the convention. Yester
day thirty eounti-s of California had re
ported lists of delegates, and the Gover
nors of seven Pacific Coast States had
announced their lists of appointed dele
pates In response to the recent invitation
to them that their State join in making
this convention an Interestate affair as far
as the paramount questions of a cabinet
! department of mines, the reservation of
mineral public lands and the conserva
tion of water are concerned. The .seven
States from which delegates have been
accredited are Nevada. Arizona. New
Mexico, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming
and Washington. Idaho is yet to be heard
from. These Western States and Terri
tories are supposed to send ten delegates
each and whatever number comes will be
royally welcomed.
Secretary Benjamin's correspondence of
yesterday 'announced fifty delegates from j
the ten i-ountles of the Southern Califor
nia branch of the association, along with !
a good many other things. One Item
worthy of more mention than is contained
in this sentence is contained in yester- |
day's report that the miners employed in !
j the Kennedy and South Eureka mines of !
i Amador County had Joined the affiliating .
j county association of Amador County, j
; This means $12: i5O for the treasury of the I
: State Association, according to the ap- :
! portlonment of yearly dues, and brings to
i mind the harmonious way in which the
working miner, the mining capitalist, the i
â¢ mine superintendent and the mining busi
| ness man in San Francisco and In the
mining regions are federated for the com
mon Industrial good in the California
Miners' Association.
Mayor Phelan, Senator George C. Per- j
kins and Congressmen de Vries and Kahn !
were among those who had yesterday for- '
mally accepted invitations to address the j
convention. Secretary Benjamin's official i
returns of yesterday showed that thirty !
counties of California and seven other Pa- !
cine Coast States had named their quotas !
i of delegates, and more are to be heard
j from.
The biggest and most important repre
sentative gathering the mining industry
! has known will begin a three days' ses
sion on Monday. It will be made up of
men of eminent character and ability and
will consider many questions- of impor- !
tance to the whole industrial interest of
the great West as well as to the mining
industry alone.
