MISS GRANT BECOMES
CANTACUZENE'S BRIDE
Famous Union General's Granddaughter
Married to the Russian Prince Accord
ing to Episcopal Church Rites,
NEWPORT. U. 1.. Sept 25.â At
noon to-day the American cere
mony, according to the rites
"f the Proteatani Episcopal
Church; following the Russian
service la g, made Miss Julia
Dent Grant, daugbtef of General and
Mrs. Frederick Dent Grant and grand
daughter of President Grant, the wife
ol Prince Cantacuzene, count Sper
nnski. it was the closing and crowning
social event of the Newport season, and
one of the most brilliant affairs of the
kind ever chronicled in the soiial an
nals of this city.
The reasons for this second marriage
ceremony have already been well ex
plained. The ceremony to-day was cel
ebrated in that unpretentious edifice.
All Saints' Church, and the ritual
was that of th.' Protestant Episcopal
Church, which, if brief, is decidedly Im
pressive. The;.' were two clergymen
and a Bishop in the chancel, some
beautiful music and all that goes
to make up a lovely wedding, and,
above all, the glorious sunshine that all
brides wish- for.
The assembly of invite, l guests, nota
ble for social arid military distinctions,
made the ceremony one of the most
brilliant ever witnessed ai Newport.
The family and social connections of
the bride gave to the wedding a mili
tary as well as a diplomatic character,
and the little church in which it took
place was bright with blue and gold,
the bridegroom's uniform easily out
shining those of the Home Guard.
A large number of the Newport sum
mer colony had delayed thfir departure
to attend the wedding, which came as
a climax to one of the gayest seasons
ever known at this popular resort.
Right Rev. c. Potter, Protestant
Episcopal Bishop of New York, assisted
â¢v. Dr. Nevins of the American
Church in Rome, officiated, but. in ac
cordance with the laws of the State of
Rhode island. Rev. E>r. Porter of the
Emanuel Church of this city read that
portion of the set vice which legally
united the distinguished pair.
A reception followed the wedding
( eremony at the Palmer residence and
;his afternoon the Prince and
Princess left for New York and St.
Petersburg.
All Saints' Chapel, which seats not
quite 500, was well filled half an hour
the time set for the ceremony,
rind the guests as they waited viewed a !
â v i of decorations in green and
white. The walls and ceiling of the
chapel were hung in white vines,
wreaths and white flowers, while the
entire altar rail was covered with white
roses.
On the altar were suspended a larg*
number of baskets filled with orchids, i
with a chime of snowy floral wedding
â hells. Large garlands of bride's roses
depended from the bells to two Italian â 
columns, forming a bower which al
most hid from view the bridal party, as j
it stood at the altar. The only music
was that of the organ, which gave out
the notes of the "Lohengrin" wedding
march as the procession entered the i
church doors.
At the same time Bishop Potter and]
Dr. Porter, vestured for the service, en
tered the chapel from the vestry, fol
lowed by the Prince and Hon. R. E. '
PRINCE AND PRINCESS CANTACUZENE.
The San Francisco Call.
Palmer, a cousin of the bride, who
acted as best man by proxy for the
Grand Duke "Oyrll of Kussia, who was
unable tp be present.
The bridal procession included only
Miss Grant and her escort and ushers,
as there were no bridesmaids nor any
maid of honor. As the bride's father at
present is with the army In the Philip
pines, her brother, Ulysses B. Grant
111, a member of the third class at
West Point, acted in his place. Mr.
Grant wore the full cadet uniform.
The ushers were: Potter Palmer Jr.,
a cousin of the bride; Lockwood Hon
ore, uncle of the bride; Captain Sar
toris. a member of Fitzhugh Lee's staff j
during the late war, and also a cousin
of the bride; Robert L. Gerry of New-
York. Roger Winthrop of Newport.
John Prer.tiss of New York, Worthing
ton Wbitehouse of New York and
Lathrop Randolph of Boston.
Miss Grant was gowned in white. Her
drees was severely cut, but of the rich
est white satin, with a sweeping train
and veil of tulle. She carried a shower
bouquet of stephanotis and lilies of the
valley and wore the sifts of the bride
groom, a corsage ornament of diamonds
and enamel and rope of pearls.
The Prince, as he stepped down from j
chancel to meet the oride, was at
tired in the full uniform of the Cheva
lier Garde, brilliant with red and gold !
At the chancel they separated, three !
passing to one side and three to the
other, while the Prince stepped down to
meet his bride.
The oral part of the services finished
the organ burst forth with the Men
delssohn wedding march, and th j !
Prince and Princess led the way to the
chapel door, followed by the ushers.
Among the congregation, besides the ,
immediate family, were Mrs. Ulysses
S. Grant, grandmother of the bride; H.
H. Honore, Edwin C. Honore, Mr. and
Mrs. Harry Honore Jr.. Mrs. Sartoris,
wife of Captain Sartoris; Major Gen
eral Nelson A. Miles, Mrs. and Miss
Miles and Lieutenant Colonel Michner j
of General Miles' staff; General Merritt
and Major Mott of his staff. Adjutant
General Corbin, Colonel and Mrs. :
Heinde of West Point, former United j
States Minister Samuel Taylor of Wis
consin, Assistant Secretary of War
Heiklejohn, Chauncey M. Depew and
many others.
The reception at the Potter Palmer
residence was one of the largest ever
held in Newport. The bridal couple |
received under an immense floral arch, l
with Mrs. Grant and Mr. and Mrs. [
Potter Palmer standing on the right,
while seated near was Mrs. D. S. Grant.
The Prince and Princess started Tor {
New York on board the steam yacht j
Narada.

JOHN BULL'S LATEST
WARNING TO THE BOERS
LONDON, Sept. 25.â The officials 01
the Foreign Office this evening gayÂ«
out the text of the letter of the Secre
tary of the State for the Colonies, Mr
Chamberlain, to the British High Com
missioner in South Africa, Sir Alfrec
Miiner. dated September 22. The Brit
ish reply expresses regret that her Ma
jesty's offer number five, of Septembei
9, had been refused, and says:
The abject her Majesty's Government
had in view in the recent negotiations
has been .stated, ln a, manner which can
not admit of misapprehension, viz., to ob
tain such substantial and immediate rep
resentation for the Ultlanders.as will en
able them to secure. for themselves that
fair- and Just treatment which, was : for
mally promised them In ISSI, which hei
Majesty intended to secuie for them
when she granted privileges of self-gov
ernment to the Transvaal. No conditions
less comprehensive than those contained
in the telegram of September 8 can be
relied on to effect this object. The re
fusal of the South African Government
to entertain the offer thus made, com-
Ing as It does after four months of pro
tracted negotiations, themselves the
climax of five years of extended, agita
tion, makes It useless to further pursue
the discussion on the lines hitherto fol
lowed, and the imperial Government is
now compelled to consider the situation
afresh and formulate Its own proposals
for a final settlement of the issues which
have been create. in South Africa by the
policy constantly followed for many
years by the Government of South
Africa. They will communicate the re
sult of their deliberations in a later dis
patch.
In a later communication, dated Sep
tember 22. the imperial Government
takes up the charge of breach of faith
Insinuated by Secretary of State Reitz
September 16, "which we cannot pass
over in silence." Mr. Chamberlain then
says:
The proposals made by the South Afri
can republic in its letters of August 19
and 20 were, not induced by (he suppes-'
tions given by the Uritish agent from the j
State Attorney, as claimed. On the con
trary the State Attorney sounded the
Kritish agent both In writing and in con
versation as to th>< conditions on which '
the Imperial Government would waive the !
tavttanon to a joint Inquiry, and the re- '
suit of these < ommunicatlons was the I
proposals made by the South African !
Government in these letters. It is impos
sible that the South African Government
could hfCve had any doubt as to the im
perial Governments answer to the con
ditions named, and my reply weta actually
the same aa the British agent had fore
shadowed to the State Attorney and
which, therefore, the South African Gov
ernment must have anticipated in making
the proposals.
The imperial Government also denies
that its telegram of September 8 substi
tuted an entirely new proposal for the
invitation to the joint commission of in
quiry.
The imperial Government then
quotes the dispatch from South Africa |
of August 19, containing an alternative
proposal identical with that which the
Boer Family of Sharpshooters.
: imperial Government is said to have
â  substituted, and the communication
| then proceeds as follows: ,'
The imperial ; Government see's no
ground for misapprehension on the part
of the South African republic as to its an
swer regarding non-interference and suze
-1 rainty,' as the imperial Government had
i already stated that it would not press for
! the appointment of a joint commission of
: Inquiry in view of the fact that such an
i inquiry would. in the opinion of the Gov
â¢ ernment of the South African republic,
; prejudice the right of., full Independence
; repeatedly recognized by the imperial
j Government.
â¢ As to the use of the English language
j In the Volksraad, the imperial Govern
j merit regards this as reasonable, and Is
astonished that the Government of the
South African republic should deem it un
necessary, and make a". point of denying

NEW ACCUSERS ARISE
AGAINST DR. TEBBETS
Charged by a Fresno Dentist of
Seeking a Big Bribe.
Scandal Reaches Wide Proportions, and Dr.
Cranz Will File Charges With the
Governor To-Day.
THE scandal in the State Board of
Dental Examiners, in which Dr. F.
F. Tebbets is the central, unenvia
ble, accused figure, has assumed
wide proportions. Another dentist
has come forward to join Dr. Louis
T. Cranz in charging Dr. Tebbets with at
tempted bribery. This new accuser is Dr.
G. H. Gazarian of Fresno, who declares
that Dr. Tebbets demanded of him $300
as the price of a diploma from the State
Board. Dr. Gazarian says that Tebbets
told him that there were four m-mbers
of the board who had to be paid. Ga
zarian refused to give the money and
failed in securing a certificate.
The Governor pan now have no Jurthfer
excuse for delaying or preventing an in
vestigation of the scandal.' Dr. Louis T.
Cranz has become weary of promises and
has determine to press the matter at
once to an issue. He has sought an in
quiry into his accusations against his fel
low member. Dr. F. F. Tebbets, but on
one pretext or another the Dental Ex
aminers and the Governor have evaded
the Issue.
Dr. Cranz has decided therefore to
place responsibility where it belongs, and
to-day his attorney, Thomas D. Riordan,
will draft formal charges and present
them to Governor Gage with a demand
for an immediate and public investiga
tion. Dr. Tebbets must enter therefore
upon a trial in which his professional
honor and his private character are at
stake. And it is extremely probable that
the methods of the entire Board of State
Dental Examiners will be subjected to
the closest scrutiny.
The scandal which revolves around the
name of Dr. Tebbets has opened a wide
field in which accusations of fraud and
dishonesty in the Issuance of certificates
and the sale of examination papers must
be answered. Dr. Cranz specifically ac
cuses Dr. Tebbets of having urged him
to become, party to the sale of a certifi
cate to a Chinese for $1000. The accuser
promises to hav.e the testimony of two
dentists who will swear that they paid
Dr. Tebbets money to assist certain ap
plicants to obtain certificates. Another
dentist will swear that another applicant
Informed him thai he had been ap
proached by Dr. Tebbets, who demanded
$300. The sale of the examination ques
tions to George R. Harris. F. O. Wolf
and Nicholas Connor will also be exploited
far more deeply than the letters already
published indicate.
Nothing will be left undone to give the
Governor every opportunity to make a
thorough investigation if he wishes to do
so. The affair has already scandalized
the dental fraternity far more than the
members of the profession care to see,
and Dr. Cranz will be assisted by his pro
fessional associates to clear the name of
the State board from suspicion.
One of the most remarkable features of
the entire affair is the attitude assumed
by Dr. G. S. Bachman, the president of
the Slate Board of Dental Examiners. As
president of the board Dr. Bachman not
only refuses to call a meeting to discuss
and investigate the charges, but he has
countermanded an order which he made
for a session. The president makes the
startling announcement that he post
poned the meeting which he had already
called sirr.piy because the charges against
Dr. TeDtets had become public property.
When asked Cot an explanation yester
day of his conduct Dr. Bachman was not
only reticent but evasive. He ?a\ s that
he does not intend to call a meeting, pro
poses to make no investigation, and has
no idea who should do so except perhaps
the Governor. When asked if he did not
consider it strange that the State board
preferred to do nothing under such Con
ditions, he replied that it was best to
PKICE FIVE CENTS.
! wait for something to develop and then
| choose a course of action. Directly upon
i this assertion he â  declared that as â â  > a
j matter of necessity there could he no dis
cussion of the affair without a meeting of
J . the board and no such meeting will be
called.
Dr. Bachman admits that a week ago, he
â  authorized the secretary to call a meet
i Ing for October 7 and since then he has
| withdrawn the call because of the charges
i preferred against Dr. Tebbets. The presi
dent declared that he knew nothing more
! cf the charges than what he had read
', in The Call, and he then admitted that on
i Sunday he discussed the accusations w'tn
1 Dr. Cram. The president also asserted
that he had been asked for testimony by
no one, and then he declared that he knew
nothing.
As far as any activity on his part is
concerned he said that there would be no
investigation by the State board. That
i the State board should not rest quietly in
: the face of such serious charges against
| one of its members and suspicions against
| others did not occur to the president in
1 the slightest degree unusual. Dr. Bach
man said that he had not heard of any
j formal charges and did not intend to
I make a demand for any. With that he
j closed the interview.
There is an abundance of testimony to
prove the charges against Tebbets.
Dr. W. Z. King of this city will testify
that Tebbets admitted to him that he
! had been doing crooked work as a mem
ber of the State Board for four or five
years, and that his illicit traffic had
yielded on an average of $500 a year. .
Dr. Metcalf of Sacramento and Dr.
| King will be relied upon to prove that
Tebbets demanded pay for a dental cer
tificate from Dr. G. H. Gazarian of Fres
no, and the latter corroborates their
statement. -'â¢''.>;â¢â¢
Dr. J. L. Asay of the faculty of the Col
lege of Physicians and Surgeons will
swear that he had to pay Tebbets for
! securing a certificate for a young lady
i student.
Dr. L. M. Finnigan of San Jose will give
evidence against the accused to the effect
that .Tebbets demanded and was paid $50
for securing a certificate for Dr. Finni
gun's stepson. ':â ;.â  â¢â¢:.,;.;
This is briefly what will be set forth
|in the formal charges which are being
I prepared for Dr. Cranz by Attorney
Thomas D. Rlordan, and which will be
forwarded to the Governor to-day. No
later than yesterday Dr. Cranz received
! reassurances from Dr. Asay and Dr. Met
! calf that they would be ready to tell
all they knew when called upon to testify.
The Finnigan case is one in which Teb
bets displayed unusual boldness. Finni
gan's stepson was in the midst of the ex
aminations when Tebbcts approached
Finnigan with the statement that the
stepson was a little deficient in some
branches; that a certain member of
the board objected to giving him a cer
tificate, but that for $50 he could "fix"
the objecting member. Finnigan paid $25
on account and in due course of time
the stepson received his credentials. A
short time afterward Tebbets sent a let
ter to Finnigan requesting him to pay up
the balance due. â¢â 
A somewhat similar case is that of Dr.
Asay. A young lady dental student who
â  studied under him went before the State
I Board for a certificate. She was un
usually bright and passed a most credit
able examination. No one thought that
there would be any question of her pass
ing, and Dr. Asay was astounded when
Tebbets called upon him and imparted
the Information that several members of

Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Sept. 25.â A dispatch was
received here to-day from Ortiz, state
of Sonora, Mexico, giving late and au
thentic information concerning the
situation in the Yaqui Indian country,
just east of there.
Lieutenant Miguel Mojeron, who is
on the staff of Colonel Juan Hernandez,
has just arrived at Torres on his way
to the City of Mexico to deliver import
ant papers and reports on the cam
paign to General Berrizabol, Secretary
of War.
Lieutenant Mojeron states that there
has been no cessation in the movement
against the Indians on the part of the
Government troops, and that it is the
opinion in military circles that the
campaign will continue to be pushed
vigorously. The large force of Indians
which was located near Torrin has di
vided into many small bands, and they
have begun a guerrilla warfare. The
Indians evade making a determined
stand against the troops, but they
harass them from secure positions in
the mountains and along the rough
roads whenever opportunity offers.
Colonel Hernandez has adopted the
tactics of the Indians to a large extent,
and he has a number of scouting par- j
ties looking for bands of Indians. Skir- !
mishes between these small opposing'
forces occur daily, but the- casualties â¢
are small. It is reported that General j
Luis Torres has urgently recommended
to the War Department that a large j
force of rurales be sent to aid in the
campaign. The rurales are natural
born mountain fighters, and are held I
in great dread by the Yaqul Indians.
There has been a great exodus of
American gold prospectors from the
hostile country during the past few
weeks. The majority of these pros
pectors made their egress through Or
tiz. They nearly all brought out tales
of murder and arson that had been
committed by the Indians. A number i
of these . prospectors were forced to |
abandon paying gold placer claims, and
there is little prospect that they will
be able to re-enter the region and re- j
sume thoir mining operations.
Thomas; G. Joureck, formerly of
Butte, Mont., is one of the prospectors
who had to flee from his mining claim
when he had a fortune in sight. He
estimates that he had not less than I
$40,000 of gold on hand when a band
of Yaquis in war paint began shooting
at him from the opposite side' of the
Yaqui River. He mounted his broncho
and tied toward Ortiz, leaving "nearly
all of his gold washings behind. He is
trying to organize an armed expedition
to go back with him in search for the
won lth : .
MORE ACCUSERS RISE
AGAINST DR. TEBBETS
Continued from First Pace.
the board were opposed to granting cer- |
tiflcaten to women. Tebbets feigned sor- j
row for the young lady's plight and out
of the goodness of his heart suggested
that he might be able to "fix" the mat
ter for a certain sum. The money was
paid and the certificate was Issued.
When the impending scandal was known i
only within the Inner circle of the Dental
Examiners Dr. Moore of Benicia, who is
secretary of the board, wrote to Dr. Cranz
that whenever he said the word he j
(Moore) was in a position to force Teb
beta to resign. Later Cranz received a
letter from Dr. Metcalf. urging him. in i
view of the evidence he had in his pos
session, to taJce immediate action against i
Tebbets.
Desiring to prevent the scandalizing of
the profession, Cranz sent the Metcalf
letter to Moore, reminded him of his as
sertion of his power to force a resignation
from the accused and requested him, for
thÂ» good of the fraternity, to make Teb
beta step out. Dr. Cranz has never re- j
ceived an answer to the letter and Tebbets |
is still a member of the board.
It appears that at the time George R.
Harris decided to try for a certificate
from the State Board he was not aware
that the key of. the whole situation was
for sale. No one had intimated to him
that the list of questions could be pur
chased from members of the board until
after he had taken the examination In !
anatomy and failed to pass. This exami- ;
nation occurred in the morning, and be
fore the afternoon, it is stated on good !
authority. Harris was told by Dr. J. S j
Knowlton that there was an easier way
to Kft a certificate than to burn the mid- {
night oil studying books on dentistry. For
n consideration of $25 Knowlton is said to
have promised to produce the list of ques
tions. Harris did not have the ready
money, and pawned his ring to raise the
wind that promised to blow a dental cer
tificate in his direction.
The scheme was so promising that Har
ris let a couple of fellow-students named
Nicholas Connor and Fred O. Wolf in on ,
the secret. The story goes that he agreed
to let them have the use of the questions j
which he had contracted for with Know!- >
ton. Knowlton bad previously Informed
Harris that Tebbets was the man who had j
such sreat compassion on the struggling
students In dentistry as to give them the â¢
list of examination questions for a con
sideration.
In some way the fact tfiat Harris was
going to share his information witn h;*
friends reached the ears of the dealers
in State Board favors, and Harris was in- |
formed that the price of questions had
gone up. The demand was made for $75.
Wolf and Connor were called into con- j
sultation. and between the trio the neces- j
MTy amount was raised. This was handed
to Knowlton and in the course of a little
time he delivered the goods.
The three men studied the questions ann
prepared their answers In the office of
Dr. E. J. Treyer, room 7, Phelan building, j
where Harris is now practicing. They
carefully avoided a similarity in their
style of answers and when they went to j
complete their examinations they were ,
satisfied that all they had to do was to !
wait and have their certificates handed i
them.
Things did not come their way. While
they were waiting for the glad tidings ot i
their success they received the sorrowful |
news that they would have to try againâ
that they had fallen by the wayside In
answering some of the questions. Harris
at once Jumped at the conclusion that he
bad been bunkoed and snorted around like

a madman. Knowlton was sent for post- i
haste. The doctor evidently knew what
was coming, for when he appeared in
Harris' office he had the .$75 in his j out- j
stretched hand and before' a Word was
passed. between them he hud "paid back
the money. .
"It was hot my fault,"* he said. "I did
all that 1 could and cannot understand
why you failed to pass."'
'â  Harris at once, took his ring out of :
pawn. To friends he stated that he had !
no kick com ing. and would not squeal on .
the men" who had" attempted to bunko him,
because they had returned his money. ,
Tic only thing for which he expressed re- ;
gret was the fact that he had put up 'JlO i
for the privilege of taking the examina- :
tions and that was gone beyond recall.
The examination papers which were
furnished to the men by Tebbets through
the agency of Knowlton passed into the i
hands of Wolf. -He has stated' to his
friends that he is holding them as a club j
over Tebbets' head to force him to be real
good, without pay, when the next ex- |
aminations come along.
Dr. J. S. Knowlton, who is accused of !
having acted as a go between in sale of â 
dental examination questions, was brief, i
but not to the point, when interviewed j
yesterday. He knows Dr. Tebbets well !
and was formerly in the same office with
George R. Harris, whose letters show that :
he was once seeking the coveted ques
tions. Dr. Knowlton is now an instructor
In mechanical dentistry in the College of I
Physicians and Surgeons, having sue- j
ceeded Major Boxton to that position.
"I positively decline to talk about this
matter," said Dr. Knowlton yesterday af- j
ternoon, "except to say that George R.
Harris Is a treacherous fellow, whose j
friend I made the mistake to be. He says !
that I can't be believed under oath. WeH, â 
I will go on the witness stand, If I am
called, and swear ' at It. is all a lie. That j
is all I have to say and I don't want \
to be bothered." â ' .-Â«
Further than that Dr. Knowlton would i
have nothing to say. He was very cvi- .
dently disturbed.
In connection with Harris' failure to
pass the examinations after receiving the
set of questions from Tebbets, a story is
told which implicates in a measure Dr. |
Metcalf of Sacramento and Dr. Thomas 'â¢
Morffew of this city. It Is stated that
some time before the examinations Dr.
Morffi-w sent a man to Harris with the
request that the latter allow him to study
mechanical dentistry in his laboratory
and perfect himself in , the profession
under the doctor's instructions. Harris
refused to accommodate the friend of Dr.
Morffew and a coolness sprang up â¢ be
tween them. Harris told an acquaintance
that Dr. Metcalf of Sacramento informed
him . that it was useless for him --to at
tempt to get a diploma from the State
board for the reason that he was doomed
for refusing to accommodate Dr. Morffey'

EVIDENCE ACCUMULATES.
Tebbets Wanted a Poor Arme
nian to Borrow Money to
Bribe Him.
FRESNO, Sept. 25.â Dr. G. H. Gazarian j
of the firm of Cook & Gazarian, dentists i
of this city, claims that he is one of the
victims of the wholesale bribery practice
charged against Dr. F. F. Tebbets of the
State Board of Dental Examiners. Ac
cording to Gazarlan's story he is a victim, i
not because he was fleeced out of $300, but â¢
because the board refused to issue him a
diploma after he had passed the examina
tion but had refused to pungle.
Gazarian is an Armenian and speaks i
English with difficulty, but he is reputed j
to be one of. the best practicing dentists j
in Fresno, notwithstanding he hae never j
been granted a diploma. He has appeared i
before the State Board of Dental Ex- j
aminers three times and has taken the j
examinations twice, the last time in
August of this year when, according to
his story. Dr. F. F. Tebbets made over
tures to him.
In August, Ifi9B, Gazarian decided to
take the examinations and went before
the State board, but failed on account of
his Inability to speak fluently the English
language.
"1 was about to leave San Francisco In
disgust," said the doctor to a corre
spondent of The Call to-night, "but met a
young, friend at the depot who told me
not to be discouraged; that he was sure
if I came next year he could arrange it
so that I would pass. I thanked him and
told him that I would. Before I left he i
said I had gone at the thing in the wrong
way: that what I needed was not to study
English and dentistry but to get an In
fluential friend on the Board of Ex
aminers. I told him I didn't know any of

SQUAW SUES
FOR DIVORCE

Romance in the Life of
Millionaire Hite.

SDPclal Dispatch to The Call.
MARIFOSA. Sept. 25.â Before Superior
Judge Joseph P. Jones this morning m
commenced the trial of the sensation*] \
divorce suit, Hlte vs. Hite. The plaintiff
is a full-blooded squaw of the Digger In
dian tribe, and she tharges her husband
with desertion. Her story is indeed ro
mantic and savors more of a novel than
the recital of the woes of a poor, deserted
Indian woman.
John K. Hite. the defendant. Is a mil
lionaire mine owner, and the dark-hued
plaintiff alleges that many years ago, |
when he was out a poor prospector, his i
life was saved by her sister, who subse
ciuently died. Hite had been lost in a
snowstorm, the complaint sets forth, and :
th<Migh Dearly frozen to death, was nursed
back to life by the squaw. After she died j
Hite remained at the wigwam and took I
to be his wife the complainant, Lucy. For
several years, she alleges, they lived to
gether as husband and wife, Hite follow
ing his vocation as miner. He grew rtch
and finally tired of his squaw wife. Sub
sequently he married a widow. Mrs. Ce
celia Nougues. The Indian woman now
has commenced an action for absolute di
vorce and asks for her share of Hlte's
millions.
The defendant denies the principal al
legations of the suit. He declares that
hÂ» never went through any form of mar
riage with the Indian woman nor did he '
ever acknowledge her as his wife.
At the trial this morning nothing was
accomplished beyond the swearing in of a
panel of jurors.

the members and was a stranger in San
Francisco. He said, 'Oh, that doesn't
matter-; go to a member of the board and
pay him something and it will be all
right.'
"I thought the matter over and wont
back to San Francisco last August to try
the examinations again. I didn't like the
money suggestion and did nothing toward
getting an influential friend on the board.
My young friend had promised to do that
a lid I trusted that he would help me If
he could.
"On the second day of the examina
tions I was leaving the room In which
the questions are submitted to the appli
cants and happened to pass the door of
Dr. Tebbets' office. The door was open
and the doctor was sitting in a chair.
He hailed me, saying: "Hello, Gazarian;
I am glad to see you and I hope you
will pass this time. Come in; I want to
tell you something."
"I wont into the office and he asked me
how many times I had tried the exami
nations. I told him I had been before
the board three times, counting that one.
He asked me if I had seen a certain
young man at the depot as I was about
to leave San Francisco the year before.
I told him that I had and that I had
seen the young man again since I got
hack to San Francisco that time. He
asked me what the young man had told
me. I explained that he had advised me
to get an influential friend on the board.
" 'Well, did you get the Influential
friend?' he askeu.
"I told him that I did not; that every
body was a stranger to me. 'Would you
like to pass this time?' he asked. I told
him I would, and he said, 'Well, I am
your friend; I'll help you.'
"I did not see him again until the next
day. It was the day the soldiers came
in and he was on his way down to the
ferry depot, accompanied by his secre
tary. I met him and he said: 'Come, doc
tor; let us go see the soldiers.' I walked
down the street with nlm and pretty soon
the secretary left us.
"At Market and Fourth streets Tebbets
invited me into a neighboring saloon to
have a drink. I drank soda and he took
whisky. He mentioned the conversation
had with me the day before and asked
me what I thought of it. I told him I
thought he was my friend. He asked me
how much I thought he ought to get. I
told him I had no money and could not
afford to pay much. He suggested that a
diploma ought to be worth $300 to me. I
refused to pay it. saying I didn't have the
money. He said he would be easier on
mo but that there were four members of
the board and that when the $300 was di-
vided up It would leave them only $75
each.
"I still persisted that I was not able to
i>.'.y the moaey. Then he wanted $20. but
I told him 1 did not have even that. He
wanted to tenon if I couldn't Ret some
friends to so security for me and finally
asked me to mortgage my Fresno ranch,
but I refused.
"Next ilay we wont back to the exam
ination room and the secretary read aioud
the Dames of those who had passed the
written examination. My name was on
the list of the successful ones. We still
had to take the practical examination.
"On the day following 1 again met Teb
bets and he asked me what I was going
to do. I told him I had no money. He
repeated that I might give him security
for the amount, but I refused. Â»
" "Well, you'll never pass,' said he, and
that was the last I saw of him. When the
list of successful candidates in the prac
tical-examination was read my name was
not among them. I thought of going to
Sacramento to lay the matter before the
authorities, but finally gave it up in dis
gust and came home. I will cease prac
ticing before I take another examina
tion."
FLOODS SWEEP THE
LOWER HIMALAYAS
CALCUTTA. Sppt. 25.â Earthquakes,
floods and terrible landslides occurred
at and near Darjeeling, in the lower
Himalayas, last night. Great damage
i was dune and no fewer than sixty na
tives perished.
There was a rainfall of twenty-eight
inches in thirty-eight hours. Three
bad landslides took place between Dar
jeeling and Sonada, involving the
transshipment of a railway train of
passengers.
According to the latest reports nine
European children and twenty natives
were lost between those two points.
The whole Calcutta road is blocked.
About a thousand acres of tea have
bees destroyed from Jalapahar to
Burchill. At the latter place some three
thousand feet of water supply pipe
have been ruined. The electric plant
has suffered seriously and the town is
in darkness. There is great fear of
further rain.
A dispatch from Jalpaiguri, on the
river Teesta, forty miles southeast of
Darjeeling, says that a boat crossing
the Teesta with three Europeans and
six natives was swamped by the high
waves. The body of one of Its occu
pants has been found fourteen miles
down the river. It is reported that the
Europeans, Anderson. Kuster and
Whitman, jumped overboard. Their
I fate ,is unknown. Search parties have
been sent out to look for them.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 25.â There was
much speculation to-day as to the
probable time of Admiral Dewey's ar
rival off Sandy Hook. In the opinion
of many officers the Olympia will not
be sighted first off Sandy Hook. They
think that in all probability the ad
miral will so time his approach to the
American coast that he will have j
leisure to put into some bay, possibly
Delaware, for the purpose of painting
his ship before proceeding to New
York.
Aboard the flagship it was said that
the Texas had been selected as the ship
to go out to meet Dewey and escort
him into port. No orders were issued
yesterday. Whatever ship is selected
for the service will remain with the
fleet with steam up until the Olympia
is sighted from the highlands of Nave
sink, and she will then steam down the
bay and meet Dewey's llagship out
side.
Among the callers at the Dewey
committee headquarters to-day was
George Goodwin Dewey, the boyish
looking son of the hero of Manila.
Young Dewey said it was his intention
to go down the bay to greet his father
as soon as the Olympia was sighted.
It is the intention of the Choral
Union to go down the bay to greet
Admiral Dewey on Thursday night and
sing him to sleep with patriotic airs.
Governor Roosevelt's intentions re
garding Admiral Dewey are annoying
to the Mayor and to the committee,
who fear that the Governor intends to
call on the admiral in advance of the
Mayor. A representative of the Gov
ernor denied that he would make a call
before the Mayor had done so. but he
admitted that the Governor intended to
put to sea on Thursday morning on
General Francis V. Greene's yacht.
Wild Duck, in order to welcome the
Olympia. The Mayor and the commit
tee regard this as confirming their
fears.
Fifth avenue to-day looked like a
Klondike town in boom time. Hun
dreds of carpenters were hammering,
sawing and chopping just as though it
were a break-neck race to get a hotel,
Baloon and courthouse done before
some other town across the creek made
arrogant pretentions of being the cap
ita! of newly settled country. The
avenue was filled with lumber wagons,
and men in overalls and jumpers had
the right of way. From the Savoy
Hotel to the Fifth Avenue Hotel there
were banks of yellow pine. Every
householder on Fifth avenue seems to
be building a grandstand, either for his
own use or for the accommodation of
a paying public. In many stores tiers
of seats rise behind the big windows of
plate glass, and if the shop is on the
second story there are seats on the out
side as well. To sit behind plate-glass
Is accounted to be worth $10. while a
closer view, with the risk of rain, is
valued at half the sum.
Around the Dewey arch thousands of
1 sightseers lingered to-day watching the
i workmen and marveling at the beauty
I of the arch, which is being gradually
i revealed. It is announced by the arehi-
I tect that there is no doubt the arch
i will be completed in time for the land
parade. The Brooklyn Bridge illumi
i nation is not coming on so well. Owing
to inferior Wiring at least 1000 of the
! globes have fallen off. All the electri-
I cians struck to-night. The contractor
! will have fifty men in their places to
morrow.
Clad in Greek costumes. 200 members
of the Arion and Liederkranz societies
will sing patriotic airs in welcome to
Admiral Dewey in the naval parade on
I Friday, when the flagship Olympia,
i after rounding the stake-boat St. Mary,
comes to anchor just .south of the al
legorical floats, "Peace" and "Victory."
In all the public schools to-day classes
of girls began sewing on caps and capes
which are to form part of the costumes
of the children who take part in the
display feature of the school-children's
welcome to Admiral Dewey.
The reception committee has finally
decided on the order to be taken by
the city officials and the guests of the
city in the land parade on next Satur
day. It is as follows:
Sousa's band.
Battalion of sailors from the Olympia,
Dewey and the Mayor. Dewey's five cap
tains at Manila. Dewey's personal staff,
Rear Admiral Sampson and Randolph
Gnggenhelmer. Admiral Sampson's staff;
Admiral Philip, commandant of the New
York station, and President T. F. Woods
of the Board of Aldermen; staff of Ad
miral Philip. Junior officers of the Olym
pia, junior officers of the North Atlantic
squadron.
That will complete the naval formation.
Then will come the guests of the city in
this order: Visiting Governors not accom
panied by troops. Major General Miles and
aids. Renr Admiral Schley and Rear Ad
miral Miller, joint committee of the
Municipal Assembly, sailors of the North
Atlantic squadron. Following the sailors
will be the soldiers of the regular and
the other military organizations.

N 1NEW BATTLESHIP KEARSARGE
PROVES TO BE VERY SPEEDY
Exceeds Government Requirements at the
SWIFT NEW BATTLESHIP KEARSARGE.
BOSTON, Sept. 25.â The new bat
tleship Kearsarge had her trial
trip to-day. She made an aver
age of 16.845 knots an hour over
the Cape Ann course which cov
ers sixty-six nautical miles. It is pre
sumed that allowances for tide and
other conditions will bring the average
speed to seventeen knots. It is assured
that the Kearsarge will be accepted by
the Government under the contract
which calls for 16 knots over the course
.it ISO revolutions or less. There is no
a premium for exceeding con
;eed.
The Kearsarge got under way dff
Boston Light and headed for the course |

a light southeast wind was blowing.

HOBART MUST QUIT
WORK ALTOGETHER
His- Physician Says His Life De

Rest.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25.â Those who
are acquainted with the character of
Vice President Hobart's illness have
not only given up hope of his being a
} 'residential candidate again, but fear
that he will not be able to preside over
the Senate during the coming session.
He has serious heart trouble and his
physician ha:; stated to friends that his
life can only be prolonged by giving up

of any kind.

boat. She was then turning on 118 rev
olutions to the minute. For about fif
teen miles the warship held her head of
steam steadily, while the revolutions
increased little by little.
The first leg of the course, six and
three-fifths nautical miles, was cover
ed at an average of 17.45 knots ah hour.
The second leg was done in 17.5 knots
on an average. After this the steam
pressure fell down gradually through
out the course, but the engines were as
free in movement as those of first-clase
cruisers. On the outward run of 33
knots she averaged 17.32 knots with a
smooth sea. On return she averaged
16 37 knots against a head
There was a break in the feed water
tubes, which it was estimated resulted m
a loss of three-quarters of a knot. This
was the cause of the steady drop that
was made in the southward course,
which brought the average speed on
the elapsed time below seventeen knots.
The Kearsarge plowed through the

Senate. Senator Frye will doubtless
be chosen by the Senate to preside in
his absence.
HOSPITAL ATTENDANTS
MUST DON UNIFORMS
State Lunacy Commission Issues a
Peremptory Order Regarding
Female Employes.
STOCKTON, Sept. 25.â The female em
ployes of the State Hospital for the In
sane must put on uniforms forthwith. The
local board of managers is understood to
have received a peremptory order from
the State Lunacy Commission to enforce
the order relative to uniforming attend
ants. It will be acted upon by the board
of managers at the next meeting. The in*
formation has not yet been officially com
municated to me attendants, hut they
have been given to understand that uni
forming of attaches has been decided
upon by the commission, and that the
board lias nothing to do but to enforce
the order. No order has yet arrived re
garding- male attaches.
As far as tne attendants and employes
are concerned it means that they must
lit her don the uniforms or give up their
positions, however distasteful or unbe
coming the uniforms may be to them. All
the employes of the State Hospital have
made a bitter fight against the uniforms,
but Secretary Carrere of the Lunacy
Commission, who is said to have been
the instigator of the proposition, has won,
and the uniform will soon be a reality.
EXECUTED FOR HAVING
SHOT AT THE KING
Punishment That Was Meted Out to
the Bosnian Who Attempted
to Murder Milan.
BELGRADE. Servia, Hept. 25.â The
court this morning rendered judgment in
the case of the prisoners who have been
on trial for some time past charged with
the attempted assassination of former
King Milan of Servia July 6, when he was
shot at by a Bosnian named Knezevic.
Knezevic and Puasitch, the leaders of the
conspiracy, were sentenced to death; ten
others were condemned to twenty years'
imprisonment, one to nine years and seven
to five years. Six who were tried were
acquitted.
Knezevic was shot publicly this after
noon in the presence of a large crowd.
In view of the absence of trustworthy
evidence the finding of the tribunal is the
subject of genfraJ condemnation.
After the sentences were read Puasitch
was informed that King- Alexander had
pardoned him.
GUADALOUPE SUFFERS
FROM MANY DISASTERS
Consul Ayme Reports That the Col
ony May Be Forced to Appeal
for Assistance.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 23.â Consul Aymc
reports to the State Department from
(Juadaloupe that the loss of property from
the recent tropical hurricane amounts to
at least $6,000,000. Forty deaths and over
200 seriously wounded are reported from
various parts of the island. The city is
a mass of wreckage, while the harbor
front is lined with the debris of large and
small boats. The Consul says the fruit
crop is a total loss and that famine
threatens the island. He says the series
of misfortunes which the Island has
passed throughâ earthquakes, destructive
fires and a financial crisis â probably will
force the colony to appeal to the outside
world for assistance.

OMAHA, Nebr., Sept. 25.â A special
from Hastings, Nebr., says: Miss Viola
Horlocker, who is now resting under a
$6000 bond on the charge of 'having at
tempted to take the life of Mrs. Charles
F. Morey by sending h<- a box of pois
oned candy on the 11th day of last May,
was arraigned in the District Court late
this afternoon. The defendant appeared
with her sureties, and in open court
they entered into a recognizance In the
sum of $5000 for the appearance of the
defendant at the December term of court.
When Judge F. B. Beall opened the Dis
trict Court at 9 o'clock this morning there
wa.s a small but eager crowd of specta
tors on hand patiently waiting to hear
something about the celebrated case or
to get a glimpse of the accused. She did
not appear, and the case went over until
4 o'clock p. m., at which time the court
room held but a few persons. Dressed in
black Mls.s Viola Horlocker was escorted
into the courtroom by her sister, Miss
Zora. and her brother-in-law, George S.
Hayes. As the party proceeded Miss Viola
leaned heavily upon her sister"s arm un
til =he was comfortably seated. The at
torneys for the defendant went forward
and greeted her with handshakes and
welcome words. When asked how she
was feeling, she replied:
"I'm feeling better to-day, thank you,"
and seated herself. The defendant's sure
ties renewed the bond, and Miss Hor
locker took oath she would appear at
the December term. Shortly Uierrafter
the defendant left the room^and was
driven to her mother's home.
REVOLUTIONISTS NEAR

PONCE, Porto Rico, Sept. 25.â Advices

Victoria, where the next battle will be
fought. People desiring to proceed to
Puerto Cabello, on the Gulf of Triste, are
not allowed to depart. The Government
is very unpopular and very suspicious.
NEW YORK. Sept. 25.â A Sun special
from Caracas says: According to official
reports, the Government troops have won
a great victory near Coro. The revolu
tionary sympathizers say this is absurd,

Castro are massed at Victoria, which is
more than 150 miles distant from Coro.

against injury to thf> water line region
, will be effected by means of a side armor
; belt of a maximum thickness of sixteen
and a half inches, with a mean depth of
seven and a half feet, so disposed in refer-
I ence to the load line that the vessel, with
; 410 tons of coal on board, will have three
i and a half feet of this belt armor abova
I the water, and with 1210 tons of coal on
board will have two feet above the load
line. In addition to the armor belt, coffer
dams filled with compressed, fire-proofed,
American cornplth cellulose will be
worked the entire ieijgth of the vessel in
the region of the water line.
Throughout the vessel the use of wood
is reduced to a minimum, t,he stateroom
bulkheads being made of steel covered
with cork sheathing, and every attention
is given to lighting, heating, draining and
ventilating the vessel in the most ap
proved and efficient manner. All wood
materials of every description were tested
by the electric fire-proofing process.
There is no speed premium for the build-
Ing of the Kearsarge. hut a penalty of
$100,000 a knot would have been imposed
for failure to reach the contract speed of
sixteen knots.
A comparison of the Kearsarge with
any foreign battle-ship built or building
will, in every case, be to the advantage
of the United States ship. The United
States vessel carries heavier guns and
more of them; heavier armor, more wide
ly distributed and protecting more thor
oughly the vitals of the ship and
gun crews. The normal speed of 16
knots will be loss on paper than that of
most foreign battle-ships, but it should be
noted that t. is sp^ed will be obtained
with a very moderate forced draught and
without unduly pushing the engines, so
that it may be expected at any time this
speed can be duplicated, while it is noto
rious that foreign battle-ships never
again approach their trial speeds.
The vessel will be able to carry a full
supply of coalâ l2lo tonsâ with the great
est ease, the bunker space being so am
ple that this quantity may be carried
without trimming or packing. This
amount will be ample for the ordinary
contingencies of cruising, and for service
in time of war along the American coast,
as at cruising speed of 10 knots it will
be sufficient to enable the vessel to steam
r,\-.;r Â»'.'""> mil's, and at in knots nearly
4000 miles, in case the services of the
battle-ship were needed at a distance,
however, temporary provision could be
made by which four or five hundred tons
extra coal could be carried, with corre
sponding increase in the radius of action.
Th-- contract for the Kearsarge was
awarded to the Newport News Shipbuild
ing and Drydock Company in January,
ISÂ»6, at a price of $2,250,000.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Sept. 25.â 1n spite of thelead
ers a general strike to-morrow seems in
evitable. The only union that has not de
cided to join is the Cartmen's Union, but
it is "expected*- that the cartmen will go
with the rest. The strikers are confident
of winning. They say they have with
stood a blockade of thpee months' dura
tion and after that there is nothing to
fear.
A manifesto has been issued by the gen
eral committee calling upon all to help
the movement. The various, laundry es
tablishments are closed and it is impos
sible to get laundry work done â a very
serious matter in Havana.
It is not known how long the strikers
will hold out. They say that even if they
lose they will have struck a blow in the
right direction. The closing of the laun
dry establishments is a veritable godsend
to the dry goods stores, as people are
literally driven to buy extra linen. Senor
Lacoste, the Mayor, is endeavoring to pro
tect some of the laundries with a view to
keeping them in operation, but It-is im
possible to extend this protection to any
thing like an indefinite number.
It is probable' that Havana to-morrow
will be without bread owing to the
bakers' strike. ;

clared, during a discussion on temper
ance, that the people of the churches
of California have the power to wipe
the liquor traffic from the State and
that he exacted a pledge from the con
ference that none wouid vote for a can
didate that will not pledge himself to
repeal laws that are obnoxious to the
people. This address caused the adop
tion of the following resolution:
"We will vote for no man who will
not pledge himself not to repeal the
present local option laws Upon our stat
ute books."
Other resolutions declare the army
canteen to be an unmitigated curse and
that the dilatory methods of the admin
istration with the canteen question are
worthy only of the united condemna
tion of the millions of Christian people
who have called for its suppression.

MANILA, Sept. 25.â English
men, who claim to have been wrecked
in an open boat last July and held
prisoners by. the insurgents at Vigan,
Northern Luzon, entered the American
lines this morning. They brought a
message from General Pantaleon Gar
cia to the effect that fourteen Ameri
cans held prisoners at Tarlac will be
released Wednesday in accordance
with the decree of the insurgent con
gress. They stated that other prison
ers who are ill will be released as soon
I as their physical conditions justify. The
insurgents also sent word that the
cause of the delay in the release of the
prisoners was because the rebels could
not furnish American prisoners with
I suitable clothing.
â¢ The Englishman also brought a mes
sage from Gregorica Gonzaga, the Fili
pino envoy who came through the lines
several months ago to hold a consulta
tion with Otis regarding the settlement
of the rebellion. â¢ Gonzaga, who . was
president of the Filipino commission,
sent word to Colonel Smith of the
Twelfth Infantry at Angeles, that he
had. made most diligent inquiry all. over
Luzon but had been unable to find any
trace of Captain (now Major) Rockefel
ler, Ninth Infantry, who disappeared
in a mysterious manner shortly 'after
the arrival of his regiment at.JManila.
It was stated first that Captain Rocke
feller wandered beyond the American
lines and was taken prisoner. Later on
it was announced that he was alive and
well and held prisoner by the rebels.
The Englishmen say "there are three
other American prisonersâ a sergeant
of an unknown regiment, a corporal of
a California regiment and a negro who
offered to accept a commission in the
insurgent army."
Lieutenant Gillmore and men, ac
cording to the Englishmen, are still at
Vigan, but will be released later on.
Gillmore and the sailors receive 20 cents
per day. Five Japanese army officers,
j according to the story told by the Eng
lishmen, are assisting, the insurgents
in the north. Crops are plentiful and
the army enthusiastic, but the organi
zation is poor and discipline slack. It
is believed the rebels will retreat to the
mountains when the Americans ad
vance, as they fear cavalry particu

The railroad will have to be used

CAPTURED GUNBOAT
A VERY SMALL VESSEL
â WASHINGTON, Sept. 25.â The grunboat
Urdaneta, which was captured with her
crew at Orani, about twenty-five miles
from Manila on the Bay of Manila, is a
little craft of only forty tons displace
ment, not much larger than a small tug.
She was captured by the navy early in
the war and has been on police duty in
the bay for months past. The records of
the Navy Department show that she was
one of the boats of which the Oregon is
the parent ship â that is, she was sup
posed to draw all of her supplies from
the battleship, to be manned from the
Oregon's crew and to act under the in
structions of the Oregon's commander.
According to the last reports to the de
partment, the little boat was last May
under the command of Naval Cadet Wel
born C. Wood, but the personnel of the
crew is not a matter of record, being sub

FARMER STUNG TO
DEATH BY BEES
Fumes of Sulphur Eoraged the
Insects and They Swarmed
Over His Body.
ALLIANCE, Ohio, Sept. 25.â John Carson, a farmer, aged 65, of
Newton Falls, was stung to death to-day by bees. Carson desired to
work in his apiary, and to quiet the bees burned sulphur. This only
enraged the bees, however, and they swarmed over him, stinging him in
hundreds of places. He made his way to the house, where he fell to
the floor. Several hours later he died.

pointed to the Academy from Ore
gon, had passed his academic course and
was performing sea service at the time
of his capture.
Naturally the department officials are
vexed that the difficulties of the negotia
tions looking to the release of Lieuten
ant Gilmore of the Yorktown and his men
should be added to by this last misfor
tune. Still there is no* disposition to un
necessarily curb the junior officers of the
navy who are rendering such gallant ser
vice in the Philippines.
CABLE FROM OTIS
ON CHINESE QUESTION
WASHINGTON. Sept. 25.-Secretary
Root has received a cable message from
General Otis regarding the Chinese situa
tion in the Philippines. He says that the
shipload of 700 can be landed without
serious interference with military opera
tions. General Otis discussed at consider
able length the subject of Chinese in the
Philippine Islands and the dispatch was
referred to the State Department, where
it was made the subject of a conference
between Acting Secretary Hill and the
Chinese minister.

to charter her last week, but her owners
have been notified by their Government

As the charter with this Government has

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. 25.â Students of stock
market cycles have observed that a violent
movement in either direction is certain to over
run itself. Thus the forced liquidation of the
last few weeks has Invited a horde of bear
followers. When the liquidation had spent Its
force the short contracts of the bears were left
uncovered and the demand from that source
â¢worked a sharp rally. In the normal course
of things a period of dullness Â«aÂ» then due
end it arrived on time to-day. With money
still tight no new speculative demand is to be
expected immediately. On the other hand
ppeculative accounts on the long side have
been pretty well shaken out and the bears are
rather chary of making venturesome incursions
Into ground that does not promise large re
turns. But stagnation of demand means de
clining prices, though the progress may be but
Blow. The conviction is not strong that the
process of loan contraction is completed en
tirely. A study of the clearing-house reports
reveals the facts that the surplus is made up
from the holdings of a few clearing-house In
stitutions while the majority of them are still
bÂ»*low their legal reserves. There was a sharp
reminder of this condition the last hour of
trading to-day when call loans were suddenly
narked up to 12 per cent. The quickness with
which they receded. hnwfyT, to 6 per cent
again' gave the higher ny?.? the appearance of
being manipulated. Borrowers sometimes hold
off till late in the day In hopes of getting
better terms and they find offerings largely
curtailed, while their necessities are still un
satisfied. The rate was down to 6'-j per cent
earlier in the day. The flurry In the last hour
caused the most active selling of stock of the
day. Those who reason that the point has been
turned toward easier money conditions found
little In to-day's occurrences to encourage
them.
New York exchange was heavy at prac
tically all .important interior points and ship
ments to the Interior continue. The New York
sub-treasury also continues to absorb funds
from the banks. The large supply of gold
certificates now available, far from Improving
conditions In New York, rather aggravates
them, as it simply facilitates the movement to
the interior. A firmer tone of sterling ex
change precluded hopes of an early fold move
ment. Discounts in Berlin stiffened sharply
and sterling exchange there fell a fraction.
Discounts in London responded with a rise of
a fraction. No marked strength was manifest
in stocks 'at any time during the flay in spite
of the bidding up of Brooklyn Transit and
Leather preferred. The specialties show the
sharpest losses, reaching between 2 and 4
points In a number of instances. In the rail
roads the grangers were most affected, but a
number of other railroad stocks are down as
much as a point.

were a number of firm spots in the market.

Chicago Wheat Market.
$ *
CHICAGO, Sept. 25.â The opening In Wheat
was weak with no especial important trade.
Both local professionals and outsiders were
sellers. In a moderate way and for a short
times prices showed a drooping tendency and
ranged slightly below Saturday's close. ' The
weakness was mainly on account of the decline
at Liverpool, though this was expected to fol
low Saturday's decline here. Receipts at most
Western primary' points were heavy though
they did not reach last year's total. This fact,
however, was lost sight of for the time being.
The narrowness of trade at first rendered the j
market susceptible to trivial factors, but later
cables showed a complete recovery from the
opening decline with a slight advance in some
futures. This was a cue for local traders
and prices Immediately felt the effect of the
increased buying. As the session progressed
trading became much broader and more
general. Heavy buying orders came from the
Southwest, St. Louis sending bullish dispatches
concerning the demand from country millers
and failing supplies. The visible supply, which
was expected to show a heavy Increase, fell
short 01 expectations by a long way, the in
crease being but 400,000 bushels. The gradual
advance in prices brought early sellers into
the market, but little Wheat, was offered lor
sale, the better crowd being apparently timid
about selling in the present condition of the
market and prices were bid up sharply before i
offerings became liberal enough to supply the
demand.' The market finally got well above
calls, and selling against those privileges
checked the advance tor a time, but near the '
close of the session shorts again bid prices j
up sharply and the price was strong to the |
close at top prices. December opened %i& Uc
lower at 72 I -c. It sold at 72 I,Â«e,1 ,Â«e, then advanced
to 73c. A reaction to 72% c was followed by a
steady advance to 73% c, the market closing at
73% c. September closed l%c higher at 74% c.
A feature of the late advance was the
strength of Corn. Nervousness over Septem
ber Corn shorts had considerable influence on
Wheat speculators.
Shorts in September were evidently appre
hensive of a corner and were active bidders
all day. The price reached 33c, where there
was plenty for sale and the advance was
checked. Deferred futures were strong In sym
pathy and good advances were scored all
around. . September closed %c higher at 35c;
December closed %c higher at 80%&
Not much was done in Oats. The market
was easy early following other grain markets,
but later firmed up and closed at a slight ad
vance. Trading was exceedingly narrow all
day and mostly of a scalping order. The cash
demand was only fair. Receipts were 462 cars.
December closed %<fl',{c higher.
Provisions were quiet but steady. The mar
ket showed easiness with grain at the start,
but another good advance in meats at Liver
pool and the better strength of grain markets
resulted in a recovery of the slight declines
and small advances were scored In some pro
ducts. There was a moderate selling of Janu
ary product by packers. At the close January
Pork was 5@7%c higher; January Lard un
changed, and January Ribs 2%@5c higher. .

U^ew York Cotton Mirhet.
NEW YORK, Sept. To-day's develop
ments on the New York Cotton Exchange were
of a sensational nature. As long as two weeks
ago the bull traders asserted that the market
was unjustifiably low, and they began to back
up. their convictions by purchasing in all th?
weaker Intervals. At the opening of last weeK
the opposition of the Liverpool market and
the European cotton trade in general was
added to that of the local bear interest, and a
battle royal began. But day after day he
bull â¢ forces scored | signal -gains until at .ho
close of Saturday a general rise of 40 points
had been recorded. Believing the market to
be In a substantial reaction, shorts looked for
a change of futures to-day. But events proved
that even worse setbacks than previously ex
perienced were to be met with, and the balls
ministered a drubbing long to be remembered.
On the first call prices shot up 11 to 17 points ,
and further Improved during the first hour on
tremendous buying from all quarters, though
notably from the short side. March was car
ried to $6 74. a rise of 53 points since the up
ward movement was begun. The bear forces
were In utter rout and the greatest excitement
prevailed. Though there were relapses later
under wild spurts of profit-taking, the market
showed Inherent strength and wonderful re
cuperative ability. Sensational rumors were
circulated to the effect that the Liverpool mar
ket had broken away â  from the bear clique,
which has dominated it for months. Public
advices seemed to bear out these stories, as
did an influx of large buying orders from
Manchester and other spinning centers of Eu
rope. Reduced crop estimates, gloomy crop t
testimony, active and higher spot markets in j
the South and talk of smaller receipts from j
now on In the Interior belt were Influences in
the local market to-day. Speculation as a
whole exceeded any single day's business for
many months.

NIGHT AUDIENCE
GREETS MODJESKA
The Star in the Role of
Marie Antoinette.
"MARTHA" A HIT AT THE TIVOLI
"The Drum Major's Daughter" Re
peated at the Grand â Originality
and Variety in Vaude
ville.
Â«
Poor Marie Antoinette's cry "When
â will the people bo ured of my sufferings? "
seems to carry down t*he century, for a
large audience gathered at the Columbia
Theater last night to live over again her
sorrows and to welcome Madame. Mod
jeska.
The play, from the pen of Clinton
Stuart, pictures the most eventful years
in the lives of Louis and his Queen and is
in five acts and a prologue. There is a
touch and go of suggestion in the early
scenes painting the French court in its
frivolity and extravagance, and then
the action glides rapidly from
tho pastoral into tho tragic and
awful that filled the Reign of
Terror with its never-to-be-forgotten hor
lors It is not a great play, for though
It tehs the story, too much of it perhaps,
It is pulselessâ bloodless and does not
carry the conviction its scenes are meant
to hold. It is too full of unreal soliloquy
ana too loose in construction. That was
a terrible situation In reality when the
mob demanded the presence of - the
Austrian woman at the palace window,
but in the drama no one, either on the
stage or in the audience, seemed to fee*
its awfulnes3 tho emotions were none too
deeply stirred.
The play strengthens as It advances,
and whenever Modjeska has tha opportu
nity of good dialogue she shows herself
a true daughter of the Caesars, No one
has ever accused Louis XVI of being a
kingly figure, but Mr. Kellafd was even
less so than the situation demanded. He
had some moments of true feeling, but
they were brief, and his general bearing
â was theatrical. A rather clever child
played the Dauphin, but she hod far too
much to do. She seemed often an intru
sion and deprived tho scenes of weight !
and true pathos by sounding the false
note Inevitable with the stage child. Miss
Mary Hall was stirring as the leader of
the mob; Kate DaigleiÃD a sweet, pathetic
Klizabeth; Irving Brooks an excellent
Simon, and the part of Mirabeau was
cleverly handled by Wadsworth Harris.
The minor support was adequate but not
exceptional.
The scenery is beautiful and the stage
setting closely follows history; in fact the
play is hardly worthy its elaborate and
costly production. The costumes are most
picturesque, especially those worn by
Modjeska. In the Trianon she might have
been fresh from the hands of Greuze, so
closely did she follow the fashion he set.
She is at all times the artist, and even
with the weight of a badly constructed
play she won frequent applause and sev
eral curtain calls for her dramatic skill.
CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
~Tivoli.
The performance of "Martha" at the
Tivoll last evening was a striking ilus
tration of the fact that, after all. the old
ear-tickling operas are never tiresome.
There is some fascination in those dear
old melodies which sound so familiar and
to which you may keep time with a nod
of your head or a tap of your foot. There
is vim and dash throughout the play, and
It is quite breezy after the heavy "music
of "Othello" and "Lohengrin"; some
thing like a black coffee after a heavy i
dinner.
"Martha" introduced the Tivoli's new i
tenor," Thomas Greene, who halls from ;
New York, where he earned laurels with
the Castle-square Opera Company. He j
has a fresh, agreeable voice particularly
adapted to the lighter operatic works,
and will prove the bes,t tenor the Tivoll
has ever had for comic operas. He made
a decided hit last evening, and several of
his solos were enthusiastically encored.
Having an attractive stage presence and
a bright interpretation he will not fail to
become a great favorite. Mr. Greene's
natural tenor will amply make up for any
lack in method he may have.
While Misa Ada Palmer Walker's so
prano is very steely and hard, it is well
trained as far as technical character is
concerned; and inasmuch as Martha is
a colorature part, she succeeded well in
giving a creditable performance of the
role. Mary Linck, aided by her fully de
veloped histrionic accomplishments, was
very successful in her impersonation of
Nancy. Her solo in the fourth act re
ceived a sincere encore. Her vivacity and
dash wa; really refreshing. William
Schuster was in his element as Plunket.
It is exactly in parts like this one where
Mr. Schuster's voice predominates. There
Is a breadth to it at times which is very
artistic and pleasant. "Martha" will al
ternate with "Othello" this week, and
next week the comic opera season will
commence with "Mikado." The manage
ment decided to alternate for an Indef
inite time comic opera with grand opera,

well acted, as such a strong drama should
be. There is an abundance of striking
situations and there are many melodra

and draw tears from eyes that have be

footlights. The important characters are
few but strongly marked, Charles King,

Mr. Ormonde, who has the ungrateful
role Of a thoroughly desultory and pur

-Mr. Bryant's Simeon Slrong was faith
fully acted, while Mr. Montaine furnished
tho humor from the male side of the com
pany. Gertrude Poster, ns Harding's de
voted Wife, had ample opportunity to dis
play her power as an emotional actress,
and she made th,. most of it. The fact
that the applause that greeted her ef
forts was silent and lachrymose and
spoiled handkerchiefs, instead of dim
ming, as dampness usually does, bright
ened her success. In the rolÂ» of Kate
Merriweather, Miss Helen Henry was as
pii|"^nt as ever. Miss Tlarie Howe Was
a charming mothef and Miss Juliet Cros
by a bewitcbingly llirtatious widow. The
play was a success, and last night's per

NORTH BEACH CITIZENS
CONDEMN CHIEF LEES
OPPOSERS OF THE NYMPHIA
HOLD A MASS MEETING.
Sharp Language Used by Attorney
John J. Barrett, Father Caraher
and Others â An Exciting
Session.
If there is any efficacy in an old saying
the ears of Chief of Police Lees must have
caused him some discomfort last night,
because enough unkind things were said
or him at the mass-meeting held by the
citizens of North Beach to cause his hear- j
ing appendages to burn. Not only was his
veracity questioned, but he was charged
with rudeness and dereliction of duty.
The meeting was held in Apollo Hall, i
within a half block of the notorious Hotel |
Nymphia. under the auspices of the
clergymen who have fought for its sup
pression. Rev. Dr. Urmy of the First
Methodist Church called the weli
attended meeting to order. On the plat
form were Rev. Father T. Caraher, Rev.
Father B. C. Redahan, Rev. William
Hours of St. Peter's Episcopal Church,
Rev. Dr. Slocum, Rev. Father McDonald
and others. , â ' ,
Dr. Urmy made a short opening address
in which he condemned the hotel, and
then introduced John J. Barrett, the
young attorney who has covered himself
with honors In achieving a victory against
heavy odds. At the outset Mr. Barrett
explained the progress of the suit, com
mented on the splendid jury and the im
partiality and courage of Judge Graham,
in whose court the cause was heard. In
part he said:
Chief LeeK told me if I secured a resolution
from the Board of Supervisors declaring the
Nymphia a house of prostitution and con
demning: it as a nuisance, he would close It.
When I got thnt, he Bald the resolution was
not sufficient authority for him under the de
cision of Judge Bahra In the turntable case. I
then consulted him as to what was liÂ»9t to do
in the matter. He told ua to prosecute the
principals and he detailed us two splendid of
ficers who gay* us Rood service and aided us
in convicting the landlords, S. P. Blumenberg,
Emll and Valentine 11. Kehrleln and L. B. I*.
Frey. I then requested Chief I.Â«eB to close
vp the Blace and he again said he had no
authority, much to my surprise, because I
understood all along that if we secured their
conviction he would take steps to close It.
I consulted with him from 10 o'clock this
morning until 2 o'clock this afternoon, and I
asked him to do several tilings. In the first
place, I wanted him to close the place and he
answered he had no authority. I next asked
htm to put some officers there and order them
to arrest every woman who attempted to carry I
on business there and to subpoena every man
who attempted to enter. He again replied he
would not do that, but he was willing to have
Lillian Dale prosecuted. ,
I told him that not only wouM I not assist
in her prosecution but I would actively oppose
it on the {ground that it was â  mere subter- j
fuge, because he himself had told me that it !
was futile to prosecute a woman for running j
a house of prostitution, because, a conviction j
could not be obtained against her because of
public sympathy. I consulted two attorney j |
that he had named and they both said he ought '
to close the place, as the very worst thing that
could happen would he nn Injunction and that
would be an easy way to test the matter.
' The man who stands between the sanctity of |
your homes and the virtue of your children,
I don't, caro who he Is. deserves to have, his
name inscribed on the portals of the building,
that it la dedicated to his authority and he !
ought to be ' given as a badge of honor a !
"twinkling Â«tar."
Throughout Mr. Barrett's strong speech
his auditors accorded him close attention
and applause, and when ho concluded he
was ?iven hearty approval. Father
Cflrtther followed, and when that famous '
priest, who has practically been the lend- i
er in the crusade against the resort, i
stepped forward to speak, he was given j
an ovation. After thanking his auditors
for their approval of his conduct, he pro- â 
ceeded to thank the jury for its verdict I
ajfatntft the loathsome, sickening Nym- i
phia; to the learned and honorable- Judge
Graham, who is an honor to the district I
and 'ho Republican party, nnrt who de- j
pcrved advancement to a higher position; i
to Attorney Barrett for his solenoid serv- '
ices and lastly to the. press for its aid.
In part he said:
Now, gentlemen, what la the object of this !
meeting to-night? We have come together to I
take decisive steps to close this den of infamy.
We will nrepo the matter and pn?M it to the
bitter end. We called on Chief Lees last Fri- :
day, a c we had a right and power bo to do. I
We represented four clergymen and he knew
of our eomlnsr. and yet never In my life have
I seen such dlseourtery, such an exhibition of
low breeding, as was displayed by him. In
stead of studying the law Chief Lees should
read a few paces of Chepterfield. , ,
"Lot us stand together as or.o man, 1 '
he concluded. "Let there be no
Protestant or Catholic, Jew or Gen
tile, I,et there be no religious
creed in this movement. There shall be
no faltering on my port. I will never lay
down my arms until the Nymphia and
every foul den In the neighborhood is
closed beyond the possibility of reopen
ing." I
Michnel Thornton, a citizen, moved that !
a committee appointed to call on the
Mayor and Police Commissioners and re- I
quest that the placo be closed. After the
meeting P. J. Buckley. James Kitterman. |
George Oliva, W. A. Simmons and Hen- i
ry Glmmel wore appointed as such. Rev.
Dr. Boura. Father Redhan. Dr. Slocum
and Father McDonald also delivered
speeches condemning the Nymphia in no I
uncertain terms.
THE SAN FR^ CISCO CALL., TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1399.
STREET LIGHTS
A NECESSITY TO
PUBLIC SAFETY
Danger Lurks in the
Shadows.
GAS COMPANY DEMANDS PAY
Appropriation Recommended by Phe
lan and Incorporated in Levy
May Cause Monthly Rep
etition of Trouble.
â¢
No money, no lights, the ultimatum
of the Gas and Electric Company â â¢which
was served on the city fathers a week
ago, Is being carried into effect with a
vengeance. For four nights the citizens
of San Francisco have been compelled to
grope their uncertain way through the
darkness and fog to their homes while
their wives and children, who from neces
sity or pleasure have ventured out after
nightfall, have been subject to possible
Insult from drunken night owls or to as
sault and robbery by the outcasts from
society who earn a precarious living by
warring on humanity. Now Is the har
| vest time for this latter class, for while
the biuecoated guardians? of the peace are
badly handicapped in the performance of
their duties by the murky Â«. darkness of
I the streets the thugs and thieves are at
j liberty to carry on their nefarious busi
ness almost with impunity. Already the
question is being asked by the anxious
| householders and taxpayers of the city,
I "How long will this condition prevail?"
I The pas company officials say they can
' not afford and do not propose to illum
inate the city's streets gratis, and the I
[ hands of the Auditor, the Treasurer and
i the Board of Supervisors are tied as mat
ters now stand. They have no money at
their command to pay for the lighting of
the city, and consequently the streets
must remain in darkness during the re
maining six nights of the present month.
But that Is not the worst phase of the
situation. Not only will there be no II
! lumination of the streets until the Ist of
October, but with the scant appropriation
for that purpose provided in the tax levy !
for the ensuing fiscal year, the citizens of !
San Francisco must look forward to seven
or eight nights of blind groping in every
one of the next. twelve months, unless the j
number of lights throughout the city is
materially reduced or a compromise ef
, fected with the obdurate gas and electric
company, neither of which remedies is
either feasible or advisable.
The appropriation for light the
, streets of San Francisco for the fiscal
year of 1898-1899 was $350,000, making the
sum available monthly under the one
twelfth act something over $29,000. This
year, at the suggestion of Mayor Phelan,
the appropriation was reduced to |240,000
for the year, or $20,000 for each month.
That is the amount allowed by the tax
levy, and it cannot be increased or re
duced. Mayor Phelan figured that this
sum would be sufficient for the proper
lighting of the city, provided the lights
were turned off for the two nights pre
ceding and the two nights succeeding the
full moon and the night of the full moon,
in all live nights each month. With the
$350,000 appropriation the city was enabled
to pay for lighting the streets twenty
four and four-tenths nights per month. ,
Under the rate established by the new tax
levy the number is reduced to twenty
three nights per month, which will leave
the city in total darkness seven or eight
nights every month in the year. To de
crease the number of dark nights even by
one each month will necessitate the cut
ting off absolutely of 312 lights.
These are the facts, the figures being
furnished by the gas inspector, and the
question that now confronts the city au
thorities is, "What are you going to
do about it?" Something must be done
and that at once.. It has been suggested
that the 312 lights be eliminated from the
great Mission district, but if that were
to be seriously considered for a minute
the residents of that quarter of the city
would raise a protest that would shake
i the City Hall to its foundations. But
1 even were the suggestion followed it
would but do away with but one dark
night in each month, as stated.
It is to use a slang expression, "up to
the Mayor." Mr. Phfeldn will be expected
to provide a remedy for the present un
sptisfactory, inconvenient and truly j
' alarming situation. It was at his behest
I that the appropriation was re iuc?d to the
Inadequate sum of $240,000. and as it is !
apparent that the street lighting schedule
outlined by him will not meet the re
quirements, he is looked to to provide a
I more satisfactory substitute. Moreover,
I as Mayor of the city and- the executive
1 her.C of the municipality, it is the plain
> duty of Mr. Phelan to solve the problem
Ihe has created. ' '1. ' : V
The necessity for Immediate action is
recognized by " all parties, and by none
more so than the city officials. In an ef
-1 fort to reach some satisfactory solution
i of the difficulty a conference has been
I arranged between the Mayor, it repre
sentative of the gas company and a mem
ber of the finance committee of the Board

STRIKE OF THE LATHERS'
UNION IS ADJUSTED
OAKLAND, Sept. 23.â The strike of the
local lathers' union against the boss plas
terers, which was inaugurated on August
13, was adjusted shortly before midnight
to-night by an arbitration committe of the
Alameda County Building Trades Council.
The strike was one of the most import
ant and bitterly fought locally in many a
day and involved four unionsâ the lathers,
journeymen plasterers, hod-carriers and
boss plasterers. On August 13 the lathers
demanded an advance from $1 73 to $2 per
thousand Jaths, to take effect immediately
and on all jobs, both new and unfinished.
The bosses conceded the demand on all
new work, but refused to include in their
concession unfinished jobs. As a result
all save about a dozen lathers Quit work
and the dozen walked out of the tanion.
The journeymen plasterers and hod-car
rters sympathized with the strikers and
the matter was finally laid before an ar
bitration committee of the local Building
Trades Council, which met to-night.
Three delegates from each of the unions
involved were allowed to air their griev
ances and shortly before midnight the
arbitration committee, consisting of S. W,
Getchell J. V. A. Frates, W. M. Baccus,
George intzÃcrald and C. E. Barney, an
nounced its decision as follows:
"That the lathers' union receive those
men that resigned into their union at the
following fated: First class men $3 second
class S** BO third class or bunch hands $1
Initiation tee; ana that said lathers' union
put lath OB jobs figured prior to August
15 at $1 73 per thousand, said job or work
to be completed on Monday. October 9, at
spm nnd that said men who resigned
apply for membership in the lathers
union at the first meeting of said union.
Tho verdict appeared to meet with gen
eral satisfaction. The regular initiation
feÂ© of the lathers is $20, and the rates
quoted nre practically In the nature of
small fines for those who left the' union.

PINNED UNDER AN
OVERTURNED BUGGY
BERKELEY. Sept. 23.â Mr?. L. E. White
at Ward rind ' Fulton streets and her sister.
Miss McGovern, were the victims of a
somewhat parlous runaway near Dwight
way this afternoon. That the accident
did not prove fatal in its consequences
was due to the timely presence of D. J.
Tobin and Rev. Edward F. Case.
The two ladies had just started out in
their carriage from Mrs. White's resi
dence on Fulton street. Two boys, riding
horseback came tearing down the street
at a breakneck speed and the buggy
horse, a spirited animal, took fright and
soon got beyond control. In the confusion
following the carriage upsot and both
ladies were thrown out. Mrs. White fell
to tha road and escaped with a few
bruises. Her companion was not so for
tunate. Miss McGovern was pinned under
the hind wheel, parts of her clothing be
coming twisted in the spokes. The horse
was about to start on its mad rush again,
when D. J. Tobfn and Dr. Case came to
the rescue. They succeeded in extricat
ing Miss Mc'iovern from her dangerous
position and carried her to her home.
It was found upon examination that
while the injuries were serious they gave
no cause for alarm, Miss McGovern suf
fering principally ffom the severe nervous
shock.

MINING ENGINEERS
CONSIDER PROGRESS
The First Day of the California Meeting of
American Institute of Mining En
gineers Was Successful.
THE first day spent by the American
Mining Engineers in this city yes
terday was a quiet and pleasant
one for both guests and hosts. The
party in the special train from the
East arrived early in the forenoon from
the north, and its members then gToomed
and rested themselves at the Palace Ho
tel until the first session of the meeting.
In the banquet hall of the hotel at 2 p. m.
The local committee preserved open
headquarters in two corner suites of the
first floor of the hostelry, and many mem
bers of the California Miners' Association
were on hand to tender every courtesy
that could be shown and to escort mem
ber and the ladies of the party about the
AMUSEMENTS.
Â«A Bit siraky."
A man looks at his trembling hands
and says: " I feel a bit shaky this morn-
ing, and shall need a bracer." His real
need is not nerve stimulant, but nerve
strength. Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery gives strength to the nervous
system. It does not brace up, but builds
up. It i 6 entirely free from alcohol and
from opium, cocaine, and other narcotics
usually found in so-called nerve medi-
cines.
Accept no substitute for " Golden Med-
ical Discovery." It cures.
David Duggins, Esq., of Jones, Ohio Co., Ky.,
writes: "When I began taking ' Dr. Pierce*
Golden Medical Discovery I think I had nervous
or general debility of three years' duration. I
took three bottles of the ' Discovery. During
the time I was taking it ray sleep became more
refreshing and I gained fifteen pounds weight,
mud also gained strength every day."
Free. Dr. Pierces Medical Adviser is
sent free on receipt of stamps to pay cost
of mailing only. Send 21 one -cent
stamps for book bound in paper, or 31
stamps for cloth binding. Address Dr.

Mining Engineers at Their First Session.
city. Vntil the opening of the meeting in
the afternoon there were naturally but
few excursions, and at the first session
there gathered all the visiting members
of the institute. Many of the ladies of the
visiting party were there to hear the pres
ident's annual address and the prelimin
ary announcements. Besides these, many
coast members from outside the city and
State displayed their presence, and the
large local attendance of mining men and
other prominent citizens crowded the hall
to the doors.
Lieutenant Governor J. H. Neft, presi
dent of the California Miners' Associa
tion had been suddenly summoned from
the city, and in his stead Vice President
W. C. Kalston delivered the address of
welcome, which he did in fitting and
forcible style, making in the course of his
remarks some pertinent observations on
the present and future of California's
mining industry.
President Douglas responded with hif,
annual address, which was an interesting
review of the mechanical and metallur
gical progress of the nineteenth century.
"I think that California set the exampie
of automaticlty in metallurgy," he said,
in referring to the gold mill, and then he
declared: "I think that one of the most
Important phases of nineteenth century
progress has been the liberality with
which men not only of science but of
technical skill as well are willing to lend
their experience and transfer their
thoughts to others." Mr. Douglas con
tinued:
We cannot help recognizing that the great
force at work during the latter half 01 this
century has been the use of machinery in
stead of tha use of handpower, and that
we, as an industrial group of the world's
nations, have been the one to have used
most this new [nlnciple in human affairs.
The entire obliteration of local interests
and the concentration of our great enter
prises In certain favorably located centers
haii come naturally. The result of that has
been, of necessity, the cheapening to the
world at large of the commodilieÃ, but like
wise an Injury to the individual. What has
taken place ac home its taking place no leas
abroad.
I think we may conclude that if we are
going to maintain our present prominence
we must not count upon our mere natural
reÃourcss, but must bring that same wit
and wisdom to bear upon our industries
that we have displayed In the past; and
that in the twentieth century, upon which
we are so soon entering, the nation will
not rise in the scale bo much by possession
of natural resources as it will by ltn pos
session of mental gifts. Of course, ttret
and foremost stands â  machinery. That
seems to represent, as it were, the genius
of the American people.
1 will draw attention to another factor
in our industrial life which you in the
Vest will appreciate better than men in the
East, and that is our freedom from the
thralldom of the schools. Education is an
admirable thing. Yet education may make
us so bigotedly subservient to what ha.s
been taught us that It dwarfs the lmagina
j tlve faculty and the spirit of invention, ifi
the West, whether we look at our mines
or our Â»meltlng works, we cannot help
feeling that we have progressed very
largely through our ignnrance. Van Cotter
end all the books define everything beau
tifully. The law of 1X72, which was framed
upon the books, laid down mineral deposits
arranged aa regularly as the lines upon a
chessboard. And if we had followed the
text books and followed the law of 1872,
our prospectors who pitched in and deveN
oped all kinds of deposits would never
have opened up the mines of the West.
The twentieth century will see a race
again between the Old World and the New
World forâ l will not say supremacy, but
for prominrncf in all the Industrial arts.
And we will hold our own, not by the pos
session of natural resources, but as I have
already said, by the possession of that mar
velous mother wit which we have already
brought to bear on what we have done lri
tha nineteenth century. (Applause.)
The annual address will soon be pud
llehed in full along with the other pa
pers read at the meeting, and will remain
a valuable feature of the. voluminous
transactions of the society.
The first technical paper of the meeting

Recent Division of
Personal Property.
OLD HOME ART TREASURES
SELECTION UNDER LAW PASSED
BY THE LAST LEGISLATURE.
Southern Pacific No Longer Controls
the Street Railway SystemâHer
rin Not to Be Retained
as Counsel.
George Crocker, second vice president
of the Southern Pacific Company, leaves
for Now York this evening. He expects
to return to California early in Novem
ber to adjust business affairs requiring
his presence. He has decided, however,
to establish his residence in New York.
His official relations with the Southern
Pacific Company will not terminate until
his successor Is chosen by the directors.
At the last session of the Legislature
a bill was passed amending the law rela
tive to the division of personal property.
The measure was Introduced at the sug- ;
gestion of the attorneys of the Crocker J
Kstiite Company, and passed both houses, j
The Governor approved the bill and it !
became a law. The new law authorizes i
an administrator to make a division of ]
personal property. Before the enactment j
of the law the power of the adminlstra
tor was limited to the disposal or division j
of real estate.
Under the provisions of the new law
George Crocker. Will H. Crocker. Mrs.
Harriet Alexander, together with Charles
Greene nnd Henry T. Si-ott. representing
the children of the late Colonel C. F.
Crocker, elected to divide the personal
property in the Crocker mansion in this
city. The thought of disposing of the j
pictures, ornaments and household treu- 1
sures of the old home at public auction I
was not pleasing to the surviving mem- I
bers of the family; hence they recom
mended the legislation.
The division of the personal property j
was recently made to the satisfaction of
the heirs. The process was simple and
harmonious. Mrs. Alexander selected one j
article. Mr and Mrs. Will Crocker ex- j
pressed a. preference for another. Mr. and i
Mrs. (Jporgp ('rocker made known their I
wishes as to other articles and Charles
Greene. representing Colonel Fred
Crocker's children, also made a selection.
The ornaments and pictures chosen by
Mrs. Alexander and Mr. and Mrs. George
Crocker may go East. It is understood
that the rare paintings and statuary ac
quired by Charles Crocker in the "seven
ties" will remain in California. Indeed
many of the articles, especially those se
lected by Mr. and Mrs. Will Crocker may
remain at the old home. The building
and its belongings may be retained with
out material change for many years, as
sentimental motives for such retention
are constantly suggested.
Railroad alliances may be disturbed by
wars and rumors of wars, but in all the
corporate strife, actual and threatened,
the Crockers have preserved a spirit of
harmony among themselves. The chari
ties which Charles and Mary Crocker
founded have been perpetuated by their
children. Few people comprehend the
magnitude arid worth of these charities,
because the Crockers make no display of
the beneficence.
George and Will Crocker retire from the
railroad business without a single sigh of
regret. Some years ago there were fea
tures of the management which did not
command their approval, but nothing has
recently happened to arouse hostilities be
tween the Huntington and the Crocker in
terests. At the general meeting in New
York General Hubbard and C. P. Hunt
ington readily recognized the rights of
the Crockers In the premises. The popu
lar notion, created by misleading reports
in the press, is to the effect that C. P.
Huntington was then obdurate and vin
dictive, but the fact is that he so readily
assented to the demands of Crocker rep
resentatives that Will Crocker nominated
him for re-election to the presidency of
the company.
In selling their interests in the South
ern Pacific the Crocker? did not part with
their holdings- in the Market street sys
tem. When the estate of Charles Crock
er was settled Colonel Fred Crocker elect
ed to take large blocks of Market street
bonds and stocks. Will Crocker preferred
the bank stock, but took some of the
street railway securities. The controlling
ownership of the Market street system
Ifi rapidly par-sing into the hands of those
who will take it out of the control of the
Southern Pacific Company. Leading mer
chants, bankers and business men have
from time to time purchased securities,
and they resent all attempts to make the
system responsible for the acts of the
Southen Pacific.
The story comes to The Call from a
source which this journal regards as
authentic that W. F. Herrin will shortly
be relieved of his duties as legal adviser
and counsel of the Market Street Railway.
Men who have their money Invested in
the securities of the road do not care to
have their interests associated with Sen
atorial scandals and gold brick enter
prises. Prominent merchants holding
stocks and bonds of the street railway
system have reached the conclusion that
it is time to let the public know that they
wlll soon lie freed from at least a part
of the domination of the Southern Pa
cific Company.

JESSE POTTER DEAD.
The Famous Cattle Man Dies Sud
denly After a Severe Hemorrhage.
Jesse Sheldon Potter, son of Mrs. Miran
da Lux, hero of several sensational law
suits, club man, and perhaps one of the
best known "good fellows" in town. Is
dead. He passed away Sunday afternoon
after a severe hemorrhage.
Jesse Sheldon Potter was one of the
best known and most popular cattlemen
In the State. For many years he was di
rector of Miller & Lux's vast ranches.
"When quite a young lad Jesse Potter
came to California with his mother, who
married Charles Lux. He became quite
prominent about four years ago. when an
attempt" was made to oust him as ex
ecutor of his stepfather's vast estates.
The funeral will take place Thursday
from his late residence, on Pacific avenue
DANGER FROM FIRE.
Public School Buildings a Menace to
the Safety of the Pupils.
Shortly after the disastrous fire at the
Baldwin Hotel the Fire Wardens decided
that all buildings of a certain height
should be provided with fire escapes and
standpipes. and notification was sent to
all the owners and occupants of such
buildings throughout the city. Almost
without exception the request of the Fire
Wardens was complied with, but nothing
has been done in regard to public build
ings.
Yesterday at a meeting of the Fire
Wardens it was decided to call the atten
tion of the Board of Education to the fact
that nothing had been done in that re
spect in regard to public schools, and the
secretary sent a communication to the
board, in which it was pointed out that
the law is being strictly enforced upon
private individuals, "and the fact that
public officials have not been compelled
to comply therewith ie creating comment
We also desire to say that many of the
public school buildings are old frame
structures, with old brick ehtmnes's, and
many of them have been raised and shift
ed from their original positions, which has
a great tendency to cause cracks in the
brick chimneys in concealed places, and
make said buildings doubly liable to take
fire during the winter months."

GAS CONTRACT
TO BE LET IN
INSTALLMENTS
Electric Light Bids
Accepted.
The Board of Supervisors let only a por
tion of the lighting contract yesterday.
The San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany's bid of 5 cents per 1000 watt hours
for incandescent lights in the Gity Hall,
Hall of Justice and Central Police Sta
tion was accepted, and so was its bid of 6
I cents for inside fire stations. Its bid of
15 cents per 1000 for outside stations wae
laid over for a week, upon motion of Su
pervisor Lackmann.
In support of Lackmann's motion, By
ington said that the rate proposed by the
gas company, 11 cents per night, was one
cent in excess of the amount the com
pany had agreed to stick to when the re
cent compromise was made. Mayor Phe
lan said that while the city would save
$11 per day on the electric light bid, it
would lose $48 on the gas. and he thought
that by laying the matter over the com
i pany would be forced to come down in its
I figures. The motion prevailed, and then
Lackmann moved that the bid of $1 35 per
1000 feet for gas also be laid over. After
i pome opposition from Phelps, that motion
also prevailed.
Last night the city was again in dark
ness, but Mayor Phelan announced during
yesterday's meeting that he thought that
Iby to-night some satisfactory arrange
! ment would have been arrived at between
' the city and the gas company. Getting
! light for the city's streets is just now oc
i cupying a good deal of the Mayor's time.
He sought Auditor Wells on Saturday and
requested him to audit the company's
back bills, notwithstanding the one
twelfth act, but this Wells positively re
fused to do. The Mayor argued that al
though the one-twelfth would be exceed
ed It would be made up before the end of
the fiscal year by the rigid economy which
is to be the order. Auditor Wells, how
ever, persisted" in his refusal, and Mayor
I Phelan will to-day have a conference with
President Crockett.
THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC
TO AGAIN RAISE RATES
THE COMPANY WTLL PROFIT BY
A HINT FHOM ENGLAND.
War in the Philippines Forms an Ex
cuse for a Still Greater Pillage
. of the Public.
The Southern Pacific sees another dollar
In sight, and, as usual, Is reaching: for It,
irrespective of whose interests are hurt
by the operation. The merchants of this
city imagined that the limit of their
troubles had been reached when It was
announced that the rates on the staple
products of this State would take about |
a 20 per cent jump on October 10. But â¢
they are mistaken. They had not fath- ;
omed the cupidity of the great corpora- j
tion nor figured on the lengths to which
It would push its audacity. If they had <
they might have expected that which is |
about to happenâ another jump !n the al
ready heavy tribute they are forced to pay
and one which this time will affect trans-
Pacific as well as transcontinental traffic.
Yesterday the Southern Pacific received
word by cablegram that the owners of the ;
English ocean lines contemplated a raise
of rates because of the big drain that hits
been made upon them to supply vessels I
to be used as transports and storeships
for the moving of troops in anticipation !
of the expected trouble in the Transvaal.
This gave the Southern Pacific officials
a new Idea, If such a move was to be I
made by the English shipping men, why j
could n*6t the war in. the Philippines be I
made an excuse to further increase the
taxation of the merchants of the Pacific
Coast? If such a rule would apply to the |
freight traffic, why would it not apply to
the ocean passenger traffic? If it would ;
apply to the freight carried in seagoing
bottoms, why would it not be equally I
beneficial to carriers by rail?
The scheme was excellent. Transporta
tion facilities are now so tied up that it
is next to impossible for the merchants to
do anything but acquiesce or go out of
business. The Southern Pacific has them;
on the hip and it is going to toss them as i
high as possible. It is going to increase
the already exorbitant rates and if the
shippers don't like it they will have to do
the next best thing.
How soon this new idea will becomeÂ»n
actual fact it is impossible' to say, mit
the time Is near for it to be sprung- and
the wholesale men of the city may expect '
to receive almost any day one of thoso I
ukases which this time will mean they j
will either have to submit to being plun- <
dered or shut up shop and wait patiently
for the coming of the Santa Fe.
When seen on the subject yesterday, J.
C. Stubbs third vice president of the
