CAPE TOWN, Aug. 19.â A j
great sensation has been caused
here by a statement in the Times,
a local newspaper, that Premier
Schreiner, since the crisis as
sumed an acute phase, has al
lowed 1,000,000 rounds of car
tridges to be moved from Port
Elizabeth to Bloemfontein for use
of the Transvaal Republic. Mr.
Schreiner. in an interview held an
hour prior to the writing of this
dispatch, explained that the inci
dent was- five weeks' old. The
cartridges, he said, were the ab
solute property of the Orange
Free State, the relations of which
with England were perfectly
friendly. He said that he saw
no objection to their removal.
PRETORIA, Aug. 19.â
Pretoria Government is incensed
at the detention of munitions of
war in transit to the Transvaal
by the Portuguese authorities at
Delagoa Bay. President Kruger
and Vice President Joubert are
openly opposed to the Volks
raad's report on the dynamite
concession. It is said that the
Government was on the point of
returning a favorable reply to
England's invitation for a joint
inquiry into the Outlanders'
grievances when the news of the
Delagoa Bay episode arrived, and
the reply was in consequence
withheld.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, AUGUST 20, 1899â THIRTY-TWO PAGES.
Kruger's reply to Chamberlain,
it is said, was to have been
handed the British agent to-day,
but this was postponed until Mon
day. The Government declines
to state the nature of the reply.
SIGNS POINT TO THE
LIKELIHOOD OF WAR
LONDON, Aug. 19. â Though many
sisns point to the extreme likelihood of
war between Great Britain and the
Boers, and though troops are pouring
in the direction of the Cape, and the
British array chiefs are deep in prob
lems of preparation for possible hos
tilities, the English people as a whole
scarcely heed the portents that at an
other time would raise a whirlwind of
patriotic enthusiasm. The n
sppms completely absorbed in the Drey
fus case. As each day passes without
an answer from tho Boers to the propo
sition of Great Britain for a joint com
mission to Investigate the effect which
the franchise reform legislation would
have on the Outlanders, th^ probability
of a pacific settlement of tho difficulty
decreases. Yet, national interest, tired
of delay, flags as the tension at the
War and Colonial offices grows: If war
comes Great Britain will awake with a
tremendous start.
If the Boers surrender to the British
demands scarcely more than a ripplf
of interest will be excited, so long a?
the Rennes court-martial holds the
world under the spell of its dramatic
rf-rital. From a political point of view
a rapid and successful war against the
Boers would probably strengthen the
hands c/f the Conservative Government
more than any other outcome of the
pr^pent crisis, for the vast preponder
ance of punlir- sentiment already heart
ily indorses the course of Mr. Chamber
lain, Secretary of State for the Colo
nies, and if only the British soldiers
could meÂ«t thfir old enemy, the Boers,
few would remain hold enough to open
ly oppose th^ morality of the war.
Many awkward questions in regard to
the Government's home policy are
pending, and perhaps It is fortunate for
the Conservative party that the exist
ing events abroad distract attention
from them. Of these home matters
none is more serious than the Church
of England problem. The Conservative
press and broad-minded clergy are beg
ging the ritualists to obey the decision
of the Archbishops against their prac
tices, but, as the Daily Graphic says:
"Now we have come to the parting of
the ways, and even before the various
iiishops have formally issued their
anti-ritualist order, prominent clergy
men have raised the flag of rebellion
and defiance. The high church party
seems hopelessly divided as to whether
to temporarily obey or to openly defy. 1
The Saturday Review to-day in an
article on Europe and Americans, sneer
ing at the proposed Anglo-American
alliance, frankly declares that it
amounts to little or nothing. "We
have," the Review says, "accepted it
almost as an axiom of sound policy that
friendly relations with the United
States is the only object worth aiming
at in the Western Hemisphere. A few
music hall ditties and after-dinner
speeches would convince us that the
object is secured and that we should
forthwith ignore all American concerns
as contemptible strife of parties."
The Review goes on to say there ir
nothing in all that. "Our future in the
west never received so severe a blow
as that dealt it by Lord Salisbury's
recognition of the right of North Amer
ican interference in South American
concerns."

NEUTRALITY LAWS
ARE TO BE ENFORCED
WASHINGTON, Aug. 19.â Secretary
! Root said this afternoon that he had
been informed of the arrest of General
Jiminez, the Dominican leader, by
i the Collector of customs at Cienfuegos.
! This action was presumably taken by
direction of General Brooke. Nothing
has been received here indicating that
; Jiminez has been released, and General
Brooke has not asked for instructions,
nor will any be given him unless he ,
specifically requests advice. The ar
rest of Jimlnezis douhtless in accord-'
lance with instructions recently sent to
! General Brooke, directing him to pre
â  vent any violation of the neutrality;
j laws of the T'nitcd States by persons
'residing In " Cuba. He was especially
directed to maintain careful surveil
lance over Jiminez, and it is presumed
I the lattt-r's arrest was ordered when
: General Brooke deemed he had suffi
cient evidence to hold him for legal pro
ceedings.
The report of his release is very sur
prising. The administration officials
are still struggling with the question of
whether the neutrality laws of this
Government can be applied to Cuba,
which is only temporarily under its con- !
trol. It is a recognized principle of in- j
ternational law that any territory un
der control of the military authorities \
shall not be made the base of military j
operations against a foreign Govern
ment with which the country exercising j
â¢ such control is at peace.
It cannot be stated by the authorities
' what court could take cognizance of
j any violation of neutrality by Jimi
| nez or any of his associates, or what
i laws could be applied, but they are cer
! tain that this Government has ample
authority to prevent filibustering from
Cuba, and they propose to see that it is
i respected. .
GROCERS COMBINE TO

NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â The sugar trust
and incidentally other concerns which
manufacture supplies dealt in by grocers
are to have opposition In their respective
lines.
In Newark. N. J., a New York Retail
Grocers' Association has been incorpor
ated with a capitalization of $200,000, there
being fifty incorporators, of whom forty
seven are New York grocers and the oth
er three Russell J. Williams, Bernard S.
McKcan and John S. Price. The company
has combined with the following com
panies, whose capital stock ranges from
$25,000 to $200,000 each: The Philadelphia
Grocers' Company, Altoona Grocers' Com
pany. Cleveland Grocers' Company, Mid
dletown Grocers' Company. Boston Gro
cers' Company. Syracuse Retail Grocers*
Company. Scranton Grocers' Company
and Utlca Grocers' Company. Messrs.
Williams. McKean and Price represent
the Advanced Beet Sugar Construction
Company.
Mr. McKean. in speaking of the matter,
said: "The construction company owns
an interest in the beet sugar factory In
Rome, N. V., and will erect other fac
tories for tho manufacture of beet sugar
elsewhere in New York State. Beet sugar
will be sold to stockholders of the Retail
Grocers' Association direct, thus saving
middlemen's profits. Small retail grocers 1
will also be enabled to buy other goods at
wholesale prices through â¢ the company
whenever needed and in as small quan
tities as they may desire, which formerly
they were 'unable to do except through a
wholesale dealer." .-

SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER
DREYFUS WILL BE CONVICTED
From Rennes Comes One Story That the Court-
Martial Has Already Decided That the
Accused Captain Is Guilty*
Maitres Mornard and Demange, Counsel for Dreyfus
(From a sketch made during a session of the Court of Cassation.) <$>
RKNNES. Aug. 19.â Opinions differ!
as to what the judgment of the
Dreyfus tribunal will be. Towns
people who know well General
Germain and General Lucas of
the army corps think the decision will
be against the accused. On thÂ»Â» other j
hand at the Hotel Modere. which is ,
now the great conversational news cen- .1
ter, the idea prevails of a reluctant
judgment in his favor.
The tribunal certainly shares the feel
ings of th^ military witnesses, but '
there are signs of coming around. I
noticed a member of the court-martial
watching Dreyfus to-day with an ex- '
pression of compassionate interest. :
Then, again. Colonel Jouaust. the presi
dent, did not rebuke him for apostro
phlzing Major Cuignet, who led the Dro- I
cession of military witnesses to-day.
nor order him. as he was wont to do.
not to speak until he was addressed.
Maitre Demange Is more hopeful, al- !
though acknowledging the perverse use
the Nationalists make of the Schneider
and Panizzardi telegrams to inflame
patriotic sentiment. That party now
demands the full publication of the
secret dossier so as to heap disgrace
on the military attaches and the illus
trious German Prince involved a Prince
who lived long in Paris.
I should not be surprised at a tie.
This would enable the prisoner to leave
the court a free man, but would show
that half the judges believed him 1
guilty.
The Schneider letter or telegram is i
resented by all but the Dreyfusites as
an attempt to cast odium on the French i
army. It ought to benefit the prisoner, j
but does not. Military men say it !
would set the face of the court-martial
harder against him.
The majority seem to adopt Cuignet's <
opinion. It is thought, though not ex- \
pressed, thus: That the military at- \
tat hes have behaved abominably in the
Dreyfus affair; that the French Gov- :
ernment is in possession of numerous j
specimens of Schneider's handwriting: j
that the document on which General !
Mercier relied will be a severe test and
that it has been accepted by every j
Minister of War since 1594 and been i
compared with letters written to six :
of them by Colonel Schneider.
Cuignet spoke with a hollow voice, |
quite different from that in which some j
days ago he made his virulent attack I
on Dreyfus. His attitude, however. |
was as assertive as before, though his
language was less so. He Is a fair,
sandy-haired man. with a big red mus- I
tache and a resonant, metallic voice,
good for command. He is among the
few military witnesses who have de
posed while standing.
To-day his task was to destroy the
effect of the question of Maitre De
mange and to set up again the demol- 1
ished theory of General Mercier. Cuig- |
net was In the fourth bureau of the j
general staff when Dreyfus was in an-
Other bureau there, but not under his
orders. They were both engaged in cal
culating what work invasion would
throw on the railways, but were en
gaged on different lines.
Dreyfus, he said, constantly came to
him for Information which he had no |
cause to do. Cuignet kept refusing un- |
til he was tired out hy the importunities
of the accused. Then, by degrees, he
gave him, Cuignet deposed, all the
notes he himself had made. Dreyfus,
according to the witness, never re
turned the notes. When search was
made at his home they were not found.
What had become of them? Dreyfus
was not the man to cast them away.
Cuignet's Insinuation was that they
were sent to Berlin. The conclusion
was far fetched, but the members of
the court-martial made a note of it.
Cuignet then defended Esterhazy
against Picquart and next against Dv |
Paty de Clam. He gave fresh peeps at
the secret military dossier, in which
are many ordinary letters from women,
opinions on public men and tittle-tat
tle of a spicy sort. Cuignet said he
was sorry the court had not examined
this voluminous dossier, which proved
a deal of light, sometimes crude light
"on spies of different categories, in
cluding military attaches." The latter,
he remarked, were far from oeing the
only spies regularly kept up by foreign
Governments. It was only natural, he
argued, that the military attaches
should accuse Esterhazy, but they
knew the traitor had been in the very
heart of the citadel, In the general
staff.
"The traitor," he exclaimed, "is not

Esterhazy, but Dreyfus." Here Cap
tain Dreyfus lost his self-control. j
Starting to his feet, he violently apos- ;
trophised Cuignet. If he had ' been a
Fish torpedo he could not have seemed
more charged with electricity. But
Cuignet did not seem stung to anger.
Cold as a toad he went on with his in
vective, the diction clear, measured
and slow. He constantly drank sweet
ened water to moisten his palate.
In speaking of Colonel Picquart. he
said nature intended him for a novelist;
that he was first rate at the construc
tion of a plot: that Gaboriau did not
touch him in this respect and that Pic- 1
quart's deduction showed "romantic in- !
vention bordering on genius."
No new fact was brought forward by ,
Cuignet, and every one was tired of ;
him. When he turned to Colonel â 
Schneider's Ems telegram, which he '
compared to another dispatch from
Ems that let loose invasion upon
France, Maitre Demange shrugged his
shoulders.
General de Boisdeffre was also a wit- 1
ness., He denied that Colonel Picquart
on the occasion of the . first Dreyfus j
trial was sent with secret papers to the
President of the court-martial. He was
a cautious witness, but he had to sup- j
port the other generals/ He eulogized
the suicide of Henry as "worthy of the
fullest confidence," and spoke of Pic- j
quart as "the organizer of the Dreyfus
agitation."
â  Boisdeffre declared himself convinced
of the guilt of the accused. Really, the
"guilty" might be . the subject of a
chorus of generals in an opera houffe.
Picquart, he accused of wishing to '
substitute a man of straw for the real
traitor. He argued in this wise: The !
three years Dreyfus spoke of on the day ;
of his degradation had passed. Pro- I
scription for the crime of treason
would, therefore, protect a man of \
straw from legal consequences. As he
was, Picquart perhaps thought, a
scamp, no great injury would be done
by throwing on him the odium that j
Dreyfus deserved. Nevertheless, he
(the witness) had learned of Picquart's j
scheme, black and abominable. "Ester
hazy now admits himself the author of
the bordereau," remarked Boisedeffre.
"but did he ever tell the truth? He lies
still, as he always has."
But why follow General Boisdeffre?
Why follow General Gonse? Why fol

RENNES, Aug. 13.â Xo special inci

counsel for th--> d^fr-nse. who succeeds 1
in pointing out that several of hi?
statements contradicted his prerlotu
depositions.
The president of the court. Colonel

against him, an innocent man. General.;

special Investigations into the case which
I was ordered to m.ikf by Ministers <>f
War fmni M. < - to H. de Frey

tion a personal fact, which, in conjunc

constitute fresh proof of the prisoner's
indiscreet behavior when employed on the
headquarters staff. I was on the staff
whpn Dreyfus was a probationer, during
the 'latter half of 1893. Among other
duties. I was connected with the railroa<l
service and the mining of railroads, with
the view of Interrupting traffic in case of
need. It is hardly necessary to point out
the secret character of BÂ«ch matters.
Dreyfus was a probationer on thf Eastern
railroad, and bad been ordered to special

him to know thp general scheme in order

TO STARVE OUT GUERIN
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899,
by Jnmes Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, Aug. 10.â The situation in the Hue de Chabrol is unchanged. It
looks as if the anti-Semitic fortress was not as plentifully provisioned
.is has been reported. During the night the sound of a heavy packet
thrown from the house opposite and falling on the pavement at
tracted the attention of the police. It turned out to contain a ten
pound leg of mutton. A minute later a five-pound loaf of bread fell
Into the street. The loss of his provisions exasperated Guerin, who
opened the window and shouted: "In the nineteenth century you try to
starve people. It is disgraceful. You," he added, addressing the police
men, "you ought to have more heart than your masters and ought to give
us back our provisions. In any case I warn you that the first time my com
; panions are hungry if a Prefect of Police passes along the street we will
shoot him." ' â  .
l understand that the garrison is also provisioned by food let down in
baskets from the roof of a house alongside. The inhabitants of the Rue
de Chabrol have complained bitterly of the state of siege. Shopkeepers

Nationalist Deputies continue their visits to Guerin. Negotiations, how
ever, have so far been fruitless, the only result being to increase the impor
tance of Guerin in the eyes of the public, as it creates ah Idea that be is

afternoon the blockade of the fortress was rendered still, more strict. Em
ploys of the g.is company cut off the gas.
No i ii' . hot even journalists armed with special cards, is allowed to
station himself in front of the anti-Semite headquarters. The line of
municipal guards, leaning on their rifles, now surround the place. The au-
t horities examined the sowers in order to make sure that the garrison was
unable to leave by this means, and all the exits of the sewers are now
guarded by the police. Fears are expressed that if the garrison sees star
vation staring them In the face they may take a desperate resolution and
begin hostilities. â¢ â  '
A secret agent has denounced a plot to make away with M. Guillaume.
officer de paix. in charge of the police. The anti-Semites had planned to
isolate him from his men and in a crowd shoot him with their revolvers.
The leader in this plot, a man named Henry, was arrested in a cafe. He
carried a loaded revolver and eighteen cartridges. He denied any intention
to assassinate Gulllaume, but declared that he had decided to shoot dead the
first policeman who laid hands on him.
It has been noticed that the crowds in the vicinity of the Rue de Chahrol
have become larger and more and more threatening every day. It is impos
sible to find out their political opinions, as they utter no party cries except
an occasional shout of "Vive Guerin!" But they hoot and hiss the police
â  and Republican Guards. The supply of water has been cut off from the
house. Sewer laborers arrived at 2 o'clock this morning, and when the Re-.
publican Guards arrived at 4 o'clock they found that the sewer connection
had been walled off from the house. Guerin appeared at the window an.l
â¢said: "What's the use of these maneuvers? If they wish to attack us let
them do so, otherwise let us sleep in peace." The drains leading from the
house are entirely blocked up.
Signs are not wanting that the troubles are about to extend. Anarchists
have published a proclammatton in the Journal dv Peuple calling their par
tisans to demonstrate in the street, a rendezvous is fixed for 3 o'clock at
â¢the Place de la Republique. They have also established themselves in va
â  rious centers, so as to communicate with each other by means of the tele
phone, messengers and cycles. At. the first signal these groups are ready to
unite and march in a body. As it is feared that the garrison of "Fort
Chabrol" may escape by the sewers, a guard has been placed over all the
exits in the vicinity. In the. course of the day M. Monquen. second in com
mand of the municipal police, took charge of the operations in the Rue de
Chabrol and gave strict orders that no provisions of any sort should be al
lowed to reach the garrison. â¢ . - . â

"The first question I will ask here." said
the witness, "is. is Dreyfus guilty? My

the witness said he still believed they

â  the confessions to Captain Lebrun- |
Renaud they will believe no human testi
mony."
Continuing, the witness reasserted that
the bordereau was wriifn by Dreyfus at
.1 of August, and Incidentally the
major protested against Colonel Pic-;
quart's Insinuation against Dv Paty do i
Clam. He then returned to the secret |
dossier of the War office, from which, he |
declared, the court was sure tn draw im
portant deductions.
"The first portion of the dossier," he
paid, "shows that in 1893 there was a con
stant leakage in the Ministry of War.
We have had proofs of the plant of fort I- j

Witness then invited the court's special
attention to this dossier, in which he said
would be found ample proof of the pris
oner's guilt.
At this stage of the proceedings Drey
fus rose ana lnt< rrupted the witness,
shouting: "That is n manifest lie."
After this the witness recited in detail j
his reasons for the belief that the agent j
supplying 'he Information was a French |
Btaff officer. He then endeavored to show
that traffic with foreign military attaches
could only have been carried on by a pro
bationer in the department occupied by
Dreyfus.

FOUR POUNDS OF FLESH
From One Pound of Food.
The statement Is made that one
pound of Grape-Nuts will supply, more
nourishment (that the system will ab-
eorb), than 10 lbs. of meat, wheat, |
or oats.
A man protested that the claim was
extravagant, but upon trial it was
found that by leaving off meat alto- j
gether at breakfast and lunch, and tak- !
ing in its place 4 heaping teaspoons j
of Grape-Xuts began to gain . flesh '
and strength and before the full pound '
package Tfaa gone had gained 4 lbs.
In weight, whereas he had been losing
on his meat diet.
How could he gain 4 lbs. and only
eat 1 lb. Grape-Nuts? Remember the 4
teaspoons of Grape-Nuts are but a
portion of the meal, but they furnish
the pie-digested and easily assimilated
part and help digest other foods, assist-
ing nature in building In water (75 per

Grape-Nuts furnish the workers or the
active elements of food in the most
perfect condition for nature to make

attache of Paris, denouncing as a forgery
a letter purporting to have been written
by the attache, in which he was repre- i
sented as referring to efforts being made
by Schwarzkoppen and Panusardl to eon- ;
ceal their relations with Dreyfus, witness
maintained, that General Mercier's state- !
merits on the subject were correct and
that the authenticity of the letter had |
be Â proved. The intelligence depart- I
ment, he added, had other documents
from the same attache in its possession. !
Major Culgnet pointed nut that the I
Schneider document was included in the !
dossier and that M. Channine, who had I
the secret dossier In his charge, had
shown it to the court in behalf of the
Minister of War. Therefore, witness
claimed, Colonel Schneider's contradiction
was really addressed to the French Gov
ernment." (Sensation.)
"Besides," added Culgnet. "I wish to
point out that the attache issuing the de
nial is a person of somewhat less conse
quence than his allies. It is therefore
possible that this denial was imposed up- j
on him." (Renewed sensation).
The witness dwelt admiringly on the i
conclusions of M. Bertillon that Kst^rhazy
had learned to Imitate tho handwriting of
the bordereau after Its publication In the j
Matin.
He then reviewed the police reports on
Dreyfus. Replying to a question of the
court, Ciiienet described the circum
stances of the discovery of the Henry for- j
geTy, and how it was that the proba-
Boners did not participate, in the maneuv
ers of 1894. although they had long be
lieved they would attend.
Major Carriere, the Government's com
missary, at this Juncture said he thought |
it desirable to remark us the representa- !
live of tha Government that he must not '
be understood to indorse all Major Cuip
net had said with "reference to a foreign j
military efflcer who at the present mo
ment held a diplomatic appointment In
France." (Sensation).
Replying to M. Demange, Major Culg
net insisted that if Henry committed for
jr< ry "it was in the Interests of the I
country." To this statement, counsel re
torted, "you did not say that to the Court
of Cassation."
At the request of M. Demange the ma-
Jofs deposition before the Court of Cas
sation relating to Henry's motives and
De Clam's share In the preparation of the
forgery was read. It showed that Cuigntt
emphatically declared before the Court
of Cassation that he was convinced an
investigation would easily show that De
Clam was the principal author, of the
Henry forgery.
Witness claimed that he thought he was
doing his duty "in saying all that was In
my mind."
"Do you adhere " asked counsel, "to a.l
you have said before the Court of Cassa
tion?"
The question greatly confused the wit
ness, who attempted to explain by saying
he was "only arguing at that tirm; and
that it was not for him to judge Paty de
Ciam."
M. Demange pointed out that In spite
of the many arguments Major Culgnet
had advanced against De Clam, the mili
tary judge, Tavenler, threw out the case.
"Now. 1 added M. Demange, "Majci
Cuignet has advanced as much against
Dreyfus. The court will be able to appre
ciate the value of his arguments."
counsel then asked why Culgnet had
employed the expression "report" to de
' scribe the Schneider letter, and the wit
ness replied that he was justified In doing
I so. owing to the similarity of the expres
sions in it with the terms usually era
ploved in reports.
M. Demange pointed out that the docu
â  ment included in the dossier contained the
word "report."
"Dees the original," he asked, "contain
, this word?"
"No," replied the witness.
Replying further, Culgnet said the docu
ment also referred to the campaign in fa
vor of Dreyfus and to orders sent to
; Brussels, the headquarters of the osploti
! a S (i system.
M. Demangeâ The paper handed In by
General Mtrc'er is therefore only an ex
tract.
The witness next gave his idea as to
how Dreyfus might have secured plans
of the fortress. But counsel pointed
to Dv Paty de Clam's report at the time
of the arrest of Dreyfus, in which he de
â  dared that no document had disappeared
or could have disappeared from the Min
istry of War.
When Dreyfus was asked if he wished
!to reply to this witness he declared he
had neve* asked Major Cuignet for dOcu
; nients except by the desire of hla chle!,
i Major Bertln.
"All the details which Major Cui^net
! has given on this subject, " said the pris
-1 oner, "sprang out of his own Imagination.
! and arc- due to the same state of mind
which prompts unreasoning bitterness
1 even against an innocent man."
[ Amid a buzz of excitement the name of
j Major dv Paty do Clam was called out,
I whe-reupon Major Carriere said De Clam
; had been officially Informed that his pfes
I once was necessary to the court-martial
1 and It Was hoped he would be able to come
j Â«s soon as possible, but the Government

decided to notify De Clum that the court

chief of the. general staff of the French

took the customary oath to tell the truth
The general remarked that in view of the

brun-Renaud. Witness said he believed i
tli. confessions were genuine. Ho next, i
referred to Colonel Plcquart's appearance
in the Intelligence Department, although
the witness had hesitated to appoint him.
because ho thought Plcquart-tQO self-con- i
fident and n<>t sufficiently deferential to
ward his chiefs, <
"It has been said." continued Genera!
de BoisdeSre. "that a secret package of 1
papers was shown to the judges of the
court-martial of' 1E94. I positively assert I
that so far as I am concerned 1 never or- I
dered Colonel Picquart to- convey .any en- i
velojM to Colonel Maurel. I may add that ! ]
Colonel Picquart never doubted the *:mlt >
of Dreyfus and never even expressed |
doubts of his guilt when lie took over the
duties of Chief of the intelligence Depart
ment. I
"The first instructions I gave him were 1
to follow up the Dreyfus affair and it Is
well known what was the result of those
instructions."
Tlie general next described the interview '
between himself and Colonel Picquart, I;
whtn the latter lirst mentioned Eeterhazy, â 
Without, however, connecting him with
the Dreyfus affair. Witness discredited
Colonel Picquart'a statement that the latr â 
ter asked him (witness* not to .mention
the investigation to General Gonse.
"General Gonse," said !>â¢> Boisdeffre,
"is a friend of thirty years" standing. I
have always had the greatest confidence
in him and certainly should not have en
tertained an Idea to leave him in ignor- I
â t" what was occurring."
General de Boisdeffre, whose evidence
was attentively followed, especially by c
thf> members of the court-martial, then
related the incidents of his interview with
Picquart, how hu sent Picquart to see
Genera] Gonse and General Gonse'a sub
sequent letter to the witness advising a
continuance of the Investigation regarding
Esterhaxy, bui adding that the affair
must not be mixed up with the Dreyfus
affair. As Colonel Picquart persisted in
trying to hurry matters and was neglects
iiiK his other duties, the witness proposed
to the Minister of War to send him not
in disgrace to a mission to Tonklng, but
the Minister of War. the general asserted,
found another mission f.ir him.
everything, the general added, went
quietly for a year, until M. Schuer'er-
Kestner Intervened. This was followed
by the denunciation of Bsterhazy by Mat
thlf-u Dreyfus. an>l the Inquiry into Kstor
ha7.y's< proceedings
"At that time," the witness said. "I was
convinced of the Kuilt of Dreyfus, and
this conviction Is as strong to-day hs
I ever. (Sensation.)
"I regard it as an abominable crime to
have endeavored to substitute for him
a man of straw, however disreputable he
may have been and whatever his offenses,
which, in any case, would not lessen the
guilt of Dreyfus. My conviction is the
i same as at the commencement of the af
j f-alr. Esterhazy. it is true, to a certain
psycological and well-chosen moment,
I confessed to .have written the bordereau,
I but he has made many other statements.
He is always telling lies. What is cer- ;
tain is that he could never have delivered
| the documents enumerated in the bor
dereau."
Then the witness briefly referred to the
trial and acquittal of Bsterhazy and thÂ»
! latter's threats to proclaim himself a tool
of the genera! staff, after which the gen
eral alluded to the Henry forgery and M.
Cavaignac's Interrogations of Henry.
"You know the result." said he. appar
! ently much moved. "I will not tell you
! what I suffered at that moment. As soon
â  as everything was ended, 1 tendered my
resignation, iiut was asked to withdraw
I it. I was told everyone could make a

i there was nothing left for him but to go

I aloof." Sensation.)
Replying to tho court. General de BoiS
i deffre admitted that the leakage at mil
itary headquarters continued after the |
condemnation of Dreyfus. It ceased for &
; year, but in ]#â¢." a paper was discovered
proving the communication to a foreign
j government of a document relating to the
[distribution of the artillery and showing;
! that a foreign government was perfectly
| acquainted with the changes made.
Answering a question put by a member
of the court-martial relative to the con- |
Hid ing testimony of General Mercler, the
former Minister of War, and M. Casimir-
Perier. formerly President of the French
republic, witness replied that he certainly
had up. interview with General Mercler
early In January, during the course of
which Mefeler remarked in regard to the
representations of a foreign Ambassador
to the President of the republic. "It is not'
(going to happen this -time, either. You 1
can sl^en in peace. The incident has been
settled.
De BoiFdeffre declared he was no less
certain of what had been said in regard |
to the confessions pf Captaia Luebrun-Cte- i
ii.i'i'l. The gener.il was also perfectly cer
taln the incident at the Klysee did not oc. j
cur January 5, 1895. It was, he said, the i
6th or 7th.
"What is certain," added he, "is that
when it occurred f remained personally at
the Ministry of War."
M. Demange referred to General Roget' S
deposition to the effect that Dreyfus was
certainly Intelligent, but that hf woiiid 'â 
not hnvf- wished to ccc him on the head- j
! quarters staff, and asked the witness' j
opinion on the subject. The general an- i
' swered: "I can only express the same '
I opinion as General Ropet."
M. Demangeâ Was not Esterhazy, with
your knowledge, assisted at the court of
inquiry by Major Dv Paty de Clam, who
I gave him advice?
De Boisdeffreâ l am absolutely not aware
! of it.
Colonel Jounust, president of the court
â  martial, put the usual questions to the I
j prisoner, who replied: "1 have nothing to
say to General de Boisdeffre," and re
sumed his seat.
After a brief suspension of the sitting
of the court General Gonse. who was |
under-chief of the general staff, was
called to the witness stand. He explained <
| the motives which influenced his actions j
I during the past few years, and said he j
believed he was "animated by the loftiest
: Minis, namely, the protection of the army i
I against the criminal attacks made on it j
i from all i-id. s."
In this connection General Gonse dwelt i
! on the danger to France of the "system of !
espionage so cleverly organized ugainst j
I her by foreigners," and said that in spite ;
' of Esterhazy's statement It was impos
: slhle for him to have written the bor- ]
: dereau, and still more Impossible for him
! to have secured the information contained
therein. He added that there were no ;
traces of Indiscretion discovered during I
I the investigation against Esterhazy. Con- ;
tlnulng, the witness deplored the fact that
i the court-martial of 1594 was held behind !
! closed doors, addiuf: "I regard it as a j
i great misfortune. The witnesses cer
tainly said a great (Wai more at the secret !
i trial than they would have done at a pub- j
1 lie trial. But the Judges had a better op- !
portunity of forming an opinion, even !
though the public might maintain doubts, i
! I deplore It keenly."
General Gonse denied that Esterhazy i
j had received money from the Intelligence i
Department, and, describing the "strange j
behavior" of Dreyfus and his "frequent
! acts of indiscretion." the witness begged
tho court to summon the secretary- or the
Ministry of War who surprised the pris- j
oner prying in the offices at a time when j
there was no business going on. The Gen
eral defended M. Gueree and referred to
the spy as an "honorable man" whose
nanie he could not give, as having fur
nlshed military headquarters with valu
able int..! iiiation.
Colonel Jouaust asked, "Is he in receipt
of regular monthly pay?"
General Gonst â He was paid when he
brou m( Information.
Major Carriereâ We â¢ have here two dif
f- rein versions.
Genera! (Juiiseâ l mean to say that as
he watched others he was paid his ex
penses, as we ilid not want him to be out
nf pocket.
After the witness had asserted that
while the name of Dreyfus was often
mentioned in the documents in the pos
session of the Intelligence department
his innocence was nowhere hinted at.
the general then proceeded to defend
Dv Paty <le Clam from the Insinuations
of Colonel Picquart and corroborated
Genera] Mercier's evidence in regard to
the alleged confessions made to Captain
Lebrun-Henaud. Witness learned, how
ever, that Captain I,ebrun-Renaud, "in
timidated by the censure of M. Casimir
i'i rier," did not dare to repeat those con
fessions and gavj only an incomplete ac
count of the occurrences at the time of
the prisoner's degradation. There was no
truth, the witness said, in Colonel I'lc
quarts statements in regard to his (Gen
eral Oonse's) excitement January 5. The
general said he learned of the. ESmbassa
dor's action January ti. The general de
nied other statements made by Picquart
and referred to the alleged number of Â«r
--rests ordered by Picquart on "unfounded
charges of espionage."
Considerable comment was aroused by
the fact that, contrary to the provisions
of the law requiring the testimony to be
Vi i I'll and without notes. General Gonse,
adjusting his eyeglasses, proceeded to
consult a large notebook and frequently
refr< shed his memory.
.Dealing with the Henry forgery General
Gonse said: "I can say it was already
known. General Roget spoke to me about
it at least eight days before Henry con
i'iss. a." (Sensation, i
One of the court asked if the witness
knew that a document relating to the
conveying of troops was tor twenty-four
hours" in the hands of the prisoner, and
if he knew that Imaginary sketches exe
cuted by the prisoner had been delivered
abroad.
General Gonseâ l could not give a posi
tive answer to that question.
â  "Are there proofs that the documents
mentioned in the bordereau were deliv
ered abroad?"
"There were no direct proofs, but their
dispatch was certainly announced."
Proceeding, witness disputed Magistrate
Brrtulus' account of the interview with
Henry, but added that when he (Gonse)
handed Henry his forgery, the latter in
sisted that it must not be shown to Plc
quart. (Sensation. )
Replying to M. uemange. witness ad
mitted he had ordered Colonel Picquart
n.it to concern himself with the handwrit
ing of the bordereau when he commenced
his investigations of Esterhazy.
"Then," asked M. Demange sharply,
"when you saw his handwritings were
Identical with the writing of the bor
dereau that made no impression on your
"Evidently," replied the witness, "the
handwritings had great resemblance."
M. Demange- The "honorable" person
already referred to was not in receipt of
pay. you Bald just now?
Gonseâ The person was not an agent.
He, indeed, wished to procure us inform
ation in and out of Europe, but he con
cerned himself with agents and his ex
penses were paid.
M Demangeâ Do you regard this pcisor
Oonseâ He only supplied information.
M. Demange -Did you not say that ihls
person had been proposed for the cross
of the Legion of Honor, and that if he
was not decorated it was because some
one had intervened to prevent it?
Gonseâ l never heard of it.
Demangeâ Very good.
When Dreyfus was asked the regc.lar
question he said: "I will reply
direct to the secretary of the
Ministry of War, who said he
saw me in the offices after hours. As
regards General Gonse, I am surprised
that the general officer repeats dinner ta
ble gossip.. There is known to be Insur
mountable difficulty in introducing any
one into the Ministry of War, and it is
absolutely impossible for an officer to
bring any one into the Ministry."
To this the general replied:, "No doubt
it is difficult."
Colonel Jouaustâ No doubt it is diffi
cult, but it is not impossible. The Bflnls-
I try can be entered easily enough at cer
tain hours. Dreyfus was in a position to
know that. (Sensation.)
The prisonerâ l will reply to Secretary
! Kerrel, who lias told 8 lie. AVhat I haw
' to Bay tv Genera] Qonve is that every time
a friend came to see me at the Ministry.
â¢ \> ii when a French officer. I was obliged
to descend to the floor below, and even
! members of the Chamber of Deputies
who called on me could not enter the Min
j istry. It was consequently absolutely im
possible under ordinary circumstances for
j a subaltern to bring any one Into the Min
j istry.
General Gonse declared that permits
could easily be obtained.
At this point Colonel Picquart re-entered
I the witness box In order to reply to al
legations ns to the way he performed his
duties. He denied a number of General
| Gonsc.'s statements regarding the arrests
I the witness ordered.
j Colonel Picquart also described the ex
traordinary methods of Investigation em
ployed in the Intelligence Department by
his predecessor.
Counsel for the defense, after emphasiz
ing the fact that even in the opinion of
General de Boisdeffre there wa* a con
nection between the Esterhazy and Drey
fus affairs, asked the president of the
court to request Colonel Picquart to give
I information regarding the 100,000 francs
said to have been expended for the sur
veillance of Ksterhazy.
Picquart explained how expenditures
were regulated in the Intelligence depart
! ment. While witness was chief of the
: department General Billot, then Minister
j of War. thought it necessary to make a
fr^sh distribution of the amounts of the
i secret service funds available at the dif
ferent offices, and the funds in the wit
ness' department were diminished by 80
--i 000 francs monthly. At this moment Plc
! quart said negotiation* of great import
j ajice were in progress and an e.xtraordl
: nary expenditure had been arranged be
! forehand.
; "This decrease In the funds," continued
, Picquart, "did not prevent me from pur
suirig the extremely interesting questions
upon which I was engaged. I made a
memorandum. In which I asked for a sup
j plementary grant, and 100,000 francs were
. given me. When the 100.000 francs was re
ceived General Billot made another re
: distribution. In no case no extraordinary
expenditure was made in connection with
j the Esterhazy inquiry. There could not
; be an inquiry costing less.
"In a note sent to the Minister of Jus
tice in IS'je it was set forth that I em
! ployed as official agents the private de
i tectives of the Inquiry bureau. I only
. employed a single official agent. What
j led to the belief that I employed private
j agencies was the fact that this agrent
I styled himself a 'business agent' on one
I on his cards, and this was included In the
dossier of the Esterhazy affair."
When Picquart had finished speaking
General Billot Jumped up and asked leave
to speak.
"Picquart," the general called sharply
to the officer, who had just left the stand,
"will you come back?" (Sensation.)
"Certainly," replied Picquart.
General Billot then said: "I am very
pleased that Colonel Picquart has raised
tha question of the secret funds; which â¢
I had already brought before the Court!
of Cassation. The secret funds are secret :
funds, and I should, if I respected the
purpose for which they are assigned, say !
nothing about them. I will endeavor to
say nothing which should remain secret.
The secret funds are placed at the dispo
sition of the Minister of War for the ser
vice of the state, and the Minister has
only to account for them to the President
of the republic. The President controls
and gives his discharge for the secret \
fund. Colonel Picquart received from the j
chief of the general staff tho funds as-
Signed to his department. He could dis
pose of them as he liked, but this the
Minister decides, and with regard to the j
requirement of the service. This distrl- i
button was with the approval Of the Presi- j
dent from the secret funds at his disposal. I
I distributed these f unals . as they have
been distributed for thirty years, before
my advent to power, by all the Ministers of
War. The sum of 3L\<*X) francs monthly
was allowed the chief of the general staff
of the Intelligence department. When th^
credit of 100,000 francs was asked for It '
was for the service of the general staff,
and not for the intelligence department, i
as Colonel Picquart believes. It was
asked for on the report of General de
Boisdeffre (then : chief of the general
staff), and not the report of Colonel Pic- I
quart, for the general service of the se
cret war funds.
"These funds were expended, as Colonel
Picquart stated, SOOO francs by myself,
and, as General Roget said, 20,000 francs
in ISM and 20,000 francs in 1897 by General
Gonse. The remainder was placed at the
disposal of my successor, M- de Freycinet,
who had this sum liquidates by President
Loubet. I will not say another word, but
I must deal with the perfidious insinua
tion made to the Court of Cassation;
which Is calculated to deal ;i blow to the
delicacy, fidelity and honor of the Minis
ter of War."
This statement caused applauso in tne
rear of the court, but Colonel Jouaust cut
the demonstrations short by announcing
adjournment until Monday.
KAISER IS NEUTRAL
IN DREYFUS CASE
BERLIN, Aug. 19.-The second trial by
court-martial of Captain Dreyfus at Ren
nos excited much comment hire this week,
especially the attempt on the life of M.
J,abori and General Mercier's so-called
denouncements. The latter art; not taken
seriously. His statement that Germany j
Was on the point of declaring war with
France in 1594 is ridiculed. The whole
German press IS united on this point. 'The
extreme step which Germany would have i
taken then if President Caslmir-Perler
had not put a stop to the violent attacks ;
on the German embassy would ha-ve been
to send Count yon Minister Ledenburg,
the German Embassador at. Paris, on ,i |
long leave of absence. In no case would i
tho relations of the two Governments j
have assumed a threatening aspect.
The Tageblatt calls General Mercier's
revelations preposterous, and the Frank
fort Zeitung says General Mercier's talk
about Germany meaning war In January,
1H95, has excited only hilarity throughout
Germany.
The Cologne Gazette, calling the present
state, of the French mind "a species of
dementia," says nobody in Germany lakes
General Mercler seriously.
While the energy of the French Govern
ment is generally commented nn favor
ably, doubts are expressed us to whether
it Ik strong enough to overcome the dis
affection in the army.
Emperor William, on receiving the news
of the attempt on the life of M. Labori, |
during the ceremony <>f unveiling the
monument to his grandfather at Arolsen I
on Monday, used strong language in de
nouncing the deed. He said the crime was
evidently part of a regular plot. His
Majesty has kept himself minutely in
formed of the incidents of the trial at
Hcnnes.
The correspondent here of the Associated
FrcÂ«s heard that a proposition, first made i
In the English press and also taken up
by a number of the papers here, for the j
publication of some documents in the
hands of the German Government, calcu
lated to exculpate Dreyfus beyond all
doubt, was seriously broached to the Em
peror find lengthily discussed. Rut he
finally concluded that this would not do
and that he must adhere strictly to vis
system of absolute non-interference. Later
several of the inspired papers expressed j
the same opinion.
PANIZZARDI HAS
THE MADAGASCAR NOTE
VIENNA, Aug. 19.â The Allegemeine
Zeitung says: Colonel Panizzardi,
former military attache of the Italian
embassy at Paris, has the identical note
on Madagascar which is specified in the
bordereau in the Dreyfus affair. It is
in Esterhazy's handwriting and the
paper is similar to that of the bor
dereau.
It was sent to Colonel Sehwarzkop
pen, military attache of the German
embassy, who had it copied. The copy
was sent to Berlin and the original to
Colonel Panizzardi that he might have
a copy. This he did. but he forgot to
return the original to his brother at
tache.
AUSTRIA MAY TAKE
A HAND IN THE GAME
LONDON, Aug. 19.â The Observer
publishes the following dispatch from
Vienna: It is probable that a formal
contradiction of the statements of the
French generals at Rennes regarding
the Schneider letter will be communi
cated to the French Government with
a request that the generals in question
publicly withdraw them.
Such action by Austria-Hungary
â¢would break the ice for the German and
Italian governments.
MERCIER AND ROGET
MAY BE ARRESTED
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â A Sun cable
from Paris says: It is stated that the
Government will cause the arrest of
General Merrier and General Roeret on
the charge of making use of forged
documents in their evidence in the
Rennes court-martial. The report has
caused great excitement.
ABANDONED
VESSEL OFF
VANCOUVER
She Floated Out of the Fog
and Back Into It Like
a Specter.
AN OCEAN MYSTERY
Salvage Parties Could Not Get
Near Enough to Ascertain the
Name of the Barkentine.
Special Dlppatoh to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 19.â According
to a story brought, by the steamer Will
apa, which runs along the west coast of
Vancouver Island, another disaster has
in all probability occurred in that oceans
graveyard where so many wrecks have
taken place. The story as given to the
Willapa'B officers by the residents of
Clayoquot tells of a wandering derelict
barkentine, which came from the smother
that enveloped the Pacific, swung about
among the reefs off Clayoquot Sound,
withâ according to the belief of the resi
dents of Clayoquotâ not a soul on board,
and then, when small boats hurriedly
formed salvage expeditions and went out
to her. drifted with an off-shore wind fill
ing her canvas, back into V*>Â± fog and was
swallowed up, as was the famous phan
tom ship of Captain Vanderdecken.
This was the strange story which all
Clayoquot was talking of when the steam
er wiilapa reached there. According to
her officers, salvage expeditions galore
were being promoted, but as, until the ar
rival of the Wiilapa, the only available
craft with which to salve the derelict
were small boats, the would-be expedi
tions were handicapped.
It was on Sunday last, according to the
story told by the Willapa's officers, that
the barkentine was first seen. She came
out of the fog and drifted in past the
reef, well in shore. She stood right In off
the land and at one time was inside the
breakers off Vangos Island, and had not
the wind shifted she would have then
gone on the rocks. She was blown off a
few miles, however, by a shift of the
wind. Her foretop-gallantmast and miz
zentopmast were gone. Her lower top
sails %vere set, also her mainsail spanker
and three jibs. The foresail was clewed
up but not furled. One man is positive
that her foretopmast was gone, but if her
headsails were set this, of course, would
be impossible. All are agreed on one
point, however, and that is that the bark
entine was evidently abandoned, not a
sign of life being seen anywhere aboard
her.
Numbers of white men went out to her
in boats and many Indians in canoes. The
boats got within a mile of the mysteri
ous stranger and their occupants declare
that everything about the vessel bore evi
dence to the fact that she was deserted.
There was no one at the wheel, the bar
kentine continually Hying up in the wind
and then paying off again as her Jibs
filled. The davits were plainly discerned,
bul . o boats hung from them.
Before the men in the boat could ap
proach any nearer the fog came down,
again like a curtain and it was with con
siderable difficulty that the white men
and 'ndisns regained the shore. Heavy
foÂ«,' hns prevailed along the west coast for
several days past, so much so as to make
a .-(arch for the supposed derelict very
difficult and hazardous.
The fete of her crew, presuming that
they have left her. can only be guessed
at. but there is every reason to hope that
they v.ill have landed safely at some
point along the coast, as the weather has
been tsir lately with the exception of the
fog. She was a small vessel, a barken
tine, with three masts, square-rigged on
the foremastâ a vessel of about 400 or 500
tons.
The only vessels answering- to the de
scription 'that fire in any likelihood of
being in that vicinity so far as known
here are the following: The American
bark ntir.e Katie Flickinger. which left
Pisaguna on June o for this port, and the
American barkentine Leslie I>. which left
San Pedro on July IS for Port Blakeley.
Opinions differ as to whether the bar
kentine was heavily loaded or water
logged. Up t" date she is a marine mys
tery and further news of her will be
eagerly awaited.

STOCKTON*, Aug. 19.â The projectors of
the new railroad to Sacramento will con
vene to-morrow, effect temporary organ
ization and take measures to put the pre
liminary work under way. Those inter
ested are anxious that it be distinctly
j understood that the company is working

On the other hand, it is conceded the
company does not undertake to continue

In this connection it is declared the pur

Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
WASHTN'GTON, Aug. 19. â Secretary

GOOD ACCOMPLISHED
BY PEACE CONGRESS
President WhitÂ© Outlines the Benefits
That Will Accrue to Civilized
Nations.
HAMBURG, Aug. 20.â At the request of i
the correspondent here of the Associated j
Press, Andrew D. White, United States !
Embassador to Germany, who was presi
dent of the American Peace Commission |
at The Hague, has written the following
in regard to the result of the conference:
"In my opinion great good was accom- ;
plished, far more in fact, than any of us â 
d>ired expect, or even hope, when we came
together.
"As to disarmament, everybody really
thinking upon the subject must see that
a good system of arbitration must come
first, and that then when arbitration has
diminished the likelihood of war the ar
guments for cutting down forces and ar
maments is greatly strengthened. The
logical order, then, is lir.st arbitration !
and next disarmament.
"As to the plan of arbitration, any com- i
pulsory system is at present utterly out
of the question. There are so many "inter- ,
national differences Involving questions of i
race, religion and security that there is
not a nation on the face of the earth will- ;
ing to risk an obligatory system. Far bet- !
ter, then, than any is a thoroughly good
system of voluntary arbitration, recourse \
to which public opinion will enforce more
and more, and this, 1 earnestly believe,
the conference has presented to tue
world.
"The great point gained is that whereas j
formerly an arbitration court could only i
be provided after long correspondence be- j
tween Cabinets and negotiations between
Ministers and a thousand other delays.
Just when time was most precious, the j
conference has given to the world an ar
bitration tribunal as an actual and per
manent institution, with Judges, proce
dure, officers of the court, place of meet
ing and accessories all provided.
"It has added as subsidiary to its main
feature carefully systematized plans of
mediation, both general and special, j
which are likely in many cases to prove
exceedingly valuable in preventing na
tions from drifting into war.
"It has also provided a system of com
mission of inquiry by which' the real ques
tions and grievances at issue can be as-

CONGBESS SHOULD STOP THE
WAR AT ONCE.
Defense of Bryan and the Free Silver
Doctrine Before an Assemblage
of Democrats.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Nebr., Aug. 19.â Fully 1000 I
Douglass Democrats, assisted by a j
delegation of about 300 members of the I
Jeffersonian Club of Lancaster County, I
turned out to-day to attend the Jack- j
sonlan Club picnic at Syndicate Park.
Many were accompanied by their fam
ilies, and with the outsiders who came j
to hear the speeches they constituted a
crowd of several thousand. W. J. Bryan j
accompanied the Lancaster County j
delegation. Congressman Champ Clark
of Missouri was the orator of the day.
He declared that the Democratic plat- j
form of 1900 must be the same as that
of 1896. He said:
"The people understand precisely i
what they want. They want the Chi- j
cago platform and they intend to have
It, unchanged, undiluted, unimpaired, j
They will break short off, as you can j
break a piece of glass, the necks of i
those who try to play them false. They
are not in a frame of mind to be fooled j
with."
Mr. Clark declared that the over- !
shadowing issue of 1896 was the ques
tion of free coinage and that it will hold
the same position in 1900.
Regarding the Philippine situation,
he declared that President McKinley
has no policy. He said:
"He is letting things drift, and they
are drifting to the deuce. Meantime '<
our soldiers are being killed and dying
of disease in shoals. For what purpose?
Will anybody undertake to say? I defy
any expansionist to stand up and in
form us whut the President's policy is. !
But some say. and more's the pity and '
shame, some calling themselves Demo
crats, 'The President is wrong; but we ;
must support the President.' To this
has it come at last that we must shut
up our thinkers, close our mouths and
chloroform our consciences In order to
be considered patriots.
"No, if the President is wrong, he I
should be set right. - If he will not j
cease to do wrong, he should be
bounced, as he will be so soon as the j
American people can get a crack at
him.
"In the interim. Congress should re
strain him fmm the further expendi
ture of American blood and American
treasure, in his career of 'criminal ag
gression,' for that is what he himself
defined forcible annexation' to be.
"If he has not sufficient courage, for
titude and strength t<> resist pressure
of the gamblers in human blood and
lives, who arf> holding him on this
evil and ruinous course, the American
people will find a President who has.
His name, too, is Williamâ William
Jennings Bryan of Nebraska."

HAWAIIANS FAVOR REVISION
OF CONTRACT LABOR LAWS
Prominent Citizens and Planters Suggest Remedies
for the Evils Now Existing in the
Islands.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
<T? <T? ONOLULT, Aug. S.â "Are you in j
1 favor of retaining the penal con- !
E tract-labor laws? If not, have i
,j, you any suggestion to make in i
connection therewith to protect
the employers of labor In their Invest- I
ments?
"Have you any suggestions to make In ;
regard to the labor problem of securing j
sufficient labor for the needs of the plan- ;
tat ions and other Industries?"
The best and most representative minds
of Hawaii are now devoting themselves to
a thoughtful consideration of these ques
tions, propounded to them by The I
Some, for personal reasons, decline to
answer, while others feel that their views
will lie valueless in the face of measures
which they believe to be already cut and
dried: hut the great body of thinking men 1
are asking for further time to devise prac- j
tlcal methods, beneficial alike for labor j
and capital.
Following are the views of several prom- j
inent planters and plantation managers,
in addition to those of other representa- !
live men, who are in the main large cap- j
italists but men of liberal views. It is
noticeable that but very few Indorse the ;
penal clauses, but it Is also noticeable that
few think of the ultimate destination of
the islands from the point of view of re- j
placing the immensely preponderating ;
Asiatic population with a class of white 1
peasantry or yeomanry. Patience is the
motto of the hour.
Rev. Alexander Mackintosh, the clergy
man S'j favorably known in connection
with the second congregation Of St. An
drew's (Episcopalian) Cathedral, writes:
"Abolish the penal contra t laws. Fair
wages on a progressive scale will do much ;
to obviate difficulties in the labor marnet. I
From what 1 have seen in the importation
of white labor I think the planters had .
bett< r stick to Asiatics."
Hon. William Nevins Armstrong, w,ho
held high office under King Kalakaua, Has
a Labor Commissioner, and is now
editor of the Pacific Commercial Adver- j
tiser, writes:
"j am not in favor of retaining the penal
contract-labor laws, and suggest the of- â¢
ferine of contracts for the raising of
and the giving of fee-simple homes
to laborers, with some restrictions."
Robert YV. Wilcox, surveyor and real
'state agent. th>' Hawaiian whose name j
has been prominent more than once in \
revolutionary attempts, writes;
"No, because it is a slavery. The pro
â  for the employers of labor in their
investment is to follow tho laws of the [
free laborers of the United States. The |
only suggestion, in my opinion, is to get â

obtain them the planters must abandon
the slavery system and Improve the whole
system according to the American system
of free laborers."
Colonel W. F. Allen, whose name is 1
known to all who know Hawaii, a bust- |
ness agent, says:
"No. From the few experiments that j
are being tried It would seem as if the co- I
operative plan, for the laborer to be in
terested In the success of his labor, would
in a measure help to solve the question." :
James T. Copeland, officer of the G. A.
K. Post and master builder, writes:
"Emphatically, no. 1 would suggest a
limited time in which to do away with
the present contract-labor laws, thereby
giving the planters an opportunity to
adapt their business, corps of laborers.
etc, to the new laws. I ttiink two years'
time would be amply sufficient to effect
the change."

ASTORIA, Aug. 19.-ThÂ© first day
of Astoria's sixth annual carnival of land
and water sports opened this morning, the
programme being the championship ath
letic games of the Pacific Northwest As

Ing, and the Tacoma Young Men's I'hris
tlan Association was first in the one-mile
walk.
Last night the crowds began arrivng j
and hundreds of visitors came to the city I
on every train and boat. By morning !
there were at least 7000 strangers in town, j
The business houses and residences were
handsomely decorated and the city pre- |
Rented a lively appearance. Thousands
will come to-morrow and on Monday
morning, and It is expected that fully
20.000 persons will be here from outside
points to see the lirst day's sailing and
rowing races.
In the opening event of the champion- j
ship programme, a 100-yard dash there
were ten entries, but owing to the pres- I
ence of (Jeorge Paris, the colored wonder !
from the Seattle Athletic Club, half of
the intending competitors were fright
ened out. Paris was an easy winner,

"I do not favor penal contracts and T dc 1
not see why the general laws that fjov- !
crn contracts cannot be applied to these." j
Joseph M. Poepoe. Hawaiian, attorney
and editor of the Hawaiian newspaper
Kuokoa, says:
"To repeal the penal contract-labor laws 1
means ruin to very many of our m w
plantations. Labor laws now In force In !
Ilawaii can be modified by local legisla- i
lion so as to give them a better working i
force upon the laborers without resorting \
to penal servitude, ("heap labor has been 1
the mainstay of nur plantations. If our |
plantations can obtain cheap labor from
the I'nited States or Europe get It or ei.se i
thoy cannot escape from obtaining It from ;
places other than the I'nited States Or
Europe."
S. C. Allen of the great lumber firm of
Allen & Robinson writes:
"I am of the opinion that as the Ameri
can Government has possession of these
Islands and Congress will meet in a few !
months to arrangti the form of govern- i

to make any Mipecsuiuns or give an npln- j
lon on the matt* r."
Dr. N. B, Emerson, whnso name is wide
ly known beyond the confines of Hawaii,
writes:
"It seems to me that the ponnl element
in our contract laws had better be abol
ished. T believe that the observance on
the pnrt of the employer of strict Justice j
and kindneFS toward the emr>lÂ«ye, the !
avoidance of the system nf advances' '
and not permlting the employe to go Into ;
debt, will be of service In defending the,
interests of the employer. I believe that 1
the system of 'profit sharing' has in it |
elements of equity which make It deslr
able that it should he used as an Induce
ment to the coming In of a better class
of laborers. Every effort should he madp
apt our methods to the employment
of a class of intelligent laborers and
pn ru-sharers on our plantations. It
would b< a ereat gain on the part of the
employer if nil those Interested in thÂ»* em- i
ployment of labor in this country were]
to enter Into tin agreement by which j
share-laborers who broke contracts or j
Otherwise sqflffht to defraud their employ
ers were denied employment nn other

satisfied all just cinims against them."
.1. C. Quinn, president of the United Car- |
ria^re Company and Livery Stables and \
one of the most prominent of local prac
tical politicians In the "good old days,"
writes:
"It does not matter whether we are In
favor or not of retaining the penal con- I
tra<M labor laws. Slavery was abolished j
in the I'nited States years ago, and now j
that we are part and parcel of the I'nlted
States it is impossible for slavery to ex
ist here. The labor problem Is a wry
grave one, but 1 think It will turn out
all right. The people will have to ie !;>

office they were Hawaiians, but when
they got into trouble they were Amen

from 20 to 80 per cent. They will have to !
pay more wages and get less dividends.
Plantations can afford to pay treble what
they are paying at present, and then net
a handsome income. Every Industry on
the Islands depends upon sugar. Lawyers,
doctors, merchants and mechanics are <n
rently or Indirectly dependent on sugar,
but l" think we will, like the widow, prove
equal to the occasion."
C. H. Parker, a master mechanic of
many years' residence, wrli-s:
"The penal contract-labor laws should
not be retained; I think the system of
cultivating on shares a good one if prop
erly applied and fairly carried out. These
would be no trouble In the quality and
quantity of Labor if the share system
were properly introduced and carried
out."
Hon. Paul R. Isenberg, who modestly
terms himself a rancher, writes:
"I am not In favor of retaining the

wagefl are paid I think we can get all the
labor we want."
Robert Hall, manager of Niuill Planta
tion, writes:
"I am not in favor of and have consid
ered the contract system as a necessary
evil. I desire to see a moderate and steady
inflow of labor, free or assisted, to main

Astoria Football Club third. This is a
new Northwest record for 100 yards. The
4-10-yard race was a hollow victory for
Paris, who negotiated the distance In
53 2-5 seconds, f For second place there was
a pretty struggle between Blumenthal of
the Multnomahs and Thayer of the Uni
versity of Washington, resulting in a dead
heat.- This was run off later in the day
and was won by the former. The 220-yard
race also fell to Paris, who scarcely got
exercise In reaching the tape in -1 4-5.
Palmer, also of the Seattle Club, was sec
ond and Dammasch of the Multnomahfl
third.
The SSO-yard race, although not fast.
was an exciting contest, the first three
menâ Bader and Elder of Seattle and Blu
menthal of Multnomahâ finishing in the
order named 'and being separated by not
more than a yard. â¢ The time was 2:07 1-5.

In the hurdles Morgan of the Multno
mahs was an easy victor, winning the
120-yards in 17 seconds and the 220-yards
In 30 seconds.
The pole-vaulting contest was perhaps
the most exciting feature of the day. The
real struggle for supremacy was confined
to T. J. Hume of the Seattle Athletic
Club and R. Heater of the Multnomahs
of Portland. The medal was awarded to
R. Heater, who cleared the bar at 10 feet
10 inches, thereby establishing a new rec
ord for the Pacific Northwest.
The high jump was won by Trenkman
of the Multnomahs. Height, 5 feet 11

the hammer throw, with Saundera of
Multnomah second. Distance 100 feet 10

Young Men's Christian Association won
the discus event, with a throw of 10 feet,
Saunders second, Thayer third.
Palmer of Seattle won the broad Jump
with 19 feet 5 Inches, Heater of Multno
mah second.
The one-mile walk resolved itself Into
a five-lap run. The opposing candidates
were J. F. Huffman or the Multnomah
team and R. A. B. Young of the Taeoma
Young Men's Christian Association. The
result was claimed as a dead heat by
some of the Multnomah men, but tho
judges awarded the llrst place to Young.
Huffman fell exhausted at the finish and
only recovered after several minutes.
The last event was a mile relay, which,
after an exciting contest, was won by
Seattle, bringing the points scored by that
club Up to 50, Multnomah placed 4G to its
credit; the Seattle Young Men's Christian

Fred H. Hayselden, stock raiser and
planter of Lanai, writes:
"I am in favor of a contract labor law
without the penal clause and would sug
pesi that a percentage of the wages of the
laborer he retained to reimburse the em
ployer for any loes owing tv the failure
of the laborer to fullfill his contract, the
matter to be decided through the courts

"I think we shall have to depend upon

could the cost would be too high for the

A well-known planter in Hawaii who
prefers to withhold his name writes:
"No. Penal contracts do not obtain on
the mainland, where billions of capital are
invested in enterprises. The worklngman

"I am in i'avor of a contract labor law
without a penal clause. As the woeful
meaning of our present contracts as In
terpretdd by some spiteful writers, al
though not a word of truth In them, yet
their writings are so extensively circu
lated that they will always count against
us; hence 1 would strike It out and stop
their grumbling and their holding us up
to the world as â grasping, <Â»UÂ«, uÂ£
Christian slave-drivers. 1 I would strike
it out for that reason and have peace In
the family. Besides, I don't see as our
penal clause, as now administered, is of
any practical value, as it neither prevents
desi 1 lion nor returns deserters only in ex-
I heliftve as many desert now
as would desert if the penal clause did not
exist As laborers are not all dishonest

and "dissipated, who run away not because
they are abused by the planters but run
away in.m their d#Dta and their disgraco.
The other nine-tenths have the same op
portunity to flesart as the one-tenth, but
they are' too honest to do that, lhey bar
gained to work a certain time and they
are determined to work it out honestly.
Then they can go with their heads up and
their certified honestly filled contracts in
their pockets. This they value as it in
proof of their honesty. We had a Japa
nese who deserted and was gone a year.
His conscience or some other power pre
vailed on him to return and work out his
contract, which he did voluntarily and
faithfully. It 1b hoped we may be permit
ted to make contracts with our laborers
for six months, one year or three years,
as the case may be. In the States farmers
are permitted to contract with a laborer
for work, and they are held by bond*
more firmly to fill their contracts than
they could be by a penal clause: These
laborers are very particular to fill their
contracts honestly, knowing that should
they desert without good cause they
would not get another job In that tWlÃh
borbOdd, as every employer in that dis
trict would hear of it and refuse to hire
them This course worked well there I
never knew a laborer there to abandon
his contract. The same principle will work
here if intelligently inaugurated, in fact,
it is already working, undoubtedly it vas
the honest desire of the nine-tenths above
referred to to fill their contracts honestly
and not its penal clause that kept them
from deserting. If all employers refused
to hire a laborer unless he produced a
certificate of discharge from his last em
ployer there would be few deserters. This
WOUld have a tendency to make honesty
the best policy and be wiser and sound
more humane than penal contracts, and
] believe more effective. I have this ulse
to If our present and future Gov
â¢ mment will BO favor our industries a*
to permit them to get labor where it is
to be had, thtn there will be no check to
our material prosperity, but if our Gov
ernment continues its present DOlldv of
refusing to permit the Importation of la
bor from Asia unless a certain per cent of
Europeans or Americans are aho im
ported and do no! let It bo known where
and how they can be obtained, then a
dark cloud overshadows our industries,
although prospects are bright but for this
dark shadow."

LOR ANGELES, Aug. 19.â The Califor

which has for several months been op

connection with the Santa Fe system, has
found the trade so profitable that two
more steamers are to be at once added to
the present service, making a fleet of five
vessels In the trade. In an Interview to
day General Freight Agent Chambers
said:
"The owners of the California and Ori

passenger service to Oriental ports. The
plans for this purpose are now nearly ma

be extended direct to Manila, although
that will be done asÂ» soon as conditions

BERLIN, Aug. 19.â An interesting
! feature of Germany's foreign policy is
! the strong rapprochement with the
j Netherlands and Belgium. The ad
j vances came from the smaller States.
! This rapprochement has made steady
i headway for some time past. The Min
j inster of the Netherlands here recently
i submitted the draft of a regular treaty
I to tho German Minister of Foreign Af
-1 fairs, Count yon Bulow. Definite ac
tion has not yet been taken, but it is a
positive fact that negotiations to that
j end are now under way. Some of the
\ Dutch newspapers, In pointing out the
! need of such a treaty, express fears of
I the United States seizing the Dutch
j colonies in Asia and the West Indies.
, The German press talk favorably of the
i project, except the pan-German organs
I and rabidly Jingo papers, which ex
press the belief that Holland and her
colonies will some day drop into Ger
many's Jaws, anyway.
The draft of the new Samoan act
j published here is substantially as it
1 appears in America. The correspond
! ent of the Associated Press learns that
I Germany will unquestionably ratify the
' work of the commission, although
I neither Emperor William nor Count
I yon Bulow is quite satisfied, consider
i ing that German interests are not ade
! quately protected by the wording of the
j new act.
Several of the most serious and influ
i ential papers, including the National
j Zeitung and the Frankfort Zeitung.
j printed strong editorials this week on
: the relations of "Germany with the
United States, vigorously reeommend
| Ing thu acceptance of invitations to the
I Philadelphia commercial exhibition. In
I connection with this matter, it is in
teresting to note that the Government
1 is imitating Philadelphia in planning
an imperial commercial museum of its

While at Remscheid this week the
: Emperor made several characteristic
; remarks. To a little buy to whom his
j father intrusted a bouquet for his Ihs
; jesty, and which the little fellow was
I loth to relinquish, his Majesty said:
"Yes, what a German once has, he likes
to keep."
Considerable surprise was excited in
! Berlin when it became known that the
j Emperor would not be present at the
unveiling on Monday of the statue to
; Frederick the Great in the Sieges Allee,
although he had always declared Fred
; crick was his model, and in view of the
! fact that he did not have anything im
| portant for that date. Still, the Em
| peror prefers to go to the military pa
i rade at Mayence.
Prince Henry of Prussia will return

work tn a number of small ofiieials of

nies in East Africa under two and a
; half years' contracts. Simple copying
clerks are also vainly sought for at
i 7500 marks salary. The agrarian pa
' pers have published the last alleged
! dividends of two German branches of
I the Standard Oil Company as being
! 66Vi'per cent and 47 per cent, and the
1 papers demand that the Government
put a stop to "such bleeding of the

A former secretary of the Russian

SALINAS, Aug. 19.â A terrible accident,
I whether through carelessness or gross ig

! Jen near Castrovllle last night. Tietjen.
! who had been a brakeman in the employ
lof the Southern Pacific for over nine
I years, was engaged in making up the
{ north bound freight train at Castrovllle.
I Several cars were switched off to a side
i track, on which were other cars. Tietjen
was either riding on the bumper or run
ning ahead of a car when two sections
i came together with great force, breaking
I the bumpers and pinning Tietjen between
! them.
His peril was seen by fellow-trainmen
j who signaled the engineer to go ahead.
The train moved ahead about five feet
and then suddenly hacked, catching the
unfortunate man and crushing him ter
ribly. When he was extricated life was
extinct.
Tietjen was a German by birth, a resi
! dent of San Francisco, near Valencia and
I Fifteenth streets, and leaves a widow and

CEDES TO POPULAR DEMAND.
â¦
Objectionable Pasteboards Were Be
called and Others Without the
Picture of the Admiral Is
sued in Their Place.
Special Dispatch to Tfce Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â Admiral
George Dewey's picture has been
turned to the wall by the managers of
j the projected outing of the United
j Democratic Clubs of the borough of
Queens to Ridgewood on Monday next,
' because it was said that the admiral
had expressed admiration for McKinley
and a desire for his re-election.
Several thousand tickets were issued
for the occasion, bearing an excellent
wreathed portrait of Admiral Dewey.
When they began to circulate through
Rockaway Beach members of the Dem
ocratic Club in that ward objected to
the picture, contending that the ad
miral was not a Democrat, as they said
I that they had read in the papers that
I he expressed a high regard for Presi
i dent McKinley and a desire to see him
I re-elected.
Demands on the outing committee to
recall the Dewey tickets and have
others printed without the admiral's
! picture followed the persistent circula
j tion of the story.
What arguments were used Is not
' definitely known, but the committee
I was induced to make the change de
manded. More than 1500 of the Dewey
tickets had^been sold when word was
I sent to various clubs throughout the
i borough that the first Issue would be
1 recalled. All unsold tickets were turn
! Ed in and duplicates without the ad
miral's picture were substituted, while
purchasers of Dewey tickets were told
I that they could exchange their Dewey
j tickets at different headquarters fur
the official ticket.
A careful comparison of two kinds of
tickets shows that their only difference
is the presence of the admiral** picture
! on the first and its absence from the
! second. Some of the old-time Dcmn
| crats object to the change, urging that
Dewey belongs to no party, but to the
people.
QUARANTINE COMPLAINTS
j Chamber of Commerce "Writes
to Secretary Gnqe on Lack
of Facilities.
1 Several weeks ago, when one of the large
I Oriental steamers was in quarantine hi
I tho Angel Island station, BeriOUS cmi
! p'air.t was Qade of the lack >; accoinmo
' dation and the great Inconvenience to
'which nearly all of the passengers were
put. This matter was taken up by the
I chamber of Commerce, and yesterday the
following letter was forwarded to Secre
tary of the Treasury Gage by Mr. ricott,
secretary of the local chamber:
Sir: We respectfully beg to call your
attention to the quarantine station
erected at Angel Island, bay of San
Francisco. With a thorough apprecia
tion of the plant already tnere and the
good work accomplished, we neverthe
less feel that a great deal still re-
I mans to be done to place it in the con-
I dition necessary for the requirements
of our principal port upon the Pacific
and the gateway to the Orient. The
present facilities are inadequate even
when only one ship is held in quaran
tine ami flight en
shore. When we consider, however,
the greatly increased trade of this
port with Oriental countries, neces
sarily resulting in many more vessels
arriving from those points, not to
speak of the large number of Govern
ment transports continually coming', it
will readily be seen that additional
Improvements are imperatively re
quired. Among the munt important we
mention:
Firstâ An ample water supply, the
(â r< Bent quantity being entirely insuf
ficient tor â¢ yen a small number of pas
sengers, abundance of water being an
absolute necessity in such a plant.
Secondâ Additions to the buildings for
the accommodation of cabin pas*
gfrp. On the last trip of the Nippon
Maru to this pert, although the only
vessel in quarantine at that time, 'he
' ibjn passengers, though not many in
number, were subjected to great In
convenience by being crowded to
gethtr. owing to the limited a< mmr
dations. If it had happened, as is likely
to be the caw at any time, that several
otli. r vesi ela wi ; â  it w.i ii.i
r< adlly be seen to what extreme di*
mmfort they would be sttb-Jectfld.
Thirdâ To facilitate the transfer of
passengers and baggage Â» substantial
iron jiier i= badly needed In order that
the steamers may lie alongside and do
away with the Bervice of lighters and
tugs. Commending the above sugges
tions to your courteous consideration,
w.* have the honor to subscribe o>.r

AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. 19.â situation
In the orange lumber district of Texas
la extremely critical, and according to pri
vate advices that were received here to
day a bloody race war Is imminent, de
spite the presence of a troop of State cav
alry and a detachment of State rr ngers,
â¢who arrived at the town of Orange to-day,
bÂ«lng ordered there by Governor Savers.
The serious nature of the trout ie is be
lr.K suppressed as much as p ssible by
the business men of that section.
A telegram was received here late last
r.!ght stating that the town of Orange is
virtually in the hands of a mob; that
"whltecap" organizations have warned
all negroes In that town and surrounding i
eections to leave on penalty of being killed
If they disobey the order. Hundreds of !
negroes have already left, and if the exo- ]
dus continues the whole negro population â¢
Will have departed by to-morrow night.
The "whltecaps" have killed one negro
end seriously wounded two others. They
have sent notices to all of the lumber
mill men warning them tTiat they will
be killed if they employ negro labor.
Borne of tho largest mills have already
Bhut down; others will attempt to run un
der the protection of the militia and
rangers.
The better class of white citizens or
Orange and in the lumber camps of that
region are endeavoring to restore quiet
and prevent further killings. Governor
Payers to-day offered a reward of $200 in
each caFe for the arrest and conviction of
the members of the mob who are killing \
and intimidating the negroes.
MINIATURE CYCLONF
DOES SOME DAMAGE
Outbuildings Wrecked and Trees
Stripped of Their Fruit
Near Los Gatos.
LOS GATOS, Aug. 19.â The Novitiate of
the Sacred Heart, situated in the hills a
Quarter of a mile above Los Gatos, was
visited by a miniature cyclone on Tues
day. It was first seen in its inception at
a large cak tree fifty feet from the main
entrance Â«to the novitiate and at the far
ther end of a large plateau. Following a
northeasterly direction in its course of
destruction, it spent its fury for a time in
a row of gum trees in a. deep gulch below
the novitiate, stripping trees and carrying
branches a hundred feet into the air. Re
turning in almost a circular direction, it
ewe-pt over the entire front of the college
building, carrying away wifh terrific force
all loose dirt and gravel. Again following
a northerly direction and reaching the ad
joining ranch owned by \Y. O. Johnson, It
EP<=-nt its fury.
Johnson, who was at work in his or
chard, seeing the cycione approaching.
Bought shelter. He had hardly reached
his house when a shed fourteen feet
srjuare. newly built, was struck and car
ried off. It was found next day a quar
ter of a mile away, fit only for firewood.
The tornado stripped his prune trees of
fruit and carried everything- portable up
tr.tn the air over a hundred feet. .
The inception and progress of the cy- I
clone was witnessed by the fathers and !
â brothers of the novitiate and by the fol
lowing visitors who happened to be pres
ent at the time: W. Flynn of Dublin, Ire
land; Professor John Leonard of Santa
Clara College. J. Montgomery, a noted in
ventor, Mrs. Mary Brazil of San Francis
co and Mr. Mullin of Los Gatos.

P.EDLANDS. Aug. 19.â shooting
of Charles Hawley by Night Watchman
Walker this evening has thrown Red
lands into such excitement as has not
prevailed here in years. Armed with
warrants Night Watchman Walker,
Constable Rivera and the City Marshal,
proceeded to search a resort conducted
on East State street by Ed Daniels,
where it was alleged Daniels had been
selling intoxicating liquors contrary to
the city ordinance. Daniels became
aware of the intentions of the officers
and upon their approach ran to the
Club stables, on East State street, or
dered a rig and driver and left the city,
Night Watchman Walker pursuing on
a bicycle.
Overtaking the rig about two miles
west of this city, on Brookside avenue,
Walker commanded Daniels to stop,
but he did not obey. Then Walker fired.
Hawley, the driver, fell to the bottom
of the buggy. Daniels took the lines
and continued the flight.
Walker then entered the buggy of
William Michaels, who was following
the chase. They continued after Dan
iels, but their horse was not speedy
enough. Losing sight of the fleeing
pair, they were compelled to give up
the chase, which was continued by
Constable Rivera, who had arrived on
the scene.
When about six miles west of this
city they found Hawley and the rig at
a farmhouse, where Daniels had aban
doned them and continued on across
country on foot.
Rivera brought Hawley to this city.
Physicians were summoned and a
hasty examination disclosed the fact
that he was shot in the back of the
head just above the right ear, the ball
passing through the brain, emerging
at the right temple. Hawley will not
live twenty-four hours.
A warrant has been issued for
Walker and he will be placed under ar
rest and confined in jail for safe-keep
ing. There is strong talk by citizens of
lynching Walker, for they maintain he
had no right to shoot Hawley.
Officers are in hot pursuit of Daniels,
and it is thought he will be captured
soon.

FOR A SPECIAL RACE.
The Stake Races Have Attracted
Twenty Per Cent More Entries
Than Last Year â Success
ful Meeting Assured.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 19.â At ameetlng of
; the board of directors of the State Agri
: cultural Society this afternoon privileges
] at the State Fair were sold for a much
larger amount than last year. A year ago
! the betting privilege at the track sold for
, $12,000. This year it sold for $17,762 50. the
successful bidder being B. W. Cavanaugh,
a well-known politician and bookmaker of
; Sacramento. The other bid was from
, Humphrey & Schwartz, but it was under
j stood that several San Francisco sporting
men were interested in the firm. The
: amount of their bid was $17,300. Last year
! the programme privilege brought $504.
Thi= year Senator Frank W. Leavitt paid
$825 tor it. There were two other bidders
. for tho programme. Chase & Mendenhall
offering $560 and J. C. Langenderfer $604.
I Both privileges sold for an unusually
i large amount of money. This is attributed
i to the fact that the bidders felt assured
1 that the coming fair will be one of the
most Buccessful ever held in Sacramento.
Th<- management has put forth every ef
fort to give the visiting public the worth
of their money, and the fact is so well
known that there is small doubt that Sac
ramento will be filled with strangers on
â lay of the two weeks' meeting.
Mr. cavanaugh, who received the bet
. ting privilege, has offered $500 additional
for a special race to be run on Sacra
! mr-ntn day. the race to be named by the
' president of the Agricultural Society
1 This year there are 20 per cent more en
tries in the stakes than there were last
year, and demands have been mad* for
stalls for more than 250 runners. A car
; load of horses arrived unexpectedly from
Montana this week, and another is on the
way. The directors have offered two ad- ;
ditlonal trotting purses, one of $500 for 'â

19 the election of a permanent chairman
| and secretary, and Sheldon Q. Kellogg
of the Forty-first District and James A.
Wilson of the Thirty-sixth were declared
the caucus delegates for those positions.
After the election the convention is to be
! adjourned; unless in the next three days
j some unlooked-for change la made.
This programme was not decided upon
without a right. There were many in the
caucus who held out for proportionate
representation. They claimed that In the
districts in which Kelly and Crimmins
won they should be allowed to name their
committeemen. Delegates from the Thir-
I ty-sixth and Thirty-seventh were partic
j ularly emphatic in voicing this opinion,
and the argument that resulted and thÂ«
subsequent vote so incensed the delegates
from the Thirty-sixth that they bolted
I the caucus and left the hall vowing ven
i geance. It was the Dod^e programme
J that won out, and notwitnstanding the
I deflection of the Tiirty-sixth. the Dodge
programme was the unanimous choice of
â  the caucus; the bosses lost on their iast
i hope, and although It was midnight when
the meeting broke up and a good bit of
wrangling had ensued, it was as harmoni-
I ous and unanimous a body and as strong
' ly resolved against boss rule as when it
first went into the fight.
The first important action of the dele
gates assembled was to agree upon cau
: cus rules. The meeting was called as a
j conference, but the spirit of unanimity
was so pronounced from the beginning
that caucus was agreed upon. The dis
cussion of the evening was precipitated
by the following resolution:
Whereas. At a. Joint conference of the ex
ecutive committee of the Central Republican
Commute? and the chairmen of the several dis
trict delegations held Aug-uat IT, lSl*3, resolu
tions were adopted whereby a plan for the
formation of a county committee was
formulated; and whereas. Bald resolu
tions provided that each district be
represented in said county committee by
four representative?, and that the Central Re
publican Committee be empowered to appoint
eighteen representatives at large; and whereas,
by said resolutions the districts represented In
the coming municipal convention by City Re
publican League delegates were allowed to
select their own representatives In said County
("'â mmlttee, while such districts as failed to
elect City Republican League delegates were
to be considered vacancies to be filled by a
committee of five appointed by the chairman
of the executive committee of the Central Re
publican Committee of the City Republican
Leagues, whose work is to be subsequently in
dorsed by the caucus, now, therefore, be It
Resolved, That this caucus fully Indorse*
the action of the joint conference.
Charles Nagle of the Thirty-sixth imme
diately moved as a substitute that each
district be represented in the committee
by members selected by the delegates who
won out. Then began the wrangle. The
members of the Thirty-sixth and Thirty
seventh backed Nagle strongly. They ar
gued from every point for proportional
representation, but were beaten out in the
end. The Dodge people won, and the
Thirty-sixth walked out In a huff.
Zenas Dodge, as chairman, called the
meeting to order, and Sheldon Kellogg
was elected temporary chairman and
George W. Lewis secretary. The chair
man of each delegation will submit the
names of three delegates, and from them
the committee will select the members of
the committees on credentials and perma
nent organization and order of business.
Wednesday's convention, according to
programme, will be adjourned as soon as
the chairman and secretary are elected.
The committee will not be elected umil

THE EXTRA SESSION SCHEME.
SUFFICIENT evidence has now been collected
and published by The Call to make it clear that
c and Burns and Herrin are not spending
the holidays in pursuit of health, nor in considering
the welfare of the State. They have been diligently
ng members of the Legislature to find out
whether an extra Session would result in an election
in Burns to the United States Senate.
An extra session will cost the State a great deal of
It will impose further burdens upon the tax
. and the diversion of money will prevent the
. icing of many needed improvements. The
people will ask what is to be gained by such expen
diture of public funds, and of course some answer
will be given. The call for an extra session will-de
clare certain legislation to be of pressing importance,
and the legislators will be summoned together to con
sider it. The real intent of the call, however, will be
to bring about the election of the man to whom Gage
and Herrin arc committed, no matter what it may
the silent, secret work that has been going on
j the conspirators during the summer the one
has been to find members of the Legislature
who agree to vote for Burns if an extra session be
summoned. Should a majority be found for him we
shall have the extra session and the taxpayers will
have to stand the burden. Should there be no such
sight, Governor Gage will find no legis-
Intion 1 .; urgency at this time, and there will
be no extra session.
It is not strange the conspirators should be willing
to take big ri~ks. The complete rout of the Burns
push at the Republican primaries in this city the
Â«"thef day shows his power is at an end in San Fran
. isco politics. He desires to go to the United States
Senate, and it is a case of now or never with him.
He will not again have such a gang in the Legisla
ture as he has in this one, no matter what else may
â n.
Gage is on all fours with Burns in the scheme. He
has nothing to lose by it, for he has no prospect of
ever getting office again in California. All the profit
lie is to derive from politics must be obtained now.
It will matter little to him if the people denounce an
extra session in addition to the other of his acts they
already denounce. He has had experience and he
knows that a man may just as well be convicted for
stealing a sheep a* for a lamb.
Herrin is in much the same condition. He has
made a blunder of the business of running railroad
politics, and he, too, must achieve a victory in order
to retain the favor of Huntington. He has openly de
clared Burns to be the railroad candidate, and Hun
tington has publicly snubbed him by denying that the
railroad has a candidate. Thus Herrin must win out.
or there may be a vacancy in the Southern Pacific law
lent.
Here we have three rats in the pit with only one
way to get out. With them it is this Legislature or
nothing. Fortunately, the people understand the sit
uation and are on guard. An extra Burns se-sinn
will mean political ruin for any and every man who
votes for the Mexican, and the ruin would be poorly
by anything that could be done for that man
by either Burns. Gage or Herrin.

A GOVERNOR IN DIFFICULTY.
GOVERNOR THOMAS of Colorado is in dif
ficulties that would be novel in any other
State.
: He is what is called in Ireland "on his kaping," be
cause of the fury of a female citizen voter and lady of
creation in that altitudinous commonwealth. His office
â¢I has been guarded and his entrances and his exits have
j been furtive and stealthy. He would walk backward
â¢ to see who is behind him, except that then somebody
I might still get in the rear by getting in front of him.
He has come to San Francisco to meet the Colorado
I troops on their return from the wars, %ut the train
J crews were timid about hauling him. and even the
i engine was afraid of getting its eye put out. Since
the Mormons beset Governor Boggs of Missouri and
pumped lead into him no American executive has had
to. mind his uprisings and his downsittings as carefully
as this invested and besieged official.
j The lady in the case has a husband in the peni
j tentiary. It is her fad to have him pardoned, and the
j Governor has turned a deaf ear to her prayer. After
! exhausting her powers of persuasion in vain, she has
I put her feet in the warpath and refuses to turn -back.
Her desire is to. throw vitriol in the Governor's face
! as evidence of her disapproval of his official stub
! bornness. Vitriol is not a cosmetic in general use in
â¢ Colorado, and the Governor protests that there are
. other liquids used as a carminative which he prefers
to this corrosive fluid, which gnaweth like a worm
and leaves its record permanently embossed on the
I cuticle. It is the crisis of his life. But as it is a
female crisis he can't fire at it.
The case brings to the front an interesting phase
'of female psychology. The infuriated lady's husband
! is in prison for beating her into a merchantable jelly.
When the ballot. was gallantly extended to the ladies
c f Colorado they invaded the Legislature and pro
ceeded to reform the laws which the brute man had
theretofore pa : ssed in his own interest and to carry out
. his coarse and pestilential instincts. The first reform
I was. to make wife-beating a penitentiary offense.
"The man who lays his hand upon a woman, save
in the way of kindness, is a wretch whom it is base
flattery to call a coward," cried the lady legislators,
with Claude Melnotte, and thereupon proceeded to
do for such wretches by an act entitled an act which
puts them in stripes and durance for five years.
The lady in this case was the first to feel the heavy
i hand of conjugal correction after the law was passed,
and in her dudgeon she invoked the statute and sent
1 her life partner up to expiate and repent.
He had hardly got used to his new clothes and
I shaved head before she wanted him back, and her
want has grown into a fine frenzy. The Governor
jis a politician. He keeps one eye upon the female
vote and seems to be in fear that the ladies who have
not yet been whipped by their husbands -will resent
at the polls his pardon of this wife-beater.
But the lady wants her husband, and has given the
! Governor. his choice between losing the female vote
i or parting with that manly beauty which heretofore
! has been his best stage property in politics.
What seems to be needed in Colorado is a lady for
I Governor. Then such an issue as this would be set
tled by a hat-drawing match and not by vitriol.
The case will arouse widespread sympathy for
i Governor Thomas and will cause a thoughtful state
about reformed legislation.
As a rule. the ladies whose husbands admonish them
with a chair or knock them down with their fists re
sent outside interference. The sentiment of females
who are under that sort of discipline was expressed by
the one whose friend found her weeping salt tear* out
of two freshly blacked eyes, and said, "He's been
I whippin' ye agin, Nora." "Vis; but it's not that
' makes me cry. Poor Pat'll not live long. He's get- i
! tin' weak, for he don't strike me near as hard as he
used to." We hope that Governor Gage will assure
the Governor of Colorado that every* protection shall !
Ibe extended to him in California. Unless there is a
j regular society of women who avenge themselves on
! Governors that refuse pardon to wife-beaters Gov
ernor Thomas will be safe here. It is true that his
Colorado Nemesis in skirts may disguise herself as a
man and get a squirt at him, but every care will be
I taken to prevent this.
California intends to protect visiting Governors.
So far nothing worse has happened to them than a
speech by Mr. dc Young, and there is a general dis- j
; position here to prevent things going from bad to I
worse.
The investigating committee of the Alumni Asso
ciation of the San Jose Normal School seems to have
committed a fatal blunder in appealing to Governor
Gape to set aside the verdict in the case of Dr. Mc-
Naughton. The committee should have directed its
attention to the source of gubernatorial authority.
The appeal should have been made to Burns.
STRIKES AND PROSPERITY.
HARDLY had the great strike in Brooklyn fin
ished its course when another occurred in
Cleveland, and now, just as that is about to be
settled, the report conies that a strike of the brick
makers in Cook County, Illinois, has stopped work
on 200 buildings in Chicago and thrown upward of
10.000 workmen out of employment.
These occurrences are not of a surprising nature.
It has long been known to students of sociology that
strikes follow prosperity just as certainly as over
speculation follows it. Were this not so, the advance
of the world in material wealth would go on with a
continually augmenting force and rapidity. Human
nature is so constituted, however, that when once
flushed with success it is never content. It reaches
out eagerly for more, and too often, like the dog in
the fable, drops the substance in an eftort to grasp
the shadow.
During the depression of the second term of Cleve
land, when the Democratic tariff left the industries of
the nation exposed to the ruinous competition of the
cheap labor of Europe, there were no strikes and very
few speculative ventures. Capitalists were then well
pleased to obtain any profit at all from their invest
ments and workingmen were only too glad to find
work at good wages. No considerable number of
people were tempted to hazard anything on a strike
or a speculation. All the industries of the people
were carried on with extreme conservatism, and labor
and capital were too glad to be able to co-operate to
give any" heed whatever to agitators who sought to
stir up strife between them.
Two years of prosperity have brought about the
seemingly inevitable results. Speculation in industrial
stocks has reached a point that verges on madness,
and strikes follow one another with a rapidity, almost
unparalleled. These of course will tend to check
prosperity. They are in the nature of brakes applied
to the wheels of progress, and will prevent it from
going forward with anything like the momentum it
would otherwise have.
These things are but manifestations on a large scale
of the course which Franklin noted in the case of
familiesâ work begets money, money begets pride,
pride begets extravagance, extravagance begets pov
erty, poverty begets work and work begets money
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 20, IS9J>.
again, and so the endless revolution goes on. We
have once. more reached the point where the mass of
the people wax fat and kick.
These are some of the effects of prosperity. For
tunately, while they check, they cannot hinder
progress. They cause local disturbances, and in the
future as in the past may bring about a great national
depression, but they never wholly stop the forward
movement of civilization. It is of course to be re
gretted they occur, but it is better to have strikes and
speculations with prosperity than to have the con
servatism of depressions.
THE OPENING IN KENTUCKY.
AFTER Altgeld broke the profane silence which
had brooded over the Kentucky campaign it
was opened and the winds rushed therefrom
like a cyclone.
The first day Mr. Goebel fainted while expressing
himself in a loud and determined voice to a mass
meeting, and his speech had to be finished by Senator
Blackburn. On the same day Congressman Settle
fainted on the stump and fell from the height of his
climax, dislocating his oratory and sustaining severe
fractures of the objurgatory parts of speech, and his
effort had to be finished by a common pennyroyal
stumper from a rural district.
This is something new, and is a substantial addi
tion to the dramatic features of the fight.
There is one Kentuckian who does not faint nor
lose his wind and bottom. Simon Bolivar Buckner
keeps his head and his health and his pride in Betty
and the twins.
Referring to Altgeld's horror of the methods by
which Goebel was nominated. General Buckner says
they were merely copied from the methods used in
1896 at Chicago to nominate Bryan. The ousting of
the Michigan and Nebraska delegations to secure
Bryan's needed two-thirds was a piece of criminal
politics, in which the party policy was reversed, its
own administration repudiated and the stamp ot
regularity stuck on Bryan's candidacy and the reor
ganization of the party effected. Buckner is justly
astonished that the party in Kentucky should be criti
cized for a local application of that high example.
He commends Bryan for supporting Goebel, whose
nomination came by the methods which made Bryan
himself "the greatest of Americans" and tied him
to the affections of Dick Croker.
The anti-Goebel organization has selected Bryan's
picture as the official vignette of the opposition's
ticket, and when the orator of the Platte goes there
to spellbind the people he will be face to face with
himself on the bolting ticket.
The Goebel people claim that it is unfair to make
such use of the standing candidate's picture, because
in the districts where ignorance is bliss thousands of
Goebelitcs will vote the ticket from which that zinc
smile beams upon them.
It is with a proper sense of our distance and unfit
ness that we suggest to the regulars that they try as
a counter vignette the picture of a barrel of Kentucky
Bourbon.
Mr. Blackburn's most statesmanlike oratory always
contains an ascription to the "women, bosses and
whisky of old Kentucky, matchless, gentlemen, as the
bravery' of her sons." It is our opinion that the many
smiles in a barrel of Bourbon will outrun the single
smile on Colonel Bryan's face. The campaign will
go into history as "the battle of the smiles, Bourbon
against Bryan."
We are sure that this suggestion will please Colonel
Wattcrson, who has just expressed himself in the
Xcw York Journal as of the opinion that Colonel
Bryan is not the whole thing, anyway. A party that
<jpens its campaign by fainting all along the line
needs something to keep up its spirits, and what can
be more inspiring than a barrel of Bourbon, genuine
two-stamp goods? We anticipate the hope that will
sustain the opposition. Aware of the back counties,
where taxed whisky is unknown and the moonshine
article only is used at weddings, christenings and
murder?, the barrel of Bourbon will have no more in
fluence, than a Siwash totem.-
DUTCH AND BRITISH IN SOUTH
AFRICA.
BY way of warning to those British jingoes who
with gayety of heart are ready to enter upon a
war with the Boers, a writer in the Fort
nightly Review presents certain facts showing the
comparative strength of British and Dutch in South
Africa and revealing what kind of a contest Great
Britain would have on her hands in that quarter ot
the globe if war should break out.
The writer points out that the Boers are closely
united to the Dutch of Orange Free State and of Cape
Colony, not only by race and sympathy but by inter
ests and aspirations. A fight to a finish between the
Boers and the British therefore would certainly arouse
against the empire the antagonism of feeling of all
the Dutch and might arouse their active enmity in
battle. In other words, a war entered into lightly
against the Transvaal may move all South Africa to
strike for independence just as all the American colo
nies did when in the last century a jingo British Min
istry undertook to deprive New England of her rights.
Such being the case, a showing of the comparative
military strength of the two races in South Africa is
interesting. The writer for the Fortnightly estimates
it in the different states as follows, the figures repre
senting the numbers of armed men on each side:
Brit^h. Dutch.
Cape Colony 17,000 ' 50.000
Orange Free State 1.000 is.ooo
Transvaal 3,000 22.000
N;itul 6,000 1,500
British Bechuanaland , 500 500
HhodcFia 2,000 300
Imperial troops In South Africa at
the present time, say 10,000
Totals 39;500 92.300
The number of British troops in South Africa
has of course been largely increased since that esti
mate was made, and can be increased to almost any
number that may be needed. Ocean transportation
for troops in our time is comparatively easy, and
Britain rules the waves. She can send army after
army, if need be. for, as the jingo, chorus goes, "She
has the ships, she has the men, and she has the money,
too." The point of the warning is not that the Dutch
enn drive the British flag from South Africa as it was
driven from the United States a century ago, but that
they can involve the empire in a serious war and make
her empire so insecure that it will fall the first time
Great Britain has a powerful enemy in Europe to
confront.
"It is not easy to set bounds to the degree of folly a
nation may commit when flushed with the overween
ing confidence that is born of pride, power and pros
perity. It has been a long time since the British peo
ple have been engaged in war of any difficulty, and
they may be foolish enough to enter upon the sub
jugation of the Boers without counting the cost, but
it is hardly likely. Such warnings as the one given
are sure to have effect upon the minds of intelligent
men. Mr. Chamberlain is a jingo, indeed, but there
is nothing in his career to justify a belief that he is a
fool.
EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfiUGHT.
By his career in this country the dis
tinguished Charles Doyle, alias Augus
tus Howard, alias "Plunger" Hill, has
demonstrated that the difference be
tween the ignorant granger and the
know-it-all business man is to be mtas
ured by the difference between the
values of the gold bricks they buy.
When an unsophisticated, innocent,
confiding farmer trusts the pleasing
tale of a rank stranger and buys a bag
of brass filings at about the price of so
much gold, the world laughs and attri
butes the success of the fraud to the
ignorance of the farmer; but when a
shrewd man of affairs, who has started
with nothing and made millions of
money, falls a victim to a confidence
operator we gasp and stare as at some
kind of a miracle and wonder how such
things can be in a civilized country.
Yet there is no cause for wonder
ment. The farmer is not deceived be
cause of his ignorance. It is his greed
that makes him credulous, and it is
the same with the duped man of the
world. Each sees what he thinks is a
chance of getting something for noth
ing. Any man can cheat another who
can lead that other to believe he is
the one who is doing the cheating. If
the true story of the career in this
country of the man of many aliases
could be written it would be found he
got the best of our smart American
promoters of enterprise by inducing
them to believe they are getting the
best of him.
All the same the iniquitous Austra
lian is too sharp a blade to be left at
large and it is to" be hoped some provi
dential concatenation of circumstances
will enable our detectives to get not
only a clew, but the rascal himself.
We need him in the penitentiary as
a proof that providence is on the side
of virtue.

It is permissible of course for us all

Thorn i? a widespread belief that the
Government is so tied up with red tape
i it needs a month to do a work that pri
vate enterprise could do in a week,
j therefore, when the Government shows
speed, the thing is worth noting. For
that reason attention should be directed
to the promptness with which aid was
sent from this country to the stricken
people of Porto Rico.
The dispatch of Governor General
Davis announcing the effects of the
great hurricane was received by the
War Department at Washington on
August 11. On that same day orders
were sent to New York to purchase*
food supplies and the transport Mc
-I'horson was ordered to receive them.
The New York Tribune says: "Within
one hour contracts for 600.000 pounds of
rice and 600.000 quarts of beans were
placed, and inside of another hour
trucks were being loaded with the pro
duce for conveyance to the United
States transport McPherson, which is
to take it to Porto Rico."
The next clay the transport set out
on her voyage under full steam. Did
private enterprise ever beat that?
According to an old story, when
Satan undertook to tempt the philoso

wisdom and Incline his heart to folly,
he offered him first a dukedom, then
a principality, then a kingdom, then an
empire and finally the whole globe, but
still the philosopher refused.
"What," snld Satan, "will you not ac
cept the globe as a sufficient exchange
for one folly?"
"Most willingly would I commit forty
follies for it," said Acopslmos, "were it
not for the people on it."
On the subject of the annexation of

Here is a truly true advertisement
from a New York newspaper and it
means business. "A young Christian
man, with wife and four children, cul
tured people, needs $10,000 cash Imme
diately to invest in business and in a
home in the South; desires some kind
lady, or person, young or old, that is
alone in the world, to furnish him this
amount of funds and make her home at
once with his family Tor life and have
their care, sympathy and love."
The one satisfactory feature of the
proposal of that family of Christian
and cultured people is that when they
get the $10,000 they propose to go South
and not come to California. We can
stand a good deal in the way of enter
prise, but not too much â and we have
just entertained Mr. Howard.
Last Sunday I directed attention to a
report of a committee of the Selectmen
of Tyngsboro, Mass., to the effect that
a fire caused by lightning was due "to
the carelessness of the Lord." The re
port created something of a sensation
in Boston, and the Globe of that city
sent a man down to the village to in
vestigate it. The reporter, who writes
in the third person, speaking of him
self as "The Stranger." tells an inter
esting tale. The first Selectman he in
terviewed was a certain Enlow Perham
and the conversation ran thus: t
"Who wrote the report charging the
Deity with being guilty of carelessness
In allowing lightning to set fire to Olive
Plaisted's barn?"
"Mr. Sherburne, the chairman of the
board."
"Rather an odd way of stating the
cause of a fire, isn't it?"
"Sounds kind of funny, but still I
don't know but it is true enough."
"Is the chairman of the board a wag?
Is ho given to cracking jokes?"
"He Is a man who doesn't say much,
but he has got a good business head on
him. I know not how he came to write
what he did. Perhaps he started with
an L to put down lightning on the
paper and wrote Lord instead."
That explanation being flippant, was
! doubtless intended as a joke on the
stranger. When SJierburne was seen
he stood by his report like a stalwart.
When asked why he wrote it, he said:
"I had to give some cause for the fire
because the law requires it. True state
ment, isn't it?"
"Your orthodox fellow citizens would
hardly accept a declaration that the
Lord was careless."
"They ought to. They say he is re
sponsible for everything that happens
in this world of ours."
All of which goes to show th^re re
main in New England a good many
people who have a faith that is child
like, who believe, what they hear, and
do not shrink from the logic of their
faith. If the Lord be responsible for
what happens in Massachusetts, then
he was careless in letting his lightning
set fire to Olive Plaisted's barn. What
other verdict is possible?
Not the least interesting part of the
story of the trip to Tyngsboro is the
closing paragraph:
"The stranger went down to the depot
to wait for an electric car. 'Twaa now
after noon, and from a cloudless sky
the sun was shooting its shining rays
upon the placid waters of the winding
Merrimac. The green branches of the
trees on the farther shore were sway
ing in a gentle breeze. The girls were
swinging in the hammocks in the shade
beside the country homes set back from
the street. At any rate the Lord was
not careless when he created the nat
ural beauties of Tyngsboro."
If that paragraph were designed
merely as an expression of admiration
for Merrimac ripples and Tyngsboro
girls, it will pass muster; but if it be
put forward as a defense of the Massa
chusetts Deity it is irrelevant and im
material. The careful creation of a
girl in a hammock is no palliation of
the carelessness that burns a barn.

Toward the $50,000 required to make
an adequate' welcome for the California
volunteers the Market Street Railway
Company donated $250, and the sum
was promptly returned by the execu
tive committee, with the statement that
it was cut of all proportion to contri
butions made by other citizens and cor
porations who will receive little or no
benefit from the presence of the crowds
that will attend the reception.
In returning the money and deliver
ing the rebuke the committee acted
with dignity, for there is no pleasure in
accepting the money of a niggard, but
the action was nevertheless illogical.
The committee did not make its appeal
for money to the purses of citizens, but
to their patriotism; and considering the
amount of patriotism or State pride
there is in the officials of the Market
Street Company, the donation of $250
was remarkably generous. There is no
other instance likely to be found where
so large a sum was raised by an appeal
to so small a thing.

A story illustrating the way in which
troublesome political problems are
sometimes solved by a happy accident
comes to us from New Zealand. For a
long time the Government has had diffi
culty in keeping withta the bonds of
peace and good order a turbulent tribe
of natives. Many forms of conciliation
â were tried, but each in turn failed, and
it looked as if it would be necessary
"to make a df-sert and call it peace."
Just at the critical period of the affair
it chanced that a bronze statue of Vic
toria was to be unveiled at the capital.
The chiefs of the aggressive tribe were
invited to attend the ceremonies and
with a surly compliance they came.
No sooner did they behold the lustrous
bronze of tier Majesty's face than they
started with delight exclaiming: "Why,
she is one of us."
Since that time New Zealand has had
no more trouble with the tribe than
Democracy had with Populism after
nominating Bryan. In the belief that
the head of the British Empire is one of
their own kind, the once stubborn na
tives are now as bland as brothers to
the white folks, and are preparing to
run for office.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Dr. Franklin, when representing this
country in France, once entertained the
court of Louis XVI with a new game.
He wrote out a clever bit of gossip,
read it to one of the courtiers and re
quested him to tell it to a second. The
story was then repeated from one to
another until it had been heard and re
told by all the lords and ladies who
were present. The last to whom it was
told was called upon to repeat it aloud,
and when the telling was ended Dr.
Franklin read from his paper the origi
nal story. The fun of the game lay
in the surprise felt when it was seen
that the tale as last repeated bore not
the slightest resemblance to what had
been written.
A still more amusing illustration of
the way in which a story changes as
it passes from one person to another
is furnished in the development of the
news item sent out from this city con
cerning Mr. Huntington's famous after
dinner declaration against the excess
of education. As that story has been
transmitted in printed words, instead
of spoken ones, it ought to have pre
served its form as well as its essence in
traveling from here to New York, but
it lost both. It has recently been re
told with elaborate comment in an edi
torial by the New York Times, and as
given there is so different from what it
was in its original San Franciscan verl
tude, the average Californian would not
recognize it were it not for the appear
ance in it of Mr. Huntington's name.
According to this latest version of
the story Mr. Huntington made his
declaration in reply to a deputation
from a "boom town" in California
which had called to urge him to found
a university there in order that his
name as a public benefactor and a pat
ron of learning might be linked with
the history of the booming metropolis
and be remembered forever hereafter
with all the veneration now given to
that of Leland Stanford.
Upon that story the Times bases a
very good editorial, but it will not be
worth while to quote it. The story is
sufficient in itself. There may be Cali
fornians who without a smile can
imagine a deputation of other Califor
nians asking Huntington to found a
university and urging it by citing the
example of Stanford, but if such therÂ«
be they are of recent Eastern importa
tion and wouldn't know a joke from a
saw buck.

THE RAN TRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 20, 1899.
POLICE GET NEWS OF
DOYLE ,ALIAS HOWARD
The Plunger Was Seen on the Oregon
Express Nearing Portland.
"Handsome" George Adams and "Teddy" Alex
ander Make Further Statements Showing
Chiefly That Thugs Were Hired to
Do Away With Green,
Charles Doyle, alias Augustus Howard,
wanted on a charge of swindling "Wlllard
Reed Green of Denver out of large sums
of money, is thousands of miles away
from San Francisco. All . the time the
police believed' him to be in hiding in this
city he was speeding northward, and Is
now supposed to be in some town in Bru
sh Columbia, awaiting his opportunity to
;lip away to the Orient.
Positive information as to the move
ments of Doyle was received in this city
yesterday from a Mr. Little, connected
with Wells, Fargo & Co., who la now in
Portland. It was mailed from that place,
which he reached on Sunday from San
Francisco, and was addressed to a well
known business man of this city, who
immediately turned It over to Chief' Lees.
In the letter Little says he saw Doyle,
whom he knew as Howard, pass through
the sleeper of the Oregon express on Sat
urday night last. He saw. him again the
next day on the train as it neared Port
land, but paid no particular attention to
the matter until he picked up a newspaper
>n Monday at that city and saw the police
were looking for Howard. He sat down at
once and wrote the letter.
Chief Lees is satisfied that Little is not
mistaken, and that the man of many
aliases has made good his escape. From
his position in the Wells-Fargo Bank Lit
tle had numerous opportunities of seeing-
Howard, and in his letter cites that fact
to show that he could not be mistaken
In the fugitive.
Up till the receipt of the letter Chief
Lees and the detectives working on the
caso had evtry reason to believe that
their man was in "hiding in this city, al
though it is prosumed they took the usual
course in such cases and sent broadcast
telegrams calling (or the apprehension of
the fugitive, following them later with
full descriptions, supplemented with pho
tographs. The movements of Doyle's wife
and the mt.rmer Of his attorneys, who
loudly [aimed the innocence of their
client and rather intimated that he would
soon put in an appearance to refute the
charges made against him and confound
his accusers and the police, gave- addi
tional ground Cor this belief.- On top of
all this the detectives had assurances
from several persons who claimed to be
acting in the interest of Howard that he
was in town, sick, but would give him
self up if some plan could be devised
whereby the bail would be reduced to
such a figure that the accused could meet
it by depositing cash.
Frank McGregor, .an attorney and a
well-known character around town known
as "Fingers," by reason -of the fact that
several of those useful members are miss
ing from his hands, figuredas the go-be
tween in t,he last instance. La.st Thurs
day McGregor approached Bailiff Thomas
P. Barry of Police Judge Slogan's court,
in which the-Â»warrants lor Doyle's arrest
were sworn out, and asked him what was
the chance of getting Doyle's bail re
duced. Barry asked him why he wanted
to know, and" McGregor replied that there
was a thousand dollars in it for him if
the ball could be reduced to such a fig
ure that Doyle, or, as he ailed him, How
ard pould raise it. Barry told McGregor
that he would have to see the police
about that. ' â¢
McGregor saw Detective Thomas Gib
pon a short time afterward and asked
him the same question. Gibson said he
thought the bail could be reduced some.
He then asked McGregor it he was act-
Ing for Doyle and the attorney replied
that he was, saying his man would give
himself up at once if the bail was reduced
to $20,000. Gibson held out for $25,000 ana
finally went to Chief Lees with the mat-
C<> i've got nothing to do with the bail,"
paid the Chief. "All I want is the man. I
have no objection to a reduction; get the
Gibson then saw Judge Mogan, who
agre-ed that he would cut the bail to $20,
--(XiO but refused the request- Of McGregor
that he would sign an agreement to that
effect McGregor, who â¢ had been rein
forced by '.'Fingers," left the City Hall,
promising that if everything was .satis
factory to the friends of Howard he would
return and prepare to deliver his prin
cipal into custody. He did not come back
during the day, but that evening sent for
Detective Gibson, with whom he had an
other talk, "Fingers" also being present.
The trio parted wgain. it being the under
standing that Howard would be surren
dered the next day. '
The next day came, and McGregor and
"Fingers" met Gibson according to ap
pointment, without result. They met him
again Thursday night and explained the
non-appearance of their man on the
ground that he had been unable to raise
the necessary ball but would do bo very
soon, their manner being taken to indicate
that "very soon" meant yesterday. Yes
tarday brought with it the letter from
little containing positive information of
the "plunger's" whereabouts, and the
search for the fugitive in this city was
abandoned. 'â¢'.â - i''-. : '-'i. j
Although it is now proved beyond a
doubt that the police were mistaken In
thinking for a moment that the man
they wanted would remain to be captured
and stand trial, their time does not ap
pear to have been wasted. During the
two days McGregor and "Fingers" held
out the" ignis fatuus of the proximity of
Doyle, they have got from several wit
nesses direct evidence of the connection
of Doyle. alias Howard, with the Austra
lia!! crooks Murphy. Kelly and Casey,
who robbed the strong room of the steam
er Alameda, ier having given Howard
the "double cross" on his plan to murder
Millionaire Green. "Hands George
Adams Is one of these and "Teddy" Alex
ander, trainer and handler of pugilists. is
S'nce the occasion of his first visit to
the police Adams has taken pains to deny
to several reporters that he knew any
thing concerning Doyle, or Howard, be
yond the fact that he was a good fellow,
with money to burn. This denial was
made under Instructions from the police
and from Adams' lief that it might not
be well for him to make public all he
knew of the man of many aliases, while
there was any likelihood that. that Indi
vidual would turn up. Now that he knows
Howard is thousands of miles away,
Adams breathes easier and talks more.
He admits that he was one of a party of
three, of which Teddy Alexander was
PASTOR W. B. ANDERSON
ORDERED TO SACRAMENTO
â¢ TOvEV. W. B. ANDERSON, the
T \i^J) well-known pastor of Bethel A. .
v IP^L M- SS. Church, has been ordered
.j. Â° by Bishop Galnes to go imme
-5* diateiy to Sacramento an.l take charge
â¢'.â¢ of Jhe Bethel A. M. K. Church of that
X city. Pr. Anderson's congregation Is
J. greatly depressed at the news and are
J only consoled by the thought that
V their pastor is going to a wider field to
A do good. During the three years he has
X been in charge of the local church he
Q has won innumerable friends by his"
A courtesy and strict attention to duty.
V "When he first accepted the pastorate
A the Bethel A. M. E. Church had a $9000
;, debt hanging over it. but by energetic
I work he reduced it over $3000, increased hla congregation and placed the
? church on a sountl hasis.
> To-night he will take formal leave of his flock and there is no doubt that
S tears will be sheci by many in losing him. He will review his three years'
s work in their midst and give them some parting spiritual advice. Rev. W.
I \Y. Grimes of Sacramento will take charge of the local congregation.
| one, that was in Jimmie Murphy's state
; room on the steamer Alameda the night
â  of March 22 last, before she sailed, and
i he says he heard Murphy say to Alexan-
I der:
"What do you think! This man Howard
! wants us to throw Green overboard. I've
gut my part of the swag, and I'm going
j to dig out."
Murphy's part of the swag was $5000,
which was paid to him on the dock by
Howard, Murphy at that time being in
Howard's own carriage, which had been
driven from Kelly's stable by Howard's
| own coachman, Rudolph Shade.
Frank Kelly has admitted to the police
that he not only handled the sack How
ard took from the Bank of Commerce
j safety deposit box. but counted it as well,
i the first time ln Jesse Marks' saloon and
| the second time in the toilet at the Palace
i Hotel.
Adams has also admitted to the police,
; as heretofore stated in The Call, that he
' acted for Howard in spreading abroad the
: rumors that Green was the man who had
; hired men to commit murder on the high
i sea.
From Alexander the police not only ob
! talned a corroboration of the story told by
i Adams of the conversation, with Murphy
! in the stateroom of the steamer Alameda,
but they got evidence to show that Mur
i phy, Kelly and Casey had committed a
j diamond robbery in Australia in addition
; to robbing a bank at Auckland, New Zea
! land. In fact, Alexander admitted that he
! had had -in his possession a number of
i pawn tickets for the diamonds which Kel
ly. -Murphy and Casey had stolen, ar.d
had sold. two of them to women in this
city. Another ticket he gave to Danny
Needham. the well-known pugilist.
Alexander said the tickets had been
given to him by Murphy. He also told the
police some of the things the trio of Aus
tralian crooks had confided in him con
cerning the Auckland bank robbery. They
- r ht up with them as the result, of
that exploit bank bonds of the value of
Â£960, which they sold to brokers ln this
city.
In the face of this tesFimony of How
ard's pals, Adams and "Teddy" Alex
! ander, who chummed so closely with
i Casey, Murphy and Kelly, the attorneys
J for Howard may still insist that appear
| ances are not against their man. Once

The phenomenal cures made by Pro.essor
P. A. Weitmer of Nevada, Mo., have been so !
ling and wonderful as to attract the at- j
tention of scientists and physicians throughout
the world. An eminent physician who has won j
of the medical profession by his
history of Esculapius. the heal'.ng god, known
In B. i". SJS, says: Whjle it Is true that we are j
told that Esculapius became so efficient in the :
healing art that he actually succeeded so far
ai to restore the dead to life, and in this way
Offended Pluto, who complained to Jove of the
Innovation, and Jove slew Esculapius by a flash !
Of lightning, still In making my researches ud ,
. tit day I can say without hesitation
that Professor S. A. Weitmer. the great Ne-
vada, M > . Magnetic Healer, has done more for
science and humanity than did Esculapius. for
this wonderful man has followed the precept of
the Living Christ.- In this I do not mean to be I
sacrilegious but to emphasize my statement j
by saying that the Great Nevada (MoJ Pclen-
tist Is following in the path made by Him who
was born at Bethlehem, and healing without
drugs or the surgeon's knife. Again, Professor
S A. Weitmer is more generous to humanity
than was Esculapius. for the latter had a few
era kn wn as the Ascleplades. who were
li | by an oath not to divulge the secret of
the healing art. while any â¢ ne placing them-
selves in communication with Professor S. A.
Weitmer can receive instruction from him. for
he is most anxious to teach his art to others,
that the great method, of which he Is the
founder may live and continue to bring the

Is Asked to Answer
Sharp Queries.
CHINATOWN VICE UNCHECKED"
HIS ATTENTION CALLED TO A
PROMISE HE MADE.
Neglect on the Part of His Honor to
Aid the Society in Its Good
Work Irritates Its
Members.
Secretary M. M. Foote of the Vigilant
I Society, which was organized for the pur
j pose of morally cleansing Chinatown by
closing dens of vice, has addressed an
other communication to his Honor in ,
which he calls the Mayor's attention to
his laxity in coming to the aid of the so
ciety, as he had promised. The docu
ment', which in all probability will be the |
last to be sent to the Mayor by the V'igi
lants secretary, is full of pointed queries
which his Honor is invited to answer. it
is as follows;
Hon. James D. Phelan. Mayor of the City ]
and County of San Francisco, State of Califor- :
niaâDear Sir: Pardon us for again attracting
your attention to the duty of certain public I
officials to suppress Chinese houses of ill fame,
and to the additional fact that they still exist
in the city and county. â 
We acknowledge that the Chief of Police paid
no attention to the letter of the secretary of
this society pointing out section 4 of the act
of March 31, 1566. which made it his duty, as
well as yours, to suppress Chinese houses or ill -
fame without requiring any notice from an> j
person whatsoever. ..
We acknowledge that the Board of fcupervi
sors (who received from the secretary of this
society a similar notice to those sent the Chief
of Police and yourself) dodged the Issue and de
i clined to do its duty upon the ground that
! the act was in their opinion unconstitutional,
: and then ordered the offensive notice to be sent
! to the Chief of Police, who already had a no
tice almost identical â¢ with the one they sent
i him. Why they sent this notice to the Chief
! If they considered the act unconstitutional is
more than we are able to comprehend, unless
â¢ they regarded it as a "trespasser and desired
him to arrest it without warrant and throw It
into the tanks without booking it. Surely they
did not mistake It for the "official notice"
which It Is said that the Chier of Police re
quires ere he Is willing to act.
I The Board of .Supervisors' opinion of the un
i constitutionality of the said act is almost M
! peculiar as their sending the notice to the
\ Chief of Police. They first declare the act of
March 31, 1566, to be unconstitutional, and
i thereafter upon July 24, MS, they base a reso
i lution declaring the Hotel Nymphia to be a |

they would be doubted by the skeptical ones â 
If the proofs were not bo positive. A few In- \
stances of which we mention:
Hon. Press Irons, Mayor of Nevada, was
afflicted with kidney and bladder troubles for
ten, years and could find no relief in the usual
remedies. In one week he was completely re-
stored by Professor Weltmer.
Mr. John S. Small, Coif ax. 111., was deaf in
his left ear for seven years; could not hear a i
watch tick' when placed against his ear. Was
permanently cured in three days by Professor
â Weltmer. Mr. L.. W. Rains, a wealthy lum-
berman of Hornbeak. Term., suffered constantly
with kidney trouble for twenty years; also with I
constipation and prostatlc troubles. Exhausted .
the best medical skill, but no relief. He for-
tunately heard of Professor Weitmer. and was |
soon restored to perfect health, and now says 1
this treatment will cure anybody. Mrs. M. E. I
Hawkins, Loulsburg, Kans., was afflicted
twenty years with prolapsus and enlargement i
of the womb. Indigestion and perpetual head- :
ache. Tried everything that offered relief and I
gave up In despair. Heard of Professor Welt- ;
mer, took his treatment one week and was
permanently restored to health.
Professor Weltmer also possesses the remark-
able ability to curÂ» people at a distance, and
hundreds have been restored in this way. Mr.
G. W. Hlghtower. Tiff City. Mo., was a total
wreck, having suffered many years with
stomach liver and kidney troubles. Tried
everything without relief. Fully restored by
Professor Weltmer 1 s Absent Method.
Mrs. Minnie Porter. Texarkana, Tex., was
afflicted for eighteen months with kidney and j
other diseases, and for twelve months unable j
to get out of her bed. Was expected to die at j
any time. Permanently cured by Professor I
nuisance and ordering it to be closed and sup
pressed, upon an amendment to the said act of
ISG6. which they had declared to be unconsti
tutional. In the first instance they have al
leged that they acted upon their own
opinion, and it may be possible that in the last
they acted upon the opinion of some one else
who knew more about the subject matter. At
any rate we are inclined to believe that it is
safer to rely upon the opinion of the large num
ber of cood lawyers from all parts of the State
who were members of the two Legislatures
which passed the said act and its amendment,
upon the opinion of the two Governors . who
gave it their indorsement, and upon that of the
Code Commissioners who continued it In effect.
Upon the other hand, if the Board of Super
visors have the power to declare the Hotel
Nymphia to be a "house of ill-fame" and a
"public nuisance" and order it "to be forth
with closed and suppressed" why have not they
the same power "to forthwith close and sup
press" the Chinese houses of ill-fame which are
known by every one of them to exist in this
city and county?
But they fail to close these cesspools of sin.
Why? Can it be that. they consider these iron
barred prisons where female slaves are nightly
subjected to assault and constantly to false
imprisonment as necessary institutions, which
it is their official duty to protect by failing to
suppress them? â 
]>Â you suppose that these public officials
who aid these- heathen lawbreakers by neglect-
Ing to suppress their houses ever stop to con-
Rider what portion of their vice they, as pub
lic servants, are responsible for; or what pro
portion of the expense their neglect causes
this city, State and county?
Who is responsible tor the fact that private
citizens arc forced to organize societies for the
prevention of cruelty to children?
Who is responsible for the â  fact that the
churches are forced at great expense to estab
lish and sustain missions for rescuing these
unfortunate slave girls, many of whom are
minors of tender years?
Who Is responsible for the fact that .the
courts are forced to give their valuable atten
tion to the vile and disgust evidence and
perjury brought to light in the hearing of the
numerous writs of habeas corpus sworn out
by these foreign yellow fiends Incarnate?
Who is responsible that little Kirn Oy was
within the past five or six weeks sold into
slavery for J1TOO: rescued by the M. E. church
missionaries and the Eureka Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children?
How long are these abuses to be tolerated?

suppressing these Chinese houses of 111-fame?
We are forced to ask the above questions
i owing: to the fact that it is now three months
I since you were notified of your duty to sup
: press Chinese houses of ill fame, and your at
tention called to the law requiring the Mayor,
j the Board of Supervisors and the Chief of Po
lice to suppress Chinese houses of ill fame.
Four days later in a letter to the secretary of
this society you agreed to send the notices re
quired by law and asked for such information
as we possessed as to the location of the said
houses anil the names of their owners and in
mates. Six days later you received from us
i the information you requested. It was nearly
one month later when you caused these no
tices to be served, to wit., upon June 15. Sinco
that time over sixty days have elapsed and we
have heard nothing from you regarding this
matter.
What are we to believe? Are we to think
that you intend to do nothing further? If so,
kindly let us know and we will take pleasure
in endeavoring to do without the assistance of
the public officials, what the law clearly makes
it their duty to do.
We regret sincerely your failure to close
these houses, which suggests the thought that
you never intended to close them. Now It is
just a question for you to decide whether you
will do anything or not: If you fail to do so we
will wonder why you ever wrote us your letter
I of May 12, 1899. Very respectfully,
M. M. FOOTE. Secretary.

Not a Temporary Dangerous Stimulant, Such as

but a Permanent Restoration to Health and Strength.
A great many people do not seem to understand the difference be-
tween the regular practitioner and the medical expert who has devoted
his life study to. say. three or four complicated diseases. They seem to
be under the impression that every physician cures any disease with
equal success. It is an every-day experience to have a patient say, "I
have tried nearly every remedy sold by druggists for my trouble," and
the invariable verdict is "No benefit." Another will say: "I have been
treated by Beveral family physicians in my neighborhood who thought
they could cure me, but the results proved otherwise."

Jong experience In curing DISEASES AND WEAKNESS OF MEN*.

VIOLET SUTTON WINS.
SANTA MONICA, Aug. IP.â The tennis
tournament that closed to-day has been
one of the best ever held In Southern Cal
ifornia. The uncertainty of the cham
pionship has added a zest to the play, and
a curious feature haa been that four sis
ters, the Misses Button, played in leading
events, competing with each other, defeat
ing all opponents ami finally playing for
the championship among themselves.
The northern man, Sumner Hardy, has
made many friends by his courteous ri
valry, and will be welcomed whenever he
(â¢â¢'tnes again to try the fortune of tennis
war. The most exciting contest of the
day was the game between Hardy and
Way and the youngsters, liendricka and
Sinsabaugh. Three times were the lads
on the point of winning when the older
players escaped defeat by a terrific play.
In the finals Miss Violet Sutton defeated
her sister Ethel, winning the cup and the
j championship. The games overflowed the
i two tennis courts, and the consolation
i singles were played in the Miramar
courts.
The tennis ball this evening was held at
; the Casino and was a great social event,
Mr. and Mrs. Roy Jones having it in
hand.

SUCCESS OF THE MEETING.
i .
One of the most sensational race meets
ever held in California reached its con
clusion yesterday at Santa Rosa. Such
veterans of tho turf a.s Monroe Salisbury
and l^ot Slocum aflirm they have never
Been such high-class racing, one day af
ter another, as has taken place here' dur
| ing the week.
On 1-Tkiay a four-yoar-old mare stepped
I miles In a race In 2:13% and 2:l2'i. Timed
1 separately in the second heat, in which
she was off badly, she was found to have
traveled in 2:10. In the 2:16 class trot
the horses wont three heats In 2:l."?Vi. 2:11';
and 2:12 1 / 4, while two-year-old pacers did

Mr. Helman's great horse, Alta Rio, a
full brother to Cbehalis, 2:04Â« i. and Del
Norte, 2:09, which broke two small bones
in bis near hind ankle, is improving rap-
I idly. Alta Rio is one of the greatest
I horses in California and the accident was
I lamentable. Mr. Helman expected Alta
to get a record of 2:10 or better this sea
! son. He was well entered throughout the
circuit.
on Friday a singular accident happened
to the bay mare Mabel MeKinney. While
she was being jogged previous to her race
: she suddenly staggered and went along
on three legs. Investigation showed that
one of the tendons of the foreleg was
badly sprained.
The Santa Rosa track has proved to be
fast, and the directors of the Pacific Coast
j Trotting Horse Breeders' Association as
sert that they are satisfied with the
patronage accorded the meeting.
It was hard luck when George Berry
had A. B. Spreckels' mare Psyche shut
out among a class of horses that she
should have been able to beat. It was
hard luck when Mr. Lumsden's mare Rob
let was shut out the first heat among a
class of horses that had no right to beat
her, for she can go a mile in 2:10 or bet
ter. It was hard luck for Mr. Salisbury
when Theron, from whom he expected
freat things, proved hlmseif a ''quitter.'
n spite of these misfortunes the meeting
has been a marked success.
ACCIDENT MARS
THE CLOSING DAY
AT SANTA ROSA
Driver Tryon Badly
Injured.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Aug. 19.â biggest
crowd of the week attended the last day's
races of the meeting at Pierce Brothers'
track this afternoon. Six hundred per
sons came down from Ukiah on an excur
sion train, and other towns to the north
were well represented. The Inside field
was crowded by private carriages half
way around and two rows deep, and the
grandstand and betting field were thickly
populated with enthusiasts. The day was
pleasant and the track in good condition.
The first race was the 2:30 class trot,
best three in five, for a purse of $1000. A
great deal of Interest centered in this
event from the fact that McGregor &
Hockin's bay mare Eleanor Ann, the local
equine which made such a splendid show
ing on the first day, was scheduled to ap
pear again. There were entered Juan
Chico, Eleanor Ann, Dos Minutos, Ruby
X, Lottie Parks and Psyche. The latter
sold favorite all the way through.
In the first heat Ruby N had the pole
and she was first at the quarter, passing
the pole In :S3. From there on. Lottie
Parks had the lead, reaching the half in
I:O9Vi. The drive down the stretch was
redhot between Ruby N and Lottie Parks,
but the Crowley mare reached the wire
first by a half neck, scoring in 2:19^. The
horses wore sent off In the second heat
in very poor shape, the local mare several
lengths behind, much to the disgust of her
many admirers. The entire course was a
scries of successive surprises, but Psyche
came under the ' wire several lengths
ahead of everything else, and Eleanor
Ann was second. In this heat .Lottie
Parks was distanced, and as Dos Minutos
had been shut out in the first, only four
horses started in the third heat. The
start was good and Psyche soon took the
lead. At the quarter she broke badly and
fell back to third place, the Santa Rosa
mare taking the lead. Coming down the
stretch Psyche forges! ahead and won the
heat from the local favorite by a length
in 2:19. In the fourth heat Psyche got off
in the lead, with Eleanor Ann a close sec
ond, but before reaching the quarter pole
the Spreckels mare broke and fell to the
rear. At the half Eleanor Ann had the
lead by four lengths, but about that time
Psyche began to close up. Spreckels' en
try and the local mare came down the
stretch neck and neck. Psyche broke
within ten feet of the wire and the heat
went to Eleanor Ann in 2:20%. Psyche
having been set back for repeated break
ing, in the fifth heat the horses got on*
well bunched. Psyche leading slightly. At
the quarter she was bringing up the rear
of the procession and Eleanor Ann was
away ahead. At the half the mare that
carried the money and the one that haa
the friends were neck and^xieck. From
there on Psyche led; winning by several
lengths In J:I7U, With Eleanor Ann sec
ond. Psyche took lirst money, Eleanor,
Ann second, Ruby N third, and Juan
Chico saved his entrance tee.
The second race was the 2:15 pace, best
two in three, for a purse of $1(XK). Eleven
horses were entered and ten answered the
call. They were: Arthur W, Ketciium,
Dictatres, Harvey Mac, Goldie, Primrose,
Don Fannie Putnam, Deceiver ami
Belle W.
During the preliminary scoring the
pneumatic tire on Primrose's sulky came
off. causing some delay. While scoring
again Primrose fell just opposite the
grand stand, giving Driver Tryon a nasty
tall. Horse and sulky rolled completely
over him, but Tryon was game and
jumped up ami caught the mare as she
scrambled to her feet. Physicians were
called for and the unfortunate man was
tarried to the stable. Another driver waa
put up and the scoring continued. An
examination showed that Tryon's collar
bone was broken, one end protruding
through the llesh. The shoulder was dis
located and the breastbone. fractured.
Three times the horses were returned
to the stable on account of inability to
Mart properly, nearly two hours being
consumed altogether in scoring- in this
race before the first heat. When the
horses were finally sent away P. ii.
Qulnn'fl big black horse Arthur w, with
J. Quinn up, was slightly in the lead. At
the Quarter it looked like a procession.
At the half they were fairly well bunched,
but at no time during the heat did the
black relinquish bis position. Coming
down the stretch, Fannie Putnam gave
him a brush, but the Quinn horse took
the heat by a length In 2:11%. e'annie
Putnam won the second in 2 : 1 4 l i and iol
lowed it up by winning the third in 2:14.
The third and last race was the ihree
year-old trot, 2:30 class, best two in three,
for a purse of $300. The bookmakers
picked the brown filly Miss Barnabee for
favoritism, offering 6 to 10 on her against
the field. The start was a fair one, but
just after leaving the wire the favorite
took the lead and hold it all the way
around. She came under the wire in a
Jog, several lengths ahead of Lena A, in
2:23%. Tia Juana and Blanche T were
both distanced, and Charles G did not
come to the scratch at all. so the next
heat was between Lena A and Miss Bar
nabee. The latter took the heat and race
in 2:21%:
During tho afternoon the Spreckels
team, Marguerite and Annie Rooney,
went an exhibition mile hitched â to
a bike wagon. Silkwood, the Santa Ana
stallion, advertised * extensively as "the
guideless wonder," also went an exhibi
tion round. The announcement that he
would appear and pace without harness
or driver had aroused much interest. He
was in charge of Bunch, the well known
driver, who started him off alone at the
end of the stretch. He went around in
beautiful shape and later repeated the
performance.
Except for the work of Samuel Gamble,
who officiated as starter, the entire meet
ing has been a great success. The com
plaint against Gamble has been heard in
the grand stand and on the track and field
every day since the meeting commenced.

CAPTURE THE DEL
MONTE DOUBLES
Clever Tennis in the
Finals.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DEL, MONTE, Aug. 19.â Rarely has any
resort been the scene of two such notable
sporting events simultaneously as those
that occurred at Del Monte to-day, and
the Interest that was manifested in each
shows how much of the true sportsman
like spirit there is among the visitors in
this big caravansary. To-day's tennis
matches were as well attended by mem
bers of the smart set and the good points
as vigorously cheered as on yesterday,
and th^ players were thereby encouraged
to do some of the best work of their lives.
Indeed, the tennis of to-day, all of which
except two matches were scratch con
tests, was as good as any seen on Cali
fornia courts and much better than most
of the tournaments.
The prevailing sentiment at the begin
ning of the tournament was that handi
capping would play havoc with the men's
form and a really good team would be
unable to do brilliant work, but quite the
contrary proved to be the case, and the
scratch matches in the consolation tour
nament to-day developed tne fact that the
men who received the benefit of the hand
icaps won not so much on the advantage j
thus gained as on their own excellent j
work. While Hardy and Code came out |
victorious and won the handsome silver j
oiimbs and brushes that the hotel man
ap.ment provided as first prize, every |
match was closely contested "and their
very best efforts were necessary to keep
from going down before the stiff play of
their opponents. In the finals Smith and |
Phillips r;m them such a close match, de
spite a constantly recurring cramp in the
leg from which Smith suffered during the
entire contest, that several times th<? lat
ter team almost won out. It Is believed j
by some, that but for the trouble that i
Smith had with his leg he ahd Phillips I
would have taken the final set.
The consolation tournament proved so ]
successful that" the hotel management has
off( itd another set of prizes to be com*
pi ted for to-morrow by the teams tl'.-vt i
lost in to-day .â¢ contests. The drawing j
for the consolations was held last nights
and resulted as follows: Root and Brad
shaw vs. Warburton and Fatjo; Jones
and Aryuello vs. Emery and Willeyi
Johnston and Seager vs. Hunt and Stone;
Pyburn and Rowling vs. Harper broth
ers.
Play commenced at 9:30- this morning,
with Rout and Bradshaw of San Fran
cisco and Warburton and Fatjo of Santa
Clara In the opposite courts. The former
t<am won the toss and Fatjo served first.
The Santa Clara boys played in good
form, the serving of Fatjo and the side
line play of his partner being particular
ly fine. Dr. Root, who was in bad form i
yesterday, showed up in bettor style -to
day. He drove at times phenomenally
and accurately. George Bradshaw was,
as usual, on his mettle, and returned al- I
most anything. The team played strictly :
uniform and won the match.
Emery of Nevada and Willey of Pacific
Grove defaulted to Jor.es and Arguello of
Salinas. Pyburn brothers of Salinas de- |
faulted to Harper brothers of Pacific
Grove.
Johnston and Scaper of San Francisco ,
played against Hunt and Stone of Aia
meda. Hunt, who had been quite ill and
who showed up in such poor form in the
first day's events, to-day played an excel- !
lent, aggressive game. Stone was in bet- \
tÂ« r form, too. His drives Were often hard
and accurate, while his partner's lobs j
were deep, frequent ami effective. Dr. |
S< ..^' r, who played brilliant tennis yes
ttrday. played many clever strokes' to- j
day. Merle Johnston, his partner, was ,
lather Inaccurate, but made a good show*
ing. The Alamedans won after losing !
one set. 5-7, (i-1 and G-2.
In the semi-finals Jones and Arguello
were matched against Dr. Root and
George Bradshaw. The latter team took
four straight games. The Salinas men,
however, braced and made several deuce
games, but scored only one game during |
the set. In the second set the San Fran
ciscans again played an aggressive game '
an<l won easily in 6â2.
Dr. Phillips and Grant Smith played
Harper brothers of Pacific Grove a match ;
unfinished yesterday on account of dark
ness. Each team had scored one set, but 'â 
by mutual consent the entire match was
played over. The local cracks wero de- j
feated in two straight sets, 6 â 2, 6â2, but
before being vanquished played some good
tennis.
Code and Hardy vs. Phillips and Smith ;
started the finals in the handicap affair.
Dr. Seager acted as scorer. Code and
Hardy won the toss and took south side
of the court. Dr. Phillips served first ami
from first to last of the entire match
played an accurate although defensive
game. Grant Smith smashed continually
and many times effectively. Code was in
excellent form, and throughout the match .
made a strong partner for Hardy. Hardy
in the first set showed some poor plays j
but braced toward the latter part and won I
the set, Câ 4. In the second set, after!
furious play. Hardy and Code won, 6 â 4. I
Smith and Phillips braced wonderfully in !
the third set, played an aggressive game 'â 
I and turned the tables on the final winners
of the match with a like score, 6 â 4. The I
fourth and fifth sets were played care
fully. In the fourth set, at the fourth
gamp. Smith was attacked by cramps In
the log and was compelled to rest two !
minutes, after which he entered the court
and played in oM-time form. Hardy and j
his partner brought the game up to deuce,
but their opponents won out, Bâ6.
The fifth set, which was not only the '
most exciting of the match but by far the
most interesting tennis played in "the tour
ney, brought out some phenomenal >
strokes by Hardy, clever blocks by Code I
effective back-court work by their oppo
nents and superb volleying by all four
players. At no time until the match was
finished could the outcome be predicted '
Hardy and Code took the set by 9 to 7 !
thereby winning for themselves "the first
prize, two silver toilet sets. The defeated :
team received as prizes two diamond scarf '
pins.
In the finals in the consolation doubles i
Hunt and Stone played Root and Brad- ;
shaw. The former team won handily In :
three straight setsâ 6-2, 6-2 and 7-5. Both
team received rackets as prizes The !
summary of the games follows:
Phillips and Smith defeated Harper ;
brothers, 6-2, 6-2.

The pigeon shoot to-day was 'a decided !
success from a sporting point of view
some excellent records being made. Four
teen entriesâ right from the Country Club
and six from Burllngamc â were madt> and
the preliminaries resulted In a tie In the
shootoff of which R. B. Murdock emerged
victorious as winner of the Del Monte
cup, with F. R. Webster second, he tak
ing the Wordon cup. The shoot was open
to all California country clubs, hut repre
sentatives of only two entered, thus mak
ing the contest rather in the nature of
team shooting. About 600 birds were lib
erated from traps, 400 being brought down,
leaving a lo.w percentage of misses.
R. B. Murdock, A. H. Whitney, F. R. ,
Webster and C. W. Tuttlc each brought
down 24 birds out of a possible 25. tying
for first place, and in the shootoff each

SPLENDID RECORD OF A
CALIFORNIA SOLDIER BOY
AMONG those who enlisted in the
volunteer army and went to the
Philippines to fight the Spaniards
at the outbreak of hostilities be
tween Spain and the United States was
a young Californian, a San Francisco
boy, Harold Chambers. He joined the
Twentieth Kansas when that now
famous regiment was here en route to
the Philippines, and that he has ac
quitted himseif nobly is proved by the
following tribute to his bravery and
strict attention to duty, written by
t'aptain Kdmund Boltwood, under
â whom be has served since he donned
T'liele Sam's uniform and started upon
his care.-r as a soldier:
"MANILA, P. 1.. July 11, 1<599.
"Editor San Francisco ("'all : I wish
to make known through your paper
the record of a Californian, Harold
Chambers, who enlisted in my com
pany while we were at Camp Merritt
and whose parents reside at H-ll Sacramento street, in your city. He has been
my company clerk, in which position he has bee,, of much value to me. This
has not kept him. however, from being on the firing line, and he has been present
in the following battles:
"Tondo, February 4; Blnonolo, February .".; Caloocan. February 10; Tuliuhan
River. March 2S: Polo, March 2-5; Marioloa, March 27: Guiguinto. March 20; Mal
olos. March 31; Calumpit or Bagbag River, April 25; Apalit, April 27; San Toraas,
May 4.
"In addition to this, he was for twenty-seven consecutive days under fire 1n
the trenches in front of Caloocan, and always showed remarkable nerve and cool
courage. At the Rio Grande River he anxiously and earnestly pressed his claim
to the privilege of swimming across with the rope with which the raft was to be
pull, d over, but the men had been selected and he was denied.
"But it is of another kind nf heroism that 1 wish to speak. At the battle of
Apalit he was shot in the left side, the ball striking a rib. passing under the
flesh and coming out five inches from the point of entrance. Chambers, although
stunned for a moment, did not lose bis presence of mind. He says he thought
of his mother, who is very nervous and troubled with heart disease, and fearing
that the telegraphic report of bis being wounded might be fatal to her. he de
termined to say nothing of it and rejoined the tiring line. After th* firing had
: be secretly dressed his wound, kept on duty until May 4. when he was
again In his place at the battle nf San Tomas. where his foot was badly
sprained and BWOllen. He went with us. however, to San Fernando, from which
place he was sent to the hospital at Manila, where his wound was first discovered.
He is at present back again and doing his duty with the company. Respectfullj
yours, . EDMUND BOLTWOOD.
Captain, Company X, Twentieth Kansas, U. S. V."
NARROW ESCAPES
OF THE PALMYRA
FROM SHIPWRECK
Nearly Went Down in
a Hurricane.
Thf officers and men of tho American
hnrk Palmyra are rot likely to forget the
voyage from Australia, just ended, in a
hurry. During the first portion of the run
the vessel nearly went down in a hurri
cane, and during the latter portion she
came within a short distance of going
ashore near Point Reyes and again at
Point Bonlta.
During the Point Bonita incident the
1 r w pot b terrible scare, and going aft in
dy demanded that Becond Mate
Wagner be given cimmand of the ship
r, seeing that the Palmyra was
rushing to destruction with all sail set.
attempted to take command, and was
knocked down by Captain Keller.
Just at this moment Pilot Boyd board- ,
ed the bark and by ordering everything
aback Bayed the situation. Gradually
the land breeze filled the sails and the
Palmyra was backed far enough from the
dangerous Muff to make it practicable to
go about. Had the pilot been fifteen mln
â  . 'virk and her cargo would
have been a total loss.
The Palmyra made the run from New
castle. N. s. \\\. to San Francisco in the
..nty-nne days. Had Â«he
not been well found and a stout ship In
every respect she could never have wltn
stood the hurricane she. ran into soon
after leaving Australia. The sails were
blown into ribbons, the bulwarks carried
away her forefoot was washed off aud
she took a heavy list to port. After the
storm some of the damage was repaired
and the cargo straightened up and all
went well until the bark was a few days
from Han Francisco. Then Captain Keller
began to act queeriy, and while he ap
peared to know in which direction San
Francisco lay. he persisted in taking an
opposite course. The- men wanted Chief
Officer James Nash to take command ot
th< vessel, but he refused, saying the "old
man" would take them through the
Golden Gate all right. Shortly after this
the man on th--> look-out heard the roar
Of breakers ahead and a few minutes later
one of the crew saw a light on the port
bow It was the Point Keyes light ami
the Palmyra was going eight knots an
hour toward the beach. After, a great
deal ot hard work the crew, laboring as
they had never labored in their lives be
fore, the Palmyra was got about and tne
danger warn averted.
Getting down to the bar. f'aptain Keller
put the ship on a north-northwest course
and was heading with all sail set for the
bight in which the I.ancing nearly went
ashore a few months ago. Hie crew
gathered In the waist of the ship ana
b.-gan to discuss the situation, rrom ens
on they went to grumbling, and from
grumbling "to shouts of "You're running
us on the rocks." Then they turned to the
second mate and said:
â¢â¢For Ood'a Bake, Mr, Wagner, take
charge of the ship."
The second mate started in to do so and
was knocked down by the captain. I h<>n,
just as a general fracas was imminent,
the pilot got aboard and set everybody
at work putting the eails aback.
As soon as th>' Palmyra dropped anchor
and the sails were furled every member
of the crew, with the exception of the
first mate cook, cabin boy and carpenter,
left the snip in a body.
UNIDENTIFIED SUICIDE.
Plentiful Dose of Morphine Baffles
Physician's Labors.
An unknown man about 30 years of r\go
was brought into the Receiving Hospital
at 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon in the
throes of morphine poisoning. He was
found in an underground beer saloon near
tin northwest corner of Geary and
Kearny streets after having taken the
poison and was soon carried off to the
hospital.
Dr. McGettigan administered antidotes,
but scv. rer treatment was found neces
sary, and upon the arrival of Dr. Dray
artificial respiration was attempted. The
physicians and assistants worked over ihe
body for four hours, but their efforts
proved futile. A dram-sized bottle of
morphine was found In the suicide's
clothes, twenty grains of which had been
used.
The suicide was a man of mi-diiim
5-tature. light hair and had a dark red
mustache. His clothes were of good tex
ture, though show. lit; signs of wear. His
suit was of dark material and the coat
cut in the sack stile. Me wore a dark
blue flannel overshirt and a soft hat.
The body was taken to the Morgus,
where It will remain for identification.
A VISIT OF COURTESY.
Ohio Society of California Calls on
Major Strong at the Palace.
About fifty members of the Ohio Society
of California paid a visit of courtesy to

Federation of Clubs Will Try to Have
a Plank Inserted in Convention
Platforms.
A well-attended meeting of th<Â» Frrier
ation of Mission Improvement Clubs was
he Id at Graham's Hall on Alabama street
last night. President Chris Strader occu
pied the chair and Secretary Joseph P.
Tuohey was at his station. The action
of the Mayor in circumventing the Mar- !
ket Street Railroad Company in its at
tempt to remove the iron posts from the
Mis.-inn district and substitute wooden
ones in their stead was Indorsed.
The federation adopted a resolution
which recommended the insertion of a
plank in both the Republican and Demo
cratic party conventions for the better- j
ment ot ;:.â¢ Mission district. Among sug
>rfÂ«tionp was on> advanced by John T.
Graham, a property owner of the Precita

club of that section, to the effect that all ;
streets running south from Twenty-sixth,
between Valencia and Kentucky, be Â»on- I

in the neighborhood.
\ Dolores-streel boulevard leading to
the Golden Gate I'ark and other improve

An attempt was made by some of the
delegates to have their favorites Indorsed
for political positions before the various \
conventions, DUt this was voted down as
being not within the province of the club.

The Verdict Also Protests Against

We find that the said James Fra

pation pugilist, residence 210 Clara
street, in this city and county, came
to his death at the City Receiving
Hospital on the 17th of August,
1899, from shock following injury,
find we do further find that the in
juries from which death resulted
were inflicted by Frank McConnell
in a prize-fight conducted under the
auspices of the National Athletic
Association.
This jury also strongly deprecates
the granting of licenses by the Board
of Supervisors for such contests con
ducted for pecuniary profit.
We also protest against loaning
police officers to the protection of
prize-fights, the evidence in this case
showing that thirty out of the thirty
five patrolmen in the Mission district
were required at the fight at which
this man was killed, thus leaving the
entire Mission district perfectly un
protected for five hours.

and then he aimed a blow at McConnell.
but was countered on the face and fell
stiffly to the floor, striking upon his fore
head.
All the important witnesses were closely
cross-examined by Juror Watt. Mr. Watt
smiled cynically at the answers given by
some and dropped the witnesses without
ceremonj.
Frank McConnell, the victor, described
the fight as it appeared to him. He was
working at his trade as a shipwright, he
said, until two months ago, when he
knocked off work to train for the event
which proved so calamitous for poor Fra
ney. This was the witness' eleventh
fight. Franey fought furiously in all the
rounds and up to the time he received the
knock-out blow.
J. .1. Groom, manager of the National
Athletic Club, testified that the floor was
padded and the posts protected with hair
pillows so that the lighters might not
hurt themselves by falling. When asked
as to the personnel of the club he hesi
tated and gave the namos of the six di
rectors who constitute the club as fol
lows: Henry Smith. J. J. Groom, J. M.
Shannon, J. D. GibbÃ. Harry Piper and
J. P. Groom, brother of the witness.
Police Sergeant C. F. Klank, in reply
to a question by Juror Watt, ?ald that
thirty police officers, all from the Mission
district, hud been detailed to attend the
light and keep order.
"Do you take the patrolmen off their
regular beats?" asked Mr. Watt.
"Yes."
"And so that portion of the city is left
unprotected while the fight goes on?"
The witness made no reply. He said
the officers did not like the detail because
their duties were very disagreeable. Of
ficer C. 11. Taylor, the next witness, dwelt
upon this feature of the work. People
objected to being pushed about by the
officers in their efforts to keep the aisles
clear and preserve order, one man say
ing that he was a reporter, another that
he was a doctor, another a lawyer, an
other a Judge, and so on. There were
thirty-five patrolmen in tho Mission dis
trict'and thirty of these were on duty at
the fight.

of condition. M'-Connell said that he re
ceived 65 per cent of 50 tier cent of the
gate receipts and Franey's representa
tives received the remaining 35 per cent
of the 50 per cent.
Dr. Zabala told the jury what he had
found at the autopsy. All the organs
were in good condition except that there
were pleuritic adhesions which probably
would not have been discovered on a su
perflcial examination.
Dr. D. D. Jyustig, who made an examin
ation of the men before the fight, insisted
that there was nothing the matter with
Franey and that he was in perfect condi

PRESIDENT RIPLEY HERE
CAME TO INSPECT THE VALLEY
ROAD PROPERTY.
The Head of a Great Railroad System
Discusses Matters of Vital In
terest to the People of
This State.
A distinguished party of Santa Fr of
ficials arrived in the city yesterday from
Los Angeles after making a tour of in
spection over the Valley road. It consists
of President E. P. Ripley, A. F. Walker,
chairman of the board of directors, who
arrived in this city some days ago from
a pleasure trip to Honolulu and went
down the road as far as Bakersneld to
meet President Ripley and accompany him
back; J. M. Earr, third vice president; \V.
(j. Hodges, purchasing agent; John Play
er of Topeka, superintendent of machin
ery; W. G. Ne'vtn, general manager of the
Santa Fe Pacific and Southern California
Ruilruad, and Ford Harvey of Kiins.i-
Ciiy. Captain I'ayson, vice president of
the Valley road; W. A. Bissell, assistant
traffic manager of the Santa Fe, and W.
B. Storey, general superintendent and
chief engineer of the valley road, went
(inwn the line to meet their noted guests
and returned with them to this city.
When Keen yesterday in the "fliers of
the Valley road President Ripley said that
the general purpose of his visit to the
coast was to go over the property which
his road had acquired when it absorbed
the Valley road property and see for him
self the general .state in which the new
investment was to be found. Not only
was this iiis object in coming here, but
li. wished t" acquaint himself by personal
Inspection with everything connected with
the Santa Fe as well.
In regard to the nften mooted proposi
tion that the Valley road acquire a ter
minal point in Oakland, Mr. Ripley said
that it was altogether too early to discuss
that matter now. All the energy of the
Santa Fe people is, for the present, direct
ed toward the completion of the plans of
the Valley road branch ;is far a.s they are
now laid out, and seeing that that road
gets into San Francisco by the Ist of next
January. What may happen after that,
he said, he did not know, but a.s yet no
steps had been taken toward anything
that might be construed into an attempt
to Becure an Oakland terminal.
Mr. Ripley had practically the same an
swers for questions pertaining to the pro
posed branch lines of the Valley road to
ward Sacramento and to tap the fruit
raising country In the vicinity of Winters.
It was altogether too early in the game
for any definite plans in these directions
to have been formed, though what time
might bring forth he was not prepared to
say The Santa Fe system was out for
business, he said, and would certainly go
wherever it was to be found. Even if it
should be made apparent that another line
of trans-Pacific steamers would be a pay
ing investment the Orient would not be
considered too far for the Santa Fe peo
ple to stretch from this port.
The freight line that the Santa Fe al
ready owns, and which runs from San
Diego to China and Japan, has proved a
veritable mine, and it is not improbable
that the success that has attended this
venture may tempt its owners to compete
with the Pacific Mail for the freight and
passenger business out of San Francisco,
particularly since the acquisition of the
Philippines by the United States has
opened up such a new and extensive fleid
of commercial research.
The line to the Grand Canyon is being
pushed with the utmost vigor, and though
the work on it is not being done by the
Santa Fe people, yet they have entered
into agreements with its owners which
promise them a very fair slice of the busi
ness it is expected to do.
Mr. Ripley will probably visit Point
Richmond to-morrow and inspect the
work that has boen accomplished there,
particularly that on the big Franklin tun
jiel. He will then return to the city, and
after a day or two devoted to general
matters he will return to his home in the
East.

Dr. Kinyoun Refused to Allow Officer
Cohn Aboard â Manuel Lopez
Stood Up and Robbed by
Footpads.
The harbor police .ire trying hard tn
break up a pang- of hoodlums that if> en
dangering- life and property on the ferry
steamers. The gang is composed of about
fifty or sixty young- men who work on
this side of the bay and whose homos
are in Oakland. Berkeley and Alameda.
They meet every night on the 6 o'clock
boat and as soon as they are aboard be
gin their devilment. Many of them work
in the foundries and their pockets are
always filled with nails and bolt heads.
These they throw into the crowd and
numbers of people are hurt every night.
Another favorite trick of theirs is to
throw ripe tomatoes among the people,
and rtill another is baiting the Chinese
passengers. Two or three times a week
they nut the line that keeps the passen
gers back while the apron is being low
ered and then rush ashore before the
steamer is tied up. Friday night they
knocked two little boys down in their
rush and the crowd following on behind
nearly trampled the lads to death before
they were rescued.
Warrants are out for all the ringleaders
and yesterday Tony Caster, an iron
worker, and Rob Williams, who works at
Shreve's, were arrested. They were
charged with disturbing the peace. Every
night for the next month two police of
ficers will travel on the 6 p. m. boat and
will arrest all the boys for whom war
rants are out and any others, who may be
caught in mischief.
The steamer Peru, from Panama, and
the Aztec, from the Orient, reached port
yesterday. The Peru was quarantined, as
one of the passengers had a mild case of
yellow fever. The ship was fumigated
and about 4 p. m. went to the Mail dock.
She was twenty-one days from Panama
and way ports and brought up twelve
steerage passengers and the following in
the cabin:

There is some lively betting among the
pilots as to who will bring in the Sherman
with the California boys aboard. Captains
F. W. Jordan. Swanson, Murphy and Ty
son each thinks he will be he lucky man.
Their chances are about equal, as all
will be on the outside station. Captain
Jordan took the boys out on the City of
Peking and he says the job of bringing
them in is his by right. Alec Swanson
says that he will bring them in because
luck is his way this month. Murphy and
Tyson arc saying nothing, but each is
confident that he will pilot the boys in
through the Golden Gate.
Manuel Lopes of 405 Pacific street was
treated at the Harbor Receiving Hospital
early yesterday morning for some bruises
he received from two footpads while on
his way home. The robbers accosted him
at thp corner of Jackson street and Mont
gomery avenue and wanted to know the
time. As he took out his watch they
knocked him on the head and robbed him
while unconscious of $10. his go.d watch
and a photograph of his wife. Ixipez was
formerly engaged as a stenographer for
John Wanamakor and is going to Ma
nila to act in a similar capacity for the
Government. The police are on the trail
of the robbers.

ONE CONTRIBUTION
HAS GONE ASTRAY
Joy has filled the hearts of the members
of the finance committee. The rapid
growth of the fund and the substantial
proportions it has reached have been a
source of satisfaction to every one con
nected with the reception. With but a
very few exceptions the people of all sec
tions have responded liberally and cheer
fully to the appeals of Mr. de Young's
committee. At the meeting yesterday the
most encouraging reports came from the
outside districts. The fund will far exceed
the $50,000 figure, which was the original
goal of the committee. Over in Oakland
\Y. O. Palmanteer of the Central Bank
has undertaken to raise a handsome con-
tribution from the citizens, and reported
yesterday that he was meeting with lib
eral responses from all quarters.
Something has gone wrong with a fund
that was raised at a benefit given by the
Rathbone sisters of Santa Rosa. A big
amount was realized, but no one seems to
know what has become of it. The com
mittee has received a communication ask
ing why the contribution had not been
acknowledged, and it developed that the
money had never been received.
ON THE DAY THE
FIRST COMES HOME
Lee Johnson, the popular song writer,
whose latest success. "On the Day That
Dewey Comes Home," has written to fit
that air another sonc entitled "On the
Day the First Comes Home." It is dedi
cated to the Native Sons and Daughters,
and will be sung at the Alhambra Thea
ter on the nights of the benefits for the
returning volunteers. Here it is:
There'll be a Brand sight â
Fresh from the iisht.
Our boys come home to stay;
Colors flying, bands a playing,
A Krand old holiday.
We'll all turn out,
The boys Will shout,
Anil welcome each their own;
The streets will be covered with floweis,
On the day the First comes home.
CHORUS.
Won't we have a lush old time .
fOn the day the first comes home;
All of pood old Frisco town
Will be their very own.
Each mother will hue and kiss
And bless her favorite son,
And then there'll be a hot time in Frisco,
On th? day the First comes home.
They're all rightâ who's all right?
The Firstâ our boys, our sons-;
Courage, valor, found not wanting.
Honored by the ones at home.
They stood the battle's brunt.
Always to the front.
In the trenches and the tropic sun.
They told their little story to the natives,
Did our boys behind the guns.
Johnson, who has written any number
of popular successes, including "Ma Hon
olulu Lady" and "The Belle ol Honolulu."
has cut loose from music publishers atul
branched out for himself. Hereafter his
own presses will print his compositions,
N''xi w -i k will witness the publication of
four new songs that seem to contain all
the elements of popularity. Their titles
arc; "Ma Honolulu Man," "Dat Coon,
lie Don't Love Me." "Move On, Mr. Nlu
ger. Move .On" and "Mammy's Carolina
Twins." Josephine Gassman, who was
favored with a manuscript copy of the
"Carolina Twins," Ims made a hit with it
in the East.
COLONEL DUBOCE

turn on the Sherman, has been appointed
major of one of the volunteer regiments
now being mustered in. Colonel Duboce

DESERTED BY
HER HUSBAND
Brief Wedded Bliss
Ended.
EACH ACCUSES THE OTHER
THE FORSAKEN WIFE HAS BEEN
TWICE DIVORCED.
Thought She Had Met Her Ideal In
Her Last Matrimonial Venture,
but Finds She Erred
â \ Again.
Thrice married, once the complainant
and once the respondent In suits for di- I
vorce and now deserted by her last hus
âsuch In brief is a recital of the re
markable, not to say sensational, marital
experiences of Mrs. Dr. Franklin T. Dun- j
can, all occurring in less than eight years. |
Mrs. Duncan is very well known lr. San J
Francisco, as is also her present husband.
She has held a high position in the select !
boclal circles of the local Four Hundred,
while Dr. Duncan was considered among- j
the most promising of the younger phy
sicians. -
Readers of The Call will member the
eensation caused about a year ago by the
romantic wedding of the young couple.
Mrs. Duncan had but a short time previ- ]
ously been divorced from her second hus- !
band, George Burnett, the well known ;
druggist* and Dr. Duncan had been named
in the husband's complaint as co-respond- j
ent. One day a short time after the judi
cial decree had been granted divorcing !
.Burnett from his wife the latter and Dr.
Duncan surprised their friends by making
a quiet trip to Reno, Xev., where they
were married.
The union gave promise of being a.
happy one and Mrs. Burnett-Duncan was j
wont often to say that at last she had
found her Ideal. The attentive husband !
jrave expression to similar pleasant
thoughts. But alsa! love's young dream
has !>een dissipated and Mrs. Duncan's
latest marriage appears to promise a no
more pleasant sequel than did her previ
ous ventures.
Of all her marriages, the first was prob
ably the happiest for Mrs. Duncan. About
MRS. DR. FRANKLIN T. DUNCAN.
years ago she was married to M.
Grantlt, a merchant of this city, young,
â¢ a good family. For one
â¢ irs the couple lived pleasantly
ther, but alter a time quarrels arose,
â | h< husband charged his wife with lead
i gay a life, while she on her
cused him ni p
too much attention to other women.
Wh'-tiior the I - hnro
â¢ â â  of truth Is of
no c<>: Suffice it to say that a
divorce followed. Subsequently both hue
.-,n<l wife remarried, and. strai
gay, the husbar.l Is now divorced from his
second wife, i iving permitted her t"
have the custody of a little daughter.
After having bi en divorced from hÂ»r
firm husband Mrs. Grantit became Mrs.
George liurnett. Burnett is the son of
<;eorge W. Burnett, the pioneer druggist
of this city, who un;'i recently had con
ducted a pharmacy on Montgomery street
since the time when th. water came up to
that thoroughfare. lie s now established
on Turk street and is reputed to be a
millionaire.
For nearly four years Mr and Mrs. Bur
nett lived happily, and a iltue daughter
â¢was born to them. Then Dr. Duncan came
into Mrs. Burnett's life. lie was a friend
of the husband and had been called in to
attend Mrs. Burnett for a slight ailment.
H" was a young man of polished man
ners, suave and of good appear, nee. He
had but recently graduated fron, college,
and at once paid Mrs. Burnett marked at
tention. Burnett was called away on a
business trip to Los Angeles, and inuring
.sence, as was subsequently brought
out at the trial for divorce, the y> ung
physician practically lived at the Bun ett
hr>me.
The result has already been told. Mr;.
Burnett once more ventured upon tho
troublous sea of matrimony, changing her
to Duncan. That was less than a
ago. and again Is she. alone. Her
husband for two weeks past has refused
to live with her. Accusations of a very
Berious nature have been made on both
sides, and the probabilities are that an
suit for divorce wil! shortly be com
menced.
I>r. Duncan is In this city and his wife
Is enjoying herself at Congress Springs.
))r. I'uncan wi'l probabiy be best remem
bered in this cltv as the former proprietor
of tho pharmacy at 119-121 Ellis street.
Lecture on the Philippine.
Sergeant Andreae and Private Reeves,

which was entitled "Truths From the

A Minnesota man captured a king

known to abound, and set at liberty.
The bird poises high in the air, and,

Services at the Synagogues
Next Month.
In th* musical world It Is abovÂ© all the
presentation of "Fidelio" that demands
particular attention, not so much because
of the quality of the performance as on
account of the enterprise and ambition
that Inspired the management of the
Tivoli to present a work that would other
wise remain In obscurity as far as San
Francisco is concerned. Max Hirschfeld
deserves no small amount of credit for
the prominent part he has taken in bring
ing about this result, and the music lovers
of this city owe the Tivoli management a
deep debt of gratitude in enabling them
t.> listen to Beethoven's masterpiece. That
it was a very creditable performance no
one who heard it will deny, and Mary
Linck particularly is entitled to praise. Of
course, the orchestra, having the lion's
share of the responsibility, must also re
ceive the lion's share of the praise to be
distributed.
"11 Trovatore" brought back Miss Ella
Prossnitz, who labored under great dis
advantages when first appearing in
"Alda," inasmuch as she was afflicted
with a severe cold. Throughout the past
week this able vocalist demonstrated the
fact that she is not only a well-schooled
artist who employs an ideal method, but
that she possesses a dramatic soprano of
unusual range and intense dramatic
timbre. As st.ited before, the lady, be-
Bides possessing well developed artistic
accomplishments, is an actress of consid
erable dramatic temperament, which en
dows her performance with a spirit and
dash that make it truly enjoyable. This
week will bring the ever-delightful doable
â¢ â¢ill. 'Cavalleria Ruatlcana" and "i Pag
llacci." The latter w..rk especially be
comes more interesting the longer we lis
ten to it. ;m<] with Salassa as Tonio it
will be doubly enjoyable.
The friends oi Rhys Thomas will, no
doubt, feel gratified to hear that h>- has
been engaged, as tenor for tin Castie
iquare opera Company i:<xt season at
Chicago. Jt seems that he has not yet
1 lost any of his prestige as an operatic
â singer. With him will go Miss Bernlce
Hoimes, who has been often heard to ad
vantage at tho TivolJ Opera-house.
Another California artist who Is about
to win laurels in tho Bast is .Miss Hilda
Newman of Oakland, whose ability as a
pianist has been acknowledged by all who
have heard her and are competent to
. judge. She will act at the same tim<* as
! accompanist to the Xew York Ladies' Trio
i and will tour this coast with the organi
zation some time next fall.
Among those who will go abroad to
Study this fall is Frank Coffin, the popular
tenor. He, together with Robert Blen
another well-known vocalist, will leave
, for London In a few months. After hay
! ing studied there for some time they will
; go to Paris, where they expect to com
| plete their studies. The friends of Mr.
< orfln are thinking of arranging a benefit
i concert for him ere his departure.

S.,me of the members of tho old Phil
harmonic orchestra are hard at work re
organizing this aide body of musicians
! Mr. Genss has been approached in the
matter of accepting the leadership, and
there seems to be every reason to believe
that the new organization is assured. A
I <tter man than Genss could hardly be
fÂ».und here, especially since Bcheel will be
busy with the Symphony orchestra.
Ji-nry Holmes has organized a string

Miss Grace Carroll, one of Oakland's
â  most prominent musi. inns and a contralto

] roll is inspired by the praiseworthy desire
to confine her studies to America, and not
imitate the unwarranted fad of studying
abroad. Considering the many opportuni
ties presented to our students in this
country, there is no reason to go to Ku

PROFESSOR MIEHLING COWERS
BEFORE A SHRIMP OF AN ACTOR
GEORGE MIEHLING, the Her
cules of the Olympic Club, ap
pears to be going back. In his
career on the mat he has thrown
almost everything from five aces
to a Terrible Swede, which makes it all
the more difficult for his friends to under
stand the ease with wnich he has been
downed during the wet-K by a shrimp of
an actor at the California Theater. It
can only be accounted for on the ground
that Miehling is not familiar with the
rules of wrestling laid down by Shakes
peare.

HOPELESSLY CRIPPLED
BY A FILIPINO BULLET
JOHN W. SLADE was the only mem
ber of the First California Regiment
who lost a limb in service. He went
away to the land of the wily Filipino
1 sound and hopeful with his comrades and
! to-day he is in this city helpless and with
', out funds for necessary surgical treat
ment. Others of his regiment died on the
battle-field, and some who still live have
felt the sting of the Mauser bullet, but
i John is a hopeless cripple for life, hav
ing had one leg removed on February 6,
after it had been shattered by a pellet
from a brass Remington in the hands of
ian enemy. It has been recently discove
! ered that the amputation, which was per
formed In the United States hospital at
San Pedro Macatl, was a bungling job
and that in order to save the life of the
soldier the knife must again be applied.
For this purpose a grand benefit will be
given at the Alhambra Theater on Sep
tember 2, for which volunteer talent is
solicited.
John W. Slade was a waiter in the Pal
! ace Hotel when the first martial rumble
sounded over the land. On June 5, 1898,
j he gave up his position and became a. sol
! dier. Through his influence eleven other
members of the Pacific Coast Waiters'
Association did likewise. He participated
in the principal battles of the war and. in
February fell after having distinguished
himself as a fighter. His left leg was
taken off below the knee and he was
brought back to this city. Shortly after
his arrival it was discovered that another
I amputation would be necessary to pre
serve his' life, as the surgeons at San Pe
' dro had failed In their operation. Mem
bers of the Pacific Coast Waiters' Asso
ciation have undertaken the grand enter-
I tainment referred to. the proceeds, of
which will be given to their unfortunate
companion. Any one disposed to donate
( services may confer with E. R. -Moss,
manager, at room 209, Emma Sprockets
building. The benefit will be elaborate
and a snug little sum will probably be
I netted by it. R. Porter Ashe called yes
; terday at the rooms of the committee hav
ing the benefit in charge and purchased
j the first box, paying $20 for.it.

News.
In "As You Like It," as every one
knows, one of the characters is
"Charles," the Duke'? wrestler, who has
a reputation bespangled with the medals
offered by the Hermann Oelrichs of that
day. He is the whole thing and some to
spare. The practice now followed by
heavyweight pugilists or offering coin to
such young fellows as can stand before
them was instituted by him. Up till the
time "Orlando" showed on the second
scene, "Charles" was it.
Now, when T. Daniel Prawley and
Blanche Bates cast about for one worthy
of taking the part of Charles, their
eyes rested on George Miehling, the San
dow of San Francisco. When they ap
proached him with the offer of an engage
ment he shied like a soubrette at a small
bottle. They coaxed and offered all sorts
of inducements until Miehling announced
that if it was not for the length of the
speaking part, he would tackle the job.
To T. Daniel and Miss Bates the rest was
easy.
"We'll cut it out," they said, "and they
did, from the "Godmorrow to your wor
ship," where Charles makes his first ap
pearance to the "so God keep your wor
ship," where he makes his first exit.
"Oliver" did ull the talking necessary,
while "Charles" Miehling struck some
Post street attitudes and thought he
thought. In the second scene, where it
was absolutely necessary for him to talk
and wrestle, it was arranged that he
should pose on the "prompt" side, where
the few necessary packages of words
could be shut to him irom the wings.
All being ready "Orlando" was trotted
on in the person of Alfred Hickman.
Peeled for the bout, the young actor ap
peared no match for the Samson to whom
he was soon to be opposed. He was so
badly handicapped that one dramatic
cricket has publicly announced that he
won tier sympathy from the start. Poor
fellow!
"Orlando," despite tils physical.inferior
ity, appeared as confident as if facing a
picture machine. He exchanged bon mots
with the members of the ducal party, not
forgetting "Charles." Of course "Charles"
had to reply. He started, stuck out hia
eyea and moved his lips. No sound issued
fnan between. His tongue could not
utter what his memory did not hold. At
th>- crucial moment Miehling had forgot
ten his lines. Donnerwettcri
A muttered growl came from the wings
to liis ears.
"Make a motion with your arm as if you
were ordering zwei beers and say: 'Come;
where is this young gallant that is so de
sirou? to lie with his motiier earth?' "
Miehling's right described a graceful cir
cle and he repeated the line; the Duke
and "Orlando" filled In a few more, by
which time the prompter had recharged
"Charles" with his last utterance on the
boards. Then time was called for the
bout.
The sympathies of the dramatic crickets
and the deep feeling of revenge that pos
sessed "Orlando" against the Duke, whose
cruelty was soon to compel Blanche Bates
to wander around In cherry-colored tights

COOPER'S GAME RIDE.
Wins the Mile Professional Event at
Manhattan Beach.
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â Tom Cooper in
creased his lead for the National Cycling
Association championship by winning the
mile professional race at Manhattan
Beach this afternoon. It was a race that
brought the spectators in the grand stand
to their feet, cheering until the very
building shook. Of the twenty-four start
ers the slower ones had been weeded out
in preliminary heats, and the fliersâ Kiser,
Cooper, Sims, Kimble and Stevens â lined
up at last for the final struggle.
A pacemaker was put in to carry them
three laps, and they followed him at a
merry clip, with Stevens leading. Cooper,
Klser, Kimble and Sims following in the
order named. Toward .end Kimbie
ran high up on the bank, and as he came
down the slope he shot past the others
like the wind. Before they knew what
had happened he was twenty yards ahead.
Cooper started out to overhaul him, and
Kiser clung desperately to Cooper's rear
wheel. At the last turn Cooper came
alongside, and Kiser started his famous
lope in the sprint down the home-stretch.
Inch by inch be drew up on Cooper, who
had sprinted without pace for a quarter
of a mile, but he began too late, and Coop
er flashed across the tape a winner by
two feet, with Kiser second, Kimble third,
Stevens fourth and Sims fifth. |
Their standing in the championship ta
ble at presnt is: Cooper 39, Kiser 20, Kim
ble 20, Stevens 18. Summary:
Manhattan handicap, two miles, profes
sionalâWon by B. H. Kiser, 30 yards;
Bob Walthour, 30 yards, second; J. T.
Fisher, 30 yards, third. Time, 4:30 2-5.

DAVIS IN GREAT FORM.
Harvard Tennis Expert Easily De
feats Kreigh Collins.
NEWPORT, H. L, Aug. lit.â The interest
in the national lawn tennis tournament to
day cent. red in the semi-final m&tchec.
The contest between tho Westerner,
Kreigh Collins, and Dwight Davis, the
Harvard player, proved a surprise even to
admirers of the Harvard man, for he
fairly ran away with his opponent in tho
first two sets. His smashing was terrific
and left Collins little chance to save him
self. The Western ex-champion pulled
out four games in the first set, -but the
second ended 6âl in favor of Davis. Tlie
third set developed into a fierce and long
struggle. Davis kept up his smashing tac
tics with a speed that seemed to bewilder
his opponent. Collins scored, however,
and for the iirst time in the match seemed
to gauge Davis' play. Deuces resulted,
but Davis started in with renewed force
and won >> â ti.
The Paret-Ware match furnished ex
citing sport. The first was a deuce set.
resulting in favor of Paret 7â5. The sec
ond went to Paret &â 2. In the third sel
Ware made a better showing than in the
preceding. Paret won 6 â 4. This will
bring Davis and Paret together in tho
finals.
In the semi-final round of the consola
tion singles Little defeated Budlong, frâ 3,
10 â 8. Summary;
Championship BLogles, srmi-final round â J. P.

ANOTHER CHANCE FOR McCOY.
Opportunity to Redeem Himself With
Jack McCormack.
CHICAGO, Aug. 19.â Kid McCoy and
Jack McCormack are to meet again in the
ring. It is indefinite just when the fight
will take place, but unless a 20-round bout
is arranged in the East the men will meet
here for six rounds on September S. Mc-
Coy said to-day:
"Th*> blow that sent me to the floor last
night was an acddi :H. as is acknowledged
by every one and by McCormack himself.
Still, it is the chance of such things that
every boxer must guard against, and I
was beaten fairly."
Tommy Ryan failed to keep his appoint
ment to-day to arrange a match between
himself and McCoy. He is reported to
have said that the outcome of last night's
fight had so injured McCoy's drawing
power that a match between them would
not draw $500. McCoy posted $1000 to bind
a match with Ryan.

A RECORD-BREAKING BASS.
Cemmissioner Vogelsang Lands a
Fine Prize Near Oakland.
To Alex Vogelsang, president of the
State Game and Fish Commission, is due
the credit of landing the largest striped
bass with a light tackle. He made his
record-breaking catch on Friday in the
Oakland estuary, and when the bass was
weighed it was found to turn the scales
at twenty-five pounds. While it may be
true that one or two fish weighing a
pound or so more than Vogelsang's prize
have been taken in these waters, none
have been taken under conditions that
would let them enter into a record com
petition. The larger of the Jish have been
caught on huge lines that would hold a
shark and v>ith poles that cduld be made
to serve as flagstaffs. Vogelsang's outfit
was one that has seen service for steel
head catching and was rated as one of the
I smallest that that sport would permit of.
Vogelsang and Al Wilson went to the
fishing grounds late in the day, and for a
time they were fearful that they were
doomed to be "skunked" so far as getting
I any lish was concerned. At last the Com
missioner felt a bite, and he struck quick
and strong. The next moment he be-
I lieved that he had hooked a small whale,
and the line went spinning out for nearly
seventy-five yards, while the pole seemed
ready to Dreak. The victim on the end of
the -line fought stubbornly for nearly
! twenty minutes and was only landed when
I exhausted. The prize was on exhibition
yesterday at tiie rooms of the commis
sion. ___^^______
CROWDS WILL COME
FROM ALL SECTIONS
Reports from all sections of the State
indicate. that on the day of the reception
| celebration San Francisco will be called
upon to 'entertain 1 the 'greatest concourse
oi people ever assembled here. .
Sacramento will be represented by at
least two militia companies, two or more
societies and a band, besides a bit; ner
j centage of her population. Company, G
of the Second Infantry and Troop B of
cavalry will attend in force. Both coun
cils of the Young Men's Institute in
Sacramento have received invitations
from the San Francisco councils to at
i tend and have determined to accept.
Stockton will be well represented at the
! reception to be tendered the First Call-'
' forma. Among the fraternal organiza
tions the Woodmen of the World have led
the way. At their lodge meeting last
night a committee was appointed to rep- j
resent the lodge and other orders will fol- j
low suit. Companies A and B will make a j
strong effort tb turn out.
That Stockton will send a tremendous ;
crowd to the reception there is no doubt.
The steamboat companies are already
making plans to handle a heavy business, I
while the railroad company already
notes an increased passenger traffic. Â» r
Vallejo will not participate to any great
extent in the welcome to the returning
volunteers as a city, owine to the fact
that she is in the midst of preparations
for the reception and entertainment of the
I officers and men of the Boston upon her
arrival. However, a large delegation of
the Foresters of America will represent
Vallejo in the parade in San Francisco.
Santa Cruz will be' well represented at
the home-coming of the California volun
teers by Mayor Lamb and a large delega
tion of citizens. Interest' here in regard
to the home-coming is great, as many
Santa Cruz boys are in the service of their
I country not in the California volunteers
i but most of them in the navy.
Redwood City will turn out en masse
upon the soldiers' return.
While no official action has yet been
taken in Sacramento in the way of recog
nition of the home-coming of the Califor-
I nia volunteers, it is certain that the cele
! bration in San Francisco will draw thou
sands of people from that city and sec
tion of the State.
Santa Rosa will without doubt be well
! represented at the celebration. As to
! whether or not the city will be officially
represented it is impossible yet to say.
The people of San Jose are going to do
their snare in welcoming home the heroes
of the First California Regiment, and. sev
eral thousand residents will come to San
Francisco at that time. There are quite a
number of San Jose boys in the regiment, I
and these will be particularly looked
after.
The members of Sea Point Parlor No.
15S, Native Sons of the Golden West, of
Bausalito have about completed arrange
ments under the direction of William
Hannon, to participate in the welcome
extended the California volunteers on
their return home, and expect to be quite
a feature in the grand street parade in
j San Francisco. The parlor will be es
| corted to the metropolis by Richardson's
â  band.
While the people of Los Angeles will not
Irate locally the return of the Califor
nia volunteers from the Philippines, a del
egation of at least forty prominent citi
zens will leave for this city on Tuesday.
| The principal organizations to be repre-
I sented and the names of their respective
representatives are as follows: Chamber
of Commerce, E. F. C. Klokke. O. T. John- !
son and General C. C. Allen: Board of 'â 
Trade, Fred L. Baker, Max Meyberg. J
J. Bergin. Max Goldschmidt arid J. C. Me- |
Keeby; Merchants' and Manufactures' As
sociation, H. W. Frank, D. W. Kirkland,
J. W. Hutchison, Byron Erkenbrecher, C.
Laux and F. J. Zeehandelar; war board,
J. R. Xewberry. John F. Francis and J. O.
Koepfli: First Brigade, N. G. C. Captain 1
C. M. Baker and Major J. H. Dockweiler.
The Chamber of Commerce and the
Hundred Thousand Club, Fresno, leading
commercial organizations, will be among
the visitors from that city to greet the
returning volunteers. There is some talk
of establishing Fresno headquarters in
San Francisco on the date of the cele
bration.

Didn't Want Any Preface.
The mother of a little Boston boy, visit
ing friends on Capitol Hill, rounded the
kid up when he appeared for breakfast
the other morning . â  â 
"Wendall," she said to him, "you will
recall that, upon the second evening- of
our arrival . here, I forbade you reading
Herbert Spencer and Huxley at night by
the light of the pas in the room set aside
for you, on account of the heating prop
erties of the illuminating fluid. You have
disobeyed me, and I am about to punish
you. I am very sorry to have to â "
"I beg of you to eliminate the preamble,"
replied the kid. "Punitive measures in
flicted conversationally create a distinct
sense of fatigue within me. At any rate
I pray you to reserve your' didactic dis
course until after the application of the
birch."
Then the slipper fell, and. the kid bawled
almost like something human.

patient. I sent word to him only three
quarters of an hour ago that I should be

and "rookies" in barracks and in camp
at the Presidio Reservation have been aug
mented by the arrival of 350 recruits for
the Thirty-sixth and Thirty-seventh vol
unteer regiments now being organized in
Manila. They arrived at the Presidio Fri
day night in charge of Captain Wtesef
and Lieutenant Wilke of the Seventh Ar
tillery, Second Lieutenants Wing, Davis

occasional loss of some of the smuil
pieces. The guns come in 1000 pieces, and
the loss of even one small bolt causes de
lay, as it has to be replaced directly from
the factory. .

your lodge and found he had been suffering
from rheumatism and lumbago since Novem

THE COMMON PRESS GALLERY.
Accounts of Its Work. History and
Occupants by the Speaker of
the House.
The thirty-sixth anniversary dinner of the
Newspaper Press Fund was held recently
at the Whitehall Hnoma, Hotel Metropole,
The Speaker, the Right Hon. William
Court (Jully, presided.
The loyal toasts having been honored,
the chairman proposed "Prosperity to the
Newspaper Press Fund." He said that it
seemed to have been a common practice
in introducing that toast to begin with
some observation on the virtues, the vices
âif there were anyâ and the functions of
the press, if he abstained from this habit
it was partly because, he did not feel him
self to be a competent critic, and partly
because the press had quite recently re
ceived probably as much valuable advice
and criticism from persons more compe
tent than himself to pronounce on these
matters as it was able to digest at pres
ent. He imagined that he had been asked
tv take the chair on that occasion because
lie had the official control of the press gal
lery of the House of Commons, which he
understood was the origin and birthplace
of the Press Fund. Reviewing the history
of the press gallery, he said he would go
back to the days when Dr. Johnson com
pMS.il the speeches both for her Majesty's
Ministers ;u:d the Opposition, taking care,
as he observed, that "the Whig dogs did
not get the best of the argument."
That was not what would be called re
porting nowadays. Reporting did not, as
now understood, begin till the latter part
of the last century. He reflected a tth sat
isfaction that one of the Incidents which
brought about the change from the de
nial of the claim to report the debates to
tree reporting was the tragic incident that
one of his predecessors was burned in
effigy by a mob in the city of London in
\'~,Z in a riot which arose cut of the claim
by the House of Commons to arrest a per
son who had been printing their proceed
ings without their leave. It was said
that the blood of the martyrs was the
s"ed of the church, and he hoped he
might claim that from the ashes of a
Speaker had sprung the freedom of print-
Ing, which waa treasured as much as the
right of debate itself. The House came
to the sensible, conclusion that It was a
benefit to the House, as It was to the pub
lic that, Instead of being 111, furtively and
sometimes maliciously reported, Its pro
ceedings should be openly and truthfully
reported. As far as his researches had
gone, however, the first trace he could
find of the history of the reporter's gal
lery was in 1878, when evidence was given
before a committee of the House of Com
mons by a gentleman whom many present
would remember, Mr. Ross of the Tlmea
and he said that his recollection went
back fifty-eight years, to the year 1820.
In the old House of Commons the ac
commodation which the reporter received
said Mr. Ross was in the back bench in
the Strangers' Gallery, with his head
three feet from the celling, in a wretched
atmosphere, with all the strangers talk-
Ing, and In sight of on^j r two-thirds of
the House. That was reporting under
difficulties. There waa no desk to rest
a notebook on. In that way they con
tinued to report until the House was
burned down in 1534. Mr. Charles Dickens
waa president at the second annual ban
quet of the fund In 1865. and in his ad
dress he gave experiences in that old
gallery, in which he reported from 1831
to 1835. That Included the exciting times
of the first Reform bill, and he said he
well remembered how he wore out his
trouser knees writing with his notebook
on them on that old back bench, thus
confirming what Mr. Ross had said. Just
as the independence of reporting waa
ushered In by the burning of a Speaker,
so the burning of the House of Com
mons brought reporters another benefit.
There was provided for the first time a
reporters' gallery, with actually a desk
or a slab In front on which reporters
could place their books. That was
thought to be a great convenience, and
so it was. When the present House came
to be occupied everybody seemed satis
fied. From that time there had been but
one alteration.
In 1878. after inquiry, an effort was
made to give accommodation which
should Include the provincial press, and
as a result some portion of the side gal
leries was given to the press, and many
provincial papers were admitted. At the
present time thore were directly repre
sented in the press galleries about twenty
London dally papers and about thirty
provincial papers, and the total number
of Journalists having the entry to the
gallery was about 240. As the represen
tative of the House of Commons, he
claimed that the House was now up to
date In this matter. He appreciated the
ImDortance of trivlntf accommodation to
the press and to best of its ability it had
done bo, for it considered ihat the pro
vision of proper accommodation for the
press was an important and vital part of
its duties. Speaking of the Newspaper
Press Fund, he said it was an Institution
of the most valuable kind. He appealed
for general support and liberality on Its
behalf. The profession of the press was
of an extremely arduous and precarious
character. It was one in which there
were few great prizes, and there were
comparatively few members who made
substantial savings. It was carried on
under conditions which were ofter injur
ious to health. It involved a great and
continuous strain.
It often involved irregular hours and
irregular meals, bad air "and fatigue, and j
other things; which exposed even the ]
most careful to illness and breakdown. \
It was the object of the Props Fund to
give that help \jhlch waa needed in such '
cases. All agreed that the press was al- i
most as necessary to them nowadays us I
were food and clothing. In a civilized j
country we could not pot on without it. |
and they In England, who were accus
tomed to a press conducted under hon
orable traditions, would not be happy If I
they thought the press was miserable
and degraded or if it were not carried ;
on by jrentlemen in the spirit of gentle
men. The Press Fund had every claim,
both for lta past history and its useful
ness, to the support of the public. It de- j
rived a substantial Income from the i
members of the fund, and In thirty-six '
years, in spite of having disbursed large :
sums for the support of Its members, it ]
has accumulated a considerable amount '
of capital, from which a substantial in- |
come was drawn.
TOWN HOSPITALS
As Necessary to Public Welfare as
Schools and Libraries.
"Scarce a village is too small for public
buildings for education, for the adminis
tration of tho law, for religious instruc- i
tlon and for amusements; but how imuv/ \
are the towns that can show a hospital 0 '
asks Helen C. Candee, in the Woman's
Home Companion, writing of "The Need
Of Town Hospitals," and telling how to
start one. "Mutters are very fell for the
Bfck In comfortable homes, where the in
valid is given a room, is nursed by the
most efficient member of the family, and
attended by the best physicians. But how
Is it with the ignorant poor who live in ,
crowded cottages, whose attendants know
nbthlng of hygiene, and who wait too
long before eeekins the sersices of a
doctor, dreading the expense thereof.
These are the people whom it Is a delight
Ito help, and whom the hospital most
benefits. There is, however, a growing
Inclination on the part of well-to-do peo- !
pie to seek hospital treatment fur sur
gery and certain kinds of illness. This
makes it advisable to fit up one or two pri
vate rooms for such patients as wish to ;
occupy them. Patients of this kind may
and generally do provide their own pri
vate nurse, but in addition pay generously
and are a welcome source of income to a
hospital. It Is reckoned that 20 per cf>nt
Of tno expenditures are to be gained from
patients, for the hospital can be free only i
to those who are absolutely unable to pay. !
The remainder must be raised, and this is
Where the fpollng of public spirit blfntls
With the feeling of universal brotherhood,
and the hospital will come to bo supported
because the town Is proud of It.
"There Is one more point in favor of the
hospital In small townsâ lta benefit to
the physicians. Althoivgh their services ;
are free to the institutionâ except in tho
case of patients in private rooms, who |
are able to pay for treatmentâ they arÂ© I
helped by enlarged experience, and by as
soclatlon with the famous doctors who
1 from time to time are called from large
cities for an operation or a consulta
| tion."
COMPULSORY CREMATION.
Measure That Is Now Pending in the
British Parliament.
In England the idea of making crema- !
tion compulsory is being earnestly pressed
with a view of cheapening the cost of the i
disposal of dead bodies and upon the
higher ground of sanitation. A bill in
Parliament looking to this end has passed
the committee and the first reading, with
an amendment that causes It to apply
only to certain largo cities and to defined
conditions of society in them.
It is twenty-five years since the first
organization "was made In Great Britain
to establish a crematorium. It took six
years to get one built, and it was four
years before an incineration took place; |
but from the date of its lirst use, that Is j
to say. fifteen years ago, the number of
incinerations has Increased rapidly, so |
that several thousand bodies were cre
mated last year. Aside from the senti
mental phase of the matter, one of tho
most potent obstructions thrown in the
way of the society that promoted the
plans wns that cremation could be used I
to destroy the evidence of crime. This j
objection was met by the society assum- j
Ing the obligation to Investigate the con- ,
ditions of death In the case of every body)
for which application for incineration
should be mnde. Thr prejudices were
finally overcome, as may be seen by the
fact that the proposed legislation includes 'â 
a provision that in the whole kingdom
cremation should be obligatory in cases j
where death Is duo to transmissible dis
eases, as smallpox, scnrlet fever and
tuberculosis. The measure Is meeting no
considerable opposition, and the bill will
probably pass. This is meeting the ques- j
tlons involved in a wise and broad spirit.â ;

PRETTY WOMAN
Was Selling Chances on a Live
Chicken â A Parisian Game.
While I was sitting in Victor's I waa
made the victim of the most unique con
fidence game I encountered during my
journey. A tall woman In black camo In
at the front door and approached me, her
alding her Intentions by a winning smile.
(In Europe If any one smiles at you get
ready to spend money). This woman car
ried a live chicken in one hand, and In tho
other was a black cloth bag with a puck
ering string at the top. She paused in
front of me and exhibited the chicken, at
tho same time making some sort of appeal
to me in French.
I called to the waiter and asked him to
! translate the lady's remarks. She paid
' she was sluing "chances" on the chicken.
In the black bag were certain small en
velopes costing two BOUfl (.2 cents) each,
One of these envelopes contained the
ticket which won the fowl.
I told him that I was a stranger, merely
passing through town, and I didn't believe
that I could find any use for a live
chicken.
He suggested that I might take It back
to America with me as a souvenir of
Marseilles. I told him there was a high
duty on chickens. TJien he Bald that the
woman was poor and had to support two
children, ana her only way of making a
living was to raffle this same chicken for
a year or two. Also I noticed that the
fefcthers were worn off Its legs.
The waiter suggested that even if I took
a few chances there wouldn't be any great
danger of my winning the chicken. Ac
cepting this assurance, I bought three
tickets, all of which were blank. The
woman In black thanked me with much
cordiality and went her way. If she had
come to me and begged for six sous I
I would have despised her, but as the ln
! ventress of a new swindling game I shall
always hold her In the highest esteem.â

REPORT OF ATTEMPT TO BRIBE
ACCUSER'S HUSBAND.
Dramatic End of Sensational Trial of
the Aged Lothario Who Deceived
and Robbed Scores of
Women.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Aug. 19.
Arthur Arlington, the gay deceiver of
scores of unsuspecting women, was once
more convicted of grand larceny to-day
by a jury In Judg-e Hall's court. It took
but ten minutes for the jury to decide
that the story related by Mrs. M. M
Bmith, the prosecuting witness, charging
the aged Lothario with stealing her purse,
containing $214, at Blair Park on the after
noon of April 14 last, was gospel truth, and
Arlington's narrative of how he had spent
the night of the same day at the Rich
mond House in San Francisco with his
fair accuser was a base fabrication.
The case went to the jury- late In the
afternoon. But one ballot was taken, and
the announcement of the verdict did not
appear to 4' sconcert t -he aged Lothario
one whit. Sentence will be pronounced
come day next week, and in view of the
two priors he can not get less than ten
years, and the court may impose life sen
tence.
The case has been one of the most sen
pational of its kind ever tried in this coun
ty, and the most extreme care was taken
rron that might prove fatal on
t.
Deputy District Attorney George Sam

KERR SAVED
THE "OWL" FROM
BEING WRECKED
Tender Left Track at
Dos Palos.
A RECORD FOR STOPPING
THREE HOURS DELAY CAUSED
BY THE ACCIDENT.
Although Going Sixty Miles an
Hour the Train Was Stopped
300 Feet After the Wheels
Left the Track.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. UÂ».
Once again the "Owl" train has just
avoided a serious calamity. A little fright
among the passengers and a delay of
three hours is the sum total of the dam
ages. But had it not been for the coolnens
of the engineer inquests would have been
held in San Benito County to-day.
The derailing of the tender was the
cause of the accident. Engineer L. C.
Kerr, who is credited with being one cf
the coolest headed men on the Southern
Pacific, and one of the most nervy, was in
charge of the "Owl" when it left Fresno
yesterday morning for Oakland. Just
when the train reached the point where
nine days previously the Los Angeles ex
press had jumped the track and caused
the death of its engineer and tireman the
hoodoo appeared hovering over the "Owl."
The rear trucks of the tender jumped
the track for no apparent reason, and of
course the wreck ot the train was immi
nent. Engineer Kerr was instantly aware
of the fact that his tender â¢ had gone
wrong but neither he nor his fireman
dreamed of jumping to save himself. Kerr
at once set the airbrakes, reversed the
. i gine and stopped his train within a dis
tance of 300 feet, which is considered
marvelous in view of the fact that it was
then going not less than sixty miles an
hour. It is said to be unprecedented in
the history of California railroading that
an engine with six heavy cars going ai
such a speed with a derailed tender could
be stopped so speedily and with no dam
age being done.
Word of the accident was sent to Men
dota, where an engine was sent out, arid
,'is there is a long sidetrack near Dos
Palos there was but little delay, and tie
"Owl" rame Into the Oakland pier just
three hours kite. An inspection of the
track and of the derailed tender failed to
give any Indication as to what might have
caused the accident, and the authorities
are entirely In the dark about it.
Objected to Relatives' Presence.
OAKLAND. Aug. 10.â The deposition of
Jjine Hodge, who Is suing John Nichols,
the aged capitalist, for heavy damages on
sin alleged breach of promise to marry
her .was to have been taken to-day. At
torney George W. Reed, for plaintiff, wnn
pr< sent and asked that the relatives of
the witness be excluded from the room.
Attorneys McKee and Mhoon, on behalf
of the defendant, refused to allow this,
however, so Jane Hodge's deposition was
not taken after all. The matter will now
be taken to the Superior Court

LAUNDRY ORDINANCE
DECLARED INVALID
BERKELEY, Aug. 19.â 1n the case of
the People vs. Ah Foon, which came to a
conclusion this morning. Judge Edgar
handed down a decision holding the or
dinance passed by the Board of Trustees
last March prohibiting the erection of a
laundry house within 3uo feet of a resi
dence invalid.
The ordinance was passed upon the re
quest of several residents in view of the
many Chinese laundries which were being
erected in the residence portion of the
town. Property owners made use of the
measure recently to prevent the erection
of a Congregational Chinese mission wash
house in Dwight way.
Judge Edgar's decision now removes the
legal bar to the promiscuous building of
the kind of houses which it was the in
tention of the ordinance to prevent. The
property owners in question expect to car
ry their point by insisting upon a more
rigid observance of the municipal sanitary
regulations.

questions" of the day.
Mrs. Howard witnessed the meeting of
Queen Victoria and the American dele
gates, and she speaks of it as a queen
receiving many queens. She says our rep
resentative women were not in any way
overawed by either the ruler of Great
Britain or other members of royalty, and
as for herself Mrs. Howard says she was
more Impressed by Mrs. Shields of Sacra
mento County, who Is one of the leading
agriculturists of California, than she waa
by her Britannic Majesty.
Mrs. Howard disapproves very strongly
of the plan now being carried out of cut
ting down, for the decoration of San
Francisco when the California volunteers
shall return, hundreds of small trees. She
says this is waste and worse than waste,
and is directly opposed to those principles
which have assisted in the upbuilding of
Great Britain.
Lady Beach Cunard, who was formerly
Miss Maude Burke of this city, figures in
an amusing anecdote just sent from Lon
don. She was asked to meet the Prince
of Wales at a dinner given by a very
smart hostess. On the day of the dinner
she met the lady at whose house she was
to dine, and ta her consternation she was
told that she would be seated by the side
of the Prince of Wales. The Oakland girl
begged for another position, telling her
hostess that she would be too frightened,
too agitated, to do herself Justice. The
hostess would not be turned from her in
tention, and when all were seated she
introduced Lady Cunard to the Prince and
said: "Sir, next to you is Lady Cunard,
who begged me to nut her somewhere else
because she is afraid of you." Albert
Edward turned to the Oakland belle, who
was almost ready to sink under the table,
according to the London story, and
laughed heartily, making himself so
agreeable that the American upheld her
famr> of being one of the most charming
daughters from this country in English
society. Before the dinner was over his
Highness, the Prince of Wales, realized
that he was the intellectual Inferior of the
two.
THE ORDER FOR FLAGS
TO FLY AT HALF-MAST
Question to Be Finally Settled by the
City Council Next Monday
Night.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 19.
The stars and stripes is causing much
trouble at the City Hall. Yesterday, when
one of Oakland's most honored ex-Mayors
passed away, no flag could be found for
some time to hoist at half-mast, and
Mayor Snow adjusted the difficulty ter
n. porarily by hastening to a dry goods store
and borrowing a flag for the occasion.
When the Mayor came downtown he
was first led to inquire as to who was
dead by seeing the great flag on the lofty
Liberty pole at half-mast. On learning
who had passed away the Mayor inquired
who had given orders for the flag to be
lowered on the Liberty pole and also at
once ordered the flag hoisted over the City
Hall at half-mast, which he informed the
Police Department is the proper place for
showing respect to the memory of a de
parted citizen.
A few days ago the Council ordered the
Police Department to hoist the great flag
on the Liberty pole every fine day. It
has since been done, but yesterday, when
Officer Dave Swain and Jailer Phillips
performed the duty they learned of the
death of J. West Martin, and they only
hoisted it half way. Mayor Snow was not
pleased with this, and he has dtermined
that he will bring the matter before the
Council next Monday night, so that a
resolution can be passed making it im
possible for any further mistake and au
thorizing the Mayor to order public flags
at half-mast when he shall see fit.
The weakness of the old City Hall was
further demonstrated by the Incident, for
when the immense flag from the Liberty
pole had been brought over by the May
or's orders an attempt was made to hoist
lit over the City Hall. The strain on the
pole and on the ancient dome was too
much for the flag, even at half-mast, so
It was hauled down, and it was then that
the Mayor went Into a dry goods store
and borrowed a smaller flag until the
janitor could be found to procure the reg
ular City Hall flag.

BERKELEY, Aug. 19.â T. J. Murphy
who was arrested some time ago on a
charge of obtaining goods under false pre
tenses, has now the additional charge
against him of having skipped his bonds
men. Murphy was arrested on a com
plaint sworn to by Town Marshal Lloyd
He represented himself as traveling for a
tailoring firm and took a deposit from
Lloyd of $5 for a suit of clothes. The suit
was never delivered and Lloyd had a war
rant issued. Murphy found bondsmen in
Fred Wenker and Fred Ohe, both of Oak
land. On the date set for trial he failed
to appear and this morning Judge Edgar
declared his bail of $100 forfeited.
SALT WATER NOT
HARMFUL TO LAWNS
0 z^^v AKLAND, Aug. 19.â The plan to sprinkle the streets of this city with
â¢% (( \\ salt water has caused many to regard the scheme with some anxiety,
3. II II based upon the result to flowers and lawns. One of the prettiest parks
4* \z~-zy In Oakland Is Jefferson Square, one of the longest sides of which is on
4* Seventh street. For a generation the Southern Pacific Company has
jÂ£ sprinkled Seventh street every night with salt water. At times the crust of
jÂ£ the street has been almost â¢white with salt and there is less dust on the street
j. than on any other street in the city that is not made of bitumen or wooden
.j. blocks. If the result of salt water were detrimental to lawns. Councilman
A Glrard argued that It should be apparent by this time at Jefferson Park.
V[ William Goodwin is the gardener at this park and when asked about the
Q matter he said:
\ "Salt water appears to lay the dust In the roadway much better than does
(/ fresh water. The railroad has used salt water for years in keeping down the
A dust between its tracks. When heavy sprinkling is done the water finds its
V way to the gutters and there kills the weeds, but it has never injured my
n lawn. Its green blades are as fresh to-day as when I took charge. It Is all
, rot about thÂ« salted dust Injuring the lawns. The only persons to suffer
X damage through the use of salt water in street sprinkling are those who
X drive about in carriages. The salt I understand does affect the varnish on
I carriages, but carriages are not green lawns."

WILLING TO HEAR CITIZENS
COL. WALKER SAYS OAKLAND
IS NOT UP TO SPEED.
Evidently Not Aware of the Fact
That a Strong Effort Was Made
to Secure the Transconti
nental Terminus.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 19.
President Ripley of the Santa Fe is now
on the ccast and In an Interview to-day
he said that his company has no plans
matured yet that extend any further than
Point Kichmond. He said:
"We are now concerned with the com
pletion of the road to Point Richmond. I
am not prepared to say what the future
may develop, but we believe that the ttr
minal at Point Richmond is well suited
to our purpose and that we will be able
to accommodate our through business at
that point.
"I will say that I do not think our peo
ple have seriously considered the propo
sition at any time of carrying our main
traffic through Oakland.
"Of ccurse, Oakland is a nice place and
we may ultimately have closer connec
tions with it, but that is a matter to be
developed In the future. How that will
be accomplished I am not prepared to
say.
"So far as the ferry business is con
cerned, and I have had some experience
with the suburban travel, I don't see how
it can be BO vastly profitable at the rates
that the Southern Pacific Company is car
rying people with its expensive equip
ment. 1 am aware that it is possible to
so keep the books as to show that the fer
ry is making the profits instead of the
railroad.
"If any of the citizens or city officials
of Oakland desire to see me 1 shall be
in the city for several days and would
certainly be willing to meet them, but
as 1 have said before, I don't know that
1 cou!J say anything that would be of in
terest or advantage to them.
"We appreciate the interest of the peo
ple ol Oakland and their good will toward
the Santa i-'e, but we are not at present
able to say what our plans will be with
regard to any closer contact with that
city."
Colonel A. P. Walker, chairman of the
Santa Fe directory, has sized up the sit
uation in regard to Oakland.
"We have splendid terminal facilities at
Point Richmond and are expending a good
deal of money there," said the colonei.
"Point Richmond commands the Golden
Gate and the commerce of the Orient.
The bay is an open roadway. We don't
have to have any franchise on the water.
It strikes me that your people in Oakland
are a little slow in waking up to an ap
preciation of the situation. If you had
been alert you would have put forth your
efforts before the Valley road selected
Point Richmond for its terminus. It is
probable that you did not appreciate the
importance of the Valley road."
Colonel Walker is not aware that threu
years ago citizens of Oakland pledged
very generous support to me Valley road
if it came to Oakland. The road, how
ever, signified its intention to go to Point
Richmond and hinted that Oakland's ef
forts could accomplish nothing.

PRICKING POINTS
On the Foils Furnish a New Sensa-
tion in Fencing Bouts.
Habitues of the Paris fencing schools
are no longer satisfied with contests in
which the rapier's point Is rendered harm
less by a button. Recent differences of
opinion over the championship competi
tion and other public exhibitions have led
to several challenges in which the weap
ons have had short points projecting be
yond the button, and the competitors, in
stead of wearing pads, competed stripped
to the waist. The scratch made on the
skin by the point could leave no room for
discussion as to whether the fencer had
been touched or not. The most interest-
Ing of these matches was one between
M. Elie Dufraisse, prevot of the Baudry
School, and M. Marcel Boulenger, cham
pion of the Merignac Salle d'Armes. Each
of the adversaries had two seconds. M.
Thomegueux and M. Roge acting for M.
Dufraisse and Comte de Reverseaux and
M. Lusclez for M. Boulenger, exactly as
If a real duel were taking place. The
style of the two fencers was absolutely
different. M. Boulenger held his guard
low and attacked In slxte and seconde,
while his opponent, holding to the tactics
of the Baudry School, kept his point well
in line, evaded M. Boulenger's weapon
and riposted by rapid rtoubles. Victory
remained with M. Dufraisse, who scored
three hits to nothing. This meeting was,
it is generally acknowledged, necessary
on account of previous discussions. But
now M. Beau, a well-known amateur, has
issued a general challenge which has
been accepted by M. Georges Breittmeyer,
a celebrated left-handed fencer. Not
even masks are to be used in this en
counter. There are also others in view,
one that Is spoken of, for instance, being
between M. Elie' Dufraisse and M. Mau
rice Bernhardt, son of'TVlme. Sarah Bern
hardt. Many amateurs deprecate the in
troduction of this element of danger into
what was formerly a peaceful form of
sport, and it is doubtful if it will meet
with lasting success.â Paris Special to the

Results at Ingleside.
The young greyhounds which ran In the
puppy stake at Union Coursing Park yes
terday divided honors with the older dogs
in the open stake. The best the local ken
nels have were sent to the slips and
showed excellent sport. The bettors did
not have an accurate line on the young
sters, the result being a number of upsets.
R. E. de B. Lopez's Minneola defeated
D. J. Healey's O'Hara at odds of 1 to 7.
Justice defeated Julius Caesar at 1 to 5,
Sky Blue won from Go On at 1 to 2 and
Miss Penman defeated Aeneas at 2 to 5.
D. J. Healey's Grenada, by Rusty Gold-
Wave, Is a pronounced favorite for the
stake, having been played off the boards
In the long odds book. Mamie Pleasant,
Minneola, Forest Queen. Forest King and
J. J. Edmonds 1 Whisky Hill all have a fol
lowing.
The biggest upset in the open stake was
the defeat of Warship by Amarosa, the
latter at odds of 1 to 3. This was the
longest course of the day, the dogs run
ning one minute and thirty-four seconds.
In the Magic-Wild Lassie course the lat
ter led to the hare by many lengths. As
this was a decided reversal of form Judge
Bull did not declare a winner and all bets
were declared off. Handy & Smith, the
owners of Magic, were held blameless.
Their black dog had a four-minute course
at Ingleside last Sunday, and they did not
learn that he had not recovered until they
saw him run.
While Royal Flush was being taken to
the slips a hare was released for a brace
of dogs. Flush saw the hare, broke away
from his handler and killed. He had on
his heavy blanket, collar and strap. He
went out immediately and won his course.
Royal Flush is favorite for the stake,
with J. Dean's Gladiator next in demand.

ACTRESS GAIL
FORREST GRAVES
GETS A DIVORCE
Husband Deserted
Her Years Ago.
AND SHE WAS HIS SUPPORT
JOHN ANDERSON ALSO TELLS OF
HIS WIFE'S CRUELTY.
Because She Deserted Him for a
Theatrical Man He Can No
Longer Sleep and Has
Lost in Weight.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 19.
The matrimonial bonds that have exist
ed since IS9O between pretty Gail Forrest
Graves, the California actress, and Ed
ward F. Graves, formerly manager of tha
Casino In New York, were legally dis
solved by Judge Ogden this afternoon.
The decree was granted on the ground
of desertion, as alleged In the complaint,
which was filed several months ago. Ow
ing to the pendency of the divorce suit the
charming plaintiff found it inconvenient
to continue on her recent theatrical tour,
and hence she has been sojourning at the
home of her father, Henry Barroc, chair
man of the Central Republican Club of
Berkeley.
According to Mrs. Graves* complaint her
husband cruelly neglected her and de
serted her some time In 1894, and prior
thereto, she had been compelled practi
cally io support him out of her salaiy,
{ which at the time ranged between $50 and
I $75 per week. Graves is at present at the
head of a theatrical enterprise on tne
road, and has made no particular contest
against the divorce suit. Being finally
released by the decree granted in the Su
perior Court to-day, Mrs. Graves will
shortly resume her theatrical career.
Varying greatly In particulars, though
also based on the grounds of desertion
and cruelty, is the suit of John Ander
son, filed this afternoon, against Mary-
Alice Dorothea Anderson. This couple
also was married about ten years ago, out
by all accounts lived happily together un
til about three months ago, .when a young
thespian of San Francisco bestowed his
attentions upon Dorothea, and the domes
tic troubles that ensued wrecked the little
Anderson home in this city.
According to Mr. Anderson's complaint,
the wife, who is a pretty brunette, began
making too frequent visits to San Fran
cisco, and one day the determined John
located his deserting spouse in a French
restaurant feasting upon oysters and wine
and basking in the smiles of her young
j thespian lover, whose name Anderson has
not learned. Finally orte day Mrs. Ander
son packed up her trunk and left for good.
Now John Anderson complains that his
wife's actions have caused him mental
anguish, lacerated his fondest affections,
reduced him in weight because he can no
longer enjoy peaceful repose at nights,
and that his mind was almost wrecked by
such cruelty. Attorneys Gibson and Wool
ner represent the plaintiff husband, and.
j there is likely to be no contest save over
; the property of the parties, which is val
ued at several thousand dollars.

PLAY ER FOLK,
THROUGH THE
CRITIC'S EYE
Â£=-â qO-NIGHT~In "As You Like It".
â¢Blanche -Bates closes a successful
TO-NIGHT In "As You Like It"
Blanche Bates closes a successful
season at the California. The com
pany holds some very good mate
rial, but in selection of play they
nave gone beyond their depth,- and the
consequent sin of miscasting has been
often committed. Their greatest crime is
the production of Shakespeare's comedy.
Miss Bates' ambition to play Rosalind is
no legal excuse for such a venture. The
most crying need of the organization is
an artist hand to guide. In fact, organi
zation seems a sarcasm when applied.
Miss Bates, whose prominent characteris
tic is temperament, needs a strong man
agerial grip at the rein. Without this,
and the proper environment for develop
ment, she has reached the zenith of her
professional career. .Her next move lies
chiefly outside of herself. "A Bachelor's
Honeymoon" Is the bill for Monday night.
. The wild applause that greets the most
lurid happenings of "Under Two Flags"
proves the need we have for continuous
melodrama. There are those among us
whose emotions are best reached by the
explosion of an arsenal, and who recog
nize truth only In exaggeration. The pas
sengers whom Mr. Morosco cast adrift
are still In search of a hospitable shore,
who shall come to the rescue? This week
the Alcazar recovers its equilibrium in
Camllle" and "Romeo and Juliet." "In
gomar" Is In preparation.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Patriotism Is rampant. Let us hope it
Is not, like Lady Teazle's reputation, In
danger of dying from too much health.
Alexandra Dagmar, the Russian, seized
upon the stars and stripes in her songs
at the Orpheum last week and got enthu
siastically whistled to the front a half
dozen times in consequence. Gertrude
Mansfield and Caryl Wilber have latent
talent, but it Is not easily expressed
through the limp medium of "color blind."
If there is a man sitting out in the future
capable of writing good sketches, one
would like to reach out the vaudeville
arm and "nab" him. We of to-day are
quite us worthy as posterity. The Car
downie troupe are not favorites â just why
is unexplainable. â¢ The touch of the bar
baric In their dancing makes it thorough
ly artistic. Reversing Tolstoi, let me
conclude that what is art is not, of neces
sity. interesting. This week Hall and
Staley, twentieth century burglars, Freese
brothers and McMahon and King are the
new people.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"Dorothy and Bessie Faubaln" honestly
represents last week's attraction at the
Grand Opera House, for does not "and"
on the playbills indicate the star? If the
promise of variety Pricllla Prlvett
gives is kept In future roles she will put
Mr. Wolf upon his mettle. But why say
"if"? In one such clever performance she
can scarcely have marked her limitations.
Yon Suppe's "Clover" is the bill for this
week.
â¢ â¢ â¢ .
Clay Clement with a picked company
opens at thÂ« Columbia to-morrow night
in "A Southern Gentleman." In artistic
stage business Mr. Clement Is sometimes
likened to Richard Mansfield, so that the
role of General Carroll, a character study,
should be for him an excellent medium
for dramatic expression.

THE FAREWELL PERFORMANCE.
Filipino Acrobats Give Their Last
Exhibition.
The troupe nf Filipino acrobats gave Its
farewell performance at the Mechanics'
Pavilion last night before a fair sized
audience. The programme consisted of
juggling, pole balancing and all sorts of
acrobatic feats, some of which were quite
up to standard. The principal feature was
Bong, the Tod Sloan of the islands, with
his trained Filipino pony, Dandy, which
is not much larger than a rocking horse,
who did some very clever bareback riding
and hurdle jumping.
The clown act was of the old-time va
riety, but caused much laughter on ac
count of the English spoken by the par
ticipants. It can bo said of the acrobats
that they have with them a great top
mounter in the youth who is tossed from
shoulder to shoulder, doing back somer
saults In fine style. It Is the intention of
the troupe to go to Chicago to play an
engagement, after which it will visit the
Paris Exposition a? an attraction.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â The stock market was
strong and active to-day, after a brief period
of hesitation and reaction after the publica
tion of the hank statement, new buying orders
of conspicuous stocks lifting them to the top
lÂ»vel of the day. There was some getting an
dfr r. ver under this bidding of prices, and a
Jew wÂ»ak spots made the market rather irregu
lar nt the close. Yesterday's vigorous upward
movement attracted quite .1 lance volume of
buying orders to the commission houses, and
the tone of the market was thus strong from
the opening. Th* weekly reports of the various
trade and commercial agencies and the In
creasf-d carninrs of practically all the rail
roads reporting helped on the upward move
ment The organized buying In Louisville and
Tennessee Coal continued in evidence; and
Central Pacific was bid op. Southern Pacific,
In Fplte of large dealings, v. as held back by
profit-taking, and shows only a moderate net
gain in the day. Louisville rose an extra 2VÂ»
and Tennessee Coal shows a net gain of r ..\.
Takings of St. Paul were on a very large ale
I and were accompanied by rumors of an Inten
tion to declare an extra dividend on th<; stock.
Other stocks notably strong were Norfolk and
Western common and preferred, the common
Braining 1%. Pacific Coast common and second
preferred rose 2>i points each. Hocking Valley
prt-ferred, Atchlson preferred, American Cot
ton Oil. National Steel preferred, SteÂ«l and
Wire preferred and a few other stocks Fhow
gains of a point 01 over. On the other hand
Sugar, Brooklyn Trancit, the tobacco stocks
and some of the steel ami iron stocks were un
der from pressure, and li.isÃt-n were shown here
and there in th<; railroad stocks, which were
only lightly dealt in. The bank statement was
rather puzzling in that the deposit liabilities
were not increased by as much as tho cash
and loan Increai â  But the emallness of the
changes lelt little ground for anxiety. After a
momentary hesitation trader decided to take
tho optimistic view of the statement. Southern
Pacific collateral fours when Issued were taken
in large amounts with a gain of 1 , -r cent.
Speculative, sentiment has been in a good deal
01 a hurly-burly all the week. An Inspection of,
the price It discloses some very Wide move
ments of prices in contrary directions.
Industfiul stocks as a rule are lower, the ex
ception being in the tqbacco stocks, Some
very Ktrikinc gains are iwn In individual
railroad stocks, but the change* In the major
ity of those stocks were surprisingly small un
til to-day considering the activity of the mar
ket and the furious speculative contest which
has been wased from time to time. So far us
an effort to cause a general reaction In prices
is considered the bears have suffered a total
rout and have shown symptoms of exhaustion
and a dl?')ositlon to cover short contracts, as
the week promised. a marked sentimental
effect was produced early in the week by a pub
lished announcement from a stock operator
noted for his boldness and many successes thai
he persisted In his belief that prices were too
hiKh :unl certain to cÂ» lower. This announce
ment induced a considerable following among
the board room traders, who have constituted
the greater part of the market for some time
past, and the buoyancy of a few stocks on
Monday, following the favorable bank state
ment of Saturday, did not awaken any general
demand for securities. There was a watchful
anticipation of a l>eiir raid, which came on
Tuesday with a fierce onslaught upon Brooklyn
Transit and American Steel and Wire. On
Wednesday the battle â¢ was continued and
shifted to SuKar. Turn â  Coal and th.-> to
baco stocks, when signs of realizing sales, after
the large gain in those stocks, made them vul
nerable. Only slight effect was produced on
thf standard railroad stocks, nnd individual
stocks in that deuartment continued to show
fctrikin? rains. Quite a number of obscure
stocks were brought forward and the price ran
2l> . i-iiy on special favorable conditions of
%b.o property. Pool operations also came into
evidence. The organized buying of Southern
and Central Pacific and Louisville an.i Nash
ville were particularly notable. As there are
heavy holding* of these properties in foreign
hands the stock became scarce for delivery and
the rise was thus aided. The pressure from
bear sources was largely 114 red as mi-- week
progressed. Late In the week the market
broadened quite materially and began
to -show signs of an outside interest being at
tracted by the leadership of the organiÃed pools
Which had set about billing; stocks. Call money
hniÂ« eased an additional fraction In New York
under continued offering's from outside domes
tic centers. Increased confidence In the money
â -unnk has been the prime Incentive in the ad
vance- In stocks. -â :-'â¢â¢:.:â --
Bonds have been less active relatively than
stocks and price movements have been Irregu- j
lar. The speculative Issues generally are higher. I

Associated Banks' Statement.
4 : â $>
The Financier says: The feature of the New
York bank statement for the current week was
an expansion of J1.045.600 In loans, the first
that has been recorder] sin^.- July S last. The
liquidation in this item In the Intervening
period has been no less than $47,000,000. The
loss in deposits in the same time has been
about $50.000.0 00. but the banks have $10,001,000
more surplus reserve than reported early In
July. Their position is correspondingly strong
er. " but the fact that loans are rising indi
cates that this steady liquidation is at an end.
The loan expansion, in view of the activity, Is
moderate to say the least. The banks gained
$1,000,000 as a result of the week's operations,
and as the Increase of $1,252,500 In deposits
called for an increase of leas than a third of
1 a million, in additional reserve requirements,
I there was an addition of 1686.976 to surplus,
I making the excess at the close of the week
$15.052.30. This Is k'SB than half the amount
I held at this season in ordinary years, but
! nothing approaching the present condition of
affairs, bo far as the widf distribution of
money is concerned has ever been known In
this country, and it is reasonable to Fiippose
that the drain on New York this fall will, be
correspondingly less. It Is reported, for in
stance, that the banks of Kansas are carrying
two-thirds up much surplus reserve as the total
held by the New York banks, and the interior
States are quite as well off. But while the
hanks here have managed to expend their sur
plus to a respectable figure. It Is not to be
i inferred that the rates for funds will. nlnk to
1 a lower level than at present. <'n the oon-
I trary the money market Is expected to main
tain rather a firm level over the opening of
1 September. After the crops have been moved,
however. It will be surprising If there is not
a relaxation in loan quotations, but before
this oc-iirs, the heavy export movement in
the way of cereals and cotton may influence
exchange rates to a point where gold Imports
will follow. It is an Interesting commentary
that the circulation of the New York banks
' Is beginning to expand once more after the
; greatest need for relief ha-3 passed. This has
'â¢â  always been ttw case In former periods of
I stringency.

Chicago Grain Market.
$ â  __ _ â¦
CHICAGO, Aug. 19.â Wheat opened strong at
an improvement of %c over yesterday's latest
prices. The advance had substantial backing.
Foreign markets showed sharp advances, Liv
erpool being up %'S%d and London 1 / 4 l Ssid.
Advices In regard to the Russian and Rou
manian crops were gloomy and probably had
considerable to do w4lh the advances at Liver
pool and London. Domestic news was even
more bullish in its tone than the foreign ad
vices. Heavy and continued rains were re
ported all over the. Northwest wheat fields and
many complaints of damage on that score were
received. The strength shown by corn was also
notable enough to affect shorts In wheat. Dur
ing the first- hour of the short sessions trading
on the market was quite active.' September
opened at "72'4'i?72%c. nnd even at that price
there was not much wheat offered. Shorts were
active bidders for everything offered and the
price got to 73%tfT73Hc berore realizing was suf- i
ficient to satisfy the demand. A short reaction :
to 72ViC followed, but the market quickly re- I
covered and in the space of the next half hour \
touched 72% c. The market then quieted down
somewhat. There was a good deal of selling
against weekly calls during the latter part of
the session and one or two slight reactions re
sulted therefrom, but the market had too mnch
substantial support to admit of a material de
cline and shortly before the â¢ close 72% c was
Again touched. A decrease of about a million
bushels In the visible supply was looked for
Monday. September reacted to 724.C and closed
firm at that price.
Trading in corn was marked by great activ
ity and . indenpendent strength. Continued
small receipts nml heavy shipments and de
crease in stocks alarmed the short interest In
September nnd resulted In a rush for cover,
which advanced that option lV&c on the day.
Deferred futures advanced a little In gym
pathy.
Oaf? were firm with corn. September closed

WHEATâ The week closed^ on a firm and
hardening market, with an increasing demand
on shipping account and a rise In futures.
The. Improvement seems to be general
throughout the world. Chicago was firmer on
account of better foreign advices and a good
1 shipping and speculative demand. Cables were
' ltd higher, principally owing to bullish re
ports from London regarding the Russian croo.
i In this country, too. the outlook Is less fa
vorable, heavy rains in the Northwest doing
some' damage. The exports for the week
were 4,000,000 bushels.

OATSâ The demand continues slack at pre
vious quotations. The circular of George Mor
row & Co. says:
"Receipts for the week, 17. 05S centals, of
which- California contributed almost the entire
amount. The market is in a very unsettled and
unsatisfactory condition. Everybody Is antici
pating lower prices when the northern emp
begins to move, and. Judging by the fears of
' some people, one might think a great oat
i glacier were slowly working this way. It Is
more than probable the result will not be bo
bad as some people think.
â¢'What will happen to Red Oats when the
new Oregoas come to market Is quite a ques-
I tion. White Oats have been so scarce that, for
the first time In years. Red Oats have been
1 very generally used, and; like Red Oat hay,
'â  have proved themselves excellent feed. The
question 13 will they drop very much when
White Oats become plentiful? We think not.
I They are Just as good feed as the White Oata
! and consumers -have become accustomed to
their color. Red Oats have come to stay."

Jacob Wollner's circular says:
"Our wool market Is rather quiet, as the
scouring mills are cleaning up, and Eastern
commission brokers cannot get any orders for
scoured wool at prices at which wools can be
made now.
"As usual, the first few lambs' wools that
came in brought high prices and raised the
views of growers on their fall wools. The
outlook is good for a firm, steady market, but
extremely high prices cannot be realized as
yet. Wools have been higher In the West than
in the Eastern seaboard markets and will Bavt
to rise materially in the East to meet the
Western men's views.
"It Is not surprising that there is a lull In
the market when we take Into consideration
that since the Ist of April over 40,000.000 pounds
of wool have been shipped from this market
alone. The woolen goods market Is firm and
advancing and clothiers are amazed at the ad
vance In goodÃ, especially as people now want
a better class of goods than they formerly
used. The spring wools are nearly all mar
keted and the warehouses are pretty well
cleaned up."

The Moonshiner's Woe.
Atlanta Constitution.
"This here guvfrnm.'iit. wants the
earth," said the old moonshiner. "The
revenue men caught me in the act an'
hauled me up before the jedge. The jedge
looked like a reasonable man, an' I told
him that I only run a 'still' to buy shoes
for my family. That's whar I made a
break, for he says right off, says he:
'Well, I'm goin' to give you a chance to
make shoes for the guvernment. an' I'll
see to It that yer family gils a pair o' 'em
every six months.' Then he sent me up
for two years."

pood? by Naud and .ludÃmr-nt went to
Stewart ' from which defendant appealed.
She showed that notice of delinquency and
sale wan duly made in a daily n.-wsnaper
and by notices posted on the warehouse
and in the office of an auctioneer. The
case was lost to the defendant because
t er warehouse foreman had failed to take
note of tbe address of Stewart, although
it waa offered, and hence Stewart was
never directly notified of the threatened
sale. Tb< upper court affirms the judg
ment of the lower court by Baying that
the negligence of the foreman In not not
ing Stewart's address aa requested was
the negligence of the defendant.

TWO JURORS FINED
Penalty Imposed for Disobeying
Summons of the Court.
In future H. C. Hager, 400 Turk street,
and Morris Raphael, 1274 O'Farrell street,
will answer summons to appear and qual
ify as jurors. They were summoned to
appear Thursday before Judge Cook, but
failed to obey the order. An attachment
was issued by Judge Cook and placed In
the hands of Deputy Sheriff Dasha. Yes
terday morning they were brought Into
court. Hager said that his wife fell down
and injured herself, and in the excitement
he forgot all about the summons. Raphael
said that he had the rheumatism and in
consequence disobeyed the summons. Ho
admitted, however, that his illness had
not kept him from his office. Judge Cook
then gave the talesmen his idea of their
duty and fined each the sum of $25. Both
were immediately repentant, but the court
was obdurate and the judgment stood.
Deserted His Wife.
Lizzie Nixon filed suit yesterday against
her husband, Thomas C. Nixon, for mnln
tenance. Mrs. Nixon alleges that her hus
band deserted her on the 12th inst., leav

Seven years ago Jason Brown came
to Southern California, For a twelve-'
pxouih the balmy climate. prolonged hJs
/^Z*&^ *-â ; â
wife's life; then phe passed Into the
great beyond. Jason Brown did not
care to return to their home in Ohio In
tertwined with memories that would
stab his loneliness. He wrote to a Mr.
Fanning, who owned land In the Santa
Cruz Mountains, and three weeks after
ward Jason Brown stood on hlrs twenty
aorta of mountain land, monarch of a
superb view that stretched as far as
Monterey Bay.
.Wealth had fled with youth, RWI Ja
son Brown had not the $25 ptr acre, the
exorbitant sum which he agreed to give
for the land. He paid down his little
all, and then/set about to earn the re
mainder. That was six years 'ago, and
Jason Brown is still a great many dol
lars and cent? from paying the debt.
To clear off his two acres has been a
long and weary task without financial
return. Throe miles below Jason
Brown lives Mr. Fanning, who is hav
ing a road built from Farming's -to Ben
Lomond. Mr. Fanning employs Jason
Brown on this road, giving him a dol
lar and a quarter] to hi;; credit for every
day that ho works. If he keeps his
health and lives long enough he hopes
to thus work off the debt for h!s land.
Jason Brown requires a small month
ly pum of money, so he can not devote
â¢â¢very day to the road-building. He
must needs work for the other neigh
bors who pay him cash. For his per
sonal wants a few cents suffice. Be
sides the vegetables from his own gar
den, tea, coffee, flour, beans and mush
make up his list of necessary pro
visions. But at an institution In Ohio
is the little blind girl to whom he sends
the few dollars that he can earn.
He carries her photograph next to
his heart and she is as der.r to him as
though she were his own flesh and
blood. The little tot, with the glint of
gold in her hair and the music of child
hood honey sweet on her lips, with
dark lashes fringing soft blind blue
eyes, walked straight into his heart on<Â»
summer's day. She is on the verge of
her teens now, happy in a God-given
gift that makes her forget the sightless
Blind little Alice has a bird-like voice
of such wonderful timbre that all who
have heard her sing predict a career
for her. In a few years, if her voice
makes good Its promise, this blind girl
will sing herself into the great heart of
the music-loving world.
This is Jascrn Brown's dearest wish.
It is for this that he tn^g to earn Uni
wherewithal that his adopted daughter
may have the very best musical ad
vantages. If he can make his twenty
acres valuable enough to pay for this
he will die happy.
Mr. Brown does not care to discuss
aerial navigation, fearful of being call
ed a "crank." He showed a letter of
his father's written in the early '50's to
an American scientist. John Brown in
formed his friend that his son Jason
was of an inventive turn of mind and
that he was experimenting with a ship
that was to sail the air.
Jason Brown is still experimenting
on an air ship; though that letter of
John Brown's was written almost half
a century ago. The model for his air
ship was the one" thing his visitors
could not see. He has made a life-time
study of the movements of birds and
has worked along their lino. Mr. Brown
makes no foolish claims about his air
ship. He classes himself simply as one
of the searchers in the dark.
Seventy-six years have slightly
dimmed Jason Brown's eyesight, but
they have not clouded his brain. A
youth who next year gets his sheep
skin from the college of chemistry of
the University of California found, that
he had to put his best scientific foot
forward to keep pace with Jason
Brown.
Although his mode of living is rough
his manner of speech is the straight
forward one of the gentlemen of his
generation. Brought up on the border
line, he has the hospitality of the South
end the stern will of the North. His
family took an active part in the border
warfare waged between Kansas and
Missouri. One of his brothers was
atrociously murdered in the first of the
scrimmages and another driven Insane
by cruel treatment when taken pris
oner.

John Brown's body lies a-molJerinjr in thÂ»

Ills soul goes marching on.
Jason Brown was not with his father
at Harpers Ferry. He had not yet re-'
covered from a wound received In- an
other scrimmage. The Browns were
out-and-out abolitionists. They boldly
declared their anti-slavery convictions,
which meant that they had to be con
stantly on the defensive. ';:â *';.*
One night a squad of "border ruf
fians" came upon Jason Brown and a
companion. He was recognized as a
friend of the slaves and fired upon.
Ills companion escaped into the woods,
but Jason, slightly wounded, was cap
tured.
Among the "border ruffians," as the
invaders were called, were hot-headed
Southerners of birth and breeding.
They bound his wounds and, pale and
weak from loss of blood, stood him up
for a mock trial. To declare himself
an abolitionist meant certain death.
Yet without faltering Jason Brown de
clared that he believed God* hated slav
ery and that as long as he had breath
in his body he would help destroy It.
. A rope! a rope! they cried in hoarse
verdict. The knot was tied and a mo

over. Then the furious beating of
hoofs and a breathless messenger

Jason's companion had taken word to
John Brown of his son's capture. John
Brown recognized in the description of
the leador a young Kentuckian to
whom he had been of great service and
who owed him a debt of gratitude. Tho
messenger arrived just in time to allow
the Kentuckian to save John Brown*
Bon from hanging.
But the score was never chalked up
even between them. Three years later
through the dead and the dying a sol
dier in blue carried on his back an of
ficer in Confederate gray. Through the
battlefield that ran red with blood he
bore him, and across the thicket to a
hut, where he nursed him back to life.
The Union soldier was Jason Brown.
The Confederate officer was the Ken
tuckian. . â 
The stings of his many sorrows have
not .come home to live In Jason Brown's
heart, nor has the milk of kindness
curdled. He is strong in hope and faith
and full of the pride befitting the son of
John Brown.
The college student raffled one of
John Brown's revolvers at Loch Lo
mond. It netted fifteen dollars, which
he straightway carried to him. More
over, his story, told for the first time,
moved the hearts of hotel guests, and
about twenty -of them immediately
banded together, each agreeing to give
25 cents a month. The secretary is go
ing to send that and as much more
money as he can collect to Jason Brown
every month. He cannot refuse it for
he will not know whence it comes.
\ Jason Brown thinks he will be able
to pay off the three . hundred dollars
still due on his land. He often carries
sixty pounds on his back the three
miles from Loch Lomond to his cabin,
his faithful dog leading the way up the
steep trail. His is a wonderful strength
for 76 years..
But his neighbors shake their heads
and predict that It will not last long
enough for him to work off the debt
at a dollar and a quarter a day. If

In the West is a living son

rHE CALL'S Washing'- on correspondent recently asked
Cardinal Gibbons, at Baltimore, who was likely to sue-
deed the Pope in the e-<ent of the demise of his Holi
ness. "Ah," replied he, "out of fifty-eight Cardinals who are
eligible it would be hard to sax. But I think he will certainly
be an Italian, as they hai>c nearly a majority of all the Car
dinals who will be members of the sacred college."
The correspondent has learned through private letters from
Rome, however, that Pope Leo's successor will in all probability
be one of the following six, viz.: Oreglia, Parocchi, Vannu
telli f Seratino) , Gotti, Svampa or Rampolla, and their chances
are in the- order named.
To be considered "papabile" (eligible for Pope) it is suffi
cient that a Cardinal be a prominent man in the sacred college.
It is well known that Saint Peter was the first Pope. He was
appointed by our Lord. It is not absolutely essential thai the Pope
be selected from the list of Cardinals. Any Catholic prelate
might be chosen, but there has been no dc\ iation from the rule
of choosing a Cardinal as Pope, and -chile there are fiftx-cight
who arc eligible, still it is almost certain that the Pope will be

Luigi Oreglia di Santo Stcfaho is -72 years of age. He is a Piedmontese by
birth. li: double quality of senior Of the Sacred College- and Cardinal Camer
ltnga gives him a considerable advantage. During an "interregnum." the Camer
lenga is a species of interim Pope, who can revolutionize the pontifical court', ap
point, displace, substitute or revoke the highest officials. In other words, he is the
most to be feared of all the Sacred College, and by the hope or fear of the good or
harm he is capable of doing during his ephemeral pontificate he can create in ad
vance ;i network of adherents and friendships capable of exercising great weight

Pope or a fighting Pope, according to his personal inclination and. to the character
of the majority which placed him in St. Peter's chair, it is said that Leo' XIII
has often jestingly spoken of him as "my successor," which tends to show that
there is some consistency in his candidature. â¢ ' ; â 
.QaydfnaT â¢ .
Why should Cardinal Domenico Svampa,. Archbishop of Bologna, figure in the
list of "Papabile" in preference to so many other members- of- the' Sacred" College
whose' merits are equal and even superior .to his? No one can say., unless this
favor is due to the strange circumstance that he is. one of -the three Cardinals
now in charge whose arms correspond, to the prophecy of :-Malachy.-. You are
aware that the Abbe Malachy. who died in the odor of sanctity, left a series
of prophecies relating to the different Popes who might be elected after his death.
Chance has so willed it that hitherto his predictions have been justified by events.
. It is true that they were. couched in mottoes the terms of which were sufficiently
vague, and that a variety of interpretations could be placed, on them.. The motto
of the Pope who was to rucceed-Pius IX was "lumen de coelo." It - happened
that Leo XIII had In his escutcheon, beside a cypress, a star on a field .azure
According to the prophet Malachy the motto of the next Pope is "Ignis-Ardens '.'
The Sacred College at present contains three Cardinals whose arms could
Justify this predictionâ Cardinal Oreglia, whose shield bears an altar on which
burns the sacred fire; Cardinal Gotti, whose arms bear - a .torch, and Cardinal
Svampa', whose escutcheon is ornamented with a dog holding a torch in its mouth
Moreover, Cardinal Svampa might Tie indicated twice over in the prophecies
of Malachy, because his name in .Italian is almost synonymous with flame
If the annals of the Vatican are consulted from the tim? of Si Peter to tha
present day it will be seen that- the reigns of Pius IX and Leo XIII have been
very long : in comparison with those of the greater number of their 'colleague â¢ if
â¢ Cardinal Svampa should bo elected at the next conclave, arid if he should live as
long as Leo XIII his pontificate would last thirty-eight years. This would mean
that no Cardinal now living could ever aspire to the purple. This is asking too
much from human nature. â  â¢
Cardinal Svampa is also credited with leanings in the direction of a reconcili
ation with the Quirinal. a fact which explains the zeal with which a number of
Italian journals try to force his. candidacy to the front. They quote words which
â¢he is said- to have addressed to those who make allusion to the possibility of his
election: "I feel that I should be unworthy of it: but it" God should impose this
burden on me a great many changes will be seen." â¢ This it will be noticed is a.
Delphic utterance, which does not in any way We his hands', but which has' suf
â¢ ficed for Cardinal Svampa to be regarded as -a "Pope of conciliation." ..
CaÂ«RriaT RarppoTTa..
Cardinal Mariano Rampolla del Ttndaro is one of the niost curious figures In
â¢ the pleiades of "Papabile." The nobility of his character renders him disdain
ful of the little tricks by which me of his rivals Hatter- themselves thai they
dissimulate their ambition. .He avows it with the 5- frankness of a "grand
seigneur" who is of opinion that It is not a position beyond his merits. He would
add, without false modesty, ti.e device of Fouquet to thi of his family. Thus
everybody knows thai he is .working with assiduity In view of the next conclave
and that he neglects nothing thai can further his views.
For- ten years past he has been like a spider in the center of his web work
ing continually and spinning one. after another the threads of an intrigue' which
will only have its "denouement" after the death.of Loo XIII. and of which â¢',â
attendant." he weaves the meshes with infinite, art and cunnli
-. Has he many supporters? I flo not know how many; but 1 do know thir th y
are very devoted .a him. He Is one of those men who must either be loved or
hated. His proud, and haughty character will not allow him to tack armm*
reefs, to shun obstacles, to seek the friendship of those ho despises or the Â«vm.
. pathies of those who are not of His way. Of thinking. Instead of conci iat . ,; Vn.l
flattering his enemies. he breaks ; ,â lll. and when these adversaries -ire of thÂ«
stature of Ledochoskl and. of Oreglia, ho stiffens himself and disDlavs heforÂ«

at the Vatican and its surroundings a large number of personals' who â¢ .- â¢',â¢;Â»

The royal houses of the world are only

The Bourbons of France, and the Haps

It brings us back to when the world was
pagan and the smoke of the sacrifice
ascended from the pagan altars of Greece
and Rome. In the reign of Pope St. Syl
vester the Empress Helena, mother of
Constantine, placed at the Pope's dis

in which she built a chapel for ihe Sov

called St. John Lateran. ' It exists to
the present day. and is called the
mother- of all churches. The inscription
over the present edifice built on that very
spot is Mater Omnium Ecclesiarum
(the mother of all churches).- The first
fifty-six Popes wore canonized, saints and
the first twenty-nine Popes gave up their
lives in testimony of the faith and were

The elections begin at least ten days
after the Pontiff's death. If the foreign

through sickness or old age or other in
disposition, the election proceeds, and the
College of Cardinals cannot wait any
longer. Should any Cardinal arrive after
the ten days have elapsed he hag a right

takes place In Rome it takes place either
at the Quirinal or at the Vatican palace.
The fact that the Quirinal is now in the
hands of the Government and the resi
dence of the present King will preclude
the next election being held at the Quir
inal. Pope Plus IX. was elected at the
Quirinal, while Pope Leo XIII was elect
Â«â ! at the Vatican. Should the Pope die in
any other city than Rome â  the election
can take place in that city. As Pope Leo
has remained at the Vatican as a prisoner
since his election, the Vatican will in all
probability be the pla c of the next elec

rooms, called cells, one for himself and
one for his secretary. During these days,
and up to this time, the usual everyday
â¢official business of the Cardinals' lives
goes on. Ministers and Embassadors
come to transact business with the vari
ous Cardinals. They stand before them
with uncovered head and in the same
manner as before the Pope himself, since
the Cardinals have now assumed supreme
power In the church. Only one Cardinal
responds to the questions asked by the
representatives of the various Govern
ments, namely, the dean of the Sacred

clave, and they go In procession to the
place where the conclave Is to meet. The
papa] choir, consisting of the best
male voices ir. - Rome, is In attend
ance, and they sing the "Venl Cre
ator." When' the Cardinals assemble
in the chapel the bulls are once again
road, and. again they take the oath
to conscientiously observe the canons reg
ulating the election.' An address is deliv
ered by the Cardinal dean as an exhorta
tion to do their duty conscientiously. Up
to this time the Cardinals are in commu
nication with the outside world. They re
ceive visitors, transact business, etc., but
at the stroke of the midnight bell the
master of ceremonies rings a silver bell,
and all who are not of the conclave re
tire... The doors are finally and solemnly
closed, and no one is allowed to pass in
or out except the Cardinals' who per
chance may bo late in coming from for
eign countries. Each Cardinal is allowed
to have two members of his household in
personal attendance upon him. These are
called conclavists. A number of other at
tendants are also allowed inside the con
clave, viz., a carpenter, a mason, a sac
ristan, a friar or monk to hear confes
sions, a number of barbers, eight or ten
porters and several other domestics to do
common service to the whole body of Car
dinals.
The word "conclave" comes from the
fact of closing the door with a key.
"Clavis" in Latin means a key. The word
conclave refers to the inclosure as well
as to the body of Cardinals In session.

|n their selection of a successor to St.
IN ;er. This assembly of Cardinals is the
most august assembly in the world, and
is the only assembly that is known by
the word conclave. In the veins of these
Cardinals flows the purest and richest and
noblest blood T>n earth. They are the. sons
of the old Romans, descended from the
conquerors of the. world, heirs of the Sen
ators of old Rome who made and unmade
nations. The cells in which the Cardinals
nrÂ»> to dwell during elections are twenty
feet square and twenty feet high. The
cells of the Cardinals who have been
elected to office by the late Pope are
decorated with violet tapestry, while the
cells of the older Cardinals are covered
with green or red. The cell is divided into
two compartments, one for the Cardinal
and the other for his secretary. A Car
dinal of princely rank may have threÂ«
cells and two secretaries for personal at
tendants. When all are assembled within
the windows and all entrances to the con-
clave are closed. There Is only one door
to the conclave, and this Is locked with
a double key, one on the outside and one
on the inside. The governor, who is a
Cardinal appointed by the Sacred Col
lege, holds one key on the inside and the
marshal, who is a lay official, on the out
side, is the custodian of the other key.
There are four apertures In tho walls,
called gates, through which all their
men Is are passed and anything else that
is absolutely required. All this is to
avoid any communication with the outer
world and to prevent fraud or political
influence being used on the Cardinals in
the castine of their votes. Tlia outside
halls are also locked and the Cardinal
Camerllngo keeps these keys. Papal
troops are drawn up in attendance and
are in charge of one of the princes of the
house of Chigi, who also takes charge of
some of the outer keys and guards the
conclave from violence.
The most extraordinary precautions are
taken to shut out intrigues and political
influence. Each of the European nations
naturally takes an interest in the election
and zealously tries to have the election
turn out to its own interest. Al! these
precautions are necessary to withstand
any pressure that might be brought to
bear on the conclave and to allow the
Cardinals to vote for him who seems best
fit before God to spiritually govern 250,
--000.000 of people. The whole building Is
searched to see there is no one there ex
cept those who have a right to be, and this
search takes place twice every day. Even
the food is searched for secret documents
to see that it contains no letters or ad
vices or matters prejudicial to the con
scientious and just election of tho Pontiff.
Any man in the Catholic church is eli
gible to the office of Pope, be he Cardinal
or Bishop, priest or layman, married or
s-tngle. The Cardinals are free in this
matter, but from the time of Urban VI
the custom has prevailed of electing a
Cardinal, and an Italian Cardinal at that.
In these United States the law obtains
that he who is elected to the Presidency
must be born in the States, but the Cath
olic church is still more democratic, for
any man who is a Catholic Is eligible to
the Papacy. Only a pagan, a heretic or
an excommunicated person 1s excluded
from election. Should a married man be
elected he would have to separate, like
Peter of old, from his wife and receive
holy orders and episcopal consecration

at the hands of the Bishop of Ostia; so
that any man in the Catholic church may
be a candidate for Pope. Nowadays an
Italian Cardinal is usually elected because
of the great Interests of the church in the
city of Rome. The immense property and
wealth that has been accumulating for
nineteen centuries in Rome seems to de
mand It. One visit to Rome will easily
convince that great interests are at stake
and that Rome is the only place for the
Pope's residence, being the center of cult
ure, refinement and civilization. Naturally
an Italian Pope prefers his own country
and the city of Rome as his residence.
For an Italian turns to Rome as naturally
as the magnet turns to the pole. Even
the Italians of this, country long for the
deep blue Italian sky and the balmy cli
mate of Italy, which is the most salubrl
ousand enchantingcHmateof any on earth.
Again, history tells us that the French
men who were elected to the papal chair
returned to France, built magnificent pal
aces and dwelt there, conducting the
business of the church from the city of
Avignon. But to-day these palaces are
empty and of no value to the church since
Pope Gregory returned to Rome from
Avignon at the persuasion of St. Cather
ine of Sienna. The Pope has remained In
Rome ever since.
The voting in the conclave takes place
in the chapel twice a day, morning and
evening. Each Cardinal has a desk decor
ated with his coat of arms assigned to
him. Immediately before the election be
gins an Augustinian monk celebrates
mass. When the mass is concluded all the
attendants withdraw, leaving the Cardi
nals severely alone. They then prepare
to cast their first ballot. Two-thirds of
the votes must be given by ballot to val
idlyelect. WhentheCardlnals cannot agree
they can select two Cardinals and leave
the election of the Pope to them. This is
called an election by compromise, and
when all without delay proclaim a certain
one for Pope, as if by inspiration, this is
called an election by quasi-inspiration.
Leo XIII was elected in this way. His
election was due to Cardinal Antonelli.
While they could not. agree on a two-third
ballot. Cardinal Antonelli, seeing that
Cardinal Pecchi was gaining in favor at
each ballot, went over to him, knelt down
and kissed his hand and saluted him as
the Holy Father. The other Cardinals
took in the situation and with one acclaim
One of the Chambers Prepared for the Cardinals.
proclaimed him Pope. Thus Leo XIIT
owes his election to quasl-lnspiration.
When the ballots are counted and no one
has received a two-thirds vote the voting
papera are taken to a fireplace and
burned. The/ smoke ascending through a
certain chimney is a sign to an Immense
concourse of people assembled outside for
news of the election and to obtain the
new Holy Father's blessing, that the Car
dinals have not yet decided on any one
for Pope. When they see the smoke they
return to their homes, to come again in
the evening or the morning, as the case
may be. Then the Cardinals retire to
their apartments to await the next ballot.
This Is repeated each day till a Pope
is elected. Before' the voting takes
place a number of committees of Cardi-
nals are chosen to inspect the vote's, to
revise the election and to certify to Its
legality and regularity.
The ballots are printed on paper, and
each Cardinal writes the name of his
choice for Pope on the inside of the paper,
folds it, seals It with his own seal, made
for him and supplied for the occasion. An
altar is erected at the end of the chapel
and a large gold chalice and paten are
placed thereon. The inspectors of election
take their place at the altar. The Car
dinal Bishop of Ostia Is the first to rise.
He writes his name on his ballot in pub
lic at the center of the table, and ap
proaching the altar kneels, prays and ris
ing says. "I take Christ our Lord to wit
ness that I vote for the one whom in the
sight of God I deem worthy, and I will do
the same- in case the accesus is used." He
then places the sealed ballot on the paten
and allows It to fall into the chalice. The
Cardinals now approach in order of rank
and vote after the same manner. The sick
Cardinals send their votes through the
committee appointed. The first Cardinal
inspector covers the chalice with the paten
and shakes it. The third Cardinal in
spector counts the ballots and sees that
they agree with the number of Cardinals
present. If there Is any discrepancy the
ballots are burned and they begin the
election anew. Three inspectors then read
the names of each candidate aloud, so
that each name be heard by all. Each
Cardinal writes the name so read at" his
own desk and keeps an account of the
votes cast for each candidate. The ballots
are then returned once again to the chal
ice. If two-thirds of the vote are given
to any one person he becomes elected but
if the two-thirds are not given to any one
and they cannot agree on any candidate
they retire again to consider another can
didate for the next election. When two
thirds of the ballots are given to any one
person he is declared Pope and the con
clave is over. The youngest Cardinal then
rings a bell, calls all the Cardinals
around thÂ« newly elected. The Cardinal
dean aÃks him if he accepts the canonical
election to the supreme- pontificate; if h.>
says ha accepts, forthwith he becomes
Pope, head of the church. Bishop of
Rome, Father of Christendom, Vicar of
Christ and Sovereign Pontiff. Should he
refuse, the chair is still vacant and an
other election is in order. Should ho hesi
tate, he is asked threeVtlmes. On his ac
ceptance the Cardinal dean genuflects be
fore him, asking him by what name ho
shall be known to Christendom in the fu
ture, and by thjs name he is known ever
after. The new Pope is taken to the al
tar, where he is clothed In the pure white
robe of the Sovereign Pontiff. The dis
tinguishing color of the Pope is white, of.
a Cardinal red, of a Bishop purple and of
a priest black. Enthroned on the altar
the Pope receives the obedience of all tho
Cardinals, the Cardinal chamberlain plac
ing on his hand the Fisherman's Ring.
In the meantime the masons remove tho
Wall under the arch over the balcony, and
all go In procession to the balcony over
the main entrance to the Vatican. There
the Cardinal dean proclaims the election
to : the people waiting outside. Thr
lowing Sunday is generally set apart tor
the coronation of the new Pope. He Is
carried -by the highest nobility in pn
sion, the Cardinals. Archbishops. Bish , s.
the Ministers and Embassadors of foreign
nations, the pontifical army, whose of
ficers are nobles, composing the proces
sion. The Sfciss Guards do duty by
guarding the procession. It enters St.
Peter's, where for the first time the new
ly elected Father of Christendom and
Vicar of Christ ascends the oldest
most venerable throne in the worldâ the
throne of Peter. From this throne he
looks down upon his subjects scattered
over the whole world. All nations and
peoples are his. He reigns not alone from
sea to sea and shore to shore, but b
very hearts of the faithful also. The sun
never sets on the territory of Great Brit
aln; but neither sun nor moon ever s
the Pope's subjects. â  For Catholicity
means Ã¼biquity; only death or resiK!:^.
tion can dethrone him. Here a very
touching ceremony takes place before his
throne. Best the Pope should be carried
away by the power he wields and blinded
by the gilded pageantry of the world, the
master of ceremonies draws near to tho
Pope and burns a little tow or flax on a
silver tray, repeating three times, "Sic
transit gloria mundi" (thus, Holy Fathi r,
all the glory of the world passes away).
Solemn high mass is sung, during which
the Pope receives the pallium from the
Cardinal dean. The pallium was once the
distinguishing garment of the Jewish high
priest.
After mass the Pope goes to the balcony
of St. Peter's, where his miter, which
belongs to him as Bishop, is removed and
the dean places the tiara on the Pope's
head. The origin of the tiara is not dear
ly historied. It is symbolic of his office
as Pontiff, priest and king. It has en
circled his honored brow .for ages, while
every other monarch only wears for his
crown a single circlet of gold. I.
first circle of the tiara is center*
universal headship of the Catholic church,
one fold and one shepherd. In the * I
the supremacy of jurisdiction as pastor or
shepherd; and in the third circle is ca
tered the temporal dominion which iho
Popes enjoyed over a thousand years.
Although- the tiara only dates from about
1340. yet the thing symbolized by it dates
back to Christ's commission to Peter.
The last act of the coronation of the
Pope is the taking possession of the
Basilica of St. John Lateran, the old. Bt
church in the world. Here the Popi a
lived for over a thousand years, but since
the Popes took up their abode at the Vat
ican they still go to St. John's solemnly
after their coronation to take possession
of their cathedral. At the portal of St.
John Lateran the arch-priest pr.
a gold cross to the Pope to kiss. He is
presented with keys of the Basilica, one
key of which is of pure gold and the
other of virgin silver. The vast proces
sion takes its way to the large couacil
hall made famous by kings and emn
men of letters and historic personages of
past ages and from this balcony the Pope
addresses' the people and distributes large
alms. He then, returns to the palace of
the Vatican.
Unless things change greatly before the
next election it is probable that the next
Pope will pursue the policy of the present
one and remain a prisoner within the
walls of the Vatican, as a protest to the
powers that be against the spoliation.
and robbery committed by the
Italian Government in seizing the
papal territory. As in our country
the District of Columbia was cut
off from the States of Maryland and Vir
ginia to form the independent territory
so as to render Congress absolutely tree
from the State authority and influence,
so also the Popes had from the remotest
times a small territory around Rome
which they governed as king.
In 'this way they were free from the in
fluence of the European powers. Such
territory is absolutely necessary for the
Pope in governing 250,000,000 people. lii 3
mail and telegraph are sacred things,
and all such communications should be
free and guarded from the sacrilegious
hands of the Italian Government. At the
present time this is not so; he is often
ruthlessly deprived of his rights. 'Tis
true his kingdom is not of this earth
terrestrial, but a spiritual kingdom liko
unto the kingdom of Christ, who said
"My kingdom is not of this world." The
Italian law is "might is right," and so
the Pope is crippled in the administra
tion of his church. Temporal things
don't last always and it may be that the
next political upheaval in Europe may
restore to the Popes their cherished
rights and give them back what was
theirs for over a thousand yearsâ the
papal dominions.

BEAUTY IS NOT
"SKIN DEEP."
By Mme. Hygeia.
This department is for the benefit of all these who are interested in
the science of cosmetics and the hygiene cf proper living. If any one
desires information on either of these subjects the questions will be
cheerfully answered in those columns. Write as often as you like, ask
as many questions as you pler.se and sign any name that you choose. Ad
dress all communications to Mme. Hyeeia, Sunday Gall.
BEAUTY is not "skin deep. I->on t
you believe a word of it. Real true
"beauty of the enduring sort lies
away, down deep in the character
and disposition. A pretty face and a fig
ure of perfect proportions never yet mail
a truly beautiful man.
If there is not a pleasing personality,
a frank and cordial manner, together
with sufficient sense to walk in out of a
hailstorm, why. the pink and white com
plexion, the eyes of heavenly loveliness
and the white and shapely hand won't
amount to a canceled postage stamp.
These are but the external embellish
ments of a structure that will not with
stand the storms and weathprbeatings of
Time unless- underlying it is something
more enduring than mere physical love
lines?, such as sweetness of character
and a cheerful, love-compelling tempera
ment. So, in your effort to enhance the
physical don't forget that the mental
needs refurbishing also.
Furthermore, there cannot be perfect
beauty without perfect cleanliness.
â  "Cleanliness is next to godliness."
That's another aphorism with which 1 am
inclined to find fault, for to my mind
cleanliness comes 'seforc godliness. I do
not mean by that that I think it discounts
in its results physically the practice of
all the virtues, but I do think one has to
be clean before one can be good.
I once asked a fastidious youth what at
tribute he most admired in woman.
"Neatness," he replied, without a mo
ment's hesitation. When one walks down
Kearny or Market street and observes the
number of women who seem to be filling
the role of a sidewalk mop. gathering
up with the hems of their gowns the
sweepings of the streets, whose faces are
painted and plastered until they look as
though they would crack if they smiled
and whose hair parts Itself all over the
head in little sticky strands, ore cannot
but agree with the aforementioned youth.
With her skirt all frayed at the edges,
her fingers sticking through the ends of
her gloves and â -:-...- on
her boots a woman Is not the winsome
creature that she might be .were perfect
neatness and order the predominating
characteristics of her toilet. We all in
stinctively line the clean, people and hate
the untidy.
I would also suggest that you gewn
yourselves correctly. Try and keep in
mind the eternal fitness of things. When
you have on an old â¡BUS frock, don't
top it -jIT with a dressy, delicate-hueu
hat, and don't Insist upon wearing white
gloves un all occasions, no matter how
soiled the gloves may be. If you must
wear white gloves, then keep them white.
Five cents' worth of gasoline will clean
several pairs of cloves, and will take but
a few minutes of your precious time.
If your dress is a bit worn and shabby
it really doesn't matter much, so long as
your skirt is whole and well brushed.
your shots nicely blacked, your neckwear
fresh and clean and your scolding locks
pinned neatly back. These are little de
tails, but they count tor a whole lot in
the make-up of an attractive woman.
Oh, yes. and let me beg of the little
women not to try and lose themselves
under a heavy hat of enormous propor
tions, and of the big ones With round, fat
faces not to tog themselves in little
round affairs that give to their heads the
appearance of a child's balloon with a
doughnut perched atop it. . :
Clothes tell a story of themselves. A
Frenchman, I think It was. once said:
"Show me a woman's clothes at different
periods of her life and I will tell you her
history." m m Â§
; As a "lastly" to to-day's Beauty Talk
I would like to add some ' ! n*ts' which
I stumbled across the other aay and
which I think might be pasted on the
â back of many a woman's hand mirror.
They are: Don't worry. Don't hurry.
Don't overeat. Don't starve. Breathe
fresh air every day and night. Sleep
and rest a great deal. Spend less nerv
ous energy every day than you make.
Be cheerful. Work like a woman, but
don't be worked to death. Associate with
healthy people. Health is contagious as
well as disease. Don't carry the whole
world on your shoulders, far less the
universe. -

ANNETT Aâ Treatment for 'oily skin
with large, open pores calls for warm
water, pure Castile soap and a lotion for
softening the water. The following is de
lightful: Alcohol, four ounces; ammonia
(purest and best), one ounce; oil of laven
der, one dram. Add one teaspoonful of
this to two quarts of water when you
bathe your face. Be sure not to use a
drop more than the directions call for.
Too much of the lotion makes the skin
too dry, but when used in the right pro
portions it Is excellent. For heavens sake
do not bleach your hair. If you have a
luxuriant head of hair you should be a
happy girl, and not complain because it
is not blonde. If you could read some of
Â» the desperate appeals that come to me
concerning heads that possess only three
or four tiny wisps of hair you would con
gratulate yourself on your great good
fortune.
CHARLOTTAâ When massaging the
little lines under the eyes always rub
upward and outward. Those swellings
under the eyes ' show either lack
of rest or lack of good, robust health.
Bathing them with witch hazel to which
a few drops of camphor have been added
will subdue them somewhat. Those little
white spots under the skin ire results of
congested pores, the tiny openings havir.g
become so ciogged that the sebaceous
matter, not being able to expel itself has
gathered into a tiny ball. The spot* are
usually very painful and cannot be
squeezed out. since there is no op*>n;n"
t*iere to be broken. The only way "that
they can be doctored is by taking a very
fine needle, puncturing the skin and pick
ing i.. little white things out. If a little
toilet vinegar is immediately used there
will be no scar whatever and the little
peÂ«=ts will never return. â¢ <â¢â¢

Of course you can use Another ream in

stick to that one. My dear little girl, if
you never put anything more objection

homemade cold cream, no one will ever
accuse you of "making up." The -"made

the rouged cheeks and the penciled' eye

heartily as you do. I have never advo
cated that sort of thing and heaven for
bid chat I ever shall. Here is a recipe
for a shampoo that will make your hair
fluffy and nice: Take half a pint of al
cohol and in it shake up the yolk of an.
egg. Strain, and you will have a clear
fluid that will keep indefinitely. Pour two
tablespoonfula of this in the water in
which you wash your hair and rub it
well into the scalp and through the long
ends. Rinse in warm water, wipe with
warm towels and fan until dry. It cer
tainly iÂ« not the sponge bath that dis
agrees with you. You must be ailing in
some way. You really ought to be able
in half an hour to give your toilet all the
care that is necessary if you are sys
tematic about it. I mean that In that
time you should be- able to take your
sponge bath, brush your hair, care for
your nails and coddle your complexion.
So tlon't be discouraged, but go along
in the way you have begun andâ my word
for itâ you will come out winner in the
end.
THERESAâ very sweet of you to

pleased that my advice was helpful to
you. Do I "ever answer questions other
than those pertaining to beauty?" Yes.
if they happen to be upon a subject with
which I am conversant. I can give you
the information on good form which you
desire. It certainly is very bad form to
wear showy clothes to church. Your
walking dress and street hat. or any of
the au;eter costumes in your wardrobe,
would be more appropriate than the one
you describe. That should be kept for
visiting or the matinee. No, it is not the
proper thing for a young lady to
lunch or dine at a restaurant * with
a man unchaperoned. There are, of
course, circumstances of convenience
that make it permissible, but these
conditions should be imperative, for
it is not an elegant thing to do. and dis
regard of the rules along this line
cheapens a girl deplorably. If you have
no mother, then go to some older woman
friend and get her to advise youâ and fol
low her advice even if by so doing you go
against your impulses and sacrifice" a Jew
"good times." if you have any further
questions along this line I shall be more
than pleased to answer them. In any cir
cumstances, write to me again.

your very appreciative letter. If you ob

it. I do not believe a real skin food can
be made without "grease," as you call it â
that is, without any oily ingredient. Here
is a formula for a simple skin food that
is free from animal fats: Two table
spoonfuls of oil of sweet a!mond3 and one
teaspoonful of best rosewater. Beat to a'
cream and add three drops of camphor
and two drops simple tincture of benzoin.
The preparations you mention I know ab
solutely nothing about: never heard of
them. If your skin food gets rancid in a
short time iÂ« must be because the ingredi
ents are not pur* 1 . I use it right along*. Mine
never gets rancid, but keeps for months.
If you will use a few drops of oil of lilac
in the cream you will find that it will re
tain its fragrance. Following la the recipe

professors In a great Eastern college, of her Intention to marry Coleman and.
In spite of the fact that Coleman was at one time a favorite pupil, the match
-* Is most bitterly opposed by him. He arranges a trip to Greece hoping to .pre

try his affection she treats him coolly and announces . her .trip to Greece, He
misunderstands, and the result Is they say- good-by In a most matter of fact
manner, but Marjory rushes In tears to her father fully convinced that Cole

In drink. The professor arranges to take some of his students with his family
to Greeceâ among them a young sophomore named Coke, who has .distinguished
himself in a freshman rush and js regarded by Coleman In the light of a
rival. Coleman gets an appointment as war correspondent of the Eclipse for
the war In Greece and sails via London. On the steamer he meets Nora Black,
a celebrated dancer and an old friend, who pays him marked attention
Coleman rather slights the attentions of the fair Nora and In .turn Is him

this news ... the sunlit square made him betray.no weakness, but- -in i ine
darkness of his room at the hotel he.'seemed to behold Marjory encaaeu
by insurmountable walls of flame. .He could look out ot his window into

porters and sending them scampering to accomplish everything, tie ( even

In the morning a steamer .carried them across the strait and lantled
them near Mesalonghi; at the foot of the railroad that-leads to. Agrintofi.
At Agrinlo'n Coleman at last began to feel that he was neanng his goal..
There were plentv ot soldiers in the town.' who received with delight and
applause this gentleman in the distinguished looking khaki clothes with
his revolver and his field glasses arid his canteen and his dragoman.. The
dragoman lied, of course. a:id vociferated that the gentleman in t life dis
tinguished looking khaki clothes was an English soldier of reputation, who
had naturally come to help the cross in its light against the' crescent. He
also said that his master had three superb horses coming from. Athens In
charge < f a groom, and was undoubtedly going to join the- cavalry. \\ re
upon the soldiers wished to embrace and kiss the gentleman In the dis

There was more or less of a scuffle. ', Coleman would, have taken to
kicking and punching; nut he found that by a 'series of-elusive movements
he could dodge the demonstrations -of affection withpur losing'. his popular

gence which was to take him and others the next stage of the journey.
As the diligence' proceeded Coleman's mind, suffered another little inroad
of ill faith as to the 'success of his expedition. In the first place it ap
peared foolish to expect that this, diligence would ever arrive anywhere.
Moreover, the accommodations were about equal to what one would endure
if one undertook to sleep for a night in a tree. Then there was a devil
dog, a little black-and-tan -.â¢-â â  a blanket gorgeous and- belled, whose
dutv it was to stand on the top or the' coach and bark incessantly to keep
the" driver fully aroused to the enormity of his occupation. To have this
cur silenced either by strangulation or ordinal clubbing Coleman strug
gled with his dragoman as Jacob struggled with the gel. but in the first
plac^'the dragoman was a Gre-e-k whose tongue could go quite drunk, a
Greek who became a Slavs to the! herakimgiind establishment of one cer
tain fact or lie. and now he was engaged in describing to every village and
to all the eountrvside the prowess of the gentleman in the . distingu
looking khaki clothes. It was the-gene'ral absurdity of this advance to .the
frontie- and the lighting, to the crucial place where he was rcsolvee. to
make an atte>mpt to rescue his wee heart; it was this ridiculous- aspect
that caused to come to Coleman a premonition of failure. . No knight ever

He returned at las* to "tremulously say thai there was no single. chance of
starting for Arta that night. Whereupon he was .again thrust into the
street with orders, strict orders. In due time Coleman spread his rugs
upon the floor of- his little .room and' thought himself almost asleep, when
the dragoman entered 'with -a really intelligent man who for some reason

he could catch it. permission from' an officer having already been obtained.

moving to the edge of black water and- -embarking in a black bo.at filled
with soldiers whose rifles dimly shone was as- Impress! to Coleman as if

the last one' always touched him as being "final.
There were no" lights on the brigantine and the men swung. precariously
up her Â«=ideÂ«lo the deck, which was already occupied by a babbling multi
tude The dragoman judiciously found a place for his master where dur
ing 'the night the latter had to move quickly every time the tiller was
shifted to starboard. The craft raised her shadowy sails and swung slowly
off into the d-^ep gloom. Forward some of the soldiers began to sing weird
minor melodies. Coleman, enveloped in his rues, smoked three or four
cigars. He was content and miserable lying there hearing these melodies
which defined to him his own affairs. . . " â¢
At dawn thev were at the little port, First, in the carmine and gray

his dragoman positions in one of the first boats, but of course.it could not

landed with their traps. Coleman felt through the sole, of his ooot his

man- he retreated from everything difficult in a smoke of gibberish arid
gesticulation. Coleman glared at him with the hatred that sometimes
ensues when breed meets breed, but he saw that .this man was indeed a
golden link in his possible success. This man' connected him with Greec
and its language. If he destroyed him he delayed what was now' his main
desire! in life. However, this truth did not prevent him from addressing
the man in inelegant speech. . -.^ -. : -.

portant cruel truth, hut Coleman, after all. was takingâ as well as he
could forgetâ a solemn and knightly joy- of this adventure, and there were
as manv portraits of his lady. envisioning -before him as ever held the heart
of an armor-encased young gentleman of medieval poetry. If he had been
traveling in th!Â« region as an ordinary tourist he would. have been apparent
mainlv for his loftv Impatience over trifles, but now there was inhirn a' j
, positive assertion of directions which was undoubtedly one of -the reasons
" for the desnair of the. accomplished dragoman. . \ Vf -â¢ .
Before them the country slowly opened and opened, the. straight white
road always: piercing it like a lance shaft " Soon they could see black
rras*es of "men marking .the green knolls. The artillery thundered loudly
and now vibrated augusTly through the air: Coleman quickened his pace,
to the despair of the little men carrying the traps. They finally came un
with one of these black bodies of men and found It to be composed of a
considerable number of soldiers 'who w-otc idly watching some, nospitnl
people burv a dead Turk. The dragoman at once dashed forward to. peer
through the throng and see the face of the corpse. Then he came and
supplicated Coleman as if ho were hawking him to look at a relic, and
Coleman, moved by a strong, mvsterious impulse, went forward to look
at the poor little clav-eo]ored body." At that moment a snake ran out
frem a tuft of grass at his feet and wriggled wildly over the sod. The
dragoman shrieked, of course, but one of- the soldiers put his heel upon
the head of the reptile and it flung" itself Into the agonizing knot of death.
Then the whole crowd now-wowed, turning from the dead man to the dead
snake. Coleman signaled his contingent and proceeded along the road. â 
This Incident, this paragraph, had seemed a strange introduction to

As they drew nearer they saw that the inky streak was compoted of
cavalry, the troopers standing at their bridles. The sunlight flickered
upon their bright weapons. Now. the dragoman developed in one of his
extraordinary directions. He announced forsooth that .an intimate friend
was a captain of cavalry in this command. Coleman at first thought that
this was some kind of mysterious lie, but when he arrived where they
could hear the stamping of hoofs, the clank, of weapons and the murmur
of men, behold, a most dashing young officer gave a shout of joy and he
and the dragoman hurled themselves into a mad embrace. After "this Brat
ecstacy was over the dragoman bethought him of his employer, and iook
ing toward Coleman hastily explained him to the officer. The latter, it
appeared, was very affable indeed. Much had happened. The Greeks and
the Turks had been fighting over a shallow part of the river nearly oppo
site this point and the Greeks had driven hack the Turks and succeeded
in throwing a bridge of casks and planking across the stream. It was
now the duty and the delight of this force of cavalry to cross the bridge
and passim: the little force of covering Greek infantry to proceed "Into
Turkey until they came in much with the enemy.
Coleman's eyes di'ated. Was ever fate less perverse? Partly in
wretched French to the officer and partly in idiomatic English to" tho
dragoman . he proclaimed his fiery desire to accompany the expedition.
The oificer Immediately beamed upon him. In fact, he was delighted. The
dragoman had naturally told him many falsehoods concerning Coleman,
incidentally referring to himself more as a philanthropic guardian and
valuable friend cf the correspondent than as a plain, imviirzushed, dragro
"They Were Idly Watching Some Hospital People Bury a Dead Turk ''
man with an exceedingly good eye for the financial possibilities of his
position.
.. Coleman wanted to ask his servant if there was any chance of the
scout talcing them near Nikopolis, but he delayed being informed upon Ibis
point until such time as. he could find out secretly for himself. To ask ttii
dragoman would be mere stupid questioning, which would surely make the
animnl shy. He tried to be content that fate had given him this early
opportunity <>Â£ dealing with a medieval situation with some show of proper
form; that is to say, armed, a-horseback nnd in danger. Then he Could
feel that to the gods of the game he was not laughable, as when he rode
to rescue his love in a diligence with a devil dote yelping a-top.
With some Sourish the young captain presented him to the major who
commanded the cavalry. This officer stood with his legs wide apart eat
ing the rind of a fresh lemon and talking betimes to some of his officers.
The major also beamed upon Coleman when the captain explained that the
gentleman .in the distinguished looking khaki clothes wished to accom
pany- the expedition. He at once said that he would provide two troop
horses for Coleman and the dragoman. Coleman thanked fate for this
behavior, and his satisfaction was not %yithout a vestige of surprise. â¢ At
thnt time he judged it to be a remarkable aminbillty of -inflividuals. but in
later years he came to believe in certain laws which he deemed existent
solely for the benefit of War correspondents. In the minds of Government?,
AVar Offices and generals they have no function gave ono of disturbance,
but Coleman deemed it proved that the' common .men, and many uncom
mon men, whÂ«-n they go away to the fighting ground, out of the sight, out
of the hearing, of the world known to them and are eager to perform,
feats Of war in this new place, they feel an absolute longing for a specta
tor. It is indeed the veritable coronation of this world. There Is not too
much vanity of the street in this desire of men to have some disinterested
fellows perceive their deeds. It Is merely that a man doing' his best In the
middle of a eea of war longs to have people see him doing his best. This
SUNDAY CALL.
feeling Is often notably serious if in peace a man has done his worst or
part of his worst, Coleman believed that, above everybody, young, proud
and brave subalterns had this itch, but it existed, truly enough, from lieu
tenants to colonels. None wanted to conceal from his left hand that nia
rlg w 'i alld was performing a manly and yaliant thing, although there
might be times when 'an application of the principle would be immensely
convenient. The war correspondent arises, then, to become a sort ot a
cheap telescope for the people at home; further still, there have been
fights where the eyes of a solitary man were the eyes of the world; oho
spectator whose business it was to transfer, according to his ability, his
visual impressions to other minds.
Coleman and his servant were conducted to two saddled troop horses
and beside them waited decently in the rear of the ranks. The uniforms
of the troopers were of plain dark green cloth and they were well and
sensibly equipped. The mounts, however, had in no way been picked;
there were little horses and big horses, fat horses and thin horses. They
looked the result of a wild conscription. Coleman noted the faces cf the
troopers, and they were calm'enough save when a man betrayed nimself
by perhaps a disproportionate angry jerk at the bridle of his restive horse.
The major, artistically drooping" his cloak from his left shouHer and
tenderly and musingly lingering his long yellow mustache, rode slowly to
the middle of the line and wheeled his horse to face his men. A bugle
called attention, and then he addressed them in a loud and rapid speech,
which did not seem to have an end. Coleman imagined that the major
was paying tribute to the Greek tradition of the power of oratory. Again
the trumpet rang out, and this parade front swung off into column
formation. Then Coleman and the dragoman trotted at the tail of the
squadron, restraining with difficulty their horses, who could not under
stand their new places in the procession, and worked feverishly to regain
what they considered their positions in life.
The column jangled musically over tho sod. passing between two hiils
on one of which a Greek light battery was posted. Us men climbed to the
tops of their fntrenchments to witness the going of the cavalry. Then the
column curved along over ditch and through hedge to the shallows of the
river. Across this narrow stream was Turkey. Turkey, however, pre
sented nothing to the eye but a muddy bank with fringes of trees back of
it. Jt Beemed to be a great plain with sparse collections of foliage mark
ing it, whereas the Greek side presented in the main a vista of high, gaunt
rocks. Perhaps one of the first effects of war upon the mind is a new
recognition and fear of the circumscribed alility of the eye. making all
landscape seem inscrutable. The cavalry drew up in platoon formation
on their own bank of the steam and waited. If Coleman had known any
thing of war he woutri have knewn, from appearances, that thero was
nothing in the immediate vicinity to cause heart -jumping, but as a mat
ter of truth he was deeply moved and wondered what was hidden, what
was veiled by those trees. Moreover, the squadrons resembled an old
picture of a body of horse awaiting Napoleon's, order to charge. In the
meantime his mount fumed at the bit. plunging to get back to the ranks.
The sky was without a cloud, and the sun rays swept down upon mem.
Sometime;? Coleman was on ihe verge uf addressing the dragoman, accord
ing to bis" anxiety, but in the end he simply told him to go to the river and
fi-U the canteens."
At last an order came and the first troop moved with muffled tumult
across the bridge. Coleman and his dragoman followed the last troop.
The horses scrambled up the muddy bank much as if they were merely
breaking out of a pasture, but probably aM the men felt a sudden tight
ening of their muscles. Coleman. in his excitement, felt, more than he
saw, glossy horse flanks, green-clothed men chumping in their saddles,
banging sabers and canteens, and carbines slanted in line.
There were some Greek infantry in a trench. They were heavily over
coated, desnite the heat, and some were engaged In eating loaves of round,
thick bread. They called out lustily as the cavalry passed them, The
troopers smiled slowly, somewhat proudly, in response.
Presently there was another halt and Cole-man saw the major trotting
busily here and there, while troop commanders rode out to meet him.
Spreading groups of scouts and flankers moved off and disappeared. Thvir
dashing young officer friend cantered past them with his troop at his
heels. He waved a joyful good-by. It was the doings of cavalry in actual
service, horsemen fanning- out in all forward directions. There weie two
troops held in reserve, and as they jangled ahead at a foot pace Coleman
and his dragoman followed them.
The dragoman was now moved to erect many reasons for an immediate
return. It .was plain that he had no stomach at all for this business and
that he wished himself safely back en the other side of the river. Coleman
looked at him ankance. When these men, talked together Oilman might
. as well have been a polor bear for all he understood of it. When he saw
the trepidation of his dragoman he did not know what it foreboded. In
this situation it. was not for him to say that the dragoman's fears were
founded on nothing-. And ever the dragoman raised his reasons for a rer
treat-. Coleman spoke to himself. "I am just a trifle rattled." he said to
his heart, and after he had communed for a time upon the duty of Bteadi
ness he addressed the dragoman in cool language. "Now. my persuasive
friend, just quit all that, because business is business, and it may be
rather annoying business, but you will have to go through with it."
Long afterward, when ruminating over the feelings of that morning, he
saw with some astonishment that there was not a single thing within
sound or sight to cause a rational being any quaking. He was simply
riding with some soldiers over a vast tree-dotted prairie.
Presently the commanding officer turned in his saddle and told the
dragoman that he was going to ride forward with his orderly to whero he
could see the flanking parties and the scouts, and courteously, with the.
manner of a gentleman entertaining two guests, he asked if the. civilians
cared to accompany him. The dragoman would havo passed this question
lncorrectly on to Coleman If he had thought he could have avoided it, but
with both men regarding him he considered that a lie probably meant in
stant detection. He spoke almost the truth, contenting himself with
merely communicating to Coleman in a subtle way his sense that a ride
forward with the commanding officer and his orderly would be a depress
ing and dangerous occupation. But Coleman immediately accepted the in
vitation mainly because it was the invitation of the major, and in jvzlt it
is a brave man who can refuse the invitation of a commanding orticer.
The little party of four trotted away from the reserves, curving in s-ingla
file about the water holes. In time they arrived at where the plain. lacked
trees and was one great green lake of" grass; grass and scrubs. On this
expanse they could see the Greek horsemen riding, mainly appearing as
little Mack dots. Far to the left there was a squad said to be composed of
only twenty troopers, but in the distance their black mass seemed to ba
a regiment.
As the officer and his guests advanced they came in view of what one
may call the shore of the plain. The rise of ground was heavily clad with
trees and over the tops of them appeared the cupola and part of the walls
of a large white house and there were glimpses of huts near it as if a
village was marked. The black specks seemed to be almost to it. Tho
major galloped forward and the others followed at his pace. The house
grew larger and larger and they came nearly to the advance scouts, who
they could now see were not quite close to the village. There had been a
deception of the eye precisely as occurs at sea. Herds of unguarded sheep
drifted over the plain and little ownerless horses, still cruelly hobbled,
leaped painfully away, frightened, as if they understood that an anarchy
had come upon them. The party rode until they were very' nearly up ivltn
the scouts, and then from low down at the very- edge of the plain there
came a long rattling noise, which endured as if some kind of grinding
machine had been put in motion. Smoke arose, faintly marking the posi
tion of an intrenehment. Sometimes a swift spitting could be heard from
the air over the party.
It was Coleman's fortune to think at first that the Turks were not
firing in his direction, but as soon as he heard the weird voices In the air
he knew that war yas upon him. But It was plain that the range was al
most excessive, plain even to his ignorance. The major looked at him and
laughed; he found no difficulty in smiling In response. If this was war it
could be withstood somehow. He could not at this time understand what
a mere trifle was the present incident. He felt upon his cheek a little
breeze which was moving the grass blades. He had tied his canteen in a
wrong place on the saddle, and every time the horse moved quickly thÂ«
canteen banged the correspondent, to his annoyance and distress, forcibly
on the knee. He had forgotten about his dragoman, but happening to look
upon that faithful servitor he saw him gone white with horror. A bullet
at that moment twanged near his head and the slave to fear ducked in a
spasm. Coleman called the orderly's attention and they both laughed
discreetly. They made no pretension of being heroes, but they saw plainly
that they were better than this man. .
Coleman said to him: "How far Is it now to Nikopolls?" The drago
man replied only with a look of agonized impatience.
But of course there was no going to Nikopolis that day. Ths officer
had advanced his men as far as was intended by his superiors, and pres
ently they were all recalled and trotted back to the bridge. They croasÂ«d
it to their old camp.
â  An important part of Coleman's traps was back with his Athenian
heroes and their groom, but with his present equipment he Could at least
He smoking on his blankets and watch the dragoman prepare food. But ha
reflected that for that day he had only attained the simple discovery that
the approach to Nikopolls was surrounded with difficulties.

their borrowed troop horses. The correspondent first went to the tele
graph office and found there the usual number of despairing clerks. They
were outraged when they found he was going to st:nd message* and
thought it preposterous that he insisted upon learning If there were any
Vfi the off:cefor him. They had trouble enough with endless official com
munications without being hounded about private affairs by a confident
young man in khaki. Hut Coleman at last unearthed six cablegrams which
collectively said that the .Eclipse wondered why it did not hear from him.

to Greece, that if he (Colcmai i In finding ttv Wainwright party

It, and finally the paper wondered twice more why it did not hear from
him.
When Coleman went forth to inquire if anybody knew of the where
abouts of the Wainwrlght party he thought first of his fellow correspond
ents. He found most of them in a cafe where was to be had about the
only food in the soldier-laden town. It was a slothful den where even an
ordinary boiled egg i i ide unpalatable. Such a common matter
as the saH men watched with, greed asd suspicion as if they were always
about to grab it from each other. The proprietor, in a dirty .shirt could
always be heard whining, evidently telling the -world that he was being
abused, but. Me had spirit enough remaining to charge three prices for
everything with an almost Jewish fluency.
The correspondents consoled themselves largely upon black bread and
the native wines. Also there were c< rtain little oiled fishes and Â«ome H 'reen
odds and ends for salads: The correspondents were practically all 10ns-
Hshmen. Some of them were veterans of journalism in the Soudan in.
India, in South Africa: and then? were others who knew as much of war
as .th^y could learn by pitting at a desk and editing the London stock
reports. Some were on their own hook: some had horses and dragomen
nnd some had neither the one nor the other; many knew, how to write and
a few had it yet to learn. The thing in common Was a spirit of adventure
which found pleasure in the extraordinary business of seeing how men
kill each other.
They were talking of an artillery duel which had been fought the pre
vious day between the Greek batteries above the town and the Turkish
batteries across the river. Coleman took a seat at one of the long- tables
and the "astute dragoman got somebody in the street to hold the horses
in order that he might be present at any feasting.
One of the experienced correspondents was r-marking- that the fire of
the Greek batteries in the engagment had been the finest artillery practice
of the century. He spoke a little loudly, perhaps, in the wistful hope that
some of the Greek officers would understand enough English to follow his
meaning, for it is always good for a correspondent to admire the prowess
on his own Bide of the battlefield. After a time Coleman spoke in a lull
and describing the supposed misfortunes of the Wainwright party asked
if any one had news of them. The correspondents werÂ« surprised; thpy
had none of them heard even of the existence of a Wainwright party.
Also none of them seemed to care exceedingly. The conversation ;oon
changed to a discussion of the probable result of the. general Greek ad
vance announced for the morrow.
Coleman silently commented that this remarkable appearance of in
difference to the misiiap of the Wainwrights. a little party, a single group,
was a better definition of a real condition of war than that bit of long
range musketry of the morning. He took a certain dispatch out of his
pocket and again read it. "Find Wainwright party at all hazards; hiucfi
talk hei.e;- success means red fire by ton. Bclfptfe." It was an important
matter." He could imagine how the American people, vibrating for years
to stories of the cruelty of the Turk, would trembleâ indeed, was now
tremblingâ while the newspapers howled out the dire possibilities. He saw
all the kinds of people, from those who would read the Wainwright chap
ters from day to day as a sort of sensational novel to those who would
work up a gentle sympathy for the woe of others around the table in tho
evenings. He saw "barkeepers and policemen taking a high gallery' thrill
out of this, kind of romance. He saw even the emotion among American,
colleges over the tragedy of a professor and some students.

She sets oft a scene. Which does not im

stage "prop," designed for ornamentation
or to display the art of 'Mme. Cbapeau
or Mme. La Mode.
But with her histrionic ability Miss Van
Buren has a queenly beauty that is not
given to all of Eve's grandchildren. A
little fluttering ah! always escapes from
the ladles In the audience when she ap

proper environment of silks, velvets, laces
or whatnot, but It takes a woman to ap
preciate the details.
My lady In front of the footlights, how
ever, has no idea of the troubles of my

But when each week means a change of
play It also means weary, dreary hours
at the dressmakers'. As many as four
different gowns are sometimes required
for one play. It would never do to wear
a gown that the public would recognize
as having served duty for another part.
Actresses not being sisters, or even first
cousins to gilt-edged Croesus, despite the
fabulous salaries which they draw in

even triple duty. Hut the dear public

gowns the problem of making six entirely
different looking gowns is successfully
grappled with. It is done by Ingenious
combinations.
One may have a model upon which the
dressmaker puts the brunt of the fittings,
but even so the drudgery of trying on
cannot be entirely avoided. Nor can all
be left to the taste of the dressmaker.
The play may require gowns of this, tnat
or the "other century. Dressmakers are
supposed to be just ahead of the times

Here^fs tbe Â©niÂ£ Bumboat TOcman on tbe Coast
THE only bumboat woman on this
coast toils hard on the water
front through the long hours of
the day to the lonely midnight
ten. And then she takes the
last car home. '
She has walked through thirty years
of her life's busy calendar, over pre
cisely the same rough and cheerless
path, and always takes the last car
home. The strange, â¢ unpoetical story
of her life is filled with the patient, un
tiring devotion of a mother's love,
whose sacrifices are as human as they
are eternal, and she makes them for
the child she bore.
Mrs. Burns is the bumboat woman,
and her daughter Mary is the child.
The mother's sacrifice will have Its re
ward; her daughter has been gradu
ated at the Notre Dame Convent, and
iiext fall she will go to Europe to fin
ish her musical education. The daugh
ter she has slaved 'for will enjoy the
ndvantagos denied to herself.

and the most eceonomical. By dint of
energy and unequaled frugality she
has accumulated- a small fortuneâ all
made by peddling at ,the water front.
She now owns some of the most desir
able property In this city, and the
deeds are recorded in the daughter's
name. *â¢â ./
This bumboat woman Is now nearlng

and trilled Irish ballads as she passed
along.
There was a stranger who listened
nlsir, and after she had finished he told
her of that wonderful Eden. Califor
nia, where money was plentiful and
voices like hers were rare. The next
year, 1868, the peasant girl sailed for
California all alone to .try h^r fortune
in that wonderland of the West.
The streets were not paved with gold,
and she found voices as sweet as her
own, which required money to culti
vate it.
It was the beginning of a life as suc
cessful as It has been exceptional; for
It began in California's palmy days,
when the weight of the nuggets and
gold dust overbalanced in payment the
worth of the articles, Just because a
woman sold them.
Fortune smiled upon her efforts;
shipping became more prosperous, and
the sailors patronized her liberally.
The bumboat woman invested her
earnings in real estate, her property
increased in value, and a glorious pros
pect shone upon her life. She might
yet obtain the education she had
courted.
Thon she met her fate. It was a
case of love at first sight: and so she
became a bride in 1871. Her happiness
was short lived, for she was left a
widow when her daughter was a babe.
P rhaps more men take off their hats
to this bumboat woman than to any
other woman in San Francisco, but it is
because â she is crosseyed. There are
still some tars remaining who remem
ber even to-day the dire disasters that
befell ship and crew when this form of
exorcising the hoodoo was neglected.
It If said that she was the last person
who left the gangplank of the ill-fated
Colima, and that the sailors in their
superstitious fears drew back pantc
rtricken, with the cry. "Oh, she'li sink;
we'll never touch land again!" If hers

from its covering, leaving the larger part
of his eyes in the headpiece, "which hung

"After the labster had succeeded in the
division of bis head he was apparently in
a very exhausted state, for he remained
very quiet for a couple of hours and paid
no attention to the shrimps, which were
swimming close to him. When the, couple
of hours had elapsed I began to think the
operation had been too much for the lob
ster aijd that he was dead, but the shud

possible customers. Where the music
was the loudest, there she remained the
longest for she found the biggest crowd.
I walked sometimes ahead, some
time? behind her. until she reached
Jackson street. Then I said. "Didn't
they buy anything?"
"Ochâ it's a bad night. There's no
Bhippin', and there's no money from
the. poor Bailors. They hain't got
enough, they hain't got enough to
spend on liquor. I can't blame them for
taking a dropâ it's a bad night and I
wouldn't be out here if I didn't have to
beâ sun- now, that I wouldn't. This is
all I've taken In to-day."
She thrust her horny hand Into the
folds of her bedraggled skirts and
clutched tightly some loose pieces of
silver.
She counted them over to herself.
"Th. ic. now:" she exclaimed. "Just
think of thatâ only 45 cints and been
on my feet all day at that."
"And youjj lunch out of that, too." I
Interrupted. "Well, that Is too bad. I
think 1 will buy something."
"God bless you, good lady, come
under the light and thin you can see
what you're buyin 1 ."
She hugged the basket to her wiry
figure with delight at the prospect o"
making a dime, and stopped under the
light of a street lamp whose rays were
sufficient for the analysis of her face.
The upper half suggested "I'll Ret." and
the lower half said "I'll keep."
This, then, is the secret of her suc
cess.
She fumbled the goods over In her
basket like a ribbon clerk on bargain
day. Handkerchiefs, socks, combs,
elastic and pins, talking all the while.
"It's purty hard for a woman old
like me to be doin' this, but I'm
not complainln' about the people,
for it's the best city in "the world for a
woman to be makin' a dacint livin'.
Times are hard now, sure, but when

now and ain't so lively as I used to be.

And as I left her she was saying. In
her purring, Tipperary tone. "Me bless
in's on the path ferninst ye, darlint.
Faith, there's an angel at the other end
o 1 it."
In all probability this bumboat
woman will work until the eve of her
voyage to Europe with her daughter.
Meanwhile, she will toil hard on the
water front through the long tcdloxs
hours df the day to the lonely midnight
watch, and take the last car home.

previously experienced in that instead of
starting fr.>rn the head they were reversed
so that the body seemed to shrink from
the tail. This was varied occasionally by
a sort of a jump, which was effected by
the lobster doubling his tail under him
springing up in the water.
"Presently the shell nearest the head
split on 'the left side near the body and
opened about an eighth <>f an inch. An
other convulsion, followed by a jump, and
the second she!! split. This part of the
opt ration, which reminded me somewhat
of a dance thai had its origin in this coun
try at the World's Fair, was repeated un
til all the shells were loosened on the left
side. The lobster once more began the
squeezing process, and after half an
hour's hard work finally got clear of the
shell cr.'.irely. lying down by its side for
a rest which lasted for thn c days.
"The shell looked much the smaller
of the two, and save that ii was mo
tionless, might have been taken for a
live and healthy crustacean in full
dress. The naked lobster did not look
at all like his old self. If is colors' were
so bright as to suggest that he had
been parboiled, and he had the tender

A sweat- shop, moreover, means long

Ceaseless toil at starvation pay is tht

There are mental sweat shops where

The master of the telephone compnn\
courts visitors. Some of his subscrib
ers receive ...... to go
through iht- telephone building and ' ex-:
amin. the workings of the system; The
bujldir.s leaves nothing* to be desired in
the matter of cemfo: liibie conveniences,
ar.d gives no opportunity for criticism.
There are twu questions, ho-v.-over, which
the pleasant* official; who. is taking, you
through, will avoid.- He will keep you sc
interested in other things that you' may
not think of asking them. He .will walk
you up and. down the long roorri ' where
the operators sit at their -boards. -He will
let you listen to them say "Number?"
tften deftly place the plug and give the
switch, lie will tell you anything you
choose to ask about the intricacies oi
making a switch.
He will take you down- to ' the roorr.
where "Sunset." by the turn of her hand
makes it possible for people hundreds o:
miles apart to speak to each' other, lit
will explain to you how this is accom
plished. He will escort you to the bis
lunch rciom, where the company provide!
a luncheon far the girl 3, and into the sit
ting room, attractive with its restful, eas\
chairs. -
Then you may happen to . ask these
questions: "What hours do the girls
have?" and "What pay do they receive?'
If you do. to the first interrogation th*
officer responds: "Oh. their hours are' a
different; they are coming and going al
cay. To the second he says: "They arc
paid according to their ability' as oper
ators â advanced as they improve." .
You leave the official imbued with thÂ«
idea that the life of the telephone girl
must be almost as., pleasant as -that, of tht
harp players x>t heaven. You haven't
found out what hours the girls have nor
what pay they receive,- but if. you give it
a second thought you will feel sure that
a company which seems to provides*) wei
for the comforts of its employes, doubtless
has a fair schedule of working hours ant

Which two things the telephone com
pany has not. -These are the rocks upor
which the company founders judged frorr
the humanitarian standpoint. The . tele
phone company criminally overworks tht
girls and' shamelessly underpays them. 1
pay this in the fullness of a seven-days'
working knowledge among them. I went
into the telephone company unbiased and
without malice aforethought. â 
A wave of sympathy i"oi- the telephone
girl has followed in the wake of the .re
cent suicides. It was not until several
girls sought death by the poison route
tnet the popular feeling toward the tele
phone girl c hanged. Her cause is being
ihampiuiicd, but,' alas:' neitner wisely nui
well.
'I nese are the main facts with which thfl
champions assail the company. The teua
phor.e- girls must wear either black or
blue drt-tfs-es. If they wear shirt' waists
they must be white. Color is taboo.cd.

These are the main complaints wliie-h

company. The.se are the harrowing rea

are set forth as the causes of. suicide
among the telephone girls.
Small wonder that the telephone ?om

pany is cackling, up its ample eve at
such agitation. There isn't a person of
tare .i'.Mgnient who could upun sobÂ°r re
flection condemn the company for any o.f
the aforementioned rules. "A ten-minute
introduction .to. the- telephone stem will,
convince normal intelligence that they are
necessary. â¢.. â 
"Yes but th.ese.nre the things the -fdrls
complain of." say the agitators. So they
do. of these and twice- as many more
necessary evils. And every one is so busy
hunting, for the motes that no one marks
the beam. :. : â¢
There Isn't any r.eed of tiiting at wind
mills. ; It doesn't help the telephone, girl
nor harm the company.- "Central" is
abused. "Central", rioes develop melan
cholia. ' "Central's" thoushts do turn sui
cide-ward,- nor always stop at the deed. â 
There is one unnecessary reason for this
state of .iffairs. It's because â â¢.â â¢â¢
1= worked far beyond the rrMiirancc'nf
the average girl . Body find brain cannot
stand it. It's fagâ physical and mental
fag--th'p.t drives the telephone girl to the
rbrink of death and sometimes- over it.
It's that which drives^ them, to the shnir.e
rind despair of worse Mian death.
It is inrpossible to get into tlif "tele
phone- office without more or â¢ loss in
fluence. Some one has to pull a wire for
you or it is cut of the question. "Some
one" may pimply be a friend of a friend..
etc.. or he may be a real" i body."
The "somebody" who did the act for me
occupies a corner in the financial world
iird n niche in the world political. Tne
magic; of his name signed to'- my letter
of introduction was. an "open â¢ sesame"
that .swung wide; the; doors lending into

A boy in uniform had; to make several

i.n the rotund presence of Mr. Glassâ for
lie didr.'t ask me to. be seated. He was
very pleasant 1 telling me that they turned

pecial effort in my case to give me im

rather sharply and was -evidently going
to ask seme question* 'when hi? eyp asrain
fell on the signature of the'letter. . "You
need no further recommendation." be
said, as I bowed myself. "out; Three days
later I received- a r.ote tilling- me to re
port for duty.
Th' first â  day that I spent in the
telephone office I shaU always remem
ber as 'one 'of the b'lnck-lettt r 'unpleas

constant terror. of " meeting an- acquaint

ir,g in .the telephone office at a salary of

after. ' â 
I was assigned- to SunFe*. office, which
has its own room in the big building. 1
came at S in the morning and was al
lowed to use the el/-vator. For some in\
fathomed reason .the- company allows Â»he
girls to. ride in thÂ»" elevator if. they go up
during the early morning hours. At ;:!1
other times, -up or down, they "must fr->t

The chief operator gays.me a cap and
a seat. . My solo .... day was to
listen to the' operator next to me in pr>ler
to. learn the method of answering a sub
scriber. At 12 o'clock I had half an hour
for lunch.' There, were about thirty cirls
in the lunclr room, where ted: beans.- br.; ar]
and butter were placed, on heaping platters
by the; matron. A number of girls hart
brought â  additions, to -rill nut the' menu
offered by the company. But there aae
plenty- to eat and it was of the best
quality: . . " â  . " .
"Lucy is taking a 'bath' grail I -lay."
I heard a girl to -the right cf me say.
â 'She takes Cne down here every we;cfc.
They can't have a bathtub at home.' I
should think she'd be ashamed to adver
tise the' fact by using these."'
â¢ ".These" are six porcelain tubs with lioi
and cold ... re at the disposal of
the girls. It is a thoughtful convenience,
for the bath is an immediate antidnte
p.gainst "that tirod feeling." I d!sco\>'
t-re<l that the girls rather resented ihr
bathrooms, regcrdirs; then as insinua
tions against their hora< > comforts. That
which they miscall "pride" prevents them
from using them and calls forth disparag
ing, remarks about those who do make it
a habit.
At 3 oVlock I was giy^n a ten-minute
recess, which I spent in the sitting-room.
Two or three girls were; standing $ before
a bulletin beard. "Have you read this?"
asked one. "O, I beg pardon. I thought
it was Grace."
I told them that I was in Sunset office,
and they immediately- introduced them
selves and plied me with questions and
advice.
"You want to watch this bulletin." said
one. "You can always find cut why the
last girl was dismissed. They write the
ruie which she has broken on here as a
warning." ;â  V
"It will take you â â¢:â  weeks to learn if
you're quick." said another. "That's the
time most girls need. Really, though, it
takes a year to make a good operator,
doesn't it. girls? Well, my recess is up.
I must go."
So was mine, and I went back to "Sun
set" office, to 'llt.' cap that irritated me,
the receiver with Its film of sickening
moisture, and the siience ... galled.
There isn't any denying that it is "hard
not to be allowed to speak. But there

The two chief -operators I thought un
necessarily "bossy." They gave their
orders or asked questions in strident, ag
gressrve voices that rasped. Several
times 1 took off m;. cap to wipe out the
moisture. "You'll have to stop that,"
said one of the "ladies"â which title the
chief operators have earned by right of
might.
Late in the afternoon one of the
"ladies" called out a name in a voice that
menaced ill ... .... Twice she

ungraciously given, that my day's work
was over. I had been in the office nine
hours with thirty minutes for luncheon
and ten minutes recess. -Every nerve in
my body was crying for rest. The' con
stant-strain of fitting erect, keeping the
eyes glued straight ahead, and the ears
attuned, exhausts beyond belief.
At !t:3O the next night I was again at
the board. Through shifting my tim^ thus
I had gained an unusual rest. Until 12
o'clock we worked under the same rigid
rules that he!<f good during the daytime.
At VI the chif f operator left and one of
the regular operators took charge. We
were now allowed to talk to our neigh
bors. From 12 until 5 in the morning
Sunset is rarely busy.
It was torture for me to keep awake.
The hours seemed days. At 5 in the morn
ing; however, the frultmen began calling
for numbers. - and their Dago-Frahcy-
Hlpr'ano-Americano . kept me on the
guess and awake. At <:30 we parted, a

The next night only the thought that
I would be allowed to' mak* my first
switch made me re-turn to the oij-c-r. it
was impossible for mi- to interchange the
sleeping and making hours of years'
habit: 1 had tried to sleep during the day
without success, A severe cold and a
violent headache made life seem anything
but pleasant.
1 had been there perhaps half an hour
when the chief operator ordered mi to
take off my ribbon stock. In a mument of
l orgetf utness ; l had put on a pate blue
ribocn with my t:?.ck gown. " -.
I meekly tool it off and straightway
commenced to sneeze. To a polite request
to be permitted to replace the ribbon, I
was informed ... l had no business
wearir::; a colored ribbon and that. It was
mv own funeral if 1 caught my death cf
cold. 1 ask d thai I be allowed to go
down to the lockers and _â :]... black
boa. "You can get 'it p.x. your recess;
you'll stay where ycui are now," was the
reply.
I made two switches that night and was
beginning to understand the systemâ oven
to recccnize some â â¢..â â  of out-of
town Sunset offices.
I . left the office in the morning with
the two girls who were my right and left
hand neighbors. As we turned the corner
a man accosted me. He looked and Â«puke
like a gentleman, pretended to have made
a mistake, and then urgently invited us
to breakfast.
We hurried on. "It's a wonder you
didn't want to go, Alice," said the other
girl. Alice was a be-curled creature of
THE SUJNUAT CAJjIi.-
the sort who would make tweet eyes at
Caliban.
"Pshaw.!" replied Alice; "I'm on to
them. Some one's been talking about me.
That's one of the company's spies. I'll bet
my hat. I know I've seen him some
where." â¢ â tVK'^ 'Yv- â 
The next afternoon I went down to the
office to ask to be put on the day force,
for I could not stand the night work. 1*
was told if I couldn't stand the work
there were others who could. One of the
girls In the lunch room suggested that 1
see Miss Sheridan. Miss Sheridan ie a
"real lady," quoth my informant, who evi- .
dently thought otherwise of the ladies >
officially called chief operators.
Miss Sheridan, traffic manager, Is one of
the most charming women I have -ever
met. She is loved and respected by all
the telephone girls. A woman, tall and
stately, in a position that bespeaks at
least thirty-five years, she looks scarcely
twenty-five. A sweet gracioueneas and
rare sympathy cling to her every word
and act, â¢
In diverse ratio as Miss Sheridan is
liked, co is Miss Kennedy disliked. I did
not during my week's experience- have a
personal encounter with Miss Kennedy.
I saw her once or twice, and must con- â¢
fe.ss that I was repelled by her. It is
Miss Kennedy's duty to lis*?n over the
line. If she wills she can hear any or
every operator. She immediately reports
the slightest infraction of the rules on the
part of the operators. Nine out of ten
operators lope their positions through
Miss Kennedy's report. The doors of the
telephone company are forever bolted and
barred to b dismissed operator.
It Is unfortunate ' but necessary, that,
the comDanv use the "listening" method.
Unfortunately there Is no mechanical de

deserves the feeling which exists, I did
not discover.
An hour after I spoke to Mips =>hendan
I was again called to her office and
told : -^ on the day force
commei - the morrow, which meant
t hat I â  ' that
night rt the following morning
*t 11 1Â».
I worked that night, again making a
switch. In the morning I went out for
brpakfa*'. ard rame back to the office im-
mediately. At 11:30 the matron woke me
frnm a ilu >l sleep and I reported to the
local rocm to which I had been changed.
Here there were new and different details
to be learned. The room was much larger
than that of "Sunset" with more than
twice as many operators. One long table
was devoted to the "800"â a dozen girls,
and the chief "800" a pink-cheeked
goiflen-haired maiden.
I worked untli Sunday night. I now
felt partly initiated and thoroughly un
derstood the workings, though I manipu
lated clumsily. My hours, nine in all.
were from 11:30 until 9:30. On Sunday
night I told them that I would not re
turn again.
It la only by actual experience that one
can realize trie health-breaking work of
the telephone girl. I should never have
believed it without going through it my
self. Scarcely a day passes that some
girl does not faint at her work.
The telephone system requires peculiar
-wearing labor. Mr. Sabin requires
one girl to suffer nine hours of It. The
nÂ«.- system cannot be changed.
But Mr. Sabln can reduce the number of
hours and put the telephone office on a
plan above the sweat-shop.
As long aa there are girls in the world
who have to work Mr. Sabin will find no
difficulty filling 'the positions, though he
Be t he hours to ten.
A telephone girl should not be made to
â¢work over seven hours a day including
tne thirty minutes for luncheon. This
would necessitate an additional force of
operators at $20 a month.
Perhaps it would be worth while. Then
if a telephone girl oommittted suicide Mr.
Sabln could plead not guilty at the bar
of her soul.

Cdith ' Evans T^TTs for the F^S*
?f ms the stcpy oF why She
to Â£31711711* .Strict-
IHAVE been asked a great many times
why I attempted to commit ppieide.
A number of people have hinted that
I did it just to follow the example of
other telephone girls who took their
live?. Tin think that suicide is
as catching as :â  mumps and that
it is epidemic among telephone p!r!s.
'T can truthfully say That I did not at
tempt to end my life because other girls
did. As far as I know I was the first of
the telephone girls who s-ou.arht death as
an end to trouble. If suicide really
â broke out' among the telephone girls,
then I am sorry to say that they must
have 'caught it' from me.
"I don't want to give the impression
that I think it an honor to have caused
a "suicide malady' among the telephone
girls. Nor Jo I think that my example
influenced the other suicides very much.
T simply want to show that I did not
drink carbolic acid because some other
telephone girl swallowed poison.
"As for {he reasons why I did attempt
to end my life, I really don't know just
exactly why I did it. People seerr. to
have at last realized that the telephone
girl is about as sinned against as sin
ning.
"They ask me whether I blame the
telephone company for the rash act. Of
course I don't blame the telephone com
pany directly, but I think that my work
in the telephone office was the Indirect
cause.
"If I hadn't been all unstrung from my
work I'm sure I should not have tried to
do anything 60 foolish. Telephone work
Is a terrible strain. It makes your nerve?
go t!ng-a-ling all the time. I have never
been particularly strong, and the con
finement and nervous strain of the tele
phone office is unbearably hard for a girl
Who is not full of vitality.
"Just imagine sitting in a chair all day
long hearing the same irritating buzz, giv
ing the same replies, being under cor.s-nrit
watch!
"A telephone girl lives In constant dread
of losing h. r position. She never knows
from one day until the next whether her
name will be on the bulletin board that
announces dismissals. You feel just as
though you were living with a sword
hanging over your head ready to fall and
chop it off at any moment.
"The hours are "\ cry long and you never
get any fresh air. If j-ou work during the
day you have half ar, hour for lunch, but
you eat your lunch !n the building. You
are s-upposed to hf.ve fifteen minutes a
day recess, but you don't get it every
day by any m< ana, and then never over
ten minutes. You can't go outside the
building during recess. About every two
weeks you get an afternoon off.
"If you work at night time it's just a3
bad. You sleep es much of the day as
you can, so you don't get any more ex
ercise.
"It's hard to make It clear Just whjr
telephone work Is so wearing. I don't
suppose that anything I have said ex
plains why I should have been in such,
a state that I tried to take my life. It's
a lot of little things that accumulate and
grow more irritating the longer you're
there. Of course it depends a great deal
on a girl's disposition.
"Then I think the hours are too long
for that kind of work. If we had shorter
hnurs we could stand the strain better.
When they ask the girls to work over
time the/ cant refuse. They pay Uiem
18 cents an hour. Mit most of them would
r&ther do without the money and not
have to work overtime.
"I had been ff-rling melancholy for some
time, but I- never thought of committing
suicide. I had been changed to the night
force, and I found that even more trying.
Sleep that you get during the daytime
never seems to do you as much good.
"On Monday night, going down to work.
I was invitPd to for the following
<3ay. I knew I ought to spend the day
resting but I just U>nsrpd to go. So, aftf-r
workii.g all night in the office, at 10 in the
morning I went to the picnic.
"We got back too late in the evening for
me to report at duty on time. . I tele
phoned that I was nf>t coming and went
home to bfd. My sipter scolded me for
going to the picnic and said I had prob
ably had an outing at the cost of my
position. I was too tired fmra loss of
Bleep to care and did not wake up until
late the next morning.
"My sister had gone down tn the tele
phone office early in the morning to find
out what action they were going to take
In my case. They told her they would
probably suspend me for a weekâ without
pay. of course.
"She was naturally very much put out
at me for having taken such chances of
losing my position and wished to give me
a lesson. So. instead- of telling me that
they would suspend me she gave me to
understand that I had lost my position. I
knew that it would be useless to tn' to
get it back, for unless the strongest influ
ence is brought to bear they never take
back a dismissed operator.
"Before my sister went out she intended
telling me the truth., as I was pufficiemly
punished. But she forgot to do so. I said
very' little, but I felt as though my world
had* crumbled into pieces. I prayed for
death.
"I felt 111 and so tired of it all. Why
not put an end to it? Over and over again
I repeated this. It was now noon; the
whistles were screeching and the air was
full of the midday clamor.
"On the washstand stood a bottle of car
bolic acid. Just a few swallows of that
and eternal quiet. I sat down and looked
at the bottle. The letters on the label
danced before my eyes. I must have sat
for about ten minutes morbidly deciding
whether 'to be or not to be.' I couldn't
think clearly, all sorts of trivial matters
kept darting through my mind.
" 'Nobody will care, nobody will care.' I
said, and swallowed the poison. The
agony and suffering I can not describe.
And when the doctor said I would live I
wanted to sing for joy. but my poor
burned throat made sound impossible.
"Two or three days afterward Miss
Griffiths called on me. She had lost her
position several weeks before and I knew
that she was very disconsolate. It was
hard for me to talk, but I told her how
sorry I was that I had tried to commit
suicide. How sweet life looks when it is
slipping away, how glad I was to come
back to it even through pain and suffer
ing beyond measure
"She asked me all sorts ft question*
about the poison. I never for a moment
thought she had a reason. I remember
she said to me Just before going: "So
you're sorry that you did it. Edith?" I
told her never, never to think of suicide.
She said good-by very sadly, but I
thought it was pity for my sufferings.
"The next morning I saw the morning
paper on a chair across the room. 'An
other telephone girl attempts suicide'
stood out in black lines. You can imagine
my horror when I read that it was Miss
Griffiths.
"She must have thought of it before om
lng to see me. but the sight of all my
agony and all my regrets over the rash
act failed to shake her purpose. They
saved her l!f*Â». too, and I heard from
Chicago, where kind friends sent her. that
she too thinks life worth living now.
"For two- months I suffered death in life.
The acid had burned me terribly. I was
willing to bear all the pain providing only
I might livp. My only reason for telling
my I'xporienre is that I want tn warn
other girls. I think we are very likely to
get morbid and I know that not a few of
the- girls have contemplated suicide. As
I said before the telephone company can't
be blamed directly if the girls develop
melancholia.
"But I hope that no more of them will
seek death. The poison cup is very tempt

HOW OUR NAVY CELEBRATED THE FOURTH AT SAMOA
O"f T no time in the history of the
f Bamoan [stands has the glorious
r~~J Fourth of July been more fitly
J observed than during the visit
of the United States cruiser
Badger.
6 o'clock !n the morning all the
is in the harbor were dressed in
their best suits of "bunting, the "Jackles"
â  l their i leanesi white togs and
the cooling. showers of the early morn
iiic had passed over.
The chief attraction' of the day was
th-- launching and cruise of the battle
ship "Missouri" (named so in honor of
Captain .Taints M. Miller, who hails
from that State). For several clays be
i there were mysterious
-;s on" up en top ot the forward
. many men of the carpenter's
pang were seen skulking around with
hanir*>rj:, saA\.s, boat gear, etc., trying
in vain to hide '.lie fact that something
was up,- "just to tickle the old man."
At 9 o'clock sharp the warning notes
of the herald, played on an immense
horn twelve feet long, announced the
approach of Uncle Sam, who, in com
pany with Admiral Farragut in his
flagship "Missouri" and the Secretary
if State, were to pay an official visit
to the English and German cruisers in
the harbor. Headed by the band, and
several fair damsels, ho scattered
roses in their wake, the procession
marched on to the quarterdeck, where
Uncle Sam and his retinue were duly
received .with '.ii naval courtesies by
Captain Miller and the officers of the
Badger, the admiral making an ap
propriate speech, which was ably re
iponded to by Captain Miller on behalf
of the three great powers represented
on board.
The meeting between Admiral Farra
gut ar.d Captain Miller was truly touch
ing, and th-.; admiral expressed both
his delight and surprise at being given
for his flagship the "Missouri," which
he hoped would prove as stanch and
true to the Union as was the State
after which she was named.
Twelve sideboys manned the star
board gangway, and, to the stirring air
of "Yankee Doodle," the admiral es
corted Uncle Sam on board the
"Missouri," which vessel lay proudly â¢
at anchor off the Badger.
When but a short distance away on
her trip to the English cruiser -Taur
anga, the "Missouri" hove to and there
â was much excitement visible on her
decks. A boarding officer was sent to
her from the Badger, and upon return
ing, stated that owing to careless
ness on the part of some of the work
men, the propeller had In some man
ner got tangled up with the foretop
downhaul, and she would be unable to
proceed on her voyage unless she re
ceived some assistance from the
Badger. Captain Miller kindly fur
nished the use of a steamer to tow the
"Missouri" across the bay to the
Tauranga, and was warmly thanked
by the admiral for his courtesy thus
extended. Thus, with the assistance
of the tow line, and some slight exer
tion on the part of the fireroom gang,
the "Missouri" duly hove In sight of
H. M. S. Tauranga, when' the royal
English ensign Was hoisted at the
main, and the usual twenty-one gun
salute was fired, which salute was an
swered, gun for gun, by the Tauranga,
The party were given a royal recep
tion by Captain Stuart of the Taur
anga. and all the honors of the English
nation were laid at the feet of .the ad
miral and Uncle Sam.
Captain Stuart and Uncle Sam were
closely closeted in the private office of
tho captain for some time, and it is
safe .to state that their conversation
may prove of some significance, bear-
Ing on the visit of the Joint High Com
mission to Samoa, but, be that as It
may", when Uncle Sam Joined the ad
miral on the quarterdeck of the Taur
anga, it was noticed that the face of
the former wore a very troubled ex
pression.
At 10 a. m. the "Missouri" proceeded
on her voyage, all the shipping in the
harbor dipping their flaers and saluting
her in various ways, besides parading
their marine guards with four, flour
ishes. /
As she steamed alongside the Nev, r
Zealand Government cruiser Tutanekai
she fired twenty-one guns, with the
English ensign still at the main, which
Balute was answered by that vessel, and
the admiral and Uncle Sam, accom
oanicd by his secretary and staff, were
which even the tenderest heart could not
consider at all worthy of any form of
assistance whatever.
The hall into which I am admitted is a
noble one. large and lofty, with open
doorways leading into wide and silent
rooms on either side and beyond, and a
sweep of curving stairs in the middle dis
tance winding up into the invisible.

less bric-a-brac and rare curios wherever

tuck their slender staffs, but they are
flags of only one designâ the stars and
stripes, which are our nations pride and
glory.
I am shown informally into the dining
room, a spacious apartment at the .'end
of the hall, flooded with sunshine through
an all-embracing bay-window, out of
which one looks loftily down from thi3
bold rise of California street upon that
low lying part of the city which stretches
between It ar.d the hills beyond.
There is a conservatory at the left, a

the arms of a most inviting looking chair;

and tedious way. She recognizes my
presence sub-consciously as it were, for
I am but an incident in this busy hour,
with which she has no personal concern,
and after one lift of her eyes she goes on
with her work with all the patient buc
apparently hopeless industry of the pour
princess of old who was condemned by the
wicked fairy to sort singing birds' feath
ers.
Only a minute or so passes before the
serene silence which settles down upon
me Is ended by the advent of a third per
sonâthe "Fairy Godmother" of the sol
dier boys. She comes In noiselessly, with
a light swiftness of movement which tells
much of the store of energy hidden under
her quiet exterior, and puts out her slen
der hand to me with winning cordiality.
She is rather a small woman, with hair
of reddish gold, in the soft flufflness of
which, however, there is far more than a
hint of shining silver, and a pale face on
which, though ' Time, has marked som>*
wrinkles, he has placed no lines which toll
of unkindliness or suspicion of her fellow
creatuies. Hers Is a sensitive faceâ one
which has been shadowed by grief and
wet with tears, but it is the face of a
woman who has learned whether in jjy
or sorrow to surmount the narrow boun
daries of selfishness and find her solace
and companionship in the broad fields of
humanity which lie beyond.
She is not dressed to "receive." for she
Is attired in comfortable but unassuming
fashion in a quilted jae-ket of white satin
and a black silk skirt, which has not. I
notice with mounting respect, the fash
ionable "dip" a,t the back. A glance at
the table as she seats herself brings Into
existence the faintest hint of a sigh.
"I always like to attend to all my own
letters." she says deprecatingly, "but
there have been so many of them since
that auction that I have found It quite
Impossible; such a number of them are
begging letters, too, that it is almost dis
couraging."
"Soir.e of them, though," she continues,
"many of them, in fact, are just lovely â
letters from friends and acquaintances
and strangers thanking me for what lit

tain Post, who, although an . officer in
the New Zealand naval reserve, fs an
American by birth, having been born
in the State where is manufactured
watches and clocks as well as wooden
nutmegs, and he has not forgotten his
boyhood training nor how to celebrate
the Fourth of July.
Captain Post insisted on the party
remaining on board his vessel until the
approaching squall blew over and all
that was possible to make their visit
pleasant was don by him and his offi
cers.
At 11 a. m., the storm having sub
sided, the Missouri steamed down the
harbor, all her bunting displayed and
tli" band playinpr "God Save the
Queen." As she neared the German
cruiser Cormoran the air was changed
to "Die Wacht am Rhein," the imperial
German ensign was floated to the
breeze and a salute of twenty-one guns
was exchanged between the two ves
sels of two mighty nations.
Captain Emsmann of the Cormoran
greeted the admiral at the gangway and
the entire party were escorted by the
Cormoran's band to the wardroom,
where political matters were discussed
and speeches of condolence in behalf
of the dead soldiers were made by
Uncle Sam and Captain Emsmann, ap
propriately responded to by the Secre
tary of State.
Proud indeed were the men of the
Badger when at 11:30 a. m. the Missouri
was seen steaming toward her, the
"homeward bound" pennantgaylytrail
ing astern. " As she recrossed the Tau
ranga's bow the band on that vessel
struck up "See the Conquering Hero
Comes."
Having finished her maiden trip
around the harbor of Apia, the Missouri
came to anchor at her moorings nÂ«ar
the Badger, when the admiral escorted
Uncle Sam and his staff aboard th.?
latter vessel in order to witness the
programme of sports for the day.
The following races were successfully
arranged under the able management
of Lieutenant Stirling: International
pulling and sailing race, potato race,
mast-head race, obstacle race, go-as
you-please race, three-legged race and
a pie-eating contest. The prizes in
each case were graciously awarded to
the winners.
A sumptuous repast was served in the
ward room for the visiting officers and
families from shore, while "Jack," not
to be outdone in hospitality, had an
equally tempting luncheon laid out on
the gun deck for the visiting crews of
the foreign vessels.
The Commissioners also had a quiet
little "fono" of their own, and a peep
into the consultation hall during the
height of the hilarities revealed all
kinds of good things with which the
tables were burdened. The genial
countenance of the Hon. Bartlett Tripp
was even more radiant on this occasion
and he was kept busy receiving the nu
merous visitors who thronged his cabin
doors.
As the day proceeded so did the
games and innocent amusements so
dear to the hearts of the Americans.
Now, as has been proven on previous
occasions, there is much talent on
board the Badger, and that fact was
again made evident when Lieutenant
Stirling announced a "cakewalk." This
was new to many of the foreign visi
tors, and much astonishment was ex
pressed that "jack was ' a versatile
creature." The prize â a ' irge choco
late cake â was presented t^ the win
ning couple in the contest, with many
blushes and a neat little speech by one
of the lady visitors.
The exhibition of strength, in lifting
200, 500 and 1000 pound weights, and the
wrestling match with a broom by the
local Sandow, were received with great
applause, also much astonishment on
the part of the native visitors. San
dow has a chest expansion of eleven
inches, and will wrestle with anything
from a broom handle to a brewery.
The sports for the day closed with
r sparring exhibition between Billings

In the evening Lieutenant Stirling
arranged for the visitors a beautiful
pyrotechnic display.

THEY EAT,
LIVE AND
SLEEP
IN THEIR
BOATS.
THE citizen out/for an early rnmhle
I will; if he direct his steps to Fisher-
I men's wharf, perceive what reminds
I him of a pat of dry hop poles
J^ blown by the wind. As he ap
proaches and peers down over the
railing surrounding the wharf he will
lf-arn that these are merely the masts
of fishing boats which have furled their
sails and lie at anchor.
Most of these boats coming in are load
ed, perhaps with sardines, and lie deep
in the water through the weight of their
shimmering load.
A good sized oat will hold 3000 pounds
cf fish, but few have that amount; pos
sibly the largest catch will be but 1500
pounds of sardines.
Tn this boat men dip them up with
wooden scoops, or tin basins, Into bas
kets, by which the; are drawn up to the
wharf and there emptied into boxes.
Over there they stand, almost to the
knee in the sliding, silvery mass, kicking
them into the baskets, stopping io pick
cut the herrings or smelts that chance to
be among the smaller fish.
Over here the boats have been cleared
of fish, have been washed and the oil
skin coats put away, together with other
evidences of their last right's work, and
the men are either preparing or eating
their breakfast before going out for an
other catch.
They have no makeshift meals as a wo
man might after a long fast, but cold
and hungry as they are. the soup or stew
must be well cooked fore it is eaten.
Flat loaves of Italian bread lie about
the boats wherever they are handiest.
They rest on the deck and lie among the
corks on the piled up nets. Bottles of
wine are propped up against the gun
wales and baskets of onions show the
fishermen's partiality for this vegetab'.e.
If home life can be said to exist on
fisher boats, one witnesses a species of it
here. A man lounges at full length upon
the deck of his boat, making entries in
a notebook; another smokes a short pip< j
and fondles the head of a little fox ter
rier which a friend lowers to him.
In another boat they are washing theii
nets, one man standing in the bow. an
other in the stern, and they dip them ur
and down, swish, swish, until every scak
and bit of seaweed is removed.
i";, above them the wharf teems with
life, and the sound of many voices and
tongues fill the air, for the venders arc
down and wagons frum canneries and fish
markets are driven among the nondescript
crowd.
Little Pictro Torri stands by the rail
mending his father's net as It Is drying.
In and out among the brown meshes goe?
the long shuttle, full of seine cord, and
the breaks are made whole again.
These fishers' boys are not bold like
those of our own race, and the slender
hand trembles :i little when I'ietro hears
himself addressed.
"Yes, I like mending nets." he replies,
keeping his great brown eyes on his work.
"Yph, once in a while my father eta m â¢
go out with him; when I've done more
mending than usual or on my saint's day.
Yt-s, I shall be Â«i fisherman; too, -when I'm
larger^-perhaps when I got so big that m
brother Paoll's rubber coat will lit me."
Four small boys; not of the Latin race,
hid behind some fish boxes which have
been filled and are waiting to be carried
to the cannery. The boys have two largo
sacks, much tailer than the youngest if
they were stood upright, and Into these
they drop the fish which they pull from
the boxes.
A great dun dog has followed his master
to â  .-I wharf and Is jumping about play
fully. He darts around the corner where
the young pilferers are hidden, and the
larger of the quartet, being Just at the
edge, goes into the bay with a splash, his
hands full of tell-tale fish. The mild ex
citement pervading the crowd changes to
wild alarm. One fisherman tins over his
bottle of wine, and the red stream stains
bis newly painted boat. Another Just com
ing down to the ladder to his craft drops
his bunch of carrots and the tide sweeps
them away.
The man drawing up a basket of her
ring near the spot quickly tosses the,fish
into the water and swings the basket to
the boy as he comes up, while the man
with the earrings, who assures us that
"the boy drowna," boldly plunges in and
brings out the thoroughly frightened
youngster.
Mary rentlni, who arrives just in time
to take in the situation and witness the
rescue, declares quit heartlessly that it
serves him right for stealing fish.
Then, the excitement having subsided,
she gives her father his breakfast, which
she brings to him every morning. Being
a special occasion, he has ravlolas, also a
pail of strong coffee.
Having dutifully discharged her errand,
she takes the visitors under her wing, so
to speak, and imparts more Information
regarding fishermen In general, and the
fishermen within immediate range of vis
ion, than they ever expected to know.
A white-faced man wheels a perambu
lator containing a sickly child along the
wharf and looks wistfully at the boats
coming In.
"Who Is he?" Mary repeats to a ques
tion, "that's Manuel Gnnco, and that's his
little baby in the buggy. It's mother's
dead. Do you know v.hat made, her die?
"She died because Manuel took his boat

why his wife died. The Portuguese are not

then come down and bargain for the
amount needed on Friday.
The slips at the wharf are all filled with
the boats, which require from four to six
men to man them, and the crowd upon the
wharf Is greater than In the rnoridng.
The boats have been out two, three, per
haps four days, and the fishers are anx
lous to dispose of their catch and seek
their homes.
A Neapolitan, less averse than the
othÂ»rs to talking with strangers, com
plains bitterly of the fishing steamer.
"I make plenty money before fishing
steamer come. I keep wife and children
I got plenty childrenâ too mucha.
Steamer take everythingâ striped bassa,

The crab catchers make their appear
ance with less pretension and i.iere li
little interest evinced Ip their cargo
They dump the sacks which contain thi
wriggling creatures down by tho scales
of some particular dealer, and those
they cannot sell are confined in the bar
nacle-covered crates scattered about
6wung into the water beneath the wharf
where the boats of the crab catchers are
anchored and fed upon small fish until
there Is a demand for them.
Among all the toilers of the sea the lot
of these poor crab catchers Is the hard
est. They must seek their cargo among
breakers and in the most dangerous loca
tions, and In spite of the hardships they
endure their earnings are pitifully --nail.
Many of the fishermen, and there are
more than a thousand of them in this
city alone, do not own the boat In which
they Fall, but give two-thirds of all fish
caught to the man who furnishes boat and
outfit. A fair sized boat with Its supply
of nets costs somewhere in the neighbor
hood of $1000.
Seven nets are supposed to be needful
to each boat; the gill net, or those for
sea bass, are the most expensive, costing
$1 25 per pound, while the drag net; some
times made of cotton instead of 'men. is
the cheapest. ;Â»'':
The fishermen are very careful of these
nets, and on Saturday one may see them
congregated in the low shed on the land
ward side of the wharf making and mend
ing these accessories of their craft, which
on their arrival at shore are seen draped
in amazing numbers over the wharf rail,
or spread at length upon the northern
arm of the wharf, where one walks
through a lane of nets.
Here in the shed with their nets they
do not seem so much masters of the situ
ation as in their boats. Speak to one of
them and the chances are that he will
pretend not to hear you, but will keep
his eyes fixed steadfastly upon thÂ«
meshes he is forming. ,\-
There is one industry at the wharf
which has no competition In this city. It
is that Of dyeing or tanning the nets and
sails the rich brown color one observes
in the latter when they are drifting out
to sea.
This industry was established thirty
five years ago by Captain Barlow, who
began business at the Clay-street wharf
when the fishing Industry was in its in
fancy here.
He died one year after removing: It to
its present quarters, and for twenty
years his son, William G. Barlow, has
tanned the fishermen's nets in the long,
low shed at the eastern end of the wharf.
Here above a brick platform are swung
five great caldrons, the smallest holding
two hundred gallons, and also the im
mense tanks In which the nets and sails
are plunged after being scalded for tix
hours in a decoction of oak bark, twelve
tons of which are used every year for
this purpose.
Most of the fishermen have their sails
dipped once a month, for which they pay
the sum of $5. The process is said, how
ever, to preserve them double the time
they would otherwise last.
As SOO boats anchor at the wharf, for
which privilege each owner pays $1 per
month, the occupation of dyeing nets Is
a considerable one.
Some time ago steam pipes for heating
purposes werÂ« introduced at considerable
expense, but the fishermen showed their
dislike of innovations so plainlyâ other
words grumbled incessantly about tho
caldrons boiling, though no fire was visi
bleâthat th pipes were taken out and the
Old and primitive manner resorted to of
building a fire upon the platform under
each separate boiler.
In this way confidence in young Bar
low s work was restored, for as soon an
the first fire was kindled the men wero
willing to vouch that it was bein"- well
done. CLARA [ZA PRICE
A POINTER ON
MOSQUITOES.
When a man hears for the first time
that it' is the female mosquito that
does all the bitin.e, it makes him feel right
glad. Further comfort is afforded by the
knowledge that the male mosquito has
probably the keenest musical sensibilities
of any of his class of animals. He has
quite a brush of hairs on his antennae,
and with them he hears. Mayer stuck
one of his kind on a glass plate and sound
ed tuning forks about. When one tonn
was made certain hairs would vibrate,
while all the others were still. Another
tone would start another set to vibrating,
and so on. Also, if the tuning fcrk were
at one side of the mosquito the hairs on
that antenna trembled most violently, so
that when the male hears, or rather feels
the voice of his beloved in one antennae,
he wheels about so that the vibration is
equal in both, and flies straight ahead to
meet her.
That is about all there is to the male
mosquito, though, except that he cannot
bite for the sufficient reason that he has
no apparatus with which to saw through
the skin. So to speak, he has the pumps,
but no drill. But the female Is thoroughly
equipped for getting through even a poli
tician's hide. The only mystery is what
possesses her to want to bite at all. How
does she come by her hankering for blood.
The scientists give it up. If she laid her
eggs in the wound, like the carrion fly,
it would be easy to answer the question,
but she doesn't. If she stung to defend
herself, like the wasp, it would be easy.
It must bo her brutal passion for blood
that prompts her to attack helpless
human beings. She cannoi cot this crav
ing by Inheritance, for the chances are
that none of b< r ancestors as far back
as William thi I lonqueror ever had a taste
of human blood, and yet, sit out on your
stoop of an evening and a mosquito,
ilf an hour out of the water, will
aa straight for you as if she had
been born for thai purpose. When one
thinks of the greal clouds of these tor
ments that live and die in swamps where
no warm-bl led animal ever cornea, for
fear of being mired, one can easily believe
the estimate of entomologists that not one
in a million ever samples red blood. â
