VOLUME L.XXXVIâ NO. 35.
AND THE
EAGLE SCREAMED!
NO wonder the eagle screamed '
yesterday. Not at the tons of
explosives detonated under
his flapping pinions, but for
joy of San Francisco's celebra- ,
tion of the Fourth. Never has
there been anything like it in the city's
history; never such spontaneous patri
otism: never such an association, of
memories, nor so much of Joy and color,
and music and noise; never so few and
such insignificant fires, and never so j
few people -who "didn't know it was j
loaded."
Match that if you can for a Fourth
of July record- Impossible!
A whole city was on its main streets
before the sun was three hours high,
formed in living walls spitting fire,
burning punk and money and exploding
with patriotism and civic pride to wit
ness a parade of fourteen long divisions
made up of the veterans of three wars
and the unhealed wounded of one; of
new recruits for battles still to come; of
cadets eager to attain the years that
crown a soldier, and of patriarchs who
shed their blood on "that dark and
bloody ground" in the war with "Mexico.
They were all In line. They may never
be together again till they ford the
dark river to enter the hills of eternity
beyond.
More than 2000 of the boys in blue of
Uncle Sam, infantrymen, troopers and
artillerists from the Presidio, marched
with them, erect, soldier-like, sturdy
equal to any fortune and half a
dozen Filipinos apiece. At least that's
what many In the admiring throngs
thought, and It looked that way to a
man in a window.
'"h" very siirht of the marching regu
lars, the cavalrymen on spirited horses,
the artillerists on foot and on their
guns was enough to swell with pride
the breast of every beholder who needs
must feel strong to think that such
walls of blue ever Intervene between
him and th<* foe. The soldiers seemed
to appreciate the feeling of the citizens
itnd put their best feet forward in the
march from the ferries to the re
viewing stand.
Through some oversight, the only
iat marred the perfect picture of
the parade, no men of the United
; navy were in line. Somebody
blundered and the men who fought
with Dewey, or who would have been
glad to have fought with him had they
had the chance, were not invited to
- ipate. Their absence was con
spicuous <nough to cause a great deal
mment, but it was entirely due to
lent and the public was content to
look instead upon the fine body of men
turned "lit in line by the California
Naval Militia. So well were they
hand: so sailorlike did they
rnanh, that many mistook them for
men from Uncle Sam's warships and
gave thpm round and round of pp
plause. It was a mistake, but it was
also a compliment, which rtie battalion
appreciated an i deserves.
Attract] ng a large share of attention,
'the cadets of the League of the Cross
made a splendid picture and ,were
greeted with waving nags and salvos
of applause at many points along their
line. There were many bands in the
.parade, but none of them put more vol
ume into their music or more spirit
than did the drummer? and fifers of
the league. Their beautiful uniforms
lent a flash of color to a part of the
line that- might have been repeated to
advantage' at other places.
The Native Sons made a good show
ing, but not as good as on former oc
casions and not such as was expected^
considering that the grand marshal
was one of their number. Th â¢>â¢ might
have been out in greater number and
expected to be, but the calls on their
membership from so many directions
were bo Imperative, that they had to j
bo content with a fair showing: one,
however, that did honor to their loyal-.;
ty to the Stars and Stripes and their
love of the old bear flag.
The German and Swiss citizens of
San Francisco had a fine representation
in the parade, th- turners and sharp
shooters in their uniforms of gray find-
Ing many applauding admirers in the
'â¢king crowds.
The members of the Italian colony
have also reason to feel proud of their
countrymen in line, the Garabaldi
Guard, the blue-bloused fishermen and
the ranchers with their floats adding
much to the ensemble.
The one feature of the pageant, that
which attracted by its oriental gor
gfousness and its utter oddity, was fur
nished by the Chinese residents, it was
near the end of the procession, but was
(i dream of bright color in fantastic
dress and trapping that, despite a lin
gering taste for things Celestial,
'â¢(impelled admiration. No such feature
could have been produced in any other
city of the country, and It was only
through the active efforts of Consul-
General Ho Vow that it was possible
.here. The occidental mind could im
agine no such a color scheme, no West
ern eye could plan such fantastic com
binations, and, if the truth be told, the
cis-Paciflc ear would not be tolerant of
the Tartar music. It was all there, how
ever, color scheme, fantastic conceits.

CAPTAIN C. L. HEWES of the Signal Corps, v/lth First lieutenant U.
W. Haseltine and thirty-five members in full dress on prancing bay
steeds, detailed as an escort to Major General Shatter, arrived at Fort
Mason, the military residence of the reviewing officer, at 10:30 a. m.
and at once reported to Major R. H. Noble, General Shafter's chief
aid. The escort in the meantime rested at ease on the main roadway outside
of the military reservation, while General Shafter and his staff, consisting
nf Majors Noble, Cosgrove, Green anri Gallagher and <'apt;iin E. Plummer,
were getting- ready. As soon as tins bad been arranged the major general
rode out and was receive.! by Captain Hewee and nifl company, and the line

famous daytime fireworks. They were |
not chary of their stock and added a
decidedly interesting feature to the pro- j
cession.
The newsboys and messenger boys, i
who brought up at the end of one of ;
the divisions of the procession, made <
themselves heard and felt, lending the
lung power of untrammeled young
America where it would do the most |
good to the general effect.
Even after the parade had disband- i
Ed and San Francisco knew that she
had outdone herself she did not rest.
Again in. the afternoon she gathered
her patriots to hear the story of the
birth of liberty and her country's prog
ress, to sing the hymns of the republic
and listen to the national anthems. Af
ter that the eagle screamed at will and
the patriotic small boy and his papa
were kept busy in the effort to carpet
the city's streets a foot deep with burnt
offerings at the altar of liberty.
As the dusk came on ajid the eagle,
husky voiced from continued exertions,
ceased to scream and roosted, the heav
ens above the peninsula and far out
into the bay and ocean were lighted up
by the combine'! fires of innumerable
pyrotechnic displays. Officially there
were three big ones; actually there
were ten times that number worthy of
note.
Some time past midnight the majority
of San Franciscans had sought their
drowsy beds, satisfied with themselves,
the world and the celebration. A few
firm in the belief that a good thins
should be pushed along were still busily
engaged when The Call went to press,
helping the Fourth towards Thanksgiv
ing day.

Promptly at 10 o'clock the signal gun

announcement to the waiting thousands
a|ong the iljie of march that the great
procession had started. Before the report
h;ni cited away there came the Quick.
spiriting roll of the snare drums, a crash
ing of cymbals and then the martial
strains of "On the Day That Dewey
Conies Home," and the long military,
naval and civic panorama began to unfold
itself before the eyes of the masses of
enthusiastic spectators.
The formation of the procession took
over two hours. The first three divisions,
which practically constituted the military
and naval display, got into line with more
precision and rapidity than thp others.
The head of the procession was formed on
Market street just below Montgomery,
the first, second and third divisions reaon
ing from Montgomery street on Market
to the ferry and overlapping several
blocks on East street. The other divisions
formed along the side streets and fell in
at their proper places in the procession.
Shortly before :i o'clock the band of the
Twenty-fourth infantry, which came in
rrmn the Presidio upon the cars, marched
up Battery streel and took its station at
the corner of Market. Next came the
regular troops under the comman.l of
Colonel Henry B. Freeman. They
marched down Market from Golden Gate
avenue, and the right flank, which wan
beaded by a battalion of the Twenty
fourth under the command of Captain
Ammi'ii A. Augur, began to form at the
junction of Second and Market. i'p <n
t'olonel Freeman's staff were: Major f3d
ward B. Moseley. surgeon; Lieutenant
Joseph D. r.eit< 'i and Captain Arthur C.
Ducat. The latter officer was severely
wounded at San Juan Hill.
Next followed 1200 of the regular re
cruits in three battalions, all under (he
command of. Major Owen J. Sweet. Then
came Batteries 1. O and E of the Heavy
Artillery under the command of Captain
Bedarwick Pratt. The latter battery was
commanded by Lieutenant John P. Hams,
who waa badly wounded in the Porto
Etican campaign. Light Battery C, Cap
tain Joseph ML '"aliif commanding, fal
lowed the heavy artillery, then Troop F.
Sixth Cavalry, and Troops D and H.
Fourth Cavalry. The medical <<>rp
brought up the rÂ»,ir commanded by Acting
Assistant Surgeon lieutenant Barney.
These commands formed in the t.rder
with the cavalry resting on East street.
Captain Rumboug'h brought over the hand
of the Third Artillery from Angel Island,
and this headed the heavy artillery.
At the same time that the military was
getting into position the Naval Militia,
N. <;. i.. under the command of Captain
Louis H. Turner, was forming on Baal
street. They fell into line directly bc
j iiind the cavalry.
While the second and third divisions
were forming, the first took up Its posi
tion between Battery and Montgomery
streets on Market. Chief Lees and Cau
tain Whitman in a buggy headed the pro
cession with twenty mounted police im
mediately following. Rifle companies A
and B, under the command of Captain
Spillane, with the drum corps of the Po
lice Department, headed by Andrew Ben
son, gorgeously arrayed as T'ncle Sam,
formed just in advance of Casassa's band.
Immediately behind the band came
Grand Marshal Stephen V. Costello with
his chief of staff. Colonel A. A. Borlini.
Then came the cavalcade of aids under
the command of Albert W. Lehrke. the
chief of aids. There were about twenty
In this detachment, the others being de
tailed with the various divisions. This
was the complete formation of the first
three divisions of the parade and was
kept intact throughout the entire line of
march. Just ahead of Casass&'a band i
was Troop A, First Cavalry. X. G. <".. Un- :
der Captain M. Burnett. The troop pre
sented a fine appearance.
The Regulars Look Formidable.
It was the general comment along the
line of march that the regulars made, a
very formidable appearance. The infan
try was in light marching order, and the
three batteries of the heavy artillery also
acted as Infantry. The guns of the light
artillery excited great interest. This bat
tery is a historic one. It is the famous
Gregg's battery, and saved the day for
the American forces at the battle of Bu
ena Vista in the Mexican War. The three
battalions' of recruits, despite the fact
that they have not been long in service,
presented a fine appearance and are a
magnificent body of men.
That the parade moved so smoothly is
largely due to the efficiency of the aids,
who kept the various organizations well
closed up in the line of march. The band
of the Twenty-fourth played almost con
tinually throughout the march and their
music helped to keep up the spirits of the
troops, who wore somewhat fatigued by
their march in from the Presidio.
The fourth division, which was under
the direction of Marshal Thomas K. Dunn
and his aids. Dr. AY. o. Wilox and Phil
, \V. Hammersmith, was composed entirely
of carriages containing the officers of the
day and invited guests with M. Ritzau's
band in the lead. In the first carriage
wen Mayor Phelan. George R. Fletcher.
1 president of the day; Secretary Robert
i W. Dennis and \V. J. Herrin of the
Fourth of July committee. The next car
â  riage was graced by the presence of Su
; pervisora Kalben and Attrldge, Merton C.
Allen, (/Tatar of the day, and Committee
man James Devlin. Judye Lawlor and
Treasurer Truman were given seats in the
same conveyance with Supervisors Lack
| raann and Deasy. Judges Graham and
Treadwell were placed under the protect
i ing wings of (Vmmitteemen Flinn and
Platt. In another carriage rode State
Secretary C. F. Curry. Cnmmitt â¢â¢email
Fred Raabe, School Director Head and F.

the latter w*>re not In the parade, much
to tlu-lr regret.
The rear guard of the division was
brought up by carriages, in which were
th<=> members of the Consular corps as
follows: 11. Matsu. Japanese Consul, and
suite; A. de Trobriand, French Consul;
C. Calderon. Honduran Consul, and J. M.
Tindes, Costa Rican Consul.
The Mayor Takes a Short Cut.
When the divisioT-. swung: into position
in the parade on Market street the car
riage containing Mayor Phelan and party
was inadvertently left behind and waa
compelled to trail along after the fifth
division for a few blocks. The driver
made a short cut up Pine street from
Montgomery, however, and managed to
slip into his proper place In the line as
the procession moved along Kearny
street.
The fifth division was marshaled by
John O'Keefe, assisted by Captain F.
Warren and Lieutenant Cyrus K. Legr
gett. First came J. C. Coggln's band,
followed by the Independent Rifles, which
organization made a very creditable ap
pearance under the command of Captain
L. Schneider, First Lieutenant E. Moen
ing and Second Lieutenant John Staude.
Then came two carriages with the gray
haired veterans of the Mexican War,
while Just behind them came a half
dozen conveyances in which rode the he
roes of a younger generation, veterans of
the Spanish-American war, who are con
valescing at the United States Army Hos
pital at the Presidio. The wounded and
sick were the recipients of a great deal of
attention all along the line and one sol
dier with the side of his face almost cov
ered with bandages concealing an ugly
saber wound was the special object of
sympathy on the part of the women spec
tators. As the procession moved slowly
up the street a number of ladies, who
had come fully prepared to carry out their
part of the programme, threw showers of
flowers into the carriages among the in
valids. They were amply rewarded for
their thoughtful kindness by the smiles
that lighted up the faces of the soldiers,
black and white, who were the recipient*
1 of their favors.
The turnout of discharged veterans of
! the late war failed to materialize, chiefly
owing to the fact that a majority of the
veterans remaining in the city are also
Native Sons and preferred to march with
their parlors.
Cadets Make a Fine Appearance.
The sixth division, which was composed
entirely of the League of the Cross Ca
dets, under the command of Colonel "Wil
liam P. Sullivan Jr., made an excellent
showing. There were in the neighborhood
of a thousand cadets in line and their
erect military bearing and perfect align
ment was the subject of much favorable
comment by the admiring throngs of
spectators that crowded the sidewalks
along the line of march. Their marching,
too was almost perfect and their neat
uniforms set off their youthful figures to
the best advantage. Colonel Sullivan
swelled with pride as he sat astride his
charger at the head of the column and
he had ample justification, for the or
ganization of which he is the active head
was not the least figure in the big Fourth
of July parade. The cadets more than
fulfilled the expectations of their friends
and. in marching and military' bearing at
least, some of the regular troops mijrht
well take lessons from them. The ladies
especially appeared to have a soft spot
in their hearts for the manly, soldierly
looking young men and bays and such ex
pressions of approval as: "Aren't they
just too sweet?" "They're perfectly
splendid," "They march better than the
regulars," were heard on every' side.
At the head of the division rode Mar
shal C. A. Macomber, accompanied by
his aids, Charles Bliss and D. P. Lowney.
A short distance behind rode Colonel Sul
livan with his staff and field officers of
the regiment as follws: Lieutenant Colo
nel, Thomas F. Ryan; surgeon. Major Jo
seph G. Morrissey: adjutant, Captain
John P. Duffy: commissary. Lieutenant
i Joseph A. Watts; inspector. Captain Dan

Close upon the h^els of the mounted of
ficers marched the regimental band and
! drum corps and between them the sixth
division was amply supplied with pa
triotic music of the latest brand, rendered
in the most approved fashion. After the
drum corps came the fifteen companies
in alphabetical order. First came Com
pany A. commanded by Captain William
c. Hopper and Second Lieutenant John
Long; then came Company B, commanded
by Captain J. T. Curley, First Lieutenant
Stanislaus Riley and Second Lieutenant

Tn.e Native Sons Out in Force.
Marshal A. K. Daggett, assisted by
I Fred Suhr Jr. and Walter T. Burke, di
rected the movements of the seventh
division, which contained many parlors of
the Native Sons of the Golden West and
also the various German societies.
First came Yon der Mehden's band, fol
lowed by Golden Gate Parlor nearly a
hundred strong, the members of which
were resplendent in. blue and yellow r .>
galia and yachting caps. Kach man car

Next in line were the members of the

SOME MOVING SCENES OF A GLORIOUS FOURTH
Sao Francisco Vereln. They turned out
in large numbers and made a splendid
appearance. First came the Schuetsen j
section In neat uniforms and with a mili
tary leering. Next came the Turner sec
tion wearing hats adorned with varl
colorr-d ribbons and gray uniforms. The
young members of the organization who
formed the. rear guard wore white yacht
lag c:ips and marched in section, thÂ» ;
members of each section carrying red, j
white or blue flags. A large wagon con- ;
tainlri? a number of little girls closed the :
division.
Then followed thÂ« eighth division with
Its naty looking Turners, uniformed com
panies of Bchuetzen Vereins and many
hundreds of bright and healthy looking
boys and girl?, the former on foot ana ;
the latter In grayly decorated wagons.
At the head of the division rode Oscar
Hocks, its marshel. and John VWisse, his
aid. Following in their wake was
an excellent band piaying patriotic
airs. to which the marching men
kept fine time. Behind the band
were the members of the S. F. T. B.
drum corps. About a half hundred mem
bers of the San Francisco Vereln Schuet
zen section came next and attracted much
rinxiro, by their soldierly appearance. Cap
tain F. Attinger was in command of the
company and F. Kommer rind Joseph
Btraube were his lieutenants. The Turner

THE BOYS AT MANILA.
'in his address at Metropolitan Temple yesterday Mayor Ph el an oeemed
to strike a sympathetic chord. Speaking of the late war with Spain and the
conditions it caused in this city, he salt!:
"â¢San Francisco was converted into a military camp, as many as iZo.OOO men
having- pitched their tents by the Golden Gate, and the very first regiment 01
them all mustered in was the First California, under the command of Colonel
James F. Smith. This San Francisco regiment was under the command of a
San Franciscan. Great as was his honor, it was soon to be magnified by tne
position given to our regiment among the expeditionary forces sent to the
Philippine Islands. Aboard the City of Peking, on the 25th day of May, it
was the first regiment to Bet sail from the United States for the purpose of
engaging a foe on foreign soil, and perhaps, ultimately, for foreign conquest.
â¢ â¢ â¢ No one who witnessed the march of the First Regiment from the
Presidio to the wharf during the early morning preceding the day of depart
ure will forget the stirring scenes. Fathers, mothers, wives children
friends of the parting soldiers thronged the streets and chef-red the gallant
army. The love of country, devotion to the flag, pride In the heroism of our
townsmen moved the people beyond the description of words.
â¢'Our boys sailed away, and their first exploit In the mid-Pacific was to
seize the Ladrones. for years a possession of Spain, and tnere raise the Amer
ican flagâ the first time that the flag was ever raised in the Pacific by au
thority of the Government.
"On their arrival at Manila Bay they soon engaged the enemy, and, alas,
many of our friends of yesterday fill heroes* graves to-day in that foreign land
-foreign no more, since their valor has consecrated it to freedom and
brought it under the protecting aegis of the United States.
"We find on the coat of arms of the city of San Francisco words (long
since Inscribed, but now the very voice of prophecy). 'Oro en paz. flerro en
euerra'-gold in peace. Iron in war. Happiness and plenty was the reward
of labor in this sunny land, fortitude and courage the characteristics of the
people when forced to the stern arbiterment of arms. This is the story of
San Francisco written upon its seal and completed by the glorious achieve
ments of the First California Regiment in this year of grace 1599. Just fifty
years after the discovery of the precious metals in our mountains the gold
of peace has been triumphantly transfused into the iron of war, and the writ
ten word has been fulfilled. ;' â â â â -â¢ â â 
"I saw the troops depart on that memorable day. bidding them a last fare
well on the deck of the City of Peking, and on the occasion of their return I
will greet them proudly In the name of the city they have honored by their
patriotism and valor."
bunting contained about fifty little chil
dren too young to walk and who derived
enjoyment living their flags at the gaz
in thousands. -The little ones were also
attired in their gymnasium suits and pre
sented a pleasing appearance. Nearly a,
thousand uniformed men and half that
number of citizens bearing the national
emblem composed the division.
The ninth division, headed by Marshal
A.doiph Becker and his aids, Antome
Klein Thomas Meyer, John Klndner,
Fred Kautz and J. Leffler, came next, va
rious additional sections of the herein
Eintracht constituting the bulk of tins
' 'First came A. Dijeau's band and the*
drum corns of the Verein Eintracht.
Then followed the Schuetzen section in
gray and green uniforms, with i.lack
plumes in their hats, under Lieutenants
Schmidt and Yon Hardwick. The Turner
section, under Commander Stahl, red
belt â â !. in neat uniforms of light gray, was
followed by the junior members of tho
Verein Eintracht. The Mission Turn
Verein, known by its immense straw hats,
preceded the handsome float of the Ein
tracht. which represented Germania and
Liberty.
Novel Features of the Parade.
Next came one of the unique features
of the parade, the Columbia Park Boys'
Club, led by its drum corps. All were
dressed in natty black and white and
numbered fourteen sets of fours. They
received hearty applause all along tho
line of march." Tne youngsters did not
falter, but maintained their sturdy step
to the very end. In their footsteps came
the -small boys who form the Lodce of
the Golden Links, under the command of
their captain, Roy Douglas.
Between the ninth and tenth division*
were three prettily decorated carts, one,
a fancy little dog cart, was driven by Miss
Bon a McClemon. A companion cart,
unique in Us smallness and beauty, pro
ceeded by its Bide. Miss May Pettce di
rected the course of a diminutive pony
similarly harne^ed. Mr. Meyer, in hi 3
automobile, patriotically bedecked, at
tracted much attention and interest.
Marshal Dalzell, with Guido Almagia
and Frank Mignet as aids, led the tenth
division. Captain Olmo, with martial
tread and carrying a destructive looking
sword, marched proudly at the head of the
Garibaldi Guards. The red shirts of Jho
guards, which tell the story of Italian
liberty, formed a striking contrast with
the black of their uniforms. The officers
and veterans of the Garibaldi Benevolent
Association followed in carriages.
The Scavengers' Protective Union' all
of whom are Italians, turned out fully
300 of its members. Each man carried the
stars and stripes, and they entered into
the spirit of the occasion with as much
enthusiasm as full born Americans. Fol
lowing the Scavengers' Protective Union
boys was the Ranchers' Association. The
officers of the Ranchers' Association rode
in three carriages, and Immediately after
them came one of the prettiest floats in
the procession. The first float, a veritable
vegetable garden, was drawn by six mug
nificent white horses. The sides of the
float were constructed with sacks of po
tatoes, bunches of beets, turnips and car
rots. Two hundred and fifty members of
the Fishermen's Association followed the
Ranchers' Association. They wore blue
shirts and white straw hats encircled with
blue ribbons. Their float, a thirty-foot
boa! with its white sail thrown to* th <â¢
breeze, attracted considerable attention
The Royal Italian Guards, under com
mand of Captain Zita. came next In the
line of march. They wore bright red shirts
and red caps Following the Italian
Guards the automobiLe, drawing two pas
sengers, glided along the pavement as
smoothly as an electric car.
Gorgeous Chinese Display.
Next came the gorgeous display of the
Chinese, the splendor of which can be de
scribed in the ancient, but in this case
strictly appropriate, phrase as "truly
Oriental." The Celestials outdid them
selves In preparation and in execution. ]
Their fantastic banners of richest silk and
the brilliantly colored floats extended over
ten blocks. Chinese Consul Ko Vow stated
that the cost of the display was about
$10,000. Their division won the hearty
and well deserved applause from Its form
ation to the end of the line of march. All
the Six Companies, the military' and so
cial organizations of the Chinese of the
city, were represented.
'T J Kllleen acted as marshal, assisted
by L. C. Ratto. Martin Tlerney, R. U

the head of the first section camÂ© the
members of United Parlor, Native Bons of

ners" of the parlor.
Two Chinese beating enormous cymbals
proclaimed the approach of the imperial
standards, whose gorgeousnes of color
was rivaled by the elaborate attire or
their bearers. The black disjointed char
acters or the glittering coils of the dragon
stood f'Tth sharply on the deeply tinted
Bei orting those cam.' the Cell
euards two by two. bearing battle axes
and staffs surmounted with shining brass
insignia. A flout draped in dark red con
taining a dozen gayly dressed Chinese
youngsters whs followed by a line of
mounted children, whose faces, clad In
bushy black whiskers, peered about with
an t xpresÃlon of ludicrous ferocity
Then came more puardp and hersKis,
with even more splendid banners, accom
panied by a body of fifty men. marching
in columns of fours, and following them
the resplendent float of the Tong
\ line of Mongolians In parti-col-
I ored vestments and peculiarly feathered
i headdresses preceded the shrill band of
i the Chinese Theater. The hideous dragon,
| with its enormous goggle eyes and flap
; ping ears, squirmed and colled its way in
i a most lifelike fashion through the
! streets. A body of spearmen, with wide,
flat hats, following closely in the rear,
lunged vicious stabs at the monster from
'. time to time. Fifty spearmen in grim
: black turbans and Tartar uniforms com
pleted the unique and extravagant display
of the Orientals. About twenty carriages
followed bearing the Chinese dignitaries.
Folowing the Chinese came the He
brew Orphan Asylum band, which headed
two hundred and fifty noisy delegates
I from the Newsboys' Union. Their laud-
I ed chief, Robbie Wall, and Max, the king
of the newsboys, led the patriotic youths.
The American District messenger boys,
commanded by Sergeant George Brown
and George Gottlng, and the San Fran
cisco District Telegraph messengers,
1 commanded by Captain Richard W. Pur
vis, marched next in line and gave vent
to their patriotic enthusiasm with fre
quent cheers all -along the line.
Last of all came a number of decorated
'â¢â  wagons, a handsome Japanese float in
| which several Japs amused themselves
< and the public firing off bombs that flew
â â  high in the air and bursting, released pa
per balloons in the form of horses, sheep,
; goats, etc.
Reviewed by General after.
The procession turned into Van Ness
avenue at 11 o'clock, but it was fully_half
ian hour later when the leaders." after
j countermarching at California street.
j passed in review before Major General
; Shafter on Van Ness avenue at Post
street. General Shafter presented an im
posing figure as ho . sat bestride his
charger, surrounded by his staff, consist
i ing of Majors Noble, Cosgrove, Green and
Gallagher and Captain Plummer. A de
j tachment of the Eighth Cavalry, forming
: the private escort, of the general, occu
pied a position directly In the rear of the
officers, while the official escort furnish
ed by the Fourth of July committee and
consisting of the signal corps of the Na-
I tional Guard was stationed on either
I hand.
As the battalion of police, who formed
i the advance guard of the procession,
reached the reviewing point it was de
i ployed to the side of the street near the
: general and his staff and stood at atten
] tion. As Grand Marshal Costello and his
I staff joined the party at this point, after
: going over the route of the parade, and
i Troop A of the National Guard, which
acted as escort to the grand marshal, took
its place along the side of the road. Colo
i nel Freeman, commanding the military di
' vision,, also joined his chief as his com
mand passed in review and remained with
! him until the parade dispersed.
A the various military bodies passed j
; the reviewing point the officers raised
their swords in salute to General Shaft i
the troops of cavalry likewise, the salu- i
tation being returned by the general. The
latter also punctiliously returned the sa
: lutes of such of the civilian organiza
; tions as bethought themselves of this
courtesy, but he reverently raised his
[ chapeau when the Mexican War veter
ans passed in front of him. and again
' when the wounded soldiers from the army
hospital saluted. General Shafter was a
clos< observer and every minute or so he !
turned to one of the officers at his side to
make some remark or comment on the I
| appearance of the marchers. The gorge
i ous costumes of the Chinese particularly
: appeared to strike his fancy and the little
| tots on the floats and the boys who
; struggled manfully to keep their ranks
I In the parade caused him to smile in an
approving manner.
The moment the last of the procession
: had passed on down Van Ness avenue
General Shafter and his staff, escorted
; by the Signal Corps.' set off at a brisk
â¢ trot for Fort Mason and with one last
look at the brilliantly arrayed horsemen
; the crowd began to slowly disperse. The
1 big Fourth of July parade of 1599 was a
1 thing of memory.
THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 5, 1899.
PATRIOTISM IN
WORD AND SONG
Metropolitan Temple Crowd
ed With Enthusiastic and
Country Loving
Citizens.
No end of enthusiasm was manifested
yesterday In Metropolitan Temple, in
' â¢which were held the literary exercises
!of the day's celebration. The literary
j committee, consisting of E. J. Banning,
E. W. Williams, B. Tarbox and T. Lyons,
j had spared no pains to make them at
! tractive. To make even intellectual en
i tertainment Interesting the surroundings
must be in keeping with the subject, and
; to this the committee gave special atten-
I tion. Around the galleries were shields,
; banners and drapings of the national col
i ors in softer shades than commonly em
ployed In large halls. From the celling
was suspended a swinging canopy with
ball of flowers attached. Above the ros
j trum was a star of hope and to the points
j hung more floral ornamentations. The
i rear was draped with American flags and
streamers.
Long before the hour scheduled for the
exercises to begin the entire seating ca
pacity of the large hall was taxed, and
even the big rostrum showed no space, for
! in addition to the officers of the day there
were the ladies of the McKenzie Musical -
Society. There was music, and plenty of
it, provided by Blum's orchestra and
band. At the first strains of "The Star
j Spangled Banner" President George R.
Fletcher motioned for the audience to
j arise, all standing in silence. As a fitting
1 conclusion the same piece was played,
j and by request the audience joined in the
: chorus with great feeling. As a whole,
It was a happy, patriotic occasion, which
will be long remembered.
Grand Marshal Stephen V. Costello
opened the exercises by introducing Presi
dent Fletcher, who after a few pleasant
remarks presented Mayor Phelan, stating
that this was the third occasion upon
which the gentleman had addressed the
people of the city on a national holiday
as the head of the municipal government.
Mayor Phelan was pleasantly greeted.
After complimenting the officers of the
day for the success with which they had
met, he said in part:
The sailing of the transports en May 25; IS9S.
was a momentous event In the history of the
United States. Out of the harbor of San Fran- i
A CHINESE ST. GEORGE AND HIS DRAGON.
ci=c<> went the troopships, carrying: the first ex- I
pedition Of armed forces evpr sent by the re- !
public to foreign lands <in a warlike mission.
The traditions of the pa*t were all opposed |
to it, but the exigencies of th" prevent Forced
a dej I'.rture from the established national pol- '
Icy. Ii is true that thÂ»> country li:id been warn- .
in by th<> founders if the republic against for- i
eiirn '"nnections and pciH.Tssiuns, aiul had lievn
i to make the growth of the country con
tinental, absorbing, if necessary, from time to
time, contiguous territory, but suddenly the
conditions changed and the conduct of the
country verified the old classic apothegm, i
"Time.-' change and we change with tlvm."
.Mr. Pridian spoke of the conditions ;
which brought about the war with Spain,
the destruction of the Maine the victories '
mi land and f-^a of Uncle Bam' a warrior*
jmk] tin part played in the terrific tragedy :
itinns by the patriots of this city.
When MÂ»Â»rton C. Allen, the orator of the i
day, was introduced to deliver the ora
tion he was welcomed by the most flat- 1
tering applause, for this native son is well j
and favorably known to the most of the |
people of this city, and the State, for that i
matter. He spoke of "the day we cele- !
lirate," the birtli of freedom, the fllg-ht of
years that has added preatness to the
nation and the patriotic devotion of Bev
enty millions of people to the flag that '
represents equal rights and the equality i
of all under its protecting folds and con
tinued:
I need not tell you, my fellow-citizene, that
the past year of our nation 1 * history has been I
made up of great events. It has been a year I
not only of blessings to the American people, !
but of momentous influence upon the thought
and governmental tendencies of all nations.
We have won great triumphs, but with them
have come to us new and serious responsibilities.
For the moment, however, we may be pardoned
an Indulgence In those feelings of pride and
gratification natural to the day and the occa
sion.
Weary Months oi War.
Weary months of war have cost us much In
blood and treasure. But the war, my fellow
oltlzena, has been worth far more than It has
cost. To the world It has been an object lesson
that can never be forgotten. New lessons have
been written upon the folds of the flat?, new
names added to the muster-roll of glory. Brave.
men have fallen, but the Maine has been
avenged, Spanish pride and arrogance has been
humbled, the Stars and Stripes float over Cuba,
Porto Rico and the Philippines, humanity Is
to succeed oppression in those fair Islands of
the sea. and. please God. where the American
flag floats to-day over new territory, purchased
at the cost of American lives end treasure,
there it shall float forever, the emblem abroad,
as at home, of human liberty, and the ceaseless
guardian of the rights of those Island races
who are destined through American valor to
know and to appreciate the inestimable bless
ings of free government.
1 need not tell you of the deeds of a Pewey,
a Sampson and a Sen ley, of a Shafter. a Wheel
er, a Miles, a Lawton and a Roosevelt. No
words of mine can a H to the fame of the sol
diers and sailors of the republic who have thus
laM down their lives In the most sacred war of
history,
In all these glorious achievements California
has played her part. The voice of the Golden
State has been heard in the guns of the Olym
pia and the matchless Oregon, sound ships.
built by sound money and manned by sound
men. The pomp and glory of martial display
are as familiar to our eyes as the eternal,
blue of heaven's canopy over our heads. From
our midst went forth the first regiment of
regular troops bound for the death-dealing
swamp of Cuba. Not less prompt were the gal
lant sons of our own soil in responding to the
Presidential call for volunteers.
California's Grand Part.
Hardly had the ink tlmÂ« to dry upon the
manifesto of our great commander before the
answer "Here!" rang down the line of Califor
nia's First Regiment, with gallant Colonel
Jim Smith at Its head. "For God and Coun
try" was their rallying cry, and deeply did It
touch the hearts of a great people.
With the American people the die is cast.
The Philippines must and will be retained. To
that sentiment the honor and faith of the na
tion are pledged, and, God willing, that pledge
will be kept. It Is the American people who
speak, anil by the side of that majestic voice
the criticism and Invective of a thousand Ed
ward Atkinsons will appear but as a whisper.
New occasions teach new duties; time makes
ancient jjood uncouth.
They must upward still and onward who would
keep abreast of truth.
With that sentiment aa our guide we may
face the unfolding years of the unknown future
without a fear. It will bring to us a remedy
tor every 111, while serving as a beacon light
of hope by which our ship of fate may steer (
to safe harbor. We have our problems at '
home and abroad, problems of labour and capi
tal, of men and of policy, but over us watches
with kindly eye the God of nations, and In our j
hearts we know that all Is well.
The New America.
Upon the future 1 cast the eye of faith -and !
hope. The new America is at hand, clad in all j
the. brightness of a Bummer's morning;. We \
face a gateway of promise, and as wealth, \
hitherto hidden from view, flashes in our faces, ,
we can hear the heartbeat of progress as upon :
the wings of heaven. There Is music In the
air. the music of the new and better dawn.
It is borne on the breath of the morning and
repeated in the -sighing breezes of the twilight.
The message is oil cheer, of gladness and of in
spiration. Our hearts are uplifted, and as we
stand with heads upraised, In the reverence
of the solemn hour, we salute â
A flag that hangs over my threshold, whose j
folds are more dear to me
Than the blood that thrills In my bosom Its â¢
earnest of liberty.
The concluding- remarks of the orator of ;
the day wore In tribute to the noble part
taken by the women of the nation in the !
late war and present troubles in the Phil
ippines and, he said, especially deserving- '
of reverence are the ladles of the Red !
Cross, who, as nurses In the fields of
battle and/providers for the soldiers at i
homo, have won the everlasting: gratitudes I
of citizen and warrior alike.

A DREAM OF EMPIRE.
The drooping banner drapes the staff.
No motion in the starry night,
Nor sound, except a distant laugh,
Where guard-matea wake before the
flght.
The soldier sleeps, his bosom bare,
His rifle at his fingers' tips;
Bend low among the bivouac there
And listen at the parted lips.
Faint syllables escape that tell
What fancies In his slumber thrive:
He reigns, a Hastings, splendid, fell.
He breathes the lordly name of Clive.
He rides the huddled tribesmen down,
And piles the red, Insatiate steel,
He takes the trench, he fires the town.
Nor halts till conquered foemen kneel.
Turn from the soldier, let him dream.
God shield him when he sleeps and
wakes :
Beyond the broad Pacific Stream
A statesman sits, as daylight breaks.
His couch, neglected, waits his head,
But ampler vision* fill his brain;
He sees a palace by the bed,
A world across the counterpane.
Lo, subject peoples bear him glfta
And serve upon his kingly state;
The equare Its myriad voice uplifts,
And halls him good as well as great.
The free man Is his brother's peer.
Neither a master nor a thrall,
And freedom Is not now and here,
But always, everywhere, for all: â

HIBERNIANS AT
SAN RAFAEL
A Crowd of Picnickers Listen
to Patriotic Addresses
at Schuetzen
Park-
Hibernians, ever patriotic, enthused with
the love of country, more with the love
of freedom, crowded Schuetzen Park yes
terday from the farthest glen to the
gates. Early in the day the first train
bearing Its load of pleasure seekers
stopped before the park gates, but the
big crowds awaited the passing of the pro
cession In the city before starting for the
picnic, planned and directed by the An
cient Order of Hibernians of America.
The early crowds went out "under the
trees and lunched and then joined in the j
games. Then they danced until along in
the afternon, when It was announced that
City and County Attorney Franklin K. >
Lane would deliver the day's oration.
Mr. Lane and Judge Cooney, who was
to Introduce the orator of the day, were
escorted to the stand by the band, which
rendered "The Wearing -of the Green." In
introducing Mr. Lane Judge Cooney first i
asked the attention of the crowd, and then
said that he, as well as his brothers, was
proud of the demonstration in sympathy
of the spirit which actuated the Ancient
Order of Hibernians fittingly to commem
orate Independence day. Â«83ai
"We are all nationalists," he said, "and :
not one of us here to-day but would fight ,
for Old Glory, and again, should the tide
of time so turn that the struggle would
avail, they would tramp in the line of bat
tle to free their mother country. Old Ire
land. In foreign lands to-day the Celtic |
soldier plods his way across the fields and I
stands shoulder to shoulder fighting splen
did battle with others who claim no al
legiance with any flag but the stars and
stripes, and with the ending of each day's
strife this Celtic soldier has taught a les- :
son to the rising generation of his bloodâ
the lesson that liberty to all is more pre
cious than life to the few. Though it
seems like oppression, this war in the
Orient is not. It is but a war to teach
the natives of the eastern isles the true
worth of liberty, when they know liberty |
under the direction of the Declaration of
Independence, as they will know it when
the insurrection is crushed."
When the applause had subsided Judge
Cooney Introduced Mr. Lane, who said:
Nine years ago I went to Virginia and looked
upon the tomb of the man who "rote the
Declaration of Independence. On the tomb ;
were engraved the simple words "Thomas
Jefferson, " than followed that he was the writer
of the one treat Instrument of liberty. I
would rather have those words engraved upon |
my tomb than to lie in that magnificent i
mausoleum of craven marble that hides the I
body of the great Napoleon or to rest beneath
the golden tombs of the Czars. AlthougTi
Thomas Jeffersi-n was the founder of a great
political party was known throughout his llfÂ»
in the world of diplomacy and state, Uiess
things have almost been forgotten In the mem
ory of the work of his pen. that work which
freed a nation and dmpied the fetters of op
pression from the net ks of 3.000,000 people.
Turning from this sti ry to the deeds of men,
you all know tLut the first men to take up
arms In the revolution, the war of freedom.
Â«Â»rv the sons of Ireland. The army under
Washington was Irish in the majority, as hayÂ«
been the armies that have fought this country'}
battles since and are lighting them now; an 4
one of the reasons that Ireland Is not now fre*
is that this country has drawn away its brain
aril brawn and insufficient men remain to
shoulder the great burden of suooasiful battle
against English oppression.
Again, on ar.other line. I want to fay that
I am an expansionist with liberty, and I glorf
In the results of our late war and thÂ« war of
th^ present, but with that of the present let
the spirit of freedom ever lead the troops and
let tliem gain strength that on the swinging
or their swords they are but bulldlnf a way
to plant the seeds of liberty as we have known
it ur.l;r the Declaration ">r Independence.
The crowd at the picnic -was the largest
of thÂ« season, fully 4000 people passing the
holiday at the park. This success was not
all flue to the day, either, the Individual
members of the committees being entitled
to most of the credit. The committee*
having the picnic in charge follow:

FIREWORKS DISPLAYS.
In the evening the pyrotechnic displays
attracted thousands of patriotic enthu
siasts, who* In spite of wind and fngr,
journeyed out to the various places se
lected by the Fourth of July Committee
for these exhibitions, and also to Glen
Pnrk, where the Federation of Mission
Improvement Clubs had arranged quite
an elaborate programme consisting of
fireworks in the open and dancing In the
free theater.
An overhead fog and a bracing west
wind were the accessories of the exhibi
tion In the vacant lot just east of the
Chutes. About 3000 people had gathered
to pee the Phow, and half of that number
hugged the leeward side of the Chutes
fence, for the breeze was cold that blew
from the salt sea.
There were rockets and bombshells ga
lore, but most of the brilliant meteoric
displays and showers of gold were in
visible in the midair tog, but such as es
caped the gloom ami were wafted gently
down into view were very pretty.
At Washington Park the crowd num
bered more than 5000 people.
Another big crowd assembled at the old
baseball grounds at the corner of Six
teenth and Folsom. There was no fog in
the Mission t interfere with their full
enjoym.nt i I pyrotechnics, and they
gazed in rapt admiration at the dazzling
lights which resulted from the bursting
of hundred of shells in midair until the
supply or lireworks had been completely
exhausted.
The 2000 people who went out to Glen
Park tscaped the fog also, but the air
was quite cool.

BAN RAF ABU July 4.â ThÂ© biggest
and moat successful Fourth of July cele
bration ever held In Marln County is a
thing of the past, and those actively con
cerned In making It what it was, especial
ly the Native Sons, are receiving congrat
ulations on all sides. Over 10,000 persons
â witnessed the various features of the cele
bration, and all united In the opinion that
the affair was worthy of any city In the
State.
At 10 o'clock occurred the grand street
parade. The precession formed on Fourth
and E streets, and. with Grand Marshal
Herzog at the head, passed down to Grand
avenue, thence to Palm avenue,, through
the Hotel Rafael grounds to Irwin street.
thence to Mission street, thence to De
Ileiry street, to Fifth street, to Bay View
and counter marched on B street to
Fourth and to the opera house, where the
review occurred.
Closely .-'.lowing the grand marshal and
his lids, of whom Lewis Hughes was
chief, came the float bearing- Miss Bertha
Kappenmann, the Goddess of Liberty and
Mips Florence Blumenthal. who filled the
role of Eureka. Next in the line of march
were the Veteran Firemen of San Fran
cisco, who were assisted In hauling their
time-honored engine by many fair maids.
There were four floats in all. That of the
Foresters represented Dewey's flagship, the
Olympial mounted on four stars symbol
izing Cuba. Porto Rico, Hawaii and the
Philippines*. The Knlehts of Pythias and
the Young: Men's Institute were repre
sented by floats. Three of these were de
signed by Charles Tidball.
One of the unique features of the pa
rade was a jinrikisha loaned by the Ti
voli Theater, drawn by a man dressed to
represent a Japanese, and bearing' Mar
guerite and Dorcas; the two little daugh
ters of \V. S. Dreypolcher. Tills novel ve
hicle was guyly decorated and on the back
support perched a huge stuffed eagle,
whose wings were outstretched protect
ingly over its tender charges. The deco
ration of the .: ik'.sha was. the work of
the children's mother and her creation
captured a prize.
Four bands took part in the march â the
Richardson's band of Sausalito, the St.
Vincent's Orphan Asylum band, the Vet
eran Firemen's band and the San Rafael
band. George 7 larding' s Darktown fire
brigade was wedged in between two of
them and afforded a deal of amusement
by spraying one another and the crowd.
About 2500 people participated in the
parade and it required thirty minutes to
pass a given point. The Native Sons
formed the largest single feature, the
Pausalito and Nicasio Parlors uniting with
San Rafael.
Immediately following the parade liter
ary and musical exercises were held in
the San Rafael Opera House, consisting
of an overture by Richardson's band;
opening remarks by Hon. F. M. Angel
lotti, president of the day; a vocal selec
tion, "The Star-Spangled Banner," by
Miss Rose Caesar; a patriotic oration by
Hon. Frank L. Coombs, and "America"
by the audience. Following these exer
cises the St. Vincent Orphan Asylum band
serenaded Miss Kappenmajin and Miss
Blumenthal at their homes. Miss Kap
panmann was serenaded in the evening
also by the Veteran Firemen's band.
At 1 p. m. a picnic and dance began at
San Rafael Park. Races and games for
prizes afforded entertainment to all who
attended.
Beginning at 8:30 o'clock In the evening
a magnificent pyrotechnic display was
given east of the broad gauge depot, un
der the supervision of W. S. Dreypolcher.
A representation of Old Glory and the
bear flag crossed, and one of Admiral
Dewey, caused an outburst of enthusiasm
that made the. hills echo and re-echo.
All th â¢ narrow gauge trains ran on Sun
day time, and a special broad guage train
at 10:30 p. m. took most of the visitors
back to Ban Francisco and Oakland. A
crowded special departed for Cazadero
and way stations on the narrow gauge at
10 o'clock.
QUIET AT LOS ANGELES.
LOS ANGELES, July 4.â ln contrast to
the patriotic fervor which one year ago
characterized the calibration of the
Fourth of July by the people of Los An
gH.-s, the public observance of the 123 d
Â»rsary of the independence of the
Vnited States to-day was of a most quiet
and unostentatious character. Trains to
the several beaches were crowded from
early in the morning until lato at night,
the Santa Monica trolley service currying
nearly 3000 passengers to the bicycle races
and other attractions at that resort.
There was no parade of the Seventh
Regiment, N. G. C, owing to the fact that
the several companies are an yet une
quipped. The city was generally dec
orated and Broadway and Spring street
are ablaze with flags and bunting. Many
business houses made elaborate displays
of the national col rs.
Exercises were held at Hazard's Pavil
ion, Captain I". J. Creasy being chairman.
This evening there was an elaborate dis
play of fireworks at West Lake Park.

i of the Capitol and making the air radiant

of entertainment offered.

BAKERSFIELD, July 4.â Much enthu
siasm was manifested here to-day at the

B, C. Smith was orator of the day. It was
to have a bear fight at Athletic
Park, but it did not take place. The ex
ise was made that the- officers would
not permit it, but many insist that it was
a scheme to attract people to the park
and get 50 cents admission, that it was
not intended to hay* the fight. This
feature of the celebration was unfavor
ably commented on both by the visitors
and townspeople.

STOCKTON, July 4.â Exuberant pa
triotism pervaded the city to-day, [t has
been many years since Stockton witnessed I
such a celebration of the national an
niversary. More flags were flung to the j
breeze, more bunting used and more pow- ,
clf-r burned than on any such occasion
within the memory of the younger gen
eration. The unanimous spirit with
which people of all classes united in the ;
ation was one of the most pleasant
and profitable lessons of the day.
The rising sun was greeted by the ring- :
ing of the church bells and the boom of
cannon. The morning hours were made i
lively by the gathering of the various or- :
ganizatfons which were to take part iv
the parade. The length of the proccs- i
sion and th<> rich spectacular features it .
possessed surprised the thousands who â 
gathered to watch it move through th.Â±
principal thoroughfares of the city.
Grand Marshal Koch succeeded in get- j
ting the various organizations in line and;
on the march shortly after 10 o'clock. The j
route was !â¢ -ngthy, but the cool day fa- !
vored the participants. The procession j
was composed of the various civic, mill-)
tary and fraternal societies of the city. |
A large number of floats typifying pa
triotlc subjects were furnished by the
committee and the lodges, clubs and as
sociations w< re represented In a similar i
manner. The military companies and the
exempt firemen, with the "old machine,"
made a nice showing.
The richest of all, however, was the :
oriental division, made up by the local j
Chinese. Th< Mongols carried the b*g- i
gest American flag in the procession at
the head of their divison, and the spec- ;
tacular .show which followed attracted
mor attention than any other. The local j
Mongols "spread themselves," and were
evidently pleased with the reception ac- !
corded them.
The literary exercises were held during
the afternoon at the Yosemite Theater.
The following was the excellent pro
gramme given:
"Stars and Stripes," Yosemite Thea

sands.
PACIFIC GKOVE'S DISPLAY.
The Day's Pleasure Marred by One
Serious Accident.
PACIFIC GROVE. July 4.â The nation's
birthday was celebrated at this resort
with much enthusiasm, visitors vying
with the townspeople in manifesting th-ir
patriotism. Everybody feemed to feel
that this Fourth, the last of the present
century, Is one of unusual significance
and unusual thoughtf ulness of the true
meaning of the anniversary was appar
ent on every side. The day's exercises
began with a parade and drill of the Pa
cific Grove brass band, little Winifred and
Gladys Tuttle, dressed as a gentleman
and lady of 177G, leading, carrying hand- i
some flags that .were almost as large as |
themselves. The band also gave a pa- !
triottc concert at the beach both morn
ing and evening on a stand erected at
the end of the long pier. An invitation j
tennis tournament, gentlemen's doubles, i
interested a large crowd during both
morning and afternoon, and a good base
ball game was played on the local dia
mond in the afternoon. Among the noted
tennis players of the tennis courts were
the Page brothers of Oakland, Dr. Seager
of San Francisco, Jones of Salinas Hugh
Rose of Denver, C 01.,; Harper brothers of
Pacific Grove and Osborne of Stanford.
The winners were Seager and Sobey.
The main demonstration of the day took
place at 8 p. m. in Assembly Hall, the
chief ovÂ«nt of which was a splendid ora
tion by the eminent California divine, Dr.
John A. B. Wilson of San Francisco. His
subject wes "Greater Amerk-a," and the
oration was delivered in the speaker's
most delightful style. After the address
the crowd repaired to the beach, where
a fleet of pleasure boats were illuminated
and a display of fireworks was made.
Fourth of July firecrackers caused an
accident which hns had serious conse
quences to F. W. Jackson of San Fran- j
cis.-o, a Stanford student whet is summer-
Ing here with his mother. Young Jackson
was coasting down the hill on Lighthouse
avenue on his wheel and at the same
time a buggy containing Miss Faulkner
and A. Galloway of Salinas was ascending !
;he hill. ' A bunch of firecrackers care- '
lessly thrown by a small boy on the
sidewalk terrified the horse and caused
him to jump violently to the opposite side
of the street, throwing the buggy directly
in the path of the wheelman. Jackson
wj>s too close to the buggy to turn aside !
when the horse shied and crashed into the '
vehicle. His handle bar caught in the :
front wheel of the bu^gy and he was |
thrown off. striking on his head and sus- |
tainlng a bad scaip wound and a com- i
pound fracture of the right clavicle. A
surgeon was immediately summoned and

ONWENTSIA GOLF CLUB GROUND,
LAKE FOREST, 111., July To-day's j
play in the golf tournament was remark- ;
able for the quality of golf put up under
adverse circumstances. The grounds were j
in poor condition from the soaking rains
of last night, which continued at Intervals ;
dining the morning, notwithstanding some j
extremely low scores were made, and dur- i
ing the afternoon, when the west wind ;
had partly dried up the course, golf of ;
a sensational character was played by ,
some of the contestants.
To Walter Fairbanks of the Overland :
Park Golf Club of Denver and a veteran
of the St. Andrews Club of Scotland, and
J F. Curtis of the Essex County Golf Club
of Boston belong the honor of one of the ,
most remarkable scores ever made in a i
trolf tournament. The two golfers played i
forty holes before their struggle was end
ed with one up in favor of Mr. Fairbanks. |
They were all square at the eighteenth i
and thirty-sixth holes. Then for - four I
the two struggled: halving the thirty-sex
enth thirty- Ighth and thirty-ninth holes, :
â  ir. six, tour and seven respectively, the ;
I Westerner finally winning the fortieth in l
four, amid enthusiastic applause of the ;
gallery of 700. Mr. Fairbanks will play H. j
P. Toler to-morrow.
One of the surprises of the day was the ,
decisive defeat of William McCawley of |
the Merlon Cricket Club, Philadelphia, at ,
the hands of William Holaberd Jr. of the ,
Glen View Club. Chicago, a 16-year-old
boy The result of to-day's play was de- ]
cidedly in -favor of the East against the I
West " eleven of to-day's winning players i
coming from Eastern clubs, while only
live, Including Mr. Fairbanks of Denver,
are from the West.' Of these five, C. B.
McDonald and V. H. Smith, the latter;
the runner up in last year's tournament
over the Morris County golf course, are
looked upon as having the best chance
to win the championship.
Notwithstanding the intensely disagree
able weather, a holiday crowd was pres
ent in the afternoon, and the playing took
on the appearance of a society function. j
Hundreds of women were present and
they refused to seek the shelter of the :
clubhouse veranda during the rain, but
followed their favorite players around the
course Holaberd. Douglas, Reid Jr.. For
gan and others had large galleries am
the course a.- the players fought their
way over the links presented a decidedly
animated appearance. â¢

Mesmerist Captures the Second Half
of the Double Event and Dr.

Steeplechase.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. July 4.â This was get
away day at Sheepshead Bay, and the [
crowd at the track was bigger than any
other since the Suburban, at least 20,000
people being present, most of them
drawn by the rich Realization stakes tor
three-year-olds at a mile and live fur
longs. All the good three-year-old colts;
with the exception of Filigrane and Jean
Bereaud. were eligible, and out of these
tlve elected to go to the post, with Ethel
bert a pronounced favorite.
In the first break Half-Time stumbled,
threw his jockey and ran a mile at top
speed before he was caught. After some
delay they were sent out again, and this
time the flag fell with Filon dOr in front,
Ethelbert next and The Bouncer third.
As they came sailing down the stretch
the jockeys were lying low on their
horses' necks, for the wind was blowing
a gale up the track and their speed was
greatly retarded thereby. As they passed
the grand stand half a mile of the dis
tance had been run in :50 2-5, and Filon
dOr was half a length in front of Ethel
bert. he a length in front of The
Bouncer, and all going well in spite of
the half-gale that was impeding them.
They reached the five furlong mark in
1:03 3-5, and then for a short time the
wind was behfnd them and Spencer took
a good hold of Ethelbert, letting the wind
help him as it would, although he saw
that he got a length the best of Filon
dOr as they rounded the lower turn. Un
der the wind and as they straightened
out for the run under all canvas the boys
on Lothario and Filon dOr foolishly tried
to catch Ethelbert, instead of saving
their strength for the final rush through
[the stretch. As they came up to the
upper turn, which marked the end of the
mile 1:44 1-5 had been clicked off on the
watch of the timer, and Etheibert, under
wraps, was still a length to the good.
Next came Filon dOr, two lengths in
front of The Bouncer, both being urged
a bit by their riders, while Lothario was
fourthjfand ..â¢"-Time, hopelessly eaten,
in last place.
The mile and a Quarter on the upper
turn and the last bit f of the race with
lair wind was reached in 2:10 by Lthel
bert but Spencer had concluded that it
was tim- for him to clinch the rac<^ and
he loosened his horse's head and leu the
others as if they were standing still. The
speed was not great ' hen, but the ground
covered had been long and the wind wa3
no less than it hail been. With but a
quarter of a mile to go; the lot came into
the stretch. Ethelbert gaining with every
jump. A furlong from home he was .i
half-dozen lengths in the lead, and in
spite: of the fact that Spencer took a
steadying pull on him he won by a dor.en
lengths, while Lothario got the place
by a couple of lengths.
From a spectacular point of view, the
Independence steeplechase was the best.
It was over the long course, and Dr. Cat
lett was the favorite, with Peconi-j a
strong second choice. At the fall of the
flag. Peconic went out at once, attended
by Dr. Catlett and Wigtown, and they
ran that way until they had passed the.
grand stand the second time, and weru on
the last lap of their Journey. Then Fin
nigan sent Dr. Catlett after the leader,
and â¢i.igan followed suit with Westown.
It was all Peoonio wanted, for he stopped
at on"cc and finished the race in the rear
of the procession.
It was a pretty contest from this time
out between the favorite and Westown,
and it looked as if they would have the
race to themselves until the last jump
had been . Mated. Then Harry Smith
set loose King T at them, and, while h<?
could not pass Dr. Catlett, he man.it:",]
to snatch second place away from
â \Vestown.
The other stake on the card was the
second half of the Double Event, with
Prince of Melbourne, winner of the ;irst
half, coupled with Radford, as the
favorite. The Bromley pair. Mesmerist
and Irorjuois Belle, were well backed
second choice?. The start was made
promptly. and Mesmerist was in front
from end to end. winning with a trifle to
spare, whil* Mark Cheek got the place.

pany â Guy Vernon Downed
Athavis.
Devotees of harness horse sport found
sion from the exploding
bomb and noisy "red head" at Oakland
tra.k yesterday. The racing was con
: under the auspices of the Golden
Turk Driving Association, and was
SS , ,\ D j â  â¢ â  â¢â â â pie. A lengthy
programme of six events was decided, and
ls sundown, and long past, ere the
crowd left for this side. The card could
been shortened and the rules much
more clearly interpreted.
The sport wore :i clean look from the
t, the finishes of the different heats
being highly invigorating. Johnny Hum
phreys and Harry Corbett attended to the
wants of all of a speculative turn of mind,
and Johnny remarked "they about held
their own." It could be said that four j
legitimate favorites won. in Harvey B,
Catlnka, King Cadenza and Guy Vernon. j
The opening event for "green 'uns" saw |
erx line up tor the word, with A. B. P.
driven by Patrick, a sizzling hot choice.
After finishing sixth, then fourth, Lady
FalroÃe, with H. Miller at the helm,
stepped off two winning heats without a |
"jimmy."
A big thing was to have come off In the ;
2:30 class affair, but it has now been !
postponed. Dr. Leek journeyed to far
away Petaluma, returning with the mare
Dentina to "fool the boys." Ruling fa
vorite for the first heat, she collided with
her pedigree before the stretch was reach
ed, finishing sixth, despite the doctor's
liberal use of the scraper.' Consistent as
ever in the next two he, its she again fin
ished sixth at each essay. Ethel H. the â¢
long shot of the day. a 6 to 1 shot, sallied
to victory in the third and fourth heats, â 
well handled by L.. Richardson. Fair
mount Prince and Alfred H each" secured
a heat, but failed to stay the route.
The race for the O'Kane challenge cup
furnished no contest whatever. Harvey
B secured the two necessary heats with
out a struggle, with Admiral Dewey sec
ond at each trial. Prince Howard, the
only other contender, was distanced the |
first heat. â 
King Cadenza, over which H. Dunlap
held the reins, made the other five entries
in the 2:20 class look cheap. Nicely rated,
the son of Steinway stepped off two very
pleasant heats in 2:25%; 2:20%. On each
occasion he was followed out by Prince ,
c. The winner was a pronounced choice
In the betting.
Perhaps to Mr. Brod's good driving, pos
sibly to the bad handling of Athavis -by
Mr Drury Guy Vernon, the favorite, cap
tured the" butchers' race. Vernon won the
opening heat in 2:30. Athavis then came
out and put bis foot down in 2:24 ,-2, leav
ing Guv back in the dust. or the third
and deciding heat Athavis ruled a con
scientious sort of a favorite, but possibly
lacked condition. Just before the stretch
was reached he stepped on some tacks,
and Mr. Brod and his gray were the he
roes of the afterpiece.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 5, 1899.
GEORGE WHITNEY
IS A PEERLESS
TENNIS PLAYER
Defeats Champion
Sumner Hardy.
MOST BRILLIANT CONTEST
GREAT ENTHUSIASM AT THE
CLOSING MATCH.
Pacific States Lawn Tennis Associa
tion Tournament at San Rafael
a Complete Success in
Every Respect.
The Pacific States Lawn Tennis Cham
pionship Tournament at San Rafael is
over and George Whitney Is the hero of
thf hour. His second and final battle for
supreme racket honors was fought out
yesterday and ho is now invested with all
the rights and honors that go with the
tennis championship of the coast. Sum
rier Hardy felt his strong- right arm yes
terday afternoon and was placed hors dv
combat after the most brilliant single
match of the throe days' contests.
It can hardly be said that fceorge Whit
ney's playing was equal to that of Mon-
Caugbt Round the Tennis Net at San Rafael.
day, when he defeated Sam Hardy in
: three straight sets; yet for this very rea
l eon the match was m^re exeitinp. Sum-
m er Hardy won the first set. This aujf
tnented the doubt as to the outcome.
When the second set was four all and
Hardy showed a speed that was amazing,
! things looked blue in the California Club
camp and Oakland rejoiced to the full.
j Had this set become the property of
: Hardy Oakland money would have k> ac
| around the courts begging for an accep
tance. Hut sÂ»uch was not to be. The
local man won the next two pm=s and
the two Beta following, dealing a double
death blow to the- Hardy family.
The first game of the contest went to
Hardy. He took a lesson from his
: brother's defeat, profiting by a close at
tention to Whitney's style of play in this
match He knew as well as anybody that
if he were to lay low the winner of the
All-Comers, he must play a daring, auda
cious and risky game. This he did, and
his playing was full "f brilliance ana
dash. He passed Whitney again- and
again by the most perfect back-hand
drives, accepting chances that seemed
â  futile. There was a strong contrast be
tween Whitney's cautious, careful and
persistent work and Hardy's reckless and
successful exhibition. Perhaps no more
brilliant tennis has ever been. Been i:i
California.
At the end of the second set when the
score read a set for each contestant, six
games to tour, both Whitney and Hardy
felt confident of ultimate victory. Not so
with the bottle-holders and seconds. Rob
ert N. Whitney and Sam Hardy each
sweating over the body of his brother.
On the back lines they swore to them
| PP ]vesâ and smiled alternately as the for
tune, of the battle changed. As Joe Daily
shouted the result of each score in the
i third set as It went creeping up for Whit
i new until he had five straight games,
"Brother" Bob was getting rid of a
i pocketful of cigars and â¢â¢Brother" Sam
was thinking of funerals. Sumner won
1 the sixth game which was his sole por
' tlon in the third set. The California ron
i tlngent sang 'Must One Game" and the
young lady friends of the Oakland man
stamped petulantly.
This was really the end of the contest,
though another "set had to be played.
Hardy was weakening, losing confidence
In himself and failing to Bcore by his bold
1 chances Whitney steadily improved his
game which was of the championship
order. The first game of the final set was
Hardy's and then the local asphalt king
: captured six straight without the wink-
Ing of an eye. The championship match
of 1899 was completed and congratulations
' followed. Whitney is the winner of two
1 cups one for the all-comers and the other
for the championship victory.
The score of the match yesterday was
4 â 6 G_4 6 â l, 6âl.
In the morning a consolation doubles
was played Very little interest was taken
in this affair, the spectators being .satis
fied with a nier- knowledge of results. The
i scores of this tournament are: Bradshaw

CANDELARIA
CAPTURED THE

â Â« â
GOOD COURSES AT UNION PARK
TOD SLOAN BEAT FOR GLORY AT
10 TO 1.
Wait-a-Little Ran an "Undecided".
Wit Crawford Lad, but the Lat
ter Failed to Score in
the Run-Off.
There were fifty-six entries in the Re
serve stake, for all-age greyhounds, at
"Union Coursing Park yesterday. The tlnal
was won by J. Seggerson's Candelaria In
a pretty and close course with Russell,
Allen <& Wilson's Daisy Claire. The lat
ter was favorite at odds of 1 to 2. Can
delaria l<-il and held the hare for a few
turns, afn-r which there were a few ex
changes and Daisy had somewhat the best
of the last part, but Candelaria killed and
won the Btake.
It was an "on and off" day for betting,
both long shots and favorites having their
1 inning's. In the second round Tod Sloan
beat For Glory at 10 to 1 after running
two undecided courses in the first. This 1
was a surprise, as For Glory led and
looked a winner in the beginning, but Tod
outworked his opponent at all points to
ward the end of the game. The next best
short end, to win at 4 to 1, was Maid of
Erin, who worked very cleverly after St.
Anthony led to the hare.
Daisy Claire ran strong and conscien
tiously and was lucky in her first two
courses in not being pitted against crack
dogs, though when she did get high class
dogs she did very well and snowed herself
a true sister to lior-ie Claire, who won the
consolation stake last Sunday. Candelaria
went through the stake by hardly win
ning every course, though he easily beat
Forgive, who is regarded as a "lurcher."
Altogether it was a .splendid day's cours
ing. The hares ran strong, and though
many of the courses were long they were
not gruelling. In the third round Wait a
Little and Crawford Lad ran an "unde
cided." The former got the best of the
slip, led for several lengths, caught the
hare and fell. Crawford Lad got a turn
and Wait a Little made two wrenches and
a kill. In the run-off the Lad never
scored.

DENTISTS WIN
A GREAT TEN
INNING GAME
Dunlevy's Sensational
but Costly Catch.
LETS IN THE WINNING RUN
OAKLAND DEFEATED IN A MOST
PECULIAR MANNER.
Andrews and Steffani Both Pitch
Winning Ball â Some Fine
Fielding by Each
Team.
By making a sensational catch of a
foul fly Dunlevy lost a ten-inning game
for Oakland yesterday afternoon that was
as full of pyrotechnics as any well regu
lated Fourth of July celebration could
boast of. No blame can be attached to
Dunlevy, however, for he had played a
marvelous fielding game throughout, ac
cepting eight chances without an error,
three of them being long foul flies that
he took from off the fence In front of the
left field bleachers.
The peculiar condition whereby he last
the game by making a put-out occurred
in the tenth inning. Graham had opened
with a double and went to third when
Steffani suddenly snapped the ball to sec
ond to catch him napping. The bag was
uncovered and the ball rolled out to cen
ter. After Anderson had been assisted out
at first by Steffani Dairymple sent up a
high fly to left that looked at, the start as
though it would fall in fair territory. Dun
levy started after the bail, which was
carried outside the foul line by the wind.
The iielder, who was looking up at the
ball, could not see that it was foul, and
by a great sprint hi- managed to get under
and hold It. Graham was ready at third,
and as soon as the ball landed in Dun
levy's hands he started home and scored
what proved to 'be the winning run. Had
Dunlevy not caught it Graham would
have been held at third.
Oakland came dangerously close to
si oring in its half, for with one man gone
the bases were tilled, but a great double
play ended the trouble.
With the exception of Schmeer, who
had an off day and piled up three bungles,
the Qelding on both Bides was exception
ally brilliant. Leake for the Dentists and
Dunlevy for the Dudes carrying off the
honors. Andrews was in in. box for the
visitors and again demonstrated that with
Donlin out oi it he is the fastest pitcher
in the league. For nine innings Oakland
banged away with the nei result of one
homesick swat. In the t>-nth they picked
up two more, but they were not fruitful
ot runs.
StetTani, Oakland's new twlrler, also
pitched a fine game, seven hits being the
>urn total dt San Jose's stick work. Bar
ring a tendency to waste time beforv de
livi ring the bail he made a most favorable
impression on the cranks. Nothing
sei in. d to rattle him, not even the coach-
Ing of Dalrymple and oDea, and twice
when San J.^s.- opened up with doubles h-j
r-tir.-d the side without a run. Unfor
tunately he forced in the first run for the
visitors' by a base on balls, but that Â«as
liis only evidence of fllgntlness. Steffani
gives promise of fooling: the hardest hit
ting ti^ims in the league. He is a .S.ui
Jose boy, but will make his hnm>- in
Oakland and devote his time to the game.
bevy had several close decisions to
make and acquitted himself creditably,
though once or twice the crowd thought
he was off, but in every instance hit de
cision was in accordance with the rules.
San Jose scored its first run in the sec
ond, when Hanlon made the circuit
on singles by himself and ODea, an error
by Ford, which tilled the bases, and a pass
to Leake, forcing Hanlon home. ; ,
Oakland tied it up in the fourth. Peeples
led off with a single and was sacrificed to
second by * Hammond. Hardie flew to
Graham and Peeples started for third.
Graham tried to head him off, but Iho
ball got away from ODea and Pet-pies
kept on home.
From that time until the tenth, when
Dunlevy's catch cost a tally, there was
not a sign of a run. In Oakland's half of
the last inning, with one man ou|, Lang"
and Schmeer singled. Donovan hit 'to
Leake. who tried for Schmeer at second,
but the kid beat the ball and the bases
were full. Ford followed with another
smash that nearly upset Leake when he
stopped it, hut he handled It nicely, forc
ing Donovan at second, and Andorson,
who made the putout. sent the ball to first
a^ead of Ford, terminating as nice, clean
a game as has been played here yet.

A SLfiVEriOLDING REACTION.
A. i iRRESPONDENT of the New York
ie, writing from Los Angeles about the
jugation of the Filipinos, says: "Nothing
ices to their senses more quickly than
force properly and paternally applied. It
is precisely the effect of judicious - i J punish
â  on the wayward and precocious youth, of which
he retains the lively recollection for the term of his
natural life."
That was the argument made by Parson Brown
in favor of enslaving the African race and I
stern discipline under bondage. General Lee. the his
:i of the Confederate veterans, in his report at
Charleston welcomed imperialism because it would
bring the race problem home to the whole country
and aid the intentions ' entertained by the South
toward the negro. It is a startling reflection that the
sentiment which led to the abolition of slavery has
â¢ peared, the spirit has evaporated. Lincoln
â¢ i that cause in the name of the Declaration of
pendence, stood for' the equal rights of man and
sternly faced the responsibility of civil war for the
sake of one Union and one law for all under its juris
diction. To-day the Declaration of Indepen
dence is read at all meetings to celebrate the an
niversary of our independence, but what orator will
take his stand upon it as the vital principle of our
government as Lincoln did?
The fact is that there is a reaction against freedom,
against <c] ; government, against government by the
consent of the governed. Unfortunately the leader
ship in this reaction is found in the United Si
One of it? effects is obviously a revival of the la?h
for the ownership of man by man. Chattelry in
human flesh ha? ceased to excite aversion. Next to
owning subjects by a nation comes naturally the
ownership of slaves by individuals. A work has been
written by an P'ncrlish clergyman called "The Missing
Link," wl - â  I'lely circulated in this coun
try md 'he British colonies by the imperialists in
both countries. It is an argument for the reduction
of the dark races to servitude, with the white races as
their â¢ national and personal. It is an in
'â¢inion to the literature of imperialism
It tr rses ;e same ground as "The South Side
View of Slavery," Brownlow's vindication of chat
tels and the transactions of the Pro-Slavery Society
of South Carolina. It is a sort of literature that was
obsoleted in this country when the constitution was
amended to forbid slavery and involuntary servitude
in the United States and all places within their juris
diction.
British imperialism stands confessed as a policy ;in
ken for commercial purposes. Prior to 1X24 it
paid, beiau-e negro slavery, with trade, "followed the
flag." When slavery was abolished and it was the
1 of the British conscience that shackles fell from
a slave when his foot touched the soil of the em
pire, the profits of imperialism declined. It is a
policy that pays only when men can be forced to
work in tropical heat and humidity.
We are entering upon imperialism at the dictation j
of greed. Colonel Denby, whose view 9 were
cially adopted when he was sent to the Philip:
after their expression, said: "We take the Philippines
not for the good of their people, but for nur own ;
fit Tf it won't pay us to take them, we don't want
The syndicates and combines which have
I this country into imperialism, for their own
t, are wise in their generation. They want to
make it pay them, and to get a profit which they will
lead the people to think is for the nation they must
own labor and coin its sweat under the lash.
England and the United States, allied to subjugate
the black man, joining in a hypocritical snivel about
the "white man's burden," whicli consists in making
a black man do his work, and whipping him for re
fusing, are led to the practical restoration of slavery.
It is quite startling that when men in the military
service spat on the constitution and condemned it
as unworthy of discussion, .md the pulpit denounced
the Declaration of Independence as "a damnable lie,"
instantly all the furies of human greed and selfishness
were let loose and the man-hunter and slave-catcher
was not ashamed to bawl the righteousness of his
calling.
W. K. Vanderbilt wants to be a king, even if he
becomes only a monarch of railroads. There is a
kingship to rent in Samoa; he might bid for that
THE CUBfIN-AMERICANS.
I
IN our political campaigns we hear of all kinds of
â¢Americans, except just plain Americans. No one
thinks of nominating a candidate to catch their
: ! votes, and" we hear no flattery of them in stump
I speeches. To the hyphenated Americans from the
: four corners of the earth there has lately been added j
: a new field from the fifth corner, and the new hyphen-
T T *
i nted mongrel is catted a Cuban-American. He is a
â  man who wants to get all the joint advantages of
I American markets and prices, and the cheap labor
| and tropical productions of Cuba. He is a man with- J
i out a country or a pedigree, a professional parasite, j
whose God is a dollar, and whose business it is to I
embroil nations to make trade out of the blood of j
their people. The parasite prates a deal of patriotism j ;
; and has the art of making people believe that the i ,
blood and tears they shed and the moneys they waste j ,
' in needless wars for his benefit are sacrifices made for
their country and mankind. Men of this class have i
organized a Cuban-American League, with head- j
quarters in New York. Its officers are William â 
O. McDowell, president; Charles W. Butler, treas- j
urer; Antonio A. Aguirre, secretary; Dr. Leon Bou- j
land, director of the educational department. Here
. we have an Irishman, a Scotchman, a Spaniard and
: a Frenchman running Cuban- American affairs and J
"educating" the American people to break the word j
| and promise and pledge of the nation by annexing j
| Cub*.
j These men have begun dictating American policy in j
' a fashion if possible more insolent than that of Great i
Britain: On Tune 2 they sent to the President of the j
j United States this insolent letter:
"The Cuban-American League desires to enter its I
most earnest protest against the continuing of the
tariff barrier and foreign rates of postage between the i
United States and Porto Rico, the Philippines and j
I Cuba. So far as Porto Rico and the Philippines are ,
I concerned they are as much a part of the United
States as Alaska or any of the Territories, and we be- i
lieve their continued treatment in the matter of tariff i
and postage as if they were foreign countries is con
trary not only to the letter and spirit of the consti
tution of the United States, but to the best interests
of the nation, and so far as Cuba is concerned we
recognize it is destiny that she should become and
continue a permanent part of the United States, and |
' in order that any of her deluded people that try to ;
oppose or delay this consummation may benefit from
! the educating experience resulting from free trade
with this nation, we urge that so long as she shall
remain under the flag of the United States every I
i courtesy existing between the States of this union
be extended to â that is, free trade and national ;
postage rates. The Cuban-American League recog
i nizes that such a policy will attach her people and her
'. interests to this nation with ties as strong as those |
which bind California, Louisiana, Illinois and New
1 York to their sister States."
If this letter is insolent, the answer is extraordin- !
! ary. The making of tariffs and postal rates is a civil :
' function ot Congress. That body and that alone, un- !
' ! der the constitution, can change, suspend or extend
; them. The Cuban-American letter was answered by j ]
I an Assistant Secretary of War, who said:
1 j "In reply I beg to inform you that the subjects re- > '
| ferred to in your letter are now receiving the earnest j
. ] attention of administrative authorities, especially that j
of the military branch of the public service. The , 1
*. { j
statements made in your letter will be duly weighed j '
1 in connection with an equitable adjustment of the .
important questions."
The "military branch" is considering whether it j
will set aside the laws of Congress and decree free â¢
trade with Cuba! The "military branch" is contem- ;
! plating the extension of American postage to foreign I
: soil, which Congress has solemnly declared shall not I
:be made a part of our territory! If the "military i
: branch" doesn't see what it wants will it please ask â¢
for it?
These things, which it is reported by the Assistant
Secretary of War to have under "earnest considera- j (
tion," are none of its business. To make them so is I
:to be guilty of the boldest usurpation. If the Re- ' i
: publican party propose to identify itself with such '
J declarations and such doctrines it is time to look for '
I new leaders who respect the constitution and believe ' *
1 in free government.
i
The "military branch" is spoken of as if it were I â¢
one of the co-ordinate branches of the Government, j i
when the men who made the constitution regarded a .
military establishment as an evil justified only by nn- t
cessity. . ! t
Surely we are going the pace that kills republics if
| this branch is guilty of even debating its power and '
j right to nullify the laws of the country.
Tobacco and sugar, two prime industries of this .
i country, which are of such importance to our farmers I <
|as to require their protection by a tariff enacted by t
â â  Congress, arc to be ruined by the insolent demand of !
: this Cuban-American League, and if the army weigh '
I. that league against the American farmers and find ;
â  them wanting there will come a Congress in which I
i the army will be stripped of its power and its arro- ! â 
| gance will be humbled. t
EXPEL THE "GRAFTER."
WHEN the Republican Central Committee ;
hnids its meeting on Friday it should proceed
promptly and summarily to the expulsion from
its membership of J. M. Chretien. There is no need
tor <; [of the purpose of investigation. His
record on the Fourth of July Committee has been
made public, and his dismissal from that body has re
ceived popular approval. There will be approval also
for his instant dismissal from the Republican com
mittee.
The issue is one that cannot be avoided. It is now I
a matter of general knowledge that Chretien, while
serving on the Fourth of July Committee, sought to
tin is that patriotic festival into a means of enriching
himself. The evidence of his attempt to "graft" was |
sufficiently convincing to lead to his expulsion from
the committee, and with that fact strongly impressed
upon the minds of the people it will never do to in- 1
trust him with any authority whatever in the manage- j
ment of the Republican campaign.
The American people are tolerant of many things, |
but they will not tolerate a man who turns popular
patriotism into a matter of personal profit and plays j
a confidence game upon the ardent loyalty of the
public. Such a man they will always regard with sus
picion, and any political party which intrusts him with
authority in its management is certain to lose to a
considerable extent the confidence of the masses.
The Republican committee owe 3it to the party to j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 5, 1899.
dismiss Chretien from its membership. The men
who are intrusted with the duty of preparing for the i
campaign, handling the party funds and providing a
means by which every Republican shall have an equal
vote at the primaries, must be men who are above
suspicion of "grafting" or making any undue use of
their authority. It is not enough that a majority are
free from suspicion. All must be so. Chretien
must go.
AGRICULTURAL SCIENTISTS.
f~* ALIFORNIA has a cordial welcome for the
( members of the Association of American Agri-
cultural Colleges and Experiment Stations who
have come from their distant homes to attend the
convention which assembles in this city to-day. San
Francises is Fortunate in having the privilege of ex
tending that welcome. A very large proportion of
our citizens own farms or orchards and are interested
in the work in which the visitors are engaged, and will
receive them, therefore, as fellow-workers as well as
distinguished guests.
No State in the Union, and possibly no similar area
of country in the world, can be more interesting to
agricultural experts and, experimenters than Califor-
The whole rural industry of the State is to a
considerable extent an experiment on a grand scale,
with thousands of intelligent, progressive men work-;
ing along varying lines for the accomplishment of
new fesults in vineyards, orchards and fields. In al
most every comity in the State the observant stu- *
dent of scientific agriculture can find something of j
more than ordinary interest and value, because in
every county there arc many men who have long been
experimenting with more or less scientific exactness
in developing rural industries.
As the convention is composed of men who arÂ« ex- :
perts in agricultural matters and are competent to
judge and estimate the value of what they see, it will j
be gratifying to show them as much of California as
they will have time to visit. When to them we have
made known the great and varied resources of the
State we shall have authorities to speak for us in all
parts of the Union. Their visit to California will,
therefore, prove to be one of mutual benefit as well as
of mutual pleasure, and the welcome they receive in
this city will be repeated and renewed at every place
where they may go to examine the resources of our
golden land.
STUDENT FEES AT STANFORD.
A CORRESPONDENT, whose letter we pub- j
lish in another column, commends the course!
of The Call in opposing the imposition of a
registration fee upon the students of the State Uni- \
versity, and expresses a hope that an equally strong
effort will be made to bring about a repeal of the tax
imposed upon students at Stanford.
The letter is inten sting from the revelation it makes
â  â  . â¢â¢â¢â¢ â on given by the public to matters of
higher education at our two great universities, and
â  at both of them education
Id be free. For thai reason it is published as an
expression of the voi< c of the people. It will be im
ble, however, for The- Call to oppose the Stan
ford fee system as it did the purpose to impose one
at Berkeley. The conditions of the two institutions 1
are so different that what would have been a wrong
in the one case is perfectly justifiable in the other.
State University is a part of our system of
public education It was founded by the people for
the instruction of the youth of the State and is main
tained by taxation imposed upon the property of all.
The manner of its government f-'id administration is,
therefore, a matter of public concern and is subject to
public criticism just as that of any other State institu- j
tion. The imposition of the suggested registration
fee upon students at a university so established would*
have been wrong, inasmuch as it would have shut out!
from the advantages of the institution the children of i
some of the people who are taxed to maintain it. It
would have defeated the very aim for which the uni
versity was founded â that of making education free.
Stanford University occupies a very different posi- i
tion from that of the State University. It was not
founded by the people, nor is it maintained by them
It is a private institution founded and endowed to
perpetuate the memory of the family of the founder
The trustees may, therefore, conduct it in any manner
they choose so long as they do not violate the terms
under which the trust was created or those of the
charter granted by the State. The trustees have as '
much right to impose a tuition fee upon students of
the university as they have to limit the number of ;
women who will be admitted to it.
It is well known to be the desire of Mrs. Stanford
to provide education at the university as freely as pos
sible, and there can be no good reason for doubting .
that the trustees will co-operate with her to that end.
In time education may be untaxed there as at Berke
ley. The issue, however, is one for Mrs. Stanford
and the trustees to deal with. As the public is not]
taxed to sustain the university it has no right to dic
tate how it shall be conducted.
In view of the riots, threatened strikes and general
disorder in his monarchy, the King of Belgium is
thinking of appealing to the country. If his affairs
grow much worse he will probably discuss seriously
the expediency of taking to the woods rather than
talking to the country.
Tt appears that the day of the dog has passed in
Berkeley. The poisoner is abroad in the land and
aristocratic dames are guarding aristocratic canines
with a vigila*nce worthy of a better cause. The ladies
insist that in Berkeley at least everything shall not go
to the dogs.
It is all in the point of view. Recent dispatches
from the Philippines dilate glowingly upon the vir
tues of a 'Filipino patriot who was shot to death by
the Spanish authorities. And the American forces
are. hot after that conscienceless rebel and military
outlaw, Aguinaldo.
The Samoan people seem to be laboring tinder a
political disadvantage that is without historical par
allel. They have two kings and want neither, but
seem destined to be oppressed by both.
The qualification?, for enlistment in the American
army are being materially modified. Recruits are
asked now only to be sufficiently educated to point
the muzzle of a gun in the right direction.
When C. P. Huntington hears of the assessment of
the Market Street Railway Company he may try to
move the road out of the State. The sad news should
be broken to him gently.
Commercial agencies report that money is cheaper
in London. On this side, however, it has not been
noticed that $10 bills are being marked down to $6 99.
King Humbert of Italy may be tottering on his
throne, but he appears to have left a jail or two in
which to incarcerate fractious statesmen.

to lay its wires underground â even those to Sacra

William Harry, a boy 17 years of age.
whose parents keep ;i bakery and con
fectionery at 323 Hyde street, was held
up and robbed of all the money he had
on Leavenworth Btre<t. between Califor
nia and Pine streets, aboul :< o'clock Mon
day night. He wan also struck on the
head with some instrument which caused
an ugly wound "ii his scalp.
The boy, for fear of unnecessarily
alarming his parents, went to bed after
he got home wi Ing them of his
experience, but yesterday morning:, when
his mother observed the clotted Mood on
his head, she asked for an explanation
and took him to the Receiving Hospital,
where the wound was stitched and
dressed. If the Mow had been an inch
lower it might Dave killed the hoy.
"I was on my way home," he said, "and
when Walking between California and
Pine streets on Leavenworth 1 passed
four young men who were lounging
against the wall of a house. J walked
past them and they came running after
me. "When they got up to me I was
struck on the head with some instrument
and the blow dazed me for a moment.
Two of thc-in grabbed me and another
one went tnrougb my pockets, taking
$1 25, all the money I had, and a valuable
knife. It was dark at the place where
they held me up and I d^n't know if 1

done so quickly. After they had robbed
me they ran away. I did not call fur

attack."
The police wera notified and every ef

STUDENT FEES AT STANFORD.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 3, 1899.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: I hope you will,
by ringing editorials and otherwise, bring
about in Stanford University that which
has just been achieved by the R^g^nis of
the stale University, in removing the
odious $20 tax. Stanford University coir
!â¢ cts each year from- each and all of her
students $20, and this, as every one knows,
is in many instances a great hardship.
There Is no longer any reason why this
should be don . Stanford claims to be
and dc.ul.tK-ss is the richest university in
America, it' not in the world. The sala
ries of hnr president and faculty are, to
s;iy the least, very Liberal, and are from
this time to be paid in full. Her income
irmous. in the near future she will
be, as she ought to be, txcmpt frum tax
ation, - tornla has the unenviable
iLg the only State in the
Union that taxes her churches and edu
cational Institutions. For these and many
similar reasons this university should fol
low the examph I et a 1 Berkeley and
remove this financial burden from the
shoulders of her students and patrons,
marly of whom are poor and are enduring
many hardships for the education which
Stanford affords.

which feems to be ascribed to crossing
the plains by the automobile from the

the possible danger of steep and heavy
grades to be met with on the route, ppr
mit me to state that such insurmountable
â¢ bstacles as would be conjured up in the
mind from the reading of Sunday's Call
axe only imaginary and on the road do
not exist. ( >f course 1 speak from per
sonal experience and observation, having
crossed on foot all of the following routes
to raining camps and places, viz., across
the State of f'>wa to Missouri River:

arising from the fact that he is the son
of his father. John is rich. Not merely
well-to-do, comfortably off, or in easy cir
cumstances, but really wealthy.
John has acquired this Croesus-like
competence by a variety of means. Some ;
of it has come to him by inheritance,
some has been gathered by hard work,
and much has been picked up by carefully
speculating in paris mutuels and other
stocks which are of uncertain stability
and have a habit of generally flopping the
way least expected.
John is what is generally known as a
"wise guy." He overlooks nothing, from
a champion ring contest to matching for ;
car fare. He even marks the sparrow's j
fall, and when th* bird is about to topple
John will be sure to- be found i
standing under the limb willing to
give or take odds on the man
ner of its lighting.. He is so well-in
formed that he seldom comes out at "the j
little end of the horn." Once in a while.
however, he gets up against It, as he did j
in the following instance.
Mrs. J. P. Jackson Jr. was sitting on the
porch of her house in Belvedere the other j
day when she was approached by a rather
seedy looking Individual who requested her j
to invest In a lottery ticket. Mrs. Jack- -
son complied. A few day 3 later the list
was published and Mrs. Jackson found
she was a winner to the extent of $10. She
said nothing to any one, but, putting on
her things, came over to the city to cash
in. What was her disappointment to find
the ticket was bogus.. That evening when {
her lord and master had finished his din- i
ncr she proposed a little game of freeze
out.
"I have here a ticket that has a $10 win- |
ning number on it. dear," she said. "I
will put It up against $10 and the one who
wins will take all."
John seeing something easy agreed to
take a chance. The stakes had hardly
been posted when his wife, declaring she
had a headache, stopped the game. "I j
really can't play any more, dear," she !
said. "You give me the money and take j
the ticket over with you to-morrow morn
ing and have it cashed." John did as she
requested.
The next day it cost John $4 25 for
liquids, $5 10 for a lunch and two wordy
altercations that almost resulted in mix
ups, and. to cap the climax, upon his re
turn home his wife sweetly informed him
that she had spent the ten he gave her j
and could not possibly refund It.
Say "Little Louisiana" to John now and
he buys without a word.

OLD GLORY IN THE BREEZE.
The prettiest sight in all San Francisco when the early sun
light fell athwart the bay this morning was the great, beautiful
flag floating from the pinnacle ;f The Call Building. As the mel
low sunlight gleamed on the unfolded splendor of the colors of Old
Glory there was not a citizen in this broad city who did not feel a
thrill and an impulse of patriotism. The spectacle of the Star-span
gled Banner, gleaming far up in the sky. excited more admiring
comment than any other incidental feature of the observance of the
T>ay of Patriotism in the City by the Golden Gate. â From the Re

THE DOUBLE BILL
AT THE
ALCAZAR
THE Alcazar presents a double bill
this weekâ "Only the Master Shall
Blame " and "Don Caesar de Ba
zan." Criticism of the curtain raiser
aa a play Is no affair of mineâ that
goes without saying. I made no haste to
read the journals In the morning, lest
"good digestion" might be prevented
from "waiting upon appetite." Resides,
there was no need for haste. I have the
good fortune to sit at a "truth-telling
breakfast table," and after listening to
all it had to say I reached out my hand
for the papers and the punishment, well
braced for a shock, and received a much
lighter one than I expected. I have been
told that my title was a deep, dark hint
to the critics. If so, they did not take
the hint. I have read all they had to
tell me and after extricating myself from
the meshes of "lady villains in melo
dramas," "superfluities," "hackneys" and
"handicaps" and many words of kind en
couragement. T acknowledge my faults,
promise to profit by the needed advice,
and snatch up my pen, ready to push my
way from the frontiers of drama Into the
thick of the fight.
I 'eel warranted In saying that Miss
Roberts played the role of Margaret Niel
in a manner S"~> charming as to earn the
deepest gratitude of the author, that Mr.
Whlttlesey, as Leary, was far better than
she builded. and that Mr. Platt. Miss
Crews Miss Banning and Mr. Dennl
thorne more than sustained their parts.
The change between Mis? Roberts' cur
tain fall and her entrance as Montana In
"Don Caesar de Bazan" shows most per
fectly the versatility of this clever little
woman. Don Caesar will never grow old
or cease to charm with Its swashbuckle
rollicking comedy. Mr. Morrison's grasp of
the character is a firm one. He speaks the
lines so as to bring laughs In just the right
places and holds the interest and sym
pathy of the audience to the curtain. Mr.
Whlttlesey was every inch the King and
wooed his Maritana with an earnestm ss
that ieft no doubt as to his deep infatua
tion for the bf-autiful, foolish dancing
girl. The play at the second perform
ance w< nt with that grateful swing and
dash that were lacking on the first night.
The minor parts are fairly well sustained
and ihe play, especially in the first act,
well mounted.

David R. Perry, the well-known con

Pup restaurant on Stockton street yes
terday morning by flourishing a revolver.
Imagining that he was being pursued by
some one who wanted to kill him. He
ran Into a rear room above the restaurant

him Then they ende force open

Ce Whalen was detailed to go to the rear of
the r.staurant and to effeci an entrance
by the window. He armed himself with a
hatchet and made his way over tn.
of houses on Market, and Stockton street*
till he reached 1 the Pup. Then he climbed
down the fire escape to the window of
Perry's room. When Perrj saw the officer
with the hatchet preparing to break^ in
the window he pulled the bedstead awa>

wrenched the weapon from him. He was
taken to the City Prison, wnere charges
of disturbing the peace and exhibiting a
deadly weapon were r feed against him.
Perry appeared to be suffering from the
effects of a prolonged debauch. In the
prison he imagined that he was the King

FIRE OF CRITICISM
Supervisors Doubt the Justice of
the Assessments.
It Is Claimed That No Equalization of Tax Burdens Has
Been Made, and That the City Has Been Placed
at the Mercy of the State.
THE assessment of city and coun
ty property made by Assessor
Dodge was the subject yesterday
of general comment Public offi
cials arid business men concerned
themselves in analyzing the As
sessor's figures with the result that
some interesting facts were developed.
The prevailing; opinion 'if? that the Ap
sepsor knowingly or unwittingly has
committed two glaring blunders In
his increase of city and county values
he has placed San Francisco at the
mercy of the State and has subjected
th-> people of the city to unequal and
unjust State taxation. The Assessor
has placed in the hands â ''" the State
Board of Equalization a weapon with
which to force San Francisco to pay
mor- than its share of the expenses of
the State" government.
More than this. Assessor Podge has
neglected to equalize city and county
taxation. While he has made the cor
porate and capitalistic classes pay more
than they have hitherto done and has
made them bear proportionately their
share of municipal taxes, he has not
reduced the assessed valuation of the
property of small real estate holders.
It is notorious that the majority of
small real estate holders have heen as
sesped comparatively higher than in
fluential property owners. The hold
ings of the. small owners have been tax
ed to the limit and in a just equaliza
tion the assessed valuation of these
holdings would have been reduced,
Assessor Dodge has made no reduc
tion in these assessed values. He has
on the contrary fncreased real estate
values over the assessment of his pre
decessor. The small holder is thus
placed in a peculiar predicament. If
the Supervisors honor the dollar-limit
pledge he will pay less in city and coun
ty taxes. but in consequence of the In
creased valuation of hi? property he
will pay more in State taxes. He thus
derive? a benefit and suffers an injury
at the same time. In discussing the
matter yesterday a Supervisor offered
Etn interesting suggestion. Assessor
Dodge, he insisted, should have reduc
ed the assessed values of the property
of small holders as well as increase
the assessment of corporations and
capitalists. What was added to the
burden of those that had escaped just
taxation should have been deducted
from the classes that had been over
burdened.
It is argued in defense of the Asses- I
sor that the classes that have been :
compelled to bear their just share of !
city and county taxes will be reed to
pay ih a increased taxation which will j
be levied by the State. While this is
true, it does not alter the fact that the
?nnll holders have not been relieved
from in unjust burden. If Assessor
I'odce had scaled down the assessed
valuation of real estate and had left
the total assessment at the figure it
was last year instead of increasing it
fooiOOO.OOQ he would have made a just
-'realization.
As it is the Assessor has placed the
rity utterly at the mercy of the State.
Th- State Board of Equalization has
had a disagreeable habit for years of
increasing the assessment of San Fran- i
ris'.o twenty per cent. If this is done
this year the boasted benefit given to
;he people of this city by the Assessor
will vanish into thin air. The State
2nd not the city will reap the Ivan
:ages of the Assessor's activity.
Another feature of the assessment is
sl=o creating considerable discussion.
Assessor Dodge intends, on the dubious
opinion of the Attorney- to as
;ess quasi-public and corporation bonds
to the extent of $21,000,000. This will
raise the total assessment to $407,000,000,
and upon this total the tax rate" will be
sxed. However this rate may be view-

corporation bonds will result in confu
sion. A member of th^ Board of Su
pervisors sutrcested yesterday that the
matter oueht to he tested in the courts
without subjecting the municipal gov
-1 eminent to the hazard of confusion
which seems almost inevitable. A test
I case rould be made, it is urged, and In
: making such a test the assessment of
bunds should not he Included in the
â¢ â¢ assessment. Tf this were done the
city would naturally receive its proper
revenues if bonds were taxable and
would loso nothing if they were not.
Under the plan adopted by the Assessor
there may he a deficiency. Under the
I I scheme there would be at
lÂ»a?t an orderly administration of af
fairs and there mieht be a surplus of
funds in the city and county treasury.
c of the Supervisors who will pas?
upon the, Asseppor'? estimate? have ex
amine.l the roll in detail, and they be
lieve that Dniic has shown unju?t dip
crimination in many cases. It Is claim
at certain very larpe firms and
corporations have b^en assessed on a
r cent basis, while others have
heen assessed practically on a nominal
valuation. There is a disposition on the
part nf certain members of the Board of
Supervisors to increase the assessment
of the Pacific Telephone and Telf^raph
Company, for example. The men who
ar p to sit as a city and county hoard of
lization do not believe that this
corporatfon has been adequately as
gessed, and it is not unlikely that its
books v. ill be demanded for examina
i tion.
The same opinion prevails in refer
ence to Wellp, Farpo & Co., which, it is
claimed, has not been assessed accord
ing to the value of its holdings nor in
proportion to other corporations. Bev
ther larpe taxpayers will also he
subjected to a searching inquiry. The
rvisors will bepin this work with
out delay and the results promise to be !
interesting. Tt may he fonnd that the
Assessor's boasted equalization of tax
na is In reality no equalization
that his announcement that, while
t vjr. aPP espe<i valuations of personal
property were Increased taxes were not,
may have more significance than it at
first seemed t n possess.
WAS MADE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN TWO EVILS
The Reason William Michaelson De- :
cided to Pay His Own Way
to Jail.
William Michaelson, who conducts a
stable on Ellis street, between Hyde and
I^arkin, was given the alternative of rid
ing to the Central police station in the
company of an officer on a cable car or
going to the same place in the patrol
wagon. He choose the car. When the
conductor came for his fare. Michaelson
demurred on the ground that he was. un
der arrest nd therefore exempt from tax- ]
ation The officer, however, informed him ,
! that if he persisted in taking that view
of the matter it would be very easy for i
1 them both to alight and take advantage
of the conveyance that a kindly munici- |
pal government had provided for just '.
â  such emergencies. Michaelson gave this I
proposition prompt consideration, weak- j
ened and coughed up the necessary nickel
without any further argument.
The reason of Michaelson's arrest was
i as follows: Harold Wheeler, an attorney
! with offices in the Crocker building, was
crossing New Montgomery street Monday
afternoon, when Michaelson driving at a
very fast trot swung around the corner.
He saw Wheeler, but made no effort to
either pull up or swerve out of the way.
Mr Wheeler, who is a gentleman well
advanced' in years, was struck by the
horse and knocked down, receiving severe
injuries on his leg and side. Michaelson,
as soon as he witnessed the accident,
whipped up the animal he was driving
and attempted to escape. Officer W. M. ;
Ross, who happened to witness the whole |
occurrence, promptly overtook him and j
put him under arrest, charging him with
. battery in addition to fast driving.
A MTJBDEROUS JAP.
Attempts to Carve a Sailor on the
Ship Tacoma.
A cutting affray occurred on the ship
Tacoma last evening, in which Charie.- a.
Muller received several severe knife
wounds on the face at the hands of G.
Feuomolo, a Japanese cabin boy. His
wounds were treated at the Harbor Hos
pital after which he was taken to the
Harbor Police Station to be held as a
- against his assailant, who was ar
rested by Officers Ferguson and Arduello.
er is the ship's carpenter and re
sides at 266 Brannan street. He has made
a number of trips on the ship and for
some time has failed to agTee with the
Japenese. Both hay frequently quar
reled, mid It is suppgsed to have been an
old gr.udge which caused the murderous
act. Last ni^ht th^ men had some dis
pute, which ended in Yeuomolo seizing a
large bread knife and making prepara
tions to carve his antagonist. He su<-
Cf-f-ded in inflicting several ugly gashes on
Muller's face, but was disarmed by by
standers before he had a chance to com
mit a murder. Police officers were soon
on the scene and the Japanese was
booked for assault to murder.
Fired Off His Pistol.
B. Childs. a clerk, was amusing him

PICNIC ENDS IN
A STABBING AFFRAY
TWO COLORED MEN MIX THINGS
NEAR OAKLAND.
Six Knife Wounds and Various Con
tusions the Portion of C. H.
Jackson.
OAKLAND, July 4â An ugly stabbing
affray occurred at Plitzville Park on the
county road this evening, just as the pic
nic given for the Old Colored Folks'
Home was breaking up for the day.
The principals were .1. C. Dennis, a col
ored musician. residing a.l 2507 Bush street.
San Francisco, and Charles H. Jackson.
a colored cook employed on th-> Pullman
dinine cars running between Oakland and
Offden, residing at 1833 Campbell street,
this city. Both men were arrested by
Deputy Sheriff Quinlan to-night. Jack
son was first tak^n to th* Receiving Hos
pital where he was treated tor six knife
wounds and otner injuries. Dennis was
alÂ«o treated for an ugly gash on the left
forearm. At the County Jail Dennis, who
la believed to be the aggressor was
charged with assault with a . d.
'' weapon, whfl-=> Jackson whs booked for
battery There were numerous others
Implicated in the mix-up, but they es
caped before the* officers could be sum-
m According to Dennis' story the row was
caused over the refusal of a doorkeeper
to admit him to the dinine-room. Jack
son, however, tells a different tale. HÂ«
I stated to-night that Dennis and his four
brothers were quarreling with 'Majan
Waters over an alleged insult given by
the latter, that he cautioned one OI the
brothers Andrew Dennis, to quit quar
reling and have respect for himsHf, wh<-n
J C. Dennis upbraided him for his lnter
"Suddenly I wns struck on the left
! shoulder." continued Jackson, "and T felt
the cold steel pierce my flesh. I struck
back and then started to run. but was
stabbed again and again in the back, and
finally tripped up. when the whole crowd
jumped on me. at the same time engaging
In a fr*e fight. I was stabbed six times,
and four of these w-re at the hands of
Dennis I was klrkfd in the mouth, and
after I got up and ran behind the coun
! ter in toe barroom Dennis throw a beer
bottle at me, hitting and cutting my head.
] knew no more after that.
The wounds, badly lacerated lips and an
abrasion of th*> right ear bear witness to
Tnck=on'-; story. Tt is believed a more
1 serious charge" than that of assault will
i be placed against Dennis.
Dennis' wound, on the right forearm
was inflicted by his brother Andrew as
the latter made a lunge with a knife also
directed at Jackson. Andrew is still at
large. The weapons used were ordinary
pocket knives.

SESSIONS' EXPLANATION.
Says Water Front Company Is Not
Selling Streets.
OAKLAND. July 4.â E. C. Sessions, the
agent of the Oakland Water-front Com
pany, says the Mayor Is mistaken regard
ing the title to the property on which
Balfour, Guthrie & Co. are now erecting
large warehouses.
Mr. Sessions says:
The small parcel of land now being built
upon by Balfour, Outhrle & Co. below First
street, extending to the center line of what
would be Market street. If continued below
First, is pome 3f>o feet north or inside of the
1 line and has perfect title. SamÂ» as th^
r " st r "" " f pancy. The only formal and
public dedication ot Mreetw maiii" at this p..int
was that madÂ» by the Kollenberger map.
which did net include anything below First
street.
Owing to the fact that the Oakland Water
Front Company (which owns at this point a
strip of land inside the patent line 800 fret
wide) has recently conveyed voluntarily to the
city by deed a strip of land in the lino of and
for the full width of what would be an ex
tension of Market street southerly of First
over this 300-foot strip, and also a strip equal
to one-half of the extension of Market street
in front of Balfour, Guthrie & Co., render* It
desirable that some arrangement should be
entered Into by the city for the, acquirement of
the portion of Balfour, Outhrie & â â¢-. >â  strip
â which would be included within an extension
of Market street. As to the pending litigation
between the city and the Oakland Water
front Company. I don't Bee that it cuts any
figure in the matter at all.
With the President.
The Holyoke (Mass.) Telegram and the
ITolyoke (Mass.) Transcript of the date of
June 17 contain an account extending over
several columns of the reception in that 1
city of President and Mrs. McKlnley, Mr. !

Mrs. Morse is a niece of the President,
and she and her husband, the clerk of the

FRENCH PARLIAMENT
TAKES A VACATION
PARIS, July 4.â ln the Chamber of
Deputies to-day Paul Beau regard, Repub
lican, representing one of the districts of
the Seine, submitted his promised Inter
pellation on the subject of the bill deal
ing with workmen's wages and the hours
of labor. He disputed the right of M.
Millerand. Socialist, Minister of Com
merce, to deal with the matter by decree,
as he pr posed, until at the next session.
The speaker was loudly interrupted by
members of the extreme left.
M. Millerand. in replying, disclaimed all
intentions upon the part of the Govern
ment to curtail the rights of Parliament.
Other delegates tried to debate the mat
ter, but the Premier, M. Waldeck-
Rousseau. declined to consent to this, and
the Chamber upheld him by 33S to 186
votes. The Premier then read a decree
proroguing Parliament for the long vaca
tion, and, amid applause from the leftists
and protests from the right, the House
was adjourned.
CONFERENCE AMENDS
ARBITRATION CLAUSE
Germans Wished It Made Optional
Instead of Com
pulsory.
THE (jAGI'E, July 4.â At a meeting thi*
afternoon of the arbitration committee,
the question whether arbitration Phould
be obligatory or optional arose anil ch-..-w
a declaration from the German delegate
to the effect that he had received formal
Instruction* not to acceet the pl>.-a of
obligatory arbitration otherwise than by
special convention.
Ln view of this statement, article 1 of
the Russian proposal was struck out and
replaced by a provision declaring that
arbitration should be optional, 1 xcopt in
cases of conventions between thf /-owth.
All the delegates agreed to this, M.
Bourgeois, head of the French delegation,
,}< daring that he had accepted it only as
a compromise.

with "interfering in an affair in which you are in no way conc.-rned." says: "If,
as a foreign sovereign, you thought you could lnlluence French officers in the
grave verdict they are about to pronounce, I leg you to note that we don't
in an equal footing, as none of us would condescend to call to account
a Prli <â¢>â  who is under tutelage.
"You are perhaps a relative of 1 >reyfus by marriage, but in this case It is

BRAZOS IS A
RAGING TORRENT
Reports Daily Become
More Alarming.
Special Dlspat I The Call.
ST. LOUIS, July I.â A special to the
Republic from Dallas, Texas, says: An
other flood disaster which, from the
first bulletin received here to-night, ap
pears to be worse than that at Calvert
on Friday and Saturday last, occurred
this afternoon in the KnizÂ«>s \ alley,
about 100 miles down the river from
Calvert. Reports say that the large
>!â â â¢â¢! bridge of the Missouri. Kansas
and Texas Railroad, at Dewey station,
near the crossing ol the Brazos River
is gone. The river in that section be
gan rising suddenly yesterday and to
night is six feet higher than ever be
fore known. Immense drifts of houses,
trees, fences, etc., are floating hy

are cominÂ«" in from La Grange and
Sealey of loss of life in the vicinity of
Brookshire. chief Lineman Lowrey of
ilim Postal Telegraph System, to-night
tlic following statement over the
long distance telephone from Sealey, -."
miles south of J 'alias: "The Brazos
River here is more than live miles wide
and the water lashing furiously. All
kinds of floatable property is
rushing along with the current. On
tin's side of the river, at Sealey, there
is ;ts yet little danger, but on the other
si'!*', Dewey and Brookshire, the condi
tions are terrible. Brookshire is thir
teen miles from Sealey and ?,7 miles
from Houston. \\V cannot Â£>â ' from
the Sealey sid>- to the Dewey and
Brookshire side, and as our wires are
all gone on that side, we cannot tell
t!;>- .-xtent of the disaster at Brook
shire.
"I reached Sealey to-night In a small
boat, after spending last ninht on an
Island four milt-s from here. The bit:
bridge of the Missouri, Kansas
Texas Railroad at Dewey is --is g las
ruined. It is covered with water and
the center span is six inches out of line.
The entire structure Is likely to go at
any minute. Four miles of Missouri,
Kansas and Texas track are gone on
the Dewey side and about a mile on the
Sealey side has been washed away.
"If boats and special trains from
Houston or other points have nut yet
reached Brookshir>' they are too late.
The people, I fear, â will be drowned be
fore they ran in- reached. This after
noon there were from three hundred
to four hundred persona on a small
Island near Brf.-okshire and the water
was rising rapidly. I fear they are
drowned by this time, as they had not
the slightest means of escape.
''The river here to-night is six feet
higher than in 1886, which was the rec
ord up to the present."
PAYMASTER WILCOX
MAY BE DISMISSED
Findings of the Court-Martial Now in I
the Hands of the Presi
dent.
NEW YORK, July 4.â A "Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
l."i;j? has forwarded to the President for
his action the record and finding of the !
court-martial which tried Paymaster Wil
lis B. Wllcox uf the navy. This means i
that the court found Mr. Wllcox guilty
of th<"- charge of drunkenness and recom
mended that ho be dismissed the service.
I understand that Secretary Ivng has rec
ommended that th'- finding be approved.
.Mr. Wilcox was trif-d at Mare Island, the
scene of the alleged offense. The report
current in naval circles concerning his
misconduct is t< *h" effect that upon his j
return from the Monadnock at Manila he
was sent to the naval hospital at San
Francisco for treatment. After his dis
charge from the hospital he was ordered
borne and granted leave, but his subse
quent condition was such as to lead to the 1
presentation of the charge upon which
he was tried.
Th< Secretary's recommendation that
the finding- be approved by the President
is based, it is said, upon a warning given I
to Mr. YV!li"ox some time ago. This officer
while at Manila earned the commendation
of Admiral Dewey by making a trip
across the island of Luzon with Naval f
Cadet White before the beginning of the j
insurrection. His report Is a very valu-
I able naval document.
STORES STONED BY MOB.
Rioting- Continues on the Streets of
Madrid and Barcelona.
MADRID, July 4.â At Alicante to-day
a mob stoned thf stores whose owners
refused to close. The Octroi offices were
set on fire by the rioters. During a
cavalry charge at Valencia a French
man who attempted to raise a flag at
a window was injured.
BARCELONA, July 4.â The disturb
ances were resumed here this morning.
Many stores were compelled to close
and the horse-car service was sus
pended. As the lines are worked by an
English company it is reported diplo
matic representations will be made to
the Government on the subject of the
damage sustained.
NICHOLAS TO THE FINNS.
Hopes the Suffering People Will
Prove Their Loyal 3>evotion.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 4.â While
refusing to receive the Finnish depu
tation, the Czar has issued a rescript
declaring that when he ascended the
throne he took up the sacred duty of
watching over the welfare of all peo
ple under thi> Russion sceptre and
"deemed it well to preserve to Finn
land the special fabric of internal leg
islation conferred on it by my mighty
forefathers." His Majesty then ex
pressed the hope that "the loyal devo
tion of the Finns would he proved to
the satisfaction of their Governor Gen
eral."

FOR ABE MAJORS
Outlaw Granted a Stay
of Execution.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, Utah, July 4.â Abe Ma.iora
will not be executed on Friday, Judge
Hart having granted a stay of execution
until the case may !><â  heard by the Su
preme Court of tin- State. While public I
sentiment gent-rally is strong apains*. the
young fellow In Qgden, the. ministers of
this city, the various women's soci itles
and even the prisoners in the State ;>â  nl
tentiary, where Majors now is confined, !
have taken up liis case, believing that it
was not h<' who tired the shot that killed
Captain Brown, but that it was the work
of his brother, who was killed. Police
offl< era generally, however, arc against
the stay of execution, and say the move
ment iii behalf of Majors is merely maud
lin sentiment.
The Call correspondent saw the con
demned man to-day at the penitentiary.
He was much pleased over the respite
granted, and Bald "he was satisfied that
when the case came before thÂ«- Supreme
Court he would be granted a new trial.
"There is no doubt in my mind." he
said, "that my conviction was the result
of prejudice, and was had in the heat of
the moment, without a due consideration
of facts in the case t >n.- tiling I wish
you would say for me- 1 never tired tho
shot that killed Captain Brown."
"You know the st'>ri>s that have been
printed about you in the California
press?"
"Yes, but I do not care to discuss that
now."

"Mr. Crocker win not secure sufficient
Cta t â  pui h!a project into â 
The â¢ Â» 1 1 1 >- iÂ« ason for this belief is that it
is t'"> r '<"'i. too liberal, a characteristic
of Mr. Crocker In bis dealings with the
grow< rs."
Interviews with :i numbpr of vineyard-
Ists to-day confirmed this opinion. They
hold back' in the belief that prices will go
still hiirher, and thÂ«y may lose better op
portunities by signing Mr. Crocker's con-
I : acts.
In this connection It may ho said th.-v
John I>. Bosch of Windsor, who is now
erecting the largest winery In the county
at Geyserville. Bad great difficulty in se
curing tho necessary contracts at $12 a
ton to warrant him in putting 1 up this
winery. This price was $2 a ton or more
above" the prices received by the vine
yardists last year for their Krnn<s. Now
comes Mr. Crocker with another $2 ad
vance, and tnÂ»- hopes of the growers are
aroused for still bettor prices.

Totally Destroyed.
THE CAUSE IS UNKNOWN
AGED FORTUNE TELLER HAS A
NARROW ESCAPE.
The Loss Is Estimated to Be at Least
$25,000, On Which There
Is Very Little In
surance.
Special Dispatch to The (rail.
RENO, July 4.â Fire broke out at the
southeast corner of Second and Virginia
streets at 10 o'clock to-night in a row of
wooden buildings and spread with alarm
ing rapidity. Shortly after 11 o'clock the
spread was checked, but by that time
half a block each on Virginia and Second
streets, extending respectively south and
east from the corner, was a seething
mass of flames. â¢
All of Reno's fire-fighting facilities, as
sisted by willing volunteers, have fought
the lire from behind hastily constructed
screens, the heat being so intense that
all the buildings across the street from
the Ore are badly scorched and have been
on Bre a number of times. j
On Virginia street, at the corner of
Becond, the first building destroyed was
that occupied by Fred Kohlster. tailor
Bhop; then 'â¢earne Dodson & Farrion's

Becond street the fire took in three build
ings owned by F. C. Vpdike and occupied
by a paint shop, paper Btore. carpenter
shop and an unoccupied house. These,
together with their contents, were totally
deal n >yed.
Being altogether wooden structures and .
a fair breeze blowing from the west, they
burned lik.- tinder. allowir"Â» no time to i
remove their contents. The spread of the
flames was so rapid that it was with diffi
culty that Mrs. Goodman, an aged and
decrepil fortune teller, was rescued from
her rooms. The front of the Washoe
County Hank was somewhat damaged by
beat. * The front and contents of H. J.
Thye's wholesale liquor establishment,
Porteous 1 Decorating Company and Fol-
Bom & Cahlan's grocery Btore suffered
considerable damage. Mrs. Needham s
furniture store was on fire twice, but was
finally saved. Â . ... ,
The fine business hb>ck recently built by
M>-, Oscar .1. Smith was scorched on the
south Bide Th.- loss is estimated to-night
at $25,000 insurance very little. The flre
originated near the rear of Dan Mays
shoe factory, but its cause is shrouded
in mystery.

SAVED A WOMAN AT
THE COST OF WOUNDS
H. BJJSSELL'S BK-AVETtY PRE
VENTS A FOUL mTEtDEB,
Thrilling' Struggle for Possession of a
Razor Ends in a Bloody Manner.
Barter Tamey In Hiding.
Howard Russell, a mining man. Is a vic
tim of his own daring. In an effort to
save a woman from certain death at the |
hands of a divorced and Intemperate hus
band, Russell received slashes from a
razor that will probably disfigure him for
life.
Last night Russell was passing: through
the hallway of 141 Taylor street on his
way to hie room, and on nearing: the
room occupied by a Mrs. Tamey he heard
a loud and threatening voice and the un
dertones of a woman pleading for her
life. Russell peered through the shutters
and recognized Tamey. Seeing he had a
razor in his hands and was nourishing
it before the eyes of the terrified woman,
Russell; without a moment's thought of
his own danger and without any weapon
of defer.s<; but his hands, burst into the
room and grabbed the drink-crazed bar
hf-r. Th>- latter upon diFcovering the ally
r.itned on Russell and swung his sharp
tool with deadly aim. Russell managed
tv avoid it by blocking the blow and he
closed in with Tamey.
The Inttor was fo â¢ -mined to commit
injury that he managed to get one of Rus
sell's fingers in his mouth and bit it se
verely. During the scuffle Mrs. Tamey
tried to zuiii possession of the razor, but
only succeeded in severely cutting her
f.ngÂ»-r.
Taniey managed to free his razor for a
moment nv.<l Inflicted two terrible gashes
Â«.n Russell's lace and head. Evidently be
coming frightened at his deed the drunken
razor-wl elder rusht-d from the house and
is now in hiding.
Russell bled profusely and he was sent
to the hospital in all haste. Dr. Heintz,
the surgeon on duty, attended the wound
ed man. Twenty stitches wore necessary ;
to close up the gaping gashes.
Russell said that Tamey had frequently
threatened to kill his ex-wife. The po- ,
lice are searching for Tamev.
AN AGED GATEKEEPER
STRUCK BY A TRAIN
James Tlerney, a gatekeeper for the
Southern Pacific Company at the cross
ing of San Jose avenue â¢ and Randall
street, was killed at 8:4.') last night by the
Incoming San Jose train. }-.<:â¢ train,
which was late, was being sent along at a
fast pace on the down prade toward Va
lencia street station. When the warning
bell notified Tierney of the train's ap-
J proach he proceeded to lower the gate? |
1 at the crossing, and in so doing attempted i
; to attach a lighted lantern to the gate I
;on the west side of the track. He appar- I
j ently miscalculated the speed of the ap
â¢ proaching train, and before he had time
, to cross the track the train was on top of
i him.
The engine, struck him in the hack and ,
j drove him against one of the poÂ»ts, split:
| ting hi? forehead in a perpendicular line
â  from his nose to the top of the head. He j
; died In three minutes after he received |
i the blow. Patrolman J. F. Dennan. who j
â¢ was near by when the accident occurred.
<iad the body removed to the Morgue. i
i Tierney had been in the service of the j
Southern Pacific Company during the past j
thirty' yeart=â lirst h.h a laborer, afterward
as a section hand an( ultimately as a \
gatekeeper. He was about 70 ears of age, I
unmarried; but has some nephews and
nieces in this city, whom he brought from
Ireland. It is sy'id that he was possessed
of considerable means, as he was an eco- '
j nomleal, sober man who attended to his
business and saved his money.
Jame? Hewitt was the engineer in
charge of the train. He said he did not
see the man until he was so pear him it
I was useless to try to stop his heavy rain.
jHe whistled to him. but it was of no I
I aval!. The man was thrown to one side
â¢ and was not caught under the wheels.
I His duties did not require him to cross
â  the track at the mom. nit he did.

which struck James Tierney, was arrest

ENCINAL CITY STIRRED
BY ITS LOCAL SCANDALS
ALAMEDA, July The unceremonious
dismissal of A. V. Fisher from the city
Electric Light Department threatens to
disrupt the Harmonic Hall party. The
leaders discovered when they let him out
to make a political Job for Thompson's
Eon that he had more friends in the rank
and file of the party than they calculated
upon. While the Harmonic Hall major
ity in the Board of City Trustees has been
wielding the ax in true political fashion
Fisher's friends in the party have been
sharpening their scalping knives and have
warned Trustees Mackie and Schulte and
Chairman Brick that war will be declared.
The Harmonic majority approved last
night the action of the Electric Light
Committee In discharging Fisher, and ac
cording to the programme named Thomas
Thompson for the place. There was no
discussion over the matter. Fisher will
make a claim for July salary in full. lie
refused to recognize as official the un
signed notice of June 30 that his services
were no longer required. He did not turn
over his books and continued his regular
duties until his office was declared vacant
last night. As he was employed by the
month he will claim that ho worked part
of July and is consequently entitled to a
full month's pay.
After the meeting adjourned last night
Fisher followed Brick Into the City
Clerk's ofllce and gave the chairman of
the board a severe tongue lashing. Ho
called him a coward and an unscrupulous
politician who did the bidding of Trustee
Mack .;_' ÂO
The newspaper men were present and
Brick told Fisher that it was not 300 1
business to talk so plainly before repre
sentatives of the press. Fisher accused
Brick of making defamatory statements
concerning him to J. O. Messer, another
ex-employe of the electric " light depart
ment. This charge the chairman re
fused to discuss. railing to get any satis
faction out of Brick, Fisher returned to
the Council Chamber to have a personal
encounter with Mackie a.llll Schulte, but
the two Trustees had departed.
The holiday has somewhat quieted the
excitement that followed the Lamborn-
Schulta scandal, but startling develop
ments are looked for as soon as the
Fourth is over. Mr. Lamborn declared
that he will not let the matter rest and
will drop a bombshell into the camp of his
accusers that will shake the city from hill
to bay He also asserts that he will glvo
Schulte an opportunity to prove his ac
cusations as a defendant In an action for
libel. .
\lnmeda has never experienced so much
excitement In the conduct of municipal
affaire and the citizens expect that many
dark official cats will be let out of the
bag before the occupants of the City Hall
finish their fight.

FIRES AND MISHAPS OF THE FOURTH.
A BOX FACTORY IN
NORTH BEACH DESTROYED
! The Festive Firecracker Starts a
Number of Small Blazes Through
out the City.
The Clatsop Milling Company's box fac
tory on the corner of Powell and Chest
nut street?, was totally destroyed by fire ,
laÂ«=t night. The buildings were long low
sheds and but little pecuniary loss was
suffered from their destruction. The
Bheds however, were filled with cut box
wood' supplies, and It Is estimated that
115.000 worth of material was consumed.
The lire was first noticed by Miss Emma
Hepp, who was walking along Powell
street about 10:20 o'clock. She saw the
blaze break out in the center of the roof
of the building, and without waste of time
rushed to the corner, where she procured
an alarm key. Up Lombard street she
ran to Mason and turned In the alarm.
Before the tire department arrived the
box â  tory was burning furiously and .
the flames rapidly spread throughout the
structure A second alarm was then rung
in and every effort made to confine the
llames. In this the firemen were success
ful though at one time it looked as if the
house of L,. Cuneo, south of the factory,
would be destroyed.
The fire was of the stubborn kind,
the smoke clinging to the ground and
forming clouds which no light could pen
etrate The firemen fought the confla
gration as much with axes as with water,
devoting most of their energies to the
saving of surrounding buildings. \\ hen
! the second alarm was sounded the lire
had gained such headway that the com
plete destruction of the building could not
be prevented.
The Clatsop Milling Company ib an
Astoria lumber and box manufacturing
ration of which J. M. Huddart is
manager. The company had recently laid
in their summer supply of box lumber and
was very heavily stocked. Most of the
work done at this factory was simply

O /^n AKIJVND. July 4.â Curtner Seminary, at Irvington. was burned

Why do the vaudeville houses pay
such price? Well, drop in at the Or
pheum and you will find out for your
Â«elf. Hayes and Lytton do what prac
tical managers describe as "making
good." ThÂ«Â»y keep the crowd Jellyinp
with laughter all the while they are on
the stage; they delight the groundlings
and compel laughter from the wise;
they own every inch of the house for
twenty solid minutes. Your better na

brutal, vulgar, more obvious in its
physical fun than the worst of the
British comics; hut it ls to laugh that

Company's steamer Coptic, which arrived J
from the Orient last Monday night, is ;
still in the stream. There is no room for
her at the Mail Dock, nor will there be
until the Rio de Janeiro sails for China!
to-morrow. The quarantining erf the Nip- j
pon Maru has upset all the arrangements j
of the Pacific Mail and O. and O. people,
and it will be a week or so before the
Mail Dock is back to a normal state of |
affairs To make matters worse and till j
further delay the Nippon Maru no work j
could be dona on that vessel yesterday, |
The Collector of the Port positively re- ,
fused a permit to work the ship, so no
cargo could be discharged. It Is now ,
doubtful a? to whether she will get away ;
on Saturday or not.
ThÂ« Coptic brought over ?5 cabin, 22 sec- j
ond cabin. 30 Japanese and 364 Chinese j
steer-.. passengers. Among those in the j
cabin were Mrs. J. M. Shotwell, widow of ;
the late Captain Shotwell. who hag been i
making a pleasure trip through the
Orient; Alex Rutherford, stepson Oi j
George Crocker, who has been on a pleas- :
ure- trip and the owing army and navy
officers "i doctors and clergymen: Colonel |
F W \nies, i: S. V., Lieutenant Richard ;
Eltz. utenant H. E. Parmenter, U. S. ;
N. and Lieutenant Ralph Zurn; Rev. \\ .
J. Callahani wife and two children; Rev.

Mateer. wife and child; Rev. C. P. Pit- ;
blado and Rev. F. C B< rgstrom, wife and ;
two children; Dr. J. H. Raymond, Dr. A.
L Warner and Dr. M. Leise.
\lrÂ« A Â Nichols; widow of the late
Captain H. B. Nichols of the monitor
Monterey; was also a passenger.
All the Coptic cabin and second-class .
passengers were land* d in the tug Mill* i
Griffith yesterday morning. The steerage j
pasengers were placed in quarantine and :
will remain there until all have been i
fumigated.
captain Pier Peterson has had a strange |
experience with the men set over the li- i
censing of masters and pilots. He was ;
granted a certificate as mate of a earner ,
by tho local inspectors and rejected by the
examining doctor. Then the men who 11
--censed' him as a mate refused him a cer
tilicato as master and were upheld by the |
Supervising inspector, but all were re- j
versed by the Supervising Inspector Gen- j
eral, who lias granted him his certificate j
as master.
Peterson was for a long time mate of
the sugar packet C. D. Bryant and later i
of the Levi G. Burgess. He had a posi- j
tion as mate of a coasting steamer offered !
him, and in order to qualify had to cure I
a license. He wont before United States !
Inspectors or Hulls and Boilers Bolles and â 
Bulger and passed the necessary exanuna- ;
tion. When he went before the Marina i
Hospital doctor, however, that gentleman !
turned him down for color blindness.
So far so good. Peterson went mate of ;
a steamer, and a month ago was seised :
with a desire to get a master's papers. '
CAUGHT IIN /\ STORM OFF CAPE HORN.
THE American ship Cyrus "Wakefleld, now on her way hero from New York, has been particularly unfortunate
this voyage. Heavy weather was encountered off the Horn, and In consequence the vessel was damaged and had
to put into Port Stanley. Captain Henry died and was burled while the vessel was In the Falkland Islands. Cap

Wakefleld to San Francisco.
About two years ago the Cyrus "Wakefleld waa caught In a heavy storm off the capÂ« and was badly strained. On
her arrival here she had to undergo extensive repairs. At that time. Captain Henry furnished Mr. Coulter with a de
scription of the vessel as Bhe appeared In a Cape Horn atorm.

He went before the- Inspectors again and
passed the examination, but again failed
in the color te-st. On this occasion Messrs.
Bolles and Buiger would not test hirf pig-iit
by means of the lights, on the ground that
a* ruling of the Supervising Inspector
General forbade it. I'r-terÃon was ac
cordinjrly refused a master's certificate.
He appealed the case, to Supervising In
spector Birmingham and that gentleman
upheld the local Inspectors. Then Peter
son appealed to Supervising Gen- ral
Damont. at thÂ« same time laying all the
facts of the case before him. Damont :
carefully considered the appeal, and a
few days ago notified Supervising In
spector Bermingham that Peterson was
entitled to his master's papers.

MAISON`S DEATH
IS SHROUDED IN
DEEP MYSTERY
Alcoholism Given as a
Primary Cause.
WAS WOUNDED FEW DAYS AGO
STRUCK BY A BICYCLE, IT IS
CLAIMED.
It Is Known That He Was Cut by a
Knife, but His Relatives De
cline to Discuss the-
Matter.
I
The death of Henry A. Malson, which
occurred at the Pacific Hospital on Mon
day, is shrouded in mystery, but the pre- j
vailing opinion Is that it was due to al- j
coholism.
He was 21 years of ago and the son of
the late Henry A. Maison. a well-known
liquor merchant. He had been employed ,
in the store of his uncle. B. H. L-ucke, the
shoe merchant, on Market street, but lost i
his position recently owing to his intemp
erate habits.
Saturday morning last he was taken to
the Receiving Hospital from Beale and
Mission streets by a stranger, and it was
found that there was a deep incised
wound on his right leg near the hip and
bruises or his head. He was under the !
influence of liquor, and all the explana
tion he would give as to how he received ;
the wound was that while In Oakland he
had been struck by a bicycle. While his!
wound was being stitched and dressed the i
police were notified; and Detective Harry |
Reynolds was sent to interview him. His
answer to his questions was the same â
that he had 1 en struck by a bicycle, al
though the doctors thought it looked more ,
iik<Â» a knife wound. . .â¢-â ..'
His relatives were notified and they had ;
him removed to the Pacific Hospital,
where he was attended by Drs. Hess and ;
Evans. He was unconscious most of the '
time until he died, about noon Monday.
When he became conscious for a few min
utes he spoke about being struck by a hi- <
cycle, Dr. Hess wv alc.o^oifp^r 1 â  (C ***â 
primary cause of death, and acute neph
ritis, or inhammatiou vi vie Â«irOiiicyj>; a.a
a contributory cause He expressed the
opinion that the injuries might have i
caused death, but was satisfied that alco- \
holism was the real cause. The remains <.
â .>â â â¢ removed to the family residence at |
117 Beulah street.
It Is suspected that young Maison was i
cut with a knife instead of being struck
by a bicycle, but as the relatives re
fuse to take any action in the matter ;
nothing will likely be done to clear up the i
mystery. , .
RIEHI/S LIVE-SAVING KITES.
The Doctor Tests Them in a Long
Swim From San Francisco to
Oakland.
T>r. Fred Rl^hl. aided by his life saving
kitep, started from Harrison street wharf j
on a long swim to Oakland yesterday
afternoon. There was a T>is crowd down
to c f .(. th^ doctor off and th*-ir patience
was tried somewhat, as it took nearly an
i fly the kites. As It was. the doc
id to start with two only to as- I
lim, as the other two could not be
raised.
There was a strong westerly breeze
blowing along the front, but out in the
â¢ i ame more from the southwest and
unce Dr. Riehl had to land on
Goat Inland. When he found that he 1
could not raise the third and fourth kite, \
the doctor went aboard the American ship !
Kenilworth and put on a bathing suit.
Then he did his clothing up In an oilskin
bag and fastening that around hiH shoul- â 
ders Jumped Into the water. T,he bag I
served as a kind of life buoy, and when !
the kites began to pull they moved the j
doctor through the water at a lively rate. j
Dr. Rlehl asserts that the kites and j
oilskin bag as constructed by him would I
be valuable aids to saving lire in case of j
shipwreck. Ho reasons that in every case j
almost of a ship going ashore the wind
is toward the land. A human being there
fore who was made fast to one of these
kites would be naturally carried ashore, j
while in the oilskin bag would be a por- ;
tion of his effects.
When about half a mile, from the- Oak
land shore Dr. Rlehl was attacked with
cramps and -would have drowned had it
not been for his kites, which kept him
afloat and sustained him, until he. recov
ered.

HAWAII HAS A
BAR ASSOCIATION
A Temporary Organiza
tion Effected.
Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, June 27.â -For some years
past fruitless attempts have been
made to organize a bar association for
the Hawaiian Islands, but on Saturday
last a temporary organization was ef
fected with Judge J. M. Davidson aa
chairman and Mr. Case as secretary, and
permanent organization will follow this
week.
About one-fourth of thd bar were pres
ent, but they were principally gentlemen
who have but recently arrived, very few
being of ten years' Ftnnding at the bar.
It is generally accepted, however, that
the entire bar is In sympathy with the
movement.
An unexpected incident was the intro
duction of a voluminous preamble and
resolution by George D. Gear of the Cali
fornium bar, petitioning- Congress on the
part of the Hawaiian bar against the pro
vision of the Commissioners' bijl in Con
â¢ - for the future government of Ha
waii, providing for the retention in office
of the Justices of the Supreme Court ami
the Judges of the> Circuit Court for prac
tically a iife tenure. After a hot debate
the matter was postponed until the next
meeting. The recent opinions of the Su
!>:â¢ me Court hoi. liner that the constitution
of the L'nlted States Is not operative in
Hawaii is at the bottom of the movement,
which la supported by local journals de
nouncing the bench as treasonable and
traitorous.
George D. Gear brought up the sub
ject of petitioning the President of the
I'nited States to strike out certain pro
visions in the Hawaiian enabling act re
lating to the local judiciary, and offered
the following resolutions:
Whereas, Tin* commission appointed by the
President of the United States to recommend
â  'lKress legislation concerning the Ha
waiian Inlands, under the provisions of the
Joint resolution of rnnKrcps, approved July 7.
IS \ ln their report contained in Benate <ii u
of the Fifty-fifth Congress at the
third session ther^if, have recommended that
II laws in Section lit.', Chapter 81, shall
as follows:
Supreme Court rhall consist of a
istice and two Assoi late .Justices, pro
however, that the existing Justices of
.-.Tome < 'ourt. shall exercise their func
tions as Justices o-f the Supreme Court
â¢.s .if this chapter according to
their constitutional t^nurp of office." And in
the bill Introduced In the Senate of the United
States by Air. i.'ullom, in the Fifty-fifth Con
gress at the thiid session thereof, heintr Ben
ate Mil 4^93, reported with amendment Decem
ber 21, I^OS, neine entitled "A bill to provide n
gnvprnment for the Territory of Hawaii," It Is
provided In Section 81 thereof, relating to the
ar !> 'Intment, removal, tenure and salaries of
officers, that, among other thing*. "All persons
holding office in the Hawaiian Islands at thÂ»
time this act takes effect shall, except as
herein otherwise provided, continue to hold
their respective offices until such offices be
come vacant, but not beyond the end of the
first session cf the Senate, unless reappointed
as herein provided, except the Chief Justice and
Associate Justices of the Stiprome Court ar}*
the Judges of thÂ» Circuit Courts, who shall con
tinue In ofl cc until their respective offices be
come vacant," and.
Whereas, In the bill Introduced In the House
of Representatives by Mr. Hltt, In the Fifty
fifth Congress at the third session thereof, being
House bill No. 10,930, reported with amendments
January 23. 1899, being- entitled "A bill to pro
vide a government for the Territory of Ha
waii," a similar provision Is contained as In
Senate bill 4893.
Resolved, That we, the Bar Association of the
Hawaiian Islands, deprecate any proposed
jurisdiction in the action of Congress discrimi
nating in favor of the present Judicial officers
as against all the other officers of the Govern
ment bo as to continue all the present incum
bents of the Supreme Court in office for life,
and to continue all the present Judges of the
Circuit Court in office during their term of
office irrespective of any new appointment such
as Is required In the case of all other offices
of the Hawaiian Ciovernment, and
Resolved. That we request the Senate and
House of Representatives of the United States
of America In Congress assembled to strike out
from the proposed biUs the parts thereof con
tinuing such present Judges In office, and that
tho Judges be not accepted from the operation
of the law applicable to the uppolntment of all
other officers.
George A. Davis. F. W. Hankey, Georpe
Gear, A. S. Humphreys and others sp-oke
In favor of the resolutions. E. P. Dole
and A. B. McClanaban favored a more
representative meetlnp. The matter was
Important and should be discussed and
noted upon by the whole bar. Mr. Hum
phreys was willing to carry the matter
over. On motion It was deferred to an
other conference to be held Wednesday
afternoon.
Mr. dear guve> notice of his intention to
Introduce a resolution requesting: Presi
dent McKlnley to secure from the Attor
ney General a ruling on recent decisions

GOOD FRUIT YIELD.
Bartlett Pears Are Plentiful and.
Bring Good Prices at Suisun.
SUISUN, July 4.â The yield of Bartlett
pears in Suisun Valley this year is the
largest in many years, and growers are
reaping a harvest in consequence of the
prevailing prices.
R. D. Robbins, the largest owner of or
chard land in Solano County, has entered
into contract to deliver to the Earl Fruit
Company 40,000 boxes of Bartlett pears,
the price being withheld. Although the
exact figure was not given It has been
authentically intimated that it is either Jl
a box or within a very few cents of this
amount. In fulfilling this contract Mr.
Robbins will not have to make up the
quantity from orchards not his own. Near
ly all the pears in the valley owned by
other growers have been sold to the AHen
Anderson Fruit Company and the Earl
Company at prices ranging from 75 cents
to 90 cents per box. Apricots also have
been a source of profit to growers, netting
65 cents per crate of twenty-two pounds
each. Unpacked cots averaged $40 per ton
to canners.
Big Blaze in Sonoma.
SONOMA. July 4.â A flre started in the
heart of the business center of the town
at about 9 o'clock last night. The fire
originated In the rear of C. Agulllon's large
winery and residence. In ten minutes the
flre had gained such headway that it was
feared the entire block would go. Three
barns Just filled with hay became ignited.
Flying sparks and cinders set many small
er fires going, and the firemen had their
hands full, but with a small force of water
to fight the conflagration. For a while
Aguillon's distillery was endangered.
Everything in the barns was totally de
stroyed. Three hay and wood storage de
partments were consumed and the build
ings burned to the ground. C. Agulllon.
L. Ferrer and J. Van Every are heavy
losers. The origin of the flre is unknown,
but as the roof was first seen in flames
a skyrocket 1b supposed to have been the
cause.

BELGIUM
ESCAPES A
REVOLUTION
The Socialists Have Bought
Arms to Overthrow the
Monarchy.
THEY MAY YET ACT
â â
For the Present the Premier Has
Bowed Before the Threatened
Storm.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald Copyrighted, 1899. by James Gor
dor, Bennett.
BRUSSELS, July -The Belgian
kingdom certainly escaped to-day a
great shaking up. The socialists, who
are admirably disciplined, had pur
chased firearms, collected stores of
every kind to fight the police, the con
stabulary and all representatives of
authority, and organize a real insur
rection, had M. Van den Peerboom'e
bill not been withdrawn. The danger
has subsided for the present. It is
thought, however, thai the special i
committee, to which the three alterna- \
tive bills have b^en referred, might fail ;
to agrree, and that a dissolution of Par- j
liament with an appeal in the country
on the question of universal suffrage
will come.
Should the commi - any ;
bill distasteful to the Socialists and
IJher surrection will only have
been postponed a few days, or weeks.
The opposition is in the greatest ear
nest ready to lose and spill I
v'hile the truce is complete, and
with the assistance of a downpou
rnln. Brussels to-night is
lively quiet, although the "Mai
lalse" and "O Van den Peerboom" are
freely sung under umbrellas.
The Brussels correspondent of the
Paris Figaro gives some striking offi
cial figures, which reveal in a clear â 
light the moving cause of th.- crisis
that has shaken Belgium to its center
and pt ill th revolution. The
Chamber of Deputies is composed of
â  mbei-p. The Government or Cler
ical vote at the lHst election
rosentatives in this body was 993,857,
while the opposition vote for Socialists
and Liberals together wslb 936,237.
On a fair, equitable system of repre
sentation this would give the Govern
ment about seventy- eight and the op-l
position seventy-four representatives,
;>r a meager majority of four for the
farmer. Now, as a matter of fact, the
Clericals have 11^ members and their
â ipponents only forty; that is to say,
while the Clericals outnumber the Lib
â rals and Socialists at th- polls by
fewer than 58,000 votes in the total vote
jf nearly 2,000,000, they outnumber them
In the Chamber by nearly three to 0n,..
Such is the practical effect of the
present system of proportionate repre
sentation arid plural voting since its
adoption some six years ago Thut sys
tern has been assailed bj Socialists and
[liberals and has even been dlsi
by moderate Clericals. The necessity of
reforming It has been 1 by
King Leopold, but the bill br
ward by Premier Van den Peerboom.
though ostensibly a reform measure, Is
really designed to make matters w
Its practical effect can only be to
strengthen the Clerical majority. That |
evidently is its purp<
That the Government has made not
only a mistaken but a dangerous move
in bringing it forward is sufficiently
shown by the serious crisis it has pre
cipitated. It has united Socialists and
Liberals in solid opposition, whose
strength and determination may well
cause the King as well as the Clerical
Premier great concern.
In the chamber at Deputies to-day
M. Van dÂ»-n Peerboom, at the opening
of the session, reiterated the Govern
ment's strong desire to effect a con
ciliation and pacify the public mind.
He continued:
"The Government considers there is
ground for entertaining the counter- j
electoral proposals suggested by varl- i
ous members and submitting them to
a. committee on which all parties will
be represented. The Government, In
the meanwhile. Is prepared to consider
the necessary steps to accomplish the
desired understanding."
M. Van der Valede. Socialist, on be
half of the two parties of Leftists, sup
ported the ministerial proposal, which
he declared was equivalent to the with
drawal of the Government Bcheme. He
declared the parties of the Left would
remain united in order to combat any
attempt of the Government to resume
offensive tactics and to prevent any
fresh party coup.
M. Welste declared the Rightists
â¢would remain equally united for the
defense of the constitutional liberties.
ANTWERP, July 4.â At a meeting of
thÂ© Provincial Council to-day a Coun
cilor belonging to the Left proposed a
resolution in favor of the rejection of
the new electoral bill. A Rightist Coun
cilor protested that the resolution was
a censure of the Government. This
was a signal for an uproarious out
burst In the public galleries, where
there were shouts of "Down with the
Government," "Down with the thieves,"
"Down with the priests" and the "Mar- ;
BelUalfle" was also sung.

ALL HAWAII MOURNS THE
DEATH OF KAPIOLANI.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, -Tune 27.â Kaplolani,
Queen Dowager of the Hawaiian
Islands and relict of the late King
Kalakaua, quietly passed away at
8:45 on the morning of Saturday/ June
24, aged 63 years and 6 months. Her
as. Prince David and Prince Cu
pid. h- a r medical attendants, and a few
friends and relatives were at her bed
side.
The cause of death Is certified to as
uraemia, superinduced by a complica
tion of diseases and paralytic strokes.
For the past few weeks the Queen
iger's death had been almost daily
ted, and the calm and peaceful
ending of a noble and womanly life
brings a sorrowful solace without the
painful shock of unpreparedness.
Kapiolani way the third of that hame
t . leave an Indelible praiseworthy rec
ord in the pages of Hawaiian history.
The first Kapiolani to attract attention
in the earliest days of reliable tradition
after the semi-mythological period dis
-1 her independence of character
by violating the laws of tabu by eating
the forbidden fruitâ the bananaâ the
exclusive property of the males, and
although her nobility of descent and
charm of character saved her own life,
the death of hÂ°r guardian or tutor was
claimed in accordance with the lex
talionis of the age.
Th>- second Kapiolani, a relative of
the dead Queen Dowager, was the fa
mous Christian heroine who, in 1824,
acting under the civilizing influence of
the early American missionaries, defied
â  resumed supreme power of the
Hawaiian fire goddess Pele in the very
stronghold of her sulphurous domains.
rater of the living volcano, violat
ed an<l destroyed the tabus and by "one
of th<- greatest acts of moral courage
ever performed" most materially as
slsted In weakening the power of super

HORSELESS
CARRIAGES
IN BATTLE
Spa* In! Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 4. â Though
aware of the advantages of horseless
carriages for the artillery service, the
Board of Ordnance and Fortifications
of the army has practically decided that
the vehicle has not yet been sufficiently
developed to warrant its adoption in
the military service. The board has
had under consideration a proposition
to construct an automobile for experi
mental purposes, an inventor having
announced that he has obtained a light
motor for driving the heavy carriage
necessary to accommodate a gun and
ammunition and stand the recoil of the
weapon after discharge. The advan
tages of the horseless carriage for ar
tillery service are so evident that if a
satisfactory vehicle could be found it
undoubtedly would be experimented
with.
There are disadvantages, however,
which the board has had to consider,
such as the comparatively short dis
tance the electric carriage would go,
the heavy weight of the storage batter
ies and the necessity of frequent re
charging and the difficulty of securing
a vehicle which, while of light weight,
could stand the wear and tear to which
an ordinary gun carriage can be put In
military operations.
If good roads were always assured
the board would quickly find a suitable
automobile, but in the operations in
the Philippines, for instance, it is
pointed out that good roads are the ex
ception, and, besides, it is often neces
sary to go at a sharp pace across fields
in which there are numerous gullies.
Nearly all the nations of Europe are ex
perimenting with horseless carriages
for the artillery service, but none, ac
cording to reports which have reached
here, have met with success as to de
termine it to replace its present car
riages with the new invention.
Military experts here believe that If
horseless carriages are adopted for the
American service they will be propelled
by steam or oil. By such means, it is
stated, enough fuel could be carried to
go a considerable distance and the dis
advantage of electric carriages of hay

DEATH CHAMBER OF KAPIOLANI.

noble and generous character, Instinct
and impulses and a lovable person in
the home and domestic life, quiet and
unassuming, but with a reflective mind
and a firm temperament in business
and social matters. She will be en
throned in the hearts of Hawaiian wo
men as the originator and founder of
the Kapiolani Maternity Home and the
Kapiolani Home for C.lrls, while her
private gifts in charity were bounded
only by her means. She won honors,
too, as the ever faithful and loving
v. [fe and as a widow who honestly paid
off a great burden of debt bequeathed
to her by her husband. King Kalakaua,
whose extravagances were a memor
able feature ( ,f a reign which marked
the great commercial development of
Hawaii under the reciprocity treaty,
the herald of annexation tolling the
death bell of monarchy.
The late Queen Dowager Kapiolani
was born at Hllo, Hawaii, on December
31, L 835. Her father was Kuhio and
her mother Kinoike. both of the high
chieftain line of Kaual and Xiihau. At
eight years of age she was taken to
Koua, Hawaii, and lived with noble
families until she was sixteen, when
she W as brought to Honolulu, and at
the age of twenty married the high
chief Xamn.keha. To their charge
was intrusted the bringing up of the
heir to the throne, the Prince of Ha
waii, whose death led to the dynastic
changes in the ruling dynasty. Shortly
after her return from a voyage to Mi
cronesia with her husband on the
schooner Hoku An 'the death of her
husband left her a childless widow.
On Dr-cemher 19, 1863, she married
Kalakaua, a high chief in government
employ, but ignorant of the great fu
ture in store for him. In 1874 destiny
called Kalakaua to the throne and the
consequent coronation of Kapiolani as
Queen Consort. From that day she de
voted her best energies to the welfare
and social improvement of her people,
especially of the women and children,
and, being childless, she embraced the
whole nation as her family and loved it
dearly. Her visit to the United States
and Great Britain on the occasion of
Queen Victoria's Jubilee is still fresh In
the memory of the readers of The Call.
After the death of King Kalakaua, in
San Francisco in 1891, the Queen Dow
ager lived in peaceful retirement and
increased her interest in charitable and
beneficial duties. Since the revolution
of 1893 she has earned the good-will of
the party in power by a total absti
nence from even the slightest approach
ing to return to the charging stations
would thus be obviated.
CARDINAL VAUGHAN
IS AN IMPERIALIST
NBW YORK, July 4.â A Sun cable
from London says: A declaration of
immense importance concerning the
fate of the Philippines and all Asia
was made to-night by Cardinal
Vaughan, archbishop of Westminster,
at the Independence day banquet given
by the American Society in London.
There is good authority for saying that
his utterance is an authorized an
nouncement of the policy of the Roman
Catholic Church on the Far Eastern
question. When it is said that he as
tonished and electrified his audience by
his eloquent appeal to America and
England, in co-operation, to carry civ
ilization into Asia in opposition to Rus
sia it may easily be imagined what . a
sensation his words created.
Nor was his the only Imperialistic
speech of the evening. It was the key
note of every word spoken and the
spirit of imperialism aroused enthusi
asm surpassing anything witnessed at
former gatherings of Americans in Lon
don. The banquet was attended by the
largest and most representative assem
bly of Americans ever held in Europe.

before leaving for the United States.
Admiral Dewey, Colonel Denby, Pro

man will meet in Washington during
the autumn to compile a report of the
commission's labors.
The commission recently investigated
the question of currency and the Chi
nese problem as it presents itself here.
A large majority of business men wish
to continue on a silver basis. There are
a few, however, who favor a gold
basis or the adoption of the Japanese
system.
The Filipinos are anxious to exclude
Chinese labor on " the other hand,
many large employers prefer China
men, asserting that they are more effi
cient, although the element of cheap
ness doubtless influences this view.

On being notified of the death of
Queen Kapiolani the Cabinet, in the

SCIENTISTS
CAPTURE THE
SEA SERPENT
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. July 4.-What Is likely to
prove a star" attraction at the Aquarium
Is an ugly looking and evil tempered
.specimen of a Bermuda moray, or sea eel,
which reached the Aquarium yesterday,
along with various other curious speci
mens from southern waters. The ship
ment, was by the Quebec line steamship
Orinoco, which arrived during the day.
The big eel, or "sea serpent," as it has
been called, was captured in a coral reef
cave off Bermuda, through the efforts of
Professor Charles L. Bristol, of the bio
logical department of the New York Uni
v.-rsity, who sailed for Bermuda last
May, accompanied by six of the univer
sity students, their purpose being to make
a study of the interesting and great va
riety of flsh which inhabit southern
waters.
This sea eel owes its chief distinction to
its size. It measures seven feet in one
direction and about eight inches in an
other. Several others have been on ex
hibition, but none of them could equal in
size the overgrown specimen which was
installed la its tank yesterday. After
sliding into its new home it wriggled and
sji); -lied and darted about for a quarter
of an hour, and then, having satisfied it
self of the extent and boundary of its new
and narrow world, it stretched out its
seven feet of vertebrae and went philo
sophically to sleep.
The moray was brought here In an es
pecially contrived tank, the Ship's pumps
furnishing a constant supply of fresh sea
water. It Is said the big eel 1b known to
the negro fishermen of Bermuda and the
Bahamas as the "devil's terror." It.s
mouth, which is somewhat like an alli
gator's in general shape, Is fitted with
sharp, sawlike teeth, slanting backward.
During its stay at the Aquarium, which
probably will be for the rest of its life, it
will be." as far as la possible, fed on such
fish as it was accustomed to prey upon be
fore fts capture.

PRESIDENTS WORK
Acting as Commander-in-Chief and
as His Own Secretary
of War.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
July 4. â The War Department has re
ceived the following message from
General Otis:
MANILA, July 4.â Adjutant General,
Washington: The California Infantry
and Artillery, to the number of fourteen
hundred, and discharged men will take
the Sherman now loading at Negros for
hbme. The Warren takes the Colorado,
1100 men. I am now preparing papers. It
is difficult to lighter transports in the ty
phoon now prevailing. The Grant 1b un
loaded and in four days will take on the
Idaho, North Dakota and Wyoming, six
ty-five officers and 1500 men, with other
discharged men. s
"The President shall be the com
mander in chief of the army and navy
of the United States and of the mili
tia of the several States when called
into the actual service of the United
States."
When the President was asked by a
friend the other day why he did not
leave the details of the pending war to
hi.s subordinates and take a vacation
he replied by quoting this sentence
from the constitution of the United
States.
In further explanation he said:
"How can I take to the woods while
there is so much to be done toward
raising and looking after the army in
the Philippines and in carrying out the
obligations imposed upon me by the
constitution? It is my desire that the
army in the Philippines shall be the
best in the world, that General Otis
shall have everything he requires for
the comfort of his troops, and that
there shall be nothing lacking to bring
the campaign to a speedy and success
ful termination. I am not giving any
thought to the question of vacation
now and will not until General Otis 1 re
inforcements are well under way and
all arrangements have been made for
the return of the volunteers."
Few persons are aware of the close
personal attention which the Presi
dent gives to every detail of the Phil
ippine campaign. With the anomalous
condition of affairs existing in the War
Department because of the friction be
tween the Secretary of War and Gen
eral Miles, resulting in the army hav
ing a commanding general who does
not command and a Secretary of War
who, whatever he may have been when
the blunders were committed at the be
ginning of the war, is now a mere fig
urehead, the responsible work of or
ganizing and maintaining the army in
the Philippines falls upon the Presi
dent and Adjutant General Corbin, and
much that might be done by subordi
nates of the War Department the Pres
ident has to do himself.
There is not an order issued that he
does not have cognizance of, and he
frequently writes orders himself. He is
in the war telegraph room of the White
House many times during the day and
night, reading telegrams to and from
General Otis and studying the war map,
which is corrected every time there is
a battle or a change of troops in the
Philippines.
The wire which conveys messages
from the War Department to General
otis is, so to speak, tapped in the White
House, where every message to or from
otls is taken off for the personal infor
mation of the President. Messages
which come from General Otis at night
are frequently received and translated
in the White House and read to the
President before the officials in the War
Department know anything about
them.
So familiar has the President been
with the details of the Philippine cam
paign that he knows the location of
every regiment in the islands, and can
tell by name every volunteer regiment
that is coming home, the transport on
which it will sail, the transports which
will be available for carrying additional
troops to Manila and every detail In
connection with the organization of the
volunteers now being enlisted.
As an illustration of the care he gives
to the minutest details I was told to
day that the President had given orders
for the purchase of one additional
transport in order to make sure there
may be no delay in sending reinforce
ments to General Otis and in bringing
back the volunteers. He had been
studying a detailed list of transports
furnished by the Quartermaster's De
partment. It gave the names of avail
able transports and of the troops to go
from San Francisco and to be brought
back from Manila, with the dates on
which the regiments will sail. The ar
rangement appeared to be perfect, for
every regiment had been provided for,
but the President observed that no pro
vision had been made for possible acci
dents, and to be on the safe side at once
gave orders for one extra transport for
emergency. â¢ -
This, 1 am told, is characteristic of
the President in dealing with all the
plans of the Department of War for
caring for the Philippine army. That
the army there has been so well pro
vided and that such a large number of
troops have been sent so many miles
and many of them brought home with
out any other trouble is, I am told by
officials of the War Department, large
ly due to the foresight the President
has shown in providing for emergen
cies.
It Is said at the War Department that
the return of the volunteer organiza
tions from the Philippines will have no
effect on the rank of the volunteer gen
eral officers now on duty there. The
number of general officers depends, not
on the particular organizations in
the service, but on the total number of
men. The law provides f*>i one major
general to every 12.000 men. There will
be in the joint establishment, when the
present recruiting arrangements are
completed, about 75.000 men. There are
now three major-generals in the regu
lar establishmentâ Miles, Merritt and
Broo keâ and in the volunteers Shafter.
Otis. Lawton and McArthur. This ar
rangement will probably stand, as there
is a fraction over the quota of men for
six major-generals. There are now on
duty in the Philippines the following
brigadiers in the order of seniority
named: Bates. Young. Schwan, Hal!.
Wheaton, Grant. Hughes and Oven
shine. It is understood that these will
all retain their commands. It is not
believed the increase in the joint estab
lishment will necessitate the appoint
ment of any more brigadier-generals,
there already being a surplus in Cuba
and elsewhere who have been cared for
under the provision of the six months'
volunteer law.
Generals Funston, Smith and Hill arc.

from consideration so far as the cam
[ paign in the Philippines is concerned.

QUAI FEARS
ENEMIES IN
THE SENATE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, July 4.â A rumor
Is current in Quay circles that Gov
ernor Stone will, immediately after the
November election, call a special ses
sion of the Legislature to elect a
United States Senator. When the Gov
ernor appointed former Senator Quay
to succeed himself he had no intention
of calling the present Legislature Into
session to continue balloting for a Sen
afbr. He asserted that it would be a
useless expenditure of the State's
money to reassemble the members, be
cause there was no sign that they
could break the deadlock. Moreover,
the former Senator's friends thought he
would be seated.
Since then there have been develop
ments which have led the Quayites
to believe that an extra session of the
Legislature should be called to fill the
Senatorial vacancy. They are not
as confident as they were that he will
be given his seat as United States Sen
ator upon the appointment of the Gov
ernor. They were dismayed when they
received the Herald-Call's recent poll
of the Senate, which showed that
thirty-three are in favor of seating
Quay, thirty-one against and fifteen
doubtful, while seven could not be
reached. To secure favorable consider
ation of his case Quay would have to
secure eleven of the doubtful or miss
ing Senators, which will be a difficult
undertaking, because of the twenty
two many are inclined to the opinion
that perhaps it would be better for the
Republican party in Pennsylvania if
former Senator Quay were eliminated
from leadership in the party organiza
tion of this State.
It is admited that a large vote for
the State Republican ticket in Novem
ber may benefit the former Senators
with those Senators who have not made
up their minds yet whether it would
help the party in Pennsylvania to ad
mit him into the Senate on the ap
pointment of the Governor. With this
i condition of affairs staring th^> former
Senator in the face, it is thought it
would be better to try his chances
again with the State Legislature. His
lieutenants assert that since the for
mer Senator's acquittal of the charge
of using State funds there has been' a
change of sentiment among the so-call
ed "insurgent" members of the Legisla
ture, which they say will increase by
the time of the extra session so as t<
insure his election.
They say that an "insurgent" mem
ber of the House, representing a coun
ty adjoining Philadelphia, and twe
members from a northeastern count]
who opposed Quay, are ready to sup
port him if an extra session is called.
The greatest reason why the Quayites
wish to tho struggle for the Senat
orship by extra session if they can is
to avoid injecting Quay's candidacy In
to the election for members of the Leg
islature in 1900. Even if the former
Senator is seated it will only be until
the next Legislature elects for the full
term, and his friends fear that the
thirteen votes which he lacked in thf
last session will be still lacking in the
next Legislature and that the "insur
gents" may even be able to elect theii
candidate. ___________
