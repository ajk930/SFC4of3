"It is my judgment, after be

"Of course no formal action
of the Senate Committee has
been taken, but from expressions
of members I have no hesitancy
in saying that this monetary re

about. It is certainly legislation
that is needed.

PARIS. June 15. â The first formal
meeting: of the Venezuela Arbi-
. nation Commission opened this
nvirnine. The arbitrators, ("ini
sel and others bepan assembling
at the Foreign Office shortly before 11
o'clock. They were received by the
Minister of Foreign Affairs, M. del
Ca,sse, in the apartment in which the
tribunal will sit. These are the rooms
used at the meeting of the Spanish-
American Peace Conference and during
', the Bering Sea arbitration. 'On a raised
' dais at the end of the room, facing the
â¢ entrance are five massive gilt arm
chairs for the arbitrators, with a table
in front of them. Below the dais are
half a dozen long tables placed across
the room for counsel and the clerical
staff. A large colored map of the dis
puted territory hangs on the wall to
the right of the arbitrators, with a
! smaller map of the wholo of South
' America beside it.
Altogether there were about forty
persons connected with the tribunal
present. The arbitrators and most of
their staffs were dressed in frock coats.
There were less than a dozen spectators
in that portion of the apartment roped
, off for the general public and half a
1 dozen ladies, including Mrs. Benjamin
Harrison and others belonging to the
! American party.
The arbitrators took their seats soon
after -11 o'clock, Chief Justice Melville
X Puller and Richard Honn Collins,
j Lord Justice of_^Appeals, sitting on the
right of Professor de Martens, the um
| pire, and Baron Russell of Killowen,
Lord Chief Justice of England, and
i Justice David J. Brewer, sitting at his

Tracey and the remainder of the Amer
icans sat at the tables at the left side,
' facing the court and the British rep
resentatives were seated at tables on
' the right side. A feature of the pro
â  ceedings was that counsel used the
: desk which served during the Bering
Sea tribunal proceedings.
The proceedings opened at 11:20. when
M. del Cane briefly addressed the tri
â  bunal in French. He said it gave him
J special pleasure to welcome the High

i public, which he added was greatly

â¢ tens, who was universally acknowl
edged as an authority of international
law, he continued, the labors could only
result happily and in the interest of
' humanity, for it would constitute an
: other step toward the realization of the
noble project which, launched from an
illustrious throne, was making rapid
way into the hearts and consciences of
'â  thÂ«> people and had thus imposed itself
with singular force on the solicitude of
, those who govern them.
M. del Casse concluded with Ihankinp
the arbitrators for having accepted the
hospitality of France.
Professor de Martens rpplied. thank
ing the French Foreign Minister for his
welcome and for the hospitality ex
tended to the arbitrators. The. speaker
recalled the fact that he came here
seven years ago to attend the Bering
Sea arbitration.
Referring to the work being done- at
The Hague in the matter of arbitra
tion, he said the peace conference
sought not merely to arrange a settle
ment of conflicts but their avoidance,
and expressed the hope that the present
tribunal would have the result of pro
moting the welfare and prosperity of
the two countries interested. The pro
fessor announced the rule of procedure
agreed upon at yesterday's conference,
and said the arbitrators would meet
every day excepting Sundays. Sir
R'Vhard Webster, the British Attorney
General, thereupon rose and said that
in order to meet tho views of former
President Benjamin Harrison and the
other American counsel, in which the
English representatives concurred, he
proposed that they only meet four days
in the week in view of the extremely
heavy work before them.
Mr. Harrison said he thought there j
would be in four day*' work enough
for ordinary men, and he evoked a
smile, as looking around on the general j
gathering of the most eminent jurists
of Great Britain America, he add
ed: "And we are ordinary men." The
work before them, he added, would be
a tremendous strain upon the counsel.
Professor de Martens agreed that
four days' meeting a week would be
sufficient, arranging that the arbi
trators would not meet on Fridays.
Saturdays and Sundays.
Sir Richard Webster asked: "As the
learned Professor Martens is going back
to Th" Hague to-night, what days does
he propose to Rive us next week?"
The professor replied that he hoped
1o give them two days during the lat
ter half of next week, and that he
would write from The Hague on Sun
day, fixing the day of his arrival.
â¢ After this Sir Richard Webster an
nounced counsel had arranged that he
should speak first, then two Venezuelan
counsel, next Great Britain with pos
sibly two counsel, then Venezuela and
next Great Britain. The final speech
was to be made by Venezuela.
The British Attorney General opened
his speech by mentioning that he had
the privilege, years ago, to appear in
the same room as junior counsel in the
Bering Sea case. He was standing at
the very desk which served at that
I time. It was a significant fact that
I Venezuela was represented by distin-
I guished men of the American republic,
while America was represented on the
] bench by two Judges of the very high
| est position. It was a great ho-nor for
I himself and his colleagues to address
such a tribunal. The speaker then paid
a tribute to Professor de Martens,
whose reputation was international,
and said:
"I shall probably have to say much
with which my friends disagree, but I
am sure they will extend to us the
courtesy of forbearance, which we

that enough negroes will be imported

desire to extend to them and which is
customary between counsel in these
cases."
Continuing , Sir Richard said he only
intended to touch to-day upon the gen
eral topics underlying the whole dis
cussion, and proceeded to give a brief
geographical and historical review of
the whnlp question, going hark to the
time of Columbus. In thp course of his
remarks, he paid hp regarded the treaty
of Minister as a most important mat
ter for the tribunal, as Great Britain
claims Spain was not entitled to claim
thp whole of the Western world in view
of the f;irt that she was established in
the position of the Dutch. He pre
sumed American counsel took an en-
I tirely different view of the construction
of hoth the Munster and Utrecht treat
ies, and thought the arguments ad
vanced by American counsel were not
characterized by that breadth which
might ho expected from such eminent
gentlemen.
The representative of Great Britain
then took up the terms of the treaty
' of arbitration and laid great stress on
the British contention that there is a
: contract between Venezuela and Great
Britain and not between the Spaniards
: and the Dutch. The tribunal, he con
| tended, had to decide the boundary be
j tween Venezuela, and British Guiana at
the present time, and not between the
Spaniards and Dutch in 1814.
Counsp] said that in order to clear up
any misunderstanding he announced
that Great Britain recognized Venezu
i ela as the successor of Spain and he
submitted that the boundary, as it
might have been settled in 1814. was
not the same as ought to be denned
' to-day.
Respecting the fifty years' title
clause. Great Britain submitted that It
ought to come back from the date of
the conclusion of the treaty of arbi
tration. Counsel was adverse to hold
ing that fifty years ought to constitute
a title, whatever might be the para
' mount title of the other power, as this
â¢ would cut both ways. Where such
case was proved, the matter could be
settled in one of three ways â by de
; fleeting the boundary line with terri
torial compensation elsewhere, without
! territorial equivalent or by the pay
ment of compensation, adding that the
tribunal has absolute discretion in the
matter.
Sir Richard Webster spoke in a clear
I voice and the arbitrators and counsel
. followed his speech closely, making
; notes and occasionally asking him to

CHIGAGO, June 15.â The
Evening Journal, which
has been an ardent sup
porter of the McKinley adminis
tration, in its late issue this after
noon prints on the first page a
double leaded editorial calling
upon the President to set aside
his personal prejudices and send
General Miles to Manila to put
down Aguinaldo's rebellion and
stop the awful sacrifice of human
life now being made to the inca
pacity of some one â probably
more than one â and intimating
that ( >t is and Algcr are equally
guilty in the matter of blunder

lows:
"The President ought to make
up his mind that the administra
tion is going to crush the Fili
pino revolt, and do it soon, or
else gel out of the islands. There
seems to be a failure among his

ASSASSINATION
OF AGUINALDO
IS REPORTED
Story Reaches Manila That
the Killing of Luna Has
Been Avenged.
Soecial Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. June 15.â A copyrighted
table from Manila under date of Fri
day. June 16, says:
Aguinaldo is reported to have been
assassinated by followers of General
Antonio Luna. The news of the death
â if the Filipino gladiator was brought
to Manila by a native employe of the
Manila and Dagupan Railroad.
While it is Impossible to confirm the
report it seems based on gocrd author
ity. The assassination was the result
of the manner in which Luna lost his
life, for them now seems to be no doubt
of thp authenticity of the report that
he was killed by the guard at Apruin
aldo's headquarters on June .".
Thismorning Jose Paterno, brother of
Pedro Paterno, President of the Fili
pino Congress, showed a letter which
he had just received from Cabanatuan,
which stated that the assassination
took placp on June 5.
According to the letter Luna went to
Aguinaldo's headquarters accompanied
by his aid. Colonel Ramon. It is said
they expected to find Aguinaldo had
been put to death by assassins, accord
ing to a plan which had been made by
Luna and followers some weeks ago.
By it Aguinaldo was to be killed and
Luna placed in supreme control.
Instead, they found that Aguinaldo
had learned of their plot and as soon as
they were inside the headquarters they
were killed by the guard.
The manner in which Agulnaldo de
feated the Luna conspiracy undoubt
edly caused the followers of that cap
tain to avenge his death, and for this
reason a great many of the American
officers here believe the report. of Aguin
aldo's death brc-ught by the railway
employe is true.
Luna's death alone, if the report of
Aguinaldo's fate is not true, will un
doubtedly have a great influence upon
shorteneing the life of the insurrection.
He has been the leader of the most ir
reconcilable element among the in
surgents.
Should the report concerning Aguin
aldo be true it is believed the insurrec
tion will stop almost immediately.
Jose Paterno says his brother Pedro
is ready to return to Manila. This would
seem to signify the leaders of the in
surrection are convinced of the useless
ness of keeping up the conflict.

"Let the President summon

BRUSSELS, June 15.â 1 Interviewed
M. Andre, the Belgian Consul General
in Manila, to-day concerning the as

that Luna's death is a godsend. He
was the soul of the rebellion, the most
sanguinary, man of all Aguinaldo's
army and one who tortured Spanish
prisoners and lived by .insurrection.
Before M. Andre left Manila for his
present visit to Europe he obtained
from the Americans some concessions
for the 'Philippine insurgents in con
sideration of Luna's formal promise to
release Spanish prisoners. . Luna after

United States. An examination <.-f the
reports made by the Peace Commis
sioners shows that Colonel Arguelles,
the first Peace Commissioner sent to
Manila, came from Luna's headquar
ters, but Luna was either never really
desirous of bringing about peace or he
changed his opinion regarding the ad
vantage of a cessation of hostilities,
for he subsequently declined to per
mit Aguinaldo's commissioners to go
through his lines. After some d<-iaj^
however, they succeedt^d in reaching
Manila.
Tt is now the impression of officials
that L\ina was opposed to p^ace. In
dispatches sent to the State Depart
ment by President Schurman it has
been stated that Aguinaldo hesitated
to stop further hostilities because of
his fear of Luna and other prominent
Filipinos. With Luna, his most promi
nent rival, out of the way, and the les
son of his fate fresh in the minds of
others, it is evident that Aguinaldo will
now have his own way. and the au
thorities aro anxious to learn the road
he intends to pursue. As I have stated,
however, there are to' be no further
conferences between the Peace Commis
sioners and commissioners from Aguin
aldo unless the latter bring definite
propositions for peace.
OTIS HAS ONE
MORE MAKESHIFT
Now Trying to Get the Volunteers
to Remain In the
Philippines.
WASHINGTON. June 15.â President
McKinley has authorizr-d General Otis
to organize throe skeleton regiments
of volunteer infantry from veterans
among the volunteer organizations re
turning home and men discharged by
reason of the expiration of their terms
of enlistment. These regiments will be
rilled to their maximum by recruits to
be sent from San Francisco, so that
General Otis will have at his disposal
a fighting force of 34.354 men. 33.000 of
whom will, it is believed, be always
available.
General Otis has stated that he was
sure he could obtain a large number
' if volunteers who were willing .to re
enlist in th# new organizations. A num
ber, he thought, would return to the
United States to see relatives, but
would soon re-enlist for the Philippine
service. He has been directed to nom
inate field officers and commanding of
ficers of companies for th<>se regiments.
Most of the seventy-two lieutenants re
quired will be selected from men who
have seen service in the Philippine
campaign.
The Presidents authorization of three
volunteer regiments is generally re
garded as a drop in the bucket, and
many War Department officials insist
that he should call out all the volun
teers authorized and send them to the
Philippines to suppress the insurrec
tion.
General Otis cabled to-day the fol
lowing:
MANILA, June 15.â Adjutant General,
Washington: The success of Lawton's
tro";>s In cavite province was greater
than reported yesterday. The enemy,
numbering over 4000, lost in killed and
wounded and captured more than one
third. The remainder, much scattered,
have retreated south to Imus, their ar
senal. Of tho'.r live pieces of artillery
three vtere captured. The navy aided
greatly on ihe shore of the bay, landing
forces occasionally. The inhabitants in
that country rejoice at the deliverance
and welcome with enthusiastic demon-'
Ptrations the arrivnl of our troops.

Count Cassini Says It Will Benefit
This Country.
NEW YORK. Juno I.Vâ Count Cassini,
the Russian Embassador to this country,
at tho Waldorf-Astoria said to-night that
he would make the prediction that the
United St.itos would roap great commer
cial advantages from the. Trans-Siberian
railway.
"There aro thousands of miles of tele
graph linos there now and the prejudice
against the innovation has almost died
away. H will be the same way with the
railway. At present there is a (href
prejudice against it: but lft the natives
on<> see the benefit* nnd they will not
oppose it. Tho United States' will be a
groat gainer by the building of the new
road.
"The commerce of Russian nnd Eastern
Siberia is very small at the present time
and it will take years to develop it. The
United States, on the other hand, is already
Invading Eastern China and Siberia with
American manufactures, ami as soon as
the trans-Siberian line is running I look
to see you distance all competitors."
Speaking of tho American occupancy of
the Philippines, he. said: "We Russia in
are rather glad than otherwise: but you
are not half through with your troubles
over there yet. General Otis needs twice
as many men as he is using now.."

James Gordon Bennett.
0 HAVANA, June la.â Reports from the commissioners in charge of the pay- 85
â¢3 ment of Cuban soldiers show great discrepancies in the list submitted by the O
Â£j Cuban Assembly. Many veterans of the four years' war ippliert yesterday to S
-0 Lieutenant Colonel Bisbee at Guanajay for money, but their names -were not Â£Â»
i; on the list. They had previously delivered their arms to the Mayor, and on #
0 being refused money demanded the return of their arms. Trouble seemed gj
25 imminent, but a strong- detachment from the Seventh Cavalry was summoned 0
0 and guarded the Mayor's residence all night. V^T jB
{â¢ Bisbee came to Havana to-day and held a conference with General S
0 Brooke, who Instructed him to pay all soldiers who were identified by their 0
jj chiefs as being in the war. Similar instructions will be given to other com- cÂ«
0 missioners, and future payments will be made regardless of the Assembly 0
lÂ» list. Lieutenant Colonel Randall will begin payments at Punta on Saturday JJ
0 for soldiers of the provinces who were found not Qualified on his visit to the 0
*? towns. 53
O More than five hundred were waiting to-day for money, and the city is O
â¢^ full of soldiers of all types. They are sleeping in the parks and along' the 59
Â§ wharves. Most of them are unarmed. Those who have money are buying up H
0 old arras, and if a rifle is the only qualification for receiving money there 0

ONLY SCIENTIFIC
TAPS EXCHANGED
Chief Devery Defends
Big- Fighters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 15.â The. sittings Of
the Mazet Investigating Committee to- i
day proved interesting, and in at .least
one instance exciting, and after a squab
ble with tin- minority members over the
matter of adjournment the sessions were ;
adjourned until August 1.
Chief of Police Devery was called jpon
by Mr. Moss to explain why he first I
threatened to stop the Fitzsimmons-Jef- |
fries prize right and then went to the i
ringside and allowed it to go on to a
knockout finish. Chief Devery admitted ;
that he took an interest in prize fighting
and upheld prize righting and the Horton
law. Devery said the. recent fight com- J
plied with the law and was in all respects !
a cleancut contest.
He explained the difference between
Marquis of Queensberry and London prize
ring rules. lie would interfere, in a fight !
under the London prize ring rules, but '
there was. he said, no brutality in bouts
according to the Marquis of Queensberry
rules. He had wanted to prevent the Jef
fries-Fitzsimmons bout, but deferred to
the wishes j>t the people who took the '
opposite view.
"Did you see any heavy blows struck?"
was asked Chief Devery.
"They jarred a little. It was a clean,
scientific . contest. Neither of the men
complained that he was struck heavily."
"Was there a knockout blow?"
"That I can't say. Th* man went down.
I can't say if he was knocked out."
"You saw him knocked unconscious and
carried from the ring?"
"I did not. I saw him put in a chair,
recover immediately and shake hand*
I with his antagonist."
Mr. Moss quoted at length from news
i^ner. ..â iipi-ingi. regarding thÂ» fight, but!
the Chief stuck to his position thit under!
the law the police had no right to Inter
fere in a glove contest like that of Jef- I
1 fries and Fitzsfmmons. Asked how Jef- !
fries comes to be champion if the contest
was not a fight for the championship of
the world, the Chief said: "Under the law
he is the Horton champion."
The Chief denied that he let the Fitz- i
simmons-.TefTries contest go on because !
he was warned that if he stopped that
fight he would have to stop all others and
might thereby hurt the business of his
friend. Senator Sullivan.
"Was Fitzsimmons knocked down by
Jeffries?"
"He fell. . A little tap might" have
dropped him while he was side-stepping "
"It looked as if he fell as the result of I
a blow?"
"He might have. My personal opinion
was that the law was not violated."
Mr. Moss, still reading, referred to "two
Mows in the face that were like the kick
of a mule."
"Did you see those two blows?"
"I saw those two scientific taps." â¢
Chief Devery averred that he saw noth
ing in the law to prevent such fighting
in the future.
Chief Devery and Mr. Moss then got '
into a fierce wrangle regarding a friend I
of the Chief's and his connection with i
poolrooms, and the chairman ordered the I
Chief of Police from the committee-room I
threatening at the same time to have him I
ejected by the sergeant-at-arms. Chief
Devery left.

JAIL DOORS OPEN
FOR JAMES DIEB
Suspect Released From
Custody.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL; June 15.-James Dior,
arrested on suspicion of murdering Pete
Lorraine in Carson Canyon on May 1. was
released from custody last evening by
Sheriff Taylor and permitted to return to
his cabin on Lagunltas Creek. Dier owes
his release to the fact that the authorities
have been unable to discover Lorraine 3
body, though thay think the evidence suf
ficient to convict the suspect if the body is
ever found. Though released from Jail,
Dier is under the surveillance of Deputy
Sheriff Charles Allen and will not be per
mitted to leave Mann County.
The difficulty in finding Lorraine's body,
if the old woodchopper is really dead, is
occasioned by the late" rains. Lagunlt 13
Canyon is noted for its heavy rainfall,
and during the freshet the creek over
flowed its banks, thus; obliterating all
traces if the body was buried along the
stream. The rains also destroyed all
traces that might have existed if the body
was dragged through the underbrush.
Before his release Dier was shaved Efld
pictures taken of him in various attitudes.
These will be sent all over th. country to
discover whether or not the man is want
ed for any other crime. Shortly before^
his departure the suspect became lofiua-^
cious and related the story of hi.- life to
Sheriff Taylor and Detective Bolger.
He said he was born at Eskin, in Leeds
County, Canada, and when a young man
went to Litchfield, 111., and worked in me
car shops. From there he went to Hurt-,
Mont., then to Silver City, and finally
drifted *to Tampico, Mexico. Leaving
that place he went to Galveston, Tex.. â¢
and then to Nevada. He worked in tho
mines near Denver, C 010.,, for two years,
and then came to San Francisco. After
a while he journeyed to Topeka. Kan.,
and there patented a oar coupler, the de
sign of which was drawn by an architect
named Percy Allen. After going to Mex
ico again he returned to San Francisco,
then went to Oregon and finally returned
to work for John Erios in (/arson Canyon.
Dier has two nieces named Martin liv
ing in Jefferson County New York. He
is now 43 years old. Much of what he toM
Is contradictory. ;.'.. ..

A private conversation of M. Krantz,
Minister of War In the retiring Cabin* t
has been published here, which repre
sents him as still believing that Drey
fus is guilty. If this be the case he
is not likely to appear in the new Min
istry.
Tho Dreyfus agitation is far from
having subsided. Quarrels between
officers at Brest, where Dreyfus will
disembark, have just led to two duds,
and numerous Mayors have been sus
pended for refusing to placard the
judgment of the C urt of Cassation.
Mme. Loubet received last week
hundn ds of anonymous threatening
letters, written on superfine pa] er in
elegant penmanship. Some of these
were menacing. The writers threatened
that if she accompanied her husband
to the Grand Prix sh" would return -.'.
widow. The moderate republicans in
the Senate intend to introduce a bill
assimilating the President of the re
public to foreign sovereigns. This
would render persons insulting him
liable to prosecution before the cor
rectional chamber.
THE ENEMIES OF
DREYFUS ACTIVE
NEW YORK. June 15.â A special
cable to the Sun from Paris says: It is
daily becoming evident that there is
much ferment in military circles. This
is demonstrated by several recent or
ders Of the day issued to troops by
their commanders. Consequently the
new Government will probably find it
necessary to adopt severe disciplinary
measures.
The anti-revisionist press daily grows
bolder in expressing the opinion that
the new court-martial will condemn
Dreyfus and is simultaneously seeking
to warp the judgment of the prisoner's
future judges by appeals to them to
protect the honor of the army.
Rennes, the town where the court
martial will sit. is already in a state
of great agitation and everything in
dicates that there will be considerable
turbulence during the trial. The au
thorities, realizing the danger, are
taking extensive measures for the pre
servation of order.
The newspaper, Droits de I'Homme,
publishes an alleged statement from M.
Krantz, retiring Minister of War, to
the effect that his experience In tlv
war office had not altered his opinion
of the Dreyfus case. He was convinced
that both Dreyfus and Colonel Picquart
were guilty.
DECISION RELATING
TO HOP CONTRACTS
judge Davis' Final Ruling in Suits
That Have Interested All Grow
ers in the State.
MARYSVIL.LJ3, June Ls.â ln the Supe

tracts made between the ilrni of Meblua

i;r"s. for delivery of the hops raised on
the latters' farm near Wheatland for Qve
years, beginning in '.^i'.. which contracts
wen asigned to E. C. Horst of San Fran
cisco by the Roddans. Horst, who has al
ready confessed a liability of $60,000 on the
deal." is most affected by the decision.
The court holds that while the contracts
were assignable, the defendants were
guilty of a breach of the contracts by
their refusal to allow an inspection of the
hop <rop by Mebius & Drescher on the
farm. The plaintiff is awarded commis
sions on the bonus contracts of January
and March of imÂ»7 and nominal damages
in the sum of ?1 on the preference con
tracts of the same yeai ; also damages for
t! ; . breach of the contract of lye,. No
damages are- allow â ! the defendants on
their counter claim. Plaintiffs are denied
attorneys' fees, but ll is held that the
trust.es are entitled to lawful disburse
ments.
The court holds that 19.000 pounds of
hops delivered by the growers, the Rod
dans, to plaintiff. Drescher, were delivered
under the I V !'L' contraiii and no; under the
ls'.C contract, ami M was decreed that the
market price of hops in lh9T was 1! cents

These suits, which were tried early this
year, attracted considerable attention

PETRULEUM AS FUEL
Successful Test Made With a Valley-
Road Engine.
STOCKTON, June lii.-- A test of tho
steam-producing qualities <>f petroleum
was made this afternoon on engine 102 of
the Valley branch of the Santa Pc road.
The employe* of the roundhouse here
have been engaged for some time in fit
ting i-p the engine with the necessary
fixtures for burning petroleum. The
burner used is long and narrow. Heat
-tnd flames are blown under the boilers by
a current of steam, which is secured Â"t
first by heating the boilers with w l.
Then the petroleum is started and n
erates the strain. The test this after
noon was fairly satisfactory, and it is ex
pected that eventually a number of tha
Valley engines will bo fitted up to use
this class of fuel, which comes cheaper
than either wood or coal.

Miss Bertola of Mills College moved

News Comes That Will Greatly Aid
in Hastening the Govern

LOS ANGELES. June 15.â J. W. Wyck
<>ff, general manager <>f the Government
breakwater ai San Pedro, and represen
tative nf Mrs. Peter w. Neu of Chicago,
says the keel for the fourth scow t<> be
used for rock dumping was laid at San
Pedro to-day. The third scow will be
completed by July 1, while two boats
have for some time been in commission.
The two bcows now used ouch have a ca
pacity of 77.", tons of rock. The new boata
will be able to carry 1500 tons at a load.
The contractors nave Beventy-flve men
employed in their quarries, and forty in

will be In full swing by August 1. whin
!7.", Tiifii will work in the quarries.
Two BCOW loads of rock an- hein^

tinder full headway, two loads will be
dumped each day. AYhere it now takes
three or four days to load a biu-tfe with
working material' for the proposed break

lie accomplished in as many hours. The
many obstacles that have been encoun

PASSING SPURIOUS CHECKS.
A Young Fresno Man Obtains Money
Under False Pretenses.
STOCKTON, June 15.â Complaint was
made to the police this afternoon thai
Harry N. Nickson, a young man well
known In Fresno, was obtaining money
under false pretenses by means of worth
less checks. He worked off one check
purporting to have been signed by H. D.
Stevens, and all told is supposed to have
cleaned up about $200 within a few days.
It is said that he used bogus names on
most of the checks. The fraud was not
discovered until after Nickson had left
town. He is said to be well connected
and to be Interested In an estate which
pays him a fair monthly dividend.
Drowned in the Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, June I~>.â A 7-year-oW
boy named [vice, the son of a widow llv-
Ing near the river in the outskirts of the
city, was drowned to-day while bathing

kind this season, but every summer a
number of hoys are drowned owing to the
treacherous nature of the currents caused
by steep sand banks in the channel.

serve early records and traditions of
the aborigines and Spanish, to care for
precious relics and colled data for his
tory. She urged that memorial tablets
be made and placed on spots sanctified
by heruic deeds or made famous by his
torical incidents. She referred to how
the Eastern states marked every spot
of interest by tablets and monuments,
and urged thai ea< h parlor pi ant a trey
that would grow and flourish long af
ter the members had passed away.
Each parlor should have a historian.
a museum. There should be a chair of
California history in the university.
Stnte pride should be fostered |jy State
s<inps, State literature and flowers.
The remarks were well received, and
some of thÂ»- suggestions will probably
be favorably acted upon by the parlor.
The parlor did not reach the election of
grand officers to-day. c,,ra B. Slfford
will undoubtedly be chosen grand pres
ident to-morrow. There is considerable
good-natured nvalrj for some of the
offices, but all electioneering is betas
done in the most friendly spirit. There
was much indignation to-day over the
tenor of reports made by a local paper,
which sought to make It appear that
personalities were being indulged in by
some of the friends of those mentioned
for Grand Parlor offices. As Mrs.
Sifford is now grand vice president the
unwritten rules of the order remove
the grand presidency from any contest.
Th" chief interest centers in the elec
tion of her successor, who will be either
Mrs. Maker or -Mrs. Cett. There are
many amendments and additions to the
ritual which have been proposed and
which must be disposed of before ad
journment.
The delegates will have to work hard
to-morrow to finish, but there is no rule
to prevent the parlor continuing the
session the following day if there Is
business demanding attention remain
ing at the end of the stated sessions.
An effort is being made to do a was
with the requirement that the constitu*
tion and by-laws be read at each par
lor meeting. Tlip question of time con
sumed in reading is being urged against
the present provision. It is probable
that if this obligation is not eliminated
entirely provision will be made for the
reading only at stated intervals.
It has been decided that no individ
ual member can purchase a copy of the
ritual unless the same is a110w,.,] ),,
remain in the possession of the presi
dent of the parlor. It was also an
nounced that candidates for admission
to the order need not join the parlor
CONTRACT TO BUILD A
RAILRCAD IN MEXICO
Rich Concessions Made to H. R.
Yerxa and J. M. Neeland of
Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, June 15.â H. R.
Yerxa ami J. M. Neeland, to whom the
Mexican Government has Kranted im
portant concessions, will at once begin
the constructiim of a railroad from Cor
doba, in the State of Wra Cruz, to the
isthmus of Tehuantepoc, have reached
their homes in this city. When seen
Mr. Xeeland said:
"Instead of being a concession, it is
a contract that we have made. Alfred
Bishop Mason Of New York has the
concession and is the owner of the
road. The road is to tie about 350 miles
long. It will run through the richest
par! of Mexico from Cordoba, in the
State of Vera Cruz, through the State
of Oaxaca, down the isthmus of Te
huantepec to Balina Cruz-, on the Pa
ciflc Coast. The road, will run through
lands rich in coffee, bananas, cocoa
nuts, pineapple plantations, sugar cane
and rubber forests.
The locality which will he tapped by
th<- railroad is the home of the vanila
bean industry. It is also from this
vicinity that all chicle comes that is
used in the manufacture of gum. The
Mexican Government ha? promised to
furnish 1000 men, and we contemplate
sending to the island of Jamaica for a
cargo of negroes. According to the
contract we must begin work July 1,
and have the work completed in two
years. It will be of standard gauge and
will probably cost $15,000,000. We an
ticipate buying a large portion of our
foreign supplies in I-os Angeles. The
cash for the first 100 kilometers, about
$2,000,000, has already been deposited in
the City of Mexico. Of this amount
$500,000 is in gold. The Government will
pay us a subsidy of $14,000 in Govern
ment bonds for each kilometer con
structed and the road will revert to
the Government at the end of ninety
nine years."
The Storke Libel Case.
SAXTA BARBARA. June 15.â The pros
ecution in the Yda Addis Storke libel case
after two days' examination of F. M.
Gutierrez, whom they claimed It would

letters to Dr. Martha Case, failed to es
tablish anything. The hearing of the tes
timony will probably be concluded to
morrow.

lor may accept eligible tpembers from
any part of the State. The question
of the time of installation of officers of
subordinate parlors has been settled by
f.xin;; tlv time in itll parlors for the.
months of January and July.
There is a movemeni on foot looking
to the establishment of a scholarship
in the State University for those Na
tive Daughters who may desire to tak*>
a post graduate course. The question
has not been formally brought up y.et,
but probably will before the session
ends, as it has many warm advocates
and i; is believed the necessary fund
could be secured.
In answer to h question the parlor
has decided that the grand president is ,
entitled to district the State as she sees
fit and appoint deputies accordingly.
The delegates had a rest this evening,
it being the first one since the Bess-ion
licÃan. To-morrow evening Stockton
Parlor No. 7. Native Sons, will render .
the visitors a irnll and reception. The
affair will take place at Agricultural
Pavilion, which is being elaborately
decorated for the occasion.
The nominations of officers In the
Grand Parlor of the Native Daughters ;
was completed to-night and the election i
will be on before thie parlor to-morrow
morning in good earnest. The nomina

BUSY IN THEIR ORCHARDS.
So the Fruit Men Could Not Attend
the Lodi Meeting.
T.OPT, June 15.â The fruit growers'
meeting, scheduled for yesterday after
noon, did not come off, hence the local
growers' union was not organized. The
president and secretary prepared for busi
ness, but there was not a sufficient num
ber of fruit men present to constitute a
quorum and the meeting was declared off.
Why such a lack of interest was shown
after the enthusiasm of last week when
the State organizers were in town is a
mystery which the local officers are un
able to explain. Probably the absence of
growers was accounted for because of
the fact that just now they are in the
midst of a very busy season and can find
little or no time for anything outside of
their orchards. At the meeting yesterday
delegates were to be elected to the State j
Fruit Growers' Association whic.h meets
in Sacramento on Saturday. However, .
nothing could be done in that line, and if
the local fruit men are represented there i
it must be individually. It looks doubt- ,
ful now regarding the fq_rmatlon of a
local growers' union. No date has been \
set for another meeting- [

Through the Closing of Mines and

DENVER, June 15.â Thirty thousand j
men in Colorado will be out of work
within the next three days unless steps .
are taken to end the strike of the smel
ter employes. The Omaha and Grant
and the Globe in Denver, the Bimetal- j
lie and the Arkansas Valley at Lead- i
ville, the Eilers and the Colorado smelt- {
ers at Pueblo are closed. The Argo !
smelter in Denver has complied with
the eight-hour law and is still running, j
The Guggenheim smelter at Pueblo also
is running. The closed works are un
der guard, but nowhere have the men
made any demonstration.
At Central City the men employed in
the stamp mills are soon expected to
strike. These mines have already
closed: The Commodore, Amethyst.
Bachelor, Bachelor No. 2 and Last
Chance mines, in the Creede district;
the Calliope and Hagerty at Ouray; the
Caribbean and Montezuma, near Opnir;
the Iron Mask and Black Iron at lieu
Cliff; the Smuggler at Aspen. Tin-
Porter Fuel Company at Durango has
closed, throwing lr>o m>>n out of work.
From all parts of the State conic re
ports that mines are reducing forces.
At Lead ville HOO men have been dis
charged, and in view of the orders Lo
ship no more ore t" the closed smeltrrs,
little except development work i= g â . â -
ing on. The loss in wages to the men
at Durango by the twelve Gays' close
of the smelter is $50,000.
Should the mines close all over the
State 5000 railroad men will be thrown
out of employment.
Four mines of the Colorado Fuel and
Iron Company, three near Canyon City
and one in Pitkin County, have been
shut down on account of wage differ
ences.
"1 he real crux of the situation seems
to be with the trust and its employes,"
said Governor Thomas to-day. "The
mines will have n<> trouble if they can
dispose of their products; they must
suspend because their market is af
fected. The men in charge of the trust
plants in Colorado have always been
public-spirited and progressive, and if
they refuse to participate in the effort
to remove the pending embargo upon
our prosperity it will ho because they
have in i discretion in the premises. The
men they have heretofore employed will
not decline to occupy middle ground
with their t-mployei's. for they are doing
so at Argo and in Pueblo. The public
have a tremendous interest in the con
troversy, and they should insist upon
a speedy and peaci ful compromise."
Governor Thomas said that there ran
be no good reason why the eipht-hour
law should not be tested without delay,
and he added that the people will ac
quiesce in the decision of t^e murtc
HAVEMEYER'S SLAP AT
LABOR ORGANIZATIONS
His Remarks Expunged From the
Record, but the Words Are
Not Forgotten.
WASHINGTON, June 15.â Mr. Have
meyer's attack on labor organizations
will be expunged from the records of
the Industrial Commission at his own
request. That part which was calcu
lated to give the greatest offense to
labor was the paragraph in which hr
expressed the conviction that associa
tions of workingmen tended to degrade
labor by destroying Individual Inde
pendence. He realized he had been Im
prudent by giving utterance to th>
theory and candidly said he wished he
had not gone into the subject. Although
that section of Havemeyer's testimony
will not be in the official record it will
not be lost, for a dozen stenc-graphers
were there to send it broadcast.
Mr. Havemeyer is apparently in favor
of organization in everything except la
bor. He thinks workingmen's organiza
tions arc bad because they destroy in
dividuality, yet in another part of his
testimony he blurted out the expres
sion "the day of the individual is
passed," meaning that affairs of the
world are to be hereafter controlled ny
combinations.
This phrase of Mr. Havemeyer will
be remembered as long as the remark
of the late William H. Vanderbilt, "The
public be d d!" It will form the text
for thousands of editorials and cam
paign speeches.

GHOULISH WAR
Strife of Coroner and
Undertakers.
RENEWED AFTER A MURDER
STRUGGLE FOB, THE BODY OF
THE SLAIN CHILD WIFE.
Complaints Against E. H. Bresee and
E. M. Shafer for Obstructing
an Officer in Discharge
of His Duty.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. June 15.-ThÂ», strife be
tween Coroner Holland and Bresee Bros.,
undertakers, regarding the disposition of
bodies in Coroner cases came this after
noon to an acute stage when Dr. Hollan-.l
swore out complaints charging E. H.
Bresee and E. M. Shafer with obstructing
an officer in the discharge of his duty
under the provisions of section 44s of the
Penal Code.
The present contention involves the body
of Georgie Elliott Hanchette, the girl
wife, who ;rt an early hour yesterday was
murdered at the Columbia lodging house
by her husband, Karl Hanchi tte.
Shortly afier the girl-wife died of her
wounds Bresee appeared on the scene
armed with the authority of an order from
E. H. Griffith, a relative of the dead girl,
and removed the body In his d< ad-wagon.
When the Coronei went to make his of
ficial investigation the body was gone. He
was referred to the Bresefl undertaking
parlors.
Then it was that the anger of Dr. Hol
land rose In its might, and in his wrath
be refused to ho let the inquest at the
Bresee place. He later went to Bresee'a
with his jury and viewed the remains,
after which he adjourned to the under
taking rooms of C. 1). Howry, who. since
Dr. Holland's regime, dating January i,
has apparently enjoyed the greater share
of Holland's patronage.
After the intjuest was completed. Cor
oner Holland laid the matter before the
District Attorney. This disgusting exhi
bition in a .struggle with ghoulish fiend
ishness to gain 'control of inanimate clay
for commeneial results has arisen owing
to the lack of a public morgue, while
the war has been on since early in Janu
ary. It is an open secretâ so open as to
be no secret at all â that politics is under
the whole affair. The county corpse busi
ness is a profitable one for the undertak
ers, and during the last campaign Dr.
Holland received the support of C. I).
Howry and R. a. Garrett, undertakers,
on the understanding that once In office
his patronage was to be turned their way.
Dr. Holland tried to live up to the pledge
in good faith, but Bresee and opposing
undertakers frequently prevented. Time
and again, with the authority of friends
and relatives of the deceased, bodies that
\ver<- the object of official investigation
were removed to other establishments.
notwithstanding the furious objections
that always came from Dr. Holland, who
contends that bodies of persons who die
bj violence or under suspicious circum
stances ar<j not t" be interfered with
after discovery withou-: his authority.
The inquest over the remains was held
and a verdict that death resulted from
a gunshot wound Inflicted by Karl Han
chette with murderous intent was re
turned. Hanchette Is still alive, though
ho shot himself through the abdomen,
and may recover.
CONTEST OVER AN
EXCHANGE OF LANDS
Mountain . CniUlPr Cnmpany'o Solon-

Act of Congress.
REDDING, June 15.â The Mountain

other lands selected in lieu thereof.
These tracts, owned by the Central Pa

TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. June 15.â
The Industrial Commission held only an
afternoon sesaion and heard but one wit
ness to-day, J. N. Jarvie, of the firm of
Arbuekli & Bro., manager of the firm's
. refining business. Mr. Jarvle's tes
timony was brief. He was easy anri cour

He explained the entrance of the Ar
bui kles Into the sugar field by Baying that
in 1893 tlu y secured a machine for w.-^h
inp and packing su^;.r and undertook to
:,'k::^>- sugar to the wholesale trade.
They bought from the American Refining
Company, but found they could make ri â¢ >
profit In that way, and so started their
own retlnery. He said the tariff differen

Mr. Jarvie said, there had been siany
overtures from th>- BUgar trust to s<
the difflcultiea with the Arbuckles, but
they had ail ii*-.'!i made "for stock-job

had been nothing in them.

when the one big concern decided to !><â

the business in the country.
When asked how long Â»h"Â» rival com
pany could keep on selling sugar at a
loss, Mr. Jarvie replied cheerfully that !
he thought a concern supplying :Â»0 per

would lose more under those conditions !
than the firm supplying the other 10 per !

liceman Premeditated.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVADA, June 15.â This was a bad
day for the self-defense plea of Police
man FCllroy's slayer. After County Coro
ner Daniels had Identified the riddled and
blood-stained clothing that the officer had
on when killed, Gustave .Schmidt, a to
bacconist, was Called. Schmidt testified
that Moore came Into his store a fort
night before thr- tragedy and said If Kii
roy did not o,uit following and threaten
ing to arrest him be would kill him.
Lyman B. Weeks, a miner, and J. .j.
Hani.;., who tends bar at the Grotto mi -
lv.in. had the same remark trade t.> them
bj the prisoner. Robert Walker, a clerk
in the Union Hotel, heard Moore make
the same threat to Kilroy himself one
.. vi ning.
Fred Eilerman, a saloon keeper, said
that ai>out a quarter of an hour before
the killing he heard Kilroy tell Moore
he lied when he denied leaving the sa
loon blinds open so the officer could in
pursuit of his duties watch the Interior
oi the saloon, and Moore- replied, "I will
shoot you. Kilroy; you have followed mo
l.mtf enough." Kilroy was carrying a
.-tine ,v the time, but apparently paid no
attention when the threat to shoot was
made.
Barber Bob Gates, the only witness of
the whoi-e affray, testified that the two
men went down Broad street to Pine,
upon leaving Eilerman'S, talking and ar
guing. At the confer both sin. we, i exclte
m< nt. Moore repeated the statement that
Kilroy date not arrest him, and that he
would be killed If he tried it. Kilroy re
plied that -he could, but did not want to
arrest him, and that Moon could not
kill him. After a while Kilroy put his
hands on the obstreperous man's shoul
ders from in front and leaned forward
as if t" Bhoul in his car. Moore being
hard of hearing. Then Moore dr< w his
gun and shot Kilroy twice in the stO-
I. The wounded man fell against the
assassin and the force of the blow
knocked the latter on his back. Moore
sprang up and pressing his pistol against
the face of the wounded man, who was
still on his knees anil calling "Oh, Bob,
come here'," fired again, then turned and
Bed from the corpse. Once Gates heard
i ne .f the men say. "Keep away, I don't
want any trouble," but he could not tell
which Bald it.
Printers Morgan and Bnardman of the
Herald force were upstairs in the office,

John S. Gregory, E. W. Schmidt and
others saw the body just after the shoot-

Tuttle claimed to be a cousin of Oscar l!
Tut tie, a baseball magnate, and now it
turns out that the former Is the Litter's
own father. L. P. Tuttle arrived to-day
from San Francisco, and his meeting- with
the son was a happy one. It is said the
reason -he introduced himself as a cousin
was because he feared disappointment
and wanted time for further investigation
which convinced him at last he had
found his son. The father its in the em
ploy of Main & Winchester, San Fran
cisco. He had been a visitor at Santa
Cruz for ten years without any idea that
O. L. Tuttle was his son.
ICE BREAKS UP
ON THE YUKON
Steamer New York Al
most Destroyed.
NEWS COMES FROM DAWSON
MANY ACCIDENTS TO MINERS
ARE REPORTED.
Some New Finds in the Rica Klon
dike Cause Great Activity and
Revival of Excite
ment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Wash., June 15.â The! first
news from the interior of Alaska to be re
ceived since travel over the trail closed
about six weeks ago reached here to-day.
It covers the -period between the big fire
at Dawson, April 26, and the opening of
navigation, May 25. A revised estimate
of the losses incurred in the fire places
the total amount at half a million, about
half the amount of previous estimates.
The Yukon broke away from its icy
fetters in front of Dawson, May 7, or
nine days later than last year. The
steamer New York was carried ashore by
the ice and nearly destroyed. The Wheel
of the Willie Irving was crushed. The
ice jammed at the foot of Third street,
and blocks of ice were piled up mountain
high. For a time Dawson was threatened
with a Hood. After a short time the ice
broke with a crash and every one knew
that the river was open for good. The
breaking of the ice marked the graduation
of the Cheecharkos or tenderfeet Into
the ranks of the sour doughs or old tim
ers. The event was celebrated with the
firing of guns and a general rejoicing.
The Flora was the first steamer to ar
rive from the outside. She was followed
in a few hours by the Bonanza King. Re
ports had been received from all the
creeks and everything was satisfactory.
There was no evidence of a shortage of
water, which caused so much trouble last
year.
On Bonanza and El Dorado hundreds of
men were at work sluicing out gold. The
benches are showing up well. Some enor
mous dumps of gravel were made during
the winter. These are now being washed
out and are panning much better than
was expected.
Dominion and other creeks on Indian
River are also being cleaned up with more
than satisfactory results. A great deal
of summer work will be done this year
on El Dorado if the How of water will
permit.
Work is going on night and day on
many of the big claims. The Berrvs are
working three shifts. They will be among
the first of the big owners to complete
the clean-up. There have been a num
ber of sales during the past two months
and prices have held up wonderfully well.
A large number of big and peculiar nug
gets have been found; one valued at $142
was recently taken from 32 below Upper
Dominion.
The first week in May saw the com
mencement of the collection of the crown
royalty of 10 per cent. Every effort is
being made to compel the miners to pay
up the full percentage.
The list of mining accidents is unus
ually long. Frank Julbertl was crushed
to death on May 22 by a cave-in on claim
17. below Bonanza on Maget Gulch. His
partner, Cesarra Pusatti, was badly in
jured. L. Avrie of St. Louis. Mo., was
suffocated by gas in his shaft on claim
77. Gold Run. A German named Helhl of
San Francisco was suffocated in his shaft
near the Cliff House on Gold Run. An
drew Nelson had a narrow escape from
death in a shaft on "A below on Upper
Dominion. Ho was taken out uncon
scious.
A miner In a Gold Hill shrift bocamÂ«
almost suffocated rrom gas; He signaled
bio partner to pull him to the surface.
He just reached the top when he swooned
and fell back into the hole head lirst.
It was forty feet to the bottom and death
would have been sure had not a spike
caught In his trousers and held him. be
only falling a few feet.
There ha.ye been a number of narrow
escapes from drowning in the Yukon by
luckless parties attempting to cross on
thin Ice.
Gilbert Anderson <>f T.,a Crosse, Wis.,
has reached the city after a most excit
ing 'riji from the Copper River country
through the dead of winter. He brings
news of the safety of a large party of
miners who started over the divide into
the Tanana country and were believed I >
I ;ivi been lost. Anderson says thai om
.'!â  two of the party were frozen In the
mountains, but that the majority are
building boats on Forty-mile Rivi r I i
continue their journey. He does not giw*
the names of those who perished.
The climax In Dawson's water front
controversy occurred mi May 16. The ten
ants who would not obey Government
warnings to sign leases or vacate were
summarily ejected by a land of police
under Sheriff Harper.
E. C. Alien, one of the proprietors of
the Klondike Nugget, -is being tri.-.i on
the charge of criminally libeiiner United
States < Consul Mr-t ook.
Joe Juneau, one of the pioneers of the
Yukon, after whom the town of Juneau
was named, died at Dawaon Mny is of
pneumonia. He made and lost several
fortunes In Alaska.
Arnold Bresmef of Seattle w;is killed
May 17 by a fellow workman In the Daw
son brewery. William Doggett. They
quarreled and Doggett hit Bresmer oh
the head with a beer bottle, infliotine
fatal injuries.
A deposit of limestone has been found
near Sixty-mile, and DawÃon people are
rejoicing over the possibility of having
plenty of disinfectant. After an exciting
trial before Gold Commissioner Ogllvie
Messrs. Wad.. McGregor and Norwood

THE WHEAT CROP
OF THE WORLD
Report on Condition of
Foreign Fields.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 15.â The Agricul
tural Department to-day issued a circular
giving the substance of reports received
by it'' up to June 10 on the condition of
foreign crops. It says that a British com
mercial estimate tentatively puts, the
world's wheat crop of 1899 at 2,504.000.000
bushels, against 2,748,000,000 bushels in 1893,
a reduction of 244,000,000 bushels, or nearly
8.9 per cent. Another estimate makes a
reduction of 352,000,000 bushels.
Reports from the country around Odessa
and Nikolaeiff, Russia, represent the grain
crops, both wheat and rye. as almost de
stroyed by drought. Taking into account
the injuries hereafter reported In three
or four other provinces within the winter
wheat region, it is evident that the crop
of bread grain for the empire as a whole
cannot be agreed upon. It has even been
suggested that the crop may not exceed
that of 1897.
Information from Germany is scant, but
there has been complaint of deficient sun-
Shine and warmth, and the harvest was
thought lucky to be a week or two later
than usual. Later advices Indicate better
weather in various parts of Germany.
According to the official report^ on the
Austrian crop, the middle of May. wheat
and barley promised about a? average
yield, but rye and oats were below that

crop would be, in round numbers, about

In Great Britain there has been consider

weather, but except in Denmark and Swe
den there is no mention of any serious m

DEMOCRATS ARE
FINALLY AGREED
Pennsylvania Conven
tion Fills Its Ticket.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HARRISBURG, Pa., June 15.â The
contest before the Democratic State
convention for Supreme Court Judge
ended this evening with the unanimous
nomination of Judge S. L. Mestrezat of
Fayette County, on the twenty-eighth
ballot. Charles J. Reilly of Williams
port, permanent chairman or the con
vention, was nominated by acclamation
for Judge of the Superior Court, and
Representative William T. Creasy of
Columbia was the unanimous choice for
State Treasurer. After making these
nominations the convention adjourned.
The convention started to ballot at 6
o'clock last evening for Supreme Judge
and continued with a few recesses un
til 6 o'clock to-night. . York County
started the break to Mestrezat on the
twenty-eighth ballot by casting its
thirteen votes for him. Before the vote
was announced Congressman Erman
trout withdrew the nineteen votes of
Berks, cast for Judge Errnentrout, and
gave them to Mestrezat. Mr. Donnelly
of Philadelphia gave the sixty votes of
Philadelphia solidly to Mestrezat. Cen
ter County changed from Krebs to Mes
trezat.
Ex-Congressman Kerr of Clearfield,
who had managed Krebs' contest, with
drew his candidate for Mestrezat. This
insured the latter'? nomination and
there was a wild scene of enthusiasm.
Judge Mestrezat's nomination was
made unanimous. When the convention
again settled . down to business the
names of Representative George R.
Dixc-n of Elk and Mr. Reilly were pre
sented for Superior Judge. General A.
H. Coffroth of Somerset withdrew Mr.
Dixon's name, and on his motion Mr
Reilly was nominated by acclamation.
The convention then completed the
ticket by the nomination of Mr. Creasy
for State Treasurer, his name having
been placed before the convention by
his colleague, Mr. Dixon.
The nomination for Supreme Court
Judge is equivalent to an election, by
reason of the fact that two are to- be
elected in November and no elector is
entitled to vote for more than one
SAYS MADERA HAS
BEEN TREATED RIGHT
Griffin Explains the Southern Pa

Coppev Smelter.
MADERA, Juno 15.-A misapprehension
of the facts in regard to the locating of
the smelter of the California Copper
Company seems to have possessed your
correspondent at Madera. The citizens
of Mad. ra feel that the Southern Pacific
Company has treated Mad era right at all
times in this matter, and the people feel
grateful for the courtesies shown us by
the Southern Pacific Company's represen
tative, S. F. Jtooth. The site now under
consideration on the north hank of the
San Joaquin River may not be consid
ered as desirable as that offered by the
citizens. The matter will be settled on
the arrival from New York of the copper
company's engineer, who is expected in 'i

GETS SPECIAL LETTERS.
Mrs. Phelps Looking After Her De-
ceased Husband's Estate.
REDWOOD CITY. June 15.â Upon the
application of Mrs. Josephine Phelps, the
wl.low of the late Timothy Guy Phelps.
special letters of administration were to
day granted to her. The application for
special letters was made for the purpose
of t.-tting an order of court allowing the
administratrix access to the box of tHe
deceased in the safe deposit in San Fran
cisco, where he kept his papers and docu
ments.
Although a will exreuted by Mr. Phelps
has been Found hearing date of Decem
ber 24, 1892, it la thought th:.i possibly
there- is in existence a will of later date
and if such be the case it will probably
be found among his papers in the safe de
posit. If such a will is found of course
that will be the one to be probated. Mrs
Phelps was appointed for the purpose of
making this search and caring for the rs
tate of the dec-eased in the meantime
bonds being tixed in the sum or $500.

STRIKING MINERS
VERY INDIGNANT
Demand a Retraction of
a False Story.
THEY ARE NOT CRIMINALS
THOSE WHO QUIT WORK SET
FORTH THEIR GRIEVANCES.
They Demand Better Pay for Work at
Iron Mountain and Food That
Is Fit for Human
Beings.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, June 15.â The striking: Iron
Mountain miners, now in Redding, were
made Indignant to-day l>y the fncendiary
dispatcb from Sacramento, which was
printed In Wednesday evening's Bulletin.
The Built tin wan soundly denounced for
stating that "nearly 30 per cent of the
men employed at the works have at some
time done time in the State prison?." and
thai "they are a class of men who hold
life lightly." y
The Sacramento dispatch was posted on "^
a bulletin board near the postoffl.-e, and
underneath it on a Western Union blank
was a demand signed by "striker?" that
the grossly libelous matter be retracted.
The Bulletin was favored with a red-hot
copy by wire.
A committee of strikers composed of W.
Graham, < '. H. Beeve and W. H. Day, in.
behalf of their fellow-workmen, to-day Is
sued an address to the public, in which is
recited the grievances which led up I
present trouble. In part the address reads:
on .Tune 1" a grievance committee of twelve
men watted upon Superintendent Archer and
asked for, In behalf of the employes i
corporation, a uniform increase of 40 cents in
ail branches of tl><> mininp business. At the
present time miners are receiving $2 60 a diy.
and Â» lie lower grade? of workmanship from
$2 1" a day. which, In our opinion. Is
considerably l>cl<>w the average schedule In
force on similar properties in this am) other
[arts of the State. We believe our course is
a just one, and desire to inform the mining
public to thnt effpet.
The strikers also complain of the com
pany's boarding-houses, asserting that
"the food Is not fit fur human consump
tion." but that the employes are com
pelled to patronize the institution under
penalty of discharge. The address states
that of the 500 men who quit work only
two were opposed to the move, and re
mained with the company. Tbeir names
are Charles Smiley and one McDroom. All
stories sen) out to the effect that grave
complications are feared, necessitating
the calling out of the militia, are without
foundation, as all "f the strikers have.
left the vicinity of the property and are
red'in town, from which the mino
is not readily accessible.
Further evidence of the peapceable na- I
ture of the strike is found in the fact that f
an extra coach had to be switched into
the overland train lust idpht to accom
modate the strikers who were bound for
Colorado and for British Columbia by
way of Pan Francisco. Over a hundn d
men have left for other fields and mnro
are poinK. There is no disturbance here,
at Keswick or Iron Mountain. Xo at
tempt is beinp made (o reopen the mine
It is piven out. however, that Superin
tend, nt Archer will have some Iraprove-
I ments made in the mine for the better
ment of the air supply, the w>rk to be let
out by contract.
It was rumored about that ihe company
had mad.' an offer of $3 per day for Ihe
miners to go to work, but no ere
is placed in the story here.
KEPT HIS VOW,
BUT LOST HIS LIFE
A Drunkard Promises Never to Touch
Liquor Again and Sticks to It
to the End.
CHATTANOOGA, Term., June in.â "if it
takes whisky to save my life I'll die," said
Marion J. Smith, a well known local char
acter, last night. He kept his word and
died early this morning.
Smith had been a notorious drunkard
for twenty years. He had been on a spr c
for the past live weeks. His wife had
pleaded in vain for him to join thf> church
and quit drinking. Last Sunday Smith
attended a tent meeting drunk. The
evangelist scored drunkenness, and at the
close of the service Smith went forward
put a quart bottle of whisky into the
preacher's hands ami vowed never to
touch liquor while he lived. He kept pra> -
ing continuously and last night was taken
violently ill. A physician pr< scribed whis
ky, but he refused to touch a drop al
though his wife pleaued with him to take
it. He died in horrible agony, refusing to
touch liquor.
GOVERNORS NOT INTERESTED.
Some Will Not Participate in Anti-
Trust Convention.
AUSTIN. Tex.. June 15.â T0-day Gover
nor Savers received a letter from Gov
ernor Dyer of Rhode Island relative to
the proposed anti-trust convention in St.
Louis on the 20th of September. Governor
Dyer writes that he will not be present
at the meeting; that the question ..f
trusts and the damage they are cioing tha
country was our to which ho paid little
attention. He was not prepared to say
that they were doing harm, neither wag
he prepared to say that they were doing
good. In view of this fact", he did not
care to attend a convention and bind him
self to oppose trusts when later he might
line' that they were a benefit to the
people.
Governor Roosevelt of New York also
wrote to the Governor stating that whilf*
he indorsed the movement, he could not

World.
.â â â¢--:. --
The pupils Of the Hamilton Evening
School held their annual graduating ex
erclses last night In the auditorium of the
Girls' High School. The exercises were
"exceptionally interesting and the enthu
siasm of the pupils and their relatives
and friends, who taxed the spacious audi
torium to its utmost capacity, ran high.
Mayor Phelan attended the graduating :
exercises and favored the audience with;
an address.
Congressman Julius Kahn presided and
in opening the evening's programme
made a rather neat little speech, which
was in line with the spirit of the joyous i
occasion.
The main feature of the exercises was I
a debate between William Carey and Al- i
len Berry on one Bide and William Jen- I
Ben and John O'Rourke on the other. The i
question at issue was embodied in the fol- |
lowing resolution.. "That the United
States should establish a protectorate |
Over tho Philippine Islands."
William Carey and Allen Berry de- ,
fended the affirmative side of the ques
tion and William Jensen and John
O'Kourke argued it from a negative |
standpoint. it was evident that the
youthful debaters had studied the sub
ject carefully. They advanced logical
reasons, pro and con, which seemed to I
have been born of solid individual j
thought- In justice to the four young I
speakers it must be said that they pre- !
eented their arguments with the assur- 1
ing confidence of â  [-seasoned debaters.
Every one of the four speakers proved
himself to be an orator of exceptional i
ability and they spiced their arguments i
with oratorical gems of fervent patriot- '
ism without indulging in flights of lurid
fancy. The audience listened attentively i
and generously applauded each speaker. !
At the conclusion of the debate Chair- I
man Kahn requested the judgesâ Daniel i
Ryan; Hull McLaughry and H. V. Whit- j
Ingâ to! adjourn to one of 'he classrooms
to deliberate on their decision. When j
they returned to the hall Mr. Ryan, on
behalf of th.> judges, announced that they
had decided after due deliberation in fa
vor of the negative Bide. He then pre- i
sen ted the victors. Messrs. Jensen and j
<j'Rourke. with a handsome sllKen ban- !

Before It Is Cold.
During the session of Washington ;
Court, Order of Foresters, in the Alcazar I
building last night I. D. Levi. secretary j
of the court, toppled from his chair and |
fell senseless on the floor. Drs. Laidlaw I
and Gere were summoned and did what
they could for the sufferer, but he ex
pired in less than ten minutes. The f'or
c.ner's office was notified and at about
the same ttipm p some one sent word to
Tndertaker Metzler. The undertaker ar- i
rived a few minutes after Coroner's D^p- {
uties Lacombe and Flanagan and the re-]
suit was a disgusting wrangle over the ;
b..dy of tne dead.
Metzler has been on bad terms with
the Coroner for some time past and h;is
accused the latter of favoritism regard- ,
ing the disposition of dead bodies. A re- !
quest was made by members of th* lodge
that Levi's body be taken to an under
taker establishment instead of the j
Morgue. Deputy Lacombe replied that
he was willing provided any undertaker
be chosen but Metzler. Metzler was by
tliis time on the ground, and he. hacked
up by members of the lodge, insisted that
it .go' to his own establishment. Lacombe
at once threatened to remove the body

Wednesday. For Thursday, calling
day. it was necessary to impress Into
service the older girls, who very pret
tily showed how cleverly much yawn
ing may be concealed by handshakes
and perfunctory compliments. Then
some more little girls gave an exhibi
tion of Friday, sweeping day, and
some others, dressed after the fashion
and bespectacled like grandmothers,
and still others garbed as cooks, ex
plained the mysteries of cooking day
and the day of rest. *
The little boys of the academy got
their first and only chance of the aft
ernoon in the "Fiddlers' Escapade."
They made the most of it. To a lilt
ing air they romped on to the stage
in cone-shaped hats, masks covering
the upper part of their faces. It was
hard to tell from their youthful voiced
in just what the "Fiddler's Escapade"
consisted, but judging from the joy
they seemed to extract from the per
formance and the amount of wriggling
they injected into it. it must have been
extremely pleasant.
One of the prettiest numbers on (he
programme was the choral dance,
"The Wood Nymph's Invitation." by.
ten young girls of the. "junior class."
They danced on to a tripping measure,
their shoulders bearing wreaths of
green, each carrying a basket of
sweet pea blossoms. As they danced
they sang the invitation and waved
their blossoms In graceful curves that
sent the perfume over the .entire
house. Nothing could have been sim
pler or more beautiful, and by com
mon consent it was voted the most
charming number of the afternoon.
"Die Kapelle," a semi-chorus by the
members of the German class, and "I."
Voyageur Egare dans les Nieges dv St.
Bernard." by the French class, showed
the proficiency of the scholars in these
branches. The elocution classes also
showed marked proficiency, the first
class reciting the "Answered Prayer"
and the second class "The Heroes of
the Maine." The exclusively musical
numbers revealed an amazing amount
of talent in. the academy. The orchefl
selected and Metzler agreed to convey the
body to hi? rival's establishment. ' He
makes the claim that he can demand
heavy da ranges of Coroner Hill for de
priving him of a case on which he had
been summoned.
The Coroner's office defends itself by
Baying that the Coroner must remove a.
body fmm a public building, but he can
order it to any place he chooses until
after the inquest has been held. It then
passes from his jurisdiction and the fam
ily or friends of the deceased can select
any undertaker they choose to take care
of the remains.

due to apoplexy, hut an autopsy will be

A Carpenter's Good Name Saved by
a Mission School Teacher's
Shrewdness.
To Miss Louise A. Ren wick, a teacher
In the Horace Mann School on Mission
street, ii>'nrno C. Damon, a carpenter ac
cused of theft, owes his exoneration. A
week ago last Thursday. liamon was em
ployed to do wimp work on the house of
a peddler named Layonettl. After he had
completed the work Mrs. Layonettl of
fered him payment for his services, but
he refused t" accept money, saying: that
If i ho woman would "stand the treat" he
would he satisfied. Accordingly she took
from a purse, which was concealed under
a mattress in the room, some small
change and visited a corner grocery,
where she purchased liquid refreshments.
When she returned the purse containing'
$100 was gone and shortly afterward
Damon was arrested and charged with
the crime.
While the suspect was in jail, George
Thomas, a son of Mrs. Layoneitt. was
spending money lavishly on his compan
ions at the Horace Mann â¢School. His
teacher. Miss Renwick. noted that he
purchased luxuries with which hoys of his
means could not be provided and Inquiry
at his home disclose, i the fact thai his
parents had given him no money to spend.
Another lad named Peter Peterson also
apparently had suddenly acquired mys
terious wealth. While Mrs. Layonettl
questioned Peterson, Miss Renwick exam
ined Thomas and at length drew from him
a full confession that he had stolen his
mother's purse. <"aptain Glllen was noti
fied and immediately removed the sus
picion from Damon's shoulders.
BREEDING DISEASE.
An Unsavory Pool in the Rear of a
; -;Y;"%; Hospital.
Health' Officer Lawlor inspected the
Maclean Hospital on Douglass' street, be
tween Eighteenth and Nineteenth, where
the smallpox patients 'are located, yes
terday morning- and found in. the rear of
the hospital and on the same property a
huge reservior containing several thou
sand gallons of putrid water, which is
being used for irrigating purposes. His
attention was attracted to the reservoir
by the stench, and on investigation found
the carcasses of a number of animals -in
the pool. He immediately ordered the
reservior drained into the nearest sewer
for discharge into the bay and later a
force of men was put to work to cut a
trench for that purpose. Dr. Lawlor s;u<i
that if the nuisance had been maintained
much longer the whole â of Eureka . Val
ley would probably have become Infected.

THREATENS HER LIFE.
Mrs. Rose L. Young Swears Out a
Warrant for the Arrest of Her
Husband Thomas.
Mrs. Rose L. foung, 44"7 Point Loboa
avenue, swore to a complaint In Judge
Treadwell's court yesterday afternoon for
the arrest of her husband, Thomas
Young, on a charge of threats against
life.
The couple were married about three
years ago in San Luis Obispo, where Mrs.
Young owned a ranch. They soon quar
reled and Young, who was then getting
up a special edition for an evening paper
in this city. had to leave her. He re
turned to San Luis Obispo and Bent his
wife a note to meet him. She did so. and
he struck her with a rock, nearly killing
her. He was arrested and tried on the
charge of assault to murder and was sen
tenced to four years in San Quentin. He
was pardoned out after serving two
ypars. - â 
Since then she says he has been con
stantly dunning her for money, and be
cause she refuses to live with him he
has been sending her threatening letters
and also writing to her sister. Mrs. Mary
Ellen Kelly, calling her a monster.
"Since our marriage I have not received
a cent from my husband, but he has got
from me about $3000. I have forgiven him
more than once and taken him back, but
I am done with him now. He told me
that he was a reporter on The Call."
Young is not and never was a reporter
on The Call. ;
CYCLER RECOVERS DAMAGES.
Was Run Down by a Driver. Who
Must Pay for the Damaged
Wheel.
The California Associated Cycling Clubs
; have won another signal victory over a
reckless driver. Justice Groezingerren
' dered a decision yesterday in favor of a
wheelman who had been run down.
' Roy Pollock, an employe of Russ Bros.,
i while riding a wheel belonging to R. R.
Kuss. was run into and knocked down on
! Folsom and Twenty-second Btreets last
March by a wagon belonging to J. W.
Mcllugh and driven by Thomas O'Grady.
The hoy escaped uninjured, but the bicy
cle was wrecked. Mr. Russ appealed to
the California Associated Cycling Clubs,
of which he. is a member. The matter
was placed in the hands of Adams &. Ad
ams, attorneys for the association.
Justice Groezinger heard the testimony
yesterday and at once gave judgment to
' the wheelman. This is but one of many
suits won by thr association and in which
the rights of wheelmen have heen reaf
firmed each time.
BEATING THE ASSESSOR.
Citizens Who Value Their Posses
sions Too Cheaply.
Assessor Podge and his deputies arc fix
ing up trouble in plenty for certain tax
payers who are altogether too modest in
their estimates of their own possessions
when swearing to a tax statement. An
investigation has been going on for sev
eral weeks, with the result that some as
tonishing discrepancies have been found.
Assessor Dodge will not make public at
present the names of these shirkers, but
he says there are numerous instances
where people have sworn that their per
sonal property did not exceed $50 or $100,
while he or his deputies have discovered
personal property amounting to several
thousand dollars..
In one instance a man who is positively
known to own personal property valued
at between $50,000 and $75,000 sent in a
statement giving the total valuation of
his property at $100. In every instance of
this nature the property owner will be
compelled to pay tax on the full valua
tion of his- property. . .
Warming of an Engine House.
A delightful house-warming was given
by the ladies of the Sunset District at the
newly erected house of No. 2 chemical
engine last eveninig. A jolly good time
was had under the direction of the la
dies' committee: Mrs. Delia Moldrut.
Mrs. \V. H. Jones, Mrs. T. S. Brundage,
Mrs. W. W. Allen and Mrs. A. Harring
ton. Mrs. Moldrut, as chairman, deliv
ered an address of thanks to Chief Sulli
van ;ind the Board of Fire Wardens for
their efforts in securing the new house for
the company. This address was replied
to In behalf of Chief Sullivan by Captain
Kelly of the company. The following Is
the programme:
Opening remarks, Edward Ewald; overture.
Sunset Quartet (colored); son*. "Ragtime
Dance." Murray; song, "I Thought I Heard
Homebody Calling Me," Mrs. George Vomsack;
recitation. "Sunset Heights, or the Nob Hill of
the Town," Miss Lillian Rhodes; banjo solo,
Charles B. Era t her; piano solo. William Mc-
Devitt; vocal duet. Joe. Hansen and Fred Reck;
humorous short stories. Charles Elocher; char
acter sketches. Miss M. McCarty and Miss T.
Connelly.
Light Registration.
Registrar Steppacher thinks thp regis
tration of voters this year will fall far
short of what it was last fall, when it
was 10,000 less than the actual vote. Par
ty lenders are deeply interested In the ap
parent apathy of the voters and will
strive to awaken interest*] the approach
ing election.
Justin McCarthy has a character
study of Pope Leo XIII in next Sun

THE BOARD OF HEALTH.
* I "HE degradation of local politics, through the in
â  iiuencc of Dan local politics, through the is
[ Dan Burns and W. F. Hcrrin. is
* well illustrated by the temporary deadlock in the
Board of Health over the choice of a secretary.
Tested even by the low boss standard, but for the fact
of its existence the candidacy of Leon Deanery would
be inconceivable. How the Burns-Herrin lash, or
dinarily swung and cracked under the dictation of
the railroad monopoly, should be tolerated even for a
moment by the gentlemen who compose the Board of
Health, particularly when it is raised to drive Leon
Dennery into their camp, is beyond ordinary compre
â n.
These gentlemen, to whatever influences they may
owe their' selection, are nevertheless of fair profes
sional and social standing. It is hardly possible that
they or their personal or political friends can have
justly estimated the position they would occupy
toward the community if they yielded to the pressure
of Dnn Burns and Herrin and elected a man of no
toriously infamous character and habits to the office
r f their secretary. It is not too much, to say that
there is scarcely a respectable family in San Fran
ci>co by whom Leon Dennery would be recognized,
and that the mere fact that Dan Burns and Herrin
propose to pay an infamous price for cortupt legisla
tive services by forcing him into a responsible posi
tion iÂ« a chmning characterization of the railroad
candidate for a Federal Senatqrship. There are,
how( degrees even in viciousness, and Leon Den
m-ry would turn the stomach of every, municipal boss
v.c have had â except Dan Burns'.
The Call appeals to the members of the Board of
Health, collectively and individually, to spurn this in
tolerable assault upon their vii manhood. Dr. Barbat
is. the physician of Dan Burns and doubtless owes his
appointment to that fact. ' But the evidence i- that he
i- a great deal better than his patient. ' Dr. Payne was
the choice of Major McLaughlin, chairman of the Re
publican State Central Committee. Dr. Keeney is a
relative of William Alvord, president of the Bank of
California and of the Police Commission, a gentle
man who for many years has been identified with the
solid financial interests and with the best society oi
Sp.n Francisco. Dr. Coffey is the surgeon to the
Marl Street Railway Company, and, although the
particular choice of William F. Herrin, has been de
servedly esteemed [or his professional and social
merits. Is there any one of these gentlemen who
would voluntarily take Leon Dennery by the hand or
permit him even to stand where he could be seen by
members of his own family? This is a fair test. No
moral pariah, whose conduct has been so indescrib
able that it has necessarily escaped newspaper pub
licity, and whose mere presence in a respectable home
would be unendurable, should even have been men
tioned as a candidate for an official position, and.
when impudently obtruded, the door should have been
hanged in his face without hesitation and without de
lay. Scorn and contempt are the only words that
fairly express the manner in which this demand of
Dan Burns and W. F. Herrin, at any rate, should
have been received.
The attitude of the Board of Health at the best has
been bad enough. In the public mind it represents
the railroad despotism as administered in State ap
pointments by Dan Burns, Herrin and Governor
Gage. Its independence has been handicapped by
the sources from which it emanated. Its appoint
ments already made to a great degree have ignored the
tests which should be and under civil service rules
would be applied to State and municipal employes.
There is every indication that in changes yet to be
made, in institutions from which political influence
should be completely withdrawn, the public interests
will be officially disregarded.
All these evidences of political degeneracy are hu
miliating. But the selection of Leon Dennery, es
pecially after the preliminary strategy now so appar
ent, would be "the last straw that would break the
camel's back." The patience of the people is not ab
solutely unlimited.

MAYOR PHELAN BUNKOED.
ON' April 3, 1899, the Board of Supervisors fixed \
the gas rate to consumers at $i 10 per thou
sand feet. For this action no credit whatever
was due to the majority of the board. It was the
usual notice issued by a new ring that had not been
' recognized by the corporations with sufficient prompt
ness, and everybody understood what it meant. There
was, however, a respectable minority in the board.
1 and Mayor Phelan seemed inclined to avail himself of
;an opportunity to render a public service. The ring
was speedily anxious to repent of its simulated
I righteousness, and to prove the sincerity of its re-.
1 pentance by conceding to the gas monopoly all it
: claimed. But. in respect to this matter, as in the case
i of the attempted robbery by the Market Street Rail
way Company, the Mayor and the minority presented
j a front that appeared to be bold and compact.
Mayor Phelan claimed that, having once been es
; tablished, the gas rate for a year was beyond recon
! sideration. and. therefore, that the $i 10 figure would
stand. The San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany brought an action against Major W. B. Hooper
I cf the Occidental Hotel in order to test this question,
! which is now under consideration before Judge Sea
i well. That corporation and the Pacific Gas Improve
! rrent Company did not in other respects sleep upon
their assumed rights, but, ignoring the new rate,
' pressed their bills at the old figures before the regret
, ful and complacent majority of the board, determined
' to prove that when they did one thing honest upon
its face for their constituents they did not mean it.
At last, through a fortuitous concurrence of events,
when the Mayor was certainly prompt in seizing a
â favorable opportunity, the board adjourned sine die,
I Jind it was supposed that no legal meeting before the
! first Monday in July was possible without his affirma
tive sanction. That at least was his pronounced
i opinion of the law, alter consultation with his attor
ney. The Call doubted the soundness of this conclu
sion, but it was not the Mayor's legal adviser. On Mon
ilay last the majority of the board were determined to
hold a meeting. The Call suggested and the minority j
felt that their absence might prove injurious to the
! public business. Negotiations with the Mayor and
; the minority were rapidly pushed by the gas mon
: opoly, through its astute attorneys, and a compromise
effected, in which Mr. Phelan bore the con
; spicuous part, by which, after July I, the price of gas
I to consumers is to be placed at $i 50 instead of $1 75
i per thousand feet. 40 cents per thousand more than j
the rate prescribed on April .}. and. with the highest
margin for profit that would have even a semblance
of decency. 15 cents per thousand more than the com-
I modity is worth. There were other slight conces
sions', and. at Mr. Phelan's suggestion, in order to
1 clinch the matter beyond the possibility of retrac
tion, the settlement was reduced to writing and for
mally adopted by the board. Thus a protracted and
a successful fight was yielded by the temporary vic
tors, and a moderate sized briek â which is lead and
not cold â accepted by Mayor Phelan and the minor
ity of the Board of Supervisor:". It i- claimed by Mr.
Phelan and the Examiner that a saving to the com
munity of 5.u0.000 per annum has been secured, and
that the validity or the invali : *y of the $1 10 rate is
not influenced by the compro; ; >e. This proposition
appears to be of very questionable accuracy. In the
case before Judge Seawell the settlement has already
been offered in evidence and its admissibility strongly
argued. There is at least some prospect that it will j
nullify the order upon which Major Hooper depends, j
Put, whether it accomplishes this purpose or not, it
i^ a complete backdown from the uncompromising at
titude Mr. Phelan had assumed and which he was re
lied upon to maintain, and most likely it has already
cost in money a larger amount than the whole un
satisfactory reduction for a year would aggregate.
On April .?. 1890. when the $r 10 rate was fixed.
f;ns stock opened in the Stock Exchange at $76 per
. share. The following morning it dropped to $71 50,
! and it continued to fall until June 5. when it reached
its lowest point of $60 25. It has now advanced to
?75, or within Si of the price first stated. Let Mr.
I Phelan study the transactions in this. stock in which
many citizens in moderate circumstances have in
vested, and he may find that both himself and the
Examiner have crowed too soon. Relying on the
In ild and apparently consistent stand he took for the
public good, and believing that there would be no
>Ã¼b>tantial change in his position and that he held the
power in his own hands, investors in gas stock have
undoubtedly become alarmed and sold out at re
duced prices, and now they find the full value has been
restored and that their loss, which means speculative
gain, is irreparable, while Mr. Phelan and the Ex-
I aminer brag day by day of a settlement that was ac
tually dictated by the gas monopoly and played di
rectly into its hands.
It is unfortunate for a municipality when its chief
officer has his judgment perpetually clouded and his
determination constantly weakened by his aspirations
for re-election and for the gratification of his per
sonal ambition. This is the situation occupied by Mr.
Phelan. It reminds us of the Scandinavian ape. when
the Xorse pods, at their annual festival, used to send
Thor after a caldron in which to heat savory messes,
and he invariably returned with the pot on his head,
like a huge hat. an<] its ears reaching down to his
heels. Mr. Phelan has got back from his raid upon
the gas monopoly with his head entirely covered by
the stopper it placed upon him.
THE TARIFF AND THE TRUSTS.
HENRY O. HAVEMEYER, president of the
American Sugar Refining Company, has evi
dently become so panic stricken by the Bryan
ite attack on trusts that he is willing to say or do almost
anything to turn the attack in another direction. In
! his evidence given before the Industrial Commission
on Wednesday he sought to give a new turn to
j demagogue clamor by denouncing the protective
1 tariff and picturing that as a scheme by which the
people are plundered.
It goes without saying that Mr. Havemeyer's words
1 will be warmly and eagerly taken up by the dema
gogues of the press and. of the stump. The orators
and the editors who but a short time ago coupled his
name with that of Rockefeller as frightful examples
! of the plutocracy of trusts will now begin to laud him
| as a Daniel come to judgment, and every sentence of
! his testimony will be quoted with as much reverence
jas if it were a gospel text. Havemeyer will be an
i authority for the Bryanites, and. while they denounce
I every other millionaire in sight, they will except him,
! along with the owners of silver mines, because of his
; contribution to their campaign of discontent.
There is nothing new in the Havemeyer statements.
' The charge that trusts are an outgrowth of protection
'is an old one. Cleveland made it in his famous phrase
; about the "communism of pelf," and it was made by
i other free-traders before him. It was, in fact, one of
the arguments used against the protective tariff with
; most persistence and clamor in the campaign that re
i suited in the election of Cleveland for #is second
! term. The people then set aside the protective sys
! tern, and did thereby injure the trusts, but at the
! same time they injured every other American industry
j as well, and brought about a financial depression and
THE SA!N FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 16. 1899.
industrial paralysis from which we did not begin to
recover until protection was restored.
It is to be noted that while Havemeyer asserts that
protection is in the interests of trusts generally, he
was careful to repeat more than once that his company
derives no benefit from the tariff whatever. All other
trusts may be spoliators of the public through the
means afforded by protection, but not his, * It thus ap
pears from his own statement that the only trust of
whose business he is at all- competent to speak is one
that was not built up by the protective system, nor
is maintained by that system, nor is in any way de
pendent upon it. .
The argument that protection is of advantage to
trusts has in it this much of truth: Protection is de
signed to promote and to benefit all American indus
tries, and so far as trusts represent those industries they
are benefited. They are not, however, the creatures
of protection. They exist in Great Britain under free
trade as abundantly as in this country. There are, in
deed, good reasons for believing there would be a
greater number of industries dominated by trusts in
the United States under free trade than under pro
tection, because free trade would break down and de
stroy in all lines of industry many of the smaller es
tablishments now competing with the trusts.
The Havemeyer evidence, therefore, while making
a pretty good campaign document for v the Bryanites,
is not likely to help their cause to any great extent.
It deals with a subject long since threshed out, and
adds to it only a lot more chaff not worth rethreshing.
THE SUPPLY OF GOLD.
THE advocates of free silver and irredeemable
paper inflation have seized eagerly upon the
dicta of Mr. Roberts, Director oi the Mint, in
connection with the increasing supply of gold.
In the February Forum Mr. Roberts showed that i
the output of gold, which in 1890 was $118,848,700, in
1898 was $285,000,000. He ascribes advance in prices
tj this increase in the volume of the metal as poten
tial money. His statement is: "Much has been written
in recent years by gold standard advocates against the
quantitative theory of money. In so far as their ar- J
guments have gone to show that the quantity of I
money in circulation is but one element in prices, and
is usually so obscured by other influences that it can
be scarcely traced, they are good, but I do not see
how it can be questioned that the quantity of gold
available in the world affects its exchangerelations to
other commodities."
The Chronicle highly approves this and girds at j
the gold standard men, using the quantitative theory !
of money as a weapon. It points to the rise in prices i
as proof that the bimetallism free silver theory was j
right. The quantitative theory has some warrant in j
the conclusions of John Locke, but its modern ad
vecates have chosen to leave out of the problem the
exchange value of other products to each other, ex
cluding money which is merely the medium that
effects the exchange.
In iB6O wheat was $1 54 a bushel and cotton was
ioI-J cents a pound, while the money in this country
was $13 85 per capita. Our money now is about $27
per capita. The quantity has doubled, but the same
issue of the Chronicle quotes in its market report
wheat at 75 cents and cotton at 3 cents. If the quan
titative theory of money be good, wheat and cotton
should be double the price of iB6O. From 1827 to
1847 wheat ranged above $1 per bushel, and in the
latter year it was $1 42. It did not reach the latter
price, nor pass it. again until 1854, when it rose to
$4 25, and the next year to $2 46. but fell in 1856
to $r 83. This was after the discovery of gold in
California and Australia, and their great additions to
the volume of that metal. But in 1836 wheat was
$1 80, and in 1837 $r 85, and it did not reach those
prices again after 1855. The reason for the rise and
fall in prices must be sought elsewhere than in the
quantitative theory of money. If it held good not
wheat alone but all prices would rise and fall evenly
with the fluctuation in the volume of money, but they
do not.
A far more darling theory held by the double stan
dard advocates and by the Chronicle when it was
abroad in the land supporting 16 to i was that there
was an indissoluble relation between the price of wheat
and that of silver. Rut in 1840 wheat was $^ 09 when
silver was $1 .V. and in 1892 wheat was $1 03 when
silver was 87 cents.
If prices fluctuated evenly with the quantity of ;
money or the value of silver, the inflationists would j
prove their argument by simply stating it, but they â 
dc not
There are other factors in the problem. High
wheat is usually associated with low wool and cotton.
This fact has its root in the simple, primitive needs of
man. Food is his first necessity, clothing is second
ary. When wheat is high he fills his belly at the ex
pense of his back. The demand for clothing fabrics
declines because earnings are absorbed in getting
food. When food is cheap money can be spared for
clothing. A cross current, again, affects these con
ditions. As science is applied to production, and
economies in it appear as the result of human intelli
gence, it increases, and the supply and demand get
nearer neck and neck.
The cotton pin effected economy in that fiber. A
machine to husk corn would cheapen the production
of that cereal.
The qualitative philosophers never cease to attack
the gold standard men for conclusions which they
claim are not based cm sufficient data, but at the same
time they cancel all data that may affect their own
pet theory and ascribe to it a wide range of material,
moral and economic results, to which it has no more
relation than a polar bear sucking his paws under the
Arctic Circle has to the price of milk in Marin
County.
Colonel William J. Bryan of Nebraska did not do
any fighting in the war, but he is getting in his work
now. In a recent speech he declared that the man
who antagonizes trusts is quite as brave as the man
who swims a river or climbs a hill. He must have
had Bryan, Funston and Roosevelt in mind when he
said that.
It is said that the Standard Oil Company is to be
reorganized to conform to the demands of public sen
timent. The officers of the great trust are probably
aware that reorganization on such lines would mean
self-destruction to them.

HERR STARK SCORES
A PARTIAL VICTORY
HERR FERDINAND STARK, has won a victory over his tailors,
Messrs. Bernard & Leperâ not an absolute' victory, but just a nice, com
fortable victory that absolves him from loosening UP flfty-flve large,
ripe dollars for a misfit dress suit and at the same time sticks him for
$2 50 for putting in a new foundation in the basement of a pair of trousers and
about $9 costs of court.
Justice of the Peace Barry rendered his decision yesterday afternoon m
the suit brought by Bernard & Leger against the professor to recover 500.
the price of a dress suit, and $2 50 for repairs. The case came up for trial
on Wednesday, at which time Professor Stark demonstrated, evidently to
the entire satisfaction of the court, that the clothes he was asked to pay for
did not envelop his figure with that nicety that a decollete waistcoat and
swallow-tail coat should, despite the expert testimony to the contrary, toi
yesterday his Honor decided that Herr Stark need not pay for the suit but
that the other charge of $2 50 was just and proper and would have to be paid.
This decision carries costs, so the professor will find his- debut in court not
an unqualified success.

ASHTON STEVENS Chjats
flbout a Female Imperson
ator and a Clever but Ap
propriating Monologist.
THE female impersonator is not
the noblest work of God. Ha is
a disease at best, and on the
surface of me his epicene antics
induce gooseflesh. This may be a
prejudice of mine, but it is pretty gen
eral among healthy men. There was a
time when the stage had to get along
with, these sexless mysteries, but that
time has passed. What was good
enough for William Shakespeare in the
days when women had not found their
stage legs is not good enough for us.
Women almost dominate the stage to
day, and we do not regret it.
All this apropos of Tacianu, the male
lady who is warbling at the Orpheum.
Tacianu is not only a ripe soprano, but
a bouncing barytone as well. He sings
duets with himself, and, to be fair, does
the feat very neatly. But he wears
skirts and silk stockings, and wobbles
his pectoral embonpoint at the audi
ence, and gives me the creeps. I can't
praise him â nor much of the rest of
the bill for that matter.
I pride myself on being one of the
most confirmed Orpheum-goers in the
town. The week doesn't pass that does
not count me among those present.
From the Orpheum I have learned to
Khow what good vaudeville really is.
But I haven't found much of it there
these last two weeks. Henri French,
the bicycle fiend, is a first-rate portion;
and so is Houdini, the handcuff thwart -
er and gambler's envy; but the others
are not front rank. And the Orpheum has
spoiled us into expecting little short of
the foremost. The Orpheum is. as I
have often said in this paper, the best
variety house, week in and week out,
in the country. But this is a week
out.
The only one of the four new turns
that is at all Orpheum-like is con
tributed by Fred Nlblo, a monologist.
Mr. Niblo wears a smart frock coat and
human trousers; his manner is gentle
and altogether he is something quite
different. But this difference is purely
personal. His specialty consists In tell
ing other fellows' paps and stories. But
he thieves quite amiably. Only I wish
he wouldn't sing. Some men with a
no-vnioe are very funny. Mr. Niblo is
merely foolish. Â«Btlll, as he says:
Sometimes I think I'm silly,
Somftimps T think 1 m funny;
But 1 wouldn't be so silly
If I didn't need the money.

SAILING VESSELS MUST
UNDERGO INSPECTION
NO MORE ROTTEN COFFINS TO
GO TO SEA.
Masters and Mates Mt*st Stand an
Examination as to Their Com
petency to Handle Ships.
Only two weeks more remain for the in
spection of sailing vessels of more than
700 tons gross, and all other vessels and
barges of more than 100 tons gross carry
ing pasengers for hire. On and after July
1 of this year all vessels of the classes
mentioned must have been examined by
the local Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers,
otherwise they will not be allowed to sail.
The masters and chief mates of such ves
sels must be duly licensed as such' by ihe
inspectors.
Although Inspectors Bolles and Bulge- j
have been ready at all times since Ma;' 1 j
to inspect sailing vessels, their services i
were not sought until last Wednesday, ;
when they inspected and pave certificates :
to the masters of two small schooners.
Certified copies of certificates of inspec
tion for steam and sailing vessels and
bargee are issued by deputy collectors ot
Customs and must be kept exposed under â 
glass on board the vessel where they can 1
be seen by passengers and all others con- {
cerned. Failure to have such certificate â 
â will subject the owner of the vessel to a I
penalty of $500.
The new law also requires that masters j
and chief mates of such vessels shall be
examined and licensed by the local in- |
ppectors of steam vessels to entitle them i
to act in the capacity named, and it is ;
niadt unlawful to employ any unlicensed j
person, or for any unlicensed person to j
serve as master or chief mate of said ves
sels under a penalty of $100 for each of- j
fense. Masters and thief mates who have
actually served as such on sailing vessels
of more than 700 tons gross for the full ,
period of one year preceding the appllca- \
tion may be duly licensed upon satisfac- j
tory documentary evidence to that effect, j
provided such officers shall be found upon j
examination to be free from color blind- ;
ness. Applicants who have had no pie- j
vious service as master or mate except
upon inland waters must be duly exam
ined in navigation the same as required ;
for masters and mates of steam vessels, j

the applicants must be free from color |
blindness.
No person shall be examined as mast'?'- ;
who has not served a full year as chief j
mate of said vessels, and no person shall

unless he can present satisfactory docu- j
mentary evidence that he has had at leas' I
three full years' experience on sailing ves
sels of 300 gross tons and upward.

i far more able to carry on an organized

I whom we promised self-government. As
! Insurrectionists now, they must later be-
I come citizens, unless we stop in our fool
! hardy course, entering into a competition
; with our laborers, which is more to he
: dreaded by them than that of the Chl
j nese. As citizens of a common country,
! those who are now the loudest expan
! plonists are probably the very ones who
] can best use the cheap labor there, and
! under the constitution soil the products
of that lahor herein direct competition
j with the products of our labor.
The anti-expansionists believe no good

I blood spilled, the burden of taxation in

HELPED BY THE CHARITIES
. VICTOR JOUMILEN, A WAITER,
WANTED BY THE POLICE.
â Â« â
He Is Out on His Own Recognizance
and His Wife Is Mortally
Afraid That He Will Kill
Her.
The police are searching for Victor
Joumilen, a waiter, as his wife, who lives
at lf*l3*i Stockton street with her four
young children. Is afraid that he will
force Ills way Into the house at any mo
ment and kill her, as he. has on more than
one occasion threatened to do.
Joumilen appeared before Judge Tread
well on Monday to answer a charge of
failure to provide. The wife was present
with her children, but for some unex
plained reason the case was not heard and
It was continued until Wednesday, Jou
milen being released on his own recogni
zance. As soon as his wife heard the
order of court she made a scene, declaring
that her husband would kill her. The
Judge rebuked her for making a scene and
got Joumelin to promise that he would not
go near the house till the case was dis
posed of.
Mrs. Joumelin insisted on getting a war
rant for the arrest'of her husband on the
charge of threats against life, but whs
unable to obtain it. She expressed berÃelf
as being mortally afraid of her life, and a
neighbor who was. present with her in
court promised to remain in the house
with her.
When the case was called on "Wednesday
Joumelin failed to appear and a bench
warrant was Issued tor his arrest. The
case whs again called yesterday, but the
police said they were unable to find Jou
melin, and at their request a continuance
was granted fur a week in the hope that
they would be able to arrest him mean
time.
"My husband." said Mrs. Joumelin yes
terday, "makes good wages, but he spends
all his money in playing poker at the
Cafe Lafayette and Cafe Royal and leaves
his children to starve. I have been com
pelled to ask assistance from the Asso
ciated Charities, and if it had not been for
tln-m we certainly would have starved.
1 have pleaded with my husband to give
up his passion for gambling, but it has
been of no use. After losing his m'-ney
at poker-playing he would come hnme un
der the influence of liquor and abuse me
because 1 did not have food and drnsk for
him Two or three times recently he has
threatened to kill me. nr.d one day last
wek he oh.ised me out of the house with
a carving knife in his hand. I tried to
gel <-â  policeman but could not find ono.
I am afraid now that 1 have had him
arrested be will kill me unless he is sent
to iall." .

HESSIAN FLY IN
THE MONTEREY
GRAIN FIELDS
Dr. H. H. Behr Exam
ines the Midge.
NO CAUSE FOP SERIOUS ALARM
- â¦ - â
THE PEST CAN BE READILY DE
STROYED.
â â¦ â /
It Has Appeared Eefore iv California
and Failed to Thrive â Outline
of Its Peculiar Character
and History.
The farmers of Monterey County and
some of their alarmist friends are mak
ing much ado about little over the ap
pearance in the grain of a poisonous
Insect known as the Hessian fly. It
has been demonstrated beyond ques
tion that the destructive midge found
on the farms near Salinas is the Hes
sian fly. Specimens of the insect were
sent to Dr. H. H. Behr, one of the
most accomplished entomologists on
the coast, and yesterday he submitted
the results of his examination. He
finds that the insect is the Hessian fly,
but that fact calls for no expression of
great alarm.
It was reported that the insect had
never before made its appearance in
this State, and if it really had come it
had been imported from Australia or
Europe. The alarmists declared that
the midge worked with devastating
energy in the grain and multiplied with
terrible rapidity. All sorts of disasters
were predicted to the crops of the
State and the results of Dr. Behr's ex
amination were awaited with anxiety.
The farmers of Monterey ma?, now
breath more freely. While the speci
mens of the insect furnishe 1 to Dr.
Behr were not sufficient to enable him
to determine to just what species of the
Hessian fly the specimens belong, the
entomologist satisfied himself that they
are really Hessian flies.
Dr. Behr says that while the insects
are by no means beneficial they are not
devastating and are easily destroyed.
They are natives of this State and were
not imported either from Europe or
Australia. Dr. Behr suspects that the
Hessian fly received its popular name
from the fart that it was never found
in Hessia. It has flourished in Hun
gary and as already indicated, is one
of the undesirable natives of this State.
Its first appearance, as far as known,
was in 1878. when it was easily and
quickly eradicated. Two or three times
after it appeared, but made no great
damage and after simple remedies were
applied disappeared. It was seen as
late as WT. hut created go great alarm.
Dr. Behr suggests that the best way.
or one of the moat effective methods to
destroy it is to burn the stubble of the
grain in which it has appeared. Un
less it appears in tremendous numbers
it is ii' t completely destructive. It par- j
tially destroys the quality of the grain, ;
but it does not spread rapidly and does
not thrive well in the climate of Cali
fornia. The insect lives also on wild
grasses and is nothing more or less
than a tiny midge of the same clasa
as the mosquito. It generally appears
in two species, but Dr. Behr did not
determine which of these was presented
to him. He does not intend to make
any further examination as one would
be unnecessary.
The farmers of Monterey may silence
their fears therefore of a plague and
the farmers <>f the State need take no
unnecessary alarm. While the Hessian
fly Is not a pleasant or a desirable visit
or it lives only a few weeks. It is
about one-seventh of an Inch in length
and is not unlike a small gnat. It is
a matter of some difficulty to tell when
the pest has been exterminated, but
where its appearance is no more serious
than it is at Monterey the remedy sug
gested and subsequent care will drive
out the insect.

DRIED FRUITS IX NEW YORK.
Mail advices from New York say:
"The general situation in prunes remains
practically as last reported, and buyers are
cautions about placing any considerable orders. 1
According to the statement of a man recently j
returned from the coast, the outlock for the 1
prune crop I? ivorable. He seems to think '
that the yield aver a larger part of California
will be fully as large as for the past tew
years. The general conditions are unchanged
and trade is weak in all positions because of i
the competition of fresh fruits.
â¢â No opening prices were received yesterday on
fl;iri'*utf i , BO tar as an be learned. Speculative |
prices of .â -f. mentioned heretofore, have
not been confirmed on the coast. Spot trading
is very quiet and confined only to small orders
for immediate consumption.
"The outlrok for dried peaches in California j

they are expected to be higher than last season.

EASTERN MARKETS.
Ni-.v 7ORK BTOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June 15.â The public continued
to hold aloof from the stock market, and deal
ings to-day were\almost wholly professional.
There was the semWance of strength at lone
time, due to sympathy with tit activity In a
small grr.up of specialties, whl'h were bought
by large Interests more or less. Identified with
them Prices of the group wi-rt advanced and
the traders bought the genen . list, causing
Fmall advances all around. But the rise failed
absolutely to invite any outside buying, and
the supporting tactics were abandoned during
the day. The listless condition that ensued
was such as to invite bear aggression. But
the bear party apparently suffered from the
seasonable, lassitude as much OS trie general
j.'iblic, and their operations were not pursued
with any vigor or determination. However,
the gains at one time established were prac
tically all wiped out before the close and net
losses are the rule, but the rest of them be
ing re^trlcttd to .ractiona. Sugar ruled above
yesterday's level, rising at one time nearly
four points, but closing with a net gain of
only 13,.I 3 ,. The Federal Steel stocks, Brooklyn
Transit, People's Gas, Kannattan and Con
rolidated Gas also enjoyed th<;ir period of
strength. There was an early break in the
Denver and Rio Grande stocks and Colorado
Fuel weakened late in thr cay on account of
the labor troubles over th.- new eight-hour
law in Colorado. American Smelting stiffened
two points on a few isolated transactions, the
officials of the company professing to feel no
Uneasiness over the strike, and alleging that It
came at a good time. American car showed
losses â â : three and two points respectively for
the common and preferred stocks, and P. C. C.
and St. Louis moved In an erratic manner
three points over yesterday's level. The belief
that the outward gold movements have not
yet concluded laud to the disinclination to buy
Btocks. â¢
The preliminary trade statement of the Treas
ury Department ;or May discloses that the total
exports for the fii-cal year for the first time
th Â«c of last year at the end of
May t.. Ok .-xt.-n: â¢: m mething over $5,000,000.
But the exports in June of last year ehoweil
r.'ase from the May exports and
the June expwrts for this year, which are
running much nearer to last year's level niuy
1 â¢ â¢.. exports foi tne fiscal year up
npi â¢ tented figures. The oon

â¢ year, will cause a marked diminu
tion in the country's favorable trade balance
fi 1 the fiscal year. Hut It is evident that the
win be between twenty and thirty
millions "\er half a billion dollars, which Is
far above the record of any previous year
Wall street Is still puzzled to
whether this enormous credit balance

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June IS.â first half hour of 1
the session In the wheat pit was marked by I
a good deal of apathy on the part of traders, â 
notwithstanding the almost sensational char-'
acter of the news affecting the Russian crop. '
The opening in September ranged from 76 7
to 77V\ compared with yesterday's closing .
price of 76Nic. There was no great buying de- '
mand at first, and for nearly half an hour I
the price hung around those figures. Then !
the market began to broaden, and once start- !
ed, the buying increased until the demand was :
the heaviest seen in the pit for Severn] days :
News regarding the condition of the Russian
crop, for some time more or less of a factor
dominated everything else In influence. Beer
bohm's statement that the wheat crop was" an
entire failure in a large area north of the
Black Sea was confirmed from many different !
sources during the day, private cablegrams
being in some cases even more gloomy in char- '
acter. The first bulge carried September to
.77Â»ic. This -was the call price, and sellin
against those privileges caused a slight reac
tion, but before noon offerings from thW source
were swamped by. the rush of buying orders
and the price continued to advance until Ben
tember had reached 7SK.c. This was l%c SiSove ;
yesterday's final figures. September fluctuated
between 78% c and 7S4c during the last half â¢
â¢hour's trading and was bringing 784 cat the
(lose. â¢ .
There was a firm, active market in corn.
Trading was Influenced partly by- the strength â 
of wheat. September closed V?'a%c higher.
Oats were In active demand and a good ad- '
vance was scored. The cash trade' was large. I
September closed %O%c higher.

OREEX FRUIT IXTERESTS.
NEW YORK, June 15.â Journal of Com
merce says: Further advices have been re- '
ceived concerning the combination of fruit
packing Interests. While the trade here would
not be surprised to learn at any tlmÂ« that j
California canned fruit packers had agreed to !
place their interests in the hands of a trust, i
it seems now to be felt that the persistent re- ;
ports that a combine had been formed were ]
premature, being based on the confidence felt ;
by those who Befit them in the ultimate sue- j
cess of the movement. It is reported that :
most of the packers have sold freely for future
delivery, and have placed all they dare to until
they know Just what green fruit will cost them.
Hence the. orders to their representatives In the
East to withdraw offerings which, in some
quarters, have been attributed to the fact that
packers had determined to leave the making of
future quotations to the combine. .
Apnrt from the formation of a trust as a
reason for higher prices, it Is stated on good
authority other and ample causes exist. These
are round in the increased cost of materials. I
aside from the fruit For instance, it is stated
solder costs 17 cents per pound, as against 8
cents at this time last year: tins cost 7.2 cents
more, the cost of labels' Is 40 cents higher, and
caÃes cost 1 cent more than a year ago. The
price for green fruit, notwithstanding crop* of j
most descriptions promise well, has been en- I
hanced by agitation among farmers for higher j
prices, supplemented by an increased demand I
this year for fruit to be hipped green.

Boston's Cemeery Card Catalogue.
All the data necessary for a complete
directory of tho old cemeteries in Boston
has been collected by the Cemetery Com
mission. The burying grounds have been
surveyed, the tombstone inscriptions cop
ied and the plans of the grounds have i
been worked out, showing where the
stones are located. All this information
will- be compiled into a catalogue system
like that at the Boston Public Library.
The name of the interred person is writ
ten on one side of the card and a copy
of the tomb inscription i 3 written on the
othfr side. This is the culmination of a
plan that was adopted by the Cemetery
Commission Boon after its appointment
the object of it hemp to establish a trust
worthy record, as complete in detail as it
is now possible to make it.â Boston Tnn

"TRIM YOUR SAILS
TO ONE DOLLAR"
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
MS Broaflway, June 15.
AUDITOR TRICED has Issued his ultimatum regarding the expense of
running the city for the next fiscal year. "The cost of maintenance
shall not exceed the amount raised by a $1 tax levy," said. Mr. Breed
this afternoon. "Jn this sum must also be included the $11,000 of deficit
fir Statutory salaries that must be paid nut of next year's funds, because
there ( * no money left from this year's Income."
There will be a total deficit of 138,000, $11,000 of which is for statutory
salaries, and $28,000, the amount in excess of the estimates upon which the
last tax levy waa made. By a technicality part of of this deficit can be paid
this year. The bond interest is due July 2, and naturally should be paid.
from this year's funds. The new fiscal year begins on July 1, and by spend
!:;lt the bond Interest for paying salaries, the situation is a little bit re
lieved, but It only adds to the burdens to be carried next year.
Auditor Breed expects the total tax levy will be $1.17. This is the statu
tory dollar for maintenance and the balance for bond Interest and redemp-
Should there be any de=ire to add to the park and boulevard fund this
levy must be Increased. All the estimates of the heads of departments
now being filed with the Auditor are being cut by him to conform to his
idea of maintaining the city on a dollar levy.

MISSING, AND
WARRANTS OUT
FOR HIS ARREST
John Moriarty Was a
Sport.
GAMBLING HIS DOWNFALL
WAS A TRUSTED EMPLOYE AT
KELLER'S.
Being at the Head of a Department
He Was Able to Pocket Small
Amounts With Im-
punity.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ (roadway, June 15.
Jnhti Moriarty, for many years a
trusted head of a department with the
M. .). Keller Company, is missing. This
afternoon eight warrant? accusing him of
misdemeanor embezzlement were sworn
to by Mr. Keller, and at once search be
gan tor Moriarty. ilis downfall is at
tributed to the race track.
For a long time Moriarty has been in
! a position of trust, one section of the
large store i.einK completely under his
.jurisdiction. It is alleged that he has for
some time past taken advantage of the
confidence of his employers to steal sums
of money paid Into the firm and for which
!i> Bhould have accounted. These sums
range from $2 50 to $50, and only after a
thorough examination of the accounts can
II be learned how much Mr. Moriarty's
accounts are short.
Moriarty has always enjoyed the repu
tation of being strictly honorable, and he
h,-is during the past right years been
lily promoted In the company on ac
â  count of his diligence :u\d ability.
Moriarty could not be found by the
detectives this afternoon, and it is be
lieved that he knows his defalcations
have been discovered. He was discharged
from the firm three weeks ago and since
then the alleged thefts have oeen discov
â  red
The system pursued by Morinrty was a
very petty one and consisted in pocketing
the deposits made of lady customers In
i the tailoring department. It became
, necessary, in order to cover up the theft
to add the amount taken to the bill. In
this way it is said that $2500 has been
taken.
Moriarty's friends say that the sums
taken were squandered playing the horses

MR. MILLER
IS SURPRISED
AT THE MAYOR
Anxious Seat Not to
His Liking.
ON THE POLITICAL GRILL
WHOM WOULD MILLER LIKE
FOR A SUCCESSOR?
Had He Been Elected City Engineer
He Would Have Been Able
to Vote on That
Subject.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 15.
M. K. Miller admits being taken by
surprise. Mr. Miller is the Superintendent
of Streets. In view of the fact that dur
ing the past year many Important com
mercial bodies of this city have com
mend, d Mr. Miller's work and that only
yesterday many influential residents of
Mr. Miller's ward asked that he be reap
pointed, It must he conceded that Mr.
Miller Is both a popular and an efficient
Street Superintendent. The streets have
no need to cry out to proclaim this. It is
known and admitted.
Mr. Miner's surprise consists in the fact
that the Mayor should not hurry to the
City Hall In a carriage and four and im
mediately offer a resolution reappointing
Mr. Miller for two years. Many people
would be equally surprised should the
Mayor do this. Yesterday and a week ago
from yesterday Mr. Snow quietly re
marked that Mr. Miller Is Superintendent
of Streets, is enjoying the salary derived
from that position and that as there Is no
talk of naming a successor and as Mr.
Miller will hold office until his successor
be appointed, there is no use in trying to
stir up a little political muss by taking
any official notice of the said Superintend
ent of Streets, M. K. Miller.
Mr. is reported as saying that
he had a little conversation with the
Mayor a few weeks ago and the Mayor
i did not indicate what he would do. In
i this instance, anyway, no gold brick was
handed out at the Mayor's office. Now
Mr. Miller saya he is snrprfsed that the
Mayor does not hasten to vote lor his re
appolntmi nt.
ii i here were no such thing as politics
in tlm city government Mr. .Miller would
not feel disconcerted in the least, hut
would be supremely happy and contented,
relying upon the city charter, which con
tains that variously Interpreted "no re
! moval except for cause" paragraph.
A few weeks ago Health Othcer Dunn
was removed from office on the vote of a
member of the Health Hoard, who openly
declared that "Dr. Dunn was the best
health officer the city of Oakland ever
had." This expression was a hoodoo in
Dr. Dunn'H case, the only inference left
being that had he not. been' so efficient ho
i might have retained his ofÃoe. In the
' petition to the Hoard of Works yesterday
1: is stated that Mr. Miller "is the best
Street Superintendent the city ever had."
[and now politicians are wondering
whether this recommendation -will prove
as much of a hoodoo as it did to Dr.
1 num.
The Mayor's friends, who stem to size
up his Honor's iflind very correctly, have
another view of it. They declare that Mr.
Snow will not be jammed by Mr. Dow or
by Mr. Miller. The Mayor, it is said, even
heard of the whispers of what would have
taken place bad Mr. Miller been elected
City Engineer, in which event, it is said,
I his' Honor would have had a very remote
seal in the rear on the Hoard of Works.
Again, say Mr. Snow's friends. Mr. Miller
â  Is in a very illogical position from a poli
tical standpoint He evidently does not
consider himself indispensable to the
Street Department, for he made two
heroic effi rts to get out of it and be City
Engineer Had Mr. Miller's ambition been
: gratified it would have been his sworn
â  duty under the charter to have voted for
some successor, if Mr. Snow should
think as Mr. Miller would have thought
i had he been elected City Engineer, it
would not be at all surprising. This Is the
Snow view.
It Is hardly likely that the Mayor will
' take any Bteps toward the removal of Mr.
Miller and if he be let alnne- It is more
; than probable that In the course of a few
weeks when he can do so without loss
Of political dignity, he will call up Mr.
Dow*B resolution and vote for it.
HEROIC WOMAN RESCUES
ANOTHER FROM DROWNING
OAKLAND, June 15.â But for the he
roic efforts of Mrs. M. F. Hudson, re
siding at 1418 Lake. Shore avenue, Mrs.
Balinda Ford, living at Tenth avenue and
East Nineteenth street, would have per
ished beneath the murky waters of Lake
Merritt this morning.
Sixty-six years of usefulness have loft |
Mrs. Ford Inlirm, and recent Illness has ;
caused temporary mental derangement.
When she left home this morning- she In
formed her daughters that she intended
visit iiiK friends downtown. She was next
seen by Mrs. Hudson wading out into
Lake Merritt.
There w;is no one close at hand for Mrs.
Hudson to summon, so she proved herself
equal to the occasion by rushing into the
water and wading in to rescue the aged
woman, who had by this time sunk to
her waist. At the peril of her life and i
lifter the greatest exertion the heroic res- I
iuir succeeded in dragging- Mrs. Ford to j
the shore. She was afterward taken to I
the Hudson residence, where dry and
warm clothing were supplied, so that she
could be removed to the Receiving Hos
pital.
It was supposed that Mrs. Ford at
tempted t'i commit suicide, but her
daughters refute this theory and say that
she probably wandered to the lake un
mindfully and that she becomes quite
childish at times and bewildered.

PARENTS BRING SUIT
AGAINST THEIR SON
LEO HERINGHI'S PLACE AT
TACHED.
The Action Said to BÂ« the Result of
the Pawnbroker's TTnfilial Con
duct Toward the Old Folks.
Suit was filed In the Justices' court yes
terday against Leo Heringhl, the pawn
broker of 10*4 Stockton street, by his pa
rents, Bernardo Heringhl and Minnie
HÂ«ringhl. The cause of action is for
breach of contract, and the complaint
states "that in and by a certain contract
In writing, dated the 7th oay of March,
1895, said defendant promised to pay to
plaintiffs the sum of $75 on the first day
of May, 1899, and $75 on the first day of
June, 1899, and that neither of said sums
or any part thereof has been paid."
A writ of attachment was also issued
against the premises on Stockton street
and the place is now in the hands of the
Sheriff.
According to the other members of the
family, the suit Is the outcome of rn
filial conduct toward the old folks on the
part of their son. Leo. Samuel Heringhi,
another son, in discussing tne subject last
night, said:
"Leo's actions during the last few
months have nearly broken our mother's
heart. She is 71 years of age, and I fear
that her present troubles will but hasten
her end. In September, 1592, she mort
gaged her home at 2222 Jackson street for
$5000 in order to set L.co up in business.
In return for the loan of the money she
was to receive $75 a month out of the busi
ness for the term of her natural life, tie
has refused to pay the agreed amounts
and the suit is the" result.
"A year ago, when she was seriously ill.
she sent for him, but he would not go to
see her.
"Leo's business transactions have been
questionable, to say the least. Two
months ago. in order to buy out his
brother Aaron, he took pledged goods out
of his store on Stockton street and re
pledged them with the Baldwin Jewelry
Company for $10,800. When he was on
Sixth street he pawned watches which
had been left to be repaired, with the
pawnbroker. J. L. Franklin.
"He has made $10,(>o0 out of the money
advanced to him by his mother. We re
gret to be obliged to tell it. but these are
the facts and can be verified."

"In Oakland and Sacramento, whore the

"Throughout the East the growth of

Little Egypt Must Pay.
A writ of habeas corpus sworn out on
behalf of Little Egypt was dismissed by
judge Cook yesterday, and in consequence
the dancer must pay the line Opposed
upon her for giving an indecent exhibi

defendant's counsel that the pleadings In
the case were faulty, as they did not set
forth that the dance was given in public,
but the court held that it was a matter
of proof and not a matter of pleading,
and hence the accused was remanded.
She will now pay her fine.

The rival middle-weight boxers matched
by the National Athletic Cluh will nu- t
in the arena ut Woodward's Pavilion to
night to settlÂ« their differences, under the
direction of Hiram B. Cook as referee.
Joe Reay and "Dummy" Rowan will be
the lirst brace of boxors to enter the ring,
being scheduled to a>< fifteen rounds. In
the betting that has been 'I >!>â¢â  Rowan
lias been Installed favorite at Ddds of 10
to s, lmt no great amount of money has
, gone into the poolbox up to the present
lime. Reay hap trained at the Olympic
Club with De Witt Van Court as mentor.
The latest Ideas In blows and style nave
been practiced, and the Olympian is pro
nounced a much more finished boxer than
i he has heretofore shown himself.
The friends of Rowan express the ut- !
most confidence in his ability both as a
boxer and as a man able to stand pun
ishment, but hÂ» is handicapped in the
ring In being both deaf and dumb. His
! brother will be in his corner to Interpret
Tim McGrath'a instructions. McGratb is
afraid his finders will refuse to talk in
the excitement of the fight, so the brother
will stand by ready to act as Interpreter.
The principal bout will be between Goff
and Franey. Both men have defeated a
lot of fairly good boxers. Goff has to his :
credit a draw with George Byers; defeat-

May Be a, Mystery.
I. ate last night a young woman, well
dressed and giving tho name of Kmma
Johnson, was picked up at the corner of
Seventh and Howard streets and tak^n
to the Receiving Hospital. The woman
says she fell in the street from exhaus
tion, having eaten nothing all day. She
refuses to give any information further
than a statement that she has unsuccess
fully sought work as a domestic and has
not !,.-.ii in the city long.
The expensive clothing worn by (he
woman and her desire to reveal nothing
lead the police to believe that a mystery
underlies her suddenly helpless condition.

ISTHMIAN CANAL
COMMISSIONERS
Meet and Make Walker
President.
CALL AT THE WHITF HOUSE
MUCH PRELIMINARY WORK YET
TO BE DONE.
Careful Examination of Previous Re
ports to Be Had Before a Start
Is Made for Scene of
Operations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 15.â The mem
bers of the commission appointed by
the President to examine Into the
question of the most feasible route f' r
a canal across the isthmus of Nicara
gua met this morning in the Corcoran
building. The only absentee was ex-
Senator Pasco of Florida. Admiral
Walker was elected president, after
which the commission called upon the
President in a body to pay their re
spects. Later they went to the State;
Department and called upon Secretary
Hay, with whom they discussed some
of the details and the plans of thri
work before them.
Subsequently the commission held a
meeting at which there was a general
exchange of views regarding the work
before them, but no decision was
reached upon any point and the com
mission adjourned until to-morrow.
The magnitude of the work before them
is fully realized by the members, and
they propose to make a moat deliberate
survey of the situation before matur
ing their plans.
All the members of the commission
are anxious that the work be pushed
with the greatest possible expedition
in the hope that a report can be sub
mitted upon which Congress at its next
session can act.
The commission spent several hours
altogether in general iliscnission and an
interchange of views between individ
ual members on various phases of the
project. The probable inability of the
commission to accomplish its work and
draft its report in time to submit to
Congress the coming winter was re
ferred to, &nd the opinion expressed
that the commission cannot dispose of
the preliminary portion of iis work,
make the careful de-tailed examinations
in the Held and return here and place
the results of the investigation, with
the accruing recommendations, in in
telligible shape before the session of
Congress beginning a year from next
December.
Two- reports will be carefully exam
ined, in all probability, before the com
mission starts for the isthmus. These
are the report of the last Nicaragua
Canal Commission, which unfortunate
ly is not yet in print, necessitating the
laborious task of individual examina
tion of the manuscript notes and maps,
and the report of the French commis
sion that had to do with the Investi
gation of the Panama route. Other data
Will be secured from various sources.
At to-morrow's meeting the question
of appointing a secretary and disburs
ing officer will probably be passed upo-n.
Later on appointments will be made of
chief engineer and a large corps of en
gineers to work in parties on various
routes. The last two or three Ameri
can commissions have devoted their at
tention exclusively to the Nicaraguan
Canal, so that the scope of the present
commission will necessarily involve a
large amount of work hitherto un
touched by our investigations. Parties
of engineers will be. put at work on
definite routes net already pronounced
Impracticable, and even an exception to
this possibly may be made. The com
mission's session to-day developed no
definite understanding as to when it
would start for the isthmus, that being
deferred for the present. It is thought,
however, that there will not be a delay
of more than a few weeks before the
actual work of the investigation is be
gun.
WATER COMPANY DEFIANT.
Refuses to be Bound by the Award
of Arbitrators.
LOS ANGELES, .Tune I.l.â The Lop An
geles Water Company has replied to the
resolution adopted by the City Council, in
which that body aocopte<i thf> award of
i tlie arbitrators and asked the company
I whether or not it would also accept the
, award.
This morninff Secretary Mott handed to
<"ity Clerk Hance a resolution adopted by
the directors of the water company and a
lrpral opinion rendered to the directors of
the company by the attorneys for the
company.- The opinion dedans that the
aHi Lrid award is not an award, because it
was agreed to by but two of the arbitrat
ors Instead of three, as provided In the
contract, and for this and other reasons
the directors refused to abide by the
decision of a majority of the arbitrators
Or to be bound by their award.

Railroad Scheme
Stopped Just

Corkscrew Franchise Is
Recommended With
Modifications.
THR Street Committee has finished
with the franchises; the north end
ers will grot what they want and
the railroad has been given all it will
bo given. The people are satisfied, the
hoard is satisfied and the railroad la as
satisfied as it ever is when It asks more
than it hopes to get and Rets just a lit
t!e mo\re than it deserves. Yesterday's
FPFSion of the committee settled the mat
ter; the corkscrew franchise was recom
mended for favorable action by the board
and the railroad will be allowed to ope
rate the line with an overhead electric
system. It was Intended to compel the
company to use the cable channels for an
underground system wherever, the fran
chise, r;tn along with an old cable road,
but the representative of the company
proclaimed that if the board should pass
an "underground franchise" it might a?
â well keep It, which had its weight with
the committee.
The Railroad avenue franchise was also

so fix it that there could be no escape
from just, local assessments." The fran
chise for a road which is to carry neither
passengers nor freight was granted but
the committee stopped it twenty feet in-
Bide the county line, and by bo doing al
lows the Assessor to retain jurisdiction
over it.
The corkscrew franchise was the sub
ject of much discussion, but it was con
fined to details and not to principles. The
committee would hear nothing of a ri^ht
of way on Geary street, and as passed
the. franchise leaves that thoroughfare
severely alone. It satisfies the property-
owners in the north end of town, how- i
tver. and the railroad also appears to be
willing to call it a bargain.
The corkscrew franchise is not a new
one, however, except in two places â on
Taylor street, between Post and Geary,
and on Sansome street from Jackson to
the bay. The Taylor street portion from
Market to (ieary was granted anew, be
cause the committee believed it had been :
forfeited by long disu.se, and it was be- '
Ueved that if it was considered the com
pany had a right to it. a precedent for,
the grabbing of other unused franchises
might be established. The line starts ',
at Brannan and Sixth streets and runs
along Sixth to Market. There is now be
ing operated a horsecar line over that .
right of way. Then it crosses Market
Btreet and taking up the line of the un- I
used franchise on Taylor street goes as j
far as Geary, where the old road turned â 
east and went down Geary over the cable '
track. Just there comes in one of the '
new pieces recommended â permission for |
a double track on Taylor street from
Geary, one block north to Post. At Poat
street the line will join the tracks already
there and being used by the Post-street
cable cars, and on these It will run down
â¢') Montgomery, where it will join the
horsecar tracks and run north on them ,
to Washington. It will go down Wash
ington street to Sansome, and then over
to Jackson, and there reach t he end of'
the present franchise. It is recommended
I;;.' the committee- that permission be j
granted for the. use of Saiisoiiiu street
from Jackson to the bay, the line to run
out and back on Sansom* street and then
on the return to run Up Jackson street to j
Montgomery and Join the double track on â 
Montgomery again at Washington.
As will be seen, the line as recommend- !
ed by the committee is but a joining of
franchises already allowed, and the only
privilege granted other than those men
tioned is the permission to use the over
head electric system on what is left of
the present Post-street system.
Referring to the franchises after the :
meeting of the committee the Mayor said: -
"The principal point of dispute was be
tween the overhead and the underground
'-Â. tri<- systems. J am in favor of under
ground electricity, and I mink the com
pany can W--11 afford on such streets as
Post, Montgomery and Sansome to lay
their wires underground. The privilege
recommended by ihe Street Committee I
gives the company the option, and the j
citizens should prevail upon the company i
to give Saji Francisco tnis service.
â¢These franchises might be called
piecemeal franchises and their life will j
be the same as tlmsi with which they j
connect. Thus, When they expire at t he i
same time, the city will have a valuable !
franchise either to own or' to sell.
"The other and objectionable franchises
wiil not be taken up. 1 believe the char- I
ter provisions will be substantially ex- '
acted, except the reversion of the rail '
and roadbed to the city, for which the
company will not staxid unless required
as told after January 1."
The Mayor was late in coming to the
meeting, and the committee occupied it
self considering graces, sewers and other
improvements. When his Honor entered
the matter of franchises waÂ« taken up i
and a lengthy discussion followed. Su
pervisor Aigeltinger, chairman of the
Street Committee, presided, and seated
around the table were Supervisors Hol

the committee. Supervisors Lackmann,

ested listeners. Henry H. Lynch, super
intendent of construction of the Market
Street Railway Company; H. H. Taylor,
agent for D. O. Mills, and Edgar Painter
were also present as representatives of
the property-owners in the northern part
of the city.
Clerk Russell read the following reso
lution, and after some amendments had
been added to it it was recommended for
favorable action:
Resolved, That permission 'is hereby granted
to the Market Street Railway Company to
operate by means of electricity, either over
head or underground, using modern improve
ments and appliances in the Judgment of the â¢
Board of Suijtervisors, or by such other means
as may be sanctioned by law all those certain
street railroads within the city and county of
San Francisco, for which said company Is now
the holder, by assignment from or succession
to the grantees either In name, of franchises
heretofore granted by the Board of Supervisors
of said city and county, upon the following
named streets and parts of streets, under the
expressed condition that ornamental iron poles
shall be erected on the outer edge of the side
walk within the curb lines, to wit:
â  Sixth street from Brannan street to Market
street, thence across Market street to Taylor
street, thence along Taylor street to Post street.
subject to a franchise being: granted across
Market street from Sixth street to Taylor street,
thence along Taylor to Post street; Montgomery
street from Market to Jackson street; Sansome
street from Jackson to Market street; Jackson
street from Montgomery to Sansome street;
Washington street from Montgomery to San
some street: Post street from Market ,to
Leaven worth street; Leavenworth street from
Post street, across McAllister street to City
Hall avenue; City Hall avenue from McAllister
street across Larkln street to Grove street;
Grove street from Larkin to Polk street; Polk
street from Grove street to Market street and I
across Market street to Tenth street: Tenth i
street from Market street to Bryant street.
During: the discussion between the
Mayor and Superintendent Lynch' on the
advisability of using underground elec
tricity, the latter emphatically informed
Mr. Phelan that if the board insisted
upon the discontinuance of overhead
wires the company he represented would
refuse to accept the franchise. Mr. Lynch
gave as his reason that an underground |
system would be too expensive.
Then followed a discussion on what I
kind of rail should be used In the down
town districts. The Mayor favored the
flat rail, but Mr. Lynch gave many rea
sons why it was Impracticable. This was
followed by an informal discussion on
who were entitled to ride free on the cars,
and it was learned that Uncle Sam pays
each year to the railroad company a fixed
sum, so that letter carriers may ride free
upon the cars while in the discharge of
their duty. As firemen and policemen are ;
allowed to ride without paying, the Mayor
thought members of the Health Depart
ment should also be allowed free rides, as
they were like policemen. The commit
tee did not deem the suggestion advisa
ble, as other city officials might feel ;
slighted if they were missed.
It was recommended that the following '
franchises be offered for sale by the
board, and that the clerk be ordered to
advertise for ten days for bids: .
Commencing at the Intersection of Jackson
and Sanoome streets and connecting with ex
isting tracks of thÂ» Market Street Railway j
Company on Sansome street, thence northerly .
along Sansome street to the northerly termina- j
tion thereof.
Commencing nt thÂ« intersection of Railroad
avenue and the northeasterly line of Sixteenth
avenue south, and connecting with existing
tracks of the Market Street Railway Company !
on Railroad avenue, thence southerly along |
Railroad avenue to San Bruno ave'nu<\ '
thence along San Bruno avenue and Mllllken
street, thence along Milllken street to a point
twenty feet distant from the county line.
Commencing nt the Intersection of Sixth and
Market streets and connecting with the line of
railroad of the Market Street Railway Company !
on Sixth street, thence across Market street !
to Taylor, thence along Taylor street to Its
Intersection with Post street, there connecting i
with the line of railroad of the Market Street
Railway Company on Post street.
These three new franchises include the
attempt on the county line, the single
block on Taylor street with the renewal i
of the old franchise, and the new right of
way on Sansome street. All of these were I
granted only for the period which is yet. I
to run on those franchises with which
they connect. In this way the eo'ire
franchise will expire in each case at the
same time, and the city will then have a
continuous and valuable right of way to
hold or to sell.
It is not expected that the recommenda- '
tions of the committee will be altered be- j
fore the board, and as a consequence the
franchise matters will soon be settled.

JUDGE GRAHAM ATTACKED.
He Is Unjustly Accused of Favoring
the Southern Pacific in a Dis
turbance of the Peace Case.
The arrest of Henry Harris, a drummer,
at the ferry last Friday for refusing to
pay the merchandise charge for a pack
age he was carrying and thereby dis
turbing the peace led to considerable talk
in Judge Graham's court yesterday. At
torney Davis appeared and apologized to
the Judge for erroneous statements made
In a morning paper as to the Judge's
actions, which appeared to have been in
stigated by him.
The facts were that when the case was
called la-st Saturday the defendnnt waived
a jury, and when It was called Wednes
day he demanded a jury and the Judge
so ordered, fixing the trial for August 18,
aa he was shortly to leave on his vaca
tlon. He also ordered the defendant re^
leased on his own recognizance.
The charge against Harris Is disturb
ing the peace, but incidentally he is want
ing the public to know that in his opinion
the Southern Pacific has no right to
charge a merchandise rate for a package.
The company says that there is never
any charge for bundles, but when a
Benger carries a package of pure mer
chandise the charge will be enforced.

ESTIMATED EXPENSE
OF AN EXTRA SESSION
Picnic for a Hungry Horde of
Legislators Would Cost a Vast Sum.
An Attache of the Senate Figures the Amount of Money
That Burns Would Have to Spend on a Cash
Basis to Make Sure of Election.
1 There Is po much gossip concerning an J
extra session and there are so many in- â¢
dications that Governor Gage will yield !
to the pressure of Dan Burns, Herrin and
the followers of the Mexican and call
the members of the Legislature together
that The Call makes an estimate of the
expense to the taxpayers of a' special ses
sion.
It may be reckoned as a certainty that ,
the length of the session will not be less ;
than thirty days. Events may occur j
which would prolong the session to ninety :
days. The expense on a thirty days' ba- |
sis may be figured as follows:
Per diem and mileage of Senators $12,000 â 
Per diem and mileage of Assemblymen.. 27,000 i
Pay of officers and clerks of the Senate.. 9,000
Pay of officers and clerks of the Assem- '-tnntM
bly 11,000
Contingent expenses of the Senate 15,000
Contingent expenses of the Assembly.... 20.001
For stationery. light and other supplies.. 10,000
For State Printing Office 25,000
Total ' $129,
Should the length of the session be ex- j
tended to sixty days the expense would
be nearly doubled, in fact doubled in ev
ery particular save that of mileage. It
may be figured, therefore, that a sixty ;
days' session would cost $250,000, and a
ninety days' session $379,000.
The legislature, once convened in extra
session, can adjourn at its sweet will. The '
constitution limits the pay of the regu- j
lar biennial session to a period of sixty
days. If the members remain after the
expiration of sixty days they do not draw
pay from the State. They can appropri- j

POLICEMEN PUT IN
A DAY KILLING CATS
SERGEANT CAMPBELL and five
of the finest from the Seven
teenth street police station went
r;it hunting yesterday. The re
sult nf their marksmanship Is
buried under three feet, of earth
on a sunny slope In the Mission. Four
lowly mounds in a row have been
raised to mark the last resting places
of four felines, one Thomas and three
Tabby cats that only a few short hours
ago were careless caterwaulers. At
the head of the largest mound a plain
redwood board has been placed. Upon
it has been cut the following inscrip
tion:

THOMAS SCAT.
Cruelly Murdered by
POLICEMAN CRACKBON,
June 15. 1899.
REQUIES CAT.
Thp victims of the cruel Campbell
and his .sanguinary squad, oats though
they were, met dogs' deaths. They
were shot down in cold blood, without
a moment's warning. They were lured

otlifr. This scheme can be worked In an
i extra as well as in a regular session.
When an extra session convenes the
members and attaches begin to draw
pay from the treasury, and they continue
on the payroll until the body adjourns.
! The Legislature can only act on Buch BUb-
I jects as the proclamation specifies, but
I every topic under the shining sun can be
1 discussed.
The Governor cannot prorogue or dis
i band the legislature, but he may advise
j the members to finish the business and
I adjourn. The members, on the other
j hand, can advise the Governor to keep

mertime at Sacramento. Apart from the
subject of the Senatorship an extra ses
sion would be a great and glorious picnic
I for the Cospers, the Simpsons, the
' Wrights, the Dibbles, the Jilsons, the
Kenneallya and the Johnson?.
The Call is informed that an estimate
has been made of the amount of money
that Burns would lie required to expend
in order to secure his election. The sum
is placed at $280,000. This estimate was
i prepared by a well-known attache of the
| Senate. Tt is assumed that gold bricks
will be eliminated entirely from the cal
culation, and that the contest will be
: conducted on a straight cash basis. The
question that now perplexes the backers

amount of money?"

Turned the Tables on Him.
W. H. Nicks, a six-footer, was; arrested
yesterday by Policeman Beach and hook
: ed at the City Prison on a charge of grand
| larceny. Ho is accused of breaking into
! the trunk of Mrs. Nettie Taylor. 740 How
ard street, and stealing a lot of clothing
I belonging to her husband, a soldier in
I Manila, valued at $80. Nicks lived in the
j house with Myrtle Mitchell and Wednes
i day he reported to the police that she
had left him and stolen a I"t of articles.
When Myrtle heard of it she told Mrs.
to the shambles and slaughtered un
der false pretenses. .They went with
out benefit of clergy, their only re
quiem being the "zip" of the bullets
that carried death. Their lifeless bod
ies were dragged crosslots to paupers'
gravesâ to the catacombs, as It were,
of Caselli avenue.
The four unfortunate felines wore
vagrants. They had never had the
opportunity of trying the American
plan of living. From kittenhood their
existence had been a sort of hop. skip
and a Jump struggle for the veriest
scraps of victual. They took tholr
meals as they could on the European
plan and slept on the dumps with one
eye open.
For one brief period before their
wretched existences were closed the
Tommy and the three Tabbies had a
peep at the lard of plenty. This was
given several days ago, when the au
thorities at the Maclean Hospital
chloroformed the cats of that quar
antined establishment through the
fear that they might carry infection
to the neighborhood and precipi
tate an epidemic of smallpox on the
city.
As a consequence of this taking off
there was an overplus of juicy scraps
from the hospital tables, which were
placed in receptacles in the back yard.
The keen scent of the vagrant cats
soon smelled out these dainties, and
the result was that the whole band of
masterless felines invaded the yard
in pursuit of the leavings. They were
the heirs of the chloroformed cats,
and like all heirs they quarreled over
the funeral meats.
Their quarreling was their undoing.
It focused the attention of the hospital
management to their presence. The

result was that the police were notified
that the same danger of infection for
which the Maclean cats wore asphyx
iated would exist if the feline waifs
were not driven away. The police re
solved to kill them off and make sure
that they would communicate no germs
by their wanderings.
Early yesterday morning Patrolman
J. Crackbon. William Doran, J. J.
Nyhan. J. Porter and T. M. Waller
were picked out as executioners. Ser
geant Campbell, like the masterful
general he is, ordered them Into ;>luln
clothes, so that they could steal up
unnoticed and plug any old cat that
ventured over the deadline. The men
were stationed at various vantage
points, and assuming the most ai-
proved Creedmoor attitudes thny iev
eled their howitzers and awaited de
velopments.
The details of the catastrophe were
too much even for a policeman. The
tally shows that Crackbon got away
with the honors, potting the three
Tabbies and nailing the Tom on the
wing just as he was preparing to swal
low the remnants of a rib steak. The
other policemen got nothing. Just as
the sun went down Officers Waller and
Nyhan threw the last spadeful of dirt
over the remains of the fourth feline,
Doran whistling "The Cat Came Back"
as a dead march, while Officer Porter,
who is no relative of the man in the
song, cut the inscription for Thomas
Scat. Then Sergeant Campbell and
his men were disinfected and made
their way to the station in an atmos
phere of germ killer.
More felines will be slaughtered to
day if they and the opportunities pre
sent themselves in the vicinity of the
hospital.

SONG RECITAL BY
DAISY MAE CRESSY
AN INTERESTING AND VARIED
MUSICAL PROGRAMME.
The Talented Vocalist Is Assisted by
Armand Solomon, Violinist, and
Miss Thercse Brooks,
Pianiste.
The song recital given last night by
Miss Daisy Mac Creasy at Sherman, Clay
& Co. Music Hall drew a large attend
ance and was an emphatic success.
Miss Creasy has just returned from a
three years' course in vocal studies in
Eastern institutions, and her voice
showed vast improvement. She is ambi
tious to appear on the operatic stage and
she seems to be well fitted both in stage
presence and vocal ability to carry out
her desires. She has resumed her posi
tion as contralto of the First Presbyterian
i Church, replacing Mrs. Olive Reed Cush
] man, who has gone to New York to lo-
I cate permanently.
Miss Creasy presented some delightful
j old French songs, besides several other
j numbers, and her rendition of the "Grand
I Aria" from Meyerbeer's "Le Profeta" ex
hibited her voice Jin its full beauty. She
j sings with great ease and self-control,
j and is especially notable in the tender
| passages.'. She quite won her audi-
I tors by her singing of a "Lullai>> " dedi
j cated to her by George Corwin Stout, and
intended to bring out her lower notes,
which are round and full.
Miss Creasy was ably assisted by Ar
man Solomon, violinist, and Miss The
i rese Brooks, pianist.
The programme in detail was as fol

Caroline Homer Secures a Warrant

Caroline Homer, 317 Hyde street, swore
