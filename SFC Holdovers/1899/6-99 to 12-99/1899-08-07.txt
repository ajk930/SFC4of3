BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Aug. 6.â
Nearly forty persons were killed
by an accident on the Stratford
extension of the Sheltori-street
Railway Company at 4 o'clock
this afternoon, when a loaded trolley

Frank Kratt, Bridgeport, injuries about
head and back; Arthur Holmes. Bridge
port, contusion on left side and left leg*.
Frank Hillercus, scalp wound, bruised
about body; Matthew Olvin. scalp
wound, cut and bruised generally.
The scene of the accident is midway
between Shelton and Bridgeport. The
car was northward bound, running to
ward Shelton. It was in charge of
Conductor John Carroll of Bridgeport,
who was among the killed, and Motor
man Hamilton of Bridgeport, who
escaped by jumping.
The trestle is 440 feet long, made of
Iron, with stone foundations, and was
not protected by guard rails. South
of the trestle is an incline, down which
the car ran at a high rate of speed.
After It ran on the trestle for about ten
feet the trucks left the rails", then the
car continued on the ties for about sev
enty-five feet, when it went off the
trestle and dropped into the pond be
low, overturning completely and up
ending.
When the car struck the four-ton
motor and the heavy trucks crashed
into it, instantly killing many of the
passengers. Three physicians who
were passengers on a car a short dis
tance behind arrived on the scene and
rendered all possible assistance to the
injured.
Word was sent to Bridgeport and
three ambulances and a police wagon
were hurried to the scene, and the In
jured were taken to the Bridgeport
Genera] Hospital. A morgue was im
provised in the main room of the Town
Hall at Stratford, and in a very short
time twenty-three bodies were laid out
awaiting identification.
The accident was witnessed by Miss
Frances S. Peck, who resides about 400
fret from the bridge. She was upstairs
at her home as the car was passing.
She says that it was running at an un
usually fast rate. Frank Cramer, who
was bathing near the bridge, states that
the passengers were all singing and in
the most joyful mood as they passed
him.
The road, which is practically con
trolled by the Bridgeport Traction
Company, was opened for traffic last
Thursday.
Almost the entire medical force of
Bridgeport responded to telephone
calls, but when the doctors arrived
they were unable to do much for the
few passengers who escaped Instant
death. The car, after up-ending, soon
settled over on its side, and there was
little difficulty in removing the bodies
of the dead, as well as assisting the
wounded.
Motorrnan Hamilton is suffering from
such a severe shock that it is Impos
sible to learn anything from him to
night. v
President Andrew Radell of the rail
The San Francisco Call.
way company stated that it was im
possible for him to account for the ac
cident. Immediately after his ar
rival at the scene he made a thorough
inspection of the tracks and trestle,
and could see nothing wrong, and cars
were running over the trestle as usual
soon afterward. He denied that the
cars were run at a high rate of speed,
and claimed that every possible pre
caution had been taken to prevent ac
cidents.
One theory advanced is that faulty
connection was responsible for the ac
cident. At the point where the cars
leave the road for the trestle it is al
leged that the rails had sunk a little,
and though the forward trucks took
the rails all right the rear trucks did
not connect, and jumped the track,
which caused the forward trucks to
also leave the iron. It is believed that
if proper guard rails had been placed
on the trestle the car would have been
prevented from toppling over.
All of the persons killed sustained
fractured skulls. William Kelly of
Bridgeport, who was in company with
Miss Farrell, escaped death by jump
ing from the car as he felt it swaying
to the flats below. Soon afterward the
car toppled over. He sustained a se
vere shock, but was not otherwise in
jured. He stated to-night that the car
was not running unusually fast, but
that it was swaying considerably when
It struck the trestle and he realized the
danger and knew his only safety was
in jumping.
George Willis of Shelton was on the
highway not more than 100 feet from
the scene and witnessed the car top
pling over. He said that there was one
unearthly shriek as it went down, and
after that silence.
Miss Frances Peck, who was dress
ing in her room, saw the accident from
her window, and it is her impression
that the car was running very fast.
She was so excited that she could give
but meager information, but avers that
the car was swaying considerably as it
reached the trestle.
One of the pathetic scenes was that
of a lifeless baby reclining in the arms
of a dead man, the infant appearing
to be smiling and asleep. The three
year-old son of Mrs. John H. Rugg was
frantically appealing to his dead
mother. His sister, five years old, had
her left arm broken.
The Stratford town hall, where the
bodies were taken, was soon besieged
by more than 1000 persons, some of
whom had relatives or friends among
the dead, and the deputy sheriffs in
charge had much difficulty in handling
the crowd of weeping women and anx
ious men.
All the bodies of the Bridgeport dead
and the few unidentified were taken
to the Morgue at Bridgeport late to
night.
It has been ascertained that forty
fares were registered, and these, with
the young children that did not have to
pay, the motrman and the conductor,
and* an extra motorrnan, who was be
ing taught, make the proable number
on the car forty-seven.
HORRORS OF THE
JUVISY COLLISION
PARIS, Aug. 6.â The official Investi
gation into the collision last evening at
Juvisy, a suburb of Paris on the south
ern side, between the Orleans line
Paris and Nantes train and the Paris
and Lyons Mediterranean train, shows
thai seventeen persons were killed and
seventy-three injured.
The collision occurred during a ter
rific thunderstorm, and it is supposed
the electric current may have been re
sponsible for the defective signaling.
The first train was at a standstill and
the second came down upon it at the
rate of fifty miles an hour. The loco
motive of the latter crashed through
the brake van of the former and tele
scoped three of the passenger cars.
The moving train was not injured.
Heart-rending screams and cries for
assistance filled the air. but the pas
sengers were so massed in by debris
that they were extricated only after the
greatest difficulty. All three carriages
were crowded with excursionists.
MOTORMAN KILLED

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAR HARBOR, Me., Aug. 6.â A
score of persons were killed to
day by the breaking of the gang
plank of the Mount Desert ferry.
Seventeen were drowned, and
three died from the terrible experience
of immersion in the water and in
juries while struggling for life.

The Maine Central Railroad to-day
ran excursions to. Bar Harbor from all
sections of its line in Maine, the at
traction being the warships which
were expected to-day.
All the morning long trains packed
with excursionists were rushing to
Bar Harbor. The train which left Ban
gor at 8:25 consisted of twelve cars
jammed with people. At Mount Des
ert Ferry, the terminus of the line, the
train is left for the boat for an
eighteen-mile sail to Bar Harbor. From
the wharf a slip, or gang-plank, forty
feet long and ten feet wide ran out to
the boat. The slip was hinged at the
inner end, and was raised or lowered to
suit the tide. The wharf extends on
both sides flush with the end of the
wooden gang-plank. Five timbers. 4x
12 inches, set vertically, ran the length
of the plank, and these were crossed by
twer-inch planks. It is said there was no
support for the plank between the
hinges at the outer end.
When the excursion train from Ban
gor arrived at the ferry there was a
rush for the steamer Sappho. The first
few passengers had crossed the gang
plank safely, and it is estimated that
200 people were massed on the plank.
Suddenly they felt the plank give way
beneath them. The long timber sup
porting the plank broke in the middle.
The hinges held up one end and the
chain the other, while the broken ends
of the plank dropped, and a struggling,
screaming mass of humanity was
plunged into the water, fifteen feet be
low the wharf. A few clung to the in
clined sides of the plank, but at least
150 were struggling in the water. The
piling of the wharf partly penned them
on three sides, and the boat lying at
the wharf closed the outer end of the
opening.
After the first moment of stupefac
tion the work of rescue began. Ropes
and life-preservers were thrown to the
crowd, but in the panic the people in
the water clutched one another, and
many sank thus in groups in a death
grip.
The awful nature of the accident was
not comprehended for at least a minute
by those who vere the last to leave the
train, although the scene changed in
stantly from one of holiday gayety to
a death struggle. When the first mo
ment of the calamity had passed a
panic seemed to have seized those who
were safe, and they drey back from
the edge of the water, but only for a
minute, as the cooler heads In the
crowd, especially amot* the officers
and crew of the steamer, asserted
themselves and the work of rescue be
gan. 'â 
Eye-witnesses differ in their estimate
of the number of people who were car
ried down when the plank broke, but it
was the vanguard of the crowd which
was rushin-r from the train to the
.steamer. Those who fell into the
water last were mostly pulled out by
main force, but not a few were got
out by boats which were immediately
manned. There was wild excitement
on land, for each excursionist was
rushing in and out among his or her
neighbors in quest of relatives and
friends. In the hurry and bustle of
alighting from the train husbands,
wives, parents and children had be
came separated, and separation at that
moment meant heart-breaking sus
pense. Mrs. Estey, one of the victims,
was one of those who, while only apart
from her husband a few feet, lost her
life, while Mr. Estey was saved, al
though thrown into the water.
In the course of the next half hour
several bodies were recovered and were
taken to the near-by freight house and
laid out awaiting identification. It was
a grewsome sight and a pitiful one as
identifications were made.
The steamer Cymbria came from Bar
I Harbor with four physicians and a
i special train was hurried from Bangor
: with physicians and nurses. President
Wilson of the Maine Central Railroad
was near at hand when the disaster oc
curred, and he gave orders to spare no
exertion in relieving the distress. Many
persons had been injured in the strug
gle on the edge of the Wharf and in the
water, and such - these as needed im
mediate attention were taken to the
high bluffs near the station and waited
on by the physicians.
The sufferers from injuries will not
be as numerous as those who suffered
| from shock and exposure due to the
I immersion in the water. Of these sev
eral were reported to-night to be in a
critical state. Miss : **eeney of Bangor
was taken to the Hotel Bluffs, suffer
ing from pneumoni -eorge Spauld
ing of Orono is . jo at the Bluffs and
may not recover: Mrs. George Brooks
of Ellsworth will recover, although her
case was once pronounced hopeless.
After the bodies in the freight house
had been identified, the Coroner gave
permission to have them removed, and
relatives and friends soon arter took
each in charge and attended them to
their respective homes. Â§
Many were taken from the water un
conscious and were revived with diffi
culty. Doctors were summoned from
all directions, but it was half an hour
before the first arrived. The freight
house at the ferry was turned into a
morgue, the bodies being taken there
for identification as fast as recovered.
The Coroner impaneled a jury and
the inquest will begin in the morning.
LIQUOR AND
LOVE LEAD
TO TRAGEDY
Aged Wesley Brown Slays
the Wife He Had Driven
From Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CASTELLA, Aug. Because his
drunkenness and brutal treatment had
driven his wife from his home and he
could not induce her to return, aged
Wesley G. Brown shot and killed the
woman this morning. Then he fired
a bullet into his own brain.
The Browns lived at Wolfe Creek, Or.
The maiden name of the wife was Sa
rah Elizabeth Weeks, and her relatives
resided at University Station, Los An
geles. Brown was nearly 70 years of
age. He had worked here for some
time in the employ of Conway & Wil
son, merchants and forwarding agents.
Sixteen months ago his wife, who was
60 years of age, left him because of his
drunkenness and went to live at Whee
ler's sawmill, several miles away, with
her daughter by a former marriage,
Mrs. W. C. Suggs. Brown had followed
his wife from Wolfe Creek, working at
any kind of labor until he reached the
Wheeler mill near here on Saturday.
There he found his wife with her
daughter. He made overtures for her
to return and live with him. As he was
intoxicated at the time, Mrs. Brown
feared trouble and arranged to take
the northbound passenger train at Cas
tella this morning.
When she was nearing the county
road in company with W. C. Suggs,
Brown suddenly appeared from the
I bushes and asked to have a word with
j her. As she stepped aside he drew
i a revolver and began firing at her. The
j first shot took effect in the stomach and
! as she turned to run two bullets took
effect in her back, one lodging in the
heart. Suggs, who was unarmed, was
shot at twice, both missing him.
Then Brown fired at himself, .he bul
let entering just above the right ear.
He lingered unconscious until noon.
The inquest was held to-night, the
testimony -inging out the facts here
recorded.

RENNES, Aug. The town is ex
tremely animated to-day, but
everywhere perfect tranquility
prevails. Public interest is con
centrated upon the arrival from Paris
of various personages likely to figure

AUSTIN. Tex., Aug. 6.â A special re
ceived here to-day from Terrazas. Chi
hauhau. Mex.. which Is located near the
scene of the Yaqui rising, is to the effect
that the Indians are arranging for a pro
longed war. The special says:
"It is going to take the Mexican Gov-.

force of troops to quell the rebellion. The
Yaquis are better prepared now than ever
before for a long and bloody campaign.
They are all well fixed financially, nearly
all of them having saved the $200 per head
which the Mexican Government paid them
when they signed the treaty of peace two
years ago. They have been making
money since then, too, and It Is known
to be a fact that they have been laying in
big supplies of arms and ammunition for
some time past. It has been common talk
among the American prospectors in the
Yaqui Valley that, the Indians were pre
paring for another outbreak, but as the
braves had always shown a friendly spirit
toward the Americans, It was thought
they would not molest them when they
did go on the warpath.. They are.deter

ST. LOUIS. Aug. 6.â A special to the
Republic from Austin, Tex., says: In

ZANGWILL SPEAKS
OF ANTI-SEMITISM
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. .6. â Israel
Zangwill, the London novelist and
critic, said to-day regarding the ex
clusion of Hebrews from the Oriental
Hotel at Manhattan Beach: "If the
Dreyfus germ should ever gain a foot
hold in America it would be due to
such men as Austin Corbin. What does
he mean by the phrase, 'Hebrews as a
class?' There is no such thing as 'He
brews as a class.' You might just as
well say Americans or Englishmen 'as
a class.' Let Mr. Corbin object to in
dividuals if he so pleases, but let him
not label them as a class, for there is
no such thing. If he wishes to convey
by that idea that the average Hebrew
is a less desirable guest of his hotel
than the .average Christian,; I think he
would have great difficulty in proving
it. ' ..
"This latest manifestation of anti-
Semitism, if it should gain any ground
in 'America, would hurt America more
than -the- Jews, as -it hurts the ideals
which underlie the American constitu
tion. A Jewish paper not long ago, in
commenting upon the death of a prom
inent Jew, whose many good deeds
were known to very few, and whose life
was wholly inconspicuous,' pertinently
' asked: 'Why is it ' that a * flaunting,
vaunting Jew is picked out as a type
rather than a man of this character?'
, "That is a question which' I, too,
should like to have answered. I be
lieve It' would throw considerable light
on this question of anti-Semitism and
on the real motives which underlie It."
during the past two hundred years. The
first attempt to conquer them was made
in' l727,* when a large force of Spanish
troops was sent against them. The latter
were quickly -defeated. In 1549 another
large expedition was sent against these
'Indians, and it also met defeat. Another
â¢unsuccessful effort was made to subdue
the Mayas in ISSI. a force of several thou
sand men being sent against them. The
Indians since then have lived at : peace
with the authorities until a few years
ago, .when they made attacks on a num
ber of Mexican settlers, who had located
within the confines of their territory.
These settlers were murdered and their
' property confiscated by the Indians.
Many raids have been made on innocent
.settlers since then. ", .' 'â 
The Mexican Government began mak
ing preparations several months ago for
a campaign of extermination against the
tribe. . The campaign is now about ready
to open. The details of the campaign have
been formulated by President Porifiro
Diaz, and he ' has directed his intimate
personal friend and military adviser,
Brigadier General Ortiz Monastero, to
take charge of the military movement.
General Monastero is now on his way to
Belize to join the invading forces.
Over fifteen thousand soldiers and ten
small gunboats are being massed on the
Indian frontier. The gunboats are being
sent up the rivers Hondo and Belize. The
concerted attack on the Indians will be
gin the latter part of this month. The
Mayas are well aware of the gigantic mil
itary movement that is being prepared
against them and they are not idle. It
is reported they are well armed and
equipped for desperate resistance. The
Government is establishing a base of sup

LEGAL BLOW TO

Checks the Shipments
of War Munitions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6. â Hon. John
Goodnow, Consul General of the United
States at Shanghai, nas rendered a deci
sion as referee in the Consular Court
â¢which will be of far-reaching importance
during the .continuance of the war in the
Philippines. The case was in relation to
the steamer Abbey, charged with taking
arms from Canton to Luzon. It has been
in contention for some time. The owners
of the vessel gave bond that th- ship
should land the arms purchased at Singa
pore, but she did not do so. The bond was
demanded by the Chinese authorities. Mr.
uoodnow holds that it must be paid. The
importance of the decision is pointed out
by the Shanghai Mercury, which says:
The effect of the decision of Mr. -Goodnow
rea-'hes much beyond the mere "fact of being
Judgment for the plaintiff, with the penalty
followin. and the costs of the suit. .-â â¢ Hitherto
the American forces at Manila have, had to
r-. j_' ; ; against Filipinos well armed with mod
ern rifles and guns, and it .- no secret that
the majority of these arms have been landed
in the Philippines from Chinese ports. When
United States Consular oi'flcials have received
Information that cargoes Of weapons were
about to be shipped from China, their urgent
protests to the Chinese have been the means
of stopping shipments. But when the United
States officials, through want of knowledge,
have been ignorant of such contraband runs,
the Chinese officials have likewise been blind
to these shipments, thoueh no doubt well aware
of such.
It la in this respect that Mr. Goodnow has
scored such an Important point. On the
strength of that Judgment the officers of the
Imperial maritime customs of China must nec
essarily do all in their power to stop ship
ments of arms to suspicious destinations. It
has been decided on the motion of the cus
toms that China Is liable for any shipments of
arms which get to the Philippines through lack
of diligence or honesty on the part of the cus
toms or the Chinese officials. Therefore, the
Judgment in the Drew vs. Sylvester case will
be the means of checking the chief source of
supply of arms and warlike material that the
Filipinos have possessed.
The North China Daily News publishes
the decision of Consul Goodnow in full
and comments editorially upon its impor
tance and says it will bo far-reaching in its
effect in stopping the sending of arms to
the Filipinos.

with 200 persons on board, narrowly
escaped foundering in midlake last night.
The steamer was bound for Milwaukee,
and was thirty-five miles out in the lake
when a large amount of water was dis

was unable to start the pumps.
When the water was within two inches
of the fires the steamer was turned
around and headed for South Haven. The
passengers were awakened and told to
prepare themselves for what might hap

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6.â A horrible
murder was committed to-day in the
northeastern part of the city. The
murderer was Benjamin J. Snell, a
special examiner in the Pension Oflice,
a man about 45 years old. His victim
was Liza Weissenberger, a girl 13
years of age, who had been employed
in his household until a few months
ago, when she was taken home by her
parents, who became suspicious of
Snell's conduct toward her. Snell
seemed to be infatuated with the child
and paid her a great deal of attention,
which, however, she resented.
This morning Snell went to his vic
tim's house, and entering* at the front
door passed on through the middle
room, where the girl was sleeping, to
the dining room door. The mother
ordered him from the house, and Snell
started to go, passing again through
: the room where the child was. He
bent over the sleeping child and drew
! her from the bed. Awakened sud
denly, she screamed in terror. Twist
ing one hand in the girl's hair and
throwing back her head, Snell drew a
razor from his pocket and : swept it
: across her throat. Twice he slashed
' her throat and once he missed, cutting
! a great piece of flesh from her cheek.
The bead was almost severed from the
I body, and both the murderer and his
: victim were drenched with blood. * !
Attracted by the child's screams the
mother ran to the rescue. In a frenzy
she grappled with the murderer, and
was badly slashed on the arm with the
razor. The murderer attempted to
escape, but was soon captured by the
police and locked up in the Ninth Pre
cinct Station. He refuses to give any
explanation of his act. and says he re
members nothing about the murder.-
The murderer is a native of Vermont
and was at one time employed in a
bank at Montgomery, Ala. He has ,a.
wife and two children.
STREET 'RAILWAY MEN . ,

Tacit Agreement Reached by ths
Employes of the Stockton
System.
STOCKTON, Aug. 6.â A tacit agreement
is said to have been arrived at by the
street railway, employes to refuse to pay
for bonds in a surety company, and if the
company posts a formal order for them
to do so they will strike. The men pro-
pose to conduct their contest in an or
derly fashion and on lines which will en
list the sympathy of the people. They
claim they are underpaid now and cannot
afford to pay for espionage on themselves.
Under the bond arrangement the surety
company would provide spies, saving the
streetcar company the expense at present
falling to it. * â â -â¢â  â â .*:
The men do not demand anything; they
simply refuse to bear the expense imposed
by the company. They do not intend to
injure any company property. Bach man
will take his car to the barn, and will
not go near any company property or in
terfere with any arrangements, the com
pany may make in an effort to operate
the lines. The men will, however, procure
carryalls and buses and operate thtir
own vehicles on streets whore the car
lines are. They will appeal to the people
and turn over to officers any man who
violates in any way the rights of the com

ANOTHER TEST OF
MARCONI'S SYSTEM
Communication From a
Balloon.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 6.â There has been gen
eral and widespread interest in naval
circles on account of the free use of Mar
coni's system of wireless telegraphy.
Naval maneuvers have shown the value
of wireless telegraphy in war. The Rev.
J. M. Tacon and Messrs. J. X. and X.
Mask* lyne recently carried out a series of
interesting experiments in wireless
telegraphy with a balloon, which is likely
to prove even more valuable to peaceful
mariners.
As la well known, the safety of the
navigator and his vessel frequently de
pends upon warnings conveyed from time
to time by sound. All kinds of abnormal
deviations in the apparent direction from
which the sound emanates are noticed.
In short, the mariner is brought face to
face with all the peculiarities of atmos
pheric acoustics. The Tacon and Maske
lyne experiments were devised with the
object. of ascertaining precisely what is
the nature of these peculiarities, and what
are the conditions- under which they are
observed. When these results have been
secured scientists will be in a position to
provide a remedy for the errors men
tioned.
The balloon ascent was made from New
bury at 6 o'clock in the evening on July
27. The balloon rose rapidly, drifted away
in the direction of Reading and was
quickly lost to sight in the clouds, from
which it did not emerge for some minutes,
when it finally appeared as a speck in the
distance. â 'â  --"-â¢..
In the meantime Mr. X. Maskelyne
transmitted several messages to the oc
cupants of the balloon, who gave signals
that they were being received.
Heavy gun-cotton cartridges, suspended
below the car of the balloon, were fired
from the electric station on the ground
when the balloon was some miles distant,
and there were similar discharges from
the electric station, which shook the
ground.
Another experiment was the firing of a
powder magazine electrically from a dis
tant point, .without contact, the firing
point being the transmitting station be
tween which balloon communication
was maintained when the ascent took
place.
The object of this experiment was to
give a practical demonstration of the pos
sibility of utilizing the principle of
aetheric communication in time of war to
explode mines and similar destructive con
trivances, the only connection necessary
being through the medium of the all-per
vading ether.
The advantages of this system are that
there will be no connecting wires to be
cut by the enemy,' nothing 'which could
fall into their hands, while nothing could
prevent communication from being estab
lished at the right moment.
The initial experiment proved a perfect
success. fc '-â  â â¢

keeping.
CANTON, Auk. 6.â President McKin
ley has purchased the famous "McKinley
cottage" at the corner of North Market
street and Louis avenue. The considera
tion was $14,500. He will secure possession
of the contract and deed October next.
The property was not in the market. It
was endeared to President and Mrs. Mc-
Kinley as their first home, where they
began housekeeping and by tender memor
ies of sorrows there. The lot is 100 feet
front on Market street, by 244 on Louis
avenue.
The front veranda shows the most wear
from the historic campaign of 1596, when
the noted home was the political Mecca
for nearly a million people.
Before leaving Canton for the inaugura
tion. President McKinley tried to buy the
home made doubly dear to him. It is not
believed that Mrs. Harter would have
sold the place to any one else. It is be
lieved to be the President's intention to
spend a part of each summer in Canton.
Many Cantonians have expressed a fear
that with the breaking of home ties by
deaths, sorrows and other events, the
President might be induced to accept one
of the many invitations which the papers
have reported as being offered to secure
his residence elsewhere. The news that
the deal is closed whereby he is once mors
the owner of the home that has always
been dearest to him will be received with
universal rejoicing. â tftf^i

He Visits His Victim's Place of Busi

Him of His Ready
< Cash. .
One of the boldest robberies that has
come to the notice of the police for some
time was committed on Saturday night In
a barber shop kept by VincenzO Fistrano
at Golden Gate avenue and Hyde street.
Shortly after 9 o'clock, when the propri- i
etor was busily engaged in shaving one of
his customers, a stranger entered the
place and after displaying a special offi
cer's star informer Fistrano that he was |
under arrest. There were several men in ;
the shop awaiting their turn at the time.
and as the stranrer reached menacingly
for his revolver the> started to leave the ;
place. Fistrano became so nervous that
he was unable to continue shaving the
man who was in the chair, and tearing
that the excited barber would cut his j
throat, the customer sprang from the |
chair half-shaven and hurriedly left the ;
-
The robber, evidently satisfied that the i
men would not return, ordered Fistr to t
put on his coat.
â¢â¢You had better take all your valuables
â with you." coolly remark the desper
ado, again reaching for his revolver: |
â¢'you're up against it this time. '
Thinking that the man was a poll of
ficer. Fistrano dumped the tents of
the cash drawer into his pockets and an
nounced that he as ready to accom

Prison. As they reached the ''â¢"â¢' the
robber stood the barber up and relieved
him of the money, amounting to $22. He
tl-.en left, after informing his victim that
he would turn In a few minutes and
take him to police headquarters.
After waiting for some time, and as The
stranger did not return. Fistrano notified
Policeman Welch, whose beat is in the
vicinity. Welch located the robber in a
saloon at Sutter and Polk streets nml
placed him under arrest. He attempted <
to get rid of the star he wore while com- .
mining the robbery, but was prevented
by the officer. At the City Prison he was

NO SURGEONS AT THE PARK.
Hospital Remained Closed Yesterday.
-â¢Weyler*' Wakes Up at the
Chutes.
Unusual vigilance was kept by the park
police yesterday, for had an accident of
serious nature occurred doubtless they
would have had to report a death through
delayed medical attendance. Notwith
standing the fact that the crowds at the
park were large, the drive crowded and
wheelmen out by the hundreds. the
emergency hospital remained closed dur
ing the entire day. Considerable criticism
was the result. It was the mention of
many that had the Board of Health so de
sired they could have strained a point
and on the weekly holiday kept at least
one physician at the hospital, but as
thp board is endeavoring to make a play
to the gallery, or rather the public treas
ury, at the expense of an indulgent pub
lic, there was no place in the whole park
where even a sliver could be removed.
Fortunately no accidents occurred, or if
there were they 'were not reported and
the victims taken oyer the hills to the
City and County Hospital.
The usual crowd assembled at the
Chutes and among the visitors several
experienced a pleasant surprise. For some
days *'Weyler." the monster alligator, has
been enjoying a nap. On his back the
mud had caked and spiders spun their
webs across the volutions of his hide.
Hence the uninitiated believed that the
stuffed skin of one of these monsters had
been thrown Into the tank to sate the
curiosity of the Interested. "Weyler"
woke up yesterday, however, turned a
-â¢ v. graceful twists- in th.' tank, threw his
mouth open about a yard and climbed out.
The rest of the day he basked in the sun,
â  but as he really breathed, the crowd was
â fled.
R. B. Cornell, the champion rough wa
ter swimmer of the world, made his ap

PREPARING TO ISSUE
GOLD CERTIFICATES
WASHINGTON. Aug. r,.â Treasury offi-
clals have no means of knowing how ]
large the demand will be for gold cer
tificates, the issue of which is to be com
menced to-morrow. It i- expected there
will be a considerable demand for small
denominations, and in order to meet it
the department has made a requisition
on the Bureau of .raving and Printing;
for $10,000,000 li $20 certificates, the small
est nomination that can be issued
under the law.
There were outstanding yesterday cer
tificates of th- former Issue to the
amount of $34,240,519. of which $1,651,520
was in the treasury, leaving in circula- |
tion S^^SX'!'. Practically all of these i
certificates are In the vaults of inks,
for when the "endless chain" was in op
eration, in 1893, bankers hoarded the gold
certificates as heine the safest kind of
paper to carry. The few in general cir
culation quickly disappeared and have
never come out since.
The resumption of the issue of gold cer
tificates will probably bring up in Con
gress the question of the rep- of the
law directing the Secretary of the Treas- tf
urv to issue them. Their use converts the
treasury and sub-treasuries into ware- j
houses for the storing of gold coin for
Its owners, and there has always been
considerable opposition in Congress to
this system. It has a tendency to reduce
the holdings of free gold in the treasury
and make it easier to deplete the gold
reserve In times of "nan uneasiness.
On the other hand, the use of certifi
cates is a great convenience to bankers
and business men. and many of them will
oppose any proposition to repeal the law.

man of Louisville. Ky.. was declared In
sane yesterday on i..c application of his
wife and son. -he family physician tes
tified that Newcombe was auuicted to the
excessive use â :" drugs.
LOUISVILLE. Aug. 6.â Victor New
combe, who was yesterday declared In
sane by a New York court, was once
president of the Louisville and Nashville
Railroad and belongs to one of the most
prominent families of this State. His
father was Horatio D. Newcombe, who
served as president of the Louisville and
Nashville Railroad, and the two did
much to build up that property. Soon
after his father became president of the
corporation young Newcombe was sent
to London, where he was successful in in
teresting English capitalists in the road
and in floating a large issue of bonds.
For this service he was made a director,
afterward becoming vice president, and in
ISSO succeeded to the presidency of the
corporation. Close attention to business
undermined his health, and in 1881 he
moved to New York. After a short pe
riod of retiremen. he organized at 25
Nassau street the United .States National
Bank and was said to have been the
youngest bank president ever elected in
that city. Among his associates in the
enterprise were General U. S. Grant. Mor
ris K. Jessup, William R. Travers and
Henry B. Hyde. For several years he
was prominent in New York financial cir
cles, but in IS9I his health failed. At one
time Mr. Newcombe was very wealthy.

"Grand Chorus." .T. Grls
The panegyric on St. Ignatius was de
livered by Rev. Joseph Sasia. In part he
said:
On this day throughout the length and
breadth of Christendom, in thousands of
temples ... â -.] in hundreds of tongues, the
church extols the grandeur, the virtues and
merits of one of her greatest heroes and
saints. Ignatius of Loyola, the illustrious
founder of the Society of Jesus. And whilst
she honors his memory upon earth by the
imposing solemnity of her liturgy, whilst
she proclaims and sings his glories by the
ravishing strains â â '. sacred music, she points
out to us. at the same time, in the heaven
ly Jerusalem, not a marblf monument that
villi sooner or later ni"i.'.' into dust, but
the everlasting throne, the unfading laurels
and imperishahle crown bestowed upon him
by the Almighty, whoso greater honor and
glory Ignatius constantly taught.
The speaker then entered into 'â¢-. gen
eral outline of the saint's career. It was
a .ketch of his early life, hi** giving up
a life of ease for the service of God, his
courage and of his splendid deeds. He
also sketched the history of the order
which takes Its name from the saint, and
In dwelling on it he said:
The Jesuits have now been before the
world for more than 360 years, and it is
easy for any Impartial, honest, unbiased
mind acquainted with their records to pro
nounce a fair judgment on their past deeds.
Their annals, in almost every language
spoken by men. remind us of the martyred
sons of Ignatius who gave indubitable
proofs of the sincerity of their zeal by the
shedding of their blood: they remind us of
the countless learned works that adorn the
libraries of the civilized world; they remind
us of -he millions of heathens gained to
the fold of Christ: of the multitudes of
heretics restored to the fold: of the numer
ous bands of Christian youths trained, edu
cated, made wiser and holier within the
sacred precincts of their colleges
In the evening solemn vespers were

tron saint of that order. At 11 o'clock
Father Clancy, sub-prior of the monas
tery, with Father McGovern as deacon
and Father Lamb as sub-deacon, came
into the sanctuary and began the mass.
Rhys Thomas, with a double quartet of
professional singers, sang the solemn
high mass. Then followed the grand
hymn to St. Dominic, and after the ser
mon they rendered the "Hallelujah"
chorus with splendid effect.
The most impressive part of the day's
services was the eloquent and profound
sermon of Rev. Father Driscoll. O. P. He
spoke on St. _>ominic, handling his sub
ject with the wisdom of a deep thinker,
the fiery eloquence of an orator and the
zealous "devotion of a Christian. He said,
in part:
In applying the saving merits of his
atonement to the needs of mankind ln
every age, Jesus Christ, creates b" his
grace In the church numerous heroic fol
lowers, who. by the perfect Imitation of
- his "..Vine life reproduce his perfections,
rellect his wisdom, love and power upon
the world, and aid their fellow men to the
attainment of the high fruits and blessed
ness of the redemption. Such are the
saints of God: and such, pre-eminently, was
St. Dominic, the founder of the Order of
Preachers.
. ite gentle spirit of purely monastic life,
and teaching was out of harmony with the
boisterous, nervous and disputatious genius
of the thirteenth century.- Preaching was
* needed: and a preaching at once learned.
Independent and bold: capable of upholding
determinedly the standard of the Gospel
amid the distraction ar.d turmoil of mighty
cities, and of confronting by a genuine faith
and a deeper anil broader science, the nar
row, flippant and almost pagan spirit of the
rising schools. Such was Dominic's design
to meet the urgent needs of Christendom.
The preacher then treated, in a schol
arly manner, the relisrious conditions and
history of the time. He continued:
With hie last breath as if bequeathing
his immortal spirit to his order, Dominic
uttered this solemn admonition: '-Have
charity. guard voluntary poverty, preserve
humility*,' With these words as las last
precious will _i*d testament to his order,
the first and most eloquent of friar preach
ers, the lover and guide of the people, the
light and consolation of the church, the
glory of his ace vid the flower of Christen
dom", calmly and joyfully rendered his no
ble soul into the hands of his Maker.
The founding of a religious order in
Christendom is not by private whim, but
by divine inspiration, and no order '-an
cease to exist until It has fulfilled Its mis
sion. The mission of the order of St.
Dominic is to share the destinies of the
church of Jesus Christ, which abides until
the consummation of time.
At the evening services a special musi
cal programme was rendered. Father
X- v.- Ii preaching on "The Rosary, a Pop
ular Form of Prayer."
Services at St. Patrick's.
Special services were held at St. Pat
rick's last night, on the occasion of the
blessing of statues that have recently
been given to the church. The Choral
Society of the church, under the direction
of Miss Short, gave some delightful se
lections, and Father Heslin preached an
appropriate sermon. The following
donors presented the church with stat
uary: William O'Brien, a statue of St.
Patrick; Mrs. anion, a statue of St.
Brigid: Mrs. Kerr, the Sacred Heart;
Mrs. McElroy, St. Anthony; Mrs. Cather
ine McFarland, the Immaculate Concep
tion.
The fourteen parochial schools of this
city opened last week, with an attend
ance of about 10.000.
Bishop Games Preaches.
Bishop Games of Georgia preached In j
the Third Congregational Church last j
evening. In Introducing him the pastor.
Rev. William Bad referred to the
natural musical and oratorical gifts of
the Southern race and called him the i
Bishop Brooks of the blacks, "who never
apologized for the vices of his people,
nor never failed to condemn mob violence
among the whites."
CHINESE SHOOTING SCRAPE.
Oui Young Kee Mysteriously Shot in
a Dive on Jackson Street.
Oui Young Kee. a highbinder was mys
teriously shot in the Pekin House at 726
Jackson street late Saturday night. As
yet the shooter has not been apprehended, !
but the matter was reported to the Cen- |
tral station and the police hope to make
the capture soon.
Kee was supping with about nine other
Chinaman in a back room in the second
Story of the house when the shooting oc- |
curred. Officers Joy and Marston, who j
were in the neighborhood, heard the shot i
and. hastening to the room, found that |
all the injured man's companions except |
three had fled. An examination disclosed
the fact that Kee had been shot through
the calf of the right leg.
The other Chinamen claim that the
shot was fired accidentally by a drunken
stranger. They refused to talk any fur
ther and are trying to keep the facts
from the police. The injured man refused
to be taken to the hospital and was cared
for by his friends. The officers believe
the affair was the result oj. a highbinders"
row.
Found _)ead in a Cabin.
SAN JOSE. Aug. 6.â Martin Guidax, a
native of Switzerland, aged 55 year., was
found dead to-day in a cabin in the moun
tains above Los Gatos. It is supposed
death occurred about ten days ago from
natural causes.
TO MATCH THE
APACHE AGAINST
THE FILIPINO
Scheme of Old Indian
Fighters.
AN ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND
I ARMY OFFICERS' SUGGESTION TO
THE DEPARTMENT.
The Oregon Troops Will Be Mustered
Out To-Day â Branch Post
office for the General
Hospital.
An attempt is being made to revive a .
! scheme suggested some time ago to the \
War Department, but on which no action ;
has over been taken. It was the advice ;
of the old Indian fighters when the war â 
with the Filipinos broke out that 10,000 j
; Indians be enlisted and sent down there j
to meet the island warriors with their ,
own kind of* fighting. The idea was to
get Apaches, as they are the best foot
fighters of all the Indians of this coun
try, and besides they are at home In all
kinds of country and are used to tropi-
I cal heat
There are over forty thousand Apaches
still in the Southwest, and they are all ;
i ready to fight. They have been under
discipline and understand military ways, |
although they were never much good as .
-. soldiers in the ranks. They are the finest
scouts and trailers in the world, however,
and when they are let alone and allowed
to fight in their own way they make a
formidable enemy. ,
Army officers who have served with the
â¢ Apaches say there would be no trouble
i in getting together an army of 10,000. .
1 They could be commanded by white offi- !
cers, familiar with their habits and able
to control them, and having their own ;
â  sub-chiefs. Th<_jr could stalk the Fili
pinos as well if not better than the Fili
pinos stalk the white troops now waging
war against them, and the Apaches
: would only be too willing to go.
The plan has been more than once
brought to the attention of the War De
! partment. Officers who have served with
the Indians are almost a unit on the ad
visability of the plan, and although the
| task would not be an easy one, almost
' any of them would be willing to go with j
such an organization. It would be the i
hardest kind of work, for the Apache on
| the warpath is tireless and always awake,
j and any officer who goes with them must
' do as they do and bear what they bear.
It is the opinion of army officers that
i such an organization would do more in
1 one season than the entire army now out
1 there could do in three. It is Indian war
| fare, and no one has ever described it a*s |
I anything else. It can only be opposed by
; Indian tactics, and of those the Apaches
I are masters.. They are fierce and cruel.
i but their cruelty can be restrained, and
I there is no doubt about their ability to
! stand the hardships or of their willing
i ness to fight. .
To-day the Oregon regiment will be
j mustered out of service, and to-morrow ,
! they will leave for the north on their spe- j
i cial train. The men will each draw three i
i months' pay besides what is due them on
I their clothing allowances, which will |
j amount to from $.". to $30 per man. j
) An official report upon th.- wounding of -,
; William Holmes of the casual detachment,
; has been made to Captain Hardin, adju- 1
: tant of th.- recruits. The investigation
showed that Holmes and another cook J
i had been arrested by Farrel. the sentry. â¢
i and that after they had been released j
they went down to where Farrel was pa
trolling his beat and watched for a chance
to beat him. Farrel defended himself with
his rifle, and the wounding of Holmes was
, the result. Twice Holmes was reported
dead, but he is still in the general hospital .
and is doing well. ' tf': tftf '-'
Colonel Girard has added another feat
ure to the genera] hospital which will add
much to the comfort and convenience of j
the patients. He applied to the postal au-
t horities for a branch postofflce, and Sat
' urdav Postal Inspector Erwin went out to
i the Presidio and started things going. He
' put H. W. Clum in charge, and already
i mails are being delivered every day. The
I office will be formally opened on the loth
inst when it will be made a regular
money-order office. There will be three
deliveries by carriers every day in each of
the thirty-five wards. The office will be
officially known as Branch 1. Presidio
Postofflce. Colonel Girard is also about j
to establish a bakeshop in the basement
I of one of the wings of the wooden hospital
j on the old parade ground. I
, A dispatch from Chicago says Colonel J. !
B. Sanborn of the First Regiment of the |
Illinois National Guard has invited the i
Tenth Pennsylvania Regiment, on behalf |
of the Chicago regiment of the National
Guard, to stop in Chicago on August 30, it .
being understood the Pennsylvania regi
ment is willing to parade in Chicago after ,
being mustered out at San Francisco. The
Illinois National Guard and the naval
militia propose to arrange a suitable re
: ception for the Pennsylvanians.
A TIE GAME OF CRICKET.
Alameda and Pacific Teams Meet on
the Former's Grounds Without
Reaching a Definite Result.
The Alameda and the Pacific cricket
teams met at the Webster-street grounds,
Alameda, yesterday, and after an inter-
I esting game the play resulted in a draw. '
i The Pacifies were first at the bat and ran
i up a total of 142 runs for three wickets,
when Captain Theobald declared the in
nings closed. J. Meyers scored twenty
! one In good style, while the two not outs,
C. Simmonds and C. P. Coles, played
sterling cricket for fifty-nine and thirty
five, respectively.
Alameda went in with something less
i than two hours In which to make the
runs necessary to win, but the task
I proved impossible of accomplishment.
i Baugh and Hellman started J_ae batting,
the former playing a lucky innings of
twenty-four. in which were many
! chances, the latter contributing seven
teen
J J. R. Peel rattled up thirty-four in
lively fashion and displayed the best
batting form of his side, but the loose
fielding of the Pacifies was accountable
for many runs, and at 109 for five wick
ets down time was called, leaving the
match undecided. The full score follows:

LAURIER WILL NOT
VISIT M'KINLEY
PLATTSBURG. Aug. 6.â President __**-
! Kinley. accompanied by Secretary Cortel
' you. atended church this morning, driving
' up from the Hotel Champlam.
Sir Wilfred Laurier. the Canadian Pre
mier, has reconsidered his determination
to visit the Hotel Champlain while the
i President is here, and therefore will not
' come this week as expected. He believes
that a visit at the present time would
' cause a great deal of unpleasant comment.
Secretary Root will arrive here Tuesday
! morning for a conference with President
I McKinley. Not only the Philippine prob
| lem but also the questions now confront
Â» ing the Secretary of War, such as the sit
' uation in Cuba and Porto Rico and the at
' titude to be maintained toward General
Miles, will be discussed in detail and a
: general plan of action agreed upon. ,
TORAL AND PAREJA
ARE ACQUITTED
MADRID. Aug. 6.â The Supreme Court
martial, before which Generals Toral and
Pareja have been on trial charged with
surrendering Santiago to the American
forces without having exhausted all
means of defense, has acquitted both offi
cers on the ground that they acted upon
the orders of their superiors and only
surrendered when it was impossible to
do otherwise. The judgment severely
censures those in high command in the
colonies and in Spain, as well as the
Government, which is held responsible
for the lack of resources for the defense
of the colonies.
It was rendered by a majority of one
vote only, and is not well received by
the press and public, who wanted a
clearer exposure of the responsibility.
PLANTING YOUNG TROUT.
SAX JOSE. Aug. 6.â Fifty thousand
trout were planted in the streams of this
county to-day under the direction of the
Santa Clara County Fish and Game Pro
tective Association. They were supplied
by the State Fish Commission. Sixty-five
thousand young fish have been appor
tioned to this county, but the club is con
fident of having this number increased to
100.000. Ten thousand had previously been
delivered to the San Jose Water Company
and placed in Howell Lake, above Los
Gatos. â  _ , â¢â â ';, .
The fish received to-day were placed in
Calavaras. Smith. Stevens, Guadalupe
and Los Gatos creeks. They were care
fully distributed, and the association will
take particular pains to see that they are
protected. With its streams so thorough
ly stocked Santa Clara County should
supply excellent fishing in a few years.

TAKEN FOR A
HACK DRIVE
AND HOBOED
Rough Experience of
W. H. Woods.
â â¦ â
CLAIMS HE WAS DRUGGED
â â¢ â
ONE OF HIS ALLEGED DESPOIL
ERS IN JAIL.
Â»
After Being Unconscious for Several
Hours He Awoke and Found
Himself Lying on a
Country Road.
W. H. Woods, a sailor on the training
ship Independence, yesterday complained
to the police that he had been drugged
and robbed by a hackman whom he had
met last Friday night. Woods, according
to his own story, was "taking In the
sights" when he met "Joe" Miller, a hack
driver, who has a stand at Washington
and Kearny streets. Anxious to see a
relative whom he had not met for several
years, Woods instructed the hackdriver
to take him to his home.
Woods remained there only a short time,
and returning to the hack he invited Mil
ler to have a drink with him. They re
paired to a saloon in the vicinity of Sev
enth and Howard streets and had several
drinks at the expense of Woods. Shortly
afterward they were joined by another
hackdriver, who is known to his associ
ates as "Babe." Woods remember^ re
entering the hack, but from that time his
mind is a blank.
When he awakened several hours later
he found he"had been asleep on the road
near the Six-mile House. His purse, con
taining $60, with his watch, was gone.
Woods walked to police headquarters,
where he told his story to Captain Sey
mour. The latter detailed Assistant Hack
Inspector Bowlan on the case, and In a
short time he arrested Miller and charged
him with robbery. At the City Prison he
was positively identified by Woods as his
despoiler.
The identification was amusing, to say
the least. Miller was lined up with four
prison trusties, and Woods was asked if
he could pick out the man who had
drugged and robbed him. After critically
surveying the gang Woods walked over to
Miller and threatened to "break his jaw."
"Let him go for a minute, Sergeant."
he pleaded. "If I don't send him to the
Morgue I'll give you my year's wages."
Fearing that Woods intended to assault
the hackman in the prison, Bowlan or
dered Miller locked up and then escorted
the pugnacious sailor from the scene.
The police are looking for "Babe." the
other hackman. and they are inclined to
believe that he nad a hand in the rob
bery.

& SWEET COMMERCIAL SCNG.
Q SONG too often sung loses its charm, but there
Mis ING often sung loses its charm, gold coin
. g and a suggestion of gold coin
* *in the commercial ditty now being sung
throughout the country which keep it fresh and sweet
to the mercantile mind. To the merchant, farmer,
professional man and wage-earner there is a certain
charm in the reading week after week that business
in the United States is better than ever before, and
that the tide of prosperity that set in soon after the
present Republican administration came into power
shows no signs of ebbing. All conditions indicate
a continued volume of business far in excess of any
thing ever before seen. The weekly bank clearings
still exhibit their unvarying increase over last year,
the heavy gain in railroad earnings shows a free
movement of produce and merchandise, while the
activity in fall orders for iron and steel, boots and
shoes, woolen and cotton goods, lumber and metals,
exceeds the midsummer records of the best previous
year in the history of the country.
Advices from the West and Northwest report a
large and expanding fall trade which in some sections
severely taxes the capacity of the jobbing houses. The
general trend of prices is upward, advances being fre
quent in manufactured goods and the raw product.
Wool continues to rise, and the lumber market is as
firm as ever, with a general and sharp demand for
building purposes. The failures for the week were
156, against 189 for the same week last year, and the
bank clearings show a gain of 34-6 per cent, New Or
leans and Omaha being the only important cities to
record a loss, and that insignificant. No complaints
are heard in any quarter of this vast country, and there
is no weakness apparent except in wheat and its de
pendent cereals, due wholly to the fine crop prospects.
Such is the commercial song now being sung
throughout the land. Dollars set to music make a
sweet and exhilarating lay.
Our financial condition continues as solid as Gibral
tar. The Bank of England, by its recent advance in
the rate of discount, virtually admits that the flow of
gold is into, and not out of, the United States, and
this is emphasized by the shipment of $1,000,000 from
Sydney to San Francisco, and the gradual hardening
of exchange to the gold importing point. There is an
accumulating pile of bills against shipments of Ameri
can produce to Europe, which the latter is being called
upon to pay us in some form or other. In the face of
this fine showing the net purchases of American
stocks by London in Wall street amount to 40,000
shares. These conditions show the United States to
be in an exceptionally strong financial position.
The local situation remains unchanged. Great
activity is reported in provisions, lumber, farming
implements and the large and varied list of staples
regularly exported from San Francisco to all parts of
the world. The fruit season is so profitable that coun
try merchants report the voluntary payment of old
â Recounts previously given up as uncollectable, which
gives the said country merchant a most enjoyable
sensation, a sort of champagne pleasure in doing busi
ness. Ships continue scarce, owing to the heavy ex
port trade, and a number of important articles of pro
duce and manufacture have lately advanced in price.
As for money, there is plenty of it for solvent borrow
ers at moderate rates of interest. Not for years has
San Francisco enjoyed such a lively summer trade
as that of this year, and the fall demand bids fair to
be proportionately heavy. This is a debt-paying year.
According to the veracious Boston Globe an open
air lunch given by Vice President Hobart to General
Alger included hard and' soft shell clams, Spanish
mackerel, cucumbers, lobster, chicken, green corn,
sweet potatoes, cor/i bread, salads, celery, waffles,
watermelon and muskmelon. That may be a normal
New Jersey layout, but if Alger tackled it all we can
understand how he managed to put up with that em
balmed beef without kicking.
A great many of the clergy and some of the laity
have been concerning "themselves lately as to the
whereabouts of the deity in the Philippine war. They
have expressed no whit of anxiety anent the devil,
being well assured that he is still in the "fifing line.
STAND BY THE DOLLAR LIMIT.
v â â >â â â - -â - tftftf'- r-
-
STAND by the dollar limit. That is the final
counsel and exhortation which the people ad
dress to the Supervisors who are expected at
their meeting to-day to fix the estimates and the tax
levy for the ensuing year. The path of duty is, there
fore, plain. The Supervisors have but to keep their
pledges and all will be well.
Doubtless a good deal of pressure will be brought
I to bear upon the Republican majority of the board to
j induce them to break the pledge. Many persons who
! clamored for the dollar limit when it was a campaign
I cry will be among those who now seek to have a
[ higher tax levy and a larger revenue than can be ob
1 tamed within that limit. The advice and the urgings
of such persons should be set aside. They would have
been among the first to denounce the Supervisors for
'â¢- breaking the pledge had it been broken.
The Republicans of the board must stand firm. They
! must not permit Democratic demagogues to make
! cheap politics out of an issue of this kind. The board
j is under Republican control, the dollar limit is a Re
| publican pledge, it has been recommended by Repub
licans and is indorsed and supported by Republicans. :
; Democrats in office may break their pledges to the |
j people, but the Republican party has a record for
fidelity and insists that its representatives in office !
shall keep the record clean and unstained.
The dollar limit policy must be tested. The taxpay
i ers have desired it for years and they have a right to
demand of the Supervisors that it be given a fair
trial.
It is of course the duty of the Supervisors to go
carefully over the various estimates that have been |
j 'submitted and apportion the revenues fairly accord- I
I ing to the relative needs of the various departments j
'of the city and county government. The moment
that has been done the estimates should be adopted
and the tax levy fixed. There should be no dilatory ;
tactics, no delay, no postponements for the sake of
temporizing or for compromising with the advocates j
of a higher levy.
The whole question has been gone over time and
again. It is as well understood now as it can ever be
until a practical test has been made. The voters, the
taxpayers, the property owners of the city look to the
Republican Supervisors to put the test into opera
tion. There is no way by which the issue can be hon
orably avoided or evaded. The dollar limit is de
manded. Republicans must fulfill their pledges and
prove their fidelity to the people who trusted them
with power and office. The Call, which supported the
Republican Supervisors in the last campaign, has con
fidence they will keep their pledges, and be faithful to
their trust.
TO SAVE Sf-IN FRANCISCO.
WITH the coming of to-morrow the contest at
the primaries will begin, and it is hardly too
much to say that with the close of that con
test it will be virtually known whether San Francisco
is to have an honest, business-like administration to
succeed the present one, or whether the government
of the city under the new charter is to be put into
operation by bosses for the benefit of taxeaters and
boodlers.
It is not worth while to make any extended review
of the comparative iniquities of the two factions
struggling for supremacy in the Democratic camp.
The Examiner has with much reiteration told the
people a good deal about Buckley, and Buckley has
I told a good deal about the Examiner. For years the
rivals of to-day were partners and members of the
same gang.'
While these rival bosses with their gangs are left
to fight out their battle by themselves, the taxpayers,
the property owners, the better citizens will turn to
the Republican primaries to consider what is going on
there. That there are certain disreputable bosses
seeking to obtain control of the Republican conven
tion is not to be denied. It has been noted, how
ever, that at every step taken in arranging for the
party primaries those bosses have been baffled and
beaten. As the matter stands now the men who repre
sent true Republicanism and have an intelligent re
gard for the welfare of the city have a chance to elect
honest delegates to the convention and thus make
certain the nomination of p. clean and strong and win
ning ticket for the campaign.
Honest men cannot be elected without the votes oi
honest men. The ward bosses and the spoilsmen are
not going to work for men who would repudiate them
in the convention. They will send there, if they can,
serviceable creatures of their own, and will require
them to nominate a ticket equally subservient. There
will then be but little choice between rival candidates
in the campaign, and it will be too late for good citi
zens to redeem the municipality.
The issue is not to be set aside, and he is but a
fool who thinks he can shirk his political duty with
impunity. The Examiner of yesterday set forth the
evils of boss domination. It said of Buckley that
when he was in power "he dealt in the corruption
of public officers as other men deal in groceries. He
sold franchises over scores of miles of the city streets.
He sold judgments from the bench. He sold acquit
tals to criminals who could afford to pay. He fixed
th. membership of Grand Juries and decided who
should and who should not be indicted. He had men
sent to State's prison, and when this would not serve
he has had men assassinated."
The boss who did all that was the partner, the aider,
the counselor of the Examiner while doing it, and the
Examiner was his partner. Can any decent citizen
confront the possibility of having either a Buckley or
an Examiner-Rainey administration in power. Yet
one or the other may win if the Republicans put up a
weak or a bad ticket. The issue then is plain. Good
citizens must attend the Republican primaries to-mor
row and vote for honorable men as delegates to the
convention. That is the only way to sav_ San Fran-
I cisco arid her taxpayers from the abominations of
j boss rule.
By rising at .** o'clock in the morning and making
a hurried journey of sixty miles, the Governor or
Georgia succeeded in saving a negro from a gang of
lynchers. It was a commendable act, and yet it is
by no means creditable to Georgia that her Chief
Executive has to lose his sleep in work of that kind.
THE REPUBLICANS OF IOWf-I.
AS there have been many evidences of late that
certain time-serving Republicans are seeking
to postpone a settlement of the money prob
lems of the country until after the next election, it is
gratifying to note that the convention representing
the Republicans of lowa has not only declared an un
shaken allegiance to the sound-money policy of the
party, but has urged the importance of embodying
that policy in law.
The plank referring to the subject in the platform
is sufficiently strong to be worth quoting. It says:
"We readopt the following declaration from the
lowa Republican platform of 1898:
" 'The monetary standard of this country and the
commercial world is gold. The permanence of this
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, . AUGUST 7, 1899.
standard must be assured by Congressional legisla
tion, giving to it the validity and vitality of public
law. All other money must be kept at a parity with
gold.'
"And we urgently call upon our Senators and Rep
resentatives in Congress to lend their best endeavors
to enact these propositions into law."
Declarations such as these coming from a body
representing the sterling Republicanism of lowa will
go far toward offsetting the weak counsels of .--men
who, while claiming to be supporters of sound money,
are yet insisting that nothing should be done at. this
time to put our monetary system upon a sound.basis.
The Republicans of lowa declare against a timid and
compromising course. They are for settling the con
troversy at once. They have solicited the suffrages
of the people on certain propositions and, having been
successful, they now demand that their Representa
tives in Congress shall use every effort to enact those
propositions into law. 'â¢" ,â  ; . '.*
In the position they have taken, the Republicans of
lowa do not stand alone. The intelligence of the non-
tion is with them. All the great business interests of
the country are on their side. Merchants, manu
facturers, bankers, farmers alb classes of men who
have a fair knowledge of the financial problems of the
lepublic join them in the.demand for legislation. Our
monetary system has been too- long the football of
political struggles. It is time to take it out of politics
and establish it upon a basis that will make industry
secure and commerce safe.
lowa is so solidly Republican that but little interest .
will be taken by outsiders in the contest that.is to
come. The State issues involved concern only' the
people of the State. The one point of, national inter
est is this manly declaration in favor of a straightfor
ward policy on the part of Congress in dealing with
the money question. It is a declaration that comes,
at the right time and is expressed in the right word **. '
It gives cheer to those who have been battling for
currency reform and carries confusion to the time
servers and the compromisers.
the McNaughton case.
WHEN, according to an old story, certain jury
men are asked to explain why, despite the
strong evidence against him, they had ac
quitted a prisoner charged with hog stealing, they re
plied frankly, "We had some of the pork." The story
is an illustration of the truth that acquittals are' easy
where juries are biased in favor of the accused.
Although that fact is well known we find many peo
ple sufficiently credulous to accept the acquittal of a
person by even the most-partial jury as a conclusive
proof of his innocence. The Marysville Democrat
exhibits that sort of credulity in its comments on the
results of the investigation of the charges brought
against McNaughton, the newly elected principal of
the State Normal School of San Jose.
McNaughton, a man wholly unknown to California,
was chosen principal of the Normal School by Trus
tees appointed by Governor Gage for political pur
poses. When charges were made against McNaugh
ton, based upon evidence obtained in localities where
he was known, the Trustees who elected him acted as
a jury to try him. He may be innocent, but innocent
or guilty his acquittal by such a jury was politically
necessary and a matter of course. Yet upon that
record our Marysville contemporary says:
"Some time ago the San Francisco Call contained
an attack upon Governor Gage, in which the Execu
tive was held responsible for the appointment of a bad
man named McNaughton as president of the San
Jose Normal School. It declared that a large major
ity of the appointments made by the Governor are
bad, and that McNaughton is the worst of the whole
job lot. We suggested at the time The Call may have
been misinformed and that the man certainly is enti
tled to a trial before conviction. A press telegram
sent from San Jose yesterday announced that, after
a thorough investigation of all the charges the Nor
mal School Trustees had unanimously decided that
Professor McNaughton is not guilty of wrongdoing."
In that statement there are some inaccuracies. The
Call has, indeed, said a majority of Gage's appoint
ments are bad; but it has been far, far from saying
that "McNaughton is the worst of the whole job lot."
Gage has appointed some good men, but in his going
up and down the State picking up stray sheep for his
mutton he has picked up many a blacker one than
McNaughton even should all the charges made against
that person be true.
The Call has never pronounced judgment upon the
McNaughton case. We published his record as it was
made known to us by reports from places where he
lived. The point made by The Call was and is that
Gage in seeking to turn the State Normal School
into a part of the spoils of politics appointed as Trus
tees of the institution men who, in subservience to
bosses and for political reasons, set aside the claims
of all the eminent and honorable educators of Cali
fornia and elected to the principalship a man who
was then wholly unknown* to 'the State, but who is
now known to have been living for years under the
cloud of serious charges made by responsible men in
a formal and official way; charges which he evaded
by leaving the place where they were made.
We repeat that the disgrace thus brought upon the
Normal School is a part of Gage's work just as much
as is the disgrace brought upon the Board of Health
in this city; and he must be held responsible, for the
one as for the other.
Fast being driven out of trade by the oncoming au
tomobile, it was thought that the poor horse might
still have continued as a pet of society. As far as
that hope is concerned in these parts it is blasted.
Prince Poniatowski drove four mules to a swell drag
the other day at B'lingum and they made such a hit
with the local Four Hundred that it is believed the
hybrid will become the proper thing to the utter ex
clusion of the equine.
It is the patriotic duty of every citizen to contribute
in proportion to his means to the fund required for
the reception of the California Volunteers. Let your
money talk liberally now and you can shout better
when the boys come home.
The welfare of San Francisco depends upon the suc
cess of a clean ticket at the Republican primaries to
morrow. Make up your mind to-day that you will
go to the polling booths and vote right.
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford, judging from his
apathy in the Wclls-Fargo war revenue stamp case,
is endeavoring to live up to the feeling suggested by
his baptismal name.
Â» â
Contribute now to the volunteers' reception fund,
and when the boys come home you will have a right
to cheer.

INTERESTING PHASES
OF THE BIG OIL BOOM
i ; The oil boom spreads, and intensifies
, dally.'- San 'Francisco men' ttiid San Fran

I tions in. the Fresno County oil fields near
i Coalinga, and southward, and San Joaquin
Valley companies still multiply" to operate
; all through the oil region .which stretches

| ,of the eastern slope of the Coast Range
I and in districts' in the Kern t County foot-
I hills of the Sierra Xova.as.- 'A number of .
j prominent San .Francisco capitalists and
business^ *__ef& are interested in big com
panies newly formed to explpit properties,

formed in the city is the proposed Oil Ex
change, of which Wendell Easton is the
head; and , which is designed to. practi
cally, control; the State's output of oil. In
cluding Southern California as well as thÂ«
Coolinga field. _____ "-â¢'â¢:;
: It may, be said that the new oil situa
tion has two main general features. One
is the 'legitimate development of the un
doubtedly great oil resources of the State
north of>Tebachapi; and the other is the
natural and .undoubtedly great aggrega
tion of wildcat operations and downright
swindling schemes that are and will con
tine to be floated for the benefit of un
scrupulous-promoters and the catching of
suckers who are not well posted on the
ways and wrinkles of the oil business,
i The!. Coalinga field' has quickly become
the banner producing district of the State.
It is the first ..producing field of any im
portance developed north of Southern
California, : and It *is â¢ the' : first actual
demonstration' that there are great com
mercial possibilities in the oil yielding
formations that continuously attend the
Coast Range throughout the length of the
State.' After thirty-five years of fruitless
prospecting from Tehachapi to. : Del Norte
a .rich field .has at last been developed,
and it warrants the long-standing faith of
I experts that -such fields would be discov-
I ered in time in this stretch of folded, un
j altered sandstones and shales. * -.y'
The Coalinga oil appears to be the best
fuel oil yet found in the State. It is dit
- ferent from any of the Southern Califor
nia oils in being lighter, less of the vola
' tile elements having escaped. To the ex
! tent of the supply it has driven the
Southern California oil ,out of the San
Francisco market, and the producers ob
! tain a higher price. Large San Francisco
i consumers pay about $1 30 per barrel, and
| the producers are said to net over $1 a
! barrel at the wells, while .Los Angeles
| producers get 85 cents. The entire present
production is from the small area at Oil
City controlled by Messrs. Canfield A-.
Chanslor and their associates, who are
securing extensive additional areas to
prospect. With the exception of the
Krevenhagen field, about twenty miles
south of Oil City, where a small yield has
already been secured, all other operations
are vet but prospeclng ones and carry
possibilities merely. But there is every
reason to expect the development of other
producing fields of importance. A great
amount of good money will be sunk In
prospecting, and a success here and
there will probably add largely to- the
oil supply and to the wealth of the lucky
ones.
But the fakes are legion. Few could
he easily pointed out, but it is well known
that scores of stock companies are being
floated on the basis of any conveniently
distant patch of desert and on the tine
of th.- popular oil craze. This basis does
well enough in one way, as the shares are
mainly bought in a purely gambling
spirit," not at all to draw dividends from
future sales of oil, but to sell at an ad-
Other companies are successfully formed
to operate in good faith and the operators
are simply and foolishly going it blind.
The land secured in within a few miles
of a producing or a promising territory
and there Is likely an oil seepage on in
land, as there is in thousands of places
where ten barrels of oil could not be se
cured. But wells will be put down where
an expert could tell that there was no
chance of success; Many San Francisco
people, as well as thousands of people
elsewhere, are venturing money in these
two classes of operations. The wrecks,
of disastrous oil operations will strew the
San Joaquin Valley, while here and there
a notable success may be attained.
The Fresno Republican has awakened
amid the fever to call a halt In the reck
less oil speculation. With all confidence m
the value and future of Fresno County s
oil fields, it says: * .
"But gambling in oil stocks /is a verj*
dlfferent thing, and it is with stock
gambling rather than with oil develop
ment that the present boom, outside
of Fresno, is chiefly concerned. Wild
cat companies are being formed by
men of no responsibility and no resources
beyond a doubtful title to a stretch of
doubtful land which they have no means
nor Intention of developing. The stock
of these companies is being put on the
market, not as an Investment, but as a
gambling risk. People buy it. not to keep
it but to sell it again at inflated prices,
each holder hoping to pass it on to an
other, until the last man is left to "hold
the bag" and the whole thing collapses.
Such manias of speculation do not help
hut only hinder legitimate development,
and in the long run they bring an odium
which nothing can counteract.
Amid the present "wlldcatting" in the
new oil territory a portion of a paper In
the current Mining and Scientific Press I.
XV. 1.. Watts is of especial Interest. .Mr.
Watts has spent years In special studies
of the California oil regions for the State
Mining Bureau. Regarding "The Busi
ness Risks of the Oil Prospector he says:
"The business risk of prospecting for oil
varies greatly. Oil prospecting proposi
tions may be divided Into two orders:
"First "the 'orthodox' proposition. In
this case the prospectors have in view ; a
definite oil-yielding stratum, which has
proved remunerative in adjacent terri
tory, and from which stratum they expect
to obtain their oil. Moreover,' they have
sufficient geological evidence in sight . to
warrant the assumption that the Oil
stratum they have in view forms an oil
line through the territory they are about
to prospect. ._. ~ _
"Second the 'wildcat' propositions. In
this instance the prospectors have no
definite oil stratum in view which has
proved remunerative In adjacent territory,
or they have not sufficient geological evi
dence in sight to warrant the assumption
that an oil-yielding stratum, which 13
known to be productive in adjacent ter
ritory, forms an oil line through the land
they are about to prospect. â¢* . ;
"In prospect wells of the first order the
least' risk is taken where the outcrop of
an oil sand, which has proved remunera
tive in a certain oil field, can be actually
traced through the territory to be pros
pected, and the geological structure of the
locality is known. - â¢ -, _ â â¢_ ',* -
"More risk,. 1 however, is - undertaken
where there isfpo outcrop of the oil sand,
although the strike and dip of a remuner
ative body of oil sand in an adjacent 'oil
field are known, and the rocks overlying
the oil sand can be traced to the territory
about to be prospected. â  - -
"Most oil-mining enterprises which have
for their object the development of new
territory, especially when operations are
conducted at a distance from any known
oil fields, are 'wildcat' propositions. Some
idea of the conditions regulating the
amount of risk Involved in such enter
prises may be gathered from the follow
ing statements:
"The least risky wildcat proposition is
the case in which the strike and dip of a
remunerative stratum of oil sand in an oil
field adjacent to the territory about to be
prospected has been ascertained; and al
though there Is no further geological evi
dence In sight it is found after carefully
platting a map of the territory that if the
stratum of oil sand were extended in the'
direction of its strike, without any mate
rial alteration of the angle of the dip,
It would form an oil line across the terri
tory to be prospected. It is a. more risky
wildcat proposition to prospect the side
of the fold opposite to that. on which an
oil line has been developed, In cases where
surface indications warrant the assump
tion that the same sequence of formation
exists on both sides of the fold and yet
no outcrop of oil sand has been discovered
on the side about to ne prospected. * -- '
"It is a stul more risky wildcat propo
sition when a stratum of oil san . has been
discovered concerning which nothing Is
known except that the sand gives evi
dence of containing oil and a well is sunk
for the first time to determine- whether or
not the oil sand contains oil in remuner
ative quantities. -â  /; - V.."_-
"It is a much more risky wildcat prop
osition where no outcrop of oil sand has
been discovered, but where a well is sunk
in a certain formation because it shows
some irregular seepages of petroleum, or
because the formation appears to be simi
lar to that containing a remunerative
body of oil sand In other places.
"It is well for oo prospectors to study the
risk they are about to take before ex
pending money, and care should be taken
to control sufficient territory, that they
may have sufficient room to develop their
oilfield in case their venture proves suc
cessful. No one should undertake the
more risky forms of prosnecting unless he
can well' afford to lose the money to be
pin into the enterprise." â  ,
This expert, -of course, deals here
mainly with the second cla-- of operations
mentioned above. Ordinary horse sense
is all that, is needed as a guide when those
of the first' class- -approach.
The oil situation at Santa Barbara is
interesting. â¢-' The comparatively recent
and remarkable â 'development of an exten
sion of the Summerland* field under the
ocean with pipes- sunk. -through* the briny
deep into the oil-yielding. strata that pitch
at an Incline, out under the -.-.sea has
prompted'enterprislng oil men to prospect
the shore in front of some of Santa Bar
bara's most exclusive suburbs. â¢ The
beach between the' lines of high and low
tide are not private property, and on a
section of this ' tide, land right in front
of .Mrs. C. H. Fernald's beautiful home
at Miramar Messrs'. French - and Cody
raised an unsightly 'derrick and planned
others. Mrs. Fernald objected and' nearly
all Santa Barbara objected' to- the pros
pect of a lot of great unsightly derricks
marring the beauty of their famed ..and
gentle beach and troubling "the" Arcadian
quiet of that dreamy retreat.
In the night a lot of "prominent- citi
zens" razed the derrick and carted away
the last inch of rope, and , iron, .further
vigilance committee operations, it is
threatened, will follow -further attempts
to tap those warm and shelving sands.
The oil operators threaten to buy snot
guns and go right ahead. All Santa
Barbara prefers beauty to < oil, and there
is more trouble coming. 'â  Santa Barbara
has demonstrated that' it.-.is aesthetic.
The Santa Barbara. Press champions the
beach defenders, and says:
"It is worth, everything to Santa Bar
bara and the ..suburban resident districts
that the sea front shall be held inviolate
from the disfigurement of derricks or
other unsightly buildings. The develop
ment of oil*- near the city is of but small
value, and at best it is a question whether
oil exists in paying quantity In any of
the numerous locations that infringe on
the city limits. Santa Barbara Is not and
can not be made a commercial city, out
must, if it is to exist at all, remain as It
Is, the most delightful residence place on
the American Continent."
The Santa Barbara issue is important
and Interesting from a legal standpoint
as well. The beach between the lines of
high and low tide is the property of the
State. From the line of low tide to the
three-mile limit the ocean floor is under
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Lnited
States. The Federal mining laws govern
ing mineral locations cannot apply to
these tide lands. Whether and how they
might apply beyond the line of low tide
should somebody want to file a claim on
the waves is a new and unsolved problem.
But he State has never In any way pro
vided for mineral locations or for the
mining use of Its tide lands. At Summer
land and elsewhere a form of locating on
them has been gone through with by oil
operators, but the "11 men are undoubt
edly squatters, holding possession by the
suffrance of the State. Their legal eject
ment would be accomplished by a suit
filed by the Attorney General. The Santa
Barbara legal war may definitely bring
this issue Into court, and if so interesting
legal problems will be raised.
The Santa Fo is the largest burner of
fuel oil in the State, and one of the larg
est producers upon its own account, says
the Riverside Enterprise. The company
is now using nearly 1000 barrels of oil
daily. The company has in the neighbor
hood of sixty engines fitted with mechan
ical appliances which makes oil burning
possible, and the number is to be In
creased as fast as the necessary arrange
ments for the purpose can be made. The
oil is cheaper than coal, much cleaner
and easier to handle, and in every way
preferable. The company now produces
something like 400" barrels of oil a day
from its own fields, and new wells are
i . ing constantly drilled. The stuff is also
being used for saturation of the roadbed
at several points, for the purpose of lay
ing the dust of the desert, which In times
past has made traveling at certain sea
sons in some places anything but' pleas

Southern California's latest is a mica
excitement at San Jacinto. Deposits of
mica described as "immense" have been
found in hills near that town and a Los
Angeles assayer has said that It is the
finest mica vet found in this country. The
town of San Jacinto rushed to the said
hills, which are staked out in every di
rection in the way usual to "rushes."
Most: San Jacinto business men own
shares in mica mines now. The San
Jacinto Register says: "The road has
been kept hot to the mines for a number
of days," and adds the strange informa
tion: ''Machinery has been ordered for
the manufacture of oil from mica.'" It is
to be hoped the discovery is a valuable
one, but tew such discoveries are val
uable. As with Slate deposits the quali
ties of texture, color and cleavage, af
fording large and regular : sheets and
giving commercial value, are exceptional.
Definite information about the find is not

CROLL'S SENSATIONAL CATCH
CLOSE CONTEST IN OAKLAND IN
THE MORNING.
Harper Pitches a Great Game at
Recreation Park in tne After
noon and Moskiman Falters
Through. Overwork.
AFTERNOON GAME.
"Watsonville 5, Oakland 1.
The Watsonville ball tossers, with Har
per ln the box, won the afternoon game
at Recreation Park with a fair margin of
runs. Thirteen times was Moskiman
found for safe hits, but as he pitched the
morning game at Oakland the defeat is
not of the disparaging order. The price of
hayseeds, pretty much on the decline Sat
urday afternoon and yesterday morning,
took a sudden Jump in the afternoon, for
the Dudes soiled their fine vestments in
attempting to ride rough-shod over the
Farmers.
The very first Inning gave the Farmers
a line on the score board. Brockhoft went
to the first bag on an honest hit, and his
accommodating friend, "Tui" McCarthy,
swatted the ball for a double, whereby
"Brock" coursed the bags and calne to
port.
At the beginning of the third some one
in the grand stand presented Lange with
a. stick fancifully ornamented with rib
bons. The king of the Dudes thought that
it was very proper to try' out the gift
horse without a look in its mouth. He
was ln error, for he soon died by the
hand that fed hl.i. This very same in
ning McCarthy cantered home for the
Farmers, and the score board read 2-0
and was decorated with wheat.
In the fifth inning Harper scored. His
first pedestal was reached by a hit. He
went to second on a chance, and a two
bagger by accommodating "Tui" Mc-
Carthy sent him flying across the plate.
The sixth was the banner inning for Wat
sonville. After two men lay under some
finely Inscribed tombstones Hayes went
to first on an error of Moskiman, and
then Harper swung his stick at a ball
that twisted Schmeer's hands out of
shape. Harper was safe. Brockhoff
came to the plate and whizzed out a
three-bagger, sending Hayes and Harper
around the bags at a lightning pace. After
tins feast of fireworks nothing effecttive
was accomplished by the Farmers.
The seventh opened propitiously for the
Dudes, but ended tragically. Donovan
gained the first resting place on an error
of Brockhoff and went to second on a hit
by Peeples. Hammond fanned thrice and
"Lefty" Huthinson went cantering to first
on balls. The bags were filled when Har
dle tried to steer the ship. He was good
for a single, allowing Donovan a chance
to score. Dunleavy flew to Croll and
Lange followed by a hit to Croll far out
of his territory. Croll caught the ball
after a hard run and jump high in the
air. He stuck out his left and pulled the
ball in. It was a sensational catch and
received the full- meed of applause.
The score is:

MORNING GAME.
Oakland 5, Watsonville _.
One very bad inning wrecked the Farm
ers yesterday morning on the Freeman
baseball grounds. The Dudes took Whalen
â unto themselves and they did him. Five
hits and as many runs were indited on
the ore book and the Hayseeds felt as
if a thrashing machine had pased over
â¢them before the Oaklanders were sent to
* Â« field. _ : _"- â '. Â« *
Neither side had scored during the first
three innings and both teams were play
ing good ball. Then Mr. Whalen of the
orange shirt was discovered and his rec
ord was put in jeopardy. Hardie was the
first man up and he made the first bag on
an error by McCarthy, getting free trans
portation to second when Lange smote the
ball to center. A little juggling in the
middle field and Hardie scored, Dunleavy
moving to third and Lange freezing fast
to the second station. Schmeer and
Donovan followed in rapid succession
with hits and Dunleavy and Lange added
two runs to the Dudes' column. Moski
man was retired, but Peeples hacr better
luck, rapping the spheroid out to right
field, which gave Schmeer an opportunity
to tally. A hit by Hutchinson to right
gave Donovan a run, and Peeples, who
was ambitious to score, died at home.
This retired the Dudes, but they were
satisfied. McCarthy went into the box
the following inning and pitched good
ball. Not another run was made off him
by the Oaklanders during the rest of the
game. â¢
In the fifth inning Morrow crossed the
plate for the Farmers, but the eighth and
ninth were the exciting epochs of the
game. Billings went to first on a hit
ln the eighth and Whelan, who was tlie
target of the small boys' Jokes, pulled
himself together and drove the ball over
the left field fence for a homer. The
Farmers died quickly after that strain.
The next inning gave them another run
and for a time it looked as if the score
would be tied. Croll went walking to first
and the Indian drove a far one to right
for two bags, Croll scoring. Donovan fol
lowed with a single and the Indian, at
tempting to score on it, was caught on
the plate All that followed was meat
and drink for the Dudes but poison for
the Farmers.
The score is:

CORNWALL IS DEAD, HIS
VICTIM IS RECOVERING
POLICEMAN H. G- WHITE.
THE murderous episode of Saturday at the California-street Police Station
is about closed. The chief actor in the tragedy, is dead at the City and
County Hospital, while his would-be victim is in a fair way to recover.
Officer H. G. White was resting easily at. his home, 3325 Twenty-first street,
last night, although the wound on his breast has given him considerable
' trouble. The bullet, which halted so opportunely in its course to his heart,
broke the surface of the skin, making a slight abrasion. His breast is black

violent blow. ; -,_i- .''."â  â¢ â¢ .
George D. Cornwall's mother arrived' from Stockton yesterday afternoon and
went immediately to the bedside of her erring son at the City and County Hos
pital. She sat with him for several hours, trying to console the wretched being
in his dying moments. At first she was anxious to have an operation performed
in the hope of saving his worthless life, but after consulting with Dr. Maher she
decided to leave the case in his hands.
By the merest accident Property Clerk Moran was not the victim of Corn
wall's murderous revolver Saturday instead of Officer White. Cornwall had
.secured an order from Corporal Burke of the California-street Police Station
Saturday morning for the return of the articles found on him at the time of
his arrest earlier in the day. Equipped with this document he called on the
property clerk between 11 and 12 o'clock. He evidently was in* an ugly mood,
and refused to give his address. Detective Balnbrldge came in and told Captain
Moran to put Cornwall's address as Lodl. This was done and Cornwall was
given his effects. As he was leaving he turned to Moran and said in a threat

games of their double-header with Louisville
and St. Louis to-day. The team has now won

CHICAGO, Aug. Câ The Orphans and the

work virtually presented Cleveland with the
first game, his wildness being followed by a
bunching of hits. Garvin had the Wanderers
at his mercy .in the second until the game
looked safe, then let down and was found
freely at the finish. Donohue's batting was

KID M'COY WINS
THE OPEN STAKE
AT UNION PARK
Great Course With
Wait a Little.
THE "KID" A SHORTENDER
RUNS WITH GREAT GAMENESS
AND SPEED AT ALL TIMES.
Coursing at Ingleside Park Also At
tracts a Large Attendance of
the Leashmen and Their
Followers.
E. M. Kellogg's Eastern-bred grey
hound Kid McCoy placed the first stake
to the credit of his owner at Union
Coursing Park yesterday. The brindle
dog was a shortender throughout the
day with the exception of his first time
out. when he met Statesman. In the other
rounds he defeated Firm Friend, Craw
ford Lad, Twin City Girl, For Glory, and
for the stake Wait a Little, a 2 to 1
favorite.
A strong hare is always picked for the
final, and in this Instance excellent judg
ment was used. Walt a Little led from
the slips by four lengths and worked the
hare for a number of turns and wrenches.
The hare reached the escape, but instead
of passing through turned back toward
the point from which it had been liber
ated. To the great joy of the short
enders the Kid took possession and
worked the hare across the by, getting
some ten lengths away from the other
dog. The hare accomplished a complete
circuit of the fleld and this time made
good his escape.
The sport throughout the day was ex
cellent, the do X*K * being evenly matched
In the majority of the courses. The bet
tors thought they had a grievance with
Slipper Wren for a time, In the Bonita-
Maori Land course there was a bungle
before the dogs were released. In the
subsequent struggles Bonita escaped
from" the slips. Happily she was unsight
ed, and was caught before she injured
any chances she might have had. The

TAKES BRAINS
TO PREPARE A
FAIR TAX LEVY

Plain Politics.

DO NOT DEFEND.

Elected.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Aug. 6.
On Monday evening the city government }
will take the initial step toward deciding j
whether Oakland shall progress or recede j
during the current fiscal year.
The fixing of the tax levy will be the :
business of the evening after receiving the ;
estimates of Auditor Breed and the ac- j
companying message of Mayor Snow. It !
is true that so far as the amount of the i
tax levy is concerned, the matter is sup- i
posed to have been fixed at the party con- j
ventions held ln the spring. All will |
recollect how Mayor Davie made his cam- j
paign with much pardonable pride on his
record as Mayor of the city on a dollar
tax levy. To offset his' thunder his Op
ponents", including Mayor Snow, also de- j
clared that they would not approve of j
any higher tax lew than one dollar, and [
such was the slogan of all campaigns.
Much of the talk about a dollar tax
lew, so far as Oakland is concerned, is
buncombe. It is distressing and does not
appear to any Intelligent citizen. A grow
ing city. like a growing business, cannot
keep pace with competitors unless it prac
tices some liberality in its affairs. A dol- â¢
lar tax Injudiciously spent is altogether too
much. A half-dollar tax wasted is also
too much. A levy of two dollars, if spent
judiciously and In such a manner that
the citizens derive permanent benefit from
it, is not too high. The nonsense about
a dollar tax levy is simply as dust thrown
in the public eve. What taxpayers de
mand is a return for every dollar of taxes |
collected, and so long as they are assured
<â¢!" this they do not care at what figure
the tax levy is placed In reason.
After all, the tax levy is only a delu
sion. It is really the assessment that
controls the levy. It is a very easy mat
ter to fool with figures, and they can be
made to lie more than a yellow romancer.
Oakland is really under the thumb of the
County Assessor in the matt* of her tax
levy. The charter provides that the fig
ures of the County Assessor shall be the
basis of the city's assessment. In a po
litical year. which is generally the year
before an election, a County Assessor can
become very popular by reducing the
assessment _: per cent. This, of course.
would necessitate an Increase of 25 per
rent in the tax levy to produce the same
income as that of the previous year. The
City Council would have to bear all the
odium of fixing a higher tax levy, whereas
their hands were completely tied before
they undertook the task. It is easy for a
County Assessor to swell the assessment
roll by putting on it a million or so of
railroad property which it is known will
be stricken from the county roll by the
State Board of Equalization. There is
now about a million and a half of railroad
property on the city rolls which will fig
ure In the making of the tax levy, but
which should be discarded by the Council
because it is known that the tax upon it
will never lie lid. On a dollar levy this
quantity would make a difference of $15,
--00 to build many miles of good
streets.
The City Council must tnk-- cognizance
of these facts in fixing the levy or there
will be the me lamentable poverty to
be encountered at the end of the fiscal
year as was experienced by the city three
months ago. This is the first year in
which it has been the duty of the Council
to arrange in the estimates for the large
annexed district, as last year the legality
of the annexation was still in the courts.
This district should receive a larger share
than its proportion of the taxes to make
tip for what it has lost during two years
of doubt in which it paid its taxes into the
city treasury, receiving little but promises
in return. A glance at East Twelfth
street, which was permanently Improved
a year ago by a direct taxation of a few
cents, should be considered in fixing the
new levy, and an appropriation should be
included for at least one such public im
provement, Naturally, in view of the
new civic conditions, the thoroughfare to
he next Improved should be San Pablo
avenue, which runs directly through the
annexed territory, and upon which a first
class electric road has just been com
pleted.
Usually the fixing of the tax levy is re
garded by ' a;... .is as a perfunctory duty,
to bo got rid of as soon as possible;
but this idea Is positively wrong and
really criminal. It is the most important
duty Imposed on a City Council, and re
quires much thought and careful judg
ment. There are In the Council enough
business men to direct the financial af
fairs of the city in such manner as will
give perfect satisfaction, but if petty pol
itics, personal ambitions and sectional
strife be allowed to dominate the deliber
ations this year will be one of failure.
The Oakland of to-day is not the Oak
lard of five years ago. It is a lamentable
fact that many of the men charged with
the government of the city are not suffi
ciently informed of its needs. A few days
ago I asked some of the Councilmen how
often they had walked along the water
front during the past five years, and to
my surprise not one of those I spoke to
had performed this duty. Yet on the
water front are improvements rapidly be
ing developed, and in the harbor lies the
secret of the city's future. Every wharfâ
and there are too few of themâ kept
busy to its utmost capacity, and often
several ships are waiting for berths. Dur
ing this week some interest was created
by the â¢ publication of the fact that the
corrugated iron for the roofing of the im
mense granaries being constructed at the
foot of Myrtle street had to be shipped
from Pennsylvania, when there is every
facility for manufacturing it. in this city,
and also a coast ide that would justify
the establishment of such a plant. These
are some of the ideas that should enter
into the deliberations of the City Council
and should be the guide of their actions.
If a tax levy higher than $1 is neces
sary to foster Improvements, to encourage
the establishment of factories and to
build up the commerce of this city, then
a Citj Council can depend upon the sup
port of the taxpayers In fixing such a
levy. The duty of municipal government
does not consist entirely in maintaining
the city's present Status but in hiving the
foundation each year for future develop
ments and progress to the end that the
assessment roll can be honestly increased
each year, which should mean an ulti
mate * reduction of each successive tax
levy. Judged by this standard, the last
five ears of government in this city can
not be called a great success.
The reference made to the manner in
which the County Assessor really con
trols the city tax levy is shown by a
statement in the report of Auditor Breed,
made public yesterday. It refers to the
city's total assessment, and then says
"less doubtful assessments, stocks, bonds.
Central Pacific railroad assessments, $1,
--453.950." This amount is on the roll, and
includes the Seventh Street local and
Other property of the railroad that the
State board has declared year after year
to have been assessed as part of the main
line not assessable in any other manner.
During the past week Assessor Dalton
has issued a statement which he says is
in defense of some articles published that
reflect on his administration. The figures
are interesting, but they do not convey a
truthful impression. It states that in
1899 Mr. Dalton assessed the Southern
Pacific Company's property in this county
for a,823,65- more than did Assessor
Leekie in 1894. Mr. Leekie did not assess
the Seventh street local in 1894, and al
though Mr. Dalton put it on the roll he
has not received one cent of taxes upon
it. and after his flrst year of office he
knew that to repeat assessing it was only
a waste of effort. Deduct from Mr. pal
ton's figures for 1899 his assessment of the
local tracks and franchises and add to
Mr. Deckle's figures the value of railroad
improvements since 1894 and it will be
Been that there is very little difference
between the two Assessors' figures. .Mr.
Dalton in his statement uses this ex
ample: , Â,,â
"Reduction in total assessment of 1899
over 1894. Â£8,678.153. Increase in Southern
Pacific Company's assessment in 1599 over
1894, $1,523,650." , .. "".
This would convey the impression that
Mr. Dalton had vastly reduced every
body's assessment from Mr. Decide s fig
ures and had vastly increased the rail
road's assessments. Both of these as
sumptions are false according to Mr. Del
ton's own figures. He had no need to
go back to 1894 because in 189G and 1897,
When he had been in office two or three
yearÂ« he assessed the county much high
er than Mr. Leekie. Mr. Dalton'S figures
are as follows:
1894 $92,814,821
IS<V3 95,434.774
15M.'.'.'.... 94.267.840
jcjr- 94,057,417
1898 '." 83,549,470
is.. ; ; ; ; ; ; 84,i3fi
This shows that not until 1898â the year
in which Mr. Dalton again presented him
self for electionâ did he reduce the as
sessment roll, and then he cut off over
ten millions at a swoop just a couple of
months before the nominating convention
met.
This is no controversy with Mr. Dal
ton, but I have stated that there is al
together too much dust-throwing in the
matter of assessments and tax levies, and
these figures of Mr. Dalton's bear out
the statement. It is surprising that a
man of his shrewdness should have given
out figures that admit of such easy anal
ysis. Mr. Dalton has made a good Asses
sor, but when a public officer parades his
virtues he creates the impression that
they hrve been assumed for political pur
poses only, and that is humiliating.

EMILE MARQUE PASSES
AWAY AT ELMHURST
AGED FRENCH JOURNALIST'S
CAREER AT AN END.
Staunch Friends Provide for Him in
His Adversity and Comfort Him
in the Declining Years
of His Life.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Aug. 6.
Entile Marque, journalist and linguist,
than whom there was perhaps no French
man better known in California, passed
away quite suddenly about 7 o'clock this
morning at Elmhurst.
Time was when the deceased shone re
splendent in the field of French journal-
Ism in San Francisco, possessing wealth,
comfort and friends, but his caustic pen,
with which he vigorously assailed all
.whom he viewed as wrongdoers and ob
structionists to the best Interests of the
French citizens of this Slate, finally
proved his undoing and left him in his
old age poor and bereft of many of his
influential friends.
i In his earlier days he was a true Bo
! hemian, yet temperate and charitable it;
all things save in the use of his vitriolic
' pen, with which he spared not even his
j closest friends who failed to conform to
! his view of what was right and just. He
I was a member of th.. French Hospital
: Society in San Francisco and La League
! Nationale, yet during the hospital contro
versy some years ago he attacked with
.' furious energy friend and enemy alike.
I But withal he was looked upon by the
I French colony in San Francisco as a man
I of honest convictions.
At one time he was a writer on the
! Franco-Californien, and later for severar
i years he published a paper called i.<
! Petit Californien, with an office at the
| junction of Montgomery avenue and
Montgomery street.
Though poor in his declining years, he
would not beg though the door of the
almshouse stood gaping at him.
"Before I go there." be once said. "I
will step behind the las; bush in the path
of mv journey and there sit down and
die." '
i During the last few years he was a suf-
J fer- from Bright's disease, and some
I time ago a coterie of his most ardent ad
| mirers provided him with a cosy little
j home at Elmhurst, where in quiet and
! solitude he might spend his last days.
; There death came to him this morning.
No sooner was his death made known
! than friends hurried from San Francisco
I to take charge of the remains and pro
â  vide a decent funeral, which will prob
i ably take place in San Francisco and
i which promises to be very largely attend

Hunter Injured by the Accidental
Discharge of His Gun.
OAKLAND, Aug. 6.â The accidental dis- '
charge of a shotgun, caused by the trig
ger striking against a stubble of wheat,
nearly cost two hunters their lives this
afternoon near Bryan Station, back of
the fish ranch. The hunting party con
sisted of Antonio Bertola of the grocery
firm of Bertola & Depavo, Otto Sinesky
and James Brewers, both of West Oak
land. The trio were lying on the ground
at the time, when suddenly Bertola spied
a rabbit.
In grabbing the gun hurriedly the trig
ger struck a stubble, discharging one
barrel. Most of the charge lodged in Ber
tola's left foot; the remainder went
through Slnesky's hat.
Bertpla was taken to his home, 1374
Fourteenth street, and a surgeon sum
moned. The injured toes will have to be
amputated.

â¢Documents Stating That There
Is Over Fifty Thousand for Her
in a _iOndon Incti

Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
908 Broadway, Aug. 6.
After struggling to carry on a Home
for Children for a couple of years, and i
doing much good work, Mrs. XV. XV. '
Ayres of this city has just inherited a.
fortune of $52,000. Some years ago the |
Ayres family heard that an uncle, then j
residing in England, had accumulated j
great wealth and had made a will leav- !
ing a generous portion to his niece. Lit
tle confidence was placed in the story, !
but last week a number of documents I
were received in Oakland, all bearing red i
seals and blue ribbons and ornamented
with her Britannic Majesty's lions and )
unicorns, setting forth that the estate j
was being settled and that Mrs. Ayres' j
share was $52,000.
There is yet a procession of red-tape
formalities to be followed before any of
the British gold will reach this country,
but it is an actual fact, attested by a few
barristers and Queen's counselors,
that the sovereigns are in the Bank of
England awaiting distribution.
Many years ago the grandfather of Mrs.
Ayres died, leaving a large sum of i
money in the Bank of England in trust
for his two sons, who were to receive the
interest thereon. At the death of one of
the heirs the whole income was to be ]
enjoyed by the survivor, and at the hit
ter's death the estate was to be distrib- j
uted among the heirs of the old gentle- !
man. Both sons are dead, and the estate j
is now ready for distribution.
W. XV. Ayres was superintendent of the ,
beet sugar factory at Salinas, and about
a year ago he went to the Klondike to
hunt for gold. His wife opened the Hope
of Love for Children in this city, and
afterward transferred it to the Mission
in San Francisco. A few weeks ago she
closed it up. owing to lack of support. A
few- days later she received notice of *her
unexpected good luck.
Nothing has been heard of Mr. Ayres
for several months, and fear is enter- ;
tamed for his safety.
FELL FROM A TRAIN.
OAKLAND. Aug. o.â Michael Daley,
aged 24 and residing at 719 Lombard
street, San Francisco, lies in a critical
condition at the Receiving Hospital.
While on a Berkeley train this afternoon
with his mother and sister, bound for
Shell Mound Park, he either jumped off
or fell from the train at the Sixteenth
street station. He was picked tip un
conscious and taken to the hospital,
where Dr. Bowe and Steward Borchert
treated him for concussion of the brain
and tried to revive him, but up to a late
hour he was still unconscious. So far as
the physicians could ascertain no bones
were broken, and the only external injury
is an abrasion on the forehead.

WORKMEN TO GET
INCREASED PAY
Shipwrights Will Win
Navy Yard Fight.
_EELANAW'S FILIPINO STRIKE
:_TSIST UPON HAVING FISH TO
EAT ONCE A DAY.
Lieutenant Andrews of the Pensa-
cola to Wed â Chief Engineer
Lindley of the Grant Is
Injured.
The members of the Shipwrights' Asso
ciation were jubilant yesterday. They
consider that their fight for the stand
ard rate of wages at the navy yard has
been practically won and in consequence
every shipwright on the front is delight
ed. The regular day's pay for a ship
wright is $5. but for a long time the navy
yard has been paying $4 SO. President
McConnell of the Shipwrights' Associa
tion took up the matter and ln May last
wrote a strong communication to Secre
tary of the Navy Long. In reply he got
a letter stating that the navy yard Board
of Wages, composed of Captain Joseph
Trllley, Commander F. J. Drake. Lieu
tenant C. G. Bowman, Frank W. Hlbbs,
naval constructor, and R. C. Hollyday.
civil engineer, had advised a reduction of
65 nts per day. Ever since that time
the fight has been on In a quiet way and
Senator Perkins. Congressmen Kahn,
Me teal and Loud and State Senator
Luchsinger were drawn Into it. The
shipwrights proved conclusively that $4 80
a day was less than what was paid on the
San Francisco water front. Saturday
night President M Connell made a strong
statement of the rase to the Board of
Wages and was complimented for it by
Admiral KernpfT and Captain Trllley. The
result of the agitation la that the whole
matter will be reported back to Wash
ington ln such a manner as to result in
the shipwrights getting what they have
asked for.
â it was a long fight," said Chairman
McConnell yesterday, "but I am confident
we have won it. We were treated with
every courtesy by Admiral Kempff. Cap
tain Tyrell and the Board of Wages and
we succeeded In proving to their satis
faction that the data unon which the
proposed cut In wages was made were al
together reliable.
The Filipinos on the transport Leelanaw
went on strike yesterday morning. They
demanded fish for breakfast and the
manager had forgotten all about laying
in a supply. They were offered all kinds
of delicacies, but refused them all, say
ing they had been promised fish, and
fish they were going to have. Joseph F.
Cumming ami "Dave" Williamson of the
Mechanics' Institute staff, argued the
question with the villagers, and finally got
them to eat what was set before them
on the distinct understanding that they
are to get a liberal supply of fish to
day. During the afternoon the band that
accompanies the Filipinos played for over
an hour and the wharf alongside which
the transport is lying was crowded with
people listening to the strains of "The
Star-Spangled Banner." "Marching
Through Georgia" and "Hail Columbia."
Sometimes the musicians would jump
from one air to another without any ap
parent reason, but they made a marked
impression on the crowd and should prove
a drawing card at the fair next month.
Among the passengers who will sail for
Honolulu on the Moana next Wednesday
will be Lieutenant Philip Andrews of the
Pensaccla. ii, is going to the Paradise
of the Pacific to marry Miss Clara Fuller,
Jaughtei of the Harbor Master of Hono
lulu. Lieutenant and Mrs. Andrews will
return to San Francisco on the Australia.
Chief Engineer Lindley of the transport
Grant was severely Injured while the ves
sel was at Hongkong and may be a crip
ple for life. He was working among the
ventilating machinery when he slipped
and fell. As he fell he put out a hand
to save himself and it got caught in a
revolving fan. which broke the bones and
tore the tendons in a terrible manner. He
is coming home on the steamer. The
('rant Is now seven days out from Ma
nila with the Idaho, Wyoming and North
Dakota boys.
Charles Anderson fell Into the hold of
the transport St. Paul yesterday and re
ceived some severe lacerations of the
scalp and head, and Thomas Dolan. who
lives at 172 Minna street, slipped and fell
at the corner of Second and Howard
streets and broke his leg. Both cases
were treated at the Harbor Hospital by
Dr. yon der Leith.
J. K. Hanlfy & Co.'s new steamer San
Pedro was out on her builders' trial trip
yesterday. She proved herself to be the
fastest vessel of her class that has yet
been reen on the bay. She averaged 10 3 i
knots an hour during her run, and with
the tide she made 12*_ knots. The San
Pedro is finely fitted out for a limited
number of passengers and will make an
excellsnt lumber or freight boat. No ex
pense has been spared in making the San
Pedro one of the best vessels of her class,
and both owners and builders have rea
son to be proud of her. She will go into
the Eureka trade and will be commanded
by Captain Frank Zaddart.
PAST CENTURY
EMOTIONS AND
MODERN ONES
"Ton do not get away from the modern
In your emotions and hence you do not
create the right atmosphere In your act
ing." This ls so often said that It sets one
thinking. Have not the fundamental joys
and sorrows of the race been about the
same sine, the creation? Was classic
emotion a thing apart from ours? Did
those people not laugh the same laughs,
weep the same tears, suffer and endure
the same heartaches as we? Hope and
despair, joy and sorrow, courage and
f<_r strength and weakness, kindness
and' crueltyâ do they alter as qualities
with the centuries? Differences in mode
of expression; in habit. In custom, in cos
tume, in general surrounding, give the
century color to the atmosphere, but now
can emotions be chronologically tagged
like collected museum antiquities? Can
they be glass cased and railed In like an
cient headgears and good old-model
chairs? "O Hamlet! Thou hast cleft my
heart in twain." hat is the difference
between this and "Hamlet, you have
broken by heart?*; -..â [ why shall we not,
having worked ourselves into such emo
tion, be ourselves in Its expression? "And
I of ladies most deject and wretched,
that suck'd the honey of his music vows,
etc." "And I, the most wretched of
women who once listened in joy to his
vows of love, etc." When thus expressed
does the emotion alter? The poetry of
the classic lines lends a certain music to
the utterance, and actor or actress worthy
of the name cannot divorce the music
from them. They sing of their own voli
tion. What proof have we that this legiti
mate manner of delivery that has won
our affections through long association is
not false mannerism and In a measure
stilted grandiloquence?
Where did the legitimate actor get his
model and what proof has he that people
he portrays acted, walked or talked so?
And the legitimate actor, who to-day
holds the highest place in our esteem.
is he not the ''**'â¢ who savors least of
tradition, who comes nearest to nature as
we in our experience know it? Then
why, if we speak the lines, think the
thoughts, feel the emotions of a play, an
cient or modern, shall we not speak them
with our own tongues, think them with
our own bralnÃ, feel them with our own
hearts? Because the entity and indi
viduality of man or woman of our
acquaintance do not lose themselves in
the folds of a toga or the fall of a tabard,
are we to conclude that their methods are
inartistic? Surely the people of old were
natural, and how can we better present
them and their emotions than by being
natural ourselves? Emotions are no more
the productions of certain centuries than
are souls. CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.

Discussed the Soul.
At the First Church of Christ, Scientist,
yesterday morning a large congregation
listened to an interesting sermon on
"Soul." The citations from the Bible and
"Science and Health, With Key to the
Scriptures," by Rev. Mary Baker G. Ed-
dy, were in part as follows:
The Bibleâ This, then, Is the message
which we have heard of him, and declare
unto you. that God is light, and in him
is no "darkness at all. Â».--___
Science and Healthâ used in Chris-
tian Science, Soul Is properly the syn-
; onym of Spirit, or God. Soul is immortal
because it is Spirit, with no element of
self-destruction. The belief that God
lives in matter is pantheistic. The error
-which saith Soul is in body. Mind 'ls in
matter and Good is in evil, must unsay
it and cease from such utterances.
_ *â¢*â¦"**
Remains Are Identified
The man whose body was found on
Friday in the waters of the bay at Ken-
tucky street was positively identified at
the Morgue yesterday by 010 Olsen,
Gabriel Oleen and Captain Nelson of the
schooner John A. as Jake Swensen, a
member of the schooner's crew. Swensen
was a native of Sweden, aged 47 years.
REBEL CORK
ASSOCIATION
AT A PICNIC
Members Join in Fun
and Frolic.
CROWDS AT SHELL MOUND
MANY VALUABLE PRIZES ARE
DISTRIBUTED.
Races for Young and Old and Jig
and Reel Dancing Contributed .
to the Enjoyment of the
Day.
The thirteenth annual picnic of the
Rebel Cork Benevolent Association was
held at Shell Mound Park yesterday and
was a great success in every detail. The
outings of the association have always
been looked forward to with eager antic
ipation in the past, and it was the gen
eral opinion of all those who attended
that this year's affair eclipsed all former
ones in point of attendance and in the
number of attractions provided for the
guests.
Over five thousand people journeyed
across the bay to the pleasure grounds.
Every train brought crowds intent on en
joying themselves, and the railroad com
panyâthough it added a few extra cars
failed to provide suitable accommodations
and hundreds were obliged to stand. .
There was plenty of amusement at the
park and no one failed to take advantage
of the fact. Fifty-two gate prizes were
distributed to holders of winning num
bers and. twenty-four racing events for
young and old caused much of the fun
of the day. Reel and jig dancing under
the direction of Professors McCarthy arid
McMahon was participated in by many
possessed of nimble feet, and dancing in
the big pavilion to the music of the Hi
bernia Band came in for a large share of
attention
The Rebel Cork Association is composed
of natives of the County of Cork, and has
eight hundred members on Its roll. It is
entirely beneficial in character, and dis
tributes hundreds of dollars monthly in
sick benefits. It is in a flourishing con
dition and has over $10,000 in the treas
ury, t
Following, are the committees having
the outing in charge and to whom its suc
cess was in a large measure due:
Committee on Gamesâ John McAullffe, Tim
othy Fitzgerald, William McCarthy, Patrick
Sullivan, John Driscoll and Jeremiah Cronin.
Programme Committeeâ William J. O'Brien.
P. Corkery*. James Corkery, John Mlnehan and

Gate Committeeâ W. J. O'Brien, Daniel De
lay, C. Cronin. Jeremiah Sullivan, Con Mc-
Carthy, P. Kelleher, Daniel Driscoll, Thomas

J. Dwyer.
The officers of the association areâ President,

THE HOME CIRCLE.
Dr. Locke Delivers the First of a Se
ries of Three Sermons.
Dr. Charles Edward Locke delivered the
first of a series of three sermons on the
"Home Circle" at the Central Methodist
Episcopal Church last night. The church
was crowded to the doors. The subject
of the first discourse was, "When Mar
riage Is Not a Failure." Dr. Locke .aid,
in part:
"This- is a proper subject for pulpit dis
cussion if presented without sensation,
because marriage was established by
Jehovah, treated by Moses in L.c deca
logue, revered by Jesus of Nazareth and
discussed by Peter and Paul, the eloquent
apostles, to the Gentiles.
"Marriage is not to be entered into unad
visedly, but reverently. discreetly and in
the fear of tod. Hasty marriages often
result in continued unhapplness and early
separation. Do not be in a hurry to wed."
Died to End His Misery.
Frederick XV. Arnold, aged SO years,
shot himself yesterday morning at 900
Filbert street. Arnold was old and feeble
and killed himself to get rid of misery.
He had been doing odd jobs for C. H. yon
Heusen, who keeps a grocery store at the
above number. His br "y was removed
to the. Morgue.

ALL IS READY FOR
TO-MORROW'S BATTLE
Rainey Orders the Fire Department to Get
Out and Rustle Hard for Votes,
For Three Days Firemen Need Not Report for
Any Save Inside Alarms-How to Vote
the New Primary Ballot.
THERE are a few more details to be j
arranged before everything is ready |
for the big battle that will open
with the polls to-morrow morning;
there are a few more election offi
cers to be pressed Into service; the
tickets of a half dozen districts to be
printed and the ballot boxes to be dis
tributed, but these are matters of mere
detail and of little significance in the
face of the mighty preparation that has
been going on these past few weeks.
It has been the preparation for the three
cornered battle that is on among the
bosses and between them and the people.
The row that has fractured the Demo
cratic ranks into independent factions,
all warring for the supremacy, has been
on desperately the past few days.
The bosses realize that the fight which
If to begin to-morrow means the elimina
tion of one of them at least from the
politics and perquisites of the city's man
agement. They realize also that, unless
some condition may at the last minute be
brought to bear to disturb the harmony
that now exists among the factions
of the Republican party, to-morrow's
fight will mean the elimination of them
all. The anti-boss movement that has at
tained such stupendous proportions in the
Republican ranks bodes ill to the cliques
that have for so long ruled the city.
Every member of the party is resolved
to elect good men to the convention : nd
to fight for a common cause. It will be
their own fault if they do not win con-
Buckley's sudden accession of Demo
cratic strength has forced the Examiner-
Ralney combination to desperate meas
ures. ' The blind boss was counted a. dead
one until his lambs began to flock Into
the fold. Then It was found necessary to
do something to stop the stampede, and
Rainev fell back on his oldest and strong
est -raft; he Issued his orders to the
Fire Department. From the combination s
headquarters on Saturday went an order
to the district engineers of the depart
ment to call at the Bush-street stable and
get instructions. They turned up as or- j
dered, and were handed slips on which
were printed the names of delegates upon
which' the combination had settled, and
these they were instructed to hand to the
foremen of the different flrehouses to be i
by them distributed among the men.
'in distributing the slips the willing fore- ;
men indulged in a quiet little talK. dic
tated by headquarters, with the men who
were under them. "You know which side
your bread is buttered on." began the In
structions, "and you want to get a move
on and have this ticket win. Interview
every voter in your district and make a :
house-to-house canvass. [1 has been fixed
at headquarters so i hat you need not re
port to your company for any other than |
an inside alarm until Wednesday. Should
an outside alarm come in while you are
out rustling her the foreman or en- â '
gineer will answer rollcall for you."
These are the instructions that have
gone out from the Examiner-Rainey head
quarters, and besides every man has been
carefully instructed upon how to prepare
his allot. That is one point the bosses
are not overlooking. It's a new ballot
that will be used to-morrow, simple [
enoueh. but experience has taught the
bosses that iters will go wrong on the |
easiest of tickets.
At the voting booth of each district the
voter will be provided with a slip contain- 'â¢
ing the names of the delegates of his J
party in that district. He will also be
given a square ballot with space on it al
lotted to each arty that has representa
tion. The ballot that will be used to
morrow has space for the Republican
party, one for the Democratic party, one
for the People's party, another for the so
called Citizens' Republican party and an
other for the Socialist-Labor organiza- '
tion. If he wishes to vote for the Repub
lican delegates of his district he will ask
for a slip carrying the names he desires. ;
This slip will be gummed on the back, :
and in order to vote it he has simply to !
paste it In the space on the square bai
lot designated as that of the Republican
party. Then he will drop it in the bal- -.
lot box.
Concerning the ballot boxes. Registrar !
Steppacher has had a couple of tinners at
work on them for weeks past. They have
so mended the locks and soldered up every
crack and crevice that the only way one
of them can be got into save by the lock .
is with a can opener. Mr. Steppacher says j

This morning the decoration committee
will meet at the office of Henry Fortmann,
president of the Alaska Packers' Associa
tion, 308 Market street. Further consid
eration of many beautiful and novel plans
for the decoration of the city will be taken
up, and some definite conclusions will be
arrived at in order not to delay this im
portant part of the programme.
Preparations for the big benefit to be
given by all the theatrical managers at
the Orpheum on Thursday, August 17,
are rapidly assuming shape, and the per
formance will be the biggest affair ever
witnessed In this city. Manager Meyer
feld of the Orpheum states that already
the demand for the $2 seats is immense,
and he has been besieged with requests
by phone, messengers and even tele
grams from rather distant points. William
Lewis, a cigar manufacturer of 24 Califor
nia street, was the first purchaser of tick
ets yesterday, and he secured options on
the first four seats left after the auction
tale is over.
The auction sale of boxes at the Or
pheum next Thursday will be an interest
ing affair. The following well-known pro
fessional people have signified their in
tention to be present and assist in selling
the boxes: Mrs. Louise Thorndyke Bouci
cault. Miss Mary Van Buren, Miss Manola
Mould. Miss Hattie Bell Ladd, Mrs. Clay
Clement, Miss Mary Linck. Miss Juliette
Crosby, Mrs. F. M. Bates and Mrs. John
Morrissey. A fine orchestra will be in at
tendance, and a handsome sum is sure to
be realized. - tftf " .-' â â -â -â *
Another meeting of nil the managers
will take place this morning to arrange
the complete programme with Stage Di
rector I. ask. who will have a number of
surprises, which he will not make public,
however, until the afternoon of the per
formance, 'tf-'-'tftf.
The vaudeville artists appearing at the
Orpheum, Olympia and Chutes are busy
preparing appropriate acts and songs for
the occasion, and there is already consid
erable rivalry among them regarding the
production of the most original feature.
Whoever falls to attend this monster
benefit will be missing an event that will
possibly never occur again in a lifetime,
-mil It behooves every one who has a
spark of patriotism in his breast to lay
aside the required amount for a ticket and
devote it to the laudable object of fittingly

gave up so much to defend the honor of
their country. *

A POLICEMAN
INJURED WHILE
SAVING A LIFE
OFFICER WILLIAM* E. GWINN
of the Harbor police was serious
ly injured yesterday afternoon in
an attempt to rescue an Italian
teamster from a perilous position.
He was crushed between the back of a
heavy wagon and the side of a box car
and sustained severe injuries on the head
and body. He was conveyed to the Har
bor Receiving Hospital, where treatment
was administered by Dr. Himmelsbach.
OFFICER WILLIAM E. GWINN.
At first It was believed that the officer's
Injuries would prove fatal, but he revived
and at a late hour last night hope was
expressed for his recovery.
Antonio Gotelli, a teamster engaged In
hauling boxed fruit from cars stationed
at Vallejo and Davis streets, had loaded
his wagon and was In the act of roping
the boxes on from behind when the horses
suddenly backed, pinning him between the
side of the car and the end of the wagon.
Officer Gwinn, observing Gotelll's peril,
sprang on the top of the wagon to res
cue the unfortunate man from his dan
gerous position. He succeeded, but the
horses started again and, losing his bal
ance, the brave officer himself slipped
down to the position occupied by the man
he had rescued.
Gwinn 's bead was pinioned between a
high Flat siding of the wagon and the
car and his body was held firm by the
heavy load of boxes. Officer Frank Mc-
Gowan Immediately called several spec
tators to the rescue, and after his fellow
officer had been clasped in this position
for two minutes succeeded in releasing
him. At the Harbor Hospital it was found
that Gwinn's skull was partially fractured
and that he had been internally injured.

Captain Spillane and his men are anx

thief who has been systematically rob
bing *he poor boxes in St. Rose's Church
on Brannan street near Fourth. The
scoundrel is supplied with keys to the
church and has no trouble in robbing the
boxes.
Determined to catch the fellow. Captain
Spillane on Friday night detailed two of
his best men to secrete themselves in the
church in the hope that the thief would
return. After entering the edifice the po
lice officers placed several marked coins
in the box nearest the door and anxiously
awaited his coming.
After three hours* delay one of the of
ficers, who was in the rear of the church,
saw the thief light a match and go to
ward the box in which was stored the
marked coins. He signaled his compan-
I ion and they silently went forward to
I capture him. In the darkness, however,
tne thief managed to escape, after having
' secured about a dollar in nickels and the
j marked coins. '.tf â¢'â : .
The following night the officers again
hid themselves in the church, proposing
to do a better job if the opportunity pre
sented. They remained there until mid
night, but the thief, becoming alarmed
over the previous night's experience, did
not return and they left the place in dis
gust at their failure to catch him.
Captain Spillane is convinced that the
thief has keys to the door of the church
as well as to the poor; box. When dis
covered Friday night he quickly unlocked
the front door, through which he made
his escape, and closed It after him. As
the officers were not familiar with the
lock it was some time before they could
open the door, and by that time the thief
had departed to more comfortable quar
! ters. ______________â_â---.

GERMAN AND AMERICAN
COMMISSIONERS HERE
Bartlett Tripp and Baron Sternberg Arrive
From Samoa on U. S. S. Badger.
Believe That by Abolishing Kingship and Giving
Natives a Large Measure of Self-Government
Peace Has Been Assured.
Samoan Commissioners Bartlett Tripp,
â¢representing the United States, and
Baron Speck yon Sternberg, representing
Germany, arrived from Apia early yester
day morning on board the United States
steamship Badger. C. N. E. Eliot, the
British Commissioner, went from Apia to
New Zealand to visit his sister, and will
come to America, en route to London, on
the next Australian steamer.
The Badger was eight days making the
trip from Apia to Honolulu. At the lat
ter port she took on 200 tons of coal and
then made the run to this port in seven
days and twenty hours. She came into
the harbor with the German and Ameri
can flags flying from the mizzenmast. She
will remain in the stream a few days and
then go to Mare Island for an overhaul
ing.
Commissioners Tripp and Sternberg
came ashore in the afternoon and reg
istered at the Palace. Both were in ex
cellent spirits, the result largely of the
satisfactory manner in which they have
accomplished the arduous task of re
storing peace in the islands.
"We left the natives in a very peaceful
frame of mind and apparently perfectly
content to let hygones be bygones and
live in harmony with one another," said
Commissioner Tripp. "Of course, we can
not say positively that there will be no
further trouble, but we have disarmed
both factions, and before we left Apia we.
were given the most solemn assurances
by the leading chiefs, representing both
Mataafa and Tanu, that there would be
no more fighting."
Baron Sternberg shared the optimistic
v.. . i : *-_> ie: tu-i Â« .im
pressed his firm belief that the commis
sion had evolved a solution of the fac
tional warfare in the island. This has
been largely accomplished by abolishing
the kingship, which has all along been the
chief bone of contention.
"A white Commissioner will be sent to
Samoa to replace the King and his Coun
cil," said Judge Tripp. "He will in effect
be the Governor of the islands. The Chief
Justice will be retained and each of the
three powers will also be represented, as
now, by a Consul. \- -â ';
"One of the principal features of the
new plan of government submitted to the
chiefs, and which undoubtedly had much
to do with their warm approval of the
whole scheme, is the provision granting
the natives a certain form of home gov
ernment. The white Commission while \
having general authority over th*e whole j
group of islands, will not interfere with
the internal affairs of the people, except
in cases of serious infractions of the law.
The people will continue to be governed
| by their chiefs, while the latter will be
! responsible to the representative of the
powers for the maintenance of peace and
order.
"Mataafa showed his sincerity when he
caused his followers to deliver up their
arms and at the last big fono. or big talk,
his representatives presented * a plan of
government for themselves which was al
most identical with the one finally adopt
ed. Of course the plan submitted by Ma
taafa was drawn upon lines outlined jy
us, but his action was nevertheless an
agreeable surprise and showed not only
I his good faith but also his good sense and
! shrewdness. When Mataafa's plan was
read the Tanu chiefs immediately an
nounced that It was perfectly satisfactory
to them."
The Commissioners declined to go Into
further details of the plan as finally
| agreed upon and signed. Judge Tripp
; said Chief Justice Chambers had been
i sustained by the commission, but that he
1 probably would not return to Samoa. In
I regard to the action of Admiral Kautz
i and the British naval officers in shelling
! the native villages, he said that was a
I matter the commission as a body had no
! authority to investigate, but individually
. they would deal with the subject in sepa
j rate reports to their respective govern
i ments.
Commissioner Tripp was loth to discuss
the exclusive publication of the report of
the commission as it appeared in The
! Call.
"I knew absolutely nothing of the pub
! lication of the report," he said, "until I
reached San Francisco. I was dumfounded
! when I. learned that our findings had al
] ready become public property. I under
stand, of course, that it Is the business of
I a newspaper to seek and obtain important
j news, but I hope you will say for me and
' for my associates that we were In no way
j responsible for the publication which The
Call enjoyed.
"We took what we believed to be every
I precaution to prevent the public from j
â¢ -
I learning our conclusions before we pre
j sented them to our Governments, but The
Call circumvented us, and we must ac
cept the situation. In justice to us, how
ever, I hope you will say that we had too
clear a knowledge of our duties to give
knowingly or deliberately to the public
Information which belonged first to the
Governments that we represented."
The Commissioners expect to leave for
Washington to-night. The 3500 rifles taken
from, the Samoans which were brought
j upon the Badger will be taken to Mare
Island. The weapons will be appraised,
and the natives will be remunerated for
their loss. They are satisfied with this
arrangement, and the Commissioners con
sider that they are justly entitled to com
pensation.

day in his fifty-first year.
He had been for many years one of the
prominent officials of the Postal Tele
graph Cable Company in this city, being
at one time the local superintendent. Of
late years Mr. Laven has been In *he
auditing department, occupying the po
sition of chief receiver, which he filled at
the time of his death. He leaves a
widow.
"The Banner of the Cross."
Rev. E. X. lander delivered an interest
ing sermon on "The Banner of the Cross"
last evening before the congregation of
the First English Lutheran Church. In
part he said:
"Our eyes filled with tears when tl.e
returning volunteers carried through our
streets the battle flags and 'Old Glory'
rent and stained. Well, the banner of the
cross has be'en in greater battles, dragged
in the dust of a Savior's humiliation
from Bethlehem to Calvary. But, as our
beloved national flag, though torn by
shot and shell, leads victorious armies,
so Is the banner of the cross an ensign
of victory. There was a time when the
religion of Christ was not considered re
spectable. Men of learning and position
frowned upon it. To be a Christian was
to be an underling. But mark the differ
ence. Christianity has compelled the
world's respect. Infidelity in its tremen
dous efforts to crush it has complimented
its power. And there is not now a single
civilized nation but in Its constitution or
laws pays homage to the religion of the
cross."
The Christian in Politics.
Rev, XV. E. Dugan delivered an earnest
and a practical sermon last night to his
congregation of the Stewart Memorial
!'. P. Church. His topic was "The Chris
tian in Politics." He said: '-'â â '. 'tf?
"It is high time that the Christian
should begin to realize that his religion
Is a thing for every-day life and not a
sacred something to be exercised at the
family altar and displayed before the as
sembled hosts on judgment day. Wheth
er a man stands at the workbench or the
ballot box, his religion should be his con
stant companion. Whenever Christian
people grasp the idea that they are the
purifying agent of the earth and begin
to put their religion into politics we may
hope for better things."
New Mexican Railroad.
General Charles Miller of Pennsylvania
arrived in the city last evening from Mex
ico. He went there some time ago repre
senting a syndicate of Pennsylvania rail
road men who were looking for a location
In Mexico. They have determined to build
252 miles of track from Culican Tobln,
through the provinces of Durango and
Sinaloa. Governor Canedo. of Sinaloa will
meet Genera] Miller to-day to settle mat
ters connected with the construction of
the road in Sinaloa. General Miller is
commander of the Second Brigade of the
National Guard of Pennsylvania. He
visited the camp of the Pennsylvaniana
yesterday and spent a good part of the
afternoon with the men of the regiment.

ing, the victim being M. H. Kinney, who
