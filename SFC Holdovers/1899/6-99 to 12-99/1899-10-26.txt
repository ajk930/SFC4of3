Affairs.
England Has Already Paid Very Dearly in Loss of Life Among
Troops for Her Alleged Victories in Natal, but the Indications
Are That the Greatest Battle of the War Is Now Hourly
Expected
NEW YORK, OoL 25. â A World special from London says: The general British situation in
South Africa is far more serious, according to the World London correspondent's information,
than the rigorously censored dispatches published here would indicate. The proclamation of
President Steyn of the Orange Free State annexing the northern section of Cape Colony has ex
cited only derision here, but the World's correspondent is in a position to state it has a very
grave import
The Cape Dutch In the annexed territory have already risen in arms against the British
Government, and President Steyn's proclamation is intended to relieve them from the conse
quences of their revolt.
This is the first symptom of a race war in Cape Colony, which has been strenuously de
clared impossible by Mr. Chamberlain and the jingoes, but regarded by all sane men as a sure
outcome of the attack on the independence of the Transvaal.
British High Commissioner Milner has issued a counter proclamation warning the Cape
Dutch in the disaffected region that President Steyn's proclamation is of no effect in relieving them
of their allegiance to the British crown. The War Office here has been advised that this is a se
rious development, and the War Board had a prolonged sitting to-day to decide upon military
measures to be adopted in case of a general rising of the Cape Dutch.
The gravity of the situation here is indicated by the measures taken to suppress all news
respecting it in the press here.
It can easily be imagined that the Boers will be greatly encouraged by the knowledge that
the men of their race in Cape Colony have begun to take up arms for their cause.
The other great peril is native intervention in the war. Those familiar with the native
races of South Africa are convinced the effect of Milner's proclamation to the Basutos will be to
incite them to attack the Free State, and that it could have been devised for no other purpose.
It is a matter of supreme importance to the British authorities in the face of a revolt
within Cape Colony to secure a diversion by setting the Basutos against the Free Staters, thus
preventing an effective junction between the Free Staters and the revolted Cape Dutch.
LONDON, Oct. 26.â The Daily Telegraph publishes this dispatch from its special corre
spondent:
KIMBERLEY, Sunday (by dispatch rider to Hopetown, Tuesday).â Klifdam and Windsor
town are occupied by small parties of Boers. The latter village executed formal surrender and
speeches were made. Gert, a burgher and a member of the Second Transvaal Volksraad, told
the inhabitants that a landrosst would be appointed. Martial law was proclaimed. Magistrate
Harmsworth is a prisoner.
LONDON, Oct. 26â With unconscious
humor a * 'ai>e Town correspondent

which is always a deli
cate matter, Is working smoothly
and without a hitch."
This exactly hits off the state of affairs
to-day. An ominous veil is still drawn
over the movements of General Sir
â¢ wart White and General Yule.

with General although this was
not brought about Tuesday night, as an
nounced by the Dally Mail, but some time
on "Wednesday â and as both are now in a
position of safety, conjecture concerns
itself chiefly with the manner of General
Yule's retreat. That it was hasty is evi
dent. Was it disorderly? Was any con
siderable camp equipment abandoned?
Was there any lighting on the way?
Such qutKtions and others like them the
public is anxiously asking. Since the re
ceipt of General White's curious first de
scription < f the Ladysmlth fight, in which
the British lost a hundred men, little re
liance can be placed on the official dls
patchos. While the concealment of the
tacts regarding General Yule's retreat can
be amply justified on the ground of keep
ing the Intelligence from the Boers, the
hiding of the news respecting the Hussars
and Fuslleera, who were apparently cap
tured in the battle of Glencoe, is severely
criticized, no intimation even having been
given that the officers were missing.
The heavy losses of the British troops
in facing only some 8000 Boers are com
mented upon as what the rifle means to
day In the hands of even undisciplined
men .who can shoot fairly straight and
stand their ground. Comparisons are
made with the first employment of the
magazine rifle in the Hispano-American
war, and it Is considered that the Ameri

would have been much heavier if tho
Spaniards had doggedly stood their
ground like the Boers.

wounded. There are thirteen unaccounted for. This lot, however, does not
Include the squadron of the Eighteenth Hussars, which went astray near
Dundee, and the officers of the Dublin FuslleerÃ.
The report of heavy losses sent from Rietfontein came as an unpleasant sur
prise, as General White's telegram to the War Office yesterday gave the impres
sion that there was merely a brush.
The War Office this evening Issued the following:

WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.â The President to-day Issued the following proclamation:
"A national custom, dear to the hearts of the people, calls for tho setting apart of one day In each year
for special thanksgiving to Almighty God for the blessings of the preceding year. This honored observance ac
quires with time a tenderer significance. It enriches domestic life. It summons under the family roof the ab

"Seldom ha.s this nation had greater cause for profound thanksgiving. No great pestilence has Invaded our shores.

Mr Chamberlain also denied that he
had refused to see Dr. Montague White,
the agent of the Transvaal, who, the
Colonial Secretary added, had never ap
plied for an audience.
The Speaker. William Court Gully, in
tervened at this juncture and declared
that all references to such matters were
out of order.
The pugnacious spirit animating the
public has reached the legislators. Apart
from the diversion created by Mr. Davitt
there was a lively scene in the House
between Gavin Brown Clark, Radical
member for Caithness, ex-agent of the
Transvaal, and Major Rasch, Conserva
tive member for the southeast division
of Essex. Mr. Clark denied Major Rascn's
6tatement that he (Clark) was in the
Boer camp at the time of the fight at
Majuba Hill, and characterized the as
sertion as a sample of the misrepresen
tation now prevailing.
Major Rasch promptly retorted that his
statement was made on the authority of
Mr. Clark himself, who told him so six
pears ago, adding if Mr. Clark again de
nied the statement he, the major, would
take the first opportunity of repeating
the statement to him outside of Parlia
ment, when he could take what steps he
liked.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt, the
former Liberal leader in the House, said
he desired to again call attention to the
provocation of the Secretary of State for
the Colonies (Mr. Chamberlain) during
the negotiations and in his speech at
Highbury.
Mr. Chamberlain replied, repudiating
the Intention to be provocative and saying
he only intended to be plain and free
from ambiguity. He added that he only
followed in the negotiations the princi
ples observed by all statesmen during the
past ten or twenty years. There was a
time, he explained, when diplomacy was
regarded as given to -statesmen to enable

LONDON. Oct. 25.â Michael Da
vltt. Irish Nationalist member for
South Mayo, announced In the
House of Commons to-day that he
would resign to-morrow, as a pro
test against the Boer war. Mr.
Davttt dt-nounced the jingo press,
and said that the war " for the
meanest and most mercenary aims
would be known as the greatest
crime of the century. He declared
that if he had been offered home
rule and an Irish republic he would
not have accepted them If accom
panied by the condition that he
vote for the war. As a protest, he
would ask to be relieved from at
tendance in the^House. He had
been In the House for five years
trying to obtain Justice for Ire
land, and he left it convinced that
"no cause of justice and right
would have the support of the
House unless backed by force." Mr.
Davitt's resignation was something
of a coup do theatre, as the Pall
Mall Gazetu- says that some time
ago he told his Intimate friends
that he would take the lirst oppor
tunity of retiring from Parliament.
It is understood that Mr. Davitt

them tr> conceal their thoughts. That
might fairly be called the "old diplo
macy," which, he said. "I absolutely re
pudiate. People," he continued, "are en
titled to demand a clear exprc=Fi"ii of
views, and there was never the slightest
justification for the statement that Presi
dent Kruger had been in doubt."
Mr. Chamberlain then said: "Our ob- i
jects. methods and determination were to i
carry out these plans. It was neces- j
sary to Impress upon President Kruger
the seriousness of the step he was called i
upon to take and the consequences which ;
would follow any mistake on his part. It i
was not desirable to Include In an offi
cial dispatch collateral suggestions and
Indications of opinion, but semi-official
warning was frequently conveyed in a
speech. A similar warning was given by
Lord Salisbury to the Sultan at the Gulld
hali banquet and I am still absolutely
unrepentant."
Regarding Mr. Davitt Mr. Chamberlain
bald he recognized that he had hlthertG
discussed the matter moderately and sin
cerely, "and," he added, "I would pay ;
the greatest attention to hlB arguments !
if I did not know he would use precisely â â 
the same arguments In regard to any \
British war, which are based on his en- j
mity to England.
"What would have been the Irish ar- j
gument in the Spanish-American war, in |
which Spain showed herself infinitely les3
capable of defending herself than the
Transvaal "
Here William Redmond, Parnelllte i
member for East Clare, shouted: "The I
Transvaal did not blow- up your war
ships."
Mr. Chamberlain continued: "The great, I
almost determining contest between the i
United States and Spain, was fought j
without the loss of a single American.
We have never denied that the Transvaal
was a foeman worthy of our steel. Not
only was the disparity In the forces in the
Spanish-American war as great as those
now engaged, but the contention of the
United States and their right of interfer
ence arose from the fact that at the
same distance from their territories there
was oppression, not of American citizens
but of another race and people, and justi
fied the intervention of the United States
in the mind of the civilized world, or at
any rate, in the eyes of Englishmen and \
Irishmen. But we are interfering in be- :
half of our own people. It Is perfectly
certain that Mr. Davitt, but for his hatred
of England, would sympathize with us as
he did with America."
Mr. Chamberlain then replied to the
criticism of his note accepting the medi
ation of Mr. Hofmeler, the Afrikander I
leader, pointing out that while he believed
Mr. Hofmeier was sincere, yet he could
not forget that when President Kruger j
made "absolutely compulsory proposals I
for a settlement," Mr. Hofmeler was per- j
fectly ready to accept them. President
Kruger misled Mr. Hofmeler In promis
ing him proposals which differed materi
ally from those he really presented.
"There has been on the part of the
Transvaal crookedness altogether incom
prehensible If they desired a settlement,"
continued Mr. Chamberlain. "I be
lieve that from first to last Presi
dent Kruger never Intended to
give anything approaching equal
rights to the white races, or any j
acknowledgment of British supremacy. ,
War, therefore was inevitable. There has
been an enormous strain upon us. We
are called upon to bring the war to a I
quick conclusion and .send across the Â«ea
a force ruch as no nation In history ever
before sent. This is entirely due to the
preparations which made the Transvaal
an armed camp ami which not only se- |
â¢ cured It a defensive position, but enabled j
â  It to take the offensive against ihe large
: forces now engaged.
"Such a thing could not b* continued I
forever. We have needed a permanent j
force of 25.000 In South Africa. We are I
\ told wo fcball lose South Africa, Our J
foreign friends are convinced of it. Yet '
they are not happy. Such predictions |
j were made before and were even current !
in the days of Elizabeth. But I am no*
j alarmed. One great Teutonic people can
i not hold :n subjection another great Teu
tonic people, but this has never been our
course. It is impossible to' pretend that
the Dutch at the Cape are crushed by our
j rule, when they have all the rights
! Englishmen possess, and even in In
dividual cases are permitted to talk and
' write treason. Whatever may be the |
| result of the war and the premature talk i
| of the result from the present war does i
; any one imagine that we shall fall to do
for others what we claimed for ourselves,
i or refuse equal rights to the Dutch in the
â  Transvaal, which they refused us?"
The House finally, by a vote of 224 to
! 28, passed the second reading of the ap
propriation bill.

PREPARES FOR
ANY FOREIGN
COMPLICATIONS
LOXDON, Oct. 25-The extent of the
British preparations revealed by to-day's
information causeÃ a strong reiteration |
of the rumors of serious foreign complica
tions. It is now said that Rear Admirrrl
Lord Charles Beresford will command the
Mediterranean squadron, and details of
the activity at the dockyards and naval
stations are coming in hot and fast. It
is said that, whether or not Great Britain
seriously fears Russia* or French aggres
sion, the naval preparations have been
under consideration for several months,
and it was the Admiralty's intention to
put them in force as soon as war was nr>
clared, it being deemed necessary to in
crease the active strength of the navy in
order to insure the large fleet of trans
ports against every possible contingency.
The Times, commenting editorially on
the rumor of European intervention,
scouts the idea, and says: "No power will
lift a finger. The alarming combinations
built upon our naval movements have no
existence save in overheated imagina
tions."
Dispatches from the Continent to the
Daily Mail say that the French fleet haa
received instructions to watch the move
ments of the British Mediterranean
squadron and that the Italian fleet is un
der orders to concentrate in the Bay of
Spozia.
QUEEXSTOWN, Oct. 25â The British
cruisers Furious, Pelorus and Pactolus
sailed from here this afternoon, en route
to Cape Clear, where they will meet eight
battleships and two cruisers of the Chan
nel squadron from the North of Ireland.
The fleet will then proceed ostensibly to
Gibraltar, but it is thought that possibly
its destination is a Spanish or Portuguese
port, as the vessels have taken out bills
of health from the Consuls of those coun
tries.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.â Interference
by continental Europe in the war between
Great Britain artd the South African Re

about a settlement of the war. Up to
this time It Is stated authoritatively that
the United States has not been ap

its influence to bring an end to hostilities,
and it was stated significantly that na
tions of the continent are unlikely to
make such a suggestion in view of their
understanding that the President does not

until he is informed by both Great Britain
and the South African Republic that they
will be willing for him to mediate.

there will be no interference In the war
Is based upon the fact that the British
Government still has Its strong armâthe
navyâ free to use in any direction that
may appear necessary. Thero lias not
been any considerable strengthening of
the naval force in South Africa, because
there is nothing for It to do In that di
rection. War in that region Is purely a
military problem. Great Britain thus has
practically her entire naval strength pre
pared to resist the Intervention of any
third power, and it is the suggestion In
this connection that the mobilization of
her Mediterranean squadron at Gibraltar
is simply a step in the direction of pre
paredness. The movement of the French
squadron In the Levant is not believed to
have any reference to the Transvaal war.

â Â« â
Perished With Their Flocks In
stead of Seeking Safety From
the Storm's Fury.
Special IMspateh to The Call.
MINNEAPOLIS. Oct. 25.â A special
from Glen Falls. Mont., says: If
any one has concluded that the
time has passed when the servant
Is as faithful to the interests of
his master as he, could be to his
own, he should consider the Btory of the
recent blizzards which swept through
Teton County, in the northern part of this
State, a county given up to the raising of
sheep and cattle. As a result of that
storm nine men are known to be dead,
and the bodies of five have been recov
ered. With one exception all were sheep
herders, and all were found lying in such
positions as to indicate that they had
stayed with their bands to the laat, dying
in their attempts to save the property of
their employers.
William <;raham. working for the Cus
â ';i<t. i.and Company, was found in a
coulee near Healy Butte. It is evident
that ho had tried hard through the night
to get his sheep into camp, but had not
6U( ci -'led. Conscious of the death which
w;\s impending, he returned to his twit
about midnight, and there wrote and left ;
a note saying he was nearly exhausted, i
but was about to return to the shoep^j
whioh were drifting up the c>>ulee. He [
w;;s found stretched on the snow, his
lantern about twenty feet distant. Of his;
two dogs, one remained to guard the body
while the other followed the sheep. He
was unmarried and recently said that he
had not a relative In the world.
Norman Bruce worked for Will Flow*
eree. He remained with his sheep until
he mAhfeged to drive them into a sheltered !
spot, where they would be safe. Blinded
by the storm, he mistook the coulee where
his cabin was built .'-nd wandered upon
another. RgaHSing his mistake too late.
he turned back and fell less than 200 yards |
from his home and safety. The searching
party found his dogs stretched across the
body Bruce was unmarried and a
native of.JEJrtnce Edward Island.
Mix Gregonch w;,s round with his arms l
frozen upon hia breast. His dog had fol- i
lowed the sifeep into camp and returned!
w : t } i the rescue rmrty too late.
H. E. Herald, working for S. C. Schiff- |
in. was lying in the deep snow, hia beard :
eaten off by the sheep, which had also
eaten his clothes- and part of his boots.
This is only a portion of the pathetic
Bide of the disaster, and the fidelity of one
herder is probably no greater than that
of any other. It is probable the death list
is hardly begun. Bands ot sheep without
herders have been reported from various
points in the storm district, and later
these will be traced and the dead herders
found.
Now the snow covers up everything on
the prairie, and the coulees, many of them
more than 100 feet deep, with steep sides,
are filled with it. Without exception this
\>as the most severe and most fatal Oc
tober storm ever occurring in Montana.
now nearly 100.000 men in the field, made

A special dispatch from Pretoria, dated
October 24, purports to give an interview
with one of the highest Transvaal execu
tives, who is quoted as having urged that,
while the Boer successes 1 were yet unim
portant, there was still time for an amic
able settlement, as he believed the Boers
had been misled as to the real issue.
PROTEST OF THE
GERMANS AGAIST
TRANSVAAL WAR
BERLIN, Oct. 25.â At a meeting of 3000
members of the Pan-German and Anti-
Semite League at Hamburg to-day, called
to protest against the Transvaal war, a
dispatch was sent to Emperor William
full of solemn patriotic effusions and urg
ing him to intercede in behalf of the Boera
and postpone his journey to England.
The Vossische Zeitung, commenting on
this, says: "Vigorous protests, should be
'made against passionate and malevolent
I treatment of the war, which gives color
to the idea that the Germans cannot do
enough to show their enmity for Great
Britain. The majority in this country
have nothing in common with the Anglo
phobia in which the Hamburg meeting
waded."
The paper then quotes Prince Bis
marck's dictum that Great Britain's
friendship is more useful to Germany
than the whole valley of the Nile and the
pyramids, adding: "Had Prince Bis
marck been an English Minister he would
have acted toward the Boers like the
English Government has done."
The Berliner Neueste Nachrichten de
scribes President Steyn's proclamation as
a "false step that may have serious re
sults. "
The Kolnische Zeitung pays a tribute
of gallantry to the British officers, point
ing out that of the German loss in the
battle of Spicheren only 4V4 per cent were
officers, while at Glencoe and Elands
Laagte the British officers killed and
wounded was 14^ per cent of the total
loss.

WOLSELEY HAS
DOCTORED REPORTS
FROM THE FRONT
LONDON, Oct. 25.â The commander-in
chief. Field Marshal Lord Wolseley, has
apparently now been convicted of "doc
toring" official reports from the front.
and there is a strenuous demand on all
sides for a reversion to the earlier prac
tice, when the reports of General Sir
Stewart White, the British commander in
Natal, were given out textually as soon
as received. The commander-in-chief's
summary, as read in the House of Com
mons yesterday, spoke of General White
having fought a successful action,
whereas General White's own account
puts an entirely different complexion on
the situation, reduces the movement to
its proper proportions and shows that
further exciting intelligence may be ex
pected from the same quarter at any mo
ment. It is quite evident that the war
in Natal has only commenced, and that
the Boers are by no means discouraged
at losing the first Jtwo battles. Many ex
perts are satisfied* that General Joubert
is even now close to the heels of the
British, and that a decisive action may
be fought soon.
The main fact that the British were
forced to evacuate the Natal triangle.
Which the Boers naturally and rightly
claim as a conspicuous success, and
which they even emphasize by a procla
mation annexlng'Northern Natal, is prov
ing an unpalatable pill to the public,
whose appetite has been whetted by the
previous successes, which had been as
sumed to be greater than they really
were, as the determination and gallantry
of the Boers enable them to quickly re
organize and achieve desired objects by
other methods.
Later estimates of the Boers' losses at
Elands Laagte give 300 killed. Their cool
ness, bravery and good aim can be judged
from the fact that out of seventeen or
eighteen officers with the half battalion
of Gordon Highlanders, four were killed
and thirteen were wounded, while the
casualties among the rank and file were
27 per cent during less than three hours'
firing. Lieutenant Campbell of the Gor
don Highlanders has since died from his
wound*.
GENERAL SYMONS IMPROVED.
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 25.â Intelligence re
ceived here yesterday from Natal says
the bullet has been extracted frum the
wound of General Symons. who was
struck while leading his troops at the bat
tle of Glencoe, and that the patient it

yellers were not massed aa is the rule,
but were scattered in small groups
throughout the closely packed area and
but for an extemporaneous orchestration,
happily perfected at the first attempt,
might have lost their charm. As it was
they took on a harmony striking, original,
effective and probably never to be dupli
cated.
Musical "hi yippi yonders" and "hookey
wow wows" kept the crowd in splendid
spirit until a fanfare from the band gave
notice that the Inaugural procession was
making its way down the cinder path.
In a minute it was on the outskirts of
the throng and the next was making its
way acroes the brief open space to the
stand. Everybody rose to watch its pro
gress and the collegians redoubled their
Vocal demonstrations of delight.
First, leading the way, came Professor
Soule, and following close after came
Regent Hallldie, the Rev. Horatio Steb
bins. Regent Houghton, President Wheel
er, President Daniel C. Oilman of Johns
Hopkins and President David Starr Jor
dan of Stanford, all three presidents in cap
and gown. Following came the regents, in
cluding Mrs. Hearst, the members of the
faculty, their ladies and the invited
guests, among whom wore United States
Senator George C. Perkins and Major
General Shatter.
Handclappings and cheers sounded
loudly aa the regents and their guests
took their seats on the platform and col
legiate questionings as to who was all
right mingled with a Meyerbeer overture
to bring out alternate responses that Oil
man and Jordan and Wheeler were all
right. A yell was improvised for Johns
Hopkins, which is not supposed to havo
such an article, and yells were sounded
for Stanford and Berkeley, and the en
thusiastic alumni and undergraduates
were still yelling when Regent Hallidk
arose to call the great gathering to order,
introducing Dr. Voorsanger, who offered

covered in the sun as he invoked the
blessings of the Father on the work about
to be formally inaugurated.
At the conclusion Regent HaUidie, to
whom the regents had decreed the honor
of inaugurating the new president, ad
dressed the assemblage. He said in part:
REGENT HALLIDIri'S ADDRESS.
Twenty-seven years ago, lacking two weeks,
the Board of Regents of the University of
California called you together in Oakland to
witness the inauguration of one of the dis
tinguished men of the country as president of
thin- university, whose career since his depart
ure from these shores, over a quarter of a
c_>ntury since, has been upward and forward
and lull of distinction' and honor, and whose
presence here to-day emphasizes his early love
tor California and for its university. A few
months later, on July 16, 1873. you were sum
moned to meet for the first lime on these
grounds, when the university formally entered
upon the site at Berkeley and when President
Ijaniel C. Gllman addressed the graduating
class of twelve, the first of the university's
four-year classes, telling them they were
Jurors sworn to tell truth and bidding them to
be apostles bearing everywhere the Master's
lessons.
irty you are summoned to witness th"
Inauguration as president of this University of
a man alike distinguished In the world of k-t
--ters as a scholar and, in the world of af
fairs, loved as a citizen. By a happy eon-
Junction we are honored, too, by th>- pr<??-noe

In California the State University has been
broadened and stimulated by the presence and
kinship of the Iceland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, founded by Leland Stanford, ex-Gov
ernor and United States Senator, and main
tained through the delays and uncertainties
of litigation, the perils and vicissitudes of
youth by the loyalty and unselfishness of a
noble womanâ honor to herâ the widow of
the founder; and California has become richer,
too, by the presence of that other wise man
of the East, President David Starr Jordan.
And now another wise man of the East comes
to Berkeley, yea, even from Ithaca, and bends
before the shrine of duty to devote that man
hood which God has graced him with to the
cause of learning, progress and humanity.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1899.
Regent Hallldie admitted a few mo
ments later that it was wholly super- \
flous for him to introduce President David j
Starr Jordan, and so the event proved, j
No sooner had the stalwart hoad of Stan
ford reared itself on the assembled vision
than it was greeted with c.n outburst ol
good will. Three times did he essay a j
beginning of his address and three times
was he compelled to bide such time as the
demonstrative collegians got through j
dinning in his and everybody's ears 'what |
a good fellow they considered him. At j
last he was allowed to proceed, but not ,
to finish before he had many times over
reason to feel proud of the good feeling
for him in the Berkeley breast. His j
references to the united front the two :
universities should present to the world !
and his predictions on the future of Presi- |
dent Wheeler were particularly ac
claimed. He said in part:
PRESIDENT JORDAN'S GREET
ING.
I am asked us a loyal citizen of California,
and a* a representative from the sister re
public of letters which California cherishes
across the bay, to add a word to the generous
welcome which Calirornla gives to the presi
dent of her univeiFlty My word, Mr. Presi
dent, shall be a word of advice. Not that you
need it or should ever heed it. but becausa
there la no othtr article of value with which
I can so willingly part.
II is a saying of Kmerscn that "Colleges
can only serve us when their aim Is not to
drill, but to create. They draw every ray
i,: varied genius to their hospitable halls an 1
by their concentrated influence set the heart
of the youth in flame."
This function ot the college rests with you.
It is for you, Mr. President, not to drill, but
to create. It In for you to give personality to
the University of California. Color and char
acter must come through your hand. Your
Influence must draw those rays of varied
*enlup which shall set the heart of our youth
In llamo.
It Is your place, Benjamin Ide Wheeler,
is president of The great university of our
great State, to construct your purpose and your
pulioy, and to give the university Its per
sonality, Its color and it* atmosphere. Above
all rest- with you the firming of Its moral
tone, for alter nil chnracu-r-buildlng It-' the
noblest work of the university, and I am nn:
of those who believe â  that â¢In this work the
i.nlverstty may be made the most effective
agency. I have known you for many year*,
Dr. Wheelerâ twelve years, is it not, In all?
Always adequate to the work the gods set
you to do. I know that you will not disap
point us now. I know that you can meet
and will meet all that the State expects of
you. Because this Is so I regard this day,
this ;.',th day of October, ISS9, as one of the
greatest, full cf the fullest of hope, of all
the days In the calendar of California,
Some time aeo a repent of the university
said to me, "Now that we have Whoe'er we
murt change our notion of rivalry. Hence
forth It shall not be BerkÂ»ley against Stan
ford nor Stanford Â«c;airFt Berkeley, but Cali
fornia against the world." Now. In all seri
ousness, why not? Why not Berkeley and
Stanford, together and indivisible, against the
world?
It has been Dr. Wheeler's good fortune and
mine to sit at the feet of the same great
master -Andrew D. White. We can remem
ber President White's appeal to his alumni
that wierever we mlirht go we should stand
by "our State universities, for In them is the
educational hope of the South and West." We
of Stanford are not deaf to thiÂ« appeal. We
are citizens of California, loyal and true. We
rhall stand by our State university, for In
its development Is the educational hope of our
golden west, and we pledge to President
wheeler our help In fullest loyalty, whenever
and wherever and howsoever ho may ask our
aid.
An orchestral selection, "The Palms,"
preceded the introduction of Daniel Colt
Oilman, president of Johns Hopkins Uni
versity and president of the University of
California from to 1875, who had been
invited by the regents at the suggestion
of President Wheeler, to deliver the ad
dress." The spontaneous burst of good
feeling that greeted his appearance must
have done his heart good. It brought
smiles to his face and he bowed right and
left to the great throng-. As in the case
of President Jordan, It was some moments
before he thought prudent to wade into
the surf of applause, and time and again
throughout its delivery he was forced to
yield to the vociferous manifestations' of
"the effects his remarks had upon his
hearers.
Dr. Oilman's address was in three parts.
First, In the warmest terms he congratu
lated the University, of "California on the
accession of President Wheeler; next, by
request, he gave a brief summary of the
recent progress of American universities,
and. finally, he Indicated some points in
which It seemed to him that the Univer
sity of California should surely excel. He
said in part:
PRESIDENT GILMAN'S CON-
GRATULATIUNS.
I congratulate you on the succession of great
gifts which have supplemented the appropria
tion* of tnp State and have helped to attract
t . this place t!irongs of young men nnd maid
ens In the pursuit of a liberal education. With
li.artiness for which no tones can be too em
phatic. I congratulate you nn the far-sighted
munificence of that generous woman, whose
nope it Is that the buildings of this unlvctwlty
shall be worthy of Ita alms, and who dpslrwi
that this nhall not be constructed haphazard.
Few persons know as I do what a persistent,
sagaclouÃ and successful search the regents
made for a president. If they were eager to
giv? an example of original Investigation,
which tests alert until a flnalMy Is reached,
they could not have done better. But their
difficulties did not end with their discovery;
persuasion was harder than research. The
leader of their choice had received many pre
vious caljs. to which his ear remained deaf.
The ties of Intellectual and sound friendship,
the assurance that a professor's chair Is stable,
while a president Is usually offered a rock-
Ing chair, which looks more comfortable, but la
really fchaky, and the consciousness that In an
1 old State the traditions of education are secure
I of recognitionâ all these considerations were of
: weight. He has wisely decided; greater oppor
; tunitles on a broader field, the generous sup
port of the authorities and that large minded
; ness which has ever been an alluring charac
teristic of the Callfomians, have captured him;
i and now with one vol<^e his old friends In the
: Kast, his new friends in the West, bid him
j God speed. Bind him now with bands of steel;
i strengthen his hands; confirm his plans; listen
I to his couneel, and soon you will know what
1 you now believe, that the right man Is hereâ
i suggestive, strong, hopeful, wise and Inspiring
j ready to promote the vigor, the industries the
wealth, the literature, the science, the arts,
j the politics and the religion of this great
I State.

SCENES AT
PRESIDENT WHEELER'S
INAUGURATION.
comes President' Wheeler has received
since "he last came within the confines of
California. President Wheeler arose to
deliver nis inaugural message to his
people. The applause died away and the
assembly, regents, faculty, students,
alumni and friends of the university
settled back to drink in every word. And
<â <> strong and frank was that message
nnd .so earnest was the manly tone in
which it was delivered that few cared to
interrupt Irs delivery with the applause
it. deserved. It left no doubt as to the
course of the new president, and it left
no one '.ess sanguine of the future. There
was no shadow of promise in it that did
not assure the substance of performance.
It was sincere to the point of spellbind
ing, and when its last word had been
uttered it was a several seconds before
the applause expressive of full satisfac
tion was offered. In part President
Wheeler's message reads:
PRESIDENT WHEELER'S MES-
SAGE.
Ton have laid upon me a heavy task' you
have intrusted me with a high responsibility;
you have crowned me with opportunity. A
consciousness of my own limitations, which
time and experience have made reliable and
definite, would have forced the gleam of op
portunity Into the thick shadow of the task
had not your hearty confidence, which . placed
both in my â  way. called faith to the seat of
distrust.
If all the : pressing nerds of the university
â were marshaled in array long would be the
list. If the university work Is to be main
tained on its present level of efficiency greatly
increased supply of funds for the plain work
of Instruction must be supplied from some
source, private or public.
Among the demands for the Internal devel
opment of the university none rank in my
estimation with those of the library. Instead
of 75,000 volumes there ought to be to-day 300,
--000. Instead of an Income for purchases of
$4000 there ought to be $30,000. A fireproof
building equipped with seminary rooms on the
largest scale must be provided within the next
three or four years.
The newly founded school of commerce en-
ters upon a wide and hopeful field. Here of
all places in the land is the chosen spot for
the training of those who are to be the In
telligent . â¢ guides and emissaries of trade,
whether as trade agents of private Interests
or as consuls who represent through the Gen
eral Government the public interest. Here can
be collected to best advantage data concerning
the condition of markets in the Asiatic world.
In th" fi>-ld of mlnir.g engineering we must, of
course, lead the world. In agriculture we must
have ihe unquestioned best, and particularly
in the applications of agriculture to pomology
and horticulture we must hnve the means of

what Is now provided. .Not only â  the naked
hills of California, but the whole western
slope. of the. continent. call for special study of
the forest problem. A school of forestry Is an
earnest and instant need. The waters that sent

glneerinc â 
The uncertain relations of the various pro
fessional schools to the body of the university
will demand, -careful attention in the Imme
diate future. The university cannot per
mently lend the use of its name to depart
ments or institutions over which it has no real
control. The whole problem is not bo much one
of legality, however, or of control, but one of
thorough co-operation and of the prevention of
duplication in academic work.
The presidency of an American university Is
to-lay the medium of communication between
the two main elements which give a. university
life and being. The incumbent of the office, aa
holding a dual relation, is not only subject to
misunderstanding and to tne consequent and
common charge of duplicity, but Is placed In a
position that is frankly untenable, except with
the full confidence and loyal co-oneratlon of
faculty and regents alike. At the present stage
of its development the â¢ office in demandlns a
sympathy with, too widely sundered , points of
view demands almost the impossible and Is the
most difficult position which American society
can call upon a man to fill. All this I have
fully considered. None of this have :I â¢ con
cealed from myself. I throw myself, regents,
faculty., students, fully and frankly. and trust
fully upon your loyal support. Without that
I am nothing; with that we can accomplish

SUGGESTIONS FOR
A BETTER NAVY
Admiral Melville Sub
mits His Report.
Bprc'al DUpatcb ro The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.â Tho throe
leading features of the annual report of
Admiral Melville, engineer In chief of the
navy, are tho chapl ted to per
sonnel, to the merits of olectric versus
siea:n machinery and the proposition to
lidate the naval construction work.
The general lessons of the war, it is
said, were In no way indicative of any
desirable change in the machinery of our
with the exception of increasing
thf evaporating r- a "* s and the adoption
with all practicable and economical
promptness of the water tube typa of
boilers.
Admiral Melville expresses his Inabil
ity to Bee indications of the benefits to
the navy which were expected to result
from the operations of the personnel. He
said that his hope was to see a vast ad
dition to the number of officers who
would give attention to engineering mat
ters, and he still hopes that a compre
hensive union of the line of engineering
vocations will result and that no depart
ment regulations may be permitted which
Will prevent this consummation. Depart
mental regulations Insisting upon service
of the line officers alternately in the en
gine rooms as well as on deck are neces
sary, he says, to give them practice.
An Important chapter in the report
deals with the scope of the work now
executed by the Bureau of Steam En
gineering, which is set out in order to
combat the proposition to amalgamate
the constructive bureaus of the Navy De
partment, a matter which the admiral re
grets has area been speculated on.
He says that not only '- the trend of
modern mechanical works in all branches
toward incre;u*od specialization, but the
wisdom of such a trend Is not questioned
by the leading talent in the outside world
of constructive work.
The Steam Engineering Bureau has
finally arrived at the conclusion that it is
a mistaken policy to carry so far along
the practice of driving the auxiliary ma
chinery of ships by electricity, and the
present report presents a strong line of
reasoning to support it.

JEFFRIES
LETS UP IN
HIS WORK
Champion Spars a Lively
Six-Round Match With
Tommy Ryan.
Special Pif- ' CMt>
NEW YORK. Oct. 25.â Having satisfied
himself that his -wind is now good and
physical condition almost up to the atan
ard of excellence required lor champion
ship lights. James J. Jeffries has cut down
his programme work slightly. The new
order of things went into' effect at the
Jeffries camp, at Allenhurst. N. J., to
day. Instead of taking a six or seven mile
run, as has been the custom since he be
gan to prepare for the contest with Shar
key, the California!! took only two miles
of road work. The style of his work is
rent from that which marked the six
and seven mile journeys. On the lung
runs he jogged the greater part of the
distance. To-day he sprinted about a
hundred yards, then slowed down for a
like distance and sprinted at the end. He
was paced by a bicycle and although a
stiff rate of speed was maintained by the
rider, the world's champion was not far
behind at the finish.
In addition to the road exercise. Jef
fries had 11 six-round bout with Tommy
Ryan. They mixed things up in lively
fashion uring the eighteen minutes fight
ing, and 'effrlea did not appear at all dis
tressed at the conclusion of the exhibi
tion. His injured left hand appears all
right again and he made considerable use
of it in delivering and stopping blows,
The Californlan also played several games
of handball and had a short wrestling
bout with Roeber.
Jeffries looked considerably lighter than
when he fought FiUssimmons, but his
muscles seem much harder and there Is
less superfluous flesh on his body than
when he exchanged blows with the for
mer world's champion. Jeffries pays that
he is in fine Bhape and he is confident he
will be able to successfully defend the
title of champion of the world against
Sharkey when they meet at the Coney
Island Club's arena on November 3.
Bharkey' work of to-day was of a very
mild character, consisting of Jogging on
the road. Tom O'Rourke, who looked the
pallor pugilist over critically, said ho was
satisfied with Shark^y? condition, and
ndded that if the sailor was in ns good
physical trim on November 3 as he Is
now he had no fears of the resnlt.B^B^B^

"When Jeffries and Sharkey fight at
Coney Island November 3 it will be a
meeting of the two greatest close-quarter
fighters that ever put on gloves. Their
huge .arms and massive shoulder develop
ment enables them to send In awful
punches at short range, and In these
drives of six or eight Inches, Jeffries
standing 6 feet 1 inch, will bo at a dis
advantage.
In other styles of fighting, however,
this extra height will give the champion
an advantage. His Jaw will of necessity
be farther away from the sailor a ter
rific hooks, and Tom's straight punches
will seldom reach his face. Taking the
fighters as they are to-day it would seem
impossible to find two men more evenly
matched. "What Kharkov lacks in height
and reach he makes up in speed. He Is
especially deficient in reach. Of the six
prominent heavy-weights before the pub
lic now, his is the shortest reach of all.
Jeffries Is first with 76* inches, McCoy
is next with 76 inches, then Fitzsimmons
75Vs. Maher 74. Corbett 73, and lastly
Sharkey, whose longest reach of arm
measures only 70 inches.
This little matter of six and three
fourths inches does not affect Sharkey's
confidence in the least. The burly sailor
won't start in to make this bout a spar
ring match. He expects from the first
tap of the bell to go in and plug, with a
chance of landing on a vital spot the
blow that will pet the money.
Jeffries looks for nothing else than this
same business of slugging and Is prepar
ing himself accordingly.
He expects Sharkey to come in with a
rush, and thinks that the sailor will be
in distress before he gets to where his
short-arm blows will count. The cham
pion is a typical two-handed fighter and
a blow landed properly with either hand
will stun Sharkey as he comes in.
Whatever style they choose at the be
ginning of the fight, slugging will follow
to a certainty, and the man that first
reaches the spot at which he aims will
win. ____^_________

Will Be Given the Name
Hibernta.
Special IMspatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 25.â The Evening
Post says: There is a strong probability i
that tho next challenger for the Ameri- ;
caÃ cup â¢will be Major Eustace Jameson,
M. P. He Is a warm friend of Sir Thomas
Upton and witnessed tho races between j
the Shamrock and the Columbia.
Should Major Jameson challenge ,
he will have the Shamrock . for j
a trial horse. Anybody who challenges >
will be welcome to the yacht for such a
purpose, but Major Jameson would be )
particularly bo because of the friendship ;
existing between lie and Sir Thomas. The 1
Jameson boat would very probably be
built from a Watson design, and, It Is ;
said, would be built at Belfast, ex-Lord
Mayor Pirrie, the head of the firm of Har- ;
i lana & Wolff, being quitÂ© willing to un
dertake the work.
Even the name of the boat has been
discussed. Rnd while some of the mutual
friends of both the major and Sir Thomas
ware in favor of having it called Sham
rock, the most favored name was Hi- â 
bernta. Major Jameson might challenge
through the Kingstown Royal i acht
Club, but will probably send it, if at ail,
through either the Royal Ulsters or the
Royal Corks.
The crew of the yacht Shamrock to-day
continued at Erie basin the stowing away
of the racing gear and the preparation of
the yacht for her passage across the At

BASEBALL
SEASON ON
LAST LAP
Gossip and Notes of the Dia
mond Athletes â Sheridan
Will Umpire.
The series of games last week left the
four teams of the league in about ihe
same relative positions. Sacramento has
hold the first place in the column for so
lons that thefans are of a common opinion
that no change will be made this season.
This may be so, or It may not. An in
jection of a email dope of chance one. way
rr the other may force San Francisco up
to the top notch, and when the season is
over, at :he end of next month, the locals
may have the pennant. The fight between
Oakland and Santa Cruz for third place
Still continues. Ap they are but 2 per cent
apart In rank, for all practical pur
poses they may be said to be tied.
A curiosity of last week's games was
the even break. Each team won and lost
a game, and as only two games were
played on account of the rain Saturday
afternoon, the expected change In rank
ing did not happen. This week may bring
what half the fans are praying for, a
switching of positions by the first two
and by the last two teams. The standing
of the clubs is as follows:
John Sheridan, well known on Eastern
as well ns local diamonds aa an umpire of
undoubted ability, will he seen at Recrea
tion Park Saturday and Sunday afternoon
and Sunday morning on the Oakland
gnmnil?. He will be the arbiter on those
occasions.
In this city San Francisco and Santa
Cruz will cross bats for the afternoon
pame and In Oakland Sunday morning.
Oakland and Sacramento will play In the
capital.
Rig Bill Lange Is now a familiar figure
a loner the line, and many Interesting
things does he tell about Eastern baee
ball. In regard to first base men, the
league has quite a few erackerjarks, and
Lance says. In relation to the ambition of
local players to get into the big league,
that a pood player should not waste his
time at the first bag if he expects to play
In the National League. That position is
always filled by men who have become
gray' in the service, thoroughly experi
. and too slow for the faster work of
other positions.
It 1* a singular thing that Harper has
won but a single game, since he has r>ren
with Oakland, yet his pitching has been
of the llncst quality.
Ib'-rg and Sullivan are wanted by the
Kfistern managers and may soon be
signed.
Van Haltren and Donlin will soon be
seen in town.
Harris is on the kick because he di i
not get the game Saturday. The locals
had a blcr lead when the rain cut off the
game, which was called a draw.
A week from Sunday San Francisco nn~
Santa Cruz will play in Vallejo. the latter
team trying out the Vallejo battery. The
game will be a test as to the possibilities
of the town as a place for the playing of
league games next season.
BATHOS WILL
TAKE A LOT
OF BEATING
Bit of Fashion Beaten by the
Montana Coltâ Four Win-
ning Choices.
Bit of Fashion, the crack Eastern filly
owned by Burns & Waterhouse, again
cast a feeling of gloom over her admirers
and backers at Oakland yesterday. She
started once before at tho meeting and
her defeat on that particular occasion was
ascribed to lack of condition. Yesterday
in a three-cornered contest at seven fur
longs Bathos, tho Montana-bred colt,
showed his heels to the Easterner from
the start. In the first betting Princess
Zeika and Bit of Fashion opened equal
choices, with Bathos the outsider. So
much coin went in on the Burns & Water
house filly that the odds against the Prin
cess went to S to 5. The race developed a
surprise. To a pretty start Ruiz took the
lead with Bathos and, holding the colt
well together, won all the way, finishing
three lengths ahead of the two young
misses, which were lighting it out des
perately for the place. Thorpe, on the
favorite, had the best of the saddle ar
gument with Ward, winning by a neck.
Southern Girl, the stablemate of Bit of
Fashion and formerly considered her in
ferior, scored her second win in the six
furlong sprint for all ages. She had Sat
sunia to beat, and performed the feat
very creditably. An 11 to 20 favorite, th^
aged horse, nut at bis best anyway, could
nut get within hailing distance at the
close. The winner now looks to be the
better of this brace of high-priced horse
flesh, apparently being able to continue
on, after stepping the distance in 1:15 flat.
The racing card offered turf-goers had
more of a class twang to it than any yet
furnished during the season, and in conse
quence the attendance was large. Favor
ites were mure than fairly successful, cap
turing four of six purses.
Thorpe, astride Wilmeter, landed the
opening event, a cheap six furlong selling
dash, at odds of 4 to 1. He had his mount
in front from the jump, leading My Dear
past the stand three lengths. Shannon
ette nosÂ«d Alaska, the second choice, out
fÂ».r third place. _
Trainer "Butch" Fisher started Plan In
the six furlong run, third on the card, for
the first time this season. The chestnut's
price drifted fmm 6 to 5 to threes, and he
won like breaking sticks. Chihuahua
closed favorite, but blew up, after chas
ing out In the lead with Sybaris. T.
Walsh, astride Plan, went sightseeing at
tho stretch turn and then held his field
safe. Sybaris was second,, a neck before
Sal He Goodwin.
Barney Schrelber's colors were seen for
the first time on Forte, winner of the mile
and a sixteenth affair. The bay gelding
received HUbstantial support, closing a
pronounced choice, and coming through In
the stretch under Ward's clever handling,
downed Donator with considerable to
Rainier could not repeat, landing
in the show.
The 4 to 1 shot Montellade almost
created a flutter of excitement by his
showing in the closing mile run. He led
the field Into the stretch, but was gradu
ally overhauled and beaten out by the fa
vorite Rosinante. also piloted by Ward.
Show honors fell to Morlnel.
Track Notes.
St. Anthony was recently purchased
from E. Corrigan by "Frisco" Lind. Po
tente, another member of the Corrigan
string, Is now in the etable of Galen
Hr.iwn.
According to a telegram received at
Oakland yesterday, Fred Foster with a
stable of fourteen horses will leave Chi
cago for California next Monday. Yellow
tail and Peace are among the lot.
-idlng Judge Murphy rendered the
following ruling from the stand yester
day: For suspicious rides on Sorrow and
Katie Gibbons, Jockey McCloskey Is ruled
off the turf. On October IS Rio Chlco was
apparently not ridden to win by J. Brown,
finishing among the "also rans." Two
days later Brown again rode Rio Chico
and the sprinter was played for a good
thing, just being beaten the last few
jumps by Lodestar. Brown was also ruled
off. When Rainier was beaten by Festoso
on Tuesday Jockey Buchanan apparently
evinced no great desire to win, riding con
trary to orders. One or two previous ef
forts of the same rider looked none too
clean and be was likewise ruled off. \V.
Short and Leo Solomon were warned off
the Oakland track for making money
propositions to Jockey McCloskey. Short
told* McClosbey he would get a bet down
for him whenever that rider thought he
could win, and Judge Murphy contends
that a person who will do this is very apt
to make counter propositions. Leo Solo
mon was accused of the same offense.
The Honig stables were reinstated.

and won ultimately by a score of 21 to 12. j
The attendance was unusually large for [
midweek. The sport was of even quality
throughout, possessing little of a sensa
tional character. Geraldine beat McKin

AN OPEN LETTER.
San Francisco, Oct. 24, 1899.
To the Chairman, to the Secretary anc
to the Members or the Citizens Repub-
lican Convention:
Believe me, gentlemen, I thank you sin-
cerely for the recognition and Indorse-
ment I have received at your hands ir
nominating me as a candidate for re-
election to the , .â ,,-, of Police Judge o]
the city and county of San Francisco. ]
feel no tnnliiK gratification at the honoi
you have conferred upon me, and I assure
you that 1 feel most grateful to you an Â£
each and every one of you at the kint
and liberal manner in which I have beer
treated at your hands. One year ago yoi
honored me In the .same manner, and witr
your assistance and co-operation I hat
the honor of being elected Judge of this
great city. At that time, gentlemen, ]
promised you and the people or mis cltj
that if elected I would inaugurate thÂ«
following reforms: Firstâ That I woulc
not permit children to be incarcerated one
nut in the dock with criminals. Second-
That 1 would not suffer working men, me
cnanlcs or reputable citizens to be placet
In tho criminal dock when charged wltl
trivial offt rises, as it is wrong in princi-
pie and wrung in law. Thirdâ '.
would not issue or sustain search war-
rants against merchants, hotel or lodg
ing house keepers, as the Issuance o:
warrants in such eases Is not authorlzec
by law. Fourthâ I would protect the
orphan, the poor and the oppressed
Fifthâ I would protect all property
rights. Sixthâ That no man's nationality
belief or condition In life would inter
fen* with the just and lawful administra
tion of justice in my court.
Now, gentlemen, I feel proud to saj
that since my incumbency in office no boj
or woman has been placed in the doc>
with vagabonds or thieves, or otherwise
and as presiding Judge of the Police
Court, I have ordered that all boys ar
rested for trivial offenses be released a
the request of the mother, father oi
guardian of said children, as the jail 1;
not only damp, unhealthy and dangeroui
to the health of the children, but th<
Burroundings have a tendency to harder
and corrupt the mind of the youth. Ii
no instance have 1 convicted or held i
child to answer before the Superior Court
In the cases where the parents are repu
table and able to care for their childrer
I have pent them home to their parents
and 1 have always contended that th<
father or mother is the best judge of the
case. 1:. cases of orphansâ gtrls or boys-
or when girls or boys are truants. wh(
nre leading or apt to lead an lmmora
life, having no parents to control them
I have always sent them to our different
public Institutions, first regarding and re-
ppecting not only the moral but the spirit
ual teachings of the parents of the child
Gentlemen, without further comment, ]
will state that 1 have done all in mj
power to fulfill the promise that I ther
made, and it would be vanity on my pan
to further encroach upon your time by
extolling my own duties and making my-
self the hero of my own statements.
You who have watched my career arf
the best to judge as to whether or not ]
have fulfilled he duties of my office; but
the past is gone, it has been and It is
now time to speak and provide for the
future. Retrenchment and reform are
now become not only expedient for our
prosperity, but necessary to our very ex-
istence.
No man of sense can say that the pres-
ent system of municipal government
Fhould continue; and I assure you that
if re-elected you will have no cause to
regret for having tendered me this nomi-
nation. I will uphold the law. for in my
humhle position I am conscious of the
fact that there is a reward in store for
the man who thinks with Integrity and
aot>Â» with decision.
Gentlemen, I accept your nomination,
and 1 hereby present myself to the people
of this city as your candidate. They are
the judges, ana in their hands and hon-
est judgment I submit my candidacy.
Gentlemen, receive my most grateful ac-
knowledgment. Yours respectfully,
(Signed.) A. B. TREADWELL..
Judge of the Police Court.

Many a woman has periodic crying
â¢pells. She meets her husband with
eyes red and swollen and he cries out :
" What has happened ? " " Nothing" his
wife replies. " T don't know what is the
matter with me, but I just had to have
a good cry." Men don't have crying
spells. It would seem therefore that an
affection confined to women must have
its cause in the womanly nature. There
is no doubt that a diseased condition of
the delicate womanly organs, is in gen-
eral responsible for feminine nervous-
ness and hysteria.
The use of Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre-
scription makes women happy by mak-
ing them healthy. There are no more
crying spells. "Favorite Prescription"
cures inflammation, ulceration and fe-
male weakness. It makes weak women
strong, sick women well.
There is no medicine "just as good."
Accept no substitute.
" For three years," writes Mrs. Mary A. Sasser,
of High, Lamar Co., Texas, " I suffered with fall-
ing of the womb, also ulceration of the womb.
: After using three bottles of your ' Favorite Pre-
scription,' four of 'Golden Medical Discovery'
and two vials of ' Pleasant Pellets.' I found re-
lief. lam able to do my work with ease. I rec-
ommend your wonderful medidne to all my
friends, for I truly believe it saved my life." .

Baago deeded all his property over to his
wife and the couple separated. Baago
secured employment as a cabinet-maker
In San Francisco and his wife returned to
Sheep Island with the little girl. Tuesday
Hans Hansen, an aged dairyman resid
ing on the island, ate dinner with them.
Mrs. Baago expressed herself to him as
satisfied with the condition of affairs, but
Hansen thought she seemed down
hearted. In order to divert her mind
from her troubles Hansen suggested a
boat ride or a walk about the Island, and
Mrs. Baago consented to take a walk
and promised to meet him at the quarry,
some distance from the house. At about
3 o'clock, Mrs. Baago having failed to
appear, Hansen feeling worried, went to
the house to ascertain the cause of her
non-appearance. As he entered the
house he called for Mrs. Baago, and get
ting no response, he opened the door of
her bedroom. The sight that met his
gaze paralyzed him for the moment.
There upon the floor of the small bed
room lay the body Qf the little child liter
ally bathed in its own blood. The feet
of the body were almost against the door,
while the head was lying in the corner
close by with the bloody knife under it.
From all indications the mother had
called the child Into the room and with
out warning grabbed her by the
hair and with one strong stroke drew the
knife across the little glrl'B throat, com

A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
OBJECT TO AFTrLIATTON WITH
ANTI-SAXOON ÃBAGUE.
The second day's sessions of the Con
gregational California State Association
j churches convened at 8 o'clock yesterday
! morning in the First Church, Mason and
! Post streets, with the moderator, Rev. W.
W. Scudder of Alameda. in the chair.
The morning session was largely devoted
Ito the business of the association. After
! devotional exercises Rev. W. W. Cross of
I Saratoga was called to the chair and the
! moderator proceeded to read the report
I of the National Council committee relat
ing to the federation of missionary socie
ties. The report of the committee, which
i favored the Copperi plan, was approved.
The report of the committee on tem
perance was presented by Rev. J. R.
| Knodell, who declared that the work al
i ready done had but aroused the enemy,
I and he urged the necessity of continuing
j the struggle with renewed energy. With
this end In view, he presented the follow
| Ing resolution prepared by the commlt-
I teÂ»Â», which he asked the association to
j adopt:
I That the preachers in all the churches make
; thiÃ a special theme for work; thai the edlt.r
! of The Pacific continue to take his present high
! stand upon this question; that we rt-cognixe In
i the W. C. T. U. a worthy helper In temperance
reform and give it our hearty Indorsement:
' that we will elect four delegates to the annual
I meeting of the Anti-Saloon league, which Is
to be held in Oakland In November; that we
reafllrni onr confidence in the Anti-Salonn
League and recommend the incorporation of
, ; Its work in the churches by the organization
i of local leagues; and that we call upon the
: churches all over the State to elect such men
i to the Legislature of 1900 na will stand by the
temperance legislation now in foree â namely,
j the county government law. the law restrain-
I ing Baloons In cities and towns and the sanitary
district law.
Rev. C. R. Brown of Oakland opposed
the proposition to organize leagues In the
churches as proposed by the resolutions.
i He declared that the Anti-Saloon League
j was a political body, and as such had no
' place in the church. Dr. Knodell made an
| address touching upon the work of the
i Anti-Saloon League and then a motion
to refer the report of the committee on
temperance was lost, the matter being
made a special order for 9 o'clock this
morning.
The narrative of the churches, prepared
by Rev. E. S. Williams, was read by Rev.
George B. Hatch of Berkeley.
The following recommendations were
made by the committee on nominations,

Rev. Dr. A. Drachms, chaplain at San

i with an interesting paper on "Arbltra
l tion," in which he advocated the estab
! llshment of a permanent International
j court to arbitrate the differences arising
! between nations.
In the afternoon Rev. R. H. Sink of
1 Stockton, assistant moderator, presided.
j Rev. Dr. S. H. "W'illey of this city read

GUARDING AMERICAN
INTERESTS IN SAMOA
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.â Until further
Informed of the attitude of Great Britain
on the German proposition to partition
the Samoan Islands among the three
powers signatory to the Berlin treaty,
it is probable that Secretary Hay will not
make a categorical reply. Final action
certainly will not be taken by this Gov
ernmc-nt until the President and Secre
tary of State understands the views of
influential Senators with reference to the
proposed disposition of the islands.
In the meantime there Is no Intention
on the part of the administration to be
pushed into hasty action by rumors of
trouble in Samoa and the report emanat
ing from German sources that for the
surrender of her rights In the islands of
Tutulla and Savaii Germany should be
given possession of Upolu and additional
compensation.
It was significantly stated to-day that
the President proposrd to oarf fully" guard
every Interest of the United States in
Tutuila in view of American possession
of the harbor of Pago Pago on that Isl
and by this Government, and to require
adequate compensation for the surrender
of American claims to the islands of
Upolu and Savaii.
The authorities have determined that
there shall be no additional commission
appointed to settle the Samoan question,
but the matter will be ended by direct
negotiations between the three Govern
ments. It is apparent that these negotia
tions will consume several months, and
as a preliminary to them it may be de
cided to pnt into force some of the rec
ommendations of the Joint High Commis
sion, which some months ago Investi
gated the conditions prevailing In the
Islands.

pletely decapitating her. After throwing
the knife away she threw the head upon
the floor, and., leaving the house, ended
hen own life by Jumping into the bay.
That the woman was insane is a cer
tainty, as she was often heard saying
that she was tired of the kind of life
she w&s living and would make away
with the child and then drown herself,
and the latter is the theory held by the
officers as to her whereabouts.
Word was sent to Coroner Curry at
Martinez about 3 o'clock In the afternoon
and he, accompanied by Deputy Sheriff
Johnson, hastened to the scene of the
murder. The Coroner and deputy sheriff
searched the island thoroughly and no
trace of the missing woman could be
found. She left the following note, writ
ten In Danish:
"Goodby, Hansen. I cannot Btand it
any longer. My husband has been bother
ing me for the last ten years. Hansen
and Anderson can sell the cows and di
vide It, and the house can you sell and
divide in three partsâ my sister Jine one
part, my brother Pete one part and my
husband'B sister Sine her part. My best
regards. MARIA BAAGO.
"Now can papa enjoy himself? I take
my girl with me."
The remains of the child were taken to
San Pablo, where they were viewed by
the Coroner's jury, after which they were
taken to Martinez on a late train. The
inquest will be held to-morrow after
noon, In San Pablo. Coroner Curry was
Interviewed and said:
"It is one of the saddest cases It has
been my duty to handle for the past ten
years, during which time I have been
AGUINALDO SENDS
PEACE PROPOSALS
Accredits an Agent to
Washington.
Ppecial IMspatch to The CaJl.
NEW YORK, Oct. 25.â A special to the
World from Washington says: Senor An
tonio Regidor, now In London, will sail
for the United States within three weeks,
! and as a fully accredited representative of
! Aguinaldo, wLll present to President Mc-
Kinley new terms for ending hostilities
| and reconstructing the government of the
| islands. The coming of the representative
Is kept a close secret by the administra
tion, but from a high authority the World
correspondent learns that these are the
exact terms Aguinaldo desires:
1. Absolute free trade betweÂ«n the United
! States and the Philippine Islands, carrying
I with It the fullest commercial favor between
i the two countries.
2. Perfect religious freedom, as now exists
under the government of Aguinaldo, the same
being a concession made by him to the wishes
of the United States.
3. Coaling stations for the United States
upon all Important Islands of the archipelago,
to be selected by the United States and ceded
outright forever by the Filipinos. This would
Include Manila.
4. Military reservations at Manila, Hollo,
Panay, Mlndora. Negro*, Mashate. Samar,
Mindanao and such other islands as may be de
termined upon by both Governments.
5. The employment of United States officials
In thÂ« customs and all other lntprnal branches
of the Government, to be selected by the
I I -lltod States and paid by the Filipino Gov
ernment.
8. The introduction of the American police
system.
7. The establishment of a Judiciary as now
I exists <">n the Island nt Cuba.
S. The reconstruction of the entire Filipino
Government upon lines as nearly consistent
as possible with those prescribed by the con
stitution of the United States and adanted to
the requirements of the natives.
9. Recognition of the Filipino Government
aa an independent republic under a protec
torate of the United States.
Senor Regidor will have plenipotentiary
powers to treat with the United States
Government upon all of these points in
order to reach an agreement by which
hostilities may cease.
Sennr Regidor will be the most im
portant political emissary ever sent to the
Tnited States by the Filipinos. He will
have more power than Agonclllo, who was
summarily driven out of Washington
after presenting a memorial to Congress,
which was notable alone for Its indiscreet
attack upon the United States. Senor
Regidor will represent Aguinaldo himself.
Regidor is said to be a man of great
ability and learning, having had long ex
| perlence in European diplomatic circles.
The Filipino Government has had no
representation here since the banishment
of Agonoillo. But the administration has
been fully informed of the demands of
Aguinaldo and his advisers through the
dispatches of General Otis and the secret
| service maintained by this Government
in Europe.

Coroner of Contra Costa County. I was
summoned to-day to come to Sheep Isl
and with all possible haste and accord
ingly went to San Pablo and there secur
ed a rowboat and went to the Island, ac
companied by Deputy Sheriff Fred John-
6on.
"We were met by the farmhand, Han
sen, who conducted us to the house.
There, In a room, upon the floor, lay the
body of a 10-year-old girl, with her head
severed completely from the trunk. I
found a letter left by Mrs. Baago. written
In Danish. We made a thorough search of
the Island for the mlssingwoman, but were
unable to find any trace whatever of her.
It is my opinion that she has committed
suicide by drowning herself. The island
is a dreary place and Is occupied by no
one except the Baago family, Hansen and
a fisherman. It is my impression the
woman brooded over the trouble with her
husband and became temporarily insane.
I brought the remains of the little girl to
San Pablo, where they were viewed by a
jury. I will hold an inquest next Friday
afternoon."
Deputy Sheriff Fred Johnson was seen
to-night, and he has the following to say:
"I was summoned to Sheep Island to-day
from Martinez, and witnessed one of the
saddest cases I have ever seen In my life.
Coroner Curry and I rowed to the island
and upon learning full particulars of the
case from the man Hansen I set about
making a thorough search of the entire
island. I visited every nook and corner
and could find no trace of the missing
woman I am morally certain she has
committed suicide by drowning."
ADJOURNMENT OF
TEMPERANCE UNION
Place of Next Meeting
Not Yet Chosen.
Special rÂ»Bpatch to Tha Call.
SEATTLE, Oct. 25.â The National Wo
man's Christian Temperance Union closed
i Its twenty-sixth annual convention and
silver jubilee In this city to-day and to
morrow will witness the departure of a
larpe number of the delegates for the
East. Some will remain on the Pacific
Coast visiting friends and relatives and
a number will go from here to Southern
California.
The excitement over the denunciatory
resolutions on the national administra
tion's policy in the Philippines and on the
interpellation of the "anti-canteen law,"
passed yesterday, had not died out when
to-day's meeting convened. Many dele
gates insist that the union made a seri
ous mistake in condemning the adminis
tration. A high officer, in an authorized
interview to-day, while refusing to al
low her name to be used, said: "The
union made the mistake of its life in
passing the resolution. In order to further
our temperance work we have much to
ask of the administration and our re
quests will have but little weight when
by our minutes we show that we have no
faith in President McKlnley and the other
official heads of our Government. The
union will live to regret yesterday's
work."
Throughout the session to-day nothing
was said about yesterday's resolutions.
Mrs. Hannah J. Bailey of Maine, superin
tendent of the peace and International
arbitration department, under the aus
pices of which the Philippine war resolu
tion was Introduced, read her report. The
on.y reference made to the criticisms by
her committee was when she said: "We
do not criticisp the soldiers who from a
sense of apprehended duty and so-called
patriotism enlist."
Miss Mary C. Brehn of Illinois, super
intendent of the department of franchises,
read her report.
After a number of local addresses had
been delivered the afternoon meeting ad
journed.
The executive committee, to whom had
been referred the matter of selecting next
year's meeting place, me* to-night, out
made no selection. It will meet again to
morrow and there is every indication that
Indianapolis, Ind., will be named.
IN NEXT STJNDAY'S CALL

Miss Krnger is a niece of
Oom Paul Krug-er and recently
came to San Francisco to be

GRAERE DIVORCE GRANTED.
Grounds Were Cruelty and Too Much
Mother-in-Law.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 25.-Mrs. Mary Grae.be
was to-day granted a divorce from
Charles E. Graebe. the well-known jew
eler, by Judge Hyland. The ground was
cruelty, and Graebe did not appear In
court to dispute the charge. Graebe is
one of the most popular young business
men in the county. Two years ago he met
his wife while she was here on a visit
She returned to her home in Philadelphia'
and a few weeks later he followed her'
They were married and returned here A
pretty cottage was furnished, but 'the
honeymoon was shortlived, and ten days
after their arrival home Mrs Graebe
picked her trunk and teft her husband
Graebe s mother and sister went to live
with him, and the young wife declares he
lost all affection for her and would hard
ly sprak to her. She blames her mother
in-law for this lack of attention Mrs
Graebe is now residing with her brother
in Oakland. A satisfactory settlement of
the property has been made.

INVESTIGATING THE
FULLER WILL SCANDAL
Three Prominent Citizens Arrested on
Charges of Perjury and
Forgery.
CHICO. Oct. 25.â At last some action
has been taken In the notorious will con
test In the Alfred Fuller estate. The full
history of this alleged will was given in
The Call some time last summer and, as
was then predicted and intimated, that
sooner or later the principals to the will
would find themselves in deep water. The
will over which so much comment has
been made was In favor of Mrs. Minnie
Houseworth, Dr. J. E. Rodley and John
Garner being the witnesses. This will
was hatched up some time after the
death of Alfred Fuller, who was nevpr
married, and much comment was made
when the same was offered for probate.
The Grand Jury has had the matter un
der consideration for thÂ« past two weeks.
subpenaJng many of the most prominent
citizens from Chico before It.
This afternoon Indictments were issued
for J. E. Rodley, John Garner and Mrs.
Minnie Houweworth. Garner and Rodley
were arrested here, while Mrs. House
worth was arrested in San Francisco.
The charge against them is forgery and
perjury. Unusual interest is taken in the
case because of the prominence of the
accused. J. E. Rodley was for the past
two years Mayor of Chico and is one of

might even deprive him of renomination for the
Presidency.
The Republicans of the State have not evaded the
issue. They have been perfectly willing there as else
where to meet the Bryanites on any ground the lat
ent choose. They have had no objections to
the introduction of national politics into a State cam
nor do they shrink from a contest against the
Nebraska candidate for the Presidency. They have
entered upon a vigorous campaign and have pushed
the iusionists so hard that Bryar. himself has found
it necessary to return from his campaigning in other

ABOUT STRAIGHT TICKETS.
\A R. BRITTON is being somewhat overworked
; / V in the Democratic campaign. The Mayor j
* * started out by assuming personal responsi
: bihty for denouncing Horace Davis as a traitor and
the Republican party for treason to the charter.
When it seemed necessary to the personal comfort :
of Mr. Britton to make him feel at home in his de- ,
sertion to the Democracy Mr. Phelan hit upon the
plan of using him as a witness against the Republican j
party. So, in the Thirty-ninth Assembly District, j
j Mr. Phelan said: "I will not say Republicans are j
antagonistic to the charter, but Mr. Britton is a man
ot honor and he says so." He puts Mr. Britton in '
the position of turning State's evidence and uses him
in that capacity. It was a saying of Burr that
passed into an axiom at the bar that "the meanest
| rascal always turns State's evidence." If Mr. Phelan
choose to put Mr. Britton in that position it is his
affair, not ours. Mr. Britton suffered himself to be
nominated as a Republican candidate for Supervisor, ;
! and after waiting until effect would be given to his j
declination and announcement of his support of
Phelan he did both.
Now Mr. Phelan in every speech praises Britton j
as the "grand old man," but abuses the Republican |
party, which desired to put this grand old person on J
the Board of Supervisors. If Mr. Britton is really the ,
virgin personality described by Mr. Phelan, nothing !
is proved except the desire of the Republican party j
to nominate men of that kind when they chose him.
It goes without, saying that any other nominee of j
the Republican party who -will join Mr. Phelan in;
imploring Democrats to vote their ticket straight j
Â«md Republicans to bolt theirs will receive the same j
ascription of purity and high character that is be- i
stowed on Mr. Britton. But all this would be only
additional prom' that the Republican party was ac
tu.tted by no other purpose than the nomination of
men who would best serve the people by the faultless |
administration of the charter and the law.
There would be much merit in Mr. Phelan's pro
fession to Republicans of non-partisanship if Mr. j
Britton had remained on the Republican ticket and
Mr. Phelan had daily and nightly eulogized him and ;
j asked people to vote for him. Mr. Britton was
| neither more nor less a grand old man when the Re- >
I publicans nominated him than he is now. But the j
: Phelan vision was never clarified to his merits until
ihe joined the Phelan standard. The Republicans are j
| now accused of treason to the charter. Did they
: show it when they nominated Britton? The fact is i
! that in making up their ticket the Republicans [
i sought and found candidates supposed to be just
such good citizens as Mr. Phelan describes Britton :o
be and nominated him among the rest in a con
genial company. That he chose to desert it is his
affair. His former associates have seen no reason to
i alter their estimate of him, except such reason as !
Mr. Phelan has supplied by declaring it would have j
j been treason to the charter to have voted for him a3
j a Republican candidate for Supervisor.
The other Republican candidates chosen as Mr.
: Britton was. and for the same reasons, and with the :
same unbroken purpose, are just as worthy as he
! was, no more, no less. If he or Mr. Phelan can give i
; tn Republicans a reason for bolting the ticket of a j
j convention that was modeled upon the exact char- ;
i acter now ascribed to Britton by Phelan, we would
like to hear it.
Clinton R. Breckinridge, who is credited with a
knowledge of statecraft, believes that the United
States should go to England's assistance in the event
o! a Continental combination against the British.
People who know less about statecraft but possibly
more of the eternal fitness of things than Breckin
ridge believe that Uncle Sam ought to mind his own
WATER STORAGE.
THE Escondido Times, organ of Federal irriga
tion, has discovered "a literary bureau" in San
Francisco which fulminates in opposition to its
views on water storage. It has also nominated and
elected Mr. John P. Irish the leader of that opposi
tion and proceeds to souse him in ilood waters and
other, in a baptism that ought to drown him or make
him stay good. It may be necessary to say that the
men who know that our flood waters belong to the
State of California, are its property and asset, are
not particularly in need of the leadership of Mr.
Irish or anybody else. They have called a convention
for November 14 to consult upon the best way to se
â  cure the use of this State property which is now run
! ning to waste. In spite of any aqueous argument made
: by Mr. Irish, they are entirely willing that any com
| monwealth in possession of a similar property and
asset shall give it to the United States or throw it at
birds. Indeed the convention may conclude that
California should do one or the other with it. But
it is an existing property; it belongs to the State,
i and only the State can dispose of it. It is assumed
â  at the outset that the Irrigation Congress at Mis
soula has the right to dispose of this property, and
that its conclusions of policy are proper and indis
putable. Still as a matter of law the United States
cannot enter the State of California, take possession
of its property, control and distribute it, without the
consent of the State. The Irrigation Congress is
admitted to be a very able body and very representa
tive, but it is a voluntary organization, has no statu
tory existence, is not a legal entity. It can consult
and advise and use its American right to pass reso
lutions, but it cannot pass laws nor alienate the
property of a State without the State's consent.
Perhaps the Times will agree that the convention
of November 14. as a State affair, may be usefully in
formed of the Federal irrigation, and perhaps may be
successfully importuned to adopt it, and induced to
advise the next Legislature to turn its asset in the
' flood water over to the United States.
It is to be regretted that Mr. Irish's tendency to
epigram has caused excitement by being taken as the
statement of an inflexible policy.
The Times mistakenly says that "the promoters of
the State scheme seem to start out with the idea that
the first thing necessary- to be done is to kill off the
rational movement." This is a misapprehension en
tirely. The promoters of this convention don't wish
to kill anything, but to make all alive. The killing
it leaves to the drought, to the forest fires, to the
Fabian policy of waiting for the distant god* to hear
ovr prayer for fruitfulness of our fields while the
means to make it run to waste down our mountain
sides. If the national irrigationists would cease their
uneasy and tormenting suspicions, which impeach the
motives of people who are hand in hand with them
in pursuit of the same object, and, dismounting from
their national high horse, would sit down and talk
it over like reasonable men. the situation would lose
thÂ«! friction for which they alone are responsible.
The situation is that millions of dollars of property
belonging to the State are running to waste every
year. We all want to know how best and quickest to
save it. By getting together in the coming conven-
Btion a way may be found to that end.
is no use of using Mr. Irish as a scarecrow.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1899.
He and General Otis of Los Angeles can be staked
off together, and then we can all trust to the ability
of General Otis to give that soft answer that turneth
away wrath to conquer any unruliness.
The British Colonial Office has received advices
from South Africa that the Basutos are listening to
overtures from the Boers. That being the case, the
world will probably learn within a very short time
whether or not there is any truth in the. saying that

W. R. WHEELER FOR COMMISSIONER.
SOMETHING more than ordinary gratification
is to be found in the manner with which the
Pacific Coast jobbers and manufacturers have
entered upon the task of guarding the interests of
the coast in matters of transportation. There has
been a cordial co-operation among the people of all
the coast States, and every step thus far taken has
been with the approval of their representatives.
The conference in this cjty, which was attended
by delegates from Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Los
Angeles, Sacramento and Marysville, as well as from
San Francisco, has formulated a wisely devised
course of action, and has, furthermore, unanimously
agreed upon a candidate to be recommended to the
President for appointment to the vacancy on the In
terstate Commerce Commission. The accomplish
ment of that much augurs well for the ultimate suc
cess of the whole movement, inasmuch as it assures
a continuance of that combined and harmonious
energy which has brought about the good results
thus far attained.
The candidate selected for the office, W. R.
Wheeler of this city, is an ideal man for the posi
tion. While the delegates from the various States
were in session a dispatch was received from the
Portland Chamber of Commerce urging them to
agree upon a business man as the candidate of the
coast for the conimissionership. The request has
been fully complied with. Mr. Wheeler is a business
man in the strictest, in the fullest and in the best
sense of the word. He is familiar with the business
of the coast and understands its needs. He has the
nbi'.ity and has had the training necessary to enable
him to apply his knowledge to the greatest advantage
in the transaction of affairs, and if appointed to the
commission will soon be noted as one of the most
useful and efficient of its members.
It is to be noted that the consideratipn of freight
rates and other questions of transportation affecting
the interests of the Pacific Coast has long engaged
the attention and the study of Mr. Wheeler, and the
work expected of him it appointed to the commission
will not find him unprepared. He has repeatedly
appeared as a representative of Pacific Coast
merchants when coast rates were under consid
eration before the representatives of the trans
continental railroads. It was the high reputation
which he has won in that way as an advocate and
supporter of the rights of the coast that inclined the
conference to Mr. Wheeler and won for him the
honor of the unanimous recommendation for the
office.
We have now the plan of campaign and the leader.
The rest is for the representative men and organiza
tions of our merchants and manufacturers to do.
There should go from every important point on ths
Pacific Coast strong indorsements of the request for
the appointment of Mr. Wheeler. The issue, as we
have repeatedly pointed out, is one that affects almost
every industry and interest of the three States. Cali
fornia, Oregon and Washington have in this matter
identical interests. It is full time that this coast had
a representative on the Interstate Commerce Com
mission, and now that a man in every respect fitted
to fulfill the duties of the office has been named for
it. there ought to be strong, vigorous and unanimous
support given to him by ail the influential forces
among our people.
The enthusiastic supporters of Mayor Phelan are
now dubbing him "the little giant" of San Francisco.
His Honor's claqueurs evidently forget what hap
pened to another Democratic "little giant" in the last
State campaign.
ONE of the noted events of the week in San
Francisco will be the thirty-first anniversary
and reunion of the Ancient Order of United
Workmen, which is to occur on Friday evening.
The occasion will serve to recall to public attention
the vast benefits to modern society which have re
srited from the work of those fraternal associations
of which the A. O. U. W. was the pioneer.
The order has in California 267 lodges in addition
to the Grand Lodge, and fifty-three Degree of Honor
lodges, to which women are admitted, and through
which they are made sharers in the benefits of the
association. The membership in the State is about
21,000. According to recently published statistics the
order had at the close of last year 360.096 members
and the total amount paid out up to that time to the
beneficiaries of the society was $88,400,820.
So vast a sum paid out during the thirty-one years
of its history by a single fraternal association shows
in a striking manner the immense benefit which can
be accomplished by mutual helpfulness. No one can
calculate the amount of good that has resulted from
the work of this and the kindred organizations which
have followed it. It must be borne in mind that the
various sums which go to make up the great total
have been in every case expended just where and
when they were needed to save the widow or the
orphan from suffering the privations and the dis
tresses of poverty. Not a cent of it has been given
in that kind of cold charity that humiliates the re
cipient. It has been merited because it has been
can-cd for his family by some member of the asso
ciation, who by helping others has won the right to
have help for his own when he in his turn has been
taken from them.
It is gratifying to note the flourishing conditions of
such associations in California. It has been largely
I through them that a system of mutual helpfulness on
j a vast scale has been built up among a people who
coming not only from all parts of the Union but from
all parts of the world might otherwise have had but
j little of that fraternal spirit which is essential to the
welfare of a community. The Ancient Order of United
Workmen can with just pride review the achieve
' monts of the past years and make their reunion an
occasion of genuine rejoicing and mutual congratula
tions.
The wish of Midas seems to have been granted in
the Alaskan gold fields. If the returning miners
could eat gold they might be able to live to tell the
story that death forces to remain untold.
Actual war has demonstrated the fact that the au
tomobile will never wholly supersede the horse. Just
think of a starving army eating its automobiles!
If the people of San Francisco could only see
Democratic candidates as they see themselves the
era of the truly good would begin.
THE UNITED WORKMEN.
W. J. BRYAN'S AWKWARD POSITION.
(Santa Rosa Republican.)
The San Francisco Call publishes what purports to be the fac-simile of a letter
Written June 11, 1883. by William J. Bryan to J. Sterling Morgan, both men being
residents of .X' hraska. Mr. Bryan was at that time a candidate for secretary of
the Railroad Commission of his State. He is accused of writing to Mr. Morton, "I
assure you that it is the money that is in the office and not the honor that attracts mo."
The letter appears to be genuine in every respect, and Mr. Morton, who is said
to have received it, was Secretary of Agriculture under President Cleveland. It is
a very remarkable declaration to come from a man who has received the consid
eration that has been shown Mr. Bryan. The Call gives the letter all possible
m prominence and vouches for its authenticity.
â¢ * â¦
(Los Angeles Times.)
Colonel William Jennings Bryan Is in trouble. In the year 1889 Mr. Bryan
wrote to the Hon. J. Sterling Morton that ho wanted the office of secretary of the
Railroad Commission In Nebraska, saying, "It Is the money that is In the office
and not the honor that attracts me." In September, IS9P, Mr. Bryan said to a
newspaper reporter that he had never said he wanted office for the money there
was in it and not for the honor. And now a letter in fac-simile. written with
Mr. Bryan's own hand, has been made public, showing that the Nebraska
man and tin soldier actually did write such a letter to the Hon. J. Sterling
Morton on January 11, 1889. Just how Colonel Bryan proposes to gret out of this
hole into which he has placed himself remains to be seen. It Is not Improbable
however, that this letter may have something to do with the removal of Mr. Bryan
from the position of an all-the-year-round, year-in-and-year-out Presidential can
didate.

UNIQUE FIRE DEPARTMENT, CONSTANTINOPLE
OF all the queer things to be found in Constantinople none seems so stupid
as the flre engines, if they can be called by so big a name. The houses in
that city are almost all built of wood, and If a fire does start it burns fast
and fiercely. There Is a constant watch kept on the summit of the old
Genoese tower in Galata, on the tall tower of the Seraskierat in Stamboul
and on a hill behind Candlli, one of the suburbs. From this last place a
cannon is fired to give warning of a fire, and when this takes place the watch
men of the city knock on the shutters of all the houses, crying, "There is a fire
In such and such a quarter." And then the fire department comes running down
the street. It consists of a long barrel, carried on the shoulders of half a dozen
men. Arrived at the scene of the fire, there is tremendous confusion. All the fire
men get in one another's way, and perhaps in the course of an hour a few feeble
handpumps are playing gentle streams of water somewhere In the neighborhood
of the burning buildings, if the fire has not burned itself out by that time. So
far there is no case on record of one having been quenched by this funny bri
gade.âSt. Louis Republic.

Cal. St. Cecilia is the patroness of mu
sic. It is recorded that she suffered i
martyrdom In 230. Her heathen parents
who are said to have belonged to a no
ble Roman family, betrothed their daugh
ter, who had become converted to Christ
ianity, to a heathen youth named Vale
rian. This youth and his brother Tibe
rius became Christian converts and suf
fered martyrdom also. Chaucer in "The
Secunde Nonnes* Tale" has it that one
day she told Valerian that an angt-1
"whether she was awake or asleep was
ever beside her." Valerian ret.
see this angel, and she said he must be
baptized first. Valerian was baptized and
suffered martyrdom. When Cecilia was
brought before the prefect Almachius and
refused to worship the Roman deities she
was "shut fast in a bath kept hot both
night and day with great fires." but "felt
of It no woe." Almachius then sent an I
executioner to cut off her head, but tor
no manner of chance could he smite her
fair neck in two." Three days she lin
Â«K4 with her neck bleeding preaching
Christ and Him crucihed all the wnile;
fhen she died and Pope : Urban buried the
body. As early as the hfth century theie
is mention of a church dedicated to her
at Rome, and in 82 1 . by order of Pope
Paschal her bones were deposited there.
St. Cecilia is regarded as the Jnventor oÂ£
the organ, and in the Roman Cat hoi c
church her festival day. November 22 is
celebrated with splendid music. Raphael,
Domenichtno, Dolce and others ha\e rep

NEW ZEALAND AFTER
FAST MAIL SERVICE
COLONIAL GOVERNMENT TO
GRANT SUBSIDIES.
Oceanic Company Offers to Put on a
Fast Line of Steamers Under
Certain Conditions.
Secretary Scott of the Chamber of Com
merce is in receipt of a communication
from The Hon. J. H. Witherford of New
Zealand Bhowing * liat great efforts are
being made in that country to rfecure
Government aid in the matter of grant
ing- subsidies to steamship companies to
carry fast mail across the Pacific. It is
very likely that the movement will be
taken up in the United States upon the
reassembling of Congress, many people
on this coast being deeply interested. In
New Zealand tho business community is
alive to the importance of improving the
lnterocean mail service, but the high offi
cials are either Blow or favor the Suez
route, as sWwn by the following letter
frum Mr. Witherford to Secretary Scott:
As active efforts have been made to improve
mail service which rivals the San Francisco
line, I have during the past month been work-
Ing hard to get the service to your port estab
lished first, as the premier route for a fixed
term of years, believing such In the future
will be mutually advantageous to New Zealand
and San Francisco. I will send you a copy
at what I have done for jrour perusal. Owing
to strong conflicting interests, it has been dif
ficult to get the Premier and members of the
Houae to consider the question in its true
light, as being a necessary auxiliary to the
extension of commercial relations between
America and the Colonies.
In the letter Mr. Witherford includes ex
tracts from the Observer of New Zealand,
which in part says:
J. H. "Witherford, who has been to great pains
to get things as far forward as possible, has
- i far successful that it only remains for
New Zealand to agree to the preliminaries an 1
the service can be in working order in time
for the Paris exhibition. John D. Spreckels,
whose ramifications of trade are gradually
spreading over so many parts of this hemis
phere, is at the head of the Oceanic Company
in San Francisco and his proposal, provided
he can get a subsidy from New Zealand and
Australia, is to put on a line of fast mall
Bttamers, fitted up in every way as luxuriously
as the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient
liners.
The service will be every twenty-one days,
and the time of the passage will be reduced
to a minimum. If carried out, not only Auck
land but all New Zealand will be immeasur
ably benefited by the scheme. There is bound
to be a larze increase of tourist traffic and
the commencement of the opening up of a
great trade between this colony and the United
States.
11 r. Spreckels very naturally requires that
if the line be subsidized it shall be for a
period of seven years. It Ftands to reason.
that no company will go to the enormous ex
pense of putting on a line of fast mail steam
ers without some guarantee as regards time,
and seven years is a comparatively short time
to ask for.

Away Last Night.
There is now a little more room at the
: Government wharf and Captain Barneson
:is correspondingly thankful. Two of
j the transports got away last night.
i Three others are In the stream. Thu
Olympia and Pennsylvania were the- first
jto get away. They are going to the Co
; lumbia River and will take a regiment of
soldiers aboard at Portland. The Tartar
and Newport were the next to k-ave. They
carry the Twenty-eighth Regiment be
twten them and will go to Manila, via
Honolulu. The Manauense was not many
I mjnutcs behind the Newport and Tartar.
j She carries four companies of the Thirty
! first, under command of Major Portf-r.
The Pennsylvania and City of Peking
have been turned into model troopships.
Under the direction of Supervising Engi
ueer J. H. Uatthewa all the inside cabin
work of the Pennsylvania on the main
deck was torn out and the vessel fitted
throughout with the Turner patent bunk.
I By this arrangement the transport can
j carry 300 more men and still the soldiers j
| have better quarters in every respect. ,
Thf-re is plenty of ventilation on the
I transport now and the men have room j
| to move about between the tiers of bunks, i
; With the spring mattresses there Is no
sagging as there was with the old can
v;is affairs, and everything can be kept i
I as clean as a new pin.
The Indiana was fitted out in the same ;

that he is going to fit out the Ohio in the j
same manner vhen she arrives.

ana will leave for Australia next Wednes
day with every inch of space on her occu
pled. She cannot carry all the freight
offering and many of the passengers will
have to sleep on settees, as all the bertha
were taken several days ago. Not an
ounce or" cargo is being taken for Hono
lulu, as the regular steamer will attend
to that. There is over llCn.i tons of canned
goods in the Moana's freight. There will
be no race to Honolulu between the
I Oceanic boat and the Hongkong Maru.
No coal can be got at Honolulu and the
Moana has only enough to take her to
Australia. None of the black diamonds
will go up in smoke in any racing on this
occasion, therefore.
The Diamond freight and express line,
successors' to the Davie Freight and Ex
press Company, ia doing remarkably well
on the Oakland run. The Mount Eden is
a good boat, but she is not large enough
for the business, so the company has
about completed arrangements fo/ the
building of a new and fast steamer for the
| creek route. In the meantime, if a good
! boat to run in conjunction with the Mount
I Eden can be got she will be put on the
opposition iii,.- to the Southern Pacific.

(Concluded. >
Critical Study of the Play.
Andrew Lang somewhere says:
" 'Love's Labor's Lost' ought to form a
part of compulsory education in schools,
colleges and newspaper offices." I should
be loth to subscribe to this opinion, for
the story of the play is of the slightest,
there is no plot to speak of. and wastes
of barren but intricate verbiage tempt
the understanding which they baffle and
mock. Yet he is right in recognizing its
Value as a satire on the euphuism and
preciosity which we have ever with us.
which begins with the sophomoric age
or earlier, but often continues to be the
product of riper years. It were needless
to multiply instancesâ Shakespeare him
self could furnish manyâ but here is one
from a writer who, In Holofernes' phrase,
draweth out the thread of his verbosity
finer than the staple of his argument; it
is from an essay of Swinburne's on the
dramatist Chapman, and the sense of it
might be applied to
our play: "There I
are beauties enough I
lost in this thick I
and thorny jungle of I
scholastic sensuality I
to furnish forth a I
ctbzen or so of I
pilfering poeticules I
, with abundance of I
1 purple patches to be I
| eewn on at intervals I
i to the common texÂ» I
ture of their style." I
This c h aracteristic I
of the play, the ob- I
scurity and artifici- I
J ality of the diction, I
! together with the I
I lack of movement, I
â¢ have prevented it I
I from ever regaining I
i the vogue upon the I
j stage which it en- I
! joyed within the I
first decade of its I
existence. In our I
own century it was I
| invested with great I
| splendor and placed I
! upon the boards of I
| Covent Garden in I
183S, but only to fall I
lifeless; and another
attempt at Sadlers
Wells in 1857 was no
more successful. As
an acting play it is
dead. As a closet drama It still appeals
to our interest in several ways.
In the first place, It is probably
the earliest play that Shakespeare wrote.
Critics dispute whether it was produced
in 1589, 1591, or a little earlier or later
than these dates. If 1589 be correct,
Shakespeare was 25 years of age. How
fascinating is the spectacle of the dra
matist trying his 'prentice hand at the
form of literature in which he was to
surpass any writer who ever lived. He
had married seven years before, and had
now been in London three years. There
had not been time for him to forget the
Latin which he had conned at the Strat
ford grammar school, nor the master un
der whom he had learned it. The rus
tics of the countryside appear as Ja
quenetta. Costard and Dull, while the cu
rate and pedagogue who had amused his
boyish years are condemned to an im
mortality of ridicule as Sir Nathaniel
and Holofernes. Shakespeare had not
been so long away that he could not re
member every rural sceneâ how It was
"when daisies pied and violets blue
â¢ â¢ * do paint the meadows with de
light," "when shepherds pipe on oaten
straws and merry larks are plowmen's
clocks," or, on the other hand,
"When icicles ham? by the wall,
And Dick the shepherd blow? hie nail,
And Tern bears logs into the hall,
And milk comes frozen home in pall."
To him the life in Warwickshire may
well have been among the solidest of re
alities. He had left it behind him for the
time being, and could afford to make fun
of it; but he knew it intimately and was
in after times to long for it and make it
once more in very deed his own.
He had come into a new world, the
world o*- which London was the center
and epitome, a world in which Mary
Queen of Scots had but recently been exe
cuted and the Armada scattered to the
winds, in which Hakluyt was publishing
his voyages, Greene and Marlowe writ
ing their dramas and Spenser his "Fairy
Queen." Henry of Navarre, better known
as Henry IV of France, was making good
his title to the throne which he ascended
in 1559. Sidney was dying at Zutphen.
Charles, Duke of Biron, two years older
than Shakespeare, a soldier who had been
made marshal of France at 16, was now
at 27 like Henry his King at 36, storming
cities and capturing fair ladies' heart?,
insatiable in arms as in love. Longue
ville, another doughty general, was a vig
orous supporter of Henry and Mayenne
was his most dreaded opponent in the
field. It was a time of adventure and of
profusion. Men were prodigal of others'
blood, of their own lives, of sentiment, of
lovers' oaths, of discourse, of poetry. It
was a world of generous illusions, of ro
mance, of the incredibly marvelous come
true or on the point of being realized.
Into this world "Love's Labor's Lost" was
born, and this world, too, like the petty
world of a Warwickshire Village, figures
on its pages. Here, under transparent
disguises, though such as were only pene
trated in our generation by Mr. Sidney
Lee. are Henry of Navarre and his two
redoubtable subordinates; and there his
formidable foe, Mayenne, transmuted
into another supporter. Dumain. As
Henry and his followers in 15SG hud met
at St. Brice the silken cohorts of
Catherine de Medici, and held courteous
parley with them, so do the imaginary
King and his companions encounter a
French Princess and het maids of honor.
As the Embassadors of Russia, on a mis
sion to woo a bride for the Czar, had in
1583 been entertained with elaborate cere
mony at York House, while Lady Mary
Hastings, a candidate for imperial favor,
he.d state in a pavilion erected on the
lawn, so in the play we hove a deputa
tion disguised as Russians, and a pavttton
pitched in the open field. The Spaniard,
Armado, sugests the Armada. The
play breathes of the fanciful and fan
tastic, of gallantry, of poetry, no less than
of tustlclty, the pitifully mean and absurd.
Shakespeare is still in the period of his
sonnets and of his non-dramatic poems,
such as "Venus and Adonis." In the
piny, as In the sonnets (NoÂ». 127. 130. 1321.
there Is a "dark lady." and it is signifi
cant that the Rosaline of "Romeo and
Juliet .'* like Berowne's mistress, has
black eyes (compare Act 111. scene i, line
I'.Ti. with "Romeo nnd Juliet." Act I,
scene 4. line 14). The poet's lyrical effu
sions have ease and grace, and he has
seldom done anything better in their kind
than such passages as Act IV, scone Hi,
11. 101-12^. 312-Sf>3. and the song already
quoted. Act V, scene 11, 11. 904-939.
Shakespears thus discloses himself to
us, in his earliest play, da a devotee at
once of romance and of realism, and,
though he was tin occasion to blend the
two mnr" perfectly yet he here an
nounces his adhesion to both. Thus the
fairies and the "tedious brief scene" by
"hard-handed men" in the "Midsummer
Night's Dream" exemplify the double
loyalty, it has often been remarked that
Jaquenetta and Costard are first sketches
for Audrey and Touchstone, as Berowne
and Rosaline for Benedick and Beatrice.
The poet alre^ady embodies precocious
wisdom in gnomic lines and couplets, asâ
The blood of youth burn* not with such excess
As gravity's revolt to wantonness;
or,
Honest, plain words best pierce the ear of
prief.
Some of the mintage of this maiden essay
is proverbial, or deserves to be so. I in

the original lines, and the consequence ig
: that we have the worse and the better
; side by rÂ»i f le. If one desires to know what
I Shakespeare, when 34 years old. meant
by correction and augmentation, let him;
I compare Act IV, sc. iii, 11. 302-4, with
350-3, and Act V. sc. ii, 11. 827-832, witM
; 847-881, âºâ¢specially 847-864. After sufficient!
study of vhe parallels let him, if so dis-<
i posed, attempt to improve some other
; passage of Shakespeare which does not
: quite satisfy him. In any case, let him
: remember what Ben Jonsor. has said iq
j his noble eulogy, and not hastily assume
I that Shakespeare was a careless impro-<
j viser:
I Yet must I not give Nature all: thy art.
I My g-er.tle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part;

For. though the poet's mother nature be,
His art doth give the fashion; and that he
Who casts to write a living lin?, must sweat
(Such a3 thine are) and strike the second heat
Vpon the Muses' anvil.
It is perhaps not too much to say that
I "Love's Labor's Lost" suggested Tenny
son's "Princess." Besides echoes likg
"Princess," I, 197-8, compared with Love' 9
Labor's Lost," V. ii. 8*55, and "Can
zonets." "Princess." IV, 117; "Love's
i Labor's Lost." IV, ii. 124, the central
situation is identical, reversing the roles
;of women and men. In Shakespeare's
drama the men, entertaining the monastic
; notion of learning and virtue, propose to
I exclude the temptresses who may witch
them ba?k to the world; in Tennyson it
is th? women who will have naught to do
{ with the men. In both cases the pagan
j gods of love and matrimony refuse to be
: deprived of their rightsâ and rites. The
I Renaissance temper triumphs, and asceti
i cism is baffled in its endeavor. In both
cases, too, the result is finally achieved
only through the chastening agency of
j sorrow.
Two or three matters of local or temp
orary interest may be noticed in conclu
sion. Armado. the Spaniard, is made the
mock of the Anglo-Saxon. In the original
' edition Shakespeare spells "Labor," not
; "Labour." Finally, he inveighs by the
! mouth of Holofernes against such rack
ers of orthography as to speak dout

QUESTIONS FOR RESEARCH AND
REVIEW.
1. This play Is a satire on a false Idea
of human conduct. What applications to
every-day life may we make from the
teachings of this comedy?
2. There is an educational principle
which Rousseau condensed into the maxim,
"Follow Nature." Do you find tNs to ba
the theme underlying this comedy?
8. "Love's Labor's Lost" has been
called a comedy of affectation. What
affectation is there in the King's view of
life? What affectations of speecn are most
noticeable? In what characters are these
affectations most pronounced? Does
Shakespeare seem to you to be "taking
off" certain speech-habits of his time?
4. Does the King act and talk like a
king? Sufficiently so for stage purposes?
5. How do the women and the men of
this comedy compare as to strength of
character? seriousness of motive? readi
ness In emergency? ability to intrigue?
6. How does woman figure as the teach
er in this play?
7. What do you judge, from this
comedy, is Shakespeare's idea of the social
relations of the sexes?
8. From the last act, do you think that
Love's Labors will be Lost, after all?
9. Is the rather somber ending of the
play disappointing? Do you wish for a
sequel? la a somher ending out of har
mony with the- idea of comedy? Is seri
ousness incompatible with humor? Com
pare the ending of this play with the end
ing of the "Merchant of Venice" and "The
Tempest."
10. Does this play show stationary
characters, or characters developing? Is
a play, in which characters are merely ex
hibited, as great as a play in which we see
characters improving or deteriorating?
11. Notice the amount of wit and word
play and repartee in this comedy. Does
the dramatist *eem to have restrained his
powers at any point? Does the word-play
prove wearisome?
12. Notice the rhyming of lines and
compare with any of the later and morÂ£
finished comedies. Is the need of rhymed
lines apparent here?
13. What four groups of characters are
there In this comedy? How are the groups
inter-related?
14. Do Berowne and Rosaline show
characteristics that distinguish them
from the rest? Are these characters fully
wrought out?
15. The dramatic action of this comedy
occupies two days. With what act does
the second day benr'n?

Wall Street and Business.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The Wall street horizon looks somewhat
brighter Extensive covering of 'short' con
tracts and readier buying by the larger opera
tors indicate a change of tone, and on the
whole the tendency of the week has been
towards 'bull' ascendancy. There has been no
notable Increase In the volume of transactions,
and as yet the gain Is chiefly seen In in
creased snap and confidence; which Is perhaps
all that could â â â¢ expected in the first mo
ments df escape from a protracted depression.
This recovery- is largely due to the Improved
aspects of the local money market. The drain
of currency to the interior Is abating, and
the near prospect of the reflux of money to
this center is trusted to bring about an early
revival in speculative securities.
"An ultimately active and much higher mar
ket la almost universally accepted as a fore
gone conclusion, and for manifest reasons.
T'pon a wide range of stocks prices are low
as compared with such an extraordinary ac
tivity In trade a.-= now exists throughout the
country. All accounts from the West represent
the prosperity among the farmers as surpass
ing everything in past experience. The manu
facturing centers also present an activity ex
ceeding all precedent. Everywhere industrial
j.lants appear to be running to their full ca
pacity, and in many cases day and night.
Labor was never so fully employed and never,
aa a rule, received such high wages; the effect
of which must appear ' In a large increase of
general consumption among the working
masses. The recent Increase in the foreign
demand for our manufacturesâ now amounting
to $339,000,000 per year, against 000,000 six
yearn ago appears to be losing none of its
remarkable progress In spite of the enlarged
home consumption. The mercantile classes
are â ing benefited by a continuous rise In
the value of their stock? of goods, and their
profits are In welcome contrast to the unsatis
factory results of the last five years of depres
sion. All this reflects the release of enterprise
from the restraints of the depression conse
quent upon the silver craze and the over-pro
duction of the last five or six years. It means
that, for that period, the demand of the coun
try, in every department of consumption, has
r.oen restrained to the last point of endurance;
nnd that now, with common consent, the peo
ple are In the ant of compensating for their
past curtailments In supplying their wants. It
also means that during this contraction of
consumption some nine millions of new popu
lation has come Into existence with Its large
additions to thÂ« wants of the national con
sumption. It Is doubtful whether, even among
the keen observers of Wall street. there Is
any adequate conception of what this change
of condition? Implies as to the magnitude of
the demands now pressing iipnn the markets
and the Industries of the crnmry. True It Is
nothing new to have n rwrUxl nf, trade depres
sion followed by a mrs <-><â  pr-op.;rous activity;
but we have never !..â¢â . .it n-ftneiwed a situa
tion in which thU kln.^ of rÂ»vlvÂ«] has existed
upon a acalo of such nwiKiittiide a:< wo now wit
ness."

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Oct. Generous rains through
out the Southwest, where claims of damage
by drought have been numerous recently,
started wheat easy. Indifferent cables also
encouraged liquidation. Trade was too dull to
permit of any notable break and the decline
was slow, though sure, the market . finally
reaching a point %@%c below yesterday's clos
ing price. In the meantime corn developed de
cided strength. This, together with general
outside buying, started an upturn and the mar
ket continued to advance until the close. The
market closed firm within - a fraction of the
best price of the day. Shorts were free buyers
on the late bulge and hastened the advance.
December opened ViffiUo lower at 70Vi@70%c, ad
vanced to 7<H4c, declined to 69%@70c, advanced
to 70% c and closed at 70^@70%0.
Corn wa,-Â» active a.nd irregular. â¢ . An estimate
that Nebraska's yield would amount to 2*4.
--000.000 bushels this year, or 14,000,000 more than
expected, encouraged short selling for a time,
but the pressure had very little effect, as the
market appeared to be oversold. Then early
sellers turned buyers, and In an effort to get
back former holdings the price was bid up
rapidly and the market, from being rather
downwardly Inclined, became- very strong. De
cember closed at 1 31Vi@31%c. . â¢
Sympathy with corn caused a slight advance
in oats. The market wu very dull and the
bulk of trading consisted of changing Decem
, ber to May. December advanced to 22%0 at
the close.
Provisions were weak early, but turned strong
near the close, with half a dozen . buyers for
everything offered for sale. , The strength in
corn brought about the change In sentiment.
January pork closed 20c higher, January lard
6jj7V4c higher and January ribs 7V4c higher.

TORY GROWING BRIGHTER.
Â»
a*>HK Republican municipal column
under tho able leadership of Horace
Davis made splendid advances yes
terday-. OnÂ© of tho events of the
â  <3ay Was a grand demonstration of
laboring men on the water front,
Mr. Davis was received by his fellow
vwters with great enthusiasm and
coTdiaUty. TT.<3 Republican leader is
popular among tho sons of toil because
ha is a wotkingtnan himself, and his
sj-mpitthios are with the. workers.
Another tending event yesterday was
thÂ« organization of the Horace Davis
JGuPfr.eSs Men's Club at tho Union League.
In r^ponse to circulars seventy or eighty
mrrr. wen kirO^rn in commercial circles
assembled in tho -clubroom at half past
3 o'clock. Little time was wasted In
preliminaries. The meeting was called to
order by Ok Â£>. Clark. J. P. JUe Count
moved that Charles S. Laumcister be
elected chairman. There was no dissent
ing voice and Mr. Latnnelster took the
chair of the presiding officer and ;
â¢acknowledged in littlng terms the honor
bestowed upon him. Tho organization
of tho meeting was completed by tne
election of James A. Wilson as secretary.
Chairman Laumeister then made a
bTief speech outlining the purposes of the ,
meeting:, taying that all Republicans
present were anxious to promote the !
interests of Horace Davis.
G. D, Clark introduced tho following i
resolutions;
"Whereas, ThÂ« ctty and county of San !
Francisco Is In the midst of the most lmÂ»
portant municipal campaign in its history;
and â¢-â .â :.â¢;
Whereas, This campaign ts fraught with
national inrportance as well aa local conse
quence, owing to the fact that the great ap
pointive power of the Mayor under the new
charter 111 make it possible for the Vic
torious party to control the State in the na
tiona! campaign to be held next year; and
Whereas, The republican Municipal Con
vention has nominated one of the hest tick
ets ever presented. to the voters of San Fran

be placed the Important trust of placing the
charter In operation, with the full confidence

ins assembled, do heartily and unanimously ,
Indorse tnÂ« Hon. Horace Davis for
Mayor, and the entire KfTrft"bll.-an \tdÂ£et,
and we do pledge ourselves, individually
an.-l collectively, to support them, and lend
every assistance and effort to make tho
election of Nov^mer C oha of tin* grandest
Republican sweeps in the annals of San
Francisco.
Applause greeted tha reading of the
resolutions. By a unanimous vote the
motion to adopt the resolutions prevailed.
Brief speeches by leading Republicans
present elicited enthusiasm.
Charley L. Patton was greeted with
cheers, lie said: "All we have to do to
elect the whole Republican ticket is to
work. It ie an excellent ticketâ the best
over presented to the. people of San Fran
cisco. Lt us get out and work for the
success of the ticket from this time until
j the election."
J. P. Le Count Indorsed the remarks of
: Mr. Patton, 1 holding that the ticket v.^3
i excellent throughout. "We should em
j ploy our energies," said Mr. Le Count,
'toward bringing out the downtown mer
i chants, It seoms to me that it is only
! necessary to say to Republican mer
chants, 'we present a candifiate for
Mayor, Horace Davis, whom we all ad
mire for n.is Intelligence, ability and In
i tegrity/ Mayor Phelan has served two
: terms, and when we present for ofÃce
or Mayor a man so girted &s Horace
Davis Republicans cannot reflisra to pup
â  port the. Republican ticket, Davis is as
( far ahead of Phelan a? it is possible for
: one man to be ahead of another.
A. V. Tan Duzer believed in making a
party nfrht on municipal line?. lift said:
"1 was '\ssochi.ten with Mr-. Phelah on the
committee of fifty to obtain a hew
charter. W\ . .
"Ask Phelan yourselves ff he did
not serve until the election drew near
and then resign, giving as an excuse
for his resignation that many influ
ential Democrats were against a new
charter and that he could not afford
to imperil his chances of success by
retaining his connection with the
charter movement.
"I wan at the meeting when he offered |
his resignation. In that campaign of 1896 |
he went out and joined Democrats who!
were against a new charter. 1 know that
he is a great clai\ner." .
'"Place before the taxpayers Phelan's
record as Mayor," uaid Mr. Van Duzer.
"In the j-ear ISS<, the salary list of. one
department was increased from $30,000 to '
$70,000. Look at the enormous increase
in the cost of conducting the municipal '
government since Phelan became Mayor.
The figures will startle the taxpayers.
The increase exceeds $1,000,000 per annum.
Orators of the Republican cause should
make themselves familiar with the fact of
Phela-n's extravagance."
C. L. King advocated personal work, the
method of applying to voters individually
and urging them to support Horace
Davis, "In the lig-ht for Chinese ex
clusion Mr. Davis sustained great pecun
iary loss," said Mr. King. "I should :
say off hand that he lost $20,000.
He has been a liberal man all his life.
He cannot give here and there $500 v as
his means will not permit such giving*
but during the hard times in this city
when poor people were suffering for the
want of bread, no roan applying at Hor
ace Davis' mill for a sack of flour ever
went away without it. Mr. Davis cannot
speak of these things, but his friends can
tell the people what kind of a man he ;
is."
Darby I^iydon, who mentioned that he
was a good deal around the. water front,
advocated personal work. He was sure
that active work would insure the elec- ;
tion of Mr. Davis.
A. G. Booth spoke in support of Re
publican principles and at the conclusion
of his remarks moved that a permanent i
organization of the Business Men's Club
be effected.
Henry G. "W. DinkÂ©lsplel directed atten
tion to the importance of forming a cam
paign committee to reach the merchants.
He moved that a committee of fifteen be
appointed. The motion prevailed, a.s also
did Mr. Booth's motion. for permanent or
ganization.
A recess was then taken and merchants
went forward to sign the roll of club
membership*
THOMAS HOPES
THAT HARMONY
WILL PREVAIL
Storing Floods for the
Good of All.
"It Is not reasonable to suppose," said
President Thomas of the California So
â¢ ciety tSt the Storage of Flood Waters
! yesterday, "that the National Govern
: ment will expend large sums of money
j for Internal improvement, lam speak
â  ins now of the proposition that tho Gov
ernment may be Induced to make large
â  storage reservoirs for the irrigation * of
j the arid regions of the United States."
That statement involves the difference
â¢ of opinion between the adherents of the
idea that the State should do the work
and those who believe that the Govern- 1
: mont may be induced to construct stor
i age reservoirs. Los Angeles will come
;to the convention on November 14 by
i delegation instructed to oppose the State
idea. There is sure to be a warm discus
sion of the subject matter. The subject
is of such great importance to the State
â¢ of California that Mr. Thomas was asked
to explain his position, which ho did to
some extent.
"I do not believe that the Government j
will take up this work by itself, In Cali
fornia, for several reasons. One is that
the people of the manufacturing States of
tho East, through their representatives in
Congress have an interest in opposing the
lending of Government aid to us. Sup- :
pose the Congressmen from Massachu
setts should be asked to vote for an ap
j propriation what would they say? They
could not favor it on the ground that it
would help us to become a manufacturing |
State In competition with their own con-
I stituents, now, could they? Neither
could the Congressmen from any other ,
manufacturing State.
"There is no. question that cheap power
would tend to â¢ powerfully stimulate our
manufacturing industries and would
creato many new ones; nor is there any
doubt that the extension in largo degree
of the area of land susceptible of culti
vation though irrigation would tend to
increase our population and business and
would invite additional . transportation
lines to enter the State in search of
traffic. : â  '
"California can act for herself because
the sources of her water supply all arise
within the State. Other States cannot
act independently, because they have not
that advantage. California can borrow
money at 3 per cent. To invest money in
State irrigation works would be insuring
an asset of the State which owns the flood
waters. In fifty years the works would
be paid for arid tho income could be used
for public purposes.
"There may be a contest on the part of
some of the delegates from Southern Cali
fornia at the convention, which we all re
gret for the creation of storage reservoirs
would be (or the benefit of all the State,
which might be divided into three irriga
tion districts. Southern California would
be equally benefited with other sections.
we have received answers to thirty invi
-1 tations to Supervisors and business or
-1 ganizations to send delegates to the con
vention AM have answered favorably,
with one exception. I hope that It will
he considered wise by the convention to
favor a topographical survey. The Gov
ernment would probably assist In that.
When the survey is completed we shall
have valuable and necessary knowledge*.
That is the first thing to bo done, in my
opinion." .' " . : â  : t

WATER FRONT WILL VOTE
FOR HON. HORACE DAVIS
r,3W tnen have ever received a more rousing reception on the -water front
than did Horace Davis, Republican nominee for Mayor, yesterday* lie
met the laboring men about th* noon hour near the transport wharf
and the cheers that greeted his appearance could be heard at Mar
ket, street. ' - .V:, â¢ â
J. E. Murphy > one of the men employed on the Government transports.
Introduced Mr. Davis. ite said: "Men of the water front: .I.had the pleas
ure of working for this man for revert years and I know what kind of a
man he is. It Bribes me great pleasure to Introduce him to the working
men of the front. Fellow laborers, the Horn Horace Davis* our next.
Mayo*.' 1
After the cheering had subsided* Mr. Davis made a plain, practical speech.
Ho spoke as follows: i.'
"My friends and fellow citizens: I am glad to he here for a chance to
speak to you. I know many of you personally, and Henry Peterson, whom'
you all know, thought it would be a good thing for me to come down here
and talk to you. This is familiar ground to me. I used to go to sea from
this dock. For three years I sailed from Folsom-etreet wharf on the Pa
cific Mail ships, and then I #ot tired of going to sea and came ashore and
went into the flour business. But I kept in touch with the Beaf&ring; men,
because one-half the flour that we make is made for export. Bo we all work
together. I cannot make flour unless it can bo sent away* and the ships
cannot take It away unless we make It.
"We are all together-. We are all interested in the welfare of the city
and the State. You cannot separate the people into classes, because we
are all interested In the same things-. Tou are interested- in g-ood govern
ment and in the new Charter, because it will give us a good government*
Good government means lower expense and lower taxes, and the lower the
ta^es are the lower your living expends will be v and the more the indus
tries will prosper and the more business will be done here.
"I believe under the charter we are in the path of better times, I be
lieve we are going to have more prosperity than we ever have had before*
I believe that if we have good> prudent, sound government, the city will en
ter upon an era of prosperity never before known. I can assure you that
the gentlemen who are on the Republican ticket with me are good, substan
tial, sound citizens, who are worthy of your suffrages.
"You do not build a good step and put bad men oh to run It Likewise
there Is no use in putting the charter in operation unless you have good men
behind it. That Is what we are going to do if you elect the Republican
ticket.
""VVe are all linked together. If the city is prosperous there is plenty
of work for us Work for men at gfeÂ»d wages. ThÂ« time* are very pros
perous here on the water front now-. That is because of the building up of
trade in the Orient. Wherever it comes from, it has made a demand for
flour for me; it has made a demand for work and wages for us all. What
I want to impress upon you is that it is a result of Republican policy, and
if you fly in the face of that you fly in the face of your own welfare,
(Voice in the crowd, 'You bet,') - -
"it you believe that, then, the thing for you to do is to go up to the
polls and cast a straight Republican ballot. Gentlemen, I thank you." : .
â¢ At the conclusion of Mr. Davis' speech three cheers were given for him,
and then the workingmen went back to their labors, the noon hour having
expired.

ing the impact of defendant's fist on his
nose. The. outcome of the action seems to
hinge on the words "voo zonnovay m.m
tay." It ceems to be the belief of the
French wing of the crowd that if Comte
applied this expression to Godeau, which
must be â¢â thing awful, the breaking
of his nose was but a consequence to be
expected. John Pontacq, Jean Malocq and
Godeau wore called to the stand yester
day on behalf of the defendant, and John
H. Henderson and Comte, the plaintiff,
took the etand in rebuttal. The testimony
followed the lines of the. preceding days
of the trial except that there was a
â¢ division of witnesses on the point as to
whether Comte had applied the epithet
"voo zonnovay montay" to his assailant.
The lawyers will probably Settle this
point during their argument to-day, and
after that the jury will pass Its Judgment
on the merits of the plaintiff's contention.
M'CARTHY WANTS HIS
ENGAGEMENT ANNULLED
An Exasperated Father and an Un

That Is Filled With Pe
culiar Situations.

'HAS. MCCARTHY, 1704 Leaven-worth st.
The foregoing: appeared among tho "per
sonals" of The Call yesterday, and its pe
culiar nature attracted marked attention.
Behind it is a tale of unrequited affection,
obdurate parents and an incensed but
constant lover. As appears in the above
personal, Charles McCarthy, a plumber
â whose place of business is at 1206 Pacific
street, is anxious that the world should
know that he Is no longer the prospective
husband of Miss Lottie Ott, daughter of
mot John "W. Ott, who resides at 13
Glover street. The young lady on the
ether hand admits having kept company
with McCarthy, but strenuously denies
that she ever was engaged to him. â¢ She
further states that she has been perse
cuted, slapped and annoyed by him and
believes that her adorer is not respon
sible for his actions. Her father and step
mother concur in this opinion, and they
have oven called in the aid of , Attorney
Devoto to have McCarthy restrained
from inflicting his love on the young lady.
Despite the harsh opposition of the
parents, McCarthy is willing to descend
to the uttermost depths . for her, and
swears that he will yet win her and if he
does she will never talk to her parents
again. Ho claims that if the stepmother
and the father had not poisoned Lottie's
mind against him they would have been
united ere this. McCarthy's story is
full of pathetic phases, while that of the
young lady has a numbeV of dramatic
climaxes.
â  Miss Ott Is confined to her bed through
sickness brought on by worrying over Mc-
Carthy's attentions. Sho stated that she
became acquainted with him while he was
engaged in doing some plumbing about

the house. While she never cared for him,
still she accepted his invitations to go out
with him, simply as a friend. She never
dreamed of marrying him. No, she did
not care so much for him. She always
believed him fickle, having often heard
thnt he was running around with other
girls. She stated that when the trans
port Sherman was sighted McCarthy
invited her to view the bay parade In
his company and failed to keep his en
gagement Her friendship for him ceased
at that moment, and since then he h;is
been writing her letters asking to be re
leased from the engagement. Miss Ott
did not reply to these epistles. McCarthy
continued his letter writing and the ex
asperated father of the object of his af
fection ordered the ardent lover's letters
returned to him unopened. This course
wns pursued. A week ago Sunday Mc-
Carthy met Miss Ott on the street and
asked her why she did not respond to his
last letter, and upon her replying that her
father had returned it he pulled it out of
his pocket and told her if she read it she
would confer a favor on him. His man
ner of making the PBqUftqt and his re
marks angered the young lady and she
tore the tetter into bits and threw it at
him. McCarthy lost his temper and struck
the girl in the mcuth, cutting her lip.
The next moment he was sorry for his
action and bugged forgiveness. She left
him without granting the boon and re
tired crying to her home. This was the
last straw and her father consulted with
Attorney Devoto, 1 - t the latter cautioned
his client not to take extreme measures,
as It would bring notoriety to his family.
The next day a letter was received from
McCarthy, in which he humbly apologized
for what ho termed a cowardly action.
This letter is now in tho hands of Attor
ney Devoto. So much for the girl's story.
The ardent plumber sighs for his in
amorata. He is sad, an.l when not en
(.'ai-'-d In fixing faucets or repairing leaks
he gazes on a $65 engagement ring which
he had hoped to place on Miss Ott's fin
ger. He claims that he has been engaged
to her for the past four months; that she
would have been his but for her parents.
Ills reason for inserting the advertise
ment was because she would not release
him from his engagement. He said he
notified Miss Ott, her parentts and At
torney Devoto that he would take this
course if he was not released, and as no
word was received from them he took im
mediate action- He said he regretted to
bring pain to Liottie, for he loved her
devotedly and would marry her at a
minute's notice. He thinks she would
make an ideal housewife, as she 18 a
food cook and a good girl. He cannot
orglve himself for striking her, and ex
cuses his action by saying that when he
met her he was unstrung, having Just
submitted to a paJnful operation on his
mouth. He will not forgive Captain Ott
nor his wife. He says they are the cause
of his misery and he will repay them foi
their interference.
Mr. McCarthy does not bear out the
statement of his enemies that he Is weak
minded. He is exceptionally bright and
is secretary of a number of well-known
societies'. He is simply in love with Miss
Ott and to win her he will go through
lire.

PEOPLE'S PARTY WORK.
Grand Ratification Meeting To-
Night at Metropolitan Hall.
Surprise in Store.
At Metropolitan Hall to-night there will
be a People's party and Silver Democratic
ratification meeting. The circulars an
nouncing the meeting contain the signifi
cant line:
"LOOK FOR A SURPRISE. "
Following the displayed line is the sen
tence: "A distinguished orator will en
tertain you." Perhaps Judge Magrulre,
who is In sympathy with the free silver
tendencies of the People's party, may ad
dress the meeting, but his name is not
heralded as one of the speakers. The
managers of the People's party present
these reasons why Democrats should vote
for Dr. C. D. Cleveland for Mayur;
Because, except by 'advertisement and label,
there is no other Democratic candidate for that
great office.
Because he is a pure Jeffersonian Democrat.
Because he is the only candidate for Mayor
Indorsing- geunlne I>emocratic principles, na
tional as well as local.
Because he is the only candidate for Mayor
who is openly tot Bryan and the Chicago Demo
cratic platform in 1900-,
Because he is honest, capable and possesses
a character beyond reproach.
Because he Is a man of family, and guests of
this great city cannot be received and enter*
tatned In a proper and dignified manner by a
bachelor.
At the ratification meeting to-night
there will be music by Blum's Band and
selections by the celebrated McKenzie

Mrs. Alice Smith Is
Sorry She Wed.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
9UB Broadway, Oct. 25.
Alice Smith, who is anxious to be di
vorced from Qeorge F. Smith, has,
through her attorney, Judge Alken of San
Francisco, filed an interesting complaint.
The Smiths were married about six
years ago in San Francisco. Smith was
a sea captain and made long voyages In
whaling ships to the Arctic In 1594 he
went north and since that time his wife
haa received no direct communication
from him, although she has heard many
reports of him from other northern-going
captains. It Is on these reports and
the fact that she has been deserted and
not provided for for live years that Mrs.
Smith bases her complaint.
The deserted wife has heard that at
some Indian village, not reached by pos
tal or telegraph service, her husband has
an Indian wife and appears far more con
tented than he did in his S,an Francisco
home. While she has no absolute proof
of the breaking of his marriage vows she
has testimony of an oral nature from sev
eral captains who claim to have personal
knowledge of the manner in which Cap
tain Smith is now living.

Examples of Work at the Bohemian

dore Wores.
An exhibition of pictures by Theodore

â was opened In the greenroom of the Bo
hemian Club yesterday. The pictures

Much of Mr. Wores' early work was done
In San Francisco in the "eighties." His
pictures rained distinct recognition In
London, New York and Paris, where he
exhibited examples of his work in Japan.
The collection at the Bohemian Club rep
resents In a measure the scope of his
'abilities as an artist.

REVOLUTIONISTS
ARE SUCCESSFUL
Andrade Is on His Way
to New York.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PONCE, Porto Rico, Oct. 25.â News ha 3
1 been received here concerning the sue
! cessful revolution in Venezuela and say
. ing it is reported that ex-Pre.sident An
j drade anQ his staff are on board the
steamer Caracas, which sailed from La
Guayara for New York via San Juan and
I Ponce, Porto Rico.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.-The Venezu
i elan legation here is in an anomalous con
: dition since the success of the Venezuelan
I revolution. Minister Andrade is a brother
I of President Andrade, who fled before the
I revolutionary general, Castro, who has
: taken control of the Government. It is as
. sumed that the Minister will retire, but
! there has been no outward change thus
\ far.
The Minister has been in Paris some
' time and is expected back shortly. His
! residence in lowa Circle has been given
i up, although the legation office is still
; maintained by Senor Pulido, the charge
1 d'affaires. As Pulido Is chosen by Gen
' eral Castro for Minister of War, he is
believed to be a near relative of the
charge here, and his interests are not
likely to suffer by the upheaval.
BRUTAL WIFE AND MOTHER.
Forces Her Paralyzed Husband to
Slave for Money to Buy-
Whisky for Her.
I A terrible case of destitution was
I brought to light yesterday afternoon,
whei^.Ofncer McMurray entered the base
ment of 838 Mission street for the purpose
I of investigating the reports made to him
! by ladies of the Church of the Advent.
! The basement is occupied by the Tom-
I linson familyâ father, mother and daugh
ter Juanita, the latter a child of 10 years.
I Sara Tomlinaon, the mother, takes In
! washing; that is to cay, she collects the
clothes from her customers and gives
them to her paralyzed husband, Joseph,
who washes and irons them. As he is
j crippled from the hips down, he has to be
Dropped up in bed to perform these task?.
The money thus earned is spent for liquor
by the woman, who, when drunk, is in the
habit, so it is' alleged, of beating the
j child unmercifully.
The man was found by the officer sitting
up in a filthy bed in a disordered, un
ventllated room, while his wife lay on a
i broken couch in a state of intoxication.
| Joseph Tomlinson was for fifteen years
! porter for Nathan, Dohrmann & Co., only
: leaving their employ two years ago, when
j compelled to do so by the progress of his
! disease. The only son of the couple is an
! able seaman on the Olympla, and served
with Dewey at the battle of Manila Bay.
He has been in the habit of sending home
Jin monthly, which was promptly con
fiscated by the woman.
Mrs. Tomlinson was taken to the City
Prison, where a charge of cruelty to
children will be entered against her. Offi
cer McMurray saw that the old man and
i the child were cared for last night, and
to-day they will be removed, the girl, if
possible, to some orphnn asylum and the
man to the City and County Hospital.

MINERS' CONVENTION
COMPLETES ITS WORK
William C. Ralston Succeeds
Jacob Neff as President,
THE men from the mines who came to
San Francisco as delegates to the
eighth annual convention of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association completed
the business of the session yesterday
morning and adjourned sine die. Hon.
Jacob Neff, who has presided over the as
sociation since its organization, felt that
his advancing years would not permit
him doing justice to the office, and he
to again become a candidate.
William C. Ralsnon was elected his suc
cessor by acclamation, amid the wildest
enthusiasm. Fred Zeitler was selected to
fill the office of vice president, made va
cant by the promotion of Mr. Ralston.
Treasurer Hendy and Secretary Benjamin
were re-elect <*d.
Ifany matters of moment to the mining
Industry came before the convention just
'. and much was done that will re
pult in benefit. A movement was made
toward securing at the hands of Congress
the creation of the Cabinet office of Sec
retary of Mines and Mining. If the move
ment does not accomplish the desired re-
Fult it will certainly make itself felt at
the. national capital. Never were mon
mnro determined in any matter than the
miners are in this one. Senator Perkins,
in addressing the convention on Tuesday,
told i lie delegates that the tight was hope
festerdy Judge Davis resented the
Senator's attempt to discourage the min
ers, and suggested that he had better
"com:' uff the perch," as, the- speaker as

previous occasions.
It is believed that the new president, !

: tion since it? organization, being a young
I man, will infuse much new life and create
I a new interest in the institution, in this
I the members feel that lie will receive
i assistance from the new vice president |
and the officials who were ro-elect.-ii.
The delegates were slow to assemble j
for the session yesterday morning. The
reception to the visiting delegates and
maybe other things that had happened |
the night before made early rising almost
an Impossibility, and it was some time
past the hour set for the meeting when
Chairman Neff called the convention tn
order. As soon as the few stragglers, for
whom the sharp, fresh air seemed to have
an attraction, were herded into the hall.
Congressman Julius Kahn was called
; upon for an address. He said that ho 1
would not attempt to talk about mining,
because the- must inexperienced miner in i
i the assemblage knew more about it than I
he did.
I "But Ido want to say a word about the I
j close relations of the city and the interior
; There was a time wh. n the people from '
the interior thought that thr-ir interests
1 and those of the city were dissimilar. '
There was never any excuse for such an j
idea. You must observe that the building '
i up of the city means increased prosperity
I to the interior. If our merchants arÂ»- flo
; ing well and making money, a demand is |
created for your products, and they are
! able to invest in your mines."
Congressman Kahn assured the conven
tion that he was in hearty sympathy with
the measures it favored for "the benefit of |
the mining industry. Ills voice and his 'â 
vote, he said, would be used for the min
ers In securing Federal aid in the matter j
of the conservation of fi*>od water On I
the subject of a Cabinet officer, he stated
that It was his opinion that the claim was !
a Just one, and that the miners deserved
that recognition from the national Gov
ernment. He advised the delegation to
continue the agitation until success was
theirs. He promised to do all that he pos
j sibly could to further the movement.
Judge R. B. Carpenter of Los Angeles i
I followed. "All that I know about mln- I
! ing." he said, "is how to put a great deal ;
: of money in a hole in the ground, but not ]
i how to get any out. I am a novice at got- <
i ting money out of the ground, but I am
a pastmaster in getting it in."
The business of the day, the selection
of a new board of officers, was then an
; nounced. B. N. Shoecraft, who favored ]
; making the delegates "scrap" for office j
at every annual convention, nominated.
ex-Senator Voorheis of Nevada for pr^si- j
dent. While appreciating the honor, Mr.
Voorhelp declined to stand for the office,
for the reason that his business would not
permit of him devoting the time to it Uiat
it deserved.
William C. Ralston was then placed in
i nomination by Judge John F. Davis. His
j nomlnatlns speech was a gem and fired
I the miners with enthusiasm. "Our new
president must be a miner," he said "and
: the question is, who is the man that can !
do us the most good and the best servico? j
We want a fighter. We want a man who !
j will not be fraid to face even a United
| States Senator and tell him to come off
his perch when he comes here and tells
us that our demand for representation in
| the Cabinet is unreasonable and likely to
i fail of success." Great applause greeted
, this reference to Senator Perkins' remarks
!of the previous day. Mr. Ralston was
i elected by acclamation, and in acknowl
| edging the honor, said that he was not
much at eloquence, but that when it came
to working he always did the best he
could.
Hon. Tirey L. Ford nominated Fred
Zeitlor for vice president, and he went

; Chairman Neft made a happy speech in
; introducing his young successor into
I office, and promised the miners that while
I his life lasted he would be with them in
i all they undertook. As he relinquished
j the gravel the delegates jumped to their
feet and pave him throe rousing cheers.

The following resolution offered by H.
I E. Pickett of El Dorado was unanimously
adopted:

clation be authorized to appoint a committee

At noontime the convention adjourned
sine die. In the afternoon many of the
delegates took advantage of the Invita
tion to visit the Union Iron Works. They
were takpn from Minion Pier 2 on the tug
Sea Witch and passed a pleasant after
noon inspecting the great ship-building
plant. Many of the miners left last even

15,000 pounds of shrimps. A recent an
alysis made of the Butchertown crusta
ceans developed the fact that they were
loaded with deadly ptomaines and highly
dangerous to health. Upon this showing
the Board of Health adopted a resolution
prohibiting the catching and selling of all
shrimps in Butchertown waters. The
Chinese refused to obey the order, and the
"â¢aid of yesterday was the result.
HITE CASE IS
CLOSED READY
FOR ARGUMENTS
Indian Woman Again
on the Stand.
There was no war yesterday in the trial
of Hite vs. Hite. Attorneys, court re
porter and Judge were on good behavior
and not a cross word or an innuendo
escaped their lips. All interested in the
case seemed anxious to bring it to a close
and in this they were successful. The
afternoon and morning sessions ended the
case as far as evidence is concerned. On
Monday morning the attorneys will go to
the arguments.
On order of Judge Jones the language
referring to blackmail, cowardice, guns
that were not called into action and the
passing of lies was stricken from the
record.
Several witnesses were put upon the
stand in the morning, James Ferguson,
Tommy Gibbs and the Indian woman who
goes by the name of the millionaire, for
a part oi whose fortune she is now light
ing. Ferguson testified that Hite and
the Indian woman were spoken of as aunt
and uncle by William Grove, who was a
frequent visitor at Ferguson's place in
the country. Tommy Gibbs was examin
ed and he said his mother was not accus
tomed to a long separation from Hite dur
ing the time they were on intimate rela
tions. He admitted she went to fan
dangos where general Indian revelry oc
curred, but every time with the consent
of Hite.
Lucy was then called and some time
was consumed in trying to show that
Lucy attended these native celebrations
at the request of the tribe because she
wasachieftain's daughter, not because her
inclination or desire prompted It. Under
a short cross-examination by Foote she
said she did not know her father's name,
but she knew he was a "Big 'Un " be
cause she heard It.
In the afternoon a* certified copy of the
marriage license of John R. Hite and
Cecilia Nouges was sworn to by Deputy
County Clerk F. H. Masson of Oakland.
It was dated October 12, 1897. Two days
later they were married and on the 15th
the marriage was recorded.
Attorney Foote wanted to examine F.
W. Berlin, as he had heard
Berlin had denied the evidence
given by Attorney Rodgers in regard
to the compromise. Berlin was not
to be found, so Foote concluded to close
kis end of the case. On agreement be
tween attorneys the case was closed. The
arguments will be delivered in Judge Heb
bard's courtroom next Monday, Van R.
Paterson speaking for the plaintiff and
W. W. Foote for the defendant.
