James W. Murphy did not credit the
story. "The English papers," he said,
â¢'are always getting up scares like this.
I do not believe the Clan-na-Gael of

privateers nor any rich friends who
are willing to spend their money that

that way. The St. James' Gazette Is a

A. J. Callum, who Is credited with
being high in the Councils of the Clan

WASHINGTON, June 27.â At th<>
British Embasy it is stated that no
communications relating to the Trans
vaal have been received, and the pub
lished report that representations ha.l
been made as to the shipment of
American-made arms to the Boers is
characterized as rubbish. In this con
nection it appears that a London press
agency recently had a dispatch from
New York statins that American firms
| were selling arms to the Boers. This
: dispatch came to the attention of
: Colonel Lee, British military attache
j here, and In the course of his inquiries
on military affairs he asked as to the
truth of this dispatch, receiving: but
little information beyond the fact that
â  arms were not likely to be shipped to
th" Transvaal, as it had no ports and
no means of receiving them. Colonel
Lee says this Inquiry was entirely on
his own account, and, so far as ho
, knows, the British Government has
, paid no attention to the matter.

As the citizens of Idaho con-

military tyranny, the officers in
con to' of affairs in the Cceur

WALLACE, Idaho, June 27.â
The State and military au
thorities have at last thrown
aside all subterfuge, and the
pretense that martial law is
! continued in the Cover d'Alenes for the
purpose of suppressing an insurrection
has gone with the others. The Gover
nor induced President McKinley to send
troops here by representing that Sho
j shone County was "in a state of in
surrection and rebellion," and Issued a
proclamation to that effect. Since the
date of that proclamation the authori
ties have inslÂ»iNÂ»<i tbat.'he condition of
anarchy described by - the Governor
still continues, and have sought to jus
tify every outrage perpetrated in the
name of martial law on the ground of
necessity.
When the wife of the editor of the
Mullan Mirror endeavored, through the
courts, to obtain possession of the few
paltry type taken from her by a com
pany of soldiers while her husband was
in the bull pen, an answer under oath
was returned to the process of the
court stating that the type had been
seized by order of the Governor and
"as a necessary means of suppressing
the insurrection now existing in Sho
shone County."
According to residents of this district,
no insurrection ever existed here, and
even the authorities now seem to have
wearied of the absurd pretense. They
have come into the open and the citi
zens of this county now confined in the
bull pen, without any charge whatever
against them, are told they may se
cure their liberty by signing an agree
ment to leave the State and promising
never to return. Yesterday Auditor
Sinclair was asked If he would release
a certain prisoner on bail.
"Why, certainly," he replied; "there
are more than 100 men in my charge
whom I should be glad to get rid of,
but they have become so attached to
their quarters they refuse, to leave. I
cannot drive them out."
This astonishing statement was made
with such positiveness that it bore the
stamp of truth, but investigation has
developed the fact that the reason Sin
clair cannot drive these men out of the
bull pen is because he requires of them
a promise to leave their homes and
families and the State of Idaho as a
condition precedent to their release.
There are many owners of property in
prison at Kellogg. Many of them are
married and are householders. These
man cannot understand why they
should be driven from their homes and
the locality in which they choose to
reside, when they have committed no
wrong. They refuse to be thus coerced
and maintain that they will pass the
rest of their days in the bull pen rather
than purchase their liberty by such
means.
This is why Sinclair cannot "drive
them out," and he will probably not
succeed, even though aided by officers
of the United States army who disgrace
the uniform they are enabled to wear
by the. toll and Industry of just such
men as they are now imprisoning.
Elisor Sutherland left to-day for
Pierce City and the south of Shoshone
County in search of jurors who will try
the cases of the rioters. This will carry
him 250 miles from here through Kob

Idaho, and Whitman, County, Wash
ington. No juror from that end of the
county has been summoned in the Dis
trict Court since the county seat was
moved from Pierce City to Murray, fif
teen years ago.

In the Chamber of Deputies to-day

PRESIDENT
NOT COMING
TO THE COAST
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELL
INGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON,
June 27.â Mrs. MeKinley's ill health
was the sole cause of the return of the
President and his party to Washington
two days before they had planned to
do so. Heretofore the excitement of
travel and receiving visitors has been
of benefit to Mrs. McKinley, and a dis
tinct improvement in her physical con
dition has been noticeable when she
has been away with the President.
Largely for this reason the President
went to New England and arranged
the Western trip which he had expected
to take later. It was found, however,
that instead of the New England trip
being beneficial, it had an opposite ef
fect upon Mrs. McKinley, and the
President and Dr. Rixey decided that
it would be better to bring her back
to Washington without delay.
The state of Mr?. McKinlcy's health
at this time is decidedly worse than it
has usually heen since she has been in
the White House, and the probable re
sult will be that the President will re
main in Washington practically all
summer, and will take very little if
any vacation out of this city.
President McKinley's projected trip
to the Pacific Coast, which had been
looked forward to in anticipation of the
enjoyment for himself and the Improve
ment in Mrs. McKinley's condition, has
been indefinitely abandoned. His pro
posed trip to Minne~ota has also been
abandoned.
The unfavorable turn in Mrs. McKin
ley's condition is attributed partly to a
cold which she contracted just before
leaving Washington. She is never
strong, and this cold seemed to weaken
her to such an extent as to make it
advisable to avoid exertion, which
would have been necessary had she re
mained, away as long as had been In
tended.
M. Deroulede asked permission to \
speak, but the President of the cham
ber, M. Deschanel, refused to allow
him to do so.
M. Lasies, anti-Semite, member for
the Condom division of Gers, accused
the Premier of having recourse to
subterfuges and a violent tumult en
sued. Sveral of the Deputies tried to
speak, but their voices were drowned,
and the President was compelled to j
suspend the session. When it was re
sumed urgency was proposed for M.
Deroulede's motion and was defeated j
by a vote of 397 to 70.
As a result of an altercation in the
chamber between M. Berteaux, Social
ist, and M. Millevoye, Republican-Na- j
tlonalist. these two Deputies will fight
a duel with swords to-morrow.
NEW YORK, June 27.â A Journal ca

sary arrangements for a special train

WASHINGTON, June 27.â Secretary
Alger this afternoon called on the
President and had an extended discus
sion of the situation in Michigan as to
the Senatorship and Governor Pin
gree's alleged utterances. When the
Secretary left the White House and his
attention was called to reports in cer
tain quarters that he intended to re
sign from the Cabinet, he promptly
and emphatically denied their truth.
He added that his resignation had not
been asked for, that he certainly did
not intend to offer it, and that he in
tended to remain in the Cabinet until
the expiration of this administration.

LOS ANGELES, June 27.â Brigadier !
General Harrison Gray Otis has heen or
dered to Washington, where, on July I,
ho will be mustered out of the volunteer |
service. This journey O the national j
capital revives the tale that General Otis I
is the probable successor of Secretary of
War Alger. When General Otis suddenly j
left his command in Manila it was then
asserted that, the editor had returned to
America with full knowledge that a po- j
Htlcal emergency was the motive for his
home-coming-. This statement has never
officially boon denied.
That Otis and McKinley are friendly is
shown by the proffer made the Los Angr>- i
les man two years ago of the Assistant !

was not landed by Otis arosn from the j
opposition of Alger. who bitterly fought j
the appointment on the ground that Otis |
had accused Alger of playing, during the |

hands of Collis P. Huntingdon. It is now
asserted that as Alg^r, owing to political
complications, will leave the Cabinet, the I
time is propitious for Otis to be taken i

ney to Washington will permit Otis to

Any Information as to His
Coming.
France! June 27.â The delay
in the arrival here of the French cruis
er Sfax, which left the waters of French
Guiana on June 10, with Captain Drey
fus on board, increases the interest In
the landing of the famous prisoner. All
sorts of reports and suppositions are
current. For the moment attention is
concentrated on the putting to sea this
afternoon of a ligfcthouse relief
steamer. Such vessels usually start in
the morning and return in the evening,
consequently the departure of the
steamer this afternoon has given rise
to the conjecture that she has gone to
meet the Sfax, and that Dreyfus will
be transferred on board of her.
The authorities continue refusing to
furnish the slightest information re
garding Dreyfus to the regular army
of newspaper men of all nationalities
now gathered here, anxiously seeking
news of the Sfax.
In the meantime the effervescence of
yesterday evening has quite evaporat
ed and this evening the inhabitants are
calmly promenading the principal
square, listening to the marine band.
WHITES AND
NEGROES IN
A BATTLE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., June Threo
negroes are dead and one is not expected
to live until morning as a result of a riot
between the white and negro miners at
the ore mines near Cardiff, in Jefferson
County. The dead are:
ED ELLIS.
JIM DILL.
ADAM SAMUELS.
The wounded: Rudolph Williams;
George Thomas, mortally.
The two races came to a clash late In
the afternoon in Glasgow Hollow, whero
the negroes had congregated armed with
Winchester rifles. A white man passing
along the road was heldup and roughly
handled. This news soon spread and an
armed body of white miners moved to
ward the Hollow. It is supposed it went
around by a circuitous route in the moun
tains and came upon the negroes unex
pectedly.
Ed Wise, the ringleader, armed with a
Winchester and a Colts revolver, fell at
the first tire. A rifle bullet did the work.
There was another volley and four other
negroes fell. Jim Dill and, Adam Sam
uels died in a few minutes after oeing
removed to a negro's house. George
Thomas was shot through the abdomen
with a Winchester bullet. He is not ex
pected to recover. Rudolph Williams
will live.
The trouble started yesterday when it
was thought that John Shepherd, who on
last Wednesday assaulted Mrs. Monroe
Jones Carcerona, was in that community.
The negroes armed themselves to pre
vent his capture. Both sides were
aroused, and only the timely arrival of a
Sheriff's posse prevented an outbreak.
This morning the negro miners held a
mass meeting and refused to go to work.
They all belong to a secret organization
known as the "Knights of Africa" or the
"Mysterious Men." They keep rifles and
ammunition on hand at all times. It was
in the afternoon that they gathered in
Glasgow Hollow, although with what in
tention is not now known.
Influential citizens say that the ring
leaders are now out of the way and they
hope to manage the other negroes.
Shortly after the riot Sheriff O'Brien
left here with a hundred armed men. He
has the situation in hand for the time
being, although late reports say the- ne
groes are talking of avenging the death
of their leaders.
Sheriff O'Brien, who is now at Bloss
bure:. has received a message from
Adamsville. three miles from that
place, askinp for protection. An armed

GOEBEL NAMED
FOR GOVERNOR
OF KENTUCKY
HON. WILLIAM GOEBEL.
I.OTTSVILLE, Ky., June 27.â William
Goebel. who with an Iron grasp has ruled
the Democratic State convention since It
assembled nearly a week ago, was to
night nominated for Governor on th â ;
v-slxth ballot after a contest un
paralleled in the State for bitterness anil
determination on the part of the winner
or for skillful manipulation. The end of
the !onp, exhausting fight brought a rea
sonable degree of harmony to the fac
tion?, which throughout the night bat
tled for every Inch of ground. Nearly
â verybody joined heartily in a demon
stration when their candidate appeared
for the first time before the convention
to accept the nomination and return his
thanks.
The Goebel forces held the opposition
closely down to business all day, forcing
continuous balloting, defeating it when
it showed slpns of weakness and Fought
â : = a sine die adjournment, compelling; a vote
â 'â¢ ' 'on a proposition to drop the hindmost
man on ea,ch ballot aft'^r the twenty-fifth

shortly after 10 o'clock to-night with col
;â¢' '. -.on" flying. Stone was dropped on the
â¢. twenty-fifth ballot and Hardin proved un
" able to control enough of the Stone votes
â¢â¢ to win. The scenes during the last bal
: - . lot were dramatic, though not so exclt
'. ; Ing as many in which the delegates had
;. " participated.
After the nomination the convention en
â¢' Joyed a few minutes or relaxation and
â¢ â  reconciliation. Speeches were made by
Congressman Wheeler, Judge Tarvin and
â  other managers for th>- three candidates
and the theme of all was: "Get together
â and win."
A morning session of the convention was
held, at which six fruitless ballots were
.taken. After a recess -.null 3 o'clock two
.; â  more ballots were taken with a result al
â¢' -most exactly like the first taken Saturday
â¢â¢ night. This made twenty-one ballots In
all, the last one resulting: Stone, 30S;

side is expecting an attack. The trou

body <>f white men flr : -d on some negro

tlon providing that the convention ad
journ sine die, and that the State Cen
tral Committee he empowered to take any
action ii ;ssary to place a ticket in the
tii-lil for the campaign of 1899.
The delegates were almost taken oft
their feet at this point by the appearance
on the =t:i?p Bide by side of Captain W. J.
Stone and General P. Wat Hardin. They
di'l nut know just what was to happen.
nm they saw a hope of relief from the
strain tney bad been under for a week.
and pave the candidates a welcome even
more hearty than their personal popular
ity would have called forth.
Stone spoke briefly, followed by Hardin.
Both declared they believed the interests
of the Democratic party would be best
served by the adoption "f the resolution.
The chairman, however, In a short
speech declared the resolution out of or
der and refused to recognize an appeal.
The twenty-second ballot showed the
(ffp.t of the adjournment resolution In
disintegrating the Stone-IT:ml!n forces.
Stone lost about thirty votes.
At this point E. A. Cullion offered a
resolution providing that after the twen
ty-lift h ballot the hindmost candidate be
dropped and not voted for thereafter. The
Stone and Hardin leaders made another
stand, but they could not control their
forces. The resolution was adopted by
a vote of .''72 to '.2^. and at 8 o'clock the
twenty-third ballot was ordered. The re
sult: "Stone 350, Hardin 34(5. Goebel 361.

ceived the smallest number of votes, was
dropped and the next ballot was begun.
It was concluded with difficulty and an- |
nounced as follows: Goebel 560; Hardin 531.
This provoked aa much noise as any
event of the convention, and for the first
time nearly all the delegates joined in it.
Mr. Gtoebel was Introduced and made a
short speech of thanks. When the speerh

A NEW SMELTER
FOR SHASTA COUNTY
George Bayha, Representing a Ger
man Syndicate, Is at the Head
of the Enterprise.
REDDING, Jun.- 27.â There is evidence
that another great smelter is soon t>> be
erected in Shasta County. It will he built
and operated by a German syndicate.
George Bayha, formerly a bicycle manu
facturer in Germany, is the local repre
sentative of a number of German capital
ists. During th" last three years Bayha
has filed locations on twenty-five copper
claims on StlUwater Creek, about twenty
miles from Redding.
Extensive development work has been
done on these claims. Bayha secured
bonds on adjoining claims and has just
made a payment on one bond for $3h.ivhi.
It is proposed to erect a smelter near th.
site of the claims. The syndicate has
:â . cured option? on considerable adjacent
lands. Electricity generated by water
pow^r will be used for motive power and
for other purposes. There seems to be
every evidence that the German syndicate
will shortly begin work of building a
smelter and a railway line eight miles in
length to connect with the Southern Pa
cific. The new smelter will double the
copper output of Shasta County.

LOS ANGELES, June 27.â Major Ben
Truman, one of the commissioners to the
Paris Exposition, has returned from the
north, where the California commission
ers held an important session. Discuss-
Ing the meeting Major Truman said:
"Commissioner Runyon's report was of
s; eri-.i] Interest. lie had just returned
from Chicago, where he was In cunsulta
i'< .1 with Commissioner General Peck. He
had a very satisfactory account to give
of the liberality with which California is
to be treated. The Golden State will be
allowed its full share of space in the
departments of horticulture, agriculture,
viticulture, mining, fishing, forestry, etc.
The State's Interests will be carefully
looked after in a general way by the
T'nited States Commissioners. Director
of Education 11. J. Rogers is expected to
visit California, as ;ir<' two representa
tives of the agricultural, viticulture! and
hortic ultural intf rt sts.
"The United Stat< s will handle the ship
i ping of State exhibits from New York to
I Paris. In the exhibition halls all displays
musf. be uniform. No display can stand
over eleven feet high. TTte exhibits will
â  be collective, each exhibitor, even of a
, sample, will be known by the label and
receive full credit for his display. Wheat
: samples will be shown in the wheat ex
hibit, cotton in the cotton exhibit, etc.
"The United States commission will
construct t lie necessary cases for a col
lective display of exhibits of agricultural
and horticultural food products. These
will be uniform in design. All raw prod
ucts needing preparation, as cereals, cot
ton and wool, will be sent to Washington
to be selected and prepared. All agricul
tural and horticultural exhibits are to be
taken to Washington ami vitlcultural and
mining- exhibits to Chicago.
"An effort will be marie to secure mod
els of the cruiser Olympia and the battle
ship Oregon for the California display.
"The system of refrigeration of fresh
fruit may be exhibited during nearly all
the months of the exposition. This will
â  give California fruit growers a great op
portunity. All exhibits must be in Chi
racn or" Washington by September 30,
thereafter to be cared for by the com
missioner general. "
The Commissioners agreed to hold the
next session on July 10, at which the
necessary appointments will be made and
the details of collecting and arranging
completed. The total appropriation of
the United States for the exhibition is
12,100,000, which accounts for the great
work of supervision and State aid. Cali
-1 forniii !s looked to by the United States
Commissioner for the finest display. The
Southern Pacific Company is planning to
m;ike a $. r >o.ooo display at the exposition,
providing it is not asked to go to Tiols de
I Vincennp.s, located seven miles from the
â  fair grounds proper and useless for expo
sition purposes.
STOCKHOLDERS REFUSE
TO PAY ASSESSMENTS
Affairs of the Union Bank Are
as Badly Tangled as
Ever.
SAN JOSK. June 27.â The $10 per share
assessment levied by the directors of the
Union Savings Bnnk became due yester
day. l*p to that time but one person, H.
J. Wallace, had paid the assessment. A
few days ago he paid $200 In on twenty
shares. This looks rather discouraging
to depositors.
At yesterday's meeting of the directors
it was decided to bring suit against all
the stockholders to collect this assess
ment. The latter have till July IE to pay
up. Attorneys Hatch and Rea were In
structed to prepare papers for suits
against the delinquent stockholders and
to file the suits immediately after that
date.
Yf-strrday's meeting of the directors
broke tip in a wrangle. President Rea
and his colleagues are not working to
â¢ gether. Rea lias adopted a clever way
of trying to rid the board of Directors
Joins. Stock. Calliseh and Katon. The
latter four are incline! to fight the as
sessment. Rea, during a heated discus
sion at the meeting, drew ?20 out of his
i pocket and paid the $10 assessment on the
, share he represents as trustee for a minor
son, and risked that the balance be ap- ;
plied on the JIOO assessment duo on the
ten shares Director Simpson represents
' for h son. Rea also proposes to pay
something on Director I Minion's assess
â¢ mem. The fact that the other four direct
. ors are going to fight the assessment
makes them liable to forfeiture of office,
, and President Rea Is playing a smooth
little game to unseat them.
I; is estimated that not over 20 per cent
, of SlfiO.itfO the $10 per share assessment
- ought to bring in can be collected, and
then only after hard legal battles.
REDWOOD'S TRUSTEES
WILL ISSUE BONDS
Money to Be Used for the Installation
of an Electric Light
Plant.
REDWOOD CITY. June 27.-The Board
of Town Trustees has just passed an or
dinance creating a bonded indebtedness
and providing for the issuance of the
bonds for the electric light plant recently
voted by the citizens of Redwood. Two
propositions were submitted to the elec
tors and hnth were carried. The bonds
for the purpose mentioned above will 1,.
Bold Immediately and the watrrpipe
bonds will be issued as soon as the price
of pipe falls.
As soon as the electric light bonds an
sold, which will be in a few weeks, the
Trustees will commence the work of in
stalling the plant. The work will be
completed as soon as possible. The Trus
tees expect to receive a large revenue
from the proposed Improvement, which in
time will materially lessen the burdens of
the taxpayers. It is thought the plant
will be in working order by the lirst of
October.
ELECTION CONTEST GOES OVER
Nevada's Supreme Court Adjourns
Until Aftsr the Fourth.
(ARSON CITY. June 27.â Governor Sad
ler finished his count this morning in th<>
Kubornatori.il contest, the final county
being Churchill. Little gnin was made by
him in this county and McMillan won no
advantage. In the afternoon McMillan
resumed his case, introducing Ormsby
County. The First Ward developed nine
objections on his part, while Sadler filed
eleven. McMillan will probably pain one
in this ward by actual count. The Second
Ward proved poor ground fur both con
testants.
The counsel for McMillan brought things
to a sudden halt by petitioning the court
for a continuance pending- the arrival of
White Pine County ballots. The court en
tertained the plea, adjourning until July
C. McMillan's attorneys also asked for
the privilege of re-examining the ballots
objected to by Sadler. This was denied
by the court. No decision will be filed un
til the full testimony is in on both sides.
Court adjourned until July 6.

HELDMANN HAS
THE WINNING HAND
The Priest Has a Very
Large Following.
WILL MAKE LORIMER HUSTLE
CONSIDERED THE STBjONGEST
MAN THAT CAN BE PUT UP.
He Is Waiting the Consent of Arch
bishop Feehan, and if This Is
Given Will Enter Boldly
Into the Race.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 27.â A special
from Chicago to the Herald says: Re
publican and Democratic leaders are
alike agreed that Father George D.
Heldmann of St. Paul's Roman Catho
lic church, Chicago, whose name has
been mentioned as candidate for the
Democratic nomination for Congress
In the Second District, would be a
strong man to contest the seat with
Representative Lorimer, the present
Republican member. Father Held
mann's statement of the situation is as
follows:
"I can say without vanity that I am
favored not alone by my own parish
ioners, but by the Catholics and Ger
mans of this district. I have always
been a Democrat, and there is no law,
ecclesiastical or civil, which prevents
the election of a Catholic priest to
Congress."
In case Archbishop Feehan gives his
consent to Father Heldmann's becom
ing a candidate, he will undoubtedly
receive the nomination. Republicans
generally admit that Father Heldmann
would be one of the strongest can
didates that could be put forward, and
If he is nominated it is doubtful if the
Republicans will make any nomination
against him. It is said to be doubtful,
however, whether Archbishop Feehan
will consent to the priest accepting the
nomination, as he is known to be op
posed to clergymen mixing up in poli
tics.
Father Heldmann was born in Chi
cago fifty-one years ago, and has lived
here all his Hfe. He is of German ex
traction, and was prominent at the
mass-meeting called by German-
Americans to protest against a Brit
ish-American alliance.

Yolo's Big Fruit Crop
WOODLAND, June 27.â Rumsey is a

the importance of the fruit industry in
Western Yolo. It says: The fruit season
has been a busy one. In some Instances
much fruit has gone to waste for want
of help to care for it in season. Nearly
twenty cars of fruit have been shipped
from this point thus far. The early fruit
season is about at an end. There is quite
a. crop of later fruit, the most of which
will be dried.
FLOODS ALONG
COLUMBIA RIVER
Damage Between Van
couver and Astoria.
THE WATERS ARE RECEDING
SILT LEFT BY OVERFLOW A
COMPENSATING BENEFIT.
The Flood Has Been Twenty Feet
Above Mean Low Water and
Has Caused Considerable
Damage to Crops.
Special Dispatch ;â¢ Tfc
TACOMA, June 27.â Men Jusl re
turned from Portland and the Colum
bia River Valley report that great
damage is being caused by inundations
along the Columbia River between
Vancouver and Astoria. Many thou
j sand acres of farm lands have been
overflowed. Hundreds of ranchers
have moved to high lands, taking their
cattle and farm animals. The inundat
ed district includes a large stretch of
farming lands lying along the Oregon
bank of the Columbia between the
mouth of the Willamette and Goble.
Many farmhouses are filled with water
up to their second story and barns like
wise. Savvies Island is entirely over
flowed and all the inhabitants have
been obliged to flee. This is one of the
most important islands In the Colum
bia River, being the neat of extensive
farming operations.
Savvies Island receives a compensat
ing benefit from these periodical over
flows in that the silt left by overflowing
waters nearly doubles the crops grown
for several successive years. At Ka
| lama the Northern Pacific tracks and
I depot are under water. The single track
{ remaining in use is built up on the bluff
! side and considerably above water. For
many miles northward from Kalama
farms are under water on both sides of
the Northern Pacific.
While the waters lack seven or eight
feet of being as high as during the
great flood of 1894, they are said to be
causing more damage than during any
previous high water, excepting that
one. The waters are believed to have
reached. their highest point and are re
ceding some to-day. Travelers who re
turned from Portland to-night state
that nearly a mile of warehouses along
the Willamette River are flooded. Some
of these warehouses are two or more
stories high and the upper floors are
filled chiefly with grain.
A special from Vancouver, Wash.,
says. The Columbia River has been
nearly at a standstill for twenty-four
hours. The highest point reached was
twenty-four feet ten Inches above
mean low water. The high -water has
caused considerable damage to crops
and property on river bottoms and
along the water fro-nt.
A vast accumulation of driftwood
collided with the solitary bridge pier in
the Columbia in the lower part of the
city, wrecking the wooden framework
at the upper side of the pier. This pier
was built for the Union Pacific Rail
road in 1890 and cost $200,000. The
river, where it covers the Columbia
Slough, on the Oregon side, where it is
crossed by a long trestle supporting the
street-car line, presents an interesting
sight. The water for nearly two mllen
is within five feet of the track and in
several places passes under the trstle
in a swift current, caus'jag passengers
to be nervous when passing over these
places.
SUGAR WAR MAY NOW
BE FINALLY SETTLED
Report Not Confirmed, but General
Anxiety to Make Money
Gives It Strength.
NEW YORK. June 2S.â The Tribune
says: The report that the sugar war has
j been practically settled finds many be
lievers in Wall street, although it has had
no official confirmation. "Wall Street
Topics, discussing the losses incurred in
this contest by the sugar company and
ita competitors, will say in its issue to
; day:
The cost of the war to the sugar trust
! (the American Sugar Refining- Company)
i cannot be far from $10,000,000. The cost to
I Arbuckle Brothers and to Doscher (New
' York Sugar Refining Company) is insig
: nificant compared with the cost to the
sugar trust.
Arbuckle Brothers and Doscher are will
ing to follow the trust in advances, for
they are anxious to make money. They
i will co-operate with the trust should It
make a difference of 90 cents, which was
; the difference prevailing before the sugar

WHOLESALE GROCERS
ORGANIZE A TRUST
lowa Business Men Appoint One Man

DES MOINES. June 27.â 10wa whole- j
sale grocers formed a trust of their own 1
to-day. The plan is to have one man
buy all the goods handled by the leading
jobbers of the State. In a statement
given out by the officers of the combina- |
tion it Is said the products handled shall !
be limited to California canned fruits, I
salmon, cereals, syrups, etc. Parties who
claim to be acquainted with the real ob
jects of the organization say that the ,
"etc." is to cover practically all good*
handled by wholesale grocers in lowa,
although the experiment will first be triea
with California fruits.
One man will do all the buying. F. C.
Letts of Marstaalltown is to be the man.
: It is believed when the organization has
perfected its plans it will expend through
its one buyer in the neighborhood of $20,
--' 000.000 a year.
j The houses joining the organization be
i lieve they will be able to buy goods from
I 5 to 15 per cent cheaper than tindfr the
system of every house buying its own

Why Some Men Are Never
i Satisfied With Themselves
or the World at Large.
How to Cure the Chronic "Kick-
ing" Habit.
We seldom enter into conversation with
a man nowadays who does not speak bit-
I terly of his lot. In fact the closing years
of the Nineteenth Century is an age of
pessimism. Some are dissatisfied with
I their business affairs, many complain at
: the manner in which the war on the Phil-
ippine Islands is being conducted, while
others are unhappily married. The great
mass of men, however, young or old, mar-
ried or single, have some bodily ailment.
The latter class can overcome their
troubles more easily than the man who ia
embarrassed financially or annoyed with
family, social matters or affairs of state. i
Men who are suffering with a disease o.J^-
embarrassed by a weakness can be re-
j lieved if they will place their health in the
hands of California's famous specialists.
iDr Meyers & Co. Thousands of men on
i the Pacific Coast are talking about the
I good work accomplished by these physl-
â  cions. Thousands more are talking about
1 their peculiar business methods, but more
dally of their terms of payment.
The fact that the price of a cure may be
I deposited in any bank or with any re-
sponsible business house in San Francisco,
to be paid to Dr. Meyers & Co. only when
: the patient is permanently cured, is a
1 revelation to many. If. however, the suf-
ferer is not prepared to deposit the price
I of a cure at one time, payments may be
1 made in weekly or monthly installments.
The staff of Dr. Meyers & Co. is com-
,' posed of physicians of the highest stand-
ing and the widest ;yid most successful
experience as specialists. Among the ail-
ments they cure are the following: Lost
1 Vigor, Premature Decay, Unnatural
! Losses, Wasting Drains, Nervous Debil-
: ity, Stricture, Rupture, Tumors, \ arico-
cele. Diseases of the Kidney, Bladder,
i Liver, Spleen, Spine, Heart, Blood, Skin,
i Stomach, Eye, Ear, Lungs, Head, Nose
I and Throat.
A man who will go through life weak
â¢ and diseased is very unwise when strength
, and robust health can be had for the ask-
ing. Dr. Meyers & Co. have proved in
: thousands of cases that they can do all
1 they claim. Their long experience, suc-
cessful and increasing practice on the Pa-
cific Coast, Is evidence of their superior
skill, methods and remedies.
Home curesâ Dr. Meyers & Co. cure a
' great many patients every year without
seeing them. Those who are interested

THE WILDS
OF SIBERIA
Remarkable Journey of Mrs.
Stevens, an American
Woman.
ACROSS THHTEPPES
Accompanies Her Husband Over the
Route of the Trans-Siberian
Railway.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
.': VICTORIA. June 27.â Among the
passengers who arrived on the Empress
'of China to-day was Mrs. M. M. Ste
:vens ; wife of the manager in Russian
Asia of the Baldwin Locomotive Works
Of Philadelphia, who a short time ago
â completed a journey hitherto une<iualed
fry an American woman. She accom
panied her husband across the great
Siberian wastes and steppes, over the
.â¢uncompleted trans-Siberian Railway
and by wagon and tarantass from St.
Petersburg to Vladivostok. The long
and arduous Journey of 9577 versta was
accomplished in forty-two days-
It was a race against time. During:
last August, when her husband, who
is now at Vladivostok, was residing in
the Russian capital, he received a tele
gram from the Baldwins telling him
that seventy-seven locomotives were on ;
the way to the Siberian coast and
(would arrive about two months after
the message was received. He imme
diately made arrangements with the
Russians for a special train and they
hurried aJong the rails to Zema, where
the. road then ended. There arrange
â¢.monts were made whereby a car was
' attached to the construction train and
â  the two Americans journeyed on over
â¢the unballasted trail and loosely laid
rails to within seven versts of Irkutsk,
â .the Siberian capital. Thence they went
â on â¢in , peasants' wagonsâuncomforta
ble, â  sprir.gless vehicles which made
/them think comfort was a lost joy.
â  Thus they reached Lake Baikal,
where they caught a steamer in which
they crossed the big inland water. The
comfort of the steamer, such as it was,
â¢however, soon passed, and again they
journeyed In the jolting but pictu
resque tarantass for days. They ac- ;
complished .1058 versts in the springless
vehicle with but one interruption, when
â¢they were stopped by a band of exiles
who presumably meant to rob them.
JVhen the gold braid and brass buttons
of the Russian officials who accompa
nied them were seen they decamped.
.After s' . eral days of this tiring
method of travel they reached Strie
tence, which is to be the western
terminus of the line, Mrs. Stevens said,
for the directors have decided to take
the traveler thence to Vladivostok by
steamer, or by the projected railway .
through Manchuria to Xewchwang
and Port Arthur.
From Strietence they took a steamer
trip 300 ver.-us down the Chilka River |
to wh-^re that river and the Agroon form
the source of the Amur, and thence :
down the Amur to Vladivostok.
The Traps-Siberian Railway, Mrs. :
Stevens says, will not be connected for i
several years yet.
â¢'They say two years, but I think It
will he considerably longer than that
before this is opened," she said.
. It is a fine line and, when completed,
will be remarkable in many ways. It Is
the longest railway In the world. It
has some exceedingly lengthy and
strong bridges, and some other great
works of engineering skill. The loco
motives are all of American make. The
F.eventy-seven sent by the Baldwin peo
ple ire now being fitted up at Port
.Arthur and Vladivostok â forty at Port
Arthur and thirty-seven at Vladivos
tok. The Trans-Siberian is not the only
line on which the American locomotive
building firm is putting engines. Some
are now on the way to the Far East
â¢ for the Imperial Chinese and other lines
â¢being constructed. Some are also being
sont to Japan.
; The change in the plans of the rail
way whereby it goes thr<->UE:h Northern
China is said to be due to the fact that
Russia has found big swamps in the
i-riginal route projected to Vladivostok.
Xow it wishes to give up this route and
construct a line directly from Kiachta
to Peking, following the old caravan
route. Thence the line would lead via
Mukden to Newchwang and Port Ar
thur, with a branch line to Vladivostok.
â¢During my stay in Vladivostok,"
says Mrs. Stevens, "I was impressed
â with the way Russians are hurrying
troops to the coast. Some 2000 Cossacks
arrived there from Odessa during my
stay, and 1000 were coming on one ship.
Many are also being rushed to Port
Arthur, but I do not know in what
numbers. All are coming by steamers,
for the railroad line Is not near enough
completed to allow of transportation of
troops."
KOREAN MOB MURDERS
STREETCAR MOTORMEN
Takes Awful Vengeance Because of
the Accidental Killing of
Children.
VICTORIA, B. C, June News was
sbrought by the Empress of China, which
arrived to-day from the Orient, of a big:
-riot at Seoul, the Korean capital, in
which the ten cars owned by the electric
railway recently established there were
smashed and burned and several of the
tramway employes killed. A number of
the Japanese and European motormen
"saved their lives by flight
â¢ The carp, like those in use In many
American cities, are without fenders, and i
â¢â :?Â«â¢ vÂ« ral children have been run over and
â killed since the service opened in Seoul.
j.The; killing of another child on May 26
last brought matters to a climax, and a
mob of between 400 and 500 persons
gathered. Two cars wore found together
â  and: these were surrounded by the rioters. '
Who were greatly excited. They killed
those fn charge of the cars, and, after
smashing, the cars; piled the debris In a
heap and destroyed it by fire.
: The mob, which was incensed against
the company not only because of the
death of the children; but also because of
â the drought, the Ignorant class attribut
ing it to the construction of the tramway
(service, then went to where the remaining:
cars-were and destroyed them one after
another. Including the Emperor's car.
This was a car reserved for the exculsive I
use of the Emperor. It was richly up
holstered and the windows were em- !
blazoned with the Korean arms. Large I
platforms at each Bide furnished room
for the accompanying guard.
The road had been opened but two
weeks when the riot occurred. The open
ing was made the occasion of a demon
stration by the Emperor, who himself
pulled the lever of the company's power
house and started the service on May S.

NINE NEW REGIMENTS
TO BE SENT OTIS
PRESIDENT READY
TO FURNISH PLENTY
OF FRESH TROOPS
Military Governor of the Philip
pines Has Only to Ask for
What He Wants.
CALL Headquarters, Wel
lington Hotel, Washing
ton, June 27. â While no
decision has yet been reached as
to the number of men to be
i raised for the provisional army,
the President has authorized the
continuation of enlistments be
yond the number required for the
regular army. This means that
the President proposes to have
enough soldiers ready for service
should further consideration
show the necessity of providing
Otis with additional troops.
It seems to be the impression
in army circles that nine regi
ments, sufficient to form three
brigades, a total of 14,130 men,
will be organized and put in con
dition to be sent to the Philip
pines in time to assist in opera
tions in the fall. The question of
raising part of the provisional
army was discussed to-day by the
President with Secretary Alger,
Adjutant General Corbin and
several other members of the
Cabinet who called at the White
House. Some of these insisted
that General Otis was the best
judge of the number of men he
requires, and as he has said that
30,000 were sufficient they were
opposed to sending more. They
finally authorized Secretary Al
gar to continue recruiting so that
it will be possible, should it be so
desired, to form new regiments
from the recruits obtained.
Should it be decided not to or
garyze these then the recruits will
be distributed among the regular
regiments, to take the places of
men who are invalided home or
whose terms of enlistment have
expired. The recruits enlisted
will be sent to Manila as prompt
ly as possible, in order to keep
General Otis' effective fighting
force at 30.000 men. Adjutant
General Corbin said to-day that
under the provisions of the army
reorganization law the President
was compelled to "raise volun
teer regiments" and could not
muster in State organizations, i
Officers, he said, would be ap- !
pointed by the President and 1

VON DEIDERICHS
GETS A LETTER
FROM DEWEY
VANCOUVER. B. C. June 27.â
Admiral Dowry has contradicted
the story of his reported feelings
and statements at the time against
thÂ«- Germans at Manila.
Admiral yon Deiderlchs received a
letter from Dewey, which explained
briefly that he had not made the
statements that were attributed to
him about blowing the Germans as
well as the Spaniards out of the
water If the former Interfered with
the conduct of affairs in any way.
The North China News says that
It wa.= Informed that as the Ger
man admiral was passing through
Hongkong homeward bound in the
Prince Heinrich he received the let
ter from Admiral Dewey expressing
the latter's regret at the unfounded
statements made as to thoir rela
tions at Manila. The German ad
miral asked for permission to pub
lish the letter and this was readily
granted. A peculiar feature was
that when this announcement was
made from Admiral Dewey on the
German ship the Germans actually
raised hearty cheers for the Amer
icans.

ALGER SUPPRESSES THE
REPORT OF ANDERSON
NEW YORK. June 27.â A World spe
cial from Washington says: The re
port of Brigadier General T. M. Ander
son, which, army men declare, severely
criticized Major General Otis' conduct
of the campaign in the Philippines,
will not be made public by the War
Department. It is in the possession of
Adjutant General Corbin, who declares
that it is of no public interest. These
ar^ the same tactics as those pursued
â¢.vith Colonel Roospvelt's report upon
the Santiago campaign.
General Anderson was in command
of the first division of the Eighth Army
Corps under General Otis, but was re
called and is now in command of the
Department of the Lakes at Chicago.
His brother officers say he Is a man
given to frank and vigorous declara
tions of his opinions, and they believe
that in his report he sets forth General
Otis' error in supposing that all the In
surgents were north of Manila, and
that once they were whipped the rebel
lion would be over. General Anderson,
it Is said, insisted that the province of
Cavite was full of Apruinaldo's men,
and that they should not be neglected.
The battles to the south of Manila
having proved the wisdom of his propo
sition the report has been suppressed.
The current Issue of the Army and
Navy says: "Where Is General Ander
son's report? It would appear from
what we can learn that General Ander-
Bon did not agree with General Otir, as
to the proper conduct of operations,
and as he Is accustomed to expressing
his opinions frankly he has no doubt
said so. Still it would Beem to be better
to make the report public."
GROWING DISCONTENT
IN AMERICAN ARMY
VANCOUVER. B. C, June 27. -Louis
La Dow, who recently arrived in Yoko
hama from Manila, Is quoted in late Jap
anese papers as having expressed the
conviction that the end of the war with
the Filipinos was by no means yet in
sight. The official reports of American
s, he said, were not wholly reliable,
as they made n<-> allowance for the num
bers who died in the hospital.
The number of Americans killed in bat
tles or who have died in the hospitals
since the outbreak of hostilities will he
thinks, easily roach 5000. The volunteer
- he regards as the flower of the
army of occupation, for their year's train
ing has made them as efficient as any
regulars in the world. Unfortunately the
more recent dispatches of reinforcements
are not nearly so good as the original
volunteers, who were not actuated by any
prospect of high pay but by patriotism or
love of adventure.
The later arrivals will require a good
deal of "licking Into shape." The original
army of occupation is not in a pleasant
frame of mind. It is, in the firm place
perfectly willing to fight against any
civilized power in ordinary warfare but
it objects to wasting lives and health
upon "niggers." as the soldiers con-
Jly call the Filipinos. The men
indulge In many growls at the necessity
which compels them to be on the 'â¢qtii
vive" day and night in order not to be
caught napping by their cunning enemies.
One feature of the war is that although
so many natives have been killed very
few weapons have been captured. The
moment a Filipino falls there are ten
others ready to snatch up his rifle and
make off with it. Their numerical re
sources are practically inexhaustible,
whereas the Americans can obtain fresh
men only after long delays and at groat
expense. It is a remarkable fact that al
though the American troops have often
remained in the trenches with soaked
'â¢lothing for days at a time they have
never caught cold.
NIGHT'S DEBAUCH
MAY END IN DEATH
As a Result of a Row, Dan Christy
of Fresno Is Seriously
Wounded.
FRESNO, June 27.â As a result of a
row in the tenderloin district at 4:30
this morning Dan Christy, otherwise
known as Dan Donnelly, will undoubt
edly die from a bullet wound he re
ceived In the abdomen.
Christy had been in the company of
a woman known as "Mac," who, he
claims, robbed him of his money. After
a wordy argument with the woman
Christy Jumped from the window of her
house and. seeing Jack Brooks on the
street, commenced shooting at him.
Brooks stepped into a saloon and, se
curing a revolver, fired a number of
shots at Christy.
Policeman Rice, who had arrived on
the scene, fired at Christy, the bullet
entering the small of Christy's back
and cutting the Intestines In two
places. The wounded man was remov
ed to the county hospital, where Dr.
Davidson removed the bullet. Christy
is about 24 years of age and has a
mother living in Ireland.
A late Investigation of the case
shows that the bullet which wounded
Christy was, in all probability fired by
Jack Brooks and not Officer Rice.
Brooks has been arrested on a charge
of assault to commit murder.

ACROSS CHINA
ON A BICYCLE
English Officer's Re
markable Trip.
ASTONISHED THE NATIVES
HIS WHEEL BEGABDED AS AN
INTEBNAL DEVICE.
Finally It Is Seized Upon and De
stroyed and He Completes His
Journey on a Camel's
Back.
Special IMsratoh to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C, June 27.âCap
tain Wingate of the Fourteenth Ben
gal Lancers of the Indian army has
Just completed a remarkable trip
across China, He â walked, wheeled and
rode on a camel's back for ten months,
making the trip from Shanghai, right
across the Yangtse Valley, through
Hunan and Thibet and as far as Ran
goon. The first part of the Journey
â was by far the most dangerous, as far
as the natives were concerned.
Captain "Wing-ate had great trouble
in conducting his cycling movements
without causing frequent riots among
the natives. On one occasion he en
tered a village and immediately was
surrounded by a big crowd of Chinese,
who thought the wheel was some
magic device that had come among
them. He succeeded in getting away i
: that time by "scorching," trusting to
I the astonishment of the natives as !
| proof against pursuit.
On another occasion he was unlucky
! enough to lose the wheel, for the na
tives in their anger destroyed it. He
was allowed to proceed unmolested and
1 gained a valuable Insight into the lives
jof the Chinese, especially a tribe of
! cave-dwellers, who lived on bats, rats
j and other small animal?.
On reaching the higher district of
! Hunan he found a great change, and he
! will recommend to tho Government
! that arrangements be made for the es
! tablishment of trading posts there.
The natives are large, strong-looking
and intelligent. As a matter of fact.
i they have, during recent years, filled
I almost all the ranks of the army. They
j have many tribal wars, but are always
: victorious over the hybrid nations sur
! rounding them. Their country has Im
mense pasture lands.
While passing through, Captain
Wlngate was unmolested, though the
i country Is reputed to contain the fiero
! est peode of the empire. They have
I frequently murdered missionaries, but
this was principally because the mis
sionaries had molested their arrange
! ments for the worship of their heathen
gods.
Captain "Wingate saw evidences of
cannibalism, particularly the eating of
the old people of th^ various tribes, in
nearly every village ho visited. He had
; great trouble in making the Journey
â¢ across Thibet. Thp natives there were
continually forbidding him to pass and
threatening to seize him. Yet he found
them, to a great extent, honorable peo
ple, and If they agreed to deliver him
provisions they would usually fulfill
their contracts. He bought sevoral now
camels on the trip. He was eight
months and eleven days in crossing
Hunan and Thibet. He thinks that
, there are vast possibilities for trade in
the country.
PHILIPPINE PORTS
OPENED TO TRADE
MANILA, June 2Â«.â Major General Otis :
has ordered the opening to trade of many ,
important ports which have been closed !
since the outbreak. These Include San |
Fernando, on the west coast of Luzon; !
Aparrl, on the north coast; Curimoa and
all ports In the islands of Samar and :
Leyte.
Many ships used In interlsland com
merce have been tied up in the harbor
here for months and the shippers and
merchants have been urging the Govern
ment to raise the blockade. When the de
cision was made known yesterday the
scene in the custom house was as ani
mated as the floor of an American stock
exchange. It was a busy day. Ship own
ers rushed to get their clearance papers.
There will be a great boom in the hemp
business, which has been at a standstill.
The ships will race to bring the first cargo
before the demand weakens. As there Is .
a heavy export duty on hemp, this will .
greatly increase the revenues. The in
terests of the natives, as well as the mer
chants and traders generally, led General
Otis to take this action. Delegates from
the southern Islands told him that the'
cessation of business was bringing much
suffering to peaceful Inhabitants.
Gunboats will protect the shipping in
some ports, but elsewhere shippers must
risk confiscation by the Insurgents, who
exact heavy tribute for all ships they per- <
mit to sail.
The rumor that Aguinaldo had been as
sassinated was in circulation here for
several days. It was not believed, but its
currency gave it a detinit*' form. Ac
cording to the story. General Pio del Pilar
called upon Aguinaldo on June 19 and ac
cused him of having caused General
I. una to be killed. Aguinaldo denied re
sponsibility, and added that he deeply re
gretted Luna's death. General Pio del I
Pilar, as the story goes, called him a liar
and scoundrel, shot him twice in the head ;
with his revolver and walked away un- \
molested.
The report finds no credence In Manila.
A Filipino general, mounted on a big
horse, with a numerous staff, has since
been seen haranguing the Filipino troops i
around San Fernando, in Panv anga (
Province, and this officer is supposed to be
Aguinaldo.
Yesterday four gnns of Hobbs' Battery â 
and other artillery bombarded the Fili- ,
pir.o blockhouses and trenches about two
miles north of San Fernando. The block- I
houses, which had been used by Filipino
sharpshooters to annoy the American out
posts, were destroyed. The enemy made
no resistance.
Yesterday the Spanish Consul "General,
wearing a brilliant uniform, visited Major
General Otis. He was received in the
latter's office, which is hung with por- .
traits of Spanish royal personages. Ir. the i
course of a graceful speech he said the .
Spaniards In the Philippines would hold !
no resentment because of the past and
would entertain no sentiment but that
of respect toward the new regime.
ALLEGED ELECTION FRAUDS.
Political Factions in Larkspur and
Corte Madera at War.
SAN RAFAEL, June 27.â Several politi- ;
cal factions In the towns of Larkspur and
Corte Madera are engrossed in the pleas
ant pastime of hurling charge? and re- '
criminations at one another. On June 2 a
school election was held at Corte Madera
there being several rival tickets In the
field. The "foreign element." as the old
timers term it. won, and William East
man, Harry de Veuve Jr. and James
Brown were chosen Trustees. J. A. Gard
ner has issued a signed circular declaring
the election to have been a fraud from
start to finish; that the law was openly
violated and that corruption was prac
ticed.
Yesterday District Attorney Mclsaac
waa visited by Gardner and Louis Yes- i
aria, both of whom denounced the work
of the "bosses" and announced their in- ;
tention to employ counsel to assist in |
prosecuting the alleged malefactors. All
the principals to the affair are prominent |
citizens.

PICKED UP WHEN COMPLETELY
EXHAUSTED.
Crew Had Previously Departed in th<3
Small Boats and All Are Taken
Aboard a Passing
Vessel.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILMINGTON, X. C, June 27.-The
George W. Clyde, Captain Roberts, of the
Xew York-Clyde line, arrived in this port
at 11 o'clock this morning with Captain
A. D. Ingram and crew of the steamer
Pawnee on board. The Clyde had picked
them up from small boats very soon after
they had abandoned the Pawnee, which
was desoroyed by fire off Curricull on
Sunday night. The fire was discovered
at about midnight and had gained such
headway that every effort to check it
was futile. The flames leaped in great
volume from the forward hold of the ves
sel and dense smoke completely en
veloped the deck.
When the alarm was sounded Captain
Ingrram was asleep. No sooner had he
rushed out and taken in the situation
than he saw that if he saved his crew n>^
must act at once. While the crew
was manning the small boats Captain In
gram rushed into his cabin for some
valuables, which he hoped to save. When
he reached the ships side the boat had
drifted out of reach and about that time
the smoke shifted so as to envelop tuat
side of the vessel. The captain ordered
the crew to row the boat to windward.
This the men did. but in the meantime the
wind shifted again, the heat and smoke
forcing the crew to pull away without
their captain. There were made three
vain efforts of this kind, the boat being
rowed to first one side of the vessel and
then the other in attempts to reach the
captain.
Finally Captain Ingram leaped into the
water and swam two hundred feet or
more, finally reaching a boat, completely
exhausted and almost unconscious.
In the meantime the George W. Clyde
had sighted the Pawnee in flames and
picked up the captain and crew within
a few minutes.
Captain Ingram says the Pawnee had a
full cargo, principally lumber. There was
also a quantity of cotton. She cleared
for Brunswick last Friday.
Quadruped With Bullet-Proof Body.
Dr. F. Moreno, the < 'ommissioner of the
Argentine Republic, who is now in this
country in connection with the arbitra
tion over the boundary dispute with Chile,
has brought with hini to London. I h.-..r.
a piece of thÂ° skin of the mysterious
quadruped which is said to exist in the
interior of the territory of Santa Cruz, in
Patagonia. According to the reports of
the Indians it is ;i strango creature, with
limner claws and a terrifying appearance,
impossible to kill because it has a bo ly
impenetrable alike to firearms and miss
iles. The pivce of skin which Dr. Moreno
has here fully confirms this description. I
am told by an expert who hns seen it.
and a close examination and study lead
to the conviction that the animal to which
the skin belonged was about the size of a
cow. This specimen will shortly be sen:
to the British Museum, but it may be
added that hopes are entertained that a
whole skin, with the skeleton, will before
long be obtained for the museum, slnc.j
this is one of the main objects of Harry
â¢ 'avendish's expedition to Patagonia.

CAPTAIN BIRLEM IS OUT
COMMISSARY WILKINSON ALSO
GETS HIS WALKING PAPERS.
A Number of Strangers, Friends of
the Governor, Loitering About
and Speculating as to Whose
Jobs They Will Take.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX QUEXTIX. June 27.â Warden
Agulrre has evidently changed his
mind about not making any radical
changes In the personnel of the officials
and guards. Lulled into a sense of se
curity by his oft-repeated statements
that only a few changes would be
made, the announcement to-day that
Captain Birlem and Commissary Wil
kinson had fallen under the political ax
came like a thunderbolt from a clear
sky. Three other appointments will
doubtless be made to-morrow, while, in
the expressive language of an aston
ished guard, "Enough of the Los An
geles push arrived to-day to keep
things humming for a week."
Last Saturday Captain Birlem was
told by Aguirre that no change was to
be made as regards the captaincy of
the g-uarda. To-day James R. Russell.
ex-Chief of Police of San Diego, was
taken to Birlem and introduced as his
successor. Xot only did Aguirre there
by show himself to be a star represen
tative of the method employed by his
political discoverers, but the language
he employed had a distinct Candelar
ian tint, being something like "Pack
up your duds and git." Captain Bir
lem was dumfounded, but accepted the
notification in a dignified and gentle
manly manner.
Commissary Thomas "Wilkinson was
also dismissed and his position filled by
Thomas F<>ley, the father of Gage's
private secretary.
Deputy Sheriffs H. C. McClure and
John Barnhill of Los Angeles are now
here and it is stated on good authority
that both will be given positions to
morrow. Barnhill will succeed Fred
Woods as front gatekeeper and Mc-
Clure will take the place of turnkey to
succeed J. C. Jamleson. It was com
monly expected that Captain of the
Yard Edgar would be succeeded by Mc-
Clure and the fact that Edgar is to re
main at least temporarily comes as a
surprise second only to the upheaval
itself.
Don Jose Aguirre, the "Warden's
brother, is also on hand, and none be
lieve for his health, though what of
ficial he will succeed is not known. It
is said that other residents of the Te
hachapl district will reach here to
morrow and be snugly placed. Even
the guards are alarmed at the south
ernizing process, and the prison this
evening is a scene of restlessness and
anxiety.

and more thorough test of their relative j
speed than that in the light air of Sunday, â 
and again the new boat proved that in j
windward work she could both outpoint i
:;nd outfoot tbe older er;Â»f!. Both boats [
carried main.-mii. forestay sail; Ib and

of time the .two use.! small jib top sails.
The steady southwest breeze was Just
Btrong enough to heel the boats prettily.
The racors beat to windward in a general
southwesterly direction for almost two j
hours and traveled ten miles toward ,
Hlock island from Blenton's Reef, and :
when she was eased off for the run back
the Columbia was between two and three
minutes in the Lead.
At 12:80 o'clock the Defender jibbed the
loom over to starboard. The wind began j
to die down about this time, and at 1 1
o'clock the helm was put amidshlp and
the Columbia's groat white spinnaker was
sent aloft. When everything was ready
a pull on the tackle broke out a couple of
stops, am' the wind, catching in the can
vas, spread the enormous sail for the first
time.
Despite the fact that the breeze had ;
fallen off considerably, the Columbia took
a jump and traveled along at tea knots an j

The spinnaker was ised but a few mm- i

VAPOR BATH EXPLODES
WITH FATAL RESULTS
Peculiar Accident Which Befell F. W.
Gardner of York
.. . . town.
SANTA ROSA, June 27.â Particulars
have just been received here of a
frightful accident -which befell F. M.
Gardner, a well-known resident of
Yorktown, Mendoplno County, at his
home a few days ago.
Several weeks since Mr. Gardner pur
chased an appliance to enable him to
take what is known as a "vapor bath."
The affair consists of a cabinet of rub
ber cloth which fastens tightly about
the neck, enveloping the entire body,
but leaving the head exposed.
On the day of the accident Mr. Gard
ner was using turpentine and water,
absorbing the vapor rising from the
heated mixture, when suddenly and
without any warning there was a loud
explosion and his naked body was en
veloped In flames. The heat was so in
tense that although subjected to It for
but a moment the man was horribly
burned about the body and limbs.
In some places great patches of flesh
have fallen away, exposing the bone.
At first it was thought that he could
not possibly recover, but his chances
are now said to be improving. He may
be crippled for life.

Special Dispatch to The Call
POrOHKEEPSIE. N. T., June 27.-
Twpnty thousand persons to-day saw one
of the most exciting four-mile boat races
over witnessed in the history of college
rowing. Five thousand spectators on the
observation train veiled themselves hoarse
in frantic appeals to th<!r various college
crews to do their best, and. with the
other 15,000. they saw the red and blue
carried over the line a winner by a short
half length from the Wisoonsins, who lost
In the last 200 yards by bad steering. Cor
nell, the victor of former years, came
third, fully four lengths In the rear, and
Columbia, newr in the light after the end
Of the first mile, trailed a good three
lengths In the stern of the Cornell boat.
It whs the kind of a race that makes
the blood tingle and was made so by the
crew that came over a thousand miles to
meet former victors, for without the gal
lant "Wlsconslns In the race it would have
been a doleful procession after the second
mile was entered. To say there was sur
prise on the observation train and amid
ill* great crowd on the banks when thÂ«
Wisconsin shell swept mile after mile of
the course until the last half was reached
with a clear lead over all the crews is
putting It mildly. When the people on
the. bank, unable to place the strange
crew, looked toward the observation train
inquiringly and were told that It was Wis
consin they were almost dumb with
amazement, and when those on the train
saw the gallant struggle mile after mile
they dropped their appeals for their own
crews and yelled In a friendly manner for
the boys from the West.
The alleged ragged stroke, the badly
keeled boat, the too-long reach all wero
forgotten as the fast-moving shell kept
its sharp nose to the fore, and then tnu
people saw the leaders turn, out toward
the short at the finish and lose the race
in the men from Pennsylvania by a short
half ler.Kth.
Well did the Pennsylvanians obey the
injunction of Ellis Ward to not lose their
heads. From the first eighth of a mile
they rowed a hard stern chase, at one
time being astern of both Cornell and
Wisconsin, but their pluck and enduram â¢
Bent them over the line first In good
time and by such a small margin that
ihe glory is greater.
For Cornell, the winner of many bat
tles, the contest proved to be a race only
in two miles. For those first two miles
she did gallant work, but she was strug
gling against evidently better crews, ami
it was only by exertions of a phenomenal
nature that she managed to keep the nose
of the boat ahead of Pennsylvania, for a
brief time in the second mile. Columbia
was 'outclassed, from the start.
At the start Cornell had the channel
course, where the advantage Is said to
lie, with Columbia next to her, and then
came Pennsylvania, with Wisconsin clos.).
In to the shore. It was rather pitiful to
hear the three Eastern crews get cheer
after cheer and the Western crew not any.
Two false starts were made. The third
was a beautiful one, the four boats' noses
seeming to hang together for the first two
strokes. As they settled in the stroke
taught thorn by the various coaches Wis
consin seemed to be rowing the least
number of strokes per minute of any of
the crews, but her boat was going faster
than any of the others. Wisconsin rowed
32, Pennsylvania 34, Cornell 34 and Colum
bia 33. Before the first eighth of a mile
was finished the Wisconsin boat ha I
shoved its nose, ahead of the. other, crews,
with Cornell second, Pennsylvania hang
ing well on to her and Columbia fourth,
dropping astern. â  ;.â¢>',*.'iâ¢;â¢
\\ hen the first half mile was reached
so fast was the Wisconsin boat going that
it had taken its whole length ahead of the
Pennsylvania boat and was a half-length
ahead of the Cornell boat. On the extreme
east, Columbia was coming with the nose
of her boat just overlapping Pennsyl
vania. Frantically the Pennsylvania
rooters on the train yelled at their crew
and the Quakers seemed to respond, as
In a few minutes they shot their boat up
even with the Cornell boat, but to catch
Wisconsin was not so easy.
On a perfectly even keel, with the
bodies going well back together and tho
heads seeming as if they would swine
off the shoulders, a feature that seemed
to make the critics believe that they
would go to pieces after the first mile,
the Wisconsin crew flew on. When the
mile was reached the. Wisconsin boat had
a lead of a clear length of Pennsyl
vania, while Cornell and Pennsylvania
were see-sawing for second place. The
Wisconsin crew had settled down to a
stroke of 32 to a minute, the boat never
checking between the strokes and the
blades cutting the water as keenly as a
knife. The slow recovery and the slow
stroke had behind It a wonderful power
and the Wisconsin boat never checked or
stopped as It went toward the second
mile.
In the meantime Pennsylvania and Cor
nell were having as pretty a fight for
second place as ever has been seen on the
course. Time and time again the Cornell
crew put a little more back in the stroke
and sent the nose of their boat even with
that of the Quakers, but It was quite ap
parent that there was little chance of
their holding it there.
When the Wisconsin crew had reached
the mile nnd a quarter point it eased off
a trifle In Its stroke, rowing for two or
three minutes at 31. At the same time
Cornell picked up Its stroke and shoved
its boat's nose- slightly ahead of Penn
sylvania and overlapping the stern of the
Wisconsin shell. "Cornell, I yell," came
from thousands of throats on the obser
vation train and the hope arose that the
Cornell crew was going to the front in
its usual style. But with apparent ease
the Wisconsin stroke went back to its
regular 32 and the boat shot ahead again
a good half length. At the some time,
Pennsylvania's boat, which had been lag
ging a half length behind Cornell, shot
up level with Cornell's boat, while Co
lumbia, making a desperate effort, place.l
the nose of their shell near Pennsylva
nia's stern. x
Passing the three and a quarter miles
point Pennsylvania hit the stroke up to
thirty-five and there began one of the
most exciting contests ever seen in boat
racing. Slowly the bowman of the Penn
sylvania boat lined up with the cockswain
in the Wisconsin's "boat, but just' as he
had come up on a line with him the Wis
consin crew responded to the spurt and
drew their boat away.
It was at this point that "Wisconsin was
seen to swerve badly toward the western
shore, and to the surprise of everybody
maintained this course, although It took
the boat inside of a number of small
pleasure boats and fully GOO yards out of
their course at the finish. Naturally, the
Pennsylvania boat gained upon the Wis
consin boat, and as they passed into the
last quarter the noses of the shells were
on a line. The Wisconsin boat, unable to
turn back into its lane, had found dead
water near the shore, and. pull as Wis
consin would and as desperately as it did,
the nose of the Pennsylvania shell came
out inch by inch until It crossed the line
a scant half length ahead of the Badgers'
boat. : -;-.
Official summary: Pennsylvania's time
20:04: Wisconsin's, 20:05^; Cornell's. 20:13;
j Columbia's, 20:20. The record for this
course Is 19:29.

Remove the Ban.
LEASHMEN STILL HAVF FAITH
A WEEK'S DEVELOPMENTS ARE
AWAITED WITH INTEREST.
Oincials of the Park Are Ready to
Resume the Sport as Soon as
Permission Cm Be
Outlined.
The action of the Supervisors In pass
ing to print an amended ordinance repu
lating the sport of coursing within the
limits of this county has given the leash
men renewed hope. For some months it
has been a case of hope deferred, but the
men interested have not lost heart.
The directors of Ingleside Courslnjf
Park expressed the opinion yesterday
that the ordinance granting them the
right to course sixty days in the year
would be finally passed at the next meet
ing of the Supervisors. Should such ac
tion be taken coursing would' be resumed
at Ingleside with as little delay as pos
sible. P. J. Reilly would be in tha saddle,
OS judge, while Harry Murray; would be
slipper. Both men: have been identified
with the sport in " various capacities for
some years.
. Under the ordinance presented by Su
pervisor Collins there could be courting
every Sunday in the year and also on the
principal holidays.
Los Angeles will send the beat It has
to Union Park next Saturday for the big
midsummer meeting. Smith and Day
den's Mountain Belle and Little Fairy
will represent the South, being pitted
against the crack dogs of this district.
Mountain Belle has performed here be
fore, being a starter for the John Grace
cup. She did not run up to her form
and her owner blamed the long journey
on the train. This time he will bring her
up in advance and will have no excuses
to offer on the score of condition.
The customary weekly draw will be
held at Pythian Castle to-night. The
Fourth of July stake will probably bo
drawn at the park Saturday.

ALL TICKET SCALPERS
MUST QUIT BUSINESS
LOCAL PASSENGER AGENTS
MEET AND ORGANIZE.
Will Send a Committee East Next
July to Capture the Epworth
League Convention for
California.
Yesterday morning the San FrancUco i
Passenger Agents' Association held their I
second meeting and formally organized. !
L. H. Countiss uiis elected chairman to ;
preside until next January, when the lirst
regular annual election will be held. jMr.
Countiss will nominate a secretary, who
will be voted upon at the next meeting
of the association. These two officers
will be the only ones the organization
will provide itself with, as all business
not coming under their jurisdiction will
be attended to by committees appointed
as the occasion may arise.
The purposes of the association aro
primarily ihe, conservation and preserva
tion of revenue, the doing away with rate i
cutting, ticket scalping and kindred evils i
and to centralize power so that influence i
enough can bo wielded to make the rail- !
loud power of the coast felt in compe
tition with the East in securing the pro
portion of general travel, excursions and
conventions that rightfully belong to Cal
lfornia.
The association yesterday decided on
an organized effort to do away ' with
ticket scalping. Heretofore it has boon 1
the custom of many of the roads to wink !
at the practice so long as they them
selves were not injured. This resulted in
greatly shaking the confidence of the :
Kastern roads, over which many special !
rate tickets were sold, and had much to
do with their opposition to special ratea ,
proposed with the view of inducing dif- :
fer^nt large organisations to hold their
conventions in this State.
The association also decided to send a '
committee to Indianapolis next July to j
see if the Epworth League convention
cannot be secured for California. If the
committee is successful in its efforts, he
tween fifteen and twenty thousand people !
will come here next summer, bringing
with them all the increase of business :
that usually follows such large numbers '
of excursionists.

offensive breath (fle. 3). pains or aches in
joints (fig. 4. .ii. palpitation of heart (fig. ft)
impaired digestion (fig. 7), inactive (torpid)'

What 1? war before battle but the massing
together of engines to kill men? What is It
during battle but men dealing death blows
while the ground drinks blood and corpses
lie thick as autumn leaves? What Is It after
battle but the sending of grief throughout the
land which nothing can assuage?
fc'hnull not humanity do all in Its power to ',
stop this shame to humanity? Two thousand
years after the angels sang out "Peace on
Karth'" there are wars. Let meetings be held
In every nation beneath the sun and let men
say they are the patriots of patriots, who
seek to save lives of men. Let justice reign
and let It go forth from this great city of
London to-night a message to the world, that
Justice is reigning and that peace universal
will be secured.
The speech was received with great en
thusiasm.
Mrs. Mary Wright Sewall. vice presi
dent of tho council, speaking upon the
resolution, said:
When the war cloud? settled down upon
the United States every one asked what would
become of the National Peace Council. The
press did not suppress Its jeers, but we con
sidered the declaration of war a trumpet call
to us to be up and doing. We felt a greater
need than ever. We never thought war a pos
sibility, and we are surprised at our mistake.
PrÂ»?sldent MeKlnley accepted our appeal. Our
action was not an impeachment of our Gov
ernment, but an example to help all Govern
ments, an example which can only be obtained
from women.

commememt'nt pxt-rcis>--s of the Col- .
lepe of Notre Dame were held this |
mtirnlng, commencing at 9 o'clock,
before a large gathering of the parents of
the pupils and friends of the school. The
programme, which consisted chiefly of
musical numbers, was one of the best of
the kind ever hoard in this city. The

great credit upon tho painstaking pist>rs

and in the audience were many mothers
of the pupils, who had come to pay horn- .
age to their own alma mater.

with smilax, exergreens and the national
colors, and in the background were six
pianos, which were used in presenting the
musical selections and choruses. Potted
plants and fresh flowers from the flour
ishing gardens that surround the college
completed the decorations.
The several groupings of the elappos,
each member attired in white, made an
impressive scene. The clergy of the dio
cese occupied seats of honor near the
stage.
The graduates who received diplomas
conferring collegiate honors and who were
crowned with wreaths from the hands of
the Rt. Rev. Bishop Grace, were: Miss
Mary Kelly and Miss Ella McGuire. The
first named young lady read an essay en
titled "Respice Finem," and Miss Mc-
Guire also read a paper, her subject being
"Perseverando." Both acquitted them
selves creditably, proving that they fully
deserve the high honors they received to
day. I

FRANK SOMERS
STILL IN HIDING
Believed He Has Taken
to the Hills.
NEVADA CITY, June 27.â Chris Gail
hraith, the victim of Frank Somers'
; bloodthirsty enmity, is having a sorry
time uf it. His face is swollen out of
shape and discolored till his nearest
; friends can hardly pee a familiar look
i about it. One eye is shut and he can
! see but little out of the other. He is
enduring all sorts of pain. His wife
i came down to-day from their home at
j the Central House and will remain here
! for the present.
The wonder to those who claim to be
familiar with the circumstances that
led up to Sunday's fracas is that Gail
braith did not go gunning for the gray
young lothario many months ago in
stead of simply warning him to keep
away from his hearthstone. The offi
cers all agree that it is a scandalous
affair, and intimate that if Somers is
caught and brought to trial there will
come to the surface a rare sensation.
The question to-day is, is the fugitive
still on the Washington Ridge, or has
he followed the example of Murderer
Moore and fled the county? The ridge
is an ideal hiding place for a criminal.
It is three or more miles wide, extend
ing from Deer Creek to the South Yuba
River, and is more than three times as
long. Most of it is heavily timbered
and there are innumerable almost bot
tomless canyons, deserted mining tun
nels and other places where a hunted
man could rest secure from detection.
There are not more than fifty or sev
enty-five people In the entire section,
and they are too busy with their own
affairs, such as mining, wood chopping
and other peaceful pursuits, to bother
their heads much in stalking offenders
against the law. It would be easy for
Somers to elude officers by staying
there.
A report was circulated here to-day
that Somers had sent word through his
brother Tom that he would surrender
if the Sheriff himself went up there
after him, but neither Brother Tom nor
Sheriff Getchell have heard anything
of it. In fact, Tom freely expresses
the opinion that his wayward young
kinsman has already reached the limit
of "indiscretion," and that the best
thing he can do is to give himself up
and face the music.
The Somers boys used to live on
Water street in this city. Their parents
died when they were young and they
were sent to the Orphan Asylum at
Grass Valley, where they remained for
some time.

QUESTION OF WAR
TAX RAISED AGAIN
One More Suit Against
Wells, Fargo & Co.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, June 27.â Thompson, Beard &
Sons, proprietors of a large mercantile
establishment, have undertaken, through
their attorneys. Webber & Rutherford
of this place, the task of compelling the
Wells-Fargo Express Company to pay
the internal revenue tax on the packages
it handles. The plaintiffs ask that a writ
of mandate be issued ordering the defen
dants to receive and deliver a certain
package in question.
The plaintiffs, as a California corpora
tion carrying on business in Napa, allege
that the defendant, being a common car
rier, are In duty bound to receive and
carry packages offered to them, giving
in return for same receipts with internal
revenue stamps affixed; that the plain
tiffs on June 15. IM)9, tendered to defen
dants a package for delivery, whereupon
defendant unlawfully and extortionau-ly
demanded of plaintiffs, in addition to
their regular lawful charge of 25 rents,
1 cent extra to cover cost of a revenue
stamp. That it is not now and never
has neen the duty of plaintiffs to pay
such revenue, and that plaintiffs would
not comply. Thereupon defendant refused
to carry the package to its destination.
That in the course of their business tno
plaintiffs are constant shippers of goods
and that unless they comply with the un
lawful and extortionate demand of the
defendant they will be forced to forego
shipments, to their irreparable detriment,
damage and injury.
Mr. Beard, of Thompson. Beard & Sons,
said in talking to a Call representative
to-day that he objected to paying the
revenue tax when first demanded by the
company more than a year ago, and, be
ing a large shipper, the company had
agreed to pay it. The agreement was
kept up to a month ago, when fche com
pany asked Mr. Beard to pay it. H.Â»
refused, and hence the suit. Messrs.
"Webber and Rutherford, attorneys for
the plaintiffs, filed the writ of mandate
on June IS in the Superior Court of Napa
County. Judge Ham of that court signed
the alternative writ on June 19 and served
the same on Aaron & Stein, defendant.,
representatives in San Francisco. The
alternative writ was made returnable on
July 3, 1899. and on that date the suit
will begin. Messrs. Webber and Ruther
ford are young lawyers of ability, deter
mined to win, and on behalf of their cli
ents will fight It to the last. A case sim
ilar to this is Fitzgerald vs. Wells-Fargo
Express Company, now pending in the
Superior Court of Snn Francisco, brought
there from the United States Circuit
Court on a question of original Jurisdic
tion, and the final settlement of the ques
tion rests on the decision of these two
cases.

English Toleration of
Roman Catholics.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, June 27.â The Duke of Nor
folk, Premier Duke, hereditary Marshal
and Chief Butler of England, presided to
day at a special meeting of the Catholic
Union Society of Great Britain, convened
to hear an address by Archbishop
Ireland.
Baron Clifford of Chudleigh, Count of
the Holy Roman Empire, and* all the
Catholic nobility in London were present.
A letter was read from Cardinal Vaughan,
Archbishop of Westminster, expressing
the hope that the Catholic Church in,
England would become more closely al
lied to the Catholics of the United States.
He referred to the generosity of the
American people when he founded the
Catholic mission at Mtllhill, and said that
America first received missionaries from
here to the negro race. The future, in his
judgment, seemed to indicate even a more
intimate friendship between the two na
tions than had existed in the past.
Archbishop Ireland expressed his
pleasure at having an opportunity to ad
dress some of the greatest hereditary
families of England who had distinguished
themselves in science, art and literature.
The liberty granted by England to Rinnan
Catholicism would, he believed, greatly
influence the nations of the world, who
would imitate ht-r action in this question;
and her t-xnmple would thus be the means
of extending the church of Rome through
out the world.
Referring to the cordial relations be
tween Great Kritain and the United
States, the Archbishop said he hoped this
friendship would increase as the years
passed â a sentiment which was received
with hearty cheers.
Bishop Thomas O. Gorman of Sioux
Falls and the Bishop of Emmaus,
Palestine, were among those who listened
to the address.
MRS. LEIBBRANDT DID
ALL THE PROPOSING
Testimony of Jean Sorg in the
Breach of Promise
Suit.
SAN JOSE. June 27.â The taking of tes
timony was completed to-day in the $50,-
I 000 breach of promise suit of Mrs. Bertha
| Leibbrandt, the Santa Cruz widow, who
demands this sum from Jean Sorg, the
Arizona miner, who, she claims, failed to
I keep his promise of marriage.
Mrs. Leibbrandt was cross-examined
this morning. She stuck to her story
that Sorg had proposed marriage and she
accepted. Also that she began to dispose
, of her personal effects in order to carry
out her part of the contract.
Mrs. Elizabeth Wencks testified that
Mrs. Liebbrandt told her Sorg had prom
. ised to marry her. E. L. 'Wencks. Mrs.
"VYencks" husband. gave similar testimony.
â  M. E. Bankley and Mrs. M. McNamafa
gave testimony along the same lints.
Mrs. W. Pieruoques was the first wit
ress called for defense. She knew Mrs.
I,elbbrandt well. The plaintiff had told
her S'jrg had asked her to live with him
as his wife, but she had never heard her
say Sorg proposed to her.
Jean Sorg, the defendant, was the next
witness. He did not use very good En
glish and his funny answers pro% - oked
much merriment. He admitted he had
spt-nt much of his time in Santa Cruz
in Mrs. Iveibbrandt's company, but had
never proposed to the widow. On the
contrary, plaintiff did all the proposing;
in fact, every day she asked him
to marry her. He contradicted Mrs.
T.eibbrandt's statement that there had
been any Improper relations between
them. Witness stated he was married
last October in San Francisco and had a
grown son and daughh .â¢ by a former
wife. He told plaintiff repeatedly that he
did not wish to marry her. but she kept
on proposing and seemed determined to
have him. He pitied the woman and sev
eral times gave her sums of money be
cause she was kind to him. He was go
ing to take up a mortgage for her at one
time, but on investigation found it was
not a safe investment. After he left San
ta Cruz she wrote to him for money, but
hf paid no attention to the letters. She
.ilko came to San Jose and demanded
money from him and threatened to sue
for breach of promise if he refused. This
closed the testimony. The case will go
to the jury to-morrow.
CANADIANS BRING IN
A COUNTER PROPOSAL
This Makes the Boundary Question
Seem as Far From Settlement
as Ever.
WASHINGTON. June 27.â The negotia
tions for a modus vivendi regulating the
Alaskan boundary have fallen into a
state that jeopardizes a successful out
come and causes apprehension among of
ficials. Nothing ,has been heard from
Embassador ('hoate as to the results of
the conference he had to-day with Lord
Salisbury on this subject, but the last
phase of the case was that the Cana
dians had come back with a counter pro
posal in place of accepting the definite
American proposition, which had been
carefully drawn with the sole purpose of
preventing any future controversy over
the points already agreed upon between
Choate and Lord Salisbury.
Instead of following the lines of the
American proposal and confining the
counter proposal to a plain statement of
the points already roughly indicated as
marking the boundary, this last issue pro
posed a radical change in the line on the
Dalton trail and was of a character
wholly unacceptable to the American side,
involving as it did the transfer into Ca
nadian jurisdiction of the fortunes and
claims of many American miners. Un
less there is a decided abatement on one
side or the other of the demands the de
sired modus will be as unlikely of attain
ment as was the permanent agreement on
the boundary question and the chances
for a reassembling of the joint high com
mission will fade away entirely.
AMERICAN IMPERIALISM.
It Will Be Discussed at the Annual
Pacific Grove Gathering.
PACIFIC GROVE, June 27.â The reg
ular annual midsummer reunion of pro
fessional and literary men of the Pa
cific Coast will open at this place July
4, continuing through to the 7th.
The reunion is a yearly gathering of
public m.^n for the purpose of discuss
ing in a semi-formal way vital ques
tions of the day. This year the general
theme will be "American Imperialism,"
subdivided into four special subjects â
"Greater America," "The Hawaiian An
nex," "the Philippine Annex" and "The
Porto Rican Annex" â a day being de
voted to each subject.
George Clifford, president of the Pa
cific Grove Retreat Association, will
preside, and the questions will be disÂ«
cussed from all standpoints by eminent
Pacific Coast thinkers.

TRAGIC DEATH
OF ANDREW MARKS
Killed His Wife and Then
Himself.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, June 27.â News
was brought by the steamer Empress
of China of the tragic death of Andrew
Marks, a San Francisco man who went
to Manila on one of the transports sail
ing out of the Golden Gate, and the Ma
nila woman who but seven days before
the tragedy he made his wife.
Marks, who was 41 years of age, made
a living as a cook to the army officers,
but in company with a Filipino woman,
to whom he was married, he deserted
them last May and went to Hongkong.
On arriving at Hongkong he estab
lished a restaurant, he being the cook
and his wife, whose maiden name was
Tairade, the waitress. On May 27,
seven days after the wedding, they
quarreled, and the woman left Marks
and took refuge in the house of a coun
tryman of hers. When Marks discov
ered her Might he followed and trace!
her to the house of a Filipino. The
owner of the house was not in, a Chi
nese servant being in charge of the
place. Marks pushed his way past him
and went upstairs.
He found his wife lying on the floor
of one of the rooms, and seizing her by
the hair he yanked her to her feet.
Then drawing a revolver he put a bul
let through her heart and another into
her brain. Then turning the revolver
on himself he placed it behind his ear
and almost blew the top of his head
off. He fell dead across the lifeless
body of his Filipino wife. Letters from
Consul Wildman and the marrlape li
cense were found in Marks' pocket.

NEWS FROM VOLUNTEERS.
SIXCPI military operations began in the unde
clared war against the Filipinos the rigid cen
sorship maintained by General Otis has been so
effective that the American people are not in posses
sion of the real facts of that distant situation, except
as given in the letters of volunteers. These letters
reach the general public only through their publica
tion, usually in some country paper. Hence it is that
the real current history of the far war is being pub
lished i:i papers all over lowa, Kansas, Nebraska.
â  Dakota, Minnesota, Idaho. Washington and else
: where in the States which have volunteers in the field.
The collection of these letters to make a connected
story is impossible, but each is complete in its narra
tive and furnishes the truth, which is rigidly excluded
from the official nnd censored news.
Private Smith of the Fifty-first lowa writes under
date of May 7, and we find his letter in the State
â  Press, published in lowa City. The editor takes pains
â  to state that he omitted the must serious parts of it.
so that, after all, what appears has passed a censor.
Private Smith says:
"As the American line advances soldiers mu*t be
left in the r ear to guard, thus weakening the fighting
fi rce as each advance is made. Our boys have to
charge every trench, only to find themselves outrun
and the native army far in advance. Every native
man, woman and child in the islands is a soldier, and
they wage a furious running fight As a rule they
are poor shots, or our army would have been de
stroyed long ago. Should the natives keep up the
1 pace much longer the American army will be in bad
pc, as many of the men are sick from the oppres
sive heat and fever. Whenever a man drops out of
the American army it means an idle rifle, while, on the
: other hand, the enemy always has some one ready to
fill up the gap made by the bullets of our soldiers.
"The volunteers are being pushed to the front, as
are supposed to be coming home soon, and some
of the regulars remain around Manila. When this
island is once under control there are two more that
must be taken in exactly the same manner, and it will
require a hundred thousand troops to hold them.
The United States sized these people up too cheaply,
and. though the military officers said they had them
whipped two months ago. the fact of the matter is
â¢ the enemy is as strong as ever. We are losing
force on the tiring line every day. and the more ter
ritory we take the greater the force required to hold
the ground. After getting beyond reach of the gun
boats on the bay our force is weakened to a great ex
tent in each skirmish. The rainy season is just start
ing and it pours to beat the band, so if more volun
teers come they will like the place! Any place
would be a paradise compared to this hole, and I
i think the United States will get good and sick of this
, expansion business before they get through with it.
It will cost us ten millions to get this one island un- i
(\i control. The natives have better arms than our
: ers. and their Mausers kill twice as far as our
Springfield-. We have to stand their fire until within
charging distance, and then they fall back. I have
-1 1 n men in our army pulling artillery and mules
standing in the shade, the officers being afraid the
mules would be killed. These high officers stay a mil?
in the rear and send an orderly with an order for as
to charge, and then they get all the praise."
Xo comment i- needed. The volunteers are citizens
; and look beyond the day's tight and measure the fu
; ture.
In the Dcs Moines Leader of June 11 is a letter
, from Mrs. Kitty Loper. wife of the colonel of the [
Fifty-first lowa. It is written from the hospital sta
tion on Corregidor Island. The lady says:
"'The prospect now is that we may reach home some
time this fall, possibly sooner. If they do not send
our volunteer regiments home soon there will only be
a handful to go homo, they are so rapidly succumbing
ickness and fighting. You mothers at home may
a- well know that your hoys are in constant danger
and be prepared for the worst if it come. This war :
! in the Philippines is not so flowery as it is pictured to
i you at home. You get only one side of it. the other :
i being concealed by those high in command. The '
i lives of our brave boys are being constantly sacrificed
to add to the laurels of those same high officers. As :
; I heard one of the colonels say the other day, they i
arc killing our volunteers in attempting to accom- !
in a few weeks what will take years to accom
plish."
The last sentence of that letter may well be studied. !
The imperialists have been in such a hurry to get
! in and grasp the profits of conquest and get the
salaried places which will so abound in the civil and ;
military administration required by our subjects that
they have led the Government into a serious piece of i
i business without adequate preparation. It was said j
recently that when the volunteers return they will be i
, missionaries for imperialism, and will insist on hold
ing the beautiful islands they have conquered. But
| the volunteers are not children who wish to play with j
' a venomous snake just because it is pretty. They are
: American citizens of full stature, and have ideas about

THE SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE SESSION-
THE intention of the Huntington monopoly, act
ins through its obedient servitor. Governor
Gage, to have an extraordinary session of the
, Legislature called, in order that its much worn chattel,
: Daniel M. Burns, may be elected to the Federal Sen
; ate. was fully disclosed in The Call of yesterday. The
omplishment. of this nefarious design against the
welfare and the respectability of the State, through
a gubernatorial appointment, has been appar
! ently abandoned. The interesting question now is
whether, under the law. the new scheme can suc
ceed.
Precedents for the election of a Federal Senator for
a full term at a special legislative session, when at a
regular session the joint convention failed to elect,
may exist, but. if so. such examination as The Call
has been enabled to make has failed to discover them.
A reference to applicable constitutional and statu
tory provisions is apparently conclusive against the
existence of the power. The reason for the disability
of the State executive to appoint under article I. sec
tion 3, of the Federal constitution, is because the term
of Stephen }Â£â¢ White expired March 3, 1809, while
the Legislature was in regular session and actually
engaged in voting for his successor, and, therefore,
there was no vacancy within the meaning of the sec
tion. If -a vacancy for some cause other than the
expiration of a term by limitation had been created
after the Legislature adjourned, then the Governor
could have appointed for the unexpired remainder of
the term, subject to the elective right of the Legis
lature, either in special or regular session, to sup
! plant the temporary appointee. The statutory law on
this subject is quite clear, and it seems equally clear
against the power which Mr. Huntington now desires
to usurp.
A$ Judge Story has observed in his "Commentaries
on the Federal Constitution," that instrument did not
prescribe in what manner Federal Senators should be
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 28, 1899.
j chosen by State Legislatures. The procedure was
j confided to the States, subject to the enactment of a
! controlling law by Congress, under article I, section
; 4. of the Federal constitution, such as was actually
! passed July 25. 1866. This statute does not change
the provisions of our Political Code, which, by section
1332, declares that elections for Senators in Congress
for FULL terms must be held "at the REGULAR
session of the Legislature next preceding the com
mencement of the term to be filled, " and. by section
1332. that VACANCIES shall be filled by election
"at the SESSION of the Legislature next succeeding
the occurrence of such vacancy." The discrimination
here evident is carried out by the Revise-d Statutes of
the United States, which, under title 11, chapter 1,
' provides, as in the Political Co<!e. that the Legisla
ture "chosen" next preceding the expiration of a full
I Senatorial term to be filled shall proceed to elect on
the second Tuesday after its organization, or, when a
vacancy occurs pending the regular session, then on
the second Tuesday after organization and notice. An
independent section, a? in the Political Code, ap
'. plies to other vacancies.
It Follows that the same discrimination between full
nnd unexpired terms and between regular and other
legislative sessions is recognized both by Congress
and by the State, and, therefore, as an original ques
tion at least, that the power of the Legislature at an
extraordinary session to elect at all for a full term,
that is, where no vacancy exists, is extremely doubt
ful. But there is no doubt whatever that the Gov
ernor has no power to convene the Legislature for
t lie purpose of electing a Federal Senator. It has
been frequently held that such an election is not a
legislative act. Our State constitution of 1849, by
article V, section 0. permitted the Governor to con
vene the Legislature by proclamation, and, when as
sembled, to state the purposes of his action. But the
constitution of 1870. article V, section 9. disposed of
this generality and declares that the executive may,
"on extraordinary occasions, convene the Legislature
by proclamation, stating the purposes for which he
has convened it. and. when so convened, it shall have
no power to LEGISLATE on any subjects other
than those specified in the proclamation."
The condition of the Federal Senatorship is ex
actly as the regular session of the Legislature left it.
No "extraordinary" or other "occasion" has since
arisen. And the executive can only convene the Leg
islature for its law-making business. Therefore, if
Governor Gage should attempt to work out the rail
road design to elect Dan Burns by means of a procla
: mation, his act would be void on its face. If he makes
the effort by creating some extraordinary legislative
i occasion, as no "vacancy" e\istÂ«. it is most doubt
in! whether in that manner the fraud could be legally
consummated.
The contortions of the heavenly twins, under the
high pressure of railroad steam, are agile, but gro
tesque.
THE COMING YACHT RACE.
REPORTS of the two yacht?, the Columbia and
the Shamrock, which have l>een constructed to
contest with one another the possession of the
famous America's cup, afford a striking evidence of
the value of such contests in improving the art of
yacht building. At each successive race the compet
ing yachts have been better and fleeter than those of
. the one which preceded it. The Defender, which won
! the match against the Valkyrie, was supposed to he
very near perfection in the way of a racing yacht, but
the Columbia, just launched, has in a trial trip walked
away from her with comparative ease.
The Shamrock has not yet been tested, but she was
launched on Monday, and the experts who saw her
are sanguine she will prove to be the best racing yacht
ever built in a British shipyard. A great secret has
neen made of her construction, and even her dimen
! *ions have not yet been authoritatively made public.
: Her owner. Sir Thomas Lipton, is a self-made man
: ot vast wealth, who does not count the cost nor hag-
J g!e over expense on any enterprise on which he has set
â  his heart, and we may be sure that whatever British
1 ingenuity could device for making the Shamrock per
fect has been done. Nothing has been spared any
where because of a lack of funds.
It was the intention of the challenger that the
Shamrock should be built in an Irish shipyard, but all
of them were too busy to undertake it. The yacht,
therefore, is Irish in name only. It is said by those
who saw her when she was about to be launched that
never before was such a beautiful, such a perfectly
modeled specimen of a racer constructed in the three
kingdoms, and British experts are reported to be san
guine of winning the trophy for which they have so
often contested in vain. â¢
Such being the excellencies of the two yachts, it <>
probable we are to have the excitement of the great
est race in the history of the world. Moreover, it
promises to be carried out in a thoroughly sportsman
like way. free from all the wrangles which made the
last contest so unpleasant to all concerned. The
success of the Columbia in beating the Defender on
'. her trial trip encourages the hope that the trophy will
remain with us. If we should lose it, however, the
loss would not be for long. A prompt challenge
would go to the winner, and American skill would set
itself to the task of improving on the Columbia as
much as the Columbia has improved on the Defender.
THE PRESS AND THE FAKER.
NJ OT in San Francisco only, but throughout the
j State, has there been an expression of
popular indignation against the faker who, be
cause his son has been successful in the prize-ring,
has undertaken to profit by the notoriety in the
career of a street preacher.
In commenting upon the subject the Riverside En
terprise says: "We can agree with the San Francisco
Call that the worst faker yet is the reverend father of
Jim Jeffries. He is leading a soul-saving crusade in
San Francisco and advertising the business by the un
savory renown of his jaw-jamming son."
The Placerville Nugget is equally strong in its con
demnation and says: '"It is indeed an extreme case
of the many cranky notions and foolish assertions
which help to offend and antagonize the decent sense
and feeling of many people. Mr. Jeffries Sr. should
take to the hills and find a hole."
These are illustrations of the general sentiment of
the people of all parts of California on the subject,
and furnish proof that the faker will not be successful
in his efforts to "elevate the pulpit" on his lines in
any community of the State. Clearly there is a limit
to the endurance of the public. There are some
things which even the wide toleration of Californians
will not support.
The Due d'Orleans crashed himself into a brick
wall the other day and was severely battered. He cer
tainly ought to be accustomed to the sensation after
so many tilts against the brick wall of French repub
licanism.
A Los Angeles character, who began life as a
sheepherder and won wealth by unremitting energy,
has died in poverty and disgrace. He probably over
looked the road taken by Governor Gage.
BERKELEY WILL ADD HER SHARE
TO THE DEWEY STATUE FOND
Captain William H. Marston, President of the Board of Trustees
Berkeley.
BERKELEY is the latest city to swing Into line for the Dewey mon
ument, and with its well-known reputation for aiding in public
matters it will not be behind its sister cities in promoting the
movement. Captain W. H. Marstnn, president of the Board of
Trustees, the highest municipal officer, has this to pay:
BERKELEY, June 27.â T0 the Editor of The Callâ Sir: Per
sonally I approve of the erection of a monument to Dewey most
heartily. It was undoubtedly a wioe move on the part of Mayor
Phelan and the Monument Committee to make this a State
instead of a local affair. It was the appropriate thing to do, and
should meet with a ready response on all sides. I cannot say at
the present moment what stand this city will take. When the
movement for closing saloons was on, a few weeks ago, people
showed an enthusiasm which was quite surprising, and they were
willing and ready to subscribe money even to carry their point.
If the same interest is shown in this, we will be able to do
something substantial. I intend to talk the question over with
several of the leading citizens, and should it seem advisable we
shall call a public meeting in order to bring it before the city.

"FREDERICK,
THE GREAT" AT
THE ALCAZAR
To set a living, breathing Frederick
before a critical public is a task that
might strain the combined ability of half
a dozen good dramatic writers. That vio
lent, egotistical, savage, yet tender and
affectionate old paradox, who galloped
from the field of Mollwitz for very fright
at his first battle and was yet the greatest
commander of his age. owing many a de
feat to his own blunders and many ;i vic
tory to his generals; that military despot,
without confidants, who without scruple
would abandon his allies at the moment
of victory: that lover of poetry, who yet
missed the best literary companionship
because he hated his mother tongue and
knew no other save his idolized French
which he never learned to spell: that
humorist who signed himself "by the
the grace of God, King of Prussia. Elec
tor of Brandenburg and possessor of Vol
taire." whom he "knew to be a scoun
drel." and yet made use of for very need.
By some lie was painted the sensualist
and voluptuary, by others the epitome of
moderation, benevolence, peace; a tena
cious old warhorse who lived beyond his
three score and ten on four hours" sleep
mi t of twenty-four and died possessed of
but one fine dress and so poor in shirts
that his valet de chambre supplied one
for his burial.
George Foster Platt. the author, who
also manages the stage and plays a part
well, has covered with his strong play
three eventful years of Frederick's life.
and he has handled his subject well. He
is such a master at writing good speeches
and inventing clever situations that we
wish he might 'never condescend to a pub
lic taste for broad comedy. 'Tjs the one
false note in a vigorous composition. In
four acts he shows us the King in his
moods of domestic tyranny, his phases of
wit and philosophy, his military greatness
and decision, that counted not the cost;
his tender sympathies for those who
worked and "suffered in the Interests of
his empire. In the play Silesia, for which
he fought so many years, is made the
theme of his life: La Rarbnrina. the Star
of Italy, its variation. The present ver
sion Is not the one featured by Mr. Mor
rison during his coming season, for the
last two acts have been rewritten, greatly
enhancing its value and strength. The
Alcazar stage was found Inadequate to
the scenic needs of the altered work. Mr.
Morrison plays Frederick with unmistak
able pleasure In the part and with the
light and shade that make a most con
vincing picture of the crusty old fire
eater. He "sees" Frederick and trans
lates his vision into his work. In his
generous giving of the best that is in him
he is a quiet sermon to many a slovenly
worker In his chosen field. Would they
might profit by it. In the hands of Miss
Roberts La Barbarina is indeed a Star of
Italy and several other places. Her knack
of appearing In a new gown and fetching
head dress whenever scenes need bright
ening whs appreciated by the audience
and applauded before even a word was
spoken. Her first stormy interview with
Frederick was refreshing as a breeze In
August. T wonder why actors have never
thought of responding to encores and re
peating scenes! If opera singers take that
liberty, why not the mummers? Now.
there's an argument for an enterprising
essayist! The Yon Trenck of Mr. "Whlt
tlppev was excellent â all the more so as
the Amelia of the cast could never inspire
the beautiful, impassioned love speeches
spoken so tenderly and gracefully. Mr.
Scott's Voltaire is yet a little uncertain
as to key. With larger time he will grasp
the character more securely. He cannot
be created in a week. We commend the
handling of the scene where he and Mau
perltus exchange the gentlemanly cour
tesies of pig and fool. Miss Howe's
Countess Swartzfeld w#s somewhat strid
ent and rather fortissimo; Mr. Webster's
General Hulson a very creditable per
formance. Miss Virginia Drew made her
professional debut as the Queen and
seemed fresh from the hands of the elo
cution teacher. She has talent, but must
undo much of her training.
"Frederick the Great" !s educational
and merits the best houses. In these days
of patriotism and firecrackers it is well
to remember that he once sent a sword
of honor to our own Washington with
the generous message. "From the oldest
general In the world to the greatest "

THE CALL CRITIC AGAIN.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: Would
you kindly grant spare for another letter
âthe last on this subjectâ from "Another
Call Critic," fo called. In answer to the
undersigned, in your issue of the 13th
inst., you Pay in regard to Iloilo, "the
Spanish surrender to the natives made
them by the laws of war the sovereigns
of Panay; thc-y made the conquest, forced
the surrender and ended Spanish jurisdic
tion themselves without help from us."
I claim that Dewey gave great assist
ance in the taking of Iloilo by the na
tives, and he never left Manila Bay,
either. He sank the ships that could
have relieved the town and penned up the
Spanish soldiers in Manila that could
have reinforced the garrison had t h < \
been able to get there. In other words,
he made it possible for the natives tj
take the place, just as much as he pre
vented the American merchant vessels "f
the Pacific Coast from being captured
or destroyed, and he was not here, either.
His guns reached farâ good for some, bad
for others.
It pains me to think that Spain sold
something to the United States for $2 >.
-0 that she did not own. Uncle Sam,
thought to be so sharp in business (evon
if he could not fight), failed to find the
cloud on the title. Not even friendly Eng
land or any great power warned poor
uncle, and only one flying diplomat
named Agoncillo noticed the flaw and
protested Poor title and all, I would likv?
to see some foreign power try to buy
Panay from the natives on the strength
of uncle's bogus title! But in all serious
ness, Mr. Editor, what do you think ought
to be done with those islands? You havÂ°
changed your ideas so much in a year
about those people. In an editorial of
May 12. ISOS. is tht- following: "But when
we did it we destroyed Spain's power to
protect the civilized people of the Philip
pines frnm massacre by the insurgent de
scendants of the Malay headhunter*.
Talk about a republic in those islands
is like talk about a Sioux or an Apache
republic in Dakota or Arizona. Not only
are those Â£.000.000 mongrels ignorant of
self-government." etc. etc.
Hops an Apache change In a year?
Thanking you in advance. I remain, yours
respectfully. WILLIAM STILL.

THE HANDSOME TEACHER OF
ALAMEDA.
To the Editor nf The Callâ Sir: In jus
tice to others, permit me pome of your
space. I rrfer to "Handsome Teacher
Wanted" in your Alameda columns of the
24th inst.. and to squibs in other papers
not Po reputable.
I am at the service of reporters at all
times, but it is in writing over my signa
ture; all other statements I disown.
About five months a*o, as Clerk, I re
ceived an application for our school "on
the occurrence of a vacancy." I filed it.
Recently two Trustees were elected. The
new board is organized for business tha
first Saturday in July. Not until then
can a teacher be elected. I, a hold-over,
called the new board together to discuss'
informally, school matters. As I under
stand it. we thought the sentiment of the
district preferred a teacher of experience
up to date in methods; if a lady, unmar
ried, and a stranger to the district; and
I learned our school was promised to rio
one. also that about twenty applications
were looked over.
The writer of this five-months-old ap
plicationâwas she alive, in reach, did s!ie
still wish the school, who was she, mar
rtea or single? We did not know
After we parted, it occurred to me it :
would be a kind act to let the lady know
there was a vacancy and the testimon
ials needed.
The other Trustees were as ignorant of !
my writing, and what I wrote, as the
good President of the T'nited States. ,
And any statement purporting to rumt
from me that I looked upon anything I [
wrote as a joke, or that the other Irus
tecs did. cr knew of it. or approved of it, I
is as false as false can be. no matter
"here it appears or who may say it.
Did the lady remember having sent this I
old application? To fully refresh her '
memory in the premises ' and save my j
time. I noted on her application and
mailed it in the envelope she had ad
dressed.
"There is a vacancy: will be filled early
in July. Wa wish a teacher of experi
ence, up to date, and unmarried." The I
application and address were silent on
thesethree needs. I did not write "Misa
â " or "Madame." for I did not know
which she was; or age, or looks. "If
good looking that is no objection and
one Trustee is single. I write you be
cause this application is old."
i A teacher of experience would have
said: "Ah. good! I will have the chil
dren of but two Trustees in school."
"Good looking!" Emphasize these two
words. I did not say "handsome." I cio
not wish children for ten months in Ihj
year to face an 111-looking teacher. Of
course, I never saw one. Now, if yaiL
say she is both good looking and h.Vij^P
some or beautiful, that Is an added m--r V
I will ever think so. T
To my dull head, all I wrote is purs
business. I never thought it a joke, or
ever said so or Intimated so. And n;>
one knew a word I had written prior to
the receiver opening it.
I am thus explicit to clear the nth^r
Trustees of my crime. They did not
elect me Clerk; they cannot depose na
and are wholly innocent. They are good
men. and the attempt to drag them into
this is not the act of good men.
Who dragged the applicant before thÂ»
public is not for me to say. \estenlay t
lady purporting to be her married c
with her husband called on me. Sh
stated that her father and sister were | n
Amador County all this time and had
been, and knew nothing of it.
She appeared greatly distressed, "and
my sister Is so modest and retirine
suffering will be awful!"
If the applicant has friends who. i
absence, receive, open and make pi
hT letters and act the fool genera
is a misfortune I trust your paper
make all the amends it can.
We will npfii school with two of t u ,<Â»
best Trustees (I am so black all that has
been satd touches me noti and the t
snitiost schoolhouse in Alameda Coi
and we want the best equipped tea
in the county.
Said applicant may he that teacher.
and I tried to give her such notice thai
she could make that fact known to -
Trustees. But her friends, ah! hÂ«r
friends! Honl soft gui ma! y pense.

should be Instrumental in returning the
Clark baby t" tts mother. When the bahv
was found the Journal announced tha*
$1000 should be given to the woman who

lice on the track of the kidnapers, and
$1000 should be deposited with the Jour
nal's pet trust company, to be paid to th"
baby herself when she reached the age of
twenty-one or should get married. Why
the baby should receive any part of the
money promised to its discoverers is not
apparent. Perhaps it never will. The life
expectation of a twenty-months' baby
gives the Journal a good strong string on
that $1000. And yet it asks the public to
help it make capital out of Admiral

money to buy him a loving cup which he

TO "READJUST" OPPOSED
English Stockholders of the Central
Pacific Appeal to the United
States Court.
Bill to Restrain the Manipulators From Merging the
Stock Into the Capacious Maw of the
Southern Pacific Company.
English stockholders of the Central Pacific Railroad Company have ap
pealed to the United States Circuit Court to restrain C. P. Huntington and
Ais associates from absorbing the Central Pacific into the Southern Pacific
Company and to stop the payment of interest on new bonds or mortgages if
jssued or made.
The bill occupies nearly 100 pages of typewritten matter. Like Victor â¢
Hugo's "History of a Crime," it is "fresh, bleeding with facts." It recites
the history of manipulations by Huntington and his associates by which
manipulations, it is alleged, they have enriched themselves and defrauded'
the stockholder*. The bill traverses the allegation that more than 90 per
cent of the shareholders of the road were committed to the readjustment
schemes of Mr. Huntington.
The bill is a blow at the vitals of the Huntington ring, and it promises
to inaugurate one of the mGst desperate legal battles of a decade.
AT the last annual election by the
stockholders <>f the Central Pacific
Railroad Company it was stated that
ore thai 90 per cent of the share
. holders of the road were committed to
the readjustment scheme conceived by
Mr. Huntingdon, the purpose of which i-s
the absorption of the Central Pacific by
â¢ the Southern Pacific Company. In the
carrying forward of this scheme .Mr.
Huntington's co-workers are the Spcyers,
B stock and bond dealing firm of London
end New York.
The basis of the readjustment pian Is
to increase the bonded debt of the Cen

Then come the allegations In the bill In :
relation to the conspiracy and thÂ» doings
of It to accomplish the results, stating thai j
r the Identity of said combination
i -piracy originally formed has been
changed, nor has its continuity been in
terrupted. They extend the conspiracy
originally formed to defraud the Central
Pacific Railroad and its stockholders Lo
ther corporations and to the C( ti
â¢ c Railroad, and have continuously
defrauded all the corporations and their
stockholders up to the present time. They j
controlled and elected all the directors of
corporations and co-operated with
them in defrauding the stockholders. 'i ..e
' bill alleges that Huntington has been a! all
times the a. -ting and leading member
thereof directing and personally conduct-
Ing its most important business transac
tions .md as his associates were suc
vely removed by death, his superior
;â¢ tai cc with its past transactions
and the railroads built or dealt with by
it, his great talents, enlarged experience
and his seniority In years and his control
majority of the stock of the Southern
Pacific Company gained for him a more
commanding position and greater author- I
Itj in said company, so that since thn
death of Mark Hopkins he lihs practically
ruled it ami dire. 'ted its operations.
That Huntington and his associates ex
tended their conspiracy to pian and build
B rival competing railroad to reach from
â¢ San Francisco to New < (rleans, which
they did. and so Boon as that railroad
was completed set on foot a scheme to j
sell out all their stock in the Central
Pacific Railroad, while they retained the
control and management in their own
hands. To that end. it is alleged, they
1 got up a form of certificate ot ownership
j of shares of stock in the Central Pacific
Railroad Company of coupons attached
for dividends, describing the dividends by
; numbers, and caused it to be print',! and
used, and the certificates, instead of being
I made out in their own names, were made ;
out in the names of dummies, divided up
into parcels. Then they took buck prox
ies from the holders to vote on the shares
I and put these st"ck certificates on the
! market, and. still holding the proxies from
their dummies, the original holders were
able for years to vote on this stock. That
the English stockholders, being afraid of
assignment, neglected to register their
I stock; that Huntington and his associates
1 formed a pool, sent stock over to England, I
where it was sold out. with the exception
of Stanford, who retained 33,000 of his
! bonds to his death.
While they were selling out the stock.
. and from that time on. they were building i
\ the Southern Pacific Railroad out of the
; income and assets of the Central Pacific. I
bo that in fact the Central Pacific built:
the Southern Pacific line, which was to
I compete with the Central Pacific They
! then procured a charter from the State of
i Kentucky for the Southern Pacific Com
pany, which has a nominal capital of !
! $150,000,000, but the liability of all the ;
stockholders jointly is $1,000,000. The cap
, ital stock 'if that corporation was paid
i up by the capital stock of other railroad â 
J companies at valuations they had 'ix.-d
among themselves. These other corpora
j tions whose stock constituted the property
j ami capital of the Southern Pacific are
those railroads reaching from Goshen to
New Orleans, which have never paid any
dividends, never can pay any dividends
and are now bonded fur very much more
| than their value, so that they are prac
i tlcally insolvent. These are the assets of!
: the Southern Pacific (.'ompany.
Complaint then alleges the formation of
the Ranbury committee in London, repre
senting the F.nglish stockholders who
united to Investigate the affairs of the |
Central Pacific and ascertain why it was
that from the time the Southern Pacific
I Railroad was finished for about ten years
I they received only 1 per cent dividends on
their stock. That the business of the
Banbury committee was to investigate the :
i fraudulent and dishonest conduct of
Huntington and his associates, but that
they were bribed in various ways to keep
quiet In regard to what they had learned
That over $1')0.0<)0 has been pnld out of
the treasury "f the Central Pacific to this
Banbury committee under various pre- ''
tenses. The complaint speaks of the visit
of Sir Charles Rivers Wilson to this coun
try states what he ascertained in regard
' to these frauds and bo reported to the Han
bury committee; that his feo was $50,000
and the Banbury committee allowed Mr.
Huntington to pay It.
The bill says that the corrupt and cor

the Banbury committee have been contin
ued to the prÂ» cent time: they are now and.
have been corresponding with him and
all his dealings with the corporation".
That the directors elected in April, >..â¢

ton; that they voted over SIOO.QQQ to bo

He is but 27 years of age, and among his clerical brethren is rated as one of
the brightest wearers of the cloth in this country. For several years he
has been identified with American Zionism, holding the highest positions in
conventions, domestic and foreign, for. the furtherance of Zionist principles.
Rabbi Wise traces his lineage through generations of rabbis. As spirit

incorporated and advised with Huntlng
ton In regard to the present scheme to
refund the securities of the Central ia
cific Railroad. It shows that on the â'l
of April. 1899, Speyer ft Co.. through one
of their members, attended the meeting
and cast a vote for 6i>x,Wo shares of stock,
â  ."I shares were voted by Bretnerton,
32000 shares of which, within sixty days,
had been purchased from Jane LtUhrop
Stanford to obviate her opposition to the
i. funding plan and other plans ot said
Huntington and hid associates, were lrv
cluded in the stock voted by Speyer Â«k
<-Â a i S o 380,000 shares represented by tne
Banbury committee. And Huntington
voted the 1000 shares on his old prox.es.
That by these votes were elected Isaac
L. Requa, J. C. Kirkpatrick. Charles F.
Hunt. George R. Burdick. George t .
Schwartz. Eugene C. McShane and ,
Charles H. Trolliet. That all these direc
tors were clerks, employes and apents of
Spever & Co. and th.'ir associates in tha
banking business, employed by their
correspondent, the London, Purls and
American Bank, in which they are all
bookkeepers, messengers, etc. That they
: were put in there for the purpose of car
rying- through this Huntlngton-Speyer re
adjustment plan, and they will do so un
less restrained by court.
The bill alleges further that the Cen
i tral Pacific Railroad Company owed in
bonds, giving a list of the mortgages by
which they are secured, $."5,5i2.71."> 4K. due
! the United" States, and $39,485,000 to be re
; funded or paid out. It sets out the. author
ity given to the commissioners appointed
1 by the Government to settle the claim
of the United States and that they Bet
tied the claim by accepting twenty notes
of th.> Central Pacific Railroad Company,
â¢ which is payable every six months,
for $2,940.835 78 each, and that Speyer &
Co advanced the money for the first
four notes. It charges that the whol*
scheme was gotten up prior to the. Ist !
, of February, 1-:^. which was the day the ,
! Government made the settlement, al- i
gh the papers were all dated after-
I wardâ one on the Sth day of February :
and the other of February 2S. 1899. Thc*e
papers state the agreement between the :
readjustment managers, as they are i
called, viz.: the foreign bankers, the Cen- j
tral Pacific Railroad Company and the |
I tanl >iry committee.
This plan sets out numerous bonuses
and premiums to be paid on refunding the :
onds" for iÂ«ew ones to l>e issued un
i der a new mortgage to be oxeeu t Â«'Â«l for
' $100,000,000 and a second mortgage for
$25,000,000. A great portion of the B*Â»cond \
mortgage bonds is used up ir. premiums
I for the surrender of the old bonds, s 'in â¢
1 twenty million dollars of which do not
\ mature and arc not payable for eighteen
j ears to come.
The Central Pacific Railroad Company
â¢ Is t" issue, according to this plan, ac
cumulative preferred stock to the amount
of $20,000,000, to have a 4 per cent dividend
- before any dividend can be declared on
> the common stock, but in the case of
foreclosure and sale the holders of the
accumulative preferred su>'-k, which
would be the Southern Pacific Company,
as they propose to buy it. to se
cure the sum equal to the aggregate
par value of the accumulative pre
i ferred stock, and the Southern Pacific
;to bus 'l |is accumulative preferred
I stock of the Central Pacific Railroad by
paying them In Southern Pacific Company
: bonds t i an equal amount; that all the
shares of the Central Pacirlc Railroad
Company represented by the certificates
of the Banbury committee, amounting to
377,000 shares, are to be paid for in stock
of the Southern Pacific Company share
for share.
The bill claims that this contract is il
legal; that there is no law in California
for the issuance of preferred stock, and
' there is ii" provision in the articles of
: Incorporation of the Central Pacific Rail-
I road Company allowing it, and that such
preferred stock would be Illegal if issued
without the consent of the complainant,
as it would violate the contract between
him and the Central Pacific Railroad
Company when he became a stockholder.
Alleges that the stock of the Southern
Pacific Company is worthless if the com
pany possesses no money, has no prop
erty except stock of the Southern Pacific
of California, of Arizona and New Mex
ico, on none of which have any of these
companies been able to pay any divi
dends and cannot now pay any. The
bonded Indebtedness of the Southern Pa-
I cific Company and of these corporations
,x, as the value of all the property of
the Southern Pacific Company. That the
only security for the payment of Its bonds,
aggregating $20,000,000, is only a collateral
mortgage on the shares of accumulative
preferred stock and on the common stock.
which, may be transferred to the Southern
Pacific Company by the Banbury com
mittee or the holders of Banbury certifi
cates. That this device of exchanging
shares of Southern Pacirlc Company's
Stock for Central Pacific Railroad Com
'â  pany'a stock is to enable the Southern Pa
cific Company to again get control of the
Central Pacific and stop all competition.
Sets out the premium to be given for
I the different classes of bonds ranging
from $29 in cash and $30 in new mortgage
bonds on every $100 of the older securities
to $â¢"" In cash and $75 in mortgage, bonds,
and in ore case $41 In cash and $W(i in new
| mortgage bonds were to be paid on every
$1000 of bonds of that particular class.
That the value of the amount of bonuses
and premiums paid according to this plan
oul of the second mortgage of $25,000,000
will be $23,486,200 In bonds and $2,500,506 36
in cash, out of the $20,000,000 to be paid to
the Central Pacirlc Railroad Company for
: Its preferred stock $12,000,000 shall be used
to pay the expenses of the readjustment,
and ; >'it of the second mortgage bonds
i $11,305,000 shall be used to provide cash
and money to execute the readjustment
The bill claims that this new indebted
ness of $125,000,000 is illegal and fraudu
lently made up to take up bonds issued in
fraud of the Central Pacific Railroad
Company. That the bonds on which the
bonuses and premiums are to be paid are
jointly held by Huntington and his asso
ciates and the Pacific Improvement Com
pany; that besides the JT25.000.000 of any
Indebtedness under this plan there is $17.
--'.>.> i 000 of bonds now secured on the prop
erty Of the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany not provided to lx> paid, so that un
der the plan the debt will soon amount to
i $14? 0M 000 while the present debt before
the 'refunding is only $11Â»;.253.71=. 4S. After
applying the sinking funfis now in hand
to the debt which is now due the real
debt is only about $108,53>.763 13. The com
plainant objects to taking the sinking
fund now pledged to pay the present debt
and turning it over to the trustees of the
new second mortgage.
Alleges the scheme of increasing the
debt pimply provides a corruption funu
i which may be used to persuade the hold
ers of the' Banbury certificates (amount
ing to 377. 'X>0 shares) to transfer them to
' the Southern Pacific Company, to tne
! control of said Huntington and his asso
' dates, that is. to the Southern Pacific
Company, which thus becomes the suc
cessor oj the Central Pacific Railroad and
i destroys the value of that railroad to the
i public as a competing line.
Th 2 prayer of the complaint Is for an^
Injunction to restrain the exchange of
these <-ertincates for preferred stock and
to restrain the increase of the debt of the
Central J'uolnc, the newly planned $100.
--fn 10,000 first refunding mortgage and %**>,
--000,000 second refunding mortgage.

but. like most big men, he had a few pet
hobbies of his own, one of which was a
greal aversion to being disturbed or in
terrupted when he wns writing. One
afternoon, as he was sitting at his desk
engaged In the construction of a more
than ordinarily important missive, the
door of his office opened and a young gen
tleman, wearing one of the latest and
most expensive stilts and an air of great
consequence, floated In and introduced
himself ns Mr. Eels, the sou of Dan P.
Eels, one of Milwaukee's most important
business men.
"(Had to see you." said Caldwell.
"Kindly take a chair for a moment; I am
very busy with this letter of mine."
Young Eela took a chair, which was of
the hard scat variety, for which, by the
way. Caldwell'e office was noted.
Caldwell regutned his writing and 7-">ls
pal and gazed into space while the pemnds
merged themselves into minutes that, in
turn, lengthened out into quarter and
half hours. Finally Kcls could stund it
no longer and, taking out his watch, he
glanced at the time. Then, rising, he
stood in front of CaJdwell'a desk and said:
"Sir, I have but little time to spare, and
T wish to bo attended to. I am the son of
Dan P. Eels."
"You are who?" inquired Caldwell with
out raising his eyes from the paper.
"I am the son of Dan P. Eels," repeated
the young man.
"Oh," said Caldwell. "that makes a dif
ference. I did not understand you when
you first came in. Be seated again, 1 beg
of you. Put take two chairs this time."
When Julius Caesar reached the hanks
of the Ruhicon he paused. Even his
mighty soul hesitated at the contempla
tion of that which was before him.
Among his officers was a tribune by the
name of Patriclus Hnsea Farrellus, who,
witnessing the despondency Into which
his chief was thrown, sought to cheer him
up a bit by telling him the above story.
Caesar heard him to the end, and then,
with an awful expression of pain and ap
prehension upon his usually stern and
martial countenance, he cast one look
upon the Jester and with all his harness
on his back plunged headlong into the
tide, never stopping until he stood upon
the further shore. Those of his soldiers
who were near enough to hear the tale
with one aerord followed him. History
has already chronicled the result.

tirely unexpected, as the two troops were
not slated to sail before July 12. It was
thought that they were to await the ar
rival of Troops D and II from the Yellow
stone Park, and the four troops were to
go on the City of Para. According to the
change of programme, Troops B and M,
with the two companies of the Twenty
fifth, will go aboard the McDowell at the
Presidio wharf at an early hour this
morning and will be taken to the Valen
cia, which is to sail this afternoon. The
BUdden change in the orders as heretofore
issued was the result of orders received
at department headquarters for the im
mediate dispatching of the transports
Valencia and Pennsylvania. This means
that the transports are needed at Manila
for the purpose of bringing back the vol
unteers. The headquarters and one com
pany of the Twenty-fourth Infantry with
two companies of "the Twenty-nftn In
fantry and GOO recruits are to go aboard
the Pennsylvania on Friday. Major
Morton, Fourth Cavalry, will be in com
mand of the troops on the Valencia, and
Colonel Freeman of those sailing on the
Pennsylvania.
Colonel Greenleaf, surgeon in charge of
the erection of the camps which are being
built at the Presidio for the returning
volunteers, will leave in a few days for
Portland, Or., where he goes to super
intend the erection of a camp which will
be used by the Second Oregon Regiment
pending Its being mustered out.
Colonel Greenleaf stated yesterday,
however, that the Oregon regiment would
first come to San Francisco and would
go Into camp here for a short while
before going to Portland. The present
muster out camps that are being built at
the Presidio are the largest that have
ever been erected by the Government.
Those on th<- old cavalry parade rover tho
area between the Lombard-street en
trance and the new general hospital and
will accommodate several thousand men.
All of the teats will be provided with
plank floors and stoves and the men will
have houses in which to cook and eat.
Two camps of a similar nature will be
immediately created upon the slope to tho
left of the Union-street car line where it
enters the Presidio.
The orders of Captain Stephen M.
Foote, Sixth Artillery, have been changed.
He has been ordered to report to the com
manding officer at the Presidio for duty
with the recruits pending transportation
to the Philippines. On Monday he was
under orders to join his battery at Hono
lulu.
Cpfin the recommedation of the, chief
surgeon of the department acting Assist
ant Burgeon James B. Cutter has been re
lieved from duty with the recruits at the
Presidio and ordered to report to the
commanding officer at Alcatraz Island for
duty at that post, relieving Assistant Bur
geon W. F. Dudley. Acting Assistant
Burgeon William Grey Miller has been or
dered to report for duty at the gener-il
hospital at the Presidio. Acting Assist
ant Surgeon James E. Shellenbergor has
also been ordered to r^p^t to the same
place for duty. Acting Assistant Surgeon
John H. Hereford has been similarly as
signed. __

JONES COMPROMISED.
Paid Two Thousand Dollars Into
Court to Settle With the Gov
ernment.
David W. Jones, a wealthy lumberman
of Siskiyou County, paid into the United
States TMstriet Court yesterday $2000 as
a compromise in the cases pending against
him in that court, the authorities at
Washington having consented to accept
that sum.
Jones was tried before a jury in the
District Court several weeks ago in a suit
brought by the Government to recover
$21 OfK) the alleged value of timber cut by
him on (government land. A verdict was
returned in his favor, but the I'nited
States Attorney gave notice that he would
take an appeal.
A criminal charge against Jones for cut
ting timber on Government land is pend
ing, but thi.s will be dismissed under the
terms of the compromise.

â¢ SAVED BY MRS. PINKHAM. '
[LETTES TO MRS. FINEHAM NO. 72,806]
"You have saved my life, snatched
me from the brink of the grave almost,
and I wish to thank you. About eigh-
teen 1 months ago I was a total wreck,
physically. I had been troubled with
leucorrhoea for some time, but had given
hardly any attention to the trouble.
"At last inflammation of the womb
and ovaries resulted and then I suf-
fered agonies, had to give up my pro-
fession (musician and piano player),
was confined to my bed and life became
a terrible cross. My husband sum-
moned the best physicians, but their
benefit was but temporary at best. I
believe I should have contracted the
morphine habit under their care, if my
common sense had not intervened.
"One day my husband noticed the ad-
vertisement of your remedies and im-
mediately bought me a full trial. Soon
the pain in my ovaries was gone. lam
now well, strong and robust, walk,
ride a wheel, and feel like a girl in her
teens. I would not be without Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound; it
is like water of life to me. I am very
gratefully and sincerely your well-
wisher, and I heartily recommend your
remedies. I hope some poor creature
may be helped to health by reading my
story." â Mrs. Col. E. P. Richabdson,

BIG SCANDAL IN
THE FOURTH OF
JULY COMMITTEE
Alleged Attempt to
Extort Money.
J. M. CHRETIEN'S BAD BREAK
PUTS T. P. ROBINSON IN A PECU-
LIAR POSITION.
A. S. Baldwin Says Chretien Asked
Him for Fifty Dollars, on Be
haJf of the Colonel, for
Services Rendered.
Ugly rumors are being circulated con
cerning alleged attempts on the part of
certain members of the Fourth of July
committee to extort money In connection
with the big celebration, and a letter
written by A. B. Baldwin of the Glen.
Pa fie Company to Colonel T. P. Robin
son,' chairman of the fireworks commit
tee,-, yesterday afternoon. In which he di
rectly, accuses that gentle-man of solicit- j
mx : a bribe through the agency of John |
M. Chretien, has created a sensation and
. the matter will be thoroughly invtsli
gated at a. meeting of the executive com
mittee to-nlcht.
|: Mr.. Baldwin was "approached" by Mr.
â  Chretien yesterday with a request that
â¢'.ihcbJÃend' Mr. Robinson his check for *. r . I.
Baldwin refused point blank to do as re
quested and started out with Mr. Chre
:. tien' to .'. find Robinson, Intending to de
man&.-an explanation. They visited the
.: hta.l^raners of the Fourth of Jury com- i
;. mlttee-.-in the Grand Hotel and several
.other, places, but the Colonel could not
â  bje foil rid. Mr. Baldwin then returned to
...his office and indited the letter which has
create.} consternation in the headquar
ters The letter Is as follows: ;
; :. : BAN FRANCISCO, June ".'. 1599.
.'.:; >!r T. P. Robinson, Chairman Commit- I
vt efi ".tin Fireworks, Fourth of July Celebra
tion, Grand Hotel, Cityâ Denr Sir: This
â  afternoon I was called upon by Mr John M
.'â  Chretien and was told In- him that >..u re
â ' ijujred anJ demanded of the Glen Park
Company the sum of $50 personally. In con
sideration of the services rendered by you
In urinK a dfsnlay of fireworks ori the
night, of the Fourth of July at Glen Park.
I confess that 1 was somewhat surprised
at this ai â ; arently unwarranted and un- j
usual demand, but Mr. Chretien assured
. me that he was fully authorized by you to
request it of me. I called with Mr Chre
tien at the headquarters of the committee,
In. the Grand Hotel, and also made other
efforts to find you.
My object In writing you is to ii.form
you that I do not Intend to comply with
. this request, and after considering the mat
' ter,' I have concluded to withdraw the per
}. 'â¢â¢ mlision which was Kranted to have any dis
â¢. â¢â ":â¢ .play of lircworks at Glen Park. My reason
' â¢; ' for dolner this Is that it seems apparent
â¢ from Mr. Chretien's statement that you and
. other members of the Fourth of July Com
. â  Mit: will have to be properly compensated
. foe â .services which I have heretofore consid
ered we're for the benefit of the public arid
. not* for personal profit. Yours truly,
â '.'.â¢â  . A. S. BALDWIN".
Th' letter was delivered to Colonel
Robinson about >> o'clock last evening, and
he immediately started out to find Mr.
Chretien. He located the latter at his i
house and they then proceeded to Mr.
Bald â â â¢â  residence, accompanied by G. i
R Fletcher, chairman of the executive
committee. Colonel Robinson declined to
discuss the affair until he had talked with i
Mr, Baldwin, but Mr. Chretien was less
cautious. He was seen at his residence
before he had been informed of Mr. Bald- ;
win's action in sending the letter and ad
mitted that he had talked with the latter
concerning compensation for Robinson,
although he was careful to deny that any
thing wrong had been Intended.
;;'Thls matter is a great surprise to me," !
he.sdld.- "I hardly know what to make of â 
It, but I certainly do not know anything
.about .any attempt to extort money. I '
saw Mr. Baldwin to-day and we got to
talking about fireworks and the prepara
tions that were being made to celebrate :
the Fourth. I remarked that Robinson
. as chairman of the fireworks committee
.-.had .worked hard to have a display of 'â¢
: . !".)â â¢ work at Glen Park, and he expected
something for his trouble. I did not ask
.'â¢.for $00 or any other sum. It seems
strange, that Baldwin should write such a
letter when, before the committee decided
that Glen Park should be given a part of
the appropriation, he was ready to do
anything and everything to get the fire
works there. I believe he would have ;
been .glad to have given Mr. Robinson $10)
for his' influence before the distribution!
was made, but now that he has obtained
what he was after I suppose he feels in- '
dependent." â 
Colonel Robinson gave out a statement
after, an Interview with Mr. Baldwin, in
which he branded Chretien as a meddler
and declared he had given the latter no
authority to solicit money on his account
or even to collect subscriptions for the
Fourth, of July fund.
'. : 'I took Chretien with m. to Bee Mr
.Baldwin;" said Robinson, "as I was de
â¢>jrbU.s of getting at the bottom of the
' matter as quickly as possible He ad
; mitted that he had asked Mr. Baldwin
â  for -.money., but denied that he had acted
..{is? my.-, representative in doing so. He
>?1d : had asked Baldwin to subscribe
. $;.'! ami requested him to Bend a check for
' that .amount to me, 'personally.' He ad- i
. knitted that he bad used the word 'per
sonally,' but could not explain why he
had done so.
â¢ "As a. matter of fact I have had noth
ing to do with the collection of subscrip
tions: and have told everybody from whom
we expected to receive help." Mr. Baldwin
included, not to pay any money to any
body but a member of the finance com
mittee. When the question of selecting !
locations for the fireworks displays came
up it. was proposed that the lot opposite
the Chutes, North Beach and the lot at
the corner of Sixteenth and Folsom be
selected.
"The Mission Improvement clubs refused
to subscribe (or the fund if too Folsrm
street site was selected, as they w.-rf all
In favor of having the display at Â«jlen
Park. They promised to raise about ?400
and half Of that amount has been sub
scribed. Mr. Baldwin giving $25. Glen Park
was finally selected and we understood
on the authority of Mr. Chretien, who Is
a member of the fireworks committee and
vice president of the executive committee
that Mr. Baldwin would give $50 After
the meeting last Thursday Chretien said
"When shall I go to Baldwin for tha
s3o?" I have no recollection that he was
told to go at any time, and If he did I
â¢ so he went on his own authority.
"I told Mr. Baldwin that I should bring
this matter up at the meeting of the ex
â¢ ecutive committee to-morrow night and
asked him to be present, to which he
agreed. 1 intend to demand a thorough
. investigation of the whole affair."
Colonel Robinson's account of what
transpired at Mr. Baldwin's house puts
Mr. Chretien in a peculiar position. He
made a different statement, according to
the. colonel, at that conference from that
given out by himself earlier in the even
ing. He certainly visited Mr. Baldwin
with a request for money, or at le-ast with
an intimation that Robinson expected
"something," and he Is likely to .have
: some difficulty In explaining what he
meant and who authorized him to act.
The meeting of the executive committee
to-night promises to be Interesting.

QTJARBZL STARTED THROUGH
A DISCOURTESY.
A Priest Who Visited the Jail Was
Insulted by the Guardâ The
Victim Somewhat Improved.
Frank McFarland. the Assistant Super
intendent of Branch County Jail No. 3,
who beat Guard Louis Kirschbaum Into
Insensibility on Sunday night, is now
. lin the City Prison, where he broods
continuously over his act. He will give
no explanation of the assault, neither by
way of extenuation nor excuse. All ques
tions that are asked him receive but the
one reply that his attorney, A. Ruef, has
advised him not to discuss the matter and
he will follow the injunction placed upon
his speech.
At midnight Louis Kirschbaum. still
unconscious on his pallet at the German
Hospital, was resting easily. The physi
cians in attendance said that he was
somewhat Improved, and there was some
ince for his recovery. Kirschbaum has
i â¢ yet been charged on the books, as
the crime will be determined by th" re-
B of the beating which he was sub
]( 'ted to.
Many reports have been circulated as to
the motive of McFarland in his attack
upon the guard. It is rumor' d thai the
111 feeling which existed between the two
had been fanned by an incident which
happened on Sunday.
A priest. Rev. Father Cardelll. con
nected with St. Ignatius Church, called at
the Jail to tender his services to any who
desired them and according to the custom
of the institution was invited to break
fast with the officials. Kirschbaum. on
seeing the reverend gentleman seato.i at
the table, is reported to have immediately
withdrawn, protesting in strong terms
that he would not sit down with any one
of the clergyman's profession.
Capta n Otto L'-mcke on hearing of the
gross discourtesy rebuked Kirschbaum
Beverely, recalling that he had given or
ders that all visitors admitted to th>- jail.
no matter what their profession or de
nomination, should be treated with un
varying :-. .- pect.
The incident excited the keenest sensa
tion and though McFarland is not ac
counted a deeply religious man, it is said
that the gratuitous Insult to a worthy
man deepened his contempt for Kirsch
baum and Indirectly accelerated the
fracas whir-h may result so fatally.
captain I^emcke confirmed this account
of the incident last night and said he had
no doubt but what the facts would be
used to mitigate and explain the action
of McFarland. H<' deeply regretted the
affair which, he repeated, was in direct
contravention of his orders in regard to
courtesy to all visitors to the jail.
In Aid of the Fancy Fair.
The ladies of St. Anthony Booth will
give an entertainment and social in St.
Brendan's Hall this evening, the affair
being for the coming fancy fair. The
preparations for the entertainment are
being supervised by Luke O'Brien, Mrs.

WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH MOROSCO'S ?
AsktM Steven > Asks Some Pertinent
Questions as to the Absence
of the Crowd.
NOW that Southwell has gone
and Morosco once again
reigns supreme in Mission
street, it is no more than fit
that tht- bill should be "The
Lily of Killarney," the good old Irish
melodrama that without the music is
known as "The Colleen Bawn." In
three acts only it is, to be sure, but
the scenes are manyâ eight, in factâ
and the rich essence of southside melo
drama drops from every line. It took
me back to the old days to see this old
piece last night, to the days when Mo
rosco lorded it over everything on the
tropical side of Market street and
boasted the only week-in-and-week-out
clientele in the town. But one ingre
dient of the illusion was missingâ the
audience. Acres, it seemed, of empty
red plush burned against the lights.
Row after row of rich upholstery
yawned from the main floor, the gal
leries were dotted by diminutive
groups, and the boxes, all save one,
were spectacularly vacant. The sight
saddened me. Here was the most com
fortable, commodious theater in San
Francisco, an excellent all-round com
pany of comic opera singers, a suffi
cient orchestra, a fair production of a
charming opera, a good seat down
stairs for the ridiculous price of 35
centsâ and not enough people in the
house to stuff a pie with. And
the ex-Southwell company just
engaged by Mr. Morosco fur a
season of forty weeks! Well, the
dear music-loving public would better
sit up and take notice of a good
thing before some one else is wearing
the Morosco diamonds and driving the
Morosco poniesâ for comic opera com
panies are expensive. The show is
there, the theater is there with an en
vironment clean and comfortable, but
the audience is missing and has been
missing for some time, in spite of sev
eral sumptuous productions. Every
thing that could be done has been done
by the management, which so far has
studied its patrons' economy rather
than its own in every detail, and it will
be long lasting discredit to the town
if an enterprise like this meets with
no better reward than failure.
I do not desire, especially at this
time, to take back any of the many
lin>-s that I have penciled in praise of
this company, but still in truth I can
not say that this performance of "The
Lily of Killarney" is representative of
the organization. Apart from the fact
that the chorusâ which is the real star
of the Southwells â has only limited op
portunities; there is a characteristic
something that is lacking, a certain
energy and a picturesnueness that
j have been signal in the earlier suc
cesses. The Irishness of the piece
seems to find but faint appreciation in
the players. Mr. Persse sings excep
tionally well in Myles, and his brogue
is in honest token of his nationality,
but the real Irish spell is not there;
no more than it is in Mr. Wolff's Danny
Mann, which, too, is abundantly sung
and industriously acted, but more sug
gestive of Shylock than the Irish j
Danny. In fact the whole performance
is unlrish and admirable only so far
as the singing is concerned.
The Neanderthal Skeleton.
The famous Neanderthal skeleton was
discovered in 1^57 in a cave in the valley
of a small stream near Dusseldorf on the
same level with bones of the extinct cave
bear. The workmen who cxi avated ft
not knowing its value, only saved the
larger bones and the cap of the skull. The
frontal prominences are enormous, pro
ducing a great overhanging supraorbital
ridge, entirely unlike anything ordinarily
Been in the skulls of to-day, and remind
ing one strikingly of the skulls of the
highi-r apes. It was declared by Huxley
to be by far the most ape-like skull that
had hitherto been discovered. The re
maining bones of the skeleton indicated a
man of unusually powerful frame.
A very forcible attack was made upon
the normal character of this skeleton by
Virchow, who pointed out that there are
in it unmistakable signs of the rheumatic
affection known as thritis deformans, and
that this not infrequently led. when of a
very marked type, to a deformity of the
skull similar to that shown in these re
mains. This statement, made by the great
authority of one of the foremost patho
logical anatomists of the time, has been
sufficient to discredit the skull in the eyes
of many anthropologists.â Frank Baker in
the American Anthropologist.

MYSTERY YET
SHROUDS HIS
UNTIMELY END
Was John Kehlenbeck
Chloroformed ?
WACHENDORF WILL NOT TALK
DEAD MAN'S ARM SHOWS MARKS
OF HYPODERMIC SYRINGE.
Police Believe Money May Have Been
an Incentive for Foul Play.
Wachendorf Once Arrested
for Begging.
i The latest developments in the case of
the death of John Kehlenbeck, who died
at 315' i: Jessie- street on Monday morning
tinder mysterious circumstances, tend to I
still further envelop the case in mystery, j
, Dr. C. C. J. Wachendorf, who roomed with j
the dead man and who had him under !
medical treatment, is held by the police
1 pending the result of the inquest. Dr.
Zabala, the Coroner's physician, held an
autopsy upon the body of Kehlenbeck
yesterday morning. He found in the :
stomach some liquid of a nature unknown
and a strange foreign growth, which may
be cancer. Dr. Crackbon was given the
stomach for analysis, and the foreign
growth will also be carefully examined.
Beyond Baying that the case looked sus- ,
picious, Dr. Zabala refused to say what
might be the cause of death.
The only motive that can be assigned
: for foul play is that' Kehlenbeck at the ;
time of his dtath was supposed to have
several hundred dollars in his possession.
and when the body and room were
searched on Monday n<> money was found, j
Wachendorf. it is known, is practically j
without means, and. in fact, as was dis- ;
cover. .1 by Detective Silvey yesterday, he I
was arrested In this city on November 9,
1898, for begging and was given twenty- (
five days in jail. Wachendorf will not !
make any statement for publication, i
: From the actions, uf the two men while
! they were at 315% Jessie street it appears
] that Dr. Wachendorf had Kehlenbeck
1 under the influence of some drug. The
! dead man showed Terry, the proprietor
of the boarding-house, his arm. and it was
covered with punctures, evidently made
iby a hypodermic syringe. He said that
the kind of medicine the doctor was gtv-
I ir.g him was nice, for it made him feel
l free from pain. From what Terry has ,
: to say. he is of the opinion that Wachen- !
i dorf was a drug fiend and he believes he j
| was using some drug upon Kehlenbeck ;
for the purpose of getting him under his ,
power.
John F. Winter, who has a saloon at the
corner of Filbert street and Montgomery
avenue, knew th.< dead man intimately.
He says that he tirst came to this coun
| try from Germany with his family and
Bettled in bÂ»wa, where ai present he has >
a brother living. Kehlenbeck then came
to California and bought or rented a small
ranch in San Luis Obispo County. Pie
haya married sister living there at pres
ent. Kehlenbeck failed there and left the
county owing several hundred dollars. He
came to San Francisco and secured work
as a teamster. When the Overland
Freight Company bought out Kehlen
beck'a former employer they paid him $450
; back wages. Winter says that he knows
that the dead man had this money in his
possession only a short while before his
death, as he was afraid to bank it for
fear that it would be attached by his.cred
itors In San Luis Obispo County.
Kehlenbeck told Terry's daughter that ;
he had a batik account. The Coroner's
deputies declare that they have found re- I
I ceipts that show that the dead man paid
! out over WOO for having his teeth fixed.
j They also have, a receipt to show that he
| paid Dr. Wachendorf p'><* for medical at
tendance. It was with this money that .
the doctor bought the bicycle that he pos-
Besses.
The police are following the theory i
given them in the fact that a bottle of
chloroform was found in the dead man's
room. They believe that Wachendorf
| called In Dr. Fehlin simply as a blind, and
! that after Dr. Fehlln's last visit, when he
found Kehlenbeck In a comatose condi- ,
; tion, Wachendorf administered chloro
form with fatal results. It has been as
j certained that Kehlenbeck was suffering
from a repulsive disease, and that his con- ,
situation was. as far as can be learned,
thoroughly undermined.
Wachendorf still refuses to discuss the '
case.
KNOWN IN STOCKTON.
Dr. Wachendorf Made Himself
Notorious by His Eccen-
tricities.
STOCKTON, June 27.â Dr C. C. J.
Wachendorf, who Is held by San Fran
cisco police while examination Is being
made into his connection with the fatal
Illness of John Kehlenbeck, is well known
In this city. Wachendorf lived heic about
four years and departed three years ago.
He had an office In the Union Block and
built up quite a practice until eccentrici
ties made people afraid to employ his
professional services. In the doctor's of
fice were displayed diplomas from several
schoolsâ European and American. He is
a Russian by birth and Is by all conceded
to be a man of considerable attainments.
He contributed to several leading medical
journals. When be became habitually ad
dicted to the cocaine habit his wife, who
is a beautiful and accomplished woman,
l.ft him. It was as a hypnotist that
Wachendorf was most commented upon.
He was possess, d of wonderful power in
this science, and frequently drove people
from his office by wild gesticulation in
trying to put them under control whether
they would or not.
Finally the drug seemed to unsettle him
entirely. and on one occasion he
threatened to murder a druggist because
the latter would not furnish him with
cocaine. The erratic man would enter
tain crowds on the streets at night with
talks on socialism, of which system he
was an ardent advocate. Some of his
eccentricities were ludicrous, but finally
he became regarded as dangerous and
was locked up by the police. It was
shown that it was cocaine and not ordi
nary insanity which affected him, and he
was accordingly released. After this he
dosed up his office and went into the
country, living with a farmer and treat-
Ing him for some ailment in return for
his board. Later he went to Santa Cruz
and Fresno. From the former place he
wrote to prominent citizens here asking
letters of recommendation.
Those who remember Wachendorfs
predilection for hypnotic experiments do
not doubt hut that the death of his patient
was due to his exercise of this. When in
a normal state Wachendorf was a pleas
ant and agreeable conversationalist. Al
though not yet 40 he had a vast fund of
information " acquired traveling and in
study, asd there are those here who hard
ly believe he would have done anything
criminal unless Impelled by some insane
impulse.

READY TO WELCOME
NEW YORK ARIONS
THE members of the Arion Society have. completed all arrangements
for the entertainment of the New York Arions, who are expected
here on Friday, August 11.
At the meeting on Monday evening of the local society it was de
cided that the great concert arranged for August 12 be held at Odd
Fellows' Hall and $250 was voted to be used for decorative purposes.
The visiting Arions will be met on thfir arrival at the ferry by a dele
gation of the local society and escorted to the Palace, where, in the evening,
a grand serenade with a chorus of over 200 voices will be tendered them.
On Saturday the grand concert will be the feature and on Sunday an
excursion on the bay. For the excursion the steamer Piedmont has been
chai tered.
>.o definite programme has been arranged for the balance of the time the
visitors will spend here, but it is more than probable that a visit to Yo
semite and Del Monte will be in order.
President J. F. Placeman of the local society, assisted by all the members,
is exerting himself to make the stay of the New Yorkers an extremely en
joyable one.

"I'm too thin." answered the drummer
in a doleful voice.

lifting his eyebrows; "what in the name
of the three witches has that got to do
with it?"

controlled only by the limits of the ex

belaisian anecdote."
"Exactly," commented the drummer;
"do I fill the bill?"
"Well, to be frank, old man,' laughed
the sympathizing friend, "you bear about
as much resemblance to the ideal drum

shoe house drummer, lighting a mulatto
stogie "how many of the fellows you
know 'in this business are fat?"
"Not one that 1 know of," answered the
sympathizing friend, after he had re
flected for a few moments.
"Right again." asserted the shoe house
drummer, with a melancholy smile. "Fat
drummers are as rare as flamingoes in

"What's the cause of this sudden melt
ing of all too solid flesh?" asked the sym
pathizing friend. ,
"Oh the revolution in tho methods of
the trade is responsible for it. The boys
of the old school aren't in it nowadays.

"A what?" gasped the sympathizing
friend.
"A parlor entertainerâ a prestidigitatorâ
a conjuring chump. Savvy? "
"I think I do." said the sympathizing
friend, faintly.
"Well that's why the business is going
to the dogs." continued the shoe house
drummer, in a bitter voice. "A fellow
isn't able to sell a bill of goods in the
country now without hypnotizing the

"I should think that there'd be lots of

"Oh. yes. there's no end of fun in it,"

"That's what I thought at first. All the

that same man out for a high ball. But
I've changed my mind. You don't want
to believe those boys. They are willies

enough prestidigitation in mine."
"How so?"
"I was working the sleight-of-hnnrt
racket up in in Rochester a few we^ks
ago," began the shoe house drummer, but
tb" sympathizing friend interrupted him.
"I thought fou only practiced your arts
in the country?" he said.
"Oh. well, it's the same thing," re
marked the shoe house drummer, with a
shrug of his shoulders. "The only differ
ence between Rochester and other country
towns is that Rochester owns a part of

didn't rush in and upnercut him and take

T saw my opening and I sailed in. 'Here,'
says I. producing a silver dollar, 'is a gen

realm, vintage of '92.' and T tossed it on
the counter to prove that it was all wool
and a yard wide. The proprietor looked at
it closely and said it was all right. 'Ri:?ht
you are." says I, and I put It on the tips
of my fingers.

" 'T am.' says he; 'do your worst.'

" 'I'm all eyes.' snvs he.

solemn as a man who reads the ~om;c

" 'Open your list,' I commanded. The old
curmudgeon spread his fingers open
slowly, and, presto! there on his paim

"'A capital trick,' he explained; 'a
capital trick.'
" 'I think so myself,' I said compla

asked.
" 'Oh,' I answered jauntily, 'that was
transmuted into gold by the power of my

into his pocket, 'that beats Billy Bryan's

" 'Here, give me hack my money,' I
gasped.
" 'Your money"' he said, with an air of
astonishment. Oh, yes, to he sure, to be
pure.' And the old guy took a silver dol

The late Mrs. Keeley used to tell the
following story about the visit she paid
to the Queen at Buckingham Palace on I
the occasion of the jubilee In 18S7. Being :
Incredulous of the genuineness of the in- i
vitation, she was disposed to treat the j
royal command as a joke, and wrote a i
rather sarcastic letter to the official, a j
personal friend, who had addressed it to
her. This he gave to the Queen, anil the
veteran actress was a little disconcerted :
when her Majesty told her she had read
the letter. Mrs." Keeley begged that it
should he restored to her. "No, no, Mrs.
Keeley." answered the Queen; "it is safo- j
ly painted in my autograph book. Yoa'll i
never get it again."
On being presented. Mrs. Seeley ere- j
cused herself from making a low curtsey
by saying, "Your Majesty, I have rheu- !
matism in my knees, and I cannot curt- !
sey." "Mrs. Keeley." replied the Queen. >

was put at her ease by the homeliness

A number of dairymen in the vicinity nf

looking for one Charles Bennett, also for
several hundred dollars' worth of cheese
purchased by that individual on repi
tations that proved to be misleading In
the latter part of May Bennett visited The

as manager of the Western Dairymen's
Exchange of 22^ Clay street, of which "J.

business card assisted him in inducing
several of the leading producers of that
section to ship quantities of cheese to the
number and firm named. George Schrep

warded cheese to the value -of $172; R.

telegraphed to this city and inquired re
garding the standing of the Western
Dairymen's Exchange and found that
such" an institution hud no existence; also
that the number. 22* Clay street, is the
business place of L. Dallman & Co.: that
Bennett's only connection with the prem
ises consisted in the fact that he rented
the privilege of having his letters go to
that address; that the name of the ex
change did not appear over the door or
elsewhere, and. further, that the cheese
in question was not sent to the Clay
street establishment.
Mr. Eschenburg came to the city and
engaged M. McCurrie to assist him. At
22S Clay street they were told that Ben
nett, known there only by the name of
Charles Bennett, lived in Oakland. "Hal
stead" was not known at all. After con
siderable trouble they located Bennett's
home at 2124 Eighteenth street. To their
surprise they found that all or nearly all
of the cheese that had been shipped from
Gilroy had been taken from the railroad
and was stored in the basement of the
house. Esohenburp and the detective suc
ceeded after several days in finding Ben
nett. The peculiar cheesemonger waa
"called down" very hard by Eschenburg,
who finally collected the money due him.
By trrts time several other Gilroy cheese
makers put in an appearance and de
manded their pay. They stated that they
did not get the money or'the cheese. In
stead they were told that they would be
paid some time. As a result of their ex
perience it is probable that they will en
deavor to have Bennett arrested for ob
taining goods under false pretense?.
Dallman .& Co. state that when the men
with whom Bennett had been dealing
came to their place of business and told
of the manner in which they had been
deceived they ordered Bennett to leave
their premises and stay away. He picked
up his business cards and promptly com
piled and the present location of the
"Western Dairymen's Exchange" is un
known. However, cheesemakers In other
sections may now have further informa
tion on the "subject.

POSTUM CEREAL.
COFFEE DID IT.
Would Have Been Fatal if Kept Up.
(fee!! () h. how I did want it after
i'the nervous strain of public work.
thing warm to brace me up wa.=
: reakfasi I craved, but every
: tlme I iivhi.U it I suffered the dying
ition that follows it with heart
â¢ring and throbbing of the throat
â  .irs.
I had no strength to throw away in
stray, so decided that hot water
must do for me.
One morning I came to breakfast in
thf- home of some friends in Puebla,
Col., just )n time t<> see thf> mother i
ng some rich, deep yellow coffee)
mugs for the two little boys. One
hap had thrust his fingers in the
and was licking them with such
smacks. This opened the
way : Bay, "Are you not afraid
of the of coffee on the little
folks?" The mother explained that it
was Postuj . Pood Coffee made at Bat-
Creek, Michigan, and remarked,
"We think there is nothing like, it."
Then she explained how the new cof-
fee had weaned them away from the
use of the old-fashioned coffee and tea
because "it is bo wholesome."' I
drank it there for the first time, and
was delighted not only with the deli-
rious flavor, but the after satisfaction
it gives. One day I was shaking with i
pur family physician's wife ahout Pos- j
turn, when her daughter remarked:
V-s, mamma, we are nut of Postum,
;in<V I have used coffee for the last two
mornings and it always brings the tired !
feeling and troubles my stomach and i i
bowels, but Poetum makes me feel all |
right." I
In one home they Berved Postum in j
such- a way that It waa tasteless. Ij i
have found that Postum boiled some-
times live minutes, and sometimes ten, h
is nothing more than spoiled water; but
when it la made with two heaping teas-
poqhsful for each cup and boiled fifteen
or. twenty minutes, it becomes a tried
and proven breakfast favorite, and for :
refreshment and wholesome nourish-
ment has no equal. M. M. Yates, \

CHINESE HIGHBINDER
KILLS HIS ENEMY
Rivalry for the Affections of
a Woman Leads to a De
liberate Mjrder.
cZjyZ CHINESE love affair led to a
II Y^ murder early yesterday morn
/r==\ ln *-
U \^> Shoe Hoon Sein and Ng Tow
Sheong were rivals for the
.t flections of a Chinese belle and Sein
billed Sheong in* order to get him out
of the way.
Sheong was the bookkeeper for the
Chinese firm of Cerro Howart & Co.,
at 227 Clay street and lived on the
premises. Bui is a laborer, and says
it was a case of murder or being mur
dered. About 7 a. m. he went to the
cigar factory and found Ng Vow
Sheong asleep on a cot at the rear of
the cigar factory. "I told him to wake
up and fight, but he wouldn't," said
Shee Hoon Sein, "so I shot him in the
head. He was a heap bad man and
told my girl that he would poison
me."
SI â  â¢â¢ Hoon Sein was killed with the
first shot. It made an ugly wound In
his head, and death must have been
instantaneous. After firing the shot
Sein ran away and was captured on
Sacramento street by Sergeant
Brpphy and charged with murder at
the Harbor police station. The Smith
& Wesson pistol with which he did
the shooting- was booked as evidence
against him.
At the Central police station,
whither he was removed early in the.
day. Shee Hoon Sein readily admitted
that he had killed his rival. He said
that the girl's name was Leng Goo,
and that she was the property of Son
retaryi. L. F. Byington. W. B. Harring
ton, C. D Hobson and .1. P. Dockery.
There was presented a communication
from E. Mulligan, secretary to Archbishop
Riordan. inclosing a check for $25 as a
contribution from the Archbishop to the
fund. His Grace presented his respectful
compliments and wished the work every
success.
Ge rg'e H. ROOS, Leon L. Run? and Rob
ert A. "Boos of Roos Bros, sent a check
for $30 being the second donation from
the firm to the fund. L. B. Murray, N.
Trout and the William Lewis Company
each contributed $5.
The contributions up to date amount to
$3237 SO. airman Greaney reported that
it is probable the contributions from those
who are employed In the City Hall will
amount in the aggregate to between $550
and $600.
Congressman Julius Kalin reported that
the number of volunteers from California
(army and navy) entitled to medals will
number in the aggregate about 9000 men.
I.eng To|. a gambler. The dead man,
according to him. had given I.eng Goo
a powder which she had given to him.
It was to make his love stronger, but
it made him very sick and he nearly
died. Ng Vow Sheong next threatened
to kill him, so he got his gun and
killed his enemy.
When seen in the City Prison the
murderer said that Ng Vow Sheong
was a had man and had caused a hÂ» ap
of trouble, leading one of his coun
trymen to commit suicide. He ad
mitted that he had been ordered to
kill him. He said he belonged to the
Sam Tups, and the murdered man to
the Suey Yups.

PROPOSED TAX
ON STUDENTS
AT BERKELEY
A Special Meeting of
Regents Is Called.
GAGE IS HEARD FROM
LIBERAL CALIFORNIANS ARE
NOT OFFERING ASSISTANCE.
The Governor Pocketed a Bill to Re
imburse Money Advanced to
Help the Destitute
Farmers.
The Board of Regents at a recent
session voted to impose a registration
tax of $20 on each student attending
the university. This measure was
adopted to cover an anticipated deficit
of $47.<iiio. The professors strenuously
objected to any reduction of their sal
aries and the sense of the hoard was
against the abolition of a single exist
ing department of the institution. The
finance committee failed to find a way
other than that nf imposing a tax on
the students. The proposition was vig
orously resisted by Judge Wallace.
John E. Budd and H. S. Foote. hut the
majority of the regents favored it.
When Governor Gage heard what the
regents proposed to do hp wrote a let
ter expressing his dissent and suggest
ing a special meeting to reconsider the
action of the board. Judge Slack, who
voted in favor of the tax. is of the opin
ion that the regents will cheerfully ac
quiesce if some other plan of providing
for the money can be presented. He
supported the measure to tax the stu
dents because he saw no other way to
overcome the deficit. The committee
in preparing the budget found that a
certain Bum of money was required for
the maintenance of each of the depart
ments of the university, and that the
aggregate sum demanded exceeded the
estimated income by $47,000.
In making estimates of the revenue
which the university will d> rive from
the State on the 2-cent tax, the regents
n'eure that the valuation of taxable
property for this year will not show
an increase as compared with last
year's valuation. The alarm of the re
gents may be premature. If the As
sessors of other counties of the State
shall show as much enterprise in the
work of expanding Ih* assessment roll
as the Assess.^ of San Francisco Is dis
playing the university will have a sur
plus rather than a deficit.
Governor Gage may be able to con
vince the regents that the increased
valuation will render the proposed tax
unnecessary. It is noted that the agi
tation for money to maintain the uni
versity has not induced citizens of
wealth and public spirit to signify a
readiness to advance coin on the credit
of the State. Eastern people hearing
so much about our great university
may regard it as rather remarkable
that so much clamor should be made
Of :i small deficit of $47,000. They must
naturally infer that the millionaires of
California do not manifest much con
cern in higher education when no one
offers to help the university. The East
erners may not be advised of the fact
that California recently contributed a
rare specimen to the gallery of freak
Governors, and therein lies the reason
that public spirited men of means are
not offering to assist thÂ» State.
Our freak Governor holds that money
advanced on the credit and honor of
the commonwealth should not be re
paid. The fact will be recorded in the
annals of California that Governor
Budd on the credit of the State pro
cured (25,000 from a generous citizen to
assist settlers in a drought -stricken dis
trict. The money was disbursed by a
commission appointed by the Governor
and consisting of the Mayor of San
Francisco, the president of the Mer
chants' Association and the president
of the State Agricultural Society. The
accounting showed that every dollar
expended went to the relief of some
destitute farmer. Both houses of the
Legislature without dissent passed the
bill to repay the money so advanced
on the credit of the commonwealth.
When the bill reached Governor Gage
he put it in his porket and denied re
payment of the sum advanced. In view
of the transaction, it is not likely that
there will be a rush of liberally in*
clined citizens to assist the State Uni
versity. When money advanced to help
the settlers is not repaid, there can be
no assurance that an advance to as
sist the students will be recognized as
an honorable obligation.

a different story to tell, but there is substantial .
BK"ee:nont In the statement that the European ]
crop is a virtual failure, anil that the yield of
Washington and Oregon will be greatly re
duced. It remains, therefore, fur California
iin.l Srvia to supply the- bulk of the demand j
'-thrdujjhout the world this year, latest reports '
from. Servian dated s^'ir.e two months ago, are j
; tp "the- effect that the output this year is likely j
to.'be' smaller than last ear, though a fair :
â¢â ylt:ld .was then expected. The California, crop |
i it said to promise as well as last year, though j
'Hot; Â¥i> well as the year before. Prices remain
â  BttJady, but there Is no pressure to sell, even
' though the crop outlook is considered favor-
B-Ue,
. â : 'Raisins are unchanged. There is little spot
ijetaand, except ere and there seeders ask for
irnali supplies. The trade seems to be well
Supplied for immediate requirements and no
change in the present situation Is expected, j
: Crop reports continue encouraging and dealers |
'anticipate a good yield at favorable prices. ,
There- has been a report in circulation at dif
ferent limes lately to the effect that the asso- I
elation had made prices on the future product,
It Is probably untrue. It will be remembered
Iliac ho opening prices were made Ist season j
until Just before the actual harvest began; and j
that i the association was not then In as pood
condition to control the crop as it is this year.
Most dealers do not expect opening prices for
t-mie weeks yet. .
â¢ â¢'"'reaches ire unchanged. California will pro
duce more than an average of dried peaches
this year, partly because the crop is larger than
, usual, but more because it will ripen all at the
game time and all methods of preservation will
have to be adopted. There is no spot trading,
but Some inquiry for forward is seen here and
there No opening prices have been made and ]
: Ei<:Â« one will hint hat they are likely to be.
."The situation In apricots is about the same
fÂ»s at last reports. Opening prices are still to
â¢ be made, and the trade experts them to be
lower than the so-called opening price* made '
by speculative exporters to try the market. j
It Is said that considerable Bales for export \
have been made within the past week at
prices closely ip to the publish*--! opening. No
'further particulars are obtainable."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June L'7.â The activity of the
buying ot railroad stacks showed some falling
oft. in the. course of to-day after a notably
active opening and early buying movements.
Bat the demand rung up again in the last
half hour of the trading in full force and car
ried, prjcea of the railroads to the highest of
the; day. New York Ontral was again the
center ..{ interest in the market and it was
a llnal spurt of V& points in that stock that
pave thr- market its strong close. The last
sale of Central wan at 140%. the highest of the
day, and 2\ 2 above last night's cli -â¢â¢ The
late buying of the stock was on a very large
scale, blocks of .i thousand shares and up
ward t-howlng quite frequently on the tape
Manhattan was also rushed un in the final
dealings to 116' ion the announcement of the
closing of contracts, I iking to the chance to
elec-tric motive power. The bull leaders were
evidently In a concerted effort to make final
prices of the day the highest. The separation
of: the trading in the railroads and industrial
ptocks was not quite so sharp as yesterday
Federal steel was conspicuous at the opening
for, an advance of 1% on the dismissal of the
injunction against the payment of the dlvi
n*nd declared on the common stock. Denials
from official sources that any labor trouble
was impending among the etrnet railway em
ployes in Greater .New York also gave an
upward tendency to Hrooklyn Transit and
steel and wire showed some sympathy with
Federal steel, since the directors ot that com
pany had assigned the injunction against the
Federal Steel Company as a reason for not
declaring a dividend on their common stocks
rugar also was disposed to move upward But
the early prices in the steel stocks were the
best of the day and in none of the industrial
stocks were last prices the best. The weak
ness of the specialties and the hardening ten
dency in the money market continued until
the final .upward spurt. The movement in
New \ork Central separated itself more from
other members of the Vanderbllt group than
was the case yesterday and the assertions of
the bull traders that the buying was for ac
count, of insiders was given color by the Dres
ence in the street by W. K. Vanderbllt an
. pvent always made much of by the bulls 'The
Jncreased speculative activity can hardly fail
to add to the already unfavorable bank re-
i u â¢ r " r- ? au V diiy - ln â .â .:.: Bold exports of

The heavy dividend and interest obligations to

LONDON FINANCIAL MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 27.â The Commercial Ad- [
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: !
The markets here were very heavy with the
opening on Mr. Chamberlain's bellicose speech
on the Transvaal, but they rallied later on
second thought that his declarations were
emphatic that President Kruger will have no !
alternative but to surrender. Business was j
Black, but the final tone was fairly good. |
Americans hesitated early, but the country
bought Louisville and Nashville, causing a re
covery, and the dose was at the best on New-
York support. There was more activity in j
this department than there has been lately.
The features were Louisville and Nashville. St. j
Paul and Atchison Issues. Tintos were 44U. I
Anacondas i" T , and money was In good de
mand.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 27.â The action of wheat at
the opening and for a short time after was
anything but encouraging to the bulls. There
was the name story of weal: English and Con
tinental markets, and the same reports of heavy
receipts at primary points that caused wheat
In the past week to break B cents. The open
ing in September was at 7?. l^'Tr73 l V. compared
with yesterday's dosing price of 74'?745c. Th e
liquidation for a time was heavy, holders of
July options being especially prominent In the
.-,. UinC and a lurth<-r decline to 73Hc took place.
This proved to be the bottom, however, and
the stubbornness with which the market re
sisted any further paring of the pricÂ«- gave the
first ray of encouragement to the bulls. Buy
ing against puts stopped the decline and moder
ate covering by shorts resulted in a gradual
advance to 73% c. Before Boon buying was ln
creas<-d by advices from the Northwest that
receipt-- at tli^ two big receiving points will
probably show a material falllnp off next week.
Too much rain was reported in the West and
Northwest. September advanced s-teadlly to

WHEATâ Heavy receipts â  and foreign ad
vices depressed the Chicago market at the
opening, and heavy rains in the northwest
comprised the only bull news. The opinion
gained ground, however, that the decline had
been overdone, and as liquidation has been
general It was about time for a turn, especi
ally as the local crowd was short. A steadier
tone ensued, and under better local support the
market rallied, only to weaken again under
free selling of July at the better figures.
The local market was quiet on the spot, but
futures did better.

rkable Suicide of a Despondent
Pane on the Shores of Lake
Merrittâ uhastly
Find.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. June 27.
l^ara Neilsen, or Hansen, was so anx
ious to die last night that he eougnt
death In three different ways at the sam^
time,
Early this morning Willie Smltn, a
schoolboy, was walking along the east
erly shore of Lnke Merritt when he saw
a man hanging from a tree at the edgy
of the lake. From the man's neck blood
was flowing. The boy at once hurried
from the ghastly scene and told Dr.
Chamberlain, who was walking near tho
lake. The doctor went to the place and
cut the body down, and. seeing at once
that life was extinct, he communicated
with the Coroner.
â¢ At first glance It was not easy to see
â whether the suicide had died from throat
cutting or hanging. Netlsen or Hansen
had made very determined preparations
to die. He had cut his throat, only lust
missing the jugulur, and had placed tho
bloody razor In his coat pocket. He had
then procured a rope that hau been used
to tether a cow and had turned "â  ani
roai*loose bo that he might <>!' ihe
means to end his Ufa. He then * ii'>ed
on the branch of a tree at the w.i'-.-i's
edge, fastened one end of the cow's rope
around the inch and the other around
his gaping, bleeding throat. He then
rolled off and waa strangled. Had th"
rope broken he would have fallen into
the lake and -what the razor and the
rope could not accomplish the green
waters of Lake Merritt would have done
Quickly.
Some people who had known Xeiisen or
Hansen stated that he was an industrious
man. who worked as a coachman and
fayed his money. Some time ago h? spec
ulated in stocks and it is supposed lie lost
Ills savings and became despondent.
Nearly $-10 In coin was In his pockets.
An Inquest was held to-night and it was
d by the autopsy physician .hat
ised bj strangulation. Th

SMALL BOY DROWNED
IN THE TIDAL CANAL
FELL FROM A FLOATING LOG
AND MET DEATH.
There Were No Eye-Witnesses to the
Accident. Although the Shore

ALAMEDA. June 27.-Joseph Godfrey.!
an llfyfar-old lad. lost his life at about!
lV:00. o'clock: â  Us morning in the waters i
[of fh.> tidal canal. No one saw him fall j
.into the water, but the air bubbles and:
ring* that roiÂ»e to the surface marked th.- !
; ir i Â»< Â» t â â â â¢â¢â â  the boy had disappeared and i
told too plainly his fate.
: He had been playing on a line of logs
that were chained together and strung '
across the mouth of the canal to keep the i
loos;e;-logs from drifting into the estuary.
The. .-nild was walking on this line when
â¢he disappeared. It is presumed that he
off Into the water and was car
ried under the log jam by the Inflowing
. tide, which was running strong.
People near by on the shore heard no
outcry or splash. Noticing that he had
disappeared they cried out the boy's name
; in th>Â± hope he might have reached the!
other shore and was hiding, but they re
ceived no answer. The lad parents, Mr.
and Mrs. Dennis Godfrey, who live on
Bank street, near Park, were informed of
the tragedy and were almost prostrated.
Trey are poor and unable to hire any one
to arch for the remains. Friends of the
family and acquaintances of the little fel
i low have been patrolling the banks of the i
canal since the drowning, but up to a j
late hour to-night the body had not been
recovered.

KEATING'S JOB
HANGS UPON A
POLITICAL DEAL
Was Recommended
by Hart North.
TOM CRAWFORD'S POSITION
ALSO FIGURES IN A LITTLE
COMBINATION.
A Resignation From the Insane War
den Would Simplify Matters
and Save Embarrass
ment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 27.
. It Is a long: way from the insane annex
I of the Receiving Hospital to the office of
â¢ the Immigration Commissioner in San
! Francisco, but the political bridge be
j tween them is short. The attempt to re
j move "William Keating from the position
; of warden of the insane does not depend
: so much on the charges made against him
as on a political deal of the seesaw order
with Keating on one end and Tom Craw
ford on the other.
About a year ago a job was wanted for
Keating:. He had been particularly use
ful to Hart North In the Fourth Ward,
when North was running for the Assem
-1 bly, and naturally North was under obli
! gations to him. The opportunity to repay
this obligation came when North was ap
pointed Immigration Commissioner by
McKinley and had the dispensing of the
! patronage of that Federal office.
I Tom Crawford at that time was also in
a position where he could fill a vacancy
without canceling any engagements and
he had some strong political friends in
i this city to whom Hart North was also
indebted and who were Indebted to him In
a political sense. Crawford was ap
| pointed a deputy in Hart North's office
> and is still there. North's protege, Keat
\ ing, was appointed to an office just cre
i ated at the Receiving Hospital. Now that
' a right has developed to oust Keating
North has intimated that the putting out
. of the Insane warden may result in the
appointment of a successor to Tom Craw
ford This little arrangement is not at
all acceptable and if Keating should be
discharged by the Supervisors it is likely
that he will be taken care of somewhere
! else.
Saturday afternoon Keating will have
a trial before the Supervisors. But it
would not surprise any one should he re
sign before that time. There are many
arguments that might be advanced why
Keating should not have a trial and
should spare certain Supervisors the un
i pleasantness of having to vote to either
i retain or discharge him.

i .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, June 27.
The Mayor spoke softly, Mr. Dow
whispered and City Engineer Clement
merely emitted a sound which was not
always clear enough for Secretary Jack
son to record without asking for a re
petition. The meeting of the Board of
, Public Works occupied about twenty
minute?; this morning.
The programme carried out was exactly
as published in Th*> Call a week ago. Mr.
Snow did not vote to re-elect Street Super
i intendent Miller, although he signified
that if he were let alone and not bothered
lie would do so in the future. James
Brannan, special police, officer, was not
j dismissed, and will not be until the new
1 Chief has had an opportunity to report on
! the propriety of such a move. Foreman
'â  John Rohan of the Firo Department was
, not dismissed, the Mayor hinting that he
1 had watched Rohan's work during the
past few weeks ami felt that his retire
, ment would not be for the good of the
â department. Charles Hammerton a-as not
I promoted from patrolman to detective, the
Mayor claiming that there Is no vacancy
among the detective force.
Everything Mr Dow had proposed was
frowned upon by the other two members.
the Mayor very plainly indicating by his
answers that Mr. Dow's resolutions were
for political effect ar.d not for the good
of the departments affected. He also
hinted that it is poor policy fit this time
to manipulate the Police Department in
any direction, as Chief Hodgklns will take
office next Saturday, ann he should be
j left alnne to manage the department and
make roromm<-ivlutlons regarding any
needed changes.
Au attempt was made by Mr. Dow tc
have a man named Beers substituted foi
Mike Hallahan as a member of the de
partment, but Hallahan won out by Lb<
i'otea if Snow and Clement. The attempi
to abolish Hi-- office at clerk to the Chi-i
of Poll c was laid over till the next meet
ing. After the board declined to dismiss
Brannan. Mr. Dow withdrew his resolu

the members for next Thursday night to

FOUGHT A STUFFED OWL.
Did the Cat, and Is Dead as the Re-
suit of the Fracas.
On the showcase of the H. & D. Fol
som Arms Company, where Mr. Selbold
Is general" manager, stood a handsome
owl, stuffed and mounted. The top of his
head was 24 Inches from the glass. Price,
$9. Prowling lazily through the store and
basement, lord of all he surveyed, always
comfortably purring, was an honest tom
cat the pride and mascot of the estab
lishment. He watched the premises at
night and helped to open the door in the
morning Yesterday when Mr. Seibold
arrived for duty he found the floor three
inches deep In feathers, and Mr. Owl was
not in his accustomed place. Tom also
was missing. He did not help open the
door. The police were called In for an
investigation. 'â :;.â  â '. .. ,
In the course of the day the owl was

savage attack was begun. Clawfuls of
feathers flew. The owl never blinked.
The steady shine of his eyes aggravated
the situation. The cat ripped and tore.
Off came the left wing, then the breast
was lacerated, then the neck was laid
bare Over and over on the showcase the
combatants rolled. Suddenly both fell to
the floor, where the battle was continued.

Poisoning cases are in the air. Imagine

Could any situation be funnier? I can
not describe it. But the Coroner decided
that Tom came to his death by swallow

taxidermist In the body of the owl to pre

SAYS SHE WAS
DEFRAUDED OF
VALUABLE LANDS
Feronica Miller Sues
T. B. Draper.
CHARGES OF FRAUD ARE MADE
GAVE MONTEREY ACRES FOR
LOTS IN ALAMEDA.
She Charges That She Was Prevented
From Searching Title to Land
Mortgaged for Nearly Its
Whole Value.
Oakland Office San Francipco Call,
90S Broadway, June 27.
But yesterday Feronlca Miller was the j
owner In fee simple of 228 acres of land
In Monterey County, being a portion of
the Rancho Bolsa Nueva y Moro Cojo or
Castro grant, worth f-6500 at the lowest
estimate. To-day she filed suit In the
Superior Court of Alameda County
against T. B. Draper, the well-known con
tractor and builder, residing 1 in Alameda,
for the recovers' of the property out of
which she allegi-s she has been bunkoed.
According tv her complaint T. B. Draper ]
recently expressed a desire to exchange ;
his property on Willow street and Eagle :
avenue, Alameda. for the Monterey Coun- i
ty land, which is free from all incura
brances. Draper, she says, represented to I
tier that his Alameda property was worth
$8500, incumbered by a mortgages for $1100 i
and no more. The deal was closed yes
terday afternoon and the respective deeds I
were shortly afterward recorded in both
counties.
Mrs. Miller alleges that Immediately
after the recording of the deed for the
Draper property she discovered that all.
of the defendant's representations and
stati ments concerning the" mortgage upon
his i r perty were false; that In truth and
In f;iri the property is incumh"re.l by
mortgages amounting in the aggregate to
S3100; also that the property instead of be
ing worth JSSOO as represented by Draper
Is of no greater value than $4000. .
Plaintiff avers "that said false and
fraudulent statements and representa
tions were made for the purpose of de
ceiving plaintiff and with fraudulent ln
teni of inducing her to convey to him her
Monterey property."
She charges, too, that she was prevent
ed from examining the title of the Draper
property and from consulting an attorney
in reference to the same, Draper repre
senting this to be unnecessary and that
it would incur great expense.
Mr.-<. Miller is past sixty years of age
and ran neither read nor write the Eng
lish language. She asks, through her at- j
torney, that the derd to her Monterey
land be canceled, "ffering to reebnvey to j
Draper his property.
STOCK TICKERS.
E,un for the Exclusive Us 3of Women
Speculators.
A stock room run exclusively for wo
nifn Is doing a thriving business on the
eighth floor of Exchange Court. 62 Broad
way. Its patrons are all apparently well
to-do women, with a few girls bent on
doubling their allowances.
Tho name on the door is "Fred G.
Smith," and although it does not appear
on the building directory, the presence of
the women's stock room is well known
in the neighborhood.
Within the room, which is plainly fur
nished with a dark blue carpet, are a
woman's desk, a Japanese screen and
many rocking chairs. One waJI )s largely
occupied by a large blackboard for stock
quotations. One corner of the room is
railed off for a couple of men. One slight
and middle aged was called Mr. Smith.
He handled t lie telephone.
A blonde girl mounted on a tall stool
beside the ticker read from the tape.
called out the quotations, sympathized
with losers and braced up faint hearts.
Two women In shirt waists and white
aprons chalked prices on the blackboard.
Both were past the first youth. The little
one was called "Miss Smit.i," and be
tween chalks went behind the Japanese
screen and made iced tea and lemonade
for the customer?.
None of the patrons seemed particularly
lucky. "Miss Cozzens," a plump young
woman In a blue shirt waist, was de
spondent. "B. R. T." in some way had
proved h<*r undoing. Tho twenty-two wo
men one after t'i>- other offered her con
solation. All bill one.
"You ought not to have done that, any
way," said a large woman. "Tou'il lose
every time that way. The only way to
beat , this game down here is to play both
long and short. I'm going to use ray other
name. I've been married twice, you
know, and I'll use one name for 'short'
and the other for 'long.' "
"When will you (md out about sugar,
Mr. Smith?" said the woman Impatiently.
'â When is that dividend?"
A sedate woman murmured to her com
panion, "I'd no more touch sugar than a
red-hot poker."
Just thr-n Mr. Smith suggested to "Mrs.
Townsend" that it was a good time for
her to buy, and "Mrs. Townsend" obedi
ently fillrd out a blank she found on the
table. Soon Mr. Smith told her the price
at Which she had bought.
"Well, I'm even oa the day. anyway,"
said another woman to a friend three
rocking chairs away.
"Here's sugar," cried Mr. Smith, as he
listened to the telephone. "The dividend
will he announced to-morrow."
"Good!" cried the woman, rising from
her rocking chair. "And how much will
it be. Mr. Smith?"
But Mr. Smith raised both hands at the
very idea of his being suspected of hav
ing any such valuable information, and
the rest of the crowd promptly subdued
the woman with a Jeering laugh. The
room settled down to wait for closing
prices while the blonde girl monotonously
repeated ticker prices and "Miss Smith"
covered the blackboard wiui figures.
One woman saJd the room had been
open for some time and that nothing less
than $100 margin would be taken.â New

ARTIFICIAL SILK.
Discovered Again, and This Time
Cheaper Than the Heal Thing,
To prepare by artificial moans a substi
tute for the silk fiber which should pos
sess the strength and beautiful luster
characterizing: the natural product of the
silkworm has long been the aim of a
great number of technical chemists. Un
til quite recently, however, the competi
tion with nature could hardly be looked
upon as successfu). There has just been
brought to success in Glasgow, however,
a process by which the properties of nat
ural silk which art' of practical value can
be reproduced in a fiber ousting but little
to manufacture.
The Inventor states that the artificial
product, known as "Vanduara silk," can
be manufactured a 6 a cost of only 38 6d
per pound. When It is remembered tbat
the better qualities of natural silk sell at
from 15a to 19s per pound, it is at once
evident that the new process leaves con-
Blderable margin for profit.
The liber Is prepared by ejecting fine
threads of a strong solution of gelatine
from very small orifices on to an endless
band conveying them to bobbins, on
which they are reeled. After leaving the
small orifices, the gelatine solidifies in a
continuous fiber, a thousandth of an inch
in diameter, possessing a luster even
greater than that of natural silk.
The fiber in this state, however, is un
suitable for use, as it is easily spoiled
by water. In order to render it imper
vious, it is water proofed by a special
process, which docs not Interfere in the
least with the silky appearance of the
fiber. In its final state "Vanduara silk"
can be dyed any color, and takes the
dye much more brilliantly than ordinary
silk.
In one point only is the artificial fiber
inferior to the genuine articleâ viz.. Its
strength. But although "Vanduara silk"
does not wÂ»ar so well as pure silk, it is
claimed that it is equal in Quality to
most silks on the market, which as a
rule have been deteriorated by adulter
ation. Many manufacturers who have
tried it are quite satisfied with its dura
bility.
An attempt was made in France to pro
duce an artificial silk of commercial value
and Dr. Lehner of Zurich turned out a
beautiful fabric, iiut as the cost was
from 9s to 10s per pound the British arti
cle has little danger of suffering from for
eign competition.
There is. too, especial source of grati
fication In the new process, since much
of the dyeinK of silk has ot late years
been taken from the hands of British
firms and transferred to those of Conti
nental dyers, especially those of Ger
many.âLondon Daily Mail.

EFFECT OF THE DEAL
IN THE WINE SYNDICATE
Outsiders Think Growers Are Better
Off Outside the Corporation or
Association.
NEW YORK. Jure 27.â One of the larg
est California wine merchants in this cit?
said to-day that the. relations between
the Wine-makers' Corporation and the
Vv inemakers' Association had not bene
fited the small or modest dealers and i
winegrowers. Continuing he said:
"An arrangement between the two or
ganizations would he al! right if the as- j
sociatlon did not have the first choice of ;
wines controlled by the corporation, but |
what chance is there now for dealers who
are not in the association or for wine
makers to dispose of their product if it
has been rejected by the association
members who have celected the corpora
tion's choicest wines? The maker of good
wine is, to my mind, better off outside- the
corporation because he enn then dispose j
of his goods if he wishes to independent
merchants, or, In other words, lie would
have an open market for his wines."

W. Russell, an insurance man of this

for $0000 damages for injuries received
while using one of the company's tele
phones on the 15th of May. While Mr.
Russell was talking through the tele
phone he was cut off and switched onto
another line. He notified the operator of
the fact and In return received an imper
tinent answer, followed by a shock which
threw him across the room, partially par
alyzing and otherwise injuring him to
such an extent as to render it impossible
for him to attend to his duties for two
weeks.

company, alleges the shock was caused
by a live wire coming into contact with
the line, which gave a shock to both the
operator and Mr. Russell. The complaint
sets forth that the operator connected a
buzzer with a current of electricity which
was of heavy voltage.

TOYO KISEN KAISHA'S STEAMER NIPPON MARU IN QUAR
ANTINE AT ANGEL ISLAND.
NIPPON MARU
PASSENGERS ARE

Plague en Route.
NO ONE LANDED AT HONOLULU
PASSENGERS WENT ABOARD AN
OTHER STEAMER.
The Vessel Will Dock To-Morrow, but
the Cabin and Steerage Unfor
tunates Will Be Held
Seven Days.
The Toyo Risen Kaisha's steamer Nip
pon Maru arrived from Honolulu yester
day ni"rn::-.E and was at once placed in
â  li tine. No one was allowed on board
ami L'nited States Quarantine officer Dr.
J. .7. KJnyoun Issued strict orders against
anything b< Ing sent ashore.
The Nippon Maru sailed from Hongkong
foj H;in Francisco on .Mj\ .4. and two
days later a <': I erage passenger
ikon sick with what wa -
to be bul i â¢-. Two days bei r<
the' steamer reached Nagasaki the Mongol
died and the Japanese authority a |
the vessel in quarantine. She was not re
basf.d until June 3, and then a start was
made for Honolulu via Yokohama.
On June 14 another Chinese died and
three days later the Nippon Maru reached
Honolulu. The Hawaiian Board of Health
would not accept the report of the phin's
surgeon and the embalmed body of the
Chinese was examined. Dr. Day pro
noum ed it a death from bubonic plague
and Dr. Carmichael agreed with him. A
portion of the body was secured and sub
mitted to Dr. Alvarez, the bacteriologist
for the Hawaiian Board of Health, and
he had no difficulty In discovering the
bacillis of the bubonic plague. That set
tled the Nippon Maru. as far as Hawaii
was concerned. Her passengers were re
fused, a landing even in quarantine and
her. freight was not accepted.
It locked at first as though the steamer
would have to come on to San Francisco
with her Hawaiian freight and passen
gers and take her chances here. Her
agents, however, succeeded in chartering
the steamer City of Columbia and with
the permission of the. Hawaiian authori
ties that vessel was anchored In the
stream and the Nippon Maru transferred
her passengers and cargo. She was
coaled and watered by lighters and on
June 19 Bailed for San Francisco.
The Nippon Maru lias the following
cabin passengers for this port:

HOTEL NYMPHIA AGAIN.
The Obnoxious Scheme Bobs Up Only
to Be Defeated.
The Hotel Nymphia Bcheme camp up
before the Fire Committee of the Board
pervisors in a new guise yeÃterday,
and upon its being exposed was definitely
knocked nut. Hannah Bros., contractors,
nought permission to make certain repairs
to the building at 1108 to U24 Stockton
street, which it was represented was in
an exceedingly bad condition. One of the
members of the firm denied that it was
a revival of the Hotel Nymphia scheme
and said it was merely Intended to place
the property in good repair for the pres
ent tenants.
A number of church organizations,
represented by Attorney Barrett, pro
on the ground that the application
whs merely a scheme to carry out the
hotel project by altering the building
piecemeal. Rev. Father Caraher. Rev. Mr.
Urmy and others spoke against granting
rmlt, and the committee denied the
petition.
The bills aggregating over (8000 for cable ;
f.>r the t;r>- alarm and police telegraph
underground circuit, which Supervisor
Perrault laid before the board on Monday
and which were referred to the Fire Com
mittee, were referred back to the Finance
Committee with the recommendation that
they be paid. Superintendent Hewitt
explained the deficiency caused by the |
purchase of cable by saying that he or
dered the cable but it could not be de
livered at the time. Thinking that it I
would not be ready for delivery until
after the beginning of the next fiscal year.
he had spent the balance of the $20.f>00 in '
laying conduits. The cable had arrived :
ahead of time and consequently would
have to be paid for now or not at all.
Fire Chief Sullivan reported adversely
on the petition of certain Chinese firms
to maintain wire screens in front of the â 
windows of the premises occupied by I
them; accordingly the committee reported
adversely to granting the permits.
JURORS' DEMANDS ARE
STILL IN LITIGATION
SUPREME COURT SAYS THEY
ARE NOT URGENT.
The Lower Tribunal Must First Pass
on the Claims and the Matter
Be Determined on Appeal.
The Supreme Court has refused to con
sider the application for a writ of man
date to be directed against the Super
visors to compel the auditing of jurors'
demands as a matter of urgency, and
hence has refused to issue the writ as
prayed for. In consequence proceedings
will now be Instituted In the Superior
to compel the auditing of the de
mands, but owing to the action of City
and County Attorney I,ane In refusing to
Instruct the b^.ard to abide by the de
cision of the Superior Court some time
will be occupied on appeal before the Su
preme Court.
It was understood at the time of the re
jection rif the claims by the Board of Su
pervisors that a decision of the Superior
court upon the question involved would
be sufficient authority for the future ac
tion of the board. In consideration of
this a proceeding was brought by Attor
ney L. P. Board man before Judge Cook
to have the matter decided. On further
consideration the Hoard of Supervisors
and their advisors concluded that if Judg
ment went in favor of the jurors in this
proceeding they would appeal the case
to thfl Supreme Court.
In order to obviate the delay which
would follow from an appeal in the ordi
nary course of proceedings the case in
the Superior Court was dropped and on
Saturday last application was made to
tiiÂ« Supreme Court for an original writ
of mandate to compel the Supervisors to
act favorably on the claims. The Supreme
Court will not issue this kind of a writ
where application may also be made to
the Superior Court in the first Instance,
except in cases of extreme emergency,
and It was claimed in this case that un
leES the question involved here should be
determined lief ore the expiration of the
present fiscal year the fund in tho treas
ury of the city which had been formerly
set aside for the payment of these fees
might be transferred and the Jurors left
without any remedy] In denying the ap-
Uon for the writ the Supreme Court
virtually holds that the claims of the
jurors are statutory and not liable to be
paid out of any particular fund, but are
payable out of the general fund If the
city is liable for their payment at all.
The case having been relieved of all
elements of urgency by this considera
tion, proceedings will now be instituted
anew in the Superior Court and the case
appealed without delay and an early de
cision Is expected.
CORPSE AND COFFIN
Thrown From the Wagon and the
Horse Killed.
A team driven by a tenmster for T^otils i
Arata. liveryman. 716 Pacific street, which I
was taking a Chinese corpse to the Chi- I
nese Cemetery, ran away on Pine and '
Dupont streets yesterday afternoon. The
driver held on to the reins as long as h<
couUl but could not restrain the terrified j
animals. The runaways dashed down I
Dupont street to Sutter and along Sutter i
to L'avenworth, where they turned south !
and at the corner of Post street the I
wheels struck a telegraph post and over- |
turned the wagon. A Chinese who was i
Bitting on top of the coffin was thrown !
to the Btreet with the coffin, which was
smashed in pieces und the corpse rolled
out. The wagon was wrecked and one of
the horses killed.
Dr. Lawlor, the new Health Officer, and '<
Officer Hutterworth happened to pass at :
the time, and, acting under the doctor's
Instructions, a new coffin was procured i
and the body conveyed to the cemetery.
THE SAW FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 28, 1899.
THE SEA LIONS
MAY YET BE
THINNED OUT
Eastern Sportsmen
Interested.
A DAY AT THE FARALLONES
THE ROOKERIES INSPECTED BY
I>. C. A. STROTHER,
He Was Greatly Amazed at the Great
Size and Large Numbers of
the Wolves of the
Pacific.
There was an expedition to the Faral
lon Islands yesterday that is likely to
have some bearing upon the question of
killing sea lions, as a means of preserving
the food fish and especially the salmon,
in the near future. A number of gentle
men, whose reports and views on this
subject will have a certain weight at
Federal headquarters, went to the islands
as the guests of Captain U. Sebree. the
'lighthouse inspector of this district.
Principal among them was A. T. Vogel
sang, chairman of the State Fish Com
mission; Deputy A. W. Wilson, and Lan
celot C. A. Strother, a scientific gentle
man and sportsman recently from the
East. '
In order that the importance of the visit
to the home of the seal herds may be un
derstood it must be remembered that a
couple of months ago the State Fish Com
missioners were urged by the river fish
ermen to take steps toward reducing the
sea lions, which are killing thousands of
pounds of food lish, to say nothing of
the loss of nets costing from two to four
hundred dollars. Permission was obtained
from the Federal authorities at Washing
ton to carry out the plan laid down and
a number of expert rifle shots were sent
to the Farallon Islands and to the rook
eries near the bay. It was also decided
not to do much killing until the breeding
se;LS"n opened in June, when the animals
have less I't-ur for the hunters and their
guns.
About the time the real work was to
have commenced the permission by Uie
Federal authorities was suddenly revoked
on account of a few protests sent to the
Treasury Department by a number of
Eastern sentimentalists and the League
of American Sportsmen, who seemed to
have an idea that the thinning out meant
the extermination of the sea lion herds
of the entire coast. Mr. Vogelsang at once
wrote to the people at Washington pro
testing against the latest action and de
nouncing the interference of those who
were not familiar with the situation here.
The force of his argument seemed to have
some weight, for when Mr. Strother head
ed for the West several members of the
league expressed the wish to have tne
views of an enthusiastic sportsman upon
the situation. As it was about the time
for Captain Sebree to make his regular
trip to the islands he. invited the gentle
men to go out with him.
The lighthouse tender Madrona left the
city at 7 o'clock yesterday morning, and
in due time was piloted to the islands by
Master Davies. T'nder the care of Cap
tain W. A. Beeman the party was taken
to the big rookery on what is known as
the Saddle Rock, where the main breed
ing ground is located. At this season of
the '.ear the large males are particularly
savage, and unless a gun is used they pre
vent man from putting foot on the rocks.
As shooting had been prohibited the party
was obliged to view the situation from a
distance. The rock covers an area of
several acres and from the top to the
water's edge every part was occupied by
"king bulls," females and hundreds of
pups.
Mr. Strother was astonished at the
enormous size of the sea lions. Tie stated
that the Impression of the protestants in
the East Ik that these animals are about
the same size as those exhibited in the
zoological gardens, something over four
feet long. Those he saw yesterday run
from eight to fourteen feet in length and
weigh from 1200 to 3000 pounds.
Several of the larger ones measured over
three feet through the. neck six inches
back of the ears. It was estimated that
on the Saddle Rock alone there were
fully 2500 sea lions, to say nothing of the
young, which were very numerous. From
there the steamer took tho party to the
North Farallones, four huge rooks which
are several miles to the north. The same
condition of aTfairs was found to exist
there, only that the sea lions were more
numerous. The rocks were covered with
the fish killers, and more were ooming.
A rough estimate by the members of the
party placed the total number of seals in
sight at over 9000. A short run was mode
to tho rookeries at Point Reyes, but the
rocks were deserted.
Mr. Strother states that the people of
the East have no conception of the situa
tion here. While he did not say what re
port he will make to his friends, it Is safe
to say that if his arguments have any
weight the prohibition to killing will be
raised next season. It is very likely that
the personal observations of Mr. Vogel
sang will be sent to the authorities at
Washington.
Mr. Strother will next visit the rook
eries to the south in a day or so. From
the rookery below Half Moon Bay he ex
pects to secure the head and shoulders of
one of the large bull sea lions to send to
his friends in the East for Inspection.
The specimen will eventually find lodg
ment in one of the institutions of learning
at Toronto, Canada.
WANTS HER SALARY.
Eleanor Giusti Sues Manager South
well for $202.
Mlpb Eleanor Giusti apparently changes
her mind as frequently as she does her
stage costumes. Miss Giusti, who is a
San Francisco girl, returned to her native
city with the Southwell Opera Company,
under contract to fill an engagement of
fifteen weeks at the Grand Opera-house.
Along in May Miss Giusti withdrew from
the company, she Fays because of a se
vere cold, hut the other Fide says because I
of her refusal to submit to the discipline j
of the s=t;ts:e. At any rate. Miss Giusti I
has brought suit In the Justice's Court
against Manager Southwell for $202, which
she claims to be due her. An attempt was
made to levy on Southwell's interests j
here, but it was found he had transferred ,
them all to Walter Morosco and is now on
his way East.
Rumors of the contemplated s\ilt were
afloat some time a^ro, but Miss Giusti I
positively denied that she intended taking
any such step.
MINNIE ADAMS' TRIAL.
Prosecution Still Offering Evidence j
Before Judge Lawlor.
The trial of Mrs. Minnie Adams, chared j
with the murder of her infant son, John
Richard Gray, was continued before
Judge Lawlor yesterday. Mrs. Lena !
Kenny, whose name has been frequently
mentioned in connection with the case,
was the first witness called yesterday.
The witness testified that she was called I
to the house immediately after the child i
had swallowed the poison, and she ad- j
ministered mustard and water and salt
and water in an effort to make the child
throw off the poison. As this brought no
relief, a physician was sent for and he
attended the child until it died. She also
said that the child's face was severely !
: burned by the acid, and then left the ;
I stand.
Dr. H. A. Niemeyer, who attended the !
| child, was next called to the stand. He '
! said that when he reached the dying in- j
1 fant's bedside it was frothing at the j
: mouth and very close to death, He at ,
: once administered an antidote, but with- '
out avail.
L. K. Thrasher, at present United States
storekeeper and ganger at Antioch, but
i who at the time of the crime was a jour
i nalist, testified as to having been shown a
paper permeated with carbolic acid which
was found in the lavatory at the Adams
home, his testimony in a measure cor
roborating the prosecution's theory that
â  Mrs. Adams took the child into the lava- j
i tory and administered the poison to him.
; Dr. Zabala was on the witness stand when
j the case closed for the day. i
THE BASTILE'S FALL.
French Colony Preparing for a Great
Celebration of the Event.
The French colony of San Francisco
is making arrangement p for a proper cele
bration of the 14th of July. The executive
committee, of which A. Legalet is presi
dent, J. S. Brim vice president, .Tuels Go
deau treasurer and A. B. Rlchet secre
tary, held a meeting Monday night in the
rooms of the Cercle Francaise and dis
cussed plans for the celebration. It was
decided that it shrill be held at the
Chutes; that there shall rip a naval battle,
literary exercises in the afternoon, includ
ing an address by Mayor Phelann and the
singing of the "Star-Spangled Banner"
by Mme. Coursen-Roeckel. The other feat
ures have not yet been decided upon. The
festivities will close with fireworks and a
grand ball in the evening.
He Alleges Malpractice.
William L. Brown filed suit yesterday
against the Societe Francalse de liien
faisance Mutuclle to recover $20,000 dam
ages for malpractice. Plaintiff alleges
that r,n November 27, 1597, he suffered a
fracture of the leg. He went to the
fendant hospital for medical treatment
but was bo unskillfully treated that the
fracture failed to unite. Hence the suit.

DRAGGED IN THE MIRE
OF DAN BURNS' SHAME
Leon Dennery Chosen Secretary of
the Board of Health.
The Mexican's Creatures Obay His Commands to the
a Motley Herd Appointed to Administer
Health Affairs for the City.
EHE Board of Health presented
â  â  last night :i spectacle of in
decent, official degradation that
I Is perhaps without parallel in
" the history of the city. The
members of the board drank the nau
seating dose of blackguard patronage
presented to them by Dan Burns, and
rined in disgust even at their own
/actions. : They, were forced to sacrifice
their, personal and professional reputa
tions, to dishonor themselves in the
: ?y<?s of their friends and of the public,
.;to cover themselves with humiliating
shame and appoint to public office the
ruffianly crew selected by their political
master. .
The scene was pitiable in a public
place. It seemed an act of gratuitous
maliciousness to force decent men so
to debase themselves at the dictation
<>f a political outlaw. But the mem
bers of ..the board had to submit. If
they had not done so Burns would have
dismissed them from their positions as
contemptuously as he would discard a
shoe which did not fit him. The mem
bers of the Board <>f Health are his
creatures and their only pledge and as
surance of official station is their syco
phancy to him.
So they became last night his official
lackeys. They placed themselves cheek
by Jowl with the unspeakable Dennery,
lifting his disgusting personality Into
their own nest. They brushed shoul
ders In fraternal goodfellowshlp with
the 111-smelling, vile-mouthed, foul
brained denizens of the tenderloin who
become public servants because they
are in the train of Burns. The mem
bers of the board followed their in
structions to the letter. Each was pro
vided with a typewritten list of ap
pointments and each in turn proposed
shamefacedly the name of a favorite of
the Mexican for an allotted position.
There was no deviation, no suggestion
â  of independence of action.
As a spectator marked "It is bad
enough to submit to the indignity of
â¢ another man's lash, but it seems to me
the' limit of endurance is passed when
.'ft man must drag himself through the
mir.e of another man's shame and then
exhibit himself to public scorn." But
the Mexican's command had been given
find it was obeyed. The programme as
foreshadowed in The '"all was carried
out with one exception.
.Long before the meeting was called
tn order the rooms of the board were
crowded by a motley herd, whose pres
ence made it necessary frequent to
open the windows as a measure of
sanitary precaution. At 9 o'clock the
board convened. After the transac
tion of some routine business Dr. Cof
fey arose, and hesitatingly moved to
declare the position of secretary va
cant. There was a buzz of expectancy,
and Secretary Dunne presented a
written protest against removal. It
was ignored, and Secretary Dunne's
officialhoad was decapitated.
Then fo.llowed one of the dramatic :
â incidents of the session. Dr. Coffey
moved that Leon ] 'â¢â¢!â  !.â¢â¢!â ;. be appoint
ed to. fill the vacancy. There was a
murmur of surprise In the room. The
sound- seemed to strike Dr. Coffey like
a ; 'blow. His face flushed until it was
crimson, and some one said pityingly
that the young physician was not yet
altogether lost to shame. He probably
fe.]twhat the name of Dennery typi
,fies,-'and he is not yet ready to accept
. tho-:cnnsequencvs of his own action.
He-is not yet ready to admit thai since
.; he .â â <!!<] not raise Dennery to his own
level, he has sunk to thai of Dennery.
.... Dr. < 'offey sal down and Leon Den
â¢ riery was unanimously elected secre
tary. Mayor Phelan was not there
and did not attend during the evening. |
: .Dr-rihery's friends, us a matter of j
course, are gratified at his appoint- i
merit. They take it as a vindication!
Â«>f is manner and method of life.
Four reputable physicians have made
him their official equal, arid it is only \
â  an imaginary line that divides the offi
cial .from the Individual. As an equal
of the members of the Board of
Health, it is suggested that Dennery
be dined by I >â â  boa at the home of
John. I. Sabin, th father-in law â â â¢ Dr.
Payne, ' for . example, in honor of the re
habilitation of 'â 'â â  tenderloin's most
disgusting representative.
After the. election of Dennery the ap
pointments came quickly. The next in '
Importance was that of Assemblyman
L.. A. Devoto to succeed J. p. Dockery
as .Chief Food Inspector. All thai 1 >â â¢
VOtO knows about food is to eat it. His
qualification for the position to which
he has been chosen is thai he voted
..for Burns for Senator and will do so
again at the extra session of the Legis
lature. The position of Food Inspector
is the bribe of allegiance to the Mexi
can.
The next head to fall was that of
Ben Davis, the Market Inspector. The
prize went to William Gans, a friend
of Senator Eddy Wolfe. In the ap
pointment of Gans there is a disap
pointment. The place was promised
by Burns to Mike Dunn, bunko man,
ex-saloon keeper and rounder. The
friends of Dunn are justly indignant at
his defeat. They admit with the frank
- ness of their breed that his appoint
ment would have been an outrage upon
the city, but they justly insist that
purih Us a paragon of respectability in
comparison with Dennery, and the
honorable physicians who could place
a Denn.ery in their nest would befoul it
no more by throwing in a Dunn.
But there is compensation In all
games and the disconsolate may find
some balm In the fact that the Board
of ' Health has appointed Long John
Wilkins messenger to the Quarantine
Officer. Long John has been a night
mare to a political generation. He has
haunted with his unwelcome presence
every political gathering for years, and
at last the Mexican has thrown him in
with 'the rest in the political refuse
created by the Board of Health.
' The members of the board demon
strate last night that Burns has a
nice discrimination In the distribution
of his favors. He has taken care of
Ed Niles, late of Los Angeles. Every
body knows Ed Xlles, the blajid, small
seeking attendant of power, living in
the sun of anybody's favor and grasp
ing with feeble grasp on the fringe of
that nondescript class known as men
of the world. Ed has at last got a Job.
He is now Afslstant Dislnterment In
spector, with full authority to dig up
dead Chinese and other things. It
se< ms like trifling with the dead, but
| the Mexican must rind berths for his
retainers.
And so the appointments went last
night down the line. The hospitals and
Almshouse were invaded to find places.
Inspectors, matron?, engineers, pate
keepers, watchmen, gardeners, deck
hands went the slippery road nut of of
fice. Nothing was too small to be over
; looked. But there may be a saving
Be to it all. The raid of the Mexi
can may not be so serious after all.
The Supervisors have pledged them
selves to a dollar limit in taxation.
That will mean that provision will be
made only for the statutory places In
the gift of the Hoard of Heaith. This
will mean an appropriation of (21,000
instead of $70,000. which was granted
last yea,r.

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 28, 1899.
THE PRESIDIO IS
A MONTE CARLO
THE Presidio is a veritable Monte Carlo. Despite the fact that there is
a regulation in the army prohibiting gambling, games of crap and
chuck-a-luck operated upon a large and princely scale are running
under the very nose of the commanding officer. It is not the fault of
Colonel Freeman, for he is about as powerless to put an end to the
evil as the lowest private upon the reservation. This is the case for the rea
son that the soldiers who are running the games have dozens of "lookouts"
on guard, who at the first sight of an officer pass the signal and the game
disappears as completely as If It had been swallowed up by the earth.
Yesterday there were two games of crap and one of chuck-a-luck running
In full blast just In the rear of the quarters of the Twenty-fourth Infantry
below the adjutant's office. There Is no limit to the games and a soldier may
wager an entire month's pay upon one turn of the bones If be so desires.
The men shoot for any amount from 10 cents up, and it can be safely esti
mated that several hundred dollars a day are made by the operators of the
banks. Of course on pay day the games are largely patronized, but a soldier
and his money are soon parted, and as a consequence few of them have a
cent the next day unless they have a run of marvelous luck.
CRUELTY TO A HORSE.
Question of Veracity Between a Po
liceman and Louis Anixter, the
Driver of a Milk Wagon.
Louis Anlxter, the driver of n milk
wagon for his uncle. Harris Anixter,
Devisadero street, appeared before judg*-
Graham yesterday on the charge of
cruelty tn animals. Policeman Rlley tes
tified that about 2 o'clock yesterday morn
ing he saw the defendant on Pierce street,
rear Waller, striking his horse on the
face with his fist, kicking it in the stom
ach and bringing it on the ribs with an
â  mpty milk can. The wheels of the wagon
had g^it stuck In a rut on the roadway.
The officer shied a rock at the horse him

He rliri not think much of the treatment
of the horse under the circumstances, but
about twenty minutes later he reached
Scott street and saw the defendant lie
laboring the horse with a board. Ttv-n
he considered be was acting cruelly, as
the wagon wheels were not in a rut. and
he placed him under arrest.
Anixter denied thai there was any truth
in the officer's story, and his uncle took

BY THE ARCHBISHOP
Rev, Patrick T. Collodu, Who Will Enter the Priest
hood To-Morrow Morning,
<y7TP X event of importance in Catholic circles will take place to-morrow
I \\ morning in St. Mary's Cathedral. Rev, P. T. Collopy, a young md
ll â^.\ brilliant candidate, is t" l> ordained to the hob' priesthood by his
[j \^Grace Archbishop Riordan with all the solemn ceremonies attendant
â¢hi sucli an occasion. Invitations have been issued to the large fol
lowing of friends of the young man. and there is every likelihood that tha
sacred edifice will be crowded. The services will be Inaugurated at 8 o'clock
in the morning and will be participated In by many priests of the diocose.
Mr. Collopy, who is to be ordained, Is .i native son. having been born In
tl is city twenty-eight years ago. He received bis education at Sacred
lU::rt College, and on graduating, finished his studies at St. Mary's Col
lege, Oakland. Having decided to follow the colling of a priest, he went on
to Baltimore and look a five years' course in the famous theological semi
nary of thai city. On the death ol 'iis father in I-Yhruarv last he returned
in tbis |3tate and finished the last three months of his studies at St. Pat

Baltimore, be stood at the head of his class. Many honors have been con
ferred on him for his able work, and his instructors predict a brilliant fu

gold medal for his talents In that important art. When St. Mary's College

Of the day. and his discourse was a feature of the celebration.
Ho will celebrate his first mnss on Sunday morning at 11 o'clock in St.

such a charge being made. He said he
i had examined the horse and had found no

The Judge was puzzled to know what

NO HARMONY
IN THE CAMP
OF DEMOCRATS
Heap of Trouble on
Phelan's Mind.
HIGH TREASON IS SUSPECTED
CLUBS EXISTING ONLY IN FANCY
INDORSE THE MAYOR.
Rainey Is Selected as the Outcast
to Suffer for the Sins
of All the Other
Bosses.
The camp of local Democrats 1b
crowded with politicians who are eager
to boss the party in the next municipal
campaign. The vast patronage under
the new charter Is the prize in view.
The high-handed usurpation of author
ity by the so-called Democratic County
Committee has provoked a spirit of
hostility in the ranks that threatens an
open revolt. To-day the moving fac
tions manifest so much bitterness that
party leaders predict disaster to the
Democrats in the next election.
There is a heap of political trouble on
Mayor Phelan's mind. One faction of
the party, that claims the exclusive
privilege of providing a pedestal for
the Mayor and conducting the exercises
of adoration, is assailed by A. M. Law
rence. The story goes that Lawrence
has broken with the Committee of One
Hundred because he cannot manage
the executive committee of twenty
which Jasper McDonald recently ap
pointed. The cause assigned for the
break is the report that the executive
committee has resolved to recognize
certain Assembly clubs as official or
ganizations. Mr. McDonald asserts
that no such recognition is promised,
but Lawrence is apprehensive of dan
ger to his scheme in this direction.
A supporter of the One Hundred re
marks: "For a lightweight in politics
Lawrence is playing a heavy game.
He has taken Into his confidence ex
boodlers and old-time outcasts. He
instructs them to get out and shout for
Phelan, to organize independent clubs
and adopt glowing resolutions of con
fidence in the Mayor's integrity as a
citizen and his speed as a political
runner. The game Is to convince the
Mayor that the people cannot be happy
without him. It is the hope that the
Mayor will be thus lulled to sleep by
the soft music of the praise service,
and that while he sleepeth Lawrence
may get ample time to do politics with
Rainey's men."
The leaders of the Committee of
One Hundred are certainly anxious to
convince the Mayor that they own the
works. They want him to understand
that the fountain of inspiration for the
next municipal campaign is in the
Columbian building. Accordingly they
have given Phelan some pointers to en
lighten him as to Lawrence's duplicity.
In the first place they have given to
Un> Mayor positive proof that one of
the great mass-meetings which in
dorsed him, and which was heralded
by Lawrence as a great outpouring of
independent Democrats, was attended
by only six persons. Proof was given
to the Mayor that many of the clubs
reported as having organized and
adopted Phelan resolutions do not exist
now and were never organized. The
resolutions were simply sent in for
publication 1 by rounders. The repre
sentatives of the Committee of One
undred also told Phelan that Law-
rence was ambitious to become a
"boss," and with the assistance of
Rainey's m<">n hoped to make the ticket
in all respects save that of Mayor.
The story comes that Phelan is get
tins very uneasy. He suspects that
Lawrence Is nut sincere. When it
comes to naming Supervisors it must
be confessed that Lawrence can hardly
l>ick nut a worse lot than Phelan once
selected. There are a great many Dem
ocrats, however, contending that the
convention should nominate the ticket
and that the bosses, hip and little,
should be compelled to stand aside.
It would be very embarrassing for
Lawrence at this time to point out any
dubs for official designation. His In
dependent organizations belong to the
realm of fancy, while the Buckley clubs
and the organization formed under the
auspices of the executive committee
are bands of visible and veritable roar
ing Democrats.
The Democratic municipal campaign,
so far as it relates to the renomina
tion of Mayor Phelan, is to be con
ducted under a pretense of rebuking
the bosses. Some particular boss is to
be selected as the "bogie man" of poli
tics. Rumor goes that Rainey, whose
abdication was heralded a few weeks
ago, is to take the role of had man.
He is to be execrated and driven to
his Ldvermore ranch. The programme
is still elastic and may be warped to
meet new conditions. The political
managers of the Southern Pacific bu
reau may introduce some original
features in the campaign. A boss
other than Rainey may be put up for
public execution. It is a sure thing,
however, that Phelan will be put for
ward as the arch enemy of the boss in
local politics.
PRIMARY OFFICERS.
Election Commissioners Act Upon
Three More Districts.
The Election Commissioners had a busy
day df ii yi sterday. They mcl tirst in the
morning and transacted routine business,
ami again ai night, when a large number
of voters were examined us to their ir-;-il
iflcations to serve us election officers for
tin- primary election on August S.
At the morning session Registrar Step
pacher reported that registration was in
creasing and promised to be satisfactory.
Bids for printing and stationery were
opened and the contract for printing was
awarded to the Commercial Publishing
Company for XlSft. Cunningham, Curtlss
& Welch received the contract for sta
tionery. their bid of $."iO being the luwst.
The board decided to erect election
booths except in precincts where ,1 â¢â ;â 
cant .store could be rented ai less tlvin
$17 TiO, the cost of erecting booth*:.
In the evening the board examined
several hundred voters, who had been
summoned in accordance with tho v>ro
visions of the new primary law. Men to
fill the vacancies in the precinct boards of
the Thirtieth District were firs; called.
and more than a sufficient number were
nnss"d temporarily. Then in turn the
Thirty-first. Thirty-third and Thirty
fourth districts were taken up. The plan
proved pntirely satisfactory, in many of
the precincts more than the number re
quired being: found who will be ablo to
serve. These names will be considered
to-day and the selections made. The
Thirty-fifth District was not acted upon,
the board excusing the persons summoned
until Thursday night, to which time the
board adjourned. Besides the Thirty

CRATIC CAMPAIGN.
Meeting of the Executive Committee
in the New Headquarters in the
Columbia Building.
Thf executive committee of the Demo
cratic Committee of One Hundred mrt in
Its now quarters in the Columbia build-
Ing last evening. As yet the room* are
! not prepossessing, but they will be bet-
I tered later, and to that end it has been
! decided to let out a. little of the patronage.
There will be an assistant secretary ap
pointed, whose business it will be to sit
in the rooms of the committee and extend
a glad hand and winsome smile to any
of the faithful who may wish to spend
the day in one of the chairs.
The distribution of this bit of patronage
was considered sufficiently momentous
by the executive committee to warrant
the nppointment of a special committee of
three to see that the right man gets it.
So far the only man spoken >>f is that vet
eran place-holder J. H. Zemansky, who
has just emerged from the Registrar' 5 ; of
fice under the turn of affairs political.
The committee on assistant secretary is
composed of Howard Park. George Mc-
I Gilivray and Barna McKenna. The com
mittee "promises to furnish a suitable as
sistant secretary within ;i few days, and
one who will put in all his spare time in
the headquarters.
Most of the time of the committee was
spent in listening to Mr. McCarthy, who
had a few words to say on nearly every
thing brought up. He was responsible
for the idea that something ought to be
done to bring out a big vote on August
S. and he moved that a committee of three
be appointed to prepare an address to the
voters upon the subject. The committee
will be appointed later, 'he chair decid
ing that it would take some time to pick
out the literary geniuses of the organiza
tion.
M H. Hernan of the committee on
registration stirred up a parliamentary
tangle that t"ok tho remaining part of
the session to unravel. It was whether or
not the registration committee could be
charged with the task of supervising the
roll of Democrats who had hern nr would
be appointed to serve as election officers.
It was finally decided that the matter
should be left tn the registration com
mittee, as was suggested in the first
place. The Registrar will be notified that:
tiic members of that committee will offi
cially represent the Democratic party in
tlu> matter of election officers. The mem
bers of the committee are M. H. Hernan,
J. li. Grady. Barna McKenna. P. li Mc-
Carthy and YV. D. Farren. They will call
on the Registrar to-day.
Maxwell, for the finance committee, re
: ported progress and then went on to tell
i what good work the committee had done.
! It seems it will not be necessary to assess
! any of the followers of the Democratic
| prophet if the Committee of One Hun
dred will only come to the front. That it
I will has been promised by several who.
! however, did not at the timp speak for the
: whole committee. This Mr. Maxwell was
j careful to explain, though at the same
' time ho threw out a hope of financial im
munity that was refreshing and reassur
: Inir.
The committee on hall pointed with
! pride to the uncarpeted rocms and an
nounced that the janitor of the building
would keep them clean without extra ex
' pense. One man of discernment. Mr. Far
ren. observed that there were no acoom
! modations for the press, and the hall
i committee was ordered to add the re
i <)tiired furnishing. Maxwell was the first
I to get tired, and he moved to adjourn, a
motion that met with favor, and the com
i mltteemen departed.
There was a short meeting of the regis
tration committee after the executive
committee had adjourned, the result of
! which was that the "press is requested to
j call attention to the fact that unless a
i man registers his removal from his pre
viously registered address by July 8 he
i will forfeit the privilege of voting, for
! July S is the limit of time for the record-
I ing of changes of residence."
