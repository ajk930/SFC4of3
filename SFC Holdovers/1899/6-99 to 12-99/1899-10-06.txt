SECOND CUP RACE RESULTS IN FAILURE,
But Wireless Telegraphy Scores a Triumph
Question of Supremacy of the
Challenger and Defender
Remains Undetermined,
Owing to the Scarcity of
Wind.
NEW YORK, Oct. 5. -Given a little more timeâ a day or twoâ and with
such -weather as was about to-day, the Columbia ami Shamrock ma; yet
make a race of it, may at least get around the outer mark, which to-day
Fanned by a breeze, a listless, waning zephyr, the yachts stood across the
line with the wink of the starting gun, and then leisurely sauntering into a
zone of calm, whir for four hours and more â until a signal was made and the
race was offâ the challenger and defender lay in a trance with naught to . do
but watch their own shadows in the tide rolling dreamily under foot. And
when at least the welcome signal came announcing that the race was off. there
still stretched a good three milt-s of further drift between the yachts and the
outer mark.
Of the two conclusions reached by those who followed this marine saunter-
Ing of the rival yachts, one is that when it comes to a plain case of drifting as
was the case to-day, the Shamrock can drift as fast if not faster than the
Columbia. The other expert opinion is that the weather ought to be ashamed
of v-
The pity of It, save for lack of wind, the day was perfect and warm, the
skies high and blue and the sea all that could be asked. Brought by an excur
sion fleet that seemed to have no end. a concourse of excursionists was there to
look a: this second fiasco of a yacht race. These looked upon It from magnifi
cent distances, the torpedo boats and revenue cutters keeping all craft well
away from the yachts and well clear of the course over which they were trying
Sir Thomas Lipton's steam yacht, the Erin, a guard boat by courtesy, was
carried too near the course, and heedless of tooting whistles from the watchful
revenue cutters; continued to drift athwart the path of the contesting yachts. Two
of the cutters opened their whistles in a long, loud, lingering warning, one
that seemed to have something of an apology in it. for it was clear to all on
lookers that the Erin was not a willful sinner, but had been carried out of
line through inadvertence of some une temporarily, perhaps, in charge. No
one realized that the noisy tooting was meant for the Erin until a gun boomed
from the cutter Onondaga. The smoke of the blank cartridge had hardly
cleared away before the Erin pick up her heels and scurried back to the line
of gunboats, . seemingly full of apology for the error of which she had been
There was promise of a fresh wind when the yachts stood out for the starting
lireâ a promise held out by the Weather Bureau, and which the weather condi
tions did not ser-m likely to fulfill
.Over the lower bay lay a bank of mist, a silvery, gauzy vapor, that rendered
indistinct objects half a mile away. The vapor thinned as the hours wore on. but
with the lifting of the curtain there was still no hint of the promised breeze, no
suggestion that it was traveling on schedule time.
Singly ar.d by pairs, squadrons and divisions the excursion fleet came up and
gathered near the starting line. The two racers were there circling abo . the
jade.i lightship, a vessel ablaze with the memory of many such yachting scenes.
Under staysail; club topsail and mainsail, the yachts went gliding over the blue
â¢water, their amber-tinted sails barely swelling to the languid breeze, the canvas
looking as squalid as if it had been cut from out of that morning bank of mist or
sliced ironi ilie silver wind. The wind, what little there was of it. came from the
northwest, and the course was laid southeast by east, a fifteen-mile run to lee
ward and a beat back to the linish, if, perchance, there should be wind enough
to waft the yachts over that route.
A gun boomed from the yacht Corsairâ the preparatory signalâ and the yachts

for* staysail showing in addition to her .nher canvas, took in that sail soon after
crossing, and stood down the wind, showing the same sail the Shamrock was
wearing, ior a space of live minutes or so the two yachts kept well together
ne;ther losing, neither gaining. Then tne Columbia began to draw slowly he id'
so slowly as to be hardly perceptible, but gradually she drew away little by little'
bit by b:t. until at last daylight showed between the two. The tired wind droned
and died In flukes and patches. But it was more impartial than the wind of
iuesuay. and favored one yacht no more than it did the other
Realizing that the indolent air was a true Columbia breeze, the narrow-waist
ea lierreshoff boat did her best to improve her opportunity and to leave her
broad-beamed opponent far behind. But the Shamrock was not to be so easily
shaken off. and. persistent as the Columbia's own shadow, the Irish yacht hung
on the flank of the American boat. The wind hauled a few points and, taking in
the spinnaker, the yachts stood away on the broad reach, the Shamrock luffing
ciose up. evidently trying to blanket the Columbia by running under that vessel's
lee. To prevent that the Columbia luffed also and then came a series of jockey-
Ing, in which neither boat seemed to gain any advantage. But the two loitering
along the course, came to a zone where the weakling wind died Into a breathless
calm. The rest was drifting, an aimless, steerage, wayless pointing in one direc
tion and then another. The sea pull drew the yachts together, and for a time It
looked as though they would rub sides.
Finally there came idling by a lazy, listless breeze, a veritable Weary Willie

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 6, 18953.
The Wizard of Wireless Telegraphy.
MESSAGE FLASHED
TO MAYOR PHELAN
HIS HONOR'S REPLY WILL BE SENT TO MARCONI
The compliments of Signor Marconi and the New York Herald, vibrated wirelessly from
the ocean off the Jersey coast, were presented yesterday afternoon to Mayor Phelan a few min
utes after 1:30 o'clock, San Francisco time. Such a messagi was totally unexpected by the
Mayor.
"What?" he asked. "You don't moan to say that this came by wireless telegraphy?"
He was assured that the message had been started by nn less a hand than that of Signor
Marconi himself, who was even then on the steamer Ponce returning with the challenger, and
defender.
"Well, that beats me." he exclaimed. "How was it done?"
It was explained to his Honor that the message, like the bulletins of the race sent The
Call, had been sent out on Hertzian waves, produced by the Marconi apparatus. These trav
eled at speed until thty met the apparatus on the Xavesink Highlands attuned to the same key.
As the word waves vibrated against this apparatus it was set vibrating in key, starting in mo
tion a registering telegraph, the record rolling off on paper tape, from which it was sent San
Franciscoward instanter by the Western Union Telegraph Company.
"It's marvelous," said the Mayor; "nothing short of marvelous. I can hardly believe it
yet, although here is the evidence in my hands."
And the Mayor read the message again. He wanted to know how he should acknowledge
the compliment.
Mnyor Pheian
"Will The Call send a message for me?" he asked. He was assured it would, and he sat down at once to
write a reply, when he was stopped by the suggestion that it would be better to send the message Saturday dur
ing the progress of the yacht race, when there was a certainty that Sigrnor Marconi would be at sea on the Ponce.
The Mayor fell in with this idea at once and promised to prepare a message Saturday morning for transmission to
the Italian scientist to testify his wonder at the perfection of wireless telegraphy. The Call will send the Mayor's
message, and out on the bosom of the Atlantic Ocean, in the heat of the next struggle for the America's cup, it
will be carried to those on board the steamer Ponce.

The first ten minutes after the start
were anxious ones for those directly In
terested In the Shamrock ;md the Colum
bia. In two minutes the Columbia's bow
sprit began to creep past the Shamrock's
bow, and in ten minutes the Columbia
was clear out ahead of the Shamrock.
Both took In their staysails and jib, so as
to give the immense balloon sails plenty
of draught.
So light was the wind at this time that
only the balloon sriils seemed to be doing
service for either yacht. The main sheets
hunt slack in between the bows and the
booms and the great mainsails hung flat
.nis from over the starboard side of
each yacht.
Mile after mile the yachts traveled slow
ly to the southeast, the Columbia gaining
slowly but steadily all the time. At 5
minutes to 12 the wind freshened a bit,
canttng at the same time a couple of
points to the eastward. Captain Hogarth
saw it first and his crew took in the spin
naker smartly, the Columbia's men follow
ing suit a minute later and setting their
forestay sail at the same time.
Fearing that the Shamrock would try to
luff out and pass him to windward, Cap
-1 tain Barr began to luff the Columbia.
j Both kept it dp for fully ten minutes,
: until they were both heading east. Cap-
I tain Hogarth kept the Shamrock's spln
â  r.aker mast headed, with a couple of men
I holding it half way down the mast, ready
; to be shot out at a moment's notice, until
I 12:02 o'clock, when he let it ru: down.
Finally, at 12:06 o'clock, the Columbia,
still being 50*) yards ahead, kept broad off
! for her course again, the Shamrock Im
mediately following suit. The wind hela
in the same quarter until 12:40 o'clock, the
Columbia meanwhile Raining on her rival.
; At that time the wind backed around to
i the northwest and the Columbia jibed,
; the Shamrock following her two minutes
later.
At 1:18 the Columbia's crew sent her
â  spinnaker out to starboard, and two mmâ 
â  utes later the Shamrock's was set. Far ,
! away in the blue haze the outer mark was
, sighted at 1:16.
With th<? weather prevailing at that timo
I there was little chance of finishing the
i race within the prescribed limit of live j
and a half hours. During the next half
hour the wind dropped out almost en
tirely.
At 1:30 the spinnakers came in on both
yachts, and they were jibed to starboard.
At 2:10 the Columbia set her spinnaker to
port, taking it in again five minutes later.
Both jibed to port at 2:20, and a few min
utes later a light breeze came in from the
southward. Sheets were trimmed down
and both yachts were soon close hauled
on the starboard tack. The Shamrock set
her baby jib topsail at once, but the Co
lumbia was held some five minutes before
being set.
At 2:38:30 the Shamrock went about to
port, the Columbia following suit twenty
seconds later. The Shamrock then ap
peared to have a slight advantage. The
wind was very light, and the Shamrock in
this smooth water seemed to be doing
very well, her larger sail plan proving a
little too much for the Columbia. When
the later went about to starboard at 3

The Can ueFt flti Rivals
Behind J!"i sivths the
News and secured the
"Scoop" oF the Century
IN addition to the wonderful triumph of wireless telegraphy in reporting the
international yacht races, the world applauds the slap in the face the new
discovery ha? administered to yellow journalism. In this city the mask of
fake and false pretense has been torn from the jaundiced front of the Ex
aminer, the leader on this coast In the ranks of the saffron hued; and, painful
as was the task, the grandmotherly visage of the ancient Chronicle was also
exposed, blstanced by the enterprise of The Call, which first harnessed ;ne new
electrical current to the car of journalistic progress, the very elderly but very
religious Chronicle contented itself with an unavailing effort to convey intelli
gence of the great international yacht race through the agency of Associated
Pr< ss bulletins. It failed ignominiously, but it saved its honor.
The Examiner, equally up a stump, was true to Its policy of fake. fake, al
ways fake. True to its history of fake, it also blundered, this time, however,
beyond all recovery. It was caught red-handed, but instead of sneaking off and
lying quiet until its faking was forgotten, it attempted to brazen it out. At
11:80 o'clock, San Francisco time, it put out its first bulletin on the yacht race.
It read: "Columbia leads; wind twelve miles an hour." For more than an hour
The Call had been continuously posting bulletins on the event that was engag
ing the attention of two worlds. For the next fifty minutes the Examiner did not
post another bulletin. The Call, thanks to wireless telegraphy, still sending
them forth. The Examiner was getting sore, and, yellow journal that it is,
turned positively green with envy. In absolute jealousy at the coup of The
Call, it decided to take a petty revenge on Marconi. 3i"Xi miles away. It was so
blinded with rage at the fact that he was in the service of a rival that it was
blinded to the great scientific value of his achievement. Instead of hailing him
as the greatest discovery of the century, it resolved to scoff, as the world once did
at Galileo and Columbus. In lieu of any other bulletin, it had the extremely bad
taste to post the following:
BY WiRELESS-Macaroni.
12:20 p. m.--The Race Is On.
What a magnificent revenge! Poor Marconi! Great Examiner! Great
heavens!
Fifteen minutes later, having unloaded this gob of bile, the Examiner gave
forth another bulletin. It said the Columbia was seven-eighths of a mile in the
lead. The fake staff had evidently returned from a hasty lunch and was a little
off on distances. Marconi's bulletin of even time said the Columbia was only an
eighth of a mile ahead. Of course, three-quarters of a mile difference made no
difference, according to Examiner calculations, and so that there might be no
kick coming to the adherents of either racer it immediately posted another
bulletin that the "Shamrock is apparently in the lead. "
At the Examiner office, it appears, "you pays your money and you takes your
choice. Which'll you have?"
"While The Call was putting out bulletins right along the" Examiner contented
Itself with just three more until 2:25 p. m.. New York time, when it posted:
"Boats are on home run. Columbia one mile ahead." At 2:45 p. m. it said the
yachts had covered twenty miles and .he Columbia had a good lead. The faker
In chief, not content with this fast sailing, went himself one better. Five min
utes later, or, to be exact, at 2:45 p. m., NeW York time, he posted a bulletin read
ing: 'â¢Shamrock rapidly overhauling the Columbiaâ a few lengths apart."
Half a mile gain In five minutes. Whew, how the wind must have been blow
ing through the faker's whiskers! Or. maybe, he was onl^- trying to make his
log jibe with the erratic wanderings of the mimic boats on the outer wall.
Half a dozen other alleged bulletins equally dopy and contradictory were
posted,, -probably to keep up appearances. â¢ â  !Â£***>
At 3:12. New York time. The Call posted a bulletin that, with the Shamrock
pointing higher, the stakeboat was still two miles away. One minute later the
Examiner posted a bulletin, time New York. 3:15 p. m., which read: "The two
racers are about six miles from finish. Shamrock seems to have gained a little."
That bulletin could mean nothing else than that the boats were on the home
ward reach, racing for all they were worth. The management of The Call wired
Marconi: "Examiner bulletin to the effect that yachts have turned stakeboat and
are on the finish." In the briefest possible period the answer came back:
Examiner bulletin fake. Yachts have not turned the stakeboat.
MARCONI.
At 3:17 P- m.. New York timf. the Examir.fr posted a bulletin saying, "Very
exciting finish probably." At 3:45 p. m.. New York time, the yachts swung around
and headed for home, before they reached the outside mark, and The Call pub
lished a bulletin to that effect, with the statement that the race was declared
off At 3:49 P- ni.. while the Examiner, apparently bewildered, was trying to discern
tbe boats through the haze. The Call posted the bulletin announcing "No race."
And there wasn't. The Examiner was no nearer to the truth in any of its
fake bulletins than were either of the yachts to the finish when the last bulletin
was posted. The Call had distanced it as it has done many times before. The
j, ,',',,. Â;,; Chronicle threw up its withered hands early in the game, and with the
ted Press, once the greatest news-gathering agency on earth, took off its
hat to The Call and Marconi.
For the benefit of such as wish to make the comparisons The Call submits
below a number of the bulletins on the races received by this paper, and all of

CALL'S TRIUMPHS
BY WIRELESS
TELEGRAPHY
Wireless telegraphy is no longer an ex
periment in modern journalism. It la an
. triumph. Ti.is triumph was
â  â  â¢ me through the

this paper, in all modest} a::U in absolute
aw. a r of the achievement,
lays : to credit other than that
which ably coupled with It a

. a.
The arrival of the transport Sherman
from Manila in the lattei part of August
gave The Call its opportunity to demon
strate the adaptability of Marconi's dis
covery to newagatherlng forces. It was
the first to herald through that agency
the early arrival of California's heroes
from the Philippines. So taken up were
the people of ban Francisco With joy at
the return of their sons that the marvel
of thin scientilic achievement was lost
eight of in this city. Not so in other
parts of the world. Into thousands of
newspaper olTiees on this continent, in
Great Britain and EtfTope was Hashed the
story of The- Call's journalistic coup. Edi
tors, calloused to ordinary notions by
reason of frequent surprises, ere
' astounded and had to admit that there
was at least one thine new under the
eun and that it was wireless telegraphy
adapted to the needs of the up-to-date
newspapers. A journal away uu on the
western edge of the continent had taught
them the lesson; and even tnose who were
loth to do so admitted that The Call had
recorded the greatest scoop of the ceu
lury.
In spite of the proof that the Marconi
system had been securely harnessed to
the car of modern journalism there were
some, to doubt and others to scoff. They
needed another lesson and The Call pro
ceeded to give it to them. The grand op
portunity presented Itself in the interna
tional yacht races between the cup chal
lenger Shamrock and the defender Colum
bia. In conjunction with the New York
Herald, the first paper at the East to ap
preciate the value 01 The Call's feat, this
paper Invited Signor Marconi to superin
tend the working of his system in report*
ing the progress of the marine racers. The
great Italian aeeeptt-d. He sailed for
New York with a corps of capable assist

vessels provided by The Call and Herald
to accompany the fleet-winged yachts.
Last Tuesday, with every condition as
.favorable as could lie for the stereotyped
â¢system in use by . Lthering agencies,
f thi- Marconi wireless telegraph was easily
lirst, the ancient method nowhere. The
Call, in this city, and the Herald, in New
York, were enabled to post the news of
every movement in the race two minutes
â¢ after it had happened. Other New York
and San Francisco newspapers had no
bulletins to post and, as is the custom
of the yellowest, faked but did not fool
the public. In this city the attempt of
'the Examiner and Chronicle to keep up
with the procession led by The Call was
.'pitiable and unavailing:. The Examiner,
true to its policy that desperate cases
call for dc-sperate remedies, was shame
less in Its attempts to deceive the peo
.ple into the belief that it was receiving
bulletins of the race. It had little op
:portunity, it having become early evi
dent to the gathering crowds that The
'Call's bulletins were more reliable, fuller
â¢and more realistic than me -belated and
faked. In consequence, only the few that
â¢could not get near enough to read The
.Call bulletins wasted any of their time
on the Examiner or Chronicle delayed
offering's.
It was another signal triumph for
.The Call and wireless telegraphy, but it
was absolutely overshadowed by that of
rday. It would be worse than use
less to attempt to describe the hundreds
and hundreds that gathc-red in front of
the business office of this paper, long be
fore the hour set for the start, or t.. try
to picture the growth of the crowd, its
'surging* and lta excitement as the bulle
tins were posted and the race was pic
tured on tne painted canvas over the
arch. Market street is wide, but that it
was not blocked Is entirely due to the
.heroic efforts of the squad* of patrolmen
led by Captain Splllane. They were
adepts nr handling a crowd and kept tho
â¢ way clear for pedestrians and vehicles
without so much as an angry word

that It would again be a case of no race,
they resigned themselves to the inevitable

at Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 6.â At to-nlghfe
session of the State Convention of the
Women's Christian Temperance Union
there was a debate on the question: "Re
solved, That territorial expansion by force
of arms is contrary to the principles of
righteous government."
The speakers for the affirmative pre
sented the argument that in acquiring the
Philippines the United States was merely
following out its natural purpose of
growth and development and that Chris
tianity would be the gainer by the con
quest. It remained for Miss Sarah Sever
ance, however, to explode these argu
ments. When she had finished a vote was
taken and while scores stood up In answer
to the call for a vote on the negative
there was not a single delegate to arise
in defense of the war in the Philippines.

ANOTHER INJUSTICE IN
FREIGHT RATE TARIFF
SOUTHERN PACIFIC INCREASES
THE TAX ON WINE,
The Price Raised From Sixty, to Sev
enty-five Cents per Hundred
Pounds on Shipments
in Wood.
The increased Southern Pacific freight
rates on twenty-two articles, published in
The Call a few days ago, went Into ef
fect to-day, and there is another and
important article which is marked out for
Increased taxation on the loth of this
month.
â Shippers of wine, one of the principal |
â products of this State, are to be forced to
li-ay an extra tribute In order to get their
â ^."nis in Eastern markets. Formerly the
Irate on wine in wood was fiO cents pi r I X)
â pounds, ;i rate which was considered high,
Ibut now tliat ligure has been Increased
It" 7," cents, and on this charge there is a
I.' per cent addition for all wine shipped
lin puncheons. This 20 per cent Increase
Pon the puncheons Is claimed as a differ
ential which has always linen charged by
the company, and the raise Is said to be
merely based on the larger volume of
wine shipped in wood in order that the
differential shall not be lost.
The merchants say this is a subterfuge;
that the Southern Pacific never before
charged any. such differential; that form
erly wine in word and wine in puncheons
went at the same figure, and that there
lore the 20 per cent is an increase that is
unwarranted by any precedent
However this may be, the raise has gone
Into effect, and the men doing business in
this State with Chicago and all other
Eastern distributing points must stand it,
whether they like it or not.
At 9:3fl yesterday morning the track in
the vicinity of Cisco was cleared of the

Details of the matter are lacking, and
there are few people at this point who

ST. FRANCIS BEGINS
ITS DAY OF JUBILEE
FATHER FILBERT DELIVERS A
STIRRING SERMON.
Fiftieth Birthday of the Church to
Be Celebrated During the Rest
of the Week.
Father Fllbort, one of the most ad
vanced prelates of the church in this
city, Wednesday opened the week of
Jubilee which is to celebrate the fiftieth
anniversary of St. Francis Church with
one of the most eloquent sermons ever
delivered from a pulpit in this city.
Although his theme, the life of the
patron saint of the church, was inspiring
enough in itself, the steadfast attention
of the crowd that filled the handsome edi
fice at Vallejo street and Montgomery
avenue was even mure so, and for the
half hour he spoke there was not a mo
ment In which hlx words lacked lnti rest.
The decorations were rich and beautiful.
The chancel and altar were banked with
ferns and white flowers, and the gallery
and choir loft were draped with yellow
and white hangings.
The programme rendered by the choir
was one of exceptional merit, and some of
the most prominent artists of the city
participated. Among them were Pro
fessors H. J. Stewart, Harrison. Arillaga,
anu H. S. Stedman, Messrs, Van Brunt,
Benyl, Mrs. Eva Tenru-, Ml.ss Maud Fay,
Miss Ella McCloSky, Miss Katherine
Black, Miss A. Devlin, Miss C. Devlin and
Mrs. C. Parent.

WESTWARD JOURNEY
OF THE PRESIDENT
At Every Station the Party Is Greeted
With Large Crowds of Enthu
siastic People.
LAFAYETTE, Ind.. Oct. B.â As the
Presidential train went westward through
the State of Ohio and into Indiana the
crowds at the stations grew very large.
At every station the crowd clamored
loudly for a speech, but the President
skillfully evaded these requests by bring
ing forward and introducing successively
the members of the Cabinet, each of,
whom was invariably greeted with much
applause. The President shook hands
with as many as could reach him at sev
eral stations. So the first day of the trip
has been passed, contrary to expectations,
without an address or speech of any kind.
The crowds were Invariably enthuslastio
and hearty in their greeting. At almost
all of the stops bands were stationed to
play "Hail to the Chief" as the train
pulled in. Illinois will be crossed during
the night, and at 8 o'clock to-morrow
morning the party will arrive in Qutncy,
where the President will speak at the
Soldiers' Home.

MARCONI DUPLICATES
HIS SUCCESSFUL WORK
OF LAST TUESDAY
NEW YORK, Oct. o.â Owing to
weather conditions New York wa i
entirely dependent upon Signor
Marconi and his wireless Bystem
of telegraphy for authentic news
of to-day's race between the Co
lombia and Shamrock for the America's
cup. Signor Marconi in reporting the
event for The Call and Herald not only
did not disappoint the public, but he fur
nished every detail of the race quite as
promptly as during the first contest on
Tuesday, when the yachts kept well
toward shore. Over most of the course
followed by the yachts to-day a heavy
fog prevailed, and this made it impos
sible for observers in signal stations
along the New Jersey and Long Island
shores to distinguish the two yachts for
nmro than an hour after 12 o'clock. The
other reports indicated that the Sham
rock way In the lead, but Signor Mar
coni, in his special messages, not only told
that the Columbia had the lead, but fur
nished many details of the maneuvers
aboard the contesting yacht?.
Two feats were accomplished by Signor
Marconi which attracted the especial at
tention of the crowds that gathered in
front of the Herald building to get the
latest news of the race. The first was the
receipt in the Herald's office of a dis
patch at twenty-three minutes past 12
1c in which Signor Marconi told that
the yachts were going between five ami
six knots an hour; that the Columbia
was an eighth of a mile In the lead and
that the course was remarkably clear.
When that dispatch was received all New
Fork was In doubt about the race. The
other newsgathering agencies had been
qualifying their dispatches for an hour,
admitting that the hazy weather condi
tions made it impossible to obtain accu
rate information about the yachts by the
usual methods.
In several subsequent dispatches Signor
Marconi reported that the Columbia was
still in the lead, although the only other
reports insisted that the Shamrock was
leading.
The accuracy of the wireless telegraph
reports were proved at 1:26 o'clock, when
a dispatch was received from the sain.'
authority which had reported the Sham
rock as the leader. This dispatch, I
upon news brought by a dispatch boat
which left the scene of the race at 12:20
o'clock, completely verified Signor Mar
coni's message which announced that the
Columbia at that time was leading by an
eighth of. a mile. Signor Marconi thus
beat the next best system for reporting
races by one hour and 2 minutes.
The next most notable feature, and cer
tainly the most remarkable and Impor
tant, was Signor Marconi's reply to a
message from the Herald asking if a ru
mor that the Grand Republic, an excur
sion steamship, had been sunk, was true.
This rumor, which gained circulation
early in the afternoon, caused great anx
iety among relatives and friends of those
aboard the Grand Republic. The vessel,
which is a large one, carried hundreds of
persons out to witness the races, and it
was impossible for more than an hour to
learn positively whether the report of .a
terrible catastrophe was true or false. A
message was sent from the Herald to the
steamship Ponce, from which Signor Mar
coni was operating the wireless system,
asking if the Grand Republic actually had
gone down. In an incredibly short time
the fears of all were swt at. rest by the. re
ceipt of an answer from Signor Marconi.
This read: "Grand Republic all right.
Following General Slocum in."
While the entire country was In doubt
as to whether the Columbia or Shamrock
was leading, later in the afternoon, Signor
Marconi gave another demonstration of
the value of the wireless telegraph sys
tem. It was reported by various after
noon newspapi rs that the racing yachts
had rounded the stakeboat soon after 2
o'clock, and the public was kept in doubt
as to whether the boats were on the first
or second leg of the course. Signor Mar
coni's dispatches indicated that the stak&
boat had not been rounded, and there
was much speculation as to who was
right. This, like every' other important
point of the day's contest, was later in
the day settled by the wireless telegraph.
Signor Marconi's reports were the only
on>? giving any accurate news of the sit
uation during the last hour of the contest.
He sent at 3:or> o'clock news that the
Shamrock had drawn up alongside the
Columbia and had passed her. Five mm
Utes later he sent another dispatch tell
ing that the Shamrock still retained her
position. By another agency it was an- j
nounced at 3:15 o'clock that while it was
11 f

i impossible to see the yachts distinctly the
Columbia seemed to be half a mile in tho
lead. At the same instant Signor Marconi
made it known that the Shamrock was
two lengths ahead. When the race was
declared oft Signor Marconi at 3:4s o'clock
sent a dispatch announcing that at the
time of the linish the Shamrock was In
the lead and had the better position.
Those who were relying on other news
agencies were assuming that the Colum
bia, Instead of the Shamrock, was lead
ing at the Qniah. Representatives of other
newspapers continue to show their appre
ciation of the value of the wireless tele
graph system. As fast a3 Signor Mar
coni dispatches were posted on the bul
letin board in front of the Herald build
ing these men would copy the messages
and hurry away to Inform their news
paper offices, One amusing illustration of
the result came to lig^t. Several other
metropolitan newspapers have branch of
fices in the vicinity of Herald Square, and
on a board In front or one. 01 these
branches a bulletin was posted at twenty
seven minutes alter 12 o'clock announcing
that owing to the fog neither of the racing
yachts could be seen. While this bulletin
was being posted the latest dispatch from
bignor Marconi, announcing that the Co
lumbia was an eighth of a mile ahead,
was being posted in front of the Herald
building. Three minutes aner the rival
newspaper had reported that nothing
could be seen of the yachts it posted an
other bulletin announcing that the Co
lumbia was an eighth of a mile ahead.
Those in the crowd who observed the
quick transformation made merry over it.
Fifteen hundred passengers on the
j steamer Grande Duchesse left the Plant
Line pier at Canal street to-day at half
past '.Â» o'clock, jubilant with the certainty
they felt that they were to see a mag
nificent race. W. J. Clarke's apparatus
for sending wireless telegrams by tho
Marconi system attracted great attention
on the Grande Duchesse. Passengers
] gathered about the wheelhouse and
watched the sending of bulletins.
Messages were sent to the Highlands
and to the Mackay-Bennett cable ship,
covering the movements of the yachts,
when Signor Marconi was not using the
aerial telegraph from the Ponce. Bul
letins sent by Marconi were received and
pieces of the tape on which they were
; printed automatically were carried away
by tho passengers as souvenirs.
The following message written by Cap- -
tain George 1.. Norton was sent: "Fifteen
I hundred loyal citizens of New York desire
to congratulate the Herald on the success
of the Marconi system of wireless teleg
j raphy on board the Grande Duchesse."
In double-column measure the Evening
; Journal continued (in red type) its dis
| crepancies as follows:
"At 2:15 the yachts were made out about
i twelve miles to the southward. Through
I the haze they appeared to have turned the
Btakeboat and were splitting tacks, the
Columbia having a lead of over a mile.
"2:20 p. in.â Columbia's lead has been
: reduced by Shamrock. The wind is fresh
| ening where the yachts are. They may
finish within the time limit.
"Two-thirds of the course was covered
! at 2:22 and the Columbia then led by less
j than 300 yards. Both were on port tack,
with a fair breeze filling their sails.
"3 p. m.â The boats are now in port tack
i headed toward the Jersey coast on the
way home."
No doubt the Evening Journal did its
I best, but that was not much compared
; with Its more enterprising contemporary,
i the Evening Telegram. The latter, fully
i informed to the moment by Signor Mar
j coni's system, instead of announcing that
1 two-thirds of the distance had been coy-
I ered at 20 minutes past 2 o'clock, told its
I readers that the first stakeboat was still
1 miles away.
The Associated Press bulletined to the
i entire country that the yachts turned the
i first stakeboat at 2:25, whereas when the
i race was finally called off the Shamrock
i leading, was still about three miles from
I the turn. .
I Away out In San Francisco the reliabil-
i ty of the Marconi system was quickly
i realized. Two of the papers, the Chroni
-1 cle and the Examiner, failed to give due
! credit to the work of Signor Marconi. The
Call used greater wisdom, hence the fol
i lowing dispatch from its editor to the
! Herald:
"Accept congratulations on to-day's
j success. Chronicle and Examiner report
ed yachts turned Btakeboat at 2:25. Later
on had them six miles from home, running
very fast. EDITOR CALL,"
On board the Ponce all was enthusiasm
i In spite of the dismal failure of the at
j tempt to raise sufficient wind to make a
I race. The haze, which shut out the Jer
i sey shore, made it certain that a fair test
â  would be given to the Marconi system of
wireless telegraphy, and that was what
was wanted. From the Ponce the bul
! letins were sent to an expert operator, who
: telegraphed them over a direct wire lead
! ing into the Herald office. Thus the ser
-1 vice was made practically Instantaneous.
; Every individual on the Ponce took a
i personal interst in the work of reporting
I the race, and the crowd about the chart
j room from which the telegraphing was
done never dwindled.EX-SENATOR HARLAN

BATTLE FLAG RESTORED
TO TEXAS RANGERS
Interesting Relic Once More in the
Hands of the Famous Confeder
ate Organization.
DALLAS, Tex., Oct s.â The tattered
battletiag of Terry's Texas Rangers was
to-day restored to the remnant of the gal
lant Confederate band, the ceremonies
taking place at the auditorium at the fair
grounds.
Governor Mount of Indiana, in an im
pressive speech before a iarge assemblage,
presented the flag to Governor Bayers,
who in turn presented it to Hon. James
Miller, president of the Association of
Terry's Rangers. <;r~;tt enthusiasm was
manifested during the proceedings.
The flag is an Interesting relic. The
Rangers claim that it was never 'captured,
but that it was lost while they were in
retreat. The Indianans, however, assert
â  it fell into their regiment's hands
during the heat of battle. Terry's Rangers
formed one of the most famous regiments
of the war.

GORMAN CHARGED WITH
BREACH OF CONTRACT
Secretary of the Tlhualito Cotton
Company Arrestsd at
Torreon.
AUSTIN. Oct. 5.â A dispatch from Tor
reon, Mexico, says that a stir has been
created in commercial circles of M< x
ico by the arrest of Juan O. Gorman, sec
retary of the Tlhualito Cotton Company.
Mr. Gorman was immediately released on
$5000 bonds. His arrest grows out of the
suit recently instituted by Eugene Signor
et, a wealthy French merchant, against
the Tlhualito Cotton Company for $200,
--000.
It is alleged in the suit that Juan Lla
medo. manager of the Tlhualito company,
contracted with Mr. Signoret to sell him
the whole of this year's cotton crop pro
duced on the company's extensive hacien
da near Torreon for $200,000, and that this
contract has n^t been kept. The Tlhualito
company attained considerable notoriety
in the Vnited States a few years ago by
importing several hundred negroes from
Alabama and Georgia to work on their
hacienda. Smallpox broke out among the
negroes soon after thfir arrival in Mex
ico, and nearly all of them died of the
disease.

The jingo press pooh-poohs the idea of
European interference, but in tho same
breath eagerly seizes upon any Incident,
such as the America's cup races, to insist
on the growing Anglo-American friend
ship.
A dispatch from Cape Town says that a
quantity of explosives was found inside
the Cape Town "postofflce yesterday and
that an attempt had been made to murder
the start at the Colesburg Railway junc
tion.
The Daily Telegraph's dispatch of this
morning announcing that the Boers had
invaded Xatal and seized Laings Neck
now seems to be without foundation. The
Government has received nothing to Jus
tify the report, although such a move on
the part of the Boers would naturally
cause little surprise..
The British position in Natal was con
siderably strengthened by the arrival to
day of Indian transports with reinforce
ments of about li&.H) infantry, cavalry and
artillery, all of which will be promptly
sent to the front by train and with their
arrival at Glencove and Ladysmith to
morrow or Saturday the British advanced
camps and lines of communication will be
practically safeguarded against the risk
of a successful dash across the frontier
by the Boers.
The military authorities apparently no
longer fear the massing of the Boers
along the border and, in fact, it has been
provided that the Boers shall not make
a sudden invasion in the territory. The
Natal authorities are rather pleased with
this, because they argue that the tension
of waiting will tell severely on the r,<>.>r^'
discipline, and, moreover, they will soon
ously with the cashing of checks given to
the contractors in New York.
In this connection the Attorney General
says:
"The conclusion is forced upon the mind
that Captain Carter, during these
from 1838 to iv.'T. enriched himself to a
large degree in some manner not account
r by his own testimony, and the ir
reslstlhle conclusion, then fore, is that the
true explanation of this rapid access) >n
of wealth is one that he could not safeiy
make, and that it is to be accounted for
only by accepting the theory that he par
ticipated In the fraudulent proceeds of
the contracts under his charge."
The statement o â > as follows:
"I am therefore led to the conclusion
that the court-martial was justified in its
findings of guilty upon the charges and
specifications relating to these contracts
f September, 1896, and that the finding
and sentence of the court with n
thereto should be approved."

NEW DRAMA WRITTEN
BY FRANCIS POWERS
Story of Mexican Life Cleverly Told
Will Soon Be Produced at
the Alcazar.
Francis Powers has written a new play.
And still better he has written a good
play, too. It .- not so very long ago that
"The First Born" became one of those
unexpected .successes that spread like a
disease throughout the country. Those
familiar with literature and the drama
will remember that it was not so much
The book itself which was responsible for
this spontaneous victory, but it was
rathc-r the atmosphere that permeated the
play which occasioned this satisfactory
appreciation. The author was so accurate
in his details, so concise in the descrip
tion of Chinese customs and mode of liv
ing that the very realism became a dra
matic, picture of much value, lience it is
in the strict adherence to general sur
rounding and the creation of a distinct
atmosphere where Mr. Powers' strength
as a playwright may be sought.
While "The First Born" transmitted to
the auditor the Chinese atmosphere, so
his new play, entitled "Mother Earth,"
gives us an idea of Mexican life. The
story in itself Is quite simple. We have
there two native? who are deadly ene
mies. Both love the same girl. One of
them is successful, the other, although
pained at his misfortune, does not seek
revenge. On the day of the wedding,
however, the successful rival challenges
th( unsuccessful one to a quarrel, and
although the latter tries to withdraw, his
enemy forces. :m finally" to draw his
knife and th<s" quarrel end's in the bride
groom being wounded. The wound does
not prove fatal. The bride,. who is blind
owing to some accident, la taken away to
Mexico and In the meantime the bride
groom deserts her for another woman.
On the return of his deserted bride he
is about to marry. The unsuccessful rival
has in the meantime been forgiven by the
blind girl for his haste and told her of
the unfaithfulness of her lover. Upon
the approach of the bride and groom the
deceived girl and her new lover stand
near the church. The girl demands her
companion's knife fearing, as she says,
that he might be tempted to revenge her.
The bridal couple come nearer. The
.blind girl, hearing the bridegroom's voice,
goes toward him, and crying out that she
releases him from his promise stabs her
self. Her companion thereupon runs after
the bridegroom and wants to prevent the
wedding, but ere he can reach him the
former turns and shoots him.
Here, as in "The First Born," it is not
so much the book as the atmosphere
â¢which will make the deepest impression.
The. rural life of the Mexicans, the quaint
customs of the Indians, the deep religious
sentiment prevalent among the Mexican
population and the. love for the plctur
esquo are all brought out strikingly.
Fandangos, Indian war dances, Indian
camping life, Mexican village, life and
Mexican music with which this play is re
plete form the features that will not fail
to make it as successful as "The First
Born." It is certainly a vivid dramatic
picture and will not fail to please the
connoisseur. The Alcazar management,
with its usual enterprising ambition, has
secured the play and is about to rehearse
it. It will be produced within a few weeks
and no expense will be spared to mount
it elaborately.

GRAND JURY PROBES THE

Satisfaction.
Superintendent of Schools R. H. Web

I of Education were before the Grand Jury
yesterday in connection with the Investi

! bribes were accepted by one or more
members of the board from persons inter

furnishing supplies to the department.
j Secretary Blmpson was on the stand for
' some time, but his. testimony did not en
i lighten the inquisitors greatly, and he was
requested to bring in the rejected bids
for stationery supplies for the inspection
I of the jury. While the secretary was gone
1 for the documents Superintendent web
i ster was pluced on the stand and ques
tioned as to the methods of receiving and
I opening bids by the board.
Secretary Simpson soon returned with
j the rejected bids, but the samples that ac
companied them when they were BUbmlt

I the papers of little value as aids in the
investigation. Further Investigation of

THE INDIANS LOSE.
Supreme Court Shuts Them Out of
Their Old Homes.
The Supreme Court has hnnded down a
long decision in the case of J. Downey
Harvey, administrator, and the Mer
chants' Exchanre Hank of San Francisco
against Alejandro Barker and others. Tho
defendants and appellants are Pueblo or
Mission Indians, living In San Diego
County, and they claim on a possessory
right extending back unnumbered years.
The land is In three parcels of 1.907, 2CG.45
and 120 acres.
The plaintiff, representing the estate of
John G. Downey, claims title to the prop
erty under a Mexican grant to Juan Jose
Warner in 1840 and 1844. The Indiana con
tend that this grant specified that their
ancestors and their descendants were not
to be disturbed or interfered with. The
Warner grant was approved by the United
States Government in 188") and a patent
issued therefor. The Supreme Court
holds that in Issuing the patent this Gov
ernment, by its official Land Commission
ers, did so only after a thorough Investi
gation as to all claims adverse to the
patentee, and if no such claims were pre
sented it was to be Inferred that none ex
isted.
The court holds that the decision of the
Land Commissioners of the United States
that the land in question was at the time
It was granted vacant and subject to ab
solute alienation is conclusive on the de
fendants and all others. Also that the
grant of the Vallc de San Jose .was not
subject to any right or v interest in the
Indians, and that the grant is conclusive
ago.inst them. Justices Beatty, Me Par
land and Temple wrote dissenting opin
ions, taking the position that the grant
to Warner, as Interpreted by them; speci
fled that the christianized Mission Indians
and their descendants should not be dis
turbed In their right to live upon at least
gome of the lands. Also that the Indians'
titles to lands like these In question are
not necessary to be presented In the form
of claims to the Land Commissioners
They are wards of the nation and their
rights should have been preserved by the
officials, as poor Lo Is not supposed to
know anything about his rights or the
province of Commissioners.

THE GUNBOAT
URDANETA IS
RECOVERED
Expedition Sent Out for the
Purpose Returns to Ca
vite With the Craft.
BRINGS ONE PRISONER
Town of Orani, Where the Vessel
Was Sunk, Was Bombarded
and Natives Evacuated.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
MANILA, Oct. 6.â The expedition sent
to the Orani River under the command of
I Captain Cornwell to recover the sunken
I gunboat Urdaneta returned to Cavlte yes-
I terday with the hull of the boat, after
bombarding Orani and landing a force.
Captain Cornwell brought ona prisoner.
Lieutenant Brennan of the gunboat
Laguna de Bai headed the expedition.
I There wero no casualties.
On Monday morning the expedition en
tered the river and anchored above Orani,
near the Urdaneta, the inhabitants of the
town simultaneously evacuating it,
carrying their belongings with them.
The gunboats bombarded Orani, the
beaches and the surrounding country for
h;ul" an hour, receiving a Mauser volley
in return.
The I'rda.neta was towed off the bar
about 10 o'clock that evening, the opera
tions of the Americans being unmolested.
The following morning the bombard
ment was if opened to cover a landing of I
ISO bluejackets and marines about half !
a mile above the town. On entering Orani j
the Americans experienced a slight rifle j
lire from the Filipinos in the trenches. |
They found the town untenanted, and j
that the shells had ignited a few huts, j
The Archbishop of Manila informed
General Otis that there was a plot on
foot to burn the residences of the Gov
ernor General and the Archbishop, to
gether with soverai Government buildings
and banks, but the plot failed to materl- I
alize, possibly because of a display of j
force.
The first reports regarding the affair
at Paranicjue last night appear to have
been much exaggerated. The facts are
that a small band of Insurgents, follow
ing the bay road, poured a volley into the
village and later another into Los Pinos,
with the iesult that two or three houses
were burned. The cracking of the bam
boo caused it to be reported in Manila
that there had been much shooting.
The United States transport Warren,
from San Francisco, with 1200 recruits
has arrived. The United States gunboat
ling, from Vancouver, March 3, via
Honolulu, while passing St. Vincent in
Northern Luzon, shot down a Filipino
flag. The Filipinos tired a shot at the
Wheeling's men, who were sleeping on
deck, and the Wheeling bombarded the
settlement.
ARRANGING TO SEND
SHIPS TO PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON, Oct. The Navy De
partment was busily engaged to-day in
arranging to reinforce the fleet in the
Philippines, as suggested yesterday by
Admiral Dewey at his conference with the I
President. It was found that the. plan
conceived last evening; of sending the
j Marietta and the Machtaa with the Brook- ,
' lyn would have to be modified so as to
I drop the two gunboats.
By noon the department had completed
its programme and was in a position to
send orders to the ships chosen, to go. |
The New Orleans was the first tele- ,
graphed to proceed to the New York
Navy Yard to have some changes made
in the galley apparatus. These can be
made in six days, when the ship will start
on her voyage. The Brooklyn will bo
turned back from Hampton Roads and ,
sent to New York, whence she sailed this
morning before the department could ,
reach her with orders. She will be ready
to sail by the end of next week. A cable
gram was sent to the Nashville at San ]
Domingo to proceed at once to Manila
via the Suez canal and she Is expected to j
get out within twenty-four hours. Orders â 
i were also telegraphed to the Badger at ;
Mare Island to proceed to the Philippines
as soon as possible. No orders have as â¢
yet been sent to the Bancroft at Boston. !
It was suggested at the Navy Depart
ment that three of the four vessels now
under orders for Manila pass through the
I Suez canal and so be available to divert
to South Africa, should matters there take
; shape requiring the presence of a United
States naval force.
General Otis has informed the "War De- |
â  partment of the arrival at Manila of the
transport Athenian with a detachment of
the Third Cavalry and horses. There
were no casualties on the voyage.
The Secretary of War has issued an i
; order discontinuing the military depart
ment of the gulf and merging it into the
Department of the East, under command
of Major General Wesley Merritt, with
headquarters at New York.

SOUTH DAKOTA
MEN GET COIN
AND FREEDOM
Mustered Outand Paid
Off Yesterday.
The South Dakota men were mustered
out yesterday, and at nightfall there was
not one of them to be seen at the camp.
They were paid from $120 up, and every
body around the y tents was rolling in
wealth. There was much enthusiasm,
and one of the companies, when It had
been paid and the men had safely
pocketed their discharges, lined up in
front of Colonel Frost's tent and gnvo
three cheers for their regimental com
mander.
There la some hitch In the arrangements
for the departure -of the regiment, and it
is not probable that it will get away be
fore to-morrow evening, or It may be
longer than that. The trains have been
spoken for from the Northern Pacific and
they have been promised, but they are
not ready and they will not be ready
for at least a day. In the meantime the
men cannot remain at the Presidio, and
they have been compelled to seek quarters
downtown. It has been the custom bo
far to allow every regiment to remain in
camp through the night after the muster
out, but this has not been done In the
case of the South Dakotas. The com
mand was ordt-red to make away with
its straw and litter, and to turn In all
ticks and pillows furnished by the post.
Colonel Frost announced to the men that
he would have the time for the departure
of the train published In all the news
papers as soon as he could find out for
certain just when it would be ready. The
men have scattered all over the city,
however, and it will be lucky If there is
not a larije percentage of them left be
hind.
The following farewell order, In souve
nir form, was Issued by Colonel Frost. A
copy was given to each man in the regi
ment:
Headquarters First South. Dakota Infantry,
CROCKER HOME TO BE
USED AS A HOSPITAL
CHARLES CROCKER RESIDENCE AT SACRAMENTO.
SACRAMENTO, Oct 6.â The announcement this afternoon that the Crocker
Estate Company had mode a gift of the Charles Crocker residence in this city
to the hospital service of the Southern Pacific occasioned small surprise here,
inasmuch as the home has been unoccupied for several years.
Once it was one of the handsomest in this part of the State. It occupies a
half block at Ninth and F streets, and the mansion sits upon the crest of a gently
sloping terrace. It is to be said of the Crocker home that, while it has been
practically deserted for years so far as the Crockers are concerned, nevertheless
it has been well kept up, and the grounds are as green and as redolent of floral
fragrance as In the days when Charles Crocker and his wife entertained so
elaborately there. Perhaps a measure of sentiment Impelled the Crockers to
maintain the home place of their parents, for it was in a little house which stood
on the northeast corner or the present grounds that George, Hattie, William and
Frederick Crocker were born, while but half a block away was the little brick
public primary school where they learned their early lessons. When Charles
Crocker began to accumulate wealth from the earnings of the Central Pacific
Railroad he sold off the little house, and, purchasing the rest of the half block,
built the present stately mansion. It was here that th.c family lived and enter
tained up to the time when they took up their residence on No s Hill, San Fran
cisco. A distinguishing feature of the Crocker home is a brace i I fan palms,
standing nearly sixty feet high.
The old Central Pacific Hospital in this city will be abandoned, and such of
the patients as are not sent to the San Francisco Hospital will be quartered In
the old Crocker home.

M of tlie South Dakota regiment died at
the smallpox hospital at the Presidio
Wednesday last. His death was reported
yesterday morning. There was some dis
cussion over the disposal of the body,
but Colonel Glrard, chief surgeon of the
general hospital, settled tho question by
ordering that he he buried in the Na
tional Cemetery. The pray.* was dug by
the men employ* <1 at the cemetery, and
then they left the place, while the work
waa finished by the brave men who are
raring for tho sufferers at the isolated
hospital. Chaplain Macomber of the Pre
sidlo attended the funeral and repeated
the services for the dead over the lonely
mound. There was no one there but the
nurses and the chaplain. The body was
a m< nace to health as long as it remained
unburied, so it was hurried to the grave
the evening of the day the man died.
Swell Colored Shirts
We selected a lot of Scotch Madras and had them made into shirts
for us, and it has been done as well as any shirt manufacturer
can do it.
The patterns are not like the ordinary $1.50 or $2.00 ready-made
shirts, but are the same patterns as particular persons go to their shirt-
maker tor an.! pay S3- 00 or so.
And we think that the fit and finish of our shirts are as good as
these high-priced affairs. We will have them in the windowâ what

GAZED INTO TIE
ENGINEER'S FACE
Then the Cruel Train
Killed Her.
We do further find that this
was an accident caused by the
carelessness of deceased, Lor
enzo Ciardella, and further by
the fact of there being no elec
tric light burning at the time
of the accident, so as to enable
the gateman to see the ap
proaching cars; and we, the
jury, further recommend that
the Southern Pacific Company
do better protect their cross
ings.
Such was the essential portion of the |
vfrdict of the Coroner's jury rendered
lay morning at the inquest on the j
bodies of 1/orf-nzr. Ciardella, aged 31. and j
his Infant daughter Filomena, aged 20
months, who were killed last Sunday
nlng on the Sunnyslde railroad cross-
Dg by a train of cars of the Southern
Pacific Company.
J. R. Kurd, the engineer of the train,
:Â«stined that the train was going at about
wenty miles an hour and that he saw the '
. ar containing the deceased and his j
family on the track about seventy-five
feet ahead. He at once put on the
-morppney brakes and blew his whistle.
â â¢)!â¢. you ever killed anybody before?"
iskrd Coroner Hill with an air of pro
fessional curiosity.
"Yes," replied the engineer.
"Lots of people?**
"I didn't krÂ«-p track of them. I have
not killed more than five or six. I have
seen railroading twenty-seven years, and
in my first ten years I didn't kill any
body. The sight affected me very much.
It was pad, the last thing I saw before
the cart wap struck, that little baby's
fnce looking into mlno from her seat on
the can as ?he turned her face back
toward ihe engine."
E. N. Stevens, the gateman of the
Southern Pacific Company at that point,
paid that ho was in the gatehouse when
he heard the whistle blow. He went out
side with his lantern and saw the horse
and cart cropping the track. He shouted
to the driver to come right across, which
the deceased "i plenty of time to do,
but he turned tho horse partly around,
and drove him up the track In the same
direction In which the train was going.
The gates had not been In use for about ;
a month. There was only one electric
light burning, but a telegraph pole near
It cast a dark shadow across the track
at that po'r.t.
The electric lights were not usually lit
until, abotit half past 7 In the evening.
Nothing new was elicited by the testi
mony of the other witnesses.
In the Divorce Court.
Decrees of divorce have been granted
Julia Pullen from E. J. Pullen for cruelty.
Mary New by from Axel J. Newby for
willful desertion, Annie Butler from
James F. Butler for failure to provide,

Oliver L. Hall's action for a divorce from
his wife, Susie Hall, was submitte
: v Judge Sea well. Hall claimed
his wife deserted him In 1893 and
went to Philadelphia. She sent an an-
Bwer from the East. In which sh" denied
that Fhe deserted him, but claimed that
her husband had never sent her money
on which to return. Lena A. Burke has
reconciled to her husband. Harry A.
Iturk<\ and the suit instituted by her for
divorce will be dismissed. Burke came
into court yesterday and filed a confes
sion, in which he begged condonation and
forgiveness for his acts of cruelty, agreed
that he would never mistreat his wife
again and would install hor in a com
fortable home. His offer wns accepted
and Judge Hunt was delighted at the
outcome of the litigation.

sertion have been filed by Sophie Schulz

THERE Is no objection to a star play

whole success of "Innocent as a

Sow, this same Tobias was a right mirth

Eugene Ormonde is the man for a

SURPRISES
That May Happen
When
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
Is
In General Use.
RESCUED TEKOA
SAILORS ARRIVE
ON THE GIFFORD
Picked Up in a Boat
Off Cape Horn.
The British ship Glfford arrived from
Cardiff yesterday afternoon with five of
the crew of the British steamer Tekoa
aboard. The men were greatly relieved
to hear that the steamer, passengers and
crew were all right, as ever since August
last they have been under the impression
that they were the only ones saved from
the wreck.
Tire Tekoa left Wellington, X. 7.., on
July 3D for London with a number of
passengers and a cargo of. frozen mutton.
While passing through the Straits of
Le Maire she struck an unknown object
[ and b^gan to fill. The water poured Into
; the fore peak and fore hold, but luckily
the collision bulkheads kept the water
I out of the rest of the ship. Over 20,000
I carcasses of sheep were jettisoned and the
steamer lightened up so that on August
10 she was able to reach Port Stanley.
There she was patched up and sent to
Montevideo, where she is now being over
hauled.
When the steamer Tekoa struck there
j was a great deal of ex<"ite^ient aboard
i and everybody thought the ship was go
| Ing down. There was a general rush
; for the boats, but the captain and oflicers
J prevented anybody from getting into
i theijj. I'he second mate and the four
| sailors took the stations assigned to them
I in one of ir.e boats, however, and by some
j means or another got adrift, rtley lost
! sight of ihe Tekoa and tried to head for
| Stanley, thinking the steamer had gone
; dow^i with all hands. They were none
! too warmly clad and suffered terribly
I from the cold. They labored at the oars
, in order to keep the blood in circulation,
but all were frost-bitten and ready to
give up Ihe* struggle wh<-n the Clifford,
bound for San Francisco, hove in sight
and pick -d them up.
In the meantime the Tekoa had arrived
at Port Stanley and the captain was feel
ing worse over the loss of the second
mate and the four men than he did over
the accident to the ship. He chartered a
small sc mi oner and sent her out to look
for the missing boat, "tout no trace of her
could lie found, as the Glfford had been
there beforehand.
The transports Zealandla, City of Paia
and Valencia got away for Manila last
nitjht. Seven companies and the heati
quarters r.nd staff of the Twenty-ninth
)<â¢ giment went out on the Zealandia, and
the rciii. lining companies on the City of
I'ara. The Valencia took nv. ay f>l!'j re
cruits for the regiments now in th.i
Philippines. There were very few people
down to see the boys away, and the men
mndo no attempts to get outride the en
closure. In consequence there was wry
little excitement over the departure of
the transports. Six boys tried to stow
tli*-mF<-lv.-s away on the Zealandia and
t itv of Para, but were discovered and put
ashore-. Some of the lads had followed
the regiment here and were very much
disappointed because they could not get
to Manila with their friends.
The log raft was towed into port by
the tugs Rescue and Monarch yesterday.
As Boon as it was sighted the tugs Relief,
Alert and Redmond went to the as
sistance of the Rescue and Monarch, am ; .
the live boats safely anchored the huge
pile of lumber in Mission Bay. Captain
Thompson of the Rescue picked the dere
lict up off Lompoc at 7 a. m., September
27. After some trouble the Rescue mide
fast, and at the rate of one mile an hour
towed her into Port Ilarford. When the
Monarch reached Port Harford the two
tups started for San Francisco with iho
derelict. Off Point Sur a heavy head sea
was met and a number of the piles
washed our. Quite a big piece of the raft
is gone, but there is enough left to more
than pay expenses.
The hull of that City of New York, that
â was wrecked on Point Bonlta a number
of years ago, Is to be broken up.\ After
several .unsuccessful attempts had been
made to raise the vessel the engines, boll
ers, masts and gear were removed and
the hull abandoned. The price of Iron
has advanced of late and it is now worth
while to recover the plates in the hull of
the New York. T. P. H. Whltelaw has
fitted the wrecking schooner Catalina out
with new hoists and engines and to-day
she will be anchored off Point Bonlta and
four divers will go to work on the wreck.
There Is over a thousand tons of iron in
the hull of the New York, and Whitelaw
expects to recover it at the rate of 100
tons a day.
One of the crew of the schooner North
Bend went crazy yesterday and jumped
overboard. He was fished out of the
water and sent ashore on the tug Alert.
It took six policemen to Ret him into the
patrol wagon and out to the City Hall,
where he was placed in a padded cell.
He is a mulatto and is subject to fits of
temporary insanity.
Joseph Lester, an A. B. on the British
ship Falrport. attempted to kill John
Cameron, the carpenter, with a hatch bar
yesterday. There has been considerable
111 feeling between the men ever since the
vessel left Australia. Lester was put in
irons and the police called in. When Of
ficer I, vie Shaw went to arrest Lester he
found the sailors lowering him to the
wharf from the forecastle head. Shaw
secured his man and charged him at the
Harbor police station with an assault
with a deadly weapon.
The bark Harvester and ship George
Skolfleld had a reminder of the upheaval
in Alaska while on their way here from
the canneries. On September 22 and 23
they were caught in a hurricane and both
lost sails and received other damage. The
wind shifted all around the compass and
neither captain can ever remember expe
riencing such weather in Alaskan waters
before.
H. Koorflt of 1572 Railroad avenue was
hurt on the steamer North Fork yester
day. One of the slings knocked him off a
pile of lumber, fracturing his collarbone
and the base of his skull. He was treated
at the Harbor Hospital.
A boy named F. Reimers received a
very painful bite on the front yesterday.
He was petting a horse, when the brute
took the boy's entire face In its mouth
and would have bitten it off had not the
driver struck It over the head. Retmerg
was treated at the Harbor Hospital by
Dr. Morrison, and was then sent to his
home at 120 Howard street.
THE MARIPOSA SAILS.
Departure Was Dalaypd Owing to
Late Transcontinental Mnil?!
Th*Â» Oceanic Steamship Company*!
steamship Mariposa sailed shortly before
10 o'clock last evening. The vessel's de
parture was delayed for some hours
owing to the fire in the Sierra Nevada
sii'iwsheds that held Southern Pacific
trains and Eastern mall at Truckee until
nearly one mile of track could be taken
up ar.d reiaid. The Marlposa's destina
tion is Sydney, and she satis via Hono
lulu and Auckland. On bonrd was a large
passenger list for way tx >r ts as well as
Australia. Cocker TWeedie, the pugilist,
who came to the Pacific Coast some time
ago as the lightweight champion of Aus
tralia, returned as cabin boy on the Mati
posa to his home.

Again Denounced the "Voice."
The Building Trades' Council at its
meeting last evening reaffirmed its decis
ion regarding the Voice of Labor. At a
previous meeting the council denounced
the paper as one not worthy to be the
representative of laboring men, and re
quested all bodies connected with the
council to withdraw their patronage from
it and to cease to recognize it in any
form. The action of last night was
brought about by an attempt of Union 22
to have the council reopen the case for
tho Introduction of new evidence. The
grievance of the council is that the man
agement of tho paper la Inimical to or
ganized labor.
RETIREMENTS OF
POLICEMEN SAID
TO BE ILLEGAL
Majority of the Board
Not Present.
There was considerable talk in police
circles yesterday concerning' the retire
ment of Sergeant Avan and Policemen
Hall, Libby and Hayden on Wednesday
night by tho Police Pension Board, and
also the retirement Monday of Policeman
Wilson.
The legality of the action of the board
is seriously questioned from the fact that
only one member was present (Commis
sioner Alvord), the other two Commis
sioners being out of the city. It is dis
tinctly laid down in the act creating the
pension board that "a majority of all the
members of said board herein provided
for shall constitute a quorum and have
power to transact business." There could
bo nothing plainer than that, and as It
requires two to make a majority of the
three Commissioners, the proceedings as
to the retirement of the men in question
are illegal.
The chief of Police was present besides
Commissioner Alvord, but he is only the
secretary of the board and not a member,
although he wrongly contends that he
is a member both of the Police and Pen
sion boards. The act says: "They shall
organise as such board by chooning one
of their number as chairman and by ap
pointing a secretary." President Tobln
occupies the one position and the Chief
of Police for the time being the other.
When the Board of Pollc? Commissioners
was created by the MiCoppin act it was
specified that it would consist of three
Commissioners, together with the then
Chief <>f Police elected by the people; but
a subsequent clause distinctly states that
afterward the board will consist of the
three Commissioners, who shall have
power to appoint a Chief of Police. At
the time of the passing of the act Chief
Kilpatrick was in office by election, and
h<- was the only Chief who was a Com
mlssioner. After the appointment of Chief
Crowley he was asked to attend the meet
ings of the board, not as a member but as
chief, to advise with the board on the
business before it. But it is pointed out
th.it, assuming Chief Lees' contention is
right that he is a member of the board,
two cannot be called a majority of four,
and the proceedings of the board would
still be illegal. It was hinted that some
of the officers retired will test the ques
tion.
A NORTH BEACH FRACAS.
Cousin of Colonel Breckinridge Occu
pies a Drunk Cell.
A rather mixed up family row happened
on Mason street, near Filbert, last even-
Ing and ended in the arrest of W. J.
Breckinridge, a cousin of ex-Congress
man Breckinridge of Kentucky, on a
charge of drunk. Mrs. Breckinridge had
been badly beaten by a Mrs. Hanson, who
resides in the Breckinridge home, at 716
Bay street, and sought refuge in the
house of Mrs. Mary Ward. Breckinridge
followed her there, and is said to have
raised a disturbance. The cries of Mrs.
Ward attracted the attention of Officer
Kelly and he placed the man under arrest.
Both the wife and Mrs. Ward talked of
more serious charges, which they threaten
to place against the prisoner this mora
ine.

COMMENCED BY EDUCATORS.
rROM the moment the p!an of The Call for
curses of home study for its readers
under the direction of some of the f or>. :
â nitted to the con
. ged in the work of educa
tion their cordial approval and commenda
tion. Tiicir praise has been given frankly and in em
phatic words. They have perceived in the plan a
movement in the direction of higher journalism and
popular culture and have been prompt to recommend
it to the public.
Mrs. Mills, president of Mills College, in a letter
to The Call, says: "Your plan of presenting to the
readers of The Ef^jent courses of study will, I
am sure, commend itself to all who are interested
in good journalism and in the proper education of
the public. I heartily indorse the plan and shall be
glad to commend it to our faculty and students, and
through them to their friends."'
President Wheeler of Berkeley says: "Your plan
of readings for the home study circle is admirable.
The list of contributors brings together a remarkable
body of men, all recognized leaders in the fields they
represent. I bid you godspeed in your undertaking."
President Jordan of Stanford says: "I am very
much in sympathy with the home study circle work
which The Call is now taking up. I am personally
acquainted with most of the men and women engaged
in writing for the circle, and I know them to be
among the most eminent of American scholar?."
These statements from such high authorities show
the sentiment of educators generally on the subject.
In a certain sense Mrs. Mills, President Wheeler and
President Jordan represent the educational force of
the commonwealth and express the thoughts of all
engaged in the work of instruction. Our cours
6tudy are therefore recommended to the public by
authorities whom ell will respect, and are entitled to
the careful consideration of every family in the State.
When once the series has begun the papers will
carry their own recommendation. They will have
â lent merit to attract and to hold the attention of
intelligent readers. Writers of such established repute
as Edward Dowden. William J. Rolfe. Hiram Corson,
Albert S. Cook. Isaac N. Demmon, Albert Bushnell
Hart, John Bach McMaster, Charles H. Smith. An
drew C. McLaughlin, John C. Van Dyke, Russell
V L. Frothinghatn Jr., Mrs. Helen Camp
bell, Mrs. Margaret K. Sangster, Mrs. Kate Gannet
Miss Lucy Wheelock and Miss Anna Bar
rows hardly need any introduction or indorsement
to recommend them to the favor of the American
people. President Jordan has rightly characterized
them as among "the most eminent of American
scholars." The studies which they will contribute
will prove of instruction and of interest to every
household, and The Call will be more valuable than
ever to its readers.
SOMETHING TO BOAST OF.
OUR esteemed contemporary, the Examiner,
published yesterday morning with much dis
play a brief telegram announcing that the
telegraph line from Skaguay to Dawson has been
completed and that the dispatch itself was the first
newspaper message sent over it. Having reached
Skaguay, the telegram was brought down by mail
to New Westminster and thence sent by wire, reach
ing our contemporary within six days after having
been dispatched from Dawson. "Now," says the
Examiner with pride, "this is something to boast of."
It is indeed something for the Examiner to boast
of, since it has the appearance of being legitimate
news and not a fake. It has that appearance because
it does not purport to have been a piece of enterprise
on the part of the Examiner, but of the Yukon Sun.
It is a somewhat important piece of information, and
â ,ye are glad to note that our contemporary is at least
trying to gather news and has sense enough to recog
nize it when sent in by outsiders.
We must, however, direct the attention of the Ex
aminer to the fact that the most important item of
current news to all the world at this time is the success
of The Call's wireless telegraph service under the di
rect supervision of the gifted inventor, Marconi. In
comparison with the feats which the new telegraphy
has accomplished in reporting the yacht race, the
opening of a wire line between Skaguay and Dawson
is a very insignificant thing.
By the enterprise of the Yukon Sun the Examiner
gets a message of some sixty words from Dawson
within six days. A pretty feat truly, and one of which
the Yukon Sun has a right to boast. But think of
receiving messages from far out at sea, messages ag
gregating many thousands of words, transmitted
across the continent and bulletined in three minutes.
That is something to boast of.
Wireless telegraphy is the most important, the most
interesting and the most marvelous news item of the
time. By means of it The Call is giving to the pub-
He bulletins from the races far ahead of its contem
poraries. A revolution has. in fact, been effected in
ithering. A new era in telegraphy has begun.
From every part of the civilized world men of science,
bankers, merchant princes, commanders of armies and
rmvies and great statesmen are watching intently the
wonderful fents now being performed by the magic
science and genius of the gifted Italian youth who
j--. serving the public through The Call and the New
York Herr.ld. Still our sluggish contemporaries
know litt> of nil that is going on. Their readers
Itr-.rn nothing of the man-els of wireless telegraphy,
but are told with immense display of big type that
it is something to boast of that a message has been
sent by wire from Dawson to Skaguay.
MARCONI'S GREAT TRIUMPH.
RARELY if ever in the history of the world has it been the fortune of the inventor!
of an epoch-making instrument of science to demonstrate its value to the world un
der circumstances so exciting, so universally interesting and so dramatic as those
which have accompanied Marconi's demonstration of the efficacy of wireless telegraphy
in reporting the international yacht race, and equally rare has been anything like the tri
umphant success which he has attained.
The international yacht races for the America's cup are the most costly, the most
fascinating and the most universally interesting sporting events of the world. They at
tract the attention of almost the entire populations of two great nations. Long before
they occur every important newspaper in America and Great Britain makes extensive and
elaborate preparations to furnish the public with the fullest and promptest bulletins of the
race possible. The Associated Press and every other news gathering agency give their
aid in the work and as a rule no expense is spared to get the news and to publish it with
the utmost rapidity.
In the event of this year the public interest in the contest has been exceptionally
great. Ample tests have made it clear that the two yachts are the fleetest as well as the
most expensive ever designed for racing purposes. All the shipbuilding skill of Britain
and America is illustrated in the two boats. All the resources of wealth have been placed
at the disposal of the builders: Each nation has done its best, and now the races are to
show which has excelled in the rivalry.
As the yachts represent all that British or American skill can do in the way of con
structing such vessels, so do the arrangements made by the press to obtain the news
represent all that the civilized world can do in that direction. Everything that can be ac
complished by dispatch boats, by signals, by telegraph wires was provided for by the
greater newspapers of the country, Nothing was left to chance or accident. All was
foreseen and prepared for. The old system of news gathering perfected by long experi- :
ence was strained to its utmost and was at its best. Could any new system surpass it?
Experiments made by Marconi in Great Britain proved that wireless telegraphy is a;
possibility. The record-making feat of The Call in getting early information of the ar-i
rival of the Sherman off the Golden Gate showed it could be relied upon to do its work"
promptly when the emergency required. Therefore while the other papers of the coun
try and the Associated Press were arranging for reporting the races by the old system The
Call and its ally, the New York Herald, entered into negotiations with Marconi and;
brought the inventor to Xew York to match his telegraphy against the old.
From every point of view the contest between the rival telegraph systems is more im
portant and to all intelligent men it is more interesting than the rivalry of the yachts. j
The two systems were matched in the race on Tuesday and the victory was on the side of
the wireless telegraph. Another contest was made yesterday. The Associated Press and ;
the papers that have mocked at wireless telegraphy put forth every effort to redeem the j
former failure. The result was a triumph for Marconi so overwhelming that it is in every j
respect astounding.
It is not too much to say that The Call was yesterday the only paper in the city to '
give the news of the race to those who watched the bulletin boards. The other papers'
would have done better to wait for the mails. We publish this morning in parallel col- !
umns some of the dispatches received by wireless telegraphy with bulletins correspond-'
ing in point of time put forth by the Examiner. The contrast exhibits in the most strik- j
ing manner the superiority in point of speed and accuracy of the work of the Marconi |
system. The reports of the Examiner and of the Associated Press were late; they were;
unreliable; they were not news. The Marconi telegrams outclassed them in every way.
The result was The Call gave the news currently as the race went on and the yachts
drifted over the course, while the other papers gave out bulletins that might just as well
have been faked up in the office.
A notable feature of the event is the manner in which papers pretending to give the
news to their readers have suppressed these man-els of new telegraphy. Here is what
is the greatest of recent scientific marvels working before all the world and yet not only
jealous newspapers but even the Associated Press fails to give any information of it what
ever. Such jealousy is unworthy of journalism, for it destroys the very essence of journal
ism, which is the prompt publication to the world of every item of current interest.
A special exhibit of jealousy on the part of the Examiner is worth noting because!
it is characteristic ot that paper. When in an over-sanguine reliance upon its methods
of getting the news it thought the Marconi system had failed or at least had for a mo-j
ment broken down, the Examiner put forth a slurring bulletin about "'wireless Maca-i
roni." It was a mean taunt at best, for Marconi is soon to be the guest of the nation,
one honored by the Government, for he is to assist in providing a telegraphic system for
the navy to use between vessels at sea. As such he is entitled to decent treatment from
the American people. The slur is doubly mean, moreover, because it carries with it a slur
upon the whole Italian people, of whom Marconi is one of the most eminent. It is but a
dull wit as well as bad manners to attempt to ridicule one of the foremost inventors of all
time by calling him "Macaroni" because, he was born in Italy and bears the name of
Marconi.
For all such slurs, however, the inventor of wireless telegraphy will care little, if indeed
he care at all. lie has matched his system against the old when the old was straining
every resource and he has attained a genuine triumph. The Call is proud to be associated
in this crowning glory of journalism. It requires a liberal expenditure of money and tire
less energy to get the news ahead of all competitors, but The Call does it.
THE CUBAN QUESTION.
WHILE the harassing guerrilla warfare waged
by Aguinaldo and his followers holds public
attention to the affairs of the Philippines, there
is evidently going on quietly but persistently an ef
fort on the part of certain strong influences in the
East to establish in Cuba a protectorate which will
end only with the annexation of the island to the
United States, peaceably if we can, forcibly if we
must.
This evidence is to be found in the reports of
special correspondents writing from Cuba to the
leading imperial organs of the East and setting forth
with much elaboration the excellence of our admin
istration there, the number and variety of benefits
that are being conferred upon the people, the bright
prospects of commerce and the inability of either of
the parties among the Cubans to establish or main
tain a stable government of their own.
â¢By such means the people of the country are being
educated into the belief that it is to be a part of the
"White Man's Burden" of the taxpayers of the
United States to provide for the civilization of Cuba.
At the same time assurances are given that the work
cannot be done speedily. We must supervise the
Cubans for a long time, according to these authori
ties, before they will be fitted to manage their owr
politics and administer their own government.
Thus a correspondent of the Washington Post re
cently said: "In the organization of government in all
its branches, the education of the people the develop
ment of the resources of the island, the training in
municipal and government work, the United States
has years of work before it. And it would seem that
it had not performed its duty toward humanity, be
gun in the sacrifice of the blood of its own sons, un
til it had carried out its work and given the full meas
ure of Cuban independence. Then if Cuba wants an
nexation, and votes for it, the proposition may be
considered. Annexation means delivery for a million
human beings. There is no other expedient. TJie
people of Cuba have not learned self-government and
cannot acquire it by instinct."
It is not to be doubted that ample reasons will be
forthcoming when Congress meets for providing for
an indefinite occupation of Cuba. The annexationist3
in the United States will be aided by the annexation
ists in the islands, and there are large financial inter
ests in New York, Boston and Philadelphia to furnish
the money required to make an annexation campaign.
Should it be necessary for the purpose of affecting
public opinion, oriof influencing Congress to bring
about something of disturbance in the islands to" prove
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. OCTOBER 6. 1599.
the unfitness of the people for self-government, it
will not be hard for these various forces to accom
plish it.
There are already on the horizon signs of prepara
tions made to retard the organization of an indepen
dent Cuban government. It has been announced from
Havana that a movement has been started there to
form a government from which the negro race will
be excluded. Such a movement' would of course
precipitate a race issue at once and fill the island with
confusion. The cry of the annexationists would then
be that it is the duty of the United States to estab
lish peace before it withdrew its forces. That would
mean, in turn, the indefinite occupation of the island.
It seems fairly certain, therefore, that we are to
have a Cuban as well as a Philippine question to
settle at the coming session of Congress. The
declarations we made in favor of Cuban independence
at the beginning of the war with Spain are to count
for nothing. The imperialists would have us treat
that country as the British have treated Egypt, and
the great principles upon which our Government is
founded are to be sacrificed in the interests of im
perialism and territorial aggrandizement.
Superintendent Webster is said to be greatly con
cerned by reason of the fact that pupils in some of
the north end schools are given to the habit of
throwing stones. So far, probably owing to the fact
that certain members of the Board of Education are
such artful dodgers, none of the missiles have found
a mark.
Advices from Mexico are to the effect that a party
of telegraph linemen were recently killed near Ortiz
by hostile Indians. It will not lessen the sorrow of
the bereaved relatives to know that such a tragedy
could not have occurred had wireless telegraphy been
established in that country.
The local Democracy has the satisfaction of know
ing that it required almost the desperation of a riot
!to nominate a Board of Supervisors. The gentle
men of that political faith are probably aware that
| it would excite more than a riot to elect the nominees.
General Castro, so the dispatches announce, has
: succeeded Caceres as President of Venezuela and is
busy sawing wood for his Cabinet. It is true they
have had no election in Venezuela, but nobody will
deny that Castro ran for the office.
The people who have always asserted that Alaska
is no great shakes evidently didn't count on the earth
quakes.

PRESS COMMENTS

Colusa Sun.
In discussing the Oriental trade San
Francifcco people have insisted on the Ni
caragua canal as a betiefit to them. The
. Sun years ago took issue and insisted that
I co far as trade with the Orient was con
cerned the canal would prove detrimental
to that city. A superficial talker by 'the
name of Barrett seemed to set the mer
chants of the metropolis wild about the
I coming trade with the Orient, but he went
i on to tell them about how it was neres
! sary to have another Senator in order
I that we might get the canal, and he
si emed to take it for granted that San
: Francisco wanted that great waterway in
! order to foster her trade with China and
i the islands. The Call took him up on it
| and says a great deal in the following few
words:
"The west coast of South America lies
east of New York. When the canal is
built that coast will be nearer to New
â  York than to San Francisco. Therefore,
i if nearness is an element in the problem,
! New York will do the trade of that coast
which we do new. Again. New York's
| trade with the Orient now has to go
I around Cape Horn or the Cape of Good
Hopi ; or, avoiding this doubling of either
I continent, it passes the Pillars of Htr
cules and travels by the Mediterranean
and the Suez canal. When the Nlcara
i pua canal is built San Francisco will be
I no nearer the Orient than now, but the
distance from New York to the Orient
â¢will b* cut one-half:"

DEEP-SKA THERMOMETERâ A- O.
S., City. There is an instrument known
as the deep-sea thermometer, and it is
described as follows: The thermometer is
so arranged that it is automatically
turned upside down when the machinery
begins to draw it up from the depth at
i tbi temperature Is to be ascer
tained. The effect of the inverting pro
c< .-.- is to break the column of mercury,
and a small portion of the column re
mains in the upper end of the tube, ex
actly enough tri i m;.- nature
at the moment of Inversion. The tube is
graduated so as to read from either end
and the quantity of mercury In the upper
part of the tube is so small that it does
not respond to any but gmit and sudden
changes of temperature. So the reading
when th'- j thermometer reaches the sur
face is practically correct.
NATIONALITY-TV T. 8., City. The
answer given in this department a few
days since in relation to nationality was
correct. It makes no difference what the
rationality of the parents may be the na
tionality of the child is that of the coun
try in which It was born. A child born
in France is French, one born in the
United States is American and so on. A
child of white parents born in China is
Chinese just the same as a child born to
Chinese parents in England is bnglisn.
There is a difference, however, between
ationality and citizenship. A child
born to foreign parents in any country
may, on attaining majority, elect to be
come a citizen <.f the country of the fa
ther or be a citizen of the country in
which he was born. For instance, a man
who was born in the United States of
foreign parents, .say the father was a
German, can. when he becomes twenty
one years of age. decide by his acts

<r? <r?ORACE DAVIS has been chosen
â  â¢ " I to bear the standard of the Re
publicans In the municipal cam
,i ii pilgn. In the midst of a scene
of perhaps unrivaled enthusiasm
in a local political convention he was
nominated last night for the position of
Mayor. Whatever factional disturbances
may have manifested themselves In the
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 0. 1899
convention they were silenced in the cry
of a common cause. The name of Horace
Davis drew from every member of the
convention a cheer of hearty support and
enthusiasm. Cheer after oheer rang
through B'nai B'rlth Hall a3 the stan
dard bearer was placed in nomination.
Men threw their hats in the air, jumped
upon chairs and shouted themselves
hoarse in welcoming the man who is to
lead them in the campaign.
As his long record of distinguished
public service and honorable private life
was eloquently told the delegates could
not control themselves, and above the
words of the speaker upon the platform
arose the great roar, of his hearers In an
ecstacy of excitement. If ever a man en
tered a political campaign under favor
able auspices Horace Davis began his
fight last night for the position of Mayor
anned 1 at every point. When the con
vention chose him for the post of honor
on the municipal ticket the work of
nominating was finished.
The session had been one of excitement.
The first stubborn fight of the night came
when nominations for Police Judges were
called. William A. Deane had been nora
mated for County Clerk, John Lackmann
for Sheriff and Dr. A. D. McLean for
Coroner. Then the chairman mildly de
clared nominations for Police Judges in
order. There was a murmur and buzz of
excitement In the galleries, which were
crowded by outside supporters of Police
Judge Thomas F. Graham. This official
had failed to Fecure the caucus nomina
tion and his friends determined to defeat
the will of the caucus if possible. L.. G.
Carpenter, Charles A. Low. James L.
Nagle, H. L. Joachimsen and Thomas P.
Graham were placed in nomination. Gra
ham's name was received with the utmost
enthusiasm. Time after time his nomina
tion was seconded, not only by represen
tatives of the minority, but of the ma
jority as well. Before the vote was taken
it seemed as If he certainly would win one
of the prizes. Then came the Incident
which perhaps cost him his nomination.
In seconding the nomination of Charles
A. Low Wallace Bradford made an im
passioned speech calling upon the ma
jority to stand by the decision of the
caucus. This aroused the ire of the gal
leries and created bitterness upon the
floor. Nothing deterred by the demon
stration Bradford went from district to
district urging the caucus delegates to
stand firm. When he reached the dele
gation of the Thirty-eighth District he
addressed A. W. â¢ Liechti, the chairman.
Liechti did not wish to discuss the matter
and shoved Bradford to one side. Brad
ford slipped and fell and as he was going
down Morris Itiordan aimed a vicious
blow at him. Fortunately he did not
strike and Bradford walked coolly away.
The incident cost Graham his nomination.
One of his seconds withdrew and balloting
began. The four caucus candidates were
nominated.
The report of the committee on Super
visors was then adopted and eighteen
men were chosen. With their selection
began a thinly disguised effort of the
minority to throw discredit upon the la
bors of the convention. The leader in this
episode was A. Ruef, who was persistent
in a series of interruptions aimed at the
candidates of the convention. Ruef de
; manded for example that the Supervisors
!be pledged not to vote for Phelan for
; Mayor. There was â¢ absolutely no occa
sion for this suggestion and a sneer was
! the only reply to his motion. From that
moment to the end of the session Ruef
was in persistent evidence, gaining noth
ing and expecting nothing from his
efforts.
The last nomination of the night was
that of Horace Davis for Mayor. While
nominations were in order J. F. English
of the Thirty-third District moved at the
conclusion of a long speech that the can
didacy of James D. Phelan be indorsed.
Knglish deposited $10 and was greeted
with Jeers. He subsequently received
back his money and a disagreeable Inci
dent was closed. The concluding signifi
cant incident of the night was an address
of acceptance delivered by Horace Davis,
who was applauded and cheered until the
i hall was a very bedlam of enthusiastic,
j excited delegates.
* Chairman Sheldon G. Kellogg called the
convention to order promptly at 8:30
o'clock, and instructed Secretary Wilson
to call the roll of the delegates. This
having been carried out. the chair stated
that the first order of business was the
nomination of a County Clerk. W. H. R.
McMartin then took the floor and placed
William A. Deane.the incumbent, In nomi
nation. In his remarks Mr. j McMartin
said the convention had not thus far
made any mistake in the selection of its
candidates. He therefore assured the
convention that Mr. Deane was in every
way worthy to take his place on the
ticket, as he was possessed of all the
qualities that would make him worthy of
the confidence of reputable Democrats.
He dwelt on the fact that Mr. Deane
polled the highest vote on the ticket at
the last election, and that he was as sure
to be elected this time if given the nomi
nation. Â»
J.K.Jones in seconding Mr. Deane
paid that the delegates were not naming a
prophecy or a guess, but a fact and a
certainty. The nominations being de
dared closed, the secretary was In
structed to cast the unanimous vote of
the convention for Mr. Deane.
Before ihe next order of business could
be taken up, Mr. Ruef arose and yaid
he would like to refer to a ruling made by
the chair or, a point of order he 'had
made at the last session of the conven
tion, that there was not a sufficient num
ber of votes In the selection of a nominee
for Public Administrator. He stated that
since that time a number of gentlemen
had come to him and fold him he was
correct in his objection, but having
looked Into the matter he did r.ot think
it was correct, but in order to remove any
doubt, he would like to have the secre
tary cast the unanimous vote of the
convention for Captain Farnham. The
motion, coming as it did from Delegate
; Ruef. who was Mr. Farnham's chief op
i poneni on the night he was nominated,
was heartily applauded. It was put by
the chair and carried, and the secretary
was Instructed to carry out the object of
the motion, In explaining his own posi
tion Chairman Kellogg said: "I am glad
this motion was made, as it will remove
all doubt, and covers any possible objec
tion that might be made to the proceed
ing. The next order of business will be
the nomination of a candidate for
-Sheriff."
J. G. Boyne secured the floor and said:
"The gentleman 1 wish to place In nomi
nation for that high and important office
of. Sheriff of this , municipality, is well
known to* you all. He has served on the
Board of Supervisors of this city and
county for two terms, and who If you see
fit to nominate will add strength to this
ticket and will surely be a winner. He
has been identified with the business in
terests of this city for many years, and
I therefore take pleasure in placing be
fore you for your consideration the name
of John Lackmann." Dawson Mayer said
that he took great pleasure in seconding
the nomination of Mr. I^ckmnnn. In do
ing so he voiced the sentiments of the
i Democrats and Republicans of this city.

BOGUS BILL
RAN LIKE A
BAD DOLLAR
His Showing Ascribed to Sick
i ess â New Moon Again
a Surprise.
A whole raft of good currency wont in
on Bogus Bill, the fast Cyclone colt, to*
â¢win the last racing recital on the pro
gramme at Oakland yesterday. He proved
a bitter disappointment, for after getting
none the best of the send-off Bill was
never a factor In the running. In exten
uation of his poor showing his owner said
the colt contracted a cold, which placed
him on the ailing list, and this probably
accounted for bis Indifferent performance.
The winner turned up in Rixford, the
pigmy son of Brutus, which blew In with
a gentle summer zephyr, heating Constel
â lator out a neck. The close corporation
handlcappers figured the winner well up,
â still his odds staggered back from 8 to 15
to 1. Bogus Bill received such steady and
continuous backing that 4 to 5 was ob
tainable only through extreme courtesy
at post time. Bathos, after racing out
in the lead with Bamboulia, lasted out
long enough to take the miniature end of
the purse.
The weather was thick and hazy, yet all
but two favorites escaped any asthmatic
â¢affections. Seven bookmakers cut In
.again, rinding the crowd and business
quite as large as usual.

arrived home from the north last Satur
day. He "aid that the Alaska Explora

men employed by that company and
therefore had a *rood chance to know how
they were doing. Mr. Libhy's story dif-
Ois materially from thai of other "fath

"I was in that country In I^o6-67," said
Mr. LJbby, "on tlie telegraph construc

there was much gold ther^ and meant to

cumstances prevented. The Klondike

Emma Hansen Had a Close Call.
Through the prompt attendance of the
resident physician at the City and County
Hospital Emma Hansen, aped zo years,
will live to tell her experience in inhaling
an overdose of illuminating gas. The
young woman was found at 6 o'clock yes
terday morning In an unconscious condi-
V 01 1'" nPr bed at the residence of Mrs.
.1. Goldson at 4n Laurel avenue. The
strong .smell of escaping gas attracted the
attention of the early risers in vie house,
and on Investigating it ie source from Avhieh
it came they discovered that it was in
Kmma s room. An examination of the gas
jet showed that Kmma must have turned
it on, either purposely to end her earthly'
troubles or through carelessness. The i
young woman was instantly removed to j
the hospital, where restoratives were ap- i
plied, and her life was saved.
Wh.-n Been last night she positively de- !
clnied to # give any explanation as to why
she turned on the pas, or, in fact, to say !
whether it was done purposely or acci
dentally. Miss Hansen has been in the i
city about eighteen months, and those
who Know her know of no reason why she
should decide to make the iourney across
the dark river by the gas route.

COMMODORE M'CALLA
FAVORS THE BIG CANAL
Says That a Nicaraguan Waterway Is
Necessary to Save Expense in
Mobilization of War
ship.
Since the construction of a ranal
through Nicaragua waa projected the
local Chamber of Commerce has availed
Itself <>f every opportunity t<> demon
strate its necessity, its K'-rieral benefit to
the Government at iarK>-. and to the
Pacific Coast in particular. In order to
ill.;;, in further data to this end the
president r.f the chamber addressed a
letter to Commodore H. H. McCalla,
commanding the I'nited State? cruiser
Newark, which recently arrived from the
East via Cape Horn. Wednesday a letter
was received from the commodore In
which he answered the Inquiry by giv
ing these facts: Between New York and
San Francisco the Newark steamed 16,086
miles, departing from the straight course
by visiting a number of ports. Had she
been able to go through tin- proposed
canal the ravigable disiance saved would
have been 8070 miles. The coal consumed
amounted to 41^7 tons, and the estimated
saving in fuel by the canal route would
have been 2418 tons, and the value of the
coal thus saved, at the ra-tes charged at
South American ports would have
amounted to $23,899 10. After discussing
other features of the difference between
routes the commodore writes:
I beg leave to add that from a military point
of view the possibility ol" reinforcing the fleet
in the Pacific or Atlantic by units from one or
the other ia of the Kreatest importance, and as
the canal would enable us to more quickly re
inforce the Pacific or Atlantic fleet, such a
waterway would enable us to rest satisfied
w Itfa a Bmaller navy than would be required
without a canal, because the forces would be
Within closer supporting distance of each other
than if they had to pass through the Struits
of Magellan, The value to the I'nited States
of such a canal as the one proposed across N'lc
aragua cannot be estimated in dollars, because
tlie absence of BUch a means of communication
may easily mean deteat with sad and humili
ating consequences; instead of victory and the
end of the war, due to the rapid concentration
possible through such a waterway.
Mil the ground alone of sound naval policy
the canal should already have been in opera
tion, and before national interests, those of cor
porations, perhaps largely Imaginative, are In
significant. To point the moral: We must
consider the length of time which the bat
tleship Oregon was compelled to take In rein
forcing the Atlantic fleet in IS9B. We must also
realize the undoubted and very great advantage
which the Suez canal affords to Great Britain
in her communication with her Indian empire;
and the Increased strength which Germany
possesses in being able to unite her Baltic and
North Sea fleets In eighteen hours by means
of the maritime canal through the Schleswlg-
Holstein peninsula.

LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct. 5.-The $10,000
Transylvania to-day, which attracted the
attention of horsemen all over the conti
nent and in which it seemed a moral cer
tainty that Peter the Great could not be
beaten, was one of the greatest surprises
ever witnessed in Kentucky. After a ter
rific battle in which fortune was in Pe
ter's favor up to the third heat, which
he lost by a break within 160 yards of the
wire. Lord Vincent won the great stake
by sheer pluck and unexpected bottom.
At 1:20 the candidates were on the track,
for the first heat for the Transylvania
was the first race called. They were sent
on the fourtn score, With Charlie Herr in
the lead. ".Look at Peter," murmured the
crowd â â '-â â - he took the lead on in.- first
turn. At the quarter Peter still led, with
Charlie. Herr half a length away and Hal
lie Rocket third.. It was the same at the
half, with Peter a length ahead. Up to
the far turn liter was leaning back in
Ins sulky restraining his horse. They
came to the three-quarters in the same
fashion ana began unving through rhe
sux-tch. "Peter the Great!" yelled the
crowu, and coining easily he won by a
leiigtii iroih cnarne tierr, whose driver
hau ii-iii ins whip from the nalt-poie.
"It's ail over!" said cne plungers, Dreak-
Ing for the betting shed to nt-dge. Peter
now sold tor iin> and the Mela brougnt
but ten. Iney were again oft for the sec
ond heat. Tit- -i- wanted, to make a run
away race of it and was a lengtn in front
of charne Hen at the lirst turn. They
passed tne quarter in :32>j in this order,
with Halve KocKet third. In 1:03% they
reached the half, with Cnarlie at .Peter s
saddle At the three-quarters Peter was
still leading and Charlie fclerr gamely
hanging on, his driver whipping. Under
the string they went in the same order,
Peter winning by a length from Charlie
and Kingmond third.
Betting did not change for the third
heat but there were few takers for the
field. Peter began his old race when they
were sent away the third time. At the
quarter he led Charlie Herr, who was a
length in front of Kingmond. Past the
quarter Herr began to move up and, neck
and neck with Peter, passed the half in
1:03% Around the far turn Peter in
creased his lead and turned in the stretch
a length In front. A hundred and fifty
yards from the stand it looked easy for
Peter He broke passing the distance pole
and Kingmond pushed ahead, coming like
a lone on the outside, and took the
heat, with Herr second and Peter third In
2:09 flat. â¢
The betting shifted to 50 for Peter and
65 for the Held. Kingmond was away first,
with Peter second, in the fourth heat,
and Ilerr close up. Before reaching the
quarter Kingmond and Herr left their
feet and Peter went on two lengths before
Lord Vincent. Peter led four lengths at
the quarter, and it looked ail over. Vin
cent was second and Herr third. Bunched
but in the same order they came in the
stretch. Peter again broke half way down
and Vincent came on even terms. The
spectators were on their fieet yelling as
they passed under the wire. Peter's head
was six inches in front, but he had run
in the break. The heat went to Vincent,
Herr third.
Peter sold $60, field $100 for the next
heat. The favorite was done for. how
ever being tired out. Herr and Peter
fought to the head of the stretch. Here
Tudor Chimes and Kingmond joined in.
Vincent had left his feet at the half and
was out of it. â  -
Peter might have staggered home first,
but broke at the distance pole and fin
ished fifth. Kingmond took the heat,
with Tudor Chimes second and Herr
In the sixth heat Vincent, Herr and Pe
ter were up. The field sold for $50, Peter
$25 Non-winners were sent to the barn.
Off to a good start Kingmond led to the
quarter, then broke. Peter took the lead
by two lengths, but tired and was passed
by Vincent and Kingmond, the winner
finishing pulled up.
Vincent sold for ISO and the field for
$25 for the last heat. They were sent
away with Vincent in the lead. Peter waa
too "tired to keep the pace and the finish
was a procession, with Vincent, King
mond and Peter finishing as named.
The betting on the Transylvania was
sensational. Two of the largest pools
ever sold on trotting races was auctioned
off. The first was just after the third
heat, when Kingmond and Peter the
Great trotted a head finish. Andy Welsh,
the well-known bookmaker, bet Thomas
"W. Lawson of Boston $6000 to $5000 that
Peter would not win. After the fourth
heat Welsh bet Lawson $10,000 to $5000,
again taking the field. Mr. Lawson's
losses were conservatively estimated at

J. G. Boyna again took the floor and
named Charles A. Low for a position on
The ticket. In seconding .Judge Low Wal
lace Bradford won the enmity of the
lobby by his biting words of ensure
They were aimed at the delegates who
had shown a willingness to break their

a view to whipping them Into line. He

Delegate Currie arose to a point of or

!iÂ« â  '-, Ml "- Bradford tried to continue
his onslaught, but Abo Ruef sprung up
?wif UIK i th V r ? oint of - order - He said Mr.
Bradford had no right to spoil the
chances of any candidate by offending
man 1Â» the convention. Bradford
then asked if he had not the right to tell
th% convention why he arose lo second
the nomination of Judge Low, but the

?hl ym?*' a Â° d .^en Arnold W. Uechtl of
,\* }?l ,- c^ hth District took the floor
and added his meed of praise to what
had already been said of Judge Graham.
Ho was also Interrupted by a point of
order from Delegate Sargent, but Llechti
icfused to pause, and the lobby was with
him with its roar of approbation. At last
tne chairman heard wnat Attorney Sar
{fÂ°int,Jlaid, and ruled against him. The
delegate from the Thirty-eighth District
continued his speech and was loudly
, cheered for his expressions of good opin
ion for Graham. Thomas K.>rr arose to
second the nomination of Judge Low, but
was unkindly received by the gallery
Dawson Mayer followed by placing
Judge. Joachimsen in nomination. The
speech was a strong one. but did not
raise much enthusiasm, as the crowd was
Graham first, last and all the time. Abe
Kuer said that the Republicans of the
Forty-fourth District Indorsed Thomas P.
Graham, and also made an appeal for
votes for the candidate. William MoNa
mara seconded Graham and said he had
seventeen votes for him. Max Goldberg
regretted that no one seconded Judge
Joachimsen, and ha took that duty on
1 himself.
At the conclusion of his remarks nomi
. nations were closed, and Wallace Brad
ford moved that each delegation arise
. when Its vote was recorded. This was
carried. A short recess was then called
while tne chairman in each delegation
.canvassed a vote. Wallace Bradford un
wisely entered the lines of the enemy and
. ereau.d a. stampede. He went over to the
Thirty-. District delegates and tried
to remonstrate with them for in
dorsing Graham, which was contrary to
tho promise they made to the caucus
when they were taken in. Chairman
; Lic-ohti roughly pushed Mr. Bradford
away, ar.d the latter tripped over some
chairs and fell to the. floor. As he arose
Morris Riordan. another member of the
delegation, tried to hit him, but the ser
peant-at-arms prevented a light. Mr.
Bradford then walked coolly back to his
f^t. and when the meeting was again
called to order J. K. Jones, who had sec
onded the nomination of Judge Graham,
hotly withdrew his second. In view of the
disgraceful attack on a fellow member.
A vote was then taken, and while the
eecrctaries were counting them the next
order of business, the nomination of a
Superior Judge to fill the unexpired term,
was called. Delegate Haynes. a member
of the committee to mine into the
candidates for the position, moved that
the matter be referred to a committee on
vacancies. â¢ This was carried.
CJmrles L. Field, chairman of the com
mittee- on Supervisors, then arose and
placed the namos of eighteen well-known
citizens in nomination for Supervisors.
He said no eulogy was necessary at his
hands: that if the convention nominated
thc-m it would confer a favor which would
be ratified at the polls by the people of
this city. H. D. Byrne seconded the nom
inations and moved that they close. The
motion was carried, but not" until Attor
ney Riiof had voiced the statement that
tho members of the Forty-fourth District
aid not care to vote for the whole list.
He asked to have it called separately.
This created some noise and more debate,
but in the end Ruef withdrew his request,
and the original motion was adopted.
When nominations for Mayor were
called I* L. Solomons took tne "platform.
Delegate Metzner of the Thirty-fifth Dis
trict called for three cheers for the
attorney, and after they were given
the gallery gods interrupted proceedings
for five minutes by calling for cheers for
everybody. When order was secured Mr.
Solomons â  aid:
The campaign about to be inaugurated Is in
many respects a novel one. For thÂ« first time
in the political history of San Francisco the
assertion baÃ emanated from men who call
themselves Rood Republican! that because a
I'emocraUc official has proved hiinsr-if a faith
ful public servant for two terms It would be a
political crime for a Republican convention to
oppos? his third term candidacy. The sugges
tion has even gone forth that thli convention
t-hould indorse the rÂ»est Democrat, thereby
giving public testimony of the fact that honest;
and ability are unknown quantities in the Ke
liiblican party. Whatever may be the condi
tion of our political opponent? in that regard,
the Republican party confesses to no such pau
perism. . ;
The spectacle of a good Democratic Mayor
tnay be and no doubt is bo remarkable as to
exalte universal admiration, but it is- a car
dinal principle of our political faith that no
rr.an is to be 'eulogized for d Ins his simple
duty. The Republican party refuses to wor

Three hearty cheers greeted Mr. Solo
mons un the close of his eloquent speech.
A delegate from the Twenty-eighth As
sembly District seconded the nomination
and toid what a good friend Mr. Davis
was to the workingâ¢ en and what a Bplen

J. F. English of the Thirty-third Aa-
Bembly District was next recognized, and
after depositing Ho with the secretary
1 surprised the whole convention by asking-
St to Indorse James D. Phelan. The howl
rotest that arose from the vast aa
lage nearly raised the roof. The re-
I was not treated seriously by the
l< legates, and Abe Ruef ugain secured
or to add his praise to what had
bean said. He prophesied the election of
: -Mr. Davis and said he would get out and
work hard to bring about the n suit. He
appeai>-d to the delegates to do likewise.
Cheers were given for the speaker when
he finished. William Metzner also said
nice things about the Republican leader,
and when he concluded Attorney Percy
V. Long arose to a.sk whefher Mr. English
had deposited $10 with the secretary, ajid
on. being informed that he had asked that
it be returned to him and he made a mo
tion to that effect. Needless to say, it
was unanimously carried.
The chairman then announced the vote
for Police Judges. He Bald 259 5-7 dele
grates voted and that 130 votes were re
quired to secure a nomination. Graham

The last four gentlemen were chosen the
r... mimes of the convention by a unani
mous cast by the secretary of the con
vention.
When the County Committee fight came
on the minority delegates, under the lead
ership of A. Ruef, rallied for a demon
stration.
Delegate Adrian Smith of the majority
moved that the committee consist of
ninety members, four from each Assem
bly District and eighteen at large, and
that the chair appoint the committee
Mr. Smith moved also that the chair be
Instructed to consult with the chairmen
of delegations in making his selection.
Delegate Ruef raised object ion to the
motion on the ground that the law did not
authorize selection of a county committee
In such manner as Mr. Smith's proposition
contemplated. He contended further that
delegates were officers under the primary
election law and could not delegnto their
era to the chairman. He rais.-.i a
point of order against Smith's motion.
Chairman Kellogg ruled that the con
ventlon had power under the law to ap
point a county committee in the ma
mplated by the motion oi Delegate
Smith.
Mr. Ruef gave notice in a friendly spirit
that he might seek from the courts an In
terpretation of the law.
Smith spoke at length in sup
! the motion. The tone of his speech
rsuasive and conciliatory.
Mr. Ruef acknowledged the courtesy of
the remarks by Mr. Smith, but he r- a
. Li? objection tc the plan on the
ground that ii placed the p>>\\ir in uw
man's hand, and that such power might

Legates should not be driven out >r
the party and converted into Aguinaldos.
Ruef was asked by an Inquisitive delq
why he did not mak-- that -

At this point Ruef was interrupted and
Horace Davis was escorted to the stage.
When the committee escorting him en

cheered to the echo. The cheering wa?

Ciiizen Republicans Refuse to Obey

Tom O'Brien's Citizens' Republican
party nominated a few candidates last
evening: at Pioneer Hall, adopted a plat

It will take another whack at ticket
making: this evening and Mr. O'Brien
promises to have the harness so arranged
that the delegates will be unable to take
the bit in their mouths and get away from
him.
The nominations mnile last evening be

Thomas H. Morris; County clerk, Peter
Hammond; Police Judges, Edward M.

Joseph E. I^je, who parts his hair in

thing went alonK nicely. The sami I â

County Clerk, Peter Hammond. Edward
M. Sweeney and Judge Treadweli were
named for Police judges before the
trouble broke out in earnest. Despite the
re? jlntlpn O'Brien tried to force the issue
and stirred up a political hornet's nest
Jud^e Joachimsen was placed in nor
n by one of O'Briens men and the
ringmaster himself followed with the
nomination of Judge Charles Conlan. An
obstreperous delegate protested with
vigor against a Republican convention
swallowing a Democrat, claiming 1 that
there were enough of their own kind will-
Ing and anxious to fill every office for
which nominations would be martp.
Turmoil followed and in the midst of it
all there was a motion to adjourn. Chair
man lA'f. refused to entertain the idea of
quitting. He, said that a motion to ad

it was out of ordy, and that this was one
â  if the occasions when it was out of place.
Roll call was demanded and finally things
grew so boisterous that the chairman wa*
â  I to yield. The lobby and all voted
as the secretary called the names of the
delegates, and when the task was- com
pleted the tally sheets showed that
O'Brien had lost control of his own con
vention by a vote of more than three to
one.
Ju<lko Conlan states that the use of his
name before the convention was entirely
unauthorised and done for the purpose of
injuring him before the Democratic con
vention to-night.
M'NAB'S CONVENTION
CALLED TO ACCOUNT
Organized Labor Threatens to Bolt
the Democratic
Ticket.
Labor unions of this city are at war
with Gavin McNab and his Democratic
convention and are so incensed at â  the
treatment they have received that they
have demanded recognition in the fol
lowing open letter, signed by their re
spective representatives:
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: We, the
undersigned representative* of the respec
tive labor organizations, do earnestly pro
test against the manner In which we have
been treated by the chairman of tin.- "Dem
ocratic munclpal convention" In regard to
a petition forwarded to him, soliciting that
the same be placed In the platform in th"
interest of labor. The request we deemed
Just and equitable to the lab - a masses ,
of the city, both "men and women. T)iq
petition was based on a bill known as
"Senate bill 457," and which passed both
bouses of the Legislature at its last ses
sion, which bill, if signed by the Governor
would have relieved the toiling masses
from an enormous expense and burden, but
unfortunately we met with the same rebuff
and rebuke at the bands of the Democratic
convention as we did at the hands of the
chief executive of the State.
What was the use or the benefit to the
people to destroy those devils known a3
bosses when it Is plain to be seen by in
telligent people, according to the actions
of the convention, that they are abject
â  slaves and suppliant tools obeying the dic
tates and commands of even a worse and
more cunning boss than those that were
destroyed by the people, namely: Gavin
MoNab. .
The reason for the high-handed manner
In which this Czar this tyrannical politi
cal boss, subjects the majority of the con
vention, you may say under whip and lash,
can only be attributed In our minds to the
fact that he has become intoxicated and
delirious over the popularity of the Hon.
James D. Phelan, believing that his name
will carry the ticket through; and is of
the opinion that he can foist on the people
such men as he may deem proper to name,
and that the voter is so gullible that on
the day of the general election he or they
will swaliow the whole potion.
We desire to state that since the advent of
the Hon. James D. Phelan into the political
arena we have been his warm and earnest
supporters, and without egotism we can say
we have done more to elevate him than all
the "McNabs" that ever left the Highlands
of Scotland.
To show our gratitude for one who proved
himself to be a fearless and courageous ad
vocate of labor by his untiring efforts in its
behalf, we do not ask but we demand that
the Hon. R. Porter Ashe receive at the hand
of the convention the nomination for the
office of District Attorney, believing that he
is the most available candidate for the
office, being a man of marked ability, pos
sessed of all the qualifications necessary to
fill the position, and one against whose in
tegrity no man can say aught, and further
that he is the most popular man known to
all the labor organizations of viÂ« city. His
name placed on the ticket will bring
strength to It and carry the ticket to a
successful issue. In conclusion we desire to
state that, representing fifteen thousand
votes, our demand is worthy of considera
tion and certainly of recognition. Should It
not receive cognizance the only Inference
that can be drawn Is that labor Is a nonen
tity and not worthy of any recognition, and
this will force us to act as the Merchant of
Venice.
Were it not for the support given by our
Independent lab organizations we "know
that the complexion of the convention would
have been widely different. Respectfully,
t E -t, R - os fv J TT Davls: . Charles Wright," J.
L. Purrell, H. Howard, James D. Parnell,
J. F. Sohlomer.

SQUAWS FIGHT FOR FORTUNE.
Lucy Hite's Suit for Divorce on Trial
The hearing of the divorce suit of Lucy
Illte, the Indian woman who claims to
be John R. Kite's wife, was opened yes
terday in the offices of Rodgers, Paterson
& Slack in the Nevada block, when the
taking of depositions from the principals
in the suit was begun.
The plaintiff, who is a full-blooded In
dian woman, claims that she is entitled
to a portion of the vast estate of the
Mariposa mliionalre, who has since mar
ried another woman. Should Judge Jones
decide that the Indian wedding said to
have been performed for the couple is
legal, it wili invalidate the marriage of
Hite to Mrs. Cecelia Nougues, which took
place in Oakland two years ago.
Judge J. P. Jones of Mariposa County
ordered the case to be opened, he having
come to this city with his stenographer
for that purpose. W. \V. Foote and F 1 J
Castleton represented the defendant and
Van H. Paterson and Charles P. Hanlon
the plaintiff.
Lucy Hite, as she is commonly called
was put on the stand and told of havi-ig
gone to live with Hite after an illness
through which she had nursed him She
finally left him lierruise of his unfaithful
bui returned to him at Elite's Cove
after he had promised to mend his wars
she related how Hit- had put his arms
id n< r to be married and said t.. her
in Digger Indian, "Toi na me oha," which
means, "I marry you."
Attorney Foote wanted this stricken
out, but the court overruled him. saying
however, that 11 was 'i-uii.tful whether
the Indian marriage, if such it was is
v;iiid iii !:t\v.
The woman then pwore that Hite had
!â 'â  Rented her to Mrs. Thomas Jenkins
rles A. Phillips, Mrs. C. \ Vischer
Ji Steams, Archie Leonard, Mrs Perry
Holland, Mrs. Mary Grosjean, Luther
Dave and James Grove, Sam WeADha 1
Mrs. W. H. White. Billy Sims and a great
many others as his wife, and that sh-Â»
was commonly known to them as Mrs
Hite. She said that Hite had given cattie
to her son Tommy and provided for his
schooling. She had always had a i ood
. home, which her millionaire husband had
kept up,
Tommy Hite, son of thp witness, was
present in the room, but will not be made
to testify until later. He. is an unsightly
cripple.
John Hite, the defendant, will be put on
the stand to-day.

THREE HUNDRED
FIRMS TO HOLD
MASS MEETING
Important Conference
To-Day.
A meeting of gTeat Importance to the
business men of the city will be held this
[ afternoon at 2 o'clock in the rooms of the ,
San Francisco Board of Trade. All the j
wholesalers and jobbers of the city have
been invited to attend. The purpose of
the meeting is to complete the organiza-
J tion of the merchants in opposition to
the Eastern jobbers who are seeking to
get the trade of the coast.
What the St. Louis Freight Bureau pe
titioned the Interstate Commerce Com
missioners to do is thus enumerated: To
abolish the present difference between j
carload and less than carload rates and
I commodity rates; to fix a difference be
tween carload and less than carload
rates; to grade the rates between Chi
cago and St. Louis and between St. Louis
I and San Francisco.
The effect of granting the laÃt named
j request would be to make the rates
higher to San Francisco than to any other
! point east of San Francisco. The Job
bers and wholesalers of this city believe
that this move would destroy the jobbing
business of the coast.
The argument of the Pacific Coast
wholesalers and jobbers is that the estab
lishment of graded rates would entirely
neutralize the advantages that belong to
geographical position. Railroads must j
recognize the competition of vessels, and -
all the transcontinental roads have here- â 
tofore recognized such competition and I
have given their termini on the Pacific j
lower rates than to intermediate points.
H rates are graded to St. Louis or St.
Paul or Chicago they must be graded to
towns and cities farther West, and it
I would be possible for the merchants of j
I the mountain cities of Butte, Helena and
Grant Falls, for Instance, to solicit and
secure business in the seaports of the
north; and the same conditions would ap
ply to Intermediate towns east of San
Francisco.
If rates were graded westbound, they
pay. they must naturally be graded east
bound also. Chicago would get a better
graded rate than New York; St. Louis
a better rate than Chicago; the Atlantic
const manufacturers and merchants
would be shut out from the business of
the Pacific Coast, in the interest of St.
Louis and Chicago, and the advantage
which the Pacific Coast terminals have
always enjoyed by reason of having
transcontinental rates based on the fact
of sea competition would be lost. To
grade rate? from Middle West jobbing
points would expose the Pacific Coast Job
brr to an unnatural competition. If St.
Louis should be given a lower rate on
business consigned to Pacific Coast termi
nals than New York, then the cities far
ther West would be entitled to still lower
rates on Pacific Coast business than St.
Louis.
About 300 firms have been Invited to be I
represented at the meeting this afternoon, i
which will be one of the largest gather-
Ings of wholesalers and jobbers held in
this city in many years.
Station D Will Not Move.
Station D of the postal service at the
foot of Market street will not he dis
turbed in the rearrangement of the space
In and around the ferry station. Wells-
Fargo's location will be changed. The
postal station will eret all the space and
mmodatlon that it r.eods. The ox
press company will he provided with a
new building and will also have all tha
accommodation that ip necessary.
S..ni<> days atr<> there was some fear
that station I> would be forced to re
move by reason of the intprruption of Us
business due to the passage of the ex
press company's anri many other teams
across the postal fiel<l territory in the
bat k nf tlie ferry station. Since then there
have been repeated conferences. The
Harbor Commissioners were visited by
Postal Inspectors Munro and Erwin. The
express people were also consulted. There
was no place in the ferry station unoc
cupied that seemed to he adapted to the
uses of either th<- express company or of
station D. A proposition was made to
move station D farther south and tako
up a part of the downstairs waiting room.
This was considered unsatisfactory be
cause the express company's teams would
still be a source of .-ontinual interruption
to the dispatching of mails.
Finally the plan lias been hit upon of
removing the express company entirely
fr<>m the ferry station and providing room
and new buildings south of the ferry sta
tion. There is ample wharf room at that
point and buildings can be provided that
will serve the express company even bet
ter than the quarters now occupied.

English Hop Crop Damaged.
The National Association of English Hop
Growers, under date of September 11, has is
sued the following circular:
The Council last year issued a circular to
growers, in which certain advice was tendered
that proved very beneficial to sellers at Wor
cester Fair and subsequently.
At a large and representative meeting of the I
Council held here to-day the general questions
of the crop and market were considered, and I
although it was found that hops had thus far 1
come down in most districts ol excellent qua!- ;
lty and up to expectation as to quantity, the j
recent and rapid spread of red mold on the I
thin lands and vermin on the deep lands is |
60 seriously affecting the ungathered crop as |
to render it impossible for a larger supply of j
choice hops to be marketed than was the case j
last year. From these facts, added to the
lark of labor in several districts It appears
to be not improbable that a large area will
he left unpicked, and that consequently an
important reduction from previous estimates of
the total yield of tne English crop must be
brought about.
Recent reliable Information from America j
confirm previous reports and it is now ad
mitted that in New York Slate the crop will
be 20 to 25 per cent less than last year, and
that the quality being affected by mold and
vermin will be more or less inferior. There
fore, though the yield of the Pacific Coast may
be in ex.-vrrs of that of 189S, the total American
output will only leave a moderate surplus for
exportation. In Oregon and Washington there
Is a recent increase of lice, which may yet
lower the estimated figures for these States.

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 6.â The stock market con- i
tinued to snow marked Indifference to the dis
turbances In fr reign markets on account of war
senre and of money difficulties as well as to
the continued stiffness of the local money rate.
Prices dipped at the opening: on the rumor of
an invasion of Natal by the Boor forces and
on the further advance in the Hank of Eng
land's official rate of discount. But the open
ing prices were for the most part the lowest
and the market quite promptly set about re
trieving its decline. The liquidation for Lon
don account was comparatively small in vol
ume, sales not exceeding; 13,000 shares. In fact,
the foreign stock markets m â  Hi- ! to take no
very serious account of the strained condition
of tain and even the Kaffir mining stocks,
which would be most vitally affected by the
war, were quite firm.
The market for call money In New York
showed further, relief from the extreme strin
gency. To-day's maximum rate wan 13 per ,
cent, and It fell before the close below the legal
rate. â¢ - . .
The undertone of the market was very firm.
This was iot due to any largÂ«s demand, even
in the case of stock which moved quite widely,
but rather to the bidding up of prices by those
Interested In seeing a higher figure for their
holding*. This bidding up process, however,
failed to bring out large offerings, which fact
was significant of the market's llrmnes?. An
other was the large number of stocks now
usually dealt in. which were brought into ac
tivay. The latter feature la always indicative !
of the presence- of the bargain hunter who Is
buying stocks outright to hold at an invest
ment, a class of buyers who do not depend on
the mom-y market for borrowed funds. There
Is undoubtedly a growth of confidence that the
rtringency for money is over. The demand
from the Interior for funds continues large and
may encroach on the reserve of interior banks
loaned to-day on call in New York. The rising
discount rat* in London caused an additional
advance in the rate for sterling exchange here,
in Paria arid In Berlin, and the weak return of
the Bank of Fran discourages the Idea that
either London cr New fork can hope for large
relief from that center.
Tin* bond market win Cull in sympathy with
etocks. Total ral^, par value, $1, 275.000.
Unit' States twos declined -.. new fours, Vi
and the threes and fives a the bid price.

London Market. "
NEW YORK, Oct. The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
! The advance In the bank rate to 5 per cent 1
'< caused little surprise on the Stock Exchange
1 here to-day, owing to the high rate yesterday.
Bank of England returns show that the re
: serve has been reduced Â£250,000, pulling down j
the ratio of reserve liabilities to 25 per cent. [
' That was due partly to the demand for money |
i at the turn of the quarter year, but Â£250.000 |
worth of gold is expected to be sent to the ;
i Cape to-morrow.
The market was erratic. An invasion or
Natal by the Boers was reported, but that
proved to be a signal for free buying of Afrl
i cans The large capitalists steadied all de
partments. The present Interval of peace is
regarded only as a postponement of war. The
rise In the bank rate had little effect. Bears
were active in closing accounts.
' Consols opened at l r '2"i and went to 103%.
i then relapsed to 103. On the rise in the bank
I rat.> they closed at 103%. Americans opened at

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Oct. 5.-Wheat at the opening was
firm and nervously active, with the price over
calif. The Initial price for December was 73Â»i
Â®73% c, v* over yesterday*! close. Liverpool,
the Index of the war situation, failed to hold
early cains, however, and the price slid off
later under calls to December 7" : Â\ with the
market less active. Karly buyers were sellers
on the decline. The tendency to liquidate was
checked In a degree by the smaller receipts at
primary points, and the growing belief that
winter wheat supplies are becoming exhausted
Clearances were lar^-e, this fact cxertlnK an
influence which later advanced the price of
December to 73V&C, at which figure It closed.
May wheat opened at 76%@76%c, and closed at
76%@7â¬%c. The market was at times quite
rervous over a. comparatively, narrow range.
The sharp advance at Liverpool and the sud
den reaction In that market indicated a feel-,
ing of uncertainty in the minds of English
traders over the Transvaal situation that made
local shorts uneasy and caused considerable
buying by that class of traders. The demand
from this source was a factor in the late
fctrength of the market.
Trading in corn was dull. The market in
general was steady in sympathy with wheat.
Big seaboard engagements had some influ
ence. December closed unchanged at 20% C.
Oatr were quiet and unchanged, influenced
j by wheat. There was a large cash demand for
May at 24Vic. December closed a shade lower
at Z2Tsc.
Provisions were rather heavy and the close
â was at a slisht decline. January pork closed
2%c lower at $9 72% ; January lard" J%oÂ§c lower,

Chicago opened firmer on better foreign ad- i
vices and war news, which gave the market ;
a nervous undertone, but the feeling became ;
weaker on small business and a disposition on j
the port of dealers to Ignore war cables, which ;
have generally ended in smoke thus far. Liv
erpool was VI higher, and cargoes were strong ;
on the London market. Consols were %d lower, i
and the Hank of England advanced Its rate
of discount to 6 per cent. Rumors of hostili- ;
ties were not confirmed. Chicago dealers fought
the advance, but New York continued strong,
foreign acceptances were liberal and there was i
very little Wheat offering, though thirty-seven
loads were taken for export. A weaker Liver
pool closing caused a decline and dealers were
very bearish and short.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call -
903 Broadway. Oct. 5.
In view of the campaign which will be
waged a year hence over the adoption of
constitutional amendment 6, introduced '
in the last Legislature by Assemblyman j
McDonald, the foregoing resolution,
adopted at to-day's session of the nine- i
teenth annual conference of the Central :
Baptist Association of California, Is of
deep significance. The association is j
made up of the clergy of the Baptist |
churches In San Francisco, Alameda, â 
Marln, Contra Costa and Sola.no counties, j
and through it the resolution quoted goes
on record as opposed to the proposed con- ;
stitutional amendment.
To-day's action was not -without some I
opposition, for fifty delegates refused to i
vote either way, while there was but a \
majority of six to carry the resolution.
But this was wholly due to some mis- ;
understanding. There were three propo- i
sitions before the association, and in the j
confusion incident to the discussion some i
of the members lost sight of what propo- i
sition was being put first. This is given I
as the reason for some of the delegates i
refusing to vote. It had been recom- '
mended In one of the propositions that I
the conference members give their active
support .0 the amendment in 1902, but In |
the confusion Dr. W. O. Baldwin of Ala- j
meda offered as a substitute the resolu- j
tion finally adopted. In explaining his j
resolution Dr. Baldwin said:.
This* country in free to alt. Ecclesiastical de- j
nominations as corporations are on a level
with other corporations, bo far as taxation of I
property Is concerned. "We would do well not
to import the ecclesiastical exemptions from i
which other Slates are now trying to rij rbrm
itelve?. We are fearful of some unscrupulous
people taking advantage of this exemption to ;
do a little speculating in the real estate mar- !
ket. Altogether too Brad) property will escape
taxation and It will do the State no bv>j<l.
Next year's conference will be held in j
Alameda. Rev. E. B. Bennett of the |
Twenty -third-avenue Baptist Church will
deliver th? annual sermon on that oc- j
casion, alternate Rev. C. S. Keetch, and !
Rev. C. H. Hobart will preach the
doctrinal sermon. The association |
treasurer reports a deficit of $20. '
Early th evening the conference ad- I
journed, and the remaining hours were j
given over to the Baptist Young People's '
Union, which elected the following officers |
for the ensuing year: President, R, 11. E. j
Espy; vice-president, Mrs. Meta E. Gaila- |
horn; secretary. Miss Ilattie Bromley;
treasurer, Mr. Rowo; managers, Henry

RIVALS IN GOLD
BRICK INDUSTRY
Gage Shares Honors With the lia=
waiian Bunko Man.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90s Broadway, Oct. 5.
/"> OVERNOR Gage has revived the
political gold br-ick industry in this |
U county. The latest recipient of
of these treasures is James P. Oliver
of Berkeley, who had been positively
promised the position of Deputy Labor
nmiseioner.
Several weeks ago his friends, who in
\ elude the most prominent Republican? in
this county, were given assurance that
I lliver would get the job. Several mem
bera of the State CentraTCommittee were '
! also assured by Mr. Gage, or posslbly
Cdlonel Burns, that Oliver would be re
warded for his work in the last campaign.
The promises given all of th.em were guld
bricks.
The disappointment of A. J. Reid, who |
had been called by the Governor to the
I 'a lace Hotel to receive the Labor Com- :
missionership, ajid who was then given
a gold brick, was as nothing compared
to the surprise and disappointment of the
friends of Mr. Oliver. In addition to the
indorsements already referred to every
Senator and Assemblyman in this county,
including the four who stood loyally by
Burns, requested the Governor to ap
point Oliver, and received assurances of
compliance.
When It was announced that Mr. Kelsey
of Santa Clara was to be the Assistant
State Labor Commissioner, Alameda
County Republicans wondered to what
end they had worked so loyally last fall
to swell the majority of Mr. Gage. In :
this instance ns in that of Mr. Reid, di- |
rect promises were given with the same i
result.
Oliver, 'luring the last two campaigns,
has gone on the stump at the suggestion
of the Republican State Central Com- j
mtttee, and made a very successful cam- !
paigner. He was promised a reward, and
the whole county united in his Indorse
tnent, only to find that Governor Gage's j
| promises are like the proverbial pie- j
crust.
I So much indignation has been expressed
lat the latest action of the Governor
toward Alnmeda County that iui assur
bas teen given that Oliver will be
taken care of, but no more faith is put
in this promise than the last. Mr. Oliver
comes from Berkeley, which district was j
misrepresented in the last Assembly by
Mr. Howard Wright. It is possible 'hat
Mr. oiivr may have at some time or
expressed his disapproval of the
manner 'n which Mr. Wright acted, an<i
that he is now being punished for his
grave indiscretion.
Oliver was one of the foremost leaders
of the movement in the Interest of Dr. ;
<; C. J" !!-!â¢â¢ for Governor. It is said that
j he had a hand in composing that cele- j
brated ode first sung at Sacramento.

dividuals selected by members of the orig
inal committee. The number of delegates

CLARENCE M. REED will not
manage a Hawaiian plantation on a
large salary and with a minimum
amount of effort. A few weeks ago
Mr. Reed, who Is a nun of the well
known attorney and Blind Insti
tute director, received overtures from
a generous Hawaiian, A. P. Stod
dard the same Mr. Btoddard that
successfully worked several guests at the
Haywards Hotel and tried to "work"
more whiÂ»n his little scheme failed.
Stoddard told Clarence that he was
looking for a manager for ;i plantation.
Reed honestly admitted thai he knew
nothing of managing plantations, but v&a
Informed thai that was no bar. 'We will
have nothing to do." said Stoddard, "ex
cept bossing some other fellows and draw
ing our princely salaries. We will ship a
few other fellows down there to do the
work. Now to business. Of course, when
we get to Honolulu, we Bhall have to put
on a certain amount of 'dog.' We nad
better have dress suits, of course we
shall have to stay at the Royal Hawaiian
Hotel for about a month and do things
up in shape. If people think we are not
well fixed they would have no use for
us. You have a dress suit? That is
good. You won'l need to buy one.
"It would be better to take a few
hundred dollars with us, as we might
need It. You have two or three hundred?
â Well that's good. And can borrow as
much more? That's better. We can go
down cheap enough on the steamer, but
once in Honolulu we must rut a dash.
Now th" thing's all right and I will
write you in a few days, Riving you all
the details."
A few days later Clarence Reed re
ceived a letter from Mr. Stoddard. It
left nothing In doubt. The plantation was
actually In existence, merely wanting a
few managers, Oaklanders preferred, and
they would go on the next steamer.
There was a little hint about money, and
the suggestion that If he, Stoddard.
should be a little short, until they had
done their "dog" at the Royal Hawaiian
Hotel, why It would be quite easy for
Reed to Iran a couple of hundred, and
they could settle when they met the
cashier it the big plantation.
"I showed the letter to my father," said
Clarence Reed to-day, "and he read it
carefully, tolling me he would think
about it and Ktve me his advice."
Five minutes later George W. Reed re
turned the letter to his son indorsed
"gold brick"â and the Incident ended.
Last week Clarence Reed saw his
bunko friend Stoddard in San Franeifco,
hut was never able to get near enough to
him to hold a conversation with him or
demand an explanation.

RESTORED MOTHER TO
HOME AND INFANT
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 5.
The police in North Oakland had an in
teresting Search last night. They were
charged with the duty of recovering a
woman, a child and a house, and of unit
ing all three.
LaJe last night the message was sent to
headquarters that a little girl was miss
ing. During the afternoon Mrs. Blum and
her young daughter went to a house she
had rented on Grace avenue, Lorin. Some
how or other the woman could not find
the house, and she left the child on the
i orner of Calais street wbile she tried to
ii*i*l tin- place she had rented. The mother
wandered off and lost hor way. A police
man saw a little girl quietly sleeping on
the grass near a Btreet corner and earned
her to the house of the nearest family,
where she was given into thg, carp Of ;i
Mrs. Simpson. It was nearly midnight
when the mother ceased hunting for her
child, and still had not found her house,
having no other direction than a faint
idea of its appearance. A co-ed, of the
university met the young mother and took
hi r to her home for the night. This morn
ing the police reunited mother and child,
and after a search found their home for
them. The officer tacked a large pencil
number on the front door before leaving,
so that the mother's forgetfulness would
not give the police department another
night's work.

HE THREATENED
HER LIFE WITH
GUN AND RAZOR
Divorce Granted to
Florence Kelly.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 5.
The unhappy matrimonial experience of
Mrs. Florence Kelly was terminated this
afternoon, when Superior Judge Greene
granted to her a divorce from James
Kelly on the grounds of willful neglect,
rxtreme cruelty and habitual intemper
ance.
The unhappy woman's story, as related
! In her complaint and in her testimony,
i teemed with cruelty and abuse dating al
| most from the time of the marriage in
May, 1885. Shortly after the nuptials the
husband, who earns a salary of $100 per
month, became addicted to the liquor
habit. On one occasion, so Mrs. Kelly's
story goes, he came home late one night
and dragged her about the house by her
I hair. Her submission to such acts ap
parently emboldened the husband, for at
I another time, she says, he threatened to
cut her throat with a razor; and in April
of 1898 he wielded a revolver, threatening
jto shoot her. But for the timely interfer-
e nce of bystanders Kelly might have
ended her life. Finally one day, Mrs.
Kelly claims, her husband sold out all
1 the household furniture and abandoned
| her and their little three-year-old child.
In granting the decree Judge Greene
I awarded the custody of the child to the
i mother and directed the husband to pay
! monthly alimony in the sum of $50.
j George E. Moenning commenced suit for
! a divorce to-duy against Emma J. Moen
ning. The complaint, prepared by Attor
ney H. C. Schaertzer, recites desertion.
Kate Lucy Myrick commenced suit to
-1 day against Robert Luther Myrick for
! $35 per month alimony pending her divorce
j suit and $250 for expenses. She asks also
i that a receiver be appointed to collect the
i rents from the homestead property.
In the divorce suit of May E. Fink
against Alonzo W. Fink, defendant, by his
I attorney, R. E. Ragland, to-day filed a
: motion to strike out from the complaint
certain paragraphs; also a demurrer to
J the Insufficiency of facts alleged.
WOULD NOT MEET
WITH THE MAYOR
CoUNCILMEN DECLINED TO DIS
CUSS BONDS.
Another Evidence That the Breach in
the City Gcvernment Is Still
Widening.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 5.
There was to have been a meeting
last night of the Council sitting
as a committee of the whole.
There was no meeting, and many
are the explanations being given for Its
failure to come off. The chief matter to
have been discussed was the bond issue.
This matter has already received some
attention from members of the Council,
has been handled In extenso by the Im
provement clubs, and there is also on rec
ord an opinion by Mayor Snow regarding
the best time at which to call the elec
tion.
The Council believes that it Is Its sole
prerogative to arrange this important
matter. Some of the members think the
Mayor Bhould have a hand in the arrange
ment: others believe he should keep his
hands off. Last night It was understood
that the Mayor would be present. In
stantly all kinds of excuses were made
why a committee meeting should not be
held. President Rowe saw plainly there
would not be a quorum, so it was decided
not to waste the time of the few who
would attend.
This attitude gives rise to the presump
tion that at some time in the near future
there will be another quiet little banquet
somewhere, at which the whole matter
will be fixed up, so that when the Council !
meets to take action on the bond question j
the expectant lobby and the curious mi- j
norlty will suddenly discover that the j
whole matter has been adjusted wKhout
their aid.

KRUTTSCHNITT
MAY REICH THE
VICE PRESIDENCY
Whispers of Promo

â¦
CLAIMS FOR RECOGNITION
â¦
RECORD THAT BRINGS NO FEEL

â¦
Train Service That Makes the South
ern Pacific a Byword for
Carelessness and
Delay.
There Is a whisper down the wind
which :,iys it is not improbable that Gen
eral Manager Kruttschnltt of the South
ern Paciflo Company, who is known to
his many admirers as "The Discrimin
ator," owing to the splendid aptitudi he
exhibits for diplomacy, may succeed
George Crocker as the second vice presi
dent of the road.
This whisper may not be confirmed
when the appointment is made by the
board of directors, yet it had enough
foundation to make it a safe bet that if
"The Discriminator" docs not gel the plum
It will be because it falls to the portion
of H. E. Huntlngton, the only man who,
In the opinion of the wise ones, ia likely
to prove a successful competitor of the
general manager.
Promotions generally go by meritâ
at least they are so supposed to so. Pol
icy may often advance a man, but it ia
seldom that a big railroad official receives
such a boost without having previously
shown some efficiency upon which those
having his career 111 hand may base bos
claims to recognition. , . ..
Now, if the directors of the Southern
i Pacino Company have determined to con
-1 fer the honors that go with the second
vice presidency on the man who is now
their general manager, it is quite proper
that he should not be allowed to hide his
light under a bushel, but that, on the
contrary, the people of the State should
be made acquainted with the splendid
service performeu by the railroad while
under his active management, so that
they may get a fair idea of the really
excellent merits of the man whom C Jt\
Huntington may pro^abiy elevate to the
second highest, dignity in the great cor
poration of which he is the head and
The following record is based on the
official reports of the road itself and on
the statistics which have been compiled
by the postal authorities since the nrst
Â°I) t vi e mg the nine months that have
passed since January, the Southern Pa
clnc has run, excepting the trains which
have now and then been doubled up with
those of the day following because they
were so late that it was useless to send
them on to their destination, 656 trains,
and of this number 301 have been late.
: These delays have been all the way from
: a couple of hours to three-fourths of a
day in duration and have been as com
mon on the southern route as on the
Â°it lias made no difference what the
month of the year, the weather, the
amount of business done or any other
condition-, the result has been just the
same. Night after night, morning after
morning tne bulletins have been forced
to chronicle the fact that the mails were
delayed as usual. â.â "-â ",. . .^
True, the regularity of accident on the
Southern Pacitic may plead as an ex
cuse in many, very many instances. But
then that excuse, good as it may be. is
hardly satisfactory. A man may kick
upon arriving at his office in the morn
ing and tinding thafhundreds of dollars
worth of business has slipped through his
lingers because the advices he depended
upon have been nearly a day late. But
the fact that his mail, when it does ar
rive is sprinkled with the blood of same
unfortunate passenger, a mute evidence
to testify to the cause of the delay, win
not cause him to exculpate the carriers
with any greater alacrity.
When asked concerning the reason of
this tardiness in the delivery of the
United States mails the Southern Pacinc
is accustomed to pass the buck up to its
connections. It is always the Lnlon a
cific or some other road that is to blame.
The trains are more than half the time
reported as on time at Ogden, yet they
continue to arrive in this city with the
same number of hours to their discredit.
Moreover it does not concern the mer
chants of this city whether the train is
one hour or ten hours late at some dis
tant eastern point of connection. All they
want is to be assured that the train ser
vice out of and into this city is run with
some degree of regularity and they will
stand for the rest.
There is a penalty in this connection
and it is scaled from the price collected
for the entire run down the line in pro
portion to the magnitude of the delay.
This is a matter which is kept absolutely
secret between the railroad officials and
the postal authorities; yet if the penalty
is properly enforced it must be a source
of some revenue to the Government. Is
it enforced?
This question of mail service has cre
ated such universal indignation among
the people of this city that it is high time
that something was done to correct it.
Mr Huntington should either impress on
Ins menials the necessity of properly ful
filling the obligations of their positions or
he should place men in authority who are
not only capable but conscientious enough
to see that the matters intrusted to their
care are properly carried out. This is an
age of the survival of the fittest and if a
man has neither the executive ability nor
the energy to make good the obligations
he assumes he should be made to give
way to some one that has. . ,-, â¢ >
Mr. Kruttschnitt has been quoted as
saying that he cannot properly be held
responsible for the carelessness and neg
lect of subordinates. This is in connec
tion with the avalanche of railroad acci
dents that has fallen upon the people of
this State. The trainmen issue a circular
stating that they are neither drunkards
nor incompetents and that they compare
favorably with the employes of any other
road in the country.
Both of these statements are interesting I
as well as Instructive, but the trainwreck
lng goes steadily on. Some one must be
to blame; there must be some official to
whom to look for a correction of such
criminal evil. Such a state of affairs
cannot exist without the responsibility
resting somewhere. Now the general
manager is the active head of the operat
ing department and if he is not personally
to blame he should see to it that those
who are be dismissed from their positions
and their places filled by men who â  will
do a little better in lessening the mortal
ity of the State and delivering the malls
and passengers with something that ap
proaches the scheduled time which is of
their own making.
Mr. Kruttschnitt may be the proper
man for the position of second vice presi
dent and he may not be. That is a matter
that will, no doubt, eventually t>e settled
by Mr. Huntington. But these are the
facts. Since the beginning of the year
only one mail out of every three has
reached this city at the hour it should,
and, aside from minor accidents, there
have been no less than seventeen serious
train wrecks on the line over which Mr.
I Kruttschnltt exerclfes supervision.

Daughter Now on Trial.
Judge Bahrs yesterday took up the ac
tion of Frederick Marks against his
daughter, Elizabeth MrPherson, brought
to compel the defendant to reconvey to
the plaintiff the family residence at 2612 Vi

"while he was Buffering from the effects of
I partial asphyxiation his daughter and a
i friend, Hairy Thompson, worked upon his
I confidence and got him to convey the
property, with tne object in view of pre
venting Dr. Schmeit from filing an attach

' Vices rendered in paving the life of the
: plaintiff after hi- had been partially as

fGOV. ROGERS OF WASHINGTON HERETO MEET HIS BOYS:
GOVERNOR J. R. ROGERS of Washington, accompanied by his official
staff and a number of prominent citizens and politicians of his State,
arrived in tho city yesterday morning so as to be present to extend a
welcome to the soldiers who have brought honor to their flag and dis
tinction to the State that sent them forth to far off Luzon to fight the
battles of their country. The party that accompanies the Governor
contains many names famous in all the prominent walks of life, but, repre
sentative as the party is. it is none too good to do honor to such soldiers as
the Washington boys have proved themselves to "be on many a hard fought
field amid the sickly glades and poisonous swamps of the tropical Islands.
Those who came with the Governor are Brigadier General E. H. Fox, ad
jutant general of the State of Washington; Colonels M. McCarty, F. J. Parker
and A. Joab, of Governor Rodgers' staff; United States Senators A. H. Foster
and George Turner; F. J. Browne, Superintendent of Public Instruction, F. L.
Ballaine, Judge Carroll of Tacoma, Levl Ankeny and a number of others who
accompany the delegation in order to seize the first opportunity to greet
friends and relatives among the returning volunteers.
When seen yesterday Governor Rotors said that, though pome plans
had been already formulated, the reception that would be accorded to the
boys would depend altogether upon their expressed wishes after they are mus
t< r< d out.
As the plans now stand the troops will be taken home free of charge, their
transportation being assured personally by Mr. Ankeny at an expense of some
thing like JIO.OOO to him individually. Mr. Ankeny is a very wealthy citizen of
Washington, and takes this generous manner of testifying to his appreciation
of the valor of the boys from his State. Arriving at Seattle, the troops will be
tendered a public reception and banquet, and each man who participated in any
campaign in the Philippines will be presented with a medal commemorative of
tho fact. Then the regiment will be allowed to disband and each member will
return to his own home.
As soon as the Washington delegation arrived at the Palace yesterday
they were officially called upon l>y the staff of California's executive and ten
dered the usual courtesies. The State tug Markham was placed at the dis
posal of Governor Rogers, to be used by him and thopo whom he wished to in
vite to go our and meet the transport as soon as Bhe Is reported.
Following this visit, a meeting of Washington people was called and plans
arranged whereby all who so desired would be given a chance to go out and
greet the hoys and supply them with a good lunch of those things which they
have not tasted since they sailed away, nearly a year and a half a^<>.

bazaar which is being held in the
League of the Cross Armory on
Market street, near Tenth, has not
waned. In fact, the attendance is on
the increase, due to the energetic
work of Father Crowley rind his corps
of earnest workers In the cause of
charity. Nightly the beautifully dec
orated hall is crowded with the friends
of the charming ladies who preside
over the booths, and their purchases
have gone to swell the fund that is
being raised to help a grand institu
tion.
One of the prettiest and most taste
fully decorated nooks in the hall is
the trained nurses' booth. The ladies
in charge of it have, with the aid of
white cloth, made the interior cool
and Inviting and the visitor thus
learns how a sickroom should be con
ducted. A number of dolls, dressed in
the garb worn by the nurses whilo
pursuing their noble calling, are in
evidence. The nurses In the various
hospitals of this city contributed these
playthings, iiml a vote Is being taken
to decide which doll represents the
most popular hospital. A contest is
also on to decide who is the most
popular physician in this city. A half
hundred doctors are in the race, which
is led by Dr. J. H. Healy, who has 76
votes.
The refreshment booth, which Is
presided over by Mrs. K. M. Lawler,
is one of tho most attractive spots in
the fair, made so by a score of pretty
girls, who wait on the many who drop
In. The room In which refreshments

MILLIONAIRE
POISONED BY
STRIPED BUSS
James Percival Lying
at Death's Door.
â â¢ â
THREE OTHER VICTIMS
â , â¢
DEADLY FISH SEHVED AT A
FASHIONABLE ROTISSEBIE.
â¦
The Tourist's Wife, Isaac Ettling and
S. J. Stanley, the Wine
Man, Were Also
Affected.
James Percival, the well-known million
aire tourist from London, is lying in his
apartments at the Palace Hotel in a pre
carious condition as a result of partaking
too freely of poisoned striped bass served
on Wednesday night at a fashionable up
town restaurant. Mrs. Percival, wife of
the milionaire tourist; Isaac Ettling, the
well-known wheat broker, and S. J. Stan
ley, the popular wine agent, who also
dined at the rotisserie and ate the poi
soned fish, were more or less affected, but
none of them were taken so violently ill
as Percival.
Mr. Percival and his wife attended a
theater party on Wednesday evening and
then drove to a near-by restaurant for
dinner. After the striped bass was served
Mr. Percival complained of griping pains
in his stomach. A few minutes later he
developed symptoms of poisoning and al
most collapsed at the table. He was Im
mediately escorted to his carriage and
hastily driven to his apartments at the
Palace.
By the time he arrived there Mr. Per
cival was suffering excruciating pains and
vomiting quite freely.
. Dr. Noble was quickly summoned and
he diagnosed Percival' a ailment as a case
of peculiar fish poisoning.
Mrs. Percival was suffering slightly,
but mild emetics were sufficient to relieve
her distress and she assisted Dr. Noble
to ease her husband's sufferings.
Mr. Percival's body turned black and
blue and he was writhing in the throes
of severe convulsions for several hours.
Percival's condition caused great alarm,
and for a time it looked as if he would not
survive. Dr. Noble worked over his pa
tient for several hours and remained with
the sick milionaire until morning, when
his condition improved slightly.
None of the other victims were seriously
affected, for luckily they ate sparingly of
the fish.
Whether or not the striped bass was
poisoned during the rooking process Is
nut known, but Dr. Noble believes that
the fish itself contained poisonous prop
erties. An analysis will be made to-day
to determine which of the two theories is
correct. Late last night the chances for
Percival's recovery were pronounced fa
vorable.

â¢
SEQUEL TO THE CONVICTION OF
A CROOK.
â  â¦
The Head of the Department Ap
parently Not Anxious
to Part With the
Amount.
Attorney Archibald Campbell yesterday
afternoon filed suit In the Justices' Court
against Chief Lee? to recover $29 Go. which
amount the plaintiff claims is being un
lawfully held by the head of the Police
Department. Some time ago a bunko man
named Collins was arrested and charged
with grand larceny. When searched at
the City Prison the amount Campbell
sues for was found in his clothes, and at
the request of the arresting officer it was
booked as evidence against the prisoner.
Collins was convicted of the charge by a
jury In the Superior Court the other day,
and as no attempt had been made to in
troduce the money as evidence, Campbell,
who defended the prisoner, claimed it as
part of his fee. After getting an order
for the money from Collins the attorney
presented it to Lees with a formal de
mand for the amount. Lets refused to
surrender it, claiming that he wanted to
consult his attorney before parting with
the "stuff." Campbell waited until yes
terday and as Lees still refused to let
go of the amount he decided to institute
suit against him for its recovery. Ihe
complaint reads as follows:
Archibald Campbell, plaintiff, vs. I. W. Lees
individually and as Chief of Police of the City
and County of San Francisco, defendant.
The said plaintiff comi'lains of the said
defendant and for cause of action states and
c j cB That the said plaintiff and the said de

City and County of San Francisco.
2 That the said defendant is now and at all
the times hereinafter mentioned has been the
duly elected appointed, qualified and acting
Chief of Police of the said City and County of
San Francisco, State of California.
3 That on or about the 17th day of August,
18iÂ»9 one F. W. Collins was arrested in said
city and county and taken to the City and
County Prison and charged with having com
mitted a felony, and that the suld Collins was
then and there searched and that there was
then and there taken from his possession and
turned over to the above-named I. W. Lees,
defendant herein, the sum of twenty-nine dol
lars and sixty-five cents.
4. That on or about the ISth day of Septem
ber ISM. the said F. W. Collins, for a valuable
consideration, to wit, to pay and satisfy plain
tiff herein for legal services rendered said Col
lins in defending and appearing for him In the
Police Court of said city and county, sold, as
signed and set over to the plaintiff herein the
eald sum aforesaid taken from him as afore
eaid and directed the said defendant to pay
the same to the said plaintiff.
6 That said money was not used as evidence
In the trial of the paid Collins and that the trial
of said Collins Is now ended and determined.
6 That plaintiff has notified the said defend
ant of the assignment aforesaid and demanded
that the said defendant pay the said money to
him in ariv>rdance therewith, but that said de
fendant fails and refuses to do so.
Therefore, plaintiff prays judgment against
said defendant Individually and as said Chief of
Police for the sum of twenty-nine dollars and
sixty-five cents and costs of suit.
