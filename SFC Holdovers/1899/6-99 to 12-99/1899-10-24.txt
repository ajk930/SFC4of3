PRESIDENT KRUGER IN PERSON
LEADS THE TRANSVAAL FORCE
At the Head of Nine Thousand Men He Is Now
Attacking Glencoe.
Battle Being Waged Over the Ground Where the British
Were Victorious on Friday and
Saturday.
ONDON, Oct. 23.â The Daily News publishes the following dispatch
from Ladysmilh, dated Sunday night:
"A large force under Commandant General Joubert and Com
mander Vogan opened fire on Dundee yesterday. The I iring was con
tinued to-day. The result is not known here."
Daily Telegraph has received the following from Ladysmith,
dated Sunday at 2:10 p. mÂ«:
The Boers, reported to be 9000 strong and under the command of
ommandant General Joubert and President Kruger in person, are again
to-day attacking Glencoe.
General Yule, commanding our troops, has moved his camp back
into a better defensive position."
'ispatch from Ladysmith, Natal, dated 4:15 yesterday afternoon, has just been received.
It is a literal repetition of the Cape Town-Glencoe advices of yesterday and it is regarded as some
mitwus that nothing has since been received respecting the result, especially when viewed in the
light of Lord Jl'olseley's statement that General Yule's force felt it necessary to retire from Dundee to
function.
General Yule evidently is in a tight comer, as he noiv has, or had to face the main Boer army un-
General Joubert. General Sir George Stewart White, the British commander-in-chief in Natal
tndoubtedly detach part of the force which was victorious at Elands Laagte to his assistance.
h a detachment, however, will leave Ladysmith poorly protected against the threatened attack from
eneral Hunter on Saturday wired that the departure of the force to Elands Laagte left
hit only a couple of battalions of regulars, a mountain battery and 500 Natal volunteers to de
fend flu : <wn, which is the British military base in North Natal. Further news, therefore, is anxious

War Office received the following dispatch from General George Stcivart White, com
mander in Natal, dated at Ladysmith Camp, 4:45 p. m. to-day:
ral Yule telegraphed me 'yesterday evening that the wounded at Dundee were doing well"
This greatly relieves the anxiety regarding Glencoe, as the British there had evidently not been
attacked up to last evening.

The "World's I^ondon correspondent

NEW CHARTER IS UPHELD
BY STATE SUPREME COURT
The Freeholders' Election Decided to Have Been
Properly and Legally Conducted!
All San Francisco's City and County Officers Must Now Step
Down and Out and New Ones Be Chosen to Fill the
Vacant Places as Soon as Possible.
rHE new charter is no longer a political issue. It is now the laze of this municipality. This
was judicially established yesterday by the decree of the Justices of the Supreme Court in two
decisions in which there was not a dissenting voice. One case that was instituted by Super
intendent of Streets Fragley, in which he attacked the validity of the late election of Freeholders who
framed the new charter and assailed the later election of the charter itself. The other case related
exclusively to the status of county officers. Sheriff Martin, County Clerk Dcane and other county of
ficials brought action to determine that the county officers named were elected for a period of four years.
While neither case was brought directly to determine the validity of the charter, the issues involved
made this point a vital one in the matter and the decision of the Justices covers both questions.
The cases were brought against the Mayor and the Board of Election Commissioners to restrain
them from holding the coming election and to prevent them from appropriating money for that purpose.
In the lower court the plaintiffs lost and the higher court holds that thebondholders election and the char
ter election were legal and valid. Hence the charter stands. This also disposes of the case brought by
the county officers icho sought to retain office until the expiration of the four years for which they were
elected. The higher court decided that all county officers must go out of office and new ones be elected to fill
the places, as provided for under the new laws of the city.
The leading opinion was written by Justice Harrison and concurred in by Chief Justice Beatfy
and Justice Henshaw. Another opinion was written by Justice Garoull? and concurred in by Justices
Van Dyke and McFarland. In both opinions the same conclusions were readied, but by different pro
cesses of reasoning. As for the opinion in the case of the county officers Justice I 'an Dyke has the honor
of being its creator and all of the Justices agreed in the findings. This is one of a very few instances
where the entire court has been unanimous in an important matter. The three opinions are as follows:

of the charter In the same precincts. RrtOr to
the holding of each of said elections th>> Board
of Election Commissioners provided for supple
mental registration at the office of the Regis
trar, at the City Hall, but made no provision
for precinct registration. Prior to the consoli
dation of the precincts, as aforesaid, the hoard
passed a resolution that the special election for
Freeholders should be conducted In accordance
with the act relating to the election of Free
holders and charters, aproved March 31, 1597
(Statutes of 1897. p. 2SS), and that the number
of votes for each special election precinct be
estimated at 750, or as near thereto as possible.

March 18, I*7*Â«. they were invalid, and that the
charter adopted thereat was invalid, and con
fers no authority to hold en election for the
offices therein named. The particulars In which
the invalidity of the elections is urged are that
the Board of Election Commissioners had no
authority to consolidate the election precincts,
or to omit precinct registration, and that they
i did not appoint proper election boards for the
| precincts In which the elections were held.
The act of IS7S was a special act relating to
i San Francisco alone, and at the adoption of
; the constitution of is7<> formed a part of the
charter of that city and county. By its pro
, visions the conduct, management and control
i of elections and matters pertaining to elections
j was taken from the Board of Supervisors, which
! under the Political Code, then exercised this
power in other parts of the State, and was con
: l erred upon the Board of Election Commission
ers therein created. Section 6of article Xl. of the
1 constitution of 1579. as originally adopted, after
directing the Legislature to provide by general
laws for the organization of cities and towns,
â¢ declared that "cities or towns heretofore or
hereafter organized, and all charters thereof
framed or adopted by authority of this con
stitution, shall be subject to and controlled by
general laws." In Staude vs. Election Com
missioners, 61 Cal. 321, it was said that the
i effect of this section was that San Francisco
i "shall be subject to and controlled by such
i general laws as the Legislature shall enact,
other than those for the incorporation, organi
zation and classification in proportion to popu
lation of cities and towns." The Political Code
is a general law whose force extends through
out the State, and. in the absence of any
qualifying words, the Legislature must be
deemed to intend that its provision shall have
uniform operation in all parts of the State,
' 1 and it was held in the cas> just cited that an
! amendment to section 4109 of the Political Code
by which the time for the election of all city
I and county officers was made uniform through
; out the State superseded a provision in the
| charter of San Francisco providing a different
time for the election of those officers within
that city and county. In ISS9 the Legislature
amended several sections of this code relating
to elections by extending their provisions to
each of the counties and cities and counties of
the State, and by placing every board having
charge and control of elections In the same
i category with the Board of Supervisors in each
i of the counties of the State, and making the
same provisions for cities and counties as for
â  counties. By so doing it is manifest that it
i was the intention of the Legislature that its
provisions should be operative In San Fran
cisco. The city and county of San Francisco
was the only political subdivision of the State
j in which any board other than the Board of
Supervisors had the control and management
of elections, and as was said in Staude' s case,
we know judicially that it was the only city
and county in the State. To the extent, there
fore, that these amendments are Inconsistent
with or variant from the provisions of the act
of March 18, 1878, the latter is superseded, and
the city and county is subject to and controlled
by the provisions of the Political Code.
By the act of IS7B the Board of Election
Commissioners was required to divide the city
and county into
a A. election precincts
I "as soon after
I each general elec-
I tion as convenl-
I ent, not to exceed
I ninety days." By
I the amendment to
I section 1127 of the
I Political Code the
i^i^i^i^i^i^iSi^i^i^i^i^i^iV i- Mil Is required
to divide the City
and covnty into election precincts "as soon be
fore a general election as is convenient.". Sec
tion 1129 of the Code as originally enacted grave
to the Board of Supervisors in each county au
thority "from time to time to change the boun
daries of, create new or consolidate established
precincts." But there was no provision in
the act of IS7S for charging the boun
daries of the election precincts when once
made, until after another general election. Sec
tion 1129 was, however, amended â In . ISB9 to
read as follows:
"The Board of Supervisors or other board
having charge and control of elections in each
of â¢ the counties and cities of the State may
from time to time change the boundaries of,
create new. or consolidate â  established pre
cincts; provided, that there shall always be as
many precincts as shall be sufficient to make
the number of votes polled at any one pre
cinct to be not more than 200 as nearly as can
be ascertained." Under this section, as thus
amended, the authority of the Board of Elec
tion Commissionere of Sun Francisco to con
solidate established precincts prior to the adop
tion of the amendment to section 6 of, article
XI of the constitution, in IS9B. Is without ques
tion, and unless that amendment has taken
from them this authority they must be held

In 159G the above clause in section 6 of article
XI was amended to read as follows: "Cities
or towns heretofore or hereafter organized, and
all charters thereof framed or adopted by au
thnrlty of this constitution, except In municipal
affairs, shall be subject to and controlled by

pellants that the elections for Freeholders and
upon the adoption of the charter proposed by
th?m were "municipal affairs." and were,
therefore, not subject to or controlled by gen
eral laws.

difficult to Rive a definition â  a "mu

will be exhaustive of precise, it cannot be
that the effort ot the amendment Is to pre
clude the Legislature from enaotins laws
relating to matters which might, be made the
subject of municipal control, or that all mu
nicipalities from all general lawÂ«
which the Legislature may enact. It ha:- been
ntly that it may be said to
have become a maxim in Jurisprudence thaf
a municipal corporation has onl> such |
as are given to it by Its charter, and that it
must find authority in its charter or under
fome general law for every municipal act
which it may perform. The municipal affairs
of any individual municipal corporation are.
therefore, such affairs only as that municipal
lty has the power to engage ;n or perform, and
the municipal affairs of one city may vary
greatly from those ot any other cityâ and this,
too, whether the charter of the city hi
confemd upon it bj the Legislature, or has
been framed by a Board of Freenoldeni of its
own choice, and afterward adopted by its citi
zens and approved by th>- Legislature. In
either case the municipality -â¢â  only

mipht have been Included therein, that city or
Its inhabitants, is not. thereby freed from legis
lative control. The Legislature Is vested with
ihe law-making power ol the state, and th-
Keneral laws passed by it have force in all
parts of thr- Stnt^ unless by virtue of some pro
vision In th" constitution such effect is limited,
or the law-making power has been I
elsewhere.
A city oinnnt claim to he exempt from gen
eral laws relating to municipal affairs r
is no provision relating to such affairs in the
charter under which it is a. tint:, whether such
charter is Ine frame. l by Itself or was given
1 1 it !â¢â  the ! egislature. It' in framing
charter its Board of Freeholders should mako
no provision for ;i public library, or :
improvement of its streets, ihe peneril laws
upon those sul'jecta would be operative with
in that city. It is not within the constitu
tional power of the Legislature, by approving
a Freeholders" charter which fails to make
provision upon subjects pertaining to munici
pal affairs, to exempt that city from belnÃ
subject to legislative control in referen
those subjects. n..r can the city secure exemp
tion from such control by omitting to mnke
such provision in its charter. If by adopting
a charter whi< h failed to give to it power
to act upon affair- which are properly munici
pal a city could be freed from any legislative
control in reference to those affairs, eitl
itself or by the Legislature, that city would
become a veritable Alsatla.
Tnder these considerations it must he held
that the exception in the above clause In

city in the State
is subject to and controlled by general" laws re
lating to municipal affairs, unless by virtue
of some provision of the charter under which
it exists and Is acting such municipal affairs
may be engaged in and performed by it. ThÂ»
clause is to receive a distributive construction,
and is to be read as if its language were:
"Any city or town heretofore or hereafter or
ganized, and every charter thereof framed or
adopted by authority of this constitution, ex
cept in its municipal affairs, shall be subject
to and controlled by general laws."
We have seen that the provisions of the act
of March 18, 1878, relating to the division of
San Francisco into election precincts were
superseded by the amendments to the Political
Code in ISS9. and that from that date these
provisions of the Political Code constituted the
only law upon that subject which was appli
cable to San Francisco. It may be conceded
that each of the elections herein considered.

ment to the Political Code in 1889 there has
been no provision in the charter of San Fran
cisco relating to the creation or consolida
tion of election precincts, the city was subject

ing In reference thereto. Section 1139 Of the
Political Code was in force within the city
and county of San Francisco at the dates of
these elections, and under " this section the
consolidation of the election precincts for thÂ«
purpose of these elections was within the
power conferred upon the Board of Election

We need not determine whether this pro

quiring the registered vote to he the criterion
for fixing the extent of the precincts, or
whether the board had the right to fix their
extent upon its estimate of the number of

A consideration of the spirit and object of
ihe act of ISTS leads also to the same conclu
sion. The main purpose of the act. as shown
by Its provisions, was to secure a full leglstra

convenience tn them as was practicable. For
this purpose the act provides an extended pe
riod for registration at the "ft â¢â  of the Regis
trar, within which voters may be enrolled, and
that at the close of this pt-riod those who hare
been unable to avail themselves or this oppor
tunity may resort/to some designated place
within thMr respective prvcincts, and there be
registered. To still further accommodate the
voters, they are not required to present them
selves for precinct registration within th* usual

that the Boards of Precinct Registration shall

The omission of the Board of Election Com

James D. Phelan ft al., defendants and re
spondents:. Fan Francisco, No. 8048,
This is an action brought by a taxpayer by
Injunction against the Board of Election Com
missioners and other municipal officers of the
city and county of San Francisco to restrain
the expenditures of certain public moneys for
the conduct and carrying on of an election in
said city and county. The primary and direct
purpose of the litigation Is to test the validity
of the new charter of the city and county of
Pan Francisco, which is to take effect January
1. 1900.
The State Legislature of 1897 placed upon the
statute books an act which may be called "The
Charter Election Act." it is entitled "An act
in relation to elections held under the authority
of section 8 of article XI of the constitution,
to elect Boards of Freeholders or to vote upon
proposed charters or upon amendments to ex
isting- chartcrv" The election to secure a
Board of Freeholders In this city to draft a
charter and the election subsequently held to
ratify the action of that Board of Freeholders,
were" held under the aforesaid act The man
ner of holding and conducting these elections,
while in strict conformity with the act, was
widely at variance with the provisions of the
general law as to the manner and conduct of
holding elections "in the city and county of
Han Francisco; and It Is now claimed that
these elections as held were absolutely void by
reason of the unconstitutinnaltty of the statute
under which they were held, and that the elec
tions |.Â«lnp void, therefore the new charter 13
a void and barren Instrument.
The parties now attacking the constltutlonal-
Ity of this act of the Legislature rest the entire
results of the litl-
gatlon upon that
H: attack, conceding
I ' in open court that
they have no cms-
j If that statute be
a valid and con-
BtltutlonsJ law.
; They Insist that

Legal Attack.
that It is vlola
tlve of section 6 of article XI of the constitu
tion, of -the State. That part of section 6 arti
cle XI of the constitution here directly In
volved reads: "Cities and towns heretofore or
hereafter organized and all charters thereof
framed and- adopted by authority of this con
stitution, except in municipal affairs, shall be
subject to and controlled by general laws." It
is â¢ now claimed that thes? two elections, to
which reference has already been made were
"municipal affairs" within the meaning of the
constitution, and therefore, not subject to and
controlled by general laws, in this connection
It Is then claimed that said act of 1&97 is a
general law attempting to deal with and con
trol "municipal affairs," and for that reason
vlolatlve of this constitutional prohibition. As
a second contention it is asserted that th!Â»
statute Is special legislation and also lacking
in uniformity of operation. We at once pass t.i
an examination of these constitutional objec
tions.
The solution of the questions thus presented
largely revolves around the meaning of the
v â  rÂ«ls "except in
H m v n 1 c I pal a: -
H'.l:> " as these
are used in
h e constitution
H': (he State. The
Hi'hrnse formed by
1 words has a
Hni';u'i!'!>; and a
H:>- st significant
â nnr. This is ap
|l';n'"!U when We
pause a moment to consider that this single
phrase forms the subject-matter of an amend
ment to the constitution of the State. The
relationship existing between a State and it*
municipalities Is bo close that it may be said
every city ordinance and every State statute is
a matter of interest to both State and municipal
ity. It may be said that all State affairs are a
matter of substantial interest to the mu
nicipality, nnri that likewise all municipal af
fairs ire a matter of concern to the State.
Yet those interests are Identical and Indirect,
and the meaning of this phrase necessarily
takes a narrower scope. Indeed, in the very
wording of the constitutional provision itself
we find that all matters of legislation per
taining to and bearing upon municipalities do
no' come within t'Â«? significance of the words
What Certain
Words
Really Mean.
"municipal affairs. " as used in the constitu
tion. A mere glance at the provision demon
strates this fact. The constitution provides
that cities and towns, "except as to municipal
affairs." shall be subject to ..n 1 controlled by
general ':.â ' It Is I ere plainly indicated that
a" vast amount of legislation pertaining to
cities and towns dees not come under the
classification of "municipal affairs."
For the purpose of setting at the true sig
nificance of these words then Is no brighter
light to he shed upon them than I? disclosed
by a consideration of the reasons which moved
the legislature to propose the amendment and
the pei.ple to adopt It. What was the evil to
be remedied? What was the good to be gained
by this amendment? The answer Is common,
everyday history. It was to prevent existing
provisions of charters from being frittered
away by general laws, which would repeal
these provisions by Implication. It was to en
able municipalities to conduct their own busi
ness and control their own affairs to the fullÂ«s.t
possible tent in their own way. I; was en
acted upon the principle that the municipality
itstelf knew better what it wanted and needed
than did the State at large, and to give that
municipality the exclusive privilege and right
to enact direct legislation which would carry
out and itisfy its wants and neefs. These
are a few of the reasons wnich give
occasion for this concise but all-significant
amendment to section 8 of article XI of the
constitution of the State. This amendment,
then, was Intended to give municipalities the
sole right to regulate, control and govern their
internal conduct independent of general laws;
and this internal regulation and control by
municipalities form those "municipal affairs"
spoken of in the constitution.
Municipal affairs, as those words are used
in the oraitnic law. refer to the Internal busi
ness affairs of a municipality. It was the in
ternal business affairs of municipalities then ex
isting and those of municipalities to be here
after created that the constitutional amend
ment was framed to meet. There Is absolutely
no sound reason why Freeholders' charters
should not be framed and ratified under gen
eral laws. There Is a multitude of sound rea
sons to be urged why the conduct and pro-
lure of elections for the election of Free
holders and ratification of charters should be
held under general laws. No Bound policy ex
ists demanding special legislation upon such
a subject-matter. As far as there has been
given us light to nee, neither the Legislature
nor the people ever thought of such a thing as
the adoption Of charters when they placed the
words "municipal affairs" in the organic law.
In defining the phrase "county affairs" the
court said In Hawkins vs. Mayor, 84 N. V.. 22.
"County affairs are those relating to the county
in It? organic and corporate capacity and In
cluded' within Its governmental or corporate
powers." Tested by this rule elections held as
preliminary steps toward the creation of a
Freeholders' charter are not municipal af
fairs.
The city and county of San Francisco Is a
municipality. The municipal affairs of this

of Its business .matters. The conduct of the
present municipality's business affairs has
nothing to do with the question of the creation
of a new municipality. The new municipality
will have municipal affairs of its own after it
Is created, and not before. The old munici
pality performs its functions when it ( \rries on
the business intrusted to It. A* a mi (clpallty

wholly passive. If its inhabitants sny to It,
"Stay with us yet a while," it slays. ; If they
Bay, "Your days are ended; you have outlived
your usefulness; stand aside." it makes no pro
test. The decree of the people Is its will. A
municipal affair pertains to something ..which
may be done by the municipality. The creation
of a new charter is a matter not placed in the
hands of the municipality, but in the hands of
the inhabitants thereof, with the consent of the
State. *
As the Legislature alone has the power to
approve a charter, it Inherently, in . the ab
sence of constitutional prohibition; must have
th. power to prescribe the terms, conditions and
mode upon which it will give its approval; and, !
If an election la made necessary by the consti
tution as a condition precedent to the validity
of the charter, the legislature has -the power
to say what shall be the nature of that elec
tion, and how it shall be conducted. And such
power it gives It the right to â¢ say how* many
voting precincts shall be used upon election day.
and what shall be the manner and time for
registration. ,
Viewing this question from another angle. It
seems that the creation of a charter is not
â JPJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ â¢ . sontiai'.y a " 1
Hal":'.'- a municipal
â  aiTulr. It is a
â  State affair, and
H that fact Is rec-
Hcpnized in unmls
â  takable terms by
â  the State when
â  the constitution
â  demands that the
Bsi,'.;- Legislature
approve the In
strument by a majority vote; and until such
approval it has no life. Notwithstanding all
the people of the municipality with a single
voice may ask for a new charter, yet the
State, by and through its Legislature, may
deny that request. The Legislature stands as
the representative of the sovereign power of
the State, and has the arbitrary right to grant
or refuse charters to municipalities. A grant ]
of a charter to a municipality is a grant of
no such power. It la a delegation of a certain
amount of power to the municipality
theretofore vested in the State. It la
a parting with a portion of its sover
eignty. It la for this reason that the
State through Its Legislature must breathe into
the charter th% breath of life; and If the State
withhold its breath such action Is beyond all
review. When the constitution vested this om
nipotent power in the Legislature, it would
seem that the frarners of that Instrument
deemed the creation of a municipal corporation
a State affair of the greatest import.
In speaking of the general principle here in
volved Judge Conley says, in People v. Hurlbut.
24 Mich., 14: "There is no doubt of the right
of the State to do any of these things; not by
virtue of any general authority to take to its -if
the management of the local concerns, but be
cause the Inauguration and modification of
local government ran only be provided for
without confusion and Injustice by the aid of
the guiding and assisting hand of the authority
that creates and modifies. The right In the
State is .i right, not to run and operate the
machinery of local government but to provide
for and put it In motion." This seems to be
the very principle recognized by the framers
of the constitution and carried into effect by
the aforesaid amendment to that instrument.
And it may well be said that while general
legislation as to municipal affairs is there pro
hibited, yet. at the same time the very same
Beet ton ot the constitution reserves to the State,
not the right "to run and operate the machin
ery of local government," but the right to pro
vide for and put the machinery Into motion.
In â¢â  pie vs. City of Oakland, 123 Cal., 604, It
is held that a general law providing for the
manner of annexing adjacent territory to a
municipality did not deal with "municipal af
fairs," and was, therefore, without constitu
tional objection. It would seem that the add
ing of adjacent territory to a municipality and
bringing the Inhabitants of that territory with
in the government of the municipality was a
matter of great moment and interest to the
municipality. Yet it was held not to be such
a municipal affair as contemplated by the con
stitution. Thip court there said: "As the
Legislature alone has the power to authorise
such annexation, it must have the power to
prescribe the terms, conditions and mode of
annexation." This language applies with full
force to Che question under discussion In the
case at bur.
The charter act of 1*97 Is neither special legis
lation, nor does It lack uniformity of operation.

This legislation may be wise or unwise. That
Is a matter with which the court has no con

upon the test, namely. Is this act clearly viola

words, the real question here Is. Does it plainly
and clearly appear that these two elections con

This action is in some measure connected
with that of Fragley vs. Phelan, S. F. No. 204,.
involving the validity of the Freeholders' char
ter. Just decided.
In the complaint of the plaintiffs it is stated:
"That this action is not designed or intend
ed to impeach the validity of the said charter
in any respect other than to have it adjudged
herein that the provisions of said charter, con
cerning the county officers of said city and
county of San Francisco, are in open and fla
grant conflict with the constitution of the
State of California, are an invasion of and an
infringement upon the sovereignty of said
State, are a revolutionary usurpation of power,
and are a palpable violation of the law adopted
by the Legislature of said State, in obedience
to the constitution, and entitled. "An act to
establish a uniform system of county and town
ship government,' approved April 1, â¢ 1857."
A demurrer to the complaint was sustained by
the court below, and plaintiffs declining to
amend Judgment was entered In favor of the
defendants, from which Judgment this appeal
Is taken.
The provisions of the Freeholders' charter
concerning the so-called county officers in
whose behalf this action is prosecuted were
Inserted in said charter In pursuance of the
amendment to article XI of the constitution,
concerning counties, cities and towns, and Is
entitled section * : 2 , adopted in 1896. By that
amendment It in declared: "It shall be com
petent, in all charters framed under the au
thority given by section 8 of article XI of
this constitution, to provide. In addition to
those provisions allowable by this constitution
end by the laws of the State, as follows: 4.

At the name session of the Legislature an
act was passed, April 15, 1850, to incorporate
the city of San Francisco. The southern boun
dary line of said city, as thus â¢ incorporated t
waÃ two miles distant from the center of
Portsmouth square, and "parallel to the street
known as Clay street," and the western boun
dary was a line a mile and a half in a west
erly direction from Portsmouth square, "and
parallel to a street known as Kearny. street."
The act provided for a : complete organization
and a full set of officers for the city, inde
pendent of the county officers of the county of
San Francisco. The acts creating the county,
and also the city, were amended at subsequent

an act was passed "tv repeal the several char
ters of the city of San Francisco, to establish
the boundaries of the city and county of Pun
Francisco and to consolidate the government
thereof." By the first section of said act it
is> provided that "the corporation or body poll
tic and corporate, now existing and known as
the city of San Francisco, shall remain and
continue to be a body politic and corporate In
name and in fact, by the name of the city and
county of San Francisco, and by that name
shall have perpetunl succession, may sue and

matters and proceedings whatever, and may
have and may use a, cummon seal; an 1
the same may alter at pleasure, and may pur
chaso, receive, hold and enjoy real and per- |
sonal property, and sell, convoy, mortgage and I
dispose of the same for thS common benefit."
By the second section it is provided that "the
public buildings*, lands and property, all rights
of property and riphts of action, and all
moneys, revenues and Income belungins or
appertaining either to the corporation of the
city of Pan Francisco, or to the county of San
Francisco, are hereby declared to be vested

and property appertaining to the t-ald city or

and received Into the treasury of the city and

The boundaries of the new municipal corpo
ration designated as the city and county of

were fixed as at

the State into
counties, providing for the formation of the
county of San Francisco, was repealed. It waa
further provided in said act that the existing
provisions of law defining the powers and
duties of county officers, excepting those relat
ing to Supervisors, so far as the mime were
not repealed or altered by Bald act, should be
considered an applicable to the officers of said
city and county of San Francisco, and among
the enumerated officers to be elected for said
new municipal corporation were, In addition to
purely city officers, the officers formally desig
nated as county officers.
From the passage of the consolidation act to
the Constitutional Convention of 1878-9, the
city and county of Sen Francisco had been a
subdivision of the State, and as such, and by
that name and style organized and existing
as a body' politic and corporate. Its charterâ
the consolidation actâ had been added to and
amended, but the general form and substance
of the municipal government had not been
changed. And sine* the passage of the con
solidation act the county of San Francisco hnd
ceased to exist as a body politic or corporate,
Independently of and separate from the mu

ELATED OVER
THE DECISION
ON THE CHARTER
Great Republican Vote
Now Assured.
There was great rejoining- at Republi
can headquarters ln?t evening over the
newa thai the Supreme Court of the State
had sustained the new charter of San
Francisco. The chairman of the cam
paign committee remarked that the de
< isi<m would add 5iÂ»M) names to the Repub
lican roll of voters.
The decision of the court clears the
political atmosphere. All doubt as to the
validity of the charter has been removed.
Pending the decision a little coterie of
demagogues without known political
principles assumed Borne sort of proprie
torship of the charter, but the court
knocks the last prop from under the pre
tended ownership. The charter now be
longs to the people. It is true that the
Intelligence and patriotism of Republi
cans were Invoked in tin- framing of the
charter; that Republican districts gave
the organic act the largest majorities, and
It is true likewlst that the charter was
ratified by a Republican Legislature.
Nevertheless, it now belongs to the whole
people, bearing in this respect the same
relation to the community that the consti
tution of the United Btates bears to the
whole country.
At th polls on November 7 the people
will-elect officers to administer atfairs of
government under the local constitution.
The party that succeeds at the polls will
1Â»- held responsible for thÂ«- administration
of the city government The Republicans
have put forward Horace Davis for the
honor Âf serving .is the tlrst Mayor under
th.- new charter. The Democratic follow
ers of the Committee ol One Hundred
have placed James D. I'hrlan in the fteld
for the Mayoraltj and the People's party
enters the municipal contest under the
leadership of Dr. Cleveland. Democrats
an- divided in their allegiance. Some es
pouse the cause of Phelan and olhers Sup
port Cleveland. The Republicans are
solid for Horace Davis. There was some
wavering before the decision of the co'irt
was handed down, but now all Republi
cans appreciate the importance of the
contest and will lend their energies to
elect Horace Davis and the entire Repub
lican ticket.
The Democrats are divided now, but
trades may be made before election day
which will bring many of the wavering
Into line. Phelan and McNab counted fio
confidently on non-partisan and Repub
lican support that they did not, in mak
ing up the ticket, consult the delegateb
elected to the Democratic convention, but
on the contrary prepared the ticket as
early as September 15. The Call on that
date published the ticket. Before the
convention adjourned Democratic aspir
ants who did not take orders from McXab
knew that they had been duped and be
trayed. Many resolute Democratic voters
and especially those who rally around
the free silver standard of Bryan, believe
now that Democratic defeat in this
municipal contest would be better for the
party In the coming great campaign of
1900 than the success of the McNab-
Phelan dynasty. It Is highly probable,
therefore, that Dr. Cleveland, the nominee
of the People's party, will receive a large.
Democratic vote.
Phelan is already hard at work In his
efforts to conciliate the straight-out Dem
ocrats. Before the primary election he
declined to attend a meeting of the Demo
cratlc Central Club, on the ground that It
was a Buckley Democratic organization.
Since he learned that the Republicans
were everywhere lining up for Horace
Davis he has consented to address the
Central Club.
The Republicans are conducting a vig
orous, united and effective campaign. If
the leaders succeed in bringing out a full
Republican vote. Horace Davis will se
cure a handsome plurality for Mayor on
election day. The attendance at the great
Republican mass meeting at Metropolitan
Temple last Saturday night, and the suc
cess of the district meetings last night,
indicate that the people are alive to the
importance of the struggle.
To-night Horace Davis and other speak
ers will address the people of the Thirty
second Assembly District at the Pntrero
Opera-house. Mr. Davis will surely se
cure a gnat ovation from the working
men of that quarter of the city, as he is
a toiler himself. He has worked his own
way forward in life, unaided by inherited
millions. He is In touch and sympathy
with his fellow workers and deserves the
support of honest tollers.
A joint meeting of the voters of the
Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Assemhly
Dletricts will be had at Garibaldi Hail
on Broadway to-night. Mr. Davis and
other candidates will address that meet-

seem difficult to more effectively merge two
separate bodies into one. Besides, in the Con
stitutional Convention of ]S7S-!i the city and
county of Can Francisco was referred to and
treated as a merged and consolidated mu
nicipal government, and It was then, as now,
the only municipal government of that kind In
he State.
That portion of section 7 of article XI of the
constitution where merged and consolidated
municipal. governments are referred to has not
been changed Blnce It was reported to the
[Convention by the Committee on Municipal Cor
porations, an,d the debates show that the terms
there used referred to a municipal government
like that of the city and county of San Fran
:isco. During the debate on the various amend
merits proposed to that portion of section 7
referring to the two houses of legislation (since
annulled by constitutional amendment), Judge
Hager. the chairman of the committee, in re
plying, said: "I had no idea that this section
was going to create so much difficulty in the
convention or receive so much apparent oppo
sition. The section as drawn was intended to
be for the city of San Francisco." (Debates of
the Constitutional Convention, p. 1058.)
Those remarks of Judge Hager were not ques
tioned by any member, and it is fair, therefore,
a^ a^ a^ a^ a^ a^ a^ a^ a^ a^ a^ a _ to assume that
the convention
understood that
when using the
term "merged
and consolidated
into one munlcl-
pal government"
HI it had reference
at that lime only
v to tie city ami
county of San
Francisco, and also to any .similar consolidated
corporation that might thereafter be created.
When the following section, eight (then sec
tion 9), providing for freeholders' charters was
under debate, Judge Hager remarked: "This
applies strictly and only to the city and county
of San Francisco." (The section originally re
quired a population of more than 100.00 to en
title the inhabitants to such city to frame such
a charter.) He further said: "I cannot see
that any evil will come from it: we have this
peculiar government there, a consolidated city
and county government. I do not agree with
my friend from Sacramento that the tendency
is" to multiply offices. The tendency is to re
duce the number of offices. Instead of having
a set of city officers and a set of county of
ficer? they are consolidated. We have a Sheriff
who is the Sheriff of the county and of the city.
â¢ â¢ â¢ We have a Tax Collector, and we have
an Auditor that acts for both; formerly we had
one for each. The tendency of an consolidated
government is to reduce the offices! from two to
one in every case, and reduce the expense in
every particular, and not, as the gentleman
said, for the purpose of multiplying offices
It is further contended by the appellant that
section 814 of article XI is invalid, for the rea
son that It was submitted to the people under
the general law passed March 7, 1&83, providing
for the submission of constitutional amend
ments, instead of being submitted specially by
the Legislature proposing the amendment.

amendment has been considered and sustained
by this court. Besides, there are many other
amendments that have been in like manner
submitted and adopted since the passage ot the
act of ISS3. There is no constitutional objection
to the passage of such an act. and that bring
the case. It is entirely proper for the Legisla
ture to provide by general, Instead or special,
legislation for submitting constitutional amend
ments to the people.
The causes leading- up to the adoption of con
stitutional amendment section BH are well
known. In the Freeholders' charter of the city
of Los Angeles provision was made for the es
tablishment of a Police Court and the election
of Judges thereof. In People vs. Teal, 85 Cal .
333. it was held by this court that sue* pro
vision of that charter was Invalid, for the rea
son that Inferior courts, Including Police
Courts, could only be established as provided
by article VI, concerning the judicial power of
the State, and that it 18 there provided that the
Legislature may establish Inferior courts in any
incorporated city or town, or city and county;
and this meant that an act must be passed
by the Legislature in the form and manner
prescribed in article IV, legislative department,
and that the. approval of the Freeholders' char
ter by a vote of the two houses of the Leg
islature was not equivalent to the passage of
a Itw as provided in said legislative article.
Hence the new section. Si* of article XI of the
constitution, subdivision 1, confers, in express
terms, the power to provide in Freeholders'
charters "for the constitution, regulation, gov
ernment and jurisdiction of Police Courts, and
for the manner In which,' the times at which
and the terms for which the Judges of such
courts shall be elected or appointed, and for
the compensation of such Judges and their
clerks and attaches." And to remove any
doubt that may have previously existed con
cerning the status of officers of the class prose
cuting this action in merged and consolidated
municipalities It Is further- expressly provided
In the amended section. 8%. that It shall be
competent In a Freeholders' charter of such
consolidated government to provide for the
election of such officers for such municipality.
There Is no room for doubt, therefore, as to the
purpose of the Legislature in proposing said
amended section S>Â« of article XI, or <â¢Â» the
people in voting upon and approving the same.
It Is contended, however, on the part of the
appellants that the provisions of said amended
section *'<>. un-
der consldpratlon,
cannot be carried ;
out, for the rea- i
son that it would

words, that the law (and a Freeholders' char
ter adopted as provided for In th constitution
Is a law of the highest grade) cannot be
passed, although in pursuance of express
power granted by the constitution, because it i
may perhaps Infringe upon some other law.
The rule of construction invoked by appellants
seems to be that a provision in a law or con- I
stitution In reference to a particular matter Is
Inoperative and void if it be inconsistent with
the general provisions of said law or constitu- ;
tion. . The direct opposite is the true con
struction In such cases.
"The more specific provision controls, the gen
eral, without regard to their comparative
dates; the two acts, operating together, and
reither working the repeal of the other."

It Is intended, for In such case the particular !
and the general both stand together, neither

But the act establishing a uniform system
of county and township government does not !

lants. The first section provides that the sev

have the power specified In said act. Among
those are the power to sup and to be sued, to
purchase and hold land within its limits, to

cisc of its powers, to manage and dispose of

.as urn authorized by law. Trip county of San
Francisco, as already shown, since the passage
of the consolidation act. has never, as such,
owned or possessed any property or performed
any of the acts of- a corporate body. Further, !
the general law provides that â  "each county ;
must have a board of supervisors consisting of
five members." The county of San Francisco '
never has had such a board, or any board of
supervisors since, the consolidation act. The
general county government act also provides
for justices of the peace and constables In the ;
several townships of the county, and there are
no justices of the peace or constables in the I
townships of the county of San Francisco, since I

fact. It Is toe obvious for question or argument
that the general law establishing- a uniform
system of county government does not apply to
the city and county of San Francisco. Further,
section 8 of article XI, as it now stands, de
clares that when said charter is approved as !
therein provided, "It shall become the charter i
of such city, ' or if such city he consolidated
with a county, then for such city and county '
and shall become the organic law thereof, arid
supersede any existing charter, and all amend- j
ments thereof, and all laws inconsistent with

it read, "All special laws inconsistent with

is In line with other amendments to the other :
section* of the article in question, and would
seem to remove all doubt that such charters are
not subject to existing laws, whether general
or special. Judgment affirmed.

SAYS AMERICA MUST
BACK GREAT BRITAIN
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.â Clifton R.
Brecklnridge, United States Minister to
Russia during the second Cleveland ad
ministration. In an interview to-night
said that In case any nation or com
bination of nations should attempt to
embarrass England in the present war in
South Africa It would be the imperative
duty of the United States to take the
part of Great Britain and sustain her
with our whole moral and material
gth.
"I do not know that any nation or
group of nations contemplates or desires
to take advantage of the present embar
rassment of England for the purpose of
crippling her as a great power, but I do
not hesitate to say as a citizen that if
such purpose should become manifest it
would be required of us by every consid
eration of interest and duty to take the
part of England against any such attacks
and. if necessary, to put forth our whole
strength in her defense.
"Great Britaln"s action in South Africa
is in line with the duty and development
of the Anglo-Saxon race. In her present
struggle she deserves the unanimous bud
port of the American people. In case
other European nations should, through
international Jealousies, attempt to re
tard her in the clear and simple duty she
â  rforming at this time, the condui I
of the United States should be determined
by a consideration mightier than mere po
litical expediency or political precedence.
We should b" enjoined by every
mont of patriotism and every tie of I
kinship to stand shoulder to shoulder with
our brethren across the sea."

Fuller accounts of Saturday's battle at

the greatest tenacity to the last, only

After the battle the Boers dead and

possible In the dark. General French

"The news thus far received from
South Africa would rather favor the Brit

W( L f or Americans to remember that nine
out of ten dispatches received from the

! I do not believe that the Boers have been
repulsed as badly as the press dispatches
have stated. I realize as well as anybody
that Great Britain has a tremendous
! power, and had she to deal with a small
nation like the Transvaal located within
reach of the guns of her ships there
would be ;t speedy ending of the war; but
the Transvaal Is a gigantic fortress In
: itself. The Boers are determined to main
j tain their independence; they are willing
i to sacrifice all, and the fight will be ;i
| bloody one from the very start. England
; has a much more difficult task than her

ness of this statement will be borne out by

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Eng., Oct. 23.â During
the course of the day's proceedings,
while the House was discussing the
report on the supplementary esti
mates Patrick O'Brien, Parnellite
member for Kilkenney City, de
clared that the hands of the Brit
i- . Secretary of State for the Col
onies, Joseph Chamberlain, were
as much stained with blood as
those of any murderer who ever
mounted the scaffold. The Speaker,
William Court <Ju)ley, called on Mr.
O'Brien to withdraw his remark,
but he refused to do so, whereupon
the House by a vote of 316 to 26 re
solved to suspend him, and he left
the House remarking, "You had
better bring up another army corps
unless you want it somewhere
else."
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 23.â The Parlia- i
meruary Secretary of the War Office, Mr. i
George Wyndham, made a statement in
the House- of Commons to-day, saying:
Lord Wolseley sums up the position In Natal
early this morning as follow*:
In the battle of Elands Lajicte. October 21.
two tuns were captured from the Boers, who
lost heavily.
A large column of the enemy appeared ad
vancing from the northwest on General Yule,
â who consequently had fallen bark fn>m Imn
dee and was concentrating ai Glencoe Junction.
In this operation we gathered in the wounded
and medical attendants left at Dundee.
General White was in position at Ladysmith
and is being reinforced from Pietermaritzburg.
The enemy appears to be in large numerical
superiority.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer. Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach, made a statement
on the question of the expenditures made
by the Transvaal war. He said the ex
penditures for the year had been in
creased by the supplementary vote to a
total of Â£121.2(6.000. but he added the rev
enue had increased and he expected there
would be an increase of Â£3,000,000 over his
estimated revenue.
This would be a considerable contribu
tion toward the. unforeseen expenditures
and would leave about Â£7,000. <Xhi to be pro
vided. He thought there should be
no addition to the llxed debt, but the for
mer should be raised by a temporary
addition to the floating debt. The Chan
cellor of the Exchequer, therefore, asked
for power to raise Â£8.000,000 by treasury
bills, the whole question of repayment
and the question of fresh taxation" to be
left over to the next financial year.
Sir Michael also pointed out that the
present war differed from previous ones
and that the estimates had been more
carefully drawn up. No one could fore
see uli.it the total would be, but the Brit
ish troops had met with brilliant success
and the colonies were loyal. Although
there might be something !n to-day's
news giving cause for anxiety, vet he saw
no reason to anticipate that the campaign
wÂ«>uld not be brought to a close within
the period for which the estimates were
framed.
As British colonies had been Invaded, he
considered It to be consistent with all the
laws of war if. whin It was brouffht to a
successful termination. the attacker
should at any rate have to bear part of
the cost. The Transvaal, he continued
was wealthy In its gold Qelda. Ther. had
been complaints from th nterested In
the gold fields that there had been exe-s
--;-ixo taxation, bue he believed from the
i). st Information that under j pure nnd
honest Ciovernmrnt it would be perfectly
possible for the Transvaal to bear not
only the ordinary expenses of government
ana of providing for the maintenance of
p.'acr and ord( r within the territory but
also to provide a reasonabli sum toward
the expenses .of thr- war, with a reduction
at the pnmo urn- of the taxation of the
gold fields. â¢'ontinuing, Sir Ml
Hicks-Beach said:
If these anticipations are not fulfilled and the
chiefs of the revolutionary groups con
tinue to surrender under promise of am
nesty.

misunderstood abroad. 1 shall not take any
r'lurse whlrh will promote a division or pre
vent us from presenting a united tront in this
crisis.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the
leader of the opposition, agreed that this
was not the proper time to discuss the
financial question and that it was not
desirable to show a sign of disunion.
The proposals of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach
were agreed to by a vote of 338 to 2.
The reference of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer to the anxiety as to the latest
news apparently referred to Lord Wolse

CECIL RHODES ASKS
FOR REINFORCEMENTS
LONDON, Oct. 24.â The Daily Mail says
it understands that a message was receiv

Rhodes, dated Kimberley, October 19, de
claring in substance that the inhabitants
of Kimberley desired to draw the attention
of the Government to the need of speed
ily sending reinforcements there, as the
town was being surrounded by increasing
numbers of Transvaal and Free State
Boers. The matter, according to the
Daily Mail, has been submitted to the
Cabinet.
The correspondent of the Daily Mail at
Durban, Natal, says: An official of the

JUBILATION

APPREHENSION
London Fearful That All
Has Not Gone Well at
the Front.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON", Oct. 21.â N0 news yet re
ceived tends to dispel the apprehension
caused by Lord Wolseley's brief sum
mary of the situation. A Pietermaritzburg
dispatch says that the censor now permits
no message to be sent from the front.
Other dispatches represent the Boers as
boasting that Dundee is absolutely cut oft
and assert that despite the British victo
ries the situation is still uncertain.
The Pretoria dispatch giving the report
of General Joubert to the Government evi
dently refers to the first battle at Glen
coe, and the reasons why Commandant
Erasmus failed to come to the assistance
of Commandant Meyer cannot be fath
omed. Had he done so the British victory
might have been still more dearly bought.
Probably Commandant Meyer, having ar
rived at the rendezvous first, thought to
get all the glory of wiping out the Brit
ishers himself, and opened attack without
waiting for the others. If so the Boers
suffered badly because of his hastiness.
It appears certain, however, that the
brilliant victory at Elands Liaagte was
productive of no effect for the relief of.
Glencoe, and the very reticence and brev
ity of Lord Wolseley*s communication are
only ominous. It seems to be worded to
prepare the public for bad news, and it is
only too likely that General Yule has been
! compelled to abandon the wounded and
! prisoners at Dundee because his force is
1 too weak to hold the four and a half milea
I separating Dundee from Glencoe.
I Probably General Yule believes he can
I better protect Dundee from an enemy ad
i vancing from the northwest by concen
! trating all his available strength at Glen
coe where there now 3.500 men and three
batteries. In the meantime efforts will bo
mads to reopen the railway and to get re
inforcements from Ladysmith.
It is expected that Commandant Eras
mus has by this time joined Commandant
General Joubert. and that their combined
columns amount to some 10,000 or 11.000
men while the Free State Boers now
threatening Ladysmith from the east and
a column reported to be coming through
I Zululand must also be reckoned with.
In short General Sir George Stewart
White has been unable to follow up his
, successes and is obliged to remain at
Ladysmith without being able to restore
I railway communication, which is probably
I broken at other points besides Elands
Laagte.
Thus the enemy, although their original
plan, which was supposed to have been
Colonel Schiel's, failed, may fairly be
credited with having isolated General
Yule's brigade and divided the British
forces in Natal. General Yule may find
- himself in a tight place, needing all his
experience in Indian and Burmese fighting
to extricate himself.
It is quite evident that the v ar Office
has news which has been withheld from
i the public, and if the situation as here
I sketched is confirmed. Boer divisions may
i be expected at other frontier points.
Up to midnight the War Office was be
! sieged with inquiries, the heavy lists of
British losses causing much heartburning.

' "If this is the price of suzerainty, good
I God, but we are paying in full!"

CHAPELLE STANDS
BY THE FRIARS IN
THE PHILIPPINES
Replies to the Statements Al=
leÂ£ed to Have Been Made by
General Funston,
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.â Archbishop
Chapel Ie of Now Orleans, Apostolic dele-.
Kale 'â¢> Cuba, Porto Rico and the Phllip
pin. s. to-day gave out the following state
ment :
"In answer to General I-'unstoifs State
ment made In an address to the
students of Stanford University that 'if
Congress would drive out the friars and
confiscate every inch of church property
the bottom would drop out of the Insur
rection within onÂ« week. The Inhabitants
of Luzon aro completely under the
church." I derm It proper to make the fol
lowing statement:
"Knowing what I do from most reliable
authority of General Punston's broad
mindedness and sense of fairness, I do not
believe that he has been quoted correctly,
lie. may have stated that the insurgents
demand this as a condition of pence, but
that he gave them as his own sentiments
I cannot credit.
"From my own experience, I know how
easy it is to be misquoted. All 1 can Fay
is that if General Funston did make this
statement, he manifested a dense iijnor
a:^ce of tht* work done t..." the religious
orders in ;he archipelago. t>n the very
face of it, how< â¢ it shofcs quite^ plainly
that it did not come from one as well
posted as General Funston should be on
affairs in i.:-/.i:. He is quoted as saying,
"The inhabitants of Luzon are complete-'
ly. under the church.' Now, I would ask
how can this be possible v, ! : â â  : every
priest (with the exception of a few na
tives) in the island of Luzon, outside of
the walled city of Manila , is a prisoner of
the Insurgents. For the past eignteon
months this state of affairs has existed,
and during all this period more than three
hundred and fifty friars have been under,
going unheard of torture in insurgent
dungeons. 'Phis being- a fact, it is hard
for me to see how the islands can be 'un
der the friars." It looks to me as though
just the opposite ere th( case. Th 1 1 the
insurgents have asked as one of their
terrhs of peace the expulsion of the friars
and the confiscation to the Insurgents of
all the church property is a fact well
known, but we are told by the Govern
ment officials land I know ii to be a fact
from othrr reliable sources) that the in-
Burgents represent only one tribe out of
the eighty-live tribes peopling the archi
pelago, so the sentiments voiced by the
insurgents about the friars and church
property cannot be taken as the senti
ments uf the great body of natives, no
more than they can be taken as the senti
ments of the "natives toward our people
and Government.
"Whatever the natives are or have,
they owe to the friars. By them they
were lift <=Â»l out of savagery and brought
under the blessed and refining Influences
of Christianity. By thorn they were edu
cated not only In the schools, but In the
llelds and in th.- workshops were taught
by them the very Industries which are
now the source of their prosperity. Mr.
Peyton: the agent of the Episcopal For-:
(igrn Mission Association; tells us that the
natives 'are thÂ»> most moral and religious
on the free of the globe.' Now the men .
who taught tin-in to be so cannot bÂ« such
men as some narrow-minded.' people wouM
try to have us believe. Rev. Di Ambell,
a Scotch Protestant missionary, also tes
tifies that 'nearly the whole population
of the Philippine Archipelago has been
converted to the Catholic faith by the
Spanish monks, and a wonderful Improve
ment In their social condition has been
the result.' Up then goes on to show that
If any one doubts this Improvement; it
can easily be made manifest by compar
ing the Christian native wi'h his southern
neighbor of the same blood, the fanatical
Morro.
"As to the confiscations of the estates,
you might as well talk of confiscating the
estates of the Vanderbilts, the Astora
and other millionaires whose estates have
in the course of years grown so wonder
fully. There would be just as much right
and" justice in one er.se as in the other.
The status of the religious estates has
been acquired in the usual way by pur
chase, and In the course of nearly four
centuries they have naturally grown
large, but if even unbiased Protestant
witnesses arc- to be credited; large as they
are, all are used for the betterment and
uplifting "f the natives.
"A former British Consul Ca Protestant)
writing on this subject says: 'It was by
means of these estates the friars intro
duced agriculture and settled habits of
life among tribes originally nomadic.'
"It was by means of thÂ»se estates thai
they pot them to live in villages and in
troduced among them the arts of civil
ized life.
"It was by this means that they ac
quired the power of inducing them to
labor with a certain amount of regularity
nnd method-tho great safeguard against
a relapse again into their original state
of savagery.
"The natives, h" says, are, with pome
rare excentions; In need of tufflaee. with
out which they would fall back to thÂ»
customs of their ancestorsâ a tutelage
that no one can exercise better than the
friars. Within the precincts of the mon
asteries are to be found carpenter shops,
forges, brick and tile yards, etc.. to teach
the natives various trades. The villages
formed around them presented a pleasing
picture of happiness and content in start
linn contrast to those who were still pa
gan and uncivilized.
"In a short time I will start for the
Philippines, and l will personally Investi
gate all charges made against religious
orders titles of property, etc. Until I
have completed my work I would ask
the good people of the I'nited States not
to be too ready to allow as facts the
opinions of trer.tlemen whose previous
training and lack of opportunities to get

statements concerning the Catholic min

May End Quicker.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.â With the ar
-1 rival of Professor Worcester to-morrow
night or Wednesday morning all the mem
bers of the Philippine Commission except
General Otis will have assembled in
Washington and a meeting of the com
mission will be held. It is thought some
time Wednesday.
It is the President's desire that the com
miteiOD get to work without further de
lay. He Intends to treat extensively the
Philippine situation in his forthcoming
message to CongTess and he will depend
m a lorge degTee upon the report of the
commission for material.
It is apparent from the renewed activity
in military operations In the Philippines
within the last ten days that General
Otis proposes to strain every effort to
bring thi Insurrection to an early close.
Thus, under the President's direction,
while the soldiers are subduing Aguinaldo
the Philippines commission will be en
gug-ed in formulating suggestions to be
enforced by Congress for the treatment
of the islanders hereafter.
It Is known that the members of the
commission, and Admiral Dewey especial
ly, are Impressed with the ability of
gome of til,- Filipinos for self-govern
ment. In the [Bland of Xegros self-gov
ernment already is in force to a consid
erable degree, and the natives are prac
tically conducting municipal and local
; affairs with little aid from the Americans.
They appreciate, the benefits which
Americana propose to give them and are
anxious even n >\v to assist the Ameri

There seems to be little doubt the com

under I .â â :,! policy of this country,
regarding the Philippines shall '[Â«â  given

FATHER McCABE
CULLED BY DEATH
Priest Who Freed John
Boyle O'Reilly.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PATL. Minn., Oct. 23.â A Waseea
[ (Minn.) special says: Rev. M. 1\ McCabe.,
i the well-known Roman Catholic clergy
! man, died on Saturday evening of Brighfs
j disease at St. Mary's, a small mission
near Waseca. His death recalls an ex
! ploit in which he was a conspicuous fac
tor. It was Father McCabe who was In
strumental in liberating the political pris
oner, John Boyle O'Reilly, who afterward
became the noted American poet.
O'Reilly was detected propagating Fe
nlanism in England. He was arrested
and sentenced to penal servitude. It hap
pened that Father McCabe was stationed
lat the Australian prison as chaplain. To
; him O'Reilly confided his intention of
. making his escape. The priest offered to
; aid him. On a dark night in 1569 the two
j met by appointment and the priest and
the prisoner exchanged clothes. In this
disguise O'Reilly departed in an open boat
without food or drink.
After three days of terrible exposure to
the perils of the sea O'Reilly was picked
up by an American whaler and carried
I to T^iverpool. Thence he made his way
i quickly to the T'nited States.
The priest reported to the prison offl
! cials that he had been waylaid by the
! convict, who compelled him to make the
I exchange of clothes. "When the truth
; leaked out later on Father McCabe was
' obliged to make a hasty departure from
Australia. He came to this country and
applied to Bishop Ireland for a charge in
: this diocese about eighteen years ago. He
j has remained in Minnesota ever since.

CONVICTS USE GAS
INSTEAD OF OPIUM
Desperate Chances Taken by Men
Who Are Victims of the
Drug Habit.
SAX QVENTIN PRISON, Oct. 23.â Warden Aguirre's detective work In
preventing the convicts from obtaining opium has lÂ«d to a number of pecuirar
subterfuges on the part of the fiend? to obtain something which would tena
toward satisfying their craving for the drug. The latest practice of the pris
oners addicted to the use of opium is so strange that few who have not Deen
convinced by observation will give the matter any credence.
While Guard Randolph was in the carpenter-shop yesterday he detecte
the smell of -scaping gas. and. thinking the pipes were leaking, started cm
a tour of investigation. Behind a carpenter's table In an obscure corner ms
eyes beheld a sight that astounded the guard, accustomed as he is to wit
nessing things of a startling nature. On the floor lay a life-term convict,
seemingly in an unconscious condition, while by his side sat another pris
oner, inhaling the fumes from a gaspipe through a rubber tube, liotn men
were sent to the dungeon after Dr. Casey had resuscitated the unconscious
man. An investigation showed that the convicts, who were both nashesh
fiends', had made a minute puncture in the gaspipe, and had been inhaling the
poisonous gas through the rubber tube to satisfy in part their craving for a
drug which could not be obtained.
Another disc. .very later in the day added to the amazement produced by
this one. Warden Aguirre was sent for at his residence and taken by Cap
tain Edgar to a cell where a guard stood watching two more convicts. These
two prisoners stood with arms bared and bleeding and confessed that to sat
isfy the cravings of a diseased appetite they had slit holes in the skin of
their arms and injected a weak solution of the chloride of lime used in disin
fecting their cells. They, too, were locked up in the dungeon. A search
showed that after slitting holes In their arms they had used glass fountain
pen-fillers, with a rubber bulb on the tip, to inject the solution of chloride
of lime. Fifteen men formerly fiends have been almost cured of the opium
habit, and these four convicts will be placed under Dr. Casey's care in a
very short time.

THROWN INTO JAIL
IN A FOREIGN LAND
Salvation Army Ensign 111-Treated
in Turkey and Not Protected
by the American Consul.
NEW YORK, Oct. 23.â The attorney for !
the Salvation Army has called the atten
tion of Secretary Hay to me indignities
alleged to have been heaped upon Joseph
Garabed, an ensign of the Salvation Army ,
known all over the United States as '"Joe
the Turk," who visited Turkey recently
for the purpose of visiting some of his
relatives. On July 11, 1899, he got a pass
port and necessary papers which he sup
posed would protect him as an American ]
cltisen in Turkey, having been a citizen
of this country for more than eighteen
years. On landing, instead of receiving
protection, he says his passport was con
temptuously rec< ived and he was seized
by the Turkish authorities and thrown
into jail.
By considerable expenditure, Garabed
says, he was able to roach a I'nited j
States Consul. He snvs the Consul not
only refused to protect, but ordered him
to leave the country, as the Turks liad j
directed, on the very nexi steamer, or
else to he incarcerated by the Consul in
the American Jail until the Consul could
place him aboard a steamer to some for
elgn port. Garabed took a Russian steam
ship and left the country.

AN ATTACK BY RUSSIA
Much Speculation Caused by the Sailing oi
the Squadron to Gibraltar.
NEW YORK. Oct. 24.â A dispatch to the
Tribune from London pays: The sailing
of the channel squadron to-day for Gi
braltar is now regarded by the keenest
observers as an Indication that some un
expected attack upon ' British interests
is possible. The magnitude of the prep
arations for war, which are out of
all proportion' to the requirements of the
military situation, can be adequately ex
plained on the theory that the Govern
ment suspected that Borne great power
would be tempted to seize the opportun
ity for striking a sudden blow or carry-
Ing out a deeply cherished policy.
The quarter from which an attack of
this kind may come Is unmistakable. The
Russian press has had license to criticize
the English policy In South Africa in the
most acrid way, and a rumor that Herat
may be occupied Is already in the air.
British commercial Interests In Persia are
bo large that a Russian seizure of the
commanding; position in West Afghan
istan would be a serious stroke, aimed
directly against free trade. That seems
a more likely menace than the forcing of
the Dardanelles by the Russian Black Sea
lleet.
The movement of a powerful French
fleet to tho Levant coincides with the cir
culation of a rumor that the Russian ad
vance may be resumed In Asia while Eng
land is preoccupied at war in South Afri
ca. It also fits in with the explanation
of a secret agreement between England
and Germany, which I have already given
In previous dispatches. This was that
England, in return for a free hand In
South Africa in settling the Transvaal
' question, had agreed not to make any
hostile use of her lleet If the German Em
peror were to decide to follow up his visit
to Jerusalem with a serious attempt to
colonize any portion of Asia Minor and
to bring it under German influence.
A prominent diplomatist whom I con
sulted yesterday remarked that the nature
of tho Anglo-German agreement was the
closest secret in European diplomacy, but
That the foregoing statement was the most
reasonable explanation which he had ever

HOW CAPTAIN HOWARD

WASHINGTON. Oct 23.â The following
telegram confirming tho report of the
death of ' Howard was re
â l at th* War Department from Gen
eral Otis to-day:
MANILA. Oct 23. -Captain Guy Howard as
sistant Quartermaster and quartermaster of

Klvor by concealed lnsurpents. His clerk

This morning Kline, commanding; at Palam
ba, vigorously attarfced insurgent foroe con
cÂ«ntratlng on nil front, routed them from tne
heard. Denials may be expected, as a
p of course, but I do not hesitate
to repeat on high authority that the
British navy will not be used against
Germany in" the Levant and that this is
the secret understanding which has re
leaei d England from all risk of German
investigation in South Africa.
Certainly, Germany is not the quarter ,
from which England has suspected that!
some sudden attack might be made, and
consequently has ordered preparations
for war on a larger Scale than the cam- I
palgn with the Dutch burghers has jus- j
tlfled.
The channel squadron will not sail to j
the Mediterranean on account of any i
German menace. The relations of Eng
land and Germany are most cordial, and
the Emperor's visit next month is a plain
Indication that for practical reasons he j
onclled to a policy which enables
â 'â  ritish Government to reconstruct
its Dutch republics and to bring them
r the authority of the crown.
England and Germany are acting to-Â»
gether in the Pamoan negotiations, but j
not to the disadvantage of America. In
deed, Germany's policy is now directed :
toward the establishment of the most i
! relations with America as well as
England. General Harrison, who with his
wife dined last night at the House of
Commons with Mr. Balfour to meet the
rs in English public life, would be
d witness for this point, for he was
entertained by the Emperor at Potsdam
and by the Gt-rman chancellor at Berlin.
The "moral effect of the earliest victories
was invaluable. Private as well a- news
ind official dispatches- certify to the
â  ment of the Cape Colony Dutch and
the estrangement from the Boer cause

INSURRECTION AGAIN
BREAKS OUT IN COLOMBIA
Revolt Started in the Department of Santan
der and Is Rapidly Gaining
Headway.
â¢ WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.â A cableg ram has been received at the State Department from United States Consul #
â¦â¢ Gudger at Panama, stating that an Insurrection has broken out there and that martial law has been declared. +
Mr. Gudger's cablegram was to the effect that the departments of Cundimamarca, Totima and Santander are in Â°
o insurrection, though the city of Panama proper is as yet unaffected. The State Department has already called upon q
4- the Navy Department for a gunboat to proceed to Panama or some near-by port. The Marblehead is now on the west +
O coast, and if it can be reached it is probable she will be ordered to go at once to Panama. o
â¦ On the Gulf side the Detroit is nearest, being at La Guayra, and if the conditions in Venezuela are regarded as +
Â° warranting het^withdrawal she will be sent across to Colon. O
A dispatch sent to the State Department from United States Minister Hart at Bogota informs the State Depart- "Â£

O KINGSTON, Jamaica, Oct. 23.â Advices from Colombia announce the commencement of a revolution there with o

*â  COLON, Oct. 23.â That the revolutionary movement in the republic of Colombia Is general Is indicated by disturb- +

STATEMENT MADE
BY STEUNENBERG
Assumes Responsibility
for the State.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Oct. 23.â Chalrmrm
l>uk of the Republican State Committee
has received a copy of a letter written
by Governor Steunenberg of Idaho under
â¢ r 10 to Secretary of War
Root, in which the Governor assumes for
I the State full responsibility for all that
has been dune In Shoshone County in con
nection with the Cover d'Alene mining
trouble. The letter was written volun
tarily, it is said, by the Governor, on ac
count of the criticism which has been
made of the Federal Government Gov
ernor Steunenberg says:
"While It is not necessary to inform
you of the relative positions of the State
of Idaho and the general government in
the matter, as this status is clearly de
fined by statute, still it may be proper for
purposes of general information to add
that the Suite of Idaho is responsible for
all that has been done in Shoshone Coun
ty relative to the call for troops, the ar
rest, detention and care of prisoners,
the regulations under which the mines
Â« an and lave been operated from the time
insurrection up to the present time,
the regulation of all matters con
ng the employment <>f men in these
all of the above matters having !â¢'â¢ 1
the immediate supervision, control
â  ;' the officers and repre
sentatives of the State of Idaho and not
in any way of the Federal troops. I
further Plate that the State of Idaho as
sumes and acknowledges all responsibility
for the manner In which the affairs are
icted In the Cour d'Alenes so long
rtlal law, as proclaimed, prevails.
"It .-â liould be stated here, however, that
these men (the prisoners) have not been
under or by reason of indictments
upon the part of the State, but because
they were men whom we could not permit
;,, be a! large under the present condi
t affairs in that section. The men
who were held under Indictments found
by the State Grand Jury and whom we
to try, escaped prison a few days
â  the regular term of court, at which
time all preparations had been made to
try them."

The defendants are charged with inter
fering with the running of a United States
mail train and conspiracy at Wardner on
April 27 lust, when tho Hunker Hill coal

CUSTODY OF THE PRISONERS.
Governor Seeks to Hold Federal Gov-
eminent Responsible.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23. â Governor
I Steumnberg of Idaho had another confer
| ence to-da.v with Secretary Root respect-
Ing the maintenance of Federal custody of
the miners who are now held as prisoners
in Idaho by the troops. The War Depart
ment is anxious to escape the responsibil
ity for th* further care of these prisoners.
On the other hand, Governor Steunenberg
â¢ ai not see his way clear to accept their
custody, because he has not sufficient force
to take care of them. Secretary Root has
| suggested that the Governor issue a call
for a special session of the Legislature to
deal with the question. Meanwhile the
War Department will continue for a short
: time at least to hold the prisoners
Secretary Root on September 2S wrote
Ito Governor Steunenoerg, protesting
I against the further employment of
United States troops to guard the prison
ers, saying:
"I am informed that they are now being
used by the civil authorities of the State
and county as a guard for certain prison
! ersâ upward of a hundred in numberâ
> who have been arrested by the civil au

YOUTHFUL HIGHWAYMEN
BEHIND PRISON BARS
a / 1 \HREE small boys Implicated in the supposed juvenile highway robbery
+ " I at the corner of East and Merchant streets, about two weeks ago, have
O 1 been landed behind the bars. The lads' names are, Stephen Smario,
+ I aged 10, of S22'i Vallejo street; Joe Govoni, aged 14, of 224 Vallejo street,
O "*â¢ and Peter Grata, aged 10, of 322 Vallejo street. When arrested the boys
â¼ all admitted having been present when young Johnson lost his eye and young
? Smario says he wielded the weapon that did the damage. The boys will not
J say that It was a case of attempted highway robbery, but young Johnson per-
slsts that the youngsters now under arrest Injured him while they were
O deliberately holding him up in an attempt to take his money from him.
4 There were eight boys in the crowd. The other five will be arrested as soon
O as the officers can apnrehend th^n. The lads left town immediately after the
â¦ affair, fearing arrest, and returned a day or so ago.
? On the afternoon of Sunday, October 9, Sam Johnson, 16 years old, who
â¦ arrived from the Klondike with his father two months ago, was passing
along East street, when he was stopped by a gang of boys. Johnson claims
O that one of the boys, who proves to be "Mickey Murphy," residing at 915
+ Preecott place, rode a horse and cornered him in a doorway while the re-
O mainder of the crowd surrounded him. They then demanded money and on
â¦ being told that there was none for them to have they set upon the boy and
Â° beat him with clubs and pieces of gaspipe. : Then young Smario struck John
o son in ; the eye, necessitating its removal later The surgeons declared that
a knife had been used in injuring the eye.
O The boys' story is that Johnson attempted to take the horse from them
> when they beat him. Smario claims that he struck the boy with a piece of an
o iron hoop. The trio were taken to Central Police Station, where their names
â¦ were placed on the small book. They were placed in care of the matron and

the meantime, unless something is done
to prevent it, these prisoners would re
main in prison under guard of the troops
of the United States.
"I do not wish anyway to make any
suggestion relating to the administration
of justice in your State, or to imply that
the failure" to bring these prisoners to
trial has not been for perfectly good rea
sons in accordance with the law and prac
tice of the courts of Idaho, but I am
much disinclined to have the troops of
the United States continued longer in the
attitude of retaining in custody the citi
zens of a State who have remained so
long without being tried, and I feel bound
to urge that if Tt is not convenient to
bring the prisoners to epeedy trial you
will substitute civil guards as their cus
todians and relieve the troops of the
United States from further performance
of that duty."
Tho reply of Governor Steunenberg, un
der date nf October 10, asserts that the
withdrawal of the troops would surely
result in a great loss of property and the
I loss of life in that vicinity.
"Covert threats," the Governor adds,
"are constantly being made by those who
engaged In the riot of April 29 tha^as
soon as the troops are removed they will
gratify their revenge upon those citizens
who have b'en induced to assist the State
in the attempt to ferret out crime, and the
history of that region convinces me that
these are not idle threats.
"It should be understood that this Is
not a conflict between capital and labor,
nor a question of wages, but it is a con
flict between the State of Idaho and cer
tain criminal organizations which seek to
cloak themselves under the cover of la
bor organizations. We are not in con
flict with organized labor, as such, in any
way whatever.
"At the present time in the Coeur
d'Alene quiet apparently prevails, but it
is solely by reason of the presence of
the Federal troops. A large number of
theso parties who were in the riot of
April 20. it is true, have simply gone
across the line to Butte, Mont., and to
British Columbia, and will return imme
diately upon the removal of the troops.
Upon "their return there will be inevitable
j conflict, which in my judgment will re
'â â  suit In much bloodshed,
"In concluding my answer to this por
tion of your letter, I will say, that in my
judgment the necessity still exists for the
detention of troops in the Coeur d'Alenes,
and 1 ask that they be permitted to re
main to assist us In policing the situa
"As to the guarding of prisoners, I will
| state that on November 1 the State will
i be able to relieve the troops of all such
duties This has been our desire- from tho
beginning and it has been our intention
at all times to perform this service as
soon as we could, and we have done so,
I in so far as it was possible."

NATIVES OF
GUAM HOSTILE
Leary Appeals for Re
inforcements.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.â Natives of
Guam, that Interesting Island in Ladrones
which became the property of the United
States by the terms of the Spanish-
American treaty of 189S, are causing
trouble to American authorities there.
Captain Richard P. Leary, U. S. N., Govl
ernor of the island, has sent an urgent
request for reinforcements, and the Navy-
Department and the brigadier general
commanding the marine corps to-day is
sued orders for augmenting the Guam gar
rison by a battalion of marines. Several
sections of this additional force, 350 men
in all, will leave various stations for San
r rancisco as soon as possible. They will
sail thence for Guam on army transports
Information as to the details of the
trouble in Guam are not obtainable. The
natives of the island were credited with
being peaceable. They appeared to be
glad of the change of government, but ac
cording to advices from Governor Leary
they have developed a hostile attitude to
the Americans and are not as peaceable
as was supposed. Their number is not
great enough, however, to excite any ap
prehension in official circles as to the
ability of the United States marines in
the island to maintain order.
This change in sentiment or develop
ment of hidden feeling may be clue to the
Spanish influence that prevailed and per
haps still exists In the island. There was
a small Spanish garrison at San Luis
d'Apra, the principal town, when Captain
Henry Glass, commanding the cruiser
Charleston, which was convoying the
army transports City of Peking, Aus
tralia and City of Sydney, sailed into its
harbor June 20, IS9B, and made the Span
ish Governor and his subordinates prison
ers of war before they wore able to
understand that hostilities had com
menced between the United States and
Spain.
This Spanish force of six officers and
fifty-four enlisted men was taken a way on
United States ships to Manila, but wheth
er any of its members returned to Guam
after peace was declared is not known
hero. Some of the enlisted men had fami
lies In Guam and may have gone back
there to live instead of availing them
selves of the privilege of being trans
ported back to Spr in at the expense of
the United States.
Orders were sent also by the Navy De
partment to-day for the dispatch of an
other battalion of marines to Cavite a
naval station near Manila. These orders
are the outcome of a request from Ad
miral Watson for marines to serve in the
island of Cebu.

EUROPEAN CRISIS
NOW IMPENDING
Powers May Profit by
Transvaal War.
NEW YORK, Oct. 23.â A special to the
Journal from Washington says: The
State Depa-tment a few days ago instruct
ed Its diplomatic and consular officers
throughout the world to send daily re
ports of the international situation as it
develops. The War Department sent sim
ilar word 'to the military attaches in
European countries and the Navy Depart
ment communicated the same instruction
to naval attaches abroad. Reports have
arrived daily since. The State Depart
ment is convinced that a European crisis
Is Impending. The indications are that
not only will an offer of mediation in
the South African war be made by Ger
many, France, Russia, Italy, Austria,
Belgium and Holland, but on rejection of
such an offer an "identical note" of in
terrogation will be sent by these coun
tries to Great Britain asking as to her
ultimate purpose in South Africa, is it,
after the Transvaal and Orange Free
State are conquered, to establish a great
South African-British dominion?
With no satisfactory reply forthcoming
the powers will push Great Britain in
diplomatic channels and make demonstra
tions at various vital points. The indi
vidual purposes are as follows:
Germanyâ For absolute control of the
Samoan group and an extension of her
Chinese concessions, as at Kiaochau and
Shanghai.
Italyâ For Sun Mun Bay, China, and a
foothold in interior China.
Russia â For paramount influence in
Northern China, an outlet in the Arabian
Sea or Persian Gulf and concessions from
Turkey which will make her influence
felt in the Mediterranean.
Franceâ For an extension of possessions
in East Africa with a view to encroach
ments on British possessions there and
regaining some of her lost prestige in
Egypt.
Austriaâ To share with Russia in con
cession from Turkey.
Great Britain and the United States
have an understanding whereby the
former will secure all her supplies in
this country and the United States will
refuse to participate in an offer for media
tion, or in the interrogation as to Great
Britain's ultimate intentions in South
Africa, or in any subsequent joint action
of the powers, and will agree to preserve
status quo in Samoa; to preserve integrity
in Shanghai concessions and prevent ag
gression in any direction or quarter where
the United States has material interests
at stake.
The State Department Is evidently pre
paring for some official development, for
it was permitted to become known to-day
that the powers prior to the Spanish
war were preparing an identical note of
interrogation as to our ultimate Intentions
in the war.
SUIT AGAINST
A RAILROAD
Water Front Rights of
Eureka Involved.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EUREKA, Oct. 23.â An important suit
was filed to-day in the Superior Court in
which the city of Eureka is plaintiff and
the Eel River and Eureka Railroad de
fendant. The action is brought to set
aside the franchise granted that corpora
tion by the council that went out of offica
January 1. Â«
The complaint contains serious charges
against certain members of the old coun
cil. The Eel Kiver road has already laid
tracks along the whole water front, and
if the city is bested in the suit will control
the whole commerce of the bay.
The franchise is asked to be annulled
and the tracks declared a public nuisance
on the grounds of fraud; that the Eel
River road has no right to extend tha
road from Its present terminus at the foot
of A street; insufficiency of publication of;
the franchise, and that the Council did
not comply with the law in granting the
franchise in that it was not put up for
sale.
On the result of the case depends
whether the city will be deprived of the
whole water front, worth many thou
sands of dollars, and whether the Klam
ath railroad shall be allowed to enter tho
city. The case promises to be bitterly
contested.
Kobbe to Be a Brigadier.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 23.-The appoint
ment of Colonel Funston to be brigadier
general of volunteers filled but one of the
vacancies in that rank caused by the or
ganization of the new army. One more
vacancy remains to be tilled, and it wag
said at the War Department to-day that
it will be filled by the promotion of "Major
William A. Kobbe of the Third Artillery.
Major Kobbe is now in the Philippines
and has greatly distinguished himself,
and has been mentioned on more than
one occasion for conspicuous bravery.
When it was determined to raise the first
ten volunteer regiments he was named
by the President as colonel of the Thirty
fifth Volunteers. His promotion to brig
adier general will result in the promotion
of Lieutenant Colonel Edward H. Plum,
mer to a colonelcy.
Not an Incendiary Fire.
OAKLAND, Oct. 23.â The detectives
who were put to work on the Dingee flra
when it was supposed that the place had
been set on fire for the purpose of rob
bery, have practically closed their Investi
gations and have decided that the fire was
not incendiao'- The opinion is general
that the flames originated by the crossing
of electric light wires.

THE CHARTER SUSTAINED.
AT last I gle over the new charter
is at an end. It has been approved by the
. ratified by the Legislature and con-
Supreme Court. It has been sub-
â  trial known to our laws and
has been upheld at every test. All doubts as to its
:;>ated. The new charter is to
be the organic law of the city and the affairs of the
administered in accord with
â¢ s by the officers who are to be elected
this :
Jh< iurt will be received with gen
eral gratification. Years have passed since the ef
in to obtain a charter com
mensurate with the needs of the city and framed in
c with the popular desire, and thousands
en expended in the various at
tempts to obtain one. It would therefore have been
a serious loss to the community had the Supreme
Court found the new instrument defective in any
particular or invalid upon any ground whatever.
By the decision the atmosphere has been cleared
of the last lingering opposition to the charter. The
avenues of municipal reform, improvement and
progress provided by it are now open and secure.
The one duty that remains to the people is to elect
officers who will wisely administer the powers which
will be theirs when placed in ofrice. That is the issue
of the campaign. The charter is secure and now let
us make good government under it equally secure by
electing men who are to be counted on to apply it
with wisdom, public spirit, economy and civic
patriotism.
For some time past certain Democratic politicians
and papers have claimed the charter as a Democratic
production. The claim has had no foundation in fact
and has never deceived intelligent citizens, who are
aware that when submitted to the vote of the people
the charter was sustained by votes cast in Republican
districts and was ratified by a Republican Legisla
ture. All that, however, is now out of the question.
The decision of the Supreme Court takes the char
ter out oNthe domain of controversy and makes it
the constitution of the municipality, the law of the
whole people. Nothing but demagogy can attempt
to make it a partisan issue and none but the dupes
of demagogues will be misled by such attempt!.
Miss Jane Dwyer, a local medium, has complained
to the police that some person sent her through the
mails a box of chocolate creams loaded with blue
!, with the evident intention of poisoning her. A
chemist, who examined the poisoned candy, says
there was just enough bluestone to make a gooll
emetic, and the police are now of the belief that a
business rival of Miss Dwyer was taking this means
of making her yield up some spook secrets.
The policy of expansion is making an insidious
progress in every direction. Two very estimable
citizens of Sacramento have discovered that the town
is not big enough for both of them and now one pro
poses to carve or club or shoot the other. The pro
posal, at latest reports, had not been accepted.
A dusky but charming representative of deposed
South Sea royalty, who Is among us, says that the
title of Queen or Princess never troubled her. She
neglected to add, however, that it created all sorts ot
a row among other worthy and well-meaning people.
The inconvenience of relatives has again been
strikingly demonstrated. The Emperor of Germany
is afraid to visit England because the world might
think that he is sympathizing with his grandmamma
in her war with the Boers.
lount chief of the Basutos has been get
. into print a great deal of late. That's the way
with those paramount fellows ever since Blount's
time.
THE TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION.
WE have called attention to the organization of
the mercantile interests of this coast in a
Traffic Association, which promises to co
operate with transportation interests in such way as
to protect the coast trade by giving it stability.
The Eastern jobbers have long sought to locate
the distribution of our trade at any point most con
venient to them, east of the mountains, From such
point they desire to reach the retail trade here direct.
To this end they have sought to powerfully impress
transportation, to force such a rate on less than car
lots of merchandise and to secure such changes in
classification as will enable them to add to their posi
tion of wholesalers at home the advantage of being
peddlers here. From its beginning they have sought
to put the Interstate Commerce Commission in a
hypnotized atmosphere, hoping that it would see
nothing but distributing points East, and West noth
ing but a country to be distributed to, clear to the
Pacific Ocean.
It has not been altogether an accident that this
coast has had no representative on that commission.
None of the present members comes from this side of
the Missouri. Mr. Youmans of Sioux City is called
the Western member, and if he represent us he has
almost the world for a parish, and his parishioners
see but little of him.
It should be the aim of the Traffic Association to
co-opetate with the railroads in securing a Commis
on this coast who sees through coast eyes
and interests. We use the word co-operate advisedly
and with deliberation. The interests of commerce
will not be served by the appointment of any man
who sees in railroads the sum of all villainies nor the
sum of all virtue-. He should be a man who ex
pect? to find Western transportation, overland and
local, alive to the fact that it has interests in common
the coast production and distribution.
The railroads want to have the business of mer
chants, not of peddlers. To do this they want all the
advantages of the fourth clause of the interstate com
merce law, which protects the ton per mile rate on
the long haul, for our overland roads have the long
est haul on the continent. These roads are at pres
ent in a position to aid in making Pacific ports the
jobbing points in Asiatic trade. By water we have
an advantage of from 5000 to 7000 miles in that trade
over Xew York. While this advantage subsists there
is no reason why we should not be permitted to add
to that the land mileage of 2500 miles to Chicago, or
3500 to New York, and so carry that trade from
here. Even then we bring its Asiatic source nearer
to New York by combined water and rail than she
. water alone.
So, instead of parting with our distributing trade
to our own population and turning it over to points
East by converting railway trains into peddlers'
wagons, we should control legitimate wholesaling
orce.
It will be observed that the very title of the Traffic
Association combines trade and transportation in a
common interest and a common effort. Transporta
tion is concerned in that increase of population
which comes with a symmetrical development of all
the factors of an American community. Where pro
duction, transmutation and exchange are all in proper
operation, labor of all classes, skilled and unskilled, is
in demand, and business ability, in wholesale, jobbing
and retail lines, and in finance, is profitably employed
and the whole community is built up.
There is no evidence that the overland railways
have any desire to restrict or destroy their present
coast terminals. They need on the Interstate Com
merce Commission a sympathetic mind which can see
the necessity of differentials to the commercial life
of a region that has a long haul on its freight. Again
the Traffic Association, by frank contact with trans
portation interests, has it in its power to protect trade
from that curse and scourge of commerce â railroad
rate wars. Whenever they have raged commerce
has been paralyzed. Rates made by roads in these
struggles are in their very nature unstable and
threatening of change. When they fall below the
cost of the traffic they imply a reaction for recoup
ment of the resulting loss. The unthinking rejoice at
a rate that loses profits to a railroad, while the mer
chant groans in spirit at a condition that he cannot
control, but which threatens his ruin. What com
merce needs is equal service to all at an equal and
fair rate, which is not subject to erratic change.
A Traffic Association which covers the coast from
Puget Sound to San Diego and sits in council at the
terminal points of every overland railroad can exer
cise a powerful influence for stability of rates and the
resulting stability of commercial conditions. Now it
is a supreme necessity that we have from the region
covered by this Traffic Association an Interstate
Commerce Commissioner who knows the character
and conditions of our trade and who notes keenly any
respect in which our mercantile rights and interests
are outlawed, either by the law itself or by the prin
ciples upon which it is administered.
The Governor is waiting, the dispatches say, for
public sentiment of the State to crystallize into a de
mand for an extra session. If there is one thing
in the State which above all others Gage is known
not to represent, it is public sentiment.
A COMMERCIAL MUSEUM.
SO much has been said throughout the East of
the wonderful work which has been accom
plished by the Philadelphia Commercial Mu
seum and the men who maintain it that it seems well
assured such institutions are among the most bene
ficial a commercial community can establish and sup
port. Out of the museum there has come to Phila
delphia a great export exposition and a commercial
congress which was in every respect the most im
pressive nf its kind that ever assembled. That much
has been achieved for one city, but the wider effects
of the museum have been felt in all the larger Eastern
cities and have been everywhere noted and appre
ciated.
In his address at the Commercial Congress ex-
Senator Edmunds described the work of the museum,
he being a trustee of the institution since its organi
zation. In the course of his speech he said:
"It is not a private corporation; it is not a body of
gentlemen associated for gnin, nor a State or na
tional organization, but it is an international
organization, . whose purpose and design and
whose work have been devoted to the increase of in
dustrial commercial intercourse among all nations.
It has gathered in its museums year after year the
products of almost every clime, and the manufactures
of almost every country on the face of the globe, be
ginning with the simplest raw products, in order
that her artisans and producers of manufactured
goods could see where they could obtain the advan
tages and the best means of developing their indus
tries and products through the aid of our brethren in
every other country who are able to produce things
that our climate would not produce. * * * It has,
also, samples of the products, raw and manufactured.
of our own people of every description and kind, that
our brethren of other countries could perceive what
THE SAN ERANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1899.
we could do and make comparison for mutual inter
change of products. It has established besides that
what in a short term is called the Bureau of Informa
tion. Its scope is much larger than that â it is an
encyclopedia of all the commercial relations on the
globe."
Not long ago a movement was started in this city
to establish a commercial museum here, and it was
announced that the officers of the Philadelphia mu
seum would co-operate with the enterprise. It is to
be hoped the undertaking will be pushed while the
success of the great organization in Philadelphia is
still fresh in the public mind. This is a good time
to begin anything that tends to promote commerce
and a commercial museum is certainly of that nature.
The British press had to join in the chorus of
"Hail, Columbia," when the American defender beat
the Shamrock. Pretty soon they'll be adopting
"Yankee Doodle" as the British national hymn.
IN his campaign Mr. Phelan plays on a harp of
many strings,* and is in danger of wearing some of
them out. He continues to accuse the Repub
licans of treason, and of being enemies of the people^
and at the same time begs of them to vote for him
and to bolt their own ticket. The present Board of
Supervisors, with a Republican majority, has not
waited for the new charter, but has instituted some
commendable reforms, and thereby stands in marked
contrast to its predecessor, which was largely com
posed of men of Mr. Phelan's selection. But he
denies that the present board is entitled to any credit
for its reforms. He, Phelan the Mighty, forced it
to be a reform board! He has recently fallen into
torrid praise of Mr. Joseph Britton, his Republican
supporter, and so far the only one publicly known.
Phelan praises his age, calls him "the Grand Old
Man" and other pet names. Age is a merit in men
who support Phelan, but an offense in men who op
pose him.
In his speech in the Twenty-eighth Assembly Dis
trict on the 18th inst. he said: "This is not the days of
'49. Republicans bring out old men from the past.
We are not old men."
It is really to be hoped that Mr. Phelan's intended
reforms do not contemplate disfranchising old men,
or having them knocked in the head. These whom he
calls old men and sneers at so flippantly had the man
hood to marry and rear families bearing their name
and the genius and courage to lay the foundations of
our institutions. Mr. Phelan himself is descended
from their class, unless he intends to go back to the
Greek myth and declare himself self-creative, or like
Topsy insist that he "jes' growed." These old men
at least had the energy to earn their own fortunes
and to create the conditions in which Mr. Phelan,
without any self-exertion, became and remains a mil
lionaire.
It is a wonder that he does not order the Bear flag
torn down, the State seal battered and everybody
older than himself sent to jail for the high crime and
misdemeanor of age and experience.
He is singularly given to the division of the people
into classes. He first divided the people into Demo
crats and traitors, the latter being Republicans who
will not bolt their ticket and support him. Now he
divides them into Democrats and old men, the latter
being those who do not support him and therefore
are denounced as Forty-Niners, who, of course, ought
to die out of Mr. Phelan's way and let him run things
on a strictly anti-'4Q basis.
Mexicans and cowboys along the Arizona and
New Mexico borders seem to be making fairly good
targets of themselves. As long as they confine their
pistol practice to one another there will probably be
no serious objection to the game.
SIR THOMAS LIPTON, who bears his de
feat with an equanimity that commands the re
spect of all, announces that he will challenge the
New York Yacht Club for another contest for the
America's cup in 1901, and will at once set about de
signing a craft to make the race. In the meantime
he has suggested to the New Yorkers the advisability
of taking the Columbia to Europe next year and
assures them if they do the Shamrock will try her
again.
There is nothing in the suggestion that implies dis
content with the circumstances or the terms under
which the races were held off Sandy Hook. It
means no more than that Lipton has carried into
yacht-racing something of the vigor which has
marked him in business, and he doesn't like to stop
while a loser. He evidently believes in his boat, and
while he purposes to build a better one if British
skill can do it, he would like to give the Shamrock
another chance to win while the new boat is being
constructed.
Whether the Columbia will be taken abroad next
year will, of course, depend upon many things. There
may be circumstances which would render such a
course inexpedient. It would be gratifying, however,
to the American public to have her go over and give
the Shamrock a trial in the Shamrock's own waters.
It has been a notable victory to defend the cup at
home, but it would be a greater victory still to meet
the best yachts of Europe over the famous yachting
courses in European waters and bring other cups and
trophies to attest her invincible superiority over
every craft of her kind the Old World can furnish.
The extent to which Lipton is ready to go to win
the America's cup is shown by his statement that the
cost of the Shamrock alone, without including the
expense of her crew or anything else, was about
! $500,000. The new yacht he intends to order will
certainly not cost less. His expenditures therefo-e
will far exceed the million mark and his yachting en
terprises will have to be included among the largest
in which he is engaged.
If the construction of yachts ended with racing
such expenditures would be anything but commend
able. The beneficial effects of the contests, however,
are far reaching. Just as horse racing has led to the
improvement in the breeds of horses, which have
given us the splendid horse of to-day, so the racing
of yachts has led to improvement in the construc
tion of nearly all kinds of sailing craft and has ma
terially stimulated seamanship. The vast sums ex
pended for yachts therefore have not been wasted.
Shipbuilders have learned from the contests some
thing which has been of advantage to commerce and
to industry.
One reason given by Lipton for desiring the Co
lumbia to cross the ocean is that she would teach
Europe a lesson in yacht-building. He is quoted as
Faying: "I sincerely hope she will cross the Atlantic
j if for no other purpose than to show them over there
J what a Yankee yacht is like. You can take my word
for it she would sweep everything before her." Such
appreciation of the merits of our boat shows we have
a foeman worthy of our most generous rivalry, and
it is to be hoped the Columbia will be taken across
i the seas next year to meet her old rival and all other
j yachts that dare to enter a race with her.

to undertake a line of profitable study and
to stimulate and direct their efforts in pur-
suing it to an advantageous end.
Your plan has the merits of some of the most
popular educational movements of the day â such

The subject matter of your courses has been

not be of any value, for it would not be
anything upon which to base any calcu

The average in particular localities can
be furnished, as. for instance, in San
Francisco the average of the rain of fifty
seasons is 23.01; the heaviest during any
year was in 1884, when it reached' 38.82,
and the lowest was in 1898, when it was

THE SAN KRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1899.
WILL SEE PRESIDENT
WHEELER INSTALLED
PROF. D. C. GILMAN OF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.
PRESIDENT DANIEL COIT OILMAN' of Johns Hopkins University ar
rived !n this city last evening from his home in Baltimore, and is now
nt The Palacp. accompanied by his wife. He comes to witness the formal
Installation of Professor Benjamin Ide Wheeler as president of the Uni
versity of California, which ceremony is to take place next Wednesday after
noon on the Berkeley campus.
President Oilman will witness nothing new in the ceremonial, as he him
self was at one time president of the same institute of learning, serving
from 1!>72 to 1875, resigning during the latter year to accept the position at
the head of the great university over which he has ever since ruled.
Upon his arrival President Oilman was met at the Berkeley station by
President Wheeler and at the Oakland mole by Regent Hallidie, and by
both of these gentlemen escorted across the bay and to his hotel. To-day he
â¢will leave for Berkeley, where he and his wife will remain as the guests of
President and .Mrs. Wheeler as long as they stay In this part of the State.
When seen In his apartments last evening President Oilman proved to
bo a dignified, courtly gentleman, whose chief characteristics were his great
personal magnetism and his pleasant willingness to extend courtesy to his
visitors.
He spoke of a pleasant trip across the continent and of the plans he and
his wife had ma v a short vacation, which embraces a two weeks"
stay in the vicinity of. San Francisco and then a trip to the southern part
of the coast, where they will put In a similar length of time resting and
enjoying themselves. Their subsequent movements have not yet been defi
nitely settled, but they will probably return home via the southern route.
Presidi nt Oilman refused to express his views on the question of annexa
tion, as he said he was reserving them lor his speech next Wednesday, when
they would be fully exploited.
The head of Johns Hopkins University was born at Norwich, Conn., in
lsr.l. He graduated from Vale In 1852, and then spent several years In fur
ther study attending lectures at various seats of learning in this country
and then going to Germany, where he graduated from the Berlin University.
He Has received many honors and has been proffered many public posi
tions, and is at present a member of the Venezuela Boundary Commission.
President Oilman is also an author, and two of his works in particularâ his
"Life of President James Monroe" and "Introduction to Democracy in
America"â have succeeded in placing him among the foremost literary men
of this country.

IOWA BOYS' RECORD
IN THE PHILIPPINES
The Fifty-first lowa, the last except
the First Tennessee of the volunteer reg
lments to return from the Philippines
Ss had an experience that fell to the lot
of none of the others. More than one
third of the whole time since they left
here has been spent on board of a trans
port-ninety-three days on the Pennsyl
vania going out and thirty on the Sen
ator returning. The regiment arrived In
San Francisco on June 9. 1898, and after
being three times disappointed finally
got away for Manila on November 3, ar
riving there December 6.
The Hollo expedition was in expectancy
and the regiment was kept on board the
ship with a view of sending it to thai
place, for which it Bailed on December
V, The men were not disembarked thr>re,
however, but returned to Cavlte on Jan
uary 31 and disembarked on February 5,
having been continuously afloat for three
months and three days, during all of
which time there was not a single death
and but two men sick in the whole regi-
m They went into camp at Cavite and
Colonel Loprr was put in command of the
district. On February 8 they took part
in the capture of San Rogue and in the
sharp fight of the 35th, but lost no men.
On February 18 Major Duggan was
ordered with the first battalion to the
south line below Manila, near Pasay.
There they were on constant duty and
in much sharp lighting until March 28,
when they were withdrawn to Cavite.
On April 16 the entire regiment joined
Mac Arthur's division at Malolos by way
of Malabon, and were assigned to Hale's
brigade. From that time until the end of
the campaign their movements were
Identified with those of the brigade. They
were under fire fifteen times, and the
casualty lists will tell the story of their
battles and losses.
At the capture of San Fernando the
lowans charged across the river in the
face Of a heavy fire, and driving the en
emy before them were the first to enter
the burning insurgent capital. When
withdrawn from the front the regiment
had but 218 men fit for duty out of the
1020 enlisted men and fifty officers. Fifty
one were invalided home, forty dis
charged at Manila and seventy-one men
and two officers revolunteered, leaving 769
men and forty-nine officers to' return.
The regiment never set foot in Manila
until It was ordered home. Altogether It
has had a unique experience.

COUTH EXPOSED
TO SHAME IN A
DIVORCE COURT
His Wife Secures an
Absolute Decree.
Benjamin A. Curtaz has been divorced,
his Buffering wife being granted an abso
lute decree upon the ground of his shame
less Immorality and infidelity. Superior
Judge Daingerfield, before whom the
wife's suit for divorce was tried, granted
her an absolute divorce, awarded her $125
a month alimony and gave her the cus
tody of the two minor children, Benjamin
F., aged 5 years, and Albert H. Curtaz,
aged 4 years.
The testimony in the c;ise will not bear
repeating. Jt was sufficient to prove every
allegation of the wife and to reveal the
husband as out; false to every vow of
married life and dead to every principle
that men of honor respect.
Witnesses were summoned to the stand
to tell the story of the husband's of
fenses in many places and at many times.
The disagreeable story traced the shame
less husband from house to house, in the
city and out of town and back again into
his very home in his violation of the vows
that decency alone might have made him
respect at his own fireside. Hotel pro
prietors, servants and lackeys told the
story and linked the name of the derelict
hu.sband with that of a woman known as
May Schribner, who figured in the com
plaint aa co-respondent.
This concluded the testimony of the
witnesses summoned to substantiate Mrs.
Curtaz's charges and the plaintiff was
then cailed to the stand. In a gentle tone
of voice she told the court the story of
her sufferings, tmd said that she had al
ways tried to bo a true and devoted wift
and could find no excuse for her hus
band's shameless actions. She said that
nftor her return fram Oakland she was
unaware of her husband's degraded ac
tions until the woman in the case calltd
him up by telephone. "I insulted her,"
bald Mrs. Curtas, "and then my husband
flew into a rage and left the house." At
this point Judge Daingerflold interrupted
the proceedings by asking that the prayer
of Mrs. Curtaz's complaint be read, which
was done, and without delay the court
f ranted Mrs. Curtaz the desired relief.
Irs. Curtaz then spoke up and asked the
( ourt to make an order preventing Mr
Curtaz from ccmlng to the house after
dark to see the children, and also begged
that the court make an order decreeing
that Curtnz was not to take the children
(.lit of the house- unleps accompanied by
one of Mrs. Curtas' a friends. "My reason
for this," said Mrs. Curtaz, "is to pre
vent my husband from taking the chil
dren to that woman's rooms, as 1 know
he has done In the past." The plea was
granted and It went on record that Ben
jamin A. Curtaz, vice president of the
firm of Benjamin Curtaz &, Son, had so
reached the depths of degradation that

IMPORTANT RULING IN
THE FAIR WILL CASE
Judge Troutt Sustains Mrs,
Nettie Craven's Demurrer.
In Addition to Hastening the Hearing of
Her Petition His Opinion Opens Up
Questions of Probate Law.
THE fighting chances of Mrs. Nettle
R. Craven-Fair for a slice of the
millions of the late Senator Fair
have not only been Increased by a
ruling made yesterday by Superior
Judge Troutt. but, if his opinion is
good law, questions of probate long since
considered settled will undoubtedly arise
to torment heirs and make fat fees for
lawyers.
Judge Troutt's ruling: was made as part j
of the proceeding on "Mrs. Craven-Fair's
petition filed some time ago for a family
allowance of $5000 a month, pending the
determination of her claim to widow
hood." To this petition the Fair children
âMrs. Herman Oelrichs, Charles Fair and
Mrs. W. K. Vanderbllt Jr.â filed an an
swer, in which they Eet up that Mrs. !
Craven was estopped from claiming heir
ship by the decree of partial distribution
granted In April, 1597, by Superior Judge
Slack, In which the decision was reached
that the next of kin and sole heirs-at
law of the late James G. Fair were the
' three children. To this answer Mrs:
Craven-Fair's attorneysâ W. W. Foote,
Pence & Pence, Judge Denson and A.
Rupfâ demurred. Arsniroentu on thp dp
murrer by Pence & Pence for the peti
tioner and Charles Heggcrt} and \\ . S.
Wood, for respondents, were concluded
last Friday and the demurrer was bu
tained yesterday by Judge Troutt, who
holds that the question of heirship can
only be finally determined either upon
the granting of a final decree of distribu
tion or by a special proceeding, which
cannot be brought within less than a
year after the issuance of letters of ad
ministration.
"In the first and the second 'separate
answers' set forth in the amended an
swers of the children of decedent to the
petition of Nettie R. Craven-Fair for an
allowance to her as the widow of de
cedent," says Judge Troutt in his opinion,
"they claim that the decree of partial
distribution, made within five months
after the issuance of letters testamen- j
tary on their application, estops her from
claiming to be the surviving wife of de
cedent, for the reason that she knew of j
such application, and that In said decree
there is a recital that said children are I
the sole heirs of decedent.
"The aforesaid contention of decedent's
children is, in my opinion, unsound; for j
I take the view that on the hearing of
the application for a partial distribution
the court had not the power under the
statute to determine who were all of the
persons entitled by law to share In the
final distribution of decedent's estate."
Continuing the court said:
Proceedings for the administration of the
estates of deceased persons and for their
distribution to those who may be entitled
thereto. Including the determination of the
heirs of the decedent, are purely statu
tory. The Superior Court, while sitting a3
a court of probate, has only such powers
as are given It by the statute, and such
Incidental powers as pertain to all courts
for the purpose of enabling them to exer
cise the Jurisdiction which is conferred upon
them. Although It Is a court of general
Jurisdiction, yet In the exercise of these
powers Its Jurisdiction Is limited and spe
cial, and whenever Its acts are shown to
have been In excess of the power conferred
upon It or without the limits of this special
Jurisdiction such acts are nugatory and have
no binding effect, even upon those who
have invoked its authority or submitted to
Its decision. The statute permits the ques
tion of heirship and the rights and Inter
eats Of all persona to be determined only
upon the final distribution of the estate
(sees. 1634 and 1665, C. C. P.) or after the
lapse of one year from the Issuance of
Letters Testamentary. (Sec. 1664, C. C. P.
In re Oxarat, 78 Cal., 109.)
Mrs. Craven and her attorneys were
highly pleased at this quick turn of af
fairs," as it allows them to proceed at
once to trial to establish her claim of
widowhood, without the necessity of go
ing to the Supreme Court, as they would
have been compelled to do had the de
murrer been overruled on this point.
"The effect of Judge Troutt's ruling,"
he would take his babies into the home
of a woman whose actions prove her to
be among the last among women with
whom innocent children should be allowed
to associate.

found hanging in Jail this morning. The
unfortunate man had applied for admit
tance to the County Hospital about mid

created such a disturbance that the
Shasta officers were sent for, who placed
him in jail. He was evidently insane.
Brown Is In town.
said W. W. Foote, senior counsel for Mrs.
Craven-Fair, "will be that we will now
proci ed to try our action to determine
the widowhood of our client in the pro
ceeding for family allowance. That is
set, 1 believe, for the l'oli of next month.
If th'- court had ruled against us we could
not have k"Hc- on with that action until
after we bad secured a reversal from the
Supreme Court. That would have taken
a great deal of time. This decision of
Judge Troutt hastens matters wonder
fully."

Monday crowd attended the races to-day.
The track was In good .condition and the
â weather was fine. With the exception of
the 2:15 class trot and the mile and a
sixteenth spiling race, the favorites got
tha worst of It. but a." they were almost
prohibitive In the booking-, the talent was
not "hard hit."
The 2:16 clans trot attracted lively In
terest, and Neert-ta, the favorite from
mart to finish, carried off first money.
Dr. "-<\s?=e took the first heat In this race,
but Neereta won the next three heats
without apparent effort.
In the rive-furlong sprint the bunch of
seven got away to a straggling start and
"Windy Jim. with Joe Webor up, captured
lirst money from Tanoka by a short head,
Alas, the favorite, being a close third.
Amafa was a 3 to 10 favorite in the
thrfo-cjuarter mile event and was well
played in the books. He pot the best of
the start by over a length and held the
position into the stretch with Yule a close
second. Jerid then forged ahead and In
a driving: finish won the race, beating
Yule by a neck and Amasa by a short
length. At the three-quarter post Peter
Weber broke a don in his left hind
leg and dropped out of the race.

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 23. -Joe Choynski, the
â¢well-known California boxer, knocker] out
Dick Moore of St. Paul to-night in the
arena of the St. Louis Athletic Club in the
third round of what was to have been a
twenty-round contest. Choynski was in
-id fettle, and after the first round
imply played with the St Paul boxer
Moore, too, was in good condition, but this
availed him nothing as against the su
perior science of the Californian. Choyn
ski had the advantage in height, reach
and weight, bul Moore was plucky and
took a hard beating like a stoic, in the
first round Moore carried the fight to Joe
at every turn, and forced him about the
ring with rights and left to the body
Choynski used a stiff left jab which
Jarred Dick badly. In the second round
Joe had his man sized up, and after a
rapid exchange, sent Dick twice to the
floor with rights to the jaw. Moore aro=e
and made a vicious effort to retrive his
laurels, "the round closing with both men
exchanging h:trd blows at close quarters
The third round was all In Joe's favor.
He outpointed his opponent at all Htagos
and put him down thn-e times in succes
sion with right-hand punches on the jaw
Moore was game, though groggy, and
managed to regain his feet twice within
the count, but while assaying to do the
tri<k a third time was counted out by the
referee, Tim Hurst.
As a curtain-raiser, Tommy Hogan of

"BILL" LANGE RETIRES
FROM THE DIAMOND
"BUI" L,ange, the debonair and hand
some ball player, is home again, and now
that he is on his native heath he vows
he will never appear on the diamond
us^ln. The news of this solemn pledge
has caused an infinite amount of sorro-w
among the "fans," who' swear by the big
holder. The secret of Lange's reason for
quitting the fascinating and to him re
munerative pastime has long been known;
he is going to be married.
Nothing will shake his determination to
stujj playing. "Pop" Anson tried to keep
him in the game with offers of increased
salary, as aid also a number of other
managers; but "Bill" was obdurate. He
is desirous of adapting his talents to other
pursuits, and unless he proves a failure
he will nevi-r don a baseball suit again.
It was hoped that. he would give his nu
merous friends a last opportunity to see
him perform with some of the other ex
perts when the present California League
season closed, but they are doomed to
disappointment. They will only have a
recollection of a skillful fielder, a daring
base runner and a heavy batter.
Lange was born in San Francisco In 1871
and lived here the best -part of his life.
He first became known as an amateur
ball player of ability in 1890, and soon
after that went to Port Townsend, Wash.,
to visit his brother. He then played with
the Seattle club of the Pacific Coast
League and when that organization broke
up joined the Oaklamis of the California
League. His work attracted the atten
tion of President Hart of the Chicagos,
and in 1893 he joined the Anson colony.
It is not generally known that he is a
collegian, but such is the case, he having
been a student at the University of Cali
fornia. Last spring he coached the Stan
ford University students with great suc
cess. He rejoices in a number of nick
names, among them being "Big Bill,"
"Little Eva" and the "Port Townsend
Boy." II' 1 Is extremely popular, both on
and off the Beta, is unmarried and the re
cipient of more "mash notes" than a
handsome actor. He is a man of careful
habits and should have a long, successful
athletic career.

DAIRY QUARANTINED.
Inspector Rowland Finds Sanitary-
Conditions Very Bad.
PASADENA, Oct. 23.â Dr. Ward B.
Rowland of this city, the newly appointed
State Dairy Inspector for Southern Cali
fornia, is finding- an astonishing state of
affairs, which makes it seem incredible
that there has been no dairy inspector
hitherto. Though Dr. Rowland declared
some time ago that he would not accept
the appointment, because the territory
and work assigned to him is beyond his !
powers to properly attend to, he has !
nevertheless declared war and is work- i
ing to rid the country of disease-breeding i
conditions which exist In the milk sup
ply. A few days ago he found the I.X.L.
Dairy, near Tropico, several miles west
of here. In an astonishing condition. He
says that from ten to forty head of cattle
had died of Texas fever. The doctor ex
hibits a tick about half an inch long that
he took from one of the cows.
"The proprietor of this dairy." said the
Inspector, "has simply let things get in
a horrible condition. I found carcasses
in the hog corral and back of the barn
in all stages of decomposition. The
Gash
stench is sickening. I saw cattle roaming
about sick with Texas fever." The dairy
has been placed under quarantine.
TEACHERS' INSTITUTE.
Annual Session of the Instructors of
Glenn County.
WIT/LOWS, Oct. 23.â Pursuant to the
call of Superintendent of Schools F. S.
Reager the ninth annual session of the
Glenn County Teachers' Institute con
vened to-day at Willows. Fifty-three
teachers, representing the forty-three dis
tricta of Glenn County, met to discuss
methods, exchange ideas and us fur as
possible solve the problems which
confront them in their daily routine of
schoolroom work. Among those who will
address the teachers are Bernard Moses,
Ph. D., University of California; C. C.
Van Liew, president of Chlco State
Normal; State Superintendent of Public
Instruction T. J. Kirk, and Miss Kate
Am<'S, ex-superintendent of Napa County.
After a three days' session the institute
will adjourn to \KmL Bluff, where it will
meet the teachors of this part of the
Stuto in the fourth annual session of the
Teachers' Association of Northern Cali
fornia, and again, on somewhat brnadf-r
lines, examine questions appertaining to
the profession.

METHOD OF REVENGE EMPLOY
ED BY THE MONGOLIANS.
O:;t::Tnl Trade Valued at Half a Mil-
Dollars Annually Was
Taken Away From His
Firm.
A few days r.go a Phelan evening or
ganette sr>ecrlnf, r iy said that Horace Davis
lost his flour tr:>'le in efforts to gain
cheap political capital. Since Horace Da
vis in battling for the workingmen of
San Fra::icseo sustained great pecuniary
losses it is well to bring out the facts
to the shame of the helan subsidized
prep*. "When the true history is told the
workingroen of San Francisco will place
a still higher valuo on the character and
public services of [on. Horace DavK
In 1!*.3 Horace Davis perceived the dan
per of Chinese immigration to California
and In a letter to the New York Tribune
sounded the note of alarm. He was not
an eleventh-hour convert to the cause "f
the workingmen of this coast, but was
one of the first in the field t<> protect his
fellow-workers from the dangers of Asiat
ic Invasion.
In iB6O .Mr. Davis, who then owned the
largest flour mill in th State, opened
the Hour trade of the Orient and in the !
course of sixteen years succeeded In es- |
tablishing a larpp'and profitable business.
The traÂ«le expanded and he exported an
nually one hundred thousand barrels of
ilour.
In 1576 Horace Davis was elected to rep
resent the San Francisco district In the
Congress of the United States. He wast
fleeted by the votes of the honest work- i
t rs of this city ;:nd in Congress was faith
ful to the cause of the people. There in j
opposition to the advice of New England j
friends he resumed his battle against the ;
introduction of Chinese labor, realizing ',
that white workingmen could not compete ,
with the' low-nald contract labor of Asia. ;
He did nor pause to consider the cost.
!!â¢â > fought for a principle and that prin
ciple was the protection of American la- j
bor. He was warned that if he did not
withdraw his opposition to unrestricted '
Chinese immigration he would lose his
Oriental trails. Men who battle for the
cause of human betterment are not
swayed or Influenced by motives of per
sona! gain, so Horace Davis, true, then as '
he i* now tn tho worklngme of San !
Francisco; falteied i ot in the discharge i
â¢>t duty, but continued his active battle j
against the influx of the Chinese.
Finding that threats were of no avail j
the Chinese Six Companies; acting on the i
advice of Consul Rep. took away the flour !
trade which Mr. Davis had developed!
during the preceding sixteen years. It \
was a business estimated at a half million I
dollars; Five hundred thousand dollars is !
it considerable sum of money. Phelan I
never earned one five hundred thousandth i
part of that sum. Mr. Davis did not In- !
h"rit this vast volume of business from â 
his ancestors. He inheritel only the en
< riry. the honesty; the enterprise, the in- '
dustry and the good common-sense to de
velop the business". He won the trade by
honorable commercial achievement and i
sacrificed it rather than falter in his tight i
for his fellow-workir.emen of this city and !
State. Th-^ Phelan .subsidized pr^ss j
ppeak of this sacrifice as a loss sustained j
by Mr. Davis in efforts tn make cheap po- !
i litlcal capital. Phelan ought to be i
. ashamed to address an audience of work:
ingmen.
'.THIRTY-FIFTH DISTRICT.
The hall at 3295 Mission street, where i
the ratification meeting of the Thirty- !
fifth Assembly District was held last j
night, was packed with an enthusiastic ;
and representative audience. Every
available space of the large auditorium
was occupied and many ladies were pres
ent, who entered into the spirit of the
occasion quite as much as the men who
were- present, and were Quick to observe
when any telling point was made by the
various speakers.
Promptly .it the hour of â  o'clock the j
Hon. Horace Davis appeared upon the j
scene, and as his familiar form came up]
the .-tails lending to the hall he was
greeted with a roar of applause and an I
outburst of cheering that fairly raised the
roof. The me:: and women assembled:
waved their hands as he was escorted to j
the stage by Sheldon Kellogg 1 ; and Chair- <
man F. AY. Warren introduced him by j
I,'L.adles and gentlemen: If straws are.;
an indication as v. which way the wind i
blows 1 am constrained to introduce you i
to the nest Mayor of this municipality;
Hon. Horace Davis."'
Thore was a repetition of the first en
thusiastic reception; which lasted at least
two minutes.
After the noise had subsided Mr. Davis
in an earnest. for< eful manner b'.gan to
discuss the issues of the present cam- j
paign, and it was easy to see from
the unstinted applau.se with which he was j
greeted during ins speech that he quite j
won the confidence of the larÂ«" audience I
â a confidence he has at all times enjoyed i
in this community.
Mr. Davis expressed himself as in j
hearty accord with the platform adopted
by the Merchants' Association, which
meant so much for the material advance
ment of the city.
"The. Alerchants' Association," said Mr.
Davis; "favors the placing of wires una r- j
ground, continuing the present street- i
cleaning system, better street pavement \
and salt water for sower flushing; in a
word, the beautifying .if our fair city so
that it will rank with the best cities in
tho nation. In addition to all this l would j
put the city in v. sound sanitary condi
tion so that it would ue healthful to live |
here".
"I think the municipality should be run ,
ori pound business principles just a - well
us any other business concern. The pco- !
j'!'- are interested in knowing how the i
money in expended and I believe in letting i
I b. -Sieve in the city owning its own
water supply and would advocate that as
one of the necessary improvements. In
regard to the other public utilities the
people can decide for themselves if they
want them to be controlled by the munici
pal government.
"In all thos-> matters I desire to state i
that I am perfectly independent. I do
not own one 1- share of stock in the gas,
electric or street car companies and i do
not possess a single bond in the Southern
Pacific Company; so you Bee that I am ;
free to act for the good and welfare of
this city; in which 1 have always taken !

justiiles your confidence In me then I '
think that I am entitled to your support ;
at the coming election. The Republican
ticket as nominated Is a good, Bound, sub
stantial ticket and deserves your confi
dence. As for th<; Board of Supervisors
I was privileged to aid In the selection
of the candidates and I assure you that â 
they are the best men that were found !
available for the positions. It is the best
ticket that has been placed before you ill
twenty years*.

without hard work. We must endeavor to
persuade the men who have gone away
from us to return to the fold where they
belong and once more bo Republicans as
they were of old. All I ask you to do is
to organize and let every man buckle
down to work earnestly, sincerely; stead
ily, patiently, so that when the Bun goes
down on 01-cction day the news will go
throughout this vast country that the Re

MISSION REPUBLICANS:
A large and enthusiastic audience greet
ed the many speakers at Teutonia Hall,
on Howard street, last night. The Re
publican voters of the Thirty-first Assem
bly District turned out in full force ana
listened attentively to the speeches of
candidates. Great receptions were ten
dered to Horace Davis, the Republican
candidate for Mayor, and Colonel T. V.
Eddy The many other nominees were
also* 'well received. H. J. McMahon,
president of the district club, presided
and introduced the first speaker of the
evening in the person of Colonel T. V.
Eddy, who said:
The signal gun has been fired and the battle
brgJns in earnest tonight. The ,i decision

Â« on ushered in Â»v a battle royal to deride the
mon' important election ever held In San Fran

tnVreHUlt' 15, it will have a great effect on the
next State and national campaigns.

a?alMt any party principles. The Republican

RnUed States well Into the Pacific Ocean, an.l if
there 1- a city that ought to be In favor of the
, 'ii'v of the* present administration, that rlty
Is San Francisco. If her commerce continues to
pxn-fnd as it has In the past few years there
will not be enough shipping or railroad facili
ties to handle that commerce. Stick to that
principle that says that Americans shall make
what Americans use. and that the price thereof
JhÂ»ll be paid to Americans instead ot being

this Is the man I'helan denounces as a traitor.
Democrats say that Republicans are not
friendly to tho charter, and also say put no
one but th" friends of the charter on guard.
Do they Know that the charter Was made DOS
sible by a Republican legislature, signed by a
Republican Governor and carried on election
day by the voters of the Republican party?
The same can be said of the primary law, and
I now declare that if the voters of San Fran
cisco owe any political party any debt for the
same .they owe It to the Republican party.
Gentlemen, remember that it la your duty on
next election day to bo to the polls and vote
the Republican ticket from top to bottom.

point of his pen with which to record
that comprehensive, or meaningless,
whichever way you take It, shrug.
Maitre Bert was proceeding to get out
of it all the satisfaction possible for
his client, when Maitre Barnard asked
leave to withdraw Comte long enough
to get In the testimony of the physi-
lans who had treated him. Permis
sion was granted and Dr. Charles J.
McCarthy took the stand. The doctor
said he examined Comte four days
after the encounter and found him suf
ferine from a fractured nose and con
tused eye. On cross-examination he
said he had examined the eye again
hist Friday and found that the sight
was cone from i;
"Do not the medical books, doctor,"
asked Bert, "give numerous Instances
of cases where people who are i.liud
of one eye do not disci that fact till
the other is injured?"
The doctor replied in the affirmative,
saying also that it was possible that
Comte might have been Win 1 ot his
left eye at the time be was struck by
( 'â¢' au.
Dr. James F. Smith testified in a
similar strain, although he was not so
certain that Comte was blind in the in
jured optic.
< '"mi' was placed on the stand aga:n
a: d Maitre Bert resumed his cross-ex
amination. His questions were put
with a view to eliciting answers from
the plaintiff that the injuries to his eye
and nose had not interfered with his
attention to business. Comte shrugged
and shrugged and exhibited the palms
of bis hands, but. refused to have It
that way. At last he let out a flood
of French.
"For a month," the interpreter said
he said. "1 was so ugly that I was
ashamed to have anybody look at mo."
M. Comte nodded assent at the in
terpreter's translation, and turned his

court ordered an adjournment till this

Brannan, last night and listened to Mayor
Phelan' s speech on the new charter, the
Democratic administration and other in
ter.-sting thoughts from a score of candi
dates who were seeking votes.
The Mayor was In good voice despite
the fact that he had spoken at two other
meetings earlier In the evening. Once
started on his now familiar lines he im
pressed his auditors with his worth as an
and paid beautiful tribute to Mr.
1 Nidge, his ihart and a number of other

He told of the harmony that existed in
the party at this election and excused
former conflicts by saying that like the
waves of the sea. they an In constant
agitation and thus keep it clear and pure
The Mayor told of the attempt being
made to draw him Into a discussion of
the currencj question, expansion and
other national issues, but said this was
a municipal campaign nnd only local is
sues should be touched on. He raised
his voice to a higher pitch and said;
"Let then wait until next year and
we will give them a light on those lines"
Me then dwelt on the new charter and
told of Its beneficial effects. He in
formed his auditors that under Its pro
tecting folds they had redress by peti
tion to the Heard uf Supervisors Instead
of waiting until their term had expired
lie claimed that the charter did not vesi
the Mayor with autocratic powers, but
simply placed in his charge the responsi
bility of appointing different officials and
if such appointees were not true to their
trust he could remove them at will.
He tailed attention of the transfer of
power from the Governor to the Mayor
and the value thereof. He said the Gov
ernor heretofore had the appointment of
many officers, and if they were distaste
ful the people had to grin and hear it.
As on other occasions he paid his re
spects to the chief executive of the State
declaring that Governor Cage had been
brought from the south and had proven
a monumental failure as an officer, lie
regretted Mi.- fan that MagUire was not

Democrat would have paid more atten

The Mayor made an earnest appeal for
re-election.

The Democrats of the Forty-fourth As

Washington Hall to greet th^ir nominees
and cheer for th< ticket. There was no
lack of enthusiasm even aftor a .store ot
tiresome addresses had echoed through
tli- hall.
Kmiii Pohll was the first speaker of the
evening and gave an assurance that every
man who stands upon a platform of hon

Drydock â New Boats
Being Built.
A big fleet of vessels made port yester- '
| day. Many of them had been off the Far- |
| allones for days and took advantage of
| the favorable wind and sailed in. The
j sugar fleet was well represented, and
! about the last of the Hawaiian crop la
now â in port. Several coal ships arrived
from Newcastle, Australia, and Swansea,
and a couple of schooners from the far
north also put In an appearance.
Among the arrivals were the b,arks
Martha Davis, Andrew Welch and Dia-
I mond Head; barkentine V,'. H. Dimond,
J brig Consuelo and ship Falls'of Clyde,
from Hawaii; ship Alex Gibson from Bal
( timore, ship Lord Cairns from Swansea
; and ship Helensburgh from Newcastle,
Australia. .Of the sugar fleet the brig
i Cunsuelo, from Mahukona, made the best
j run, coming up in seventeen days. The
W. H. Dimond made the passage In
eighteen days, while the Falls of Clyde
was nineteen and a half and the Martha
Davis twenty-four days.
The Alex Gibson is commanded by Cap
' tain Holmes, formerly of the Charmer.
I This is his eightieth time of rounding the
' Horn,, and he says that the longest time
:he ever took to get from 60 to 59 was
twenty-one days, and that was due to an
accident to one- of the masts. On this
i occasion Captain Holmes brought the j
! Gibson from 50 in the Atlantic to 50 in
1 the Pacific in eleven days, and says he
never had the topsails in during the en- |
! tire run. Captain Holmes was here last
in the ship ( banner, but when she was
sold to W. IS. Mighell and others for the
I coast trade he went back East and was
appointed to the Alex Gibson.
The British ship Lord Cairns made the
j run from Swansea to San Francisco in
i 131 days. She encountered three storms
during the run, but none of them di I ,
much damage. The Cairns made the run
from 50 to 30 in ten days and, like the '
i Gibson, was detained outside for two days
I by light winds and calms.
Another vessel that got in from Sydney,
i N. S. W., was the British tramp Pathan.
j She comes here with a cargo of coal, and
1 as soon as it is discharged she will be
â  fitted out as a transport. The Pathan
I made the run from New South Wales in
â¢ the good time of twenty-six days. The i
j schooners Luisa D and Louisa J. Kenny
j arrived from the frozen north. The Luisa
< D came from Cape Nome in twenty-seven
clays and brought down forty-three gold
j hunters, while the Kenny had been on the
I Siberian coast on a trading cruise, but
i stopped at ('ape Nome and brought down!
' twenty-nine gold hunters. Among the
! Luisa D crowd is a party of thirteen
, from lowa, who bought and fitted out. the
! schooner last spring. They have done
i fairly well and are going back to Nome
I next spring. During the voyage home
i Charles Hough died from general debility
! and was buried at sea.
j The Louisa J. Kenny was fitted out on
j Puget Sound and has been some time in
: the Arctic. She brings back 7000 pounas
! of whalebone ant! eighteen bear skins. On
I putting in at Cape Nome Captain Everson
' found a lot of miners who wanted to get
I out of the country, so he brought them
I down. The men on the Kenny and those
lon the Luisa D say that typhoid fever
j is prevalent at Cape Nome and that many
' I deaths had occurred. An exodus was on
I and all the steamers will come down with
j crowds.
1 The schooner Jennie Griffen arrived
1 from San Diego yesterday. She used to
j run between here and Point Reyes, but in
1 i June last started on a cruise to Southern
j California. She left San Diego forty days
i ago, but went to the guano islands and
' i brought up twenty-five tons of fertilizer.
; John Hyslop, the Merchant Exchange
! reporter at Point Lobos, did some good
1 I work yesterday. He made out the col
i lier San Mateo when she was thirty miles
; off shore. She was from Nanaimo for
1 Port Los Angeles and has been out Jive
days, being delayed by the heavy weather
that made the Walla Walla late. Hyslop
1 also made out the collier Bristol when
she was twenty-five miles off shore and
a "square-rigger" when she was thirty
-1 live miles away, which afterward turned
out to be the Helensburgh.
The steam schooners Ruth and Luella
! had an interesting race down the coast
â  from Coos Bay. The Luella won the race
, by a comfortable margin. She was bar- :
! bound at Tillamcok for nearly a month
i and had to discharge her cargo in order
â j to get out. The work of getting her
ready for a trip to Eureka will be rushed â 
â  night and day and she will sail to-morrow
â¢ morning. :-"-. -V :â -â¢'
There is now Hearing completion . in
â¢ Turner's yards. Benieia. a schooner for
; the Tahiti trade, an auxiliary schooner
for the Hawaiian interisland trade, a pas
â¢ senger schooner for the Carolines and a I
: schooner for the French Protestant Mis
sion in the Marquesas and Tahiti.
A new four-masted schooner is being
â  built at Coos Bay for Captain James H. |
. ! Bruce and others. She will be 700 tons
i burden, 190 feet long, 39 feet 8 inches
' broad and 14 feet 6 inches deep. She will j
1 ! be ready for service in June, 1900.
The big four-masted bark Arthur Sewall
i | went on the floating dock at the foot
,Of Spear street yesterday. She is the
largest' vessel that has ever been on the
| dock and attracted a great deal of atten- !
â  tion in consequence. The dock hands had
: not the least trouble in handling the big i
I ship and when, safely on the float she '
only extended over the end about twenty
feet. The Bewail goes on the dock for a
'< general overhauling and painting. In j
about thirteen of the plates some riveting :
will have to be done and then the largest !
American ship afloat will be ready to load i
a general cargo for Europe. ,

I holders and discuss with them the
policy which shall be enforced for the
I next two years. The ever tiring but never
1 abandoned story of the creation of the
| charter was told for the twentieth time.
! Another fling was taken at the office
i holders who sought to test the legality of
I the new organic law and the Mayor in
sisted that the very men who fought the
; charter are now seeking to obtain office
under its administration as the law.
His Honor says that all his enemies are
enemies of the charter and lie wants the
people to punish them at the ballot boxes.
He says the Republicans want to keep
San Francisco in her swaddling clothes.
These men, he declares, are the men of
the days when the water came up to
Montgomery street. They are Silurians
and dreamers and do not know what a
splendid prospect Dewey's victory opened
;to the city. The Mayor's party is the
party of progress, ready to place the city
in debt to build schoolhouses, make the
city sanitary, construct sewers and erect
â  public buildings. For these reasons and
i for many more, which his Honor deems
very good votes are solicited for the Dem
ocratic ticket.
Just as the Mayor concluded Assessor
Dodge and his charts entered. The band
; must have seen him. for the strains of
"We Won't Get Home Until Morning,"
i blared through the hall. The other speak
ers of the evening had absolutely nothing

foanfnns hut. Yielding to a strong predi-
lection for painting
on the part of the
son. he was placed
in the studio of his
uncle. Lorenzo Alle

painter. Here ho

Oorreggio. I/ombardi

Carreggio studied
philosophy,

question ns to who
was Antonio's actu
al master in paint
ing is as problemati
cal as many other
facts, personal and
artistic, concerning
his career. The Idea
supported by Ri^'i.
and apparently rho
most probable. is
that he studied with
Antonio Eartolotti,
or Bartolozzi, at this
time head of the
school of art in Cor

a pupil of Francesco

would gladly welcome the fart if
we could find it. of Allegri's contact with
the great art spirits of his day, but thus
far authentic sources of information hai c
failed to tell up of a single great painter
in that great period of art whom he per
sonally knew, and it does not appear that
he ever was in Rome. Away from the
great art centers, then, this heaven-born
painter acquired an all-sufficient knowl
edge of his craft. Tt mattered little what
thome presented itself or what he was
commissioned to do, his ready brush
made sport of itâ too much sport, indeed,
at times, for canons of cathedrals and
Benedictine monks. Thf-se monks com
; missioned Correggio to decorate the cu
pola of the Cathedral San Giovanni
Evangelists, a.t Parma. Allegri was of too
joyous a nature to be deeply solemn, ami
in .this vision of St. John in his old age.
"The Ascension of Our Lord." he ]â¢<;â â -
i sented the apostles in too unconventional
i a manner to give complete satisfaction
to the authorities who commissioned him.
He departed so far from tradition in this
painting as to represent these holy men
nearly destitute of clothing and reposing
on don. ls in most froe and unconstrained
| attitudes. Below them come the even
gelists, each acompanied by a father of
the church. A frieze divided by four win
dows, encircles the dome, and that part
| which is beneath each evangelist con
tains his emblems intermingled with boy
angels and flowers. These boy angels
play an important part in many of Cor
| reggio's frescoes. They rollick in wild
i est gambols over the whole space, and in
the "Coronation of the Virgin," only a
I part of which now exists, their antics are.
! if possible, more audacious than those of
< the dome, rs they are practiced even
j among the robes of the principal figures.
The irresistible gayety of his point of
view did not make of our artist the ideal
religious painter of his day; but. despite
i his lack of the sentiment of dignity and
\ solemnity in work of this character, we
find him in a method of composition cmi
'â  nently fitted for the treatment of re
-1 Ugious themes. For by his practice of
foreshortening from the point of sight
of the spectator he seems to do away
| altogether with the dome, if It be a dome,
! and to open to us, In its place, the blue
' vault of heaven, filled with figures float
ing upward in a sea of radiance, and In
supply was exhausted the candidates re
freshed them with thoughts on the new
charter "good government" and other
things political. The hall in which the
love feast was held was barren of an
American emblem, no room being had for
the stars and stripes, as Mr. i'helan's
flags covered every bit of space. Despite
this omission, many of the candidates
grew patriotic. Horns were furnished the
members early in the evening to blow an
acclaim for the victory of the new charter
when the candidate for Mayor put in an
appearance. , _
The instructions of Chairman Oscar
Hocha were disregarded, however, tor
whenever a popular candidate mounted
the platform or made a point he was
greeted with a blast, so that when Mayor
Phelan did arrive the possessors of horns
had little wind left to voice their enthu
siasm Not so the candidates. Thfy

a month, and they helped swell the noisy
greeting to 'the .Mayor.
When quiet was obtained Mr. Phelan
felicitated on the decision of the Supreme.
Court Ho regretted that that body was
composed of a majority of Republicans,
but added thai he always liked to remove
the thought of politics in that august
body He said the Republicans were tak
ing credit for the charter by reason of the
fac.l that a Republican Legislature had
passed it and the Republican voters of the
city had voted for it. He took some credit
for himself in the matter and also told of
its being a Democratic Instrument, as it
expressed the will of the people. The
Mayor took a fling at Horace Davis for
not answering his letter, in which he had
called "that courteous gentleman" a trai

Superior Lodge.
Superior Lodgr of the Ancient Order of
United Workmen gnvp its first jubilee en
tertainment and hall last night At 1605
Polk street, and it was one of the most
enjoyable entertainments that has i>> en
given in the Western Addition this Bea
son. The cozy hall in which it was given
was crowded with members of the order
the very postures In which they would
appear from below. Such powers, serious
ly used, could noi but uplift the mind \t
expended on sacred themes; but Correggio
waa a kind of pagan, rejoicing, exultiiig
in light and life for their own sakes. Ths
very perfection of this method of fore
shortening had also its faultsâ the Im
pression from below, as It would be in
nature, was sometimes confused. This
appears in the case of the "Assumption
of the Virgin, " with which he filled the
largo dome of the cathedral. Here hun
dreds of figures seen from below, boldly
foreshortened, produce their eflect. In the
hands of this master, mainly by the play
of light and shade on the different groups.
Still, a number of figures ascending

(Pronounced Kor-red-jo.)
would not seem u> must advantage from
beneath, and the feeling of the chapter
of the cathedral and Â«>f the public re
garding this dome was a 1 first one of dis
nt. Tiiis was the general condition
of public sentiment when, as tradition
tells us, the mason':- boy exclaimed that
the new paintinj sembled
a dish r.f frogs. I' would thus a]
that the general lmpr< ssion of the forma
above their h< similar to that
received from their own favorite dish of
frogs, at which only th.- hind legs were
Berved. This saying became celebrated
perhaps by its giving expression to the
unuttered thought of many others. It was
not, indeed, until Titian passed through
Parma, in the suite of Charles V, ;
that the existence of this beautiful work
was placed beyond jeopardy. The canons
of the church had about concluded to
have it all effaced. Titian, on seeing- the
dome, said: "If you Tilled it with gold
you would not have paid what it is
worth." This saved the painting, but it
did not reinstate the painter in the re
gard of the people, for it is a fact that
for half a century after Correggio's death
his- reputation in Parma failed to receive
full justice.
To secure this truthful effect of fore
shortening he made use of small models
in clay, as of course the living model
could not be expected to retain such atti
tudes. These, it is said, were made for
him by a friend. Religious painting was,
however, not his choice, and tiring of mis
apprehension Allegri gave up the jremain
ing commissions on the cathedral, re
turned to his native town of Corrcegio
and devoted the rest of his short life of
not quite forty years to the production of
subjects from mythology.
Many madonnas bearing the name of
Correggio are in the various collections
scattered over Europe, but many of them
are of doubtful authenticity. The origin
c.f most of il;< Be was a demand, often
: ignorant, for "Corres;K T i f >s." In the eight
eenth century, which demand the dealers
undertook tv supply. But in spite of the
harm this fact lias done his fame, the
strict test to which his works are now
ected is clearing the way more and
more for an unreserved admiration of
this happy genius who peopled cupolas
and canvases with glowing Images and
i left behind him in his brief pilgrimage a
path of light.

EASTERN MARKETS
AYtv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 23.â The market gave con
vincing evidence to-day of a substantial growth
of bull sentiment In Wall street. The dealings
took on more appearance of animation than at
any time since the violent downward course
of prices, when the money situation first be-
K an to awaken anxiety. Dealings were very
well distributed in that almost every depart
ment of the security market was represented
In the advance. Handsome grains in prices
were achieved In many prominent stocks and
In a large number of cases the last prices were
the best. In other cases : rout-taking made
notable inroads upon the day's highest prices,
n'ui some effort was obvious in sustaining the
market in the closing dealings. It was a
notable feature of the market also that while
a number of members of a distinctive group
of stocks would show great strength and ac
tivity, other members ol the same group, seem
lnfely dependent on the same intiuences, would
remain quiescent and almost immovable. Thus
while Louisville and the Norfolk' stocks ad
vanced vigorously, other conspicuous Southern
lines of railroads were lite unaffected. Again
while the grangers also as a rule were strong
nud active, Northwestern scarcely moved, and
Pacific stocks, including Southern Pacific, show
ed very slight response to prevailing strength.
The New York, Chicago and St. Louts stocks
were subjected to rather palpable manipula
tion, the first preferred rising an extreme
eight points and the second preferred six
points. New York Central was also vigor
ously bulled to a maximum price of 140. The
high-priced specialties, including sugar, to
bacco and People's Gas, nnd the local traction.
tt!n-kf>. were all quite aggressively strong.
The largest activity was in the leather stocks
and the buying In them continued until the
close, the common crossing 19 and the pre
lt-rred touching SI. This enumeration includes
the most conspicuous instances of strength,
There was at the same time a notable back
ward movement In Pullman, Laclede Gas and
Anacondaj which show net declines respec
tively of J j, C and 2 points. American Malt
ing and one or two of the iron and steel stocks
also reacted and Glucose Sugar preferred drop
ped 3 i-oints In spite of the strength of the
common stock. How far the day's strength
was due to covering hj- the short Interests,
which common credenr-e places at still larger
proportions, it would be difficult to say. The
public h.id little to do with to-day's rise. But
professional operators of a large caliber took a
conspicuous and confident part in the market.
The continued downward course of sterling
exchange affords relief from all apprehension
of good exports. But no prospect Is diseern
able of easier money conditions. Call money
to-day was suffer at 6 and 7 per cent and time
loans for all periods again came back to 6 per
cent. Exchange continued to move In
favor of the interior as against New York.
Recent large expenditures by the Government
hhow a declining tendency and thus threaten
a renewed drain on the New York banks In
taking up the Government surplus. To-day's
movement of Ftocks demonstrates how com
pletely the money outlook was Ignored. There
was very heavy buying of Green Bay income
"B's" at an advance of 2%.
The bond market was moderately .active at
advancing prices. Total sales, par value

Â£3,000,000 by treasury bills, suggesting that
there will be no new taxation at present. This
announcement came late In the afternoon.
Consols touched 104"* and closed at 104.
Americans were firm, about parity, till New
York operations caused a sharp rise. Rapid
fluctuation* followed, but the eloping prices
were near the best of the day. The most ac

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Oct. 23.â heat opened strong '
and active. Complaints of damage by drouth
j in the Southwest and higher Liverpool cables,
notwithstanding the downward tendency of the
i market here for the last week, caused the
j change in sentiment. Buying was heavy from
j the outset, and as offerings were scarce the
market soon got above call figures. Profit
taking and selling by holders of privileges
caused a slight reaction after 4c had been
added to the opening advance, but as corn had
begun to show decided strength shorts became
anxious and ran to cover. Outside buying
hastened the upturn that followed and the
price tended upward the remainder of the sea
sion, the market closing strong at the best
price of the day. A smaller increase in the
visible supply than expected and liberal clear
ances helped to maintain the advance. De
cember opened a shade higher at 69% ( 570c, ad
vanced to 70%<\ sold off to 70Vic and advanced
to 70-'<i^70 T sC at the close.
Corn started strong and kept improving a
little right along until within half an hour
from the close, when profit-taking checked the
advance. Reports of poor yields and a large
decrease in stocks, coupled with the heavy
current requirements of both foreign and do
' mestic consumption, was the basis of the mar
kefs strength. December closed at 31%^314c.
Oats ruled quiet and the advance was due
almost entirely to sympathy with corn. De
cember advanced to 22i 4 (T;22 T iic at the close.
Higher prices for hogs and a good cash de
mand strengthened provisions. The advance
in corn was a further encouragement and a
moderate gain was easily established. Janu
ary pork closed 74'??10c higher, January lard
and ribs 2W higher.

Chicago was firmer on steady cables, the \
strength In Corn and small offerings. The I
crowd was short and bearish, however, . and
the rally war not expected to hold. The mar- i
ket lacked support, and the timid shorts were
I nil covered. Statistics were too bearish for
; an advance, though the 1.260,000 bushels in- !
] crease In the visible supply was less than ex
< pected. The world's shipments for the week ;
were 8,500,000 bushels. At the close there was
a better tone in all markets. Corn leading.

The non-arrival of one steamer and weather
delays to others up north keep supplies of But

steady In consequence. Dealers say, however,
that when the northern steamers do get In the
market will probably weaken off.

adopted yesterday provided that the cost j
of. the improvements proposed was too
great to be paid for out of the ordinary
income of the city government. The im
provements proposed were as follows: I
That tho panhandle of the park be ex
tended easterly as far as Van Ness ave
jiue; that Golden Gate Park be extended
northerly between Thirteenth and Four- j
teenth avenues, to connect with thy Pre
sidio reservation; that funds be provided ,

that a general sewer system be provided j
tor; also a new City and County Hospital;

The reports of the committee appointed

new City and County Hospital were
opened ami read. Dr. J. R. Lame and
William Watt Kerr reported in favor of |
the plans drawn by Martens & Coffey.
Dr. < '. N. EUinwood submitted a separate
report, but was In favor of the same
hiiects. He qualified his choice, how
<â '. <-r. by suggesting that one-half of the :
spital buildings be erected on the Alms
)i'iu-e grounds, the other on Rincon Hill.
]>r. KHinwood also spoke highly of the
plans ut" Havens & Toepke and Shea &
tSheo. The Supervisors are at a loss to I
between the plans of Shea & Shea !
and Martens it Coftey. Roth are excel
lent, but the committee reported in favor .
of the latter firm and it is likely that the
award will be given them. On motion of
Supervisor Holland the f election of the
uhs was referred to the Supervisors
sitting as a committee of the whole at
the lv^xt regular meeting.
Thd motion made by Supervisor Black I
to rescind the ord< r prohibiting the dis- I
play of banners Â«n the public streets was j
finally disposed of by indefinite postpone I
ment. At the last meeting Black moved I
to amend the original order by providing I
that banners might be strung on any j
s-treet excepting Market and Kearny
str.-vis. Holland moved to indefinitely !
postpone, but his motion was lost and ho i
leave notice of reconsideration. His notice '
wr 'f taken up yesterday and the vote !

ter went over to a future date and mean- j

D. B. FAKTOR SINGED.
The Well-Known Rifleman Severely
Burned by Gunpowder.
D. B. Faktor, the well-known rifleman.
met with an accident on Saturday that
will confine him to his house for several
days to come. He was the victim of an
explosion of gunpowder which came near
destroying his eyesight, besides burning
liis hands and face severely.
Mr. Faktor attended the public prize
rifle-shooting tournament of the S.
memo Helvetia Rifle Club, and carried a !
lot of powder in his satchel. On the wav
home some of the powder must
i.. en shaken out, for on Saturday he
found half a pound of the explosive
in the bottom. While preparlni
i.v at Shell Mound Park,
Faktor emptied the stuff into a p
which he ' arried to the edg^ of the side
walk on the corner of Stockton and
n'FarnMl streets. He poured the pO"Â»
into the gutter and the explosive must
have fallen upon the stump of a cigar
or cigarette, for there was .-i Hash and
the furl force of the flame struck Faktor
fairly in the faos, burning his hair, eye- .
brows and hands severely. For a time
thf physician feared for his eyesight, but
the danger point is now passed and tho
rifleman will be around in the course of
three or four days

h. . rs are regaled with real first-night per
formances, hence when such aai Important
does occur In the annals of local
theater history swelldom and clubdom
! turn out in full force and in full dress.
i for that matter, in order to lend luster
to the tout ensemble. Thus the Grand
Opera-house had all the appearance of a
gala night when H. J. Stewart's and Clay
ai. Greene's comic opera, "The Uonsplra
; tors," had its maiden production. There
; were curtain call 9 galore and encores In
plenty. The author was called before the
i curtain and a speech was insisted upon
which, as usual, contained a bunch of
thanks for everybody In general and the
piayers in particular.
Dr. Stewan struck a fortunate lead
when i;.- chose the light, merry vein of
composition. And, notwithstanding it i?
ear-tl(jkHng tendencies it is oÂ£ very good
iiuality. 'J ne orchestration is very artis
tically worked out and shows the ability
of tht- composer In the direction of har
! mony. Thi action 1 consider the
duct between Juanlto (.soprano) and i>on
Filipo (bass), Bupported, or, rather, aug
i men ted, by a very impressive chorus ef
iVct behind the scenes. Another pretty
selection is a madrigal quintet. Equally
worthy of praise 1b the finale of the first
act, consisting of a catchy waltz song.
whose opening strains resemble somewhat
Gounod's "bluing Song," but which
does not mar its beauty In the least.
In the second act it Ja a Spanish waltz
song and ballad for the tenor which re
i ceive the most applause. As far as the
plot is ooncerned the comedy is rather in
the ensemble than in the individual
work. Miss Bt-ssie Fairbairn as the Queen
| of Spain stems to be the comedian of tne
â  play and receives the most laughter. .Miss
i Edith Mason in the title role assisted
greatly In the success of the play. Sue
looked very handsome, as usual, Â».nd
i made quite a dashing Don Juanlto. She
sang with that care and clearness of voice
i which mark all her performances, 'x ne
i other players who created the first roles
were Arthur Wooley, Nace Bonneville,
Thomas H. Persse, William Woolf, in
fred Guff, Hattie Belle Ladd and Georgie
Cuoper.
The costumes were brilliant and the
scenery elegant. The mounting of the
piece was In all respects luxurious and
1 tasteful, which fact reilects creditably on
Charles H. Junes, who must have devoted
much time ai.J labor in the accomplish
ment of such magnificent scenic effects.
The ballets were very chic.

Columbia.
"The Milk White Flag" is not a young
farce. It comes to the Columbia well
along in middle years, and it has cast
aside Ihe wild hilarity of youth. It has
settled down Into comfortable, friendly
chuckles that are for the sake of avid
lang syne, but nobody .seems to like it
uny the less because it has ceased to sur
prise.
it seems to be the established precedent
of the New STork farce to bring along one
real rousing hit and depend tor the rest
upon mediocrity which apologises for it-
Self by being metropolitan. The hit last
week was .Bertie Fowler; now it is Littld
Chip.
He is a smack of humanity, with feet
that click and clatter like plantation
bones, and he la not entirely spoiled.
This is part of his secret. Moreover, the
audience does not see quite enough of
him, wherein still more of his secret lies.
.Beyond this, it isn't worth while to in
vestigate the reasons of his funniness.
He probably doesn't know them himself,
and if he aid there would be an end of
it.
The Roll Call of the Ransom Guards
bears few names that will bo recalled
when next they appear on a programme.
John Marble as the undertaker is worth
while, and Robert Germaine in Napoleonic
guise is good-looking enough to be for
given by Napoleon. The rest depend upon
the play to play itself, and the old "Milk
White Flag" rises to the emergency.
As for mo of the ladies of the com
pany â oh, well, charity is cheap enough
for any audience to afford. It is the most
economical virtue in the world, and it
would be a shame indeed if San Francisco
people could not Indulge. Besides, Cora
Morlan's dressmaker has done herself
proud, and Miss Morlan must be as good
to hang gowns upon as any patent model,
except she can't be telescoped.
Mabel Hit does not ask for charity.
Her turn takes care of itself, and the
Lawrence sisters are clever enough acro
bats to make up for being very tedious
singers. But the chorus does not look
well fed, and health has much to do
with beauty, you know.
The flag still flutters, but mildly.
SARAH COMSTOCK.
Tivoli.
"La Belle Helene," a comic opera In
which the characters and scenes, but not
the words, are taken from the mythology
of Homer, was put on at the Tivoli last
night and was quite enthusiastically re
ceived. The production is rather difficult
of analysis because there is really noth
ing that calls for such a delicate opera
tion. The whole scheme is a burlesque
based on the love story of Paris, ' the
handsome son of King Priam of Troy
and Helene, the beautiful wife of Mene
laus, King Of Sparta. The latter is pic
tured as a senile, decrepit monarch, while
Agamemnon, Achilles and the two
Ajaxes, those famous and dignified old
warrior kings, were made about as ridic
ulous as possible. The absurdity reaches
its height at the end of the second act,
when Paris, the handsome but effeminate
prince, drives the whole flock of mytho
logical heroes before him by jabbing at
them with a short Greek broadsword,
â which he wields as a modern duellist
would a rapier.
The humor is largely made up of local
gags, some of which are quite clever. Ada
Walker Palmer as Helens has a good
singing part and Is equal to all demands
made upon her. Julia Cotto as Orestes
has a solo, with which she scored a de
cided hit. Phil Branson as Menelaus di
vided honors with Alf C. Wheelan as
Calchas the Grand Augur, both comedy
parts. Tom Greene as Paris was well re
ceived, but he injured his reputation for
graceful deportment by walking on his
lady love's train in the middle of a very
strong love scene. The chorus is suscepti
ble of improvement.
California.
The musical farce-comedy, "A Breach
of Promise," attracted another large
audience to the California last night and
the laughter was incessant. Joseph Har
rington; Burt Haverly, Hurt Jordan Nel
lie Senneth, Rosa Crouch, Tony 'Pearl
and Memphis Kennedy In their specialties
are quite entertaining. Haverly's imita
tion of Sousa is the hit of the piece.
â  Otpheum.
There was not even standing room at
the Orpheum last night. The programme
warranted the house. It was brim full of
good turns, and every one of them re
ceived its full mead of praise. Wright
HuntinKton. in Brandon Hurst's comedy
"A Stolen Kiss," was particularly good'
The trick and musical canines and the
gymnast monkeys made everybody won
der how animal training could be brought
to such perfection. Bada won three re
calls for her performance on the violin
and the Florenz troupe of acrobats were
quite entertaining. Laura Burt was a
success as a monologue artist, but her
singing of old-fashioned love songs was
what caught the fancy of the house and
won her several recalls.

MISS HATTIE McLEOD
BURNED TO A CRISP
Horrible Death of a Prominent
Oakland Young Lady,
OAKLAND. Oct. 23.â Miss Hattle M^-
I.cod. aged 25 years, a daughter of
Daniel McLeod, the contractor and
builder, met a horrible death by fire
to-night at her parents' homo, 1024
Seventeenth street. Shortly after 0 o'clock
the young woman was seated at a small
table in her bedroom working on a
muffler. Suddenly she arose, and the
muffler becoming entangled with an ordi
rary glass hand-lamp, upset the latter,
which broke in pieces at her feet. Be
fore she could escape the burning oil had
Ignited her dress, a light wrapper, and
before aid could be summoned her body
was so horribly burned that she died of
her Injuries at 11:10. several hours later.
Her agonizing screams brought her
mother and a cousin to the scene almost
immediately. At the same time George
Muller. a member of Truck 3 of the Fire
Department, and who Is employed by the
Western Union Telegraph Company, was
passing by on his wheel. The flames in
Miss McLeod's bedroom, on the second
floor, attracted his attention, and he in
stantly rushed Into the house and to the
room. The sight he there witnessed was
most horrible to behold. Muller imme
diately grabbed Ihe clothing from the bed
and by rolling the young woman in its
folds Bmothered the flames.
Dr. F. Wilkes was promptly summoned,
NOW A JAILER
CLAIMS SARAH
BYROD'S ESTATE
Bitter Legal Battle in
Open Court.
Oakland Office SaJi Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, â¢_ ct. 23.
There were several Interesting urprises
sprung to-day In the multiplicity of con
tests over the $6000 estate of Sarah B.
Byrod, deceased, and several exciting
scenes were enacted before Superior Judge
Hall when the matter of the petitions ot 1
Darwin C. de Go lla and George \V. Kelley |
for a distribution of the estate came on
for hearing.
Mrs. Byrod was formerly an Oakland i
school teacher and when she died she left j
her estate to the Home of Truth and |
named Mrs. Mary Hawkins as executrix, i
For some reason under the law the home j
could not enjoy the bequest Mrs. Byrod j
had Ignored Frederick Wilson Byrod In j
her will and he claims to have been her
husband. He was in Jail at Sacramento j
for drunkenness and employed attorneys j
to recover the estate for himself, li ]
December, IS^S, he assigned his Interest j
in the estate to Attorney Darwin C. de j
Golla of this city, the agreement being ,
that the attorney is to retain one-half of
the amount recovered. |
In the meantime Byrod had employed j
Frank B. Ryan, a Sacramento attorney, (
to tight De Oolia afterward and one con- ;
test led to another. Finally George Kel
ley a Sacramento jailer, petitioned toat :
the' estate be distributed, and De Oolia..
on behalf of Byrod, tiled a similar peti
tion When the matter came up in court
to-day there was a considerable array of
legal' talent from the Capital City. At-;
orneys John C. March and W. W. Rhodes ;
wire on hand to protect the interests of
Kelley; Attorney Ryan had come down'
ostensibly to lepresent Byrod, but was
knocked out in the first round. Byrod
taking the stand and declaring Ryan was j
not his attorney; and Darwin C. de Goiia :
represented Byrod.
Suddenly at one stage of the proceed- j
inKS Attorneys Rhodes and March pro
duced an absolute assignment of all in- i
terest *n the estate from Byrod to Jailer |
Kelley dated June 24, 1899, and it now ap
pears as though, should De Goiia succeed
In hie petition for distribution, what is
left over nft^r his fees have been met i
may not go to Byrod, but to Jailer Kel- I
lev as per assignment, which was duly
acknowledged before Notary Grove JL. j
Johnson.
Because an agreement wherein Kelley i
had stipulated to care for Byrod dining
his remaining days had not been brought j
into court, but is concealed in Rhodes' |
safe, Judge Hall continued the matter j
until next Saturday.
At one stage Byrod on the witness stand !
declared that Attorney Rhodes had told |
him that "Ryan had been engaged in se.v- 1
era! shady transactions." To impeach
Byrod Rhodes insisted on being sworn
and testified that he cast no such asper- !
slon upon Ryan, whom he regarded as a
reputable attorney.
The bitterest of feeling and considerable
lack "f courtesy was shown between the
various attorneys and Judge Hall no'.ed
the ! ;i( 'k of confidence.
incidentally, to complicate matters ntlll
further, ExecutrtK Hawkins this after- j
noon also field a petition for diFtributlon.
DRIVER AND TEAM WERE
PLUNGED INTO THE BAY
BERKELEY. Oct. 25.-Through the OOl
lapM of a wharf at West B^keley this
morning a lumber vr&ffon <lriv?n by Jack
Mt-sin was thrown suddenly Into the bay.
The horses were pinned in by tne boards
and perished before help could arrive.
The driver by swimming was able to save
his life.
The accident occurred at 7:15 o'clock
this morning. Megin was driving off the
wharf with a load of damp lumber. When
about fifty feet from the end of the
stringers of the wharf it gave nay and
fully forty feet of the structure collapsed.
Driver, team and lumber were precipitat
ed into the water. It was with difficulty
hat the driver escaped with his life. The
horses could not be freed in time to save
themselves, as the timbers of t c wharf
held them down. The teum belonged to
Fountain Newell of West Berkeley and
was valued at $300.
The wharf Is owned by Samuel Hey
ward and was leased by him to the Tay
lor Lumber Company. No extra lumber
was stored upon the wharf at the time
and the accident Is attributed to the bad
state of repair in which the structure had
been kept.
TOUGH BURGLAR
AND A POOR JAIL
Q A\AKLAND, Oct. 23.â Gustave Seamans, a desperate burglar, who has
I Itwlce served short terms in the State prison, laughs at the bolts and bars Q
a V_/of the jail at Centervllle. About two months ago he escaped by cut- *
V ting his way out through the roof of the jail with a pocket-knife on the 7)
â¢fc night before his preliminary hearing. Last Friday Seamans was recaptured at [
A San Jose and Constable Vandervoort hastened to bring his prisoner to T
V Centerville's l.asttle. . Q
â¢Â¥â  When the Constable went to give the prisoner his breakfast this morning +
A Seamans had flown once again and the bright rays of the sun were streaming A
V down Into the dungeon through the same old hole in the roof, over which
some old boards had been nailed after the first Jail delivery. T
I and later Dr. Pratt was called, but both
â¢ physicians pronounced the case hopeless
: and that denth was Inevitable, notwith
! Ftandlnp the unfortunate victim remained
I conscious up to' within ;m hour of the
I end, und related to her grief-stricken par
ents how the accident occurred. She said
that she was working: on the muffler,
when she thought she heard her mother
call. "I Immediately got up to go down
! stairs to see what ma wanted of me," she
! whispered, "and the muffler caught on the
; lamp and threw it on the floor. It ex
ploded and the fire caught on my dress.
because I was trying to save the muffler.
jlt didn't belong to me." And then her
' strength would give out and she was cau
-1 tioned to compose herself as much as pos
sible.
There was hardly an inch of cuticle on
the unfortunate woman's body that was
not charred and her hands were burned to
a crisp. Her features were almost oblit
erated.
The dead young woman was a comely,
tall brunette, of the kindliest of disposi
tions and enjoyed a large circle of close
| friends. She was a member of the choir
of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, and
when she realized the end was near she
called for Rev. Dr. Huhne, formerly rec
: tor of the church, who promptly obeyed
j the summons and ministered what spirit-
I nal consolation lay in his power.
TOOK BACK HER
HUSBAND UNTIL
HE GAVE A DEED
Judge Greene Scores
Mrs. Cahill.
Oakland office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, October 23.
A mild sensation developed In the di
vorce suit of Christopher C. Cahlll against
Margaret P. Cahlll, brought on the
grounds of cruelty, which was up before
Judge Greene to-day on motion for coun- |
Bel fees, costs and alimony, and as a re- 1
suit of the discovery of a rase of re- ;
markable duplicity the wife was severely
scored by the court, she being openly
charged with perjuring herself.
The Cahllls, It appears, had about come ;
jto the conclusion to be reconciled, but
! hostilities broke out again yesterday.
' Matters have since become more compli
cated than ever and a warm time 1b an
ticipated.
The wife testified In court to-day that j
her husband had called on her lust Sat
urday, begging to be taken back and de- j
daring he could not stand the notoriety <>f
a divorce trial, so she Immediately con
sulted her attorneys, who drew up a
statement for her husband to sign, in
which all the scandalous remarks he bad
ever uttered against her in his complaint
were retracted. He hud also voluntarily
: deeded to her his interest in the home
stead. And now that hostilities had
broken out yesterday, she declared she
j was afraid of her life, and that the bus
! band had frequently warned her that
i their troubles would yet end in a tragedy. !
Cahill's testimony put a different aspect
ion the case, however. He admitted he
had signed a statement and the deed, but
said Mrs. Cahlll had also signed a state
' merit setting forth her promises, but that
this was In lead pencil, and so he had al
| lowed her to take It away to have the \
I same copied in ink. Afterward she nni
refused to make a new agreement, but
is t i 11 kept pussession of the other docu- :
ments. She had promptly placed the
deed on record.
"I never threatened to kill my wife.' 1
continued Caliill un the witness-stand,
"but she hns t^ice threatened to kill me,
by putting strychnine in my coffee. I was
' willing to go to almost any length to set
-1 tie our differences, but my home has been i
infested with men whom my wife has n
i vited to stop there, and I've been unable j
I to get rid of them. One of them, William
1 Sinkwitz, I had arrested recently for dis
turbing mv peace, but my wife ballad
i him out. T"hen 1 had him arrested a sec
i ond time and he ie now serving thirty
I days. I have always provided for my
i family, but I insist on being master of |
i my own house."
Judge Greene decided that he would not
rule on the motion for alimony until after
Mrs Cahlll has deeded back to her hus
band tl+ Interest in the homestead. "I
believe Cahill's statement." said the
< ourt "He tells a straight story, and
Mrs Cahlll had better deed back to him,
for I think It was got from him by a trick
lon her part. There is no doubt that
; he opened the way and she took advant
age of it. I don't believe Mrs. Cahill's
statement that she was not to abandon
I the divorce suit. Her conduct and her :
| own statement? show that she has not \
i been honest in the matter."
! Judge Greene accordingly continued tne ;
i case until to-morrow morning to allow ,
' : Mrs Cahill time in which to restore to
her husband his interest in the home near
Fruitvale. _

OUTWITTED A
CLEVER TRICK
OF THE RECTOR
Vestry Accepts Dr.
Law's Resignation.
Oakland Office San Frnnolpeo Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 23.
It Is as interesting as a game of bluff. '
the clever little game thai has been:
played between Rector Marshal] Law and
the vestry of the Church of the Advent, j
The vestry held a special meeting to
night to consider the rector's resignation.
The meeting was called by order of. C. B.
Foot, the junior warden, In the absence j
of J. J. Valentine, senior warden. Dr.
I.aw stated yesterday that he held the
fort, as a meeting of the vestry to accept
nl.s resignation could only be called by I
the junior and BenJor warden, and both |
are out of town. Now comes the little j
surprise to the rector. Unknown to him, j
before Vestryman Pope left Oakland he |
resigned as junior warden and Mr. Foot
was regularly elected to succeed him. This
throws down the latest move oJ the rec
tor.
Dr. Law has stated that there ia no
force to the agreement by which he prom
ised to resign this month if certain things
were carried out, and he has therefore
put io a resignation conditioned upon the
not granting to him of complete power in
the church and additional salary. This
was the resignation which the vestry de
cided to recognize.
The vestry decided to accept this resig
nation, because by so doing they will
score two points at once. They will get
rid of the rector, who is not congenial to !
i them ami they will save money, because
in the original agreement they undertook
to pay the expenses of Mrs. Law and
family East, whereas by the ordinary ac
ceptance of the rector's latest resignation
they are relieved from such responsibility.
The vestry is now composed of J. J.
Valentine, senior warden; C. B. Foot,
junior warden; Richard Burr, Dr. H. I.
Jones, J. Stalder and A. J. Reid. J. J.
Valentino, although he resigned some |
months atro, after a disagreement with the \
rector, is still senior warden, the records j
showing that his resignation was not ac
cepted but was returned to him with the i
request for a reconsideration. As he has j
not made a reo.ues.t that the resignation
be considered final. It Is assumed that he
is morally as well as officially in office.
The full extent of the opposition exist
ing to the rector may be gathered from
the act of the choir in refusing to sing
yesterday, as told in to-day's Pall. There
are about fifty members in the choir, all I
vested, and it was organized by Dr. Law !
and trained by his wife, who acted as nr
panlst and choirmaster. Yesterday all of
these singers were so averse to "singiner
while Dr. Law was present that they re- :
fused to occupy their seats In the chancel. 1
MAUTALEN DIVORCE
SUIT HAS BEEN FILED
OAKLAND, Oct. 23.â Charles Mautalen
has been sued for a divorce by Alice
Mautalen, the wife alleging that he haa
failed to provide for her for over a year.
Mrs. Mautalen is one of several pretty
Bisters who resided in San Francisco and
who have made much social history here
and In I>ondon during the past live years.
One of her sisters married somebody with
a title and another figured as a victim in
a diamond robbery.
Nearly three years ago the Mautalens
were married at Sacramento while he was
an attache of the Legislature. At that
time Mautalen, who had been chairman
of the County Central Republican Com
mittee, was on the crest of his political
power, nnd the wedding was quite an
event, Nearly a year ago the couple sep
arated and the suit fllea to-day was no<
a surprise. The romantic careers of the
Newland Bisters, of whom Mrs. Mautalen
is one. have been very freely exploited in
the newspapers.

A MODEL STORE BUILDING.
Goldberg. Bowen & Co. Have Taken
Possession of Their New
Quarters.
The site of the old Vniing Men's Christ
ian Association building has bei a taken
possession of by Goldberg, Bowen & Co.,
which lias moved from Its former loca
tion across Slitter street to the building
the company fitted up for itself on the
old association property at 230 and .'34 Sut
ter street, which it recently purchased.
The building h:\s been fitted up with a
view to the special needs of the com
pany's business, and nothing has !>â¢ en
omitted that would add to its conveni
ent. The first floor is done in maple.
With plate glass counter tops and lighted
by large plate glass windows that take
ill' nearly the entire front of the store.
California marble i? extensively used In
the Interior linings and the fixtures are
all done in artistic iron work. Just in
side the main doorway is the seal of the
house beautifully inlaid in the stone floor.
The stock has been arranged in depart
ments, and the coarser goods have been
relegated to. the basement. Bach depart
ment has its own distinctive decoration,
iind the arrangement is such that the
greatest amount of the stock can be put
on exhibition without encroaching on the
aiÃli space and crowding the patrons.
The building runs back to Berry street,
where the receiving and delivery wagons
take or leave their loads, leaving the
front of the Store unobstructed by freight
or wagons along the sidewalk.
The basement has been fitted up in the
most convenient manner possible: it is
large and airy and well lighted, and capa
ble of housing an immense stock.
Altogether the store is in every way
one of the most modern and best ap
pointed store buildings In the city. The
decorations throughout are most artistic,
and the effect Âf the care with which the
general plan of decoration has I n car
ried out Is evident. So far as an example
of the conveniences possible in a modern
store is concerned, the new building is
in every way a model.
LIKE SHYLOCK OF OLD.
Mrs. Mary Leishman Refused to De-
liver a Dead Woman's Clothes
Unless Paid Her Bill.
E. W. Dutcher. who Is employed at the
Tesla coal mines, called at police head
quarters yesterday and informed" Sergeant
Mofntt that his wife had died Saturday in
the house of Mrs. Mary Irishman, a pro
fessional nurse, Burline street, San Bruno
road. The funeral was to take place this
morning, but Mrs. Leishman had refused
to deliver his wife's clothes to be used In
dressing the body for interment, because
he was unable to pay her a board Lull
of $15.
The Sergeant took Dutcher to Judge
Mogan. who iFsuÂ«-d a search warrant for
the recovery of the clothes, and willingly
consented to hold court in the afternoon
in view of the urgency of the case. The
search warrant was given to Detective
R. F. Graham, who took the clothes to
the courtroom.
Dutcher admitted his liability, hut said
he was unable to pay the $15 board bill
Just at present. He agreed to do so as
soon as possible. Mrs. Leishman took the
stand and refused point blank to deliver
the clothes unless she got her money and
also $13 for doctor's fees, for which she
was responsible.
The, Judge told her she was a heartless
woman and had no legal right to hold the
colthes, her proper course being to sue
Dutcher in the Justices' Court, and he
awarded the clothes to the husband. Mrs.
Leishman, who proved to be a voluble <
witness, persisted in talking, and after !
the Judge had several times warned her
to keep quiet, he ordered her into custody ;
for contempt of court, but soon afterward :
released her on her own recognizance.

ADMIRAL WATSON'S
ACTION IS APROVED
Navy Department Issues an Order
Confirming the Removal of
Commander Taussig.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.â The incident
that occurred In the Philippines between
Rear Admiral John C. Watson, comman
der In chief of the Asiatic etation, and
Commander F. D. Taussig. in command
of the Bennington, owing to a misunder
standing as to the way In which certain
orders of the admiral "were to be carried
out, as a result of which Commander
Taussig was relieved of his command and
ordered to return to the United States,
has befii closed by the Issuance by the
Navy Department of the following order:
"Admiral Watson's order is held to be
within the discretionary authority vested
In him by article 304. paragraph 3, of the
Navy Reg-ulations. it being Impracticable
to have a court of inquiry, and, owing to
the present importance of the Asiatic sta
tion, indispensable that harmony should
be maintained in his command.
"Commander Taussig is regarded, from
the time of his arrival in the United
States, as having been detached from
duty on a foreign station. He was or
dered home and placed on waiting orders
as in ordinary oases. He has now been
given appropriate shore duty in connec
tion with the Ijighthouse Bureau and,
when practicable, will have command of
another vessel, commensurate with his
rank, to serve elsewhere than on the As
iatic station."
TEMPERANCE WORKERS.
Little Accomplished at Yesterday's
Session of the Convention.
SEATTLE, Oct. 23.â Owing to the fact
that the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union abandoned the morning session to
day, the convention is somewhat delayed
in Its work. The committee on resolu
tions, for whoso report the convention is
anxiously waiting, went over until to
morrow. The committee briefly outlined
the resolutions favoring a flag law, anti
divorce, against seating Congressman
| Roberts of Utah, anti-canteen and hinted
I at several other special resolutions.
The anti-narcotio branch of the union
! addressed the public school pupils,
twenty-two of the schools of the city be
ing visited. Some ten memorial life mem
berships were taken out.
The resolution offered by the National
Fuffrage Association through Mrs. Carrie
Chapman Catt of New York, who is hero,
were voted down upon recommendation of
the executive committee of the Woman's
I Christian Temperance Union, declaring
I that they preferred to handle the woman's
I suffrage question up< n the lines already
j laid down by them.
Telegrams from the Mothers' Assembly
I of New York and various other Eastern
I organizations were received, congratulat
j ing the convention upon the unexpectedly
I large attendance of delegates and the
'â  work done.
In the Sunday-school branch contest,
i Ohio took the first prize banner. Northern
: California second, New Jersey third and
i Illinois fourth, each State, however, be
ing first in the special class of work for
which the banners were offered.

kind of man, who, when a cough attacks
him, goes galloping down the road
toward consumption. Many such a man
has found strength and healing for weak
lungs and tissues lacerated by coughing
and drained by hemorrhages, in the use
of Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discov-

cine in pulmonary diseases seems little
short of marvelous at times, so extreme
are the conditions which it cures. The
"Discovery" contains no alcohol, and
no narcotics.
"When I started to take your 'Golden Med-

ment, not only to this State but to the
entire West, will come up for considera
tion. The decisions that will be reached
will have an Important bearing on the
future of tho mining Industries of the
gold-producing section of the nation.
Questions will be considered which will
in a measure determine whether the men
who delve Into the bowels of the earth
for the treasure which has made the
Golden West world-famous shall continue
in their march toward the pinnacle of
success or shall stop and retrace their
Bteps.
The assemblage recalls a great deal
that is of interest to this State. Among
the legates are men who have made
much of California's history. There are
some who with pick and shovel and pan
revealed the possibilities of the State's
importance as the greatest gold-produc
ing territory of the world as far back as
the "days of "49." The delegates who rep
resent the younger generation of miners
are those who followed the pioneers and
assisted in developing the great golden
resources of California and bringing ltd
wealth to the attention of nations.
No previous convention of miners of
California has been called upon to decide
and take action upon as many important
matters as will come before the present
session of the California Miners' Associa
tion. The trend of the discussion of yes
terday makes it plain that the miners of
the West will â  make a unanimous de
mand upon Congress for the creation of a
Secretary of Mines and Mining. This is
one of the paramount objects for which
the association will contend. A light for
the- Caminetti act will also be inaugur
ated and many other matters for the
protection and advancement of tue min
ing industry will be undertaken. Tho
delegates have determined that these
questions must not be lightly passed over
by the adoption of resolutions. The work
is to be undertaken and the workers are
to be given the support of the associa
tion and the necessary financial backing
to successfully pursue their fight.
Yesterday's proceedings were not in
tended to go much beyond the organiza
tion of the convention, but matters were
so ably handled that â  the preliminaries
consumed but little time, and an oppor
tunity was given for the president's an
nual report and the statements from some
of the important permanent committees.
President >.'â¢.â¢ It's address teemed with mat
ters of moment to the miners. There was
not a passage in it that did not have an
Important bearing on the industry or did
not offer some timely suggestion for its
advancement and benefit. The real work
of the session will commence to-day with
the election of a new board of officers,
upon whom will devolve the duty of carry
ing out the plans adopted by the conven
tion.
Golden Gate Hall was 'gay with bunting
and banners when President Neff called the
Miners Association to order yesterday
morning. Without any preliminaries lie
introduced Mayor Phelan who, on behalf
of the city, extended a welcome to the
delegates, He stated that the duty was
a pleasant one and thanked the miners
for all that. they had done for the city
and all that they would do In the future

statement that the fight for the hydraulic
miners should hr renewed struck a key
note among the delegates. President Neff
s;ii(l In pan :
When, In November, 1831, a few pretty well
' discouraged ex-hydraulic miners met at Au
; hum. Placer County, to â â â >nÂ«ir!'>r som* plan '
by which to call the attention of the
illfornia to the condition of their in
dustry a.nd appeal to thtm for assistance In its
: rehabilitation it was with a sort of "last hope 1 'â 
; Fpirlt. They had been, so to speak, the "under j
- Jng" for years. The Government, the State. I
tho counties, "the courts, the people and the |
prt-ss had been against them and the furthpr
prosecution of their work. Millions of dollars
wore tied up Jn the Investments and hundreds ,
' of millions locked up In the untouched <!â¢â â â¢:â 
rraveis throughout the hydraulic mining coun
! ties.
They had enemies even among themselvesâ
jmm who were surreptitiously conducting
operations which were under the ban of the
law, and thus Ftlll further aggravating to re
newed opposition theme who felt that their
rights were being Infringed.
ThoÃo miners at Auburn were only a few of
I that numerous Viand who had been flchtlng
! their cause for years, with antagonism on nil ,
I Bides, finally to meet disaster and apparently '
Permanent defeat In the courts. Even the sug
gestion of an attempt at renewal of operations ,
was met with a howl of opposition.
But these, miners of Auburn bullded better
; than they knew. They were destined to set I
i the corner-stone and to lay the foundation of '
! an Institution which not only threw its pro
i tectlng aegis over them, but over those on
-1 gaged In all branches of the mining Industry, j
Among Its other work this association has se- !
i cured appropriations from State and Federal i
governments In aid of the mining industry; has
secured the passage of several favorable acts
by the State Legislature; has assisted ma- !
I terlally In several mining exhibitions; worked i
with the Trans-Mlssisslppl and Mining con- j
presses: caused the Lend Department of tho
Government to act more favorably toward the
mining Interests; brought forcibly to the at- i
tentlon of Congress the encroachments of our- j
I pnnuions on the public mineral domain, so
| that this will shortly be stopped; Inaugurated
1 the movement for the conservation of water
I In California, and that looking toward tho
appointment of a Cabinet officer with a Dp- !
partment of Mines and Mining; helped revis*
certain State laws, and, perhaps more than all. '
has created and fostered a public sentiment !
favorable to the mining Industry of California I
and to the miners themselves.
To the press of this city and of the entire
State we are Indebted for many favors. It has
very fairly reported our proceedings at all
times, and has promptly called attention to any !
of our measures before the Legislature and
Congress, generally approving and urging th<Â»lr
adoption. In fact, ever since the organization
j of this association the press of California has
! taken a lively Interest in the miners' move
j ment, and has done everything it oould to en-
I hnnce and benefit the mining Industry.
ThÂ»re are several matters which tlie members
of this convention must earnestly consider and
by their resolutions. Indicate the course the
miners of the State should pursue. In the first '
place, we should continue to urge before Con
gress the so-called mineral lands bill, upon
, which we have already expended bo much la
bor. It was with difficulty we could at first
obtain even a hearing in Congress on this sub
ject, but finally only a technical point prevented
the passage of the bill. It is highly probable
that this pending measure will pass the next
time it is considered by Congress, but we must
spare no efforts to see that it does. Week by
week, month by month, year by year, sees the
domain of the prospector narrowed, contracted
and lessened in space, throughout the mining
States by the present policy or the great corpo
rations who are claiming and taking what the
law never gave them and never intended to
give.
Kven while the question is pending, thousands
and thousands of acres of mineral lands are
passing by railroad title into hands which com
pel the miner to pay for what the Government
expressly saved tor him to open and develop
without cost.
Then we want that Department of Mines and
Mining and that Secretary of Mines In the Cab
inet ot the nation. Why, last rear the miners
of this country dug out of the ground mineral
products of the value of over seven hundred
millions of dollars and that was over sixty mil
lions more than In the previous year. Why
should not Â«n Industry with such a growing,
substantial record have some representative in
the councils of the nation? Talk about the
need of protecting our industries'. Here is one
Of great magnitude absolutely unprotected. It
is unprotected, I Bay, from the assaults or' the
great railroad corporations; from the sinister
attacks of officials In the departments, from
the very Ignorance of Congress Itself. What
ever attack may be made .upon It in the shape
of unwise laws and adverse legislation, there
is now no man to say nay. There is no one to
advise the President on the subject and it Is an
Industry which Is scarcely recognized In Gov
ernment councils.
Why should we not have a Secretary of Mines
and Mining to pass upon and adjudicate mat
ters relating to mineral lands. Instead of a
Land Commissioner and Secretary of the In
terior with so much on their hands that, they
scarcely have time to find rut what a mine Is, much
less what the miners need? Why should some
man who Is from an agricultural community,
with his sympathies and experiences all in that
direction. Bit in judgment on the property in
terests of the vast number of hardy men who
are digging their living from the rugged moun
tains of the western side of this continent
We want relief from the present burdensome
system, and we want it badly and quickly. We
must keep constantly agitating this subject,
and our brother miners in all the other States
will back ue ur>.
These are national matters on which I have
thus far spoken. Hut here at home. In our
own fair State, where most of our work lies,
we have important problems to help solve It
was this association which flret suggested that
some genera] plan be urged for the conservation
of water, aside from that in vogue among the
private mining and ditch companies. Their ex
perience baa shown what can be done by Indi
viduals but vastly more can be accomplished
by public assistance and the adoption of a gen
eral system. The experience of the past two
years has shown what a vital necessity this
is for the general welfare of the producing
classes-the miner, farmer and manufacturer
Even In the "dry" years there is plenty of
water In the high mountain regions, could It but
be conserved for use during , the rainless
months. The climatic features peculiar to this
State require that the people unite in carrying
out some thorough system which will enable us
to control the flood waters and not allow them
to pass off as useless when we so badly need
them later on. '
During the past summer and the previous
one. mines and mills have suffered an en
forced Idleness, and hundred? of miners have
been thrown out of work simply because scant
provision had been made to hold back the
waters from the melting snows. And this con
dition of affairs must be frequently repeated
until a remedy Is applied. Â»-#â¢Â«â¢Â» Â»â¢â Â«>"
Resolutions will not build dams, but work
and money will. This Is the most Important
problem the miners or this State have yet to
! solve. It Is true some of our mining and ditch
' ''"it panlea have built some of the largest ditch
I find reservoir systems In the world, hut this
work has only commenced, as compared with
what has yet to be done.
And now another tiling, and one of no small
i importance, either. It Is evident that this as
; sociation has got to go back to first principles
i and take up the fight of the hydraulic miners
again. And we have got to take it up vigor
ously, too. The Caminetti law, for which we
: all fought so hard and which has accomplished
much, is In danger, and with it the whole hy
draulic mining industry of California once
more. Our old opponents, who were never
very well satisfied with the debris question be
ing taken out of local hands and placed In
those of the Government, want again to be In
â i position to have something to say in this
i matter. Their old weapon, the Injunction, has
been brought out and put into the hands of
' the men who formerly wielded it bo disas
â  trously and with such. dire effect.
This is the last convention in which I shall
occupy the chair, which I have filled, through
your courtesy, ever since the organization of
the California Miners' Association. Nominally
i I have had the direction of the affairs of the
I association for some years past, but. while I
j have had many excellent advisers, this Is really
1 the first time I have ever been allowed to have
1 my own way. I mean when I am at last per
mitted to retire to the ranks, so that some
i younger and more active man may preside over
. your deliberations.' I am afraid it, would take
' too many words to adequately express to you
i all the kindly sentiments I feel toward you
â  or the thanks I have deep In my heart for the
I consideration and help you . have given me
! during my terms of office. Like most of the
I rest of the members of this association I have
! been connected with the mining Industry for a
; great many years. My feelings and sympathies
i are all for the miners and their work, for I
1 am one of them myself, though my actual work
with the pick and shovel is done.
; The future of this organization is one of hope
. and of usefulness. There is much for us all
1 to do and more will come before us. As far
j as my experience has shown I feel certain that
! the right man will come to the front when we
i need special services. There are plenty of able
i men among our members and they all cheer
fully "stand In" with whatever work is to
j be done.
It but remains for me to again thank you
for all your courtesies to me.
At the conclusion of the president's ad
i dress there was a cry for "three cheers

given with a will that loft no doubt of
j their sincerity. Coming as they did from
1 the men who had worked with him when
I he tolled with the pick and shovel and

i expression of friendship.
A motion , was made and carried to ap

expressing the thanks of the association

B. N. Shoecraft, chairman of the com
â¢ mittee on the mineral exhibit at the Paris
Exposition, presented a report that was
1 in a measure discouraging. The commit

'. that would have been a credit to the
j State, but a lack of co-operation on the
part of the Legislature forced them to
! abandon the project. The exhibit as in-
I tended by the committee would have been
complete in every detail, giving an ade
quate representation of all the minerals
found in the State, the various forma

mines, models of mills and exhibit* of

Hon. Tirej L. Ford, the m..vii,i,- spirit
of the committee in whose hands had
been placed the matter of promoting the
creation of a Cabinet officer to be desig
nated Secretary of Mines and Mining
prefaced his report by a telling speech on
the importance and absolute necessity of
continuing the work until the object "was
accomplished. He indorsed the sfatMm.-nt
of President Neff that resolutions in
themselves accomplished nothing, and
urged that work be done. He said:
West of the Mississippi River the sentiment
s practically unanimous in favor of the estab
lishment of the desired Executive Depart
ment, and tlm Congressional delegation fmm
that portion of the country, h tie and
House are favorably disposed toward the
needed leglsl.-uion to establish such depart
ment. Kast of thÂ» Mississippi River, however
while there exists no well-defined opposition
there is a prevailing apathy that can only be
removed by active and intelligently directed
missionary work amonp those interested In the
various branches of the mining industry.
Your committee Is of the opinion that, with
proper and united effort ujmn the part of the
fri'-ii'ls of the mining Industry, a Departnu
Mines anil Mining can be established, w\
executive secretary at its head who shall be a
member of the Presidents Cabinet.
F. Chappellet introduced a resolution
that a committee be appointed to pelert
a list of officers to he voted upon to-day,
but the convention would not at;ree. Sec
retary Benjamin read the following tele
gram of greeting:

Oolden State tho members of the Anierii-an In
stitute of Mining Kiit'tneers. returning from
their memorable transrontiTiental trip. Fend
greeting to the California Miners' Association,
from which wÂ»- have received such magi I
hospitality. k. W. RAMON D, Secretary.
Congressman J. C. Needham also ad
dressed a communication t<> the associa
tion, assuring the delegates of his hearty
sympathy anil Kiiarunteeing his co-opera
tlon in their wnrk.
Julian Sonntag stated that it had been
brought to his attention that the Gov
ernor of Colorado was being urged to
call a convention of Western miners to
convene at Denver to impress upon Con
gress the necessity of creating the Secre
taryship Hi' Mines and .Mining. Mr. Sonn
tag suggested that the California Miners'
Association co-operate in the movement
and take the matter up during the pres
ent session. This reminded Judge Searls
of something that had evidently been
overlooked. He said thai some y.-ars ago
ho had been a delegate to a miners' con
vention at Denver and that as soon as he
arrived in that city the reception com
mittee pounced upon him and that in less
time than it took him to tell it he was
made acquainted with nearly every one in
the town.
"Here we have delegates from nearly all
of the Western States," said the Judge,
"and none of us has become acquainted
with them. Now, I want t<> know why in
thunder we haven't. Is this the sort of
reception old California gives? Is this
the way the old miners of forty-nine ex
tÂ»-ixl the glad hand? I favor taking a
recess and rushing at them and giving
them a taste of California's boasted hos
pitality."
After the appointment of the following
committee on resolutions the convention
adjourned until this morning:

and the election of officers. Among those
who aspire to succeed Mr. Neff as presi
dent are W. C. "Kalston. Julius Sonntag
and A. Caminettl. In the evening there
will be an illustrated lecture by Marsden
Manson on the subject of the "Distribu
tion and Variation of the Rainfall in Cali

The committee on resolutions met last
evening at the Palace Hotel and decided
to recommend the adoption of resolutions
suggested in the president's report and
one to determine the standing of dele

LINCOLN MONUMENT.
Bepresentative Committees Appointed
for Each County.
A meeting of the Lincoln Monument
League was hold last night at the offices
of Judge M. Cooney, Phelan building, and
the final preparatory steps were com
pleted.
A circular has been prepared and print
ed which calls the attentton of the public
to the purposes of the organization of the
league. The proposed monument will cost
$150,000, and according to the plans adopt
ed will be subscribed for by the people
of the entire State. Three representative
men from each county were appointed as
working committees, and they in turn
will select six others.
These nine men from each county will
make up the delegates to the conven
tion in this city to be held some time next
month. Much enthusiasm was mani
fested at the meeting last night and the
wnrk will soon be advanced toward a
consummation of the plans and inten
tions of the league.
NO OBJECTION TO
FAIR COMPETITION
But Imitation Is Flattery's Most
Odious Form.
If a person has to descend to the arts
of imitating a successful business man.
It is manifest that the imitator can he-pa
for nothing on his own merits. Chanr-s
Lyons has been before the public in this
city for twenty years, and his methods
of doing business have proved successful
from the start.
He gives the fullest value for the
money. He has all his cloths specially
manufactured for him, and has his own
exclusive patterns. He does an immense
business and carries ns large a stock as
any wholesale clothhouse.
Gentlemen who desire to do business
with Lyons will naturally feel aggriev*!
if they are entrapped by outward ap
pearances into trading with persons th^y
may wish to avoid, and with this end in
view Charles Lyons feels it necessary to
state that he has only one store on
Market street. No. 721. in the Histo-y
Building, carried on under the name and

He has nothing whatever to do with any

Lessees Pay for Fire Escapes,
A communication was sent to the Board
of Education yesterday by City Attorney
Franklin K. Lane regarding the placing
of fire escapes on the Lincoln School prop
erty, at Fifth and Market streets, m
which he holds that the board is not re
sponsible for the expense of erecting the
escapes and that by the terms of its lease
the improvement must be made by tne
corporation which has leased the prop
erty, namely the "Real Estate and Im
provement Company."
