was decked brilliantly to-day In
honor of the gallant sailor who
is waiting at her gate. Had an
ocean of color swept through the
â¢city. its ebbing tide could not have
Ftained the streets more brilliantly.
Hundreds of miles of red, white and
Tiluo bunting cover the noble facades of
Broadway and Fifth avenue, and a mil
lion flags flutter over the town. Not
â¢oven the churches have escaped the
"\miversal decorations. The doors and
. Gothic windows of old Trinity, on
lower Broad'-vay, are gracefully draped
â with the national colors, and in ancient
: 'Trinity graveyard the tomb of that gal
lant sailor who. dying, issued the com
mand not to give up the ship, lies
shrouded In the silken folds of the flag
for which he died.
A million visitors are here to partici
pate in the glorious celebration. Every
â road is pouring in a steady stream un
til the streets are crowded morning and
right, the surface and elevated cars are
filled to overflowing and the hotel corri
dors are jammed with viators. The
gayly appareled soldiers of many
States, who are to take part in the land
. Tirade on Saturday, began trooping in
to-day, and there was no hour when
uniformed men were not moving in
some quarter of the city to the sound
of fife and drum and horns.
Sailors and marines ashore from the
-Mg tlfibttng- machines helped to swell
the- crowd trooping In all directions.
Uniformed members of the staff of ar
riving Governors were everywhere.
The arrangements for the two days' cele
bration are completed. The great arch
nt Madison square, modeled after the
triumphal arch of Titus and upon which
the most famous sculptors of America
have lavished their genius, is practi
cally finished and stands a suberp trib
ute to the nation's hero. It is more
beautiful than the arch in Rome.

Concord. When they got aboard Ad
miral Dewey took them over the ship
and the sight of the fighting captains
set the tars mad with delight. Nothing
could restrain their enthusiasm and
round after round of cheers greeted the
appearance of these officers. Governor
Roosevelt was Assistant Secretary of
the Navy when Dewey was sent to the
command of the Asiatic squadron and
General Greene, who served in the
Philippines, is a personal friend of the
admiral of many yrars' standing. The
sight of the captains who were with
him during th.- stress "f that hot day
in Manila was good for th.' admiral's
eyes, so that altogether Dewey seemed
to enjoy this om<ial visit more than
any he has received. The local munici
pal authorities are somewhai piqued
because Governor Roosevelt extended
thr< formal welcome of the Siate to the
admiral before the Mayor had an op
portunity to offer his official greeting
on behalf of the city. This ceremony
will occur to-morrow.
While much powder was flung into
smoke down the bay to-day much more
will be burned to-morrow during the
groat naval pageant up the Hudson
River. The marine parade, unless it is
marred by bad w^ath^r. which thÂ« lo
cal forecaster unfortunately predicts!
is expected to eclipse all previous water
pageants on this Hide of the world. Th.
parade will move at 1 o'clock in four
divisions. First will come th" warships,
headed by the Olympia and Hanked on
either side by the torpedo-boats. They
will be followed by a fleet of white rev
enue cutters. Following them will be
the steam yachts in double column, led
by the Corsair, the flagship of the New-
York Yacht *'lub. To Sir Thomas Lip
ton's Kir in has been accorded the honor
of heading the starboard column of this
division. There will be 187 yachts in
line. The third division will consist of
the merchant marine steamers and an
Indiscriminate fleet of tugs, barges and
unattached vessels will bring up the
rear. It is expected that the line will
be nine miles long and that half a mil
lion people will be afloat. The parade
with the Olympia in the van will move
up the North River to the stakeboat St.
Marys, an old practice ship of the navy,
which Is moored opposite the Grant
mausoleum in Riverside Park. After
rounding the stakeboat the Olympia
will come to anchor below two beauti
ful floats representing "Peace" and
"Victory," and *Â»ach warship In its turn
will drop in below the flagship. The
national salute of twenty-one guns will

line of warships under the bluff, and
between these two lines the civic part
of the parade will pass in review.
Rear Admiral Howison gracefully

To-morrow night the grandest illu

history of the city will occur. To-night
there was a preliminary illumination
of rare beauty. All the buildings on
tho water front were lighted up. On
the Brooklyn bridge in letters of living

"Welcome Dewey," while simultaneous

rivers, Staten and Governors islands
red fire glowed and sputtered, sending
up fantastic smoke, turning the color of

SECRETARY LONG DETERMINED
UPON DEWEY'S ASSIGNMENT
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Sept. 28.â "1 do not recall a case &
whore it was a more simple act of the department and without the exercise of Influence on the part of any- tt
body outside, and I am happy to say that nothing has occurred to show that the department did not select the &
right man." . . <L
Thin waa the reply made by Secretary Long this afternoon to my question as to the official really responsi- gg
ble for Admiral Dewey's selection to command the Asiatic station. There have been various reports in clrcu- Q
latlon, all erroneous, according to officials interviewed, one of which is to the effect that the President selected j5
Dewey and another that Governor Roosevelt suggested the selection. Undoubtedly Secretary' Long did con- g
suit Mr. Roosevelt regarding the admiral, but he also talked with Admiral Crowninshleld and others whom w
he thought might have knowledge of the then commodore. It has been stated that the President took a hand in â¢*
the selection of Commodore Dewey for the Asiatic station. This is untrue. The selection was made by Secre- js
tary Long without any intimation from that official but solely upon his own motion and after he had made the $
Inquiries stated. After the Secretary had determined upon Dewey's assignment he Informed the President of g
his decision, and that was the first time it had been mentioned between them. g;

presented each of th.' visitors to Cap
tain Lamberton and then all went tc
the admiral's cabin, where the comniit
!'â â¢ completed the programme of the
Washington committee and he express
ed his entire satisfaction with the cele
bration. Secretary Pruden presented
an invitation to a dinner with the Presi
dent, and the admiral accepted it.
Admiral George W. Baird, who sailed
with Farragut and Dewey in the Gulf
squadron in 1861, unrolled a package
which he had carefully guarded all the
way to the Olympia, and, displaying a
faded blue admiral's ensign, upon which
were attached four white stars, he said
to Admiral Dewey:
"Admiral, I wish to present to you the
first admiral's flag ever 'broken out' in
the navy of this country. The admiral
whose name and memory we all so re
vere first hoisted this ensign upon the
good ship Hartford before New Orleans
and afterward upi.-n the Franklin, and
since it came down from that masthead
It has never been whipped by the wind
or worn by the elements. You, the wor
thy successor of that great admiral,
whose tactics you so successfully fol
lowed a short while ago, I deem the
proper person for Farragut's mantle to
fall upon."
This flag was mad.' by Quartermaster
Knowles out of a blue "number" flag
when Farragut was tirst made a rear
admiral. Two white stars were sewed
on it. When Farragut was made an ad
miral two more white stars were sewed
on it. Farragut flew this flag on the
Hartford at New Orleans and afterward
in the Mediterranean.
The admiral was deeply affected, and
tears were in his eyes as he gazed at the
souvenir. It was several moments be
f..;-.. he recovered his voice. Finally he
B ald:
"I'll fly it. I'll fly it at tho masthead.
I'll fly it in the parade. I'll fly it always
âandâ and â when I strike my admiral's
flag this shall be the flag I shall strike."
This was tho most impressive scene
that has occurred on the Olympia since
her arrival in port, and for some time
no one spoke.
TEDDY WELCOMED
BUT ' VERMONTERS
ARE CUT SHORT
NEW YORK. Sept. 28.â During Gov
ernor Roosevelt's visit Admiral Dewey
took occasion to let the world know
his estimate of the character of the
man he -was entertaining and to whom
he believed he owed much of his pres
ent fame. The admiral said: "Gov
ernor, I want the men to see you. I
want you to see the men."
Turning to Brumby he said: "Brum
by, you get the men up. I want to
have them see the Governor."
After the men had seen and been
seen and listened to a little compli
mentary speech by "Teddy," the ad
miral took the Governor and his old
friends below to his room and calling
the steward said: "Here, boy, get us
some of that contraband o' war â cham
pagne." and bottles were brought out.
"The last time we all met," said the
admiral, speaking to the captains,
"was on the 30th of April, ISPS, the
night before the scrimmage, wasn't it.
And now I want to propose the health
of the man who had more to do toward
making me an admiral than any other
man in the United States â Governor
ftoosevelt."
Captain Lamberton broke in here
with: "Governor, he has told me that a
thousand times." The toast was drunk
by Dowry and the captains, while
"Teddy" stood blushing and speechless,
embarrassed as a school girl, with a
glass of champagne untouched in his
hand. He caught sight at the moment
Of a bevy of girls looking on the scene
through the skylight and passed the
glass to the nearest, who took a sip
and passed it on till the fifth emptied
it and declared she would keep the
glass as a souvenir. Thus Roosevelt
was relieved of the necessity of making
any reply.
When the Governor and his party left
the ship he was given a salute of sev
enteen guns, as many as an admiral is
entitled to. Governor Roosevelt had
been gone about half an hour and the
admiral still had a lot of friends with
him, when along came the Lieutenant
Governor of Vermont and the Govern
or's staff and two members of the re
ception committee that is waiting to
tackle the admiral when New York and
Washington get through with him. The
admiral had a warm and hearty recep
tion in waiting for the Vermonters.
They had gold lace to burn and swords,
too, and dignity thick as plaster. Lieu
tenant Governor Bath came first and
gravely saluted the admiral. The mem
bers of the staff came next and gravely
saluted the admiral and lined up.
swords clanking, all glum and decorum
and mum as oysters. It wasn't the sort
of reception the admiral had been used
to. The smile on his face seemed to dim
a bit as the Lieutenant Governor
stepped forward and said:
"In behalf of the people of Vermont I
want to welcome you to your native
land and tell you how proud of you the
people of your native State are; and
when you get there â "
At this point the admiral exclaimed:
"Yes, yes, I'm coming; I'm going there;
I'm going to Vermont. I'm glad to see
you, boys; I'm going there."
And then he turned to a gentleman
who approached him with two little
boys and a little girl, leaving the gold

COGHLAN IS
WARMLY GREETED
BY THE ADMIRAL
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â One of the
personal friendships that Admiral Dew
ey renewed aboard the Olympia this
afternoon was that with Captain
Joseph B. Coghlan, who commanded
the Raleigh at Manila and is now com
mandant of the Port Orchard (Wash.)
naval station. Captain Coghlan was
one of Governor Roosevelt's guests and
when he climbed to the head of tha
gangway the admiral rushed over to
him and grasping him by the hand he
exclaimed: "Why, Joe, how well you
are looking." And then he went on
with twinkling eyes: "What's this I
have heard about your learning to
sing?"
Then seizing the captain's shoulders
he shook him as if chiding him and
both laughed heartily at the admiral's
reference to Coghlan's "Hoch der
Kaiser" song.
VAST THRONGS
AND DAZZLING
DECORATIONS
NEW YORK. Sept. 28.â Jammed and
packed were the sidewalks to-day and
the throng walked in the streets along
the curbs. Broadway and Fifth ave
nue resembled streams in the lumber
regions, when the spring freshet has
started. Hundreds of thousands of vis
itors filled the city, captured hotels and
quartered themselves in private houses.
They stowed away their valises and
handbags and then went out to see the
sights and decorations. They had an
upward tilt of countenance, for their
eyes were fastened on flags high aloft
and upon columns and wings of dazzling
white. It was a throng representing
every State, for the preparations for
the reception of the hero of Manila Bay
stirred many from remote parts ,>f the
country to hasten to the metropolis in
the hope of seeing the admiral before
their neighbors couid get a chance.
Here was a loyal enthusiastic crowd,
proud to cheer at the mention of
Dewey's name. A decoration more spir
ited than ordinary, a chance word in
the stieet, the raising of a tablet in
scribed with the name of one of
Dewey's men-of-war, would set the
cheers to ringing and handkerchiefs to
waving.
Through the efforts of an army of
fakers visitors were well supplied with
programmes, official, unofficial and
"most complete." They were decorated
with flags, Dewey buttons, diminutive
swords and miniature cannon. Souia
of them wore half a dozen decorations
and were proud of them. They pro
vided themselves with pocket tlaj;s and
with handkerchiefs of patriotic hue.
Most of the decoration is done, and
New York is aglow with prismatic hues.
FOR DEWEY
AND WHEELER
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Sept. 2S.
Editor Horace white of the New
York Evening Post, who is visit
ing friends in this city, is of the
opinion that Admiral Dewey
would not decline the nomination
for President if it were tendered
him. In an Interview to-day he
eaid:
"I have noticed in all the in
terviews Pewey has given on this
subject that while he says he is
a sailor and not In politics and
would not seek the nomination,
he at the same time has not said
he would not accept it. He will
certainly not seek the Domina
tion and will not enter partisan
politics, but I am firmly of the
opinion he would accept the
nomination if tendered him. He
for President and Joe Wheeler
for Vice President is a tirket
that would sweep the country.
Indeed. Dewey would be elected
no matter by what party he was
nominated."
Editor White speaks very en
thusiastically of the possibility
of a Dewey and Wheeler ticket
and does not seem to think it at
all Improbable.2

NEW YORK, Sept. Twelve hun

About 700 of the singers were women.

first number and as soon as it was over
the jackies and officers expressed th"ir
appreciation by three hearty cheers and
a tiger.
Then the flashlights played and

Three cheers arose from th--
Warwick and the 1200 singers broke
f..rth intÂ«> the stirring strain, "See. the
â¢ 'onquering Hero Coined." The band
of the Olympia played "The Star-Span

Warwick joined in and the Olympians
helped the visitors to fill the night
with the magnificent chorus.
"Three cheers for Dewey," Borne one
on the Warwick called and a roar went
ur from the dim dark line along the
rail of the Olympia as well as on the
excursion boat. Tho union then sang
"The Hallelujah Chorus" from Handel's
"Messiah" as the Warwick drew out,
but the anxiety of the lingers to crowd
the boat and get a glimpse of the ad
miral cut the singing short.
Farther away the Warwick drew and
the singers united In the fine music of
"Men of Harleich." That was well
under way wh<'n the national colors
were run up on the stern c-f the Olym
lÂ»ia. and with the searchlights full on
old glory it was gracefully dipped by
May uf. salute and thanks.
The "Star-spangled Banner" again
rang out in swelling chorus and that
â¢was the singers' good-night to the
great admiral.
Then Admiral Sampson's New York
â was sought out, while along the line of
warships, starting with the Olympia,
red and white signal lights winked
busily, passing the word to give the
choral union a fitting reception. But,
whatever the signals, the New York's
crew gave the singers a warm welcome
as they approached singing "The Bat

The New York's searchlights -were
turned on the. singers and then the.vis
itors cheered for Sampson and were an
swered with cheers by the crew. Then
somebody on the "Warwick called out,
"Three cheers for Admiral Schley," and
the answering shouts were fully as loud
as that which went before. Then fol
lowed "The Hymn of Thanks," "Halle

Rear Admiral Howison'a flagship, the

BRILLIANCY
THAT IS MOST
PICTURESQUE
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â The appear
ance of New York harbor to-night
could be compared to a circle of in
tense light, with the -warships off
Tompkinsville as the hub from which
the brilliancy radiated. The bay has
never been as brilliant or as pictur
esque a display of continuous Illumina
tion as that seen to-night, nor has the
Interest manifested by the shore dwell
ers been greater. Beginning at Brook
lyn Bridge, with Its starring of white
jiectrlc lights punctuated at stated
intervals wnn red ana green coiorea
] arch signal lamps, the immense bril
| liant motto "Welcome Dewey" was
s-jsponded as if it â were in midair.
, Looking from the bridge toward the
! Jersey coast similar signs could be dlsÂ»
--' tinctly read on the gateway of the '
railroads that are bringing thousands !
in swell iho pean of welcome to the re
turning warrior. Further down the
bay on the Brooklyn side was the same
: fiery "Welcome." and also on Staten
i Island. At the portal to the city
! shone out in letters of the brightest j
I light the same hearty greeting "Wei- \
come Home," flanked by immense illu- |
! minated American flags that could be j
| seen for miles. The residents at quar
! antine gave for the benefit of the
sailors on the ships a display of fire
works, which was followed by other
patriotic residents along the Brooklyn
and Jersey coasts. After the display
of fireworks the Olympia and New
i ork gave an exhibition with their
searchlights, lighting up passing craft
and picking out in brilliant relief many
iof the pretty wooded spots on the j
Staten Island hills. To-morrow night
the fireworks and illuminations will be
more general.
FORETASTE OF
THE GREAT NAVAL
PAGEANT TO-DAY
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â Thousands
who went down to Staten Island to see
the Olympia and her lighting sisters of
the North Atlantic squadron had a
foretaste of the great naval pageant to
be presented to-day. From early morn
ing until dusk ferryboats were thronged
to their utmost capacity. On all lips
was the name of the Olympia, and as
boats approached the Staten Island
there crowds thronged forward anx
iously to obtain the first view ; of
Dewey's famous flagship. Lying right
off the lighthouse station and at the
end of the long line of warships she
presented the most conspicuous feature
in the picture. Viewed from the broad
bulkhead at St. George, which all day
long was "black! with spectators, the
view was even finer. To complete the
picture there lay within the line of war
ships a magnificent collection of steam
yachts, among which were conspicuous
the Intrepid, Varuna, Aloha, Claremont
and many eitht-r splendid pleasure craft
which will take part in the pageant of
to-morrow. â¢.
At St. George and Tompkinsville
boatmen drove a roaring trade in tak
ing visitors off to the ships. Of these
the Olympia received, of course, the
lion's share. > A brisk wind began to
blow early ' in the afternoon and--soon
kicked up a nasty,, choppy sea 'so that
the rowboats hardly dared^to venture
forth, and patrons of numerous steam
launches , had. to be . content with a
cruise around the ships, the. high sea
making it almost impossible to board
them.

DEWEY PARADE A
AND THE GRAND
ARMY TROUBLE
TOPEKA, Kans., Sept. 28.â General I
: Shaw, national commander in chief of |
i the Grand Army of the Republic, in !
prefacing his address to the veterans i
I at tlu- ritate reunion to-day spoke of I
I the now famous controversy of the
; Grand Army of the Republic with the
Dewey parade managers. He began by 1
characterizing; those having the big
parade in charge as "narrow-minded
blunderers, clothed with a little brief
authority."
He then reviewed the whole matter,
going over the details, which have al
j ready been printed.
"Had a soldier of deeds," he declared,
'"been in the place of General Roe, the
Grand Army would have marched in

General Shaw said that soon Admiral
I Dewey would be invited to visit the
thirty-fourth national encampment to

and unhampered.
The veterans then adopted the fol

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1899.
INSURGENTS
DRIVEN OUT
OF PORAC
Forces Under Mac Arthur and
Wheeler Meet but Slight
Resistance.
FIVE MEN WOUNDED
Rebel Officers Ask the Privilege of
Holding a Conference With
General Otis.
! Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 18'.<8, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MANILA, Sept. 28.â The town of
Porac was taken by forces under Gen
erals Mac Arthur and Wheeler at 9
o'clock this morning. The American
column met with only slight resistance
in its advance ,not more than 400 or 500
insurgents contesting the ground. The
American losses were five men
wounded.
The movement to capture Porac was
begun at 7 o'clock in the morning.
General Mac Arthur with the Thirty
sixth Regiment and General Wheeler
with the Ninth Regiment and a battery
advanced by two roads from Santa
liita, while General Wheaton and Lieu
tenant Colonel Smith, with the Seven
teenth and Twelfth Regiments, moved
from Angeles to intercept the retreat
ing insurgents if possible. .
Before the advance began a tremen
dous demonstration with artillery and
rapid-fire guns was made at Angeles as
a feint against the insurgents along the
line of the railroad on the American
front. Major Baldwin's battalion
guarded the town during the opera
tions. Only small squads of the enemy
were seen, as a rule. As the troops ad
vanced Major Shields and four sol
diers were at a point near the foothills
when they came suddenly into contact
with 150 "insurgents. By firing with
great rapidity they deceived the foe as
to their number and managed to hold
them off.
General Wheaton's attempt to inter
cept the Filipinos on the north resulted
only in the capture of seven armed
men, the high grass through which th â¢â 
insurgents crept hiding them from
view.
The Twelfth Regiment, under Lieu
tenant Colonel Smith, took Manabang,
three miles out of Angeles, and General
Wheeler with the Seventeenth cap
tured the small town of Dolores. Later
the Twelfth had a few minutes' hot
fight with insurgents. None of the
Americans were wounded, but a few
insurgents were killed. After Porac
was captured General Wheaton's force
returned to Angeles.
Two Filipino majors came into the
American lines at nightfall last even
inn with a message saying that about
twenty American prisoners were com
ing in this morning. They requested
that General Alejandrino. with one
colonel and two lieutenant colonels, be
allowed to visit General Otis.
They were refused entrance until 12
o'clock noon on Friday, so as not to
spoil military movements. Only one
general will be permitted to sec- Gen
eral Otis.
SIX OF THE URDANETTA'S
CREW WERE KILLED
MANILA, Sept. 28.â 1t Is reported by a
person who has just arrived from Turdac
that Naval r"adet Welborn C. Wood, who
was in command of the United States
gunboat Urdanetta, recently captured and
5i s'roy, (i by the insurgents on the Oranl
River, on the northwest side of Manila
bay, and five of the nine enlisted men
forming the crew, were killed during the
righting previous to the destruction of
the vessel. ,
The four other men and the captured
ennnonâ a one-pounder, a rapid-fire gun,
a Colt machine-gun and a Nordenfeldt
twenty-live millimeter gun â were con
veyed to Malao.
SILVER FOR THE
REDEMPTION OF BONDS
The Chilean Government Will Prob
ably Make an Issue of Thirty
Thousand Pesos.
Special Cabli' to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gordon
Bennett.
VALPARAISO, Sept. 28.â It is said that
the Government intends to issue 30,000
pesos in silver coins from the redemp
tion on Government bonds. This scheme,
it is believed, will give the coins their
real value. The price of bonds will rise
and the bank rate of interest will fall.
The project will be presented at an
extraordinary session of Congress, when
the Ministry will probably fall. Esti
mates for the War and Marine Depart
ments for the present year, which
amounted to 22.235.594 pesos, have been
reduced for 1900 by 4,723,854 pesos.
HIGHWAYMAN ROBS A

ho covered tho driver and passengers,
telling thf>m that if they wanted to save
th.-ir lives they would have to give up
I heir money.

HAVANA, Sept. 28.â The situation in j
! Havana is calmer this evening; than it j
! has been for several weeks. All the I
Strike leaders have been released. The
daily papers, with the exception of the
i Diffusion, congratulated the Military
! Governor.
The Disrusion says: "It is due to the j
I good sense of the Cubans that a general
I strike has been averted. The action of

DERELICT LOG RAFT
FOUND BY THE RESCUE
Was Adrift About Thirty Miles Off Point
Conception and Is in Good
Condition.
9 SAN LUTS OBISBO, Sept. 28.â The big log raft which broke loose off
O Cape Mendocino on September 7, while in tow of the steamer Czarina,
0 from Puget Sound, was found by the tug Rescue this morning off Lompoc
Â»S Landing, about thirty miles north of Point Conception. The Rescue towed
the raft to the bay of San Luis Ooispo at Port Harford. The monster
float seems to be in first-class shape, and none the worse for its ocean
Â»* wanderings.
4 i It has been a menace to all coast vessels, and a constant lookout had
0 been kept for it. So heavy and cumbersome is the raft that it would have
& in all probability wrecked any vessel that might have struck it. The raft
O is 625 feet long and 60 feet wide, and constructed in cigar shape. It con
â¦^ tains 7,000,000 feet of timber and drew twenty-six feet of water. The tug
fy Rescue encountered considerable trouble in making fast to it, and it was
O only after an hour's hard work that she succeeded.
The tug Monarch has gone to the assistance of the Rescue. No
chances will be taken in bringing the raft to San Francisco. Should
it continue to blow a start will not be made until a calm prevails and
should it begin to blow while the tugs and tow are en route shelter will
be sought in the nearest harbor. It is expected that the tugs will take
at least four days to bring the raft to San Francisco.

MAP OF THE TRANSVAALâ NATAL BORDER.
On either BirJe of the border the Boers and the British forces are posted,
and a clash may occur at any moment
j riously they would venture upon it. wel
! regret to say that this last effort has
been broken down, since Lord Palis
bury cannot go behind Mr. Chamberlain
without creating a Cabinet crisis.
"It is deplorable, nevertheless, that
state etiquette should be strong enough
to obstruct the path of peace. We
hope it Is not true that Mr. Chamber
lain intends to demand disarmament,
a heavy Indemnity and the withdrawal
of Dr. Leyds, which could only result
in war."
The paper suggests that the Orange
Free State should appeal for arbitra
tion under the arrangements con
cluded at The Hague.
The Press Association Issues the fol
lowing statement this evening: "We
learn that the centers of Interest in the
Transvaal crisis are in reality at Lis
bon and Berlin, and this consideration,
It is thought in some quarters, may
cause a further" adjournment of the
Cabinet.
"The future administration and
financial control of the Portuguese
possessions in South Africa are neld !â >
be an integral factor in the present
difficulty-. The friends of President
Kruger urge that it would be manifest
ly unfair to insist upon a partial re
duction of the forts at Pretoria and
Johannesburg so long as Lorenzo Mar
ques remains under the Portuguese
i Government, and it Is probable that
th~ negotiations between London. Ber
lin and Lisbon may not llu concluded
until after the Cabinet council."
The Odessa correspondent of the
Standard telegraphs a rumor thai
Germany recently suggested to Russia
'the advisability of mediation between
Great Britain and the Transvaal and
that Russia declined to have anything
to do with the matter.
WELLINGTON, X. Z.. Sept. 28.â The
Government of this colony decided to
day to equip and send a force of 200

step was decided upon.
CONTEST OVER THE
DIOCESAN COMMITTEE
Election at the Protestant Episcopal
Convention Results in Sustain-
ing the Bishop.
NEW YORK. Sept. 2.S.â The second
day's session of the annual conference
of the Protestant Episcopal church of the
diocese of New York brought out the
expected contest over the election of the
diocesan standing committee, the so
called high church party opposing the re
election of lant year's committee because
it had presented Rev. Dr. Briggs for
ordination to the priesthood.
The high church faction endeavored to
carry through the ticket nominated at
their meeting last Monday night, with the ;
exception that the name of Captain A. T. i
Mahaii was withdrawn. The old com
miUÂ»-Â«Â» was also renominated.
While the tellers were at work on the
vote, Rev. Dr. Morgan Dix. chairman of
the committee of nine, to whom that part
of Bishop Potter's address which related
to marriage, divorce and the observance
of Sunday was referred, read the com
mittees report. They approved Bishop
Potter's views and expressed themselves
as "glad ami thankful that trie Bishop
had laid his hands upon two of the
greatest evils of the home."
The vote on the standing committee
resulted in the re-election of the old com
mittee, thus sustaining Bishop Potter.
The high church faction mustered about
a third of the members. There was no
excitement.

were plbced on sale In a book store, it
being deemed best apparently not to put
them in the hands of druggists. The evi

denial of the charges against them, but
were unable to controvert the testimony.

TERMS OF. NOTARIES.
A few days ago Governor Gage caused
considerable stir by revoking the commis
sions of a number of notaries public and
many more felt that they would !â â â 
obliged to walk the same plank. In or
der to learn as to the power of the Gov
ernor to make such removals from of
fice several inquiries were made of At
torney General Tirey I>. Ford as v> tin
law on the matter. Mr. Ford and Deputy
Abbott searched the statutes and found
that prior to IÂ£9l notaries public were ap
pointed for four years. The Legislature
of 1593 amended the statutes and omitted
to six the term for this class of officials.
In 189$ the lawmakers again amended the
same, restoring the four-year term. The
Attorney General sums up his conclusions
as follows:
Section 793 of the Political ("ode would be
made to read "The term of offlre of a Notary
Public Is four years from and after the date
of his commission." I am therefore of the
opinion that the office of aÂ«N'otary Public, ap
pointed after the act of 1893 went into effr . t
and before the act nf 1899 took effect. Is held
at the pleasure of the appointing power, name
ly the Governor, and that section 733 of the
Political Code does not apply to notaries pub
lic so appointed, but to those only who were
appointed after the act of 1599 took effect.

FIGHTS THAT
DO NOT RUN
TO THE LIMIT
Four Bcuts at the San Fran
cisco Club That Are Gen
uine Fistic Battles.
There wasn't much "how-do-you-do"
and "glad-to-s'ee-you" about the four
i fights last night at the San Francisco
! Athletic Club. It was all hammer and
1 tongs from the clang of the gong, and the
crowd that packed the benches was duly
pleased.
The vent of the evening was an eight
round go between Eddie Toy and Charles
Vickers, 136 pounds. Both men lasted the
limit, and after a whirlwind affair of
punches and a bit of rough-and-tumble
Alec Greggains, who refereed all the
fights, gave the contest to Toy. Not a
moment was wasted in the eight rounds,
both pugilists working lists, arms and legs
as if iheir salvation depended upon an
excess of pugilistic effort. The decision,
which was a just one, was not well re
ceived by the house, and a storm of his.-,
followed it. .- .
The announced fight between Gassman
; and Johnson was declared off on account
â  of the non-appearance of both contest
! ants. In their place Arthur Granfleld and
â  Kid Mem mixed -themselves up for .-lx
rounds.. The contest was to be an eight
round affair, but Metn thought he had
! enough 't the end of the sixth, and as
Ihe "kick"'!" to " the referee about the
other two rounds Grcggains promptly
called the fight off and "gave it to Gran
field, the favorite and the pluckier list
worker. '
1 Jack MoMahon and Mike Molllss, both of
the San Francisco Athletic Club and 133
--pound fighters, then crossed mits and
treated the spectators to the most scien
tific battle of the night's entertainment.
McMahon's cleverness and experience
proved too big a wall for Molliss to scale,
and the third round saw the end of the
fight. MolliSÃ was on his way to the land
where Bleep reigns when Greggains
stepped in and called the Journey off.
"Mike" McClure and "Billy" Kennedy
made three rounds of swings and passes.
McClure was speedy of foot and fist, and
Kennedy tell up against the latter very
often. Three rounds of hard going satis
fled both referee and public, and the game
Was called with Me' 'lure under the wire.

ation Fortunate.
The horse I Don't Know, hero of half a |
hundred turf scandals, is racing here once j
more.- The bay son of Villard first made
the acquaintance ot local turf patrons at
the old Bay District track some five
years ago. At his first essay he was not
meant, for his rider, an elongated "hush"
jockey named Garrison, never gave the
sprinter his head. Next time out he "won j
a block" and horse, owner and Jockey
Garrison were ruled off the turf, which
edict sent the late lamented "King" Jlc-
Manus on the warpath. After a time I I
Don't Know was reinstated and next
bobbed up at Ingleside track. Again he
figured in a shady looking race, causing
Jockey Morse to be ruled off. Some
months later the same horse waa the
nvians of Starter Jim Ferguson engaging
in a war of words with his owner, Breed,
at Anaconda during the season of IÂ»9S.
Yesterday the oduly named sprinter
started in the second event at Oakland,
and with Thorpe on his back was played
down from threes to 8 to 5 favoritism. He
acted like a real gentleman, winning clev
erly from the Spreckels entry, Monrovia.
Billy A, a 30 to 1 s.hot, fast as a ghost, led ;
until within less than a furlong from the <
plate, where he collapsed like a hot air j
balloon.
It was the best card yet presented at
Oakland, and the sport was above the
average. First choices were prime, bring- I
ing top market prices, and got home lirst
on four occasions.
The most fortunate purse-getter of the
afternoon was Recreation, winner of the
closing seven furlong run. A furlong from
the wire Thorpe looked hopelessly pock
eted, when suddenly the veteran saw a
streak of daylight and took a chance. He
wiggled through the crevasse and at the
wire led Opponent out a length. Nar
vaez, on the latter, used no .discretion
throughout the voyage. Manzanllla, a 60 i
to 1 shot, suddenly became imbued with
speed, running a spanking good race.
Pat Ryan's fast mare Afamada was-as
suredly the choice of the opening dash,
and backed to 9 to 20 favoritism experi
enced no difficulty in winning hands down ;

Track Notes.
Governor Smith of Montana and Tom
McTague, one of the wardens of the
penitentiary at Deer Lodge, in that State,
were spectators at the track yesterday.
Mr. McTague was owner of the mare Ma
rietta, which won a race at the Bay Dis
trict track some years ago at odds of
mo to 1.
The horses of Ed Corrigan passed Oak- j
land track on a special train Wednesday

a four-year-old mare by Tenny, while in 1
the ESast. He also lost by death his good
performer Rey de] Tlerra at Saratoga.
Billy A. which showed such a phenom
enal flight of speed in the dash won by
I Don't Know, was purchased by Dave
Fountain at Denver during the June
meeting held in that city. He is said to
be a maiden.
After the Recreation race Charley
Thorpe said it was seldom he took such
a chance, but could it resist it on that
occasion. Eddie Greaney, owner of Op
ponent, told Thorpe he was sorry he
changed his tactics.
Bookmaker "Hughey" Jones is the
latest arrival. He dropped in from St.
Louis yesterday, but his horses will not
be here for a week or so. Hughey made
several fair-sized "killings" on Sly, the
Racine mare, owned by Hanlon Bros.
Little "Jimmy" Walsh, who rode Afa
mada, left the maiden jockey class with
that mare's victory in the opening event.
He was in the employ of Nathan Lands
berg last winter, going to the post twenty
times without scoring a win. P. Ryan
has taken a fancy to the little chap, and
says he will place him aboard twenty
winners before the season is over.
Morinel promises to be as good as last
year. Mat Storn paid before the race
yesterday the mare had not stepped
a mile better than l:4. >. but he expected
her to make, a good showing at that. She
led the well-backed Lodestar out for
the show. ,

James Carr, better known as "Jim"
Carr, a saloon-keeper at the corner of
Suttcr street and Central avenue and at
one time a local pugilist, died at St.
Mary's Hospital yesterday afternoon of
heart disease. Carr was well known in
San Francisco as a sport, but was obliged
to retire from the ring on account of his
ailment. Since thftt time he had been
encased in the liquor business. He was
taken ill suddenly yesterday morning and
was at once taken to the hospital, where
he expired a few hours later. He was 42
years of age.

MADRONO TARES
THE PUCE OF
THE LIGHTSHIP
Vessels Will Now Be
Able to Find Port.
Shipowners and master mariners who
have been vigorously protesting for a week
past because Lightship 70 was brought In
f.ir repairs during the heaviest fog seen
on tliH*coÂ»st this year are now appeased.
The lighthouse tender Madrono has taken
the place of the can buoy that marked
the place where the lightship was. and
will in future blow a blast of two seconds'
duration with a thirteen-second interval.
The Call was the frst to voice the pro
test of shipping men, and at the time
suggested that the Madrono be pent out
to till the lightship's place. The article
was sent East by Lighthouse Inspector
Sebree, and the result was instructions to
anchor the Madrono on the bar in the
lightship's place. The Madrono is painted
drab, with white upper works. At night,
besides the whistles, she will show two
white lights on her masthead.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Curacao arrived from Mexican ports yes
terday. She was a day behind her sched
ul> time on account of the celebration of
Mexican independence at Santa Rosalia.
No work was done that day, so the vessel
had to wait for her cargo. A crew of
Mexican sailors for the new schooner
Alba, just completed at Benicia. came up
on the Curacao. Captain Edrulfo Pena
will command the new boat, and he and
his men will sail her to Mazatlan.
Among the steerage passengers was a
Miss Seen, who claimed to be a Japanese
but looked like a Chinese. She was
dressed in European clothes but could not
Bpeak English or Spanish. A Chinese who
happened to be on the wharf was brought
aboard the Curacao, and with him the
girl talked fluently in Chinese. Miss Seen
Dad in her possession a letter from Mins
Cameron of the Presbyterian Mission, but
it shed no light on the nationality of the
girl. Immigration Inspector de la Torre
decided not to-land Miss Seen until satis
fied as to her nationality.
The new steel shin Arthur Sewall, which
arrived from Philadelphia a few days ago,
is the only vessel in the United States
that has stationary topsail yards. This
does away with reefs, 'halyards, ties,
sheaves and blocks and effects a saving
of over $1000 a -ear in wear an.l tear. All
that requires to be done is to clew the
sails up, and that is the end of the mat
ter. Men along the front call it Captain
Murphy's patent, and the idea, being a
good one, is sure to be followed by all
shipowners who want to economize in the
working expenses of their ships.
A diver was down examining the hull
Of the Sewall yesterday. One uf the riv
ets has worked loose, and the vessel is
leaking a little.
The stern-wheel steamer Mary Ellen
Galvin is coming out of retirement at
Benicia. and will be sold at auction next
week on the water Â£ront. The steamer
was built for "I'ai" Galvin, one of the
Klondike millionaires, (luring the boom.
No expense was spared In fitting her out,
but when it cam' 1 to the trial trip the
steamer was not a success. Sho did not
develop the required speed, and when
m,. asured it was found she drew too much
water for the Yukon River. "Pat" Gal
vin refused to accept the vessel, and a
number of lawsuits followed. For months
the Mary Ellen Galvin was tied up at
various wharves along the front in charge
of a deputy Sheriff, and twice she broke
adrift during southeaster*. Finally she
was sent to Benicia about two years ago,
and has lain there ever since.
The British ship Earl of Dunmore sailed
for London yesterday with a general
cargo valued at nearly $400,000. The canned
fruit alone was worth $551,429, canned sal
mon $71,260, wine $10,1 it..". brandy $4730, and
barley $10,000.
The bark Mauna Ala, which arrived
from Honolulu Wednesday night, brought
up eleven ostriches for the ostrich farm
in Southern California. The birds behaved
well during the trip, but the sailors had
to keep well out of their reach. Every
thing' went Tvith Mr. Ostrich, from a
needle to a marlinspike. while a jack
knife was considered a delicacy. The
birds will be shipped south at once.
The steamer Coptic cannot carry all the
freight offering, and over 500 Chinese will
go home on her to celebrate the new year.
Chief Officer Frank Hart has sailed for
England to take command of one of the
White Star steamers.
Captain Gray of the Merchants' Tow
boat Company received a telegram from
Captain Thompson of the tug Rescue yes
terday, announcing that the derelict log
raft which broke away from the Czarina
some weeks ago had been found and
towÂ«d into Port Hartford.
The revenue cutter Richard Rush, Cap
tain Cushing, arrived in # the bay yester
day morning after a run of eleven days
from Dutch Harbor, Alaska.
Captain Cushing reports that when he
left Dutch Harbor the British steamer
Port Albert was there with a load of
horses on her way to Manila, and the
Portland, which wns also in the harbor,
was soon to leave for this city. The The
tis was to follow the latter vessel on the
16th of this month.
The crew of the Rush say they have had
a hard and disagreeable cruise and are
mighty glad to get home again.
HOSKIH'S FIGHT
PROVED FATAL
Died Without Regaining
Consciousness.
Special Disuatch to The CalL
GRASS VALLEY, Sept. 28.â Despite the
fact that everything in the range of
possibility was done to save the life of
Charles Hoskin, who received a fatal
blow in the contest last night with James
IVndergast, he died at 7 o'clock this
morning. From the very moment the
fatal blow waÂ« .-struck he never regained
consciousness. He had said to his wlfÂ«
that this was to be his last fight, little
thinking of the untimely end that was to
be his lot.
The shocking tragedy has had a de
pressing effect on the whole community,
and was the sole topic of conversation to
day. No one suffered greater anguish
outside the immediate relatives than
Pendergast, whose fatal blow in
responsible for sending his victim to
eternity.
A post-mortem examination held late
this afternoon developed the fact that
blood clots two inches in diameter had
formed on each side of the head. Bruises
were also found on each side of thÂ©
temple, one below the eye and one on the
back of tho head. The injuries were
caused by Hoskin's head striking the
floor, which was not properly padded.
Hoskin was 38 years of ace and a
native of this city. Penderg-ast has been
released on his own recognizance. Publia
sentiment is so wrought up that the City-
Trustees will meet Monday night and
pass an ordinance fixing the license at
JIOOO for future boxing contests, -which
will have the effect of suppressing- them.

A PUZZLING CIPHER CODE
HOW CONVICTS PLOTTED MUR
DER BETORE THEIR VICTIMS.
Incorrigibles Passed Notes and
Talked Freely, Notwithstanding
They Were in Solitary
Confinement.
When the full details of the plrrt of Vie
two convicts confined in the incorrigible
cells at San Quentin Prison, by which
they expected to murder a number ol
guards and make their escape, as told
exclusively In yesterday's Call, are known
the hideous side of the conspiracy is al
most lost sight of in wonder at the in
genuity displayed by the prisoners in com
municating with one another and the per
fection of the system adopted, by which
they were able to talk of butchering a
man in his very presence without creating
any apprehension that anything was
going wrong.
Warden Agulrre has succeeded In break-
Ing "Sir" Harry Cooper's spirit so thor
oughly that the prisoner, reticent as an
j oyster prior to his acquaintance with the
I straitjacket, now seems to be eager to see
for himself if a free confession is not good
for the body as well as the soul. Cooper
\ has even shown how he and Morrell man
! aged to write notes and pass them from
j one cell to another, a feat by no means
the least of those performed by the in
; mates of the incorrigible ward In arrang
ing their dastardly plans.
Some time ago Convict Bullock asked
Warden Aguirre for a slate and pencil and
a work on arithmetic. Baying that he
desired to widen his knowledge along

mathi matlcnl lines. Relieving that a slate
; could be broken and used for a purpose
detrimental to discipline, the Warden
gave him the stub of a lead pencil and a
few sheets of paper instead. Cooper ac
quired a small piÂ«-ce of pencil and some
paper on thÂ«* pretense of amusing himself
by writing v^rse. These pencils and paper
were used in communicating with one. an
other.
In passing the notes from one cell to
another the convicts chose a time when
'â  no guard was in the vicinity, and attach
| ing a weight to the note to be passed, tied
B string to the bundle and swung it back
and forth until the momentum would < :<r
ry the package in front of the next cell.
The inmate would re,ach through the bars
and catch it. only to send It on to the
man for whom it was Intended In the
same way. It is needless to add that
these men will be permitted no more pen
cils or paper In order to repeat their per
formance. Warden Aguirre is of humane
mind and desirous of treating the "incor
! rigibles" as well as he can, in view of
their fate being hard at the best, but he
: says now that he knows when he "gets
| too much of a good thing."
The cipher code invented by Cooper is
not only simple in the extreme, but by
the expedient of dropping one letter out
of the alphabet is made practically Greek
;to the uninitiated. The key to the code
is arranged in the form of a square, mak
j ing it possible for a mm to lay it before
\ him and in a short time to converse fiu
j ently with anybody familiar with the
I code.
"There Is only one objection I have to
this conspiracy becoming public prop
erty," said Warden Agulrre yesterday.
"and that is that when the large body of
I convicts become acquainted with the de
tails of the affair there is always a ten
dency on their part to glorify the prison
ers in the incorrigible cell as martyrs One
good effect of publicity, however, will be
to show those humanitarians who have
been making a howl about the incorrigible
ward on account of the misrepresenta
tions inserted in several of the city papers
that wo know here a good deal more
about dealing with such hardened char
acters than anybody else possibly can."

The Board of Harbor Commissioners
met in special session yesterday after
noon to consider the proposal to change
t ; lt . specifications for the construction of
the Main street ferry slip by substituting
wooden stave cylinders for steel cylln
' ders. The board was inclined to ignore
the protest of the. unsuccessful biiMrrs
and order the change, as it was shown
that by so doing a saving of $1200 would
be made to the State, and ex-Governor
, Budd. counsel for the board, who was
-, â  Bent, advised the Commissioners that
they had ample authority for such action.
; However, in view of the fact that the
Santa Fe is anxious to have the slip com
pleted by the first of the year, whi^h
1 would be impossible if the board should
be me involved in litigation over the
I matter, the board decided not to make th<Â»
change at the same time placing Itself I
j on record as approving the recommenda
tion of Chief Engineer Holmes.

Mayor Phelan then delivered the ad
dress of the evening and spoke of the
necessity of supporting such institu
tions as the one over which Father
Crowley presides. He/.ook occasion to
pay a glowing tribute to the latter's
self-sacrificing devotion in the cause to
which he had consecrated his best en
ergies. He concluded by advising his
hearers to contribute generously to

MONTANA AT ORPHEUM.
It was Montana night at the Orpheum
last evening and the audience was en
livened by the presence of two or three
hundred of the men from the mining re
gions. They were liberal with their ap
plause, and the enthusiasm they showed
became contagious after a while and put
vigor to the applause of the casual thea
tergoer. The height of the enthusiasm
was reached when â  the band began a
medley of patriotic airs. There were cheers
and yells as the musicians ran the gamut
from "Yankee Doodle" to "Dixie." and
then at the "Star Spangled Banner" every
one gave a shout,, and then the people
rose to their feet and stood in silence
while the grand old tune . was being
played. Then the cheers started again,
nor did they cease until the programme
proceeded. _^_^___^^^____

Three rings and a platform, not count
ing the "in betweens" â the embarrass
ment of riches, but rivet your intelligence
on the hither ring and you will see enough
to realize that the habit of long prayer
and a well-stocked liniment chest are
fit preparation for a circus life. The lini
ments are looked to, but the remedies do
not "insist upon their diseases." Bruise
and break are foolish acts of unwisdom.
The champion female equestrian and all
the lesser ones leap gayly on their horses
and ballasted with red or pink or white
fluffiness ride recklessly over, under or
through any difficulty, at any angle, at
any speedâ nothing interrupts their in
tentions or interferes with their profes
sional manner. The crack of the ring
master's whip or the crack of doomâ it
is all one. Between their acts you will
find them seated in the big dressing-room
amid a bewilderment of sawdust and
spangles, doing dainty silken embroidery

THE GENSS CONCERT
WAS WELL ATTENDED
A large audience attended the soner re
cital of Hermann Genss at Sherman-Cay
Hall last evening. The gentleman, who in
troduced himself to the music lovers of
this city as an excellent pianist, did not
duplicate his former successes, for as a
vocalist he is certainly not entitled to the
same praise. That Mr. Genss is a thor
ough musician he has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of all those who have heard
him. but that he does not know that he
lacks a sufficiently resonant . and firm
barytone is indeed surprising. Mr. Gc-nas
carries testimonials with him which pro
nounce him an efficient vocalist, and It
may be that in his day he was exceedingly
satisfactory. It is, however, equally true
that to-day he does not possess those
qualities which would make him a
prominent concert soloist: His voice lacks
color above all things. It Is true he uses
great care in interpretation and his pro
nunciation is splendid, but whether or not
it is a result of the excitement and worry
connected with every first appearance,
there were occasions when his attack was
not sure.
It is a painful and at the same time a
disagreeable task to be obliged to tell
these things to an experienced musician,
but Mr. Gcnss himself knows these as
sertions are based upon facts. As a
pianist he stands in the front rank, but
as a vocalist he does not give satisfaction.
Mr. Genss was assisted by Miss Margaret
Bruntsch, who possesses a splendid voice,
and Mrs. Strelltz-Uavis.

famous African expeditions In '&3 and '95.
The lecture to-night, for the ben

THE EMPORIUM.
ST. BRENDAN'S FAIR
IS IN FULL SWING
i
â  LADIES OF THE PARISH PAID
; MANY COMPLIMENTS.
Father Wyman Delivers the Opening
; Address and Takes Occasion to
Review the Labors of
Father Nugent.
The fair in aid of a fund to lift the
1 street improvement debt for St. Brendan's
! Church was opened last night at St. Bren
dan's Hall. Fremont and Harrison streets,
, and the ladies of the parish had occasion.
i I to feel well satisfied before the night was
j over that their efforts for success were
i freely appreciated. The hall, with its gay
; booths, its whei 1 of fortune and its fount
ains nf cooling drinks, was as pretty as a
I picture even before the doers were opened,
j and when th>- early crowÂ«VÂ« began to pour
j in its beaVy grew.
The pretties! and eleven^ girls in the
j parish were everywhere, aiding and abet
! ting their mothers In the laudable assault
jon the visiting pocketoook. They sold
everything and chances on everything,
j from popcorn to a kiss at the bit of blar-
I ney stone that is bound to prove a star
attraction of the fair. It is a chip off the
I old rock, and can be depended upon to
loosen tongues as painlessly as the ladies
of the fair loosen purse strings.
The formal exercises attending the open
ing were brief. Shortly after 8 o'clock
Father Nugent introduced Father Wyman
I of old St. Mary's, who had been invited to
' deliver the address of the evening. The
! eloquent Paulist was greeted with ap-
I plause.
"It seems to me." he said, after a few
I preliminary remarks, "that Father Nu
! gent is worthy of especial honor because
he is the only partor of a church in this
part of the city who is the founder of his
parish."
The parishioners thought so too. and
i they proceeded to testily to the sentiment
with applause. Father Wyman reviewed
! the history of the parish and told how it
! had grown, with a church and a parochial
residence, free of debt, and a school al
i most free, under the nourishing hand of
the pastor. He called upon all to aid the
fair, which was then declared formally
opened; and if the first night is any mdi.
. cation it will be a great success. The la
j dies in charge of the booths are:

Salmon Fishers Arrested
The State law prohibits the takinpr of
salmon between September 10 and Octo
ber 10. in order to allow these fish to go
up the rivers to the spawning grounds.
Otherwise ihey would not be able to get
past the fishermen's nets, so numerous
would the obstructions be In the upper
hay and rivers. However, a number of
lawless fishermen are determined to fish
and some have come to grief. Two days
ago one of the latter was arrested for
having salmon In his possession, and yes
terday Deputy John Davis arrested Sal
vador'e Rappo for the same offen6e at the
mouth of Pelican slough. He was taken
to Suisun for trial.

STORAGE OF FLOOD WATERS
THE constantly increasing experience of Califor
nia confirms the policy of absolute avoidance of
droughts. They are not more frequent. The
- Â»ge rainfall of any decade is undiminished, but
! the water is wasted. It irrigates no fields, orchards
ior vineyards. It turns no wheel, supplies no mine,
:cs no wealth. With a potentiality capable of
"asurab'.e multiplication of the State's wealth, of
increasing its homes, raising the products of agri
â  ulture and pasture to a vast volume,
of keeping even- ipine in action every day in the
ter runs to waste and destroys as it goes.
â razed at the spectacle Principalities of
lie idle or yield crops uncertainly for lack of
'â :. Mines employing thousands of men, yielding
of gold and furnishing a near and ready mar
: :ood products the land would raise, are idle
: the year for lack of water.
At the same time, ever/ year, trillions of cubic
Is of the needed water run uselessly .down the
mountains, flood the valleys and are lost in the sea!
For a long tiir.e there has existed a movement based
i 011 the hope that the Federal Government could be
I induced to impound this wasted water and distribute
r use. But the Federal Government has many
calls upon it. Those which are answered are such as
interest that part of the Union where its political
: power lies.
There are nine States in which this waste of water
is a vital matter. They are California, Colorado,
Idaho, Montana, Nevada. Oregon, Utah, Washing
ton and Wyoming. But they are represented in Con
gress by only thirty-six Senators and Representatives,
against' 411 for the rest of the Union, and have a
total population of only 2,814.402, against 59,807.848
the States not directly concerned. The center of
population in 1890 was twenty miles east of Colum
bus. Indiana, nearly three thousand miles from San
.:. cisco. A study of these statistics reveals the
hopelessness of further appeal to the Federal Govern
ment for money to save flood waters for the benefit
of our industries. The Irrigation Congress, inaugur
ated several years ago at Salt Lake and still in ex
istence, has from the first prayed toward Washington
the Mecca where our salvation lies, but without re-
The time has come when California, at least,
â  â¢ cease invoking the gods and put her own
:!der to the wheel. The Federal Government has
eyed a number of reservoir sites in this State
ere flood waters may be impounded and thence
distributed. A movement has been for some months
foot to secure State action. This is to be in the
:e of bond ' I these reservoirs and
provide distribution of the water to the canals and
â¢â¢ prepared nr to be prepared. For the
I the State's share in its distribution, a pries
red which will meet the interest on the
bonds and provide a sinking fund against maturity of
the principal. When the revenues of the plant have
-ate will tax the users of the water
pay the co<n of maintenance only.
Tin- en, will be guaranteed by the State and
1 secured on the water property which they create. An
inspection of the rainfall tables for fifty years, pre
pared by Mr. W. li. Mills, will -how th.it with such
m in action California will never know a
drought. Of all our rainfall and moisture only about
1 per cent is saved in the normal flow oÂ£ streams to
be available tor irrigation, mining and other economic
uses. As our mountains are stripped of their timber
this percentage will grow less, for the rainfall runs
more immediately into the stream?, which become tor
r the time, and is lost, whilÂ« aridity increases
in thr ining is impeded
more and more for lack of water.
With a storage system in operation, the normal
flow of the streams now in use would nnt be inter
fered with, but the fl<;od water which is wasted would
be stored. Its inconceivably vast quantity would not
only bring into action millions of acres now idle,
keeping them steadily productive, but in dry seasons
would supplement the lessened normal flow of the
streams and keep the whole irrigable area of the
valleys and foothills in full production and unlimited
fniitfulness. The project is easily possible. It is
practical. It is necessary. One has to go outside
of all practical and feasible and economic considera
tion? to find any objection to it. All admit its de-
sirability, and none object to the Federal Govern
ment doing it. That being impossible because of the
political power of a population that is either indiffer
ent or has adverse interests, are we to stand and dry
up in our tracks, a desiccated monument to a stub
born determination not to help ourselves?
When a convention is held to consider this subject
and formulate plans to effect this purpose we hope
that banking and business circles will be roused to
their interest in common with the miner, the agricul
turist, horticulturist and lumberman, without whom
there can be neither banks nor business.
Further appeal for Federal money is useless. A
Federal department has been beseeched in vain to
give us the very inexpensive help of observation sta-
ns, of the signal service, on the Aleutian archi
| pelago, that we might be notified when by deflection
of its course the Japan current parts with its warmth
and moisture in Bering Sea, and reaches us under
ron -evaporating conditions, producing a dry season.
But our prayer fell upon deaf ears, while the same de
partment secured from Congress all the money
needed to put stations on all the West Indian islands
in order to warn the shipping on the Atlantic sea
i board of the hurricanes which destroy it. That was
necessary- and we make no complaint, but why should
much less be refused to us? When we decide to pro
tect ourselves, by providing water that enables us to
defy the seasons, we will no longer need to implore
assistance at a source that is indifferent or antagon
istic.
It is anounced that Dan Burns, for the sake of
harmony, will sacrifice his personal ambition to be
come a United States Senator. It would be fairer to
say that Dan Burns, for the sake of decency, will re
tire from a contest in which only his monumental
presumption that he was qualified to represent any
body gave him a standing.
THE EXPANSION OF FOREIGN TRADE
STATISTICS of foreign trade recently issued by
the Government are in the highest degree grati
fying. The total exports for the month of
August are 25 per cent higher than for the same
month last year, when they were the highest known,
and they are 33 per cent higher than the average in
the same month for the three ye^rs 1894-95-96. For
the first eight months of the calendar year they are
the highest in the history of the country.
It is also to be noted that along with the increase
of exports there has been a marked increase of
imports. The time when we were so much in debt
to Europe that the nations of that continent could
pay for our goods by simply sending back American
securities has gone by. We are now virtually out of
debt. In fact, several times of late the United States
has financed Europe, and New York has made great
strides toward taking the place cjf London as the
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1899.
j money center of the world. As a result of this con
! dition of affairs our foreign commerce increases in
i both directions. The imports for August exceeded
I those for the corresponding month of labt year by
j upward of 30 per cent, and those of 1597 by nearly ~o
per cent.
It will be seen from these reports that while the
foolish imperialists are under the impression that we
must have an imperial system of military conquest in
order" to expand our trade, that trade is going for
ward by leaps and bounds. It has been advanced by
the resistless impulses of industry. It is the offspring
of peace and not of war, and should the jingoes come
into power their policies would injure more than
help it.
The one defect in the splendid showing is that this
growing commerce is carried on almost wholly in for
eign ships. It is under an alien flag our exports are
sent abroad and our imports brought back. Our in
crease of trade means an increase of a foreign mer
chant marine, and out of the profits of our labor a
b.rge sum has to be taken every day in the year to pay
the foreign ship-owner for the cost of transportation.
In a recent address on the 'subject Senator Frye
said: '"'lt is imperatively required we should carry
in our own ships under our own flag all our imports
and exports. We should pay to our people the
$100,000 a day we now pay to foreigners. We should
make of the officers of these ships active, intelligent
and interested agents for the discovery of new mar
kets and the promotion of our trade. Suppose to
accomplish it does cost us $10,000,000 annually, will
there not be ample compensation?"
That is the issue presented to the people of the
United States in the evidences given of our expand
ing commerce. We hear much in these days of trade
j following the flag. Should not the flag follow trade?
Where our goods are going our flag and our mer
, chant ships should go. Surely every intelligent
student of events can perceive how important it is at
; this time to provide for the upbuilding of a merchant
marine that shall be equal to the requirements of our
commerce.

"California Municipalities," a new magazine de- i
voted to the affairs of municipal government in this '
State, opens the current number, which, by the way, j
is the second issue of the publication, with an excel- '
lent article on "Municipal Accounting," by Mayor j
Snow of Oakland, and contains many other papes
of hardly less interest and importance to all concerned
in the administration of cities. The magazine fills a j
useful place in the discussions of the day and merits j
a liberal support.
ALLEGATIONS OF CONSPIRACY.
WAYNE MACVEAGH, in his argument on be
half of Colonel Carter before Attorney General
Griggs on Wednesday, asked for a judicial
hearing of the case before a civil tribunal, and, with
out charging the members of the court-martial with
any offense other than that of unfitness for trying such
a case as that presented, intimated that a conspiracy
exists among persons of power and influence to
prejudice the country against Carter and to procure
his conviction by foul means.
In dealing with that phase of the subject MacVeagh
is reported to have recited eleven instances of what
he termed "positive inventions" to the injury of the
accused, retailed to correspondents of newspapers
during the past eighteen months, and to have an
nounced that sooner or later he expects to reveal the
authors of these reports, expose their motives and
hold somebody responsible for them. lie is further
reported as intimating that the inventions emanated
from the War Department, and to have stated plainly
that the findings of the court-martial were not made
unanimously, despite the announcement of the War
Department to that effect.
Such intimations of conspiracy as are contained in
these carefully guarded words derive weight from the
fact of their utterance by an attorney of high repute
and of known integrity. They give something of
confirmation to the many stories circulated concern
ing the alleged conspiracy against Carter, and will in
cline the public to believe there is good foundation
for them. If false reports of the case to the detriment
of the accused man have been traced to the depart
ment whose officials are in close relations to the mem
bers of the court-martial that tried him, it is clear a
new trial by a different tribunal should be given if
for no other purpose than that of removing suspicion
from the public mind and making it clear that justice
has been done.
The outbursts of public indignation in this country
over the Dreyfus case show how sensitive we are
when injustice is committed by the military tribunals
of a foreign state, and it is hardly likely we can be
less sensitive concerning an allegation of injustice by
a similar court in our own land.
Direct charges that the conviction of Colonel Carter
was brought about by a powerful corporation whose
frauds he intended to expose have now been made
by several responsible persons, and Attorney Mac-
Veagh has intimated that the War Department offi
cials if not in the conspiracy, are at least subject to its
influences and have worked in its behalf to the extent
of issuing lies to newspaper correspondents. It h
nearly two years since the court-martial reported Car
ter to be guilty of the serious charges against him, and
yet during all that time he has not been punished. He
continues to enjoy his liberty, his rank and his pay.
Why has the penalty decreed by the court not been
carried out by the Government? Is it that Carter is
supported by friends so strong that justice cannot
reach him even though he be guilty, or is it that there
are reasons to believe him wrongfully convicted?
Whichever view of the case be taken justifies the re
quest for a. trial before a civil tribunal. The facts
should be made known. We cannot afford to have a
Dreyfus case in the United States.
The National Irrigation Congress, which has just
dosed its eighth annual session at Missoula, Mont.,
has solemnly decided that the tilling of the soil must
be taken out <Ji the hands of the lawyers. Is it pos
sible that the learned gentlemen of the bar have been
, forced to the recourse of hard work or is this an
; other slander upon the abused profession?
The Governor has announced that the Man from
I Mexico has received enough and that it is about time
I that Gage held out something for himself. Can it be
possible that his Excellency is* scheming to acquire
a reputation?
A man-eating shark was captured the other day on
the bay shore at West Berkeley. He was cut open
and inside him were found a number of small sharks
he had swallowed. How human!
The students of the State Normal School at San
Jose are again in rebellion. A chair of pugilism might
not unwisely be established there and associated with
that of pedagogy.
The attendants at the Stockton Insane Asylum ob
ject to being uniformed. They should at least take
into consideration that the public have a right to a
cue of some kind after entering the gates-

ment In the premises, which undoubted^
could be obtained at any moment.
It matters little to me what practical
men who want trade might sa> , it mat
ters not much more what Po"Â« cla "?
might say: there is to my mind in this
instance only one course that is rignt
only one course that is manly ana if we
as a people can come to the same con
clusion, it would be inhuman to furtner
prosecute the war. _,v,Â«n
There is nevor a moment of time when
it is too soon to do right, and the t.me
has now arrived (and for some 'irae^ has
existed) when this Government should
seek to end this war by an immeci ate
proposal to grant the Filipinos freedom
and self-government, upon teims so lair
and reasonable that there could be no
question of their immediate acceptance
If these people desire liberty, it Is theirs
of right. We have no right to withhold
it; we have no right first to defeat
destroy and suojugate them and then
rrant "them liberty; but it is theirs now
if they wish it. By purchasing the .wrong
of 300 years we have not acquired the
right to continue that wrong for one
Instant, and whatever others may sa> 1
contend that the question of freedom and
liberty, or of one form of government or
another ,is not to be solved by tho
nation which is seeking to impose its
government upon another. Such a â  aen
nition of liberty would be denying liberty
to all men. Â .
If there is any place in the world where
we have no natural right, no affinities
by birth or by nature, it is" in the Philip
pine Islands. Unless we can purchase
jurisdiction over men and countries trom
a king that had no right to such juris
diction, and thereby acquire good title to
rule over them, we are in the Philippine
Islands attempting to force our republi
can institutions upon the Malay inhabi
tants thereof by the sword with as little
right as any country, ancient or modern,
ever undertook to impose its government
upon any people.
Correctly speaking republics are created
for the government of citizens. It a
Government is to govern subjects, or
subjects in addition to its citizens, it
ought not to be founded upon republican
or democratic lines. Historically speak
ing, republics, where they have taken up
cn themselves the inconsistent power or
privik-ge to rule over subjects, have been
far more despotic, ruthless and unreason
able in their rule than have absolute
monarchies. It can be readily seen that
citizens naturally accord toward each
other good government. But millions of
people, though self-governing, ruling over
others, having no right or participation in
that government, subject them to worse
deputism than the absolute rule of one
man.
If these seventy millions of people un
dertake to rule the Filipinos without
their consent, it is simply a depotism
divided among seventy millions of people.
In other words, seventy millions of free
citizens with relation to themselves,
occupy the relation of being seventy
millions of despots as to others. As an
aggregation of people arbitrarily impos
ing our government upon an unconsenLir.g
people, we are each one of us as much
pursuing and undertaking a despotic
form or government as the Czar of
Russia, when he imposes by military
force his rule upon his subjects.
It wouid seem that we have embarked
upon and undertaken the policy of ex
pansion and subjugation without ade
quate consideration either of the question
of the right or the policy, its expediency
or the suitability of our form of govern
ment to undertake such a course. When
considered in the iight of our previous
deciar.uk ns, when considered in connec
tion with our form of government, it cer
tainly must and ultimately will be con
e-led that the attempt is not only un
just but wholly impracticable and will
result ultimately not only in disaster to
the people upon whom we are attempting
to Impose f>:jr government but even with
greater disaster to ourselves. It is not
our l>:istii':rfs to determine whether the
Filipinos will give themselves a good
government, as a king, an emperor or a
republic. A\ c have no right to determine
that question for them. It is no more our
tnisiness than is the government of
France, of China or of Switzerland.
( >ur flag was once supreme over the
Mexican capital and our military forces
Were in undisputed possession of the prin
cipal stronghold of that country, while
we required the cession to us of certain
territory already largely populated by
American citizens we took our flag down
from every place where it had no right to
float and ' returned the territory to \t>v
Mexican people, together with the capital
and their government, which government
they have since exercised and with which
we have not interfered. So that even In
our past history it has not been our policy
that where the flag once goes up it must
forever etay. Except for military pur
poses the flag should never go up over
any country or any people which we do
not desire ultimately to make into States
and into citizens.
If it were to be asserted that our ob
ject was ultimately to create States in
the Philippine Islands and grant to the
inhabitants thereof citizenship the politi
cal popularity of expansion would cease
In a moment and the policy would be
overturned and destroyed. While the
more consistent it would be a wholly un
popular policy. The other policy of
colonization and subjection is more wrong
in principle and less desirable and profit
able :or the reasons set forth.
If the American people and their Gov
ernment should at once take an open,
manly nml humane po?ition with relation
to the Filipinos and accord them lib
erty we would not only be entitled to re
ceive but would receive the commenda
tion of all people who appreciate justice
and love liberty throughout the earth.

PRESENTATION OF BADGES.
Ivy Chapter of the Eastern Star |
Shows Its Appreciation of Its
Past Patrons.
Almost every member of Ivy Chapter,
Order of the Eastern Star, was in the
chapter room in Golden Gate Hall Monday
night to witness the presentation of
handsome jewels to eight of the past
patrons, and in addition to the member
ship there were present about twenty
five specially invited guests.
In the past it has been the custom to
present to the retiring matron upon the
close of her term of office a fine jewel in
token of approval of the manner in which
she discharges her duty, but the patrons
were allowed to step down and out with
out any token of recognition. Recently
the chapter concluded that in view of
their work and devotion to the order they
each should have some substantial recog
nition and decided to give each a jewel.
The token is the star of the order upon
which rests the emblem of the office and
surrounding it is a wreath of ivy in j
enamel the color of the leaf and this is ;
suspended from a crown and scepter.
The recipients were John Hatfield Gray,
who received the token from Mrs. Abble j
Salisbury, who was matron with him i
during his term of office, and the others '
received theirs from those who served j
with them. J. P. McMurry from Mrs
Annie Lambert; G. "YV. H. Patterson from
Mrs. J. H. Gray; Harry Ascroft from Mrs.
Clara A. Gtberson; C. C. Dow from Mrs
Helen Davis Patterson; Elwood Morey
from Mrs. Jennie A. Graves; C. L. Pat
ton from Mrs. C. C. Dow, and the one
from Frank Maxon, who was absent was
handed to Patron Dr. Gassaway by Miss
Nellie Owens, who was the first matron
of the chapter. The presentation,
speeches and the responses were pleasintr
efforts in that line. The Knickerbocker
Quartet, during the evening, favored with
vocal selections.
After the ceremonies about 200 ladies
and gentlemen adjourned to the bananet
hal , where the worthy matron, Mrs
Lydia A. Steele, and the worthy patron
Dr. Gassaway, presided. After the sup
per had been disposed of 'there were a
number of responses to congratulatory
toasts. â¢/â â â¢.'â â ; ;"â .â ..â .>.; -â â  ..- '

HITE ERASED
The Prosecution Makes
Grave Charges.
THE EVIDENCE DESTROYED
INDIAN WOMAN HAS A BAD DAY
OF IT.
Attorneys for the Defense Spent Al
most the Entire Morning in
Attacking the Character
of Plaintiff.
SpoclÂ«d Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
MAJUPOSA. Sept. 28.â When court
opened for the fourth day of the Bite
divorce case this morning both plaintiff
and defendant ware absent. It was stated
to the court that Hite was sick in San
Francisco and that the dusky plaintiff
was under thÂ» care of Dr. George H. Bur
nott of Mariposa.
. Thosa who have watched the triai
closely have formed an idea that the
plaintiff's staff of city lawyers were keep
ing something carefully In the back
ground. The evidence mostly so far has
been hearsay. Men have testified to hear
ing John Hit a acknowledge Lucy Hlte as
his wife, but there is another part and a
big one that wu to have been decisive.
That was no less than a hotel register
containing the signature, "John R. Hite
and wife." This was said to be in thÂ»Â»
handwriting of the plaintiff.
It now appears that the introduction of
this book Is problematical. Attorney
Charles M. Hanlon brought to Manp >sa
with him some gunny sacks containing
the registers of the El Capitan Hotel of
Merced. On one page, so it is now said.
was the Inscription, "John R. Hite and
wife, Hites Cove. " Nothing was known
of this star pieca of evidence until it be
came known, that the signature of John
R, Hlte and wife had in the night or some
time this morning been erased. The sig
nature was in pencil.
Lucy Hite's attorneys say they will es
tablish the fact that the signature existed
and that the defendant and plaintiff trav
eled as man and wife at the time. Ugly
stories are afloat concerning the erasure,
but no definite charges are made.
Much of the testimony to-day was of the
sort that cannot be reproduced in a news
paper. This afternoon the dofense took its
turn and confined itself .^entirely to at
tacking the character of Lucy Hite.
A number of witnesses were ex
amined by Attorney Foote to show that
the plaintiff in the case was a dissolute
and Immoral woman and not the wife of
John R. Hite.
The morning session was occupied
largely in reading letters addressed to
Tnomas Gibbs by John R. Hite and iden

and a moment later Sheriff Stewart wont
up to Mrs, Broome and spoke a word,
whereupon she arose and, accompani>-'l by
her pastor, followed the officer out of th*_

Fruit and Salmon in England.
Fruits continue in request at very firm rates
In London; says the Grocers* Gazette, especially
pears, supplies of which are short, and some
of the principal canners have, it is stated,
'our.d it necessary to cut their contracts* to the
extent â¦-* Z> per cent. Prices are, it is reported,
higher in California; A quantity of new
season's foods, principally apricots, has arrived
overland. The "demand for salmon continues to
bo good; which Is no doubt attributed to the
continuance of the summer weather, and a
cciiPliieral'le volume of business has been done
both In spot gixids and to arrive at full rates.
In regard to the new season's pack of Fraser
River Ealmon, it is believed that London, as
well as Liverpool, will receive a fair supply;
Trustworthy ad\ices have come to hand that
r-.-a.-f!' River tall tins and 'i-lb flat tins will
be limited in quantity, and lan<e purchases
have, it la stated, been made by wholesale
houses in anticipation of these shortages.
Gold and Stocks.
_
The New York circular of Henry Clews Bays:
"Our Au^uÂ«t exports of merchandise show an
excels over imports upon a sea which. If con
tinued, must ultimately put it in our power to
draw gold from Europe; but the present cours
of exchange, though slowly yielding in that
direction. Ones not bring that movement within
Hitii.;. From such Indications as appear on th'_
surface, it soems quite possible that the trade
balance may net bring us any appreciable
amount of gold until the return of currency
from the intt-rior has restored .1 normal ease in
money at this center. In that case we .-hall
be in less urgent need â );' the metal, ami its
course will be toward the point where there is
the greatest demand for it. Lai experience
luis shown that American balances may rest in
Europe tt. the extent of seventy to eignty mill
lons, v hen the money is r.eedPd mure there
than at home, an.l the comparative rates of
Interest here and abroad will determine
whether we sha! have a repetition of that con
dition during the next fey.- months. It is not
unlikely that, after importing a moderate
amount of specie, we should oe willing to per
mit It to accumulate abroad; and that is the
more probable in prospect of the extraordinary
travel fi-om here next year to the Paris Expo
r ition.

Dried Fruit Looking Up.

OM NEW YORK.
Mail advices from New York say of dried
fruit; "After long waiting dealers In dried
fruits are rewarded with a more active and con-
Blderably stronger market. While there has
been no material advance in spot prices there
is a ... feeling on the coast, which is
manifesting itself in the market for future or
prompt delivery. Prunes are held with m re
confidence. Rulsins only await the announce
incnt of prices on th* new crop to gO into con-
BumpUon very rapidly, and there is a better
re-fling In peaches. Intimations of this eh: :se

EASTERN MARKETS,
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â market for se- !
curities to-day was a small and tame affair by
contrast with the violent fluctuations of the
earlier period of the money stringency. The
rate for call money vibrated between 12 and 14
per cent during the periods of active demand, j
but after that was satisfied well by quick j
stages to 3 per cent. The need of borrowers
over the ensuing holidays was satisfied in
large part in anticipation of pressure for ac- j
commodation to-day, and consequently to-day's I
higher rate did not reach within 6 per cent of ;
yesterday. The bank statement was unfavor- i
able beyond all expressed anticipation. Al
though the outgo to the sub-treasury was re
duced to. $LISC,OCO, four days of business, the
losses of cash to the interior brought the total
reduction in the reserve up to $4,545,800. In j
spite of a net reduction in loans of $7,752,700 the j
nv-ager surplus reserve was still further re
duced $1 23'J ..... It is obvious that loans made
in the last tew days on the Slock Exchange do
not figure largely in this showing, and the ac
commodations were probably secured by dealers
i in money who ha.', supplied themselves time
loans me time ago and who put their sup
plies out again at the profitable ruling rates j
In ice of the loans called by the banks to â 
m*et the October settlement. The showing ot
llip bank statement and the continued tight- j
ness of money were offset by the additional en- j
menu of gold for import and the drop in j
the rate for sterling exchange to very nearly
the regular port rate. The sentiment on the
Stock Exchange was that further relief to the :
muney market from this source is now avail- ;
; able and that a regular movement of gold is
now inaugurated. No pressure of liquidation
was manliest, and present holders of stock
await a more favorable turn of affairs. The :
confidence in further gold imports was em
phasized by the failure -* the H;.nk of Eng- j
land to advance Us official discount rate, not- 1
withstanding the fact that the principal de- |
mand for money in London is now thrown
upon me central Institution by reason of the
I higher prevailing private rate of discount. A
fall In sterling exchange In response to the
former discounts there suggested additional ;
pressure in London for gold from that source
alone. With gold moving to New York, some â¢
measure of protection by the bank at an early
day may be accepted as a certainty. The in
terior money markets in this country gave no
evidence of "a relaxation of the pressure upon
New York for funds. New York exchange at in- :
i terior points tending rather downward. Some
relief Is anticipated next week from dividend
and interest disbursements and from the ;
i money left in the city by the visitors to the
Dewey celebration. Except tor a recovery of
31-, In Tennessee Coal, gains of 'â¢ ; 4 and 2 in the
ISt Louis Southwestern stocks and wide move
ments in a few usually inactive stocks, to
day's market was without notable Incident.
The total dealings fell to the level or the mld
pummer period of dullness. Dealings In bonds
were on a Email scale and price chances were
mixed. Total sales, par value, $1,325,000.
United States new 4s declined 4 in the bid
PI The elimination of two days from the busi
ness week, and the prospect of dullness next
week consequent upon the yacht races, ac
centuated the speculative stagnation which
always follows a period of unusual activity in
the Ftock market nnd limited the transactions
of the last four days. I
The hope is expressed that the dividend and
i Interest disbursement may serve to relive some
what the local pressure upon the money mar
ket. Many wildly varying estimates are beard
also of the effect of expenditures by Dewey day
visitors on the local money supply. But as to '
the main causes of the depletion of banking re- |
serves, it is manifest that the needs of the in
terior for money to move the crops are not yet
1 appeased. Neither Is any cessation of the
I absorption of the money by the treasury in
eihht, as the Government's expenditures are 1
! now running well under receipts. The August
surplus will apparently be doubled in Septem
ber and the July deficit in more than wiped out,
1 leaving a growing surplus as the fiscal year
I progresses. There has been constant demand â 
for all the >;â .! 1 certificates which have been \
available at the New York sub-treasury. But.
as these simply served to convert the gold of
New j.irk banks Into a form more desired by
' the depositors, their distribution has aug- S
mented rates rather than relieved the decline â¢
on New York banks. Many of the clearing
house Institutions started the week with their
reserves under the legal limit and with addi- j
tional demands upon them there has been i
I further calling of loans. The stock market has j
been unprepared to move upward under the !
i circumstances, but It has shown signs of resist- '
Â«>>...â¢ to a decline also which marie the bears I
wary of raiding stocks. It Is evident that I
; stocks are much less vunerable to attack and
that weak speculative holdings on margin and
' with borrowed money have been shaken down
! upon a more solid foundation. Stocks with in
trinsic merit were taken 8* such times by
I powerful interests not dependent upon or
dinary money market reserves. Some of these
provided â  themselves with funds in time to.
answer before the present stringency set In and
have a handsome profit available now by re
i loaning on call. No small part of the current j
transactions in money are or this character and :
j naturally do not affect the showing of thÂ«
i banks at all. There have been several monthly
reports by (rreat ' railway systems during the !
â week, bowing extraordinarily favorable re- j
â¢ sults and reports of -weekly gross earnings :
â  5-how the high level well maintained. The
Transvaal developments caused but Blight in- !
fluence on the local stock market.

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK. Sept. 28.â The Financier says:
The statement of the New York clearing-house
banks. Issued Thursday, September 28, covers
the average operations of the preceding four
days only. The showing Is not favorable, but
prospects Indicate that the current exhibit will
bo the last to convey evidences of the liquida
tion which has been a marked feature of the
situation since the opening ofj June. The main
feature of the statement is the loss of four
and a half millions In cash, mostly in the
form of legals. The knowi; business of the
weok to date did not call "nr a decrease Of
that magnitude. The banks ;met the contrac
tion In large part by decreasing their loans.
The loss in that Item has' been $7.7'j2,7yiJ.
Deposits show a loss of $1.' 7 . 226, 200, which is
rather more than the changes in cash and
deposits called for. but the contraction lessened
reserve requirements by ovi'r three millions
and the remainder, or $1,239,750, came out of
the surplus reserve, bringing the excess cash
in banks down to 11.714. 450. The next state
ment of the banks will not appear until Octo
ber 6, and the ensuing nine or ten days will
probably show improvement*, so far as
the New York banks are concerned. An a
result of the holidays in New York an amount
of money not easy to calculate will come into
tho banks here, and while this Is an uncertain
and temporary factor th?r>' Is no question that
Its effect will be to increase the current sup
plies of each. The gold engaged for import
will not arrive In time to figure in the next
statement, but the imports and the rising na
tional bank circulation figures show at least
the general trend of the situation and what
may be expected In the near future. The de
mands for remittance to the Interior are not
increasing and while Interior banks have doubt
less loaned heavily here it is not expected
that these funds will operate to the disad
vantage of local Institutions once the pressure
is over. At about this season every year re
serves in New York begin to recuperate and
It is only natural to look for the usual recovery
from this time on. T'nless all clems fall, there
fore, It may be set down that the crlti<\i!
point In tho fall money movement has been
weathered. This fines not mean, necessarily,
that money rates will strike an exceptionally
low rate soon.
Bradstreet's Financial Review.
NEW YORK. Sept. 2S .â Bra-Istrepfg to-mor
row will cay: The two days' reces? on account
of the Dewey reception gave a holiday appear
ance to the whole week In the stork market.
Large Interests seemed to be doing nothing ami
the public took no part. The professional room
traders were, therefore. In control and at first
depressed prices with comparative eaf* on the
threatening aspect of the Transvaal situation,
and more especially on the Increased firmness
of our own market. The New York bank state
ment of last Saturday showed, It !s true, an In
crease of $2.610,1.00 In surplus reserve, but the
figure displaying a further loss of $3,500,000
'â nsh and a contraction of $17.500,000 in loans
could only Indlcatae that the banks have been
meeting enormous interior demand for funds
by nailing in loans in the stock market.
The same process was apparent in the state
ment put out on Thursday from the clearing
house for the four days ending then. Shipments
of monoy to the Interior continues tills week,
an<l th>> October disbursements and the holidays
also influenced the Rltuatlon, call money being
scarcer and the demands of the market tem
porarily more iin-ss'ng. As a result we have
hiirt not only a 6 to 10 prr cent money market
this week, but on.- In which, as on Wednes
day, 15 per cent or more wa< paid for very
considerable amounts. This naturally caused
- nâ¢â  further liquidation of speculative ac
counts, though the opportunity for this Is to
a large .i^gree now exhausted, weakly held
stocks being pretty thoroughly shaken out.
Brooklyn Rapid Transit hold Its position as
the active feature. Further conflicting rep irts
as to the control of the company carried the
pri^e up to '.'3'z and from there back to 87%,
with another rise t 1 92%. The stories afloat,
lnc'.iu'.lng, as they do, reforencs to a possible
combination of all traction interests, caused
) ith Manhattan and Metropolitan tr> advance.
American Tobacco was one Of the features. It
declined from 1244 t(l n. r >*t '^ selling, which
was explained by tho declaration In the West
of only the rc-irular I 1 * per cent dividend with
out the expected increase. United States Leather
common has been strong, rising to 15 on the ex
pected appearance of the readjustment plan.
The industrials, however, apart frim s t: â 
signs of manipulative support In the Steel
group, wore neglected, soiling off easily on
moderate pressure and rallying with equal fa
cility.
Bradstrect's on Trade.
NEW YORK. Sept. 28.â Bradstreet's will say:
The notal le feature of the business week is the
-â '] of agricultural products. E>Ul trade
continues go..d, though it is conceded at sev
eral markets that the biggest part of the fall
business has beÂ«>n done und that reorders from
n-w on will cut the largest figure. Weather
conditions, while favorable to cotton harvest-
Ing, are claimed to be hurtful to further growth
because >i the dry weather. Outside specula
tiv( Interest In that staple, sh;<rt covering
partly, it is claimed, on foreign account, and
the exceptional strength of the manufacturing
Industry, the products of which are In active
ad and tending upward, are all reflected
in the rani'i advances for both futures and
spots. Visible supplies, while considerably
larger than In recently preceding years, are
Slightly smaller than they were in 1895, since
when consumption has unquestionably heavily
increased. Middling uplands are now %c
higher than at the beginning- Of the month.,
l'se hither than last year, and 2c above the
lowest point reached on tho 1898-99 crop. The
extension of tho price agreement as regards
print cloths, the new one, however, covering
: '!:â â  Prodi!.-'., has strengthened the
situation In cotton (.''-Ms and at tho same time
is credited with presenting an obstacle to ti.e
progress to the proposed combination talked of
for some t!:ne i>ast.
Wheat has remained stea-dily strong, growing
firmer toward tho. close on enlarged foreign
buying and uncertainty as to the outcome of
South African affairs. Sympathetic strength Is
displayed l>y corn and other cereals. Increased
foreign demand is reported largely responsible
too for the stronger tone and advances shown
in hog products. Wool has continued strong:
and in active demand both at home and abroad.
Some American buying is reported nt the Lon
don sales, which will close earlier than ex
pected, owing to .-xhaustion of supplies. In the
manufacturing branch of the trade the demand
Is reported active.
There, is a quieter tone at most of the mar
k.i.-- for steel, and larre buyers have been,
most of them, out of tho market. There is no
diminution In strength, however, and a num
ber of advances, notably on Southern iron and
steel billets, are reported. Complaints of back
ward deliveries are as numerous as ever. Lum
ber remains active at most markets, though
complaints of slow delivery, due to lack of cars,
are nlso heard.
Southern manufacturers have advanced the
price ol Stoves, which are nearly a third higher
tliHii a year ago, and plow manufacturers have
also Joined in this movement, making the third
advance within a year in this branch of farm
implements.
An equally strong; tendency as to price 1b
noted In hardware, particularly builders'
grades.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Sept. 28.â Liverpool played a
prominent part in Influencing the early tone of
wheat trading. That market opened lower, but
quickly recovered, and at the opening here
showed good advances. This was regarded as
Indicating the seriousness of the Transvaal
situation. Early indications also pointed to
large clearances for the day. Outside buying
was quite heavy at the opening, New York
houses being especially prominent. The open
ing in December was at 73%@73%c, an advance
of hi<B%c over yesterday's close. This was at
call price and for a time the market met heavy
selling against these privileges. A good deal
of general profit taking was also done and a
decline In December to 73% c took place, but be
fore 11 o'clock the market had again become
strong with heavy and general buying. The
continual falling off In receipts at prominent
receiving points attracted more attention, and
the belief was more general that the winter
wheat supplies from now on would be much
lighter. New York and St. Louis at the same
time reported numerous acceptances of yester
day's cabled offers. Best prices were obtained
In the last hour of trading. The market during
that time exhibited a good deal of nervousness
and the price changed rapidly, though within
a narrow range. Realizing was heavy, but on
all slight breaks the market received substan
tial support, and though best prices -were not
maintained, the close was at a substantial ad
vance. A good improvement in the demand for
flour was reported and this had an influence on
speculative trading. The market at the close
showed a marked growth of bull sentiment
â among local traders, and trading throughout
showed the effects of Increased outside Interest.
A bull feature was the falling oft of 800,000
bushels In primary receipts in the past four
days. December advanced to 74VÂ»c and reacted
to 73% C where it closed. Considerable trading
was done in May, and that future developed
more strength than anything else on the floor.
It closed 3*c higher at 73% c.
I Corn was fairly active and Irregular. There
I was heavy liquidation of September by the in
terests supposed to be most prominent on the
; long side and this influenced the market all
day. Deferred futures, in which trading was
mostly of a scalping nature, were veak for a
I time In .sympathy, but later recovered on cover-
I ing by shorts and closed steady. December
closed Vie higher at 304 c. September closed y*c
lower at 32% c.
Oats reflected the action of com, September
1 bring weak on moderate liquidation In spite of
â  small receipts, v.-hile deferred futures were
steady. Trading was small and mostly of a
Bcal] nature. The cash demand was rather
slow. December cl<vÂ«ed a shade higher at 22"*
@23c; September Closed V c lower at 22% c.
Provisions were firm and in good demand. The
chief influence was the heavy cash demand and
fair advances were scored (luring the morning
on buying by local operators and exporters.
Later heavy selling by packers caused a re
â  action, but the market closed steady at plight
changes. January pork closed 2Vic lower at
$9 80. January lard unchanged at $5 62' 2 and
January ribs a shade lower at $5 12%.

The situation is rapidly improving in thÂ«
East as will be seen in the first column. The
New' York Journal of Commerce says that It
Is reported that for some time past there has
been an active export business In Prunes, but
the facts have been kept below the surface.
The movement has been large, however, and
some estimates place it at 1000 cars, of which
IS) cars were sold last week. This business has
been on a 3c basis. . ,
The demand for all fruits is steady on this
market and full figures are generally obtained.
Large Prunes are meeting with more inquiry.

GET THE NEEDED
ROOM TOON
Important Conference
to That End.
. The prospects cf PoatoJOce Station D
rave brightened materially during the
ras; for:;.- -eight hours. Yesterday after
noon Karfcor Commissioner Kilbvirn, pres
ident of the board, annconced to a re
porter of The Call that an understand
ing has been reached, by reason of which
Station D will get all the rccm that is
needed for the prompt and satisfactory
transaction of business. Mr. Kliburn said
tha: he vras authorized to speak for his
associates. But Mr. KHbura would not
give any- particulars, because, he said,
that would be a breach of courtesy to
the parties interested. Beyond the state
ment that the conclusion will be satisfac
tory to all tne parties, which Mr. Kilburn
added to his original statemen:, he would
not gc. Mr. Kilburn also assumed that
nothing further will be given out at once,
which assumption was warranted by an
unavailing attempt to learn all tee facts
"VVecnesday afternoon. Messrs. Munro
ar.d Ersv'.n ci the postal service conferred
with Commissioner Kilburc. The Incon
veniences attending the present allotment
of space about the ferry were all gone
Into at length. The trouble, it was clear
ly set forth, was caused fcv the crc^sir?
oi the Wells-Fargo and other teams over
space on taelwhart occupied by the postal
People; also fay the fact that the poat
ofl *Â« station is on two Soors instead of
â¢-â r.e. Messrs. Munro and Erwfn made it
C '\t- M!rÂ£ the r V? rter wa / argent
Mr. Munro said yesterday that he was
Surprised when he saw the 'facts concern
ing _t..e postal matter printed in yester
aay s Call; because th* matter had been
kept very quiet. K Â« w Â± 3 of t -_ e o-,.^^
after talk:.-.? with Mr. Kilburn that the
postal station will get all the space ar.d
accommodation that is necessary from the
Harbor Commissioner?. "We "found Mr
Kilbnrn wiping to do all that he can and
>"c were impressed with the idea that the
present board sees the necessities of the '
case. I think that the matter wlii soon
oe adjusted sarisfaotorily."
There are only two ways to give thÂ»
postal station more room. One way iÂ« to
move the express company, and the* oth*
:s to move :he PostoCce Station -f>*
Neither wishes to move, but that one or
the other will move is certain. If Sta
tion D had the 'â¢dolphin" In the rear ex
clusively there would be room enough for
its use for many years, and the additional
advantage would be enjoyed of freedom
from interruption. If Station D is moved
to any other part of the ferry building
the postal business would stlll.be subj-ct
to the Interruption of passins vehicles.
<jn the "dolphin" is room enough for the
Tracing qt additional buildings to accom
modate Station D all on one floor, which '
is much to be desired.'

DAY OF SHARP
ARGUMENTS ON
CHARTER CASE
â¦
The Supreme Court
Hears Attorneys.
â
The Supreme Court, sitting? In bank,
Chief Justice Eeatty presiding-. listened to
the arsrumects In the charter case yester- !
ia.y morning and afternoon. E. S. Pi!"s- j
sury opened the forensic er.g-a?emen.t, and i
eras foHowed by Frar.klin K. Lane, who ]
rave way to Garre; McEnerney." Thomaa
V. Cator closed, and the court took the
:ase under advisement.
It is the old case of M. F. Frag-ley vs.
lames D. Pheian et al., fcegrun originally |
:o enjoin the holding- cf the election this ;
fail. Fragiey is represented by A. Ruef, <
rhoaaas V. Cator and E. S. PiUstury. and |
Fohn Garb-er of counsel. The city officials j
*"ho comprise the Board cf Election Corn- \
nissioners had their cause championed by !
Jarret McEr.erney, Henry X. Clement !
-.nd Franklin X- Lane. The courtroom 'â 
vas crowded during the entire day by at- :
:omeys, who listened with grtat a.tten
lon to the arjurnent.-? on b-^th sides.
Ptiiibury's argument was confined to the I
-gal aspect of the question. He contend- '
id that the act of 1:.5, which refers spe- â¢
â iricaily to precinct registration sjad pre- !
â¢Inct election, was violated in spirit and
etter
"Every voter of San Francisco had a '
â igb.l, material and mandatory,' to vote;
a any intermediate eitrction In the saaÂ« :
reeints as ne would have vot*d at the j
text preceding general election." was the â 
:txt of Mr. Piilabary'a argument. He I
licieO tha.t the action ot tne Board of
Election Commissioners in consolidating
333 precints of the city into nlnety
'â <â -? destroyed the territorial boundaries
it '-'::- -recinctsand deprived the people oi (
rested rights ilr. Pulsbury's deductions j
from tkesÂ« premises were that the act of j
March, ; 1.7, which wa-s "or the ors-acita- Â»
:iozi of a new form of municipal govern-;
scent for S A n Franoisco, was therefore
Inoperative for every purpose, ar.d that!
:he election wa3 carried on in violation of â 
Lh-e rights al electors as to place.
Franklin X Lane followed and replied i
:o the arsament of Mr. Pillsbury. He j
said in part:

A LARGE MINING DEAL
The Cherokee Property to Be Bought
by a Pittsburg Syndicate.
W. P. Lynch, formerly the Assessor of i
Butte County. Is at the Lick for the pur- '
pose cf seeing various interested parties i
In this city and winding up a great mining j
deal which will result in the famous
Cherokee mine, which is situated five i
miles from Orovi'.l-e, near the north fork
of the Feather River, changing owners j
and becoming the property cf a --burg i
syndicate.
The Cherokee mir.e is so well known to j
the people of this State that it is not r.ec- j
essary to repeat its history- Suffice to !
say that It was first operated In the i
sixties, and from then up to the time it i
was tied up in litigation, some thirteen or i
fourteen years ago-, it produced over $14.- ;
OOOjOOO of the precious metal. It Is a hy- ;
draulic mine and one of the richest in the
entire State.
The property new stands in the name of .-
T. Z. Blakeman. who was the attorney j
for the bondholders, and who, after thir- j
teen years of almost continuous litigation, j
won for them their suit asrainst the Bank
of California. The Pitts burg syndicate |
is represented by Dr. I. B, Hamilton of ;
that city, and Sir. Lynch Is associa-ted !
with him, acting at this end of the line ;
in securing an option on the stock held i
by local investors.
The property is principally owr.ed in the j
East, as out cf the 140 shares of the cap- j
tt&l stock only twenty-four are held in '
California. What the price will fee is a J
secret, but some idea can be obtained j
from the fact that at a sale held some
time a^o the 140 shares, of a per value of

Troubles of a Spartan
Author in Court.
â¦
OAKLAND, Sept. :â¢ â "â¢ â  many
wees of Constantine Dematrak. a
Spartan, who is suing F. W. Mar
cjuand and W. E. Sells of Berkeley
for JGOOO damages on an alleged
breach of contract in failing to print
3CCO copies cf his book entitled "An Un
fortunate Merchant" according to certain
specifications, are multiplying. The trial
has occupied the attention of Superior
Judge Ogden â¢---.-â â¢ days, Major
JlcElrath appearing for the plaintiff and
Attorneys Wltworth and Start! B for
lefendants, and just in the midst of ren
iering his decision this afternoon, one
way or the other, Dematrak's attorney
ieclared that he had suddenly discovered
;hat defendants had in reality printed the
unaccepted books and distributed them
belter skelter. Judge Ogden, gracefully
iccotmnodating the plaintiff withheld
judgment and allowed him until next
Fucstiay to file a supplemental complaint.
On the witness stand Dematrak testified
:hat In Sparta, Greece, he had been
mown as an author of some repute. At
:he tender age of 14 he edited a High
School paper there, and later he was
?ditor cf a bright little sheet entitled
5y Onos. which means, '"you are a
ienkey." The sheet was a satire di
rected against certain oScials in the
joyernment, and Dematrak tcld, after
adjournment to-day, that its birth was
:onceived in I -wager by the terms of
which he declared he would dare to
sreak the solemn law which precluded
â¢Ã¼bjects from applying unseemly epithets
:o King George of Greece. "I published
:his Sy Onos," said Dematrak to-day,
"and then took several copies ...
â Cfng asking, in Greek of course,
vhether he sired to buy a copy of "i'ou
ure a Donkey.' Of course I won the bet.'"
Dematrak. testifying, declared that he
3ad contracted to sell S5Â«Â» copies of his
>ock, "An fortunate Merchant," at 50
rents each, and that he could have sold
.he entire edition at that figure. He had
lisa secured many advertisers, but owing
.0 the alleged breach of contract on the
:art of his publishers, he had been un
ible to receive the revenue from the pro
luct of his brain. He exhibited letters
ihcwing that orders for his book had
:orne from Chicago. New York, Sparta.
Greece. Constantinople, Alexandria,
ar.d towns in this State.
Several copies of the book as printed

since the show opened there have been
thousands of guests under the acres of
canvas. Yesterday was orphans' day,
and between 2000 and 3000 little folks
thronged the tents during the afternoon.
feasting their wondering eyes on the be
wildering panorama of flying figures ar.J
strange animals. All the seats on one
side of the big main tent were reserve-!
for them, and the management was very
solicitous for their enjoyment. They not
only saw the menagerie and circus but
remained for the minstrel performance,
and then were. taken to the smaller tents
and treated to a r#ep at the sideshow.
It Is no wonder that the children think
Waiter L. Main ts "the greatest showman
that ever lived," for such liberality and
thoughtfulness was never before heard
of here.
To-day more orphans will be enter
tained as the guests of the circus people.
But the orphans were not the only ones
at the circus yesterday afternoon, for the
tents were crowded. The same condition
prevailed last night, but In a larger de
gree, for there were not enough seats to
go around, and standing room was at a
premium. The circus will close Sunday
night. but in the three days remaining
the tents are sure to be crowded.
FRENNA STAYS IN JAIL.
J. P. Frenna. murderer of James F.
Turner. . must remain in jail for his of
fense. After Frenna shot Turner down In
the Crocker building he was* taken before
Police Judge Graham for preliminary ex
amination, and although It was found that
Frenna . was \ guilty of murder an order
was made for his release on bail, the sum
being fixed at $5000. A writ of rertiorari
for the review of the proceedings of the!
lower court was argued before Judge i
Lawlor. but it Â«m held that, as the
"forms cf i procedure" had been followed
by Judge Graham they could not be re
viewed, notwithstanding the danger lurk-
Ing in the establishment of a. precedent

WISHES HE HAD
ALL THE WISDOM
OF A SOLOMON
Young Girls Before
Judge Smith.
â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
SOS Broadway. Sept. .
--â =-â¢.- of the Police Court wished
this morning that he were a Solomon. He
had before him three young women whose
cases caused him much thought. All were
depraved ar.d all were. under 20.
The girls were Annie McHenry,Llly Don
nelly and Florence Marquardson. Prose
cuting Attorney Leach was at a loss how to
advise the court as to the disposition he
would like to have made of the cases. The
McHenry girl is not a new figure in the
Police Court. It is believed that she is
not endowed with her full share of com
mon sense and that her waywardness Is
more want of will than want of heart.
The Judge suggested that it might be ad
visable to send Annie to the Ben Home,
but he reasoned that the influences there
could hardly be expected to strengthen a
girl's mind, so he took her case under ad
visement.
It was not difficult to size up Miss Lily
Donnelly. The young lady marched be
fore the Judge in a manner common to
girls who walk on â¢ .--- In dives. With
three fingers she poked ud the brim of her
gay little hat so that she couid get a full
look at his Honor. The Judge asked her a
few questions, to which she replied that
she knew^she was bad and that she fully
understood the penalty of being convicted
for vagrancy. lily does not look to bs
over 15. and Is not IS. Judge Smith tcld
her that she was at an age when she
could ----- a reform school, to which
she very quickly replied: "If that is the
best you can do I can't help it." Her
case was taken under advisement.
Florence Marquardson is an attractive
girl from San Francisco, and according to
her story and the inquiries made by the
police It is thought that if her home influ
ences had been somewhat different the
girl might never have been In a Police
Court dock. Florence was arrested far
â¢â ---â¢.- but her looks and manner do
not indicate that she Is past reform, or
even <i long way down the slid* of degra
dation. The Judge talked with her a few
minutes and took her case also under ad
visement.
'â These are the cases," said Judge smith.
"which gave us more anxiety than those o:
positive criminals. These girls surely do
not prefer to go to Jail or to a reforma
tory rather than behave themselves.
With one exception they don't look
bad. and I don't believe that they desire
to b*Â» bad. Now what can we do? Our
province is very limited, and It doe? seem
to me that there should/ be some method
of dealing with such cases outside the Po
lice Court. Just at this time I wish I were
Solomon, that I might know what is b*Â»:
for ail concerned. This entails more re
sponsibility than trying a. score of hard
ened criminals."

OAKLAND. Sept. 2S.â Miss Annie J.
Garlick delivered an interesting address
to-night before a meeting of the Seventh

her experiences as a Red Crt>.Â«s nurse in
the ' Philippines. Miss Garlick went
through the campaign with the First

admitting a murderer to bail on a bond
scarcely larger than .-â --.-.
of burglars. An information charging
Frenna with murder was riled in the Su
perior Court, however, a bench warrant
was issued by Judse Dalngerfield and
Frenna remained behind the bars.
The action of Judge Graham in the case
caused rumors of a "pull" in Frenna's
favor, and an open raptor between the
District Attorney and special counsel.
The case was assigned to Judge Cook,
and again a motfon to lease Turner's mur
derer on bail was made. The motion was
argued before Judge Cook on several
dates, and yesterday morning the motion
was submitted for decision. Judge Cook
said that the evidence showed that Tur
ner had been shot in the back by his
slayer, that tfcere was bo defense, and
consequently the motion to release on bail
must be denied. Frenna was remanded
to the custody of the Sheriff and returned
to his cell in the County Jail to await
trial.
Y. L. I. ENTERTAINMENT
A GREAT SUCCESS
LARGE AUDIENCE HEARS AS
EXCELLENT PEOGRA2I3IE.
The literary and musical entertainment
given last night at Metropolitan Temple
by the ladles of the Toun? Ladies' Insti
tute was the most successful affair the
association has ever furnished the music
lovers of San Francisco. The auditorium
was crow. long before the evenicg^s
programme was begun, and when it wai
over every one went away pleased.
There was a sprinkling of the profes
sional in th*Â» amateur prosrramme. John
Morrisey of the Orpheum kindly loaned
two of the star attractions of the superb
bill he is running this week and they got
a royal reception. Dainty Uttie Cecil
Cowles won. the audience with her mar
velous performance on the piano and her
charming voice. Notwithstanding tÂ£at
the child has had never a lesson in music
she Is a wonder to the extent that the
Orpheum. people have long besought her
parents to permit her to accept an en
gagement. The programme was extremely
well selected 1 throughout, as the following

As the matter now stands nothing can.
be done till Octottr l& Next ilonday,
October 2, the Council will paas the ordi
nance appropriating- moss; and author
izing- th.e> lioartl oÂ£ Worka to test the capa
city of the welis. This ordinance muse be
printed ten civ.-? and cannot Le finally
passed until October 15. The Board of
Works, if it meets the following day. wiu
have to prepare speefneatiens, advertise
tor ijtdd Â«.nd awira the contract with re
markable speed iJ the work can ever bezin
on the day tne option expires.
â¢These wells wstl no doubt be good for
a starter." said President Rowe of the;
Council, who visited tne property last
Sunday. "As soon as the city acquires a
supply of water, even U it be not suffi
cient to supply the whole city, we create
a competition, and with the city on one
end it will r.ot be like the competition
through which we have recently passed.
I do not see why we cannot have a com
plete system independent of existing sys
tems. If we attempt condemnation pro
ceedings â we shall have an endless task.
There is certainly good water down there.
This is proved by Mr. Dingee, and he
found enough water to supply this city. I
believe, judging by the contour of the
land, that the wells on whicn we have an
option are better located than the Alva
rado wellsâ that Is to say they are
nearer the source of the artesian supply.
"If we get this water to Oakland and
commence to supply it and need more
water we can surely do the same as the
Contra Costa Company has done â that is.
arrange far a catchment system. I have
no doubt there Is plenty of. land back of
Sar. Leandro that could be obtained for
the construction of a lake similar to Lak^
Chabot. I have been asked several
times what would be done with the old
plant if the city acquires one. and I can
not say that I care much. The old com
pany has got all it can out of the city for
more than a generation, and when we
don't want its plant it is at liberty to sell
It to the Spring Valley Company cr any
other concern that want? it."
"â  Is possible that Captain Roberts may
extend the time of the option.

DELEGATES to the Republican
nominating convention who were
chosen at the recent primary elec
tion, under the auspices of the Cen
tral Republican League, caucused at
15'nal H'rith Hall last night. The session
vas animated but not disorderly. The
caucus furnished one surprise for the
politicians. I. J. Truman was turned
â¢down for Treasurer, and Louis Feusler
of the firm of Martin, Feusier & Co., com
mission merchants, nominated. It was
yhlsjiered in several of the delegations
that Mr. Truman was too close to the
bosses to merit the confidence of the con
vention. The caucus nominee. Mr.
FeuFler, is well known in commercial
circles of this city. He has been actively
engaged in business hero for thirty-five
"years.
.Delegates to the caucus assembled
"leisurely at the hall. Many of them
loitered outside on Eddy street to listen
to the pursuaJsive music of the candidates
â¢â until after the hour appointed for pro
ceedings to begin.
â  A hoi fight seemed imminent when
Delegate Hillman moved for the ad
â¢ mission of nine delegates of the Thirty
t-Ighth District, who had pledged al
. legiance to the principles of the Central
Republican League, and promised to
abide by the will of the caucus. Resist
"ance was offered to the motion on the
, ground that such admission would open
' the d.or henceforth to boss delegates.
'the new converts were admitted, how
, ever, and hailed with applause. The
i resolution admitted only nine, but the

skirmish took place when the methods of

ascertaining tlie merits of supervisorial
candidates came up for discussion. The
debate discli - I the fact that the talkers
are legion. The result of all the talk was
the authorization of a committee to in
vestigate the record of ci adldates.
The names ut tn< following proposed
candidates for Supervisors were presented
to the caucus:
M. S. JefrVrs. J. P. L*> Count. William

or' the proposed candidates:

L. Nolan; Thirty-fourth. J. K. C. Hobbs;

The committee will meet at the Grand

chants who are widely known and whose
names are not embraced In the foregoing
list will be presented to the committee to
day. â 'â â â  â .â¢â â¢
The selection of a candidate for Mayor
will not be made until the convention as
sembles. The acceptance of the nomina
tion by Horace Davis is no longer doubt
ed. The Indications are that John Lack
mann will be nominated by the caucus
to-night for Sheriff. Albert Heyer Is
likely to receive the Indorsement for As
sessor. Dr. Perrault is strongly advocated
for Public Administrator and his success
Is predicted. W. A- Deane, it Is said, will |
gel the caucus indorsement for County
Clerk. A. P. Black seems to be leading
for District Attorney.
Chairman Sheldon <';. Kellogg called the
caucus to order. John K. Hillman of the
Thirty-fifth District then arose and stated
that In the Thirty-eighth District there
were nine delegates who had signified
their intention of joining the movement
and had appeared before the Central or
ganization since the election and were j
desirous of entering the caucus, and if I
admitted they were willing to pledge!
themselves to abide by the decision of
the caucus. He therefore moved that H.
D. As. her. D. B. Faktor, Max Goldberg
A. G. Hagcxlorn, G. Pohlman, Frank
Rpbb I. Schwartz. George Tantau and F.
\\ . Thompson be admitted.
The motion met strong opposition from i
Chairman Bradford of the Forty-first Din-'
trict, who stated that it was establishing i
a precedent that would be followed by
himself the following night, as he had two
delegations who were also anxious to join '
the caucus. Delegate Sargent Joined him
in his struggle to have them kept out In
the cold. The matter brought on an in
finite amount of talk, and In the end the
delegation was invited in. It was then
discovered by Chairman Kellogg that
there were eleven men in the delegation I
and this was easily explained by the
mover of the motion. A series of mo
tions, amendments, points of order and
points of information followed in quick
succession, and had to be disposed of be
fore the delegates could swear allegiance
to the caucus. This having been con
cluded, Smith renewed his offer of a reso
lution, which passed through a perfect
avalanche of discussion before it was ac
cepted by those present. it was to the
effect that a committee, consisting of one
delegate from each district,, be appointed
by the chairman to agree on an order of
business. The matter having at last been
settled, the chairman appointed Louis
Freltsch, B. L. Nolan, Ralph L. Hathorn
F. W. Warren. Charles G. Nagle, Benja
min A. Curtaz, R. Mitchell, D. L. Farns

M. A., an eminent literary and
dramatic critic of Boston, will ar-
rive in this city on October 10,

from his own transcript version.
Miss Jenne M. Long, a reader who
has won praise from eminent critics.
and who Is now in charge of the
School of Oratory of the Pacific
Coast Conservatory of Music, will as
sist him.
Mr. Ticknor was born In Boston. â 
He is a son of William D. Tlcknor.H
under of the publishing house. nndH
cousin of George Ticknor, historian ofH
Spanish literature. On graduatingH
from Harvard, In- entered the Ipumm.tsM
of Ticknor cV Fields, and soon bocaineÃ
assistant editor of the Atlantic. withM
James Russell Lowell as chief. AfterÃ
spending a year In London on imt-ln.'.ssÃ
for the firm lie returned to thisH
country and edited Our Young: Folks.
On retiring- from business Mr. TieknorÃ
went abroad and remained there forH
ten years, chiefly In Italy, where he de-H
voted much time to study and to con-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^|
sular service. Immediately on his return to the United States he was ap
pointed instructor of elocution at Harvard, and subsequently was a member
of the Brown faculty for several years. He now devotes himself to private
teaching and special writing. He has always been engaged in the critical
departments of journalism, having held editorial staff appointments on the
Boston Advertiser, Globe and Courier. Mr. Ticknor also corresponded from
Italy for the London Graphic and represented the New York Times at the
opening of the Suez canal.
Within the last three years he hap begun the de-livery of his "L,ecture-
Readings," the novelty and the interest of which established them at once
In the favor of both literary and fashionable audiences, untying as tli<>- do
the arts of the essayist and the reader. One of the first subjects illustrated
waa Tennyson's ".Maud." prepared for the exclusive Saturday Morning club
of Boston, and since followed by other themes, to which many of the most
distinguished audiences of the East have listened with approval. Last winter
the great Institute of Arts and Sciences of Brooklyn engaged a course of
five, which were received with such enthusiasm that Immediately upon their
conclusion an invitation waa extended for a series of six, to be given during
the next season.

bard, chairman of the committee, read a I
report in which the committee respect
fully recommended that the order of busi
ness be as follows; that thÂ« nomination of
Mayor be laid over for the convention to
deliberate on, and that the presentation
of names of candidates for the following
offlci b be received and acted upon in the
following order: Supervisors, Auditor,
Treasurer, Assessor, Tax Collector. Re
corder, City Attorney, District Attorney,
Public Administrator, County Clerk,
Sheriff. Coroner, four Police Judges; that
nominating speeches be limited to live
minutes and that $10 be assessed to each
candidate;
The report was adopted.
Delegate Smith was of the opinion that
the nomination of Supervisors should be
1 left until the Mayor had been nominated.
This brought on more discussion and In
the â  nd ii was explained to the satis
| faction of all the delegates that no Su
: pervisors were to be selected that even
: ing, but simply the names of prospective
candidates for the office.
Mr. Bradford then moved that the
names submitted be referred to a com
mittee of twelve, to consist of one dele
â  gate from each district. Although the
motion was seconded, it was lost for the
moment in the calling of additional names;
and the general contusion.
During a lull in the proceedings thÂ«Â»
chairman took occasion to order the sec
retary to read a series of resolutions
which were passed at a mass meeting in
the Twelfth Ward, which were to the ef
fect that as that ward was one of the
I largest in the city and had a tremendous
voting strength, sb: of the eighteen Super
visors chosen come from that ward. Ine
resolution created a deal of laughter ana
was placed on file.
Delegate Elder renewed the motion
made oy Mr. Bradford that a committee
of twelve be appointed to consider the
i names offered fur Supervisor. Delegate
Morehouse of the Thirty-first moved as
an amendment that the names be printed
on tickets, be distributed among the dele
gates and be voted on to-night. The amend
ment brought on a heated debate, in
whichEdmundTauszky.J. K.C. Hobbs, M.
Brandt the mover of the amendment and
others participated, and in the end the
amendment, to have a secret ballot, was
' lost and the first portion of a substitute
motion, to have the names printed, was
C M. Brandt then. moved that each delega- j
tion appoint its own member to serve on
the committee on Supervisors. This was
unanimously agreed on.
The chairman then announced that the
next order of business would be the pre
sentation of candidates for Auditor. Dele
gate Mason placed Asa H. Wells in nom
ination, but neglected to make a nor- ;
inating speech. Mr. Bancroft of the
Forty-first District then offered the name |
of \V G. Doane, a well known merchant
of this city. He eulogized him for his
integrity and honesty and read a petition
signed by well known, business men in
dorsing his nominee. Mr. Hillman sec
onded the nomination of Mr. Doane, and
at the conclusion of his speech the candi
dates were invited to the platform. Mr.
Wells had not been apprised of his right
to be present and did not put in an ap
pearance. Mr. Doane did. however, and
addressed the convention as to his quali
fications.
Chairman Kellogg excused the absence
of Mr. Wells on the ground that he did
not know he would bo invited to appear
before the caucus. Max Goldberg and
Delegate Gibbons also apologized for his
absence. Delegate Harness moved that no
more candidates M Invited to address the
caucus, and his motion prevailed. D. L.
â  Reynolds, fearing that Wells' candidacy
would be injured by his absence, moved
to postpone the voting until th* following
night but the motion was lost. On a vote
being' taken Mr. Wells received 137 and
Mr. Doane 62. Delegate Bradford moved
that the nomination of Mr. Wells be made
unanimous, and after Mr. Hillman had
seconded it. it was carried. A motion to
adjourn was lost, and then the question
of finances was taken up. After some
heated discussion it was decided to tax
each candidate $10 for allowing his name
to be presented to the caucus.
After another motion to adjourn had
been lost nominations for Treasurer were
In order. Charles J. King of the Thirty
ninth District arose and said that he sim
ply desired to say that the gentleman he
wished to put In nomination was Louis
Feusler; that he was worthy to hold such
a high office, having held a similar one
in Nevada with credit to himself; that
he was ii man of honor and deserved to
bo placed on the Republican ticket. E.
A. Denicke in seconding the nomination
said that he was a well-known business
man and that if he was ever put in that
high office his honesty and integrity
I would never bo questioned.
Mr. Hobbs then nominated I. J. Tru
man, the incumbent, and Delegate Jones
I seconded it. A vote was then taken and
1 resulted in Mr. Feusier receiving 109 .and
Mr. Truman 79. Mr. Feusler was then
unanimously chosen as the choice of the
: caucus. An adjournment was taken until
to-night at 8 o'clock In the same hall.

SCHOOL BOARD
SCANDAL UP TO
DIRECTOR GEDGE
Grand Jury Probing
Bribery Charges.
The Grand Jury has begun its Investiga
tion of the School Board scandal. Its
': yesterday afternoon was devoted
to taking the testimony of some of the
most important witnesses against the ac
cused School Directors, Dr. H. E. Gedge
and J. J. ("onion. Involved in tlie affair
which has called for Grand Jury inquisi
tion is the Supplies Committee of the
Hoard of Education, of which the Direct
ors named and William Kemp are the
members. The accusations are that Gedge
stated to reputable citizens that he had
received $2000 for swinging a profitable
school contract In the direction of the
firm paying the money, and that he had
given $M)u of the amount to his colleague, j
t onion, for "standing in" on the deal. I
Kemp's only connection with the scandal j
is the horrible howl he has made for be-:
Ing overlooked in the division of the
spoils and from tlie fact that none of the
flitting twenties found a resting placo in |
his itching and capacious palm.
The testimony given yesterday puts the j
matter "up to" Gedge. Positive asser- j
tlons were made that he had admitted ]
paying $800 to Cordon for iniluencing the'
tatter's vote. While the evidence was not
quite as strong that he had acknowledged i
receiving (2000, the fact of the $BuO end of!
the transaction stares the accused Direct- !
or squarely in the face. He can not get
away from it. It Is "up to him" to ex-!
plain to the Grand Jury where he got that :
|800, for what purpose it was given him l
and why hv passed it over to Conlon. il>
has supplied from his own lips the mate
rial which suggests these queries. There !
can be no squirming or evading the issue: I
Wh.ic did that money come from?
Who paid it to < ledge?
Why was it paid to him?
Why did he turn It over to Conlon?
District Attorney Murphy was in con
sultation with the jury in connection with !
the case for some time before the wit
nesses were called. There was an evident I
determination to probe the scandal to the I
bottom, and from the searching examina
tion of the witnesses there appears to be
a disposition to leave nothing undone that
tends to throw light on the School Board
crookedness.
John I>. Spreckels, proprietor of The
Call, was the first to testify. He said
thai Information of the Gedge affair had
been brought to him by one of the repre
sentatives of his paper. This information
was t.i the effect that Dr. Gedge had
told George Walker that he (Gedge) had
received money for his vote on a school
board contract, and that he had paid $S(X)
of it to Director Conlon for "standing in"
with him. Not wishing to do any one
an Injustice and not desiring to publish
any matter in The Call that was not fully
substantiated. Mr. Spreckels sent for
Walker, who admitted that Gedge had
told him of receiving a certain amount
of money and paying $MH) of it to Conlon.
Walker supplemented his story with the
statement that he had made the same as
sertions to School Director Harry M. Hol
brook. With this information, Mr.
Spreckels testified, he sent for the maji
ager of the paper, told him the story was
correct and instructed him to publish it.
The testimony given by Director Hol
brook corroborated that of Mr. Spreckels.
He hnd a perfect recollection of Mr.
Walker telling him of Gedge's admis
sions.
Grove P. Avers told of a conversation
between himself Walker and Holbrook,
during which Walker remarked that
Gedge was dishonest.
"How do you know that? Why do you
make such an assertion?" asked Ayers.
"Because J have received admissions
from Gedge's own lips," was the startling
reply. Walker then went on to detail the
confessions of Gedge that he had re
ceived i.ribe money and had given $SuO
to (.'onion.
When Walker was called before the
jury he wiggled out of a positive state
ment that (iedge had told him of the $20DO
deal. He denied that Gedge had ever
made such a statement to him, or that
he (Walker) had repeated It to Mr.
Spreckels, Mr. Holbrook and Mr. Ayers.
Walker, however, was frank In admit
ting that Gedge had told him that he
(Gedge) had paid JSOO to Conlon to influ
ence the latter's vote.
Mr. Walker's word is against that of
three reputable citizens as to the $2000
matter, but they all agree on Gedge's
statements concerning the $SOO transac
tion with Conlon.
The Investigation will be continued at
the next session of the Jury.

A Distressing Accident.
The wife of William Schmidt met with
a distressing accident last night in the
yard in the rear of her residence, 556
Hayes street, the result of which will con
fine her to her bed for some time. Her
son was playing around a chicken coop
and the structure fell on him in such a
way that he could not release himself and
he cried loudly for help. While answer
ing her son's call Mrs. Schmidt slipped
and fell in such a position that her leg

SPONOGLE SAYS
THE GOVERNOR
SLANDERED RIM
Agnews Superintend
ent Brings Suit.
Dr. F. M. Spnnogle. latf medical puper
i intendent of the Agnews Insane Asylum,
j is of the opinion that the expression of
| various advi-rse sentiments reflecting on
his character by Henry T. Gage, Gover
nor of California and incidentally chair
man of the Lunacy Commission, have re
| suited in his damage to the extent of $50,
--000. On August 20 last a joint meeting of
! the Lunacy Commission and the Board of
' Managers "of the Agnews Asylum met In
! the Palace Hotel for the purpose of ln
-1 vt-stigating charges of misconduct pre
ferred against Dr. Sponogle. At the con
! elusion of the hearing Governor Gage not
' only concluded that Sponogle was guilty
1 of all offenses attributed to him but in his
i report he penned his opinion that the phy
! slcinn was a murderer, ravisher and
swindler, setting forth various circum
. stances in support of his contentions, isow
i i)r Sponogle is of the opinion that ttv ac
i tion of Governor Gage in thus excoriating
him was tho result of wanton mallctous
i neBS and alleges that his assertions,
. charges and reports were all based on
! falsehood and ure ÃbelOUS to a degree.
Dr Sponogle yesterday tiled suit through
his attorneys, H. V. Morehouse and Henry
E Highton, to recover (60,000 from the
i Governor for his circulation of the libels
i alleged and for costs of suit. Dr. Spono
i gle has also sued an evening paper for
i hiving published the report under the
! headline, printed from three-quarter inch
type "Sponogle a Murderer, Bavtoher and
Swindler." For the publication of this
headline Dr. Spnnoglo demands $20,000
damages, and although he has lost his po
sition he Intends to make those who re
moved him defend themselves for their
action.
ENCOURAGING KINDNESS.
Mrs. Hearst Gives Liberally to Bands
of Mercy Work.
The ladles of the Society fnr the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals are hard
at work preparing for the entertainment
to be held in November for the purpose
of raising money to purchase badges for
the youthful memhers of the Bands of
Mercy of the society. More talent of a
superior order thnji can be used has been
volunteered. A number of the ladies are
actively selling tickets and the returns
are cofninj? in satisfactorily. As a sam
ple of the manner in which the public
regards the humane work is a letter re
ceived yesterday by Mrs. Holbrook, presi
dent of the ladies contingent of the or
ganization:
PLEAKANTON, Cal., Sept. 25, 1R99.
Dear MnÂ». Holbrook: I heartily Indorse th>Â»
humane work which the society seeks to do
among the young people attending the public
schools of the city. The impressionable age
of childhood is certainly the best time In whlrh
to Instill lessons of forbearance, of consideration
and of mercy toward our helpless dumb ani
mals. I am happy to extend my work for
the sake of aiding this good cauee. Inclosed
please find a check for $I<X). I hope the pro
jected entertainment will prove a great suc
cess but if it should not be successful from
a financial point of view let me know and I
will add $50 to my donation. With best wishes
for the success of all your good work, believe
mÂ«, very sincerely youre,
I'HKBE A. HRARST.
BAD MAN FROM TEXAS.
William J. Hill, a Soldier, Takes
Forcible Possession of a Private
Boarding-House.
William J. Hill, alias William J. Young,
of Company C, Thirty-third Infantry, ap
peared in Judge Mogan's court yesterday
to answer a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon preferred against him by
Mrs. Ann Lane, wife of W. W. I,ane, pro
prietor of a private boarding-house at 50C
Davis street.
Wednesday Hill and another drunken
soldier went into the Lane boarding
house, and Hill asked Mrs. Lane for some
lif|uÂ»Â»r. She replied that they did not sell
liquor. Hill insisted. a,iÂ« seizing hold of
a chair said with an oath:
"If you don't give me liquor I will kill
youâ and you won't be the first woman
1 have killed, either. I'm from Texas, and
I'm a bad man."
Mrs. Lane became thoroughly frightened
and ran. Hill chased her. and struck at
her three times with the chair, but for
tunately missed her. Lane, hearing the
noise, made his appearance and asked
Hill to control himself. Hill chased him
also with the chair and was left in pos
session of the field, his drunken comrade
having fallen asleep on a chair. Lane
blew a police whistle, and Policemen Mc-
Glynn and Donahue responded. Hill re
sisted arrest, and it took two officers and
two citizens to drag him into the patrol
wagon and take him to the police station
It came out In evidence that Hill had
Hales.
visited other places and threatened to
kill everybody in them unless he was
supplied with liquor. The only explana
tion he gave the Judge was that he was
too drunk to know what he was doing.
The Judge ordered a subpena to be is
sued for Captain Shields, In command of
Hill's company, to appear in the court to
day. The charge was reduced to simple
assault, as no blow had been struck, but
the Judge Intimated that Hill would get
the full limit and would not be able to
accompany his regiment to Manila.
"Mr. Lane." said the Judge, "would
have been perfectly justified in shooting
you, as you had no right to force your
way into' his house and attempt to beat
his wife's brains out with a chair. You
may do these things In Texas, but you
can't do them here."
NOW ORGANIZED FOR A
GIGANTIC ENTERPRISE
GREAT PLAN TO STORE FLOOD
WATERS OF CALIFORNIA.
The gigantic movement which has as
its object the storage of the flood waters
of the State is now thoroughly organized,
and no delay will be permitted to Inter
rupt the progress of the enterprise, which
means so much to the prosperity of Cali
fornia. The men who represent various
and Important interests in this city met
last night to complete organization and
to discuss a call and plan for a convention
which will Include the vital interests of
California. AVilliam Thomas presided,
and Cary Friedlander acted as secretary.
It was unanimously decided that the name
of the organization shall be the California
State Association for the Storage of Flood
Waters.
A sub-committee submitted a re Â£ ort
outlining a call for a convention. This
â¢ all provoked a long discussion and a
final conclusion on the part of the associ
ation to send the report back to the com
mittee for reconsideration. The general
opinion seemed to be that the call should
make little more than an announcement
of a convention to be held in this city, and
that with It but independent of it should
ho Issued an address outlining some of the
suggested plans of the proposed conven
tion and emphasizing the tremendous
value to the State of the storage of flood
waters. W. H. Mills, Dr. Thomas Addison
and F. Barker were appointed a commit
tee on address, and will meet in conjunc
tion with the committee on call next
Wednesday.
Mr. Thomas announced that the Gov
ernor had ignored his letter asking for
co-operation, tiut he added mat he would
try to reach the chief executive in an
other way. Perhaps he had a club In
mind. The association will meet next
Thusrday night.
MATRON'S POST IS
DECLARED VACANT
FRENCH HOSPITAL DISMISSES
ITS HEAD NURSE.
Because thÂ£ French Hospital executive
committee consider that Mrs. Kinney, the
head nurse at the hospital, falls short
as a disciplinarian and lacks discretion,
her post at the hospital was declared va
cant at the committee meeting on Wed
nesday evening.
For some months the committee has
been considering the removal of Mrs.
Kinney, and the decisive action on Wed
nesday evening was the result of much
mature consideration.
As a nurse the committee has naught
but words of commendation to offer In
behalf of the deposed matron. Her of
fense Is an inclination to talk too much,
a tactless and outspoken preference for
some committeemen and an expressed dis
taste for others. Then the committee
also claims that Mrs. Kinney, whilp hav
ing the respect and admiration of her
nurses, did not exert a proper authority
over them, a lack of discipline that has
been most harmful to the hospital's wel
fare.
There was much heated discussion at
the meeting before the necessary vote
declaring tho position vacant was se
cured. No successor to Mrs. Kinney has
yet been named, and the committee hopes
to fill the position with some capable local
woman.
