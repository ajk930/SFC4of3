BRITONS AND BOERS RENEW BATTLE
Skirmishing Force Sent Out by
General White Encounters the
Transvaal Troops Near Lady-
smith, and Later Bivouacs for a
Second Engagement â The Brit-
ish Must Soon Face the Invading
Boers in a Decisive Battle.
CAPE TOWN, Oct 29.â The second battalion of the Gordon Highland
ers, the First Devonshires, First Manchesters, First Liverpools, Second
Dublin Fusileers, Liverpool Mounted Infantry, Fifth Lancers, Fifth Dra
goons, Eighteenth Hussars, Natal Volunteers, mounted battery and four
field batteries proceeded las: night to Lombardskop from Ladysmith.
A squadron of Hussars located the Boers, who opened fire with
shells and rifles. Two horses were shot and one trooper wounded. The
Boers occupied a strong position at De Waais Farm, and the mounted in
fantry failed to draw them out. As nothing could be gained by another
attack the column bivouacked and the Boers retired to Rietfontein. The
battle will be resumed to-day.
LONDON, Oct. 2S.â The South African war has now been in progress nearly three weeks, and so far the British arms
have been consistently crowned with momentary successes, though at a cost which verifies President Kruger's pre-
diction that the confiict would stagger humanity. But though victory has fallen to Great Britain whenever and
wherever the issues were of paramount Importance. General White's position to-day Is scarcely more reassuring
than at the outbreak of the war. So far he has only shown his ability to outwit by strategy the Boers' strategy.
That ln Its conception meets high praise from the British military critic-?. Now he appears to have reached the limit of
this game of war by which he was able to prevent the massing of the Boer columns, and must either meet the enemy's
combined forces or retreat. Many people think General White should rest content with the successes so far achieved and
fall back on Colenso, pointing out that he appears to be fully able to move his forces quickly and without deterioration. It
is scarcely probable that he will follow this course, preferring rather to hold Ladysmlth, though against much superior
numbers, until reinforced. It is the feeling that the general intends to follow the latter course that creates uneasiness,
for victories over Boer units are not believed to indicate that the same result can be achieved over the Boers when
massed. .
Compared with this impending movement about Ladysmlth the fate of Kimberley and Mafeklng and the progress of
the other Independent operations are almost insignificant. The rapidity of the Boer advance and the tenacity of the
endeavors of their columns to concentrate on General White have proved clearly that the Boers' plans were matured long
before hostilities displaced negotiations, and though they may be unable to stand before the brilliant charges of the
British troops or serve their artillery with the skill of their opponents, they are a mobile force and operate harmoni
ously under a carefully prepared plan of campaign.
No one seems to have the faintest idea of what condition will confront the British army corps upon Its arrival in
South Africa. Will it be an avenging force whose duty will be to wipe out the defeat of General White and the capture
of Mafeklng and Kimberley, or will it simply be a walkover Into Pretoria, dispersing Boer bands disintegrated by the
strain of a long campaign and discouraged by constant reverses? These questions are uppermost In the minds of all con
nected with the War Ofiice. By November 4 the last troopship should have sailed, but the army corps will scarcely take
the field until the end of December. There is a lull In the departure of the troops forming the army corps, owing, the
Admiralty officials say, to the troops not being ready. . _ '

NO EUROPEAN COALITION
AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN
Neither Germany, France Nor Russia Is at
Present in a Position to Interfere in the
South African Warfare. â  \,
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, Oct. 28. â New York cables inform us that England is threatened with a European
coalition. Correspondents of American yellow journals are evidently trying to earn their
salaries. Little is heard of this crazy scheme here. No one European statesman wastes an
instant over it. Even if the desire existed the moment is not ripe for a successful realization of
that desire.
Europe is busy with its own affairs. A boycott of England by. the powers is no more a
question of practical politics now than when Catherine of Russia conceived the idea, or 'when
Napoleon tried to put it into operation. A certain section of the press of different countries tries to
agitate the matter. It is the same section that tried to set Europe against America during the
Spanish war and failed. It will fail now against England. The public is indifferent. Statesmen re
alize that England cannot be brought to her knees.
At present Continental Europe can neither interfere nor offer to mediate. Nor have trie
powers any idea of doing so either. They know that England would reject even the most cour
teously presented offers of arbitration, if accompanied by a veiled threat that the war would be
come general.
What nation wishes for that? Not Germany. The Kaiser's sole ambition at present is to
develop a powerful navy. He is not seeking a quarrel. On the contrary, he is evidently convinced
that the welfare of Germany necessitates cordial relations with England until he is fully pre
pared to follow a different line of conduct. Commercial rivalry between the two countries is not
vet so acute as to render war absolutely necessary.
Not France. Her financial existence is bound up in the success of the exposition. The
Not France. Her financial existence is bound up in the success of -the exposition. The
mere cost of preparatory mobilization would be overwhelming at present. If any European coali
tion were to be more than a pasteboard display, that preparatory mobilization would â¢ become an
instant duty, and temporary ruin would result.
Russia does not dream of interference. Her trans-Siberian railway is too vital an under
taking to be jeopardized. Her Far Eastern policy is more important to her than the ; fate of the
South African republic, for, remember, if England absorbs the Transvaal, it will, only. be in imita
tion of what the Dutch did with Java, Russia with Finland, Germany with Alsace-Lorraine and
Schleswig-Holstein, and France with Madagascar. â¢
The conquest of one people by another has been excused if the conqueror brings with him
civilization and progress, law and order. So no European nation can throw the first stone at Eng
land on the score of the probable final disposition of the Transvaal. They will be more likely to
observe a very strict neutrality and try to share in the profits when the conflict is ended.
As in the case of Japan after the war with China, the American yellow journals are only re
peating the shrieks of the European yellow press when they send rumors of a European coalition.
The powers cannot combine. Dual and triple .alliances would never unite, for .England could
make it more profitable for either to have her help against the other. She is the weight to turn the
scales. The calling out of her naval force now is not a threat, but a hint. It is accepted as such.
It indicates that the Transvaal campaign leaves her still free to cover the seas with her swarm of
warships, fully armed and manned. The hint is not likely to be lost. France remains quiet before
it. Her Mediterranean squadron is left in the Levant. You may be sure that it would be recalled
quickly if a coalition was in the air.

BELGIANS SYMPATHIZE

,: BRUSSELS, Oct. 2S.â I am able to .assert that the British Government
has expressed to the Belgian Government Its regret at the tone of Belgian
! public opinion regarding the.' Anglo-Boer war. The press has almost unanl
-1 mously taken sides against England. ' Subscriptions are being, taken up for
> the Boer wounded exclusively, and some isolated, outrages, such as paint-
ing the words "Blood, blood, Boer blood" on the doors of the British Con-
sulate at Antwerp, have occurred. â  The truth Is that , before the war the
1 Belgians, who. framed their constitutions and customs much on English
l lines, had marked leanings toward Great Britain, whose examples they gen- .
( erally eulogized, rightly or wrongly. However, half- of the Belgians being
Flemish, they sympathize with the African Dutchmen because they are of
1 the same race.- Apart from this lt may be asserted that the King and the
âº Belgian Government authorities' are much annoyed at the demonstrations,

LONDON, Oct. 28.â A few days ago, a special cable to the Herald told of
the pathetic scenes outside the War Oflice among the crowds awaiting the
lists of casualties, as they were posted up. Every day it is the same. The
Pall Mall has indeed become a street of mourning, and every day are to be
seen ladies driving up. in carriages and hansoms with pale, anxious faces,
showing the awful strain upon their nerves and terror at the thought that a
blow may be awaiting them. As the: cables have shown the loss among offi
cers has been terribleâ heavier in proportion than the loss among the rank
and file. Even more pitiable to be seen are the grief-stricken men of all
trades, in working garb, spending their meal hours outside the War Office
seeking for news of their gallant sons, while red-eyed women with babes in
their arms are requiring about their husbands.
Severe as is the strain upon the War Office attendants, to their credit be it
said, nothing could be more gentle than their treatment of those anxious In
quirers. To comfort those poor people Is no easy task, but they do their best
trying to reassure them in cases of the wounded or where there may be some
doubt as to* the fate of their dear ones.- - â¢' *':;;*;:';;

BERLIN, Oct. 28.â war news ar-
rives here in a contradictory shape and Is
often unintelligible. The ' comment of
most of the papers, irrespective of party.
Is . anti-British and often couched in a
satirical and, taunting tone. The belief
is general that Great Britain thus far has

From the enormous percentage of loss
of British officers in South Africa the pa
pers; here argue that the Boers have not
lost their marksmanship during the long
term of peace, and they also acknowl
edge the superior bravery of the otlicers.
The .Tageblatt says: "The losses furnish
a brilliant testimonial of he heroism, of
the oflicers. No matter how the var and

Suit Filed by the CouQtry
Club.
v-Â»IUD.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 28.â The Country Club versus Everett Strain, Hugh
MeCurdy and David MeCurdy .was the title of a suit filed in the Superior
Court last Tuesday, but the nimrods of Marin state that it would more ac
curately have been entitled "The Aristocracy of Wealth versus the Tax
payers of Marin." The suit Is Instituted for damages in the sum of $500,
which the members of the club claim they have sustained by the defend
ants poaching on their domain. To Say that the feeling throughout the
county Is heated is to put the matter mildly. The local papers have taken
the affair up and are handling the Country Club without gloves, and the In
dignation is so great that an attempt will doubtless be made to have the
license of the Country Club revoked. As there are many legal difficulties
to be overcome if such a course be adopted, it is barely possible that the
Supervisors may totally prohibit the hunting of game altogether within
the confines of the county. Z 21CZ :-ZZZ:::%Z
It is alleged in the complaint that the three defendants passed through
the preserves of the Country Club and frightened away game. For this
damages are demanded In the sum of (800. The McCurdys and Strain are
themselves wealthy farmers and own princely hunting domains. They give
the freedom of their property to everybody fcr hunting purposes, and have
never yet turned the hungry huntsman who might have been so unfortunate
as to miss a train away from their doors. Their hospitality has always been
of a lavish nature, and the popularity resulting from their free-handed pol
icy has done much to intensify the feeling against the Country Club. All
three defendants have announced their Intention of fighting tho suit' to the
bitter end.
The sentiment commonly felt throughout the county over, the suit ls ijretty
fairly expressed by the following extract from to-day's edition of the Sausa
lito News: Z%t.]'-X'
"Yet in spite of all this the people of Marin County are asked by a club
of city aristocratsâ of money and pleasure to assess Everett Strain,
Hugh MeCurdy and David MeCurdy $500 damages for climbing a hill through
an almost impenetrable tangle of shrubbery. The idea is preposterous. We

the courts whoever encroaches upon the special privileges of wealth or tends
toward disrespect for the power that wealth bestows.".
to. England, may have the opposite effect
on the official attitude from the one in
tended. Germany cannot act with less
consideration toward Great Britain than
J'Vance and Russia show. It is a grave
mistake on the part of our rabid anti-
British statesmen to say that Britain is
isolated. She has the United States as a
close friend, as has been again demon
strated recently, when the Venezuelan
decision was rendered and the American
press found no fault with the verdict,
though the matter not so long ago was
almost made a casus belli by the United
States. Great Britain has Japan as an
other friend and may even count on Rus
sia's support in many instances. Above
all, it seems doubtful whether it would
be wise for Germany to make an enemy
of Great Britain at this juncture."
The correspondent also learns on ex
ceptional authority that Germany has no
Idea of Interfering with Great Britain in
South Africa now or later. All rumors
Heated to that effect are baseless and
probably circulated for a purpose. All

two taken prisoners by the Indians.

SAN RAFAEL. Oct. 28.â 1f the state
ments made to-day to Deputy Coroner j
Steven Eden are trueâ the Indications '
that such is the case are clearâ highbinder j
warfare, with its Inevitable carnival of j
murder and pillage, may be expected at (
any minute to break out simultaneously â 
between rival Chinese clans on both sides
of the bay. With this knowledge comes a
confirmation of the suspicions of the Ma
rin County authorities that Lee Doo
Teong, the Chinese found floating in the
bay at Sausalito last week, was murdered |
and that Wong Ho, his partner, gave per
jured testimony in order to suppress an
investigation by the "white devils.
Lee Doo Teong's body was found float
ing near the railway wharf at Sausalito
by Christian Ock, a longshoreman, and
an examination by the autopsy physician
showed that he had received a deep
wound from some sharp instrument un
der the left ear. There was no water in
the lungs, showing conclusively that
death did not result from drowning.
Wong Ho, a fisherman from the Chinese
fishermen's camp at Point San Pedro,
testified at the inquest that he was the
dead man's partner, and that Teong had
come to his death near that place two j
weeks before by being knocked, into the j
water by the Jlbboom of a fishing smack. i
As there was no evidence to the con- _
trary, the jury rendered a verdict of ac- j
cidental death. â ;}' â 'â¢ :'X':. yr^ -"â 
To-day two Influential members of the
Ning Yung Society came to this city from j
San Francisco and asked Deputy Coroner {
Eden to take them to District Attorney
Mclsaac. They asserted that last night j
Wong Ho went to San Francisco and ad
dressed a specially called meeting of the I
King Yungs, telling them that Lee Doo ,
Teong had been killed by Lin Hing Ching, ;
a member of the See Yups, as the result
of a row over the merits of their respec- I
tive clans. The weapon used was said to
be a boathook. The two Chinese said that ;
if the District Attorney would cause the
immediate arrest of .Lin Ling Ching and
prosecute him for murder highbinder
warfare might be averted; otherwise a |
disastrous feud between the See Yups and j
the Sam Yupsâ Ning Yungs all being Sam
Yup menâ likely to break out In the
Chinese quarter of San Francisco and at
point San Pedro at any minute. The in
formants declared that vengeance had
been sworn by the relatives of the mur
dered man and that they and his clans- |
men would endeavor to kill Lin Ling ;
Ching and the other three See Yups with i
him in the boat at the time the deed was
committed. ' !
District Attorney Mclsaac was out of
town and the Chinese failed ln their en
deavor to hold a conference with him. |
They departed for San Francisco on the '.
s:ls 'p. m. train, with the assertion that J
delay probably meant death to somo one.
Coroner Eden will himself officially ac- |
quaint the District Attorney with the con- i
versation between his deputy and the two j
Chinese, and it is probable that Lee Lin j
Ching will be arrested and prosecuted for j
murder. j* â ' â
The Chinese fishing camp at Point San
Pedro has always borne a very hard name
and bloodshed there is of frequent occur- 1
rence. There are about three hundred
Chinese at the camp. It is a place of
refuge for lawbreakers ln San Francisco,
who make it their hiding place until the :
police grow lukewarm over .their crimes, I
when they return to the scene of their I
misdeeds. ______________

MOSCOW, Idaho, Oct. 2S.â If the present j
rate of examining Witnesses is kept up, j
lt is probable that next week will see the ;
end of the trial of the Coeur d'Alene mm- |
, ers on a charge of holding up a United
j States mall train and for conspiracy. In j
the .Federal court here. This morning
the examination of witnesses for the â 
Government was commenced. The prose- j
[ cution attempted to bring out facts and j
I evidence to prove a conspiracy to blow
j up the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mill at
j Wardner and that to do this the miners
conspired to hold the trains and to do any
other act to accomplish their purpose.
The Government contends that the stop-
ping of the mail train was a concerted
and prearranged incident to the day's
proceedings and was a part of the con
spiracy to blow up the mill.
An important witness was Thomas
Ames, a member of the Wardner Union.
He stated that he was awakened early on
the morning of April 29, and was told
there. would be a meeting of the union in
the miners' hall. He went to Page's Ho
tel, and there was told that there would
i be no meeting, but to be on hand at the
I depot with his bundle of working clothes,
I as the train was coming with other mm]
] ers, and union men would -board it., He
did not know for what purpose. He was
! afterward told not to go, as his thumb
I was off, and this would be a mark to iden
| tify him, if the crowd got Into any
i trouble. He stated that previous to this
date delegations had been sent to the
I Hunker Hill | Company with proposition!
which were accepted; that he was dis-
I charged from the Bunker Hill Company,
j but had gone back since: that he saw fifty
, men with bundles near the train; that the
I Bunker : Hill manager was seen "by tho
j union men later and . that he -refused to
j talk or recognize them, . but witness dis
; claimed being a member of the delegation.
' He says Boyle was president of the Ward
! ner Union and O'Rourke secretary.
Albert Burch, the secretary of the Bun
i ker Hill mine, was called, and related
I the occurrences of the week preceding the
blowing up of the mine. He said that he
had found posted a notice of the miners
requesting him to get his men to Join the
union, and that he then discharged the
seventeen union men. He next saw the
strikers under the leadership of Ed Boyle,
I who made an address to different shifts
, to induce them to Join the union. In con
! elusion witness disclaimed the charge of
; attempting to Intimidate Simklns, a wit-
neSs to be used by the defense. :*-...
Joseph McDonald of Gem, manager of
the Helena Frisco mine, told of seeing the
| men going to Wardner. He said on ex
: amining the powder-house he found
eighty boxes missing; that the lock had
been broken. Lem Smith, a liveryman,
I the next witness, told of hauling five men
j to Wallace on the 2Sth; that they were
! Wardner men and that they were
{ miners.
All these witnesses gave details of oc-
I currences during the days preceding the
] explosion, and it was given to prove a

an Incident to the other crimes.
ONLY ONE
MINUTE OF
FIGHTING
Ex - Champion Fitzsimmons
Easily Disposes of Jeff
Thorne.
Thorne.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Oct 28.â Jeff Thorne of Eng
land was knocked out by Bob Fltzsim
mons in one minute of fighting at Tatter-
Ball's to-night. Thorne, who was evi
dently very much afraid of Fitzsimmons,
did not land a single blow and made only
one light attempt to lead with his left,
the blow falling short by several inches.
The blow delivered by Fitzsimmons was
a short left Jolt, which did not pass
through. six inches of space before land
ing on Thome's Jaw. After Thorne was
counted out Fltzsimmons picked him up
bodily and carried him to his corner,
placing him on a chair which Sam Fitz
patrick," who had been confident of
Thome's victory, had placed hurriedly on
the platform. " ; ->,â¢.:-'â 
Fitzsimmons was attended by Martin
Julian and Yank Kennedy. Thorne was
seconded by Sam Fitzpatrick, Patsy Ha
ley and Joe Sullivan. Fltzsimmons looked
fatâ at least eight pounds over weight
but otherwise he would have been in flrst
class condition. *Xx .-.V.
The men agreed to fight according to
Marquis of Queenberry rules, breaking
free.
Round Iâ Fltzsimmons began feinting
and Thorne appeared afraid and kept
away. Fltzsimmons led with his left
and missed. Fitzsimmons landed a
hard left on the chest. Fltzsimmons
landed a left on the face, feinted with
his right and missed a right for the
head. Fltzsimmons landed a left on
the Jaw, knocking Thorne down and
out Time of fight, one minute. ;
Thome fell flat on his back, his legs
drawn up spasmodically and he rolled
over slowly on his hands and knees In a
vain attempt to regain his feet The ef
fort was futile, however, and he fell flat
on his face, utterly unconscious.
Malachi Hogan, the referee, bent close
over him with his mouth at Thome's ear
shouting the seconds, but Thome lay like
a dead man. After turning over on his
face he neither moved nor seemed to
breathe, so completely knocked out was
he. â  *:â¢:**;, X . v-y.-'--;y, n:
Thorne, after being carried to his cor
ner, - was surrounded by a group of
friends, who labored anxiously to bring
him to consciousness. He was drenched
repeatedly with cold water, Fitzsimmons
in the meantime standing by, anxiously
doing what he could for the vanquished
man. Thome was held in his chair by
Sam Fitzpatrick and Joe Sullivan, and,
although able to move slightly, was as
dead to the world as when ha lay on the

mat. He was ln his .corner twelve, min
utes and was then carried from the ring
by his seconds, unable co walk, but hav
ing regained a small measure of intelli
gence. â¢ As he was carried through the
ropes he rolled his head wearily toward
Sam Fitzpatrick and '.said It*, was a
"chance blow." The right side- of his
jaw, where Fltzsimmons struck him, was
badly swollen. ' â ". , Â,
Fltzsimmons fought with all his -â  old
time fire and was. as spry and shifty on
his feet as he had ever been. He appeared
many pounds overweight from his proper
condition, but was as quick as lightning
with his hands, and no victory that ever
came to .him was won by- more brilliant
work than this. 'â .-:....
His feinting was extremely rapid, and
his blows shot in so fast that Thorne was
beaten at the start. He had no confidence
when .he put lup his â  hands, and every
blow landed by Fitz made him more ap
prehensive than before. His face as the
men met in the center of the ring was
white and drawn, and at , every feint
made by Fitz with either hand he would
duck In a. scared way as though afraid
that the end had already come. He
ducked when Fitz was five feet away,
with no Intention Of striking at him. He
was utterly outclassed in fighting ability,
and through his own lack of confidence
lost every chance he might have had of
winning or staying the limit.
The bout was to have been for six
rounds and It was generally believed that
Thorne, on account of his showing against
Craig and McCoy, would be able to last,
if. not the limit at least three rounds.
Sam Fitzpatrick. his backer, expressed
himself before the men entered the ring
as being confident that Thorne would win,
saying if he did not believe so he would
never have brought him to Chicago to
fight Fltzsimmons. After the fight was
over he held to the opinion that the blow
which knocked out his protege was a
piece of luck on the part of Fitzsimmons,
but those who had seen Fltzsimmons
fight before knew better. It was the same
lightning jab that won Fitzsimmons the
championship at Carson, the same quick
blow- that laid Peter Maher on his back
for two minutes at Langtry, Texas. it
was the blow that Fitzsimmons has al
ways used and generally with decisive
effect when it reached the point where it
touched Thorne to-night.
SAYS THE
BOUT WILL
BE BRIEF
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 28.â Although only '
six days Intervene between now and the
date of the world's championship prize
fight betting on the result ls singularly
light. Interest in the battle between Jef
fries and Tom Sharkey for the champion
ship of the world Is keen enough, but the
supporters of both men seem loth to wa
ger their money on the result.
Jeffries' admirers seem to outnumber
Sharkey's. Just now Sharkey's: backers
want 10 to 7 for their money, and some cf
them are looking for 10 to 6.
Both men are In as good condition as lt
ls possible to get them in for the fight. If
anything has been neglected lt is too late
to supply a remedy. Jeffries says he is
satisfied with his condition, and he pro
fesses to believe that the battle will be a
short one. In the opinion of many good
judges it will be well for him if it is short,
and the shorter the better. Although a
bigger and heavier man than Sharkey the
champion will not stand so much rough
work.
To-day Jeffries had not decided whether
he would do much work to-morrow.
Sharkey will do none beyond taking a
walk and a little light exercise with the
bag. The sailor never works on Sunday.
The training quarters of both men prob
ably will be overrun with visitors to
morrow, so that neither could put in a
good day's work if he desired to do so.
Jeffries will remain at Allenhurst until
Thursday, when he will come to this city.
Sharkey will come to town on Thursday.
WILL FIGHT THE'
ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE
PASADENA, Oct. 23.â Since the forming
of two sanitary districts in this section
by election on October 10 the fight be
tween the saloon men and anti-saloon men
h*s grown hotter. The districts were
marked out by the Anti-Saloon League
and the election was looked after by the
league, which retained . attorneys, know
ing that they woul be necessary to hold
the ground gained by the election. *
The first step taken by the anti-saloon
element after the election was to call for
a tempocary injunction to be served by
the Superior Court on the County Board
of Supervisors restraining - them, on the
ground of technicalities, . from counting
up the election returns and declaring the
districts established. From 10 o'clock in
the morning until 3 o'clock In. thÂ© after
noon was absorbed ,in â¢*â ' Judge Trask's
court In hearing the arguments on both
sides.
C. C. Wright, author of the Wright Ir
rigation act, who has been retained by
the Anti-saloon League to represent them
in Southern California and Deputy Dis
trict Attorney D. C. Wilbur defended the
law for the people and for the County Su
pervisors respectively. Attorneys F. F
Davis and D. C. Morrison fought for the
saloon men. M. Rlcard of Lamanda Park
and H. C. Werner of North Pasadena.
Judge Trask decided in favor of the antl
saloonlsts, dissolving the injunction pro
ceedings on the ground i that it was hot
proper to bring such a suit ln a court of
equity.
The County Clerk and Board of Super
visors are bound to count up the returns.
The law Ib mandatory on that question,
said the Judge.
Immediately, the attorneys for the sa
loons gave notioe of appearand say that
they will make the costs come upon the
new sanitary board If the Clerk declares
the board elected. The County Clerk has
done so, and the members of the new
board have received their certificates.
Thus -the situation has -narrowed down
to this: The districts are established and
the boards may now elect their officers,
but they are chary of transacting any
business and have entered into earnest
consultation- With their attorneys. They
have assumed an attitude of defense,
leaving the saloon men to take offensive
steps.,- â  - -' x â¢*
! The latter element say they will fight i
every inch of the ground, declaring that j
the saloon feature of the sanitary dis
trict, that is, the feature which gives or |
refuses: liquor licenses within the bounds
of the district, has never been tested in
the Supreme Court.
- The saloon-keeper at Lamanda Park |
says if he is driven out he will immedi
ately move farther east, to Sierra Madre;
and the Sierra Madre people, hearing this,
have begun to talk of forming a sanitary
district of their own. The saloon-keeper !
ln North Pasadena District talks, if the
worst comes, of moving farther north to
a place called Devils Gate. <â¢
A colored preacher who heard this, re- I
marked that that was the proper place for
him to go; and now the saloon-keeper has
learned that ? Devils Gate is inside the
sanitary district.
â¢ The feeling is so hot that Frank E.
Simons, who disturbed an anti-saloon |
rally by calling Rev. Dr. E. S. Chapman i
of Oakland, State superintendent of the |
league, a liar, was arrested, and after I
two days' jury trial, fined $25. . * !

"A 'CITIZENS OF SAN FRANCISCO RALLY TO
THE STANDARD OF HON. HORACE DAVIS
Immense Throng
Cheer His
Name.
Republican Candidate
on Crest of Wave
of Popularity.
C 3HE great demonstration of Repub
lican unity and enthusiasm at
Metropolitan Temple last night in-
spires the people to battle with
ii renewed vigor for the election of
Horace Davis and his associates on the
Republican ticket. The prolonged and
hearty cheering of the multitude which
greeted the nominee for Mayor was a
spontaneous tribute of the masses to his
worth ami Intelligence. These great ova
tions ln honor of a candidate signify con
fidence in his leadership and are harbin
gers of victory for the cause which he
represents.
In this campaign the massesâ the labor
ers, the mechanics, the merchants, pro
fessional men and taxpayers generally
have resolved that national Issues shall
he considered In their relation to the
progress and development of the commer
cial and manufacturing Interests of San
Francisco. Free and intelligent men will
not allow a candidate for offlce, even the
Mayor himself, to dictate to them what
issues shall be discussed.
Horace Davis' manly and modest speech
p.' Metropolitan Temple last evening add
ed to the list of his admiring legions. He
seemed to the people a great man and
pre-eminently noble in contrast -with Phe
lan, who spoke on the same platform Fri
day night. It was In the minds of tho
people that the outgoing Mayor uttered
a tirade of threatsâ threatening that he
would not under the new charter appoint
on the non-partisan commissions any Re
publican who should bring national prin
ciples into this local contest. Phelan pic
tured himself as a little oligarch who
would proscribe men for devotion ,to their
flag and country.
It was the talk among Intelligent Dem
ocrats yesterday that the Mayor had lost
is head again and made another bad
break. He blundered when he publicly
stigmatized Horace Davis as a traitor.
He blundered grievously when he sug
gested to the men employed at the Risdon
Iron Works that they should not wave
the starry flag in this campaign. His
declaration Friday night that he would
proscribe certain Republicans was worse
than a blunder. Evidently lt was not in
his mind that the constitution of Callfor
nit gave to every citizen the right to
speak his sentiments freely.
Phelan ls losing ground every day. His
followers are alarmed, fearing that the
Mayor in his desperation will consign
them to political perdition. The Repub
licans are gaining In strength and confi
dence every hour. Everywhere Horace
Davis is greeted with waves of popular
enthusiasm.
Temple Taxed to It 3 Limit
Seldom has the capacity of Metropolitan
Temple been BO severely taxed. There was
not a vacant seat from the edge of the
platform to the uppermost tier of the gal
lery. Rows of men stood along the side
aisles, while the rear of the hall and the
doorways were so crowded that it was
almost impossible to get in or out of th*
hall. The audience was an impatient one.
Long before the time set for opening the
meeting the restless ones began to ap
plaud. Their effort at nolsemaking was
taken up by others until the applause and
cheers were almost deafening.
This was the condition .'.hen Chairman
Al ivier of the Republican County Cen
tral Committee marched on the platform i
followed by the speakers of the evening i
a:.1": the guests of honor. Among these '
were C. L. King, Colonel T. V. Eddy, Asa
R. Wells, Charles Laumeister, A. P. Van
Duzer, Irving M. Scott. William J. Brady,
Hon. George C. Perkins and a host of j
other prominent Republicans. Hon. Hor- !
ace Davis came in during the progress
of the meeting. His appearance set the j
audience wild and it was several minutes j
before the spirit of enthusiasm ran its
course and the cheering ceased. Selections
by the Knickerbocker Quartet did much
to add to the success of the rally.
Mr. Bouvier announced that Hon. John
F. Davis had been hastily called away
just before the opening of the meeting
and would not be present. He also read
a telegram from Hon. F. X. Schoonmake^
stating that he had missed his train at
Dos Angeles and was too far away to
walk to the meeting. William J. Brady
was introduced as chairman of the even

' Cheers Greet Senator Perkins.
' Cheers Greet Senator Perkins.
The audience had had time to recover
its breath and when Senator Perkins
stepped to the front the yelling and cheer
ing was renewed. The Senator said:
"This splendid audience of men and wo
men speaks more potently than words
that the people are thinking. When the
people think it Is a bright augury for the
success of the Republican party. The
greatest duty of the citizens is to take an
Interest in elections. All source of power
is lodged In the people and must come
from the people. All of us want good
government and good laws honestly ad
ministered. W* all want value received
for the taxes we pay. All of the great
political parties have the same object ln
view, but they differ in the means of
gaining the end. Ally yourselves with
the party that most nearly represents
your ideas and you will make no mis
take. â¢ .Â». â¢ ;

what they have doneâ by their standing
in the community. Horace Davis has
lived here for forty-seven years. Ho is
not like William J. Bryanâ seeking otflce
for what there is in it. He wants it for
the honor of the position and for the good
he will bo able to do for the city he loves.
"The charter provides for eight com
missions of public utilities. Whom can you
trust so well to appoint the members of
those commissions fairly and honestly as
the Hon. Horace Davis? He will bring
into oflice with him his years of business
experience. He will give the city the ben
efit of all the years he has devoted to the
public service. The city owes him a debt
of gratitude for consenting to become a
candidate for the office of Mayor.
Many valuable franchises have been
given away during the regime of our
Democratic opponents, and . yet they
claim to be the friends of the people and
to administer municipal affairs in their
interests. The Democrats say, 'Don't talk
national politics in the municipal cam
paign.' Well, if the national administra
tion was Democratic I would recommend
taking their advice. The best Democrats
have come over to the Republican party
and the bad Republicans have gone into
the camp of the enemy."
Davis a Friend of "Workingmen.
Senator Perkins referred to Hon. Horace
Davis' record on the Chinese question
and stated- that when the Chinamen
threatened to .boycott his flour because
of his working for the exclusion act in
Congress he replied that the good of his
fellow, workmen was worth more to him
than all of the trade of China. In clos
ing Senator Perkins said:
. "The election in this great city will be
felt throughout the entire State. If we
elect the Republican ticket Its influence
will be for good."'
The band played and the Knickerbocker
Quartet followed with a patriotic selec
tion which was heartily encored.

Irving M. Scott was the next speaker.
and spoke in part as follows:

"I have lived in California through what
I may call Its sleepy period, during the
last ten years, and I have seen It respond
to the Impulse of prosperity which began
to dawn upon the country with the in
auguration of the magnificent administra
tion of William McKinley."
Mr. Scott then proceeded to pay a glow
ing tribute to the national Republican ad
ministration, and declared that he hoped
not oniy for success for the party in the
municipal campaign but also that the
vote of California would be cast for Wil
liam McKinley for a second term as Pres
ident of the United States. He declared
that the war in the Philippines was due to
the fact that a few young and ambitious
men thought more of personal aggrandize
ment than they did for the future of their
country, and had Incited the natives to' a
futile but bloody resistance to the author
ity of the United States
Praise for the Candidates.
; The speaker referred to the Individual
candidates .of the Republican party in
glowing terms. He laid especial empha
sis on the splendid official records of
Auditor Asa R. Wells, who. he declared
was the best Auditor San Francisco ever
had; and of County Clerk William A.
Deane, whose administration has been
above criticism. Continuing, he said-
â¢ "I ask you whether you can pass over
the claims of an honest, successful busi
neaa man of ripe judgment and progiea-
Bive tendencies, and a Republican and
vote for a young Democrat with no spe
cial business training, even though he be
energetic. .
"I. call upon you who can draw, the line
between Improvements and confiscation
to vote for this. ticket, that .we may ride
over good streets and enjoy the advan
tages of good sewerage, at a reasonable
rate of taxation. It is your right and
privilege to . exercise your Judgment in
fasting your ballot, but there are times
when individual preferences - should give
way to, the -dictates of party exigencies,
and I urge upon you to go to the polls on
election day with the firm determination
to vote for the Republican ticket from tcp
to bottom." â 
The applause that followed completely
drowned the music of the band and did
not subside until the appearance of the
popular Knickerbocker Quartet . again
commanded silence. The quartet sang
a "take-off Phelan's candidacy that
brought down the house.
Davis Receives an Ovation.
At this point Horace Davis entered and
the great audience rose as one man in a
wild outburst of enthusiastic 'welcome.
Mr. Davis was at once given the floor and
spoke in substance as follows:
"If anything could inspire, me to elo
quence it is this great and enthusiastic
audience, which is here to-night. I am
particularly pleased to see so many ladies
present, for this, you know, is . a home
campaign, and when the ladies manifest
such a strong interest ln . the meetings
and in the. result of the election It speaks
well for the success of the . Republican
"The subject that we are here to discuss
to-night is the future government of the
city. I want to say to you to-night, as I
have said to you before, that I have been
vltallv Interested in this new charter, as
I have been' interested in charters before.
I was a member of the charter* convention
and I do not know why Democrats should
continue to question this fact. During the
months the charter convention was ln ses
sion I attended all Its meetings whenever
I was in the city. I also attended all the
meetings of the committee of which I had
the honor of being a member, and, as
some of you will remember, I had the
honor to preside at the meeting held after
the convention had concluded Its work to
ratify the charter which it had compiled.
i also wrote personal letters to such mem-
â rsi .of,_ the Legislature as I- thought I
might have some influence with, urging
them to vote for the charter and not Ho
go contrary to the will of the people, who
desired a just and modern form of gov
ernment in place of the present slipshod
municipal machinery with which we are
Incumbered." . , ;.
Eulogizes the Ticket.
Mr. Davis then devoted a few minutes
to eulogizing the capabilities and hon
esty of the other nominees of the Repub
lican party, v.ho, he declared, were men
of Irreproachable character and consti
tuted the best ticket that could have been
selected. As for himself, he was averse
to self-praise, but he believed his record
was well known to the people, and on
that record he was prepared to stand or
fall.
"If you feel that, in view of my record,
I am worthy of your confidence," he said,
"then I ask you to vote for me."
An uproar of applause interrupted the
speaker at this point, and when the
clamor had in a measure subsided Mr.
Davis said quietly, "I see there are a few
here who Intend to vote for me."
Mr. Davis then proceeded to discuss the
policy of the national administration and
the prosperity that is now being enjoyed
over the entire length and breadth of the
country, and asked lf the people of San
Francisco desired that the announcement
should go forth that this city, which had
received and was receiving the great bulk
of this prosperity, had turned Its back
on the party that was responsible for it
all. He concluded with an eloquent ap
peal to the Republican voters of the city
to get out and work for the success of the
entire ticket. He declared with sincere
earnestness that the battle could only be
won by energetic, conscientious work. He
urged all who had not already done so to
join the clubs and work among their
neighbors and friends for the success of
the Republican party at the polls on No
vember 7. As he took his seat a man ln
the gallery proposed three cheers for
Horace Davis, and they were given with
tremendous enthusiasm.
When Phelan Deserted the Charter.
"In IS9C I was a member' of another
charter convention; Mr. Phelan was; we
eleven were; and we wanted a president.
I first suggested James D. Phelan for that
position, and when he was nominated I
made the seconding speech. When James
D.' Phelan was elected" and when he went
to his chair at our head he said: 'Gen
tlemen, I am in favor of this charter, I
will work with you for it and will fight
for it until It is settled at the polls.'
"At that time Sam Ralney was looking
for a man to tako the Democratic nom
ination for Mayor. He offered it to Mr
Phelan and Mr. Phelan went before the
convention and got it. .. The next day he
came before us, the members of the char
ter convention, and said: 'Gentlemen, I
have accepted the nomination for Mayor
and upon the advice of my friends in the
Democratic party I have come to the con
clusion that I may have nothing more to
do with this charter project'â and right
there James D. Phelan took. the orders
of his new-found boss, Sam Ralney and
offered his peremptory resignation as
president and member of the charter con
vention of 1896." ...
This section of the powerful speech of
Judge A. P. Van Duzer was a revelation
to that audience of thousands; that it had
its effect goes without saying. It was
known to many that Phelan had forsaken
the city in 1596, but never before had the
statement been made by such competent
authority or with such positlveness and
directness. Van Duzer minced no
words In that nor did he In drawing the
obvious parallel between the character of
Phelan as then displayed and the "char
acter of Horace Davis as demonstrated by
a long life in politics and out of It. Cheer
upon cheer went up. as he -shot out his
telling charges and twice when he would
have ceased he waa called back to the
rostrum.
"Mayor Phelan came before the people
when he first ran for office and with many
words promised to stop the stealing that
had been going on and he did not do It
He promised again last year and didn't
He's before you . again with . the same
promise and to prove to you that he
won't and cannot when the bosses bring
the pressure to bear upon him I'll just
read you a few, figures." And 'then the
speaker brought the books to show that
despite Phelan promises the .*â¢ administra
tion of the city by him had : cost nearly
a million a year more than' under any
previous rule. -
Home Rule Not an Issue.
Colonel Eddy's arraignment c of those
Republicans the Democrats are wont to

opening he called attention to the fact
that , his audience . had < had the privilege
of i listening to a coterie of the greatest
men ever brought together under one
roof in California and he paid high in-

dividual tributes to Senator Perkins,
Horace Davis and the other dignitaries
on the stand.
"I will not use the few minutes I have,"
said Colonel Eddy, "in any invidious
terms or comparisons; I will simply say
that when James D. Phelan, Franklin K.
Lane or that splendid journal, the San
Francisco Examiner, talk to you of 'home
rule' they talk clap trap. We have home
rule and have always had it. and if it has
not been successful it is chargeable to the
people. The question of this campaign is
not home rule but who shall rule. Shall
we turn the city over to Phelan, the Dem
ocratic party and. home rule or shall we
turn it over to Horace Davis, the Repub
licans and good rule."
He dealt with the Phelan Senatorial as
pirations in no light manner, and set it
well before his audience that the flght
of Phelan and the Phelan Democracy was
not so much to assure good government
to San Francisco as to secure to Phelan
the political machinery with which to
work out his bigger aspirations.
"The test of your Republicanism next
year," said he, "will be whether you voted
for Horace Davis or James D. Phelan at
this election. If for Phelan you will not
pass muster as a good Republicanâ and
you should not. I will not say that the
Republican who votes for Phelan this
year, in the face of all the issues at
stake, is a traitor to his party; I will
simply say he is not a good Republican
and never can be; furthermore that ho
never was."
OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE.
Merchants quested to Allow
Employes Plenty of
Time.
I The directors of the Merchants' Associa
tion, which now numbers about 1100 busi-
ness firms of this city, passed a resolution
at their last meeting requesting all mem-
bers to make arrangements so that their
employes may vote on November 7. Yes-
terday, in compliance with the resolution,
the following circular letter was sent out:
â¢ To the Members of the Merchants' As-
sociationâGentlemen: Your board of direc-
tors has been requested to call the special
attention of the members of the associa
tion to section 1212 of the Political Code of
California, requiring all employers to allow
their employes two consecutive hours in
which to vote on election day without any
loss of employment or wages. In comply-
ing with this request, this board respect-
fully suggests that it Is a patriotic duty to
permit each employe, who is a voter, suf
ficient time to vote at the coming election,
so that the general interest in our munici-
pal affairs, which this association has fos
tered and encouraged, may be kept up and
result in permanent good government for
our city.
It is recommended -that our members ar-
range beforehand to open their respective
places of business a little later on the
morning of November 7; or, if this is Im-
practicable, to permit as many of their
' employes as can be spared in the morning
to vote before they come to business and
to permit the others to leave for the day
ln time to reach their respective voting
precincts and vote before the closing of the
polls. . **. y_:. si:
Through this arrangement,, very* â  little
time need be lost and full opportunity will
thus be given for all employes who may
wish to vote. On the other hand, should
there be no uniform course of action ln
this matter, it Is probable that municipal
elections, like other elections, will be made
legal holidays, which would entail consid
erable loss upon trade and industry. The
polls will open election day, November 7,
at 6 a. m. and will close at 5 p. m. Very
truly yours,
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE MER-

feet and at that level became a source of
surprise by the volume of oil that sud- j

workmen were engaged in lowering more

er that the derrick became loosened and j
tools were sent flying in all directions
The flow is now twenty-four barrels an

WILLIAM WANTS
A HEW CABINET
Desires Changes to Get
a Big Navy.
Copyrighted. 1599, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN", Oct. Emperor William Is
looking for another Cabinet, but has not
yet found the material for it. In place
of Dr. yon Miquel, the Minister of
Finance, his Majesty wanted Herr Sie
mens of the Deutsch Reichsbank. and .n
place of Herr Thielmann, the Minister of
Public Works, he wanted Herr Jencke,
the Krupps' general manager. But they
both declined on Sunday, the reason
being that their present Jobs are more lu
crative, so the Emperor ls still seeking
other suitable men. One of the reasons
why he desires new men is that he wishes
the navy greatly Increased, and faster
than at the present rate, and he ueems the
existing Cabinet too yielding to efficiently
push these wishes before the Reichstag.
The Emperor's Hamburg toast is gen
erally Interpreted as urging the necessity
of a much larger navy, while an inspired
article in the Nord Deutsche Allegemelne
Zeitung, apparently contradicting the
Idea, 16 regarded as intended to smooth
matters. Admiral yon Tirpltz. Secretary
of the Navy, has received his Majesty's
sanction to project an enormous increase
of the navy, giving it fifty-seven battle
ships, fifteen large and thirty-six small
cruisers, and making it equal in size and
efficiency to any other navy, Great Brit
ain's excepted. This would involve an ex
penditure of 1,700,000 marks and make thÂ»
naval budget 212,500,000 marks annually.
Later to-day it was learned from an ab
solutely reliable source that Prince Ho
henlohe had agreed to the folleiwln.^ new
naval programme, and that the Govern
ment, the Emperor consenting, will pre
sent the programme to the Reichstag be
tween 1901 and 1903. Instead of one ship
each year three will be built annually un
til 1916. From these vessels a new third
squadron will be formed and also reserve
squadrons In place of the Siegfried class.
The number of cruisers in foreign waters
will be increased by six large vessels.
The Emperor has been of the opinion
since 1597, when the present p;an was
adopted, that the political situation of the
world has changed so enormously since
the Spanish-American war, the seizure
of Kiaochou, the looming of the whole
Chinese question and the development of
Japan as a big maritime power that it
would be a suicidal policy for Germany
to stick to- that plan; that It would be
tantamount to her abdication as a big
power; and he trusts that there is enough
patriotism in the Reichstag to insure the
Increased navy which Germany needs to
fully play the role he believes Is her due.
The correspondent here of the Associ
ated Press recently had a conversation
with an employe of the Foreign Office
who fully enjoys the Emperor's confi
dence, and he took special pains to assure
the correspondent that the projected in
crease must in no sense be construed as a
menace to any power or group of powers.
He added: "For a colonial power like Ger
many, it has become a matter of necessity
to get a bigger navy. Recent events show
how necessary it is."
It Is Interesting how public opinion has
taken this idea of the Emperor. Its re
ception has been most varied. The whole
Agrarian press seized the opportunity to
assure the Emperor that the Agrarians
are quit* willing to vote for a bigger navy
if he will drop his canal project. The
Kreuz Zeltung says there is not enough
money to pay for both. The Centre or
gans declared that the absolute necessity
for the increase must be shown before the
Delegates in the Reichstag vote for It,
and the National Liberal. Reichsparte,
Pan-German. Anti-Semite and a number
of non-partisan papers discuss the plan
rather favorably. .
On the other hand, the whole Radical
and Socialist press decries the need of the
increase. These papers claim that the
masses have about reached the limit of
taxation and ought not to be further bur
dened under any circumstances. The
opinion of well-informed politicians is
that Prince Hohenlohe will be only too
glad to resign as soon as the Emperor
finds a suitable successor, hut It will be
difficult to replace him In these critical
times. So far his Majesty does not know
whom to ask to step into Prince Hohen
lohe's â hoes. He has no Intention of re
placing Count yon Buelow, the Minister
of For-Â»i-m Affairs, although the latter for
some time has been the butt of a large
portion of the press, owing to what the
newspapers consider lack of courage and
pluck in dealing with recent questions <-f
foreign politics. The entire jlnsro pres*
violently attacks him this week for his al
leged subserviency to Great Britain and
the Unit*.' States In the Transvaal and
Samoan matters. The pr'ss continues to
discuss these questions repeatedly.

BERLIN, Oct. 28.â Samoa continues to
exercise the press, which indulged this
week in the wildest surmises. On the
authority of the Foreign Office and the
United States Embassador, Mr. Andrew
D. White, the correspondent of the Asso
ciated Press Is in a position to say 'hat
the present situation is that the negotia
tions between Berlin and Washington
some time ago reached a satisfactory
agreement, and those between Berlin and
London are progressing satisfactorily.
The chances that they will shortly reach
a definite and satisfactory conclusion have
appreciably improved during the last few
days.
Great Britain seems on the point of
yielding, to a certain extent, to Germany's
claims and representations of major right*
in the Islands. At present it looks as
though Great Britain would retire alto
gether and leave Germany in sole posses-
sion of Upolu, Savail and other islands,
except a coaling station at Pago Pago,
belonging to the United States. This so-
lution, ln fact, has been reached In prin
ciple, but what equivalent Germany Is to
cede to Great Britain Is yet In doubt.
What has just been said shows the earn-
est desire of the German Government to
remove all ground for friction with the
United States. As Indicating an equal
wish to cultivate the most friendly rela
tions, may be mentioned the delicate com-
pliment paid the United States on the oc
casion of former President Benjamin Har
rison's visit to the new palace at Pots-
dam, when the Star 3 and Stripes were
hoisted on the palace. This was the first
time they ever floated over a royal Prus
sian or Imperial palace.
Another attention was shown General j
Harrison. When the personnel of the
United States Embassy was entertained
at dinner by Prince Hohenlohe, the latter
and all the German officials present did
not wear their decorations, as a delicate
compliment to the American guests.
The last of the new chain of forts about
Metz has just been begun near Point de j
Jour. Ten million marks will be spent on
i these fortifications this year and during
â â  the coming spring. About 1500 men, most- :
ly Italians, are employed on them. The
war Office is experimenting on a large ;
ale 'with Russian frozen pork, mutton
and beef.
Miss Regina Mueller, a German-Ameri- !
can, has erected a flne villa on an estate j
' covering seventeen acres of ground, at
Spreenhagen. near Berlin, which has just
been opened as a home for cats. Dr. j
Eugene Wasdin, past assistant surgeon
of the United States Marine Hospital ser-
vice, has arrived here after a tour of in-
spection of the continental ports. Lieu- j
tenant Commander William H. Beeler, the
United States naval attache, starts on
home leave on November 2.
MORRISON THINKS HIS

New Irrigation Scheme.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Oct. 28.â A big irri
gation scheme started to-day on the
southern boundary of this county. The
plan is to tap the Santa Maria River to
get a flood of water for irrigation pur
poses. A company has been organized
with a capital stock of JIOO.OOO to lay an
Irrigation system to supply a large terri
tory. In the bed of the river an excava
tion twenty-five feet deep has been made.
For this pit a heavy wooden flume four
and a half feet square, of heavy lumber.
will be laid underground, to reach the
surface at a distance of two miles from
the river. The water gathered comes up
from the bottom of the river bed, and
when the flume is full will have a pres

John G. Price of Sknguay Chosen to

Coming Session, of Con-

BY HAL F. VI AN.
Special CcTT-f-svctv-leric-a at The Can.
JUNEAU. Ale-ska, Oct. I*.â The Alaska
Territorial Convention; called for the pur-
pose of preparing bills and making sug
gestions to Congress for laws for Alaska.
â¢which har. been ln .... â  era since Oc
tober 9, concluded Its labors to-night. It
bas made history for Alaska, as is shown
by the following nine days' proceedings.
A. represeentatlve to Congress was -fisoti-d
*nd â cess wÂ»Â« memorialised to allow
bim the H privileges of the floor of tho
House. Ex-iJuvsruor A. P. Swihsford w*
elected president oi the convention ai*
llai Hoffman secre-ter-f.
Tbe convention htus been Quito * repre
sentative body. Much Interest was shown
In the -.vork. Klfty-two delegate* wÂ«*-ru in
attendance, representing not jniy tne
comparatively thickly populated aoutn-
oastern Alaska out such faraway pre-
cincts as E.*ig<e City on the Yukon and
Urea en Prinoe VUinam Bound.
.-,vÂ£vfe-ay nil* given the principal honor
ot tiio convention in the Representative
to Congress, but no: till alt-jr a rtgnt ol j
two b-asÂ»iona and a.fu-r Juneau ar.d .ts
anied delegations iiiid experi-Â»ncÂ«d a Â°Â°\l' j
einng ot heart. It was the sense Oi tne j
convention that this honor waa not un-
deserved; for Skaguay baa be<-n defeated
for the chairmanship and her delegates
bad done much of the hard committee
work. At one time Skaguay wa< prac
tically defeated for the Representative, :
una u.e feeling between the rival cities |
threatened to come very bitter, but tnis
was happily averted In the end.
A resolution providing for a territorial
form of government for a. *â¢..*.*< a. was of-
fered ana tabled. It still lies there, al-
though at tirst there was a considerable ;
â sentiment ln the convention in favorof
euch organized form of government. The
convention had nothing to say on thÂ©
question.
lillls for submission to Congress wero
mission to C< mgress were
prepared on the subjects of civil govern- j
nient; civil cede, criminal code, public
lands ar.d land ,-x, education anu mv-
nicipal government. A bill to provide a
military backbone for Alaska did not
The delegate elected is charged with the
duty of taKing all this voluminous work
to Washington and endeavoring to have
it passed d\ Congress, The convention
cV-ts not expect that the bills will meet
uitfc the approval ot Congress letter for
letter; but it will be eatiy disappointed
it tie main points are not sanctioned.
The delegates; many of whom were law-
yers, being residents of Alaska, presume
that they Know better than, the individual
members of Congress what legislation Is
bs what
moet suitable for the district of Alaska,
and that was the foundation of the hold-
ing of the convention. Most of the re-
ports of tho several committees begin
witii these words: 'tie it enacted by th.c
se words
nate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress
* gre^s
assembled."
The civil government bill fixes Sitka as
â¢ men! bill Axes Sitka as
the temporary scat of government of the
district; provides for tne appointment Of
a Governor, who ie empowered to grant
r-r'prieres for offenses committed until the
decision of the I'resident of the United
States ib mado known; and he shall per- \
form generally ovor the district such ..as i
ay pertain to the offico of Governor of a
Territory". He ls required to inquire into
â  ::
the operations of any person, association
or corporation authorized to kill the seal !
or fii her fur-bearing animals and annually
!
report to Congress the result of such in-
vestigations. The bill, among other
: .
things; also provides for the election of -.
delegate to congress by the quaiiried elec-
tors of tho district; for thtee judicial dis
tricts and three L'uited States District
Judgesâ one in the Vukou at Circle City,
c l'uk 'ii at Circle ( 'it;.*,
another at St. Michael and the third shall
reside at Juneau; and defines to some ex-
tent tha powers, duties and jurisdiction of
the courts. All United States Com-
missioners shull heitafter be kuown as
I'robate Judges; and it defines tneir Juris-
diction. The Governor, Secretary, Dis
trict Attorneys. Judge*, Marshals, Clerks
and Probate Juelj^ea shall be appointed by
the President by and with the consent of
the Senat'Â». and salariees are fixed by the
proposed act as follows: â -..- , |4000
per annum; Judges, $8000; Marshals, i- â¢-
Clerks. iflCOO; District Attorneys, MOW);
Probate Judges, as recorders, 12000 and
fes; Probate Judges other than those
acting as recorders, $3000; deputy mar-
shals. $1200 and fees, mileage an other
-allowances; assistant district attorneys,
JLZuO; deputy clerks. JIOOO and fees for rm-
cording instruments.
Three recording districts are provided
for, allowing miners in any organized
mining district to make rules and regu
lations governing the recording of notices
of location of mining claims, water rights,
flumes and ditches, millsitefl and affidavits
of labor. The District Judges, Marshals.
District Attorneys, assistant district at-
torneys. Clerks and office deputy mar-
shals" are paid their traveling expenses
by a provision of the act.
A resolution was adopted roqu-esting the
Attorney General of the United States to
cause the appropriation for a courthouse
and jail at Juneau to be used at once,
and calling bis attention to the present
inadequate quarters provided for the
.United States District Court and the Jail,
which Is described as unfit for human
habitation.
Ttie bill prepared by the committee on
* Tred by the committee on
civil Code and Code of Civil Procedure
is principally amendatory to sections re-
ferred to In the Oregon and other codes,
with the aim of fitting it to the conditions
peculiar to Alaska.
The bill on Criminal Code that will go
Tt" bill on criminal Code that will go
to Congress is simply what its name sig
nifies. It defines crimes and fixes pun- i
ishment therefor, and is not essentially
di(T-*rent from other criminal codes. It :
provides ....... punishment for robbing or
maliciously i ring flumes, sluice-boxes
or anything iti general pertaining to mm- '.
ing or mining claims. Sections in this bill i
fixing a license on various businesses, ''oc-
cupations an.l vocations ln sums ranging
from $10 to $500, in accordance with the
present law Imposed by the last Congress,
and reducing ilejuor licenses much below
the figures lixed ln ttie present law, were |
-stricken out by the convention.
In the course of the debate on this
In t ' * a deb ite on this |
matter it was declared by Delegate Cobb
of Juneau thai every one of the Congress-
men who visited Alaska with whom he ;
talked on the subject gave It as his opin-
ion that the vocation tax law is unconsti
tutional. It ls not Improbable that lf the I
next Congress does not repeal the law Its I
constitutionality will be tested In the Su
preme Court of the United States by Al- *
aska Interests. Alaska attorneys iri gen-
eral think tlie law unconstitutional. Al- !
askans do not co much object to paying
a tax as they do to paying it in a manner
required of n>i othÂ«r people under the I
stars and stripe-.
The location of mining claims by power
Thr local â¢ claims by power I
of attorney iS lade null and void In the
bill reported on public lands and land !
laws. This Is something new, and is I
partly due to tho complaints from Porcu-
pine and Cap-s Nome against powers of
attorney being used in behalf of friends *
at homo, to tho great disadvantage of
men who spend time and money and labor i
in getting to the diggings.
The education committee made a recom-
made a recom- '
mending report, which exposes the few '
Shreds of the educational system ln Al-
a.Â«ha. Thero are 1106 white children of
school age In the district, it states. This
1. regarded as an underestimate, as a
number of towns in the Yukon Valley and
v the westward were not taken into' con-
sideration. The number of schools la four
and the number if teaohers seven. Atten- 'â 
tion is called to the utter inadequacy of
the educational system and it Is recom-
rr. er.ded that an appropriation of 176,000 be i
i, ,dp by Congress at the earliest possible
d*-e.te for tho purpose of erecting new
fhool lings, furnishing and equipping
tie same and paying tha necessary teach-
ers. The adoption of tho public school i
System of the State of Washington Is rec- '
ommended so far as it ls applicable.
Municipal government, with tbe usual !
city fleers, Is provided for the cities and
villages of Alanka by the committee on
municipal government.
This completes the bills that will be pre- j

ABOUT FLOOD WATERS.
THE CALL is in receipt of a communication
from Mr. George H. Maxwell, executive chair-
* man of the National Irrigation Congress, in
which he strongly antagonir.es his own statement c:
the purpose of the convention to be held in this city
on the 14th of November. He says: "The State
movement seems to have been started with the idea
of discouraging the movement of the National Irri
gation Congress.
That is not our understanding 61 it at all. "The
That is not our understanding ol it at all. "The
State movement, so called, is not intended to an-
tagonize anything but drought, nor to promote any
thing but the provision of water to increase the fer
tility and product of the State. So far, indeed, the
antagonism comes from the opposite direction.
Gentlemen interested in the national movement have
done the antagonizing and have not avoided the in
cendiary resources of the language in doing it. In
deed the pyromaniac nature of some of their utter
ances has increased the need of water, for it would
be useful to pour on the conflagration of accusations
*-
whicii they have enkindled.
There is no need of any of this. California has no
intention of making it hard for anybody to get the
Federal Government to appropriate the money
needed for a national system of irrigation. The old
flag and an appropriation are just as dear to us all as
to Mr. Maxwell and the Missoula Congress. But this
State has many millions of dollars' worth of property
in water poured upon its mountains every year, not
by the Federal Government, but by the laws of evapo
ration and precipitation, both dependent, we may ob
serve, upon temperature. The annual waste of these
millions in that property, brought about by the law
of gravity which makes water run downhill, obso
letes the use of nearly twenty millions â of acres of
land which is infertile without irrigation. If that land
would produce only five dollars per acre if irrigated,
annually, its non-use is a loss of one hundred millions
of dollars per year to" the State's production. That
means the support of many more homes and families
than we have now.
If we were talking about anything but water we
would say that by permitting the waste of its prop
erty in water California is burning its candle at both
ends. Let it go that we are not merely wasting at
the bung, or the spigot, but have knocked both heads
out of our barrel: It is unfortunate that to any mind
in this State the proposition to get together and dis
cuss the conservation of this property for its proper
use should appear as the small scheme of selfish
plotters, or, as Mr. Maxwell puts it, as "a wild and
chimerical . project, with possibilities of corruption,
jobbery and public plunder which are simply appall
ing."
There is nothing in it to justify any such view.
The State of California, on the whole, has been
as well governed and as uprightly as that larger sov
ereignty, the. United States, and as free from corrup
tion, jobbery and public plunder. Mr. Maxwell
simply submits the argument that we are too dis
honorable, dishonest and untrustworthy to do this
tiling for ourselves, therefore we must wait, like the.
blanket Indians, for the "Great Father" at Washing
ton to do it for us!
If his estimate of California is, true he should not
ask the Federal Government to irrigate the State, but
to turn it into a penal colony, a Botany Bay, to which
the criminals of.the Union should be exiled to grow
up in. .congenial company.
" The National Irrigationists are earnest people. We
respect them. But they have one foible. They pub
lish all who differ in the means to the same ends as
dishonest and unworthy.
Dr. J. C. Crane, the newly elected medical superin
tendent of the Agnews Insane Asylum, has filed an
emphatic objection to the political methods of the
Governor as practiced upon the unfortunate beings
confined in the asylum. Before Dr. Crane is much
longer in political life he will discover that the po
litical wisdom of Gage is hidden under the hat of
Dan Barns and will be exercised in whatsoever
direction will do the Mexican the most good.
It is generally agreed that the new Alaskan modus
vivendi between the United States and Great Britain
will prevent collisions. The Southern Pacific might do
i goodjstroke of business by purchasing a couple and
letting nature take its course.
WOE TO THE CONQUERED.
THE absolutely personal nature of Mr. Phelan's campaign has been abundantly cvi-
denced. His Committee of One Hundred controlled the convention that nomi
nated him. It shut out the aspirations of other men, honorably entertained. It took
at his dictation Dr. Dodge, and by the same command it nominated for other offices Dr.
Dodge's deputies. It was a close corporation affair, and developed the corporate evil of
perpetual succession.
The charter contemplates a bi-partisan organization of the various executive
bodies of the city, the Fire and Police Commissions and the Public School Board. This
feature of the charter was a powerful influence in securing its majority at the polls. It
should be administered in the spirit of that feature in all respects to which it applies.
But Mr. Phelan announces that he will not so administer it. In every speech he
makes he calls all Republicans who support Mr. Davis "enemies of the charter." He declares j
them to be "traitors" and their support of Mr. Davis to be "treason." As if this were
not enough, in harsh characterization of his political opponents and their purposes, while
among them are thousands as honorable, with as great a stake in this city, and as deserv
ing as any in the ranks of his personal following, the Mayor has gone to the length of a
specific declaration of his purpose in forming the bi-partisan commissions. In an address
on Friday night to the Monticello Club, a non-partisan organization, Mr. Phelan said:
"The charter provides that as many Republicans as Democrats must be appointed to the
public commissions, but I want to say right here that if any Republican expects to be
represented on those commissions he must come from the ranks of those who meet us on
an equality. No traitor to the charter, no Republican who has dared to force national
affairs into our local campaign, will be given consideration." So, under Mr. Phelan, that
feature of the charter is to be violated. The commissions are to be uni-partisan, filled
with the personal partisans and supporters of Mr. Phelan. As he impeaches all Republi
can supporters of Mr. Davis of treason to the charter, because they adhere to the whole
body of principles of their party and declare its full counsels, they "force national affairs
into our local campaign," and he will outlaw them in the executive government of the
city!
He already cries "Woe to the conquered!" He will select the commissions from
the ranks of his supporters, and the people he calls "traitors" will get no consideration.
Men like John S. Hittell, the historian of California, Louis Sloss. Irving M. Scott, Isaac
Upham, Sheldon Kellogg, and the long list of intelligent, respectable, public-spirited Re
publican business men, are to be denied representation in the government of the city.
That is not the purpose and spirit of the charter. When Horace Davis is elected he would
look upon it as aii abuse of his power, a civic crime, to fill these commissions only with
men who had supported him. He will look upon it as his duty, the only way in which
his oath to do his duty can be fulfilled, to go outside the ranks of his personal supporters
into the midst of those who opposed him in constituting the bi-partisan commissions. Any
other course would make his official oath perjury and stain his lips with false swearing.
But such considerations make no appeal to the conscience of Mr. Phelan. He does
not propose bi-partisan executives as the charter demands. lie announces that instead
of executing the charter in that 'respect he intends to install a Phelan oligarchy in office,
and at the very moment of its vital institution to violate the charter and turn it into a
personal political machine. Yet he calls other men "traitors" to the charter!
It is enough to make his Grand Old Man Britton pick up his grand old grip and
drop out of the Phelan procession.
The Phelanesque organization in the Democratic party is exactly in line with his
declared purpose as to the public commissions. It is a Phelan oligarchy. All Democrats
outside of it have been treated as "traitors" to Phelan. They have been denied the right
to present gentlemen in conventions as candidates for nomination to office. In the last
convention only those who were rounded up and branded with the Phelan mark were
given consideration. It was a personal affair entirely. It is natural, therefore, that he
should carry the same system into organization of the government under the charter. His
success in his own party has emboldened him to declare such to be his purpose. His
proclamation of outlawry sets a price upon the heads of all Republicans who do not sup
port him.
The friends of the charter now act with notice and knowledge. .
THE INDORSEMENT OF WHEELER.
PROMPTLY and spontaneously the merchants,
the manufacturers, the business men of the
coast generally, have rallied to the support of
'. William R. Wheeler, the Pacific Coast candidate for
the position of Interstate Commerce Commissioner.
The indorsements have come from individuals, from
1 trade organizations of various kinds, and from Cali
fornia, Oregon and Washington alike. The sneak
tactics of the Southern Pacific Company to defeat
the desire for a Commissioner from the coast having
been exposed by The' Call, the people have taken
j vigorous measures to baffle them. The outlook for
'. success is now promising. For once at any rate the
Pacific Coast States are united.
Mr. Wheeler was agreed upon for the office by
the delegates representing Washington, Oregon and
California at their conference in this city because
j they recognized in him the man who is best fitted to
'< fill the position and perform its duties. The mem-
bers of the conference knew their constituents wish
a business man recommended for the place and acted
in accordance with the wish. There was no intention
|on their part to antagonize the Southern Pacific.
i They seek from the Interstate Commission .noth
| ing that would inflict any wrong on that or
! any other corporation. They were engaged in con
i sidering all the interests of the coast and sought only
jto promote the general good. The opposition made
, by the Southern Pacific in putting up a candidate of
J its own was due solely to that spirit of domination
' which appears to animate Huntington in everything
and which prompts him to actions which show a de-
termination to rule or to ruin the State.
Just as the railroad resolved that if it could not
elect to the United States Senate a representative of
the road rather than of the State there should be no
| Senator, so now it has determined to have from this
i coast a railroad lawyer on the Interstate Commerce
Commission or prevent the choice of any man at all
' from this coast. Such is the antagonism that has
{ been raised against Wheeler. From no . other
| oource has there been manifested any opposition to
| him at all. The issue, therefore, is between the coast
I and the Southern Pacific. It is the choice of the
| representative of the business men of three States or
the representative of a Kentucky corporation doing
i business in California solely for the purpose of im-
posing upon its industries as heavy a burden as the
traffic will bear.
The Senators and the Representatives in Congress
from the coast are expected in this issue to side with
the people and stand firmly for the candidate they
have put forward. Assurances have been given from
all sides that business men are as a unit for Wheeler.
He has been indorsed by associations which never
" â  before have recommended any candidate for political
1 i office. The support given him is as cordial in Los
; Angeles as in San Francisco, and in Oregon and
â  Washington as in California. It is. as was said by the
1 Portland Oregonian last Wednesday when Mr.
â  Wheeler's .selection by the conference was announced:
"The people of the coast do not want a politician,
' ! they want a business man who has not only a knowl-
edge of the details and principles of traffic, but is
also familiar with the necessities of the coast. Tlieir
choice has fallen upon such a man, and the unani
mous indorsement of so representative a body of
men as the executive committee of the Pacific Coast
Jobbers' and Manufacturers' Association is certainly
;â â  entitled to consideration."

GERMAN ARMY EXPERIMENTS.
REPORTS of the results of the German army
maneuvers for the year contain much interest-
ing information concerning the adaptation to
military uses jdl carrier pigeons, trained dogs, bi
cycles, balloons and automobiles. In the operations
90.000 men were employed and the field of the
maneuvers extended over a wide range of country, so
that every means of communication between distant
posts was tested and its value calculated for use in
case of actual war.
The campaign was conducted in a country that
was to a large extent mountainous, and there were
heavy rains during nearly the whole period, and yet,
despite the uneven nature and wet condition of the
roads a large number of bicycles were used for car
rying dispatches and proved to be of great service.
It is said that during the whole week of the
maneuvers dispatches were carried at night from the
field of battle to the headquarters at Karlsruhe by re
lays of ten men. a distance of about sixty to eighty
miles. If bicyclists are suddenly attacked on the road
by cavalry and have not time to take up a position
of shelter they dismount, lay their machines flat on
the road, retreat ten paces, and receive the cavalry
with quick fire. It is a curious -fact that horses have
a most decided objection to charge a bicycle spread
but on the road.
The use of the automobile is said to have been a
brilliant success. Those tried were very small, with
two seats, for officer and driver. They carried dis
patches or elderly staff officers quickly from one po
sition to another, and sometimes attained and kept
up a speed of forty miles an hour. There were several
accidents, mostly at night, from reckless driving.
Further experiments, it is said, are going to be made
in this direction, especially with regard to motor
cars as luggage-wagons.
Dogs were used to carry ammunition to the front
and dispatches to the rear, and are said to have proven
very useful auxiliaries to the army. Those used were
thoroughly trained and were as alert to do their mili
tary work as a sporting dog is to do the work expected
of him in the hunting field. Extensive use was made
of pigeons, but nothing of novelty was noted in their
service. The operations of the balloons were hin
dered to a great extent by the rainy weather and
very little if any improvement was noted over the bal
loons of former years. It is stated that wherever the
Emperor. stood a signal balloon with a flag attached
was sent up in order to enable the orderlies with dis
patches to find him at once. Every time his Majesty
decided upon ending the maneuvers for the day a
large round ball was sent up to the signal balloon.
Another novelty was the introduction of an oxygen
light for signaling purposes.
The experiments with all of these equipments show
how eager the Germans are to make use of everything
that can be of any service whatever in war. Whether
it be man, dog, bird, machine or just plain gas, the
Kaiser will bend it to his military service if he can.
When Germany engages in a war everything German
will be involved in it.
It is noted that in Tom Reed's application for ad
mission to the bar in New York he declares. an in
tention to. become a permanent resident of that State.
so Maine will know him no more except as a summer
boarder or a tourist" or something of that kind.
It is said that the press censorship at Manila is
to be made more rigid. General Otis ought to finish
his gigantic job of suppressing the news by cutting
the cable. ."-.*.*;â¢
EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfIUGHT.
General Sir Redvers Buller, now some
where on the deep blue sea on his way to
South Africa to take command of the
British forces and act with a free hand
against the Boers, has been termed "a
â¢brute" ln sundry reports given of his
character when his sudden attainment of
fame made him Interesting to the Ameri
can public. There are other reports, how
ever, that do him more honor and are
more to the credit of those who circulate
them. lie won the Victoria Cross by
risking his life to save that of a trooper
under his command who had been wound
ed by the Zulus and had fallen from his
horse. Buller saw the man fall, turned
and rode back in the face of the pursuing
foe, picked up the wounded Briton and
carried him to safety. The Victoria
Cross bears the simple inscription, "For
Valor." Perhaps Buller won it by "brute
courage," but it will be conceded at least
he is not a common brute.
From an account given of his life In the
Westminster Gazette it appears Buller
came of an old and wealthy Devonshire
family, and had he chosen might have
lived the life of a country gentleman
hunting foxes and playing golf "all the
same Blingum." He chose, however, to
do other things. "Eagles do not catch
flies" is the motto of his family, and he
has lived up to It. lie served In South
Africa working hard in training the
blacks to be soldiers Instead of staying
at home to train puppies to hunt par
tridges. He also raised a troop of light
horse, of which he took the command.
This regiment was recruited from the
wild, adventurous spirits with which Cape
Colony abounded. Many of them, it Is
said, had been no bettor than lawless
brigands, but Buller so Infused Into them
his own intrepidity and discipline that
they were as tractable as any regiment of
the line, and their prowess during the
Zulu war was unrivaled.
Until Puller's character ls revealed ln
the red, fierce light of war for all to read,
we must perforce rely upon the testimony
of others in forming an opinion concern
ing it. and perhaps as good an account
of him as can be obtained just now is
that given years ago by Archibald Forbes
In describing his career during the Zulu
campaign. Forbes said:
"Here was a man with some six thou
sand a year, a beautiful house in fair
Devon waiting for his occupation; a seat
in Parliament all but secured: and yet
for the patriotic love of leading that
strange medley of reckless adventurers
he was living squalidly In the South
African veldt, sleeping in the open for
three nights out of the six with a single
blanket thrown over his body; his hands
so disfigured by cattle sores, the curse of
the veldt, that I never saw them not ban
daged up. With Ills intrepid heroism he
had saved the lives of so many of his men
that, In talking to them, it almost seemed
that he had saved all their lives. A
strange, stern, strong-tempered man,
Whose pride it seemed to be to repress all
his own emotion and to smother Its dis
play ln others, he would order a man per
emptorily back to his duty who came into
his tent to ask him to read a letter ln
which a mother thanked him for saving
the life of her son."
Bullfr, like Dewey, had to wait a long
time for the opportunity of supreme
command at a crisis In the history of his
country to come to him. He Is 60 years
of age. It is said he has seen more active
service than any oflicer in Europe, and
his friends assert he has genius. Such ls
the "brute" who will lead the Briton
against the Boer, and It looks as if Oom
Paul had his match.
â¢ â¢ â¢
There have been many descriptions of
Dewey as an admiral, as a hero, as a
modest -gentleman, as a Presidential prob
ability and as an ornament for parades,
but I have seen but one effort to describe
him as any ordinary fellow would be de
scribed by a casual acquaintance; and
that is sufficiently excellent to be worth
quoting. A Philadelphia man told the
Philadelphia Record thus:
"I saw Dewey. I conversed with him.
He had his hand on my shoulderâ this
one. the leftâ here, just over the shoulder
blade. I observed him well. His gray
morning coat and waistcoat were not ex
cellent. They did not balance, and the
waistline was not well marked. They cost
no more than 530, I am sure. His patent
leather boots were pointed, actually point
ed. I shuddered when my eye fell on
them, and mentally put their price at $5.
His collar was good in shape, but was
laundered with a gloss and by machinery.
All collars should be laundered by hand
and have no gloss, of course. His tie was
madeâ he had not tied lt himself! You
can buy such ties anywhere for half a
dollar only, of course, you wouldn't."
That Impartial account of the hero's
dress, given with the calmness of a Phila
delphia society leader, is all that was
needed to lift Dewey's popularity to the
highest pinnacle. It is now clear we can
say of him with strict veracity: "He's a
dandy, but he's no dude."
There Is one more Dewey story to be
told. It is one that has something of a
mystery In it, and may raise a stormy
controversy between Vermont and Con
necticut. The correspondent of the Hart
ford Courant. in giving an account of
Dewey's reception at Montpelier, inti
mates that the hero is not a Vermonter.
He says: "We Connecticut people consent
to temporarily consider Montpelier as Ad
miral Dewey's birthplace. We have heard
on what we decide to be good authority
that he was born In Connecticut, but lt
seems ungracious at such a time as this
to make too much of a matter of detail
now that all Vermont has turned out to
welcome him." And again, in describing
the appearance of the admiral, the writer
says: "A few of us think he shows unde
niable traces of the distinction of his Con
necticut birth."
That is the story as it stands. Vermont
so far has not deigned to notice the insin
uations, treating them in fact as if they
were no better than Connecticut nutmegs.
It is, however, to be hoped the challenge
will be taken up and the issue decided:
not that it makes any difference to the
nation whether Dewey were born in this
or that locality of the republic, but be
cause It will add much to the enlighten
ment of all to learn what are the undeni
able marks of the "distinction of Connect
icut birth." .

three important contributions. Each
comes from a man who has assumed the
presidency of a great university, and each
therefore is something, more than a mere
academic discourse. It is a manifesto of
a plan of campaign to be entered upon
at a seat of learning and gives promise
of action as well as words of counsel.
The three men are: President Wheeler
of the University of California, who is
entitled to precedence partly because he
is one of us and partly because he made
the best installation address of the three;
President Arthur Twining Hadley of Tale
and President "William Herbert Perry
Faunce of Brown. There was an agree
ment among them that American univer
sities have broken from the traditions
of the past, have entered upon a field of
work whose limits are not yet defined
and are grappling with problems not fully
understood. Pres'dent Faunce said: "The
modern university must be catholic in
Its attitude to all realms of knowledge
and must recognize all honest intellectual
endeavor." President Hadley said: "The
Yale of the future must count for even
more than the Yale of the past In the
work of the city, State and nation. It
must come into closer touch with our
political life and be a larger part of that
life." President "Wheeler outlined a pol
icy of action at Berkeley which, if car
ried out, will touch and adorn every ac
tivity of our people from planting pine
trees on the hills of Amador to selling
prunes to the people of the Philippines,
and between those extremes will include
the improvement of poetry and art in
San Francisco.
Truly the university is about to become
a universalityâ an encyclopedia of all that
and perhaps some day may Include
journalism.
â¢ â¢
The installation address of President
Wheeler has been so recently published
and reviewed in The Call that further
notice of its excellences are not needed.
Some of the things said at Yale and at
Brown,' however, have not been widely
published here and therefore are worth
noting. President Hadley said he does
not wish Yale to become a university for
rich men's sons or a university where
the student body is divided Into two
classesâ the one rich and the other poor.
Furthermore, he declared himself of the
opinion there Is a tendency toward over
doing the beneficiary fund business in our
colleges, and that what the college stu
dents really need is not gratuitous aid,
but more and better opportunities to earn
the wherewithal to meet their college ex
penses; that all scholarship aid beyond
the tuition fees, whether for undergrad
uates or for graduates, should be dis
tinctly in the nature of a prize for really
distinguished work or a payment for ser
vices rendered. In other words, remun
eration, rather than pauperization, should
be the principle underlying such aid.
Such a statement on the part of the
new president throws a strong side light
on some of the problems they are strug
gling with at Yale. Too many rich men's
sons on one side and too many gratui
tous students on the other are giving to
Yale a social atmosphere that is more
European than American. The same evil
Is doubtless experienced at Harvard, and
the time may come when the young New
Englander who wishes to go to a uni
versity where he can enjoy a true democ
racy of companionship will have to seek
it somewhere In the West.
The problems at Brown are different I
from those at Yale, but they are just as j
hard to solve. It will be remembered by
those who take an interest in university ]
affairs that at the time of the controversy
over the attempt to force the resignation
of President Andrews it was stated that
Rockefeller had declared he would have
given Brown University $100,000 had it not
been that the doctrines of finance and of
political economy expounded by Andrews
were unpleaslng to him. As Andrews
eventually left the university, it has been
frequently asserted that the president
chosen to take his place would be satis
factory to the man of many millions who
has a fancy for having universities run
according to his notion. It was therefore
something of a surprise to a good many
people that in his inaugural address
President Faunce said that any college
that should receive any gift whatsoever
on condition of making the donor's per
sonal private views the standard of In
struction would be guilty of an inconceiv
able degradation, both of Itself and of
the cause of education which it misrepre
sents.
So now Rockefeller will not give that
$100,000 to Brown. The University of Chi
cago will have no rival in his affections
and President Harper will have the ex
clusive privilege of teaching Rockefeller
ology and applying it to the whole domain
of human learning.
â -** \ â ?â  * â¢ *
There is one point of Faunce's address
which may not have been Inspired like a
Delphic oracle, but is certainly just about
as incomprehensible as one. He had
stated that a modern university must rec
ognize "all honest intellectual endeavor,"
and lt would appear therefore that it
ought to recognize woman's endeavor, for
from a university point of view a woman
can be both honest and intellectual; but
none the less President Faunce went on
to say: "In New England to introduce
women into what has been for a century !
a men's college, with no change in cus
toms and atmosphere; to allow them to j
think that the adoption of masculine tra- ;
dition is essential to emancipation, this is |
to Inflict a cruel wrong on young woman
hood."
What ls meant by Introducing a young
woman to a men's college without a
change of atmosphere is not clear, nor is
it clear how such Introduction would lead
them to the adoption of men's traditions
and inflict a wrong on them. It might be
well for Brown to get an atmosphere less
laden with tobacco smoke, eliminate tra
ditions that would wrong a woman and
give the girls a chance. Even Rockefel
ler's Harperverslty does that.
As the trustees of the public library of
Oakland excluded from its shelves the.

merit because it was not fitted for circu

RAILROAD AFFILIATION
BARS GENERAL CHIPMAN
Modesto Herald.
The Call vigorously combats a proposi
tion looking to the appointment of Gen
eral Chipman of Red Bluff as a member
of the Interstate Commerce Commission,
arguing that he is too closely allied with
the Southern Paciflc Company to be
placed in a position to pass upon Inter
state railroad rates and regulations. And
The Call ls right. Chipman in every other
respect Is eminentlyâ even pre-eminently
qualified for the position, but his known
affiliation with the Southern Paciflc Com
pany would destroy his usefulness, no
matter how honest his motives. And the
honesty of Chipman's motives would be
questioned, be it noted, by men who have
known him to accept railroad â¢ "sugges
tions" in politics to promote railroad ends.
But while a known ally of the Southern
Paciflc Company should by no means be
made a member of the Interstate Com
merce Commission, it by no means follows
that a known enemy of our great railroad
corporation should be named for the
place. The appointee should in this re
spect be as free from prejudice as from
favor, and a man who could neither be
influenced by railroad pressure nor by
"popular clamor" incited by metropolitan
papers for selfish and spiteful purposes.

be given an unfair advantage.
Friday evening John Garner appeared at
the i race of District Attorney Sproul
ntid stated that he desired to make a
clean breast of the crooked business with
which he had been connected. Before al
lowing Garner to make his statement
Sproul informed him that lf he should
make a -statement it would be on his own
peril. He reaffirmed his desire to relieve
himself of the story. After he had stated
all he went to his home. This morning
Sproul went to Garner's home with the
Wiitten statement and it was read In his
presence by one of his bondsmen -*-*?â¢!""
ne^r pronounced it correct, signed his
nnme and made affidavit tn It.
District Attorney Sproul was Inter
viewed this afternoon, and for the reason
stated above refused to give the details
of the confession. He stated that the con
fession is of the same character of evi
dence as that given by the other im
portant witnesses; that Garner beratne an
attesting witness to the will after the
death of Fuller for a money eonsldera

Garner related the details of the bar
pain made with Rodley. Rodley promised
to pa him $5000 for attesting the will
Having made the confession Garner stated
that he felt as tnough a terrible burden
was raised from him.
PubUc svmpatby has been strong In
Garner's favor for the reason that It is
believed that If a conspiracy was formed
to rob the Fuller estate Garner's was not
the evil mind mat managed the affair.
The news of the confession reached about
noon the ears of those who had agreed to
become sureties on his bail bond and those
who qualified in the largest amounts
therefore refused to sign.
This afternoon Dr. Rodley was taken to
the County Jail at Oroville. he having
failed in his effort to secure the requirea

WILL APPLY TO THE
COURTS FOR A DIPLOMA
Novel Suit Filed by a Student at the
State Normal School.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 2S.â A suit that will at
tract the attention of pupils and teach
ers all over the coast will be commenced
here in a few days. The plaintiff will be
Henry Miller, a student at the State Nor
mal School, and he will try to force the
faculty of that institution to graduate
him. Miller, who is nearly 45 years of age,
has been a student at the school for about
five yoars. He has also spent some time
at the San Diego and Los Angeles nor
mals and has been employed ln teaching
in various places. At the time of the
graduating of the last class he passed in
all studies except manual training.
In this Mrs. Place, teacher of that de
partment, refused to pass him and Prin
cipal McNaughton and tbe faculty notified
him he had better leave school as he was
unlit to graduate. Miller was refused
further admission to the school, but
through the aid of Attorney Morehouse
and threats of suit he was allowed to re
sume the study he was deficient in.
The next class graduates Friday, and
Miller's name Is not on the list. He will
not be allowed to graduate. Miller de
clares he will cite the faculty and trus
tees in court to show cause why he should
not be given a diploma and also demand
$50>X) damages of the trustees.
Miller 16 especially bitter against Mrs.
Place, who refused to pass him In manual
training, and this lady is frightened of
him to such an extent that she has told
her friends he may attack her.

HEART DISEASE.
Some Facts Regarding the Rapid In-
crease of Heart Trouble.
Heart trouble, at least among the Amer-
j leans, is certainly Increasing, and while
I this may be largely due to the excite-
1 ment and worry of American business
j life, it is more often the result of weak
' stomachs, of poor digestion.
Real organic disease is incurable; but j
l not one case in a hundred of heart trou-
ble if- organic.
The close relation between heart trouble
\ and poor digestion is because both organs
are controlled by the same great nervesâ
the Sympathetic and Pneumogastrlc.
In another way also the heart is af-
fected by the form of poor digestion, ;
which causes gas and fermentation from '
Half digested food. There Is a feeling of
' oppression and heaviness in the chest
: caused by pressure of trie distended rto*
: macn on the heart and lungs. Interfering
, with their action; hence arises palpitation
i and short breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
making it thin and watery, which irri-
tates and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for heart
trouble la to Improve the digestion and '
to insure the prompt assimilation of food. !
This call be done by the regular use
after meals of some safe, pleasant and
effective digestive preparation, like
I Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which may
be found at most drug stores, and which
contain valuable, harmless .digestive ele-
ments in a plea-pant, convenient form.
It Is safe to nay that the regular per-
sistent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
at mealtime will euro any form of sto-
mach trouble except cancer of the sto-
mach.
Full sized package* nt these tablets sold
by druggists at 50 cents. Little book -an
stomach troubles mailed free. Addrees F.

GLOOMY OUTLOOK
IN PHILIPPINES
Months of War With
But Trifling Gain.
INSURRECTION IS GROWING
LITTLE TERRITORY CONQUERED
BY AMERICANS.
Special Dispatch to The Pall.
CHICAGO. Oct. 25.-The Tribune to-day |
prints a summary of the situation in the!
Philippine Islands from its special cor-
respondent there, Richard H. Little. The
letter, which is dated Manila., September \
I*4 , Bays:
Here are some figures, made seven
months and a half after our campaign
against the Filipinos began. Say lt Is
fifty-one miles to Angeles, we hold pos-
session of the railroad up to that point. !
We can fairly claim possession of the
land a half mile on each side of the track.
We have possession of the wagon road.
and, let us say, a half mile on each side 'â 
from San Fernando through Bacolor to :
banta Rita eight miles, with four miles
to r,u?sa- " c have a road from Malolos
to I llauag, eleven miles northeast. We i
can claim eleven square miles here.
ue have Manila out as far as the water I
works, five miles away. That gives us, I
say, twenty-five miles around the city.
1 hen we have the road and a half milo
each side down eighteen miles to Imus.
T hen we have Calamba and some other
points. on the lake that General Lawton
captured before he was ordered back. !
These towns are not approached by road, I
but by .boat across the Laguna de Bai,
and we only control the land they !
stand on. j
Adding up our total possessions, we find
we have 117 square miles. The island of
Luzon contains 42.000 square miles.
Outside of Luzon the Insurrection seems
to be growing. The insurgents hold ports
In Mindanao, the next largest Island to I
Luzon in the Philippines, and said to be j
incalculably rich in gold and silver mines.
Iron and copper ores, coal and other mm
erals, besides possessing wonderful forests !
of hardwood. No Americans have dared
venture there as yet, as General Otis has
sent no trooops to the island. Englishmen j
and Germans are prowling about the isi- I
and getting all the concessions they can. j
It Is said several prospecting parties are
at work. j
General Otis reports conflicts between
"robber bands" and American soldiers in
Negros and Cebu. The Nineteenth, the
Eighteenth, the Sixth and one battalion of
the Twenty-third Infantry are now In
these two islands fighting the "robber
bands." who dig trenches and occupy
towns and make night attacks after the
fashion of the insurgents in Luzon. A
late report from Luzon ls that some 2000
"robbers" were menacing our forces and
a collision was imminent.
The next campaign Is going to be differ- ;
ent from the last. We will get out of the \
flat, open country into mountainous,
thickly wooded country. If we do not
end the war here we will have to carry It
into the high, rock-ribbed mountains of
Luzon. It will be no violation of a state
secret to say that the first object of the
next campaign will be to take the rest of
the railroad from the hands of the insur- i
gents. The insurgents ought to be firmly
convinced by this time that we want the
Manila and Dagupan road, as we have j
fought along that line seven months, j
They know we want it, and they also
know that we are going to get it, for they
are already tearing up the track, burning
the ties and burying the rails north of j
Angeles.
The country east of the railroad, north j
of Angeles to Dagupan, Is much like It is
south to Manila, except higher and more
broken. West of the railroad are high
mountains, that still offer the' insurgents
better opportunity of retreat and escape
than they had in the low country. With
the taking of the railroad we will havo
cut off the provinces of Zamhales. Pag- !
gaslnan, Tarlac and Panpanga, and Ba
taan from the main part or the island,
and ran lay claim to a good deal more
â country than the precise amount of real
estate on which our army is now camp
ing.
From the railroad Aguinaldo's army can
hftrdly retreat anywhere but northward i
across the mountains to the fertile valley !
of the Rio Grand* de Cagayary.
The "walled city" cannot understand
why the army has so much trouble with
the railroad. When the officers in the
field notify the 'walled city" that the j
rails have been torn up from the section |
of track just captured and that the ties
have been burned and the grade de- i
rtroyed, they get an order to "fix it."
So after a few miles' of railroad are cap
tured the soldiers have to scatter up and
down the track and go mining for steel '
rails. The insurgents bury the rails five
or six feet deep. They observed that
the Americans located the rails by sound
ing with a crowbar, so they resorted to
the expedient of putting a layer of ties
over the rails. To replace the burned
ties the quartermaster's department was
forced to use planks, two boards each
two -lies wide being nailed together for
ties. The sidetrack, wherever possible all
the way back to Manila, was jerked up, !
carried north, and put down where the
rails could not bo found. i
Another great need of the army la light
draught steamboats for use on the many
rivers and lakes of Luzon. There is
hardly a place in the world where an
army coula use river steamers to greater
advantage. The Rio Grande, the Chico,
the Rio Grande Pampanga. the Agno, the
Blcol and the Paslg all flow through fer- j
tile and densely populated valleys and of- I
fer a means to the army of bringing up j
supplies and swiftly transporting large
dies of soldiers that would bo inval
uable were it utilized.
From what can be learned from the in- j
surgents they are well satisfied with the
present condition of affairs. Their Con
gress has just returned a communication
to the American Peace Commission, de
claring that, while they would have ac
cepted autonomy from our Government if
they had been properly dealt with at first,
they will now consider no proposition ex
cent independence. With almost 42,000 !
miles of territory from which to "draw
supplies, and with those coming In with- '
out opposition from Hongkong, Japan
and from Central and South America and
Australia, the insurgents are probably !
doing well as far as supplies are con- i
cerned.

THREATENED TO
KILL HIS WIFE
Serious Charge Against
G. J. Moore.
CONSTANTLY IN TROUBLE
SHOT HIS BROTHER HARRY
FIVE YEARS AGO.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA. Oct. 2S.â G. J. Moore, son
of the president of the Pacific Mutual Life
Insurance Company, is now in the County
Jail awaiting trial before City Recorder
Klamroth on a charge of threatening to
kill his young wife. Since arrival here
Moore has been pretty constantly before
the public. His first trouble occurred last
winter when he and his wife were resid
ing on Elmlra street. He was working
this territory under the employ of his
father. Next door lived another agent of
this same company. The two agents
quarreled over the agency of the territory.
For a long time they would not speak to
each other. Then one night Moore set a
trap for chicken thieves, he said, and
caught his neighbor's dog. The dog made
a great noise and awoke its owner, who
aroused the Marshal. The dog had to be
shot. v
Moore was arrested and tried for dis
turbing the peace. The other agent was
arrested on Moore's complaint and finally
matters were adjusted on an arrange
ment as to costs, Later Moore and the
other agent indulged in a fist fight. in the
Los Angeles office of the company. These
affairs caused a stir in the community,
and ihere grew up what was known as
the Elmira street teud, the families there
taking* sides with whichever party they
deemed in the right. Mr. and Mrs. Moore
finally removed to 131 Waverly drive. Sev
eral days ago they separated, Mrs. Moore !
foing to work for a doctor who lives on
lai e-j.fje: avenue.
Moore's drinking caused the trouble ln
the family. Thursday he went to Los
Angeles and came home drunk. He swote
he would "do up" somebody. He tried to
borrow a gun, and tried to hire one with
$1 he had. Palling to do so, he went to
see his wife, and, though without a
weapon, succeeded in so frightening her
that she rushed downtown with neither
hat nor shoes on and begged the Marshal
to save her. She had had to flee from her
husband. Marshal Lacey told Moore that
he could choose between going to Jail
and leaving town. A compromise was
effected, and Moore was placed on board
an electric car for Los Angeles. The next
day he came to town and made more
threats to kill. He was going to kill the
doctor kill his wife and kill the police
men. He was locked up and a charge was
filed against him. He begged not to be let
out of jail because, he said, he knew he
would kill the doctor.
George J. Moore is the son of George
>. Moore, president of the Pacific Mu
tual Life Insurance Company of this
city. Young Moore gained considerable
notoriety in August, 1894, by shooting his
brother Harry in front of the insurance
building at the corner of Montgomery
and Sacramento streets. They had a
brief altercation and Harry struck
George in the face and the latter drew a
revolver and shot him in the side just
above the hip. George coolly thrust the
pistol in his pocket and said lie had shot
his brother because the latter had threat
ened to thrash his father. George was
charged with assault to murder, but the
case never came to I rial, as his brother
recovered and refused to prosecute.
George returned to his position in his
father's oflice, and one day, in ls9T. he
went into a shooting gallery and shot
himself in the stomach. He recovered.
and his father then tried to set him up
in business in the southern part of the
State. He was made agent of the com
pany in Los Angeles and was finally
transferred to Pasadena, where the latest
trouble occurred. His friends in this city
say that he is quiet when sober, but when
in liquor he gets perfectly crazy. He is
ln tho habit of going on periodical sprees,
and when in that condition becomes vio
lent. He Is 2S years of. age. His first
wife died and he was divorced from his
second, but it is said that they had be
come reconciled and had resumed marital
relations.

The Poop Man's Friend.
It is a proud privilege to cast' my vote for Horace Davis. I have
known him for a great many years, and it was his substantial sympa-
thy for the needy that flrst won my regard for him. As the years
passed and I saw more and more of his generous deeds I came to rec-
ognize in him one "of nature's noblemen. Over thirty years ago I kept
a grocery store at the corner of Fremont and Folsom streets, where
want and sorrow abounded on every hand. Afterward I moved to the
corner of Clementina and Eckert streets, in both of which localities
the same conditions prevailed poverty and suffering. I bought my flour
of Horace Davis and in that way became acquainted with him. I knew
everybody in the neighborhood and his or her condition, and the ap-
peals to me for food were often greater than I could meet. On such
occasions I would take a list of suffering families to Horace Davis. His
first question would be, Are they really suffering? On my assuring him
they were, he would order his foreman, without waiting to investigate,
to deliver a sack of flour and a sack of oatmeal to each address I gave
him. "Let me know if you hear of any more such cases," he would say
to me; "but don't toll anybody about this." Not once but dozens of
times I have gone to Horace Davis on such a mission and he never

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LANGTRY. Texas, Oct. 2S.â Professor ;
j Robert T. Hill of the United States Geo- !
j logical Survey and party pulled out of the ]
j Rio Grande here last evening after a voy- j
age of over 500 miles through the wonder- j
! ful canyons of the stream between Pre
: sidio Del Norte and this place. The trip
i was one of unusual hardship and was
made in three boats. Every few miles the
boat had to be dragged over rapids and j
falls, and at "one place portage was made
over fallen rocks ISO feet high in the i
I Grand Canyon. Almost the entire dis- I
i tanee traversed was through canyons j
; with great vertical walls, and no less |
than fifteen canyons and mountain ranges |
were crossed.
The complete survey and meandering of
the river was obtained, together with over
200 photographic views of the magnificent I
scenery, which Professor Hill pronounces
to be unsurpassed in this country. Valua
ble results were secured concerning the
geological history and physical geogra
phy. Hardly a dozen persons were seen
along the route. The survey is untravers- \
able to man or beast in ail but a few i
places. Only the most fortunate combina
tion of circumstances made the trip possi
ble, and, notwithstanding the Important
scientific results, the whole party avowed
that all the money In the United States
treasury would not make them undertake
li 'again.
Professor Hill attributes the success of
the expedition to the herculean strength i
of his chief of party, Henry Ware of Col- I
orado. and the knowledge of James Mc- j
Mahan, an old trapper, who has hunted ,
beaver for many years along its course. I
Professor Hill and party discovered a
number of rich veins of gold and silver ]
along the canyon walls, and it is prob- I
able an effort will be made to develop j
these prospects by members of the party.
Evidences of the canyon formerly having .
been inhabited by cliff dwellers were dis-
covered. i
DEWEY A VERY STRONG
PRESIDENTIAL CHANCE
THE ADMIRAL WOULD BE THE
FIRST TO REFUSE OFFICE.
W. J. Arkell, Editor and Owner of
Judge, Speaks of the Possi
bilities of the Next Na
tional Election.
W. J. Arkell, owner and publisher of
Judge, arrived from New York and is now
at the Palace, accompanied by his
brother, Bartlett Arkell, formerly man
aging editor of Leslie's Weekly, and P.
W. Herbach, a millionaire business man
of Omaha.
Mr. Arkell's trip to the coast is taken
with the dual object of recreation and
to inspect some valuable mining property
in which he is heavily interested. The
property lies Just outside of Nevada City, I
and Mr. Arkell is now awaiting
the arrival of J. B. Wheeler, another
stockholder, in whose company he will
visit the mineral storehouse.
"What am I to talk about?" said he.
when seen in the rotunda of the Palace.
"At Denver a man met me and asked me
to give him an interview, telling how it
felt to be a funny man. Now, wouldn't
that Jar you? I toid him that being funny j
was a mighty serious business, but he
wouldn't have it "that way. Well, then !
I thought I would try to oblige him. I
told him one of my best stories. .He lis
tened politely until I had tinished and ,
then said he had to hurry away as he â 
had another engagement. He never came ,
back. I looked for the interview the next
day, but lt wasn't there. Then I inquired I
of another reporter, who did not know
who I was, about the one who had first!
seen me. The second fellow replied that j
the first one had tried to run a joke on !
his editor and the boss fired him. Rather
tough on one of us, don't you think?
"My brother has a plant for exhausting
the Air from glass jars and then filling i
the vacuum with meat. It's a great in- I
vention. The meat keeps forever, and you i
don't have to eat it if you don't want to. j
My brother has come out here to see a
gentleman in San Jose who is interested j
Fn the same business, and I thought I
would accompany him for a little rest and
Incidentally look into some Nevada City
mining property in which I am interested.
I expected to return on Monday next, but
will, I think, be kept here several days
over that time.
"As to the next President, I don't know
what to think. Bryan is stronger than
he ever was, but not strong enough to I
land the prize. Dewey, it is said, is not
out for trie office. But wait until he is
offered it. If he refuses he will be the
first man in history who ever did. He
would certainly win if he accepted. Roose
velt is a mighty strong man and a very
able and honest one as well. The time for
him has, however, not arrived yet Elec
tion after next will be when he will come
strongly to the front."
Killed by a Fall.
COLTON, Oct. 28.â A. N. Goudy arrived
here this afternoon with three carloads of
cattle from "Wilcox. Ariz., and was riding

NEW JINKS ROOM
DEDICATED WITH
GREAT CEREMONY
Bohemians Do Honor
to Their Owl.
â
Even the owl of Bohemia blinked its
: eves at the magnificent pageant which
pans-ed before its orbs last night within
I the walls of the famous club which takes j
! its name from the hooting bird. The new
| jinks room, which is located in the new
j building adjoining the club, was dedicated
i last night with all the pomp and cere-
I mony so dear to the hearts of true Bohe
j mians. In attendance at the ceremonies -
j were the members of the exclusive club
j and a score of honored guests. The order
â¢ of services was carried out to the letter j
j and proved highly interesting to those
fortunate enough to be present.
I The services were opened with a pro- i
i cession of "St. John of Nepomuc" and his
i retinue. All were in costume and pre-
I sented a brilliant spectacle. Vanderlynn ,
| Stow, president of the club, read a pre
l amble and then followed the "Tableau of
j the Owl." The bird of silence and of
! night was seen in all its majesty sur
| rounded by appropriate settings. The Bo
! bemian choir, composed of sweet male j
voices, sang an ode to the owl, and at its
I conclusion "Uncle" George T. Bromley,
high priest of Bohemia, delivered an in- |
vocation. The remarks of the venerable
! gentleman were enthusiastically received
! By the audience.
"W. H. 1.. Barnes followed with an inter
! esting paper on "Bohemia of the Past."
j An appropriate tableau was shown, and
then James D. Phelan read a paper on
"Bohemia of the Present." Another j
1 tableau was shown, and Donald de V. !
Graham's sweet voice was heard in the {
I following effusion:
Behold, they builded better than they knew,
The genial souls who raised Bohemia's shrine â 
! In olden days.
! Feace rest on us for aye within these walls;
i Within this little world of joy serene:
I This gentle land wherein no shadow falls!
1 Bohemia be as 'tis, as it has been!
' "Bohemia of the Future" was the title
; of a brilliant paper read by ex-President
'â . Horace Piatt. A tableau, showing what
was in store for Bohemia, was then pre-
sented and the choir rendered a triumphal
ode.
The curtain which was dropped on the
beautiful tableau was painted by John A.
Stanton, the famous artist, and presented
to the jinks room by President Stow. A
! picture called "The Spirit of Bohemia"
| was presented by Theodore Wores, who
j also arranged the tableaux of the cere
j monies. The music was specially com
] posed for the occasion by H. J. Stewart
to words written by Peter Robertson.
Brief addresses were delivered by Al
! exander H. Hawes, Dr. George Chlsmore,
; Benjamin R. Swan, James M. McDonald,
Albert Oerberding, William Sproule and
Joseph D. Redding. The latter is in New
York, but this did not prevent him from
' appearing before his clubmates in voice
and spirit as he sent a handsome phono-
graph with a record of a clever speech.
i the concluding words of which touched
its listeners. They were: "Here's to you
. âand each of you, good friendsâ all
: friends. From across 3000 miles of spac*
, the wireless telegraphy of my heart re
; sponds to every throb of yours."
Lantern slides of the following absent
presidents were shown and were warmly
received: Thomas Newcdmb. Harry Ed-
wards. Virgil Williams, Robert C. Rogers.
John H. Boalt, Alexander G. â Hawes, Paul
Neumann and Stuart Taylor. Concluding
remarks were mail" by James A. Thomp
! son, and then the members and their
; guests adjourned to the green room for
i supper.

STARR AGAIN HEARD FROM.
Still in Manila and Anxious to Get
Home.
PASADENA, Oct. 28.â Friends and rela
tives of Hilary Starr have again heard
from him. Starr is the man who myste
riously disappeared from Oak Knoll ranch
last spring, leaving every sign that he
had been killed and the body dragged
away. Later he wrote from Manila that
he was alive, had enlisted under some
other name while unbalanced in his mind
and wanted to get home.
His later letters maintain this story. He
asks if the men under his employ were all
paid off when he went. If so he lost only
$30 and a watch. He says letters have
been written to the War Department and
commanders at Manila, but nothing has
been heard from them yet.
Proof of Germany's Friendship.
BERLIN, Oct. 28.â Cabinet at a
meeting to-day decided to readmit th*
New York Life Insurance Company to
business in Pussia, the company having
agreed to work under the same conditions
as the German companies, dropping its
tontine features in Germany. This con
cession is regarded here as great proof of
the German Government's friendship for
the United States. The cases of the other
American companies are still pending.

MONTEREY, Oct. 28.â The heavy rains

Gentlemen Riders Contest for
Burlingame Cup at Oakland.
Burlingame Cup at Oakland
Monrovia a Surprise.
Monrovia a Surprise.
The Burlingame Club Cup, now a reg
ular fixture on the annual programme of I
the California Jockey Club, had its first
decision. at Oakland yesterday and was
captured by Monrovia, ridden ln faultless
fashion by Charley Dunphy of the broad
and expansive grin. The other entries
were: O'Connor, with Lieutenant Haines ]
up; Una Colorado, handled by Mr. Tobin;
Billy McCloskey, having Mr. Page ln the
saddle, and Rosalbra, steered by Peter
Martin. All of the gentlemen named are
members of the Burlingame Club, in ac
cordance with the -conditions of the race.
Great preparations were made for the af
fair, everywhere the colors of the swell
San Mateo organization being conspic
uous. The clubhouse was tastefully
draped with blue and red bunting and a
flag of the same combination was swung
to the breeze over the entrance. The
ultrafashionables of San Mateo, San
Francisco and Oakland society occupied
peats on the verandas and lawn and
cheered the riders as they issued from the
paddock. A handicap, Rosalbra, the
mount of Peter Martin, carried top
weight. O'Connor looked to "be in"
nicely, and, with Lieutenant Haines up,
ruled a hot favorite. Monrovia, carrying
152 pounds, was second choice, her odds
falling from threes to 13 to 5. After each
rider had finished his toilet the paddock
gong sounded them to the post. For this
one time Mr. Ferguson gave up the start
er's box to President Williams. In a false
breakaway Rosalbra carried Peter Martin
past the clubhouse before he was pulled
up, and Peter jogged his moun^ back.
looking tired but game. Lieutenant
Haines wore the same resdlute look he
carried with him through the Porto Rico
campaign and never flinched when O'Con
nor fretted and pawed the ground. Dick
Tobin appeared calm and serene, and
Charley Dunphy got in a final grin as the
flag fell to a pretty start, with Monrovia
first away. Even with his weird effect in
balloon trousering, Mr. Page lost the wind
at the turn, thereafter being compelled
to take the "wash" from the others, with
Billy McCloskey. Before half the mile
had been covered the lieutenant was in
danger. One of his patent safety stirrups
fell off. leaving him like a one-legged man
on the gridiron trying to kick a goal. It
was easy for Monrovia, which mare and
Mr. Dunphy won at leisure. O'Connor so
outclassed the others that he ran second.
two lengths in advance of Una Colorado,
with his rider holding the saddle with one
hand and endeavoring to urge his steed
With the other.
The victory was a very popular one and
as Mr. Dunphy, wearing the red, white
and blue colors of the winner's owner, A.
B. Spreckels. came back to the stand, he
received an ovation. After the rider had
dismounted and the saddle was removed
a handsome flora] horseshoe was placed
over the mare's neck by Mr. Williams.
ThÂ« balance of the sport was quite as
Interesting as the stellar attraction. The
favorites though all behaved somewhat
badly, Guilder, Faversham and Forte
meeting with defeat.
The first winner turned up in Merry
Boy, a 15 to 1 shot, with Henry in the sad
dle. The distance Was seven furlongs and
Guilder closed a sturdy 9 to 5 favorite.
He showed no speed, running unplaced.
Merry Boy came from fourth place In the
stretch, beating Jennie Reid out a couple
of lengths. Libertine, the second choice,
finished in the show.
Lavator was a good horse and no mis
take yesterday, placing the mile run to
his credit without any great effort. Four
to 1 was laid about him, 'and never
headed he downed Faversham, the favor
it-, five lengths in 1:41%.
Speedy May W fell in with easy game ln
the sprint over the Futurity course, third
to be decided, and at prohibitive odds
won as she liked. Skirmish, a War Dance
mar- from Idaho, made a creditable show
ing, leading out Zoroaster for the place.
Johnny Woods drew a very line finish
with Morlnel in the mile and a sixteenth
selling affair. Dozing away in fourth po.
Fition until a furlong from home he there
shook his mount up, winning by a nose
from Festoso. Forte, the even-money
favorite, displayed not an Inkling of speed,
landing at the wire absolutely last.
Dr. Rowell's Satsuma was ready-money
in the mile handicap. Closing favorite ln
the ring Jones on the bald-faced horse
hooked up with Morgan astride Rosor
monde in the stretch, and in a desperate
drive downed the mare a neck. To the
latter belonged the laurels, for she was
giving away too much weight and ran a
â¢superb race. Hohenzollern was a close
third.

The bettors who cast their fortunes in

and but small returns for their money.
It was a field day .for the short-enders,
the majority of the heavily bae.-ued dogs

queror, 1 to 6, and Maggie N beat Wild
Monarch, 1 to 10. This latter was a bye
course, Maggie N being substituted for
Irma, which was drawn.
The coursing throughout the day was
of an even character. The hares were not
so fleet of foot as they have been for
some weeks past, but were sufficiently
fast to test the speed and staying quali
ties of the dogs. A high-class lot of
youngsters went to the slips in the sap
ling stake. Four still remain and all are
the progeny of Emm Pasha. Three are
out of Wave and the other out of Bona.

SAN MATEO PARK.
The hares at San Mateo Coursing Park
showed greater familiarity with the es-
capes than on the opening day. Many of
them placed the stout board fence be
tween themselves and the dogs and live to
be coursed another day. The run down of
the open stake was disposed of. together
with two rounds of the puppy stake. One
of the surprises of the day was the defeat
of Crawford Lad by Black Bess. The
stake seems to lie between Whitehead and
Young America. They will meet in the
second round of the stake this afternoon.
Both ran well yesterday, and the ultimate
winner will be hard to pick until the flag
goes up.
The star feature of the card this after
noon will be the meeting of Curtis & Son's
Cash and X. P. Whiting's Mlneola. It will
be practically a match race and will de
cide first and second places in the Inaug
ural Stake, which was unfinished last Sun
day. The detailed results of yesterday's
running follow:
Puppy stake â George Watson's Moonstone
beat George Ehmann' a Target; Jeff Marte

FITZPATRICK
PITCHED IN
FINE STYLE
The "Fireman" Held the
'Crabs" Down to Two
Hits.
Hits.
Inability on the part of Santa Cruz to
connect with Fltzpatrick's shoots lost that
team the game played yesterday In i Rec
reation Park. The Beachcombers were
only able to hit safely on two occasions
and seven of their number fanned. The
visitors from the seashore deserve credit
for putting up an errorless game, but
without stick work games are net won.
The game was replete with double plays,
but nothing of a sensational nature hap
pened. Only one hour and thirty minutes
were consumed in playing the game, as
the men went out in quick order. "Jacl:"
Sheridan, the old-time umpire, officiated
with credit to himself and pleasure to
those who watched the exhibition. He
had but one close play to judge, but his
decision, to the surprise of the "fans,"
was not questioned. He will umpire again
to-day and it is hoped the California
League management will secure him for
all time. He has a loud voice, a dignified
presence and what he says goes.
.As usual Mr. Whaien, Santa Cruz's
pitcher, made himself unpopular -vith the
spectators. In the middle of the contest
he bunted the ball to short, but made no
effort to reach first, as he felt sure he
was out. This style of ball playing did
not meet with the approval of the crowd
and when he did the same trick in the
eighth inning he was roundly hissed. He
partially retrieved himself in the follow
ing inning, when a ball rolled close by
him, by making a dash for it and throw
ing it to first in time to head the runner
off. Following is the score:

Mr. John M. Wright, San Francisco,

Dear Sir: Inclosed find clipping of this
ino.*ning's Echo. You will see that this
report* takes In your land, and further
will say that they have got oil on N. W.
M of Sec. 4 and S. W. Vi of Sec. 32, and
that they are drilling on Sees. 30. 20 and
24, with good prospects. If you have not
made any arrangements In regard to
sinking a well I would be pleased to put
a machine on your land immediately. If
you do. not want the trouble of attending
to getting your pipe hauled, etc, I can
do that for you, as I can hire it done by
teamsters that are doing that kind of
work. I would rather not contract to
furnish the same. I will do your drilling
either for $25 per day or $1 50 per foot for
first hundred feet, with 25 cents added for
each 50 feet after. I will furnish my own
fuel and water. Tours, etc.,

THE united merchants and manufac
turers of the Paciflc Coast have re-
ceived their ultimatum from the
Southern Paciflc Company. The
corporation will stand by Its attorney.
General N. P. Chipman. J. C. Stubbs has
said to the executive committee of the
Paciflc Coast Jobbers' and Manufacturers'
Association that he would stand by Chip
man. On the other hand the merchants,
through their duly constituted repre
sentatives, have told Mr. Stubbs that they
will not forsake William R. Wheeler,
whom they have nominated to All the va
cancy ln the Interstate Commerce Com
mission. That is the interesting situa
tion that confronts the people of the Pa
ciflc Coast this morning.
The organization and functions of the
Interstate Commerce Commission throw
light upon the general proposition quite
effectively. The commission tries com
plaints against transportation lines. Mer
chants may become parties to a contro
versy before the commission, but It is by
intervention. The mercantile and manu
facturing community of the Pacific Coast
entered into the controversy at St. Louis
before the commission concerning graded
rates and differentials by intervention.
The suit was filed against the transconti
nental railroads. The great interest the
Pacific Coast has in the issue brought
about intervention on the part of the Pa
cific Coast jobbers and manufacturers.
The railroads are alleged to be the cul
prits and are the defendants.
With this clearly In mind the move of
the Southern Pacific, Company to put its
own attorney, General Chipman. in as a
member of the commission has signifi
cance which only the blind can fail to see
at once. It is simply a proposition of a
culprit to select Judge and jury In the
person of the culprit's attorney.
Some tacts have been learned concern
ing the conferences in the Southern Pacific
offices on Friday, of which conferences
there were two, that no attempt to con
ceal could successfully keep in the back
ground. The" first session on Friday
found the Southern Pacific Company rep
resented by H. E. Huntington alone. The
jobbers and manufacturers were repre
sented by the executive committee of the
Pacific Coast Association, and only onÂ©
or two of the members of the committee
residing in this city were absent. -Mr.
Huntington told the committee that he
did not know anything- about the candi
dacy of General Chipman and requested
ADVEBTISEMENTS.

A Certain Cure fop Piles*
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is a success be-
cause it has the merit which brings suc-
cess. It cures every form of piles and i
cures them to stay cured. It Is now the >
! most popular and best known pile remedy i
! before the public, and one reason for Its ]
j great popularity Is because it has taken j
I the place of surgical operations, once con- !
j sidered the only sure cure.
People often wonder that so simple a i
' remedy will. so promptly cure such an ob- j
i stinate trouble as piles are well known to
be. Tet the greatest remedies and great- ]
I est Inventions we have are the simplest,
j and the fact that it does cure is all the
i sufferer from piles wants to know.
The Pyramid Pile Cure cures piles in
! any stage of the disease as shown by the
I following testimonial letters which are
: published every week and new cases re-
ported each time:
From Geo. C. Gieck, Owens Mill, Mo.:
Some time ago' I bought" a package of
Pyramid Pile Cure for my wife who. had
suffered very much. The ' flrst trial did
her more good than anything she had ever
tried. It is just as represented.
From Richard Loan, Whipple, Ohio: I
have used the Pyramid and am entirely
pleased and satisfied with results. It does
the work and no mistake.
Mr. W. R. Hines of Magnolia, Ark.,
says: Although I have used the Pyra-
mid Pile Cure only a very short time, yet
it has been very beneficial to me.
From Mrs. Peter Lake, Mohawk, N. T. :
I received the Pyramid Pile Cure, but put
off using it until last week, when I be-
came so bad I decided. to try lt. I have
suffered twenty-nine years â  with bleeding
piles and have used a great deal of mcdi-
cine, but never had anything that did so
much for me as your remedy. '!.';
The proprietors of this remedy could
publish columns of similar letters to the
above if necessary, but these are enough
to show what it will do In different cases.
The Pyramid Pile Cure is prepared by
! the Pyramid Drug Co. of Marshall, Mich.,
and for sale by druggists everywhere at
60 cents per package. Ope package is suf-
ficient to cure any ordinary case. Your.
druggist will tell you more about it.

THE SA^i rBAyCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1899.
I that the committee should call again ln
I the afternoon when, he said, he hoped to
bave Mr. Stubbs present.
The committee again visited the yellow
; building and met Mr. Huntington and Mr.
1 Stubbs. It consisted of the following:
j Wakefield Baker, president of the Pacific
Coast Jobbers and Manufacturers' Asso
ciation; E. R. I.ilienthal, H. D. Loveland.
traffic manager of the Paciflc Coast Job
bers and Manufacturers' Association; Ed
ward Pond, E. Everett. Charles F. Tay,
j L. Guggenhelmer, I. F. Llttlefield, Charles
Holbrook. Arthur Towne and Frank L.
Brown of the American Steel and Wire
I Company.
It did not take long to reach an under-
standing; also an agreement to disagree.
Mr. Stubbs did not plead ignorance of the
candidacy of General Chipman. On the
contrary he openly said: "Chipman is my
; candidate; not the candidate of the South
! em Pacific Company."
I This proposition did not deceive any one.
I because it was known that the petition
in favor of Chipman was circulated in this
city by R. B. Carpenter, an attorney for
j the railroad company, and that it " was
i promoted in Sacramento by D. O. Mills.
i The difference between Stubbs' candidate
I and the Southern Pacific candidate, under
these circumstances, would not be evident
I to a mind sufficiently acute to fathom the
difference between tweedle-dum and
j tweedle-dee. In fact, there was and is no
! difference. Chipman stands forth clearly
as the Southern Pacific representative.
The representatives of.the Paciflc Coast
Jobbers' and Manufacturers' Association
told Mr. Huntington and Mr. Stubbs,
plainly, that they would stand solidly be
: hind Mr. Wheeler, and that the entire
l business interests of the Pacific Coast was
j pledged to him. Something being said
j about the necessity for a lawyer as a
' member of the Interstate Commerce Com
; mission, the fact was presented to Mr.
| Stubbs' attention that one of the most
I eminent attorneys in San Francisco, after
i reading carefully and studiously the argu
i ment made by W. R. Wheeler at St. Paul,
' had declared that the author of that argu
ment had a fine legal and judicial mind.
1 The discussion lasted some time, but did
â  not move Mr. Stubbs or the committee.
Mr. Huntington and Mr. Stubbs wer*
; given to understand clearly that the
} business men would act as a unit. Some
wholesome truths were uttered concerning
the position in which the Southern Pa-
I cific Company had placed itself in refer-
I ence to the CommisÃionership, and the
: gentlemen parted. There were no high
| words, nor was. there any appearance ot
i much excitement; but the railroad people
, and the committee fully understood that
j there could be no agreement on a can
| didate. The railroad might talk about
1 harmony, but it was well understood that
it was not possible.
That this marks the opening of a fight
.to a finish over the Commisslonership
i there is not a shadow of . doubt. 'the
l merchants and manufacturers do not
I want Chipman. One of the oldest, most
conservative and successful business men
In the city was heard to say that he
would prefer that the Pacific Coast should
not have the Commisslonership rather than
not have the Commisslonership rather
than it should go to an attorney of the
j Southern Paciflc Company. Throughout
I the commercial community there is the
j feeling that to name a railroad attorney
I for the place belittles the commission.
Yesterday additional support was given
|to Mr. Wheeler. The Grocers' Alliance
of California, numbering 1500 members,
i sent notice of the adoption of a resolu
tion by the alliance requesting the Presi
j dent to appoint a Paciflc Coast man to
i fill the vacancy upon the Interstate Com
i merce Commission and unanimously rec-
I ommending the appointment of Mr.
| Wheeler. The resolutions were signed by
I John A. Stulz, president, and John M.
| Sullivan, secretary. Tacoma and Seattle
i have wired that they will follow the lead
of California. Now all eyes are turnea
to the California Congressional delegation.
No California Congressman will be able
to say that he did not know what the
wishes of the business men of the coast
were. A circular letter has been sent to
every member of the delegation, the body
of which, clearly setting forth the mat
ter, is as follows:
In addressing the following request to you,
permit us to state first, that ln the creation
of the Interstate Commerce Commission, con-
sisting of five members, the intention of the
act was that one member should be chosen
from each geographical subdivision of our
countryâ the New England States, the Eastern
or Middle States, the Middle Western States,
the Southern States and the Paciflc Coast and
Mountain States.
This is as it should be, ln order that that
body should be composed of men familiar with
the conditions obtaining in each section.
The coast has thus far . not been honored
in the makeup of this commission, pos
sibly owing id our claims not having
been , properly urged. The business men
of the entire coast, from Seattle to San
Diego, are now alive to the propriety of push
ing their claims that a Pacific Coast man. thor
oughly familiar with matters pertaining to
railroads ln general and freight transportation
in particular, be named by the President to
fill the existing vacancy. Such a man they
have united upon unanimously and with one
accord. knowing his superior fitness for the
position. This man is William H. Wheeler,
of* Holbrook, Merrill & Stetson, San Francisco,
Sacramento ami Los Angeles.
Mr. Wheeler did not put himself forward as
â¢a candidate for this place, but has been asked
to take the position, and is now Indorsed by
every Board of Trade, chamber of Commerce
and other trade organizations in California,
Oregon and Washington.
This the Paciflc Coast Jobbers' and Manu
facturers' Association, Just organized, and com
prising a membership of nearly large busi
ness houses and manufacturing concerns located
in the three States named, with headquarters
in this city, earnestly requests your Indorse
ment and active support ot our candidate. Mr.
Wheeler.
We understand from the mercantile interests
of Oregon and Washington thai their respective*
Congressional delegations will act in harmony
with you in this matter.
We want representation on this commission;
we are a unit for Mr. Wheeler, and respectfully
request you to wire President McKinley urging
his early appointment. Please favor us with
an early reply.
No- answers had been received last
night. The letter was signed by
Wakefield Baker as president. The fol
lowing telegram was forwarded to the
members of the .Congressional delegations
of Pacific Coast States other than Cali
fornia:
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 23, 1899.
The Paciflc Coast Jobbers' and Manufacturers'
Association, three hundred strong*, covering all
coast cities from Seattle to San Diego, in ses
sion here yesterday, unanimously indorsed Wil
liam R. Wheeler of San Francisco, a prominent
Paciflc Coast business man, with large knowl
edge of railroad matters as their candidate for
vacancy on Interstate Commerce Commission
They ask your co-operation with coast Con
gressional delegations in obtaining this recog
nition, and believe the large territory west of
Rockies is entitled to this representation
WAKEFIELD BAKER, President.
THOMAS P. SMITH, Secretary.
The Portland Oregonian concerning the
action of the Chamber of Commerce of
Portland rays: "Mr. Wheeler seems to be
entirely satisfactory to Portland. A few
days ago the Chamber of Commerce sent
word to commercial organizations in Pa
cific Coast cities that It would support tbe
NEW PASTOR TO DIRECT
CENTENARY M. E. CHURCH
REV. J. E. MOORE OF VIRGINIA.
\ candidate of the Jobbers' and Manufac
turers' Association."
The following was sent by the Portland
Chamber of Commerce to Senators Simon
and MeÃride and Representatives Moody
and Tongue: "The manufacturers, joo-
bers and citizens of the Pacific Coast have
long felt the imperative necessity of hav
ing one member of the Interstate Com
merce Commission from the Paciflc Coast.
As a vacancy now exists in this commis
! sion an effort Is , being made to secure
i from the business men the nomination of
S a candidate who shall merit the united
: support of the united Congressional dele
gations of the coast States. At a meet-
ing of the Pacific Coast Jobbers' and Man
ufacturers' Association the name of Wil
liam R. Wheeler, a member of the firm
of Holbrook, Merrill & Stetson of San
Francisco and chairman of the traiflc
I committee of the Pacific Coast Metal and
| Hardware Association, was unanimously
' agreed upon. In line with the above we
I respectfully ask our delegation to prompt
j ly investigate the claims of the candidate
named and, if possible, to unite with us
, and the Congressional delegations of the
Paciflc Coast States in his indorsement
to the President."
Frank li. Brown of the Pacific works of
the American Steel and Wire Company

WINS THE
FIGHT WITH
HIS FEET
French Pugilist Knocks Out
an Englishman by Kick-
ing Him.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
PARIS. -Oct. 2s.â The fight for .25,000
francs between Charlemont, France's
champion, and "Jerry" Driscoll, former
champion. of the British navy, this after
noon, resulted In a victory for the former.
There was a great crowd and the fighting
was hot for six rounds. In the seventh
round Driscoll was knocked out by a
smashing kick In the groin, the French
man being allowed to use his feet, in ac
cordance with the French custom. The
seats sold as high as $40 each. '^WWt'Zy
The Englishmen and several Frenchmen
protested against the decision being given
in favor of Charlemont, but the majority
greeted the announcement with wild
shouts of triumph and cries of "Fashoda."
The Englishmen who witnessed the fight
declare- that it was most grotesquely un
fair from beginning to end. The umpires
were both. Frenchmen and' one of them
actually was Charlemont's father. The
match was supposed to be under the
Queensbury rules and "kicking In the
groin" was barred.
The ring was I five * and; a half yards
square. The contest consisted of two
minute rounds, with intervals of one min
ute and ten seconds.
Charlemont was heavy, and fat. Drisclll
was light and sinewy. i Charlemont wore
walking shoes and five-ounce gloves were
used. The Frenchman was no match for
Driscoll, who pounded his opponent's face
to a jelly and finally got him In chancery,
but. he Immediately released him, crying
out "He has bitten my lip." Driscoll,
however, tackled him again, whereupon
the crowd jerred and hooted him, nobody
.knew why. -â¢"<->*:â¢'
- Driscoll, hearing some one shout
"Time," stopped and the uproar Increased.
One of the umpires threatened to with
draw, whereupon a Frenchman in the
crowd arose and said he would act as um
pire. .This. led to a discussion lasting four
minutes, giving, Charlemont, who was
groggy, time to recover for the second
round, / during which Charlemont was
again punished and the round was stopped
before time had expired, Charlemont being
out of breath.
Rowdy disputes lasted during the Inter

ACADEMIC LEAGUE RACE.
Polytechnic School Wins. the Twenty-
Five Mile Relay.
The team of the Polytechnic High
School of this city won the fourth annual
twenty-five mile relay race of the Aca
demic Athletic League yesterday morning
at San Leandro, Davidson, who rode the
last relay for the Polytechnics, finishing
four minutes ahead. of the next nearest
man. Miller of the Lowell School.
The timing of the different relays was
very. poorly managed, owing to the Inex
perience of the officials chosen to act, so
that a schedule of the performances of
the various men was not obtainable. Of
the six schools entered, but five started,
being the Polytechnics and Lowell of this
city, San Jose High School and Central of
Oakland, and the California School of Me
chanical Arts. The Berkeleys did not
! show up.
The finish was not at all theatrical, Da
vidson riding in with plenty of time to
spare. The Lowell School finished second,
j San Joses third and Central fourth. The
Californias came In too late to be scored.
The usual number of spills incident to
I a road race occurred, hut no one was
i badly injured. The day was an ideal one
for road racing, and presages well for the
Associated Clubs' ten mile handicap to-
I day.
This race gives the Polytechnic School
its first hold on the valuable trophy the
Academic League offered. It having been
won in previous events by the Central,
Lowell and Berkeley Schools.
The net riding time of the teams was as
follows: . ; vr;
Polytechnic, 1:16:45: Lowell. 1:20:47; San
Jose, 1:23:47; Central, 1:28. The Lowells.
although second, had no chance after the
first relay, as Solinsky, their rider on the
first, dropped the packet, and the next
man had to pick it up and bring it in.
The Bay, City Wheelmen held a recep
tion and smoker at their club house Fri
day evening in honor of Arthur F. Lund
berg, one of the members who recently re
turned from Manila with the California
regiment. They also presented Mr. Lund
berg with a handsome watch fob. The
presentation was made by Judge Kerri

as he could, though somewhat surprised

proved a most enjoyable one.

STORMY CAPE
Effort to Be Made in a
Thirty-Foot Sloop.
Thirty-Foot Sloop.
â â¦
A daring attempt to circumnavigate the i
globe in a 30-foot sloop la to be made by
Captain C. Baettge of this port. Several
men in small craft have successfully
made the voyage, but Baettge is forced
by the terms of his agreement to go
around the Horn to New York and thence
to Europe. He cannot go through the
Straits of Magellan, but must actually .
round the Horn ln his 30-foot boat, taking
his chances with the terrible weather that ,
prevails off the cape of storms.
Captain Baettge was born and brought
up on a ship and he has been afloat ln
every kind of craft from a dingey to a
man-of-war. He has been shipwrecked,
lost overboard, marooned on a desert
island, but never suffered serious injury
until I.e. broke his arm and collar-bone
on his sloop while repairing her on thÂ©
Oakland mud flats.
Th. sloop that Captain Baettge Is going â 
to circumnavigate the ..rid ln Is well
known on the Bay of San Francisco as I
the Mabel. She is a ter board boat,
drawing three feet six inches of water. I
The rboard is of steel and weighs
3*6 pounds. With it down the boat draws
ten feet of water and the captain says
that no gale that ever blew could cap
size her. in December of last year Cap
tan Baettge ana Captain iÂ»wbe-g were
out In the Mabel when it was blowing 100
miles an hour. They had a terrible time
of it, but the boat weathered tte storm
and came Into port after everybody had
[given them up for lost. Since then the ,
venturesome skipper has* been caught in
a number of gales, but in every case got
off with a ducking. Now he intends to go
home via i ape Horn and put the weath
erly qualities of his boat to the severest
kind of test.
X.. March next Captain Baettge will be
72 years old. He is a giant in stature ana j
has never known bat it is to be sic.
His seventy-third birthday he says he will
spend with his relatives in Holstein, Ger
many, and will have Been all the ports on
the Pacific and Atlantic coasts- of Amer

"I am never happy away from the sea."
said Captain Baettge yesterday. "I was
born on it and it' the fates so will I wou.d

kind to me and cradled me like a mother.
It is only when 1 am ashore that any

To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: From

Foote and his conduct and management
of our interests ln the Garcelon or Merritt
litigation.
It is doubtless unnecessary, but under
the circumstance lt surely is not improper
for us to say that during that period we
were men of adult years, not children;
that we were fully advised by Mr. F.xite
Of all that was under consideration; that
we understood to the minutest detail the
terms and conditions of the compromise
agreement which avoided the necessity of
litigation; that we knew before the settle
ment the compensation which he was to
receive and which was well earned; and,
finally, that now after the lapse of Dearly
nine years. since the settlement we have,
as we have always had. nothing but a
feeling of the warmest gratitude and
friendship for Mr. Foote for the ability as
well as for the loyalty and fidelity to our
interests with which he conducted our af
fairs and concluded the business.
It should he needless to add that this is
given to the public without any knowledge

LATEST WINE
DEAL BREAKS
ALL RECORDS
Three Million Gallons
Involved.
During the last three weeks there has
I been more activity in the wine business
i than for many years and shippers and
' cellar men have been working night and
day. The deal that started matters go
â  ing was the purchase by the principal deal
| ers of three million gallons of merchant
! able wine from the California Wine-
makers' Corporation. This sale grew out
of the fact that the corporation *found it
necessary to go out of business owing to
the refusal of the producers to sign new
contracts tc sell wine to the corporation
for the next five years.
On top of this deal came the announce
ment of the Southern Pacific Company
that the rate on wines in wood -ould be
advanced from 45 to 75 cents per hundred
pounds to principal Eastern points. In
order to save this difference in freight
the Eastern buyers and the merchants of
this State became decidedly active and
the result was that ln the short space of
three weeks there was shipped from Cali
fornia the enormous quantity of three
million gallons of the juice of the grape.
In other words about a thousand car-
loads of wine have been sent to the
thirsty Easterners ln that period, and if
all those cars were put in one train they
I would cover between seven and eight
miles of track.
The best feature of the situation is the
I fact that this product of the vineyards
: brought good prices and put hundreds of
thousands of dollars of extra money in
circulation In this State.
The wine that was purchased from the
Wine-makers' Corporation went into
strong hands and the consequence ls that
prices are high and steadily advancing.
At the same time the coopers have been
and are enjoying all kinds of prosperity
and wine men are experiencing .-Teat dif
ficulty* in obtaining necessary cooperage.
| Jobbers say that the outlook for the in
dustry is remarkaby encouraging and that
1 their future prosperity seems to be as

Seek Shelter.
There ls attached to the Good Samari
i tan Church on Second street an institu
tion in which well behaved men can find
a superior home for a less amount of
money than at any of the many lodging
houses in th*/ city, In addition to this
the home has been prepared especially for
the reception of boys who have arrived
at the age of 14 and over and who huve
been inmates of orphan asylums. In this
home the boys are taken and provided
with superior board and lodging for a
limited proportion of tneir earnings.
Boys taken into the Armitage Home
from the orphanages are generally pro
> vided with employment in some of the
various branches of industries in this city,
and In order to preserve them from the
! many evil Influences besetting the path
way of the young when thrown in con
i tact with men and boys who have not re
ceived a moral training the home on Sec
ond street is guarded by all of the moral
i Influences of a well regulated home.
The church of the Good Samaritan, as
conducted by Rev. W. I. Kip, on the south
of the slot, has, been so productive of
good that the idea occurred to him to add
to its usefulness by renting the large
three-story building on the corner of Sec
ond and Folsom streets as a home for the
overflow of the orphanages of this city
and suburbs. Into this the boys from the
Armitage were removed last July to tho
number of â¢ twenty-five and placed under
the supervision of Superintendent J. C.
Astrado and his wife, who acts as matron
jof the home. The whole institution 19
under a board of directors composed of
Rev. W. I. Kip, Rev. John ; Emery and
Major W. B. Hooper, with an auxiliary
board of ladles consisting of Mrs. A. N.
Drown, Mrs. George H. Buckingham, Mrs.
A. M. Lawler, Mrs. R. B. Sanchez, Mrs.
George H. Baker, Miss Alice Garber,
Mrs. G. H. Kellogg, Mrs. Dr. G. B. Buck-
nail, Mrs. Henry Euler, Mrs. George Reed
and Mrs. D. L. Kelly. The home has ac-
commodation for over one hundred boys,
ln addition to about thirty men, who are
already snugly housed in the comfortable

Western Addition Club.
An adjourned meeting of the Western
Addition Improvement Club was held last
night at Franklin Hall on Fillmore street.
The club supported the proposed issue
of bonds for improvements, including the
erection of the new Lowell High School,
new hospital and the extension of the
park panhandle. Dr. Charles V. Cross,
the active and energetic president, re
signed, much to the regret of the club
members. He stated that having been
burned out he was forced to locate in the
Columbia building and consequently
would be unable to remain as president,
but would at all times aid the club in se
curing for the Western Addition such
necessary improvements as its residents
needed.

country except cotton, which will remain
at the rate to which it has heretofore
been subjected. â¢ *â  '-- . % ,.-,â  *> .*â .-.. â  ;

SOMETHING NEW IN OIL.
The Petroleum Center Oil Company,
with offices third floor, Mills building,
room 29, has made a radical departure
from the methods adopted .by most oil
companies. Heretofore it has been the
custom to sell -stock to obtain money to
look for oil, but this company first found
their oil by sinking test wells and proving
their lands to be In the true oil belt, thus
removing their shares from the domain of
wildcat speculation. Such companies are
a welcome addition to the oil Interests of
the State and help to establish the indus
try on a firm basis. It Is predicted for
them success, as they have sunk three
test wells and struck oil at a depth of 102
feet, striking the same heavy deposit as
found ln the famous Elwood well. â¢

Stanford 6, California 0.
f^rqHE ball isn't over," shouted a Cal
ifornia freshman with a coating of
blue and gold colors.
J^ "It's a touchdown," yelled his
'**' Stanford antagonist.
The referee sided with the latter, and
now the freshmen of the Palo Alto Uni
versity are three shades more joyous than
their crimson colors; the Californians are
blue without the goid relief.
Stanford won the game by a single
touchdown secured after the hardest kind
of a plugging line flght not more than five
roinut-ss before the game ended. Every
California student inside the grounds said
that the touchdown was not made, but
counterbalancing this purely *|ne-sided
asseveration was an equally positive as
sertion from the Stanford contingent that
the goal had been reached by the red
shirt-ed colts. It took the referee five
minutes to clear the crowd oft the field,
for the youngsters in their wild and un
restrained enthusiasm broke â  all bounds
ar.d rushed upon the gridiron. He came
lo the conclusion that the touchdown was
a reality, and so the .Stanford freshmen
won the game.
It was a hard-won victory and brought
out a gritty defense from the Califor
nians. One foot from the goal line Stan
ford tried to force victory through Cali
fornia's line. The. cardinal colts, still in
the gristle of athletic manhood, hurled
themselves against their opponents, but
no gain resulted. A second time they
tried. Roberts had the ball. 11. *â¢ was
partially over the line, but liko a locomo
tive, end on, the entire California team
caught him in the middle and he went
down to earth with his face toward his
own goal. Another fierce rush followed,
but tbe California line did not waver.
Vi'ben the twenty-two football players
were untied Smith of Stanford was found
hugging the ball on the lime line that
ei.ds the gridiron. Victory was won, but
the spectators were not apprised of it un
til some minutes later, and then the car

Cornell 5, Princeton O.
ITHACA, N. V., Oct. 28.â 1n one of the
finest football battles that Cornell has
ever waged against an opposing eleven
she wrested victory from Princeton on
Percy Field to-day by a score of 5 to 0.
Through the two 20-minute halves, which
were repeatedly interrupted by various
players succumbing to the strain of the
fierce work, the teams struggled, with the
odds slightly in favor of Cornell. Prince
ton was outplayed, both in defensive and
offensive work, and as the game pro
gressed Cornell seemed to let out a great
reserve force, which was productive of
telling work. In punting, which was re
sorted to freely by both elevens. Captain
Starbu>ck held out well, and toward the
latter part of the contest he was out
punting Wheeler. In catching punts for
runs or kicking Walbridge and Young ex
celled and seldom lost even a yard on a
fumble. Princeton, on the contrary, was
weak in this respect.
The great feature of the game was
Toung's goal from the field, which won
the contest for Cornell. It was made in
the last few minutes of play, just at the
time when it looked as if the game would
be a tie. The attendance was 8000. Line

dinal banners fluttered in the wind and
the Stanford band played something in

This season's freshmen football contest
was the most Interesting played since
their inception. The long stand on the
west end of tne Sixteenth and Folsom
street grounds was packed with col
legians and lovers of the gridiron game.
On the south end of the stand Califor
nia's adherents, beribboned with blue and
gold, kept up an Incessant shouting of all
cries peculiarly Californian. The blue and
gold band was there also and loaned Its
quota of noise. Divided by a line Stan
ford's supporters, all in red and led by
their own band, produced just as much
racket and Indulged in an equal variety
of ululations. The crowd was by far the
largest seen at a freshman game, and it
Was also the noisiest.

Lick School Defeated the Tar
n Team by a Large
Score.
The game at San Rafael yesterday be
tween the Lick and Tamalpais teams re
sulted in a victory for the Lick team, the
final score being 17 to 0. This is the
largest score that has been made against
Tamalpais this season. Lick has a very
strong team and is likely to give Belmont
a very close rub for the Academic trophy.
| For Tamalpais Captain Bair, Templeton
! and Sheehy played good ball. Minor,
j while he lasted, was very strong on the
I line. He retired at the end of the first
half on account of a badly bruised shoul- ;
' der.
The Lick team played an excellent
game. Its fine teamwork resulted in
steady gains. Kaeding was the star for
Lick, making two of the three touch- j
; downs. Kelsey played an able second,
making splendid gains by his long punts,
one of wnich covered fifty-five yards.
The Lick line was very strong, standing
like a wall against the masses on tackle
that Tamalpais hurled against it. Lick
has a great pair of tackles and the ends â
Moss and Edwardsâ played excellent ball, !
getting down on Kelsey's long punts very
rapidly. The line-up was as follows:

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Chicago 5, Pennsylvania 5.
CHICAGO, Oct. 28.â football eleven
' of the University of Pennsylvania barely
â¢ escaped defeat at the hands of the Uni
! versity of Chicago eleven in a game in
which more desperate playing has sel
dom been seen. The final score was a
'â  tie, both sides scoring a touchdown ln
i the second half, and neither kicklns- a
goal. Total, 5 to 5. Better football, so far
, as clean, .snappy playing ls concerned, has
been seen in the two or three* games here
this season, but for sheer gameness, for
rallies when to yield the least bit would
result in a touchdown and for situations
: tending to produce heart disease, the
game was certainly remarkable.
Five times the Chicago elevent had op-
portunities to scoreâ twice by place kick
i ing with the ball in a favorable position
'. and three times getting the pigskin inside
, of Pennsylvania's 6-yard line. But only
once were the Maroons able to get the
; ball over the goal line and that was done
i when it Eeemed almost a certainty.
Through poor generalship on the part
j of Captain Kennedy of Chicago in at
tempting to send Slaker through Perm-
sylvania left guard he lost the ball for
Chicago on downs when It was within two
yards of the goal line In the second half,
â  and when, finally, a few moments later
Wellington was pushed over for the tie
; ing touchdown, the Chicago captain
missed an easy goal.
It was his attempt at a fake kick, too,
that ultimately resulted in Pennsylvania's
score, Kennedy dropping the ball when
tackled and Pennsylvania securing it on
Chicago's 48-yard line. With Chicago's
! goal line ln sight Pennsylvania's big
guards tore the Maroon line to pieces and
Davidson was finally pushed over. But
Chicago's goal line was not again in
â  danger.
Early in the first half Chicago discov
-1 ered that Pennsylvania's left end was
| weak and time and time again Hamlll and
I Wellington got around for substantial
: gains. But with the ball within a --ard
! of the goal line Pennsylvania made* the
most desperate stand of the game. Three
| times the line held, and when the mass
i of players untangled after the last down
j the ball was still a foot from the line.
Coombs an instant later punted out of
danger, and when time was called the
ball was on Chicago's 45-yard line.
Chicago's all around playing Was supe
rior to that of the Quakers. The latter
were utterly unable to get around the
Maroons' end, and In the first half were
frequently held for down even when using
the dreaded guards' back play, which has
brought victory to the, red and blue in
i many games. In the second half, how
| ever, the awful hammering told severely
| in the Chicago forwards, and during the
second series of plays which resulted In
I Pennsylvania's touchdown they â¢ were
I played off their feet. Most of the time
I during, the second half the ball was well
within Pennsylvania's territory, and only
â  the fiercest kind of playing. by the well
I nigh exhausted Quakers saved them from
defeat.
Notwithstanding the fact that rain had
been falling steadily since morning, the
gridiron at Marshall field was In fair con
dition. â¢ Frequent applications of sawdust
in the California line, advancing just
enough distance to retain possession of
thÂ© ball. Through the tackles and the
center came the cardinal chargers. Cham
berlain on the side lines was feeling very
happy, but not so with Cochran and
Kelly. Yard by yard the blue and gold
colts receded toward their own goal.
Stanford had struck its winning pace and
with slow persistence . every minute
brought the team nearer the coveted goal.
To the California thirty-yard line the red
shirts advanced and then the accident
happened. It came in the shape of a fum
ble, and when the pile of squirming ath
letes was disentangled a California athlete
was nestling the pigskin.
Loud was the cheering and the braying
of brass instruments from the blue and
gold section. ZjyXyZ22_:^-yi..-._y- .-a;
Fearful to attempt offensive play within
the reach of his own goal Valentine punt
ed the pigskin to the Stanford forty-yard
kept the field from becoming soft. A
crowd of fully 6000 enthusiasts witnessed
the struggle, Including several hundred

of the Centerville High School lined up
against the Berkeley High School this

sense a match for its opponents. From
the start the game proved one-sided.
Centerville played with a snap and pre

could do nothing. Three times during the
flrst half did the ball go over the line

line. Again the ball became red and the
cardinal host renewed the onslaught
against the California line. The tackles
were hammered as if an anvil chorus
were at work for a prize. The center was
smashed and the ends were circled.
Nearer and nearer came the cardinal front
to the California goal and noisier and
noisier became the Stanford contingent
on the bleachers. But this time it was
not an accident that stopped the Stan
ford advance. On the thirty-yard line the
California freshmen gummed their line
and stuck fast. Thf Ice they, were assailed
by the Stanford backs and thrice did they
beat back the attack. It was the flrst
time that California's defense proved
operative and successful.
Then the fortunes of war changed. A
long punt by Valentine and a fumble by
a redshlrt gave California the pigskin
at the center of the field. Another punt
followed and when Stanford regained pos

CARLISLE
Indians Succeed in Scoring
Ten Points Against
the Crimson
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Harvard 22, Carlisle 10.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 28.â While
Harvard had no difficulty in disposing of
the famous Carlisle Indian eleven this
afternoon on Soldiers' field, the crimson
players were unable to keep little Hud
son from kicking his customary goal from
the field, and a wretched muff by Girasch
early in the game, followed by a quick
pickup by Red Water, who ran fifty yards
for a touchdown, gave the visitors five
more points, making the final score 22
to 10. '.-.'?'.;
There was bad fumbling by the Harvard
backs at times and during the latter part
of the game the Indians, discovering a
weak spot in the crimson line, hammered
there for steady gains until the thirty
yard line was reached. After two downs
without result Hudson drove the ball be
tween the goal posts.
The little Indian quarter-back, however,
did not have all the kicking honors to
himself, for Burnett made a fine goal trom
a place kick on the Indians' fifty-yard line
and Hallowell's punting was almost as
gcod as Haughton's last year.
The entire Harvard eleven played with
a snap and dash that carried the 12,000
people almost off their feet with enthusi
asm. "'''t^M^WifyWiw^raiTl
Scarcely a Harvard man was injured
during the entire game. On the other hand
a' number of the Indians were sadly bat
tered. Wheelock was carried from the
field and to-nigh Is still. in a serious con
dition. His injuries apparently resulted
from a blow about the head.
Until the last part of the second half
Harvard's new defense worked well and
had no trouble in keeping the ball in the
Indians' territory. As the Harvard score
mounted, however, Captain Burden deter
mined to give the substitutes a chance.
Accordingly he called in Eaton and Swain
as tackles, and also a new trio of backs-
Parker, Warren and Reid. Then the In
dians began to play. They attacked Har
vard's line with a. fury that the substi
tutes could not meet and slowly pushed
the ball down the field. A mass play just
outside of tackle was the effective for
mation and Swain especially seemed pow
erless to stop it.
On. every exchange of punts Harvard
gained, partly due to the great superior
ity of Hallowell over Miller and to tne
brilliant work of Daly, who Invariably
ran Miller's punts back ten yards before
being downed. The line-up:

At the beginning of the game. Stanford
money went a-begging, but the. ardent
enthusiasts found time during the rest to
place a few stray bets. California hoped
for a tie; Stanford for almost .nythlng
in the way of score. "If that red-shirted
captain would only play faster ball,"
said a shouter on the side lines, "we
would win in a walk." But the captain
of the Stanford freshmen continued his
painfull}- slow game and wasted precious
moments by lingering over the signals,
almost losing the game on account of it.
Roberts started the ball rolling in the
second half. An interchange of punts, a
fumble by Roberts and California was in
possession of the ball on the Stanford 40-

the night of the Green-Neal contest.

yard line. Then Valentine punted Boms
more and the pigskin went sailing over
Stanford's goal line. It was brought out
to the 25-yard line and punted bach into
California's territory. For the next ten
minutes the play was of the open order
nothing but punts and punts and punts,
from one side to the other. The ball was
a pendulum, ever in the air. Suddenly
Valentine's long, hard drives were trans
formed into high, short-distanced kicks
and Stanford obtained the pigskin on Cal
ifornia's 30-yard line.
"Now is the time to score," came from
the leathern-throated yellers on the Stan
ford section. Captain Raitt took the tip
and so did his team. But thirty yards
separated them from a touchdown and
visions of victory flitted before their
eyes. Smash, bang the cardinal went into
the blue and gold, and a trail of supine
players marked off the distance gained.
Right up to the goal line went the un
checked, plunging redshirts. One foot
away, yet it seemed a mile to Stanford.
for they could not make the distance in
the flrst or second attempt. If the third
trial proved fruitless the ball would go
to California. The third trial brought
success, however, and the game was won
by three-eighths of an inch, for that is
all the bail was over the middle of the
California goal line.
When the decision was announced red
flags were at a premium and much stri
dent noise floated over, the field. The goal
was kicked and the score readâ Stanford
6, California 0. But four minutes of play
remained and nothing on which a score

Game of Football on

NEW YORK, Oct. 28.â At Manhattan
Field to-day, in a game that was fiercely
contested throughout, the football eleven
of Columbia defeated that of Yale by a
score of sto 0. In addition to this, Colum
bia carried the ball across Yale's line two
more times in the same half, neither of
which was allowed as a score because of
some technicality. The referee classed
the latter play as a touchback and gave
Yale a full kick from her twenty-five yard
line. This was of no avail, however, as
Weeks carried the ball over again for a
touchdown on the first line-up after this
kick. It was a beautiful run of about
forty-five yards, in which Weeks dodged
several of the Yale players, including
Captain MeÃride, and carried the ball
squarely between the goal posts. Wilson
made a poor try at an easy goal and the
score was: Columbia 5, Yale 0 Thus

Home Gatherings.
Mr. and Mrs. Samuel. Hamilton of King
City on the Ilth fhst. had the pleasure
of celebrating an anniversary that but
few have, and that was the fiftieth anni
versary of their wedded life. The cele
bration was tho more enjoyable from the
fact that there were present at the re-
union a number of the relatives of the
celebrants. The event took place ln the
residence of J. E. Steinbeck ln Paso Ro-
bles, which for the occasion had been
prettily decorated. All wished the aged
couple who have bo long harmoniously
sailed together adown the stream of life
another quarter century of companion-
ship, so that they may celebrate the dia
mond anniversary of their wedding. Those
who were present to congratulate the
guests of honor, Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton,
were Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Martin of San
Francisco. Mr. and Mrs. J. P. Farrell of
Los Angeles, Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Hamil-
ton of Salinas, Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Ham-
ilton of Paso Robles, Mr. and Mrs. J. E.
Steinbeck of Paso Robles, Miss Dessl
Hamilton of Salinas, Thomas Hamilton
of King City and J. R. Hamilton of Stan-
ford. After congratulations all partook of
an excellent golden wedding dinner, and
*4he recollections of the pleasant event will
long linger ln the memory of each who
was at that reunion. Half a century ago
Mr. Hamilton was a resident of the city
of New .York, and while there married
Miss Elizabeth Fagan. At that time the
discovery of gold was attracting the at-
tention of the world and Mr. Hamilton,
catching the "gold fever," left his wife
with her parents and came to the Golden
West around the Horn, landing in San
Francisco In 1851. He endured the changes
and hardships of the early days of Cali
fornia and after a time was rejoined by
his wife. About ten years ago they se
lected King City &s their home. Mr.
and Mrs. Hamilton are the parents of
eight living children.

ETTA BUTTLER
APPLAUDED BT
HER ADMIRERS
Scores a Great Hit in
New York.
An example of the rapidity of acquiring
celebrity is the instantaneous success of
Etta Buttler at Koster & Bial's, New
York, recently. A great many people
shrug their shoulders when a certain act
in a variety programme is favorably com
mented upon, and yet the variety stage
of to-day offers as great attractions in the
musical and dramatic line as we find upon
the concert and dramatic stage at times.
Thus when It is known that Etta Buttler
achieved fame at Koster & Bial's, the
leading vaudeville house in America, it
means -considerable, and that she is par
ticularly advertised by the house aner
her first appearance means a great deal
more than any one may Imagine, for it is
rarely that domestic talent receives recog
nition at this place.
Miss Buttler will be remembered her*
well by those who frequent amateur en
tertainments. She was always clever ln
dramatic declamation and showed a par
ticular ent for imitating great actresses
or singers. Her first appearance ln the
professional field was with a comic opera
company in Oakland, where she played
ln "La Mascotte." Her special hit in New
York was an exceedingly clever imitation
of Modjeska and May Irwin. Her success
was so great that she was immediately

Another San Franciscan who has
achieved fame lately in a greater sphere
is Miss Rose Relda, or better known here
as Miss Rose Adler. Her voice has found
so many admirers In Paris, where she
studied, that she has been engaged tor
the Opera Comique for one year. This is
a very great distinction, especially when
one considers that Miss Adler did not have
much professional experience, as far as
the stage was concerned, lt is a most
flattering acknowledgment of her facil
ity.

DOINGS OF DOG OWNERS,
The Pacific Bull-terrier Club officials
have Issued a book containing Its consti
tution and standard of points.
John E. de Ruyter, chairman of the
Pacific Coast special committee of the
American Kennel Club, has gone to New
York, where he will confer with the of
ficials of the American Kennel Club on
matters affecting the Interests of dog
owners on this coast.
George Bell, who judged at the San
Francisco Bench Show of, 1898, has been
winning laurels at the late Toronto show,
despite the fact that distemper had lately
been on the rampage ln his kennels. Mr.
Bell took the flrst limit ln the fox-terrier
dogs and third ln the open class, his dog
being beaten by the English crack. Claude
Duval, and by the "American crack, Vic
toria.
Mrs. J. L. Marks has acquired from J.
P. Norman the enormous fawn mastiff
Major, which took . first honors in 1895
and 1808. . Mrs. Marks has applied for
membership in the Pacific Mastiff Club
and is already training Major, who has
not been in good condition lately, for. the
next show.
There is a scheme afoot among some of
the prominent fanciers to form an asso
ciation for the purpose of organizing a
large kennel on co-operative principles for
members' dogs. George Bell has been
suggested as a suitable manager. An of
fer has been made him, but as yet his re
ply has not been received. Among the
members of the organization are: H. H.
Carlton. D. S. Murray, J. P. Norman, C.
Bull, M. Bruin, J. Langen, Eugene

A GREAT FRATERNAL
ENTERTAINMENT
ANNIVERSAY CELEBRATION OF
THE WORKMEN ORDER.
Thousands Turned Away From Odd
Fellows' Hall for Want of Room
to Accommodate Them.
Of the 11.000 people who received Invita
tions to be present in Odd Fellows' Hall
at the celebration of the thirty-first anni
versary of the organization of the Ancient
Order of United Workmen last Friday
more than 9000 accepted, but owing to the
smallnees of the hall more than 6000 were
unable to gain admission. The seating
capacity of the hall was occupied to its
limit and the side aisles were crowded by
men and women who stood during the en-
tire literary and musical programme.
The hall was very prettily decorated
with red and blue bunting, relieved with
many banners bearing the letters A. O.
U. W. and with American flags. Over the
platform there was a very large banner
fringed with silver bullion, having upon
its face the emblem of the orderâ the an-
chor symbolizing hope and the shield sym
bolic of protection. The stage was occu
pied by Grand Master Workman J. M.
Collins; C. E. Snook, grand foreman;
Frank M. Poland, grand recorder; Samuel
i Booth, grand treasurer; Dr. J. L. Mayon,
j grand medical examiner; Edwin Dan-
I lorth, deputy grand master; William H.
! Barnes, past grand master workman, and
David S. Hirshberg, past grand recorder.
i The vast audience was called to order by
the grand master, who In a few words
explained the purpose of the meeting and
then introduced William J. Hynes, who
for a quarter of an hour, amused the au
dience with songs and humorous stories.
Past Grand Master Barnes then spoke
for some time on "Protection, as Offered
by the Ancient Order of United Work
men," and by facts and figures made clear
how the order, in the past thirty-one years,
had given protection to the beneficiaries of
more than 44,500 members, who in that
time had joined the silent majoritY, and
that in extending that protection to
widows, orphans or blood relatives of
those deceased members the living mem
bers had contributed the enormous sum
of J59.000.000. the contributions being in
small monthly assessments by each, and
explained that It is the duty of all young
men with families to protect their homes,
I for unless they do so widows and orphans
may come to want.
"Better Than Gold," was sung by
Mrs. Walter Malloy. Then came a
tenor solo by W. J. O'Brien; a cake-
walk by Master Arthur Parent and
Miss Bessie Shean; soprano solo, Miss
Edna Camp; an address on "Fraternity
As Exemplified by the Ancient Order
United Workmen," by Past Grand Re-
corder David S. Hirshberg, who in a logi-
c al and most eloquent manner showed
the fraternity that exists In the order and
' that is the foundation stone of its stand
ing and success. Miss Lottie read. "The
Innocent Drummer"; Professor E. A.
Wolff favored with an Instrumental solo,
and the A. O. U. W. quartet, D. M. Law
rence, Fletcher Tilton, C. L. Gage and C.
, L. Parent, rendered A. O. U. W. songs and
choruses. The programme closed with a
: humorous song by Samuel Booth, the
: grand .receiver. Dancing followed until
; 1 a. m. This eventâ the most successful
: ever given under the auspices of a fra
ternal beneficiary organization In this
cityâ was under the direction of the fol
! lowing named: Entertainment Committee

* an Alameda bride. Only hie Bemu of patriotic duty prevented him from re- Â£
f turning with the Kansas regiment and sharing in the honors accorded him. I
| Lieutenant Arthur Ferguson, who figures in the dispatches, should by this â¦
A time nave been wedded to Miss Annie Chrlatenaen, one of the most beauti- â¦
4 ful young ladies of Alameda. **â ?
â¦ Yesterday's dispatches from Manila spoko of the bravery of Lieutenant %
. Ferguson, who, with twenty scouts of the Thirty-sixth Regiment, recon- Â«
4 loitering near La bao. encountered a party of mounted Filipinos. The en- <*
A gagement ended by the killing of clx of the enemy and the capturing of â¦
â¦ eight. although there wero but ten rifles In Ferguson's command. %
â * Instead of returning in the middle of the fighting in the Philippines *
â¦ young Ferguson accepted a commission for two years in the regular arm-.-, â¦
4 and it is not at all unlikely that the lad who went as a private and Is now "a "*
X lieutenant may own a higher commission before ho returns. When the South I
â¦ Dakota regiment returned they were full of praise for the brave work of T
<s Scout Ferguson. Tliey told how, when the Kansas regiment came to that <*>
* river at Calumplt, they found the bridge nearly destroyed and that it was â¦
I almost sure death to venture upon it. All the roadway had been torn up T
Â» and nothing: remained of the superstructure except a few narrow iron beams, f
<*> I'pon the farther side of the river the Filipinos were concealed and occupied X
| â¦ such a strong position they could easily sweep the bridge of anybody who â¦
' | might be upon it. The enemy, however, did not anticipate the tactics ol 4>
,1 Ferguson. Stripping himself that his motions might be unimpeded and that â¼
â¦ he might have some chance of escape by swimming should he fall into the J
â â -â  river, Ferguson took a rope and crawl* " carefully out upon the Bide of the 1
J bridge farthest from the Filipinos. His progress was shew but he managed I
â¦ i{Â° set J?cro?3 and escape the notice of the enemy, even after he reached the Â£
i land. By means of this rope he was able to help his comrades over the rive-,- t
I tury, )'*ing a raft which he pull-ed over. This story differs somewhat from f !
* the dispatches sent out regarding the event, .but the South Dakota*, who 1 :
I W"P; *>'Â«TwitnÂ«Â«Â»". to the occurrence, declare that Ferguson performed the X
J most daring feat of the Filipino war. â Â£â¢
Lieutenant Ferguson has had other narrow escapes and in one of his le'- *
X ters he refers to a bullet that scratched the side of his cheek and to another t
<* that went through his canteen at Calumplt. Ho remarked that In cither X

â * some very lively fighting this winter and predicts that by spring the war ' f

SAFE LIKELY TO

Oakland Offlce, San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 28.
A four-thousand-pound safe threatens
the life of Officers Phillips and Swain at
the City Prison. Auditor Breed, in his de-
sire to look well after the archives of his
office, has purchased an enormous safe,
j and this afternoon the bulky affair was
j landed In the City Hall. It is likely at \
any time tee fall through the floor, several !
expert reports tiled during the past few '
I years stating that the City Hall cannot j
with safety hold such a piece of furniture.
The Auditor's office is in one of the old- |
' est corners of the City Hall, and is right i
i over the corner of the jail where Officers
Swain and Phillips keep their night watch. ,
ami occasionally, when duties are >ot â 
I pressing, -taking a few winks. The hall '
j has been condemned for years, and its '
; rotten condition la given as the only ex-
cuse why the- city treasury has b<>en â 
: forced to keep so much money in the local
i banks, because the hall would not support I
a vault. Prisoners have found it so easy
! to knock down the walls that they have
frequently done so and walked out.
This condition of danger exists every-
where, and when it was known this after-
noon that Mr. Breed had decided to install
his safe, the jailers went at. once to con
i suit with the City Attorney regarding the
â  issuance of an injunction restraining Mr.
Breed from endangering the lives of the
prisoners and the jailers, lieing Saturday
' afternoon, the City Attorney was out anil
the safe was installed. When the im- ;
j mense weight was placed on the joists. '
: the celling below cracked, and nobody will
j In' surprised to find some morning the j
; Auditor's safe in the basement, with one ',
or two officers or prisoners beneath it

IN SUNSET DISTRICT.
The Sunset District Republican Club
held a grand rally last night at their
headquarters, Park View Hall, corner of
Ninth avenue and H street.
Horace Davis was the first speaker of
the evening. The audience applauded his
remarks liberally, and at the end of his |
speech three rousing cheers were given
the Republican candidate. He said in
substance: "The new charter has vested '
in the next Mayor very great powerâ in I
fact, it makes him all-powerful. A selfish
man with such power can further his own i
Interests to a great extent, and could
easily pave his way to the United Stales
Senate. The people in the past have seen
fit to bestow great honors upon me; they
have trusted me and placed confidence in ;
me. 1 think that I have served them
faithfully; I know that I have done my
best, and feel proud of my record. That
I have not abused my trust goes without i
Baying, for as yet my opponents have said
naught against my record. If I am elect
ed to the oTfice of Mayor I will do all In
my power to place San Francisco where
she rightly deserves to beâ close ts the
head of the list of the most important
cities of the world.
"I am in favor of new schools and a
perfect sewer system and of any improve
ments which will help our city. Channel
street in its present condition is what no
other city in the world would tolerate.
"I feel that the entire Republican ticket
is gaining strength daily And it behooves
us to put our shoulders to the wheel and
work hard. The Republicans have given
the voters of San Francisco a good ticket,
of which the party can well feel proud,
and it will stand favorable comparison
with that of our opponents. Mv experi
ence with educational institutions will
serve me well in the selection of a good '
Board of Education. I have always been
in favor of good schools and I believe that
the young of our city should have every
chance to flt themselves for * proper start
in life. Again I ask you to keep working
and on the Sth day of November our
party will give the people of San Fran
cisco a great surprise."
Charles H. Jackson, in a short speech
asked for the support of the ticket. Will
iam A. Deane, Charles Boxton, Dr. T. H.
Morris, i.. G. Carpenter, Major Kyle and
William Watson also delivered short ;
speeches.

City, Oct. 28, 1899. 614 Bush street.
This Is to certify: L *
" That for the past twenty-five years I had used opium or morphine and for
a year cocaine also.
Mv health was almost ruined, my stomach and heart both being badly af-
fected. I could work but little and was in distress most of the thne.
I had tried several cures and to reduce myself, but all failed to cure. In
August last I read an advertisement of a cure where the fee could be paid
after the cure was made, and no pain or suffering, and also that it cured in
three or four days.
1 talked with a few people and some said It could not be done.
In one large drug store they laughed at me for trying it. But on October
14 I went to the sanitarium and started in. for I knew that It must be right
or the Doctor would not wait for his fee like that.
Within forty-eight hours from the first dose of medicine I was cured of
all my drug habits and cigarettes as well, and just as the Doctor told me. I
bad no pain or Buffering and the desire for the drugs or for liquor or any
stimulants was and ls all gone.
Mv stomach and heart and other troubles have left me and I am gaining
In flesh and strength every day. It is just two weeks to-day since I started
with the cure and money would not. tempt me to go back where I was then.

NOE VALLEY MEETING.
Democrats of the Thirty-sixth Assem
bly District held a meeting last night at
Twin Peaks Hall, corner of Noe and Sev
enteenth streets. E. B. Carr, as chair
man of the meeting, introduced Mayor
Phelan as the first speaker of the even
ing. The Democratic candidate was well
received and applause frequently inter
rupted his remarks. Among other things
he said:
"l have during this campaign given
this city a very thorough canvass and l
feel confident that the people of this city
will elect the entire Democratic ticket on
next election day. The people are satis
fled that we are on the verge of a new
era. We have had for the first time a
clean, satisfactory primary and the char
ter is no longer in doubt. San Francisco
has jumped rapidly to the front In the
past few years and nothing should be
done to retard her progress. We want
the new administration started in the
proper wav and want proper experienced
men to guide lt. National issues should
cut no figure in this municipal campaign,
and voters should select the best men.
Irrespective of party, to govern our city
at this important time. The records .if
the nominees who are seeking re-election
will stand for themselves. Dodge and
Lane are men of whom the Democratic
party ought to feel proud. Our city is In
need* of many Improvementsâ new schools,
a good sewer system and new hospitals.
The Democratic party has nominated a
good ticket and it is assured that if elect
ed the city will be run on a business plan
and work its way forward as one of the
foremost commercial cities of the world."
Dr. Washington Dodge told his hearers
that he had saved the poor people with
small homes unnecessary taxes and made
City Hall employes pay poll taxes, a thing
heretofore unheard of.
Resolutions were adopted denouncing
the actions of some Democrats in the
Thirty-sixth District in indorsing Albert
Heyef for Assessor and W. Z. Tiffany for
Recorder.

MRS. DR. CLARK,
THE WELL-KNOWN TRANCE MEDIUM,
206 Turk st., near Jones.
ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?
Bad health, business worry, family difficulties,
legal complications, or under evil influences?
j Mrs. Clark will help you. She deals with life
: and its practical bearing*, and many are they
i who rise to call her name "Messed.'* Her
! snonnous and varied experience for years of
study and travel, and. above all. her marvelous
i power of knowing all things at a glance, make
I lier advice invaluable. The moat complicated
! diseases, business entanglement or domestic
diflicultv is instantly perceived and the remedy
suggested. There is no case too difficult for
I her to handle, as thousands can testify.
Life in all its phases aha has made her one
' study. The cause of failure, the road to suc-
[ cess, denominate conditions, and rise above all
evils of whatsoever kind she has mastered. Nee
, man or w..man need remain under the cloud.
There is always a way out. She will discover it
and help you.
READ HER CIRCULAR,
Sent free on application with 2-cent stamp,
1 and learn more about the laws of life and her
own peculiar and wonderful powers than you
| have ever known.
SHE GIVES ADVICE ON BUSINESS,
I speculation, stocks. Investments, law, etc. She
! will tell you what trade, business or profession
, you are adapted for. Tells you when and whom
i you will marry and how to make It a peaceable
j and happy union. Has your lover deceived you?
jOr are you in trouble? You can be aided and
I all can be made right. Family love, and. in
; fact, all domestic troubles of public or private
i nature, can be made right and kept right after
a visit to this inspired medium of modern
I times.
Removes evil Influences. She never falls to
l unite the separated by proper advice.
I LEARN THE SECRET POWER OF CON-
TROL.
i Have you ever noticed how some people are
j lucky, happy and prosperous in life, while
others merely ex.-- an.l are just as miserably
unhappy? Why Is this*." Can you answer? Ask
her and she will tell you why. Mrs. Clark has
I devoted ten years of her life to the study of
; clairvoyance.
Mrs. Clark has been located In this city for
| several years, and la not Compelled to seek
other, localities.

TO STAY.

! tent, and you will depait thoroughly satisfied

viction will be sure, and happiness and success
will follow.

yet more than half of you are fighting against
un unknown fate or fame, fortune and position
I which you do not and cannot obtain until you
i find your true vocation.
If you are contented with your present work
I you have found your true vocation, and success
' will attend you, but if dissatisfied and all la
; going against you it is an evidence that you

, tant question, and your true vocation be point-
ed out to you; and If possessed of only a mod-
; crate degree of energy and brains success will
; be sure to attend you. She advises you with a
' certainty by a higher than human power as to
j the proper course to pursue In life. Her de-
i scriptions of your friends and enemies are as
i real as though they stood before you. Call and

WEATHER FORECAST FOR NOVEMBER.
Continued From Page 19
erly winds: An elongated trough of low bar
ometer (pressure 29.60 inches) lies to the
southward of the Aleutian Islands. Around
this area the circulation of the winds is cy
clonic, or against the sun. The two circula
tions, cyclonic (around the low) and anti-cy
clonic (around the high), thus unite in giving
rise to a belt of westerly winds extending
from 50 decrees north to 33 degrees north. The
average strength of these winds will show a
marked Increase over October. They will be
subject to frequent interruptions by the tem
i porary wind systems proper to the eastward-
moving areas of high or low barometer de
scribed below. Calms and variable winds will
occur throughout a belt extending from 25 to
40 degrees north, 145 to 175 degree* west.
The northeast monsoonâ The winter area of
high pressure central over Continental Asia
is now well established, and the anti-cyclonic
circulation to which this area gives rise covers
the China and the Celebes seas, the Philippine
Islands and the eastern coast of Asia as far
north as Shanghai, with the northeast (win
ter) monsoon. Beyond this point the prevail-
ing direction of the wind will be north to
northwest. In the vicinity of the mainland the
monsoon exhibits a marked tendency to follow
the trend of the coast. Here lt also weakens
slightly by night and at the same time blows
somewhat off shore, often permitting a vessel
close under the land to make way northward
against it. The monsoon brings thick weather
and rain along a weather shore. A rising bar
ometer foreruns an Increase ln strength; a fall
ing barometer a decrease.
Cyclonic and anti-cyclonic circulationsâTem
porary areas of alternately high and low bar
ometer will be found moving in a general east-
erly direction across the ocean. Around the
areas of high barometer the winds circulate In
the same direction as the hands of a watch
(anti-cyclonic); around the area of low baro
meter in the opposite direction (cyclonic). In
advance of an anti-cyclonic area, or high, the
weather Is dry (shown by the large difference
between the wet and the dry bulb; the baro
meter rises; the thermometer .falls; the clouds
(cirrus, cirro-cumulus, alto-cumulus) tend to
dissolve, and the general direction of the
winds is polar or westerly. In advance of a
cyclonic area, or low, the weather ls damp
(shown by the small difference between the
wet and the dry bulb; the barometer falls; the
thermometer rises; the clouds (cirro-stratus,
alto-stratus, nimbus) tend to gather, and the
general direction of the winds is equatorial
or easterly. The eastward passage of an anti-
cyclone Is marked by light winds and fair
weather; of a cyclone, by gales, rain and foul
weather. The path of the center of the latter
is generally confined to the region between 35
degrees north and 50 degrees north. Their oc
currence increases in frequency as the season
advances. Out of 2333 wind observations dur
ing November within the belt 35 to 60 degrees
north and 125 west to 145 east 47 per cent gave
a foroe of 5 or over (Beaufort scale); 30 per
cent a force of 6 or over; as compared with
24 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, for
October.
Typhoonsâ The probability of the occurrence
of typhoons ls much diminished, the average
for the month being two. The region through-
ut which these storms occur and the tracks
followed by the several classes are shown
elsewhere upon the chart.
Fogâ Fog and heary mist will _Â» met along
the American coast, also along the trans
pacific routes north of the 45th parallel but
with less frequency than during October.

I Oats and Hay.
The circular of George Morrow ft Co. aaya:
OATSâ Receipts for the week, 27,920 ctls. A
goodly supply, truly, and yet the market is
tirm, and for most varieties quotably higher
than at the close of lost week. Reds and
Blacks, which were formerly in demand for
:Â»Â»-d purposes only, are now commanding bet
ter figures for seed, and consumers are thus
: creed to fall back upon damaged Oregon Oats.
â "he demand for milling Oats Is also excep
tionally good at present. Undamaged Oregon
Oats re naturally very scarce and all offer
ings df such command fancy figures; prices
.ewhat above market quotations. So long
js Barley Ids firm there is not much danger
!ot any slump ln the price of feed Oats.
HATâ Receipts for the week. 3184 tons. All
things considered receipts have been unusually
light. On Monday last there were nineteen
rg yee of wet and damaged Hay In, but since
then, the volume of receipts has been. light,
especially for sound Hay. As a result the mar
ket ls In much better shape than lt has been
ar.d ls quotably higher. For some little time
to come we think it la apt to remain so. Every
thing, of course, depends upon the receipts,
but we cannot imagine people eager to take
their Hay out of the warehouses until much
better inducements are offered.
Aifalfa has arrived freely, but almost every
cargo haa~bÂ«en" more or less damaged, and the .
market for this particular class of Hay ls i
dearie rallied In consequence.
Dried Fruit in New York.
Mall advices from New Tork say:
"Trade has been generally good, but orders
are h!> -:',;. for small lots. Buyers are taking
only what are needed for Immediate consump
tion. Spot supplies of all goods are short, ex-
eept Prunes, and trade- Is confined almost
wholly to new goods for forward or Immediate
consumption. There is very little speculative
Interest, and trade ls practically all for con-
sumptive purposes. Peaches may be the ex-
ception to this statement, but to what extent
'.i is at present impossible to say.
"Prunes are firmer, and In some sizes there
has been an Increase ln price lately. The
season for the Prune trade Is here, and pres
ent Indications point to a lively run of busi
ness up to the holidays, and prices promise
to be above the usual range. There is a
considerable quantity of old Prunes left In
the market, but apparently that Is having no
Influence on prices for new crop goods. Buy-
ers find great difficulty In filling orders for
the four sizes, 90s are so scarce. There are
some 60s here, but they are closely controlled,
and holders refuse to make concessions. A few
onJera are being placed for the four sizes, but
the range la relatively higher than it would
be otherwise.
"Peaches Are ln demand, and the price holds
firm. Under present conditions the outlook
favors still higher prioes, with prospect of
early exhaustion for aome grades, or rather,
the creation of an artificial shortage by with-
drawing stocks from the market for specu
lative purposes. There is an advancing tend-
ency, but so far there haa been no Increase
for some days.
"Aprioota are still finn and tending upward
In second hand. There are none now in first
hands, and nearly all have gone from second
hands Into consumptive channels. Prices will
rule high during the remainder of the season,
and may advance further before the holiday
trade closes.
"Raisins are Ann, but distributive trade ta
rather quiet for California loose Muscatels.
Foreign gooda unchanged and prices tending
upward rather than downward."

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. Oct. 28.â The favorable showing
made by the bank statement was a complete
surprise to Wall street and venturesome bears
were caught short. The result was seen ln
some violent price changes. The expectation
of an unfavorable statement was so universal
that the bears were very active In the first
hour and the. bulls were little disposed to push
their ventures. ".' X '
The early advance on buying by London and
a light demand from outsiders through com
mission houses was completely wiped out and
the Industrial specialties yielded early ln aym-
I pathy with the weakness manifest in Steel and
c Wire, which dropped to 4Â£& on continued liqui
-1 dation and uncovering of stop-loss orders.
â  Pretty much all the stocks of companies in
; the metal industry were specially vulnerable
* and there was profit-taking In the leather
stocks. The latter were supported by the re
; cently active pool and prices bid up sharply.
This prompted some covering by the bears in
i other Industrials before the appearance of the
bank statement. But the scramble for stocks
; Immediately upon the publication of the state-
ment showed that large bear contracts re
: mained uncovered. The bulls helped on the
1 advance and bid prices up easily and by wide
jumps In the effort to take the market away
from the bears. The closing was feverish but
strong, and showed a higher level of prices on
the day. The Southern. and Southwestern rail-
road stocks made the best showing, as on pre
; vious days of the week. The bank statement
Is completely mystifying. A loss in cash by
the banks was taken for granted. None of the
preliminary estimates placed it under $2,000,000
I and most of them put It at over $3,000,000. In
, stead lt is $87,000. The increased activity in
the stock market indicated that the process of
â¢ loan contraction has been stopped. - Instead
there is a loan decrease of $4,766,900. Bear
traders were confident that cash In the banks
j would fall below the legal reserve require
; ments. Instead the 'surplus is more than
double, by reason of the reduction in require-
ments by loan contraction. No satisfactory ex-
planation Is available of the surprising recuper-
I ation effected by the banks during the week.
Dealings In stocks have been on a greatly
; Increased scale during the week, the total -sales
| running to near the three-quarters of a million
i shares mark on several days against a prevail-
ing dally average for some time past of less
! than half a million. The market has broad
' ened, the active list being more than doubled
ln length and many obscure stock coming for
: ward Into activity at advancing prices.
The disposition has been to advance, the op-
posing factors being the stiffness of the money
market and the weakness, of some of the
"green" Industrials with no dividend record
yet made. ;t
The growth of a new demand for stocks dur-
ing the week has been availed of to take prof-
its by those who have been picking up stocks
during the recent depression and money strin
gency.
The advance In prices since the first week in
October, when the lowest prices were made by
the liquidation forced by the wholesale calling
of loans, has been from 5 to 10 points in the
majority of prominent railroad stocks. The
profit has been sufficiently attractive to have
Induced some extensive realizing.
The' effect of this grew more marked as the
week progressed and the threat of an unfavor-
able bank statement undermined the confidence
of buyers. The most influential factor in the
week's advance was the announced determina
tion of the railroads to advance their rates for
transportation. This action promises very sub-
stantial benefits directly to stockholders in
railroad companies, as the traffic of railroads
has grown to such enormous proportions that
* a very slight change in the rate per ton for
freight would make a vast Increase in the ag
[ gregate return to the railroads. But the mci
dent has been significant ln its wider bearings.
( Competition for railroad business has been so
keen In the last few years that no cut rates
have been too severe for railroad managers to
! make In order .to secure business. The - ad
j vance in railroad freight rates is evidence that
the traffic has reached such proportions that
there Is enough to keep "the compenngr,*llnes
all profitably employed. It Is conclusive con-
firmation of the significance of tntelligeni.-e re-
ceived from all quarters of the country of con-
gested freight, freight car famine and eager
demand for new railroad equipment. The an-
nouncement of the New York Central's Inten
tion to devote the proceeds of Its new stock
issue of $15,000,000 to acquiring urgently needed
new equipment attracted additional attention
to the subject. Another Incident having far-
reaching influence on sentiment was the an-
nouncement of the closing of contracts by the
i great railroad companies for steel rails next
year to the extent of 1,500,000 tons previous to
the advance in the price. Several of the larg
est railroad companies have delayed these con-
tracts apparently \*.th the hope that the prices
of iron products would relax. The decision to
accept the present level of prices for so vast
a quantity of product by authorities whose op-
portunities for information is far reaching and
whose trained Judgment in large affairs is so
skillful goes far to strengthen the general faith
In an extension of the period of prosperity.
The large orders placed by railroads all over
I the country for new freight cars tend to the
same conviction. The future demand thus as-
sured tended to counteract the theory that Iron
prices would react with those of copper, tin,
lead and other metals.
The multiplying evidences of unprecedented
activity and prosperity ln business have
caused some relaxation of pressure against
even the "green" industrials, which have been
much In disfavor on account of the disclosures
regarding the capitalization and method of
valuation of constituent companies. There
have been conspicuous examples of price col-
lapse In this class during the week, but In-
siders have showed more Inclination to sup-
port the securities than in other recent in-
stances of a similar kind. Money has become
easier at Interior points during the week, and
the pressure upon New Y"rk has somewhat re-
laxed, but has not ceased. Rates for money
in New York have consequently been very
firm on account of the already depleted condi
tion of bank reserves. The firmness of for-
eign exchange. In spite of the stiffness of
money here and Its relaxation In London, cou-
pled with the fact that foreign houses have
been large lenders of money at the stock ex-
change, suggests that the return of securities
for foreign holders has been on a large scale,
although there was no evidence of such trans
fer through the usual commission house chan
nels. The easy conditions In the London mon
ey market have detracted from the Influence
of the war In South Africa on the stock mar-
ket. The market for railroad bonds has been
active and broad through the week and prices
are higher. United States new 4s and old .4s
coupon advanced "-i * and do registered, the 3s
and Ea coupon % In the bid price. The 6s reg-
istered declined Vi.

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW TORK, Oct. 25.-The statement of the I
Associated Banks of New York for the week j
ending October 28 was unexpectedly favorable I
in its showing. Predictions based on known !
movements of money had been that the banks |
would show a loss of something like $2,000,000
cash. Instead of this the decrease was lens
than $100,000, and as deposits contracted M -
740.200, lessening the reserve requirements
$1,685,150, the surplus cash In banks was
swelled to $3,038,523. This amount, small as It
seems in comparison with the usual excess. Is
still the largest reported since the opening of
September. To what extent the statement re
flects the actual condition of the banks can
not be determined. Certainly the known move
ment of money ever the past six days has not
been in favor of New York either on treasury
or on Interior account, and the sudden rise in
call loans on Friday does not seem consistent
under the circumstances. The interior is still
drawing or. this center and the banks have lost
to the treasury. The hanks, however, while
they are stronger In reserve than at the close
of the previous week, have- recouped at the
expense of outstanding ..' commitments, loans
having been contracted $4,776,900. This process
has been followed now with but brief Intermis
sion for a period extending back to July, and
the shrinkage from the high point of the year
is no less than $98,000,000. On July 8, when
loans and deposits were at a maximum, the
excess reserve was only $5,000,000. How the
continuous drain In cash 'since that time has
been met is easily perceived. The continuance
of this manner of meeting an extraordinary
demand is probably nearlng an end. for the
normal season for a return flow of money is
at hand. If the bank averages are correct, the
crop demand Is over, but there is nothing more
substantial on which to base a statement, and
this demand has ended. The truth of the mat
ter Is that conditions this year are so widely
different from those of former seasons that
previous experience cannot be used as a guide.
Trie interior banks are unusually strong' in
cash, and while New York Is the loaning cen
ter the supplies of money for the purpose are
forthcoming on demand from sections which
up to this year "have not entered Into competi
tion with the New York Institutions. While
New York shows an unparalleled falling off In
loans,- official national bank figures prove that
the volume of loans the country over ls larger
than ever.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Oct. 23.â Trading ln -wheat com-
I menced at a slight decline and there was so
little energy in the business that the market
sagged steadily throughout the session. The
i news was generally of a bearish cast, but sell-
I ing on any extensive scale was held in check,
owing to the belief mat prices were apt to be
given a sudden impetus on the outcome of the
political situation abroad. December opened
%^%c lowÂ»r, sold sparingly and declined to
e9%Â©69%c, closed at 70c.
Corn was easy early ln sympathy with wheat,
but later rallied under generous country buy-
ing Induced by wet weather and moderate re-
ceipts.
Indications of a large decrease tn the world's
visible supply, together with an improved cash
demand, helped to sustain the advance. Eleva-
tor interests during the latter part of the ses
sion bought freely. December closed at 31% c. I
Oats ruled strong, within narrow limits for
cats, on moderate receipts and a good shipping
demand. December closed at 22% c.
A decrease in stocks and higher prices for
hogs strengthened provisions. January pork
closed 6@7Vtc higher; January lard unchanged
and January ribs 2%c higher.

Harrisons' circular says: "During the week
there have been six arrivals of Coal from
Washington, amounting to 13,552 tons; one from
Oregon, 629 tons: two from British Columbia,
: 6791 tons; three from Australia, 7891 tons; one
from Baltimore, 3121 tons; one from Swansea,
1952 tons: total, 33,966 tons. The generous de
liveries this week from different sources will
ease uo all tension for the moment, as some
grades were commencing to run pretty low.
The principal shortage is for fuel adapted for
house uses, which is being forwarded with all
possible dispatch, and all procurable freight
room is being secured for that purpose. All
available tonnage is being pressed Into service,
as we must look to our northern collieries for
fully 90 per cent of our requirements for domes-
tic purposes. Consumers may well feel grati
fied that our producers have not availed them-
selves of the opportunity now offering to ad-
vance prices 10 to 20 per cent. So far they
have shown no disposition to do so, which is
most meritorious.
1 "So long as Honolulu ls willing to pay the pre-
vailing freight rates on coal from Australia
Just so long will our loading list In the Colonies
be very slim. The ruling values for Colonial
fuel here will debar our Importers from ship
ping, as they cannot cover themselves. If the
Hawaiian Islands were out of the market there
would be an Immense Influx here of Australian
coal, as present outward grain freights would
Induce coal carriers to seek this port."

TRAFFIC MANAGER LOVELAND
GIVES FACTS.
Â«
Jobbers of Middle West Hope to Get
a Decision That Will Destroy
the Advantages of Geo-
graphical Position.
The representatives of the Pacific Coast
Jobbers' and Manufacturers' Association
who are lo go to St. Louis to light out
the battle before the Interstate Commerce
Commission tor the trade of the -Pacific
Coast will leave this city on November 7.
In the meantime there is a vast amount
of work to do and Traffic Manager Love
land and Attorney Pillsbury are in fre
quent conference. The contest in behalf
of the Pacific Coast will be made upon
broad general principles. It is evident that
the geographical position of the Paciflc
Coast entitles lt to receive rates based
upon the tea competition. So much inter
est has been taken In the rate question re
cently that Traffic -Manager Loveland was
interviewed upon the principles that con
trol the situation.
"The trouble with the Jobbers of the
Middle West," said Mr. Loveland, "is that
they do not recognize the handwriting on
the wall that points to the fact that the
tendency of the age Is to localize jobbing.
There Ib a law of compensation as well
as localization and the trade which New-
York and San Francisco have lost by tne
building up of other jobbing centers has
been in large measure compensated tor by
the Increase in population of territory
naturally their own.
"St. Louis, Chicago and other jobbing
centers are not even asked to surrender
the territory that was once their own.
On the contrary, that which made it pos
sible to build up the jobbing centers on
this coast justifies our right to remain
Jobbing centers owing to our geographical
ocation. We are accessible to a highway
made by a higher power than man by
which our merchant marine can land at
our doors the products of all climes and
countries. We in turn distribute these
products to our agricultural sections and
mining regions with whose upbuilding and
prosperity our jobbing centers have ever
been and are -sb closely Identified. By
this same geographical location we also
Justify the railroads in giving us rates
and differentials to which our friends of
the Middle West strongly object. How-
can the transcontinental roads expect to
get our business except by giving us rates
that, when quickness of delivery, liability
to damage, etc., are considered, will en-
able to compete with ocean carriers?
"We were sea shippers before the rail
roads reached the coast. We are still sea
shippers and will be more so should the
time come when transcontinental roads
are bo short-sighted as to lend their aid
to the scheme of the Middle West to rob
us of our natural geographical advan
tage. Chicago and St. Louis cannot say
that they have based rates upon water
competition. Therefore they are, geo
graphically, at a disadvantage.
"We admit freely that we would not
enjoy the rates and differentials that we
have now if we were not located on the
coast. Just as frankly we say that as
we are so located the railroads must
grant us those rates, differentials, etc.. in
order to secure our business. Existing
conditions with reference to rates, differ-
entials and groupings have been brought
about hy natural adjustment. St. Louis
asks that all this shall now be changed.
Why? Simply because she wishes to do
business In this territory and is not geo-
graphically located to do so."
The Interstate Commerce Commission
will meet at St. Louis November 13.

CARPENTER DUNSTER KILLED.
Mayor Phelan Blamld for Keeping
a Rotten Ladder on His House
After Being Warned.
Mayor Phelan's neglect of a warning
given by his tenants In the building cor
ner of Thirteenth and Howard streets
was the cause of the death yesterday of
John H. Punster, a carpenter employed
by Robinson & Gillespie.
Some weeks ago the tenants notified
Mayor Phelan's agent, Robert McElroy,
that a ladder nailed to the side of the
house for the purpose of allowing me-
chanics to reach the roof to make re-
pairs, was rotten and that the cleats
would not bear the weight of a man. No
attention was paid to the complaint, and
yesterday morning Mr. Dunster ascended
! the ladder to get upon the roof to repair
i a leak caused by broken shingles. He
proceeded cautiously and had reached the
I â¢ top round of the ladder when the cleat
gave way and he was hurled to the
: ground, about fifty feet.
The unfortunate man struck upon the
top of, his head and received Injuries
j which caused his death before the ambu

NARROW ESCAPE OF THE
TRANSPORT CONEMAUGH
TWO BOAT CREWS OF THE IOWA
TO RACE TO-DAY.
Schooner Charles E. Falk Disabled at
Eureka â Off for Central
America First Ship for
Manchester Sails.
The transport Conemaugh was to have
sailed for Manila with a load of horses |
yesterday, but was delayed by what
might have proven to be a serious acci
dent. Some lumber was being taken i
aboard in slings when one of the slings j
broke and the lumber fell ends down
ward Into the hold. Luckily one of the
ballast tanks received the Impact and the
sticks of timber went through it and
saved the ship's hull. Had there been
nothing in the way the lumber would have !
gone through the transport's bottom and j
she would have sunk In her berth. As it
'* the damage can be repaired ln thirty- |
six hours and the vessel will go to sea
to-morrow.
The Harbor Commissioners and the
Postoffice officials held a conference yes
terday over the providing of room for the
Santa Fe Railroad in the new ferry de
pot. The providing of a fourteen-toot
entrance through some of the space now
occupied by the postal authorities was
discussed but- no decision was arrived at.
Two boat crews of the lowa are going
to have a stirring race to-day. There will
be fourteen men and a coxswain in each
boat and $10 an oar has been put up on
the result. The two boats will be towed
from the battleship to. Hunters Point and
from there the men will race back to tne
lowa. The two crews have been practic
ing for over a fortnight and one of the
most exciting contests ever seen on the i
bay should result. The race has grown
out of ihe recent boat drills given the
men and almost every sailor and marine
on the battleship has a dollar on Lie
result.
The schooner Herman arrived from Ko
dlak yesterday with twenty-five bales and
thirteen packages of furs and thirteen
bales of hides for the North American
Commercial Company and 113 barrels of
salmon for the Carmen Island Salt Com
pany.
Mate Harry Dillon of the steamer Emma
had a row with two of the deckhands I
yesterday that resulted in his leaving the i
ship. He gave an order to one of the men j
in regard to removing some potatoes from â 
the wharf and the sailor gave him an Im- j
pudent answer. Dillon attempted to make j
the man do his work and then the two !
deckhands Joined issues and gave t..e
mate a beating. Dillon had only been one i
day on the i-,mma and that experience j
was enough for him. He resigned at once. i
The schooner Charles E. Falk has put j
into Eureka for repairs. She left nere for j
Tacoma, but sprung her foremast head
In a gale. Captain Brown put into i.u
reka for repairs, but as he could not pro
cure a new ati -k will probably load there I
and come back to San Francisco.
The British ship British Isles will sail j
to-day for Manchester with 89,440 centals
of barley, valued at $76,552. and 9453 cen
tals of barley, valued at $10,398. This ls
the first cargo that has ever left San
Francisco for Manchester. The town ls
connected with the ' river Mersey by a
canal.
The Peru sailed for Central American !
ports yesterday. The second -'officer re
mained ashore and Third Officer Stewart
took his place. C. Nutting, formerly of |
the transport Warren, went out as third j
officer.
DR. HILL'S BUGGY ROBE.
The Coroner Overhauled a Thief Who
Wa6 Running Away With It.
Wa6 Running Away With It.
While Coroner Hill was conversing with
his deputies and two sympathizing friends I
yesterday morning in the office on Mer- ,
chant street concerning the new charter j
his attention was attracted by the watch
man of the new municipal building across j
the alley, who shouted that a man was |
stealing the buggy robe out of the doc- j
tor's buggy. Dr. Hill went downstairs
three steps at a time, followed by Deputy '
Sullivan, also a heavy-weight.
The Coroner chased the thief down the
street, and when the Coroner's horse saw i
him going in the direction of Gibbs' sa- ;
loon the well-trained animal made a mad â 
rush for the same locality, determined j
that the doctor should not break the rec- j
ord and lose him on that kind of warpath.
Deputy Sullivan had just hoisted himself ;
Into the buggy to assist In the chase as a
cavalryman or artilleryman and the horse !
ran away with him after the doctor for
about half a block.
The Coroner was handicapped by con- I
siderable surplus Weight ln the vicinity
of his waist,. but succeeded ln catching his
man about a. hundred yards up Montgom- ;
cry street, and handed him over to a pa
trolman from the California-street police
station. The prisoner was charged with
petty larceny. He gave the name of Philip
Purge and said that he was a discharged !
private of the Twenty-third Regiment of
United States Volunteers. He is evidently
a victim bf the opium habit.

Where Water Is Valuable.
The Vineyard* lrrigation District, a cor- !
poration, sued the Azusa Irrigation Com- I
pany et al. to restrain them from appro- |
i priating and diverting the waters of the
; subterranean flow of the San Gabriel ;
! river, in Los Angeles County. The flow of i
; the river, below its gravelly bed, Is of j
great volume, and ls brought into the sur- |
face canals and ditches by means of tun- i
â¢ nels. The defendants, in making answer,
asserted a right to all of the waters of the
river, prior and superior to that of the '
'â  plaintiffs. They also, by cross-complaint,
i sought to restrain the plaintiffs from fur- I
| ther taking the waters of the stream.
ln the lower court the priority of de- i
: fendants' claims was established and their
' prayer. granted. The Supreme Court yes- ;
1 terday affirmed this judgment and order. I
Dr. O'Donnell Strictly In It.
Dr. C. C. O'Donnell has entirely re
covered from a bad spell of sickness and
has Inaugurated a spirited campaign for
Coroner. Every good citizen should vote
for Dr. O'Donnell, as he was the founder
of the public Morgue and should be the
first Coroner to occupy the new- Morgue
building. Â;,*;, *

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1899.
NEGLECTED WIFE
WILL SUE FOR
A RECOMPENSE
C. Mueller's Double
Life.
DIED IN AN INSANE ASYLUM
COUPLE WERE SEPARATED BUT
NOT DIVORCED.
NOT DIVORCED.
For Fifteen Years the Dead Man and
Mrs. Lena Gehrels Maintained
a Lucrative Business Co-
partnership.
partnership.
Charles Mueller and his wife agreed to ,
an amicable separation three months ago ,
'and the wife did not see her husband
again until last Wednesday afternoon,
when she found him lying dead In an un
| dertaking parlor on Mission street. She
j saw the notice of his death ln The Call â 
I and arrived at the parlors just ten mm- ;
i utes before he was taken out to be burled.
A few weeks after the separation Muel
ler, who had shown erratic tendencies for ;
j several years, was committed to the Napa ,
! Insane Asylum, where he died on October I
22. Now the wife will begin proceedings i
through her attorney for several hundred
dollars which the deceased had on deposit
ln the Hlbernia Bank and some valuable I
Jewelry which Is alleged to be ln posses- j
sion of Mrs. Lena Gehrels, for whom
Muelier had neglected his wife during the â 
past fifteen years.
Mueller was well known in the down-
town business section, having kept a
saloon and restaurant at 120 California
street up to two years ago. It is said that
Mrs. Gehrels started tne business with
him and invested $3000 which she received
as insurance on her husband's life. The
business prospered and In 1890 Mueller
loaned Mrs. Gehrels $6000 to build four
fiats on Filbert street. The money. It is
understood, has since been repaid. Mrs.
Gehrels lived in the lower flat at 927 Fil
bert street with her two daughters, while
Mueller and his wife occupied the upper
flat.
Gossips say that Mueller was more at
tentive to Mrs. Gehrels than to his own
wife, and this is corroborated by Mrs.
Mueller herself. She states that while
Mueller was lavishing money on Mrs.
Gehrels she was sadly neglected, and af-
fairs in the two households became so un
bearable that she was obliged to move
around the corner on Jones street. Muel
ler then gave his wife but $30 a month out
of which she had to pay $20 for rent. Mrs.
Gehrels is said to have acquired a for
tune of over $30,000 on her original Invest-
ment of $3000 in the business with Mueller.
When Mueller and * his wife separated
she received $700 ln cash and part of the
household furniture, while he got $2200.
It is the remainder of this money, if there
be any, and the jewelry which he pos
sessed at the time of his death that Mrs.
Mueller seeks to obtain, and lf she has
not waived her rights by reason of the
articles of separation her attorney, Sam
uel Rosenheim, will apply for letters of
administration on behalf of the wife.

rubbed with bullock's blood, glistens like

from a couple of fiddlers in a corner of tha
room. -Bride and bridegroom open ths
hall and the floor is soon covered with
â whirling couples.
"By 11 o'clock the children, who swarm
in the . side rooms, tire not to be kept
quiet longer even by hunches of bread and
cake; there is a general howl and wail
that rises yet higher than the scraping or
fiddles, and mothers rush from their part-
ners to knock small heads together and
cuff little nursemaids and force the wall-
ers down Into unoccupied corners of beds,
under tables and behind boxes.
"In half an hour every variety of child
ish snore ls heard on all sides, and it has
become perilous to raise or set down a

TO CALIFORNIA COMES THE HONOR OF HAVING THE THIRD COMMANDERY OF THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN WARS
TO perpetuate among their descend-
ants Hie memory of the men who
were instrumental ln establishing
the Colonies of North America and
were founders of this nation; of the
men who achieved American independ

naval positions of trust assisted in the
preservation of the republic In the 1812;
Mexican and Civil wars: collecting for
preservation documents relating to those
periods: providing suitable commemora
tions of the prominent events connected
with those periods; and Inspiring ln its
companions the fraternal and patriotic

call upon the owner of the sheet he liked

gatherings was esteemed a great honor

make or break a performer. For a man
possessed of such vast power he used lt

prejudices and highly partial. Particular

On Tuesday
October 3.1,
o
is
Halloween,
Halloween.
Look
Out
'lor Your
ior Yonr
Future
Spouse
THE very mention of Halloween calls
up visions of ghosts and witches
and all kinds of uncanny things. It
ls the one night ln the year when
J^ even the uninitiated, if they are
brave enough, may converse with
spooks and hobgoblins, and may also, if
they try hard enough, send the immate
rial part of their being prancing through
space on all kinds of errands. It Is safe
to surmise that the latter privilege is not
often taken advantage fot. It is hard
enough to keep soul and body together
without hunting up excuses to separate
them. But the grand object of all the
mystic rites peculiar to Halloween is to
find out who one's future spouse will be
âthat Ing a very Important question
with those who have never had one.
The most infallible of the many Infalli
ble ways by which a girl may get a
glimpse of her future husband is to re
tire in silence. That alone is hard
enough, but that is not all. She must lie
there, speechless and in the dark, until
Just before the stroke of 12, when she
must rise and, standing before the mir
ror, it an apple while combing her hair.
If she doesn't see her "future" peeping
over her shoulder it's because she is des
tined to be an old maid, or she was too
scared to look.
Another way that does not .-equire so
much courage is to write the alphabet
on twenty-six little slips of paper, one
letter on each .-lip, and then urn them
face down in a basin of water. This done,
go to bed backward and in silence. Si
lence seems to be the main requirement
in ail these endeavors to coax one's af
finity to make himself, or herself, known.
Next morning some of the letters in the
basin will be found face up and the name
thus revealed will give the desired infor
mation.
A more comfortable custom is to wet
tho sleeve of a shirt and hang it before
the fire to dry. Then lie in bed and watch
lt until midnight, when the apparition of
the future husband or wife will' appear
and turn the sleeve.
If a girl has two lovers and cannot de
cide which one to choose, she may let
fate settle the matter in the following
manner. Eat an apple and then, naming
two Of the seeds, stick one on each cheeK
and bay:
Pippin, pippin, I stick thee there.
j stick thee there.
That which is true thou mayst declare.
The one that stays tho longest is the
must faithful lover, and therefore the
most desirable. Â«-
There la a custom ln Wales on Hal-
loween of building a huge bonfire, and
wher. the fire i--: almost out each member
of the party gathered about it throws in
a white stone, marked for future identi
fication, lv the morning a search is made
in ti.e embers and if one stone is missing
It Indicates that the person who threw
it In will not live to repeat the perform-
ance the next All Lints' eve.
Many of the customs mentioned by
Robert Hums are now- obsolete, but one
stii: in vogue is that of pulling kail or
cabbage stalk. A young couple are blind
folded and then, taking each other by the
hand, they go into the garden and each
pulls a stalk at random and they return
to th.c fireside, where their prizes cause a
great deal of merriment. As the stalk is
long or short, straight or crooked, so
shall the future husband or wife be. The
quantity of earth sticking to the root in
dicates the amount of wealth and the
taste of the pith the kind of temper "tie
must expect. Finally the stalks are
placed over the door, and the christian
names of the next two entering will be
the names of the future husband and
wife.
A custom that is quite common in this
count! aiso Is to ike three saucers and
fill c:.. with clean and another with dirty
water.' The third remains empty. The
part;. wishing to know his destiny is
blindfolded and led to tie hearth, where
the saucers have been arranged. If he
dips his finger in the clean water he will
marry a maid, but If in the? dirty water a
widow will knd him to the altar. The
empty dish signifies that a life of single

Apples and nuts play a very important
part in the mystic rites of Halloween. One
way to find out If one's sweetheart is
true Is to place three nuts upon .lie bar
of the grate or on the hearth, naming the
nuts for the loved one. If a nut cracks
or jumps, look for another sweetheart
right away, for the one you have will
surely be unfaithful. If a nut burns that
Is a sign that your affection ls reciprocated.
but if two of the ruts burn together the
young lady making the trial may as well
begin preparing her trousseau at once,
for there will surely be an early wed-
ding.
Halloween parties must always be made
as weird and uncanny as possible, and
* any one with original id< ie may give
them full scope on these occasions. One
very quaint affair that 1 recall may
' serve as a model.
In the first place the Invitations were
most unique* Witches and goblins ran riot
over the card and the utmost secrecy in
regard to the approaching event was ex-
acted. Silence, too, was enjoined,, and
every one was veiled, and it certainly was
a very ghostly crowd that gathered
promptly at the appointed time in the
dimly lighted hallway. Suddenly the
sound of a bell -was heard, soft and- muf-
fled, as If it were high up In an old church
tower, and as it struck 9 the doors were
thrown open and the young people were
ushered into a veritable witches' den.
Death heads, made from pumpkins, with
a small lighted candle inside, grinned
from the mantel, the cornices and the
most unexpected places. Huge cobwebs,
In which were monster spiders, were
stretched across the corners and over the
mirrors. Immense bats with outspread
wings were apparently flying through the
air and great owls glared from every pos
sible resting place. In the fireplace, the
grate had been removed and in its stead
a large caldron was simmering over a pale
green blaze.
The hostess and her assistants were
witches, gowned in flowing black robes
and crownev with tall, pointed caps. In-
visible music of a weird character added
to the uncanniness of the scene. The
gentlemen were all in an adjacent room
and tbe hostess, taking a lady by the
hand, would advance with tier and knock
three times on the door with the small
broom she carried. In answer to her
knock a gentleman would appear, and
Offering the lady his arm retire to a dis
tant part of the room. When, in this
manner, the couples had all been paired
off the wltchefe wave,] their arms and
crooned in the most approved witch
manner and the screeching of the violins
outside became truly blood-curdling. Sud
denly, with a crash and a bang, the noise
ceased and the room was filled with light '
When the light revealed the partners that
at Buenos Ayres, and which I had still
on board. I arranged forward on the look-
out, dressed as a seaman, attaching a line

That made three of us. and we did not
want to "yammerschooner;" but for all
that the savages came on faster than be-
fore. . I saw that besides four at the pad-
dles In the canoe nearest to me. there
were others in the bottom, and that they
were shifting hands often. : At eighty
yards I fired a shot across the bow of the
nearest' canoe, at which they all stopped,
but only for a moment. Seeing that they
persisted ln coming nearer, I fired the
second shot so close to the chap who
wanted to "}*ammerschooner" that he
changed hie mind quickly enough and bel-
lowed with fear. "Bueno yo via Isla,"

fate had given each for the evening there
as a good deal of merriment. At a sig-
nal from the First Witch a couple went
Into the outer darkness to pull "kail"
stalks. Of course they had been prepared
beforehand and there was not a straight
one in the whole lot. After this ordeal
had been gone through by every one a
decrepit old hag. with a real, live owl
perched on her shoulder, entered the
room. On her arm hung a basket full
of nuts. Passing through the crowd she
gave each a nut and then.' standing by
the fireplace, she mumbled some unin-
telllgible Jargon and the room suddenly
became darkened again. Stooping over
the caldron she muttered an Incantation
and red fire Immediately blazed from Its
depths. She then tottered out of the
room, which again was illuminated as she
disappeared. The nuts, when cracked,
were found to contain a fortune, written,
on a slip of paper. For example, "You
will have many trials until the age of 30,
when good luck will come to you." The
nuts for the gentlemen were tied with
red ribbons and those for the ladies with
blue. .V - Â
During the evening all sorts of games,
peculiar to Halloween, were added to the
programme. A stick was suspended hori-
zontally from the celling and on one end
was a short piece of lighted candle, while
an apple was stuck *on the other, and
the whole thing set whirling. A small
basket was then passed around in which
were a number of slips of paper. The
unfortunate who drew the paper with a
skull and cross-bones on It had to furnish

amusement for the rest by trying to get
a bite from the apple on the whirling
stick. Luckily for the girls, a man drew
the fatal slip, but before he had burned
his mustache off the First Witch took
pity on him and clapped her hands. Over
the door leading Into the dining-room a
dark, heavy portiere hung and at the slg
nal an apple rolled under the curtain and
went spinning over the floor. "It was fol
lowed by another and then ether, until
everybody had one. Knives were then
passed around and a merry half-hour was
spent In peeling the apples and throwing
the unbroken skin over the shoulder In
such a manner as to form the Initial of
the future husband or wife, In one of
the apples a needle was Imbedded in the
core, indicating that the finder would
enjoy a domestic or wedded life. Another
contained a pen. foretelling a literary
career, and in still another a tiny pencil
was buried, signifying a life devoted to
art. In a fourth a small piece of wood
was hidden on which the word "music"
had been written.
A few moments before midnight the
merry-makers were all taken out the
kitchen door and separated Into two
groups, the girls on one side and the
gentlemen on the other. At the first
stroke of twelve both groups started and
ran, one going one way and the other in
the opposite direction, all to meet at the
front door. The first couple to reach the
goal would be the first to marryâ not each
other, necessarilyâ and the last to arrive

When the race was over, the breathless

venison stew soon put me right, so that
I could sleep. As drowsiness came on I
first sprinkled the deck with the tacks
that my old friend Sambllch had given
me, and then I turned in.
Now, it Is well known that one cannot
istep on a tack without saying something
about it. A pretty good Christian will
whistle when he steps on the "commercial
end" of a carpet tack; a savage will howl
and claw the alr, and that was just what
happened that night about 12 o'clock
while I- was asleep in the cabin, where
the ; savages thought they "had me,"
sloop and all. They changed their minds,
however, when they stepped on deck, for
then they thought that I or somebody
else had them. I had no need of a dog;
they howled like a pack of hounds. I
had hardly uso for a gun. They jumped
pell-mell, ; some into their canoes and
some. Into the sea, to cool off, I suppose,
and there was a deal of free language
over It as they went. I fired the rascals
a salute of several guns t when I came on
deck, to -let them know that I was at
home, and then I turned in again, feeling
sure that- 1 should not be â¢ disturbed any

laughing crowd was summoned to supper,
and there another surprise awaited them.
The decorations in the dining-room were
red. even the tablecloth being of the same
brilliant hue.' Over the center of the
round table a huge owl. with outspread
wings, was suspended from the ceiling.
In its claws it held the ends of four long
red ribbons, the other ends of which were
held in the corners of the room, near the
celling, by bats, lizards and spiders. The
shade on the lamp was red crepe paper,

But the rising generation of Boers are

Dutch are taught In the schools. Oom
Paul understands English as well as I do
myself. Many times when 'playing or
dancing for him I would forget and make
some remark in English. He would al

The gift of a cake is always accompanied
with a request to pray for the souls of the

is generally very profuse In his promises
to pray dnd calls down the blessings of
heaven on everything he or she can think

cautions.
He lives the life of a Damocles. The
sword banging above his head is that
wielded by long-armed Russia. There are
three (socialist exiles known to oe living
in California, and he is one of the three.
Russia has a hundred eyes and fingers
that reach, cruel and eager '-'1 clutch
ing, to the ends of all the lands that be. .
Paul Melnikoff has not been nblo to hide
from the eyes, but he has slipped three
times from the fingers as they were about
to close upon him. How much longer
must the Inevitable await Its victim?
Melnlkoff's troubles date back to some
forty years ago, when he was born with
a free spirit. The first homo that he re
members was in a Russian town on the
Dona Riverâ a town that I won't men
tion, because I'm sure you could not pro
nounce it even if I could spell lt. He is
the son of a nobleman, who sent his boy
â¢while still young to the Gymnasia at
Petersburg.
This Gymnasia Is like that of Germany
nothing more nor less than high school in
plain English. Here Paul, the youngster.
received his education, and when Paul the
man showed a taste for the study of
medicine he was sent to the Academy of
Medicine, also in Petersburg. There
he spent two years.
It would have taken much longer to
complete a medical course. But while
yet a student Melnikoff acquired his ruin
ous habit of thinking for himself. This
led him whither it leads many a victim.
But for it ho might to-day be comfort
ably budgeted in a Russian sleigh making
the rounds of a thrifty practice. As It is,
he stitches, stitches, day In and day out,
In the tiny tailor room on Natoma street.
His flrst dangerous move was to Join the
Party for the Freedom of the Country.
The very name smacks of all that is
hateful to Russian Government.
Somehow no direct results followed
from his joining this party, but it was
the beginning of the end. lt was his
flrst taste of independenceâ it was a
delicious taste. The next move was to
Join a socialist societyâ and Pa
roskyâand In this he made speeches.
Down swooped the Government. One
member of the society was banged and
Melnikoff, 19 years old, rashly outspoken,
zealous to white heat, was borne to the
Petersburg torti
"He'll have a chance to cool," some-
"He'll have a chance to cool," some
body said.
"The rats will listen to his speech-mak
ing now," Jeered another.
"So you think you going to teach the
Czar how to manage his affairs, do you?"
"You're a fine one to teach him. Never
mind, sonny, you'll grow older in time."
Then the lock ground and clanked itself
Bhut and Paul turned and faced the damp
darkness.
It was so dark that at first he could
barely distinguish what little was in the
cell. The only light came from a crack
of a window above. As his eyes came
to see they made out a stone fioor, damp,
bare walls, and the merest necessities of
furniture. These were all of iron and
were fastened against the wall. There
was an iron-seated chair, an iron-mat
tressed bed.
For six months he waited in the fort
ress. He saw no one but the guards, he
heard nothing from the outside world.
Meals were brought to the cell. They
were not bad meals and they were doubly
welcome, being the only diversion.
At the end of the six months came a
break in the monotony of life. Word
came suddenly that Melnikoff was to be
transported to Siberia. The word was
not of a nature to be disputed. Melni
koff went.
Karra, as we spell it, or Kara, as the
Russians prefer it, was his destination.
The prison stood dull and low and black
against a drive of gray afternoon snow.
The sky looked thick and close to the
earth. In all directions was bleak, drift
covered land and dumb, blundering snow.
The prison of Karra stood alone. It
crouched low and groveling and leper
like. It opened slow, cautious doors to
its new occupant, and when he was once
inside it shut the doors again surely. It
I
bade him a cynical welcome for twenty
years.
When he entered upon his new life the
despair was not at Its worst. He found
the prison life more comfortable, more
sociable than it htyi been in his fortress
cell at Petersburg. He had some 170 men
for companions, all socialists like him
self, and nearly all well educated. The
five-room building was dreary enough and
without adornment, but there were com
fortable stoves provided and the beds
could be slept upon. Besides this, the
prisoners were allowed to receive certain
gifts from home, so that a collection of
books had gradually grown to almost 8000
volumes, and there were enough musical
instruments for a little orchestra. Melni
koff himself used to rattle away many
an hour at the piano.
All this seemed like prison life made
easy. The socialists^ thought with pity
of the sufferings in the criminal prison,
where men and women led the life of
dogs, and outcast dogs at that. But their
own case called for self pity before nine
months of Paul's Imprisonment had worn
themselves out.
The Government took sudden alarm.
The exact cause was never known to the
men within tho barnlike walls. At any
rate, the result was summary. Officials
came one day and brought assistants.
There were sleighs waiting while they en
tered.' '-Wzx
"All these books are to be taken away,"
came the order.
Ruthless hands swept up the treasured
library. All the volumes, read and re
read and loved and cherished, were load
eel Into the sleighs.
"The musical Instruments nelct." ... .., â
One by one they went, flute and violin
and piano and all the rest.
"Every man's clothes to be exchanged
for prison garb."
Rough voices commanded and rough
hands hurried. The citizen's clothing
which had been worn by every man with
the individuality which is part and paicel
of honest pride was exchanged for the
bitter humiliation of shame-bearing uni
form.
The men were given coarse underwear
that rasped the flesh and made even the
chill of Its absence a relief. The suit was
heavy and awkward, almost covered by a
long gray overcoat. The overcoat could
not be avoided, it must be worn and
worn with all Its flaming taunts. For on
Its back was the dreaded yellow stamp â
two diamond-shaped figures and below
them the word "Prisoner."
Even this badge was not enough. Each
prisoner's head must be shaved on ti.e
right sideâ the old-time stamp of cap
tivity. Atop the grotesque heads were
perched round gray caps, such as dub a
man convict. And still the Government
was not satisfied.
"They have had a good time long
enough," growled the wearer of much
insignia.
"They must be tired walking so much.
These wiil help them to .rest." The offi
cer laughed as he sprung fast a set of
chains.
The chaining did not stop until it had
gone the rounds of all the socialists in
Kara prison. It was dealt out In differ
ent degrees. Melnlkoft's ankles were
held .by the distance of a short step
apart. He was one of the favored. He
saw hands as well as feet locked on all
sides and he saw men riveted: for all the
long years to come to the comradeship of
a wheelbarrow. Where they went the
wheelbarrow must go until it rotted ln Its
own fetters.
For eight years Paul Melnlkoff's ankles
chafed and ceased to chafe under their
burden^ He wore the convict trousers
that buttoned above the foot to make
room for chains. He went and came
among men who despaired and sickened
and died. He walked, short of step and
heavy of foot, within the limits marked
by rifle-bearing soldiers. He lived with
out any greeting spoken except to and
from men who spoke it In the same night
mare as his. Even work, for which they
Implored, was denied the socialist â¢ pris
oners. The nightmare deepened and many
went mad. .-VAi-.^'-v
"After awhile you grow to see one face
always one face." Mr. Melnikoff says.
"It Is the same with all the men."
The one kind of work allowed their
hands was cooking. Turn and turn about,
seven at a time, the prisoners worked in
the kitchen. The fare was good enough.
Russia allowed her victims a quarter
pound of beef daily, besides black flour
for bread, buckwheat and potatoes. The
meals were eaten in the living and sleep
ing rooms, whore men. gathered at rough
tables or leaned in the bunks which had
replaced beds, or sank into their Insepar
able wheelbarrows.
One small room was dignified by the
name of hospital and here the sick were
cared for by any of their fellow prisoners
who would and could. Melnikoff could
laugh even then and he .can laugh even
now at the recollection of a dignified and
philosophical socialist who tried playing
dletlst for the first time. "There was
chicken soup to be made for a sick man,"
he relates, "and jmy j philosopher friend
plucked the chicken, prepared lt and hung
it against the wall while he went to boil
the water. He seasoned It* with" great
care, but when he took it to the invalid
the man asked why it tasted so watery.
My philosopher friend remembered that
the chicken still hung against the wall."
Money might be sent the prisoners by
their parents only. Some received good
sized sums, others none at all. A system
of communism existed among them, and
it was agreed that whatever money came
was to be put together and used for the
benefit of â¢ all. Newspapers and books
were forbidden; there was no way to use
the gifts except to add to the food, pro
vided or to buy tobacco. The money was
Intrusted- to gendarmes, who made â¢ the
little purchases. , Yp*. %-. '-'
. Smoking was the one luxury, and it
was constant. The money sent by par
ents kept the men in tobacco and cigar
ette paper. .Mr. Melnikoff showed me a
tiny, close-written, budget' of memoirs
made of this very cigarette paper, which
THE SUNDAY CALL.
was the only kind permitted. On the
little sheets of it and on scraps of wrap
ping paper cherished in secrecy the pris
oners wrote a weekly newspaper called
the Kara and circulated when guards
dozed or chatted.
The same locked box which holds the
memoirs holds also a bundle of letters
received during those eight years. The
socialists could write to no one, but let
ters could be received by them after they
had' been carefully read by an officer in
charge. Across every one of their pages
was daubed the officer's stamp ln yellow
acid. ?;.â';
There came a time when reckless men
entered a mad protest against their treat
ment and gave In feebly at last, as others
had done before them. The provocation
was the treatment of a woman In the
woman's division of the socialist prison.
The trouble arose during the visit of the
Governor General. When he entered a
certain room one woman remained seated.
"Why don't you rise?" he snarled.
"Why should I rise for you?" she re-,
torted. "You are the cause of our suffer
ing."
The man fumed. "Fifty lashes," he or-
The man fumed. "Fifty lashes," he or
dered, after having. a superficial examina
tion made by a physician who swore that
fifty lashes were safe. The woman died.
Whipping was unprecedented in the so
cialists' prison. The Inmates were intelli
gent people who had always received,
even at the worst, somewhat better tteit
ment than criminals. They rose as one
man and demanded justice.
The only justice rendered was a brief
Imprisonment for the physician. All
others concerned were exonerated. The
prisoners grew desperate.
"Let ' us starve ourselves," the leader
said. "Wee may frighten the powers .in
that way."
â  Day after day they fasted. Four died
for want of food, and others, not able
to endure the slow death, shot, poisoned
or hanged themselves. In all twelve died.
But the Government only continued to
send food.
And so the protest died out, and the
great still despotism went on as before.
There came a day when Paul Melnikoff,
great 3turdy Russian that ho was, gave
way under the strain. He' had lived
through his boyhood with a sound mind
in a sound body; now he had neither.
Brain fever developed.
There were days and nights of suffer
ing and delirium, in which he burned the
memoirs and novels that he had painfully
written on slowly gathered bits of pa
per. When â he woke he - had forgotten
even his name. < â¢â¢
- Little by little strength and memory
returned, and then came news that posed
as generous. His sentence to imprison
ment for twenty years was to be com
muted.' Now, when-half- that' time had
not yet expired, he was to be granted
freedom as wide as the boundaries of Si
beria. Exile he must still remain.
The chains were loosened and they fell
from weary ankles. Paul Melnikoff
stepped forth past the rifle-bearing sol
diers for the first time in almost nine
years. He looked about him vaguely and
lifted his feet as if they were yet heavy.
Here was freedom, after a fashion, but
what to do with It?
Those who set him free said: "Go to
Amoor. That is the place for exiles. You
can farm there." : â  *â < -. -. â¢ .*-.-.,*' --.â¢ '*- " .
He went to Amoor, but he did not
farm. He thought over the things that
he knew how to do, and he chose school
teaching.
In the town he started a school for boys
and girls. He found patrons and the en-
terprise throve. Then one day came the
announcement that he was a socialist,
an exile. When people heard this they
withdrew their children from his classes.
He must earn a living somehow. The
way. came when he fell in with the cap-
tain of a steamer on the Amoor River.
He was finally made second captain.
This lasted no longer than the school.
Word came racing after him . that the
Government would not permit him to
carry on the work.
Next he traveled to Vladivostok. He
had been given a passport when he left
the prisonâ a passport that was good all
over Siberia. He had been told then that
he was free to go wherever It carried him.
In Vladivostok ho became manager of
a railway station. The position was good,
and as the weeks went by he began to feel
the self-respect of Independence return
ing. He met a Russian woman who was
young and free and good to look upon.
He loved her and married her.
He had been in the railway station for
eleven mohths when the Government
reached after him. "You must go back
to Amoor and live away from all towns.
Take a farm," he was told.
He replied by showing his passport
which gave him the freedom of all Si
beria. "That makes no difference. The
Government commands," was all the 'an-
swer. &Â«.,->' . â  i
-Then he grew bitter where before he
had been gloomy. "A robber or murderer
ls treated better," he said. -'When they
are set free nobody hunts them down.
They are at least forgotten."
Then followed one. of the escapes that
are famous the world over. â  It was made
in disguise. An American captain. In the
year 1595, took on board a Russian and his
wife who had outwitted the shrewdest
of Russian guards. Melnikoff's use of
French had enabled him to carry out his
disguise. , .
He sailed for Manila, but found hard
times waiting for him there. One hun-
dred Mexican dollars paid his own and
his wife's passage to Hongkong and there
he worked for the ten cents a day which
the white man must accept if he will com-
pete with native labor. A friend whom he
met.there helped him to Singapore, and
there Melnikoff opened a store and began
to feel like a man once .man.
â** But it was not , long . before he learned
that the Russian Consul- at Singapore
had received a . letter saying that . Paul
Melnikoff, an escaped exile, was In his
city, and he must investigate the matter
and take action. Cautiously the Consul
went about lt.
flfl: EXISTENCE OF PERSE-

A Russian ship from the Bering Sea
arrived, and the captain sent to Melnikoff
to bargain for provisions. He agreed to
have them delivered before time for the
ship to sail. The captain told him that
he must come himself for his payment.
-.Danger seemed ln the air. The knowl
edge of the Consul's knowledge, the man
ner of the captain, all whispered risk and
mystery. He consulted an Englishman
who was well posted. The Englishman
tola him that he could not be arrested in
the city, but on board a Russian vessel
he would be In the power of the Czar.
When he went on board it was nearly
time for the ship to -sail. He took natives
with him who were his friends, and they
were armed with knives. "If any one at
tempts to hold me, fight," he directed
When he arrived on deck and the cap
tain met him, there ensued a war of di
plomacy-that lasted until time for the
vessel to leave. The captain first. invited
him into the cabin, then urged, then in

that he could receive the money on deck
as well as within. He did not care to
drink. There was no -further business be
tween them.
For more than an hour the captain per

Melnikoff had an Indelible pencil in his
pocket. He could not be beguiled into
leaving his attendants and entering the
cabin.
So the vessel departed and he was safe "
But the Consul was very angry. -He
could work darkly and prudently no
longer. He deliberately summoned his
victim. .........
"You are an escaped exile and I will
have you arrested," he announced.
. Melnikoff was prepared. He gave au
thority for the statement that he could
not be takenâ there .was no extradition
law to warrant such- doings.
The Consul was more angry. "I will
have you arrested for vagrancy."

of the battle with all speed, and every

reached the spot where the great whale
was last seen, nothing but foaming
water, reddened with blood, marked the
locality. There were several old-time
sailors on board the steamer and they
all agreed that a battle unto death be
tween a Bivordfish and a female whale
had been fought before their eyes. The
swordfish had the advantage of the
great sea mammal and was thrusting
its only weapon of attack and defense
âthe long, sharp and pointed swordâ
Into the vulnerable sides of the un
wieldy whale. The great mammal
could but thrash its tail about in im

consequence many a trait, of Indian life
and the pastimes of the icebound .whalers
have missed the camera. ':â >
The winter of 1890-91 was. the first one
the Hume spent in the, Arctic, -in the
spring of ISP2 she was the first the field
and secured the phenomenal ..catch," of
thirty-six whales. At thUt-.tlmc the price
of whalebone was, very high and; a whale
was valued* at from $10,000 tojla.ooo,- ac-
cording to his size. The Hume's catch
realized nearly half a million- -dollars.

Soon it was seen that they were sword-
fish. The season was when the flsh are
unusually ferocious. They had made
several rushes, and when observed
were at close quarters, striking each
other powerful side blows like cavalry-
men. This was unsatisfactory, and
Anally they separated and darted at '
each other other like arrows, the water
hissing as their sharp dorsal flns cut
through it. They evidently struck:
head-on, one missing, while the! eword
of the other struck Just' below the eye
and plowed a deep furrow in the . fiah, ;
partly disabling it so that it turned'
and attempted to escape. .But its ad- .
versary also .turned, and with a rush
drove its sword completely through the -
body of Its foe and held it fast, only
wrenching its weapon loose when its
enemy stopped swimming. -
This one lunge finished the battle,
' and the victor left the field. 'â¢* The van-"

several hundred people in Los An-

whales, but did not get hack to her^^B

in the open and had to make her bed off"
S. a' Horse Island. Once more her crew had
to winter alone, but by this time they were
â u/ed to it and Old not suffer much from
loneliness in consequence. - -â 
In September, 1897, Captain Leavitt. went
from the Hume to the Newport and Cap
tain William Hegarty, a New England
man, kook charge of the little brigantine.
For the first time in her life as a whaler
not a- whale was taken during the season.
In disgust Captain Hegarty started- for
San '.Francisco, but the Arctic froze very
early, that year, and in company with half
a dozen other vessels the Hume was
caught" out In the open. The news reach
ed San ' Francisco on the steam whaler
Alexander and was told exclusively ln
The Call. Through the efforts of this pa

'the' revenue cutter Bear and the men of
the fleet were saved from ; starvation.

ashore' and ground to pieces.- -but the
Hume escaped. That . season she took
thirteen whales to make up for the fall

so .that In nine years her different crews
have* taken eighty-seven whales, valued
at over a million dollars net, and yet the
Hume Ms: only 100 tons net burden and
.looks like a box under steam. â On her way

severe -'storm.-' her forefoot was carried
away and she. began to leak. A couple of

One of the most curious

tered hulk without masts, bulwarks
or name. The craft hart been a brig,
and she was a Russian. Her hatches
I were on and Jr--- cabin doors fast, and
markable cases on record Is that of the
ship Dreadnought. One day at sea
the crew felt a sudden shock, and soon
after that the ship sprung a . leak and
was obliged to put into port. It was
found when she was drydocked that a
large swordfish had struck her. The
sword had penetrated the copper, then
the thick oak hull, passing through the
thick pine sheathing, and finally enter
ing the head of a barrel. The sword
was broken off short, partly plugging
the wound.
. One of the finest specimens of the
Tetrapturus albidus ever seen in Cali
fornia waters was found recently on
the shore off San Diego. It was a mag
nificent specimen, about . six feet in
length, [ the body ' massive and f power
ful . and remarkable for its shape. It
did not taper to the tail, as many of,
its. tribe do, but continued large all the'
way to the tail, which was powerful.
It had a long dorsal An almost the en

was short. Evidently .the sword had
been partly broken off in a fierce com

out of the belly of
an iceberg. She had
little cargo, and that
consisted of skins
and furs in prime
condition. No papers
were found In her
cabin, but it was
figured that she was
a sealer or trader,
carrying a crew of
ten or twelve, and
that she. had been
provisioned for a
year. The flour
aboard tasted like
chalk, but the beef
was perhaps better
than the day It was
put on board. She
had been abandoned
when frozen In, and
the dark color of the
woodwork and the
growth of i moss
proved that she had
drifted for years.

beach and the comb

her. They got out
the furs, which
brought them $4000,
hoisted out a couple
of barrels of beef,
and then set fire to
the wreck, and little
remained of her
when the story leak

hulk had come down
from the far north
was proved only a
few weeks later by
the log of an Eng

doubtless succumbed to a fierce thrust
from an enemy, possibly a Xiphlus, or
long swordfish, as it had a single cut
two and a half inches wide that pene
trated the entire* body like a knife
thrust. The defeated swordfish had ap

fight. Armed with a short sword or

IT was eleven at night. A little moon-
lit mist slid ln from the Point and
stole, shimmering, over the Presidio
hill. Beneath It the still tents were
sketched sharply In black and white.
Eleven o'clock and all's wellâ all
that might be seen. Soldiers slept In their
little slant-roofed houses. Other soldiers
came rollicking campward In a late car.
Eleven o'clock and all's well.
Past the gloom of the trees and across
thq bare slope 'beyond I walked to the
hospital. It rose still and big and dim.
and seemed to say in dignity, "Here, too,
a.i is well." In the rear of It, opening
from the square court, I found ten wards.
Within them stood long rows of beds
Where men lay delirious and dying. They
aro the part of our army who cannot lie
quiet and dreamless under canvas, nor
make merry '.*:â¢.'. merriment fades Into
Bleepy hours. Instead, they toss through
long nights of feverish dreams and wake
to dreary thoughts of the other boys who
are up and off to faraway homes.
The whole night through I watched wit.i
the watchers. The corps of night nurses
had gone on duty at 7:30, and I followed
the course of their twelve-hour labor un
til 7:30 of the next day brought them to
bedtime. Twenty-four hours of hard
labor Is divided between, two sets of work

The powers that he at the United
States General Hospital of San Francisco
have probably forgotten the rhyme. It's
only an old jingle, anyway.
1 began with the surgical ward. I read
the posted instructions carefully before
entering: "No admittance without a
pass,*' and "Don't slam the door." I
drew out my potent Blip that bears the
signature of Colonel Girard, and then en
teredâa hush.
The glimmer from one screened light
and the cuddiiy-warm stove made ghosts
of the white iron beds and paled adown
the length of the room until the ghosts
faded away Into measureless dark. A
nurse crept, still of foot and grave of
face, to meet me and drew me into the
warmth. "These boys are mostly con
valescent," she said, "they are sleeping."
The door was closed. There was only
one sound to be heard for the length of
the ward. It was the sound of many
men Bleeping the sleep of pain.
The breath came wearily heavy from
one, short and struggling from another.
Rustling and turning were heard. Moans
broke in now and thenâ moans that the
waking man would choke back scorn
fully, that sleep warily wrings from _
him, off his guard. A
The nurse gave me a seat by the Am
crooning fire, whore her own chair AW
and table stood. A book or two and M__
a magazine lay on the table. _U
"You have a comfortable place
to rest and read," I whispered
Rhe smiled soberly. "We don't
have time to reach much," she
A cough of waking sounded
from the other end of the
ward. She rose, with a firm
hand stilling the chair, and
pattered away.
Alone in the drowsy
warmth. I stared at the
beds, and little by little
my eyes taught them
selves to see dim shapes.
When the nurse re
turned it was to strike
a match and select medi
cine from a case in the
center of the room. "We
hardly ever wake a man
to dose him, but this â 
one has waked him- I
self," she explained.

through the in
of shiny white painted
rooms, clean and druggy
rooms, cK-an and druggy

and span little room where
the water Is sterilized, and be-
sides this are places wher mcdi- â 
cines and bandages range, shelf upon
shelf, and there are lavatories, and
beyond them all is the operating
room. Its walls are high and white, and
the operating table waits, fixed and
ghastly In the center. Unrelenting Bteel
things glitter on tables made of sterilized
glass; savage little instruments, with the
savagery born at civilization. It Is the
cleanest, crudest place i ever saw.
"The surgical ward Is especially hard
on account of the constant dressing of
wounds," the nurse said.
And as I progressed I found every one
especially hard. The nurses are a quiet
set of women, too busy to find time for
complaint. But whoever thinks army
nursing an easy life let him try, or even
watch a night of It.
It was at 12 o'clock that all the night
nurses left their wards in the charge of
the assistants and betook themselves to
the kitchen of the nurses' building for
lunch. It is an informal little meal, where
the ten drop In and drop out as quickly
as they can do so. A tall woman, good
of heart and clever of cookery, nerved
steak and potatoes and mushrooms from
the brick range, and every luncher had
brought her own cup for coffee. The
lunch was good, but it was swallowed in
dinner-nail time, In order to be back with
the boys.
"Are any of yours dying?" one of
them said. \x.-y2
"Yes," replied her neighbor, "two of
them won't last through the night, the
doctor thinks.
"How is your thin man?"
"Just the same. He is one who can't
live."
"Did yoa know that Miller was very
stubborn ln objecting to a change of
wards?"
"All the boys are like that. They al
ways like their flrst nurse best." v\*:";>;
This was another phase. "It takes tact
to get along with them, doesn't. it?" I
asked. Xx-X.- X- .2yX .:!Z'--
"Tact? I should think so. A sick man
ls usually not very different from a
child. Sometimes a nurse will try the
work and not be able to get along at all."
"Number 28 talks, all the time about his
money."
"Wha: Is the matter?"
"What is the matter?"

wore a crisp little military jacket over
her blue and white uniform, and from the
flutter of a cap that she wore even unto
the hem bf her apron she was as brisk
ly dainty as a feather-duster soubrette.
"Come to my ward after lunch," she
said, and 1 went.
There I saw the thin man. His thin
ness is his fame. It Is the one distinc
tion that his fighting has won for him.
Wispy, with the claws of a bird.

hind the screen. It v.as easier so.
The- assistant, bearing the red cross
of the hospital corps, lounged In a rock-
ing hair. Then v.as nothing that he
could be doing. Two men in the ward
lay waiting to die, but when they have
been bi rvod In every detail that physician
and nurse can direct, then there is no use
disturbing one's self. Death is a very
commonplace affair 'â â < the hospital corps.

looms up cheerfully ln every ward from
A to J.
The door opened softly soon after the
doctor had left, and another nurse stole
In. "I'm afraid that boy of yours Is
dying," she wlspered nervously. Riy
nurse and I followed her. <\'l --';'>:
She was a hit frightened, for she had
been given charge of two lsloated cases
that were new to her. We found them
ln a small room behind one of the wards.
The light was turned on brightly, al
though shaded from the two patients'
eyes. The light was necessary, for the
work over their beds was. constant, and
day and night had merged ln their un
knowingnees.
"They are both typhoids," whispered
the nurse. ;:- y.'~*Wp,
She who had directed their care before
approached the one who had alarmed his
new guardian. She laid a steady hand on
his fumbling one. "He ls no worse," she
reassured. *
"Last night they were both delirious,"
she continued. "I had to hold one or the
other in bed all the time. You see they
are not so violent now."
She returned to her ward and I was left.
A small oilstove turned In the room, but
only one sheet was spread over the fevered
bodies of the two men. The one lay with
eyes closed and moaned, moaned without
ceasing. The other plucked with long,
eager hands at the sheets, and followed
me with eyes of glittering glass. l\Z^X'.
The nurse attempted to feed the first
one, but he could not swallow. He was
half conscious of what she was doing.
"Oh, I can't. O Lord! Nurse, don'tâ
nurse, nurse!" , .-^y^'v-J'
His voice died away in inarticulate
groans. ' ryy-x * â 
She worked on patiently. Across the
room the glittering eyes' were fixed upon
me and I could not escape them.
The face that belonged to the eyes was
white with the dull .whiteness of death.
The nostrils were wide and suggested a
skeleton. A straggling growth of black
beard made the face ghastlier.
The eyes and I stared at each other.
They fascinated and terrified. Could they
see? Could they know? I moved back to
the door and still they turned and were
after me. They made me feel huntedâ
guilty.
The plucking and clutching grew fever
ish, then violent. With a summoning of
the paltry little strength left him, the
man started to rise from the bed. The
eyes were still upon me. if-'Z-y'Z
The nurse drew up the knot In a sheet
which was tied upon the bed to gently
hold one prisoner. She crossed the room.
"Lie down again, Mason," she soothed.
"Is there something you want? Let me
get it for you." : *?f ' ,
His little energy slackened and let go.
He fell back. **â  ;W 'Â
"Bring me my clothes," he whined.

"Yes, you shall have lt ln the morning.

"Butâ lâ might beâ stolen"- â
â¢The words mumbled away Into mere
sounds that had no power to give them
selves shape. But the eyes, fearing and
fearful, did not cease their troubled vigil
ance. He was 'not satisfied. zjy^
"I think the sight- of a strange face
worries him," I said.
Shuaderlng, I went out to the quiet
ward and walked the length of it. The
eyes haunted me even to the door. Then
I stepped out upon the great veranda and
felt the cold, clear night air in my face
as I walked, and. the Only eyes that met
me were the clean little twinkling stars.
Out of doors all was- calm and healthy
and sane. , I forgot ' the fever and the
madness within. , *- _
Four o'clock came when I was In th*
crowded typhoid ward at the end ,of the
veranda. Here I found forty men ln all
stages of the disease, except violent de
lirium, with two nurses to attend them.
It Is the only ward that has more than
one, although nearly 400 patients are
within, the walls.
Three lights were burning, for at
tendance was constant. The disease al
lows but little sleep. What sleep there
is breaks repeatedly into sorry waking.
Throughout the room muttering and
calling and whimpering could be heard. .
"What Is It you want, Pierce?" the
nurse asked, her hand pushing back the
tumbled hair of a big, pale boy, who
looked without understanding.
"Peanutsâ oh, bring me ' some pea
nuts!" he fretted.
She laughed cozlly. "When you are
better you shall have them. Rest now,"
she said, stroking the white forehead.
"There Is bathing and plunging to be
done all the early part of the night in
this fever ward," the assistant told me.
"The .water Is made warm at first, then
the temperature is gradually lowered,
and finally Ice Is put in."
The nurse came to me. "There's a con
valescent awake at the other end of the
ward," she said; "No. 36. He wants to
know If our visitor' won't come and see
him. He can't sleep."
A chair was placed for me at the bed
side of a plucky Minnesota youngster,
who saw his fellow-lighters mustered ouc
and away to their northern homes while
he thrashed a fever out in the hospital
prison house.
.. "I'm in cell No. 36." he told me with a
gleam of white teeth, which showed where
a smile could be found ln his dark end
of the room.
"Plucky," I said. There are men who
faced all thai was most terrible in war
and faced it Without flinching; but some
of those very men lie sick and fret as
feebly as babies, while others storm
curses of impatience that a six-handed
nurse couldn't quench. Still others are
meekly grateful. But the Minnesota
youngster, was none of these." He was
just jolly, good-natured, no more nor
less: while discreet care tantalized his
returning appetite with a milk diet that
many a veteran would never take humor
ously. Xvi;' ..:'-'
"They won't let me even sit up yet,"
he said, "after all these weeks. I was
sent up in the first place for two days,
and here I am. But I'm going to leave"
for home in three weeks. The nurses are
all right, but a follow wouldn't mind
seeing his mother when he's laid up like
this." Z'{y'Zx.
And I'll wager that his mother wouldn't
mind seeing a fellow when he's the kind
that that one is. It's a ringing good cheer
that he'll carry back to Minnesota, and
here's luck to the trip! ;'- . - .. . .
"I can't sleep ln the morning," he ex
plained. "You hear how this noise keeps
up all over the ward. , That one calls and
swears and the next jabbers all kinds of
nonsense, and that one sings a lot of
the time." '?.
A queer, unearthly chant suddenly rose
from one of the heapy beds. It was a
weird noise in the night.
The boy talked on with the hurry that
belongs to an Invalid. He rambled over
Manila and he branched off to cam
paigns. He talked of waiting and of ac
tion and told of a night when twenty
men and their lieutenant slept- on a wet
nillside with blankets for beds and
a fog for roof. He laughed a feeble
but sunshiny little laugh when he re- *
called how they had lain together like
spoons In a case for warmth and how
they had been obliged to turn simultane
ously and "spoon the other way" when
one man had to . relieve his cramped
position.
By the time that 5 o'clock came the
lights were turned out and a crafty glim
mer of gray morning stole in. I passed
on to another ward, where I watched the
day come.
In the ghostly light a dark figure was
sitting wrapped in an overcoat. "Why
Is that man not In bed?" I asked.
"Heart disease," replied the nurse.
"He has not lain down all night. It
hurts him. He always sits."
He leaned forward gloomily, half asleep,
half suffering. y',l's<\-

There was a ripple and rustling of wak

up and call for the nurse. They wanted
egg nogs and milk punches, and they had
them. The diets are of throe classes:

Five million souls united in a welcome to
one. Three million persons saw the center
of all human interest. Seven miles of
boats escorted the hero up the Hudson
River on Friday, September 29. Seven
miles of humanity- cheered him through
the city on Saturday, the 30th. Caesar
himself had never a more triumphal re
ception In a more Imposing Betting. >.v :
Meanwhile New York was aglow with
patriotic color. It was rainbowed. It was
a forest of Hag-poles. A sea of flags, me
dallions and festoons of bunting. Five
million Deweyites helped make it so. The
6,000.000 would have made a line 2000 miles
long. Put one behind the other in lock
step, they would have reached from New
York to Salt Lake . City. Marshaled in
6000 regiments and marching company
front, forty-two men abreast, they would
have required twenty-one days to pass in
review before Dewey, marching day and
night. This mighty army would have been
kali miles long and would have reached
from- New York to Fort Wayne, Ind. If
all the flags used by this army on Dewey
day could have been sewed together, the
result would have been a mastodonic af

What did It mean to have 2,500 vis

Fifth avenue was like the congested cor

from the messroom. This was for the
regulars. The "lights" had the least
hearty of it, and the specials were pro
vided fur by the nurse in the ward
kitchen.
There was a universal stir at last.
Breakfast, dressing and the morning
papers started the- day. From the bacK
of the ward came the singing and twitter
ing of canaries. >p
"Those belong to my bird man, tne
nurse said. "He brought them from the
Philippines and the bamboo cage comes
from Japan. They sleep under his bed
at night. You see they are on his table
now to keep him company."
An assistant came down the room with
a full tray. "The bird man won't eat.
He doesn't like any of the breakfast,
the assistant reported.
"Tell him to eat hi? birds," somebody
said. Never mind who, for the who
didn't mean it. "Tell him we'll see what
can be done for him." was the order
given.
A fretful voice at the front called for
help. The Invalid wanted to sit up, and
two men worked to make a prop of a
slanted chair and many pillows.
"It doesn't feel right. The chair la
too high. There, you've got It too low
now," he fumed. "My head aches. I
always have a headache in the morning.
I want my face washed."
"Walt a few minutes."
"I, can't wait. I tell you I want my
face washed. Say, you, don't you want
to wash my face?" appealing to a con
valescent who was sitting near, having
made a shaky toilet by himself.
"I guess I might try it," was the doubt
ful reply. ;--Â».:
"All right. He'll bring a basin and you
wash my face. Here, hurry, bring a
basin. I don't like to wait." -.;*,
Away from the fumes of carbolic and
the peevish voices that whimpered, the
little white tents had turned gray In the
gray hour. The first car halted and a
raft of soldiers left lt. I entered. There
- were two soldiers toppled in a heap
against one another, who did not leave
the car. They were sleeping the deep
sleep of Sunday morning.
"Walt till 1 wakes up me lodgers," said
the conductor.
He shook them. One started and

"What's the matter of you? Who ever

ALTHOUGH "baker's bread" has be-
come a standby in most modern
household? there arc yet many
who cling to "homemade" bread
with the tenacity of an undying
faith. True, In many ruses, the domestic
article, for various reasons.' is not nearly
bo pleasing or satisfactory as is the prod
uct of the professional breadmaki but
we feel that there are no awful mysteries
about its mixing and makeup and that
everything which went into It and that
it went Into In Its process of transmogri
fication from raw material to manufac
tured product was clean and excellent of
Its kind.
It is a lamentable fact, though, that a
large proportion of the "homemade"
bread of civilization is utterly unfit for
human consumption. Otherwise charming
and estimable women will place upon
their tables sour, heavy, gray, hard
crusted and generally abominable mix
tures of flour, and various other ingredi
ents, and expect the assembled family
and guests to eat and be thankful, be
cause, forsooth, the concoction was
evolved in their "own "kitchens."
There is no excuse for any housekeeper
in the matter of bread, for it is the sim
plest of all things to evolve in a whole
some, appetizing and pleasing shape.
Good materials and a little patient and
intelligent care are all that are needed
to make this branch of domestic science
an unqualified success.
The uncertain "rule of guess" must
never be applied to any of the articles
made from grains of any description. Ex
actness in measurements, proportions and
time must characterize the whole process
of bread, biscuit or hot-cake making, and
if this exactness be rigidly adhered to the
youngest girl experimentalizer may be
sure of making even from her very first
efforts an unqualified success.
The art of making bread comes to us
from antiquity. ;V
Its first mention ls ln Genesis. xviii:s,
when Abraham, wishing to entertain the
three angels on the plains of Mamre, of
fered to "fetch a morsel of bread," and
Sarah was instructed to "make ready
quickly three measures of line meal,
knead it and make cakes upon the
hearth."
At a later period great perfection In the
art was attained in Egypt, a country
which then took the leau in all the arts
of civilisation.
Its march was next into Greece and fre
quent allusions to this subject are made
by Its classic authors. At least sixty va
rieties of bread were known to the an
cient Greeks, formulas and minute de
scriptions of many of them being given.
Pliny's history tells us that bakers were '
Introduced into Rome during the reign of
Perseus, King of Macedon. Public bak
eries were distributed throughout the city,
and slaves were compelled to perform the
heavier and more disagreeable parts of
the labor. These institutions were regu
lated by the Government, and a special
public magistrate was appointed to attend
to all matters pertaining thereto.
In England and throughout the United
Kingdom, during the middle ages, the
calling of the baker was considered a very
Important one. It became necessary In
England In 12G6 to enact ln Parliament a
law regulating the price of bread, which
system continued ln the city of Donuon
till 1Â£22, and in the rest of the country till
1838.
In 1812 bread was made in Sweden, but
in small cakes mostly, loaves being used
only by the higher classes of Inhabitants.
Among many of the rural people of Swe
den and Norway no bread is used to this
day, except rye cakes, baked nearly as
hard as flint, and made only twice a year
Loaves of bread were "hardly known
among the farming people of Scotland
one hundred years. ago. Barley bannocks
and oaten cakes were used among all
classes.
In Palestine, as well as ln other parts of
Asia Minor, bread is baked dally in out
door stone ovens, each family having Its
own mill, in which they grind the grain
that is to be used. This custom has con
tinued without change for more than
eighteen centuries.
A kind of bread known as the "Austra
lian damper" is used in many European
countries, the dough of which; composed
of flour, salt and water, Is baked over the
dying embers of a wood Are, lying on a
flat stone. Passover cakes used by the
Jews in their religious feasts are prepared
from a similar dough.
France has done much to perfect the
art of bread making by the Invention of
valuable machinery, and it is conceded
by good Judges that the best bread made
In Europe ls produced by the bakers of

Veeloulated bread includes such kinds

IN REGARD TO KNEADING BREAD
âWooden kneading boards are declared
unsanitary. In their place in the modern
kitchen are found heavy marble or glass
trays, which are more easily kept clean
The molding board is now declared to h'
one of the places where close inspection ;
needed by housewives who appreciate th,
Ã¼biquitousness of germs and microbes. Irt

of these up-to-date housekeepers. Doubt-

sugar, one of lard, one tablespoonful salt
and one and one-half pints warm milk.
Stir into flour and knead ten minutes. Let
rise to twice its size, knead five minutes,
let rise again, knead ten' minutes, and
form into two loaves. Let rise thirty
minutes and bake in moderate oven three
quart, of an hour.
TWO LOAVES PERFECT BREAD-

center and. pour In the milk and yea*-*;.
Work in gradually the flour with the
hand. If not too soft sprinkle with a little
flour and knead well. Set to rise in a
warm place, well covered, two hours in
summer, four In winter. When risen to
twice Its size knead down again.* Let rise

slowly one-half pint of boiling water. Add
this to the potato and water; when luke
warm add the yeast and let rise. When
well risen stir down and le*l. rise fgain.
Put in glass cans and set in a cool place.
' The morning 'of baking warm the flour,
and If the yeast is very cold take the
chill off. Wet the flour with one-half the

UTENSILSâ A deep frying , pan 'â¢ and a

needed. . The pan should be of heavy tin,

handles; the wire basket, a very useful
utensil, of tinned or aluminum wire.
I heartily recommend the use of a wire
basket for frying, as it enables you to din
the food in without splashing and to take

or STORIES
By Prof. H. B. Lathrop,
Stanford University,
N "Stalky & C 0.," Rudyard Kipling's
new book of stories, appear . many of
the fine qualities which we have
learned to expect In Rudyard Kip-
ling's work; energy, ingenuity, in-
clslvenesÃ, swiftness, brilliance. The
>ook affords another sample of the com
pleteness with vhich Mr. Kipling has
Â»ntered into the subject with which ha
deals, of rather of the completeness With
which it hrs entered Into him. His mind
seems, as it were, to be saturated with
the life he portrays, so that everything
ls done with an unconscious right

Tliey are extraordinary, not to say ab
normal youths, quite too artificial! suc
cesfui In the jokes on the iters and
others which constitute the plot* of th*Â»
littlo tales. The book Is an amusing one,
and would be read with unsuspecting en
joyment if Mr. Kipling would only leave
his readers alone with the idea that it
Is meant for fun. No rational man need
worry himself about Kipling's limitations
and Imperfections unless he must. He Is
good ln his way; why concern ourselves
With his exaggerations, }*,:Â« hardness, his
lack of delicacy and tenderness? We can
find ln others what he lacks, a3 we can
find lr, him what others lack. We need
not take him aa an apostle.
But Mr. Kipling insists on being an
apostle. He begins his tales of schoolboys
witii a solemn nie-ralizing poem: he ends
with a story ln which one of the charac
ters plays a heroic, part on the Afghan
borders, empl'iying against the Pathans
a stratagem of which he had made use at
echool against the master. The moral is
obvious. By heroic irregularities and up
standing against superior authority at
schoe)l boys are made into Mr. Kipling's
highest type of heroesâ otlicers In Afghan
wars. Mr. Kipling preaches, he avows
that he preaches, he insinuates preaching
ites preaching
Into the minutest crevices of his narra
tives. Now, lf a man sets up to preach,
he must expect to be criticized as a
preacher. And If it Is through works of
fiction that he tries to teach a moral les
son the whole spirit and tendency of his
writing must be carefully scrutinizedâ the
more rigidly the more effective his writ
ing may be.
What, then, ls the philosophy of life
the phllosonhv of life
which Mr. Kipling puts forward? Its fun
damental principle Is the glorification of
action which produces tangible results.
Its models of human perfection are men
who do efinite, palpable thingsâ sailors,
engineers, above all soldiers. The man
of thought, the student as such, appears
in Mr. Kipling's work onlj to be scorned.
At school he is pale, high-browed, in
effective: in the business of life he is
contemptuously put aside by the man of
action or Is secretly envious of him. Mr.
Kipling has no laurels for the man of ideas
or for the scholar as such; for the philoso
pher, the antiquarian, the historian, the
scientist. Less contemptible are news
paper reporters, novelists an * poets of
action, who are at least attached to the
army of doers, though only as camp-fol
lowers. But the only real hen are the
men who perform tangible, calculable, def
inite achievements if with a good deal
of physical activity, so much the better.
Mr. Kipling's ethics are as naive as those
of a: old Norse or Anglo-Saxon poet. His
glorification of achievement, of physical
activity, of strife; his scorn of contempla
tion, of Indoor life, of abstract ideas, differs
ln nothing from the same things In primi
tive writers, who sing of the sea and of
battle, and who pray not to have "a lied
death, a priest's death, a cow's death."
This faith in action for its own ike Is
associated closely with the peculiarities
of Kipling's style, which make it somehow
questionable in spite of its brilliance.
Kipling's style is more than normally
eharp in its deflniteness. lt ls exaggerated,
it shows an indifference to the means
used for effect provided the effect is
gained; it is slangy, it is often grotesque.
Very clear and simple Ideas are gained
by suppressing all modifications and limi
tations, by having one point of view, by
Feeing only one side of a question or one
thing at a time. The neglect of all
phases of an Idea or Impression except
that at the moment essential is the source
of Kipling's whole-hearted force, but it
Implies a limitation of mind and a habit
of exaggeration. It Is plain that a man
In love with action will find such a style
congenial. Modification, limitation, bal
ancing between a little more or a little
less, produces hesitation; it may some
times produce an unreadiness to act at
all. The style which tries to follow the
exact truth, to limit, to suggest associa
tions, to shadow forth Ideas not easily
to be apprehended, has a certain rela
tionship to the typical scholar's frequent

gJSHOP POTTER sat upright in the
cuddly chair of the hotel parlor.
The chair tempted, but he fore-
bore. He does not relax tension,
It seems.
He was gray of temple and gray of lip.
The features of his face were as precise
in outline as a young man's, but the face
was very, very weary. It seemed to say,
"Bo much trouble in the worldâ so much
trouble, always trouble."
But the voice rang clear and firm still.
Its tone resounds, "Let us sweep away
the trouble; let us bring cheer." The
first impressions of the man are as full of
contradictions as aro those of any man

by the absence of dates, and by the im

Shoemaker should have felt called on for
a higher flight when he reached Manila.
He entered the town when the American
troops were first occupying it, and was
present ,at the outbreak of hostilities
with the Filipinos. Under the circum

him to deliver an opinion as to the po

"A First Glance at the Birds." by
Charles A. Keeler of the University- of
California, is intended to be an introduc

of California, and serves as a prelimi
nary to a larger work on California biros,
to be entitled "Bird Notes Afield. Mr.
Keeler has followed the plan of taking
up the various more common birds of the
State in a classified order, mentioning
such details about them as would strike
the attention or provoke the interest of
the general reader, and adding Informa
tion by which the species might be dis
criminated. He has tried to avoid the ap- .
pearance of scientific dissertation, and to
give the whole that emotional and poetic
interest which is felt by all who havo
watched living birds in their haunts

dreary for a baby bird, yet here where

wind ceaselessly blowing, in some cranny

solitary egg and rears her lonely little

himself to the conveying of such impres
sions as the sharp-eyed but unscientific
observer might receive, his touch is un
faltering; but In the attempt to communi
cate instruction which, however general.
is really scientific, Mr. Keeler comes to
grief. The task, as be himself says, is
Impossible. The classification becomes a
mere tedious list, and yet it does not pos

details chosen for Identification are at
times such as the unscientific reader can
not perceive. The whole discussion of the

The failure to maintain a definite point
of view, either of the scientific or of tha
unscientific bird-lover, makes the essay
unequal and awkward. Now it is science.
now literature, now neither, and the re
sult is disquieting and confusing to the
reader. , , .
The attempt to put too much informa
tion in has caused one passage to be
seriously misleading. From the para
graph on the Ficarian birds, a reader
would infer that all cuckoos, kingfishers
and humming birds resembled woodpeck
ers In having two toes directed forward
and two directed backward. The miscon
ception which would result from this
loosely written paragraph would seriously
embarrass a beginner.
Although it must be admitted that Mr.
Keeler has not fully attained his Immedi
ate ohject. vet he has written an essay
containing charming passages and written
as a whole in a charming spirit. If he
could feel that science being out of the
question it should be rejected completely,
and if taking the attitude of a sharp
eved unscientific lover of birds he could
write many such passages as those about
the puffin." he would make a book of true
and precious poetry. (Elder & Shepard,
San Francisco, 30 cents).
Readers with a tinge of booklshness will
find In the "Etchingham Letters" delight
unalloyed. They consist of a series of
letters supposed to be written by a brother
and a sister, two highly cultivated persons.
members of a good English family. The
brother's part is taken by Sir Frederick
Pollock, the sister's by Mrs. Ella Fuller
Maitland, the wife of the eminent profes
sor of history. Like good letter 'writers
they never pose, and they, do not write
dissertations. They touch cleverly, and
with a lightness which is not inconsistent
with real seriousness, on all sorts of
topicsâ family matters, London smoke, the
criticism of Tennyson, the war with Spain,
Anglo-Saxon and East Indian curses,
Wagner, the upsetting of a bicycle-rider
by a dog, and old Scotch songs. The
book Is clever throughout, without effort
or mechanical wit. What better criti
cism could a lady give to the author of a
book of erotic poems than this?â " Put
your mind at rest; you have made it clear
to mo that you have no prejudice against
sin, and you may as well let the subject
drop." And what prettier words could
an absent brother receive from a sister
than: "rThe birds] send you a message:
'In thought we gently ruflle ourselves
against Sir Richard's hand." Trelawney,
cat of my heart, on nearlng this, and not
to be outdone in dutiful affection, said:
'When I think of Sir Richard I purr in
voluntarily.' " One of a â¢ dozen bicycle
proverbs Is worth quoting "The Inches
of our gear are three score and ten; and
though there be some so strong that they
ride four score, yet is their speed but
labor and sorrow at the day's end, when
they fetch their wind short upon an hill."
These letters, with their background of
devoted patriotism, their breadth of
knowledge, their sense of the family
union, their sanity, may well balance some
other views of English life which are pre
sented to us. The authors draw fearlessly
on their readers' bank of knowledge, quot
ing right and left. Sir Frederick -gives a
few choice passages of Hindustani with
out a translation. They do not bite, but
they take ycur breath away. (Dodd,

Most of man's appetites are acquired.
If he has not acquired them himself they
were acquired for him by his progenitors.
The first human being took at once to
milk, fruits, vegetables, meat. Through
heredity and habit how many other things
a human being does take to now! There
are few men who cannot remember what
a time they had in learning to cat oys
ters, to smoke and chew, or to drink.
It Ib just as true that the lower animals
have secondary appetites as that man has
them. To Illustrate, out of my own ob
servation, the truth of this statement, I
came to the rectory one day with a puppy
ln my bent arm. I am fortunate In that
the advent or an animal of any sort In
my house is as welcome an event to the
Supreme Authority, in that house as it is
to me. . i ,- -

puppy in the kitchen and went to my
study. An hour later I was called. When
I reached the kitchen. "See there!" ex-
claimed the Authority. ; What I saw was.
the puppy, its ears back, its stubby legs
apart.. Its tail- wagging, clumsily eating
potato salad :.t rom a saucer.
The Authority told me that she had
had the puppy In her arms at a side ta
ble on which sat the things which were to
be served at dinner; that to her surprise
it had sniffed longingly in the-'directlon
of the salad, and that Its having a sau
cer of that viand was the result. The
friend who had given me this puppy was

Baron Sedgemere is one of the famous
litter by Stockwell, ex-Champion Black
berry, born In 1895, which also Included
Champion Boaz, G. R. Sims' well-known
Barney Barnato and Baroness Sedgemere.
The Baron ls a lightweight, and is a red
dog with a .white chest marking he 1*
a German. The puppy had acquired the
â¦German taste for vinegared and mustard-
ed things. :- y_*:;-.ir X
This puppy attached himself to me at
once and completely. The time was sum-
mer, and I frequently went to the side-
board for a drink. When I took a drink
the puppy always wanted one.
This was not surprising when I took
water. But I did not always drink water.
I sometimes took a glass of some soft
stuff. The puppy always wanted some of
whatever I drank. I provided a Mttle tin
pan for him. that he might he gratified.
and that I might have a drinking com-
panion. At first he did not. like sarsapa-
rilla,- and the way. In which he spat out
his first mouthful of ginger ale was
laughable. Before the first summer of
his association with me was ended, how-
ever, he had thoroughly; formed the per-
dicious soft drink habit.
And he had formed another habit. The
gentleman who gave him to me was a
Â-rewer. This gentleman showed his re
gard for me In many ways. There came
one day a case of beer from him to the
rectory. Whether I would have drunk
that beer had my stomach been In order
it is not necessary for me to say. The
fact Is that I did not drink much of It.
F did not want to offend the giver by
returning the case. The contents of two
or three bottles went into the sink.
But more than once. I tasted the beer.
This meant that the puppy got some of it.
At the first taste he liked it better than
he did the ginger ale or the sarsaparilla.
This awakened a suspicion In my mind.
Inquiry developed the fact that he had
frequently tasted beer before he came to
me. I poured no more beer Into the sink.
More than once the 'young dog came to
me and took me to the sideboard and
begged me for a drink. Once he brought
his growler to the study In his mouth.
That that dog got at least as much beer
as was good for him I need not say.
I have a story -sent to me from a cor-
good all round, and his head ls one that
certainly has never bean surpassed. His
large and phenomenally wrinkled square
skull, with Its great length from eye to
ear, his magnificent turn-up and lay
back, fill the heart of every bulldog fan
cier with envy and admiration, and, look
ing at him, no one 'can' wonder at his al
most unbeaten record. ' - "â â  22X j Z

I saw not long since a very large and yery red-nozzled horse.
I had seen the driver and the horse before. â¢ They belonged to

As to the horse, he walked lumberingly. He was cvi-

I have had the pitcher plant under eye a good deal.
It Ib well known that this plant is carnivorous. Cer-

sweet Juice which is very intoxicating. Were these
insects not fond of the intoxicant they, of course,
would not be attracted by it. I received, some
months ago, from New Orleans, an account of

Suddenly he pausedâ an idea had occurred to
him. Dashing across the hall, he sped into my
dressing room; a small tub of water was on the floor
near the washstand; he drank about a quart of It, then
returned looking calm and serene, and stretched himself
down on the rug for rest and repose after his unusual ex-
cltement. Mis serenity was of short duration, however.
At first a meditative and then a troubled look gradually
f stole over his countenance. Presently, with ears and tall
erect, he was once more racing around the room at full speed,
and then, as before, he fled to my dressing room and drank
another quart of water and returned wit a countenance less
serene and hopeful, and tried once more to rest and sleep. This performance
