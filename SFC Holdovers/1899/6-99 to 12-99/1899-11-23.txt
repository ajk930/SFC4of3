of destroying the bridge at Wes
; tor. Should this be accomplished
: the Boers would be free to turn
: their attention again to Kstcourt
i and later join the investing forces
about Ladysmith.
The Boer report that General
Hiklyard's messenger asking
General White for assistance was
captured causes some uneasiness,
but it is argued that if General
Hiidyard had not been strong
enough to hold out he would
â  time ago have been ordered
to retire to Pietermaritzburg.
Therefore small credence is given
the story.
Nothing is known regarding
the food Supplies oi the garrisons
thus isolated. It is believed that
Hstcourt is well provided, but
there is less confidence in the case
of the Mooi River camp.
There is no further news from
the western frontier, except the
list of casualties, showing that
one trooper was killed and nine
were wounded at Kimberlev on
November 16. and confirming
the accounts of the sortie pre
viously reported from Boer
sources.
It was announced from Paris
that Colonel Yille de Roise Ma
reuil. a French officer, has ac
cepted the post of chief of staff
to Genera] Joubert in succession
to Colonel Schniel, the German
officer, who was wounded and
taken prisoner at Elands Laagte.
From the same source it is re
ported that the Russian officers,
Lieutenant Colonel Gonetzki of
the Guards and General Zeletzi
of another crack Russian regi
ment, have resigned and are go
ing to join the Boers.

CONSUL MACRUM
WAMS TO LEAVE
WASHINGTON. Nov. a iitea stata*
Consul Ma, rum at Pretoria has asked the
State Department for leave of absence,
with. permission to take advantage of It
at once. He pleads domestic reasons for
leaving his post and offers to place in the
consulate as the representative, of the
United States Vice Consul Attlebury. who
is now on the ground. The department,
; however, refused to accede to the request,
and Mr. Ma. rum will stay where he Is.
unless he Fees fit to quit his post without
mission.
ii Is learned that so far Mr. Ifaormn haÂ«
not been prohibited by the Boer Govern
ment from caring for the welfare of the
British subjects now in the Transvaal and
the Free State, or at least he has not
so notified the State Department. There
has be<>n some friction encountered in the
effort of the British Government to secure
permission for the United States Consul
to disburse funds for the benefit of the
British soldiers here as prisoners of war.
PROVISIONS FROM
AMERICA ARE GOOD
LONDON, Nov. B.â Various officers of
the British Admiralty have been inter

bad beef assertions, and they say they
have not received a sinple complaint as '

TALKS OF THE WAR
KBTW YORK. Nov. 22-John Hays Ham

prominent during the Jameson raid In the
TransvHal, arriveÂ«i here on th>- White

day. Mr Hammond was met at the
steamship pier by many people, some of
whom came from as far as Chicago, In

â aid:
"There can be no doubt that European
sympathy In peneral is with the Boers.
It in not no much for the reason that they
love the Boers as that they dislike the
EnÃlish. It is likewise that the animosity

her friendship for us durlnp the Spanish

they were invited to go by the Boer Gov

and that when they immigrated the exist
ing laws were very, favorable to the Ult
landers. It was only after their capital
and labors had rescued the Transvaal
from Imminent bankruptcy that the lib

adverse laws.

CHARGES AGAINST RUSSIA'S
MINISTER OF FINANCE
M. SERQE DH WITTH. Russian Minister of Finance.
M. de \VlttÂ« Is. perhaps, the mrn-t powerful and Influential man In the
Czar's service, not even excepting tho Foreign Minister. Count Muravleff.
Only a year ago the Czar Issued a â  bile rescript Thanking: him for his ser
vices an<l appointing him BecrctAry of State. The Crar has absolute confi
dence In his proved Integrity and sterling honesty. M. de Wltte's rise from
a position In the lower walk of life has been a most remarkable one. He has
had a career which has few parallels In the history of the world. Twenty
years ago he was a more village, statlonmaster <m the railroad line from
Klwve to Odessa, and he Is Indebted for his rapid rise and promotion to the
fact that on one memorable occasion ho disobeyed orders. He had received
certain Instructions with regard to the transportation of troops to Bulgaria,
and rinding that compliance therewith would have resulted In hopeless con
fusion he took upon hlnrn-lf to act In direct opposition thereto. Called to
account for hi? dlsooedlence. ho was able to prove to the satisfaction of
his hupcrlors that he hud acted â â¢ thf only manner certain to be successful,
and that the orders transmitted to him were entirely wrong. This attracted
the attention of M. "VVychnrgradski. who was at that time president of the
railroad on which M. de Witte waÂ« employed. On Wychnegndski becoming
Minister of Finance he brought tin* young statlonmaster with him to St.
reterrbuig. where he rapidly promoted him from one post to another, until
seven y.ttrs ago he succeeded him as Minister of Finance.
B2T - The Dc^taeba Z eltur.R to-day publlnhes the following dis

the allocations that M. <1e Wltte (presumably the Minister of Finance) haa

CALL HEAPQfARTERS. WELLING
TON Hmtel. WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.-
Admirul Dewey has no regrets to express
or apolopie.- to I n.r for the disposition he
hae made of the home presented to him
by the American people. When 1 saw him
to-alght he was pleasantly chatting with
a caller and seemed in the best of spiri*. s.
He had received a large number of tele-
.^rftraa front all parts Â«f theâ country ex
pressing satisfaction with the course he
had pursued and condemnation of the crit
1 lama to which he had been subjected.
He regards these expressions as coming
from his true friends and Is deriving much
comfort from them. The admiral does not
wish to make any further explanation,
but desires it understood that he stands
by the Interview which he gave last night
after he. had learned of the full extent
Of the criticism which his action had
caused.
"You may say," the admiral said to me,
"that the interview which I gave last
night la correct in every particular, and
that I am entirely satisfied with the posi
tion 1 nave taken. Further than this, I
ii. us; nut talk lur publication. 1 have ad
mitted to beverai others to-night that this
interview was correct, and it is possible
that they muy take advantage of this to
write further extended Interviews with
me, but they will not be Justified in doing
t>o. 1 have said all that 1 am going to
tay for publication."
In conversation with other friends the
admiral freely admitted to-day that in
transferring his bouse to Mrs. Dewey he
had her uione in mind; that he had
thought that he could make her no more
titling weaning present than the homo
In wr.ich they were to live, and that he
did nut then contemplate a further trans
ter of the house to his eon George. Tne
decision to do so was reached by Mrs.
Dewey au.l the admiral heartily approved.
The: is no doubt that Admiral Dewey
feels that much ol the criticism which ha.*
endued from his action comes from tho^o
who feared that he had political ambi
tions. This intimation was thrown out
by his brother-in-law. Mr. McLean, last
night, and it was repeated again to-day
by some of Admiral Dewey's dose
friends. One of them even went so far
us to Ml that if It were kept up the ad
tr.lral might, alter all. find it desirable to
filter the Presidential race. But it may
be stated authoritatively, regardless of
the Suspicions the admiral may have as
to the Presidential motives behind the at
tacks upon him. that nothing whatever
could tempt him to enter politics. The
admiral's sole desire, as he expressed it
to trial to-night, is to bo allowed to live
as quietly as possible. He is becoming
very weary of the social attentions which
are being heaped upon him, and it is
probable thai he and Mrs. Dewey will
take a trip in a few days to some quiet
place for an indefinite stay.
Georgo Goodwin Dewey, Admiral Dew
ey's son, to-day became the legal owner
of the much-talked-about house. The
deed by which Mrs. Dewey made this lat
est transfer was filed for record this
morning. It sets forth that the prop
erty is transferred by Mildred McLean
Dewey and George Dewey, her husband.
of the city of Washington, D. C.,' to
George G. Dewey of the city of New York.
The consideration named In th* deed Is
$10. The transfer Is made subject to this
condition, which Is Inserted in the deed:
"Subject, however, to this expressed
ration: That the parties of the first
part do hereby expressly reserve to them
selves and to each of them during and
for the period of their natural lives, re
spectively, a life Interest in and to the
premises therein described Such life in
terest In case of the death of either of
the parties of the first part to revert to
the other."
As it costs Admiral Dowry $50 for In
ternal revenue stamps every time the
house is transferred the Government has
profited to the extent of $150 by tho fro
auent transfers. The admiral might have
saved $100 of this amount if lie had simply
transferred tho property directly to his
son in the first place without passing it
through the hands of Mr. Crawford and
Mrs. Dewey.
The criticisms of Admiral Dewey for
transferring the title of his residence to
his wife and Bon continue, but it is ap
parent that a change In public opinion is
setting in and there is a tendency to-day
to express sympathy for th*Â» admiral, who
has been made tO feel that a single mis
take in Judgment may completely over
turn a popular hero. In his desire to be
stow a wedding gift upon his bride Ad
miral Dewey lost 6lght of the fact that
he could not with perfect propriety treat
the house which had been given to him
as a testimonial of esteem as If it had
been any ordinary piece of property ac
quired in an ordinary way. The nasty
transfer to the son k after the first evi
dence of popular disapproval is taken as
evidence of his desire to condone his of
fense against good ta*te.
RECORD BROKEN ON
THE GREAT NORTHERN
Rapid Trip Between St. Paul and Spo
kane to Make Up for Seven
Hours' Delay.
ST. PAUL, Nov. 22.â Tho Great North
ern claims tho record for the fastest run
on a - Northwestern railroad. An east
bound Great Northern train was delayed
near L*avenworth. Wash., by a land
slide. In the delayed train was some im
portant mall. A special train was made
up of an engine, mallcar and caboose, the
moll was transferred and the train start
ed east. Leavenworth is several hundred
miles west of Spokane.
In the meantime, finding that the east
bound train would not reach Spokane,
another train had started on toward St.
Paul in order to fill the vacancy. So It
became a stern chase. The special east
from Spokane had a start of 210 miles.
The trip of the pursuer to Spokane, 203
miles, was made in four hours and thirty
minutes. The best time was made be
twt-en Wilson and Spokane, 106 miles, in
one hour and thirty minutes. The. pur
si- r came up with the pursued at- Black
foot. Mont., having made up seven hours
of delay.
It was the fastest long-distance run
made by a Western road, the distance
being f(p7 miles.

becretary Evans to-night:
"The Funeral services over the body of
the late Vice President will lie held at the
Church of the Redeemer. Paterson, on
Saturday, November 25, at 2:30 p. in.
"inasmuch as the sauting accommoda
tions of the church are entirely inade
quate It will be necessary that -tuts be re
served for the various national. State and
local officials, representatives of the or
ganizations with which Mr. Hobart was
connected and intimate personal friends of
the family. It is. therefore, impossible to
provide for the general public until vari
ous officials, representatives and friends
have been accommodated.
"Previous to the public exercises on Sat
urday afternoon a brief service will be
held at the Hobart residence only for the
family, the President and his Cabinet, and
Intimate personal friends,
i "On Friday afternoon tho body of the
Vice President will be placed in the 11
brary of his home, where the public may
i have an opportunity to view It. The In
terment will be at the convenience of the
; family at Cedar Lawn Cemetery."
Four companies of regular soldiers from
Governors Island will take part In the
funeral ceremonies and will probably act
I as an escort from the late residence of tho
Vice President to the church. The mili
tary will also act as an escort to President
McKlnley and bis party.

and his Cabinet, the Supreme Court Jus

the heart, due t. myocarditis."
Mr. Hobart was a member of the OrdÂ«r
of Free and Accepted Masons of high
rank, a thirty-third degree Scottish Rite
Mason, and a Knight Templar. In reply
to inquiries of representatives of various
Masonic bodies It has been explained to
th.m that the family deem it best not to
have a Masonic funeral. Vp to the pres

N. T. Wllcox of Montour was in con

The woman in the caae is Lelah-Puch-

Story Emanating From Oakland Is
Flatly Denied by Southern
Pacific Officials.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 22.â story
emanating from Oakland and published In
San Francisco that the Southern Pacific
shops here would eventually be removed
to the former city is discredited by rail
road ofllcials and every one else conver
s. n\ with the tremendous volume of work
done here, and with the present and fu
ture plans of the Southern Pacific at this
point.
Never before in the history of the shops
were so many men employed as now. The
building* destroyed some months ago by
tire have been replaced by vast brick
structures, and fitted out with the most
modern and costly appliances. The rail
road has entered into negotiations with
the State Board of Prison Directors for
the purchase of cut and crushed granite
from the Folsom quarries with which to
widen its yards and afford more track
room in the vicinity of the shops, and
cars are being turned out in great nurn
i. is. The fact that the company is re
claiming the tide land south of the Oak
land pier is declared to have no bearing
whatever upon the site of the railroad
shops.
H. J. Small, superintendent of motive
power and machinery, and the highest au
thority at the shops, in discussing the
rumor, paid to-day: "The story is with
out foundation. There is no intention of
moving any of the shops from Sacramen

which I have been hearing for the past
ten years or ever since I came here
"The 'work now being done, in Oakland
for the railroad company was inaugu

TOOK A SECOND
WIFE FOR MONEY
Odd Marital Relations of
a San Jose Couple.
Fr*vla.l Dispatch to The Qstt,
SAN JOSE. Nov. 22.â A story of a wo
man's duplicity and the casting of her
love on an ingrate was told in Justice
Rosenthal's court this morning by Mrs.
Charles Wilson when she swore to a war
rant charging a man whom she believed
to be her rightful husband with grand
larceny. bile the warrant charging
theft is in the name of Charles Wilson,
the man wanted Is Nick Infantino, a bar
ber, who has been leading a dual life.
Most likely a charge of bigamy will also
be lodged against him.
Infantino has been employed for the
past year by an undo of the same name
in a barber shop at 52 Eldorado street.
About six months ago he met the woman
who is now known as Mrs. Charles Wil
son in Oakland. She was employed as a
domestic there and had saved up a little
over $1000 from her earnings. When In
fantino heard of this bank account he
made desperate love to her. Having a
wife here he went under the name of
Charles Wilson. It now develops that the,
wife was in on the play and encouraged
her husband for 'iii sole purpose of se
curing the money. In July Infantino
married the woman under the name of
Wilson. They came here to reside. From
that moment Infantino tried to get hold
of the woman's money. She refused to
part with it and insisted on their build
ing a little home.
Infantino's first wife was introduced
into the family as Miss Lizzie Stevens, a
cousin. She was a frequent visitor.
Mrs. Wilson furnished the money to buy
a lot at 8 Luther avenue and built a cot
tage there. Mrs Wilson had JfJOO left
with which to make the final payment on
the home.
Yesterday morning Infantino. through
threat of leaving her. made her give him
the $fioo He then went up town. While
Mrs. Wilson was absent during the after
noon Infantino and Miss Stevens, ax his
wife No. 1 was known, went to thÂ« house
and carted away several trunks and boxes
of effects.
The couple then left town on the money
secured. There Is no doubt that Infantino
committed bigamy In marrying the sec
ond time, as "Miss Stevens" was known
about town as Mrs. Infantino. His sec
ond wife he never took out and she knew
him simply an Charles Wilson.
Miss Stevens has also been charged with
being an accessory to the crime of grand
larceny in aiding and abetting Infantino
in securing the Won. Mrs. Wilson refused
to give her maiden name.

OTIS REPORTS ADVANCES
AND A LATE VICTORY

follows:

The dispatch from General Otis dues not
yet make it appear that the efforts to
capture AKuinaldo and the larger portion
of his army will be successful. The In
tention of General Young to prevent
Agulnahlo reaching Bayombong seems ev

SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF
WOUNDING THEMSELVES
WASHINGTON. Nov. 22.-Self-lnfllcted
wounds are so frequent In the American
army in Luzon that General Otis has been
compelled to issue Instructions directing
that a strung investigation be made In
each case of this character in onior that
proper action may tÂ» taken. The im

The results of the investigation have not

The Issuance of General Otis' instruc

are the results of this communication ad
dressed to the adjutant general of the
Department of the Pacific Coast by the
chief surgeon:
"Self-Inflicted wounds of the hand, and;
occasionally of the feet, claimed to be
accidental, usually occurring on the out
posts, are so frequent that I have the
honor to suggest thnt all such cases be
carefully Investigated by a board of sur

desertion to determine the circumstances
under which they actually occurred. All
these men became disabled for military
duty, with usually a minimum amount of

BRITON INSPECTS
SUBMARINE BOAT
Praises the Workings of
the Holland.
NEW YORK. Nov. 23-^aptaln Charles
L. Ottley, R. N.. naval attache to her
Majesty'e embassy to the I'nlted States,
came from Washington to-day for the
purpose of Inspecting the Holland sub
marine boat In behalf of hla (kjvernment.
He was taken to the bo:it. whl. 1> Is
moored in the Atlantic Yacht Club basin.
In Brooklyn basin, by John R. Iloliaiid,
who explained the workings of the ves
sel to the captain. For more than two
hours Captain Ottley looked over the
boat. He seamed very much Impressed
with what be saw, and when asked
his opinion he said:
"It Is my Intention to rconmmend to
the Board of Admiralty of the British
Government that It immediately con
sider the merits of the Holland, with a
vi.-w of adopting vessels of her type into
the British navy. She Is to my mind the
most formidable type of submarine boat
and has demonstrated that she Is the only
nucceÃSful one. The vessel could not
only be used In keeping the harbors and
the coasts free from invading fleets but
with vessels of the Holland type there
would need be no fear of submarine mines
or other obstructions to navigation as
she could destroy them readily. l[
my opinion that there Is no question ihat

Dears," a popular but unauthorized ad
junct of the Native Sons of the Golden
West. Henry Harrington Is Insane. He
has been committed to the Stockton
Asylum by Judge Hughes of this county
after an examination conducted by two
leading physicians.
Harrington followed the occupation of
a miner a few miles from Colfax, Placer
County. Ho -Joined the Native Sons and
was prevailed upon to enter the circle of
the "Curl}' Bears." His initiation took
place at * olfax three weeks ago and It
was provocative of the usual hilarity on
the part of the witnesses. It Is not
known how far the "Bears" went In Im
pressing upon the candidate that he was
a duly accredited member, but they must
havo gone pretty far for Harrington has
been Insane ever since. "They are going
to kill me, they are going to kill me." he

To his disordered vision he was being
chased by black cuts and then white OMO,
and all manner of appalling things were
Imminent. The town physicians f.-un.l
themselves, powerless to minister to the
mini! diseased, and so. In the hope that a
change of scene would benefit him he
was brought to Sacramento and lnst-ille.l
In the home of hi* married sister. He
became no better, however, and the other

the aid of a hat pin Finally It was de

Harringtons relative* testified at the
examination that after his initiation largx

was of sound mind.

LAST DAYS
ON LEAGUE
DIAMONDS
This Week Will Bring the
Wind-Up ol the
Season.
The baseball season of 1839. as far as
league games are concerned, will come to
an end on Saturday afternoon, when Sac
ramento meets Santa Cruz at the capital
city and San Francisco the Dudes .â¢ Rec
reation Grounds. Starting out with a six
club league, the mangement decided about
three months ago to cut San Jose and
Watsonyllla out of the race, leaving Sac
ramento, San Francisco, Oakland and
Santa Cruz to finish the most successful
baseball reason on this coast Mnce the
halcy.-n days when the llalght-street
trruu:m> wt-re packed with enthusiastic
crowds twice and sometimes three timed
v. week.
The foundation for a renewal of the old
time spirit has been ... and it will rest
largely wiih the : tent promoters
whether or not a strong superstructure
of baseball Interest can be builded upon
it. Many plans aro running through the
minds of the California League officers for
next season. In all. likelihood there will
bo anotlK r Fix-club league, Stockton and
pome other cityâ possibly Va'.lejoâ repre-
Bentlak the additional two. The grounds,
with tiie position cf the grand stand, will
!>Â«Â» changed and a general overhauling of
.all accommodations will be made during
the winter.
The teams will wind up the season's
work in the following order: Sacramento.
San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Cruz.
By far the best playing throughout the
*.oason has been done by the Senators.
who started the year at the tail end and
forged to the front steadily, until about
four months ago they reached the top of
the ladder, and there they have remained
ever since, with the single exception of
one week, when the local team enjoyed a
brief leading spell. Oakland has 'been
hovering between third and fourth place
for two months, but now seems settled In
the rank above Santa Cruz.
The standing of the teams is as follows:
Per
Played. Won. Cent.
Sacramento Â«8 43 .57(5
San Francisco S5 +4 .517
Oakland v? 41 .400
Santa Cruz SO 23 .437
After the season is closed there will be
a serii-s of games between the California
player? who have returned from the East
ar.d the le.ijrue teams. A game was sched
uled between the California Eastern team
and Sacramento for Thanksgiving day.
but there is now tome doubt whether
these two teams will play. Hughe who
whs to twirl for the Easterners, will not
be found in the box, Johnson or Knell
filling his place. Sacramtnto claims that
it cannot come to this city on Thanks
giving day. as It has a game with a local
team at that time. But if the Eastern
r.inÂ« Is organized San Francisco will prob
ably be its opponent on â¢ November 30.
There seems to be come difficulty in get
ting the EaMern leasuers together, but
Van Haltren and McDonald are working
at it earnestly and have no doubt of cer
tain success.

wus the heft this season. To-morrow the

>aye for Del Monte, where the remainder
of the time will be given to secret prac

Crack Football Eleven May
Visit the Coast This
Winter.
The West and the East. or. rather. thÂ«
West and the Middle West, may meet on
a San Francisco gridiron Muring tho Jast
week of this year. If negotiations which
are now pending between the University
of California football eleven and the I'ni
verslty of Chicago lead to a fruitful u-r
mlnatlon the biggest football match Â»v*r
played on this coast wilt tako place In
this city before th end of the year.
Matters rave progressed to such iataÂ«Â«
that all now depends upon the faculty of
the University of Chicago.
The team representing that university
has accepted the proposition offered by
Manager Uumn of California and will
come to the coast If the Chicago facul

The University of Chicago has been Cast
this year, playing the blggtst of the col
lege teams, defeating many and suffering
defeat from few ami then only after the
severest kind of Â»i gridiron battle.
Once before the University of Chicago
pent a team to this oÂ»>ast. That wa* in
the winter of ON. (iamn were played
with the Reliance and Stanford 'town*
Chicago defeating Stanford In this city
and losing to the cardinal la Los Arm

score. Hut thÂ« team which now repre
sents the Chicago university is fax cif.
ferent from the one which came here In
ISM. This yrar'n eleven Is on the immÂ«
plane with the best In the country ai^l i
game with California would be a te*t of
East against West. All California is anx
iously waiting. for the final answer.
The last week of practice at the uni

are now enjoying complete rest at an
out-of-town resort and will not return to
Berkeley until Saturday. Signal practice
will be all their work from that time un

At Stanford the graduate coaches are
flocking In by twos and threes and all Is
hard brisk work. The team will lenv*Â»

JOE HARVEY'S
FARO GAME IN
POLICE COURT
One of His Dealers
on Trial.
* â
A- an expert at faro Joe Harvey must
be beginning to realize now that he is
"down to case?"â and not easy ones to
boat, eitherâ with his "California Club."
Since The Call's exposure <>f thru enm-
Ming den and the subsequent raid by Po
lice Captain Wittman ar.d Sergeant Shea
not a card has been turned within its
walls and not a bet has beer, cashed, the
entire time of Harvey and his following
Flnce having been consumed In prepara
tion for an effort to double-bank the law.
That effort was made yesterday after
noon in behalf of Asa Hamilton, one of
the *ix men arrested In the celebrated
raid. It failed miserably.
Hamilton, who 1? a dealer In the em
ploy of Harvey, escaped conviction by
the skin of his terth. Ten of th* tweive
men (sworn a.Â« Jurors to try the case be
lieved that he visited the house at 143
Mason street for the purpose of gambling;
Inferentlally they also believed that it
was a gambling den pure and simple and
not a club of equal good reputation with
the Pnclnc Union and other clubs of the
city, as Attorney Jimmi.- I^nit would have
had them believe. Handicapped as he was
by a complaint admittedly defective, sur
rounded as Hamilton was by every point
of the law three lawyers were able to
advance In his defense. Judge Low. the
prosecuting attorney, battled so vigor
ously that he very nearly pulled a victory
out of what seemed certain defeat. The
Jury was not able to agree, but the an
nouncement of their standing. â¢â¢â¢ for
conviction, two for acquittal, must have
found the blowholes even la the locally
Harveyized armor.
James Long did most of the spieling for
Hamilton. Char.'es J. HegKerty and Her
bert Choynski acting as counsel for 'he
defense and doing most of the thinking.
Judge Jx>w wa* alone for the prosecution.
There was a suggestion of faro-banki
ness in this proportion of legal talent, and
Hamilton seemed to have the best of a
time-honored "three-otic-deal." I*ong saw
the advantage of this arrangement to his
client and proceeded at once to whlpsaw
every ruttle out of the box. Be it known,
too. Plnce yesterday . Jlmmle Long is en
titled to be known as the Sherlock Holmes
of lawyer?. The Intuition he displayed in
the selection of jurors showed that. For
example:
"How old are you?" he asked â  pros
pective Juror, whose frame was bent with
the weight of years.
"I am TO years old. sir." was the reply.
"And you have lived in this city how
long?"
"Nigh onto thirty years."
"Ah," exclaimed Long, a great white
light breaking in upon his mind, "ah,
then you must an old resident?"
"Yes. sir meekly acquiesced the Juror
He peremptorily challenged another wit
nfsÂ«, who admitted that he had sold hab
erdashery to Captain Wlttman. an-1 all
through the Hat till twelve had been se
lected he went, emitting many sparks of
similar brilliancy After the Jury had
been sworn In and Long was getting Into
trim to cross-examine when it came his
turn. Messrs. Heggerty and Choynskl
made a discovery not quite so Sherlocky.
They found that while the ordinance,
which it wax claimed had been violated,
read "for the purpose of gambling." the
complaint upon which Hamilton was be
ing prosecuted read "for the practice of
gambling."
l^ong Immediately moved the court to
direct the Jury that the complaint charg
ing no offense they should dismiss the <!â¢â¢
fendant. Judge Conlan overruled the mo
tion and Police Captain Wlttman was
placed on the stand to testify to the dis
coveries he had made at the Harvey
gambling den thÂ« night he arrested Ham
ilton and his five companions. Sergeant
Shea began ; reading out in front of the
Jury the layout, check rack, dealing box
and cases used In the gnme of faro. Long
made a loud objection, and they were cov
ered up for the time being.
Wittman .told how he nad applied for
admittance to the Harvey club and been
refused: how he had broken the chain
on the front door, Bmashed In another
door and came upon Hamilton ad the
others, who were getting away from the
layout.
"I said to one of the men." testified the
captain. " 'Playing a quiet game?* and he
replied, 'Yes. a quiet little game.' Another
of the men, said Wittman. said he was
glad I me. '1 left my girl over at the
Poodle Dog.' he said, 'and came over here
to try and win her a sealskin. The best
I could do was to lose $13. so I'm glad you
came.' " /
â  Wittman al*o testified that he saw one
of the men pass checks over to Dormer
and receive money in return. It was ad
mitted by the defense that Sergeant Shea
and Officer Phillips would corroborate
Wittman. whereupon !<<'iig renewed his
original motion that the case be dis
missed. The motion was overruled and he
made a similar one on the ground that the
complaint had been signed â¢â¢.! E. Barry.
Acting Police Judge." when there was no
such flue under the law. The court de
cided to let the case go to the Jury, and to
the Jury It went after brief argument and
Instructions. The twelve men came into
court after forty minutes, announced
their Inability to agree and were dis
missed. It Is understood that on the nrst
ballot they Flood seven for conviction and
five for acquittal. This was changed on
a late ballot to ten for conviction and two
for acquittal, and there they Btuck.
The ca.<Â»c will he reset for another trial.

The transport George W. Elder returned
to port yesterday, completing th. round
trip to Manila in sixty-one days, the fast
est on record. She sailed for San Fran
cisco a few hours ahead of the Belgian
King, and that vessel will probably reach
port to-night or to-morrow morning. The
Elder comes Into port a credit to Cap
tain Parsons and crew. She is scrupu
lously clean In every department and no
octan liner could be In better order mak
ing port.
The detachment of the Twenty-seventh
Infantry that went 10 the Philippines an?
of the opinion that there is not a better
troopship afloat than the George W. El
der. They presented the captain with a
handsome inkstand of solid silver and h
purse of $150 In gold before leaving the
ship. Th. â¢ inkstand bore the following
Inscription: Presented to Captain E. D.
Parsonjs by the officers or' the detachment
of the Twenty-seventh Infantry, U. S. V..
Hit)." The presentation was made by tho
colonel, and Captain Parsons was so
taken by surprise that he could only
stammer his thanks.
The George W. Elder was taken out by
Pilot "Newt" Jordan on September 22 at.
noon and he boarded her again yesterday
at exactly the same hour. There were
only a half dozen passengers on the
transport, all of whom are clerks coming
home for a vacation. Dr. Williamson, the
veterinary' surgeon who went down on the
ship Tacoraa, also came back. He says
the Tacoma was In the same typhoon as
the Slam, but she escaped with the loss
of her sails. The Slam, however, lost all
her cargo of mules, while the Tacoma
only lost seven during the entire voyage.
This fact Is due to the better accommo
dation provided on the Tacoma, accord-
Ing to Dr. Williamson. He says the
horses on the sailing vessel- suffered very
little, and while over a hundred of them
were Pick leaving San Francisco they
were all In good health when landed in
the Philippines.
Owing: to the vigilance of Alex Craw
quarantine officer of the State Hoard or
Horticulture, a disgusting and tlan^erou*
utPt has been kept out of California. The
Mexican orange maggot has long een a
bugbear to the orange growers of all
fornia. It Is unknown In the United
States, but Is now known to be very prev
alent across the border in Mexico. The
first time it has ever reached herÂ»*. how
ever, was In a shipment of oraiues that
came ben on the steamer Colon from
Acapulco a few days ago. Upon Exam
ining the fruit Mr. Craw found *h.' mag
gots <Try; Ludens* in great numbers.
They make their home in the lip and
are exactly the color of the fruit.
The pest was first discovered in More
los, I(>' miles south of the City of Mex
ico. ai:d it has read within the last
three years until It has rcachod Aca
pulco. The shipment on the Colon was
burned up and Mr. Craw has n..ti: â¢ all
Importers that in no case can ..ranges
from Mexico be landed In California any
more. This notice has been sent to the
freight agents of all railroads in Mexico
and In this way it is hoped to keep the
danger thin bounds.
T. bar was breaking heavily yesterday.
and two attempts made by the pilot boat
Bonlta to get out failed. The overdue
steamers Cleveland, Arcata and Empire
got in and all report very heavy weather
outside.
There Is some fear among shipping men
that the vessel seen bottom up off Flat
tery is the bark Colusa. She left Kahulul
23 days ago for Departure Bay and has
not been heard from since. The passage
is not an unusually long one. but then the
Colusa had been ashore among the islands
and had lost her forefoot and was other
wise damaged. No repairs were made to
her. but she was sent to the Sound In bal
last, and on her arrival was to have been
overhauled.
There is also some uneasiness over the
British bark Nanaimo. now out 106 days
from Chemainus. B. C. for Nagasaki. She
must have met with fomÂ« heavy weather,
and may have lost sol of her spars.
Food Inspector L. W. Holllngsworth
condemned sixty boxes of tomatoes on
Jackson-street wharf. The fruit was un
lit for food and was dumped overboard.
The Harbor Commissioners met yester
day and ordered 100 pil.^s each of H. ii.
Rood & Co.. Paraffin*- Paint Company and
San Francisco Timber Preserving Com
pany. Th. piles were to be used In the
construction of Ferry slip No. 7. Chief
Wharfinger Henderson had referred to
him thÂ«* request of Rear Admiral Krmpff
for a berth for he Unadilla at Clay-street
wharf. The North Central Improvement
Club wrote the board offering Its assist
ance to improve the board's property near
section 1 of the seawall. The club will be
asked to send a committee to confer with
the board.
Seven carloads of chickens, ducks, tur
keys and pigeons from Kansas were land
ed on Lombard street whurf yesterday.
The coast and geodetic survey steamer
Pathfinder put to sea yesterday. She is to
make poundings for the bed of the pro
posed cable between here and Honolulu.
HIGH GfIADE TOURS.
Wonderful Improvement as Compared
With a Few Years Ago.
The best way to go East Is the right
way.
Have you heard of the personally
conducted tourist car excursions to
Cincinnati, leaving San Francisco
every Thursday and Los Angeles every
Friday?
The personal conductors are well in
formed gentlemen, whose* duty it is to
care for the wishes of the passengers,
make the journey pleasant and be of
especial aid to the ladies and children
traveling without escort.
The cars are new (Just from the
Bhops of the Pullman Company), and
are far superior to tourist sleepers pre
viously in use. They have sixteen sec
tions and a smoking room. They are
broad vestibuled and run on steel
wheels with springs that moke easy
riding. The finish is of rosewood, the
windows arc broad and protected with
roller curtains, the upholstering is good
and very comfortable. The light is the
very best- Pintsch gas. The seats are
high backed. The price for a doable
berth in one of these fine new cars is
but 55.50 to Cincinnati. There is no
change of cars between San Francisco
or Los Angeles and Cincinnati, and at
the last named point daylight connec
tions are made for all principal point?
East.
The orange country of California, the
high mesas of Arizona and New Mex
ico, the banks of the Rio Grande, the

BACK HOME TO
TENNESSEE, BUT
NOT AS GUESTS
Muster Out of the
Regiment.
The Tennessee regiment tried to gain
j a day on itself by being mustered out
yesterday instead of to-day, ... was the
original Intention, but there was too
much baggage to be removed and so It
will gain : lit a few hours. Instead of go
ing away this evening about 9 o'clock it
will get away this afternoon at 2.
The change of programme started from
no less an authority than the President
himself. He will be in Nashville next
Tuesday and it was his wish that 'he
regiment be there in time for him to re
view It. It was the wish of the State as
well, so word wab sent out here to hurry
matters even more than they were being
hurried. It was decided Tuesday night
to put the regiment through the muster-
Ing out process yesterday and get away
last night, but that was seen to be impos
sible before the regiment waa half
through with the paymasters. There will
be no delay to-day, however.
Colonel Chlkiers expects over six hun
dred of the men to go home together, but
it is not probable his expectation will
I be realized. The State of Tennessee is
not paying the fares of the men and con
trasting Mils attitude With that of other
States which paid everything has made
the men of the regiment feel they owe
but little more to the home administra
tion.
A few of the men left immediately after
being mustered out, but the greater num
ber will not get away until to-day. The
men received considerably over $100
apiece, for there was four months' pay
coming to them, two earned and two
more from the Government, besides iheir
clothing allowances and travel pay. The
last time they were paid was just be
fore they reached Nagasaki, and when
: they arrived here there was not much
money in the command. Many of the
men owed small sums around town and
that was another reason why the com
mand did not get away. Nobody wished
to leave the town owing debts," and the
suddenness of the muster out made it im
possible for the men to settle up.
Mrs. Tbwnsend offered to come to the
rescue of the regiment with a check for
$'â 0,000. which would take them all home,
but the men declined the offer, at the
same expressing their appreciation of the
motive which prompted it. Their appre
ciation of the kindness of Mrs. Townsend
was more substantially set forth in a
magnificent loving cup presented to her
after the regiment was mustered out.
The going of the Tennessee regiment !
closes the reign of the volunteer In San i
Francisco, at least for a time. Hers Is the
last of the State volunteer organizations
to leave the service, and with the men
from the South pass..* one of the most
picturesque phases of the war. The State
voluntefrt were true . volunteers. They
kicked and complained and consorted with
their officers and were familiar with their
colonels In a way that made the hair upon
the regular heads turn gray, but It needed
only their State cry to rally them and
â end them on regardless of everything.
The volunteers now on their way "to Ma
nila are of a different character. They are
United States Volunteers, recruited 'from
no particular State and officered by men
from all over the country. There is no
State tie binding them; no home associa
tions common to them all. and they know
only so much of each other as they learn
after enlistment. The adventurous sons
of rich fathers are not nearly so numer
ous In the United States volunteers as
they were in the State organizations.
There is not that fellowship between men
rind men and officers and men. They
make, as a rule, better men In camp, but
they will do well if they make better men
when the real work in the field falls to
them.
The Fortieth Infantry will leave to-day
on the Ohio and Indiana. Three hundred
recruits will also go on the Ohio, and this
will dean out the recruit camps. The
Forty-second will leave Monday, five com
panies and the headquarters on the Co

panies on th. Dalny Vostock. The Wye

PRISONER GRAY HAD A
KNIFE IN HIS SHOE
THE FACT DISCOVERED JUST
IN TIME.
Would Not Have Been the First Crim
inal to Have Dug His Way to
Freedom Out of the
Broadway Jail.
Frederick Gray, Indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury for counterfeiting, stole n
knife from the office of the United States
Marshal yesterday, slipped It Into hi*
shoe and took It to thÂ« County Jail with
him. He evidently Intended to use the
weapon to dig his way out of the cell In
the Broadway Jail, and might have sue*
ceeded In his design had It not been for
the vigilance of Office Deputy A. L. Far
lsh and Miss Schrage. the Marshal's sten
ographer.
Just after Gray and his companion.
George Morton, had been taken from thÂ«
Marshal's office on the way to the
County Jail the loss of the knife was dis
covered, and the chief Jailer was tele
phoned that the knife might -be found
upon one of the prisoners. When they
were taken to their cells Gray and Georr*
Horton. his fellow-prisoner, were searchrU
and the weapon was found In Gray'n shoe.
Gray and Horton had been In Unlteil
States District Judge de Haven's court
room for trial on Indictments for coun
terfeiting. The heating apparatus of the
Appraiser's building supplying the court
with the necessary warmth was out of
order, and the Judge, the attorneys, thÂ«
prisoners and the witnesses and the Juror*
got cold feet. Judge de Haven announced
that It would be Impossible to proc<>?<]
with any trial In an apartment so damp
and so chilly as to be dangerous to thÂ«
health of all concerned, and he postponed!
the trial until December I
It happened that a lunch had been takÂ»n
to the prisoners' room In th* Marshal's
office on the preceding lav. and the waiter
had neglected to call tor the tray of
dishes. Among them was a sllvfr-ptated
knife, the one appropriated by Gray.
It was with a similar weapon that Stage
Robber Erlrkson dug his way out of the
Broadway Jail several years ago. and hÂ«
Is still at large. Only a f.-w weeks ago a
counterfeiter In Ism Angelrs stole a table
knife and while on his way to the Jail to
start for his ten years' term In the peni
tentiary cut thÂ«Â» blood vessels of his wrt*ts

ThE MISFORTUNES OF hj-ROES.
FOR one cause or another almost every man who i
achieved tame and popularity in the Spanish war
* and won from the people an applause as tumul
tuous and as rapturous as that which greets a new
pnma donna on the night of her hrst success has lost
the favor of the populace and .become a subject of jest
or of denunciation irom the crowd.
Alger was first to excite a glow of adoration in the
hearts of his countrymen, and for a time he was
hailed as the organiser of victory; but soon came the
s^tory of the embalmed beef and Alger fell. Then i
Hobson arose from the wreck he sunk at the mouth !
of Santiago Bay and for a time was worshiped as the t
b.avest of the brave, but he kissed too many girls and
his glory vanished. Sampson and Schley came forth
out of the battle which destroyed the licet of Cervcra
shining like a radiant pair of brothers in arms, but
they fell out with one another and they were no longer
in it with the people. Shatter for a* season was a
young Napoleon and loud were the plaudits that
greeted his name, but he did not take Santiago in a \
swift eagle swoop and he passed. Otis, arhen he suc
ceeded M err in in the Philippines, attracted attention
and was looked to as the general who was to add a
new luster to American arms, but Otis has ceased to
tatisfy. Roosevelt rode into favor as the rough and ;
ready hero whom we love, but Roosevelt has been
talking too much, and already the people are advising >
l.im to hire a hall. Foremost of them all and greatest â 
' *'f thcr.: a'l was Dewey. He indeed had a vast popu
larity. He was in measurable distance of the Presi
dency, but he took unto himself a wife and transferred
to hrr a mansion a grateful people had just conferred !
upon himself, and immediately his picture exhibited j
at a kincto^cope show was hissed by the audience.
The record i< curious, and is as instructive as '
â¢â trar^c. Popular favor even among a people so well ;
balanced as those of the United States is an uncertain i
thing. A breath may win it and a breath may blast it.
A kiss too much in the case of Hobson, a speech too !
long iti the caÂ«e of Roosevelt and a honeymoon too
*weet in the case of Dcwey. and there ii the end of
the rapture. Yet there was no just cause to condemn
the hero in either case.
Tnily the life of a popular favorite is not a pleasant :
one. To walk along the path of public favor is like ',
walking a slack rope with high winds blowing
around in fitful gusts. If a hero be the favorite and
the leader nf a great political party he can make his
way with comparative case, for his party will back
him up whatever be <]n?< : \ mt t h e non-partisan fa- j
vorite. the nun with whose successes no political !
measure is bound up. has but a precarious popularity
at best. Up to tlm time of all the men who became
heroes of the populace during the war but two have
avoided a fall. Those two arc the old veterans Lee
and Wheeler, nrd it i< to be noted that each of them 1
is keeping himself safely out of the country until the
fickle storm of popularity blows over.
"Mashers- who may have still enough intelligence !
left to read the newspapers will probably take a leaf
from the Look of Julius Rufus and desist from their
insults to the young women and girls of the city. A
good heating at the hands of an irate father and ninety
days in the County Tail, as Rufus got. ought to act
as deterrents on the vile practice for awhile at least
The National Dcmocrac)" evidently does not be

IT has been no secret that England's pretext for de
stroying the two South African republics is a pre

Government monopoly of dynamite and the fran

It will be seen that this scheme
borrowed from the ; Khan and
Tamerlane, and resembling closely the action of
Bonaparte when he was engaged in the vivisection of
Europe with the sword. The natural boundaries of
the Boer states are to be disregarded. Their capitals
are to be abandoned. Their mines are to be taken
away and elsewhere bestowed. As these mines are
already the property of the South African Mining
Company the pretense of opening them to freedom
of working by Europeans and natives is a delicious
bit of hypocrisy. It will be observed that nothing is
said about changing the conditions of the gold mines
of Rhodesia nor of the diamond mines of Kimberley.
In those mines the native blacks are compelled to
work under a system that is but little better than
slavery. The South African Company desired to in
troduce this into the mines of the Transvaal, but were
prevented by the laws of that republic, which are con-*
ceived in a spirit of justice to the Kaffirs. Under all
the circumstances it is to be regretted that this time
is selected for sending an American fleet to Table
Bay. We have no interests there that can be served
by the presence of a squadron nor that justify the
large expense of sending it. In England and in
Cape Colony this act of our Government is at once
construed as a demonstration of approval of Eng
land's war to destroy two republics, and while it is
reported to have caused great enthusiasm and encour
agement in London and at the Cape, it correspond
ingly depresses and discourages the gallant freemen of
the two republics, who, without a friend among tho
nations, are fighting for their birthright with the
courage of despair.

Whenever that mare was missed and he was known to

So when she disappeared he was pursued and caught

hope, for she may have left a colt! So he is out in the
wide world again, making a bee line for Calaveras to
inquire into the family affairs of that oft-stolen mare,
and if she left descendants it is highly probable they
have inherited the tendency to be stolen by this most
remarkable and persistent and peculiar horse thief that
ever adorned the ranks of that risky vocation.
r RANGE'S Parliament gave promise of a sen
sation on Tuesday. Scarcely had the Chamber
of Deputies got ready for business than a Re
publican member arose and asked who had authorized
the display of red flags at the ceremonies in connec
tion with the unveiling of the statue of the republic
on the previous day. He is reported to have added
to his question a little sarcasm in the form of a com
pliment to President Loubet for his tact in turning
his head and looking in another direction when the
red flags appeared.
In reply to the question M. Waldeck-Rousseau
spoke like a statesman who is sure of his ground.
What he said virtually amounted to a declaration that
while the Government had not authorized the dis
play of red flags, neither had it forbidden such dis
play. In fact, the Government is not afraid of the
red flag nor of those who carry it. The demonstra
tion of popular esteem for President Loubet was a
proof the people are not inclined to revolution, and
therefore there is no need of repressive measures
-t persons who like to make a show of revolu
tionary desires. Moreover, he declared, "it is use
to endeavor to excite public opinion by raising
the red flag bogey as was done fifty years ago."
The question and the reply show the temper of
France. There are still a few persons who delight to
wave the red flag in the eyes of conservatism, and
there are still some conservatives who are alarmed by
the waving. The time, however, when the Govern
ment could be frightened has gone by. The present
Ministry neither cares to suppress the revolutionists
I >es it care to use them as a means of frighten
â¢ c people into consenting to the establishment
of a military tyranny as was done by Louis Napoleon
fifty years .
the showing made the outlook for France, for
lent Loubet and for the Waldeck-Rousseau
Ministry is bright. The Government has confidence
in itself, and that in tuni *ill obtain for it the confi
dence of the public. When Paris is so well ordered
that Ministers do not become excited over the appear
ance of red flaf .t public demonstrations it is
evident things are going well and there is no danger
I
It will be remembered that when the new Cabinet
took office there were predictions it would not last
long. It was said to be a compromise Ministry, rep
resenting no particular party, and called to of:ice only
to carry the country over the crisis in the retrial of
fa*. The -Ministry, however, has had the good
fortune to include among its members one of tho^e
rare men who seem ordained by fate to come forth
at critical emergencies and prove themselves to be
the right men in the right place at the ri^ht time.
Premier Waldeck-Rousseau may not be strong " or
wi-r, but in the War Department there is a statesman
â¢ c first order. General Gallifet has been do
ing a remarkable work in clearing the general
staff and incidentally the army of the gang who made
such a scandal as that of Dreyfus possible. He has
Aon goldf m all sons of people, and he
is known to be resolute and courageous. With such
a man in command of the army there need be no
â¢of red flags nor of military conspiracies. His
influence has been felt throughout the country, and,
thanks to it. it is quite probable the Waldeck-
Rousseau Ministry will hold office long enough to
see the exposition of next year brought to a close
and the republic entering safely upon new fields of
endeavor.
OUT of the loss of trade resulting from the ex
re of the so-calied "embalmed beef fur
nished to the American army during the Cuban
campaign it was believed the beef trust would learn
a lesson profitable to itself and would never fill a
rnment contract with such stuff again. It ap
howevcr. the lesson uas given in vain, for by
rts from South Africa it iÂ« learned that some of
the beef supplied to the British troops on the trans
ports was of the same kind as that which caused the
scandal here. In fact, the London Chronicle asserts
some authorities in that city nave "a suspicion that
some of the meat supplied to the Government for use
on British transports was meat which had been re
jected by the United States during hostilities in
t, where it was picturesquely known as embalmed
beef, and relabeled with the mark of the, current
year."
It would be a curious commentary on trust methods
of doing businr<s should thÂ»sc suspicions prove to be
well founded We should then have an illustration of
what can be accomplished in the way of selling goods
to advantage under the most adverse circumstances.
The rotten beef supplied to our army was subjected
to a prolonged investigation. A large body of testi
mony was taken and every salient feature of it
elaborated by discussion in Congress, by officials o?
the War Department and by the press. If after all
that the astute salesmen of the betf packers' combine
I take that same old rotten truck, relabel it and
sell it to the British Admiralty Office they deserve
credit for their persistency a<= well as punishment for
the iniquity to which it was devoted.
There is one feature of the case which should not
be overlooked. It has been repeatedly said by the
supporters of the trust system of doing business that
by eliminating competition it would eliminate the
temptation to dishonesty. The trust, having a vir
tual monopoly of some great staple article, could
afford to keep it up to a high standard of purity and
excellence. The managers of the trust would be un
der no necessity to resort to adulterations or other
tricks in order to compete with unscrupulous rivals.
All Mich arguments vanish into nothingness before
the light which has been thrown upon the methods
of the bed trust. Caught in the act of supplying the
American army with vile beef and now suspected of
selling to the Rritish Admiralty the very stuff that
was rejected here, it is evident a trust can be as
tricky .is any rascal on record, and that the frauds
perpetrated in the way of impure foods are not due
altogether to the competitive system- of doing busi
ness.

EXPANSION"
VERSUS
IRRIGATION.
John D. Spreckcl? of San Francisco, a
member of the Republican National
Committee, passed through Chic;i.
v en route tv Washington to
a meeting of the committee. He was in-
terviewed in the Windy City and announced himself very em
phatically as an anti-ex; I As I came through the
t prairies of the West.'" he said, "on this trip I could not
help but think of the great good that might have been done
inourown country with the money which we are now spending
to maintain the army in the Philippines. If that money had
been put in irrigation in the Western countries I believe the
United States would have reaped greater benefits from it
than it ever will by the retention of the Philippines."
This is a practical suggestion that will strike the average
reader as ; I sense. The money that ha,
been expended in the Philippines would have constructed
reservoirs ample for the needs of the arid region for a gen
eration, perhaps two generations to come. These re-er
would have brought millions of acres under cultivation, and
made homes for more people than there are in the whole
Philippine archipelago. Their productive ci >uld
have added billions of dollars to the nation's industries and
increased its domestic trade in like proportion. Compare I

CIVIL SERVICE APPOINTMENTS
UNDER THE NEW CHARTER
To the Editor of The Call: Within the
past ten days several persons who belong
to what Is familiarly referred to In the
papers as "th-; push" have consulted me
with reference to the civil service pro
visions of the new charter. What they
want to know is whether or not, after
making a successful "fight" for a position
under the new government on a spoils
basis, they will be compelled to take up
the study of arithmetic, geography, spell-
In^ and reading In order to qualify them
selves to hold on. I am a strict civil ser
vice reformer myself, entertaining no
sympathy ; whatever for the spoilsmen,
and I have uniformly answered these in
quiries ex parte, in each case advising the
member of "the push" who consulted m*
that the better and safer way was to
observe the law and buckle down to study.
But an examination of the civil *pr\~\c*:
provisions of thi> r | con
vinced me that, whatever may bÂ«vome of
the question of permanent tenure here-

the claspif

As a Republican who is stanch enough to be a member
of the National Committee, Mr. Spreckels by this Â«:
practical suggestion has struck a body blow at the imp'
i-tic policy of the party. Even better than this, his re:
indicates that practical and enterprising buÂ«ineÂ»s men, -
as he is, are thinking upon this irrigation problem, and be

seems to Indicate that It was the Inten

be constituted on January S:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 23. 1899.
COCHRANE MAKES
VIGOROUS DENIAL
Attorney Furious Over
Bribery Charges.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL. Nov. 22.-Attorney
James W. Cochrane declares that he d:d
, not offer a bribe of $500 to Dr. Wlnn to
change the testimony he was expected to
offer ln the Griffin cane. Dr. Wlon as
that he solicited no bribe and did
not tell anybody at all that Cochrane had
â  vored to corrupt him. Cochrane Is
emphatic ta his statement that Winn d.d
come into the offices of Jones & O'Don
aeU in the Parrott building a week ago
â¢ y and did ask for $100 to give
testlm : | :..-. ruble to the defense. Winn
siiys he was not there.
Attorney J. W. Keycs, Patrick Mulva
' ney and another person say that Winn
accused Cochrane of attempted bribery in
a saloon In San Francisco. Winn admits
he woe in the saloon and says he was
sober; the others say be was partially
intoxicated. Attorney Cochrane made a
positive declaration that he would stand
up In court to-day and there air his
grievances. He did not and his friends
i now assert that he was entirely ..oo mod
| tst to seek such publicity.
This mass of statements, contradictory
and otherwise, represents the status of
the corruption charges In the famous
Griffin will case. As all connect
ed with the affair except the plaintiff and
I his lawyer are falling over one another
I to register denials It is unlikely that the
I Grand Jury will have a chance to enjoy
j itself by holding an investigation.
! "I didn't solicit a bribe, was never of
| fered one and didn't ask for one. That
;is all I have to say." This was Dr.
j ion's statement.
"If Winn said I offered nlm $600 he 13
lan Infamous liar. He came to Mr. O'Don
; nells office in the Parrott building awÂ«;ek
j ago last Monday evening and in the pres-
J ence of Attorney Jones and myself asked
| for tIOO. He was refused and went away.
: The man is a morphine fiend and is drunk
I half the time. Nothing ho says can be
; trusted." This Is Attorney Cochrane's
; version.
The defense continued the furnishing of
: evidence showing Mrs. Griffin to be sane
â  to-day and contrary to expectations v 111
â¢ not finish until to-morrow. Those who
: swore they believed Mrs. Griffin sane
from the business relations they had with
her were: Chester Patton. ex-Judge
, Fisher, Edward Bean, S. Browning, Mrs.
i Mary Rer.ehan. Mrs. Annie McEwen and
, Andrew Markham. a director of the Don
; ahue line. While cross-examination did
i not affect the evidence given It was not
: of a strong character.
Attorneys Jones & O'Donnell, who
opened the Griffln will, testified to Its
! validity, as did also Arthur T. Barbour,
a witness to the testament. Court was
: then adjourned until to-morrow morn
i Ing.
Still More Counterfeiting.

other band of counterfeiters and secured a larpe

QUINCY'S RECEPTION TO
LIEUTENANT CALDWELL
Citizens of the Gallant Young Naval Officer's
Town Will Welcome Him Home.
QUINCY, 111., Nov. 22 â Qulncy will make to-morrow a holiday over tho re
turn of the grallant naval officer. Lieutenant Harry H. Caldwell. U. S. N.,
secretary to Admiral Dewey, and according to "the admirals own words
his right-hand man at Manila and ln the trying times which followed the
memorable hattle.
v - ns th* writer ot Dewey's famous dispatches following the sinking of
the Spanish tleet that this young officer first came Into notice, and his capa
bility la thiF frying position has kept him at the front. When Admiral Dewey
returned ti Washington last month he Introduced Lieutenant Caldwell to Presl
ua "the talented young officer who composed all my dispatches
But It 18 nut only as a master of clrar English and diplomacy that
distinguished. He wield* the sword as well as the per., and when at
I Manila the QU >ta "f line officers wa? short he rolunteered to dlrt-ct
one of the Olympia ~ , y batteries and did It In a manner that won the
approval of nil captain and obtained for him especial mention ln reports for
gallantry In action. For this he was promoted ten numbers In the list of en
signs und lat>--r was apain promoted to lleuter.unt. Junior grade. Since his return
to this country he has been again promoted and now holds the rank of lieu
tenant of the senior grade.
If A.imlral Dewey had not vetoÂ«Â»d the expedition at the moment It was setting
out Lieutenant Caldwell would have vied with Hobson in audacity and daring.
After the battle In which the Spanish fleet was sunk the Americans discovered
that â erera] small Spanish gunboats had taken refuge ln the Paslg River, where
the draft cf the American men-of-war would not allow them to follow. To
allow these detractive little fighters to remain where they were was a constant
menace to the fleet and there was much concern as to how they should be cap
tur. .1 or destroyed. Then It waa that Lieutenant Caldwell laid a plan before the
admiral. It was to take an armed boat's crew at nifht into the river and tor
pedo the gunboats. The risk attached was fearful, and the originator of the
plan knew that the chances were 100 to 1 that not a man would get back alive.
If they were not blown up along with the boats they destroyed they would be
Intercepted by the soldiers and cut to pieces. But the young officer argued that
the gunboat* must be dtstroyed for the safety of the whole fleet, and that It
would be better to lose a handful of men than all. Finally and reluctantly the
a.imirn! pave hi? consent and Caldwell got his volunteer crew together and was
on the point of setting off when his commander's heart failed him and he ordered
him back.
The pluck and determination that has brought reward to him in his chosen
profession has always characterized Caldwell. He belonged to that large class
of American boys who have their own way to make ln the world. He was not
blessed with riches, and being a sturdy boy he enrly started to carry pnp<*r= r<>r
an afterr.oon dally. When he reached the age of 14 an<! â¢ man year In the
hljrh school a vacancy for his Congressional district occurred at Annapolis. On
the morning that the competitive examination was held he flrst heard about it
and determined to try It. He presented himself before the examiners an .
given the list of queetlons. He worked at them until the hour when It was
necessary to be at the newspaper office to carry his route. Gathering up his
papers unfinished he handed them to the board and told the members that he
would hay.- to quit ln order to attend to his duties. He was told that It was
against the rulvs governing examinations to allow a candidate to leave the room
Rr.d again tuke up the task. Then he said: "I shall have to give this up. I
must carry my route." And he did.
This devotion to duty surprised and pleased the board and It determined to
Five this sturdy lad a chance. That evening he was sent fur and allowed to fin
ish tr 'n the Congressman's office. He w.. n the appointment. In the
fall of l* y 7 he reported at Annapolis and began his naval education.
;tenant Caldwell will return to his old home ln Qulney to-morrow, and ln
the evening â  banquet will be given him at the Hotel Ne*wcomb. Two hundred

An Excellent Combination.
1 The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
BTBDr of Figs, manufactured by the
Califokma Fio BimiP Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative uml presenting 1
them in the form most refreshing to the
tast* and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, hcadnches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna &nd
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fie Syrup

SACRAMENTANS COMPLAIN
OF POOR TRAIN SERVICE
Two O'Clock Train Discontinued and
Travelers Forced to Patronize
the West-Bound Flier.
BACRAMKNTO, Nov. 22.â Much com
plaint is expressed lure relative to the
Southern I'm. lrtc train service. Some
weeks ago. without any apparent good
reason, the 2 o'clock local afternoon train
for San Francisco was withdrawn, al
though It bad always been liberally pa
tronized by business men and thÂ« public
generally, who desired to arrive at the
metropolis to attend the theaters or nil
business engagements. As a concession
to the public, however, and to satisfy the
complaints, the Southern Pacific made the
announcement that SaeramÂ«<ntuns who
wanted to reach San Kraml.-co in |
sonable hour might take the new west
bound flyer, which is supposed to come ln
at 2:10 o'clock and leave five minutes
later, but the train Is often late in arriv
ing here and the wait wl.*n it does come
Is scarcely long enough to enable a man
to catch his breath. Besides be must pay
the Pullman fee for a seat, and if there
are no spare seat! he cannot gn at all.
The westbound overland, whl^h is -ui;>
pof=ed to leave three hours later, I
layed half tho time, often being thl
four hours late. Besides this, the local
for Stockton is frequently two and three
hours beoind sch.-duled time ln leaving
Sacramento and the result Is naturally a
great Inconvenience to tho<.-> who have
business or other engagements at Stock

VI. THE TAMING OF THE SHREW
That Shakespeare did not write certain
portions of several of the plays attributed
to him Is now a well-established fact:
and "The Taming of the Shrew" Is one of
these pieces of mixed authorship, and one
that presents peculiar difficulties to the
critic who attempts to settle the date of
Its composition and the precise share that
our dramatist had In it.
The History of the Play.
"The Taming of the Shrew" was first
printed, so far as we know, in the fe
1623. A quarto edition appeared In IS3I.
with the following title page, which I
transcribe from one of the copies ln the
Boston Public Library:
"A WlttlÂ« and Pleasant Corned!* Called The
Taming of the Shrew.' As It was acted by his
Maiestles Servant* at the Blacke. Friers and
tho Globe. Written by Will. Shakes^are.
London. Printed by W. S. for John Smeth
wicke. and are to be sold at his Shop in Saint
Dunstonea Churchyard, voder the I 'Mil. lÂ«l."
A minute comparison of th'.s q
with the folio proves that the former was
printed from the latter. Mr. J I" Cottier
(in his second edition of Shi
works) maintained that the quart
printed before 1623â perhaps as early as
r l."!*âan d that a remnant of the
ei'.itlon was brought out by â methwtcke
in 1631, with a new title page, but it hftl

been shown that the title page forms part
of the first sh<vÂ»t of the book an-1 that
â ;>â¢ r on which It Is prlnt.-.l i
tl<\il with that uned fur the rest of the
play.
In the folio thÂ© play was evidently
printed- from a manuscript copy which
had been used by the actors In learning
their parts. The name "Slncklo" appears
In the first scene of the Introduction as
the prefix to a speech of one of the play
ers: "[ think 'twas BotO that your honor
means." Sinoklo, Slnklo or Slnkler, as the
name is variously spelled, was an actor
of the time, who played in other of Shake
speare's dramas. AÂ»rain. In 'The Shrew,"
111, 1, the servant who enters Is called "a
messenger" in the folio, and the prefix In
his speech Is "Nlcke," which probably
stands for Nicholas Tooley. one of the
actors In Shakespeare's company, a list of
which Is given in the introductory pages
of the folio.
The play Is not mentioned in Francis

"The Taming of the Shrew."
In 1594 a play was published anony
mously under the title of "A Pleasant
Conceited Historic Called the Taming of
a Shrew," which has been "sundry times
acted by the Right Honorable the Eorle
of Pembrook his servants." It was "print
ed at London by Peter Short" and "Â«jtd
by Cuthbert Burble, at his shop at the
Koyale Exchange." A second edition was
Issued in 15% and a third In NOT.
Of the first (lfM) edition only one copy
is known to be In existence. It Is In the
library of the Duke of Devonshire, who
paid Â£97 for It In 1834. Of the lusis edition
also but one copy is extant. In the library
of Lord Francis EÂ«erton. Of the third
edition thro? copies survive, one of which
belongs to the Duke of Devonshire. The
llrst Edition was reprinted by Stevens In
1776, by the Shakespeare Society In l<4l
and again in "Shakespeare's Library"
(second edition, 1875); also In IlalllwcU's
great folio edition of Shakespeare (IjOJ-oo)
and the "Bankelde" edition ilSÂ«).
Who wrote this piny? A few critics
hare thought that Shakespeare was the
authorâ or one of the authors, for II has
come marks of a mixed compositionâ hut
this seems to me very Improbable. One
writer says that the resemblance between
portions of It and the later piny prove
that the two must have come from the
same hand; but they prove simply that
Shakespeare did not trouble himself to
rewrite those parts of the original', but
left them pretty much as he found them.
The theory that Shak*>spcare wrote the
old play has been ably defended by A. 11.
Frey In the introduction to the "Har.k
slde edition of the play. He lays some
stress on the fact that Sly Is the name of
the tinker in the earlier Induct as In
the later: and both Christopher Sly and
Stephen Sly are proved by ancient rec
ords to have been Stratford names .11 the
poet's day. But Stephen Sly is found only
In Shakespeare's play (md. 2. 91). and the
sole evidence that the earlier tinker was
called Christopher is his referring to him
self as "Don trlsto Vary" once when he
is under the delusion thai he Is a lord
Even If he was a Christopher Sly it may
be a mere coincidence, as Sly was not
an uncommon name elsewhere In Eng
land. The other Warwickshire allusions
âto Wlneot, Barton-on-the-Heath, etc â
are not found in the old play.
if Shakespeare wrote the old play it is
strange that in revising It he changed the
names of all the characters except Kate
(which he Italianized into Katherina) and
Sly. The latter he very likely retained be
cause it was a Stratford name. The eccno
of the old play Is in Athens, but in the
later one It is changed to Padua. Shake
speare was In the habit. of making theÂ«Â«e
changes In names and localities when
dealing with the work of other men (as
for Instance. Lodge's novel of "Rosa
lynde" In "As You Like It") except In his
torical or quasi-historical plays but
r^-uint no evidence thai he ever did it in
revising or rrcon.-tructlng work of nU
r!# ;-^Â° r^ft. 80 fnr a * 'am aware, ha*
referred to this whnU-Â»alr change of
names In "The Shrew" ns rearing upon
the question of authorship. l,ut It sterna
to me to have some w.Mp'.itâ at least In
connection with other arguments on thÂ«
same side. EÂ»en If Hhak. Â«p.>are hi.t
wished to change th<- seme of the earlier
Tiny, v was not necessary to change the
names of the character.-*. Firando <thÂ«
original of lvtruchlo) was already Ital
ian, and Aurelius Alphonsun. etc., could
have been made Italian by changing th.Â»
endingâ us to o. If all the old names ha 1
been retained It would rot have been a
worse medley than he has given us In
"A Midsummer Night's Prvam." "Twelfth
Night" and certain other plays.
To my thinking the Inferior versifica
tion of the old play proves conclusively
that It was not written by Shakcspear*.
He was a born mÂ»tr!*t. His verÂ»e in ih<>
earliest work that can be ascribed to him
is always faultless In structure and gen
erally smooth and musical. The earliest
date that has been conjecturally assigned
to the old play .- I believe. VX). or almost
exactly the m* as that of "Love's
Labor's Lost." which Grant White make*
"not later than IZSS." and the majority of
other critics IWI or ISD2. at latest.

his play is a
earlier one. On tho
whole. It Is more
probable that ho
worked, not upon
the original "Taming
of a Shrew." but up
on i revised and
enlarged version of
that comedy mado
by some unknown
writer and no longer
extant. This Is tho
theory of Furnlvall.
Dowden and others.
As Furnlvall puts It.
"An adapter, who
used at least ton bits
of Marlowe In it.
first recast the old
play, and then
Shakespeare put Into
the recast the scenes
In which Katherina.
Petruchlo and Clru
mlo appear." Dow
den remarks: "In
The Taming of tho
Shrew* we may dis
tinguish three parts:
11) The humorous In
duction, in which
Sly. the drunken
tinker, is the chiÂ»f
person: (2) a comply
Â«>f character, th*
Shrew and her tamer
Pcfruchio being the
hero and heroine; i ;>
a comedy of lntriguo
âthe story of Blunru
and her rival lovers.
Now the old play of
*A Shrew" contains.
In a rude form, tho
scenes of the induc
tion, and the chief
scenes In which po.
truchlo and Ka:h-
â . . â original writer Fer
ando and Kate) nppear: but nothing In
this old nlay corresponds with tho In
trigue of Blanca's disguised lovers. It
.!' how , eve r. In the scenes connected with
these Intrigues that Shakespeare's hand
Is least apparent."
Grant "White also recognizes traces of
three writers In th*> play. The author of
the old play Is to bo credited with "the
* tr J? C }u Te of the plot and tne incidents
and the dialogue of most of the minor
Frenes : the second writer with "the
greater part of the love business between
IManca and her two suitors." whllo "to
bhakeÂ«peare belong the strong, clear
characterization, the delicious humor and
the rich verbal coloring of the recast In
duction and all the scenes In which Kath
erina and PÂ»-truchlo and Grumlo apptar
together with the general effect produced
by scattering lines and words and phrases
here and there and removlne others else
where throughout the play.
This last point seems to me an Impor
tant rtâ¢: and Jt explains. I think. thÂ«
difficulty that some of the critics have
had In deciding Just how much Shake
speare had to do with certain parts of
the play. H. rewrote considerable por
tions of It and retouched the rest *^
The Sources of the Plot.
The story of the induction Is very an
cient, at least as old as the tale of "The
SWt! AwakrnM" In the "Arabian
Nights. The author of the old play prob
ably took It from an anecdote In a col.
lection of short comic stories "sett forth
by Halster Richard Edwards. malsNr of
her Majesties revels in 157i>." Other old
versions, besides that In the "Arabian
M sh J s> ,, are n str ' r >' of th * Kmperor
Charles V, recorded by Howard Statin
ton In his edition of Shakespeare- and a
similar story of Philip the Oood of Bur
gundy, narrated by Burton In his "Anat
omy of Melancholy." IQL Burton also
quotes an anecdote of a Tartar prince
takon from Marco Polo, which is of the
same tenor.
The story of Blanca and her lovers is
founded upon Gascolgne's "Supposes " ,i
translation of Arloato's "I Suppositl "
which was first acted In ISCB. The Italian
play was first published In 1324 and re
printed eight times bt-furr 13DS. The Latin
lesson was perhaps suggested by a simi
lar scene In tho play of 'Three Lords ami
Ladies of London." 1.'.n0.
The Katherina and Petruchlo part of th*
plot has not l*-en traced beyond the old
play of \yj\: but somewhat similar stories
of wife-taming had appeared earlier In
English. Spanish and Italian. A humor
ous tale In verse, entitled "A Merry lesto
of a Shrewd and Curste Wyfe. Lapped In
â Morrellns Skin, for Her Good BÂ«hauyor "
was printed in London without date but
probably as early as ISCOL It became very
popular. I-anfham In his famous "Let
ter from Ker.llworth" (IJ7S) refers to It
as one of the stories which Captain Cox
had "at hi.- lingers' ends."

CHICAGO. Nov. 22.â Wheat failed to hold Its
own to-day. The openincâ December at 67 l Â«s>
67Sc and May at 71 l 4'ft71 ! >ieâ was at a gain
of \kC over yesterday's close. Cables were
higher and to this the early strength was
mainly attributable. Business waa mostly in
the hands of professionals and changing of
December and May contracts, which made up
a large proportion of the trade, whs within a
range of 'â¢->'. an was all other business In
wheat. Around the opening figures the market
fluctuated narrowly for half the session. Then
It weakened and there was considerable liqui
dation of both December and May. a report
that I > 1 1 1 vi 1 had boats loaded with 25Q.non
bushels for this port was a factor In the
weakness. Decemlwr sold down to i".o'<,c and
May to 71Jj71MiC. December closed Viff*Â»e
lower at C6 7 tifG<>7c, and May Â»ie under yester
day's final figures at 71M,c.
Coin wna steady. Rains continued In the
crowing l>elt and cables were factors which
encouraged purchasers to take in all offerings
p.) figures above yesterday's closing prices.
Clearances were enormousâ l,ooo.ooo bushels and
country offerings small. December closed HW
Uc higher at 32*ifj32%c. May closed unchanged
at 34'*c.
Oats held their own. though the trade was
dull. The strength of corn and the curtailing
of the movement by wet weather were in
fluences. December closed a shade lower at
2.?S,(irj3%c. May closed %c under yesterday at
24\e.
Provisions were barely steady, the only In
cident being the retaking of n line of pork,
presumably to replace rome sold some weeks
ago at higher prices. The close was at a loss
of 2Hc on nil I 1 -.nary products.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON', Nov. 12.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
"The wool market continues active. Prices
are steadily advancing to â¢ higher level and as
quotations ripe the more intense mmi to be
the eagerness of many to buy. A tremendous
business hnÂ» been transacted, the sales of th*
week aggregating over 13.0i'Â«l.OOO pounds, which
has been pretty well distributed among consum
ers, speculators and members of the trade,
many of whom are compelled to buy In the
open market In order to attend to the needs of
their customers. The markets abroad continue j
to display a hardening tendency and late ad- |
vices state that in Melbourne some of the very
best stock has been disposed of at prices which
mean Si per pound, clean, landed in Boston.
The active demand for woo has depleted stock*
bo that it Is estimated that we will report a
\ Fhortage of from 75.0 M.000 to 100,000,000 pounds \
by next May. in which case It Is quite probable
that importations will result. During the past
week carpet wools have apparently begun to
share In the activity noted in other grades. Car
pets have opened at advanced prices and large
purchases have been made.
The sales of the week In Boston amounted to
15.973.0C0 pounds domestic and 770.000 pounds for
eign. making a total of 13,743,000, against a to
tal of 16,317,776 for the previous week and a
total of 1.879.000 for the corresponding week last
year.. Rale? since January 1. ISM, amount to
314. 067.576 pounds, against 118,610,010 pounds last
year at this time.

j this cily for the benellt of returning sol

In order to continue Its good work an
appeal !.-Â« made to the public for further
! contributions. Soldiers who have landed
i in this city, discharged from service. *\cs

j like condition will come to this city week
aftÂ« r week, and it is to accord them the
i rame helpful hand that the Rod Cross
! Society now appeals to the public of San
I Francisco.
The delay in the present appeal was on ;
nccoum of* an expectation on the part of
the society that such portion of the fund
given to the citizens' executive committee
as was not usetl in entertainment would
all be devoted to soldiers' relief work. If

TREASURE FOUND ON
SUNKEN SPANISH SHIPS
The Government Was Badly Advised
Regarding the Disposal of the
Captured Vessels.
SANTIAGO. Cuba. Nov. 22.-Cuban
wreckers who have been employed during
the last six month* in stripping Spanish
war vessels destroyed by Americans in
battle off Santiago, are reported to have
found $190,000 in Spanish gold in the
crulwr Almlrante Oquendo.
This gold was found in the Oquendo's
safe, which fell to the bottom of the chip
â¢men tho vessel was burned. The safe
was opened by divers yesterday. They
had constructed a shaft, being unable to
raise the safe. The finding of the money
is likely to cause a controversy between
the wreckers and the agent of a commer
cial line which has furnished all the div
ing apparatus and paid the men SI cents
a pound for brass and copper recovered
The wreckers insert that money was not
covered In the arrangement made with
them.
More than $100,000 worth of brass and
copper has been taken from the Alml
rante Oquondo, Vlscaya. Cristobal Colon
and Furor. The wrecking of the last two
Is now in progress. The Furor la Ing In
thirty feet of water, and shows little
damage, and in the opinion of experienced
wreckers the United States has been badly
advised regarding the reclaiming of ves
sels.
The large sums of Spanish gold and sil
ver found on the vessels Is due to the
expectation of Admiral Cervera that he
would escape with some of his ships The
money had been received to pay off the
Spanish troops. Prominent Spaniards say
the presence of so much gold on the war
ships was due to the l.rlief of the Span
irh commanders that the city of Santiago
would Â»>c taken, but that some of the
ships might escape with the money.

WILL ENTER THIS CITY
TO RIVAL WELLS-FARGO
Great Northern Express Company-
Making Arrangements to Compete
for the Business of This City.
Notwithstanding the fact that the orti
clals of Wells, Fargo .v Co. seem to think
the idea of a rival in this city Is prepos
terous, yet a rival they are to have and
â¢ â¢ne that will make them move to keep
their end of the business up to anything
like Its present magnitude.
Staying at the Palace on his way to th.-
East is W. J. Footner, vice president and
general manager of the Great Northern
Kxpresa Company. Mr. Footner comes to
this city from Seattle and Portland,
where he has been looking Into the con
cerns of the great corporation of which
he is the practical head, and his presence
here Is to perfect arrangements with the
J'aelllc Coast Steamship Company which
will allow hjm to enter into competition
with Wells. Fargo &, Co. In this city.
The latter company has contracts with
the Southern Pacific Company, the Santa
Fe and the San Francisco and San Joa
quin Valley railroads which assure It a
positive monopoly of all the trans
continental business coming into this city
Â»>y rail. The Great Northern Express
Company has terminals at Portland and
the Puget Soun.l ports, and, while It can
not touch Wells-Fargo on the railroad
. i.d of it as far as San Francisco is con
corned, it can. through Its recent contract
with the Patllle Coast Steamship Com
pany, reach this city by water and at .i
cost that will allow it to cut way under
Its rival In the matter of charges. The
difference in time Is only slight because of
the comparatively short distance that the
goods will have to be sent by water, while
the (Terence in price will be a matter of
considerable moment, particularly when
the new company absorbs the war tax
which at present Wells-Fargo compels its
shippers to bear themselves.
This new competition by the Great
Northern Express Company not only
means thai it will affect the present busi
ness done by Wells-Fargo; it also means
that it will have considerable effect on the
Southern Pacific by diverting much of the
trade from that road and sending over
the more northern lines the immense
business that the cheaper rates will be
sure to attract.

Sutter Creek, ana at the present time he
holds the position of Justice of the Peare
According to the story which Darling
tells, hi* wife permitted Dr. c.ues to per
form n criminal operation upon her, al
though acainst the husband's strong pro
test. Soon after her visit to the village
doctor Mrs. Darling died and she was
hurled without any public Investigation j
Irto the manner of her demise. Sheriff
Gregory was not satisfied and an order
for the exhumation of the body was or- '
dered and warrants for the arrest of Dr. I
Giles and Darling Issued.
Darling told a startling story In this
city. He informed the constable who ar
rested him that after his wife's visit to
the doctor she had to be brought home In
a wagon, and her death soon ensued: that
after her death Dr. Giles offered him $150
and agree.i to nay all his wife's funeral
expenses provided he would keep quiet
about the circumstances of her death
Darling protests that he can clear himself
of the suspicion implied In his arrest upon '
an order fr< m the Amador Sheriff An '
inquest begun at Sutter Creek to-day re- i
suited in no conclusion tn-nlght. Dr Giles
accompanied Sheriff Gregory to Jackson
while IÂ»nrlint,' remained | n Sutter Creek
although not In custody.

CHINESE EXEMPT
FROM PAUPER
PROHIBITION
Beggars and Cripples
May Come In.
Port Collector Jackson announced yes-,
terday that he was very well piâ Â«d with
the determination of the Trtiisury De
partment to ask Congress at the coming
session to amend the exclusion act and
the Immigration laws so that the Chinese
Bureau might be transferred to the Na
tional Immigration Commissioner.
He pointed out In section 10 of the act
Of March 3. UN, that the act by which
immigrants of all other nationalities are
bound does not apply to Chinese immi
grants. Section 1" says. "This act shall
not apply to Chinese persons." The act
provides among other things that aliens
seeking admission to the United Statrs
must certify that their passage had been
paid by themselves, andÂ»not by others.
In addition to complying with all the
other requirements of the law the Immi
grant must have at least $30 in cash, and
the Immigration Commissioner must be
convinced that the alien will bo able to
support himself for a reasonable length
of time upon his own resources. If the
alien be a cripple or a deformed person
he will not be admitted. Hut under the
provisions of section 10 of tho act if the
j.erson be a Chinese alien he may come
in. no matter how much of a cripple he
may be, so long as there remains t-nough
of him to speak Chinese and wag a queue.
The exclusion act provides that a Chi
nese laborer Intending to go back to China
with the purpose of returning to this
country must show to the Collector of
the Port that he owns 11000 worth of prop
erty In the United States, or has debts
to thnt amount owing to him here. Any
other alien returning to this country after
an absence, even on business, must run
the gauntlet of the Immigration tureau
Just as If he had never been here, and
should he have had the misfortune to
have lost an arm or a leg while Abroad
he may be denied admission. But the
Chinese coolie laborer bat no such re
strictions Imposed upon him. So long as
he has his return certificate In due form
he may come hither In rags, on two
wooden legs and without a cent. The
proviso that he must show before he
leaves for China that he owl at least
$1000 worth of property in this country, or
has that amount due him. Is not based
on good Judgment and â  knowledge of
the Chinese character. In the first place,
a Chinese coolie laborer, even if he tried,
could never get $1000 ahead of the world
on the. wages for which he work after
paying his company dues and support-
Ing himself during his idle seasons, not
to speak of such expensive luxuries as
fan tan, pie gow and the opium pipe. It
should be remembered that wb'te labor
ers usually have families, and that
father, mother and children have to work
In order to live half way decently. In
the second place, the poorest beggar of
a coolie can always produce two wit
nesses to swear that he owns $1000 worth
of interest in some Chinese store or fac
tory- Officials having much to do with
the Chinese know that this kind of per-
Jury is common.
As a further instance of the partiality
shown to Chinese immigrant- Collector
Jackson referred to a recent order which
has the effect of Insuring the return of
the departing coolie. Prior to July 31 ot
the present year the Chinese laborer de
siring to go to China was allowed to go
his way without hindrance or interfer
ence. If he did not take the steps neces
sary to Insure his being landed on his
return to this country that was his own
affair, and the Customs Department was
not troubled about the matter Hut the
recent ruling of the Treasury Department
revives an obsolete law, and since the
date named requires the coolie who In
tends to return to China to give the Col
lector thirty days' notice, in order that
the Collector may hnve an opportunity
of discovering whether the coolie has it
right to return to this country, thus Im
posing another burden upon thtÂ» Customs
Department, and watching over the In
terests of the coolie with a fatherly care
denied aliens of other nationalities.
"This whole Chinese business is a para
site upon the Customs Department," said
Collector Jackson yesterday. "It tukes
up the time of the Coll.. and his In.
spectors to the detriment of the service,
and It bears no relation whatever to the
duties of customs officers, for It has no
thing to Jo with the revenues of the Gov
ernment. I think the matter properly be
longs to the Immigration Department of
the Government, and the law should bo
changed so as to allow it to be taken
there/

FLOOD DESTROYS
INDIAN VILLAGE
Also Proved a Boon to
Many Farmers.
BpeclfU PtÂ»i>atch to The Call.
TACOMA. Nov. 22.â The Lummi Indian
village at the mouth of the Nooksack
River In Whatcom County has been near
ly swept away by a tremendous flood that
has poured down the river for three days.
Over half of the village is tfur.e an d the
destruction of church anu other build
ings is Inevitable. The Indlant> has
nearly all their property and are mov
ing the few effects they have left to
higher ground. Their winter's supply of
smoked salmon and Jerked beef is â¢
ly gone. Three years uto there w> re
ninety-five cabins and houses In the vil
lage, hut every year has dimmish. -d the
number. Last year six went Into 'he
rlvt-r at once, the occupants barely â¢
ing with their lives. This year will mike
the ancient village a thing of the past.
A number of houses were swept into t he-
Sound by the rushing water* and are
drifting out to sea.
The freshet will benefit the -Vooksack
Valley because It Is cutting a new chan
nel around an Immense log Jam over a
mile long that han totally blocked navi
gation in the river since ISSM and In
the cause of periodical overflows of the
finest farming land In Whan '.m '"ounty
and the ioss of thousands of dollars. The
IJelllnghiim Bay Uoom Company is uc
cused of being responsibl'- for the pn --
ence of the Jam, as that company some
years ago drove a double row .if piles
across the mouth of the river for !>.â¢â¢ m-
Ing purpiiÂ«>< and the piles gave the Jam
its first start
Ltticatlon has been started and carried
Into hiKher courti without relief to the
stiflVrii.K farmers. The County Attorney
is now .indi-r Instructions to Investigate
the question with a view to reopenlns 'he
litigation. Petitions and protests have

atlv<>s and Legislature, but no rÂ«-li-*f Has
secured until this flood came.

PRESS REVEALED
LAWYER'S PLANS
Protest From Molineux's
Counsel.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 22â The dramatic
feature in connection with the trial of
Roland B. Molineux on the charge of hav
ing caused the dt?ath by poison of Mrs.
Katherine B. Adams occurred immediate
ly after the noonday recess to-day, when
Barlow S. Weeks, counsel for the prison
er, emphatically protested against the
publication of a story to the effect that
the plea of the defense would be Insanity.
Recorder <;<.ft commented upon the com
plaint of the attorney for the defense at
considerable length, in conclusion saying
that Mr. Weeks might present to the
court at his convenience any information
concerning this matter that the defense
might see fit to produce. He asserted that
the court would consider the subject and
make a disposition of it In acordance with
the merits of the case. District Attorney
Osborne concurred with Mr. Weeks and
pleaded his hearty co-operation.
The newspapers which offended by out
lining the plea which it was claimed the
defense would make contained statements
tending to -how that a number of rela
tives of Roland B. Molineux had suffered
from various forms of insanity.
Not a Juror was selected to-day, though
more than fifty talesmen were interrogat
ed. Five seats in the Jury box still remain
unoccupied, though over 2T.0 candidates in
all have been examined. Of the talesmen
examined to-day twelve escaped because
they were opposed to circumstantial evi
dence, three did not believe in capital pun
ishment, four lacked general intelligence,
seven had formed opinions of the case,
and six were challenged without staled
reason.
HANDWRITING EXPERT
A MINUS QUANTITY
CAMPBELL SAYS ONE DOES NOT
EXIST ON THIS EARTH.
A new complication regarding the value
of testimony of and evidence produced by
handwriting experts developed yesterday
In the trial of the suit brought .>y John .
Fastene against F. Pardlnl, as adminis- ;
trator of the estate of Lulgi Pardinl, de
ceased, to recover $2500 on a- promissory ]
note alleged to have been executed June
1. â â¢- it Is alleged by the defense that
the note is a forgery and Theodore Kyt- !
ka. handwriting expert, was called to '
substantiate this claim. In order to save
time defendant's attorney. W. J. McOee.
called upon Joseph Campbell, plaintiff's
attorney. to admit that Mr. Kytka wan
a recognized expert and was in fact an
expert. Mr. Campbell said that he would
admit that Mr. Kytka Would give testi
mony regarding his studies of handwrlt
ing that would qualify him to give evi
dence in the case, but he woula not admit
that Mr. Kytks was an expert and â¢
would deny that there was a man living
capable of drawing a correct conclusion
of the manner In which a signature was
made unless he saw the operation. Th.- '
examination of the witness then proceed- j
cd. Mr. Kytka said that L. Pardini's J
signature on the note was a rank for
gery: that it had first been traced from '
a genuine Flgnature with a n^dle and ]
then Inked over, but the guide lines made
with th<> needle were not closely followed
and plainly show. Kvtk.i also said that !
the pen had been lifted from the paper !
during the process of inking no less than I
twenty-two times, while Pardlnl never !
lifted his pen while making his signature
more th m twelve times and seldom
ofter.er than eight.
Plaintiff counsel says that three wit
â¢â¢-â -â¢- will be produced who saw Par
din! sign the note and by this will es
tablish thi> contention that a handwrit
ing expert does not exist.

Â»hall be awarded to I'ettiboiie. but Colonel :
I'utler and Major GleÂ»ilug oppose his j
jilans In this ropect. A proposition to al- ;
low California dealers to supply s') per

j>ot>tt!oa of General Dlckinsou.

that he wa.M muslj.g to himself mat the'

DOM of SSeamar.s was nnt on straight, and *
t!iat the uniform Â«>f Siamans should bo ,

iomia in the Adjutant General's of nee.
No matter what else Glr-stir.g was think- i

Soamans abruptly Â«i. man-led that Giesting i
should nlkh Uie Petiibone contract the
major rhvo a snort of righteous wrath
btm exclaimed:
"What In hades have you got to do with i
It. anyway? You are not a member of the '
Uniform Jioard."
i^amans for repjy paJted himself on the
br'.-ist thrre times, GleFtlng watching in- i
tently to seÂ«* if his adversary was padded '
below the head. When the adjutant gen- '
cral taw that the major was fully ap- '
prised of his prerenc* he exclaimed:
"I am not a member of thÂ« Uniform
Board, sir. but I am adjutant general of
the State of California."
Major Giestlng did not waste many i

estimate of the adjutant general. He
closed the Interview by threatening to j
tell Governor Gage the true inwardness of i
the Dlck!n?on-StÂ«nans scheme to give
Pettibone the contract for blouws.
Subsequently Colonel Cutler and Major
Giestlng saw Governor Gaere but dirt not

blood polwoning had set in. and everything was done to check its course, but
without avail.
A* steward of tho gentlemen's prill at the Palace Btueky had in his seven

employers and employed and by the hundreds of guests the Palace houses.
Uy those of San Francisco who are fond of well living Stucky s death will
be considered sadly: his magnetism and many high qualities placed him on
a plane of warm friendship with those with whom his duties brought him
In almost doily contact, and by them his early taking oft will be mourned not
only as an accomplished caterer but as an Â«tteemed friend.
Mr. Stucky was a Mason and an Odd Fellow in high standing and his
funeral will bo held under the auspices of the first named order. He was

FRENNA SHOT
HIS VICTIM
FROM BEHIND
Fatal Bullets Entered
Turner's Back.
Joseph P. Frenna, who is on trial In
Judge Cook's department of the Supe
rior Court for the murder of James F.
Turner on the morning of August 29. ap
pears to entertain no apprehension as to
his fate. He sat by the side of his attor
neys In the courtroom yesterday and lis
tened to the testimony that may send
him to tho hangman, the look of .-.-::
satisfaction sever for a moment leaving
his face, not even when Dr. Zabala, the
autopsy physician at the Morgue, testi
fied that three of the four bullets that
took eftoct in Turner's body entered his
back, and that the fourth passes through
his right hand, perforating a bundle of
papers which were clutched therein.
As this evidence, when corroborated, as
the prosecution claims It will bo. effectu
ally disposes of Frenna's contention that
he shot Turner In self-defense, one would
suppose that the aJlesÂ»td assassin would
feel somewhat shaky upon hearing It
told In detail to the Jury by a responsible
witness.
In his opening statement to the Jury
District Attorney Murphy declared that
the killing of Turner was a cold-blooded
assassination, and that the prosecution
would prove that Frenna went to the
Crocker building on the morning of th.
tragedy for the express purpose and
with the deliberate Intention or commit
ting murder. He said that the prosecution
would prove also that Turner was un
armed at the time he met his death and
in no position to defend himself when
attacked; that when the occupants of
the offices In the building, alarmed by the
shots, arrived on the scene, Frenna was
standing over the body of his victim as
it lay on the floor of the corridor, with
Its back perforated with bullets from
his revolver, and finally that on several
occasions previous to the shooting
Frenna had been heard to threat. to
kill Turner. The taking of testimony was
then begun.
I>r. Zabala was the principaJ witness at
th'- morning sessli n. He testified t>> the
bullets found in Turn.-rs
sody, practically as described by the
District Attorney. Other wltn.isÂ«ea ex
;imtnÂ«-<l were George i>. Collins, who was
the murdered man's attorney, and whose
â¢:m latter had left but a f.-w min
before he was killed; John R.

who was one of the first to arrive at the

An Obdurate Father Outwitted and
Two Fond Hearts Joined To
gether in Wedlock's
Grolden Chains.
Tf the course of true lore does not, aa I
a general thing, run as smoothly as could
be wished by the loving hearts that beat
ln unison, the f;uilt can generally be
ascribed to <itii.-r an obdurate parent or
too offldous friends.
This may not hold true in all cases.
but It win be found to !>â¢â¢ the fad In the
recem trials and tribulations that have
the commencement of domestic life
for Mr. and Mrs. Al Woods, who are now
living at the Progress, a fashionable'
boarding-house on the corner of Butter
anil polk streets.
Mrs. Woods before her marriage on the
6th of this month wa* Miss Minna Vocke,
daughter of Qustava C. Vocke, â  wealthy
liquor merchant at 101 Clay str.-.-t, who
stands hiÂ«h in the German social em les
of tills city. Mr. Woods Was and still ih
a young clerk in the employ of the Ore
gon Railroad and Navigation Company
with nothing but his good looks, a heart
heavy with affection and a pocket li^ht
with shekels to r.'-ommend him.
These recommendations proved all suffi
cient in tho opinion of Miss Vocke, but her
father, while h.- bad nothing against the
young man personally and admired r>.>th
his good looks and the good character
| given him by his friends and employers,
s.riously Objected to him as a suitor (<r
i his daughter's hand both because he was
too young and be< ause be was not well
â¢ in. ugh supplied with the goods ..f this
world.
Woods presented his case to the old
man and urjfd his pretensi. .i..- with all
the eloquence of which be was a ,
But it was no kc The older Vocke prov< -I
obdurate and could be moved to conw nt
by neither argument nor persuasion.
There was only one thing to do, pnd
Woods, like a man of mettle, did it. He
Waited until the father had left on one
<>f his regular business trips to the In
terior of the State ;ind then persuaded the
daughter to tak-- â  ride over to San Ka
faei. where they were made man and wite.
They returned to the city, and taking
apartments at the Progress sal them- ,
Sown to await the r.-turn of the r,|,i
man. who they expected would make Â»he
â¢ if the situation and the young â¢
happy l'\ bestowing on them his bless-
Thus far til.- story told by Woodi
himself and his friends j:'
After tii>- return of Vocke iÂ»ere, however,
there are two yarns. Woods claim
the old man forgave them and all Is now
as merry as it should be after su. h a
pretty little romance. His friends, how
ever, will not have It that way. They In
sist that Vocke has disowned his daugh
ter and refuses to have anything to do
with either h> r or her husband.
Whatever the case, Woods has no rea
son to bemoan. He baa i wife
who is lovely as she Is accomplished, he
has the respect and the Confidence of his
friends and employers and a position
which, while it does not give him the in
come of a millionaire, pays him quite
enough to support the little homo on
Buchanan street which he and his wife
are to move into n.xt week.
The elder VockÂ«- Is now away on a busl
nesi trip and will not return until Mon
day next. When he gets back Woods sayi
he will have him to <linn.-r. Woo. ls 1 friends
say that when th.- old man returns he will
have Woods In the Morgue.

NO MORE GRAFTS
FOR CLERKS OF
POLICE COURTS
Charter Makes That
Business Bad.
This year's crop of candidates for Police
Court clerkships Is neither a* large nor
al varied as it h.is been in years past.
Those who are said to be in line for these
positions are for the most part either law
students or young men of good connec
ttoni who are willing to work for nothing
more thiin their salaries and the benefit
they will derive along their chosen lines.
The reason for it evidently lies in the fact
that th.- charter puts the position out of
the reach .if the professional grafter by
relieving the Police Court < - lerk of all re
iponslbulty and shouldering It upon the
County Clerk. Heretofore the court clerks
have had no other responsibility ihan
their own. They handle 1 all cash ball
d.-inanded by their respective courts; they
gave receipts for it. deposited It in the
treasury In their own names and gave It
up to whomever again presented the re
ceipt, and ln connection with their duties
along this line most of the scandals with
whl.-h they have been connected have
originated. I'nder the new order of things
the County Clerk Is clerk <>f the Police
Cnurt as well as of the Superior Court,
an.l all cash ball demanded will go into
his hands by order of the court. A<
County Clerk I>eane handles ball money
now, there Is not one chance In a hundred
of any acquisitive court clerk getting out
of office with any of it lining his pockets.
Instead of returning ball money upon
presentation of the receipt. Deane de
mands thai the claimant be represented
by ar. attorney, who shall make the de
mand. Th.-n upon a second order of court
the attorney la given an order upon the
Treasurer and permitted to collect for his
client.
The programme announced In The Call
yesterday morning suffered a slight
change at the hands of Sheriff Urkmann,
who announced yesterday that the ap
iiointment of Chris Newman as his chief
bookkeeper was by no means a certalntv.
Tor that place he Is considering not only
Newman, but Big Simon, the present
cashier In the i>nVe: Hlllie Hlattner and
Pal Walsh. Simon at the present time is
considered the favorite and Is being
strongly played by the push. K. K. Moran
also denies that no will accept the posi
tion of chief deputy offered him by As
i Dodge.
The statement that the Tloard of Health
will make a legal tight to retain Its office
Is emphatically denied by every member
of that body. They are content to accept
the provisions of the charter as passed
upon by the Supreme Court and claim
that the administration will find no
warmer support, rs of the new scheme of
government than they.
