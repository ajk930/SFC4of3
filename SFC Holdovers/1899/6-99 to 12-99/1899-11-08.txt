VOLUME LXXXVI-NO. 161.
MAYOR PHELAN WILL INAUGURATE SAN
FRANCISCO'S NEW LIFE UNDER THE CHARTER
Republicans and Democrats, by
the Discriminating Votes of
Citizens, Divide the Honor
of Administering Local Offi
cial Affairs for the Next
Two Years.
Asa R. Weils, Dr. Washington Dodge, Frank
lin K. Lane and William A. Deane Have
Again Been Chosen to Succeed Them
selves in Important Public Offices.
SAN FRAXCISCO'S first flection un
der the charter is an incident of po
liucal history. The Democratic
party, under the direction of Mayor
Jatned IX Phelan. has won a tri
umph. The Mayor h.-^s been chosen by the
people of the city to succeed himself, anil
with him his chief lieutenants Jiave been
elected.
The campaign which ended yesterday, in
the election, was in many ways a remark
â¢ nble one. It possessed nothing but local
significance. Both of the leading political
parties asked the suffrages of the people j
upon practically an identical issue. Hoth I
parties were supporters of the charter. I
Both asked for votes that the provisions
of the charter might be carried into full,
practical effect. Upon this single issue j
various aspirants went into the cam- j
paign and the people of San Francisco, by i
their votes, have decided that a majority j
of the Democratic nominees shall be the j
first administrators of the city's affairs i
under the charter.
At Â«n early hour this morning: thÂ© last I
rettiras of the balloting had not been re- â¢
celved by the Registrar of Voters, but the I
count shows clearly that Mayor Phelan ;
has been re-elected, by a majority of at i
least live thousand votes, to the position j
"which he now occupies. The unofficial |
count which gives him this majority j
may be increased fifteen hundred by the i
official count. Auditor Wells has been ;
elected to succeed himself. Assessor |
Dodge will receive perhaps the highest
vote of any aspirant for public office in
the local election, the unofficial count at
the Registrar's office showing that ho
was honored by two votes t>_> his op- |
ponent's one.
City Attorney Lane will also succeed
himself and will receive the compliment
of a tremendous majority. John Lack- j
mann, proving perhaps the prediction of *
those that thought he was a friend of i
Jlayor Phelan, will defeat Jeremiah Deasy
handsomely. Major Dennis Geary
has demonstrated that police duty in â 
Manila is not a passport to the County
Clerk's office, as he has been defeated by |
W. A Deane by a very large vote.
In the voting yesterday there was in i
every precinct of the city a discrimina- j
tion that perhaps was never equaled in a !
municipal election. As both parties rep- j
resented identical issues electors cast
their ballots for individual favorites. As
a result the patronage of political local
offices is almost evenly divided â  ween j
the Democrats and the Republicans, leav- j
ing out of consideration the tremendous ;
appointive power which the Mayor enjoys !
under the charter. In the major offices \
of the city government the Democrats i
have won the Mayor, the Assessor and j
the City Attorney. The Republicans will j
enjoy the patronage of the Auditor, the j
Sheriff and the County Clerk. The Demo
crats have also won a majority of the
members of the Board of Supervisors, the i
latest returns Indicating that at least j
thirteen of the Democratic rants have ,
been elected.
While the official returns, as they have
been received at an early hour this morn- j
Ing, are no' absolute Indication of the re
sult, it is probable that three of the lice '
Judges nominated by the Democrats have
been elected.
The result of the election, considering it
as a whole, ought to he accepted by the :
people of San Francisco as a matter of
congratulation. There was in the con
test which has just ended nothing of per
sonalities. The men nominated by both
of the great political parties were con
ceded to he men of repute,' men of honor
and men qualified for the positions they
sought. The campaign was fought hon
orably, arid the people of the city have
determined, with their voles, their choice
of the men who shall administer the af
fairs of the city government. In every
precinct of the city the voting proceeded
without Interruption and without any of
the violent scenes that have disgraced
former elections.
The registration had indicated that a
very heavy vote would be polled. Some
thing over 70,000 names bad been reg
istered, and the novelty at least of an ad
ministration under a new charter Indl- '
cated that nearly all of those who had
registered would vote. The result proved,
however, that nearly 20.000 people who had '
registered their names failed to vote. This i "
was accounted for partly by the fact that ! "
nearly WOO electors had changed their *
residences and had not properly certified "
the fact to the authorities.
Another remarkable incident of the "
election was the fact of early voting. -
While many of the prominent merchants -
of the town had made arrangements to i
permit their employes to vote during the H
afternoon, the record of the booths -|
showed that most voters cast their ballots j
before they went to work. .
It happened therefore that the voting H
of the afternoon was light. As already -J
Indicated, there was very little disturb- H
ance at any of the voting booths. In two \ 4
or three Instances election officers, ignor- -*
ant of their luties, committed mistakes <
that for the moment occasioned trouble,
and then an bcplanatlon prevented fur
ther disturbance. The police, with that
vigilance wblctl characterizes them under i
i
The San Francisco Call.
! the present administration, made six ar
rests for violation of the law which closes
j saloons on election day. The bluecoats
â  forgot, however, that every other saloon
jin town was pen. This fact fortunately
i did not result in any open breaches of the
j peace.
When the polls were closed the election
officers began without delay to count the

AN ELECTION BOW.
Richard Adams Tries to Help
Stranger and Is Stabbed.
Richard Adams, a laboring man living
at i"."' Clark street, dropped into an East
street retisÃerl* last evening for the pur
j! recuperating fr'>m the fatigue in
cident to tl m on a cup of coffee
and a couple of those delicate confections
known in the vernacular as "sinkers."
Adams entered the place just as a hot
political discussion was being waged be
tween T. Yestle, who resides at the City
Front House, and five strangers. Yestle
was getting the better of the argument
until one of the live, overcome by the
spirit of partisanship, hit him on the jaw
with his clenched fist. Yestle struck
back at his assailant and in a second a
first-class mix-up was in full swing. It
was Yestle against the nVe strangers.
Yestle was game, but the odds were too
many for him, and he was in a fair way
to become a fit subject for the Morgue.
Adams saw his predicament and, with the
true Anglo-Saxon desire of seeing fair
play, started to his assistance.
Yestle saw Adams coming, but not be
ing sure in what spirit hi advanced re
solved to takt no chances, and drawing
a clasp knife stabbed him in the chest
and wrist as soon as he approached with
in cutting distance.
Such ingratitude not only wounded
Adams, it angered him as well, Picking
up a brick, he struck Yestle with it, cut
ting a three-inch gash over his eye and
putting that useful member out of busi
ness for many days to come.
Before either one of the men could do
any further harm the police appeared on
the scene and escorted them over to the
Harbor Hospital for treatment.
Their wounds were found to be slight,
and after they had both been patched up
by Dr. Robinsin, Adams was allowed to
depart for his home, while Yestle was
taken to the Harbor Police Station and
booked for assault with a deadly weapon.
The original live who participated in
the preliminaries vanished as soon as the
event of the evening came on and were
not subsequently seen.
COAL PROSPECTS GOOD.
Experts Make an Examination of
Mines Near Antioch.
ANTTOCH, Nov. 7. â R. H. .Symington
and Thomas Poyzer, coal experts of San
Francisco, have made an examination of
the coal properties near Antio'ii owned
by the Colifornja Power Company, of
which c. L. Wilson is manager. They
were here in the interest of financial sup
porters of the mines, and their report is
very flattering- They spent three Jays at
the mines and examined the Empire, West
Hartley, Star and Central mines. They
report 11,400,000 ton? of coal available <>n
the company's lands at a depth entirely
practical to work.
They report also that It will be entirely
feasible to t;ike out 20,000 tons from mines
per month, or about 700 p<--r day. The
Central is the only mine that is now pro
ducing and from this mine alone 103 tons
per day s being taken. The mines are
again taking on their accustomed -tlvlty.
and miners are looking forward for a
repetition of the flush times. With so
much coal In sight they see no end of
work, and consequently are rejoicing.

REPUBLICANS EASILY
CARRY SACRAMENTO
Headed by George H. Clark for Mayor,
Almost the Entire Ticket Goes
Through.
GEORGE H. CLARK, Mayor-Elect of Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 7.â After an unusually exciting campaign, George Clark,
the Republican candidate, was to-day elected Mayor by a majority of 1*22
votes. To-nlghi the dtj is ablaze with bonfires in honor of the successful
candidate. Hundreds of young men, headed by James MeGrath, one of
Clark's chief supporters, arc parading the streets, accompanied by a band.
On almost every corner crowds of citizens are gathered, discussing the election
and predicting that Clark will make the best Mayor that this city has had In
many years.
The p<>llfÂ» opened at 6 o'clock this morning-, and scarcely had the clerks taken
their respective positions when the balloting commenced. The day was pleasant.
which in a measure accounts for the large vote. Supporters of Stephens were
plentiful, inn after making a determined tight up to noon they realized that they
were "up against it," so to Bpeak, and threw up the sponge. Stephens is down
over the result, as he had predicted that his friends would save him from
at least an overwhelming defeat.
Clark is correspondingly jubilant over his election. When seen to-night ho
"said: "I am indeed thankful to my friends for the handsome majority they gave
me over my opponent. I was confident of the result, but did not expect that I
would receive as many votes as I did. Now that the citizens of Sacramento
have shown their confidence in me I intend to prove to them that 1 am worthy
of their support. After I assume the duties of Mayor I intend to consult with
the business men of Che city, with a view of learning just what is needed to pro
mote the interests of the city. 1 shall endeavor to appoint men who are eminently
fitted for the positions in tlv* city government and will not allow petty grievances
to stand in the way of deserving citizens who aspire to positions under me. To
my friends I desire to return my heartfelt thanks tor carrying me to victory and
I also desire to express my thanks to The Call for its efforts In my behalf."
G. E. Hook, Republican candidate for Trustee In the Eighth' Ward, was de
feated for election by one vote. His opponent was M. R. Beard, an old-time
Democrat. Hook says he will contest the election of Beard. Kent (D. I won his
fight in the Second Ward, beating George Stack (R.) by 32 votes. Devlne (D.)
was re-elected member of the Hoard of Trustees over O'Neil and Thompson
(colored). Charles Robinson iK.) was re-elected City Collector by a big majority.

WILL DETERMINE WHO
SHALL PAY THE TAX
Supreme Court to at Once Take Up
the Case Against the Adams
Express Company.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 7. â Argument
will probably begin to-morrow in the
United States Supreme Court in the
case brought to fix the responsibility in
the matter of the payment of war revenue
taxes on packages sent by express. The
rase is entitled William Crawford vs. Wil
liam M. Huhbell, treasurer of the Adams
Express Company, and It was brought
upon agreement to decide whether the
tax should be paid by the shipper or the
terrier. Mr. Crawford is a member of
the Merchants 1 Association of New YorK,
which association Is supporting him in
the proceedings. Hon. Joseph H. Choate,
Emhassador to Great Britain, was one
of the original counsel in the case, but
since he went abroad he has been suc
ceeded by former Judge Allan L. McDer
mott. Other counsel for the merchants
are James B. Dill and Frederick R. Kel
logg. William D. Guthrie appears for the
Adams Company. The case was decided
pro forma in the courts below in favor of
the express company.
Dewey and His Fiancee.
NEW YORK:. Nov. 7.â Admiral Dewey

COMPROMISE AT
MARE ISLAND
Men Will Finish Work on
the Hartford.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Nov. 7.â The situation In the
differences between the authorities and
tlie shipwrights to-day was materially
changed, with a view to reaching a better
understanding on both sides. As has been
stated, at no time has been there been any
desire on the part of the workmen to take
advantage of the condition in which tue
Hartford was left, and their action to
day carries out what they have Maid. This
action Is in the nature of a compromise,
which was accepted on the part of the
shipwrights, that the work on the Hart
ford might be finished.
This elternoon Master Shipwright Tre
bell pppcared before the meeting of the
shipwrights at Young Men's Institute
Hall, at which place there was a full at
tendance, and to the men Mr. Trebell pre
sented a request on the part of Con
structor Hlbbs that the men return to
their work and finish the Hartford, that
the Government may not suffer in the
matter. He said that if the men would
comply with this he would vouch for
their being given an honorable discharge,
and that the blacklist cards already
turned in against them would be with
drawn.
The request was freely discussed, and
the liberal spirit of the men was shown
in a.n almost unanimous consent. Among
Those present to Bpeak in favor of this
action were State Senator Luchsinger,
who was therr- by invitation, and Presi
dent McConnell of the Shipwrights'
Union. Accordingly Mr. Trebell was au
thorized to say to Constructor tlil>!>s that
th ' shipwrights would return to work in
the morning. It is understood that the
compromise on the part of the men does
not in any way mean that they will relax
in their efforts to receive wages equal to
those paid by outside firms.

SPRING FAILS
TO PAY ALIMONY
Suit Filed by His Former
Wife.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 7.-Mrs. Emelie T.
Spring, who recently secured a divorce
from Henry M. N. Spring on the ground
of infidelity, to-day began a suit against
her ex-husband and Marcella S. and Fred
W. Moore, sinter and brother-in-law of
Spring, to have the transfer of a residence
and other property on Seventh and San
Antonio streets set aside and the same
levied upon to pay alimony.
When Mrs. Spring secured a divorce she
was given the custody of the three minor
children and SlD'i per month alimony. At
that time Spring conducted a large cloth- j
ing store at the corner of Santa Clara and j
Market streets and owned considerable i
property. He was estimated to be worth I
nearly $100,000. As soon as the decree was .
â¢d he immediately transferred all his
propertyâ including the storeâ to Moore
and his sister and went East in an at
! tempt to avoid the alimony. In transfer- ]
i ring his interests the consideration "was i
love and affection and for the better sup
port of his sister."
Mrs. Spring has not been paid any ali
mony and there is now due her, including i
costs, $>92. In the complaint filed to-day !
she states she is without funds to prop- j
erly maintain herself and children, and
that her husband has disposed of his !
property with the deliberate intention of \
evading" the payment of alimony. She
wants the deeds given by Spring to his
sister set aside and the property levied
upon to secure the alimony. V. A. Schel
ler is attorney for Mrs. Spring.
The trouble of the Spring*; has attracted j
a great deal of attention because of the i
prominence of Mrs. Spring, who was
prominent in society affairs. Spring hint
self was popular with a certain class. He j
was Councilman at the time he fled from '
the city t<> avoid alimony. He maintained i
! many fleet hound? and was a steady pat
; ron of coursing. To these dogs, wine and
I women of the sporty set is attributed his
1 downfall. Spring is now somewhere in
the East.
Mrs. Spring is now living at Belvedere,
where she lÂ£ maintaining a homo out of
her own private fortune.

Nash Is Elected Governor of Ohio
and Kentucky Remains Out of
the Democratic Column.
Bryan Succeeds in Saving Nebraska, but His
Party Is Snowed Under in Other Middle
Western Commonwealths.
SUMMARY OF ELECTION RETURNS.
o
O Election returns as summarized at 1 o'clock this morning show the results X
X to have been as follows: Â°
+ Ohio has been carried by the Republicans and Nash has been " Â©
<Â£ elected Governor by a plurality estimated at 25,000. At 12:30 â¦
Â§ o'clock this morning the Republican managers claimed that his Â©
-â¦- plurality would exceed Bushnell's majority of 28.000 in 1897. The o
O result is much mixed and Jones has been a surprising factor, hurt- -fi
q ing both candidates. +;
â 4- Nebraska has been carried by the fusion ticket by at least Â©
O 10,000 majority, which is sufficient to keep Bryan in the Presi- x
q dential race. +
â â¦â  Maryland elects a Democratic Governor, John Walter Smith Â©
Â© defeating Lloyd Lowndes, the present Governor, by more than +
o 10.000. " $
-â¦- Kansas gives big Republican gains. Â©
Â© Kentucky has gone Republican. -Â£
q Massachusetts has been swept by the Republicans by 70,000 ~
-â¦â  plurality. Â©
O New Jersey elects an overwhelmingly Republican Legislature. t
Â© lowa elects Shaw, Republican, by a largely increased Repub- +
Slican lead. Â©
2 In Ohio at midnight the returns were not sufficiently complete to Indicate X
just how large Nash's plurality over John R. McLean, the Democratic candi- jr
5p date, would bo. Nash' 3 majority will apparently be about, 25.000, but it is JT
Q growing and Republican managers claim that it will exceed Bushnell's plur- *?
.4. allty in 1897. In that year Bushnell (R.) defeated Chapman (D.) by a q
q plurality of 28,165. John R. McLean has apparently carried Hamilton County a.
-^ by a small plurality. This county in 1897 was carried by Bushnell (R.) by Q
$IÂ«00. â¦
â +â  Jones, the independent candidate, has been a remarkable factor. In some Â©
Â© sections of the State he has divided the Democratic vote: in other sections he -4
"â¦" has divided the Republican vote. He is described in the dispatches as one Â©
Â© of the closest thirds that ever ran. Jones' vote will reach 100,000 and is taken Â£
about equally from Democrats and Republicans. V_
Â© Colonel William Jennings Bryan has won in Nebraska what must be de- ,-j
"^ scribed as a personal triumph. At midnight the returns were showing great >
<-' fusionist gains. Colonel Bryan claimed that the fusionists would carry Â©
A the State by at least 15.000 plurality. More conservative estimates give the 4.
5Â£ State to the fusionists by a smaller majority, but by one which will, neverthe- Â©
fi less, be sufficient to keep Bryan in supreme lead for the Democratic noml- â¢â¦
--+. nation for President. Â©
O Returns from Kentucky indicate that William Goebel, the regular Demo- â¦
â â¦â¢ cratie candidate, who was indorsed by Bryan, has been defeated. The Â©
Â© militia was ordered under arms and the count was conducted amid scenes of "*"
â¦ excitement. The returns disclose that independent Democrats supporting O
O John Young Brown during the canvass threw their votes to Taylor in the i
* end In a desperate effort to defeat Goebel. ]7
Â© In Pennsylvania Lieutenant Colonel James E. Barnett has been elected X
"*" State Treasurer by the Republicans by an estimated majority of 150,000. This
Â© is surprising, because it was believed that the anti-Quay vote and disparage- q
"l merit of Colonel Barnett's courage while at Manila would result in a largely +
v decreased majority. Â©
q There was a light vote in Virginia, and the result indicates that the Legis- â¦
+â  ture elected will return United States Senator Martin to the Senate without Â©
f> serious opposition being made. -â¦-

COLUMBUS, Nov. 7.â After 11 p. m.
the returns showed the Democratic
pains in Cincinnati and other cities
were reduced an<i hat McLean was
likely third at Cleveland, and. pos
sibly, at Toledo, in which cities Jones
drew much more heavily from the Demo
crats than from the Republicans. At the
fame time the Republican net gains out
side of Cincinnati, Cleveland and Toledo
were increasing at such a rate as to in
dicate a plurality of from 30,000 to 40,000
for Judge Nash for Governor, and the
entire Republican State ticket, including
a majority of â  â .â¢â¢ Legislature.
Chairman Dick had, previous to the
election, repeatedly claimed the election
of the entire Republican State ticket by
not less than 6000 plurality. So far to
night he has refused to give any figures,
but those around him say that means
that he now has no reason to change his
lirst figures. The later returns seem to
be growing In favor of the Republicans,
especially since the returns indicate that
Jones hurt the Democrats much more
Than the Republicans in Cleveland, To
ledo, Columbus and other cities, while the
first reports indicated exactly the oppo-
Bite effect.
Judge Nash (R.) Is receiving the con
gratulations of his friends and neighbors
at the Neil House. After 11 p. m. he
said:
"I claim my election by at least 30,000,
but I am too much engaged to give a
statement of the causes or to analyze the
results for the press."
Bands and clubs are out serenading. At
11:10 p. m. Chairman Charles Dick gave
out the following:
"The returns from Hamilton, Cuyohoga
and I. neon counties are as yet too meager
to give finite figures. Enough have been
received to indicate the election of Judge
.Nash by a greater plurality than that of
Governor Bushnell two years ago, which
â¢was 28,165, thus insuring the election of
the entire Republican State ticket. Both
branches of the Legislature are Republi
can." 'â â â¢".*'

At 11:30 p. m. Chairman Beward of the
Democratic Committee was asked for a
â¢nent on the Ohio results, but de
clined to make one for the Associated
Press. He was then asked if he conceded
the election of Judge Nash or claimed the
election of McLean, to which he replied:
"1 will say nothing."
There were no Jones legislative or other
candidates, but Samuel M. Jones, Mayor
of Toledo, is certainly the closest third
that ever entered the Ohio gubernatorial
race. There is not the usual percentage
of either Republican or Democratic
or losses, as the gains run for the Repub
licans in some places and for the Demo
crats in other sections.
Hon. C. L. Kurtz, the Ohio member of
the Republican National Committee, who
is in Governor Bushnell's office figuring
returns, said:
"I regard the returns received up to this
time as insufficient to make a correct esti
mate fn thf vote for Covernnr. The firnt
precincts reported are usually the ones in
which there is a small vote and thr vote
Is less liable to fluctuation than in other
precincts. Hence it iÂ« idle to claim either

TOLEDO, Nov. 7. -Mayor Jqnes at 9
o'clock conceded his own defeat.
"If my race has contributed in any
way," ht' said, "to the BUCcesi 'if J"hn K.

"The result of th.- election is extremely

the claim that the cause has won the

CLEVELAND. Ohio. Nov. " 7.â Senator
Hanna received the election returns at the
Union Club. At midnight he made the
following statement:
"Under the conditions It has been a
splendid Republican victory. The returns
have come in so slowly that it is im
possible to say just how emphatic the
victory is. but it is a magnificent one.
It was an Indorsement of the Republican
party, and a splendid one. it is too soon
to say thai l am satisfied with the result,
for we do not know certainly what the
result Is. But we know enough to know
that it is. a great victory for \w party.
The result in Cuyahoga County is not
diffcrrin from what was expected, and
was due to local conditions which were
pretty well understood before the elec
tion. The result bo far as this county is
concerned has no real significance and,
while it is not pleasant, it is not a sur
prise. When the returns an- all in it will

saying anything more than that they
show a Republican victory."

MOST UNIQUE FIGURE
IN AMERICAN POLITICS
SAMUEL M. JONES OF TOLEDO.
Samuel M. Jones, the man who stirred things up so in Ohio yesterday, is prob
ably tho most unique (i^uro now in American politics. He is known as the "gold
en rule" Mayor of Toledo, and is trying his besi to apply the ethics of Christ to
everyday business life. As Mr. Jones says of himself, he was "fortunate enough
to be born of parents who were very poor." At IS he went to Pennsylvania, be
came Interested in the production of crude petroleum, invented a clover appar
atus, and now owns a big factory in Toledo in which the only regulations for the
workmen are big signs on the walls bearing in print the words of the golden rule.
The way Mr. Jones modernizes the grand words of the Savior is, "Do unto others
as it you were the others." His employed work eight hours a day, with numerous
holidays, on which he entertains them in splendid style. At Christmas he shares
with them the profits of the past year. He Bays the present system of production
and distribution is un.iust, and f. does all he can to equalize things between him
self and those he employs. When he ran for Mayor he had all the saloons, all the
politicians and all tho machines against him. He had nobody with him except the
wageworkers, but they elected him handily. Mr. Jones is a strong advocate of
municipal ownership of public services, and the basis of his proposed reforms is
Christian ethics. He was nominated as an independent candidate for Governor
and made a vigorous canvass of the State. The result of his canvass is to be
seen in the election returns from Ohio published this morning.

town missing was as follow?: W. Murray
Crane (R.) 165.846, Robert Treat Paine Jr.
(D.) 103,812.
The Senate of 1900 will stand 31 Repub
licans to 9 Democrats and the House 166
Republicans, 7" Democrats, 2 Socialists
and 2 Independents. This shows a loss of
two Republican Senators and three Re
publican Representatives. In addition to
the three Republican places the Demo
crats to-day have also tilled two seats
held by [ndepi ndenta last year. The Dem
ocrats of the First Middlesex Senatorial
District elected their candidates for the
first time. The Socialists lost a repre
sentative in Haverhill, but a member of
that party was chosen from the Fourth
Plymouth District, thereby giving thorn
the same quota as last year. The Social
ists at Haverhill made up for their loss
by giving their candidate fur Governor a
greater vote than that received by the
Democratic nominee. In other parts of
the State the Socialist doctrine was given
some indorsement.
The Democrats to-day had no diffi
culty in carrying the city of Boston.
For the past three years the city
had indorsed the Republican candidate
fir Governor, but this year Robert
Trent Paine Jr.. the Democratic nominee,
received a plurality of 6196 over W. Mur
ray Crane (R.). Paine's total vote was
32.502 and Crane received 26.:;:tt5. Last year
Wolcott <R.) carried the city by a
plurality of 1597 over Bruce (D.). These
figures show a loss for Crane from Wol
cott's vote of 7179 and a gain for Paine
over Briu'e of 911. The decreased Crane
vote is partly due to the fact that he
comes from the western part of the State
and did not have the local popularity that
Wolcott had. The Democrats made every
effort to rally a bier plurality to strengthen
themselves for the city election . next
month.
The expansion question apparently
played little part in the election, and
Senator Herbert C. Parsons of Greenfield,
where the question was an issue before
the people, was defeated. Mr. Parsons
ran independently and was assisted In his
campaign by a number of anti-expansion
ists from this city.
BIG GAIN IN IOWA.
Net Republican Increase About Four-
teen to Each Precinct.
DES MOINEB, lowa. Nov. S.-At 1:30
a. m. 686 precincts of the 2052 in the State
give Shaw (R.) for Governor 91,593; White
(I).), 07,565. The same precincts two years
ago gave Shaw 56.565, White 72,392. This
is a net Republican pain of 9553, or about
fourteen to a precinct. The same ratio,
if continued for the State, will give a Re
publican plurality of about 00, 000. There
are a few Republican gains in the Leg
islature, and the Indications are the Re
publicans will have 115 of the 150 mem
bers.
The indications are that the Republican
total vote will show a decrease of six
per cent from two years ago and that
the Democratic total vote will show a loss
of about ten per cent.
The probabilities are that there will be
eighty Republican members in the House
and thirty-five Republican in the Senate,
a net Republican gain of ten. It seems
that this strength is certain, and it is
probable that it will be increased when
all the returns are in.
Chairman Huffman of the Democratic
State Centra] Committee concedes the
State by 40.000. while the Republican State
chairman claims it will go 65,000 or better.
SALT LAKE REPUBLICAN.
SALT LAKK, Nov. S.â Returns up to

LEXINGTON, Ky., Nov. 7.â ln one precinct in this city to-night while the <
' count was In progress, a body of armed men, said to have come irom the Re- "
[ publican headquarters, attempted to enforce a fair count, as they claimed.
. Reaching the precinct, they were met by a number of police and citizens. *
â¢ Firearms were brought into use and about a hundred shots were fired. One ,
â¢ negro was wounded, not seriously. The attacking party fled and no arrests
â¢ have been made.
LOUISVILLE, Nov. 7.â At 6 o'clocK
this evening Colonel C. C. Mengel
received orders from Governor
Bradley to send to the polls at
once the Louisville Legion, which
had been under arms at its armory all
day in readiness for a call. Up to this
time the election had been one of the
quietest ever known here. The balloting
proceeded all day without any disorder.
A fc-w arrests for alleged interference
with voters were made, but there was less
than the usual amount of friction between
workers for the respective candidates.
When the polls closed at 4 o'clock the
Inspectors representing the interests of
the Brown ticket appeared and demanded
admittance to watch the count. This was
clone under an injunction issued by Judge
Toney cf the Circuit Court shortly before
noon, restraining the city authorities and
officers of election from interfering with
the Brown inspectors. About the middle
of the afternoon the Republicans secured
a similar order for their inspectors on the
representation that they were threatened
with interference.
In a number of places the inspectors
were refused recognition, and Governor
Bra'Jley's order for troops to go to the
polls was made upon a statement by
Judge Toney reciting this state of affairs.
Judge Toney's letter to Governor Brad-
Icy follows:

Judge Jefferson Circuit Court, Law and Equity
Division.
The men were ready, and within a few
minutes began to form about the armory.
Belts were loaded with ball cartridges and
every man had his bayonet fixed. Colonel
Mengel, who was in uniform for the first
time since the regiment was placed in
readiness for a call, assumed command.
As soon as the order became known
Sheriff Bell hastened to the armory and
protested against the calling out of the
troops, on the ground that there had been
no disorder and no trouble, and that there
was no occasion for action by the State
authorities; that Judge Toney had not
made any representations to him, the
Sheriff, as peace officer of the county;
that there had not been any interference
with his order. Colonel Mengel replied
that he was acting under instructions
from Governor Bradley.
Shortly after 7 o'clock orders to march
were given. Companies B, C and D
swung into Main street and started on
double-quick for the lower quarters of the
city in the West End. They visited poll
ing places en route and inquired into the
treatment of the representatives of all
parties. Everything was found quiet,
however, and the bluecoats were marched
back to headquarters. The only excite
ment noticeable was that occasioned ny
their presence. Meanwhile the count
was proceeding in all the voting places
of the city.
KENTUCY RETURNS.
Taylor Elected Governor by a Com-
fortable Plurality.
LOUISVILLE. Nov. 7.-By the com
bined efforts of the Republicans and anti-
Goebelites. Attorney W. S. Taylor (R.) has
been elected Governor of Kentucky by a
plurality variously estimated at about
10,000 over Goebel (D.). Returns up to
midnight also indicate the election of the
entire Republican ticket, while the com
plexion of the Legislature is in doubt.
The weather throughout the State was
perfect and more than an average vote
was polled, the total falling but little
short of the vote polled in the last Presi
dential election. Comparatively little dis
order prevailed, and aside from several
arrests for alleged violation of election
laws the election was characterized by a
remarkable degree of quietude.

FUSION WINS IN NEBRASKA.
Holcomb's Majority From Five to
Ten Thousand.
OMAHA, Nebr.. Nov. ".â Incomplete, re
turns from Interior counties. of Nebraska
show that Iloleomb, the fusion candidate
for the Supreme bench, ...is made pains
over he fusion vote of last year for Gov
ernor, which insures his election by from
50>'i<V to- .10,000 majority over Reese, the
Republican! candidate tor the Supreme
bench. Chairman Dahlman of the Demo
cratic State Committee pays his reports
to-night warrant the claim of 15,000 ma
jority for Holcomb. This conclusion Is
based on a proportionate increase if the
fusion vote. Chairman Edmiston of th"
Populist committee says thai Ilolcomb is
elected by at least 32,000 votes and pos
sibly more.
Returns from Omaha precincts indicate
substantial gains for Holcomb and smaller
gains for the Fusion ticket as compared
with last year. In forty-seven precincts
the total vote polled for Reese (R.) is Ls33,
as against a total for Ilolcomb (Pop. Â» of
4GOS. In these forty-seven precincts Ilol
comb gains .11 votes above the fusion vote
of last year. Holcomb runs ahead of his
ticket, and it is doubtful whether any
fusionlsts on the county ticket are elected.
Incomplete returns from the Sixth Con
gressional District show heavy gains for
the Republicans, and it is possible that
Kincaid (R.) may pull through in a dis
trict which for a number of years has
given a largo fusion majority.
LINCOLN; Nov. B.â Returns up to mid
night continues to show the same fusion
gain as earlier reported, and there is no
longer the leaÂ£l doubt of the fusion tick
et's election. Chairman Edmiton of the
Populist State Central Committee said:
"Wo have carried the State by 15,000 and
have made sains in county offices
Chairman TelTt of the Republican Com
mittee declined to make a statement, but
ninny of his associates admitted defeat,
though not conceding It by as large a

was defeated In this county. In Tyone
County, the entire Republican ticket is

The Republicans have elected eight out

A special courier arrived to-<.lay with In
telligence of the terrible fight between
Nettleton, the American, and Rossick, the
German, and Indians at Cajam hacienda,
near Bacum, last Saturday night. The
two men were overseers of the property.
At the beginning of the attack shortly
before daylight they made a brave de
fense and used thHr arms effectively, but
the doors of the hut were battered down
and In the hand-to-hand battle that en
sued Nettleton was shot and clubbed to
death.
Ressick, although wounded, was spared.
After taking ail the provisions In sight

"Why. he looks the picture of health."
"So he is. Tough as a pine knot. Ought
to live to be 100. But when we were
younger he was always grunting. He
i thought he had everything from gout to
i galloping consumption, and never ex
pected to live the year out. He averaged
a quart of medicine a day, to say nothing
of external applications." :
"What cured him?"
"I did. He growled so much that it
always gave me the blue devils to meet
him. ; One day he was telling me tne old
story of now his days were numbered and
how* he had complications enough to kill
an alligator in twenty-four hours. 'Jim,'
said I. 'you make me tired. Tcu're just

"Did he take it?"
"Jumped at it. Insisted on paying $1000
down so as to make It more binding.

and take on flesh. He was worrying
about the money I was getting lnstea.'. of
about himself, don't you see? I caught
him five years running, and since that

LONDON, Nov. 7. â It is announced in a cable dispatch from Cape
Town dated Sunday, November 5, that the British have been victorious
in an engagement at Ladysmith and ttyat tfye Boer loss was very heavy,
ncluding 2000 prisoners.
ESTECOURT, Natal, Nov. s.â Natives confirn) the reports that the
Boers received a crushing defeat between Colenso and Ladysrr)ith. Tr;e
Boer force, however, is still encamped at Pieters Station. T^e Boers'
losses on Thursday and Friday are stated to be about 1000 in Killed and
wounded, besides many prisoners. It is reported trjat a party of Boers are
going down through XX)t Weenen country in the direction of Pietermaritz
burg, and are attempting to induce Natal Boers to join them.
LONDON, Nov. 7. â News has just arrived from Mafe^ing showing
th)at up to October 25 the Boers continued the bon)bardn)ent, firing as

and wounding only four n)en. Tfyat day tf)ey closed in all around tf)e

dispatches from the front have, rent the

showing the British garrison not merely
Btandlng on the dogged â¢ naive, but
executing a series of brilliant sorties.
Accounts from different sources agree
that the laconic official description of
Thursday's engagement as "an effective
shelling of the Boer laager" was unduly
modest. It appears that General Sir
George wart White sent a strong: force
of cavalry and Infantry to attack the
BoerÂ« at Tatham's Farm, about ten miles
to the northwest, nenr Besters, and ap
parently achieved a surprise, the Boers
being caught on the open veldt and cut
to pieces and their camp captured. En
couraged by this success General "White
decided to risk an even more Important
engagement on the following day, which
was again justified by success.

THE FEAR OF HUMBUG
Prevents Many People From Trying a
Good Medicine.
Stomach troubles are so common and Jn j
rr.oEt rases so obstinate to cure that peo- \
ple are apt to look with suspicion on any I
remedy claiming to be a radical, perma- !
nent cure for dyspepsia and indigestion, i
Many such pride themselves on their
acuteness In never being humbugged, j
especially in medicine.
This fear of being humbugged can be
carried too far, bo far. In fact, that many
people suffer for years with weak diges-
tion rather than risk a little time and
money In faithfully testing the claims
made of a preparation so reliable and uni-
versally used at Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets.
Now Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets ore
vastly different In one Important respect
from ordinary proprietary medicines for
the reason that they are not a secret
patent medicine, no secret Is made of
their ingredients, but analysis shows
them to contain the natural digestive
ferments, pure aseptic pepsin, the diges-
tive acids, Golden Seal, bismuth, hy-
dra."tis and mix. They are not cathartic,
neither do they act powerfully on any
organ, but they cure Indigestion on th-Â»
common sense plan of digesting the food
eal^-n thoroughly before it has time to
foment,' sour and cause the mischief.
This is the only secret of their success.
Cathartic pills never have and never
can cure indigestion and stomach troubles
because they act entirely on the bowels,
whereas the whole trouble is really in the
Btomach.
Stuart's Dyppepsla Tablets taken after
meals digest the food. That is all there-
Is to it. Food not digested or half di-
gested Is poison, as It creates gas, acidity,
headaches, palpitation of the heart, loss
of flesh ana appetite and many other
troubles which are often called by some
other name.

Friday had descended upon Colenso and
as shown by the dispatches from Estcourt
had compelled a hurried abandonment of
Colenso and a retirement of the British
to Estcourt.
General White had ascertained that the
Boers were attacking Colenso, but ho was
not aware of the British retirement. He
had determined, therefore,- to attack the
Boers in the rear, thus hoping to achieve
the double object of drawing off an at
tack upon the weak garrison of Colenso
and possibly of reopening communication
southward. The Boers had advanced
southward until they had occupied the
hills north of Tugela River and dominat
ing Colenso on the other side of the
stream. The hills 6lopo to a plain that
reaches to the banks of the Tugela.
General White's division caught the
Boers in the rear and after the hills had
been shelled the British infantry stormed
the position. Meanwhile the British cav
alry swept round the hills and a? the re
treating enemy descended into the plains
with British bayonets behind and the
river in front of them they were charged
by the cavalry and seem to have perished
almost to a man. The British then re
turned to Ladysmlth without coming Into
touch with the Colenso garrison, which
had retired to Estcourt.
Sunday's dispatch from Estcourt, how
showed that an armored train had
been sent back to Colenso to repair the
lice and the next news may possibly re-
Btore communication "With Ladysmlth.
While the British troops were thus en
gaged In successful endeavors to wipe
out the Nicholson's Nek disaster the situ
ation inside Ladysmith. as shown by an
official dispatch from the general at Est
court was most satisfactory, encouraging
a hope that Sir George Stewart White
may yet completely retrieve his shaken
reputation and that his force may emerge
triumphant from the ordeal through
which it is now passing.
General Lord W.Â«lseley, the commander
in chief, haa written to Lady Randolph
Churchill thanking her for the efforts of
the American ladies In England in fitting
out a hospital ship for South African
waters. He says: "I am only too anxious
to help you In this matter, in order to
chow you how thoroughly our army and,
indeed, the nation, appreciate the evi
dence of the Interest American ladies
take in our sick and â wounded."
The Maine will sail for the Cnpe on
November 25 with Lady Randolph
Churchill on board.
BOERS ROUTED WITH
VERY HEAVY LOSSES
LONDON, Nov. B.â Evidently more de
tailed reports of General White's doings
at Ladysmith must be received before the.
| public will be able to form a clear Idea
lof what has happened. Reports from va
j rious sources show that another Impor
i tant reconnoissance or engagement oc
curred on Saturday to the south of Lady
mlth, and a Cape Town newspaper re
ports that 2000 Boers were captured there.
The suggestion of Sir Redv'era Buller
In his dispatch to the War Office on Sun
day that the name of General French had
been given by mistake for that of Col
onel Brocklehurst in advices to him by
pigeon post from Durban is now explained
by a dispatch from Pietermaritzburgwhich
pays that General French has left Dur
ban for Cape Colony. Evidently General
Buller was aware of this.
The Dally Telegraph publishes the fol
lowing dispatch from Pietermaritzburg',
dated Saturday evening:
"Since their occupation of CoJenso the
Boers have attempted no advance further
south. Bstcourt is now becoming a strong
and growing camp. Major Wolfe Murray
Is In temporary command. The enemy
bombarded Colenso on Thursday until
Bunset at the extreme range of nine cen
timeter Krupp guns.
"Confirmation has been obtained of the
report that General Schalkberger is the
Boer commander at Vryburg. A general
Boer advance is not thought probable.
Means have been taken to secure Pieter
maritzburg against any possible attack,
and also to relieve Ladysmith before- the
enemy can come farther.
"Whispered rumors of both Dutch and
native origin have been current since yes
terday that during a reconnoissance from
Ladysmith northward, toward Matta
wans Hook and Nicholson Nek, the Brit
ish troops engaged the enemy. It is said
that a lyddite battery drove the Boers
Into a valley, where the British cavalry
charged them. ThÂ© Boer losses In this
engagement are said to have reached 1000,
the British losses being only about 100.
"It is a fact that General Joubert drew
In his line to-day and that the Boers now
only have outposts at Colenso. Runners
are bringing the names of the Boers who
were killed and wounded outside Lady
6mith, and tholr reports â¢ have caused
much mourning among the relatives.'
According to special dispatches from
Estcourt, the Boers on Thursday asked
a day's armistice. General White agreed
to this on condition that they would
make no movement. The British military
balloon, however, detected Boers massing
to the south, and General White there
upon renewed the attack.
Boer reports have reached Cape Town
to the effect that on the arrival at
Johannesburg of the news of the Boer re
verse at Elands Laagte, the whole Rand
special police force was sent to the front
with guns from Johannesburg forts, the
fortress being left with only gun, .and, ,

a garrison of twenty men.
ThÂ© men of the Eighteenth Hussars
who were captured at Dundee, first took
refuge In a Kaffir kraal, where they
fought stubbornly, only surrendering
after four Krupp shells had exploded In
the kraal.
A largo Boer force has been ssnt to re
inforce General Schalkberger on the Tull
border.
The Boers have repaired the railway be
tween Volsrust and Newcastle.
BRITISH TROOPS CLAIM TO
HAVE SLAUGHTERED BOERS
ESTCOFTIT, Natal, Sunday, Nov. 5.1:30
p. m.â A reliable native has brought con
firmatory evidence of Friday's tight south
of Ladysmith. A reconnalsance in force
was made by a British division, the ob
ject being to relieve the Colenso column,
which had been attacked by the Boers.
The British infantry charged the Boers,
who were strongly posted on Glob^skloof
Hill, and drove them down on the plain
toward the Tagnla River, when the
British cavalry, executing a fine Hanking
movement, charged the Boers, almost an
nihilating thorn. The plain was strewn
with dead Boers. An armored train has
aK:iln left for Colenso with a company of
the Dublin Fusileers and a railroad en
gineering staff to repair the line. No fight
ing is supposed to have occurred Satur
day, as no firing was heard.
ESTCOURT, Natal, Sunday evening,
Nov. 5â It Is now possible to furnish offi
cial details of Friday's fighting around
Ladysmlth. The Boer artillery fire was
accurate and well sustained but ineffec
tive. The British cavalry was constantly
out, the investment not being close
enough to prevent this. Cavalry and ar
tillery under Colonel Brocklehurst about
noon drove the enemy away from all
! their positions with great slaughter. This
attack was directed against a reported
move of the enemy toward Maritsburg.
The artillery shelled three of the enemy's
guns into silence. The British casualties
were slight.
The Boers are now shelling the town.
Their artillery is w^ll handled, hut Is
doing little damage. The Boers profited
by a flag of truce on Thursday to sptu!
in a Transvaal artillery officer, disguised
as an ambulance driver, with the wound
ed, to observe the action of the Boer
artillery fire.
TREACHERY FOLLOWED
BY A BAYONET CHARGE
DTRBAN, Nov. 5 (Sunday 1 ), C:SO p. m.â
A native eyewitness of Thursday's bat
tle near Ladysmith says the Boers were
caught on the open ground and raised
several white flaps.
The British then advanced without fir-
Ing to accept the surrender of the Boers,
but were received with a volley at close
range. Enraged at this treachery, the
Lancrs, Hussars and Dragoons, fol
lowed by the infantry with fixed bayo
nets, charged through and through the
enemy and did great execution. A lot of
prisoners and loot were captured.
Another battle on Friday with the
Boers was proceeding, according to the
natives In the south, with similar re
sults.
POWERS HAVE TAKEN
NO STEP TO INTERFERE
BERLIN, Nov. 7.â The recruits of the
Imperial Corps dv Garde took the oath of
allegiance to-day in the Kustgarten In
the presence of the Emperor and his staff
and the foreign officers. As each brigade
was sworn, his Majesty took his stand by
Its colors. Addressing them all In turn
In a loud voice, the Emperor reminded
the guards of their oath, saying: "A
man's word Is his bond," and exhorting
th^m to do their duty as "soldiers and
Christians."
Regarding the alleged scheme for arbi
trating the Transvaal question, a semi
official statement has been issued as fol
lows:
"Nothing whatever \b known here of
any common plan of action upon the part
of Russia, France or Spain In the Trans
vaal question. In any case. It may be
positively stated that no such plans have
been brought to the knowledge of the
German Government from any quarter
whatever, and therefore it has never been
In the position to reject any such or
similar proposals."
STRENGTH OF THE BOERS
WAS UNDERESTIMATED
LONDON, Nov. 7.â The confession last
evening of. General Lord Wolseley, the
commander In chief, that the Boers were
more powerful and more numerous than
had been anticipated, sufficiently ex
plains the present happenings, and the
War Office will hereafter have awkward
questions to answer In regard to Its ap
parent colossal ignorance of the Boer
strength, which both In number of men
and excellence of artillery is apparently
a complete surprise to the British military
authorities. Mail news from South Africa
shows how inaccurate have been the esti
mates of the Intelligence Department and
the. Government experts. It is gleaned
BULLER'S REPORT OF THE
LADYSMITH BOMBARDMENT
General Joubert Refuses a Request Made by
White to Permit the Departure of
Non-combatants.
LONDON, Nov. 7.â The following Is the text of a dispatch from General
Buller, from Cape Town, dated November 7, 12:55 p. m. :
"The following dispatch has been received from the general commanding at
Estcourt, dated November 6:
" 'Since Friday there has been a cessation of hostilities. A note was sent that
day to General Joubert by General White, at the request of the Mayor, asking
permission for the non-combatants, sick and wounded, to go south. General
Joubert refiiFed the request and agreed to allow them to go to a special camp
four miles from Ladysmith. The townspeople refused to accept this offer. The
sick and wounded and a few of the Inhabitants were moved yesterday. A few
shots were exchanged yesterday at the outposts. Friday's bombardment was
heavy. She-lie fell In the hospital and one burst in a hotel during luncheon. No
one was injured. The only casualty in the town from the shells thus far is a
Kaffir killed.
" 'There was a smart action Frldny toward Drwdrop. The troops under Gen
eral Brocklehurst drove the Boers back a considerable distance and disabled a
gun. There wa.^ also fighting near Bulwana. Our loss altogether is eight killed
and about twenty wounded. Ninety-eleht Dundeo wounded have arrived. They
were sent here Saturday. All are doing well.
" 'The position here is now believed to be entirely eafÂ©. It has been greatly
strengthened during the last twenty-four hours. The people have deserted their
dwellings, and are living in bombproof places, safe from shell fire. There is
plenty of good stores of all kinds.
" 'Captain Knapp and Lieutenant Brabant werÂ« killed in Friday's action.'
"The foregoing is an exact copy of a press censor telegram brought here by a
Kaffir runnner. There is no other official news."
therefrom that a fair estimate- of the
Boer forces Is as follows: Around Lady
pmlth. 25,000; traversing Zululand, 4oOO;
advancing on Burgherdorp, 5000; Coles
burg, 3000; Klmberley, 7000; Mafeking,
4500, and on the northern Transvaal
border. 2000.
Exact Information about the Boer ar
tillery Is lacking, but it is known that
General Joubert's detachment before it
was reinforced consisted of sixteen Krupp
field pieces of the latest pattern and two
heavy Cruzot Btege guns, which but for
the opportune arrival of the British na%-al
brigade would have rendered Ladysmith
untenable.
In connection with the naval guns a
most interesting and Important experi
ment has been successfully carried out at
Cape Town with a 4.7-Inch gun, so service
able at Ladysmith. One of the British
cruiser Terrible's guns, mounted on a
Scott traveling carriage, was fired In the
same way as a field gun with entire suc
cess. The Terrible, with a number of
guns thus mounted. Is on her way to
Durban, and though the guns cannot now
reach Ladysmith, they may be of great
value In the defense of Pietermaritzburg,
which It seems will probably have to
stand a siege. The arrival of the Terrible
with the relief crews for Csilna and
other available men, must have: placed In
the neighborhood of 30.000 more men at
the service of the military authorities.
TWO ARMY CORPS TO
BE AT ONCE MOBILIZED
LONDON, Nov. B.â A Dally Mall repre
sentative In informed that the Second and
Third army corps are to be Immediately
mobilized and that a division consisting of
ten thousand men of the Second Army
Corps will be dispatched to South Africa
as Boon as the necessary arrangements
can be completed. The Second Army
Corps will conÃist in round numbers of
some 40,000 men. It will be made up as
follows: Thirty Infantry battalions, three
batteries of Royal Horse artillery, eigh
teen batteries of field artillery, and ten
regiments of cavalry. The cavalry force
will thus be far In excess of the usual
proportion of that arm to the infantry,
but It is concluded that the war ofHce pro
poses to equip a special cavalry division, a
course which the nature of the warfare
and the character of the country in South
Africa render necessary.
The Third Army Corps, but a purely
nominal affair, will number at the outside
some 25.000 men. It could not be brought
up to its full Btrength without the aid of
the militia. It will be required for garri
son purposes, as nearly every military
station in the kingdom will be denuded of
troops by the concentration of the Second
Army Corps at Aldershot. The mobiliza
tion of the Second and Third army corpa
is absolutely without precedent. It will,
of course, involve the calling out of the
reserves of those regiments which arc on
the list.
RHODES' SIEGE AVENUE.
HOPE TOWN, Cape Colony, Saturday,
Nov. 4.â A dispatch which hay been re
ceived here from Klmberley dated No
vember 1 says:
"Apparently the Boer reinforcements
from Mufeklng have arrived, as the bur
ghers are more numerous and closer
around Klmberley. About 1200 of thtm
made a demonstration three miles east
ward at Premier mine to-day and opened
fire on the De Beers carts, but no damage
was done.
"The explosion of the dynamite maga
zine, caused by the Boers firing the place,
was terrific. The huts contained thirty
five tons of dynamite, valued at Â£3500.
"All the wounded arc progressing- satis

WHAT DEFEAT WOULD MEAN.
COLOGNE, ..ov. 7.â Letters received by
the Cologne Gazette from Johannesburg,
dated October 13, said the- Germans there
indignantly repudiate the telegram to
Emperor William, signed by Colonel
Schlel, which in no way reflects the feel
ings of the Germans of the Transvaal.
As a matter of fact, it is declared Schiel
was not responsible for the objectionable
character of the dispatch, as he was ab
sent at the time it was sent. The letters
reaffirmed that Kaffirs were being con
veyed across the border in gangs of 1000
to 5000, and that the escorting Boer forces
were robbing them of a considerable
amount of their savings. Foreigners, it
also appears, were being stopped in the
streets and compelled to give up the
money in their pockets. One letter con
cludes: "As long as the Boers are vic
torious Johannesburg has nothing to
fear, but if beaten the town, with all the
mines, will soon cease to exist."
BRITISH SHIPS ALERT.
LONDON, Nov. 7. â Interesting 1 news
comes from the channel squadron at Gib
raltar, showing precautions against all
eventualities almost unknown in Euro
pean waters in peace times. On the way
to Gibraltar the fleet spread out four
miles apart and a sharp lookout was kept
for suspicious craft. At Gibraltar extra
sentries are posted at night at different
parts of the ships with ten rounds of ball
cartridges each. The small guns on the
upner deck and in the fighting tops are
kept ready for immediate use. The am
munition being on deck and a few men
sleeping at the guns, the searchlights are
kept working, all boats are hailed and
not allowed to approach without the per
mission of the officers of the watch.
KAISER AND CZAR.
BERL.TN, Nov. 7.â The Tageblatt sees In
the Nord Deutche Allgemeine Zeltung's
article of welcome to the Czar a two-fold
reference to the Transvaal war. The ar
ticle hails the Czar as an exponent of the
old-established and much-prized friend
ship and amicable co-operation between
the two empires in Europe, and signifi
cantly points out that, thanks to this
friendship, the two powers can proceed to
a Joint solution of the problems outside of
Europe, adding that It looks for benefl
j cent results to the world's peace from to-
I morrow's meeting.
NATAL DUTCH TOOK PART.
ESTCOURT, Natal, Nov. s.â An armored
train went over the Tugela bridge yester
day, found Colenso Intact and also found
the road and railway bridges strong. An
Orange Free State force was sighted six
miles from Colenso on the Ladysmlth
Bide. It was supposed to have been en
gaged with the British forces from Lady
smith Thursday. The Boers suffered heav
ily. It is rumored that the Natal Dutch
took part In the engagement, siding with
the invading Boers.
FIGHTING AT MATEKING.
CAPE TOWN, Nov. 7.â A dispatch from
Kuruman dated Friday, November 3,
gays a dispatch rider arrived there from
Mafeking that morning, announcing that
Colonel Baden-Powell had captured a
number of mules and horses. Fighting
was occurring daily at Mafeking, all, it
was added, in favor of the garrison. Na
tives report that Colonel Plumer's force
from Tuli Is working Its way from Rho
desia to relieve Mafeking.

THE COMMISSION'S REPORT.
THE preliminary report of the Philippine Com
mission has been before the country for several
days and has not seemed to impress public
opinion or change the situation in the least.
The report is a compromise between the individual
opinions of the members of the commission. The
utterances of President Schurman before his appoint
ment were as pointedly against imperialism as any of
Edward Atkinson's. Colonel Denby declared that we
wanted the islands regardless of the interests or pro
tests of the people, but only because they would
probably be profitable to us, and if they were not
we did not want them at all. Professor Worcester's
book on the Philippines, written merely as a narra
tive of. his personal experience and observation in the
archipelago long before we dreamed of its conquest,
is a mint of material for argument against having
anything to do with it. Admiral Dewey is indis
putably on record as declaring the Filipinos as better
qualified for .â¢eminent than the Cubans. These
individual views are ail canceled in the report. It
begins with a statement of the reason given by the
natives for the revolt against Spain which began in
1896. It is characterized as not a movement for in
dependence at all. Quoting the native proclamation
which stated its basis, the report says: "The insur
rection was solely to obtain relief from intolerable
abuses. It demanded the expulsion of the friars and
the restitution to the people of the lands, with a
division of the episcopal sees between Spanish and
native priests. It demanded that the Filipinos have
parliamentary representation, freedom of the press
and religious toleration, economic autonomy and the
benefit- of the laws of the kingdom of Spain. It de
manded the abolition of the power of banishment,
and equality of all persons before the law, with equal
pay for Filipino and Spanish civil servants.
:â¢. concludes that the people who
and fought for them are in
â¢' Bclf-governmo
an who knows the history of his country
â¢ by the exact resemblance between
*nd the demands upon England which
r,wn Revolution. Our forefathers be
: .gland for parliamentary rep
:;, for economic autonomy, for disunion of
â¢ d 'tatc, for legislative independence. These
rejected led to the declaration of Thomas
c that "these colonies are and of right ought to
be free and independent States," and inspired the
speech of Patrick Henry to the House of Burgesses,
we hope, a classic of American patriot
â 
inos who could formulate such demands
and â  them were endowed with the active
gen: '-ndence.
The commission reports that it examined many
upon the subject of the capacity of the
people for self-government, and as a result of the
testimony concluded that that capacity doe? not
I Therefore this Government is justified in de
cmd in making war against the natives until
-i de=ire it are all killed or effectively sub
jugated.
Our Declaration of Independence says: "We hold
the*e truths to be self-evident, that all men are cre
ated equal, and with certain inalienable rights,
among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of hap
â¢ 1 that to secure these governments are in
stitut< ' .' men, deriving their just powers from
n=rnt <ii the governc!."
After that Declaration was adopted Mr. Jefferson
went home to Virginia and put its precepts in prac
tice in that colony. He abolished tithes, thus sever
ing the connection between church and state, and
destroyed primogeniture, establishing family equality
in inheritance, and forbade the entailing of estates.
This republic has developed on those lines. Are we
to continue thereon or abandon them? is the real
â  m in issue in the Philippines and wherever our
â  liction goes.
The commission generalizes upon benevolent pur
poses, and promises what is to follow conquest.
These generalities and promises are offset by the
riral facts that such relations have never yet
blished between conqueror and conquered.
Equality between them has never yet occurred. It is
between the Irish and the English, after seven
centuries of domination by the conqueror. It is not
between the English and their Indian, Burmese or
Cingalese conquests after nearly two centuries of
contact He is a hopeful prophet indeed who can
look for it between us and the people of a race so
different as the Filipinos.
The Declaration of Independence includes "all
men" in its statement of equality of right.
The great fart, disowned by the commission, is that
all men have rapacity for self-government. It is
born with them into the world. The forms by which
ir is accomplished differ with racial characteristics.
There is self-government everywhere in the Philip
pines outride the American lines, and where it is there
anarchy. Last January an official report to our
Department said that, in addition to his mili
tary expulsion of Spanish sovereignty from the four
islands of Luzon, Panay, Negros and Cebu, Aguin
'a government "was administering government
with dignity and justice."
The commission concludes its rhapsody with that
which is the real reason for the position in which
this Government has become involved. This is a
- â  of the wealth of the islands in agriculture,
minerals, timber and trade, of which "the United
State* will obtain a large share." This part of the
rt reads like the Englishman's reason for the
P.oer war: "If you had a chance to seize a billion of
gold in the Transvaal mines wouldn't you do it?"
THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1899.
ONCE MORE MAYOR PHELAN.
ONCE mi re a â  ' ""- 'â  " iber of Republicans
have cast their votes for and one or
two of his colleague* on the Democratic
I ticket to elect them to office. Th:s is the third time
' that Mayor Pheian has profited by that vote, and it

The Call opposed Mayer Pheian and the whole
Democratic ticket because it believed that upon every
â  .. â  â¢ . -epub'.icar. ticket would provide
ity with a better administration. Now that the
test is over and the vote discloses that a majority
â¢ the citizens desire Pheian to have another term

to n. .11 recogr.ize him as the :hiei executive

made the plea that
a new charter g ger powers he would do much
to promote advancement That plea re
peated day after day through the years has had its
effect and long before the campaign began a senti
ment in favor of g .a term of office under
the r.ew charter had been elaborately cultivated. We
are r.ow to Bee 1 be the outcome. An effort
to c t 1 >ns of the new charter ;
ar.d with an eye single to the public
good will be sustained by The Call, but any attempt
to use the powers of the Mayoralty either to supply
patronage to the Democratic bosses or to advance
the political foi Pheian himself or any of his
t imptly exposed and condemned.
To the Honorable Horace Davis the Republicans
of the city owe a political debt of more than ordinary
extent. He entered the campaign as a matter of civic
duty. His reputation, established by years of distin
guished service to the community, both in public and
in private life, was already high, but it has been in
creased by the manner in which, under trying circum
stances, he conducted the campaign. He was met at
the outset by d( in the ranks of his own party,
and some of these were made under circumstances
which were sii '-xasperating. Spies were set
upon his tracks and every action of his life was noted
by men eager to discover something which malice
could distort into wrong. He was caricatured and
lampoon" . \-:vely. All this he bore
with serenity and kept on his way with the unifi r:n
dignity and c are the distingui
marks of a true gentleman and an honest man.
His defeat is due to no fault of his own. Even
those who voi insi him will bear testimony to
his high character and his worth. He would have
laid the foundations of government under the new
charter upon right principles and would have es
tablished precedent? of immense value in shaping the
policies of future Mayors. It is to be regretted that
he has been defeated, but the regret is not on his
part, but on that of his feliow-citizens.
In conclusion it is but just to point out that Pheian
and his organs repeatedly declared during the cam
paign that nati rties had nothing to do with
the issue, and that his success would not mean a
Democratic victory. We shall now see whether they
will be true to that declaration after the contest is
ever and it is no longer necessary to delude Repub
lican voters.
The coming Congress will have to attend to busi
ness from start to finisl . and big business at that, for
the people expect of it the settlement of the mone
tary standard, the reformation of the currency, thy;
undertaking of the isthmian canal, the construction
of a Pacific cable and the promotion of the Ameri
can merchant marine.
BRITISH NAVAL STRENGTH.
rOR some reason the British Government has
taken advantage of the opportunity of the
in South Africa to make a demonstration of her ,
naval power on a scale far more imposing than any
thing in the situation seems to justify. The Boers
have not only no navy but no seaport, and such re
ports as have been circulated of the probability of
the Transvaal Government issuing letters of marque
to privateers are hardly worth serious consideration,
and yet British fleets have been set to work with as
much vigor as if the empire of the seas were at stake
in the conflict.
Dispatches from London announce that while the
channel squadron has been stationed at Gibraltar to
be ready to act with the Mediterranean fleet at any
moment, swift cruisers are on watch at Las Palmas,
St. Vincent and other points on the route to the
Cape; British warships are continually passing and
repassing through the Suez canal, and what is styled
a "particular service squadron" has been ordered to
make ready for sea. Thus the British have estab
lished an immense naval patrol along the whole
coast of Africa and are guarding the Mediterranean
front about as vigilantly as that around Cape Colony.
If the purpose of the Government be to give notice
to the nations of Europe that Great Britain is able
to hold her own against any interference that may
be attempted, the demonstration has been well de
vised. Certainly a striking illustration has been given
of the naval power of the empire. Within a month
Great Britain has arranged to transport an army of
60,000 men across 6000 miles of ocean. She has ac
complished the feat without seriously disturbing her
great commercial steamship lines, and she has pro
vided the money to defray the cost without levying
any increased tax upon her people. Now to add to
the effect of the lesson she mobilizes fleets sufficient
to patrol the coast of a continent without materially
weakening her squadrons in any other part of the
world.
It is not likely the immense cost of the vast dem
onstration of power on the seas has been undertaken
without good cause. There is at present no evidence
of any intention on the part of the powers of Europe
to interfere to prevent the conquest of the Trans
vaal, but there i^ no telling what might happen should
a serious reverse be suffered by the empire in that
part of the world and the war be prolonged. The
British statesmen evidently believe it just as well to
let the powers e re what the strength of the empire
is and how effectually Britain can hold her own else- \
where while battling in South Africa.
In this emergency the British are enjoying the
benefits of the wisdom which guided them in building
up their merchant marine in time of peace. Thanks
to the subsidies granted through a long course of
years, the Government has found at its disposal an
> supply of swift steamers for the transport of
troops and of sailors to man them. It now clearly
to be seen that the money expended in promoting the
merchant marine has not been wasted, nor has the
construction of a powerful navy been foolishly under
taken. Without the strength which her statesmen
have bui't up on the seas in times past Great Britain
might now be confronted not by the Boers only but
by one or more European powers demanding of her
the surrender of Egypt, and the struggle might be
on her part not for the extension of empire but for
its very existence.
Whatever may be the differences of opinion among
our people upon other subjects, ail who truly desire
the welfare of the coast are united in the opinion
that the Pacir.c Coast should have a representative on
Interstate Commerce Commission, and that the
man for the place is W. R. Wheeler.
PROSPERITY IN ThE SOUTH.
BY an examination into the conditions of the
is district- 1 Los A gelea is the
center the Tirr.es of that city has obtained
â¢ â¢ re has been a full and com
plete recuperation from the ill effects produ ed il
section oi i by the double disaster of the
collapse of the real estate speculation of the boom
times ad the depression brought about by the
financial panic of 1893. The showing is one which
be g â  "ng to all Californians and merits more
than a passing notice.
In Los Angeles itself the Times estimates that
new buildings now in process of construction by pri
ite parties, ai â¢ â¢ ie work, have a
I combined n of more than $500,000, an.:
add a number of fine business houses, residences,
churches and manufacturing establishments to the
city. There is said to be plenty of money for the
needs of enterprise, and a canvass of the banks re
: veals an increase of many millions of dollars of de
its over those of last year.
Similar reports are given of conditions in the sur-
I rounding â¢. In Pasadena new buildings of ail
: kinds are being erected, there is a general activity in
business, and so completely have the people recov
! ered their sanguine, progressive spirit that it is prob
able large municipal improvements will be under
taken which will add much to the attractiveness of
the place bcth for residence and for business.
It is noted in Pomona that the ranchers are plant
ing more orchards, and in many cases pear, prune,
apricot, olive trees, etc., are being uprooted and re
: placed by orange g Merchants are increasing
their businesses, and the houses which are being
' constantly built are generally of a more substantial
character. Five oranee-packing houses there have
been enlarged this season. The real estate market
has been decidedly active. There is no dearth of
capital.
At Whittier it is said there have been large move
ments of capital toward the development of oil wells,
water facilities and the handling of fruit. It is esti
mated that in the past year $200,000 has been invested
in the oil industry alone. From Riverside the reports
say: ''Remarkable activity is shown all along the
line. During the past year more orchards, have been
; ianted, more acres set to grain and more buildings
erected than during any like period, not even except
ing the boom days, in the history of Riverside. Es
tablished concerns in all lines of trade are doing 20
' per cent more business than at this time last year."
From Anaheim, Santa Ana, Redlands, Ontario,
Santa Barbara â in short, from every center of busi
nc-s throughout that section of the State â equally
good reports are made. In two respects the reports
are everywhere the same â there is ample work for
labor and wages are good. In most places there has
been an increase in the rate of wages, and the wage
earning population is sharing in the prosperity of the
property-owners.
OUR CONSULAR SERVICE.
OUR consular service is one of the things on
which experts differ so much it is dimcult for
outsiders to form a definite opinion concern
ing it. Time and again efforts have been made to re
form the service, and elaborate statements have been
made of its defects, but in each instance the efforts
have been defeated by the presentation of facts tend
ing to show that the service is about as good as can
be made.
The consular reports issued by our Government
have repeatedly won the commendation of British
and other European authorities on commercial sub
jects, and they certainly give evidence of a good deal
of care on the part of the consuls in seeking out in
formation likely to be of value to American exporters.
On the other hand, there have been made many kinds
of complaints of a lack of training on the part of the
men engaged in the service; a lack which it is said
puts us at a disadvantage with European merchants,
who are aided by their skilled and well-trained rep
resentatives abroad.
The subject was recently discussed at the com
mercial congress, and the weight of opinion appeared
to be that there is needed in the consular service a
better educated class of men than we now have.
Robert Adams Jr., who as Minister to Brazil had
occasion and opportunity to study the subject, said
our service is not satisfactory and not up to the
standard of that of other countries. Consuls, he de
clared, should speak the language of the country to
which they are sent, or at least French; they should
pass a special examination for their positions and
have tenure for life, or at least during good behavior,
and there should be a chance for promotion held out
to them as an incentive to d^o good work.
Mr. Adams attributed the defects of the system to
the manner in which the consuls are selected. "Our
foreign representatives," he said, "are now appointed
through political influence, and it would be impos
; sible for any President to stand up against the pres
sure brought on him to make such appointments. It
is the system that must be changed, and it is strange
that our up-to-date business men do not give the
matter their attention, for whatever the business inter
ests demand for the benefit of American trade they
ultimately get."
Owing to the rapid expansion of our foreign com
merce the subject has become one of more import
ance than ever. Granted that the service is in many
respects excellent, that many able men represent us
as consuls, there remains the fact that improvements
may be made in it. and it is worth while to set about
the reforms at once. As we have to compete with the
nations of Europe for commerce we must have in the
field representatives just as well trained as those pos
sessed by a European country.

MIDWAY BETWEEN THE
POLE AND THE EQUATOR
SHAFT TO BE ERECTED AT NORTH PERRY, ME.
CALAIS, Me., Saturday.â A singular mark of honor, and yet one to which it
is naturally entitled, has Just been conferred by the United States Government
upon North Perry, a little village situated In Washington County, about twenty
one miles from this city. That hitherto insignificant hamlet Is located midway
between the equator and the north pole, ar.d tnlfl memorable fact is to be noted
on a shaft which will be erected within the next few days at one of the most
central points in the village.
Tlvre is one church in North Perry, and the shaft will be placed on one
side of the little path leading from the street to the church door. On the front
of the pillar will be cut the words, 'Thia stone murks latitude 45 degrees north,
half way from the equator to the north pole."
Naturally this unexpected incident has set the people of North Perry in a
flutter of excitement. Thf-re are only about five hundred persons in the place,
and while the men earn their living by acting as guides to hunting parties and
by working in the lumber camps, the wonr?n and children earn a little- money in
the spring and early fall by picking berries and sending them to the canning fac
tories. Not often do they take a holiday, but they are determined to have one
on the day when the shaft is placed in posil
The stone, which has just been completed at a granite quarry near here, was
ordered by the Government, and the spot which U will occupy has been marked
by the geographical surveyors of the States Government as being pre
cisely mldv.-ay between the equator and the north pole.

"The action of some people in the

he tells his supporters that If they hold

thisâ that the people were disposed to be

ELABORATE PLAN OF
THE BOER CAMPAIGN
LONDON, Nov. B.â The Standard's cor
respondent at I,uxombourg gives further
derails of the Bopt plan Â°f campaign,
which was drawn up, he asserts, by a
"general of European reputation."
Dr. L^yds obtained from several gen
erals In Germany and Belguim, as well
as In Holland, a t-eries of highly Inter
esting plans, although there Is no reason
that the general whose plan
was accepted ever imagined It would be
put Into execution. The correspondent
says:
"The portion included the seizure of the
coast railway north of Durban by an at
tark through Zululand, or by way of
Greytown and Umbolt. Thus throughout
Natal offensive tactics were suggested,
but In the Orange Free State the plan
proposed a defensive policy baaed on the
strategical advantage given by the posi
tion of the Orange Free State on the
flank of the railway north of De Aar
Junction, and trusting to the Orange
River and the obstruction of the railway
bridges to induce tho British to advance
through Kimberley to Blo< mfonteln or
thri'Ugh Mafeking and Pretoria.
"me isoers are aavisea in tne scneme
not to oppose either 'if these moven
In their earlier stages, but to operate on
the lino of communications, namely, 150
miles from De Aar to Kimberley and 250
miles from Kimberley to Mafeking. Dr.
Leyds has been assured that if the Boers
can hold out two months the European
powers will Interfere. It Is clear, there
fore, that the only way to disconcert their
plans is to obtain the right to dispatch a
third army to Delagoa Bay."

Embassador Says That All Europe
Hopes for a Speedy Settlement
of the Troubles in South
Africa.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Nov. B.â The Morning
Post to-day makes the following
announcement:
"We have received a dispatch
from Washington respecting Anglo-
American policy in tha far East
which is of such a nature that it Is
desirable at the present juncture
to withhold it from the public until
we are able to confirm or deny It."
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7.â The Russian
Embassador, Count Casslnl, who is just
back from a long visit to Europe, was
seen at the Russian Embassy to-day and
talked in a most entertaining manner on
International questions which have en
gaged public attention. Count Casslnl has
been prominently Identified of late with
the Chinese situation, as It has been
stated that on hla return here he â would
make known to the President and Secre
tary Hay the desire of the Continental
powers of Europe that the United States
should Indicate what port or sphere of
influence in China It desires to occupy.
"I saw many prominent public men
while In Europe, including Count Mura
vleff," said Count Casstni, "and I assure
you that this is the first time that I have
heard that such a proposition was to be
submitted to the United States. In my
talks at St. Petersburg, Paris and else
where many phases of the Chinese sub
lect were discussed but nothing abso
lutely nothing, occurred to warrant any
report that I individually, or with others,
have any special inquiries to make con
cerning China. To be sure, this and a'l
other current topics are Informally dis
cussed, but it can be stated positively
that I return without any special mission
to perform and without Instructions re
lating to China."
Count Casainl said It was difficult '.o
understand the recent agitation over an
"open door" in China.
So far as Russia Is concerned," said
he, "her door stands open. The great
commercial port of Talien-Wan has been
made free to the commerce of the world
by formal proclamation.
"No discriminations are made against
the commerce of foreign countries, and
Russia enjoys no special privileges at this
port."
<'oncerning the Identity of Russian and
American Interests in ( hina, Count Cas
sinl said Russia was now buying rails and
railroad supplies from the T'nltod States
to build the Trans-Siberian Railway
through Manchuria; moreover, the Em
bassador pointed out that there as else
where the traditional friendship betw.-vn
the Russians and the Americans existed.
As to European b< ntlment concerning
the Smith African war. Count Cassini
Bald: "Of course all Europe is watching
this contUrt with profound interest and
concern. Rut It Is the interest of ob-
Bervers, and there Is no suggestion or
thought of any intervention or move of
any kind from outside quarters. Tlv> ! a
of life which is occurring is particularly
regrettable, and it Is to the lnterei
all that peace should be speedily re
stored."
"A Prophecy."
Sessions of the State Woman Suffrage
Association to-day at Golden Gate Hall

Laboratory Burned.
PRKSCOTT, Ariz., Nov. 7.â The labora
tory at the assay building and the entire
outfit connected with It belonging to the
Valverde Copper Company at their larg*
new smelter at Aqua Fria, now Hearing
completion, were totally destroyed by fire
last night. Included in the establishment
was one of the most expensive balances
ever made. The loss Is placed at $^om.
The lire will cause a delay of three waeks
in Mowing in the smeller. Work was
commenced to-day on a new building and
a new outfit has been ordered by tele
graph.
Chinese Laborers Riotous.
HONOLULU, Oct. 31.-The Chinese con
tract laborers on Waianae sugar planta
tion created a small riot this morning by
their attempts to secure the release of one
of their companions, who was arrested
yesterday for assaulting a foreman of ho
company. They gathered about the jail
a hundred strong and threatened to use
force to free their countryman. Se-en
police officers were sent to the i.cene of
tho trouble this morning: from Honolulu.
Meanwhile the Deputy Sheriff and tho
plantation hands at Waianae kept the
Chinese at bey.
SUISSER'S FSAE
IN JURY'S HANDS
No Verdict Reached at
Midnight.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SALINAS, Nov. 7.â The sole topic of
conversation in Salinas to-night is will
George Suisser, who killed Sheriff Farley
on the night of September 18, atone for
the act by capital punishment. The jury
In the case has already been deliberating
several hours and at the present time
there is no immediate prospect of a ver
dict. Knots of people were gathered to
gether at various places discussing the
subject, while at the Courthouse a con
course of citizens male ami female,
waited patiently for the jurors to decide.
The entire day was devoted to argu
ment, a most brilliant appeal being made
on both sides. District Attorney Andres
sen made a most telling argument this
afternoon in closing the case for the peo
ple. C. F. Lacey for the defense related
the entire course Suisser pursued during
the three days before the fatality and
expostulated vehemently with the jury
that the poor wretch who committed the
crime was not responsible and further
more that the majority of the wit:;
for the defense were virtually neg
witnesses and hedged questions whenever
possibleâ so great was public opinion
against Suisser ttiat they dare not try to
assist him.
Judge l>nrn gave an exhaustive charge
to the jurors and at 4:45 they retired, to
the amazeme-nt of some, who thought the
men would not leave their seats. The
j'iry balloted several times and at 6
o'clock went to supper. On their return
they could not agree and remained lit
the* same condition until a late hour to
night. The jury was locked up at mid
night. ,
TIRE IN THE HOLD.
Vessel Arrives at Boston With a
Cargo of Cotton Ablaze.
BOSTON, Nov. 7.â The American tramp
steamer Winifred, commanded by Captain
Langhorne, arrived here to-day from
Galveston, October 28, with cotton. In her
forward hold on fire. The vessel's cargo
consists of 5150 bales of cotton, consigned
to New Kngland mills. On the second
day out from GalVeston smoke was dis
covered Issuing from the forward hatch.
Steam was at once injected into the hold
and by this means the tire was held In
check, although not wholly extinguished.
The steamer continued on her way here
with the fire smoldering among the bales
of cotton, but there was no danger to ihe
chip.
Just how serious the fire is cannot be
ascertained until some of the bales . re
removed. The value of the ship's cargo
is about $250,000.
Sues a News Agency.
LONDON, Nov. 7.â The Court of Queens
Bench to-day granted the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Company a
rule for criminal Information against t.ie
Echo and a London news agency for
publishing a report of the alleged founder
ing of a British troopship on November 1,
In which the name of the company's

a number or years ago, said a well
known court official, "when United States
Hupreme Justice Brown was on the bench
in this city, I was assigned as it member
of the staff to interview the Judge at his
home out on Jefferson avenue. I recol
lect that as the servant ushered me into
the hall I observed a lot of ruses scattered
here and there and that as I stepped upon
the clean spaces along the corridor I dis
covered that the floor v.-as waxed to a
magnificently slippery decree. I was
forced to move with mincing caution far
from graceful.
"Approaching the library door i saw a
rueâ a white bear skin, 1 believe, and re
solved to make a leap over it. With a
Epring I vaulted, my foot landed on the
rug, the rug slid away and down I went
flat upon the floor. Meanwhile Judge
Brown had arisen from nls library table
and, noticing my mishap, he began laugh
ing. Reaching me, he helped -me to my
feet and remarked with assumed dignity:
" 'Look here, sir. Don't you know that
In thlÃÂ«age, this land and this house, such
servile formality is not at all necessary?'

FIELDS WERE
VERY LIGHT
AT TANFORAN
Due to a Misunderstanding of
Orders â Four Favorites
Were Beaten.
Owing to mismanagement or misunder
standing with the Southern Pacific Com
pany, quite a number of horses carded
to start at Tanforan Park yesterday were
not on hand to answer the post call. Some
of them were en- route from Oakland,
while others were loaded on cars at In
gleside, with no engine to pull them out.
Secretary Green Bald it was the fault of
the horsemen themselves as much as the
railroad company. However, the latter
Is pinched for cars and motive power, and
the blame an probably be laid at Its door.
As a consequence, the fields looked like a
Kansas village after a tornado had paid
its respects.
The first choices celebrated election
day, but four times finishing behind tirst
money. Tommy Burns landed two win
ners by clever horsemanship.
Choteau, a Montana-bred colt, made
away with the first purse. The distance
was six furlongs, and he led from start
to finish, going to the post second choice.
Champion Rose, the favorite, finished last.
The field in the seven furlong run was
reduced to two startersâ Faversham and
Jennie Reid. The black horse closed a
slight favorite over the mare and showed
his heels to her the entire route. Tommy
Burns sat astride the loner.
Billy Randall attached himself to the
third purse through the medium of his
sprinter Tullamore. The Inspector II
gelding took the lead when asked by
Songer, winning in galloping style from
Lsabelle. St. Aignon, the extensively
touted favorite, hied away in the timber
most of the way, finally downing 1 Flam
away for the show. Two to one was laid
against Tullamore.
When Meadowthorpe warmed up just
before the mile run he showed signs of
lameness, as usual, and the local talent
Immediately placed him on the lobster
list. It Ib an old habit of his, so it would
seem, for when Burns shook him up the
last sixteenth he forged ahead and led
SocialiPt, the 9 to 10 favorite, out a head.
Be Happy, played for a good thing, ran
a good third.
Opponent experienced no difficulty In
disposing of his company in the mile and
a quarter run. A 7 to 10 choice, Devin
laid away with him to the stretch, when
he moved up and won with considerable
to spare. In a hard drive, Reolia downed
J. B. Morris a head for the place.
The closing live furlong sprint went to
Frank Phillip's speedy colt Ravenna.
Potente, the favorite, showed first into
the stretch, where Ravenna, under Burns'
urgent riding, took the lead, and at the
wire was first by a couple of lengths.
Campus was third, two lengths behind
the iirst choice.

The Chess-Playing Pope.
In his days of illness ]>co XIII finds I
his chief amusement in chess. His regu
lar partner is Father Qiullo, a Dominican
monk. The Pope and the monk have been
playing against each other for over twen
ty-one years, and it is yet undecided
which is the superior. When Leo, shortly
after his enthronization, introduced the
royal game in the Vatican some ascetic
Cardinals raised an outcry, invoking the
decision of the Council of Treves, which i
forbade priests to play chess. The Pnpe \
listened to these fanatics with a superior
smile "U bis lips. "I know all you want
." be remarked, "and I toil you that '
Bishop Petrua, who first thundered !
against chess, and the Treves Council j
were both mistaken. The latter's decision â 
soon fell into disuse, and my namesake,'
1-eo X. openly averred that there was no 'â 
harm In chess playing. Even the fact that '
Martin Luther, his adversary, was a pas- |
sionate chess player, made no difference." j
In fact, both the Pope and Luther thun

POWER OF COMPTROLLER
TO ASSESS BANKS
IMPORTANT DECISION OF THE
COURT OF APPEALS,
Judge Morro-w Hands Down an Opin
ion of Great Interest to All Na
tional Banks in the
United States.
A decision of the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals was handed down yes
terday by United States Circuit Judge
Morrow In the case of J. Frank Aldrlch,
receiver of the Tacoma National Bank,
vs. Louis D. Campbell, in the District of
Washington.
The vital point at issue was as to the
power of the Comptroller of Currency of
the United States to enforce the collec
tion of assessments In the case of In
solvent national banks. In the opinion
the court holds that the Comptroller of
the Treasury has jurisdiction to enforce
by assessment the individual liability of
the stockholders of an Insolvent national
batik equally and ratably, and not one
for another, to the amount of their
stock In the bank at the par value there
of.
Acting with this clearly defined author
ity. Judge Morrow holds that the order
of the < "omptroller directing the assess
ment 1p absolutely conclusive upon the
stockholders of the bank, and cannot be
controverted by them in any defense they
may seek to interpose against the action
based upon such an assessment. The par
value of the stock of a national bank la
$100 for each share.
It appears that the Comptroller, In the
progress of proceedings In liquidation of
the Tacoma National Bank on April 27,
1896, levied an assessment equally and
ratably upon all the shareholders of the
bank at the rate of $Gfi per share. This
â  ment belnÃ $35 per share less than
ttiH par value did not exceed the Juris
diction of the Comptroller to raise within
that limit by assessment upon the stock
holders of the bank funds to keep the
contracts, deeds and engagements. On
January 20 the Comptroller levied a sec
ond assessment of $17 per share, making
a total of $82 per share. These two aa
sessments being together $18 less than the
par value of the stock were within the
jurisdiction of the Comptroller to make
in the proceedings which he had instituted
to wind up the affairs of the bank.
Against this second assessment, the
court holds it Is no defense, either at
law or in equity, to say that the first
assessment was more than sufficient to
pay the contracts, debts and engage
ments of the hank. Whether that assess
ment was sufficient is a question which
the law has placed wholly within the
power of the Comptroller to determine,
and without some showing of fraud, ac
cident or mistake it must be deemed by
the court to have been insufficient, and
the necessity for the second assessment
conclusive.
Judgment of the court reversed and the
case remanded with instructions to sus
tain the demurrer and dismiss the bill.
CAUSES OF SUICIDE.
RECENT writers in many countries
agree that suicide la on the In
crease, but the causes that they
assign vary all the way from the
weather to the decline of the or
thodox religious faith. Dr. W. W. Ire
land gathers their conclusions In an ar
ticla in the Journal of Medical Science for
July, and the London Lancet makes an
abstract of the article as follows:
The records collected by Durkhelm
in 1897 show that there are always
more suicides during the six warm
months of the year (April to Septem
ber). This apparently holds good for
all countries In Europe. Thus, of ev
ery 1000 suicides per annum from 590 to
600 are committed in the warm summer
season, and but 400 In the rest of the
year.
A steady and rapid increase Â«f self
destruction is common to the whole
civilized world. "It is most marked in
those countries which take leading:
parts in the world's doings." Dr. D.
R. Dewey has recently been studying
the question in the New England
States of America, He finds that since
IS6O suicide has Increased about 35 per
cent. In Massachusetts It has In
creased in thirty years (IS6O to 1890)
from 70 to 90 to the 1.000.000 living, and
In Connecticut from 61 to 103 per 1,000 -
000. Norway seems to be the only
country in Europe where suicide is
diminishing. The latest figures given
by Dr. F. di Verce show that "suicide
haÃ In Italy continued the movement
of ascent which Is proper to it, rising
from Â«<0 verified cases in 1872 to 1343 in
ISSI and to 2000 in IS9S." All who have
made a special study of this subject
have arrived at the conclusion that
there is in Europe and North America
a steady increase in the number of sui
cides. Some writers say that it is
mounting in Europe at the rate of 50.
--000 a year.
Different causes have been assigned
by sociologist*! for thin formidable
rife. Dr. Fehr, In his learned work,
'Influenza as a Cause of Insanity
(Copenhagen, 189S), states that in Den
mark after the severe and widespread
epidemic of this malady in 1887-88 there
was observed a rise In the number of
BUicidea owing to the mentally de
pressing and debilitating effects of thl3
disease. Dr. Ireland traces the great
er portion of the cases of suicide to
severe strain upon the nervous sys
tem which may be the outcome ot a
multiplicity of causes. Among these
causes may be mentioned the Increased
strain of modern life upon the nervous
system, and this is said to be paral
leled by the steady increase in Insanity
In modern times. Dr. Ireland's
studies on the lunacy returns
of Norway, Massachusetts, Ire
land and of various parts of
the continent accord with the conclu
sions arrived at by Koch, Kollmann,
Cettlngen and Luiner, who have made
laborious studies on this question â
viz. , that there Is a real increase of In
sanity. Dr. Ireland also lays stress
on the decadence of orthodox religious
belief In the great towns. "It Is In
great cities like Paris, Berlin and
Vienna, where agnosticism abounds,
that we have tho greatest number of
suicides.
In a recent Issue of the Revue dcs Deux
Mondes (May, IS9S). an article appears
from the pen of Louis Prool, entitled "Sui
cides from Poverty In Paris." In that ar
tlcle, the muse of suicide was found to be
the difficulty of obtaining constant work
and the low state of wages of some em
ployments.

Lost His Horses at a Funeral.
At Lamarque's funeral In Paris the
crowd took out General Lafayette's
horses as the famous soldier was return-

carriage to his hotel with many evidences
of enthusiastic love and admiration. The
scene was a stirring one, and a friend in
referring to it some weeks afterward said,
"You must have been very much pleased. '
Lafayette looked at him for a moment
In silence, and then said, with a whimsical
smile: "Yes, I was very much pleased
very much pleased, indeed. But I never
saw anything more of my horses, my dear
friend."â Argonaut.

BEATEN BY
CORNELL
Shut Out at Football by a
Score of Twenty-Nine to
Nothing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 7.â Cornell and Co
lnmbia were well represented at Manhat
tan field this afternoon when the foot
ball teams from Ithaca and the local uni
versity met on the gridiron. Columbia
was a pronounced favorite, odds of 5 to 4
being laid on the blue and white, but the
wearers of the red and white had plenty
of backing. The Ithacan rooters got all
the cash, as well as the glory, as Cornell
won, shutting out the Columbia team by
a score of 29 to 0.
The weather conditions were perfect for
a good game. Fully 35,000 persons wit
nessed the contest. Of these 12,000 passed
through the several entrances and crowd
ed the .stands and bleachers. The re
mainder were packed like sardines on the
big viaduct and along the new road upon
the heights to the westward. "Coogan s
bluff" and the surrounding points of van
tage overlooking the enclosure afforded
accommodation to thousands of dead
heads, who joined in the cheers and col
lege yells which were continuously echoed
and re-echoed from the field below. The
red and white of Cornell was more plen
titfully distributed than the Columbia
colors, but the crowds seemed to be equal
ly divided in its allegiance to the rival
teams.
When Cornell scored the first touch
down and kicked thf> goal the Ithacan
sympathizers broke loose and the waving
mass of red and white flags and ribbons
extended over some forty acres of North
ern Gotham.
Columbia was very much crippled
shortly after the opening of the game
by losing the services of Wright at right
guard, who was disqualified for slugging.
A few minutes later Captain Wilson was
forced to retire and soon afterward Cor
nell scored, Walbridge running and dodg
ing for forty yards through Columbia's
players and planting the ball behind the
line. Young Kicked the goal and Cornell
counted six points. The remainder of the
first half was not productive of any score.
The second was full of good plays and
hard work, in which Columbia was at
times unfortunate. Cornell was always
the stronger and with two more touch
downs and subsequent goals. In addition
to a place kick by Young, 23 points were
added to Cornell's score. At the end of
the game Columbia had failed to tally a
point and the contest ended in Cornell's
favor with a total of 29 to 0.
The line-up was as follows:

STANFORD
DEFEATED
BY OLYMPICS
College Men an Easy Mark
for the Club's Strong
Team.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nor. 7.â
The Stanford football team met its second
defeat of the season to-day at the hands
of the Olympic team. The game was
played on the university campus. Tha
Stanford team seemed to lack ginger after
the hard game of Saturday, and the Olym
pic forwards had little difficulty in
ing big holes In the Stanford line for their
backs to go through. The Olympics de
pended almost entirely upon line buck
ing, using their backs and their heavy
guards, Cotton and Cadwallader, to good
effect. When Stanford had the ball they
relied upon end runs for their gains,
Fisher and Smith both making gains uÂ£
fifteen yards in this way. Stanford was
notably weak on the defensive, partly be
cause so many new men were tried in the
line. To the strengthening of this part of
the team the efforts of Chamberlain will
now be particularly directed. McFadden
played a line game at end. Cadwallader
Kicked off for. tne Olympics, Murphy mak
ing a pretty run-in of twenty yards. After
an exchange of punts Olympic got the ball
in Stantord's territory and bucked it
down the field, L/evy carrying it over for
a touchdown.
Murphy kicked off and the ball was re
turneu. Murphy getting it on Olympic's
thirty-five-yard line. Smith made fifteen,
around the end and Fisher four through
tackle. Murphy then tried for a field goal,
but the ball was blocked, McFadden fall
ing on it. Stanford tried the ends again,
but made no gain, and Murphy fell back
for another try at the goal. His drop
kick from the eighteen-yard line went
Bquarely over the bar for the second time
this season.
The Olympics made onÂ« more touch
down in this half. They bucked the ball
to Stanford's twenty-yard line, lost It on
a fumble and then Sheehy got it on Stan
ford's fumble and scored, Cadwallader
kicking goal. The rest of the half Stan
ford kept the ball in the Olympic terri
tory. Fisher making one fine end run of
eighteen yards.
The second half was a short one, and
the Olympic? gained another touchdown
by bucking the line.
The score was Olympic 16. Stanford 5.

OSCAR NAMED
AS ARBITRATOR
King of Norway to De
cide Samoan Claims.
Special DlKpStch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Nov. 7- !
Raving disposed of the question of the j
adjustment of claims arising out of the i
bombardment of Mataafan rebels in I
Samoa; the three governments signatory !
to the Berlin treaty are now devoting
their attention to the proposition to par
tition the islands. The claims treaty was
Htmed at the State Department to-day by
Seen tary Hay on the part of the United
States; Reginald Tower. British Charge
d'Affaires; on the pan of Great Britain
and Minister [urnm Yon Schwarzenstein
on the part of Gei many. King Oscar is
selected as arbitrator. An Important
urtlcle of the treaty â -.:â â - that the .
arbitrator shall consider the facts lead- .
ing up to the bombardment, and If ho j
should det^rniine that the bombardment .
was unjustifiable, then he shall award
damages against the nations. Great
Britain and the United States, wh >se
men-of-war shelled the native villages.
The treaty is so worded that it is open to i
the interpretation that the award shall :
be n-.ade, if the bombardment were justi- .
fied by the existing conditions and the
facts leading up therto, against th*Â» power :
whose representatives brought about the
conditions which necessitated the use of
force; and in this event Germany will j
have to pay the score.
Th" authorities are satisfied that the
arbitrator will find that the bombardment
was justified. In which event Germany '
will settle the claims. It is understood
the claims which the arbitrator will con- |
sider are limited to those made by citizens
or subjects of the three nation?, and the ;
natives will not be Indemnified for any
losses- they may have sustained.
It was stated at the State Department
just before the close of office hours this
afternoon that no agreement had been !
reached in the matter of the partition of
Samoa. As has been hitherto explained, â¢
the United States is to have Tutuila Isl
and and something to boot, and Great
Britain and Germany are attempting to
settle between them just what disposition :
shall be made of the other islands of the
group and compensation made therefor.
The officials say that no credence can be
placed In the reports published In Ger
man papers because of their contradictory
character. The department is advised of i
various propositions which have been
made, and it is stated to-day thai Gr^at i
Britain undoubtedly will " remain in I
Samoa, and Germany will be the nation to
withdraw, receiving in exchange the isl
ands in the Gilbert and Solomon groups.
Progress is being made in these negotia- |
tions and an early settlement is now
looked for.

END OF SIBERIA
EXILE SYSTEM
j / I \ IIP.EE hundred and eight years
I have elapsed since the first yean
have elap9ed Â«lnce the first di
3 cf banishment to Siberia was pro-
I nnunred. relates the New York Sun.
"*â . In that time 1,600,000 persons have
'â  been' sent on the lone: road, many .if them
j hardened criminals, others outcasts or
-do- wells, often more unfortunate
I than criminals, and still many others the
; victims of their religious or political opin
ions. Dissenters from tiie orthodox faith,
: the advocates of a constitution for the
state and cranks have been mingled by
the scores of thousands with those whose
oftenses against society deserved the se
verest punishment. All marched In the
common chain gang;* over the bleak route
that became a two years' journey by the
time Russia reached The eastern ocean.
The first arrivals after an advance of the
frontier were gangs of convicts. If one
asks where the Siberian exiles have been
| chiefly kept the answer is: "Anywhere
in that vast domain where Russian sol
diers have carried their flag-." Whether
sent away for their country's good or th,
victims of their Government's Injustice
the exiles have marked by their presence
every successive stage of Russia ad
vance to the Amur.
The present Czar has decided to close
1 this long chapter of Siberia's history as
a penal Colony. lie shares the opinion
which his father and grandfather held
: that this degrading use should no longer
; be made of a vast and splendid territory
There i? plenty of honest labor now with
which to build the roads and fortresses,
work the mines and till the Government
lands, services for which the compulsory
j labor of chain gangs has !â¢ i a employed.
! When Russia is Inviting millions of "her
j subjects to spread over Siberia and make
the wilderness teem and blossom she can
scarcely continue to send among them the
refuse of the western quarter of the cm
i i>ire. The tram] class, composed chiefly
| of escaped convicts, have already treated
some of the new settlements to very tin
pleasant experiences. Russia is on the
j point of relieving Siberia from the odium
] of being a penal colony, just as long ago
I sip- reliwed the Government of Perm and
| Orenburg from it and as England relieved
Australia.
The progress of Siberia, due to the
great railroads now two-thirds completed,
| the Improvement of river navigation, the
opening of large areas to farming and
i mining enterprises and the influx of hun-
I dreds of thousands of settlers has
j brought about a new era. The popula
i tinu this year is over 5.000,000. and 600,000
| emigrants have poured Into the country
since the beginning of 1896, Bo large a
, transference of settlers from one part to
i another of the same country has never
been witnessed before In so short a time
These pioneers are Russian peasants, and
many of them have been assisted by the
Government to remove to virgin â¢ lands
where they may secure larger farms.
They arc beginning to develop the vast
resources of the country. Last year there
was more wheat for export than found
transportation, though economists do not
count upon Siberia as a world's wheat
producer, believing that as the country
tills the wheat-growing area will be
! fully taxed to supply the home demand
Industries are keeping pace with agri
culture. They axe making and refining
sugar at Semlpolatlnsk. they are turning
- out Dig iron near the Iron mines and in
the Tomsk Government in IS9B about 13,000
men were employed In a large m rob of
establishments manufacturing thirty-nine
kinds of commodities.
The Czar's commission to devise a plan
to replace the transportation of criminals
to Siberia by Other punishments held its
iirst meeting on June 21. The details of
the proposed change require much at
tention. For some time the foot journey
of the convict bands has been greatly
shortened by the railroad. The time
sof-ms near when the journey will not be
made at all.

"sweating" is completed the leaves are j
dried, either slowly or by simple exposure
to currents of air, or rapidly by artificial

must be guarded against, and then, if all
the conditions arc- favorable, in six or

Wise's Ready Wit Saved the Widow.
There was an auction sale In the little
house, and one after another the widow's
few possessions fell beneath the hammer.
Presently the auctioneer took up a largo
bowl which happened to be full of sugar,
and the poor woman, anxious to save Its
contents, hastened to the next room to
find something in which to put them.
Just as she returned the auctioneer
cried, "Sold!" and the purchaser Insisted
that the BUgar was his. The widow

"No," replied the fellow, curtly. "1

"Aha!" cried tho man, turning to the
spectators. "What did I tell you?"

WITHIN the last few months a large number of handsome buildings have
been erected in the district about Steuart and Market streets. The .at
est addition to their number will be erected by Henry P. Sonntag of the
real estate firm of Bovee, Toy & Sonntag.
The building, a three-story and basement structure, will be situated on the
west side of Steuart. between Market and Mission streets. It will occupy a
187:6 north of Mission street, ar.d will cover a lot 3i>:lo by 137:8. The cost
will be in the n< ighborhood of $Sti,OOC.
r i"!.e sandstone, of which only the front will be constructed, the side walls
being of red brick, will be bought from local quarries.
The ground and second floors ot the building will be devoted to stores and
offices, while the large lofts above will be used for wholesale storage rooms.
The style of architecture is a ltght Renaissance. The cornice, a de'-p frieze,
is BUrmoiMited by a graceful balustrade, which relieves the otherwise some

Grover Cleveland's Bible.
Upon Grover Cleveland* writing table
in the library at Princeton lies the old
fashioned Bible, with covers of black
enamel, which was given him by his
mother when he first went away from
home. At the top of the cover, in a little
space surrounded by an ornamen;al bor
der, is Inscribed in gilt the name "S. G.
Cleveland?/' and upon the fly leaf there
Is a line or two of writing in a neat, pre
cise feminine hand, from which we learn
that the book was a gift to "My Son.
Stephen Grover Cleveland, From His Lov
ing Mother."
Colonel Lainont says that lie first saw
this Bible on the table In Mr. Cleveland's
law office in Buffalo, and other friends
remembered having seen it there. When
Mayor Cleveland became Governor the
book was generally on the bureau of hi 3
bedroom. When the Governor was about
to become President, Colonel La-mont
found the little Bible in the President's
rooms at the Arlington, and. handing it
to Chief Justice Waits, Miked him to use
it when he swore the new Chief Magis
trate into office.
There were about 41.000 witnesses upon
the plaza in front of the Capitol when
Stephen Grover Cleveland pressed his
mother's grift to his lips, and before it
was returned to him, Mr. Middleton, tho
Clerk of the Supreme Court, entered' a
formal record on the last fly leaf that it
was used to administer the oath of office
to Grover Cleveland, President of tho

The Irrepressible Small Boy.
This is a true story, and It really hap
pened in a New York family. It looks as
if it might be an old story brought up to
date or renovated for the occasion, but
it is exactly as the small hoy arranged it
and not to die edification of his family.
'l h< small i>oy was very fond of ice
cream. It never cloyed his palate. It
was with tii" same delight thai he saw it
each time brought on the table, and upon
each of these tiroes lie showed the ex
uberance of his feelings by crying tn
rapturous tones: "Oh-o-o! Ice cream!
Ice cream! Ice cream!' much to his
mamma's annoyance.
"People will never think we have Ice
(ream or anything else to eat," she said
to her son one day. "Now, we are going
to have company to dinner to-night, and
1 don't want you to say a word when r lie
lie cream is brought on." The small boy
promised. He really was a good little
boy. and he intended to mind. But when
the cream was brought on the old feeling
of rapture was so strong that he forgut
entirely and cried out as usual. Then he
! remembered and stopped short, looking
very repentant. He nad not intended to
erTT out. and his mother was mortified,
lie changed his tone entirely.
"We have ice cream almost every
night," he remarked carelesslyâ New
York Times.
Famous Laughing Plant of Arabia.
The seeds of the laughing plant of Ara
bia produce the same effect upon persons
as laughing gas. The plant attains a
height of from two to four foot, with
woody stems, wide-spreading branches ami
bright green foliage. Its fruits are pro
duced in clusters and are of a yellow color.
The seed pods are soft and woolly In tex
ture and contain two or three black seeds
of the size of a Brazilian bean. Their
flavor is a little like opium, and their
taste is swcot; the odor from them pro
duces a sickening sensation and is slightly
offensive. The seeds, when pulverized and
taken in small quantities, have a peculiar
effect upon man. He begins to laugh
loudly, boisterously: then he sings, dances
and cuts all manner of fantastic capers
Such extravagance of gait and manners
was never produced by any other kind of
dosing. â Ladies' Home Journal.
Appreciated the Book.
A story Is told of a well-known whist
player who imagined himself an au

play, he at last wrote and published a

player for his opinion about It. In about
a week the hook was returned to him
with the following letter:
"My Dear Sir; Your favor of the â

The Joke on the Jockey.
A well-known jockey relates mjith relish
the following little story, though the
laugh is decidedly against him. A few
years ago he was engaged to ride the
favorite In an important race. On the
way to the post he found himself canter
ing" alongside a rank outsider, the mount
of a Btaole boy who had only just com
menced riding.
"You'll have to be careful with that
brute, B." he remarked. "I've ridden
him before, and you'll never be able to
hold him."
B. thanked the crack for the hint and
said that he would "do his best."
Half way through the race the outsider
and another were in. front, with the
favorite close behind. Fancying that the
others were in difficulties, the rider of the
favorite shouted:
"Pull out, 8., nnd let me through! I've
got the race in Band."
The crack was mistaken, however.
Looking back, the stable boy replied with
a grin:
"I would, but I can't hold him:"
With which the novice let his horse
have his bend and shot away, the easiest
of winners, to t lie chagrin of the crai !..
who finished second.
A New Humboldt Story.
In a chapter of reminiscences of Yon
Bunsen anil his friends, in the October
Century, John Blgelow tells this anecdote
of Humboldt: "One day he was dhilng
with Mendelssohn, the banker, and. an
unusual thing for him. he was very silent.
His lies!, remarking it, observed to Hum
boldt that he was sure he must be ill.
'No,' said Humboldt. 'but I am in great
trouble. Only ten minutes before leaving
my apartments to come here I received
from my landlord a note informing me
that he had sold the house in which I re
side, and that I must move. I really can
not bear to move again.' Mendelssohn
gradually led Humboldt into conversation,
iluiing which be found time to write a
note and receive an answer to it. He then
took Humboldt aside and said: 'By this
note I learn that I am now the owner of
the house in which you reside. The con
d'tion. however, upon which I have be
come its possessor is that you continue to
occupy your apartment in it as long as
you live.' "
Is Immortal J. N. AliveP
All tlif way from Kansas City comes the
news of thf reappearance of the "Immor
tal J. X." an eccentric character known
td every railroad conductor from the At
lantic to the Pacific. Several months ago
it was reported that "J. N." was dead
but that Individual has again appeared to
prove, in the I inguage of Marak Twain
that the reports of his "taking off" were
greatly exaggerated. The "Immortal J.
N." ha? beer a prominent character since
the civil war. His mmd became addled
trying to solve the problems involved in
that great struggle and he has since been
a wanderer of the earth. One of his ec
cftntricitles is to go Into a newspaper of
fice ami will.' a column editorial about re
moving the pressure. Hi? efforts are never
printed, but this does not discourage the
"Immortal J. N T .." and perhays he will
submit another communication to the
same paper at thÂ« time of his next visit.â

She Forgot Her Husband.
Every once In a while one hears of some
one who forgets who. he is. but there Is a
peculiar circumstance in connection with
one woman who was lost for a time and
finally found by her anxious friends living
a quirt, humble life In a small village. She
had forgotten all about her former life,
and, though they have succeeded in
making her recall nearly everything, they
cannot get i'.er to recognize her husband.
The fact that her domestic life hadn't
been any too happy may have something
to do with it. It's ever so much simpler
than getting a divorce, to just "forget it."

11. GOOD LETTERS AND HOW TO ]
WRITE THEM.
A good letter is one which has goodness
in it. It is the easiest kind to write, that
is for some peopleâ pood people. It isn t
a question of spelling or of grammar or
of superior stationery, but one of heart
and spirit. You cannot fool people in a
letter any more than in your conversa
tion. A good letter must h.ave harmony j
and melody and sweetness. It must have
a genuine ring. It must exhibit the per
sonality of the writer. It may be râ
iÃrved or dignified or jocular or friendly,
according to the relations between the
writer and the person addressed, but it
must be honest ami kind. To produce an
all-around good letter the following ten .
things are needed:
1. A good, honest, kindly heart.
2. A correspondent worth writing to.
3. An abundance of good news.
4. An easy style of expression.
5. A knowledge of the relation of words.
6. Good paper, ink and pen.
7. The ability to write neatly.
8. The ability to spell correctly.
9. A convenient and undisturbed time.
10. Things that tit comfortably.
These are all easy except the spelling.
You cannot write a happy letter unless
you feel happy. Your temperament will
DÂ« almost as evident in your correspond
ence as in your conversationâ not noces- |
sarily In the words you use, hut in a cer
tain Intuitive impression which your let
tor is sure to create. This fact is not
easy of explanation, but it is nevertheless
true. If seasons of unhappiness are al
lowed free course they are sure to taint
your correspondence, and perhaps your
friendships. Be frank, outspoken, honest
in your letters, as in your conversation.
There must be no vacillating of purpose.
If you have anything to say which ought
to be said, say it, but say it kindly. If
honesty costs friendships, better lose the
friendships than be dishonest. Put your
own individuality into your letters. Let
the letter be your letter, a mirror of your
self. It is comforting to recognize our
friends even in their correspondence.
Select a correspondent who is worth
writing to. Of course it is possible to
write good letters to bad people, and per
haps it is they who need good letters
most; but when we are obliged to write
to undeserving people we do it more as
a matter of duty. We are not known by
the friends we decline to keep, but rather
by the friends we keep. If their person
ality and character are stronger than ours
they help us to measure up. The corre
spondence is to our advantage. We
gather inspiration and encouragement
from thoir lives. In making your list of
correspondents don't forget the old, neg
lected friendsâ the old uncle or aunt, or
the old friend of your father or of your
mother, who in the bustle and turmoil
of life is forgotten for months at a time.
IV. n't forget the schoolgirl chum of your
earlier years, who has perhaps been less
fortunate than you. In short, don't be
selfish.
If you have no good news to communi
cate, of course you cajinot easily incorpor
ate any In your letter, but there is a
happy way of making good news out of
little" nnd" discouraging things. If your
letter is simply a reply to one which has
been on your desk t<t weeks and which
you have procrastinated about many
titmee, you will probably approach the
task in the attitude of one who is about
to pay a worrying bill. Such letters are
about as heartless and speeches? as are
calling cards handed to liveried doorkeep
ers They square accounts, that is all.

Lesson No. 4.
We ?hall take up for our fourth lesson
the measurement of solids. We have al
ready learned how to find the number of
cubic inches or the number of board feet
in a piece of lumber. If the solid Is of
uniform thickness we find the area of one
end and multiply this by the thickness,
using of course, the same unit of meas
urement. The triangular solid is meas
ured by finding the area in inches of the
end A B C and multiplying this by the
length AD. The rectangular solid is
â  measured by finding the area of the rec-
solid contents of circular solids. If we
know the area of the circular end and
multiply this by the length we have the
solid measurement. Note the following:
exerci.-'' 8 !
1. If a cubic foot of ice weighs 992 ounces
find the weight in tons (2000 pounds) of a
rectangular block of ice 20 feet by 30 feet
and 5 feet thick.
2. A block of mnrble used for a step is 6
I feet long. The end measurements are us

B D and E F each 12 Inches. Find the
value of the marble at $1 20 a cubic foot.

shown in the diagram. C D is 100 feet; A
C is 3G feet; E F is 12 feet; F G is 2$ f .eet.
Find the cost of excavating to .he deptfi
of 12 feet at 30 cents a cubic yard.
I 4. A stick of timber of trlanciil'x shane
business inquiries require? a prompt an
swer, but friendship letters should not
be based upon the same mathematical
equation. Write because you want to
write, -nfft because you have a letter to
answer. Fill your letter with the bright
ness and ehper of your own life. If it
crosses a letter from your correspondent,
so much the better; 'there will be two
people agreeably surprised. "Be of good
cheer" is a much more encouraging greet
ing than "How do you do?"
Don't omit Baying kind things for fear
of mnkins mistakes in grammar.* The
grammar is of trifling account compared
with the thought and spirit. So much
the better if you can use correct English
and appropriate words, but Just so sure
as you attempt a literary style or "work
at it" lust so sure will your letter be a
miserable failure. The more you write
the better you will be able to write.
Avoid the stilted stiffness which is so
common between the ages of girlhood and
womanhood. Children and old people al
waya write excellent letters. They need
no cautions or directions. Use capital
letters where necessary, punctuate once
in a while and avoid the- common errors
of speech which are likely to grate on
the nerves, but don't stop to analyze and
parse your sentences. Go right ahead, as
In your conversation, giving "good mea
sure, pressed down, shaken together and
running over."
The paper should be white, or, if tinted,
it should be of a very light shade. The
ordinary four-page note Ts the most con
venient and most commonly used size.
Avoid odd and unusual shapes. Learn to
write upon unruled paper. Very little
practlep will enable you to keep your
lines straight and regular. Good paper
is not expensive. You cannot possibly
make a letter look well on a leaf torn
out of an old account bunk.
Use black or blue-biack ink. Thick, oily
ink and a scratchy pen are not accompa
niments of good humor. The penmanship
should be characteristic of yourself. It
makes no difference whether It is vertical
ot slanting, large or small, heavy or light,
so long as it is easily rear] and looks well.
Even bad writing if in straight and regu
lar linos may present a fairly respectable
appearance. The best results are produce J
with a stub pen and a bold hand. Don't
"cross-hatch" your letter. It makes an
noying reading. It is not quite as stingy
looking as to write social news on a postal
card, but there isn't much difference. The
principle, or lack of it, is the same. The
friendship which is weighed between a
postal and a 2-cPnt stamp is certainly
"weighed In the balance."
Do your best with the spelling. It Is a
department of education which cannot be
rushed. If you are a prior speller you will
have very embarrassing moments and
very little sympathy. Keep a small aic
tionary by; there is no safer rule. But
don't leave any good thing out of your
letter simply because you cannot spell it.
Choose a convenient time. You cannot
write your best if you feel all the while
that you ought to be doing something
else, any more than a lady can tafk her
best to the afternoon caller when she
knows all the while that the dessert for
dinner is boiling over. It isn't necessary
to dress specially for the exercise, and
you will write better if your room and
your desk and yourself are in a fairly
tidy condition.
Be sure that you have things to fit. If
there is any one thing which looks worse
than another It is a No. 9 lef.er when It
has been taken out of a No. 3-{; envelope.

"The firmness previously reported continues,
T>ut demand 1Â» not fj urgent as It has been. j
Buyers have apparently satisfied their wants
for the time, and there la no' buying of tan
portance for the future just at present. Not
withstanding this, however, there Is a steady
movement Into consumptive channels at full
previous prices, and holders are firm in their â¢
views, refusing to make concessions even to
move considerable lots.
"Prunes appear to have regained some of '
their lest ground, nnd only now and then will j
a holder concede anything for the sake of get- ,
tins rid of his goods. The principal dullness j
is noted in large sizes, which are in heavy sup
ply ami difijcult to move at full figures Four j
tize? are held at a slight premium for small ;
lots, but large lots would probably go at about
present quotations.
"Raisins are featureless. There is a steady
trade ar.J prices; tend upward, though no quot
able change Is likely under present circum
stances. California loose Muscatels are the
only ones moving in any Quantity, and every
thing goes immediately into consumption. For
eign ralshis are quiet and trade is limited to
.:ai;vt-ly Small orders.
"Reaches re quiet and un?han?reÂ«i, with
trade confined principally to small lots. Stocks
are more firmly held in all positions, but no
quotable ohange in price is noted. The ten
dency is upward, however, and any improve
ment in demand will force prices still higher.
"Apricots sÂ«ill In only a small way at full
prices. .Tiibbers are reluctant to let any of their
holJings go.
"Flrs are slightly easier under enlarged Â»up
plies."
The Cdip2t Trade.
In the current iÂ«sue at the American Carpet
and Upholstery Journal of Philadelphia tha
statement is made that the new line of '%,
Koods tor spring wholesale trade will not be
shown until about the lath of this month,
which is considerably later than for some years
past. The delay Is attributed to the heavy line
of business done during the past fall, which
has retarded siring preparations.
It Is believed that an advance of 5 cents a
yard en all the liner grades of carpets will be
i.ecessaxlly demanded and that at lÂ«ai 2'--i
cents a yard on ingrains will be added to the
present prices.
During October the leading manufacturers of
â¢uj.'h-ol?iery goods announced an advance of 10
per oent on cotton â stiles, curtains, table
covers and eimllar products. Advances hayÂ«
also been made In curtain poles, mattresses
and nearly every product connected with the
carpet and uphoLstery Industries.
Although there are a number of big lace cur
tain mills in America, it is a curious fact that
the only goods of this character shown at the
National Export Exposition in Philadelphia
ere from a f.'reign house.
Another advance was raada last month by the
linoleum and oilcloth manufacturers, which
van necessitated 'â > the extreme high price of
burlap and other ingredients which go Into the
r.iak:ng of these lloor coverings.
As an indication of the general prosperity of
the carpet manufacturers, one firm in Phila
delphia added during the last month forty-one
more looms, bringing the total amount of
loonis in their plant up to over 200; all running
on various grades of ingrain carpets.
The recent decision of the Hoard of United
Etau-s General Appraisers ha* put a duty of
10 per cent on the sea moss which has been
largely imported into the States from Canada
and used for upholstering purposes.
A great many changes and improvements
tiave boen taking place in the various carpet
mills in Philadelphia, all of which indicate the
fact that the manufacturers are beginning to
make some money and are willing to expend
It again in every legitimate channel.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
There Is no further decline in Butter, but the
market is depressed, with liberal supplies.
Ranch Eggs are scarce and steady. Dealers
say that some shippers in the country are be
ginning to mix cold storage Eggs In with ranch
In the attempt to palm the whole box oft as
ranch Eggs. This trick has been tried for
several years, but the commission merchants
are on the keen lookout for It, and the ship
per who resorts to this dodge hereafter will
simply have his ranch Eggs sold at cold stor
age prices, besides losing his reputation as a
slilpi'er.
Cheese stands the same.

V V tuy CITIES /
OBJECTIONS ARE
INCREASING IN
WATER SCHEME
Cuvellier Has a Big
Fight on Hand.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 7.
Tlie scheme for obtaining a municipal
vater supply has struck a big snag. The
losting of the Roberts wells is said by
several of the Uouncilmen to be too much
of an indefinite quantity to suit them, and
fcome believe that Captain Roberta should
be equally interested with the city In de
termining the value of his land. As it
is at present, Roberts" land Is worth but
very little, but li it shall be proved that it
can yield an adequate water supply it at
enco becomes very valuable. President
Howe, Councilman Mott, Barstow and
others do not think it a good business
proposition to spend fkWO on another
man's property merely to prove to him
how valuable it is.
When the matter comes up before the
committee of the whole there will be a
\ery lively discussion, and although many
have been hitherto restrained by public
bentiment and the fear of being credited
with "falling down." they are now deter
mined to express their views openly and
to demand that before any larger sum of
money be appropriated in the Initial stage
of the proceedings there shall be some
definite practical programme lined.
It is now stated that the Contra Costa
raonopoly is equally interested with the
city in knowing whether Roberts' land
contains a water supply or not, and It Is
paid a? authoritatively as any such state
ment can be made that Captain Roberts
has already been offered $60,000 by the
vater company. The city's option is for
5100,000.
' Mr. Cuvollier's sincerity and earnestness
are commended by the Council, but more
practical members think differently from
the member at large. Last evening -Mr.
Cuvellier referred the important matter
of extending the option for a year to Cap
tain Roberts' son, who happened to be in
the lobby, and on the strength of the
toon's verbal opinion ;ha i his father could
be depended upon to do what was right
Mr. Cuvellier wanted the Council to im
mediately appropriate $4:X>O, and did not
f-eem pleased wnen Mr. Mott suggested
that in a deal between the city and a citi
zen involving $100,000 it was hardly the
proper .thing to beckon over the rail and
take a nod of the head in place of a prop
erly attested bond.
Many citizens are also of the opinion
that it is Captain Roberts' place to prove
to the city that he has something to sell
worth tlo<\ooo and that it is not the city's
I>lace to prove it to him. The Council did
not mind putting $1500 into what is purely
v speculation, but now that $40tO is asked
there is very decided opposition.

IN A NOTE HE
SAID HE LEFT
HER FOR KEEPS
Zoe G. RadcLffe Will
Get a Divorce.
Oakland Offlco Sun Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 7.
The divorce suit of Mrs. Zoe Q. Rad
cliffe against Frank C. Radcliffe, who is
employed in the Southern Pacific Com-
B land department at a salary of
â¢ $1500 per annum, was up before
Judge Greene to- Jay, and the fair piain
lated her troubles.
She recalled that one day about two
years ago a messenger brought her a note
from her husband stating that he had
"left her for keeps" and asking her "to
kindly have his effects sent to him." At
that time the Radcliffes were residing
, with Mrs. Margueritte Williams on Van
Ness avenue, San Francisco, and accord
ing to Mrs. Radelifie she and her hus
i band had been at outs for some time,
though on the night before the husband
deserted there had been no dispute. "Our
troubles were caused because 1 did not
think that Mr. Radcliffe was contributing
sufficient to the support of myself and two
daughters," said Mrs. Radcliffe on the
witness stand. "I had to work hard to
help support us. For live years 1 nad a
situation In the Surveyor General's onice
i?nd Iso wrote stories for the newspapers,
and at present 1 have no Income. After
my husband left me I moved to Oakland
and from there to Alameda."
The two daughters, aged 11 and 13
years, have been in a convent, and Rad
cliffe. It appeared, had b*en contributing
about $Â».". toward their support. Mrs. Rad
cliffe did not seem â  zealous to have
tho custody of the girls, as she claimed
she could not support them, and her at
torney, J. C. Bates, when judge Greene
suggested that he might act as their
guardian, begged to be excused from such
a burden.
It was finally proposed that the mother
superior of the convent be appointed
guardian, provided there be no objections,
and to settle this point the matter went
over for a week. The court Intimated
that Radcliffe will be required to con
tribute $40 monthly for their support.
YOUNG IS NOW AFRAID
OF LADY HOUSEKEEPERS
OAKLAND, Nov. 7.â R. S. Young will
be very careful about engaging another
"young housekeeper who needs a home
for herself and child." His last experi
ence ended with one night in the Oakland
jail, which he declares is punishment
enough, not alone for folly, but almost
for murder. His trial this morning was
very short.
"1 move that the case of Toung be
stricken from the calendar," said the
Prosecuting Attorney.
"It is so ordered," said Judsre Smith,
and Toung was free.
"I am sorry now that I answered that
advertisement," said Young this evening.
"I was tired of hatching, so I rented a
nine-room house in East Oakland and
looked around for a housekeeper. After
a few days pent in negotiating I engaged
herâ with her little boy. We started in
housekeeping-, and every day she had a
:.'â¢.<. romance to tell me of her past con
quests and experiences, and I took it all
in. I agreed to look after her. well and to
pay her $15 per month. At the end of a
month I discharged her, but she would
not go, and she demanded another
month's pay. She remained against my
will and orders till last night, and then
I decided to prevent her using any more
of my stores, so 1 locked her door, lashed
the handle and put a T hinge on the door
and casing. When she discovered what
I had done she yelled out of the window
for the police, and in they came.
"I explained the situation to them, told
them It was my house, and admitted lock-
Ing her door. Everything appeared to be
so straight that the officers were non
plussed, and finally one of them suggested
that I be arrested for disturbing her
peace. This was done, and I was taken
from my own house to Jail, and the
woman whom I had discharged a week
ago and had ordered from my house, was
left where she had no business. I wish
to protest against my treatment In Jail.
I was not permitted to even wash my face
before going to court, and I was sub
jected to Indignities that are a disgrace
to the prison officials and to the city.
"It is very probable that I may sue the
officers and their bondsmen for their
conduct in my house. 1 merely took
measures to prevent Mrs. McCord from
coming out of her room while I was
asleep. This morning there was nobody
on hand to swear to any charge against
me, and I was instantly discharged.
"I shall not engage another young
woman housekeeper in a hurry."

ALAMEDA TRUSTEES
IN STORMY SESSION
WARM DISCUSSION CONCERNING
THE TIDAX CANAL.
Lobbyists Accuss the Board of Not
Acting Honorably in th.Â« Matter
of Wooden Awnings.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 7.â The tidal canal
controversy was resurrected last night at
a meeting of the Board of City Trustees
by a motion from Trustee Mackie that a
committee be appointed to meet a simi
lar commltt>'t; from Oakland to confer
the next step to be taken. A storm
broke almost immediately. Trustee For
derer voiced his surprise that Mackie,
who, he said, had ridiculed a similar plan
somo time ago, should resurrect it now.
Ha naid such a conference was entirely
unnecessary, as the work was all ar
ranged in Alameda's favor and nothing
but an act of Congress could change it.
City Enpinof-r Poyzer addressed tho
board, stating that he agreed with Trus
tee F\>rderer, but- was interrupted by
President Brick.
"You aro out of order, Mr. Poyzer, he
said "When we want information we
will call for it."
"I'm entirely in order," retorted Poyzer;
"I know what I'm talking about and you
do not."
Matters were smoothed over later, when
President Brick admitted he had misun
derstood the City Engineer, to whom he
apologized.
A small sized cyclone started when the
question of removing wooden awnings
was again brought up. A. C. Burns and
B. J- Smith had a wordy war over an
awning on the Burns property, adjoining
Smith's store. The Trustees were about
to rescind an ordinaii'-- adopted at a pre
vious meeting by adopting an amendment
to allow all awnings considered safe to
stand. Smith arose and asked if the
board v*-!s going to perform the great
snake act of Bwallowing Itself. Smith
referred to Burns as "my friend." Burns
denied the allegation and stated that he
lated with gentlemen. More words
followed, and "whisky barrel," "great big
loafer," "bag of wind." "whisky bum"
itber epithets were hurled. Presi
dent Brick and Sergeant of Police Kamp
iinully qut'lled the disturbance. The
board then decided to stand by it? for
mer action and ordered all awnings down,
with tho exception of those in front of
the Park Hotel and Water Works build
ing.
James Munrn accused the board of
showing partiality, and said the reason
the Park Hotel and Water Works build
ing awnings were allowed to stand was
because there was $20,000,000 behind one
and $.'i,(,i>o.'.h'O behind the other. President
Brick remarked that such talk was out
of order. Munro replied that it might be,
but it was the truth nevertheless. Burns
said that thn board was called honora
ble, but it had not acted honorably in
this matter. Brick admitted that the or
dinance was unjust, but voted for it.
Before calling the meeting to order.
President Brick in be-half of a number
of citizens of Alameda presented City
Marshal Conrad with a gold watch and
chain and diamond studded locket.

MAYOR SENDS A
SUGGESTION ON
BOND QUESTION
Board of Works Is
Gathering Data.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Nov. 7.
Mayor Snow has prepared an official
statement regarding the issuance of bonds
for municipal improvements, which he
has submitted to the City Council. The
Mayor's opinion is as follows:
I understand It to be the disposi
tion of your honorable body to afford
the voters of our city, as soon as prac
ticable, an opportunity to vote for
bonds for large and varied public im
provements. You have requested the
Board of Public Works to give you
specific information upon some of
these projects, viz.:
Municipal w;iter supply, salt water
sprinkling plant, dredging slips at city
wharves, constructing intercepting
sewern and a pumping plant, reclaim-
Ing marsh lands, constructing a pier
in the western portion of the city,
erecting school buildings and purchas
ing school sites in the annexed dis
trict, park sites and boulevards, free
library building and site for a new
City Hall.
Concerning all these matters, the
Board of Public Works, through spe
cial committees, are seeking and ob
taining information and will doubtless
report as soon ;is possible. As it will
be necessary for your honorable body
to know beyond a doubt before calling
a bond election whether more than one
proposition can be lawfully submitted
to voters at one time, and under what
special act of the. legislature (there
being several) the different proposi
tions shall be submitted; to avoid de
lay I respectfully surest that while
other details are being determined the
City Attorney be requested to write
a brief upon the whole plan of pro
cedure under the statutes and our city
charter, setting forth the laws so far
as they may be involved in a bond
Issue for the public improvements thus
far suggested, viz. :
Water works (fresh and salt),
wharves, piers, moles and bulkheads;
Intercepting sewers, sewer extensions,
storm sewers, sewage pumping plant,
crematory for garbage, schoolhouse
sites, schoolhouses. acquiring marsh
land and filling same, parks and im
proving same, building boulevards,
paving thoroughfares by the city,
raising Twelfth street dam, free li
brary site and building, City Hall.
Because the method of procedure is
of very great importance, Involving
the validity and sale of the bonds that
may be Issued, 1 further respectfuiiy
recommend that the brief of the City
Attorney be printed and copies be ror
warded to the most prominent firms
of bond buyers and brokers in the
United States, who, I am informed,
will submit such a brief to their at
torneys and report to your honorable
body their concurrence or suggestions.

BABY INTRODUCED AS
"PEOPLE'S EXHIBIT A"
OAKLAND, Nov. 7.â There was a most novel and unprecedented pro
cedure in Judge Hall's court this afternoon during the trial of
Rudolph Permien, charged with betraying Miss Hattle Isaacs, when
a black-eyed little baby was introduced in evidence by the prosecu
tion, and Deputy District Attorney Harris, familiarly known as the
"tall sycamore from Llvermore Valley," politely requested. In tne due
course of legal procedure, that Court Clerk George Pierce label the young
ster 'People's Exhibit A." Attorney Harris did not make any suggestion
as to how the exhibit was to be preserved pending the trial, and the court
clerk was for a few moments puzzled as to whether the duty of caring for
the child devolved upon him, or whether he might be expected to provide a
wetnurse. After the assemblage of degenerates, who' usually throng the
lobby to feast upon the salacious uetails of aueh cases, had its surfeit of
laughter, which only an order from the Court to the bailiff placed a quietus
upon, the little live exhibit was returned to the care of itr mother. The trial
will occupy several days. The prosecution closed its case this afternoon,
but the defense has about sixty witnesses subpenaed.
every dispatch and every picture was
greeted by cheers from some section
or other of the gathering. The crowd
was, no doubt, similar to hundreds of
other crowds gathered for the same
purpose in all parts of the country,
and although the farthest away from
the great centers of politics, the bul
letins were displayed as quickly as in
any State between here and New
York.
The closeness of Oakland to San
Francisco caused great interest in the
contest across the bay, and The Call
posted a continuous stream of bul-
letlns as the count progressed. This
paper was the first to establish a tele
graph office in Its Oakland bureau, and
on every noteworthy occasion since It
has been able to give the news to the
public. So much has this fact become
recognized that the crowd gathers as
a matter of course, whether it be bul
letins of a war, a prizefight or of an
election.

WAS ADAM A NEGRO?
IN the first of a series of articles upon
anthropological data which Professor
Arthur Thompson is writing for
Knowledge he discusses the original
color of mankind and weighs some
evidence bearing upon the question
i whether the earliest races were black or
white.
At the same time he mentions Alfred
Russell Wallace's idea that primitive man
i was a Mongol. This would infer that our
original color was yellow, and when we
consider the civilization of remote times
which existed among the Chinese, that
the people of Europe sprang from Asiatic
stock, and that the identity of the earliest
cave-dwellen in this country and in
France with the Eskimos (also Mongols)
: has been demonstrated, this view does not
seem so very unlikely. Professor Thomp
] son characterizes the theory as suggest
ive, but goes into none of these outside
details, confining himself to a study of
skin, hair and their pigments.
Sorby, he says, isolated three pigments,
using hair as the most convenient subject
for experiment. In light-colored hair a
brown-red and yellow pigment occurs, to
I which in black hair a black coloring mat
ter is added, and it is a remarkable fact
that there may be in a negro's "wool" as
much red pigment as in the European va
riety sometimes .alluded to as "carrots."
Again, when a piece of white skin is
I grafted (as is often done in modern sur
gery; upon a black man, it becomes black,
while black upon a white man loses its
pigment. This, Professor Thompson
I thinks, supports the theory that man has
developed a white skin from a black,
rather than the other alternative.
Other interesting points are brought for
ward. For instance, there is always a
certain amount of pigment in the skin of
even fair people, that is, of the red and
yellow kinds found in the hair, but not
enough to prevent the blood in the vessels
which do not come nearer the surface
than the true skin showing through the
semi-transparent layers of the epidermis.
Bronzing through exposure to the sun is
due to an Increased blood supply and a
corresponding development, freckles and
pigmented spots, similar in structure to
the general skins of darker races, while
dark complexioned people among us have.
In addition to the ordinary pigments, a
trace of the black color of the negro, more
commonly present in our hair. There is
not, however, enough to destroy the radi
â  cal fairness of our skin, though in excep
! tional situations (such as In the arm pits)
its presence may be very evident.
As to the use of a biack skin, Darwin
hinted it might have been developed in
corelatlon with the immunity from mala
rial diseases which darkies enjoy, as it is
true white sufferers acquire a darker
complexion.
In support of the idea that the ancestors
of negroes and white men more nearly re
sembled the latter in color, a point not
mentioned by Professor Thompson might
be brought forward, and that is that pick
aninnies at their birth are not black in
color, but of a dirty gray. If original
man were black, just as the original lion
was spotted, we should expect to find in
the negro infant the black color, as we
find in the young cub the traces of spots.â

Double-Acting Glory.
It is deplorable that we should encoun
ter so much difficulty In subjugating the
fault, as everybody knows, and until they
are sensible enough to see for themselves
that the expansionist can do no wrong
they must continue to be slaughtered.
Everybody who knows anything knows
that war is a glorious thing and that a
war of conquest is the best of all.
As for those American citizens who are
soon to be at the frontâ well, they may
enjoy the change. There are some men
who would rather shoot than work. There
is strong evidence, however, that our sol
diers at the front are disgusted with the

jKIBMISIiJULy'
DEPUTY CITY
CLERK FLETTER
WAITS HIS PAY
Is Granted a Writ of
Mandamus.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 7.
The merry war between Alameda's
Board of City Trustees and City Clerk
Ben F. Lamborn over the appointment of
a deputy clerk and the fixing of his sal
ary will be aired in court.
Last August City Clerk Lambnrn ap
pointed as his deputy Â«'harles F. Fletter,
son of the late City Trustee, F. J. Fletter,
and the latter had supposed that his sal
ary would be no less than $75 per month.
The Trustees, however, have all along
held that Clerk Laraborn's duties are not
so onerous that a deputy should be re
quired and the board has accordingly re
fused to pay Fletter any salary since his
appointment. Repeated requests have
been made that the board lix Fletter's
salary at a reasonable sum, and last night
the affair culminated in the City Trus
tees deciding that the salary be rixed at
$sjper month.
To-day Deputy Clerk Fletter, through
his attorney, Cnarles E. Xaylor, riled a
petition invoking the aid of the Superior
Court and asking that an alternative writ
of mandate isÃue commanding the City
Trustees, Messrs. Brick, Miller, Schulte,
Mackie and Forderer, immediately upon
receipt of such a writ, to fix by ordinance
at a reasonable sum the compensation of
the deputy clerk, the same to date from
August 1; or that they show cause why
they have not done so; and that upon said
hearing the writ be made peremptory.
Later in the day Judge Hall issued the
desired writ and made the same return
able on Monday morning, November 20.
If rumors go for anything the case is to
be bitterly fought. The City Trustees
maintain that they hold a private key to
the controversial situation. Clerk Lam
born, on the uther hand, bases his rights
in the matter upon Rection 78S of an act
of the Legislature for the incorporation
and government of municipal corpora
tions, approved March 13, l*s'S. and upon
the city charter, which authorizes the ap
pointment of a deputy by the Clerks of
cities of the fifth class. Fletter's petition
also cites section 791 of said act and char
ter, which requires the City Trustees to
fix the compensation of all officers of said
city by ordinance.

A HARD FIGHT
OVER PROPOSED
STREET OPENING
Many Owners File a
Strong Protest.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov 7.
Councilman Mott'e scheme for opening
Washington street is to meet with strong
opposition. The matter Is now before rhe
City Attorney, who is preparing the neeps
sary ordinance ordering the preliminary
work done. Mr. Mott had been ;ed to
believe that the opening of the street was
so clearly a necessity that there would be
very little objection to it, while the assess
ment district would be so large that the
cost would fall lightly on the property
owners.
The protest now filed with the City
Council takes the opposite stand in every
particular from that of Mr. Mott. Among
other things the protest, while denying
that there was any necessity for opening
the street at this time, declares that
"property values and the growth of the
city have grown up along the present
lines, and under the present conditions,
and should not be disturbed, nor should
the business center.be disturbed.
I'nrler the present conditions busi
ness is held on Washington street, but
If the street were opened the conditions
would be changed and all property south
of Fourteenth street, not only on Wash
ington, but on Broadway and Clay and
adjoining streets, would be Injured and
depreciated in value.
"There is no congestion of traffic or
Inconvenience to the public that wuM
justify such vast expenditure as would
be required by the proposed work. San
Pablo avenue and Clay street on cither
side answer for all the convenience of
the public.
"And while this proposed work is said
to be principally in the interest and for
the benofit of Washington street, we of
Washington street firmly state and as
sert that it is absolutely opposed to tiifl
best interests of the street, opposed to
its business interest, opposed to its
growth, opposed to its prosperity and is
a positive detriment and no advantage
any way."
The protestants are George Uhl, John
Nicoll Company. Mrs. Joseph Boyd, Ann
M. Snyder, Salinger Bros., Mrs. M X
Blake, F. W. Schultz, Kahn Bros.. Mrs
Anna Relce, E. M. Brown, Abrahamson
Bros., J. T. Moran, Vibella C. Jonks and
Harold L. Martin.

Sold Liquor to Indians.
OAKLAND, Nov. 7.â At the Inquest into
the death of Frank Flores, the Indian
â¢who was stabbed last Sunday at the In
dian Rancherla, near Pleasanton, by

"Where did you get this furniture, old
man?"
"Bought it on the Installment plan."

TROUBLE ON THE
REVENUE CUTTER
RICHARD RUSH
Officer Paul to Be
Court- Martialed.
HE INSULTED HIS SUPERIOR
SPLICED THE MAIN BRACE
ONCE TOO OFTEN."
fcecond Engineer Runs Amuck Aboard
Ship and Attempts to Strike the
Executive Officer, Lieu
tenant Dodge.
Second Engineer G. H. Paul of the rev
enue cutter Rush, who, according to the
statements of thi> crew, has been a dis
turbing element on the ship ever sineo he
â¢ <1 to her, is to ha court-
Tnartialod lor disobeying- orders and at-
: 1' mptlng to assault the executive officer,
F. U. Do^it:.-.
The man, who is now practically in
disgrace among his fellow officers and for
whom the Jolly tars and the marines on
the Rufsh have no kind word, ;* a
Vif being too fond of the oup that cheers,
land the story goes that he "spliced the
main brace once too often." While the
!offlcers of the revenue cutter nre bound
the customs of their position not to
HdiPcuss such matters for publication,
enough has been learned of the trouble
state positively that the situation is a
Bert us one.
On one occasion since the Rush re
ed to port Paul's unquenchable thirst
â ::e<3 control over his better judg
: â¢ and he went on the warpath. His
erent disposition did not break out
until ho returned to the ship one night
she was lying- In thr- stream. After
rbing most or" the crew, it is stated,
lie ran into the executive officer, for
vliom the sailors say he had no great
int of affection. Hn was on
to his quarters, but refused to obey the
command. He in said to have lost com
plete ' himself and to have made
a.n attempt to striki> his superior. Several
members of the crew, who were near by,
grabbed him before he could carry his
threat i ution.
. The result of the affair is that charges
against Paul were compiled and forward
ed to Washington October 24. They were
jnade by the executive officer, Lieutenant
.Dodge. The following' board has been
appointed to try the offending officer:
Captain C. L. Hooper, president; Captain
TV. C. Caulson, Chief Engineers J. A.
Doyle and J. H. Cbalker, and Second
Lieutenant B. M. Landrey of the revenue
service. Second Lieutenant C. S. Coch
ran was named as recorder of the board
and First Lieutenant D, J. Foley has been
6elected to prosecute the offender.
The court-martial will be held on board
of the Rush as soon as Captain Hooper,
â who is stationed at Seattle, selects the
day and can arrange to come here.
Lieutenant Dodge when seen last even-
Ing on the Rush refused to enter into a
detailed discussion of the trouble. He
eaid that the charges had been nied but
would not state the nature of them.
From members of the crew, however,
It is learned that Paul has not been a
popular man aboard ship. He has been
domineering over the members of the
crew whoso stations were beneath his,
and to the officers and his superiors ne
has been a source of continual trouble.
No sympathy is expressed for him in his
present difficulty, and the crew state that
If he had received his Just deserts he
â¢would have been court-martialed long ago.
Captain Hooper was In Oakland Mon
day on his way to Seattle. "When Been by
a. representative of The Call he denied
by Inference that there was any trouble
on the Rush, that any of the officers had
been court-martialed or that he had been
â¢appointed president of the board that
â would try the charges.

"prosperous this year, both from an artistic
asuid financial stand;-iint. Follow
ing th^ tremendous buc<;c-.=s of the Mlnettl
Quartet comes the Holmes Quartet, and
proves by its careful work that It Ir en
titled to a prominent position In musical
'Circles. Henry Holmes is one of those
reverend musicians whose respect for ihcÂ»
old masters 1b ho profound that they look
rather askance at thÂ»> modern lions of
composition. This revorence does not,
however, interfere with the fine tai-re and
delicacy of execution which generally ac
companies th* recital of such adherents
-to the old school , nnd It was thi
not surprising to ;'. 'I last <â  enlng

The programme consisted of quartet in
A. No. 3. ..p. 41 (Schumann), fragments
of a string quart el (Mendelssohn) and
string quartet in C, No. 3, op. :::: (Haydn).
Th<- Schumann quartet, with its expres
novementÃ, was perhaps the best
from an artistic standpoint. Its t â 
-;s of that sublimity which sur
rounds .-ill compositions that express
genuine emotion. These very emotional
teristics, which Schumann knows
bo well how to obtain, make th,-. ,;.
Impression upon the careful listener and
the quartet arrives at the ;â¢.â 
that movement in which emotion broadens
out as if to seek th< i being im
prisoned in narrow walls, requires the
greatest accomplishment " f 'he musician.
while Mr. Holmes' Interpretation showed
an Intimate acquaintance with this class
of work, the quartet >i:il nut nave suf
ficient experience to play with tnat
mellowness of tone which form the main
requisites of an adagio movement. A.i I
I might even restrict this somewhat
harsh intonation to the violins, for the
â¢cello and viol.i px\r> quite a smooth tone.
The best work of the quartet was the
Mendelssohn "Fragment ," ;. : .,i especially
so the scherzo movement. This was exe
cuted with a daintiness of expression de
lightful to behold. The Haydn qu
too. received a creditable interpretation.
Th<"- first concert of the quartet entitles
it to further encouragement, and ;he
audience present accorded it a hearty
ovation.
The vocalist of the evening was Mrs.
Charles Ol'*ott Richards. I do not know
whether Mrs. Richards la a profe-
Binger. but her appearance in a chamber
r.cert subjects her to -
criticism. Her voice Is flexible and clear,
but it is morf owing to the excellent man
ner of her execution than to the quality
of her voice. In fact, Mrs. Richards'
voice nppears to be built, and WB
did this building knew his business thor
oughly. Mrs. Richards would find it a
freat ' improvement if she would use a
etter diction. For instance, If she would
let her lips get into a natural position In-
BtMd of stretching them across hor
teeth: a distinct pronunciation w>uld cer
tainly be tl â¢ lcsult of such improvement.

Convention, which assembled yesterday
afternoon in Golden Gate Hall, the day j

ALEXANDER D. KEYES
BECOMES A BENEDICT
ATTORNEY WEDS KATE THORN
TON SALISBURY.
The Nuptials Are Celebrated Very
Quietly at the Home of the Bride
on California Street.
A very pretty wedding took place yes
terday afternoon at the residence of Mrs.
Monroe Salisbury, 1414 California street,
when Miss Kate Salisbury and Alexander
Keyes were united in marriage in tha j
presence of about one hundred and fifty |
guests.
Mrs. Salisbury, the mother of the bride,
received the guests in a very handsome
claret colored gown of heavy silk, made
en train and embellished with wine col- !
ored tulle.
Promptly at 4;30 o'clock, to the music j
of "Lohengrin," sung by the Berkeley
Glee Club, the wedding party entered the
room. First came the bridesmaids, Miss
Azalea Keys, niece of the groom;
Prances Baldwin, Miss Olive Holbrook I
and Miss Josephine Longborough. After
th.m came the bride, leaning on the arm .
â â â  uncle. Neal Robinson, and follow
ing them was the maid of honor, Mis?
Margaret Salisbury, sister of the bride.
Winneld Scott Keyes was the best man.
The costumes worn by the bride and her
attendants were artistic and very ele- j
gant. The bridesmaids, two of them, :
wore gowns of pink crepe de chine over ]
pink taffeta, and carried immense bou
quets of white roses. The other two were I
(3 in white crepe de chine over white
a and carried pink roses. The maid
of honor was arrayed in an exquisite con- j
feet ion of tine white Swiss, covered with i
Intlnlteslmally small tucks. Her bouquet
was lilies of the valley, and a spray of
these delicate flowers decorated her hair. I
fcfiss Salisbury's gown was of white
satin. It was made with a full, long train,
and the corsage was finished with a trim
ming of superb lace. The bride wore a i
long tulle wedding veil, and a bouquet of
lilies of the valley completed a very ex- '
quisite costume.
The room in which the ceremony was ;
rmed was a perfect bower of roses
i and chrysanthemums. During the cere- I
mony. which was performed by Rev.
Father Prendergast, the couple stood un- !
der a canopy of pink roses, with huge [
shaggy headed white chrysanthemums
banked at fither side.
Aft'-r an Informal reception the wed- '
ding supper was served. Tho bride's table
wap prettily decorated in pink. Duchess
roses were banked on the table, and tho
candelabra were bright with pink shadi s
At the bride's table were the maid of
honor, the bridesmaids and the members i
of the Rerkeley Glee Club, who sang sev
eral selections while the sapper was being
served. The bride has been a very promi
nent member of society, and the groom
the son of the late General Keyes, is well
known.

Desertion the Principal Offense of tho

vestigations as to
Fitness.
The other half of the Forty-second Reg
iment arrived yest< rday and joined the
companies already at the Presidio. The
second half was the one delayed by the
accident, and besides the story of the ac
cident It brought in n story of a derailed
train, twenty men slightly injured and
one man suffering from concussion of the
brain. The man suffering from concus
sion of the brain was left behind in the
hospital.
The second section of the Forty-jvpcond
came in under command of Lieutenant
Colonel Beacom, who, until the regiment
reaches Manila, will be Benior officer of
the regiment. Colonel J. Milton Thomp
son Is colonel of the regiment, but he is
already In Manila, and not until his
twelve companies arrive there will he
come to the duties of the spread eagle.
Lieutenant Colonel Beacom reports a
quiet trip out from Fort Niagara. He
pride in the fact that there was
not one man missing, not a man under
arrest, nor a man chargeable with nny
minor infraction of the military laws. He
brings forty-five officers and over 1200
men. all well drilled, but a little lacking
in target practice. It was the lack of
target practice which kept back the regl
mentfi already here, and it la plain that
the Forty-second will have to spend a
good deal of the time left it before de
parture for Manila on the ranges at the
Presidio. One thing the Department of
California demands from the men who go
from it Is accuracy of fire, and whenever
n regiment lacking in target practice ar
rives it must put in at least a certain
amount of practice at the ranges before
it is even spoken of for a transport.
There is more trouble about incompe
tent or apparently incompetent officers
among the regiments arriving from the
Bast. The latest orders have another
batch of officers to appear before the
nvntal examining board and a second lot
lo appear before the medical hoard. The
board, by orders, is {.he same as before â
Colonel Freeman, Colonel Rawles and
Captain Prattâ and it is supposed to in
quire Into th" fitness in every way of the
officer ordered before it. The latest or
ders to appear before the board include
Captain Paul B. Lino, Captain "William

NANCE O'NEIL
WANTED BLOOD
There was a difference of opinion behind
the Bcenes at the California Theater the
other night. It happened between the acts
of "Oliver Twist."
Mlps O'Nei] left the Btar dressing room
and started for the wings in response to
a "hurry up" from Mr. Gleason. The
spirit of Nancy Sykes had descended upon
her, and she swashed her brown calico
and rolled, hands on hips, according to
the slums of London town. She stopped
on her way to give an order to a maid,
and it was at this point that Mr. Duval, a
person of some authority, stopped her.
"You are not going to put blood on^ your
face to-night, are you, Miss O'Nell?"
Nance stopped and turned toward him
by means of her neck alone. Her eye
brows were up.
"You are joking. Mr. Duval," in mutter
ing thunder. ,
"No. I'm not. Don't put it on your face.
Be murdered without the blood. Come,
d Â° f And O why, may I ask?" Nance Sykes
was translating hersell Into Magda.
â¢â¢It'll spoil your complexion.
Then the storm burst. The eyebrows
came down, but the chin went up, and
Mi?s O'Nell'B large arm gesticulated side
ward as it is wont. In the most booming
kind or thunder she broke loose.
"Mr Duval. you must be insane. Not
put blood on my face! Spoil the per
formance? Do you suppose 1 care for my
complexion? I? Do you? Mr. Duval, un
derstand that I will give an artistic per
j formance if it costs me my complexion
forever."
Mr Duval became so small that he was
â  neither heard nor seen. Nancy Sykes
swept magnificently past trunks and fur
niture and scenes and entered fiercely at
her cue. . .
That is why she was so drenehingly
gory in the last act that Mr. Oppenheimer
said things under his breath about spoil
ing his new stage with red paint, and two
members of the audience were carried out
In hysterics. And that Is why Mr. Duval
is recalling all the pro erbs he ever heard
about perversity and women.

Adopted To-Day.
The transport St. Paul arrived from
Manila yesterday afternoon, after a good
passage of twenty-seven days. She would
have been here Monday night had it not
been for a slight break in the machinery
which prevented the engines being run at
full speed. Captain Hays reports leaving
Manila on October 11 and making the run
to Nagasaki in five days. The Indiana,
with the Tennessee troops aboard, left
Nagasaki a few hours ahead of the St.
Paul, bounu for Yokohama. The St. Paul
overhauled and passed the Indiana the
same day, and the officers of the trans
port think it will be next Friday before
the Tennessee boys reach here.
The passengers on the St. Paul were:
Mrs. C. H. Andrews and Myron Andrews,
the wife and son of Lieutenant Andrews
of the medical department of the army;
R. S. Chamberlin, a mining expert; James
Gillies, ex-quartermaster sergeant of
Company C, First California; Joseph M.
Ross, ex-sergeant Company C, First Cali
fornia; O. C. Heise, assistant surgeon,
Twelfth Infantry; Joseph A. McGeary,
Fourteenth Infantry; George H. Grilling,
paymaster, U. S. N.; Matthew Burke, Ed
Arnold and F. L. Lowell of the quarter
master's department. Mr. McGeary was
formerly in the office of the postofflce in
spectors, but when the call to arms came
he resigned his position and enlisted in
the Fourteenth Infantry, He was a very
sick man before leaving Manila, but is
now well on the road to recovery.
The St. Paul came into port in splendid
order. She does not look like a troop
ship and everybody aboard has a good
word to say lor Captain Hays and his
officers. The ship carried the Third Cav
alry from Seattle to Manila and Captain
Hays brings back a very handsome re
minder of the trip. It is a decanter of cut
glass, beautifully chased with silver and
bearing the following inscription: "To
Captain G. M. Hays, S. S. St. Paul, from
the officers of the Third Cavalry and med
ical staff, October, 1899."
Purser E. L. Gould, as usual, had every
thing in readiness for the quarantine offi
cer, customs inspectors and, last but not
least, the newspaper men, so no one was
delayed. He reports that the Indiana,
besides the Tennessee Regiment, had 100
prisoners aboard when she was at Naga
saki. They were all in charge of Lieu
tenant Desmukes and have from three to
ten years' sentences to serve. At Naga
saki one eight-year, one five-year and one
three-year prisoner escaped and were not
recaptured. As soon as the Indiana ar
rived the quartermaster's steamer Mc-
Dowell will take the prisoners aboard and
land them on Alcatraz. - *
Mr Goold says that the day after the
St. Paul left MajUla they passed a derelict
barge No. 1779. Early in October the
steamers Esmeralda and Lagaspi left
Hongkong for Manila with launches and
barges in tow for the United States Gov
ernment. They were caught in the
typhoon of October 1-3 and the Lagaspl
lost her tow. The barge passed by the
St. Paul Is supposed to have belonged to
her.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia arrived from Honolulu yesterday,
after a splendid passage of six days eight
hours. The run would have been made in
less than six days had it not been for the
heavy fog which caused Captain Houd
lette to slow his vessel down when he
was approaching the coast. The Austra
lia brought up 63 cabin and 35 steerage
passengers. Those in the cabin were:
S. B. Rose, wife and son; Miss E. E.
Chaffee, O. Eastwood and wife, Miss E.
Q. O'Connell. Miss L. C. O'Connell, Mrs.

ers came back. Their season in Honolulu
was not a success, strange to say. Cap- i
tain Peterson and wife also came up on
the Mall boat. Captain Peterson was
master of the bark Lady Lamnson when
she was lost on Palmyra Island. He and
Mrs. Peterson and live of the crew were
for twenty-eight days in an open boat and
finally reached the coast of Hawaii.

MURDERER DE BAUGE
SHEDS BITTER TEARS
MAKES STATEMENT DETAILING
THE DEATH STRUGGLE.
His Defense Will Probably Be That
He Was Temporarily Insane
When He Committed
the Deed.
Paul de Bauge, the cook who murdered
Delia Tracey, alias Reynolds, alias O'Con
nor, in her room at 14 Turk street early
yesterday morning, was taken before
Judge Mogan yesterday and instructed as
to his rights. He asked for time to com
municate with his friends, and the Judge
continued the case till to-morrow.
De Bauge is suffering from the effects
of his struggle with the woman and yes
l terday morning was tanon to the Re
ceiving Hospital for treatment. He had
an incised wound on the little finger of
bis right hand and was otherwise in
jured, besid' s liciiiL; scratched repeatedly
on the faro and forehead, showing that
the woman had made a desperate strug
gle for her life. He had to be taken back
again to the hospital yesterday after
noon.
De Bauge made a full statement yester
day to Captain Bohen, and during its
recital he was in tears. He said he was
born in Meiiux, France, forty-seven years
ago and came to this city when 18 years
of age. He had worked as a conk in
nearly all the leading restaurants. He
was married in 1884 and lived with his
wife at 1010 Mission street. In March,
LB9B, he went to the Klondike with his
adopted son Charlie and returned about
four weeks ago.
He had been drinking before he met the
woman. He detailed in full the quarrel
with her over the missing $10 gold piece
and the death struggle. He claims thai
she took the dirk out of his pocket and
attempted to use it on him and he suc
ceeded in wrenching it from her, the han
dle remaining in her hand. He became
crazy and used the dirk on her neck.
When the policeman arrived he strug
gled with them and got a black eye.
De Bauge's wife called at the prison
yesterday morning and there was an ef
fecting Bcene between them. They em
braced each other and both shed tears.
After she left him she was utterly pros
trated. Mrs. de Bauge is a handsome,
ladylike woman.
The autopsy on the woman's body
showed that there were twenty-eight
wounds in her neck, which caused" death
besides others on her forehead and head.
The inquest will be held to-morrow.
