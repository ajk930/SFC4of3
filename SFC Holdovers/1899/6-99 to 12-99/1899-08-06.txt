WAGING A WAR
OF EXTERMINATION

Forces of General Torres Are
Promptly Shot.

Americans Their Victims.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. s.â When the
Yaqui Indians signed a treaty of
peace with the Mexican Govern
ment a little over two years ago.
and their country, which has been
a terra incognita to all but members of
their own tribes for over two centuries,
was thrown open to settlement, hun
dreds of adventuresome men went from
this part of Texas to prospect for gold
along the Yaqui River. It will be re
membered that immediately following
the signing of the treaty of peace by
the Yaquis reports were freely circu
lated that gold placers in fabulous rich
ness existed in the heretofore unknown
region. These glowing reports stimu
lated the rush of prospectors.
Among those from this * section who
sought their fortunes in the remote re
gions was Thomas Grevolt, formerly a
prominent stockman of Llano County.
He has just arrived at the town of Ter
razas. in the State of Chihuahua, after
an exciting experience with the Yaqui
Indians. In a letter to D. T. Rainey
of this city, received to-day, Mr. Gre
volt says:
"I have Providence to thank that I
have again reached the outskirts of civ
ilization and am able to write you these
few lines. The Yaquis are on the great
est rampage in their history, and un
less speedy relief comes the hundreds
of unsuspecting American miners in
the Yaqui country will all be massacred
and robbed of what gold they have ac
cumulated. It was only by mere luck
that I got out in time. John Herkner,
one of my partners, who used to live
at San Antonio, Tex., was on his way
to San Javier after supplies, when I
got word of the outbreak from a friend
ly Tomachic Indian. I have no doubt
that Herkner was killed. There were
several Americans below me to the
south of Soyopa, and unless they were
â¢warned in time many of these prospect
ors were killed. This Tomachic Indian
told me that the Y'aquis had planned to
sweep the whole valley and kill and rob
every American and Mexican in their
path. He said that the ranches of Jose
Merea and Andreas Longera, near
Cocori, had just been attacked by the
Yaquis. Merea and five cowboys were
killed in defending their home, and his
wife and two children were massacred.
Longera managed to get his wife and
children into the mountains when he
saw the Indians coming, but several of
his cowboys, who resisted the attack,
were killed.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELL
INGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON.
Aug. 5.-â Official advices received at
the State Department from Minis
ter Powell refer to the large num
ber of arrests being made by the
Haytian officials, and the very fev
erish condition of affairs. Although
the dispatch does not so state, the
authorities assume from the tone
of Mr. Powell's advices that there is
an extensive plot on foot to overthrow
the Government, and that the men ar
rested are suspected of being revolu
tionists.
It is also understood that threats
have been made against the American
legation at Port au Prince on account
of a refugee who sought %an asylum
'with Minister Powell.
The situation is such that an Ameri
can man-of-war, in all probability, will
be sent to Port au Prince within the
next twenty-four hours to protect
American interests, landing marines
if threats against the legation should
be put into execution. The New Or
leans and Machias, now at San Do
mingo, are within a day's call of Port
au Prince.

Holland be' asked to send representatives to take part in the investi- ,
gation. -'>.;.â  . .'â -'â >-
According to the same disjatch an unconfirmed report is in cir-
culation that General Joubcrc lies resigned command of the army of

"The Indians burned all the buildings
on those two ranches and drove off
over 1000 head of cattle. It is going to'
take the Mexican Government a long
time and a big force of troops to quell
this rebellion. The Yaquis are better j
prepared now than ever before for a
long and bloody campaign. They are {
well fixed financially, nearly all of them j
having saved $200 per head which the I
Mexican Government paid them when j
they signed the treaty two years ago.
They have been making money since j
then, too, and I know- it to be a fact j
that they have been laying in big sup
plies of arms and ammunition for some j
time past. It has been common talk !
among the American prospectors in the !
Yaqui Valley that the Indians were
preparing for another outbreak, but as I
the braves had always shown a friendly
spirit toward us Americans, we thought
they would not molest us when they did
go on the warpath. They are deter
mined to recover all of their lost coun
try, however, and will kill all within
the limits of their old possessions. I
had a rough trip over the mountains
from ray camp in the Soyopa district,
but am glad to get out alive."
It is reported from Potam, State of
Sonora, Mexico, that General Lorenzo !
Torres at the head of his troops fought
a pitched battle with the rebels at j
Vicam, defeating them and inflicting
heavy losses and recovering possession
of the town.
The Federal troops reached Vicuna

rain storm, which ceased about sun- !
down. Taking advantage of the favor

Torres ordered a general advance upon
the position occupied by the rebels. The
troops met with stubborn resistance,
the Indians rallying at the call of their .
chiefs and fighting with desperate cour
age. They finally broke and fled, leav
ing several prisoners in the hands of
the Government forces, the ensuing i
darkness preventing pursuit.
On the following morning the prison
ers taken during the battle of the pre
vious evening wore summarily shot by
order of General Torres, the general
adhering to his avowal made at the
conclusion of the last war with the
Yaquis that if they ever dared to rebel
against the Federal Government the
entire race would be exterminated.
A cordon of troops has been estab
lished on the plan of the famous trocha
of Cuba, reaching from Potam to Torin,
to prevent the rebels from retreating to
the mountains.
Colonel Angel Garcia. Peria has been
ordered to advance with his forces from
Torin to prevent . any reinforcements
from reaching the Yaquis.

cers, Mr. Powell cabled the department
to-day that his demand for the release
of the prisoner had been complied with
and that he was again enjoying an

was taken by Mr. Powell upon instruc

DRAMA ARRIVE AT RENNES
Parade of Troops Past the House Where Mme. Dreyfus Is Stopping
at Rennes.
RENNES, France, Aug. s.â Rennes '
has awakened from its normal
condition of sleepiness and with '
the arrival of hundreds of jour
nalists from all parts of the world and j
witnesses and other actors in the Drey- â 
fus drama, the town is assuming an j
animated appearance. The terraces in,
front of the cafes are full of people.dis
cussing the coming trial, which will
open on Monday morning at half-past 6
or 7 o'clock. . 'r.t. *
General Mercier, who was Minister |
for War. when' Dreyfus was condemned,
arrived from Paris this j afternoon, and I
his face showed an anxious, careworn
look. A large number of persons had
gathered on the platform at the railway
station to witness his arrival, but no
noteworthy event occurred.
The leading event of the day was the
arrival of the hero of the Dreyfus af- !
fair, Lieutenant Colonel Georges Pic- j
quart. His train arrived at 7 o'clock ;
this evening, an hour late, and only a
! few people were present at the station ;
except detectives and police officers. j
As Colonel Picquart entered the car
; riage which Maitre Laborie, counsel for
Dreyfus, had waiting for him in the!
station yard, some of the spectators
shouted: "Vive Picquart" and "Vive
Dreyfus." These shouts elicited counter i
' cries of "A bas Picquart." and "A mort, |
a l'eau" from a few anti-Dreyfusites j
present.
But the bark of the latter, was worse
than their bite, for not the slightest at- ;
tempt was made to carry out their
threats, and Colonel Picquart utterly
ignored, them. He did. not give even a ,
glance to the shouters as his carriage |

NEW YORK. Aug. 5.â A Sun

The secretary of . the Embassy
added to his denial the remark:

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. -Most of
the newspapers here cordially welcome
M. Del Casse, the French Minister of
Foreign Affairs, who arrived here yes-,
terday. The Novoe Vremya. however,
throws cold douches on the importance
the French, papers seek to - attribute to
the visit. It says that while, since the
advent of the Waldeck-Rousseau Min

dering explanations desirable, the sig
nificance of the visit is wholly of a
one-sided character, and, to Russia,
it would have made "no serious differ

turn visit and remained at his post,
where he might be better employed in
explaining to 'hif. colleagues the con
duct which the Franco- r.u.ssiar. alli

The authorities are, apparently be

the town by a crowd of anti-Drey
fusites, and heroic police measures were
taken this evening to insure. peace dur

which were quite private. .-.A small
number of people assembled in the

Cards of admission to the trial were

WORK OF SAMOAN
COMMISSION MEETS
CHIEFS' APPROVAL
Representatives of the Three
Powers Confer With Native
Leaders at Mulinuu.
United States Government Expected to Pay
Natives for Arms Now Being Taken
to Mare Island in the Badger.
From a Special Correspondent of The Call.
HONOLULU, H. 1., July 29.â The
United States steamer Badger,
bearing two of the three Samo
an Commissioners, arrived at
this port Wednesday afternoon,
July 26, eight days from Apia, on her
way to San Francisco. On board were
Hon. Bartlett. Tripp. United States
Commissioner, and Baron yon Stern
berg, representative of Germany. Mr.
C. N. E. Eliot, Commissioner for Great
Britain, sailed by way of New Zealand
and Australia for London to report di
rectly to his Government, v.;
The Commissioners are well satisfied
with their work at Samoa and are in
hopes that the amendments they have
proposed to the Berlin treaty will se
cure to Samoa both good government
and perpetual peace.
On the evening of July 14 there as
sembled at Mulinuu, the ancient seat
of the Samoan Government, 413 chiefs
and high chiefs cf Samoa (250 of the
Mataafa faction and 163 of the Malie
toa party), when the changes in the
proposed amendments to the original
Berlin treaty were laid before them by
the Joint High Commission and by
them unanimously adopted, and thir
teen high chiefs from each party were
selected to ratify 9id adopt such
amendments by affixi..g their names to
the official document.
It was a remarkable spectacle. Seat
ed on the green sward under the wav
ing cocoa palms of Mulinuu, several
hundred savages lovingly embraced
and rubbed noses, who a month ago
were eager for each other's head.
The Commissioners were under escort
of a guard of honor from each of the
warships of the three powers in the
harbor; neither Mataafa nor Malietoa
we. re-Present, the former being ill with
a fever and the latter did not care to
appear unless his rival was on hand,
but both were well represented by their
high chiefs. .Never since, the days of
Queen Salamasene, the first .Queen of
the' Samoan- Islands, has there been
assembled such a vast display. of na
tive nobility. <
If the Samoans are left to themselves
it is thought these relations will last,
for it is believed the natives were
sincere in their expressions when they
said they "knew that the commission
had come to Samoa for the good of
Samoa." But this would be in direct
opposition to the sentiments of the
white people on the beach, who, for
pecuniary purposes, desire to compel
the three powers to keep their war
ships in the harbor all the year round.
This means to them many dollars in
good money. Since January, 1899, the
cash estimated to have been paid to the
crews of the various ships in port is
$30,000. The best part of this money
has been spent in Apia. One store
keeper told me that it was worth to
him each month just $1500 for each
vessel in the harbor. The natives also
reap a harvest from the ships by sell
ing curios and. fruit, this being their
only means of making money, and they
of course are desirous of seeing the
ships remain in port. One of the prin
cipal traders on the beach has seven
different stores on the islands, and
since January has twice sold out the
entire stock of each store, and was*
complaining that he could not receive
his goods from San Francisco fast

enough to stock up again. Had it not
been for the war his stock of goods
would still be on the shelves.
This, of course, is merely one side ot
the question. There are many other
traders who have lost money and prop
erty and who will be glad that peace la
at least temporarily established. The
report that Malietoa Tanu was to bÂ»
banished to the Fiji Islands is entirely
without foundation.
The proposed amendments to the
Berlin treaty consist briefly as follows:
The kingship is forever abolished on
the islands of Samoa. In place of a
King there will be an Administrator,
possibly some man from the Dutch
West Indies, as by long years of ex
perience the Dutch thoroughly under
stand the management of colonies. The
islands will be divided into districts,
each district to be ruled by a Governor,
who will be a native chief. The munic
ipal district of Apia will be governed
by a Mayor, and there will also be a
Municipal Magistrate. Although the
Chief Justice of Samoa has retired,
having left on the last mail steamer
for San Francisco, there will be an
other man appointed in his place. The
native judges will be allowed to try
all cases of crimes and offenses com
mitted by natives only, according to
the laws and customs of Samoa. So,
practically speaking, the Samoans will
govern themselves, although every
thing will be subject to the approval of
the Administrator, who will be the
"Big Chief Man."
The abolishment of the kingship. It
was expected, would be a bitter pill to
both Mataafa and Malietoa as well as
to the chiefs and high chiefs, but on
the contrary they seem to all outward
appearances to be perfectly satisfied
with the decision of the Commissioners.
- The Badger has on board about 3500
rifles which were surrendered by the
natives on each side. These arms will
be turned in at the navy yard at Mare
Island. An appraisal of their value
was made by representatives of - the
three powers and the natives will prob
ably be reimbursed.
The importation of arms, other than
those used for sporting purposes, is
prohibited. Violation of this ; law is
made punishable by a fine of $2500.
The claims filed with the Commis
sioners by the residents of Samoa
amount to about $440,000. Of this
amount $25,000 is asked by the native
population. The principal claims for
indemnity are those of the French
Catholic Mission, which asks $22,000,
and the German firm which claims
$1900. These two claims are largely the
result of looting done by the native
soldiers at Mulinuu while under the In
structions of the English officers. Dur
ing the war and during the armistice
the natives were penned in at Mulinuu
and were short of rations. The English
officers ordered them into the bush on
weekly foraging expeditions, and they
looted the first available place, which
was the property of the French Mission
and the German firm. â¢
The commission has received no in
structions in regard to these claims and
have arrived at no decision as to what
will be done with them. While they
have filed the claims, they have in na
way committed either themselves or
the powers as to the manner in which
they will finally be treated.

OIL DERRICKS TO
MAR THE REACH
Santa Barbarenos Pro
test In Vain.
Special Disrate- to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. There
Was filed in the Recorder's office yes
terday a lease from Susan E. Eells to
H. L. Nelson of the Salt Pond tract
east of Santa Barbara, and commonly
known as the Bradley Racetrack. The
lease calls for 67.75 acres of land, in
cluding a strip of sand land of no ap
parent value, connecting about seven
acres between the beautiful Ocean
boulevard and high water mark. An
option to purchase the tract at the ex
piration of one year for $5000 was ob
tained by Nelson.
Nelson is the man whose oil derrick,
erected on the beach of Miramar, was
destroyed by the Fernald party last
Wednesday night. The objection was
that, if these derricks were allowed to
be put up along the water front, the
entire beach of Santa Barbara, Monte
clto and Miramar would be ruined and
the beautiful residences and resident
property along the beach would greatly
decrease in value. The citizens have
determined derricks shall not be erect
ed, even if mob violence is necessary.
While the citizens have been entering
their objections, Nelson has been quiet
ly obtaining leases of. land along the
entire beach from the east' side of the
city limits to Summerland. The sixty
seven acres- included in the Bradley
tract is but a small part of the leases or
options obtained. Several others have
been filed. Late this evening there was
tiled a lease to three-quarters of an
acre adjoining Miramar, and a beach
claim was located directly in front of
this portion of an acre, in the name of
H. L. Nelson.
J. C. French, the other owner of the j
derrick destroyed on Wednesday night, i
located a beach claim directly in front :
of the magnificent new home of Major
J. E. Beale this afternoon. This claim
adjoins the ocean boulevard and is j
near the Bradley tract. French and
Nelson are working together. They
gave it out positively to-day that they \
would bore for oil not only at this
point but all along the beach, upon j
lands leased by them, and they claim to j
have "a pocketful of options, taking up !
all the oil lands between Santa Bar- [
bara and Summerland."
Nelson left this afternoon for San
Francisco, remarking that if the people
of Santa Barbara were determined to
use mob violence against any one erect
ing oil derricks between high and low
water marks, he had obtained enough
lands to erect them every few rods
along the beach, and not below high
water mark.
Four Locations were made to-day, of
claims along the beach to the west of
the Santa Barbara city limits and very
close to town, and -a company has been
formed to prospect for oil at this place.
It is claimed that San Francisco capi
tal is behind Nelson. It is feared that
in a very' short time oil derricks will be
put up on both sides of the city's beau
tiful ocean driveway.

between France and Germany were need
ed it would be seen in the enthusiasm

who Is at the head of the undertaking,
writes that she is overwhelmed with let
ters, both from Germany and France.

STRIKE OF PRINTERS
ON NEW YORK SUN
Result of Rumors That Non-Union
Men Were to Replace the Me
chanical Force.
NEW YORK. Aug. s.â Representatives
of Typographical Union No. 6 waited upon
Assistant Business Manager Paddock of
the New York Sun to-night to ask him if
he would abide by the rules and regula
tions of the Typographical Union as at
present in vogue. This action was the
result, it was said at the headquarters of
the typographical union, of rumors which
reached the members on Friday that
Charles W. Edwards, 1 who is said to be
In charge of the mechanical arrangements
of the Sun office, was about to replace
the union compositors and stereotype!
with non-union men. About the time this
conference was going on 135 compositors,
eight boys and ten stereotypers stopped
â work but remained about the premises. ,
They were orderly and made no demon
stration. Notwithstanding this, the police
of the Oak-street station were notified and
a number of policemen were sent to guard
the Sun office.
President AVarrell of the committee was
spokesman for Typographical Union No. 6.
Mr. Paddock, it is claimed, declined to
commit himself In any manner. He said
he had no power to act, and that it would
be necessary, for the men to see some one
higher in authority. This the men claimed
they could not do to-night, and accord
ingly left the building.
At the headquarters of Typographical
Union No. 6 it was said a force of non
union men was on Its way here from Phil
adelphia in a boat, and that the men
would probably arrive here on Sunday
morning. All information concerning the
matter was refused at the editorial rooms
and business office of the Sun to-night.

C. E. Xl ink's Demonstration That the
Company Is Poverty Stricken
to a Distressing De
gree.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. s.â The State
Board of Equalization to-night con
tinued its inquiry into the affairs of the
Southern Pacific Company to determine
the amount Of taxes the corporation
should pay to the State. Yesterday
the hearing was begun, and several
hours were consumed in listening to the
statements of E. Black Ryan, the rail
road's tax agent, the general tenor of
which was that his company was in a
most o^stressingly impoverished con
dition. Equalizer Toland put some
questions to Ryan which the latter
could not, or would not, answer, and it
was decided to postpone the hearing
until to-night, and to obtain the at
tendance of C. T. Klink, the chief clerk
in the office of the controller of the
Southern Pacific Company.
Equalizer Toland led out by asking
Klink to state the capital stock, the
bonded debt and the value of the bonds
and stocks, together with the dividends
declared by each of the roads of the
Southern Pacific system. Klink
claimed to be in Ignorance of the value
of the stocks or bonds of any of the
roads. He asserted that none of the
roads of the Southern Pacific system
declared any dividends during the
years 1897, 1898 and 1899.
Klink then proceeded to read a lot
of figures, giving the amount of out
standing bonds against the various
branches. This recital was made up of
a perplexing mass of figures calculated
to drive anybody not a mathematician
to the point of despair, and the mem
bers were obliged to swallow it all
with abject resignation.
The hearing was continued until
Monday morning next.
WHITMAN AND WARE
PLAY GREAT TENNIS !
Champion Forced to Work Hard in
His Game With the
Canadian.
SOUTHAMPTON, L. 1., Aug. s.âMal
colm Whitman, the national champion, |
was put to the test here this morning i
to defeat the ex-champion of Canada.
Lee Ware, in the final and champion
ship rounds of the Long Island tennis
championship tournament, . Ware
started right in at the beginning of the
match to make Whitman win every
point by the best that was in him. The
pace was fast and furious and the
champion was soon panting with
fatigue as his opponent kept the ball
"cross-courting" most of the time.
Early in the match Ware played to
force the champion's back hand, but
found it invincible. But on the -play
at the barrier he was able to score
against Whitman by clever passing and :
placing. Ware also lobbed effectively I
against the champion, who made his j
only faults in trying to check this at
tack of his opponent. On the other j
hand, the former champion was mac- j
curate in his stroke, and in consequence j
many of the balls landed in the net j
when he returned. "i.V"
The downfall of W. A. Lamed and
D wight Davis and Whitman's victory
over the superb play of Ware In this
tournament are regarded as equivalent
to an assured victory for Whitman at
Newport.
This afternoon Whitman and Ware
defeated Allen, the Yale champion, who
was paired with the Harvard player,
McKittrick, in a five set match, in the
final round of the doubles. . The college
pair led up to 4â3 and 40â15 in the third
set. Then the resourceful play of
W hitman was put to the touch, and by
the most clever' sort of work he pulled
out the remaining three straight sets.
In the fifth and deciding set of the
match the collegians led, but they were
passed at four-all and lost by a nar
row margin. The scores follow:
Championship singles, final round
Malcolm D. Whitman defeated Lee
Ware, 7â5, 6â4, Bâ6.
Championship doubles, final round
Malcolm D. Whitman and Lee Ware

began last Saturday, was brought to
a close to-day. r Sir Compton Domville,
with the British fleet, won, to use the
language of the turf, in a canter. With
the detached squadon was the Eur*opa,
which had been fitted in a hasty man
ner with the Marconi system of wire
less telegraphy. In another portion of
the fleet the Alexandria, Sir Compton
Domville's flagship, and the cruiser
Juno on which was Signor Marconi
himself, had been also fitted with the
system.
The Juno was ordered to get into
touch as soon as possible with the Eu
ropa on Monday afternoon. It was a
â¢little after 5 when the instrument in
Signor Marconi's cabin gave some
feeble ticks, and then a message was
rapped out that the Europa had
reached her convoy and was to com
municate news to the flagship. ; , : *
When the Juno received this mes
sage she was more than forty miles
from the Europa and more than sev
enty from the convoy. Turning about,
she proceeded back on her course, and
at half past 7, when still more than
thirty miles from the flagship, she re
peated the Intelligence she had received
from the Europa.
A second message, sent in the same
way, is mentioned by the correspond
ent, who estimated the distances of
the Alexandria at the time as thirty
miles from the Juno, fifty-five miles
from the Europa and eighty-eight miles
from the convoy. He says and every
one must agree with him that it is a
veritable triumph for Signor Marconi.
SUIT AGAINST SAN BENITO.
The Sunset Telephone and Telegraph
Company Resents an Attack
Upon Its Privileges.
The Sunset Telephone and Telegraph
Company has instituted an important suit
in the United States Circuit Court against
the Supervisors and the District Attorney
of San Benito County. On July 6, lSa'J. the
Supervisors of the county adopted a reso
lution designed to force the telephone
company to secure a franchise for the use
of the roads in the county. These roads
have been used by the company in the
ordinary transaction of its business. Poles
have been erected and wires have been
stretched, but absolutely no Interference
has been given to traffic of any sort. -
For some reason not clearly explained
the Supervisors suddenly reached a de
termination to make the telephone com
pany pay for privileges which it had long
enjoyed without cost. After the resolu
tion demanding a franchise had been
adopted the Supervisors also began pro
ceedings to remove the "poles and wires
of the telephone company if the franchise
was not obtained. v.-'; _ â 'â  r.
When this had been done the Sunset
Telephone and Telegraph Company took
steps to prevent the Supervisor-- from
carrying out their threats. Suit was in
stituted yesterday, therefore, in the
United States Circuit Court. The com
pany claims that it is operating in San
Benito County under a Federal law which
gives to telephone and telegraph com
panies certain privileges on post leads.
The Circuit Court is asked, therefore, to
issue a permanent injunction restraining
the Supervisors and District Attorney
from carrying out their threats. Pending
a decision of the suit United States Judge
J. H. Beatty has issued a temporary in
junction and restraining order.

CURE OF HON.
WM. MITCHELL
Suffered for Twenty Years
With Catarrh, Stomach,
Sore Eyes and Lung
Troubles.
Was Instantly Relieved by Dr.
Aborn, the Specialist, at
554 Sutter Street.
WELL KNOWN JUDGE OF OREGON
He Testifies in Strong Language to
the Efficiency or Bis Treatment
by Dr. Aborn.
Dr. Aborn's excellent work as a special-
ist in the treatment of obstinate and
chronic diseases of the stomach, lungs,
eye and ear, and all catarrhal and bron-
chial affections is evidenced by the ac-
companying testimonial by Hon. William
Mitchell, County Judge of Morrow Coun-
ty, Oregon, and residing at HeppnÂ«r, In
the county named. Dr. Aborn is the spe-
cialist in diseases of the eye, ear, throat
and lungs: .. â¢"â¢ \y* â ;â¢â¢
THIS IS TO CERTIFY
That for twenty years I was aflllcted
I with catarrh of the head, and also
was suffering from granulated sore
I eyes; my throat and bronchial tubes
j and lungs were also affected, caus-
ing affection of the stomach, which re-
sulted in indigestion and sour stomach,
1 caused by the catarrhal secretions drop-
j ping down from my head into the throat
! and passing Into the stomach. In fact,
I was aflllcted from the crown of my head
! down. I had tried almost all catarrhal
! remedies without being cured, and as the
i disease was so SERIOUSLY AFFECT-
i ING my THROAT, STOMACH and
I LUNGS, I BECAME ALARMED, for I
j knew the disease would soon TERMIN-
! ATE IN CONFIRMED CONSUMPTION.
; I had the measles thirty odd years ago.
j and my eyes have been affected since that
I time. My ears also became affected,
caused by the catarrh, so that I was quit*
hard of hearing. It will be seen by the
I statement of my case that my ailments
j were quite complicated, and I have had
I as many complications of ailments as any
j one man could well endure. In this pain-
I ful and distressing condition I placed my-
\ self under the treatment of Dr. Aborn,
j and I am most happy to state that Dr.
| Aborn has displayed a masterly hand over
jmv complication of diseases, and GAVE
! ME INSTANTANEOUS RELIEF.
Mv catarrhal affection, throat and
stomach, and my eyes have also improved
â  as by magic under his treatment in five
days' time. He ." has also improved my
' hearing. I now return to my home at
I Heppner, Morrow County, Oregon, where
I am County Judge. I am a pioneer set-
â  tier of Umatilla and Morrow counties,
having located In Umatilla County In 1859.
! and I am well known throughout Eastern
i Oregon. From the. speedy relief I have
' received from the skillful and scientific
| treatment at the hands of- Dr. Aborn I
can cheerfully and conscientiously recom-
mend all similarly afflicted to apply to
Dr. Aborn with the utmost confidence
that he understands the SUCCESSFUL
TREATMENT OF THESE OBSTINATE
AND CHRONIC COMPLAINTS. Very
truly, WM. MITCHELL.
I County Judge, Morrow County, Oregon.
Residence, Heppner, Oregon. - â¢ -v.* >__
Thirty years of Dr. Aborn's successful
practice have been devoted to the treat-
ment of diseases of the eye, ear, catarrh
of the head, asthma and all affections of
the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys and diges-
tive organs. Sufferers from these com-
plaints would do well to call upon him
for free consultation. Dr. Aborn's office
hours are from 9:30 a. m. to 12 m. and 2
to 4 p. m. His treatment revitalizes the
system and builds up the Impaired con-
stitution, i â '- ;:â  . . - /_' :. j ,7f j.

Former Executive of America's Me

Has Been a Disappoint

â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Aug. s.â Ex-Mayor W. S.
Strong of New York arrived here to
day en route to San Francisco to meet
his son, who is coming from Manila on
the transport Warren. Mr. Strong pre
dicts that the Republican national
ticket next year will be McKinley and
Hobart. Discussing Governor Roose
velt, he said:
Roosevelt is a very strong man in New
York State, but in order to go before the
people of the whole country we think he
should serve twice as Governor of our
State. He is a young men and will make
a strong man for the 1904 campaign. He's
young enough for that.
If they make the Philippine question one
of the issues of the national campaign
â¦here will be hundreds of New York Dem
ocrats vote for McKinley next year. The
anti-expansion idea is not a strong one.
There are a few who call themselves or
are styled anti-expansionists, but they
are few and amount to very little in New
York.
Personally, I am in favor of retaining
the Philippines. We have acquired all
that territory, and we must keep it, must
retain control, enforce obedience for the
present and allow the future to determine
the ultimate end and the government that
should be enforced there. If the Filipinos
could enjoy three months of our territo
rial government, they would all be will
ing to submit to the regulations and be
content for the American Government to
exercise and superintend their welfare.
They are willing in the main for this now,
as I hear from private sources.
Mr. Strong says that Greater New
York is somewhat of an experiment and
So far a disappointment. The taxes are
more burdensome, especially in some
of the sections like the borough of
Manhattan, but he thinks that in four
or five years the conditions will have
equalized themselves and the taxpay
ers become more content.
Mr. Strong thinks the appointment of
Elihu Root as Secretary of War has
had a good effect in New York.

EPIDEMIC OF YELLOW
FEVER IS ABATING
No New Cases and Only One Death
Is the Day's Record at the
Hampton Home.
WASHINGTON.' Aug. s.â Surgeon Gen
eral Wyman of the marine hospital ser-
vice to-night received a telegram from
Dr. Vickery of the Hampton Soldiers*
Home, in which he said the yellow fever
epidemic seemed limited. No new cases
developed to-day and only one death oc
curred last night. Surgeon Wasdin, the
yellow fever expert, also telegraphed Dr.
Wyman to the same effect. He had con
ferred with Mr. McMahon and Colonel
Smith of the Home Board of Managers
and ill had agreed that the situation was
assuring.
Dr. Wasdin reports forty-two cases and
eleven deaths to date.
STRIKE IS BREWING.
Stockton Street Railway Employes
Have a Grievance.
STOCKTON, Aug s.â Trouble is brewing
among the men employed by the local
street railway company, and it would not
create any surprise if a strike occurred
in the near future. The dissatisfaction
arises over an order about to be issued to
the effect that all of the men must give
bonds, the cost to fall upon themselves.
They claim that as it is now they are un
derpaid in comparison to what operatives
earn In other cities.
The company has long employed the
"spotter" system, which proves expensive.
If it makes the men give bonds the surety
company will supply men to do th'> spying.
The men object to paying from their small
earnings for espionage upon themselves.
When the order is promulgated some de
cisive action by them may result.
Stringing Santa Fe Wires.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. s.â The Santa Fe
now has its own wires into Bakersfield.
The stringing of wires from Barstow- to
Bakersfield was completed yesterday. The
service will at once be continued from Ba
kersfield into San Francisco by way of
Stockton along the right of way of the
San Joaquin Valley road. The wire from
Bakersfield north will, it is expected, be
in operation within sixty days. Although
the Santa Fe lines proper are equipped
with Western Union telegraph offices the
San Joaquin-Valley road has Postal wires
along the roadway. The completion of the
Santa Fe to Point Richmond thus gives
to the Postal another line Into San Iran-
Cisco. i

LONDON, Aug. 5. â The session of ;
Parliament practically ended yesterday
evening and the prorogation will take |
place on Wednesday. There seems to ;
1 be a very general belief that it will be j
the last full session of the present Par- |
liament, shrewd political prophets pre- j
dieting that a general election will be
held next July at the latest.
With the kaleidoscopic transforma
! tions occurring incessantly in foreign
i politics, it is difficult to forecast the I
result of an appeal to the country, but '
: unless some coup rehabilitates the
; prestige of the present Cabinet it is â 
not difficult to foretell a moral disaster
in the shape of an enormously de- j
creased Conservative majority, al- !
though it is hard to Indorse the opti- ;
, mistic views of the Liberals, who ap
; parently are satisfied that a general !
; election will return them to power.
Candid criticism, however, compels the
statement that there are too many
cross currents in the Liberal party to (
admit of success until Lord Rosebery
lor another such Liberal Imperialist
arises to weld the various sections that
are now" following Sir Campbell-Ban- I
i nerman, Sir William Vernon Harcourt
i and John Morley respectively, and to
i proclaim an aggressive programme in- j
j stead of a narrow, negative policy,
I which is confined to purely ob- :
I structive tactics, so characteristic of ,
i the present divergent leadership.
The fifty-third report of the Com- :
j missioners of Lunacy is unpleasant j
I reading. It shows an appalling in- I
crease of madness. In England and
Wales the lunatics on January 1 of the j
present year totaled 105,05 C, an increase
of 3114 over 1898, the largest increase
yet recorded. An analysis shows that
this spread of lunacy is not confined to
any one class, although naturally the
largest increase is among paupers. The :
] situation is regarded as so alarming
1 that an early official inquiry is de
'â  manded into the causes and the best ;
j means of combating them.
Richard Croker, before leaving Lon
don for Southampton, whence he sailed .
for New York on board the American
liner St. Paul, said to a representative
of the Associated Press who asked him
if there was any truth in the report |
that he had purchased the Lakes of
! Killarney: "I never heard of or knew
â¢ anything about any sale of the Lakes :
of Killarnev or Muckross Abbey until I
I read about it in the English papers. I
, expect to come back to London next
'â  spring for the usual three months' rac- j
ing. The New York newspapers won't .
I allow me peace in my own country j
and I am compelled to come over here j
! for it. English newspapers don't mcd- ]
dle with a man's private affairs, ,
: while in America reporters are watch- j
ing my house and following me about |
j the streets in cabs and street cars.
"Why, I can't even go out of town i
: without having a lot of reporters on
the train with me, who are going to
'â  print the names of everybody I speak
to and publish everything 1 do.
"I was driven away from America to
find my pleasures and then accused of
being un-American because I come j
over here for a little rest.
"I am perfectly satisfied with mv
treatment here. I have not won many
races thus far, but I am not losing any
thing by my stables. It takes a long
time to form a good racing stable, be- j
cause the only way to get good horses
is to breed them yourself. I expect to j
breed some good ones by and by from i
â  Dobbins and Americus. and I shall !
keep on racin*" just the same, win or i
lose. I have five horses racing now i
that will continue to run during the j
racing season Salina, Georgiana, Lor- j
etta, Domineer and Bowling Green. j
; Bowling Green is a three-year-old I j
bought at six months old in Madison i
! Square Garden for $120. To-day I
would not take 51500 for him. The only I
i horse, Wishard, my trainer, bought for
me over here was a yearling filly, for j
! which he paid Â£60. !

CLEVELAND, Aug. About 250 repre-
I sentatives of leading houses have signed
I resolutions denouncing the boycott of the

The business agent of the strikers Is
sued a statement this afternoon in which
he says the strikers are not back of the

grateful to their sympathizers who have i
refrained from riding on the cars, but
they are not enforcing the boycott to pun
ish people who are willing to ride on the
cars. \-.. -
This morning's newspapers contained a
statement from Mayor Farley about "pro
fessional labor men," in which no names
were mentioned, but in which the Mayor
severely scored the agitators. This after
noon Peter Witt, a Populist orator,
brought suit for $10,000 damages against
the Mayor and each of the two papers
that published the statement, claiming
that the Mayor referred to him. Mayor
Farley says he does not know Witt and
never saw him.

HONOLULU, July 29.â As every one
Interested Is now discussing Ha
waiian labor problems I thought
that it would be a good idea to
test the public pulse and -scertain
whether any practical solution could be
obtained from the collective wisdom of
some twenty score of representative men
of "all sorts and conditions of men," from
the millionaire to the mechanic. I have
addressed to them two simple questions:
Are you in favor of retaining the
penal contract labor laws? If not, have
you any suggestion to make in con
nection therewith to protect the em
ployers of labor in their investments?
Have you any suggestion to make in
regard to the labor problem of procur
ing sufficient labor for the needs of
our plantations and other industries?
Now, these very innocent and yet, me
thinks. important questions "have raised
a rumpus.'' By some interests they are
regarded as being almost socialistic and
as containing some deep laid scheme to
ruin the. country, while by others they
are deemed to be all that is proper and
gratitude is expressed to The Call for en
deavoring to elicit Information. Cer
tainly there are those who, like a wealthy
planter to-day, believe in an' efficacious
private lobby rather than the expression
of a private opinion in the public press,
and 1 have no doubt that certain interests
of Hawaii will be respectably represented
at Washington during the next session of
Congress; but how the people will Is at
present an unsolved problem, although a
commission is talked of.
I think a sample of the answers received
I over the signatures of the givers will
prove of interest.
Hon. P. C. Jones, ex-Minister of Fi
nance, vice-president of the Bank of Ha
waii and a retired capitalist, well known
in his connection with the ancient and
honorable firm of C. Brewer & Co., says:
1 am in favor of abolishing the pe
nal clause.
I believe that employers of labor can
be protected by adopting profit-sharing
and similar means of giving the la
borer an interest of some kind in the
enterprises.
I would have a flrst-class man se
lected, to be paid a good, liberal sal
ary, to investigate the labor problem
and make reports from time to time,
suggesting whence good men, who will
settle In the country, can be pro
cured and the terms and conditions
upon which they can be induced to
come to the islands.
C. L. Wight, president of Wilder's
Steamship Company, writes:
I am in favor of the present labor
laws. The contracts are fully under
stood by the laborers before they are
entered into. â¢ . 'â _â 
There is no compuision used in the
making of these contracts. Men who
do not sign contracts have no trou
ble in securing work on plantations,
but when work is scarce the free la
borer is discouraged.
The contract insures to laborers
regular employment, a house, fuel,
water (where water is scarce), good
medical attendance, all free of cost.
it insures to employers a stated num
ber of men at stated wages.
1 can see no fault in our present sys
tem. Smart, provident men do not
need assistance In coming to this coun
try nor do tÃey need a contract with
an employer to secure steady work at
good wages.
Improvident, lazy or stupid men need
to be assisted to come to the country,
and a penal contract is necessary to
secure their services after arrival.
Young men who have not been able
to save enough money at the rate of
wages prevailing in the home country
are enabled to come here and at the
high rate of wages prevailing soon pay
off their debt. Such usually receive
an advance in wages over those called
for in the contract. I am employing
young men, Portuguese, who came
her? under contract, at the following
salaries: $110, $80, $75, $7" and 510 per
month.
Hon. William O. Smith, ex-Attorney
I General, says:
I am not in favor of retaining the
penal contiacl system which has here
tofore been enforced in these islands.
I believe that heretofore the system
has been a protection to the public.
For many years the laborers intro
duced from" foreign countries have been
mainly Asiatics without families. This
class of people, as a rule, do not es-
I tablish homes in the country, and in
view of the great proportion of un
married men and the difficulty of iden- '
tification and their lack of knowledge
of civilized institutions the contract
system as heretofore enforced has
been of great benefit in maintaining
law and order, and has been somewhat
in the nature of a police regulation.
As to the best provisions to be made
in the future for agricultural laborers,
I believe that it is for the best inter
i est of the planters and of the commu
nity that greater effort should be made
to encourage American and European
farm laborers to come here. Much.
doubtless, can be done to encourage
these classes to come by means of co
operative and profit-sharing methods.
The Rev. Sereno E. Bishop. D.D., en
! joys an international reputation as a sci
entist and scholar, and also is the editor
of one of our pioneer papers, the Friend.
He is, furthermore, like W. O. Smith, of
pioneer missionary stock. He says:
The penal contract labor laws should
be abolished.
No protection is needed if the em
ployers treat their laborers well and
give them good houses in place of the
. present barracks.
Assisted labor from Europe should
i be permitted to enter under con
! tract.
; Hon. W. F. Frear, Associate Justice of
' the Supreme Court and one of the Ameri
! can-Hawaiian Commissioners, writes:
I / The penal contract labor laws should
be abolished. The penal enforcement
of labor contracts is not necessary to
protect employers in their Invest
ments. Employers would have no dif
ficulty in retaining laborers In suffi
cient numbers and at satisfactory
wages on their plantations if there
were a sufficient number of laborers
in the country. In order to assure the
existence of a sufficient number in the
country proper means should be em
ployed, first, to induce them to come,
and second, to induce them to stay,
! especially the latter. One of the best
i means of accomplishing this is to
i change the labor system in such a way
as to make it attractive to persons
other than Asiatics and then to ascer
tain the best sources of such other
classes of labor and acquaint them
with the facts. *..
A scientific man should be employed
to' study the conditions In these isl
ands and the sources of labor supply
elsewhere and to make recommenda
tions as to the best labor system to
be adopted here and as to the best
sources of labor supply to be drawn
upon. A scientific man is needed just
as much tor 'the investigation of the
labor -problem as for the investigation
of problems of cultivation .and manu
facture. This man should not be mere
ly a so-culled "practical' man. He
should be a thoroughly scientific man.
F. A. Hosmer, president of Oahu Col
lege, states:
I am not in favor of retaining the
periai contract labor. laws. .
The best solution of our labor prob
lem appears to me to be co-operation,
such as can be found to-day on the
Ewa and.Kona plantations.
Hon. Paul Neumann, also an ex Attor
ney General, says:
I am opposed to penal contract labor
laws. They obtain in Guatemala and
other well regulated republics, but we
do not favor them in the Hawaiian
Islands aside from their being in con
travention of the laws of the United
States. I beg to refrain from sugges
tions for the protection of employers.
Apparently they have hitherto been
well able to take care of thenr-elves,
and will, I hope, continue to do so. I
do, however, not object to being con
sulted upon that point In a professional
â way. _ '-â 'â  â -â '-' .._-.--' : --
Only this: Let Congress repeal the
laws against contract labor and assist
ed immigration. There is no "ra'.son
d'etre" for such legislative stupidities.
James W. Girvin, accountant, formerly
Hawaiian Consul at San Diego, and for
the past five years in charge of Chinese
immigration to this country, writes:
I am not interested to one cent in
â¢ the products of contract labor. 1 have
seen it in operation for over thirty
years and have seen it rarely abused
by the employer. Occasionally an em
ployer who has risen from nonentity
abuses the trust reposed in him. In a
hundred instances to one the laborer
takes advantage of his position to tho
loss of his employer. In over CO per
cent of contracts made the contract
acts merely as an imaginary fence.
The rare instances in which the par
venu or some one put In authority
abuses his position have been so mag
nified that "contract system" has be
come a bugbear.
I think the system could be dis
pensed with if there no longer existed
a necessity for advancing the passage
money of the laborer. An unbiased
Legislature should have the deciding
as to retaining the penal contract law.
I consider a proffer to share the prof
its with the laborer will be induce
ment sufficient to bring all the re
quired labor to the country. The world
Is so full of laborers in need of work
that good agents could select from ev
ery nation thousands of men who
would make good citizens and tillers of
the soil. Occasionally the agents
would be deceived, but to no greater
extent than other employers now are.
A diversity of people is a desideratum.
No one race should be brought In dis
proportionate numbers to others.
Professor M. M. Scott, principal of the
High School, say's:
I am emphatically opposed to penal
contract labor laws. I have no sug
gestion to make as to the "protection
of. the employers of labor" unless it is
to let the laborers protect themselves.
Hon. H. M. Whitney, the Nestor of our
press and editor of the Planters' Monthly,
says:
I have always preferred free labor
where obtainable. Whether this is prac
ticable or not in our Isolated position
remains to be seen.
If the same method of obtaining la
bor from Europe is allowed to us as Is
the custom of the United States I see
no reason why there should be any
scarcity of labor in future from Japan
or the Philippines. This latter country
may soon be the open door for us in
this respect.
Hon. A. V. Gear of the Hawaiian
House of Representatives says:
No, I am not in favor of retaining
the penal contract labor laws and I
consider that they were done away
with when the American flag was
raised here, notwithstanding the de
cisions of the Supreme Court to the
contrary. . ...
I believe that the employers of labor
. should look after their own protection
in their investments and that with
proper treatment of their laborers
there will be no serious difficulties in
the labor market. *- 'â¢-: -'â¢.-'.
Capital will command labor and the
problem of securing sufficient labor
for the needs of our agricultural in
dustries is not a difficult one if labor
ers are properly treated and sufficient
ly paid.
â¢Wallace R. Farrington, editor of the
Evening Bulletin, writes:
Emphatically no. The best protec
tion 1 can suggest Is the speedy ex
tension and strict enforcement of the
constitution of the United States and
American labor laws. Since our na
tion has settled the question of human
slavery at a cost of milions of dol
lars and thousands of lives it ill be
comes any citizen of the United States
to request a reconsideration -of the
problem. â â .:â¢'â 'â 
A purchase the value of which de
pends upon penal contract labor laws
should be promptly confiscated like
any other contraband American goods.
Sugar production is the only industry
possibly threatened by Insufficient la
bor. It has yet to be proved that the
institution of the profit-sharing system
will not solve this problem.
Henry Smith, attorney and chief clerk
of the Judiciary Department and an Ha
waiian, says:
I am not in favor of retaining the
penal clause to labor contracts.
A. S. Humphreys, a leading lawyer, who
states that all his Investments are in
sugar securities, says:
Emphatically no. The employers of
labor here need no protection in their
investments except such as is afforded
to such employers In other civilized
countries. Legislators are concerned
in other countries about protecting la
bor against capital. The employers of
labor In these islands can easily stand
an increase in wages of 50 per cent, and
with such increase a sturdy Anglo-
Saxon yeomanry can be secured for
our plantations. In these islands, as
the laws now exist and are enforced- by
complacent officials, the laborer is re
garded as neither worthy of his hire
nor his liberty.
It is not possible to ' secure self
respecting white men to work on our
plantations, under penal contracts, for
$15 or $20 a month. Plantations that aÂ»e
paying 50 per cent on watered stock
have it in their power to dispose of
what they are pleased to call the "la
bor problem" by paying better wages.
Bruce Cartwright, general insurance
agent, says:
I believe in contract labor laws with
out the penal clause. I further believe
in vagrancy laws and their strict en
forcement.
I have every confidence in the wis
dom and ability of the members of the
Planters' Labor and Supply Company,
and believe them able to cope with the
labor question intelligently.
George A. Davis, another of our promi
nent lawyers, says:
As long as Asiatic labor is imported
and employed the penal clause is the
only protection that capital has, and
It should stand. If white labor can be
employed and do the work on the plan
tation the clause must be repealed. I
must confess that I fear that the work
in the caneflelds cannot be performed
by white laborers.
The business interests of the country
must be protected. Congress should
give the planters time In the matter of
the penal clause as to Asiatic laborers.
Corporal punishment should be done
away with, and any manager who al
lows it on the plantations should be
â  prosecuted. : ;> y* ..
I would like to see the negroes of the
South sent here in large numbers.
They can do the work and would make
good citizens if treated properly.
Frederick W. Hankey is one of the
bright lawyers who have recently joined
us from the mainland. He says:
No. Capital protects itself. The most
engrossing problem of the age Is as
to how labor shall be protected, not
alone from motives of justice, but to
solve a question vital to the endur
ance of free government. Wipe out
the disgraceful statutory laws called
"penal contract laws." They should
have no place in the laws of American
territory. . .':Â»'-â¢,â¢ ;.;,'"â '
I think free white labor can be se
cured and that proper wages can be
paid and the stock companies still
avoid bankruptcy. The climatic con
ditions do not seem to me unfavorable.
Fred Wunderberg, formerly very promi
nent In Hawaiian affairs but now a capi
talist retired on sugar stock, says:
I am not and never have been in
favor of the penal feature In the con
tract system. The vagrant laws if
properly applied would in a large
measure compensate for the loss of
the contract system.
This Is a vexed question and has
been talked and written about ever
since I can remember. Numerous ex
periments have been tried and nearly
all have proved failures with the ex
ception of the Chinese and Japanese.
This is a tropical country and the only
industries that have thus far proved
successful are sugar and rice, and tak
ing our past for a standard it is safe
to say that these could never have
reached any proportions were it not
for Asiatic labor. , _
Hon. Alatan T. Atkinson, member of
the Hawaiian House of Representatives,
ex-Inspector General of Schools., and of
the Census of 1896 and now editor of the
Hawaiian Star, writes:
I am entirely opposed to the penal
clause in labor contracts. I do not
think special laws should be made with
regard to the protection of employers.
I believe that the law of supply and
demand, which is above all human leg
islation, will regulate the matter sat
isfactorily. :.':- â '. ;':â "â -
Wherever there is a demand for
labor, if it is made known to the
proper sources, labor will come. I do
not think that the Government should
meddle in the matter. It should be
left entirely to the energy and push
of the employers of labor to supply
their wants.
Edmund Norrie, editor of the Independ
ent, writes:
The present labor laws are infamous
and should be repealed at once. When
employers of labor will be satisfied
with reasonable interest on their in
vested capital and pay proper wages
their investments will be amply pro
tected.
All necessary labor can be obtained
as soon as fair wages are offered and
the words "cheap labor" stricken from
the planter's dictionary.
Dr. W. S. Noblitt, who has been a firm
friend to suffering plantation hands and
poor laborers, writes:
No. Let the present law of no exemp
tion remain, and then if a laborer vio
lates his agreement let the planta
tion garnishee the laborer's wages
when he gets new employment in case
the laborer has not paid the planta
tion all he owes it.
Let the planters get laborers from
America. There are thousands of able
bodied young men in the Middle
States working for $12 and $15 per
month during six months of the year
and the remaining six months are
practically idle. These men can be in
duced to come here.
Charles L. Rhodes, city editor of the
Hawaiian Star, writes:
1 am decidedly opposed to retaining
the penal enforcement of labor con
tracts. Indeed I would like to see a
special session of the Hawaiian Leg
islature called at once to repeal that
feature of the law. I do not believe
the penal enforcement of labor con
tracts considered in all its effects and
influences is of any real benefit to em
ployers of labor; hence the repeal of
this feature would call for no legisla
tive substitute.
The question of a supply of laborers
will work itself out. During the work
ing out process and period there may
be and doubtless will be some embar
rassment and difficulty. This embar
rassment and difficulty is a matter of
industrial administrative detail to be
dealt with by the individual Employers
of labor. The planters, for whom the
greatest concern is expressed, seem to
be addressing themselves with hon
esty and sagacity to the subject. With
in the principles of freedom to con
tract and fair dealing they ought not
to be hampered.
1 will close by borrowing an idea from
a distinguished friend, who for forty
years has fought the abominable penal
law. He is of opinion that sooner or later
there will be established a company of
Americans who will guarantee the plant
ers against the desertion of their laborers
and secure them against the loss of the
money advanced to the laborers for their
passage money. The field is open.
Over 2000 Japanese have been landed in
this port within the last thirty days, 1500
more are on the road hither and 5000
others have been arranged for in Japan
and art only awaiting the signature of
the contracts to Invade the island. In
course of time these laborers desert the
sugar plantations for the better wages
of the coffee groves and thence migrate
into town or become road-building con
tractors. An instance in point is to be '
found in Hawaii, where a Japanese con
tractor has obtained contracts to the
value of $11,000 out of $17,000; underbidding
both Hawaiians and Portuguese, and the
latter are cheaper than Chinese.
It has not yet leaked out, but I have it
from very good authority that the rep
resentative of one of our leading plan
tations calculated upon obtaining a few
hundred Chinese from California, where
the field labor is much cheaper than the
wages demanded by the free laborers
among the Chinese now here and who, in
all grades of employment, are demanding
I higher wages. Believing that as the Stars
j and Stripes now waved over his island
home it was an integral part of the
United States he proceeded to interview
the United States special agent for Chi
nese immigration, Mr. Brown, as to the
best and most facile method of importing
them from the mainland.
He was astonished at learning that the
flag cut no figure in this case. Hawaii is
to all intents and purposes a foreign
country with the ban upon it. . While it
is a part of the United States yet Chinese
cannot be imported from any other por
tion of the United States. No Chinese can
land here except those permitted to land

It is just these people that Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery is designed to

" When I first wrote you I was completely dis- .
couraged," says Mrs. W. M. Satterly. living at
Richford, Tioga Co., N. Y. (P, O. Box 40), in a
letter to Dr. Pierce. " I was in pain all the time,
could not lie in bed on account of severe, sharp
cutting pains in my back and right hip. Had
pain all through the lower part of ray body and
my elbows hurt me so much I could scarcely
lift mv baby. My skin was dry, harsh and
scaly and hung like sacks on my arms. My
husband called the doctor, and he said it was
weakness, and my age. His medicine did me
no good. I kept getting worse and weaker. It
seemed I should go crazy. One day I wrote
you and received advice. I have taken Dr.
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery, his ' Fa-
vorite Prescription ' and ' Pleasant Pellets,' and
now I can lie in bed with some comfort and can
do a good day's work."

under the special exempt clause, such as
merchants, etc. No Chinese laborer can
land here no matter whence he came.
Perhaps even a more interesting fact
connected with the labor system is the
resignation of J. F. Hackfeld, the Consul
for Austria-Hungary, under whose pro
tection the imprisoned Galicians were
presumed to be. Mr. Hackfeld's public
explanation of his resignation is that he
finds it embarrassing to be at the same
time a stockholder in a sugar plantation
and a Consul having to listen to com
plaints of laborers employed on that plan
tation. The affairs of the Consulate nave
been temporarily handed over to F. A.
Schaefer. the Consul for Italy and dean
of the Consular corps, a gentleman who
is to a large extent in the same embar
rassing duality of responsibility. It is un
natural, of course, to presume for one
moment that the revived story of the im
prisoned Galicians and the charges of cru
elty they have recently brought have any
thing to do with the ex-Consul's action;
but while the Government remains very
reticent as to its intentions I have grounds
for stating that a careful but quiet Inves
tigation into these charges of gross cruelty
â which, curiously enough, were never
brought at the time of the arrest nor until
two of the principal witnesses had passed
out of sight with a German friend of so
cialistic tendenciesâ -Is being made not
only by the Government immigration offi
cials but also by private attorneys for the
different interests concerned.
I have conversed with the warden of
the prison, Mr. Henry, and also with the
editor of the Independent, Mr. Norrls,
who first called attention to the gross in
justice attaching to the imprisonment of
these men, and both state emphatically
that until the interview with the editor of
the Volcano no mention of such cruelty
had been made by the men.
Mr. Henry states that the interview was
an honest one and honestly reported, but
he thinks It strange that they had never
told him previously that they had been
brutally treated. He imputed the trouble
to their being absolutely green hands at
any kind of field labor and to the natural
Irritation of lunas who did not speak
their language. His lunas had consider
able trouble to teach them road-making,
but with kindness and patience they have
become willing workers and expert at
their work.
But they will not listen to his advice to
go back to work on the plantation, hold
ing that they understood before they left
Bremen that they were to be employed
at their different mechanical trades and
to have a house and lot of land. This
matter has now reached such a stage
that a demand has been forced for prose
cution either of those publishing the facts
of the alleged cruelty or of the plantation
lunas for committing it, and the resigna
tion of Mr. Hackfeld will probably expe
dite matters.
I have been reliably informed this morn
ing that it is the intention of a number
of the opponents to the penal contract
labor laws and to the continued Incar
ceration of the Imprisoned Galicians and
other laborers to raise a fund by private
subscription to send an attorney to Wash
ington to confer with the Washington au
thorities in regard to the constitutionality
of this imprisonment under existing con
ditions. The name of George D. Gear,
formerly of the California bar. Is men
tioned as the special commissioner. An
effort is also being made to induce the
Government to call an extra session of
the Legislature to repeal the penal law.
SUMMONS SERVED ON
LITTLEFIELD LYNCHERS
Two Men to Be Tried for the Murder
Committed Three Years
Ago.
COVELO, Aug. s.âDeputy Sheriff
Greenwell of Trinity County to-day served
a summons on Fred Radcllff to appear on
August 16 at Weaverville for trial for
complicity in the Littlefleld lynching.
Radcliff was employed by John Matthews
of Eden Valley, fifteen miles south of
Round Valley. He Is under a $10,000 bond
filed about three years ago.
Deputy Sheriff Greenwell also served
summons on Thomas C. Hayden. who
lives in the southern part of Trinity
County, on the same charge.
Crocker's Offer Considered.
SAN JOSE. Aug. 5. âA meeting of grape
growers of the county was held here to
day to consider H. J. Crocker's proposi
tion for a seven-year contract, $14 to be
paid for all grapes except Malvolsie and
Mission, for which $12 will be paid. A
few signed the contract but the majority
wanted further time for consideration. A
committee to obtain signatures was ap
pointed.

JUNEAU, Alaska, Aug. 1 (via Seat
tle, Aug. s).â The truth about Cape
Nome, if anybody wants to read it, has
come to the surface at Juneau. It came
down from the far north last night on
the Pacific Steam Whaling Company's
well-known steamer Excelsior, which
has carried so much treasure from the
north to San Francisco and which is
now running from Juneau to the west
ward, along with a number of disap
pointed gold seekers from Cape Nome,
Valdez and St. Michael. A sad feature
of Cape Nome is that the experience of
Copper River is likely to be repeated
there.
James White, an old miner and pros
pector of Juneau and well known here,
came down on the Excelsior from Cape
Nome. He went there with "Jack" McÂ»
Question of Yukon fame in the first
rush from Dawson last spring. Mr.
White said:
"Cape Nome is a frost. There is not
a claim in the country that can be
made to pay. At first two or three
prospects went 75 cents to the pan
at the rim, but that soon played out.
There is not a paying claim in the dis
trict.
"In Snow and Anvil gulches, on
Snake Creek, there were a few good
prospects at first, but that is all. The
further down you go into the ground
the worse it gets. You find two or three
feet of loose chicken-feed gravel, then
a layer of ice, then some more gravel
and then some more ice, and so on.
That stuff can't carry gold, and it
don't.
"There isn't any wash gravel in the
country. The whole country is staked
for thirty miles from the coast. This
Is true of Snake Creek and another
creek which heads up into the same
range of mountains. Most of the lo
cations have been made by power of
attorney. There isn't a stick of timber
in the whole country as big as your
wrist. Willow switches sticking up
out of the snow and gravel show the
boundaries of the claims.
"Down on the beach about 2500 people
are camped. All the ground is taken.
They don't know which way to go or
what to do. It's a case of stay there
till the food is eatenâand then what?
Many haven't enough money to get out
of the country. Food is cheap eggs
are 75 cents a dozen and potatoes 10
cents a pound. We went there to buy
some claims, but concluded we did not
want any of it."
"Jack" McQuestion went to San-
Francisco on the steamer Bertha.

THE INSPECTOR
GENERAL'S DUTIES
Order Defining Them
Made Public.
A WIDE LATITUDE GIVEN
BUREAU MADE PART OF THE
WAR DEPARTMENT.
Authority Given to Inquire Into
Everything Pertaining to the
Welfare of the
Army.
.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. s.â The order
fixing the status of the Inspector gen
eral's office was made public at the
War Department to-day. It is dated
July 31, and is signed by Secretary
Alger. The important feature of the
order is that it makes the Inspector
General's Department a bureau of the
War Department. It says in part:
'The Inspector General's Depart
ment is the department of Inspections
of the army and the inspector gen
eral is charged, under the Secretary of
War, with the supervision of all stated
inspections. His office is a bureau of
the War Department and is the reposi
tory of the reports of all such inspec
tions. The sphere of inquiry of the In
spector General's Department includes
every branch of military affairs ex
cept when specially limited in these
regulations or In orders. Inspectors
general and acting inspectors general
will exercise a comprehensive and gen
eral observation within the commands
to which they may be respectively as
signed over all that pertains to the effi
ciency of the army, the condition and
state of supplies of all kinds, of arms
and equipments, of expenditures, of
public property and moneys and the
condition of accounts of all disbursing
officers of every branch of the service;
of the conduct, discipline and efficiency
of officers and troops, and report
with strict impartiality in regard to all
Irregularities that may be discovered.
From time to time they will make such
suggestions as may appear to them
practicable for the correction of any
defect that may come under their ob
servation.
"Inspectors general or acting inspec
tors general are assigned to armies,
army corps, divisions and geographical
departments by the Secretary of War
and are under the immediate direction
of their commanding generals. When
not so assigned they are 'solely under
the orders of the Secretary of War and
the commanding genera] of the army.
When assignments have not been made
to armies, army corps, divisions and
geographical departments, or to fill
temporary vacancies, commanding
generals may detail officers from their
commands for such duty, reporting
their action to the War Department
for the information of the inspector
general.
"All depots, armories, arsenals and
public works of every kind under
charge of officers of the army will be
inspected annually by officers of the
Inspector General's Department. These
inspections will include military and
business administration and methods,
but will not extend to the scientific or
technical character of work for which
the officer in charge is responsible,
through the head of his department,
to the Secretary of War."

NEW FRATERNITY HALL
ON STANFORD CAMPUS
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. 5.â
The Phi Delta Theta fraternity of
Stanford University is about to erect
an elegant new house on the campus.
The contracts were signed to-day and
work will be commenced Immediately, so
the house will be ready for occupancy the
latter part of October. The cost will be
about $"000.
The new Phi Delta Theta house will be
the handsomest of the group of fraternity
houses on the campus. It is designed in
the Spanish mission style of architecture,
to harmonize with the Stanford quad
rangle and will be situated on the south
side of Lasuen street. The house will
consist of a central portion three stories
in height, with two-story wings on either
side. The exterior will be finished in
plaster with red roof, and there will be
a broad porch In front, with roof sup
ported by large pillars, and the windows
In front will open on small balconies.
On the first floor will be a spacious re
ception-hall, with beamed ceiling, and a
tall fireplace with the fraternity coat-of

CONFERENCE OF DEMOCRATS AT
SARATOGA.
â â
It Is Felt That Bryan by His Recent
Prominence Has Aroused
Too Many Antag
onisms.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SARATOGA. N. V., Aug. -The talk
about a conference of Democratic lead
ers from all sections of the country to
be held in Saratoga has materialized.
There is evidently a general feeling
that Bryan may not be as available a
candidate for President next year as
some other man who has not been so
prominently before the country and has
: thus escaped the arousing ot. so many
| antagonisms as the Nebraska leader.
j It is this feeling that has given rise
; to a boom for Judge Augustus Van
Wyck of New York, and there is no
disguising the fact that what was at
first considered mere speculation has
become a reality of the most substan
! tial kind. Judge Van Wyck, who made
I a strong race for Governor of New
! York last year against even Roosevelt's
1 phenomenal popularity, has been in
j Saratoga several days, and among the
. representative Democrats who have
been in frequent" conferences with him
'and his enthusiastic supporters among
j party leaders of New York City and
'â  this State generally is William F. Har
rity of Pennsylvania, former chairman
of the Democratic National Committee.
' The principal point urged is that Van
! Wyck being a man of Southern birth,
| popular where he is known and unob-
j ectionable everywhere, would repre
! sent not only the anti-Bryan sentiment,
i but would draw considerable strength
' from the Bryan element itself in Its
strongholds. â¢
Judge Walker of Missouri, who is
1 supposed to represent Governor Stone
i of that State, went so far as to say
that Colonel Bryan himself, if he finds
i sentiment so strong against his renom-
I ination as to render his availability
' doubtful in the minds of his friends,
' will refuse to accept another nomina
', tion. _
Either Judge Van Wyck or Governor
Stone would then be the logical candi
date. Others who agree with Walker
j say that Van Wyck and Stone would
make a winning combination.

On the opposite side of the hall will be
the dining-room. These three rooms are
so arranged that they may be thrown to

be used for entertaining and dancing.
Besides these rooms on the first floor
there will be a chapter and smoking

The second and third floors are arranged^
with rooms to accommodate twenty men,
there being eight bedrooms and study

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Aug. 5.â A regular passen
ger train hauled by an electric motor is
a novelty which the Now York. New
Haven and Hartford Railroad has lust
introduced upon its Plymouth division.
The long combination trains which are
drawn out of Boston by a powerful
steam locomotive as far as the junc
tion at Braintree are broken in two
at that point.
Hitherto an engine has been left in
waiting there to take from four to
seven passenger cars over the branch
to Cohasset and back. The place of
this locomotive is now filled by an
electric third rail car. or "motor." as
the railroad men call it, specially de
signed for work.
This motor is built very much like
the ordinary combination smoking and
baggage car used on suburban trains.
It usually has a trolley to be used on
overhead wires at stations and at grade
crossings and trucks adapted for a
third rail feed on stretches of road.
The motorman does not stand on the
platform, but has a little control room
partitioned off in the corner of the car,
from which he manipulates powerful
brakes.
All local trains between Braintree
and Cohasset, a distance of twelve
miles, are now drawn by motors, and
no difficulty is experienced in making
the regular "schedule time. Experimen
tal runs have been made at the rate
of eighty miles an hour over a third
rail, and the electric motor has hauled
long trains of loaded dump cars
against a steam locomotive pulling in
the opposite direction.
ACCUSED OF HAVING

Two Young Women Arrested at the

BOLINAS, Aug. s. âConsiderable excite
ment was created yesterday by the arrest
of Charles Purgeson, Miss Carrie Burge
son and Miss May Fitzpatrick on a war
rant charging them with house-breaking.
The warrant was issued on a complaint
sworn to by Thomas McGovern. alleging
that they entered his hotel during his ab
sence and carried away a piano.
The i tano seems to have been the prop
erty of Mrs. McKee, who rented it to
McGovern. the proprietor of the Hotel
del Mar. After Burgeson and his friends
got possession of the instrument they told
li to A. Braun of Willow Camp, who still
holds it. The arrested persons were taken
before a Justice of the Peace and pleaded
not guilty. The hearing of the case was
fixed lor' Monday.
REPAIRS FOB AN EASEMENT.
Plan That Means an Ultimate Saving
for the State.
WOODLAND, Aug. s.â The Sacramento
Chamber of Commerce seems to be alive
to the necessity of protecting the ease
ment, which did so much splendid work
last winter, and probably will institute an
inquiry by Attorney General Ford as to
the possibility of the use of any part of
the appropriation to keep the work al
ready accomplished in repair. All this
doubt and confusion is due to the lapse
of the office Of Commissioner of Public
Works, owning to the bungling work of
the last Legislature.
If the State Board of Examiners will
give assurance that the bills for material
and labor necessary to make the repairs
will be allowed, the late Commissioner
and Engineer Nurse will personally -su
perintend and direct the work without
cost to the State. Assurances have been
received that the Controller will not ob
ject to such claims.

is brooding over Berlin. Nearly every- ;
body of consequence is absent and poli- j

watering-places, seashores and moun- j

The papers editorialize on recondite sub- j

most totally lacking. Although the Diet I
reassembles August 16 the fate of the ca- :
nal bill is as uncertain as ever. Its j
chances have not improved during the va- |
cation. The Center, whose help is vital, |
insists on the passage first of- the com- j
munal reform bill, to which arrangement, j
the Prussian Government seriously ob- I

determined. Even the fact that the Em

COUNTRY ORDERS RECEIVE PROMPT ATTENTION.
troubles in the island the influential Na
tional Zeitung remarks: We attach
slight significance to these American
press voices. For some time to come
the American craving for activity will he
satisfied with the solution of the Philip
pine question. In Hayti. doubtless, the
â¢Americans would not be welcomed. Hor
rors committed by the United Stales al
most daily against colored people will
hardly tell in favor of an American pro
tectorate with the Hftytien negroes and
mulattos. Even in Cuba the colore" . peo
ple have already received proofs of the
Ineradicable antipathy of the American*
toward the blacks."
Events in the Transvaal are keenly
watched here. The press comments lib
erally on the week's news. No doubt a
strong undercurrent of sentiment exists,
shared by every class, in favor of the
Boers against Great Britain. Every Ger
man one meets expresses this freely, and
the press, except the portion Inspired by
the Government, sides more or less
strongly with the Boers. An editorial in
the Deutsche Zeitung is significant as
showing . the aspirations in pan-German
and colonial circles. It concludes as fel
lows:
"Questionable as it remains, after all,
whether England, which, in a war with
the Boers, would have to dangerously ex
pose all her threatened points, in Asia, is
really resolved to fight, it seems settled,
fudging from the consonance of news
from London and Lisbon, that the pos
sihilitv of war is not being seriously con
sidered. The near future may show
whether the British flag will be unfolded
for a fight in which nothing less is to be
decided than the question whether Africa
is to become English or German-Dutch.
"A further sign of the deep interest in
the matter "here is the large number of
pamphlets and books on the question
which have appeared within a month. All
the periodicals also contain articles on
the Transvaal question. It seems doubt
ful, however, whether the Government
or the Emperor will again interfere if
things come to a focus in South Africa."
It is currently reported in political cir
cles that his Majesty, on the occasion of
the visit of Cecil Rhodes to Berlin, said:
"The Boers are past saving," adding that
"they owed their misfortunes to their
own, stubbornness" and that there was no
intention on the part of Germany to call
a halt to England. .â¢*.-'
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns that there has been a great
veering around of opinion in Government
circles, partly owing to the circumstan
tial reports of the new German Consul at
Pretoria.
During his trip in northern waters the
Emperor has been kept closely informed
regarding the changes in the whole mat
ter, and on his arrival at Kiel a minute
verbal report was made to him. A high
official said to the Associated Press cor
respondent this week:
"It is certain that the Emperor, and
with him Count Bulow and Prince Ho
henlohe, have beome convinced that to
actively meddle in the Transvaal question
at the present stage would be to stir up a
hornet's nest. Germany has come to the
conclusion that it is best for her interests
to let things take their natural course."
A large portidn of the press this week
called attention to the "enormous pro
posed increase" of the American navy.
The Oeste Asiatische Lloyd points out
that America is building forty-six war
vessels and that the construction of
twelve more was ordered during the last
session of Congress. This, it adds, in the
near future will give a new complexion to
the Far Eastern question.
This article has been much commented
upon and a number of papers in close re
lation with the Government have begun
a campaign in favor of another large in
crease in the German navy. Even the
Conservative Neuests Nachrichten, the
organ of Dr. Miquel, the Prussian Minis
ter of Finance, strongly insists that such
an increase is necessary unless Germany
wishes to "abdicate the influential posi
tion she has acquired in the East." add
ing, "Germany must be able to keep per
manently at least one division ot Â«irst
class ironclads in the far East."
The first torpedo boat of a new type has
Just been launched at the Schlchau yards. j
The fact that a number of small torpedo
boats have been lost at sea during the I
past five years has induced the Govern
ment to abandon the smaller type.
All the torpedo boats built for Germany
hereafter will be sixty-eight meters long,
drawing nine feet of water and will be
among the swiftest vessels of their class
afloat. They will steam thirty-five knots ;
and will have two funnels and two tur
rets.
From a gentleman in the entourage of
the Emperor the correspondent of the As
sociated Press learns that the Emperor
is greatly elated at the success of his
yacht Meteor at Cowes. He exclaimed
when he received the news:
"Now I. have sent them home beaten in
their own waters."
His Majesty then ordered champagne
for everybody on board . the imperial
yacht Hohenzollern.

FORCES IN LINE FOR
THE PRIMARY ELECTION
Ugly Feeling Between Rainey
and Buckley Factions.
Each Party Has Finished the Work of Re
vising Delegate Nominations â
Filed With the Registrar.
Â£-__â _*}HE political forces are in line
T for the first battle under the
j rules of the primary election.
L The regular Republicans ad
justed their differences in the
â¢--eighth and Forty-fourth As
sembly districts last night and for
warded the revised tickets to the Regis
trar of Voters. In the Thirty-eighth
tho names of George H. Pippy, E. P.
Barrett and B. Bierbo were taken from
the ticket and the vacancies filled by
putting on 1. Schwartz, George Tantau
and A. W. Liezhgi. In the Forty
fourth District the regular Republican
club' indorsed the Grand Hotel ticket.
Indications are that the Democratic
Committee of One Hundred will not
recognize any ticket in the Fortieth
District. A request at headquarters
last night for a copy of the committee's
ticket elicited the reply that the organ
ization bad no candidate, in that dis
trict. The fight between Hassett and
Rock in the Fortieth will be settled at
the polls. Rock is said to 'be a can
didate for Sheriff, and Phelan's friend
Hassett is probably looking for an of
fice of some kind. The Buckley ticket
in the Fortieth is headed by Charles
J. Heggerty.
â¢ 'allagher's Democratic ticket in the
Thirty-eighth District is being boosted
by the Rainey-Examiner League. The
Committee of One Hundred is behind
the . Bert Schlesinger ticket. Buckley
has made up a ticket from both fac
tions.
A delegation of Democrats visited
The Call office last night to assure this
paper that the James D. Phelan Club
of the Thirty-ninth Assembly District
v. as a band of Raineyites, and that the
ticket headed by Edward T. Burke, and
which contained the names of Jim Fen
ton, Abe Goldstone, Jake Harris. W. J.
Gavigan and others would derive its
chief, support from the Fire Depart
ment -..â and the Rainey-Examiner
League. . The firemen, backed by the
Examiner, will make a determined ef
fort to elect that ticket and the Galla
gher Club ticket.
The Valley Democratic Club is mak
ing an earnest fight to elect a ticket
headed by William J. Egan. The club
' " T " """'__ THE EMPORIUM. I
has issued a proclamation in which it
denounces the constantly increasing in
terference by carpet-bagging political
interlopers in the affairs of the Democ
racy cf the Thirty-seventh District.
The* Valley Club claims to be a stanch
supporter of the constitution and Jef
fersonian principles. From a nucleus
of less than twenty members, it has
grown until its enrollment represents
615 voters in the valley. In the address
to Democrats the club says:
"During the reign of the Committee
of One Hundred, of nauseous memoryâ
the ragtail of which is again striving to
twist itself around the throat of the
regenerated Democracyâ Valley Club
remained true to its principles and
emerged from the conflict, in which the
Democratic forces received the igno
minious defeat principally by the self
ish methods of said committee, un
scathed and intact. From the start
Valley Club has insisted on a new char
ter and a primary law, and its best
endeavors were directed toward elect
ing the freeholders and carrying the
charter to a successftri issue. Later it
adopted resolutions strenuously de
nouncing the attempt of those who are
trying to have the law declared uncon
stitutional. On the eve of a primary

new primary lawâ members of Val

ley Club exhort all those who are in 1
sympathy with its objects to cast their
ballots for its nominees and thus in
sure the election of those who in return
will cast their votes for candidates
pledged for an honest and economical
management of municipal affairs."
It is understood that these stalwart
Democrats of the valley will go to the
polls next Tuesday luting for James
D. Phelan and Christopher a. Buckley
and crying "Down with bosses and
bossism!"
In the several Assembly districts res
ident Republicans have had their own
way in presenting candidates for the
municipal convention., At the outset
they gave notice thai boss Interference
would not be tolerated. The City Re
publican League, as a centralized or
ganization, sought at first to revise
district nominations, but the revision
soon took the form of re-reference. The
tickets presented by the regular organ
ization and the Grand Hotel Commit
tee contain the names of many sterling
citizens. There is assurance that the
Republican convention in point of
character, Intelligence and progressive
citizenship will far surpass any con
vention that can be evolved from the
various Democratic tickets in the field.
Every Democratic faction is headed by
a boss, and each delegate ticket put
forward is the product of bossism. The
names of several prominent citizens
may be found on the lists of each fac
tion, but names which stand for the
best examples of citizenship are com
paratively few.
Republicans should go early to the
polls. The corrupt and boss driven
factions of the Democracy have im
ported stuff ers and rounders. Good
citizens going late to the polls may find
that their names have been voted by
repeaters. There- are signs that the
Raineyltes of the Fire Department and
the Buckley heelers may clash. To-day
Chief Dees may be advised that orders
were given to the men of one engine
company to take their â¢ "spanners" to
the polls and "knock every Buckley
block in the way." There is no doubt
of the ability of the police force to pre
serve order, and steps may be taken to
have "hose spanners" for that day
classed as concealed weapons.

Advisory Central Club Holds
Another Sessionâ Other Re
publican Meetings.
Another meeting of the Advisory Cen
tral Club of the Republican party was
held last night in the Shiels building. The
meeting was as mild as a zephyr in June.
Promptly at 8:30 o'clock Chairman Eddy
called the meeting to order. The roll was
called and as there were but forty-one of
the ninety delegates present a ten min
utes' delay was necessary until represen
tatives from various districts could be
called in from neighboring halls. The
reading of the minutes of the previous
meeting was dispensed with and then
' Joseph S. Spear Jr., chairman of the com-
I mittee on permanent organization read
the following report, which was adopted
without a dissenting voice:

Nominations for vice-presidents then be
ing in order, James A. Snook placed Gen
era] K. H. Warfleld In nomination and W.
H. George likewise nominated Senator
Thomas C. Maher. Both nominations met
with the approval of those present and
both gentlemen were unanimously elected
first and "second vice-presidents, respec
tively. George Dletterle nominated John
Lackmann for treasurer, and the mem
bers were so pleased with the Supervisor's
choice for the position that he was im
mediately elected. William J. Lenox was
honored with the office of sergeant-at
arms. If the meetings .continue like last
night's he will certainly have a sinecure.
A recess was taken for live minutes so
that Chairman Eddy could confer with
the members with a view to appointing
an executive committee. On reconvening
Colonel Eddy appointed William 11. Pow

night Dr. Campbell Ford presided; E. M.

A mass meeting of the six Democratic
clubs of the Thirty-first district was held |
In Teutonia Hall last evening, Tim E. i
Treacy acting as president. Bonfires
were in evidence on Howard and Ninth j
streets and a band discoursed cheering |
music, which had the effect of crowding j
the hall to a greater extent than It has i
been during the present campaign, even
by the hosts of the Committee of One
Hundred. Treacy started the ball rolling
by a vigorous speech in favor of pure i
politics and loyalty to the Democracy. He
scored those who were trying to make It |
appear that they were using Phelan as |
a cloak. His indorsement of the Mayor (
was made in no uncertain terms and
evoked great applause from his auditors. ,
Charles Asmussen, the young orator and
graduate of Stanford, took up the entire j
twenty-one names of the district which !
are proposed for delegates. His eulogy
of each one was eloquent and spoken ;
from personal acquaintance with each â 
individual. â¢ Â:.-:'
T. 1.. Clancy, one of the nominees for .
election at the next primaries, recounted |
his experience as an old business man j
in the district, and then proceeded to
eulogize the administration of Mayor i
Phelan. He Bald he was for that gentle- j
man first, last and all the time. â â¢ He also
advised harmony in the Democratic ;
ranks and predicted that many Repub- |
licans would follow their victorious ban- c
ncr, thus making this a Democratic year.
Charles H. Holeomb and several others
addressed the meeting, which did not con
clude until 11 o'clock. ':'.'. '

the wages at Mare Island. They present

the coast showing the wages paid in
nearly every case under consideration to
be higher eleswhere than on the navy
yard. President McConnell of the Ship
fitters' Association submitted strong evi
dence in favor of his and kindred trades.

Spanish - American
War Panorama
Is one of the war books which is likely
to be in continuous demand. It is a
panoramic record of the triumphs of
Yankee Doodle. The eagle flaps his
wings on every page, and "Old Glory**
waves around and above every scene.
Prominent officers connected with the
war are here portrayed, as well as
many of the "men behind the guns."
Military life is pictured to the eye, from
recruiting to guard mount and skirmish
line. Nor is the ludicrous omitted. The
company cook receives the attention
due. to his importance; the mess is
shown; cavalry scenes are given; the
hospital arrangements are depicted; the
heroines of the Red Cross service are
displayed; street scenes in Havana.
Santiago and elsewhere are unrolled,
the new citizens or subjects (which are
they?) of Uncle Sam appear and dis-
appear as the leaves are turned.
In a word, the gazer visits the new-
localities and sees the tumultuous new
life, without the risk or expense of a
sea voyage.

AIERCENORY EXPANSION.
â 
CONGRESSMAN BERRY of Kentucky, a
I Democrat, says:
"I am for expansion for purely commercial
reasons. I want this country to gain new markets.
After the war in the Philippines is- over we will com
mand the trade there."
This sentiment is echoed by such Southern Demo
cratic papers as the Atlanta Constitution, the Chatta
nooga Times and Memphis Appeal.
No argument is needed to expose the novelty of
this motive as an American policy. It is purely mer
cenary. Our wars heretofore waged, and always suc
cessfully, have had an ineffable principle as their rea
son. In every case the rights of man, ideas rooted in
liberty of conscience and of person, have been the
stake for which our citizens have gladly borne arms
and cheerfully died in battle. The mercenary feature
or the legitimate profits of human opportunity were
entirely subsidiary and secondary. Emerson put it in
his poem at the Boston anniversary:
"Of what avail are plow and sail.
Or land and life, if freedom fail?"
We entered upon the Spanish war resolving all
doubts in favor of the humane reason and the rights of
men denied.
The declaration of Mr. Berry' changes all this. We
are to make military conquests to extend trade, not
liberty:, to enlarge the profits of commerce, not the
rights of man. This requires that we call upon our
young men to go halfway around the world, under a
vertical sun and in an unfriendly climate to die in
battle for the enlargement of the opportunities of
money, not man. Let it be remembered that this view
is taken by those who favor the policy. It is not an
invention of the anti-imperialists, but a deliberate
declaration of the imperialists themselves. If the peo
ple agree to it. and bear the consequent drain of life
and treasure, it will go on. No one can resist that
which a majority of eighty millions of people agree
to do.
But to do it is inconsistent with the past genius and
character of the American people. We have been the
most willing fighters in history, when the stake was
ideal and sentimental. But we are asked to lay down
our lives for the sale of more pork and flour. The poetic
principle which inspires heroism in war is lacking and
the results to be pointed to are not the many made
happier and more secure in the common rights of
man. but the few made richer by profits of a commerce
on a field manured by the blood of free men.
We have now the best markets of any nation and
they did not cost a tear, a wound nor a drop of blood.
We have outstripped the commercial nations that have
shed the gore of their people to extend their com
merce. The contest will be between those who believe
that markets can be won by commercial intelligence
and those who think they are the fruit of carnage.
The "kissing bug" scare has so far worn oft in the
East that the boys and girls are organizing "kissing
bug trolley parties" to ride out into the suburbs on
moonlight nights in search of the beast; and accord
ing to reports in some of our most reliable contem
poraries they are the rage of the summer season.

CALIFORNIA FARMING.
THE Secretary of Agriculture has given a too j
brief examination to the rural industries of this j
State, and has announced therefrom some con- |
: elusions/ all of which are interesting, while some Sire
hasty.
His visit has been too brief to permit him to see
that our agriculture is a quite different art from that
of the hot summer and cold winter prairie States
â â  of the Mississippi Valley. The Secretary sees here
wheat fields that are seeded to that crop year after year
and, reasoning from the prairie-land standpoint,
! warns us of the exhaustion of the soil and prescribes ;
! a rotation of crops. On the prairies a farmer has all j
! the cereals including corn, that noblest of the grasses. j
i To rotate with them he has clover, red top and tim- I
! othy, turnips, potatoes. and carrots. A more exten-,
wye examination of the physical peculiarities of Call
| fornia would have shown the Secretary that over the
! most of our wheat region such rotation is impossible.- ;
j Timothy and red clover will not grow under the same
! conditions and in the same soil as wheat in this State.
! The same is true of the root crops. Our alfalfa fields
I are located where irrigation can be used, and that J
; crop is not possible in a system of rotation, because
j when once established the plant is" perennial and its.
' eradication is difficult as well as undesirable. Alfalfa
! and the rod crops, being mostly impossible on our j
i wheat lands, wheat is seldom ventured where they are {
i grown. Almost the only successors to wheat here j
! have been the orchard and vineyard. These have j
: crowded grain out of Napa. Vaca, Suisun and scores j
!of other valleys. Like wheat they flourish there umr
; rigated. But they are not rotated with wheat. They j
j become its permanent successors to the soil. They
I occupy a wider range and a greater variety of soils j
I and exposures than either wheat or the root crops.
Wheat is driven from the bottom lands and inter
vales and the great alluvial deposits like that of Cache |
! Creek and such rivers as the Salinas, and is grown j
: on the dry valley soils, rich in silicates and the mineral
elements derived from disintegration of the rocks,
j Its quality here depends upon the conditions found in ;
. such localities. It gets no rain after April, grows,
I blooms, ripens and dries so thoroughly that it is cut
! and threshed in one operation and is ready for the null
jan hour alter it felt the sickle in the field. Of course,
: it exhausts the soil.
The Secretary might have remained long enough
! to look in vain for the strawstack and manure pile
jon our wheat ranches. These means of fertilizing are j
| but little used and the neglect of them is wrong. The j
: waste of fertilizers produced on the ranches here is I
! the dissipation of what should take the place of an im
possible rotation of crops in our wheat region. It is
: true that the dry season. is unfavorable to the [mine
; diate assimilation of the plant food that would go back
, with the straw and manure, but it remain* in the soil I
i to yield its food under the influence of the rainy
season. *
But this neglected substitute for an impossible rota
tion is not the only recourse of the California wheat
rancher. He is perfectly well aware of the exhausting
quality of wheat. He has seen land fall from thirty
sacks per acre to ten and five, and he knew the rea
son-before the Agricultural Department was estab
lished. To rest and recruit the soil the California
wheat rancher has gone back to an agricultural bulle
tin issued by the first Secretary of that art known in
history. He lets his land lie fallow according to the
advice of Moses to the Israelites, who were raising
wheat under physical conditions almost identical with
those of California.
Rotation of crops is properly practiced when pos
sible to avoid loss of the use of the land. Summer
fallowing as practiced by the wheat ranchers of Cali
fornia is chemically and economically its substitute.
It restores the soil and on one year's rest it produces
the crops of two years. It is not practiced in the East,
though it might be used with good effect on the thin
soils of the clay hills in the prairie States. There fail
plowing is practiced to get the effect of frost to make
stiff soils more friable, but the land is cropped an-
nually.
Finally, it is worthy of note that the sugar beet is
promising a rotation with wheat that is not offered by
any other crop. The Secretary has pointed out that
the Past and West Indies can produce cane sugar one
and a quarter cents a pound cheaper than we can pro
duce beet sugar. The margin is the difference between
free labor here and servile labor there. We want the
sugar beet as an addition to our crops and valuable
for rotation, and we want the land and labor which
produce it protected against the tropica - soil and
servile labor of all the Indies.
Police Judge Treadwell has a chance of which he
seems to evince a commendable disposition to avail
himself. It is plain that Lawyer Isaac Thorne and
Mrs. Carroll, after having accused "Brick" McPher
son and his gang of swindlers, are now preparing to
drop the prosecution. In some way or other their
demands have been satisfied and they are selfish
enough to allow the arch conspirator and his minions
to go free to prey again upon the public. It remains
with Judge Treadwell to see that the prosecution
proceeds.
OUR HOME-COMING VOLUNTEERS.
I"~Â»IFTY thousand dollars is the sum asked for by
- the committee intrusted with the task of pre
paring the reception for our home-coming vol
unteers, and there are now fair assurances it will be
duly forthcoming. Many liberal subscriptions have
been already sent in and others have, been promised
that can be counted on.
It is to be borne n. mind the reception is to be
something more than a holiday of parades and festi
vals, though these will be stately and impressive. It
is the intention of the committee to arrange for the
boys to resume work in their former places of em
ployment as far as that can be done, and where it is
impracticable, to provide other but equally satisfac
tory positions for them. The .volunteers are in fact
to be welcomed home in the fullest sense of the word,
and are to find that welcome not only in the social
nut in the industrial circles where they are known and
honored.
Every citizen should find pleasure and pride in con
i tributing to the fund needed for these purposes. The
volunteers of California were the first to enlist for the
I war. While in other States there was some delay and
' no little wrangling over the legal problems involved
| in the transfer of whole regiments 01 men from the
National Guard to the United States Volunteer serv
ice, the Californians responded at once and left it to
the authorities to' settle the law problems later. Thus
our boys have the honor of being first to enlist, and
j are among the latest to return home. Such distinction
i of service entitles them to a distinction of honor, and
! the welcome accorded them should be of a character
| to attract the attention of the nation and attest the
1 pride of California in her heroes.
The reception committee has at every step of its
I work shown a genuine appreciation of what is- re
; quired. The members have been earnest, patriotic
| and energetic in their labors. They have not spared
J themselves. They have planned the welcome on broad
Tines and set themselves resolutely to accomplish it.
THIS gfA-JS-r FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 6. 1899.
To such leaders the business men, the property own
ers, the public spirited citizens of San Francisco owe
a cordial support. Let all unite in the movement.
1 Make the contributions liberal and prompt. Let Cali
fornia's welcome to her volunteers stand as an ex
ample for the emulation of her sister States and for
future generations.
Since the sudden leaping into fame of Poet Mark
ham his well beloved county of Alameda, has been

THE DUTY OF GOOD CITIZENS.
ON this day of rest from the absorbing pursuits
of work, it will be well for the business men,
the taxpayers, the intelligent workingmen, the
good citizens of San Francisco, to give heed to the j
issues involved in the approaching municipal election. \
The primaries will take place on Tuesday. In the ,
Democratic party there is a faction fight between <
Buckley on one side and Rainey and the Examiner
on the other, so there is no hope* for the independent' j
voter in that quarter. In the Republican primaries. !
however, there is an easy way for the taxpayers to :
win a triumph which will provide San Francisco with j
a good administration.
The strategic point of the municipal contest is the I
Republican convention. If that body be controlled j
by sterling citizens all will be well. A strong, clean |
ticket will be nominated, and a string clean County
Committee appointed to conduct the canvass. Suc
cess at the polls on election day will be well nigh as
sured, and every prospect of the city will brighten.
Good men, free from pledges to the bosses, can ob
tain control of the convention only by the support of
good citizens at the primaries. If the property owners
and the taxpayers stay away from the polling booths :
en Tuesday the bosses and their gangs will have their j
own way. Who. then, will be to blame if the Republi- j
ran convention fail to nominate a ticket which the
best people can support? ""*;'-!â¢
Every duty in life carries with it a reward for those |
who arc true to it and a penalty for those who are
false. If the taxpayers be true to their political duties ;
they will have their reward in a municipal administra- j
tion which will advance their welfare and lighten their j
taxes. If they be false to those duties they will have
to pay the penalty by submission to bad government !
and heavy taxes. _ I
The issue cannot be evaded. The primaries will j
occur on Tuesday. The bosses and the taxeaters have
already marshaled their gangs and are ready to fight I
for the spoils. Shall the taxpayers fight for good gov- j
ernment or surrender without a struggle' That is the
question every intelligent voter should ask himself
to-day.
Senator Sammy Braunhart says his visit to Herrin
had nothing to do with Democratic politics. He
might induce the people to believe that he was trying
to sell the head of the Southern Pacific law depart
ment something in the shape of a "pucky rope."
BUCKLEY AND MIS WICKED PARTNER.
ONE of Bret Harte's best known stories tells
how two men who had long been "pards" in
the mines fell out at last and became enemies.
One of them, an ambitious, brainy fellow, announced
himself as a candidate for the. Legislature, whereupon
the other one, out of sheer antagonism and deviltry,
declared himself an opposition candidate. The "boys"
of the camp insisted upon a j.oint debate, and the rivals
were brought to the meeting.
The first fellow proved himself something of a nat
ural born orator, a master of the fierce invective of the
border, so when he opened the floodgates of his
wrathful words upon his opponent the camp felt it
was getting its moneys worth and wondered why the
other fellow didn't shoot. No one expected him to be
able to reply to the charges made against him, and
shooting seemed the only thing for him to do. When
it came his turn to speak he made no attempt at ora
tory* "Boys," said he, "this man has said many mean
things about me, but he has not said the worst. I
must confess to a lower depravity than anything he
has charged upon me. I have reformed now and I
am going to do better, but I must acknowledge to you
that for ten years I was that man's partner."
That old story of the mining camps of the early days
has its parallel in the reply of Buckley to the pages
of vituperation poured out upon him by the Exam
iner. Buckley claims to have reformed, but he ad
mits that for years he was the Examiner's partner.
He aided the Examiner with money, with w-ork and
with council. He assisted its former proprietor in
contests for the Governorship and the Senatorship,
he assisted its managing editor to become a member
of the Legislature. He knew of its deals with the
railroad and with parties working corrupt jobs with
Supervisors, and he did not expose them. Now that
the Examiner assails him as boodler, looter, robber,
thief, unconvicted criminal, and forty other vile
things, he bows himself and acknowledges a lower
depravity still. He was for years the partner of that
gang.
According to his showing there were some schemes
of the Examiner in which Buckley, even while train
ing with the yellow journal, would have no share.
"They say I am in the employ of Huntington," he ex
claims with indignation. "That's a lie! I am not in
the employ of Mr. Huntington and have never been.
But it is well known to every resident of this com
munity that a short time ago the Examiner was in the
employ of Mr. Huntington, under a contract of one
thousand dollars a month for thirty months. And 1
want to say right here that that is not the only time
to my knowledge that the Examiner sold out to Mr.
Huntington."
; Referring to the indictment against him by the Wal
lace Grand Jury with respect to the franchise obtained
I by Mayne, and which constituted a great scandal at
; the time, Buckley asserts he had nothing to do with
it. he refused to sanction the scheme and advised his
â  friends among the Supervisors to reject it; and he
i adds: / r
j "Had they indicted the Examiner or the people who
I were running it they would have been pretty near cor
! tect. Mr. Mayne afterward informed me that he had
i a contract with that paper for printing and advertising
l for $12. .00 and a part of that contract called for the
j Examiner's aid in the passage of the franchise and
1 having the Mayor sign it. To corroborate my state
ment I refer you to the editorials of the paper about
j that time."
These are but samples of what Buckley has to tell
of the doings of his wicked partner. Why is the Ex
aminer so- suddenly silent on the issue? Why has it
dropped the subject with a dull thud? Why does it
turn all its rages against Otis thousands of miles away
and leave a fight it took up so hotly scarcely more
than a week ago?
Some people say Porto Rico is going to be a rich
and profitable addition to our country, but we note
there is already a call from the island for charitable
contributions to feed the poor.
THE SHAMROCK.

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfIUGHT.
Boston brains are buzzing like so
many buzz saws over the very
pertinent question: "Where does the
devil spend the summer?" It is con
ceded by all that he spends it among
his friends, but there is a radical and
somewhat heated difference of opinion
as to whether his friends are found in
the city or at the summer resorts.
Of course such a question would not
give rise to any earnest discussion here.
The Californian devil may be at Santa
Cruz, Shasta or somewhere in Amador,
but we know he is not in San Fran
cisco, and therefore it would be im
possible for even the most disputatious
man to raise an argument on the issue.
Nevertheless, as a matter of leisure
day amusement it will be worth while
to take a look at the subject from a
Boston standpoint. A Boston view is
nearly always worth having; and be
sides, to talk of the devil is such* a
variation from municipal politics that
even if considered as a novelty merely,
It will be found of interest to all moral
ists and summer resort people.
One Bostonian. who evidently believes
duty and work to be the supreme things
in life, maintains the devil goes to the
mountains and the seashore as soon as
the summer season opens. He says:
"Of course, Satan lurks about the
hours of idleness, the hours of absence
from ordinary associations and re
straints, the hours of vacation abandon,
to tempt to every form of evil, to all
pride, and selfishness and self-indul
gence."
Another of the same creed, and pos
sibly of the same complexion, but of a
livelier disposition and more pictur
esque" style, jumps into the controversy
with the exclamation:
"One moment, if you please, while I
telephone an order to hell for my win
ter's stock of fuel. Now, then, friends,
what can I do' for you? An excursion
to hades! Well, come on. Start at
Paradise, take the man and the woman
briefly stopping there; go by way of
the modern parks, the mountains, the
harbors, the beaches and the sea. On,
now, with 'seven-leagued boots' to hell
and return."
In that outburst are three statements
which may be regarded as among the
most interesting news items of the day.
One is the announcement of the exist
ence of telephone communication be
tween Boston and hell, another that it
is practicable in that city to obtain
fuel from hades and the third that one
may go to hell and then return to
Boston. It is true that no one haying
gone to hell has ever been known to
return to Boston, but that is not sur
prising when you come to think of it.
The arguments of those who maintain
that the devil spends his summer in the
city are weak even as the theory is
weak. He is but a sentimentalist who
believes Satan would stay in town with
the workers when he could go to the
summer resorts where the flirters are,
and accordingly the arguments of such
a man run naturally to sentiment.
One of these says: "The devilâ to
adopt that convenient dramatic figure
âis a specialist in the emotions. The
bounding life which humanity enjoys,
in common with all nature, during the
season from seed-time to harvest
affords him a very particular oppor
tunity, provided he can get the condi
tions which he desires. The desired
conditions are supplied on a very large
scale by the narrow streets, ugly brick
walls, dust and aggravating strips of
dull-colored sky, which go to make up
the city landscape. During the winter
it may be endured. During the sum
mer it is impossible."
Another advocate on that side de
clares there is at every summer resort
something which overcomes the devil
so that he cannot stay there and has
to return to town. He says:
"Nature is the eternal in'spirer of
curiosity and the prime source of
healthy mental growth. Nature calls
forth unrepressed sentiment. Nature
removes discouragement, which is only
'disenchanted egotism'; and by its
reach, its power, its perfection, supplies
a new perspective, which makes and
keeps a large-hearted way of life easier
than it was before."
Thus stands the dispute. It will be
noted with something of surprise that
not a single disputant in Boston thinks
it worth while to raise the question
whether there be a devil or not.

Painters and sculptors have so fre
quently and so emphatically denounced
the masculine garb of our time as an
abomination incapable of artistic treat
ment it is interesting to learn from the
high authority of expert tailors that
these complaining folks are talking of
something they know nothing about,
and the pictures they paint of the gar
ments of the time are but caricatures
of the really attractive dress tailors
make for men.
The critic of the London Art Fashion
Journal has reviewed with care the por
traits exhibited this year at the Royal
Academy, and in his heart he mourns
over what he saw there. "The tailor,"
he says, "has to study how he can in
troduce effect into the costume of his
customer in such a way as to empha
size the points of beauty and hide any
features of ugliness that may exist.
In the majority of the portraits to be
seen on the walls of Burlington House
on this occasion we feel that as tailors
we have been grossly libeled. There
is a lack of harmony in the outline, a
disregard of seams, an irregular place
ment of buttons, and a use of | orna
mentation which is altogether: gro
tfcsone. We should be very sorry to
think that any of these portraits are to
be handed down to posterity as a rep
resentation of nineteenth century tail
oring skill."
From that statement we may learn
at least there are two sides to the ques
tion of the relation of modern clothing
to art. Certainly until artists have
learned how to copy a coat properly,
they have no right to declare the gar
ment incapable of artistic treatment.
When a tailor by his skill has con
cealed the defects of the masculine
form and made a man look presentable,
it is|plearly libelous and unjust for a
paindlr or a sculptor to rise and remark
the dress itself is ugly.
It is one of the gayest and also one
of the grimmest humors of the time
that the jingo press, which but a little
while ago were clamoring to all the
powers that be for a censorship of the
mails to prevent the sending of un
censored news from this country to
Manila, are now making an equal
amount of noise because a censorship
at Manila prevents the sending of news
to this country. They denounce as a
military outrage in the Philippines the
very policy they insisted upon inflict
ing upon all of us at home. The old
conundrum "What makes more noise
than a pig under a fence" has been
answered at last. It is jingo journal
ism with its foot in its mouth, bawling
because it can't swear.
There are now visible in this country
signs and symptoms of a worse censor
ship than any we need fear from either
Major Generals or Postmasters General.
It is the censorship which by a slow
but steady movement is being extended
over ' the universities of the country.
We have not felt -it in California, but
in the East it has shown its baneful
power from New England to Kansas.
When the trustees of Brown Univer
sity demanded that President Andrews
be silent on financial problems, a storm
burst forth that forced the trustees to
yield the point for a time. They re
coiled, but they did not retreat; and
in the end Andrews had to leave. Since
that occurrence' there have been many
similar happenings In various univer
sities, but the public seems to have
lost Interest in the subject. There are
no more universal protests, and the
censors are steadily gaining an ascend
ency that threatens to render free
thought and free speech well nigh im
possible in a university career.
Outside theological seminaries, where
dogma is frankly and rightfully made
the foundation of all teaching, Chicago
University is the seat of the most dog
matic censorship ever established over
intellectual freedom in the United
States since the days when Puritanism
died out because it> was too hide-bound
to grow. The secretary of the univer
sity recently sent to all members of
the faculty this warning:
"While it is the privilege of every
member of the university to entertain
whatsoever opinion he may choose con
cerning controverted questions of pub
lic interest and to express that opinion
in any proper way and on any proper
occasion, it is nevertheless desirable
that great care should be taken to
avoid involving the university, even by
remote implication, in such contro
verted matters; that all actions and ex
pressions of opinion on such subjects
should be scrupulously dissociated from
all university relations so far as pos
sible; that by such scrupulous regard
for the good standing of the university
in the opinion of all classes real free
dom of speech and action will be pro
moted."
Such a letter following so closely
after the dismissal of Professor Bemis
from the university has not unnatur
ally given rise to a good deal of agita
tion among university men who deal
with economic problems. There Is hardly
a department of economics that is not
now more or less subject to political
discussion, and if professors are to ab
stain from taking sides on controverted
issues of economics.it' will not be easy
for them to talk at all. It is then not
surprising that the letter of Goodspeed
has caused a flutter in university cir
cles. The surprising thing is that the
public treats the whole affair as a
matter of course, and seems to regard
the issue as a part of the private busi
ness of President Harper and Mr.
Rockefeller.
Were Chicago University the only
seat of liberal, learning where a censor
ship has been put into operation, the
issue might indeed be passed over as a
matter of comparatively little moment.
We cannot in reason expect Mr. Rocke
feller to be much more liberal in schol
arship than in the oil business. Unfor
tunately the censorship practice is very
attractive to trustees, and accordingly
it has been tried of late in more places
than one. A professor from the Uni
versity of Syracuse, in New York, and
another from the Agricultural College,
in Kansas, have been disciplined for
taking of economic prospects certain
views which the trustees couldn't see.
That these dismissals have followed
one another so rapidly and so shortly
after the outburst of popular indigna
tion over the attempt to discipline
Andrews is a proof that the evil is a
growing one and will bear watching.
Since in these days it is the' custom
to denounce politicians and laud the
business man, it is worth nothing in
this connection that in State universi
ties where the trustees are appointed,
by Governors, and where their selection
is largely determined by political con
siderations, there have been almost no
evidences of an attempt at a censor
shin. Public oninion keens close euard
on such Institutions, and a censorship
over a State university would raise a
storm indeed. It is only in universities
where trustees are not responsible to
public opinion that the censor feels his
oats and cavorts like a wild ass in the
desert, or an Otis at Manila,

CITY WHOLESALERS

COUNTRY BUYERS TO RECEIVE
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION.
Big Rebates Made on Transportation,

When They Purchase

The Manufacturers' and Wholesalers'
League of San Francisco has recently
started out to make a bid for much of the
country trade which in the past has been
going to the East. For years past the
local business men have been watching
the trade of the coast slip out of their
hands, while the persistent drummer of
Eastern houses has been laughing in his
sleeve as he pocketed the profits which
BhotlW have been kept on the coast. Last
year the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association adopted a system in vogue in
the East of standing a part of the cost of
transportation of the country dealers who
would come to this city ami make their
purchases here. It was a success, but not
enough of a success to suit.
In order to make the system more far
reaching other commercial bodies were
called into the project and a recent meet
ing resulted In the formation of the
league. The officers elected consisted of
the. following: President, A. A. Watkins
of W. W. Montague & Co.; secretary.
Eugene Goodwin, Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association; executive com
mitteeâA. Watkins .(chairman), Levi

The merchants lost no time, but went :
among their number and in a short time
a membership of 175 appeared upon their j
roll, only the wholesale merchants and

from the reduction on railroad fares fori
the country merchant and his family, he]
will receive reductions from several of the

OTTO TUM SUDEN'S DISCOVERY.
Declares the Board of Health Has No
Authority to Operate Receiv
ing Hospital.
A long communication from Attorney
Otto turn Suden was filed with the clerk
of the Board of Supervisors yesterday,
calling the attention of the board to he
alleged fact that the Board of Health has |
no authority under the law to operate and ;
maintain the City Receiving Hospital. The
writer declares t. at the only semblance
of such authority is contained in that sec
tion of the statutes that gives the Board of
Health the right to appoint a police sur
geon, "whose duty it shall be to make all
autopsies required by the Coroner." In
conclusion Mr. turn Suden urges the
Board of Supervisors to take the manage
ment of the hospital Into its own hands.
The attention of Dr. Lawlor was called I
to fhe communication and he was asked !
what he thought of it. He said: .
"We have never claimed any authority j
to operate the city Receiving Hospital, I
but we do claim the right to order it :
closed, as was done, because of its unsan
itary condition. This whole building ought j
to be closed, for that matter. The sewer- |
age here is a disgrace to civilization."
Supervisor Perrault declined to discuss !
the subject at length, simply saying that
If the Board of Health had usurped any
authority in connection with the operation
of the Receiving Hospital the usurpation .
was retry sensible and convenient, and
probably* would not be interfered with by
the Board of Supervisors.

A Victory for the Butchers.
A meeting of representatives of the ,

j Lawlor, Market Inspector dans, Officer '
i Butterworth and Veterinary Surgeon \
i O'Rourke was held in the rooms of the i
| Board of Health yesterday to discuss the !
j question of whether President Alpers of I
* the National Fertilizing Works had au- |
I thority to remove the carcasses of con- ;
j demned animals notwithstanding the pro- '
i tests of the butchers. It was decided that :
; the butchers could dispose of the car- ;
: casses as they saw fit providing they did
so within twelve hours after death, after ;
: which time Alpers has authority to re- j
move them. This will enable the butchers j
I to sell the carcasses to fertilizing works.

The transport Deelanaw arrived from

Filipinos for the Mechanics' Fair. There

necessary to establish a native village at
the fair. They will also give a circus per
formance, and have brought along three
of the famous water -buffaloes, several
small ponies, some trained dogs and mon
keys, snakes, lizards and some of the fa
mous lighting chickens of the Philippines.
The snakes, lizards and chickens are for
exhibition purposes only; the water buf
faloes, horses, dogs and monkeys will all
be used in the circus.
Of the band of Filipinos thirty-six are
! circus performers. While these are giv
ing an exhibition the others will remain
!at home and take care of the village. Of
i the circus performers seven are women,
' and none of them are handsome. The
j men are small and smart-looking. They
. were all dressed in white, while the
women had donned all the colors of the
I rainbow, for the occasion. There are a
I number of children in the band, and one
more than when the transport left Manila.
When the Leelanaw was about a week out
one of the women gave birth to a little
Bon, and there was great rejoicing among
the Filipinos in consequence. It means,
! they say, that they will have good luck
, all the time they arc away from home.
The crew of the Leelanaw are very
chary about going into the hold of the
, steamer. One of the snakes, a species of
' boa Constrictor, made his escape from his
; cage and is now secreted somewhere
i about the lower portion of the transport.
Several searcning parties have been or
ganized, but none of them were able to
locate his snakeship. and the latter will
not come forth, as he probably gets all
i he wants to eat in the shape of rats in the
hold. The water buffaloes and horses
stood the long journey well. They are a
little bit short in flesh, hut will doubtless
pick up after they get ashore.
The immigration officer has the cases of
j all the Filipinos now under consideration,
and the chances are the party will be
1 landed on Monday. They will be taken
at once to the Mechanics' Pavilion, where
quarters' have been fitted up for them.
; From now until the opening of the fair
; they will be engaged in building their
â  houses and getting their village in order
for the opening night. ; > .;
The Filipinos came up in charge of W.
B. Silver, who has been in the Philippines
since 1592. He went there from Cleveland,
0., to put in an electric light plant, and
has remained as superintendent until the
scheme to bring a band of Filipinos to San
Francisco was started. He got the men,
women and children together and has ac
companied them. Mr. Silver has brought
home with him a large quantity of relics
and curios from the Philippines, all of
which will be placed on exhibition at the
fair. â  -â -->?&"â  --.^\Ss m
'The Japanese steamer Hongkong Maru
arrived from â  the Orient last Friday
i night. She sailed from Honolulu six
| hours after the United States steamer
Badger. The latter vessel is coming along
: slowly, and it will probably be Monday
1 morning before she gets here. She has
' on board the German and United States
; Commissioners io Samoa, the .English
Commissioner having gone to New Zea
land to visit a sister. The Hongkong
i Maru brought up 31 cabin, 10 second cabin
and* 33 Japanese passengers. Owing to
the fact that bubonic plague is still rag
ing in China all applications for passage
jby Chinese were refused. The vessel was
j rigidly inspected by the quarantine offi
! cer and was not allowed to land until
â  yesterday afternoon.
The Mail Company's steamer City of
Peking departed for the Orient yester
! day. On the last trip she was quarantined
j at Nagasaki and delayed at Honolulu, so
she Is . now nearly a week behind time.
The Peking was to have docked here, but
: owing to her being so much behind it was
decided to send her on and dock her at
Hongkong. She .will probably get oack to ,
I San Francisco on schedule time. The ,
Peking took away a light passenger list !
; and a fair cargo. Among those in the ,
cabin were H. S. Crocker, who will make i
a tour of the world, returning to San
Francisco in October. Mrs. J. Sloat Fas
sett and her sons and daughters will be
passengers on the Peking as far as Hono
lulu, where they will meet the Senator
: and return to San Franciscj with him.
Senator Fassett is now in Hawaii, having
gone there via China and Japan.
The ship Standard will be towed to the
\ Columbia River to be loaded for Ade- .
, laide, Australia. From there she will go -
! to Newcastle. N. S. W., and load coal for
j Honolulu, and from the latter port will
' bring a load of sugar to San Francisco. .
I Captain Backus, late master of the Ed- \
ward May, will command the Standard.
Captain Leale got greater speed out of
j the steamer Caroline yesterday than at j
i any other time since her new boilers were
I put in. He was on his way from the :
j steamer Hongkong Maru to the quaran
tine station with the steerage passengers
! of the mail boat, when he noticed the
i flag on .the quarantine hulk was flying \
I union down. Leale at once came to the !
conclusion that something terrible had j
happened to the keeper or his wife, so he
ordered the engineer to give the Caroline
all the steam she could carry and the run
to the old Omaha was made in quick
time. [ â â -'â i.y- .'â¢ -" -
"Why, what's the matter?" asked the
keeper, poking his head over the side.
"What's the matter yourself?" queried
Captain Leale, in his turn. "Why are you
living your flag union down?"
The keeper cast his weather eye aloft
and said. "Well, I'm ! I was busy this
morning, and I asked the old woman to
hoist the flag, and she's run it up upside
down. The laugh's on me, captain. Good

THE COUNTERFEITERS.
More Molds Found and Clews That
Will Turn Up the Rest of
the Gang.
! Secret Service Agent Hazen and Op
erator Cronin made a second search yes
terday morning of the premises recently
occupied by Karl Kristensen. the coun
terfeiter, and his mistress, Mrs. Mary
Terry, alias Mrs. Kristensen, alias Nellie
Brown, and discovered several plaster j
molds and other tools used in the manu
facture of -counterfeit coins. The molds !
showed that they' had been made with
skillful hands and not by a novice, as
Kristensen pretended to be.
Mr. Hazen has secured evidence show
ing that Kristensen and his pals had
been engaged in the business of counter
feiting for the past four months. Every
effort is being made to apprehend the
rest of the gang, and it is expected that
within a few days they, will be behind the
bars in the County Jail.
The prisoners were taken before United
States Court Commissioner Manley yes-*
terday, and the date of their examination
was hxpd for next Tuesday morning at
10 o'clock. Bail was fixed at $1000 each,
in default of which the loving couple were
taken back to the County Jail.
While waiting in the Marshal's office
the woman said that she intended to com
mit suicide at the first opportunity.
A USEFUL INVENTION.
An invention of unusual practicability
has recently been granted William E,.
Shaw of 1621 Market street, this city,
which promises to revolutionize the pres
ent methods of shoeing horses.
The invention consists of a steel spring
dovetailed into the toe of the shoe that
extends backward slightly beyond the
heels. At the end of the spring is a cup,
also dovetailed Into the spring, which is
filled with hard rubber and so molded
that its removal becomes impossible.
Either the spring or its attached cup can
be instantly removed by slight pressure
and without removing the shoe.
It is manifest that the shod hoof strikes
the ground first at the heel, or at the
point of the spring where the rubber cup
is located, which by virtue of its yielding
nature, combined with the spring, pre
vents any sudden concussion to the ani
mal and gradually lets the hoof down,
as the weight of the animal overcomes
the force of the spring and causes it
to occupy approximately the same plane
as that of the shoe. A horse shod with
this shoe is therefore equipped to main
tain a firm footing upon the steepest or
smoothest surfaces. It also prevents the
many diseases of legs and hoofs that
horses employed upon the unyielding sur
faces of city pavements are subject to,
and corrects the gaits of horses that do
not travel as they should. Mr. Shaw has
many testimonials from the leading
horsemen of this city who have made
practical tests of his shoe, among which
may be mentioned the following:
"Seeing a model of Mr. W. E. Shaw's
spring horseshoe It struck me as some
thing wonderful. I had my gray gelding
shod with a pair. He had begun to show
signs of contraction and was knee
sprung. After two weeks his feet have
spread three-quarters of an inch and
never slip even on a wet cable slot. His
knees are firm and hard, proving the ben
efit derived from the shoes. Most im
portant of all. his gait is springy and
beautiful. I can truthfully say this is the
king of all shoes.

FORCING WELLS,
FARGO & CO. TO
OBEY THE LAW
Revenue Tax Case to
Be Tried.
DISCRIMINATION IS SHOWN
ATTORNEY GENERAL FORD'S
INACTION.
He Declines to Prosecute the Com
pany for Palpably Violating the
Law Under Which It Holds
Its Charter.
After months of delay, which the
authorities are unwilling or unable to
explain, the suit to decide whether or
not Wells, Fargo & Co. shall obey the
revenue laws, without inflicting upon
the general public an injustice, is to be
tried in the State courts. Wells, Fargo
& Co. have compelled its patrons to pay
the war tax and by a system of in
justice and discrimination have forced
the public to pay the tax the burden
of which it should, under the law, sus
tain. The company has deliberately re
pudiated responsibility in the matter
and has refused to accept business
from people that declined to pay what
the law declared the company should
undertake.
In several parts of the State shippers
refused to pay the war tax. and Wells,
Fargo & Co. declined to accept the
packages that were offered for delivery.
After a great deal of discussion the
controversy was brought into the
courts to determine whether Wells,
Fargo & Co, or the public should bear
directly the burden imposed by the
national Government. The suit was
instituted in the Federal courts and
after a great deal of needless delay was
transferred to the State courts, where
it properly belongs.
The responsibility of determining the
issue rests upon the shoulders of At
torney General Tirey L. Ford. For
some reason that the Attorney General
probably understands the suit has been
permitted to drag along without a con
clusion. No effort has been made to
force the important question to an
issue, and the Attorney General Is so
thoroughly interested in the matter
that he does not even know in which
department of the Superior Court the
case is to be tried. He is convinced,
however, or at least he says he is. that
when the case is tried the court will
decide that Wells, Fargo & Co. and not
the public must bear the burden of the
tax imposed by the Federal Govern
ment.
The case will be heard on the 18th of
this month and the court will then de
cide whether or not Wells, Fargo & Co.
must bear the tax. Since the contro
versy began this corporation has shown
the most flagrant discrimination In
favor of certain of its patrons and
against certain others. While the com
pany has exacted the revenue tariff
from some of its patrons it has released
others from all payment. This is prob
ably a discrimination which subjects
Wells, Fargo & Co., under the law, to
a forfeiture of its charter to transact
business within the jurisdiction of the
State. It is a matter of general knowl
edge that the company does not In cer
tain instances demand the revenue
tariff. 'â â 
This fact can be proved without diffi
culty, but the Attorney General does
not want to know it and says he can
not see how he can institute suit to
force the company to be just to the
public or forfeit the charter which lt
has no right to enjoy. The Attorney
General promises, however, to prose
cute vigorously the suit which has al
ready been instituted.

jured them in their business to the ex
tent of $50,000 by supplying them with a
poor quality of paint, whereby the de
fendants lost customers and were injured
in their good reputation as paint dealers.
The allegation Is made that they ordered
paint of Coit & Co. to be made of a cer
tain specified quality and according to a
certain formula, but Colt & Co. did not
make or furnish the paint called for, but
an Inferior article.

THE DEFENDER
BADLY DEFEATS
THE VIGILANT
Sails Away From Her
Old Rival.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEWPORT. R. 1.. Aug. s.â The Defender
met the Vigilant to-day for the first time
since the trial races four years ago. and
not only showed her superiority again but
gave her the worst beating in the history
of these two cup defenders. The Xavahoe
was in the race, but she in turn was
beaten by the Vigilant almost as much as
the latter was beaten by the Defender.
Tin Defender's showing to-day makes
the outlook for the Columbia very bright.
The Columbia hns already demonstrated
that she is far superior to the Defender.
The Columbia under tow passed all three
boats on her way to New London, so that
the yachtsmen did not have a chance to
see how much she could have beaten the
other Herrfshc-.Y sloops- Off ; lack island
the Columbia cast eft from her tender and
headed westward under her own canvas.
The Defender practically had a sailover.
for she defeated the Vigilant 17 minutes
4" seconds and the Xavahoe 22 minutes 50'
seconds in the windward work, boat for
boat. sii-- increased her lead over the
Vigilant up t<> 25 minutes in an eighteen
mile run before the wind; bearing her over [
3<i minute-- in all over a thirty-eight-mile
course.

ELEVEN INNINGS
AND THE DUDES
ARE VICTORIOUS
Fine Bali Played by
Taii-Enders.
Oakland 3, Watsonville 2.
Eleven Innings of good ball played by
the tail-enders filled the chests of the
few who attended yesterday's game with
an occasional thrill of genuine baseball
rapture.
The crowd was a negative quantity, but
the quality of ball was of the best.
Farmers and Dudes mingled In fast
play for two innings more than regulation
limits, but they were necessary to de
cide the game. Errors were few and hits
not very plentiful, although the Dudes
succeeded in accomplishing something
with the stick. The long, lugubrious and
melancholic smile of Cal Ewing has dis
appeared, and he is now ordering meals
from the Farmers. It was his first real
victory in several weeks, unmarred by
bold, bad umpires.
From the fifth inning to the eleventh
not a single run was scored. The Hay
seeds starti d the game with a single run, j
but the Brummehan wakes crawled up
in the . second to an even stand. In the
fourth Oakland scored a second run and
the score was tied in the fifth by Wat
sonville. Krom thai time on the game j
was carefully played, splendid fielding, :
good pitching and excellent base throw
ing being noticeable features.
The best inning of the game was the
tenth. After a painful and Mingy decfs-H
inn of O'Connell it looked like Watsonville
every second, but something happened to
Courtney, who strayed from the second
bag. and he was made an outcast by
a i lever throw of Hammond to Scbjneer.
The bases were filled and two men lay
under the sod. McCarthy ornamented
third base, Courtney was playing near
-. . md and Croll stood upon the first
pedestal like Patience waiting for pyro
technic divertisement. it did not come,
for just as Courtney left his base to be
ready for any old thing Hammond, who
had caught a pitched ball, took the chance
of his life and bolted the spheroid down
to second. Courtney died and the Farm
ers shed hayseeds as they went to the
bench, where manage gloom prevailed.
In reality the visitors from Watsonville
were retired when Croll was allowed first
base. He hit to Hardie, who fielded the
ball beautifully. throwing ("roll out. J
O'Connell had his eyes fastened upon Mc-
Carthy, who was making for third, and
didn't see the play at first. Of course
there was a kick, but as Cat Ewing had
Warned Lange not to spout objections, but
play ball, the king of the Dudes said lit- j
tle for fear of a fine. Subsequent events
retired the Farmers without a run, but
they held the winning card and missed
the chance.
The end of the eleventh inning saw the
coup de grace. Schmeer died with a sky
scratcher to McCarthy. Donovan reached
first after a short hit to McCarthy, beat
ing the ball by a pretty slide. He stole
second, made the third bag on Moski
man's single to right. Peeples cantered
to first on four balls and the bags were
crowded. Then up walked Hammond

At the end of the first mile Kikes led by
a yard, but Linton caught him and passed
the tape first at the second mile. Pierce
then went ahead, but Linton again took
with a lucky stick. He hit a grounder to |
Selna, who put him out at first, but Don
ovan scored and the game was over.
In the tenth Moskiman relieved Stef- *

easy game from San Jose to-day. The
score, 4 to 2, hardly tells the story of
the game, as the locals were never in it

only to gallop to win, as the Bard pair
could nowhere get near him.
The upset of the day was in the second
race, where Stuart was one to three in th*
betting and finished absolutely last after

COACH MEET AT BLINGUM
WAS A BIG SUCCESS
Just two short of a dozen equipages
turned out yesterday at the annual coach
meet of the Country Club at Burlingame.
but from every other point than that of
numbers the affair was the rippingest suc
cess that has yet been set down in the
club's history. Incidentally It was the
swellest and best attended function that
has gathered the Blingumites together
this past year. The newest things that
have attached themselves to breaks and
tally-hos since the last meet were brought
out; the ladies, who were largely in the
majority, were exquisitely gowned, and,
for that matter, so were the men.
The guests arrived for luncheon, which
was set on the gayly decorated veranda
of the clubhouse, and two hours of in
formality, music and good viands pre
ceded the forming of the parade. Walter
Hobart's handsome coach, with its owner
driving, led off for the San Mateo boule
vard, and following him was Henry
Crocker's coach with Mr. Crocker and a
deckload of the ladies of his party who
are spending the summer at the club.
After Mr. Crocker came Charlie Baldwin
with another coach load. The George
Popes followed and after them Joe Grant
and Dick Tobin in their breaks. Peter
Martin, who had been scheduled to leave
again for the south and the gold mine he
has recently discovered on his San Diego
ranch, stayed over just long enough to
toole the club coach out with his usual
jolly party. The Frank Carolans in their
break and the Baylard's coach would
have ended the line had it not been for
Prince Poniatowski's unique turnout.
The Poniatowskis have been promising
something startling for some weeks past;
they furnished it yesterday in the shape
of a swell drag drawn by four gray and
well-groomed mules, which, contrary to
the general rule, were quite capable of
setting the pace for the rest of the pro
cession. . â¢ -
The route was from the clubhouse out
to the San Mateo road, into the village
and back to the polo grounds. It was a
regal procession and all San Mateo turned
out to see it pass and then most of San
Mateo got -on its bicycle and made for
the polo field, where it crowded the grand
stand and all other available space save
the square in which the coaches lined up
fronting on the field.
The polo game was more fiercely con
tested and gave rise to more partisan
feeling than any of the games that have
made the "Bllngum" field famous. The
graduates of Georgetown College were
lined up against the club team and each
of the four periods that followed were
hotly fought. Walter Hobart. Dick Tobin.
Charlie Dunphy and John Lawson wore
the college red, and the blue of the club
was carried by Ollie and Joe Tobin, Tom
Driscoll and Peter Martin. The club team
won at the end of the fourth period with
a score of two goals to Georgetown's one.
Ate Poisoned Melon.
MARYSVILLE. Aug. s.â The lltttle
daughter of Mat Nelson has been serious
ly ill for several days with symptoms of
arsenical poisoning, which followed the
eating of a slice of watermelon. . It Is
thought a melon which was drugged for
squirrels .was brought to the market by
the grower by mistake.

persisted in giving him a bath, his sister

HIS AUDITORS
WERE CHARMED
BY HIS ORATORY
Rabbi Wise Delivers
an Able Address.
TEMPLE EMANUEL CROWDED
''âââ¦ââ
INITIAL DISCOURSE OF THE
LEARNED VISITOR.
He Logically Discusses a Biblical Sub
ject and Clothes It With Beau
tiful Imagery Excerpts *â 
From, thÂ« Sermon.
Stephen S. Wise, the brilliant young
rabbi of New York, charmed a large
congregation with his eloquence in the
Temple Emanu-El yesterday morning.
The initial public appearance in this
city of one of the leaders of the Zion
istic movement was the means of filling
the synagogue to its utmost capacity.
That his auditors were impressed with
his ability was evidenced by the rapt
attention they accorded him during the
delivery of the sermon. Dr. "Wise
stamped himself as an orator of
marked ability before he had half fin
ished his discourse. His melodious
voice, clear enunciation and dramatic
delivery added charm to the sermon,
which was noted for its strength and
simplicity. Whenever the speaker re
sorted to imagery he rounded out his
metaphors and similes with faultless
English.
The distinguished, visitor was intro
duced to the congregation by Rabbi
Voorsanger, who paid a high tribute to
his learning and told of the splendid
work he has already performed. Dr.
Wise then arose, and taking a position
at the reader's desk clasped his hands
and acknowledged the kind words of
his brother rabbi. At first his intona
tion was calm and deliberate, but as
he evolved his subject his delivery was
more impressive. He said:-
When first I .was bidden by Rabbi
Voorsanger to occupy the pulpit of
Emanu-El some Sabbath morning I felt
how vain it was to undertake to add to
the power, the eloquence and the learning
with which for more than a decade of
years your gifted minister has here
preached the word of God. Realizing as
I did that you had been disciplined in the
groundwork of the Jewish religion under
the leadership of Dr. Voorsanger, and
that consequently the message of life and i
[living as interpreted through Jewish
teaching had been .brought home to you In
masterfully luminous and. incisive fashion
by your beloved' minister, I nevertheless
felt that I must not forego the opportu
nity of bearing a greeting of fellowship
and brotherliness from the populous Jew
ish community of the great East to the
growing Jewish population of the greater
West. The old and ever new theme of Is
rael's aim and world mission is eloquent
of Inspiration, even to the faltering of
speech; aye. and added to the power
which comes, from communion with so
lofty a theme is the inspiration which must
needs rest upon whosoever has been privi
leged, as I have been for the first time,
to look upon the native beauty and
majesty of this golden Westâ God's coun
try in truth, most glorious of earth's
dwelling places. for the children of men.
The opening verse of this morning's
; scriptural lesson maps out for us a se
verely simple and direct programme of
life. "Behold." saith the Lord, -"I set before
i thee this day a blessing and 'a curse."
Choose ye. One recognizes herein forth
i with the characteristic and unfailing
quality of Jewish optimism. Coupled,
however, with this healthful optimism,
which posits good and blessing as before
and above evil and curse. is the sane and
wholesome recognition of evil and dark
ness as forces to be reckoned with â
though not unconquerableâ ln a world of
action and strife. This setting up of good
and blessing as first and foremost amid
the things of lifeâ by the side of which
I evil seems incidental and secondaryâ will
j remind you of that Illustrious and classic
i epoch at the beginning of the present era
1 when for many years the Jewish schools
j of instruction were rent asunder by the
! bitter discussion of. the problem, "Is life
I worth living?" "Nay," was the ultimate
j decision, but, as Zangwill happily pharses.
i it, the noble quality of Jewish optimism
j asserted itself for all time in the memor
able dictum,. "Even though life be not
i worth living we must live our life worth
! ily and well." When all this has been said
and allowing the aforementioned verse
to stand as an incontrovertible proof of
that full-blooded optimism which animat
ed and dominated the Jewish body poli
tic throughout all ages, the question ob
trudes Itself, Is life in truth made up of
two radically different, antagonistic and ;
irreconcilable elements? Are not good and
evil, blessing and curse, rather to be Im
agined like, unto light and darkness, with
their shades and shadows and the infin
ite gradations into which these dissolve
and blend? The sunshine is the life-giv
ing, Joy-imparting power in this blessed
fertile State. After a few months have
sped you will cast your eyes searchingly
and longingly to the skies for the rain
clouds, though these threaten to hide the
face el .the sun, rejoicing at last when the
rains begin to fall upon the ground and
nourish the soil whence all sustenance
cometh. Again, after a time, you will. wait
as eagerly for ' the sunshine to break
through the clouds and scatter these for
a season. Each ln its time and both to
gether form man's lasting happiness!
The question before us, I take it, is far
other than that. Time may have been
when blessing and curse were rigidly fixed
and absolute terms. As time went on (it
is almost a truism to observe) the condi
tions of life became more Intricate and
complex, and paralleling the ever-Increas
ing complexity of life's affairs, there has
come to be a corresponding complexity in
the meaning and the working out of terms
which once were absolute/ Do not misun- 'â 
derstand meâ that any doubt or inde
cision has arisen or ever can arise touch
ing the abyssmal gulf which separates good
from evil In the moral or ethical sense of
these terms. I simply hold that it Is Im
possible to predicate categorically that

any single condition or circumstance in
life is either a blessing or a curse. In
saving "Behold, I set before you this day
a blessing and a curse." the Biblical au
thor is bent upon making clear that it is
the will of God that all things in the
world are primarily designed for our bene
fit and blessing and that, moreover, curse
and evil befall us only when we choose to
have it so. In other words, blessing and
curse are two different elements of life
only in the sense that it is for us to de-
I termlne whether our life shall be mainly
laden with blessing or in any wise fraught
I with curse. In the light of this newly es
tablished principle we recognize it as our
nearest and holiest duty to take heed lest
1 that which is meant to bless become a
1 curse and a bane; and, finally, we must
so live and labor that even what seems
likeliest to bring about our undoing be
triumphantly wrought into blessing.
Recently i gazed with awe upon the
mightiest of the glaciers of Alaska. From
time to time a rumbling could be heard,

about to sail away, lo and behold, a col
ossal fragment began to quiver and. after
1 poising in the air for a moment, fell with
1 thundering crash into the waters. We felt
that the ship would be engulfed by" the
waves and that the whole glacier would
quickly crumble Into wreck and ruin. A
moment and all was quiet as before, the
glacier's beauty unmarred, its icy majesty
unchanged. "What mattered the falling
â¢ away of a fragment, for the glacier is a
veritable sea of Ice, miles wide, mountain
high and stretching back for many, many
miles, fed by countless rivers! Need I

PASSED STATE BOARD.
Dental Examiners Conclude Their
Labors With a Banquet and
Elect Officers;
The California State Board of Dental
Examiners has finished its lour days' ses
sion which it has been holding at the Col
lege of Physicians and Surgeons. Out of
thirty-six applicants who presented them
selves for examination in theoretical and
practical dentistry only eight succeeded
in getting the necessary number of cred
its which will permit them to practice
the profession In this State. This shows
the rigorous character of the examina
tions, as the members of the board are
determined that no one shall be given a
license unless he Is fully qualified.
The following were the successful appli
cants: J. W. Johnson. A. E. Sykes. M.

Last night the members of the board
gave a delightful banquet at a downtown
rotisserie. Dr. Thomas Morffew, former
president, was the guest of honor, and
replied to the toast, "The Dental Board,"'
in which he spoke of the great good now
being accomplished by it whereby 'he
profession of dentistry was being raised
to a higher plane. --

A SUICIDE IDENTIFIED.
It Was George Paulson Who Killed
Himself in a Shooting Gallery
. Last May.
The man who shot himself on May 18
in a Dupont-street shooting gallery was
identified last evening as George Paul
son, who resided on Dore ' street, near
Brannan. : Paulson entered the shooting
gall<-rv and after taking two shots at
the target deliberately turned the gun
upon himself and blew his brains 'out.
Until last night he was unknown to the
police and it remained for John Conners,
a youth living at 508 Brannan street, to
disclose his Identity. '< â  â __
Conners examined a photograph at the
Morgue and pronounced it a picture of
Paulson. He says the man attempted sui
cide on one occasion before by jumping
into the bay: The cause of the act is
supposed to have been remorse felt by
Paulson for having robbed his brother.
KIDNAPED ON MEXICAN SOIL.
General Bowen of Guatemala Taken
by Force and Shot to
Death.
A private letter from Mexico dated July
28 which was received in this city states
that a high-handed outrage bad been per
petrated by the agents of President Ca
brera of Guatemala against the dignity of
the Mexican. Government. The- letter
' states that General Plutarco Bowen has
been sojourning at Tapacbula, Mexico,
1 and while there was forcibly taken across
I the border into Guatemala. Arriving
c there, he was met by an armed body who
seized and bound him hand and foot and
conveyed him to the port of Ocos. From
Ocos he was shipped to Champerico. and
from Champerico by land to Marcos,
where he was shot.
This act has aroused the Mexican Gov
ernment to a- fighting pitch, and unless
Guatemala makes proper amends for its
high-handed action there will be gunpow
der in the air. .-.: v
General Bowen was a Peruvian by birth.
He had lived long in Guatemala, and rose
to be a general in the army. He was po
litically opposed to President Cabrera, and
because be had the confidence of the peo
ple Cabrera feared him and intimated that
he would have his life. In order to es
cape murder General Bowen fled to Mex
ico to meet his fate by treachery

IT WAS NOT SMITH.
Coroner Believed Him to Be Dead,
But He Turned Up Alive.
The body of an unknown man was fished
out of the hay at Fourth and. Kentucky
streets yesterday morning. It was iden
tified at the Morgue as R. W. Smith, an
employe of the Hooper Lumber Company,
and this identification was corroborated
by the landlady of the premises where
Smith lived. Last evening several friends
called at the Morgue for the purpose oi
viewing the remains, but, failing to dis
cover certain marks on the body, dis
puted the identification. In the meantime
Smith had gone to his lodgings and his
appearance frightened the landlady who
believed him to be occupying a slab at the
public institution. On being told of what
had happened. Smith hurried to the
Morgue and had his name stricken from
the Coroner's slip.'

LAST HONORS
TO THE MEMORY
OF A SOLDIER
Valor Rewarded by
Respect in Death.
COLONEL HAWKINS' FUNERAL
WITH SOLEMN MILITARY POMP
THE BODY IS BORNE AWAY.
Throngs Gather to Testify Their
Affection for a Brave Man Who
Had Twice Fought for
His Flag.
With draped colors and muffled drums
the body of a soldier was yesterday start
ed on its final march toward the bivouac
of the dead.
After having experienced in two wars
all the hardships and privations of active
campaigning, after having undergone, all
the dangers and sufferings of active work
at the front, the gallant leader of the I
Tenth Pennsylvania came home to receive i
as his rewatd only those sad tributes that
his fellow-countrymen could pay to the j
valorous dead.
Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 o'clock the
great hall of the Masonic Temple on Post
street was crowded to its "utmost capacity >
by. the throng of soldiers . and civilians j
who came to show, their respect to the :
memory of Colonel Hawkins by partici
pating "in the last rites that were to be
performed over* his body.
The funeral services took place under
the auspices of Occidental Lodge of the
Masons, of which fraternity the dead hero
was a prominent member. . ' â 
Worshipful Master Edward F. Delger
performed the services and delivered the
oration. ".';;.
At the conclusion of the ceremonies in
the hall the casket, covered by the shot
torn regimental flag, and bearing the col
onel's sword smothered in beautiful flow- ;
ers, was borne to the street by eight first
sergeants and escorted by a guard of
honor taken from the Masons, members i
of the Governor's staff and prominent
army officers now with the different or
ganizations at the Presidio. There it was
placed upon a caisson belonging to the !
Third Artillery, and, preceded by the es- I
cort* and followed by a horse with empty
saddle and reversed stirrups, it was taken
to the ferry and sent on its long journey
toward its final resting-place in the ceme
tery at "Washington, Pa.
The escort consisted of two platoons of
police under the command of Sergeant
Anderson, the Third Artillery and band
under Colonel Rawles. the Utah Battery |
under Major Grant, lone files of Masons
and the entire Pennsylvania regiment
without arms and without company for
mation, but marching in column of fours
according to rank. c
The staff of Governor Gage was repre
sented by General Seamans. Colonels Og
den. Howell, Young and Major Andrews.
Colonel Sommers and the entire regimen
tal staff of the Oregon regiment were
present, as were officers from the -Ne
braska regiment and every division of tne
military now quarteded in and about the
city.
The funeral was such a one as became
: a dashing soldier and a gallant- gentle
man, but the best and most touching
tribute that was paid to the memory of
the fearless hero was written on the
bronzed faces of the men he once led by
the tears that coursed down their cheeKS
as they followed the body of their, chief.

FELL TO HIS DEATH
FROM AN ELEVATOR
ANTHONY O'BRIEN,, A LABORER,
KILLED.
Was Plunged' to a Platform Fifteen
Feet Below Him and Sustained
a Fractured Skull.
Anthony O'Brien, a laborer, employed
on a building on First street, near Mis
sion, fell from a building elevator early
last evening, sustaining injuries which
proved fatal about three hours later.
O'Brien was going up on the elevator,
erected for the purpose of lifting brick
and mortar to the top of the structure,
when he slipped and fell to a platform
fifteen feet below. - _.-____-.
O'Brien was hurried to the Harbor Re
ceiving Hospital, where Dr. Himmelsbacn
found that the base of his skull and his
collarbone had been fractured. His in
juries the doctor pronounced to be fatal,
but everything possible was done to re
lieve his suffering. The victim passed
away about half-past 7 last night and the
body was at once removed to the Morgue.
O'Brien was about 40 years of age and
the father of a large family. He resided
at 440 Elizabeth street in this city .
Richly Appointed.
The prominent French restaurants of
the city have improved wonderfully.
"Jack's" restaurant, 615 Sacramento
street, has caught the spirit of progress
and has undergone the most thorough
renovation and improvement. New car
pets, new furniture, new decorations have
performed a complete transformation, and
now "Jacks. is, besides a home of good
living, a home of congenial surroundings
as well. The main dining-room is done in
the Louis XVI style, and is both striking
in design and finish. On the upper floors
red is the prevailing tint, while costly
carpeting of the same color gives a glow
of warmth and comfort that is truly lux
urious. The suites of the third floor are
arranged with baths and provided with
every modern convenience. Hereafter
"Jack's" will take rank as one of the most
artistic in finish as well as the most se
ductive in cuisine of any of the city's res
taurants.
More Money for a Bridge.
City Engineer Tilton filed a communi
cation with the Board of Supervisors yes
terday reciting the necessity for an in
creased appropriation for the Berkshire
street bridge because of the necessary al
terations in- the plans to prevent a set
tling- of the structure. The amount of
the increase asked for is $5391. The en
gineer stated that he had already author
ized the contractors to make the neces
sary changes in the plans.
Reduction of Interest.
The officers of the Mutual Savings
Bank, 33 Post street, of which Mayor
James D. Phelan is president and
George A. Story cashier, have decided
to reduce the rate of interest on loans
on improved city real estate to 6 per
cent. This action is taken on the part
of the bank in anticipation of a low
tax levy and also as a measure of en
terprise that has characterized this
banking institution since its establish
ment.

ILLUMINATION AND
DECORATION PLANS
The Committee Considers a Great
Many Novel and Beautiful
Suggestions.
Beautiful and novel plans for the deco
ration of the city in honor of the home
coming of the California boys were sub
mitted yesterday afternoon to the- deco
ration committee, which met in the Union
Trust Company's building, Market and.
Montgomery streets.
The members of the committee present
were W. J. Martin, chairman; I. W. Hell
man Jr., Charles, Hirsch and A. Schilling.
Plans for triumphal arches accompanied
by letters were received from Curtis To
bey Jr. and J. F. Dunne. They were, laid
over, as was a communication from A.
Barbour, containing an offer to superin
tend the decorations for the reception.
H. P. Thayer, president of the San
Francisco .Electrical Company, whose
presence in an advisory capacity had been
requested by the committee, gave the re
sult of his observations concerning the
cost of the electrical display previously
MRS. A. M. PARROTT'S MUNIFICENT
GIFT TO ST. MATTHEW'S PARISH
Handsome Church of Stone and Brick to Be Erected in San Mateo.
<-"T7*--*> HANDSOME church, the gift of Mrs. A. M. Parrott, will soon adorn East street, between Second and Third,
II \\ in the town of San Mateo. It will replace the old St. Matthew's Church and will cost $50,000. Albert Pissis Is
jL â -A the architect, and he has been preparing the plans for several months. The work on the foundation will be com-
JJ \\menced immediately. ; â¢'.'â¢.
The style will be early Italian Renaissance and the material brick and stone. Both exterior and interior will
present the same architectural features, a general harmony of structure and decoration being minutely observed in the
design. The edifice will consist of the church proper and an adjoining presbytery, connected by an ornamental covered
portico. A large and spacious basement is also planned for school' purposes. v The seating capacity of the church will be
500. . The central portion of the church will be ornamented by majestic columns. "running through; the. nave, which will be
surmounted by a lofty arch of blazoned colors. Above the chancel, which will be highly ornamental,, there will be a
â¢pipe organ specially manufactured. J ," C . j - \ .._'... Â» - - ' . *
Father Callahan, who has been for a long time the parish. priest, will still continue as the 4 spiritual director. When
the new church of St. Matthew Is completed it will be the handsomest house of worship in San Mateo County.

discussed. He said he had communicated
with several gentlemen who had an
nounced their intention of being present.
The committee decided â¢to listen to all
persons having suggestions to offer.
Charles B. Tibball was the first to be
heard. He offered a drawing of what he
proposed to do in the decorating line if
given a chance. It showed an arch ninety
feel in width and lifty-slx feet high, sur
mounted by an eagle and figures of Lib
erty and Columbia. There were provis
ions on this arch for 2000 incandescent
lights, which -would gleam from festoons
of evergreen and bunting. In addition he
proposed to raise thirty-foot poles on each
side of. the street nine feet: from each
curb and â¢ sixty -six and i two-thirds feet
apart from â¢ the ferries to Larkin; street.
These -would -be painted In white and
circled with bunting and -evergreen. - The
cost,- he roughly estimated, .would be
$2500 for the arch and the poles, 240 of
them, from $8 to $10 ' apiece, exclusive of
lights. The whole, he estimated, would
cost $7500. ' .
Mr. Tibball's plan seemed to please the
committeemen, the only thing bothering
them being the price. Mr. Hellma
thought they would not get money enough
to put it Into operation and make the
other illumination desired.
"I don't think," he said, "there is an-,
thing we can do that is too good for the
boys when they come home."
Mr. Hirsch was of the opinion that th
most beautiful decoration would be that
which was plain and simple.
Samuel Marx, manager of the Pacific
Incandescent Lamp Company, announced
his readiness to give the committee fig
ures on the illumination suggested at a
previous meeting. He said he would put
in the ten strings of parti-colored lamps
to each block, twenty-five lamps to each
string, making 5000 lamps in all, for ap
proximately $2000. All the committee would
have to do would be to touch the button,
and there would be light for one, two or
three nights, as desired. This figure would
also provide for the carting away of th
material after use.
For the illumination of the ferry depot
and City Hall. 3000 lamps each, he gave a
total figure of $4000, which would make
the illumination as outlined, minus the
dome of light, approximately $6000.
A. J. Donzel of the California Fireworks
Company submitted figures on a firework
display. William Brumfleld and George
K. Porter offered a design for an iron
arch lighted with 5000 incandescent lamps
to cost $7000. and T. P. Robinson offered a
suggestion for an evergreen and oil paint-
Ing decoration along the line of march
The figures in no case being definite, th
committee decided to postpone action un
til Monday morning.
Messrs. Schilling and Hirsch of the com
mittee especially appointed for that pur
pose reported favorably to a â¢ palm and
laurel arch near the transport dock. The
advised that citizens of outlying districts
be asked to contribute cuttings of palm
and laurel for me purpose. They also ad
vocated a plan tor decoration with palms
along the line of march, suggesting that
the foliage be placed in large gas pipes
to be painted brown to simulate the color |
of the tree trunk and placed in boxes of
earth, covered with leaves, at stated dis
tances apart along both sides of Market
street. This would lend, they urged, a
beauty to the decoration at a small ex- \
pense, taking for granted the willingness
of pipe dealers to donate the use of the
pipe or charge a small rental for it.
The same gentlemen also advocated pri- ;
vate illumination in the windows, store
and office buildings and residences by the
use of candles. They both vouched for
the splendid effect this would lend at a
nominal cost. They advised, however,
that such Illumination be confined to the
line of march to obviate danger from fire. â 
In view of the important work the dec- I
orative committee has to decide upon at j
its next meeting it was decided to invite
Mayor Phelan. M. H. de Young and A. M.
Lawrence to be present. The meeting will
be held at the office of Charles Hirsch of
the Alaska Packers' Association. 308 Mar
ket street, at 10 o'clock to-morrow morn

NOT "SOLDIER TRAMPS."
lowa's Governor Defends tha
Character of Volunteers.
DES MOINES, Aug. s.â Governor Sha**Â»
to-day received a letter from ' Edward
Rosenberg, secretary of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council, requesting the Gov
ernor's assistance to prevent the muster
ing out of the Fifty-first lowa Volunteer.-
in San Francisco. In the letter the labor
leader refers to the fact that boys will be*
boys and that San Francisco had many
evil attractions, a result of which would
be to cause them to remain in San Fran
cisco and to flood the labor market. Gov
ernor Shaw, mailed a spirited reply and
among other things he stated in the let
ter that soldiers -will not be "soldier
tramps" nor will 1 they- attempt to "beat
the trains," nor will "they be put off on
mountains and in deserts and there mis
erably perish." . He continues:
On the contrary they will return self
respectful and respected citizen soldiers, with
a record of which they will be so justly proud
as to furnish a good measure of protection
against what, -perhaps, overcomes weaker men
with no .reputation to maintain. There will
be no check placed upon- the utterances of these
men concerning the cause in which they have
been engaged. If they see fit to discredit It, it
will be their privilege to do so. One of my
predecessors once said. in a public speech: "If
you hear any one utter fine syllable against the
Government of the United States or against
the President thereof, or against the -cause for
which your boys are fighting, or do aught in
disrespect to the flag that waves over them,
shoot him where he stands. They may arrest
you, they may try you, they may convict you.
but they shall not hang you.' I'm Governor of
lowa." That spirit of patriotism is not dead
in lowa soil, and while heroic measures will
not be necessary now. I am free to say that no
returning lowa soldier need fear to resent in
any dignified and manly way any disrespectful
utterances concerning him or the cause for
which he has voluntarily and heroically risked
his life. I am sir, yours very sincerely.

not it was because the sordid dollar which
they pursue .hat they may liberate as

There were others assembled around trie

their more fortunate brethren recounted
the tale of how the field was won and
many a brave trench tale was told as
the foaming flagon passed from hand to

was a complete success. All dinners at

KING OF THE
DOPE-DREAMERS
IS AT LIBERTY
"Brick" McPherson Is
Free Again.
WON ON A TECHNICALITY
THE POLICE WASTED TIME IN
PROSECUTING HIM.
A Writ of Habeas Corpus on. His Be
half Is Heard by Judge Dunne,
Who Was Forced to Dis
charge Him.
"Brick" McPherson. he of the "dope
dream gang." is at liberty and it is said
that he will not be again arrested, at least
on the present charge against him. The
confidence operator's release was pro
cured through a writ of habeas corpus,
sworn out by his attorney, J. X. E.
Wilson, on the ground that his confine
ment v.as contrary to section 861 of the
Penal Code, which provides that prison
ers must be tried before the committing
magistrate within six days after their ar
rest. As the police went about the prose
cution of "Brick" with their usual speed
the time elapsed, a writ of habeas corpus
was sworn out and "Brick" is again a
free man.
"Brick's" application for a writ of nab
eas corpus was made returnable beiore
Judge Dunne yesterday morning. When
the case was called in answer to the de
mand Chief Lees bad the notorious pris
oner in court. J. N. E. Wilson first pre
sented his evidence showing that "Brick"
has been denied his rights under the law
and then his points to establish his posi
tion. Assistant District Attorney Grea
ny opposed the release of the "kin.'** of the
dope dreamers," entering his denial that
the accused had not been granted as
speedy a hearing as the law provides.
Clerk McQuaide of Judtje Treadwell'a
court was put on the stand, however, and
substantiated the contentions of the pe
titioner, as did the stenographer's notes
and court record. Under the circum
stances there was no alternative forjudge
Dunne but to dismiss the prisoner. The
order was made and "Brick," happy at
his release, left the courtroom. It is said
that although "Brick" will be allowed his
freedom, several more of his pals will be
arrested and prosecuted for divers and
sundry crimes.
CHARLES PARDEE'S GOAT.
Steaks in Eureka Which Cost $10
Apiece.
One of the first acts of the new Fish
â And Game Commissioner, "W. H. Keller
of Los Angeles, was to arrest Charles
Pardee, proprietor of the Vance Hotel of:
Eureka. Humboldt County, for violating
the State law which prohibits the sale of
deer meat. Mr. Keller, accompanied by
Secretary J. P. Babcock, recently went to
the Eel River hatchery and stopped for
dinner at the Vance House, which la rated
as one of the high-toned hostelries of the
northern part of the State. On the bill
of fare appeared the announcement that
one of the delicacies of the table was
"mountain goat," and the price indicated
that it was something unusually nice.
As a rule, neither Mr. Keller nor Mr.
Babe has any fancy for the flesh of
the goat as an article of diet. Â«-nd under ;
ordinary circumstances they would have
to be very hungry to eat it.
But it was the price that caught their
eyes, and the waiter was instructed to
bring in two fine steaks of the "mountain
goat." In time it appeared, and the odor
was - ifQcient to show that it was fine
venison. -Without indulging in the re
past, which would have destroyed the
evidence, the Commissioners paid their
bills and pocketed the steaks. Thus the
sale was effected. Then came a raid upon
the kitchen and pantry. The astonished
cook, waiters and host stood aghast when \
the guests rummaged over the place and
discovered what remained of the "goat."
Mr. Pardee was arrested, but he took
his mortification in good part and after
pleading guilty paid a fine of $_"} to the
Justice of the Peace.
- -
Breeds Malarial Fever.
A petition was filed with the Board of
Health yesterday, --â -â ! by Drs. Julius C.
Voje, J. Simpson. E. L. Wemple. D. B.
Todd, T. Cachot and Alfred McLaughlin,
calling attention to the prevalence of ma
larial fever in South San Francisco, on
Sixth aveniie - th, between L and X
streets, and aring that the same is due
to the fact that sewage in that vicinity,
having no proper outlet, flows upon the
surface of the street and in the vacant
lot?. The Board of Health is requested to
recommend to the Supervisors the con
struction of a sewer in the street named,
and this will probably be done if the facts
are found to be as stated in the petition,
after an investigation.

KENNEALLY TO
GET HIS JOB
ON THE FRONT
Percy Henderson In
duced to Resign.
A POWER BEHIND THE SCREEN
DAN BURNS' SATELLITES PULL
DOWN THE WHARFINGER.
Will Release His Claims on the Port
Wardenship to Cover the
Bungling Errors of
Governor Gage.
The political squabble -Trowing out of
the blunder of Governor Gage in appoint
in*? four new Port Wardens without the
confirmation of the Senate, and neglect
in**;' to conform with the statutes by fail
ure to appoint at least two master marin
ers, has reached a ripe climax.
Chief Wharfinger Percy Henderson, who
also holds the position of Port "Warden,
having been appointed Dv Governor Budd.
has been Induced to resign from the latter
job in order that Assemblyman Charlie
Kenneally may assume the duties of that
office, even though he has no right to un
der the law.
Wharfinger Henderson has not as yet
presented his resignation, but it Is under
stood that be has agreed to do so for
Kenneally's sake. The resignation will
probably" be forwarded to the Governor
Monday morning. i-.'"'-'-
Ever since the new Port Wardens were
appointed by Governor Gage in such a
bungling manner there were few along !
the water front who believed that they;
would ever take their seats. â "â¢--;, _
Kenneallv, Charles S. fcpear of Oakland
and Senator Burnett, all of whom were
appointed by the Governor in recognition
of their efforts in behalf of Dan Burns
during the recent disgraceful Senatorial
campaign, were each handed a go; i brick,
and It was not only considered doubtful
by men of law whether they would event
ually get their seats but highly improb
able.
The proposed resignation of Wharfinger
Henderson to make way for Kenneally is
quite an unexpected move, though it has
been generally known for the past few
weeks that friends of the Governor and
Dan Burns' outfit have been attempting
to pull him down.
Now that a soft berth has been made
for Kenneallv they will undoubtedly at
tempt to induce the remainder of Gov
ernor Budd's appointees to retire in favor ;
of Gage's unlawful appointees. This will j
be a task bordering on the impossible, as
none of the rest of the incumbents are
fortunate enough to be on the State pay- j
roll in any other capacity.
Kenneallv was on the water front all
day yesterday, becoming acquainted with
his new duties. , 1
"Yes I have decided to resign my posi
tion as Port Warden." said Chief Wharf- .
inger Henderson when seen yesterday by
_ call reporter. "You see. I am well sat- i
isfied with my position as chief wharfin
ger and I don't want to be selfish. The
Port Wardenship is a fee job. and as long <
as I am satisfied with the chief wharfin
g-ership I may as well resign and give .
somebody else a chance." -:,:.:
MRS. STERETT GOT
A COMFORTABLE SUM
JOSEPHINE WALTER FILES HER
FIRST ACCOUNT.
The Man Who Made jj the Orpheum
Famous Left an Estate Running
Up Into the Hundreds
of Thousands.
The first annual account and report of
Josephine Walter, as administratrix of
the estate of the late Gustav Walter, was
filed yesterday, and for the first time the
amount paid Mrs. Emma Sterett, who
lived with the deceased for several years,
in liquidation of all her claims, is made
known. In cash and its equivalent Mrs.
Sterett received in all $26,500. Of this
amount It appears that $20,000 was in cash
and the release of two notes, one for 16000
and the other for $1500. secured by Ala
meda County real estate, makes up the
balance. During the year Mrs. Walter
has realized In cash from various sales,
Including that of the Walter Orpheum
Company stock and interest on stocks and
bonds and cash on deposit, the sum of
JifiO .-â¢ The cash paid out. Including
$40 55 paid Pinkerton's National Detective
I Agency and $S paid Detective John W.
Wendel when Mrs. Sterett started her
legal battle; 80,009 to Mrs. Walter and
$333 33 to other heirs; $39 25 to J. J. Butler
for his difficult labor of serving a subpena
on Mrs. Sterett; the sum of 55 cents for
telegraphic expenses to the Constable of
Walnut Creek In regard to the where
abouts of Mrs. Sterett and for the Con
stable's fruitless efforts to find her. $1 50;
and the settlement of many outstanding
accounts, amounts to $51,223 S6. leaving a
balance on hand of $39,614 92. All property
remaining In the hands of the adminis
tratrix, including cash, is valued at $176,
--317 42. i
It is further set forth that there still
remain claims against the estate, in- ;
eluding claims rejected, $4."iÂ»; Westerfeld
suit for damages for personal injuries,
$10,210: claims approved but unpaid, $4SO.
and claims upon which action is yet to be
taken. $1510 40, amounting In all to
$17,103 40.
The heirs of the estate are Josephine
Walter, decedent's widow: August Wal
ter, a brother; Louis Walter, a brother:
Fredericka Berkenbusch, sister; Herman
"Walter," a brother; Emma Gramscrfutz,
Martha Jacobi and Else Muther, children
of Ottllle Walter, a deceased sister: Wil
liam Robert, Frank P., Walter, Max A.
and Charles Schimpf, children of a de
ceased sister, Bertha Schimpf. Appear
ance has also been made by the children
of Henrietta Schubert, claiming her to be
a deceased sister of Gustav Walter.

ENGINEERS WANT MONEY.
Refuse to Continue Work on Plans for
Sewerage System.
Unless the Board of Supervisors takes
steps to provide $20,000 to pay for the labor
involved In preparing the plans for a new
sewerage system for San Francisco at its
meeting to-morrow afternoon the engin
eers emtsged upon that task will throw up
the 2oritract. In fact, they have prac
tically thrown it up already, although
they will probably- reconsider their action
If the Supervisors provide the necessary
cash. The ultimatum of Engineers Grun
sky and Hanson was received by Auditor
Wells yesterday in the form of a commu
nication asking what he proposed to do
in reference to the resolution passed by
the board several weeks ago authorizing
the payment of $1500 to them on account
and inclosing a copy of a letter the en
gineers had addressed to their draughts
men directing them not to do any more
work on the plans except at their own
risk. _.'â â¢â â¢â¢â â¢
Later in the day City Engineer Tilton
had a conference with the Auditor and
the latter informed him that he did not
feel justified in paying the demands of
the special engineers engaged upon the
work under the present circumstances un
less ordered to do so by the court.
The Auditor holds that the Board of
Supervisors exceeded its authority when
it transferred the sum of $20,000 from the
street lighting fund to a special fund
designed to cover the expense of the sew
erage plans. He is willing to audit about
$600 worth of demands for material pur
chased by the engineers, but will not pay
out any money for services rendered
while so many other bills against the city
which are due and payable are outstand
ing If the board will make provision for
the payment of the engineers in the new
tax levy the difficulty can be easily sur
mounted. That would necessitate the re
scinding at to-morrow's meeting of the
former resolution and the passing of an
other authorizing the payment of the
money out of the general fund for the
next fiscal year. _^
Such a plan would do away with the
objections of the Auditor and provide the j
means for carrying on the work.
FOB MILLIONS OF FISH.
Increasing the Capacity of the Eel
River Hatchery.
Fish and Game Commissioner H. W.
Keller of Los Angeles and J. P. Bibcock
have just returned from a trip to the Eel
River hatchery, where they have been for
the past two weeks arranging for the en
larging of that institution as provided by
a bill by the recent Legislature. Mr. Kel
ler let a contract for the enlargement of
the hatchery building, the addition being
30x40 feet. This will increase the hatch
ery's capacity by 10,000,000 eggs.
Another contract was let for the con
struction of a five-room cabin for the use
of the superintendent of the place. These
contracts will have to be completed by
September 10. It was further decided to
construct two large rearing ponds, one
above and the other below the buildings,
which will permit of holding all the small
fry until they are of suitable size to start
for their home in the sea.
School Children Vaccinated.
One hundred and fifty school children
were vaccinated by Dr. Klonk yesterday.
The Board of Supervisors provided 300
vaccine points, and the physician donated
his services.

conviction. The second trial occupied the
pas* three days. Gilligan frankly admit

I attacked him on a previous occasion by
| kicking him. and when he plunged a
; breadknife into his victim's neck, sever
ing the jugular vein, he did so because his
i own life was in imminent danger.

AN OLD WILL
CONFLICTS WITH
RECENT FACTS
Peculiar Testimony of
the Schumanns.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Aug. 5.
Was William Schumann drowned in a
vessel that left Melbourne for Germany
In l-SS? Upon this solution of th;.-- ques
tion depends the distribution of an estate
valued at 110,000. The will devising this
property has been probated In the Supe
rior Court of this county.
Charles A. Schumann, for many years
head -gardener at Woodward's Gardens
when that resort was the leading place
of amusement in the metropolis, was
known to many thousands of people
whom he met at the garden. For many
years he filled that position and when old
age came upon him he went to the Alten
helm at Fruitvale, the heme for aged
Germans.
He bad been a thrifty man and had
never married, and when the popularity
of the garden declined and rendered his
services no longer necessary he had an
estate consisting of money in bank and
other property valued at about $10,000. He
died in the horn- in ISPS.
After his death H. H. Claussen of San
Francisco produced a will alleged to have
been written by Schumann in IS7I and
which bequeathed his estate to his sister
Emilie and his brother William In equal
parts. The will was witnessed by a no
tary, who cannot be found, and the other
executor besides Claussen was A. H.
Borath. who has been dead many years.
E. L. Rein one of the witnesses to the
will, testified in court as to its making.
Several affidavits have been filed which
throw a mystery around the will. Emilie
Schumann, who is now a resident of New
York, baa given testimony which the law
yers are not quite able to reconcile. She
says that Charles A. Schumann, who died
at the Altenheim. was baptized as John
Augustus Bernard Schumann and that he
changed his name when he came to this
country to Charles A. Schumann, in I>>7o,
according to her testimony, Charles Schu
mann, her brother, having just returned
from a visit to' Germany and learned that
she was In New York, called on her in
that city and held a conversation with
her twenty-nine years ago, which she well
remembers. They discussed the fact that
their brother William sailed from Ger
many to Melbcurne in 1854 and that he
wrote home and that the following year
he was returning to Germany in a vessel
that was wrecked and all hands were
drowned. They also talked of other fam
lly matters showing that Charles A.
Schumann was fully cognizant of the fact
that William vas dead and that Emilie
in IS7O was living in New York, where she
went from Germany in IMB.
In spite of these facts testified to by
Emilie Schumann, the will which- was
made one year after this conversation
sets forth thai the estate is to be divided
between "mv sister Emilie, at present a
resident of Pomerania, Prussia, and my
brother William, who is now in the Prus
sian Royal Navy.''
Th<Â» evidence presented was considered
by th** court sufficient to justify a partial
distribution of the estate so far as Emilie
Schumann was concerned. The other half
is the property of William Schumann, or
his heirs, should he have perished in the
wreck and should he have left any chil
dren. The conflict between the star*-
ments of Emilie Schumann and the terms
of the will may lead to a legal fight for
the half of the estate left to the brother
William.
EX-SOLDIER NARROWLY
ESCAPES ASPHYXIATION
OAKLAND. Aug. s.â William Smith, an
ex-soldier of the Nebraska regiment, was
almost asphyxiated at a cheap lodging
house on Sixth street this morning. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where Dr. Kitchinga and Steward Bor
chert revived him and saved his life.
From best accounts Smith came over
from San Francisco last night to visit a
friend named "Jack" Ferguson at West
Oakland. The couple made the rounds,
imbibed freely and wound up at the house
at 460 Sixth street shortly after 4 o'clock
this morning. Smith was so much the
worse for liquor that the landlady lit
the gas for him. telling him to turn it out
when he retired. It is supposed that he
blew it out, fox about 1 o'clock one of the
lodgers found him unconscious and his
room filled with gas. Smith was at first
inclined to lay the blame for his narrow
escape to his friend Ferguson, but on a
second thought he denied this statement
and intimated that he had "tried the gas
route " Later he gave his rc^si,. nee as
being at the Anderson House, Haywards,
but this is discredited and he is believed
to reside in San Francisco.
No Doubt of Captain Barnes' Death.
ALAMEDA. Aug. s.â There Is now no
longer a doubt that Captain Douglas G.
Barnes of 637 Taylor avenue met death
by drowning in the Yukon. Captain
Barnes was sailing in a skiff on the
rive** when the boat capsized and dis
appeared. The boat was found later
many miles down the stream. There was
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. AUGUST 6, 1899.

a faint hope that Captain Barnes had
reached shore and made his way inland.
A letter received here from Captain Dah
ler of the steamer Dawson City confirms
the report of Captain Barnes' death. The
body of the deceased had not been re
covered at the time the news was sent.
GUSSIE FUEGEL CRIST
SUES FOR A DIVORCE
OAKLAND, Aug. s.â The long- threat
ened divorce suit of Gussie Fuegel Crist
against Julius Crist was filed in the Su
... late this afternoon by the
wife's attorneys. Snook & Church. in
the complaint cruelty is charged as the
ground for cause of action. The parties

nery proprietor. The parties were mar
ried" in 1803.
Susannah Steel, through her attorneys,
Quinn & Stetson, both Oakland Justices,
also filed suit to-day for a divorce from
William D. Steel, alleging intemperance.
Desertion is the ground on which Lois

complaint filed to-day against Frank
; Hawthorne. The latter is employed in the
repair shops of the Southern Pacific Com
j pany-at West Oakland.

HOW SOLDIERS DIE
ON THE FIRING LINE
OAKLAND, Aug. s.â Mrs. May Stevens Boysen. the woman who went on <
the firing line with the boys in the Philippines, has just written to her mother -
In this city and has presented a few features of war life not generally ban
died by coÂ» respondents. A story on Mrs. Boysen's work was recently pub- ;
lished in The Call. Mrs. Boysen say?: 'â¢
"Can it be possible that my work at the front has really got Into the ;
papers? Well, it takes a smal! fire to make a big smoke, doesn't it? '
"This is how it happened: Curiosity took me out at first, for I did not be- â 
Sieve I would be allowed to stay, and. being there, naturally I turned to and ;
helped the boys-only to smooth the damp hair from their brows, to wasn ;
their faces with cool water and give them a pressure of the hand that
seemed to them a mountain of comfort. '.. :
"Many ...vs. in the delirium of pain, would call 'Mother.' I would just
take them In my arms as though I were their mother.
"Poor boys. Some of them died with their heads on my shoulder. And
now, as I think of those days, long past yet ever present with me, I cannot
control myself for thinking of my own who might have been in their place.
"General Wheaton's heart is so big and kind that after a battle and he
learns our losses we know his sympathies are with the fallen and the
friends who are left In far-away, dear old America.
"I am glad beyond expression that I have been able to do something to
relieve the poor, suffering soldiers, for only those who are here can realize
the discomfort and difficulties under which we labor.
"On Monday, th*- 19th of June. I was down at Imus, and It was the only
time I was in serious danger, for when the reinforcements were sent out I
was entirely cut off, but I got Into my carriage and put out as fast as pos
sible for B-COOr, the next town, where there is a garrison. Every man had
to p., out to help the reconnoissance party. I was very anxious to accom
pany them, but General Wheaton would not allow me, as it was an open
country and there were no trenches for protection.
" 'Major Belle Reynolds' is here in our hotel. She is very nice, and al
though she is (50 years of age she is handsome stillâ tall and straight and
withal a lovely woman.
"I have a cane made from the wood erf the Spanish flagship Reina Chris
tina, with the teredo holes all through It. It also shows the scorching from
th** fire. A native went down in two feet of water to saw It from the hand
rail. There were cinders and mussel shells all over it when he brought it
up. My friends all envy rat. my prize.
"Chaplain Fleming of the Colorados is a friend of mine, and has been
much interested in my work here, calling me the 'Red Cross nurse," after
the Helen Gould and Astor style, meaning I am here on my own responsi
bility.
"A pathetic incident occurred In our hospital that brought tears to our
eyes. .\ poor young Filipino girl was brought in with a broken leg. Al
though so young she was a mother. She had lost her baby and it was pitiful
to hear her cry. She was running away when the bullet hit her, and she
could not tell where she had left the childâ poor thing! We have made her as
comfortable as possible, but she still mourns for her lost baby.
â 1 have the satisfaction of feeling that I have accomplished some good.
It is a balm to me for all other trials I have enduredâ and they have not
been a few. However, it has not been all clouds without some sunshine, for
I have lust received a present from some of the boys I have looked after in
the field. , ,_ "
"It is a Spanish decoration of silver and beautiful enamel, such as is
worn by the Chief Justice. It is a rare souvenir, which I prize highly, and
as we hope soon to be on our way home I shall be proud to show it to my
friends.''

FIERCE COMBAT
WITH A ROBBER
â¦ S
Rancher Waylaid and
Despoiled.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 5.â Goili,
a prosperous farmer and dairyman of
this county, had an exciting experience
with a highway robber last night.
Goili considers himself lucky in having
escaped alive. Arthur Campbell has
been arrested, and the chain of circum
stances fixing the crime upon him
seems complete.
Goili had been in town during the
day, and late in the afternoon started
for his ranch in the Alpine district. On
the way he stopped at Cutter's saloon,
a half-mile from the summit of . the
mountain. Here Goili first met Camp
bell. During the evening Goili showed
considerable money, which did not es
cape the attention of the stranger. Fi
nally the latter picked up his shotgun,
which was standing against the bar,
and left. A half hour later Goili start
ed for home with his spring wagon and
two horses.
About 500 yards from the saloon
Goili met a man standing in the middle
of the roa*d. As he approached the
man stepped aside and he passed on.
The fellow followed, and, as his tracks
in the road ended there, he must have
jumped upon the rear end of the
wagon. This was all unknown to
Goili, or he would not have been taken
by- surprise as he was later. The man
kept quiet until they reached the top
of the grade, but as they started to de
scend the other side he seized Goili by
the throat and pulled him backward
from the seat. Goili yelled lustily as
he grappled with the robber. The noise
frightened the horses and caused them
to run away down the grade. The men
were struggling all the time. The
horses had gone about 200 yards when
they turned suddenly around, throwing
both men into the road.
Here the struggle was renewed, and
the men rolled down the grade into the |
underbrush. 1 Goili was calling for help
all the time. His repeated cries aroused j
the Eikerenkotter boys, who keep a
resort on % the summit, and they went to I
his assistance. The robber heard them I
coming and fled down the gulch.
The struggle must have been a fierce 1
one, for the highwayman had one of his
shoes torn from his feeL It was found 1
by the officers at the spot this morn- I
ing. George Eikerenkotter notified I
Sheriff Mansfield here, and he and Dep
uty Sheriff Butts left for the scene at
2 o'clock this morning. They reached ;
the camp opposite Cutter's saloon just i
at daybreak and arrested Campbell, j
who had just arrived there. He was
bareheaded and minus one shoe. Noth
ing belonging to Ooili was found in his
possession, it being the theory of the
officers that he either secreted his booty j
or else threw it away.
VOLUNTEERS TO CURE
THE YANKEE TWANG
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1299, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, Aug*. s.â As an instance of how
the Paris Ileraid is read in every corner
of Europe and manually studied by every
society, an American wrote to the Herald
an amusing letter in which he stated his
daughter was about to marry a distin
guished Baron, who, however, strongly
objected to the Yankee twang of his fu
ture father-in-law. A flood of replies fol
lowed, giving remedies embellished with
humor and caustic wit peculiar to those
who have lived under the sheltering wings
of the American eagle. Of course, this
was all fun. To cap the climax of this
extraordinary correspondence a French
doctor, innocent of the real spirit of the
thing and who apparently has never
heard of Mark Twain, writes in dead
earnest on the -.Ã¼bject. saying: "It is
possible to cure the American twang of
which Johnson despairs. But don't go to
hot springs, as many readers have ad
vised, but study the difficult"" from a sci
entific point of view-." In his letter this
worthy French professor gives a number
of testimonials from Americans who have
been cured, but this is mere detail, and
the writer is evidently confident that he
has found a Klondike and he will proba
bly add to his circulars: "Americans
made to speak with a correct foreign ac
cent. Best vernacular only used."
Found Dead in a Creek.
SAN JOSE, Aug. s.â The body of Joseph
Demartini. an Italian laborer, was found
in a creek near Almaden to-day. There
was no evidence of foul play. An inquest
will lie held to-morrow.

THE northeast the work Pacific avenue and begun at once. will be ornamented with one of the handsomest homes 1n
San Francisco. Reid Brothers, the well-known architects, have just finished plans of a residence for John D.
Spreckels and the work of building will be begun at once.
1 The edifice will be in the Italian renaissance style, bright colored terra cotta and light stone being the ma
â¢*â  terial used. In dimensions and beauty of outline the building will be a work of architectural excellence. Set
back thirty feet from the street, it will cover an area of ninety feet square. Three stories above the basement will
rive a. lofty elevation in harmony with the bread base. Â_-â¢__â¢â¢__
But for the four circular bays the building would be a complete square. Two porticos one on Laguna street, the other
on Pacific avenue, will relieve the central portions facing these streets. They are formed by four beautitul columns two
Tories in height and of light terra cotta material. The carriage entrance will be on the east side of the house.
â¢The interior has not yet been designed outside of a large central hall two stories in height, finished in renaissance
i
Style 'on the south and* west sides an unbroken view of the bay, straits and Marin shores is attained.
PLAYFOLK, AS
REVEALED BY
SECOND SIGHT
SOME characters there are of so
little depth that their life histories
may be laid bare with a few wags
of the tongue, and some dramatic
productions there are of so little
worth and of such hasty growth that
their few merits and many faults may be
dismissed after 12 p. m. with a few
scratches of the quill. Such are not in
review when the thought comes that all
critics should be obliged by law to see a
play twice and then in no haste and in
the quiet of their studies write their im
pressions thoughtfully. For. after all,
what right have most of us to criticize in
a hasty hour the result of years of study
and months of thought, and thereby give
the public no adequate idea of the educa
tion that lies at their door? Yes,
How the world would ope Its eyes
Should critics act and actors criticize.
"Hamlet" has been reviewed, but noth
ing has been said of the production or the
scenery. Seeing the third act again calls
to mind certain growths whose wont it is
to shoot up inches in a single night and
yet contain a strength to build upon. This
is Mr. Miller's best act. and in it he
creates the role of Hamlet according to
his light, which during this act burns
very clear, and in it he is reminiscent of
no one. The new reading he gives to
"Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool,
farewell! I took- thee for thy better," is
a masterful stroke. We have heard it
always said in haste, as though .a heavy
weight were dropped in sudden satisfac
tion. Mr. Miller takes time for regret and
Hamlet is revealed a man of so tine feel
ing that no crushing personal sorrow can
brutalize him. Tenderness, that is the
charm of the. scene in the Queen's apart
ment. The force of a brutal line Is broken
by a telling gesture. "You . shall not
budge!" ana with gentle force he folds her
to his heart. Mrs. Boucieault as the
Queen is in Mr. Miller's hands an instru
ment to be played upon, and beautifully
she responds to the slightest touch. The
first night he pointed her to prayer, and
in obedience she knelt. The second night
she became so imbued with his spirit that
impulse led her, and the effect was ex
quisite. This is but one of many new
beauties revealed at a second hearing. If
such studies be possible in a single night,
what does Mr. Miller's future Hamlet hold
for us? One thing let us rememberâ
will be Mr. Miller's Hamlet, and when it
shall live, up to its third act, when ex
perience in that part shall have developed
Introspection, melancholy, philosophy,
poetry, it will probably be a great one.
In the service of his theory that a certain
atmosphere can best be created in a cer
tain way he makes no entrance in the first
act but in the midst of pomp and cere
mony and gayety and false glitter is, by
a movement of the crowd, revealed, a
crouching figure, sick to the heart of it
all. When the production shall reach its
desires and Cleopatra-like magnificence
shall color this scene, what a wonderful
effect will thus be produced!
Genius directs the entrance at the
words, "To be or not to be." The whole
state of the man's mind is revealed in a
single move. Had Mr. Miller made the
soliloquy to that entrace he would have
done a great work. But he did not. The
introduction cf the ghost when the King
kneels to pray is a new thought and sym
bolizes the weight that has crushed the
man's conscience to its knees. No search
ing limelight forces a body corporal upon
us for a spirit. A thin blue haze sur
rounds a moving essence of the character,
and illusion is wonderfully assisted there
by. The staging is beautiful. Front
scenes have been done away with and
much 13 presented in the open. Moonlight
and sunlight stream down, as they should,
from the flies, and the effect is perfect. A'
drop in the churchyard reveals in atmos
pheric perspective the castle of Elsinore
and helps to connect the thought of the
grave with the thought of the mourners.
Just here the idea comes that the grave
diggers' scene up to "Fetch me a stoup
of liquor" might in any production be
with dramatic advantage dispensed with.
Another heresy! The interiors are chron
ologically looked to and artistically de
veloped, and the tableau curtains are a
consolation to the eye. A drop curtain
always comes down like a guillotine
chops the head off sympathy and leaves
a row of feet the last picture on the
retina. Chronologically it would be dif
ficult to costume Hamlet, for tenth cen
tury episodes are clothed more or less in
thirteenth century dialogue, but the cos
tuming of the Miller production takes a
middle course and Is successful. .". : :
Miss Anglln, having created a new
Ophelia, must bravely accept criticism.
Not a line is spoken as we hay ever
heard it, not an action done as we
have seen it. The pensive, yielding,
poetic Ophelia gives place to a creature
of spirit and intelligence. The real hor
ror of madness ls presented, and yet the
beauty of the* scene is not for a moment
lost. "Whatever development may come
with repetition, it is to be hoped the pres
ent grasp of the character may not be
loosened by criticism.
â¢ â¢ -.-;_â¢;,;
The sophistication of Juliet's lines be
ginning "Spread thy close curtain, love
performing night" would at first thought
preclude th** idea of the balcony scene
being played with the comedy spirit of in
genuous girlhood. But when we remem
ber that it is probable she had many a
time seen the nuptial pageant and learned
these or words like them from the nuptial
hymn, the girlish, bubbling joy she takes
in her first feelings of love are easily
reconciled as natural. Florence Roberts,
the maiden Juliet, gives the daintiest pos
sible comedy touches to every line of the
balcony scene from the moment she dis
covers Romeo until she bids him a flnad
good-night. Whatever tradition may hang
about this scene, one feels Intuitively that
Miss Roberts' interpretation is right; and
even if it were not we would not have it
changed, so charming is her reading, so
youthful is her joy. Here Is a part of a
note written to her by some unknown ad
mirer, more wag than fool: "As Juliet
you are great, and mash Romeo in flne
shape. When I saw you in the balcony I
wished you would always wear balconies,
they are so becoming: but when 1 saw
you dead I thought you were best that
wav We can't all be handsome corpses."
One thing in connection with Mr.
Whittlesey's Romeo has not been noted.
He never forgets in his Interview that the
Capulet servants are asleep, and many a
Romeo we have seen would have waked
the dead. The orchestra is under the
stage at the Alcazar, and the management
talks of reviving the play for Miss Rob
erts' closing week.

At the Grand Opera-house this week
William Wolf and his two colleagues eas
ily divide the honors with merry Boccac
cio. The trio in the first act is funny
enough for a vaudeville sketch. The
chorus of male voices is particularly
grateful to the ear. It is a relief some
time-* not to hear sopranos reaching, with
success, for a place above all the rest of
the harmony. Georgie Cooper is a new
acquisition from the Tivoli. She has tal
ent, but must overcome the habit of a
stooping, ducking carriage if she would
make the right impression on her audi
ences.

In the person of Anna Held Idalene Cot

resents the superlative degree. Her im
personation of Johnstone Bennett is also
very good. Duse and Mrs. Fiske are .inter

Those stars do not twinkle for us. Nick
Long can no one thing at least exceed-
Ingly well, and tnat is French dialect and
its accompanying gestures. Next week
they hold out the dazzling prospectus of
an act from "Zaza." Words of a critic are
not needed to persuade people to the Or
pheum. The general even merit of its per
formances is too old a story. The crowds
one sets at all the theaters seem to indi
cate that being amused is the sole nightly
occupation of the entire community.
CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
Soldier Arrested for Begging.
John J. Reilly, a casual at the Presidio,
was arrested yesterday afternoon by Po
liceman D. Coleman and booked at the
City Prison on a charge of begging. He
accosted a newspaper man at Market and
Kearny streets and asked him for 10
cents to buy tobacco, as he was suffering
untold agonies from lack of the weed
When searched at the City Prison he had
30 cents in his pocket. He vowed ven
geance against his accuser.
FEARS FOR THE SAFETY
OF THE SHIP MACDUFF
ASTORIA. Or.. Aug. s.â Local shipping
men are beginning to fear for the _afety
of the British ship Mac Duff. Hope for
the vessel has not been given up, but as
the weeks roll by and no news comes of
her grave fears arise. It is possible that
she has been delayed by calms or head
winds, but she is now seventy days over
due, and many believe she has been lost.
The Mac Duff sailed from Calcutta lor
Astoria on February S with a cargo of
grain bags. She may have encountered
typhoons in the Bay pf Bengal or It may
be that she has been driven southward
or delayed by calms. She left Calcutta
during the typhoon season, and it is much
more likely that storms, and not calms,
were encountered. The passage from
Calcutta out to the open ocean ls one
which is always attended by danger ow
ing to the many islands in the vicinity,
and experienced navigators frequently
meet mishaps. An ordinary passage .from
Calcutta to Astoria requires about 100
days. The Mac Duff is out 179 days and 20
per cent reinsurance has been offered on
her.
The ship is small, registering 1235 tons,
and carries about twenty-five men all
told. She is in command of Captain
Huelin. In consequence of her long pas
sage and the growing probability of ncr
loss the price of grain bags has gone up.
BADGER CREEK GOLD.
BOISE. Idaho, Aug. s.â While reports
from the Badger Creek gold district vary
quite as much as usual in such cases, the
information coming in strongly tends to
confirm the belief that a very important
section has been opened. The original
Badger Creek discovery, the Copper
Queen claim, has been developed suffi
ciently to show there is ten feet of ore
at the least. Many high assays have been
secured, but conservative men put the
average value at from $25 to $50 a ton.
Information reached town this evening
of the discovery of a large ledge on Bad
ger Creek, a quarter of a mile from the
Copper Queen. A man who saw some of
the cropplngs pronounced them very fine.
The Copper Queen appears to be on th-Â»
hanging wall of a great quartz! ledge
in granite. The quartzite is probably 200
feet thick and indications of mineraliza
tion are found at many points on it.
Site for Stockton's Postoffice.
STOCKTON. At*g. s.â Special Agent
Roberts of the Treasury Department at
Washington, who came here a few days
ago to get prices on two strips of land re
quired for an addition . to the postoffice
site, settled on the figures for the prop
erty to-day and returned to San Fran
cisco. The price for the desired strip is
about $9000. Mr. Roberts will recommend
closing the deal and it is believed the
erection of the postoffice will be com
menced early next year. The appropria
tion for the building is $150,000 and is
available now.

NEW TOItK, Aug. s.â There was not much
doing in the stock market to-day. The half
holiday on Saturday takes away many active
operators, on holiday trips. The London Ex
change was closed and will be again on Mon
day, thus subtracting an appreciable feature
in the usual activity. Nevertheless the day's
dealings show a fairly irate reflection of
speculative opinion in general conditions. There
was some disposition to advance prices in the
early dealings on account of the uniformity
of the favorable reports on all branches of busi
ness contained In the weekly reports of com
mercial agencies. But this condition is a fac
tor in the anxiety -..-.- the money outlook,
which again dominated sentiment as the time
approached for the publication of the weekly
bank statement. Money is In such large de
mand that the supply for speculative uses is
greatly curtailed. The bank statement; when
it appeared, was again weal beyond all -â -
pectation. With forced liquidation in progress
at some points in Europe, and with a possible
demand for money to move the crops, the state
ment brought selling of stocks and a general
sharp decline. The market closed generally
weak and â .-.-:. -_Â«â -.:â¢â *-.-. _.â¢
The stock market . Heated during the week
a disposition to move upward, but was re
strained by several conditions, most notable of
which was the ccjntinued anxiety over the fu
tura of the money market The money rate
throughout the week held stiffly at about 4 per
cent. In spite of the elements of doubt and
the absence of a majority of big operators and
leading spirits on vacation trips business has
fchown a notable Increase ever last week's flg
urtis and the average level of prices ls higher.
This is most notably true in the Industrial
Stocks on account of the great activity and
prosjK-rlty In all kinds of business, especially
the Iron and steel industry.
Events in the financial world continue to
shape themselves toward a higher rate for
money for some time to come. There is evi
dence that in the general tide of prosperity
the extension of credits in some quarters has
been on so libe.ral a scale as to draw down
reserve-* below the point of sufficient security
from â¢ a â¢â¢ conservative .'standpoint. Thus' the
Bank of England and the Continental banks
have been struggling tp replenish their bul
lion reserves. The London money market
loans in Germany are being called home. Gov
ernment statistics In Great Britain, Ger
many and France show a large expansion of
trade, so that in spite of the replenishment of
banking reserves going on in nil three centers
there Is Increasing employment for money.
Under the circumstancis the foreign money
markets have shown themselves very sensi
tive to the heavy downward tendency of both
sterling and Continental exchange at New
York based on offerings of exchange bills ln
the market against coming shipments of
grain. Evidently It has entered Into the cal
culations of foreign financiers that money
would be so abundant in this country that we
could afford to lend the credits established by
our export movement of merchandise. The
low state of the New Tork bank reserve also
causes some anxiety as to whether it will not
be necessary to call home our credits, which
I would force sales of securities to avoid ship
ments hither of gold.
The activity In the bond market has been
the greatest in the speculative issues, which
have advanced. Changes generally have been
small. United States 2s, 3s and new 4s ad

Associated Banks' Statement.
V â _ â _ â â j
NEW YORK. Aug. s.â The New York Finan- j
cier says: Despite the fact that the associated ]
banks of New York reduced their, loan com- ]
mitments by nearly $6,500,000 last week and de- |
posits by $12,239,500, thus lowering reserve re- j
quirements $3,039,000, the loss of $5,760,400 in |
specie and~legals caused a further drain of |
$2,700,525 on surplus reserves, bringing that i
Item to $8,110,600, or only about $3,000,000 in ex
cess of the lowest point touched one month .
ago. Since that period the banks, despite the |
manifest effort ' to recoup reserves, have lost
at least $10,000,000 of cash holdings, although
they have gained J.'*.i , OO.oi.'O excess surplus. Tins
has been accomplished by the contraction of
nearly $41,000,000 of loans and $52,000,000 of de
posits, an unusually heavy liquidation at this
-period. The treasury demands have been
responsible for the steady loss. It Is a ques
tion how much longer the present conditions
can prevail. The disbursements of the treas
ury of the August interest and the receipts of j
specie from the West, from Australia and the
Klondike may partly relieve the situation, but
at the threshold of the crop season the situa
tion is excitins serious consideration. The
statement perhaps does not reflect other than
transitory conditions. At any rate there seems
to be no difficulty in obtaining accommoda
tions at this center and money rates are com
paratively easy. The loss of specie reported is
due to shipments to Montreal on account of the
bank failures there, and receipts from other
centers are known to have been large enough to
counteract this loss, even though the statement
does not show it. Interest in the situation
from now on centers in the demand for crop
rnonev and the ability of interior banks to
meet 'it. Any drain on New York is bound to
bring relief in the way of gold Imports, for
exchange is now declining in a manner that
foreshadows such a conclusion. Still, the sea
son may be tided over without this course. The
fact that the dearth of money can be traced
to the wonderful trade prosperity of the coun
try puts a different complexion on the situa
tion "than has been the case in past years,
when uncertainty and doubt prevailed.

<--. : _ . -$>
CHICAGO, Aug. Opening trades ln wheat
both for December and September were at
slight declines from yesterday's prices, Sep
tember starting %Â®%c lower at 69%@69%c, and
In the course of the next half hour's tracing
the price took a further drop to 69c. The Eng
lish cable news was more or less colorless as
a rule, and the interest in trading was small
even at the opening. Sellers were in the ma
jority, however. The weather in the North
west was favorable for harvesting operations, i
and the Kansas State crop report predicted
large crops of both wheat and corn, the con
dition of the latter being put at 100. These
developed weakness in corn and the narrow
wheat market sympathized to some extent with
the drop in the coarser grains. There was some
selling by yesterday's buyers also on the fav- i
orable Northwestern crop conditions. A mod- ]
crate covering movement started at 69% c, and j
by 11 o'clock September, recovered to 69% c. j
There was some demand for export, but little
In that line was done. The market became
exceedingly dull in the last hour of the ses- I
sion, and September fell off to 69% c, where it I
closed. â â :"' â¢':'-.'
Corn was weak though moderately active.
There was general selling early on much-need
.l rains in the corn States and the Kansas
August crop report, which estimated the yield
at 400,000,000 bushels for the State. The good
shipping demand supported the market. Sep
tember closed a shade lower.
Oats were dull and fairly steady. September
closed a shade higher.
Provisions were heavy, and closed at sharp :
declines. Hog prices were lower, and this and '
the weakness of corn caused liquidation by ]
recent buyers. Packers were free sellers. At j
the Close September pork was 12% c lower, lard
7%c lower and ribs 10c lower.

HIS VALET THE
ONLY FRIEND AT
HIS DEATHBED
The Lonely Death of
Millionaire Piper.
A DISAPPOINTED RECLUSE
â . â
NEVER RECOVERED FROM AN
OLD POLITICAL DEFEAT.
Life History of an Old Mexican War
Veteran and Ex-Congressman
Who Died Yesterday at the
Palace.
Attended only by his valet, ex-Congress
man William A. Piper died shortly after
11 o'clock yesterday morning In his rooms
at the Palace Hotel. A combination of
heart failure and dropsy were the imme
diate causes of his death, though he had
been ai'.ing fro* a long time, not only from
these troubles but from a variety of mala
dies that generally attend on extreme old
age.
Mr. Piper was a native of Pennsylvania,
75 years of age. He enlisted in the army
at the time of the Mexican war and after
\ serving all through that conflict came to
this coast, where, he engaged in a variety
, of pursuits, ranging all the way from
dealings in ordinary mercantile commodi
ties to speculations in mining stocks and
real estate deals. He was an extremely
shrewd financier and left an estate in real
. property, bonds, stocks, mortgages and
' ready money amounting to over three mil
lion dollars to attest to the excellence of
his judgment in masters financial.
The millionaire was a man of strong
â  force of character, great mental power
and strong ambitions. He had a desire
to raise to the higher plane of politics and
ito that end devoted all his energies. In
â¢ 1876 he was elected to represent this dis-
I trict In Congress. Though his career
'there was fraught with honor to himself
1 and benefit to his constituents, yet when
: he ran again for a second term he was.
defeated by Horace Davis. He was a man
â¢ of great sensitiveness and took his defeat
' sorely to heart. From that time on he
'â¢withdrew entirely from public life, refus
ing to have anything more to do with
politics in any form. As the years rolled
on he also withdrew from all social life
and became more and more of a misan
thrope. For the last few years of his life
he lived almost the existence of a recluse.
Seeing no one socially save the immediate
members of his family, he withdrew en
tirely within himself, manifesting no in
terest in anything and only devoting the
time to his own business and private con
cerns that- was necessary to make them
run smoothly.
Though for many years ho had been an
invalid and though for the past few weeks
he had been actually confined to his bed,
yet his death came something as a sur
prise. Awaking yesterday morning, he
asked his valet for the morning paper and
then requested to be left alone while he
read it. The valet retired to the next
room and. returning a few minutes later
found his master a corpse, with the paper
clutched in his stiffened fingers. A sud
den spasm 'ii' the heart had attacked him
and the man of millions had gone to an
other world without the presence of a
single friend or relative by his bedside to
Witness his demise.
. The deceased saw hut little of his rela
tives, yet he was on excellent terms with
them, as will be -shown by the disposition
he made of his property in the following
â¢will. Mis real estate holdings consisted
of some valuable ranch lands in the sur
rounding counties, as well as much of the
best property in the city:
I, William A. Piper of the city and county
of San Francisco, State of California, do
make this my last will and testament,
â¢ hereby revoking all former wills made by
me:
I will and bequeath all my property, real
and personal and wheresoever situated, as
follows, to wit:
, To my nephews and nieces, share and
share alike, -he children of my deceased
brother, Edward M. Piper, one (1-7) sev
enth; to my nephews and. nieces, share and
share alike, the children of my brother.
Oliver C. Piper, two (2-7) sevenths; to my
nephews and nieces, share and share alike,
the children of my brother. Robert G. Piper.
two 2-7 sevenths: to my nephews and
nieces, share and share alike, the children
of my" deceased sister. Amanda Piper, nee
Piper, two (2-7) sevenths.
I hereby appoint and constitute William
Giselman of San Francisco and the Union

tors of this my last will and testament, and
I direct and request that no bond shall be
required from said William Giselman as
one of my said executors of this my last
[will and testament.

DR. FRYER ON THE
CHINESE SITUATION
RUSSIAN rNTLTTEJTCE MUCH
EXAGGERATED.
I
The Professor of Oriental Languages
at Berkeley Gives an Opinion
of Affairs in the
Far East.
"There is no cause for alarm in the
present state of things in China The
! political situation is quiet, foreign trade is I
i beginning to assume unlooked for propor- j
I tions, diplomatically the Government is ;
I strong and the integrity of the empire re- '
! mains unassailed." Such is the view
held by Dr. John Fryer, professor of
Oriental languages and literature in the ;
University of California, Dr. Fryer was
i one of the passengers on the Hongkong |
Maru. which arrived in San Francisco
yesterday. He has returned from a three
months' "trip to Shanghai, China, and the ;
. above is the impression of the political
1 situation in the Orient.
In an interview yesterday Dr. Fryer â 
â¢ gave the opinion that the recent trouble
in the imperial court at Peking did not 'â 
1 augur any weakness in the central Gov- .
ernnr-nt. but on the contrary showed its .
strength The relations between the Em
: press" Dowager and the young Emperor
were Quite amicable, and it was for the
best Interests of the country that the
i Empress had virtually assumed control
WM. A. PIPER.
of affairs. It was not true that the young
Emperor had been deposed. His â¢ status
corresponded to that or a minor during a
regency. The action of the Empress Dow- I
ager in setting the young ruler asirfe was
to uphold the position of the conservative
party at the imperial palace a:; against
the radicals, who were carrying out j
questionable innovations. The assump- I
tion of authority on the. part of the Em
press in setting aside the Emperor for a
few years had destroyed the foothold,
which the radicals had gained and placed
the Government upon a firm and stab.c
basis. " --"'â¢?;
With regard to the probable dismem- [
berment of- the empire and its piecing
out among the groat powers Dr. Fryer
declares emphatically that such a thing
is out of the question.
"Russia is not playing the hand that re- !
cent reports would give us to believe,"
he said. "The relations between St. Pe
tersburg and Peking need' give no cause |
for 'apprehension. The diplomatic situa- '
tion is satisfactory to the other powers .
and under, the present regime the Integ- .
rity of the country cannot help but be
maintained. Nothing but a series of re
bellions, followed by the general collapse
of the Government; could bring about dis- |
memberment. The empire Is In no danger |
of being partitioned."
When asked 'if the war In the Philip- j
pines had raised the prestige of Ameri- |
cans in the Orient in any way Dr. Fryer |
replied that the Chinese generally were I
quite Ignorant of the existence of tho i
war. The feats of American arms and I
American battleships were not widely I
known.
Trade with the Orient had taken Im- j
mense strides within the last few years. ;
In one or two articles there had been a ,
noticeable depression, hut this was coun- i
terbalanced by much heavier exports in |
other things. The manufacture of Chinese j
cotton by imported machinery was not
coming up to the expectation of the capi
talists who launched the movement. A I
corporation under the name of the Inter- j
national Cotton Factory had an extensive
plant in Shanghai and shares were held j
by the foreign residents there, but finan- j
cially the affairs of the concern were not I
promising. The same could be said of ,
other attempts to utilize the Chinese raw
material in competition with American
and English cloth.
While in China Dr. Fryer was honored
by receiving the First Order. of the Im
perial Dragon, a distinction sometimes
conferred upon foreigners by the Chinese
Government. It carries with it ail of
ficial dress with appropriate insignia.
New Tax Levy Nearly Ready.
The clerks in the office of the clerk of
the Board of Supervisors are . hard at
work upon the new tax levy, which will
be presented to the board for Its adoption
at Its meeting to-morrow afternoon. The
revised figures embrace several of the
suggestions offered by the Merchants'
Association and also several, advanced by
the Mayor, and will keep within the
dollar limit.
Fraudulent Squirrel Bounty.
J. A. Lambert, a hunter, was arrested
yesterday by Policeman Furlong on a
Justice's warrant from Merced charging
him with presenting a fraudulent
claim to the Treasurer of the county
for squirrel scalps. He was taken to
Merced last night.

/TVALIFORXIA may safely claim
I / the palm for having produced
V / "â  one of the most deadly feuds and
jT at the same time the most lively
that has ever been recorded in
this country, and probably in the world.
The telegraphic columns of the daily
papers throughout the United States
have been loaded during the past few
months with accounts of the deadly
Kentucky feuds, many of which read
liite the lurid literature of the dime
novel order. Whole families have been
wiped out of existence in a single
quarrel. These tales are interesting to
lis, mainly on account of that bit of
romance which is supposed to 'long
to the Southern people of S past gen
sratlon: for instance, the Hatfield-Mc-
Coy rffalr. An Ashland. .Wis., paper of
a recent date publishes the notice of
the death of William D. Coates. This
paper says the person was formerly a
resident of Mendocino. Cal., so he is
undoubtedly one of the children of the
family which figured in the famous
feud of 1865, when the two families
fought a battle that startled the coun
ty, even in the days when every gentle
man carried his gun and considered his
honor in his own keeping, with the
perfect right to settle all social differ
ences according to the good old South
ern code.
The vendetta referred to in this
article began ln 1565 and the great
fight occurred on the 11th of October
of that year. Thf battle, which took
place at Luttle Lake on that date, was
fought in the remarkably short period
of a quarter of a minute; over twenty
shots were fired, and when al! was over
live men were dead and another rnor
t-ally wounded, which made a total of
six "men killed in a quarter of a min
ute.
It is difficult for one in his sound
senses to imagine that men of mature
years could possibly be so bereft of rea
son as to take up the quarrel of a
coupie of children at school and carry
the same to the extent that it finally
became a deadly feud betwen two
otherwise quite respectable families.
However, it was in his manner the no
torious Mendocino vendetta began.
It lias always been considered a dif
ficult matter to get anything like a
definite account of just what did take
place on that fatal 11th day of October,
1865, so the writer takes a pardonable
pride in presenting the following story
to the readers of this paper, believing
it to be as near the truth as it is pos
sible to present such a matter so many
years after the actual occurrence.
According to local histoiy the feud
which terminated so fatally began in
the following insignificant manner: At
the district school in Little Hake Val
ley, where the children of both fami
lies "â¢'ere pupils, one of the Coates boys
had a row with the son of Mr. Frost.
The boys went out during Intermission
and tried to settle their difficulty in
true schoolboy fashion, employing the
weapons with which nature had pro
vided Vhemâ their little fists. All this
was in accordance with the time-hon
ored custom which has been recognized
ln public schools for generations, and,
under ordinary circumstances, the
trouble would have burned itself out
at the conclusion cf the mill. Unfortu
nately the teacher considered it his
duty to admonish the lads for their in
fraction of the rules, which forbade
fig on the school grounds, so the
boys were very properly flogged for the
Offense.
The parents of these urchins took it
upon themselves to admonish the
teacher for the part he had taken in
the mix-up. each declaring that his
child had received punishment for an
offense of which he was innocent. Each
argued his case In this manner: Now,
one of the boys must have been the
aggressor, consequently the other had
simply defended himself against the
unjust attack of the tyrant, and why
should both be punished for an offense
of which but one could have been
guilty?
The teacher, a sensible person, In
formed the parents of the boys that it
â was necessary in order to maintain the
discipline of the school to punish all
pupils who so far forgot themselves as
to fight on the school grounds. He con
sidered such outbursts of temper de
moralizing and a most unhealthy ex
ample to set before tne more peaceably
Inclined. Finally, one of the parents
became convinced that the teacher was
right and was quite willing to let the
matter drop, but the father of the other
boy refused to be pacified, so the mat
ter was finally taken up before the
Board of Trustees, who. after due de
liberation, concluded to -sustain the
teacher. The arguments on either side
were long and serious, for every resi
dent of the district could see that this
incipient riot was fast brewing bad
biood between the parents. In a short
time nearly every person in the town
ship had espoused the cause of one or
the other of the dissatisfied parents.
As there was no appeal from the de
cision of the board the parents were
obliged to pocket their injured pride
and one of them removed his child from
the school, but not until severe threats
had been made on either side.
The father who had taken his boy out
of school soon determined upon a new
way to get even with the teacher. The
annual election for a new Board of
Trustees was soon to take place and
he declared solemnly that oo member
of the old board should ' e-;.*r ne re
elected and as th"*- trustees] hai--? th,
privilege of appointing, the teacher th i_
threat meant that he was stitute
himself as the political boss in this
small affair, and. if successful, he cer
tainly intended having the offensive
teacher ousted from his position. The
other faction was just as determined
that the old board should be re-elected
and that the teacher he retained.
It soon became evident through the
length and breadth of he valley that
there might soon be serious trouble
over this small affair; people too easily
convinced themselves that it was no
small affair after all; that the honor of
each family was at stake.
From this period on to the bloody
conclusion dreadful threats were freely
exchanged between the two famine--,
and it is said by people who are old
residents of the district that the Frosts
registered a solemn vow that the
Coates family must her retire from
the field or the Frosts would take â¢**
upon themselves to annihilate every
male being who bore the name of
Coates. This condition of affairs re
mained unchanged up to the day of
election.
A few days previous to the election
Wesley Coates met Mr. Duncan, a
brother-in-law of the Frosts, and they
had quite a talk about their family
quarrel. each claiming the other to be
wrong In his respective opinion. warm
words were the result of this conver
sation, and, had it not been for "lends
of both parties who happened to be
present, there would in ail probability
have been a serious fight then and
there. And possibly it would have
been much better for all concerned if
these well-intentioned friends had held
their peace and left these two fire-eat
ers to their fate. It might have meant
the saving of many lives, for although
shooting was not at all uncommon up
there in those days, still the better
class of citizensâmeaning, of course,
the -ore peaceably inclinedâ were on
the lookout for the cominr trouble, and
together with the officers of the law
intended to arrest and confine the first
man who attempted a warlike move
mer.t. So, even though one or both
of these men had been killed on the
spot it is more than likely the feud
would have ended there. However, the
men were flnallv separated and â vent
their several ways, each vowing venge
ance. That night there was consid
erable talk of organizing something
like a pea society, not for the pur
pose of self-protection, for there was
not a man In the valley who was not
capable of taking care of himself In
any kind of a fight, guns preferred.
Mr. Budd gives a good description of
the shooting as it actually occurred.
He was on th.- spot, and being a news
paper man probably took a greater In
terest in the affair than many of the
witnesses who happened to be present
at the time. Mr. Budd says he was
there in the interests of his paper, not
to report the tragedy but looking out
for the business end of his paper. "I
had gone up the valley," he said, "to
see about money that was due me from
some of the business men up there. It
was a hot, uncomfortable day and we
were all seated on the porch of the ho
tel trying to keep cool. Of course, we
were on the Lookout, and anxious for
anything to relieve the dull monotony
of the situation. We had exhausted
every amusement we could think of,
and were waiting patiently for any
thing that might turn up. It was too
warm to play cards any longer, so we
concluded to sit under the shade of the
overhanging awning and calmly await
the cool of the evening. We had been
there but a short time when we noticed
a cloud of dust down the road which
meant that somebody was coming to
town This was a relief, for in those
days news . from . the outer world was
scarce, and every stranger was at least
able to tell us something we had not
heard before. We little thought, any
of us that we wore about to witness
one of the most speedy fights that ever
took plaoa in this or any othar country.
"We could calculate most accurately
about how long it would take a per
son to reach the hotel from the point
from where we had first observed the
dust. We waited for a period far ex
ceeding the time necessary to cover the
distance, but the persona had not ap
peared. '.me of our party finally re
marked that there must be something
wrong down the road or those people
would have been to the hotel some time
before. Another lounger, a resident* of
the town, suggested that it might be
some members of the Frost or Coates
family, and as this was the day for the
school election it was just possible some
trouble had occurred. We then con
cluded we would go down there and see
what might be the trouble, and if by
any chance there was to be a fight, we
were all anxious to see lt. Most of us
were strangers in the place, that is to
say, we did not reside in the town. We
had heard of the trouble between the
two families, and realized that there
might be some sort of a fight, but we
had no idea that it meant death for so
many people.
"When we reached the spot where
we had seen the dust cloud, we found
a Mr. Duncan. He was the only one
we could recognize, for the other man
had his back toward us. He was evi
dently in hot dispute with the other
man." We could hear angry words
punctuated by oaths and threats.
"At last the other man turned his
head and we recognized him as Wesley
Coates. Knowing Mr. Duncan to be
the brother-in-law of one of the Frosts,
we concluded that they were talking
over the family trouble and could not
see that we had any right to Interfere.
At this juncture Duncan said: 'Coates,
I know you did say it.*
"Coates replied: 'Duncan. I never
did.'
" 'Well. I know dâ d well you did,'
was Duncan's reply.
" 'All this talk comes from a lot of
busy people who want to see a fight,'
said Coates.
" 'Well,' answered Duncan, 'if they
depend upon such fellows as you they
will be disappointed.'
"Now, Duncan, don't be a fool," said
Coates, "I can fight when it is neces
sary. You are making a mistake In
your man."
" 'Oh, I don't know,' was the taunt
ing reply of Duncan. , â¢;,...
" 'Well, I do, and I advise you to keep
quiet. I'll get mad pretty soon,' said
Coates.
"The last remark of Duncan's seemed
to provoke Coates almost to the fight
ing pitch, and we could see that he was
using every endeavor to control him
self, which he managed to do by sheer
force of character. lam sure I never
before saw a ; man who had himself
under Such perfect control, especially
when one considers his parentage and
rearing. For your edification I will tell .
you that most of. the people who lived
in Utile Lake Valley belonged to that
branch at the Confederate army that '
never surrendered. Upon the declara
tion of peace they came across the
plains to California and many of the
families settled in Mendocino, So you
can Imagine they were far from cow
arris. Most of them would as soon
light as eat, and some of them a little
rather. All these facts taken into con
sideration, we could not help admiring
the extreme coolness of the- man. Un
der ordinary circumstances Duncan
would have been a corpse in one short
second. We knew* that Coates was
armed from the fact that he never was
known to go unarmed, in fact most
men carried weapons in that sparsely
settled country. Indians were still
pretty bad, especially a few wandering
tribes between the valleys and the
coast who had not yet been rounded up
on the reservation, and there was a
sort of unwritten law which gave every
, white, man the right to shoot an In
dian.
" 'See here,' was Duncan's next re
mark, 'you fellows have made a whole
lot of talk about what you were going
to do to the Frost family. I want you
to understand that I am one of that
family, and will tell you further that
we ire about sick of it. If you feel
like taking a hand in this fight you will
never have a better chance.'
"Coaies was as cool as a man who
had received an invitation to dine with
a friend. 'Now. Duncan,' said he. 'I
told you once before that you may go
too far with this talk. I am sure to
get mad in a minute.'
" 'Well, I don't think you would kick
up fire enough to smoke a coon out of
a hollow tree if you do,' was Duncan's
sneering reply.
" 'Duncan, shut up" yelled Coates. 'I
know what you are up to and you will
get it in a minute. And when it comes
to talk, you fellows have raid enough
about our family to land you all in jail
ln any other part of the world. I have
been told by some of the neighbors '
that you have made your brags that
you intended to send the whole Coates
family to a place where they would
never be any more trouble to anybody.
Do you suppose we are going to over
look such a bluff as that? No, sir.
You needn't get too anxious, for it's a
sure shot you will get ail the fight you
want before long.'
.".'That's all right,' said Duncan. 'I
â¢ don't say that we did -not make that
remark. But. you can .your last
dollar on one thing, if one of the Frost
boys made 'that remark we . will stay
with the game till there Is not one, of
the Coates breed left to blow about- the
. fight. I don't believe there Is a fight
ing man in the whole family.'
This was an unfortunate remark, for
at that moment Coates made a lunge
at his tormentor and before there was
any chance. to draw weapons the men
had grappled with each other and were
.atit in good manly style. We made up
our minds to let the men fight it out
and were Intensely Interested in the
' i ray, so much so, in fact, that we

scarcely heard the rush of people down
the road, but the two combatants did
and were on their feet and separated
in a moment. This is the point where
the real battle began. The new arrivals
on the field proved to be all the prin
cipals who took a hand in the fray. I
will give you a full list of their names.
"On one side were Mr. Duncan and
Martin Frost. Ish-.m Frost and Elisha
Frostâ all brothers; on the other side
were Wesley Coates, Abraham Coates,
Albert Coates, Henry Coates, Thomas
Coates, James Coates and Abner C.
Coates. Wesley Coates, Henry and
James were brothers. Abner was the
father of Albert and uncle to the three
brothers; Abraham was a cousin of all
except Thomas, who was his uncle. The
men were armed as follows: All the
Frosts and Duncan had Colt's navy re
volvers. Duncan, however, broke his
in the fight with Wesley Cerates, and
he did no shooting. Wesley Coates and
Abraham Coates had pistols and Ab
ner C Coates a double-barreled gun,
one barrel of which was rifled and the
other smooth for shot; Wesley Coates
also had a knife.
"The rest of the fight took such a
short time that it is almost Impossible
to describe it. However, I will give
you all the details possible under the
circumstances. We saw the men rush
at one another. Every mother's son
them had his weapon drawn, and when
they began firing the noise was like
a string of firecrackers being dis
charged by some improvident on a
Fourth of July. We saw Elisha Frost
fall at the first volley; he was mortally
wounded, but he laid his revolver over
his arm and kept on firing. I claim
that he killed three men after he was
practically dead, but some of the men
who were present say four. Be this as
lt may he certainly never gave up his
fusillade till the breath was well out of
his body. It was a wonderful exhibi
tion of grit and proved to us how hard
it is to kill a man who is full of fight.
"We saw Wesley Coates wielding his
knife, but it was very difficult to tell
the result. Presumably he used it on
Duncan, as he was* dangerously stab
bed and the bloody weapon which be
longed to Wesley Coates was found
near the spot where Duncan fell.
"A curious fact in connection with
this wonderful battle is that from the
time the two families met in full force
only two words were spoken. Albert
Coates was heard to exclaim "My
God!" When Elisha Frost was exam
ined it was found that he had received
at least four mortal wounds, and how
he ever managed to keep on firing is
a mystery that will never be explained.
It seems wonderful, but still It Is a
fact that this remarkable battle, In
which twenty shots were fired, occu
pied just a quarter of a minute in time.
There can be no mistake on this point,
for a man who saw none of the fight
ing, as he was too far up the road at
the time, looked at his .watch when he
heard the first shot and kept his watch
in- his hand until the whole thing .was
over. In that short Quarter of a mln
ute six men were called to settle ac
counts with their Maker. '
"We carried the dead and dying into
the public hall, laid them out as de
cently as possible and left them to
their sorrowing relatives and the Coro
ner."
Mrs. Folsome, the wife of a physi
cian who resided at Mendocino City,
gives a most graphic description of the
scene at the funeral of the victims of
this awful tragedy. This lady was re
lated to the Coates family, and her tale
of the sad event* was liberally punc
tuated with tears and sobs; in fact. It
was difficult to get anything like con
tinuity out of her disjointed statement:
"I was informed of this awful thing,"
she said, "by a man who had ridden
all night on horseback from Little
Lake to Mendocino City. His first re
mark was, 'Mrs. Folsome, your whole
family has been wiped off the face of
the earth. I am very sorry to bring
you such bad news, but it is true. Let
your husband mount his horse at once,
for he may be able to save at least one
human life.' I asked if I could not ac
company my husband, and If he could
not give me some details of the affair.
He said he had no time to give any de
tails, and that I certainly could not
accompany the doctor, as it would be
necessary to ride all night, and ride
like the devil, too.
"But I had made up my mind to g*
at all hazards. I knew that my hue
band was good and kind and would not
refuse my request. I had been trained
to ride ln my youth, and knew I could
stand any kind of hardship in that
line, so I told the stableman to saddle
a horse for me, as I Intended to ride
with the doctor.
"Our horses were brought to the door
and our guide was ready to start back
over the long, hot and dusty road
which he had just traversed.
"But this time the whole town had
heard the exciting news of the awful
murders that had occurred in the val
ley. Many of the people saddled their
horses and declared their intention to
accompany us to the scene. But my
husband was a man of wonderful
nerve, and as cool as they make them.
He decided in a moment *' at we make
the trip alone. He realized that at
least one half of the men were anxious
to go out of pure curiosity, and that if
they were allowed to do so it would
make our trip all the more uncomfort
able on account of the dust. If you

Just look at the way you do your

tne- way the Eastern iris are arrang

tment. Tliis may sound paradoxical,
but if you've ever tried it you know
â  â 
that careless effects often require a
great aval of oains.
Miss New York made a great many
mor-* remaiks about our manner of
bail dressing. Did you ever notice that
Eastern men and women never agree
about San Francisco girls'.'

"There are drugstores in San Fran
cisco," cruelly answered Miss New
York
"There isn't a woman in the audience
whose hair isn't combed after the fash
ion of at least six months ago."
Miss New York drawled out the six
months as though it were six years
and as though tie- sin of being six
i months out of fashion were the deep
est of the- cardinal transgressions.
The Harvard man was looking at the
head of a girl two rows frontâ a very
shapely head i! was, with shining
brown braids twined around it, the
hair parted in the middle and failing
softly over the ears.
"Don't you think that looks rather
well lie asked timidly.
Miss New York followed his eyes.
"That," -;--â  said in sorrowful under
tone, 'that's a relic of dead and buried
fashions. It's almost creepy, lika see
ing a ghost from the past. Most of
them at least wear the pompadour."
The girl who gave Miss New York
the "creeps" happened to look around.
She was a breathing Image of the Ma
donna. The hair parted in the middle
and combed smoothly back showed a
low, broad, white forehead. The con
tours of her face were Oriental â of
the finest development cf that type.
"It suits her don't care whether it's
the go or not." said the Harvard man.
The curtain went up with Hope Boss
in the center of the si age.
"There." said Miss New York, "there
âthat's the real thing. That's the way
to comb the hair."
Back in her dressing room Miss Ross
was Informed that she had met the
approval of -Miss New York. She was
asked whether she, too, considered it
p. heinous crime on the part of San
Francisco girls to dress their hair ac
cording to their own ideas and well,
you can read the answer which she has
writti n for yourself.
There are some things which loyal
San Franciscans never confess. There
is the fog, for Instance. 'Twere rank
heresy to confess its existence except
ing to near relatives And then, though
we whisper it low and it pricks, 'tis a
fact that fashions arrive here several
months after they have sprouted and
blossomed in the East.
We don't object to having our sins
of omission laid at the door of orig
inality. But there are some of its who
have a suspicion that it's really be

Now, thanks to these photographs,
you can see just how those who are
close to the throne of Fashion are
arranging their locks. If you would fol
low in their wake you may do so.
Perhaps lt is better to give in grace
fully in the beginning â we laughed at
hoop skirts, scorned bustles and
fiouted the idea of small sleeves. But
we all came to them sooner or later.
If you would come to this sooner,
these photographs will give you the
cue. This is the way Mrs. Leslie Car
ter, Minnie Madden. Fiske and half of
the Eastern feminine world are wear
ing their hair.
You must not use a rat. The pompa
dour must not form an even halo. It
must part carelessly on one side and
gracefully over the forehead on the oth
er. The hair must _0t be knotted be

peep over it.
But, above all, as Miss Ross says, it
must suit your style of beauty.
By Hope Ross.
â jj* SENT one of these pictures to
brother Tom. I suppose some of you
,1 remember him played leading ju
venile out here one season with Fraw
ley. Here are some of the sweet things
he wrote in reply:
"Hope, dear, is it really hope â less?"
This Is a fair sample of Tommy's wit.
"Hope, dear, I know you're proud and
haughty (so am I), but if you've had to
part with your silver-back brush and
comb (so have I), why didn't you bor
row from the photographer?"
I take this public way of telling
brother Tom that if he used his two
eyes more an. his speaking apparatus
less, he'd knew that half the girls in
that part of Christendom bounded by
New York, lost. m and Chicago are
wearing their hair after this fashion,
which broth-:- Tom calls "human com
bination feather duster and mop."
I really think it rather funny, though,
that I should b( asked to illustrate and
write an article 'â¢.hat hangs on the hair.
I used to keep all my press notices.
When I first wet" on the stage I made
up my mind to tigest every morsel of
advice offered b_ the critics. I didn't
realize then that he critics are not all
of a mind. Not a fÂ»w of them have seen
fit to comment on my hair or manner
of dressing it. Their comments, how
ever, do not fit.
At the suggestion of one I have aban
doned curls; no soÂ»ner done than an
other cries out agiinst the braid; I
have combed my h-.ii- back from my
forehead, I have let t fall down to my
eyes. Perhaps I mi-jht have pleased
either were 'tcthc-r deir critic away.
All this was several seasons gone. I
don't save press notices now. I do my
hair in the manner I th nk most becom
ing. The latest sin inked among my
failings Is that of dyeing my hair red.
I did wear auburn locks in the "Danc
ing Girl." Some one objected, in print,
that my golden locks had been sub
jected to the auburn hue if the per
son will send me a self-addressed and
stamped envelope I wil give the
address of the wigmaker vho so cun
ningly devised the Titian wig that it
defied critics' detection.
Actresses find it very difficult to keep
their hair at its best. Before going on
the stage their hair may hav-* been as
beautiful as Janette's:
It was brown with a golden jrloss. Janette;
It was finer than silk of the floss, my pet:
'Twas a beautiful mist falling <\>wn to
your wrist,
'Twas b thing to be braided and jeweled
and kiss
'Twas th.- loveliest hair in the worll. my
pet.
Janette never was on the stage ,r I
miss my guess. Any number of ac
tresses have -- ely hair, but the "love
liest hair in the world, my pet," would
rebel at the misuse that the stage re
quires. Hair may be "a thing to be
braided and jeweled and .kissed." but
it was never meant to be made a night
ly slave of the curling tongs and
dressed in every style from Topsy to
Mary, Queen of Scots.
We are constantly told that the peo
ple like us best in our own hair, and
as we try to please the public we
eschew wigs as often as possible. The
result is that we often ruin our own
hair.
As for this latest way of doing the
hair. It is really very popular in the
East. A great many people are at
tempting it, and thereby making caric
atures of themselves. The hair must
be unusually fine and soft if it is
combed in this fashion: moreover, it
must suit the face. Imagine a woman
with glasses wearing her hair in this
style! I can't think of anything fun
nier, unless it be myself playing
tragedy.
It looks easy, but really it is harder
to comb your hair this way than in a
severe style. You have to be careful
not to comb over the lineâ and it's finer
than a hairâ that separates the artistic
from the slovenly. You must study the
effect, fore and aft, as our sailor
friends put it. It may lock very well
in front, while in the back the hair is
all a-straggle with that ragged ap
pearance that proclaims the use of one
mirror Instead of two.
If the face is meant for a careless
framework of hair, I think this is
a very pretty style. It would suit any
number of girls in San Francisco. I
doubt not this fashion will soon travel
westward h-:
The girls here don't play "follow
your leader" unless it pleases them to.
And it pleases me to think that they
are just right. HOPE ROSS.ONE TIME FUNSTON

"I went to school with Fred Funsi i

last evening. "We were fellow scholars
at the old Lawrence University at Law

then, so I take it that be is now in the
neighborhood of 34. I entered the fresh
man class when he was a junior, but
class lines were not very distinctly drawn
then, socially, and we got to be great
friends. As I remember him in those
days he was a thin, sickly looking little
fellow, homely as a rail fence and cov
ered with freckles. He was overflowing
with spirits, however, and really had a
cast-iron constitution. When Funs ton ar
rived at the university he was given a
rather severe hazing, which he took at
the outset with great good nature, hut
when they tried to strip him fur a duck

the ceremony, he wriggled loose, darted
into the hall and led the whole crowd a
merry chase all over the dormitory. i hey

was never ducked, and after that was a
leader in practical jokes himself. One of
the preceptors was very nervous, and
Funston had great fun with him by pre

he would go into hideous contortions, ap

and the professor, infuriated, would pass
lt on to the next. Altogether, however,
he was a good student and a downright
good fellow. The last time I saw him he
was lecturing, just before he got his com

well; but he was restless and discontent

in exactly his element."

tended to go at any rate, and they
would like so see anybody stop them.
My husband soon found a very effect
ual way to do so. He drew his revol
ver and promised to kill the first man
who tried to follow our little cavalcade.
We then mounted and started on our
long ride, my husband riding behind
with his pistol in his hand. Not a man
attempted to follow us, for each knew
the doctor's determined character.
"With a cut of the lash of our bridle
reins our little mustangs started on
their lons run for the valley. We had
nothing but mustangs in those days,
and a hardier breed of stock it would
be difficult to find in the world. Our
courier had been supplied with a fresh
horse and had taken the precaution to
have another animal turned loose in
the road which we were to "drive ahead
of us in case one of our mounts be

more of the details of that awful ride.
Like all things, it came to an end at

The Heliograph
and What It
Can Do.
The heliograph, under present condi
tions, can be used only during hours of
sunshine, but on bright days its trans
mitted signals are so quickly displayed
and promptly read at any reasonable dis
tance that it replaces the flag on all pos
sible service. Dust and smoke which
would completely obscure the largest flag
are readily penetrated by the flash of Â» the
heliograph. Under ordinary conditions
this 'flash is visible to the naked eye at
distances of thirty miles, but with a tel
escope of thirty powers can be Been nearly
200 miles. The military value of the helio
graph was strikingly Illustrated in the
successful campaign of General N. A.
Miles against Geronimo, a campaign that
put an end to the Indian outbreaks that
for twenty years devastated Arizona with
ts horrible" accompaniments of murder
and rapine. . _ â__ , ...
General Miles said: "The hostiles
found troops In every valley, and when
they Â«aw heliograph communication flash
in* across every mountain range Geroni
mo and others, who had already surren
dered, sent word to Natchez that he had
better come in at once.'' and he did. The
distance to which heliographs could be
worked was tested under the supervision
of Major W J. Volkmar in Arizona in
IS9O when he established a system aggre
gating 2000 miles in length. Ranges of S3,
88 95 and 121 miles were successfully
worked over. Previously the world's' record
was that between Mauritius and Reunion,
where mirrors of 1200 Inches of reflecting
surface, costing over $15,000, transmitted
messages 117 miles. This was now sur
passed by a signal corps mirror of barely
twenty inches' surface, costing $40. These
operations indicate the mechanical skill
and deftness of manipulation of American
instruments and by American operators.
The most astonishing feat of long-dis
tance heliographing by the Signal Corps
was that accomplished by Captain W. A.
Glassford. September 7, 1896. With a
standard instrument of the Signal Corps,
a station heliograph eight inches square,
messages were sent and received between
Mount Ellen. Utah, and Mount Uncom
pahgre Colorado, an air line distance of
no less than 183 miles. This exceeded by
fifty-eight miles the world's record. The
great difficulty in establishing very long
ranges consists in selecting points of
such elevation as is necessary to over
come the convexity of the earth. Cap
tain Glassford says: '"v\ hen we caught
the first glimmer of the Mount Ellen flash
lt appeared through the telescope a deep
reddish hue. It was about as bright as
the planet Venus and with the same ap
parent disk as presented by that plant in
our glasses."â General A. W. Greely in

Wedding of George Tubou,
King of Tonga.
. The Sunday Call presents herewith the first photograph taken of
King George Tubou of Tonga and his bride, Lavinia, formerly daughter of
the Minister of Police. It was -the desire of many of the chiefs that
George should marry Ofa, a very high chieftainess from "Niua Tobu
Tabu," to whom he had been betrothed from childhood. Bet the King
was pleased to marry his heart's choice and elevate the daughter of the
Minister of Police to h:*s own high rank. Me made an entirely new de=
parture from 1 organ customs by publicly placing a bright golden crown
upon his bride's head as she knelt before him after the wedding 'cere
mony, and, raising her from the ground, said in a clear voice. --Lavinia,
I crown thee Queen of Tonga." He further broke all well-established con
ventionality by insisting that his bride sit by his side to partake of the
wedding breakfast, a proceeding diametrically opposite to Tongan religion,
for man and wife never are supposed to partake of food together, the men
of the family eating in one part of the home and the women in another.
But King George thought otherwise, and no one dared gainsay him. Long
live the King. '
gled their tears. Their cries and lamen
tations could be heard for a distance
of fifty yards from the building. My
husband, insisting that I remain out
side the building for a few minutes,
rushed in to see if it were possible to
do anything to comfort the poor
creatures, who were far beyond the
aid of human science. He soon re
turned and asked me if I was sure I
could witness the sight within the
building. I assured him that I was
prepared for anything, so he put his
arm around my waist and half car

look upon the cold faces of their dead.
Up to this time the bodies had not been
washed, for like most country people
they believed they had no right to dis
turb a body until the proper authori
ties had arrived and given legal per
mission. By the side of each corpse
were from two to five half-crazed
mourning relatives. Many of the fran
tic women called in vain to their hus
bands to speak, while one poor widow
sat bathing her dead husband's face
with a handkerchief, which she damp
ened from a glass of water which had
been brought to revive her from a
swoon into which she had fallen when
she first entered the hall. This poor
creature had no fear of the law. and I
am sure if she had had the strength
she would have carried that poor piece
of clay to her home. I went to her
side and told her that I too had lost
a dear cousin, and asked her to be
brave. I told her it was useless to
carry on in that manner, for all her
tears could never bring the dead to
life.
"The poor distracted creature looked
at me with that fierce expression so
common in animals when they are
driven to bay. 'So you have lost a
cousin, have you? What does a cousin
amount to? You may have fifty
cousins, but you could have but one
dear husband. I had one. but now he
lies cold in death and I am left here
all alone in this dreary world. No,
good woman. I do not need your sym
pathy, for you cannot understand my
feelings. I* know you mean well, but
all I ask is to be left alone with my
dead husband.
A strange fact in conjunction with
the whole affair was the peculiar ef
fect this grewsome result seemed to
have produced in the minds of all the
remaining members of the two families.
To be sure there was little left of
mine. "But the fact remains that the
relatives" of both families walked about
as if there could be no thought of re
venge, and none of them seemed to
have the least fear of the others.
After so severe a battle one would al
most imagine that retaliation would
have been uppermost in the minds of
some of them. Evidently they all
thought that there had been fighting
enough for one day and had concluded
to declare a sort of truce. With their
henchmen things were quite different,
they said all kinds of ugly things, some
of them declaring speedy vengeance in
the near future. These people were
soon silenced by the cooler heads, who
told them the row was settled and that
they had better go to their homes like
peaceable men and leave family mat
ters to be settled by the families them
selves. Good sense finally prevailed.
The people of Little Lake enjoyed a
long period of peace and quiet after
this tragedy, and it was at least fifteen
years later before either of these fam
lies ere heard of again in a public way.
About that time a gang of young men
had committed a lot of depredations in
the way of small thefts. Barns and
hen roosts were being raided nightly,
and when patience ceased to be a vir
tue the farmer-* determined to catch the
offenders, which they succeeded in do
ing. Three young fellows were caught
in the very act of stealing a set of har
ness. They were turned over to the con
stable and locked up in a room over
which a strong guard was placed and it
was the intention of the people to give
them a fair trial next day.
That night a number of the citizens
all wearing masks went to the place
where the men were confined and de
manded their release. The posse was
so strong that the guards were power
less and were compelled to give up
their prisoners. The culprits were
taken to a bridge which spanned a
stream just outside the town. They
were given five minutes in which to
make their peace with God, ropes were
then produced and they were told to
prepare for death. Everything was
conducted in a quiet and orderly man
ner. There was no evidence of malice
or revenge in their actions. Each man
considered that he was doing his duty.
Only one man seemed to show any
agitation, and he was one of the regu
lators. It was noticed that this one
masked figure was at war with his
feelings. He stood leaning un the rail
of the' bridge while the solemn prepara
tions were being made. Finally one of
his companions whispered something
into his ear. "I know, I know," was
his reply. "Well, I refuse to save a
thief. Swing him off."
In the morning the lifeless bodies of
the three young men were found dang
ling from the rail of the bridge. One
of the unfortunates belonged to a
younger generation of the Frost family.
Some of the good people of Little Lake
declare to this day that the leading reg
ulator was a Frost, and an uncle to
the boy he ordered hanged.

CHAPTER I.
A R.TORY walked pensively along the hall. In tne cool shadows
made by the palms on the window ledge her face wore the ex
/ I 1 l res-ion of thoughtful melancholy expected on th< -faces of the
ill devotees who pace in cloistered gloom. She halted before a
I 1 * door at the end of the hall and laid her hand on the knob. She
I 1 stood hesitating, her head bowed. It was evident that this mis
" " sion was to require great fortitude.
At as she opened the door. "Father," she began at once, There was
disclosed an elderly, narrow-faced man seated at a large table and sur
rounded by manuscripts and books.
Her father looked up quickly with an ogrish sec -.%;. "Go away, be
cried in a rage. "Go away. (Set out." He seemed en the point of arising
to eject the visitor. It was plain to her that he had been interrupted in
the writing of one of his sentences, ponderous, solemn and endless, in which
wandtr.d multitudes of homeless and friendless prepositions, adjective*.
looking for a parent, and quarreling nouns, sentences which no longer
symbolized the language form of thought, but which had about tmm a
quaint aroma from the dens of long-dead scholars. "Get oat," snarled
the professor. -',~ _ 1_ , '_.
"Father,"' faltered the girl. Either because bis formulated thought
was now completely knocked out of his mind by his own emphasis in de
fending it, or because he detected something of portent in her expression,
his manner suddenly changed, and with a petulant glance at his writing
i*., laid down his pen and sank back in ids chair to listen. "Well, what is
it my cbi'd?"
' 'I fie girl took a chair near the window and gazed out upon tbe snow
stricken campus, where at the moment a group of students return ng
from a classroom were festively hurling snowballs. "I've got something
important to tell you, father," said she, "but I don't quite know now to

thing important could be connected with them filled his mind with a
capricious interest. "Well, what is it. Marjory?"
Sh.- replied mlv, "Rufus Coleman wants to marry me.
"What?" demanded the professor loudly. "Rufus Coleman. What do;
The girl glanced furtively at him. She did not seem to be able to frame
a As' for The professor, he had. like all men both thoutrhtless and thought
had, like a" ightless ai
ful "told himself hat ecu.- day his daughter would come to him with a tale
of 'this kind. He had never forgotten that tho little girl was to be a
woman and he had never forgotten that this tall, lithe creature; the pres
ent Marjory, was a woman. He had been entranced an-1 confident or
entranced and aporehensive, according to the time. A man focused upon
Bstronoi the pig market or social progression, may nevertheless leave h
eooon.larv mind which hovers like a spirit over his dahlia tubers and
dream* upon the mystery of their slow and tender revelations. The pro
fessor's seeondarv mind had dwelt always with his daughter and watched
with a faith and' delight the changing to a- woman of a certain fat and
mumbling babe. However, he now saw .is machine, this self-sustaining,
self-operative love, which bad run with the ease of a clock, suddenly
crumble to ashes and leave the mind of a great scholar staring nt a
cr.lamitv "Rufus Coleman;" he repeated, stunned, Here was his daughter
very obviously desirous of marrying Rufus Coleman. "Marjory, ho cried.
in amazement and fear, "what possesses you? Marry Rufus Coleman?
The girl seemed to feel a strong sense of relief at hi prompt recogni

tlon she simply hung her head nd blushed impressively. A hush fell upon
them The professor stared long at his daughter. The shadow of unhrp-.

He had tramped heroically upon his panic and devoted his strength to
bringing thought into me kind of attitude toward this terrible fact. "1.

"\Vl*v do you wish to marry this man? You; with your opportunities of

walked nervously to ami fro. his hands flying in the air. He was very red
behind tho ears. 'as when in the classroom some student otfended him. "A

a witless knave who edits the Sunday .edition of a great outrage upon our

my house andâ" ' ' â¢ , ,',_
He became aware that bis daughter was regarding him coldly. I
thought we had i est have all this part of it over at once." she narked.
He confronted her in a new kind of surprise. Th" little -keen-eyed pro
fessor was at this time imperial: on the verge of a majestic outburst. "Be
still " he said. "Don't be clever with your father.. Don't be a dodger. Or
if you are don't speak of it to me. I suppose this fine young man expects
to see me personally?" ,- â¢ '.
"110 was coming to-morrow," replied Marjory. She began to weep.
"He was coming to-morrow."
"I'm." said the professor. He continued his pacing while Marjory
-.-,-.,,, with her head bowed to the arm of the chair His brow made the
three dark vertical crevices well known to his students. Sometimes he
glowered murderously at the photographs of ancient temples which
adorned the walls. "Mv poor child." he said once, as he paused near her,
"â o think I never knew] vou were a fool. I have been deluding myself. It
has been my fault quite as much as it lias been yours. I will not readily
forgive myself." . V ' -.
The girl raised her face and looked at him. Finally, resolved to ois
regard the dfehevelment wrought by tears, she presented a desperate front
with her wet eves and flushed cheeks. Her hair was disarrayed. "I don't
....... you can call me a fool." she said. The pause before this sentence
had boon so portentous of a wild nd rebellious speech thai the professor
almost laughed now. Rut still the father for the first time knew that he
was being undauntedly faced by his child in his own library, in the pres
ence of "72 pages of the book that was to be his masterpiece. At the back
of his mind he felt a great awe as if his own youthful spirit had come
from the past and challenged him with a glance. For a moment he was
almost a defeated man. Ho dropped Into a chair. "Does your mother
know of this?" he asked mournfullyJ . *..
"Yes." replied the girl, "she knows. She has been trying to make mc
give up Rufus."
" 'Rufus.' " cried the professor, rejuvenated by anger.
"Weli. his name is Rufus." said the girl.
"*_ please don't call him so before me." said the father with icy
dlgnity. "I do not recognize him as being named Rufus! That is a con
tention of yours which does not arouse my interest I know him very well
ns a gambler and a drunkard, and If Incidentally he is named Rufus I fail
to see any imicortanee to it."
"He is riot a gambler and he Is not a drunkard," she said.
"I'm. V.c drinks heavilyâ that is well known. He gambles. He plays
cards for moneyâ more limn lie possessesâ at least he did when he was in
college." .:'., â ...':-,.
"You said you liked him when he was in college."
"So I did. So 1 did," answered the professor sharply. "I often find
myself liking that kind of a boy in college. Don't I know themâ those lads
with their beer and their poker games, in the dead of the night, with a
towel hung over the keyhole? Their habits are often Vicious enough, but
something remains in them through it all and "they may go away and do
groat things. This happens. We know it. It happens with confusing in
sistence. It destroys theories. Thereâ there isn't much to say about it.
And sometimes we like this kind of a boy better than we no tin the
others. For my part know of many a pure, pious and fine-minded student
that I have positively loathed from a personal point of view. But," he
added; "this Rufus Coleman, his life in college and his life since go to
prove how often we get off the track. There is no gauge of collegiate
conduct whatever until we can get evidence of the man's work in the
world. Your precious scoundrel's evidence is now all in and he is a fail
ure, or worse."
"Yon are not habitually so fierce In judging people." said the girl.
"] would I' 1 if they all wanted to marry my daughter." rejoined the pro
fessor. . "Rather than let that man make love to youâ even be within a
short railway journey of you, I'll carl you 'iff to Europe this winter and
keep you 1 bore until you forget. If you persist in this silly fancy I shall
nt once becc'ine- medieval."
Marjory had .evidently recovered much of her composure. "Yes, father,
now climatos are always supposed to cure one," she- remarked with a
hint! of lightness.
"It isn't so much the obi expedient." said the professor musingly, "an
It is that 1 would be afraid to leave you here with no protection against
that drinking gambler and gambling drunkard."
"Father. I have to ask you not tic use such terms In speaking of the
man that 1 shall marry."
There was a silence. To all intents tli-> professor remained unmoved.
He smote the tips of ids fingers thoughtfully together. "Ve â es," he ob
served, "that sounds reasonable from your standpoint." His eyes studied
her face In a long and steady glance. He arose and went into the hall.
"When he returned he wore bis hat and great coat. 11.- took a book and
some papers from the tab!-- and went away.
Marjory walked slowly through the halls and up to her room. From
a window she could set her father making his way across the campus
laboriously against the wind and whirling snow. She watched It. thin
little black figure, bent forward, natlenl steadfast. It was an inferior
fact that her father was one of the famous scholars of the generation.
To her he was now a little- '.hi man facing the wintry winds. Recollecting
herself n.nd Riifus Coleman she began to weep again, wailing amid the
ruins of her tumbled hopes. Her skies had turned to paper and her trees
were more 1 its of green sponge. But amid all this woe appeared the little
hint Im.-f~ of her father making its way against the storm.
CHAPTER IT.
Tn a high-walled corridor of one of he college buildings a crowd of stu
dents waited amid stlingn and of a loud buzz of talk, Suddenly a huge
pair of doors flew open and a wedge of young men inserted itself boister
ously and deeply into the throng. There was a great scuffle attended Ly
a general banging of books upon heads. The two lower classes engaged
in herculean play, while members of the two higher classes, standing aloof,
devoted themselves strictly to the encouragement of whichever party for
a moment lost ground or heart. This was in order to prolong the conflict.
The combat, waged In the desperation of proudest youth, waxed hot
nrd hotter. The wedge bad been Instantly smitten Into a kind of block of
men. It had crumpled Into an irregular square and on three sides It was
now assailed with remarkable ferocltv. â -
It was a matter of wall meet wall In terrific rushes, during which lads
could feel their very hearts leaving them in the compress of friends and
foes. They on the outskirts upheld the honor of their classes by squeezing
ACTIVE
SERVICE
into paper thickness the lungs of those of their fellows who formed the
center of the melee. "
In some Way it resembled a panic at a theater.
The first lancelike attack, of the sophomores had been formidable, but
the fresh-men' outnumbering their enemies and smarting from continual
Bophomofic oppression, had swarmed to the front like drilled collegians
and given the arrogant fOe the first serious check of the year Therefore
the tall Gothic windows which lined one side of the corridor looked down
upon as incomprehensible and enjoyable a tumuli as could mark the steps
of advanced education. The seniors and juniors cheered themselves 111.
Long freed from the joy of such meetings, their only means for this kind
of recreation was to 'involve the lower classes, and they bad never seen
tho victims fall to with such vigor and courage. Bits of printed leaves,
torn note books, dismantled collars and cravats, all floated to the floor
beneath the feet of the warring hordes. There were no blows; It was a
battle of pressure; it was a deadly pushing Where the leaders on either
side often suffered the most cruel and sickening agony caught thus be
tween phalanxes of shoulders, with friend as well as foe contributing to
the rain. . ,
Charge after charge of freshmen heat upon the now compact and or
ganized'sophomores. Then finally the rock began to give slowly away. A
roar came from the freshmen and they hurled themselves in a frenzy upon
their betters. . , ' , "â  , . Â, J*"?',,
To be under the gaze of the juniors and seniors is to be in sight of all
men and so the sophomores at this Important moment labored with the
desperation of the half-doomed to stem the terrible freshmen. .
In the kind of game it was the time when bad tempers came strongly to
the front and in many sophomores' minds a thought arcs.- of the incom
parable insolence of the freshmen.. A blow was struck; an infuriated soph
omore had .swung an arm high and smote a freshman.
Although it had seemed that no greater noise could be made by the
given numbers the'din that succeeded this manifestation surpassed every
thing The- â  iors and seniors Immediately set up an angry howl. These
veteran classes projected themselves into the middle of th- fight, buffeting
everybody with small thought as to merit. This method of bringing peace
was 'as militant is a>; landslide; but they had much trouble before they
could separate the central lump of antagonists Into its parts. A score of
freshmen had cried out. "11 was Coke. Coke punched him. Coke/ A
ciozen'of them were tempestuously endeavoring to register their protest
against fisticuffs by means of '.am Introduction of mon fisticuffs.
The upper classmen were swift, harsh and hard. "Come. new. â .-â ' â '.â â â ,

1*),... meetings 'â  ween the lower classes at the door of a recitation
room were accounted t,:uite comfortable and idle affairs, and a blow de
livered openly and in hatred fractured a sharply defined rule of conduct.
The corridor was In a hub-bub. Many seniors and iuniors. bursting from
old and iron discipline; wildly clamored that ---Tne freshman should he
given the privilege of a single encourter w-th Coke. The freshmen hcra
selves were frantic. They besieged the tight and dauntless circle of men
that encompassed Coke. None red confront the seniors openly, hut by
headlong rushes at auspicious moments they tried to t-onv> to nuarters
with the rings of dark-browed sonhomoreps. It was no longer a festival,
a game: it was a riot. Coke, wbd-eved. pallid w'th fury, a ribbon of blood
on hi chin, swayed In the middle of the moh of his classmates, comrades
ho waived the ethics of th.> blow under the circumstance of being obliged
as a corps to stand against the scorn of the whole college, as well as
against the tremendous assn'dts of the freshman. Shamed by their own
man. but knowing full well the right t-me ard the wrong time for a pala
ver of regret ancl disavowal, this battalion Ftru-iglrd in the desperation of
despair. Once they were upon 'he --ergo of making unholy campaign

their prowess was ripe to enable them to amply revenge what was, accord
ing to their standards, an execrable deed by a man who had not the virtue
to play the rough game, but was obliged to resort to uncommon methods.
In short, the freshmen were a.Tnost out of control, and the sophomores,
debased but defiant, were Quite out of control. The senior and junior
classes, which In American colleges dictate in these affrays, found their
dignity toppling, and In consequence there was a sudden oncome of the
entire force of upper classmen, football players naturally in advance. All
distinctions were dissolved at once in a general fracas. The stiff and still
Gothic windows surveyed a scene of dire carnage.
Suddenly a voice rang brazenly through the tumult. It was not loud,
but it was different. "Gentlemen! Gentlemen!" Instantly there wan a
remarkable number of baitings, abrupt replacements, quick changes. Pro
fessor Wainwright stood at the door of his recitation room, looking into
the eyes of each member of the mob of three hundred. "Ssh!" said the
mob. "Ssh! Quit! Stop! It's the Embassador! Stop!" He had once been
Minister of Austria-Hungary, and forever now to the students of the col
lege his name was Embassador. He stepped into the corridor, and they
cleared for him a little respectful zone of floor. He looked about him
coldly. "It seems quite a general dishevelmcnt. The sophomores display
an energy in the halls which 1 do not detect in the classroom." A feeble
murmur of appreciation arose from the outskirts of the throng. While he
had been speaking several remote groups of battling men had been vio
lently signaled and suppressed by ether students. The professor gazed
into the terraces of faces that were still Inflamed, "I needn't say that 1
am surprised." he remarked In the accepted rhetoric ci' his kind. He
added musingly: "There seems to be a great deal of torn linen. Who Is
the young gentleman with blood on his chin?" :â¢;.".
The throng moved restlessly. A manful silence, such as might be In
the tombs of stern and honorable knights, fell upon the shadowed corridor.
The subdued rustling had fainted to nothing. Then out of the crowd
Coke, pale and desperate, delivered himself.
"Oh, Mr. Coke," said the professor, "I would bo glad if you would tell
the gentlemen they may retire to their dormitories." He waited while the
students passed out to the campus.
The professor returned to his room for some books, and then began his
own march across the snowy campus. The wind twisted his coat-tails fan
tastically, and he was obliged to keep one hand firmly on the ftp of his
hat. When he arrived home he met his wife in the hall. "I_ook here,
Man." he cried. She followed him into the library. "Look here," he said
"What Is this all about? Marjory tells me she wants to marry Rufus.
Coleman." :.
Mrs. Wainwright was a fat woman, who was said to pride herself upon
being very wise and If necessary sly. In addition she laughed continually
in an inexplicably personal way. which apparently made everybody who
heard her feel offended. Mrs. Wainwright laughed.
"Well." said the professor, bristling, "what do you mean by that?"
"Oh, Harris," she replied. "Oh. Harris."
The professor straightened in his chair. "I do not see any illumination
in those remarks. Mary. I understand from Marjory's manner that 3he la
bent upon marrying Rufus Coleman. She said you knew of It."
"Why, of course I know. It was as plainâ"
"Plain!" scoffed. the professor. "Plain!" -:.
"Why, of course," she cried. "I knew it all along."
There-was nothing in her tone which proved that she admired the --vent
itself. She was evidently carried away by tho triumph a* her penetration
"I knew it all alone" she Â£>dt*et_ nodding
THE SUNDAY CALL.
The professor looked at her affectionately. "You knew it all along,
then, Mary? Why didn't you tell me, dear?"
"Because you ought to have known it," she answered blatantly.
The professor was glaring. Finally he spoke in tones of grim reproach.
"Mary, whenever you happen to know anything, dear, it seems only a mat
ter of partial recompense that you should tell me."
The wife had been taught in a terrible school that she should never
invent any inexpensive retorts concerning bookworms, and so she yawned at
once. '.'Really. Harris. Really, I didn't suppose the affair was serious.
You could have knocked me down with a feather. Of course he has been
here very often. but then Marjory gets a great deal of attention. A great
deal of attention." _^ ,
The professor had been thinking. "Rather than let my girl marry that
scallawag ill take you and her to Greece this winter with the class, .repa
ration. it is a sure cure that has the sanction of antiquity."
"Well.' said Mrs! Wainwright, "you know best. Harris. You know
best." It was a common remark with her, and it probably meant either
approbation or disapprobation if it did not mean simple discretion.
CHAPTER 111.
There had been a babe with no arms born in one of the western
counties of Massachusetts. In place of upper limbs the child had growing
from Its chest a pair of finlike hands] mere hits .if skin-covered bone. Fur
thermore, it had only one eve. This phenomenon lived four days, but the
news of the birth had traveled up this country road and through that vil
lage until it reached the ears of the editor of the MlchaelstoWn Tribune.
He was also a correspondent of the New York Eclipse. On the third day
he appeared at the home of the parents accompanied by a photographer.
While the latter arranged Ids Instrument the correspondent talked to the
father and mother, two cow-eyed and yellow-faced people, who seemed
to suffer a primitive fright of the strangers. Afterward, as the corre
spondent and the photographer were climbing into their buggy, the mother
crept furtively down to the gate and asked in a foreigner's dialect if they
would send Her a copy of the photograph. The correspondent, carelessly
indulgent, promised it. As the buggy swung away the father came from
behind an apple tree, and the two somi-humans watched it with its bur
den of glorious strangers until it rumbled across the bridge and disap
peared The correspondent was elate; he told the photographer that the
Eclinse would probably pay fifty dollars for th.- article and the photograph.
The office of the New York Eclipse was at the top of the immense
building on Eroadwav. It was a sheer mountain, to the heights of which
>.. Interminable thunder of the streets arose faintly. The Hudson was a
broad rath of silver in the distance. its edge was marked by the tracery
of sailing ships' rigging and by the buire and many-colored stacks of ocean
liners At the foot of the cliff lav City Hall Park. It seemed no larcer
than a nullt The gray walks patterned the snow covering into triangles
and ovals and upon them many tiny people scurried here and. there with
out sound like a fish at the bottom of a pool. It was only the vehicle*
that sent high unmistakable, the deep bass of their movement. And yet
after listening one seemed to hear a singular murmurous note, a pulsation,
as if the crowd made noise by its mere living, a mellow hum of the eternal
strife Then suddenly out of the deeps might ring a human voice, a news
bo v shout: perhaps, the cry of a faraway jackal at night.
From the level of the erdlnarv roofs, combined In. many plateaus, dotted
with short iron chlmnevs from which curled wisps of am. arose other
mountains like the Eclipse building. They were great peaks, ornate, glit
tering with paint or polish. Northward they subsided to sun-crowned
From some of the windows of the Eclipse office dropped the walls of a
terrible chasm, in the darkness of wbich could be seen vague struggling
figures. Looking down Into this appalling crevice one discovered only the
tons of hat-* and knees which in spasmodic jerks seemed to touch the rlm-
of the hats. The scene represented some weird fight or dance or carouse.
It was not an exhibition of men hurrying along a narrow street. _â > -
It â¢>*- good to tun- one's eves from that place to the vista of the city 9
snlr-ndid reaches with spire und shining In the clear atmosphere and
the marvel of the Jersey shore, pearl-misted or brilliant with detail. I' rom
this height the sweep of a snowstorm was defined and majestic. Even a
Blight summer shower, with swords of lurid yellow sunlight piercing its
edges as if warriors were contesting every foot of its advance, was from
the Eclipse office something so inspiring that the chance pilgrim felt a
sense of exultation as if from this peak he was surveying the world wide
war of the elements and life. The staff of the Eclipse usually worked with
out coats ana amid the smoke from pipes. /
To one of the editorial chambers came a photograph and am article
from Michaelstown. Mass. A boy placed the packet and many others upon
the desk of a young man who was standing before a window and thought
fully drumming upon the pane. He turned at the thudding of the packets
upon ois desk. "Blast you," be remarked amiably. "01. _ guess It won't
hurt you to work," answered the boy. grinning with >. comrade's insolence.
Baker, an assistant editor for the Sunday paper, took his seat at his desk
and began the task of examining th" packets. His face could not display
any particular interest because he had been at the same work for nearly
a fortnight.
The first long envelope he opened was from a woman. There was a
neat little manuscript accompanied by a letter which explained that the
writer was a widow who was trying to make her living by her pen and
who, further, hoped that the generosity of the *-dltor of the Eclipse would
lend him to give her article the opportunity which she was sure it deserved.
She hoped that the editor would pay her as well as possible for it, as she
needed the money great! v. She added that her brother was a reporter .in
tha Little Rock Sentinel and he had declared that her literary style was
â¢< [lent.
Baker really did not read this note. His vast experience of a fortnight

As he went through envelope after envelope the desks about him grad
ually were occupied by young men who entered from the hall with their
faces still red from the cold of the streets. For the most part they bore
the unmistakable stamp of the American college. They had that confident
poise which is easily brought from the athletic field. Moreover, their
clothes were quite in the way of being of the newest fashion. There was
an air of precision about their cravats and linen. But on the other hand
there might be with them some indifferent "Westerner who was obliged
to resort to irregular moans and harangue-startled shopkeepers in order
to provide himself with collars of a strange kind. He was usually very

The men. coming one and one or two and two. flung badinage to all cor
ners of the room. Afterward, as they wheeled from time to time In their
chairs, they bitterly insulted each other with the utmost good nature, tak
ing unerring aim at faults and riddling personalities with the quaint and
cynical humor of a newspaper office. Throughout this banter it was
strange to note hew Infrequently the men smiled, particularly when di

A wide door opened into another t_3*_ept -*vherÂ» .era menj* littl 1 -
slanted tables, each under an electric globe wth a green shade. Here a
curly headed scoundrel with a corncob pipe was hurling paper balls the
size of apples at the head of an Industrious nun. who, under these diffi
culties, was trying to draw a picture of an *.wful wreck with ghastly
faced sailors frozen in the rigging. Near this pair a lady was challenging
a German artist who resembled Napoleon 111 -*ith having been publicly
drunk at a music hall on the previous night. _*ext to the great gloomy
corridor of this sixteenth floor was a little office presided over by an austere
boy, and here waited in enforced patience a little dismal band of people
who wanted to see the Sunday editor.
Baker took a manuscript and after glancing about the room walked
over to a man at another desk. "Here is something that I think might do,"
he said The man at the desk read the first two pages. "But where is the
photograph?" he asked then. "There should be i photograph with this
thing." , , ,
"Oh, I forgot." said Baker. He brought from his desk a photograph
of the babe that had been born lacking arms and one eye. Baker's superior
braced a knee against his desk and settled back to a judicial attitude. He
took the photograph and looked at it impassively. 'Yes," he said alter a
time, "that's a pretty good thing. You better show 'â¢.hat to Coleman when
he comes in." "r' t--'\ "â ', /- - 'â â  _ - .
In the little office where the dismal band waited there had been a
sharp, hopeful stir when Rufus Coleman, the Sunday -dltor. passed rapidly
from door to door and vanished within the holy predicts. It had evidently
been in the minds of some to accost him then, but his eyes did not turn
once in their direction. It was as if he had not seen them. Many experi
ences had taught him that the proper manner of passing through this
office was at a blind gallop.
The dismal band turned then upon the austere ofl.ee boy. Some de
manded with terrible dignity that he should take in their cards at once.
Others sought to ingratiate themselves by smiles of tender friendliness.
He for his part employed what we would have called his knowledge of mi
and women upon. the group, and in consequence blundered and bungled
vividly, freezing with a. glance an annoyed and importunate Arctic ex
plorer who had come to talk of illustrations for an artie'e that had been
lavishly paid for in advance. The hero might have thought he was agam
In the northern seas. At the next moment the boy was treating almcst
courteously a German from the east side who wanted the Ecbpse to print
a grand full-page advertising description of his Invention, a gun which
was supposed to have a range of forty miles and to be able to penetrate
anything with equanimity and joy. The gun. as a matter of fact, had once
been induced to go off when it had hurled itself passionately upon its

In the perfect manner of an underdone lad dealing with matters too large

the imperturbable back of one of his staff, who had a desk against the op

once, '"No; met vet." Coleman was laying his hat on a chair. "Well, why
hasn't heY" lie "demanded. He glanced toward the door of the room in
which the curly beaded scoundrel with the corncob pipe was still hurling
paper talis at the man who was trying to invent the postures of dead
mariners frozen in the rigging. The office boy came timidly from ins post
ami informed Coleman of the waiting people. "All right," said the editor.
He dropped Into his chair and began to finger his letters, which had oeen
neatly opened and placed In a little stack by a boy. Baker came in with
the photograph of the miserable babe.
It was publicly believed that the Sunday staff of the Eclipse must have
'a kind of aesthetic delight in pictures of this kind, but Coleman's face
betrayed no emotion as he looked tit this specimen. He lit a fresh cigar,
tilted' bis chair and surveyed It with. a cold and stony stare. "Yes, that 3

Suddenly Coleman became executive. "Better give it to Schooner and tell
him to make a half-pageâ or, no, send him in here ancl I'll tell him my
idea. How's the article';' Any good? Well, give it to Smith to rewrite.
An artist came from the other room and presented for inspection his
drawing of th- seamen dead in the rigging of the wreck, a company of
grizzly and horrible figures, bony-fingered, shrunken and with awful eyes.
"Hum," said Coleman, after a prolonged study, "that's all right. That's
good, Jimmie. But you'd better work 'em up around the eyes a little
more." The office boy was deploying in the distance, waiting for the cor
rect moment to present some cards and names.
The artist was cheerfully taking away his corpses when Coleman jailed
him "Oh, Jim. let me see* that thing again, will you? Now, how about
this spar? This doesn't look right to me."
"It looks right to me," replied the artist, sulkily.
"But, see. it's going to lake up half a page. Can't you change it
somehow?" . , " ' ,
"How am I going to change it?" said the other, glowering at Coleman.
"That's the way it ought to he. How am I going to change it? That'- the
wav it ought to be." â¢" â ''-? : 'â -â 
"No. it Isn't at all," said Coleman. "You've got a spar sticking out of
the main hotly of the drawing in D way that will spoil the locks of the
whole page." . ; .. â¢
The artist was a man of remarkable popular reputation and he was
very stubborn and conceited of it. constant;:.- making himself unbearable
with covert threats thai If he was not delicately placated at all points he
would freight his genius over to the office of the- great opposition genius.
"That's the wav it ought to be," he repeated in a tone at once sullen
and superior. "The spar is all right. I can't rig -spars en ships just to
suit you."
"And I can't give up the whole paper to your accursed spars, either,"
said Coleman, with animation. "Don't you set you use about a third of a
page with this spar sticking off into space? Now, you were always so
clever. Jimmie, in adapting yourself to the page. can't you shorten it or
cut it off. or something? Or break that's the tiling. Make it a broken
spar dangling down. See?" .
"Yes, I s'pose I could do that," said the artist, mollified by a thought
of the ease with which he could make the change, and mollified, too, hy
the brazen tribute to a part of his cleverness.
"Well, do It, then," said the Sunday editor, turning abruptly away.
The artist, with head high, walked majestically back to the other room.
Whereat the curly headed one immediately resumed the rain of paper balls
upon him. The office boy came timidly to Coleman and suggested the pres
ence of the people In the outer office "Let them wait until I read my
mall." said Coleman. He shuffled the pack of letters indifferently through
his hands. Suddenly he came upon a little gray envelope. He opened it
at once and scanned its contents with the speed .if his craft. Afterward
he laid it down before him on the desk and surveyed it with a cool and
musing smile. "So?" he remarked. "That's the case. is it?"
Ho presently swung around In his chair, and for a time held the entire
attention of the men at the various desks. He outlined to them again their
various parts in the composition of the next great Sunday edition. In a.
few brisk sentences he set a complex machine in proper motion. His men
no longer thrilled with admiration at the precision with which he grasped
each obligation of the campaign toward a successful edition. They had
grown to accept it as they accepted his hat or his London clothes. At this
time his face was lit with something of the self-contained enthusiasm of a
general. Immediately afterward he arose and reached for his coat and hat.
The office boy, coming clrcuitously forward, presented him with some
cards and also with a scrap of paper upon which was scrawled a long and
semi-coherent word. "What are these?" grumbled Coleman.
"They are waiting outside." answered the boy with trepidation. It was
part of the law that the lion of the anteroom should cringe like a cold
monkey, more or less, as soon as he was out of his private jungle. "Oh,
Tallerman." cried the Sunday editor, "here's this Arctic man come to ar
range about his illustration. I wish you'd go and talk it over with him."
By chance he picked up the scrap of naper with Its cryptic word. "Oh,"
he said, scowling at the office boy. "Pity you can't remember that fellow.
If you can't remember faces any better" than that you should be a detec
tive. Get out now and tell him to go to the devil." The wilted slave turned
at once, but Coleman hailed him. "Hold on. Come to think of it, I will
see this idiot. Send him in." he commanded grimly.
Coleman lapsed Into a dream over the sheet of gray note paper. Pres
ently a middle-aged man. a palpable German, came hesitatingly into the
room and bunted among the desks as unmanageably as a tempest-tossed
scow. Finally he was impatiently tow.-d in the right direction He came
and stood at Coleman's elbow and waited nervously for the engrossed man
to raise his eyes. It was plain that this interview meant important things
to him. Somehow on his commonplace countenance was to to found the
expression of a dreamer, a fashioner of great and absurd projects, a fine.
tender fool. He cast hopeful and reverent glances at the nan who was
deeply contemplative of the gray note. He evidently believed himself on
the threshold of a triumph of some kind, and he awaited his fruition with
a joy that was only made sharper by the usual human suspicion of coming
events. ' . , '
Coleman glanced. up at Inst and saw bis visitor. "Oh. i:'s you, is It?"
he remarked icily, bending upon the Gorman the stare of i tyrant. "So
you've come again, have you?" He wheeled In his chair until he could
fully display a contemptuous, merciless smile. "Now, Mr. What's-your
name. you've called here to see me about twenty times alr'adv and at last
I am going to say something definite about your Invention." His listener's
face, which had worn for a moment a look of fright aid bewilderment,
gladdened swiftly to a gratitude that seemed the edge rf an outburst of
tears. "Yes." "continued Coleman, "I am gointr to say simethin-: deficit' 1
I am going to say that ft is the most imbecile bit of nonsense that, has
come within the range of my large newspaper experience. It is simply
the aberration of a rather remarkable lunatic. It is 10 good: It is not
worth the price of a cheese sandwich. I understand th-t its one feat has
been to break your leg; if it ever goes off again persuale it to break your
neck. And now I want you to take this nursery rhvrre of yours and get
out. And eHm't ever come here again. Do you understand? You under

The German was regarding him with the surprise and horror of a
youth shot mortally. He could not find his tongue 'or a moment. Ulti
mately he gasped. "But, Mr. Editorâ" Coleman irterrupted him tiger
ishlv. "You heard what I said. Get out." The mar bowed his head and
went slowly toward the door.
Coleman placed the little gray note in his breast pocket. He took his
hat and top coat, and evading the dismal band by i shameless maneuver
passed through the halls to the entrance to the elefator shaft. He heard
a movement behind him and saw that the German vas also waiting for the
elevator. .'
- Standing in the gloom of the corridor Coleman f.lt the mournful, owlish
eyes of the German resting upon him. Ho took a rise from his pocket and
elaborately lit a cigarette. Suddenly there was a lash of light and a e'ae* 1
of bronze, gilt and steel dropped magically from above. Coleman veiled'
"Down!" A door flew open. Coleman, followed by the German stepped
upon the elevator. "Well. Johnnie." he said cheerfully to the lad who
Operated tUiS i__ls^__ "'â¢_. business good?" ,'"X&. Bir: Dr.Stty good." an-Bwered the boy, grinning. The little cage sank swiftly: floor, after floor
seemed to be rising with marvelous speed; the whole building was winging
straight into tho sky. There were soaring I'ghts, figures and tha opal
escent glow of ground glass doors marked with black Inscriptions. Other
lift: were springing heavenward. All the lofty corridors rang with cries.
'..'Up!" "Down! "Down!" "Up!" The boy's hand grasped a lever and
bis machine obeyed his slightest movement, with sometimes an unbalanc
ing swiftness.
Coleman discoursed briskly to the ycuthful attendant. Once he turned
and regarded with a quick stare of insolent annoyance the despairing coun
tenance of the German, whose eves had never left him. When the elevator
arrived at the ground floor Coleman departed with the outraged air of a man
who for a time had been compelled to occupy a cell in company with a
harmless specter.
He walked quickly away. Opposite a corner of the City Hall he was
impelled to -ok behind him. Through the hordes of people with cable
cars marching like panoplied elephants he was able to distinguish the
German, motionless and gazing after him. Coleman laughed. 'That's a
comic old boy." he said to him--
Tn the grillroom of a Broadway hotel he was obliged to wait some min
utes for the fulfillment of his orders, and he spent the time in reading and
studying the little gray note. When his luncheon was served he ate with
an expression of morose dignity.
CHAPTER IV.
Marjory paused again at her father's door. After hesitating In the
original way she entered the library. Her father almost represented an
emblematic figure, seated upon a column of books. "Well," he cried.
Then seeing it was Marjory he changed his tone. "Ah. under the circum
stances, my dear, 1 admit your privilege of interrupting me at any hour
of the day. You have important business with mc." His manner was
eatanically Indulgent.
The girl lingered a book. She turned the leaves in absolute semblance
of a person reading. "Rufus Coleman called."
"Indeed?" said the professor.
"And I've come to you; father, before seeing him."
The professor was silent for a time. "Well". Marjory." he said at last,
"what do you want mo to say?" }lc spoke very deliberately. "I am sure
this is a singular situation. Hero appears the "man I formally forbid you
to marry. I am sure Ido net know-whatTl m to say."
"I wish to see h'.m." sad the girl. , , ,
__ "i ou wish to soo him?" inquired th". profe&sor. "You wish to see him.

are going to play no drama, are we, Marjory? I admit that I have white
whiskers and I am an obdurate father. 1 am, as you well may say. a very
urate father. You are not to marry Rufus Coleman. You understand
the rest of '.ho matter. Ho is here; you want to sec him. What will you
say to him when you see him?"
"I will say that yon refuse to let me marry him. father, andâ" She
hesitated a moment before she lifted her eyes fully and formidably to her
father's face. "_\-d that I shall marry him anyhow"
The professor did net cavort when this statement came from his daugh
ter. He nodded end then passed into a riod of reflection. Finally he
asked: "Rut when? That is tho point. When?"
Tho girl made a sad gesture. "T don't know. I don't know. Perhaps
when yon como to kr-ow Rufus betterâ"
"Know him better! Know that rans.-allion better? Why, I know him

Marjory made- no reply.
"Well said the prcfr*-=.-.r "yon may see Coleman on condition that you

at all how to manage these situations. I don't know what to do. I sup
pose I should go myself andâ Xo. you can't see him. Marjory."
Sti"! the girl made no reply. Her head sank forward and she breathed
a trifle heavily; . , , ,
"Marjory,? cried the professor, "it is impossible that you should think
pi much of this man." He arose and went to his daughter. "Marjory,
many wise ... have been guided by foolish fathers, but we both bus
pect "that no foolish child has over boen guided by a wise father. Let us
change it. I present myself ro you as a wise father. Follow my wishes
in this affair, and you "will be at least happier than if you marry this
wretched Coleman."
She answered: "He is waiting for me."
Tho professor turned abruptly from her and dropped Into his chair at
(he table. He resumed a grip on his pen. "Go." he said, wearily, "Go.
But if you have a remnant of sense, remember what I have said to you.
Go." He waved his hand in a dismissal that was slightly scornful. "I
hoped ycu would have a minor conception of what you were doing. It
eeoms a pity." Drooping in tears, th< girl slowly left the room.
Coleman" had an idea that he: had occupied the chair for several months.
He gazed about at the pictures and the odds and ends of a drawing room
in an attempt to take an interest In them. The great garlanded paper
shade over the piano lamp consoled his Impatience in a mild degree lie
can- be knew that Marjory had made it. He noted the clusters of cloth
violets which she had pinned upon the yellow paper and he dreamed over
the fact. He was able to endow this shade with certain qualities of senti
ment that caused his stare to become almost a part of an Intimacy, a com
munion. He looked as if he could have unburdened his soul to this shade
over the inc. lamp.
Upon the appearance of Marjory he sprang up and came forward rap
idly. "Dearest." he murmured, stretching out both hands. She gave him
one set of fingers with chilling convention. She said something which lie
understood to be 'â¢Good-afternoon." He started as if the woman before
him had suddenly drawn a knife. "Marjory," I*..- cried, "what Is the mat
ter?" Tlvy walked together toward a window. The girl looked at him in
polite inquiry. "Why?" she said. "Do l seem strange?" There was a
moment's silence while he gazed into her eyes, eyes full of innocence and
tranquility. At last she tapped her foot upon Ihe floor in expression of
mild impatience. "People do not like to be asked what is the matter when
there is nothins*- the matter What do you mean"
Cole-man's face had gradually hardened. "Well, what Is wrong?" he de
manded abruptly. "What has happened? What Is it. Marjory?"
She raised her glance in a perfect reality of wonder. "What Is wrong?
"What has happened? Haw absurd! Why; nothing, of course." She gazed
out of the window. "Look." she added brightly, "the students are roiling
somebody in a drift. Oh. the poor man."
Coleman, now wearing a bewildered air, made seme pretense of being
occupied with the scene. "Yes." he said ironically. "Very interesting, in
deed."
"Oh." said Marjory, suddenly, "I forgot to tell you. Father is -jolng
to take mother and me to Greece this winter with him and the class.
Coleman replied at once. "Ah. indeed? That will be jolly."
"Yes. Won't it bo charming?"
f"I don't doubt it," he replied. His composure may have displeased her,
for she glanced at him furtively and in a way that denoted surprise, per
haps.
"Oh. of course." she said in a glad voice, "it will be more fun. We ex
pect to have a fine time. There is such a nice lot of boys going. Some
times father chooses these dreadfully studious ones. But this time he acts
as If he knew precisely how to make up a party."
He reached for her hand and grasped it viselike. "Marjory," he
breathed passionately, "don't treat me so. Don't treat me â "
She wrenched her hand from him in regal indignation, "One or two
rings make it uncomfortable for the hand that is grasped by an angry
gentleman." She held her fingers and gazed as if "he expected to find
them mere debris. ''I am sorry that you are not Interested in the students
rolling that man in the snow. It is the greatest scene our quiet life can
. afford."
tHe was regarding her as a Judge faces a lying culprit. "I know." he
said after a pause. "Somebody has been telling you some stories. You
have been hearing something about me."
"Seme stories?" she inquired. "Some stories about you? What do you
mean? Do you mean that I remember stories I may happen to hear about
people?"
There was another pause and then Coleman's face flared red. He beat
his hand violently upon a table. "Good God. Marjory, don't make a fool
of me. Don't make this kind of a fool of me, at any rate. Tell me what
you mean. Explain â "
She laughed at him. "Explain? Really, your vocabulary Is getting
extensive, but it -is dreadfully awkward to ask people to explain when
there is nothing* to explain."
He glanced at her. "I know as well as you do that your father is tak-
Ing you to Greece in order to get rid of me."
"And do people have to go to Greece in order to get rid of you?"
asked civilly. "I think you are getting excited."
"Marjory." he began stormily.
She raised her hand. "Hush." she said; "there is somebody coming."
A bell had rung. A maid entered tho room. "Mr. Coke," she said. Mar-
Jory nodded. In the interval of waiting Coleman gave the girl a glance
that mingled despair with rage and nride. Then ' " 'â¢*â¢ hurst with half
tamed rapture into the room. "Oh. Miss '- wright." be almost shouted.
"I can't tell you how glad 1 am. I just heard to-day you were going. Im
agine it It wil! be more â oh. how are you. Coleman; how are you?"
Marjory welcomed the newcomer with a I'alitv that might not have
thrilled Coleman with pleasure. They took chairs that formed a triangle
and one side of it rated wit talk. Coke .nd Marjory engaged In a
tumultuous conversation concerning the prospective trip to Greece. Tho
Sunday editor, as remote as if the apex of his angle was the top of a hill,
could only study the girl's clear profile. The youthful voices of the two
others rancr like bells. He did not scowl at Coke: he merely looked at him
ns if ho srently disdained bis mental caliber. In fact, all the talk seemed
to tire him; it was chi!di=h; as for him, he apparently found the babble
almost insupporfablo.
"Anil hist 'hunk of the camel rides -we'll have." cried Coke.
"Camel rides." reneated Coleman dejectedly. "My dear Coke."
Finally he arose like an old man climbing from' a sickbed. "Well.
"Marjory," he breathed passionately, "dor/t treat
me so."
am afraid I must go. Miss Wainwright." Then he said affectionately to
Coke: "Good-bv. old boy. I hope you have a good time. ___,-,
Marjory walked with him to the door. He shook her hand in a friendly
fashion "Good-by. Marjory." he said. "Perhaps It may happen that I
shan't ace you again before you start for Greece and so I had best bid you
godspeedâ or whatever th" term isâ now. You will have a charming time;
Greece must be a delightful place. Really. I envy you. Marjory. And now
mv dear childâ" His voice grew brotherly, filled with patronage of gen
crbus fraternal love. "Although I may never see you again, let me w* sh
you fifty as happy years as this last one has been for me. He smiled
frankly into her -eves*, then dropping her hand he went away.
Coke renewed his tempest of talk as Marjory turned toward him. But
after a series of splendid eruptions, whose red fire illumined all of ancient
and modern Greece, he. too, went away.
The professor was In his library apparently absorbed In a book when a
tottering, â¢.--ale-faced woman appeared to him and in her course toward a
couch ln a corner of the room described almost a semicircle. She flung
herself face downward. A thick strand of hair swept over her shoulder.
"Oh, my heart la broken! My heart Is broken!"
. The professor arose, grizzled and thrice old with pain. He went to the
couch, but he found himself a handless, feetless man. "My poor child, he
said. "My poor child." He remained listening stupidly to her convulsive
sobbing. A ghastly kind of solemnity came upon the room.
Suddenly the girl lifted herself and swept the strand of hair away from
her face. She looked at the professor with the wide open, dilated eyes or
one who still sleeps. "Father," she said in a hollow voice, "he don't love
me. He don't love me. He don't love me at all. You were right, father.
She began to laugh. ,â, ,Â£ , _ â
"Marjory," said the professor, trembling, "be quiet, child. Be quiet._ .

CH.-.PTER V.
By a strange mishap of management the train which bore Coleman
back toward New York was fetched Intc an obscure sidetrack of some
lonely region and there compelled to bide a change of fate. The engine
wheezed and sneezed like a paused fat man. The lamps in the cars per
vaded a stuffy ode of smoke and oil. Coleman examined his case and
found only one cigar. Important brakemen proceeded rapidly along the
aisles, and when they swung open the doors a polar wind circled the legs
"This doesn't look righ)t to me. It's goirjg to taÃe up half a page. Cao't you change it somehow?"
of the passengers. "Well, now, what is all this for?" demanded Coleman,
furiously. "1 want to get buck to New York."
The conductor replied with sarcasm: "Maybe you think I'm stuck on
it? I ain't running the road I'm running this train, and I run it accord
ing to orders." Amid the dismal comforts of the waiting cars Coleman
felt all the profound misery of the rebuffed true lover. He had been sen
tenced, he thought, to a penal servitude of the heart, as he watched the
dusky, vague ribbons of smoke come from the lamps and felt to his knees
the cold winds from the brakeman's busy flights. When the train started
with a whistle and a jolt he was elate as if in his abjection his beloved's
hand had reached to him from the clouds.
When he had arrived in New York a cab rattled him to an uptown hotel
with speed in the restaurant he first ordered a large bottle of cham
pagne. The last of the wine he finished in somber mood like an unbroken
and defiant man who chews the straw that litters his prison house. Dur
ing his- dinner he was continually sending out messenger boys. He was
arranging a poker party. Through a window he watched the beautiful
moving life of Upper Broadway at night, with its crowds and clanging
cable cars and its electric signs, mammoth and glittering like the jewel-?
of a giantess.
Word was brought to him that the poker players were arriving. He
arose joyfully, leaving his cheese. In the broad hall, occupied mainly by
miscellaneous people and actors, all deep In leather chairs, he found some
of his friends waiting. They trooped upstairs to Coleman's rooms, where
as a preliminary Coleman began to hurl books and papers from the table
to the floor. A boy came with drinks. Most of the men, in order to pre
pare for the game, removed their coats and cuffs and drew up the sleeves
of their shirts. The electric globes shed a blinding light upon the table.
The sound of clinking chips arose; the elected banker spun the cards care
less and dexterous.
Later, during a pause of dialing. Coleman said: "Biille, what kind of
a lad is that young Coke up at. Washurst?" He addressed an old college
friend. *
"Oh, you mean the Sophomore Coke*-" asked the friend. "Seems a
decent sort of fellow. I don't know. Why?"
"Well, who Is he? Where does he come from? What do you know
about him?"
"lbs one of those Ohio Cokes-c-regular thingâ millionaireâ used
to be a barberâ good old boyâ why?"
"Nothln'," said Coleman, looking at his cards. "I know the lad. I
thought he was a good deal of an ass. I wondered who his people were."
"Oh, his people are all rightâ in one way. Father owns rolling mill--.
Do you raise It, Henry? Well, In* order to make vice abhorrent to the
young I'm obliged to raise back."
"I'll see it." observed Coleman, slowly pushing forward two blue chips.
Afterward he reached behind him and took another glass of wine.
To the others Coleman seee_ned to. have something' bitter upon hi*>
mind. He played poker quietly, steadfastly, and wlthgyt change of eve
following the mathematical religion of the game. Outside of the play he
was savage, almost Insupportable. r â 
"What's the matter with you. Rufus? said his old college friend. "Lost
your job? Girl gone back on you? You're a hell of a 'host. We don't get
anything but insults and drinks." .â¢â ,.,,â¢',
Late at night Coleman began to lose steadily. In the meantime he
drank glass after glass of wine. Finally he made reckless bets on a medi
ocre hand and an opponent followed him thoughtfully bet by bet. Un
daunted, calm, absolutely without emotion, Coleman lost. He hurled down
his cards, "Nobody but a damned fool would, have, seen that last raise on
anything less than a full hand." -
"Steady. Come off. that's wrong with you. Rufus?" cried his guests.
"You're not drunk, are you?" said his old college friend, puritanically.
" 'Drunk'?" repeated Coleman.
"Oh. say." cried a man. "let's play cards. What's all this gabbling?"
It was when a gray, dirty light of dawn evaded the thick curtains and
fought on the floor with the feebb-d electric glow that Coleman, in the
midst of play, lurched his chest heavily upon the table. Some chips rat
tled to the floor. "I'll call you." ho murmured sleepily.
"Well." replied a man sternly, "three kings."
The other players with difficulty extracted five cards from beneath
Coleman's pillowed bead. "Not a pair! Come, come: this won't do. . Oh,
let's stop playing. This is the rottenest game I ever sat in. Let's go home.
Why don't you put him to bed, Bible-"'
When Coleman awoke next morning he looked back upon the pok-*r
game as something that had transpired in previous years. He dressed md
went down to the grillroom. For his breakfast he ordered .some eggs on
toast and a pint of champagne. A privilege of liberty belonged to a cer
tain Irish waiter, and this waiter looked at him. grinning. "Maybe you
had a pretty lively time last night. Mr. Coleman?"
"Tea. Pat." answered Coleman, "I did. It was all because of an unre
quited affection. Patrick." The man stood near, a napkin over his arm.
Coleman went on Impressively. * "The ways of the modern lover are
strange. Now. T. Patrick, am a modern lover, and when yesterday the

modern point of view. I understand on good authority that in old times
lovers used to languish. That is probably a He. but at any rate we do not
in these times languish to any great extent. We get drunk. Do you un
derstand. Patrick?
The waiter was used to a harangue at Coleman's breakfast time. He
placed his hand over his mouth and giggled. "Y'essir." ',__.,
"Of course." continued Coleman, thoughtfully, "it might be pointed out
by uneducated persons that it is difficult to maintain a high standard or
drunkenness for the adequate length of time, but in the series of experi
ments which I am about to make I am sure I can easily prove them to be
in the wrong."
"I. am sure, sir." said the waiter, "the young ladles would not like to
be hearing you talk- this way." Â_,-,
"Yes: no doubt, no doubt. The young ladies have still quite medieval
ideas. They don't understand. They still prefer lovers to languish.
"At any rate, sir. I don't see that your heart is sure enough broken.
You seem to take it very easy." . , ,
"Broken!" cried Coleman. " 'Easy.* Man, my heart ls In fragments.
Bring me another small bottle."
CHAPTER VI.
Six weeks later Coleman went to the office of the proprietor of the
Eclipse. Coleman was ons of those smooth-shaven old-young men who
wear upon some occasions a singular air of temperance and purity. At
these times his features lost their quality of worldly shrewdness and end
less suspicion and bloomed as the face of some innocent boy. It then would
be hard to tell that he had ever encountered even such a crime as a lie
or a cigarette. As he walked into the proprietor's office he was a perfect
semblance of a fine, inexperienced youth. People usually concluded- this
change was due to a Turkish bath or some other expedient of recuperation,
but it was due probably to the power of a physical characteristic.
'"Boss in?" said Coleman.
"Teh," said the secretary, jerking his thumb toward an inner door. In
his private office Sturgeon sat on the edge of the table dangling one leg
and dreamily surveying the wall. As Coleman entered he looked up
quickly. "Rufus," he cried, "you're just the man I wanted to see. I've
Â§ot a scheme. A great scheme." He slid from the table and began to pace
risklv to and fro, his hands deep in his trousers pockets, his chin sunk in
his collar, his light blue eyes afire with interest. "Now listen. This is im
mense. The Eclipse enlists a battalion of men to go to Cuba and fight the
Spaniards under its own flagâ the Eclipse flag. Collect trained officers
from here and thereâ every young devil we seeâ drill 'emâ best rifles
âloads of ammunitionâ provisionsâ staff of doctors and nurses-a couple
of dynamite everything completeâ best in the world. Now. isn t
that great? What's the matter with that now? Eh? Eh? Isn t thai
great? It's great, isn't it? Eh? Why. my boy. we'll freeâ" |
Coleman did not seem to ignite. "I have been arrested four or five times
already on fool matters connected with the newspaper business," he ob
served gloomily, "but I've never yet been hung. I think your scheme is
a beauty." â¢ '-'.. - â  '*_'--'â¢;
sturgeon paused In astonishment. "Why. what happens to be the mat
ter with you? What are you kicking about?"
Coleman made a slow gesture. "I'm tired," he answered. "I need a
vacation."
"Vacation'" cried Sturgeon. "Why don't you take one then?"
"That's what I've come to see you about. I've had a prefer heavy
strain on me for three years now. and 1 want to get a little rest.'
"Well, who in thunder has been keeping you from it? It hasn't
been me." â¢ --, -.'--:..: m*
"I know it hasn't been you, but of course I wanted the paper to go
and I wanted to have mv share in its success, but now that everything is
all riehl I think I might go away for a time if you don't mind."
"Mind!" exclaimed Sturgeon, falling into his chair and reaching for his
check book. "Where do you want to go? How long do you want to be
gone? How much money do you want?"
"I don't want very much. And as for where I want to go, I thought I
might like to go to Greece for a while." .
Sturgeon had been writing a check. He poised his pen in the air and
began to laugh. "That's a queer place to go for a rest. Why. the biggest
war of modern timesâ a' war that may involve all Europeâ ls likely to Jtart
there at any moment. You are not likely to get any rest in Greece."
"I know that." answered Coleman. "I know there is likely to be a war
there. But I think that is exactly what would rest me. I would like to
report the war."
"You are a queer bird." answered Sturgeon, deeply fascinated with
this new idea. He had apparently forgotten his vision of a Cuban volun
teer battalion. "War correspondence is about the most original medium
for a rest I ever hoard of."
"Oh. it may seem funny, but really any change will be good for me
now. I've been whacking at this old Sunday edition until I'm sick of
it, and sometimes I wish the Ecllnse was in hell."
"That's all right." lauched the proprietor of the Eclipse. "But I still
don't see how you arc going to get any vacation out of a war that will
upset the .whole of Europe. But that's your affair. If you want to become
the chief correspondent In the field in case of any such war. why. of course.
I would be glad to have you. I couldn't get anybody better. But I don't
see where your vacation comes In."
a "I'll take care of that." answered Coleman. "When I take a vacation
I want to take It my own way. and I think this will be a vacation because
it will be different you see? â different."
"No, I don't see any sense in it. but if you think that is the way that
suits you, why. go ahead. How much money do you want?"
. â¢ "I don't want much. Just enough to see me through nicely."
Sturgeon scribbled on his check book and then ripped a check from it.
"Here's a thousand dollars. Will that do you to start with?"
"That's plenty."
"When do you want to start?"
"To-morrow."
"Oho," said Sturgeon. "You're in a hurry." This impetuous manner
of exit from business seemed to appeal to him. "To-morrow." he repeated.
smiling. In reality ho was some kind of a poet using his millions roman
tically, spending wildly on a sentiment that might be with beauty or
without beauty, according to the momentary vacillation. The vaguely
defined desperation in Coleman's last announcement appeared to delight
him. He grinned and placed the points of his fingers together, stretching
out his legs in a careful attitude of indifference which might even mean
disapproval. "To-morrow." he murmured teasingly.
"By- iiminy." exclaimed Coleman, ignoring the other man's mood. "I'm
sick of the whole business. "I've got out a Sunday paper once a week for
three years and I feel absolutely incapable of getting out another edition.
It would be all right if we were running on ordinary lines, but when each

"Why, I'm not objecting to your having a vacation. I'm simply mar

"Well, it suits me," muttered Coleman, sulkily.
"Well, if it suits you, that's enough. Here's your check. Clear out
now and don't let me see you agam until you are thoroughly rested, even
If it takes a year." He arose and stood smiling. He was mightily pleased
with himself. He liked to perform in this way. He was almost seraphic
as he thrust the check for a thousand dollars toward Coleman.
Then his manner changed abruptly. "Hold on a minute. I must think
a little about this thing if you are going to manage the correspondence.
Of course it will be a long and bloody war."
"You bet."
"The be chance s that all Europe will be dragged nto t. Of course
then you would have to come out of Greece and take up a better positionâ

"No, I wouldn't care to do that." said Coleman positively. I just want
to take care of the Greek end of it."
"It will be an idiotic way to take a vacation," observed Sturgeon.
"Well, it suits me," muttered Coleman again. "I tell you what It Is,
he added suddenly. "I've got some private reasonsâ see?"
Sturgeon was radiant with joy. "Private reasons." He was charmed
by the somber pain in Coleman's eves and his own ability to eject it.
"Good. Go now and be blowod. I will cable final instructions, to meet you
in London. As soon as you get to Greece cable me an account of the situ
ation there and we will arrange our plans." He began to laugh. "Private
reasons. Come out to dinner with me."
"I can't very well," said Coleman. "If I go to-morrow I've got to
But here the rehl tyrant appeared, emerging suddenly from behind tho
curtain of sentiment, appearing like a red devil in a pantomime. "You
can't?" snapped Sturgeon. "Nonsenseâ"
CHAPTER VII.
Sweeping out from between two remote, half-submerged dunes on which
stood slender sentry lighthouses, the steamer began to roll with a gentle
insinuating motion. Passengers in their staterooms saw at rhythmica-.
intervals the spray racing fleetly past the portholes. The waves grappled
hurriedly at the sides of the great flying steamer and boiled discomfited
astern in a turmoil of green and white. From the tops of the enormous
funnels streamed level masses of smoke which were immediately torn to
nothing by the headlong wind. Meanwhile as the steamer rushed into the
northeast men in caps and ulsters comfortably paraded the decks and
stewards arranged deck chairs for the reception of various women who
were coming from their cabins with rugs. - '-'.; â " ;"
In the smoking room old voyagers were settling down comfortably,
while new voyagers were regarding them with a diffident respect. Amon*r
the passengers Coleman found a number of people whom he knew, in
cluding a wholesale wine merchant, a Chicago railway magnate and a. New
York millionaire. They lived practically in the smoking room. Necessity
drove them from time to time to the salon or to their berths. Once indeed,
the millionaire was absent from the group while penning a short note to
his wife. -"â â¢- -.r. - , , , ...
When the Irish coast was sighted Coleman came on deck to look at it.
A tall young woman Immediately halted in her walk until he had stepped
up to her. "We!!, of all ungallant men, Rufus Coleman, you are the star,
she cried, laughing, and held out her hand.
"Awful sorry. I'm sure," he murmured. "Been playing poker in tha
smoking room all voyage. Didn't have a look at the passenger list until
just now. Why didn't you send mc word?" These lies were told so mod
estly and sincerely that when the girl flashed her brilliant eyes full upon
their author there was a mixture of admiration in the Indignation.
"Send you a card? I don't believe you can read, Rufus. Else you would
have known I was to sail on this steamer. If I hadn't been ill until to-day
you would have seen me in the salon. I open at the Folly Theater next
week. Dear ol' Lunnon. y' know."
"Of course I knew you were going," said Coleman, "but I thought you
were to go later. What do you open in?"
. " 'Fly by Night.' Come walk along with me. See those two old ladles?
They've been watching for me like hawks ever since we left New York.
They expect me to flirt with every man on board But I've fooled them.
I've been just as g-o-o-d. I had to be."
As the pair moved toward the stern enormous and radiant green waves
were crashing futilely after the steamer. Ireland showed a dreary coast
line to the north. A wretched man who had crossed the Atlantic eighty
four times was declaiming to a group of novices. A venerable banker,
bundled in rugs, was asleep in his deck chair.
"Well. Nora," said Coleman. "I hope you make a hit in London. You
deserve it if anybody does. You've worked hard." .--.':â¢/
"Worked hard." cried the girl. "I should think so. Eight years ago
I was in the rear row. Now I have the center of the stage whenever I
want It. I made Chalmers cut out that great scene in the second act be
tween the Queen and Rodolfo. The Idea! Did he think I would stand
that? And just because he was in love with Clara Trotwood, too."
Coleman was dreamy. "Remember when I was dramatic man for tha
Gazette and wrote the first notice?"
"Indeed, I do." answered the girl affectionately. "Indeed. I do, Rufus.
Ah. that was a great lift. I believe that was the first thing that had an
effect on old Oliver. Before that he never would believe that I was any
-good. -Give me your arm. Rufus. Let's parade before the two old women.
Coleman glanced at her keenly. Her voice had trembled slightly. Her
eyes were lustrous as if she were about to weep.
"Good heavens," he said, "you are the same old Nora Black. I thought
you would be proud and 'aughty by this time." â 'â  .'â >
"Not to my friends." she murmured. "Not to my friends. I'm always
the same and I never for.get, Rufus." v ".-;
"Never forget what?" asked Coleman.
"If anybody does me a favor I never forget it as long as I live," she
answered fervently.
"Oh. you mustn't be so sentimental, Nora. You remember that play
you bought from little Ben Whipple just because he had once sent you
some flowers in the old days when you were poor and happened to bo
sick? A sense of gratitude cost you over eight thousand dollars that time,
didn't It?" Coleman laughed heartily.
"Oh. it wasn't the flowers at all." she interrupted seriously. "Of course
Ben was always a nice boy. but then his play was worth a thousand dol
lars. That's all I gave him. I lost some more In trying to make It go.
But it was too good. That was what was the matter. It was altogether
too good for the public. I felt awfully sorry for poor little Ben."
"Too good - *" sneered Coleman. "Too good? Too indifferently bad, yon
mean. My dear girl, you mustn't imagine that you know a good play. YOu
don't at all."
She paused abruptly and faced him. This regal creature was looking
at him so sternly that Coleman felt awed for a moment as If he were In
the presence of a great mind. "Do you mean to say that I'm not an ar
tist?" __>___. asked.

The Girl Who Carries
A Latch Key.
AN EARLY-TO-BED
CLUB.
<-->F beauty-seeking femininity would or
' ganize an "early-to-bed" club.oneof the
ii foremost rules and regulations requir
ing that each member should crawl
into bed at sunset or a very little later.
there would be enough pretty women
about tec considerably embarrass the
s-hade of Mons. Paris should it wander
back from spirit land.
The fact of the matter Is, women do
not half realize the benefits of lots of
restful, refreshing sleep. All women
struggle and fret and pray for physical
loveliness and yet so few of them seem
to understand that there is more real sub
stantial beauty to be obtained from sen
sible hygienic living than can he squeezed
out of all the cosmetic jars that ever
t>mpted weak feminine hearts.
Beauty sleep. We've heard It prated
of ever since the days of short frocks
and sugar plums, when our blessed moth
ers whispered It In our ears. Even then
the prospect of beauty possessed a charm
that brightened the "sand man's" hour
ond sent us along contentedly to our little
beds.
And surely we need it more now than
we did then, for perhaps those distressing
little lines that old gentleman Time traces
with such relentless fingers on the faces
of high and low alike are beginning to be
apparent and the smooth skin of early
girlhood is losing Its brightness and as
suming a yellowish tinge, like that a leaf
takes on when first touched with the au
tumn chill.
Sleep is the great natural restorative,
wit!. which great physical beauty is
out of the question. Tired nerves and
broken-down tissues are certainly not
conducive to a high form of beauty and
in order to keep the exhausted forces of
the body in proper repair sleep Is abso
lutely necessary.
Some people require more sleep than
others, but every one should have at least
eight hours, and ten, to my mind, is not
too much.
But there are wrong ways of sleeping
and right ways. The girl who lies curled
up like a shrimp Is the one who will dis
cover an early inclination to round shoul
ders, and she will find that she simply
cannot make those shoulders square and
nice as long as she sleeps in this fashion.
The woman who Bleeps upon a pillow that
raises her head half a foot higher than
her heels will be distracted to rind that
the wrinkles are appearing .-cc rapidly that
all the skin food in the world will be
powerless to erase them.
The pillow is one of the most fruitful
sources of those fine lines about the eyes
known as "crowsfeet" and "turkey
tracks," and tin- softer the pillow the
more lines will it encourage, for the flesh
of tlie face will be puckered up Into In
numerable litttle folds. If you do not be
lieve this, look in the mirror the first
thing upon awakening and you will find
the little lines more apparent than at any
other time in the twenty-four hours.
There it no necessity for pillows at all.
Look at the Japanese women, who sleep
upon a block of wood hollowed out for
their necks to lit Into, and you can all
ccc what fine, smooth, wrinkleless skins
they have.
So, lirst of all, dispense with the pillow.
If you feel that you cannot do this all
at once, then gradually have your pillow
made smaller and smaller until none at
all is desired. You will sleep so much
better that after the habit is once formed
you will wonder how you ever managed
to sleep upon the squashy things. ThÂ«
bed should i..- hard and perfectly flat,
with good, firm springs. A hair mattress
Is really the best for health and com
fort.
One should always awaken refreshed.
If you pitch and toss during sleep and
arise in the morning with a dull head
ache or a feeling of weariness, you may
make up your mind that something is
wrong. It may be you are troubled or
worried, or perhaps you have been work
ing too hard. Your digestion may be out
of order, or possibly the room ls not suf
ficiently ventilated. Any of these things
will prevent one from getting the rest
that is absolutely necessary for health
and good looks.
The covering should not be too heavy.
Too much covering Is distressing and as
good a source for nightmares as crab
salad or mince pie. The window should
be open top and bottom, so as to Insure
perfect ventilation. Don't eat hearty, in
digestible lunches just before retiring;
this is one of the biggest of beauty mis
takes.
The proper position for sleep is to lie
face downward, with the hands at the
sides. I do not mean by this that you
are to chew on the sheet half the night
or try to smother yourself the other half.
Turn the face to one side. You will find
the position very comfortable and it will
keep the shoulders back and give you a
good figure and an excellent carriage.
If after following these directions you
still spend the night jumping and jerking
and flinging your arms about like wind
mills you may safely conclude that you
need a good tonic or a physician's advice,
for either your nerves or your digestion
must need attention.
To recapitulate: If you wish to be beau
tiful you must sleep well, and you must
sleep a whole lot. Late hours will bring
white hair, dark circles under the eyes,
wrinkles and numerous other beauty
woes. Sleep keeps the body strong and
fresh, smooths out the skin and puts nat
ural roses Into the cheeks. So if you want
a complexion that will rival In tints the
lily and the rose sleep just as many hours
as" you possibly can every night of your
life."
Arjswers to Correspondents.
MURIELâ As your hair Is so very oily
use the following tonic: One-half pint
alcohol, one-half pint water and thirty
grains of quinine. Apply every other
night, rubbing it into the scalp. The hair
should not be brushed very vigorously
while it Is coming out in such quantities.
I do not happen to have a formula for
rose sachet, and. really, the druggists
keep such a good assortment of -sachets
that are not at all expensive that it Is
scarcely worth while trying to make them
oneself. A very good powder that has
the rose odor Is made by sifting over and
over again one ounce of the finest rice
powder with three ounces of pure oxide
of zinc and adding three drops of oil of
rose. If you wish a flesh tint, add one
grain of carmine.
PINEAPPLEâ The condition of your
skin is no doubt due to imperfect circu
lation, or it may come from an anaemic
condition of the blood. If from the for
mer cause, the circulation must be equal
ized and strengthened by exercise and
proper clothing. Tonics and good nour
ishing food are the remedies if the cause
is impoverished blood. A very excellent
lotion for inflamed eyes Is made by
rubbing one teaspoonful of pulverized
boracic acid in fifteen drops of spirits of
camphor, and pouring over this two
thirds of a cup of hot water. Stir and
strain and use as needed.
VISALIA D.â lf your hair is very oily
use the tonic suggested in foregoing let
ter to Muriel. If, however, the hair Is
Inclined to be dry, the following tonic
will prove of greater benefit: Four ounces
tan de cologne, one-half ounce tincture
cantharldes, one-fourth dram each of oil
of lavender and oil of rosemary. Apply
to the roots of the hair with a small
sponge once or twice a day.
JOE Bâ Try the following softsoap for
the blackheads. It will oftentimes clear
the skin entirely: Take a "-cent cake of
pure castile soap and melt it in three cup
fuls of boiling water. When cooled so
that it is merely blood warm add two
saltspoonfuls of borax and one table
spoonful each of pure liquid ammonia and
glycerin. Keep in a glass jar. Scrub the
entire body with this and rinse well. Ap
ply to the face with a complexion brush,
and after a thorough rinsing in tepid
water apply a good cold cream. This
lotion is good, too: One half pint rose
water, one half pint orange flower water,
add, drop by drop, one half ounce simple
tincture of benzoin, six minims tincture
myrrh and a few drops of glycerin.
rely sponge the surface lightly with
the lotion.
JACKâ As you have used the tonic con
taining cantharldes for so long a time It
would be well, I think, to cease its use for
a while. You can use the bay rum by It
self to cleanse and freshen up the hair.
BLANCHEâ peroxide should be ap
plied to the superfluous hair with a
sponge. It will not kill the hair growth.
It will merely cause the hair to become so
light in color that It will be scarcely
noticeable. You can apply it every other
night the first week and then not quite so
often. Let It dry on. No, lt will not
coarsen the hair.
MISS ANXIOUS TO KNOWâ My advice
to you ls to let the growth of hair re
ligiously alone, unless It is dark in color.
In which case bleach it with peroxide of
hydrogen, as suggested to Blanche. There
la no way to remove It except by using
a depilatory. This will only remove lt
for a time, and it will return heavier and
stiffer than before. Why do you worry
about It, as long as it Is out of sight? 1
should Just never give it a thought.
MAUD E. J.â The raised molesâ that is,
those that are raised above the surface
of the skin â can be removed by using
acetic acid. Dip the end of a wooden
toothpick in the acid and with It touch
lightly the center of the mole. Do this
three nights In succession. A crust will
then form, which in the course of a cou
ple of weeks will drop off, taking the
mole with it. Care must be taken not
to get any of the acid on the surrounding
white skin, else a scar will result. It is
much better to let an experienced hand
do work of this sort. If you will send
me a stamped addressed envelope I will
give you a name and address of some
one who will do this for you neatly and
inexpensively.

bile girl will not be a success.
It is only a little more than a year since
the Countess de Castellane, an American
girl abroad, appeared upon the boulevard
In her motor carriage and, with the lever
In hand and tiny foot upon the brake,
guided the carriage down the street,
through the Bois and home again with
out accident, stopping en route to pick
up the Count, her husband, who settled
back in the cushions and watched his
wife contentedly. The Countess wore a
gown of deep scarlet, with a scarlet hat
trimmed with black, thus supplying that
touch of ebony which makes a Paris cos
tume so chic.
Next we heard of the automobile red,
that dark, rich red which seemed at
tached to the automobile in some subtle
way. Then came the automobile hat, a
turn-back affair, and soon there were au
tomobile gloves of white, with black
stitching. From all this beauty came
forth the automobile girl.-
But she did not long remain a French
woman. She appeared in this country,
twice as chic, thrice as capable and four
times the sportswoman. You- -- â -â¢ her

the papers. She sewed all flay, complained
most of the time, and in the evening was
obliged to paint and powder well before
she could go to the theater because of the
ravages made by needlework and worry.
A new woman of the right sort is very
attractive because of her ideas. Mr. Bryan
said the other day that an idea was a
wonderful thing. I heard him remark at
the dollar dinner that an Idea would rev
olutionize the world; and that an Idea
turned loose could never be chained up
again. The new woman has so many of
these Ideas that she Is posl
tively fascinating, and in all my
experience, which is necessarily
from my profession a very broad
one, I have never seen a new woman who
failed to keep her husband fascinated if
she were married. If she were a bach
elor girl she had more suitors than she
could refuse comfortably each year.
I know the term new woman is unpopu
lar with the men, but the new woman her
self is very popular with them. She ls
the "nice little -girl" whom all men like.
Would you believe that Mrs. Potter
mornings near Central Park, guiding her
vehicle ail alone and dodging the nurse
maids and escaping the baby carriages in
a marvelous way. Afternoons you met
her, not alone this time, but with her load
of summer men, on. her way out to
Grant's tomb, to come back in the even
ing laden with dew and honors. Ah! the
automobile girl began to be very winsome
âmore so than the coaching girl or the
equestrienne.
And what had she to learn, this auto
mobile girl? She mastered the trick of
the levers in a short time, and learned
how to put on the brakes and how to
"back" and come forward at short notice.
But there was more. She had to learn to
take a vehicle with the manners of a
kangaroo and make a polite carriage out
of itâ a lady's carriage.
When on the level the automobile girl
had It easy. With a touch upon the lever,
which she was always Inclined to call her
handle bars, l she made the connection and
sped awayi Here she made her best
speed, but as soon as the country grew
rough then came the test of sportswom

Going up hill the automobile must be
coaxed like a team. It must be driven
slowly, with only half speed on, and the
smoothest places in the road must be se
lected. If too much pressure is put upon
it there will be a quick, vicious snap and
the automobile will be disabled and must
be abandoned for repairs. A good driver
will run a vehicle for seasons without a
break, as a good bicyclist will ride sum
mer after summer without repairs. A
poor rider breaks his wheel In a day; an
Incapable automobllist must call upon the
horse at an early date.
In going down hill the automobile girl
must show wisdom. It is only recently
that W. K. Vanderbilt Jr., at Newport,
overturned his vehicle going down hill.
While this Is not easy to doâ the young
millionaire was riding backward, just for
THE AUTOMOBILE GIRL.
don't BE MANNISH DONT SMOKE
Palmer Is one of the new women, and that
pretty little Virginia Fair was one also?
It Is true; they have both told me so.
Mrs. Palmer said that if she had been in
the Windsor fire she could have gone
down a rope hand over hand, and Miss
Fair proved that she knew how to act in
a fire by rescuing her jewels and her
clothes and the best of the bric-a-brac be
fore stepping out of the villa which
burned at midnight while she was on her
sportâ there Is nevertheless a chance for
an accident. Both brakes must be mas
tered, and the automobile must be nicely
checked all the way.
A great discussion is now going on in
France over the relative qualities of
sportsmanship between a coach and an
automobile. Which requires the most
skill and consequently the best outdoor
work? There are adherents of both kinds
of sport, but the majority are automobil-
Ists. Even so simple a thing as the filling
of the reservoir in a petrolenm machine
takes experience. The rider must learn
to gauge the amount in the can or he will
be grievously Imposed upon when he stops
for a refilling.
The automobile girl must understand
her vehicle. If it breaks she mu3t know
what is broken and how serious Is the
damage done. If she Is ignorant upon this
subject she will be charged well by the
repairer, who will put In a bill for time,
naming many small matters that needed
doing. If she can boldy state the trouble
and ask for a certain repair, then she has
the whole matter in her own hands. It
all seems dense at first to the auto
moblllst, but she soon learns.
The automobile girl can be a city girl,
for the carriages are driven on the thor
oughfares. Fifth avenue sees them every
evening, even on ihe hottest nights. There
are more than twenty of the vehicles in
New York owned by well-known women.
And there are dozens of them to hire.
Not the least appreciative of the auto
mobile girl is the man who sits looking
on. He ls being driven, and it rests him,
and he does not feel every minute that he
ought to take the ribbons.
The automobile girl need not be the
child of wealth, for she can hire cheaply.
And they tell us that In another year the
new horseless carriage will be within the
reach of all who stand a chance of owning
any pleasure vehicle, and then we shall,
indeed, have the automobile girl among
us.
wedding tour. The old-fashioned woman
would have taken to screams and sal vola
tile, but the new woman got along without
either.
Partly because she finds the pursuit fas
cinating and partly because she is criti
cized past endurance, the new woman
sometimes takes a step too far and be
comes too new. In the summer she will
slip away to the races and put down a lit
tle bet of her own, looking and acting a
trifle out of the conventional. In the
evening she may join a too gay party,
one of the sort that never has a chap-
At other times she may affect the man
nish suit, and, when at home with a
friend, she may, just to be sociable, smoke
a cigarette.
These are the indiscretions of the new
woman, but, after all, are they as bad as
the Indiscretion of the old woman?
The old woman flirts desperately behind
her paint and powder, while she crticizes
the mannish new woman; but the mannish
new woman knows that she is at heart
twice as honest as the married flirt who
screens her smiles behind the fan.

The old woman on the other hand al

there are more Indiscretions committed
by the conventional woman, living with
her mother, than by all the new women

The conventional woman thinks that she

PARIS, July 16.â 1t is almost easy
to calculate the number of people
who will visit Paris from Amer
ica during the first three months
of the coming exposition of 1900.
The capacity of steamships is
fixed, and even this year, when there is
no such attraction as the Paris exposi
tion, the steamships are carrying as
many passengers as they will hold.
It is fair to estimate that the average
price, paid for a first-cabin passage will
it-- $110. Rates will range from $50 for
inside staterooms on the slow ships to
$65 for the very cheapest rooms on the
fast boats. On the big liners there will
be no rate under $65 for first cabin, and
very few berths will be for sale at that
price. From it the passage prices will
run up to $200 for a single person in the
best staterooms, and as high as $450 for
those few luxurious passengers who are
willing to pay for the privilege of being
alone in the finest cabins. Second-cabin
passage will run about as it does now,
from $40 to $70.
Now as to the matter of expense
after reaching Paris:
There will be, as there always is, a
choice of three modes, of living in the
French capital. One will be in hotels,
of course. One will be "en pension," or
in boarding houses. The third will be
in "chambres meubles," or furnished
rooms, taking meals outside. The Pa
risian hotel varies as widely in its price
as does the New York hotels. In the
grand new Palace Hotel, which has re
cently been erected on the Champs
Elysee and is the most beautiful hostel
ry in the world, rates now range from
$2 50 to $10 per room per day. This, of
course, does not include meals. The
cost of meals at the Palace is about $1
for breakfast, $1 50 for luncheon and $2
for dinner. On the other hand, there
are scores of pleasant little hotels scat-

tered throughout Paris where one can
secure comfortable rooms for from 80
cents to Â§1 50 a day. The first Parisian
breakfast consists of coffee and rolls
only, and by the economical person can
be secured for 30 cents. The second
breakfast, or dejeuner, can be pur
chased by the same person for from 50
cents to To cents. 'inner in moderate
priced restaurants ranges from 75 cents
to $1. In French carding houses one
can make rates by the day as well
by the week. In one which I know of,
where the rooms are pleasant. *he at

can be desired, the rates run from $1 60
POSSIBILIES OF
BtJDDING authors all over the land
and those who have long since
, _^/ bloomed are bidding for favor in
the literary world through the me
dium of the romantic novel, so-called. And
what is the romantic novel? Providing
characters with past-century wardrobes,
giving them swords and a swashbuckler
stride, weighting their tongues more or
less heavily with old English, quaint
roundabouts and inversions, and setting
them down in the midst of picturesque if
somewhat licentious courts, does not of
necessity create a romantic atmosphere.
The spirit Of audacity must be there, ar.'i
no scenic effect will supply it. Or that
other spirit, sometimes mistaken for the
melodramatic by those whose experience
has not fitted them to know what terrible
emotions may sometimes stir the soul of
man: the spirit which in one of the old
romances prompts the hero to tear open
a woman's grave and remove one side of
her coffin that he may really lie beside
her in death. Many a feeble pen is
scratching itself on to oblivion in a mad
race for something it will never catch -a
spirit elusive as the Zelt-geist; and when
the mediocre reach for it It takes flight
and Is gone. Anthony Hope has caught it,
and Stanley Weyman, and, to a less de
gree, Arthur Marchmont. It gives color
and charm to the tales of S. Wier Mitch
ell, and lovingly It hovered over Charles
Reade when he wrote "Cloister and
Hearth." now seldom read, metre's the
pity. Of a lifetime of deep study Reade
has here given us -â fruit, yet without'
that pedant cooking which doth breed
indigestion. 'Tis the fresh peach, not the
dried one stewed.- â ;'â  : '-.
The tale is long, and In these days we
are ln a hurry; but there are no better
characters to-day being drawn than dear,
kind, rough and tender Denys of Bur
gundy, with his proper wisdom and his
proper follyâ and Margaret, whose trials
we follow with anxious heart until she
wceps-at last at having found a bosom to
cry on. Then there is Catherine, that not
unmixed blessing, and Sir Petard. Master
Giles and Kate, ye little oracle, and last
of all Gerard, who cannot be dismissed
with a few scratches of the quill. What
touch of nature can clutch the .heart more
forcibly than when hard old Brother
Jerome lays the tress of hair in Gerard's
coffin? "When the coffin was to be closed
he cleared the cell and put the tress upon
the dead man's bosom. 'There, Clement,'
said he to the dead -face, and set himself
a penance for doing it, and nailed the
coffin himself." If any excuse Is needed
for speaking of "Cloister and Hearth"
when new publications are yearning for
review, It may be said ln defense that we
6__^._ufiK& .-fljprove by going bs.ck. and
a day up to about $5 SN-ilay. The dif
ference in rates depends not so much on
the quality of the room which one se
cures as on the number of flights of
stairs one must climb before reaching
it. There are very few pensions in Paris
which are provided with elevators, al
though most of them are from Aye to
seven stories high. Furnished rooms in
respectable neighborhoods, with good
attendance and candles, can be hired as
low as three francs a day, and from
that price the visiting American can go
as much higher as he pleases.
These are the prices of the ordinary
season. Add to them 15 per cent and
you will have an idea of about what
will be charged during the exposition
year.
With these figures at hand it will
not be difficult to form an estimate of
about what the lowest cost of a com
fortable trip to the Paris Exposition
and maintenance while here will cost.
Take the lowest cabin figuresâ each
wayâ that gives $100 for steamer tick
ets, to which must be added $20 for tips
and expenses on the steamer, making in
all $120 for transportation -over and
back on a ten-day boat. In Paris, as
I have already explained, about the
cheapest way of living respectably
would be in a furnished room, taking
meals outside. In this way 11 francs
a day, or about $2 50, can be made to
cover the cost of maintenance. Tickets
to the exposition will cost 5 francs, or
$1. each.
And no matter how many of us come
over here, we are all likely to be pretty
comfortable. Paris, gay and beau
tiful at its worst, will be at its best
and will be gayer and more beautiful
than ever. The exposition 'will neither
begin nor end with the exposition
grounds. This will to a large extent
be due to the fact that, unlike our
World's Fair at Chicago, the grounds
of the great iris show are located al
most in the heart of the most beautiful
part of the city. The same French
Government which will call out fifteen
thousand men to protect its President

with an artist who was present with

This is the apex of Jo* to have one b
book dramatized, and by far the best
plays of tlie year arc- the ones drawn
from romantic novel sources. Charles
Major possesses in perfection the power
of expressing the romantic lii the simplest
way. His book is full of action, yet there
is never a strain for effect Never the
thought of manuscript written for serial
publication, with hairbreadth escapes at
regular "to be continued" intervals. A
man to write in his refreshing way has
a long ancestry of hours of ceaseless ef
forts of self-culture, guided by an inner
consciousness. a seeing of things Invisible
to most of us. Such effort! with such
guidance, are silent prayers, and they are
not uttered on the knee.
The most cunning ladder that literary
training can fashion will full to reach
without a round or two of temperament
added. The destiny of the true romantic
novel is playwise to the stage, and the
chance of being chosen is spurring all lit
erary workers onto their best efforts.
Since but few will meet this happy fate it
is well to be sure that th*- very best have
ice i, selected. "When Knighthood Was in
Flower" and "The Gadfly" ore two of the
wisest selections of the year. The former,
being dramatised by Henry Guy Carleton
for Julia Marlowe, is sure to make the
stir In the dramatic world that the book
has in tic- literary. A great consideration
for commercial purposes Is the title of a
play, and short titles, once considered
best, are no longer ln favor. The book In
question was not originally so named, but
John Curtis, who first read and passed fa
vorably upon the manuscript, was not sat
isfied with Its rather commonplace orig
inal christening, and so he went to, poet
ical sources for a better. He came upon
one in an unexpurgatcd copy of Leigh
Hunt's poems. The couplet from which
lt was taken reads:
"There lived a knight, when knighthood
was in flower.
Who charmed alike the tilt-yard and the
bower."
And many a reader has been won by the
Inviting selection. Poetry Is an excellent
source to glean titles from, for it runs the
gamut of every emotion known and un
known to the soul of man. For Miss Mar
lowe it is fortunate that Mr. Major has
lived and written, for Mr. Major, since his
work is to be dramatized, It is fortunate
that Miss Marlowe has lived and acted.

me that there will be thirty miles of
streets more beautifully decorated than

Out on the Avenue Rapp are the
splendid offices of the American com

Commissioner Peck wag away, but
smooth-faced, pleasant-mannered Com
missioner Woodward told me that the
plans for the American pavilion had
that day been approved by the special
Are department which had been or
ganized for the exposition. He showed
me the design for the facade, but was
not at liberty to permit Its publica

of the Administration building at the

may have been the feeling at France
toward America at the time of the
Spanish-American war, and whatever
may be the general sentiment of the
people of France toward the people of
America now, France has certainly
shown the greatest desire to be agree
able to our commissioners and gener
ous to our exhibitors.
Notwithstanding differing reports
concerning the amount of space allot
ted to America by the Paris managers,
the fact remains that America has been

given a larger floor area than any other
one exhibiting nation; and when the
space on which our pavilion will stand
was dedicated in the presence of Com
missioner Peck and his staff the
Frenchman in charge turned courte
ously to the commissioner and said:
"Gentlemen, you are on American soil;
you need not cross the ocean to be ln
your native land.- France welcomes the
presence of this small piece of Ameri
can territory as she ever has and ever
will welcome the citizens of your coun
try." â¢
The American pavilion will have a
floor area of 75x90 feet. There will be
four stories, and .aside from the offices
of the commissioner general and his
staff of twelve commissioners for 1900
the building will be practically a home
for visiting Americans. There will be
reading-rooms, resting-rooms, smok-
Ing-rooms, toilet-rooms, a bureau for
guides indorsed by the commissioner, a
branch of the New York Cha..iber of
Commerce, facilities for exchanging
money, and offices of American express
companies. Even with all these things,
there will be space left to be utilized.
It is probable that this will be divided
into rooms for separate States and
groups of States, in which one of the
pleasantesl features will be complete
files of home papers.
I asked Commissioner Woodward what
he thought would be the finest Ameri
can exhibit.
"Probably machinery and electricity,"
he replied. "I expect America to take
more space in those sections than in
any other. In one field, which was at
the beginning essentially French, we
have made marked inroads. Our ex
hibit of American automobiles will be
extremely fine.
"Another and very gratifying exhibit
will be that which our painters will
make. Our share of the art section will
unquestionably be a revelation to
France. There is something fine in
thinking that America, the newest of
the countries, will come over here and
do something in the very art center of
the Old World which will be striking
and meritorious. The man in charge
of the work of collection and arrange
mentâJohn B. Cauldwell of New York
âwill, I am sure, please everybody.
"Some of the State exhibits will be
very flne. California is particularly
proud of its horticultural interests:
New York Is anxious to show its great
strides in the path leading toward
popular education, lowa and Illinois
have both appropriated large sums to
ward making their agricultural display
perfect and developing the Idea of es
tablishing experiments in kitchen and
cooking work. These two States will
especially emphasize the advantage of
corn as a food product. Corn is little
known over here, and the Frenchmanâ
who always likes good things to eatâ
will open his eyes and smack his lips
when he tastes our American corn
muffins.
The American Government and the
various State governments will official
ly spend more than $3,000,000 on the ex
position. The Federal appropriation
amounts to $1,200,000, and in addition to

It is pleasant for an American who
knows aught of our World's Fair of
1894 to contemplate the exposition

wholly because of the circumscribed

Volumes of short stories are a grateful
boon to the busy man and woman in this
workaday world, and when they are pow
erful or Interesting or cleverly written or
full of delightful thoughts they are doubly
grateful. George Cable, who uses the
most decorative language In his tales, has
given us in "The Solitary" a short story
of wonderful allegorical beauty. It con
tains the moral biography of many
struggling human souls whose only salva
tion lies. in finding out In time that the
the temptations of life are too strong for
many, and that "they must keep their
world trimmed down to where they can
run barefoot on the sand," if they would
rise above the brute. The story is found
in "Strong Hearts." a somewhat recent
publication. "The Carcelllni Emerald," by-
Mrs. Burton Harrison, is another book of
short stories, deriving its name from the
least Interesting tale in the publication,
possessing dramatic but no literary value
whatever. "An Author's Reading and
Its Consequences" Is by far the best of the
group, and an excellent best It Is, giving
a singularly human coloring to a phase of
life familiar to us allâ the struggle for
supremacy in a women's literary club.
The names selected for the characters are
very happy hits. "A Girl of the Period"
and "A Stolen Stradlvarius" are also very
clever tales. The short story, the multum
in parvo, is not for all to write, but it is
good for man to find when he Is lagging
and beginning to be bored and Inclined to
take a pessimistic view of life at large.

MEMOIRS OF THE CAMPAIGN OF
SANTIAGOâ By . James A. Moss. (The
Mysell-Rolllns Company, San Francisco.)
The following dedication fully explains
the purposes of the work:
"The publication of this unpretentious
booklet is actuated by the sole desire of
placing a fitting souvenir in the hands
of the officers and the men by whose side
the author endured the hardships and
faced the dangers of the campaignâ the
gallant officers who did their duty with
becoming modesty: the brave negro sol
diers who never hesitated at the command
to advance, nor faltered at the order to
charge, but who, with Implicit faith and
confidence followed wherever their white
officers led. With affectionate respect,
buildings will be superb, two particu
larly â great and 'Ittle palaces which
will glare fine and almost virgin white
on the Champs Elysee after they are
finished will be finer than anything
that Chicago had. This is not because
of their impressive design, nor because
of their tremendous size, but because
of the fact that they have been con
structed of solid stone, without any of
the subterfuges usually resorted to In
exposition buildings, and are planned
to remain permanent after the Paris
show of 1900 has passed into one of the
memories of the great French capital.
From the same vast subterranean tract
In which the Catacombs grin gloomily
horrid beneath the city the stone for
these buildings has been excavated in
tremendous blocks, soft and almost
workable as clay. Before the exposure
to the air hardens it this pleasant sand
stone can be easily carved into those
delightful designs of which the French
sculptors are so thoroughly the mas
ters.
You can saw this stone with cross
cut saws, as they saw logs in the for
est of Michigan. You can chip it with
axes as the American carpenter chips
his timber with his adze. It is scarce
ly less easy to handle than wood is, and
has the whiteness and beauty of mar
ble after it has been placed in posi
tion. The whole tremendous inclosure
in which these great buildings are be
ing constructed shines and glitters
bllndingly from the white dust of this
strange stone.
These buildings form a group by
themselves and between them will be
the beginning of the exposition's great
aver-ue. From them it will reach to
the Alexander Bridge, a magnificent
structure of iron and carved stone,
more than twice as wide as any other
bridge in Paris. This bridge is J he
very climax of the Russian frenzy
which oppressed Paris two years ago
when the. Czar paid his respects to
the French capital. Its iron work and
its stone work are full of designs and
symbols indicating the fact that It
was planned in honor of the Czar.
France is somewhat uncertain in her
foreign relations with the balance of
the world, and what she would do with
this marvelous bridge in case the cor
diality now existing between herself
and Russia should suddenly cease Is
an interesting matter for speculation.
Not far above it a great embankment
has been built out into the Seine, which
will carry one .of the .most interesting
groups of buildings in the entire expo
sition. These will represent Old Paris.
Stuccoed and brow*n-beamed. high

visitor of next year a glimpse of the

THE PEDAGOGUES. A story of the
Harvard Summer School. By Arthur
Stanwood Pier. (Small, Maynard & Co.,

expect to find In any summer school.
George C. Gorch and Jessie Deagle come
from Peru, 0. , to study at the Harvard
Summer School. Gorch comes for pur
poses of serious study, and Jessie merely
because he does, the two being* affianced
lovers. Jessie falls ln love with Palatine,
the English instructor, who seems at first
something of a prig. She believes Pala
tine reciprocates her affections and
leads poor Gorch on to the same belief.
Gorch seeks revenge through the medium
of a theme, and thus gives Palatine the
opportunity to show himself tha better
needed to go armed to avoid assassina
tion; the Paris in which the nation's
rulers were changed as easily as the
Parisian of to-day chancres his coat; the
Paris where intrigue and plotting and
conspiring only gave way to such
gorgeous fetes as we never see to-day.
Across the bridge, with the gilded dome
of the Hotel dcs Invalides. its clime*-,
the great avenue continues ' :tween
buildings which will doubtless be
beautiful when the time comes, but
which at this stage look unmistakably
cheap and tawdry. Flapping muslin,
partially applied stucco, gaping win
dowsâail the flimsy detail of temporary
structuresâ show now unpleasantly.
But, amazing as it seems to the visitor,
the committee in charge has formally
announced to the American commission
that these buildings will be the first to
be ready for occupancy, and that exhib
itors may plan on bee-tinning to move in
by the latter part of next month. The
Paris exposition will, it is promised, be
that unique thing among shows of its
kindâ an exhibition which will be ready
at the moment advertised.
Slightly beyond and to the right of
the Hotel dcs Invalides is the old
Eiffel tower, not less majestic in its
skeleton tracery of iron than it was in
the gay days of the great show of '89.
Around it will be clustered the many
curios which the Ingenious Frenchman
has devised for the entertainment of
his guests in 1900. Here will be the
great telescope which of itself deserves
an entire article. Here, also, will be
the only artificial body of water which
the Exposition will have to showâ a lit
tle lake and a waterfall, in sad contrast
to the great lagoons and twisting wa
terways of the Chicago exposition. Not
far away the Electric Palace will
gleam gorgeously with its colored glass
and running water. What will bear
an exaggerated resemblance to the
wild hilarity of Chicago's Midway
will also be located in this neighbor
hood.
The most elaborate preparations are
being made by the Parisian authori
ties for handling th- crowds. An elec
tric underground railway is in course
of construction and indeed nearly
completed. It will consist of a tunnel
lined with white tile, and will, of
course, because of its modern motive
power, be entirely free from smoke
and other disagreeable features. This.
in connection with the already existing
street car lines and omnibus routes,
will furnish ample street transporta
tion. The Parisian cab system is well
nigh perfect, also, and will be greatly
improved one way and another for the
exposition year. The rate is fixed. A
trip, long or short, in a Paris cab costs
30 cents. The rate by the hour is 40
cents.
Taken all in all it is doubtful if any
one visiting the Paris Exposition from
America will be disappointed. Even at
this stage of its preparation it is easy
to see that it will be a great and mar
velous show.

CURING CANCER BY FREEZING WITH LIQUID AIR
REMARKABLE SURGICAL EXPERIMENTS BY DR.
. A. CAMPBELL WHITE OF VANDERBILT CLINIC,
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, IN WHICH LIQUID AIR
' HAS SUPERSEDED X-RAYS AS THE NEWEST
MARVEL HOW IT IS APPLIED AND REASONS
WHY IT EFFECTS SUCH WONDERFUL CURES.
Copyrighted, 1899.
Â»â * y !",v YORK, July 28.â Dr. A.
/\{ Campbell White of Vanderbilt
I \ clinic, Columbia University, is
V preparing to announce the re
sults of a series of remarkable
experiments which he has been making
with liquid â for the treatment of
cancer, erysipelas, lupus, carbuncles
and other diseases. He has actually
cured a number of severe cases of ery
sipelas, carbuncles and boils in one or
two treatments. Abscesses and ulcers
he has .aborted absolutely with a single
freezing. Neuralgia and sciatica he has
treated most successfully, in every case
giving almost Instant and permanent
relief. An obstinate case of lupus â
lupus is a form of tuberculosis affecting
the skin â was, perfectly cured after two
treatments, although the patient had
been under ordinary medical attend
ance for a long time, the disease resist
ing every- remedy. Uut the most signifi
cant ond important feature of all Dr.
White's work has been his experiments
With cancer.
It is fortunate that these experi
ments, which promise to give liquid air
the prominence in surgical and medical
circles formerly held by Roentgen's X
rays, should have been conducted un
der such auspices as those of the medi
cal start of the Vanderbilt clinic. Dr.
White has been assisted by Dr. Thurs
t<;. Dusk and his associates of
?evelt Hospital and by Dr. George
M. "ox, the distinguished authority on
skm diseases.
Dr. White has been conducting spe
cial clinics twice a we for several
months past. The liquid air is supplied
by Charles E. Triplet - , the inventor of
the process, which has made his name
familiar. It reaches the clinic in a
heat-insulated can containing about
one gallon, the cost being hardly more
than that of mineral water. It is a
clear, bluish fluid which evaporates'
rapidly on exposure to the heat of the
surrounding atmosphere. Its tempera
ture is 312 degrees below zero.
Last week I visited Dr. White at his
clinic. Among the patients present one
had a very severe case of cancer, one
of erysipelas and one of blood tumors.
The erysipelas patient was a young ne
gro woman who had come to the clinic
three days before with her face ter
ribly swollen and disfigured. Dr. White
had applied liquid air, doubtful as to
its efficacy, an.l she had returned so
much improved, the swelling being en

tirely gone, that the doctor actually
did not know her. He gave her one
final treatment, using a glass flask
partly filled with the liquid air. This
he rolled over her. face up and down,
The surface of the flesh was frozen
stiff and white as the glass passed over
It, but it regained its former condition
almost instantly. The temperature
used was nearly 300 degrees colder than
ice, perfectly dry cold, so cold, indeed,
that 'hi doctor had difficulty in hand
ling the flask. And yet, when I asked
the patient if It hurt her, she said that
she only experienced a slight stinging
sensation. ,
"It completely anesthetizes the part
to which it is applied without freezing
it solid," explained Dr. White; i have
tried th air as a local anesthetic in
a number of cases and it has always
worked admirably. No blood flows
during the operation -a very great ad
vantage to the surgeon in his work. I
operated not long ago on a boy who
had a blank cartridge wound in his
hand. The boy was very nervous. I
applied the liquid air rather too freely,
and when I attempted to cut the hand
with a scalpel it. was frozen so hard
that the knife would not penetrate.
Thirty seconds later, however, it
thawed out and the operation was per,
formed without pain, without heir.ON
rhage and with no further freezing.
When the boy returned a few days
later the wound was in perfect condi
tion and it was soon healed up. That
is only one of several similar cases."
The cancer case which 1 saw was
that cf a woman about 65 years old.
The cancer was well advanced, having
drawn down the corner of the patient's
eye. She had tried all manner of treat
ment to reduce the growth, and as
a last resort had come to Dr. White.
His treatment was simplicity itself,
He placed a little liquid air in a* wide
bottom flask, the cork of which was
pierced with two holes. Through one
of these holes a glass tube reached to
the bottom of the flask, the outer end
being curved like a spout and th. tip
drawn together until the aperture was
not larger than a 'pencil point. On
placing his thumb over the other hole
in the cork the expanding air within
the flask drove the liquid aid through
the spout in a fine spray. This froze
the surface of the cancer white, and if
continued long enough in one spot
would have cauterized it like a hot
iron.
"Our usual treatment," said Dr.
White, "is by means of this spray, al
though we sometimes use a swab made
of cotton and dipped in the air.' The
swab is especially desirable when we
wish to move tissue, such as a wart."
In this particular case of cancer the
patient had been treated only once, but
she said that her face felt better* and
Dr. White said he saw marked im
proverâ¢ in the condition of the can
cerous tissue. The treatment for the
most part, although the cancer was
frozen solid, was not painful.
Dr. White explained that while the
flesh was frozen it was not frost bit
ten, and that it would recover its for
mer state. Only wet cold causes frost
bite, whereas liquid air is absolutely
dry. Dr. White tells of an experiment
in which the ear of a live rabbit was
completely frozen by placing it in
liquid air. It was so stiff that a piece
easily snapped off in the lingers with
out pain and without any flow of blood.
In ten minutes circulation was re-estab
lished and the ear regained its former
temperature and color.
Dr. White has been making careful
investigations to explain this power
fully curative action of liquid air. He
has come to the conclusion, that the
air does not kill the germs of the va
rious diseases: it is not an antiseptic,
not a germicide. Although a tempera
ture of 160 degrees of heat destroys all
germ 'life Dr. White has discovered
from careful experiments in the New-
York Department of Health Hospital
that even the cold of liquid air, 312
degrees below zero, will not injure the
germs if typhoid fever, anthrax and
diphtheria. He submitted all of these
germs, not only directly to the liquid
air, but immersed them in the air in
glass tubes. In every case the bacilli
germinated when removed from the ef
fects of the intense cold. Dr. Huddles
ton tried liquid air on vaccine virus
and found that it was affected by
short exposures no more than the
germs. Professor McKendrick has
found that even the seeds of common
plants like cucumbers, wheat, squash
and so on will germinate almost as
well as ever after being submitted to
a cold of 300 degrees below zero. Lord
Kelvin, in discussing the origin of life
on this planet, once suggested that the
first seeds may have been brought here
through the cold of interstellar space
in a meteor, although he didn't explain
how the seeds could find their way
Into the meteor in the first place.
If, then, liquid air is not a germicide

where does It gt-t its cu-ious and won-

"You must remember," explains Dr.
White, "that liquid air is over 400 de-

no other means than its application
could we produce so sudden ana *?x-

This mistake of ours was -set right about
the close of the war with Spain, or a lit
tle before its close. And lt happened as
follows:
Late In- the spring of 1898. Jeannette
Brennan was showing signals of distress
and she let it be understood that the
cause of her distress was Frank Pilsbury.
It appeared that he was making love to
her, chiefly by giving her a great deal of
his societyâ with advice on millinery mat
tersâand also by presenting her with
flowers, but not artificial millinery flow
ers, but. real ones. All this bored Jean
nette, and, as Jeannette was a good sort
of girl we boys said that It ought to-be
put a stop to. Besides, Jeannette was by
public opinion assigned to be the fate of
one Robinson, who was not at all a fool.
like Pilsbury, and was a general favorite.
About this time it was reported that
Letitia Helmund had at last yielded to the
persistency of Fred Stimms' wooing and
had allowed him to call It an engagement.
Then a | number of the boys enlisted for
the war, Fred among them, Frank Pils
bury not. Everybody slapped Fred on
the back and called him a good gellow.
Everybody felt sorry for Letitia Helmund,
because Fred had gone to Tampa and was
being eaten by mosquitoes, and everybody
felt sorry for Jeanette because Frank
would not expose his perfect complexion
to the ravages of these spiteful Insects.
Lati-tca Hcdmund* was present one day
only to dilate forcibly on the removal
of the spray. Cold also retards the
activity of bacteria and this, with the

although the subject has as yet received
comparatively little attention. He inti-

when somebody said. "Can't we make
Frank Pilsbury go off to the war? Can't
we bring public opinion to bear on him?"
Letitia sighed, thinking, no doubt, of
poor Fred broiling and being eaten at
Tampa. Then she said, in her gentle, mu
sical way. "If everybody wants poor
Frank Pilsbury out of the way, why not
get him to go to Tampa?"
"Do you think he could be persuaded to
go that far?"
"I think he might,' said Letitia.
Why was it that nobody had thought of
this before? Frank Pilsbury was, by emi
nence, the squire of dames among us. Le
titla's plan was simply to go off herself to
Tampa so as to be near poor, heroic Fred,
and to make Frank go with her as escort.
Jeannette thanked her with tears of grati
tude. Everybody called the plan an in
spiration of genius and also a huge joke.
The Idea of making pretty Frank go to
that abominable* den of mosquitoes and
hold a sunshade over Lctitla's head so
that Fred might make love to her in peace
between drills!
And Frank consented like a lamb. And
the two started together amid the cheers,
and also the jeers, of all the girls and of
all the boys who had not gone to the front
before them.
The next we heard of those three was by
letter. First from Letitia to Jeannette,
like this:
"Frank Pilsbury has proved a devoted
and. useful escort. I don't know what I
should have . done without him. Fred
laughs at him and wonders what he does
with himself down 1 here, but I tell Fred
that If it had not been for 'my little dude,'
as he calls him. I could not be here. And
It is a great thing to be near one's soldier
boy, isn't it? So I have much to thank
'my little dude' f0r." ..'... '.-v*
Then from Fred Stimms:
"Letitia is up at the hotel, and I see
her about every day. Frank Pilsbury is
all right. He keeps out of the way when
Letitia and I aTe together, which is what
he's here for, I guess. We call him the
chaperon. I don't know how he puts in
his time, except It's loafing on the hotel
veranda and about the Cuban settlement.
They say he talks Spanish like a dago."
Just before .the transports started for
Cubaâ the second, week in Juneâ
should turn up at home but Letitia!
Everybody said she had done right not
to stay till the' very' last. The parting
would have been too severe a trial for her
nerves. She did not bring back Frank
Pilsbury with her. She seemed to have
mislaid him somewhere and could not tell
where ho bad sot to.
mates that In the near future a place
will be arranged, probably in some hos

a liquid air hospital, so that physicians
can take their patients to it as they

R. COLLIER.
About the end of July the news from
Cuba was becoming very excitingâ the
news in the papers. Privately the follow
ing came from the United States camp
near Santiago. It was dated "Daignon,
June 27." It was a letter to a mutual
friend of Stimms and myself. This is a
true copy: "Dear Con: I am not well.
A good many of us in camp here are .n
the same fix. It Isn't the miss of my reg
ular n-eals that hurts me, it is the shock
I have had. A lot of Garcla's soldiers
met us on the beach when we landed.
They were cheering for ios Americanos.'
One of them, in a big straw hat and a
little less ragged shirt and trousers than
the others, with a revolver and a big
machete, came forward and shook hands
with me. Then he said, 'How is Letitia?'
Then I saw that it was Frank Pilsbury.
He sneaked off from Tampa three weeks
ago with some sort of dispatches for the
Cubans and they say he landed at Ma
tanzas and made his way right across
the island. I couldn't believe it, but Gar
cia has photographs that he took on the
way. Frankie has one of those little
dinky 'Slap-bang' cameras with him. The
Cubans are afraid of him and think he
is the President's eldest son. The Span
lards took him for an English tourist.
Now they are going to fit him out with
decent clothes and send him to Washing
ton. How he did it all I don't know. I
suppose it was his Spanish and getting so
chummy with all those stiff dudes up at
the hotel. I can't write any more. The
shock seems to have given me a chill.
I believe we shall be fighting to-morrow.
Hope I may get killed. Yours, Fred
Stimms."
This letter set us all in a ferment of
excitement. Everybody went and asked
Letitia for information. Everybody felt
that there must be more mystery behind
this. Letitia smiled and said she had lost
sight of Frank during the latter part of
her stay at Tampa. She supposed the
Government must have sent him on some
special mission to Cuba, because he had
traveled there before tbe war was ever,
thought of and knew the country a little.
I think we all felt somewhat annoyed.
Jeanette unaccountably got downright
angry and began treating Robinson, who
had been obliged to stay at home on ac
count of his mother and sister, very un
kindly. ;â .-:.
Poor Fred had one consolation, and that
was that Frank was not at Santiago on
the Ist of Julyâ had. in fact, started home
with his mysterious dispatches several
days before that. Fred's friends also had
the consolation that Fred, In spite of his
own gloomy ambitions, came out of all
that fighting without a scratch, though he
did go to grass later on with a severe at
tack of fever.
By the Fourth of July Frank came home
a little browner and less plump than be

"The results of my cancer treat
ments," he said, "are full of promise. It
is undoubtedly a fact that the applica
tion of liquid air will relieve the agonlz
ing pain of a cancer. This has been
proven beyond a doubt. Its use will in
many cases retard the advance of the
disease, and I am confident that in cer
tain forms of cancer it is curative. It is
quite remarkable that up to this time
the use of liquid air has not been fol
lowed by any bad results."

When we asked him to tell us about his
mysterious goings on, he said he was sick
and tired of all that: the Cubans, he said,
were very dirty. Then he wandered off
into a discussion of the metropolitan fash
lons in millinery.
The next thing he did was to rent a
small house.
Then the local papers printed an au
thorized statement of the marriage of
Frank Pilsbury and Miss Letitia Helmund
at Tampa, Fla.. on the 22d day of May,
1808. with full particulars.
When somebody asked him what he
meant by breaking the heart of Jeanette
Brennan, he answered: "Her heart, Is not
broken. Ask Robinson. That was a russ,
you know. Public opinion was against my
marriage with Letitia, so we had -to elude
public opinion. Ask Letitia."
Letitia. being examined, said: "I never
gave Mr. Stimms authority to say we
were engaged. He chose to give it out,
and it was not my business to contradict
him. Yes, the Matanzas expedition was
my idea. Still, Frankie isn't half such a
fool as he looks."
Fred came home an invalid long before
the other soldier boys. For three 'weeks
we all conspired to keep the news from
him, so that the shock might not kill him.
When he heard the whole truth he packed
up and went to the Pacific coast.BY MYSTERIOUS WAYS NATIVE HAWAIIANS PREDICT VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS.

peculiar and highly venerated reck is
as follows:
From the time that the Hawaiian Isl

of the blue Pacific. Pele, the goddess of
volcanoes, has been engaged in waging
the fiercest nd most unrelenting war
upon Akua-manu, the shark god, who is
really the Neptune, or ocean ruler of
Hawaiian mythology. From her throne
on the highest peak of the island moun

The soft ripple of the placid waters

mockery on her jealous ears; the roar
of the waves under the frown of storm
clouds, has been a challenge.
And so it has been that time after

inaction, gained confidence in her own

to the shore upon rivers of molten rock
and endeavored with all the forces at
her command to overwhelm and ut

DISCOVERY OF THE QUEEREST MICROBE OF THEM ALL
IN far away Japan a short time ago
there came to light under the micro
scope of S. Hashimoto the strangest
microbe known to exist. It has the
power of changing its shape and
color'with the rapidity of lightning and
no explanation of how the changes take
place can be made.
According to the report Hashimoto
was working with germ cultures. He

after the plate had been some days ln

His first work was merely an inspec

spread on a slide and stained. Under
the microscope the plate was a surprise.
Bacteria of all sizes. and the strangest
shapes appeared by thousands, but it

of changing into a number of different
shapes.
After many days of work Hashimoto
came to the conclusion that when in a
quiescent state the new microbe was
nothing more than a small motile rod.
The most powerful microscope failed to
reveal any structure in this rod. It was
as smooth and polished as the stinger

solitude, nurse the hope of ultimate
vengeance.
But one day a strange and sorrow
ful event occurred. Pele, after mak
ing one of these unsuccessful battle
expeditions t0... the edge of Akua
manu's kingdom, returned home more
than usually downcast, and after a
period of deepest mourning became the
mother of a son in whom were com
bined the natures of both herself and
the sea god. A being who was the em
bodiment of the mighty possibilities in
the way of destruction possessed by
both fire and water, and whose very
existence sprung from violence and
wickedness, could not gain the affec
tion of even such a mother as the
mighty but unlovable ruler of fiery
floods.
From the moment of his birth Pele
hated her son with all the strength of
her ungentle nature; and as soon as
might be she drove him forth and.
turning him to stone by her magic pow
er, condemned him t" remain forever
a sentinel at the Inner doors of her
stronghold, and the guardian of the
sacred pool which, fed through hidden
channels, is kept ever full of water
heated by subterranean fires.
This is the native story of Kuoo
mauna, and, if it be true, most faith

mands, for year after year, and cen
tury after century, he has stood stern
and Immovable where she imperiously
stationed him and bade him stay until
either she or his hated father gained
the decisive victory for which they are
both still struggling.
Silent as he is. however, and h-rsh
as has been fierce Pele's discipline, he
has found a way to in some small de
gree revenue himself upon her by be
traying to those who have eyes to see
and minds to read his secret messages,
some of the secrets which she tries to
hide within the fiery underground laby
rinths over which she holds undisputed
sway.
There are many natives, both kahu
nas and common people, who, by cer
tain signs known in their entirety only
to themselves, can infallibly foretell
when an eruption is about to take place
from any part of the mountains about
which they make their homes. One of
the principal signs on which they de
pend, and the only one of which they
will speak to a foreigner, is the peculiar
rise in temperature which, when an
outbreak is impending, is observed to
take place in various water-filled fis
sures along the coast and up on the des
olate mountain sides.
From Wal-o-Akua, the Bath of the
Gods, which lies in the Puna district of
Hawaii at the foot of a lava precipice
that is covered with strange and unac
countable figures and characters resem
bling Aztec hieroglyphics, to the pool
over which Kuoomauna holds especial
sovereignty, they all tellâ through the
fact that their ordinarily tepid waters
become without apparent cause, raised
almost tc boiling â the story of
coming fire-floods.
So it is that Kuoomauna manages
through underground channels to warn
the natives of approaching danger; and
so it is thrtt, chained to one spot though
he be by cruel Pele's imperial decree, he
yet to this extent has both the courage
and the power to defy her.
HIS BRIDE'S PICTURE.
There is a peculiar portrait in Wash
ington which has created much interest
among those who know of its existence.
Its peculiarity is that every year it has
changed to show the changes which
time would have made . in the original.
The portrait is by a Washington artist,
and is that of his wife, and was painted
many years ago, when she was a young
bride.
A few years after the portrait was
painted the young wife died, and so
great, was the grief of the artist that
he determined to keep her likeness
with him all the time, and to do so he
decided, that year by year he would
change the portrait so as to make it
grow t Id with him and thus keep her,
as it were, ever with him.
Every year, on the anniversary of
his wedding day, the artist locks him
self in bis studio and changes the lines
of tile face of the portrait, adding what
he thought would make the difference
of one year. There have been many
anniversaries of that marriage day,
and consequently many changes in the
portrait.
To-day the picture is that of an old
woman, the hair turned gray.

A "LINE RIDER" OF THE MEXICAN BORDER.
FRANK T. CANFIELD, a mounted
inspector â or, "line rider," as such
officials are familiarly called â in
the United States customs serv
ice, has just covered himself with
glory by his clever capture of one
of the most elusive and successful cattle
smugglers on the whole closely watched
stretch of the Mexican border.
This is not Inspector Canfield's first no
table exploit, by any means, for during
the brief year that he has been helping
to "hold down the line' he has performed
several feats of borderland valor which
have won him special distinction even
among his older and more experienced
companions in arms.
Line-riding, over the plains and deserts.
and through canyons, and over the moun
tains, in the southern part of Arizona, is
not a particularly easy job, even at its
best, for it means a seat in a saddle for
a good part of the twenty-four hours: al
most constant exposure to sun. wind or
storm, and a continuous strain of eager
watchfulness, which if relaxed for even a
brief period may lead to the disgrace of
unfulfilled duty. More than this, it means
dangerâ danger ever present and ever
threateningâ a danger that may crystal
lize into a tragedy at almost any moment,
and yet must he faced steadily and
brave and fought against boldly when it
comes too near.
The ordinary Mexican, not being fond of
Americans, anyway, is not a particularly
amiable dividual when interfered with
ln his star performance of cheating the
United States Government out of its
rightful dues. Nor is he angelically for
giving If he or his happen to suffer some
misadventure at the hands of a zealous
customs official.
On the contrary, he is a very disagree
able entity to deal with. He can gener
ally be depended upon to fight like a
crazed wildcat when unkind fat delivers
him over into the hands of his enemies,
and to cherish the memory of even an un
gentle touch with a sullen doggedness
yhlch i.- apt whenever opportunity offers
to find an expression in swift and sure re
venge.
And this ordinary Mexican, be it known,
down there in the land of customs duties,
which Ids ingenuous mind considers were
impose 'I only to give him the trouble of
evading them, looks upon each and every
"line rider" as his own personal and es
pecial enemyâ as Is, perhaps, under ex
isting circumstances, rather natural than
otherwise.
In spite of the foregoing facts, how
ever, the Government has not the slight
est difficulty in filling all the positions in
its gift, even in Southern Arizona and
New Mexico.
There Is something about the wild, free,
adventurous life which appeals to the civ

with a solution consisting of one part of carbolic ac'd to

kept on hand. The commercial carbolic acid is as good as
the refined and is much cheaper. Burn contents and

2. Summer and winter women must wear skirts that
clear the walks by not less than four inches, and five or
six would be better. Avoid all kinds of fur and other
soft trimmings around the lower border of dresses. Ameri
cans are expectorating animals, and all the laws in the
world and all the good advice that may be offered will
serve only to diminish but not eradicate this nuisance.
Note the filth., especially the sputum on the sidewalks.
Skirts dragged through this are taken home, dried, brushed
and cleaned, and thus infection is introduced into the
household.
3. Do not move into a house where your predecessor
was tuberculous without an efficient disinfection of the
premises. To secure such disinfection, have the walls
cleaned of old paper and washed with a solution of mer
curic chloride (bichloride of mercury), one to 1000. The
woodwork should be painted after cleaning with this so
lution, and all floors thoroughly saturated with the same.
The solution is a poison.

It became evident to the mind of the. in
spector at once that these jugs were full
of unauthorized mescal. Now, mescalâ
or nic â  cal, cr mixcal. as it is indifferently
calledâ is the fiery and intoxicating liquor
otherwise known as Mexican whisky,
about which our Government and the
Mexicans do continually disagree. It is
undeservedly popular on both sides of the
nation's southern boundary line, and it
seems a hardship to its manufacturers
and those who deal in it that they should
not be allowed to pass it over the boun
dary without paying for the privilege.
The method cf preparation being simple,
the producing c st is low. Almost any one
can decapitate magueys, roast the cab

oven and, after letting the softened mass
fall apart in the fermenting stage of de
composition, distill the pressed-out juice
or pulque, as the natives call It.
The result is very similar to the strong

est kind of Irish whisky, and both whites
and Mexicans drink it far too freely for
their own good. In Mexico, even paid for
in Mexican silver, It Is ridiculously cheap,
but the duty paid at the line makes a big
difference to the American-side consumer.
If this duty can be evaded even the
profit on a gallon or so of the liquor will
make a Mexican rich for several days,
and it is to prevent this sudden access
of wealth that the line-riders keep such
sharp lookout for itinerant mescal deal
ers.
Canfield, giving his now submissive ani
mal his head, galloped swiftly around the
rock behind which the other rider had
disappeared, and seeing him drawing
away as fast as was possible with his
clumpy load called to him sharply to halt.
The man looked over his shoulder, meas
ured with his eye the distance between him
and his pursuer and then, most unexpect
edly, threw a leg over the back of his
horse, unslinglng a Winchester rifie as
he did so, and as quickly as his feet
touched the ground raised the weapon to
his shoulder and -fired straight at his ad
vancing foe. He missed, of course, but
the effect of his shot was to give Can
field's broncho a new fit of hysterics, in
the midst of which Canfield managed to
dismount and fire at his opponent. The
exciting difficulty of carrying on a battle
of this kind alone In a mountain gorge,
with a frenzied horse trying to pull one's
arm off. and a murderous face looking at
one critically along the shining line of a
rifle that unquestionably means business,
can readily be imagined. But the new In
spector was equal to the occasion.
It was plain that, much as the man be
hind the other rifle evidently would like
to pay off old scores upon his yet unac
climated person and use him for a target,
he was far too excited to do good execu
tion, even had the Inspector's horse al
lowed him to stand still enough to be a
good mark.
Canfield had not been in that section
of the country long enough to learn to
hate "greasers" generically and individu
ally, as most Americans do down there,
and he did not care about bagging, or
even winging, him save in self-defense.
He wanted, however, to spoil him for a
smuggler, for that trip at any rate, and
so he managed to fire another shot,
which hit the Mexican's horse in a vital
spot and laid him low. The broncho be
came simply wild at this second explo
sion directly under his nose and tore him
self away from Canfield's grasp, almost
dragging him to earth. as he did so; but
this move was a lucky one for the in
spector, as the Mexican, using the dead
body of his horse for a breastworks, fired
straight through the place where his head
had been before his terrified steed had
nearly jerked it off.
It was the inspector's turn now, and re
lieved from the necessity of trying to do
" two things at once, he sprang to the shel
ter of a near-by rock, and taking delib
erate aim sent a ball directly through the
conical top of his enemy's sombrero and
followed it up with another one, which
cut off a lock of his flowing hair.
An instant later the Mexican was speed
ing down the rough trail leading to his
own country, and Canfield was left con
queror, In possession, moreover, of ten
gallons of first-class mescal, a fine saddle
and harness and a very excellent rifle,
which the fugitive had filing away in his
flight when he felt the hot breath of the
last bullet sweep across his cheek.
This exhibition of nerve, under trying
circumstances, gave Canfield a high posi
tion in the estimation of his companions,
and he soon showed them that it was by
no means a sporadic attack of bravery,
for within a week he was mixed up in a
similar scrape and acquitted himself quite
as well.
Riding through the mountain with a
companion at night the two came .sud
denly upon three other men. also mounted
and each with a large bundle strapped on
his saddle. Canfleld's cpmpanlon. though
a brave fellow, thought discretion the
better part of valor in this case, as three
desperadoes banded together in an illegal
enterprise would be by no means easy
game, even for an equal number of offi
cers, but Canfield, unwilling to let the
prize slip through his fingers, dashed for
ward with the ringing command, "Hold
up your hands'."
"Hold up ycur hands!" was the reply.
in Spanish, and Canfield, instead of obey
ing this counter challenge, promptly
opened fire, which was returned imme
diately with 200 per cent interest. -Can
field's companion joined in at once, and
the result was a general mix-up for a
few moments, during which bullets flew
thick and fast, one of them going through
Canfleld's coat sleeve and grazing the
flesh, and another slightly wounding the
other inspector's horse, which turned tail
and fled, leaving Canfield to make instant
choice between a hurried retreat and con
tinuing the unequal battle alone.
He decided on the latter course, know
ing that as soon as his fellow-officer could
regain control of his mount he would
come back to his assistance. The moon
had not yet risen and the dim starlight
made it almost impossible to distinguish
the Mexicans from the jetty masses of
rock behind which they were partly shel
tered.
Canfield rode boldly out into the open
trail, with his rifle poised for action and
his finger on the trigger. One of the
Mexicans fired at him instantly, but the
report seemed a double one and was fol
lowed by a shriek of pain, for, aiming at
the flash which marked the shot. Can
field's bullet took such serious effect upon
the smuggler that the next moment a
riderless horse came dashing up the trail
and two Mexicansâ one of them bearing
a limp and apparently lifeless body in
place of the keg of mescal which had
shared his horse's back with him, and
which the officers found among the rocks
later retreated down the slope with
all speed possible. Canfleld's companion,
returning to the fray, met and succeeded
in capturing the runaway and still heav
ily laden steed, and the two inspectors
went back to quarters, very well pleased
with their night's work.
Canfleld's latest adventure was of a
different kind. The smuggling of mescal
is not the only dishonest traffic that goes
"on along the line, though it is, perhaps,
the most annoying to the customs officers.
The reason of this is that it is constantly
indulged in by people to whom the petty
profit of a gallon or so of the fiery liquid
is object enough to make them spend their
days in devising ways in which to outwit
and elude the hated "gringoes" who keep
such sharp watch upon them.
Cattle smuggling is one of the popular
Industries of that region, as it has been
almost ever since the Gadsden purchase
was made, and although the days of the
formerly famous quartetâ "Curly Bill,"
"Billy the Kid." "Russian George" and
"Man-eater Johnson"â are long over, the
memory of their deeds still lives and
A SON WHO WAS
TRULY GRATEFUL
The following story may not have a
moral, or If there be one it may be diffl-
cut to discover, but it has at least the
virtue of being true, and hence possibly
worth telling:
In a certafn office building not far from
La Salle street and Jackson boulevard
was for many years the office of a highly
successful grain and stock broker, a man
who worked early and late for the inter-
ests of his clients, and incidentally for his
own interests. We will call him Mr. Old
Man Broker. He had accumulated, among
the Items of his fortune, a fairly extensive
and very expensive family, consisting of
three daughters and one son.
Mr. Young Man Broker had been sent
to an Eastern seminary and later to Yale
for his education. He had never accom-
plished much as a scholar, but had brought
himself into more or less public notice
in the New England town on numerous
occasions as the leading spirit in unseemly
pranks, and on every such occasion the
old gentleman had come promptly to the
rescue and footed the bills, following up
such action with a letter of very good
advice as to future conduct, which advice
was as regularly pigeonholed by the
young man and never followed.
In course of time and in spite of the
predictions of the good people of various
localities, the young man was duly grad-
uated and came back to Chicago to seek
his fortune. The old gentleman initiated
him into the mysteries of the brokerage
business, gave him $10,000 and told him to
go ahead. Much to the surprise of every
one acquainted with the circumstances,
the young man went ahead and rapidly
forged to the front rank of traders, soon
forms an incentive to others to follow in
their footsteps, as far as may be consid
ering inconvenient present day obstacles.
The cattle driven across the line with
out going through the preliminary cere
mony of paying toll to our Government
are usually animals which have cost their
herders only the trouble of rounding them
up and turning their faces in the desired
direction. Cattle smugglers are usually
cattle thieves also, and the profits of this
business, if properly managed, are so large
as to, in the estimation of the men en
gaged therein, compensate for almost
any damages that may be incurred.
Becoming a little tired of the monotony
of capturing or putting to flight petty
mescal traders, Inspector Canfield deter
mined to see what he could do in the cat
tle line.
Two weeks spent over the border hang
ing around Mexican saloons in the guise
of a ragged and dirty young vagabond,
with no particular Interest In the world
besides mescal and flirtatious native girls
put him in possession of some very inter
esting information, which he managed to
have secretly conveyed to his brother in
spectors across the line.
At the end of three weeKs he was on
friendly terms with two of the "cowboys"
who had helped Colorado Joe the cham
pion "rustler" of that region on several
of his expeditions, and when the next one
started out Customs Inspector Frank T.
Canfield was hired to go along with the
outfit in a sort of "general utility" role.
Smuggling cattle is not a picnic by any
means, for there is the danger of pursuit
from irate cattle owners at the back and
the danger of governmental interference
at the front of the whole surging, panting,
plunging bovine crowd, the edge of which
is a fringe of "strayers" that are con
stantly to be headed off and sent career
ing back into the concrete mass of the
drove.
The hours of work are almost continu
ous, the food is poor and hastily eaten,
but Inspector Canfieldâ known to his new
companions only as "The Kid"â seemed
to care nothing for any of these things.
He even helped break down the barbed
wire fences which interfered with the ex
pedition's necessary progress " 'cross
lots," and did so without swearing any
more earnestly and profusely than his
comrades. It was "a lark" for him, he
declared, and his elders approved of him
and declared admiringly that he had
"grit" and "nerve," and would "get onto
himself" after a while and "amount to
something."
They didn't think so highly of him when
after getting over into Arizona and well
on their way to their stronghold they ran
straight into the arms of a dozen deter
mined men, who seemed almost to spring
out of the ground, so silently and unex
pectedly did they appear, and who made
them prisoners and confiscated their out
fits and stock before any of them could
have said "Jack Robinson," even had he
wanted to.
The high officials of the customs service
look upon Frank Canfield with approving
eyes, but there are those who know the
country and the people well who say that
he has taken his life in his hands by
means of this, his latest and most bril
liant performance.
It is said that a certain little Mexican
girl who is particularly fond of Colorado
Joe thinks, with regret, that it might have
been some careless word of hers, spoken
while the disguised officerâ the hand
some, dirty, ragged, young ne'er-do-well
âwas loafing about her father's drinking
place, that put him on the track of her
lover's plans, and she has sworn revenge:
A Mexican's revenge, as has been said,
is generally swift and sure. It is gen
erally even swifter and more sure when
the Mexican interested is a woman.
But Frank Canfield Is young and brave
â and a bit foolhardy also, perhaps â and
he says that he is not afraid.
becoming a well-known character in the
business.
The panic of 1903 came on, and one
morning Mr. Old Man Broker found that
in spite of everything he could do absolute
ruin was taring him in the face and dis
aster could not be staved off more than
twenty-four hours at the longest estimate,
He had had no direct communication with
his son for several days, but supposed
that he was also hard hit, as he was pop
ularly supposed to be following much the
same line of operation as the old gentle
man. In desperation he addressed a note
to his son and sent it over across the
street by a messenger. The note read:
"My Dear BoyâThe years have all been
in vain. The end is coming soon. It will
finish my career, but I trust you will be
able to turn your talents In other direc
tions and be on your feet again before old
age strikes you. Keep a brave heart and
keep up as long as you can. I fear to tell
your mother the news to-night. Come over
and see me. Your Father."
j- about ten minutes the messenger boy
came back with a sealed envelope, which
the old gentleman tore open nervously,
He read:

There is no need of cultivating a vacant

mark of a vacant mind, in order to avoid
wrinkles, nor yet need one be. like Tenny

"Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendid

Wrinkles are generally believed to bo
the meed of those who have run the
gamut of emotion â who have quaffed
deeply of life's bitters and sweets. They
are not always age betrayers. Youth not
infrequently wrinkles.
It is utterly wrong to suppose that wrin

years, nor will mobile, expressive faces
whereon 'ay the emotions wrinkle any
sooner than the reflectors of passive,
phlegmatic natures.
Nine wrinkles out of ten are caused
frum lack of exercise. The tenth wrinkle,
which is merely a dainty line developed In
the process of character building. Is an
acceptable addition to the face, stamping
it with individuality. lb;' the other nine
wrinkles are base transgressors and

"Yes. but how?" wails tlie unfortunate
possessor of wrinkles.
If you are willing to give some time and
mure patience to the task, you cai rout
any number of wrinkles that have pre
empted brow or cheeks. You can do It
without expensive treatments or painful
surgical operations.
Miss Charlotte kwith, for the benefit
of The Oall readers, has Illustrated a set
of exercises which, if indulged in dally,
will put the sturdiest wrinkle to flight.
A New York woman . who has devoted a
lifetime to the study ami removal of
wrinkles, evolved this set of simple exer
cises, and they will serve either as an
ounce of wrinkle-prevention or a pound
of wrinkle-cure.
The latest theory by which she evolved
these exercises can best be explained in
her own words:
"The cause of wrinkles is the fact that
the outer layer of the skin is looser than
the inner layer. This is because, from
lack of proper exercise, the circulation of
the blood and other life giving fluids of
the body is retarded, and the inner skin
becomes attached to the bones of the
face. These must he loosened. It is not
necessary to take a scalping knife to do
this. Neither is it necessary to have a
surgeon take tucks in the scalp away up
in the hair somewhere and pull the skin
tighter un thi- face. This method is at
first successful, but the wrinkles come
back later, as the existing conditions are
not changed as to the relative conditions
of the two parts of the skin.
"Now. this inner layer may be loosened
from the bone by a very simple but strong
and heavy pressure of tlie finger tips,
with a rotary movement, without taking
them from the spot where they ...

thought that the inner tissue js being

that the wrinkles are not the only ugly
marks removed, but the effect upon the
whole disposition and character of the
woman is changed for th.- better. It is no(
the fault of lie faces that they are ugly;
it is because they are drawn so and held
as in a vise.
"There are ten movements, some of

relaxes one cheek as it stretches tho
other.
"Fill out hollow cheeks by compressing
the lips and puffing out the cheeks, hold
ing the breath in the mouth. Do this
often, as it exercises the largest muscles
of the face and fills out the whole out
line into a well-rounded contour. This is
better than wearing 'plumpers' or in
creasing the flabhiness of the outer skin
with a suction pump or by frequent
steaming.
"The lips should he contracted into a
circle and then moved in a circular man
ner, also stretching them backward at the
corners, showing the teeth. This will re
duce lips -which are too large and coarse
and give them a prettier curve In conse

"It will be noticed by a little observa
tion that a fat face is stolid and expres
sionless, while a muscular one is expres
sive and intelligent looking. This is the
end to be aimed for in all exercises.
"There are four movements for reduc
ing double chins which are absolutely cer
tain in their results. One ls to stretch the
chin upward and forward and the next
downward and forward, these two in al
ternation, since they are In direct oppo
sition. The other two movements are a
to-side movement while the chin is
elevated as high as possible. This
stretches out the sides of the chin. All
these exercises will reduce the fat and
make it into muscle which is firm and
small.
"All of these self-stretching muscle ex
ercises must he practiced daily, night and
morning, repeating about twenty-five
times each. The high, close collars and
band. must be removed, the neck being
left perfectly free from confinement of
any kind, so that it can be stretched to
the fullest extent without straining in any
way."
It has been asked whether these
stretching exercises will not make the
outer skin of the face all the more flabby,
but the woman declares that to be impos
sible. The flexibility of the Inner tissue
is the measure of the possible stretching
qualities of the outer cuticle, and as this
inner tissue is tighter it will not yield to
the full , stent of the outer skin; so that,
while apparently the outer skin is being
stretched, in fact it is not, but only the
inner tissue and muscles.
These exercises ring the deathknell of
any wrinkle. When a wrinkle gets a nico
comfy position on the face it takes
strong coaxing to make it disappear. It
would be foolish to think that a real old
fashioned come-to-stay wrinkle will de
part unless it is gently but firmly remind
ed that it is useless for it to try to stay.
Once a wrinkle begins to lose giound
its finish is easy. It takes a long time
to have any effect on wrinkles, but as
soon as their hold is loosened they suc
cumb qui;.' easily.
"An infinite capacity for taking pains"
fits as aptly to wrinkle-removers as to
genius. For you must work at them
night and morning. A little exercise now
and then will have not the slightest ef
fect. It is persistent and constant work
that accomplishes the desired effect.
I know a girl who lost a batch of dis
figuring wrinkles in two months. She de
voted an hour a day to the task. She

She has not entirely sworn off on the
exercises even now, when her face is per
fectly smooth. If the skin Is prone to
these little ditches they are likely to re
turn unless precautions ire taken. Ten
minutes a day. once they are removed, is
enough to scare away a wrinkle bent
upon returning.
There isn't any need of weeping < r

encourage their growth. If you really

directions. The wrinkle hasn't been

The woman of 30 and upward is coming
to her own.
Not a long while ago it was the fash
ion for novelists to make heroines of
misses whose years rarely numbered 20,
and often stopped at 16. Ti- seemed
something attractive In the beauty anil
innocence of youth. Either the supply
ran out or people began to get tired of
bread-and-buttrr fiction maidens, for
gradually the age of heroines has moved
up, and to-day they are frequently almost
middle aged.
This is fitting. Because she has out
lived the twenties a woman has not out
lived life. She is capable of moving the
world more effectually as a matron than
as; a maid. Most of the well-known wo
men of history were over 30 when they
distinguished themselves. Â,,
Says Balzac: "A woman at middle age
retains nothing of the pettiness of
youth She is a friend who gives you all
(he feminine delicacies, who displays all
the gracts. all the possessions which na
ture has given to woman to please man:
but who no longer sells these qualities.
She ls hateful or lovable, according* to
her pretensions of youth, whether they
exist under the epidermis or whether they
are ad."
