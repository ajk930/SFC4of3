ALLEGED DEFEAT OF BOERS,
ARRIVAL OF RELIEF COLUMN
Many Conflicting Reports Come
From Ladysmith, but the In
dications Are That a Decisive
Battle Will Soon Be Fought.
LONDON, Nov. 20.âA spe
cial dispatch from Estcourt dated
November 20 says a report has
reached there of a battle at Lady
smith, Wednesday. November
15, lasting from daybreak until 2
o'clock in the afternoon. Many
Boers are said to have been killed
and many are reported to have
been taken prisoners. The P.rit
ish losses are reported to be much
less. Another battle is said to
have occurred Thursday. It is
described as the heaviest yet
fought. The Boer dead, it is
added, number hundreds, while
the British losses were compara
tively small.
The Standard publishes the fol
lowing from Ladysmith! dated
Sunday. November 19: The ar
rival of the relief column at Est
court has completely modified
the plans of the enemy, and Gen
eral Joubert has moved to the
south in an effort to prevent the
junction of the two British forces.
ESTCOURT, Monday, Nov.
20. â To-day fresh news is 3gain
at hand from Ladysmith in the
shape of a long official message
from General White and also
fome private dispatches. It ap
pears that on Wednesday nnd
Thursday of last week a big fight
took place, the Boers attacking
the town in force. All the Eng
lish infantry was engaged. The
Boers were repulsed and a por
tion of their trenches were car
ried. Their loss was great in
killed and wounded and prison
ers, but the British casualties
amounted to only about one
tenth of theirs.
Ladysmith is full of wounded
and captured Boers. It is report
ed that in the fighting on Novem
ber 9 the enemy lost 300 killed
and 50b captured.
Major General Methuen's pa
trols have located the enemy on
the northeast about ten miles off.
The Boers would not be drawn
out. Fighting is reported at the
Mooi River.
Runners declare that General
Joubert is coming on against Est
court to-day with large reinforce
ments, with the intention of at
tacking the place.
â¢ BERLIN, Nov. 20.â Co
logne Gazette publishes the fol
lowing dispatch from Cape
Town: "Everything ii prepared
for a general rising of the natives
throughout Cape Colony. They
are ready at any moment to make
common cause with the Boers."
BOER ACTIVITY ABOUT LADYSMITH.

The San Francisco Call
LONDON. Nov. n. la. m.â The re
ports of heavy fighting at Lady- |
Bmlth last Wednesday have not
be-Â»n â firmed On the contrary,
the reliable advices from â  court
indicate rhat then* was nothing more than
a desultory cannonade. Probably th*Â» ru
mor of a serious engagement grew out of I
the fact that the Boers threw a fewharm- j
less shells late Tuesday night, leading to I
the supposition that an attack waa immi
nent. thine happened, however, on.
Wednesday.
Bvyond the fact that the Boers are dally
receiving fre^h reinforcements and sup
plies there is practically nothing new
from the front.
The. Boor Invasion of Cape Colony con
tinues steadily and rapidly. There are
1300 Boors at Ci>lesburg and news has

near Allwal North, has been deserted by I
the British ar.d Is now in the hands of
the enemy.
A Pretoria dispatch announces the ar
rival there, among the British prisoners, :
of Major Haldane. Lieutenant Brochle
and Lieutenant Hallway. It also declares
That the British on Sunday made two un-
Fuccessful attempts to oust the Rust en
burg commando from a position near Ma
ft-klng and that severe fighting took plac*-, \
From Delagoa Bay come reports of the
arrival of more German officer. 1 * and artil
lerymen who have volunteered to perve
with the Transvaal forces.
The War Office ::ii-offlciaJly asserts
that all news received from Africa has
been published with the exception of de- I
mands for the renewal of stores, war j
material and the like. Thai is an un
confirmed rumor that more troops have
been ordered from India to the Cape.
The plan of operation on both sides Is
slowy unfolding itself. General Joubert j
is evidently moving south to prevent, if |
possible, the Junction of the British re
lieving force with the forces at Estcourt
and Ladyfmlth. while on the Orange
River border the Boers are believed to De
concentrating at Donkerpoort to oppose
GeneraJ Buller's advance. It is said t>.*)
Boers have already laagered at Donkcr
poort.
The English plan s*-ems to be a three- i
fold advanceâ from Durban to Ladysmith.
from Orange River to Kimberley and
from East London, by way of Queens
town, to Burghersdorp. General BulJer
ha.Â« wired the commanding officer at
Queenstown announcing th*Â» dispatch of
GeneraJ Gatacre with thÂ»Â» first battalion
of the Seventh Brigade to East Ixindon.
This was the plarp It was originally in- j
tended that Galacre's column shoulu '.Mart
for. Thus it Is possible that General Bul
ler's rat plans have suffered less modi
fication than Mine have supposed.
General Gatacre will be able to keep the ;
Boers on the Orange border sufficiently
occupied to preserve General Methuen I
from undue molestation, especially if
rumors from various sources that de- I
scribe the Free Stat* burghers as In r.o .
wise enthusiastic for lighting are well
founded.
It has been reported that General BullÂ«Â»r i
will take up his quarters at De Aar. but
this seems doubtful. De Aar. where a '
vast amount of stores have been collected.
Is the base for General Methuen'a ad
vance, and General Her may have h*en
there for a clay or so. It Is believed, how
ever, that he still has his headquarters at
Cape Town.
Although Kimberley la supposed to be
the objective point of General Methuen.
many military critics are of the opinion :
that hi.Â« advance will be not toward Kir- i
berley. but across the Orange Free State.
In order to secure complete command of
the Orange River.
The debarkation of troops at Cape Town '
is proceeding in the most satisfactory
manner. One thousand eight hundred
and fifty railway carriages have been col
lected there for the conveyance of troops
northward, and there is talk of suspend
ing the suburban traffic so as to acceler
ate military work.

GENERAL CLERY'S
TASK IS DIFFICULT
LONDON, Nov. 20.â The present week.
according to the dispatches from the
front, ought to see a change in the de
fensive tactics hitherto maintained by the
British In South Africa. It is said that
the tack allotted to General defy, that
of relieving Ladyamitha will tax his gen
eralship to the utmost. The Boers are
developing .1 great deal of strength In
the neighborhood of Estcourt and Gen
eral Joubert is reported to be moving
southward him?- if In order to direct the
movement to repel the British advance,
after. It would s<âm. attempting to Isolate
Estcourt. This latter movement is al
ready in progress. The Boers practically
surround the town.
General Clery is lamentably deficient in
cavalry and artillery, though attempts
are being made to re-place the former by
an Outlander mounted Infantry, of which
about lS'X* have started for the front.
The popular anticipations here regard
ing the relief of Kimberley appear too
sanguine. The British force la not yet
ready and when it starts it will have a
dangerous r<>aii t<> follow, every foot of
which will probably be contested if the
British attempt a direct advance. So, Â«t
Is said, possibly instead of rushing di
rectly for Kimborley the British win ad
vance across the frontier In the direction
of Blocmfonteln. which may* thus be
threatened. This, It is claimed, would
draw off General Oonje's forces and en
able the railroad to be restored.
From the presence of General Buller
n*ar General Methuen at Orange River it
Js anticipated that the main advances
will bo made on 'â â¢â¢â¢ west side, but it is
added unless General Gatacre is able to
advance simultaneously and push hack
the Boors who are occupying so many
points south of the Orange River, the
British lines of communication will be
seriously threatened. (â

BOER PRISONERS ARE
SOMEWHAT DISCOURAGED
LONDON. Nov. 2L-The following dis
: patch from its special correspondent hi
published by the Daily Telegraph-
CAPE TOWN. Nov. U._ A batch of
I elghty-eeven Boer prisoners who were
: captured at Elands Laagte arrived to-day
by the steamer Putiala. Many of the men
were wounded. The most serious cases,
numbering a dozen, were landed and dis
patched to the camp hospital at Wynberg.
â â  The others were taken to Simons Town to
' join their comrades, who are detained on
; board the Penelope. I conversed with
some of the wounded. Including Com
mandant Pretorius. who was shot through
both legs, and three members of the
Johannesburg detective force, who were
enrolled in his commando. With trifling
exceptions the Boers had no conception
â¢of the business they undertook. In their
j own words. "We expected to meet boys
| but we were vanquished by men."
The majority of the Free State Boers
indeed, looked upon tho affair as a pleas
ant picnic through Natal, with peace
termg to be dictated by General Joubert
from Pietermaritzburg. with British
withdrawal and an immense strengthen
ing of the Dutch republican position in
the country. All prisoners to whom I
spoke extolled the bravery of the British
forces at Elands Laagte.
UNSUCCESSFUL NIGHT
ATTACK OF THE BOERS
LONDON, Nov. 21â The Dally Tele

special correspondent:
ESTI'OI-RT. Nov. W -Some parties of
Boers appeared this afternoon and even-
Ing at Willow Grande Highlands, near
Moil Rtrer. Bodlei of our mounted vol

POLICY OF THE POPE.
BERLIN. Nov. 2aâ A correspondent of
the Tageblntt In Rumo learns on good
authority in Vatican circles that an in
fluential pn.up tried to influence th<*
Pope agaiu.xt British POtfcy In South
Africa. The Pope, however, declined to
follow their counsels because England
has never given the church any ground
for c-omplalnt and because an anti-
British policy would cherk the movement
in England in favor of good relations
with the Vatican.
ALLEGED STARVATION.
PIETERMARITZBTRO. Nov. 20.-A
party of British heliographers, cut off by
the Boers outside of Estcourt. connived
to escape to New Hanover, on the Grey
town line, and arrived here to-day. They
report that 6ftoo Boers, driven by starva
tion, are forajrlnÃ toward Greytown. No
alarm is felt, but it may require a divi
sion of the relieving; column to annihilate
them.

FUNSTON WILL BACK HIS
HONOR WITH HIS COIN
He Challenges Any One to Prove He Looted
Churches While Fighting in the Philippines.
Denounces the Charges Made Against Him and Scorches Those
Who Will Not Take Up His Defiance Thomas Fox Enters
the Controversy With a Communication.
f" - r"\ HERE was one piece of work
i which General Funston had ar-
THERE to attend to after work
which General Funston had ar
rar.Ked '<â <> attend to after he ar-
I rived here from Kansas this last
time and before he left again for
Manila. He was going to hunt up one
John J. Sullivan, a man set forth by a
publication known as Donahoe's Maga
zine as a "reputable Journalist." who con
tributed for the November number of
that periodical an article charging Fun
ston with looting Catholic churches in
the Philippines.
On his arrival here Sunday evening
Funs*. first recourse was the direct
ory, but he found eleven John J Sulll
vans. none of them even reporters. So
he has put himself on record generally
in regard to the matter and has answered
the charges made against him. and then
he winds up with a challonÃe for any one
to prove, to the profit of the State Red
Cross Society and the satisfaction of
three Jewish residents of San Francisco,
either that he ever looted â  church or
knowingly allowed a church to be looted;
or that M: I Fun.non ever received from
him or any one else any plunder taken
from a church.
The charges against Funston are not
new. but heretofore the general has let
them pass, referring to them only in the
briefest terms and at long intervals; but
he always hoped to be able to find the
John J. Sullivan he was looking for. and
bo he made no definite statement on the
subject. He dexrided. however, to set
his side before the public before he left
for Manila, and to that end, falling to
find the proper Sullivan, he ha." ad
dressed the following letter to The Call:
To the Editor of the San Francisco Call-
A Catholic Church publication known an Dona
hoe's Magazine, published In Boston, has in its
November number an article by one John J.
Sullivan, whom the editor vouches for as a
"reliable Journalist" of San Francisco. In
which this gentleman with the rich Corkonlan
name gives a formidable array of alleged data
regarding the looting of churches In the Philip
pines. In my nervous anxiety to learn the
Identity of this John J. Sullivan. I. on my ar
rival In San Francisco yesterday, buried myself
in that widely exciting publication, the Ctty
Directory of San Francisco, and there, to my
anguish. TounJ that there are eleven John J.
Sullivan* In San Francisco, the most of them
bartenders. coalpaÂ«Â»**rÂ« and *lf>at r boys, but
nothing to Indicate which of them was the
"reliable Journalist."
Are we to be driven to the conclusion that
this Is the young roan who conducts the ele
vator In Its mad flight from the ground floor
to the office of the Monitor? Perish thÂ»
thought! The mental wabbllngs. of the hyster
ical youth who has thus plunged suddenly Into
fame are mostly pitiable and laughable, and
only assume a serious phase when we recollect
that any blackguard when making Wild asser
tions in a plausible manner and giving an array
1 of dates and alleged Incidents can have himself
rated far above his true worth.
Ordinarily I would not think It worth my
while to notice such a tissue of lies as this
young puppy has regaled us with, but the fact
that I have friends in all parts of the United
States who are Roman Catholics, and the fact
that I have the greatest respect for the opinions
of the bulk of the clergy and laity of that body.
Impels me to Â»how to the public the actual
I facts regarding the allegations by the above
j mentioned youth. He says:
General Funston has in his possession a
blue silk gold-ornamented robe taken from
the statue of the Blessed Virgin In the Ca
loocan church on February 11. In stripping
this robe from the statue the figure was
mutilated and almost hacked to pieces. The
glass case In which It was encased was
broken into a thousand pirce^.
Although there is a doubt as to whether
Funston himself stole this robe from the
statue. Mrs. Stevens, a hospital nurse from
Colorado, and Thomas Fox. a voluntary
nurse in the Hospital corps, who is now
employed In the Hall of Records In the clty
of Oakland. Cal.. claim that they were eye
witnesses to the theft and that Funeton Is
guilty. Mrs. Stevens, who has a son in the
army, was ambitious tj get possession of
the robe. Its beauty having been described
to her by her HO. She went to the church
for the purpose of obtaining It. but on the
way she was told that Funs: had heard
about the robe and at that time was en
gaged In divesting the statue of it. On en
tering the church this report was confirmed.
At the time the sacred robe was stolen Mr.
Peters, a sketch artist for either Harpers
or Leslie * Monthly, was engaged In sketch-
Ing the police station in Gala an. and It Is
claimed by Fox that the artist was an eye
witness to the theft. The robe was subse
quently presented to the wife of General
Funston by the latter, who considered It a
most extraordinary and valuable gift. Fox
served in the ambulance corps under Cap
tain Black of the North Dakota regiment.
This Is all very interesting, but. unfortu
i nately, a lie. When the Twentieth Kansas oc
cupied the Caloocan church on the night of
February 10 1 at once ordered Lieutenant S i
G. Hopkins, officer of the guard, to remove all
of the altar furniture and such of the Images
as were portable to a side room and place a
guard over them until a leek could be pro
cured for the door. I personally saw that this
was done. The sergeant of the guard was J.
C Murphy, a Roman Catholic. Present ad
dress of both Hopkins and Murphy. Leaven
worth, Kan-. In another room was a chest of
drawers containing ' priest robes, etc. The
guard, which was changed every day, had In
structions from me to see that nothing in
this room was disturbed by anybody.
About February 16, not on the nth. as the
"reliable Journalist" says, the sergeant of the
guard. Lewis, of Company E. Twentieth Kan
sas, came to me and said that an American
woman Â»aÂ» dragging the robes out on to the
floor and that she paid no attention to his ad
monitions to stop. I went with him and found
a middle-aged woman of short stature and
Iron-gray hair Indiscriminately packing away
a number of robes. I told her that unless she
desisted at once I would put her under arrest.
She turned on me like a tigress, and said:
"There Is not anything In this trash that I
want. If I did It would take a bigger man
than you to stop me from taking It."
1 ordered her from the building, and she left.
vowing to get even. I never learned this wom
{ an* name, hut saw her several times after
ward. Her refutation was that of a meddle
some nd disreputable camp follower. She Is
probably the Mrs. Stevens spoken of by the
"reliable Journalist."
Thomas Fox, spoken of above, was never in
the huepltal corps of In any way connected with
the army, but was a dissolute and worthless
fellow used an a lackey by McCutcheon and
Bass, two correspondents in the Philippines,
to care for their carrier pigeons and do their
camp work for them. Three times he was
fined In the provost court of Manila for drunk
enness and disorderly conduct. I myself put
him under arrest for looting a private house in
GENERAL FRED FUNSTON.
MaWon. He gtnwed himself away on th* Tar
' tar to return to San Francisco, refusal to do
his share of work when discovered, and was
put on bread and water for two weeks by
Colonel Metcalf. He arplled to me for relief,
and I told him he could stay on bread and
water nil his life before I would Interfere. He
promptly registered a vow to "do" me. It
would doubtless be a delichtful surprise to the
people of Oakland to know that this fellow
Is now employed In their Hall of Records. Re
garding Captain Abernethy. I quote:
tenant Abernethy. formerly of the
Third Artillery, bat now captain of a com
pany <â¢( the Thirtieth Volunteer Regiment,
entered the church nt PaoiÃ In the latter
part of last February and broke open the
Klass case th.it contained the ctatue of St.
Augustine. Finding nothing of unusual
value he left the church In charge of a
guard. Later he returned, hoping to flnd
something of value OH thÂ» statue. The black
robe, of little value. In which the figure
was dressed was torn Into shreds. The gilt
beading, which the captain hoped was gr;ld.
was taken, after which the statue was
broken Into many pieces.
Captain Abernethy. who belongs to the
Thirty-sixth instead of tr> the Thirtieth, was a
lieutenant In the Third Artillery, which was
brigaded with the Twentieth Kansas on the
n^rth line at Caloocan. fifteen miles , fr^m
Paslg. I know that Lieutenant Abernethy was
on constant duty with his regiment, and It Is
utterly Impossible for him to have been at
Pasig In February or at any other time during
the war. So much for He No. 2.
Now for another.
I quote again from the "reliable Journalist":
The members of the Twentieth Infantry
entered a church at Maloloa on March 5 or 8
and treated the statues erected to variou*
saint* In a manner similar to that pur
sued by Abernethy In the church at fal
oocan. A statue encased In glass In a recess
of the wall wan removed and broken Into
pices by the soldiers, the Ivory hand* and
head being taken. The empty casket was
utilized as a bed by one of the soldier*.
The Twentieth Infantry was never in Malo
los nor within thirty miles of that place.
How could any American troop* have been
there on March 5 or 6 when Malolos was not
captured until the 31*t day of that month? So
far, so food. Now for He No. 4.
Second lieutenant Lapp. Company C.
First South Dakota Regiment, has a sur
plice taken from the church at San Pedro
Macatl. It was taken frcm the sacristy ad
joining the sanctuary. A number of other
vestments were also taken, but were lost
or mislaid on the voyage from Manila to
the United States. Lapp claimed that he
would not sell the article at any price, as
he considered It a valuable relic of, the
Philippine campaign.
The South Dakota Regiment was In Mac A
rthur's division, many miles from San Pedro
Macati. and never during the whole war was
within twenty miles of that place.
I bass over a number of wild statements re
garding private soldiers of various organisa
tions, as I, for obvious reasons, have not at
hand the facts necessary to refute all of the
"reliable journalist's" statements. One of
them, however, as It deals with my old regi
ment. I can attend to.
Private Andrew Dalton. Twentieth Kan
sas Regiment, has In his possession a mani
ple taken from a church In San Pedro
Macati. It Is of gorgeous pattern and magni
ficently ornamented In gold and silver. lv
value Is Intestlmable. "I can thank a
Filipino for this vestment." he said. In tell
ing how he procured It. "The regiment was
encamped in the church for several days
and during that time nearly everything of
value was taken by the boys. Although I
was with them. I was unable to secure any
thing save a piece of the altar. One day I
noticed a native crouching In one corner of
the vestibule leading, to the church. Al
though he was detailed to clean the church.
I noticed that he was unusually quiet ap
parently hiding from the boys. i accosted
him and ordered him to leave the place and
get to work. No sooner had he left than I
began to Investigate thÂ« cause of his hiding.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
After scattering a heap of rubbish from thÂ»
corner of the vestibule I found hidden un
derneath, carefully covered with old news
papers, the vestments you now see. I took
them to the basement of the church, where
I hid them until we left our quarter*."
There never was an officer or man by thÂ«
name of Dalton In the Twentieth Kansas who
went to the Philippines, and neither the Kansas
Reziment nor any detachment of it was ever
In Han Pedro Macatl. Now, further. I have put
a check of rioflO on the Bank of California In
the hand* of my aid. Lieutenant B. J. Mitchell,
Fortieth t'nlted State* Volunteer Infantry, now

FOX DENIES CHARGES.
Answers a Statement Made by
Funston in Kansas City.
Referring to a dispatch from Kan
City, published her* and sent the day
Funston left there for this coast. Thomas
Fox takes occasion to deny some of th*
statements made about him by Funston.
In speaking of the charges of looting,
Funston made the following statements:
I have found out who the author of the libel
Is: It was a man by the nan of Fox, a ramp
follower. He deserted from an English sail In*
ship and followed us during the campaign. Ifa
was flne-1 three times In the provost court for
drunkenness and disorderly conduct. At Ma
ralo I found him in a private housÂ« and or
dered him under arrest, as he had no business
there. The paper that printed his story said It
was from a reliable newspaper man. Ills con
nection with the press was the valet to carrt-r
pigeons used by McCutcheon and Bass, two cor
respondents of the Philippines. Fox stowed
himself away on board the Tartar when w# left
Manila, and when he was discovered refused to
work. Colonel Metcalf placed him on bread and
water for two weeks, and he swore vengeance
against us both. He has made no attack oa
Colonel Metcalf, but m.iJ- this one on me.
These statements Fox takes up in tba
following letter:
Editor Call: Funston nays he has found out
that I was a camp follower. He is correct. 1
was a camp follower. If he wishes, and. to
quote from a .â¢'..â¢ testimony from Major
Bell, "the only camp follower who was wel
come everywhere or who followed our fortunes
with the knowledge aa I consent of the com
manding general."
"Fox deserted from an English sailing ship
and followed us during the campaign "
I not only never deserted from an English
sailing ship, but never even set foot on on* In
my life! I did. Indeed, follow the army darts*
the campaign and witnessed the spoliation of
Caloocan Church Incidentally. There is an In
sinuation in this statement that I deserted at
Manila to try the fortunes of war. I can fur
nish plenty of proof that I departed from San
Francisco on the transport Pennsylvania and
was compelled to stay in Honolulu five weeka
as the result of Injuries I then re-en:'
on the transport Warren for the Philippine*.

KANSAS CITY. Mo.. Nov. 20.â A dispatch To the Times from Cleveland.
Ohio, kij;:: When General MetcaJf was seen at Elyrla. twenty-five miles
from Cleveland. uMo. to-night. whÂ«ie he is visiting, he said:
'â¢1 understand that the a!!ldavlt presented by Hall was merely slf?md "-.
Soldier.' That kind of an afUdavlt Is not given any attention. The matter
with Hall is that he did not ret a promotion. There is nothing in the
charge at ail.
" The whole Rtory was investigated last ring by the Manila army au
thoritien and by Dean C. Worcester, a member of the Philippine Commission.
At that time the charges wore found to be utterly groundless. Th'.s Is -.he
Drst Um<* that my uamu has been connected with the story. The story nrft
originated in a letter a soldier boy wioto homo and some little Incident was
greatly exaggerated by this soldier boy. l can't account for Halls action
unleha he feels resentment against me because he was not recommended for
pruin-ition *nd expects to Injure rr.e by It."
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â The officials of the War Department, are sur
prised to li.'ar of tho chare* s m.i.l. agatnst Colonel Metcalf, for whom a very
hiÃh opinion is entertained In army elides.
Secretary Ko*Â»t expressed the belief that the charges were not true, but
eu\& he had no Information regarding the matter, of which he had not hoard
anything until given the press report. In view of the high rank of the officer
and of the explicit acdount regarding the alleged crime contained In the affi
davits accompanying the charges, It Is expected that the oitleials will take
formal sction with a view to ascertaining the accuracy of the published
statements.
General Funston In in Interview last ntpht spoke lichtly of the charges.
"I do not care to hay much on this matter." be said. "I believe the
charge* are the work of some members of the Twentieth Kansas whom Col
onel MÂ«*tcalf and 1 have had reason recently to severely discipline. Colonel
Metcalf has left Kansas and 1 altw departed two days ago.
"I will say, Jiowe\ or, that the charge agiinst Colonel Metcalf was abso
lutely disproved after an exhaustive Investigation at Manila last spring, con
ducted by Major Mai lory under orders by General Otis. Major Mallory
ivportod that there was nothing in the charge. The matter is now in the
hands Â«>f the War liepartmeiiU
"As for myself. 1 may say that I have never courted any notoriety
through the press. My communications during the war were with such men
as McCutcheon, Bass and others on the firing line, who reported things m they
taw them. My promotion was not due to their r*| scn,tatl.Â»ns. but was

The Governor of Neuva Vlsaya has

theÂ«Â« days, that the administration of his
province cannot change .too quickly, and
is coming M Manila to tell Major General
Otis of his loyalty and incidentally to re
quest that be be retained in office under
the new regime.
Admiral Watson has received an ad
ditional credible report that Lieutenant
J. C. Glim and live of the captured
sailors of the United States gunboat
Vorktown were at Tarlac November 10.
Lieutenant Gilmoie was living In a Fili
pino general's house.
The cruiser Baltimore started for Lln

overdue, has not arrived at Llnguayen.
Bailors of the gunboat Castine occupy
Zamboanga, on the southwest extremity
of the Island of Mindanao. The business
men. chiefly Chinese, requested Com
mander S. W. Very of the Castine to take
possession of the place and protect them
from the Insurgents. Commander Very
landed a naval force, and, although no
details have been received, it appears he
found thai he bad a large contract on
band, and telegraphed to Major General
Otis requesting the presence of troops.
Hut none were available except by with
drawing part of the fores from one of the
neighboring islands temporarily. The
original i lan was to have Brigadier Gen
oral Alfred i: Bates establish the ad
quarters of tÂ»ie governorship Of the Mo
hatnmedan islands there when the new
regiments arrived. It will be carried out
later, when General Bates returns from
his trip to the southern islands. He has
been visiting the garrisons of Jolo, Slassi
and Boiigao.
The friendliness of the Moros for the
Americans is increasing under General
Bates' diplomatic administration. The
threatened feuds of the Datos Jakal
nina und Calois against the Sultan will
probably be averted through the pacifies
influence of the American officers.
Mindanao villagers have seized a smug
gling schooner bound from lloilo to Zam
l.oansu and supposed to be run by dis
charged Idlers. They murdered all the
crew.
General Bates is now on board the

ods followed by the Britisli in the govern
ment of the Mohammedans.
STORY OF DESTRUCTION
OF A BANDIT VILLAGE
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â The War De
partment lus made public a report of
Captain A. A. liyrne. Sixth Infantry, j
giving an uccount of the attack and de- j
struction of a bar.dlt village in the La !
Carlotta District, island of Negros. last
July. The account is a very inter-
chapter of the American occupation of
the Philippines. This band of marauders
was entrenched in the fastnesses of the
mountains. They were well organized and
armed. All precautions bad oeÂ«.n mado
against attack. On ail sides which it was
supposed could be reached by truups the
camp was guarded by block houses. Cap
tain liyrne, with something over UK) men,
went out to destroy this bandit camp. He
was aware : .a 1 it was necessary' to sur
prise them, and this could only be accom
plished by approaching from the side
which seemed Impossible of ascent. This
march was difficult and the approach to
the camp was performed In the night. It
was reacned in the early morning and at
once attacked. The bandits largely out
numbered the Americans and were fight
ing from behind cover. For two hours
there was a very desperate engiigerrent
a.nd only the pluck and valor of the Amer
ican soldiers enabled them to secure the
victory. The number of bandits killed
largely exceeded the American force,
while there was no means of ascertaining
the number of wounded. Finally those
who could set away escaped; leaving all
tlnir property bind them. The village
was destroyed. a.s as the property that
could not l.c carried away. The men had
climbed a mountain side at night; they
fought without their breakfasts against
superl odds, and upon an almost un
known ground. In closing his report Cap
tain Byrne says:
"In looking for a reason for the appar
ent sure? 3B of this expedition too much
credit cannot be given to the officers and
men under my command, and every one
Of them acted as though he was person
ally responsible for the success of the
whole, affair."
Lieutenant Colonel Wynn, commanding
the Sixth Infantry, made the following In
dorsement of the report, which la con
curred in by Generals Smith. Hughes und
Otis:
"I consider It a remarkable perform
ance on his part and that of his command
in the way of endurance, perseverance
and cool courage under most frying cir
cumstances. For Captain Byrne 1 strongly
recommend, for distinguished gallantry
and rallying the men on the bridge, a
medal of honor; for Lieutenant NeÃbitt,
a brevet of captain for coolness and cour
age displayed; and for Sergeant William
J. Chuck and Sergeant J. W. Swan, cer
tificates of meritorious service."
This report contains a graphic descrip
tion of a perilous undertaking most suc
cessfully executed, entitling those par
ticipating to all the honors herein recom
mended.
In recognition of his service Captain
Byrne was made lieutenant colonel of the
Fortieth Regiment. U. 8. V. <

AWAITS DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON. N,.v 2<> -The Secretary
of War spent over two hour? with thÂ«-
President to-day discussing his annunl
report, on which repnrt will be ba*ed some
of the most Important sections of the
Prt-sUlenfs message to Congress. It l.Â«
understood that this section of tho message
will be held open aa long as p<Â»sfÂ«lble,
awaiting developments in the Philippine*
which may change the status of the Mtua
tt":i ulmoHt any day. The other sections
of tho message are nearly completed, but
to finish the message before Congress
nif-f-ts will call for a larpe amount of hard
work. Owing to this fact it la probable
that the President will not be able to go
to Nashville to participate In the welcome
home of the TfinnriSÃrfl Regiment. No
definite determination has been made,
however. If the trip Is undertaken it will
be made In the briefest practicable time.
There were a number of callers at the
White Bouse. Senator Platt joined the
President during the latter f morning
walk and called at tlio "White House with

STARTS FOR MANILA
NEW YORK. Nov. MLâ With Hags flying
and soldiers cheering, and with the band
of the Forty-first Infantry on her deck
playing "The Girl I Left Behind Me." the
United States transport Logan steamed
i 1 iwn the bny to-day and out to see on
her way to the Philippines. The Govern
ment gave it* aid to the godspeed by
sending orders that tugs follow the trans
port down tho bay and care for the peo
ple who had come to see the soldiers off.
From the time the Logan left her anrh
orago In the upper bay at 3:15 p. m. until
she passed out of Sandy Hook and was
well on her way she was accompanied by
a flotilla of tugs. Some were Government
tugs and some had been privately char
tered, but all of them were loaded with
mothers, fathers, relatives and friends of
the departing soldiers. They cheered and
waved all the way down the bay, while
the strains of "Auld Lang Syne" and
"The Star Spangled-Hanner" came In an
swer from the regimental band of the
transport. Some of the soldiers' friends
were still on board when the vessel had
weighed anchor and started, but they
were taken 4ff by the tups before the
transport passed out of the Hook.

AMERICAN TROOPS
DRIVEN BACK TO IMUS
MAN I LA. Nov. 20.â There has been n
revival of Insurgent activity south of
.Manila, particularly In Cavito Province.
At In. a] the Flliplnoa fired a
smoothbore cannon, but this was suun
silenced by the American artillery.
In the oourse of the mornjng Major
Cowlee. with a battalion of the Fourth
Infantry and two guns scattered the
enemy from the districts around Imus
and in the direction of Peres das
Marinas. The Americans could not pur
sue the retreating insurgents because
their ammunition was exhausted. The
Filipinos were under the command 6f
General Mariano Trias.
Two columns, one from Imus and the
other from Bacoor, converged on ths
Zapote bridge, where they found a de
serted Filipino camp.
Two troops of the Fourth Cavalry, four
companies of the Fourth Infantry and
two guns of Captain Riley's battery pro
ceeded to Annaboo, south of Imus, and
came upon the enemy entrenched at that
point. Th'Â»y scattered the Filipinos, but
as the latt-r were subsequently reln
fofosd the Americans returned to Imus
under fire, seven of our men beln?

insurgents at Annaboo.

TON HOTKL. WASHINGTON. Nov. 20.-
N'ws that the transfer of the gift house
has br>en made has excited a degree of
Indignant fÂ«tlir.g against Admiral Dewey
too utrong to pass unnoticed. When tne
report was jirst published that the Ad
miral intended to transfer to his bride the
residence pr.-sented to him or.ly a few
W<fks before there wete murmurs of d;s
eÂ«r.t here, and considerable feelim; whs
manifested by persons who had contrib
uted to the fund.
Within the past few days letters have
been received by members of the Dewey
hoiuo. fund commute frÂ»m contributors
to the fund demanding the return <if con
tributions If the tranpfer took place. Many
X->ersons refused to believe the report,
maintaining the admiral could not. with
decency, give away a house presented to
him by the per pie of the United StaUa.
Fcveral reasons for the Intention credited
i" the admiral and now confirmed were
iidvar.eed and Kcr.erally uiscus>sed In
Washington, hut few p. rsr>ns could ur.
<Wptai:d why the trsr.Rfer should be made
to Mrs. Dewey. who has a considerable
fortune c.f her own and an income larger
than the admiral's salary.

National Committeemen Admit Pres

CHICAGO. Nov. 20â The Democratic

to-morrow, and. It is expected, will not
get throuyh with the business M hand
before night.
Nothing was said about a meeting of
the national committee, but It Is the
opinion of most of the national commit

ThÂ« committeemen were very uncom
municative as to what was done at the
meeting. Secretary Charles A. Walsh said
the committee had transacted no busi
ness of interest or importance and h.id
only considered administrative affairs.
After the meeting had adjourned, how
ever, some of the ct>mmltteemen con
tinued the discussion of the probable
Fttuattrm npxt TPar. Tbey disclosed the
fact thai a considerable part ot Urn foni
mittee's sitting hail been devoted to dis
cussing thÂ«- probabl" effect of high ,

several members of the comml
â  nion that if present prices of man

Democrats will "have â  hard row to

This idea has assumed such tangible

Athletic Clubâ San Franciscos
Hatch Clever Boxers.
Indication! point to a large crowd at the
initial boxing exhibition to be (riven by
the Columbian Athletic Club in its rooms
fct 2s Gulden Gate avenue this evening.
A large r.urnber of heat* have bÂ«-en dis
\f^<tA of and there is every proFpect of a
crowded house. The managers of the club
propose to make the opening exhibition
one we nh the price of admission, as it is
in the field to utay. No d-!ays will mar
thÂ»s rport and faking on the pan of con
testants in the eight bouu scheduled will
Dot \ft toieriued. Referee McGlnley stated
yesterday that he would throw the first
lad who faked out of the ring and would
alao deprive him of any remuneration he
might re-cejve for appearing before the
assembled boxing enthusiast*.
Eddie Toy and Charley Vlcker?, two
clever and hard-hitting amateurs, will
furnish the event of the night. Both lads
have trained hard for the bout and a faÂ«t
fight Is assured The other bouts will he
between Charles Thur?ton and Charles
Post *t 147 pounds; William Toy and Joe
Lf.ng at ISO pounds; "Kid" Johnson and
Charles Collins at 130 pound*; "Kid"
Dob.fon, alias "The Alligator," and Boh
Armstrong, the "Black Cyclone." Joe
Kennedy naa consented to , -.r a three
round bout with Pete Long. This will be
the former's first appearance in this city
tlncf- hi* Eastern trip.
The Ean Francisco Athletic Club has ar-
I ranged an interesting card for Tuesday
evening. November ft. Manager Greg
j gfclr.a ha/ matched six clever amateurs to
j Ight before the club, four of whom are
known to the followers of the pastime but
re strsnjrern to the local club. Jack
McCormick of Portland will do battle with
l^ewis Richards at Via pounds; Tom Her-
I man fit Denver will box "Kid" Johnson nt
UKpo-.:.i^ and Charles Fredericks and El
j Nolan, both of the club, will meet at IS|
pounds. The latter events will be eight
rounds In duration.
The main bout will be between George
Baker of Salt I^ke and William Martin of
L<is Angles for ten rounds at US pounds.
The battle will virtually decide thÂ«
fcather-welirht chnmplon?hfp of the coast,
as Baker haa downed the Wadintc men of
his class. Martin comes from the citrus
belt well recommended and will try to
regain the laurels wrested from De Cour
cey by Baker In Los Angele* the latter
I part of Ust month.
It Â» â 
To Test a Game Law.
ThÂ» constitutionality of the recent ordi
nance parsed by Stanislaus County, which
prohibits the shipping of wild game out of
the county, is poon to b* tested In the Su
preme Court. A short lime ago a market
hunter named James Knapp attempted to
forward to thin city a quantity of wild
durkh he had killed, and was arrested and
fined t2O by a Justice of the Peace. Upon
the advice of his lawyer he refused to pay
the fine and went to prison. An attempt
Â«tR made to xtK'ure his release on a writ
of habcnn corpus In the Superior Court of
that ccunty. but to no purpoVe, and yes
terday an application was made to the Su
preme Court, where a writ wan Issued
made returnable on Thursday. The claim
! Is madÂ» that the ordinance is in violation
, of the State constitution.

TRICES OF BABY
INMAN FOUND
The Child Was Probably
Eaten by Coyotes.
Fpeelal Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
SPOKANE. Nov. 20.â Traces of baby
Ruth lonian, the two-year-old girl who
disappeared so mysteriously from th.-
Watson farm near Harrington, October
22, were, found to-day by George Lynch,
a cattleman. Only some portions of the
clothing and a piece of scalp with hair
on it and portions of three fingers were
found, but they are sufficient to identify
the child, which was undoubtedly eaten
by coyotes.
The disappearance was one of the
strangest on record. The child had been
playing with other children at the Wat
| son farm ami her absence was noticed
less than half an hour after being seen
with the other children. For two weeks
a diligent search was instituted, over 200
j men Joining In an organized party, while
several small parties were also formed.
Merchants left their stores and farmers
their fields to join in the search. Every
foot of ground lor milÂ« near the farm
! was thoroughly searched and it Is Incon
ceivable how the articles found to-day
could have been missed. So thorough
was the search that old monkey wrenches,
lost whips and many farm tools were
unearthed.
The long search was finally abandoned,
the theory of abduction paining credence.
All Lincoln County was deeply worked
up over the affair, which has created a
sensation throughout Eastern Washing
ton. The child parents live at Creston
and they had gone to the farm of William
Watson, near Harrington, for a visit on
the fatal Sunday, taking baby Ruth with
them.

The LEASE OF GRAZING LANDo.
THE results of the water storage convention in
this city have fairly combined the two ques
tions of leasing the grazing land of the public
domain and storage of flood waters.
â 
â 
com
â 
;-.t Us
â 
â¢itrol.
The way to avoid it, indeed, the way to avoid the
prospect that ii may be done and in that prospect de
feat the .leasing policy in Congress, is by providing
in the bill submitted lor enactment absolute safe
guards apain't such a contingency. These will be
found in limiting the amount of land that may be
leased to one individual or one corporation and safe
guarding the leases against subletting and against
ciTihination between leaseholders. There may be
established a unit of area, say of twenty sections to
one individual or one corporation or one partnership.
This unit will find a few cattle-owners already using
this domain with more stock than it will feed. The
element of flexibility to accommodate such a situa
tion and protect such owners against what would
really be a forced sale, and therefore a sacrifice of
their stock, may be found in providing that in such
cases the brand book and other evidences of the
number of the herd shall be taken and the unit
be extended by the Secretary of the Interior. We put
the unit at twenty sections merely for illustration. It
may be found necessary to enlarge or reduce it, but
a unit should be fixed, subject only to modification
in the cases suggested. The West requires restora
tion of these ranges, but it also needs that such res
toration shall imply also an increase of population.
In other respects these leases should provide ccrtaiu
official oversight. The bunch and gramma grasses
are annuals. They are the most valuable forage of
the ranges. Their valuable property is that they be
come hay standing on the ground and a very nutri
tious dry food. When they are consumed green they
drop no seed for the next year's crop. If permitted
to dry their seed is ripened, and in browsing the stock
thrashes out the seed, tramps it into the ground and
it germinates the next anr.ual crop. The ranges have
been overstockrd. The reed of the stock for food
has compelled it to gnaw the green grass to the
roots, no seed has ripened and the ranges have be
come barren. By this process, too, the ranges have
become increasingly arid. The former abundant
clothing of herbage conserved the rainfall from im
mediate evaporation, it went into the ground and
served as a solvent for plant food, thereby increasing
every year the annual crop of these rich grasses!
Nature worked through the agency of the herds of
buffaloes on the Kocky Mountain ranges to preserve
these grasses. The herds passed northward on their
;mm:al migration, grazing hastily as they passed and
leaving untouched grass to seed for the next crop.
On their return southward the grasses were dry, the
seed ripe and in graring the hay they sowed the seed
and trampled it in. In this way, with no limit to
their increase except the Indian demand upon them
for their meat and hides, the buffaloes always had
abundant food, and when they were exterminated
they left the ranges rich in grasses, to be the means
of that meteoric rise in the range cattle business
which made Wyoming the greatest stock region in
the Union. But the Wyoming cattlemen, like their
kind everywhere, made no study of the means of
keeping their ranges fertile and now they are prac
tically barren.
It that the Government must enforce
r the lnv. - F 4 tore on the part
â¢ndo the mischici already wrought
.iorancc and greed.

iile campaign with considerable eventualities

enerally muddle out right in the end. But, what
ever happens, there can be no mistake about this â
we have | this thing through. It may cost
us more battalions than we have lost, it may cost the
of more officers and men, and will cost us more
than we 1 may cost us millions we
Hut there is one thing certain â
we mean to see this thing through. '
Rotebery was at lea^t candid and few will ques
tion the accuracy of his statement (ireat Britain
herself into the war and will doubt
less muddle through it. All reports agree that the
I>!e is determined to

men, we have the money, too." Nothing is said vz

Many a British general and statesman has had
reason to make a similar assertion. At this very

The menace to the British lay in the possibility
that General White's army might be overwhelmed in

themselves with merely g the British garri

and strike for freedom. It appears, however,
they underrated the British about as much as the
British underrated them, and undertook to capture
the three cities at once. As the situation stands now
the advantage is with the British and is increasing on
that side every day. Buller may soon be able to re
lieve Ladysmith and then at his leisure prepare for
an advance upon Pretoria. He has the men and his
Government at home has the means of furnishing
more if he needs them. As Rosebery said, the war
may cost many millions more than statesmen dream
of, but of the end there can be little doubt. The
British will muddle through it.
rROM the annual report of Mr. Chamberlain,
Commissioner of Navigation, it appears that
there lias been a striking contrast between the
progress made in the development of our coast trade
and inland water shipping and the lack of progress
in the upbuilding of our merchant marine engaged
in foreign trade. For the one class of shipping there
has been protection, and as a result it has prospered
or industries during the past year, but our ocean
vessels have been left to compete unaided against the
subsidized essels and as a consequence our
ocean trade is in the hands of the foreigner.
According to the report the tonnage operating
under our coasting laws, 21,397 vessels of 4,015 >jj
gross tons, is the largest in our history and greater
than the 1 I innage of any other nation. Our
2476,011 tons, for the first time ex
ceeds the torn of all other craft In the rest of
the world steam tonnage eleven years ago exceeded
sail tonnage. Our tonnage rc^terd for foreign
trade, however, remains small, and I American
vessels carried a fraction less than 0 per cent of our
exports and imports, the smallest percentage in our
history.
From the statistics cited it appears the world's sen
going sail tonnage in the past quarter of a century
has decreased from 14,185,836 tons to - tons,
a decrease of 40 per cent The decrease in the United
- has been at the average rate. The world's sea
going tonnage in the same period has increased from
4..U'{>.iO3 tons to 18,887,132 tons, or 306 per cent. The
phenomenal increases have been Norway's 1400 per
cent and Germany's nearly 700 per cent. The increase
of the United States has been only 68 per cent, and
the increase of American steam tonnage registered
for foreign trade on Atlantic and Gulf coasts has been
only 38 per cent.
Ihe fact that the tonnage engaged in coasting
trafnc is the largest in our history is a proof that
there is no lack of energy in American shipbuilding,
and the further fact that in substituting steam for
sailing vessels we have kept pace with the rest of the
world is an evidence that our energy is not unenlight
ened - I* 're. clear that our failure to ad
vance as rapidly as other nations in the extension and
in-rease of our ocean marine must be due to some
thing else than a lack of energy or industrial skill.
NÂ«T do we have to look far to find the reason.
The report show? that last year the leading nations of
Europe together with Japan expended over $26,000,
Â°Â°Â° ' te their merchant shipping, while the
â¢es expended only fgg&ail.
lit of the wisdom of European nations in
ling up their shipping while we have neglected
OOrs the United States within the last twenty years
have dropped from the second place next to Greit
Britain t<> fourth position, below Germany and
France, and, if steamships in forei-n trade alone are
considered, below Norway and Spain and only
slightly ahead of Japan.
1 a any stronger argument for a comprehensive
shipping bill be made than is furnished by that |]
It is bad enough to know that oi our foreign
trade less than 0 per cent is carried in our own ships,
but it is worse to be reminded that our great republic
with its v.-iÂ«t commerce, its frontage on the two
mighty oceans of the globe, has a smaller ocenn
- steam tonnage than Norway or Spain and but
little more than Japan. Surely it is time to rouse ir>.
1 for the promotion of American sin
is a necessity of the time.
C CONSIDERABLE attention was given a few
months ago to the decision by a Unti-h court
that Lord Rosebery had do ri^ht to republish
without permission a report oi a speech made by him
but published and copyrighted by the London Times.
It is, therefore, worth noting that the decision has
been reversed by (he Court of Appeal. The em!,
however, is not yet in sight, for the Times has ar
ed [or an appeal to the House of Lords in the
tation that the original decision will be up-
The case is one of more than ordinary interest be
the complexity of the questions involved
and the far-reaching effect which a decision either
uiil have upon the whole copyright law. It will
tnembered th.it Rosebery, when preparing for
publication a volume of his speeches and addresses
included among them several which had been report
ed and printed in the Times. The claim was made by
the Times that these reports were its own. Rosebery
had uttered the words, but he had not written them
out, revised them, cast them in literary form nor per
formed any of the other work upon them which
fated them for publication. Therefore it was argue 1
by the Times that Rosebery had no right to the
speeches as printed. They were the property of the
reporter who had written them down and sold them
to the Times. That view of the case was taken by the
Judge whose decision has just been reversed, and
judgment was accordingly given against Rosebery.
From the brief reports which have come to us it
appears that the ground on which the appeal was
iied was that the original decision reduced the
right law to an absurdity. It was pointed out
that if sustained it would place every lecturer and
speaker in Great Britain wholly at the mercy of
stenographers. A reporter would only have to write
out a report of a speech or a sermon, copyright it
and get it printed in some form, to have an exclusive
property in it against the man who had spoken it.
The Master of the Rolls is reported to have said
the plaintiff was asking the court "to turn the copy
right law which was created for the benefit of authors
into an act for the benefit of reporters." When the
counsel for the Times said that he simply relied upon
the same argument as that which established copy
right in the judgments i â  . an<l reminded the
Master of the Rolls that it "would be a serious thing"
if there were no copyright in the judgments of the
law reports, the Judge rather gruffly said, "I do not
agree that the Times reporter is the author of my
judgments!"
Thus the famous case stands at present. It will be
, for the Lords to determine finally whether property
! in a speech belongs to the man who composes it and
speaks it or to him who first puts it in written form
and publishes it. It is n contest between the author
and the reporter, v.ith the publisher standing by to
see from which he will have to snatch the bone aftc
, the fight is over.

affair was purely Informal ami its main
object was to bring tht; visitors nnd the
women of California clotscr together.
When the reception was first suggested
ihÂ« arrangtmÂ«"ntÃ were placed in thÂ»>
hands of Mrs. S. A. O'NVil and Mrs. Me

Much credit is due the ladles who had

Forty-third sailed from New York on the
transport Mendo last Â«â¢â < Only two
companies of that regiment were re
cruited out here.
There Were the usual crowds down at
the transport wharf during the day, but
there was very little excitement. None of
the soldiers were allowed outside the
gates and In consequence there was no |
corporal's guard rounding up the men at i
sailing time.
The transport Tartar has again come !
under unfavorable comment, this time '
from Mrs. Hrett. at whose residence at
the Presidio Mrs. Collins, the widow of I
Captain Charles Collins, died. Mrs. lirett |
declares thai while â  passenger on the ,
Tartar and on her way home from Ma
nila, Mrs. Collins was shamefully neg- !
lected. and that this neglect was the dl- !
reel cause of her death. As in all such â¢
complaints, General Shaftei has detailed '
an otllcer. this time Major Gallagher, j
chief commissary, to gather the facts of
the case.
At the time Mrs. Collins arrived at the
Presidio It was stated that her mind was
unbalanced. She was known as â  very I
sick woman, and her life â â¢â¢â¢â¢. even then
despaired of. She was at Hongkong when
the Tartar arrived there on Its way home
and she took passage upon the transport
there. There are no provisions on board j
the transports for the ire of women In i
such health as Mrs. Collins then was. j
There are very few provisions for women .
on the transports In any case, and those j
who allowed Mrs. Collins to come homo .
on the Tartar must have understood that (
as well as any one here. She received
What care a woman will receive on a yes- j

was that a woman in nuch a condition

WAS NOT FAVORED
Decis'on Is Against the
Portland Jobbers.
Fr^lal Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or.. Nov. 20.â 1n the United
States Court to-day Judge Bellinger ren
dered â  decision sustaining the demurrer
of the defendants in the case of Allen H.
Lewis, representing the Jobbers of Port
land, against the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company and the Oregon
Short Line Railroad for alleged violation
of the long and short haul clause of the
Interstate commerce act. Judge Bellinger
in his decision says:
"The complaint Is thnt the Short Line
and the Southern Pacific have made a
joint tariff for freight between Ban Fran
cisco and I<luho .mis under which the
same rate is charged as that charged by
th.- joint tariff of the Short Line and the
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
; pnny from Portland to the Mine points,
and under which the Short Line receives
notably much lean for its haul than It
receives on Portland freight. That the
I object of this is to give San Francisco and
its merchants an undue and unreasonable
I preference over Portland and tin mÂ«-r
[ chants, and that the Oregon Railroad and
i Navigation Company is aiding and abet
ting this purpose by â¢ : â¢â¢â ! Ing Into the
joint tariff arrangement In question with
the Short Line Company.
"Th. complainant Is proceeding upon
the theory thai the action of the Short
Line Company in entering Into a joint
tariff arrangement with the Southern Pa
cific by which it receives â â < .-mailer rate
as its proportion of throueh haul under
1 that arrangement than it receives for Its
proportion of the haul under its Joint
tariff agreement with the Oregon Railroad
and Navigation Company has the effect
to make both Joint tariffs discriminate
against Portland, : nd therefore unlawful.
Then; is no complaint that the Oregon
Railroad and Navigation Company rate
from Portland to Huntlngton is excessive
or dlscrlininatlnir. nor is there any com
plaint that the excessive above the Ore
gon company's rate charged and received
by the Short Line Company an Its share*
.-I the joint rate, nor that the Joint rate
established by the two companies, i* un
just or unreasonable except as the
charges are related to the charges made
under the Joint tariff established by the
Southern Pacific and the Oregon short
Line companies. The allegation as to the
unreasonableness of the joint rat.* made
by the Oregon Railroad and Navigation |
Company and the Short Line Is that 'in ;
consideration of the premises'â in consid
eration of the alleged discrimination
against Portland merchants in the two
Joint rates and of the lower charge for
the longer haul to Oregonâ such rate Is
unjust and unreasonable and In violation
of section 1 of the Interstate commerce
act. The case la therefore one of alleged
unlawful discrimination in thÂ»Â» rates com
plained of, and unless there is such dis
crimination there Is no ground for relief.
The fact that the Short Line Company
under its Joint tariff arrangement with the I
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company
receives ratably more for Its haul than it
receives under its tariff arrangement with
the Southern Pacific Company Is not a I
matter cognizable by the court."
L. B. Cox, counsel for Allen & Lewis.
stated to-day that he WOUld file ;l:i; l: i
amended bill which would obviate most
of the objections found by the court tc
the original bill.

While Fpccial Treasury Agent Converee
J. (Smith was In this city a few weeks
ugo making thÂ« usual examination of
t'uptuui-huusc *iffairs he had many con
ferences with l'ort Collector Jarkson
â with r< spoct to the n:<>de of handling the
Inr^o number of Chinese Immigrants ar
nvu.g hero by every pupseneer steamer
from the Orient. Mr. Smith had found
that nijiwlthhtanuins that the Chinese Ku
re&u had a lari;Â«.r lorÂ«.e than over before,
there was a vrry large number of Chinese
Immigrants waning at the detection shed
tit tl.e Mull Dock to be lanucd. Collector
Jackson was so much overrun with Chl
*<â¢â <â  business, he taid, that he had barely
time to attend to bis other duties as Col

lie uaa oU:j;eu to inform the swarm of at

that hn would Rive them v. hearing only

*it the time he would devoto to the Cus

The Collector called AkÂ« nt Smith's at

p>>rt, oould x.ct sign papers 111 his nuine
and plve the necessary orders for the

of their landing. Owing to this fart it
was necessary Jor the Collector to devote
a vi ry Urge part of the time persur.ally
to Chinese immigration matters, the most
r>f which could Le dono by a deputy col

Evidently the management of tho
Grand Opera-houw serins to be a strict
believer in variety. Comic opera, ro
mantic opera and grand opera have been
successfully produced at the Grand and
it was thought a good idea to present an
extravaganza. Rice's â â¢KvaneHine" has
scored a great hit during Its production
In the Hast, not so much because of th-<
cleverness of the plot as because of the
series of bright vaudeville sketches that
filled out the gaps. What was good of
Hice'B production may be said of the
performance ai the Grand. The plot is
| mostly out of sight.
Bat the particular feature that makes
"Evangellne" digestible is a bevy of as
pretty and graceful girls as you can see
anywhere. They sing exquisitely, dance
gracefully and march with a martial
spirit that keeps the house trembling be
neath thunderous applause. Surely the
girls captured the audience last night
and will no doubt do so during the re

He made certainly a successful â¢maiden

an Impersonation as 1 have ever seen.
Bert neslle overacts the part and ought i
to be squelched.
Jack Robertson Is on the programme |
as the "rebellious calf" (specially en
gaged). Armur Wooley does pome good
German dialect work as the captain of
the guard and even Oom Paul Is not miss
ing. The gem of the opera is a dashing
march in the third act, which alone Is
worth the trouble to go to the Grand for
this week. In fact, a few more numbers
like the minuet and this march Would do
a great deal of good and liven things up
a bit. The stage manager deserves a
great deal of praise for his able arrange

ALFRED METZGER.
California.
Comedy has Its place In the great Amer
ican heart and melodrama In the great
American hysterics, but the melo-coraedy
is not located. Those who went to tho
California to laugh at "Yon Yonson"
found the humor rudely distorted by old
'. Morosco heroism seasoned with the salt
Jof several tears. The other part of the
audience, drawn thither by log-jam al
lurements, found a curtain whisked down.
] before the melo moment had fairly begun.
I Hence disappointment.
The comedy hi retailed In adulterated
form and the melodrama is wishy-washy.
But the primitive love of a show for the
: show's Bake asserts Itself when a play
moves as actively as "Yon Yonson." It
is distressing when one attempts to class
ify. But it serves as castors to move
Arthur Donaldon about the country and
Arthur Donaldson keeps "Yon Yonson"
on the road and the combination is pleas
ant all round.
The whole play has the advantage of
, finish that results from a one-piece reper
toire. The people who play It can rightly
be expected to have done the most that
In them lay with the parts assigned, hence
there Is no reason to excuse any one of
them. It would please a mild spirit to
pardon Mr. Bender for his Ifarkens. but
it really seems impossible under the cir
| cumstances. In appearance he is a cross
between the bandit of opera and the high
j wayman of a delirious brain. After pre
i senting this appearance and hissing a siz
zling hatred he retires until It is time to
hiss again.
Above the stratum of Mr. Bender Is a
large one of mediocrity and above this
lies Mr. Donaldson. He makes a good
i enough Swede to win over the one part
of his audience and he redeems himself
In the eyes of the other part by a copious
weep into his bandana over the memory
of his little sister which arrives just In,
time to pave the game.
Mr. Donaldson's songs are the most
agreeable part of the entertainment.
Rendered minus the prlma donna gestures
they would be charming. On the whole
he Is a rather nice person to spend the
evening with.

Alhnmbra.
There was another packed house at the
Alhambra to witness the performance of
the. popular play, "In Old Kentucky,"
which, though In its seventh consecutive
season, appears to have a strong hold on
the affections of theater-goers. The pro
duction is superior to that, presented at
the Columbia two years ago, and the
company is In every particular a capable
one. The several thrilling scenes in the
play are brought out with a realism that
is positively exhilarating. The pickan
nlny band, which has always been a
strong feature of the performance, Is bet
ter than ever with Its two drum majors.
The buck and wing dancing by Swinton
and Bowen Is the best ever seen here. The
exciting race scene Is as thrilling as ever,
and Elsa Ryan, who disguises herself as
I a Jockey and wins the race, earns unstint
ed applause both for the naturalness of
I her acting and for the feeling manner in
â  which she sings "Old Kentucky Home."

LIEN LAW HELD
INVALID BY THE
SUPREME COURT
Declares It to Be Un
constitutional.
POPULAR STATUTE NULLIFIED
A DECISION THAT DISFAVORS
CLASS LEGISLATION.
Appellate Court Believes That Work
ingmen Are Capable of Deciding
When They Should Receive
Their Pay.
The Supreme Court has punched a hole
1 In another Legislative act in a decision
handed down yesterday in the case of An
drew Johnson against the Goodyear Min
i Ing Company. Johnson brought action to
recover wages from the corporation for
' labor performed by himself and other
'miners.* who had assigned their claims to
him. In the Superior Court of Sierra
. County he received judgment for $5031* 57
and $-100 attorney's fees. The suit was
broueht under the act of the Legislature
1 of 1597, which provided that every cor
poration in this State must pay its em- ,
ployes at least once a month; also, that
it Is unlawful for a mining or other cor
poration to contract to pay for a longer
period than one month. The act further ;
provides that the company, In making an
swer, only aver that the amount sued for
was not due. or that the. laborer was
away at the time that payments were be
ing made. As a penalty for any violation
Of the act the law makes a lien of this !
nature take preference over all other
claims. A line on the corporation for vio
lating the law is provided.
In Its defense the mining company at
tacked the constitutionality of the act,
which is claimed discriminates to the ex
tent that It applies only to corporations
doing business In this State, and not to
any Other class; also, that It does not ap
ply in the cases of thousands of laborers
employed by co-partners In many and va
ried industries of this State. The Supreme
Court takes this view of the law. which
It declares Is unconstitutional, as it Is .'.:
rected against one class of corporations,
and hence was class legislation, and says:
If the Legislature could deprive the corpora
tion of Â«ome of lbs defends which othÂ»r litl
frantÃ on like terms are allowed. it could, by
Draconian edict, deprive It of all of them and
say at once that the corporation shall make no
defense Whatever to the action. The working
man of lntHllfrence Is treated as an Imbecile.
H<lnK over 21 years of age, and not a lunatic or
Insane, he Is deprived of the rlKht to make a
contract as to the time when hiÂ« wages shall
become due. â¢ â¢ â¢ The laborer might be In
terested In the corporation and for some reason
willing to wait until the corporation should
pay him. Y.t the parties, being able to con
tract and willing to contract and desiring for
the roch! of Â»-aoh of them to contract, are by
this statute forbtddra to <!o so.
Having dealt thus with the statute In
general, the Supreme Court directs a mod
ification of the judgment, alllrming that

VOID DEEDS LEGALIZED.
Two Hundred Real Estate Titles Made
Good in Law by Putting on
War Tax Stamps.
Internal revenue officers * have been
making an examination Into the Re
corder's offices on the Pacific Coast and
have been notifying the persons Inter
ested of the provisions of the. war tariff
requiring war tax stamps to be affixed
to deeds, mortgages and other documents
conveying title to real estate. The visit
of a revenue officer to the Recorder's of
flee In this city resulted in bringing into
the Internal revenue office of nearly 2UO
deeds, on which no stamps had been if
fixed, Besides the penalty for a failure
to affix war stamps to such documents,
the document without a stamp is worth
less and will not be received as evidence
In a court. The persons who had been
notified of th. omission of the stamp
brought tlÂ».n deeds to Collector Lynch and
made aflidavlt that the stamps had been
omitted through inadvertence and not be
cause of a wish to defraud the revenue.
Upon this showing the Collector furnished
the required stamp upon being pal for
the same and attixed it to the document
with his certificate that the forms of law
had been complied with, and that he was
convinced that there had been no inten
tion to defraud.
The documents bo decorated will be
good evidence in court. Many of the par
ties to the deeds were unaware that any
stamps were required, and the visit ut
the revenue people came in the nature of
a disagreeable surprise.

difficulty in baring the !n\v amended to
permit the extension to Sw feet.
A piece of news of considerable Impor
tance is involved ln the suggestions of
Mr. Holmes to the Commissioners. He
hus recommended. In the ilrst place, tho
construction of a solid pier to be limÂ» feet
long and 4JO fret wide, from the foot of
about LJiiy *tr*-Â«-t. and also the construc
tion of other wharves, to be s. -.it h of the
lOOil-foot structure, which are shown In
the Illustration that accompanies this ar
ticle. Th^rtt are proposed six new
wharves of the uniform uize of 800x100
feet, ln addition to the 1000-foot pier, and
the nlan is also for an extension of the
Lombard street wharf to 600 feet, which
Involves an extension of 2'XÂ» feet.
"Do not think." â a I Mr. Holmes, "that
we have not been thinking about the ne
cesslty of greater facilities, for we have.
The idea of the 1000-foot pier Is threefold.
In the first place It would serve as a
breakwater and would make easy riding
for vessels at the south of it, all along the
frcnt. wlu-n there is a swell from the
'â¢ctaii. In the second place, such a pier
would give large yard room for the belt
railway, and would bring ship a:. rail
together, In the third place, lt would
furnlfh an outlet for a sewer system."

HAWAIIAN BILL

HIS OPINIONS UNCHANGED
- â  Â»
STILL FAVORS A TERRITORIAL
FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
â¦
Same Conditions Do Not Exist in
Porto Rico and It May Require
Entirely Different
Treatment.
Fpeclgl Plcpstrh to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Nov. 20.-
Senator Cullom. who was chairman of
the Hawaiian Commission, has an
nounced bis intention of reintroduclng
on the opening day of the Fifty-sixth
Congress the bill providing a territorial
form of government for Hawaii. He will
urge action upon this measure, insisting
that it should be disposed of before Con
gress gives serious consideration to any
legislation for other Insular possessions.
"The Hawaiian bill." said the Senator
to-night, "has precedence, and, in my
Judgment, there ought to be early action
upon it. Congress during the coming
session certainly ought to provide a form
of government for both Hawaii and
Porto Rico, but Hawaii should come
first. Congress could have adopted a
form of government for Hawaii at the
last Besslon, and probably should have
done *so. The Hawaiian Commission,
consisting of Senator Morgan, myself
i and Congressman Hitt, having made :i
fiill investigation of conditions in the
Islands", hud reported a bill to Congress
providing a form of government, but the
weighty matters which pressed upon
Congress in consequence of the war with
Spain prevented the Hawaiian bill from
being taken up. The people of Hawaii
have now waited a whole year upon
Congress without a murmur. They are
loyal, patriotic Americana, and they ap
preciate the causes for delay in giving
them a representative government,
These causes no longer exist, and they
have a right to expect early action."
"Do you think committees of Congress
should be sent to Porto Rico and the
Philippines before any bill creating a
form of government for those islands is
considered by Congress?"
"I think it might be well to do so. But
probably In the case of Porto Rico It
may not be necessary. The Porto Ricans
are thoroughly loyal to the l.'nlted
States. There has never been any dis
position among them to question our hov
erelgnty. it may be that Congress can
legislate satisfactorily for th.-m without
Congressional committees visiting the
Island. That will appear later. But
whether It Is necessary to send a com
mittee of Congress to the Island or not
some form of government for the Porto
Illcans ought to be provided before the
conclusion of the coming session. "
"Will the bill reported by the Hawaiian
Commission for the government if the
Hawaiian Islands serve as a model for
a form of government for Porto Rico?"
"it may bo of some us<Â«, but I doubt if
It would answer in all particulars. The
Hawalians are a very different port o{
people from the Porto Rlcans. The Ha
wailans are fully Americanised and have
demonstrated their capacity fur self
povernraent. They speak the Enpllsh
language for the most part and under
stand American Institutions. With the
Porto Kicansjt is different. They have
never had any experience In self-govern
ment. Their training: under Spain has
not been such as to uuaiify them for it.
Few of them speak the English lan
puape. and few have, as yet, a proper
appreciation of the principles of oar re
public. In thÂ»* bfÃinnlnp. therefore,
they may need a different form of gov
ernment from that which we will provide
the Hawanans. ' The difference will be
In details: tho underlying principles, of
course, will be the same."
In reference to the reported Intention
of the President to appoint â¢' civil gov
ernor for Porto Rico immediately,' it
would seem as If the programme to ap
point Assistant Secretary Allen of the
Navy Department has been suspended.
Tho* President told Senator l"..r:ik-r on
Saturday that he doubted now whether
he would make any civil appointment In
Porto Rico until ait. Congress hail had
a chance to legislate on a form of gov
ernment for that island and Hawaii. It
would seem from this remark and
Senator Cullom's interview that the sub
ject has had very recent consideration
at the White House and thai Senators
have advised the President to go slow

The Question of revenue in Porto Rico

SMALL BOYS IN COURT.
Judge Mopan Says Robert McKay Is
Wicked Beyond His Years.
Eight boys, their agos ranging from 10
to 15 years, were before Polios Judge Mo
gan yesterday to answer charges of vio
lating the E o'clock ordinance. They had
been arrested Sunday night on Polsom
â treet by Officers Tracy and Naylor spe
cially detailed for that purpose. Seven
of themâ James Hvnes, George Johnson,
Joseph Smart. John Pellden, James Ly
ons. Jamrs Flannlgan and Willie McKay
were dismissed with reprtmads. Robert
McKay was placed on trial, the court
stating that he believed him to be a very
bad boy. who was leading his 10-year-old
brother astray.
"You were before me once before," said
the Judge to him. "for burglary. The
Jury acquitted you out of sympathy for
your youth and not because you werÂ«*
not guilty. 1 have no doubt of your guilt
on that occasion. You have also been
arrested before for disturbing the peace
and for vagrancy, and have Won In my
court at least five times. Now you are
leading your brother astray, You're *
bad one! 1 '
The policemen told the court that the
12-year-old prisoner and his brother were
the sons of a widow residing at M Bruno
street. Their father died several months
ago. When arrested Willie McKay had a
can of salmon, which Robert said he had
bought from a grocer named McMnn'Js at
Rausrh and Kolsom streets. The court
did not believe the story and ndjournÂ«Â»-J
â¢he trial In order that the grocer might
be summoned.

THE MOST FAMOUS PAINTER OF GERMANY.

THE WORLD'S GREAT ARTISTS
V. ALBRECHT DUREB.
Given a fair endowment of talent with
only modest means, the task of the art
student In these days, even In our own
land, seems more or less of a simple aft
fair, for though the environment is not I
always as esthetic as could be desired, j
and though we cannot lay claim to being j
a very artistic race, at- 'east we have good
schools, fair galleries, excellent private i
collections, and at worst Europe Is only a
week's Journey from our eastern seiÂ»- !
board. In the fifteenth century, however.
In Germany, when Albrecht Durer, son of
a goldsmith of the same name, was born, '
ALBRKCHT OL'RHR.
(After the portrait by himself In the Ufflzi fallery, Florence.)
there was little In an art way to stir the
Impulses of the young man Â«bo was des
tlnf-d to shed so grand a luster on his
country's iiame.
Art flourished only modestly In the rude
middle ages in a country like Germany,
where the. social side of life was unde
veloped and where nature herself was
none too kind to man. Of national life at
that time there was little; small princi
palities, each dominated by a petty
Prince, preyed upon each other and made
conditions that were far from fostering
art. However, Id the two free imperial
cities of Nuremberg and Augaberg there
developed the greatest pair of artists of
which Germany boosts and among those
which the world has yet produced. One
was Hans Holbein, the other, the subject
of this paper, was Albrecht Durer, no
less able as a painter than as an engraver,
though better known to posterity by his
skill In the latter direction. Genuine,
original. Inventive and dexterous to â 
marvelous degree, he imitated no man,
but blazing a path for himself he set an
example for Kenerations of art. to
come, to whom he has been an Inspiration.
a guide and a shining example. All this
he accomplished In a modest manner or
the pure love of his art; he was ambi
tious, but not for worldly favors, being
desirous only to excel in his profession as
a master worker; he cared little for hen
ors, and went his way modestly, striving
ever to perfect his technique, to Improve
his drawing and to widen his scope In
painting. He lived a life of great use
fulness and probity, and dying left behind
him the splendid fruits of his labor, every
scrap of which is now prized as a pre-
memento of a veritable master of
his art.
Above all. It must be remembered that
Albrecht Durer was a pioneer In his art.
for before his time little had been done
to popularize art in his country or make
it a factor In the life of the times. He
not only stands out with the utmost prom
inence In the history of Germany, but he
ha* left an Imprint on the whole history'
of art since his time, and this is some
thing that may be said of few men. The
Ptory of his life, though simple. Ib inter
esting and worth the telling, and hid own
words may be quoted In excuse. In a draft
of a book on proportion which he had
planned he says: In this matter I Will,
with the help of God, set forth the little
1 have learned, though It will seem out
v poor thing to many. Hut this does not
trouble me, for I know well that it Is
â¢â¢aaler to llnd fault with a thing than to
make something better."
1 Hirer's family was of Hungarian ori
gin. His father came to Nuremberg In
1405 and Albrecht. who was born In 1471,
... May 21, was one of eighteen children,
only three of whom grew up, the other*
dying early. The father became promi
nently Identified wltll the art of the gold
smith, and an soon as Albrecht was old
enough he was set at the sami trad Al
though he had â¢:nall Inter st in this work,
he labored diligently, and pleased his
father bo much that when he finally con
frssed his discontent with goldmn
and his desire to become a painter his
wishes were respected and '.â¢ wa* ap
prenticed to the painter Michel Wolge
mut. one of the few in that guild in the
ancient city, but all the best. There is
preserved In the Albertlna collection In
Vienna a drawing made by Albrecht at
the age of 13. done in silver point, a like
ness of himself, which show* remarkable
talent and already a knowledge of the
handling of his medium so characteristic
of the man In later life.
About the time of the artists birth
Gutenberg's great Invention of tinting
Was brought from Mifyence to Nurem
berg, and Aibrecht'i master, Wolgcmut,
with his partner, Pleydenwurff were later
employe d to make Illustrations for books
published about H'jO. Thus the young
man wej profoundly interested and
brought In close contact with such work
In which he was shortly to excel, in 1453
his apprenticeship terminated, and his
father sent him off for a four-year wan
dering tour to acquire travel what he
could in relation to his art. Such was
the custom at that time. He visited vari
ous German towns and studied for a while
with a brother of the famous Martin
Schongauer. the most distinguish* en
graver of his day, who, though dead, had
left traditions which his brother carried
out in the school established by the fa
mous man. Flnully he arrived at Venice,
where he made the close acquaintance of
Jacopo del Hat in, one of the leading
painters In Venice i . for* Giorgione and
Titian. P.arbarl was also an engraver,
and he first Introduced ' irer to the pro
portions and measurement of the human
body as a subject for study. While In
Venice Dun r painted a charming portrait
of himself, which Is now In the collection
of llirr Bugen Felix at Leipzig. He was
summoned home by his father, who had
arranged a marriage for him with Agnes,
the daughter of one liana Frey. who gave
as a dowry with the young woman 200
gulden.
The ceremony took place July 7, H3l,
and Durer turned for a livelihood to en
graving, working on copper at first. The
compositions were of liibllcal or allegori
cal subjects, as was the manner of the
times and which had a popular Interest.
Many of them were from the Apocalypse.
The omnipresence and omnipotence of
Death, which had SO powerful a hold on
the popular imagination at this date,
were also frequent themes with Durer
These works were Instantly successful and
found a ready Hale; Indeed, they were al
most Immediately pirated and copies wer*Â»
put upon the market. The drawing in
each case was appealing and It was full
of sentiment and imagination. delightfrMy
executed and quite novel in the manner of
handling, a fact that the public was not
slow to recognize. Between times tie
painted and In this he was far more In
terested; but there was not always a de
mand for his pictures; he confined him
self almost entirely to portraiture with
occasionally a religious subject, but with
the advance of printing thÂ»re enrae oppor
tunities for wood engraving, of which ha
did much. Wood engraving at that tlmo
was In a feeble state of progress, little
above the level of a mechanical craft It
la due to Durer that the art was brought
to a high rank, for he Inaugurated a new
era of wood engraving as a pictorial nrt.
Durer .iow made a second visit to Ve
nice, gnin* alone and rinding apprecia
tion among the newer mÂ«n who had
â prune up since his first visit. He did
well there financially and wtl even of
fered a tlnccnn post, with a good i>al
nry. by the Venetian Council If he would
take up a permanent realdpr.ee In that
city; cut love for
home and his native
city prevailed and
he returned to Nu
remberg In 1307.
where commissions
now came in for
paintings, and his
ambition was aatl.t
tied at last. Tho
Elector of Baxony,
Frederick the Wise,
commanded a largo
picture, but when it
was completed it
had cost more In
time and exponso
than the sum paid
for it and â till
another painting wa^
ordered, over which
there was much dis
cussion as to price.
Durer finding in the
end that he v. i-Â»
making nothing with
his great canvas.-.-*,
and he concluded In
the future to stick
to engraving. How
ever, he was still oc
casionally lured toto
picture m a k I n.g.
though always to
hid financial disad
vantage. Among hl3
engravings were a
set representing the
"Life of the Holy
Virgin." the "Pas
sion of J c s v d
Christ" and other
religious subjects.
Durer was the tlrst
to make use of the
art of etching with,
acid on metal, if. n-
aeea. no was not tne actual discoverer or
the process.
In February. 1512, there cam? to Nurem
berg the Emperor Maximilian, untl with
his advent Durer thought he saw opened
un a career of riches and Klory. The nnÂ»
bit|..n of this monai n was to excel In
every direction. 11.- was lavish in his
patrol of all the fine arts, of every
thing. In fact, that could odd to his clory.
and it must be added that he concerned
him? elf little with the somewhat Import
ant part of settling the bill* due to th<Â»
men of genius he thus encourajred. It
seemed to him that the wood engravings
of Durer could be turned to hi* account
and glory If he wero made the wubject of
some spirited picture that nhould find cir
culation about the country, so he com
missioned the artist to make a series of
elaborate woodcuts representing his Maj
e.sty In a splendid procession, riding under
a triumphal arch. Ninety-two blocks did
Durer deaign. and they were superb; but
although he appealed and appealed, never
a penny was he paid for the work. Ho

chilled by a rumor that two gold mines had
been wrecked. Africans broke and thereon the
market weakened. Consols fell 4. to 1034.
The market began talking of dear money again.
Americans were quiet and firm until New York
becon selling them, and the closing was Irre

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Nov. 20.â The strength of Liver- i
pool was the prime factor in the local wheat
pit at the opening. The predictions of a small â 
Increase in the visible and In local stocks
were potent influences. Initial prices â Decem
her at 07 ! t .- and May at 71'Â«S71\câ were â¢Â«??
J , â¢â¢ over Saturday's closing figures. At no time

bushel?, which, however, was at Chicago, the
lakes and canal, as the outside decreased
200.000.
Chicago opened firmer. In sympathy with an
advance at Liverpool and Parts. The world's
shipments for the week were 7,200,0W bushels,
of which the Continent took 4,000,000. The mar
ket was very dull, thoajgh a good demand for
export was reported at New York and Montreal.
This higher cables Indicated a demand, but it
was offset by December liquidation, under
which prices declined, though the tone was
firm at the decline. Lisbon took 100.000 bushels
of No. 2 red.
Futures were weak. The spot market was
dull and unchanged.

WA .MIS AKI.N FOR A JUDGE
I Attorney Garrlty drew up fome papers of
beparation and also did considerable legal
work straightening out the estate between
the Latigguths. They owned about J5 I >/J
worth oi property, and agreed on sepa
rating that he should take the personal
property and she should retain the home
on i-'ifth street. After a time this arrango
nient was not -satisfactory to Langguth,
and he engaged Attorney A. A. Moore to
makÂ«Â» a demand for $I'MÂ«. a motto. â¢'Home,
Sweet Home." which had been worked by
his sister, and an antiquated sewing ma
chine.
Mr- Langguth positively refused to let
a man whum she charged with having so
little respect for home, sweet home have
the precious motto or the sewing machine,
much less JlOuO.
Time after time, said the lady, she viÂ«
itÂ«-d her attorney ami in her mind believed
that her suit had bten tiled, and that she
had given her testimony before a Court
Commissioner. She brought her witnesses
over to be examined, and the !a<iy also
declares that s>he paid successive fees for
all these services, apparently thinking
that lu-r lawyer was a Judge. After a
time she thought Uie decree ihuuicl be
about reedy, but her attorney did not
have it for her. She then consulted At
torney Fred L. Button, told her story,
discovered that no suit had ever been
brought and through him obtained a de
cree of divorce.
Fred L. Hutton. the attorney of record,
was asked to-day why Mrs. Langgguth
had circulated euch a peculiar story. "1
was very much surprised at what she
told me, taid he. "and certainly if her
ftory be not straight ehe is extraordi
narily well acquainted with legal terms
and forms. Sh* toM me that shÂ«- believed
she had done everything nÂ«-cessary to se
cure a divorce except receive the decree. I
did not know until after 1 brought thÂ«
suit that both the lady and her husband
had been married In Germany before they
came to this country. She. however, told
me that she firmly believed that the de
serted snousi-s in Germany had both ob
tained divorces since 6he and Langguth
left that country. I paid little attention
to the lady's story, as It did not dltectly
concern her divorce suit, which was her
only litigation in which I was lmorested.
"When the husband looked into mat
ters further and saw how mill was the
complaint for divorce and how much mur''
which would admit of proof mlt;ht have
be^n brought into It he Instructed Attor
ney A. A. Moore to notify me that he
withdrew his demand for the motto, sew
lrg machine and the $10<\i. ad that he
would not contest the suit."
"This is a most remarkable story," said
Attorney ..rrity, "and possibly one With
out a precedent. There has been consid
erable lovÂ»-rr.aking by both Langguth and
his wife for the past twentv-nve years,
and It Is not easy to say just where they
have landed. Certainly I cannot conceive
how a llvorce has been granted Mrs.
Langguth, because there were no legal
grounds opon which It could be grant
â¢d. Mrs. Ljngguth was originally, so she
has told me. the wife of a German. She
lived with him in Germany some time
after their marriage and then eloped to
thH country* with Langgutn, who was a
sub-officer in the German Hussars. I Ul
timately Â«he married Langguth in Chi
cagoâat least she Is Of the opinion that
she did. but as she has never been di
vorced from her first husband and could
not be under the German law for any ex
isting cause, It was naturally Impossible
for her, being married, to become the wife
of Langguth. Although she apparently
did not know it. she committed bigamy In
Chicago. Afterward th*y came to live
(â¢x. this coast and acquired much property.
They quirreled and she transferred her
love, while Lanrguth did the same. She
Is r.ow llvlig In Jsorth Oakland, acting as
housekeeper to a Mr. Norman, a candy
maker. Langguth is proprietor of a grii
cerv store at Tenth and Niitoma streets
In San Francisco and he could not have
made any contest in the divorce case or
It would not have been granted.

that the girl had stolen 50 cents from her grandmother, and whom Su

Berkeley In the hope that she might be reformed and thus avoid com

Mrs. Dr. Barrows reported the disappearance to Judge Hall to-day and
through the Sheriff the Constables and all officers have been notified to keep a
sharp lookout for her. Mrs. Dr. Barrows states that she had treated the
Kill with the utmost kindness and had tried hard to make matter? as pleas
ant for her as possible, but that yesterday she suddenly took French leave.
It is intimated, moreover, that the girl claimed to have bi-en mar
ried by contract recently to a young man residing near her mother's home at
Fruitvale. Should the pirl be apprehended some very interestiriK develop

ALAMEDA WANTS
TO SET IN HER
PROPER CLASS
Municipal League Is
Now Ready lo Act.
AI.AMKI'X. NoV MLâ At a meetinp of
the Municipal League of Alan^ia held
at Llndermsn's Hall this evening, the
r committee made its report,
which . jaed. While AJanu
: 1 1 . r of the fifth class It
is entitled to th< privileges of v dty of
the third class, and the report outlines
what will probably !>â¢â¢ the new charter
that will be adopted in the near future.
The repoi - In i>art :
Perhaps the leading objection that may be
urged against our present organic law la that
our citizeiib have hud little voice In making
and can have very little In amending It. All
amendments thereto must be by act of the
1-egit.laturv. Such action may be brought about
by the influence of any one of the tiiirt.-rii
cities in this State which are cities of the fifth
class. The influence moving In favor of a i>ro
pcted amendment may be. and often has been,
one not lii harmony with the interests of Ala
meda. On many points the Interests of the
several cities are not common to all. At each
session of the Legislature since the original
enactment or the organic law there have been
amendments to the charter, most of these nay-
Inrt been secured by Influence exerted by others
than our citizens. Some of, them have been
inimical to the Interests of our city.
FurthernnÂ«e. thÂ« Legislature may at any
time be induced to amend our organic law by
the pressure of influence not In the Interest
oÂ£ any city of the lUth class, but opposed to
the general good of all.
Ac a r<-!>ult each session of the Legislature
brings a season of unreal and requires a watch
fulness on the jiart of our citizens and our
legislative representatives lest a harmful
chanKe be made in our organic law.
This would bÂ» a forcible objection even If
our charter as it btands were a satisfactory
Instrument, It Is far from being such. It baa
many hhortcomlnt". We cull attention to a.
few of the leading ones.
Firstâ The lack of a system of checks upon
the expenditure of the city funds.
Secondâ l-ack of proper enforced supervision
over the various department* of the city gov
ernment.
Thirdâ system Of electing school directors
Is Inadequate to the production of the best
Fourthâ The election by popular ballot f f the
City Clerk and City Attorney is objectionable.
Having thus reported In favor of the desira
bility of a new charter, it Is proper that we
report regarding the necessary steps to be
taken for the attainment of that end. They are:
Firstâ A proclamation Issued by resolution
of the noard of City Trustee*, and published as
required by law. calling for an election of
fifteen freeholders and setting a date therefor.
This election may be held at a general or at
a special election. There will be no general
election until the Presidential election of No
vember. l!Â»00. at which time the issues of a na
tional ianii*JÂ»;n would so dwarf the minor local
Issues as to endanger the selection of the best
men as freeholder*. Moreover, the time would
be very short in which to hold an election for
ratification by the people prior to the meet
ing of the L#eislature. Also the excitement
attendant on a national campaign would not
sufficiently die away so as to allow proper con
sideration to be given by the voters to the ques
tion of the charter. We would therefore rec
ommend the calling of a special election dur
ing the early part of the year 1900.
Secondâ Said Board of Freeholders must meet
and proceed to frame a charter to be submit
ted to the people for ratification. Their work
must be completed within ninety days after
election. . .
Thirdâ Said charter so framed must be pub
lished twenty consecutive days and must be
submitted to voters of the city for ratification.
Su< h submission may be either at a general or
a ereclal election. It is desirable that it M
at a special election for the reason that the
constitution requires ,iÂ« a condition of adop
tion thnt "a majority of such qualified elector*
voting thereat shall ratify the same." Those
votts nt a general election which would be cast
blank on the question of the charter would
therefore, under the law. count acainst it,
thereby endangering Its ratification.
Buch charter having been ratified, will then
bÂ«Â» submitted to the State Legislature, and on
approval by it will be the organic law of the
The suggestion has been made that the ques
tion of bonding the city for school purposes
and for the erection of a free library building
be submitted to the people at the same election
at which the freeholders are elected or at which
the charter Is submitted for ratification. This
suggestion is Impracticable, for the reason that
under the law (Municipal Indebtedness Act.
Satutes US9) no other question may be voted
on at an election held to determine the Issu
ance of municipal bonds. Rut some- portion of
expense mlcht be saved to the city by holding
a bond flection on the day Immediately pre
ceding or Immediately following that on which
the election for freeholders or for the ratifica
tion of the charter Is held.

LABOR BENEFITED
BY ORGANIZATION
Gompers on the Results
of Unionism.
Special DUpatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 20.â Samuel Oom
pers, president of the American Federa
tion of Labor, was the only witness be
fore tho Industrial Committee to-day.
Speaking of the union label, Mr. Uom
pers said there were thirty-seven differ
ent organizations now using the label, and
it was growing in popularity very rap
idly. He defended the boycott as a legal
and proper weapon for the worklngraan,
holding that what they had a right as In
dividuals to do they were justified in
uniting with others to do.
In reply to a question. Mr. Gompers said
organized labor viewed tru.-ts simply pjs
their employers. There had Leen rases in
which the organizations benefited by com
binations of capital. It was too early to
decide whether men would be more stead
ily employed by the trusts than by oiher
employers. HÂ»Â» said these combinations
had more Influence In Â«=e.Mirlng legislation
than had unorganized capital. Re took a
position against co-operative themes.
Hayinp that experience had proved that
laborers secured no greater advantage
under them than undf r the wage system.
11^ had no fear for the future of organized
The condition of labor to-day was
better than ever before, and he attri
th*- Improvement to the influence of or
ganized iabor.
Mr. Gompers favored an amendment to
thf constitution fixing a maximum of
hours per day for lal E king of tho
t efff-pt of advanced labor legislation In llf
i ferent States, he said there would be no
backward Fti ;>.
REFORMED FREETHINKER
TALKS OF SECULARISM
ISAAC SELBY DELIVERS AN
INTERESTING LECTURE.
Demonstrates the Fallacies of Athe-
istic Arguments to the First
Chrietian Church Con
gregation.
Isaac Selby of Melbourne; Australia, de
livered an eloquent and Instructive lec
ture on "From Atheism to Christianity
and What I Learned On the Way" at the
First Christian Church, Twelfth street,
between Mission and Howard, last night.
For ten years Mr. Selby was prominently
connected with the Free Thought move
ment in the Australian colonies, and is
thoroughly familiar with the weak points
In the arguments presented in support of
what is termed secularism. He Is a fluent
speaker and his exposition of the falla
cli of the atheists and the truths of the
Christian religion was presented with con
vincing force.
"I do not say that Secularism is wrong
and Christianity Is right simply because
I have renounced the one for the other."
he said. "If I turned Mohammedan to
morrow, it would be no argument against
Christianity, unless I were able to prove
that Mohammedanism was better than
Christianity. So it Is not alone necessary
for me to tell merely the story of my
conversion, but it Is also incumbent upon
me to furnish my readers with cogent
reasons for embracing Christianity."
The speaker declared that secularism
was an ignominious failure as an organ
ized movement the world over, reciting
the collapse of the Australian societies
an an Illustration. 11. also named many
great skeptics and atheists who have in
the past become ea-nest Christians after
spending years of t .eir lives deriding the
teachings of Christ. Among these he
named Benjamin Franklin. Chateau
briand, Lord Littlefleld and Gilbert West.
"The late Robert G. lnger.-*oll. said Mr.
Selby. "defined secularism as 'one world
at a time nnd try and make the most of
It.' " Christianity, by teaching the immor
tality of the soul, leads men to make sac
rifices here for the benefit of their fel
lows. Take. by way of illustration, the
case of Father Damien, who went in
a mission to the lepers Of the Sandwich
Islands. He knew full well that he would
sooner or later fall a victim to the dread
disease, and knowing that his reward was
beyond the grave, went forward with his
work until dlsoase and death claimed him.
Had he believed in one world .it a time
he would naturally have sought for
worldly advancement and left the lepers
to look out for themselves You never
heard of a free thinker making any sac
riilco for the betterment of his fellows.
Secularism Is a purely selfish creed, while
Christianity has been proven to be Â« re
ligion that tends to the uplifting of the
entire human race."
Mr. Belby will lecture at the First
Christian Church to-night, to-morrow
night and Friday night. His subject to
night will be, "Is the Bible God's Truth,
Written by an Inspired Hand?"
MINIATURE ERUPTION
ON THIRD STREET
Gas and Electricity Combined Creates
a Small Volcano. Which Causes
a Sensation.
Theater-Romp people and others who
were on Third street last nljsht nt 11
o'clock w<-- . to a miniature erup
tion In the center of the street. Borne
workmen belonging to the Market Street
Railroad Company vr.-re engaged in brac
ing up the car track where It had punk
over a brok< n s. wet*. In ttye perform
ance of this w.^rk the gas main which
runs parallel with the eastern track was
punctured in sunn- manner, when th* rs
caplng uas cam.- in contact with th
tri<- current as produced by the trolley
cars in passing alongsidt too as
this communication was made there was
a Hash and a small s:z- i \ oil UO Cl
T)iÂ«* lab. r< -r.Â« undertook to quencfa the
blaze by shoveling wet sand Into the gap-
Ing rhasm, but the check was only of a
temporary nature, however, as the fire
still kept burning under the sand, with
the result that It burst out with renewed
force, sending a phower of sand high Into
the air. The eruption, though 'small, had
the effect of scattering the crowd that
had congregated about the acene.
A telephone message was sent to the
gas company's office, which brought Its
employes to the place, and an soon as It
was possible to do so the main was shut
off and the fire extinguished.

UNITARIAN CLUB ON
EDUCATIONAL IDEAS
President Starr Jordan Inveighs
Against the Alleged Necessity
for Rich Professors.
The members of the Unitarian Club of
California and a few Invited guests as
sembled at the rooms of the Merchants*
Club, 222 Sansome street, last night. After
a sumptuous spread had been partaken of
President Sheldon G. Kelloss. chairman
of the evening, announced that the coun
cil had selected as the subject for the
meeting "Educational Progress." and in
troduced David Starr Jordan, president of
the Leland Stanford Jr. University of
California, as the first speaker. Profes
sor Jordan spoke of the rapid growth and
progress of the colleges of America and
declared that the growth had come to
stay and that the end of progression had
not yet been reached.
"There has been a change," said the
professor, "since the time when the col
lege professor was dignified and 'well
dressed' and seldom seen by the student
and the present day of our colleges. What
I considered my best reform is that of
bringing the student and the professor In
closer relation, and where the student has
a leaning toward any study in which he
is likely to be competent keeping him In
close contact with that study and with
the professor of that particular course. .
"The old idea that no one can be a col
lege professor unless ho be wealthy must
be done away with, for when that is true
the energy and the force of colleges is
lost and progress is at an end.
"The colleges should not be filled with
rich men who have poor students . as
coaches, paying their way. to use them a*
servants and diminishing their self-re
sped
"Lectures* phould be given only when
they are worth giving, and good money
should not be wast- in costly books that
are never read or never worth reading.
"In the future we can do away with our
rich professors and teachers and supplant
them with those whose positions depend
entirely on merit."
Dr. Frederic liurk, principal of the San
Francisco Normal School, spoke at length
on "New View Points of Education." and
wan followed by Professor Ellwuod P.
Cubberly, head of the educational depart
ment at Stanford University, upon "Prog
ress in Industrial Education."
Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills of Oakland
spoke upon "The Ideal an.i Education."
Key. Horatio Stebblns. the la*t speaker
of the evening, claimed that he was the
first of his colleagues who combined ath
letics and education, as In his early years
he had been a schoolmaster where it re
quired muscle to decide whether the mas
ter or the students would stay in the
school.
Cuddy Arraigned in Court.
James Cuddy, bartender in Charles
Johnson's saloon. ai.'i Howard street, was
arraigned In Judge Megan's court yester
day on a charge of assault to murder, and
by consent the case was continued till
to-morrow. George Lewis, the "dope
fiend" who attempted to murder Cudtly
and was seriously wounded himself, was
unable to be brought from the Receiving
Hospital, and the rase against him of as
sault to murder was continued.

"Four of the member*â Chairman Bach

and Dr. F. H. Metcalf"â he said, "have
told me that they would resign rather
than be forced to associate with Tebbets

no danger that they will resume any of
their crooked work as long as I am

would quit keep their word, then I will
also step down and out and let Tebbets

"The board has not shown thÂ« right dis
position in Its treatment of this matter.
There has been no inclination to probe to
the bottom of the scandal, while there
has been a determined effort to put the
burden of the affair on to my shoulders.
After the meeting Saturday night the
members advised me that the proper thing
for me to do was to bring criminal
charges against Tebbets. but I could not
fee It that way. I argued that as his ac

as a body, should institute the criminal
proceedings."

GRATIA VANCE WAS A
MUCH MARRIED WOMAN
LAST HUSBAND IS AWARDED
HER CHILD'S CUSTODY.
Court Finds, However. That Deced-
ent's Illegal Husband Was the
Father of the Boy, Who
Is Illegitimate.
After litigation of several weeks Ira
Lincoln Vance has been awarded the cus
tody of his adopted child, Ira Leroy
Vance, the son of his wife. Gratia Vance,
and Devillo Hill, who lived with the
mother under a contract of marriage,
void by reason of the mother's prior mar
riage to Jay Fred Dunne, from whom the
woman had never obtained a divorce and
who was alive at the time of the child's
birth. This explanation of the conditions
leading up to and proved during the liti
gation is better explained in the findings
of fact and conclusions of law tiled by
: Judge Coffey yesterday in the matter of
the application of Julia E. Rhodes for
letters of guardianship upon the person
and estate of the child, and Devillo Hill
I for letters of administration upon the es
tate of Gratia Vance, whom he averred
was his legal wife at the time of her
death. In opposition to these petitions
. Mr. Vance contended that he was the
legally appointed guardian of the child
and the legal husband of the deceased.
In his opinion Judge Coffey says:
1 "Julia Skinner, mother of the child and
daughter of Julia K. Rhodes, and Fred J.
Dunne intermarried at Tribes Hill, N. V .
July 30. 1593. and lived together up to July.
IS!M, when they separated. Subsequently
Mrs. Dunne, under the name of Grace
Dunne, married Devillo Hill and they
lived together up to May. 1895. At that
i time the parties separated, the woman
came to California and In August of IKS
, the child was born. The law of New
York is that all children born out of law

Mr. Jones, two male companions and

INCIDENTS OF RECENT DEALS
WHY W. H. CROCKER RETIRED
FROM S. P. DIRECTORATE.
More Information as to the Value of
Mrs. Stanford's Interest in the
Pacific Improvement
Company.
Inquiries by wire from New York indi
cate thai special significance Is attached
there to tho retirement of \V. H. (
and Edward Scarles from the directorate
of the Southern Pacific Company.
The Call, which gave the reading pub
lic of the Pacific Coast the first news
and the only accurate story relating to
the sale cf the Crocker and Stanford in
terests In the Southern Paciilc, is In
formed that Mr. Scarles rettrea at his own
reijuest. He never manifested any desire
for active participation in the manage
ment of the Southern Pacific. lie pre
ferred rather that his associates, iluijtrird
and Stillman. should look after th>
lnal Hark Hopkins interests in the com
pany, but when C. P. Huntington s.scheine
of reorganization took definite
was BUKkjested that Mr. â¢ -hould
go on the board "f dlractora. ;
lion emanated from Stillman and llub
bard and in obeying it Mr. Bearles sim
ply heeded the advlOS "f riis lawyers.
When the reorganization was effected
there waa no special reason why Mr.
Searles should extend his I'-rm of service,
so he elected to retire. His retlrem.tni
DOt signify thai he has sold nil in
terest In ihe propertj or it, contemplating
a sale. It would not be surprising, how
ever, if Bpejrer &â¢ Co., who seem to have
uniiound d confidence In Southern Pa
should make him an offe/ that would
tempt a *.iie.
