APIA, Samoa, June 16. â As the

formation which confirms ru
mors that have been in circu
lation on shore for the past few
days to the effect that the Commission
era are unable to agree among them
selves upon the final disposition of
Tanu and Mataafa. Commissioner El
iot has taken the high ground all along
that not only must Chambers' decision

powers and the Samoan Government,
but that the boy King must be
In power.'. Chambers retained as Chief
Justice and Mataafa sent into exile.
Mr. Tripp and Baron Bternburg have
acted in harmony up to this time, ob
jecting to anything further than the
sustaining of Chambers' decision,
which they argue is made mandatory
by 'he treaty. They have insisted upon
the abolition of the kingship and would
not consent to any punishment being
meted OUt to Mataafa. It took days
of argument to bring Eliot to a point.
where he would consent to the de
thronement of Tan':, but he was tlnal

.sued. not, however, without the clause
being incorporated Into it that the
Chief Justice was to be continued in
office. The proclamation being merely
preliminary to the final one. Messrs.
Tripp and Sternburg, it is said, have
been hopeful of securing further con
cessions from Mr. Ell 't. which were to
be made public in their final edict. It
has been known, however, that since
June 10, the date the last proclamation
was issued. Justice Chambers. British
Consul Mnxse and Commissioner Eliot
have been conferring together a great
deal, and 'his fact, taken together with

fered from them in their policy during j
the recent troubles." It is needless to
say that this last act of Chambers, on
what must be known to him as the eve
of his own removal, lias caused a tre
mendous sensation. It is believed that
both Mr. Tripp and Baron Sternburg '
will positively refuse to accede to
Chambers' request, and further that
they will now take a position which will ;
admit of no compromise. It is thought j
.that they will insist upon the removal ;

There is no doubt that Tanu and j

them by certain white people who have
! been very active during the recent ,
- troubles and who are supposed to be i

j supposition is that these whites, who

: this youth and his followers as much as :
I possible with the hope that the Ma- ;
I taafa people will rise up and drive them
i from the peninsula, once more demon
| strating that theMataafansarenotlaw
i abiding people and making it plain to the |
j Commission that the Tanu party should
be in control. Mataafa's chief protested
to the Commission several days ago
; against the continued occupation of
; Mulinuu by Tanu's people and were
; promised that they would be speedily
i dispersed. This not having been done,
. a letter was sent to the Commission
j yesterday by Mataafa himself, calling
its attention to the fact that he had
obeyed all of its orders, that he had dis
j armed and disbanded his men and that
i they had all gone" to their homes. He
! therefore asks that Tanu ; and
| Tamasese also be made to obey the or
j ders of the Commission and disperse
their followers to their homes, as was
j promised they would be made to do.
The situation at present is certainly
j not one that promises a lasting peace,
and it looks as if the German Govern
| ment would have acted more wisely had
i it not insisted on the unanimity prin
i ciple. .;
! If Commissioner Elliot refuses to re
i cede from his present ground it js al
most certain that the Commission will
not succeed in concluding the work it
has begun and a conflict between the
two factions of the natives which will
again involve the whites may be ex
pected at an early date. The Mataafa
people are growing extremely sus
picious that they are not being fairly
dealt with. They voluntarily surren
dered their arms and dispersed on the
promise that Tanu's followers would
be made to do similar things. The Tanu
people still, occupy Mulinuu, they still
call themselves the Samoan govern
ment, and even now as the steamer
sails out of the harbor for San Fran
cisco the King's flag is flying in front
of Tanu's hut, seemingly in open de
fiance to the commands of the Commis
sion.

APIA, Samoa, June 16.â The recent
complications over picturesque little
Samoa, which seemed a few days ago
to have been smoothed over, have as
sumed a more serious aspect. There
are rumors of a split In the Commis

trouble owing to the continued nresence
of Chambers, but whether they will
lead to anything more serious remains
to be seen. Then, too, it Is very prob

laborers with a "vjew ot accomplishing j
this end as quickly as possible. !
With the arrival of the Commission,
holding as .it does supreme power and
superseding all of the officials here, it
was hoped that peace would be speed
ily restored in Samoa. It was believed
that as soon as the quarreling Con
suls and the Chief Justice were silenced
matters would be righted. This proved
true in a measure, but Captain Sturdee
of the Porpoise, the most bloodthirsty
of all, made a final attempt to keep up
the trouble by abusing his power. He
was silenced by the Commission before
any serious harm was done, however,
and sent to his ship.

â¢lauded to the skies in the Colonial
papers, has made himself particularly
obnoxious here. . After Admiral Kautz's

JUST FOR FUN
"Sturdee is the man
who during hostilities
made trips up and down
the coasts of Upoluand
Savaii shelling and
burning villages in
which were only inof
fensive old men and
women and children.
When asked recently
why so many or these
villages were destroyed
Sturdee replied : 'Well,
we were out here in
this beastly, God-for
saken country and we
had to have some fun to
keep alive.' This will
give some idea of the
character of the man

fitted him. He enforced martial law
within his territory, although mar
tial law had never been declared.
He compelled white people to remain
in their houses or hotels after sundown,
refusing passes to all. He continually

â¢ n the territory ft often by the Ameri- r
cans and Germans conditions were dif- j
ferent. No white person was interfered
with, and one could pass through their
lines as he pleased without question.
Sturdee, however, seemed to be about
to annex Samoa in the name of Eng
land and turn it over, to the Colonies.
The people dually grew heartily tired of
the man and a strong protest against
his actions was sent to the Commission
on board the Badger. Commissioner
Tripp expressed surprise when he read
this protest. So did Sternburg. Neither
of these gentlemen, although they had
been here two weeks, knew that such
things were taking place. The next day
a hundred or more marines were with
drawn to the ships, the martial law
tactics ceased and the people were no
longer in danger of being, netted
or shot by Sturdee's men. ,

during hostilities, made trips up and
down the coasts of Upolu and Savaii,
shelling and burning villages in which
were only inoffensive old men and wo
men and children. When asked recent
ly why so many of these villages were
destroyed, Sturdee replied: "Well, we
were out here in this beastly God-for
saken country, and we had to have
some fun to keep alive." This will give
some idea of the character of the man,
who, in command of an English war
ship, was presumably sent here to en
force law and order and teach these
ignorant natives something of civiliza
tion.
The first serious work the Peace Com
mission undertook was the disarming
of both factions of the natives. With
this object in view, many people were
called and questioned in relation to the
exciting times of the past few months
and the best means of accomplishing
t'n/dis^rmv.'.'vvit. JjKluded 'ntM.s *i-ia.-*s.j
of testimony have been that of the* Con
suls, the commanders of the warships. I
tHe Chief Justice and many private
citizens. The Commission did not put
any of these people under oath, nor did
it bring a stenographer to report the
testimony, hence no accurate record of
it, if, in fact, any record at all, has
been kept. It may, therefore, be as
sumed that the reports of the three
Commissioners may differ materially
and each 'will probably be colored to
suit the desires of the Commissioner
presenting it.
' As to the disarmament question, Ma
taafa made it an easy matter as far as
his army was concerned. His letter to
the Commission on its arrival assured
it of his desire for peace, and an an
swer was soon sent to him inviting him
to come on board the Badger on May
20, Accordingly, early on the morning
of May 20 a number of boats came down

the coast from Malic, the largest of
which contained Mataafa and his thir
teen cheifs and the others his guard.
In all of the boats there were probably
:.â¢''â¢ ruen, all unarmed. '',:.â  boat con
taining V.ataafu was profusely deco
rated with flowers and canopied with
branches of green foliage. As the boats
drew up alongside the Bad gevT escorted
by small boats containing .armed men
from the warships, they presented a
very pretty sight. The "' irrepressible
Captain Sturdee took occasion to dis
patch a letter to the Commission pro
testing against such a large number of
Mataafans coming into the harbor, but
the Commission evidently thought that
five warships could take care of a hand
ful of unarmed natives, so Sturdee's
protest was not seriously considered.
Mataafa' reception, on board the
Badger was in every way pleasant. The
old chief discussed at length with the
Commission the events of the past,
claimed that he had fought a purely
defensive war, that his people were
anxious for peace provided their rights
were not taken from them, and that he
would obey the laws laid down by the
High Commissioners. It was arranged
without difficulty for the Badger at an
early date to proceed to Malle and col
lect all of the guns and ammunition
there in the possession of the natives.
Mataafa was assured that there was no
King, but* that the Commission was
King until it decided upon the future
government of Samoa, at which time -it
would endeavor to do justice to all par
ties. With .this assurance Mataafa and
his chiefs, after shaking hands- cor
dially with, the Commissioners, re
entered their boat and were escorted
out of the harbor by the English and
Americans, whence they returned to
Malic. : / -â¢â  - '
In accordance with the agreement,
the Badger weighed anchor at sunrise
May 31 and steamed down to Malua, a
small village a few miles ' from Ma
taafa's stronghold. At this point Ma
taafa and his chiefs boarded the ship,
and after, a short conversation with the
Commission they signaled their fol
lowers on shore to come out with their
arms. In a few moments. several hun
dred-natives were alongside jabbering
and gesticulating very much like a lot
of Chinamen. Each of the thirteen
chiefs had his. district to account for.
and each received the guns of his oWn
men through the side of the ship,
stacked them in a pile and received a
receipt for them. In all there were 1826
guns turned over at this time, but after
the Badger returned to Apia five more
were sent on board, making a total of
IS3I guns received from the Mataafans
the first day. Since that time 42 more
have been surrendered by the Mataafa
people, swelling the total to 1873. Of
this number 1292 are old Snider rifles,
241 Remington, SO needle carbines, 56
Winchesters, 46 Marlins. 34 Martini-
Henry, 27 Mausers and 27 Springfields.
The rest are made"' up of more than ; a
dozen obscure patterns, excepting two
United | States navy . rifles which - were
captured- at the battle ( of - Vailele .on
April 1. S.V-- ;' . '
. After the disarming of these men had
been accomplished Mataafa and his
thirteen high chiefs were invited ; down
into the mess room of the Badger,
where a lunch was spread for them.
Well informed people think that not
over half of Mataafa's guns were, se
cured, and 5 that the balance of them
are secreted somewhere- on the island,
but the Commission thinks T that by
making it a penal offense "with a heavy
punishment .for a native to jbe seen
with a, gun i In. his hands, all 'of them
.will ultimately be secured.: â¢
The Tanu J men i had, it- is estimated,
about 2500 guns, 700 of which were sup
plied recently by the English warships.
I
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
The programme was to collect these
guns on the same afternoon that the
Mataafa guns wefe secured, but the
Tanu people were not so willing *a p*-*

however, they began to, turn them in
about midnight at the, English guard
house at Mulirruu, and for several hours
until daylight there was incessant fif
ing poing on. starting rumor after
rumor down around Apia of an out
break. The men, however, were merely
firing off all of their cartridges into the
air before giving up their highly prized
weapons. By noon 1200 of their own
guns had been surrendered by the Ta
nus, and up to date they have surren
dered in round numbers 1369. The 700
English guns have also been returned
to the ships.
On the afternoon of June 1 a procla
mation was issued, printed in both Sa
moan and English, and signed by. the
three Commissioners, giving notice that
nil arms and ammunition still in the
hands of natives must be delivered to
the Commission before June 20, that re
ceipts would be given for all arms and
ammunition so received, and that the
same will be returned to their owners
after the restoration of peace, or full
compensation made therefor; but that
all arms and ammunition remaining in
the possession of the natives after June
20 will be confiscated and the person
in whose possession the same may be
found will be punished . by a fine not
exceeding $100 or by Imprisonment not
exceeding thirty days, or both such fine
and' imprisonment".
On June 2 large crowds of natives
from the islands of Tutuila and Savail
were returned to their homes by the
warships, and the' next day Mataafa
and' a few of his relatives and chiefs
embarked in their own boats for Au
maiie, on the coast some twenty miles
east of Apia. The natives being well
scattered and presumably unarmed, the
â few marines and sailors then remaining
on shore "were ''withdrawn- to their re
spective ships and the work of estab
lishing a civil government was begun.
,The first step was. an attempt to
organize a municipal council, but there
' were found to be difficulties in the way.
Apia comprises two municipal districts,
each of which elects three councilmen,
the President and three members mak
ing a quorum. Previous to the war an
election was called in the eastern dis
trict and two tickets were put in the
field. The returning officer, however,
a colonial, who made out the official
list of candidates, neglected to give the
full names of the anti-Tanu candidates,
but merely gave the initials and last
names. The Chief Justice, is openly
charged with having been aware of this
fact, if not indeed responsible, for it.
However this may be, the law com
pelling the full names of candidates to
be given, not having been complied
with, the Chief Justice decided the
Tanu candidates were elected, there be
ing no opposing ticket. After the war
began orre of these men left the country
temporarily, leaving but two council
men in the district. The councilmen in
the western district refused to sit with
these two men, alleging that. they were
fraudulently put in -office,, and Dr. Solf.
the newly appointed President, with all
his persuasive powers, is unable to se
cure a quotum. The only way out of
the dilemma, then, is to elect men in
the western district who will sit, and
the Commission.- in pursuance of this
plan has ordered an election in . that
district Ito take place on June 22.
As predicted in special cablegrams to
The Call, sent from here June 1 via
Auckland, the Commission has , abol
ished the kingship of Samoa, and has
deprived young Tanu of all authority
over the Samoan Government. It Is not
known what j sort â of a government will2
be established for th* Samosns; that is
what the Commissioners arc now think
ing about. All requests Cor enlighten
rpcmt on this subject are met with the
reply that they have the matter under
/ consideration and are working slowly
at it. It Is thought, ho we ver, that the
future native government will contem- i
plate their being separated Into dis
tricts, each district being ruled over by
its chief, and all of the districts being
under the control of the three powers.
It Is pretty well settled that the three
Consuls and the Chief Justice will be
recalled. British Consul Maxse and
German Consul Rose leave here on the
Mariposa to-day for San Francisco, the
former en route to London and the lat
ter to Berlin. It is announced that they
are Ing upon furloughs, but no one
here expects either of them to return,
If indeed; they do themselves. Within
the past few days Chief Justice Cham
bers is said to have become greatly in j
need of a rest, and he, too, will prob
ably seek a more congenial clime for ,
relaxation from his hitherto arduous !
duties, as soon as matters relating to

treaty dees not contemplate any
appeal from the decision of the
Chief Justice, provided he has
acted within his jurisdiction.
His is a court from which there
Is no appeal, and as soon as it
is proved that he has acted
within his jurisdiction his judg
ment is final and binding upon
the powers as well as upon the
Samoan Government. F' cc any
question as to whethÂ« Cham
bers' decision was in conformity
with the general act or with the
laws and customs of Samoa, or,
in fact, was leased upon any
fundamental truth whatever, is
m.-rely a matter for him to set
tle with his own conscience.
Before making public Its decision,
however, the Commission dethroned
Tanu and divested him of/all authority
over the Samoan Government, . hence
while the Supreme Court; was able to
create a King it was not- able to pre
vent his removal, and the reign of
Tanu, the last of the Samoan Kings,
passes into history as the shortest and
one of the stormiest of any monarch
that ever ruled over Samoa.
The Samoans on the peninsula of
Mulinuu, however, do not seem to un
derstand that they are not still the
Government. They have a v?eue idea
that although there is no longer a King,
Tanu and his chiefs are still the rulers.
The same New Zealanders that have
ever been prominent since the election
.if Mataafa are still influencing these
Tanu men to disorder, and the latter
are growing bolder and bolder every
day. The little settlement on Mulinuu
is the property of the Samoan Govern
ment, and is the seat of that Govern
ment, but notwithstanding this there
are nearly 1000 Tanu men there, includ
ing all of their chiefs and the ex-King,
although they have no more right th' -re
according to the Samoan custom than
have Mataafa and his people.
Dr. Solf, the new President, has Had
the first experience with these men
since the proclamation was issued. At
the eastern end of Mulinuu is the Presi
dent's official residence, which has been
occupied by an English guard up to a
week ago. After the house was vacated
Dr. Solf went over to Mulinuu to see
about having his residence put in order,
but he found Tamas'-se and some other
chiefs in possession. Solf told Tama
sese he had come to see about occupy
ing his house, but Tamasese replied
that he couldn't give his consent until
he had consulted Tanu. The doctor,
who has acted with careful discretion
since his arrival here, did not further
press the subject, but he has sent a
communication to the Commission ask
ing that these people be dispersed and.
sent away from Mulinuu without fur
ther delay. Chairman Tripp, on being
asked the reason why they have not
been dispersed the same as the other
natives, replied that it was on account
of Tamasese's illness. This chief, how
ever, has been looking extremely well of
late and has been seen on the streets
daily consulting with his white advis
ers; so there are many who think the
Commission will ultimately have to use
force to dispossess these men of what
does not belong to them.
The continued presence of the Tanus
on Mulinuu has also stirred the Mataafa
people up considerably. Three Mataafa
chiefs came in a few days ago and vis
ited the Badger to protest against the
Tanu people being permitted to remain
on the Government property, making a
pretense of carrying on a Government. I
They were promised that the Tanus
would soon be dispersed. There is no
doubt that there is a deep sense of in
justice still rankling in the breasts of
these people over the recent bunko
game played .on Mataafa. by the Su
preme Court. They solemnly declare
they will not recognize this tribunal in
any way as long as Justice Chambers
presides over it. They do not like the
wording of the proclamation continuing i
Justice Chambers in office, and if the
Peace Commission does not wish to
have its name prove a misnomer it will j
have to act instead of promise and pro
crastinate. It would certainly take but j
a spark to cause a conflagration at the
present time.
It has leaked out through reliable
sources that the. relations between Ad
miral Kautz and 'Consul Osborn be- â 
came very much strained before the
admiral's departure for San Francisco.
The differences began almost imme
diately after the admiral's arrival at
Apia. Consul Osborn's friends claim
that Admiral Kautz came here imbued
with the idea that the only way to set-
I tie the Samoan difficulty was to con-
I quer the Sarhoans. Consul Osborn was
of the opinion that useless slaughter
and possible international complica
tions should be avoided, that the
powers, having the settlement of the
troubles under consideration, a bom
bardment could accomplish no good re
sult, and It would destroy a vast
amount of property and probably cost
many human lives. The Mataafans
were not committing any breaches of
the peace at that time, but were main
taining order. They had been recog

nlzed as the Provisional Government
by the three Consuls, were preserving
order among the natives and had ex
pressed their willingness to do so pend
ing the settlement of their troubles by
the powers. Admiral Kautz, however,
did not take this view, and this differ
ence of opinion led to very bitter feel
ing between the two, which became
intensified to a marked degree when
the admiral began to Ignore the Amer
ican and confer with the British com
manders instead.
After several conferences between
the admiral, Captain Sturdee of the
Porpoise and the commander of the
Royalist, in which British Consul
Maxse, who has the credit of being the
disturbing element here, usually took
part, a letter was sent to Mataafa on
March 15, (ailing upon him to dis
perse his men or bombardment would
be commenced at 1 p. m. that day. No
notice, however, was given to the pub
lic, not even to the Consuls, and the at
tack when it came created a veritable
panic on shore.
On receipt of the admiral's letter
Mataafa, it is claimed, at once pre
pared to withdraw farther down the
coast, but after several of his boats had
put out to sea some distance to the
west of Apia, the warships opened fire
on them, the Philadelphia leading off.
The Porpoise immediately followed. In
explanation of this Anglo-British alli
ance, the naval men said that the
Mataafa party were coming to attack
Mulinuu, but appearances . indicate
that they were going in an opposite di
rection. The Mataafans say that they
were withdrawing down the western
coast in compliance with the admiral's
letter, and this would seem most likely,
as no one can seriously claim that
half a dozen rowboats full of natives
would attack three warships and a
thousand or more armed men on shore
with machine guns. None of the na
tive boats were struck at this time, and
the natives quickly put In to shore and
vanished into the thick bush. The
boats, however, were destroyed by the
warships soon after they were aban
doned.
But the victory was not complete.
Down at the east end of the harbor a
guard was stationed at the American
Consulate. The American .Consul did
not want a guard, being on friendly
terms with all of the natives, but he
was protected in spite of himself.
When the firing commenced eight or
ten Mataafa men started down the road
from the east toward the Consulate to
inquire what all of the noise was about.
Consul Osborn says they were friends
of his, were not fighting men and he
was preparing to receive them, hav
ing seen them at a distance coming
toward the Consulate. The Philadel
phia's gunners also saw them, and at
once shot and shell were whistling dan
gerously near to the Consul's residence.
One shell exploded just behind the
building and came very near wrecking
If and killing everybody inside of it.
The rear veranda, on which the Con
sul and his family take their meals and
which they had left but a short. time
before, was literally torn to pieces,' the
outbuildings were riddled with frag
ments of shell and Private Mudge of
the" United States marines, who was
stationed in the Consulate yard, was so
severely wounded that he died a few
days afterward. And right here it may
be stated as a somewhat curious fact
that several hundred shells were hurled
around among the frightened people of
Apia during the war and this marine
was. the only person killed by any of
them. Not a Mataafa man was hit.
The firing continued, and the shells
coming dangerously near to the Con
sulate, Osborn procured a boat and got
hie family out of danger, though they
all had narrow escapes. Consul Osborn
also assisted in getting the wounded
marine off to one of the ships, as he
was fast bleeding to death. The na
tives, of course, scampered back into
the bush as soon as they saw that they
were being fired at. None of them
fired a shot, and the sensational ac
counts published at the time that these
men were about to 'attack the Amer
ican Consulate are pronounced here to
be ridiculous.
The efforts of Consul Osborn seem to
have been directed toward a peaceful
settlement of the troubles long before
Admiral Kautz arrived . here. Before
Judge Chambers rendered . his famous
protocol decision in the kingship case,
a proclamation was taken to Osborn by
Chambers, Sturdee" and Maxse, which
they had prepared for his indorsement,
but Osborn refused to sign it, claiming
that It was intended to precipitate a j
war, and would undoubtedly do so if Is
sued. There was a very spirited argu- j
ment had at this time over the procla- ;
mation and the issues at stake. â  The
Englishmen were anxious to fight, and [
Lieutenant Cave of the Porpoise con
temptuously remarked that he could
take twenty English bluejackets and |
conquer the whole rebel force â Â» in j
twenty-four hours. Osborn told him lie \
couldn't take two thousand English
bluejackets and conquer them in
twenty-four weeks. Subsequent events
have proved that Osborn knew what he
was talking about, and Cave, too, must
realize something of this since his
frantic flight through the swamp at
Vailele on April 1, at the head of over
one hundred sailors and marines, pur
sued by less than one-quarter of the
rebel force.
Will Jam Cooper, an attorney from
Auckland, New Zealand, arrived 'here

after Mntaafn's Interests, and will con

BARON STERNBURG DOES
NOT BLAME ROSE
One More False Statement With
Regard to Samoa Is Put
Aside.
By W. E. Williamson.
The usual misrepresentations of af- <
| fairs at Samoa were again in evidence !
' in the reports received here this morn- j
ing from an unreliable Associated Press
j correspondent at Apia and published
in. the evening papers. One of these J
misstatements is to the effect that i
Baron Sternburg, the German Commis
sioner, had become fully convinced that |
; Hen? Rose, the German Consul, had j
acted wrongfully and was responsible
for the late outbreak at Samoa. Hay-
I ing myself arrived this morning from
Apia on the same- steamer with Consul
; Lose, and knowing full well the very
I friendly relations existing between him
| and Baron Sternburg, I called this
' evening on Consul Rose at the Palace
j Hotel and asked him if he desired to |
I say anything for publication. Consul
Rose expressed astonishment and re- j
gret that such falsehoods had been cir- ;
i culated.
"The statement," he said, â¢ "that
Baron Sternburg is fully convinced that
j I acted wrongfully and am responsible
' for the late outbreak in Samoa is abso
j lutely false. I have every reason to be- L
I lieve that Baron Sternburg knows very
| well that it was ptÂ»t my action that j
| caused the late troubles in Samoa, but
that they were due to other reasons, of
which I do not feel at liberty to speak, i
j Besides. Baron Sternburg is too able a
diplomatist and has too much discre
tion to make such a statement, even if
': he did think so."
Consul Rose was asked if he wished
to say anything in reply to the state- j
ment published in an evening paper
that he was snubbed by the passengers
on the steamer Mariposa, and he re
plied that the statement was too ridicu
'â  lous to require any attention from him.
The fact is that Rose's relations with
the passengers on the Mariposa were
most cordial. I was much in his com
pany and will vouch for this fact.
THERE IS A PROMISE
OF MUCH LITIGATION
WOODLAND, June 30.â 1n The Call of
to-day mention Is made of an investiga
tion put on foot by the attorneys and
managers of the Moore ditch property to
ascertain why the water is at such a low
Stage so early in the season. As a result
of their investigations there is likely to
be long and expensive litigation. In ! v mi
the Spring Valley Water Company con
structed a ditch beginning at the head of
Capay Valley. After fifteen miles of
ditch had been constructed work was
stopped by an Injunction obtained by the
Moore Ditch Company. This ditch has
not since been used until this year. Sev
eral Capay Valley farmers and fruit
growers recently obtained permission Of
the Spring. Valley Company to use the
ditch. They constructed a dam which
turned about eight feet of water from
Cache Creek into the ditch. It was also
discovered that a dam which will divert
about eight feet of water from the creek
is in course of construction near Capay.
This Is intended to supply the Adams
ditch which was constructed several
years ago. There has been much litiga
tion between the projectors of this ditch
and the Moore Ditch Company.
All of the facts and alleged rights in
volved in the controversy were once sub
mitted to Judge Beatty, who was chosen
by stipulation to arbitrate, but he has
never rendered a decision. All parties
were served with a notice to desist.
FOUGHT A DUEL OVER
A COW'S CARCASS
STOCKTON. June 30. â Information
reached the Police Office this afternoon
of a bloody encounter between two Mexi
cans yesterday near the eastern limits
of the* city. A cow fell into Miner Chan
nel basin and was killed. Two Mexicans
purchased the carcass and started in to
cut it up. They worked amicably for a
time, but had some words and began
fighting which was kept up for some time
in a rough-and-tumble manner. They
took a recess and. after more work, re
sumed the fight for blood. The older
Mexican who had got the worst of the
first encounter, picked up an ax, while
the younger one made a lunge at him with
a butcher-knife. A duel followed. The
younger man made rapid passes at his
antagonist with the knife, but finally the
ax descended upon him. The knife fell
from his hand, which hung from the wrist
as if ready to drop. A spectator at a dis
tance says both men were covered with
bload. As soon as the older man saw the
injury. he had Inflicted he turned and ran
and the other hastily left the scene. Both
men were evidently cared for by friends,
who hushed the matter up and prevented
any complaints being sworn to. -z %:"â¢â - â -:.

â
Special Dispatch to The fall.
LOS ANGELES, June 30.â H. P. Tay
lor, trustee of the California Auto-
Truck Company, who arrived here this
morning, devoted the day to an ex
amination of the local field, with a view
to establishing a compressed air plant.
Taylor says he is confident that even
tually autotruck and automobile will
supersede the street car system. at pres
ent operating in Los Angeles. He is on
his way to San Francisco to establish
an automobile plant and service to
compete with the Market-street line
to the Oakland ferry. His company will
charge but 3 cents fare. When asked
what were the chances for an auto
; truck and automobile service in Los
' Angeles Mr. Taylor said that the com
pany would come here soon and it de
| pends upon the enterprise of the citi
zens whether Los Angeles Or San Fran
cisco will be chosen as headquarters.
"The situation is simply this," said
Mr. Taylor. : "I will leave to-night or
to-morrow for San Francisco. Superin
tendent George A. .Russell: and Chief
Engineer Robert- Vogelsang probably
arrive,) in San Francisco to-day. I am
to meet them there and will later come
to Los Angeles. Lam agreeably im
pressed with this city. It is larger than
I thought. The plant we will build here
will coat $50,000. A number of business
men are interested in seeing a practical
demonstration made here. We will later
give this.
"We do not wish to compete at pres
ent with the street car lines. If we did
we would immediately have a great
fight on our hands. Our autotrucks
I will carry tremendous weights. When
! these demonstrate what can be done
i with compressed air, we will introduce
| the automobile for passenger service.
| The International Power Company has
I among its directors Richard Croker, Joe
Letter, Nathan Strauss, Senator Gor
! man and J. H. Hoadley. Its capital is
' about $30,000,000. The California Auto
; Truck Company, incorporated under the
; laws of New Jersey with a capital, of
j $5,000,000. is a branch of the Inter
| national.
"Our idea is to have Los Angeles
! capitalists take 1 per cent of the pre
i ferred stock, and in return we will give
I them the management of this city's
i plant and system. As 1 per cent is equal
j to 500 shares, it would be necessary- for
i Los Angeles to buy $50,000 in preferred
stock.
"We also will put plants and establish
systems in San Francisco, San Jose,
Sacramento and Stockton, if the outlook
is favorable. Everybody knows com
pressed air is the coming power. Our
automobiles operate on Fifth avenue,
New York, to-day. Passengers are taken
right up to the curb instead of being
landed in the middle of streets. Our
factories now cover sixteen acres and
we employ 5000 men. Each autotruck
can carry ten tons of freight."
MODUS VIVENDI MAY
SOON BE SIGNED
WASHINGTON, June 30. âIt is the
expectation of the authorities that the
modus Vivendi establishing a tempor
ary boundary line between Alaska and
Canada will be signed within the next
few days. Conferences which have
been held by Embassador Choate with
the British Foreign Office officials,
while they have not resulted in an
agreement, have shown the practicabil
ity of a settlement of the controversy,
and confidence is expressed that the
matter will be determined very soon.
The present discussion is confined to
the location of the line on Dalton trail,
the United States being desirous of
placing it just north of Kluckwan,
while the British Government is
anxious that it should be fixed south
of that point. As Great Britain has
given up her claims to a port on Lynn
canal, the proposition is a distinct gain
for the United States. -"-'*â 'â .;'.:
This Government would be willing to
make a concession to Great Britain on
this point were it not for the fact that
a large number of American miners are
located in the territory desired by the
British, and it is said it would be very
embarrassing to both Governments if
Groat Britain should be given control
of the territory. .
. It is expected that the British Gov
ernment will ultimately be willing to
adopt the line proposed by Embassa
dor Choate.

It was the grandest affair ever wit

was spread for a distance of about three

trousseau, ordered from Sydney, was most
elaborate. Her wedding dress of white
satin was trimmed with Honiton tape, tin

length, was composed of slrVer and white
heavy brocade. It was upheld by six
bridesmaids, dressed in white silk (made

As a resident of Tonga for the past
three years will you permit me. in jus
tice to the parties concerned, to refute
most emphatically a scurrilous article
published in a late issue of a paper and
dated Victoria. B. C. April 20. The ar
ticle in question is one tissue of fabrica
tions from beginning to end. This gov
ernment does not owe money. Salaries
are paid quarterly and there is generally
a balance in the treasury. But last year
and the previous one being very dry, not
much copra was made and salaries were
delayed one quarter. Secondâ One arti
cle of the Tongan law is that no trader
can trust a native, as the latter can not
be sued, so If a trader gives him credit
he does so at his own risk. A number of
German traders did give credit, and then
sent for their Consul to come and have
this law repealed, but the government
refused to grant his request and he re
turned to Samoa. Satekl, the Premier,
wished to resign on account of ill health
and advanced age. but the King requested
him to remain in office and he did so.
The names given by the writer of the
two young chieftesses proves that he has
been made a fool of by his informant.
King George receives (8000 per year and
as he also has a revenue from the thou
sands of cocoanut trees on his lands, the
copra of which brings $55 a ton, It gives
evidence that he can purchase what he
wishes and pay for it as well.
The royal yacht is where it has been
for months pastâ lying at anchor in front
of the Palace. Such articles are scur
rilous in the extreme, throwing ridicule

of miners reached. Dawson for provi
sions, bringing 1< tiers and news of such
rich strikes that people of -Dawson
went wild with excitement, and two
days later thousands were on their way

and started for Nome. . The Seattle and
another steamer soon' followed. All

wharves was a wild and exciting one.
It was just like the departures of the
big vessels from San Francisco during
the rush of 1597.

hundreds who piled their outfits on

anything that would floatâ and drifted
down the Yukon to the new- gold fields.
Jt was a mad stampede, the most ex
citing that lias yet occurred in the his
tory of the Klondike.
Dawson papers say it was the most
excited stampede since that memorable
rush of 1896 from Fort Yukon. Circle
and adjacent diggings to rich Bonanza
and the Klondike.
That the new districts are richer than
any placers yet discovered in the north
is shown by the tone of the letters from
It he liners now there to their friends
at Dawson. Letters from a miner to
a miner always give the most reliable
news of gold discoveries, and on receiv

Dawsonians sold their business and
Joined the mad rush. The text of
nearly all the letters in a nutshell was.
â¢â¢Sell out and come at once; the dig
gings are the richest ever found." The
majority of those who received letters,
together with their friends, did so and
swelled the ranks of the stampeders.
The letters and the miners from Nome
told of pans taken from the rich tribu
taries of Snake River, ranging in value
from $20 to $30. Four men who were at
work on Anvil Creek took out $2200 in
three days. Others working on Snow
Creek panned out $1500 in two days.
One man who has a claim on Califor
nia Creek found a nugget during Feb
ruary worth $142.
The rich find;- reported from the dis
tricts are said to have been made on
the tributaries of the Snake River,
which enters the Arctic Sea at Nome
City, some miles north of Cape Nome.
Anvil Creek, which falls from the
Anvil Mountains, about thirty miles
from its mouth, Is giving fabulously
rich pans.
The first tragedy in the district is re
ported by the miners who have reached
Dawson. They tell of a robbery and
murder and the subsequent capture
and lynching of the murderer. Early
in March, some say the 2d, and some
the 4th, the cabin of George Barrow on
Sunset Creek, a feeder of the Snake
River was entered, Barrow was mur
dered and about $3000 in gold, which' he
had in the cabin, was stolen. Barrow
not going out to work as usual, the
other miners went down to his shack
to see if he was sick. To their sur
prise and horror they found the unfor
tunate miner laying on the floor of the
cabin with blood streaming from a
gaping wound in his throat. A blood
stained razor lying near by showed
how the murder had been committed.
The murderer had cut the throat of his
victim, stolen the money and fled.
The miners gathered at the cabin and
were not long in organizing a searching
party to look for the murderer. An
hour after the discovery of the body
eleven men were on the murderer's
trail, and three hours later he was cap
tured while on his way down the Snake
River with the stolen gold in his posses
sion. When confronted with the evidences
of his crime he confessed. A rope was
stretched over a nearby tree and within
four hours after the discovery of the
murder, the murdererâ a German who
went into the Cape Nome district from
the Koyakuk district â was executed by
he enraged miners.

CYCLONE AND
FLOOD IN TEXAS
Miles of Fertile Country
Devastated.
Special Dispatch to Tl ! Call.
AUSTIN, June 30.â The terrific rains
in Central Texas contii J*- unabated !
and the floods in the creeks and rivers j
are devastating growing crops and
other property with increased vora- j
ciousness. Railroad traffic on almost
every trunk line in the State is para
lyzed and the damage to the Interna
tional and Great North m, the Hous- j
ton and Texas Central, the Missouri,
Kansas and Texas, the San Antonio j
and Aransas Pass and- the Gulf,
Colorado and Santa F< roads by the
washing away of brides and many
miles of track will aggregate over half â 
a million dollars.
This section of thÂ© State has been
completely shut off from railway com- j
munication with the North and East
for the past two days and no mail
from St. Louis, Cniea.;o, New York j
and other Northern an! Eastern points j
has been received since traffic was first
interrupted: The Brazos River Is the
largest of the flooded streams. At |
points its width Is ten miles and It con
tinues to rise slowly below Hearne. its
tributaries are all out of their banks |
and scores of costly county bridges
have been washed away. The Brazos
River bottom lands from Hearne to
Velasco are known as the most produc
tive cotton region In the South. It is i
really the cotton belt of Texas.
The present unprecedented high wa
ter has swept one hundred thousand
prospective bales of cotton out of exist
ence. This is a conservative estimate
of trie extent of the loss of the cotton
yield. In addition to the cotton crop
loss the sugar planters in the lower
counties along the course of the Brazos
are suffering great damage to their
sugar cane crops.
H. M Troxow, a prominent planter
of Washington- County, who arrived
here to-day from the scene of the flood
in that section, estimates the total <
losses to crops in the bottoms of the
Brazos and tributaries will be fully
two million dollars and if the rise be
comes a few feet greater the loss will
reach an additional million dollars.
In Washington and adjoining coun- j
ties there are many well-to-do negro
planters whose possessions are entirely
swept away. The negroes are
heavy sufferers from the floods. In j
Bell County Leon and Nolan creeks are
raging torrents of- water and have j
washed away many houses and house
hold effects, besides destroying all crops ;
in their course. ' All telephone messages j
received this evening from Beltc-n state
that a number of small residences,
there have been swept away by Nolan |
Creek, but no losÂ« of life is reported. j
The flood has also done considerable
damage at Bryan.
In addition to the floods a destructive
cyclone passed through Milam County-
Wednesday afternoon. The path of the
storm was about 200 feet wide and !
everything in its way was destroyed. I
A number of people were badly cut and
bruised, but none were fatally injured.
News of the cyclone was received here
to-day by telephone and full particulars
are lacking.
The Colorado River is also on another
big rise below here and in Fayette
County it is out of its banks and doing
much damage. State Senator A. B.
Davidson of Cuero arrived here this
evening. He stated that the Guada- j
loupe and Colorado rivers in that sec
tion are flooding the low country. The j
rains in that locality during the past |
few days have been terrific. The fall
was 8.8 inches in eighteen hours.
The Gulf. West Texas and Pacific and
the New York, Texas and Mexican
railroads are literally washed to pieces.
The track of the latter road from Vic
toria to Richmond, a distance of eighty
miles, is nearly all under water. The
San Antonio- and Aransas Pass road ;
from Cuero to Wallace, a distance of
100 miles, is also badly washed.

liams while in the custody of the officers
of Harrison County?- The guilt or inno- I
cence of the prisoner of the crime with !
which he was charged ought not be now i
considered. The sole question is that he
was a defenseless prisoner in the custody
of the officers of the law and. entitled to ;
the protection of the law. I have, there
fore, to request that you will immediately
and fully advise me concerning that oc
currence, and I beg to assure you in the
most positive terms that whatever aslst

WILL STUDY FISH
OF TIFF SLOPE
Expedition Leaves Stan
ford To-Day.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY! June 30.â
An important expedition, under direction
of the United States Fish Commission,
will leave Stanford University to-morrow
to explore the rivers of Oregon and to
study and collect the fishes found there.
The expedition will be under the direction
of Professor Charles H. Gilbert, head of
the zoology department at Stanford, and
John O. Snyder, Instructor in zoology, who
will have personal charge. J. S. Burcham.
VV F. Allen and F. < '. Robinson, all Stan
ford students, will Hake up the party.
The plan of the work as outlined by Dr.
Gilbert in an interview is as follows: the
party will start from Stanford and will
drive over the entire region. It will be
provided with the latest collecting appar
atus, lines, nets and trawls, and will bo
prepared to camp out the entire time.
The scientists will drive up the Sacra
mento Valley, skirting the mountains on
the west side, and over the Siskiyou
Mountains into Oregon. Collections will
be made on all points on the route, but
In Oregon the real work will commence,
and. a careful exploration of the streams
and rivers from the north of < allforn a
up. into Washington to the Columbia
RrYer will be made. â¢ â¢ ,
The party will work up the coast and
return through the interior of the State.
All the fish will be studied, but particu
lar attention will he paid to the import
ant food fish, the trout and the salmon,
that abound in that region. The party
expects to be gone about two or three
months. , .
The expedition is under the auspices
of the United States Fish Commission
and Is part of the system of making a
thorough exploration of the Pacific
Coast streams and a classification and
study of their fishes, which has been in
trusted to Dr. Gilbert. The commence
ment of this work is due to Dr. Gilbert.
His scientific work in the. Middle West
attracted the attention of the authorities
and he was sent to explore Yellowstone
Park The Fish Commission decided to
have him continue with his work on the
Pacific Coast, and the region so far ex
amined extends from Mexico to the Ore
gon border, the California portion being
completed in 1897. The result has been
that Dr. Gilbert now stands next to Dr.
Jordan as the highest authority on fishes
on the coast.
Dr. Gilbert intends to supervise the
work thoroughly. He will not be with
the expedition personally at all times, but
will go up the coast and meet It at various
points, so that he can keep in touch with
it and direct the investigations. The ex
pedition will be directly- under the charge
of John O. Snyder, who is instructor of
zoology and curator of the zoological mu
suem at Stanford. He is well prepared to
conduct the expedition successfully, for
he has done considerable work along this
line, particularly in Mexico, where last
winter he made an extensive collection of
the fishes of the Gulf of Mexico under the
direction of Dr. Jordan.
The specimens obtained this summer
will be transmitted to. the United States
National Museum at Washington and a
duplicate set will be sent to the Stanford
museum. ____________ _
RENOUNCE THEIR CLAIM
TO COBURG SUCCESSION
Duke of Connaught and His Son Re-
tire in Favor of the Duke
â¢ of Albany.
COBURG, June 30.â 1t was officially
announced to-day that the Duke of
Connaught, brother of the reigning
Duke Of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. and
the son of the Duke of Connaught,
Prince Arthur, have renounced their
claims to the Coburg succession in fa
vor of the Duke of Albany, son of the
late Prince Leopold of England. The
Duke of Albany, who was born in 1881,
and whose mother was Princess Helena
â of Waldeck, will be heir to the throne
of Coburg under the guardianship of
Prince Hohenlohe-Taigenburg.
-The Duke of Connaught reserves the
right to the succession in the event of
the death of the Duke of Albany or the
extinction of the latter's male line. The
Duke of Albany will immediately come
to Coburg and receive a German edu
cation previous- to entering the Ger
man army.
The Minister of State in Chief. C. F.
yon Strenge, informed the Diet that the
Duke of Connaught's reason for the
renunciation of the succession was
his unwillingness to part from his only
son and because he could not abandon
his responsibility for the care and edu
cation of his son while Prince Arthur of
Connaught was compelled to reside in
England, and the Duke recognized that
the heir to the. throne of Coburg re
quired German education. The Queen
and the royal family, he added, all had
tho most tender love for Coburg, to
which they were joined through the
Prince Consort. 7 -:;

An Interesting Report of
Commissioners.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. June 30.â Code Com
missioners A. Caminetti, R. H. Bulla
and T. W. H. Shanahan to-day filed
their report with the Governor as fol
lows:
"Office of the Commissioners for the
Revision and Reform of Law, Sac
' ramento. Cal., June 30, 1899.
"To' Hon. Henry T. Gage, Governor of
California: We respecffully report
that we have this day filed with the
Hon. Charles F. Curry, Secretary of
State, an additional partial report of
the commission for the revision and re
form of law, said report consisting of
the revised Political cod? fully com
pleted and ready for printing.
â¢This volume was practically com
pleted several months ago, and would
have been duly filed as re
quired by law had it not
been for the inability of the State
Printing Office to print the san^ dur
ing the late session of the Legislature.
Such being the fact, the Commissioners
deemed It advisable to withhold the fil
ing thereof in order that such statutes
and amendments, adopted at said ses
sion, as properly belonged in the
Political Code, might be -incorporated
therein.
"This purpose involved the rear
rangement to some extent and the re
writing of a very considerable portion
of the work of revision already per
formed. The labor has now been fin
ished, and the result is embodied in
the report herein referred to.
"The remainder of the work of codifi
cation and revision is small compared
with that already accomplished. In
deed, the work of carrying into the
Political Code the statutes passed
since the adoption of the codes, which
statutes should have been originally
enacted as a part of the Political
Code, is far greater than that of a
similar nature connected with all the
other codes combined.
"The laws relating to municipal cor
porations, comprising numerous and
important statutes hitherto constitut
ing an unintelligible jumble, have been
codified and compose several hundred
pages of said report. The acts apper
taining to state officers. Commission
ers and public institutions, which have
been scattered through many volumes
of our statute law. have all been codi
fied and are incorporated in the Politi
cal Code.
"The county government act, and nu
merous other statutes relating to the
government of counties, have also been
svstemized and inserted therein, this
of itself requiring great expenditure of
time and labor. ; :â 'â â  â .
"A large portion of the Penal Code
has also been revised, and it was the
hope and intention of the commission
that it should have been entirely com
pleted and filed at this time, but pro
longed and fatal illness in the family
of one of the Commissioners, which
prevented his attendance at the meet
ings of the commission at which the
work of revision of said code was to
have been finally passed upon, has ren
dered this impossible."
"The revision of the Code of Civil
Procedure alone remains. It is the in
tention and purpose of the commission
to compile also a volume to be desig
nated the 'uncodified statutes,' to be
composed of statutes special or tempor
ary in their nature or ' otherwise not
proper to become a part of either of the
codes. , - . â _',
"A more detailed report, including a
description of the methods pursued and
the objects sought to be attained by the
commission will be subsequently filed
when the entire work is completed."

SAX JOSE, June 30.â Mrs. Emilie T.
Spring was to-day given a divorce from
11. M.' X. Spring by Judge Lorigan. The
ground on which th" decree was given
is adultery. Mrs.' Spring was given the
custody of the three childrenâ Jack, Mar
garet and Dorothyâ household furni
ture and $200 a month alimony. Ths court
held there was no community property,
but this will probably be brought up later
and Mrs. Spring will undoubtedly secure
! a goodly share. Spring's wealth is esti
mated at over $50,000. .v-:, ,
The case attracted great attention be-
I cause of the prominence of Mrs. Spring,
who was always one of â¢ the leaders of

Fights Among Italian
Deputies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. July I.â The Rome corre
spondent of the Daily Mail says: The
Chamber of Deputies to-day (Friday)
was transformed into a veritable bat
tlefield. The tumult was terrific.
More than twenty Deputies were in
; jured in the struggle, including Baron
â¢ Sonnino, who was seriously hurt.
Baron Sonnino is the leader of the ma
jority and the probable future Premier.
The Chamber will not be closed until
November.
ROME, June 30.â 1n the Chamber of
Deputies to-day the Socialists and
Extreme Leftists recommended their
; obstructive tactics and created an im-
â se uproar. j
A secret ballot having been ordered
on certain bills, the Socialists rushed
down to prevent it. Signor Sonnino ad
vanced first to register his vote, but
the Socialist Deputy, Signor Bissolati.
<jea.!t him a violent blow near the
temple. Signor Sonnino then seized
him by the throat and coat collar and
threw him down, receiving himself, in
the meantime, numerous blows from
the other Socialists who took part in
the affray.
While this tussle was in progress
hand-to-hand combats were waging ail
around, and the Conservatives, Signor
Santaini and Signor Bertolini, used
their fists upon the Socialists with
great effect. Signor Costa, Socialist,
: with his sleeves turned up, dealt blows

cried: "Beware of the murderer."
General Pelloux, pale and stupefied,
remained standing. He was on the
point of being attacked when Admiral
Bettelo raised a chair and defended
him. The galleries joined in the up
roar with wild cries and were cleared.
Signor Chinaglia, the President of
he Chamber, suspended the sitting.
When the combatants were separated
Signor Sonnino persuaded the Presi
lent to resume the proceedings, if only,
is he put it, "to afford incontestible
nroofs of Socialist violence."
The secret ballot was again called for
with the result that there was a repeti
tion of the disorder.

CATTLE WITH TICKS
NOW BARRED OUT
SAN DIEGO, June 30.â There will be no I
more importations of cattle Into this
country from Lower California, or proba
bly any other part of Mexico, until the |
repeal of a new law which was just made
public to-day. â  - '.â 
W. E. Hill, whose jurisdiction as a guar- !
tine inspector extends from the Rio i
Grande to the Pacific Ocean, to-day re
ceived Instructions from the Agricultural
Department at Washington to admit no
cattle with ticks from Mexico. As there j
is scarcely a bovine creature anywhere ,
in the southwest of Mexico that is not
more or less afflicted with harmless ticks
the new law amounts to the prohibition ,
of cattle from below the line. The rea
son advanced by Officer Hill for the new i
law is that ticks are believed to be a
means of bringing germs of fever into this
country. This, however, is considered the
merest nonsense by stockmen, who de
clare that Lower California is absolutely
free from cattle disease of any kind and
has been so from time immemorial. Some
of the best cattle sent to the markets of
Southern California come from the Mex
ico peninsula, the importations the pres
ent year reaching 2000 head.
E. E. Burns, a butcher of this city,
lately purchased a large band of cattle
on the peninsula, which now cannot be
brought across the line. Steps will he
taken by prominent citizens in Southern
California to secure, a repeal of the new
law, at least so far as it relates to Lower
California.
ARREST OF A DOCTOR
FOR STEALING A TRUNK
MARYSYILLE, June 30.â 0n informa
tion from Chief of Police Lees of San
Francisco, Sheriff Bevan to-day arrested
Henry B. Wilson in his office in the
Woodruff block in this city and booked
him at the County Jail on a charge of
grand larceny. Dr. Wilson, who located
in Marysville about a month ago. is
wanted in Chicago for. the theft of a
trunk, the contents of which is valued
at $560. On May 17 last he registered at
the Saratoga Hotel in Chicago as a resi
dent of the Presidio, Cal. He represented
that he was a physician on the battleship
Oregon, and through false pretenses he
secured possession of a trunk containing
clothing and jewelry of tne value stated,
the property of one John D. Temple, who
swore to the complaint. Chief of Detec
tives L. P. Collerar. of Chicago has wired
Sheriff Bevan to hold Wilson. He will
prepare papers and send an officer after
the prisoner. The trunk in question was
found by the Sheriff in Wilson's office,
and seme of the articles which were
scattered about the room have marks
that indicate they are Temple's property.
Wilson claims that he came into the
possession of the trunk through a mis
take made by a baggage-master, who
checked it after a washout on an Eastern
road was encountered. He says he has
written Several letters East In an - effort
to right the matter, but could get no re
ply Wilson has in his possession a let
ter from Colonel Theodore Roosevelt,
which shows that he was with the Rough
Riders at Santiago, being a physician in
the hospital corps. Since coming to
Marvsvilfe he has indulged in frequent
speeches and. acted queerly.

MAY BOYCOTT
SOUTHERN PACIFIC
Chicago Merchants Up
in Arms.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, June 30.â At a conference 1
between the wholesale merchants and ]
manufacturers of this ctiy and the rep
resentatives of the Western railroads to
day It was practically resolved to boy
cott the Southern Pacific and "Kansas j
City, Pittsburg and Gulf railroads unless
they increase the freight rates from New I
York to the Mississippi territory
and withdraw the demand for a differen- I
tia', of 15 per cent less than all rail rates
from New York to trans-Missouri River
territory. __ j
The low rates recently made from New
York by the Morgan and Mallory steam- I
ship lines, in connection with the South- j
crn Pacific and tthe Kansas City, Pitts- .
burs and Gulf railroads, are less than
the rates from Chicago to the same
poll west of the Missouri River, and j
consequently wholesale merchants and
manufacturers of Chicago, St. Louis and |
other Western cities are unable to com
pete in that territory. It is believed the
Southern Pacific Is responsible for the ,
rate discrimination against Chicago. It i
owns the Morgan steamship line from
New York to Gulf ports, and the Malory j
line Is forced to meet rates made by the i
Morgan line. In addition, the Southern
Pacific carries freight from the steamers
to the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf
Railroad, which gits but a pittance for !
carrying th freight on to Kansas. City j
and "intermediate paints on its line,
"The Southern Pacific has always j
worked against Chicago and I think it Is
time for us to return the complement, "
Faid a representative of one of the biggest i
mercantile houses of the city at the in- |
ference. "That railroad lias always de
manded that freight rates be as low
from New V rl as from Chicago to the i
Pacific Coast, and now it demands he j
right to make rates lower by 15 per cent
from New York to points west of the Mis- j
Bouri liiver than rates from Chicago. The
right thing for every merchant and man
ufacturer of Chicago and St. Louie to do I
is to send all California shipments by
way of the Santa Fe road, the only rival j
of the Southern Pacific, It is to the in
terest of the Santa Fe to advance the in
terests of Chicago; and we should in turn
Bid the Santa Fe."
Similar views were expressed by oth
ers, but it was finally decided to await
the result of the conference to be held
at New York next Thursday between
the traffic officials of Western railroads,
the Gulf, arid the Southern Pacific rail
roads and the Mallory and Morgan
steamship lines.
DEWEY IS STILL

Will Be Obliged to Take a Rest in
Europe Before Coming
Home.
NEW YORK. June 30.â A World cable
from London says: Admiral Dewey will
first land in Europe at Trieste, an Aus
trian port at the head of the Adriatic
Sea.
The World correspondent learns with )
deep regret from the highest authority |
that the admiral's health has shown no
appreciable improvement since he left
Manila, and acting under medical ad
vice, he will take a complete rest for
a time in the Austrian Tyrol before re
suming his journey home. His health
unfortunately bo far is so indifferent
that he could not safely face the fa
tigue of the reception awaiting him.

Uneasy in Transvaal.
Special dispatch to The CaH.
LONDON, July The Capetown
correspondent of the Daily Mail says: ;
"The Germans and Americans in the
Transvaal have applied to their Con
suls for marines to protect their prop
erty in the event of hostilities."
LONDON, June 30.â The Digger
News, the Boer organ in London, prints
a dispatch from Johannesburg to-day
announcing on reliable authority that
the Volksraad will be asked on Monday
to confirm an arrangement made by the
Executive Council acceptable to the
British High Commissioner. Sir Alfred
Milner, and the British Government.
It is believed the arrangement grants
a seven-year retrospective franchise to
Uitlanders, resident in the Transvaal
before 1880, who will be admitted to
burgership, and makes other modifica
tions in the naturalization laws.
GERMANY TO SUPPORT
AMERICA'S PLAN
Will Favor Appointment of a Per-
manent Arbitration
Tribunal.
NEW YORK, June 30.â World
cable to The Hague says: The World
correspondent has official authority for
stating that, owing to representations
mad,- in Berlin in behalf of the Ameri
can delegation "to the Peace Conference,
Germany has definitely decided to sup
port the American plan for a perma
nent arbitration tribunal.
The German Emperor was made
aware thai the limit of concessions had
been reached, and that the other powers
were so determined upon establishing
a permanent tribunal that it would be
instituted either with or without Ger
many's co-operation.
The gaining of the Kaiser's support
of the scheme Is regarded here as a
striking testimonial to the influence of
the American delegation.

Mountain View House in this city, met
with a -horrible accident last night. She.
and another girl were making their

girl seized the bottle, and, pouring
some of its contents In her right palm,
dashed the fluid 'on her face. Instead
of glycerine the bottle contained car- i
bolic acid, and in a moment the young
woman began screaming as it burned
into her flesh. Dr. T. L. Price applied ,
soothing lotions and reduced the ter
rible pains. The acid covered both j
cheeks and chin. The young woman '

she escapes disfigurement for life. '": j

ARE DREADING
AGUIRRE'S AX
Consternation at San
Quentin Prison.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. June 30.â
Twenty large Saratoga trunks have
caused almost as much dismay among
the guards and those officials whose
heads have not already . fallen under
Warden Aguirre's ax as would have re
sulted from the explosion of a bomb
shell, a baggage car filled with trunks
arrived at Greenbrae last evening and
several more came to-day, every one of
them being consigned to a person whoso
name was formerly unknown here.
Plainer than words is the evidence thus
furnished that Aguirre means to make
a clean sweep of the prison in the in
terest of Los Angeles and vicinity as
soon as he conveniently can.
The speculation as to who will go
next is lively, but the Warden will not
talk and the Board of Prison Directors
is nonplused. It is now definitely
known, despite ail denials, that Aguirre
has thrown down the gauntlet to the
Directors and intends utterly to ignore
them as regards appointments. That
he will in time find himself to have
been playing with a boomerang is
freely prophesied.
It was learned to-day - that ten or
twelve guards will be discharged within
a few days. They will mostly be men
whose positions require little expe
rience, such as the outside posts.
Too late has it been discovered that
the statements of Aguirre regarding a
conservative policy were used to mask
his real intentions, and while every kind
of "pull" is being exerted . it is now
deemed futile to do more than ; yield
gracefully. ".-â ; -~! :
Captain Edgar's fine wire pulling,
while due indirectly to the friendship
of Lieutenant Governor was really
made possible by the intervention of
W. F. Herrin of the Southern Pacific
Company. So potent a factor has
Herrin's Influence proved that not only,
has Edgar managed to hold his own po
sition, but to-day he had Aguirre ap
point Joseph Edgar, his son, guard.
A ludicrous incident is that several of
the guards have secured Spanish text
books and as fast as they master a
few phrases let no opportunity slip to
make use of their new knowledge where
they think it will do the most good.
To-morrow the new appointees will
take their positions and an exodus of
those who have been discharged will
occur. ',-

SPOKANE, June 30.â Charles Fryett, j
a young Wardner clerk, the only sup- j
port of a widowed mother, has been j
bound over by United States Commis
sioner H. P. Strong of Walla Walla on ]
a charge of interfering with the mails j
during the riots. Bail was fixed by the
Commissioner at $2000. Absolutely no j
testimony was given before the Com- â 
missioner to warrant the holding of j
Fryett. A stenographic report of the
hearing shows the following facts:
Postolfice Inspector Charles Bratton,
who signed the complaint, was the first
witness. Bratton testified that his
home is in Spokane, that he was not
at Wardner the day of the riots and did
not know whether Fryett was in Idaho
that day. Coroner " France, Acting
Sheriff at Wardner, was the only other
witness called. He swore he was in
Wardner the day of the riot, saw the
trains side-tracked and saw a crowd of
1200 men. The other questions to France
and his answers follow :"&"â¢â ; if.
"Did you see anything of the defend
ant there?" "No, sir, I did not."
"You did not see him there, that
day?" No."
"You had a talk with the defendant
this morning?" "Yes, sir."
"You told him that if he would go to
Idaho yen would sign papers to
release him, if he would become a wit
ness for the State' "I spoke to him
as having authority from the State. I
couldn't speak with any authority in
this Federal trial."
The defense objected to a general
question asking France if he could con
nect ETryett with obstructing the mails.
This objection was overruled, and
France said that while conducting the
inquest he heard testimony that Fryett
was seen to mingle with the crowd.
The Commissioner then announced
that he would bind the prisoner over
and fix his bond at $2000.
BURBIDGE TELLS HOW
HE LED THE RETREAT
WALLACE, Idaho, June 30.â The tak- j
ing of testimony in the action against
the County Commissioners was con
cluded to-day, and at the request of the '
court the case against the Sheriff was â 
immediately taken up. Judge Stewart j
expressed a desire to have all the cvi- j
dence in both cases, presented to him
before argument was begun in the Com
missioners* case.
The greater part of the afternoon ses
sion Was occupied with the testimony
of Frederick Burbidge, manager of the
Bunker Hill Company. His statements j
created a great deal of laughter, espe- j
cially when he told how he led the j
j forces of the company in making their !
retreat when it was learned that the j
i miners were coming from Canyon
I Creek. Burbidge said that when he j
I heard the train from Wallace was com- j
I ing he understood a moral suasion
' party was on board. He instructed his
i men to remain at. work and pay no at- j
tention to the suasionists. Soon after
' he received a telephone message to the I
effect that some of the men were ;
masked and armed. He then marshaled j
his men and ordered them to abandon
the company's property. He himself led
the way and made such rapid progress
I that he reached Kingston, seven miles
j away, in about an hour. The company
i had a number of rifles and a quantity of
| ammunition on hand for the purpose of
j defense, but the witness thought it best
to leave the property at the mercy of
the mob, especially as he, as a matter
of business precaution, notified the
County Commissioners several days
previously that the county would be
held responsible for any damage done
the company's property. Burbidge also
stated that his company had refused to
arbitrate with the Miners' Union, al
though requested to do so by Governor
Steunenberg, and saidrthat whenever a ;
union man was found working in the ;
mine he was at once discharged. The I
! policy of the company for years had
been to employ no union men. The
wages were 50 cents and $1 per day less I
than the union scale.
Burch, superintendent of the mine, ;
i followed Burbidge on the stand. His |
testimony was of a similar character.
A barricade of about forty ore cars had
been formed near the tunnel entrance 1
and men with Winchesters were placed ;
there to protect the property, but wit
ness, when he heard the mob was com- ,
ing, took to the hills and had covered
about two miles when the train reached j
the station.
Senator Heltfeldt arrived here to-day. i
It was understood he came for the pur
pose of personally investigating the sit
uation and to lay the matter before
Congress at its next session.

CONDITIONS ARE
MOST SERIOUS IN
THE PHILIPPINES
The Roseate Military View Not
Borne Out by a True State?
merit of Facts. '
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MANILA, June 27 (via Hongkong,
June 30).â opposite views of the
Philippine situation are held by those
persons who have followed the Amer
ican campaign with close attention.
First is the official military view.
According to this the situation is now
well in hand and the campaign has
been as successful as possaible. The
natives are tired of the insurrection
and are more friendly toward the
Americans than toward the Insurgents.
The insurgent army is made up almost
entirely of brigands, who can no longer
be held together by their leaders. War
will soon be over, it is declared, if the
wet season holds off.
The force of troops now on hand is
sufficient for any emergency. Business
is picking up.
The disorganized insurrection, de
prived of its resources, is held to
gether at present entirely by the hope
given the 'rebels through the anti-an
nexation movement in the United
States and the American papers which
'â  reach here. The insurgent leaders are
j actuated solely by selfish personal am
bitions. .;>
The second view, which is held by the
; military men in the held and leading
! thinkers, is that as the ability of our
troops to drive the insurgents at will
j has been proved the suppression of the
insurrection^ depends upon the ability
; of the men in authority to cope with
| the situation and not upon muzzling the
American press:
j The outlook at present is more gloomy
i for the speedy ending of the war than
ever before. The method of making
! raids into the country and then with-
I drawing, leaving friendly natives at
j the mercy of returning insurgents, has
tended to alienate the population and
not materially to weaken the insur
gents. â â ; -I-
The organization of the insurgents is
still good and their resources are not
greatly impaired.
The* failure this season to take the
j railroads running through the valley
1 of the rice country above San Fernando
leaves to the enemy immense resources
' and fails to protect the interests of for
j eign merchants. :â¢" ; :
With the present methods the war
j with the Filipinos can continue indefi
j nitely. The only true method to pacify
the country is to garrison all the im
â  portant towns. To do this more than
! twice the number of troops already
here, including volunteers, is neces
sary, with several regiments of mounted
cavalry. Four thousand men being in
the hospital, 4SOO in the southern islands
1 and 16,000 in Manila, Cavite.and small
! garrisons, this leaves only 8000 men for
active campaigning. This number is
not sufficient, since the ' troops in the
north are in bad condition, many of
the soldiers having irritated hearts by
reason of overexertion. On account of
the small number of troops available
new advances are constantly required
and frequent changes of exhausted
regiments. There Is a great waste of
time and energy of ' the men by long
j marches to the front.
Non-combatants are more friendly
toward the insurgents. than toward the
I Americans on account mainly of the
! petty tyranny of the soldiers. Isolated
i insurgent outrages are only a repetition
of similar isolated acts of our own men.
A pioneer and engineer corps is much
i needed for the building of good roads.

STRIKE BEGUN
AT HOMESTEAD
Danger of a Repetition
of Strife of '92.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG, June 30.â Post to
morrow will say: A strike was in
augurated at the Homestead Steel
Works to-day which may rival the bbart r
tle between capital and labor which
was fought on that famous spot seven
years ago. The discharge of fifteen
men at the plant during the past three
weeks is at the bottom of the trouble.
These men were dismissed because of
their affiliation with the newly formed
lodge of the Amalgamated Association.
The strike, of whatever proportions
it may be, was precipitated to-day
when a committee of nine men, who
sought the reinstatement of the dis
charged men, were also discharged for
the same season. Superintendent Corey
informed the men that no organized
men. would be retained, though it be
came necessary to close down the en
tire plant.
At a secret meeting of the men. held
on Thursday, it was decided to stand
by the organization, and in the event
of the discharge of any of their mem
bers all would strike.
When the nine men were discharged
to-day they were not permitted to re
turn to the mill, and the walkout was
not immediately carried out, but event
ually one of the men gained access to
the workmen with the result that late
to-night (according to the president of
the Amalgamated Association at Home-,
stead) two thousand men have quit,
and all departments are more or less
crippled. â ',â :

AN AGED COUPLE
FOULLY MURDERED
Hacked to Death in Their
Mountain Cabin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANGELS TAMP June 30.â the
high mountains, about forty miles from
this place, an atrocious crime was com
mitted by a young man while in a mad
rage, after being repeatedly refused a
piece of property which belonged to his
aged uncle. The news was brought here
by a logger, Jacob Whitsone, who has
been working in th vicinity of Jon
athan Baker's place, cutting timber.
The details as given by him are hor
rible in the extreme.
An Indian girl called Mamuela came |
into the logging camp at an early hour j
on Wednesday morning and said that
Baker had been killed by a young fel- '
low at his cabin. She would not talk
further. A party started for the scene
and found Baker lying on the floor of
his home in a pool of blood. Near him
lay his wife cold in (loath.
Baker's head was crushed in and had
a great gash through it made by an '
ax. Mrs. Baker's head was completely
severed from the body and the left arm
was terribly hacked. Wounds were
seen on the face and body. After a
search of the premises was made about
$200 was found, and that, taken with
the fact that the place was in an or
derly condition, Indicated that robbery
was not the motive for the crime.
The Indian girl was made to talk fur
ther under great pressure, and she told j
in her broken language how a young
man named Biggs, a nephew of Baker, :
was angry with the couple .because they j
would not give him the place on which j
they lived. He had been offered a pic.cc
of twenty acres, and this but increased
his anger. He had made threats on sev- j
eral occasions, and of late had acted I
queerly and seemed to thtink of noth
ing but the old people's refusal to deed j
him the property. He had left the j
cabin where he stayed a few mornings
ago very early and had not returned. i
He has not been seen since, and a party j
is searching for him, as it is believed 1
that he is the guilty man.
The logging camp near the scene of I
the crime is called Molinas Camp, and
is in an almost inaccessible part of the
country. Whitsone was not very well ;
versed in the geography of the country,
and was not certain of the exact loca
tion further than it is near the State
line. Baker and his wife were over 60
years. of age, and young Biggs is but
26 years. y- "y. ;;.â¢â¢:

CITY HALL PLUMBING.
Supervisors Will Make Such Repairs i
â¢ as Are Necessary.'
..The Building Committee of the Super
â  visors met yesterday and voted in favor
of reporting â¢ the petition of Bateman
Bros, for an extension of sixty days' time
In which to. complete the Hall of Justice.
The contractors have filed a bond for $5000
with Mayor Phelan as trustee for the
completion of the building In the speci
fied time, and the contractors for furni
ture and supplies are granted permission
to enter the building at all times after
July 1 for the purpose of furnishing the
rooms.
A communication was received from the
Board of Health, signed by J. J. Sullivan.
W. H. Kelly and" P. F. Ward, reporting

no outlet for sewage. The committee
amended that it be empowered to
confer with Mayor Phelan and Shea &
Shea, architects, to ascertain the repairs
necessary to be made to the City Hall
and the estimated cost.
After the committee adjourned Super

will confer with the Mayor and Shea &
Shea, the architects, in a few days, when
an estimate of the repairs necessary will
be reached.
MERRY ROW IN THE
LOCAL PRFSS CLUB
DIRECTORS QUARREL, OVER A
CANDIDATE.
Evening Paper Rivalry Results in an
Insult to E. W. Scripps and the
Withdrawal of His
Employe.
A merry row is in progress in the di
rectory of the Press Club, arid it is all
over the rivalry of two evening papersâ
; the Report and the Bulletin. Representa
tives of these Journals have very definite
and disagreeable opinions of each other,
and they have carried their differences
into the newspaper club. The incident of
contention is .'. W. Scripps, the proprie
tor of the Report. On April IS J. T. Tyler,
the litjancial secretary of the Press Club,
wrote a letter to E. W. Scripps, begging
him to become a non-resident member of
the club. Mr. Tyler told Mr. Scripps what
a good fellow he is and how glad ' the
members of the club would be to welcome
him Into their midst. .
Mr. Tyler was particularly flattering,
and Informed Mr. Scripps that the mem
bership roll of the Press Club would really
be incomplete without his name. The
, proprietor of the Report was given every
: assurance that the proposal of his name
woud meet the prompt approval of . the
directors, In ten days Mr. . Scripps- an
swered Mr. Tyler, permitting the use of
his name for non-residence membership
and telling how pleased he would be to
j enjoy the good fellowship .and hospitality
of the Press Club when he came to the
city. Mr. Scripps' initiation fee and dues
for a year were accepted and he was pro
posed for membership. . .
Then the. row began. J. T. Tyler, the
very man who had asked Scripps to. join
j the- club, fought the election of the candi
date. Mr. Tyler declared at a meeting of
the directory that Scripps paid atrociously
j low wages and took boastful pride in the
I fact. Mr. Tyler therefore opposed- the
election of Mr. Scripps as a member. The
cause of Tyler's sudden change of temper
jis due to the fact, it is said, that .he : is a
member .of the Bulletin staff. The other
members of the directory took the matter
under advisement and the application of
Scripps for -membership, remained un
touched for- weeks.
Finally. George A. Gohen. the editor of
the Report, began an investigation of the
matter. He felt that an insult -had been
offered to his employer and he sought
ah explanation. He could gain no satis
faction, although he is a member of the
Press Club. Losing patience, he wrote to
Scripps, asking the right to withdraw the
Scripps application, This was readily
granted, and now Mr. Scripps doesn't
want to be a member of the Press Club.
Gohen has resigned from the club and has \
posted in his office a notice commanding i
the members of his staff to' resign from
the Press Club or withdraw from the Re
port. - . . : - '
"The action of the Press Club," said.
Gohen, In discussing the matter, "is a
contemptible trick, unworthy of gentle
men. Mr. Scripps did not seek admission
to the club and gave the use of his name
Itemptlble trick, unworthy of gentle-
Mr. Scripps did not seek admission
he club and gave the use of his name
simply as an act of friendship. I can see
In the whole affair an underhand attack
by the Bulletin people."

- â â¦- â
The Mechanics' Fair and Industrial Ex
hibition to be given under the auspices of
the Mechanics' Institute from September
2 to October 7 will present some extraor
dinary attractions. Principal among
these is the Filipino exhibit of twenty
five natives, including nine musicians,
which will leave Manila to-day on the
steamer Leelanaw.
The directors received a cablegram that
sixty of the Islanders would take part in
.the local exhibition, but this number was
cut down to twenty-five at the request of
the Government authorities at Washing
ton. General Otis refused to allow the
transportation of six ponies and three
water, buffaloes, but permission was final
ly obtained from .the Treasury Depart
ment and the animals will form an inter
esting part of the display. ' ' '
Besides the Filipinos --the institute will
Import a large and varied collection of
curios so that an excellent idea may be
obtained of the habits and resources of
the people in our new island possessions.
Another special attraction will be the ap
pearance of Miss Alice Raymond, the tal
ented cornetist, with Bennett's band,
which will furnish the music.
Miss Raymond is rated as a distin
guished mistress of the popular instru
ment and has made emphatic hits wher
ever she has appeared. She was a stellar
attraction at the Oroheum in this city a
few years ago. She is now performing at
Manhattan Beach, but will give up her
engagement to come, to this coast. She
has a charming, personality and a ward
robe that is the envy of the ladles. Miss
Raymond has received a number of medals
and decorations for her performances on
the cornet and is destined to add to her
laurels at the coming exhibition".
There will also be an exhibit of a Porno
Indian family from Ukiah. It comprises
seven persons named Naubatel, among
Miss. Alice Raymond.
whom are two old arrowhead makers,
probably the only existing exponents of
the art in America to-day. It is intended
to have an exhibit of automobiles, be
sides a road race during the fair to de
termine the relative Qualifications of the
machines now in use. In view of the
automobile Journey across the continent
inaugurated by The Call-Herald, this
promises to be one of the most interesting
features of the fair.
Besides these attractions there will, be
exemplified the late wireless telegraphy
and the automatic voting machine, and
recitals on a pipe organ. Arrangements
are now being made with a family of re
nowned flying trapeze artists to give an
elaborate display of their perilous art.
The exhibition will surpass all previous
efforts, and this knowledge has Increased
the ' demand for space in the Pavilion,
which up to date is greater than ever
before.. _______^___
THE SANTA FE LEASE
IS EFFECTIVE TO-DAY
An Important Railroad Deal Which
Is Now in Opera
tion.
Pome time ago the Southern Pacific
granted to the Santa Fe by a ninety-nine
year lease the joint use of the Tehachapl
division from Mohave to Bakerslleld.
This was. to prevent the Santa Fe after
it had acquired the Valley road from run
ning a line 'parallel to the said division.
The lease goes into effect to-day, allow
ing local freights to be handled entirely
by Santa Fe. people from Stockton to any
point on their system.
Through freight and passenger business,
however, will continue to be hauled In
Southern Pacific cars from San Francisco
and Mohave north, until the Valley road
is completed from Richmond down to San
Francisco, thus giving the Santa Fe a
terminal point In this city.
Man and Money Missing.
George D. Gruenig & Co., of 2930 Twen
ty-fifth street, would be much delighted
if the former clerk of the. firm would re
port for duty and make an accounting of
something like JSOO which they say has
followed him and which the firm claims
as its property. .: -â '.â¢_'
The missing man. ls known as James P.
Grace, who was formerly in the employ
of D. F. Keefe at Harrison and Twenty
third streets. While in Keefe's service
he was suspected of carrying off some
of the goods without either paying for
them or entering them on the books of
his employer. For this infraction of the
rules of well-conducted houses he was
discharged. He lost no time, however,
in applying for a clerkship with the firm
who now mourns his departure.
He represented to Gruenig & Co. that
he could secure a lot of Keefe's custom
ers for them and on these representations
he was secured. His absence from work
aroused the suspicions of the firm and an
examination of the books revealed a
shortage of the amount named. His par
ents who live at 2931 Twenty-fourth
street, have offered to make good the
amount taken, but Gruenig & Co. would
not accept the proffer. Captain Gillin of
the Mission district was informed of the
affair and Detectives Graham and Fitz
gerald are now looking for the missing
Grace. .
The erring young man is only 20 years
Jld, but he has shown wonderful speed
for his years.

CALIFORNIA ACTRESS
RETURNS TO HER HOME
MISS FREDA
GALLICK,
the talented
C a. 1 i fornia
actress, who went
East last year to
win laurels in the
theatrical field,
Is due to arrive
in this city to
day after a sea
son of triumph
and with the un
qualified praise
of captious East
ern critics. The
gifted young
woman, who
made her debut
with the Fraw
ley Company at
the Columbia In
1893, has just fin
ished a most suc
cessful season as
leading lady with
the Robert
Downing Co m
pany.
Miss Gallic
has played sue
roles as Pauline
in the "French
Marriage," Par
thenia in "Ingo
mar, the Barba
rian," and Neo
damla in "Th
Gladiator," in a
of which she
earned, for her
self an enviable
reputation. When
she appeared 'as
Mme. Guichart in
"The Comman
der," one of the New York critics said of her that she was a brilliant, beau
tiful actress of great promise, and in Milwaukee she was regarded as pos
sessing dash, beauty and exceptional grace.
Miss Gallick will spend her vacation at her mother's home, 414 Bu
chanan street, and while there will consider the offers of several Eastern
managers who are bidding for her services.
PROTECTION
TO RETURNING
VOLUNTEERS
Camp of Detention at
Angel Island.

ARRIVAL OF TWO TROOPS OF
THE FOURTH CAVALRY.
â¦- â
They Had a Lively Trip Across From
Yellowstone Park â A Good
Berth for an Old
Soldier.
There will be no risks of disease taken
with the volunteers when they return
from the Philippines. The presence of
the plague in the ports of Asia has roused
the department to take action townrd pre
venting its presence ' here through the
medium of the returning troops, and to
that end there is now being established on
Angel Island a "camp of detention" for
such regiments as are found to have been
exposed to contagion. Should any con
tagious or infectious disease gain a foot
hold in the camps at the Presidio the
result would be most serious. Soldiers
in camp are not in a position to withstand
epidemics so well as those in barracks,
and the department has decided to meet
the matter before it is necessary, in order
to be ready should the necessity come.
The new camp will be established at
Quarry Point, on the east side of Angel
Island. The location is but a mile and a
half from the present post and across the
ridge. It is nearly the same distance from
the quarantine station. The* site is where
the stables and temporary buildings were
erected for the engineers while the quarry
was being worked, and Is close to the
beach. The camp will accommodate about
1500 men. It Is the intention to quarter
there all troops coming in on Infected
transports, should any arrive, taking any
case of disease to the quarantine station
to be cared for there. No cases will be
allowed to remain in the camp. It Is In
tended only to provide a suitable place
to detain troops during the "observation"
period demanded by the quarantine laws
and dictated by experience. In most cases
this is seven days.
The men in camp will be In command of
their own officers, but the sanitary reg
ulations will be supervised by the quar
antine Officers over the hill. The need of
such a camp of detention has been admit
ted by the officers in charge, but it was
not until within the week that the au
thorities at Washington would authorize
the work. Now that it has been started
It will be rushed through without delay.
The greatest difficulty will be found In
the wharf to be built out on the site of
the present old structure. It must be
large enough to admit of docking the
McDowell. â¢
â¢The water supply was also a matter for
serious consideration, but Colonel Mar
shal the department quartermaster, be
lieves there will be a sufficient quantity
upon the island. If not, the same arrange
ment as has been found necessary at Al
catraz will have to be adoptedâ the Mc-
Dowell must bring it over from here and
pump it into retaining tanks. It may not
be necessary to use the new camp at all,
and the department hopes such will be
the case; but If it should be. everything
will be In readiness. The Oregon. Regi
ment should be here, within ten days and
the camp will' be. finished by then.
Troops D and H of the Fourth Cavalry
arrived at the- Presidio yesterday and
went into camp to await their turn to sail
for Manila. They will be away within a
month. Both troops were stationed at
the Yellowstone Park, where they had
been doing patrol duty for two years.
They have left behind a corporal and four
men, who are still on one of the winter
stations, the snow being so- deep they
could not get at the little post to take the
men out. There Is a surprise awaiting
them when the snow melts.
The trip of the two troops out here was
not uneventful. They Intended to come
by way of Spokane, but a washout com
pelled "them to journey by way of Ogden,
and they lost a good deal of time in that
way. While speeding westward ti.e sparks
from the engine set fire to one of the
cars and the train, was halted while, the
troopers turned firemen and put out the
blaze.
During the morning two companies of
the Twenty-fifth Regiment and several
detachments of colored recruits were sent
from the Presidio onto the Pennsylvania,
there to await her departure. She was
not able to get to sea last night, as the
delay of the troops coming overland held
her "back. The headquarters and band of
the Twenty-fourth Infantry have receive*;
more orders regarding their start for Ma
nila They are now hooked for the City
of Para, which will sail on July 12.
Second Lieutenant Maxwell Keyes,
Third Infantry, and Second Lieutenant
Samuel W. Noyes, Twenty-third Infantry,
have been assigned to duty with the re
cruits at the Presidio. â
First Sergeant Brown of Company H
of the Twenty-fourth Regiment has been
assigned to duty with the recruiting sta
tion in this city. Sergeant Brown was
with the Twenty-fourth In Cuba. He was
wounded In the fight on July 1 and since

Warm Meeting of the Fourth of July
Committee Over a Shortage in
the Subscription List.
Crowds of . perspiring patriots with
! bristling enthusiasm as an .outer decora
tion kept the ooorknobs of the Fourth of
July committee rooms at white heat dur
ing yesterday- afternoon and evening. At
4 o'clock the chairmen of the various
committees met, George Fletcher, chair
man of the general committee, presiding.
General discussion at this session
brought out. the fact that the committer
would be some $C>oo shy in their expense
account when the- time for a settlement
arrived. A squirming and stroking of
brows followed this announcement, and
every head of a committee wanted to
know immediately whether or no he would
be held personally for the deficit in funds
collected. At the evening session tho
matter â  came UP for full consideration.
The promises that had been made early
in the career of the executive committee
| that extravagant subscriptions would be
' forthcoming were remembered and the
: promisers were called to task. Chris
topher Stader had pledged untold wealth
! from the Misslonites, who so strenuously
advocated Glen Park as the theater of a.
grand pyrotechnic display. According to
â  the report of Gustavus Schnee, a collec-
I tor, who "wore out three pairs of shoes"
i in his endeavors to get together $87 and
some few cents, the Mission district fell
sadly short in its promises. When the
i committee heard the report it applauded
i Schnee's efforts, regretted the consump
tion of sole leather and gave voice to a
I great Indignation that the Mission people
: should have neglected the opportunity.
; The result was an erasure of Glen Park
from the schedule of fireworks exhibits.
The Mission pyrotechnic display will be
; held at Sixteenth and Folsom streets and
.' now Shnee wants his $S7 back. He says
: he will order the bank to refuse payment
; of the check.
The contracts for two $700 displays still
i hold. One will be at the Chutes, the
j second at the Sixteenth and Folsom street
grounds, and the third, a $400 display. in
the North End district. The residents of
I the last named location proved genuine
; patriots if a donation of money may be
| taken as- evidence. They promised but
$200 and twice that sum has. been collect
!ed in subscriptions. For their generosity
they will be blessed with $400 worth of
blue fire and specialties.
Alf Borllnl, as head of the parade com
! mittee, assures a procession 9000 in line
i with a variety of spectacular features.
i Fred Raabe, in sententious phras
[ lug, asked for $1259 50 for the bands
iln the parade. The literary com
mittee asked for $50 only. When the
! carriage committee report was read si
â  lence fell upon all. Jim O'Brien, chair
: man, made a speech about vulgar luxury
i and hoped that the invited guests would

The Railroad Commission Will Fight
Out the Passenger Transporta
tion Case in the Su
preme Court.
The Market Street Railway Company |
must continue its tight to prevent the j
Board of Railroad Commissioners from (
examining Into the corporation accounts ;
and fixing therefrom the rates passengers j
shall pay on the company's lines in this |
city. Some time ago the commission en- j
deavored to examine the corporation's i
accounts and fix the rates, but on an ac- â 
tion heard by Judge Seawell, it was de- '
cided that the Market Street Company i
was not a transportation company within J
the rule of the law and hence the com
mission had, no right to proceed further j
in its efforts on behalf of the people. 'â 
j Yesterday a notice of appeal from this j
\ judgment was filed in the Superior Court I
I and the case will now be determined be
fore the Supreme Court.
The action from which the appeal was
taken was in the nature of an application ;
for a peremptory writ of mandate Â° to
: compel Joseph L. Willcutt, secretary of j
! the Market Street Company, to appear j
j before the commission with the books of
j the company to show the amount of capi- i
I tal Invested, amount of capital stock â 
common and capital stock preferred paid j
: In, receipts, expenditures and all mat- :
ters pertaining to the running of the en- ,
I tire system on which the rates could be
1 fixed by the commission, in accordance j
I with the power vested by the constltti- '
tion. The application for a writ of man- j.
j date set forth that on April It. 18%, the ,
i commission determined to investigate the j
affairs of the corporation with the object
lin view of establishing proper charges
for the transportation of passengers. It
was necessary that the books of, the
; company should be examined, and in con- \
' sequence, on August 13 of the same year
Secretary Willcutt was subpenaed to ap- ;
pear before the commission and furnish i
â¢ it with the information desired.
On September 7. the day set for the |
hearing. Mr. Willcutt, accompanied by j
! Attorney Forstay Walker, appeared be
fore the board and refused to comply
with the demand of the commission. Suit
to compel compliance was brought, tin* :
commission claiming the right to exam
ine the company's books and accounts.
i The company filed answer, denying that
the Market Street Railway Company was
a transportation company and denied the
| commission's claim to the right to fix
the rates. ~>â , , i. . _ â
The action was heard by Judge Seawell.
argument on the status of the company j
occupying several days. At the end |
Judge Seawell held that the contentions ;
; of the company were the correct conten
tions. Hence he refused to issue the writ
1 and dismissed the action. Through the ;
i filing of the appeal, however, the Su
preme Court must finally determine
whether or not the commission is vested

BOUGHT STOLEN BRASS.
Morris Seideman, Junk Dealer, Held
to Answer Before the Superior
Court.
Morris Seideman. the junk dealer on
Fourteenth street charged with receiving
stolen property in the shape of brass
stolen from Southern Pacific cars by boys,
was yesterday held to answer before the
Superior Court by Judge Conlan In $2000
bonds. . .. , . . .
Attorney Deuprev, for the defendant,
raised the point that the section of the
Penal Code under which the defendant
was charged was invalid, as it provided
for a double penalty; but the Judge over
ruled the objection. - - .
Seideman testified in his own behalf and
denied buying any brass from the boys
or urging them to steal it. He also denied
having sold any brass to the Western
Foundry on First street, but the book
keeper "of the firm was called In rebuttal
and showed from his. books that pur
chases had been made from Seideman.
CONTEMPT OF COURT.
Witnesses Who Refused to Testify
Before a Referee in Bankruptcy.
Some days ago James N. Hyde and F.
W. Crandall were subpenaed to appear
before W. A. Coulter, referee In bank
ruptcy at San Jose, and testify in the
matter of the insolvency of E. B. How
ard. By advice of their counsel, they
refused to testify, and the referee re
ported them to United States District
Judge de Haven. The court yesterday
handed .down an opinion to the effect
that Hyde and Crandall were guilty of
technical contempt, but no penalty was
imposed, the court being advised that
Hyde and Crandall would testify if re
quired to do so.

Remember that the Southern Pacific
is selling tickets for those splendid
Lake Tahoe excursions to-day, to-mor
row and Monday for $11 30, good on the
6 o'clock evening' train, and embracing
one, of the finest trips on the Western
continent. You will regret it if you
don't go. The cost is really less than
half the single fare. ' Plenty of time is
given to visit any of the lake's match
less resorts since you are not obliged
to return until Thursday next. Pur
chase tickets and obtain pretty Tahoe
folders at the S. P.'s city ticket office,
613 Market street, or at ferry depot.
A Muscle Snapped.
Lieutenant Birdsall while running to
catch a car yesterday felt something in
his left leg snap, which brought him to
a sudden halt. He was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where it was found that
one of the muscles or ligaments in his leg
had snapped. It will cause him consid
erable annoyance tor a time, but he re
fused to lay off duty.
El Campo.
Four round trips to-morrow of the
speedy Ukiah will give all a favorable op
portunity to visit the popular picnic
grounds. Notwithstanding the extensive
demands made on the company by people
leaving the city for the Fourth, the Ukiah
will be retained on the El Campo run to
morrow as usual. It Is the only spot near
the city where it never gets hot and never
grows delightful all day long, with
out winds or fog. That Is the real reason
of Its continued popularityâ that and the
courteous treatment accorded to the pub
lic by all connected with the California
Northwestern.

McCarthy's Mistake.
James McCarthy, 152 Clara street, told
Charles H. Levin in a saloon at Sixth and
Harrison streets yesterday afternoon that
he was going to thrash Levin's brother.
Levin warned him that he could not do
it. and angry words massed between them.
Levin finally struck McCarthy on the left
ear and he fell, striking on his head. Mc-
Carthy was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital and Levin was locked up in the City

EXPRESS DISCRIMINATION.
/"TV F the fact that, in the matter of the internal
OF the fact law. Wells, Fargo & internal
re\ rip law, Weils, Fargo & Co. is
V~^ making the most unjust discriminations there
can: be no. doubt. Wherever, under precisely similar
conditions, two men for identical services are charged
different rates by a common carrier, that is illegal :
discrimination at the common law as well as under
tin- constitutions and statutes of the different States.
The elementary principle applicable to the subject is
that all customers shall be served alike. Therefore,
if Wells. Fargo & Co. compels some of its patrons
to pay lor stamps and relieves others, it exercises
illegal discrimination, for which it is liable to some
penalty, if i: be true that, under the law, wherever
there is a right there is a remedy, and wherever there
U J A
is a wrong it can be redressed.
As the Southern Pacific Company of Kentucky was
organized to override the constitution and the laws of
this State, so Wells. Fargo & Co., essentially a Cali
fornian organization, for the same purpose was incor
porated under the constitution and the laws of Colo
rado. It has long been the opinion of man> f-.cellent
lawyers that, when directly challenged before a thor
oughly competent and upright tribunal, this mode of
importing foreign law and virtually repealing domes
tic law would be thoroughly uprooted, "and, but for
the majority of the present Railroad Commission, this
result might have been accomplished in the grain case
before Judge Morrow.
Without presuming to decide legal questions, how
ever, The Call suggests in the case of Wells.' -Fargo
& Co., apart from any private remedies that indi
viduals may possess, that it would be proper for the
Attorney General of the State to take up the discrimi
nations to which allusion has been made and ascertain
whether they cannot be used as the basis of a proceed
ing on behalf of the State to arrest the local business
of Wells. Fargo & Co. To an ordinary citizen it
would appear that there is existing lav.- that would jus
tify such action. The illegal exercise of a corporate
franchise in many cases is a sufficient ground for tak
ing away its charter. The constitution of 1879, man
datory in its provisions, is unusually stringent in the
protection it seeks at least to extend to the public. By
article XII, section 7, it provides that "no corporation
organized outside the limits of this State shall be al
lowed to transact business within this State on more
favorable conditions than are prescribed by law to
similar corporations organized under the laws of this
State." Section 17 of the same article declares all
transportation companies, without exception, to be
common carriers and subject to legislative control.
Section 20 of the same article, invalidating monopolis
tic combinations among common carriers, is followed
by section 21. which absolutely prohibits all discrimi
nation in charges.
Therefore, in reference to its business within this
State of all kinds, but especially and definitely in re
lation to so much' of its business as begins and ends
within the State limits, Wells, Fargo & Co. is a for- .
eign corporation, he'd strictly within the provisions i
of our constitution. It is prohibited from the discrim- â¢
ination and the favoritism of which it is daily guilty
so clearly that "he who runs may read." Now, is there !
no prompt and efficacious remedy that the Attorney
General can apply? The ordinary processes of civil ,
litigation by and on behalf of individuals are too slow
and too cumbersome. The mischief does not merely I
affect the persons, firms or corporations with which j
Wells, Fargo & Co. deals. It constitutes a deep- j
rooted and an expensive evil, by which the public, es
pecially the representatives of the solid business in
terests of the State, are daily affected. There is not !
and there never has been assigned a single plausible
reason for the unpatriotic imposition of the Federal
stamp tax upon so much of the community as in !
order to secure delay and to carry the question over !
the war necessities has not been specially exempted. j
There is every reason that could appeal to a high- I
minded State official to impel the Attorney General, of
whose fidelity to his trust no one lias yet complained,
to test the question, whether, in California, equality
before the law is a reality or a sham and a pretense.
The "Dewey torpedo" has proved its worth
against the enemy, but that is no reason why young
San Francisco should monkey with it on the Fourth
of July.
Attorney General Ford's opinion that it is the duty
of the State Board of Equalization to levy assessments
on refrigerator cars looks like another blow at the
iceman.
THE BOARD OF HEALTH-
PHYSIC is. a learned profession. â¢' It ranks with,
law and divinity in its 'dignity, and young men
I of culture, 'desirous of filling an honorable
place in the world, choose. between the three, accord
ing to their taste and the promptings of inclination.
. There are not wanting examples of gentlemen who have
| had a high standing in two. of these professions. Dr.
Taylor of 'this city has the highest, training in both
law and medicine-, and. is a scholar, of repute. and a
citizen to â whom'the. city turns' always with confidence.
In .Oakland the -senior-' Dr. Wythe, had a high reputa
â  tion in the pulpit and one of peculiar strength as a
physician, and a specialist in microscopy.
j ; .Medicine-, is -a profession-, that' especially . develops
the ge.rrtlemahly Quality-: because its .possession is ab
'splu'tely requisite i'n : a man who enters, families at mo
â  .merits of the-, highest apprehension, and who of ne
cessity must have confidential: knowledge of the most
secret'concerns of life. ' This : character in -the physi
; cian-.is so well understood- to be necessary, that the law
harks it up by locking. .lips upon those personal
facts which -he learns, in the practice of his profession.
â ' : -M-edical ethics, isa system- of: long growth, intended
ho' foster and -preserve good- character in the. physi
tian' and keep. the : body of the. profession unspotted.
',: Every -mart who takes the oath of Aesculapius binds
â¢his con'science^toithe upholding. of ethics, and his con
duct. to : the.- path in -which gentlemen must walk.
... In' every city in the United States the physicians are
" -regarded- asa guild-of gentlemen, and the respect paid j
them is. of. the. first rank.' This long developed and
well-maintained e.le'metit of high personal character in -
lithe - profession has impressed gentle and simple alike".
/When we had .frontiers; and when 'mining camps and
: cowboy^reridexvefus' were' as. rough and reckless and
wild as unrestrained, riian- can make them, the physi
cian 1 was' always safe to .go and. come, day or night.
! Men who- -would- -not hesitate: to rob or kill another
would: make up the 'escort 'of ; the doctor and defend
| him with their lives, : if need-were;- It is incumbent on
every 'doctor of medicine to do everything to main
tain "and justify this popular-estimate of his profession
and ( do nothing- "to tarnish it... In these latter days new
honors are being won by physic. The secrets of na
ture; locked ip in the human â body' are being one by
one revealed, and the- final- cause of many ills that end
life untimely is being exposed;-reri}edied and removed.
Now i-; the wrong, time-, it" there .could 'ever be a :
right time, for any physician to. desert his professional
ethics and character. It is, therefore, peculiarly pain
-1 ful, not only to honorable physicians' but to thought
... . . â¢ . 'â  r r â¢ 1 J I
ful laymen, to see the members of/this learned, dig- ;
nified and honorable profession who have 'been ap
pointed to the Board of Health in this city- compelled
to obey the dictates of a party boss and make admin
istrative appointments in their: office that Would de- j
stroy the good name of a tripe Factory.
That they submitted unwillingly is. evident. .but that i
they submitted at all is deplorable. That they feel
painfully their position is a greater 'compliment to j
their conscience than to their courage.- It is said that
' they had to accept their office subject to the mortgage
of the boss, and that had they not done so others
would. We dislike to believe this. Every man in the ;
profession should stand united; in the. pledge not to
accept any place to which the profession may- aspire
unless it may be had and held under conditions which
conform to the code of ethics and permit the main
tenance unsullied of the character and contacts' which
are the pride of the good physician. If' this esprit de
corps were kept, up the politicians and the bosses'
would be powerless. To appoint the unspeakable
Dennery, and the other unthinkable creatures forced
upon them, to places where honorable men must meet
them and associate with them is a sad degradation of
the medical character. â¢ â¢ .

of deserved standing. Not one of them, if left to the- I
promptings of his own knowledge of the fitness of j
things, would have obeyed the boss's orders in mak- j
ing their appointments. A gentleman deserves to as- ;

greatly if he freely seek such official associations as
that of Dennery and the other selections of the boss, j
who reek with the feculence of the political gutter. .
The homes into which physicians enter, when the
emergency of illness and the sorrows of the sick room
close them to all others, will shrink from even this
secondary contact with the uncleanness of crooked'

they made these appointments, can they answer that
merit "controlled, or dare they answer that Dennery :

A WORD IN SEASON.
nAY the celebration of the Glorious Fourth be '[
I \ joyous and jubilant in every respect and in '
every city, village and countryside through
out the republic. Let the patriotic ardor of youth be j
everywhere vigorous and exultant in its manifestations i
of pride in the greatness of the nation, but let there i
be also a certain reason and discretion in it all, that j
the joy of the day be not marred by fires or accidents. '
With the eagerness characteristic of young America
the celebration of the Fourth has been to some extent
anticipated. The rattle of crackers and other juvenile
fireworks is to be heard toward evening in nearly all :
parts of the city. The menace of Fourth, of July fires j
is therefore already upon us, and from now on until j
the close of the celebration all citizens should be on ;
guard.
One of the evils of our popular methods of cele
brating the Fourth on the streets is that of employing i
large bombs instead of the comparatively harmless !
firecracker. The tendency to use as large a bomb as j
the law will permit is natural. Each boy desires to !
make as much noise as he can, and feels his own size I
and importance increase in proportion to the size and ;
detonating power of the firework he explodes. Could '
the youngsters have their way they would shoot oft
whole kegs of powder on the streets and think it great
fun.
The great evil of the bomb, however, does not come
from the small boy, but from the hoodlum or the
practical joker who takes advantage of the freedom
of the Fourth to throw crackers or even bombs under
the feet of persons passing along the sidewalk. Not
even women are spared from such attacks, and fre
quently serious accidents result from them. All such
practices should of course be suppressed as far as pos
sible, and to that end public sentiment should co
operate to aid and encourage the police in preventing
them.
There is no reason why the Fourth of July should
not be celebrated with ample freedom by all classes
of citizens, young or old, but at the same time with
entire safety to property and to person,. If the heads

of. families would exercise a wholesome restraint upon
a 1 too exuberant and thoughtless youth, and the city
authorities impose. due restrictions upon the offend
ers of larger growth, we might have a celebration of
Independence day that would be a festival of rejoicing
not diminished by loss to any one. It will be worth
while for all to give heed to the subject at this time.
A little extra watchfulness may mean preservation
from serious loss or disaster in many a household.
THE COMING AUTOMOBILE.
ROM the office of the Herald in New York
there will start this morning an automobile for j
a journey across the continent to The Call office :
lin San Francisco. Among the people who will form |
the throng to greet it on its arrival here will be some !
who crossed the plains in ox teams because there was i
Ino other means of transportation. Such. has been the i
â¢ development of facilities for travel in the course of
i fifty years.
To the great mass of people the automobile is as
yet hardly more than a sort of costly scientific toy. A
few years ago it was considered as something almost
.in the same class with the airship. Mmv believed it
would be invented in the course of time, but compara
tively few expected to see it in operation on ordinary
roads, as a machine' of practical value before the close
, of the century. And now it is coming, not as a toy to
; be exhibited at expositions, not as a novelty for rich
\ men to amuse themselves with in .racing, "nor as a
: vehicle for use only on well paved streets, but as a
means of travel and transportation suitable for nearly
all, localities and available for long distance as well as
for short trips.
In Europe and in the East it is noted that automo
biles are comihg into use so rapidly that predictions
j are: made they will soon be almost as common on the
â  streets as bicycles. â¢ At the present time there is a good
deal of objection to them in some quarters because
j they frighten horses. That objection, however, will
; pass away when the frequency with which the machine
is seen will render horses familiar -with it as they are
now with electric cars. In time even the country roads
will show almost as many automobiles as wagons, and
: their passage will cause no more disturbance than that
j of any other form of vehicle.
' The forerunner of the coming revolution in trans
i portation is the automobile which The Call and the
! Herald have engaged. to make the grand journey
j across the continent and which begins to-day. As it
â¢ passes along the highways of the nation in its west
ward course it will be to thousands of people the sen
, sation of the season. To most of them it will be the
first machine of the kind they have ever seen, and to
a considerable number it may even be a revelation
of something of which they had never heard.
It is certainly a wonderful age of scientific research
and mechanical invention which has brought about a
trip across the continent in a self-propelling vehicle
within the lifetime of persons who traversed more than
half the distance in ox teams because no other means
of travel were available. The experiences of the new
journey will be vastly different from those of '49,
but in their way will be hardly less interesting. The !
record of them will constitute an important feature of
the hews -from 'this' time on until the wonderful .rip is .1
completed, and the value of the automobile for long ;
journeys over .all kinds of roads has been amply â 
demonstrated. 'â¢ -
NEGLECT OF POLITICAL DUTIES.
A CORRESPONDENT of the Edinburgh Scots
man makes the corruption disclosed in New
York by the Mazet Committee the foundation
for a sermon on "The failure of municipal government
in the United States." The Tammany administration
in New York, he maintains, is no worse than that of
other large American cities, and perhaps not so bad
as that in Chicago, where the citizens were recently
compelled to bring the city authorities to terms by
threatening to lynch 'them.
While the argument is not altogether fair, and the |
conclusions' are such as could be drawn from the evi
dence only by a foreigner, and will not receive the
sanction of Americans, there is much in the article ;
that merits consideration. It is sometimes' worth
while to see- ourselves as others -see us, and that is ;
particularly true with respect to municipal politics, a
department of our public life in .which every intelli- .
gent man recognizes that reform is necessary.
The correspondent of the Scotsman attributes the '
evils of municipal government in the United States
not to our form of administration, hot to' universal :
suffrage, not to a corrupt condition of society, but to
the neglect of the larger portion of the people to pay
due attention to municipal affairs. To that extent, his
conclusions will be indorsed by most Americans
themselves; We may not admit that our cities are ad
ministered much, if any, worse than those of lands
where there is not so much in the way of criticism,
but all will agree there would be improvement if all
taxpayers performed their full share of political duties.
In commenting on this phase of the subject the
critic says there are four classes of people in. American
cities, so distinct as to almost constitute - separate
worlds â "one living on public plunder, another la
boriously devoting itself to altruism, a third attending
exclusively to business, and ? fourth, as everywhere,
floating through life on the wings of pleasure.. But
it is only at election times that the philanthropists,
the men of business, and the people of culture and
leisure take a hand in the game of politics, and then
they prove themselves such novices that the bosses
and their myrmidons lead them whither they will.
Over and over again they have tried independent
movement, but the result has always been either dire
failure or a temporary success followed by a relapse
into still lower depths of municipal depravity. Nor
is the cause of this far to seek. It is to be found in
the complicated machinery which has grown up in
connection with the administration of public affairs,
and~particularly in connection with the choice of pub
lic representatives. The result is to make indepen
dent action next to impossible."
However prone we may be to resent foreign criti
cism, the essential soundness of that statement is not
to be denied. It is, moreover, of timely interest to
the people of San Francisco by reason of its perti
nence to the approaching municipal campaign. Here,
as elsewhere, independent movements have been tried
and have failed. A good government can be obtained
only through an organized party, and in the condi
tions now prevailing it ran be obtained only through
the Republican party. It therefore behooves our citi
zens to bestir themselves at once and make sure of
good nominations on the Republican ticket. The
bosses can be beaten and will be beaten if the tax
payers of San Francisco attend to their political duty
with vigor and promptness.
A Korean mob has wrecked an electric railroad, the
cars of which crushed several children to death. It is
fortunate for C. P. Huntington that human lives are
of less value in San Francisco than they are in Korea,

NEWS OF THE REALTY WORLD.
THERE la very little activity In the
real estate market. No sales of mag
nitude are being made and none such
are In sight* notwithstanding the
claims of a certain class of brokers that
they have a number of good things on the
tapis. They always talk that way, but.
very few of these more or less mythical
transactions ever materialize. However,
there is really no cause for apprehension
as to the future, -as it is conceded by all
responsible brokers that this is the dull
season and until people begin- to return
to town from their summer vacations
there is not likely to be much doing. â 
There is a general feeling among realty
men that the electric road along Sansome
street, which is Included In the corkscrew
franchise, now practically assured, will
mark the dawn of a new era in the whole
sale district of the city. The Market
street Railway Company, in anticipation
of the granting of the franchise, has al
ready begun to lay tracks on that thor
oughfare, and the work will be pushed
to completion with all possible dispatch.
The fact is that this road means practi
cally the rehabilitation of the old whole
sale district. The North Central Im
provement Club, which has taken an ac
tive interest In the franchise proposition,
has been encouraged to continue its ef
forts toward building up this section of
the city. By the first of September - the
work of repaying forty-six blocks in this
district, will be begun, and mother ' im- j
provements of a substantial character
are being . - contemplated or are already
planned by the property-owners. It is ar
gued, and with good reason, that ' when
the trade with our new possessions in the
Orient fairly sets in San Francisco will
experience a wonderful Impetus in busi
ness of all kinds, and the wholesale dis
trict will undoubtedly be principally bene
fited. .--â ;. ,-â '.â  - -.-.":

MORE than a year ago our bet

librettist, developed by the com

everything depends upon the point of
view. There is no castiron law as to
outlook, and this is a record of individual
opinion in the' interest of a great mass of
Intelligent, music-loving people who yet
are not musicians.
The libretto is a . development of Le
Kami's stirring old ballad of the same
name, and thus the structure is not build
ed upon sandâ rather upon the granite "1
a mighty Irish rebel character. Agitation
â¢ runs not in a tiny current, but in a
i mighty torrent,, rushing through three
; acts of riotous energy with occasional
ebbs for a wider flow. The dialogue is
generally good and the atmosphere es
; sentially Irish, though this latter is, we
suspect, due as much to clever stage man
agement as to the intention of the libret
tist". He manages his entrances and exits
with an eye for the picturesque, and cos
-1 tumes his people, most of them, in true
Irish eccentricity. The sullen mutterings
of his trades-union crowds makes us hope
for a bandy policeman. We stand a some
what wondering spectator at the edge
of the fray and give to the two old folks
at the right a special sanction to fight
while there's life. The character work in
pantomime done by these two people,
Fred Kavanaugh and Christie Stock
' mover, is worthy of special mention. They
are* reminiscent of nothing unless it be
the real -thing. "â  .

I but in the field of romantic drama he has
I a great one. We like his voice, but why

LUTZ'S FUNNY STORY.
Judge Conlan Wanted to Hear It in
Court But Was Unsuccessful.
Ernest Grooty, a teamster, was arrested
by Policeman Farley on Market street
Thursday for fast driving over a street
crossing. ; He appeared in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday and Farley testified that
the horse was being driven at a rapid gdlt
and Grouty failed to stop when ordered.
Grooty testified that as be approached
the crossing his friend, Herman Lutz, who
was with him in the buggy, was telling
him a funny story, which occupied his
whole attention, and the horse shied when
the officer ordered a halt and nearly
jumped out of the harness.
The Judge asked- Lutz to take the stand
and wanted him to tell the funny story
so that he would be able to judge as to
whether it was so good as to occupy
Grooty's whole attention. Lutz declined,
but the Judge was urgent, and finally
Lutz said it was about his wife and ha
could not gratify the Judge's curiosity.
The Judge thereupon convicted Grooty
and ordered him to appear for sentence)

About a month ago Mrs. Southworth was

her severity-ninth year, she grew rapidly
worse until a. few days since it was seen
thai death was inevitable. She was at

After some violent scenes in the

At the opening of the Chamber of
Deputies to-day a motion was intro
duced amending the rules so as to allow
i the expulsion of any Deputy causing
i a disturbance. The Socialists vigor
ously protested and violently anathe
mized the movers. .
M. de la Nanthcere, Rightist, defend
ed the proposal, and delivered a caustic
â¢indictment of the Socialists, who inter
â  rupted htm by whistling, hooting and
! banging their desks.
When quiet was restored the Social
j ists drew moving pictures of the vii
I tints of the. repression lying wounded in
. the hospitals and demanded co â¢ know.
1 who was responsible for such "unjusti
fiable horrors."
The Premier replied: "It Is 1 who
caused the strength of the gendarmerie
to be increased on legal requisitions
made before the. repression corn
ed."
This statement drew forth a storm
of invectives and Socialist cries of
"murder!" Subsequently several of the
i Deputies appealed to the Government
to be conciliatory, whereupon the Pre
mier expressed the strongest desire for
, conciliation and said he was prepared
to seek to that end. The statement was
greeted with applause, in the midst of
which the session was ended. The So
cialists left the House together, and
M. Van den Velde, after receiving the
i permission of the police, addressed the
| crowd outside, informing them of the
Ministerial statement.
It is believed the Premier's declara
tion will appease the public. During
â  the night stones were hurled at the
. windows of the Premier's residence,
j the porter of which was hurt, and blood
j was smeared on the pavement in front
! of the house.
About 10 o'clock this evening a great
! Socialist procession, headed by, the So
â  cialist Deputies, paraded the street-
I singing and shouting.. When the Grande
Place was reached the demonstrators
I cheered Burgomaster bails, who ex
; horted them to remain orderly. No ex
! cesses. were committed.
i At a meeting this evening convened
by Van den Velde the Abbe Deans, a
! Christian Democrat, congratulated the
j Socialists on the success they had
i achieved and predicted the advance-
I ment. of universal suffrage. Two thou-
I sand persons accompanied the speaker
to a train, singing the "Marseillaise.'".
In view of the pacific declarations in

Advice.
An opinion of vital importance to the
taxpayers of this State was handed over
to the members of the Board of Equaliza
tion by Attorney General Ford yesterday
afternoon, it contained a clear exposi
tion of the law governing the taxing of
rolling. stock and outlined the duties of
County Assessors in the matter. Deem
ing it of interest, not only to the county
officials ' but the citizens of the entire
State. The '"ill publishes it. In full. Fol
lowing is the opinion:
SAN FRANCISCO. Cal.. June 30.1809.
Mr. C. M. Cogian; Secretary State Hoard
of Equalization, Sacramento, Caiâ lÂ»eai
Sir i have just received your communi
cation of the 29th Inst., which is In worus
and figures as follows, to wit
It is desired by the State Board of
Equalization to get your opinion on
the following matters. The board is
informed that then are several corpor
ations operating rolling stock over the -
railroads of this State and doing busi
ness in lines as follows:
First Kefrigerator cars for the
movement of truit, meat, etc.
Secondâ Oil cars, such being tank
cars for shipment of oil.
Third Beer cars for the shipment of
beer. - . '-â  â "â â¢'" ','â 
Fourthâ Ordinary freight cars rent
Into this State by foreign railroad com
panies and retained here for domestic .
FifthâStock cars used for shipment
tof race horses, etc.
The first of these classes are cars
principally belonging to Illinois cor
porations, such as Armour s, Conti
nental Fruit Express and others, and
are sent to this State by thousands
and placed on sidetracks, subject to
the. order of agents for shipment of
fruit to Eastern points, and they are
used for such purposes.
(Agents in this Stat.- for these cars
claim that they are owned in the East
and pa v taxes there.)
The second class are owned and used
both by foreign and domestic corpora
tions ("other than railroad), such as
the Standard Oil Company, shipping
oil into the State, and the Union Oil
Company of California, the latter prin
-cipallv shipping oil to points in this
State.' but probably also some other
States.
The third class, beer cars, have been
principally used by local breweries and
have been assessed by some of the
County Assessors, notably in Santa
Clara and San Francisco counties.
The fifth class are owned and used
mainly by individuals or firms, (not
corporations) for handling their pri
vate stock, and in this county (Sacra
mento), owned by .1. B. rjaggin, used
for shipment of colts to the Fast for
sale and have been assessed by local
Assessor.
' The heard would like the opinion
segregated as above on each of the
matters enumerated as to whether it
is the duty of the State Board to as
sess any of the above property, and
it' bo, by what authority, and to whom,
and further, to. which counties it
should be apportioned; or whether it
is the duty of the County Assessor of
the county in which such property Is
located or discovered on the first Mon
day In March to assess the same as
personal property and collect taxes
there* â¢ .
In reply I have this to say: The consti
tution of the State of California, article
XIII, section 10, in so far as applicable
to this inquiry. is as follows: .-
Section 10. The franchise, roadway,
roadbed, rails and rolling stock of all
railroads rated in more than one
county in this State shall be assessed
by the State Board of Equalization.
The Political Code, section 3628, reads as
follows:
Section 3628. The franchise, roadway,
roadbed, rails and rolling stock of till
railroads operated in more than one
county in this State shall be assessed
by the State. Board of Equalization,
as hereinafter provided for.
The Political Code, Section 3665, reads
as follows:
3665. The State Board of Equaliza
tion must meet at the State Capitol
on the third Monday in July, and con
tinue in open session from day to day,
Sundays excepted, until the first Mon
day in August. At such meeting the
board must assess the franchise, road
way, roadbed, rails and rolling stock
of all railroads operated In more than
one county. Assessments must be
made to the ration, person or as
sociation of persons owning the same.
From the above provisions it appears
that the roadway, roadbed, rails and roll
ing stock of ail railroads operated In more
than one county in this State shall be
assessed by the State Board of Equaliza
tion. â¢ â¢ 'â¢'â¢'â¢-.. 'â '.â â  - â¢ ' .
The Political Code, section 3628, after
referring to railroad, as above mentioned,
contains this'language: \ :
â¢": 'â¢ ; All other- taxable property shall be
assessed In the county, i city or city
and county, town, township or district
In .which .it is situated. 7 The As
sessor must, between, the first Mon- .
days in March and July of each year.
ascertain the names of all taxable in
â  habitants, and all the property In. his
county subject to taxation, except
such as is required to be assessed by
the State. Board of Equalization, and
must assess such property to the per- j
son by whom :it was owned or
claimed, or In whose possession or con
.-â¢ trol it was, at 12 o'clock meridian of
.'the first Monday- in March next pre
-* ceding. ;,-'/..
The constitution of the State of Cali
fornia, article XIII, j section 8, provides
as follows: ' â¢ 'â¢ "
Section 8. The Legislature shall by
law require each taxpayer in this
State to make and deliver to the
County Assessor annually a statement

from each person a statement under

real and personal property owned by
such person, or in his possession or
under his control at 12 o'clock me
ridian on the first Monday in March.
Such statement shall be in writing,
showing separately:
1. All property belonging to, claimed
by or in the possession or under the
control or management of such per
son. Ss&sagp

erty is situated or in which it is liable
to taxation, and
The Political Code, section 3641, pro
vides:
.3641. The property of every firm and
corporation must be assessed in the
county where the property is situate,
and must be assessed in the name of
tie firm or corporation.
The statute of May 17. 1861 (Statutes
1861, page 419, sections 13 to 15 inclusive),
contains similar provisions to the code
provisions quoted above, and in consid
ering the statute of IS6I the Supreme
Court said, in People vs. Niles, 35 Cal.,
282: - â  â¢ #
From these provisions the intent iB
clear to render all personal property
taxable In the county in which It is
situated, between the first Monday in
March and August, except money or
gold dust, which may, at the option
of the owner, be taxed In the county
in which he resides; and it follows
therefrom that personal property, ex
cept money and gold dust, for all the
purposes of taxation, is to be consid
ered like real estate, as having a situs
of its own, independent of the domi
cile of the owner. I
The rule in the above rase was affirmed
in the case of San Francisco vs. Lux, M
Cal., 494-5. ' , . T
In the light of the above provisions 1
will now answer, seriatim, the questions
contained in your communication:
1. Refrigerator cars owned by persons
or corporations (not railroad corporations
or engaged in railroad business), are to he
assessed by the .County Assessors.
2. Oil ears, owned by foreign or do
mestic individuals or corporations (other
than railroad., are to be assessed by the
County Assessors. â .
3. Reer cars, for the- shipment of beer,
owned by local breweries or by persons
or corporations (other than, railroad), are
to he assessed by the County Assessors.
.4. Ordinary'freight cars, owned by rail
road Companies, domestic or foreign, are
to be assessed hv the â¢ State Board of
Equalization, irrespective of the use to
which such cars are placed.
5. Stock cars, used for shipment of race
horses or owned by persons or corpora
tions .other than railroad), are to be as
sessed by the County Assessors.
In each of the above classes which are
to be assessed by the County Assessors,
the property will be assessed the same as
any other personal property, as provided
by law. -.;': v ."-"'-".'â '/ -.
The class above mentioned to be as- ;
sessed by the State Board of Equalization j
will be assessed by th? hoard in the same ,
manner as other rolling stork .owned by j
i railroads), in the manner as provided by :
law.
The fact that any of the above property
is taxed in other States is no reason why |
such property should not be assessed for ,
and pay taxes in this State for the rea- j
son that the constitution of the Mate or
California, article XIII, section 1. pro
vides: Â -Â . \
Section 1. All property in this State,
not exempt under the laws of the
United States, shall be taxed in pro
portion to its value, to be ascertained
as provided by law. * * *
This the Legislature has done, as pro
vided in the sections of the Political Code j
above quoted. â  â _ _ _
In the case of Ma rye vs. B. & O. R. X..
127 V S 117-123, the Supreme Court of
the United States lays down the follow
ing rule: .
It Is not denied, as it cannot be,
that the State of Virginia has rightful
power to levy and collect a tax upon
such property use.] and found within
Its territorial limits, as this property
was used and found, it" and whenever
it may choose, by apt legislation to
exert "its authority over the subject.
It is quite true, as the situs of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad com
pany is in the State of Maryland, that
also upon general principles, is the
situs of all Its personal property, but
for purposes of taxation, as well as
for other purposes, that situs may be .
fixed in whatever locality the prop
erty may be brought and used by, its
owners by the law of the place where
it Is found. â 'â¢â â â¢â _

In Hein'hart vs. McDonald, 76 Fed. Rep.,
404. the court says:
The claim of exemption from ;- taxa- .
tion of the property described in the
complaint is based on the following
grounds: First, that the property is
engaged In interstate commerce; sec
ond, that its situs is New Mexico,
where taxes on it have been paid;
third that the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad Company is not the owner
of the railroad, and. under the con
stitution of the State of* California.
the rolling stock ran only be assessed
to the owner of the railroad.
The first two grounds are answered
be the cases of Mary- vs. Railroad
Company, supra, and Pullman Palace

TIREY L. FORD.
Attorney General. -_â 
By WILLiaM M. ABBOTT. .
Deputy Attorney General.
T O. Toland. a member of the Board ;
of Equalization from the Lps Angeles
district, gave the following views on the
opinion: read the opinion of the Attor
â¢l have read the opinion of the Attor
ney General on the subject of trie sys
tem of the various kinds of cars other ;
than cars and rolling stock of railroads
owned by and assessed to railroad com
panies in this State, in the regular course
Â§y the State Board of Equalisation.
"It is clear that it is the opinion of the
Attorney General and is doubtless the
law that the only other class of cars
which have, not heretofore been assessed
by the State Board of Equalization and
which ought to be assessed by our board
are regular freight cars of companies ,
organized and operating in the Eastern
Stftes which send their cars into Cali
fornia* loaded with freight and permit '
{hem to be here during the assessment
timâ¢ The State. Board of Equalization
wm make every effort to ascertain what
cars of this character were in the state
of "'California subject* to assessment on
the first Monday in March, and to assess
th m attention of the public has been '[
verT much engrossed recently by the con
sideration of the question of the taxation
o 'the refrigerator cars. Belonging to
hat class are ollcars, beer and stock cars.
I? is clearly the opinion of the Attorney
General that these cars must be assessed
by the County Assessors, for the reason
that they do not come within the desrrip
lion of property which under the consti
tution and statutes of this State may and ;
mis be assessed by the Board of Equali
sation, namely, they are not the rolling,
stock of railroads operated in two or more
counties of this State. The difficult*, if
any? that Shall be found to exist in the
assessment of these cars will lie in deter-;
mining where they are in fact orated .or. |
in the language of the opinion, where
their 'situs' was on the first Monday in
March.. . ''
"A member of the Board of Equaliza
tion yesterday telegraphed a County As
sessor to ascertain whether or not certain
cars which In the contemplation of the
Attorney General's opinion ought to be
assessed by a County Assessor were as
sessed in his county, his county being that
in' which the company owning the cars
has its principal place of business and its
largest output of material handled by
these cars, and received the, reply that ;
none of them are so assessed and that the
company claims that the cars are not
located 'in that county. The question I
naturally arises, Where are those cars
located If not . in that county? This I
apprehend will be the main difficulty of
County Assessors in assessing these cars,
namely, to determine where their location
was on the first Monday in March. It
will certainly be necessary for them to be
very diligent and determined in their ef- I
forts to establish the location of these |
cars otherwise they will be told by their :
owners that they have no location in one j
county after another until it shall result .
as a practical fact that they . have no !
location anywhere, and will â¢ therefore ;
escape assessment and taxation as hereto
fore. H_*&4
"These remarks apply equally to every
class of cars referred to in the Attorney |
General's opinion, and it would seem that
the only course for the Assessors of the j
State to pursue is to ascertain what cars
were in their several counties at noon on
the tirst Monday in March and assess
such cars there. There will be some dif
ficulty In getting this Information at this j
late day, but it can be had by taking
proper steps. The companies and persons
owning the cars can be examined under
oath as to their whereabouts at noon on .
the first. Monday of March, and if they
do not succeed in securing the required j
information from these sources, they can ;
certainly obtain It from the railroad com
panies on whose tracks the cars were at
that time, because it is well known that i
it is necessary for each railroad company
to keep an accurate account of all cars
on its tracks at all times, and from these :
accounts the whereabouts of any car by
number ran be ascertained for any day. j
"A County Assessor by applying to the
agents at the several stations in his coun
ty can ascertain what cars were on his j
Sidetracks on the first Monday In March, ;
and I see no reason why any railroad
company should make any objection to j
permitting and authorizing its agents to
furnish this Information fully . and j
promptly. -.-. *-.--- "
"It is a matter of interest to every tax
payer in the State that property that, has
heretofore escaped taxation and in fact
all property that Is subject to taxation
should be placed upon the rolls and be
subjected to its share of the burden of
State, county and district taxation.
â¢If Assessors do not succeed in getting
all of this property on their rolls by the
first Monday in July it can nevertheless
under the provisions of section 3651 of the
Political Code be placed upon the rolls
while the County Boards of Equalization
are in session, between the first and third
Mondays in July. The section referred to 'â 
authorizes the Assessor during the ses- |
sion of the County Board of Equalization j
to assess any taxable property that has
escaped taxation or to add to the amount. ]
number or quantity of property when a â 
false or incomplete list has been rendered.
But notice of five days in this case must
first be given to the party who is to be
assessed anew or whose assessment Is to
be changed as authorized by this, sec
tion." â  *.. 1
EPWORTH LEAGUE
CONVENTION IS
IN BIG DEMAND
Great Effort to Have
â¢ It Held Here.
COMMITTEES HARD AT WORK
â Â« â
LOS ANGELES AND THIS CITY
WORKING IN HARMONY.
Local and Southern, Delegates to
Make a Determined Fight to
Win the Prize for
California.
An earnest endeavor is being made to
secure the next meeting of the Epworth
League biennial international convention
for this city in 1901. . That great body is
to meet in the city of Indianapolis, Ind.,
next month and commits from this
city and Los Angeles, reinforced with let
ters of Invitation from Mayor Phelao, the
Chamber of Commerce, Produce Ex
change, Board of Trade, Board of Super
visors and other municipal, organizations
of both cities, will be in attendance and
make every effort to secure the prize" for
this State.
Although San Francisco and Los Ange
les representatives are desirous of having
the convention hold its session in their
respective cities they will, however, jour
ney on to Indianapolis and work in har
mony In the hope of securing the next
meeting for the Golden State, In the
event that the Western delegates are
successful it will be left to the board of
control of the three branches of the
Methodist Episcopal church to decide
which city will have the honor of wel
coming the Epworth. Leaguers.
- On Jul} 10 and 13 fifteen delegates will
start for the Hoosier city. They will be
laden with literature describing the beau
ties and resources of the State and 20.000
badges with "California in 1901" .printed
on them, for distribution among the dele
gates to the Indianapolis convention.
Key. W. W. Case, D.D., Rev, J. N. Beard,
D.D., Rev. Thomas Filben, Harry Mor
ten. T. B. Hutchinson. \v . H. Wast.-.
Lewis Norton and Robert Coynes will
compose the local delegation and the City
of Angels will send Rev. F. M. Larkin,
Rev. J. 11. Knickerbocker, Mr. and Mrs.
W. H. Fisher, J. H. Wliittington and
Nathan Newby as its delegates.
On their arrival in Indianapolis the
California detachment will take up head
quarters at the Dennison .and the State
House and begin their labors. It is also
their intention to erect a large tent in
State House Square and there exhibit the
luscious fruits that grow so abundantly
In this State. Visitors to its inviting con
fines will be rewarded with cooling tem
perance beverages and souvenirs. Sterl
optlcon views and lectures will form an
important part of the work of the Cali
fornia delegation. The latter will leave
this State imbued with the importance of
their undertaking and are confident of
success. .
In a communication sent to interested
parties the committee of arrangements
has called attention to the fact that the
expenses for preliminary work and a
California exhibit will be met by the local
leagues of this city and Alameda County;
but It will be essential that the committee
be in a position to give assurance that the
necessary expenses of the convention,
amounting to about $25,000, shall be met by
the business community. Other cities
competing have made the required pledge.
Los Angeles is in the field as against San
Francisco, and back to its local commit
tee are the Chamber of Commerce and the
business people generally. Denver is in
the same advantageous position and the
local committee feels that it must make
a shewing of financial backing to win the
Prizf-
The coming of this great body will mean
a convention similar to the great Chris
tian Endeavor gathering of 1597. but in all
probability much larger. It is expected
that thirty thousand or more people will
be in attendance and such a throng will
certainly be beneficial to the city. A com
mittee will call upon merchants In a few
days for a conditional subscription to as
sist in the enterprise, no part of which
shall be payable unless every condition is
met.
On Monday evening next the following
representatives will meet here and fur
ther instruct the delegates to the conven
tion on the best means of conducting their
campaign: Rev. Thomas Eill.en. C. B.
Perkins, Robert Husband, "W. H. Waste,
and Miss S. E. Power of San Francisco,
and Rev. F. M. Larkin, W. H. Fisher and
wife and J. 11. Whittington of Los An
geles.
Confession of a Millionaire.
A millionaire confessed the secret of his suc
cess In two wordsâ hard work. He said he
put In the. best part of his life in gaining dol

get back health. Nothing equals Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters for restoring health to the
overtired body and brain. It gets at the start
ing pointâ the stomachâ and overcomes ner

(â¢raise- up the Sacramento 'Elver began
last Saturday. â¢ â¢Commodore A.. M. Clay's
sloop Pactolus -was accompanied by E. N."
Walter's s'oop Em-bla and H. S. Pratt's
â¢ yawl Idler. The yawl managed to get
â¢through the- famous Devil's Reach, but
when the other boats were unable to fol
low her, came back and rejoined them,
after attaining a point only eight miles
distant from the city of Sacramento.
A "member of the California Yacht Club,
John T. Carrier of Alameda, has for some
months past been building a keel sloop.
She Is nearly ready for her spars and will
be in the water in about three weeks.
She Is a good' roomy boat, with plenty
of power, and is beautifully built. Her
dimensions are 37 feet, over all, 29 feet on
the waterllne, and she has a draught of
five feet. Her ballast is carried outside.
Harry W. Brydges being unable to secure
time for yachting, has sold his sloop
Hope to T. Turnbull, who will' change
I her name to Daisy. She started on' an
up-river trip last Sunday and returned on
â¢ Thursday.
The schooner Frances, the flagship of
the' Encinals. will leave Saturday for
Napa and will arrive at Vallejo in time
to meet the yachts engaging in festivities
Tuesday. Commodore James S. Hanley
will have' as his guests Dr. Charles L.
Tlsdale. John F. Ward. Hervey Darne.il.

.Interests.
The sportsmen "of Mendocino â¢ County
have taken a firm stand in .the matter of
preserving game from the .onslaught of
market shooters and others who .disre
gard' the laws. They raised a fund, re
cently to be expended in the employment
of a game warden, deputized by the Sher
iff, to watch for persons violating the
law. He had hardly assumed his duties
when he arrested a man with venison in
his possession.
The culprit was fined $30. On Monday
he arrested two men who had in their
possession nine hides and 200 pounds of
meat. .They were fined $40 each. If the
Genuine sportsmen throughout the State
ollowed the example set by the' Mendo
cino people the laws would he respected
and the game would thrive.
A. M. Shields has challenged Otto Feud
ner for the Olympic challenge handicap
medal which the latter won from Dr.
Barker two weeks ago. The trophy must
be defended five times before becoming
the property of any man. The handicap
will be announced on the. Ingleslde field
to-morrow. It Is "expected Feudner will
shoot at twenty birds from the thirty
yard mark, while Shields will be allowed
twenty-two birds .and" will . stand at.
twenty-eight yards.
The members of California Wing Shoot
ing -.Club will meet to-morrow at Ingle
side. Ip to the. present time Feudner has
killed forty-seven out Of forty-eight birds
at. which he baa shot. 'C. c.-. Norman

The gallery gods were true- to their Idol,

point of retiring many times. Dahl
opened proceedings with a resounding
whack on Vickers' body., The. sound had
hardly died away when Vickers landed.,
sending Dahl to his haunches with a thud
that seemed to shake the building. . -
In the seventh round Vickers went at
his man viciously,- but Dahl fought .back
and soon slopped ids gallop. There were
occasional flashes of. fighting in -the last
three rounds, but both men- were too tired
to do - any execution. ..; Billy Madden
awarded the bout to Vickers.- .".-.,' V f

BILLY SMITH AND
M'KEEVER FIGHT A DRAW
NEW* YORK, June 30.â "Mysterious"
Billy Smith of this city and Charley Mc-
Keever of Philadelphia met at catch
weights before the Broadway Athletic
Club to-night and fought a twenty-round
bout to a'' draw. Smith was a trifle the
heavier; but McKeever administered the
most punishment. In the opening rounds
very little was done, except that in the
second McKeever,-. In reply, to a kidney, j
punch; put a mouse over- Billy's left' eye.
Smith forced the fight for the next four '
rounds; trying. to get his right over]
the neCk, but- was 'careful" and unusually
clever. A hot mlx-up in the seventh"; with !
Smith "forcing, brought about" a hard ex.- ! .
change of letts on the face,. Smith boring
in with his left to. the -body. McKeever
came back with a- straight left which cut-
Billy's damaged eye. Smith bled copious-'
ly and when" he went to his corner it took
all the exertions of his seconds th stop
the flow. I Smith came up In the tenth :in
such a vicious. manner that by a too free ,
use of his elbow he incurred, the displeas
ure, of- a good many of the spectators.
From this to the end of the twentieth
round there was little to choose between
the men. McKeever was fast and clever,
landing his left frequently to the face; j
but Smith countered these with left hooks
to the neck and hard right wallops oyer j
the kidneys. Â° -â - = ; Â°

of the'- glands- of .the two 'Japanese picked

could in -any way lead to' . further infec-i
tion,. leaving. only the; germ", specimens 1
which- Dr. Barbat had secured and which ,
he had rendered harmless : <.= -â¢'
.â¢â  With- this report as ;C basis* : the .board,
decided to take -no chances â¢There was j
a great- deal of talk over the matter ââ¢-, but
the result' of. ,it all was that the Nippon.
Ma'tU; would have' to leave' her .dock. and. |
be fumigated in* the stream to the satis^
faction, of the State authorities or there â 
, would.-' be' trouble. ;â¢â¢ The .State: laws must:
be .complied' with or. every man. connected .
with . or' concerned in the disobedience i
would bo placed, under arrest was the i
dictum - of the- board. "'â¢ . â¢; : - : V-'-"' .': -v. '.: ",'â :
' Chalmers, the retiring .quarantine,
officer-, and Dr. Odin, his successor, de- j
scribed how they had .been treated when
they. went out' to the. Marti- to perform
their duties. c . They had been warned not
to land on the island andnot to. go aboard I
the ship, and "the penalty for disobedience !
-was. fifteen days Jn quarantine. Dr. Chal
mers vowed that so far as he was offi- I
cially, concerned he was not even aware
that the Maru had arrived in port. He had
not been notified of the number of pas
sengers." the number of her crew, of tho
cases of sickness nor of the state of her
bill of health. In fact, he knew nothing
of her, although his duties required that
he know everything. He had demandei â 
all the Information he was required to get,
but the officers of the vessel had refused
to give him any facts regarding the ves
sel or her people. Dr. Conn supplemented
his statement with the fact that he had ;
seen at least one man whom he had 3een j
working among the effects of the infected, I
vessel's cargo on Kearny street in this i
city, and he gave further instances to
show the quarantine was not as strict I
under Federal methods as it might be -' '
When the vessel docked at the Mail
wharf Dr. Chalmers ordered her into, the
stream again on the ground that she had i
not passed the State quarantine. The i
first officer, who was then in command,
refused to move the steamer except by- >
order of the captain. Chalmers then
called for a guard of police, and. when it j
arrived the order was given that no per- I
son or thing should be landed from the (
vessel. The gangway was hauled up and
the boat remained in that state all night, i
It was expected that H. R. E. Espey
attorney of the company, would be on
hand at the meeting, but he did not ar
rive until after the gage of battle had !
been flung down and the board had de- |
cided the steamer must "%o into the I
stream. When he did comer, however the '
board convened again and for half an
hour held a secret session in which Mr !
Espey was told what his clients had to
expect. He was informed that there was 1
no gainsaying the authority of the State '
and the vessel would have to conform to i
what had been ordered. He asked whit
the board would be satisfied with and
he was told a trip into the stream and I
a thorough fumigationâ one to the satis
faction of the State authorities. lie
asked how long that would take, and
was notified it would be at least forty
eight hours. His only answer was that i
he would lay the matter before the com- j
pany. Later on Captain Anderson, rep

ALAMEDA, June 30.â Dr. C. C. J.
Wachendorf, who is charged with the
murder of John Kehlenbeck in San Fran
cisco, was until about a month ago a
resident of this city. He was arrested
as a vagrant about June 1. but. the po
lice concluded he was crazy and let him
go. Previous to this he had been "work
ing" the local physicians for small loans
by displaying an assortment of creden
tials and diplomas. He spent all he could .
get for cocaine and morphine. After the
police arrested him and turned him loose.,
the Salvation Army extended him a help--,
ing hand and for a time he showed signs :
of reforming. The army then assisted,
him to get a start in San Francisco and.
he left Alameda. . , : < ..:.......> -

' NEW -.YORK. June 30 ( â Bradstreet's financial
revle.-.y to-morrow will say: Although the
transactions at the -Stock Exchange, were not
large, this week's market has been: far from
dull. Nor, while the speculation has bee t0 a
very large .tent professional and manipulative
â in .origin.- has it lacked decided features of
strength. There has; in fact, been evidence's of
renewed public, buying, and the large purchases
of â¢ American .stocks â¢ In : London . and foreign
takings in our own market have been, a notable
feature. The latter, indeed, were 'sufficiently
large to cause a drop In exchange rates and
for a time to' create, a belief that th gold
export movement was at an end. This idea
was not, substantiated; as the inducements still
offered by the Bank of England and Paris and
Berlin mark resulted in gold shipments this
â¢week to the. amount of $3,000. â "'. -raising the
total since -the movement began early in June
to ? 15. 000, 000. . Neither the continuance of th*
gold exports nor the extraordinary amount in
dividend- disbursements seemed, however, to
affect the money market unfavorably. The only
result of the unavoidable disturbance of loans
Incident to the matter was a temporary- ad
vance in call" loans rates on Thursday and Fri

impressed bvthe prospect â of ' continued ease
In money and by the, accompanying outlook for
an extremely large demand for income-yielding
Securities, growing' out of the desire to re
invest a part' of the July Interest payments*
it- Ist recognized' that- the actual demand from
this source has been to a certain extent an
ticipated. Speculative interest, however, seemed
to consider It something to discount, and the
activity of manipulative operators on the bull
side may be tracked not only to the fact that
a considerable short account had grown up
which could he forced to cover, but to a dispo
sition to take advantage of the prospective in
crease [â the public's participation in the mar
i ket. The fact that much better accounts of
. the progress and results of the crops are now
: heard was naturally calculated to diminish the
! bearish feeling which the street had developed
in the past month. This,' however, was much
less effective as a speculative factor than the
prospect of important deals involving the Van
' derbilt railroad properties: Rumors that some
i thihg- of this kind would come out had been
I heard for several weeks past and It was thought
that he passing of the semi-annual dividend
by the Lake Shore and other companies would
involve agreeable surprises. But neither the
semi-annual statements nor the., dividends of
'.the Vanderbilt companies bore out such antici
-1 patrons and" the speculation' was about to fall
; back on the old story of a probable arnalgama
l.'tieh' "of. the Union Pacific with the Vanderbilt
' system. At Oils juncture came the statement
! that '* propositions'- for the acquisition of The
"Boston and Albany by the. New York Central
I had -been formulated and practically agreed
i upon. The- absence of explicit denials , seemed
I significant, and giving, as it. -did, support to
j their /circulation- of renewed rumors â¢ of in
' creased -dividend payments by the '.Omaha and
'â of. further important ' deals'-. under Vanderbilt
1 auspices, stimulated a buying movement In
1 that group- of stocks, with rapid advances In
New York Central and its companions. Lon
don .'purchases : contributed, effectively to this
movement^ the action of â¢ the foreign market
being the more significant because of- the
Trans 'complications: The sensitive condi
tions of the Berlin and London money markets
! arid other circumstances resulted in. heavy and
; dull speculative-conditions abroad, apart from
1 the American department.

I hnd the half year closes with the- commercial
j and â¢ financial community; contemplating very
' satisfactory returns. . in the ' recent past and
rnr.nifestimr a tone of cheerful confidence re
'gardihg'the outlook .for the last half of 1599.
j in ; the .volume of business done the first half
j of 1.<99 will certainly, rank higher than the best
I hitherto experienced, and the notable rise in
prices which was such a feature of the past
spring has '.' me much to reconcile traders to
tiie admittedly small margins of profits which
modern business operations tend toward mak
ing .permanent. Touching this matter it might
be -added that staple prices to-day are in a
majority' rf instances well above quotations
ruling tor: some years past, the general level,
in fact, being the- highest since early in 1893.
In' some. Instances, of "course, notably in Iron
and steel, recent advances have- brought the
level of prices well ' above anything reported
since 1892, though It is to be remarked that
much of the business done in that industry
this sprint was at old levels, the most san
guine .observers in this line having failed to
accurately gauge the real proportions of the
late advances.
That the transportation interests have shared
to a large degree in the business resulting
from several years of large crops and active
demand is proved by the current- good returns,
the best probably reported so far this year, and
: Indicating a progressive gain over all previous
.records for the six months, notwithstanding the
i steadily lowering rates of transportation.
j There is little in the Immediate Outlook that
I can be construed as unfavorable. The iron
trade having finished the most eventful half
year in its history and most of its contracts
; secured at the old prices faces a very good out
i look for the balance of the year at prices which
1 guarantee large profits, providing . adequate
; supplies of raw and partly manufactured ma
terials can be secured. 11 is not unreasonable
to look for some check. In fact, to business in
the metal consuming Industries, owing to the
; scarcity of these materials. One of the latest
; instances of this cited is the serious delay re
i ported to the ship-building Industry, owing to
' the scarcity of steel plates.
I The labor situation has been one of the most
satisfactory features of the half year's busb
, ness, voluntary advances having raised the
compensation of thousands of operatives and
1 labor troubles being conspicuous by their ab
sence until toward the close of the period under
review, when failures to agree upon wages and
: hours In the Colorado smelting Industry and in
: tin plate manufacturing rendered a large num
ber of workmen Idle. in the case of the latter
: Industry, however, the suspension, it is hoped,
will not exceed the usual summer shut-down.
In agricultural lines the outlook, though
somewhat irregular, is In the main favorable.
The smaller yield of winter wheat seems at
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 1, : 1890.
â the present moment likely to be partly made
up for by an Increased yield of corn, and spring
wheat prospects, though impaired somewhat by
too much rain, are regarded â¢as encouraging.
Good weather throughout the country has al
lowed a rather - better outturn In winter wheat
than was looked for earlier, and. general rains
throughout the South, have helped the cotton
crop situation, while rice and sugar have also
measureably improved. The closing week of the
half year finds special strength and activity In
iron, lumber and wool and woolen goods, the
latter industry having at last apparently begun
to share in the prevailing- prosperity. A fea
ture- of interest in this connection is the '.ad
van, prices of fine wools abroad, which
seem to insure, temporarily at least, a foreign
market for considerable high grade domestic
wool. Manufactured fabrics share in- this
strength, but manufacturers are not credited
with "having large stocks of raw material.'Con
fidence in good fall trade is evidenced . by- re
ports coming from many markets of good or
ders already booked, the volume of such busi
ness already varying from 10 to 30" per cent
in excels of last year, which, it may be re
called, was quite a satisfactory one in this
respect.' â¢' "-'-â¢

weekly review of ; trade will say to-morrow:
Failures for the second quarter of 1899 have
been 2080 in number, against 3550 last year.
with liabilities of ' $20,259,000. against $36,602,252

were 4852. against 6766 last year, with liabili
ties of 848.811,000 against $71,246,783 last . year.
Nearly half of the June liabilities are due to
one failure, hot strictly commercial, cover
ing some banking concerns, a promoter and
a railway equipment company, for. $5,136,000, In
essential features a loan and: trust concern.
With it banking failures amount to $6,436,000
for the half year, leaving for commercial
failures $42,275,063. against $67,444,639. last : year.
Manufacturing were $16.900, 000 for the., half

were $23,000,000,: against $32,956,6:6 . la*t year.
The demand for iron and steel seems to have
no limit. Scarcity of pig has, raised the price

others are yet delayed, Prices of pig average
higher than at any other time/Since February,
â¢ 1890 and prices of finished products .higher
than since March. 1891. Billets are hardly ob
tainable lit- and piste orders are. refused quite
largely ' because works' are overcrowded;
sheet mills have much stronger, demand at the
West but less at the East, ' and structural
works report 26,000 tons required in two: new

spite -'of rising prices, astonishes everybody.-
Poke ovens. 17,453 at work, put out for the

Cotton mills are doing well in spite of the

enough to do at current prices. a. id weak spots
in the trade are defended, by the agreement

ranged between 5.794, 52S bushels in 1894 and
9.651.27S in 1896. Beyond question, the farmers
and speculators and elevator-owners. in farm

as much as the old wheat will fetch, although
exports have been for four weeks 8,949,838 bush

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. June -Wheat started with a
degree of /steadiness. that was somewhat start- j
line in. view of the half-desertedness of the pit. j
Liverpool followed closely the decline of the lo
cal market yesterday and both local and north
west â  receipts were liberal to â  a decree that
under ordinary conditions would 1 have caused
weakness. Put shorts showed ft tendency to I
get out of the market over the. coming holidays, 1
and buying by that class of traders sustained
the market at first: September opened a shade
over yesterday's .closing price at 74%@74%0.
This price changed very little for about half an
hour, when substantial support was given the
market by Snow's crop report on the condition j
of spring wheat. This was unfavorable, putting ;
the yield" at under 90 per cent, and reporting !
a good deal of damage from rust and excessive â 
rains/ especially in Nebraska: As spring wheat
prosperity had been one of the leading planks
in the platform of wheat bears for some time
past, news of this class caused a noticeable in- ;
crease in the buying demand and the only time |
during the session caused the market to as- ]
sume some degree Of activity. The price quickly ,
responded to the demand, September advancing '
to 74% c. and holding close to that price as long
as the buying lasted;. which, however, was not
very long. Before noon the market had taken
on the dullness of the ways shown prior to holi- j
days, and from that time on trading was nar- |
row and- fluctuations small. September sold as
low as 73%@73.%c at One time.- hut at the close, ,
had rallied to 74%'574%c, and showed â  some!
steadiness at that figure.
Corn was fairly active and irregular. Septem
ber closed Mi , ,!- higher.
â Oats was. moderately active and Irregular. 'â 
The close was unchanged for. September.
: Provisions were almost at a standstill. Some
Strength was shown at the opening on the
steady hog market, and the demand from pack- j
ers, presumably covering. This demand kept !
up throughout the session. At the close. Sep

LONDON WOOL SALES.
LONDON, June 30.â There was a full attend
ance at the Wool auction sales to-day. The de
mand was strong, especially for. fine cross
bred* and scoured merinos, which brought full
rates. The Continental buyers purchased free
ly fine parcels, but the home trade secured the
bulk offered to-day.. Poor conditioned lambi,
were somewhat neglected. There were frequent
withdrawals â of low greasy cross-breds. The
bales offered numbered 15,546.

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS. \
WHEATâ No amount of bull news seems ca
pable of hardening the Chicago market. Snow's
report, which appears below, . was -decidedly
bullish, but had no appreciable effect. Buying
was light and the market lacked support: The
condition of : the Indiana crop- was given at
17,000.000 bushels, against 38,000,009 last year.
Snow's report says: "No new developments
in winter wheat, though the condition at time
of harvest is reported a little lower than -.vbe
average of June. 1. Crop may not quite reach
the 275,000;000 bushel mark heretofore sug
gested. " . â¢--'.''"--' - .-..-.â¢
"The spring wheat situation is decidedly less
satisfactory. Current reports make the average
condition "under 90, as against nearly 92 on
June 1. Too much rain and a tendency to over
rankness arid rust are reported from Minnesota
and the Dakotas. â¢ .
"In those States the actual damage yet suf
fered is small, but it must be recognized that
the present position of the crop is such that a.
few days of hot weather would result in rapid
and serious loss.
â¢'Nebraska has already suffered severe loss,
the State average being now 20 points lower
than an June ]. â¢ â¢
"The damage is the result of drought of three
weeks In counties south of the Platte and west
of Hastings. This section grows about one
third of the wheat of the State, and during
June .the condition Of thÂ» wheat crop in these
counties dropped from about 85 to under 40. â¢
â¢ "The drought was riot very severe, but the
wheat plant was unhealthy as a result- of too
much rain in. its early history, and it quickly
succumbed to dry weather. The conditions in
the Northwest are, such that, growers there are
fearful /that a little unfavorable weather just
now would bring about the same result.
"Condition of corn In the Western belt while
still low has improved during the past week.
Drought continues In the south and the situa
tion there Is serious. General condition of crop
is hardly above 86, which Is very low for this
date.''-. â â¢â¢-;:-â¢

THE NEW BUCKLEY
COUNTY COMMITTEE
A BRAND-NEW ORGANIZATION
SPRINGS TO LIFE.
The Buckleyites Move to Fine New
Quarters and Perfect Organiza
tion for the Primary
I " i Election Fight.
The Buckley faction of the torn-to
pieces local Democracy gave last night a
complete new Democratic County Com
mittee, and this County Committee will he
an. lmportant factor In the party situation
from date. From now on the Committee
of One Hundred will not be the only wan
derer on the political shore.
Long and careful preparation preceded
this action. The plan was conceived by-
Christopher A. Buckley before he landed
the.-last time, and it has been enthusiasti
cally approved from the start by his po
litical army. It has been kept in mind
during all the weeks which have seen the
organizing and strengthening of Buckley
clubs in all the districts, arrangements
having been made recently for the elec
tion of county committeemen from these
clubs. Such elections were held and the
representatives elected by the clubs met
last night and organized. They were sup
posed to represent the bone. and sinew of
the Buckley Democracy and its district
popularity. " : â¢
Buckle* departed for his Livermore
ranch yesterday, and in the evening the
assemblage met at: the new quarters of
the Buckley Democracy, which were
formally opened last night, the meeting
for organization Celebrating the trans
planting. The new quarters are the whole
Ellis-street end of the Baldwin Annex.
--â¢â¢ The assemblage packed the fig room of
the new quarters. The . approval of the
committee on permanent organization ap
pointed at a preliminary meeting last
Wednesday evening created the following
offices: President, J. .I>. . Sullivan; vice
president, 11. L. Rea; financial secretary,
Harry Kelly; recording secretary, M.
Brady.; treasurer, J. A. DeVoto; sergeant
at-arms, Lawrence J. Cohlon. It.', was
decided to permanently engage the quar
ters then occupied and a small assess
ment was levied. â¢ ' â¢
While the organization was Intended to
be and. will be a county committee rep
resenting the Buckley faction as far as
It may need representation and cohesive
ness, the ostensible purpose of the or
ganization was the defense of the pri
mary law.. Buckley and his followers pro-*
pose to reinforce this defense with attor
neys and there was appointed a commit
tee on legal talent consisting of Samuel
Newman, Thomas Eagan, Charles Mc-
Carthy, Morris Schwartz, John D.. Wha
ley and Dr. G. L. Loryea.
Among other committees appointed was
one consisting of one from each district
club to see Chat the Buckley! tea secured
fair recognition in the appointment of
primary election officers. Dr. C. V. Cross
was made chairman of this committee
and William Douthitt secretary.
The following delegates composed the
county committee last night:

In compliance with a resolution adopted
by the Board of Supervisor? the board of
directors of the Merchants' Association
has held numerous conferences of- late
with representatives of the various tele
graph, telephone and electric light com
panies and the result is. an agreement
signed by the.;. companies to place their
wires under ground as rapidly as possible,
tin- last of them to be buried; within three
years.
In accordance with this agreement. the
Merchants' Association has prepared an
ordinance which -will be presented to the
Supervisors to- day, together with the
agreement signed by the companies and a

ment with the exception of the Mutual
Electric Light Company.
The proposed ordinance divides that
portion of the city to be cleared of wires
into four districts.^ which are so laid out
that Mission street Is reserved for the
use of overhead wires until the last, In
order that the service of the companies
will not be crippled. The first district
must be cleared within six months after
the passage of the ordinance, and em
braces all that section between Montgom
ery, Washington. Sansome, California.
Davis. Sacramento, East. Howard a* '

The police are investigating a myster
j ious robbery which occurred yesterday, j
morning in the Winchester House at 53
â  Third street. Several days" ago B. F.
FUller and wife arrived here- from- the in-
I terior and rented, apartments in the
house.. Puller had two packages' of bills-
| one containing $1700 and the Other. $1500.
'. Before retiring for .the night he placed j
; the packages in his Inside cOat pocket and
| hung the /garment on the bed post. : "
On arising yesterday morning he at |
once searched his coat, and was astound- I
ed to find that the ...precious packages
were gone. He immediately awakened
his wife, and together they searched the
room for the missing greenbacks. Fuller,
suspecting that the' thief had climbed
through the window of their room, thor
oughly examined the fire escape in the
hope of obtaining a cle.W to the culprit.
1 While 'looking down the tire escape he es
pied the package containing $1500 on the.
iron platform of the story below. .He
Quickly secured the money and at once
' notified the proprietor of the house of the \
robbery. A thorough search was then j
instituted for ; the other roil, but without
â¢ finding it.
Fuller was married to his present wife
about a year ago. She was formerly the |
â ' wife of a. barber named Hill. On account
'â¢ of his ill. treatment she claims she was
I compelled to get a : divorce from him.
| Shortly after the decree was granted she ,
j, met. Fuller, Who is almost 'thirty years her
senior, and after a brief courtship they
Were married: The ceremony was per
formed oh the high seas and caused a sen
sation at the time.
Last night Fuller visited police head
; quarters and reported his loss to Captain
Bohen.
After listening to the story, the head |
of tic- detective, department detailed De
tectives Dinan and Reynolds to make a
I thorough investigation, of the robbery
They- lost nor time In visiting, the house
-, and interviewing Airs. Fuller. She cm
i phatically knowing anything about
| the.' robbery, except what her 'husband had i
told her.- â :' 'â¢ j
Fuller, it is said, is inclined to believe |
J. that his -.wife knows more about the rob-
Ibery than she has told. He claims that
j shortly after. i o'clock on the morning of !
the theft . he was awakened by bis wife!
getting out of bed. '
Not thinking anything of the occurrence
he Immediately fell asleep and did not
awaken until, several hours later.
The detectives win, are investigating the
robbery are convinced that the thief, after
securing tin- packages, threw them out
of the window to a confederate, who was
evidently: . standing on the. sidewalk. In
tossing the â  packages, which contained
$151.10 in bills, the thief in the excitement
of the moment dropped it on the plat- :
â¢f form of the fire escape. -.--."'
PROVING ITS CASE
AGAINST MRS. ADAMS
PROSECUTION SHOWS THAT SHE
PURCHASED POISON.
' . " â  -
Drug Clerk Purlenky. Corroborates
: Officer Hurlehy and Conductor
. George T. Cox.. .
That Airs;: Minnie Adams purchased a
three-ounce vial of carbolic: acid from !
the drugstore at the corner of Geary and |
Devisadero streets the night preceding!
the supposed murder Of her infant son,
John . Richard Gray, there is. no doubt.
This fact has been thoroughly established !
during the trial of Mrs. Adams before i
Judge Lawlor.
Yesterday morning Drug Clerk G. p. j
Purlenky, who sold Mrs. Adams the '
poison, took the stand and was the only
witness examined. Although he did not
remember Mrs. Adams' face very well
he was sure from her general appear
ance and clothing that she was the;
woman to whom he sold the poison on the :
night in question. On consulting his
poison register he testified that the sale
was made about 8:55. His register shows !
8:45, but he said that his clock was ten
minutes, slow. It showed that Mrs.
Cr eight on, 325 Point Loboa avenue, was
the name and address given by the pur
chaser. Investigation proved ; that there
Is no such address on Point Lobos avenue
as 325 and that no woman by the name. of
Mrs. Creighton lives on. that street, at
least none has been found. The three
hundred block on Point Lobos avenue Is '
a, vacant block and marks the corner of
Point Lobos and Parker avenues, the lat
ter avenue being the one on which tne
child met its death. ..'':,:
Purlenky also testified that a few min
utes after th,- woman left the store offi
cer Hurlehy, as he has testified, returned
to the store and handed him the label :
from the: bottle, which the officer says
Mrs. Adams tore off and threw on the
ground: This evidence, together with that
of Orlpman George T. Cox that Mrs. I
Adams boarded his car and suspiciously
watched the policeman on the night In
question, is quite convincing that she did
purchase- the poison on '*_at night, her
denial notwithstanding. It is said that
the most convincing proof of Mrs. Adams'
guilt is yet to be- : introduced and the ;
prosecution is confident of a conviction.

. HONOLULU, .Tune - 23.;-About thirty
citizens of the United : States and' resid
ing'"lit the islands" for some, time past have
decided.to find out the status of the land
laws of Hawaii and test the sections" of
the Newiands- resolution applying to the.se
laws. These men form one or two of the
numerous settlement "associations apply
ing, for land In the new tract in Olaa. and
they halve gone .-about the matter in

â¢ . They each ; believe . that they have th,?
right to "squat" on a quarter section of
Unoccupied Government land, anywhere] On
the islands, but as the Olaa tract- has been
surveyed In lot? of fifty acres each, they
consider it better: to take up three of those
regularly, prescribed lots, making . 150
acres, than to haggle over the additional
ten acres and make a. mistake as to the
corner posts. :â¢'â :â  â¢ â¢ â '
The first move was made on Sunday, the
11th Inst.,- when, twelve squatters went On
the land, selected their lots and erected
shacks,, .To-day; there may be double that
number. The houses are of wood, cov
ered with heavy duck, and are thoroughly
waterproof... The new tract looks more
like a new mining camp that has not been'
advertised than a forest jungle.. Furni
ture and cooking utensils are being moved
in and the squatters are ready 1 for busi
ness and will proofed to fit all the re
quirements of the United States, land
laws. They have employed a firm of at
torneys to defend their rights, and one
member: of "the 'firm will probably go to
Washington at the next session of Con
gress to assist in securing the protection
asked for.
With respect to the above President
Dole said:
â¢*"] he alleged squatters have not a scin
tilla of: a show of holding the iand. The
Newiands resolution is explicit on the
point of. the public lands of. Hawaii. Until
special land legislation is enacted by Con
gressâif indeed it ever Isâ Hawaiian laws
apply "to] all lands: in the republic.
"These people probably hope to hold the
land until after Congress assembles, j In
that. even, they will be disappointed, for
the Government has already decider!, and
is preparing to open the tract in ques
tion. In a few weeks the land will be
opened in the regular way under the Ha
waiian laws. If th..- present- squatters, as
they, arc called, . take it up under the
rules, why; I suppose they are as Wel
come to it as â  any one else. But should
they fail to do so they will be hustled out
of the tract. That Is all.
."It is a foolish move. I cannot imagine
who can be advising those people. I cer
tainly hope they, will not risk any money
in their Wild project."

PACIFIC BANK CASES.

â¢Judgment in. favor of the- defunct Pa

followed ; Immediately : upon the collapse
of the bank. The plaintiff sued on a claim

: : him by the McDonalds, but the court held
! that they were illegal and hence gave
Judgment for the bank. , â¢â¢.-;
Judge Seawell also made an order

ald' *â > set aside the purchase made by
the latter of 150,000 shares Of the capital
stock of the Los Angeles Railroad Com
pany. The stock In question was held
originally by a New York bank to .se
i cure a debt owed by the Pacific Bank.
; Subsequently the money was paid and it
â  was released, and later McDonald pur
! chased the stock for himself, paying $75,
--i 000 therefor,': the price being but one-half
I its par value. During the trial to set
j aside, the purchase, Judge: Seawell held
| that the purchase by McDonald was Il
legal, and hence gave judgment for the
plaintiff. The findings were prepared by
the plaintiff's attorney, but when the
' court examined them, he found that there
was an insertion to the effect that the
stock Was worth $150,000. Judge Seawell
had not so decided, although the stock
was worth that money, and â¢ Judge . Sea
well struck ..that- statement, out. On a
second investigation it was found that
the objectionable statement occurred
twice, and as this had riot been called

PROPOSED TAX *. ON'-*
,'-V : :'\ UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
SPECIAL MEETING OF THE
BOARD OF REGENTS TO-DAY.
Governor Gage, Lieutenant Governor
Neff and Speaker Anderson
";'.-.' Will Attend the Session.-
.-.. Regents of .the university at a recent
session of the board resolved to impose on
each student attending the" institution a
registration fee or tax of !"-'. The vote In
favor., of the proposition was not unani
mous. It Is believed that the measure
| would not have received a majority of the
i votes if there, had been a full attendance
of regents:
.; At the request of Governor Gage, there
will be a special meeting of the regents
to-day to consider the advisability of re
scinding the action of trie board in -rela
tion to the tax.- .
:. In preparing estimates for the year be
ginning to-day the regents figured the
amount required for each department of
the university. In estimating the income
to meet the expenses the- regents calcu
lated the amount .that a 2-cent tax on the
assessment roll of 189$-Â»99 would '-produce.
The result of the figuring was a deficit
Of $47,000. In order to raise this sum the
tax on students .was proposed. . l'~i?. ' Â°".
.--. It." is probable- that- the 'â¢ regents ~ here
underestimated "the - sum that will come
to. the university under the two-cent tax.
indications "point, to a considerable in
crease in the State, .tax roll. As the' roll
expands â¢ the:' income- of. ".the university
grows. The .two-cent 'tax' on a -'valuation
of -. $1,200,000,090 .will produce $240,000. -Four
years ago the university - tax ; was. in
creased -from, one to .'two' cents.' Under
the old tax the Income of ,$120,000, was -suf
ficient. :â¢ As soon -as the- double tax was
granted the' .'regents .began. to : increase
j salaries- and spend money, lavishly. "The
' plain, and -simple" remedy to adjust finan
! cial ' affairs of the institution .would .be to
reduce the. salaries of professors^ arid" In
structors, making a provision ' that the
period of reduction should not extend be
yond f*h v vacation season. : There, is .noth
ing in the arti-cle-s establishing- the uni
versity :to prohibit a. redaction of sal
aries. â â¢ Good, "however,, maintain
that a tax on students violates â¢ the law
creating: the .-institution. The sentiment
of the people of the State Is squarely
against the tax on students. " i
; Governor Gags, who arrived from* Sac
ramento last evening,- said he proposed
to attend the meeting of regents to-day.
Lieutenant 'Governor. Nefl and- Speaker
Anderson will -also, attend. It is believed
that the regents will, rescind the tax.
Benjamin Ide -Wheeler, who was , re
cently- chosen president of the university,
has "not signified his acceptance of the
office. A personal dispatch suggesting
that he* on Mrs. Hearst in New York
.was sent to him by Regent Arthur Pledg

received up to a late hour last night.

Irregular Formation of the Modesto
â  â¢;"' District Does Not Constitute a
Valid Answer to the Ac
tion at Bar.
: '; United States Circuit Judge Morrow
| handed down an opinion yesterday to the
I effect that the complaints in the suits of
: George Herring against the. Modesto Ir
j rigation District were sufficient. The mo
tion for a judgment on the pleadings was
J dismissed.
: Herring, an English, capitalist, sued to
recover the value of 117-' Interest coupons
attached to 271 bonds of the irrigation
: district in the sum of $500 each of which j
Herring is the owner, the total sum In- I
i volved being $17,640, with interest. Judge
I Morrow's opinion declares that the fact
I that these coupons are to be paid out
i of. a fund to be raised by the officers of
I the district in a specified manner does
hot impose upon Herring the necessity
jof alleging that the" irrigation â¢ officers
I have failed to perform their duty. It ap
j pears further from the facts stated in the
i answer that the ..iodesto Irrigation Dis
! trict had been exercising the powers of ,
: a municipal corporation openly and pub-
I licly for several years prior to the time
' when the plaintiff became the owner of
' the bonds of the district, and for more
i then ten years prior to the commence
â  ment of this action. In the case at bar, :
j the constitutionality â â¢ of the act â¢ under
' which the defendant was Incorporated as
an Irrigation district has been repeatedly
before the Supreme Court of the State
i and has been held constitutional and |
: valid in every case. 'â¢.
The opinion goes on to say that the
1 defense is not that the defendant was
organized under an unconstitutional law j
but that certain proceedings taken in its j
organization were irregular and Invalid. ,
Whether the statutes of this State relat
ing to the organization of Irrigation dis
tricts as construed by the highest courts
of the commonwealth be considered or
, the general law on the subject as estab
lished by the highest authorities be ac
cepted, the same conclusion is arrived at,
ii iin.-iv. that the matter set up by the
defendant In Its first formative defense
i relating to the organization of the de
fendant as an Irrigation district noes not
1 contain facts sufficient to constitute a de-
I fense to th,- cause of action stated in the \
j complaint. The demurrer to that defense
' will therefore be sustained.
I As the answer denies that the plaintiff
purchased in "ood faith and for value |
I and without notice of their dishonor the I
I bonds to which were attached the cou- :
! pons in the suit, it is clear that this de- |
fense* should not be disposed of on this â¢â 
demurrer. It will be. therefore overruled, j

distance will probably be covered in two weeks
in crosscut ting. The advance of the west
crosscut on the 1800 level to tap th,' ore at that
depth will be observed with unusual interest by
those familiar with the situation and who are
aware that there is a large area of virgin
ground below the 1750. Should this crosscut
demonstrate that the ore on the 1800 level holds
its width and value at that depth a boom in
Comstock share values rivaling that of thirteen
years ago is assured.

The Call yesterday morning-.
i:, ore acting upon: the estimate the
committee listened to. the protests of As
sessor Dodge and City and County At
torney l^ane against the allowance made
for their respective departments. Dr.
| Dodge called . attention : to the estimate
â¢which allows him -$5000 with which to
conduct his office for the first six months
of the fiscal year and $30,000 for the second
half. â¢ â : '
â¢'This holds the office down to the eleven
statutory officers for the. next six months,
allowing nothing for extra* deputies, said
the Assessor, ."For the nasi ten years the
office has employed not less than thirty
live deputies: during the last six months
of the calendar year. It. will require at
the very least $20,000 for me to perforra
the iriecessary work of the office up "â  the
Ist of January.,"-;
The Assessor said he had adopted a sys
tem which he. thought. Would result in a
saving of $15,000 or $20,600 a. year in the
expenses of the office, and he was willing
to stand a reduction of $30,000, but hi- did
not see how 'Â-â¢ could gel along with any
less. The Assessor had to collect a .half
million dollars in poll taxes, and that
alone required a considerable outlay to
gather In. He said he was now working
his deputies day and night and had man
aged to keep $SOO within his allowance,
but If his force was reduced it. would be
impossible to continue the work. . â¢ '--'â *
Chairman Perraull explained that every
member of the board had pledged himself
to keep within the dollar limit. y The
Mayor in his annual mess had called
attention to this pledge and, after two
years' experience in office, had assured j
the Supervisors that by strict economy l
they could easily keep within the dollar
limit, not counting expenditures for public :
Improvements and the payment of de
ficienoief: created under the last boa
"If this levy is not, satisfactory," con
cluded Chairman Perrault, "and Mayor
Phelan can improve upon it, the commit- 1

from him."

The Woman Was Hit on the Head
With a, Bottle, and Blood Poi
soning Is Said to Have
Set In.
Great alarm is felt in certain circles i
..over the condition, of "Trixie" â -Coleman,'.;
the young variety actress who was badly -j,
injured last Saturday night at the 'Tha- ;
lia beer .hail While engaged in a ;dfs- : .;
: graceful row : with another woman named i
| "Dollio" Kc!!'K. .Trlxie Coleman is now '
lying in .a .critical condition at the home.
of Maude liar;--!!, a well-known tender
loin character, and James Schwartz, the ''.
â  proprietor Of the- beer hall, has Instructed J ;
the friends of the. young woman to sup
. press th>> facts concerning Miss Cole- ;
, mail, precarious state. ; '.Instead of hay- I
Ing .been hit on; the head. .With a glass, .
i the Coleman woman, was : struck wirh a :
: -beer-bottle/ The force of the- blow opt ned
, ,a gash; several inches, and. the broken
; glass it.) deep into her scalp .in- dress-:
ing the wound the doctor failed to: re- .
.! move the splinters of glass, and as a re-,
suit ..-.blood! -poisoning : is said to- have set f.
â y a ring; that- the police would refuse to f
grant 'him . a new license -to ..conduct his â¢ .
resort, Proprietor ! Schwartz, .and 7 the [
â .friends of the. young woman, all of whom :
are. employed "by him. have done all in j
their power to hush tip. the matter, When
first taken to the home of: the Darrell ,
â¢''..woman, at T-'lB Hush street. Miss Cole-
I man. was Uncorjscioug, and she remained ; .
iin that condition for vera days. Dr.
Jjibhh,- Who ...occupies .an office a block j
. away from the Thalia, was called in. to | :
attend the 'woman,- and he,, too, was cau
tamed to give out no information as to
\ I where the woman- -was confined or how.
:', .seriously she was injured.
Despite Schwartz' attitude, a few per
., sons employed at the Thalia who - were
: : .witnesses to the row stated yesterday that
| if the Coleman woman's injuries resulted
; fatally they .would divulge certain ugly
: â¢ â â .-which Have thus far been success-
I fully suppressed. ;-â¢â :â¢
The quarrel which resulted .so disas
trously; for the: Coleman womfcn began
over a dispute as to which one was Justly
entitled under the rules of the institution
to profit by the favor of a man who was
- spending .his money . freely in the . plane.
One warm word, brought on another., and
in a; .moment Trixie Coleman and Dollle
Kellog were tangled in wild combat, At
long range they .rained blows on each
other's:. countenance and in the clinches i
they made war .oh "the hank of hair,-'. j
. Trixie Coleman^ possibly because of her
Intimate association with a broken-down |
prizefighter, pro-vied the Kellog woman's
superior. Trixie landed an artistic left
hook on Dollle^,. nose, and fractured her.
nasal appendage in two places. Then the
Kellog woman grabbed a beer bottle and
struck '.Trixie oh the head. ' 'â '
The crowd of waiters and cheap per
formers who had watched the struggle
for supremacy 'between the two women"
became alarmed- at its serious, conse
quences, and they hustled Dollle Kellog,
into another portion .of the: place. The
Coleman Woman was picked up In an tin
conscious : condition and carried into one
of the. back rooms. She was bleeding pro
fusely from a deep-cut In her head, but
â  rather : than have the affair come to the.
r notice' of ; the police Schwartz, who was -
lan interested spectator, refused to â¢allow:
, the woman to he removed to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where she could have been;
! given immediate attention. She was al- :
lowed to lay there unconscious and bleed
ing .until Dr. Holm r arrived:. â¢ .-â â¢â¢
Contrary to general expectation, Dol
: He Kellog has made no attempt to leave
1 town, but since she was informed of her.
i victim's serious condition she has become .
greatly 'alarmed.-:: j

MANAGER WYATT MAD
--; /AT WALTER MOROSCO
COMPLAINS BITTERLY : OF ';* UN
KIND TREATMENT..
The Southern Impresario Says - .He
Received Many Promises for .V
; His Influence, but They .V-V
'_. )-' ; "Were Not Kept. â¢ '.:â¢
According to. information received from
Los Angeles the. reciprocal cordiality, ex
isting between Walter Morosco, impre
sario of this city, and Harry Wyatt. the
, manager of the Los Angeles. Theater, has.
according to the statements, of Wyatt;,
who .oh ., Thursday returned from: the
northern metropolis,', reached the point,.; of
j breaking. Wyatt insists that through his
: influence and upon his representations to
i John Griffin, owner of the Burbank Thea
[ ter; Morosco was able to secure his lease
: ..of the house. In discussing' the subject
he said;:
: : "I. told Morosco I would do this only
after he mudo me a promise and offered
to put.it in writing, that. lie would not
book first-class attractions for the house.
On his pledge I wired Griffin',- urging him
to lease the house to Morose". If. as. rex
ported, Morosco has booked the FraWleys
he has. gone back on his' word and has
done an act of which I never thought
him capable. But for my influence Mo
rosco would never have secured the Burr
bank. When I learned that he had
booked the Frawleys and other first-class
attractions I tried to undo what I had.
done and endeavored to secure the house
myself. I was too late." . , ..'.
In the absence of Walter Morosco. who
is staving at his country home in Fruit
vale, Lewis H. Bishop, financial secretary;
of the Grand Opera-house, yesterday
stated that he was greatly surprised
that any ill feeling should exist between
Mr. Wvatt and Mr. Morosco, .. â â .
â¢if Mr. Wyatt states that Mr. Morosco
booked the Frawley Company, he -is mis-,
taken," said Mr. Bishop. "The Frawley :
Company and a number of other well
known organizations were booked by C.
A. Shaw, who was lessee of the theater
in fore Mr. Morosco secured control.: We
take the Burbank from the Ist" of August
for a term of five years. -Mr... Wyatt s.
[claim that Mr. Morosco gained, the Bur
bank through his Influence is news to me.
"When he came up feb the city he informed
us that the theater, was for rent, and Mr.
Morosco Went down there and secured it.
I don't see where Mr. Wyatt. had any
influence in tthe matter.': There were oth
ers in the field, but. they, failed. â *â  "â¢::'"..;.â¢".â¢:
"It was Mr. Morosco's intention to run
the Burbank as a stock house, but when
he found that bookings had been made
he decided to run it as a combination
house for the season. Whether lie in
tends running if in the future^ as some
thing else remains to be seen." ;..--..-.'
