preat accuracy in the camp of the
Gordon Highlanders and the Man

many narrow escapes. To-day the
snemy resumed the bombardment,
3oing some very effective shooting.
Several of the British guns have been
shattered by the Boer big guns.
QUEENSTOWN. Cape Colony, Sat
urday, Dec. 2. â The Boers have be
come very active in the country
iround Storraburg Junction, to which
Beneral Gatacre was to make his next
move. The telegraph lines have been
rut in various places and communi
cation with Steynsburg, Dordrecht
md Maraisburg has been severed. It
Is believed here that th? Boers have
Decupled Steynsburg. Firing has been
beard in the direction of Stormburg,
probably between General Gatacre's
vanguard and the Boer commando.

"CHARGE OF TUP: FIFTH I.ANVERS."
INCIDENTS OF IHt BATTLE OF ELANDS LAAGTH.
fltn B D.iily Graphic, fr<. tn sketches by sp.cial artists)
conveying some Important massage to tho
Boer leaders from headquarters.
Of all theso rumors thorn Is just enough
substance to some of them to cause a be
lief that the Boers are much worried by
the British preparations for an advance.
The report of General Joubert being suc
ceeded by Schalkburger might mean a
more vigorous campaign on the part of
' the Boers, who have blamed Joubert for
his caution. It lend* color to the report
that Ladysmith Is to ho assaulted. It
may be taken for granted, however, that
'. so lons as the Frere campaign remains
quiescent It is tolerably certain that La
dysmith is not in very great straits. While
there Is communication between Frere
and Ladysmlth by searchlights and run
ner.--, any advance for the relief of the
latter place would mean very hard fight
ing, as it Is known that the Boers have
strongly fortified the hills between Lady
smith and Colenso.
Most contradictory reports are in circu
lation as to the, movements of the Boers
around Ladysmth. Dispatches so late as
i Monday report large numbers of them to
be retiring. It is said a column four miles
' long has been seen departing. Another
message on the same date places Boers in
great strength along the line of the Tu
gela.
Any withdrawal from I.adysmlth would
have two effects. It would weaken the
confidence . of the Boers and enable the
British armies in Natal to unite in one
Imposing whole.
If one strong force of Boers Is moving
off from Joubert'i eoirmond to Drakens
herg passes into the Free State. General
Mothuen will have to face eastward and
meet it. He has about MM men with him
and another 10.000 on his line of communi
cations, but this latter force Is very weak
In cavalry ! and artillery and la spread
out along the railway from De Aar to
Modder River. The fact. that tho Boers
i are not weakening in front of Kimberley is
very important an showing their strength.
Definite news of General Methuen's ad
vance has arrived. The Boers have been
located by the Lancers six miles to the
north in strong position. It is feared that
Methuen will once more have to deliver
a frontal attack. There are indications
that the Boers In that quarter have been
reinforced,
Great efforts are being made to reduce
Maf eking. An additional force with heavy
guns has started to co-operate In the
Biege. There is little hope of relief going
to Colonel Baden-Powell from the south,
which just now \ looks impracticable.
There Is a report of four armored trains
running down from Bulu'wayo.
General Butler's report regarding Boer
losses is very interesting. He takes three
instances to prove. that the enemy do not
i admit one-tenth of the losses they have
incurred. . A'" â â 'â â

MODDSR RIVER. Saturday. Dec. 2.â
Colonel Scott-Turner made a sortie from
Kimberley on Tuesday. November 28. In
the direction of Carter's form. He beat
the Boers back and rushed their laager.
"The last defender. When the
Gordons and the Imperial Light
Horse finally reached the Boer bat
tery they found only one wounded
gunner waiting to receive them."
While leading the final attack Colonel
Scott-Turner was killed. Our total loss
was heavy, twenty-two being killed and
about twenty-eight wounded. No anxiety
is felt here for the safety -of Kimberley.
The Boers are occupying: kopjes be
tween here and Kimberley. They have
received reinforcements from the east. It
is reported that these men have come
from Natal. Kimberley la all right. We
are communicating with the town by
searchlight every night. There are Boer
spies about the camp. Some of them came
in an ambulance wagon with coffins yes
terday. The spies were arrested.
Our engineers are building a new tem
porary bridge over the river, the other
having been destroyed. Some naval guns
with lyddite shells are expected here
presently. Lieutenant Crispin of the
Northumberland h^usileers and one man
have been woundÂ»d on patrol duty.

BULLER SAYS BOER

For instance, at Belmont eighty-one of
their dead wore accounted for. The

GOVERNOR GAGE WILL
CALL AN EXTRA SESSION
Waiting for Sixty-Four Names
to Caucus Agreement.
Burns Touts in the Field With Their Old-
Time Boasts and Claims for the
Mexican's Chances.
WE. the undersigned, in case the Governor calls
an extra session of the Legislature, agree to go
into a caucus of not less than sixty-one and to abide by
the decision of said caucus.
We further apree to adjourn at such a time as the
Governor may designate.
When sixty-four signatures are append
ed tO the- foregoing agreement Governor
Gage will issue the proclamation calling
an extra session of the legislature. At-
semblyman 11. W. Miller of San Francisco
is handling the paper. Speaking to a fel
low-member whose signature he â ought,
Miller said:
â¢I speak by authority when I Â»ay that
an extra session will be called. .Others
have said something of this kind, but I
come from the Governor direct and I
know that sixty-one names had been
signed up to last Saturday night. The
Governor wants sixty-four signatures."
Assemblyman Miller further stated that
the session would be called to legislate on
harbor improvements and street assess
ments. The Governor Is quoted by Miller
as saying: "I will not take snap judgment
on any of the candidates for United States
Senator, but In the. rail for th- extra ses
sion will give all the candidates plenty of
time to organise their forces."
Intense but subdued excitement prevails
among extra-session adherents. The be
lief that the matter la settled so. far as the
calling of the extra â â âInn Is concerned
Is so generally entertained that steps
have already been taken by interested
parties to engage accommodations at
Sacramento.
D M. Burns is an active advocate of tho
extra session plan. He told several of his
friends recently that he did not care to
be appointed United States Senator. Ha
knows that the Legislature which con
venes In regular session In January, 1901.
wlli be called upon to elect a Senator if
an extra session be not convened and a
Senator elected prior to that time. The
appoint nent under the most favorable
auspices cannot give title to the office for
a longer time than one year. Again.
Burns Is fully apprised of the fact that
ho could not secure a dozen supporters in
the Legislature if he were an avowed can
didate for United States Senator before
the pcoplo of California.'" Reasons why
the colonel is not necking appointment are
obvious to the dullest minded politician.
His only hope of securing Senatorial hon
ors, for a term of five years rest In an ex
tra session of the existing Legislature.
The touts who are now boasting in
whispers that the Colonel will win out
expect that success will be gained by
wholesale bribery, corruption and reckless
promises of patronage. They suspect that
the peopleâ the great moral forces of the
Stateâ will be aught ofT their guard, but
they will find before the extra session is
a day old that thÂ» purpose of the honest
people of this State to shield the common
wealth from disgrace has grown stronger
every hour since th.- last session ad
journed.
The .statements freely circulated that
Burns has secured â  sufficient number of
votes to control the proposed Republican
caucus are not warranted by thÂ« facts.
it is extremely doubtful If be baa added
one vote to the strength of his column
since the Legislature adjourned. it is
said that Assemblyman Merrill has been
importuned frequently to promise his vote
for Burns. The story comes to The Call
that Burns Importuned in person, where
upon Merrill rejoined: "The people In my
district are opposed to your election."
Burns replied: "You don't have to live In
your district all the time, Jo you?"
Since Representative A. S. Crowder re
moved from San Diego ' to Spokane,
Wash., the Burns touts have been indus
triously circulating the report that ho no
longer cared for the opinion of thÂ« San
Diego people, and at the extra session
would be found In the Burns camp. The
following dispatch from Spokane effect
ually settles all doubts as to Mr. Crow
dÂ«-r's position He will be on hand and
will stand as true to his colon as when
he was a resident of the southern city.
SPOKANE. Dec. 6.â "1 shall certainly
attend an extra session of the California
Legislature if one is called." said A. 8.
Crowder. representative from San Diego,
who Is now In business In this city. "Will
I vote for Burns Well, during the last
session I led the tight for U. S. Grant Jr..
and know no reason why a change should
be made In my choice BOW."
Mr. Crowder has been here since Octo
ber J. He is at the head of â  large com
pany handling California fruits on com
mission on â  a large scale, and Is also
interested in real estate. A pool Including
U. S. Grant Jr. and other California] has
through Mr. Crowder Invested about 1100,
000 in Spokane real estate recently.
Assemblyman, Huber of Los Angeles Is
claimed by the tout- as a Burns rein
forcement by reason of Grant's retire
men I from the Held. There la some
ground for the Huber claim, as the As
semblyman stated that if hl- vote were
; needed to elect Burns he might throw It
to the colonel, but be did not ay that
Burns would be his choice In caucus.
Positive assurance has been given that
U. S. Grant Jr. Is out of the tig:, and
will stay out. Milton Green, who was
one of Grant's managers, says; "Mr.
Grant's name may go before the caucus
for a complimentary vote If an extra ses
sion hi called, but he has retired from
the content." Mr. Green's help in the
cause of Burns was recently solicited, but
it was not promised. Green has a score
to settle with the touts. It is fresh In his
mind that he was tortured and racked by
the . followers of . Burns, and It Is not
likely that he will permit his persecutors
to escape unpunished. The extra session
its bound to reveal some of the secret in
iquities of the session last winter. The
Call has taken advantage of the era of
peace to lay In a good supply of new am
munition.
It is definitely known that several Re
publican Senators and Assemblymen who
have refused to sign the caucus agree
ment will go Into the caucus to oppose-
trustworthy Boer source shows that at
Hlldyard's fight. November 23.' the enemy
lost thirty killed and 100 wounded. It Is
Impossible to say how far these numbers
are correct, but it is evident th. enemy
does not admit a t< nth of th.. losses suf
fered. Intercepted dispatches to Joubcrt
from a commander show that even the
official dispatches contain decldedlv inac
curate Information lii this respect.'*
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Burns or any other unworthy candidate,
provided an extra session Is called.
Men who have canvassed the field care
| fully m.-l- that Burns is weaker now
I than he was when the Legislature ad
: Journed. Several of his old-time support-
I ers have grown lukewarm and Indifferent.
They did not receive the recognition in
| the parceling out of State nutronaga
, which they had a right to expect. Mora
than one cold hrlck was passed to thÂ«
Burns crowd, and the eh* of the corral
will surely find missing links of sympathy.
If- the extra session Is railed the anti
boss forces of the Republican par- from
all sections of the State will assenMo
at Sacramento to assist In the electMn
of â  clean rran of character and intelli
gence to the- United States Senate. T.lÂ©
anti-Burns forces will unite 'n some rep
utable m.m and the man of their choice
will be tlectcd. The election of D. 11.
Burns would mean the overthrow of th*
Republican party of California in the rÂ«xt
Presidential campaign. Leaders of the re
form forces appreciate tho fact that the
Senatorshlp should be eliminated from
the Presidential contest and they nro
ready to Â«uj>tain In extra session the Mgh
mlnded members of the Legislature, who
saved the Ftat* from disgrace last win
ter. Th- may be others of tho JUson
Wright and Simpson <â â¢ imp. but the crop
Is too small to help th. cause of bostUra
and boodle.
The touts E re boasting that Assembly
man Muenter of San Joaquln is ready to
enter the Burns corral. Tho rail Is as
sured by Mr. Mn.-nt.-r hlmselt that th*
people if Fan Joaquln County are op
posed to ! 'urns' election.
Senator Taylor Is also claimed by thÂ«>
touts as a Burns recruit*. The Idea of tho
Alam- Senator betraying his constitu
ents Is preposterous. He values the re
spect and confidence of his friends uni
neighbors, and will ever be found on the
Hide of morality and derrney.
There will bo a mass-rneÂ«t n * of the
reform forces In Oakland before the fight
is finished, and Senator Leavltt may bo
invited to attend.
ThÂ« corruptlonists. by turtles of o>.
bauchery an.! bribery known to thÂ»
bosses, may secure thirty-two votes for
Burns in the caucus, it may be necepted
as an assured fact that eljrhty-flvr Re
publicans will attend the caucus, and thÂ«
bosses must got forty-three to obtain con
trol. The Judgment of the clearest mind
ed politicians of the State Is that Burns
can never get th. required number
The latest Intelligence * r ,,m New York
is that C. P. Hunting-ton Is resolved to
continue his support of the Mexican \p
peals were recently made to him In behalf
or M. 11. do Young, but he refused to en
tertain th. overtures, although Mr. .]â¦Â»
Young was on the ground to meet him
with an olive branch la hl~ as a flag pole.
Mr. -i. room was at Mr. HuntlngMn's
house la New York from the middle of
the afternoon until nearly midnight. An
he waÂ» about to take hln leave Mr. Hunt-
Ington said to him: "I know that jrpu aro
a good man. Mr de Young. 1 have al
ways known that. Yoti are good enough
for United States Sen.itor. but not tha
right man for this trip."
Before leaving this city for NÂ«>w York
Mr. de Young made known his porpoia
to visit Bpejrer & Co.. the organizers of
the big syndicate which recently pur
chased Southern Pacific strck. He laid
his plans In advance to Interview jh.>
Sptyers on the Senatorial contest In this
State and arranged In the event of suc
cess in reaching for Southern Pacific In
fluence through the syndicate to npprlso
a prominent man hen by telegraph. The
"prominent man" has not yet received iho
! telegram, but privnte litters have been
received which ray that <\ P. Iluntlngtnn
would not consent to the proposed politi
cal deal.
Perhaps Mr. Huntlngton. through the
channels of the law department, may con
tinue to give Burns the moral support of
the Southern Pacific. To this the good
people of California will not demur. All
1 that this State asks In the name of fair
dealing is that the corporation shall with
hold Its Immoral support. If Hunttngr m
knew how the touts cursed him last win
ter for not coming to Burns' aid with
plenty of coin he would understand thÂ«
situation In the Burns corral much better
than Herrtn ever understood it.

ANGLOMANIA LEADS
TO CHURCH STRIFE
Sausalito Congregation Engaged
in a Genuine Terr)pest in a
Teapot Warfare.
SAt'SAMTO. Doc. 6.â The members of Christ Episcopal dwell, which
has enrolled among Its communicants a goodly number of persons belonp
inc to the ultra-fashionable set, lave evidently forgotten the admonition of
th.-ir divine leader to found their faith upon the rock of peace and are en
â¢(1 n the throes of civil warâ a genuine tempest-in-a-toapot upheavalâ
which threatens to necessitate tnc services of Bishop Nichols as arbitrator.
Anglomania Is the cause of the strife, so a majority of the members declare
nnd such Is the antipathy felt by them toward what they roeard as a
mild foim of snobbery that they hr.ye "done politics" in the effort to defeat
the alleged Anglomaniacs.
This wire-pulling m successfulâ only too successful for the sake of har
monyânnd the fashionable set have aired tholr grievances by a proclamation
that they intend to draw the afToir to the attention of Bishop Nichols on ac
cour.t of political methods which 'hey think would have done honor to the
late Bora Buckley.
It is the old story of the "hill tribe" arrayed against the "water front"
In a new form. Instead of politics and poolrooms this time It Is a religion
difficulty In which politics has already played an Important* factor. The
eW-ment, represented by Town Trustee Crumpton. Constable John
X Creed. K. D. Sparrow and others, assort that the aristocratic contingent
desired an English choir, an English organist and last, but not least, an
English paster. The question of a pastor proved tho bete noire of their dif
ferences. Rev. William Hamilton, the present pastor, was good enough for
tho "plÂ»Â»bs " and they worked hard to retain l:im.
At the annual election held last evening at the church rival tickets for
new directors were placed in the field. The "hill tribe" had an entire new
llHt of proposed directors, and their opponents the same old "solid nine." The
"water front" division "won out" by a fair majority. Mrs Sperry, wife of the
flmir magnate, then set up the claim that the list of eligible voters had been
swelled by the addition of a number of childrenâ that the "p!Â«bs" had stuffed
the great regiptor of the churrh. Pastor Hamilton stated that only three
children had voted and that their votes would be withdrawn. Mrs. Sperry
was still dissatisfied and announced her Intention of asking Bishop Nichols
to take due copnizance of the situation.
As mutter.-; now stand the ol<* board Is declared regularly elected and -will
see to it tl Hamilton \h>- old choir and the present organist are
retained. It Is asserted by nna at the members that the reason for the at
tempt to accomplish a eh ing* of pastors Is due to the fact that the eldest
daughter of John E. Shoobert of the Shoobert-Beale Company is soon to
marry a young English minister, and the desire of the ultra-fashionables
was to see him installed as the head of the church.

FILIPINOS ARE FAR
FROM BEING CONQUERED
American Army Practically Consists
of 111 -Fed Men Waging a
Guerrilla Warfare.
Special Cable to The Call and New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by
James Qordon Bennett.
MANILA, Dec. 6â The hope of ending
the Insurrection and halting military
operations in the Philippines, which
seemed bo bright a few days ago, has
again faded into an uncertain futuro.
Much has been accomplished. During
the last few weeks the campaigning has
been almost phenomenal.
In dreadful weather, through a devas
tated country, across swollen rivers,
along roads that wero impassible for
wagons, artillery, and in some cases for
cavalry, the advance of troops has been
so rapid and In so many directions that
thf\v have often been beyond military
telegraph lines, and operations have ne
cessarily been independently conducted by
the fleid commanders. The army Is right
fully j^roud.
The Insurgents have had a series of
routs and disasters. The slaughter has
been great. They have lost a large quan
tity of supplies and munitions of war and
more than one thousand of their
armed mm have surrendered or been cap
tured during their retreats in the
few weeks. Their government has been
scattered or captured. What of it is at
liberty is in JliÂ«lu. A portion of Aguin
aidos family is in our lines. Agulnaldo
himself is a fugitive.
Notwithstanding all these things there
Is no reason for an extreme optimistic
view of the situation. Notning more is
heard of having the rebellion stamped out
in the course of a few days. That sort
of talk only lasted while the insurgent
leaders were slipping away last week.
Field commanders now think that the end
is still af.ir.
It Is admitted that little is definitely
known or' the present strength or
whereabout! of the insurgents. Akujii
aldo'a entire army ia estimated at mmi
twenty to thirty thousand arrm-.i men.

GAGE'S FAVORITE
PLANS ADOPTED
Successfully Crowded
Out Competition.
â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 6.â has Just de
veloped that the State Capitol Commis
sioners, composed oft Governor Gage,
Treasurer Reeves and Secretary of State
Curry, have' decided upon plans for the
Governor's mansion authorized by the
last Legislature to be built in the rear
of the State Capitol, at a cost of $40,000.
It will be recalled that after the bill be
came a law Governor Gage, without ad
vertising for plans as the law directed.
and without offering a premium for com
petitive designs as provided for in the
act. consulted a linn of architects in his
home town of Los Angeles, and with the
aid of his wife decided upon the kind of
a house he desired to have himself and
which all the future Governors of the
State must live In.
No doubt the Governor, whose will dom
inates the Capitol commission, would
bare had this house built without more
ado but for the opposition of State Con
troller <"oigan. who maintained that he
could not <ir.'iw warrants for the work
unless plans were advertised for as con
templated by law. In this contention he
was sustained by the Attorney General.
The Governor, finding that he could not
proceed contrary to law, after much de
lay called a meeting of the Commission
ers, it was decided to advertise for bids.
Inn as no premiums were offered, none
Ol iln first-la-:- architects of the State
considered it worth while to expend sev
eral hundred dollars in the preparation
of drawings. Among local architects,
n<me of whom bestirred themselves In the
matter, it was common talk that the only
plans to be submitted would be those
first made at the instance of Gage. These
predictions were not far astray, for the
only plans submitted were those first ob
tained by the Governor and those of an
other I^os Angeles firm of architects.
The Capitol Commissioners met and
adopted the original Gage plans, and bids
have been advertised for the construction
of the residence on those lines. Consider
able complaint has been made because of
moving eastward from Bocad. It Is his
intention to drive the rebel general. Pllar.
Into the region north of the lake.
General Wheaton is in Tayug. Most of
his troops in the vicinity are garrisoning
nearby towns.
General Mac Arthur 13 on the railroad at
Bayombonjc.
Colonel Bell Is following westward Into
the mountains the remnants of General
Alejandrlno's troops, estimated at 2SOO
men.
Hurt Is moving with a small command
from O'Donnell westward over the moun
tains to Iba on the coast.
General Grant Is moving from Florida
Blanca southward to B:ilanga. Bataan
Province. Cavito Province will be the
seat of an active campaign when enough
troops arrive to shut oft all avenues of
escape, unless an unexpected surrender
occurs.
All the 65.000 American troops will be
easily absorbed In active campaigning
and garrisoning.
The army cannot continue Its present
exertions another month with the poor
food found In the country without much
illness. It is the general opinion that the
live known Insurgent organizations, of
more than 2000 men each, will at the pres
ent rate be disintegrated Into guerrilla
bands within thirty days.
It la the Impression of the military
authorities that 20,000 men will be suffi
cient to garrison Luzon a few months
heni;e.
Field officers and others Insist, however,
that unless the natives surrender their
arms Luzon must be garrisoned town by
town, while protection must be guaran
teed to the natives now "on the fence"
until a reaction In favor of the Americans
begins.
WASHINGTON. Dec. -General Otis
to-day cabled the War Department that
he has had no word from General Younir
for a week. This is taken to Indicate that
Young is continuing his hot pursuit of
Aguinaldo and probably la In a country
where he regards it as unsafe to use
couriers. General Otis' dispatch, which
follows, also gives an official account of,
Lieutenant Colonel Parker's engagement
at Vigan:
"MANILA, Dec. 6.â General Young, with
thirteen companies of infantry and nine
troops of cavalry, not heard from since
29th ult. He was then about twenty miles
south of Vigan. and most of the troops
were marching to his support, but he then
had with him three troops of cavalry. A
battalion of the Thirty-third Infantry was
sent by boat to Vigan to reinforce the
navy there.
"Lieutenant Colonel Parker of the
Forty-tlfth reports from Vigan on the
6th inst. that he has not heard from
Young for a week. The Insurgents. 800
strong, made an attack on Parker's force
consisting of n Company and 1."*3 sick and
footsore men of the Thirty-third Infantry.
at 4 o'clock on the morning of the 4th.
entering the city in the darkness. Severe
street fighting ensued and continued for
four hourÂ«. when the enemy was driven
out. leaving behind forty dead, thirty-two
prisoners. including many officer- and
eighty-four rifles. They are now on the
outskirts entrenching. Parker says he
can hold out indefinitely, having plenty of
rations and ammunition His loss was
eight enlisted men- killed and three
wounded. One hundred and sixty men are
now being transported from San Fabian
to his relief. Young must be In the vicin
ity with a large force."
the refusal of the Governor to permit a
full and free competition with prizes for
the best plans. Th- State Capitol is a
magnificent structure, built upon classic
principles, and. much as Saeramentans
desire to have the mansion, they would
doubtless prefer to have none at ail than
to have one which would be out of har
mony with the main building, to which
It is to be so close.
It 'nay he that the Los Angeles plans
will drove satisfactory, but It is anrued
that In a matter of the kind the Governor
Should not have been provincial but
should have encouraged the best archi
tects in San Francisco and elsewhere to
submit designs for a structure that Is ex
pected to prove a lastinp ornament to the
beautiful park In which it Is to occupy
next to the Capitol the most prominent
place.
HITCHCOCK MAY BE
HAYWARD'S SUCCESSOR
Governor Poynter Refuses to Discuss
the Matter Until Alter the
Funeral.
OMAHA. Dec. 6.â Ever since the late
Senator Hayward was taken sick and It
wnÂ« known that the chances were against
his recovery there has been considerable
talk as to whom Governor Poynter would
appoint to the vacancy. The only ones
prominently mentioned are ex-Senator
Allen and G. M. Hitchcock, editor of the
Omaha World-Herald. The Democrats
are urging the appointment of the latter
on the ground that they have not re
ceived their proportion of the offices under
the fusion deals of the past few ypar.i
They also urge that the next Legislature
which must permanently fill the vacancy
will have two Senators to select, the Hay
wards successor and one to succeed Sena
tor Thurston. whose term expires one year
from next March. The Populists insist
upon the naming of ex-Senator Allen It
was reported that Allen had stated that
he did not desire the appointment, but a
telegram from him denies this. The
Populist members of Congress from
Nebraska hay*Â» wired Governor Poynter
urging Mr. Allen's appointment and this
has been supplemented by telegrams from
thp Populist and free silver Senators from
other states and some of the Congress
men.
Governor Poynter refuses to publicly
discuss the matter until after the funeral
of Senator Hayward. The funeral of the
late Senator will be held at Nebraska
City to-morrow afternoon.

Whether the pay of Roberts Is stopped

upon by the House officials and will not

case will be permanently settled. Rob

HOUSE FINANCIAL
BILL APPROVED
fijw-lal Dlspitrh to Th.
WASHINGTON*. Dec. 6.â Tlio Repub
lican members of the House of Represent
atives gave their unanimous approval to
day to the House financial bill, recently
Introduced, and recommended Its imme
diate consideration by the House and pas
sage after reasonable debate. Overstrect
of Indiana, who introduced and who is In
Rencral charge of thÂ«? hill, to-morrow will
brail a resolution asking that a special
rule be reported for the immediate con
sideration of this measure. The terms
of this special rule are practically agreed
upon and provide that the debate shall
l^gin next Monday with i final vote at
the close of the week
The harmonious approval given to the
bill came after two hours of discussion,
and the adoption of tWO amendments ap
proved by the framers of the bill. Whtn
the meeting began Cannon of Illinois sur
rendered the chair to Hepburn of lowa,
In order to present his views on Bomo
modifications li. thought desirable. These
related to the national banking features
of the Dill, and Cannon gave it as his
opinion that this branch of the subject
might better bo modified or omitted. He
distinctly stated, however, that he sup
ported the bill as a whole and would vote
for It. and this wai further shown wh<n
he voted for the resolution of approval
Cannon's suggestions did not take the
form of amendments, however, and were
not pressed.
The main amendment was proposed by
the tranters of the bill to , lear up some
ambiguity of the present law. It is to be
a new section numbered â¢Â». and is as fol
lows:
Section 9. That f>cctton 10 of an art approved
July 1. 18fC. entitled -An art to enable national
banking association!! to f-xtt-nd tli-lr <*orporate
existence." be and the came Is amended so as
to read aa follow*:
"Ewtlon 10. TJiat upon a deposit of bonds as
dracrlbed in wotionn r.lHt nnd 51C0 of the rte
vlne.l fitatutÂ»-Â«. the association tnaklnir the same
shall be entitled to receive from the Comptroller
of the Currency circulating notes of different
denominations in blank, roistered and coun
teralÃned aÂ» provided by law, not exceeding
the par value of the United States bonds
tranÂ«!Â»rrÂ«<l and delivered- and at no time shall
the total amount of turn notes Issued to any
cuch association exceed the amount at auch
time paid In of its capital Mock: and the pro
vl.'lons of cectlonfl tlTl and 51TC of the Revised
Statute* are hereby repeaJed."
Another amenament is to section 4 of
the bill. Inserting th.- word "redemption"
before "fund." to make more plain where
rt-deemed notes and certillcates are to be
held.
Warner of Illinois offered an amend
ment relating to that feature known as
the Impounding of the greenbacks, but he
was Kbtisfled from explanations given
that the amendment was not essential
and It was withdrawn. There were some
other suggestions and tentative amend
ments, but none of them were pressed,
and a resolution of approval was then
unanimously adopted. Ovcrstreet and his
associates who framed the bill were
warmly congratulated on having been
able to command such complete unan
imity and approval. which is regarded as
giving assurance that the bin will be
passed before ihe Christmas recess.

The dreadful spectacle occurred on the
peaceful cricket grounds of this, one of
the oldest and among the proudest cities
of Kentucky. The barbarities Inflicted
upon the young negro by citizens of one
of the most highly civilized cities of the
State are mostly beyond belief and can
only be accounted for by the horror creat

frightened and screamed. Coleraan struck
her on the hÂ»ad. knocking her down, but

razor and cut her throat. He picked up
the bleeding body and placed It on the

merce Commission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The Interstate
Commerce Commission to-day gave a
hearing to the representatives of tho sev
eral companies asking for a further exten
sion of time allowed the railroads to
equip their lines with safety appliances.
Two years ago the commission granted an
extension until January 1. 1?JO. The far
ther extension asked for at the present
time Is one year. The representatives of
various labor organizations were also
present to offer their side of the case.
Representatives of about a hundred roads
were In attendance.
John K. Cowen, president of the Balti
more and Ohio, representing M chairman
eighty-eight other roads having SO.'**)
miles of line, made the opening aigument.
He said that Juno 1. UN, CU.2CB freight
cars out of 2,265,000 engaged In interstate
commerce were not equipped with safety
appliances. Slice that time the numter
had been reduced to between 160.000 and
17.-1,000. The argument of tho railroads
axked for an extension, based upon tie
showing made by the roads since the last
application. The showing demonstrated
that the railroads had done as well as
could be expected and could ask no fur
ther extension. Wayne fcfacVeagtl, repre
senting the Pennsylvania and affiliating
lines. Joined in asking for tho extension.
Th- had equipped 140,000 out of 160.000.
President Ki.ajip of, the commission
stated for the benefit of those present
that of the roads petitioning for an exten
sion over M per cent were fully equipped.
He said there was some misapprehension
as to the meaning of the law. which pro
vided that not all the roads should equip
their cars, but that after a certain date
no unequipped cars should participate in
interstate commerce. Fully equipped
roads could not therefore haul unequipped
cars after the expiration of the limit.
At this juncture President Knapp an
nounced ihat the President had sent word
that he would be glad to receive the rep
resentatives of the railroads and labor
organizations present at the White House
at 1 o'clock. The invitation was accepted
and a recess taken.
After the recess Mr. MaeVoagh again
addressed the commission, dwelling upon
the enormous progress already made by
the railroads, which he said had â pent
5100.000.000 to comply with the law. If the
extension were not granted, he .said, the
withdrawal of 175,000 cars from Interstate
commerce would Inflict a serious Injury
upon the business Interests of the World.
Mr. Ely of Die motive department of
the Pennsylvania road gave it as his view
that It would be entirely practicable for
one road to equip all the foreign cars on
its line.
President Knapp at this point stated
that a traveling Inspector of the commis
sion who had been examining the equip
ment of roads for some time had found
an almost ideal state of affairs so far as
handholds and standard height of draw*
bars, but that he had found a surprising
mat* of affairs so far as some of the.al
leged automatic couples Were concerned.
It was discreditable, he said. Tho ap
pliances for operating the couplers, espe
cially the unlocking mechanism, was
found out of order In 25 per cent of the
couplers. Tho couplers could not be work
ed except by going between the, curs and
were more dangerous than the old links
and pins.
Mr. Ramsay of the Wabash protested
against the statement that 2.". per cent of
the couplers were out " of order He
thought 1 or 2 per cent would cover the
couplers out of order. â¢ Th. secretary of
the commission said that four lodges ot
the railroad conductors, eight of locomo
tive engineers and one or firemen had
vengeance at the first opportunity. Still
the ofllcers at Maysville did not act upon
that basis. There was no call upon the
Governor for troops to protect the pris
oner.
Sheriff Perrin yesterday received orders
from Judge Harbeson and. with four as
sistants, went to CovlnÃton, expecting to
return with Coleman yesterday; but after
reaching Covlngton the Jailers at Mays
vllle advised him not to attempt to bring
the prisoner Into Mays vllle last night.
The trial was set for to-day. Sheriff Per
rln determined to leave Covlngton by the
train on the Chesapeake and Ohio, which
started at 7:30 o'clock this morning
from Covlngton. Coleman had been
apprised last night to prepare to re
turn to the scene of his crime. Ho was
Instantly stricken with fear and begged
plteously to be permitted to remain in
Covlngton until after his trial. He said
he expected to die. but he dreaded the
vengeance of a mob.
When he was handcuffed on leaving the
Jail at Covington he was almost paralyzed
and had to be assisted to the patrol
wagon. The crowd about the Jail there
and at the Covington depot added to his
fear. On entering the train he seemed un
able to Bit down until one of the guards
forced him Into a seat. It developed that
in the crowd at Covlncton. and even on
the train, there were some of the relatives
of Mrs. Lashbrook, ready to convey infor
mation of any attempt to secrete the pris
oner. Messages were sent here.
Coleman arrived at Mayuvllle at 10:30
this morning under a special guard swcrn
in by the Sheriff, including Detective Fitz
gerald. Constable Dawson, Chief of Police
Donovan, all the police force and two
Deputy Sheriffs. When they arrived at
the Courthouse they were met by a mob
of 1000 persons, headed by James L.a.*>h
brook. the husband of the murdered wom
an, and all went immediately up Second
street, through the central portion of the
city, to the hill, followed by a crowd which
had grown to 5000 persons. AH was done
that was possible by the Sheriff and guard
to prevent a lynching, but in the face of
such numbers. Irrespective of color, it was
useless to attempt to do anything. The
mob grabbed Coleman, threw a roue over
his head and took him up above the city.
Coleman could be heard above the cries
of the avengers pleading for his life.
The mob carried Coleman to a small hol
low near the railroad, where they bound
him tightly to â  young sapling. The place
of execution had been selected weeks ago
In accordance with all the other arranged
details of the programme mapped out by
the leaders of the mob. The prisoner was
dragged to the sapling and strapped
against the tree, lacing the husband of
the victim. Large quantities of dry brush
and large I its of wood were piled around
him while he was praying for speedy
death. James Lashbrook. the husband or
the murdered woman, applied the first
match to the brushwood. A brother of
the woman struck the second match.
Some one with 8 knife was viclousiy
slashing at the prisoner* chest.
By a sort of cruel occurrence of action
on the part of the mob not a shot <a.is
tired. The purpose seemed to be to give
the wretch the greatest possible amount
and duration of torture. A fatal shot
would have been merciful, but there was
not mercy in the crowd surrounding Cole
man. *

E E. <!.irk. president of the Order of
Railway Conductors, taM he had i>.> de
j-ir.- to embarrass the commission or the
railroads. The employes wanted to be
:. iiile. Th.- defect in the law. he
was that Its enforcement would pun
ish ti well ss the guilty.
In W*. said li.', 19,'S railroad employes
were kiil.-d ami :u.76l had been injured. Of
over tiOo had been kiiN-d and over
led in coupling cars. If the
law had been obeyed and had accom
pllshed the object, not one of those OM n
would have been killed or Injured. \.^
regards the cost, of which the railroads
had complained, he said it was hard to
strike a balance between dollars and cents
and lost lives and Injuries. Railroad or-
Kanizations during the past two weeks
paid out over J1.u00.000 In deaths and sick
i< neflts. As men crippled In the service
were debarred from further employment
r>y railroads, those organizations wanted
as few men crippled an possible. Speak-
Inic of the number of couplers In bad or
der, to which attention has been caJled,
he declared that until the law became act
ually operative it would be impossible to
compel the roads to keep their couplers
In good order. He called attention to the
fact that many roads which were now
completely equipped wore before the com
mlsslon two years contending that it
WOUld be absolutely Impossible for their
roads to equip their cars In less than tlvÂ«
Be said that few private car
lines (owners of refrigerator cars, etc )
showed a disposition to en.upÂ» their cars
He thought sooner or later all roads
would be obliged to equip the foreign cars
on their lines.
While unwilling to take the position
that the law should be made operative
December 31. he said tiie railroad em
ployes ;t.Â«ko<l that th.'lr Interests be con
Bldered. Two years ago the railroads
asked five years. Th< y got two- now they
wanted one. Upon behalf of the employes
be HÂ«k.-d that the time should not be ex
tended more than a few months four to
six months and that the commission
make It plain once for all that If exten
sion is granted It Is the host.
It seems probable a-Â» â  result of the
hearing that the commission will grant
the railroads â  further extension of six
months within which to comply with the
safety appliance set.

ward on the burning pile. Even then,
although it was not certain whether he
was living or dead, the vengeful purpose
of the crowd led them to une rails and
long poles to push his body back into
the flames. It is not certain how long
life lasted. During the process, while
his voice could be heard, he begged tint a
ttrink of water, his tongue protruding and
his eyeballs fuirly starting from his
head.
At the end of three hours the body was
practically cremated. During all that
time members of the family of Mrs.
La.shbrouk ha<l remained to keep up the
fire, and to keen the body In position
where It could continue to burn. After
three hours a nephew of Mrs. I>a<hbrook
was still pushing the body on the burning
embers, while a curious crowd of several
thousand persona lingered on the seem*.
It Is said that on the march through the
city th* prisoner's eyes had been burned
out by add thrown In an eggshell.
In all the thousands who constituted
the mob there was not a .-ingle effort to
disguise <>r conceal identity. No man
wore a mask. All the leaders of the
mob are well known, and there are hun
dred.-, of witnesses who can testify to
their part in the tragedy. They Include
leading dtiaena In all lines of buÂ«dnes.s,
and many are members of the church.
County Judge HarbeÂ»on will Impanel a
special Qrand Jury at once to make a
speedy investigation and return Indict
mt nis against the leaders of the mob.
The Statement from Frankfort that the
Governor proposes to offer a reward for
th* apprehension of members of the
mob does not excite muwh fear that the
reward will be claimed. While there is
a wide difference of opinion among resi
dents of the city who were not connected
w!th the mob. yet there is a strong fuel
ing that no punishment will result from
this- tragedy.
The Coroner held an inquest on the
charred remains of Richard Coleman and
rendered the simple verdict:
"I>eath at the hands of a mob."
The body was left lying In the ashes and
coals, and' at the present writing has not
been removed. Relic hunters took away
the teeth and bones and tle.sh and every
fragment of the body that they could lay
hands on. All afternoon childrenâ some
of them not more than 6 yean oldâ kept
up the fires on the blackened body by
throwing grass, kindling wo. id, brush,
bits of boards and everything combustible
that they could gather.
This they kept up until dark. It is re
lated that <~'nleman. before committing
his crime, threw pepper Into his victim's
eyes from a pepper box. One of the mem
bers usf-,1 that same pepper box tO-day to
throw pepper into Coleman'S eyes as soon
as he was lashed to the stake. To make
sure of B good Job he held open one eye
lid after the other and peppered them
Successively, then drew the eyelids.
In this city the action of the mob Is
generally approvedâ even t nthusiastically
by women, who think that hereafter
they will be safer in conseQuence. Some
men deprecate mob law. but say this case
was an exception to all rules.
The latesl report to-night Is that Pole
man's mother Is on the w.iv here to take,
charge of the ashes of her son.
Late t.i-nlKlit all that was left of the
body of f'olemrin was raked out of the
embers and buried In the potter's field,
Tt was only n skull and two or three
charred bones. All the rest of the body
was ghastly fragments wldelv distributed
among relic connoisseurs. Perfect quiet
reigns in the city to-night.

OLYMPICS
ENTERTAIN
THE LADIES
Indoor Baseball and Swim
ming Races Make Up Ir
teres ing Programme.
The ladles who visited the Olympic
Club last evening looked upon a rare lot
of athletes cavorting In several kinds of
pport. Indoor baseball, swimming races,
water polo and exhibition bicycle riding
made up a programme that did not allow
of a moment's lag in Interest.
The indoor baseball game was the first
event of the evening. It was a contest be
tween the Republicans and the Populists
and the former buried the latter under an
avalancho of popular sentiment, although
the score was close enough to indicate a
hot race for honors. Trie Republicans
Bcored fourteen times to the Populists
eleven and by bo doing won not only the
great applause of the ladies, but promises
of many funny stories from Bob Mltchfll.
But one feature marked the gameâ the
dropping of a pop fly by Populist Glea
son. The teams lined up as follows:
Republicans. Position Populists.
James Pitcher Cartwrlght
Leonard Catcher Fuller
Monohaa First Base J. Follansbee
Tat urn Second Base. Haley
Harrison Third Base Gleason
< ' hb Right Short Wand
Cunningham Left Short ;...Pray
Durham Right Field R. Pray
Taylor Left Field L. Ehrman
After the baseball game the spectators
filed out of the gymnasium and found the
best possible position* obtainable around
the swimming tank. Sid Cavil gave an ex
hibition of fancy and trick swimming and
then a relay race of three teams was run
off. George ' rose's team won out af
ter a most exciting race. The participants
were: Dolphinsâ Melrose, Tape. Connolly.
Cooper ana Boslo: Sharksâ Taylor. Duran.
Cavil. Carroll and Harrison: Plain Fishâ
Hinkel, Burnett, Wilder, Hartman and
Swim :
The final number on the programme
was a water polo match between the
Whites and the Reds or Crabs and Lob
sters. The Crabs crawled all over tna
Lobsters, scoring four goals to one. For
the Crabs Cooper placed one. Taylor two
and Cavil one goal. Pape scored the goal
for tho Lobsters. The mil were:
Whites* Reds.

Indoor baseball promises to be as pep
ular this winter as It was last year. A
league has been formed between tho
Stockton Athletic Club, teams from the
Young Men's Christian Association of this
tity and Oakland, the Reliance and the
Olympic clubs. a handsome silver cup
will be the prize for which they will play.
Died on a Train.
KESWICK. Dec. 6.â Parker Kennedy of
Eugene City, Oregon, died In the tourist
sleeper of the southbound passenger this
morning. Just above this place. He was a
consumptive and was traveling from Eu
gene City to Kalamazoo Michigan. The

OAKLAND'S POULTRY SHOW A SUCCESS
OAKLAND. Dec. 6.â The poultry
and bench show under the aus
pices of the Oakland Poultry As
sociation ar.d the f'ailfornla Col
*Â»e Club, which opened at the Exposi
tion building to-day. Is proving every
thing that has been promised by the
directors, and i' 'idance an 1
manifest Interest during this after
noon and evening is a criterion, tha
show this season will nnt alone be tho
most comprehensive but the largest
attended as well.
It Is quite evident that the breeding
of fancy poult ry has developed so
rapidly during the last few years that
it has now become one of the Impor
tant industries of the State, and the
result is clearly ahown by thÂ© excep
tionally fine exhibits this year. F. W.
Breed, editor of the Western Poultry
Journal and a chicken judge of con
siderable fame, who has attended the
finest poultry shows throughout the
East, declared to-day that as com
pared with the stock exhibited at
Madison square. New York and at
Chicago, the stock at the Oakland
exhibition could easily win. For In
stance, there is one white Plymouth
Rock pullet, exhibited by Â£. G. Hinds,
secretary of the association, that
could go to any of Urn Eastern shown
and get Into the money.

mother being: Jiasni.l Sanchez, but not
withManilinc his Illegitimacy he was
acknowledged by his father as a natural
Fon. and after Mis mother's death La
rcaga took him Into his custody and
lived with him in this .-â¢â â¢â  for some
time. afterward placing: him in the cus
tody of Dr. Wilhelin Uohrmanii, all of ho
time paying for Ills education and sup
port. After Jose Maria de Kaveaya died
Ills will was produced and In It he
acknowledged himself to be the father
of the boy and bequeathed him his entire
estate. The sisters made answer to the
young man's petition in which they de
nied its essential averments.
In his opinion Judge Coffey ,'ns at
the time when tho boy's grandfather,
Don Jose Vicente de Laveaga, came
with his family to Snn Francisco in April
of ]SG7. his household consisting of him
self, his wife, three daughters and his
son Jose Maria, father of the claimant,
and two servants, Hasilla Snnchez and
Jopefa Ivopez; how subsequently Jose
Maria fell in love with th.' servant
Basilla, with the result that the claim
ant was born and acknowledged by JoÂ«e
Maria as his son. Jose Maria, however,
was anxious that his father and mother
should remain In Ignorance of the condi
tion of the servant Basilla; and he ar
ranged to send her to Mexico. She went,
but a short time afterward a letter v - IS
received from Mexico telling of tin* true
condition of the girl. Nacha. Jose Maria's
sister, began to rate him for the decep
tion, whereupon he struck her and I' â '
the house, lie found work dusting pov.s
at St. Francis Church on Vallejo street.
and when his family went to the house
of worship he would wait to see them go
In and thon tell his friend. Torrontequl.
that he was satisfied with the sight of
his parents and could sleep with pleasure
having seen them. I luring all of the time
J<-,Â«./-. Mar:< . .I'it-ii loyal to his child
and the girl who gave him birth.
From all of the proofs the court find*.
that it can fairly and logically be Inferred
from all of the"facts that Jose Maria de
Laveapa acknowledged thÂ« claimant an
his own son and that his prayer for par
tial distribution of the estate to him
should be granted. In conclusion Judge
Coffey grants the prayer of the claimant.
Ansoimo Jose Maria de I^aveaga. rind
the young man by his own right comes
Into possession of on<--fourth of the entire
estate of his deceased uncle, Jose Vln

TEA IMPORTING
TRADE OFTHIS
COAST MENACED
New York Now Hop-
ing to Grab It.
The tra importing trado of the Parino
Is threatened. Bach Is the Interpre
tation of certain recent indications that
prominent tea Importers of Ban Francisco
entertain, it is a large business. Ladt
year tho importation through the port of
San Francisco amounted to â¢.Â«
pounds. A great volume of tnd
poured in through the port of Tacoma
which If the other ton importing point of
the J'acitic Coast when there is .
â¢ nminer. In the first nine months of tho
present year the importations of tea t.,
the port of San Francisco amounted to
; i ounds. These JiKures sufficiently
Illustrate the extent of the tea import
trail.- locally and its vaJue to Importers,
and ills., to transportation companies that
nii.ve the freights ovi-r the Pacific and
th<- continent.
Tin- danger that mr-naces Ban Francisco
In this regard Is the greed Â: x,. w y,, Ik
Thi >i.>r> i>, a long one. it begins with an
order two months .iÂ«.. to ti<- Collector ol
tin Port ot Sin Francisco and also the
Collectors of ;iii other n-.i Importing ports
In the United States with the exception
oi New \>-rk. to >.. ;i<i to the tea examiner
..i the united Stat.s at New York for th.Â»
period of six months from the date of the
order "four-ounc< samplet of :iii im.
teas, whethi r admitted t., entn or
not. lor the purposes of comparison "
i nis order was made known soon to tho
Importers. What action has been taken
by tbe Importers elsewhere is not known
here. I h.- Ban Francisco Importers moved
as soon as possible to miiki- a protest
That protest was made upon the ground
that to sens tin- samples to the examiner
at New York would have the .-nv.-t of
placing that official in the position of
supervising examiner, an otit<-.- not recog
nised in the t<-a law; also that M would
He within his reach to injure the com
merce oi t<a importing ports Other than
New York.
The protest made a prent stir at Wash
ington. Assistai. t Secretary <Â». 1.. Spauld
i\\K <>f the Treasury Department took up
ih<> hint that the power t" control the tea
trade of the country mlgbi !..â  kk.-ii to
the tea examiner at New York i.v the car
rying out of thr- original order. Mr 1
Spauldtng wrote â  letter, in fact, In which '
!.â¢â  s;Md >- lt havtni been shown that it '
whs int the Intention of the Instructions
to clothe tin tea examiner at New Y.iik
with power in supervise the findings of
other tea examiners it is rim deemed ne
ry to reply to that p<>rii..ii (( f ([,,Â»
letter expressing the apprehension that it
would liÂ«- within his reach t<> Injure the
i commerce "f other t<=-a Importing ports
further than to State thai it is th<- belief
nf this department, based upon reports
received as t" the official conduct of such
examiner, that his examination of teas i-<
wholly impartial and uninfluenced l>y geo
graphical considerations."
At the tint tiin-- Information was re
ceived here that the order was issued at
the Instance of the chairman c.f th<'
Hoard of Tea Experts, which sits at New
York, and that the Idea had been enter
tained at Washington that the wishes of
the chairman represented equally w.il the
desires of the other members of the
Board â¢<( Experts.
Til.- duties <<f th^ Hoard of Experts has
been supposed t<> be only the establish
ing of tea standards one- Â»\, vy v ,.,, r f or j
the Kuldanc- Â«.f the trade, and alpo thÂ»-
Bye tea examiners, respectively nt New
York. San Francisco, St. Paid, Chicago
and Tacoma. There was seemingly s sug
gestion that the Hoard oi Kxperts miKht
bo used aa an appeal board, which was
something entirely new. The tea exam
iners. It may he explained, act Independ
ently of one another, being selected by
civil service examinations.
The representation that thn order would
have only the effect of hriiiKint? about
uniform tea examinations did not qaiet
the apprehensions' of the San Francis.-o
tea Importer." in the least. They still see
the danger in this innovation and are
a waiting anxiously advices from Wash

These are the points at which the trust inflicts a

A careful analysis of the local opinion^ as expressed

mills and similar manufactures, demonstrates that

the aggregate the country is prosperdus, with a vast
and rapidly increasing commerce, but the prevalence
of these combinations, which no doubt have wonder
fully economized production, has distributed the
profits to fewer people.
To shV>w the difficulty of dealing with such a ntb
â¢ it is necessary only to refer to the conditions
which the increase in our foreign trade may he
largely attributed. An inspection of the stal
â¢ .* that increase has not been attended by a

have risen all over the world equally, so that
our metal production enjoys no advantage in
respect of prices, our vastly incr- : 'lume
of exports has been at lower prices than were
â¢ tied on a !r-~ volume. This means that we have
the world by underselling the world. In
searching for the reason that has enabled us to do
this there can be no doubt that it is mainly found in
the economy of production due to the trust organi
7ation of scores of our leading industries. So we
have on the one hand gratifying increase in our ex
port trade, and on the other a painful obÂ«oleting of
tabor at home. Reconcilement of the two conditions
requires a long period of readjustment, resembling
that which had to follow the general introduction of
â¢ aiding machinery.
No more difficult question has engaged the atten
tion of modern civilization than this, and Congress
will prove itself the wisest Parliament that ever met
if it adjust it satisfactorily.

A WOR OF ARTILLERY
DESPITE the scantiness of the reports concern
ing the nature of the battles in Sooth Africa
enough has heen disclosed to show that up to
this time it has hern mainly a war of artillery. It a
true that in the first conflicts both sides displayed an
eagerness to come to close quarters, but lately a more
prudent policy has been pursued and the battles have
been at long range. There come after each conflict
reports of terrible slaughter, but when the dead are
ted they are not found to be numerous. Even
it the battle of Moddcr River, where the fighting
r.iKed for ten hours and thousands were engaged on
each side, the number of kiiled was hardly equal to
that of a sharp skirmish in former wars.
The artillery service of the Boers has been some
thing of a surprise to the British. It was expected
the Transvaal forces would be formidable with the
rifle, for they were known to be equipped with
weapons of the finest pattern and to have in their
armies some of the best marksmen in the world, but
it was not known they were so well supplied with
heavy guns and are so capable of making effective
use of them.
It will be remembered that when the attack upon
Ladysmith began General White iras surprised by
the MCge guns which the Boers brought Bgatnstj him.
He made one or two efforts to capture the guns by
rigorotu BOrties, but failed after losing a consider
able portion of his force. In the nick of time for hi:-i
there came to his relief a naval brigade with several
heavy guns from a British warship. With these he
hat naaaged to hold his own and has not found it
necessary to attempt any more of those attacks on
the Boer lines which cost him the Dublin Fusiliers
and the Gloucester Regiment in the early days of the
siege.
It i< =aid by some authorities that the contest is
practically a test of the comparative merits of British
and French guns, as the artillery of the Boers is
mainly of French manufacture. Something is also
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7. 1899.
said to be due to the difference in the quality of the
ammunition used. A British military expert is
quoted as having stated: The difference between the
shell fire of the English and that of the Boers is not
due to the demerits of the melinite used by our an
tagonists or to the virtues of the lyddite used by the
English. Between lyddite and melinite there is no
\cry marked difference. The feature in our artillery
service which has done more to estabH-h the pre
dominance of the British guns is the military time
fuse in the shell. The construction of this fuse is a
secret. It is accurate and can be relied on to explode
the shell in the manner and at the time required. The
fuse of the Boers is a failure, and it is said that not
one shell in a dozen explodes in the manner intended.
It is nicknamed in the army the 'refuse/ '
Whatever may be the comparative merits of the
arms and ammunition of the oppo-ing sides the sig
nificant fact is that war has reached the point where
artiliory has become the dominant arm of the service.
The famous Boer riflemen have thus far cut but a
small figure in the fight. When once the British
have silenced the big guns of the Boers the riflemen
do not remain long to defend the position assailed,
but fall back to another.
By authority of the United States Supreme Court
that facile but lon^abused expression, a "pipe
dream." has been clothed with the respectability of
good English. The combination of pipe manufac
turers has been placed under the ban as a trust.
SOMETHING OF AN INCUBUS.
SENATOR MORGAN has been a stanch silver
â¢man for many years, and was a strenuous up
holder of the Chicago platform, yet he has
found it necessary to remind his constituents that
Democracy is bigger than Bryan, and that even silver
men may have to choose between being Democrats
ami being Bryanites. The Senator's statement is in
line with a sentiment that is growing in the South,
a sentiment that forebodes a strong Southern opposi
tion to the renominatton of the Nebraska man next
WJiile a considerable part of the antagonism of the
South to Bryan i- due to the Democratic imperialists
of tl . still there is much ol it that has a
better foundation. The Richmond Times, for ex
ample, said recently: "We cannot believe just yet
that the solid South as a whole intends to much
â  r permit itself to he chained to free silverisni
and Populism. With all the evidences of prosperity
that surround us how can we longer ding to thu
dead body? 1- it M"t time that we were severing the
bains that bind us to it? Men of the South,
<my ii upon us; it is all around us. We have
only to rc;ich out our hand!; and pluck its fruit; the
game is on and we cannot afford not to be in it
Shall we nger i .Her ourselves to be chained to a
body that would hold us to despair and poverty?
For humanity's sake break the chain and let's reap
the benefit- before us."
In the meantime the silver leaders insist that
Democracy shall accept Bryan and the silver plank
or lose all the votes which they and the Populists
can swing. At the conference in Chicago it was de
cided to arrange, if possible, for a so-called Silver
Republican convention and a Populist convention to
meet at the same time and place with the Democratic
National Convention, so as to more readily effect a
fusion. Such a programme means, of course, an im
mense Bryanite mob to howl around the Democratic
convention and to stampede it if the conservative
delegates should show enough strength to seriously
endanger Bryan's chances of a nomination.
While this preparation for pulling and hauling m
being made by Southern imperialists and Northern
silver men Bryan himself has mapped out a pro
gramrae of activity for the winter which promises to
add much to the gayeties of the season. He has de
termined to stump New England from one end to
<he other and to organize Democratic clubs of the
silver stripe all over that section.
The New Englanders as a rule are not averse to
anything which promises to act as a counter irritant
to the blizzards of their winters, or to warm up the
atmosphere, but still they are not cheerful over the
outlook. They do net like to see a man waste his
time, even if he be one whose time i? worth little,
and the more thrifty among them have been advising
the orator to turn his energies to a more promising
field. They remind him that even if he should con
vert a hundred voters at every speech and make a
speech every night he would not cut down the Rc
s>ulÂ»!iran majorities of that section even if he worked
until far into the spring. It would take 500 nights
at that rate to get ri.i of the Republican majority in
Massachusetts alone, and before that many night-;
have passed thr Presidential election will have come
and gone and been forgotten.
Taking the whole situation into view, about all
that can be said is that Bryan is an incubus and is
likely to remain so. He has just about brains enough
to keep his hold on the neck of Democracy, and
Democracy has not brains enough to throw him off.
His New England campaign will keep him in the eyes
of the public until the time comes to elect delegates
to thr national convention, and for the rest he trust?
to the manipulation of the silver leaders and the
natural capacity of Democrat* for blundering.

Evidence of Alcatraz
Officers.
The rnse against Chaplain David H.
Shields. lh< . , :.iin of Alcatraz
[aland, Iras opened before a court-martial
yesterday morning;. The trial lasted Âil
day and before adjournment Major Urces
beck, Judge advocate, announced that t'i>Â»
prosecution would take up a gooU part
of another day.
One of the lines of defense was suggest
ed In a request from Lieutenant Kiting* 1 ,
counsel for the accused, when be asUed
for permission to send to Fort Wlngate,
where the accused was formerly Btatiotied,
for depositions as to his previous good
character, and also to send to Washing
ton to secure copies of the recommenda
tions upon which the President appointed
him to the service about two years ago.
The court considered the request and
then directed Lieutenant Eltinge to make
out his Interrogatories with the assistance
of the judge advocate and the court would
then consider them further.. The reason
the request was not granted at once Is
that there are several officers on the court
who may be ordered to Munlla at any
time and it may be a matter of olttlcuity
to keep the court together for any length
of time. Besides, the previous good char
acter of the accused may not be a matter
of Issue, and when the Interrogatories are
all made cut It may be that the prosecu
tion will admit all the defense bopet to
prove by m. r : .
The trial opened with the reading of the
charges and specifications against the
chaplain. It was charged that he absent
ed himself from his posi without leave
from November 20 to November 22 and
that he returned from this unduly pro
longed leave in an intoxicated condition.
Captain George P. Bartlett, Third Artil
lery, commander of the post at Alcatraz,
was the linn witness called He testified
that on November 20 lust Chaplain
Shields came over to the island and â¢â¢â¢â 
ported for duty, saying ho bad been as
signed to that post. He dined with tne
captain and then asked permission to re
turn to 'he city for some ol his effects.
He asked, too. If it would make any dif
ference it he did not return on the next
boat and Captain Bartlett said It would
not, expecting, as he explained after**
in his testimony, that If the chaplain
missed the next boat he would come on
the succeeding one. He also testified thai
he had no authority to grant leave tor
more than twenty-four hours to any one
and he expected the chaplain to know
that, although he admitted that there had
been no definite time set for the return
of the chaplain and that perhaps the chap
lain did not know that be had to retain
within the twenty-four hours. All this
was brought out In the cross-examina
tion.
The next time Captain Bartlett saw the
accused was on the Clay-street wharf.
They were both about to go on board the
Sea Queen, which was then doing pail of
the duty of the quartermaster's steamer
McDowell. Bartlett noticed nothing
strange about the chaplain at the time,
and he went on board the boat, but on the
way over he noticed the clergyman on the
upper deck of the tug. There was no
railing on the deck, and he saw the chap
lain walking unsteadily and In apparent
danger of falling over the side.
when thÂ« Sea Queen came up to the
wharf at Alcatraz Captain Bartlett or
dered Lieutenant Spalding to help the
chaplain to his quarters. He also ordered
Dr. Williams, the post surgeon, to attend
Shields. Captain Bartlett believed Shields
was drunk.
Dr. Williams was the next witness
called. He said he went to attend the
chaplain In his room, and round him lying
on the bed. fully dressed and in a condi
tion that strongly suggested that he had
boon drinking heavily. He took off the
man's blouse and his shoes and made him
as comfortable as he could. The next
day the chaplain came to him and he pro
scribed some cough medicine for him. The
chaplain suggested that he be given some
stimulant, and the doctor prescribed some
for him.
Lieutenant Oliver L. Spalding. Third Ar
tillery, on duty at Alcatraz. was the next
witness called. He was th.> officer who
helped the chaplain from the wharf to his
Quarters. Lieutenant Bpaldlng testified
that the chaplain seemed very unsteady
and very weak, and several times as he
helped him up the lon* flight of steps to
the quarters he had to stop and let the.
man rest. The physical and nervous
weakness the chaplain showed Lieutenant
Bpaldlng believed to be very much like
what would follow excessive drinking. On
cross-examination ho admitted that he
knew no more about the effects of exces
sive drinking than any one not an expert,
but he thought the chaplain had been
drinking heavily, and he had seen no rea-
Ron to change nis opinion since then, al
though facts which might account for the
chaplain's weakness had been brought to
his attention.
Continuing, Lieutenant SpaMing s.tid
that wh.-n they reached the chaplain's
room the chaplain threw himself upon
the bed, Jusl :is ho was. and he was soon
In a heavy Lieutenant Spaldinu
also testified that the chaplain scorned

it was also brought out by the prosocu
tlon that when the Bea Q leen rame to

not say that the men had seen th<- chap

charge that the chaplain had been drunk

will probably finish this afternoon
PANHANDLE
EXTENSION
(The Call does not hold Itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but pre
sents them for whatever value they may have
as communications of genera! Interest.)
Editor The Callâ Dear Sir: How can
you recommend the panhandle extension
after having published in your paper of
last Saturday the list of grades at each
cross street; also the fact that at Steiner
street there will be a cut of 100 feet?
Such a rut will ruin property as badly
as the Second street cut did. if you take
a view from the top of your beautiful
building of Second street at the bridge
you will realize what chaos is.
I am in favor of improvements, and
there are many sections of this city which
need it more than does the panhandle
section.
Most strangers reach this city at the
ferry, and they carry away with them the
memory of that dilapidated section with
the "gore lots" jutting, out Into East
street like a used-up saw. And even after
seeing the beauties of our parka City
Hall, etc., they cannot forget the view
which they first had of our city.
Some years ago some one proposed to
straighten the western side of East street
and build a bridge for pedestrians to the
second story of the ferry building.
Market street is our finest business
street, and why not improve that section
around the ferry and then continue the
street from Seventeenth and Castro
streets through to the ocean?. That will
be the finest driveway In the world (and
I have Been many of them), for on the
highest point the bay can be seen from
one side and the Pacific Ocean from the
other. The grades over the hills will not
be greater than over Oak street. This
extension of Market street' would join
Dcwey boulevard- A boulevard can be
opened from this extension of Market
street to connect it with Buena Vista, and
Golden Gate parks. . . . . <*.
The Champs Elysees begins at the Place
de la Concours and the view ends with
the "Arch of Triumph." The view from
the front of the ferry building would pass
between rows of beautiful business build
ings, ending in the Twin Peaks, thus af
fording a i combined view of nature's
buildings as well as of those of man. â¢
There are other Improvements which
could be made. One would be the clear
la* out at Chinatown and laiinir out wide
streets, as was done In Paris.

EXCITING SCENE
AT THE SAILING
OF THE SHERMAN
>
Woman Refuses to
Leave Her Lover.
The transport Olenogle arrived yester
day morning from and the transport Sher*
man sailed for Manila yesterday after
noon. The former brought no passengers
and made the run via Nagasaki In twen
ty-seven days. As soon as she has been
Inspected and the damages assessed aha
will be released and will then go Into the
trade with the Orient, running between
Portland and Hongkong. On November
29 Captain R. D Jones died and the trurn
port came In with her flag at half-ma.".
When the vessel left Nagasaki the cap
tain had a severe cold. It developed In:
pneumonia, and In spite of all the doctor*
could do for him he died. The body was
embalmed and brought to San Francisco.
Captain Jones was 55 years of age and
a native of Liverpool. England.
There was quite a number of the Cath
olic clergy down to see the Sherman
away. Among the passengers were his
Orace Archbishop Cnapelle. his prtvato
i secretary, the Rev. Father Stenmars, iind
his physician, Dr. W. S. Makenson. The
Rev. rather McKlnnon also accompanied
the Archbishop, and fully 600 people were
down to bid the reverend genii- good
by.
There were several changes In the deck
department before the Sherman got
away. At the last moment Chief Offlcer
Roberts received a telegram from New*
York stating that his wife was danger
ously ill. lie at once asked permission ti
go home, and It was granted. Second Ofil-
Mr Walton was th. made chief officer
and the third mate was promoted. Then
th" fourth officer quit, and the vessel wnj
delayed nearly an hour getting a man to
take his place. It was feared that Chief
Engineer Klngsland would be unable to
go nut on the vessel owing to Illness, but
he would not stay at home and the Sher
man's engine-room is still In his chart?'*.
There was one very bitter parting txv.
fore the Sherman left the wharf. Plenty
of colored belles were there and shed
tears when they saw their heroes go up
tho gangplank for the last time, but Mi
mlo simply refused to be parted from her
Joe, and it took a corporal's guard to pet
the young lady's arms from around her
lover's heck. Joe Hums was a hospital
steward at the Presidio and he is bound
for Manila to Join the Hospital Corp*
there. lie wooed and won Mamie Hart
during his Idle moments and promised to
wed her before the Sherman sailed. Jo<*
failed to keep his promise and Mamie hied
herself to the transport wharf. She caught
her faithless lover an he was going up
the gangway and refused to be parted
from him again. Joe mado all kinds of
promises and swore everhtsttng fidelity
on all he held sacred, but hi* sweetheart
refused to bÂ« comforted.
"I won't leave you. Joe. I won't leavo
you." she cried again and again, and what
could poor Joe do but grin and bear It? At
one time it looked as If Joseph would '.'â -â¢>
his boat. as the jjnngway was about to >â â¢â¢
hauled In and Mamie hÂ»-l<l on with a moat
tenacious clutch. Finally the corporuta
guard went to his assistance and JoÂ«
was marched aboard the transport wniln
Mamie walked up the wharf sobbing a*
though her heart would break.
The Harbor Commissioners held quit*
a lengthy session yesterday. The contract
for repairing ferry slip No. 7 was awarded
to P. F. Dundon for JJ47*. the next lowest
bidder being Darby Laydonâ l2*7B. Tho
contract for getting Main street wharf
ready for the Santa Fe was !et to Darny
Laydon for 121 â¢ the next lowest btJJer
being James McMahonâ s23s2.
Ed J. Skully. bartender In the *â  *
saloon on California and Market street*.
met with a painful accident yesterdny.
He was pinning up one of nls sleeves and
while getting the sleeve ready held tÂ»vÂ»
pin In his mouth. While doing so ho at
tempted to speak to a customer and swal
lowed the pin. It stuck crosswise !n hi*
throat and for a few minutes It looked
as if he would choke to death. He was
hurried to the Harbor Hospital, where Dr
Morrison removed the pin after consider
able trouble. Ed Is now suffering from
a badly lacerated throat, but Is able tv "o
about.
Three disabled vessels put back to tort
yesterday. The steamer Laguna. which
left here December 5. broke her chart oft
Fish Rock and came back for repair*.
The schooner Reliance, which left herÂ©
November 17. carried away her cen'er

An Excellent Combination.
Â« The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Strut of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining- the liquid 1 ixa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
(hem in the form most refreshing to the
fast" and acceptable to the system. It
Is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidfleys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna end
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to tl^e California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company

mony was reached yesterday when he
described the killing of Turner. A mo
ment before he had testified that as a
result of the constant worry brought
about by the latter's swindling practices
of which he had been the victim his hair
had turned gray and he had been un
able to get a night's sleep for months.
Then on the eve of the fatal meeting In
the Crocker building he had received a
letter containing still further evidence
of his undoing. He did not know when
he entered the Crocker building, intend
ing to go to C. D. Gregory's office, that
Turner was anywhere in the neighbor
hood.
"I stepped Into the north elevator, the
one nearest Post street," said Frenna,
while the spectators in the courtroom
held their breath in expectancy, "and
went UP to the third floor. As I got out
of the elevator I saw Turner directly in
front of me 1 said:
" "Turner, what did you do with my
land?'
" 'Frenna, you â â , I'll show
yon.' he on ill. _j ~ â 
"As he said that he stepped back and
put his hand behind him. and then I
pulled my gun and kept firing until every
shot was gone "
Frenna said he did not remember any
thing after Turner made the fatal* move
except tiring as fast as he could, until
Mr. Paul spoke to him and took him into
room 27. where he remained until the ar
rival of an officer. He testified that he
had heard from a number of sources
that Turner bad threatened to kill him.
Frenna complained of a plight headache
when he resumed his testimony in the
morning, and this temporary indisposi
tion was very likely accountable for much
of the nervousness he at times displayed
during the 'day. Several times his an
swers to the questions put by Mr. Hosmer
were more explicit and extended than his
attorneys wished to hear, and he was
sharply rebuked for going beyond Instruc
tions. Ho took up his story where it was
dropped the day before, but nothing of
particular interest was extracted from
him until he came to the account of how
Turner had robbed him of a ranch In
Sonoma County by writing in the de
scription of the property In the blank
space on a deed he had previously given
Turner to some Santa Clara property. He
discovered this new evidence or Turner's
perfidy upon sending for an abstract to
the Sonoma property. Intending to ex
change it for an orchard near San Jose.
He received the abstract In C. D. Greg
ory's office in the Crocker building, and
when he saw the statement that his prop
erty had been, according to the official
record, transferred by him to Turner and
by the latter to J. J. Bauer through a
third party, he jumped to his feet and
exclaimed. "Turner- has robbed me
again!" He then proceeded to relate the
events Immediately following his latest
discovery. H- visited George D. Collins,
Turner's attorney, and explained the sit
uation, soliciting his aid in having the.
matter straightened out.
"Mr. Collins told us." said Frenna,
"that Turner was a very lucky man.
that he had escaped going to the peni
tentiary, and' "if he keeps on he will wind
up in San Quentin or somebody will kill
him. 1 "
Then followed an account of his visits
to Rauer'B office and conversations with
Itauer in regard to the deed.
"Did you at any time in the presence
of Mr. Bauer, or in his office in the pres
ence of any of his clerks, threaten to
kill Turner?" asked Attorney Hosmer.
"No. I never did." was the reply. Then,
as an afterthought, the witness con
tinued:
"That would be the last thing I would
do, would be to commit myself in a place
like Raver's office."
This unguarded answer brought Hos
mer to his feet before it was half ut
tered, crying "That will do. that will
do." It was a bad break, but Frenna ap
parently did not look upon It that way.
Then followed the detailed statement of
Frcnna's doings on the morning of the
tragedy until he surrendered himself to
Officer Ross an. handed over to him the
weapon with which he had destroyed his
enemy. This ended the direct examina
tion of the witness, and as it was then
3 p. m. and District Attorney Murphy
was unavoidably absent the case was
continued until this morning at 10
o'clock. It is expected the cross-examina
tion of the accused will be extremely rigid
and will hardly be concluded before night,
so Frenna has a hard day ahead of him.
MORE BOLD SMUGGLING
ON THE CURACAO
INSPECTOR NICHOLSON SHOT AT
A SAILOR.
Five Hundred Cigars Dumped Over
board. When the Watchfulness
of Customs Officers Pre
vented the Attempt.
The coast steamer Curacao added an
other sensational chapter to her smug
gling history yesterday morning at 2
o'clock. The Incidentals were a bag con
taining 550 Mexican cigars, a revolver
shot from the weapon of Customs In
spictor Nicholson and an escaped mem
ber of the CfW.
At the hour mentioned the steamer's
watchman was seen holding a whispered
conversation on deck with an unknown
member of the crew. When the two sep
arated the watchman went down the
gangplank and engaged In conversation
with Mr. Chamberlain, the gangway of
ficer. At the same time the unknown man
stepped off the stem of the steamer. Ho
was Intercepted by Customs Inspector
Nicholson, who commanded him to halt.
The fellow immediately threw a gunny
sack into the bay and broke Into a run.
Mr. Nicholson fired a shot after him. in
flicting a s< rious wound 'on the atmos
phere, and the fellow got away with what
ever other booty he might have had upon
him. The sack containing the cigars was
recovered.
Whon the affair was reported to Acting
Customs Surveyor Chauneey St. John the
guard around the steamer was doubled
and a thorough search of the vessel was
ordered. The Curacao piles regularly be
tween San Francisco and Mexican ports
and brings smuggled cigars to this port
on almost every trip. Quartermaster John
HcnÃoln of the steamer was caught last
Friday by the customs officers while ho
watÂ» trying to leave the vessel with 200
cigars tied around his legs under hia
clothing. Through an oversight the cus
toms officers allowed him to return to the
vessel, and when a deputy United States
Marshal visited the Curacao with a war
rant for Benson's arrest for smuggling
nÂ»-nfon was not to be found. He is still
at large.

It is the consensus of opinion that there
will be trouble In the future between Wil
son, colored, and "Wilson, white. J. N. B.
Wilson, the attorney whose name was
mixed up in the scandal following the ex
posure of the release of Harry Wilson,
the gentleman of color, on straw bonds
alleged to have been forged by ex-Police
Court Clerk Thomas A. Kelly, was on the
stand yesterday In the trial of the ac
cused before Judge Lawlor. Attorney
Wilson's story is bound to create trouble
for some one. He said that on the night
Wilson was released on three charges of
petty larceny he was telephoned to by
some woman whose name, address or ap
pearance he doesn't know. She asked him
to meet bondsmen who would qualify for
the release of the prisoner. He made an
engagement and met none other than C --
grove or some one giving that name and
Edward A. Reilly.
Notwithstanding the fact that Reilly
denied positively on the stand that he had
signed the document or that he had met
Kelly or was aware that his mime was on
the bond, Wilson testified point blank
that Reilly had told an untruth and that
It was none other than he who handed
him the bonds. After meeting the bonds
men Wilson said that all of them went to
a saloon on Mason street, near Post, and
there met Kelly. Kelly refused to accept
the bonds in the saloon, but they went
together to his rooms up on Geary street.
When they were in front of the house
Cosgrove said that he was In a hurry,
and he and Reilly were sworn. Wilson
then took the bonds, secured the prison
er's release and started with him down
town. The prisoner testified during the
case that ho went with Wilson to the Cali
fornia State House on Howard street and
there paid him $300, after which they met
a man of Kelly's appearance. Wilson
then told him to go and the prisoner left
Attorney Wilson swore yesterday that
he never received one cent from hi* client
and that he did not go to Howard street,
but as Wilson (colored) was afraid to go
along Market street, having a fear thai
he would be arrested for a st rangier, they
went up Taylor street and then zigzagged
down to Montgomery. On reaching the
corner of California and Montgomery
streets Wilson (colored) pretended to be
ill. and they took a drink, and later, when
the witness was trying to tind the watch
man to get the key for his office building,
his client took flight and made his escape.
When the witness reached this portion
of his statement Wilson, whose release
caused the present trouble, raised himself
from his seat in the dock, from which he
was viewing the proceedings. For a col
ored man he was pale as death and the
foam trickled from the corners of hfci
mouth. The bailiff asked for permission
to remove him from the dock, but Judgo
I^awlor Instructed the detectives to keep
a close guard on him. He was frenzied
at thÂ« attorney on the stand and his man
ner plainly meant trouble for the witness
when the opportunity presented itself.
The court took an adjournment at this
point, as Assistant District Attorney
Black wanted an opportunity to prepare
for the cross-examination.
During the morning session yesterday
Karl Elsenschlmel, the handwriting ex
pert, testiiled that In his opinion the sig
nature on the bond was In Kelly's hand
writing and was not that of Reilly, who,
Wilson says, presented him with the docu
ments.
A REMARKABLE
CHRISTMAS WINDOW
A Display of Which the Whole City
Is Talking.
A most wonderful piece of work Is now
being shown in three of the large windows
of the Emporium, which easily eclipses
any holiday window display hitherto
ma.de in San Francisco. It Is a reproduc
tion In miniature of every detail of the
front and a hlrdseye view of the interior
of the big store, constructed entirely of
handkerchiefs.
The miniature building is about 50 feet
long and 20 feet high, showing the entire
seven floors. Not a detail has been over
looked. The electric light fixtures are all
reproduced, and when lighted add to the
brilliancy of the scene. On the sidewalk
in front of the handkerchief structure a
constantly moving throng of pedestrians
(dolls of all descriptions) pass and repays
the beautifully decorated windows. These
tiny show windows contain miniature dls-
Clm.vs of dry goods, cloaks and suits,
ooks, furniture, crockery, clothing,
shoes, etc.
Looking into the main entrance, in
which are reproduced the elaborate chan
deliers, bronzed doors, showcases, etc.,
one sees the band stand with its musi
cians; the crowded balcony; the show
cases and counters, and another moving
multitude of dolls representing custom
ers. Two colored doorkeepers are In
charge of the doors of the little store,
just like the well known guardians of the
doors of the big one.
On the windows of the upper floors of
this handkerchief palace the names of the
doctors, lawyers and other occupants of
the offices are printed In gold' upon the
glass windows, Just as they are seen
every day by the thousands who pass the
big granite building. The fronts and sides
of the three windows occupied by the
miniature building are filled with a vast
array of beautiful holiday goods.
The work is the design of Frank L.
Carr, who won the llrst prize and gold
medal In the famous window dressing con
test at the World's Fair In Chicago, and
who Is now employed as head window
dresser In the big store.

VII. THE FOOLS OF SHAKES
PEARE.
BY PROFESSOR J. V. PENNET.
It Is common among readers of Shakes
peare to speak of scenes of Intensity and
Hcenes of relief and to regard the latter :
as less essential than the former to the j
plays in which they are found. The I
speeches of the clowns and tool es
pecially, are often considered as mere
waggery devised by the dramatist as a
temporary relief from the strain of close (
i attention to the main course of the plot. j
j The fool seems to be. is this view, an
extra character, thrust In from time to
I time solely for amusementâ to tickle the ,
ears of the groundlings with his droll
eries. Ills bolt is soon shot, the passing
fun soon over and the play proper re- ,
sumed in earnest. This conception of the
fool and fool scenes, true as far as It
goes, fails of anything like complete Jus
tice to the fool and his Important office.
The fool is co often the wise man of the
play, and the wise men are so often fool
ish, that justice would sometimes seem to
require an even exchange of title roles.
Indeed, that is practically what is pro
posed, ironically of course, in
Lear" (art I. scene 4Â» when the fool
tpaches I^ear the dlffpronrp between "a
bitter fool and a sweet fool."
(The exemplification In part of the fin* that was levied wh*n
Shakespeare purchased the estate of New Place from Underbill ln ISJ7.)
Foolâ That lord that counselled thee
To give away thy lan
Come place him here by me.
Do thou for him stand.
The sweet and bitter fool
Will presently appear; %
The one In motley here.
The other found out there.
I.earâ Dost thou call me fool, boy?
Foolâ thy other titles thou hast Rives away;
that thou was born with.
The wearer of the motley Is not often
the real fool of the play after all. M.-.1
vollo, Olivia's steward. In "Twelfth
Night," so gravel y superior In his treat
ment of the bibulous Sir Toby and Sir
Andrew; co contemptuous of Feste and
tho servants; who has read books, and !s
too lofty In his self-conceit to coun
tenance folly in any formâ how does
Shakespeare leave him In our esteem as
compared with Forte? And, equally de
void with Malvollo of a saving sense of
humor, Polonlus, the sly old politician in
"Hamlet," so wise In his schemes for his
children's advancementâ how does he
fare under the dramatist's hand? What
a fool Hamlet makes of him: Shakes
peare makes Viola say of the fool Feste
("Twelfth Night," act 111, scene 1):
This fellow Is wise enough to play thÂ« fool;
And to do that well erares a kind of wit:
He must observe their mood on whom he Jests.
The quality of persons and the time.
Not. like the haggard. check at every feather
That comes before his eye. This is a practice
As full of labor as a wise man's art:
For folly that he wisely shows Is fit:
But wife men's folly, shown, quite taints their
wit.
And OHa In "As You Like It" (act 1.
scene 2), after Touchstone has declare 1 it
a pity "'that foolH may not speak wisely
what wise men do foolishly, 1 " replies In
the same vein: "By my troth, thou savant
true; for since the little wit that fools
have was silenced, the little foolery that
wise men have makes a great show." The
fool in "Lear" also. when, immediately
after the sharp taunt quoted above. Kent
remarks to the King: "This is not alto
gether fool, my lord." nt once rejoins:
â¢â¢No faith, lords and great men will not
let me: if I had a monopoly out they
would have part on 't; and ladles, too.
they will not let mo have all fool to my
self; they'll be snatching."
In these and similar passages Shakes
peare not only intimates the frequent su
periority of the fool over the world? wise
among the characters, but by unmistak
able eigns possesses us of the uncomfort
able suspicion that perhaps some of the
biggest fools of all are not on the stage,
but fronting it. unconsciously furnishing
the laughter at their own expense.
Lorenzo in the "Merchant of Venice ' (act
111 scene I) says of Launcelot, the
clown:
Oh. dear discretion, how hi* wordÂ» are fulled"
The tOOI hath planted In his memory ;â¢>â¢_,
An army of pood words; and I do know
A many fools, that stand In better place.
Oarnlthed like him. that fur a tricksy word
Defy the matter.
"Lord, what fools these mortals be."
cries Puck, as If to dispel any lingering
doubt that for a complete list of Shakes
peare's fools the great poet would send
us outside of the personao of the drama*,
off the stage, through the audience and
into the world, where each man "in nls
time Plays many parts." "Art Â»nou | wise?"
asks Touchstone of Poor Will In As You
Like It." (Act V. scene 1.) "Ay. sir: i
have a pretty wit," answers Will.
"Why " says Touchstone, "thou sayost
well Ido now remember a saying. 'The
fool doth think he is wise, but the wise
man knows himself to be a fool. ' In
their wise moments fools off the stage
learn what their follies are from the wise
fools and toolish wise men whom the dra
matist puts on the stage for their in
struction and enjoyment. And this Is
doubtless one of the principal reasons tor
the existence in Shakespeare â : so many
varieties of fools and clowns.
They like the children mentioned in the
adage, are privileged to speak the truth,
opportunely and Inopportunely, uncon
sciously and without fear, to astonish us
with It when we are off our guard, to
please us with it as Jacques was pleased
when he found Touchstone "bo deep con
templative." or to startle us with it as
Lear was startled when the fool's words
darted an unwelcome truth home. "I can
tell why a snail has a house." says tne
fool. "Why?" asks Lear. "Why. to put
his head in." answers the fool, bluntly;
"not to give it away to his daughters."
Imogen spoke very wisely and in a double
sense when she said ("Cymbelln*." act 11.
scene 3) that "fools are not mad folkp."
We cannot doubt that Shakespeare looked
with smiling complacency upon the stage
fools of his own creation and with com
plete serenity upon their brethren in flip
world reflected In the plays. On softie of
them he has bestowed almost more than
their ohare of aphoristic wit and philos
ophy. He does not allow us to feel con
tempt for pny of them; he protects them
from our ridicule and often turns the
laugh away from them and upon some
humorless wiseacre, some non-laugh. or
laughter-hater, like Malvolio. We laugh
for the most part with the fool and not
at him; and when we do laugh at him it
is usually because of his own unmlstak
ablo invitation. It is the laughable In
common human nature and In social situ
ation that Shakespeare makes us recog;
nizi*. and the laughter In without hitter

The clowns will

the superstition of
Shak are's age.
Of course it would
bo easy to overrato
the Importance of
the fools and clown ;
in tho plays and
foolish to expect tn>
find meaning in nil
of their nonsena**.
A dramatic reason
is not to be aoucht
every time th<y
come on the stage.
The repartee of tho
clowns, especially la
the early comedies.
Is superficial and
.me â¢My verbal,
crowded with puns
and forced conceits.
The fun flies fast
und furious; tho
:ombat of wits Is
proton tf Â« d until
sometimes It be-
c o mes wearisome:
the quality of the humor do- not
seem to matter so much as the ability
to keep the war merrily going. Tho
clowns are sometimes put, as it were, on
their professional honor to maintain a,
rapid cross-fire of nonsense and folly.
even though the JokeÂ« be not wort. very
much as Jokes.
Hut making due allowance for all of
this, there ls.the other danger, to which
modern readers of Shakespeare are pecu
liarly liable, of regarding all of the clown
utterances as of little Importance and of
underrating their part in the advance
ment of the main business of the plays.
It is significant that Shakespeare civ. Â»
most of them some dramatic work to do,
and sometimes it Is Important work.
Costard, the clown In "Love's Labor*
Lost." Is a silly country booby: he Is al
most "a natural"; he belongs to the low
est order of Shakespeare's fool-folk; ho
is unconscious of the droll figure he cuts
and Incapable of Intentional wit; llttlo
Importance can be attached to any of his
sayings, yet Costard's part In the de
velopment of the theme could not easily
be dispensed with. His prompt violation
of the king's decree makes that solemn
Instrument laughable af once. Costard
succumbs to a higher or lower but at any
rate a more natural law than the king's,
as his betters also do. In the end. Includ
ing the king himself. Shakespeare keeps
this poor clown In close, though uncon
scious, complicity with the main plot at
every point. The Costard element In tho
play affords a humorous comment on th.)
king's folly and affectation In disregard-
Ing natural human Instincts.
Launco and Speed, the clowns In tho
* Two Gentlemen of Verona." and Lnun
celot of the "Merchant of Venice" 'eloni?
to the snmo low order as Costard. ThÂ« /
are unwitting or natural fools. Launce I*,
however, capable of a vulgar kind of cun
ning. He manages to get Speed a whip
ping as a penalty for reading his letter
and prying Into his love affair. The stago
work laid out for Launce seems unimport
ant until It Is noted that he Is employed
at lÂ»-MFt three times to hold up In * cleur
light the Innate vulgarity of hi* master,
Proteus. When Launce enters with hi.*
dog (act 11. scenr 3) Proteus, not y*>t
known to the audience in his true char
acter of flirt, has Just parted from Julia
and left her In tears, though Proteus him
self, In spite of his tine sentiments, has
not shed a drop. Proteus Is soon to provo
untrue to Julia. In preparation for this,
Launce vulgarize*, the scene by df-scriblnj*
his own parting from his family, all nt
whom have "this very fault" of tears, ex
cept the satirical Crab. "I think Crab,
my dog. be the sourest-natured dog that
lives; my mother weeping, my f.ith-r
walling, my sister crying, our maid howl-
Ing, our cat wringing her hand* and nil
our house In great perplexity, yet did not
this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear; ho
Is a stone, a very pebble-stone, and has
no more pity in him th i a dog." Wo
remember this last against Proteus when
be forgets Julia. Launce's Instinctive ob
scenity (act IV) In re-counting Crab's mis
demeanors also reflects upon Proteus,
whotu* moral offenses against love am
parodied by Crab's conduct. I-iunro 1
lovft affair (act 111, scene 1) is about as
serious and sincere In reality as the lovÂ©
affairs of Proteus. Launcelot. In the
"Merchant or Venice," performs a dra
matic function similar to that of Launr*.
Shakespeare has made him serviceable
to the theme of the play. Launcelot run*
away (before Jessica does) from the rich
Shylock to enter the service of the poor
but generous Hassanlo. because Bassnnla
has "the grace of God, sir." while Shy
lock only "has enough." UN reflection*
on the right and wrong of running away
(act 11, seenÂ© 2Â», leading him through ii
struggle between conscience and the n>nd.
and resulting In his decision to follow th 4
advice of the fiend as being more nearly
right, furnish a comment on Jessica's
flight the right and wrong of which I*
equally hard to determine. The see Â«
with his father, which brings out thÂ«Â«ir
fondness for each other, reminds us by
contrast of the fueling existing between
Jessica and her father.
Noteâ This study by Professor Denary
of Ohio Btato University will be concluded
on Monday next.

Boston Wool Market.
â¢ TON. Dec. Â«.â TTio American Wool and
Cctton Reporter will say to-morrow: There
I htui been a very considerable lull In business
during the rant week, the volume of transac
tion* being less than one-half of that reported
during the preceding week. This quiet condi
tion of affairs Is not unwelcome to the trade,
as It rives them a chance to catch up on de
liveries. The strength of the, situation Is In
no wise weakened, owing to the continued
firmness and hardening tendency of values
abroad, which enable wool to be exported at a
rrpflt In case it Is not wanted here. The mar
ket Is In a very irregular condition and quo
tations on several grades are largely nominal.
Holders' idens as to the 'values of wool vary
and some lots are held far above the market.
The sales of the week In Boston amounted to
6.4. -.200 pounds domestic and 24P.000 pounds
foreign, making a total cf fiJ21,230 pounds.
against a total of 13 913 000 for the previous
week ard a total of 3.C3T.000 for the correspond
ing week last year.
Sales since January- 1 IS* 0 , amount to 334.
503.77G pounds, against 125 4W.610 laet year at
this time.
London Wool Sales.

'WHEATâ Liverpool and Paris futures were
higher. Cargoes on passage for Liverpool were
firm, with a good Inquiry, but oft coast cargoes
were easy and neglected.
Chicago opened firmer on hotter foreign ad
vices, and there was a good shipping and spec
ulative demand. Continental bids were 3c
higher, and there was a good Continental de
mand for Whent, Corn and Rye. Receipts were
light, those at primary points being 755,0Â«J0
bushels, only half .if last year. The interior
movement was light. Later on In the session
news from the Argentine checked trading and
the markft fell back.
Th- 1 local market followed Chicago up and
down. Spot price* were firm. The demand for
shipment was fair and Improving.

Continued on Page 11.THEY MAY YET
APPOINT MORE
SCHOOL MARMS
â Â«âÂ« â
Directors Still Plot a
Clean-Up.
ORIGINAL PLAN TO BE WORKED
BERGEROT SAID TO HAVE MADE
A BAD MISTAKE.
School Director Kemp and those other
sncmlxrs of the Hoard of Education who.
at the last meeting, "stood in" with him
â¢â¢Â» rescind certain rules In order to make
room for more t< achcrs in the department,
have r.ot given up hope for the success of
liiiir plan, notwithstanding that they
were thrown down by President Bergerot.
They claim that Bergcrot overlooked one
Important point In parliamentary law
whi n, in his eagerness to make capital
with Major Phelan and a grandstand play
to the gallery, he ruled Kemp's resolution
out of order. Instead of being out of or
der Kemp's resolution was regular and he
and his cohorts intend to insist upon its
<*onÂ£idcraiio:i at the next regular nieet-
Jng. Despite the fact that they have lost
Jtirgt rot's vote they claim to huve enough
io curry their game through, with the
votes of two members of the so-called
dub Five, whott names they refuse to
divulge.
Although they are confident that they
wjll work their game through Kemp and
his crowd are well-nigh desperate. They
have several times i>laumd tor an end-ot
the-year clean-up, but each time their
.-oh*mes have been balked and they now
have but a month to put things through.
In addition to Kemp's original plan they
have another which is said to have been
pointed out to them by Superintendent
Webster. Ah was stated in The Call a
r hort time ugo Webster Intends to appoint
W. D. Klngsbury. Clarence Walker and
â¢ 'harles G. Murphy as his deputies under
the charter. All of these men are en
}>loycd In the School Department at the
present time- and will be itgularly ap
pointed by Webster at tho tirst of the
year, leaving their positions to be filled by
the Incoming Hoard of Education. Kemp
and his crowd are now li^urlng on an
ticipating Sui>erintendent Webster's ac
tion by withdrawing the thr<e depulles-to
be from the department and putting them
Â«>n the unasslgned list to wait Webster's
action. In th:s way they would bo able
to appoint their successors in the depart
ment and .....;â¢_â¢ the credit of having
placed three fat salaries.
Another possibility Kemp and the crowd
are figuring on is that J. B. Clark, now a
frachtr of math*matlcs in the Polytechnic
litph School, will be appcinted on the
Â«'l\il Sen ice Commission. Clark has a
Strong petition before the Mayor, and If
he gets the job tho push will at once put
him on tho unassign<-d list with Kings
bury and the rest and hand his Job in the
department out to tome one or other of
their deserving favorites.
Klngsbury's appointment to a deputy
*hip Is being questioned by many mem
|rf-rÂ«* of the department and oy those post
al In school affairs. The charter provides
that Superintendent Webster's appointees
shall have had at least five years of suc
<<Â»-s-ful service In the School Department.
t->ut it Is known that charges of inccm
petency have hern twice preferred against
Ktngsborjr within the last five yearsâ
once by Albert Lyser, principal of the
.l"hn Swctt Grammar School, and a eee
â¢ 'T.d time by Mrs. Manning of the Everett.
His eligibility to ofilce is questioned bo
cause of this fact, and it Is possible that
because of it "the push" may lose one of
the fat places they confidently expect to
pull out before the end of the year. Unless
publicity Fends the pang to cover they will
cork their complicated scheme through
:it the next meeting of the board.

MYSTERIOUS PERKIER DEAD.
The Police Think That His Injuries
Resulted From a Fall.
The death of John Terrier at the City
and County Hospital last night without
Ills having regained consciousness leaves
the mystery of tho man's Identity and
also the real cause of his death In the
same condition as It was when ho entered
St. Mary's Hospital. Terrier la the man
who was .with a fracture of the
skull on November 23. when hff was ad
mitted to St. Mary's Hospital for treat
ment and afterward removed t.i the City
ami County Hospital, where ho .lie.) At
thÂ«j timo of his admission to St. .Miry a
Hospital he plated that ho was a sheep
herder and that he had been pet upon by
highwaymen and robbed. This statement
he afterward contradicted somewhat and
said that he was from Fresno, where he
had a wife residing.
Inquiry at thÂ«* latter place failed to ver
ify this statement, and the Police Depart
ment was put on the case, with the par
tial result that Detectives Crockett and
Cody came to the conclusion that the In
juries to his head were produced by a fall
while the man was under the Influence of
liquor. A diagnosis of his Injuries by the
physicians at the County Hospital bore
out this conclusion. Now that the man is
dead nothing further can be ascertained
In this direction, and It is doubtful
whether any further light will be ':. .1 on
the man's identity or the real cause of his
injuries.

MADE HEX BOW
TO SOCIETY
Music, calcium lights, rare blossoms and
a wealth of palms and cool green ferns
were among the many delightful aeces
' sorles that made the debut ball of Miss
! Azalea Keyes at Native Sons' Hall last
1 evening an event that will be handed
j down in the social history of the State.
Native Sons' Hall has been the scene of
many a noted social gathering, but
never before did it put on po artistic a
dress to do honor to a festive occasion.
. Dainty coloring.*, pale pink, tender green
, and snowy white wore blended harmo
niously in the decorations of the hall. Tho
plain, bare walls, were hidden behind a
rcreening of delicate green bunting, stud
ded with silver stars. The stage, banked
with palms and ferns, resembled a tntnia
. ture forest, while in the balconies thÂ«;
i tropical effect was enhanced by many
growing orange trees, laden with the
: golden fruit. From the center of the ceil
i ing pink and white streamers radiated to
; the oalcony rails and at irregular Inter
' vals umbrellas fashioned of holiday greens
i and lanterns tilled with ferns were hung.
! The whole scene was heightened by the
; electrical effects and the multi-colored
i calcium lights which shed their brilliant
i rays upon the merry dancing throng.
At 'J o'clock the guests, 4VU in number,
i began to arrive. The fair young debut-
I ante greeted them, in which pleasant duty
duty she was assisted by Mrs Alexander)
D. K. yen, formerly Miss Kate Salisbury.
At midnight an elaborate supper was <
; Fcrved, alter which dancing v..is again
resumed and continued till early morning.
The debutante in whose honor the elab- .
orate affair was given is the only daugh
ter of Wlnfleld Scott Keyes. She is tall.
svelte and a beauty â one that will attract
quite as much by her intellect and wit as
by the regularity of her features and her
aristocratic bearing. Miss Keyes wore a
very hand.Â«om<* guwn of w;hite satin,
shrouded in white tulle and trimmed with ;
npple blossoms. Mrs. Keyes. who ap- '
pea red for the first time in her role of
matron and chaperone. wore her wedding ;
gown of heavy white satin, trimmea with ',
Old lace and trailing grasses. Diamonds j
glistened in the corsage of her gown and
In her dark hair.
Last evening's entertainment is but the
first of a number of elegant affairs Mr. !

RACINE, Wls.. Dor. Câ Rev. David B.
Cheney of the First Baptist Church and
his wife were shot by a burglar at Vi
o'clock to-day at their home on Lake ave
nue. Mrs. Cheney was shot in the breast.
The ball g'.ar.ced downward and is be

In the cer.tcr of the breast. Both are in a
critical condition.

Rev. David B. Cheney is one of the best
known Baptist preachers in the State. He
has occupied jiulpits at La Cros6o and
Superior ar.u for several years was preti

IS NOW A FOOTBALL
MISSIONARY IN CHINA
OAKLAND, lÂ»ec. â Roscoe A Goodceli. a State University graduate
of the class of '59. who went to Shanghai, China as an educational
missionary, has, aside from his success as teacher In an English
school there, acquired the novel rule of football missionary as well.
In a letter Just received hero from Mr. Goodcell he tells of his expe
rience In introducing "the pigskin game among the plg-talled Celestials."
Goodcell, In company with the well-known Lyman of Stanford '96, visited the
Nan I m University and was cordially welcomed by Professor Ferguson.
"While there, Mr. Goodcell writes, he initiated some of the Chinese students
Into playing American primes.
"Lyman and 1 lined them up. 11 writes Goodcell. "and fairly started what
promised to be a good game of football for novices, when suddenly some
liny spectators pitched Into the game. Tho Chinese would kick as lively as
possible, but they would never pass the ball. They throw a ball Just like a
girl, and after an hour's practice they managed to catch about one out of
five throws, the rest landing on their stomachs."
Mr. QoodceU says, however, that the Chinese "went perfectly wild over
the beanbag game."
Incidentally the young missionary writes that, owing to the large num
ber of British subjects residing In China. England appears to hare Chinese
sympathy in the Transvaal war. lie declares, too, that the opinion pre
vails there that the scheme of China's division will be accomplished, but that
Shanghai will bo simply a spectator to this division and will not bo dis
turbed. Mr. Ooodoall was lately elected chaplain of the Masonic lodge at
Shanghai. He is a son of Hoscoe Goodcell, the well-known local attorney.

NO DISSENSION IN
THE TOWN AND GOWN
Berkeley's Exclusive Club Loyal to
the Wife of the University's
President.
BERKELEY. Dec. 6.â A canard circu
lated here to-day regarding Berkeley's
exclusive and prosperous Town and Gown
Club has created more amusement than
Indignation. The club some time ago con
sidered means of suitably honoring Itself
and the new official head or Berkeley so
ciety, Mrs. Benjamin Ide Wheeler, by of
fering her some special status in Its mem
bership. It was concluded, however, that
as an honorary member Mrs. Wheeler
would not have that Intimate relation to
the organization that Its members hoped
she would feel willing to sustain, and
hence she was voted In as an active mem
ber by special election and at once wrote
a gracious letter of acceptance.
It is thus absurd ns well us untrue that
Mrs. Wheeler could have been "black
balled" at the recent election of members.
Moreover, the story that only ladies re
hiding above Dana street were chosen is
false, and aa to the number rejected only
the members of the secret admission com
mittee know who were considered besides
the nucceusful applicants.
Mrae. I'aget. founder of the club, said
to-night: "It is shameful that such an
attack should gain circulation as that
printed by an afternoon paper. It Is false
from beginning to end. I am only grieved
for Mrs. Wheeler, but it will not trouble
her. She is above it. As for the Town
and Gown. Club, it is and has from thÂ«
first been united and never more co than
now. The story Is absurd."

OAKLAND POST
OFFICE SITE IS
FINALLY CHOSEN
The Stevens Property
Is Selected.
Oakland Offlre San FYar.risro ("all,
908 Uroadwav, !>.â¢â¢ â¢
The ulte for the new Oakland postottlce
has been selected by the Treasury Depart
ment and the erection of the building will
bejrln at once. TcleÃrams were received
In Oakland to-day from Congressman Vic
tor H. Metcalf and Senator Georcc -â¢
Perkins rtatlng that the Stevens property
on the southeast corner of Broadway a:nl
Seventeenth street had been selected aui>-
Ject only to the delivery of a perfect title.
This property la ISO feet on Ilroadwp.y
by 150 feet on Seventeenth street nnd is
at present vacant. It belongs to the Ste
vens estate, the heirs being Mrs. A. D.
Wilson and MrÂ«. 11. D. LÂ«throp, the
widow Of the Rev. H. D. Lathrop. The
property was originally offered at J72.UW,
but wh"n thÂ«. Treasury Department an
nounced that no property offered at nvre
it. in $sf),vW be considered tbu ppcn *c
upon this piece was reduced o the re
quired figure and the offer was accepted.
There Is a little side light on this nal*
that Is of Eomo interest, because of the
contest between two rival streets. It w.is
partly a contest between Broadway and
Washington street and Broadway wyn
out. The property owners and merchants
of Broadway wanted the site selected
somewhere on the east side of Broadway
In order that It might act as a check to
the. movement of the commercial center
to Washington street. This movement his
been quite decided in the last twelve
months and the Broadway property own
erg were very anxious that the new Gov
ernment building should go where It would
help them and not their rivals. On the
other hand the Washington street own
ers were anxious that it should go west
of Washington street or out San Pablo
avenue. The Broadway advocates have
won their light and this will stay any fur
ther movement westward.
This settlement of the question Is of
great benefit to Oakland. They have had
a 1250.000 postofflce appropriation for â 
considerable time, but they were umble
to have a site selected and the contest
became nearly as bitter as that for ;ne
library site. Congressman Metcalf *n
nounced that his principal object In Wash
ington this winter would be to secure the
Immediate erection of the postofllce build
ing and it is very evident that hia efturts
have had an immediate effect, l'lana have
already been completed in Washington for
the building and the people expect to see
the Structure under way before next year
Is very old.
WANTS NO TRIAL
BY ALAMEDA JURY
Oakland Office San Frankly
908 Broadway, Dec. C.
C C. Sullivan, the accused burglar,
who was captured on the night of Oc
tober 8 last, when his pal. Wilbert Will
more, was shot by the Alamrda police,
has filed a sensational affidavit on which
his attorney. T. J. Crowley. will base a
motion for a change of venue when the
trial comes up before Judge Hal] next
Friday.
Sullivan claims that It will he impossi
ble for him to have a fair and Impartial
trial by reason of the bias and prejudice
Of tl'.e citizens of Al.ini- <U County
againet him, and asks that he be tried In
another county. His affidavit
minutely relates "the hue and cry set up
by the multitude In AlamÂ»d.i" on the
night of the burglary at O. Gott'p |i
store; how on that occasion a large num
ber of citizens with pistols, shntgu: :
other weapons t..nk pan In v. ..
cultlng In the killing ..f young \\
and th< <apturÂ« of the deponent. ll*
cites that thÂ» axcftcmani
the. multltuda reached tosuchli I
on that numorshln occasion that there
were dwuoustraUona of personal \ ;
against him; tl.at som.- < ri^d out "Lynch
him: Kill him! Sh..,t him: S^nd "him
along with his partners!"; that deponent
verily believes that hut for the Interven
tion of the police aerloua bodily Injury if
ni>t d^ath would hay.> rÂ« "de
fendant at thit time. Sullivan also com
plains bitterly of tliÂ«> notorlely given the
i-;tse by the newspapers-
Sullivan pcrtlcularly objects that the
play of Tlic Burajiar' Is to be presented
on the same day tlxod by trie Superior
Court for his trla.lâ next Friday.
I'istrlct Attorney Allen, when ques
tioned, would not state whether an In
junction will be Issued to prevent the
AUm-'da performance. In any event, the
motion for change of venue will probably
be disposed of by Judge Hall Friday
morning, and It Is not unlikely that Judge
Hall may place his disapproval in an In
junction upon the play of "The Burglar."
The Bride Paid the lee.
OAKLAND, Dec. 6.â The fact that the
law allows a Justice of the Peace 13 for
performing the marriage ceremony was
most forcibly Impressed upon Ole Edward
Nelson, a Norwegian, aged 32 years, who
suddenly summoned Justice Quinn this
afternoon to oÃlclate at the matrimonial
event of his life. The bride was Miss
Lena Mnquln. and tho thirty summers
she has passed beneath the California
sun came well in hand. At the conclusion
nf the ceremony performed In County
Clerk Jordan's private office the groom
(shelled out two shining sliver dollars in
payment of the Justice's fee. He was
courteously advised that the law has fixed
the fee at $3. The abashed groom, after
fumbling for the extra dollar, inquired
of the bride for t c balance. She pro
fessed poverty: nor did the witnesses

p<fem to he equal to the emergtney. Sud
denly th* bride struck an idea and rush
ing behind a screen quickly emerged,
flashing a shining $5 gold piece, and M
â¢he Justice, amidst profusion of blushes,
got hi fee.

when captured by the officers a number
of the missing articles were found In hlÂ»
possession. Some telephone slugs were

FARO GAMBLING CASES.
Judge Conlan Denies a Motion for
IHsmissal on the Ground of De
fective Complaints.
The motion of the attorneys In the ca*es
of Asa Hamilton and others, charged with
visiting Joe Harvey's resort at 143 Mason
street for the purpose of playing faro, on
the ground that the complaints were de
fective was dismissed by Judge Conlan
yesterday and they were continued till
Saturday, to be set. The Judge said he
had his own opinion as a lawyer on the
question, but he declined to accept the re
sponsibility of declaring the ordinance In
valid. He would leave that to the Supe
rior Court.
Attorney Heggerty remarked that if the
complaints were defective there could be
no conviction, and he thought it was
within the Judge's power to dismiss the
cases.
The Judge admitted there was no sucb
officer as "Acting Police Judge," and sec
tion 33 of ordinance 1587. under which thf
complaints were drawn, was defective in
asmuch as it prohibited a person from
visiting a house for the "practice" of
gambling instead of for the "purpose" of
gambling, but he would prefer that thÂ«
Superior Court dealt with the question
He was glad to see that the Hoard of Su
pervisors proposed taking steps to revise
all the ordinances, as a great many of
them had been picked to pieces by deci
sions of the higher courts.
HOW BULLION ROLLS IN.
The Year Is Breaking the Record at
the San Francisco Mint.
The San Francisco Mint received $7,500.
000 worth of gold in November, and aa
there were no Australian shipments of
Hr;tlÂ«Â»h coin the whole amount Is new
gold fresh from the veins and gravels of
the Pacific region from Alaska to Mexico.
Superintendent I^each says that 1899 will
break th>- record of the receipts of bullion,
though the total receipts may not be aa
lnrpt- as in Rome years when receipts of
foreign coin were, heavier. It shows, how
evt r, the rapid increase in gold produc
tion.
Of course the Klondike Is largely
thanked for tbÂ« year's receipts. Mr. Leach
estimates the year's output coming from
Dawson at $16,000.00) or a little over. A
little of this romi'S from the American
Â»lde In that region, having been sold in
Dawson. Nearly all of the Klondike gold
reachea the San Francisco Mint. The
Cape Nome gold which has come down
this season h.us about all reached the
Mint. too. Its fineness Is found to be
higher than the Klondike gold, averaging
about 117 to about $15 or $1j 60 for the gold
from the Klondike.
GRAND ARMY WILL
NEXT MEET IN CHICAGO
McKinley and the Democratic Presi-
dential Nominee Will Be Invited
to Attend the Sessions.
CHICAGO. Dec. The National Coun
cil of the Grand Army of the Republic,
meeting hero to-day with the local gen
eral committee, agreed on August 2S to
September 1 us the date of the next an
nual encampment, which will be held In
Chicago.
In the general discussion of the council
It was agreed that the encampment
should be held at some time during the
public school vacation so that the public
schools might be used as sleeping quar
ters for members. It was said by mem
bers of the committee that there were
many veterans who might wish to attend
the encampment who could not stand the
financial burden of paying hills at crowd
ed hotels. At other encampments tents
have been used, but the committee deems
it more advisable to use the school build
ings.
The members of the committee called on
Mayor Harrison at the close of the morn-
Ing session. Mayor Harrison urged that
the encampment be made non-partisan in
every detail, and suggested that Inasmuch
as President McKlnley would be present
the Democratic Presidential nominee be
also Invited. Thl? "will be done.
"The President is â  member of the
Grand Army of the Republic and always
attends the encampments in his capacity
as .i member," said Commander In Chief
Shaw after the conference. "There Is
nothing political In the invitation we
have extended him. The Mayor's request,
however, Is a Just one and will be com
piled with."
The meeting closed to-night with a din
ner and reception to the visitors given by
the Department of Illinois, Grand Army
of the Republic.

GAGE SUGGESTS
MODIFICATIONS
Present Banking Laws
Too Strict.
. q P*clal Dispatch to ThÂ« Oall.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 6.â The annual
report of Lyman J. Gage. Secretary of
the Treasury, was tiled here to-day. After
dealing with the financial condition of the
country, expenses of government, etc..
Mr. Gage makes the following recom
mendations:
1. As to conditions of capitalisation. Th*
law requires a minimum capital of $60,000 as a
precedent to organization under the national
bank act. While thU would seÂ«m to be a fair
and moderate limit. It is undoubtedly too large
for the resources, of small communities, where
banking facilities are much needed, and It Is
suggested that for places of a population of 1000
or leas the minimum be reduced to 125.000.
.-â¢ Th Â« national bank act clearly recognizes
the note-issuing function as a proper one, but
It Is plain that the original conditions and lim
itations Imposed have, under changing condi
tions, become substantially prohibitive In their
terms. This ought to be n?studled. and as
lame a liberty given as may be consistent with
" , !&.'" th * *ercl*e of that useful function,
.i . ? law Prescribes percentages which na
tional banks shall carry In cash against their '
deposits and limits the amount of risk which '
,a f n - " haU uke ln loans to Â» n > " " lndl ' I
vtdual. firm, or corporation. The percentage of
cash reserves seem to have Justified In practice
the provision of the law. but the limitations on
loans have been found" to work with great in
equality. The recommendations of the Comp
troller of the Currency on thin point, to be found
in his report to Congress last year, merit care
ful consideration.
4. While limitations and restrictions exist In
several directions, no limitation has ever been
given as to the ultimate liability a bank may
carry upon a given amount of capital. Upon
this point the bank with $20,000 capital Hands
legally as free as does the bank with $5,000,000 |
capital. Cash reserves are a defensible subject
of legislation, because they affect the Imme- ,
diate solvency of the bank. The limitation of
liability compared with capital Is equally so.
since the percentage of capital and accumulated
surplus affects the ability of the bank to bear
Its own losses. Capital, loans and deposits
bear . healthful and proper relations to each
other. Everything elsÂ« being equal, the meas
ure of risk Is determined by the extent of the
loans; and for the ultimate solvency of the j
bank as to Its deposits, the capital of the bank ,
I' the proper guaranty. The capital should, I
therefore, be relative and fairly adequate to the ;
rinks Involved.
It Is mainly In the lack of 'adequacy to public !
needs that our national system Is at fault. I
The repressive effect upon note issue* destroys, ]
or Injuriously limits, one of Its very Important â 
functions. How ln certain particulars this In-
Jury results I have tried truthfully to show.
In view of the weakness and limitations which
time and experience have brought under notice.
efforts have been made to modify the national
banking act. In the House of Representatives .
of the last Congress, certain bills were pro- |
posed embodying measures which I believe I
would be effective toward needed reform. I
These measures" In their general principles are I
approved by the Informed Judgment of th â â¢ most
thoughtful of our people. It is to be. expected ,
that they will be again offered for the consid- :
eration of the present Congress. Without In- '
dulging In specific recommendations at this ,
time, which If made could be but repetitions
of previous recommendations. I commend the
subject to the thoughtful attention of the legis- '
lative body.

CAREER OF "SCONCHIN"
MALONEY HAS CLOSED.
JAMES J. MALONEY, Whose Strange Life Has Ended.
SCONCHIN MALONEY Is dead. There are few people in San Francisco
who did not know "Sconchln" and, with all hi.- eccentricities* and ag
gressiveness. there are few t!>at do not have for him a thought of kind
ness and. for his passing, a feeling of regret. As the final summons wan
about to be made for him he raid that he was leaving the world without
bitterness and without protest., "There are few ties left for me," he said,
"and 1 am not sorry to go. I have lived perhaps a thousand lives and I
have never intcm.onally wronged a man In mv hfe."
He was one of the peculiar characters of San Franclsin life. Without
education, influence or assistance he forced himself Into circles that a major
ity of Men find exclusive. If not accepted as an associate he was more than
tolerated by men of affairs. Ho wan not an unwelcome companion for law
yers. Judges, artors, politicians and public characters. His figure was a m
mlliar cue for years at conventions. .Legislatures and places where men con
gregate. He was known to thos^ who controlled the political parties of the
State and his services In more than one capacity were considered worthy of
employment. He was not considered too boisterous to be employed in matter*
of confidence by such men as Fred Crocker, Creed Haymond and A. N.
Towne.
Beneath hi* rough and ready exterior and behind hi? noisy, aggressive, In
sistent personality there was a shrewdness ihat made him something very
different from what he seemed. Now he was an extra man in the local Flro
Department, living a haphazard, reckless, improvident life, ready always for
a brawl or a tilt of tongues, in which his ready and none too refined wit
made him an antagonist to be feared. Again he was a follower of Brady
and Mannlx and Bill Hlgglns In the old time political camps of primary poll
tics, where success was more readily won by smashing heads than casting
ballots.
As time passed the peculiar value of "Sconchin" In certain fields became
known beyond the mountains and during the second campaign of Preslde-.t
Harrison he was called East to work among the saloons and cafes and the
tenderloin of New York. It was not wise to oppose him. for If ho failed in
the weapons that made the fishwives of Billingsgate famous he had his ready
fists and would fight anything that walked. But his New York experience
was his undoing. A life, without rare or future was telling upon him. He
had done much for others and nothing for himself. Occasional employ
ment in the offices of city. State and Federal friends had given htm no op
portunity to provide for future necessities and when consumption seized htm
he came home to die.
James J. Ifalonejr was born in Ireland in October, ISSI. He left his birth
place when he was 14 years of age for New York and his family soon followed
him. The entire family then migrated to this State, settling at Napa. where
a rfln^h was purchased. "Sconchin" was apprenticed to a blacksmith, but
disliking the work he came to this city and secured a position as extramun
in the Fire Department. It was there that he received hi* sobriquet of
"Sconchin." The Modoc war was in progress at that time and "Sconchin."
the chief of the tribe, was extremely warlike. As Malor.ey showed traits dis
agreeably similar to the chief he was dubbed "Sconchin," much to his dis
gust.
It was not long before he was a well-known character throughout trie
city. His volubility, eccentricity, Impulsiveness and remarkable knowledgt
of Shakespearean lines made him a character unique if not altogether pleas
ant. And so he lived until consumption took him away from the scenes of
political life, from hotel corridors and lobbies, from the streets and theaters.
As l).- grew weaker he went to hi* brothers at Napa, where he was kindly
cared for. but where, after his lite of excitement, he found no rest. Then he
went to his mother in Oakland, nut again the longing for change oppressed
him. Then through the provision of his brothers he went to St. Mary's Hos
pital and finally to the French Hospital, whoro on Tuesday night he died.
His body was taken yesterday to Napa, where, in obedience to his wish, he
will be buried among scenes that, tailed out remembrance of his early life.
CROOKS RAID A
CAR BY A NEW
CLEVER DEVICE
Sham Fight the Cover
for Robbery.
PASSENGERS LOSE DIAMONDS
NIPPERS AT WORK IN THE
EXCITEMENT.
Three desperate crooks made a clever
haul on a Powell street car shortly before
midnight last night. After boarding the
car the men engaged In a fake light.
Seated in the car at the time
were Joseph M. Rothchlld, the well
known attorney, and about a dozen
other passengers. While two of the
crooks wore pretending to be engaged
In a real fight their companion, with the
aid of a pair of nippers, was deftly re
moving the diamonds that adorned the
Shirt fronts of the excited crowd that
occupied the car. The screams of the
women passengers attracted, the atten
tion of policemen Fennell and Sylvester,
and as they started to board the car the
daring crooks quickly alighted and ran
along Powell street. One of the. men was
captured after â  short chase and taken
to police headquarters. To Captain
Witt man he said his name was Joe
Mack and that ho had recently arrived
from New York. â¢ â¢ .â¢Â
He emphatically denied that he knew
the men who "worked" the passengers,
and that be had anything to do with the
bold crime. He was locked, up .in . the
tanks pending further Investigation.
Mr. Rothchlld was robbed of a valuable
diamond stud while looking at the pre
arranged scrap, while another, man.
; whose name was not ascertained, lost a
gold watch. Several women were relieved
of diamond pins and other articles of
Jewelry.
As soon as the daring crime was re
ported to Captain Wlttman he detailed
all his available men in citizens' clothes
to round up the desperate crooks. They
visited the various haunts of criminals
in the tenderloin district, but without get
ting a trace of them.
The police believe that the. men arc
Eastern thieves, and every effort will be
made to run them down.
At a late hour the police captured
George Reed, an ex-messenger boy, who
recently served time, as connected with
the bold crime.

EXPECTORATED WHEN
POLICE WERE PRESENT
Policeman J. H. Colen was swinging
along in his usual jaunty fashion on
Grant avenue yesterday as the shades of
evening were falling. Suddenly he heard a
barking noiuc and his detective instincts
taught him to peel his weather eye and
look diagonally across the street to the
northeast corner of Grant avenue and
Butter streets. There was a man In the
very act of breaking the city ordinance
concerning expectoration upon the 'city's
pavements. Colen traveled fast and laid
the heavy hand of law upon the man's
arm and nut him under arrest. Then he
rang up for the patrol wagon from the
box.
A crowd gathered and people discussed
the case and the ordinance while they
waited for the wagon. A stout individual
saw the crowd and came across the street
vigorously pulling at a cigarette.
"Hello, there." said he, taking a puff
at his cigarette and then clearing his
throat and spitting vigorously on the
pave, "I say, what are you arresting that
man for?"
Policeman Snowball was close at hand.
"He's being arrested for the same thing
that you are." said Snowball , "for viola
tion of the expectoration ordinance."
That was a surprise party Indeed. The
new comer had to go into the California
street station when the police patrol wag
on came. He was as mad as a wot hen
The police last night took hold of the
enforcement of the expectoration ordi
nances more vigorously than they did the
night before and made many more ar
rests. Before 9 o'clock the following were
under arrest: Charles Bush, Frank Col
lins. John Patton. George Cole It A
Weeks. I/ouis Frlger, John Swnrts' v"
Malatesta. Joseph Burke, Peter Blacken
Albert Melnsrth and B. Fischer. It is siid
posed that they will all be let go after
they have been warned this morning by
the court. Arrests will be made for some
time.
Fred Mullls, an Ironmolder, arrested
Tuesday night for expectorating on the
sidewalk in front of 765 Market street
where he lives, by Policemen P c'
Murphy and J. C. Lawes, appeared before
Judge Graham yesterday and was con
victed, admonished and told not to do It
again. J. L, Ramsner, who was arrested
by the same officers, pleaded before Judge
Treadwell that he was a stranger In the
city and did not know there was such an
ordinance in existence. The Judge told
him that Ignorance was no excuse, but
