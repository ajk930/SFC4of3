PARIS, Aug. 15.â Any one ap
proaching the rue de Chabrol ; .to- |
night about 10 o'clock would Im- i
agine that Paris was in a state i
of eiege. A hundred yards below
the church of Saint Vincent de Paul a
double line of police and Republican
Guards barred the passage and- behind
them, drawn up alongside the pave
ment, could be seen a couple of dozen
mounted guards standing by their
horses. The immense staircase of the
church and all the streets behind the
lines of police were black with people J
indulging in loud shouts ,-of "Vive
Geurin," "Vive l'Armee," and occa
sionally singing in chorus "Un e'est
Geurin. Geurin. Geurin. C'est Geurin
qu'il nous faut." . - : ; -.
In the center of the square in front
of the church were the conspicuous
gold epaulets of the officers of the Re
publican Guard and silver-laced uni
forms of officers of police as they
walked up and down, keeping an eye
on the ever-growing crowd and occa
Monally issuing an order to their sub
ordinates. ' .*:
At the top of the rue d'Hautevllle
there was a second line of police and
Republican Guards, and yet a third at
the junction of that street and rue de
chabrol. Beyond this line lay the anti- |
Semitic fortress, while a hundred yards
further up the street yet another strong
line was established.
In front of the Church of Saint Vin
cent de Paul a company of Republican
Guards were posted. The men had piled
their arms and were seated on the eÂ«lÂ«re
of the pavement and lower steps await
ing developments. The rue d'Haute
ville, behind the police lines, was filled ;
with a squadron of mounted troops
stationed there. The men were either
seated on chairs lent them by the con- j
cierges of neighboring houses or j
tramping up and down beside their
horses.
At the anti-Jewish stronghold itself I
everything was quiet when the corres
pondent visited it at 10 o'clock. With
the exception of a little group of Jour- j
nalists-gathered on the opposite pave- j
ment there was not a soul in sight.
M. Jules Geurin. wearing his familiar |
broad-brimmed felt bat. was leaning i
on the window sill smoking a cirgar- ;
ette.- From time to time another mem
ber of the garrison would appear at
the window, reconnoiter the situation, i
and disappear. - =/-
Since 4 o'clock in the morning the
position of M. Geurin, from a legal
point of view, had changed. At that
moment M. Hamard, Commissary of j
Police, accompanied by his secretary,
arrived from the prefecture at the corner j
of rue de Chabrol and. rue Lafayette. I
There he left the carriage, bound on his
tricolor sash of office, advanced to the I
door of the.building of the anti-Semitic
League, arid rang the bell. For a mm- !
ute or two there, was no reply, but ;
sounds could be heard within, mingled j
with shouts of "En alerte comrades, |
are you ready? Every man to his post, j
Let no one act without orders," and the !
famous tocsin of the."occidentale" be- j
gan to clang.
An instant later a slide covering the
grating in the door was shot aside and !
a voice asked, "Who are you?"
"I am M. Hamard, Commissary of
Police," replied that magistrate, "and
The San Francisco Call
I come In the name .of law to execute
a warrant for the arrest of. Jules
Geurin.". â¢ . â¢
"All right,"' answered the man on the.
other side. â¢ and' again shot, the slide
over the grating. :
At the same instant a window on the
first floor was opened, and M. Geurin'
appeared. "What do you want?" he
asked Hamard.
"1 am a Commissary of Police. Come
down; I want to serve on you, in the'
name of law, a warrant for your ar
rest."
"I refuse," shouted Geurin. "Ive-i
fuse; I refuse."
"Well, then." replied Hamard, "I de-i
clare you and your companions in re- :
bellion against law."
As he said the words, M. Hamard
stepped down, folded up the warrant
and slipped it under the door. Geurin
seemed for an instant somewhat curi
ous, and leaned over the window sill to
see what, he was doing. As the com
missary turned away he tried to resume â 
the conversation. Hamard refused- to
listen and moved off toward the 'â¢ car
riage. ; â â¢*, ,v/V/ I
"You won't listen to me, then?"
shouted Geurin. "I don't care. I had
only one word â¦<-> say. You want to
take us. And France, which is with us,
will you take that, too?"
The crowd outside, which had hither
to listened in silence, burst into cheers
and shouts of "Bravo," "Vive Geurin."
"Death to Jews."
Before quitting the Rue de Chabrol.
Hamard gave orders to his men to in
stantly arrest any one who should try
to enter or leave the anti-Semitic fort
ress. About 8 o'clock Geurin and a
number of his friends appeared at the
window and called out to the crowd
below to throw up the morning papers,
which was done. \
"Croissants" and small loaves fol
lowed the same route, and the anti- I
Semitic chief engaged in conversation j
with friends below.
About 3 o'clock M. Lepine, Prefect of.
Police, the colonel of the Republican ;
Guards and a number of officers ap- \
peared on tht scene and reconnoitered â¢
the neighborhood. This gave rise to a
report that the authorities intended to
storm the anti-Semitic stronghold be- |
fore morning. Opinions are divided as
to the resistance that will be made. If
the proclamation issued by Geurin and
his friends is to be believed, desperate
resistance may be expected. It runs
as follows: ; -
Appeal to all patriotsâ Citizens: A hand
ful of men determined to enforce respect
for liberty of Individuals by a Government
capable of every infamy will to-morrow,
August 13, sacrifice their lives for the
cause of liberty of opinion. Will the peo
ple of Paris understand the high signifi
cance of the act which those men are go
ing to accomplish, and v.ill they either
make common cause with them or | will
they let them struggle single-handed
against the Government, which is execut
ing the orders of cosmopolitan Jewdom?
Citizens, whatever may happen, the anti-
Juifs shut up in the grand Occident of
France will Co their duty. Those who are
ready to die- for the cause of liberty Salute
JULES GEURIN AND HIS COM
RADES. ;,^y; â¢'â â¢
On the other hand many people be
lieve that this proclamation is not to
be taken "au pied de la lettre," and that
when the critical moment comes better
counsels will prevail.

THUGS HOWARD HIRED TO KILL
GREEN ROBBED THE ALAMEDA
Jimmie Murphy, Jimmie Kelly and Jackie Casey Spent Money Right
and Left During Their Stay in This City.
A Second-Hand Store on Pacific Street
Looted of Keys to Enable Them to
Get Into the Steamer's Treasure Chest
Had They Been Unable to Land
the Money They Had a Plan to Fix the
Guilt on the Denver Capitalist,
CHARLES DOYLE, alias Augns
. tus Howard, alias ''Plunger
Hill, wanted by the police for the
: embezzlement of the money of Wil
lard Reed Green, a Denver capitalist,
is still at liberty. It is supposed he
iis headed for Mexico. The police say
he left last Thursday. His wife says
she saw him for the last time Sunday
i
night.
The story told by Green is only a
chapter in a criminal romance in
which Howard is the principal actor.
The police are certain that, if he did
not plan the robbery of the steamer
Alameda, men he had employed to
put Green out of the way did. They j
are known. Their names are Jimmie
Murphy, Jimmie Kelly and Jackie j
Casey, and all did time with Howard
In the Antipodes. The police claim to !
have an absoluts case against them
also for the robbery of the Welis-
Fargo Express wagon some months
ago of $2500 as it stood outside the ;
company's offices. Casey and Kelly ,
are supposed to be in China. Mur
phy's whereabouts is unknown.
Howard's criminal record, taken
from the Australian police records,
has been produced by Chief Lees and
brands the man of many aliases as
a persistent criminal. The police are
also in possession of information that
the man was a sensual monster, using
his relationship and violating his
own home to debauch several of the
members of his wife's family.
Attorney Beatty. on the other
hand, pooh poohs the story of the
police and threatens, if it becomes
necessary, to show up matters which
will not redound to the credit of Cap
italist Green.
Certainly a pretty kettle of fish
has been overturned on the trail of
the Alameda robbers.
DETECTIVES hidden behind
the curtains to the windows of
the residence of Chief of Po
lice Lees, 1022 Pine street, kept
their eyes glued yesterday on
the house across the way, where Au
gustus Howard, alias "Plunger Hill,"
real, name Charles Vivian Doyle, has
his fanfnty. They ; were anxious for a
sight.. of ihini. In their pockets they
carriejd: the three, warrants sworn out
Saturday- by Wiliard EL. Green, the
millionaire promoter of Denver, who
claims to have been victimized to the
extent of $150,000 by the man of many
aliases.
The vigil of the detectives was not
rewarded. They were satisfied from
their search of Monday night that
Howard was not in the house, and up
until 3 o'clock this morning they saw
no one that bore the slightest resem
blance to him approach the premises.
They are confident, as they first con
cluded, that their bird has flown, and
must await the turn of events to throw
him again in their way.
The story told by Green and the polica
after Monday night's attempt to rap
ture Howard contains material for half
a dozen melodramas, with enough left
over to furnish f rth a fairy tale, but it.
is only a small part of ;i chronicle of
crime that re-ds like a romance and is
unequaled in criminal annals.
Doyle, alias Howard, alias "Plunger
Hill. "to begin nt t.he beginning, was the
arch criminal. Associated with him
i were three Australian . convicts' with
| whom he had "done time" in the col
-1 enies b.eforis he broke jail and came to
i America with his British naval cap
tain's uniform. Their names are Jim
mie Murphy, Jimmie Kelly and Jackie
Casey- their aliases and their exploits
i cover many a page in the police
archives of the Antipodes. They are
the men who looted the treasure room
of the Alameda on her last May-June
trip to San Francisco, getting away\
j with 5000 so- :reigns. ; : : :
Murphy. Kelly and Casey came to
; San Francisco last November at the in
] vitation of Howard and on the prom
: ise of something good. They were sup
| plied by him with money, which they
j spent lavishly in the saloons and other
; resorts of their class in the tenderloin.
They made their headquarters at the
saloon of Billy Lyons. 218 Post street.
and were great friends with Teddy
Alexander, the one-time manager of j
"Griffo" and Joe Goddard, an Austra- '
lian like themselves. Some of the
money with which Millionaire Green of
Denver had supplied Howard went to :
keep up their revels and. when Howard i
got ready to put Green out of the way.
they were the men selected to do the
deed.
Howard a Master Plotter.
Howard showed himself a master
plotter in this, as he did in all his
other relations with Green. His tools]
were criminals unknown to the police
or. this side of the Pacific, and when â 
their work was completed it was sup
posed they would drop out of sight
and leave the projector of the plot free
to do as he chose.
Twenty thousand dollars was the !
price Howard put upon the I
head of Green, and for that
sum the three Australians agreed |
to make the Denver man food
for the fishes. In order to do this they
had to know their man. Howard ar
ranged all that, (m the eve of the de- :
parture of the steamer Alameda Green :
was invited to a dinner at Hdward's
Pine-street residence. Howard in his j
captain's uniform, Mrs. Howard In her
PRICE FIVE CEKTS.
best and Mis<= Bessie Lee. her sister,
sat to table with the millionaire. Dur
ing- the dinner Casey and Kelly called
at the house and had a chance to set a
good view of Green as he left with Mrs.
Howard and her sister for the theater.
Then they went clown to the dock, os
tensibly to board the Alameda. upon
whi<-h Howard and Green had state
rooms reserved.
Twenty Thousand in Gold.
Late that same afternoon Howard
and Jimmie Murphy in a hack driven
by John Fitzpatrick, with Frank Kelly,
son of the Pine-street liveryman, on the
box, were driven up to the bank in the
Flood building from his brrx in which
Howard took a sack containing $2O,onr>
in gold coin. Re-entering the hack, he
drew down the blinds and rode with
Murphy to the courtyard of the Palace
Hotel, where he got out, leaving the
convict in charge of the money. How
ard then went to keep his dinner en
gagement with the man he intended to
have murdered, and accompanied him
to the Mail dock when he returned from
the theater.
It was the intention of Howard and
of the. criminals he had employed to
km.-ck Green on the head at the wharf
and throw him overboard, in which
event Howard would have gone on the
Alameda and sailed away. This plan
was frustrated by the presence of Mr.
Porter, cousin to Green's wife, who had
come dwvn to the dock to see him off.
It was then decided that Howard
should not sail, and in order to make a
plausible excuse he telephoned for one
of his creatures, Eddie Kauffman, to
come down and represent himself as an
officer with a warrant for his arrest.
Kauffman appeared in due time,
served the fictitious warrant and grve
Howard the opportunity he was seek
ing to tell Green that he had been ar
rested as a result of litigation over the
famous running horse Yellowtail and
would have to make other arrangements.
This satisfied Green, especially after
Howard had given him a promise that
as soon as possible he would .go up to
"Victoria and ta" c one of the steamers
for Australia sailing from that port to
join him.
It was Howard's nlan that Murphy,
Casey and Kelly should sail on the
steamer with Green, and when well out
to sea sandbag and throw him over
board. He saw the Alamedr steam out
â of port, fin i in the conviction that
Green was a doomed man, and that
Murphy. Casey and Kelly would leave
no telltale tracks behind them. Sev
eral weeks later Casey and Kelly called
upon Howard, told him that they had
disposed of Green on the way to Hono
lulu and had taken the steamer Aus
tralia back from that port to get the
remainder of the $20,000 blood money.
They said that Murphy had gone to
Australia. Howard paid them the
money and they stayed around the city
spending it until May 17, when they
sailed away again.
Casey and Kelly had betrayed the
arch criminal. They had not thrown
Green overboard, as they stated. They
had voyaged with him to Honolulu,
without molesting him on the way,
whether from lack of opportunity or
not is not known. Xot daunted by their
failure and bcins low in funds, they de
cided to come back and claim the
money before Green, as he did. cabled
to Howard his safe arrival in Australia.
Their companion, Jimmie Murphy,
sailed on to perfect plans for the rob
bery of the steamer Alameda, in which
they were to join him.
The Steamer Robbery.
The first real step toward the robbery
of the Alameda was taken March 2 last.
the very day that steamer arrived from
Australia on one of her up-trips. On
! that day Murphy called at a second-
I hand store on Pacific street, near. East.
! kept by a man named Williams, and
; asked to be shown some keys for Yale
locks. He was shown a large ring on
which were fastened some 300. He care
fully examined the bunch and conclud
, ed his visit by purchasing half a dozen
lof them. That same night the second
' hand store was entered by thieves, and.
' strange to say, nothing was stolen but
'â  this bunch of Yale lock keys. Murphy
needed them to gain access to the treas
ure room of the Alameda. or any other
jof the steamers that plowed the Pa
cific.
How well he succeeded in using them
! is shown by the story of the robbery of
the Alameda. which became public here
i on the next time the vessel arrived in
port. Her treasure room had been vio
lated and no trace had been left behind
by the thieves, or thief, for Murphy had
done the. job alone, until he got to
Honolulu, where he was met by Casey
and Kelly, who had gone there to rejoin
him for that purpose.
Green was on the vessel on that up
trip, full of indignation at the fraud2
MISS BESSIE LEE, HOWARD'S SISTER-IN-LAW.
Howard had put upon him, and ready
to wreak vengeance on the man of
many aliases whom he had cabled udoii
his arrival in Sydney that he was all
right. And right here, it is certain that
Green came nearer being the victim of
a desperate criminal plot than he was

Disposal of the Booty.
Murphy had figured hfs chances down
'fine. He had entered the treasure-room
â  of the Alanirda. after the steamer had
left. Auckland and had abstracted the
5000 .sovereigns. 'â  The question , then
was to gel away with the booty. H n

character. He had given money to one
of his creatures c with" which to imper

â  another, George Adams, ho had. in
trUsted the task of spreading , abroad
the story that the real reason Howard
did not sail on the Alameda with Green
was because that individual had been
warned that Green had hired thugs to

Howard as a Capitalist.
The remainder of the story, of How
ard's attack on Green, of his threats
of murder and suicide and. finally of his
promises to return the money out of
which he had swindled the Denver
man was told Monday night in Attor
ney Pillsbury's room in the Palace Ho
tel. Additional light was thrown yes
terday on the figure Howard has cut in
this city and In Australia before he
Came here. His criminal record in
black and white is in the hands of
Chief of Police Lees. He was a known
swindler In Australia, convicted at
that, and once sentenced to serve five
years for a crime. He put in nine
months of that imprisonment and
broke jail to come to this country,
Where such good things as Green seem
to be pretty plentiful.
Right and left he swindled people
with his gas machine. The "front" he
put up, especially with his bogus cap
tain's uniform, caught more people and
Just as wise as Capitalist Green. He
talked such people as Alvinza Hay
ward, Winthrop Lester and Thomas B.
Bishop, the well-known attorney, into
his net, it is said, for good round .sums.
Later they found out their man and he
was made to restore the money out o-f
, which, he had swindled them. x
Howard spent nloney right and left.
He bought wire for anybody and every
body at every place. He drove the fin
est rigs and he associated with the best
people, He â â <:â  very extravagant- and
seemed to have "no, end of funds. Fer In
stance, it ie known that for a long time
he paid George Green, the boxer, $50 a
week- for boxing lessons, and then took
only one lesson a week. Green said yes
terday that Howard was a very handy
man With the mitts. The "plunger"
gave Green carte blanche on half a
dozen saloons In town for all the wino
he wanted and frequently chided the
pugilist because he did not consume
enough champagne. He also gave Green
an order on Kelly's stable for any rig
he wanted at any. time.
Iron Hand' of the Law.
And so if wentâ Green's, of course
and the Denver man v.as pressing for
a settlement. Howard promised and
threatened and promised again and
again, until Attorney Plllsbury, tiring
of the game he saw was being played,
resolved to wait no longer and caused
the , issuance of the warrant*? for the
arrest of the Australian. When they
went to serve them the police found
that their man was gone.
It is supposed that Howard left the
city last Thursday, but Chief Lees and
Detective Thomas Gibson,' who has had
the Alameda robbery, investigation in
charge, are given to the belief that he
has not gone far. His wife says that
he was at the house Sunday night,
since which time she has not seen him.
. Mrs. Howard was considerably
alarmed Monday night at the police
raid on her house, and became ill as a
result of the excitement. Her condi
tion was not improved yesterday morn
ing when she read the disclosures made
by Detective Tom Gibson and Mr.
Green. She immediately sent a mes
sage to Mr. Green at the Palace Hotel
and asked him to call upon her. He re
fused to call, but said he would be
pleased to talk with her if she would
< all upon him at the hotel. Mrs. How
ard replied that she would do so, and
made an appointment with Mr. Green
for 2 o'clock. At that time, instead of
railing, she sent a note stating that she
would be unable to see him till 4 o'clock,
and before that hour had arrived she
again telephoned him that she had
thought better of he'r determination. and
would not see him Just at present.
Green himself put in most of the day
at the office of his attorney. E. S. Pills

Howard's Wife Is Brave.
Unrest ard sorrow have come to Au
gustus Howard's pretty home at 1025 j
Pine street. All day yesterday the door
bell was rung by inquiring newspaper
men and sympathetic callers, but few
saw the wife of the absent "capitalist."
The publication of the facts of her hus
band's alleged fraudulent operations!
has unstrung Mrs. Howard. Deep rings ]
around her eyes and a haggard expres
sion on her face indicate the mental
strain she has been laboring under dur
ing the past twenty-four hours. She
was attired in deep mourning out of
respect to a departed loved one, and
Ivr somber clothes only emphasized her
sorrowful appearance. To a represen
tative of The Call she stated last night
that the presence of the detectives in
her home on Monday night had^ been a
terrible Bhock to her; that she wonders
whether she is suffering from a horrid
dream, and often thinks that she will
wake and find it all unreal.
â¢] was M glad My. Beatty was here
when those horrid men entered mv
doors," she said. "Had I been alone I
i?" not know what 1 should have done.
The presence of these men searching
for my husband completely unnerved
me and 1 was compelled to seek my
room for repose. 1 assured the officers
on my word of honor that Mr. Howard?]
was not in the house and had not been
home since Sunday, but they ignored
my statement. When I picked up the
paper this morning and saw the article
about my husband 1 simply lay back
oh my pillow and was unable to grasp
its meaning for nearly two hours.
Whenever 1 close my eyes I seem to see
tho black print that speaks of murder,
fraud and other terrible things.
"1 could not stand the strain, and at
once telephoned Mr. Green to know
what it all meant. I talked with him
over the telephone, and asked him to
come and explain. ThÂ»n I thought of
the murder story, and ] said you can
bring some one with you. I was afraid
Mr. Green might think 1 was trying to
bring him here to Injure him; that is
why J told him to bring some one along.
He answered that under the circum
stances he could not come to the house,
but stated hir-> willingness to meet me
at the hotel. When the hour of our ap
pointment drew near I was unable to
leave the house on account of my weak
condition.
"1 have not seen or heard from Mr.
Howard since Sunday night. This must
all be- a mistakeâ this story of his being
a Mr. Doyle. It Is surely a case of mis
taken identity. The dates are so dif-

VOYAGE OF THE TRANSPORT SHERMAN
WITH THE RETURNING CALIFORNIA BOYS
THE transport Sherman, if nothing wont wrong with her machinery, crossed the 180 th meridian yesterday and
is now in west longitude. According to the figures supplied The Call by J. T. McMillan, United States nautical

She was sixteen years old when the
handsome naval lieutenant visited her

Attorney Beatty's Statement.
W. A. Beatty of the firm of Short
: ridge & Beatty, attorneys for Mr. How
-1 ard, made the following statement to
I The Call last night: \& .-:
"Chief Lees is absolutely mistaken in
his statement of Mr. Howard's record
which he furnished the newspapers last
night. He has undoubtedly confused
some criminal with my client. As a
I matter of fact, Howard is a man be
; tween 35 and 40 years of age. Accord
ing to the statement given by the police
the man Doyle, they claim to be How
ard, must be at least 45 years, of age.
; Howard as a matter of fact was born
in India, not in Australia at all. He
was in the British naval service and re
j signed from that some years ago be
j cause of his health. He visited Califor
; nia.; at the time Kellogg was shot as a
I midshipman on a British man-of-war.
'. He was never in jail in Sydney. He was
1 never arrested In Australia, either for
. obtaining money under false pretenses
or any other crime." : He was never in
j jail in any part of Australia. He is not
j now a fugitive from justice nor is there
! a sentence hanging over him in Aus
tralia. Nor are extradition papers on
the way from Australia.
"Howard came to San Francisco five
or six years ago. He has lived- in this
city and vicinity almost . continuously
ever since. He returned on a visit to
I Australia a year or more ago with his
wife and family. He put up at the best
; hotel In Melbourne â he lived for a long
â  time at the Hotel Metropole in Sydney.
1 Before he left Australia he was known
.as Augustus Howard, his true name,
and when he visited that country a
j year or so ago he registered as Augus
i tvs Howard, and was known ?by no
other name than Augustus Howard.
"In 1897 Mr. Howard was arrested in
San Francisco for obtaining a piece of
j Iron used In an invention of his of the
! value of $7 10 by fraud. The man who
I caused his arrest refused to swear to
! a warrant to the complaint and the
trial Judge and Prosecuting Attorney
both declared that it was entirely and
absolutely unwarranted. Mr. Howard,
1 as far as I know, has swindled no
body out of small amounts of money.

DAWSONITES WITH
SACKS OF GOLD
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 15.â The
steamship Cutch arrived this evening
from Skaguay with over 100 passengers
and in the neighborhood of $350,000 in
gold dust aboard. Her passengers left
Dawson on August 2. The principal
gold winners among them were J. C.
Burk and J. D. Rockwell of, Los An
geles, who had $150,000 between them;
Flossy Barrett and Mrs. Barrett, who
own a claim on El Dorado, and Jo
seph Vincent, a big property owner of
St. Louis. Vincent had $100,000, while
the . thers who made up the passenger
list aggregated in the vicinity of an
other $100,000 in lots of a few thousand
each.
Vincent has a deal on with J. Haddo,
another passenger, the discoverer and
principal claim owner of Thistle Creek.
He will pay a half million dollars for a
collection of claims on this creek. Vin-.
cent is out now to buy thawing ma- :
Hiiiies and will start for San Fraivis- :
<Â i"-ni"rfow to purchase hydraulic .
ma' ilinery; â ':.. . V . ;
Vim. in is fl. close friend of "Klondike ;
Kit;--;'" McDonald, and he says that, ai
fho.ugjb n â â¢ ollt -ial announcement :has
been -made,: it is common property
around J>a\vs"'i that McDonald's flnan
ciai.- condition is not of the best. He
ha-s lately nut some very heavy cash
payments on varii us properties and re
cently paid over $400.0110 in gold dust to
the Alaska Commercial Company's
officers. This has left him for a while
wlthoUl ready cash, and what the re
sult will be upon the general condition
of his finances regaains to be seen.
George Hill, milting engineer, is a
San Francisco man who came down
from Omineca, in northern British Co
lumbia. He has been on the Edmon
ton all-Canadian trial to the Klondike,
and several times last winter starving
men \veri> given food and clothing-, at
his."e::mps in the snow-covered: diStricti
thrVi/mli which they passed. Hill:was
s. Tit in last year by San Francisco peo-\
i.ile to locate old hydraulic ground. He
sen} nut several prospectors and ob
tained some fine property near Manson--
Creek. The holding extends for Âs<\v T I
eral miles, and its principal fefttu.re.j
consists in its being operated by an |
overflow from Cariboo Lake. -The
creek has h^en dammed, and Mr. Hill
claims the whole property is very rich.
All over the best parts of the bed of .
the creek nans have b^-en taken out
gojng as high as $F.O each in gold. The !
property will be operated by machinery j
and sluicing will be done by the fall
from the lake.
Several rich strikes of gold and cop
per have been made on the Sksena
River, Mr. Hill says, and several bonds
have been made by Kootenal mine
owners. .:.
sesslon, cohering innumerable busi- I
ness dealings of his, I have found
during the day receipts from
him showing payments of money to
the people mentioned as having been
defrauded by him.- We have advised
Mr. Howard that he is neither civilly
nor criminally liable for any transac
tion that he had with Mr. Green. They
were jointly interested in a large num
ber of patents (and also in this shale
land proposition. Green knew that
Howard did not own the shale lands all
during his dealings concerning them.
it seems to us a preposterous proposi
tion that a man who is lauded to bo
as shrewd as Mr. Green would come
now and ask anybody to. believe that
he paid $iriO,Ooo for some lands that he
had never Been, of which he knew noth
ing ami which were situated more than :
four or five thousand miles away from
his residence. As a matter of fact, j
from what we know of Mr. Howard and j
his record we do not fear comparison !
with Willard R. Green. When these j
eases are tried, if they ever are tried, j
we have in our possession a large quan
tity of evidence about Mr. Green, the
prosecuting witness here, and we ex
pect to produce it.
"The sleuth story told by Detective j
Gibson and his confreres of murder and ,
sudden death on the Alameda reads like i
a messenger boy's dime novel. Tt Is ab- |
solutely without foundation. The case ;
of Howard seems to be the case of any |
man who gets into serious trouble in â 
San Francisco. He is blamed for every- â 
thing that Is discovered in the criminal
line; for example, the robbery of the
$2f)00 from Wells-Fargo's messenger;
wagon and the 5000 guineas from the ;
steamship Alameda, are both laid to
Howard because the true culprits have
not bo n discovered.
"The main warrants that are issued
for Mr. Howard's arrest are on two
chargesâ one of embezzlement and the j
other of obtaining money on false pre- j
tenses. As a matter of fact, the same
transaction and the same money are
involved in both charges, a different
amount being named. This, of course,
is done for the purpose of placing How
ard in a position making it impossible
for him to raise the bail required. When
Mr. McDonald was arrested for steal
ing several million dollars from the
People's Bank his bail was only $100,000.
while Howard is expected to furnish
cash ball in excess of that amount.
"We have not advised Mr. Howard
or suggested to him at any time that
he leave the city because of these
charges. We, on the contrary, have al
ways advised him that ho had nothing
to fear from them except, perhaps, the
Inconvenience of being detained in the
City Prison for a few days. We know
that Mr. Howard had arranged for a
bail of reasonable amount when his ar
rest was threatened. Where he is now.
I do not know. Mr. Howard Is over 21
years of age and will decide himself
whether he should surrender to the
tolice."

fused to allow the wallet to be taken
out of his hands, putting it under his
head for a pillow and holding 1 it with
one hand. The coat was'shortly after
ward put on again. On arriving at his
residence M. Lab<Â»ri asked his wife to
look into the pockets and see if the
contents were safe. Mme. Laborl found
the pockets completely empty. Luckily
no papers of importance were in the
pockets, which only contained personal
letters, including menacing letters re
ceived on the previous day. The rifling
of the lawyer's pockets of the papers
and the attempt to steal his wallet,
while no effort was made to appropri
ate his watch or money, are regarded
as clear evidence of a plot in which
several men were implicated. The nan
wT\o actually fired the shot, it appears,
was only one part of the machinery of
the conspirators.
In spite of the extensive search made
for the would-be assassin, hr is still
at large, and the impression Is gaining
ground that he is being altfed by the
anti-Dreyfus country people.
The doctors in attendance upon M.
Labori have sent to Paris for an X-ray
apparatus in order to locate the bullet.

REED MAY REMAIN TO
OPPOSE EXPANSION
There Is Also Talk of Having the Former
Speaker Head a "Continental"
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, "WASHING
TON, Aug. 15.â Former Speaker Reed's return to the United States
has revived the talk of his remaining in the House of Representa
tives and opposing the administration policy of expansion from the
floor. Representative Warner of Illinois, who is one of the most
earnest Republican advocates of "taking all we can get and holding on to
all that we take," said to-day that while he did not pretend to have any
information on the subject, it was his opinion that Mr. Reed will retain
his membership in the House. He said that he believed the former
Speaker, finding himself out of harmony with his party on expansion
and other important issues, had decided that he could not in honor re
tain the Speakership, and that he had, therefore, decided to take his
place on the floor and advance his views to the best of his ability.
Some plausibility is given to Mr. Warner's opinion by the fact that
Mr. Reed has not yet resigned hi.Â« seat in the House of Representatives,
nor has he made any public declaration of his intention of returning to
Congress, for his private secretary, Amos Allen, has let it be understood
that Mr. Reed would resign in due time, and that he (Mr. Allen) would be
a candidate for the Republican nomination in the district. Some of the
midsummer political gerssip h^re goes much further than Mr. Warner has
done, and Senator Clay of Georgia, a Democrat, who would hardly be in
the confidence of the Republicans, is quoted as having expressed belief
that there would be an anti-expansion Republican ticket in the field for
the Presidency next year. According to this gossip, the new ticket is to
be called "The Continental Republican." and though it is not believed
that it will be possible to secure Mr. Reed's consent to head the ticket,
he is counted on as one of its most effective supporters. Former Secre
tary of the Treasury George S. Rout well of Massachusetts, who is high in
the counsels of anti-expansionists, is talked of as a "Continental" Re
publican candidate for the Presidency, and it is said that anti-expan
sionists with him at the head of the ticket would expect to prevent the
regular Republican ticket from carrying any one of the New England
States.

ARMY MATTERS
CONSIDERED
Activity Displayed by
Secretary Root.
Ppffi&l Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 15.â Secretary
Root gave his attention largely to army
matters to-day. He had long consulta
tions with Adjutant General Corbin
relative to the army, its strength,
i equipment and supplies, these being
considered in connection with the state
! ments that have been furnished by the
j heads* of the different bureaus. The
| question of enlisting and the selection
j of officers of the additional volunteer
regiments also was under considera
tion, but it was stated that no decision
to call for more troops was reached.
While it is said that five regiments will
be organized, the number has not been
: definitely determined upon. Neither is
it s- at led whether these shall be in
fantry regiments. It has been suggest
ed that another cavalry regiment or
t w " may be of great advantage in the
Philippines. The only objection to or
i ganizing two cavalry regiments is said
} to be the great difficulty and cost of
: transporting horses to the Philippines.
The rtH.'ruiting now going on will con
tinue. The new regiments may be or
; ganized at Some other points than
where the first ten have been stationed,
! as several localities are anxious to have
them.
The problem of transportation in the
! Philippines has been under considera-
I tion by the War Department for some
I time. It is expected that at the end of
the rainy season it will be necessary to
move the troops some distance from the
railroad, and at the present time the
means of transportation are not suffi
cient for a large army and extensive
! operations. The difficulty has been met
I by sending mules to Manila in large
j numbers. The quartermaster's depart
ment has already shipped about 800 of
these animals and will send 800 more
very soon. There are nearly 2000 more
owned by the department which will
;be sent if needed. These animals will
| not only be used for the transportation
, of supplies in wagons, but it is intended
i to organize a pack train for carrying
I guns and equipments where teams can
not be utilized. The Indications are
j that the campaign, after the rainy sea
-1 son, is to be conducted not only near
â¢ the railroad where General Otis has
: confined most of his operations, but the
I interior of Luzon will be penetrated.
FIGHT WITH A BURGLAR.
Lodi Citizen and a Midnight Prowler
Exchange Shots.
LODI, Aug. l.Vâ A murderous burglar
wns encountered at the racetrack saloon
early this morning. C. Yeilin. the pro
prietor, while sitting up with a si< k
friend near by, noticed a light in his room
at the saloon. He procured a shotgun
and saw the burglar drop from a window
and start to run. Yeilin gave him the
contents of the shotgun and started in
pursuit. As he was about to close in the
burglar turned and fired at him with a
revolver. Yeilin stopped and the robber
escaped In the darkness. It is thought
the burglar was wounded, but no trace
of him could be found.

HUNDREDS OF
BODIES BEING
RECOVERED
Additional Horrors of the
Devastating Porto Rican
Storm Made Known.
MANY ARE HOMELESS
Arecibo Was Completely Flooded,
Moravis Totally Destroyed and
Population Now Starving.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, ISÂ«9, by Jamea Gor
don Bennett.
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Aug. 15.â
Arecibo was devastated by a hurricane
and later was Hooded by the Arecibo
and Manati rivers. Two hundred
bodies have already been recovered and
hundreds more are missing. It is
thought they were swept into the sea.
The town was inundated to a depth of
six feet. After the water had subsided
the dead were found lying everywhere.
The bodies were buried on the spot
where they were found.
The town is now rapidly filling up
with starving persons from the coun
try. Only four soldiers were drowned,
but all are without shelter. Captain
McComb and his men did valiant serv
ice in saving life. Forty persons were
rescued from floating wreckage. One
thousand head of cattle were lost. At
Naranzito twenty persons are known
to have been killed. Thousands are
homeless and starving. Moravis is to
tally destroyed. At Ciales twenty per
sons were killed. Many are missing
at Barcelonita. Seven residents were
killed. At Cayey the death roll is
at least ninety. It is impossible
to estimate the loss of life and property
in country districts. Every river is
still swollen and passage is well-nigh
impossible. Crops are totally destroyed.
Children are dying by hundreds from
starvation and exposure. I rode for
miles through the Bayarr.on district
without a seeing a house standing. All
people are flocking to Bayamon for
food and shelter. A courier has just
arrived here from Yabucoa. He says
that the town was demolished by the
storm. Already eighty bodies have
been recovered, and it is estimated that
two hundred perished. Many are
wounded. Medical assistance is scarce
in all parts of the island. What makes
the present distress greater is the fact
th.it a month ago all public Improve
ments were stopped owing to lack of
appropriations. Thousands of persons
were then thrown out of employment.
The renewal of public works would be
a great relief. Many planters and mer
chants are ruined and cannot give em
ployment. I had an interview last
night with General Davis, who says
the latest reports show the disaster to
be greater than ho had anticipated and
that it extends over theÂ»whole island.

WASHINGTON. Aug. "15.â Orders have
been Issued by Acting Secretary Allen to
Captain Robley D. Evans, who command
ed the battleship lowa during the war
with Spain, directing that officer ttvo v con
fer with the Dewey reception committee
of New York and with Rear Admiral
Sampson, respecting the participation of
the navy in the ceremonies incident to
the home-coming of Admiral Dewey. Rear
Admiral Sampson has been directed to
prepare a programme to be Â° followed by
the ships of his squadron in the reception
of the admiral. This programme, before
being put into execution, will be approved
by the department, but the approval is
merely perfunctory as the suggestions of.
Admiral Sampson will undoubtedly be
adopted. . : *i''-
Admiral Sampson is also expected to
confer with the reception committee of
New York so that upon the days of the
Olympia's arrival there may be no con
fusion in the execution of the ceremonies
determined upon. It seems to be finally
decided that the North Atlantic squadron
will not go abroad to meet the Olympia.
but that Admiral Dewey v will be requested
to furnish the Navy Department, before
leaving the Azores, the route he will take
in crossing the Atlantic in order that Ad
miral Sampson's command may meet him,
perhaps within a day's sailing from New
It is the expectation of the Washington
reception committee that the sub-com
mittee, which it will send to New York,
will board the dispatch boat Dolphin and
meet the Olympia in the outer bay of New
York. It nas been suggested that possi
bly arrangements might be made for a
delegation of the crew of the Olympia to
accompany the admiral to Washington.
The committee has addressed a letter to
the admiral requesting him to advise
them as early as possible of the date of
his arrival here, so that, final arrange
ments can be made for meeting him in
New York with a special train.

MRS. LANGTRY
SECRETLY WED
Her Husband Is Hugo
Gerald de Bathe.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 15.â Mrs. Lily Lang
try, the actress, was married July 27
at the Island of Jersey to Hugo Gerald
de Bathe, 28 years of age, the eldest
son of Sir Henry Percival de Bathe,
baronet, a retired general and Crimean
veteran. The ceremony was private,
the only witness being Mrs. Langtry's
daughter. The Prince of Wales is said
to have been in the confidence of the
pair and he sent them a telegram of
congratulation. The weddihg occurred
the day "Mr. Jersey's" (Mrs. Lang
try's) horse Merman won the Good
wood cup. Sir Henry de Bathe has
seats in Devonshire, Sussex and County
Meath. to which the bridegroom is heir.
Sisters of the bridegroom are married
to Hurry McCulmOnt, Harry Lawsnn
and Sir Saville Brinton Crossley, baro
r.et.
The wedding will not interfere with
Mrs. Langtry's forthcoming season at
the Haymarket.
Mrs. Langtry, in an interview at the
theater, said to a reporter of the As
sociated Press, "Yes, it is quite true
I am married to Mr. de Bathe. The
wedding occurred very quietly at my
old church, St. Saviours, Island of Jer
sey, where my dear old father officiated
so often. It was pretty much in the
nature of a runaway match, as we kept
it to ourselves, hoping it would leak
i.ut gradually. I see the papers put me
down as 47 years old. Well, a few
years either way does not matter, but
I am only 39, for the old clerk at St.
Saviour's took my age from the church
register of births.
"I know nothing of Hugo's estates.
Indeed, I have not been thÂ»re. News
papers, as a rule, do not spare me and
have often criticized me when I did
not deserve it. The very idea of news
paper comment makes me nervous. I
hope the newspapers will speak nicely
of our wedding, now that the news has
leaked out.
"The Prince of Wales was, as he al
ways is, thoughtful. He remembered
us kindly by congratulations. But I
am sorry his name was mentioned, as
what he did was done privately and
out of pure friendship. Mr. Frohman
is arranging with me for an American
tour. I long to go, for I love the peo
ple of that country. Of course, my
husband will accompany me."

BROOKE CULLED
TO WASHINGTON
Asked to Consult With
Secretary Root.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 15.-General
Brooke will be called to Washington to
consult with Secretary Root concern
ing affairs in Cuba. The Secretary de
sires to have the benefit of General
Brooke's knowledge of things in the
island before he reaches any definite
conclusions as to a future policy for
Cuba. No date has been fixed for Gen
eral Brooke's visit, but it will no doubt
be determined by the developments of
the situation and before the Secretary
begins his annual report.
Colonel Kennon, Thirty-fourth In
fantry, recently appointed, but who has
been on duty at Havana as assistant
adjutant general, had a long confer
ence with Secretary Root to-day.
Colonel Kennon so impressed President
McKinley with the information he
brought from Havana that the Presi
dent thought it advisable he should talk
with Secretary Root. Colonel Kennon
assured both the President and the
Secretary that the course which Gen
eral Brooke was pursuing met with
general approval and was of that care
ful and conservative nature required by
the conditions in the island. It was
necessary to make radical changes, but
the policy of the general has been to
make the old fit the new with as little
friction as possible.
As to elections in Cuba, Colonel Ken
non told the Secretary that he thought
the time was still somewhat distant
when they could be held to advantage.
By a provision in the peace treaty the
Spanish residents in the island were
given one year from the day of ex
change of ratifications in which to de
clare their preference as to citizenship.
Elections could not be held, he said,
until after the year elapsed, in justice
to this class. The desirability of leav
ing the matter open was apparent, said
Colonel Kennon, because a large pro
portion of the property was owned by
Spanish subjects. Colonel Kennon said
that the people of Cuba were fast com
ing to the conclusion that the interests
of all would be best subserved by the
people accepting Cuban citizenship and
by Cubans and Spaniards acting in
harmony, and while the I*'1 *' do not mix
well at present, the feeling of irritation
is wearing away. The matter of suf
frage is one, the colonel said, that must
be carefully considered. The disad
vantages which a great portion of the
people have been under and which have
prevented them from being educated
will make it extremely hazardous to
grant universal suffrage when the time
comes for holding an election. Secre
tary Root was very much gratified with
the information which Colonel Kennon
conveyed. The Secretary has been re
ceiving a great mass of documents and
data upon Cuba and Porto Rico. Some
of the alleged facts are diametrically
opposed to each other, and the Secre
tary is now trying to reconcile the dif
ferences and sift the truth.

DR. ABORN
Permanent Cares Often Ef-
fected at the First
Treatment.
Dr. Aborn was one of the first phy-
sicians on the American continent, over
thirty years ago, to recognize catarrh of
the head as a disease that was prone tr>
terminate in throat, bronchial and lung
affections, and unless properly treated and
checked, ended in that dread disease, con-
sumption and consequent death.
Dr. Aborn also was one of the first
physicians in America to make the treat-
ment of diseases of the eye, ear, head,
throat, lungs and digestive organs a
specialty, and his wonderful cures to-day
[ are well known on the Pacific Coast as
well as throughout the I'nion.
Dr. Aborn published an articlo thirty
years ago entitled:
"Specialties in Medicine are Demanded
for the Highest Good of Suffering
Humanity."
Since that time his methods as outlined
in this article have been approved and
adopted by the medical profession, so
that to-day the legitimate specialist is
fully recognized, anil to whom the general
practitioner refers all such cases as resist
ordinary modes of practice and require
special treatment.
Mr. T. Sullivan, a well-known shoe
manufacturer at 9 Ot-ary street, who was
cured in two weeks' time of a disease of
the eye. after he had undergone treat-
ment for nine years elsewhere without
success, is one of the many conspicuous
instances of Dr. Aborn's wonderful skill
and success. Within the past few weeks
this skill has been exercised in many
ways. One noteworthy rase is that of a
clerk in an insurance office in this city
who was blind in one eye for eight years
with a cataract. After a month's treat-
ment by Dr. Aborn he is enabled to dis-
tinguish objects for the first time since
his affliction began. In a few weeks more
it is believed his sight will have been
completely restored.
Dr. Aborn certainly possesses wonderful
and almost magical power which insures
success in nearly every case undertaken
by him. One of his patients recently
gained twenty-four pounds In three
weeks' time. Another was cured of an
j ulcerated eye in two days.
Dr. Aborn's medicated inhalations, local
I and constitutional treatments, almost in-
variably give instant relief in catarrh of
the head, asthma and all throat, bron-
chial and lung affections. His treatment
builds up and revitalizes the constitu-
tion, and fortifif-s the system against
CQlda and catarrhal affections, thereby
averting the tendency or predisposition
to .consumption and prolonging life. His
patients often gain from ten to thirty
pounds in thirty to sixty days.
Instantaneous and permanent cures are
' often effected at the first treatment of
diseases of the eye aa well as deafness
; and all ear diseases. 1 >r. Aborn gives free
consultation at his office and residence at
. 554 S'ltter street. Hours 10 tql2 and 2to 4

TEST OF SPEED
Columbia Once More
the Victor.
OUTSAILS THE DEFENDER
HER SUPERIORITY NOW FULLY
DEMONSTRATED.
Both Yachts Cross the Starting Line
Together, and the New Vessel
Wins by Nearly Nine
Minutes.
gpf^lal Dispatch to The Call.
NEWPORT, R. 1.. Aug. Under
the clearest of skies and in as fine a
topsail breeze as one could desire, the
Columbia put the finishing touches to
her series of trial races against the De
fender in the presence of the New York
Yacht Club fleet to-day, winning the
twenty-one mile race by 8 minutes and
f.2 seconds^ The fickleness of the breeze
caused disappointment, and the contest,
which looked at the start as If it was
Koing to be a splendid one. developed
into a lazy drifting match.
The race was given by the New York
Yacht Club as a wind-up of the annual
cruise, as far as racing is concerned,
and cups, which were designated as
"wind-up cups," were offered as prizes
for the competing yachts. In addition
to the races between the schooners' and
sloops, all the thirty-footers in these
waters had a little match of their own,
the trophy being a handsome silver gup
offered by Commodore J. Pierpont Mor
gan of the New York Yacht Club. Then
there was considerable interest In the
schooner class, in which the Amorita
and the Quizetta compel
Of course the Columbia won from the
Defender, and it appears that the peo
ple down this way are getting rather
tired of seeing these big single stickers
race, for the licet that witnessed the
contest was ik-i nearly us large as yes
terday.
The Amorita won easily from her
rival, the Quizetta. In the thirty-footer
class the Carolina won by skillful hand
ling. -
The start madti by the Columbia
and the Defender has never been
equaled by such large boats in
any race. A bare' two seconds
separated them when they tore
over the line, carrying clouds of. canvas
aioft, and they were only twenty-seven
seconds later than gunfire in crossing.
Ten minutes before the time to start
both skippers began jockeying for the
better position, and Charlie Barr proved
once more what a great head he has by
placing the Columbia Just to weather of
the Defender, less than fifty feet away.
It is no discredit- to Captain"Rhodes,
however, that he was under, the new
boat's lee, for one of the two had to be
there In such a start as to-day's and it
fell to him to be the unlucky one. Time
was getting short when Barr jibed the
Columbia's mainsail to starboard and
swung around for' the line. The De
fender was already steering that way,
and down they both came for it, break
ing out jib topsails and hoisting balloon
stays as they did so." â¢ â  â¢ .
For a few seconds they held along on
even "terms, but the Columbia, having
the weather berth, cut off the De
fender's wind just enough to
check her a little, and as they
both crossed a quarter of the Colum
bia's hull was she-wing by the De
fender's bow. A moment later the De
fender was astern arid the Columbia
heading for the flag mark off Point Ju
dith with a lead of a good length. From
there on it was simply a steady gain
for the new boat, .when the wind died
out almost entirely after she rounded
the second mark and was coming for
home under spinnaker and balloon jib.
The Defender seemed to hold the breeze
after she rounded, closing up the long
gap a bit, but it was only for a few
minutes. Then she got into the soft
spot, and under equal conditions the
Columbia drifted away from her fast.
The Columbia won by 8 minutes and 52
second. Summary:
Columbia started ll:SS:t5; finished 3:29:00;
elapsed time, S:SS:SS.
Defender started 11:3',2T; finished 3:37:54

Mr. J. R. Miller, Healdsburgâ Dear Sir:
I will not be able to be present at the j
meeting of the grape growers to be held
in Healdsburg to-morrow. I do not Be* ;
j how my presence is necessary, as my
I proposition is perfectly plain, and, as I j
; have stated in a number of communica- 1
tions, I am not in the field to further it
by personal effort, f believe that if the-j
crop of the State could be controlled I can j
establish and keep up the value of the |
product to $14 per ton. Anyway, I think |
ir is worth trying, for If I succeed, taking !
into consideration the increased value
which will be given to the land by reason
I of the control, the number of millions
I that will be added to the wealth of the 1
State will bL 1 hard to estimate. Yours !
very truly, HENRY J. CROCKER.
The meeting was addressed by J. R. j
' Miller of the firm of Miller & Hotch
j kiss; C. A. Reiners, a winemaker of Dry
(Creek Valley; John Markley of Geyser
: ville, Mr. Greeley of Windsor, George i
' Templeman, H. C. Hodges and others, j
All spoke strongly in favor of accepting j
; Mr. Crocker's offer. Before the meet
ing closed the following committees
were appointed to circulate the con
tracts in the districts named and ob
tain signers:

The Call correspondent has made a
; careful canvass of the situation among
! the growers in this section and finds
i that they arc almost unanimously in
i favor of aeoppting the offer made by
Mr Crocker. The only point on which
many are holding back is the belief
that tho contract is not as binding on
Mr. Crocker as it is on the growers.
Once convinced they can hold Mr.
Crocker to his agreement all opposi
tion will be swept away.

' : - .;... Epeciai Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 13.â President E.
P. Ripley and the party of subordinate
officials of the Santa Fe Railway System
who are traveling with him, arrived from
San Diego last evening. They will be In
Los Angeles until Thursday and may not
leave until one day later. In the course
of an interview, Mr. Ripley said:
"The business prospects throughout tho
country were never In better condition,
than they are at present, and there is no
reason why' existing conditions should not
continue indefinitely.
"The Santa Ke will be running train 3
between Los Angeles and San Francisco
by January 1, 1900, and probably before
that. As to the character of train service
; which will be placed in commission, I can
not yet say. Those details have not yet
been arranged and cannot be for some
j little time. ->-.. 'â .'- -â *Â
"I shall make a thorough inspection of
the San Joaquin Valley line before return
ing East, and when that trip is over, wilt
be able to say just when our trains will
be running in and out of San Francisco.
"The Santa Ft- Pacific has been almost
entirely rebuilt in recent years. We have
expended in round figures, a sum in the
neighborhood of $3,000,000 in betterments
between Albuquerque and Mojave since
1596.
"The travel to Los Angeles from the
East continues to grow, and as a result
the Santa Fe will, beginning this fall, be
compelled to run two transcontinental
trains each way every day. I have no
idea at this time that the Santa Fe
limited will run through between Chicago
i and San Francisco when our line gets. into
! the last-named city. For the present, at
j least, the train will continue to run only
to Los Angeles.
"So far as the contemplated removal or
our Pacific Coast headquarters from Los
Angeles to San Francisco is concerned,
you may say no such step is contem
plated, and will not be attempted at any
time in the near future.
"As soon as we are running in and out
of San Francisco we shall consolidate all
of the lines in California under one man
agement, as contemplated under the act
of the last Legislature. The California
lines may, however, be operated under a
single management before that time."
CONTROVERSY INVOLVES
SAN RAFAEL SCHOOLS
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 15.â What threat
ens to develop into the most heated con
troversy that ever agitated local school
circles had its inception last Sunday
morning at a conference between Attor
i ney Henry Eickhoff and Henry Schlosser.
composing the finance committee of the
Board of Town Trustees, and four mem
bers of the City Board of Education. At
that conference, held in the new High
School building, it was alleged by Princi
pal Bentley that Attorney Eickhoff caus
ed the High School appropriation for the.
next fiscal year to be reduced from JS4SS
to $7000, "because of venom and anger, re
sulting from his two boys being discip
lined." It was further charged that At-
I torney Eickkoff seconded Huntlngton's
! famous statement that $1000 should not
I be expended in the education of a ten-cent
child, when referring to the fact that at
an i expense of $6500 only ten pupils had
been graduated from the high school last
year.
Attorney Eickhoff explains clearly that
his remarks were distorted and says he
took his children from the school for good
i reasons. He is supported by an influential
i member of the board.
! Attorney Eickhoff admits his belief that
certain persons "have gone education
mad," and says the extravagance of the
i old School Board has caused all the
i trouble.

..The death. of Joseph J. Im.sand. the hog
ranc.nef,:-who was mur iered In Colma early
Monday. morning, ha ->. been â  avenged. The
feud Voxisting between the Mitchells and
the-Imsands, productive of so much tur
moil'and.'desperate deeds, has passed over
the bounds of fan . warring and has te
come i: country town affair. In the dead
of darkless very early yesterday morning
a ..band -.of infuiiated ranchers and farm
er's m the hdig iborhood of Colma set tire
to : the liiii.ii: on Mitchell's land and
razed them tc the ground.
: he three Ni.itcheiÂ»Â«i â William, David and
William Jr. are now Incarcerated in the
Colma Jail under suspicion of the murder
of Joseph imsand. T.he brutality ol the
crime, th< oft-repeated threats of the
negroes and past transgressions on their
part uroased the small population of
Colma to a state of frenzy on Monday
night a. id everything pointed to a violent
outcome. Throughout the entire Colma
ranching section there is but one family
of colored people, the Mitchells. All the
others are of various rationalities and
have come together from lime to time In
a social way. The Mitchells were ex
cluded from these gatherings, being left
to themselves. William Mitchell, the
head of the house, is a man of the most
pugnacious temperament, and he antag
onized every other rancher in the district.
A cloud or mystery hangs over the burn-
Ing or Mitchell's home and outhouses.
Shortly after 12 o'clock yesterday morn-
Ing a blaze was noticed in the direction
of Mitchell's house by Constable Neville,
who was standing In" front of the Coima
White House, a half-mile away. Tue
heavens were soon lighted by the tire
and before the Constable could reach the
scene the tinderllke buildings of Mitchell
were in ashes. No one in Colma will
speak of the conflagration or divulge the
names of the Incendiaries, yet it is roin
monly said there were some thirty or
forty men who participated in the mid
night rush upon Mitchell's land.
Frequent threats were made in Colma
Monday aftc-rnnon by the enraged ranch
ers. Imsand was a very popular member
of the Swiss colony about that town, and
his murder was considered a blow to all.
The incendiaries moved in a body up th*
creek, and when they reached Mitchell
house they took every precaution to pre
vent the tire from spreading. Emsand's
widow and children live in a small white
house adjacent, and this was protected
from possible conflagration before the
colored man's property was fired. When
"'onsrablH Neville arrived upon the scene
r.o one was In sight, and save for the
crackling embers there was an utter ab
prnce "->f noise. Mitchell's chickens, ducks
ana hogs had been driven out of their
pens and there wa? a general scattering
of fowl and pork over the four ends of
the county.
Sheriff Mansfield arrived In Colma dur
ing the afternoon, and In conjunction with
1 >table Neville held an investigation of
the aftermath of the murder. Arrests may
be made at any moment, but a general
secrecy and reticence Involve the entire
rt ff a ! r.
The loss suffered by Mitchell Is variously
estimated; $1500 being set as a low ilgure.
53000 as the maximum limit.

THE CITY MAY BE
LEFT IN DARKNESS
CROCKETT THREATENS TO TURN
OUT THE LIGHT.
Attempts to Bluff the Supervisors
Into Awarding Him the Light
ing Contract.
Mr. J. B. Crockett, president of the gas
company, has delivered his ultimatum to
the Board of Supervisors; either he will
be awarded the contract for the city's
lighting for the next year to come or he
will shut off the city's flow of gas and
leave things In awful darkness until such
time as the company that dues get the
job gets to operating and attaches its
mains to the street lamps and public
buildings.
Mr. Crockett, with the assistance of
Attorney Rix.. threatened this dire thing
yesterday afternoon when the Street
Lighting Committee of the board was
considering the Dew lighting specifica
tions. Not one of the committee dreamed
that Mr. Crockett's visit was one of black
portent. They had all gathered to hear
Mayor Phelan expatiate upon art In street
lamps and the esthetic in ornamental
iron roles.
The new specifications provide for fifty
of the newest thing In electric light
shafts, to be distributed along Market
street between the ferry and Valencia
street junction, and twenty-three more to
adorn Van Ness avenue from Market to
Vallejo. The question was whether the
poles should have a twisted or plain iron
base, when Mr. Crockett tossed out his
bombshell. It developed later that it did
not explode for the reason that it was the
same old bomb that Mr. Crocket! waves
aloft whenever his bills are a month be
hind or the tax levy not big enough lor
his company's demands.
While the specifications were being read
over Mayor Phelan took exception to that
clause which provided that the successful
bidder should comply with his contract
within ten days after It had been award
ed. He said it would shut out all other
companies than the combine, which might
care to bid and yet not be as well pre
pared. He said that. Mr. Summerhayes
of the Mutual Company was present and
that be would bid. but required more than
the ten days allowed In which to fulfill
his contract should it be awarded to him.
Reference to the statutes developed the
fact that the law fixes the time at six
months, so that question was settled
without further discussion.
The ornamental pole which the speci
fications provided for Mr. Crockett said
would cost from $50 to $73. and he would
not care to bid on them. Mayor Phelan
explained that there were only seventy
three such poles provided for and that It
was the intention that they should re
vert to the city at the end of the con
tract, and that the city of a consequence
would have to pay for them.
The high-priced pole was finally de
cided upon and the contract clause allow
ed to stand as fixed In the statutes; at
six -norths: and with these two changes
the specifications will be 'submitted for
bids.

had but litr'.' 1 to Bay concerning the" plans
of the delegation while here. Everything
depends on the wishes of the men return
ing. Nothing will be attempted until the
regiment is consulted, and when its wishes
are known every possible effort will be
made to comply with them. Upon return
ing home each company will- be royally
entertained by the town that t.t was or
ganized in. and the State at large will
present every man who enlisted with a
medal of honor and a certificate setting
forth the appreciation which is felt for
the valor and patriotism of the men who,
forsaking everything, grasped the' rifle
and stood ready to defend their country's
honor with thfir lives. The State will also
pay the troops' transportation.

SMUGGLING BOAT CONDEMNED.
Steam Launch Erminie Will Be Sold
by United States Marshal.
On motion of Assistant United States
Attorney Banning yesterday in the L'nlted
oiities l'isiri' I v null, juu^t 1 ue nuvfii
rendered a default judgment in the mat
ter of the seizure of the steam launch Er
inlnkV in Humboldt Bay by the Federal
authorities two weeks ago. Mr. Banning
asked also for sin order of condemnation
and sale, no one having appeared to
claim her. The launch will be Bold in
front of the courthouse in Eureka on a
date to be fixed by the court.
The Erminie sailed from San Francisco
two weeks ago without having been reg
istered and Inspected, as required by the
Federal law, and committed another of
fense against maritime regulations by be

namely Albert Cooper and W. F. Good

opinion that the launch was destined tor

Choked Sewers in Richmond.
The attention of the Point Lohos Im
provement Club was directed to the
j choked condition of numerous sewers ih
I that locality by the report of the execu
i tlve committee of the club. Notably the
â¢ recutive committee drew attention to the
filthy condition of the neighborhood at
â¢ lenient street and Thirtieth avenue
Here the drainage and refuse from the
> entire section is forced to ooze to the sur
! face by reason of no connecting sewer
! through which it can run into the main
I outlet. The attention of the Board of
Health has been repeatedly called to this
1 nuisance, but so far. further than a verbal
j condemnation of its condition, nothing
I has been accomplished.
Then came complaints from A street
; between Seventh and Eighth avenues'
where the Park Primary School building
iis located. The attention of Contractors
, Flinn & Tracy has been directed to their
I neglect in not making the necessary con
, nections with the leading sewer, thus en
dangering the health of the pupils attend
ing this school.
In order that immediate steps may be
taken in correcting the grievances com-
I plained of a committee consisting of j
I T. Williams. James H. Dever and P M
; McGushin was appointed to take proper
| action in the premises and force the con
i tractors and property owners to remedy
; the evils.

CALLING TIME
FOR THE LOCAL
CONVENTIONS
Republicans to Confer
To-Morrow.
THE DELEGATIONS ORGANIZE
DEMOCRATIC SENTIMENT FA
VORS EARLY NOMINATIONS.
Gavin McNab Has Resclved to Ex
clude Rainey-Examiner Follow
ers From the New County-
Committee.
The Republican . Committee, A.
J. Raisch chairman, will meet to-morrow
evening to designate a time for holding j
the local nominating convention of the j
party. Yesterday Mr, Raisch said that !
the committee would'-. no doubt be gov
erned largely by. the wishes of the leaders
of the Central Republican League. He
believed that the County . Committee
would call an early convention if the
organization, of which Henry T. Scott is
president, so desired. Everything possible
will be done by the County Committee to
promote the unity and strength of the
party in the municipal campaign.
The district committee and the chair
men of the respective district delegations j
acknowledging allegiance to the Central
Republican League will meet at -head- |
quarters in the Grand Hotel, to-morrow'
evening to .discuss the time and place of ,
holding the convention. â¢â¢. '.Â»â  .
The meeting promises to be well at
tended, as the various district delega- j
tions have organized and each, delegation
will have a representative at the confer
ence to-morrow evening: It is thought \
that the nominating convention will as
semble some time about the middle of i
S.-pt.-tnber. â¢ .
Jasper McDonald, chairman of the ;
Democratic Committee of One Hundred. 1
will call his county committee together at
an early date. He Returned from the ,
country yesterday reinvigorated. Both j
of the L>emocratlc leaders of the Commit- i
tee of One Hundred have had their sum- |
mer outing and are in trim to give their
energies to the campaign. There is a |
Democratic sentiment favorable to an j
e:irly convention, but the nominations
may not be made until the new county
committee is chosen. In order to check- ]
mate the Examiner, Mr. McNab will at i
the first opportunity obtain full and I
complete control of the governing body
of the local Democracy. He may en- \
counter resistance from stiff-necked dele
gations, but as he understands the busi
ness of dealing' with recalcitrant Demo-:
< rats, there is little doubt of his ability j
to bring the kickers Into line. Mr. Me-
Nab will make it a Bpecial point to ex
clude from the county committee the late j
supporters of the Rainey-Examiner ;
league, to the end that the Hearst in- |
lluence In the California delegation to the i
next national Democratic convention shall !
be too slight for calculation.

A DAY OF THANKSGIVING AND JOY.
GOVERNOR WELLS of Utah has issued a I
proclamation setting apart Saturday, August |
19. as a legal holiday in that State "for the !
purpose of general thanksgiving and rejoicing," and
advises and requests that "all places 01 business be
closed nn that day. and that all the people of the State
in welcoming home the brave men who have
it so valiantly and endured so well" in the
Philippine campaign.
The example thus given is one that should be foi
lowed in California. The great mass of the people
desire such a holiday in order that working men and
women may have an opportunity to join in the glad
festival with which our returning volunteers will be ;
gr( eted.
The demand lor a public Voliday is so widespread
as to be almost universal. It is to be regretted it is
not completely so, but in al! communities there an
men who arc adverse to the public, who scoff at popu
lar enthusiasms and mock at loyalty. There are a few
nun in California, and here and there they are
objecting to the popular will, opposing a holiday ani ,
denouncing those who advocate it.
( >ne of these fault-finders is the Sacramento Bee.
It has no reason for its course, so by way of justify
ing its opposition it says: "San Francisco wants this
b:y solely for her own selfish ends. If the
J-1 r -- 1 California Regiment were to disembark at 1
Eureka 1 j at San Diego not a whisper would be
i from San Francisco about a State holiday to
commemorate it. In fact, every metropolitan paper
would vigorously denounce such a suggestion."
A falser statement than that would be difficult to
invent. What selfish purpose has San Francisco to
serve in a holiday of rejoicing over the return of the
California Volunteers? What selfishness can there
be in the loyalty and the patriotism that prompt a
people to do honor to the men who have upheld the
cause of their country in war?
The people of San Francisco will raise $50,000 to
provide for the reception and entertainment of the
volunteers when they arrive. Is that selfish? In ad
dition to the sum contributed to be used by the re
ception committee the citizens of San Francisco will
expend in the decoration of their stores, offices and
private bouses fully as much more. Is that selfish?
San Francisco at her own cost will provide a genuine
California welcome for the returning heroes and in
vites the people of every part of the State to come
and join in the fc-tival. Is that selfish? San Fran
cisco desires that not the rich only but the working
classes of the State have the full freedom of a legai
holiday to share in the welcome. Is that selfish?
The Bee is evidently suffering from some sort of
concussion of the head which prevents it from think
ing straight, and for the time being does not know
the difference between its mission as a honey gath
erer and that of a kissing bug.
Two Kentucky Democratic orators were recently
me. in the midst of addresses, by intense heat.
It generally takes something of that sort to stop a
Democratic orator, but Kcntuckians are not going to
take any chances. William Jennings Bryan has been
threatened that he will be shot if he enters the State.
His Highness the Sultan of the Sutu Islands has
sent his kindest regard- to Washington and wants to
know if the Americans will be his brothers. Here is
an exceptional opportunity for Uncle Sam to acquire
;i harem of sisters-in-law, as his Highness is bounti
full) supplied with wives.
( 'aklnnders have been thrown into spasms of in
tion at the assertion that their City Hall is a
rookery. They should hot unnecessarily alarm them-
The accusation that the City Hall . was a
"crookery" has passed at times without a murmur.
J
Richard Croker says it would be a travesty on popu
lar suffrage to name the Democratic candidate for
President before the nominating convention meets.
It would be worse than a travesty for Croker to name
the unfortunate after the convention assembles.

DISREGARD OF LAW.
SERIOUSLY, if Ml American were isolated in
another country and looking in perspective
upon his native land he would be hard pressed
for explanations that would make the current events
among us consistent with our claim of a high civili
sation.
Whether the country is responding. in its own way
to GoVernor Roosevelt's call to a â¢'more strenuous
life," or whether the passions always let loose by war
are at large, or whatever may be the reason, the past
year has been characterized by a disregard for law
and its orderly administration to an extent heretofore
unknown in our history. To say nothing of the wage
troubles, in which dynamite and missiles, the torch
and rifle have been appealed to in more than * score
of cases, the issue being between employer and em-
ployed, there is the infliction of the death penalty by j
mobs, the issue being between one or a few mdi- i
vutaals, known or Mispccted to have violated the law,
and scores and hundreds of citizens who violate the ;
law to punish its violation.
There have been in the United States within the
year one hundred lynchings. The most of them have
occurred in the South, and negroes have been the i
victim,-. In the majority of cases the exciting c^u-e i
has been the commission of an unspeakable crime,
but in a percentage of them there was no proof that
the victim was guilty. The sad truth seems to be |
that the relations between whites and blacks in the j
South have become so strained that the tires of a de- '
vastating race war arc smoldering in more than half
of those States. The whites are falling into the habit
of considering it their duty to kill a negro when one ,
of that race commits a crime, and one is killed with
out any nicety of discrimination as to his identity.
The mob habit being abroad, others than negro?-;
are its victims. Within a month fifty missionaries of
the Mormon church have been mobbed in Georgia.
Tennessee and Kentucky. Their churches have been
burned or torn clown, and every right of free speech j
and religious toleration has been denied to them.
Any one who knows the effect of persecution upon a
religious sect knows that these things will do more
to propagate Mormonism than preaching can do.
Therefore all who believe that sect to be pernicious j
must be appalled when ignorant and mistaken men
put behind it the impetus of martyrdom. Mormonism
never became formidable until after Joseph Snjith was
shot by an Illinois mob in Carthage jail and his [ol
lowers were banished from Nauvoo. When let alone j
in their temple they were harmless, but when Illinois {
politicians began to court their vote and get mad
when it went to the other party religious persecution
began and the future of Mormonism was assured The
church is now rich and already announces that it will
spend a million, if need be, to protect its missions
and its missionaries As a corporation it has just
issued $500,000 in church bonds, all of which were
taken by rich Mormons in Utah. Therefore no one |
need be troubled about the effect on that strong
theocracy, which can take care of itself. The solici
tude of an impartial American runs to his country.
We protect missionaries abroad, among the
heathen, and we mob missionaries at home, becau c
their brand of Christianity does not suit us. The race
war has more serious features than the religious war. ;
General Stephen D. Lee, a very influential member
of the Confederate Veterans, advises that the South
proceed to exterminate the negroes, and it is appall
ing that this proposition is regarded as reasonable, ,
proper and feasible, even iiK border State.- like Vir
ginia. Throughout the South if a citi/cn or a news
paper deprecate the lynching of a negro instantly
comes back the accusation from the lynchers of sym
pathy with the crime committed by the victim. Rear
son there i< not on that subject. We have no doubt!
that an attempt at universal massacre Us impending.

At a recent meeting-'.orthe-StM* -Agricultural 1 So

by the whites of the forcible exiling of about â¢\ten. : nnK.j
lions of blacks. Hon. Hoke Smith was present and
seems to have 'made the approval of the address!
unanimous. The issue in this form, is .serious. It is j
j just as much a violation of the constitutional rights of ]
a negro to forcibly exile him as to kill him. But the , :
feud seems to be irreconcilable. .Their deportation i
j into Northern States would demoralize the labor mar,
j ket in both sections, unless there were an immediate
exchange of places between them and an equal num
ber of Northern white workmen, who would go
: South. Against this stands the lower wage scale in
I the South in the labor field now occupied by the
negroes. At present this most distressing issue, gen- \
crated in a slowly accumulated passion that cannot be '
reasoned with, is the great American problem.

TO DEFEAT MR. BRYAN.
WITH a" vigor that is surprising, considering
the heat of the dog days in the East, the
Democratic politicians of that section are
working up scheme after scheme to deprive Bryan of
his leadership of the party and to defeat bis expecta
tions of a renomination next year.
The attempt of Tammany to start a boom for Van
Wyck failed at the famous Jefferson banquet. The
dollar dinner of the Bryanites eclipsed the Tammany
feast and, despite the luxury of champagne and or
tolans, made it look like thirty cents at a Democratic
primary. The effort made on the Fourth of July was
even more futile, for on that glorious day, in Tam
many Hall itself, Mr. Hogg of Texas rooted the
thing up by the roots and left not a sprout behind.
Later plans laid to bring Gorman to the front
with all the South behind him have failed as com
pletely as those laid with so much care in the in
THE SA]^ FIIANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 16, 1899.
terests of the Brooklyn man. Some strong papers in
the South have advocated Gorman and some able
politicians in the North have openly declared for him,
but the masses North and South have continued to
slfout for Bryan with the persistency of parrots that
have but one cry.
Repeated failures following one another so rap
idly would dishearten most men, to the extent at
least of inclining them to give up and take a rest
during the summer, but Tammany is tireless. A new
plan has been devised and is now being worked up
at Saratoga, where a considerable number of Demo
cratic leaders from all parts of the country are gath
ered. By this plan it is proposed to bring forward
favorite sons from as many States as have such
precious and popular possessions and present them all
at the next convention in opposition to the Nebraska
favorite.
If the scheme can be carried out, a good many
delegations that otherwise might be instructed for
Bryan will be sent to the national convention to sup
port local favorites. New York will be pledged to
Van Wyck; Pennsylvania to Pattison: Illinois to
Harmon; Ohio to Campbell; Maryland to Gorman;
Massachusetts to Olney; Missouri to Stone; and it
is believed other States can be found where Demo
crats have sufficient pride in a local favorite to in
struct a delegation for him.
Th ; object of the plan of course is to prevent
Bryan from carrying the convention with a rush. By
dividing tht vote among many candidates the con
test will be prolonged until confusion will result, and
then the astute politicians who are working against
the free silver champion will be able to make com
binations that will defeat him in the end.
From reports made by Southerners at Saratoga it
appears there is a widespread discontent in that sec
tion with the Bryan leadership. In the South the
Democratic party is the conservative party, and the
better elements of it are naturally antagonistic to the
vagaries of Populism, of which Bryan is the repre
sentative. They do not like the work of fighting
Populists in their State politics and then supporting
what are virtually a Populist platform and a Populist
candidate in national politics. Tammany will thus
have considerable support from the delegations of that
section in making combinations against Bryan if it
have an opportunity to do so in the convention.
Hence the scheme of putting up the favorite sons.
The report of the Samoan Commission has reached
Washington, but Secretary of State Hay says he will
net permit the details to be made public until after
the document has been inspected by the officials.
When The Call published the complete report two
weeks ago it had no desire to make the worthy Secre
tary of State act like the ostrich with his head in the
sand.
Scientists attribute the recent seismic disturbances
in all parts of the globe to the fact that the earth has
been on an uneven keel. The fact that Tom Reed has
crossed over to this side from Europe will tend to
rearrange the equilibrium. Let the procession of the
equinoxes proceed!
BY the assault upon M. Labori another black
mystery has been added to the number that sur
round the Dreyfus case. The assault was a.* I
cowardly as it was murderous, and was committed
under circumstances that justify the conclusion it was
the result of a conspiracy, and not the outcome of the
rage of some irresponsible and frantic anti-Semite.
Had the act been committed by some wretched ras
cal like Guiteau the blow would have been struck in
the open, as was that which killed Gartield, or that
which but a short time ago struck down the Empress j
nf Austria. The scoundrel would have been insane
enough to glory in the act and would have accom- j
panied it with something of bravado and bloodthirsty
display-. V ...
The/me.n who assaulted Labori acted like ordinary
nnirdernii.s criminals*, .cp-mmitting; or. attempting to
Vunvntit murder for money/ . He was cunningly way
:lsi<T "arid; all arrangements '".ft>F flight/ami escape pre â¢

and \yho;in.he- never. Saw. Moreover, after Labori. had i
â¢fallen and: 'his assailants had fled,, certain other per : I
.sqris;:'e.Â£Klenliy. acting in concert with the assassins, i
â¢snaifcehed tip ; the .papers/; of .the lawyer arid mayde off
with -om'e .of.the'.mpre important of them.
: The wofhl will not willingly hold tire higher officers
of.the'.ariiTy of- France, responsibly for such cowardly
crime .as .this:.. ..Desptte the. silly assertions of such
.writers., as Nordaii.; the French are not a degenerate
people any more than those of other civilized coun
triesV, Civilisation.- has . indeed bred many new forms
6f stoundrelisrn in France, but ithasbred just about
a,s marry : elsewhere, and. if /this Dreyfas case,, with its
revelations,.. has .brought to light in the French arniy. a
self-confessed forger like ; Colonel Henry, it has also
mndekhtnvn the existence oi Colonel Picquart, a man;
of the highest type b.f honor .known, to human ideals,.
,'â  If. however, the. generals and other high officers ifi-r
to'l yed ' iti the scandal be not guilty, who. can be guilty?
Though a. thousand explanations have been attempted
of the whole mystery, no satisfactory solution has yet
been put forward. The Esterhazy confessions may be
true, but who can believe a man who confesses to so
many forms of scoundrelism? The officers of the gen
eral staff may have been on the verge of exposure in
; the crime of selling secrets for coin to pay their debts;
' and for concealment may have conspired to make
; Dreyfus a scapegoat, but if that be true why should
j so many cabinet officers and other officials having no
connection with the army be equally eager with them j
10 convict the accused man?
It is believed to be the desire of the present Minis
try and of President Loubet to have Dreyfus acquitted ,
of the charge of writing the famous bordereau, re- '
stored to his rank and the scandal closed. There was
at one time a fair prospect of such a termination of
the case. The assault upon Labori changes the whole
situation. Whether guilty or not, the army, and the I
higher officers of it especially, will be under suspicion ,
of prompting the crime unless the criminals bo
promptly caught and another motive for their action I
be clearly shown.
As the situation stands France must be on the
verge of civil disturbance if not revolution despite the i
firmness of Loubet and the courage of General Gal- !
lifet. If Dreyfus be convicted now it would seem j
nothing can prevent an outbreak. The chain of for- !
gerics. suicides, murders and assassinations which link
the successive steps of the case has become at last un
endurable.
A co-operative banking system is to be made an
experiment at Stockton. The announcement is made
tliEt a Jx)frower may pay off his loan at any time. If
the word "can" had been used instead of "may" the i
institution would suffer from no lack oKsnbscribers.
The dispatcher, make the alarming announcement
that a whale with a stomach incurably affected is .1 j
mine richer than gold. There are epicures without i
number, in New York, for example, who might for
the benefit of their heirs change places with the whale.

COUNTING IN (RIBBAGEâ C. R. 3.,
Oakland, Cal. The rule in crlbbage in
counting: whyre there Is a double royal
pair is as follows:
Four cards of a sort make the combination
known as double royal pair. fi>r which the
score is twelve; alike whether made in play,
in the hand, or in the crib. The turn up < urd
recki ns with hand and crib, in this as In every
other case. Moreover, should your opponent
have made a pair royal, by playing a third of
.1 BOrt, you are entitled to the double pair royal
if you answer him with a fourth. In takina
twelve tcr a double pair royal, you are not to
suppose that the twelve are merely increase
numbers, bt stowed aa premiums f<>r such eom
binationa ol the cards, and settled by arbi
trary arrangement, independent of the rule
that two points are aIIOWeS fur every pair. A
pair reckons for two, and the same principle
! to a pair r0.,al produces six; because
as a pair royal contains three distinct pairs,
you score two for- each pair.

CONSPIRATORS
ARE ALL NOW
AT LIBERTY
" Brick" McPherson
Will Not Answer.
AFRAID OFTHE CONSEQUENCES
HOPING TO DISCOVER WHO
DAVIS IS.
Judge Treadwell Wants the Grand
Jury to Takfr the Matter Up
and Probe It to the
Bottom.
Judge Treadwell has finally thrown up
the sponge in his attempt to unravel the
"Brick" McPherson conspiracy and n ill
allow some Interested party to take the
matter before the Grand Jury, where it
can be thoroughly investigated.
The case of Thomas J. Clisham, charged
with obtaining money from Attorney I.
N. Thorne. was before the Judge again
yesterday afternoon. The chief conspira
tor, "Brick," was put on the stand and
he refused to answer several Â«iuestions put
, to him on the ground that it would tend
,to incriminate him. Prosecuting Attorney
'. Carpenter wanted the witness punish.d
I for contempt, but the Judge decided that
1 the witness was legally righi in refuting
: to answer the questions on the ground
alleged.
The prosecution said there were no oth< r
! witnesses to be examined, and Attorni y
Mack, for the defendant, at bnce moved
for a dismissal, as nothing had been ad
duced to support the charge.
The Judge said he would have to dis
miss the case for the reason that th â¢ wit
nesses had failed to testify as they should
! have done. It was deplorable that men
'â  could conspire to swindle innocent people
] out of their money and not be punished
for it. Mrs. Carrol] had been swindled,
and her attorney had given his excuse
that he had done the business for her OS
I an attorney, but he had no hesitation In
' fharacterizing it as a mean, contemptible
; piece of business. He hoped the Grand
i Jury would take the matter up and probe
; it to the bottom.
i "1 shall dismiss the case cgainsi Clls
â â  ham," continued the Judge, "and also the
case of Smoot. Let the case of Thomas
i R. Davis, the mythical person charged
with obtaining (100,000 from A. W. Mc-
Pherson. be continued for a week, as 1
am anxious to know who he is."
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter sug
j gested that the Davis cnÂ±. be continued
I till September SO, which would give ample
time to find out ail about the mysterious
prrsonage. He also suggested * that <>>>
"Brick" had been released on a writ of
habeas corpus th" cast- against h^m
be stricken from tho calendar.
The Judge concurred in both sugges
tions, and as "Brick" was leaving thÂ»>
courtroom he called after him. "Perhnps
by Septerr'-er 20 we may be able to gf
<hat $lii"'.(Â«. for you."

1 favorable e>\es np.-n any more such side
, light propositions that may come up.
T n regard to the matter of the Valloy
; road running mi.<> Oakland, Mr. Walker
said thai it was yti far too early to speak
: on the matter as the main line itseJt" was
stili far from completion. Some time S-go
there was conslderabl< talk of the Santa
Fe people starting :- 1 n i another trans
pacific steamship line from this rity to
the Orient Mr. Walker declined to dis
cuss tlie proposition further than to sajr
that if his people tieciiled that fhey want
ed such a line they would h.iv.
President Rlpley will start either trÂ»
day ox to-morrow over the One of the
Valley road toward this city, where tee
will arrive cither Friday or Saturday. Mr.
AValk<-r will probably go as far as Bakers-
I Held to meet and make the trip with him.
. o .
Fish and Forests His Charge.
Dr. Tarlton H. Bean, director in chief
I of the forestry and fisheries exhibit c at
I the Paris Exposition, has advised , the
I California commissioners that Mr.
Thomas Hart of this city will be put on
as a honorary member of his staff to' rep
resent California in all matters pertain
ing to the forests and fish of our State.
Commissioner Runyon says that* the se
! lection of a gentleman to fill ,this im
portant position was left absolutely in
i the bands of the commissioners, and the
I recently published story in an evening
: paper to the effect that W. H. Mills was
the one who would fill the place was en
i tirely without foundation and built out
I of whole cloth.

: steadily. . The figures passed the $21,

adjourned yesterday afternoon, and the
Arlon' concert in the evening added a

. To-morrow the big benefit takes
. place- Everything is ready to ring up
. the curtain, and an audience the equal
;of which in size has never been
dreamed of before in San Francisco
.will greet the performers.
The big land parade is growing' as
rapidly as the reception fund. Nearly
every organization that has been in
vited to participate has Jumped at the
chance to do honor to the returning
soldiers, and there has been a rush to
get places In the line.
One of the most thoughtful things
done yesterday. In connection with the
returning volunteers, was the steps
taken by the citizens' executive com
mittee to secure the soldiers their old
positions when they are mustered out
Of the service. It is expected that their
former employers will give the commit
tee their hearty co-operation In this
undertaking.
The naval parade, it is calculated,
will induce at least 10,000 people to go
out on the bay to greet the soldiers.
The Harbor Commissioners, who are
arranging the ' details, have- secured
ample accommodations for all who de
sire to take the trip on the water.
The plan to decorate Market street
with palms and evergreens has proved
a much greater success than its pro
jectors, had expected. Every city that
was gisked to contribute evergreens re

in agreeing among themselves not to con
tribute more than $X*) each to the
celebration fund has caused considerable
chagrin on the pan of the finance com
mittee. At a meeting of the committee
held yesterday afiernon the following
statement was given to the press:
"It having come to the ears of the com
mittee that the various great savings
banks of this city have formed a combi
nation and agreed to give only $100 each
to the welcoming fund, we wish to ex
press our deep regret that such great
financial institutions should join against
the Interests of thp people in a patriotic
movement of this kind. It is the sincere
hope of the committee that the banks will
reconsider their action, otherwise It will
have a depressing effect on the collec
tions from other Institutions of the city."
THE BENEFIT FUND
GREATLY ENRICHED
Artistic and Financial Suc
cess of the Arion
Concert.
Two thousand dollars in round numbers
was added to the California soldiers' re
reption fund by the benefit given last
night at the Alhambra Theater under the
Etuspices of the Arion Singing Society of
New York, assisted by several kindred
organizations. This is the result of the
generous offer on the part of the music
loving Germans to help out the good
cause, and that they succeeded financially
ns well as artistically goes without say-
Ing.
The generous act on the part of the
Arion Society, which may well be termed
the greatest singing society in the world
to-day, met with a response in kind from
an audience which nearly filled the vast
auditorium. It was an informal affair
throughout. The ladies made no pre
tence to elaborate dress, though a number
of charming costumes were in evidence.
The men as a general rule were in ordi
nary attire aud came to enjoy themselves
as comfortably as they might. Those who
attended the delightful concert came be
cause of their pure love of good music
and their honor for the brave lads who
are speeding across the ocean to be wel-
eompd as only California knows how to
welcome.
As to the artistic qualities of the con
cert, it is noteworthy that of all vocal
organizations a male chorus is the most
Impressive, and if directed properly it
may even assume grandiose dimensions
always providing that it is formed of

voice Is the most magnificent medium by

are a number of well-schooled vocalists

Julius Lorenz, is a graceful and accurate
conductor. In fact, accurateness, modula
tion and fine shading are all executed
with exceeding care. There are hardily
any male choruses in existence to-day
that surpass the New York Arion and
there are not very many who can equal it
The San Francisco Harmonic, under the
direction of Herman Genss. proved a
strong organization. It was evident that
hitherto the members had not received
the proper Instruction, but this first .!]>
pearance under a new director showed
already a vast improvement, and there is
no doubt that within a few months the
Harmonic will have attained great re
sults. The material is there, and as Mr.
Genbs has shown himself a capable leader
the good result is inevitable.
One of the finest orchestras ever organ
ized for such an occasion was that of last
evening, with Herman Genss as director
and John Marquardt as concert master
They played the "Jubel Overture" by
Weber, and while the strains of the finale,
which corresponds with the air,
"America," were played, the chorus of
ov.t a hundred voices Joined In the song,
which created quite an impressive effect.
Mrs. Marquardt played a harp solo with
that artistic finish and fluency for which
she is so well known here. The balance
of the programme consisted of a tenor
solo by August Grariltza, a chorus by the
San Francisco Arion, a barytone solo by
[ John Plage.mann, â¢ a chorus by the Teu
i tonia and a selection by J. B. Francis'
mandolin club.
At the close of the performance the
I Arions were banqueted by Mayor Phelan
! at the Bohemian Club.

toin of Colonel W. P. Sullivan Jr., to place.
Major General Shatter, representing .tJ>c : .
regular army, and . Colonel Dicker.s-on; <5Â£ 1
the National Guard, in charge of-.tJi.e^aTLy
parade. The companies of the Fifth Rt-{,'l- I
ment N. G. C. will be brought to the ( i;v
at the committee's expense. The rauTQa<U
was expected to carry the soldiersj-ffe^-;
but the very best the company.- .woul<l:
agree to do was to make a half - ;ra,ts.\to.

The members of the Merchants' anil":
Manufacturers' Association of Los/.. An-:
geles are coming to the city to welcome-.,
the members of Battery D, and -asked .]
that ten of their number be placed .on the-.:
reception committee. This brought- :. up/
the subject that the San Francis, ;r.oin:p-. â¢
tion committee had not been named:. This:
will be done to-day, when each - merrib.er
of the citizens' committee will suhm-lt
names in addition to the committees"; to lie.

A telegram has been forwarded to the
Secretary of the Navy requesting him
order out the lowa and the torpedo-boat. â¢
Farragut as an escort to the Sherman â¢
when she enters the. harbor. The, com- -â 
mittee has also requested that some Goy-'
eminent vessel be placed at its disposal. -..:
The fireworks committee has awarded.'
the contract for the pyrotechnic display
to the California Fireworks Company.
Eastern firms made a bid for the work,
but the committee decided that the home
concern was entitled to it. The display.
will be the greatest ever seen in Califor
nia. No contract so large has ever been;
awarded on the coast. The display will
be confined to the line of march along
Market street, the details of which have,
been left to a sub-committee composed' of
T. T. Williams and Charles B. Stone. *=. : -
The difficulty which confronted the com
mittee in the undertaking was the-fact
that there were no means by which it.-'
could ascertain the positions formerly, held â 
by the members of the California regiment
or the names of their employers. - It 33'
thought that this information can-barg
ained from the parents and that is the
object of requesting them to report at the
headquarters tent, where a list of the.
employers will be compiled. When thÂ«
committee gathers this information ': the.
individual members will make a personal
appeal to the employers to reinstate thÂ« .
soldiers as soon as they are mustered. out.
of the service. ... :V., ' .'â¢
Many have already agreed to do this...
