AFTER A DESPERATE BATTLE
In but Five Rounds Does the
Champion Have the Better
of Sailor Sharkey.
T

Weight Favoring the Big
Californian.
RINGSIDE, CONEY ISLAND SPORTING CLUB,
NEW YORK, Nov. 3.â James J. Jeffries retains the
championship of the world, Referee George Siler giving
him the decision at the cml of the twenty-fifth round over
Sailor Tom Sharkey at the Coney Island Sporting Club to
night. It was one of the most marvelous battles that has taken
plate, and the greatest crowd that ever gathered in the Coney
Island clubhouse witnessed the desperate struggle for su
premacy.
In five rounds Jeffries had the better of the fight â in the
first two and the last three. During the other twenty Sharkey
forced the issue, and. like a bull terrier, was at his man with
both hands, unceasingly. In those twenty rounds Jeffries'
at freight and brawn helped him to hold off the sailor, and
in the twenty-second round he swung in a couple of vicious up
per cuts that made Sharkey groggy. Tom came back again in
the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth, but he was weakened great
ly by Jeffries' vicious blows. ( )ne minute before the gong
sounded to end the fight' Jeffries' left glove came off, and prac
tically the contest was over.
The referee motioned to Jeffries' corner, an American flag
was flung over the champion's shoulders and the crowd on that
i end of the arena cheered wildly. The crowd on the op
side and end, in Sharkey's corner, yelled for Sharkey,
and the men were led back to their dressing-rooms.
The thousands of spectators were banked forty feet high
in the building, the place being packed from ringside to ratters,
and the aisles around the ring were lined. The tremendous
crowd sweated under the glare of 400 arc lights. Fifteen feet
or less from the canvas of the squared circle the heat was in
tense. The fighters were almost exhausted, and the spectators
shriek'- ] themselves hoarse. It seemed at first as though
it would be a short fight, for in the second round Jeffries put the
sailor to the ropes with a left on the jaw. and the referee began
to call off the seconds as Sharkey kneeled on the floor. But
from the third round on Sharkey. with his vicious swings to the
ribs and the jaw, kept the crowd on its feet waiting for a knock
out.
Jeffries, stood the terrific punishment, and with his eye,
nose and ear split came back just as viciously in the last three
ids and almost retrieved himself. Then came the unfortu
â¢ â  and unsatisfactory ending, Jeffries' glove flying off, bring
ing the fight to an end, although the crowd urged Sharkey to
rush in and end it. This he tried to do. but Jeffries fought him
k, and Referee Siler rushed to the rescue. It was notice
able that Jeffries used his weight to its best advantage, throw
ing himself all over the sailor, but the latter did his share of the
hugging, and both were warned repeatedly.
Ten thousand spectators gathered around the ringside. Al
though Coney Island was swept by a gale, the cars came down
crowded to the guards in *a swiftly moving line, and the sports
waded to the narrow entrances leading to the arena. At 8:30
there were 5000 in the building, and later the boxes filled to
overflowing. All manner of men were there, and among those
well known were James J. Torbett and John L. Sullivan, former
champions; Kid McCoy, Peter Maher. Tim Kearns, George
Dixon. Senator Sullivan. Jacob Schaefer, George Slosson,
Frank Hutchinson, Parson Davies, of Chicago; Gus Ruhlin.
Dave Gideon, Mike Donovan and Chief of Police O'Meara,
of Pittsburg; Police Commissioner Sexton; Ed Delaney of Salt
Lake, and Michael Dwyer and P>enny Jacobs of' Detroit.
A preliminary event of ten rounds at
12$ pounds preceded the big event, and
"Kid" Ooulette of Rochester, who looked
a deal like J< -ffri<-s on a small scale, was
beaten by Tommy Moran of Brooklyn.
Then, after a half hour's delay, Tom
Sh.irkey could be seen making his way
through the crowds. He was well re
ceived, but Jeffries was cheered to the
echo. Sharkey had on green trunks, with
an American flag for a belt, and the
champion wore black. Jeffries had be
hind him Billy Delaney, Ernest Roeber, I
Tommy Ryan and his brother, Jack Jef
fries. Sharkey was led to the southwest
corner by Tom O'Rourke and was at
tended by George Dixon, Morris Kelly I
and Tim McOrath, O'Rourke superintend
ing the entire proceedings. George Siler 1
refc *eed.
Jeffries weighed 212 pounds and Sharkey
twenty-flvo pounds less, but the latter
looked to be in better condition, the Cali
fornian being callow and having staring
eyes and giving other evidences of not I
being in the best condition. The betting
at the start was ICÂ«Q to 70 on Jeffries.
They eh., hands and shaped up well. '
JEFFRIES SAYS HIS
HAND WAS INJURED
NEW YORK, Nov. 3.-Sharkey was lucky. My
left hand went back on me in the seventh round,
or I would have knocked him out.
No more picture machines for me. The in
tense heat from the electric lights bothered me
considerably and made me very weak at times.
Sharkey fought very foul, and it's a wonder to
me that Siler did not disqualify him. He repeat
edly butted me with his head and used his elbows
more frequently than his hands.
JAMES J. JEFFRIES.
The San Francisco Call
Jeffries led and then landed several times,
but was generally over or under. On the
other hand, the sailor was wild, going
into the fight with both hands and swing
ing wildly, but he did not land the first
! blow.
Again in the second round Sharkey was
; flopping around, and he came in for a
nasty left that rolled him over. It looked
then as though Sharkey was clearly out
classed. O'Rourke, however, gave the
sailor a talking to, and, to the amazement
of all, Sharkey swung on Jeffries' ribs
and Jaw almost at will, and there was a
wild audience. As the fight went along,
round by round, the sailor fought his
way into the hearts of those who mar
veled at Jeffries" capacity for punishment.
The Californian crouched down low. and,
though his eyes blazed, he smiled, gen
erally over to O'Rourke, who was coach
ing his man over the ropes.
Sharkey's vicious punches began to to]],
and at the close of the seventh round it
seemed as though Jeffries could hardly
walk to his corner, and it seemed certain
there" would be a new champion.

CORBETT SAYS HE IS

: â  CONEY ISLAND, N. V., Nov. 3.â lt was a great fight. I never saw a bet- 8

and it made him like a hull. He rushed,
swinging lefts and rights, ami landed
nearly all of thnm, with Jeffries throw-
Ing himself over the sailor. The Califor
nlan pushed his man over tht- ropes at
every opportunity, and in some of the
rounds rested his great head on Sharkey's
shoulders so much that he was hissed and
Jeered.
Jeffries landed a terrific uppercut In
the tenth and Sharkfy's eyelid was split,
hut in the twelfth Sharkey got back with
a half dozen left swings and a straight
right, and it Is wonderful that they did
not end the fight. Jeffries' hugged the
sailor hanl and shook his head as he
went to his corner.
Every round carried Sharkey across the
ring at the start and he was fighting the
champion all over the canvas. In the
fifteenth Jeffries maue a bluff at forcing,
but Sharkey was at htm again like a
bulldog and swung high and low and
landed almost every time he swung. The
Californian made little effort to lead. He
preferred the defensive and he was wind
ed. Sharkey, too, was tiring fast and
they punched and swung and staggered
and clinched all around the ring for the
next few rounds. The crowd shrieked
from the sound of the gong to the close
of each round. Both men were covered
with blood and Jeffries was bleeding bad
ly from the nose, which Sharkey's savage
right had split.
Suddenly, in the twenty-second round,
Jeffries seemed to take on new life. Just
at the close of this round the champion
swung right and left on Sharkey" s jaw
and almost took him off his feet. Sharkey
reeled and the gong saved him. He came
back hard, however, in the next, but
Jeffries had the better of it, putting in
two right uppercuts. Jeffries 1 friends
howled themselves hoarse, while Shar
key's urged him with lou.l cries to go In
hard and rough It. He threw down his
terrier-like head and though his strength
was fast leaving him he had Jeffries
guessing until the gong sounded. No one
could say who would get in the knock
out blow and neither seemed able to put
enough force into the blow to drop his
man.
In the midst of the twenty-fifth round,
nearly oW minute before the close, Jef
fries' glove flew across the ring,' and
Siler ran to help him on with it. Sharkey
held back until his friends yelled at him
not to stop, and it was a three-cornered
fight for a few minutes. The referee got
Jeffries' glove and tried to draw It on.
This was difficult to do, and then Sharkey
rushed. Jcffrips threw up his gloved and
ungloved hand and with the former up
percut Sharkoy. Siler ran between them
and made a second attempt to assist Jef
i fries. The sailor waited a moment, but,
wildly excited by the shrieks of the spec
tators, he rushed again. Siler dragged
Jeffries away and the gong rang. The
t-,. f,. ,-,.,-. pointed to Jeffries' corner and his
Becotfds and friends cheered wildly.
The majority of those at the ringside
hardly thought Sharkey would get worse
than a draw, for the . sailor fought
viciously, alwuys after his man, with
good judgment, and outpointed the cham
pion. On (he Other hand, Jeffries, while
he had the better by long odds of the last
three rounds, did very little leading in the
j other twenty-two, and when he led he
| was- either too high or two low, getting
in but few good punches.
The decision was not announced from
the ring, or, if it was, few heard it, and
a great mob surged around for several
minutes, yelling and shouting for the vic
tor and vanquished.
When seen in his dressing room* after
the contest Jeffries said:
"Sharkey is the hardest and best man I
have ever met, and 1 hardly expect to
meet a better in the future. Within six
months 1 have met and defeated the two
best men in the world, and will now take
a long rest, probably nine months or a
year. Never again will I fight und-er the
same conditions. The heat from the lights
overhead tended to take away a great
deal of my steam, and the glare from the
i floor weakened my eyes. My left arm,
the one that was injured while training,
gave out in the fourth round, and I could
not use it properly for the rest of the
battle, or the result might have been dif
ferent, for I think that I could have
knocked him out. Sharkey is a game
man and hard to beat, but I had no
thought of any different result at any
time during the battle.
"After my rest, which I think the pub
lic will agree that I deserve. I will again
be ready to meet any and all who aspire
to my title."
Sharkey was inconsolable, and cried like
a child *when he went to his quarters, and
refused to talk; but Tom O'Rourke, his
manager, expressed the opinion that the
sailor should have received the decision.
He said that two of Sharkey's ribs were
broken, and that during the last fotir
rounds Tom's left hand was useless, he
having broken it on Jeffries' head. Al
though the decision was against him, he
said Sharkey would not give up,, but
would seek another match, and the next
time the result would bo different.
"But I don't think this fellow will want
to tackle Tom again," said O'Rourke. "I'll
keep after him, though, until he agrees
to another meeting or make him crawl."

SLEEPS WHILE
JIM FIGHTS
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 3.â Not since the
last national campaign has this city wit
nessed such an outpouring of humanity
and such scenes of enthusiasm as fol
lowed when the wires flashed the infor
mation that Jim Jeffries had for the sec
ond time this year sustained his claims
to the heavyweight championship of the
world. With the words "Jeffries wins!"
a mighty shout went up from the thou
sands that surged about the bulletin
boards. Horns for a brief period added
to the din, that later gave way to march
ing crowds, .iumanlty did not disguise its
feelings. Many a smashed hat tells the
tale of a lost bet, the display of enthu
siasm passing unresented arid received In
the spirit intended. The leading evening
and morning papers rushed extra editions
upon the streets.
Although this Is the home of the cham
pion opinion as to the result of the bat
tle had been so evenly divided that little
money was wagered on the result. This
amount, according to sporting authorities,
will not exceed $10,000 and the odds have
averaged 10 to 7 with Jeffries the favorite.
Many of these bets will not be paid, as
thoy were based on a knockout.

Referee Siler Tells Why He
Decided in Favor of the
Vv^estern Man.
Sharkey Claims He Fought
With Two Ribs Broken
and a Damaged Hand.
BY GEORGE SILER.
NEW YORK, Nov. 3. â To begin with, the fight was the
fastest I have ever seen. I thought when it began that it
would not go over six rounds. The slugging was simply ter
rific. Jeffries started in with right hand body blows hard enough
to stop an ordinary man. or any fighter not as tough as Shar
key. It was simply remarkable that he stood them without giv
ing way under them. Jeffries being the longer in reach, heavier
and more scientific, I thought that Sharkey would begin rush
ing tactics right from the start, and was surprised to see him
stand off and, spar. This I thought was a great advantage to
Jeffries.
Jeffries' seconds claimed fouls repeatedly, and I was com
pelled to caution Sharkey quite often. It seemed that every
time he was hit he went into it bulldog fashion, banging any old
way and roughing it as much as possible in clinches. Several
times during the fight he hit Jeffries alongside the head after
the bell had sounded.
Sharkey seemed to become stronger after about the tenth
round, and Jeffries, it seemed to me. was becoming weak. Shar
key, it struck me, was the stronger of the two around the four
teenth or fifteenth round and had a shade the better of the
fighting. T thought that Jeffries might have been holding
back, as he would come with a spurt quite often, landing hard.
Jim braced up after the twentieth round and had a shade
the better of it for two rounds, although Sharkey would slam in
one occasionally. The last three rounds were all in favor of
Jeffries, who came with a rush, peppered Sharkey severely, up
percut him repeatedly with his right, and had the sailor look
ing a bit queer.
In the twenty-fifth round both came up fairly strong and
both went at it hard. Jeffries continued his uppercutting, but, â 
iiii'ortunatelv toward the end Tiis glove came off, and before I
could replace it the gong sounded, calling the end of the round
and fight. -0

Christian, as members of the church are
known, but he is an honorable man, and
I am proud of my boy."
Mrs. Jeffries says she has not had a
letter from Jim for several days, and :-he
does not know when he will come to the
coast. She did not send him any teie
prams. and none have come from him to

LARGEST WAGER
EVER MADE ON
A PRIZEFIGHT
NEW YORK. Nov. 3.â Prior to the en
trance of the men into the ring "Jack"
Fields, a Wall-street broker and a great
admirer of Sharkey, made the largest
single wager recorded on the battle, and
said to be the largest single wager ever
made on a prizefight. He bet $15,000
against .$21,500 with a business man pres
ent, who did not want his name men
tioned.
After Fields had made his bet quite a
number of shrewd men who respect his
judgment placed wagers on Sharkey at
similar odds.
The betting was lively at the ringside,
with Jeffries favorite at 100 to 70. The
admirers of both men put up plenty of
money, and the aisles of the clubhouse
were continually blocked with eager bet
SHARKEY DECLARES
HE WAS ROBBED
NEW YORK, Nov. 3.â 1 was robbed out of a
justly earned victory. I outpointed Jeffries in a
majority of the rounds and should have had the
decision. I protested against Siler as referee,
knowing that he had a feeling against me and
would give me the worst of it. It was only after
"Tom" O'Rourke had told me that Siler would
give me a fair deal that I consented to have him
act as referee: I think all fair-minded persons
who saw # the fight will say that my fears' about
Siler were well founded. I fought five rounds
with two broken ribs. I think 1 can beat Jeffries,
and I want to meet him again.

FITZSIMMONS
WANTS TO MEET
JEFFRIES AGAIN
CHICAGO, Nov. 3.â 80b Fitzsimmons
was greatly pleased at the result of the
fight, declaring that his contract to fight
the winner brought him once more the
chance to fight Jeffries, who wrested the
championship from him.
"I can't understand, though," said Fitz
simmons, "why Jeffries did not knock him
out. It really looks to me as though he
should have done so, and I am mighty
sorry he did not. I have not anything
particular against Sharkey. if he dirt
help to rob me of the decision in San
Francisco; but if Jeffries had knocked
him out it would have been a clean-cut
affair, with no doubts of any kind about
it. As long as I am going to fight Jeffries

CORBETT'S BULLETINS TO THE CALL
THE FIRST NEWS GIVEN THE PUBLIC
THE tremendous interest taken in
this city in the meeting of Jeffries
and Sharkey was evidenced by the
mass of humanity which packed
Market street in front of The Call
building, and by the heavy wager
ing done on the contest in the local pool
rooms.
The promise of a perfect system of bul
letins marie by The Call was fulfilled to
the letter. James J. Corbett's accurate
description of the fight was by far the
best and was at all times half a round
ahead of those displayed by the other
papers. While the yellow kid was de
scribing: blows being delivered the magic
name JEFFRIES was displayed by The
Call In flaming letters of light from a
cunningly concealed box on 'the front of
the building. The red fire was blazing
from the dome of The Call building, sig
naling to thousands of watchers, before
the Examiner received tardy Information
that the championship battle had ended
and that the title remained in possession
of Jeffries.
Corbett's knowledge of the game
enabled him to note the varying fortunes
of the men, and he was quick to see that
Jeffries had a shade the better of the
tight throughout the majority of rounds
Frum the tenor of the other bulletins the
spectators were led. to believe that Shar
kty was the better man throughout. The
crowd seemed equally "divided between
the two boxers, each being cheered whon
it appeared the tide of battle had turned
in his favor. Shortly before the end of
the light rain commenced to fall, but
could not dampen the ardor of the thou
sands on the streets.
The betting was the heaviest ever done
tn this city on arfy fight. All the pool
rooms handled a lot of money, but the
bulk of it was wagered through Harry
Corbett. On Thursday night he held
$54,000, and when the night ended this had
been swelled to $104,000 In the straight bet
ting. In addition to this a total of $11.9*55
was played in the pads mutuels. BV>r
each dollar invested oa the last line, In
to the chest, Tom slipping to the floor on
one knee. They were sparring When the
bell rang.
Twelfth roundâ They came to a clinch,
with Jeffries Jolting his right to the body
After the break Sharkey tried his right
to the body, but Jeffries blocked. Then
Tom tried a left swing for the body, but
Jeffries ducked nicely and a clinch fol
lowed. Both missed lofts for the head
and clinched again. Jeffries swung his
left on the ribs and met Tom's next rush
with a right under the heart. Jeffries
was now on the aggressive, but at a
signal from O'Rourke Sharkey rushed
and landed his left and right on Jeffries
head. He swung his left three times
on Jeffries' ear. Jeffries , the n
looked at his seconds and winked
knowingly, and, stepping in. ripped
a left and right to Tom's body. They
clinched, _ and after they broke away
Tom swung a lief t, which landed full on
Jim's neck. Every blow in this round
seemed heavy ; enough to fell an ox. but
both men went to their corners smiling.
Thirteenth roundâ As usual Sharkey
was the quicker on his feet. The men
clinched. Sharkey swung a left for the
neck and was countered lightly on the
chest. Jeffries then stepped in with a
right on the body and Sharkey came back
with a terrific swing on the neck, which
staggered the big fallow. Sharkey never
let up for a moment In his attack, and,
after landing a left, Jeff ducked Tom's
loft swing for the neck and the latter,
turning- completely around, landed a back
hand blow on Jeff's ear. It was a pivot
blow and Jeffries' seconds yelled "Foul!"
but Slier poemed' not to hear them and
('.id nÂ«>t caution Sharkey for the pivot.
From this to the end of the round Tom
was the aggressor, with Jeffries blocking.
Fourteenth roundâ Sharkey opened with
a rush and tried a Wt swing for the
head, which barely missed Jeff as the lat
ter sidestepped and Tom struck the
ropes. Tom was still on the aggressive.
They clinched. Tom swung again and
was again cautioned for holding in a
clinch. Sharkey kept forcing matters and
swung his left, just missing the chin, and
in ;i clinch he sent his loft heavily to the
head, rocking Jeffries, who was "still on
the defensive. Jeffries got his left to the
body twice and Tom sent a left to the
neck and Jabbed another to the face. Jeff
shot his right to the ribs and Sharkey
hooked his left to the neck. Tom forced
Jc-ffrles to the ropes and with a well
directed left jab. which landed full on
Jeff's mouth, made the Californian grunt
audibly. Sharkey out-fought his man in
this round.
Fifteenth round â Jeff came up very
cautiously, crouching along the ropes,
and the sailor cut out the pace. Shamey

The straight betting continued through- |
out the light and switched about like a
wrath, r vane in the wind. At times each
man was favorite at odds of 2 to 1, the
betting fluctuating in a remarkable man
ner. This was undoubtedly due to the et
forts of men to hedge out when they
thought the fight was going contrary to
the way they anticipated.

OAKLAND, Nov. 3.â "Jeff wins" was *
flashed on The Call screen to-night, and
instantly there was a wild yell from thou- i
sands of throats. Some time later an
other yell a block away told that the
Chronicle had discovered the news, and
some minutes still later a faint shout four
blocks away was the signal that the Ex
aminer had learned of the fact that the
Reliance Club protege was the undoubted |
champion of the world.
The fact that The Call gave the first
news of the decision in the great light
caused but little surprise, as such thing* 'â 
bave long been taken as a matter of ,
course. The success of The Call's bulletin !
service was the result of carefully ;
planner! arrangements, and although it \
did not have all the wires of the Marconi
system, it secured the news lirst, and with
this fact the argument ends.
By 6 o'clock the bulletins began to ar
rtve, and the fact that The Call had en
gaged ex-Champion Corbett to report ;ho ;
fight was sufficient to bring out a crowd I
that was only limited by the confines of '
Broadway. The completeness of the de- :
scription of the fight as it progressed and I
bore in and swung his left up to the chin
and a moment later sent it home with
great force on the body. Jeffries tried
a left for the face, but Tom got inside
of the blow and swung his left twice with
fearful effect on Jeffrie>s' head and
face. Tom kept plugging away with
right and left. Jeffries still acting on the
defensive. Jeffries got in a good left on
the face, almost putting Sharkey to tne
floor, but the latter sent back left and
right on the face, splitting Jeff's nose,
from which blood came in streams. The
sight of biood on Jeffries' face seemed
to make a demon of Sharkey, who foupht
fiercely and rushed continually, swinging
lc-ft and right wildly, while Jeffries
planted well directed left and right Jolts
to the sailor's body. It was fierce going
when the bell rang.
Sixteenth round â They rushed to
clinches twice without doing anything.
Jeffries got in a right drive under Tom's
heart. Tom swung two lefts on the head.
They came to a clinch, In breaking away
from which Tom got his left over to the
head. Another clinch followed, and as
they broke Tom shot a straight left to
the damaged nose, forcing Jeffries back
to the ropes. Sharkey followed up, but
the big fellow clinched, and when they
broke away again Sharkey whipped his
left twice over the face, drawing blood
from Jeffries' nose and mouth. Jeffries
countered with a right swing on the eye,
which left Sharkey's loft optic red with
blood. Sharkey rushed again, but Jeff
sidestepped and shot his left to the body.
They were fighting fiercely at close quar
ters at the bell.
Seventeenth roundâ Clinch followed
clinch without much damage being done
until Sharkey forced Jeff into a neutral
corner, where he sent three lefts In quick
succession to the boilermaker's head and
got nothing in return. Jim rushed from
a clinch and tried to send his right to
the head, but Tom was inside ..he blow
and drove two hard lefts on the jaw,
each one of them with the force of a
pole ax. After a clinch Jim stepped in
with a left to the body and Tom shot an-
other left to the head. Tom feinted with
his right and, drawing Jeff to him, sent
a straight left close to the mark. Jeffr"e3
countered with a right on the boay. They
exchanged lefts on the head and fought
at close 'luarters until the bell ran.? , Shar
key again sending in one after the gong
sounded. Brady called Slier over and
complained of Sharkey's tactics and w h en
Siler refused to interfere a look of dis
gust spread over Brady's features.
Eighteenth roundâ Tom opened with a
left swing for the head, but Jeff blocked
him. Then they got to close qua- ters and
clinched. After they broke Jeff landed
a right swing on Tom's ear, but the sailor
was right back with three left-hand iabs
the intelligent wording of the bulletins
from the ringside provided an entertain
ment only second to that of being an
actual witness of the great battle.
The people of Oakland have long real
ized that they must obtain their quickest
and most reliable news from The Call,
and in addition to furnishing the new 3
first to the thousands on the street it also
supplied by telephone hundreds of people
from all pver the county. For over three
hours The Call telephone did not have
ton seconds' rest. â¢
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 3.â The Call scored
a ten-strike with the people of Sacramen
to to-nlsnt by the manner in which it
bulletined 'the rounds of the Sharkey-Jef
fries fight. For days past the San Fran
cisco Examiner had been exposing 1 to the
gaze of the populace posters announcing
that it was going to be the first in the
field with the news. However, on tnis oc
casion, f\? on others. The Call showed its
superiority as a disseminator of the first
and freshest news. This was accomplished
it might be added without any preliminary
blowing of trumpets.
The bulletins were made public at ?'he
Call headquarters- diagonally across from
the Golden Eagle Hotel, and not since the
days when great political meetings were
held in that vicinity has" such a crowd
collected. In all directions the streets
fronting the headquarters were thronged
and the street cars were moved with dif
ficulty. "he crowd expressed many com
pliments for The Call's prompt and
enterprise. The bulletins of its San Fran
cisco contemporary were presented in u~e
form, but they had the disadvantage of
being from a minute to two minutes ate,
and with such an anxious crowd a min
ute's delay meant as much as ; an hour.
The Call may justly claim the credit for
having kept the Sacramento people in
formed on to-night's tight ahead of all
other agencies. â¢ â¢ . . :

Clean and Tom swung his left with fearful
force to the body and Jeff shook from the
top of his head to the soles of his feet.
Jeff was more careful after this and kept
on the defensive until the end of the
round, which was decidedly Sharkey's on
points, barring the hugging.
Nineteenth roundâ Sharkey rushed, but
Jeffries was first to land, sending his
right hard under the heart. Sharkey
broke away and hooked his left over to
Jeff's ear. They clinched again and
Sharkey brought his left hard across the
stomach. Jeffries complained that Shar
key was holding him, but Siler thought
differently and told the men to go on and
fight. Sharkey led with a left to the
head. Jeff ducked and put his left
hard on the wind. Sharkey rushed in
again, sending his left to the head and
in a half-clinch sent his free right hand
over the kidney three times. Jeffries
clinched, and after they broke Sharkey
swung his left to the cheek and crossed
his right over on the opposite side. Both
of these blows jarred Jeffries, but he came
back and- jabbed his left to the wind and
shot the same hand straight to Sharkey s
face and the sailor staggered. They were
fighting at close range at the sound of
the gong.
Twentieth roundâ Sharkey, as usual,
was first up and quickest on his feet
and forced Jeffries to a neutral corner,
but failed to land left and right swings
which he attempted. They broke from
a clinch in the middle of the ring and Jef
fries sent his left straight to the mouth.
They exchanged left swings on the ear
and pot into another clinch, from which
the referee had to separate them. Both
men were slower in movement and clinch-
Ed repeatedly without landing a blow.
Sharkey sent two straight lefts to Jeff's
nose, bringing blood In streams, but a few
seconds later Jeff jolted his right under
Tom's chin. Lefts and rights were exchang
ed on the face and chest and a straight left
jab from Jim landed on the sailor's mouth
and jarred the Irishman. The pace in
creased toward the end of the round
without any other damage being done.
Twenty-first round â As usual the fight
ing started on Jpffries 1 side of the ring.
They got to the center in a clinch and Jeff
shot his right to the body. Sharkey re
sponded with two rights over the kid
neys. They exchanged lefts to the face
and Jim stepped in with a hard right on
the body, Sharkey countering lightly.
Jeffries landed another right on the body
and jabbed his left to Tom's face. Both
exchanged rights over the kidneys, while
they laughed at each other semi-good
naturedly. They came to clinch, and af
ter the break Tom swung his left to the
neck, Jim responding with a straight left
on the mouth just before the bell.
Twenty-second roundâ They moved cau
tiously and Jeffries was first to land, send
ing a right to the body. Then he sent a
straight left to the face and Sharkey le
plied with a left swing on the jaw. After
a clinch Jeffries sent his left to Sharkey's
injured eye and the Irishman's optir Be
gan to bleed freely. Tom kept boring in,
but Jim met him twice with straight lefts
on the face. Three times they clinched
and broke and each time Sharkey landed
a back hand right on Jeff's face. Jim
stepped in with a fearful rig-ht upper cut
under the chin and repeated It twice as
they broke from a clinch. Sharkey turned
to his manager, O'Rourke, and laughed,
while Tommy Ryan and other men in
Jeffries' corner ahouXed to him, "Go on!
go on!" Jeffries failed to follow up his
advantage, but the force of these blows
was visible when the bell rang, and Shar
key wobbled perceptibly as he went back
to his corner.
Twenty-third roundâ They came to
gether with a rush in the center of the
ring and Jeff ehot his right to the chin.
They clinched and Tom forced Jeffries'
head back with his left glove under the
chin. When they broke away Jeffries
smiled and feinted with his left, and they
went to a clinch again without anything
being done. They exchanged light lefts
on the head and both missed lefts for the
body. Jim jabbed a straight left to Tom's
Injured eye and Tom clinched after the
break. Jim jabbed his left to the sailor's

away from the referee as Sharkey led for
him with his right, and Tim sent his right

to get between them, and as he did so the
bell rang, ending the fight. The referee
then decided Jeffries the winner.

Communication Not Restored,
But Britons Hope White's
Forces Will Withstand the
Boers' Attacks Until Rein
forcements Arrive.
LONDON, Nov. 4. â The Standard publishes a dispatch
from Luxembourg which says:
"Until within a few days Dr. Leyds has been in telegraphic
communication with Pretoria, through an indirect diplomatic
channel, by means of which he has been able to inform the
Transvaal of the supposed British plan to advance through the
Orange Free State. With a view of anticipating this move
ment the Boers will endeavor to capture or isolate Ladysmith
and then press on to Durban, where they would be able to pre
vent a British debarkation, while the main Boer army would has
tily retrace its steps to defend the line of the Orange River."
At Plymouth it is rumored that the channel squadron will
be ordered to the Cape, where a great naval force is to be col
lected with a view of establishing a cordon from the mouth of
the Orange River to Delagoa Bay to prevent the landing of
supplies for the enemy and with a view also, if necessary, of
landing guns to assist the British forces.
LONDON. Nov. 4, 5. a. m.â Communi- !
cation has not been restored with
Ladysmith. In a message sent
through a colleague at Pletermantz
burg on Tuesday night the Dai.y
Telegraph's war correspondent states that
â¢women, children and other non-combat
ents were being Bent south by train, as
the enemy threatened to attack the town
In force on Wednesday or Thursday.
The Dally Telegraph's special corre
spondent In camp, telegraphing about tne
same time, follows up this information
with the assurance that, although the
situation is disagreeable. it is not regard
ed as critical.
Everything confirms thÂ© Inference that
the Boers are now in their utmost
strength at Ladysmith and were making
preparations for the investment of tne
camp. It was to check or delay this move
ment that General White undertook the
action of Monday, which has so consider
ably reduced his forces.
The naval brigade will In a large meas
ure make up the loss. In the opinion of
the Telegraph's war correspondent the
earlier arrival of the naval contingent
â would have altered the entire character
of Monday's fight. As it was they certain
ly checked the determined advance of the
Boers, who seem to have thought the time
had arrived, with the complete union of
their three great columns, to strike a final
blow at General White's forces, so much
Inferior In numbers to their own. General
Joubert will never have such a chance
again, for every hour brings nearer the
debarkation of an Immense army.
In closing his last dispatch, which got
through from Pletermaritzburg on Tues
day, the Telegraph's war correspondent
Fays that defensive works were then in
course of construction upon the hills near
I^adyemlth, and it was expected the big
naval guns would be mounted at once.
Ladysmith, he also said, is provisioned
for two months.
All accounts concur in showing: chat
General Joubert's forces suffered severe
ly from the British artillery fire on Mon
day, as they have done in every encoun
ter.
The accounts that continue to arrive
regarding the fighting on Farquhar's j
farm Monday only confirm its serious na
ture and the narrow escape General
White had. On this point the Morning j
Post remarks:
"Nothing tells such a tale of battle as
the list of the missing. When the miss
ing exceed the killed it is almost safe to j
writÂ© defeat across the story, because j
â¢missing" means abandonment or sur
render."
It now appears as if it were only the
arrival of the naval contingent from the
Powerful which, prevented a worse dis
aster. It seems that, when it was seen
that the retirement was imperative, two
Natal cavalrymen volunteered^ to convey
a dispatch across the Boer lines to Major
Adye, ordering him to retire, but the risk
was considered too great and flag sig
naling was employed instead. The dist
ance was too great and the ground too
rough for cavalry to go to his assistance.
A dispatch from Colesburg, dated No
vember 1, announces that six police who
were stationed at Colesburg bridge were
surrounded and captured. â  This is prob
ably the origin of the story that the Boers
had occupied Colesburg.
Paris and Berlin continue to supply
statements of British reverses, the latest
being that Mafeking has fallen.
The Paris correspondent of the Daily
News asserts that since the war began

SUNNY WOMEN.
Who has not known the woman whose
disposition is described by that one word
"sunny ?" There's always a laugh lurk-
ing on her lips. Her cheeks are ever
ready to dimple in smiles. Her house-
hold influence is as brightening and
stimulating as the sunshine. Nothing
can be cruder than to have this sunshine
blotted out by disease. But this is a
common cruelty. The young wife who
was the sunshine of the home becomes
its shadow. Every young wife should
know the value of Dr. Pierces Favorite
Prescription in the protection and pres-
ervation of the health. It promotes
regularity, dries the drains which enfee-
ble body and mind, and cures inflamma-
tion, ulceration and female weakness.
It nourishes the nervous system and
gives to the body the balance and buoy-
ancy of perfect health. It is a strictly
temperance medicine.
â  I can say that your medicine cured me,"
writes Mrs. Maud Pearce, of Stoutsville, Hair-
field Co., Ohio. "I had suffered atxvit twelve
veorsfrom female weakness and I had almost
given up. thinking there was no cure for me.
Then I neard about l)r. Pierces medicine and
thought I would try it. and can soy thnt seven
bottles of your ' Favorite Prescription ' made me
well. I am now able to do my own housework.
I took about twelve bottles iv all of Dr. Pierces

forcesâ None killed, seven wounded, none

wounded, 473 missing, the last mentioned

A significant fact indicating the hasty
character of General White's retreat to
Ladysmith is the number of men cap
tured, apart from the members of the
Gloucestershire and Irish FusLleers taken

JOUBERT PROTESTS
AGAINST USE OF LYDDITE
LONDON, Nov. 3.â Belated dispatches
from the British camp at Ladysmith, Na
j tal, add little information regarding Mon
! day's fight except the estimates of the
; Boer losses, which are now said to be 95
; killed and 200 wounded, mostly victims of
j the artillery sheila, which have wrought
such great havoc that it is said General
Joubert. the Boer commander in chief,
; has written a letter to GeneraJ White,
| the British commander, protesting against
the use of lyddite. According to all ac
counts the presence at Ladysmith of the
long-range naval guns and the splendid
shooting of the bluejackets have materi
ally improved the position of the British.
A temporary armistice was declared Mon
day evening to allow of the col.'eetion of
the dead and wounded.
A dispatch from Klmberley dated Octo
ber 29 said all the wounded were doing
well. Small bodies of Boers about 400
strong were then frequently seen. They
apparently came from Mafeking for the
purpose either of assisting In the attack
on Klmberley or to resist the advance of
reinforcements. The absence of water
outside the place causes the Boers to con
tinually move their camps.
ENGLAND CONFIDENT OF
UNCLE SAM'S FRIENDSHIP
LONDON, Nov. 3.â The rumors of the
Continental anti-British coalition continue
to occupy the French papers. Referring
to the alleged Anglo-American under
standing, said to be the outcome of the
Spanish-American war, the Figaro says:
The Washington Cabinet is convince
that had it not been fo the resolute atti
tude of Great Britain the McKinley ad
ministration would have had to face a
European coalition in Spain's behalf to
deprive the ITnited States of the fruits of
victory. The English played so well on
this string that at the present moment, if
Europe did not remain in a position of
Ptri. t neutrality it would not be long be

STRATEGY OF THE BOERS
IS DUE TO AN AMERICAN
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â A former American army officer may be respon
. siDie r,.r the splendid military strategy displayed by the Boers In their re
cent engagement near l.adysmlth. The cable dispatches some days ago men
tioned an American by the name of Blake as leading a Boer command. T was
Uy an army officer to-day that this man was undoubtedly John Y. Fil
more Blake formerly lieutenant in the Sixth United States Cavalry and a
graduate of West Point. The officer with whom 1 talked was a ciassmate
of Blake. He recalled that he had gone to the Transvaal several years ago,
and knowing the oharacter of the man and that he was closely allied with the
Boers, he expressed the opinion that his former classmate was probably a
lead ng spirit in the recent movr-ment which resulted so disastrously to the
British troops. Speaking further, he said that it was evident the Boers
were getting good military advice from some source
t> J h X lm , presf "" n , has . Prevailed hero among sir my men for some time past
that the Boers hod with th.-m a number of ex-army officers from European
countries, but it was not supposed that any forrm-r American officer was
engaged with them until the name of Blake was mentioned in the dispatches
some days ago^ Blake is a daring fellow of the cowboy type. He was ap
pointed to the Military Academy from Arkansas, and one of his classmates re
called to-day that when he first appeared at the Military Academy he af
forded a great deal of amusement to the other cadets by reason of his wild
Western make-up and mannerisms. HÂ« graduated In 1876 standing high in
his class and was assigned to the Sixth Cavalry, then serving in Texas

BOMBARDMENT OF MAPEKING.
LONDON, Nov. 4.â A special corre
spondent of the Dally Mail at Mafeklng,
under date of October 22, says:
"General Cronje's bombardment of
Mafeking was monotonous. The Boers
fired sixty-two shell?, but did no harm,
the whole townâ even the ladiesâ laughing
at the affair. He threatens to bring a
forty-pounder from Pretoria, Crnnje says
he jjj sorry for the women's sake that he
phelled the town, but it was not playing
the pame to send dynamite trucks among
his men. Fifteen hundred of his com
mand have since departed to the south
ward. Small parties of our garrison is
sued forth nightly .and harassed the out
post I hear that the Daily Mail's corre
spondent at Lohatsi Is a prisoner in the
hands of the Boers," â¢ '
CAPE TOWN. Nov. 1 (delayed In trans
mission).âThe Cape Times says It has
reliable information that there have been
no casualties among the British at Ma
feklng since October 13. After the heavy
bombardment General Cronje asked the
town to surrender. Colonel Baden-Powell
was asleep when the messenger arrived,
but on being awakened received him hos
pitably and politely replied: "I will let
you know when we have had enough."
ENGLAND'S UNPREPAREDNESS.
HERON. Nov. 3.â The statement of the
British Secretary of State for War, Mar
quis I^ansdowne. at the cutlers' feast In
Sheffield yesterday, that the military pre
parations in the difficulty with the Trans
vaal could not be n.ept ahreast of the dip
lomatic negotiations has evoked severe
comment on the part of the German press.
The Neuste Nachrlchten says: This as
sertion will- amaze the world, and espe
cially Germany, for it implies either that i
the army and diplomacy of Great Britain
are unequally balanced or that both are
inefficient. For the purpose of compari
son we need but recall Germany's pre
paredness in IH7O and the fact that Count
yon Moltke on the first day of the mobili
zation was found reading a novel. I>ord
L,ansdowne's statement only confirms the
opinion of outside critics that the British
nation Is no longer an efficient tool for
politics on a vast scale. Perhaps Eng
land's experiences in South Africa will
suffice to bring home the national instinct
of the British the necessity for a radical
reorganization of the British military sys
tem.
AN ACT OF COURTESY.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 3.â Permission has ;
been given to agents of the British Gov
ernment to compress in New York and
Boston a large shipment of Canadian hay
destined for the use of the British army
in South Africa. It was represented to
the Treasury Department that at present
there are no suitable presses in the Do
minion which are available, and as it is
important that the shipment should leave
these ports not later than the 35th of the
present month the Government was ap
pealed to to make the concession. This
was d6ne as an act of courtesy to he
British Government and is not regarded
as a precedent. The British agents rep
resented that, while the hay shipments
from Canada probably would be very I
large they expected to have modern com- j
: presses ready for use within a short time !
| In the sections where the hay Is raised.
BOERS HAD PRACTICE.
LONDON. Nov. 4.â The Paris corre
spondent of the Daily Mail says:
"I learn that the Transvaal and Free I
State Governments before the war placed |
large orders with the gunmakers at Le i
Creuzot, but that not all the weapons
could be delivered owing to the sudden- |
ness with which hostilities began. The j
guns the Boers are actually using are â 
Creusots 75-milimeter quick-firers and 155- j
milimeter siege and garrison guns, all
mounted on light carriages and adapted
In every possible way for use over muddy
roads. They had two months' firing prac- |
tlce under competent Creusot agents. If |
they could have had another month's i
practice no European artillerist could
have withstood them."
AUSTRALIA'S CONTINGENT.
SYDNEY, N. S. W., Nov. 3.âTremen
dous enthusiasm was displayed to-day on
the occasion of the embarkation of the
second detachment furnished by the Col
ony of New South Wales for service In

The Premier, Mr. L,ynne, has communi
cated to the other Australian Premiers a
suggestion that the Colonies should dis
patch to South Africa another body of
troops to be called the Australian contin
gent. He says that if necessary 10,000
men could be sent.

parently mounting more heavy guns to

BIDDING CLOSE
FOB CRUISERS
Remarkable Similarity
of Figures.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.
--[ One remarkable feature about the bids
j tendered a few days since for the con
struction of six sheathed cruisers of 3200
tons Is that the figures are so close. A
â  year ago, when the contracts were given
out for the tour monitors, charges were
made that the shipbuilders had formed a
trust, but this accusation was vigorously \
refuted, and, under the circumstances, the i
present close figuring Is no doubt simply
a coincidence, so far as relates to three
of the bidders, and may as a whole be
accepted as an evidence of our shipbuild
ers knowing what their work is worth.
â¢ Confining the competition to the five
firms, whose bids range from $1,039, to
. $1,116,000 (which bars out the Burlee Dry
dock Company's bid), it will be seen that
the highest bidder exceeds the lowest by
only 7.3 per cent, while the bids of three
of the firms are practically the same, and
that there is only $260 difference between
the figures of the Bath and the Union i
Iron works. As a rule, novices in Davy
contract work bid very low, while there
are others whose tenders are either pur
posely too high or informal, so as not to
be taken seriously; but when an old, ex
perienced firm like the Columbia Iron
Works puts up its figures ', per cent
higher than that of the Union Iron Works
there is a mystery about these bids which
the absence of a combination only tends
to Intensify.

Firm names against which a star -appears are
new. bidders for navy work, and those with a
t have contracts on band for torpedo-boats.
It will be noted that neither Cramps nor
the Newport News people made often to
build these cruisers, the reason, no doubt, i
being that their yards are more than
busy with mercantile and naval work.
Then again, these cruisers are somewhat
different In their construction from other
naval vessels are comparatively more.
costly, because they are to be wood- j
sheathed and coppered, This involves
considerable painstaking work, which Is
expensive and Is new to most of the
yards.
Congress placed a limit of $1,141,800 as
! the cost of these cruisers, exclusive of
armament, but including hulls, machl- â¢
nery, equipment and general outfit. The
latter two Items may be roughly esti
mated at $100,000, leaving $1,041,800 as the
contract cost for hull, machinery, boats,
spars, furniture, etc.- Upon this basis the
bids of Lewis Nixon, the Bath and Union
iron works are within the limits, and each
of these firms Is likely to receive orders
I to build two of the cruisers. The Navy
Department reserves the right to refuse
bias which, although they may be the
lowest, may not be acceptable for other
; reasons; but it is just possible that the
I Richmond firm's bid of $1,027,000 may be
I accepted, because of the geographical po
] sltion <â¢; that yard and that the work
j will be distributed from Maine to Vir-
I ginia on the " Atlantic seaboard, and that
San Francisco will get one and perhaps
two of these cruisers.
The contract cost of these vessels is
considerably higher than those of a
near!;, similar type and size built In Eng
land in 1891, where eight vessels of the
Rainbow class were contracted for at an
average cost per ton of $225. The Rain
bow and Bister ships are sheathed cruis
: ers of 3600 tons and nineteen knots speed,
while the Denver class of the United
Slates navy about to be built is only 3200
tin and are to have 16V& knots. The sev
eral bids show the cost per ton to be as
I follows:
I Trims, Richmond, $321, or 43.5 per cent
over British cost
1 Lewis Nixon, $325, or 44.4 per cent over
I British cost
Bath Iron Works, $325.5, or 44.G per cent
over British cost.
Union Iron Works, $325.6, or 44.7 per cent
over British cost. %
These figures are instructive, as they
indicate a difference of practically 50 per
\ cent excess of cost in this country over
similar navy work in England, and If itâ
i a* it probably doesâ applies similarly to
mercantile work, explains why our ocean
merchant marine fails to expand. An
other peculiar feature about these bids
is the fact that, notwithstanding the
higher wages paid on this coast as com
pared with Eastern, and notwithstanding
the cost of transportation of material 3000
miles and the attendant delays, the Union
I Iron Works of San Francisco can build
las cheaply as is done 'in Maine. This
proves cither that conditions in San Fran
cisco are so favorable as to overcome
other drawbacks or that the builders of
the Oregon are content with very small
profits.
Mornn Brothers of Seattle, Wash., ship-
I builders, have submitted to the Navy De
partment another bid. to take the place
of that submitted last' Wednesday for
the construction of the 3500-ton cruisers.
The firm does (his on the theory that
Congress intended that at least two of
the six vessels should be constructed on
the Pacific Coast, and as the Union Iron
Works of San Francisco, the only other
i bidder on the slope, bid for only < one of
I the ships, the Seattle firm feels that if it
'reduces It? original bid to the same figure
as that of the San Francisco corporation
it should ' have It considered on even
I terms. The proposition being, irregular,
it has been referred to the board of con-
I struction, and general opinion is con
struction, and the general opinion is that
, it cannot be entertained.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. S.â Several funny
I turns have been made in the management
< of the affairs of the defunct Union Say-
I ings Bank, but the most ridiculous oc
! curred to-day, when ex-Boss Rea, who i:s
', the president of the institution, declared
, war on Archer & Archer, attorneys for a
! number of depositors, and instructed the
' bank's attorneys to begin proceedings to
disbar the attorneys. Tuesday Archer &
' Archer began 1115 suits against the stock
i holders of the bank In the interest of sev
! enteen depositors for their pro rata lia
| bility to the latter. Among the people
suco* were the directors of the bank, jSaen
, depositor sued from 138 stockholders down
i,, about a dozen. The amounts asked
I range from 2 cents up to *sn. Rea brought
the matter up at the meeting to-day, He
said the suits were annoying, unnecessary
and unwarranted, and were brought for
the purpose of dividing the costs that
would be derived from the suits with the
Justice in whose court they had been
Hied lie 'said the attorneys should be
tarred and feathered, and denounced
them In stronger terms. lie made a mo
tion that disbarment proceedings be com
| menced against them at once, There was
no second to the motion. Rea declared if
there were no objections the proceedings
would be so ordered, and it was so re
corded on Secretary Friant's minutes.
Lawrence Archer, tne senior member of
the firm of Archer & Archer, is one of the
best known men in the State. He has
held many prominent positions In this
county., i.nd at one time was a County
Judge. Attorney? laugh at Rea's attempt
to disbar the lawyer?, and in all probabil
ity the bank's attorneys will refuse to
act.
The directors announce that In order to
collect $300 or $100 some $15,000 or $20,000
court costs will be incurred! and they de
clare that these will be divided between
the Justice and the attorneys.
Ex-President Ward Wright is worrying
the bank officials some. A few days after
1 the bank failure he deeded his line resi
dence on North First street to the bank
for the benefit of that institution. In the
\ last few days Wright sold the residence
to Horace Vachell, totally ignoring the
deed he gave to the bank. Rea spoke bit
terly of Wright, and eaid that at the time
he gave the property to the bank it was
i to save him from State prison, and that
unless he squared things with the bank
he was in favor of prosecuting him. The
; bank's attorneys were instructed to take
I steps to oust Vachell from the property
and try to regain the property for the
| bank.
The rest of the meeting was devoted to

CABINET CONSIDERS
REPORT ON PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â The Cabinet
meeting lasted two hours, much of , the
time being spent in the reading and dis
cussion of the preliminary report of the
Philippine Commission. The report was
considered very satisfactory and received
the full approval of the Cabinet. There
was some incidental discussion of the
status of our. insular possessions In rela
tion to the Postal Union.
The particular point under discussion
was that Involving the right under the
law of our soldiers in the Philippines to
send through the mails to friends in this
country souvenirs of little or no commer
cial value. Under a strict construction of
the law articles of any commercial value
except books are prohibited from being
sent through the mail. â  But the Govern
ment, realizing that with the approach of
the Christmas holidays the soldiers serv
ing in the Philippines undoubtedly will
wish to send home some mementoes of
their service, an earnest effort will be
made to overcome the difficulties present
ed. It is probable that Secretary Gage
will formulate some regulation which will
meet the situation.
The subject of a civil government for
Cuba also received considerable attention.
The necessity for a change In the present
military system, it Is said, becomes more
and more apparent, and the President Is
waiting only until an entirely suitable per
son can be found before taking action in
that direction. General Wood is said to
be very favorably regarded In this con
nection, there are obstacles to his ap
pointment which at present are deemed
unsurmountable. One of them ie that
there are a number of officers In Cuba
who rank General Wood, and his promo
tion over their head is not deemed ad
visable. .....,â¢

ONE NATION TO
SOON WITHDRAW
Negotiations Relating to
Samoan Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. S.-Active nego
! tlatlons having for their object the dis
solution of the Samoan agreement are in
progress between the I'nited States, Great
I Britain ;-nd Germany. These negotiations
are being conducted in London and VVaah
| ington. It is evident from what can be
! learned that the United States will be
i come the possessor of Tutuila Island and
certain rights In other islands and that
j either Germany or Great Britain will
i withdraw from the group. The authori
i ties would prefer Great Britain as a
neighbor, but Germany has larger inter
, ests In the Island of T'polu and the British
, Government may come to the conclusion
that it would be wiser for It to relin
quish its interests In the Island.
I Officials of the department with whom
I talked told me to-day that the three
powers are considering propositions which
I ?ach submitted. Both Great Britain and
Germany understand that the Tnited
, btates proposes to stand In the control of
| Pago Pago harbor and therefore ueslre
* the island of Tutuila, which forms part
;of the coast line. Naturally the Germans
in Samoa are greatly opposed to the with
drawal of their Government, but if Ger
many could secure adequate compensation
she may be willing to relinquish her claim
;to the islands. The compensation, how
ever, will probably be fixed bo high that
Great Britain will be unwilling to give it.
The German Minister and British
Charge d'Affalres were both at tlif State
Department to-day consulting with Secre
tary Hay in relation to propositions sub
mitted by each of the governments and
it is the hope now that an agreement will
be reached more quickly than heretofore
had been anticipated.
The war In South Africa naturally
makes Great Britain more desirous of
eliminating- from hor international rela
tions questions which may assume a hos
tile aspect than she would If she were at
peace, and while undoubtedly the British
Government will protect its interests in
Samoa it ts believed that she will prove
more conciliatory and that consequently
the agreement will not be difficult of ac
complishment.
FUNSTON VICTIM OF
A MISUNDERSTANDING
Member of Minnesota Regiment Says
Catholic Churches Were Used
as Blockhouses.
MINNEAPOLJS, Nov. 3. â Thomas
Campbell, late of the Thirteenth Minne
sota Regiment, Fays the controversy be
tween General Funston and Archbishop
Ireland regarding church desecration In
the Philippines is based on a misunder
standing of the facts. He says that he
himself is a Catholic and that there wore
a s=' .-ore or more of Catholics In his com
patty, all of whom had as many church
relics as did their Protestant comrades.
The reason, he says, is that the .Filipinos
themselves bad desecrated the churches
before the United States troops came.
The buildki^s were loop-holed for small
arms and used ns storehouses and hos
pitals, so that the destruction of the
buildings became a strategic necessity
The paraphernalia cither had to be taken
away or suffer destruction with the build
ing.

HEEDED REFORMS
ON OUR ISLANDS
Problems Being Slowly
Worked Out.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â The difflcul
i ties attending the administration of jus
j tlce In Cuba and Porto Rico are pointedly
j brought out in reports to the advocate
! general of the army. General Lieber,
! whose annual report was made public to
j day. Major Dudley, at Havana, states In
; the course of a report:
The present situation hi;re has not exact pre
| cedent, In that during a time of peace we are
In temporary military occupation of a friendly
territory^ not our own land, pledged to dig- â 
j charge the obligations that may under interna
tional i3\v result from the fact that such occu
pation fi. r the protection of life and property,
and to withdraw from the island so sunn as "a
I stable Kovernment of its own shall be estab
lished.
The opposition to a complete change of the
spirit, methods and technicalities of the Span
ish law, as now maintained In the system of
"incommunicado" for example, is espcciallv 'â 
surprising. But though slow in coming, the
assertion of such personal rights and liberties
as are already enjoyed by Americans under
American law will come sooner or later, as be
ing essential to a free, self-governing people,
such as toe Cubans desire to be.
J. Dunn, judge advocate of the Depart
ment of Santiago and Puerto Principe,
makes similar observations and says:
The supreme law on the Island of Cuba Is
that of the supreme power of the United States,
and will te so lone as an American remains
nore under existing conditions, be that for one
month or forever.
Major Sharp, acting judge advocate of
Porto Rico, reviews the manifold diffi
culties in dealing with brigandage, tho
complex customs relating to marriatre
and divorce, the crowding of iails with
men, women and children, who literally
rot while justice proceeds at snails' pact*.
He says every substantial reform is eag
erly received by the people, the opposition
coming from the small conservative ele
ment. iJe deprecates the premature with
drawal of this Government and the es
tablishment of a territorial form of gov
ernment, as some of the Porto Rican
newspapers demand, and says it would be
the most unfortunate measure that could
possibly befall the island. He adds:
Continued military control for a reasonable
time, aided by wise advisory councils, cannot
fall to secure gradual but steady and ultimate
assimilation by the people of our best American
thought, and methods of administration.

CROKER BEFORE
MAZET'S TRIBUNAL
Attempts to Make Polit
ical Capital.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. s.â Whatever expec
tation there was that Richard Croke
would make a scene before the Assembl;
Committee on the management of thi:
city was not fulfilled.
In the course of an address before a
political meeting a few days ago Chair
man Mazet asserted In effect that when
the gas charter was introduced in the
Legislature by him, that measure being
inimical to the New Amsterdam Gas
Company, and. it is alleged, in the inter
est of the Consolidated Gas Company,
Mr. Croker proposed to withdraw his op
position to the bill if the Consolidated
Company would buy at his price stock of
the New Amsterdam Company which he
held. It was to make denial of this state
ment that Mr. Croker yesterday demand
ed a hearing before the committee.
Mr. Croker was at the committee room
early to-day. Before the proceedings
were begun the Republican members of
the committee and counsel met and had a
protracted conference. Immediately on
calling the committee to order Chairman
Alazet asked:
"Is Mr. Croker present?"
The Tammany chief responded: "I am
here under oath, I presume, and I want
to deny a statement which you made in
your campaign speeches in your district."
Mr. Mazetâ AVhat is that you want to contra
dict?
Mr. Crokerâ l want to contradict the speeches
you have made !n reference to my dealings
with the Consolidated Gas Company; that 1
tried to sell Amsterdam stock to that com
pany. That is what I understood you to say In
your speech. I aÂ»v.y that now on the stand
Mr. Mazetâ ls that all, Mr. Croker?
Mr. Crokerâ That is all.
Mr Maiet-rTou are excused.
Mr Crokerâ Will you take the stand and tes
tify to what you said?
Mr. Mazetâ Mr. Croker, will you please step
down from the stand?
Mr. Croker then left the stand and the
room. Subsequently Chairman Mazet
gave out the following statement:
Mr. Crr&er knov.-s that this Is no place and
no time to settle the question between him
and me. What I said on the stump I said not
of my own knnwl<>fig:<\ but upon ffood and suf
ficient authority. If Mr. Croker really wisher
to have the- truth of my statf-ment tested he
can sue me for libel or ho can Drosecute me
criminally by a friendly District Attorney.
Here we cannot even comÂ»el Mr. Croker to
answer proper questions, or compel any wit
ness to testify on this, matter, as the question
between us Is not relevant to this inquiry.

SCHREIBER'S
STABLE IS
SUSPENDED
Running of Forte and Alumi
num Caused the Trouble.
Ward Under the Ban.
Two of the horses belonging to Barney
Schreiber's stable, Forte and Aluminum,
turned complete somersaults at Oakland
yesterday, or, more familiarly speaking,
displayed pronounced reversals of form.
As a consequence the stable of the St.
Louis bookmaker and light-weight Jack
Ward are under a cloud, having been
placed on the suspended list by the offi
cials across the bay pending an investiga T
tion.
On October 25 Forte, starting for the
first time this season, was heavily
backed and won easily from Donator and
Rainier. Three days later the same
horse started again at the same distance,
om> and a sixteenth miles, a stanchly
backed choice, and ran absolutely last.
yesterday ho was favorite for the third
event and won very cleverly frum Dare
H and Merry Boy. Monday," October SO,
Aluminum finished last in a five furlong
scramble taken by Magdalenas. Yester
day, at odds of 40 to 1, the pelding cap
tured a selling 1 handicap over the Fu
turity course from Alaria and a good
field. Barney Schrelber is expected nere
next week, when the matter will be given
a thorough probing.
The track was fairly fast and four
choices led their fields out. "Ward and
Ranch each piloted two of the winning
horses.
In the opening sprint Dnnie], one of the
first choices, with Ranch up, run all
ar iund and through his field, winning
driving from Isabelle, a 60 to 1 shot. The
latter was the supposed good thing, her
price beln^ cut to 15 at post time.
Dr. Sheppard at odds on led Los Me
danop, a 25 to 1 chance, out for the seven
furlong purse event. Ilohenzollern ran a
close third.
Backed from 6 to 5 to 7 to 10, Forte.
under urgent riding, caught Dare II at
the paddock, placing the third purse to
the credit of Harney Schrelber. Show
honors went to Merry Boy.
The mile selling dash for two-y^ar-olds
proved a cakewalk for My Gypsy, the
favorite. Ailenna lost the place to
Kickumbob, the rank outsider of the
qunrtet starting.
Dr. Rowell's Whltcomb went to tho post
favorite for the fifth recital, a scramble
over the Futurity course, and ran third.
Aluminum made all the running, and in
a drive downed the wretchedly ridden
Alaria half a length.
Only off the cars a week. Mororlto,
whlfli seems to be an iron mare, took tho
closing six furlong run cleverly from
Mike Rice. Amasa, the favorite, failed
to last out, running unplaced.

Improvements at the Grove.
PACIFIC GROVE, Nov. 3.â Architect B.
M. Frazier arrived here this week to take
charge of extensive alterations to be made
in the Assembly Hall of the Methodist
Episcopal Church at this place The
Assembly Hall is the place in which all
â  the conventions held in Pacific Grove
| during the summer convene, and its pres
ent size and arrangement has been found
incompatible with the enlarging plans of
the Pacific Improvement Company and
Pacific Grove Retreat Association to make
this city a meeting place for interstate
as well as State conventions.
The alterations will include doubling the
seating capacity as well as greatly im
proving the hall's Interior and exterior
appearance. Mr. Frazier, the architect,
has had much to do with church archi
tectural work, having made church archi
tecture his chief study while in Europe.

POLITICAL.
CITIZENS'
NON-PARTISAN
PARTY.
FOR GOOD GOVERNMENT.
To the Voters of San Francisco: The Non-
Partisan party was organized seven years ago
to wrest from professional politicians the con-
trol of municipal affairs and to separate en-
tirely from national politics the selection of
city and county officials.
It has at all times opposed machine politics,
and sought to elect worthy men to office by in-
dependent nomination or indorsement.
The last Legislature passed a law expressly
aimed at the "unwelcome interference" in
public affairs of non-partisan organizations.
The Rickard act forbids any Information on the
ballot concerning the indorsements that a can-
didate may receive and makes It impossible for
a man to be nominated by ! two parties. Such
a creditable occurrence as the nomination last
year by the two great parties of John Lack-
mann for Supervisor could not be repeated.
We regard this law as pernicious In principle
and against public .policy, and we intend to
vigorously contest It.
The adoption of a non-partisan charter, the
result of the last primary election, and the in-
dependent character of the recent Republican
and Democratic conventions, clearly Indicate,
however, that the friends of good government
have awakened to their duties.
With these changed conditions we feel that
j there is no occasion for an entire Non-Partisan
ticket at this election.
It is, however, a fundamental principle of
I this party to support those nominees who have
faithfully and fearlessly filled their offices and
are renominatP'l for the same office. We would
fail in our obligations were we to leave this

OFFICIAL RECOGNITION.
THERE is an inharmonious note in the official
report of Admiral Crowninshield, chief of the
Bureau of Navigation in the Navy Depart
ment.
It makes bitter complaint, amounting to an issue
against Congress, of failure to officially honor officers
of the navy. It has been known for a year that there
were bitter heartburnings and uncompromising
jealousies between naval of'ncers. It has been more
than suspected that the unstinted official and popular
honors paid to Dewey have made mora than one
heart ache. The contention between the champions
of Sampson and Schley has gained strength, and j
to-day is warmer than ever.
Admiral Crowninshield says: "Of the officers who
served in the North Atlantic waters three have been
confirmed in the recognition urged by the depart
ment â two because their cases were presented at pro
pitious moments, the other because of a misapprehen
sion." This language will raise another series of Is- !
sues. Does the admiral mean that two officers were !
recognized, not because of merit and achievement, |
but because of the favorable time chosen to present |
their cases, when enthusiastic patriotism sought an !
outlet by honoring somebody, and that the third >
case was a mistake of the department in misplacing j
its approbation? On the general subject the admiral I
says: "Another condition of affairs discouraging to
proud and ambitious officers who risked and ac
complished much is the ragged and irregular result
that seems the inevitable consequence of any effort to
give permanent or substantial recognition to bravery
or gallantry or devotion." As Congress ii the voice
of the country in expressing such recognition, this
is a severe rebuke to that body. It is, in effect, ac- I
cused of that ingratitude which Is a proverbial at
tribute of republics. He says that every effort of the
department to redeem its solemn pledge of recogni
tion has been balked.
It is to be regretted that such an indictment of
Congress has been made public It does not give the
country a good appearance before the world. The
navy did its whole duty in the Spanish war. No
navy of any other country ever so distinguished it
self in so short a time. At the beginning of the war
the opinion of European naval experts was that we I
were outclassed on the water by Spain. That opinion
was rather widely shared at home. The country was,
indeed, prepared for disaster in the first marine en
counters. Millions of our people never saw the sea.
Being inlanders, all they knew of the navy was
through an inland press, which knew the navy rather
as a sentiment than as a force to be reckoned with.
A majority of Congress represents non-maritime dis
tricts, and is charged with the promotion of interests
which dimly recognize any relation to deep water.
In this situation members of Congress defend them
selves by pointing to what they call "navy politics."
When the department recommendations went to Con
gress it is alleged that partisans of the different offi
cers appeared in the lobby, and that open attempts
were made by the advocates of one officer to pull
another officer down. The native States of the offi
cers concerned took part in the fight, and it is said
that a most unseemly condition developed, for which
Congress was not at all responsible. Pride and am
bition infuriated the contending forces, and those
sentiments have never yet appeared among men with
out causing trouble.
Then, again, the army had achieved somewhat, and
its position had to be considered. Immediately there
appeared another vexatious manifestation of human
nature, which naval education and. discipline had not
eradicated. From the navy issued criticisms of the
: ; rmy and belittling comments on its officers. This
did not by any means tend to placate the situation.
The navy seemed as to its own achievements to be
divided into as many camps as there were officers
recommended for recognition, but their mutually hos
tile camps were united in a sneering policy toward
the army.
It is not to be wondered at that, In such a situation
of seething personal and professional rivalries. Con
gress may have blundered in its action, or, in
weariness of It all, may have put off action altogether
to a more convenient and a calmer season.
The policy of criticizing the civil branches of the
Government by either army or navy officers should
not be encouraged. Civil government represents the
people who bear the burdens of a large military and
naval establishment. In civil life the people sustain
the sources of national greatness with patience and
industry, and do not resort to Congress for recogni
tion of the sacrifices they make, though these are
often great.
It will be better for the sen-ice and the country to
have less appearance of rivalry and jealousy, for then
will there be less occasion to attack Congress.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 4. 1899.
STATE ISSUES.
GOVERNOR BUDD, when he handled the blue
pencil in the Executive office at Sacramento,
6ustained a reputation as an official entomolo
gist and a skillful hunter of bugs in every "act entitled
an act" sent to him by the Legislature for approval or ,
rejection. He discovered that scales, white and black, i
San Jose, cushiony cotton and of other varieties, in- I
fested legislative measures, and did not hesitate to ap- !
ply the Vedalia Australis, in the form of a veto, when
ever necessary, to destroy these troublesome para
sites.
He is now enjoying "mute, inglorious ease" as at
torney for the Harbor Commission. It is evident
that he has not lost any of his skill as a bug-hunter.
Perhaps the presence of limnoria and teredo in the
water-front piling keep him in touch with the avo
cation followed during his official career.
He is a stout champion of Mayor Phelan and the '
ticket, because it is a Democratic ticket. Walls are i
not built high enough, nor can they be sufficiently
parapeted with broken glass, to keep Governor Budd
away from a Democratic ticket. Through Mayor
Phelan's thick disguise of non-partisanship, and even
under his tattooing of Republican principles which he
wears when out among Republicans to persuade them
to bolt their ticket, Governor Budd's practiced eye
sees the straight thing. No domino can hide parti
san Democracy from him. He has a sincere interest
in the welfare of his party, and, being its most astute
politician and leader, has not failed to observe that
Mayor Phelan's nocturnal song of anti-partisanship
has a tendency to release Democrats from their party
allegiance. The Governor knows a nightingale from
a filliloo bird when he hears it sing, and, as often
in the past, was called on to save his party from mis
taking one for the other.
The Mayor's policy, originating in his personal
ambition and always returning to its source for re
freshment and renewal, required the nomination of
Mr. Charles Wesley Reed on the ticket. But Mr.
Reed is a goldbug and is believed to have voted for j
McKinley. Mr. Reed is an orator, as Brutus was,
but his voice has been missed in the campaign
diapason to which Phelan and Lane have been the
principal contributors. It became necessary to show
that Mr. Reed's vocal chords were not impaired and
that his Democracy was sound in wind and bottom.
Therefore a debut was prepared for him on Thurs
day night, and as his case was a bad one Governor
Budd was sent for to try and pull him through.
The Governor talked well, as he always does, and,
as is his custom, fired the Democratic heart to a con
flagration. But the Governor is consistent, and, be
sides that, he appointed the Harbor Commission and
is its attorney. Now the Phelan platform, in reach
ing out for any unemployed prejudices that might be
useful, arraigned the policy of the Harbor Commis
sion, denounced port charges and detected a general
bad smell on the water front. This was too much for
the Governor. He did not propose to act as "the
terrible example." So he said frankly that part of the
platform is not true. He compared port charges with
other harbors to the advantage of San Francisco, and
then, in fear that this bug in the platform might get
away from him, said: "This draws in State issues
and is inconsistent with our attitude in this fight and
entirely outside the limit of municipal concerns. We
are not on a State platform. We are on a local plat
form. The portion of the platform which invades the
province of the State is its criticism of port charges.
This criticism is untrue. It is therefore politically un
wise and logically incorrect."
The followers of Phelan now wait, with foreheads
corrugated by anxiety, to see what answer their chief
will make to this proof of inconsistency.
Now comes William Fife Jr., designer of the Sham
rock, and says if he had been in command she would
have beaten the Columbia. It is an easy boast to
make, but its only effect will be to show that every
body interested in the British craft has not taken the
defeat as gracefully as Sir Thomas Lipton.
COLLEGES OF COMMERCE.
ONE of the notable features of the Commercial
Congress in Philadelphia was the discussion
concerning what sort of education our uni
versities should give to fit young men for a commer
cial career. Several eminent men took part in the
conference, among them being President Eliot of
Harvard and President Low of Columbia. The ad
dress of Eliot was particularly strong and has been
made the subject of no little comment in the Eastern
press.
The college of commerce in a university is to be
quite a different thing from the commercial colleges
and business colleges which have long been familiar
to our educational system. The existing colleges do
excellent work, but they rarely undertake to do more
than fit young men and women for taking advanced
clerkships or positions as accountants. The college
of commerce in a university contemplates something
on a larger scale, and accordingly will require a much
! higher standard for admission.
President Eliot is reported to have laid much
stress upon the importance of providing in the high
schools a special training for students who wish to
take a commercial course at the university. He urged
that such students must acquire, before undertaking
a college course, a mastery of the two or three for
eign languages which would be essential to their after
studies, not merely a reading acquaintance with them,
I but the ability to speak them. This and all other ele
j mentary study should be accomplished before en-
J tering the college course, because it can be done
j much easier at the earlier age, and because the time
and strength thus saved are needed in the later work.
There can be no question of the soundness of that
view, but it is clear the policy is one which will have
to be developed slowly. It will be no easy thing to
j provide such thorough training in languages in the
! schools of our public educational system. For a
time at least the colleges of commerce will have to
I undertake the instruction in languages after the stu
dents have been admitted. It is of advantage, how
ever, to have the ideal standard of what university
commercial training should be set forth at this early
stage of the development of that system of instruc
tion. We have in our State University a college of
commerce from which much is expected, and it is not
at all likely President Wheeler will be content with
any lower standard than that set up at Harvard, so
we look for a new departure to be taken in second
ary education as an inevitable outcome of the de
mands of the university for well prepared students
for its commercial college.
The Non-Partisans are making their usual grand
stand play about impartiality concerning the parties
to which candidates belong, but from the prominent
leadership given among them to Phelan's brother-in
law Sullivan it appears that however indifferent they
may be to political connections they are not neglect
iul of family regions.
A few days ago it was reported that the British
would transfer their interests in Samoa to Germany
and leave us in the lurch, but yesterday it was an
nounced that Germany would sell out to Great
Britain. It is safe to say that neither report is cor
rect. In fact, for some time past Samoan affairs
seem to be made use of by European correspondents
as a subject for experiments in faking, and some of
the results have been as fanciful as anything the yel
low journalism of this country ever did.
The manly, straightforward canvass conducted by
the Republican candidates has merited the favor of
all independent voters who desire to promote the best
interests of the city, and as a result the defection of
such inconsiderate Republicans as may choose to
follow Britton into the Phelan camp will not be so
disastrous to the party as they think. There will be
plenty of independent voters to take their places and
vote the straight ticket for Horace Davis and his
colleagues.
THE LESSON OF THE YACHT RACE.
WHILE most Americans have been content
with the glory of the victory of the Columbia
over the Shamrock, some of the more reflec
tive have noted in it a lesson which will be of value
to us if we are wise enough to profit by it. It is a
simple lesson. The unbroken line of successes in the
yacht races show that we can beat the British in ship
building. Why, then, do we not have a better mer
chant marine than the British?
The New York Tribune in commenting on the sub
ject says: "Why not devote some of that same ability
to achieving supremacy in other directions? Or rather
to restoring the supremacy we once enjoyed? For
before the old America won in pleasure sailing the
primacy the new Columbia has so well maintained
the merchant ships of the United States had won the
primacy of the world for speed and stanchness in that
class. The America was modeled after the clipper,
not the clipper after the America. Our yachting
achievements are outgrowths of our mercantile navi
gation, not the reverse. Is it wise or is it creditable
to the nation to let the branch outgrow the trunk,
or the trunk be shriveled until it is smaller and more
puny than the branch? In brief, if we can build the
best yachts in the world â and if we can build the best
cruisers and battleships, too â why can we not build
the best ocean liners? If we can build Columbias and
lowas, why not Oceanics?"
Following a similar line of argument the Baltimore
American says: "We can build the best ships and
saif them so as to beat anything that Great Britain
can produce, and yet Great Britain's merchant ma
rine, which sixty years ago was less than ours, is
now so much greater as to make ours appear ridicu
lous. This should set both business men and legis
lators to thinking. It is crass folly to be paying from
one hundred and fifty to two hundred millions of dol
lars a year to other countries for carrying our goods
and passengers when every dollar of it might be re
tained in this country. What is the use of being
able to build the best boats if, when we have every
facility for doing it, we go to other countries for all
the boats needed to carry our produce?"
That Is indeed the chief lesson of the race. It Is
an idle vanity to exult in a victory over the British
in a race for sport when they distance us in the vast
competition for the commerce of the ocean. The
marine greatness of a nation is not to be computed
by the triumphs of yachting contests, but by the
mightier triumphs of those huge steamers that carry
on the trade of the nations across the seas. It has
been demonstrated that we can beat the British in
ship-building, but the victory will not be ours until
we hare actually built the ships and set them to work.
DEMOCRATIC DODGING.
SAN FRANCISCO is not the only place in the
Union where the Democrats are trying to i
dodge national questions in the campaign. The i
same attempt is being made in Maryland, and in |
commenting upon it the Baltimore American says:
"It is a queer proposition that the Republican party j
should not discuss national issues because the Demo- '
crats are afraid or ashamed of their own record. We ;
do not imagine that any one who has sufficient intel- j
licence to act independently in politics will be in- j
fiuenced by such rubbish. The independent voter, if j
I he is actuated by principle, desires free and full dis- ;
'. cussion of all matters relating to the public welfare.
He voted against his party in 1895 because of its bad \
j record in State politics, and he did the same thing in
â¢ 1896 because of its very much worse record in na- j
; tional politics and the dire things it threatened if re- !
| stored to power. Has anything occurred since then
to restore confidence in the Democracy? Certainly
not in local matters."
What our contemporary says of conditions in Mary- j
land can be said with equal effectiveness here. The '
record of the Republican party in national affairs is
one to which reference can be made with more than
ordinary satisfaction, for it has changed the hard j
times of Democratic rule into a condition of abound- j
. ing prosperity. Democracy still stands for a national
i policy that brought ruin In the past and will bring
I it again should that party be intrusted with power.
j What has Democracy done in the local politics of San
I Francisco to redeem the national record? Why should
any citizen vote for the party of calamity and class
prejudices in a municipal contest more than in any
other?
The voters of San Francisco are citizens of the
United States. Their local interests are bound up
with those of the nation. When a man goes to the
polls he should cast his vote after a full considera
! tion of every issue affecting the public welfare. A
I victory for Phelan would be vaunted as a Demo
cratic victoryâ a victory for Bryanism. It would
strengthen the forces that are making for the the
! depreciation of the currency of the country and are
trying to arouse class antagonisms and prejudices
among the people.
The Republican party has a record of which it is
proud. Its success mean* prosperity. What has been
accomplished by the Republican majority of the
] present Board of Supervisors shows that in local
as well as in national politics the representatives of
the party can be relied upon to be faithful to their
pledges. The ticket headed by the Hon. Horace
Davis is the best that has ever been nominated in a
municipal contest in this city. Every intelligent citi
zen should feel it a matter of gratification that he
has in this election the privilege of supporting such
worthy candidates for all local offices and at the sa/ne
time standing with the party of prosperity for the
whole nation.
One of the benefits to be derived from a sweeping
Republican victory in this election is that it will
sweep the Non-Partisan fraud into the political gar
bage pile and we shall know it no more.
Phelan's organs may yet object to any criticism
of the action taken by Frank J. Sullivan's Non-
Partisan gang on the ground that it would be a criti
cim of Phelan's family affairs.
Venezuela is in the throes of another revolution.
And writers of farce comedy will insist that the range
of their subjects is rapidly becoming more limited.

POOR NAME FOR
A GOOD FARCE
It la a pity to have a good farce adver
tise Itself by so cheap a title aa "Brown's

Theater was In luck when It booked
Brown for a run during this period of
wouid-be and couldn't-be mirth; but no
one would have guessed that It was worth
a 75-cent seat.
Of all the pleasant breezes that blow
through Â»he" farce Jesale Mac Hall is the
breeziest. 6he 1b as Dresuenesque as
Edna Hopper, and if less pretty she is
more tuneful. She Hlides sinuutnly from
the BWleh of the bicycle to the cuddle of
domesticity, and again she Is partyned
und pink and fluttering.
There Is a friendly lack of staglness In
ell the Informal young people who play
the farce. It is an ideal atmosphere for
a frothy society farce. The complications
uppcur far nure possible than they would
among a widely experienced and brilliantly
prufessiomil parlorful. They are compli
cations that might have given an author
brain fever to guide through their intri
cacies. No such results are apparent,
however, for Mr. Swan has the same
swing about his personality as his writ
ing.
The complications might be laborious if
any one tried to follow them. But who
does? Mark Swan attended to the labor
when ho wrote the play, and the playgo
er?' business Is to be amused. The author
inspires one with confidence in his plot.
It !s much easier to trust him.
Faults? Of course. Mark Swan has
represented types, he has not created
characters. Shakespeare In his youth did
likewise. SARAH COMSTOCK.

ASSUMED NAME â Subscriber. Oat
Hill, Cal. A person who marries under
an assumed name is liable to get him

three years after procuring the license.
If in time the party who assumed the
name wished to right a wrong that per
son would have to obtain a new license
and be married anew. If a man for cer
tain reasons went under an assumed
name, was known as such and desired
to be known as such through life, and
wished to get married it would be proper
to have a court allow him to change his
name and then get a marriage license.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1899.
STEAMER MAULE HAS NOW
BEEN GIVEN UP AS LOST
SHIPPING men have great fears
for the safety of tho little Salva
dorean steamer Maule, which lett
here on September 30 for El TrL
unfo, via San Diego. Nothing has
been heard of her since she passed
through the Golden Gate, In command
of Captain Medena, and her owner has
telegraphed from San Salvador to the
agent here to know what has become
of her. The Maule has not been to San
Diego, and the ocean seems to have
swallowed her up, leaving not a trace
behind.
For a time It was thought the vessel
might have encountered the log raft,
but the big derelict was safe at Port
Harford when the Maule left San
Francisco. There has been no heavy
weather on the southern coast, so the
disappearance of the steamer Is a mys
tery. She came here from Acajutla,
via San Diego, making the run in four
teen days. El *Triunfo Is only about
800 miles further south than Acajutla,
and the Maule is now out thirty-four
days.
The Maul e" 3 cargtj was valued atH
$0755 and was composed of 1450 barrt-lsM
of flour; 100 cases of dynamite; 70-M
cases of coal oil; 10 packages of palntH
and 1 package of arms and ainmuni-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H^^^^^^^l
tion. She is owned by M. Meardl of San Salvador, and yesterday he cabled
L. F. Lastreto of this city to know if he knew anything about the where
abouts of vessel and carg-o. : .â¢-
The Maule was built in ISBS by J. Reid & Co. of Glasgow for the Com
pania sud Americana de Vapores of Valparaiso. She was 204 tons gross and
88 tons net burden, 125 feet 5 inches long and 23 feet 6 Inches beam and 9 feet
deep. About six months ago she was purchased by Mr. Meardl, and this
was her first voyage on his account. ,
Indian Lucy in Court
For the first time sineÂ© the argument
opened "Indian Lucy," who is seeking to
establish her claim as the wife of Capi
talist John R. Hite, was In court yester
day morning- and listened attentively to
the closing analysis of the case by Attor
ney Charles P. Hanlon. Mr. H.anlon'9
argnment followed the lines of a recapitu
lation of the testimony, dwelling on the
alleged statement mace by iTlte in a
Maripiisa ealoon to the effect that ha
would rather have his wife Lucy than
any white girl on earth. mlon also laid
special stress on the allegation that Hite
made his fortune from a mine which was
shown h!m by Indian Lucy and her sis
ter, notwithstanding the attempt of her
people to keep the location or the mine a
secret. At the close of the argument
Judge Jones will take the case under ad
visement.

KODAK MAKERS
BEGIN WAR ON
SMALL DEALERS
Cut Rates on Photo
Supplies.
Tho Eastman Kodak Company has
started a rate war on this coast to force
the smaller retail dealers out of business
to compel some of the larger East
ern manufacturers to enter Into a trust.
The company has sought in more ways
than one to gain absolute control of the
trade. From time to time It has ab
sorbed smaller concerns that threatened
to become competitors for the business of
the amateurs. Some of the concerns re
fused to le absorbed and grew on apcce
until their proportions began to worry
the Eastman people. Some few months
ago propositions were made to these In
stitutions to enter ir'o a combine. Ne
gotiations were evidently not satisfactory
and a compact was not effected.
On this coapt there are more than
twenty thousand amateur photographers,
ar.d they form a very important factor in
the business of the competing Eastern
conipaHos. The Rochester Optical Com
pany, the Rochester Camera and Supply
Company, the Western Camera Company
(the chief rival of the Eastman Com
pany) and tho Adlake Company of Chi
cago have been making frantic bids for
the patronage of the coast These are the
concerns that the Eaetman Company has
been tryinpr to lorce Into a trust
On October 2? ihe trade rwetved notice
irom tiie Kastman Company that a cut of
cne-thlrd in the price of all of the goods
sold by the company would be inaugu
rated on this coast on November 1. The
leading dealers got together Wednesday
iS } a a f ter a lengthy discussion de
cided to abide by the cut and advertise
the reduction on the Eastman goods
1 The result of this is going to be," paid
a prominent dealer yesterday, "that the
smaller dealersâ especially those in the
interior towns who have beon handling
tho goons oi other concernsâ are going to
be frozen out of business by the Eastman
people. This is the greatest rate war In
photographic supplies that has ever been
Inaugurated In the country, and there is
no telling where It la going to end. There
is every Indication that it Is going to >je
a tight to a finish. If the smaller con
corns are able to hold out against the
Eastman peopie a compromise may be
reached after all of them have lost a
great deal of money, but if the aggress
or? win out a trust will undoubtedly be
formed that will force the prices of ama
teur photographic supplies up to a il?r
ure where the pastime will become one of
the greatest luxuries In the country."
The great card of the Eastman people
has been tholr film process of photog
raphy. The dry plate process has given
them considerable uneasiness. They have
bought out several small concerns, but
have been unable to shut off all opposi
tion. The war is inaugurated on this
coast for the reason that Pacific Coast
amatpurs have the reputation among the
manufacturers of using the better qual
ity and a higher price of goods than those
of any other part of the United States.
The war will not affect the larger deal
ers who make a specialty of several lines
of amateur photographic supplies, but
there are more than 400 nmall aealers who
have been selling the goods of the oppo
sition to the Eastman Company which, if
the latter wins out in the war that waa
started yesterday morning, will be forced
out of business.
This is the first time in the history of
amateur photography that a cut in the
prices of the material used has been
dreamed of. The Eastman Company has
had such a monopoly of the business th:*t
on many occasions where dealers have
cut prices their supply has been cut off
entirely and they have been compelled to
retire from that branch of trade.
"Press the button" machines are down
to bedrock prices on the coast since
yesterday, but when the figures go up the
dealers assert that all the losses or the
war will be made good and a great deal
more.
CUBBING A MONSTROUS EVIL.
Alfred P. Black's Ability and Up
rightness Deserves Becognition
by All Good People.
San Francisco has long; been cursed by
ghouls fn human form, who, preying on
the fear of Inexperienced women, havu
placed them In deadly peril by their
wicked acts. Some of these malefactors
were women, and among the number wap
Mrs. Dora Fuhrlg, who was flnallv ar
rested on a charge of murder. The prose
cution of this woman under the law wns
aligned to Alfred P. Black, then, as now
Assistant District Attorney. Against all
the force of mawkish sympathy and false
sentiment Mr. Black contended success
fully and secured a conviction of Mrs
Fuhrig. in consequence of which she was
sentenced to the State prison for a term
of years. She has taken an appeal but
the excellent work of Mr. Black has al
ready borne fruit In the curbing of . in
evil that hitherto wns rampant In thl*
community. Mr. Black is the Republican
nominee for District Attorney. He de
serves and ought to receive the hearty
support of all good citizens. Ho has ex
perience, ability and Integrity.

Ship William Tillie, Drawing Nearly
Twenty Feet, Taken Up Oak-
land Creek â Along
the Front.
The steamer Queen sailed for Puget
Sound yesterday with 365 of the Wash
ington volunteers aboard. There was an
Immense crowd down to Bee the steamer
off and three hearty cheers for the soldier
boys were given as the Queen moved
away from the wharf. The Queen carried
troops only and all the arrangements for
her charter and the dispatch of the men
were made by Levl N. Ankenny of Walla
Walla. Wash. The transport Leelanaw
got away early yesterday morning for
Manila via Honolulu, with 275 head of
horses. The Conemaugh, with 280 horses,
will go this morning.
ThÂ« transport Hancock camÂ© oft the
Hunters Point drydock yesterday and
went to the Union Iron Works to put off
a lot of gear and plglron. She was to
have had her trial trip yesterday, but the
putting on of her bilge keels was not
completed In time. She will be ready by
Monday and during the afternoon her
compasses will be adjusted and she will
have a trial spin around the bay.
The American ship Cyrus Wakefteld is
now out 120 days from Port Stanley, Falk
lands Islands, for San Francisco and ten
per cent reinsurance is being paid, on
her. The Wakefield was cnutrht in a
storm off the Horn, during which Cap
tain Henry was either killed or murdered.
The vessel then put into Stanley and while
she was there the ship John R. Kelley
was wrecked while making port and Cnp
taln Chapman took command of the Wake
field. That was four months ago and
since then nothing has been heard of the
vessel. The general fmpression is that
Captain Chapman, finding it impossible
to round the Horn, squared away and Is
! coming via the Cape or Good Hope.
The British ship William Tillie, drawing
nlnetÂ»-^n feet *ix Inches of water, went
up Oakland Creek to discharge yesterday.
j Since the estuary has been dredged near
â  ly all classes or vessels can go up and
i down the creek with safety. Captain Silo-
I v!ch. in the tug Alert, had no difficulty in
taking the big Britisher up to th^ coal
bunkers, where her cargo is to be dis
charged.
The longshoremen along the front made
a demand yesterday for 40 cents an hour
on all work and got It. The rate used to
be 20 cents an hour and one or two iso
lated strikes for an advance of 10 cents
were successful. From this on the pay
will be 40 cents an hour on all work.
Tim Larkln-of 630 Sacramento street
was treated yesterday at the Harbor Hos-
Sital for a badly lacered scalp wound.
:efore Officer Henneberry could get the
man to the hospital he nearly bled to
I death. Larkln Bays he was held up by
two men en the corner of East street and
j Broadway, who robbed him of $30 and then
knocked him down with a club.
Denis Hughes severed an artery be

MAY COME TO THE COAST.
Interstate Commerce Commission May
Adjourn to Take Testimony in
This City.
The Inclinations are that the meeting of
the Interstate Commerce Commission in
St. Louis on the 13th inst. will be lartjely
attended. It is believed that the St. Louis
hearing: will be only preliminary and that
the sessions will not extend over three or
four days. The reason for this is that the
interests of the coast are so large that
more time Is needed for preparation than
has been afforded In the Interval between
the filing of the suit by the St. Louis
lobbers and the date set for the hearing.
It will also be asked, so that the Paeinc
Coast may have ample opportunity to get
In all the facts, that further testimony
shall be taken upon the coast, either by
a member of the commission delegated
for that duty or by the entire commission.
Charles F. Tay, who Is joins East upon
other business, will be one of the wit
nesses for the coast at the St. Louis hear
ing. J. Baruoh will go a? a witness from
Los Angeles and J. S. Goldsmith will tes-

DEVOTEES OF
FOOTBALL ARE
MORE ARDENT
New Schedule Promises Good
Matches Between West
ern Colleges.
WHEN the preparatory work of this
Lson was under way the football
prospects for the year were never
before bo glowing nor .so bright. Hardly
had the games begun when a slump
changed all the glittering premises into
the most mediocre football possible.
A week ago the football atmosphere
was not inspiriting, but the unexpected
has happened and it now looks as if the
month of November would bring with it
some interesting gridiron sport. Arrange
: ments have been made for contests be
. tween the two California universities and
the rival colleges of Washington, Oregon
' and Nevada. The new schedule of games
contains a series of matches which will
run through the present month and wll,
on account of their number, allow of con
tests In this city and at either of the
university lields every Saturday. There Is
, a possibility of the non-appearance of the
teams representing Oregon and Washing
ton, but che University of Nevada eleven
will certainly make the trip, although it
has been delayed a week on account of
â  faculty opposition.
Stanford and the Olympics will meet
this afternoon for the third time this sea
son. They will play again on Tuesday â
election Jayâ at Palo Alto. The students
! of the University of California were pre
; paring for a reception of the Nevada
boys, but on Tuesday last a telegram was
received from Reno which called off the
game scheduled for this afternoon on the
Berkeley Held. Ever since 1596, when the
custom of sending the freshmen elevens
of the universities of the State to Reno
was inaugurated, Nevada and California
have been more or less in touch in foot
', ball matters. Hitherto the local fresh
! man elevens have found no great difficul
ty in taking the measure of the Nevadans,
but conditions are not as they were. Ne
vada's team of 1899 Is a stronger and bet
ter drilled aggregation than in former
years. It is not, however, up to our col-
I legiate standard in the game and there
I can be no doubt as to the outcome of the
: matches.
Stanford will meet . the University of
j Nevada team next Saturday on the Palo
Alto gridiron. The week following will see
! a match between the University of Cali
i fornia and the University of Nevada.
These games will serve as good practice
I for the college elevens, as they present a
different team against which to battle.
The college men of Stanford and the Uni
versity of California have played against
the Olympic team so often that they know
thoroughly the style of play affected by
the clubmen. This new team will force
; a change in tactics and be a good lesson
to the big college elevens of this State.
Will the Olympics win a game this sea
-1 son? That is the question which those In
terested in football are repeatedly asking
at the club, and the answer is anything
but comforting. After a week of complete
i rest the Olympic eleven has returned to
j its peculiar system of practice. The red
I and white team which will line up this
afternoon ib practically the same that
played Stanford two weeks ago, with the
] exception of Fickert, whose place will be
filled by Atkinson. Fickert strained his
shoulder during the week and Is on the
shelf temporarily.
Less than four weeks remain In which
the college teams may perfect their play
i ing and form their Thanksgiving day
teams. Progress so far has been uniform
and the prospects of a hard-fought cham
, pionship contest are brighter than herto
' fore. There is plenty of spirit at Palo
Alto and with heavier material a strong
! team should be the outcome of Chamber
lain's efforts. As it is, California will iind
an organized team pitted against It on
November 30..- â¢. ; .% ,\'
The coaches at California, Cochran and
Kelly, are not enthusiastic over the work
on the California campus. They have
been trying their best to break down the
unwarranted- spirit of overconfidence the
California men seem to exhibit on all oc
casions. â  The games between that eleven
and the Olympics have not displayed any
great superiority of playing on the part
of the California eleven. It has not come
up to the anticipated standard. ' Cochran
and Kelly do not neglect a moment, yet
the eleven is by no means what It should
be for a team .that has been playing to
gether for two seasons. Whlpple has not
- yet been able to rojoln the eleven, of
which he is captain, but it is expected he
, will be In the ranks next week. The seri
; ous part of the work has begun and in
, difference will not be tolerated during the
remainder of the season.
STANFORD MEN HOPEFUL.

Saturday put new zest into football at

CHAMPIONSHIP CONTESTS
AMONG CLEVER GOLFERS
VICE CAPTAIN P. K. BOWLES of the Oakland Golf Club
an l 11. B. Goodwin, representing the San Francisco golfers,
have been discussing the preliminaries of the series of
home and home mutches to be held between teams of the two
dubs. Owing to the numerous events for which dates have
..'ready fixed the first of these matches will probably take
place early in January, and will consist of two parts, one on
the Oakland links and the other on the Presidio course. A sec
ond and similar double-barreled contest will take place In April.
In the event of a tie the deciding match will be played in May
on neutral links.
This afternoon on the Presidio links there will be an eight
een-hole tournament against "bogey." who will probably give
the s( ratch men a handicap of a stroke on each hole, other
players receiving handicaps proportioned to the results of their
â¢ play. The scratch men will thus have some chance of
winning the tournament. If. as is likely, there are some ties,
they will be played off later.
Next Saturday. November 11. the ladies of the Ban Fran
cisco Golf Club will probably have a handicap tournament over
eighteen holes, medal play. There will be ilrsi ami second prizes,
and the winner of the liret prize will aJso Ix-corne the holder of
the VV'lnslow medal, which is supposed to be contended for once
a month among the ladies. The Winslow medal must be won
three times before becoming the winner's property, it lias
already been won by Miss M. B. Hough ton, Miss E. W. Morgan.
Mis.* Taylor and Miss Sarah Drum. Miss Houghton has won it
twice â in February and in March of this year.
Later in the month the quallfyingrouiids for the tournament
for the Council's cup will be held over eighteen holes, medal
piay. The eight or sixteen players who make the lowesi -
in the qualifying round will enter the cup tournament, which
will be at nmtcn play. The ladies of the San Francisco club
also wish to have a handicap match tournament in December
under Eimilar conditions to those for the Council's cup. The
competitions for the Council's cup will take place on Thanks
giving day New Tear's day and Washington's birthday, the
qualifying rounds to be. played within the two weeks preceding
each competition.
The second tournament for the Macdmiald cupwill takeplace
this afternoon on the Oakland links. It Is an eighteen-hole
match play, handicap contest, for men. In the first contest,
which began September 2. C. P. Hubbard defeated K. P.. Folger
in the tinal round.
In the fourth fortnightly tournament held on the links at San
â¢ the sight is encouraging. It means the '
Stanford team this year will be composed
i of the most determined set of men that
j ever represented the cardinal. Nor will
they have to depend on "spirit" alone.
Among those who appear each evening
for practice are men of first class foot
ball abilityâ of action, weight and experi
ence.
The line men continue to improve with
I each day's practice, particularly in their
offensive work. Graves, Bentley, De For
est and Huston leading, with Dole, Emer
! son and Wrigiey not far behind. Raitt,
, the quarterback of the victorious fresh
; man team, is being tried at end and Is
playing a good game.*
Two weeks ago the situation back of the
line was serious. It now begins to look
as if the backs will at least be up to the
i average of the rest of the team. The
- most hopeful change has been placing the
younger McFadden at fullback. While
i the position is new to him, he has shown
wonderful promise. His line bucking is
the best that has been seen here since
Stewart Cotton retired from the game.
He is also good In running, interference
and backing up the line. Smith and
' Fisher at halves are doing creditable
| work, playing together and putting up
; good Interference. It is probable that
these three men will be seen in to-mor-
I row's game, when Stanford lines up
i against the Olympics. Erb, Nourse and
! Jost on the second eleven understand
their positions well and will be in tho
! race till the end. Only one Injury has
J been sustained BO far, Phil Oilman, guard
! on the second eleven, receiving a painful
; but not serious wrench in his knee. Bur
i nett is back in the game after a week's
rest, much improved in condition. The
health of the whole squad continues good
! under the care of Trainer Murphy.
Most of the men in the freshman team
continue to come out, and several have
good prospects for the big eleven. The
i line-up for Saturday's game will be much
the same as It has been In the former
games, except back of the line. Many
1 men will be substituted as the game pro
gresses In order that the "trying out"
system may go on steadily.
ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL.
The team of apprentices from British
ships which was defeated last Saturday
afternoon by the Vampire Association
football eleven will try conclusions again
i to-day with the victors on the Presidio
j athletic grounds. The sailors were some
| what unlucky last Saturday, two of their
tries at goal passing over the crossbar.
As their team has been somewhat
i strengthened, they hope to make a bet
-1 ter display to-day. The team will be or

LOCAL SERIES
Fans Are Expecting Close
Games Between the Rival
Baseball Teams.
THE Sacramento ball team is sched
uled for two more trips to this city
before the end of the season. They
are coming this week for a bout with the
Oaklands and will wind up a series of
five games at Recreation Park to-morrow
afternoon. Contests between these two
teams are always full of snap, and In
view of the unfortunate ending of the
game between them last week at Sacra
mento there should be some warm ball
playing when they meet. again. Umpire
O'Connell is blamed for the defeat of the
Dudes last Sunday, but the Dudes de
serve censure for sulking and leaving the
diamond in the ninth inning, when the
score was tie. The decision which they
disputed did not determine the game and
they might have won despite it. In caus
ing the game to be forfeited they gave
the Senators a lead that will carry the
pennant with it. Manager Ewing has
not given up hope of winning a majority
of the series.
The line-up for to-morrow's game is as

eight y-riog stake.
Sail Mateo Coursing Park will make a
fresh start this afternoon in Its bidding
for public patronage. John Grace Jr. will
resume the duties and responsibilities of

himself creditably, as he is thoroughly
informed as to the requirements of the
position and enjoys the confidence of the
coursing fraternity.
Will Thompson will have two new per

Club, assisted by K. C. Stenberg and a
committee of ten; the reception commit
tee consisted of thirteen, with E. Bailey
as chairman; and the committee of ar
rangements of five members, E. P. Mr-
Donough being chairman. The members
and many friends of the club enjoyed a
pleasant evening.
The entertainment and races that were
to have taken place at the home of the
Dolphin Boating Club to-morrow have
been deferred on account of the death of
one of the members. When the next
meeting of the club is held, a date will h-.'
set for the third race for the diamond
medal, which has been already won twice
by George Baker. If he wins it a third
time it will become his property. Gri
Baker is much disappointed over h:
ure to last the distance in the champion-
Bhip race at El Campo, but he had a heav
ier boat than his competitors and
fast pace to the turn. Papp used the skiff
belonging to the Triton Club, which Id i
light and fast craft, and Dr. Dennis had
a good boat. Baker was somewhat over
rained, and so not capable of his best.
Pape intends to take up shell rowing next
season.
There i*s not much going on round ;he
city boat houses now, but over at Oakland
last Sunday the Alamedas had a barge
I crew out, and several of the members of
i the University of California took some
practice on the creek. S. J. Pembroke
has on two occasions coached a Univer-
I slty boy named Klngman, who was at one
time champion wrestler of the Olympic
! Club. Though he is inexperienced in row

I left college. Kingman will work for a
place In the University four. But rowing
will excite comparatively little interest at
Berkeley until the sport is taken up at
Palo Alto, and there are prospects of an
intercollegiate barge contest. President
Wheeler recently spoke highly of rowing
as an exercise and a sport, and it is to be
hoped his words will produce good effects
in the future.
The Olympic Club directors have under
consideration a plan for acquiring ground
at Alameda and erecting thereon a boat
house, adjacent to which would bo a run
ning and cycling track, lawn tennis courts
and appliances for many outdoor sports.
If this plan is successfully carried cut.
there Is no doubt that rowing will receive
a great impetus, and that the Columbia
Rowing Club and the boating association
of the University of California will tak.<
it up with fresh vigor and interest. The
rowing of the Olympic Club has hitherto
awakened little enthusiasm on account of
{ the inaccessibility of the boat house. The
Olympic Club proposes to have its four
oared shell fitted into the tank at the
club house, so that it can be used for
practice. It is intended to arrange it in
such a way that It will be rigid but capa
ble of being removed when the tank is
wanted for water polo or other aquatic
sports. The blades of the oars will have
holes through which the water may pa^s
when the stroke is pulled, offering enough
resistance to furnish good exercise.
The last of the southern series, young
bird series, of the California Homing

MANY EAGER RIVALS
Eastern Poker Crooks Are Being
Imported to the City.
The Authorities Are Doing Nothing to Pre
vent a Threatened Winter Carnival
of Gambling.
j^y ONSTBRNATION has entered the
I ranks of local gamblers. The pros
i pects of a winter's profits have
I, been shattered by The Call's expose
of the gambling den on Mason
street* Other establishments in dif
ferent parts of the town have been
threatened and the sure-thing fraternity
ip bewailing the publicity of facts which
will seriously Interfere with the scheme
to make San Francisco a wide-open town.
There Is very little question that a detp
lnld and widely ramifying plot has been
laid to throw the city open this winter to
the ramblers. The Eastern contingent
has already ai rived. They have money
and the cleverness of crooks. One of the
race tracks is in operation and the other
will open to-day.
San Francisco is naturally the bead
quarters for the gamblers and never be
fore In its history has the city presented
a more inviting prospect for gamblers. A
good deal of money is in circulation
Scores of unwary miners have come
money laden from the Northern gold
Holds. Thousands of eoldiers represent a
great mass of wealth in the aggregate,
and horsemen would not be here if they
were not ready to spend easily money
easily won. It is very evident, therefore,
that the city presents for the gamesters
ah inviting held.
For some time there has been very little
agitation against the gamblers. They
have been quiet and the police very ac
commodatingly have left them alone. It
was during this spell of apparent Inac
tivity that the scheme to throw the city
open to the gamblers was hatched. Time
and again efforts have been made,
through the support, indorsement and en
couragement of Dan Burns, Mose Gunst
and others, to give the city over to the
gamblers and Eastern crooks. Gunst was
formally accused of doing so and for
awhile the attempt was abandoned, j Now
It has been renewed with more than ordi
nary energy and with more than the
former prospect of success for the men
who would bring crime as an agent of
the law into the city's life.
â¢ It was natural that a man such as Joe
Harvey should take the initiative. He
enjoys the friendship of the police author
ities* particularly of Chief of Police Lees.
The gambling fraternity know Harvey
and it was to bo expected that he would
receive encouragement. The police know
thru Harvey's "club" is organized solely
to cheat the laws and to legalize a crime.

ATTORNEY PINTO'S PLAINT.
He Must Either Quit His Home or
Get Rid of His Brothers-in-

Julian Pinto, attorney at 1538 Market
street, is having considerable trouble with
his wife's relatives. About a year ago
his mother-in-law was arrested for shoot

charge.
Yesterday Pinto secured a warrant from
Judge Megan for the arrest of his
brother-in-law, Timothy Little, on the
charge of disturbing the peace. Little
was arrested and was released on giving
$20 cash bail.
Pinto complained to the Judge that he
was compelled to support his three

his wife to join in their hilarious gather

action to set aside a deed of conveyance
whereby Harry Sherwood transferred his
interest in the Sherwood estate to his
brother, A\i!llam Sherwood, a fÂ«w mnrrtns

RED RUBBER STAMPS
FOR PHELAN VOTERS
Rainey Plans Campaign of Dol
lars to Close Mayor's Fight.
Contracts With a Local Firm for Stamps
Which Wiil Serve to Identify His
Purchased Partisans.-
ON Thursday of the present week
The Call received Information
from a source which it never had
reason to doubt that the disrep
utable gang with which James D.
Phelan has associated himself In the
present campaign had sounded the signal
for the opening of the sack and were
planning a wholesale cash purchase of all
of those good Democratic votes which the
Phelan-Rainey influence could not swing
Into line. Close in touch as The Call has
kept with the course of Mr. Phelan and
his allies through the present campaign,
it has expected nothing more than the
misrepresentations and personal abuse
which have characterized the dally
mouthlngs of the oratorical timber of the
Phelan supporters. That the henchmen
of the Mayor would under existing cir
cumstances care or dare to attempt to
defeat the letter and spirit of the Aus
tralian ballot act by the use of money
copiously spent was not at first credited,
notwithstanding the excellence and infal
libility of The Call's authority. Of a con
sequence, a searching inquiry was at once
begun, amd of the mass of evidence gath
ered there is everything to prove and
nothing to disprove the allegations first
made. That the Bush-street adherents
of Mayor Phelan have planned a "dollar
Hmit" campnign among the hundreds of
touts and hirelings who place a meal
ticket as the maximum price of their
support Is beyond the peradventure of a
doubt That the heads <>f the Democratic?
ticket have pooled their issues and re
sources Is equally evident.
The plan as outlinedâ and later provedâ
contemplated no restoration of the good
old times when those who followed In the
wakes of the bosses voted early and often
and got their price every time they did it.
Each man was to have the price of his
vote, but he was to vote hut once. That
once, however, he was to cast the ballot
he was paid for, and would be supplied
before he entered the booth with th<>
rubber stamps to mark It, and would be
closely watched, until he had dune so.
The virtue of the scheme lay in the
stamp. Notwithstanding the city pro-

DUFFY MALT WHISKEY CO., Rochester, N. Y.
I vldes a marker with every voting booth,
1 Mr. Ralney went the city onÂ© better and
I contracted for a lot that would mark an
! ordinary Btralght Democratic ticket In
j le6s than one-third the time It takea with
[ the ordinary stamp. One Impression of
; Mr. Rainey's Invention, In fact, would
I leave crosses nicely placed opposite the
names of all of the. candidates nt the head
of the Phelan ticket. Under his scheme
a mistake in marking was Impossible, but
It served a better purpose still, In that It
made possible the system of espionage
over purchased voters that had been
j planned by the gang. On the day of elec
tion the hirelings were to report In Incon
spicuous bunches to one or another of
! the lieutenants of the Bush street boss,
who were to be stationed at the booths
of the different precincts. There they
would be provided with Mr. Rainey's
combination stamp and sent behind the
curtain. If it took them an unduo time
to mark their ballot Rainey's henchman
on the outside would know at onco that
his man had not kept faith with his mas
ters and the combination would save the
Price at the cost of a vote.
Mr. Rainey's little ready marker, how
ever, made no provision for Supervisors
or Police Judges. The little fellows on
the ticket were left to shift for them
selves; the pooled resources of the com
bination were to be spent solely upon
themselves, and the purchased tout v\is
left at liberty to vote for the others or
not, as he liked That this fact was so
and that many others are equally true
was again demonstrated yesterday by a
visit to the red rubber stamp factory of
Moise & Klinkner, at 820 Sansome street.
A Call representative called at that estab
lishment yesterday afternoon to open
negotiations for a thousand or so of the
stamps as they had been described, and
after a simple description, which preceded
j a half hour's conversation with the oblig
ing head of the department, that official
came out with the startling information
that he knew Just what was wanted.
"We make them every year for the
gang," said he, "and have turned cut
another bunch lately. I'll show you
one." And diving into the workroom in
the rear he reappeared in a moment with
a stamp identical with that first bhown
The CalL
"Anybody can stamp a ticket with one
of these," he continued, "and stamp It
the way you want him to." Ami by way
of illustration he blocked out a line of
! little red crossesopposlte the names at the
; head of the Democratic column on the
1 sample ballot that was handed him in as
i little time as It takes to vote the head of
! the ticket with the ordinary honest
j stamp.
"We sell those at 10 cents each in thou
; sand lots," continued he "or for liy* cents
ton live hundred. I did not think" there
j would be any further call for them this
| s^fsion, but I ffuesa we can get out an
, other thousand for you by Monday noon."
Whether Rainey's little marker and the
j cash that goes with it will prove potent
on election day depends upon the value
of publicity. At uny rate the Registrar
has been for some days informed of the
scheme, and Mr. Steppacher Is not stand-
Ing for any infraction of the election laws
when he can help it.

JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE.
Saloon-Keeper Dodge Acted in Self- !
Defense When He Shot
Sailor Hall.
Evidence taken yesterday at the Coro
ner's inquest upon the body of Charles
Hall, who was shot and killed last Tuts- I
day night by C. R. Dodge in the latter s j
saloon. No. 214 Fifth avenue, South San '
i Francisco, convinced the jury that old '
1 man Dodge had fired the shot In self-dÂ»
--; fense. They found a verdict accordingly
j that the homicide was justifiable.
The deceased, as well as his eight com
panions, were members of the crew of the
Steamer Hancock. They had several
rounds of drinks in the saloon, and a dis
pute arose between Dodge and the men
regarding the payment of a round or
dered by one of the sailors named Marr
Dodge refused to serve any more liquor
and the gang attacked Dodge and his son
i The son was knocked down with a chair
by one of the men. and both father and
I son were roughly handled and beaten by
the sang.
Thomas Grant, one of the witnesses ad
-1 mitted that he had struck old man Dodge
j a "soft blow" in the body, to defend hirn
i self from an attack of the old m.-in
; Jamieson, another of the crew, was read
ing a newspaper at the counter, and when
the quarrel began he laid down the paper
and struck C. H. Dodge and his son.
"All the buys from the ship took a hard
iln the right and were striking DodVe
! Young Dodge, was knocked down," con
tinued Grant, "Jnmieson and I were the
I last to leave the saloon before the two
phots were tired. Hall, the'deceased was!
in the tight also, and I could not swear I
positively that he did not strike Dodge "

IV. THE HOME FURNISHING.
Decoration necessarily precedes fur
nishing, but the underlying laws of both
nre practically the same. The woman
who can make a nerfect scheme of deco
ration for each room Is not in the lffi-'t
likely to blunder when she buys the fur
niture for it. The difficulty will be to find
in any manufactory the thing she has
learned to desire. In any buying, how
ever, what we get has to be modified by
many considerations. The mother of a
family of*growing boys, for instance, does
not lay in a stock of spider-legged tables
and Insect chairsâ those things that creak
when we sit down and fall over when we
get up.
Here, as elsewhere, in our education,
we have to contend with inherited half
sight, as it were. That is, a thing may
seem beautiful that on consideration we
know not to be. Our national taste Is Im
proving, but is not yet perfected and we
need much honest study before we can
recognize at once what makes beauty.
That a given object conveys pleasure to
the eye is not a safe rule, yet we have our
excuse since the African admires abnorm
ally fat women, the Chinese prefer de
formed feet and civilized races deformed
waists. What we want and must learn
to demand from the maker are grace and
power in the lines of the thing made, fine
material, perfect finish and true decora
tion. And not one of these things is to
interfere at any point with the comfort
able use of the article in question.
What Not to Do.
The background for all furniture comes
under the head of decoration, and th?n
follow three other pointsâ the size of the
room in which the object is to be placed,
the purpose of the room, and the object
or use of the articles themselves. With
these are included the nature of the ma
terials to be used, mineral, animal or
vegetable, and their relative lasting qual
ity or destructibility. With this thought
in mind and its points really settled, the
young housekeeper !s not likely to experi
ment with soap boxes and barrels, follow
ing popular directions for making all the
furniture at home. To a certain extent,
in summer furnishing of seaside cottages,
this is not impossible. But there was an
era of cheesecloth and red flannel; the
first used for curtains, the second for
covers to soap boxes and for barrel chairs,
etc., which meant a few days of effective
ness and a long space for repentance. It
is hardly likely to come again. The
hygienic bedroom, for instance, banished
at once all draperies and the many dust
collecting arrangements we have come to
think of as essential. But the money
spent on these can well enter into better
linish, a finer order of plumbing, etc. And
there is a whole system of ornament that
the slightest gain in real knowledge of art
in furnishing banishes forever. With
this knowledge a common possession, we
shall not be likely to see any more minia
ture coal scuttles doing duty as salt cel
lars, or wheelbarrows and slippers hold
ing flower . This applies also to the In
numerable Christmas productions, tawdry
bits of glass and china and metal, cheaper
year by year, and destructive to any real
art sense. "Now nothing made by man's
hand can be indifferent, but must be either
beautiful and elevating or ugly and de
grading." This was William Morris' sum
mary of the matter, and to remember this
in buying will help us all.
Construction and Its Meaning.
To illustrate this we may take the con
struction of a perfect chair. And to fix
the idea of what "perfect" may stand for
we may better turn to Ruskin's definition
of ornament in either decoration or fur
nishing. "The true form of conventional
ornament consists in bestowing as much
beauty on the object as shall be consis
tent with its material, its place and its
office." Beauty and poor construction are
incompatible, and thus we are forced to
judge our chair by a new standard. Each
part of it should be as thoroughly united
to the next as if it had grown in its place.
The Greeks and Romans understood this,
and their chairs in the British Museum
are as perfect as if made yesterday. This
means well-seasoned wood, exactly cut
tenons and mortises, very hot glue of the
best quality and the right degree of pres.
sure in putting them together. Lightness
for ease in handling is another essential.
If carving is employed it should be abso
lutely subordinate to the outline and the
comfort of the sitter. The dress must not
be interfered with nor must there be
chance of breakage from exposed orna
ments or too salient points. These laws
apply equally to couches, beds and tables,
and fortunately furniture manufacturers
are learning them, in degree, at least.
Children's Furniture.
With our habit of thinking of the child
as a miniature man or woman, it seMom
occurs to us to provide any special furni
ture after the days of the high chair nnd
cradle are over. Yet the child whom we
perpetually warn off the ground of our
own possessions is purely entitled to his
own. We are very apt to turn our houses
into museums and are astonished that the
child does damage in them. For this rea
son, If no other, it would be well to In
sure the child his own place, and It is now
quite possible to provide for him the fur
niture made especially for children's use,
from the little enameled beds in iron or
brasÃâ the most rational form of bedâ to
the small bureaus, tables, chairs and
other fittings that go with them.
The Sum of the Whole Matter.
TJ?ts of the absolutely necessary arti
cles at furniture for a small house or riat
are now kept by many furniture dealers
and are also found in household maga
zines and newspapers which have a de
partment of the home. The type of fur
nishing must vary with the purse, but the
simplest home, if taste and understanding
have worked together, can carry an at
mosphere of repose and harmony that is
the most essential feature of the home.
For any house, great or small, we want
beds that are not too finely decorated to
lie upon; chairs that are not too frail to
sit on; tables that are not too shaky and
uncertain for comfortable writing or
drawing. All over-ornamentation must
be' put away. In our own private rooms,
usually a bedroom for each, we may work
our will, though even here, as before
mentioned, hygiene has already set the
limits of adornment. But the family
room should mean full and comfortable
working space, and Morris long ago, in
his "Lectures on Art," laid down the law
which, with modifications here and there,
Is still worth obeying:
"What the sitting-room of a healthy
person should hold is. first, a bookcase
with a great many books In it; next, a
table that will keep steady when you
write or work at it; then several chairs
that you can move and a couch that you
can sit or lie upon; next a cupboard with
drawers; next, unless the (jupboard or
bookcase be very beautiful with painting
or carving, you will want pictures or en
gravings such as you can affordâ only not
stop-gaps, but real works of art on the
wallâ or else the -wall Itself must be or
namented with some beautiful, restful
pattern; we shall also want a vase or two,
to put floweps in, which latter you must
have sometimes, especially if you live in
a town; Then there will be the fireplace,
of course, which In our climate is bound
to be the chief object in the room. That
is all we shall want, especially if the floor
be good; if it be not. as. by the way in a
modern house it is pretty certain not to
be. I admit that a small carpet which can
be bundled cut of the room in two min
utes will be useful, and we must also
take care that it is beautiful or it will
annoy us terribly."

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN" A.
HOUSE AND A HOME.
The building of a house is of no conse
quence whatever, but the building of a
home is something to be thought of-*
thoroughly discussed and planned for a
long time. The building of homes on
paper, for at least one year before at
tempting to develop them in more lasting
material, Is recommended. These homes
have splendid qualitiesâ there are no
mason's or carpenter's contracts to be
made, no plumber's bill to be vexed over,
the furnace never smokes nor the water
pipes freeze. If you have regrets over the
mistakes of your plan they are easily re
modeled, and with practice you are get
ting many valuable ideas as to the possi
bilities of the modernly constructed
American home. It goes without saying
that the best plan is to know as nearly
as possible the cost of the house one can
afford to build and the real needs of those
who are to occupy it.
Having chosen a healthful location and
looked wen to the drainage and immedi
ate surroundings, the first thing to be
considered is our variable climate. â  Here
is thf> first dilemma. We go from "Green
land's icy mountains to India's coral
strand" every twvlve months, and it
really is a desperate matter to build one
small house so as to be perfectly com
fortable during each extreme. Fortun
ately, the thick walls, which keep out the
cold, also keep out the heat, and it will
not be many years before some long
suffering woman will design windows
which will keep out the dust as well.
An ideal home for the average family of
five will cluster round a center chimney.
There will be a generous reception room
with an open fireplace, an oaken stairway
that will represent both beauty and ease,
whose steps shall have only a four-inch,
lift and a ten-inch tread, with a landing
at each four feet of rise, on which shall
be a broad cushioned seat. The library,
living-room and chambers will be on .ha
south, the dining-room back of the recep
tion-room. Beyond the dining-room will
be a domestic laboratory, two sides of
glass, answering the double purpose of
iight and ventilation, for in this model
home domestic science will he understood,
and the room where the food is ; repared.
will be carefully ventilated and chemically
clean, as air, either pure or impure, is
beaten or cooked into all the food a fam
ily consumes.
The bathroom will be fitted with the
most approved sanitary plumoing and
supplied with soft water, the woodwork
the best of its kind, perfectly plain, with
out groove or joint, to catch the dust and
breed disease germs. In fact, this ideal
home will be severely plain and simple
both as to finish and furnishing.
There will be hardwood floors and an
abundance of closets and storerooms,
which will have windows for ventilation
as well as for light. Porches and piazzas
wherever possible. Then, believing with.
Samantha Allen, "you may build a fine
house and put people of the same namo
to live in it, but if love don't board with
them they'd be as well off with a stump
and an umbrella," I'd furnish this model
home, along with its built-in hall and win
dow seats, its book shelves and sideboard
recesses, its china closets and dining-room
cabinets, with an ocean of love for w.j
another, which would create che t'-ua
home atmosphere.
The importance of the home In the
scheme of civilization never received so
much attention as it does to-day, and
every beautifully designed house helps
along toward the higher plane of living
for which we are all striving.

activity by thp various pools was apparent in
the stocks which have ailvanced within the
last few days. Heavy realizing was in evi
dence at a very early period in the trading
ami the snap was soon taken out of the up
ward movement. The volume of the Felling;
was much reduced below the best prices, but
the demand also fell off and support seemed
to be withdrawn from the manipulators"
ppecialties. The course of prices was generally
downward for the rest of the day. One or
two efforts were made to check the decline,
but without great effect. Th" bears made no
great demonstration until the final hour, when
prices touched the low point of the day. Cov
'erlng by the shorts rallied prices, but they
â were not well held and the closing was rather
heavy and dull. The general level of prices
is lower on the day, but there are a few ex
ceptions. United States Leather continued a
conspicuous figure in the speculation and was
rushed up an extreme 5Vt points to 2i% and
clpsed % below that. The preferred stock
parted company with its Junior after a rise
of nearly a point, and was decidedly weak for
the rest of the day, declining an extreme 3%,
â with a final rally of %. Dealings In Southern
Pacific continued on a very large scale., but
the stock at no time rose more than â¢*** above
last nicht's level. .Sugar dropped a point, ral
lied 2 and fill again below last night's level,
ilunhattan, on the contrary, rose a point, but
fell again (â > 111 and rallied but teebly. Mand
ard Hope opened up ?* and then turned down
ward an extreme 2-V Brooklyn Transit also
developed weakness early in the day and went
below SS at one time. In the lirst live min
utes of trading over 11,000 shares of Chesa
peake and Ohio came on the market with only
a slight impression on the price. These ex
amples indicate the prevalent disposition to
take profits for the long account. The ma
jority of railroad stocks were singularly neg
lected with the exception of some early de
mand for the Southwest which gave way
in the late weakness. During the first two
hours of trading there were but two transac
tions recorded in .St. Paul. There was BOUM
â ellln â  for London account, but It was well
absorbed during the early period of strength
In this market. The reactionary tendency was
tin- to the growing apprehension of un un
favorable bank statement to-morrow. Money
was not stringent, but was firm at 6 to <- per
cent. The banks have lost on sub-treasury
operations some $2,081,000 after allowing for
receipts of $1,000,00 in gold and Government
interest payments and Including $3W,000 de
posited at the sub-treasury for transfer to the
interior. According to statements compiled by
the leading banks they have made net ship
ments to the Interior by express of nearly
$2,000,000. This would indicate a net loss to
the best banks in cash of over M. 900,000. The
clearing-house institutions ha â  â â  called loans
on a large scale during the week, so that this
loss in cash is offset, in part at least. Last
Saturday's statement was believed tt have
made a more favorable showing than was
warranted by the actual condition of the banks
and the vagaries of the average f-ystim may
throw some of the unfavorable factors oxer
Into this week's statement.

Bradstreet's Financial Review.
NEW YORK. Nov. 3.â Bradstreet's review of
: the New York stock market will pay to-mor
row:
i Speculation has been more active . and the
stock market was in the main strone and ad
i vancing. a decided rise in money rates due to
the effect of the November disbursements on
the deleted New York hank reserves- only
| created a slight halt In thf market's progress
with Irregular concessions in stocks subjected
to bearish attack. When the money market be
came somewhat easier, as it did by Wednes
day, the upward movement was resumed and
strong support was displayed In different por
"tions of the list. The trading, however has
â  continued to be largely profitable, and the bull
ish and confident line which the street has
shown baa attracted only a moderate amount
iof outside buying. The London market experi
enced a shock early in the week on hearing of ,
j the mishap of the British force in Natal, and
! on Tuesday especially there was considerable
selling in this market, which contributed the
! Irregular lines In the early part of the week
; The Transvaal war and the foreign financial
; situation generally have been, watched but
| the fact that the London money market con
j tinues to be easy, and that speculative inter
ests there show confidence In the speedy ter
; mination of the war after the full British force
1 arrives at the Cape tend to allay apprehension
on that SCpre. The rise in the money market
here was regarded as a much more serious mat
ter for speculation. The contraction of loans
falls, of course, mainly on the stock market,
and some authorities arirue from the intense
activity of trade and the failure of money to
return from the Interior that the contraction
I will continue for some time. The rise of call
j loan rates on Monday and Tuesday to 20 per
i cent, with some incidental, higher quotations,
was due, however, to an unusual amount of
disturbance of balances, caused by the No
vember 1 Interest, dividend and other pay
ments. But these figures generally, as lenders
of money adopted them, were regarded ac tem
porary and failed to induce any serious liqui-
I dation of long holdings.
Bradstrcct's on Trade.
j NEW YORK, Nov. S.â Hradstreet's tO-mOROW
j will say: Despite some variation In the cur
rents of trade distribution the aggregate move
ment continues of immense volume; In fact. If
- the aggregate of bank clearings In the country
j outside of the metropolis Is a trustworthy In
! dcx, as it no doubt Is, the country's trade
reached its highest mark In the month of Oc
tober. I'rices certainly showed marked s-trength
in view of the proportions of earlier advances.
In some lines of wholesale trading, notably dry
poods, there has been gome quieting of demand.
without, however, any perceptible effect to be
exercised upon values of textiles, which, ln
deed, are more firmly held than ever. It has.
Indeed, been a tecord period in the w.v>l trade.
' Bales at th" leading centers having exceeded
all records for the week, and the strength alike
of the raw and the manufactured material is
most marked. Cotton goods are also very
Strong;, partly on the extraordinary demand nnl
partly because of the strength of the raw ma
terial. The great cereals have been rather dull
this week, with slight variation in price, ami
the markets appear to have come to a standstill
pending new developments.
In the iron and steel trade strength of values
Is perhaps the most notable feature, but activ
ity has been transferred fn>tn the finished
branch of the trade to the market for plg-
Iron, which har been very active n t full price*.
Reports of re-exp irts of American Iron from
Japan are confirmed. A heavy business was
done in hardware during October, relatively
the best reports coming from the West. Other
! metals fall to show as much strength, copper
1 and in b^lng considerably lower on the week.
â  In the lumlwr market demand varies with the
j material and the market involved, hut while
pine lumber is quieter at Western centers
prices are very firm and intimations of a con
tinuance of these conditions of further ad
vances are numerous. Influenced by the" activ
ity in the boot and shoe manufacturing dis
tributive trade (eather is strong and tends up
ward and some advances in hides are also re
ported.
"Wheat, Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 3.(M*!.K.',fi bushels, against 4,416.
--4X> la-st week. 6.773.643 In the corresponding
week of IR9S. G.890,4Mg In 1897, 3,472.976 in lS9fi and
i,666.W7 i n ISM.
While slvwing some Increases In number and
llahintie? over the summer and autumn months
business embarrassments for the month of Oc
tober furnish very satisfactory comparisons
with corresponding months of other years.
There were 816 failures, involving $6,774,000 in^
liabilities, from October a year ago, and com
parisons with earlier years" are even more fa
vorable.
Dun's 1 Review of Trade.
NEW YORK, Nov. 3.â R. G. Dun & Co.'a
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
British disasters in South Africa have brought
to view something besides the steady self-re
liance of the English people, that they hold
not many American securities to I"" dislodp*d
In any time of alarm, but are inclined to take
more when stocks and money luoks for siue
investment.
A little decline of %c In wheat and l%c in
corn does not hinder exports, though it is
some evidence that growers think they have
amplea supplies. Atlantic exports of wheat for
five weeks have been flour included, 15.C5G.599
bushels, against 18.1^2,631 bushels last year,
and Pacific exports 2 713 50l bushels, against
3,917,484 bushels last year.
Western receipts of wheat have continued
heavy, but have not rivaled last year's extra
ordinary outpouring, amounting to only 85,968.
--OS7 bushels in five weeks, against 49,f.40.7L'l
bushels last year, but Western corn receipts
run ahead of last year's In the same weeks,
and the t-xiiorts have been 15.t;4Â»i,044 bushels,
against 11,568,158 bushels last year.
The enormous sales of wool at Boston. 21,

are extremely important. That all are not for
consumption, as the trade is naturally tempted
to believe, may be true, and yet actual pur
chases by the mills of half that quantity would
imply extraordinary enrouragement respecting
the demand for woolen goods. The prices
have been generally advanced to an average
scarcity below that of May, 1592, and for Ohio
washed light and dark unwashed and pulled
wool slightly higher. Expectation of higher
prices at London prompt much speculative
buying, but the demand for woolen goods is
also undeniably encouraging.
Cotton manufacturers have also been in great
demand, with prices constantly rising so that
with middling uplands at 7.68 cents. good 9 are
relatively dearer in price than they have been
since October 1, but whether they will advance
much further depends upon the current esti
mates of the forthcoming crop.
Prices for pig iron for early deliveries are
still advancing, but as a great part of the de
mand has protected itself by contracts running
far into next year. Including purchases of 50,000
tons bessemer this week at $23 50, and as billets
are quoted at |S9 60 for spot, but J3S for nÂ»xt
year, the market can br Interpreted several
ways. Anthracite pig is also quoted at Ji'4 50
for early delivery. Rut no finished products
have advanced during the past week excepting
n-flned bars, which tho Eastern association has
put up $1 per ton. More weakness appears in
some lines of which the works have not orders
running far ahf-ad. But It Is claimed that

capacity, ha? been sold for next year. Tin

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, . Nov. 3.-Small Argentine ship
ments and higher cables, notwithstanding the |
decline here yesterday, started with a frac- I
tional advance over night. Shorts were appre- !
hensive for the moment because of some ex
citement In England over the Transvaal situa- |
tion, and some covering resulted. liquidation
on the bulce became so excessive, however,
that the demand was withdrawn and the mar
ket turned suddenly weak. From that point
until the end the course was downward. Put
figures were reached without meeting any op
position, and this fact alone added Impetus to
the selling movement. The main factor of
weakness was in the domestic visible, the In
dications being that an addition of over a
million bushels would be made during the week.
Light clearances, slow cash demand and the
reported imDroved condition of winter wheat
also had a depressing effect. December opened

Diminishing country offerings, owing to con
tinued wet weather, strengthened corn early.
An advance of 'Â1 at Liverpool also encour
aged buying, tout the market finally yielded un- \
der heavy liquidation. induced by a poor cash
demand and reports of a serious blockade at
Buffalo. The market wa* active throughout,
but dosed weak nt the bottom.
Oats followed other grains. There was no
special feature to the trade, prices ruling easy
within narrow limits. December closed at 22%

RADICAL VIEWS
ON PEDAGOGUES
Claims They Do Not
Teach Religion.
COMMENTS BY PROF. JORDAN
RABBI VOORSANGEB VOICES HIS
OPINION.
He Does Not Believe in Mixing Sci
ence With Religion â Rev. Dr.
Spalding Expresses Pro
nounced Ideas.
Rev. Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst, In his
sermon last Sunday morning in Madison
Square Presbyterian Church. New York,
criticized teachers in colleges and schools
for Ignoring religion in their treatment
of scientific subjects. He said:
"I want to caution you against the un
safe way of prosecuting natural scienti
flc studies. No one is lit to teach natural
science in an institution nominally re
ligious to whom nature does not stand
first of all as being the creation of God's
handiwork and as being, therefore, a
constant revelation of some at least of
tthfi attributes of him from whom it
sprung.
fortunately there are a great many
teachers in our educational institutions
selected by Christian trustees with an
?ye only to the scientific equipment
of the man they elect, but seemingly
with little concern for the effect which
scientific acumen, unaccompanied by pro
found religious discernment, is bound to
have in the way of converting the class
room into a seminary of infidels and athe
ists."
!The radical views of the eminent divine
were submitted to a number of well
known professional men yesterday, who
commented as follows on the propositions
set forth by Dr. I'arkhuist in his dis
course:
David Stan Jordan said:
College professors are very much like
other educated men. Most of them are
employed to do very special lines ol
work, and these in their classes attend
to their business. In outside matters they
are also like other people. Some are
very relictou? and some are not at all. In
the same way me are deeply interested in
;â  lltical movements and others relatively in- i
different to them. The tendency of thorough
Btudy in any neld is to turn men from emo
tionalism, from theological speculations and
from things that speedily pass away.
Truth Is serious and stern anil cannot be
wo I hy . mere enthusiasm. Exact training
teaches a man that the methods of the dialectl
*.:.ui can give no sound results. Hence the col- !
lege i rofessor has little respect for the details
of religious formulae and creeds. In so far as
1 â¢â¢â¢â¢achers and sects define religion â  â  cere
mony, emotion or belief in abstract propositions
i .rmulated in uncritical and metaphysical
t.-rms, the college professor like any other
man of affairs is Indifferent to It.
To the essentials of wisdom virtue, sound
conduct and the right relation of man to his
Maker, the average college professor is not in
different. Many of the wisest teachers of reli
gion and morality to-day are college professors,
and their host teaching is shown in their 'vow
i>f poverty' and their lifelong devotion to the
worship of truth. For to know truth is a. rell-
Kion in itself. One cannot teach religion by
talk alone. It takes a life behind It.
Rev. Dr. Voorsanger of Temple Emanu-
El discussed the subject as follows:
I do not believe In mixing up science with re- i
ligion. Science and religion aretaught by different
methods. Cine Is a pure classification of mental
experiences and results to be deduced from ;
them, to be adapted to the needs and condi
tions of society; the other is an instrument for j
it ho regulation of conduct and for the ordering
of all ways pertaining to men. so that they ;
may live in harmony with one another and may ;
appreciate the great fact that God is ruler of ;
all men. -- I no nr-t â¢ mean - to say that I
sclenca should not teach God, nor i
that religion should deny the ad- j
vantages of scientific training in the work
thai is before it. Hut I cannot see the neces
f-lty of teaching science by religious methods,
nor religion by scientific methods. The two
ar-i p?rarate and distinct processes, probably
to cain the same end, but their methods are
separate' and distinct. If that fact were more
appreciated probably Pr. Parkhurst would not
.have any trouble. An atheistic teacher of
eri^ncp can do very little harm if the scientific
teachers of religion understand their business.
Rev. Dr. ruling, rector of St. John's
Episcopal Church, holds that the power
of Almighty God should bo recognized in
all studies, scientific and otherwise: that
as all power comes from Him, so this
power should be recognized. He thinks
that one of the dangers of the day is
a tendency to the divorce of scientific i
studies from the power or God, and Is
heartily in sympathy with a movement
which is on foot by which God should
b* recognized, â - eclrlly in the studies
of nature.
Earnest Carroll Moore of the depart
mont of philosophy. University of Cali
fornia, said:
The charge that the scientist Is not a relig
ious â  man is very frequently repeated. It has
always had a certain Justification in the past: I
It has a certain justification now. Religion i
an-i religious men are always justified in pro
testing against the dogmatisms of any scientist
who may so far forfc-ct his Hiopocratic oath
ns to ceasÂ» to be a scientist and become a rea- i
sonless asserter concerning things religious
The scientist who ceases to be a scientist Is
fair game anywhere. There have been many
s-'if-h. though happHj their number Is rapidly I
becoming fewer. Against such men protest Is
bin-ays In order, but to assert that such pffudo
scientists fill the chairs of state universities
Is a monstrous untruth. For such an assertion
is more than a criticism; it is an lmneach
nient of the intellectual integrity of * State
teachers.
The charge does not state that certain forms
of. utii'lyâ certain sciences are necessarily
atheistic. The curriculum of a denominational
university is the same as that of a State uni
versity of like rar.k. It is not then the body of
sclrntinV facts which produces godlessnesg- It ;
is some departure from them; and this depart
ure the real scientist cannot make, for he must
stick to the farts, which Id themselves are not
objectionable. The charge then Is that teaeh
â¦rs in State universities are not scientists
which as a general statement will Instantly
be seen to be absurd. That their work Is of
very high scientltio value Is everywhere ad
mitted. That tlvir methods are not consist- !
ently scientific has only to be stated to be at
once scouted everywhere.
Such a charge almost 'always haa a deeper
meaning. 1. c.. that Mice and revelation are
inherently antagonistic. The theologian is
f.metlmes Inclined to believe that God has
once and for all made known his will; the
â¢dentist that the ultimata nature of things
yet r. mains to he discovered. But these are
bath half truths. If God created the world It
is fair to suppose that the student win find
him In his work. If Ood mad. hJmwif known
to human experience it It fair to suppose that
he. still does so. All arch Is search for God
or the cause, of things. . But it always leads
us to revise f , ur past experience and knowl
edge of God, and here I. the rub
Thoee who would rely upon that which we
already know of Ood condemned Anaxagoras

When Mayor Pholan and Assessor
Dodge prate loudly In the hustings of
what they have done and are to do, there
Is never a word said about the wonderful
energy displayed by the thrifty Dr. Dodge
In putting money In his own hungry purse
at the expense of the people.
It has just been realized that Assessor
' Dodge has during the first fiscal year
' put $16,273 5S into his own pocket In ad
dition to his liberal salary of JMOOO, by
i breaking the record in the collection of
, poll taxes and by pocketing the 15 per
cent allowed by law for Its collection,
! meanwhile making the collection of poll
tax by salaried deputies at the expense
I of the city instead of paying them out of
â  the commissions as contemplated by law.
It is not remarkable that Phelan and
! Dodge have done no bragging about j
Dodge's poll tax record. It is not sur
prising that they have said nothing about
that little 15 per cent, worth $16,273 58 to
I Dr. Washington Dodge. That does not
appear in any way in Dodge's official re
port nor in their public speeches. The
good Mr. Phelan, watcndog of the
treasury, and by law responsible for the
i proper conduct of municipal offices,
doesn't take the public into his confidence
as to how his chief pet got away with
$16 273 58 as a reward of thrifty energy.
And Dr. Washington Dodge does not
glorify himself, in public at least, on >..e
way he made every mother's son "pony
!up his little $2 in order that ne might
1 pocket SO cents, while the city treasury
got 37 cents. But Mayor Phelan lias
"hefted" Dr. Washington Dodge and
! found him Just the right thing.
The gist of the pretty little situation
! that is so darkly obscured to the public
I eye is that while displaying great zeal
i in collecting the most universally ..^tested
tax that the laws Impose, he felt the spur
of selfish thrift to the tune of the |
thousands mentioned because the law
! allows Assessors 15 per cent of the poll ]
taxes collected. The law contemplates
that this commission shall pay the cost
of collection. Assessor Dodge, however,
has chiefly, If not entirely, used in this !
work the regular and special deput'.es,
whose salaries are paid by the city, lhe
I wrong of this is apparent when It Is re
i membered that all poll taxes go into the
State school fund. San Francisco gets
back her share in the apportionment of
school funds, but this share is but a trifle
more than the thrifty Assessor's.
Assessor Dodge's salary bill for extra
deputies during the past fiscal year was
$79,394. the greatest in many years, and
$6784 more than the average for the pre
! coding four years. The city paid for the
whole collection.
Section 3862 reads: "The Assessor, foi
services rendered in the collection of poll
taxes shall receive the sum of fifteen per
cent: and the collector, for services ren
dered in the collection of poll taxes on
the delinquent list, shall receive the gum
of twenty-five per cent on all delinquent
poll taxes received by him."
Through the State this is understood to
mean that this commission shall cover
the cost of collection and shall not be a
bonus given to salaried officials. Asses
sor Dodge appears to assume that it is
simply a reward of merit paid by the
State for energy in keeping deputies paid
by the city at work.
"That 15 per cent is used to pay depu
ties and some of it goes to the Assessor,
as the law provides." said Dr. Dodge's
chief deputy yesterday, with an avoid
ance of details.
Salaried deputies have been collecting
poll taxes and employes of the Assessor's
office haven't heard of anybody working
there on commission.
It is understood that this has been the
practice of former Assessors and that
Dodge availed himself of a custom
that had been honored before. If he
wanted men to Coiled poll taxes at 30
cents a head he could get a regiment in a
day It would bo interesting to know how
much In salaries San Francisco's $20,287.74,
all that it gets out of $108,490.58, cost the
treasury-
When the Assessor reports the receipts
of poll tax he gives the net 85 per cent
and never says a word about commis
sions. Assessor Dodge's report for the
fiscal year IS9B-99 reads:
RECEIPTS.
i Tax on personal property (unsecured). |r,:!6. 6oÃ 18
[ Poll tax 82.217 00
Total $618,825 IS
His report does not contain the word
"poll tax." Again,, this $92,217 is what he
turns over to the Treasurer. It Is 85 per
cent of the total receipts, which were thus
$108,490.68. This $92,217 goes to the State
school fund. The apportionment gives
San Francisco $445,267.68 out of a total of
$2,044,029, and San Francisco's portion of
Its poll taxes is thus $20,287.74, according
to this ratio. It is a little less than 22 per
cent of 85 per cent.
Assessor Dodge's energy in collecting
poll taxes 1b shown by the following rec
ord of net poll tax receipts in San Fran
cisco for five years: 1895. $69,367; IS9&, f7i.
--21Â«; 1597, $72,124; 1898, $73,604; 1899, $92,217.
The average for the four years preceding
IS9B-99 was $72,077. Dodge's excess of this
average by $20,140 looks like admirable ef
ficiency until the 15 per cent is figured out
to be $16,273.58. or $3554.58 more than the
average commissions made by Assessors
In the preceding four years.
It cost Dodge $112,831.35 to run his office
one year, and In this, too, he broke a
record. Regular deputies cost as usual.
about $24,300. Extra deputies cost $79,
--394.88. For the preceding four years the
cost of extra deputies was as follows:
1895. $64,655.59; 1896, $78,977.42; 1897, $74.0: C;
1898. $72,910.
How much of this extra cost paid for
poll tax collection?
How many deputies collected poll tax

ANOTHER OFFICER ON THE RACK
Second Lieutenant Mumford of the
Forty-Fifth to Be Examined.
It will be a week yet before any of ihe
regiments at the Presidio will get away,
as it has been decided that it is better
to keep tne men here where they can be
well drilled until they are needed in the
islands. As a consequence no transports
will sail until well along toward next
| Saturday.
Another cause for delay is found In the
examinations now pending for the fitness
of officers. Second Lieutenant E. W.
; Mumford of the Forty-fifth has been or
dered before the board that is examining
i officers from the Forty-sixth. There ni*i
! probably be other recommendations for
j examination before the regiments go, both
|as to mental and physical fitness. One of j
I these to be examined for physical fitness
I Is Second Lieutenant C. E. N. Howard
of the Forty-fifth, who has been ordered
before a board composed of Major Philip
F. Harvey, surgeon; Captain Henry A.
Shaw, assistant surgeon, and First Lieu
tenant C. B. Millhoff, assistant surgeon.
It has been reported that there are ten
of the officers of the Forty-fourth that
will also appear before the same boaid.

geon, left last night for the Government

REPLY TO DR. VOORSANGER.
Holland Americans Object to His Be-
cent Criticism of the Boers.
Several days ago Rabbi Voorsanger de
livered an address on the troubles in
South Africa. His remarks concerning
the Boers have created some comment
among the Holland-American citizens of
this city. They were discussed at the
last meeting of the Netherland Society
Wllhelmina, which was largely attended.
The position of Dr. Voorsanger was at
tacked in the following resolution, which
was unanimously adopted:
Whereas, The Rev. Dr. J. Voorsanger has
expressed himself on the Transvaal Boers in
the public press as being non-progressive, in
tolerant and semi-savage.
Whereas, Such Ignorance on the part of any
American citizen would be surprising and Is
the more bo in the present Instance as the
Bald Rev. Dr. J. Voorsanger is a born Hol
lander and should have other than English
sources from which to obtain his Information.
Whereas, The Boers are as progressive as the
peculiar circumstances under which they live
will permit, as Is fully shown in their conduct
of the present war, and
Whereas. It i.= unjustifiable slander to term
the Transvaal Boers semi-savages; be it
Resolved, That we, of Holland birth, pro
test with all our strength against the Injustice
done the Boers by the Rev. Dr. J. Voorsanger,
and know them to be fully worthy of the
hearty sympathy of every enlightened man in
their present struggle for liberty and inde
pendence.
SAYS HE WAS SLANDERED.
Litigation hns been renewed between
W. A. Nevills and William EL Martin,
owners of the Rawhide mine. For some
weeks past these gentlemen have re
muined inactive, but developments prove
that this condition was only the lull be
tween the gone and the gathering storm.
Nevills came into court yesterday and
Bled suit against Martin to recover $150,
--rnngt-is for slander. In his complaint
Nevills alleges that the defendant, wick
edly and maliciously intending to injure
him in his good name and credit and to
bring him Into public scandal, notoriety
and disgrace among persons to whom he
was known and to cause, it to be suspect
ed by such persons that the plaintin* was
guilty <>f thefl and to submit him to the
pains and penalties of the law and to vex
harass; and ruin him. told various persons'
that "Nevills was a thlpf and had
stolen $300,000 from the Rawhide mine and
had s..!d stolen gold to a Chinaman and
wanted to Â«et back as manager of the
mine so as to steal more."
Through these alleged statements of the
defendant Nevills says that he haa been
brought Into scandal, infamy and dis
grace, as many persons still believe that
the charge of thoft Is true

NO REASON FOR
ALEXANDER TO
TARE HIS LIFE
Was in No Danger of
Being Deposed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 3.
An inquest will be held to-morrow even
ing in the case of C. O. Alexander, who
committed suicide by drowning last night. !
In a letter written to his wife the assist
ant postmaster shows that he had on
Wednesday afternoon made up his mind
to end his life. In this letter Alexander
said that, in view of the insinuations and
rumors that were being passed around
concerning his character, he had decided
it was better to leave the scene of his
troubles.
That there was something wrong with
Alexander's work in the poatofflce is not
denied by anybody, but it was merely
backwardness in clerical work, and all as-
Bert that there is not a particle of foun
dation for any story that he was short In
his acounts.
Postmaster Friend has made a very
thorough examination of the office and
declares that Alexander was never dis
honest. _
"It is true," said Mr. Friend, "that T
counted the money in the office quite of
ten but that was my duty, and in no way
reflected upon Mr. Alexander. Nothing;
occurred yesterday to irritate Mr. Alex- |
ander who wont out as usual at noon for |
his lunch, but did not come back. As it
was, the little trouble that the inspector
found regarding the report could have
been settled up very easily, and before he
committed suicide his best friends had
undertaken to settle the matter at Wash
ington."
Postal Inspector Trwin found the ac
counts correct yesterday when Mr. Friend
made his settlement for October at tne
T'nited States Sub-Treasury. The sensa- I
tlonal report that Alexander had got j
away with a large amount of money is :
baseless Senator Stratton. Congressman |
: Metcalf and Senator Perkins, as soon as
they heard of Alexander's difficulty with
the' Postal Inspector, came to his relief
and did all they could to disprove the sto
ries that were being circulated on the
street, but Alexander was an extremely
highstrung and sensitive man and could
not live to see himself disgraced.
Senator Perkins, who recommended the
appointment of Mr. Alexander as assist
ant postmaster, said this morning that
the only trouble with the office was that |
reports'and accounts were not brought up i
!to date. This is shown by the fact that ]
I one balance sheet showed an excess of i
MOO In Alexander's favor, while another i
, one showed $700 against him. and when all j
! was settled up the accounts were found |
correct. _
"I wish to say," said Senator Perkins, !
"that the circumstances under which j
Alexander was appointed have often been \
> misrepresented. Mr. Hilborn. who was
i then Congressman, joined with me in the
; recommendation of Mr. Friend for post- 1
master I have the highest opinion of Mr.
', Friend believing him to be an honest ;
' man Mr. Hilborn also joined with me in :
i recommending Mr. Alexander, but we ex- ;
acted no pledge from Friend to appoint
Alexander."
Rev. C. M. Miel. an Episcopal minister;
1 of Sacramento, who officiated at the wed- ;
! ding of Mr. and Mrs. Alexander ten yean
' ago will conduct the funeral services at j
the residence Âf the deceased in East
Oakland on SunVay afternoon. The widow
i has selected the following pall bearers: ;
; A H. Small, Rudolph Spreekels, W. B.
Hamilton. E. M. Hall, Victor 11. Metcalf j
and F S. Stratton.
Postmaster Friend has temporarily
placed ex-Assistant Postmaster Mil tin in
charge of the office recently presided over
by Mr. Alexander.

THEIR FAMILY
SKELETON AT A
CRIMINAL TRIAL
Cruelty of Schmidt Is
Told in Court.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 3.
A family skeleton was unveiled at the
trial of Jacob G. Schmidt, charged with
assaulting his parents-in-law with a
deadly weapon, which was commenced
before a jury In Judge Hail's court to
day.
Schmidt, it appears, called on hiÃ ex
wife at the home of her parents, Mr. and
Mrs. M. F. Meinert, in East Oakland,
several Sundays ago, in the hope of ef
fecting a reconciliation. But almost on
the threshold he met his father-in-law,
and one word led to another until Schmidt
is said to have whipped out his revolver
and threatened to shoot the top of his
father-in-law's head off.
Among the very first witnesses called
was the accused man's mother-in-law,
Mrs. Johanna M. F. Meinert, who testi
fied that when Schmidt married her
daughter in 1894 the latter was not of age.
"I gave my consent." continued the wit
ness, "but I did not know Schmidt as
well then as I do now. After they had
been married about two years my daugh
ter secured a divorce on the ground of
cruelty, failure to provide and Infidelity.
But she forgave him later; they kissed
and made up. and soon married again.
About six months ago my daughter was
once more compelled to sue for a divorce.
She secured a decree, and we have re
fused to allow Schmidt to visit our house
ever since, though he has persistently
come around, insisting on being admitted,
and on one occasion he broke down a door
to get into the house.
"The last time he called, when I was
there, he shoved a revolver under my
nose and I screamed and ran away for
my life."
Tho trial will be resumed to-morrow
morning. Schmidt, it is said, will take
the witness stand in his own behalf and
promises to recite a tale of matrimonial
troubles and too murh mother-in-law.
TELEPHONE THAT WORKS
WITHOUT HELLO GIRLS
OAKLAND, Nov. 3.â The first step In
the direction of an opposition telephone
service In Oakland was taken this after
noon when Attorney Albert C. Aiken filed
articles of incorporation of the Oakland
Automatic Telephone Company, with a
stated capital stock of $350,000," of which
$500 has already been subscribed by the
following directors in sums of $100 each:
Albert C. Aiken of San Francisco, William
A. Magee, Charles B. Taylor, Samuel S.
Teller and E. C. Dozier.
The modus operandi of the automatic
telephone has already been exploited in
The Call. One of its chief features Is the
fact that each subscriber rings up the
number desired direct from his telephone,
thus the need of "central."
The new concern has taken quarters in
the Delger block and Mr. Aiken "ives the
assurance that if it receives the proper
backing in encouragement from pros
pective subscribers a plant will be put la
shortly.

Old ti-arnster, who for the past ten years
has been a familiar figure about Alameda,
was foumi dead in his bed this morning
by Marcus White. Death had occurred
some time during the night from heart
disease. He had lived for about four
years alone in a little house in the rear
of Thomas White's residence, 2228 Pacific
avenue. Owing to an attack of illnesa
he had not been working since Wednes
day, but yesterday he was about. Mar
cus White went to see how he was and
found him dead. Deputy Coroner Fowler
was notified and the body was removed to
the Morgue. It is not probable that an '
Inquest will be necessary, as he had been
attended by a physician previous to his
death.
Deceased was born in Saratoga County,
New York, seventy years ago. He came
to California frn the early days of the
gold excitement and was widely known
in the mines at Virginia City and else
where as an old-time stagedrlver and
teamster. During the time he has been
in Alameda he has been engaged in haul
ing sand for plasterers. He had no rela
tives living, as far as he knew, in his
later years.

Mothers Discuss School Matters.
At the mothers' meeting held in the La
guna Honda School in the Sunset district
Thursday afternoon several subjects were
ably discussed, among them the proposi
tion of kindergartens and the enlargement
of children's playgrounds.
Miss Panning, one of the leading kinder
garten educators of the Pacific Coast, ad
dressed the meeting. She spoke upon the
spiritual duty of the mother to the child
as opposed to the mere physical duty.
She related how the kindergarten assisted
in the realization of an ideal motherhood.
Light refreshments were served, after
which the meeting adiourned until the
first Thursday in December.
GRAHAM AKERLY
DID NOT FILL
A CUBAN GRAVE
Legacy From Mother
Awaits Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 3.
Graham Akerly. son of the late Ben
jamin Akerly, pioneer rector of St. John's
| Church, who was supposed to have met
death on a battlefield of Cuba, is reported
to be alive. Old friends declare as an
incontrovertible fact that they have seen
him in San Francisco within the past few
days, and that, though he seemed much
reduced in health, he expressed no desire
to return to Oakland.
Akerly is wholly oblivious of the fact
that the estate or his mother, Catherine
Akerly, also deceased, was closed up last
] March, and that his share, a snug legacy
of several hundred dollars, has been lying
in the county treasury ever since awaiting
a claimant.
Akerly's disappearance In 1597 was
coupled with a love affair. In January of
j that year his wife, Carrie C. Akerly, sued
i him for a divorce. Owing to his absence
summons was served by publication in a
newspaper. in the following November
the divorce was granted and about that
time Akerly returned and fell in love with
| the daughter of a wealthy local merchant,
who was opposed to the match. There
: after, and about the time hostilities broke
I out between America and Spain, Akerly
disappeared for parts unknown and the
only information ever received concerning
him thereafter was to the effect that he

; Ladies of the Potrero to the Front in
a Laudable Cause.
The basement of St. Teresa's Cathollo
i Church on Nineteenth and Tennessee

Echool like appearance Into a bower of
I beauty by an abundance of bunting and
1 cut flowers, with a handsome collection

I raising funds for the benefit of the church
! and Bunday-school attached thereto.
The bazaar proper was opened last

! night the Rev. Father P. O'Connell, pas
, tor. and his assistant. Rev. Father James
'â  Mebln, were present and aided the ladles
1 In the good work before them.
! The several booths are arranged on both
; Bldc-s of the building and at the north and
i opposite entrance, all of which tend to
make the scene attractive to those who
! tvlll visit It during the period of its cx
i istence. It was announoed that Mayor
'â  Phelan would visit the bazaar last nlgac
â¢ if he could get away from his political en
gagements.
The names of the ladles having charge
jof the various booths are: Mrs. John
! Flannagnn, Mrs. Harry O'Donnoll, Miss
I Sarah Lennon, Miss . Annie Cullen, Mrs.

i street.
! The programme, which consisted of mv- !
aic, both instrumental and vocal, recita
tions and fancy dances, had been so care

; pieces Charles McAuliffe entertained those i
i present with some of his quaint stories
' and inimitable fancy dances.

: was a grand success, the receipts exceed- !
ing the most enthusiastic hopes of those !

The Celtic societies of San Francisco

Invitation, representatives of the Holland,
French and Swedish societies were pres
ent, and will participate in the mass
meeting. The societies named met at 1133

sided. After considerable argument It

An effort will l>e made to secure the
services of some of the most prominent
orators of the city. Resolutions will be
framed expressing the sympathy of the

CLUMSY IMPOSITION.
A Few Enterprising Manipulators
Decide to Hold a Dewey
Celebration.
What purports to be a "Dewey celobra
i tlon" is to be glv* n to-night at Mechanics'
i Pavilion. Committees have been an
| nounced, subscriptions have been ob
! talned, a programme has been published,
I a parade has been arrang-ed, and a mv
; slcal and literary programme has been
! prepared. The entire affair Is an imposi
i tion upon the- public and a gross misrep
j resenlation. Isames of prominent men
j have been used utterly -without authority
upon the committees. Speakers have been
announced, but â will not attend, as they
were never consulted in the matter. The
promoters of the "celebration" represent
to the public wrongfully that the affair Is
i the result of a concerted action of several
local Bcoietirs. As a matter of fact, the
"Dewey celebration" is nothing more or
i less" than the venture of a few persons
; who represent nobody but themselves

GOOD DEMAND FOR REALTY.
THE real estate market is steadily im
proving and although the present mu
nicipal campaign has had a deterrent
effect it is but temporary, and with
politics relegated to the rear there will,
unless all signs fall, be a decided revival
of business in realty transactions during
the coming winter months. The condi
tion of the market is clearly and concise
ly set forth in the Real Estate Circular for
October, just out, published by Thomas
Magee & Sons, as follows:
"The real estate market is doing well.
It is without excitement of any kind or
any tendency or sign of boom. Until late
ly buyers would only look at the very best
Inside property, that was steadily paying
and always certain to do so. Now they
are beginning to look at property that
doeÃ not steadily rent and whose value
is more in the near future than in the im
mediate present. In other words, whatâ
because of the trend of business and
rrowth of the cityâ is on the threshold
of being inside property, is now consid
ered, and some of it is being bought.
Such property is a better buy than the
best Inside property. The latter has
reached, not an actual maximum of
values by any means, but a comparative
maximum; the latter has only begun to
move forward and is certain to have a
fine future.
"There tfl Borne demand for purchases
and considerable demand from lessees for
property down by South Beach at or near
the railroad tracks.
"There Is a moderate demand for dwell
ing lots and houses and lots westward,
out along the cable lines, between Mc-
Allister r-nd Haight streets, and a very
good demand for residence lots and resi
dences and lots out Pacific Heightsward,
at full prices always and advancing prices
in some cases.
"Property owners In outside districts,
where a sale of any kind is a novelty,
are beginning to mark up their unsalable
lote, because there has been some move
ment In downtown business property.
There Is not yet, however, the slightest
sign of a movement in any property on
the outskirts of the city in any direction.
To mark up the prices of such property
now will only result in making it more
unsalable than ever.
"The total number of sales made vi Oc
tober was 254, of the value of $1,204,788."
Referring also to the condition of the
market the Real Estate Record, published
by G. H. Umbsen & Co., says:
"Real estate has taken on new life dur
ing the last month. The improvement
has been mainly in the 50-vara and the
100-vara districts, in each of which sec
tions there have been several investments,
ranging above $50, 500, while the Western
Addition holds its own and the Potrero
registers an advance over the previous
month. Downtown and centrally located
realty Is In good demand and investors
are evincing a disposition to come nearer
to the views of owners. The result is
more numerous transactions. Undoubted
ly the raiÂ»e have had a good effect on the
market, and should the season continue as
It has opened there is every reason to an
ticipate lively times during the coming
winter and spring."
The mo.Â«t important sale of the week
was made by Thomas Magee & Sons, who
sold the two-story and basement building
belonging to Mrs. J. S. Doe on the east
side of Fremont street, 183:4 south of Mar
ket, 43:10x137:6, to Miss Maud Bourn,
the price paid being $55,000. This
property adjoins the Mack prop
erty, which was sold about eight
months ago, including a new four
story and basement brick building, for
$110,000. FYemont street, between Market
and Mission, is now the best built-up
wholesale block in San Francisco. There
is but one gap to break the continuity of
fine buildings and that is where the recent
flro in that district destroyed the pro
perty 137:6x137:1} on the northeast corner
of Fremont and Mission streets. This
property is now being offered for sale by
Thomas Magee & Sons. An offer for the
site was recently made by one of the
largest firms in the city, who propose to
erect thereon a five-story brick building,
two-thirds of which they intend to occupy
themselves.

thority of the Superintendent.
NOTEâ The high and low waters occur at
the city front (Mission-street wharf) about
twenty-five minutes later than at Fort Point;
the height of tide is the same at both places.
SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 4.
NOTEâ In the above exposition of the tides
the early morning tides are given In the left
hand column and the successive tides of the
day In the order of occurrence as to time. The
second time column gives the second tide of
the day, the third time column the third tide
and the last or right hand column gives the
last tide of the day, except when there are but
three tides, as sometimes occurs. The heights
given are in addition to the soundings on the
United States Coast Survey charts, except
when a minus sign (â ) precedes the height,
and then the number given is subtracted from
the depth given by the charts. The plane of
reference is the mean of the lower low waters.

DAVIS WINS THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE;
PHELAN SURRENDERS TO THE BOSSES
Republicans Note
the Signs of
Victory*
Sad Spectacle of Phelan
Seeking Sympathy
From Buckley's
Old Gang*
THE tide is running high for Horace
Davis. The great mass meetings
throughout the city and the un
bounded enthusiasm of the people
attest the rowing strength and
popularity of the Republican leader.
Alarmed Democrats are on the verge
,of demoralization. The open help of
â  Buckley organizations which Phelan
[spurned early In the campaign is eagerly
Bought to save the Democratic ticket
! from overwhelming defeat. The Demo
| cratic Central Club, an organization
' which Phelan refused to speak before
prior to the primary election because it
was tainted with Buckleyism, will attend
a Phelan mass meeting and bo addressed
by } helan to-night. The drill corps, which
was equipped by Buckley, will wear a
uniform of white, trimmed with black
braid. Each man will carry in the proces
sion a campaign flag and a largo Buckley
â¢ tin horn, which will be tooted for Phelan.
Bo equipped the uniformed followers of
Buckley will march down Marl street.
The people should not miss the spectacle.
Before the primary election the place
hunters, comprising McNab's Committee
of One Hundred, threw up their hands in
glee when. Phelan declined to attend the
meeting of the Democratic Central Club
because it was a Buckley club. It is dif-
rent now. The place-hunters, having
captured the convention, want votes to
elect Phelan. The so-called anti-boss
Mayor has taken the bosses into full fel
lowship. Boss Rairiey enjoys the special
confidence of Phelan and has been prom
ised School Department patronage to help
along where Fire Department pulls are
not potential.
Is it riot high time for the people of San
Francisco to array themselves in their
might against Phelan and the odious
bosses who thrive on the money contrib
ute by the taxpayers to maintain the
municipal government?
Mayor Phelan once had the confidence
of the people. Thousands of Republicans
voted for him in 1896 and again In .1898.
They believed he was sincere In bis pro
fessions of antl-bossism. Now in the
â¢open light 01 campaign revelation they
see how he Bias fallen. Here he is with
bis cloak of reform and political decency
cast aside, begging for the favor of boss-
Is ir. and appealing for political support to
the king of bosses.
The old-time allies of the Democratic
party known as Non-Partisans have
come out of ambush and, as usual, are
supporting the Democratic nominees.
Tne Non-Partldan following now consists
oÂ£ Phelan's brother-in-law, Frank J. Sul
livan, George K. Fitch and Joseph Brit
ton. For tne Bake of appearance two or
three Republicans are indorsed, but the
whole pretense of selecting the best men
fmm both parties is proved to be a fraud
and a fake.
The men who are in this so-called Non-
Partlsan movement were foremost in ef
forts to break down the Stratton
primary law In the courts. The law
which makes it possible for the people. to
hold an honest election for delegates to
the nominating convention Is assailed by
th.-se Non-Partisan fakers. Republican
voters should not be deceived by the shal
low tricks of Phelan's brother-in-law,
Sullivan.
Republicans should be on their guard
against all trading propositions. Nomi
nees should ear in mind that the Civil
Service Commission, to â â â  appointed i>y
the Mayor, will fill the positions In Tie
County Clerk's ofiiee, the Sheriffs depart- i
ment ai.d other oinces In the new City
Hall. ThÂ« splendid campaign conducted
by William A. Deane and John Lackmann
Is commendable, but individual workers
for â  â ?<* nominees, as well as tho work
ers for other candidates, should under
stand that the victory which they desire
will be fruitless if Phelan is elected
Mayor. Good government and excellent
service in â¢he various departments of th*3
municipality may be obtained through
the agency of a Civil Service Commission
appointed'by Horace Davis. It is there
fore essential that Deane's friends. Lack- ,
manns friends and the friends or every
other candidate on the Republican ticket
should vote for Horace Davis.
To-night people of the Thirty-fifth and
Thirty-sixth Assembly districts will rally
at Ocean View and listen to Republican
orators. ' ,
Th re will, be a meeting to-night of the
Horace Davis Club of the Thirty-fourth
Assembly District, at Eighteenth street,
between Valencia and Guerrero.
A Joint meeting of the people of the
Forty-third, Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth
. Assembly districts will be held to-night
under the auspices of the Montezuma Re
publican Club at Apollo Hall. Pacific
street, between Stockton and Powell.
The German-American Republican Club
â will give a demonstration to-night in fa
vor of Horace Davis at Norman's Hail,
413 Bush street. ... .
At Pioneer Hall a great meeting will be
held this evening under the auspices of
the Horace Davis Central Club. The gift
ed orator, Hon. F. X. Sehoonmaker.
whose presence in this campaign demor
alized Phelan and the bosses, will speak ,
to the people. He will have the temerity,
in the (ace of the Mayor's decree, to in
troduce national questions. He will sa
lute the flag and pay tribute to the excel
lent administration of William McKlnley,
which' has brought so much prosperity to
Our little Mayor said in addressing the
Monticello Club at Metropolitan Temple
Friday evening, October 27. that if re
elected he would not appoint on the-
School Board, the Civil Service Commis
sion or on any of the commissions under
the new charter Republicans who saw fit
to introduce national issues in this con
test HJs oath of office would require him
to' appoint Democrats and Republicans,
but he would undertake to decide what
sentiments one might entertain to be re
rarded as a Republican. In advance he
rave notice that any Republican who
voted against Phelan would be classed a3

HAVES VALLEY IS
STRONG FOR DAVIS
Bonfires, fireworks and music by the
band attracted Hayes Valley residents to
Howry's Hall in flocks last night. The
Thirty-seventh District was well repre
sented at the greatest Republican rally
held in that part of town during the last
flva years.
Joseph K. Jones presided over the meet
ing, and hip introductory speech, referring
â¢ â¢ Horace Davis as the n.-xt Mayor of
Hnn Francisco, called forth a burst ol en
thusiasm and cheering which was both
spontaneous and genuine.
Lucius Solomons was the first of the
many speakers who intt rested the large
number of auditors present with honest
and logical expositions of the Issues of
the. present campaign. F. X. Schoonma
ker, Ju'iiv- pooney, Myron Wolfe and the
jrroat majority of candidates followed, all
receiving a testimonial of the support
that will be accorded them Tuesday.
From beginning to end the meeting was
of the moM enthusiastic order, and at no
time did the large crowd show impatience
or any desire to leave the hall until the
lasl speaker had finished his remarks and
â¢and played "Home, Sweet Home."

of the hall was taxed to the limit, and
many who could not find places on the
benches stood throughout the entire meet

One of the first speakers of the evening

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. NOVEMBER 4. 1899.
DEASY WILL NOT
VOTE FOR PHELAN
Jeremiah Densy is not going to vote for
Phelan for Mayor. Even though he owes
bis nomination as Sh'-rifT on the Demo
cratic ticket to the manipulations of Mr.
Phelan, he is not going to cast his ballot
for James. He cannot. Mr. Deasy will
not even be able to vote for himself at
this election, for he has deprived himself
of the American citizen's greatest privi
lege.
It appears that It was Mr. Deasy's prac- |
tlce in former years to register from I
wherever he thought, or thÂ»- Democratic
s thought, a few votes would be
needed. Last year the Democracy was
! shy a candidate for Supervisor from the
! Tenth District, and the arcnminnd-itlnt;
Mr. Deasy left his family out at 834 Fulton
street and took up his residence In ;i shoe
shop on Sixth street. He thus, according
to his view of tilings and the lights of \h>
' Democratic manipulators, became a resi
dent of the Tonth Supervisorial District,
aml la now representing that section in
the Board of Supervisors, although his
home is in an entirely different part of
I the city.
Deasy has changed around so frequent
i ly. Just to please the politicians with
' whom he trains, that his residence Is al
j most as much in doubt ns that of Mayor
j Phelan. For political purposes he ap
pi ars to make his home in his hat, and
he registers from whatever peg he hap
pens to hang his top gear.
Previous to the nominating conventions
i last year, Mr. Deasy was struck with a
I good streak and registered from his "sure
i enough" ifesidence, 834 Fulton street. The
' records at the Registrar's oftlc" give the
i date of his affidavit as June 13. 1898. This
was before the Supervisorial lightning
j had struck him, or Democrats had dis
covered that candidates and votes were
scarce in the Tenth District. Mr. Deasy,
ever ready to assist his party in any
scheme, from the colonization of voters
j right down the list of Jobbery practiced
! by political pirates, moved at once. On
i October 4 he notified the Registrar that
| he had changed his residence to 24 Sixth
' street, and made affidavit that that ad
i dress was his legitimate place of Ã¼bode.
The transfer was made Just In time to
permit Mr. Deasy to vote from the dis
-1 trict at the succeeding election, and after
: word to enable him to qualify as tn<>
: Supervisor from the Tenth.
Of course, after he was seated as a
! member of the Board of Supervisors he
' returned to the bosom of his family out
at 534 Fulton street and again began to
enjoy- the comforts of home. But he for
goi to teH the Registrar that the sleep
: ing accommodations in the Tenth Super
visorial District had no charms for him.
There may have been reasons, for him
keeping the matter off the records. The
truth might have jeopardized his sÂ»at on
I the board, and rather than do that It is
1 to be presumed that he had no objection
I to the Registrar and the voters believ
ing that he was still residing In his Sixth
i street shoeshop. slumbering at night on
I the soft side of a cobbler's bench and
taking his meals off the front counter.
When Mr. Doasy became a candidate
i for Sheriff his residence In the Tenth Dls
! trict was no longer a matter of political
j necessity. He evidently thought, how
' ever, that he might Just as well vote
i from the shoe-shop home and let his reg
i lstration stand. The searching Investiga
tions of thn Registrar proved disastrous
, to Mr. Deasy. and when he received no
tice that he would have to show cause
why his name should not be stricken
from the register" of qualified voters of
the city be tirst became mad, then sad
and finally scared. He wÂ«nt to the Reg
! istrar"s office and to prevent exposure of
the questionable political practices to
', which It appears he was a party, re
quested Mr. Steppacher to take his name
<iff the rolls and say no more about it.
That is why Mr. Deasy Is not going to
| vote for Mr. Phelan this year. That la
: why Mr. Drasy is not going to vote at all
I next Tuesday.
WANT HORACE DAVIS
AND IMPROVEMENTS
At a meeting of the South Side Improve
ment Club at 3-0 Howard street last night
the indorsement of the Republican ticket
was reiterated. M. J. McÃride presided

lowed with a stirring talk, urging the
members of the club to vote for Horace
Davis as the best man that could have
been selected, not only for the laboring
men but for the smnll property owners,
who desired to see the city's money hon
estly expended in needed improvements.
Speeches were also made by William
Watson and representatives of John

JOHN LACKMANN.
An Honest Supervisor
Who Is Running
for Sheriff.
Something About the Man, His Record
and the Office to Which He Aspires,
and Reasons Why He Should
Be Elected.
There are some things in connection
with Supervisor John Lackmann's candi
dacy for the office of Sheriff which should
be considered by thoughtful voters on the
eve of election. Mr. Lackmann was
chosen Supervisor from the Sixth Ward
three years ago by a very narrow major
ity. He ran for the office comparatively
unknown. At the end of two years his
services to the people had become so con
spicuous that the Democratic party did
not have the courage to nominate a can
didate against him. He was elected Su
pervisor last year by a practically unani
mous vole or the electors of ban i*'ran
cisecJ.
II Mr. Lackmann had not served the
city taitbtuiiy tins tribute would not have
been paid to nis personal worm and cnar
acter. 'J.here is no other instance in local
msiory wnere an onicial baa so com
pletely commended himself to the masses
us to practically lorce an opposition into
me bacKgiouna.
The oiuce oi Sheriff, for which Mr.
Lackmann has now been nominated by
the Republican convention, is one of the
most important under the city govern
ment. Its incumbent comes m contact
with litigants and others wnose pocKets
are affected by his action. It is necessary
that a scrupulously careful and honest
man should rill the position, or a great
deal or damage may be done to private
interests and a great deal of personal in
jury mulcted upon litigants.
Mr. Lackmann is a careful, conscien
tious and upright official. He will dis
charge the duties of the office of. Sheriff
as he has discharged the duties of the of
fice of Supervisorâ with a scrupulous re
gard for the welfare of the puoiic and a
careful attention to the interests of liti
gants. He is pledged to low taxation,
economy and good government, and so far
as his 'lnfluence goes in the office of Sher
iff it will be exerted in those directions.
No voter takes chances of Lackmann
fulfilling his pledges, for he has been tried
In office through two critical terms and
has not been found wanting. In the Board
of Supervisors he has voted to reduce
water rates and gas rates and against
awarding railroad franchises for nothing.
lie has supported the dollar limit on tax
ation through two administrations. In
I*'j7, when Judge Wallace's deoree re
moved the entire Board of Supervisors,
he was the only Republican reappointed
by Mayor Phelan. .At that time he was
new in office, but he had already demon
strated the possession of a high order of
integrity and bad given promise of the
subsequent record which he has made.
He is in favor of public Improvements,
clean streets, cheap lights, a new sewer
system and all the. other rational things
demanded by a young and progressive
city. So far as his influence as Sheriff
goes he is himself a personal guarantee
of economy, observance of law and cor
rect administration.
Every voter 1n San Francisco must ree
ogriize the fact that unless faithful oiH
cials like Lackmann are rewarded It fs
only a question of time when a premium
will be placed upon bad government.
Lackmann's majority for Sheriff should
be so pronounced that no doubt will be
lift In the minds of anybody that the in
tention is to reward a man who in tho
face of the strongest temptation has man
fully, during a period of three years of
must trying adrnlniÃtrtion, stood up for
the people of all parties, all nationalities,
all classes and all conditions.
The best tribute which hns been paid to
Lackmann is found in the Examiner (a
Democratic newspaper) of November 12,
IKPS. Speaking of Laekmann's re-election
la^t year, after his trying experience in
the previous Board of Supervisors, tne
Examiner made the following remarks:
"John Lackmann is a small grocer on a
Bteep hill. He is not rich. He is not elo
quent. He is not particularly dowered
with that spirit of effusive geniality
which wins the hearts of the multitude.
Yet John Lackmann, a Republican, was
nominated or indorsed by all the parties
and received the vote and approval of
every honest man in San Francisco. Why?
"Simply because John Lackmann has
shown himself to be an honest office
holder. He has been true to the people.
So he leaves to his children and his chil
dren's children a heritage better than
great riches, and there is no right-think
ing citizen in the entire community who
would not feel proud of the acquaintance
of the small grocer of California street."
Coming from such a source, this praise
ought to strike deep into the consciences
of the people of San Francisco. It js op
position political opinion of a decisive
character.
CANDIDATES ADDRESS
GERMAN DEMOCRATS
The Gorman Democrats held an enthu
siastic ratification meeting last night at
their headquarters, 411 Bush street. The
fact that a musical programme was to be
presented and malted refreshments were
to be served attracted a large crowd,
though the spectators did not make their
appearance until after the result of the
ptize-figtu had been announced. Mayor
Phelan opportunely arrived at this junc
ture and he was greeted with hearty
cheers, which were repeated after he had
finished his somewhat brief speech. He
was introduced by M. Greenblatt, who
presided at the meeting, and made his
customary appeal for the suffrage of his
hearers by a recital of the many good
things he and his colleagues had done for
the community. Without attempting to
be egotistical, the pronoun "we" was re
peated ad libitum.
The other speakers of the evening were
Oscar Hooks, who made an urgent appeal
for the election of Deasy as Sheriff, and
("lit us Harbour, who introduced something
of Democratic national issues in his re
marks. A number of candidates appeared
during the evening and described their
own peculiar fitness for the offices to
which they aspire, to their own satisfac
tion and apparently to that of their au
ditors.

The Democrats of the Forty-third Dis
trict met last night at Apollo Hall, on
Pacific and Stockton streets, T J Pindar
acting as chairman. The hall was but
sparsely filled, and the little applause
from time to time served but to take the
Icy chill off the gathering.
The candidates wero slow in arriving
and not much enthusiasm was displayed'
Campaign issues were discussed but sel
dom, most of the time bolng consumed
by a recitation of the transcendent virtues
of the nominees and the enduring trlorv
of the Democratic party. An occasion tl
variation was furnished by the band

MAYOR PHELAN
STATES THE ISSUES
What Success Will Signify.
In view of the false issues raised and
persistently advocated, I desire to say
that I and my colleagues will construe
our success at the polls as an indorse
ment of our official acts and the policy
we have established In expelling bossism
and corporate control from the City Hall,
and also as a rebuke to the gentlemen
who are seeking to destroy the principal
feature of the new charter, which. In re
quiring city elections separate and dis
tinct from national elections, designed to
insure a dispassionate business discussion
of local affairs uninfluenced by mere par
tisan zeal, which In the past has carried
men into office without respect to their
honesty or fitness, to the great injury of
our city.
I believe with the true and disinterested
friends of the charter that separate mu
nicipal elections are necessary for good
municipal government, and I ask the peo
ple, by their votes, to determine their
policy In this respect. If the attempt to
force national issues into city elections is
not rebuked at this time, the great bene
fits of the charter will be lost.
Notwithstanding false statements to
the contrary, the bi-partisan boards and
the civil service provisions give no party
a<^antage to either side in the matter of
patronage, which the charter has wisely
destroyed, unless the Mayor proves false
to his oath of office. The Mayor has but
thirty-three direct appointments. Civil
service rules regulate the appointment of
all the others, and the present members
of the School, Police and Fire depart
ments are secured in their positions by
the charter on good behavior, and cannot
be removed without cause after a trial.
If elected I will be loyal to the charter
and endeavor to firmly establish its prin
ciples and with least friction introduce
the reforms which it contemplates, actin?
wholly in full sympathy and accord with
its purposes and objects.
JAMES D. PHELAN.
GOOD NEWS FOR TEACHERS.
They May Receive Last Year's No
vember and December Salaries.
Auditor Wells Is of the opinion that the
decision of the Supreme Court regarding
the inheritance tax, under which the Stan
ford estate will *pay into the treasury
more than three hundred thousand dol
lars, will make It possible to pay school
teachers' salaries for last November and
December. The Auditor thinks that the
city's portion of the money may be made
available for the purpose. He is busy
now Inquiring into the law on th<- use to
which the money may be applied and ex
pects to announce his intention in a few
days.
The Auditor has finally decided to audit
the demand of C. B. Sessions, statistician
of the Board of Health, who was apointed
under the recent decision of Judge Hunt.
The demands of all the officers appointed
under that decision were held up and the
interested parties were preparing to man
damus the Auditor to sign the demands.
In the event of failing in this course the
employes expressed their determination
to sue' the Auditor and his bondsmen for
the amounts of their salaries. The salaries
of the other employes may be signed after
the Auditor has convinced himself that he
acted legally in the matter of Session's
salary.
