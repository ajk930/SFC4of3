â¢ of non-commissioned officers and men reported wounded and missing after the I
"' ' Â» issued by the War Office last night. Including all ranks, the Briti>h casualties in
last Friday's engagement were 144 killed. 743 wounded and 221 missing; total. 1 108.
Further stirring details of the battle are published to-day. "So terrible." one corre
spondent, "was at times the n>c from the Roer rifles that it seemed inconceivable that mortal man
could continue to advance in the face of it." Many deed? of heroism arc reported. Men returned
to the fire to bring: out wounded comrades and in one case a corporal succeeded in dressing the
injuries of two men under a murderous fusillade.
LONDON. Dec. 22.â There Is much
deep anxiety her*' as to the situa
tion In South Africa, and the pain--
ful nervous tension grows more
acute as the ominous silence con
tinues In regard to Generals Buller and
Methuen. .
Below all the enthusiasm evoked hr the
magnificent response to the call for volun
teer* Is a strong undercurrent of appre
hension, especially as to the condition of
the Klmbcrley relief column. It Is none
the less perc:~tible from efforts made, to
smother it by suggestions in which hope is
father to the thought that the War Office
ha." news from General Methuen which It
is concealing for mrategic reasons until
hi* supposed withdrawal to the Orange
River has been successfully completed.
This morning a well-authenticated re
port was received that news from General
White had rome through to the effect that
he was fully provided with ammunition
and food and able to hold out for some,
weeks more. This would greatly affect the
situation and render all haste on Bullcr's
part unnecessary.
The news that General Methuen has re
ceived a discourteous reply from General
Cronje has some Indirect value., as show-,
ing that his line of communication was
open on Saturday last, but the danirer of
his column being cut off has by no means
vanished. It certainly appears probable
that he will have to retreat. He is faced
by a superior force of Boers and is un
able to advance, while the Boers have al
ways in this war. sooner or later, operated
against the communication of the British
columns.
Should General Methuen be nit off by
the Boor force seizing his old positions
nt Gras Pan and Helm-nt, the British
might have another Ladysmlth on their
hands. Even the most sanguine enthusi
asts admit that with one Ladysmlth the
situation is critical enough.
If General Methuen falls back he will
be able to wait with perfect security for
the arrival of th.c sixth division, when
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1899.
the forward movement can b*> resumed.
and In view of the strength of the Boer
position a frontal attack does not prom
ise much, unless combined with a turn-
Ing movement, which means heavy rein
forcement*.
The silence maintained at the War Of
fice as to General. MÂ«*thuen's movements
mlsrht be with the Idea of keeping such
a backward step secret until completed.
Liord Roberts' letter to the American
and Canadian people received the fullest
Indorsement here.
The Dally Telegraph says: "Ther*Â» Is
nothing like adversity to test the value
of our friends, and we have already made
many significant discoveries in our re
cent mishaps. Perhaps we knew before
that we were not greatly loved on the
Continent, although the bitterness of
feeling aroused by our splendid isolation
is even greater than we thought, but in
all stronger contrast to this cold, carp
ing envy stands out the sympathy of
America and .magnificent devotion of
those distant lands which form proud
links in our chain of empire. It' Is well
that the general who has been called to
uphold the traditions of our army in
South Africa should call our. attention to
these lncontestible proofs that Great Brit
ain is never less alone than when she
seems to be isolated from Continental
friendships."
In default of any Important news of
Generals Buller and Methuen. public at
tention is directed to the question of the
possibility of the BoÂ«rs Importing food,
munitions of war and recruits by way of
the Portuguese port of Loure/izo Marques.
Many statements, some of them bearing
evidence it accuracy, have appeared In
the newspapers apparently confirmatory
of these reports. The passage of foreign
officers and- men into the Transvaal, how
ever, is most difficult to prove., and be
fore it car. be assured that quantities of
ammunition and food stuffs are passlnr
into the Transvaal f rom - Lourenzo Mar
o.iiez thÂ» facts must be absolutely sure.
England at present Is directing a \ery
keen and critical eye upon Delagoa Bayâ
more so than Is generally thought. I
found out to-day by meeting a Delagoa
Bay merchant many sidelights which bear
directly upon the present war. and ex
plain how well the Boers, having no lack
of money, are able to continue their in
sistent and ever increasing resistance. He
said: "The Portuguese officials of Delagoa
portâ and I know them wellâ are the most
corrupt lot In the world. When the war
commenced the Portuguese in Delagoa
Bay. like everybody else In the world,
considered victory a dead certainty for
the British, and therefore they at first
put a certain curb upon the Boer importa
tion of arms, recruits, etc. But since the
English reverses all that lias beer,
changed. They have turned around and
are entirely against us. Instead of help-
Ing the English in l>elagr. a Bay they have
made that port a base of supplies for the
Boers."
â¢'But." I asked, "how can they manage
that? Don't English warships patrol the
coast and stop contraband of war?"
"Yes," he said, "but what js a con
trol exercised outside of the three-mWo
limit? That does not make any differ
ence. Food munitions and recruits are
brought in aim openly. The arms are
concealed in the lowest part of the tl:ip
and covered with tor.9 of stuff. Examine
such ships out at sea? Why. it would take
three weeks to examine them properly.
As for recruits, they come in the same
-hips as passengers, waiters or sailors
it does not matter how. They are lan led
and received with ovations. and enthusi
asm. After this open-armed reception
they are espedlttOVSly forwarded to Pre
toria, arms and all. They come as -ivij.
tans, they leave as soldiers.' All Europe
is a recruiting ground for â Â«ier

"Who recrutta them?" 1 inquired.

she has got to buy or occupy Delagoa

The Dally Mall in discussing thÂ« matter
says that "European complications might

with regard to Portuguese breaches of

HORRORS OF THE WARFARE
WAGED IN SOUTH AFRICA
Correspondents Tell of the Terrible Slaughter
and Bravery Among the British Troops at
Nicholsens Nek and Elangslaagte.
LONDON. Dec. Letters from
British officers and soldiers light
ing in the Transvaal and lengthy
descriptions from war correspond
ents that (liter into print through
the mails teem with thrilling and pa
thetic incidents. Writing. to his mother
a young ottlcer of the Manchesters,
wounded In one of the first engagements,
related that while he lay at night on the
hillside expecting to die. bleeding from a
wound in his thigh and shivering with
cold, there stumbled over him a "Tommy
of my company named Rogers." This
"Tommy" quickly whipped off his own
overcoat, placed it around the boy ofllcer
and laying do â¢ n put his arms around
him and for the rest of that long, cold
night kept him "beautifully warm."
The Times correspondent gives a
graphic account and explanation of the
British disaster at Nicholson's Nek.
where Carleton's column, consisting of
six companies of the Royal Irish Fusi
liers, four and a half companies of the
Gloucestershire Regiment and No. 10
Mountain Battery, surrendered.
â¢â¢Two hours before daybreak," says this
correspondent, "while the column was in
an enclosed country, either a shot was
lirod or a bowlder rolled Into the battery.
The mules stampeded and easily broke
away from their half-asleep drivers. They
came back on the Gloucestershire Regi
ment, the advance party of whom tlrc<l
into the mass, believing in the darkness
that It was an attack. This added to the
chaos, the ranks were broken by the
frenzied animals and they dashed through
the ranks of the rear guard, carrying the
lirst und second serve ammunition ani
mals with them. It became a hopeless
piinlc The animals, wild with the shout
ing and the turmoil, tore down the Nullah
into the darkness and the last that ami
heard of them was the sound of amÂ«
munition boxes and punters as they were
splintered against the bowlders. The hub
bub of these few momenta was sufficient
to have alarmed the enemy. By a strenu
ous effort the officers Bucceedwd in gutting
the men again under control, and when
daylight came they *elzed the tlrst posi
tion which presented itself and which was
about two miles short of the original goal.
They were forced to take advantage of
tht lirst kopje, as Boer scouts Were ail
urounu them and the day was ushered in
with desultory Uring. It was a sorry po
sition which they had chosen and the
men were in a sorry plight. All their
reserve ammunition was gone and though
they had saved pieces of the screw guns
they were not able with these pieces to
VMich up a tingle mounting.
â¢'From Â«.irli. .â¢! daybreak Boer scouts
were reconnoitering and about â¢ o'clock
mounted Boer* could be seen galloping in
small groups to the cover or me bill west.
Strong parties of mounted men took posi
tions on the tar side of the two bills, com
manding me Kopje from them. About 9
0 clock iheso two parties had crowned tho
hills and opened a heavy :ir at short
range right down upon tno plateau, Our
men made a plucky attempt to return
this lire, but It was Impossible. They
were under a cross lire From two direc
tion*, dank and rear. The two companies
of Gloucestershires, holding the self-con
tained ridge, were driven from their shel
ter, and as they crossed the open on the
low plateau were terribly mauled, the men
falling In groups. The Boers on the west
bad not yet declared themselves, but
about SOOO marksmen climbed to the posi
tion which the two companies of the
Gloucestershire!* had Just vacated. These
men absolutely raked the plateau and it
was then that the men were order to tuko
cover on the steep reverse of the kopje.
As soon as thÂ«Â« enemy realised this move,
the men on the western hill teemed onto
the summit and opened upon our men as
they lay on the slope. They wore abso
lutely hemmed in, and what hud com
menced as a skirmish seemed about to be
come a butchery. The grim order was
passed around, 'Oh, faugh-a-ballaghs, as
your bayonets and die like men.' There
was the clatter of steel, the moment of
suspense, and then the 'cease lira' bound
ed. Again and again It sounded, but the
Irish Fusiliers were loath to accept the
call and continued firing for many min
utes. Then It was unconditional surren
der and the men laid down their arms.
The correspondent at Ladysmlth of the
same paper, describing the battlefield of
Elandslaagte realistically details the
horrors of war. He writes:
"The battlefield, as it stood on Sun
day, conveyed sufficient proof of the se
verity of the tire. The wounded had been
removed by daylight, but the burial par
ties had not arrived to perform the last
duties to toe dead. The men lay there
as they had fallen, a sad. pathetic tribute
to the courage of the British soldier. Wo
followed this . tragic trailâ Highlanders,
Manchester* and mounted volunteers lay
indiscriminately grouped. Then solitary
Hgures under the stones showed how lit
tle the cover had availed them. There
were places where wire fences had Imped
ed the advance. Hero, the carnage had
been great and one bravo fellow, stooped
in death, was cut off as he strove to
wrench a post from its foundations. 'In
the skyline of the tableland the dead lay
thickest, there belnjr the main spot where
the attack had been checked, but the
white flag was already there and strings
of coolies wore dltrglng the trench which
so often Is the soldier*! resting place.
"We rode back to the Boer positionâ the
little kopje upon which Srhlel and Sis
twenty-thr*? men had made their last
stand.' The bodies of the fifteen that had
fallen of this little band wore grouped as
death had taken them. Some lay with
heads sunken on their rifle stocks, fight
ing to the end. Another had placed his
hat upon a prominent stone 'five yards
away and died with his fingers pressing
a charge into his magazine. What re
mained of the. laager was the litter of
shell fire. Tents wore torn and burned,
wagons splintered and overturned, food
stuffs, dead horses and explosives lay in
wrecked piofiislon. There remained no
doubt that our shell fire had laved upon
the position with full effect, and cne
could only marvel that the Boers had
stood to their Rims so long. But, as one
of the wounded prisoners told me later
In the day. there was no room to retreat
the extended flies of the Manchester regi
ment, overlapping the reverse of the
kopje, sweeping the northern footpath
while the rain of shrapnel destroyed
every living thing on the western slopes.
And the scene at the farm house, nest
ling at tho foot Of the ridge, on the far
Bide, bore out this statement. It was here
that the Boers had brought their horses
for cover Hi.d carcasses lay piled on every
side. The slaughter among tho horr.es
must have been almost as heavy as that
of the men."

knocked (run and carriage on to the veldt
and woun-lod several of the seamen. But
the men were not a whit beaten.
The Pall Mall Gazette's correspondent
describes Winston Churchill's conduct on
this occasion as follows:
"A party volunteers, consisting princi
pally of plate layers, etc., led by Winston i
Churchill, who behaved throughout with
most heroic courage, succeeded In placing
the rails. â¢ Mr. Churchill had previously
assisted in carrying In no less than twenty
men under a terrible fire. Some idea of
the accuracy of the enemy's fire and i f
Mr. Churchill's courage may be obtained
by narrating the fact that' a Boer shÂ«-il
burst in front of Mr. Churchill, killing
two men on each side of him. Our wound
ed were dotting the veldt on each side.
The continued rifle fire and the weird
Bound of the quick-firers added to the hor
rors of the situation. At last the line was
clear and the engine, with one carriage
of the armored train, was enabled to re
turn to Frere, leaving Captain Haldane
and party fiercely engaged. The Boers
gave it a passing salvo of shells, hitting
the tender and nearly derailing the train
a second time." â  â -â¢-
The Daily Graphic's correspondent, de
scribing a visit to the hulk of the Penel
ope at Somers Bay, where the Boer pris
oners are confined, undertaken In the
company of Colonel Stowe. the United
States Consul General, writes:
"The majority of the prisoners are
sleek, contented and Indifferent. They
told me they thought the war would be a
picnic; that they would rash Natal before
tho imperial troops would arrive; that
England would be involved In foreign
complications, and that they would be
able to dictate terms from Pietermarltt
burg and Durban. They thought to view
the Cape peninsula as conquerors, not
from a prison ship. Colonel pchlel steps
with difficulty. His wound in the thigh Is
nearly healed, but he still requires the use
of a stick. Bchiel is a typical soldier of
fortuneâ grizzly-grey hair, cropped close,
aggressive military mustache, shrewd
blue eyes, a thick neck, a figure still un
mistakably active, but tending to stout
ness. As to bearing, he is a genial man
of the world. He Introduced us to somo
of his brother officers, including Captain
Van Lcggelo, a benevolent, good-looking
cosmopolitan of kindly expression and
modest meln. who told us that he was
born In Holland, educated In Germany
and had a sister In St. Louis."
INTERESTS THE PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
President States That He Will Be
Present at the Launching of
the Ohio Here.
WASHINGTON, â  Dec. 21.-Senator Per
kins to-day introduced A. T. Vogelsang
and wife of San Francisco to President
McKlnlcy. In the course of the. conver
sation the President remarked that the
weather was very fin*-, and both Senator
Perkins and Mr. Vogelsang replied that
It was typical California weather. The
President laughingly replied:
"That is the usual reply of Californ
ians."
Mr. Vogelsang then asked the President
why he did not accept the Invitation of
California to visit the State and verify
these statements. The President replied
that he would have a chance to make
comment on their statements when the
battleship Ohio was launched at San
Francisco, as he would be one of the
party present at that time.
The members of the. Committee on Ter
ritories of both houses of Congress leave
to-night for an extended trip through
Arizona, New Mexico and California.
Senator Perkins was invited to accom
pany them, but on account of pressing
business was unable to go.
Senator Perkins and Representative
â Waters to-day called. on the Agricultural
Department and on behalf of the citizens
of I."* Angeles asked the Government to
accept Griffith Park In that city and to
establish an agricultural experimental
station there. They both have received
letters from the Mayor of Los Angeles
asking them to urge the department to
accept the park. This will require a
special act of Congress and they desired
the department to recommend It. The
Secretary will talk the matter over with
them in the morning, Both are confident
(hat the proposiuoa will be accepted. 1
I Senator Perkins had a conference with
1 Commissioner of Internal Revenue Wil

offices in California and was convinced
that they were In as good If not better

shipping interests of the same section
were also present.
At the evening of the hearing C. E. Gill
of New York, chairman of the omc.al
U*Â«i:ricauon Committee, said the rait
roacs were without knowledge of the per
sons who had requested the hearing and
asked that they be called on to Â»tate
wherein the proposed changes were un
just.
Mr. Gill maintained that the proposed
advances in freight rates were due to the
:r.ci^ased cobt or railroad plant* and
maintenance, and the advances had been
applied to classes of lieignts that could

to Increase the rates.
Mr. Gill replied, as h* h^Â»l previously
dnno. that in the rates on articles which
had adxanfvd they could well stand thÂ«=m

thÂ» prartic- Â«jf th* committee to accord
such hearing*. Ak chairman, he heard
tho protests and communicated their sub

thÂ«Â» Proposed classification had not been
considered by the coramltu-e and would
not be until after the classification had

At thÂ» openlnsj nf ihe affrr.oon session
XVUIIam R- Oorwln^. representing tho

wnuM conÂ«*nt to this proposition he an
ticlpateÂ«l ni trouble. As no representa
tive- of the railrcarts present had authority
to accept Mr. Kellv's prr>rÂ»os!tiÂ«in it went
by drfault. Mr. Gill, who was on the
stand during trie rnnmlr.g session, did not
approve of Mr. Kelly's proposition that
the classlflc.iTinns should not to into ef

the railroads of added revenues for three

F. S. Monnett. Attorney General of

of shipping petroleum, evidently endeav

to the effect that the Standard Oil Com

RESCUED FROM
LIGHTNER MINE
Three of the Four Men
Taken Out Alive.
F?ecl*l D!Â»p*trh to ThÂ» Call.
STOCKTON. Dec. 21.â The latest partic
ulars of the disaster in the Llchtnermlne
at Angels Camp are to the effect that all
the imprisoned miners, with the excep- i
tion of Fisher, have been taken out aJlve. j
Whltton. who was taken out last night, i
is still suffering from a badly crushed arm j
and numerous bruises, but will recover,
and his arm will bo saved. John Me- I
Kewin was more fortunate. He was lib- i
crated early this morning. Though he I
was found all doubled up he, was not in- '
jured beyond a few bruises, and is all
tfght to-day. F. E. McNair is the worst
Injured of the living. One of his arras ,
was caught between a large rock and '
some of the timbering, with the result
that It was crushed off between the wrist
and the eibow, and amputation was found
to be necessary. The operation was per
formed this morning.
The. bedy of Klsher has not yet been re
covered, but Foreman Sechell declares
that he knows just where the body is. He
expresses the fear, however that there is
little hope of finding Fisher alive. The I
rescuing party is still at work removing
the obstructions.
Fisher was about &"> years cf ax* and
leaves a widow and thrÂ«?e married daugh
ters.
It is believed that the cause of the cave
wns the recent heavy rains, which so
moistened the ground that the eight feet
beyond the timbering, being unsupported,
caved in. There were nine men at work
near the point at the time, and It is re
garded as miraculous mat only one was
killed. The five men working 'under the
timbers, with tht? exception of one who
was ?Â»ruck by a rock, escaped without a
scratch.

SAN JOSE. Dec 21.-Californias flf - I
tltrth birthday was celebrated in a
regal way here to-day by the old
pioneers and their sons and daugh
ters. :.nd this city, the birth
piace of State government, was erowdr
ed with thousands of visitors. People i
from all over the State came to I
pay homage to Miss California. There i
are men present who were here be- !
fore the discovery of cold, those who i
came to fight the Mexicans and others i
who cam-? with the rush for the precious â 
metal, and these all joined hands to-day i
to celebrate the ha!f-cer.tury mark In the '
great State's history. They were ably as- !
slsted by the Native Sons and Daughters,
to whose, shoulders must soon fall the re- \
sponsibility cf honoring State events. Alt \
these fortes met in a. grand reunion to
day.
The early morning trains from San
Francisco, Oakland and other parts of â .
Central California brought thousands of \
visitors. The entire county also turned '
out. and when the great street pageant
started there were fully ten thousand vis- >
liors on the streets. With the exception j
of the rose carnival. It is the largest
crowd that ever gathered here.
A reign of cheer and hospitality pre
valla throughout the city and San Joseana ,
an- doing everything possible to make me :
visitors happy. Business has bevn virtu- !
ally suspendt-d and time given over to the
celebration. To cap these delightful con- i
dltions It was a sunny California winter '
day ai:d thero was no need of wraps.
fully one thousand pioneers are pres- j

the greatest gathering of them ever hÂ«ld
and the like will never occur again. They j
were entertained at Sleeper Hall to-day .
by the Santa Clara County Pioneer Soci
ety. Four hundred bat down to an elab
orate banquet. A general reunion fol- i
lowed, at which the pioneers were com- I
ing and going all day. General Bldwell I
was a conspicuous itgure there.
A: Native Sons" Hall op*n house was '
also kept, and Native Sons and Daughters
did the receiving.
The ladies' reception committee at thÂ«
Courthouse entertained lavishly. a
s-tring orchestra discoursed music during
the day and evening and there was a
merry crowd present most of the time.
A great many of the visitors are being ;
entertained at private homes. Different
societies are- also looking alter their fel
low members, and never before has the
Garden City so lavishly entertained. The
Nevada State band and Third Artillery- !
men are not being overlooked.
Among the piont-ers are many who have
not seen one another for years, and these
little meetings have added an additional
interest to the celebration. *
A steady stream poured In and out of <
the Capitol building to-day. The repre- !
wntation of the original State House Is !
an attractive feature. Inside a number ;
of curios are represented. J. \V. Ganong

To-days festivities made the jubilee a
success, and th*> celebration will end to- '

It has proved a harvest for fakers and '

INTRIGUES IN
BERLIN BREWING
Ministers Use the Press
to Reply.
â 
BERLIN. Dec. 21.â Th* sharp attacks
made of late upon Imperial ami Prussian
Ministers soem to be bringing about a
change in political customs, as the Minis
ters* are replying through the newspapers
to their assailant?. Only a few days ago
Dr. yon Mlquel answered over his own
signature the charge that he was the
Prussion Minister responsible for the dis
missal of the landrath who had voted
against the canal bill. To-day's sensa
tion is Prince Hohenlohe's reply to his
critics through a semi-official article In
the Norde Deutsche Allegemeine :tun*r.
All this is Interpreted as showing that
very dark Intrigues are brewing behind
the scenes If such extraordinary steps are
necessary.
The Imperial Chancellor's article has
not satisfied the press in the main. The
Agrarian organs are especially dissatis
fied, declaring that the writer has not ren
dered a service to Prince Hohenlohe. The
Kreuz Zeltung commends the < aim tone of
the article, but declines to comment fur
ther. Even the Berliner Post refuses to

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 22. 1899.
GRATITUDE HOSTAGE
FOR LAWTON'S HOME
Payment Made Certain by the
Quick Response for Funds.
Arrangements Made to Accord All Military
Honors to the Late Hero
General.
Special Dispatch to The OalL
_. was notified yesterday by General Corbin that I had been
1 placed on a committee to raise funds for Mrs. Lawton. I propose
I to put the matter personally to my friends and to the people of
*this coast through the public press, feeling confident of their
hearty co-operation in this deserving charity. A bank in San Fran
. Cisco will be asked to become custodian of the funds. I anticipate
from the patriotic and generous people of this coast the liberal re
response they always make when appealed to in a worthy cause.
| WILLIAM R. BH AFTER.
> Bakersfleld, December 21. 1809.
From the War Department comes the news that a fund will be
[ raided to pay of? the mortgage on the farm in Sao Bernardino County,
where General Lawton hoped to end his days. Already appointments
have been made to form a committee to collect the necessary amount,
t and General Shafter, commanding this department of the army, has been
- made the committeeman from this coast.
The farm is a little oranpe prove of twelve acres lying at the foot of
> Mount San Bernardino, purchased in the name of Mrs. Lawton in 1804.
'' The price was $8500, which is the amount of the mortgage, but since
its purchase it has been improved and cultivated, until now it is worth
> $17,000 The improvements have been paid for. however, hut the purchase
price still remains as a lien upon the property, and it is this that a grate
ful people wishes to remove. It is not intended that the mortgage shall
> be paid v a matter of charity. No one would have resented such an
attitude quicker than Lawton himself, but it is fitting that the home
â¢ the gallant soldier loved m> well should be secured to his widow when
> h<- has KÂ°ne. There is little else the people can do, for the Government
will pension Mr<. Lawton, so she can occupy a position in keeping with
j the fame of her gallant husband, and nothing remains but sympathy and
> condolences and just such a delicate attention as is implied iii the paying
oil of the mortgage on the hero's home and complete for him one of
> the aims of his lifeâ a peaceful sp^t tor his wife and himself to end their
> days. That he cannot now look out for it himself makes it possible for
â¢ the people to <io it for him. for his death in the sen-ice of the flag
> leaves the fortunes of his family m the hands of the people as his own
> memory 1- in 'heir hearts.
There iÂ« everything in the way it is done, however. There is a dif
ference between honoring a hero"? memory and ostentatiously parading
â  tact; between aiding the expression of a people's gratitude and let
â¢ t in^ (very one know just who is doing it; between honest assistance
' and self advertisement It must be a spontaneous gift â one that comes
[ from t! well as the hand and takrs its greatest value not from
â  the gift itsdi but from the meaning of it
The only reward for heroism such as the gallant Lawton showed
, lies in the gratitude of thr nation and the sense of a duty well done. Fear
â¢ras fon irton's life. He braved death a hundred times, not
alone in the island wars, but among the Indians, and when thi> was over
he had promised himself a reÂ«.t. He did want to go to South Africa, for
wherever there w.i- a tight there Lawton wished to be. but. yielding to
Â«pf his wife, he promised that the present war would end it.
and then he would go back to the little farm they had bought and'
he would spend the remainder of h\< days in peace. In carrying out the
lier's plan for his (amity the people can show no truer proof of their
appreciation of the noble sacrifice of his life.

WASHINGTON*. Dec 21.â The following
general order announcing to the army

, cally continuous and movt eventful service In
the Held until he fell, en December IS. 1599,
pierced by an Insurgent bullet while leading
his traopa near San Mateo on the Island of
Luion. The swift and resistless movement of
his column up the nio Qrande and across the
northern boundary of the plain of Central Lu
zon, which had Just been completed, was the
chief factor In the destruction of the Insurgent
power, and was the crowning achievement of
his arduous life. He fell in the fullness of his
powers, in the joy of conflict. In the conscious
ness of assured victory. He leaves to his com
rades and his country the memory and the ex
ample of dauntless courage, of unsparing devo
tion to duty, of manly character and of high
qualities of command, which Inspired his troops
with his own Indomitable spirit.
The flag will be placed at half-staff and thir
teen minute guns will be fired at every military
post and nation on the day after the receipt
of this order, and the usual badges of mournlnr
will be worn for thirty days.

NO TROUBLE IN
SAMOAN ISLES
Sensational Reports Not
Corroborated.
â¢
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 â The following
statement Is 'made by the German otQ
cJala here:
A press telegram of the Uth Inst. from Apia,
via Auckland, reports that the German Consul
In Apia had solemnly proclaimed the pending
annexation of Upolu and Sav&lt by Germany
to a number of Hamoan officials on board the
German man-of-war, and that on the same da)'
of the announcement he hoisted the German
flag on the Supreme Court building.
This does not cover the reports received
In LSerlin from the German Consul In
Apia. and. according to the Instructions which
he has received from Berlin, It seems absolutely
untrue.
The German Consul likewise wired on. the
13th lnÂ«t., but he pimply states that certain
Tunu chiefs have refused to pay the head tax
Imposed by the three Consuls; hence they had
been ordered to leave the districts by the thir
teen chiefs. The three Consuls have Instructed
the thirteen chiefs to send the aggressors to
Apia for trial. This has been agreed upon.
The State Department has had no mos
sage from our Consul at Apia to confirm
the reports of fresh trouble In Samoa and
this fact is regarded as sutllclent to show !
that any slight disturbance that may have
occurred has been much exaggerated in
the report.
The officials are confident that whatever
trouble may occur will not be charg<*abl*
to the German officials, as the German
Government Is aulte as anxious as our
own that the pending treaty providing
for a permanent settlement of the whole
Samoan question shall not be endangered
at this critical stage.
BANKERS PREDICT
BIG GOLD SHIPMENTS
Certain Firms Assert That the Con
ditions Indicate That $5,000,000
Will Be Taken.
NEW YORK. Dec. 21.â Sterling bankers
predicted to-day numerous gold engage
ments for Saturday, but* all said It was
Impossible to estimate with accuracy how
much the shipments would amount to.
One firm report 1 that It might ship from
$500,000 to $1,000,000, as to-morrow's require
ments suggested, and In other quarters
it was believed that at least $0,0u0,000 alto
gether would go out. At present rates the
margin of profit on gold exports would
be small, it was paid, but the demand for
the metal abroad was sufficient to make
"special transactions" profitable at this
time. It was said to-day that Heidelberg,
Elchelhelmer & Co. and Mull.r. Schall A
Co. might each ship $500,000.
A well-known marine underwriter said
Insurance would be obtainable to-morrow
for as much gold as local bankers cared
to send by the Etruria. Although $5,000.
000 might be a large sum to risk on any
one steamer, twice that liability would
probably be assumed by Insurance com
panies if banking Interests demanded It.

CHRISTMAS WEEK
AT WHITE HOUSE
Congressmen Call on the
President.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 21.â Many Sena
tors and Representatives called upon the
President to-day to pay their respects and
extend their Christmas greetings before
leaving for their homes to spend the holi
day season. Among them was Represen
tative Richardson of Tennessee, the Dem
ocratic leader of the House, who was ac
companied by Representative McClellan
of New York and Representative Stalling**
of Alabama. The President Is very cor
dial in responses to these evidences of
goodwill. Ho appears to be enjoying ex
ceptionally good health. No extensive
preparations are being made for the
Christmas celebration at the Executive
Mansion this year, owing to the State of
Mrs. McKinley's health, and the day prob
ably will be a very quiet one.
Miss Grace McKinley and Miss Sarah
Duncan, nieces of the President, will be
guests at the Whit.- House during the
holidays. Abner McKinley and his wife
also will be here. Tim White House stew
ard long ago ceased to glvo himself any
concern about the Christmas turkey. For
man? years the fattest. Juiciest bird in
Rhode Island has arrived with th*> com
pliments of the season. Many boxes havn
already reached the White House con
taining gifts for the President and Mr*
McKinley and a considerable number of
presents are already on their way to their
destination from thÂ«Â« White House.
Most of Mrs. McKinley's gifts are ex
quisite products of her own handiwork.
I^ast year Mrs. sfcKtnlejr went to New
York before the holidays and purchased
many little things for th* servants and
White House attaches, but this year her
illness prevented her from making the
trip. It Is the custom to remember every
married employe of the White House with
a big. fat turkey and every unmarried
attache with a suitable present.
STORIES OF THE DUKE OF YORK
A Brace of Them Picked Up in Lon-
don Last Summer.
"I heard some rather good stories about
the present Duke of York when I was In
I/Ondon this summer." paid 11. R. West
cott of Plttsburg to a New York Tribune
reporter. "At family luncheon at Windsor
one day Prince George of Wales, then a
small boy, misbehaved, and his grand
mother put him under the table In punish
ment. No complaint was made by the
youthful offender, and after a certain time
had elapsed the Queen asked: 'Will you
be a good boy now, Georgle?' 'Not yet.
grandma,' came the reply. After thÂ« lapse
of another period of time the same query
and reply were asaln made, but at the
third Inquiry the response came: 'Yes. 11l
be a good boy now. grandma.' and per
mission to come from under the table be
ing accorded him, out marched England's
future King; but. sad to relate, as naked
as the day he was born, he having
stripped himself during his enforced se
clusion beneath the family board.
"At another time, when they were
grown older, Prince George and the late
Duke of Clarence, who was familiarly
known as "Collars and Cuffs,' were In the
navy and at some Brazilian port. There
they met some English people, and Prince
George was somewhat pronounced In his
attentions to one of the young women
This the Duke of Clarence thought was
not as it should be. and that the difference
in position made such attentions on the
part of Prince George wrong. lie accord
ingly remonstrated with his younger
brother, who stood it passively for a time
but finally turned to him with. 'Oh. you
go whistle "God Save Your Grand
mother' and leave me to attend to my
own affairs." " . .*

Presumably our 90-cent hats are too low priced
to be suitable for Christmas presents.
Maybe they are what you want when buying for
yourself, especially if your allowance is rather dimin-
ished after Christmas buying.
But likely they would make good presents after
all, if you wish to give something worth $1 $0, for
that is the value of the hats.

MAINE VICTIMS
ABE DISINTERRED
Three Bodies May Be
Missing.
DISCREPANCY IN THE LIST
LESS RECOVERED THAN THE
NUMBER IN THE ROSTER.
Chaplain Chidwick Believes That
Merely a Clerical Error Wai
Committed and No Bodies
Lost.
Special Dl-patcr: â¢
HAVANA. Doc. 21.â The removal of the
dead of the Maine was not accompanic 1
by any ceremonies over the bodies ns,
newly coffined, they were placed in l!.Â»
mortuary chapel of the cemetery until r. ;
was completed. At 10 o'clock last night
ten wagons formed â  procession carrying
151 coffins to the Machlna wharf, passing
through unfrequented streets. The bodies
reached thÂ© wharf at 11:20 under a stronc
guard from the battleship Texas. were
placed aboard two steam lighters before
daylight and wen taken to the warship
at 6 a. in., which left here at 10 a. to.
All the remains were thoroughly disin
fected.
A difference was found between the
number Of coffins interred on Chaplain
Chldwick'B list, which was 154, and the
actual number of cofllns exhumed. Search
was made through all twenty-two grav.vj
In which the coAns were buried, but the
missing three coffins were not found.
Father Chid wick said the difference coul.l
be explained by a clerical error at the
time of interring, as he was very busy at
the wharf giving instructions and Identi
fying the bodies, and could not superin
tend every detail. It was also quit- pos
sible that after ordering portions of two
different bodies to be placed In different
cofllns they had carelessly been ; 'it In
one coffin. It was also Impossible for
Father Chldwlck to superintend the actu.il
placing of all the coffin* in th.- graves,
owing to the haste necessitated by the de
composition of the bodies. He adds that
the list gives two bodies as unaccounted
for. The superintendent of the cemetery,
who burled the bodies, says that owing to
all the remains not being burled the samÂ«
day It is quite possible that a mistake
was made in the counting. He was cer
tain no bodies were lost. Captain Orten
also says he docs not believe any bodies
went astray.
Persons who were desirous of photo
graphing the proceedings at the cemetery
were not allowed to do so. The work w*s
conducted quietly and decorously under
the direction of Father Id wick. The old
coffins were carried away and burned.

Cheering cÂ«Â«i has been received from
Washington In private letters concerning'
tiie outlook for the inbatltaUon of a >*oac
drydock at Mar* Island fcr the timber
structure which !t was attglÃMXtf planned
to build there for naval us*. Two bills
hive already been Introduced In refer
ence to the matter, on* la the Senate
and one in the Hoese The Senate bill,
cf which mention has been made in the
special dispatches to The Call frcm
Washington, was introduced by Senator
Perkins. The House bill, which Is ident
ical in terms, was introduce b7 Coa
rressman Butler. The text cf the Per
kins till provides that the provisions of
the act making appropriations for the na
val service for the nscai year ending June
X. % . !Â£Â». relating to the construction of
drydocks. etc., be further modified so that
the SecrÂ»Â»tary of the Navy may. in his
discretion, contract for the construction

and at ilare Island. CaL. tn addition to

and in such cases the limit of the coat
of docJt3 for Mar*? Island and League
Island Is so far modined that the total in
creased ccst for the two drydacka afore
said shall not exceed JTOO.Om).
The Perkins bill was referred to the
Senate Committee en Naval Affairs, of
which both Senator Perkins and Senator
Penrcse cf Pennsylvania are members.
It has been previously mentioned that
the Pennsylvania Congressional delega
tion was supporting the proposition to
construct only stone drydocks. having la
view the work at League Island. Hav

are known to fc-e favorable to th-? meas

and Mart Island in the bL.I Is considered
to be a jrood t-injr. for It secures tne

ter, are Metcaif cf California and Butier
of Pennsylvania. ThtÂ« insures two
votes tn the House Committee far a fa
vorable report.
The demand for itone drydocks at all
the navy -yards where there are drydocks
to construct has been seconded by tne
leading engineering journals of the East
ern States. The Engineering News and
American Railway Journal, published at
New York, has declared that "the ma
sonry dock is in every way better adapted
to its purpese than the timber dc<k." and
also makes the statement of fact, not
cemmeniy understood, that a rreat dan
ger to 3. drydock is the upward pressure
cf the soil water. Against this pressure
thÂ« stone dock is superior to the timber
dock ca account cf Its weizht. This
weight !s alone Â«uf2cient to hold down

DIVISION IN CANADA.
r\ QUITE remarkable development of the Boer
/ A w.ir is the appearance of divided sentiment in
* *â  ( nnada. The liberal French Canadians are
quite free in their expressions of antagonism, and
are not without allies among their fellow citizens of
English blood. Professor Goldwin Smith has de
clared h-ni^i: to friends in England as an active
opponent of the South African aggression, and to a
friend in California has written: "The end of the
British empire seems to me certain. It will be that of
c empires before it, notably of that Spanish em
pire of which we have just seen the final collapse."
The ancient empires were in decay unobserved by
their people. When the measures regarded as tending
to permanence of their existence were taken history
finds in the means used the inoculation with fatal dis
ease, which finally destroyed that which they were
intended to preserve.
In these days, therefore, guided by past examples,
the philosopher is able to diagnose the case of em
pire better than in other times.
The spread of empire requires the acquisition of
unwilling people, of alien and diverse races, and
where climatic conditions give to these physical per
sistence and deny it to their conquerors a poison is
taken into the imperial body which finally destroys it.
A year ago the idea prevailed that other races being
moribund, and other nations in decay, the two great
branches of the Anglo-Saxon race owed to humanity
the duty of possessing at once the estates of the
feeble, and there were high dreams of a division of
the world between England and the United States,
inst this iridescent reverie the best thought of
r.d has now taken up arms. Englishmen in the
temperate zone, who value their relation to the eni
rehensive of its speedy fall through an
unwieldy expansion which secures the enmity of the
world and weakens imperial power of resistance. The
doctrine that the weak have no rights to be respected
by the Itrong is now clearly seen by thinkers to lead
to the weakening of the strong, and to the ultimate
overthrow of all that strength has guarded that is
beneficial to mankind. No wonder that Goldwin
Smith, Herbert Spencer and the guild of British
thinkers are sounding the note of alarm.
In the Uniteji States a selfish and imperial policy,
transformed from the altruism of our Spanish war,
has been notably opposed by the scholars and phil
osophers. Against them stand the politicians, who
consider not the past nor the future. In their brief
day they reach for profits, power and glory, and are
careless of the distressing difficulties they are creating
for the generations to come.
Here there is a cheerful prospect of a reaction, in
which the still, small voice of reason as it is uttered
by the wise will be heard above the bugles and the
roar of guns. But in England the imperial habit is
fixed. It is an appetite that grows with what it
on, and an instinct which reaches out continually for
new victims of its greed. The somber forebodings of
Goldwin Smith may be realized b< fore this generation
pass< nd the British empire may fall, carry
ing with it the vast benefits to mankind which have
ited with the English race. If the land of the
world were unpeopled and all parts of the planet
were equally adapted to the perpetuation of the
Anglo-Saxon race from generation to generation the
universal empire of that race might be more substan
tial than a dream. But no political policy can over
come the resistance of nature. It is quite likely that
the Bri'ish empire, by violation of the everlasting
principle laid down by Mr. Blame that forcible an
:on, carrying with it an indignant and hostile
people, is wrong, is in danger of disintegration.
Senator Hoar, although he ranks as one of the
' foremost authorities in the Senate, was not appointed
on either of the committees organized to deal with
our "colonial possessions." Fortunately the Senator's
influence is uot of the kind confined to a committee
room, and when the time comes to settle the :
growing out of our occupation of Cuba and the Phil
ippines he will be heard by the whole country.
CtiflMÃEÃLfllN'S NEW SONG.
WHEN he was urging his aggressive demands
upon the Boers Mr. Chamberlain, for the pur
pose of winning over the British public to sup
port him in his jingoism, spoke contemptuously of
the strength of the Transvaal and scouted nil sug
gestions that the "handful of farmers" would dare to
resist with arms the power of the British empire.
Kven after the war began he continued to hold forth
jauntily upon the subject and gave encouragement to
the popular belief that Buller would make something
like a holiday march across the country, and after
dictating peace to the conquered rebels would enjoy
his Christmas dinner at Pretoria.
It was not long, however, before the southward
â¢sweep of the Boers put an end to his jauntiness. He
taw the British troops in South Africa shut up in the
intrenchments at Maftking, Kimberley and Lady
smith, and the victorious "farmers," as he called them,
making 'a successful invasion of Natal and Cape
Colony. He perceived that it is impossible to keep
the truth from the British public even by the most
rigid censorship, and, being too astute a politician not
to know how to adapt himself and his speeches to a
change in the situation, he has altered the tone of his
orator)' and is now trying to rouse the war spirit of
the country by describing the contest as one which
wiil demand the exercise of all the patriotism of the
people.
In his recent speech at Leicester he is reported to
have said: "But this is a great war upon which we
have entered. It is not a small task that this country
lias, not for the first time in its glorious history, un
dertaken. We are told that the Transvaal is a weak
power. Weakness in war depends upon many con
siderations. It is not merely a question of numbers
or of wealth. It is a question of local circumstance,
of position, of methods of warfare. At the time of an
unwarranted and extraordinary and insolent aggres
sion of attack upon her Majesty's territories, the
Transvaal state was by far the greatest military power
in South Africa. For years it has been preparing, as
we now know, for this contingency, and when the
war broke out, in numbers of men. in its resources, in
its armament, it altogether outnumbered and out
v.riÂ«hed anything that this country could possib'7 do
for many weeks to come. You must bear in mind
that in this war we are 6000 miles and more from the
country in which we have to operate, and when our
troops land in that country thÂ»*y are 1500 miles by lani
from their ultimate objective."
Since that speech was made the situation has be
come even more gloomy for the British. Gttacre,
Methuen and Buller have been successively defeated.
So far from being able to relieve the beleaguered
I'.ritMi garrisons the forces of these generals are
themselves in danger. The scene of the conflicts is
far away from the frontier of the Transvaal, and thÂ«
battles are being fought upon British soil. In Nan!
the Boers have pushed their march half way to the
coast, and they have done nearly as well in Cape
Colony. All ideas of an easy movement through the
Tranbvaal have been abandoned, and General Buller
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1899.
who went to the front with a plan of a straight march
forward, has been superseded in command by Gen
eral Roberts.
The one satisfactory feature of the war to the Brit
ish is that the jingo Government has at last realized
the difficulty of the war and has taken steps to put
forth the full strength of the empire. The best gen
erals in the British service are to have command, and
every soldier she can bring forward from her wide
extended empire will be sent to serve under them.
The Boers will have to meet on the field of battle
men from even- quarter of the globe. They will be
gathered not only from the British Islands, but from
Canada, from Australia and from India. Mr. Cham
berlain no longer underrates his enemy, and the only
question is whether he has recovered his reason too
late.
The fund for the benefit of the family of General
Lawton ought to be provided without urging. Why
should any citizen of means need argument to prove
that it is a privilege to be able to contribute to such a
fund?
IT is evident that if Mr. Bryan have his way the
next Democratic platform will indorse all the
economic vagaries that can be gathered together.
The great opposition to railroads in this country
is based upon the belief that they unduly interfere in
politics, and this belief is justified by certain aggra
vated instances of such interference. Whereupon, in
stead of instituting measures to prevent the offensive
nee in politics of tho-e artificial persons called
corporations, the pseudo reformer? plan a campaign
based upon a prophecy of important economic effects
which are to follow Government ownership and oper
ation of railroads. The operation feature is some
times modified, as it was in this State by Judge Ma
guire, in the proposition that the Government shall
own the roads but permit their use on the livery
stable plan, by letting any one use them who has or
hires a locomotive and some cars. But this is so ob
viously impractical that the concrete proposition of
public ownership and operation stands as representa
tive of the scheme of the state communists.
They advocate this because in other countries it is
in operation. The nation that has gone farthest on
this line of state railways is Germany. There they
are owned and operated by the Government. Germany
is the best bureaucratic government in existence. Its
organization is the most intensified, and its directing
hand is felt in more ways in the life of the people
thin has ever been known before.
Recently the managing director of the leading Ger
man steel plant made a tour of observation in the
United States to study our capacities in his line of
business. He publishes the results in a Berlin paper.
In the metal trades he finds our conspicuous advan
tage to be in the use of machinery. "In America," he
"we find what seems to us an astonishing sub
stitution of machinery for manual labor. Only in the
n) ost details is hand labor employed. Sin h
t and skillful application of machinery offers es
pecial advantages in a time like this, when manual
labor is costly and difficult to obtain." An equal ele
ment in cheap production here he finds in the sur
prisingly low railway rates. He says: "The American
railway system far surpasses in cheapness and effi
ciency of service anything known in Europe. Freight
cars of all classes far surpass in size and carrying
capacity those of the German railways, and the cost
ol frciqht per ton per mile in the United States is
only 27 per cent of what it is in Germany."
Putting these two elements of cost in production
together, he concludes that when the demand for iron
and steel in the United States slackens there will be
a surplus for export to Germany at prices which Ger
man manufacturers will be unable to meet, especially
in heavy plates, structural metal and rails.
We do not suppose that any observations and con
clusions, or facts themselves, will make any difference
with the political fanatics who hope to win by an
tagonizing everything that is. But these reports of
foreign observers who visit us to study the conditions
of our production and distribution will not be with
out influence upon the men who choose to think.
With distribution by rail 73 per cent cheaper on
American roads than on the state roads of Germany
the productive power of this country has such an ad
vantage as to obsolete all arguments for state owner
ship here, based on comparative rates of transporta
tion. Therefore the plan for Government ownership
in this country will end, if adopted, in magnifying the
real evil of political interference without any economic
benefit to offset it.
Under our system, by a seeming necessity, every
business operation of the Government becomes a
factor in party politics. In war and peace, wher
ever the Government appears as a producer, a car
rier, an operator in any form of business, the party
that happens to be in power stands as a partisan
beneficiary. Give into the hands of the Government
the ownership and operation of our stupendous rail
way system, and very soon, instead of the people
owning the Government, the Government will own
the people, and the political evils now laid at the
doors of railway management will appear as trifles
compared to those which would follow.
The path of progress for this city lies along the
proposed panhandle extension, and if that be not pro
vided progress will be balked.
OF all the election contests that have arisen in
this country to perplex judges the oddest is
one which now frets legal brains or lack of
brains in Maryland. The decision of the case involves
a determination of the exact point in the complex
proceedings of the Australian ballot system at which
the voter can be said to have voted.
The issue arose in this way: J. B. Burnett of Tal
bot County went into a booth on election day and
prepared his ballot. Just after he had marked it and
had it ready to deport he dropped dead The ballot
that he had prepared was afterward carried to the box
and put in, though it was protested at the time by the
Republican election officials. Mr. Carrington. the
Democratic candidate for State's Attorney, has an
official majority of one over Mr. Mulliken.the Repub
lican candidate, and it is claimed that this one is the
ballot cast for Burnett by the election officer.
It is maintained by one side that a man has not
voted until his ballet has boon deposited in the ballot
box. It is claimed by the other that a man votes
when he makes out his ticket, and that having con
formed to the law in making it out it then becomes
the duty of the election officials to put it in the box.
It is further argued that the election officers have no
right to refuse to place the ballot of a properly ac
credited voter into the box after it has been made out,
so long as it is in legal form.
It is â  pretty question, and. whi'e a similar ca-=e j s
n<.t likely to occur, other ca?r* may arise the deter
mination of which will depend upon the decision a*
to the point at which the act of voting is com;.
and for that reason the decision of the Maryland case
.will be noted with interest

FIRST PHOTOGRAPH EVER TAKEN.
The first photographic portrait from life ever made was of Mrs. Dorothy C.
Draper of Hastings, N. V.. who posed for the picture In 1539. Her brother. Dr.
John W. Draper, who had been greaOy interested in the experiments Of Daguerre
and Nlepee. took the likeness, which has since become famous. It Is now In me
collection of Sir John Herschel. It is a long timeâ half a century nowâ since Map
Draper, in the quaint bonnet and gown of the period, sat for her picture, which
is still In an admirable state of preservation. As i faithful and beautiful likeness
It has never been surpassed by modern photography. As a curiosity It is one of
Sir John Herschel's dearest treasures.
It is a long step from the daguerreotype of fifty years ago to the wondeiful
photographs of 1899. Prom the tlrr.o of the discoveries of Wedgewood
in ISO 2to the successful completion of the daguerreotype process by Daguerre in
1533 the only pictures taken were or still life. Evna when the daguerreotype was
in its perfection long exposures were required, varying from three to thirty min
utes. V.'ith a strong sunlight five minutes was considered by many photogra
phers the requisite length of time to take a portrait. " '
The method of obtaining daguerreotypes was complicated. First, a brightly
polished rliver plate was cleaned with pumice, olive oil and nitric acid and aft
erward brilliantly polished with a sort buff. The plate was then placed, face
downward, resting on supports, over a saucer on which had been scattered frag
ments of lodine, covered with gauze. The vapor from the lodine formed upon
the plain a surface of silver lodide, which Is the sensitive compound. The stago
of maximum sensitiveness was reached when it -*-aa of a golden orange color. In
this state the plate was Inserted In the dark slide of the camera, ready for expos
ure. The pictures were beautiful, bu copies could not be made. Not until Dr.
Draper's successful venture was the idea of using the daguerreotype as the
means of perpetuating the likeness of individuals considered feasible. He opened
a new and fascinating realm to the photographer.â York World.

MANUFACTURE OF PINSâ T. K. U..
La Mirada, Cal. Under the old system
of making pins It required fourteen pro
cesses to make one. The head was put
on separately. Now. by the use of ma
chines. 200 pins are turned out a minute,
ready to be tinned and put on paper. The
pins are put on by machinery. The ma
chine crimps the paper and holds it. while
the pins are brought up in long row*, a
whole row being stuck on by one push of
a lever. In the United States pins are all
made by the new process. In a few places
in Europe the old plan Is still followed.

MORGANATIC MARRIAGES-J. I,

rights In the Inheritance of the hu'bnml

completely binding, but fall* to confÂ«r on
th.- wife the title or estate of the hu*bnnd
And on the children thÂ»Â» full Rtatna of le
gitimacy or right of Buccr^lon. T.'io
members of tr.' German princely hous/s*
have for centuries been In the practice r.f
entering Into marriages of this kind with
their Inferiors In rank. Out of this OMtsa
has gradually sprung a code of mntri
nionial law by which the union of prlncn
with person* of lower rank In other thnn
morganatic form Involves st-rlous conso
quence3, especially to the lady. Mcr
ganatlc marriages are recognized not
only among the princely families but
among the higher aristocracy of the â¢â m
plre. and In Prussia even the * f NI* > tJÂ»-r
Adel" may contract unions of this kind.
The royal marriage act 12. George 111.
chapter 2, reduces to a position somewhat
like that of morganatic marriage cvtrv
union In the royal family of Great Britain
not previously approved by the. sovereign
under the great seal, providing the prtu<Â»
entering Into It la under 25 years of a<B

COMIC OPERA IN

as impressive as "Impresario," w â â ;. t
as certainly reject "Dlo Fledermauj"
were it submitted to htm as the editor of
the Century Magazine would reject "John
Gilpln." This Is not a pro that Strauss'
opera and Cowpcr's poem are without
merit. Each has Its place among tho
lesser classics; but neither fits in with re
cent taste nor can either retrain It* 'cst
popularity. The plot of "Die Fledtr
mam," which is merely the elaboration
of a practical Joke, has In It only that
dubious kind of humor which Is amusing
to its perpetrator and to nobody else. It
may have a certain amount of social
satire th it amuses on its native strafe,
but we who are not of Vienna and not
moved to laughter by it tfnd it on tho
whole rather dull and stupid.
Moreover, comic opera In "pants" Is
a misfit. The triad garments of modern
civilization destroy all our cherished Illu
sions, cultivated by long contemplation
of the pock and buskin.
The Morosco company has excelled here
tofore In light German opera, but "PlÂ»
Fledermaus" requires a most energetic
performance to make it fro. If tho action
Is not swift It drags, and the music v. < â â : ;
dash to make It Interesting A casual
performance Is fatal and it Is a casual
performance that Is being given at the

to sustain the pitch for two consecutive

ar.d led by his creature, the San

Colonel Cures may keep within his dis
position the valuable patronage of that

that body to the charter have been la the

I tlon that three members of the Board of
I Health and Dr. William P. Law Health
Orticer. and also Mr. Burns' agent on the
board, will contest the appointment by
Mayor Phelan of their successors under
the provisions of the charter.
Those of the board who have agreed to
take Burns" bidding In the matter are.
Dr. William B. F. Ba.rbc.l, Dr. Redmond
W. Payne and Dr. J. W. Kteney. They
nave not only taken Mr. Burns' orders, but
; have entered with enthusiasm upon their
enterprise, and are so conrident of success
that they have boasted to the extent that
I the friends of the charter are Informed of
every point they will be called upon to
The Burns clique will rely solely upon
the constitution of the State In their tight
to hold oSlce. Section SM of article 11 of
that document gives to municipalities
power to create and jurlsd'.cton over
Beards of Election. Fire Commissioners.
Police Commissioners and other bodies
necessary to a city's economy, but It does
not confer the power to create a Board
of Health. It gives that authority solely
to the State Legislature, and the lawyers
I who have been consulted by Mr. Burns
hold that the Legislature cannot delegate
the fame authority to a municipality In
the face of the express provisions of the
t^iÂ«titutlon. The Burns people further
c;jJm that when the San Francisco Board
: of Health waa created It was not Intended
to be purely a local Institution, but wan
riven Jurisdiction over the health condt
| lions and affairs of Sausallto and other
suburban territory beyond the limits of
the city and county. That it Is now noth
ing more than a local body exercising au
thority over none but local affairs, they
claim, is due solely to the past manage
] nur.t of the office and not to the provi
sions of the law which created It.
All of these facts or fictions are of Mr.
Bums* discovery- His attorneys, and not
thr>^o cf the Board of Health, were set to
work finding flaws In the charter. Burns
communicated them to the board through
Health Officer William Lawlor. when he
made known, by the same agent, his de
sire that the charter be contested In every
c!au*e which had reference to the Board
of Health. Mr. Burns did not call the
members of the board In for a general
conference; he does not do his work that
way. as wa? amply demonstrated during
the recent session of the Legislature. In
stead he Intrusted the whole matter to Dr.
Lawlor. and since early In November that
official has beer. working up the plan with
the members of the board. Dr. Barbat
favored the scheme from the start. As
Burns' private physician and political con
fidant he was ready for any order that
might come down to him fmra his chief,
so long as It should not Jeopardize his pro
fessional standing r.or hi* reputation for
honesty and Integrity.
Dr. Barbat does not consider that an at
tack upon the charter damages either.
Dr. K*er>ey came next, and then Dr. Law
lor began wooing the Immaculate Dr.
Payne Payne was Just a bit coy for a
time, but the plausible Lawlor arguments.
In which good citizenship and Its rewards
were set forth from an essential Burns
standpoint, finally prevailed, and at a lit
tle heart-to-heart talk ween the three
and Dr. Lawlor at the Zlnkand. on
Wednesday night, the whole thing was
settled, and Colonel Burns has been duly
Informed of Lawlor's glittering success.
Dr. Coffey was approached on the
scheme. It Is sail, but positively refused
to have any connÂ»*ctlon with It. When
seen last night he said that he had heard
M th*> plan, but that it had not been dis
cussed with him.
"I would not go in on It If I were askel."
Fald he. "My private practice and my
position with the railroad company re
quire all of tny time and I am better out
of politics than In It. Besides I think the
charter expresses the will of the people of
this city. It certainly expresses mine;
and I have no desire to feat any of the
reforms or changes It Is Intended - ac
complish."

out 10 make room for a newcomer. Scma
of the speakers drew attention to the fact
that the Sausalito passengers would faavo
to land In the rain and mud. while the
other people would enter the Ccrry depot
dryshod.
At considerable length the Commission
ers exr>lAi nert what was proposed to be
done. The SauMlito and Tlburon wait

just the same as at present, only In a
different location. The pascenKers will
have a few more feet to walk, but It will
be under a covered way and mere will
Ibe no puch thins as rain or mud. The
members of the board then took the m

was proposed to do. The Marln people

LAWYERS FIND
WEAK PLACES
IN THE CHARTER
Faults Must Be En

TIME LIMIT OF AMENDMENT
Method of Levying Assessment on
Private Property Contrary to the
Provisions of the Federal
Constitution.
The r<Â»w charter will go Into effect on
January S. two weeks from â¢:â¢ xt Monlay.
Several lawyers of ability assert that It
will on that day place an embargo on
â treet and sewer Improvements at the ex
pense of private property such as has
rot been seen la this city since the con
stitution of 1573 demanded that street as
sessments should be levied in advance
cf the award of contractâ a provision thai
had to be repealed almost Immediately
after Its adoption
Doubtless this news will spread Jubila
tion among the Silurians and make glad
the hearts nf the curmudgeons: but what
of the anticipated era of "progress" which
was to appear on Christmas. 1599. as a
sort of fin de selcle present to the people
of San Francisco? Instead of progress be
ing ushered In by the new charter three
years of 3tangnatlon In street and sewer
Improvements may result. Following Is
the text of the argument advanced by
lawyers *:. predict a period of stagna

Works to recommend, and the Supervisors

at the exr*r.sÂ« of adjacent property. But
the method provided for levying assess
ments and creating Hens upon tha lots thus
benefited is unconstitutional and void.
la the case of Norwood vi. Baker (ITI U.

Courtâ of whose reasoning all the subordi
nate tribunals of the country stand la ivÂ«
ar.d tremblingâ that any method of
levying assessments for public Improvements
a*, private espena* which does rut establish
as equitable apportionment of cost according
to benefit Is In conflict with that clause of
the Federal constitution which forbids a
State to deprive a person of his property
without due process of law. The new char
ter provides that assessments for street and
sewer work shall be levied by the Trent foot
and district methois without reference to
the benefits conferred on the property owners

Judge Burnett cf the Fupertcr Court of So

Hetaiuma Pavln* Company, en May 14 last.
applied the doctrine of Norwood vs. Baker to
California, declaring the assessment system
of the Vrooman act. which Is subetantlally
reproduced in the new charter, unconstitu
tional. This rase has been appealed and
will be decided by the l^cal Supreme Court
In a fÂ»w months, or perhapi weeks. There
Is not the 'lightest doubt that the ruling of
the Federal tribunal will be followed, not-

becaa*e property owner* will not pay unless
th* llÂ«n for work performed can bÂ« enforeM.
But how shail chapter J if article VI of the

GITN PLANT FOR BENICIA.
The possibilities of the establishment of
a cun-assembllng plant at Benicia appear
brighter now than for a long time pas-t.
Shortly before the breaking out of the
war with Spain the officers of the Manu
facturers' and Producers* Association un
dertook to create an Interest la the pro
ject, and without any trouble obtained the
co-operation of alt of the commercial bod
ies In promoting the scheme at Washing
ton. The opening of hostilities put a stop
to further efforts, and the matter was
allowed to lie quietly until recently, when
the manufacturers again took It up. Let
ters were sent to all of thÂ» Congressmen
and Senators calling attention to the pros
pective benefit, not only to the West, but
to the nation. In having a plant here
where the different parts of guns for the
army and navy could be put together and
moved to any desired point. In fact, the
largest of our warships could be ntted
cut while lying at the wharf of the Pa
cific's Inland sea.
This advantage was called to the atten
tion of the Secretary of War. who sraa
advised to peruse a favorable report made
long ago by a Congressional commission
appointed to look into the project. Yes
terday the Manufacturers' and Producers"
Association received a letter from Secre
tary Hoot, In which he sayÂ« that he ha 4
presented the matter to the Committee on
Military Affairs of thÂ» House, which
means that he has approved of the pro
posed plant. Senator Perkins has also
written that he is working on the matter,
with every hope of success.

No Fear When Death Draws Nigh.
"I have seen thousands of persons die
under all sorts of circumstances and never
yet have 1 seen one display the slightest
rear of death." TVs remarkable state
ment was made the other day by a phy
sician who has practiced many years in
Philadelphia and who has seen a great
deal of hospital service.
"It is a popular fallacy." he Trent on,
"to imagine that a deathbed scene is ever
terrible, other than as a parting between
loved ones. The fear of the unknown is
never present at the last. Even amid ig
norance end vice I have never experienced
such scenes as a novelist, who strives
after realism, will sometimes picture.
"When a patient is told that he cannot
recover and the end Is near he Invariably
seems resigned to his fate, and his only
thought seems to be of those who are to
be left behind. This is true alike of men
and women.
"Those who become hysterical and de
clare they are not fit to die are the ones
who are not asÂ» ill as they think they are
They always get well.

ATTEMPT FAILS TO SUCCEED
An effort was made by Director Stow at
the special meeting of the. Board of Edu
cation yesterday afternoon to frustrate
any possible attempt by Director Kemp
to elect a batch of new teachers. Stow
moved that the rules be suspended and
that the board adjourn to meet only
at the call of the chair. In speaking to
his motion, which would do away with
the regular meeting next Wednesday,
Mr. Stow said:
"I believe that this board can transact
all the necessary business at a special
meeting called by the chair. I desire to
avoid any unpleasant scenes such as this
board has experienced at Its last two reg
ular meetings."
President Bergerot stated that there
would be no quorum at the next meeting
as several of the directors would be in at
tendance at the Teachers' Convention In
Sacramento. Director Heed said that he
was opposed to any such special meeting,
as only the named business In the call
could be transacted. The motion to sus
pend the rules was then put and lost.

of the elections nc-xt week. The Mayor
continued his speech ana congratulated
the poople of North Beach on the Interest
they are showing In measures from which
tbmy will certainly derive a great benefit.
A. Sbarboro said:
"I conscientiously believe that the is
suance of bonds will enhance the value of
property from North Reach to the county
line and from the ocean to the bay.
"The people who wt lk. receive the money
for their property on the panhandle will
purchase land In all parts of the city. The
laborers, mechanics and artisans who
work at the extension of the park and to
build new houses wilt come from all parts
of the city, and consequently the shop
keepers an<l merchants generally will de
rive their benefits in all parts of the city.
"North Beach will be materially bene
fited by the improvements, as you will
have the following schools: Lafayette
Primary, corner of Kearny and Filbert
streets, an eight-class room new building
of stone and brick to cost J30.0P0; Broad
way Grammar, Broadway, between Pow
ell and Mason streets, four additional
rooms, to cost WO.000; Garfield Primary
School, Union street, between Kearny and
Montgomery, a new elghteen-class room
building of stone and brick of modern
architecture, to cost HO â â¢â¢ Washington
Grammar School, corner of Washington
and Mason streets, an entirely new eight
een-class room modern brick and stone
building, to cost $150 .000â thus making a
total of SSIO.OCO. which will be spent right
here in North Beach for the benefit of
your children of the present and those of
future generations.
"I also believe that In the near future
we will have a boulevard from the foot
of Market street to Powell, to Van NesÂ»
and along the water front to the Cliff
House, connecting with the beautiful
drive along the beach to Lake Merced and
thence into Ben If al County .which will
make one of the most beautiful scenic
and Interesting drives on the face of thÂ»

city to build the panhandle." said the
Mayor, "and every resident will be Ml

him an opportunity to enjoy rest, recre

tion to the subject of the park extension.
The lonr'st speech of the evening was
made by Mr Sweitcert. He said that all
the great cities ot Europe and of the
United States had spent largÂ«Â« sums of
money in Improvements for the purpose
of beautlflcatton and health, and tho In
vestment had been profitable to them.
San Francisco had stood still and had
been afraid to Issue bonds to do thÂ«Â»
work that needed to be done. If It was
said that the park panhandle extension
was a luxury, then it must also be said
that Golden Gate Park was a luxury on a
larger scale. But r.-a5 there too much of
the park" Would any on* In San Fran
cisco consent to the cuttlnc up of the
park? The panhandle extension would be
the means of putting millions of ,I., liars
Into the pockets of labor, and It would In
crease the realty values 1 In all parts of the
city.
Mr. Troy furnished a dozen excellent
reasons for the panhandle. A new point
that he made was that It would constitute
ft valuable firebreak In case a great con
flagration should ever originate In the
WfÂ«tfrn section of the city.
Silas A. White said he had been made
a convert to the panhandle during
the day. and had rrached the conclusion
that the panhandle was necessary by
traveling all over the line of the proposed
extension on foot.

NO RECOMPENSE
FOR SACRIFICE
TO PATRIOTISM
Government Roasted
by General McCook.
Staying at the Palace Hotel, where be
arrived last evening from Colorado, js a
gentleman who haÂ» done moro than a
little In making American history. ilia
name la Oeneral K. M. McCook. and his
present visit to this city, bo he pays. Is
taken with the Intention of finding out If
his rheumatism, from which disease he Is
r constant sufferer, will to benefited by
the climate of the coast.
General McOook Is now a very old man.
He himself gives his age us SC. and dur
ing a life that has been full of participa
tion In great events he has witnessed
many thrilling occurrence* that make
him, when he Is in the vein, a raconteur
well worth listening to.
l>orn on a frontier farm In Indiana, he
received his first education in a little 1"C
FChoolhouso. attending its sessions off and
en as his duties on the farm would per
mit. Aft soon as he bad acquired a fair
knowledge of the rule of three he left the
ptretttal roof and started out to make his
<>Â«n way in thw world and to pick up the
balance cf his knowledge as he wont
ulocg.
Since then he has been soldier, stateÂ«
mnn. diplomat. nn<! business magnate, and
fen* even addi'd Journalism to his many
other calling?. Now. in his old age, he
rest* content with the simple title of mil
llonnlre, traveling from place to place, an
his fancy <!lct:itÂ«-s and enjoying the so
ciety of his friend*, among whom ate
numbered every distinguished living man
cf thin country and Europe.
He hns b*>en the Intimate of such men
ns Grant, Lincoln. Seward. Cutter. Fre
mont and the elder Vanderbllt. and his
reminiscences of these '.-. â â  is persons are
replete with humor and Interest.
erlr.it the civil war as a KUbordlnato
oflictT In an Indiana regiment, he camu
out of the struggle with Utn rank of a
brigadier general of volunteers, and was
npjKilnted to a communion In the regular
army. He resigned almost mmedlataly
to undertake a mission from President
Johnron to the Hawaiian Islands that had
for its object the purchase of the terri
tory that has lately become ours by an
nexation. His mission was not accom
plished owing to the opposition it encoun
tered both from our own Senate and the
Islanders, but it resulted In the famous
trf-ity of reciprocity, from which this
country reaped so much ad vantage. After
that he was twice Governor of the Terri- ,
tory of Colorado and wa* twice offered
Cabinet positions under different adminis- i
trations, which he refused.
<rÂ»ncral McCook was a warm personal
friend and strong admirer of the Jate
General Lawton. who had served under
him In the Civil War. He speaks In the
highest terms of the bravery and per
sonal qualities of the dead leader, and Is
very outer on the attitude that the
I.'nlted State* maintains toward the fnml
ll*s of those of hÂ«r soldiers and sailors
who are slain in battle.
"It Is on outrage." said General Mr-
Cook last evening, "that the widows and
orphan* of the men who Five up their
lives for their country should be placed
Jn the position of mendicants, dependent
on private charity for the means to live.
No man in cither the army or navy can
araaw oven a subsistence to leave his
family unless hf Is a rascal or It comes
t" him by Inheritance. Dewey comes
home and Is made thÂ« object of public
bounty, and when he uses the roods given
him as ho Â«*Â« fit he In vilified by the
Â«ntlro country. General Lawton. than
vhom no finer soldier ever lived, dies
In discharge of his duty and his family
have to be taken rare of by private sub
*crlptlon. No other country on earth
treats the families of Its herora â¢. this
manner, and it Is & shame and an out
racÂ«? that a government as powerful and
w< althy as this one cannot make some
decent provision for the men who die to
maintain it."

YELLOW TAIL
RAN LIKE A
WILD HORSE
Covered Six Furlongs in Fast
Time at Oakland â Some
Great Racing.
1..D Father Time
nibbed his eyes In
astonishment at the
electrifying bursts
of speed displayed
by the different
money getters at
Oakland yesterday.
The track was light
ning fast and one or
two records had a
close call. Probably
the most meritorious
X>erformance of the
afternoon was that
of Yellow Tall, the ten thousand dollar
beauty, in the free handicap for two-year
olds at six furlongs. Foster & Hacketl's
giant colt picked up 120 pounds and step
ping off the first half in :4?Va came home
as he pleased in 1:12 flat. He was ridden
by Eddie Jones and ruled a strong favor
ite in the ring. Southern i Girl made a
game but Ineffectual effort to catch him.
Erwin, a M to 1 shot, finished well the last
furlong, nosing out Flamora for the place.
Tappan. from the stable of Frank Doss,
was the only other winning favorite. The
disappointments were Fine Shot, Frank
Bell, Rosormonde and Sloe rite;.
In the last dash on the card Afamada
' defeated a half dozen of fast ones, at the
earns time equaling the California record
, for six furlongs of 1:12*3. The brown mare
hud' Jenkins on her back and was quoted
| asjrood as 6to 1. Leading from the Jump.
sHe galloped In two lengths ahead of Mo
corlto, the favorite, Sly was third, less
than a length farther away.
Barney Schrelber furnished the first fa
vortte in Fine Shot. The colt showed
speed but backed up, running unplaced.
May Gertrude, the well backed second
choice, won cleverly from The Echo.
The much-talked-about Frank Bell
started In the second event at five and a
half furlongs, with Eddie Jones up. The
Easterner ruled a stanch favorite until
tho coin went In on Midlove, when it m
hto 5 and take your pick. The pair named
fought it out from the start, tiring badly
as tho wire was r.eared. Searing this
stage Vittltoe brought the 15 to 1 shot.
; Sister Alice, up with a rush, winning by
half a length. Bell got the place by a
I head.
A stirring finish marked the close of the
mile and a sixteenth Felling run. Tappan,
the favorite, with Thorpe In the saddle,
getting the decision from Wyoming by a
nose. Spencer rode the last named horse
and made ail the running. Meadowthorpe
ran a fair third. The time. 1:4*4, marked
a fast run race, the mile being reeled off
In l:40&
To the weak ride of Jenkins rather than
the lack of speed shown by Hosormonde
could be attributed the victory of Ventoro
in the mile handicap. The Ormonde mare
had first call in the betting, carrying top
weight, 110 pounds. Jenkins allowed
Walsh, on the lightweight, to steal away
In tho lead, getting in in time to lose by
half a length In l:3iÂ»\. Sybaris ran into
the enow.
Track Notes.
The Baldwin stable and Jockey Eddie
Ross have been exonerated from blame
for the poor showing made by El Es;ro
In a race OB Tuesday. It developed that
the mare struck herself during the prog
ress of the race, which accounted for her
stopping ;-o badly.
Owner "Bill" Murray is still Fore over
the loss of Tar Hill, claimed out of a sell
ing race at Tnnforan by Frank Doss. Al
ter Tappan had won Murray bid the
brown gelding up J.VW over ncr entered
selling price. Trainer Doss bid the u>uui
(5.
After the last event Spencer, who rode
Mocorito, was cautioned by the Judges
and told to try and Infuse more life and
vigor Into his riding.

his men on the Jump whenever an oppor

miles of atmosphere in this work.
The trip was a mere diversion to the
red men. From Benicla to Oakland they
were up to all sorts of tricks and pranks.
Clog dances, sentimental and religious
songs in the same breath and particularly
the coon variety made the Indian special
an Impromptu vaudeville stage. They
have songs of their own. with which they
expect to terrify the Californlans. One
sung to the refrain of a "Hot Old Time"
ends: "When we hit their line, there'll
be no line at all, but there'll be a hot
time in our town to-night."
When the Palace was reached the red-
Bhirted footballers trudped in with dress

Odors of Various Herbs Found to De-

Intere<?tlnp experiments with the odors

COCHRAN
INJURED IN
PRACTICE
California's Coach Had Two
Ribs Fractured in a
Scrimmage.
Larry Cochran. the famous coach of
California's victorious football team for
two years, veteran of four trying sea
sons of gridiron war. Is among the foot
ball Injured of '99. In the practice of yes
terday afternon preparatory to meeting
tho Carlisle Indians the master of p<K
skln science, while playing on the scrub
team against the Berkeley 'varsity, was
jambed to the ground under heavy Inter
ference, that caused the breaking of two
ribs. The injury is a severe one and has
confined him to his bed. He will not be
i able to further coach the Berkeley eleven.
! and it is doubtful if he will be permitted
to attend the Carlisle-California game.
The injury was the result of over-en
thusiasm on the part of the coach. East
ern coaches on Western gridirons have
seldom donned their football togs in
t< a- hing the men the fine points of play,
lerliaps the snappy December weather
s {Â»rred the blood of Cochran to attempt
old-time deeds and to demonstrate that he
could put into practice that which for two
; years he has preached with such good
1 effect. At any rate on Monday afternoon
l- or . t P. e , tlrst tilne since tne memorable
l ale-Princeton game of '97, when Old Nas
nau s Bplendld but crippled team, which
cochran captained, was beaten by a 6-0
I Bc Â°re. he Jumped into actual play and
i tackled and ran down on punts as In
i other years. Four days of solid work has
oiled the Berkeley 'varsity machinery, and
yesterday the action was like that of
rnanksgivlng day. It was smash and
bang HKainst the second eleven, with
Hall, Smith and Ka.irsberg under way
like pistol shuts. Cochran was out at end
on the scrub, and on tlrst eleven's st>le
Of attack wasn't getting enough work to
even remind him of the old Princeton
days, when Yale backs "failed to gain a
yard around him." Perhaps the fact that
It was Cochran out there caused the
quarter to form the play on other points.
At any rate the mighty end chafed unu>r
Inaction and dared the backs to send the
play his way.
"Give me something to do out here." he
shouted. "Take a chance at an old 'h;<s
bÂ«en' and Bee how it feels." There was
a quick signal, three lightning bucks at
the pride of Princeton ana Berkeley.
Smith, with the ball, made his distance,
while Cochran went out of the play. Percy
Hall's muscular effort, with 1&5 pounds
back of It, had placed th.> great coach
hors de combat at the bottom of a pile,
and Incidentally smashed two ribsâper
haps, if fate would have it. the similar
pair to those of Captain Chet Murphy,
that suffered the 6ame injury before
Thanksgiving day. Cochran was imme
diately observed to be In a bad plight and
Wai taken from the field.
The Injury, at any event. Is particularly
nard luck for Cochran personally, com
ing as it does long after his active grid-
Iron days are passed, and to the Berk-l-y
team is equally unfortunate, as the su
perb pklll and coaching spirit of ihe
Princeton man was counted upon ns a big
element In the. wÂ»rk of preparing the first
California eleven to meet a team typi< .il
ly Eastern ami up-to-date in Its strengtn

HOTEL MAN HOVERING
NEAR DEATH'S DOOR
M. M. HARTMAN IS A VICTIM OF
OPIUM POISONING.
Believed to Have Attempted to End
His Life Because of Recent
Financial Trouble.
OAKLAND. Dec. 21.-M. M. Hartman.
proprietor of the Crellln Hotel, died to
night, presumably from opium poisoning,
and It is rumored that ho committed sui
cide.
Hartman was found thin afternoon Buf
fering from morphine or laudanum pois
oning In his room in the hotel. Dr. Frank
L. Adams and Dr. Todd wore called and
worked over him until midnight, when he
died. Members of the family declare his
death was due to accidentally taking an
over-dose of medicine.
Hartman's affairs have become en
tangled In the last few months. He Is
said to have been playing the races, but
It Is certain that he has been borrowing
money wherever he could and his hotel
lease finally became involved. He secured
a considerable amount of money from J.
It. Watson, a mining man. and about four
woeks ago Hartman incorporated his In
terest in the Crellin Hotel In a company
and practically resigned its management.
J. It. Watson took a lot of stock In the
company for the money loaned Hartman,
and Hartman turned the rest of his stock
.over to his two daughters, and these
daughters assumed the active manage
ment of the hotel. Watson and his daugh
ters were in harmony as to the manage
ment of the hotel, but Hartman. who was
over 60 years of age, seemed to feel his
reverses very keenly. There was not the
slightest effort upon the part of either the
daughters or "Watson to do otherwise than
help save what was left of the old man's
fortune. He remained in the hotel and
even nominally retained the title of man
ager.
There was some difficulty between the
new management and Mrs. Archer, a
woman who owns Don Gara and several
other horses. They demanded that Mrs
Archer rhould pay her board or leave the
house. She produced a receipt for three
months' rent in advance from Hartman
but the new hotel management declared
that there was something irregular about
it. Mrs. Archer employed ex-Judge A L
Frick to protect her Interests, and much
trouble ensued. It is said that these
troubles, together with his financial re
verses, prey-ed upon the old man's mind
until he determined to end his life.

Ingleside Club Vote Against

Week's Stake.
At a special meeting of Ingleslde Cours

night a series of resolutions were pre
sented which, if adopted, would have
tended to upset the amicable relations ex
isting between the associations promoting
the sport in and about, this city. Accord

made of the adherents of one park out

Do People Live on Mars?
Some new light Is now thrown on the
planet Mars by Profersor Ernst F?a- <kcl
a genuine philosopher. In the new book'
"World Problems." He says: '
"If we assume that Mars i.Â« inhabited
we must assume that the men and women
whose borne is on the planet are not ouch
as we. but of a far higher type. They
may resemble us exteriorly, but they are
free from our physical defects and excel
us In strength and gracefulness. It is -,n
the Intellectual sphere, however, that tt<clr
superiority Is most cleary shown" If
there- are human beings on this planet it
Is extremely probable that they far cur
pass ordinary men and women in Intel
ligence."
Another question often asked Is: "Will
we ever be able to communicate with the
inhabitants of distant planets?" Professor
Haeckel's reply Is that there Is very lÂ«t
tle probability of any direct commun'ea
tlon ever being established. His reasons
because the earth Is such a great dis
tance from Mars and other planets and
because, the condition of the. air between
the earth and these planets is such as to
render direct communication by any oos
means at present known to us impossible.

BACTERIA
Communicated by Kissing May
Cause Teeth to Decay.
Physicians started an antl-klsslni? cru
sade several years apo. telling fearsoma
stories of the transfer of bacteria from up
to lip, but whatever of truth and of dan
ger there was in the warnings of the med
ical men was overwhelmed by the deluga
of fun poured out all over the country by
the men who make their living by wntlntc
funny things. In the meantime kissing
lost none of Its fascination, and every
body, including the bacteria, continued to
be nappy.
Now comes In the dentist with moro
fearsome tales, and It seems only right to
let him have his innings.
"Decay of the teeth, or, as we call It.
caries of the teeth." fays a New York
dentist, "Is due to the presence of bacte
ria. Bacteria can be conveyed from mouth
to mouth by klsslnfr. Therefore, no mat
ter how tine a set of teeth you may have.
if you kiss a person who has decayed
teeth you will soon need my services. A
young woman whom I know, and who by
Inheritance possessed a marvelously per
fect set of teeth, and was robust and of
extremely cleanly habits, used to come to
me and have her teeth cleaned when only
the closest scrutiny could detect the
{â tains which she wished removed. Up to
the age of 19 she never needed a fllllnir.
About that time she brought to my offlco
a young man whom she introduced as her
fiance. He wished ray professional serv
ices, and I gave him an appointment. An
examination disclosed a nlthy mouth. It
was necessary to use corrective agents
before I could tolerate him.
"Had It not been that he was engaged
to marry a girl whom I knew to be
ideally hygienic. I should not have given
to the cleansing of his teeth the amount
of attention which I did, because I recog
nized in him a man careless of his teeth
and breath, who would be un.ippreclatlv*
of my efforts. It required thr.Â« sittings
to get his teeth Into a semblance of clean
liness, and then he refused to have th*
gaping carious caverns filled. I remon
strated. I Â»poke of the perfect teeth of
his Intended. He laughed carelessely and
asked what difference it made to her. I
explained. I could do no mor>. They
were married, and before a year elapsed
I was obliged to insert seven or eight fill
ings in her teeth. She now has a full set
of artificial teeth.
"I knew a young man who had his teeth
ruined by keeping company with a girl
who had unclean teeth. She was good
looking, but he did not marry herâsome
thing prevented. Ills teeth have not de
cayed since."

with It at ore time, and when I set out
to visit my old home in Michigan I bought
a dozen bells to take along. Nobody In
the town had heard of them, but I hadn't
worn one over a day when the people
caught on and I was fairly besieged.
When Sunday came 1 prepared to attend
church like, a dutiful son and at th*
proper time mother and I -vere seated in
her pew. Just what ihe text was I can't
remember, but the minister had scarct-ly
announced It when six of my chestnut
bells sounded among the congregation.
"The good man didn't mind them In ths
least, but went ahead with his work. He.
was rung up on his hymn, and he was
rung up every minute or two on his ser
mon; and though there was something
amusing about it I was also half-scared
out of my boots. As I had brought the
bells to town I didn't knew but what he'd
hold me responsible and open out on me.
About the middle of his sermon he said
something about Jonah, and eleven of
those bells went 't-l-n-g" on him In suc
cession. He stopped and looked around
and then calmly said:
" 'Will those people who are Ilnglln*
keys kindly Jingle a little softer?''
"I was thankful to get out of that
church without a calamity. continued thÂ»
bell man. "and I didn't do any laughing
till the next day. Then It was because I
learned that every blessed man who had
rang up the minister was seriously in
earnest about It and felt It a sort of duty
and because that minister himself called*
at the house and accepted my own bell
and rung It up on mother within five, ml n
utes!"

ThÂ«re is every probability that in the
vory near future this coast will have a re
llef lightship. The need of such a vessel
was made apparent a few months ago.
wh*Â»n It became necessary to take the one
now off the bar In for an overhauling.
The repairs took over a month, and dur
ing that time the lighthouse tender Ma
drone was put on the bar. but not being
f-qulpped for.?uch service it was but little
Letter than no ship at all. A short time
ajro the lightship anchored oft the Co
lumbia River bur got adrift In a storm
and went ashore, leaving that dangerous
point without anything to warn marineis.
The local chamber of Commerce sent to
the Pacific Coast delegation asking that
n relief rhlp be sen: to this coast, and
recent letters from Senator Perkins and
others lea<!s to the belief that the desired
vessel will be provided before long. In

rotary of either university by
â¢
In submitting the subject for discus
sion Dr. Stallard makes the following in
troductory remarks: "As many writers on
matters of FtÂ»ei<-ty and politics, both in
Europe and America, are at the present
time inclined to discredit certain propo
sitions stated In the Declaration of Inde
pendence, and to regard them as the mere
dreams of French philosophers, beyond
the scope of practical politics. It seems
to be a fitting moment to invite a re
examination of the question whether or
not these propositions are correct and
presently attainable and practicable, and
If so. toy what means they are to be at
tained."
Dr. Stallard then quotes the celebrated
"equal rights" clause from the Declara
tion of Independence and lays down the
following points for discussion:
"Firstâ what meaning should be attach
ed to the term "right of man?' If this
phrase Is metaphorical, what should be
Its literal statement?
"Secondâ Are all men created equal with
respect to the rights therein declared to
be inalienable?
"Thirdâ What are the economic condi
tions upon which the enioyment of these
inalienable rights depends?
"Fourthâ ls it the function of govern
ments to securo these economic conditions
equally for all men?
"Fifthâ What legislation is required to
attain these ends?"
The best two prizes will respectively

NARROW ESCAPE OF
BRAKEMAN THOMAS GREEN
During a Wreck a Piece of Flying
Cordwood Pnss?d Dangerously
Nenr His Head.
SAN RAFAEL. Dec. 21.â Thomas Green,
a brakemnn in the employ of the Califor
nia Northwestern Railway Company, had
one of the narrowest escapes from death
ever recorded to-night in a collision be
tween freight cars at the depot east of
town. Several drawheads were smashed,
air x>ipes torn asunder, a steam pipe In
the engine broken and one car thrown on
top of another as the result of the
smash-up.
The owl freight left Petaluma to-night
at 6 o'clock, with Conductor Michael
Clancy in charge and Engineer James
Donahue at the throttle. Before coming
over the hill north of town the train of
thirty cars was divided into two sections.
As the first section came down the hill a
link connecting a rta'car. loaded with
cordwood. to a boxcar, .filled with chick
ens, broke. The cars stayed together un
til the depot was reached, when they
separated In the dark, unknown to the
trainmen.
Green stood on the flatcar next the
broken link and stepped off to turn the
switch just as the crash came. The box
car wan thrown upon the tiatcar with a
noise that brought a hundred citizens to
the scene in less than five minutes. A sec
ond sooner and Green would have been
crushed to a pulp. As it was a piece of
cordwood hurtled through the air and
came within an ace of knocking his head
off. The freight was two hours late in
reaching Tiburon in consequence of the
collision. A short while ago a number of
cars were derailed In a collision at Igna
cio, and several accidents of a minor na
ture have also occurred.

A GREAT MASTER OF JUDICIAL ANALYSIS.

X.â JOHN MARSHALL.
For thirty-five years John Marshall was
the head of the United States Supreme
Court. He was our greatest Chief Juh- j
tlce and one of the world's greatest m <-- '
ters of Judicial analysis. Indeed, so jnvcit |
was the fame he acquired that he seenrÂ» i
to have been destined by nature .to b>-'j
come a great Jurist. Nor were ht- Judi
cial services the only ones he rendered
his country. Long before he- becamv a
member of the Supreme Court he had
won an enviable fame as soldier, legis
lator and statesman.
Mr. Marshall was a native of Virginia,
find was born In Fauquler County tn 1~5.
He had excellent educational opportuni
ties tn his youth, but was denied the ad
vantages of collegiate training. In place
of college he entered the rough school of
war. Here he studied men Instead of
booksi he strengthened the manliness of
his character and learned to be self-re
liant. He was a soldier for nearly six
JOHN MARSHAtL.
years and fought in the memorable bat
tles of Brandyw!nf. OÂ» rmantown and
Monmouth. WhÂ»n his military s< I
wf re ended he studied law and waÂ« soon
admitted to practice. He served his Slate
for two years in the House of Burgesses
and wa? a member of the State Executive
Council for a like period.
Mr. Marshall was not a member of the (
convention that framed the national con
stitution ; he was. however, a member of !
the Virginia ratifying convention. In this }
body there was a most pronounced orpo- j
ultlon to ratification, led by Patrick Hen- I
ry, George Mason and William Grayaon,
all of whom were able and eloquent men.
The debates took a wide range. But It
was not often that Marshall participated
in them; when he did his speeches were
devoted to only the most Important is
sues, and nearly always were replies to
Patrick Henry. He spoke with great ef- }
fectiveness; his logic was unanswerable, j
and probably to him more than to any
one else Is due the turning of the scale |
In favor of the constitution. When the j
constitution was ratified Marshall deter- j
mined to retire from public life and to I
devote himself to the law. His wish In \
this matter was not to be gratified. There j
was still a large minority hostile to the â 
constitution. Some were willing to go so |
far in s their opposition as to defeat. If
possible, the new Government. Marshall |
believed the new ord<--r should have a fair i
trial and that all the provisions of the
constitution should be enforced, and when
the opposition set out to secure the anti
federnl ascendency In the Legislature he
listened to the earnest appeals ol his
neighbors and accepted an election In that
body. He served two terms and brought
his great powers to the defense of the
federal cause and Washington adminis
tration. He was again in the Legislature
In 1795 and 175<5. At this time the country
was excited over Jay's treaty with Eng
land. In the Virginia Legislature the con
stitutionality of the treaty was assailed
on the ground that It Interfered with ttie
power of Congress to regulate commerce;
bat Marshall demonstrated the fallacy of
this argument so convincingly that the
opposition contented itself with passing a
resolution merely declaring the treaty In
expedient.
In these years Marshall had succeeded
at the law. His rise had been rapid and
he soon rtood at the head of the Virginia
bar with a large and, for that time, lucra
tive practice. He had diligently and pro
foundly studied both international and
public law and so thoroughly had mas
tered them that he had no superior in the ,
entire count! and It is very doubtful
whether he had an equal. His great U-gal
ability and the fact that he had been at
all times a powerful defender of the ad
ministration caused President Washing
ton In 1735 to Invite him to become his
Attorney General. Marshall declined this
appointment and also one the rex- year
to succeed James Monroe to France.
When he declined the latter appointment
President Washington named General
Charles Cotesworth Plnckney In his place;
but the French directory refused to re
ceive Pinckney and ordered him to leave
the country. Then no other appointment
to France was made during this adminis
tration. In June following his Inaugura
tion President Adams, hoping to re-estab
lish diplomatic relations, appointed Plnck
my, Marshall and Elbrldge â¢â â¢ â as Joint
envoys; but the experiment was a failure.' *
The envoys had not been in Paris long
before secret agents of the Minister ap
proached them, demanding money. These
demands were indignantly repelled. Mar
shall drew up an elaborate paper In which,
while expressing an earnest desire for
maintaining friendly relations with
France, be set forth w.th great precision
the requirements of the United Stairs.
This availed nothing and Plnckney and (
Marshall, who were Federalists, and as
such were supposed to sympathize with â 
England and against France, were or
dered to leave French territory: Gerry,
however, who was a republican, was per
mitted to remain In Paris. Marshall Im- ;
mediately returned to the United States
and was everywhere received with demon
strations of approval. Patrick Henry
wrote a friend, saying: "Tell Marshall I
love him because he felt and acted an a
republican, as an American." Almost Im
mediately after Mr. Marshall's return.
President Adams offered him a seat on '
the Supreme bench that had been made
vacant by the death of Judge James Wil
son. This Marshall declined and then the
appointment was given to his friend,
Buahrod Washington.
As the time for the Congressional elec
tions of 179S approached. Marshall was
strongly urged to become a candidate.
Much against hid Inclination he consented
and was elected He served but one Â«eÂ»
slon. During this session the republicans
made a bitter and determined attack up
on the administration. This was because
of the action of the administration In the i
case of Thomas Nash, a British subject,
charged with the crimes of mutiny and
murder. Satisfactory evidence of his
criminality being furnished, he was deliv
ered to the British authorities*. Then he
was tried by court-martial, found guilty
and sentenced to death. The fact that he
had falsely claimed to be an American
citizen led the republicans to introduce
resolutions Into the House of Representa
tives censuring the President and Judge
Bee, the Federal Judge who presided at
the habeas corpus proceedings. Marshall
hxiokc acalnst the resolutions, and com- i
pletely refuted the assumptions of law
on which they were base*!. This was thÂ«
r9 4i. C i aJe l P the Lnit. States of the ex
tradition of an- alleged crlmln.il that arose
under International law. ami was recog

that have since guided the Initnl States

signed. Before his nomination wg.. con
tirmed. however, he was appointed Secre
tary of Btate In place of Timothy Picker
ing, -who, because of differences with
I resident Adams over our difficulties with
France, had been dismissed from offke.
Marshal administered this office with
peat ability. His state papers were clear
logical and unanswerable. This is true
especially of the instructions ho wrote

who was unanimous
ly connrmed. Mar
shall was now &
years old. and till
now had never held
a judicial appoint
ment. The task con
fronting him was a
most difficult one.
There were no pre
cedents and he could
receive but little as
sistance- from books,
but with a profound
mind, a patient .ml
untiring industry
and that strong com
mon sense which Is
ever the ba*ls of
greatness, ho l.tii
the foundation and
reared "a vast e<*.l

rules, under entirely
novel exigencies and
for ends and pur
enÂ»iit and pur
poses never before,
nought." From tho
first ho WJK not on'r
th.- nominal but the
real head of thÂ«
court. He himself
pronounced the mo*t
important decision*
of the court, tils de
cisions are found in some thirty vol
umes of the reports, and these are his
monument. They are characterized by
clearness cf thought and soundness of
lopis- they are, too. the standard and au
thority on all constitutional questions
they treat.
After Marshall went on the bench thÂ«
incidents of his life of public Importance.
are few. In 1907. with Judge Cyrus Grlf
nn. he presided at the great state trial
of Aaron Burr. Burr waa charged with
treason md the trial, with some inter
ruptions, lasted six months. Distinguished
counsel was employed on. both sides. Wil
liam Wlrt representing the prosecution
and Luther Martin the defense. President
Jefferson was very anxious for Burr's
conviction and did what he could to se
cure It. Marshall, however, was not to
be Influenced by this. He preserved "the
most rigid impartiality and exact Justice
throughout the trial, acquitting himself,
as always. to the public satisfaction."
In I<Â£T> \ lrginia called a convention to re
vise her State constitution. Marshall was
a member of this body, an were also eT-
Presldents Madison and Monroe, both t>f
whom were much enfeebled by age. Mar
chall. too, had grown old, but there was
no impairment of his wonderful mental
powers. His chief interest was In the In
dependence of the Judiciary, and to sÂ«
cure this for Virginia he gave his best
energies. He did not speak often: when
he did It was with the same great ef
fect as In earlier life. He remained on
the bench fix years longer. In the spring
of 1533. his health being Impaired, he
went to Philadelphia for medical advice;
he received little benefit, and died there
on the Â«th of July.
In person Marshall was tall: h* dressed
plainly and Is said to have been "some
what awkward In appearance." His pri
vate life was without a blemish and wa<Â«
characterized by "unassuming piety aJkf
amiability of temper." In l>3 he had mar
ried Miss Mary Willis Ambler, the daugh
ter of the State Treasurer of Virginia,
and lived with her for nearly fifty years.
His home was. the constant object of his
affections, and from all its Inmate* he
had the warmest love and the deepest
veneration. America has produced few
statesmen combining so many Intellectual
and moral qualities as Chief Justice John
Marshall.

Fails to Work.
ENGINEER STICKS TO HIS CAB
AMBROSE'S ACTION PREVENTS
SERIOUS DAMAGE.

HiÂ« Prompt Move Saves Oars From
Being Demolished and Possible
Injury to the Passengers
on the Train.

Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call.
!<>S Broadway. Dec. 21.
The Tallvro of a switch on the Oakland
raole to close properly derailed the 1
â¢ clock westbound local train to-day at
i.if "ntrar.ro to â depot aTia-Tlgflâ Op
travel over the mole for nearly an hour.
*>nly the engine was derailed, and beyond
a neverÂ© shaking up the passengers cb
Â«aped Injury. Emrim-cr Ambrose stuck to
lUs rÂ»Â«>st and caved bis train from a
serious wreck.
The cold weather loosened a bolt on one
rt thÂ« fishplates, and when the towerman
la Tower No. 1 throw the lever, the
fwltch failed to rtiÂ«;>ond and did not close.
The signals were all set for a clear track.
but the loose bolt prevented the tongue*
of. the switch from coming together.

ro. That his Honor absolved Alameda
-Cuum> husbaiids from saying anything
about It when they are making breakfast
table explanations next morning is a
fuct which she to-day utterly ignored
while filing a complaint for divorce from
her husbandj James Munro, on the ground
of inrldclity. Mrs. Munro"s investigations
were coiug on before Judge Ogden had
begun figuring on his opinion, and, now
that the Judge has come to the front, she
is determined that his vote-getting views
on "How to Live In Oakland Though
Married" are not to upset a work that
has consumed three years of her time.
In her complaint Mrs. Muni does not
make late hours and sparse explanations
her sole charge against her better half.
She alleges that she was married to Mun
ro. who is an engineer, thirty years ago.
and lived happily wjth him until three
years ago. when ho became addicted to
the late-hour habit. According to Mrs
Munro. it grew on him like a bunch of
San Leandro alfalfa until his absences
rrom the home roof became unbearable.
At one time, tho complaint alleges,
Munro left her and went to Fresno but a
reconciliation was effected subsequently
Then Munro was taken sick and went to a
hospital, and while there, his spouse al
lrges, she opened a letter addressed to
him by a young woman, which wus- of a
sensationally compromising character
After his release from the hospital Mrs
Munro further alleges, her husband was
much In the company of a woman named
Ivaura E. Gray, and she 1p named in her
complaint as co-respondent. The name
of a Miss Curley is also mentioned in con
nection with the case, and in the evidence
which was brought out to-day it was dis
covered that Mrs. Munro had become to
incensed at her husband that she had not
maintained marital relation! with him for
three years past. Upon this showing the
defendant's attorney asked a continuance
until Monday, in order that he might Â«*o
amend the defendant's answer as to in
clude a charge of desertion. The court
granted the continuance.

Will Use His Influence to Have the

OAKLAND. Dec. 21. â Billy Delaney. who
trained Jim Jeffries for his victory over
Sharkey, arrived at his Oakland, home to

nied by his wife and they wire met at the
Sixteenth-street station by Eugene Van

necessary for me to go into details, but I
will simply say that his system of diet

over his training, which he carried out

himsolt at present l will venture to say
that there 1b nobody In my estimation, who

"As to the prospects of another meeting
between Jeffries and Bbarkey, the chances
are very remote. You must â  remember
JÂ«-ft is now matched to meet Corbett, and
it is not professional to run Sharkey in at
this time. As to th-s Jeffries-Corbett mill.
I would merely say that Brady is the
manager and I am in tho dark, but on
general principles I think Jeffries ought to

will draw as big a crowd In San Fran

shall exert every effort to secure the
match for this coast.

ARMY BUTTON CAUSES
A FIRM'S DISSOLUTION
OAKLAND. Dec. 21.â The well-known law firm of McKlroy & McElrath
will shortly dissolve, ami all on account of a O. A. R. button that (or
years has filled a buttonhole on* Colonel McElrny coat lapel. The
colonel was an officer In the Grand Army of the Republic during "the
late unpleasantness," and Major McElrath wat likewise offlciully p-om-
Inont in the Confederate army, and the firm was familiarly known among the
local Justinian? as "the blue and the pray." Occasionally the two attorney!!
would swap reminircenees, and it Is understood that during the exploitation
of one of these recently the major of the South said to the colonel of the
North:
"If I were you Id not wear that button In my coat lapel on all occa
sions."
The colonel registered a vigorous exception, and. hearing no sustaining
voice, vows now that he will no longer fight In the legal arena with the South
ern major as his ally.
"The major is a good attorney." said Colonel McElroy to-day. "but he
kicked on my G. A. R. button, and it's all off. I don't propose to stand any
more kicking about that button that I hold so dearly as a reminder of the up
holding of the Union. Yes, I propose that the firm be dissolved. The big li
brary Is mine. and. though I am well along In years. I will get on very well
without a partner."
So. too. does Major McElrath nay:
"The colonel Is a good lawyer, but we were really never partners. We
simply worked together on certain cases. Oh. there's been no trouble, and
we are as good friends as ever clasped hands between the North and
South." * .â '". â¢â " Â.--.. â¢ â¢
was doing and was told that he had
come to attend dm That surprised
me. for I did not know that I had been
hurt. I have had no feeling except a
headache from the blow."
The way In which Miss Green was
found by her brother Walter is most
important In considering the way In
which the assault might have been
made When found she was leaning
against the stone coping that sur
rounds the vacant lot. This coping Is
about three feet highâ sufficiently high
to have supported her were she to
have leaned against it. Bhe was erect
at the time when found, and though
she spoke to her brother and called
him by name she has no recollection
of having seen him. Her recognition
of her brother under these circum
stances Is the more remarkable from
the fact that Walter Green says that
It was bo dark that he did not recog
nize his sister until she spoke to him.
Thfl assault must have occurrrd
within a very few moments before she
â¢was Bound, for Mrs. Qreen says that
â¢ichfiT was only thn-*- or four
minutes late in gt-ttinc home.
There waa a great tear found in tho
front of Miss Oreen'l <lr*>ss when she
got home. The police tried to explain
this tear by saying that thf> young
lady fainted, and that In trying to g*Â»t
up she put her knee or foot on her
dress and tore It. This is not likely,
for the dross is torn from the outside.
while the lining on the Inside Is whole.
This torn drasj gives some evidence
of a struggle, but if any there was it
followed the blow upon the head thnt
destroyed Miss Oreea't memory, for
Fhe says that she is pure that then
was no assault before she lost con-
FciousneHs fr.m th<- Mow.
Dr. A. H. Pratt, who attended the
young lady, says that the Mow was
delivered by som<> blunt Instrument,
and not by a knifÂ«- or an ax. The hair
is not cut. but the scalp Is. and had

on an attack of nervous paralysis and he
was taken home In a very bad condition.
This attack of nervous paralysis wu
largely due to the bad physical condition
of the young soldier, who had been
wounded In the Philippines and was homo
on sick leave. He was shot in the fumou.-j
charge at Zapota bridge, when Clenerui
I.awtun made his attack upon the Insur
gents south of Manila. Lieutenant Awry
was hit in the thigh, and malarial fever
set In, making his condition so be that
he secured a leave of absence and re
turned to his California home. ThU sick
leave had almost expired, and he was
making efforts to have it renewed when
this attack came.
Howard Avery was one of the most pop
ular students In the State University.
When the war with Spain broke out he
enlisted in the Fourteenth United State*
regulars as a private, and before h*
reached Manila he was made a corporal.
Though a university graduate, he did nut
hesitate to serve his country as a cummnn
soldier. In Manila he displayed the great
est bravery. He was one of the smalt
party that, under Captain Miles, captures
Block 11. . i. 14 In a charge that will go
down In history*- The party was nearly
all killed, but Avery reached the block
house with â  few others. For this he wa*
recommended for promotion to a lieuten
ancy. While In the trenches and on thra
tiring line he studied for his examination
and was finally passed and secured hla
commission.

FIRING FINAL SHOTS
IN BOND CAMPAIGN
Continued from Seventh Page.
line of Valencia and the cross streets, are
in hearty co-operation with the panhandle
proposition. At a meeting of the associa
tion last night President Fred L. Walbel.
who is one of the vice presidents of the
mass meeting held In Turn Verein Hall
on Wednesday evening, stated that as
progressive business men who were agi
tating the pavement of Valencia street,
they could not well afford to remain silent
on the bond is?ue.
The opening up of the Golden Gate pan
handle to Van Xtf.s avenue and the ex
tension of the two wings leading north
: and couth was a move in the direction
of progress, and the Mission Association
of Merchants, who favored tin: repave
ment of Valencia street from Market to
nty-eixih. could not well afford to op
pose it.
Eugene McCoy, one of the most active
. members of the association, coincided
with the views of the president, and stat
ed on behalf of the Mission Business
Men's Association that all the members
had plt-dgtd their united support for all
th>- bond lasaea. Secretary Harrison's
, views wcrt In full accord with those of
the speakers, as by the issuing of bonds
, for improvements Valencia and the other
streetE in the Mission were bound to he
taken notice of. The position which Va
lencia street occupied on the map of San
Francisco, together with Its Importance
as the only leading outlet from the prin
cipal center of the city into San Mateo
County, would of itself force the im
provement so much sought for by the
nu-rchants and property owners, not to
mention the thousands of persons who
monthly travel over that thoroughfare.
Other members of the association spoke
i of the justice, of giving to the Mission
I the two cemetery lots asked for as a park
for the people residing In that portion of
the city. The Dolores boulevard, as pro
posed, was a necessity in itself for the
accommodation of the people who owned
â  buggies and bicycles, as It would lead
directly Into the greater park by toe pro
posed panhandle.
It was ftnally decided to support the
bond issues for all that is contained In
the call for the two elections as measures
of progress and improvements.
Listened Whi c They Ate.
Hundreds of workingmen on the water
i front with lunches in hand gathered
around the impromptu platform from
i which Mayor Phelan spoke during the
I noon hour yesterday. His first speech was
delivered from a case of goods at the Hall
1 dock; his second from a lumber pile on
the transport dock. A band wagon en
livened the proceedings and proved a
great success la attracting crowds at both
places.
The Mayor said that to the workingmen
there can be but one view taken of tho
bond question.
"Surely by this time," said he, "It must
be clear to all that there is no Jobbery
about this attempt to improve our city.
fc'ome ill-ad\ised talkers have said that
i we are playing a confidence game by cay
! ing that these . â  mi.- will give work to the
laboring in.tf-.~ea. and they dt-ny our
claims that the- expenditure of Jll.'XW.ooO
will be a direct and lasting benefit to the
individual and to the community. Now.
If this be so, where Is the money going
that will be raised by bonds! Is the new
charter such a piece of folly that it will
permit our new city government to steal
and waste tho people's money, as in the
time that has passed? Then what? Every
dollar will stay right here and go into
j your pockets. Twelve of the fifteen men
who made your new charter declare that
the proper thing for us to do at this time
ls to vote to Issue air the bonds. The Â«if
i fair is all open and above board; there is
Ino secrecy about it. You can all Investi
gate it. and from what I have seen during
| my experience of public life I can truly
] Fay that the rkingmen of this city as a
rule vote with more discrimination than
any other class. I could seek easier tasks
! than to try to emm a fallacy down the
FOUND NO SEPULCHER.
Body of a Dead Woman Neglected by
Her Husband.
OAKMNIi. Dec. 21.â A1l day lonj? the
body Of a woman hue remained In a cotlln
nn a truck at Slx'eenth-street station.
Oakland, and no effort upon the part of
the Coroner has availed In locatlnK l- P.
Fifcher. the man who shipped the body,
but who has fuilc-d to make proper ar
rangements for its disposition upon Its
arrival at Oakland. The body is that of
Mrs. Ella P. Fisher, th. wife of the man
who shipped the body. FiÂ«hÂ«r arrived on
the Ortuon overland this morning with
the body of his Â«rtfÂ« shipped as baggage
and checks Just as he would have
checked a trunk.
When Fisher arrived at the station he
gave the check lor the coffin to the Peo
ple's Express Company of Oakland, with
instructions to take the article called for
by the check to Mountain View Cemetery.
The express company thought that it iras
an ordinary trunk, coming as baggage,
and they took the check, while Fisher
went to Oakland. When the express com
pany found that there was a- body in the
oiilin they refused to handle it at all and
left it with the^station master. Ho also
refused to handle it. and left It on the
truck on the station platform. There it
remained all day and into the night. Cor
oner Mehrmann was notllk-d, but he re
fubed to do anything until to-morrow
morning. Efforts were made to find j
Fisher, but these were unavailing, and
the station agent at Sixteenth street is
afraid that he will have to face ghosts
during the night.
At Mountain View Cemetery a grave,
had been prepared for the reception of a
body to-day, but the necessary permits
had not been secured, and the cemetery
auihoritles n-fu.sed to give any further in
formation. Meanwhile the body is still at
the ruilroud station.

I John W. (or Johannes \V., or Johannei> and
throats of the audience that I am now
facing:. ...
"The difficulty of the opponents of this
measure is that they will not take the
trouble to investigate the facts,. but de
clare that what was good enough for the
last generation is good enough for this,
and you cannot drive anything more rea-Â»
sonable Into their heads. The same men
would prefer a stage road to a Pullman,
a barn to a comfortable bouse, bare walls
to pictures-, rags to decent clothes and so
on. :-r.il tin V. where would labor go and
what prospect would there he for a work
tiifrman to earn decent wages and have
what is his rightâ a happy home. Sllurl
anlsm Is of the time when education and
comfort were for the rich alone, and when
the man of toll was contemptuously re
ferred to as a poor man. We di not live
In those times, thank God, but we live In
an age of progress, and one of the re
sponsibilities that comes with this privi
lege i* to beautify and make healthful
our homes and to make our children inde
pendent by giving them propoi- education.
To do this is the only reason why you
should vote for all the bonds."
At the conclusion of his speeches the
Mayor was loudly cheered

RIPPEY SAID SHE WAS
JAMES FAIR'S CHILD
LITTLE Charlotte B. Gergory
ceased drawing pictures of the
bailiff and listened with breath
less interest yesterday morning
when Attorney Robert Ash took
' the- Bland in Judge Troutt's court and
j paid that Wesley C. Rippey told him
' that he could prove that James G.
i Fair Jr. was the lather of the llttlo
â¢ girl. This evidence occasioned the first
â¢ surprise during the trial of the contest
â  Instituted by Robert Ash of the will of
â¢ the Ir.te Mrs. Catherine E. Gregory,
', who died recently, leaving an estate
, valued at 120.000. Mr*. Gregory was
| little Charlotte's foster mother, and by
. the terms of a will executed Decem
i ber 10. 1595. she devised her entire
â¢ estate to the child, subject, however.
â¢ to a life estate vested In Mrs.
'y Martha Munson. proponent of the will. in whose care the deceasM placed
, the child Just prior to her death. This will, being of later date, defeated the
> purpose of a testament made by Mrs. Gregory March 22, ISM, in which she
â¢ devised one-haJf of her estate to Ash. the contestant.
I Ash testified that the later will was written by Wesley C. Rlppey. the
â¢ old man who shot John W. Mackay In I.lck alley Borne years ago, and was
\ not signed by Mrs. Gregory. Ash .said that Rippey was a warm friend of
'y Mrs. Munpon and often told Mrs. Gregory that If the will was made to suit
. him matters would be all right as he could prove that the child was the
I daughter of young Jim Fair and that the latter"* father had promised to
pay 1100,000 to keep the matter a secret and to protect the memory of his
! son.
â¢ Notwithstanding the statement alleged to have been made by Rippey. who
Is now dead, the parentage of the child will forever remain a secret. If Rip
pey had proofs they died with him. as did Mrs. Gregory's knowledge of little
Charlotte's kin. The child In evidently fond of Mrs. MunÂ» n and uncon
cerned over the prominent place she occupies In the litigation.
After Ash had retired from the stand Mrs. Munson was called by the
defense. She acknowledged that Rippey wrote the will, as alleged by the
defense, but said that It was at Mrs. Gregory*! suggestion.
"Mrs. Gregory did not want Ash to know that she had made another
will," said Mrs. Munson. "but she felt that she bad done considerable for
him during her life, having purchased him several suits of clothes and as
sisted him in many other ways. She was anxious that her child should have
the entire estate and knew that I would care for her. bo she got Rippey to
write the Will, which was not published until after her death. The hearing
of the case will go on next Monday.
BIG OIL LAND
STEAL PLANNED
Prompt Steps Taken to
Prevent It.
Filial Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.â
Representative â¢ :ham. when asked to
day by a Call correspondent why ho had
asked the Land Office to suspend entry
upon land In the oil district in Cali
fornia, stated that he had done so because
it had been represented to him by a large
number of his constituents that there was
about to be attempted a gigantic steal
of these land?, engineered by certain well
known land â harks in California.
It was represented to Mr. Needham that
theso gentlemen had got hold of a large
body of forest reserve script and were
about to use it to obtain title to oil lands,
in violation of the spirit if not the letter
of the law. In order to obtain title to the
land with forest reserve script the locator
must swear that the land located is agri
cultural. The oil land in California is clas
sified in the Land Office as agricultural,
but a* a matter of fact almost all of it
has lain unoccupied since the admission
of California. very few settlers wanted
to pre-empt or homestead it, because it is
utterly unlit for farming or grazing pur
poses.
To stop this fraudulent attempt of script
men to gain title to these valuable oil
lands Mr. Needham has been before Com
missioner Hermann a number of times.
The Land Office has put the brakes on
and understands the situation, It has is
sued an order that the locator of land
with forest reserve script must publish
notice of his location in the nearest news
paper and must affirmatively prove that
the land thus located is agricultural in
character. Commissioner Hermann In
formed Mr. Worxlhsm that, this order
would be held retroactive. .
Mr. Needham has made request that all
land In the oil region be withdrawn from
entry with a view to re-examination and
reelassltlcatlon, but the department holds
this cannot be done, as reclassiflcatlon Is
only to be had of railroad land grants.
However, order of publication and proof
as above aH forth will practically operate
as a reclacsiflcation.

WENT TO THE GRAVE WITH
SECRET OF HER DOWNFALL
MISS EDITH HOWLAND of V*
Munich street, a prepossessing
young woman of twenty-two
summers, died yesterday after
noon at St. Luke's Hospital, carrying
with her to the grave a secret that
the authorities have endeavored to
unravel. Three weeks ago Miss How
land went K. Mrs. Wolf, an acquaint
ance, residing at 22 Maple street, and
told her that she was seriously ill.
AVhen she finished her story *hÂ«
fainted in the arms of her friend. Dr.
B. N. TorrcUo was called to attend
her, and after admlni.sterin{r_stimu
lant? and revlvinÃ her attempted to
get from her the caOM Of her illness.
She stubhornly refused to tell her
f=tory and v her condition was critical
the doctor had her removed to St.
Lukes Hospital.
While she was there she was visited
frequently by* Albert Villlere. who
Ka-ve his residence as 17M Market
street. It was apparent to all of the
attendant* that the young man was
the sweetheart Â«>f the deceased. He
visited her yesterday afternoon and
at that time she had so far recovered
that she was in a condition to sit on
the porch of the hospital and expected
to leave it In a few days.
The couple had a long and earnest
conversation. After the young man
l<*ft the place the patient told the at
tendant that Villiere was going to
leave for Los Angeles on the steamer
in the afternoon and that she never
expected to see him again. She ap
peared to be very much dejected after

INDICTMENT OF
PRUTTON WILL
NOW BE ASKED
â¢ â¦
Peculiar Sequel to a
Damage Suit.
RAILROAD GIVEN JUDGMENT
In obedience to an order made by Judge
Cook. Assistant District Attorney Solo
man will go before the Grand Jury and
place before It a verified complaint, by
which John Prutton sought to recover
$10,000 damages from the Market Street
Railway Company for personal Injuries,
the object being to secure an Indictment
against Prutton for perjury alleged to
have been committed when he verified the
complaint in question. Mr. Prutton, who
has been laboring near Sunol for some
time past. Is now in the city, having ar
rived last evening, and Instead of prepar
ing himself to resist the proposed criminal
proceedings will Immediately make a mo
tion for a new trial of his case, which
was decided against him by a Jury in
Judge Cook's court yesterday.
The facts of the case are peculiar. Prut
ton was found unconscious near the Mis
sion street tracks, between Fourth and
Fifth streets, on the night of February 2
last. He admitted being intoxicated on
the night in qtestlon. and said that a-i
he was crossing the street he saw a c.ir
appear In front of him, and he remem
bered nothing more. Subsequent! two
witnesses to the accident. William Cava
naugh and John Hogan. were discovered,
and after the injured man had placed his
case in the hands of Attorney Louis P.
Boardman they came forward and made
statements regarding the cause of the ac
cident, which the attorney now holds.
Cavanaugh. who Is a marine fireman and
resides at 84-JA Mission street, said:
On the night of the M of February at
about 11 4... I was with Mr. llnÂ«ran on the
south side of Mission street, between Third
and Fourth, on my way home, when I saw
a green car of the Mission-street line strike
the man, whose name I do not know. The
car was going about ten miles per hour,
the man was drunk and in plain sight in
the middle of the street, and had the motor
man been looking out he need not have
struck the man. Mr. Hogan called "mop
the car, you have run over I man." They
paid no attention and r-nnttmjprt on their
way. Two officers came up the street and
rang for the patrol. They did not see the
accident, but we told them that he was
struck by a green car. A third party came
up and the officer drove him off. He did
not stay until the patrol came up, but went
home.
In his statement Hogan testified as fol
lows:
On the night of the 2d of February ISM
at exactly 11:45 o'clock. I was on Mission
street, on the south side, when John Prutton
was struck by a Mlsulon-street car. The
car was a green car. and was going west
at the rate of ten miles per hour or m IT*.
The street waa perfectly clear, no wagons
or anything In sight. 1 saw the man (John
Prutton) when he left the sidewalk. The
car was then some forty feet or more from
the place where the accident occurred.
The grlpman or motorman could have seen
the man In plenty of time to avoid the
accident had he been looking. lie rang no
bell, and the man did not see the car until
It was on him. The man was crossing from
north to south, and when the car struck
htm It knocked him toward the sidewalk.
The motorman made no effort to stop thÂ»
car until too late, and then continued on
his way without stopping. Mr. Cavanaugh
who was with me. called to the motorman
to stop and help take care of the man he
had run down, but he made no answer. The
conductor looked around and saw what had
happened, but paid no attention to It. The
man lay In the street in plain sight two
or three feet from the rail. I could tell
when the man left the sidewalk that h*
was drunk, and the motorman could have
seen. too, were he attending to his business
The man staggered plainly. I stood there
until a policeman rang in for the patrol
The man. I think, was Mr. GtilynnT who
came up on the car behind. I rave thÂ»
officer my name and address and then
went home.
Both statements were witnessed by un
interested parties, hut when the case wai
ready for trial neither witness material
ized. Wednesday. however. Attorney
Boardman says, when the case was called
both were in court, and on being ad
dressed said that they had been <*nr>i e
naed by the railroad and had been pold
their witness fees. Shortly after this the
case was called, and Mr Boardman asked
for a continuance on the ground that hÂ«
could not find the plaintiff, and this wns j
granted in view of the fact that he con
sented to draw a Jury and let the cast go
to trial yesterday morning. Pratt on, not !
having received his notification, failed to
show up yesterday morning, but Judge
Cook refused to entertain a motion for Â«i
continuance, and the. case went to trial.
Hognn and Cavanaugh being absent, the
defendant put on several street car oper
ators, all of whom testified that they did
not ceo the plaintiff ruck by a car. und
Officer Glynn testified that he found the
plaintiff beside the railway, an Iron bar
about a foot long near his prostrate body.
Although the plaintiff 's DOSS was frac
tured and bleeding and his head cut. no
blood was on the bar, which the defend
ant endeavored to connect with his in-
Jury. â¢
After the officer left the stand Mr.
Boardman requested the court to allot*
his witnesses to testify. They were nut
in court, and even In the face of the fact
that they had stated that they were sub- j
penaed by the company Mr. Boardman |
asked for a continuance that they might j
he found. Judge Cook denied tn* motion,
instructed the jury and a verdict ma*
found in favor of the defendant. A mo
tion for a new trial will he mad", how
â¢Ver, and Interesting developments are
expected.
